Cook's notes: Star anise, fish sauce, hoisin sauce and Asian chili sauce
are available at Asian markets or some supermarkets with large Asian
specialty sections. Use caution when working with fresh chilies. Upon
completion of slicing, wash work surface and hands thoroughly; do not
touch your eyes.
Procedure: Combine the beef stock, ginger, star anise, green onions and
fish sauce and gently simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the ginger, anise
and green onions. Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes.
Slice the green onions, onion and basil leaves as thinly as possible.
Slice the beef as thinly as possible across the grain. It helps to
partially freeze the meat before slicing.  Bring 4 quarts water to a boil.
Arrange the bean sprouts, mint sprigs, chilies and lime on a platter.
Just before serving, bring the broth to a boil. Cook the rice sticks in
boiling water for 30 seconds, then drain.
Presentation: Divide the noodles among 4 large bowls. Arrange the
scallions, onion slices and beef slices on top. Spoon the boiling broth on
top: The heat of the liquid should be sufficient to cook the meat.
Serve the soup at once, with the garnish platter on the side. Let each
person add sprouts, mint, chilies, lime, hoisin sauce and/or chili sauce
to taste.
