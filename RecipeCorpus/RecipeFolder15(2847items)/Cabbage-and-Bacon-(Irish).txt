Title: Cabbage and Bacon (Irish)
Categories: Irish, Main dish, Vegetables, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
4 x  Whole allspice berries
300 ml Bacon or chicken stock
1 x  Lg or 2 small Savoy cabbages
8 x  Strips bacon
1 x  Salt and pepper
Cut the cabbage in half and boil for 15 minutes in salted water.  Drain,
and soak in cold water for 1 minute, then drain well and slice.  Line the
bottom of a casserole with half the bacon strips, then put the cabbage on
top and add the seasonings.  Add enough stock to barely cover, then put
the remaining strips of bacon on top.  Cover and simmer for an hour, until
most of the liquid is absorbed.
