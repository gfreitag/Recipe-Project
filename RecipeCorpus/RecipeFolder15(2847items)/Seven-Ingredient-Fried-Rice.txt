Categories: Rice, Pasta
Yield: 4 servings
-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------

1 ts sugar
1 ea clove garlic, crushed
2 tb oil
3 tb low-sodium soy sauce
2 tb water
2 tb rice vinegar
1 tb oyster sauce
---------------------------------RICE DISH---------------------------------
1/2 c  Red or green pepper, diced
3 c  Cooked, cooled rice
1 c  Sugar snap peas or snow peas
1 ea small yellow  onion
1 1/2 c  Celery, cut on the diagonal
1 c  Carrots, cut on the diagonal
1 c  Cooked, cubed meat, any
* Rice should be preferably a day old. Remove stems from peas. Meat can be
lean chicken, turkey or pork.
Combine all the ingredients for the sauce in a 2-cup mixing bowl. Stir
vigorously with a fork until the sugar has dissolved.  Place near the
stove where it will be handy.
Assemble the remaining ingredients near the stove in individual piles or
dishes. Precook the carrots 1 minute in a microwave oven on high (100
percent) power. The carrots also may be blanched in boiling water 2
minutes to tenderize them.
Place the oil in a wok or large skillet, Set over high heat and allow oil
to become quite hot.  Add the onions first, stirring occasionally until
they begin to caramelize and turn brown around the edges. Add the celery
and stir 2 minutes longer. Add the carrots, meat and bell pepper and cook
2 minutes longer, stirring constantly.
Add the rice all at once, stirring quickly to mix all ingredients. (Some
rice may begin to stick to the sides of the wok or skillet, but continue
stirring.) Add the peas and pour in sauce mixture.  Stir until mixture is
evenly colored with the sauce. Remove from heat and serve immediately.
Test kitchen notes: The choice of ingredients is up to the cook. If
desired, substitute bulb fennel or green onions for celery; peeled,
deveined and cooked shrimp or lump crab meat for the meat; or English
peas for snow peas. Remember to use low-fat ingredients to keep the
