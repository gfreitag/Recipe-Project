Title: Salsa (Sweet & Mild)
Categories: Salsa
Yield: 50 servings
1 ea Large yellow onion
1 tb Garlic powder
1 ts Ground red pepper
1 ea Small bunch - parsley
4 lb Tomatoes, peeled, chopped
1 ea Large red bell pepper
1 ea Large Green bell pepper
4 ea Jalopeno peppers
Peel the tomatoes and chop. Cut and seed all the peppers. Place tomatoes
in food processor and blend well, (should still be slightly lumpy). Place
in large pot and bring to a boil. Place red pepper in food processor and
chop until very fine. Add to tomatoes. Process onion and add to mix in
pot. Process remaining ingredients and stir into tomato mix. Cook, to
reduce liquid, about 15 to 20 minutes at a slow boil. Drain in strainer
and place in jars. Add enough liquid just to make juicy. If salsa is to be
consumed within a week, store in refrigerator. If salsa is to be stored
longer - it needs to be canned by normal processes. Makes about 3 to 4
pints.
