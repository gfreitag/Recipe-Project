Title: Muscat Ice
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
6 oz Caster sugar
225 g  Greek strained yoghurt
1 1/2 lb Tart green gooseberries
3    Heads elderflower blossoms*
*Note: You may use 3 OR 4 heads of elderflower blossom.

Put the gooseberries into a heavy-based saucepan or casserole.  The fruit
should be still damp from rinsing under the tap but there is no point in
spending time topping and tailing it as it is going to be sieved.  Add the
florets of elder blossom, stripped from their stalks, and bury them among
the fruit.  Cover tightly and cook in a low oven until the fruit is tender
and pulpy - I allow 1 hour or so at 275-300 F (140-150 C) gas mark 1 or 2.
Or cook over a very gentle flame if preferred.

Add the sugar and stir until it no longer feels gritty.  Then rub the fruit
and every drop of its sugary juices through a sieve to make a perfectly
smooth seeless puree.  As soon as it is cold, spoon the pale aromatic puree
into a chilled loaf tin, cover it and freeze.

About an hour later, when the ice is firm around the edges but still soft
in the centre, beat it or whizz it in a food-processor until mushy. Gently
fold in the yoghurt, cover and freeze until solid all the way through.

Then turn out the ice-cream, beat it again to break up any ice crystals and
transfer it to 8 petit pots de chocolat.  Cover and freeze until about 1
hour before serving, when the ice-cream should be placed in the fridge to
"ripen" it.  Amaretti biscuits go very well with this.
