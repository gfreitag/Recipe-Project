Title: Mock Fried Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Herb Seasoning
1 ts Nonfat Dry Milk
2 tb dry vermouth
4 ea chicken breasts
1/2 c  bread crumbs
1/4 ts cracked black pepper
Bone the chicken.  Remove the skin and discard.  Trim any fat (the
yellow stuff).  Cut each breast in half (just cut across, nothing
fancy).  Combine the bread crumbs, pepper, seasoning, and milk on
a plate.  Place the vermouth on a second plate.  'Swirl' each breast
in the vermouth and then roll in the bread crumbs.  Be sure to cover
the breast entirely with bread crumbs.  Place in a shallow baking dish
(not necessary to grease) and bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.
