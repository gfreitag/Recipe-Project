Title: Slow Cooker Pot Roast
Categories: Beef, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 5 servings
1/4 ts Coarsely ground pepper
1 ea Flour to cover the roast
1 ea pinch Salt
8 oz water (1/2 tomato can)
3 lb Chuck Roast
1 1/2 ea Medium onions - chopped
2 ea garlic cloves - minced
16 oz can stewed tomatoes
2 tb oil
1 TB Worcesteshire sauce
I used the 4 qt Westbend which has a removable cooking pot which can be
used to brown the roast on the stove top....  Saute onion & garlic  with
oil in the cooking pot until transparent.  Season the roast with Salt &
Pepper and then dredge (lightly) in flour.  Brown roast (on top of the
onions & garlic) in the cook-pot on both sides (10 min).  Transfer to the
slow cooker, add the stewed tomatoes, water and Worcesteshire sauce.
Cooked on setting 4 (of 5) for about 5 hrs.  When done, puree the
remaining tomatoes, juices & onions, return to pan, add thickener for
gravy...  That's it!    It was wonderful!
