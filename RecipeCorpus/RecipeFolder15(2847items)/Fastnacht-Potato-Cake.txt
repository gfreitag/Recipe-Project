Boil the pared potatoes in enough water to cover them. Drain off the potato
water and save. Mash the potatoes and beat lightly. Measure the potato
water and add more water, if necessary, to make 1 1/2 pints. Combine with
the rest of the ingredients, using enough flour to make a rather stiff
batter. Cover and let rise in a warm place until morning. Knead in the
morning, adding as much flour as is necessary. Let rise again. Spread on
well-greased tins and when light (about 1-1/4 hours) brush melted butter
over top. Strew with "rivels" made by combining 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup
flour, and 2 Tbsp butter.
