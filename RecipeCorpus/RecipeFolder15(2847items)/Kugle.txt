Title: Kugle
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish, Casseroles
Yield: 4 servings
Salt
Pepper
4    (or more) cloves of garlic
1/4 c  Olive oil
6    Baking potates
-(peeled if you like)
1/4 c  Milk
2    Eggs
Chop potatoes in food processor (I do not have a food processor so I grate
them on a cheese grater.. this works WONDERFUL)  The food processor tends
to overprocess the potatoes.  Combine the potatoes with milk, eggs, crushed
garlic, salt & pepper.  Pour the olive oil into a suitable baking dish and
mix the potato mixture in with it. (make sure the oil is mixed in well).
Bake at 400~ for 40 minutes. The thickness of the potatoes should be about
an inch in the casserole dish.
