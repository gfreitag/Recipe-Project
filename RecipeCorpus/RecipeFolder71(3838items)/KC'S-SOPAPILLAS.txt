Title: KC'S SOPAPILLAS
Categories: Breads, Mexican
Yield: 3 Dozen
4 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1 tb Lard or oleo
1 pk Dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
1 1/4 c  Scalded Milk, apx.
1 qt Oil for deep frying
Honey
Combine first 3 ingredients, cut in shortening until
crumbly. Dissolve yeast in warm water, add milk (at
room temperature). Make a well in the center of the
flour, add liquid and work into a soft dough. Add more
liquid, if necessary, in small amounts, to form a firm
and springy dough that holds it shape.

Turn out onto a floured surface. Knead 15-20 times.
Cover with a bowl and let rest for 10 minutes. Heat
oil to apx. 400 degress. Work 1/4 of dough at a time.
Roll to 1/4 " thickness. Cut into 3" to 4" squares or
triangles. Slightly stretch each piece. Drop into the
oil, 2 at a time, top side down. Hold down in the oil,
gently pressing around the edges, not the middle. When
lightly browned and puffy, remove to paper towels and
drain. Serve still warm and drizzle with honey.
