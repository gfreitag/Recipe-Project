Title: KEN & LAURA'S AMAZING IMPROMPTU SWEET-N-SOUR
Categories: Chinese, Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 2 Servings
1/4 c  Chopped scallions
2    Cloves garlic, minced
Canola oil (sesame
-oil would work well,
-too)
1 c  Snow pea pods, de-stringed
1 sm Yellow zucchini squash,
-sliced
1 1/2 c  Broccoli (florets and
-stems, cut into small
-pieces)
12 oz Straw mushrooms
1/2 c  Bean sprouts
1/2 c  Water chestnuts
1/2 c  Bamboo shoots
1/4 c  Chopped red bell pepper
1 sm Can pineapple chunks
-(unsweetened, be sure
-to save the juice)
1 sm Can mandarin orange slices
1    Ripe mango, peeled, seeded,
-and sliced
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Tamari
Pineapple juice (leftover
-from the can)
3 tb Cornstarch (or enough
-to make desired thickness)
2 tb Water
2 ts Grated fresh ginger
First to go in the wok was the oil, scallions, and
garlic.  Use enough oil so that it'll coat all the
veggies but not make them slimy (I'd say about 1/2 -
2/3 c.).  Heat these ingredients until the garlic
starts to turn brown. Then add the pea pods, squash,
and broccoli.  Cook about 3-5 min. Then add the bean
sprouts, water chestnuts, bamboo, and peppers. Cook
for a few more minutes, until veggies are slightly
tender but still sort of crisp.
Then add the pineapple, oranges, and mango.  Cook
about a minute, then add the sauce.  When the sauce
starts bubbling, the stir-fry is done.
Serve over rice.  Yum!
