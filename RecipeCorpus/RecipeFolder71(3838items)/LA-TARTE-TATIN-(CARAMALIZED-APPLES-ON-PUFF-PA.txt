*DIRECTIONS*

FOR PASTRY: Preheat oven to 300F. Roll pastry 1/8-inch thick. Cut into
circle 1 inch larger than diameter of 1-quart souffle dish. Transfer
to baking sheet, prick with fork and bake 30 minutes. If not quite
browned, increase heat to 350 F and continue baking until nicely
colored. Let cool on wire rack. Heat oven to 350F. Combine 1/2 cup
sugar with water in 8-inch skillet and cook, swirling pan frequently,
until caramelized. Pour into 1-quart souffle dish.  Begin adding
apples, arranging vertically (fill dish as compactly as possible
since fruit will shrink during baking). Lay remaining apples (or as
many as possible) on top. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup sugar and
cinnamon. Pour melted butter evenly over top. Cover with foil, making
several slits to allow steam to escape. Lay piece of foil on lower
oven rack to catch any juices that might overflow. Bake, basting
frequently, until apples are tender, about 1-1/2 hours. Remove from
oven and cool 15 minutes. Carefully pour off juices into 8-inch
skillet and boil over medium-high heat until reduced and caramelized.
Run knife around inside of souffle dish to loosen apples. Set pastry
over fruit. Place serving plate on top and invert. Pour caramelized
juices over top. Heat heavy skillet until quite hot. Dust tarte with
sugar and hold bottom of hot skillet over top of tarte to sear sugar,
or place under broiler. Repeat 3 more times. Serve warm or cold.

Serves 4.
