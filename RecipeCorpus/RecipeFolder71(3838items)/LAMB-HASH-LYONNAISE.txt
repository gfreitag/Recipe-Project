the trick) combine with the above mixture. Blend well and transfer to
a lightly oiled baking dish.

NOTES: We had a fair bit of roast lamb over after a family Easter
dinner and thoug we would try a "Leftover" recipe. This is what we
did and it made quite an acceptable dinner. The recipe below,which
came from Hazel Meyer's Freezer Cook Book, just invites
improvisation. (For instance, we had no lamb gravy and used some beef
Oxo dissolved in hot water). This may have been done before on this
List but, if not, perhaps we might get some postings on what do do
with leftovers of various kinds of meat? The cook book we have has
other leftover recipes and, if there is interest,we could post them
from ti to time.
