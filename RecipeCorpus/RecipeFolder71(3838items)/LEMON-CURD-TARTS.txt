Title: LEMON CURD TARTS
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 30 Servings
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Shortening
3    Eggs, well beaten
1 1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Finely shredded lemon peel
1/3 c  Lemon juice
Blueberries
Sift together the flour and salt; cut in the shortening until the
mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon water over
part of the mixture. Gently toss with a fork and push to side of
bowl. Repeat with 3 or 4 more tablespoons of water until all is
moistened. Form dough into a ball. Roll out to 1/16-inch thickness.
Cut into 3- inch circles. Fit into small tart pans; press out
bubbles.  Prick dough with tines of fork. Bake in a 450 F oven for 8
to 10 minutes until shells are golden.

For lemon curd, in a saucepan combine the eggs, sugar, lemon juice,
and butter.  Cook and stir over low heat until thickened, about 15
minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon peel. Chill. Fill each
baked shell with 2 to 3 teaspoons of filling; chill.  Just before
serving, top with blueberries.

Makes 30 tartlets.
