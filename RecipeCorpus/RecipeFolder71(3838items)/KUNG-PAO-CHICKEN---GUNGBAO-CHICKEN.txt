Title: KUNG PAO CHICKEN - GUNGBAO CHICKEN
Categories: Chinese, Chicken
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Chicken
2 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Cornstarch
1 tb Rice wine
2 1/2 oz Peanuts
4    Scallions
8    Dried chiles
3 sl Ginger
2 ts Sugar
2 ts Sesame oil
Oil for frying
Dice the chicken: marinate for 30 minutes in 1 tb soy,
the cornstarch and rice wine. Cut the scallions into 1
in. pieces and the chiles in half (they are assuming
you are using small ones).

Heat the oil and deep fry the chicken dice for 2
minutes. Drain well. Reheat the oil and fry peanuts
for 3 minutes. Drain. Heat a pan with 3 TB of oil and
stir fry ginger, scallions and chiles. And chicken
dice and stir fry for another minute before stirring
in 1 tb soy and the sugar. Adjust the seasonings and
stir in the peanuts. Serve sprinkled with sesame oil.

[Note: I believe this recipe assumes the use of raw
peanuts. If you are using roasted peanuts, omit the
deep fry.]
