Anchovies seem to have a natural affinity with veal - consider ossi
buci, for instance. those not in the know usually cannot pick the
presence of anchovies in this pot-roasted dish, but they do rave
about the flavour.

With the tip of a very sharp knife, make incisions all over the
surface of a leg of veal.  Into each incision, stuff a sliver of
garlic and a small anchovy fillet. Also insert into the meat 4 to 6
cloves.

Pour a little of the oil in which the anchovies were packed into the
palm of your hand, rub your hands together and rub them all over the
surface of the meat.

Put the leg of veal into an oven proof casserole or Pyrex chicken
roaster, dust with pepper and surround with slices of 2 large onions.

Add a couple of bay leaves and pour over 300 ml dry white wine. Cover
the casserole and roast in a 160C oven for 2 to 3 hours.

Makes 4 to 6 servings.
