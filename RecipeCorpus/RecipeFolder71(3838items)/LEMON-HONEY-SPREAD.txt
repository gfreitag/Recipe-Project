4 oz Butter

Finely grated rind and the juice from 4 lemons.(try to avoid the
white part when grating, as this tends to be bitter), and strain the
juice. 4 eggs

Beat the eggs just a little, put all ingredients into a double boiler
or a bowl standing in hot water. Cook slowly until thick, checking
every now and then to make sure all the water in the bottom pan
hasn't boiled away. Should be nice and thick and smooth. Put into HOT
jars, and cover when cold.
