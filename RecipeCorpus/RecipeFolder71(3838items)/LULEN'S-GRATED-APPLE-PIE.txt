Title: LULEN'S GRATED APPLE PIE
Categories: Pies
Yield: 8 Servings
2/3 c  Sugar
1 tb Flour
2 ts Cinnamon
Salt
4 1/2 c  Apples, cored, grated
1    Egg, beaten
1/3 c  Butter, melted
1    Unbaked 9" pie shell
1 c  Chopped pecans (optional)
Filling for LuLen's Beginners' Pie Crust

Preheat oven to 400F.  Mix together the sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt
and apples, then combine with egg and butter. Spoon into pie shell
and sprinkle with pecans. Place on top or upper middle rack of the
oven and bake for 10 min, then lower heat to 350 F and bake for 45-50
min more.

My notes:  Apple skin may be left on if grating is done in a food
processor.  Filling is sufficient for 2 smaller 8" tinfoil pies.
