Categories: Cakes, Breads
Yield: 12 Slices
6 oz Soft light brown sugar
6 oz Butter softened
2 tb Malt extract *

3 oz Wholemeal self raising flour
1 ts Ground cinnamon
8 oz Dried mixed fruit

*Malt extract is a dark syruup available in jars from most health food
shops. It gives a moistness & deliciously malty flavour to cakes. **
To make spice butter, simply beat 1/2 tsp ground mixed spice into
75g/3oz butter Preheat oven to 180C/360F Grease a 2lb loaf tin and
base-line with greased greaseproof paper. Place the brown sugar,
butter and malt extract in a large bowl and beat well until pale &
fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs, 1 Tbsp at a time. Sift the flours
and cinnamon into the creamed mixture (making sure any bran remaining
in the sieve from the wholemeal flour is also tipped into the bowl.)
Using a metal spoon, gently fold in the flours and cinnamon, followed
by the dried fruit. Spoon the mixture into the tin. Bake in the oven
for 1 hr. 10 min. until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out
clean. Cover the top of the cake if it is browning too quickly. Leave
to cool in the tin for 5 min. then turn out on to a cake rack and
allow to cool completely. Sprinkle with sugar and serve with spiced
butter if liked.
