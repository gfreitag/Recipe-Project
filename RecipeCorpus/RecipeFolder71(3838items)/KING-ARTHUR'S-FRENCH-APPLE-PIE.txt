1 c  King Arthur unbleached all-
-purpose flour
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Firm butter
CRUST: Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Put the flour and
salt in a bowl big enough to work in half the
shortening with your pastry blender. Put the remaining
shortening in the blend till it looks mixed, but
lumpy. It's okay to handle the mix at this point, but
once you start to add the ice water, overhandling will
make the crust tough, so try to keep handling to a
minimum. The water should be ice cold and added
gradually, mixing a little with a spoon after each
addition. When dough starts to hold together a bit you
can grab hold of it with your hands to form it into a
ball. Be sure to use plenty of flour on your hands and
on the wooden board, where you'll roll it out.
Transfer the dough to a floured board. Roll the dough
as thinly and evenly as possible. Transfer dough to
pie pan. FILLING: *Recommended apples: Paula Reds are
first choice, or Cortlands Once the apples are
processed they can be mixed with the other
ingredients. If the apples aren't very juicy, you may
want to cut back on the amount of flour a little. Add
cinnamon and nutmeg. TOPPING: Cut the butter with a
knife then mix it with the other ingredients. Mixture
should be a little lumpy. Spread evenly over the top
of the apples. Bake pie in a preheated 425 degree oven
for 15 minutes. then reduce heat to 350 and bake for
an additional 30 minutes.
