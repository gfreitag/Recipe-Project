Title: KATHY PITTS' SANDIA LIQUADO
Categories: Mexican, Fruits, Beverages
Yield: 1 Text file  When we were living in Mexico, I got virtually
addicted to the liquados (freshly-made fruit juices)
they served.  My favorite was Sandia (watermelon).
They made it by placing whole chunks of watermelon
(without the seeds) in a blender, and whirling it
until pulverized, then adding a squeeze of lime juice,
and some water (usually lightly carbonated mineral
water).  No salt or sugar (I watched ;-), but it was
the best, most refreshing drink imaginable. I remember
one night, we sat in a little restaurant in the plaza
of some little town, and (to the everlasting amazement
of our waiter), I drank FIVE beer-scooner-sized
glasses of the stuff.

I've always thought this would also be good as an ice
(either made in one of those little crank-style
freezers you can keep in the refrigerator, or poured
into a freezer tray and stirred occasionally. Never
quite got around to trying to do that one, though.
Maybe this summer.
