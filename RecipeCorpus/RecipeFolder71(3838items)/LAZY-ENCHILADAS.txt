1. Water saute onion,pepper garlic, until onion translucent. 2. Add
spices and let them coat the onion mixture. 3. Add mushrooms and let
cook briefly for 1-2 minutes. 4. Add can of stewed tomatoes and bring
to simmer. 5. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. 6. Add corn and
simmer for 10 more minutes. 7. Add beans and simmer for 5 minutes. 8.
Warm tortillas so they are pliable, and with a slotted spoon scoop
mixture in tortilla, roll, and place on dinner plate.  With
tablespoon, take liquid and pour over tortillas. Repeat until done.

Serves 2 -3 people, depending on side dishes and hunger:)

NOTE: Simmering times are approximate, but you essentially want to
let it cook so the flavors have combined, but not to reduce to a true
stew. It should look a soupy stew, so that you have liquid to put on
tortillas.
