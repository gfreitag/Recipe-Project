2    Bartlett Pears; peeled,

2 tb Dry White Wine
2 tb Light Soy Sauce
1/2 ts Sesame Oil

Place the fish and pears in a glass pie plate. Combine remaining
ingredients except cilantro, lime and water and stir to mix
thoroughly. Pour the mixture over the fish. In a wok, or deep pot,
bring water to a boil. Put the pie plate of fish on a steamer tray,
cover and steam the fish over the simmering water until it's flaky,
about 20 minutes.

Serve the fish and pears on a bed of rice napped with the sauce in the
bottom of the pie plate. Garnish with cilantro leaves and lime wedges.

The choices among fish varieties in Malaysia boggles the mind. In the
U.S. you can successfully repeat this dish using pan-sized trout,
grouper, or other tender fleshed fish.
