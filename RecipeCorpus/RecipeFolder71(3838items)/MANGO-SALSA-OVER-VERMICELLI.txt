Title: MANGO SALSA OVER VERMICELLI
Categories: Appetizers, Pasta, Fruit
Yield: 6 Servings
8 oz Vermicelli or other fine
Strand pasta
1 3/4 c  Diced mangoes
3/4 c  Diced sweet red peppers
1/2 c  Diced red onions
1/2 c  Diced sweet green peppers
3 tb Olive oil
3 tb Lemon juice
2 ts Crushed garlic
1/2 c  Chopped corander or parsley
1.  Cook pasta in boiling water according to package instruction or
until firm to the bite.  Rinse with cold water. Drain and set aside.
2. In bowl of food processor, combine mangoes, and all other
ingrediants.
Process on and off just until finely diced.  Pour over pasta; serve
at room temperature. TIP: Use a ripe sweet mango for a more intense
flavor. If unripe, mangoes are unpleasantly sour.  I have used papaya
instead of mangoes. Make ahead>>> Prepare salsa early in the day and
refrigerate. (This will also allow it to develope more flavor.) Pour
over pasta just before serving.
