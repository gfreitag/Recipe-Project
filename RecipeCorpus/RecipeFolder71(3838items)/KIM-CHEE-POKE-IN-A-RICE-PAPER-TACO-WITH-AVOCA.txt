to water. Add the won bok and soak
for 2 hours. Drain the mixture and add the remaining
kim chee ingredients.
Let stand for 2 hrs.
2. To make the poke: Chop 2 cups of kim chee into fine
pieces and mix with
ahi, onion, shoyu and sesame oil.
3. Make the 'taco' shells. Pour 4 inches of oil into a
deep skillet or pot
and heat until bubbling.Toss in a rice paper sheet.
Use a large metal whisk push the sheet down in the
oil. The rice paper will form itself into
a taco shell around the whisk. Fry 45 to 60 secs.; the
rice paper should be translucent and bubbled. Remove
and drain. Proceed with the rest of the
rice paper.
4. Make the avocado sauce by combining all the
ingredients and whirl in a
blender or processor until smooth. (To keep the sauce
from darkening, place a sheet of plastic wrap directly
on the sauce until needed.) 5. Fill the shells with
the kim chee mixture and serve with avocado sauce.
