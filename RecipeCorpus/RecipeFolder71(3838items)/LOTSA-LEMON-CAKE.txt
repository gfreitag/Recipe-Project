Title: LOTSA LEMON CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 24 Servings
1/2 lb Unsalted butter
2 tb Dried lemon peel
2 c  Sugar
3 tb Lemon juice
pn Salt
4    Eggs
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
3 c  Flour
1 c  Milk
Preheat the oven to 350.  Grease and flour an 9 x 13 pan. In a large
heavy saucepan over medium heat, begin melting the butter. When it is
about half melted, remove from the heat, add the lemon peel, and stir
until the butter is completely melted.  Stir in the sugar, lemon
juice, salt and eggs. Add the baking powder and baking soda in
pinches, breaking up any lumps with your fingers.  Stir thoroughly.
The mixture will foam up. Before it foams too much, stir in the
flour, just until well blended. Stir in the milk until smooth. Pour
and scrape the batter into the pan. Spread evenly and smooth the top.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cake is set and a tester
inserted in the center comes out with just a crumb clinging to it.
Remove from the oven and cool on a rack for 15 minutes. Remove from
the oven and cool on a rack for 15 minutes. Remove from the pan,
invert back onto the rack, and cool to room temperature.
