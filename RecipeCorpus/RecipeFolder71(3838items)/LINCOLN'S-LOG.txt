Heat oven to 375.

1. Beat eggs in small mixer bowl about 5 minutes or until thick and
lemon colored. Gradually beat in granulated sugar. Blend in vanilla
and milk on low speed. Gradually add baking mix, beating just until
batter is smooth.

2. Pour batter into aluminum foil lined jelly roll pan, 15x10x1 inch,
spreading batter to corners.

3. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center
comes out clean. Loosen cake from edges of pan; invert on towel
sprinkled with confectioners' sugar. Carefully remove foil; trim
stiff edges if necessary.

4. While hot, roll cake and towel from narrow end. Cool on wire rack.
Unroll cake and remove towel. Spread cake with Choco-Mint Filling.
Roll up and frost with chocolate frosting, leaving ends unfrosted.
With tines of fork, make strokes in frosting to resemble bark.
Decorate with red cherries and candy spearmint leaves. Refrigerate. 8
to 12 servings.

CHOCO-MINT FILLING

Blend 1/2 can (18-oz) Betty Crocker chocolate fudge pudding and 1/2
tsp peppermint extract.

Or, it can go Irish with a Grasshopper Filling:

Combine marshmallows and milk in saucepan. Cook over medium heat,
stirring constantly, just until marshmallows are melted. Chill until
thickened. Blend in liquers. Prepare topping mix as directed on
package. Fold in marshmallow mixture.

Spread cake with filling, roll up and chill til set, at least 4
hours. Just before serving, sprinkle with confectioners sugar.
