(I use a Donvier.) I find that adults like this flavor and today's
kids hate it. I used to use an egg in it, till the salmonella and
cholesterol scares. I find I don't miss it.

When you make it, think of my poor grandmother, in the 1920's heating
up a goatsmilk lemon custard, trying hard to keep it from curdling,
hand-chopping the mint, and then turning the ice cream maker over to
4 sons to crank. She was an ex-missionary nurse and a heck of lady,
named Flossie Pease.
