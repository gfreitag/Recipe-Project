Crepe Batter:

1.  Make crepe batter:  whisk egg and milk lightly together in medium
mixing bowl. Add flour, sugar, lemon zest, and salt and whisk until
smooth. Refrigerate covered at least 2 hours or overnight. 2. One
hour before serving, make lemon sauce:  heat water and sugar in heavy
medium saucepan until sugar dissolves. Add lemon slices and simmer 30
minutes. Cool to room temperature. 3. Make crepes: coat crepe pan on
6-inch nonstick skillet with thin layerof butter or oil. Heat pan
over medium-high heat. Pour in 2 tablespoons of the crepe batter and
quickly tilt pan to spread batter evenly.  Cook until bottom is
golden and edge has pulled away from side of pan, about 3 minutes.
Turn crepe and cook second side about 1 minute. Let cool on plate and
repeat with remaining batter to make 8 crepes in all. (Crepes can be
cooked in advance and refrigerated or frozen, tightly wrapped.  Warm
in 300 degree oven before serving.) 4. Just before serving, make
cream filling:  beat cream, sugar, and vanilla in mixer bowl until
stiff peaks form. 5. Place 2 crepes, golden side down, on each
dessert plate.  Spoon cream filling onto each crepe and roll up,
folding in edges and placing seam side down on plates. Pour 1/4 cup
lemon sauce over each serving, and serve at once.
