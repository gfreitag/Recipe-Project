1/2 ts Black pepper
2 md Onions, chopped
5 lg Garlic coves, minced
2 lg Red bell peppers, chopped

Place each loaf of bread dough in a separate bowl. Add 1 Tbsp. of oil
to each bowl, season each with 1/4 tsp pepper. Knead each in the bowl
until the oil is well incorporated, about 3 minutes. Let dough rest
in the bowl for 10 minutes.

Oil two baking sheets.  Turn out dough on to a floured surface and
knead 1 minute.  Roll out with a floured rolling pin into an
irregular rectangle, pulling and stretching the dough as necessary.
Transfer to a prepared sheet and brush with 1 Tbsp. of oil.  Let
dough rise uncovered in a warm draft-free spot about
30    minutes (until puffy).

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Heat 3 Tbsp. of oil in a large
skillet. Add the onions and garlic, saute for 1 minute. Add bell
peppers and chard ribs and saute until tender, about 10 minutes. Add
chard leaves and saute until wilted (about 3 minute) and coated with
oil. Season with salt & pepper.

Make indentations all over the dough with your fingers. Brush with
olive oil.  Spread vegetables over the dough leaving a 1" border.
Bake until golden about 25 minutes. Serve warm or room temperature.
