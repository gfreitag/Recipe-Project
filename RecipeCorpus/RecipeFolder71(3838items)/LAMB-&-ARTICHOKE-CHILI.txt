Title: LAMB & ARTICHOKE CHILI
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2    Recipe chili base
-(See RECIPE)-
1    Lemon
4 lg Artichokes
1 lb Boneless lamb shoulder
- cut into 1/2-in strips
2 tb Finely minced garlic
1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
1 c  Chicken stock
-=OR=- Low-sodium broth
Salt; as desired
1/2 bn Cilantro leaves; chopped
12    Corn tortillas
1 c  Sour cream
PREPARE OR DEFROST the chili base. Combine water and the juice of 1
lemon in a 2-quart pot. Keep the lemon for rubbing the cut surfaces
of the artichokes as you work. Cut the stems off the artichoke. Trim
the tops, leaving a base about 1 1/2-inches deep and exposing the
center choke. Trim all around the sides and bottom to remove the dark
green exterior. Place bottoms in the water as they are done. When the
4 artichokes are trimmed, bring the water to a boil, covered, over
high heat and cook for 20 minutes, or until bottoms are tender.
Remove from heat and remove artichokes from the liquid. When cool
enough to handle, scoop out center chokes and discard. If not using
artichokes immediately, replace in cooking liquid and keep in
refrigerator. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a Dutch oven or deep
ovenproof skillet over high heat on the stove. Add the lamb and
saute, stirring, 5 minutes. Reduce the heat, add the artichokes and
garlic and cook another 5 minutes. Add the chili base, lime juice and
stock. Cover and place in oven for 1 hour. Taste for salt. Arrange
the chili in a covered dish, or serve individually in bowls and
sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Serve warm tortillas instead of bread
and pass sour cream on the side.
