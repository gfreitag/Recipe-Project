golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Add the garlic, garam masala and
cayenne, lower the heat to medium-high, and saute for another 2
minutes. Stir in the ground spices and saute another 2 minutes,

about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste mixture and cardamom seeds and
stir well. Lower heat, cover pan tightly, and simmer about 30
minutes, stirring occasionally and adding more water by tsp if sauce
starts to stick to the pan. Uncover the pan and stir in the lemon
juice and salt. Simmer uncovered about 10 minutes longer, stirring
frequently, until the meat is tender and the sauce is very thick.
Makes 3-4 Servings.
