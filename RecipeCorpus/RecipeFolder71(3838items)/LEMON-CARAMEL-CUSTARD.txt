Title: LEMON CARAMEL CUSTARD
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 pn Cream of tartar
3 1/2 c  Milk
1 c  Heavy cream
5 lg Eggs
5 lg Egg yolks
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Lemon zest
1 ts Vanilla
In a small heavy saucepan, combine 3/4 cup of sugar, cream of tartar,
and 1/4 cup water. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the
sugar is dissolved. Boil the syrup, covered, for 1 minute. Remove the
lid and boil the syrup, undisturbed, until it begins to turn golden.
Continue to boil the syrup, swirling it and tilting the pan, until it
is deep golden caramel. Pour the caramel into a 9x5 loaf pan, tilt
the pan to coat the bottom and sides, and let it cool.

In a large saucepan, scald the milk with the cream over moderate heat.
In a large heatproof bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, egg yolks
, and the remaining sugar, until the mixture is light and frothy. Add
the scalded milk in a slow stream, stirring constantly, and stir in
the lemon juice, zest, and vanilla.  Set the pan in a larger deeper
baking pan and strain the custard mixture into the loaf pan. Cover
the loaf pan with heavy-duty foil and add enough hot water to the
larger pan so that it reaches 2/3 of the way up the outside of the
loaf pan.

Bake the custard in the middle of a preheated 325f oven for 80
minutes. Remove the loaf pan from the larger one and remove the foil.
(The custard will not appear set in the middle but it will set as it
cools.)

Let the custard cool and then chill it, covered, overnight. Run a thin
knife around the edge of the custard, invert a serving plate over it
and invert the custard onto the plate.
