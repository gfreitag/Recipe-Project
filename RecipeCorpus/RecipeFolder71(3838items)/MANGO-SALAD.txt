A most unusual and provocative taste combination of sweet-hot
ingredients, Mango Salad was a weekly Favorite Recipe contest winner
in June 1988. To prepare mangos, cut a slice off each end.  Stand
mango on the larger flat end and cut the peel from top to bottom, in
a curve, with a sharp knife. Cut flesh away from the flat oval seed,
using the same technique: slice from top to bottom in a curve on
either side of seed. Cut remaining mango from the sides, but don't
cut too close to seed. Slice mango flesh or cut into chunks. Combine
mango, onion and jalapeno in a medium-size bowl. In another bowl,
combine oil, vinegar, salt, black pepper and sugar, stirring to make
dressing. Add dressing to mango mixture and let stand 2 hours or more
before serving.  Makes about 8 servings. ** Houston Chronicle 4/17/96
