Combine marinade ingredients and soak ribs for 1-2
hours. Place on cold broiler pan; broil on middle rack
position 10-12 minutes on each side or until of
desired doneness.

Be heavy handed on the garlic and ginger if you
like. Get the butcher to slice the short ribs very
thin 1/4" or less. And broil over coals. This and
steak teriyaki is a favorite island picknic item.
