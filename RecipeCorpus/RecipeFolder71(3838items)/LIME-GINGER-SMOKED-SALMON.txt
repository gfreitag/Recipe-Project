about three-quarters full of hardwood charcoal and heat coals. Arrange
twigs over hot coals. Fill water pan about three-quarters full with
hot water.  Add apple juice and ginger to water pan and place pan in
smoker as aromatic.
Unwrap salmon and place on sprayed grid.  cover quickly. smoke
salmon about 3 hours or until fish flakes easily when prodded with
fork. Skin will turn a smoky color.
While smoking, remember not to remove lid of smoker more than is
necessary because it allows heat and moisture to escape, which slows
the smoking process. also, while using smoker, check every 30 minutes
to see if hot water or coals have to be replenished. Be careful and
use pot holders.
Serve fish warm or cold with hot rice.

NOTE:  A perfect way to store fresh ginger is to peel it, place it in
a small jar, cover it with sherry, and refrigerate. The sherry adds
flavor and body to the taste of the ginger.
