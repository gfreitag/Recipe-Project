Cut the aubergine into 1 cm dice. Halve the courgettes lengthways then
slice into thick half-moons. Deseed the bell peppers and cut into 1 cm
squares.

Put the tomatoes in a large pan and crush with a potato masher. Add
the vegetables, herbs, chilli powder and seasoning. Bring to the
boil, cover and simmer 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Layer the
sauce and lasagne pieces in a casserole dish, beginning and ending
with a layer of vegetables. Pour over the water to moisten. Bake,
covered, at 190 C (375 F, Gas 5) for 45-50 minutes and serve with a
green salad.
