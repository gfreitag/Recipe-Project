Title: LEMON FUDGE TART
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 2 Tarts
6 oz Plain White Flour
Icing sugar
9 1/2 oz Butter
5    Lemons
10    Eggs
10 oz Caster Sugar
Blend together the flour, 1 level tablespoon of icing sugar, and 3.5
ounces butter in a food processor until the mixture resembles
breadcrumbs. divide between two 22cm ceramic flan dishes and press
into the base using your fingertips.

Bake at 170C/325F/Gas Mark 3 for about 35-40 minutes or until golden.

Melt the remaining butter for the filling and place in a processor
with the grated rind and squeezed juice of the lemons (about 7 fl
oz), the eggs and caster sugar. Blend until smooth, then pour over
the warm shortbread (the bases must be warm when the filling is put
in or the crumbs will rise to the surface.)

Bake at 130C/250F/Gas mark one-half for 75 to 90 minutes or until
just set (the slower the cooking time the smoother the texture),
Leave to cool then cover and refrigerate for up to 4 days.

To serve, remove from the fridge for 1 hour. Cut into wedges, ease
out of the dishes and dust heavily with icing sugar. Return to fridge
until required.
