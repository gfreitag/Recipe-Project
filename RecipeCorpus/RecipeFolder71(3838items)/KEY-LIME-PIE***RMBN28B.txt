Categories: Pies, Fruits, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 cn (14 0unces) sweetened conden
4 ea Egg yolks
1/3 ea To 1/2 cup bottled key lime
1 ea Unbaked 9" graham cracker pi
1 x  Whipped cream for garnish
This is mighty tasty and quite easy to make: Pre-heat
oven to 325. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together
sweetened con. milk and egg yolks until well-blended.
Slowly stir in the lime juice ( for more tart flavor,
use 1/2 cup juice), stirring gently just until
blended. Pour into pie crust and bake for 10 minutes.
Allow to cool at room temperature, then chill before
serving. Top with whip cream, if desired...I think
it's best with the whipped cream. Note: This recipe
leaves room in the crust for whipped cream. If more
filling is desired, increase the filling proportions
by 1/2.
