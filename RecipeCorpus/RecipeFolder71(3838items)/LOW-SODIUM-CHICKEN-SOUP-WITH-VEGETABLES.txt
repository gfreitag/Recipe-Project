Categories: Poultry
Yield: 8 Servings
3 lb Frying chicken -- skinned &
Cut up
1/2 c  Dry sherry
1/2 c  Chopped green onions
2 c  Chopped tomatoes
1 c  Corn kernels
1/2 c  Diced sweet potatoes
1/2 c  Shelled peas

1/2 ts Minced fresh tarragon
1 sm Jalapeno chile (optional) --

1. In a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, sear
chicken pieces in sherry by sauteing rapidly on both sides until
browned (about 10 minutes). Remove from pot and set aside.

2. Add green onions, tomatoes, corn, and sweet potatoes, and saute
for 5 minutes in cooking liquid left in stockpot. If pot becomes dry,
add a small amount of water.

3. Add peas, chives, basil, tarragon, and chile and cook 5 minutes.
Add stock, the water, and chicken pieces. Bring to a boil, then lower
heat to medium, cover pot, and cook for 45 minutes.

Note: For an even tastier soup, make this recipe the night before, let
cool, and then refrigerate overnight. The rich aroma and flavor of the
herbs will intensify.
