Title: LENTIL & GREENS KHORESHE
Categories: Main dish, Vegan
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lg Onion; finely chopped
1/3 c  Oil
1 ts Turmeric
2 1/2 c  Water
1/4 c  Lemon or lime juice
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
8    Green onions; chopped
1/2 lb Spinach leaves
-- coarsely chopped
1/4 lb Fresh parsley; chopped
2 oz Fresh cilantro; chopped
2 oz Tareh; chopped
-OR chopped garlic chives
1 c  Brown lentils; rinsed
A 'khoreshe' is a sauce-like main dish, to be served with rice.
'Tareh' resembles leeks, but much smaller, and has a garlic flavor.

In a heavy pan, brown the onion in oil over medium heat, stirring
frequently.  Add turmeric and fry for another minute or so.  Add
remaining ingredients, stir, and cover.  Decrease heat to low and let
simmer until lentils are tender, about 40 minutes.  Adjust seasonings
if necessary and serve khoreshe with the best quality of rice you can
obtain; basmati is what I recommend.  Wholemeal flatbread is nice
also, especially for dipping into the khoreshe.

Variation: Substitute 1/2 pound of fresh or frozen fava beans for the
lentils.  Decrease water to 1-1/2 cups.
