Title: KOTONJATA (CHRISTMAS CANDY)
Categories: Candies, Fruits, Desserts
Yield: 1 Batch
13 lg Quince
2    Lemons
2 c  Water
Sugar
1 c  Lemon juice; strained
Select desired number of even colored (not spotted)
quince.  I use 13 large quince.  Wash and peel as you
would an apple.  Use a shredder and grate on largest
holes.  Place all meat in a heavy pot with juice of 2
lemons and 2 cups of water.  Cook over lowest flame
for at least an hour or an hour and a half.  Test to
see if quince is soft. Remove from fire. Measure the
cooked quince by cup and return to pot. Add equal
number of quince and sugar in the same pot.  Stir well
until blended. Cook on medium heat, watching carefully
that it doesn't scorch. Reduce heat to lowest setting
for an hour, stirring frequently. After first half
hour add 1 cup strained lemon juice. Test quince by
placing a teaspoonful on a small plate. If it doesn't
run, it's ready to pour on platters or in Pyrex
bakiing dish about 1/4 inch thick.  Let dry for 3
days, turning frequently. Cut in smaller pieces to
help turn easier.  When hardened, wrap and refrigerate
until used.
