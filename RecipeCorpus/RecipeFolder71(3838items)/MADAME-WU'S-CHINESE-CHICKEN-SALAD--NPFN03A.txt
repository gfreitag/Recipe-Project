Title: MADAME WU'S CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD  NPFN03A
Categories: Chinese, Chicken, Salads
2    Whole chicken breasts
Yield: 8 Servings
1 ts Sesame oil
Oil for deep frying in wok
:
1 ts Five Spice Powder*
12    Squares won ton skins --
slice
:
1/2 c  Sliced green onion (1
bunch)
:
2 oz Rice noodles
1/4 c  Chopped toasted almonds
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1    Head lettuce -- shredded
1 TB Prepared mustard

Steam chicken breasts or cook in micro until barely done; skin, bone
and shred (this is easy if you used 2 forks). In medium sized bowl,
mix soy sauce, mustard, oil and Five SpicePowder (available in Asian
food sections of most super markets - at least in California) and
green onions; marinade chicken in this sauce, covered. Heat oil VERY
hot (drop a piece of won ton skin in - if it floats right back up,
oil is hot enough). Fry won ton skins until just beginning to turn
golden; remove with slotted spoon to drain on paper towels (they will
continue to brown when removed from heat). Fry noodles, a very few at
a time, in hot oil - they will puff up almost immediately. Remove and
drain immediately (they will be white). When ready to eat, slice
lettuce (reserve some whole leaves to garnish bowl) thinly, add
chicken and marinade, fried won ton skins and fried noodles (crumble
a little as you add them), and almonds. Serve from large bowl ringed
with whole lettuce leaves. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.00
