Title: LYONNAISE SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Butter
2 lg Onions, Chopped
1/2 c  Dry White Wine
1 c  Basic Brown Sauce (See
-Sauces)
1 tb Chopped Fresh Parsley
Onions play a large part in the hearty cooking of the region of Lyon,
France.  This sauce incorporates the sweetness of fresh onions in a
base of brown sauce, and is really an all-around accompaniment. Try
it on eggs, over cooked vegetables, with cold roast meats, grilled
chops----nearly everything that's full flavored.

Melt the butter in a medium-size heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add
the onions and saute gently until golden, about 10 minutes. Stir in
the wine and cook over high heat until the liquid is reduced by half.
Pour in the brown sauce and simmer over low heat for 15 minutes. Add
the parsley, cook 1 minute longer, and serve immediately.

Yield:  About 2 cups of sauce.
