Title: KATHY PITTS' TURKEY & CHEESE SANDWICH
Categories: Breads, Poultry, Cheese
Yield: 1 Sandwich
2 sl Whole grain bread
1/2    Ripe avocado, sliced
sl Smoked Monterey Jack or
-smoked Gouda cheese
Alfalfa sprouts
Radish sprouts
sl Very ripe tomato
Olive oil
Wine vinegar
Fresh ground black pepper
Here's one I invented a lot of years ago for a
vegetarian friend. Not low fat, but it is good (what
can I say, I'm originally from California).

Lay the bread slices on a flat surface.  Put half the
avocado slices on each bread half.  Top one bread half
with the remaining ingredients, dressing this mess
VERY LIGHTLY with oil and vinegar. Top with remaining
avocado/bread half, and cut into quarters to serve.

For a non-vegetarian version of this, I've added thin
slices of smoked turkey.

I've also made this by piling the whole mess into
halves of pita bread, but if you can get good
whole-grain bread, that's even better.
