Categories:
Yield: 40 Servings
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/3 c  Slivered almonds -- chopped
And toasted
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
3/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Vegetable oil
2    Eggs
3 tb Minced lemon rind
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice

1    Egg white -- lightly beaten
Combine flour and next 3 ingredients, and set aside. Combine sugar,
oil, and eggs in a large bowl; beat at high speed of an electric
mixer until thick and pale (about 5 minutes). Add lemon rind and
lemon juice, and beat until well blended. Stir in flour mixture until
well blended.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and divide dough into 2
equal portions. Shape each portion into an 11-inch-long roll. Place
cookie rolls about 2 inches apart on a large baking sheet coated with
cooking spray, and flatten each roll to an 1-inch thickness. Brush
rolls with egg white.

Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Remove rolls from baking sheet to
a wire rack, and let cool. Slice each roll diagonally into 20
(1/2-inch) slices. Place slices on baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees
for 20 minutes or until dry. Cool completely on wire racks. Yield: 40
cookies (serving size: 1 cookie).
