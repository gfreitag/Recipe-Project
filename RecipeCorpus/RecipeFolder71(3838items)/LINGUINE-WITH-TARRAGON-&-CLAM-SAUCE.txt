Title: LINGUINE WITH TARRAGON & CLAM SAUCE
Categories: Italian, Pasta, Seafood, Sauces
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Recipe Egg Pasta (OR 3/4 Lb
-dry linguine)
2    Cloves garlic
2 tb Fresh tarragon, chopped (2
-tsp dried)
30    Steamers or other small
-clams (about 2 Lbs)
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/8 ts Red-pepper flakes
Salt
Pepper
PREPARATION:  Make the Egg Pasta.  Roll as thin as possible and cut
into 1/8-inch wide strips for linguine. Mince the garlic. Chop the
tarragon. Scrub the clams, discarding any that have opened. Place
clams and wine in a large pot; cook, covered, over medium-high heat,
shaking occasionally, until all the clams have opened, about 6
minutes. Remove pot from heat and allow clams to cool.  Remove clams
from shells; if using steamers, pull off the black portion of the
neck. Swish clams in the cooking liquid to remove any loose sand.
Strain cooking liquid through cheesecloth or a coffee filter.  Chop
clams and put them in a bowl with the strained cooking liquid.  Add 1
tablespoon of the olive oil. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of the
olive oil over low heat in a small saucepan. Add the garlic and cook
until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the tarragon and red-pepper flakes
and cook for 2 minutes more. Add the clams and cooking liquid, bring
to a simmer, and remove saucepan from the heat. Season with salt and
pepper.  NOTE:  Recipe can be made to this point several hours ahead.

COOKING AND SERVING:  Cook the pasta in boiling, salted water until
tender, about 3 minutes for fresh pasta. Meanwhile, reheat the clam
sauce if made ahead.  Drain the pasta and return to the pot.  Toss
linguine with the clam sauce and adjust the seasoning, if desired.
Serve immediately.

Makes 4 servings.
