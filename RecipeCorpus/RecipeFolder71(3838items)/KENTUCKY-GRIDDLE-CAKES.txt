Title: KENTUCKY GRIDDLE CAKES
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Yellow Cornmeal
1/2 c  All Purpose Flour
1 ts Sugar
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Baking Soda
1 c  Buttermilk
1 lg Egg
2 tb Vegetable Oil
1 c  Maple Syrup, Warmed
Mix the cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, baking powder
and baking soda in a medium size bowl. Combine the
buttermilk, egg and oil in a small bowl. Stir the
buttermilk mixture into the cornmeal mixture just
until well blended (the batter will still be slightly
lumpy). Lightly oil the griddle or large frying pan.
Heat over medium high heat until a drop of water will
dance across the surface. Stir the batter and drop a
test cake ( 1/4 cup of batter) on the griddle. Cook
until the bubbles burst on the top surface and the
bottom is light brown. Turn and cook the other side
until it is browned (1-2 minutes). (Add more
buttermilk to the batter if the first cake does not
spread well.) Serve the griddle cakes with the warm
syrup.
