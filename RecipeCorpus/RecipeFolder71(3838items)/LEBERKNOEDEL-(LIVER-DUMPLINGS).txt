Title: LEBERKNOEDEL (LIVER DUMPLINGS)
Categories: Soups/stews, German
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Chopped, stale kaiser-type
-rolls
1    Onion, finely chopped
150 g  Ground liver (5 oz)
A little scraped spleen
-(optional)
2 tb Marjoram*
1    Egg
1/8 l  Milk (1/2 cup plus 1/2 Tbsp)
Salt
Pepper
Ground nutmeg
[small] bunch
1
-parsley, chopped
A little bit grated lemon
-peel
A little butter for sauteing
Soak the rolls in lukewarm milk.  Saute the onion and parsley in
butter, then add - along with the other ingredients - to the soaked
rolls and mix well into a firm mass. If the mixture is too loose, add
a bit of plain breadcrumbs.  Shape into dumplings, put into barely
boiling water, and let steep for 25 minutes. Transfer to clear beef
broth and serve.

Serves 4.

[*Note:  Based on the amount, I would imagine this is fresh marjoram.
