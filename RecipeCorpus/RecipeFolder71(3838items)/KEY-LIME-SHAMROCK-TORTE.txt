Title: KEY LIME SHAMROCK TORTE
Categories: Desserts, Vegetarian, Cakes
Yield: 6 Servings
2 pk Firm silken tofu
3/4 c  Brown rice syrup
1/2 c  Honey
3/4 c  Lime juice
1 tb Agar powder
4 tb Arrowroot
2 tb Corn oil
1 ea Carob cake, see recipe
2 ea Kiwi fruits
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
1 ts Agar powder
1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Brown rice syrup
2 dr Mint extract
Blend the tofu, brown rice syrup, honey, lime juice,
agar, arrowroot & corn oil until smooth.  Transfer to
a double boiler & heat till the mixture thickens.  It
should reach the consistency of heavy cream.  Set
aside to cool.

Split the carob cake into 2 layers (you'll need only 1
layer).  Line a 9-inch cake pan with a sheet of
plastic wrap.  Place one layer of cake in the bottom
of the pan & refrigerate while the filling is cooling.

When the filling is cool, pour it into the cake &
refrigerate until the filling sets completely (about 2
hours).

Peel the kiwi fruit, cut it into thin slices & fan out
the slices over the entire torte.  Glaze if desired by
pouring a thin layer of still warm glaze over the cool
cake.  Refrigerate the cake again for 10 minutes
before cutting it.

To serve, remove the cake from the pan by lifting out
on the plastic wrap.

GLAZE: In a small pot, dissolve the agar in the water.
Add brown rice syrup & mint extract.  Bring to a
simmer & remove from heat.  Allow to cool slightly.
