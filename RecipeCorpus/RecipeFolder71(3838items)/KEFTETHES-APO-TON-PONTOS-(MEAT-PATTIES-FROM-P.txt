Finely grind veal and pork, leaving some fat on pork.
Combine meats.

Soak bread in cold water.  Squeeze dry and crumble
into a mixing bowl. Add onion, garlic, herbs, tomato,
egg and vinegar; blend in soda, salt and pepper.  Add
meat and blend in lightly and thoroughly, using a hand
if necessary.  Chill for 1 hour.

Taking about 2 tablespoons of the mixture at a time,
roll into balls. Moisten hands occasionally.  Roll
balls in flour and flatten into rounds 5 cm (2 inches)

each side.  Patties will puff up.  Turn carefully with
spatula or tongs.  Drain on paper towels and serve
immediately with fried potatoes and vegetables or
salad.
