Title: LEEKS IN RED WINE
Categories: Side dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Olive oil
3 lb Small leeks, cleaned &
-- trimmed
1 c  Dry red wine
1/2 c  Vegetable broth
Heat oil in a large skillet: the skillet must be large enough to hold
the leeks in a single layer.  Add leeks & saute until lightly browned
on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add a little wine or broth if they
stick.

Add the remaining wine & broth & bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat &
simer for 10 minutes, turning the leeks once during this time.

Transfer leeks to a serving dish.  Cook sauce a few minutes more to
reduce & then pour over the leeks & serve. This is good hot, tepid or
cold.
