Title: LECHE QUEMADA - BURNT MILK CANDY
Categories: Mexican, Candies
Yield: 1 Batch
1 qt Milk;
-(I use FF powdered milk,
- doubling the amount of
- powder per quantity of
- water)
2 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
Put everything to boil, and when boiling simmer. Mix often. Leave
like this many hours, the color will change, first yellow, than light
brown and at the caramel color (the one that interests us). Remove
from stove, add vanilla, mix so as not to get a skin. Takes a little
more than 2 hours.
