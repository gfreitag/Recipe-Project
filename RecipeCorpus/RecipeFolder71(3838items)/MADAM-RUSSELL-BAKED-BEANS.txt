Title: MADAM RUSSELL BAKED BEANS
Categories: Beans
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Dried white pea beans
1 md Onion -- diced
1/2 c  Molasses
1/2 ts Dry mustard
1/4 c  Brown sugar -- packed
1 ts Salt
1/4 lb Salt pork -- lean, diced
Pick over beans and rinse.  Place in a large bowl; add water to
cover. Let stand overnight; drain.  Combine beans and onions in a
large saucepan; add water to cover; heat to boiling; cover. Simmer 45
minutes, or until skins of beans burst when you blow on several in a
spoon. Drain liquid into a small bowl.  Measure 1 cup of the bean
liquid and combine with molasses, mustard, brown sugar, and salt in a
bowl. Layer half of the salt pork and all of the beans into an 8 cup
bean pot. Pour molasses mixture overtop; add just enough more saved
liquid to cover beans. Top with remaining salt pork, pressing down
into liquid; cover.  Bake at 300F 4 hours; uncover. Bake 1 hour
longer, or until beans are deep brown, tender, and as dry as you like
them. (After 2 hours baking, check beans, and if they seem dry, add
more saved bean liquid to keep them moist.)
