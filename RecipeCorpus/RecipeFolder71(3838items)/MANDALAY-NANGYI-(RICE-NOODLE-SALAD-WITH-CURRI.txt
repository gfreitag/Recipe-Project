paprika over moderate heat for 2 minutes.

3.  Add the onion and game hen and brown well for about 10 minutes.
Add the tomato and stir fry for 2 minutes more. Lastly add the water,
cover the pan, and cook for 30 minutes, or until the hen is tender.

4.  Cool the curry.  Remove all the meat from the bones, cut into
cubes, and mix with the remaining curry sauce. Slice the giblets.

5.  In a large dish, cover the noodles with boiling water and let
stand for 15 minutes.  Drain well and set aside.

6.  Each person helps himself, putting the food on his plate in the
following order:  first a generous helping of rice noodles and a
heaping tablespoon of the hen and sauce. Then sprinkle over that 1 or
2 teaspoons of 'besan', several slices of onion, scallion, coriander,
2 or 3 teaspoons fish sauce, and a pinch of the hot chili flakes.
Each diner mixes his own salad on his plate and squeezes lime juice
over all.

Eat at room temperature and help yourself to seconds, mixed to taste.

Variation:

The curried hen can also be served on its own with plain rice.
