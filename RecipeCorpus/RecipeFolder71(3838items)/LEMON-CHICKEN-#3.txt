Title: LEMON CHICKEN #3
Categories: Chinese, Chicken
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Whole chicken breasts
1/3 c  Water chestnut powder
1/3 c  Lemon sauce
5 c  Vegetable oil
1 tb Water
1/2 tb Sugar
Cornstarch paste
This is one of the most appealing and unique recipes in Chinese cook-
ing that goes by this name.

Preparation:  Pull chicken skin from breasts, then carefully pull
meat from breast bone, keeping meat intact. Thin inner filet will
come off separately. Cut meat across the grain into strips about 3/4"
wide by 1 1/2" long.  Put water chestnut powder in bowl large enough
to hold chicken, & deep enough to keep powder from flying around. Add
chicken pieces a few at a time, tossing gently to thoroughly coat
each piece; they should be entirely white.  Leave them in bowl while
you prepare sauce.

Sauce:  In small saucepan, mix prepared lemon sauce (we suggest Mee
Chun brand from Hong Kong), water & sugar. Bring to boil; reduce heat
& simmer for 2 minutes. Just before serving, thicken with cornstarch
paste to consistency of a fudge sauce.

Deep-frying:  In deep-fryer or wok, slowly heat oil to deep-frying
temperature.  (Don't let oil smoke.)  Test with piece of chicken: it
should reach a medium brown in about 35 seconds. Fry chicken in
batches of 5-6 pieces at a time; drain.  Place on serving plate,
keeping warm until ready to serve.  Pour lemon sauce over chicken at
last minute.
