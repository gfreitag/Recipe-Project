3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour or
Unbleached flour
1 ts Salt
1 c  Butter or margarine
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 c  ;warm water (105 degrees F.

1    Egg; beaten
1 ts Lemon rind; grated

Mix together flour and salt.  Cut in butter.  Dissolve yeast in
water. Set aside for 5 minutes until bubbly.  Add yeast, yogurt, egg
and rind to flour, mixing well.  Dough will be somewhat sticky. Wrap
in wax paper and chill for about 2 hours.

Roll half the dough on a lightly sugared board into an 8x16-inch
rectangle. Fold ends toward center, overlapping.  Sprinkle with
sugar. Roll again to same size and repeat.  Repeat a third time,
ending in the rectangle. Cut into 1x4-inch strips.  Sprinkle with
nutmeg. Twist ends into opposite directions, stretching slightly.
Place on lightly greased cookie sheets or bend into the shape of a
horseshoe. Bake at 375 degrees F. for 10 to 15 minutes or until
lightly browned.

Tips: Plain yogurt can be substituted.  The dough can be chilled
overnight if more convenient.  Add 1 cup currants to the dough and
sprinkle with nutmeg and cinnamon sugar for variety.
