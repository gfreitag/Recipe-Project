Title: LA PARILLA NORTENO-STYLE ARBOL CHILE SALSA
Categories: Mexican, Salsas
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Corn oil
6    Arbol chiles -- with seeds
8    Tomatillos -- husked
1 sm Clove garlic -- minced
1 tb Fresh cilantro -- coarsely
Chopped
1/2 c  Water
1/3 c  White onion -- finely diced
1/8 ts Kosher salt
1/8 ts Mexican oregano -- toasted
And ground
1/8 ts Cumin -- toasted
In northern Mexico and south Texas, this brick-red salsa is slathered
over all kinds of meats and cheeses. In fact, this style of salsa
became so popular that variations (like Tabasco sauce) are bottled
for sale worldwide. Try this version for its complex and cleansing
heat.

Heat the corn oil in a medium-sized skillet over medium-high heat
until hot but not smoking. Fry the chiles, 1 or 2 at a time, until
puffed and brown, about 10 seconds. Do not burn or they will taste
bitter. Shake off excess oil from chiles and place in a food
processor.

Put the tomatillos in a small saucepan, cover with water, and place
over high heat. Bring to a boil, lower heat to a simmer, and cook
until tender, about 10 minutes. The tomatillos will have changed
color and be soft but still whole.

Add the tomatillos to the food processor along with the garlic.
Process until finely chopped. Add the cilantro and water and continue
to process until smooth. Add the onion, salt, oregano, and cumin and
pulse to mix. Keeps, tightly covered, about 3 days in the
refrigerator.
