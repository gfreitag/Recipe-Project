Cut the chicken breasts into strips about a 1/2 inch wide. Place
them in a bowl and add all of the marinade ingredients: the rice
wine, soy sauce, white pepper and cornstarch. Stir to coat the
chicken pieces with the equally.  Put the bowl in the refrigerator
for an hour or more.

Into a hot wok, pour in about 1 tablespoon of peanut oil, and 1
teaspoon of minced ginger.  Allow the ginger to sizzle for about 30
seconds and then add the marinaded chicken pieces. Stir the chicken
pieces around so they come apart and don't stick together.

Add the zests of lime, lemon, and orange for flavor. Stir for a
minute and then add the wine (allowing it to flame if your kitchen
permits.)

Continue to stir for another minute and add the sauce
ingredients one at a time as you continue to stir and cook until the
chicken is done.

Place the cooked chicken on a bed of cooked white rice and
garnish with lemon, lime, and orange zest. Enjoy!
