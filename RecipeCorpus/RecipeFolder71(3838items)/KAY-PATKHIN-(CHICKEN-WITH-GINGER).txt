Title: KAY PATKHIN (CHICKEN WITH GINGER)
Categories: Laos, Chicken
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Fryer, cut up
Salt to taste
Oil
1    Piece fresh ginger
1    Clove garlic, minced
1 md Onion, sliced
Remove bones, then cut the chicken meat into small
pieces and salt. Fry the chicken meat in a small
amount of oil in a skillet until yellow, gradually
adding hot water until well cooked. Wash and skin the
ginger, then cut into very fine long slim pieces

squeeze salt into the ginger and wash again, removing

in the skillet with chicken, add a small amount of hot
water and heat for 10 minutes before serving. Remove
from heat. Serve hot.
