Categories: Improv, Kohl, Desserts, Fudge
Yield: 1 Cake
4 c  Sugar
1 cn Milk (14 1/2 oz)
1 lg Package (or 2 small)
-chocolate chips
1 pt Marshmallow fluff
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Chopped pecans.
(Variation on other Recipes - This is BEST!)
Mix together sugar, milk and butter. Stir constantly
and boil until the soft ball stage. Test by dropping a
drop or two of the boiling mixture into a small
container of ice cold water. If you can roll it up
into a ball without it melting, then it's soft ball
stage. Remove from heat. Add chocolate chips and stir
until melted. Add the marshmallow fluff and vanilla.
Stir until melted and blended. Add nuts. Pour into a
buttered platter or shallow glass pyrex oblong
casserole dish. Cool, then refrigerate until firm. Cut
into 1-2" squares or whatever size you want.

NOTE: It may take as long as 45 minutes of stirring
and boiling before the soft ball stage is reached. It
depends on the kind of pot (stainless steel or ?) and
range (gas or electric) as to how long it takes.

Be sure to record the time and the exact cooking pot
you used. Then all future preparations of this recipe
or any of the several marshmallow fudge recipes will
be 100% fail-proof!
