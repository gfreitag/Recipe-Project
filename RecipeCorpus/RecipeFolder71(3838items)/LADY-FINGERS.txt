1/2 c  Cake flour -- sifted
2/3 c  Confectioner's sugar --
Sifted
1/8 ts Salt
3    Eggs -- separated
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1.  Preheat oven to moderate (350F)

2.  Sift together three times the flour, half the sugar and the salt.

3.  Beat the egg whites until stiff and gradually beat in the
remaining sugar.  Beat the egg yolks until thick and lemon-colored,

mixture, a third at a time,  over the eggs and fold in carefully.

4.  Line ungreased baking sheets with unglazed paper. Press the batter

5.  Bake twelve to fifteen minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from
paper with a spatula and cool on a rack.
