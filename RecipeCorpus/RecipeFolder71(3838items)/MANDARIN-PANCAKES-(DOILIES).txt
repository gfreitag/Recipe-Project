Title: MANDARIN PANCAKES (DOILIES)
Categories: Chinese, Pancakes
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  All purpose flour
1 c  Boiling water
Sesame oil
Place flour in a mixing bowl.  Gradually stir in boiling water,
mixing with a wooden spoon.  When it is cool enough to handle, knead
with your hands until it is smooth and elastic, adding a little more
flour if necessary. Cover dough with a damp dish towel and let it
rest for 30 minutes. Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface to a
1/4 " thickness. Use a 3 inch round cookie cutter to cut the dough,
rerolling it until all of the dough has been used.  Smear sesame oil
over one side of each 3 inch circle of dough.  Put two circles
together with the sesame-oiled sides touching. Now roll out the dough
circles until they are about 6 inches in diameter, turning as you
roll so they keep a round shape. Cover the pancakes with a damp towel
until you are ready to cook them. Use an ungreased heavy skillet over
low heat and roast one side of the pancake until it bubbles slightly
(about 1 minute). Do not brown. Turn over and roast the other side.
Remove from the skillet and when cool enough to handle pull the two
pancakes apart.  Wrap the pancakes in foil and refrigerate. To
Reheat: Fold each pancake into quarters and place in a steamer. Steam
for 5 minutes. Note: Another method is to place folded pancakes on
top of rice that has just been cooked. The heat and steam from the
rice will reheat them. From: The Chinese Menu Cookbook Shared By: Pat
