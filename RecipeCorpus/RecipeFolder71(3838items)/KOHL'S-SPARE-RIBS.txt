Title: KOHL'S SPARE RIBS
Categories: Improv, Kohl, Meats
Yield: 5 Servings
5 lb Spareribs
1    Bottle catsup ==OR== 1
- 15 oz can tomato sauce
2 tb Brown sugar ==OR== syrup
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
2 tb Flour
1 tb Hot dry mustard
1 tb Chili powder
1 ts Ground cloves
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1 md Can crushed pineapple
Cut ribs into sections of two bones each. Grease a pan
with oil. Mix together catsup, brown sugar, and
Worcestershire sauce. Mix together flour, mustard,
chili powder, cloves, salt and pepper. Combine dry and
liquid mixtures with crushed pineapple. Lay meat in
layers in a pan, with some sauce in between, then top
all with remaining sauce.

Bake at 300 degrees for 1 hour or until done.  Brown
under broiler, turning pieces over to brown both
sides. Watch carefully and do not allow sauce to burn.
In fact, it's best to remove the sauce until ribs are
browned, and then spread it over the ribs after
browning.
