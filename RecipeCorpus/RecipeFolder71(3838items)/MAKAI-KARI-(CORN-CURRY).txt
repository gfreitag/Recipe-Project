"Traditionally made with corn, this dish can also be made with mixed
vegetables." Anne's note: this dish is Tamil (southern Indian in
origin) as shown by the name, "kari" which has been anglicized to
"curry".

In a large heavy-bottomed skillet over low heat, dry roast together
the cashews, peanut, coconut and poppy seeds until the cashews have
brown specks (a few minutes). Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
In the container of a food processor or blender, coarsely chop
together the onion, ginger and garlic. Add the chilli and roasted
cashew mixture and mince well. In a large heavy bottomed skillet,
warm the oil over medium heat. Add the mustard seeds, curry leaves
and sesame seeds. As soon as the mustard seeds sputter, add the
minced onion mixture and saute together until lightly browned (7 to 8
minutes). Whirl the tomato to a puree in the blender. Add to the pan
with the coriander, cumin, black pepper, tumeric, salt and sugar and
cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Add the corn, mix well and cook for 7
minutes. Stir in the diluted yogurt, cover, reduce heat to low and
cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve hot.
