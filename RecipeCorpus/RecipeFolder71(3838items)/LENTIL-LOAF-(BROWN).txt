puree. Stir fry onions in a little oil till soft, throw in the
cayenne & cook for a few more seconds.  Remove lentils from heat &
stir in the remaining ingredients.  Add a little more stock or water
if the mixture is too dry. Season with salt & pepper to taste.

375F/190C for 45 to 50 minutes.  Let stand for 10 minutes & then turn
out on a plate. Serve with vegetables.
