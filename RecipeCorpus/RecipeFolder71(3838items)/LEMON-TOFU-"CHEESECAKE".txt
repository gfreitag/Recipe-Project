Yield: 1 Cake
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
2 c  Grape-Nuts cereal
1/4 c  Maple syrup
1/4 ts Almond extract
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 lb Silken tofu, drained (it
-will say silken on the

1/3 c  Sugar
1 tb Tahini
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Lemon zest
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 ts Almond extract
2 tb Cornstart dissolved in 2
-tb rice or soy milk
Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place cereal in a food
processor or blender; grind to fine crumbs, about 2 minutes. Transfer
to mixing bowl. Add maple syrup and almond extract; mix well until
crumbs are moistened.

Pour into oiled 9-inch pie plate and press mixture evenly on bottom
and up sides to form crust.  Bake 5 minutes; let cool while preparing
filling.

Filling:  Blend all ingredients in food processor or blender until
very smooth, about 30 seconds.

Pour into crust.  Bake until top of pie is slightly browned, about 30
minutes.  Cool and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled and firm,
about 2 hours.  Makes 8 servings.

Variations:
*Alternatively, use a prepared graham cracker crust.
*For a no-bake cheesecake, omit cornstarch mixture. Pour
filling into crust and refrigerate until firm, at least 2
hours or overnight.  The texture will resemble that of a
cream pie.
*Add vanilla-flavored liqueur instead of lemon juice and zest
for a vanilla cheesecake.
*Reduce the sweetener, eliminated the lemon juice and zest,
and add pureed raspberries
*If the fat content doesn't concern you too much, add 12
ounces of melted semisweet chocolate instead of fruit.
*To serve as a pudding, omit the crust and pour the filling
into custard cups.
