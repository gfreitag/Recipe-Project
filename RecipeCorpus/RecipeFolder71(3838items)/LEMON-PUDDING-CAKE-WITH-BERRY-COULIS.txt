1 c  Sugar
1/8 ts Salt
1/4 c  Flour
4 tb Butter; melted
1/2 c  Lemon juice
Grated zest of 1 lemon
3    Eggs; separated
pn Nutmeg
1 1/8 c  Milk
********BERRY COULIS*******
2    1-pt baskets raspberries or
2    10-oz pkg. froz. raspberries
-thawed
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
Sugar to taste
In a mixing bowl, combine 3/4 cup of the sugar, the salt, and the
flour and stir.  Add the melted butter, lemon juice, lemon zest, and
egg yolks. Mix until well blended. Stir in the nutmeg and milk. In a
separate bowl, beat the egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar
until they are stiff but still moist.  Fold into the lemon mixture.

Pour the batter into a buttered 8-inch square baking pan. Set in a
larger pan and pour hot water into the larger pan to come halfway up
the sides of the baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes,
until the top is lightly browned.

While the pudding is baking, prepare the berry coulis. Place the
raspberries, lemon juice, and as much sugar as you wish in the bowl
of a food processor and puree. Strain through a fine sieve, taste,
and adjust the seasoning.

Spoon the pudding cake, warm or cold, into individual plates that
have been lined with the berry coulis. Pass any extra coulis.
