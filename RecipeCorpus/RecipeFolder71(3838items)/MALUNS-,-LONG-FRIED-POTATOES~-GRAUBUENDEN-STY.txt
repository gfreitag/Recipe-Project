Categories: Swiss, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 kg Parboiled potatoes 2 da. old
350 g  Flour
2 ts Salt

Peel the parboiled potatoes and grate them on the coarse side of the
grater.  Sprinkle over them the flour and salt, and stir together
lightly. Heat the butter and stir in the potato-flour mixture. Keep
the heat low and steady, and stir almost constantly until the
potatoes form large "crumbs" and are golden brown. When done, shave
butter over the top before serving. Serve with Milchkaffee (half and
half milk-and-coffee) and applesauce (a sharp or tart one is best).
