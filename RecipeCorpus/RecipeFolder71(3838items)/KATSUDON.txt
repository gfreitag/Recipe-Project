4    Green onions; cut into 1 1/2
-inch lengths
6    Eggs; beaten
Pound the cutlets with a mallet to flatten slightly.
Slash fat at edge of cutlets to keep the meat from
curling during deep frying.  Salt and pepper both
sides. Dust with flour , dip in beaten egg, and coat
both sides thickly with day or fresh breadcrumbs,  Let
rest 2-3 minutes before deep frying. Heat a generous
amount of oil in a heavy bottomed pot or deep-fryewr
to medium temperature(340 degrees), and deep-fry
cutlets on at a time, turning once, till golden brown,
about 6 minutes each.  Remove, drain on absorbent
paper, and cut crosswise into 1/2 inch slices.  Keep
hot. Meanwhile slice onion into rounds or half-moons
and in a large frying pan in a scant amount of oil,
saute onion over high heat till transparent and soft.
Add dashi, miring and soy sauces to the pan.  Bring to
a simmer. Add the green onions.
Finally pour the beaten egg over the simmering onions.
Stir when the egg begins to set.  the egg is done
while stilla little runny and juicy. (Do not cook egg
until hard and dry)  You want the juices to seep sown
in to the rice in the bowl from the egg topping.

To assemble and serve:  Put a single portion of hot
rice (1 1/2-2 cups) into a donburi-type bowl.  Neatly
arrange a slicwed cutlet to cover half the rice.  Use
fried onion and egg topping to cover part of the
cutlet and the rest of the rice.  Use all the liquid.
Serve immediately.
