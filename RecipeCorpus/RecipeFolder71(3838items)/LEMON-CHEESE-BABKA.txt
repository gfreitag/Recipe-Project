1. Sprinkle yeast and 1/2 tsp of the sugar over very warm water in a
1 cup measure.  Stir to dissolve yeast. Let stand until bubbly, about
10 minutes. 2. Combine 2 cups of the flour, salt, lemon rind and the
remaining sugar in a large bowl; make a well in the middle. Beat eggs
and egg yolks in a small bowl just to mix. Pour eggs, yeast mixture
and warm milk into well. Stir liquids into flour until smooth. Beat
well. 3. Add softened butter gradually, beating well.  Stir in 1 more
cup of the flour. Beat until dough leaves the side of the bowl. 4.
Knead on a lightly floured surface; until smooth and elastic, about 8
minutes. 5. Press dough into a buttered large bowl, turn to bring
buttered side up; cover. Let rise in a warm place, 1 1/2 to 2 hours,
or until doubled in volume. 6. While the dough is rising, make Cheese
Filling: Beat cream cheese and cottage cheese in a small bowl with an
electric mixer until smooth; beat in egg yolk and sugar. Stir in
lemon rind. 7. Make Crumb Topping: Combine nuts, flour, butter, sugar
and cinnamon in a small bowl. Grease two 8 x 1 1/2 inch pans. 8. When
dough has doubled, punch down, knead in raisins; divide dough into
four equal parts; press two parts into the bottoms and about 1/2 inch
up the sides of the prepared pans; spread each with about 1 cup of
the cheese filling. 9. Shape remaining dough into 2 8-inch circles;
place on top of cheese filling. Press the handle of a spoon into
dough around edges to seal. 10. Sprinkle half the crumb topping over
each. Let rise in a warm place until dough reaches the top of the
pans, about 1 hour. 11. Bake in a preheated 350 F degree oven for 40
minutes; or until the cakes sound hollow when tapped. Cool on a wire
rack. (Place foil loosely over the crumb topping; invert onto rack,
then turn right side up.) Let cool at least 30 minutes before
serving. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.
