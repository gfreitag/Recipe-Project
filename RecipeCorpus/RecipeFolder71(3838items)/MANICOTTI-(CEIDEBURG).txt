1 c  Creamed cottage cheese
-(8-oz.)

1/2 c  Best Foods Mayonnaise

Here's a bunch of good ol' American recipes, many from Campbell soup
cans or other food packages.  Last might my room mate mentioned that
he'd been typing them in for a while so I immediately grabbed 'em.
This is quite a pot-pourri ranging from Julia Childs French onion
soup to Sloppy Joes to Peanut Butter Cookies. This manicotti one is
excellent!

Brown meat and garlic in skillet.  Drain fat.  Blend next 4
ingredients in bowl, stir in meat.  Fill each manicotti, put in
single layer in 9 x 13-inch pan. Sprinkle with any remaining filling,
cover with sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese over top. Cover with
foil.

Bake at 325F for 15 minutes, remove foil, cook for an additional 10
to 15 minutes or until bubbly.

Serves 4.
