Title: MACARONI & CHEESE .003
Categories: Pasta, Casserole, Cheese/eggs, Posted-bbs
Yield: 1 Recipe
2 tb Butter or margarine
2 tb Flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Dry mustard
2 1/2 c  Milk
3 c  Cheddar cheese; shredded
2 c  Elbow macaroni
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
Paprika
1. Prepare macaroni as directed.

2. In saucepan, melt butter.  Remove from heat, and blend in flour,
salt, and mustard.

3. Add milk gradually.  Heat, stirring constantly (this is important
~- take it from someone who has occasionally gotten lazy about it),
till sauce thickens (it will suddenly appear thicker) and is smooth.

4. Add 2 C cheese.  Heat till melted, stirring occasionally.

5. Drain macaroni, place in large casserole dish (3 quart).

6. Add sauce to casserole dish, stir.

7. Add 1/2 C cheese and 1/4 C bread crumbs.  Stir.

8. Sprinkle 1/2 C cheese on top, then 1/4 C bread crumbs.

9. Sprinkle paprika over top.

10. Bake 20-25 minutes in preheated 375 degree oven.

This can be frozen!  If so, add 5 minutes to cooking time, or thaw
first. This recipe has evolved over the years and in this version
hass received many raves (she humbly said) I think it's the bread
crumbs.
