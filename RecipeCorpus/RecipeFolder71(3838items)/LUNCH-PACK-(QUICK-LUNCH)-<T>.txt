Title: LUNCH PACK (QUICK LUNCH) <T>
Categories: Digest, Sept., Quick
Yield: 1 Servings
None
1-2 cups of cooked rice, half of it wild rice, half of it basmati 1
can of slided water chestnuts 1 salad tomato, chopped

Put into plastice container. Then add:

sliced fresh mushrooms as necessary to fill the container almost to
the rim.

Then dump on top (DO NOT MIX. If you mix it, the rice will be too
soggy come lunch time. Mix before nuking):

1/2 can of Hunts tomato sauce black pepper to taste oregano to taste

At work, when hunger hits, nuke for 3-5 minutes, depending on the
microwave you are using. I like stuff cooked right, so I use 5
minutes to get the tomatoes nice and done.
