To prepare the pesto sauce: Mix all the ingredients by hand in a
mortar or use a food processor. Puree the garlic, most of the pine
nuts and cheese, the basil and oil (add enough oil to produce a light
puree with the consistency of a tomato sauce). Pour the puree into a
small bowl and let it stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour.
Put the potatoes and string beans into a large pot containing 7 pints
(6L) of cold water set over high heat. As soon as the water comes to
a rolling boil, add salt and return to a boil. Cook the linguine al
dente. Meanwhile in a serving bowl, mix the pestowith more oil and
the rest of the pine nuts. Remove the pasta, potatoes and string
beans from the water, drain thoroughly and add to the oil and pesto
mixture. Top with more Parmigiano-Reggiano, mix gently and serve
