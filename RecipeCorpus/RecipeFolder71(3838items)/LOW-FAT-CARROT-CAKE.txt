Yield: 20 Servings
1 c  Unbleached flour
1 c  Whole-grain wheat flour
2 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/2 ts Ground cloves
6    Egg whites
1 1/3 c  Sugar
1 c  Unsweetened applesauce
1/2 c  Buttermilk
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
8 oz Crushed pineapple in juice
Undrained
2 c  Shredded carrots
2/3 c  Walnuts -- chopped
1/2 c  Raisins
1 3/4 c  Low-Fat Cream Cheese
Frosting
Preheat the oven to 350x. Lightly spray a 13" x 9" x 2" baking pan
with non-stick spray.  Set aside. In a large bowl, stir together the
unbleached flour, the whole-grain flour, cinnamon, baking soda,
nutmeg and cloves; set aside. In another large bowl, beat the egg
whites with clean, dry beaters until soft peaks form. Slowly beat in
the sugar. Then slowly beat in the applesauce, buttermilk and vanilla
extract. Using a spoon, stir in the flour mixture just until
combined; do NOT overmix. Then stir in one ingredient at a time ~ the
crushed pineapple, the shredded carrots, the walnuts and the raisins.
Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Bake for about 40 minutes, or
until it tests clean. Cool completely on a wire rack. Meanwhile,
prepare the Low-Fat Cream Cheese Frosting. Spread the frosting on the
cooled cake.
