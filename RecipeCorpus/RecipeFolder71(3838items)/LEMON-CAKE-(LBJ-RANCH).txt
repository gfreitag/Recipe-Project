NOTES : Well, this one led us a merry chase.  A version was posted on
the net, found by a list member to be incomplete. I started looking
for the complete recipe as did the original poster. I found this one
by calling Cyn who called Mrs. Johnson.    The copy I have came in
Lady Bird's envelop e and is on the LBJ ranch note paper. Guess it's
the real McCoy. Senescence begins, and middle age ends The day your
