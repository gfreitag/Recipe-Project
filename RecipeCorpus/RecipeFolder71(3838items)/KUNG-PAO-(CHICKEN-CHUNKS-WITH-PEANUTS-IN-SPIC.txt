Title: KUNG PAO (CHICKEN CHUNKS WITH PEANUTS IN SPIC
Categories: China, Chicken
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Raw peanuts
3 c  Peanut oil
2    Whole chicken breasts at
-room temp.
1 lg Egg white
1 1/2 tb Water chestnut flour
SAUCE:
4    Green onions
2 lg Cloves garlic
1 tb Minced ginger root
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1/2 tb Sesame oil
1/2 tb Chinese red vingear
1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
1 1/2 ts (level) chili paste with
-garlic
1 tb Dry sherry
1 pn Sugar
Cornstarch paste
Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light
green and white part into 1" sections.  Mix all other
sauce ingredients in 2-quart saucepan. Reserve.

Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from
bones. Slice meat into 1" strips, then crosswise to
make 1" chunks. In bowl large enough to hold chicken,
add egg white to water chestnut flour. Beat mixture
with a single chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk).
Stir chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat
thoroughly. Marinate 5 minutes. Note: water chestnut
flour gives a lighter crust than cornstarch, though
the latter may be substituted.

Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to
medium heat (you'll need more oil for deep-fryer). Fry
peanuts until they are a light tan color; if a test
peanut browns quickly, turn down heat. Remove peanuts
with strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel
or paper bag. Reserve.

Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk
first: chicken should raise to surface immediately &
brown in about 2 minutes. Deep-fry coated chicken
chunks until golden brown. Deep-fry no more than 8
chunks at a time.  Use long chopsticks or spatula to
keep pieces separate while they are frying.  Remove
with long chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve.

Sauce:  While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to
simmer. Add green onions & peanuts about a minute
before serving. At the last minute, add chicken pieces
to sauce, mix quickly & serve.
