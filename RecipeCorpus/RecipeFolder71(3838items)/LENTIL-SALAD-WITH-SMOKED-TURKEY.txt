1 c  Lentils; rinsed, picked over
2 c  Chicken stock or broth or
;water
1/4 c  Fresh tarragon or
1 ts Dried tarragon
11 oz Smoked turkey breast

Put lentils and chicken stock in a medium saucepan over medium-high
heat; bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and cook at a slow boil until
the lentils are softened but still firm to the bite, 15 to 20
minutes. Drain the lentils, transfer to a large bowl, and cool to
room temperature.

Mince tarragon leaves and add them, with the turkey breast, red onion,
celery and parsley to the cooked lentils. Mix gently.

Whisk the remaining ingredients together in a small bowl; add to the
lentil mixture.  Mix gently but thoroughly. If desired, chill before
serving.

Loomis writes: "This recipe is another treasure from Li Ochs of
Eureka Farm in eastern Washington.  It's a big, hearty salad, full of
fresh herbs. And with its yogurt-based dressing it manages to be
light and sprightly, too."
