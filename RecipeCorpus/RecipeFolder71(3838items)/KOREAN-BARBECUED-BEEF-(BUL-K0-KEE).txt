Title: KOREAN BARBECUED BEEF (BUL-K0-KEE)
Categories: Ethnic, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Beef-top or sirloin steak
-(boneless)
1/4 c  Soy sauce
2 tb Sesame oil
1/4 ts Pepper
3    Green onion; finely chopped
2    Cloves garlic; minced
2 ts Sugar; or to taste
Trim fat from beef; put in freezer for 45 minutes; cut
beef diagonally across  the  grain  into  1/8  inch
slices; mix remaining ingredients except sugar;  stir
in beef and coat well. Cover and marinate at room
temperature for 2  hours or   overnight   in   the
refrigerator; return to room temperature before
cooking. Add sugar and marinate another 30 minutes.
Stir fry in hot oil using a large skillet or wok over
medium heat until light brown, 2 to 3 minutes, do not
crowd the pan. Serve with hot cooked rice.  Yield 4
servings. Note: Flavor is improved if the beef is
cooked on a bbq grill that has rods close enough
together so the meat will not fall through. 'BULKOKEE'
is Korea's national dish and may have been the
inspiration for Japan's teriyaki, which it resembles.
In Korea, the dish is usually sprinkled with toasted
sesame seeds before serving.
