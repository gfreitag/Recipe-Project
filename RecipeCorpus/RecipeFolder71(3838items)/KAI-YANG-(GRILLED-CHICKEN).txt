Title: KAI YANG (GRILLED CHICKEN)
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Whole chicken (2.5 - 3 lbs)
1 tb Fresh chopped ginger
1 tb Chopped fresh garlic
1 ts Ground turmeric
1 tb Light brown sugar
2 tb Oil
2    Stalks fresh lemon grass
-(bottom 6" only, chopped)
2 tb Chopped fresh coriander root
2 tb Fish sauce (nam pla)
Rinse the chicken and pat dry.  Split the chicken in
half down the breast or cut into serving sized pieces.

Pound or process the lemon grass, ginger, garlic, and
coriander root in a mortar, blender, or processor
until a smooth paste is formed, adding a little of the
oil if necessary. Add turmeric, brown sugar, fish
sauce, and (remaining) oil.  Blend until smooth.  Pour
mixture over the chicken, cover, and marinate in the
refrigerator for 2 hours or (up to) overnight. Turn
the pieces periodically to allow them to marinate
evenly.

Prepare hot coals for barbecuing, or preheat the
broiler. Grill the chicken until the juices from the
thickest part run clear, about 20-30 minutes.

##Note: this recipe works well for grilled Thai
Chicken Wings, too!
