Title: LEBANESE  FRESH  FRUIT  SALAD
Categories: L, E, B, A, N
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Ripe melon
1/2    Fresh pineapple
1    To 2 oranges
Apple, pear or strawberries
(depending on season)
2    Ripe bananas
Preparation : Remove melon from rind and dice. Cut pineapple into
chunks. Peel and section oranges, removing all the white membrane,
snip into chunks with kitchen shears. Toss fruit together. If fruit
is nice and ripe, the natural juices will provide plenty of
sweetness, so no sugar will be needed.  Dice the apple or pear and if
using berries, wash and hull them. Add to fruit mixture.  Just before
serving, peel, slice and add banana. Mix well.  Serves 6 to 8.
