Title: LEMON CURD COFFEE CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Cake
1 tb Active Dry Yeast
1/4 c  Warm Water
1/3 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Sour Cream
1/2 ts Lemon Rind, Grated
1/4 ts Salt
2    Eggs
2 3/4 c  White Flour
1/3 c  Butter, Softened
1    Egg
3/4 c  Ready Made Lemon Curd
Walnuts, Chopped
Preheat the oven to 360 degrees. Soak the yeast in the warm (105
degrees-115 degrees) water until dissolved. Add the sugar. Mix well.
Heat the sour cream until warm. Add to the yeast mixture along with
the lemon rind and salt. Beat in the first measure of eggs. Add
enough of the flour to make a soft dough. Beat the butter into the
dough. Turn the dough onto a floured board and knead until smooth
(6-7 minutes). Place the dough in a lightly buttered bowl. Cover
tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in bulk (45-60
minutes). Punch down. Roll out on a floured board to form an 18" x
12" rectangle. Spread the lemon curd on the dough, leaving a 3/4"
border on all sides. Carefully roll up the dough. Slice into 3 1/2"
thick slices. Place the rolls in a well greased (8") pie pan in a
circle. Let rise for about 30 minutes. Lightly beat the second
measure of egg. Brush the cake with the beaten egg. Sprinkle with
nuts. Bake for about 30 minutes.
