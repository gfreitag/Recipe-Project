Title: LE PAPET VAUDOIS
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Onion, chopped fine
1 3/4 lb Leeks, in 1"*pieces
18 oz Potatoes, diced
7/8 c  Dry white wine
7/8 c  Vegetable broth
1/2 c  Evaporated skim milk
Salt, pepper, nutmeg
1. Saute the onion in your favorite liquid. Add the leeks and saute,
then add the white wine and broth, and cook covered for 15 minutes.
Then add the potatoes, season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and cook
another 10 to 15 minutes.

2. When the potatoes and leeks are tender, add the milk and adjust the
seasoning.

This is traditionally served with sausage on top; if there is a ff
veggie one you like, try it! (No such thing here.) Very fresh crusty
bread is good with this too. (Vaud is in the French-speaking part of
Switzerland; think fresh French bread...)
