3 c  To 4 c cubed bean curd,

1/3 lb To 1/2 lb fatty pork
3 ts To 5 ts finely chopped

1/4 c  Coarsely chopped green onion
1 tb To 2 tb hot bean sauce

MMMMM-------------------------SEASONINGS------------------------------
2 tb To 3 tb cornstarch mixed 4-6

1 ts To 2 ts salt, depending on
-the saltiness of the
-hot bean sauce
1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
1 tb Soy sauce
1/2 ts Ground szechwan pepper
4 tb To 5 tb cooking oil
MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
2 tb Finely chopped garlic (never
-cook without it.. (g))
1 ts Fermented black beans (works
-well)
2    To 3 dried or fresh
-mushrooms (so-so in it)
6    To 8 pieces wood ear (I
-think these taste like
-rubber)
1 tb Sesame oil (include)
(this dish should be VERY hot)

TO PREPARE: 1. Cut the bean curd into small cubes. If desired, palce
the bean curd in boiling water in a wok or pot and boil until the
bean curd starts to float. This procedure firms the bean curd
slightly and is especially advisable if you are using soft japanese
style bean curd. 2. Chop the pork into small pieces, about 1/4 inch
by 1/4 inch, or slightly smaller. Chop the green onion coarsly. Chop
the ginger as finely as possible. 3. Mix the SEASONINGs in a cup,
first dissolving the cornstarch in water and then adding the other
ingredients.

TO COOK: 1. Heat 4-5 tbsps cooking oil in a wok or large frying pan
until very hot. (This recipe actually calls for rendered pork fat,
but I invariably use vegetable oil and fatty pork instead.) Add the
pork pieces and cook briefly. Then add the hot bean sauce, stir and
add the chopped ginger. Stir until the meat and ginger have absorbed
the red color from the hot bean sauce. Add 1 cup of stock or water.
Then carefully add the bean curd cubes and stir gently. 2. Allow the
liquid in the wok to cook down somewhat, keeping it over medium
flame. Stir occasionally, being careful not to break the bean curd
cubes. Just before the liquid has cooked away, stir the seasonings
and add the green onion. Stir, check for salt. The consistency should
now be very thick, almost custard like. If necessary add a tbsp or so
more cornstarch first mixing it with a few tbsps of water to make a
thin paste. Sprinkle ground Szechwan pepper over the bean curd. Serve
hot. Should be eaten on top of rice.
