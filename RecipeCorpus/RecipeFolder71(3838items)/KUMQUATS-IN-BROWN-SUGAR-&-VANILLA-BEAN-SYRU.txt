Title: KUMQUATS IN BROWN SUGAR & VANILLA BEAN SYRU
Categories: Side dish, Fruits, Vegetarian
Yield: 3 Quarts
4 c  Whole kumquats (25-30)
2 c  Water
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
1 ea Vanilla bean
-- halved lengthwise
By cooking kumquats down with sugar and vanilla, the
bitterness is removed from the rind and they become a
tantalizing garnish or topping for sweet or savory
dishes.

Place the kumquats in a large saucepan and add water
to cover. Bring to a full boil and, when foam begins
to form on the surface, reduce the heat to medium.
Continue to cook for 10 min more. Drain the kumquats
and set aside.

In the same saucepan over a high heat, bring the water
to a gentle boil. Add the sugars, reduce the heat to
medium, and stir constantly until the sugars have
dissolved, about 3 min. Add the kumquats and vanilla
bean and bring to a full boil. Reduce the heat to low
and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally until the
kumquats are transparent and soft, about 1 hour. Many
of the kumquats will have burst and their skins will
appear transparent.

Spoon the kumquats and syrup into a clean jar, let
cool, cover, and refrigerate. They will keep,
refrigerated, for up to 2 weeks.
