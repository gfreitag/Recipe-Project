Title: LUNCH SUGGESTIONS
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Cooked rice
1    Curry powder
1    Frozen spinach
1 cn Garbanzos
1    Raisins
Valerie's lunch: Fill a Tupperware container halfway with cooked
rice, and use frozen peas (straight out of the bag) to fill it the
rest of the way. Sprinkle curry powder on top (I use about a
Tablespoon. YMMV). Take to work, and nuke it at lunch.

My adaptation: Add some frozen spinach (see *below), some canned
garbanzos, and some raisins (especially golden raisins).

I started adding those other veggies, because my sister told me that
green peas don't contain many nutrients. They also really add to the
taste, especially the garbanzo beans.

*Regarding frozen spinach:  You may have already known this, but I
only recently discovered that you can buy frozen spinach in bags
("Family Size") instead of in those famous blocks. The spinach is
still all frozen in clumps, but the clumps are a manageable size, so
that I can add just a little to my various dishes.  I now use much
more spinach than I did before because it is so convenient.
