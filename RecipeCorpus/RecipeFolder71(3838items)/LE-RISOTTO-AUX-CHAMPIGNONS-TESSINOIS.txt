Title: LE RISOTTO AUX CHAMPIGNONS TESSINOIS
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 4 Servings
7 oz Brown rice
1    Onion, chopped fine
1    Clove garlic, chopped fine
1 ts Rosemary
1/3 oz Dried mushrooms, soaked
(bolets) - get something
Exotic &
Flavorful
7/8 c  Vegetable broth
7/8 c  Merlot or other red wine
2 oz Grated ff Parmesan (or
Sapsago, if you can find
It)
Salt, pepper
1. Cook the rice for 15 minutes in 1 3/4 cups of water.

2. Squeeze out the mushrooms and chop them. Saute the onion and
garlic in your favorite liquid, add the rosemary and mushrooms, and
boil rapidly. Add the rice and bring to a boil.

3. Add the broth and wine, and cook for 10 minutes over a low flame.
(Note ~ at this point I had much too much liquid, so I let it cook
with the top off until enough had boiled away.)

4. Season to taste with salt and pepper, add the parmesan, and serve
promptly.

(the original advises eating promptly so it doesn't get too dry; I
didn't find this to be a problem, and even reheated it for a couple
of days).
