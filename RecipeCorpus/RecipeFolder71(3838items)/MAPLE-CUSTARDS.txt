Title: MAPLE CUSTARDS
Categories: Desserts, Ew
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Pure maple syrup*, plus
4 ts For topping
3/4 c  Skim milk
2/3 c  Evaporated skim milk
2 lg Eggs
2 lg Egg yolks
*for the richest flavor, use syrup graded "Dark Amber" In a saucepan
over high heat, bring 1/2 c maple syrup to a boil. Cook until
thickened and reduced to about 1/4 c, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to
low; pour in skim milk and evaporated skim milk. Stir until the syrup
has blended with the milk. Remove from the heat.  In a mixing bowl,
lightly whisk eggs and egg yolks until combined. Gradually whisk the
hot milk mixture into the eggs. Skim off any foam and pour the
mixture into four 6 oz custard cups or ramekins.  Preheat over to 350
degrees. Place the filled custard cups in a shallow baking dish and
add enough hot water to come 2/3's of the way up the sides of the
cups. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the
center of a custard comes out clean. Serve the custards warm or
chilled, with 1 t of the remaining maple syrup drizzled over each.
