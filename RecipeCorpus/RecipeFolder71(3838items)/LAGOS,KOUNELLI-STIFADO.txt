Categories: Meats, Greek
Yield: 6 Servings
Karen Mintzias
1    Rabbit or hare
-- cut into serving pieces,
-- and marinated 1 or 2 days
-See: Lagos/Kounelli Fournou
1/4 c  Butter
2 lb Small white onions
-equal weight of rabbit/hare
1 c  Canned tomato sauce
3    Whole cloves
2    Garlic cloves
1 tb Raisins (optional)
1    Bay leaf
1 ts Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Dry white wine
2 tb Wine vinegar
Fresh rosemary
Remove the rabbit or hare from the marinade and wipe dry. In a large
casserole, heat the butter or oil and sear the rabbit or hare over
high heat until reddened in color, without browning the fat.
Meanwhile, peel the onions and cut a cross in the root end with a
sharp pointed knife to keep them from falling apart during cooking.
Arrange around the rabbit or hare, then stir in the remaining
ingredients, add enough water to cover, place an inverted plate over
the meat and bring to a boil. Transfer to a very slow oven (225 F)
and bake for 2 to 2-1/2 hours, until the rabbit or hare and onions
are tender.  Remove from the oven and carefully pour off the sauce
into a small saucepan. Boil down to 1-1/2 cups. Remove plate from
casserole, pour the sauce over, and garnish with additional rosemary.
Serve warm.

NOTE: The flavor improves the second day.
