FOR CRUST:  Blend flour, almonds, sugar and salt in processor. Add
butter and cut in, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse
meal. Combine water and extract in small bowl; pour over flour
mixture and process jsut until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into
ball; flatten into disk.  Press dough evenly over bottom and up sides
of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Freeze crust until
firm, about 30 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; keep frozen).

FOR FILLING:  Combine eggs and 1 1/4 cups sugar in heavy medium
saucepan; whisk to blend.  Mix in lemon juice and peel. Whisk over
medium-high heat until mixture is thick and almost boils, about 5
minutes. Remove from heat; whisk in butter. Transfer filling to bowl.
Chill until cold, stirring occasionally, about 2 hours. (Can be made
1 day ahead. Press plastic directly onto surface to keep skin from
forming. Keep chilled.)

Preheat oven to 400F.  Line crust with foil; fill with dried beans.
Bake until sides are set, about 15 minutes. Remove foil and beans.
Bake crust until golden, about 15 minutes. Cool completely. Reduce
oven temperature to 350F.

Spread filling in crust.  Sprinkle almonds over.  Bake until filling
puffs slightly, begins to crack at edges and moves slightly in center
when shaken, about 37 minutes. Cool completely on rack. Remove pan
sides from tart. Sprinkle tart with powdered sugar and serve.
