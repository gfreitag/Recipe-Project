Title: KATHY PITTS ON HOMINY
Categories: Info, Grains
Yield: 1 Text file  The Mexicans make a wonderful pork stew called Pozole
that contains hominy, pork, chunks of chiles, onions,
etc, topped with fresh chopped veggies, lime juice.
Don't have a recipe handy, though....

My mother used to make a pretty good hominy dish by
draining the corn, and making a cheese sauce (whatever
you make for macaroni and cheese will do nicely).  She
would then combine the hominy and cheese, top with
some pieces of cooked bacon or leftover ham, and baked
the whole thing until it was browned.  I loved it as a
kid. Made it for Wes one time, and discovered he hates
hominy as much as he hates grits, so haven't had it in
a while.

I've also had an elaborate succotash that contained
(in about equal proportions), hominy, fresh corn cut
off the cob, fresh lima beans and cooked white (navy)
beans.  Very nice stuff.

One of my aunts (a Southerner from Mississippi) used
to fry it in bacon drippings until it was brown and
serve it as a side dish. Don't recall being all that
thrilled with THAT presentation, though.
