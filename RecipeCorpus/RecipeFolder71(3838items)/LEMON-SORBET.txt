Title: LEMON SORBET
Categories: Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
Peel of 1 lemon, diced small
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Lemon juice
1/2 c  Mineral water
Lemon peel twists to garnish
Make a syrup by combining the finely diced lemon peel with the water
& the sugar in a non-corrosive pan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat &
simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat & let cool. Combine the
syrup with the lemon juice & the mineral water.

At this point, use one of two steps.  Either use an ice cream maker &
follow the maunfacturers instructions. Or, place in a tall canister &
put in the freezer. Freeze for 1 1/2 hours. Remove, stir & beat
briefly with a whisk.  Return to the freezer & repeat the beating
process after another 50 minutes. You may have to repeat this three
or four times. The more you beat your sorbet, the more air is being
incorporated & hence the lighter the finished product. Keep in the
freezer above your fridge rather than a deep freeze otherwise you'll
get a finished product that is hard. If you only have a deep freeze,
place sorbet in fridge for 1 to 2 hours before serving.

Will keep for 3 or 4 days.

NOTE: The author from whom I adapted this recipe suggested that you
do not use a deep freeze or any free standing when making sorbets
because the temperatures are too cold.  However, I have had no
success making a sorbet from scratch in a fridge-freezer. I use my
chest freezer & mix more often than is called for.  When the sorbet
is ready, then I transfer it to the fridge freezer for keeping it.
