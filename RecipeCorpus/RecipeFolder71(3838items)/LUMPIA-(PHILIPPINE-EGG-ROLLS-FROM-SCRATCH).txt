MMMMM------------------------LUMPIA SAUCE-----------------------------
2 c  Pineapple juice

1 ds Hot pepper sauce
1/2    Inch cube crushed ginger
1/4 ts Salt
1 tb Cornstarch
Doilies:  Combine flour, water and salt to taste and mix thoroughly
with a wire whisk to remove lumps. Batter should be about the
consistency of a crepe batter. Add a little water if it is too thick.
If the batter thickens as it sits, you may have to add more water.
Heat a 6" crepe pan and wipe out with lightly oiled wax paper. Pour
on batter quickly to cover the bottom.  Pour off excess. Allow to
cook over low heat until the edges begin to curl and pull away from
the sides of the pan. Remove and place on clean, dry surface. Repeat,
oiling pan each time. Do not stack doilies on top of each other until
each has cooled. Before filling, put off excess batter to make a
perfect circle.

Filling:  Cook pork or beef in a large skillet until pinkness is gone.
Drain off grease.  Add shrimp, onions, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots,
celery, garlic and carrot; cook until carrot is almost tender. Stir in
remaining ingredients except the egg white and oil. Mix well. Cook
until bean sprouts are limp.

Pour mixture into strainer and cool, allowing as much liquid as
possible to drain off before filling rolls. Use about 1 heaping tsp.
for each doily. Place filling near one side. Roll doily over filling
a couple of times; fold in sides and roll up tightly.  Seal flap with
a little egg white.

Deep fry in corn oil heated to about 375 F., until rolls are golden.
Drain thoroughly on paper towels and serve with sauce.

Note: If rolls are filled ahead of time, cover and refrigerate until
it is time to serve.  Return to room temperature and fry.

Lumpia Sauce:  Combine all ingredients but the corn starch and heat.
Meanwhile, mix corn starch with enough of the pineapple juice mixture
to make a smooth paste. Return cornstarch mixture to pot and simmer
until mixture is thick.  Makes about 3 cups.
