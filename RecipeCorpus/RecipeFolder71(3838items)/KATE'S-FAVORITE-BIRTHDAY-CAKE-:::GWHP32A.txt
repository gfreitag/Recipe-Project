Categories: Cakes, Katesmith
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Cake flour; sifted
3 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
2/3 c  Butter; or shortening
1 3/4 c  Sugar
5 ea Egg whites; unbeaten
1 c  Milk
1 ts Vanilla
Sift flour once, measure, add baking powder and salt
and sift together three times.  Cream butter
thoroughly, add sugar gradually, and cream together
until light and fluffy. Add egg whites, one at a time,
beating very thoroughly after each.  Add flour,
alternately with milk, a small amount at a time,
beating after each addition until smooth. Add vanilla.
Bake in 2 greased deep 9 inch layer pans, in a
moderate oven 375 deg. 25 minutes, or until done.
Spread Boiled Frosting (see recipe) between layers
and on top and sides of cake, making deep swirls in
the frosting around the top edge of the cake, but
smooth frosting in the center. Sprinkle tiny colored
candies in swirls of frosting around edge of cake.
Write "Happy Birthday" in the center, with tinted
frosting. Or sprinkle with coconut while frosting is
still soft. Tiny silver drag'ees may also be used for
decorating instead of the colored candies. Kate Smith
