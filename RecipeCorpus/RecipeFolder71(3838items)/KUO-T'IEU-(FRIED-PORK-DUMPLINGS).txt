Title: KUO-T'IEU (FRIED PORK DUMPLINGS)
Categories: Chinese, Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Flour, all-purpose
2/3 c  Water; warm
1/3 c  Water; cold
1 lb Pork, ground
10 oz Water chestnut; diced
3 tb Soy sauce, mushroom flavor
3 tb Oil, vegetable
2 tb Sherry
2 tb Cornstarch
1 tb Scallion; chopped
1 tb Gingerrott; chopped
2 ts Salt
2 tb Oil, sesame
Add warm water to flour, mix with chopstick, then
add cold water and knead it very well.  Stand for
15-30 minutes, cover.
Mix pork, green onion, ginger, waterchestnut, salt,
sesame oil, soy sauce, wine and cornstarch.
Place dough onto foured board and knead until
smooth. Divide dough into 40-50 pieces.  Flatten each
piece with hand and roll into 2-3" round thin
pancakes. Put 1 to 2 teaspoons of filling in center
then fold over to make a half moon and pinch edges
together.
Heat a flat pan until hot, add 2 tablespoons oil.
Put enough dumplings to cover the bottom of pan
without overlapping. Fry 2 minutes or until bottom is
golden. Add 2/3 cup cold water, cover and cook until
water has evaporated. Add 1 Tablespoon oil to side of
pan and fry another minute and serve immediately. (I
use a 12 inch cast iron skillet for this and use more
than the 2 tablespoons oil mentioned above; I also use
more than the 1 T oil at the end. Swirl the oil around
the pan when you add it at the end...this helps
removal of the pot stickers!)
For a dipping sauce, I use soy sauce, sesame oil,
chopped ginger, and chopped scallions.
My friends have told me that they have not had
better dumplings than these in any restaurant. Try
this and let me know what you think! Posted on Genie
