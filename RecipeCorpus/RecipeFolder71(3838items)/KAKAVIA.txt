In a soup pot with a wide bottom, saute the onions in
the oil, without browning, until soft.  Add the
tomatoes, fennel, herbs, wine, and water and bring to
a boil.  Season with salt and pepper to taste and
simmer for 45 minutes.  Pour the stock into a large
bowl through a sieve, squeezing all the pulp from the
vegetables before discarding the fibers remaining in
the sieve.  Return the soup stock to the pot and bring
to a boil.

Meanwhile, lightly salt the fish and let stand for 10
minutes, then rinse with water and lower into soup,
adding water only if needed to cover the fish.  Lower
the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, then add the
lobster. Cover and simmer 5 minutes longer, then add
the shrimp and scallops or mussels and simmer an
additional 10 minutes.  Taste and adjust the
seasonings.

Arrange the toast slices in large soup plates.  Serve
the varied fishes and broth in each bowl, hot, with
croutons in a separate plate.

NOTE: Kakavia is frequently made in the following
variation: Cook 2 to 3 fish with the vegetables and
strain with the vegetables to make a thicker stock.
Continue to cook the remaining seafood as described
above.
