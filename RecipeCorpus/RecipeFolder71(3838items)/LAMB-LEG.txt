Title: LAMB LEG
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings

Ingredients:

Leg of lamb garlic fresh rosemary lemon juice olive oil Well, this is
how I make it.  I always make it on a Sunday, so on Saturday night I:

Make slits in the lamb and insert slivers of garlic and fresh
rosemary Rub the lamb all over with lemon juice and olive oil (I use
my hands).

I leave the lamb overnight in my (very cool) kitchen. You should
probably put it in the fridge.

On Sunday morning, I get up, rush around and realise I am late for
church. At 10.30 I wrap the lamb loosly in foil and sit it in a
roasting tray. I put it in the oven, light the oven and set it to 150
deg.C. Then I run out the door.

At about 12.45 I walk back through the door to the gorgeous smell of
cooking lamb.  I unwrap it and replace it in the over for as long as
the potatoes and veg take to cook. When the veg are done, the lamb is
juicy, falling of the bone tender and wonderful to eat. It is not
remotely pink, though  pink lamb is a treat I save for restaurants.

I have never tried making this on another day of the week, but you
could, and I've only ever timed it using a church service I expect a
clock would work too. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40
