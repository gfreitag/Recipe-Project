8    Lamb Kidneys
200 g  Minced pork or chicken
1 sm Egg yolk
1 pn Quatre-epices
200 g  Pate de foie
4    Rashers bacon
100 ml Brandy

This is a slightly simplified version of a recipe from the bible of
French cookery, Cuisine et vins de France, by Curnonsky, the French
gastronome and bon viveur born in 1872.

Skin 8 lambs' kidneys, split them in half and core, keeping the
halves in pairs.

Mix 200 g minced pork or chicken with 1 small egg yolk, and a pinch of
quatre-epices (nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and pepper). Have ready 200 g
pate de foie. Remove rinds from 4 rashers of bacon and cut them in
half.

Take each pair of kidney halves and put a thick layer (about 1 cm) of
the mince mixture on the inside of one half and a thick layer of the
pate de foie on the other. Sandwich the stuffed halves together
gently, wrap in half a bacon rasher and secure with one or more
toothpicks. Lay the bacon and kidney parcels in a lightly oiled dish
which can go from oven to top of the stove and bake in a very hot
oven for 10-20 minutes or until cooked through.

Transfer the parcels to a heated serving dish and put the baking dish
on a hot plate. Deglaze the dish With 100 mL brandy and boil hard to
reduce. Thicken with 100 mL creme fraiche or sour cream (or use
evaporated skim milk mixed with a little cornflour), taste and season
if necessary and pour over the kidneys. Serve.
