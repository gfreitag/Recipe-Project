In small bowl, combine cherries and rum. Let soak 2 hours; drain
on paper towels.
In medium bowl, combine condensed milk and corn syrup; blend
well. Add powdered sugar gradually, stirring until mixture forms a
still smooth dough. (if all powdered sugar can't be stirred in, knead
mixture and sugar on counter until smooth dough forms). Wrap small
amounts of the fondant around each cherry to cover completely.
Refrigerate about 20 minutes or until fondant is firm.
Line cookie sheet with waxed paper. Prepare dipping chocolate by
cooking ingredients over low heat until melted, stirring occasionally.
Holding by stem, dip chilled cherries into chocolate, making sure to
cover completely. Place on waxed paper-lined cookie sheet;
refrigerate until chocolate sets, about 10 minutes. Dip chilled
candies into melted chocolate again, making sure to coat ocmpletely.
Place on lined cookie sheet then cover lightly with waxed paper.  Let
stand several days in cool place to allow fondant to liquefy. (do not
refrigerate). Store in airtight container in refrigerator (? >I just
format them). Makes 2 1/2 dozen candies. One candy is 110 calories/4g
