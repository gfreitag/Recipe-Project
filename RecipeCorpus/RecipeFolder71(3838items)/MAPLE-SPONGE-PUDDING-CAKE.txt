Canadian food writer Anita Stewart shared this recipe that she
gathered at L'Escapade, an inn at Mont Tremblant, Quebec. With a few
modifications, it has become one of my standby quick-and-easy
desserts. The sauce poured over the top ends up on the bottom.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 2-quart glass casserole or
other baking dish.

In a bowl, combine the sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt and stir
to mix well. Whisk in the milk and 1/4 cup of the butter to blend
well. Scrape the fairly stiff batter into the prepared baking dish.

In a saucepan, bring the syrup to a boil. Remove from the heat and
stir in the remaining 1/4 cup butter and the vanilla. Immediately
pour the mixture over the pudding batter. Bake until puffy, bubbling,
and golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.

Serve warm. Offer creme fraiche or a pitcher of cream for topping the
pudding at the table.
