Title: LEMON CURD (PRODIGY)
Categories: Desserts, Sauces, Jams, Pies
Yield: 1 Servings
5    Whole eggs
5    Egg yolks
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Fresh lemon juice
2    Lemons, grated zest only
8 tb Sweet butter
COMBINE THE EGGS, EGG YOLKS and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat until
smooth. Add the lemon juice and lemon zest and mix. Place the bowl
over a pot of boiling water or in the top of a double boiler and stir
vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture thickens. This
mixture will not curdle, so don't worry about overcooking it a
little. Remove the bowl from the boiling water and stir in the butter
until melted. Refrigerated, this will keep for up to 3 months.

TO MAKE A LEMON CUSTARD PIE: Preheat oven to 375F. Fill a 9-inch pie
shell and bake for 15 minutes.
