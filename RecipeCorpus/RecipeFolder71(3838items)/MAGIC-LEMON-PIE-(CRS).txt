Title: MAGIC LEMON PIE (CRS)
Categories: Pies
Yield: 8 Servings
Lemon filling:
15 oz Milk; sweetened condensed
1/2 c  Lemon juice
1 ts Lemon zest
2    Egg yolks
Meringue:
2    Egg whites
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
4 tb Sugar
Graham cracker crust:
18    Graham cracker squares
1/4 lb Butter or margarine,
1/3 c  Sugar
1/8 ts Cinnamon
Thoroughly mix crust ingredients and pack into a nine inch pie pan.
Bake at 375 degrees for 10 minutes and put aside to cool. Reduce oven
temperature to 325 degrees. In a mixing bowl, combine condensed milk,
lemon juice, lemon zest and egg yolks.  Stir until mixture thickens.
Pour into cooled crust.  Add cream of tartar to the egg whites and
beat until almost stiff. Add sugar gradually, beating until stiff and
glossy but not dry. Pile lightly on pie filling. Bake at 325 until
lightly browned, about 15 minutes.  Cool thoroughly. Enjoy! Hint: try
to get the crust thickness very even and not too thick. Source: CRS
