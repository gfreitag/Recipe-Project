*DIRECTIONS*

Pudding Base: In a saucepan combine sugar and corn starch. Gradually
blend in water.  Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture comes
to a boil and thickens.  Boil and stir 1 minute longer.  Whisk about
1/3 the mixture into egg yolks; return yolk mixture to pan. Cook and
stir over low heat 1 minutes.  Stir in butter, lemon rind and juice.
Cover surface with plastic wrap; cool.

Meringue: Beat egg whites with lemon juice until frothy. Gradually
beat in sugar until mixture forms stiff peaks. Fold meringue into
cooled pudding. Refrigerate until serving.  Serve with fresh fruit,
if desired. Yields 4-5 servings.  Cooling time: about 1 hour.

Note: For uncooked meringue use only Canada Grade A eggs, with clean,
uncracked shells.

Alternative: For a richer dessert eliminate meringue step and instead
fold in 1 cup whipping cream, whipped into cooled pudding.
Refrigerate until served.
