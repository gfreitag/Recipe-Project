Add lemons; simmer 10 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Let stand
overnight.

Cut in butter until dough forms particles the size of small peas.
Stir in egg with a fork; blend well. Shape into a ball; flatten
slightly. On floured pastry cloth, roll out to an 11 1/2-inch circle.
Preheat oven to 375. Line 10-inch tart pan with removable bottom with
the pastry.  Trim pastry even with rim of pan using rolling pin.
Bake 25 minutes. Remove from oven. Reduce oven temperature to 350.
