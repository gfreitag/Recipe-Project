Sure...Kecap (or, more commonly, "ketjap") refers to a
number of sauces from Indonesia; the most common is
ketjap manis, which is the Indonesian kind of soy
sauce, and is rather sweeter than Chinese soy sauce or
Japanese shoji or tamari.  (It's pronounced "ketchup",
btw.)

Recipe follows:

Number of Servings: 40 Approx. Cook Time: 0:30

Combine and sugar and water in a 2-quart stainless
steel saucepan and bring to a boil over moderate heat,
stirring until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat
to high and cook briskly, uncovered, for 5 minutes or
until the syrup reaches 200F on a candy thermometer.
Reduce the heat to low, stir in the soy sauce,
molasses, galangal, cilantro, and pepper, and simmer
for 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat; let cool.

Strain the sauce through a fine sieve set over a bowl.
Sauce will keep at room temperature for 2 to 3 months
if tightly covered.
