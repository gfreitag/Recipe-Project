Title: KEY LIME PIE "ORIGINAL"  ** (SWMG52B)
Categories: Pies, Desserts, American
Yield: 8 Servings
1 ea Unflavored gelatin
1/4 c  Water
2/3 c  Sugar; divided
1/2 c  Key lime juice
1/4 ts Salt
2 ts Grated lime rind
4 ea Eggs; separated
ea baked pastry shell I got this recipe from a
9"
"Cracker," and it will dispute the previous statement
that all will agree on how to make the best Key Lime
Pie. My tree froze, but came back, so we've enjoyed
this recipe a lot this year. Mix togethe gelatin, 1/3
c sugar and salt in saucepan. Combine slightly beaten
egg yolks, water & lime juice. Add to gelatin mixture.
Place over low heat, stirring constantly, until
gelatin dissolves, about 6 min. Remove from heat and
add rind. Cool. Beat egg whites until stiff but not
dry. Gradually add remaining 1/3 c sugar and beat
until stiff. Fold in gelatin mixture. Turn into pastry
shell and chill until firm. Garnish with whipped cream
and lime slices if desired. Note: To make lime chiffon
cream pie, fold in 1/2 c heavy cream, whipped before
turning into pastry shell. This is a much lighter pie
than the one using sweetened consensed milk, and I
think it has a more of the flavor of Key limes. Ann,
