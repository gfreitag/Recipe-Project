Title: LAMB CHOPS WITH MUSTARD & CHIVES
Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Main dish, Veal
Yield: 2 Servings
1 tb Oil
4    Loin or rib lamb chops
-- each 1 to 1 1/2" thick
1/2 c  Beef, veal or chicken stock
1 tb Fresh chives; minced
1 tb Dijon mustard or other hot
-homemade mustard
Salt and pepper; to taste
Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet.  Sear chops quickly on both sides
to seal in juices.  Reduce heat to medium and allow to cook, turning
several times, to desired doneness - 10 to 12 minutes. (To test, make
a small cut next to the bone.  If it's light pink, it's perfect.)
Pour off some of the fat from the pan.

Remove cooked chops to a heated platter and keep warm. To deglaze, add
stock to skillet and stir, scraping up any meat bits from bottom of
pan. Reduce over high heat until slightly thickened. Remove pan from
heat (turn heat to low); stir in chives and mustard. Return pan to
low heat to warm the mustard, but do not allow to boil. Add any
juices that may have accumulated around chops.  Season with salt and
pepper. Serve sauce at once, poured over lamb chops.

Enright suggests serving this with buttered noodles and broiled tomato
halves.
