2 lb Mackerel filets
2 oz Margarine
1    Lg. onion, chopped
1/2 lb Rhubarb, chopped
Pepper and salt
Toasted breadcrumbs
1 lb Rhubarb (for the sauce)
2 tb Sugar (for the sauce)

Melt the margarine (or butter) and cook the onion in it until
transparent.
Add the chopped rhubarb, season with pepper and salt and continue to
cook gently for 5 minutes.  Then add breadcrumbs and stir the
mixture. 

stuffing on them.  Roll each up, put them in a greased oven dish and
cook them in a moderate oven (400F) for 15-20 minutes. 
. While the fish are being cooked, make the rhubarb sauce by placing
all the ingredients listed in a saucepan and stewing tehm until the

little longer. Then put the cooked rhubarb through a fine sieve or
the blender, to make a puree of it.  This can be served either hot or
cold with the cooked mackerel.
