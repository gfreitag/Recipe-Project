Title: LIMPA
Categories: Breads, Swedish
Yield: 2 Loaves
1 pk Yeast, dry
1 ts Sugar, granulated
1/2 c  ;Water, warm (100 F.)
2 c  Beer; heated to lukewarm
1/2 c  Honey; to 1/2 cup
2 tb Butter; melted
2 ts Salt
1 ts Cardamom, ground (opt)
1 tb Caraway seeds; crushed, or
3/4 ts Aniseed; crushed
2 tb Orange peel, fresh or
-candied; chopped
2 1/2 c  Flour, rye
3 c  Flour, unbleached
Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water in a large bowl and proof
for five minutes.  Combine the beer, the honey (adjust for how sweet
you like your bread) butter, and salt, and stir well. Add to the
yeast mixture. Add the spices and orange peel.  Mix the flours, then
add three cups of this mixture to the liquid and beat briskly. Cover
with a tea towel, and let rise in a warm, dark place for about an
hour. Stir down and add enough of the remaining flour to make a
pretty stiff but still sticky dough. Turn out on a very well-floured
board, and work the dough until it is smooth and elastic.  Add more
flour to the board as needed. While the dough will not lose its
tackiness completely it will smooth out a lot. Shape it into a ball,
oil the surface, and place in an oiled bowl. Cover with the tea towel
again and let rise a second time, about one hour. Punch down, shape
into two balls, and put on a greased baking sheet sprinkled with
cornmeal. Brush with melted butter, cover loosely with waxed paper,
and refrigerate for three hours. Remove from the fridge and let sit
on the counter, uncovered, for ten to fifteen minutes. Bake in a 375
F. oven until the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom;
about 40 to 45 minutes. Cool before slicing.
