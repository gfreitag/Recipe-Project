Title: LINGUINE WITH AVOCADO PESTO
Categories: Herbs, Pasta
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Linguine
1 c  Chopped fresh basil packed
1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley packed
2 ts Crushed garlic
1    Ripe avocado,peeled chopped
2 tb Olive oil
1/4 c  Parmensan cheese
1 c  Chicken stock or water
2 ts Lemon juice
2 tb Toasted pine nuts
1.  Cook pasta in boling water according to package instruction or
until firm to bite.  Drain and place in serving bowl. 2. In food
processor puree basil, parsley, garlic, avocado, oil, 2 tbsp of the
Parmensan cheese, stock and lemon juice until smooth. Pour over
pasta. Sprinkle with pine nuts and remaining Parmensan cheese. Toss.

tips:  Even with lemon juice the pesto may discolour, if this
happens, skim off the darkened surface and discard. Toast pine nuts
in a skillet on stove top for 2 to 3 minutes until brown. This is
like a guacamole dressing with much less fat due to the basil and
parsley. For a stronger flavor use all basil and no parsley.
