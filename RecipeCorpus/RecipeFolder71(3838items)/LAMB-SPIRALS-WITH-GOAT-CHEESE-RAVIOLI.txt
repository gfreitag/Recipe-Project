*A "paillarde" is a piece of meat that has been pounded flat before
cooking.  The paillardes for this recipe should be 4 oz. each, and 5
x5 x 1/8".

Prepare each paillarde by pounding a 4 oz. portion between waxed paper
until of the desired size and thickness.

Place lamb pieces flat on a cutting board.  Mix roasted garlic with
roasted pine nuts and olive oil in a blender until smooth. Season
with pinches of salt and pepper; spread evenly on lamb. Roll the lamb
into spirals, making four separate portions.  Tie string around the
lamb to hold the spiral in shape.  Season; set aside.

To prepare ravioli, mix goat cheese with Italian parsley and a pinch
of pepper.  Put a dab of cheese mixture into the center of the wonton
wrapper. Wet the edges of the wrapper; fold and securely pinch the
edges together.

Prepare the beurre blanc.

Charbroil lamb spirals to medium rare.  Remove string and slice into
20 pieces (5 slices per lamb spiral). Cook ravioli in boiling water
until done.  Toss ravioli with beurre blanc and place in center of
four plates. Put five lamb spirals around inner rim of each plate,
sauce the meat with veal glaze, garnish ravioli with savory and pink
peppercorns and serve.
