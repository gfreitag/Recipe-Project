1/2 lb Shiitake mushrooms*
1/2 lb Chanterelle mushrooms *
4    Cloves garlic, finely

This sophisticated but comforting gratin is from Gerald Hirogoyen of
Fringale Restaurant in San Francisco.

Cook macaroni until al dente in 2 quarts rapidly boiling water,
salted to taste. Drain and rinse in cold water, then set aside.

While macaroni is cooking, saute mushrooms together with garlic and
shallots in olive oil until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes, then add
chives and parsley.

Toss drained macaroni with sauteed teed mushrooms and arrange in an
oven-safe dish. Bake in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes,
stirring occasionally, until mixture is heated through.

Sprinkle with cheese, broil for 1 or 2 minutes, just until cheese is
melted and browned. Serve immediately.
