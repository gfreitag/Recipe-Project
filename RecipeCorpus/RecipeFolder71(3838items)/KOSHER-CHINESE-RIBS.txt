Judy, as you requested, from the Spice & Spirit
Jewish CB, one of my husband's favorites. Use: 10-inch
skillet Yields: 4 servings or one husband Heat oil in
10-inch skillet and brown ribs over medium flame. When
done remove ribs from skillet and set aside. In oil
remaining in skillet, saute onion, green pepper and
garlic. Add pineapple juice, vinegar, water, ketchup,
and soy sauce, stirring until smooth. Combine
cornstarch and water and add to sauce with brown
sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce
heat and add ribs. Simmer, uncovered, 1 hour or until
tender, stirring occasionally. Serve hot. I usually
end up making 4 batches at once and freezing the
leftovers. They microwave nicely for later on. Enjoy.
