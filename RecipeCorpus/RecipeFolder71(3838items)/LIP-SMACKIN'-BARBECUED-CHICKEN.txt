Title: LIP SMACKIN' BARBECUED CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Main dish, Bbq
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Chicken pieces
1/2 c  Bottled Italian dressing
1/2 c  Bottled chili sauce
1 tb Molasses or dark corn syrup
If desired, pull off and discard the skin from the chicken. Place the
chicken in a shallow dish and brush with 1/4 cup of the italian
dressing. Refrigerate, covered, up to 3 hours.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the remaining 1/4 cup italian
dressing, the chili sauce and molasses, and bring to a boil. Reduce
heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes.

Grill the chicken over medium coals (or broil 5-6 inches from heat),
turning two or three times, for 15 minutes. Brush with some of the
sauce and continue to grill, turning and brushing two or three times,
until chicken is tender, juices run clear and meat is no longer pink,
10-15 minutes more.
