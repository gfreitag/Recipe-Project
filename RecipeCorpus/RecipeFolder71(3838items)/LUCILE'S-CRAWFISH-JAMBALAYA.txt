Title: LUCILE'S CRAWFISH JAMBALAYA
Categories: Cajun, Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Flour
2 tb Oil, canola preferably
1 c  Chopped onions
5 cl Garlic, minced
1 lb Crawfish tails or shrimp
1 1/8 c  Uncooked, long-grain rice
1/2 c  Chopped celery
1/2 c  Chopped green pepper
2 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper, or to taste
In a large pot over medium-low heat, make a roux with flour and oil.
Cook stirring constantly, until golden brown and smooth, at least 20
minutes, preferably longer. Add onions and garlic and cook until
almost soft. Add 1-1/2 cups cold water and simmer 30 minutes. Add
crawfish and cook about 10 minutes. (note: if using chicken or
sausage, cook ingredients longer to ensure they'll be done when rice
is done.) Add 2 more cups of water and bring to a boil.  Add
remaining ingredients, stir to blend, but not too much.  Reduce heat
to low, cover pot, and cook about 30 minutes or until rice is cooked.
Try not to open lid during final cooking. Fluff rice thoroughly with
fork before serving.
