Title: LA PARILLA GREEN CHILE SALSA
Categories: Mexican, Salsas, Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Clove garlic
1    Thick slice white onion
1    Roma (plum) tomato
1    Tomatillo
3    Poblano chiles
1/2 c  Water
1 tb Fresh cilantro -- roughly
Chopped
1/8 ts Kosher salt
1/4 ts Cumin -- toasted and ground
Green chiles -- poblanos, Anaheims, and New Mexico long greens --
always make me think of Santa Fe. There, they make salsa with the
local chiles and bottle it for sale around the world. This fresh
version has more complex seasonings than the Santa Fe product, and is
one of the truly great salsas for dipping and slathering all over
everything.

Pan roast garlic until brown and soft, then peel.  Pan roast onion
until brown and soft, then roughly chop. Pan roast tomato until
blistered, deeply browned, and soft. Pan roast tomatillo until
blistered, browned, and soft. Pan roast poblano chiles until dark
brown, then remove seed cores.

Place the garlic, onion, tomato, tomatillo, and chiles in a food
processor and pulse briefly until finely chopped. Add the water,
cilantro, salt and cumin and process again until blended. Keeps,
tightly covered, about 3 days in the refrigerator.

Makes about 1 1/4 cups.
