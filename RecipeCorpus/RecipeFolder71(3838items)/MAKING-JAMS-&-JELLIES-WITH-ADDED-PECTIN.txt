Title: MAKING JAMS & JELLIES WITH ADDED PECTIN
Categories: Canning, Preserves
Yield: 1 Recipe  Fresh fruits and juices as well as commercially caned or frozen fruit
juice can be used with commercially prepared powdered or liquid
pectins. The order of combining ingredients depends on the type of
pectin used. Complete directions for a variety of fruits are provided
with packaged pectin. Jelly or jam made with added pectin requires
less cooking and generally gives a larger yield. These products have
more natural fruit flavors, too. In addition, using added pectin
eliminates the need to test hot jellies and jams for proper gelling.
Adding 1/2 teaspoon of butter or margarine with the juice and pectin
will reduce foaming. However, these may cause off-flavor in a
long-term storage of jellies and jams. Recipes available using
packaged pectin include:

Jellies--Apple, crab apple, blackberry, boysenberry, dewberry,
currant, elderberry, grape, mayhaw, mint, peach, plum, black or red
raspberry, loganberry, rhubarb, and strawberry.

Jams--Apricot, blackberry, boysenberry, dewberry, loganberry, red
raspberry, youngberry, blueberry, cherry, currant, fig, gooseberry,
grape, orange marmalade, peach, pear, plum, rhubarb, strawberry, and
spiced tomato.

Be sure to use Mason canning jars, self-sealing two-piece lids, and a
5-minute process (corrected for altitude, as necessary) in boiling
water. For more information about jams and jellies see "Preparing
butters, jams, jellies, and marmalades".

Purchase fresh fruit pectin each year. Old pectin may result in poor
gels. Follow the instructions with each package and the process times
recommended in Table 1. Table 1. Recommended process time for Jellies
and Jam with Added Pectin in a boiling-water canner.

Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: Half-pints or Pints. Process Time at
Altitudes of 0 - 1,000 ft: 5 min.
1,001 - 6,000 ft: 10 min.
Above 6,000 ft: 15 min.
