Title: M&M/MARS 3 MUSKETEERS
Categories: Candies, Seafood, Dressings
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Granulated sugar
3/4 c  Light corn syrup
3/4 c  Water
1/8 ts Salt
3    Egg whites
1/3 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
2    Bags milk chocolate chips
(12-ounce bags)
1.  In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, corn
syrup, water, adn salt.  Heat, stirring, to boiling, then continue to
cook, using a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature. 2. Beat
the egg whites until they are stiff and form peaks.  Don't use a
plastic bowl for this. 3. When the sugar solution comes to 270
degrees F, or the soft-crack stage, remove from the heat and pour the
mixture in thin streams into the egg whites, blending completely with
a mixer set on low speed. 4. Continue to mix until the candy begins
to harden to the consistency of dough. This may take as long as 20
minutes.  At this point, add the semisweet chocolate chips.  Remember
that the candy must already be at the consistency of dough when you
add the chocolate;  the nougat will thicken no more after the
chocolate is added. 5.  When the chocolate is thoroughly blended and
the nougat has thickened, press it into a greased 9x9-inch pan.
Refrigerate until firm, about 30  minutes. 6. With a sharp knife, cut
the candy in half down the middle of the pan. Then cut across into 7
segments to create a total of 14 bars. 7.  Melt the milk chocolate
chips in the microwave for 2 minutes on half  power, stirring halfway
through the heatingtime. Melt completely, but be careful not to
overheat. 8. Resting a bar on a fork (and using your fingers if
needed), dip each  bar into the chocolate to coat completely and
place on wax paper. Cool till firm at room temperature, 1 to 2 hours.
Makes 14 candy bars.
