1/4 ts Turmeric, ground
1/4 ts Pepper

3 tb Oil
2 md Onion; sliced
1/4 ts Turmeric, ground
1 c  Tomato; chopped
1 ts Salt
5 c  ;Water
1 c  Peas, green; fresh or frozen
Mix all the meatball ingredients together and roll
into balls, 2-1/2 inches in diameter, firmly packed.
Refrigerate them for 1 hour.

To make the broth, heat the oil in a pan or soup
kettle, add the onions and turmeric, and stir-fry over
moderate heat until light brown, about 3 minutes.  Add
the tomatoes and salt and stir-fry for 2 minutes more.
Add the water and bring to a boil.

Moisten your hands with cold water.  Take each herbed
ball and roll it firmly; add the balls to the broth
very carefully, one at a one, so that they do not not
fall apart.  The water should just cover the balls.
Cover the pan and cook over moderately low heat,
without stirring, for 45 minutes.  Add the green peas
and cook for 10 minutes more. The broth will reduce
somewhat, the balls swell considerably due to the
expansion of the rice.

Serve warm -- with the meatballs in the broth.  Makes
12    balls.
