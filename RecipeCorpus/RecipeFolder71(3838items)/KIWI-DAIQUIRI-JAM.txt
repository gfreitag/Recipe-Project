Title: KIWI DAIQUIRI JAM
Categories: Condiments, Jams
Yield: 4 Servings
5    Kiwifruit, peeled
3 c  Sugar
2/3 c  Unsweetened pineapple juice
1/3 c  Fresh lime juice
1    Pouch 85ml/3oz liquid pectin
Green food colour, optional
4 tb Rum (or sub. fruit juice?)
Fill boiling water canner with water.  Place 4 clean
half-pint mason jars in canner.  Cover, bring water to
a boil; boil at least 10 min to sterilize jars at
altitudes up to 1000 ft.

Place snap lids in boiling water, boil 5 min to soften
sealing compound.

In a large stainless steel or enamel saucepan, mash
kiwifruit to applesauce consistency.  Stir in sugar,
pineapple and lime juice.  Bring to a full rolling
boil, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Stirring
constantly, boil vigorously for 2 minutes.

Remove from heat, stir in pectin.  Continue stirring 5
minutes to prevent floating fruit.  (If desired, add
green food colouring to create a more lively,
intensely green jam.)  Stir in rum.

Ladle jam into a hot sterilized jar to within 1/4 inch
of top rim.  Remove air bubbles by sliding rubber
spatula between glass and food; readjust head space to
1/4 inch.  Wipe jar rim removing any stickiness.
Center snap lid on jar; apply screw band just until
fingertip tight.  Place jar in canner. Repeat for
remaining jam.

Cover canner, return water to a boil, process 5
minutes at altitutes up to 1000 ft.  Remove jars.
Cool 24 hours.  Check jar seals.  (Sealed lids curve
downward.)  Remove screw bands.  Wipe jars, label and
store in a cool dark place.
