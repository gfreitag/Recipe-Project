6 tb Butter
6 tb All-purpose flour
1 c  Whole milk
1 1/2 c  Chicken broth
1/3 c  Dry sherry
1/3 c  Heavy cream

MMMMM----------------------CHICKEN FILLING---------------------------
8 oz Fresh mushrooms
2 tb Butter
3 c  Chicken cooked and cubed
1 c  Chicken veloute
MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
3/4 c  Provolone, shredded 4oz.
3/4 c  Swiss cheese, shredded 4oz.
1/4 c  Parmesan, grated 1.5 oz.
1/4 ts Paprika
4 c  Broccoli florets, steamed
2 c  Chicken veloute
12    Crepes - plain not sweet
To make the Chicken Veloute: Melt the butter in a medium size
saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour, bring to bubbling and let
bubble a couple of minutes to get rid of the floury taste. Add the
milk and chicken broth; cook, stirring, until thickened and bubbly.
Stir in the sherry and heavy cream; season to taste.

To make the filling: Cut the mushrooms into 1/4inch slices. In a heavy
skillet, melt the butter over medium high heat. Add the mushrooms and
saute about 2 minutes or just until limp. Remove from the heat and
transfer to a large bown and cool to room temp. combine the mushrooms
with the cubed cooked chicken and one cup chicken veloute.

To finish: Toss together the cheeses and paprika in a bowl; set aside.
Spread about 1/4c filling over the unbrowned side of each of 12
crepes. Divide the broccoli over the chicken filling and roll up the
crepes. The crepes can now be placed, seam side down in one large
lightly greased gratin dish. Cover with 2 cups chicken veloute and
sprinkle with the cheese mixture.

Or, serve the crepes in individual gratin dishes- 2 per serving - and
divide the sauce and cheese mixture among them. Can be prepared to
this point, covered lightly with plastic wrap and refrigerated.
Remove from fridge at least 30 minutes before baking.

To finish the crepes, bake in a preheated 375F oven for 10-12 minutes
or until bubbly and beginning to brown. Makes 6 servings of 2 crepes
each.
