Title: LORRAINE'S DINNER OR CINNAMON ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 48 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------ROLLS--------------------------------
3    Eggs
1 c  Boiling water
3/4 c  Shortening
3/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Salt
2    Envelopes dry yeast,
- dissolved in 1/2 cup
- lukewarm water
1 c  Lukewarm water
8 c  Flour
1/2 c  Melted butter
1 c  Sugar, *combined with*
1 tb Cinnamon (optional)
1 c  Raisins
Glaze (recipe follows)
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
1 lb Confectioners' sugar
1/4 c  Milk
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 lb Butter, softened
Beat eggs until frothy; set aside.  In large bowl, add boiling water
to shortening, sugar and salt.  Add 1 cup lukewarm water. In separate
bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup lukewarm water. When first mixture is
lukewarm, add yeast mixture.  Add flour until batter is beatable,
then keep adding until you can barely handle sticky dough. Knead
lightly to mix. Dough should be slightly sticky.  Put in well-greased
bowl and cover loosely. Place in warm area to rise.  When dough has
doubled in size and is very light, punch down and divide into 4 equal
pieces. I usually make a half-batch of each kind.  To make crescent
rolls, roll each piece to 10 inches in diameter.  Cut into 12
pie-shaped pieces. Brush pieces with melted butter and roll up
tightly, beginning at wide end. Seal points firmly.  Place on greased
baking sheets, about 1 inch apart with points tucked under.  Let rise
until doubled in bulk. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. While
still warm, brush with melted butter. To make cinnamon rolls, brush 4
pieces of dough with melted butter, then sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar
mixture and raisins. Roll up jellyroll-style and cut each into 12
pieces. Bake at 375 for 20 minutes. Glaze rolls while still hot.
Makes 48 rolls. GLAZE: Combine ingredients and beat until smooth and
pretty thin. Spread over hot rolls.
