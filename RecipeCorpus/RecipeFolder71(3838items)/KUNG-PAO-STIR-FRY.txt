Title: KUNG PAO STIR-FRY
Categories: Chinese, Chicken
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Whole chicken breast,
-skinned and boned
2 tb Cornstarch, divided
3 tb Kikkoman teriyaki sauce,
-divided
1/4 ts Ground red pepper (cayenne)
3/4 c  Water
4 tb Distilled white vinegar
3/4 lb Romaine lettuce
2 tb Oil, divided
1/3 c  Roasted peanuts
Cut chicken into thin strips.  Combine 1 Tb. each
cornstarch and teriyaki sauce with red pepper in small
bowl; stir in chicken. Let stand 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine water, remaining 1 Tb. cornstarch
and 2 Tb. teriyaki sauce with vinegar; set aside.
Separate and rinse lettuce; pat dry.  Cut leaves
crosswise into 2" strips.  Heat 1 Tb. oil in hot wok
or large skillet over high heat.  Add chicken and
stir-fry 2 minutes; remove.  Heat remaining 1 Tb. oil
in same pan.  Add lettuce; stir-fry 1 minute.  Stir in
chicken and teriyaki sauce mixture.  Cook and stir
until mixture boils and thickens.  Remove from heat;
stir in peanuts.  Serve immediately.

Note:  I think I would substitute onion pieces for the
lettuce, perhaps 1 lg. onion, cut into 1/4" pieces.
Serves:  4
