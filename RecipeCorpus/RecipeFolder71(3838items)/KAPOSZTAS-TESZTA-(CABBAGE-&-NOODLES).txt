Title: KAPOSZTAS TESZTA (CABBAGE & NOODLES)
Categories: Noodles, Hungarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lg Head of cabbage
3 sl Bacon
Salt and pepper
1 pk Wide egg noodles
Preparation: Grate cabbage onto a large dish or
platter. Sprinkle liberally with salt and let stand
for 1/2 hr. This will help release excess water. While
cabbage is "resting", fry the bacon to rend the fat.
Discard bacon or make a B.L.T. Squeeze out water from
the cabbage and saute in the bacon drippings until
golden brown. Add salt and pepper to taste. Meanwhile,
break up the egg noodles so that they're short and fat
rather than long and fat. Boil according to directions
on box. When cabbage is done, add the noodles and mix
thoroughly. This dish is even better the second day.
Serve as a side dish or, if you make enough of it, a
main course.
