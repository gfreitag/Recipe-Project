Title: LITTLE DEVILS
Categories: Pulses
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Raw peanuts
1/2 c  (yes cup) Tabasco or other
-hot pepper sauce
Peanut oil
Salt to taste
Combine the peanuts with the Tabasco in a small bowl. Let the nuts
sit in the sauce for about 30 minutes.

Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200 F
to 220 F.

Select a smokeproof dish that will hold the peanuts in a single layer.
Thickly coat the dish with the oil. Add the peanuts, stir them, and
sprinkle with salt.

Place the peanuts in the smoker and cook until the peanuts are well
browned and dry, 50 to 60 minutes. Check the nuts toward the end of
the cooking time to avoid burning.

Transfer the peanuts to absorbent paper to cool. Serve immediately or
keep in a covered jar for several days.
