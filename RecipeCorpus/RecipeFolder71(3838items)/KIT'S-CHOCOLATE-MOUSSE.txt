Title: KIT'S CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 12 Servings
18 oz Semisweet chocolate
2 c  Heavy cream; well chilled
6 ea Egg
2 tb Confectioner's sugar
2 tb Creme de cacao
1 tb Vanilla extract
1.  Melt the chocolate over hot water. Let it cool
until only warm. 2.
While the chocolate cools, whip the cream until it
forms medium-stiff peaks. Do not overbeat or the
mousse will lose some of its smooth, light texture. 3.
Separate 4 of the eggs and set the whites aside.
Combine yolks with the 2 remaining whole eggs in the
bowl of an electric mixer. Beat until eggs are thick
and lemon colored, around 5 minutes. While the yolks
are beating, place the 4 egg whites in a clean copper
or stainless steel bowl and whisk, preferably by hand,
until the whites start to stiffen. Sprinkle on the
confectioners' sugar and beat until you have firm
peaks. 4.  Working quickly, add the cooled melted
chocolate and a scoop of the whipped cream to the egg
yolks. Stir until smooth, then add the remaining
cream. When it is fully incorporated, add the liqueur
and vanilla, then fold in the whites until just
blended. 5.  This mousse can be poured into small
individual serving dishes or into 1 larger dessert
dish. Chill at least 4 hours before serving. (Chilling
it overnight intensifies the flavor.) The mousse may
be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Remove from the freezer
and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight before
serving. VARIATION: Make a Brownie Cookie Crust from
the Brownie Cookies recipe, then fill it with the
mousse. Chill for 4 hours, then pipe whipped cream on
top.
