Title: KHATTA MOONG (SOURED LENTILS)
Categories: Indian, Vegetarian, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 3 Servings
2/3 c  Yogurt
2/3 c  Mung dal
3 c  Water
1/2 ts Turmeric, ground
1 ts Salt
3 3/4 c  Water
2 tb Gram flour
4    Chiles, green
1    Ginger, fresh; 1/2" knob
2 ts Ghee
1    Cinnamon stick, 1"
1/2 ts Cumin, whole
1 pn Hing
1/2 ts Sugar
2 tb Cilantro leaves; chopped
Let the yogurt sit for 24 hours at room temperature so
that it has a slightly sour taste.

Wash the dal thoroughly.  Place the dal, 3 cups water,
a pinch of turmeric and 1/2 tsp salt in a saucepan and
bring to a boil.  Lower the heat, cover loosely, and
simmer until the dal has split open but is still
whole. (It should not become mushy.) Drain and put
aside. Whisk together the yogurt, 3 3/4 cups water and
gram flour.  [Add the water gradually, and quit when a
good-looking consistency is reached.]

Grind two of the chilies and the ginger to a paste.
Heat the ghee in a large saucepan.  Add the remaining
two chilies, broken in half, cinnamon, cumin, and hing
and let them sizzle for 5 or 6 seconds.

Add the yogurt mixture, the remaining turmeric and
salt, sugar and the chili and ginger paste.  Stirring
constantly, cook for 5 to 7 minutes.

Add the drained dal and cook for a further 5 minutes
until thick. Garnish with the chopped cilantro leaves.
