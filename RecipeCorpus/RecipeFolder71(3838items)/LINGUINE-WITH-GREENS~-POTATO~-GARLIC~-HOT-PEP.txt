Yield: 4 Servings
6    (6 to 8) Little new potatoes
1/2 c  Cooked green beans
(optional)
1/2 lb Pasta (shells, penne,

1/2 c  Vegetable stock
1/2 c  Diced onions
2 ts Finely minced garlic
2 ts Hot red pepper flakes

1 1/2 c  Diced, peeled plum tomatoes

Tomato juice

Arugula, dandelion, chard)

Bake the potatoes in a 350F oven for 35-40 minutes, until tender but
firm. Or steam them in water or vegetable stock to cover. If you
steam them in vegetable stock, reserve it for the pasta sauce.  When
cool enough to handle, cut the potatoes into 1-inch chunks. If you
are including green beans, cook them in vegetable stock and
immediately refresh in cold water. Drop the pasta into a large kettle
of boiling salted water. Stir. Heat the 1/2 cup stock in a saute pan
over moderate heat. Add the onions and cook, covered, until tender,
about 10 minutes.  Add the garlic and optional hot red pepper flakes
and cook 2 minutes longer. Add the tomatoes, tomato liquid, potatoes,
and greens and optional beans and cook until the greens are wilted
and the potatoes are heated through. Season with salt and pepper.
When the pasta is al dente, drain it and toss with the sauce in a
warmed bowl. Note:  Canned tomatoes can be substituted for fresh.
