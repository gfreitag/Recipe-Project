In a medium saucepan, bring chicken stock to a boil over high heat.
Boil until reduced to 1 cup and reserve. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large nonstick saute pan, heat 1 tb oil over medium heat. Add
shallots and saute until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from
heat, add Madeira and carefully return to high heat. Boil until
reduced to a syrup. Add reduced chicken stock, thyme sprigs, and
rosemary sprigs and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook over high heat
until mixture is slightly reduced, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour into a
shallow casserole, add mushroom caps, stem sides up. Cover and braise
in the over for 30 minutes. Take casserole from oven, remove mushroom
caps and set aside. Strain braising liquid and set it aside. Heat
remaining 1 ts oil in a nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat. Add
leeks and stir until translucent. Add braising sauce and cook until
sauce is thick and thoroughly coats leeks, 5 to 8 minutes. Cool sauce
slightly; stir in chopped fresh thyme, rosemary, and parsley. Stuff
mushroom caps with leek filling; arrange caps on a small baking
sheet. Preheat broiler. Just before serving, sprinkle stuffed
mushrooms with cheese. Broil until heated through and cheese melts,
about 1 minute.
