Categories: Rice, Pork, Chinese
Yield: 20 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
3 c  Glutinous Rice Flour
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Water
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
4 oz Pork loin
1 ts Rice wine
1/2 tb Cornstarch
1/4 ts Salt
4 ts Oil
1 ts Small chopped bamboo shoot
1 ts Chopped green onion
1/2 ts Soy sauce
1 ts Sesame oil
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Monosodium glutamate
(opt.)
1/4 ts Sugar
1 ts Cornstarch
1/2 c  Water
4 oz Dry shrimp
8 c  Oil for frying
For dough:  Mix the rice flour, sugar, and water.
Knead into a smooth dough.  Roll into a long roll and
cut into 20 pieces.

For filling:  Dice pork, mix with the rice win,
cornstarch, and salt. Heat pan and oil, stir-fry pork
mixture until color changes, remove and drain.  Reheat
oil and stir-fry the chopped bamboo shoot and green
onion until fragrant.

Mix the soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, pepper, MSG,
sugar, cornstarch, and water; add to bamboo shoots and
onions.  Bring to a boil, stirring, then add the pork
mixture and the dry shrimp; stir together, then remove
from heat; let cool.

Taking one of the dough pieces, flatten with the
palm on a hard surface.  Using tips of fingers, press
into a 2-inch flat circle; use a little oil on your
fingers if dough is very sticky.  Place a portion
(1/20th) of filling into the center of the dough
circle, fold in half and pinch edges to seal.  Repeat,
forming 20 meat-filled crescents.

Heat oil for frying in a large wok or kettle
until 350 to 375 degrees. Deep-fry half the dumplings
until they rise to the surface and are golden brown
and expanded, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove, drain, and
repeat procedure for remaining dumplings.

Makes 20.
