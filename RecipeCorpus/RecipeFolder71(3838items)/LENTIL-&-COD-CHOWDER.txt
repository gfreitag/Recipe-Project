Title: LENTIL & COD CHOWDER
Categories: None
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Dried lentils
1 lb Cod fillet, cut into 1"
-(2.5 cm) squares
Lots of diced vegetables
-(carrots, potatoes, onions,
-turnip, celery,
-green beans, tomatoes, ...)
1/4 c  Orange juice
2 tb Sunflower or green olive oil
1 tb Dried parsley
1    Bay leaf
1/4 ts Ground black pepper
1/4 ts Thyme
1/8 ts Tarragon
** Procedure  **

1) Place the lentils and 5 cups of cold water into a slow cooker
(about 4 quart or 4 litre size) or crock pot. Cook on low overnight.

2) At breakfast, add the spices, oil, and enough vegetables to fill
the pot to no closer than 8 cm (3 inches) below the top. Then add
enough cold water to cover everything, plus 1 cm (1/2 inch). Cook on
low for 5 hours.

3) Add the fish (the fish should be completely immersed in the
liquid), and then cook on low for another 4 to 5 hours.

4) A few minutes before serving, remove the bay leaf and mix in the
orange juice. Serve with salad and whole grain bread.

**  Variations  **
:

Substitute haddock, pollock, hake, cusk, clams, or lean back bacon
(diced) for some or all of the cod. Back bacon should be put in the
slow cooker in step #2, at the same time as the vegetables.

Note: Frozen fish should be thawed overnight in the refrigerator.
