Title: KAY'S FAVORITE MEAT LOAF
Categories: Diabetic, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Beef bouillion;
1/2 c  Boiling water
2 sl Bread; crumbled fine
1 1/2 lb 85% lean ground beef;
2 md Eggs; beaten slightly
1/2 c  Onion; chopped finely
1/4 c  Celery; chopped finely
2 ts Worcestershire sauce;
1 tb Catup
Preheat oven to 350 f degree.  Line a shallow 8-inch
baking pan with foil. Dissolve beef bouillion cube in
boiling water in a large bowl. Add all other
ingrediets except the catsup and blend well with a
fork. Turn onto foil in pan and, with hands, shape
quickly into a 6 by 4 1/2 inch by 2 inch loaf.  With
the dull edge of a knife make a crisscross pattern
across the top, spread with catup across the top.
Cover loaf with a tent of foil that does not touch the
top. Bake 45 minutes. Remove foil; bake, uncovered,
another 45 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool in pan
for 2-3 minutes before serving.  Using this molded
metheod instead of loaf pan allows the fat to drain
from the loaf, whereas a loaf pan retains fat.
