Pick over the lentils, then combine in a saucepan with the millet,
rice, and water.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until
cooked, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Lightly oil two
8-1/2 x  4-1/2 inch loaf pans.

Add the remaining loaf ingredients and mix well. Transfer mixture to
loaf pans and bake for 1 hour, or until lightly brown and the top is
dry to the touch.

Make gravy.  Place ingredient in a blender and liquify. In a medium
saute pan over medium heat, heat the gravy, stirring constantly,
until thick. Add more water if the gravy becomes too thick. Keep warm.
