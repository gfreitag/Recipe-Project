Title: MANGO-HABANERO SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Salsa
Yield: 20 Servings
2 tb Peanut Oil
8 ea Mangos-ripe-peeled-diced
1/2 c  White Onion-diced
1/2 c  Carrot-diced
2 ea Habanero chiles- seeded
1/2 c  Champagne Vinegar
1/2 c  Catsup
1/4 c  Sugar
Salt to taste
METHOD: This Salsa works well using either orange or green habanero.
Heat the oil in a saucepan and add the diced mangos, onion, carrot,
and habanero chilies. Cook for about 10 minutes over medium heat,
until onions are soft and translucent. This has natural sugar in it
so be careful not to scorch it. Deglaze with vinegar, and add the
catsup and sugar. Bring to a slow boil, reduce heat, and simmer for
35 to 45 minutes. This last step is done easily in a double boiler so
as not to scorch this sauce. Remove from heat and season with salt to
taste. Transfer to a blender, pulse sauce, and strain through a
medium strainer. If the sauce is to thick, add a little water to
thin. If blended carefully this may not need strained.
