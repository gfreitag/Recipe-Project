Title: LATTICE-TOPPED TURKEY PIE
Categories: Poultry, Casseroles
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Turkey; cooked, chopped
10 oz Peas
4 oz Cheese, cheddar, shredded
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
1/4 c  Onions, chopped
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper, black
1 c  Mayonnaise
1 cn Crescent dinner rolls
2 ts Seeds, sesame
Preheat oven to 350.  Combine first 8 ingredients; mix well. Spoon
into a 12"x8"x2" baking dish that has been sprayed with nonstick
coating. Separate crescent dough into rectangles; press perforations
to seal. Cut into 4 long strips and 4 short strips. Arrange strips in
lattice design across top of your casserole. Sprinkle with sesame
seeds. Bake 35 minutes. Garnish with radish slices and fresh parsley
sprigs, if desired.

Sylvia's comments: This was a big hit at our house -- only a little
strip was left along one edge of the casserole! I used nonfat
mayonnaise, and bet that nonfat yogurt would work just as well to cut
down on fat. I was out of peas, so used corn.  And I used leftover
chicken instead of turkey. Save this one for a neat way to use up
your leftover Thanksgiving turkey.
