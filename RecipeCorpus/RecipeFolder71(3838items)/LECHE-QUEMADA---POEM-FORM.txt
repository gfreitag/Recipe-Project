mama burns the milk in the black pan as she stirs brown sugar in
by hand
bringing it to a simmer humming a wordless tune which echoes
through the
room in rhythm with the stirrings of the wooden spoon adding in
droplets
of water like tears in the mixture to keep the pan from scalding

when she feels the thickness she pours the steaming liquid into
rows of
iron molds scorching her fingers as the steam comes back upon her
like
words in retribution but she continues in her motions until the
pan is
emptied

mama sits on a broken chair wiping the sweat dripping from her
hair as
the cool begins to harden the candies in their prison closing her
eyes
only for a moment before rising to put up the milk and sugar and
to wash
the cold dirtied pan to make room for evening dinner

as mama boils a pan of water she begins to hum the same wordless
tune
