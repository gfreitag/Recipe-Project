Title: LEBANESE  GARLIC  SAUCE
Categories: L, E, B, A, N
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Bulbs of garlic (clean off
Paper &
Stem)
1 c  Lemon juice
1 ts Salt
3    To 4 c. Puritan oil
Preparation : Put in blender (NOT a food processor) and blend until
smooth on medium. Add in an extremely slow stream, 3 to 4 cups of
Puritan oil. Blend constantly on about medium. It should become like
a thick white mayonnaise consistency.  Store in refrigerator in a
glass container. Serve with meats, as a seasoning in salad dressings
or on pocket bread sandwiches.  This is a tricky recipe. Sometimes it
"breaks". That is, it stays thin instead of the mayonnaise
consistency. The flavors remain the same. If it separates in storage,
just stir or blend again. (Sister-in-law of Jean Andrews)
