Title: MAPLE SYRUP PECAN PIE
Categories: Desserts, Pies
1    flaky pasty crust (single)
Yield: 8 Servings
3    eggs
1 c  light brown sugar -- packed
1 c  maple syrup -- pure
4 TB butter, unsalted -- melted
1/4 ts salt
1 ts vanilla extract
2 c  pecans -- coarsely chopped

Lightly grease a ten-inch pie pan and put the pie crust in.

Set the oven at 400 degrees to pre-heat.  Position a rack to the
middle.

In a bowl, beat the eggs until they are combined.  Add the sugar and
mix well.  Stir in the maple syrup, butter, salt, vanilla, and
pecans. Pour the filling into the pie crust and tranfer to the oven.

Bake the pie for 10 minutes.  Reduce the temparature to 350 and bake
for an additional 30-35 minutes or until the filling is set. Give the
pie a gentle shake; the center should remain firm.  Let the pie sit
at room temperature to cool completely.

To make in advance, wrap the cooled pie in plastic wrap, then in
heavy-duty aluminum foil.  Gently press the foil against the pie.
Freeze for up to two months.  Defrost the wrapped pie at room
temperature. Uncover the pie and warm in a 300-degree oven for ten
minutes before serving.
