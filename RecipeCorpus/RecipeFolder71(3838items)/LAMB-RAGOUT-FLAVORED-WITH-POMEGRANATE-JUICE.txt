Categories: Lamb, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Lean boneless lamb, cut in
-1-ounce chunks
1 tb Oil
1 lg Onion, chopped
1 ts Turmeric
1/2 ts Pepper
Salt
1 tb Flour
1/2 c  Ground or pulverized walnuts
1 c  Pomegranate juice
-(available in fancy food

1 ts Ground cardamom
Juice of 1 lemon
Without adding fat, brown the lamb chunks in a heavy Dutch oven. Heat
the oil in a separate pan and saute the onion in it until it is
brown, then transfer to the Dutch oven. Sprinkle the turmeric, pepper
and salt over the meat and stir for 1 minute.  Sprinkle in the flour
and stir until it is absorbed.  Add the walnuts, pomegranate juice
and enough water to almost cover the meat.  Reduce the heat to a
simmer, cover the pot and cook until the meat is tender, 1 to 1 1/2
hours. Add the cardamom. Squeeze in the lemon juice to taste and
adjust the salt. Keep warm until ready to serve.

Serves 6.
