Title: KEEBLER PECAN SANDIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Vegetable shortening
3/4 c  Granulated sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
2    Eggs
4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Baking soda
2 tb Water
1 c  Pecans -- shelled
1.  Preheat the oven to 325F degrees. 2.  In a large
bowl, cream together the shortening, sugar, and salt
with an electric mixer on medium speed. 3. Add the
eggs and beat well. 4. While mixing, slowly add the
flour, baking soda, and water. 5. Chop the pecans into
very small bits using a food processor or blender on
low speed. Be careful not to overchop; you don't want
to make pecan dust. The pieces should be about the
size of rice grains. 6.  Add the pecans to the dough
and knead with your hands until the pecans  are well
blended into the mixture. 7. Roll the dough into
1-inch balls and press flat with your hands onto
greased baking sheets. The cookies should be about 2
inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick. 8. Bake for 25
to 30 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are
golden brown.
