Title: LIVER LOAF
Categories: Meats, Appetizers
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Veal or pork stew meat
3/4 lb Liver
1/2 lb Bacon; diced
2    Eggs
4 tb Chopped fresh sage
2 tb Minced garlic
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 c  Dry white wine
Call this an American pate, if you like. Serve it with sour pickles,
brown mustard and pumpernickel bread. COMBINE ALL INGREDIENTS in a
glass bowl, cover and refrigerate overnight. The next day, grind the
mixture twice using a meat grinder fitted with a large die. Or pulse
until well combined, but not too smooth, in a food processor. Place
the mixture in a loaf pan, cover tightly, place the loaf pan in a
water bath, and place in preheated 375F oven until done, about 1 1/4
hours. Remove from the oven, unmold and serve immediately. Or place
the loaf under a 3-pound weight, let cool to room temperature and
then chill in refrigerator before serving.
