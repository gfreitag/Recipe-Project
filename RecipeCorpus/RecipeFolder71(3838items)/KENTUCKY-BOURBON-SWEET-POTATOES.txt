Title: KENTUCKY BOURBON SWEET POTATOES
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish, Christmas
Yield: 9 Servings
3 1/2 lb Canned, vacuum-packed sweet
Potatoes
1 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Bourbon
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
2 c  Miniature marshmallows
Fresh sweet potatoes, cooked until soft and then
peeled, can be substituted for the vacuum packed ones.
Don't use drained, canned in syrup as they are too
moist.

Preheat oven to 350.

Put sweet potatoes in a large heavy saucepan and cook
over medium heat, stirring frequently, until heated
through.

Mash sweet potatoes.  Add sugar, bourbon, butter and
vanilla; beat until well blended.  Turn into a
2-quart, shallow baking dish. Sprinkle marshmallows
over top.

Bake, uncovered, 30 minutes, or until marshmallows are
golden.
