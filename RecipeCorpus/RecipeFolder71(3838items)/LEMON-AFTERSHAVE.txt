The tangy tingling sensation it causes after being splashed on is one
way to describe an aftershave. Most aftershaves act as astringents;
they help firm skin tone and close skin pores when applied
immediately after shaving. Many aftershaves contain alcohol, which
possesses antibacterial abilities, helping to prevent infections of
knicks or shaving cuts. It also should contain glycerine and/or other
ingredients known to be beneficial to skin care. Glycerine will help
counter the drying effects on the skin, and the chafing and
irritation that can develop with dry skin.

*Most drug stores contain all of the above tinctures and oils. Herb
and health food shops carry the essential oils.

DaisyLin's comments: Here are some aftershave recipes that I have
used. My ex liked the lime one best. They are really good. I still
make it for him once in a while. And you can get neat bottles at a
healthfood or herb store, or some specialty stores...and the
essential oils can be found at a health food/herb store, and the
tinctures etc can be found at some pharmacies, I suggest calling
around. I found it at three old type pharmacies. Like Rexall.
