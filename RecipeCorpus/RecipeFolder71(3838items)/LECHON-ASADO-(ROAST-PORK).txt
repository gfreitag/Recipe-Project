in a big pan or dish (not aluminum), then sprinkle with pepper and
douse with sour orange juice and wine.   Scatter the onions over the

several times in the marinade. Heat oven to 350. Put the meat in a
roasting pan (not aluminum), save the marinade, and place in the
oven.   Cook for an hour, fat side down. Turn roast fat side up, add
marinade and onions, and reduce heat to 325; tent loosely with foil
if needed. Baste frequently with the pan juices and continue cooking
until done (30-35 min. to the pound++150 minimum; 180 very well
done). Add water or wine if drippings begin to smoke or burn. Let sit
before carving. Serve with Mojo Criollo.  Makes fabulous gravy! Cuban
