Title: LAMB LEG (3)
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-========
Ingredients:

Leg of lamb lot of garlic some ginger and rosemary a little soy sauce
Well Julia Child's method of butterflying the leg is best in my
opinion... Simply butterfly it (ie debone and cut large sections so
they flop open and the whole piece of meat lays flat ~1.5 2" thick).

Place dish or glass roasting pan to marinate with lotsa garlic (you
can never have too much garlic), some ginger, rosemary and I add a
little soy sauce. You may off course vary the spices to your liking.
Let sit for at least 2 hours.

And here's the best part you can broil it or grill it and it cooks (to
pink) in ~15  20 minutes..  Let sit for 10 mins after cooking and
slice down... Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40
