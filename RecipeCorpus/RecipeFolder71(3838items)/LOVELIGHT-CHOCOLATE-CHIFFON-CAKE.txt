1 ts Salt
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
1 c  Buttermilk; divided

1. To prepare the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour
two 9-inch cake pans; set aside.

2. In a large mixing bowl, beat egg whites until frothy, about 2
minutes. Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar and continue beating until
whites hold stiff peaks when the beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes.
Set aside.

3. In another large mixing bowl, sift together cake flour, remaining
1 cup sugar and the baking soda and salt. Add oil and 1/2 cup
buttermilk; beat for 1 minute, costantly scraping down the sides and
bottom of the bowl. Add remaining 1/2 cup buttermilk, the egg yolks
and melted chocolate. Beat 1 minute longer.

4. Gently fold the reserved meringue into the flour-buttermilk mixture
until combined (do not overmix). Pour batter into prepared pans.

5. Bake at 350 degrees until a wooden toothpick iserted in the center
of the cake comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes.

6. Remove pans to wire cooling racks and let cake cool in pans for 10
minutes. Remove cake from pans and cool completely on racks.

7. To make the frosting: In a medium mixing bowl, beat egg whites
until stiff enough to hold a point when the beaters are lifted, about
4    minutes.

8. Combine sugar, water and corn syrup in a medium-sized,
heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cover and bring to a rolling boil over high
heat. Uncover, and cook until the mixture measures 242 degrees on a
candy thermometer.

9. In a thin stream, slowly pour hot sugar syrup into the beaten egg
whites. Continue beating until stiff peaks form when the beaters are
lifted. Stir in vanilla.

10. Frost cake and serve.
