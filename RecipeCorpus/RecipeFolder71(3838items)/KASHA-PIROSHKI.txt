Kasha:  Beat the egg and mix with the groats, then place in a 300 F.
oven to dry.  When dried, break up the egg and buckwheat mixture with
a spoon and cover with boiling water.  Fry the onions in the oil and
add to the dried groats.

Pastry:  Boil and mash the potatoes, beat in the eggs and margarine.
Add enough flour to enable you to roll out the dough.  Roll out to
one-quarter inch thickness.  Cut into 16 squares and top each with a
spoonful of the groats mixture, bring the corners together and seal
all the edges. Brush with a little oil, or egg diluted with water,
and place edge-pinched side down in a greased pan.

Bake the piroshki in a 350 F. oven until they are golden, about 25
minutes.
