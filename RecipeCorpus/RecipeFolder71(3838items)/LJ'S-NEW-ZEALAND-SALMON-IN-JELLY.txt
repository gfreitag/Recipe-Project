Title: LJ'S NEW ZEALAND SALMON IN JELLY
Categories: Fish, Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
6 lb Fresh Salmon
6 tb Butter
3    Lemons
Salt
Pepper
Clean salmon and remove head, tail and fins. Cut the salmon into 1 lb
steaks (not fillets). Place 1 salmon steak onto a sheet of foil,
squeeze the juice of 1/2 a lemon, spread 1 tb of butter plus salt and
pepper on the salmon. Wrap the salmon steak tightly in the foil
(heavy duty) so as to make the best water tight seal as possible.
Repeat for each steak. Boil the packages in water for 20 minutes.
Remove and place in the freezer for an hour then refrigerate for 2
hours. When ready to serve, unwrap the salmon steaks carefully on a
large platter and cover with warm Hollandaise Sauce. To accompany the
salmon, this dish should be served with new baby potatoes which have
been boiled with mint leaves, and fresh garden peas, plus a palatable
white wine. This is a very basic but absolutely delicious recipe. Of
course, the fun is catching the salmon and telling the story of how
the large one snapped the rod like a pretzel and "got away"!
