optional.

1. Combine thawed orange juice concentrate (not regular orange
juice) in bowl along with the marjoram, garlic powder and nutmeg.
Split the chicken breasts to make 6 serving sizes. Dip each piece
into the orange juice to coat completely. Place in crockpot. Pour the
remaining orange juice mixture over the chicken.
2. Cover and cook on low for 7-9 hours, or cook on high for 4
hours if you wish. Precise cooking time is not important in crockpot
cooking.
3. When chicken is done, remove to serving platter. Pour the
sauce that remains in crockpot into a saucepan. Mix the cornstarch
and water and stir into the juice in pan. Cook over medium heat,
stirring constantly, until thick and bubbly. Serve the sauce over the
chicken.
