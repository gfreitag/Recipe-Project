Cook almonds and sugar over low heat in skillet, stirring constantly,
until sugar is melted, and almonds are coated. Warning, they will be
VERY HOT. Cool, and break apart. Store at room temperature.

Prepare and chill sweet-sour dressing recipe, by shaking all dressing
ingredients in a tightly covered jar. Refrigerate, until ready to
serve salad.

Tear greens into bite-size pieces. Place lettuce and romaine in
plastic bag; add celery and onions. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

When ready to serve, Pour sweet-sour dressing into bag, and add
drained orange segments. Close bag tightly and shake until salad
greens and orange segments are well coated. Add coated almonds,
shake, and serve.

Goes well with oriental dishes.  Greens can be stored in refrigerator
up to 24 hours. The coated almonds take a little time, but make the
recipe really special.

Variation: Pineapple salad: substitute 1 can pineapple chunks,
drained for the mandarin orange segments, and snipped mint leaves for
the parsley.
