Title: MALTED RYE BREAD ABM
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Servings
MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
1 1/4 c  Milk
1/2 tb Yeast
2 1/2 c  Bread flour
1 c  Rye flour
1/2 tb Salt
3/4 ts Cardamom, ground
1/4 c  Oil
1 tb Barley malt syrup
1/3 c  Honey
3    Eggs
Scald milk and let cool to room temperature.

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Since the flavor of this loaf is not too assertive, but the texture is
substantial, it is a good sandwich bread for spicy meats, such as
salami or pate, and ripe cheese. For early in the day eating, toast
and spread with orange marmalade or apple butter.
