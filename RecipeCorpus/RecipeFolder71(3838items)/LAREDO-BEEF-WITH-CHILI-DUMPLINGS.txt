Trim all fat from beef and cut into 1" cubes.  Shake meat with flour,
salt, chili powder, cumin and pepper in a paper bag to coat well. Add
beef cubes to oil, a few at a time, and brown. Stir in onion and
saute until soft. Drain liquids from corn and beans into a large
measuring container, add water, if needed,to make 3 cups. Stir into
beef mixture with beef bouillon cube and cover.  Heat to boiling;
lower heat and simmer for 2 hours or until beef is tender. Stir in
corn and beans; heat to boiling again. While vegetables heat, make
chili dumplings. Heat 1 tablespoon butter with chili powder in a
small saucepan until bubbly. In large bowl add milk and chili-butter
mix all at once and stir with a fork until evenly moist. Drop batter
by tablespoon on top of boiling stew to make 12 mounds. Cook
uncovered, 10 minutes. Cover. Cook 10 minutes longer or until
dumplings are fluffy-light.  Bette...NM Source:  *P Food Forum
