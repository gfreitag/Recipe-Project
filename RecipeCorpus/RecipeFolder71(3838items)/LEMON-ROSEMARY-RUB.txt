Title: LEMON-ROSEMARY RUB
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 ts Grated lemon peel
1 ts Crushed dry rosemary leaves
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Dried thyme leaves
1/4 ts Coarse ground black pepper
2 lg Garlic cloves -- minced
Combine all ingredients.  Use to season tender beef
steaks or roasts such as: sirloin, T-bone,
Porterhouse, tenderloin, rib eye, and top loin. This
recipe makes enough rub to season 2 pounds of beef.

Comments:  Rubs are applied to the exterior surface of the meat just
before grilling; they need no
standing time. However, for convenience, rubs may be
:
applied several hours in advance; the coated meat should be
refrigerated until grilling time. Flavors become more pronounced the
longer the rub is on the meat. You can create your own blend of
seasonings for rubs or use a commercial blend. Recipe Source: GREAT
