Title: LENTIL BURGERS (SATTERLY)
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  Dried red lentils
-Water, to cook
1 c  Bread crumbs
- (preferably wholewheat)
1 lg Onion; finely chopped
2    Garlic cloves; minced
- more to taste
Salt & pepper to taste
Wash lentils thoroughly & pick out any sticks & stones & grit which
might get in them.  In a large pot, bring the water to a rolling
boil. Add lentils & cook for 20-25 minutes until the lentils start to
puree. Drain & let cool. It is not necessary to let them get cold.

Transfer the cooked lentils to a large mixing bowl.
Add bread crumbs, garlic & onion & mix thoroughly. Season well.

You then can experiment with herbs & spices.  I usually add loads of
cajun spice, with healthy measures of parsley, basil & majoram. You
could try thyme or sage.  It is your choice.

If the mixture does not hold together well enough, add more bread
crumbs. Form into patties & then cook as you would a regular
hamburger in a little oil.  Or barbecue. If they are really dry, then
they hold together well enough to barbecue.

Serve in buns with old fashioned dijon mustard & chips ooops, errrr
fries.
