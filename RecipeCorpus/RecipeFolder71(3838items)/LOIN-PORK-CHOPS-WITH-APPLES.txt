Categories: French, Pork, Fruits, From cook4u
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Loin chops 1-in thick
2    Pinch of salt
1 tb Peanut oil
1    Clove, garlic
2    Apples,peeled,cored and 1/4d
1/4 c  Dry white wine
1/3 c  Chicken broth
1. Sprinke the chops with the salt. 2. Heat the oil in a heavy
skillet, large enough to hold both chops and apples - when they are
added - in one layer. 3. Add the chops and the garlic to the skillet
and brown well on one side, about 5 min. Turn and brown on the other
side, about 10 min. 4. Push the chops aside and add the apples in one
layer. Continue cooking 15 min., turning the apples so that they
brown and cook evenly. 5. Remove the chops and apples to a warm
serving dish. 6. Pour off the fat from the skillet. Add the wine,
stirring to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the bottom and
sides of the pan. Add the broth and simmer down to a saucelike
cocsistency. Discard the garlic. 7. Pour the sauce over the chops and
apples and serve. This great dish is named: Filets de porc aux pommes
