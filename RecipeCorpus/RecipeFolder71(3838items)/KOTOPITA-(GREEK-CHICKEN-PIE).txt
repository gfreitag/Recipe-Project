Categories: Greek, Poultry
Yield: 10 Servings
Karen Mintzias
1    Chicken, stewed
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
1/4 c  All-purpose flour
2 1/2 c  Chicken broth/stock; warmed
1/4 c  Milk, optional
3    Eggs; lightly beaten
3/4 c  Grated cheese *(see note)
Salt & freshly ground pepper
1 ts Grated nutmeg
Thyme or mint leaves;chopped
12    Commercial filo sheets
*Note: Suggested cheeses are either Mizithra or
Kefalotyri.  If unavailable, Parmesan or Romano could
be substituted.  :-(

Remove the bones and skin from chicken and discard.
With your fingers tear the chicken into strips, not
too small.  Set aside while you prepare the sauce.
Melt the 4 T butter in a heavy pan, then blend in the
flour, without scorching, over medium heat.  Remove
from the heat for a minute and stir in the warm broth,
then return to the heat and cook gently until the
sauce boils.  Cool.  Mix in the milk if the sauce
seems too thick, then add the eggs, cheese, a little
salt, pepper, nutmeg, and thyme.

Butter a 9 x 12 x 3-inch baking pan and in it spread 6
filo sheets, brushing each with melted butter.  Pour
in the chicken filling, then cover with the remaining
filo sheets.  Tuck the top filo over the bottom and
flute the edges.  Score the top 3 filo sheets with a
sharp knife.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 40
minutes, or until crisp and golden chestnut in color.
Remove from oven and let stand for 15 minutes before
cutting into 9 to 12 squares.  Serve warm.  (Serves 9
to 12)

Note: In Epirus, Kotopita is sometimes made with a
large amount of onions. If you would like to try it,
use the recipe above plus 1 pound of Spanish- type
onions.  Peel and slice the onions, boil in water for
5 minutes, and drain.  Prepare the sauce without the
cheese and bake the chicken and onions in the sauce,
between homemade filo, preferably, or commercial filo.
