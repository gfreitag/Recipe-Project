Title: LENTIL-CARROT LOAF
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
3 c  Carrots; cut into 1/3-inch
-slices
1 1/2 c  Lentils; cooked, drained
1/2 c  Onions; finely chopped
1/2 ts Sage
1 ts Curry powder
2 tb Shoyu or tamari
1 c  Rolled oats
1/2 c  Walnuts or pecans; chopped
2 tb Parsley; finely chopped
Steam the carrots until tender. Drain the carrots, and, if desired,
reserve the water to make a sauce to serve with the loaf.

Mix together the cooked carrots and lentils. Mash them coarsely with
a potato masher. Add the remaining ingredients and mix well.

Pack the mixture into a well-oiled loaf pan. Decorate the top of the
loaf with nut halves, if desired.

Bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes, or until firm and golden
brown.

After baking, let the loaf stand for about 5 minutes, and then
unmold it onto a serving platter. For an attractive presentation,
surround the unmolded loaf with sliced ripe tomatoes, or any other
colorful vegetable.

Serve with the sauce of your choice.
