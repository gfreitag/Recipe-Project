CAKE:

PREPARATION:  For The Cake, coat a 3-quart bundt or tube pan with 1
tablespoon of the butter and dust pan with 1 tablespoon of the flour.
Separate the eggs and set aside. Grate 2 teaspoons lemon zest and
squeeze 1/3 cup lemon juice.  Beat remaining butter and the sugar in
a bowl until the mixture is light and fluffy. Beat in egg yolks, one
at a time. Beat in lemon zest, lemon juice and yogurt. Sift remaining
flour with baking powder, bakinG soda and salt.  Turn mixer to low
and beat in dry ingredients until just incorporated. Turn mixer to
medium, beat for 2 minutes.  With clean beaters, whip whites to firm
peaks and fold into batter.  Pour batter into prepared pan.

COOKING:  Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to
350F. Bake until a cake tester inserted in the center of the cake
comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool cake in the pan for 10
minutes, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely. (Can wrap
and store at room temperature overnight, or freeze for up to 1 month.)

ASSEMBLY:  For The Glaze, sift confectioners' sugar into a medium
bowl or large measuring cup.  Squeze in 1 tablespoon lemon juice and
stir in yogurt until galze is smooth. With cake on a wire rack set
over a pan to catch drippings, pour glaze over the cake, allowing it
to drip down the sides. Let cake stand at room temperature until
glaze sets, about 10 minutes. (Can cover and store at room
temperature for up to 2 days.)

Makes 12 servings.
