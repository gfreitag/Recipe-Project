whirligigs, combine dry ingredients in a bowl; cut in shortening

form a stiff dough. Shape into a ball; place on a lightly floured
surface. Roll into a 12-inch by 6 inch rectangle.  Combine sugar,
butter and lemon peel; spread over dough. Roll up, jelly roll style,
starting at a long side. Cut into 10 slices; pat each slice slightly
to flatten. Place on top of berry mixture. Bake at 400 for 15 minutes
or unitl whirligigs are golden. Garnish servings with cream and
raspberries if desired.
