Title: KINGLY SMOKED SALMON
Categories: Seafood, Grill
Yield: 8 Servings
Pacific king salmon*
Alder wood for smoking
MMMMM----------------------------RUB---------------------------------
1/4 c  Dill, dried
1/4 c  Brown sugar
2 ts Kosher salt
2 ts Fresh-ground black pepper
MMMMM-----------------------MOP (OPTIONAL----------------------------
Remaining rub
1 c  Cider vinegar
1/4 c  Oil (canola or corn)
*butterflied tail section; or use coho or silver salmon

1. The night before you plan to barbecue, combine the
rub ingredients in a small bowl. Open the salmon flat
and massage it well with about 2/3 of the rub,
reserving the rest of the mixture. Fold the salmon
back into its original shape, place it in a plastic
bag, and refrigerate it overnight.

2. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the
temperature to 180' to 200' F.

3. Remove the salmon from the refrigerator and let it
sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.

4. If you plan to baste the fish, stir the remaining
rub together with the other mop ingredients in a small
saucepan and warm the mixture over low heat.

5. Transfer the salmon to the smoker skin side down,
placing the fish as far from the fire as possible.
Cook for 50 to 60 minutes, mopping it after 10 and 30
minutes in a wood-burning pit, or as appropriate for
your style of smoker. The salmon should flake easily
when done. Have a large spatula and a platter ready
when taking the salmon off the smoker, because it can
fall apart easily. Serve hot or chilled.

BBQ Tips: Alder remains the best wood for smoking
Pacific salmon. Alder chips are fairly common across
the country, but you may have more difficulty finding
the wood in chunks or logs. Fruit woods are the best
substitute, particularly when mixed with smaller
pieces of alder.
