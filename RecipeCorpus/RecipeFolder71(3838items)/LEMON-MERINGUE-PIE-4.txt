Title: LEMON MERINGUE PIE 4
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Pie
1    9 inch Pre-Baked Pie Shell
MMMMM------------------------THE FILLING-----------------------------
1 1/2 c  Granulated Sugar
6 tb Cornstarch
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Cold Water
1/2 c  Lemon Juice
3    Egg Yolks, Well Beaten
2 tb Butter
1 1/2 c  Boiling Water
1 ts Lemon Peel
MMMMM------------------------THE MERINGUE-----------------------------
2    Egg Whites, Whipped
1/4 ts Cream of Tartar
4 tb Confectioner's Sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. The Meringue: Whip the egg whites
until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and whip until stiff but not
dry. (The peaks should stand but should lean over slightly when the
beater is removed). Beat in the confectioner's sugar one tablespoon
at a time. DO NOT OVERBEAT! Beat in the vanilla. The Filling:
Thoroughly beat the egg yolks. Sift the sugar, cornstarch and salt
into a large saucepan. Gradually blend in the cold water and lemon
juice. When the mixture is smooth, blend in the egg yolks and butter.
Stirring constantly, add the boiling water. Bring the mixture to a
full boil, stirring gently. As the mixture thickens, reduce the heat
and allow to simmer very slowly for about a minute. Remove from the
heat and stir in the lemon peel. Pour the mixture into the pre-baked
pie shell. The Pie: Spread the meringue very thickly onto the pie
over the filling. Bake 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness
of the meringue.
