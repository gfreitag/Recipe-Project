all sides. Add saffron, water, and cinnamon stick; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, covered, for 1 1/2 hours.

pieces as large as possible; discard fat, gristle, and bones. Season
with salt and pepper. Skim fat from liquid, or refrigerate overnight
and remove fat. Refrigerate meat.

3. In a medium saute pan, heat 1 t butter and 1 t oil. Add sliced
onions and sprinkle with sugar and salt and pepper to taste. Cook
over medium-high heat for 15 minutes, tossing or stirring only when

brown, about zo more minutes.

4. Add tomatoes and cooking liquid from the lamb and bring to a boil.
Add meat, chick-peas, and pumpkin or squash and simmer, covered, for
15 minutes. Remove lid, stir in prunes, and simmer until thick, about
15 to 20 more minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve immediately
with harissa sauce and lavash or pita bread.
