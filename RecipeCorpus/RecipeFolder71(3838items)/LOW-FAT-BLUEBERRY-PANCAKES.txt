Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg Egg -- separated, keeping
2 c  Plain low-fat yogurt
1/2 c  Unsweetened applesauce
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
Whites of 3 large eggs(use
Saved white)
1/2 ts Vegetable oil
1 pt Blueberries -- rinsed &
Patted dry
Add yogurt, applesauce, sugar and vanilla to egg yolk. Stir with a
rubber spatula to mix, then stir in baking soda, salt and flour until
blended. Beat egg whites with an electric mixer until stiff peaks
form when beaters are lifted. Stir 1/3 the whites into the batter
until blended. Gently fold in remaining whites until no white streaks
remain.

Meanwhile heat griddle or large skillet over medium heat until a few
drops of water flicked onto the surface skitter around then
disappear. Wipe 1/2 tsp vegetable oil over cooking surface with a
paper towel (it may not be necessary to regrease surface). For each
pancake, pour 1/4 cup batter onto griddle or skillet, gently
spreading batter to make a 4-inch pancake. Quickly sprinkle some
berries on top, then cook 2 minutes longer or until bubbles appear on
surface of pancake and undersides are golden brown. Turn pancakes
over with a broad metal spatula and cook until tops bounce back when
touched, about 2minutes.
