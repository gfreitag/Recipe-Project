Title: MAKING JAM WITHOUT ADDED PECTIN
Categories: Jams, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Wash and rinse all fruits thoroughly before cooking. Do not soak. For
best flavor, use fully ripe fruit. Remove stems, skins, and pits from
fruit; cut into pieces and crush. For berries, remove stems and
blossoms and crush. Seedy berries may be put through a sieve or food
mill. Measure crushed fruit into large saucepan using the ingredient
quantities specified in Table 1.

Table 1. Ingredient Quantities.

Fruit: Apricots. Cups Crushed Fruit: 4 to 4-1/2. Cups Sugar: 4. Tbs.
Lemon Juice: 2. Yield (Half-pints): 5 to 6.

Fruit: Berries. Cups Crushed Fruit: 4. Cups Sugar: 4. Tbs. Lemon

Add sugar and bring to a boil while stirring rapidly and constantly.
Continue to boil until mixture thickens. Use one of the following
tests to determine when jams and jellies are ready to fill. Remember
to allow for thickening during cooling.

Temperature test: Use a jelly or candy thermometer and boil until
mixture reaches the temperature for your altitude. For more
information see "Making Jelly Without Added Pectin".

Sea Level: 220 degrees F.
1,000 ft: 218 degrees F.
2,000 ft: 216 degrees F.
3,000 ft: 214 degrees F.
4,000 ft: 212 degrees F.
5,000 ft: 211 degrees F.
6,000 ft: 209 degrees F.
7,000 ft: 207 degrees F.
8,000 ft: 205 degrees F.

Refrigerator test: Remove the jam mixture from the heat. Pour a small
amount of boiling jam on a cold plate and put it in the freezing
compartment of a refrigerator for a few minutes. If the mixture gels,
it is ready to fill.

Remove from heat and skim off foam quickly. Fill sterile jars with
jam. For more information see "Jars and Lids". Use a measuring cup or
ladle the jam through a wide-mouthed funnel, leaving 1/4-inch
headspace. Adjust lids and process.
