Good Seasons Italian or mild Italian salad dressing
mix preferred.

Mix salad dressing mix, flour, salt, lemon juice and
margarine to make a paste.  Spread paste evenly over
chicken. Stack in a bowl, cover and refrigerate at
least two hours or, better yet, over night.

About one hour before serving, heat about 1 1/2 pints
of oil in a heavy 9 i saucepan to 425 degrees.  Oil
should be about three inches deep.

Pour milk, club soda or beer in a deep, narrow bowl.
Dip each piece of chicken in the liquid, then dust
with pancake flour. Do not overcoat. Let pieces dry a
few minutes without touching each other. Fry a few
pieces at a time until coating is crisp.  Drain and
place on a cookie sheet one inch apart.  Bake,
uncovered, at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

NOTES:

Here is a recipe that I cut out of the newspaper years
ago. The heading wa "Getting close to the colonel's
secret recipe." The recipe is from the boo THE SECRET
RESTAURANT RECIPES BOOK. I never made it, so if you
try it let me know if it's worth the effort!!!
