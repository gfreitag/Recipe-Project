Categories: Salads, Pasta, Seafood, Dressings
Yield: 6 Servings
1 sm Cucumber; peeled & halved
-lengthwise (about 4")
1/8 ts Salt
1/2 c  Uncooked elbow macaroni
1    Pickled or matjes herring
-(2 fillets)
2    Mushrooms; raw, thin sliced
2 tb White vinegar
1 tb Olive oil
1 ts Salt
1/8 ts White pepper
MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
1 c  Sour cream
2 1/2 ts Curry powder
Scrape out and discard the seeds from the halved
cucumber with a teaspoon and slice the halves into
1/2" cubes. Place these cubes in a small bowl and
sprinkle with salt to draw out their excess moisture.
Let the cubes stand 15 minutes, then drain and pat
them dry with paper towels.
Cook the macaroni in rapidly boiling salted water for
20 minutes, following the directions on the package.
Meanwhile, wash the herring fillets in cold water, pat
them dry with paper towels and cut them into 1-1/2"
lengths. Drain the cooked macaroni in a colander, run
cold water over it to cool it, then spread out on
paper towels to get rid of any excess moisture.
Place the cut-up herring in a salad bowl along with
the cucumber, macaroni and sliced raw mushrooms. In a
separate bowl, beat together the vinegar, olive oil,
salt and pepper with a small wire whisk and pour this
mixture over the ingredients in the salad bowl. With 2
wooden spoons, mix the salad thoroughly but gently.
Refrigerate the salad for 1 to 2 hours before serving.
DRESSING: For a richer dressing, preferred by the
Danes, whip the mayonnaise,
sour cream and curry powder together in a small bowl
and add to the salad just before serving.
