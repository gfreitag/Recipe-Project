Title: MAMMA MARY'S PASTA E FAGIOLI
Categories: Soups, Pasta, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Garlic cloves; minced
2 tb Olive oil
1 cn Tomato sauce (8 oz)
1 c  Water
1 cn Cannellini beans (16 oz)
1/2 lb Ditalini or elbow macaroni
Fresh parsley; chopped
Cheese; grated
In a saucepan, fry the garlic gently in the oil until golden brown.
Add the tomato sauce and water, and let cook for 10 minutes. Add
beans, stir gently, continue to cook on simmer. Cook ditalini or
elbow macaroni al dente, drain and add to bean mixture.  Stir gently.
If it gets too thick, add a little more water.  Add parsley. Serve
immediately, or else the pasta will absorb all the liquid. This is so
good that I would double the recipe, because it is delicious when
sprinkled with grated cheese, with Italian bread dipped in the sauce.
Some people love it cold the next day, or you can add a little water
and warm it up. Enjoy! Serves 4.

VARIATIONS:  Omit the can of tomato sauce and it becomes a "white
sauce" utilizing the white bean juice. Pasta e Fagioli is great with
a sprinkle of crushed, dried hot pepper flakes.  ALTERNATIVE: Replace
cannellini beans with a can of chick peas, sweet peas, black eye peas
or lima beans - whatever matches your wallpaper best!
