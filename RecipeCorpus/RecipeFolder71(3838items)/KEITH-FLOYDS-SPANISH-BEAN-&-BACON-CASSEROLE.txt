Title: KEITH FLOYDS SPANISH BEAN & BACON CASSEROLE
Categories: Meat, Miscellaneo, Pulses and
E  *****
Yield: 1 Servings

Fry several rashers of bacon until they are crisp.
Drain and keep warm. Then get some good beef sausages
and fry them in the bacon fat. Cut them into slices
and keep warm with the bacon.

Now add some cooked, drained white haricot beans to
the casserole dish and heat the beans through using
the fat from the bacon and the sausages. Return the
bacon and sausage slices to the beans. Then add
**lots** of chopped fresh parsley and sliced fresh
garlic. Stir though and serve at once.

SOME NOTES. Lots of garlic and parsley means about 10
cloves of garlic and a huge handful of parsley chopped
up. Sometimes I will add fresh tomatoes, or maybe a
splurge of fresh tomato sauce, or maybe a nice splash
of Worchestershire sauce.
