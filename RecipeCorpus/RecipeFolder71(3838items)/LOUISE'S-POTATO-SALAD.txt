My potato salad
Yield: 1 Servings  :

9 new red potatoes,in bite sized pieces.  Wash well but leave
unpeeled. Take out little black dirt spots. 2 medium sized white
onions chopped small. (Buy flat onions, sweeter) 8 slices cooked and
crumbled bacon 1 whole package chopped fresh chives (1/2 cup chopped)
1 whole package fresh dill (about 1/2 cup chopped) DRESSING....make
separately 3/4 cup good mayonaise  (I use Best Foods) 3/4 cup sour
cream (low fat is okay) 3 eggs hardboiled 8 dashes of Worcestershire
sauce 1 level teaspoon Allspice
1/4    teaspoon chili powder
1/2    teaspoon dried dill 1 tablespoon dried chives Sweet
hungarian paprika to sprinkle over top

1. Prepare and cook the potatoes until just tender, drain & set aside
to cool. 2. Place the cooled potatoes in a large mixing bowl and add
the crumbled bacon, onions, fresh chives and fresh dill. 3. Mix the
mayo and sour cream in food processor or blender. Add the
Worcestershire, allspice and chili powder dried dill and dried
chives. Add the hardboiled eggs and whip together at high speed for a
fluffly dressing. Add freshly ground pepper and salt to taste. 4.
Fold into the potatoes. Put into a serving dish and sprinkle with
paprika. I serve lots of thinly sliced radishes around the side of
the dish.
