Here's Carole Rock's Killer Bread from Poppa Rock's
Family Cookbook - Also. Slice loaf in half
horizontally. Butter cut sides of both halves3 and
toast under broiler until lightly browned. Mix the
remaining ingredients and spread over both halves,
using the entire mixture. Bake at 400 deg. for 15 to
20 minutes, until top is brown and puffed. Cut into
wedges and serve hot. CAROLE'S NOTE: If fresh basil &
oregano are available it will really make a powerful
difference, but use triple the amount of each when
using fresh herbs. Margaret...this is one of the most
popular goodies we've had on the board. Carole's 2
Poppa Rock Cookbooks are full of superb goodies. FROM:
