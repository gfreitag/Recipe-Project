Title: KOLACHKI
Categories: Cookies, Russian, Holiday
Yield: 6 Dozen
MMMMM------------------------COOKIE DOUGH-----------------------------
1/2 lb Cream cheese
-(at room temperature)
1/2 lb Butter (at room
-temperature)
3 c  Flour
1 x  Walnut filling, below
-OR
12 oz Poppy seed filling
-(1 can)
MMMMM-----------------------WALNUT FILLING----------------------------
1 lb Walnuts, finely ground
1    Egg
1 c  Sugar
Water
Mix butter and cream cheese until smooth.  Add flour
and mix again until smooth.  Making this dough is easy
with a food processor, hard with a mixer.

Roll dough into 3 balls.  Refrigerate dough to keep it
from drying out. The dough can be refrigerated for 1-2
hours, but it is not necessary.  Roll out 1 ball at a
time and flour lightly. Roll dough out in flour or
granulated sugar so it doesn't stick.

Cut dough into squares or circles using cookie or
biscuit cutter.  Add about a teaspoon of filling. Roll
squares into "logs." Fold circles over and seal with a
fork. Bake at 375 degrees F. for 10-15 minutes or
until lightly browned.

MAKE FILLING:  Mix all ingredients together.  Add
water to obtain a sticky consistency.

NOTES:

*  Russian Cookies -- This recipe is from Mrs.
Malinch, my little sister's high school Russian
teacher.  I usually make this recipe at Christmas or
Easter.

My favorite fillings are poppy seed and walnut.  A
recipe for the walnut filling is included.  The poppy
seed filling can be found canned (Solo brand) in
either the gourmet or cake section of most grocery
stores. Yield: 6 dozen Kolachki.

*  The kolachki are delicate, so do not throw them in
a plastic bag or pile high in a jar as you would
cookies.  The kolachki can be frozen.
