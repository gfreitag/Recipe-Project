1 c  Whole Wheat Kernels
1/2 c  Poppy Seeds
1 c  Honey; (Clover Or Wild)
1/2 c  Walnuts; Chopped

Blanch the wheat with boiling water.  Cover and let
stand for about 1 hour.  Pour off the water, then add
enough cold water to cover about double, and cook,
covered, over low heat until the kernels are soft,
about 3 to 4 hours depending on the type of wheat.
Strain and allow to cool. Blanch the poppy seeds with
boiling water, allow to rest for 15 minutes, then
drain.  Add enough cold water to cover and reheat to
boiling.  Cook for a few minutes then drain the water
again.  Pour the seeds into a cotton towel and pat and
squeeze dry.  Then mash the seeds in a processor or
blender until mixture turns from slate to milky.
Combine the wheat, poppy seeds, and honey.  Taste and
season as needed with salt.  Add the chopped walnuts
and raisins.  The consistency should be semiliquid.
