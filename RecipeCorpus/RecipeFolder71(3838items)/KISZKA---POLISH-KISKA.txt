Title: KISZKA - POLISH KISKA
Categories: Cyberealm, Ethnic, Side dishes
Yield: 4 Lbs kiska
3 lb Pork steak
2 lb Coarse buckwheat grits
1/2 ts Rubbed marjoram
Salt and pepper
Chop meat into coarse bits. Cover with water and boil
until tender. Add salt, pepper and marjoram. Wash the
buckwheat grits, cover with the liquid from the cooked
meat, and steam in a double boiler for 1/2 hour.
Combine the two mixtures. If you have sausage casings,
stuff the mixture into the casings. It will keep very
well in a mold in the refrigerator. Heat before
serving.
