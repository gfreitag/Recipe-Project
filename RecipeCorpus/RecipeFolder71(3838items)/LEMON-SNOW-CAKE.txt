To make cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour
13-by-9-by-2-inch pan.

Sift cake flour with granulated sugar, baking powder and salt 3 times.
Place in large bowl. Add shortening, 1/2 cup of the milk, almond
extract, lemon extract and vanilla. Beat at medium speed of electric
mixer 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup milk and eggs. Beat 2 minutes.
Pour into pan.

Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out
clean. Cool 10 minutes before removing from pan. Place upside- down on
cooling rack. Cool completely. Split cake in half through the middle
to make two thin layers.

To make filling: Combine powdered sugar, shortening, evaporated milk,
butter flavoring, almond extract, lemon extract and vanilla in medium
bowl. Beat at high speed 5 minutes. Add marshmallow creme. Beat until
well-blended.

To make topping: Combine granulated sugar, cornstarch, salt, water,
egg yolks and lemon juice in small saucepan. Cook and stir on medium
heat until mixture comes to a boil and is thickened and clear. Remove
from heat. Add lemon zest, shortening, lemon extract and vinegar.
Blend well. Refrigerate until chilled.

To assemble: Reserve 1/2 cup filling. Spread remaining filling on
bottom cake layer. Cover with top cake layer. Spread reserved 1/2 cup
filling very thinly over top and sides of cake. Spread topping over
filling. Sprinkle with coconut, pressing coconut lightly against
sides. Refrigerate 30 minutes or longer.

Decorate with candy lemon drops, if desired. Refrigerate leftovers.
