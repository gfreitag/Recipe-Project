Preheat oven to 325F (165C). Line baking sheet with foil or waxed
paper; set aside. In a large bowl, beat egg whites and lemon juice
until stiff peaks form. While continuing to beat, gradually add
sugar. Fold in coconut or chopped nuts until mixture is evenly
blended. Drop mixture by teaspoonfuls onto lined baking sheets. Top
each cookie with a hazelnut. Bake 30 minutes. If cookie starts to
brown, slightly reduce the oven temperature. Cookies should not
brown. Remove cookies from baking sheet and place onto cooling racks.

stored longer than 1 to 2 days, add a lemon or apple wedge to the
container. This will keep the cookies from becoming hard. Makes
