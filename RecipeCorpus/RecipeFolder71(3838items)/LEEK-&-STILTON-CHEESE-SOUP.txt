Title: LEEK & STILTON CHEESE SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 8 Servings
1 lg Leek
1    Onion
2    To 4 oz Stilton cheese
-depending on taste
1    Vegetable Stock cube
4 oz Butter
4 oz Flour
3 pt Milk or single cream
Cut Leek into small dice along with onion. Melt butter in pan,add
Leek and Onion. Cook on low gaa for 10 min.. Add flour and mix very
well to form a thick paste. Add milk slowly. Stirring continuously,
simmer for 10 minutes. Add in Stilton(grated) and stock cube, then
liquidize.

Stilton is a very strong aged cheese. One could probably substitute
real Roquefert or its poor electrically aged cousin Blue Cheese and
it still would be wonderful.
