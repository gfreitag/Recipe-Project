Title: LOW SALT JERKY
Categories: Dehydrating, Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz LOW SALT soy sauce
4 tb Liquid smoke
Soak meat at least 2 hours, then place on trays. We like the pepper
jerky, so after placing on the trays I sprinkle coarse grind black
pepper on it, turn over and repeat to other side of meat.
