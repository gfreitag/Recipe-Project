Coarsely chop the mushrooms and strain the water though a double
thickness of dampened cheesecloth (or a coffee filter) into a clean
cup. Set both aside. In a large skillet, combine the garlic, onion,
and oil over moderate heat. As soon as the garlic begins to fry, add
the chopped dried mushrooms and stir in the reserved soaking water.
Cook until the water has completely evaporated. Add the fresh
mushrooms and salt and pepper to taste. Cover the skillet and cook,
stirring occasion ally, for 20-25 minutes. If too much liquid
remains, uncover and let some of it evaporate, but the mixture should
not be dry.
