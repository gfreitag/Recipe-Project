This is a recipe for a Czech barley casserole that is
traditionally served on Christmas Eve but is also good
as a side dish. Cook the onion in the butter until
translucent. Wash the mushrooms until free from grit.
Add the barley (or barley grits, mushrooms, salt and
water to the onions and cook, uncovered, until the
water has evaporated, stirring frequently. (Mixture
will be very thick.) Add the remaining ingredients.
Place in a greased casserole or baking dish and bake
at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes. I usually cut
this recipe in half unless we are having a really big
crowd. It also freezes well.
