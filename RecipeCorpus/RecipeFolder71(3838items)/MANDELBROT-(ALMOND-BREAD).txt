Title: MANDELBROT (ALMOND BREAD)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 18 Servings
3    Eggs
1/3 c  Sugar
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/4 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/3 c  Chopped blanched almonds
2 ts Ground cinnamon (less needed
Beat the eggs and sugar together until thick.  Add the oil and
vanilla and mix well.  Stir in the flour, baking powder and almonds.
Pour the batter into a lightly oiled and floured 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf
pan just to cover the bottom of the pan.

Sprinkle on the cinnamon.  Add another layer of batter and cinnamon.
Continue until all the batter and cinnamon are used.

Bake in 350 F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Bread
will be dense.  Remove from the pan and cool on a wire rack. Cut into
1/2 inch slices when ready to serve. Place each slice on a lightly
oiled baking sheet and toast in a 400 F oven for 5 to 6 minutes. (My
note - warm briefly in microwave.)
