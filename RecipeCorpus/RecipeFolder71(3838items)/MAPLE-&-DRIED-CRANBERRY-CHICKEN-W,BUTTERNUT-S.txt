Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Butternut squash
1 lg Onion, chopped
3 oz Swiss cheese, grated
1 ts Chopped parsley
1 ts Chopped chives
1/2 c  Butter
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Risotto rice
1/2 c  White wine
2 c  Chicken stock
1 1/2 lb Chicken breast, boneless,
-skinless, quartered
1/4 c  Maple syrup
1/8 c  Dried cranberries
Peel and grate the butternut squash. Melt half the butter in a
skillet and saute the squash and half the onion together until
translucent. Stir in the cheese, parsley, and chives. Set aside. Heat
the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute the remaining
onion. Add the rice and wine, stirring constantly. Reduce. Add one
and a half cups of the chicken stock, one-half cup at a time,
stirring until absorbed. The rice is done when still slightly
crunchy. Combine with the squash mixture. Fry the chicken breasts in
the remaining butter a few minutes on each side. Add the maples
syrup, cranberries, and remaining chicken stock. Cook for a few
minutes over low heat, or until the sauce is slightly reduced. Serve
over the squash risotto.

At the Casino of Montreal, chef Jean Pierre Curtat mixes typical
Quebec ingredients like dried cranberries and maple syrup to
main-course dishes. In this recipe, I've substituted chicken breast
for veal sweetbreads.
