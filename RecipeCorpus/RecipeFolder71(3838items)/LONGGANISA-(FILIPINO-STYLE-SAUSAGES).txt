Title: LONGGANISA (FILIPINO-STYLE SAUSAGES)
Categories: Filipino
Yield: 1 Servings
Mixture of 30% ground beef
And 70% ground pork
For every 2.2 pounds (1 kilo
Mixture add:
2 1/2 tb Salt
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Vinegar
2 tb Wine
1/8 ts Saltpeter; (salitre)
1 ts Ground pepper
2 ts Chopped garlic
Sausage casings
Available any butcher shop
Mix all ingredients together and cure mixture for 5-6 days in the
refrigerator and stuff into casings. This kind of sausage should be
stored in a cooler, ready for use. To cook: Place a small amount of
water in a skillet. Place sausages and let boil in water for about 10
minutes. With a fork, pierce casings. The Longganisa will be ready
when juices flow out and turn a dark caramel color. The sausages
should also turn the same color and some oil should leak out.
Suggestions: You can eat the Longganisa and tapa with pieces of
lightly salted tomatoes. This will make a perfect compliment to the
sinangag.
