mixture, smooshed together with your hands well and smoothed over the
bottom. Next the carrots, if you use them. Next, the cabbage. Before
adding sauce, combine all sauce ingredients together, then pour over
the top. With a knife, dig into the cabbage to allow the sauce to go
thru to the meat layer. Bake in a very slow oven 300 or a little

to add a bit of water here and there. Do not stir so that you don't
break up the meat layer.
