The story:

This speciality is the "gourmand cake" of the St. Nicholas Festival
celebrated annually on 6th December. Presided over by the Bishop of
Myra, the feast day assumes an air of solemnity in Lucerne itself,
culminating in a procession through the town. "St. Nicholas" is
preceded by two heralds and is escorted by frightening "Schmutzli"
(large puppets) who, according to tradition, are thought to punish
children who have misbehaved during the year. Only well behaved
children receive presents from St. Nicholas on this special day.

The recipe:

Whip the cream and mix with molasses (1), spices and salt. Add the
baking powder, flour, warm milk and diced peel, mixing throughly
until smooth.

Pour the mixture into a greased and lined sponge ring and bake for
45-50 minutes at 180 oC.

When baked, brush the top with the pear molasses (2) to glaze.

Recommended drink: tea or coffee.
