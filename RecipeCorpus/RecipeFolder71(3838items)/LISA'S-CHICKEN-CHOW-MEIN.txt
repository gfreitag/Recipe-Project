:
1/3 c  soy sauce
1 TB oyster sauce
1 TB black bean paste**
1 pn sugar

* Optional **If possible, try to get the authentic kind sold in
Chinese or Korean markets. These have the best flavor. But if all you
can get a hold of is the supermarket variety, that's all right. Or it
can be omitted altogether, if there is none to be had in your area.
1. Cook the noodles in boiling water until done. Drain. 2. Marinade
the meat in soy sauce, rice wine, and cornstartch for at least 30
minutes. 3. In a measuring cup, mix together the soy sauce, oyster
sauce, black bean paste, and sugar. Set aside. 4. Heat a large wok on
high. When the wok is smoking add the oil. Stir fry the vegetables
briefly, in batches if necessary, and transfer to a bowl. 5. Reheat
the wok and add more oil. Add the marinated chicken and stir fry
until the meat is cooked. Add the soy sauce mixture in step 3 and
cook until boiling. 6. Add the noodles and vegetables to wok and toss
well to coat. Take off the heat. Note: It is important to have a good
heat source to achieve good results in chinese cooking. I have found
that ordinary  kitchen stoves leave something to be desired when the
recipe calls for stir frying over high heat. If possible, use an
outdoor cooking device, such as propane gas stoves designed for
outdoor cooking. (use it outdoors, of course!)
