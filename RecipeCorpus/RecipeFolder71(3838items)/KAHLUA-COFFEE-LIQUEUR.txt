Title: KAHLUA COFFEE LIQUEUR
Categories: Beverages
1    liquor bottle w/top
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  80 proof Vodka
2 c  Water
1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1 1/2 TB Vanilla extract
1 1/2 TB Instant coffee

Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan. Cover
and cook over medium heat, tirring occasionally, until
the sugar has completely dissolved. Remove the mixture
from the heat and let it cool. BE Sure to keep it
covered. Store in any empty 750 ml liquor bottle with
a screw top or another bottle with a resealable lid.
It is very important that you use a covered saucepan
when making this  drink. The alcohol will boil away if
the solution is not covered when it  gets hot. Also
the longer this drink is bottled and stored in a dark,
cool, place the better it will taste. For the bet
flavor, store it for at least 30 days before drinking.
Probably the hardest part of making this simple
receipe is not drinking it before it matures.
