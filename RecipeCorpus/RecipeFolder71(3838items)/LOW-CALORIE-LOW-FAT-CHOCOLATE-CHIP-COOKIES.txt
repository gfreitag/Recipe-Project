NOTES:

These cookies are great.  They are very sweet though. I've only used
an egg white when I've made these. Also, the dough is kind of
crumbly. I ended up kind of forming them with a spoon and my hands
into little balls. My experience was that they only took about 8
minutes to bake. I let them cool on the sheets for about 5 minutes
before easily moving them to cooling racks.  The dough makes them
look like they're not going to turn out, but I was pleasantly
surprised the first time I made them. You won't be able to tell that
they're low calorie and low fat. ENJOY! Let me know if you like them.
