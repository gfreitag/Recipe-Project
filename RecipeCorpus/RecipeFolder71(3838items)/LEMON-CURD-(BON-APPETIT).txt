Title: LEMON CURD (BON APPETIT)
Categories: Spreads, Pies, Canning, Fruits
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  (1 stick) butter
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/4 c  Strained fresh lemon juice
4    Eggs
2 tb Grated lemon zest
This versatile sauce is delicious spread on English muffins, makes a
wonderful cake or pie filling and is also an easy way to enhance plain
yogurt.  It has a tendency to darken after about 2 months, so it is
best to make only what you can use within that length of time.

Makes about 4 1/2-pint jars

Melt butter in top of double boiler over simmering water. Add
remaining ingredients and blend well. Continue cooking, stirring
frequently, until thick and smooth, about 25 to 30 minutes. Ladle
into sterilized jars and seal with lids.
