2 lb Chicken, cut up

1 md Onion, chopped
5 cl Garlic, minced
3 tb Curry paste (see below)
Salt to taste
1/2 tb Chili powder
1/2 c  Yogurt
2 lg Tomatoes, chopped
Madras Curry Paste
Makes 1 1/2 cups
1/2 c  Ground coriander
1/4 c  Ground cumin
1 ts Black pepper
1 ts Tumeric
1 ts Dry mustard
1/2 tb Chili powder

2 ts Crushed garlic

Salt to taste
Dust chicken pieces with flour. Heat oil in large saute pan until
very hot. Cook chicken until browned. Remove chicken. Saute onion and
garlic until tender. Add curry paste, salt, chili powder. Stir in
yogurt and tomatoes. Add chicken back in and coat well with sauce.
Reduce heat to simmer, cover and cook 30-40 minutes. Serve over rice
(make two cups) with the following condiments: raisins, sliced
bananas, chopped tomatoes, shredded coconut, chopped green onions,
chopped peanuts and chutney. For the chutney, I use the
mango/habanero Island sauce from "Hot Licks". The one with rum in it.

Madras Curry Paste makes 1 1/2 cups

Mix dry spices in a bowl. Add garlic, ginger and enough vinegar to
make a smooth puree. Heat oil in sauce pan until hot and add spice
mixture. Reduce heat stirring constantly until oil starts to separate
from the spices. Allow to cool and remove excess oil. Place in glass
jar and store refrigerated. Keeps forever. Walt MM
