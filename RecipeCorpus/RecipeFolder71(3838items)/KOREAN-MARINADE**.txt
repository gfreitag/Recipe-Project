Title: KOREAN MARINADE**
Categories: Bar-b-q, Marinades
Yield: 6 Servings
3 tb Sugar
2 tb Sesame oil
6 tb Soy sauce
1    Green onion, chopped
1    Clove garlic, minced
1 ds Pepper
2 tb Toasted sesame seeds*
1 tb Flour
Mix all ingredients together.  Marinade for at least
1/2 hour or overnight at maximum.  Baste meat with
marinade while cooking.

This is enough marinade for approximately 2 lbs. meat.
It can be used on beef, ribs, chicken etc.  My
preference is on beef short ribs or a good porterhouse
steak.

* = can usually be found in the ethnic section of any
supermarket or in a Chinese market etc.
