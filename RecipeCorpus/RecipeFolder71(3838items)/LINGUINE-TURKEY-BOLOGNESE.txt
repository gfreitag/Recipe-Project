To lighten a traditional Bolognese sauce, I substituted lean ground
turkey for the more traditional ground beef. It's necessary to taste
and adjust seasonings as you go along, since the flavor of turkey is
not as strong as beef. I've added a generous amount of oregano and
garlic for spice and sauteed the meat in extra-virgin olive oil for
more flavor. Have patience with this sauce - the long, slow simmer is
what makes it so delicious. Freshly grated Parmesan is perfect to
serve alongside.

1. Place oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add the
celery, carrot, onion and garlic, then cook 8-10 minutes, stirring
occasionally.

2. Raise heat to medium and add the ground turkey and oregano. Cook
for about 8 minutes, stirring and breaking up the meat, until it
begins to brown.

3. Add the wine and simmer for about 10-12 minutes. Add the
half-and-half and simmer until nearly reduced, about 6-8 minutes.

4. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste and broth. Bring to a gentle simmer
and cook over medium-low heat, partially covered, for 1 hour,
stirring a few times. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

5. Serve hot over just-cooked linguine and sprinkle with chopped
parsley.
