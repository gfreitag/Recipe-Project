Title: KEN'S CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD
Categories: Salads, Oriental, Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Plain roasted chicken
-(about 2 1/2 lb)
8 oz Fresh bean sprouts
2 md Cucumbers
1    Carrots (or double amount)
MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
3 tb Sesame paste
-or peanut butter
2 tb Finely chopped scallions
2 ts Sesame oil
2 tb Chinese white rice vinegar
-=OR=- cider vinegar
3 tb Light soy sauce
1 1/2 tb Finely chopped garlic
1 ts Salt
2 ts Sugar
2/3 c  Chicken stock
1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
TRIM THE BEAN SPROUTS at both ends. Peel the cucumber,
split it in half lengthwise and remove the seeds with
a teaspoon. Finely shred the cucumber into 3-inch
lengths. Peel and finely shred the carrots into 3-inch
lengths. Set the vegetables aside. Take all the meat
off the cooked chicken and shred it into fine strips
using a sharp knife or cleaver. Arrange the chicken
strips on a platter and surround them with the bean
sprouts, cucumbers and carrots. Combine all the
ingredients for the dressing and mix them thoroughly.
(I find an electric blender is useful for this, but
you could use a screw-top jar and shake everything in
it well.) Pour the dressing all over the chicken and
vegetables and mix well. Serve at once.
