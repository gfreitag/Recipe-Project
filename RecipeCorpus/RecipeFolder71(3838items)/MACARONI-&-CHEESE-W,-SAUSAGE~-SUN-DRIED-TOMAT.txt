-to taste
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease a 1-1/2 quart casserole
with oil spray.
Cook sausage in a pan over medium-high heat.  Drain off grease.
Stir in optional chile paste.
Cover tomatoes with water in a microwave-safe dish and nuke on high
until softened--about 2 minutes. Drain off liquid and mince tomatoes.
Put the cooked macaroni, sausage, tomatoes and basil into the
casserole. Pour the cheese sauce over it and mix gently with a fork.
Spread the crumbs over the cheese and spray top with vegetable oil.
Bake, uncovered, until the top is browned and the sauce is bubbling,
about 30 minutes.
CHEESE SAUCE: Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir in
the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until bubbly but not
brown--about 2 minutes.  Add the hot milk, continuing to stir as the
sauce thickens.
Bring to a boil.  Add salt and pepper to taste, lower the heat and
whisk in cheese.  Cook, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes more. Serves 4.
