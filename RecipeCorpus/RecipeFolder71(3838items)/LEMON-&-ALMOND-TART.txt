Title: LEMON & ALMOND TART
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Sugar
2 oz Almond paste (1/4 cup)
6 ts Chilled butter
1    Egg yolk
LEMON FILLING:
2 md Lemons
4 tb Butter
2    Eggs
1/4 c  Sour cream
3/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Confectioners' sugar
ALMOND PASTRY:

PREPARATION AND COOKING:  For The Pastry, adjust the oven rack to low
position and heat the oven to 350F. Put the flour, salt, sugar and
almond paste in the workbowl of a food processor fitted with a metal
blade, or into a medium bowl.  Pulse the mixture, or work it with
your fingertips, until it resembles coarse meal. Cut the butter into
1-inch pieces. Pulse, or work, until the mixture again resembles
coarse meal. Add the egg yolk and pulse, or toss with a fork, until
dough holds together when pinched.

Press the dough evenly over the bottom and up the side of a 9-inch
tart pan with a removable bottom.  (Can wrap the crust in the pan and
freeze for up to 2 days; defrost before baking.) Transfer the tart
pan to a baking sheet and bake until the crust is golden brown, about
20 minutes.

For The Filling, grate 2 teaspoons of lemon zest and squeeze 1/3 cup
of lemon juice into a medium bowl. Melt the butter and whisk it into
the bowl along with the eggs, sour cream and sugar. Pour the filling
into the pre-baked crust and return the pan to the oven, baking until
set, 12 to 15 minutes.  Transfer the tart, in the pan, to a wire rack
and cool to room temperature.  (Can cover and refrigerate overnight.)

SERVING:  Dust lightly with confectioners' sugar and serve at room
temperature.

Makes 8 servings.
