Title: KOCHU JANG (HOT SAUCE)
Categories: Condiments, Korean
Yield: 4 Gallons
7 1/2 c  Glutinous rice powder
5 1/2 c  Chili powder
5 1/2 c  Salt
4 c  Yeodkireum powder
- (dried barley sprout malt)
2 c  Meju powder (soy bean malt)*
8 1/3 c  Water
* NOTE: Available in Korean markets. Consists of soy
beans which are made into dumplings, fermented, dried,
and then powdered. In a bowl, combine YEODKIREUM
powder and water.   Mix well, then strain off liquid
into a large pot.  Add glutenous rice powder to liquid
and mix well. Cook over low heat (113F, 45C).  Remove
from heat and allow to stand until rice powder is
dissolved. Heat to boiling, then reduce heat and let
cook for 30 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl to cool.
When completely cool, stir in MEJU and chili powder
and blend well.  Leave overnight. The next day, mix in
4 cups of the salt and transfer mixture to a large
container.  Sprinkle remaining salt over, then cover
with loosely woven cloth such as cheesecloth or gauze.
Leave in a sunny place to ferment, stirring
occasionally, for one month. ADDITIONAL NOTES: Use a
large container, as mixture rises as it ferments.
During fermentation, cover container at night.
