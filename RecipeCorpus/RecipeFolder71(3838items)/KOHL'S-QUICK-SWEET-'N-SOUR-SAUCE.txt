Title: KOHL'S QUICK SWEET 'N SOUR SAUCE
Categories: Improv, Kohl, Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
Heinz Cocktail sauce
Honey
Lemon
You'll have to guess at this and make it to your
personal taste. I
usually dump about a 1/2 cup sauce into a small
individual serving
bowl, add about 3 tablespoons honey and about 1
tablespoon lemon juice.
