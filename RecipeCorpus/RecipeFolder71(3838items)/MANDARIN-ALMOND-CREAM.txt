-unflavored gelatin
1 qt 2% milk
1/3 c  NutraSweet Spoonful
1/4    To 1/2 teaspoon almond
-extract
20 oz Mandarin orange segments,

As luscious as its name sounds, this oriental-inspired dessert is the
smooth, creamy kind everyone has room for.

SPRINKLE GELATIN over milk in medium saucepan; let stand 2 to 3
minutes. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until
gelatin is dissolved. Remove from heat; stir in NutraSweet Spoon- ful
and almond extract.

POUR MIXTURE into serving bowl; refrigerate until mixture is the
consistency of unbeaten egg whites, about 1 hour. Stir in oranges.
Refrigerate until custard is set, 2 to 3 hours. Spoon into individual
dishes.

NOTE: After stirring oranges into the custard, the mixture can be
spooned into individual dishes or stemmed goblets; refrigerate as
above. Sweet cherries, peach slices, or other fruit can be
substituted for the oranges.
