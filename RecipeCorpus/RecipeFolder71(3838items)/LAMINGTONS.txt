Place the cake in the refrigerator or freezer for about 1/2 hour or so
before icing.  Cut into squares. Sift icing sugar and cocoa together.
Make into a smooth icing with boiling water, butter and vanilla.
Pierce squares of cake with a fork and dip into chocolate icing for a
few seconds, then toss into the coconut. If the icing becomes a
little thick, heat over hot water or add a drop or two extra hot
water to the icing. Best if allowed to mature in a sealed container
for several hours before serving.

Butter cake:  Line a greased Lamington tin with greaseproof paper.
Cream butter, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs,
one at a time. Fold in flour and milk alternately and beat well.
Spread into prepared tin. Bake in a moderate oven for 30-35 minutes.
Allow to stand for a few minutes, then turn out onto a cooler (a
rack?).

Sponge: Line a lamington tin with greaseproof paper. Beat egg whites
until stiff, then gradually beat in sugar. Fold in yolks, then add
sifted flour and cornstarch. Dissolve butter in boiling water and
fold through. Pour into the prepared tin and bake in a moderate oven
for 20 minutes. Allow to stand for a few minutes, then turn out onto
a cooler.

Note: A Lamington tin measures 28 x 20 cm (11 x 8 inches) and 3 cm (1
1/2 inches) deep.
