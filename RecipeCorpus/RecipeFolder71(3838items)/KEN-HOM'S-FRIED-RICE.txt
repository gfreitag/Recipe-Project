2 oz Chinese barbecued pork;
- cut into fine dice
1/4 lb Fresh or frozen peas;
- blanched 5 or 2 minutes
2 ea Tb Oil; preferably peanut
2 c  Long-grain rice; steamed and
- chilled
1 ts Salt
2 ea Eggs; beaten
4 oz Fresh bean sprouts; about
- 1 cup
GARNISH
2 ea Tb Scallions; finely chopped
Drain peas in a colander. Heat a wok or large skillet
until it is hot. Then add the oil and wait until it is
almost smoking. Add the cooked rice and stir-fry it
for 1 minute, and then add the barbecued pork, peas
and salt. Continue to stir-fry the mixture for 5
minutes over high heat. Next add the beaten eggs and
bean sprouts and continue to stir-fry for 2 minutes or
until the eggs have set. Turn the mixture onto a plate
and garnish it with the scallions. Serve at once, or
let it cool and serve as a cold rice salad. Here are
some hints for fried rice. The cooked rice should be
cool. Never put soy sauce into fried rice. Don't
precook the egg. And, be sure the oil is hot enough to
not saturate the rice.
