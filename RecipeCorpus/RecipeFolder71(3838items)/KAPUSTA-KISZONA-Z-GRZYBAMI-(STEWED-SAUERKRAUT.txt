Title: KAPUSTA KISZONA Z GRZYBAMI (STEWED SAUERKRAUT
Categories: Vegetables, Polish
Yield: 6 Servings
1 oz Mushrooms, dried
-(or use 1/4 lb
-fresh mushrooms)
1/2 c  ;Water, warm
1 lg Onion
2 1/2 tb Butter
1 1/2 lb Sauerkraut; rinsed/drained
1/3 c  ;Water
2 tb Flour
Salt and pepper
Soak the dried mushrooms in 1/2 cup of warm water for
1 hour.  Saut# mushrooms and onion in butter in a
skillet 3 minutes.  Add sauerkraut to mushrooms; cook
and stir for 10 minutes.  Blend 1/3 cup water into
flour. Mix with sauerkraut and simmer for 15 minutes.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.

I usually like to add 1/4 cup of dark rum after
cooking.  That reminds me of the recipe I have for
*bigos* (similar in construction but with more
ingredients).

Original recipe passed down through the generations and
translated from Polish into English (with a few mods)
