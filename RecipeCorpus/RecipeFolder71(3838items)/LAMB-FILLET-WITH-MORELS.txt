This looks pretty tasty++lamb fillets stuffed with minced chicken and
served with potato pancakes.  The presentation looks like something
seen through a kaleidoscope++overlapping triangles formed by the
three lamb fillets, the potato pancakes, the morels and the sauces.
Here again, I believe that "shallots" are in reality scallions. The
"pork net" is more than likely a web of caul fat.

To prepare: 1. Soak morels over night in cold water and wash
thoroughly Discard stalks. 2.  Cut off and discard lamb fillet's
stringy part. Season fillet with salt and pepper. Using barbecue
skewers, pierce through fillet lengthways, stretching meat apart
slightly to form a central hole about 1.5 cms wide. Stuff chicken
force meat into hole (one way is to use a piping or icing bag). 3. To
make port wine sauce: either make a beef stock which includes sauteed
mixed vegetables, herbs (rosemary, thyme and black pepper) and tomato
paste, or liquefy the contents of a gravy sauce packet to produce a
thick 1/3 cup of gravy.  Add port wine, maintaining a thick
consistency. Keep warm. 4. To make chive cream sauce: saute chopped
shallots in a little oil, add Madeira wine, few drops of white wine,
and chicken stock.  Boil until thick, then add cream. Strain and add
chopped chives, pinch of sugar, and salt and pepper according to
taste. Keep warm. 5. Make 12 small golden-brown potato pancakes. Keep
warm.

To cook: 1. Saute morels in butter, with seasoning (salt, pepper and
chicken stock, according to taste) for 2 to 3 minutes. 2. Lightly
blanch broccoli florets, then discard stalks. Saute florets in butter
with seasoning (salt, pepper and chicken stock, according to taste)
for 1 to 2 minutes. 3.  Cut stalks off lettuce and blanch leaves.
Wrap one layer of lettuce leaves around stuffed lamb.  Then wrap it
completely with sheet of pork net, folding net over the ends to
enclose them. 4. Pan-fry stuffed lamb in melted butter (a
soupspoonful) over a low flame for approximately 5 minutes until
lightly browned. 5. Remove lamb to a roasting dish and roast in its
own juices in an oven (250F) for 20 to 25 minutes, turning it every 4
or 5 minutes. 6.  When lamb is cooled, remove from oven, and
carefully take off pork net wrapping. Slice the lettuce-wrapped
fillet into 12 portions.

To present: 1. Dress centre of each plate with a large spoonful of
chive cream sauce. 2.  Spoon out three separate portions of port wine
sauce so that they touch the chive cream sauce. 3. Lay lamb slices
sideways on port wine sauce. 4.  Place three potato pancakes in
spaces between lamb slices and lay a broccoli floret on each pancake.
5. Garnish chive cream sauce with morels and a central heap of diced
tomato. Scatter a few specks of truffle over each lamb slice, and a
sprinkling of chopped chives over central garnish display.
