Title: LEMON LOAF
Categories: Muffins, Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Lemon
2 1/4 c  Flour, all-purpose
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
3/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Butter
3    Eggs
3/4 c  Milk
2 tb Sugar
From lemon, grate 1 tablespoon peel and squeeze 4 1/2 teaspoons lemon
juice; set aside.

In large bowl with fork, mix flour, baking powder, salt and 1 1/2 cups
sugar.  Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in
peel.

In small bowl with fork, beat eggs slightly and stir in milk; then
stir this mixture into flour mixture just until flour is moistened.

Spoon into greased loaf pan.  Bake at 350F for 1 1/4 hours. Cool in
pan on wire rack 10 minutes; remove from pan.

Heat lemon juice over medium-high heat, stirring in 2 tablespoons
sugar. Heat to boiling.  Cook, stirring, until slightly thickened,
about 5 minutes.  With pastry brush, brush sugar mixture evenly over
top of bread. Serve warm, or cool loaf completely to serve later.

I've also made 3 small (3.5x6 inch) loaves with this recipe, baked at
350F for 45 minutes.
