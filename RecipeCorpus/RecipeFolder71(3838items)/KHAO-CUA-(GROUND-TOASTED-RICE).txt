Title: KHAO CUA (GROUND TOASTED RICE)
Categories: Thailand
Yield: 1 Cup
2 c  Rice, short grain; uncooked
Place rice, 1/2 cup at a time, in dry wok and heat
over moderate heat, stirring frequently to keep it
from burning, and to allow it to develop a uniform,
deep golden color - 2 to 3 minutes. Then remove it
from heat and cool to room temperature. Grind to a
fine power in blender, spice or coffee grinder.
