1/2 c  Honey
1/2 c  Molasses
3/4 c  Sugar, brown
1    Egg
1 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Lemon rind; grated
2 3/4 c  Flour; sifted
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Cinnamon, ground
1 ts Cloves, ground
1 ts Allspice, ground

1/3 c  Citron; chopped

1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  ;Water
1/4 c  Sugar, confectioners
Mix the honey and molasses; bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat
and cool thoroughly.  Stir in the brown sugar, egg, lemon juice, and
lemon rind. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and spices. Stir
into the honey-molasses mixture.  Mix in the citron and nuts. Chill
the dough overnight.  Roll a small amount at a time, keeping the rest
chilled. Roll out to 1/4 inch thickness and cut into oblongs 1 1/2 x
2 1/2 inches. Place about 1 inch apart on a greased baking sheet.
Bake in a 400 F (moderate/ hot) oven for 10 to 12 minutes until, when
touched lightly, no imprint remains. While the cookies bake, make the
Glazing Icing. Boil together the sugar and water until the first
indication of a thread appears (230F). Remove from the heat.  Stir in
the confectioners' sugar. Brush the hot icing thinly over the
cookies. (When the icing gets sugary, reheat slightly, adding a
little water until clear again.)
