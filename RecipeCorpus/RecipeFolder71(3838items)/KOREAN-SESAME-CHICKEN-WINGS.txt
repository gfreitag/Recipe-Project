1/2 c  Cornstarch
1 1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Sugar

Cut wings in half after removing tips. Wash and pat
dry. Mix remaining ingredients and marinate wings 3
hours or overnight. Batter will be thick, but will
thin down during marinating. Deep fry until golden
brown and drain on paper towels.

Notes:  Sliced flank steak or boneless chicken pieces
may be substituted. I usually double the sesame seeds
and green onions.

Sharon, Anna's recipe is similar to one I have.  I've
used both flank steak and chicken (wings and breast
fillet strips). The main difference seems to be the
addition of flour and cornstarch and deep frying
(watch them arteries!).  I posted it a long while ago,
so this is a reprint.
