Categories: Salads, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Red bell peppers
1    Yellow bell pepper
1    Orange bell pepper
1 1/4 c  Green lentils; washed
3 c  Water
1 sm Onion; peeled
1    Garlic clove; peeled
1 sm Red chili pepper
-- seeded & finely chopped
1 sm Red onion; thinly sliced
1/2 c  Dried apricots
-- thinly sliced
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
1    Lemon; juiced
2    Garlic cloves; crushed
1 tb Chopped fresh coriander
1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
2 ts Ground cumin
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Heat the broiler.  Broil the peppers until charred and blistered on
all sides.  Tie in a plastic bag or place in a covered dish and let
cool to loosen skins.

Put the lentils, water, onion, and garlic into a 2-quart saucepan.
Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, uncovered, for 20 to 25
minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still a little crunchy.
Drain and place in a large bowl.

Meanwhile, make the dressing.  Blend the oil, lemon juice, garlic,
coriander, parsley, and cumin, and season with salt and pepper. Drain
the lentils, discard the onion and garlic, and place the lentils in a
large bowl.  Stir in the dressing and set aside.

Peel and seed the bell peppers over a bowl to catch any juices, slice
the flesh thinly, and reserve.  Pour any juices into the lentils and
leave to cool completely.

Stir the bell peppers, chili peppers, onion, apricot slices, and salt
and pepper to taste into the lentils and serve at once.

Serves 4-6
