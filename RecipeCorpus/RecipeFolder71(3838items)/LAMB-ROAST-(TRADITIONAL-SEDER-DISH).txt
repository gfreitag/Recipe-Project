Recipe by: Yaara Di segni <msyaara@PLUTO.MSCC.HUJI.AC.IL> Make a few
cuts in the roast so spices can be inserted in the cuts. Deep cuts
can also be made to facilitate serving.

Put the leg in a baking pan with the spices rubbed all over the
roast. mix the soup with the lemon juice and add about a quarter of
quantity to the roast.

Roast in a preheated oven at 210 (Celsius) for 10 minute and then
turn the meat over. Lower heat to 150 degrees andf keep baking for
about 25 minutes for each kg of meat. Every 10 minutes baste with the
liquids and add someo f the soup&lemon souce. every few times turn
the roast.

The baking times are according to wht's written in the recipe we
have. As our oven doesn't have temperture settings (the oven is 25
years old and the writing on the knob disappeared....) we only
guessed the temperature but yet it came out great. It was the best
dish of the evening and although it looked somewhat overdone from the
outside it was as soft as butter.
