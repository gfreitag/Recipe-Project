Categories: Desserts, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 2 Servings
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
2 lg Ripe Bartlett pears,

Sprinkle the lemon juice over the pears.  Combine the lavender and
pepper and sprinkle over the pears. Serve on a plate with a knife and
fork.

cheese as an accompaniment takes the dessert out of the
"Heart-Healthy" category, but makes it a "More Betterly".
