Title: LIMA BEAN & FENNEL STEW
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Dried lima beans
-Water for soaking, plus
4 c  Water for cooking
3 md Potatoes
2 lg Carrots
1 lg Onion; diced
2 tb Olive oil
1/4 ts Fennel seed
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Marjoram
2    Garlic cloves
-- finely chopped
2 tb Water
1/2 c  Dry white wine
4 oz Mushrooms; thinly sliced
1 sm Bulb fennel; diced
1    Bay leaf
1 tb Tamari
1 tb Lemon juice
Pick over and wash lima beans, and soak them in water to cover at
least 6 hours or overnight.  Drain off the soaking water and place
the limas in a large stewpot with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then
lower the heat and simmer gently for 1 hour.

Scrub the potatoes and carrots.  Cut the potatoes in 1/2-inch dice.
Cut the carrots in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 1/4-inch
slices. Add the potatoes and carrots to the limas. While they are
cooking, saute the onion in 1 tablespoon of oil until golden brown.

Crush the fennel seed lightly in a mortar and add it along with the
thyme, marjoram, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of water to the onion.
Cook over low heat for 3 minutes to blend the flavors. Add the wine
and simmer until the liquid is reduced a little. Scrape the onion
mixture into the bean mixture and return the skillet to the burner.
Saute the mushrooms in the remaining tablespoon oil until they turn
golden around the edges. Add the mushrooms to the stew, adding more
water if necessary to keep the stew from sticking.

Add the diced fennel bulb, bay leaf, and tamari, and simmer about 10
minutes or until the fennel bulb is just tender. Add the lemon and
serve immediately.
