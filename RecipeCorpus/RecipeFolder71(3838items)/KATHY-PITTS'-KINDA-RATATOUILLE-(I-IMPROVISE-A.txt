Title: KATHY PITTS' KINDA RATATOUILLE (I IMPROVISE A
Categories: Vegetables, Stews
Yield: 1 Batch
1 sm Eggplant, unpeeled, and
-cut into 1-inch chunks)
1 lg Onion, sliced
1    Green bell pepper, sliced
1    Red bell pepper, sliced
1    Yellow bell pepper,sliced
3    Tomatoes, 1" chunks
2    Zucchini or other summer
-squash, cut in 1" chunks
3 cl Garlic, minced
Olive oil
Chopped fresh herbs
(basil, oregano, parsley)
Salt, pepper to taste
Use a big deep fryin pan for this (your chicken fryer
would be about right).  It's the kind of dish that
tends to "grow" alarmingly as you toss things in.

Film the bottom of the pan with olive oil, and heat
until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion and garlic,
and saute until wilted.  Add the tomatoes and
eggplant, and cook until they begin to release some of
their juices.  Now toss in everything else, cover the
pan, and cook over low heat, stirring frequently,
until the remaining vegetables are tender. Season to
taste with herbs, salt, pepper, and remove from the
heat.

May be served hot, at room temperature (best, IMHO),
or slightly chilled.

I can make a meal of this with some good French or
Italian bread and butter, but it's also a nice side
dish with grilled poultry.
