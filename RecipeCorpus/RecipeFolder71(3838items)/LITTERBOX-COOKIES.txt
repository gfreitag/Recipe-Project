To make: Microwave the honey till it bubbles(about 1 minute). add the
butter, and the molasses, if any. Add the egg, mix well, then mix in
all the other stuff. A dd mix-ins of your choice to some or all of
the batter.

Chill 1 hour in the freezer or several hours in the fridge. Roll
dough logs of random length and the diameter of cat poops. Roll logs
in grape- nuts and bake at 350 degrees till done (10 to 15 minutes).

Serve in a disposable cat litter box on a bed of grapenuts, with a cat
litter scoop.  I hear you get lovely effects by decorating the box and
scoop with melted chocolate or pudding.

This recipe worked especially well at the halloween party where the
table was already decorated with plastic flies
