Note just above recipe states that the texture of this bread is
much like a sponge cake.  Serve it thinly sliced with fresh berries
and whipped cream OR, for tea, toast and then layer with ricotta and
sprinkle with golden raisins.  You can vary the recipe by
substituting orange OR lime for the lemon.
1.  Process according to manufacturer's instructions for basic
bread.
2.  Turn out immediately onto a rack to cool.  Wrap in plastic to
store.
