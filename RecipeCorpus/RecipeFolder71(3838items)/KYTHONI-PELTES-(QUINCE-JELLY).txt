Categories: Greek, Condiments
Yield: 1 Servings
Karen Mintzias
1 kg Quinces
4 c  Water
Granulated sugar
2 ts Lemon juice
2    Rose geranium leaves
Cooking time: 2 hours

Wash quinces well to remove the fuzz.  Peel and core.
Slice quinces into preserving pan and add 2 cups
water.  Leave aside and do not be concerned if quince
discolours.

Place peels and cores into a pan with remaining water
and boil for 30 minutes.  Strain and make liquid up to
2 cups with water.  Add liquid from peels to sliced
quinces in pan.  Bring to the boil and simmer gently
for 1 hour until quince flesh is very tender.

Scald a large piece of cheese cloth or doubled butter
muslin, wring out and drape over a deep bowl.  Pour
quince and liquid into clean cloth and gather up ends.
Tie with string and suspend over bowl.  Secure to a
fixed object so that juice can drip slowly into bowl.
Leave for 24 hours.  Do not squeeze bag to hasten
dripping as this will make jelly cloudy. Measure juice
into clean preserving pan.  For each cup of juice add
1 cup sugar. Stir over heat till sugar dissolves, add
lemon juice and washed geranium leaves and bring to
the boil.

Boil rapidly for 25 minutes, skimming frequently.
Test a teaspoonful on a cold saucer.  Leave to cool.
Run finger across jelly in saucer - setting point is
reached when surface wrinkles.  It is advisable to
remove pan from heat while jelly is being tested as
you would overcook the jelly. Remove leaves and ladle
hot jelly into hot sterilized jars.  Seal when cold.
