Title: KY COLONELS SECRET PORK BBQ SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Bar-b-q
Yield: 4 Cups
2 1/2 c  Water
1/4 c  Vinegar
1 tb Sugar
3 ts Pepper
2 tb Butter
3 ts Salt
1/4    Chopped onion
1    Clove garlic, minced
1 ts Red pepper
2 ts Chili powder
1 ts Red pepper sauce
1 ts Dry mustard powder
3 tb Worcestershire sauce
Combine all ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to a
boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer for

basting meat with this at the beginning of the cooking
process. Baste and turn until pork registers 170
degrees on a meat thermometer (takes about 20 minutes
for country ribs.)
