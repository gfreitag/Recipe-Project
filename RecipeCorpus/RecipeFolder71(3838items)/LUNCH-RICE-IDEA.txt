Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 1 Servings

A near-empty refrigerator can breed creativity:

1.  Mix some ff plain yogurt with dill weed, celery seed, and a little
salt. Put it in a small container.

2.  Put some cooked brown rice in another, larger container.

3.  At lunchtime, mix the seasoned yogurt into the rice. At 6:30 this
morning I thought, "Girl, you MUST be desperate." At 1:00 this
afternoon I enjoyed a delicious lunch.
