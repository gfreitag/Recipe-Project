Categories: Ethnic, Meats, Russian
Yield: 10 Servings
1/2 lb Beef liver
1/2 lb Beef lung (optional)
1/4 lb Ground beef
2 c  Raw rice, rinsed & drained
1 tb Fresh coriander, chopped
2 ts Salt

4 ea Ribs of celery, halved

1 ts Peppercorns
4 qt Clear beef stock
1.  Char the liver over charcoal or under a gas or
electric broiler to kosher.  Cut the liver into
1/4-inch cubes.  If used, boil the lung in water for
1/2 hour.  Cool and cut into 1/4-inch cubes. 2.  In a
large bowl, mix together well the liver, lung
(optional), ground beef, rice, coriander, salt, and
pepper.  Sew up one end of the intestine (derma) and
stuff -- not too tightly since the rice will expand.
Sew up the opening. 3.  On the bottom of a large pan,
put the celery, onion, bay leaves, and peppercorns.
Pour in the clear beef stock.  Bring to a boil over
moderate heat and add the stuffed casting.  Half-cover
the pan and reduce the heat to low.  Cook for about 45
minutes or more, until the skin is tender. Serve the
kishke warm, sliced.   Remove the bay leaves and serve
the clear soup separately.  Makes 10 to 12 servings.
