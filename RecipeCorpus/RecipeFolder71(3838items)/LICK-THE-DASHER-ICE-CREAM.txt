Title: LICK THE DASHER ICE CREAM
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Cornstarch
1/4 ts Salt
4 c  Milk
4    Eggs, beaten
2 tb Vanilla
4 c  Light cream
Mix sugar, cornstarch and salt in the top of a double boiler. Blend
in milk gradually and cook over hot water, stirring occasionally
until mixture is thickened, about 12-15 minutes. Blend in a small
amount of the hot mixture into the eggs, then stir the eggs into the
rest of the mixture. Cook 4-5 minutes more, stirring constantly.
Chill custard (I chill overnight if possible). Add vanilla and
chilled cream. Fill freezer not more than 2/3 full. Freeze in
hand-cranked or electric freezer with a mixture of 1 part ice cream
salt to 6 parts crushed Ice. When mixture is frozen, the electric
motor grinds to a halt; the hand crank can no longer be turned.
Remove the dasher and repack the freezer with ice and salt -- i part
salt to 8 parts ice. Cover with a rug or blanket and let cream ripen
in the freezer for about 2 hours. Or pack into containers and
transfer to a home freezer for hardening.

Variations:

Butter Pecan - use brown sugar instead of white, and add 1 cup chopped
pecans, toasted or sauteed in butter.

Chocolate - add 4 oz unsweetened chocolate, melted, and 1/2 cup more
sugar to the basic mix.

Peach/Strawberry/Raspberry - Add to the mix 2 cups pureed, slightly
sweetened fruit.

Lemon - Omit the vanilla and add 1 cup more sugar, 1 cup fresh lemon
juice, and the grated rind of a couple of lemons. (I haven't tried
this one yet, but plan to soon!)
