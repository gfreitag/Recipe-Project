Title: MAPLE GLAZED HAM FOR SMOKER
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
1    5-7 lb fully-cooked bone-in
-ham (shank or butt)
1 1/2 c  Maple syrup
1 ts Ginger
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Allspice
16    Whole cloves
Pineapple slices, canned
Marachino cherries
Directions: Use a fully-cooked whole, shank or butt ham increasing
cooking time for larger whole ham.  If a country ham is used, soak it
in water or apple cider (for a sweet flavor) a few hours or overnight
to remove some of the salty taste. Remove thick skin if a strong
smoke flavor is desired. Trim fat leaving no more than 1/2" thick
covering.
Score ham. Combine syrup, ginger, nutmeg and allspice. Place ham in a
large dish and baste with syrup mixture. Let the ham stand in syrup
for 1 to 2 hours or until it reaches room temperature; baste
frequently with syrup. When ready to smoke, remove ham from dish,
stud with cloves and place on smoker grid. Baste with syrup at least
twice while smoking. Before last hour of smoking, decorate with
canned pineapple slices and cherries, baste again.  If using a meat
thermometer, fully cooked ham should reach an internal temperature of
130-140 degrees. Make certain the thermometer is not touching the
bone. CHARCOAL: Use 7-8 lbs. charcoal, 3 quarts hot water, 3-4 wood
sticks and smoke 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. ELECTRIC: Use 3 quarts hot
water, 3-4 wood sticks, and smoke 2-3 hours. GAS: Use 4 quarts hot
