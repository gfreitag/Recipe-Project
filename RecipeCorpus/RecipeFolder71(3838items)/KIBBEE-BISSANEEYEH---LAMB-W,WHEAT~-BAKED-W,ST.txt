Categories: Main dish, Ethnic, Lamb, Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------STUFFING-------------------------------
2 tb Olive oil
1 lb Coarsely ground lamb
2 tb Pine nuts
1 lg Onion; finely chopped
Salt to taste
Ground allspice; to taste
MMMMM---------------------------KIBBEE--------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Fine bulgur
2 lb Ground lamb; finely ground
1/4 c  Cold water
2    Medium onion; grated
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground allspice
1 pn Nutmeg; grated, pinch
1 pn Cayenne pepper (optional)
3 tb Butter; room temperature
Preheat the oven to 375F. Make the stuffing. Heat the
oil in a saucepan and add the coarsely ground lamb,
the pine nuts, onion, salt, and allspice. Cook,
stirring, until browned. Set aside to cool as you make
the kibbee base. Make the kibbee. Soak the bulgur in
water to cover for 10 minutes or until softened. Drain
well. Add the finely ground lamb, cold water, and
onions and knead the mixture well. Keep moistening
your hands so the mixture does not stick to them.
Knead in the spices. Some like a thick kibbee, some a
flatter one. About 1 1/2 inches is a good height.
Depending on the height you want, butter a round or
rectuangular baking pan with 1 Tbl of the butter.
(About 10 inches in diameter is fine for 1 1/2-inch
high kibbee.) With wet hands, press half the kibbee
mixture into the pan, patting it level. Spread the
stuffing evenly over the base. Cover with the rest of
the kibbee mixture and pat with moistened hands. With
a knife dipped in cold water, cut a diamond pattern
through the layers. Dot with the remaining butter.
Bake for 10 minutes, then lower the heat to 325F. Bake
for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until browned and
bubbling. Do not overcook. Serve hot with yogurt and
salad. Instead of making if one big fat kibbee, I like
to make "meatballs." I take about 2 Tbl of meat
mixture and flatten in the palm of my hand. Then I
take about 1-2 tsp of filling and put that in the
middle of the meat. Then I take another 2 Tbl of meat
mixture, flatten and place over the meat with the
filling. Shape into oval-shaped meatballs. Bake the
same way as above.
