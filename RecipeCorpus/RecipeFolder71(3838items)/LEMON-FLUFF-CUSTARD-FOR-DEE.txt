Title: LEMON FLUFF CUSTARD FOR DEE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
3    Eggs; well beaten
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt; optional
1 c  Half and half; scalded
1 c  Sour cream
1/4 c  Lemon juice; fresh squeezed
1 ds Cinnamon
1 ds Nutmeg
3/4 c  Currants; or raisins
1 1/4 c  Rice; cooked/cooled
1    Nutmeg; fresh grated
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Mix the well-beaten egg with the sugar and salt. Add one-half of
scalded half and half in a very fine stream, stirring vigorously all
the while. Mix the sour cream into the remaining half and half, and
stir into the first mixture, along with the lemon juice.
Add the rice, currants (or raisins), and nutmeg. Mix together well.
Pour the mixture into a buttered casserole, and set it in a shallow
pan. Pour hot water into the pan, so that it comes about half-way up
the side of the casserole. Grate the fresh nutmeg on top of the
custard.
Bake 1 1/2 hours, or until the custard is set and turning golden on
top. Just for you, Dee...enjoy!
