Title: LENTILS & RICE
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg Onion
2 tb Curry powder
1 ds Olive oil
1 c  Lentils
4 c  Water
1 big onion chopped & sauteed with 2 Tbsp currie powder (I confess to
using 1/4 tsp. extra virgin olive oil here). Add a cup of lentils and
4 cups of water and cook for 2 hours. Serve over steamed rice (I
prefer the sticky Jasmine white rice which I buy in 25 pound bags). I
serve it with coleslaw made with FF honey/mustard dressing. Yummy!
