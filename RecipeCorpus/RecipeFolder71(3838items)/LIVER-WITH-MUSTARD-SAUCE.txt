Categories: Main dishes, Beef
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Beef liver -- sliced 1/2"
Thick
1 tb Butter
1 tb Cooking oil
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Beef stock
2 tb Dijon mustard
3/4 c  Whipping cream
Heat butter and oil over high heat in large frying pan until foam
begins to subside. Sift flour onto large plate and dredge liver in
flour. Saute liver for two minutes on each side, regulating heat to
keep butter and oil very hot, but not burning. Remove liver to
holding plate. Add stock to pan and boil down rapidly until reduced
by half. Add cream and boil until thickened to coat spoon nicely. Off
heat, whisk in the Dijon mustard. Spoon sauce over liver and serve.
