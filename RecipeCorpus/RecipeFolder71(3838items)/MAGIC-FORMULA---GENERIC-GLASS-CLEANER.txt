1/2 c  Ammonia (sudsy or clear,
Your choice)

almost to the top with water. Add 1 t dishwashing liquid and mix. Top
off with water. Use like Windex or any other general purpose spray

than most commercial window and kitchen sprays. Alcohol is the secret
ingredient, and what commercial window washers use. Safe on _most_
~-but not * all * -- household surfaces.
