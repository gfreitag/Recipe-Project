Kitchri is an Indian recipe, a satisfying and
wholesome mixture of rice and lentils lightly spiced
with ginger and chilli. Adding a few peas to this
mixture turns it into a meal in itself.

Drain the washed rice and lentils. Melt the margarine
or butter and saute the onion, ginger, garlic and
chilli in it until the onion is lightly browned. Add
the rice and the lentils and stir-fry for a minute or
two. Pour in the water and add a little salt. Bring to
the boil, reduce the heat and simmer gently for 20
minutes. Serve with the cooked peas.
