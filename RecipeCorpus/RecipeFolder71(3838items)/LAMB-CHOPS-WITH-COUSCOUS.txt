2 c  ~water
1 c  Couscous

2    Red bell peppers; seeded and
-diced
1 cl Garlic; minced
Salt and pepper
8    Rib lamb chops
Bring the eater to a boil in a 6-cup saucepan.  Stir in the couscous,
reduce heat to very low, cover and cook 5-10 minutes, until all water
is absorbed. Meanwhile heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a skillet and
saute the red peppers ad garlic until the peppers are softened, about
8 mnutes. Stir in the couscous.  Add salt and pepper to taste. Film
the bottom of a large skillet with oil.  Set it over high heat and
arrange the lamb chops in the skillet.  This should be done over high
heat to brown the chops on both sides, cooking only long enough to
heat them through. Meanwhile, put the couscous mixture over medium
heat, stirring acasionally to remove all clumps.  Add additional oil,
if necessary to create a smooth mixture. On a serving platter,
arrange the lamb chops like fallen dominoes or shingles, one on top
of the next. Spread the couscous in a ring around them.
