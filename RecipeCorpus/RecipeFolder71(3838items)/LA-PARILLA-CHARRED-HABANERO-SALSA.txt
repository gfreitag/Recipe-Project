Title: LA PARILLA CHARRED HABANERO SALSA
Categories: Mexican, Salsas, Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
3    Roma (plum) tomatoes
3    Habanero chiles
1/4 c  Water
1/8 ts Kosher salt
Salsas in the Yucatan are usually quite simple, while recados tend to
make the dishes they season complex. Perhaps that is why simplicity
is seen as a virtue when it comes to salsas. But I think there is
another reason: the habanero chile, reputedly the hottest pepper in
the world. In addition to the heat, habaneros have a citrusy aroma
and flavor that are best savored on their own. This salsa is the
classical accompaniment to meats and seafood cooked in achiote. Try
it on Grilled Squid Yucatan Style. There are variations with onion,
orange juice, and mint, but this simple version is my favorite.

Pan roast tomatoes until blistered, deeply browned, and soft. Pan
roast chiles until dark brown, then remove seed cores.

Put all the ingredients in a blender and blend smooth. Use within
several hours.
