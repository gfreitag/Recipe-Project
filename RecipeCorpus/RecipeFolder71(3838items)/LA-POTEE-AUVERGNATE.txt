Categories: Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
2    Garlic sausages
6 oz Bacon, in one piece
2 md Onions; thinly sliced
24    Garlic cloves; peeled
1    Calf's foot, split (opt.)
1 lb Pork stew meat
1/2 c  Dry great northern beans
5 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
-=OR=- Water
1 sm Sprig rosemary
1    Sprig thyme
4    Bay leaves
Pepper; to taste
2 md Potatoes
1 ts Salt; or as desired
12 oz Smoked pork chops
1 sm Head green cabbage
- cut into strips
PRICK THE SAUSAGES, then place in a 2-quart heavy pot with bacon and
onions. Place over medium heat on top of the stove and cook 10
minutes. Remove the sausages, and set them aside. Pour off excess
fat. Return the pot to the stove, add garlic, calf's foot and pork
stew meat, cover and cook another 10 minutes. Add beans and enough
broth to barely cover. Add rosemary, thyme, bay leaves and pepper.
Cover, bring to a boil and place the pot in the oven. Turn oven to
350F and cook for 1 hour. Check from time to time and add water if
the beans dry out. Meanwhile, cut the sausages into 1-inch pieces and
quarter the potatoes. When the beans are soft, add salt, smoked pork,
sausages, cabbage and potatoes. Replace the cover and replace the pot
in the oven for another 35 minutes. When it's time to put dinner on
the table, fish the bay leaves out of the pot and serve the potee in
the dish in which you cooked it.
