Categories: Beef, Barbeque
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 lb Flank steak, 3/4" thick
1/4 c  Green onion, sliced
1/4 c  Water

Score meat by making shallow, diagonal cuts at 1-inch intervals
across the steak; repeat on the other side. Place meat in a plastic
bag that's set in a shallow dish.

In a medium mixing bowl, combine green onion, water, red wine, soy
sauce, lemon juice, oil, dill, Worcestershire, garlic, celery seed
and pepper. Pour over steak; seal bag. Marinate in the refrigerator
for 6 to 24 hours, turning the bag occasionally to distribute the
marinade. Drain meat, reserving marinade.

To Grill steak, place directly over medium coals for 12 to 14
minutes, or until it reaches desired doneness, turning once and
brushing occasionally with the reserved marinade. To broil steak,
place the meat on the unheated rack of a broiler pan about 6 inches
from heat; cook 12 to 14 minutes or until it reaches desired
doneness, turning once and brushing occasionally with reserved
marinade.

To serve, use sharp knife to thinly slice meat across the grain.

Note: Excellent and unique.
