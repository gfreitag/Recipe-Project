Title: KEY LIME PIE 2
Categories: Desserts, Pies
Yield: 1 Pie
1    9-inch graham-cracker pie
-shell
5 lg Egg yolks
14 oz (1 can) sweetened condensed
-milk
1/2 c  Key lime juice (or 3/4 c
-regular lime juice)
MMMMM--------------------OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS-------------------------
1    Lime, finely grated zest
1 c  Heavy whipping cream
3 tb Confectioners' sugar
Note on the limes:  *Key* limes are supposed to be
used - they're a bit smaller and are more tart than
the regular limes you see in the market. Ask your
grocer if he/she can get 'em - they make a better pie.
Because the key limes are more tart, you have to use a
bit less juice than when you have the regular ones...

Directions: Preheat the oven to 350F. Put the yolks
into a large bowl and beat 'em with a fork or a wire
whisk. Don't kill 'em, just blend 'em together. Then
slowly blend in the condensed milk, a bit at a time.
Then do the same for the lime juice. The next step is
optional ~ you can either blend in the grated rind, or
you can sprinkle it on top of the pie before baking,
or you can leave it out altogether.  My personal
preference is to blend it in.

Now - pop it in your preheated oven and bake for 13-15
minutes.

While it's baking, whip the cream, slowly adding the
confectioner's sugar while you're whipping.

After it's done baking, let it cool for an hour or so
on a wire rack, then transfer it to the refrigerator
to chill.  Some people like it at room temperature,
but I prefer it chilled.  If you leave it out *too*
long, it goes runny.

Now that it's chilled, you can use the whipped cream
to garnish the whole pie, induvidual slices, or
whatever. I usually garnish induvidual slices with a
lice of lime split & twisted.

Serve with strong, hot, black coffee.  Preferably with
a shot of Bushmill's added.
