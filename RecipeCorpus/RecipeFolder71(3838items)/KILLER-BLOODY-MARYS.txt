Title: KILLER BLOODY MARYS
Categories: Alcohol
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz V-8 juice
2 oz Vodka
1 1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
2 oz Beer (yup)
1/8 ts White pepper
1/4    Lime
1    Rib celery
Splash of hot sauce
Mix V-8, vodka, Worcestershire, pepper and hot sauce
in jar or pitcher. (This amount makes 1 large drink).
Pour over ice, add beer and squeeze lime in.  Stir
lightly.  Garnish with celery.

The beer adds extra kick; it really works!  For a
"semi-virgin Mary" you can eliminate the vodka. Walt MM
