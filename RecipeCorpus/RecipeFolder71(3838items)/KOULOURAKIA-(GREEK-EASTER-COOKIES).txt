DESCRIPTION:  These golden twists are usually baked on
Holy Thursday.

Preheat oven to 375. Beat together butter and sugar
until light and fluffy. Add egg, brandy and vanilla,
mixing well. Add flour, baking soda and salt, mixing
well after each addition. Working with rounded
teaspoons of dough, use palms to roll each piece back
and forth on a lightly floured surface until it forms
a 6-inch rope. Bring ends together to form a hairpin
shape, then gently twist 2-3 times. Lightly pinch ends
together. Arrange 1" apart on greased baking sheets,
brush with egg glaze, then sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Bake 10-13 minutes or until golden. Cool on racks.
Store airtight at room temp for 2 weeks. Freeze for
longer storage. From "The Joy of Cookies," formatted
