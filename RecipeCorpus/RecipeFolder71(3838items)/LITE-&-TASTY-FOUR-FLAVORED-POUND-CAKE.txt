**  I screwed up big time the first time I tried this.... I was in a
hurry to get it in the oven and done in time for supper, and I didn't
read it right. I nonchalantly threw in four eggs, the sugar and the
oil and beat it up before I noticed that it was only the whites that
I needed... All I did to bail myself out of this was to add another
1/4 cup milk and about 1 1/4 cup flour and carried on with dignity..
8-} It turned out okay.. took a bit longer to cook, but the kids said
it was really good.**

So... make sure you read the recipe ALL the way through before
throwing stuff in the bowl... 8-}
