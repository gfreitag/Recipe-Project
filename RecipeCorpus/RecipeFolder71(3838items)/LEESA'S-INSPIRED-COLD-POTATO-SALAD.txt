Categories: Side dish, Salads, Vegetables, Mark's
Yield: 1 Recipe
1 lb Small new potatoes, unpeeled
1 ea Lime, halved
Salt & pepper
Ground serrano chile
Jalapeno chiles, sliced
Place the potatoes in a pot of water & bring to a boil. If the
potatoes are quite small, leave whole, if larger you may need to
halve or quarter them, but do not make them too small. Simmer
potatoes until they are cooked through, but do not overcook them.
Remove from heat, drain & plunge into cold water to stop them
cooking. Chil lightly in the refrigerator.

When ready to serve, slice the potatoes fairly thickly. Sprinkle with
salt & pepper & generously spray with the juice of 1/2 a lime, use a
whole lime if they are small.  Sprinkle with serrano chile powder
(this is available from Mexican or Spanish style supermarkets &
imparts a more smoky flavour than ground red chiles) & garnish with
jalapenoes. Serve as part of a salad buffet.

This is an excellent dish to take on a picnic. Prepare it at the
picnic, just cook the potatoes before you go & serve as part of a
salad.
