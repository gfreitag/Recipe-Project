Stephen Ceideburg
4    To 6 lamb kidneys
1/2 lb Veal, lamb or other mild
-liver
2    Or 3 slices pancetta, about
-2 ounces
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Olive oil
1 tb Chopped fresh thyme leaves
The liver remains pink on the inside, the kidney is
tender and sweet, and the pancetta bathes both with
its earthy salt taste. Cut the kidneys into1/2-inch or
slightly larger pieces, discarding the core. Cut the
liver and pancetta into 1/2-inch pieces. Thread onto
skewers, alternating kidney, pancetta and liver. Put
the skewers in a shallow glass baking dish and sprink-
le with the salt, pepper, olive oil and thyme. Grill
over medium heat 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Do not
overcook. Makes six 8-inch brochettes.
