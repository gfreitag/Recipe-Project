Kishka/easier

Who wants to stuff 9 feet of beef casings? !!!  Here's
a mock kishka recipe that's much easier and very good.

Kosher salt Freshly ground pepper Paprika

(my mon uses a Ritz Crackers instead of corn flakes)

Melt margerine in hot water. When completely melted,
add flour, bread, corn flakes and onion.  Add salt and
pepper and enough paprika to give reddish color.
Tear off two pieces of foil 15 inches long.  Place
mixture shaped into two long rolls along edge of foil
about 2 inches from eachedge. The roll should be 1 1/2
inches in diameter. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and
15 minutes. Allow to cool slightly. Wrap in fresh tin
foil and freeze. Then when ready for use, slice, place
on cookie sheet and warm thoroughly. Makes about 12
pieces. You can also use a sauce with this too. try a
mushroom sauce or beef sauce. Packages sauces are good.
