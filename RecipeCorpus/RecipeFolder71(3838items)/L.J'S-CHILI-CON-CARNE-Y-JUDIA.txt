Cut meat into 1 inch chunks or thereabouts. Let meat soak in a bowl
with the tomatoes and juice, lemon juice, mushrooms, black pepper,
crushed chilis, diced peppers and onions over night. Remove the meat
and brown in a skillet. Takes a while but worth it. In large pot
place put all the ingredients except the beans including the above
marinade and slow cook for three hours. Next stir in your beans and
cook slowly for one more hour. Do not cook with the lid on the pot as
the chili will not "thicken". If chili is not thick enough you can
add flour (corn) mixed with water. With the thick "soupy" ring around
the pot; stir back into the simmering chili.

You might like the chili hotter or maybe milder, depends on your
taste. What ever you do, don't ruin the chili by making it hotter
with hot sauces, this has a tendency to make the chili into
"superficial" body heat not a deep solid heat.
