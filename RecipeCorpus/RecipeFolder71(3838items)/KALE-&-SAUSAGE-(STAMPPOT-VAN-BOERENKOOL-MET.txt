Strip, wash and cut up the kale very finely.  Boil
kale in little boiling water with salt, about 40
minutes.  Add peeled and cut potatoes and sausage and
enough water to prevent burning (cooking time 30
minutes). Remove sausage from pan, mash remainder and
stir in boiled milk until smooth. Taste, add some
pepper if desired.

"Stamppot" means that the vegetables and potatoes are
mixed to a smooth consistency.  It is a typical
winterdish at home and the Dutch have a saying: never
eat curly kale before the frost has got at it.
