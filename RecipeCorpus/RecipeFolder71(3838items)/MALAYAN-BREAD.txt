Sieve the flour and salt onto a pastry board or table. Make a hollow
in the center and pour in the beaten egg. Add a little cold water and
mix to a stiff dough. Knead for several minutes. Divide the dough
into 3 pieces, roll each out very thinly.  Spread the dough with the
melted mutton fat. Pull the dough out by hand until it is paper thin.
Gather up the outside ends and knead all together again.  Roll to a
very long thin strip. Gather the dough up on one end and roll the
strip up. Roll it out thinly and cut out circles 6-inches in
diameter. Heat fat in a frying pan and fry the bread on both sides.
