Title: LOW CARB MUFFINS
Categories: Low-cal
Yield: 12 Servings
1/2 tb Vegetable oil
4    Eggs
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
1/4 c  Low fat cottage cheese
2 tb Soy flour
1    Package artificial sweetener
1.  Preaheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat muffin cups with a little
vegetable oil. (or use butter, margarine, or pan spray) 2. Separate
the eggs very carefully, allowing no egg yolk to mix with the whites.
3. Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until frothy. Add the
cream of tartar and continue beating just until stiff peaks form. 4.
Combine egg yolks, cottage cheese, soy flour, and sweetener.  Fold
this mixture carefully into the egg whites. 5. Fill each muffin cup
2/3 full of batter. Bake the muffins for about 30 minutes, until the
are golden brown and spring back when touched. Variation:  To make
spice muffins, stir 1/2 ts cinnamon, 1/4 ts ground ginger, and 1/8 ts
cloves into the soy flour before adding to the egg yolks.

Note These turned out tasty but sort of fell like crumpets, I would
be more careful about not overmixing next time. MM
