Title: KOHLRABI INFORMATION
Categories: Vegetables, Info/tips
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Kohlrabi
It resembles a turnip in appearance.

It is a relative of the cabbage, and my mother would
boil it and serve mashed with butter.  It would also
appear in some of the homemade soups during the fall.

One cookbook we have describes the basic preparation:
Remove leaves; save young tender ones to cook
separately.  Pare thickened stem and cut into slices.
May be boiled, baked, steamed or fried, dressed with
butter or a sauce.  Young kohlrabi may be eaten raw as
a salad, cut into julienne strips and marinated in a
French Dressing.
