Title: LEG OF LAMB WITH MUSTARD GARLIC & ROSEMARY
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Leg of lamb
1/4 c  Olive oil
3 lg Garlic clove
2 tb Dijon mustard
3 tb Rosemary; chopped
Make 1/2" slits in the top and sides of the leg of lamb about 1"
apart. Slice enough garlic slivers to fill each slit, and push the
garlic slivers completely into the slits. This should use 1-2 cloves
of garlic.

Chop up the remaining garlic, and combine with the oil, rosemary, and
mustard to form a paste.  Spread the paste evenly over the top of the
lamb.

Preheat oven to 425.

Cook the lamb for 30-40 minutes at 425, then lower the oven to 375 and
continue cooking for an additional 12 minutes/pound for medium rare,
20 minutes/pound for medium.
