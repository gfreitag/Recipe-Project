Title: MAPLE POPCORN
Categories: Popcorn
Yield: 16 Pieces
-Sue Woodward
1 c  Maple syrup
3 tb Butter
1 ts Vanilla
8 c  Popped corn
Lightly butter a 9"x13" baking pan.  Set aside.  In a heavy saucepan,
combine maple syrup and butter.  Bring mixture to a boil. Cook,
stirring occasionally, until a candy thermometer reaches 275~ (syrup
separates into hard, but not brittle, threads when dropped into very
cold water). Remove from heat; add vanilla extract. Pour over
popcorn. Pack the mixture lightly into the prepared pan; let cool
completely. Cut into small squares.
