MMMMM------------------HERB VINEGAR INFORMATION-----------------------
1.  Gently rinse herbs; shake out excess moisture and allow to dry
naturally, or pat dry carefully. Remove any damaged or discolored
leaves and woody stems. Twist or wring the herbs to release their
volatile oils, and fill a clean glass gallon jar 2/3 full of the
herbs. Add other flavorings as desired (peeled garlic, dried red
chiles, citrus peel, flower petals, ginger, spices). Ginger and
garlic should be peeled and gently mashed with the back of a wooden
spoon; spices should be slightly crushed with a mortar and pestle.

2.  Heat a good quality vinegar until warm to the touch, but do not
allow it to boil. Pour the vinegar over the herbs, stirring well and
gently bruising the herbs with the back of a wooden spoon. Cover with
plastic wrap or a non-metal lid, and store in a cool place for a few
weeks, stirring occasionally.

3.  Strain into sterilized decorative bottles, using a non-metal
funnel and best quality paper coffee filters or double layers of
cheesecloth, taking care not to disturb sediment on the bottom of the
large jar. Place a fresh, unbruised herb branch (and/or chiles,
garlic, citrus peel, and such) into each bottle for garnish. Cork or
cap bottles, and store in a cool, dark place away from direct
sunlight. Use within 6-8 months.

4.  As in fine wine, sediment naturally occurs in vinegar and will not
impair flavor. Red wine vinegar and cider vinegar are apt to develop
sediment, as are herb vinegars augmented with spices. Peeled garlic
cloves will darken or discolor when left in the bottle. As you use
the vinegar, remember to remove or submerge decorative herb sprigs
that are no longer covered.
