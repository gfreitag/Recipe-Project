Categories: Relishes, Vegetarian, Condiments
Yield: 1 Servings
3 lb Eggplants
2 tb Salt
1/3 c  Extra virgin olive oil
1 sm Onion, thinly sliced
1 sm Red bell pepper, julienned
6    Garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 ts Oregano leaves or
1 ts Dried oregano
1 ts Capers, drained
1/2 ts Dried hot red pepper flakes
3 c  White wine vinegar
2 tb Sugar
1. Peel the eggplant and cut into 1/8 inch julienne strips about 2
inches long.  Place the eggplant in a colander, add the salt and toss
well. Cover the colander, place over a large bowl, and let stand 1
hour.

2. Combine the oil, onion, pepper and garlic in a large, heavy,
non-reactive Dutch oven or deep skillet, place over medium heat, and
saute the mixture for 5 minutes. Add the eggplant and saute until
golden on all sides, about 5 minutes. Stir in the oregano, capers,
and hot pepper flakes.

3. Remove the pan from the heat and divide the eggplant mixture among
6 sterilized half-pint jars.

4. Return the Dutch oven to the stove and add the vinegar and sugar.
Turn the heat up to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the
heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and spoon
the liquid mixture equally into the 6 eggplant jars, leaving a 1/4
inch head space in each jar.

5. Seal the jars and process in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes.
Let cool and store in a cool, dark place for 2 to 3 weeks before
using.
