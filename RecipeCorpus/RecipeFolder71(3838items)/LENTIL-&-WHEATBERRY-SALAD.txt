Title: LENTIL & WHEATBERRY SALAD
Categories: Digest, August
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Wheat berries
2 c  Water
1/2 c  Lentils (this was all I had
On hand--more would be
Better)
1 c  Water
x  Assorted vegetables
x  Herbs
x  Fatfree dressing
Put wheat berries and 2 cups water in a saucepan, bring to a boil,
reduce heat, cover and simmer 45 min to 1 hour, until berries are
tender, but still chewy (not mushy).

Sort lentils, removing any deformed ones and any stones that may be
mixed in. Rinse a couple of times, then put them in saucepan with 1
cup of water, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer about 30
minutes, again, so they are done but not mushy.

When both lentils and wheatberries are done, drain any excess water,
put into large bowl and chill while you cut up vegetables. Vegetables
can vary according to what you have on hand. I used:

yellow summer squash green pepper sweet onion peas (I used frozen
peas, straight from the bag--they helped chill the lentils and
wheatberries while thawing) mushrooms parsley (1-2 Tbsp chopped
fresh) basil (1 Tbsp chopped fresh)

For a dressing I used some 7-Seas fatfree red wine vinegar
dressing--just enough to coat everything, but not so much that it was
swimming in dressing.  The bits of red pepper in the dressing also
added a little more color to the salad. (I would have added some
chopped tomato, but we were out.) Toss everything together well and
chill (if you have time; I only chilled it about 15 minutes last
night--but the veggies were all cold when I added them--and the
frozen peas helped out, too). I served this with a crusty sourdough
bread.  It made 3 servings. (Two for us last night, with enough left
for my lunch today.)
