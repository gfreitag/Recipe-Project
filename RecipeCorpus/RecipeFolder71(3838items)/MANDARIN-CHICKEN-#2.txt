towel and sprinkle lightly with garlic salt.

Mix cornstarch, eggs and water, stirring to form a smooth batter. Dip
wings in batter and deep fry in oil. Let sit while making the sauce.

Sweet and Sour Sauce:  select a pan in which all wings can be coated
evenly, such as a large electric fry pan. Combine sugar, vinegar,
water, soy sauce, catsup and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
As sauce begins to thicken, add wings and cook on medium heat. Turn
wings carefully to coat thoroughly with sauce.

Garnish with nuts if desired.  Grated sesame adds a good flavor.

recipe and only scale the batter part.
