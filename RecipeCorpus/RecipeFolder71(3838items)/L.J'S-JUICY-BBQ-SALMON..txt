Title: L.J'S JUICY BBQ SALMON.
Categories: Fish, Bar-b-q, Main dish
Yield: 4 People
4 lb Salmon
1    Lime
2    Onions, sliced
1/2 c  Butter
Salt
Pepper
Throughly clean and wash the salmon. Place salmon on heavy-duty
aluminum foil. Stuff salmon with the sliced onions, butter, salt and
pepper. Also smear butter on the outside of the salmon plus squeeze
the lime juice over as well. DO NOT REMOVE THE SKIN OF THE SALMON.
Sprinkle with more salt and pepper. Wrap the salmon tightly in the
foil so as to make as "air-tight" as possible...usually two layers of
foil. Place on the hot Bbq for 25 - 30 minutes then turn over and
bake the otherside for 15 minutes. Remove from Bbq and serve with
"new" mint potatoes and fresh peas. This is absolutely delicious!
