(CONTINUED) "In a couple of hours you may see tiny
bubbles appear on the surface.  If so, cheer your brew
on by keeping it warm and covered overnight.  In the
morning, celebrate by making sourdough pancakes (which
you'll find ...in our "King Arthur

Flour 200th Anniversary Cookbook").  They are
delicious and quick. Give the remaining starter
another feeding, let it sit for 12 more hours to
ensure its reawakened vigor before you tuck it back in
the frig. Then quietly heave a sigh of relief and
congratulate yourself on your rescue." How to Decide
if You Need to Start Over (groan):

"If your sourdough begins to mold or develop a
peculiar color or odor instead of a "clean, sour
aroma," give a sigh, throw it out and, if you're
patient, start again. Along with the vital yeasts, you
may have inadvertently nurtured a strain of bacteria
that will not be wonderful in food.  This happens very
infrequently so don't let this possibility dissuade
you from a sourdough adventure."

Starter Variations:

"Here are some variations on the basic
flour/liquid/yeast combination that will produce
sourdough starters with different personalities.

*Substitute 1 cup of stone ground whole wheat flour
for 1 of the unbleached all-purpose flour.

*For tap water, substitute water from cooking potatoes.
It contains nutrients which any kind of yeast loves
and along with making the yeast happy, it creates
great flavor in bread.

*Substitute buttermilk for tap water.
