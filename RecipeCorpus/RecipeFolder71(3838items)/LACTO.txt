Title: LACTO: ZUCCINI IN MOCK CREAM SAUCE
Categories: None, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
6 sm Zuccini
2    Cloves Garlic, finely minced
1 tb Butter
1 tb Flour
Salt, Pepper
Grated Asiago or Romano
-cheese (optional)
Grate the zuccini into a calendar (sp), and sprinkle with salt. Place
the calendar over a pan, to collect the zuccini juices, and let sit
for 30-60 minutes. After this period, squeeze the zuccini over the
calendar, reserving all juices that drip out.

Heat some butter, olive oil, or peanut oil in a frying pan, and saute
the zuccini and garlic for 2-3 minutes. While this is occuring, take
the zuccini juices, and heat to near the boiling point (this step is
critical, if the juices are not hot, this will not work).

Make a well in the center of the zuccini, and heat the butter/crisco
for a few seconds, then add the flour to the well, and stir the flour
and butter/crisco together. After 1 more minute, add the hot zuccini
juices, and stir for 30 seconds - you will get a thick sauce.

Mix everything together now, and add pepper, and the optional cheese,
if desired.

This recipe is actually quick and easy, and absolutely delicious. I
love rich french cooking, and this tastes like the zuccini is in a
rich cream sauce, without a drop of cream (or butter, if I use crisco)

This recipe comes from Greg Pongracz.
