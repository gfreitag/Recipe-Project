Greetings! While I eat anchovies in small, infrequent amounts but I do
succumb to the temptation from time to time. For Susan, Carol and all
anchovy with pasta lovers, here is my entry. A variation has been
posted earlier but mine is the one which has earned me > rave
reviews. Enjoy. (By the way, Susan, did you ever catch my posting of
my mussel recipe?) (Each serves one to 1 1/2 persons so adjust
accordingly, with individual taste in mind.) 1 serving a thick pasta,
like fettacine or thick spaghetti or pasta of choice. In a large
skillet, saute garlic in the olive oil slowly until limp. Add herbs
and saute until well mixed and blended. Add remaining ingredients
slowly and over a low-med. Heat. Add the wine last. Cook the pasta to
al dente and then coat with a dash of additional olive oil. Gently
fold the mixture until blended and then serve immediately. Serve with
a dark green salad and a good red wine. An sprinkle of romano & parm.
cheese >> enhances the dish. Even my husband likes this recipe!
