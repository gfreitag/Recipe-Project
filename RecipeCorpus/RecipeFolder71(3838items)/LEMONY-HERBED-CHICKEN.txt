Categories: Poultry

2 ts Minced Garlic
2 ts Dijon Mustard
1/3 c  Lemon Juice
1/4 c  Olive Oil

Combine chicken, garlic, mustard, lemon juice, olive oil, soy sauce,
chives, basil, rosemary, salt and pepper to taste in large plastic
food bag. Secure bag and shake well so marinade coats chicken.
Refrigerate 2 to 3 hours, or as long as overnight. Remove chicken
from marinade. Reserve marinade for basting. Place chicken skin-side
up on shallow baking pan lined with heavy foil. Season lightly to
taste with salt and pepper. Roast on upper oven rack at 425 degrees,
brushing often with marinade after first 20 minutes. Roast until
chicken is sizzling, deeply browned and juices run clear when pierced
with knife at joint of drumstick and thigh, about 45 minutes. Serve
hot or warm. Garnish with chives and lemon wedges. Makes 4 servings.
