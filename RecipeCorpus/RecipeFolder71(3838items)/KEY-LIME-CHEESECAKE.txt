For the crust:  In a bowl, stir together the crumbs
and sugar and stir the butter in well.  Pat the
mixture evenly onto the bottom and 1/2 inch up the
sides of a buttered 10-inch springform pan.  Bake the
crust in the centre of a preheated 375F oven for 8
minutes. Transfer the pan to a rack and set aside to
cool.

For the cake:  In a bowl with an electric mixer beat
together the cream cheese and the sugar until the
mixture is smooth; beat in the sour cream and flour,
then add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each
addition. Add the lime juice, vanilla, and food
colouring and beat until mixture is smooth.  Pour the
filling over the crust. Bake the cheesecake at 375F
for 15 minutes, reduce the temperature to 250F and
bake for 50 to 55 minutes more, or until the centre is
barely set. (it will continue to set as it cools)  Let
the cake cool on a rack, and chill it, covered,
overnight.

Remove the cheesecake from the pan and transfer it to
a cake stand. With a pastry bag fitted with a
decorative tip, pipe the whipped cream into rosettes
on the cake. Garnish with the mint sprigs and lime
slices.
