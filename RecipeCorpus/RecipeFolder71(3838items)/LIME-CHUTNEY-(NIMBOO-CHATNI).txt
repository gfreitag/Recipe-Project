Categories: Preserving, Chutney
Yield: 1 1/4 liter
12    Limes; halved
1 md Onion; peeled, quartered
4    Hot green chile peppers
1 in ginger root
4 oz Seedless raisins
7    Green cardamom pods
1 tb Black peppercorns
1 tb Coriander seeds
1 tb Mustard seeds
4    Dried red chile peppers
1 1/2 c  Cider vinegar
3 tb Coarse salt
1 lb Light brown sugar
Juice the limes. Discard 6 lime halves. In a food processor, combine
remaining 18 lime halves, green chile peppers, ginger and raisins.
Chop finely. Place mixture in a non-metal bowl.  Open cardamom pods.
In a heavy skillet toast peppercorns, cardamom seeds, mustard and
coriander seeds and the dried red chilis for about 3 minutes,
stirring constantly.  Let cool spices on a dry plate, then grind
finely.  Add spices, lime juice, sugar and vinegar to the chopped
fruit mixture.  Stir thoroughly, cover and let steep at room
temperature for two days.  On the third day pour mixture into an
enameled pot (no stainless steel!), add salt and bring to a boil
slowly. Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes.  Fill into prepared clean
jars. Close jars with a tight fitting lid. Store in a cool place.

The chutney should rest for at least 2 weeks (4 weeks recommended)
before opening. Keep open jars in the refrigerator.
