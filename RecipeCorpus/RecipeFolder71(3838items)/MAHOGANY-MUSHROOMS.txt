Title: MAHOGANY MUSHROOMS
Categories: Digest, Oct.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Fresh mushrooms, sliced
2 tb Balsamic vineger
2 ts Sugar
2    Cloves garlic, chopped or
Squashed (use more!)
1 tb Tamari or soy sauce
1 ts Lime juice
1/4 c  Water
Wash and slice the mushrooms into a non-stick frying pan. Add balsamic
vinegar (actually to taste - use less if yours is very strong),
garlic and sugar. Sautee mushrooms until tender, about 15 minutes,
adding water as necessary (about 1/4 cup or so) so that there is a
bit of broth. Add tamari and lime juice, and warm for a few minutes,
then serve immediately.

This should make enough for about four people, as a side dish.
