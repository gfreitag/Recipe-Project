Title: LIME & COCONUT MILK BREAD ABM
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Ounces
MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
2 1/2 ts Yeast
2 c  Bread flour
1 1/4 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 c  Oats
1/4 c  Corn meal
3 tb Sugar
1/2 tb Salt
3 tb Lime peel, grated
1 1/2 tb Oil
3/4 c  Coconut, flaked
1/2 c  Coconut milk, unsweetened
1 c  Water
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

A big summer fruit salad tastes even better with the tropical taste
of this light bread.  Slices are irresistible with nutted cream
cheese or chicken salad.  Spread with a mashed ripe mango if you
like, but eschew jam, which will hide the subtly sweet but tart taste
of the loaf.

Tested in DAK R2D2.  Sylvia's comments:
