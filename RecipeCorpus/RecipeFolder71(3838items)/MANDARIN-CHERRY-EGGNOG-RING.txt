Drain mandarin orange segments.  Dissolve cherry jell-o powder in 1
cup boiling water.  Add cold water. Chill until slightly thickened.
Add mandarin oranges and grapes. Spoon into a 6 cup jelly mould.
Chill until set but not firm; surface should be sticky when adding

over fruit jelly layer in mould. Chill until set, 4 hours or
overnight.

Unmould onto chilled serving plate.  Granish with remaining Dream
Whip if desired. Makes 10 servings.
