LIGHTNING-QUICK FRUIT SAUCE
FOR WAFFLES/PANCAKES
This is great stuff: Take a package of your favorite frozen berries
(I use Cascadian Farms Organic), and zap 'em for 3 1/2 minutes in the
microwave. Frozen berries literally fall apart once they're heated in
this manner, so stir/mash them into a sauce with a fork. Add sugar or
Equal to taste. This is great in combination with yogurt or ice cream
as well. -
