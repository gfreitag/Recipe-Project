Vegetables and herbs must be well washed and dried
before chopping and measuring.  Chopping can be done
very speedily and efficiently in a food processor if
desired.  Accurate measuring of greens is not
essential to success of this dish.

Combine greens in a bowl.  Mix flour with 1 teaspoon
salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle over greens,
then toss well.  Beat eggs until frothy and pour over
greens.  Stir well to combine and adjust seasoning.
Heat butter in a 9-inch round casserole dish or deep
cake pan in a moderate oven.  Swirl to coat sides and
pour in egg mixture.

Bake in a moderate oven, one shelf above center, for
45-50 minutes until set and top is lightly browned.
If insufficiently browned when set, place briefly
under a hot grill.  Serve hot, cut in wedges, with
yogurt and flat bread.  Also good served cold.  Serves
