Makes about 10 half-pints. Wash and peel the lemons thinly; remove the
white pith and seeds and discard them. Cut the peel into fine shreds;
reserve the pulp. Simmer the peel with 2 cups of the water in a
covered preserving kettle for about 1 hour, or until tender. Drain
the liquid from the lemon shreds and set both aside. Wash the
grapefruit and cut it and the lemon pulp into small pieces; cover
with the remaining 10 cups of water and simmer gently in a covered
preserving kettle for 1 1/2 hours, or until the fruit is tender. Add
the liquid from the lemon shreds to the kettle and bring just to a
boil.  Remove from heat and strain mixture through a jelly bag.
Measure the juice into the preserving kettle and add 1 cup of sugar
for each cup of juice. Add the reserved lemon shreds and over high
heat, boil hard for about 15 minutes until a jelly thermometer read
