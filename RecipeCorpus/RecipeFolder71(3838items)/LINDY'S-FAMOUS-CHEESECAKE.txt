5    8 oz cream cheese - softened
1 3/4 c  Sugar
3 tb Flour
1 1/2 ts Grated lemon peel

In medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, lemon peel and vanilla. Make
well in center; add egg yolk and butter. Mix with fingertips until
dough cleans side of bowl. Form into a ball and wrap in waxed paper.
Refrigerate for one hour.

Preheat oven to 400F. Grease the bottom and side of a 9" springform
pan. Remove the side from the pan. Roll one third of dough on bottom
of springform pan; trim edge of dough. Bake 8 - 10 mins, or until
golden.

Meanwhile, divide dough into 3 parts. Roll each part into a 2 1/2"
strip, 10" long. Put together springform pan, with the baked crust on
the bottom. Fit dough strips to side of pan, joining ends to line
inside completely. Trim dough so it comes only 3/4 of the way up side
of pan. Refrigerate until ready to fill.

Preheat oven to 500F. Make Filling: In a large bowl of electric mixer,
combine cheese, sugar, flour, lemon and orange peel, and vanilla.
Beat at high speed, just to blend. Beat in eggs and egg yolks, one at
a time. Add cream, beating just until well combined. Pour mixture
into springform pan. Bake 10 mins. Reduce temperature to 250F and
bake 1 hour longer.

Let cheesecake cool in wire rack. Glaze top with strawberries.
Refrigerate 3 hours or overnight. To serve, loosen pastry from side
of pan with spatula. Remove side of springform pan. Cut cheesecake
into wedges.

And, boy, is it good, Squeaks
