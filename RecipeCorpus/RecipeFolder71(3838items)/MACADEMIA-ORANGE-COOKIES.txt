Title: MACADEMIA-ORANGE COOKIES
Categories: None
Yield: 30 Cookies
MMMMM------------------------COOKIE DOUGH-----------------------------
4 oz Unsalted butter, softened
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Pure vanilla extract
1 c  Flour
1 c  Macadamia nuts, chopped
MMMMM--------------------CANDIED ORANGE RIND-------------------------
2 sm Oranges
1 c  Sugar
4 oz White chocolate, melted
1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. For cookie dough, beat the butter
with the sugar and the vanilla extract until light. Add the flour and
the nuts. Mix until combined. Chill the dough in the freezer 10
minutes.

2. Using your hands, roll pieces of the dough into 3/4-inch-diameter
balls. Place them 2 inches apart on a parchment-covered baking sheet.
Flatten slightly. Bake until just beginning to brown lightly, about
15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.

3. Meanwhile, for candied orange rind, put 4 cups of water into a
saucepan over high heat. Cut the oranges in half crossways, and scoop
out the flesh with a spoon (save flesh for other use). Slice the
rinds into 1/8-inch- to 1/4-inch-thick strips. Place them in the
saucepan. Boil 25 minutes; drain.

4. Rinse the strips and return them to the pan with the sugar and 1
3/4 cups water. Simmer over medium to low heat 25 minutes. Strain the
strips from the syrup, allow strips to cool, and save for final
assembly.

5. To assemble the cookies, dip the bottom of the cookie and 1/4 inch
up the sides into the white chocolate. Tap off any excess chocolate.

6. Put dipped cookies onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Press an
orange-rind strip around the bottom of each cookie, adhering it to the
cookie where the chocolate coats the sides. Chill and serve within a
few hours.
