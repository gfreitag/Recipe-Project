Title: MA'AMOOL B'JOWZ - SWEET WALNUT CAKES
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
750 g  Semolina
1 c  Sugar
500 g  Butter
500 g  Walnuts
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Cold water
1/2 ts Rosewater
Mix thoroughly in a large bowl 750 g semolina and 1 cup sugar. Melt
500 g butter until bubbling, then blend it into the semolina-sugar
mixture. Knead well then set aside for at least one hour or up to 24.

Knead the mixture again then pour in enough boiling water to make a
soft, pliable dough (wear rubber gloves so you can handle the hot
mixture).

Crush 500 g walnut pieces finely (this can be done in a food
processor) and add to 1/2 a cup of sugar. Mix 1/4 of a cup of cold
water with half a teaspoon of rosewater (any Lebanese or Asian food
store) and mix the liquid into the walnut-sugar mix- ture.

Mould the pastry into balls about 5 cm in diameter. Make a cavity in
the centre of each ball with your finger and fill with walnut
mixture. Close the pastry over the top of the filling and flatten the
stuffed pastry ball a little between your hands. Make a design on top
with the tines of a fork

Place these cakes on an ungreased baking tray and cook at 230 C until
lightly browned, approximately 20 minutes. Store in an airtight
container and sift icing sugar generously over the top of each layer
of cakes.
