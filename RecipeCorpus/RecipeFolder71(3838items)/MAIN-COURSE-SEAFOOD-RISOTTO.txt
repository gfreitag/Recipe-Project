2 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
1 1/2 c  Short grain rice
1/2 c  Dry white wine
2 tb Olive oil
3/4 lb Shrimp -- peeled and

Black pepper
4    Plum tomatoes -- seeded and

Fine dice
2 tb Chopped parsley
Set clam juice and broth in a saucepan and have it at a bare simmer
before you begin. Heat olive oil in a wide saucepan and cook the
onions for 5 minutes or until lightly golden. Add the rice and stir,
continuously for a couple of minutes to lightly toast it. Add the
wine and cook gently until almost entirely evaporated.

Add 1/2 cup of the boiling water and stock and simmer the rice,
stirring constantly, until all the liquid is absorbed. Add 1/2 cup
more of simmering liquid and stir the rice until it has again
absorbed the liquid. Continue in this fashion, adding a cup of liquid
after 1 1/2 cups are in. When rice is half way done (after about 15
minutes) cook the seafood.

In another skillet heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and
saute the shrimp and scallops for a minute or until almost entirely
cooked. Transfer the seafood to the rice and continue to finish
cooking the rice until entirely tender (should take about 30 to 35
minutes in all). When done, the rice is just tender, has absorbed the
liquid (you may not need it all). Add the butter, season to taste
with salt and pepper and dish out. Serve immediately or the rice will
continue to cook and turn to mush. Garnish with tomatoes and parsley.
