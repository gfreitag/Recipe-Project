Title: LEMON-GARLIC FLANK STEAK
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Flank Steak (1 Piece)
1/2 md Sweet Onion; Thinly Sliced
And Separated Into Rings
1/3 c  Lemon Juice
1 lg Clove Garlic; Split
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Soy Sauce
Pull off any membrane from the steak and trim away any surface fat.
Score the steak, 1/8-inch deep, on both sides in a diamond pattern.
In a plastic bag or glass dish large enough to hold the steak,
combine the onion, lemon juice, garlic, sugar, salt, and soy sauce.
Add the steak and close the bag tightly if using and turn the meat to
coat thoroughly. Marinate for 1 to 2 hours at room temperature, 6 to
8 hours in the refrigerator. Drain off and reserve the marinade.
Grill the steak 3 to 5 inches above hot coals until rare to
medium-rare, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Meanwhile, heat the
remaining marinade.  Remove the steak to a cutting board and cut, in
thin slices, across the grain, slanting the knife slightly. Serve the
meat with the marinade.
