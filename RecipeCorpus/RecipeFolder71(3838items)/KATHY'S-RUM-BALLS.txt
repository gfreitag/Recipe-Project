Title: KATHY'S RUM BALLS
Categories: Candies
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 tb Lite Karo syrup, 1 cup
-finely chopped pecans, 2
-tbs. powdered
Ingredients:  1 cup vanilla wafer crumbs, 1 cup
confectionery sugar, dutch cocoa, and 1/4 cup or more
of rum, bourbon or amaretta

Combine all ingredients. Using a teaspoon, measure out
the dough and roll into balls. Roll in the
confectionery sugar and put into a foil-lined tin.

Very simple ... I usually make up 2-3 recipes' worth
at once and sit them on the dining room table.
Unfortunately, the temptation is to have one every
time I pass.

Hope you enjoy !
