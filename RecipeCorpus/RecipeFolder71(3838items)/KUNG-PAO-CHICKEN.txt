Add 2 cups oil and heat to 300 degrees. Add chicken,
stirring to separate pieces. Remove and drain. Combine
seasonings thoroughly and set aside. To stir-fry,
remove all but 2 tablespoons oil from wok. Reheat,
swirling pan to coat sides. Add chili pods, breaking

sesame and hot chili oils and finally with roasted
