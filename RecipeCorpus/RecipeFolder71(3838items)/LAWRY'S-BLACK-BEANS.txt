The day before preparing recipe, soak the black beans in cold water
in the refrigerator overnight.  Use an over-sized container to allow
for expansion.

Drain the beans.  Wash thoroughly in cold water to rinse away any
coloration to the water. Place beans in fresh water to cover in a
kettle. Cook until the beans are al dente or slightly firm. Pour into
a colander and discard water. Rinse again in cold water to prevent
any further cooking.

Meanwhile, saute the bacon until half cooked.  Drain off the fat.
Continue cooking the bacon, then add diced peppers, onion, garlic,
cilantro, cumin and cayenne pepper. Saute until peppers are
tender-crisp. Add to precooked black beans in kettle. Gradually add
chicken stock and continue cooking until most of the cooking liquid
is absorbed, leaving a moist, but not dry bean mixture.

Season to taste with the salt and pepper.  Add the Italian dressing
and stir well. Chill. Stir well before serving. Makes 6 servings.
