***FILLINGS FOR KREPLACH***

*Meat:

Heat the fat (I use oil) in a skillet and cook the
meat and onions in it for 10 minutes, stirring
frequently. Add the salt and pepper. Cool before
placing in squares of dough.

*Kasha: 1 cup minced onions 3 tablespoons chicken fat
or butter (depending on whether you are serving a meat
or dairy dish) 1 1/2 cups cooked kasha 1/4   teaspoon
pepper

Lightly brown the onion in the fat or butter.  Stir in
the kasha and pepper.

*Cheese-Potato: 1/2 cup minced onions 3 tablespoons
butter 1 1/2 cups mashed potatoes 1/2 cup pot cheese 1
teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon pepper 1 egg Sour cream

Lightly brown the onions in the butter.  Add the
potatoes, cheese, salt, pepper and egg, beating until
smooth.  Serve with sour cream.

*Chicken: 1 1/2 cups ground cooked chicken 4
tablespoons browned minced onions 1 egg yolk 3/4

Blend all the ingredients together.

*Chicken liver: 1/2 pound chicken livers 1/2 cup
