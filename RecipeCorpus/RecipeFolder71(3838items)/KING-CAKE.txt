Title: KING CAKE
Categories: Cajun, Cakes
Yield: 2 Servings
-New Orleans CB
Dough of your choice for
-1 large coffee cake
-(approximate proportions:
2 oz Fresh compressed yeast
Or
4 pk Active dry yeast
4 c  =TO=
5 c  Flour
1 c  Lukewarm scalded milk
3/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
5    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla extract
3/4 c  Salted butter)
--For recipe
1    Dried bean or tiny (3/4"
-long) china baby doll
1 c  Sugar
5    Or more small bottles of
-assorted food coloring
1 c  Candied fruit
-(preferably small
-pieces)*
After mixing the dough (addint the bean or doll now,
if desired) and letting it rise, shape it into an oval
ring, following the description given abaove for the
approximate dimensions**. Sprinkle the top of the cake
evenly with sugar and make swirls with food coloring
all over the top, with the swirl of one color slightly
overlapping the next. Imbed the the pieces of candied
fruit in the top of the cake, con- centrating most of
them in a band about 1-1/4" wide all the way around.
Set the cake on a baking sheet and bake according to
instructions in the recipe you use. The finished cake
should be lightly browned wherever the dough shows
through; the parts covered with colored sugar should
appear slightly crust.

* The cakes that you purchase in the local bakeries
do not have the fruit on them.

**Dimensions-Shape-an oval ring about 2-1/2" thick
and about 3" high at the highest point; and the
decoration, as elaborate and colorful as possible in
order to make the cake look like a jeweled crown. As
for the bean or doll, it can be baked into the batter
or pushed into the finished cake from underneath-just
so long as it's done secretly, so no one knows in
advance which slice will designate the monarch for the
week.
