Categories: Spreads, Seasonings
Yield: 1 Batch
1/2 lb Unsalted butter
2 tb Dijon mustard
-- or more to taste
1    Or 2 garlic cloves; pressed
3 tb Kalamata olives
-- pitted and chopped
1    Sprig hyssop or thyme
1/2 ts Fresh rosemary
1/4 ts Fennel seed
Blend the butter, mustard and garlic until thoroughly

strongly flavored black olive will do.  The finished
