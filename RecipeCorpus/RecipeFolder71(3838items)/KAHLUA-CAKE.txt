Title: KAHLUA CAKE
Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM----------------------------BASE---------------------------------
2 c  Graham wafers
1/2 c  Butter, melted
1/4 c  White sugar
MMMMM------------------------FIRST LAYER-----------------------------
2 pk 3 1/4 oz. Chocolate pudding
3 c  Milk
MMMMM------------------------SECOND LAYER-----------------------------
2 pk Vanilla instant pudding
2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Kahlua
2 c  Whipping cream, whipped
(BASE): Mix ingredients and press into bottom of pan.
(FIRST LAYER): Cook both packages of pudding using
only 3 cups milk, cool and spread on crust.
(SECOND LAYER): Make both packages of vanilla pudding
using only 2 cups of milk and mix in Kahlua.
In another bowl, make whipped cream or whip 2
envelopes of Dream Whip according to package
directions. Gently fold the instant pudding and
whipped cream together. Put the vanilla mixture over
the chocolate layer. Top with crumbs or grated
chocolate bar. Make in a 9 x 13 pan or halve the
recipe in an 8 x 8 pan. Tip from Lynne - put in
freezer for approx. 15 minutes to firm up to make
serving easier (it does firm up by the second day).
Tip from Cousin Anne - Don't try to be overly generous
with the Kahlua, because she tried and it wasn't as
good. Tip from Joan - Make sure you have lots of milk
on hand as the Dream Whip requires it too.
