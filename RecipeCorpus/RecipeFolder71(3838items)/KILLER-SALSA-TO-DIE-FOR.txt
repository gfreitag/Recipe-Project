Recipe by: chile-heads list - David Wilkinson Here's
my favourite salsa recipe. Quick to make, and
delicious. As with most recipes of this type, the
quantities are variable according to personal taste,
but this is what I like...

Drain a little of the juice out of the tomatoes
(otherwise it gets a little too runny), and then mix
all of the ingredients together. The number of chiles
depends very much on personal taste, and on the type
available (here in the UK we get a much more limited
range on sale), but I'm sure you can all figure out
just how hot you want to make it.

If possible, leave it to stand for at least half an
hour before eating, or even overnight, but I can
rarely wait that long before getting the munchies.

How to eat: well, anyway you like. My favourite is to
make a big bowl of salsa, take a big bag of tortilla
chips, and then to while away the evening on the sofa
dunking one into the other.
