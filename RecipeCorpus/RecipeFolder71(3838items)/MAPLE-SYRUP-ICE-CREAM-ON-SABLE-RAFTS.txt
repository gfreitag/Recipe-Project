Categories: Dairy, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM-------------------------ICE CREAM------------------------------
2 1/2 c  Maple syrup, pure
2    Vanilla beans; split
3 c  Milk
16    Egg yolks
1 tb Butter, unsalted
MMMMM------------------------SABLE RAFTS-----------------------------
9 1/2 tb Butter, unsalted; room temp
3/4 c  Sugar
1    Egg yolk
1 1/2 ts Whipping cream
1 1/3 c  Flour
ICE CREAM:

Combine 1-1/2 cups maple syrup with vanilla beans in heavy medium
saucepan over medium heat and cook until candy thermometer registers
220F. Let mixture cool 15 minutes.

Heat milk in saucepan.  Whisk yolks to blend in bowl. Whisk in milk
in thin stream.  Whisk into maple syrup mixture. Set over low heat
and stir with wooden spoon until syrup is thick enough to leave path
when finger is drawn across spoon.  Strain into bowl and cool.

Set aside 1-1/2 cups custard for sauce.  Transfer remaining custard
to ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's
instructions. Freeze in container four to six hours to mellow.  (Can
be prepared one day ahead. If frozen solid, let soften 30 minutes in
refrigerator.)

Boil remaining 1 cup syrup to 215F.  Add butter.  Cool to room
temperature.

SABLE RAFTS:

Cream butter and sugar in bowl.  Beat in yolk and cream. Stir in
flour. Shape dough into ball.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at
least two hours. (Can be prepared up to two weeks ahead and frozen.
Let stand in refrigerator overnight before continuing.)

Butter eighteen 3-1/2 x 2-inch barquettes (oval molds). Roll dough
out on lightly floured surface to thickness of 1/8-inch. Roll up on
rolling pin and unroll over barquettes. Gently press into molds. Run
rolling pin over dough to trim edges.  Refrigerate until firm.

Preheat oven to 350F.  Line dough with parchment or foil; fill with
pie weights or dried beans.  Bake until golden brown around edges,
about 20 minutes. Remove paper and weights. Bake until bottom is
crisp, several minutes.  Cool slightly in molds.  Unmold and cool
completely on rack.

Spoon some of reserved custard onto each plate.  Fill rafts with ice
cream. Arrange three rafts on each plate. Drop 1/2 teaspoon syrup in
three places on each plate. Draw knife through to swirl. Drizzle
remaining syrup over ice cream.  Serve immediately.
