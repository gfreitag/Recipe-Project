leaf, onion, and peppercorns.  Shape the meat mixture
into balls about 2 inches in diameter.  Add to the
boiling broth and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.
Remove meatballs with a slotted spoon, set aside, and
keep warm. Gravy: To prepare gravy, heat butter in a
frypan and stir in flour.  Cook for 3 minutes,
stirring constantly.  Slowly blend in 2 cups of
reserved broth. Add the drained capers, lemon juice,
and mustard.  Simmer for 5 minutes. Remove a small
amount of the sauce to blend with the egg yolk.  Stir
egg yolk back into the sauce.  Season with salt and
pepper. To Serve: Place reserved meatballs into the
gravy and reheat if necessary.  Serve on a preheated
platter.
