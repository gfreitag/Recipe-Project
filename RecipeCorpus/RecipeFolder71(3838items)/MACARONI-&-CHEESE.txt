Title: MACARONI & CHEESE
Categories: Entrees, Mom
Yield: 6 Servings
16 oz Macaroni, large elbow
16 oz Cheddar, sharp; halved
3 c  Milk, whole
6 lg Eggs
2 ts Worcestershire sauce
5 dr Louisiana hot sauce
1 tb Mustard, dry
1 ts Salt
ds Pepper
Paprika
Boil macaroni and drain.  Slice 8 oz. sharp cheddar in 1/4" thick
pieces and set aside.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Place additional 8 oz. of sharp cheddar in food processor and pulse 4
or 5 times.  Add milk, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, Louisiana hot
sauce, mustard, salt and a dash pepper.  Blend well; cheese should be
well-processed.

Put cooked macaroni in glass casserole.  (My mom always used one of
those square ones.  For a half batch, my glass "loaf pan" that holds
one quart is perfect.)  Pour liquid over macaroni, making sure
mixture is incorporated well.  Pave the top with the reserved cheese
and bake for about an hour, 'till custard sets and top is golden. Can
sprinkle top with paprika for visual interest about 10-15 minutes
before done.

Vicki's notes:

*  This happens to be one of my major comfort foods (why is it always
the ones so high in fat?), tho' I usually halve this recipe b/c there
are only two of us...

*  Can top with 1/2 C bread crumbs tossed in 2 T butter and brown
under broiler at end of cooking time.

*  Instead of casserole, turn macaroni into hollowed tomatoes and bake
approximately 15 minutes.
