Recipe by: rwexler@rivendell.com (Ronnie Wexler) Drain clams reserving
liquid.  Rinse drained clams and set aside. In a heavy saucepan, heat
olive oil.  When moderately hot, add garlic and stir for 10 seconds.
Add tomatoes, sherry, reserved clam juice (being careful not to add
any sediment that has collected in the bottom), oregano, parsley, red
pepper flakes and salt to taste (hold off on the pepper until you've
tasted the sauce). Cook over low to medium heat for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, boil a large quantity of water in a large stockpot, add
linguine and cook until al dente, about 8 to10 minutes. Just before
draining the pasta, add the reserved clams to the sauce.  Drain pasta
and then mix with sauce. Serve with grated Parmesan and/or Romano.

Serves 6 hearty eaters.
