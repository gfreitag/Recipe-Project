1 lb Lean beef or veal, ground
1 md Onion; grated
1    Garlic clove; crushed
2 sl Bread; crusts removed
1    Egg; lightly beaten
3 tb Parsley; (minced)
2    Mint sprigs; chopped
1/2 ts Ground allspice*
1 tb Dry red wine
2 tb Water (more if necessary)
Salt & freshly ground pepper
All-purpose flour
Oil for frying
*Note: Bread slices should be soaked in water, then
squeezed dry.  *Ground cinnamon or corriander may be
substituted for allspice if desired. In a large bowl,
combine the ground meat with the onion, garlic, bread,
egg parsley, mint, spice, and wine and knead for 2
minutes.  The mixture should be soft; add a few
tablespoons of water if necessary.  Season with salt
and pepper to taste, then cover and refrigerate for at
least 1 hour. Pinch off small pieces the size of
walnuts or smaller and roll into balls between your
palms, then dredge lightly in flour.  Heat the oil in
a frying pan to the smoking point, slip in the
keftedes, and fry until crisp, turning constantly with
tongs.  Remove with slotted spoon and drain on
absorbent paper. From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma
