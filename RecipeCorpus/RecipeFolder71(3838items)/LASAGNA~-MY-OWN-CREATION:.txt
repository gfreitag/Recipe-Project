Title: LASAGNA~ MY OWN CREATION:
Categories: Low fat, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Box lasagna (I just use the
Basic type)
1 lg Can tomatoe sauce
3 md Tomatoes
2 lg Green Peppers
1/2 c  Chopped chives
3 tb Finely chopped garlic
1 lg Red onion, chopped
1/2 c  Mushrooms
16 oz FAT FREE Cottage Cheese *

1/4 c  Egg substitute
1 c  Fat-free mozzerella
Onion,
Garlic powder,
Paprika
1 ts Each of oregeon, thyme and
Basil
Fresh ground pepper, vary to
Taste
Cook the lasagna according to package.  Mix the whole container of
cottage cheese with the bread crumbs, chives, egg-substitute, herbs
and spices (except paprika!). Take a large baking dish and coat
bottom with a thin layer of tomatoe sauce.  Then a layer of lasagna.
On top of this spread a layer of the cottage cheese mixture. ON thop
of this a layer of chopped peppers and onions. Then slice tomatoes in
whole circular slices and place a layer on top of the other
ingrediants. Then a layer of tomatoe sauce. Repeat one more time.

On the top add the mozzerella, if desired, and sprinkle that with
about 1/2 tsp of paprika.  Bake at roughly 350-375 for about 45
minutes. I have made this alot and even my SAD friends swear by it.
