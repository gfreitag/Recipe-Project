Categories: Norwegian, Breakfast, Pancakes, Potatoes
Yield: 30 Servings
2 lb Potatoes
1/4 c  Butter
1/4 c  Milk
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1/4 ts MSG
1/8 ts Black pepper
2 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1. Wash, peel and cook the potatoes. Cut in halves and boil. Drain the
cooked potatoes. Dry the potatoes by shaking the pan over low heat.
Mash or rice the potatoes thoroughly. 2. Whip into the potatoes the
butter and milk, and a mixture of the salt, sugar, MSG and black
pepper. 3. Whip the potatoes until light and fluffy. Cool the
potatoes and then chill in the refrigerator. 4. Set a heavy skillet
or griddle over low heat to warm. Do not grease the skillet or
griddle. 5. Remove the chilled potatoes from the refrigerator. Add
about half of the flour and beat until smooth. Beat in enough of the
remaining flour to make a smooth dough, shape into a ball and turn
out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a round about 1/8 inch
thick. Cut into 6 inch "rounds. 6. Test the griddle by dropping on it
a few drops of cold water. If the drops dance around in little beads,
temperature is about right. Do not grease. 7. Place a lefse "round"
on the griddle or skillet and cook until browned. Turn and lightly
brown on the other side. Then, turning frequently, continue cooking
until the Lefse are lightly browned and dry. Remove and place on a
clean, dry towel. Cool completely. 8. To serve ... dust with powdered
sugar, roll and enjoy.
