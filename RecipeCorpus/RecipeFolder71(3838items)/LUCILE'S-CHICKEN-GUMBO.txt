Title: LUCILE'S CHICKEN GUMBO
Categories: Cajun, Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
3 1/2 lb Fryer, cut up
Salt and cayenne to taste
10 tb Flour
Oil
5 cl Garlic, minced
1    Onion, chopped
1/2 c  Chopped green pepper
4    Stalks celery, chopped
3 qt Water
Season fryer pieces with salt and red pepper. Sprinkle chicken with 2
tablespoons flour.  In a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute
chicken in enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Cook chicken
until golden brown.  Transfer chicken to a large pot and drain oil
from skillet, reserving drippings.

To the skillet, add about 5 tablespoons of reserved drippings and
remaining 8 tablespoons of flour.  Cook, stirring constantly, over
medium-low heat until roux is smooth and golden brown, about 20
minutes or longer. Be careful not to burn the roux!  To the cooked
roux, add garlic, onion and cook until soft. Add roux and onion to
the chicken in the large pot. Add green pepper, celery and water to
the large pot and simmer about 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Season
with salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Serve over hot rice.
