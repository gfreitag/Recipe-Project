Title: LAVENDER SHORTBREAD COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Batch
1/2 c  Butter, sweet; room temp
1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
-unsifted
2 ts Dried lavender blossoms
1 ts Crushed dried spearmint
-leaves
1/8 ts Cinnamon
1 c  Unsifted flour
Preheat oven to 325 F.  Prepare an 8" square baking pan by lining it
with aluminum foil and coating the foil lightly with a vegetable oil
spray.

Cream the butter until light and fluffy.  Stir in the sugar, lavender,
spearmint and cinnamon.  Work in the flour and blend until the
mixture is crumbly.  Scrape it into the prepared pan and spread until
level, pressing lightly to compact it evenly.

Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until lightly golden around the edges.
Gently lift both the foil and shortbread out of the pan onto a
cutting surface. Slice the bars with a serrated knife. Transfer to a
wire rack to cool completely.  Store in a tightly sealed tin.

Yield: 25 to 30 bars.

Lewandowski writes: "Try these light and delicate bars and enjoy the
hint of lavender and mint flavors."
