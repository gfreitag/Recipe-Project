Title: LOW-FAT NILLA-NANA CHOCOLATE CHIP MUFFINS
Categories: Muffins, Quickbreads, Brunch
Yield: 16 Muffins
1 c  Sugar
1 lg Egg
2    Ripe bananas; mashed
1/3 c  Applesauce, sweet or unsweet
8 oz Vanilla-flavor lowfat yogurt
10 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
2 c  All purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
Preheat oven to 375~. In a large bowl, combine the sugar and the egg
and blend well. Add the mashed bananas, applesauce, and yogurt and
stir to combine. Stir in the chocolate chips. In a separate bowl,
combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make a well
in the center of the flour mixture and pour the wet ingredients into
the well. Stir until just blended. The batter will be lumpy. Pour the
batter evenly into the two 8-cup muffin pans that have been well
greased or lined with paper muffin cups. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or
until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
This is a light-colored muffin so be careful not to overbake. Let the
muffins cool in the pan for 2-3 minutes, then carefully remove and
place on a wire rack to cool.

NOTE: You can substitute two 4-oz jars of banana baby food (such as
Gerber) for the applesauce and use just 1 ripe banana. Or try other
baby food fruits such as pineapple, apple or plum.
