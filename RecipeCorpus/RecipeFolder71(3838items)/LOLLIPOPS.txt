Lollipops are best made on the day you wish to serve them.

Place corn syrup, water and sugar in small saucepan, stir over low
heat until sugar is dissolved. Brush sides of pan with a wet pastry
brush to dissolve sugar crystals. Increase heat, cook until syrup
reaches 150 degrees C when tested with a sweets thermometer or until
syrup reaches hard crack stage. Remove from heat, add a little
flavouring and colouring to syrup, stir through. Pour spoonfuls of
mixture in desired shapes onto foil-covered trays. Press a lollipop
stick into each shape; allow lollipops to cool at room temperature.

Makes about 10.

Flavouring & Colouring Suggestions

For one batch of syrup add 1/2 teaspoon of raspberry, orange, lime or
lemon flavouring and 1/2 teaspoon of red, orange, green, or yellow
colouring. Mixture can also be divided and flavoured and coloured, as
desired, to create multicolored lollipops.
