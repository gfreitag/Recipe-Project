Title: LIL'S THRILLS BBQ SAUCE
Categories: Chiles, Barbecue, Sauces
Yield: 1 Qt
8 lg Tomatoes
2    Mature (yellow)
Lemon drop chilles
1/4 c  Cider vinegar
3 cl Garlic, chopped
1/2 c  Unsulphured molasses
2 tb Orange marmalade
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 ts Powdered ginger
1/2 ts Ground mustard
1/4 ts Allspice
1/4 ts Celery seed
1/8 ts Powdered thyme
1    Bay leaf
Cook everything together for a few hours.  Remove bay leaf. Put in
food processor and blend it all together until it looks like sauce.

When you are cooking it down, you can tell pretty much when it will
make a good consistency sauce when processed. Cooking time depends on
how "watery" your tomatoes are. Walt MM Lillian Kepp
