Title: LOIN OF LAMB WITH APPLE & GINGER STUFFING
Categories: Ireland, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Loin of lamb, boned
2    Cloves garlic
Sea salt and pepper
2 c  Cider (preferably hard)
2    Cooking apples
Juice of 1 lemon
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Ground ginger
First make the stuffing.  Peel and core the apples, slice thinly and
put into a saucepan with the lemon juice, sugar and ginger. Cook over
a gentle heat until the apples are just soft, then set aside to cool.
. Preheat the oven for 400 F.  Trim the lamb, remove the skin and
score the fat. Lay the joint out on a board, fat side down. Spoon the
apple mixture along the center.  Roll up and tie with twine.  Peel
the garlic and cut it into slivers, then pierce the joint all over
with the point of a sharp knife and slip the slivers of garlic into
the pockets formed. Season with the salt and pepper, put the joint in
a roasting pan and cook in the hot oven for 30 minutes, then heat the
cider in a small pan and pour it over the lamb. Reduce the heat to
moderate (350F) and cook for another 40 minutes, basting frequently.
When the lamb is cooked, put it onto a heated serving dish and keep
warm.  Remove any excess fat from the pan juices, boil up over a high
heat until reduced slightly, and serve with the sliced lamb.
