Categories: Italian, Pork, Vegetables, Meats
Yield: 10 Servings
1 lb Dry lentils
Cold water
2 lb Fresh italian sausage, sweet
Or hot
About 3 cups homemade or
Canned chicken broth
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 sm Onion, finely chopped
1    Rib celery, finely chopped
1    Carrot, finely chopped
2    Cloves garlic, finely minced
8    Fresh sage leaves, chopped,
Or 1 tsp. dried, rubbed sage
Salt and pepper to taste
3 tb Tomato paste, diluted in a
Little water
Clean lentils well by soaking them briefly and changing the water at
least once.  Put them in a 2-1/2-quart saucepan, add cold water to
cover, and bring to a boil.  Lower heat to simmer and cook until not
quite done, about 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, pierce sausages in several places, and then put them in a
small saucepan.  Add enough chicken broth to cover, and place over
medium heat. Bring to a gentle boil, and simmer for about 40 minutes.
From time to time, skim off and discard foam and fat that rise to the
top. When sausages are done, remove the pot from the heat and let
them sit in the broth while you finish the lentils.

Warm the oil in a medium skillet, and saute' the onion, celery,
carrot, garlic and sage in the olive oil over medium heat until the
onion is translucent and the vegetables are done. Drain the lentils,
saving their liquid.  To the lentil pot, add the vegetables, season
with salt and pepper, and add tomato paste. Mix gently using a wooden
spoon. Add 3/4 cup of the broth in which you cooked the sausages.
Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed.

To serve, slice the sausages and arrange them on a platter next to
the warm lentils.
