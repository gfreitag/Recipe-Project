Title: KOBI-BATATA SHAAK
Categories: Vegetables, Indian
Yield: 2 Servings
1 tb Vegetable oil
2 ts Cumin or mustard seeds
2 1/2 c  Potatoes
-- cut into 3/4-inch pieces
1 c  Shredded green cabbage
-- or up to twice as much
1/2 ts Cumin powder
1 1/2 ts Coriander powder
1/2 ts Turmeric powder
1/2 ts Red chili powder
2 tb Fresh cilantro, chopped
3/4 ts Lemon juice
1/4 c  Tomatoes, chopped
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add
cumin or mustard seeds. Cook until seeds turn golden
brown (for cumin) or gray (for mustard) and release
their aroma, about 1 minute.  Seeds will "pop" as they
cook. Watch seeds closely to be sure they don't
overcook.

Add potatoes into the skillet.  Reduce heat to
medium-low, cover and continue cooking for 15 minutes.
Stir occasionally to prevent the potato mixture from
sticking to skillet.

Add cabbage and continue cooking until vegetables are
semi-tender. Add spices and stir to evenly coat
vegetables.  Cook until vegetables are tender, about
10 minutes.  Stir in cilantro, lemon juice and
tomatoes and serve immediately.
