Title: KOULOURAKIA (SPECIAL OCCASION COOKIES)
Categories: Bakery, Greek, Cookies, Vegetarian
Yield: 40 Cookies
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Ground cinnamon
3/4 c  Vegetable oil
3/4 c  Superfine sugar
3/4 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 c  Brandy
1 c  Sesame seeds
Preheat the oven to 400F.

Combine the flour and cinnamon in a bowl and set aside.

In a medium bowl, beat the oil and sugar with an
electric mixer until smooth and creamy.  In a cup,
dissolve the baking powder and baking soda in the
brandy, then add to the oil mixture.

Gradually add the flour until the dough is soft but
not sticky.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface
and knead until smooth.  Pinch off pieces of dough the
size of small walnuts and form into desired shapes.
Sprinkle with sesame seeds and place 1 inch apart on
greased cookie sheets. Bake for about 15 minutes, or
until golden brown.
