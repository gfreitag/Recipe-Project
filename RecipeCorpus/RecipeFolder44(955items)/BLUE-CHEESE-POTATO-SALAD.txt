Title: BLUE CHEESE POTATO SALAD
Categories: Salads
Mix together-----
Yield: 1 Servings  :
2 bn green onions  -- washed and
chopped
:
5    stalks celery  -- chopped
1/2 c  fresh dill  -- chopped
1 c  mayonnaise
1 c  sour cream
2 ts lemon juice
Salt and pepper to taste
Add about-----
:
:
1/2 c  crumbled blue cheese  -- to
3/4    and mix well

Let mixture sit overnight (very important), as the blue cheese needs
to blend with the dressing. Then, toss dressing with about 5 pounds
of cooked, cut potatoes, more salt, and a little vinegar. I use small
red potatoes, and then  cut them into quarters or sixths if they are
larger. I cut them first  and then cook them, just until they are
done, and then rinse them in cold water to stop cooking.  Then I
usually toss them with a little vinegar and salt - remember, potatoes
SOAK up salt.
