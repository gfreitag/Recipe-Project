1 c  Canned lite cherry pie filli
1/4 ts Almond extract
1 1/3 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1    (4-ounce) bar sweet
-  baking chocolate, melted
4    Egg whites
3 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/4 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa
1 2/3 c  Nonfat buttermilk
2 ts Vanilla extract
Vegetable cooking spray
1 1/2 ts Powdered sugar
Combine pie filling and almond extract; stir well, and set aside.
Combine 1-1/3 cups sugar and oil in a large bowl, beating well at
medium speed of an electric mixer. Add melted chocolate; beat well.
Add egg whites; beat well. Combine flour and next 3 ingredients; add
to sugar mixture alternately with buttermilk, beginning and ending
with flour mixture. Mix well after each addition. Stir in vanilla.
Reserve 2 cups of batter, and set aside. Pour remaining batter into
12-cup Bundt pan coated with cooking spray. Spoon pie filling mixture
over center of batter to form a ring. Top with reserved batter. Bake
at 350 degrees for 55 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in
center comes out clean. Cool in pan 10 minutes; remove from pan. Cool
on a wire rack. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Yield: 16 servings
(serving size: 1 slice). By all means use the vinegar or lemon juice
method to make buttermilk. I was going to suggest it when I posted
the recipe but forgot to. It should work just fine! 249 calories 23%
