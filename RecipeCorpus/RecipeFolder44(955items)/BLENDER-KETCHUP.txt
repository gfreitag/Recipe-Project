Procedure: Wash tomatoes and dip in boiling water for 30 to 60
seconds or until skins split. Then dip in cold water, slip off skins,
core, and quarter. Remove seeds from peppers and slice into strips.
Peel and quarter onions. Blend tomatoes, peppers, and onions at high
speed for 5 seconds in electric blender. Pour into a 3- to 4-gallon
stock pot or large kettle and heat. Boil gently 60 minutes, stirring
frequently. Add vinegar, sugar, salt, and a spice bag containing dry
mustard, red pepper, and other spices. Continue boiling and stirring
until volume is reduced one-half and ketchup rounds up on a spoon
with no separation of liquid and solids. Remove spice bag and fill
jars, leaving 1/8-inch headspace. Adjust lids and follow process
times for regular ketchup according to the recommendations in Table 1.
