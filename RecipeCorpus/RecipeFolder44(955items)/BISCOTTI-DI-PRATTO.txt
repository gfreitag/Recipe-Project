Title: BISCOTTI DI PRATTO
Categories: Breads, Italian
Yield: 6 Dozen
1/4 c  Almonds, blanched
3/4 c  Almonds, whole unblanched
4    Eggs, divided
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Almond extract
2 1/4 c  Flour
1 c  Sugar, white
1 ts Baking soda
1 pn Salt
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. On a baking sheet, roast blanched and
unblanched almonds until blanched almonds start to brown, shaking pan
occasionally; 5 to 8 minutes. Remove blanched almonds, place in
blender container and grind until it turns to powder. Set aside.
Meanwhile, return whole almonds to oven 2 to 3 minutes longer. Remove
and chop whole almonds roughly with knife, leaving large chunks. Set
aside. Turn oven down to 300 degrees. Grease baking sheet & dust with
flour; set aside. In a small bowl, beat 3 eggs, vanilla & extract. In
large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and ground
almonds. Make a well in the center and add the eggs, blending to
gradually incor- porate all of flour mixture. You should have a stiff
dough. If it is too stiff to hold together, add a little water.  Add
the crushed almonds and knead them evenly into the dough. Divide
dough into 3 portions. Form each into a long log, rounded or slightly
oval (about 1 1/2 inches in dia- meter). It will flatten as it bakes.
Place on prepared baking sheet. Bake 45 - 50 minutes. Remove from
oven and let rest 5 minutes. Turn oven down to 275 degrees. With a
serrated knife, cut logs into 3/4" slices. (NOTE: Unlike slicing a
loaf of bread, straight across its width, cut biscotti on a 45 degree
angle.) Lay slices flat on 2 baking sheets. Return to oven for 20 -
25 minutes, turning slices 1/2 way through baking time. Remove from
oven; allow to cool completely before sealing in containers. They
will stay fresh up to 1 month.
