Soak the black beans in 2 cups of water overnight, or combine them
with 2 cups of water in a saucepan, boil for 2 minutes, and let stand
1 hour. Cook in the soaking water over medium heat until very tender,
about 1 hour, then drain and pur e in a food processor or by putting
them through a potato ricer or coarse strainer.

In a skillet, heat the oil, and the onion, and cook until golden. Add
the garlic and cook 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms, cover, and cook 5
minutes. Uncover and cook until all the liquid has been absorbed.

Place the walnuts in a blender or food processor and grind to the
consistency of corn meal.

Remove the olive pits and discard, then chop the olives finely.

Combine all the ingredients except the pimento slices in a blender or
food processor and blend until fairly smooth, but not creamy. Turn
into a serving dish and chill. Garnish with pimento slices and serve
with Garlic and Herb Bread Chips (See recipe) or squares of toast.
