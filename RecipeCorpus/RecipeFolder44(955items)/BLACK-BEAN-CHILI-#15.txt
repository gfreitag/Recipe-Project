Categories: Beef, Pork, Beans, Chili, Tex-mex
Yield: 8 Servings
3 tb Vegetable oil
2 lg Onions; chopped
2    Green peppers; chopped
4    Cloves garlic; minced
1 lb Beef stew meat; cut into
-1-inch cubes
2 lb Boneless pork butt
1    28-oz can whole tomatoes;
-reserve liquid
1/4    To 1/3 cup chili powder
1    To 2 jalapeno chili peppers;
-chopped (remove seeds)
2 tb Ground cumin
ds Cayenne pepper
;salt (optional)
Freshly ground black pepper
2 c  Black beans; cooked
1/2 c  Dry red wine
Cheddar cheese; grated
Fresh cilantro; chopped
Red onions; chopped
Sour cream
Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 2 onions, bell
peppers, and garlic and saute until tender, about 14 minutes. Transfer
mixture to a bowl using a slotted spoon. Add beef and pork to pan and
cook over medium-high heat until meat is no longer pink, stirring
occasionally, approximately 8 minutes or so. Return onion mixture to
pan. Now add tomatoes with the reserved liquid, chili powder, chili
peppers, cumin, and cayenne pepper.  Season with salt (optional) and
pepper. Cover the pan and simmer until beef and pork are just about
tender (stir the pan every once in a while), about 1 hour.

Add black beans and the wine to chili.  Simmer uncovered until meat is
tender and the chili begins to thicken. This will probably take about
25 minutes. When chili is finished, ladle into bowls. Serve with
cheese, cilantro, red onions and sour cream in separate little bowls.

Judi's notes:  I usually add about 1/4 cup water or beef broth once or
twice during the cooking process if it appears too dry.
