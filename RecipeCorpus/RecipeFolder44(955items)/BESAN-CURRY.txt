Title: BESAN CURRY
Categories: Side dish, Indian, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 c  Chickpea flour
1 lg Tomato
1/4 c  Green peas
1 lg Potato
1 lg Onion
1/4 lb Ginger
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/4 ts Mustard powder
1/4 ts Cumin
1/4 ts Coriander
1 ts Turmeric
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
Mix chickpea flour with a little bit of water at a time, until you
have a thick batter.  Add salt and garlic powder.

Put a skillet over a low heat and heat oil.  Drop 1/2 teaspoon of
batter at a time into the oil.  When it turns golden brown, it it
done and with a srainer pick up the besan and put it on a dry pan.

Cut potatoes in small pieces and put them in a bowl. Chop onion up and
saute with 1 tablespoon of leftover oil. Add coriander, cumin,
turmeric, and mustard powders.

Add potatoes and mix thoroughly.  Add 1/4 cup of water.

Cut ginger into very small pieces and add to the curry.

While the curry is cooking, cut the tomato and add to the pan. Put
cover on.

When potato feels soft, add fried besan to the curry. Add salt.

The time you drop the potato in the pan to the time you drop the fried
besan into the pan should not be more then 15 minutes. As always, in
Indian cooking it is the preparation that takes time, not the cooking
itself.

Serve warm as a side dish.
