In a large bowl, stir together the cornstarch an 1/4 cup cold water
until cornstarch is completely dissolved. Add 1 cup sugar, lemon
juice, and blackberries, and combine the mixture gently but
thoroughly. Transfer to an 8-inch cast-iron skillet. In a bowl,
combine well the flour, remaining sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Blend in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 1/4
cup boiling water and stir the mixture until it just forms a dough.
Bring the blackberry mixture to a boil on top of the stove, stirring.
Drop spoonfuls of the dough carefully onto the boiling mixture, and
bake the cobbler on a foil lined baking sheet in the middle of a
preheated 400f oven for 20-25 minutes or until the topping is golden.
