Yield: 1 Servings

1 tb Dry yeast
5 c  Bread mix; up to six
1 1/2 c  -lukewarm water
2    Eggs; beaten
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1    Egg; beaten
2 tb Coarse salt
1/2 c  Butter; melted
Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets.  In a large bowl, dissolve
yeast in lukewarm water.  Blend in 2 eggs and butter. Add 5 cups
bread mix. Stir well.  Add additional bread mix to make a soft, but
not too sticky dough. Knead about 5 minutes until dough is smooth.
Roll pieces of dough into ropes about 1/2 inch in diameter and 18 to
24 inches long. Form into pretzel shapes.  For pretzel sticks, cut
dough into 5 to 6 inch lengths. Place on prepared baking sheets.
Preheat oven to 425.

Brush tops of pretzels with beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse salt.
Bake immediately 12 to 15 minutes, until brown and crisp. Makes 12 to
15 large pretzels.

Variation For a chewier pretzel, drop pretzel-shaped dough into a pan
of boiling water.  When dough floats to the top of the water, remove
it. Preheat oven to 400. Brush with egg and sprinkle with coarse
salt. Bake about 30 minutes.

All of these recipes I have posted using my bread mix can be adjusted
to use with the bread machine, some using the dough setting. I have
had excellent results. Will try to post more over the weekend as I
get time. Also have a lot of other "mix" recipes if anyone is
interested.
