Yield: 4 Dozen
1/4 c  Hazelnuts
1/2 c  Almonds
Zest of 1/4 lemon
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Dark brown sugar
1/4 ts Almond extract

The "Bis" means twice and "Cotti" means cooked --- and our recipe for
these crisp, cruncy cookies does just that. They are best when dipped
in hot coffee, cocoa or milk for a few seconds until softened, then
eaten right away.

Preheat oven to 400^.  Toast nuts until browned, about
8    minutes; let cool.

Use metal blade in food processor work bowl to finely chop zest and
granulated sugar, about 60 seconds.  Add brown sugar, extracts,
margarine and eggs; process until combined, about 5 seconds. Add nuts
and dry ingredients and pulse until combined, about 12 times.

Transfer dough to floured surface; roll into two 12" logs. Pat logs
to 2 1/2" wide.  Place 3" apart on lightly greased baking sheets.
Beat egg white slightly and brush over surface of logs. Bake 20
minutes until firm and lightly browned.  Remove from oven; reduce
heat to 325^. While still warm, cut logs diagonally into 1/2" slices,
lay cut side down on sheets. Bake 15 minutes more until dry. Cool on
whire racks.

Store in plastic food storage bag or tin for up to 1 month.
