Puree Beans with Tomatoes in food processor until it reaches the
desired texture.  For a crusty sandwich, spread slices of sourdough
french bread with a generous coating and top with slices of grilled
eggplant and provolone cheese.

For a nice appetizer, use thin slices from a skinny French loaf, pop
into the oven to melt the cheese, and serve hot.
