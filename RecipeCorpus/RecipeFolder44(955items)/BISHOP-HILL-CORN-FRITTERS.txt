Title: BISHOP HILL CORN FRITTERS
Categories: None
Yield: 18 Fritters
2 lg EGGS
1/4 c  MILK
1/4 c  WATER
1 tb BUTTER, melted
16 oz Can WHOLE KERNEL CORN,
-drained (I use the drained
-juices instead of the water
-or add water to the juice
-to make 1/4 cup)
2 c  ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR

3/4 ts SALT

1 tb GRANULATED SUGAR
VEGETABLE OIL (for frying)
CONFECTIONERS' SUGAR & MAPLE

* Instead of canned corn, 2 cups fresh or frozen corn can be
substituted. The original recipe does call for canned corn, as
fritters were considered a winter dish. And this recipe is much older
than frozen technology.

In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs until light. Add the milk (or corn
liquid mixed with water), and butter; blend. Stir in the corn and mix
thoroughly. Add the dry ingredients and mix just until moistened.

Heat 2 inches of oil in an electric skillet or deep-fryer to
350-degreesF. Drop the batter into the oil by tablespoonfuls and fry
2 to 3 minutes on each side or until nicely browned. Drain on paper
towel and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve with maple syrup.
