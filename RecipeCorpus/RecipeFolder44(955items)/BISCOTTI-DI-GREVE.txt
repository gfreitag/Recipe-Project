Categories: Cookies
Yield: 48 Servings
2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
2 lg Whole eggs
1 lg Egg yolk
1 ts Vanilla
1 tb Freshly grated orange zest
1 1/2 c  Natural whole almonds,
-toasted lightly and
Chopped coarse
An egg wash made by beating
-together 1
1 lg Egg and 1 teaspoon water
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment
blend the flour, the sugar, the baking soda, and the salt until the
mixture is combined well. In a small bowl whisk together the whole
eggs, the yolk, the vanilla, and the zest, add the mixture to the
flour mixture, beating until a dough is formed, and stir in the
almonds.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, knead it several
times, and halve it. Working on a large buttered and floured baking
sheet, with floured hands form each piece of dough into a flattish
log 12 inches long and 2 inches wide, arrange the logs at least 3
inches apart on the sheet, and brush them with the egg wash. Bake the
logs in the middle of a preheated 300 degree oven for 50 minutes and
let them cool on the baking sheet on a rack for 10 minutes. On a
cutting board cut the logs crosswise on the diagonal into 1/2-inch-
thick slices, arrange the biscotti, cut sides down, on the baking
sheet, and bake them in the 300 degree oven for 15 minutes on each
side. Transfer the biscotti to racks to cool and store them in
airtight containers. Makes about 48 biscotti.
