Categories: Bisquick, Cakes, Pumpkin, Share
Yield: 1 servings
3 c  Bisquick baking mix
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Brown sugar; packed
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
4    Eggs
1    Pumpkin
1/4 c  Milk
2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ginger
1/4 ts Cloves
1/4 ts Nutmeg
MMMMM---------------------BROWN BUTTER GLAZE--------------------------
1/3 c  Butter
2 c  Powdered sugar
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
2 tb Hot water; can use up to 6
-tbsp.
Heat oven to 350F.  Grease and flour a 12-cup Bundt cake pan.  Beat
all ingredients except Brown Butter Glaze in large mixer bowl on low
speed, scraping bowl several times, for 30 seconds.  Beat on med.
speed, scraping bowl occasionally, for three min.  Spread batter in
pan.  Bake until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean,
about 50 min.  Cool 10 min. Remove from pan.  Cool completely.
Drizzle with Brown Butter Glaze.

BROWN BUTTER GLAZE: Heat butter over med. heat until delicate brown.
Real butter works best for this; margarine is Ok, but butter
substitutes are not.  Blend in powdered sugar and vanilla. Stir in
enough hot water to make proper consistency for drizzling over cake
(usually only 2-3 tbsps.).
