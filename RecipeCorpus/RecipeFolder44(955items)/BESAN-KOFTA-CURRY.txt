Koftas: Mix together besan, salt, chili powder, ghee (or oil),
pomegranate and cumin seeds.  Grind onions to a very fine paste and
add to besan mixture. Knead dough; it will be very stiff. Roll dough

set aside. Prepare curry sauce: Grind onion and garlic to a paste.
Heat ghee and fry onion and garlic paste until golden brown.  Add
spices, and cook for another minute, then add tomatoes and cook until
ghee (or oil) begins to rise to the surface. Add 1 cup water, then
cook until mixture is almost dry. Using a wooden spoon, mash mixture
to a paste.  Add 2 more cups of water, bring to a boil. Add koftas to
sauce and simmer over low heat another 5 minutes or so. Garnish with
chopped coriander leaves and serve.
