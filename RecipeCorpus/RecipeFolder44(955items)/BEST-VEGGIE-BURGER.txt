the tang of a Granny Smith apple to the wonderful crunch of fresh
vegetables.

finely.  Cook cracked wheat in 1 cup boiling water for 1 minute.
Remove from heat and cover. grate the zucchini, carrot, and apple.
Place shreds in a dish towel and squeeze out excess moisture. Combine

garlic, tahini, curry powder, chili powder, salt, pepper, and canola
oil until smooth. Add to shredded mixture. Drain cracked wheat into
strainer, pressing with back of spoon to extract excess liquid.  Add
to bowl with vegetables. Add bread crumbs. Refrigerate for one hour.
