Title: BISCUITS & SAUSAGE GRAVY
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 5 Servings
1 lb Bulk pork sausage, sage flav
2 tb Onion; finely chopped
6 tb Flour
1 qt Milk
1/2 ts Poultry seasoning
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/4 ts Salt
1 ds Worcestershire sauce
1 ds Hot pepper sauce
1 cn Ready-to-bake biscuit dough

1. Place sausage in a large, heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Cook,
stirring and breaking the sausage into small chunks with a fork, until
cooked, about 10 minutes.

2. Add onion; cook until soft and transparent, about 4 minutes. Drain,
discarding all but 2 tablespoons of drippings. Return skillet to heat.

3. Sprinkle flour over sausage and stir to coat. Continue cooking over
medium-low heat, stirring until flour forms a golden-brown crust on
the bottom of the skillet, about 3 minutes.

4. Add milk, poultry seasoning, nutmeg, salt, Worcestershire sauce,
and hot pepper sauce. Cook, stirring, until thickened, about 5
minutes, scraping up and incorporating the browned crust from bottom
of pan. Reduce heat to low, cover and keep warm.

5. Bake biscuits according to package directions.

6. To serve, split biscuits crosswise and place on individual plates.
Ladle hot sausage gravy over biscuits and serve immediately.
