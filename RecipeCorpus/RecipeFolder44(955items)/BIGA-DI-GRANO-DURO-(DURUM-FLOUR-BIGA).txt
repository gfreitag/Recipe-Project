Title: BIGA DI GRANO DURO (DURUM FLOUR BIGA)
Categories: Bakery, Italian, Breads
Yield: 2 Cups
1/2 ts Dried yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
1 c  Water at room temperature
2 1/4 c  Golden durum flour
Stir the yeast into the warm water in a large bowl & let proof for 10
minutes.  Add the rest of the water & the flour 1 c at a time, mixing
vigorously after each addition. Continue to mix for about 6 minutes.
The mixture will clear the sides of the bowl but remain soft &
sticky. Cover with plastic wrap & leave to rise at room temperature
for 24 hours. The starter will triple in volume & then collapse a
little. Cover & refrigerate until ready to use. To use the biga,
scoop out the needed amount while it is still cold & hasn't begun to
grow & expand at room temperature. NOTE: Ensure that you use golden
durum flour & not durum integrale which contains the whole husk of
the wheat berry & is not right for this recipe.
