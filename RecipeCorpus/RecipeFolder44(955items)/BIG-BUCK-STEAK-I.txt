Title: BIG BUCK STEAK I
Categories: Wildgame
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Round steak, 1-1/2 to 2 in.
6 tb Flour
1 cn Mushroom soup
Salt & pepper to taste
2 tb Frying fat
If you kill a big buck and know he will not be as tender as my
spikehorns, cut a round steak about 2 inches thick, dredge in flour,
let stand for an hour and then reflour the wet spots. Sear on both
sides in a hot, lightly-greased skillet or black iron pot. Now pour
the can of soup directly onto the center of the steak, then add
enough hot water to cover the meat. Cover the pot or skillet, cook in
a moderate (375) oven for about 2 hours or until tender. Suggestions:
TRY adding cutup turnips and fresh green beans around the meat, just
before pouring the mushroom soup on. Recipe date: 01/15/87
