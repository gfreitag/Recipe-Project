Title: BLUE CORN TORTILLA STACK
Categories: New text im, Too hot tam
3 c  Salsa de Chile Colorado
Yield: 4 Servings
12    blue corn tortillas
Vegetable oil
:
2 c  Chicken -- Cooked And Diced
2 c  grated Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 c  pine nuts toasted
Cilantro -- finely diced
:
1/2    red onion -- diced
12    limes -- cut into wedges

Make the Salsa de Chile Colorado: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In
a mediumsize skillet, over a medium heat, fry each tortilla in a
little of the oil until just cooked, but not crisp. Dip each
tortilla, as you build the stacks, quickly into the Salsa de Chile
Colorado, just to moisten. In an ovenproof baking dish large enough
to hold 4 of the blue corn tortillas, side by side without touching,
place the first 4 tortillas. Top each tortilla with 1/4 cup of the
cooked chicken. Top the chicken with 1/4 cup of the grated cheese.
Sprinkle the cheese with 1 teaspoon of the pine nuts and 1 teaspoon
of the cilantro. Repeat layering 4 tortillas, 1/4 cup chicken, 1/4
cup cheese, 1 teaspoon pine nuts, and 1 teaspoon cilantro and finally
top with the last 4 tortillas. You should have 4 stacks. Pour the
remaining Salsa de Chile Colorado over all the stacks. Bake for about
15 to 20 minutes. Transfer each stack to a plate, garnish with the
red onion and the lime wedges, and serve immediately. Yield: 4
