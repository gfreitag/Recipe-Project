Categories: Breads, Italian
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 ts Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
3/4 c  Water; room temperature
1 tb Water; room temperature
1 ts Water; room temperature
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
Recipe by: Carol Field - The Italian Baker Stir the yeast into the
warm water and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the
remaining water and then the flour, 1 cup at a time.

Mix with a wooden spoon for about 3 to 4 minutes.

Remove to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise
at a cool room temperature for 6 to 24 hours. The starter will triple
in volume and still be wet and sticky when ready. Cover and
refrigerate until ready to use.  When needed, scoop out desired
amount.
