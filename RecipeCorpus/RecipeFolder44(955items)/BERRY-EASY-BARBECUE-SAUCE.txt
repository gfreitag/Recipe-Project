Cranberries account for the little ruby-colored chunks in the McDaniel
family's barbecue sauce.  Use if for ribs, pork chops, chicken, or
ham.

1.  Combine all the ingredients in a 2 quart saucepan. Bring to
boiling;
reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.

2.  Brush on meat or chicken at end of grilling time.

Makes 3 1/2 cups of sauce - enough for 18 - 21 pounds of ribs.
