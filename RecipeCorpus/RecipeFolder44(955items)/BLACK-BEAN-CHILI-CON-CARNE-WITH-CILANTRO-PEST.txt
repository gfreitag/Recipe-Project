Cut carrots, celery and bell peppers into strips about 1-1/2 inches
long then julienne. Julliene the cheese or grate with long strokes.

Brown and crisp the meat:  Slice the beef into very thin 2-inch
strips. Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over
medium-high heat, and brown the beef in batches. Brown the ground
pork. When all the meat is well browned, drain off fat and put the
meat back into the pan. Continue to brown for another few minutes
until the meat is beginning to get crisp. Sprinkle with salt, add the
chili powder, and allow it to cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside until needed.

Brown some vegetables:  In a large cast iron pot or casserole, heat
the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Saute the onions over medium heat
until they begin to wilt, about 5 minutes.Add the carrots, celery,
and red pepper and saute 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook another
minute.

Combine: Lower the heat. Scrape the meat into the pot with the onion
mixture. Heat the (meat's) skillet again over medium high heat and
pour in the wine. Scrape up the browned bits and reduce wine for a
minute or so. Pour into the casserole with the meat and vegetables.

Add the tomatoes, water, molasses, sage, and cumin to the pot. Simmer,
covered, for 1-1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add the black beans,
drained if using canned, and season with salt if needed. Cook another
15    minutes.

Serve: Put a dollop of Cilantro Pesto on each serving, and service the
garnishes on the side.
