"These "blue chips" are definitely a good investment that produce
profitable returns in the form of compliments from all who try them.
The texture is light and lacy, and the blue cheese flavor mellows
with baking. Try serving them with a dry white wine. 305~F. 20 to 25
minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F. Cream the butter and cheese
together in the food processor, or in a large bowl using a pastry
blender or two kinves. In another bowl, stir together the flour,
buckwheat groats or nuts (if desired) and pepper. Add the flour
mixture to the butter-cheese mixture and blend well.

Blend in the milk, little by little, to form a dough that will hold
together in a cohesive ball. The dough should be quite stiff. Divide
it into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry
cloth, roll out to about 3/16 inch thick. Cut into 1-1/2-inch circles
and place on an ungreased baking sheet, making sure the edges do not
touch. Prick each cracker in 1 or 2 places with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 15 minutes, turn, and bake for an additional 5 to 10
minutes, or until medium brown. Yield: 130-40.
