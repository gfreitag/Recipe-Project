Carefully fold the crab meat into the mixture. Let the mixture sit
for 1/2 hour in the refrigerator.

For the mixture into patties.

In a large skillet place the butter and heat it on medium until it has
melted.  SautÂ‚ the crab cakes for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or
until they are golden brown.

For CAYENNE MAYONNAISE:  In a blender place the roasted red bell
pepper, egg yolks, white wine vinegar, lemon juice, capers, garlic,
anchovy fillets, and cayenne pepper. Blend the ingredients together
so that they are smooth.

With the blender still running, slowly dribble in the salad oil so
that a mayonnaise is formed.  Correct the seasoning with the salt
(and more lemon juice) if necessary.

Serve the crab cakes with the Cayenne Mayonnaise and lemon wedges. ---
