Place the drained black-eyed peas in a saucepan with the ham hock
broth or water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until
tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Toward the end of the cooking time,
taste the peas and season with salt.  Drain and set aside.

In a skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until all the fat
is rendered.  Transfer the bacon to a large mixing bowl and add the
crabmeat, vegetables, peas, and herbs. Mix together until thoroughly
combined.

Combine the salad with the vinaigrette.  Mound the tossed salad on a
large serving platter, leaving at least 2 inches around the edge of
the platter. Arrange the grapefruit sections around the salad, and
garnish the grapefruit sections with the cilantro springs.

Chef's Notes:  Chef Stephan Pyles of Star Canyon tells us that "This
easy, do-ahead salad is a perfect entree for a summer lunch or
picnic. Black-eyed peas, crab, and grapefruit may not exactly be an
orthodox combination, but they are all staples of Texas cookery and
go well together. " Entered into MasterCook by Terri Law, 8/22/96.
