Title: BIGOS (SAUERKRAUT STEW)
Categories: Polish, Stews
Yield: 6 Servings
4    Mushroom, dried
1/4 c  ;Water
2 lb Sauerkraut
1 lg Apple; peeled/cored/sliced
20 oz Tomato; canned
5    Peppercorn
1    Bay leaf
1 lb Polish sausage; diced
1 lb Stewing beef
1 c  Bacon; coarsely chopped
Soak the mushrooms in 1/4 cup water for 2 hours. Bring to boil and
simmer for 1/2 hour. Slice.

Wash the sauerkraut and sqeeze it. Add mushrooms and the liquid in
which they were cooked. Add the apples, the tomatoes, peppercorns and
bay leaf. Cover and simmer for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Add the meat
and the bacon. Simmer 1 hour longer.

My method differs a little bit. I rinse the sauerkraut and simmer it
for about a 1/2 hour. In a separate pot I simmer the stewing beef for
the same amount of time with whatever spices happen to fall into my
hands at the time, including the peppercorns and the bay leaf.
Meanwhile, in a large fry pan I fry the bacon, a large diced onion,
the Polish sausage and the mushrooms. Then I drain the sauerkraut and
mix it into the beef. Into that I mix in the bacon mixture. Then I
simmer all that for about another hour.

This dish tastes best reheated the next day. Serve with steamed
potatoes or rye bread. Excellent for banquets and buffet
entertaining. It also freezes well.
