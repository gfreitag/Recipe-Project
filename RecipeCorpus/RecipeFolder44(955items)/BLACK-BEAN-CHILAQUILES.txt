Yield: 8 Servings
12    Corn Tortillas
1    Onion chopped
10 fl Stock
3    Cloves garlic crushed
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Ground cumin seed
1/2 ts Chilli powder

8 oz Mozarella cheese finely d

6 tb Parmesan cheese

1.  Pre-heat oven to 300 degrees F, 150 degrees C, gas mark 2.

2.  Bake the tortillas directly on the oven shelf for 15 to 20
minutes, turning once until crisp right through. They will break with
a clean snap. Break into coarse pieces and set aside.

3.  Spread onion pieces out in a heavy frying pan. Cook over moderate
heat without stirring until the onions are sizzling and beginning to
stick to the pan. Stir in the stock and let it bubble up, stirring up
the browned deposits in the pan as it bubbles.  Stir in the garlic
and the spices. Turn the heat down and simmer, stirring frequently
until the mixture is thick, not at all soupy, and the onions and
spices are frying in their own juices. Don't rush this step.  It is
essential that the spices should not have a harsh raw taste.

4.  Stir in the black beans and heat gently.  Mash roughly while
still in the pan, with a potato masher. You want a rough lumpy
mixture, not a smooth puree. Set aside.

5.  In a gratin dish spread a layer of a third of the tortilla pieces.
Spread a layer of the black beans over the tortillas and spread a
third of the tomato sauce over the black beans. Sprinkle with one
third of the cheeses.  Repeat this, ending with a layer of the beans,
sauce and cheeses.

6.  Bake for 30 minutes covered.  Uncover, and bake for 5 to 10
minutes more.  Serve garnished with lime wedges.
