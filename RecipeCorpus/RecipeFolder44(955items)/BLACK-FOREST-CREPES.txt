Title: BLACK FOREST CREPES
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 18 Servings
Chocolate cr=EApes
Kirsch or sherry (optional)
19 oz Cherry pie filling
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1/8 ts Nutmeg=7F
Whipped cream
Sprinkle cr=EApes with kirsch or sherry.

Mix cherry pie filling, sugar and nutmeg together. Spoon about 2 tbsp.
close to one side of cr=EApe. Roll. Allow 2 per serving. Lay on plate
with edge down. Top with whipped cream.

Note:  My personal feeling is that the sugar is not needed.
