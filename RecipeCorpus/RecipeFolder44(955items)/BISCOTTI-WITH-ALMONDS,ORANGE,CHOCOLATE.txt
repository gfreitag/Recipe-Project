Categories: Biscotti, Chocolate
Yield: 60 Servings
8 oz Unsalted butter -- 2 sticks
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3 tb Orange rind -- finely
Grated
2 tb Vanilla extract -- pure
Vanilla
6 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Salt
6    Eggs -- beaten
1/4 c  Amaretto
2 c  Almonds, blanched -- toasted
Sliced
2 c  Chocolate chips -- or
Pieces
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In an electric mixing bowl, combine
butter, sugar, orange peel and vanilla; beat until light and creamy.
Sift together the dry ingredients. With the mixer on slow, add dry
ingredients to butter mixture and mix until thoroughly combined.
Slowly add eggs and amaretto. Add almonds and chocolate just until
combined. Remove dough to a floured surface and form into two flat
logs about 4 inches wide and the length of your cookie sheet.  Lay
the logs onto buttered sheets and place on lower rack of the oven.
Bake until lightly browned, about 45 minutes. Remove to a rack to
cool.    With a serrated knife, cut the loaves into half-inch slices,
placing the cut slices flat oon the cookie sheet. To make crisp,
return them to the lower rack of the oven and cook until golden,
15-20 minutes. Remove the slices to a wire rack to cool then store in
an airtight container.  Use a decorative tin for gift giving. NOTE:
If the biscotti lose their crispness, repeat the crisping stage. Jo
