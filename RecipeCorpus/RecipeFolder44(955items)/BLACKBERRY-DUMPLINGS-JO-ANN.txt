Sift together flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in shortening
with a pastry blender until mixture resembles large coarse crumbs.
Sprinkle water over flour mixture, using a fork to stir it in gently
to make it gather into a ball (the less water the better ~ just
enough to hold it together). Turn out onto a lightly floured board
and shape with your hands into two balls, one slightly larger than
the other. Chill dough for 1 hour, then roll out ball to a  8" or 9"
circle.
Now, mix sugar, butter and all-purpose flour in a separate bowl,
then add a dash of salt and stir in berries.
Mix some of the "crushed berries" into the simple syrup.
Mound about a cup of the berry mixture onto the circle of dough,
fold over the edges to enclose the filling.
Repeat until all dough and berries are used.
Preheat oven to 350f degrees.
The enclosed bundles of berries are placed in a 9x13 baking pan.
Over this a syrup is poured to the depth of the first knuckle of my
grandmother's index finger (maybe about one inch). I'm guessing it
was a simple sugar syrup, but maybe with the addition of some smashed
blackberries. All of this was cooked in a 350 degree oven until it
looked REALLY good--brown and bubbly--with the whole house smelling
heavenly. Seenote; Simple Syrup
2 1/2    cups sugar
3/4    cups light corn syrup
1 1/4    cups water Combine all ingredients in a large saucepan.
Stir over low heat until sugar is completely dissolved. When clear,
wash down sides of pan with a brush dipped in cold water. Cover
saucepan for 5 minutes to allow steam to dissolve any remaining sugar
crystals. Uncover and increase the heat. Boil without stirring for 5
minutes. cool, pour into jars, and cover tightly. Store at room
temperature. Makes about 2 3/4 cups.
