Title: BLOATER SAVOURY(ENGLISH)
Categories: Fish/sea, English
Yield: 2 Servings
2    Bloaters
2 oz Butter, softened
2 ts Worcestershire sauce
Cayenne pepper to taste
2    Egg yolks
A squeeze of Lemon juice
Grill the bloaters on both sides, then remove the skin and bones and
flake the flesh. Add the butter to the fish and blend well. Stir in
the Worcestershire sauce and cayenne pepper. Bind with the egg yolks
and lemon juice. Sieve to produce a smooth paste and turn into a
dish. Serve with fingers of hot toast or Suffolk Rusks.

This hot spicy paste was very popular in Edwardian times, when it was
served with toast or Suffolk Rusks as an appetizer or a savoury. If
bloaters are not available, it can be made with smoked mackerel.
