Hard boil the eggs.  Slice the onion and chilli. Shell the eggs,
sprinkle with the turmeric and salt and prick all over with a skewer
to allow spices to get into the eggs. Heat the oil and deep fry the
eggs until they turn a light golden brown. Drain and remove. Put the
coconut milk in a pan and add the onion, chilli, chilli powder, cumin
powder, coriander powder, fennel powder and cinnamon stick. Cook over
a low heat until the onion is soft. Cut the eggs in half, add to the
pan and simmer for a further 2 minutes. Discard the cinnamon stick
before serving.
