Title: BLAEBERRY JAM
Categories: Jams, Fruits
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM-------------------------MAKES 3 LB------------------------------
2 lb Blaeberries
1/2 lb Rhubarb
2 lb Preserving sugar
(AKAs Bilberries, Whortleberries, Blueberries, Huckleberries) Wash,
trim and roughly chop the rhubarb, put it into a pan and cook gently
until it starts to soften. Stir in the sugar and when it has
dissolved add the blaeberries and bring the jam to the boil. Boil it
rapidly for up to 20 minutes to setting point. Cool slightly then
pour into clean warm jars, cover, label and store. (Test for setting
point: test the jam by placing a spoonful on a plate, letting it cool
and then pushing the surface with your finger: if it wrinkles the jam
is ready)
