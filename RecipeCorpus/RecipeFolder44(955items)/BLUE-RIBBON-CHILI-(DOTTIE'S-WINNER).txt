1.  In a small dry skillet, toast the cumin seeds over moderate heat,
stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Grind the cumin
in a spice mill or a mortar. 2. Heat a large enameled cast-iron
casserole. Season the brisket with salt and pepper.  Working in
batches, add the meat to the casserole and cook over moderately high
heat until well-browned all over, about 8 minutes. Transfer each
batch to a large plate. 3. Add the garlic, jalapenos and onions to
the casserole and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally,
until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the commercial chili powder and
pure red chile powder, coriander and half of the ground cumin and
cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. 4. Return the cooked brisket to the
casserole and add the beef stock, beer, tomatoes and their liquid,
and the oregano.  Bring to a boil over moderately high heat, then
lower the heat and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours.
Stir in the ground chuck, season with salt and cook until the brisket
is very tender and the sauce is thickened, about 1 hour longer. Stir
in the remaining cumin and simmer for 15 minutes. Garnish with the
scallions and serve. Note:  Rathern than the commercial chili, you
can use Reno Red Chili Mix, available by mail order from Stewart's
Chili Company, P. O. Box 574, San Carlos, CA 94070  DOTTIE, in
