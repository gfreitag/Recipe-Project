Categories: Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
1 tb Freshly ground black pepper
1 tb Ground white pepper
1 tb Salt
1 tb Dry mustard
1 tb Paprika
2 ts Cayenne pepper
1 ts Dried fennel
1/2 ts Dried oregano
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1/3 c  Unsalted butter
2 x  Gloves garlic, minced
2 1/2 lb Sirloin steak,

Make seasoning mix by combinning in a bowl the salt and all the
spices. Melt butter with garlic and place in a flat dish. Prepare
barbecue. Dip steak in garlic butter, then pat seasoning mix onto
both sides of meat. Brush grill with oil and barbecue steak for 8
minutes per side for rare meat. Steak will blacken as it cooks and a
lot of smoke will be created by the seasoning mix. Remove steak from
grill to hot platter and let stand for 5 minutes. Slice thinly on the
diagonal. SERVES 6.
