Risottos make some of the best supper dishes of all - satisfying,
tasty food that you can make all the year round using whatever are
the best vegetables in season. Serve this risotto with a crisp tossed
salad and some warm granary bread.

Soften the chopped onion in the oil for 5 minutes, then stir in the
rice and mix until well coated with the oil. Stir in the herbs. Then
add the stock gradually, stirring until the rice absorbs the liquid,
and then adding more as required. When it has all been absorbed, mix
in all the prepared vegetables and cook gently, stirring, until they
are hot and cooked through.

Season to taste and stir in the cheese. When it has melted, serve the
risotto on hot plates, with grated Parmesan to sprinkle on top.
