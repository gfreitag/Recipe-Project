Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Blackberries

1/3 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1/4 c  Molasses

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
3 tb Butter; cold
1 tb Vegetable oil
1    Egg; lightly beaten
1/4 c  Milk
1    Egg yolk; for the glaze
Preheat the oven to 375 F. Wash the berries carefully and combine
them with the sugar, spices, molasses and lemon juice. Transfer to a
deep, 9-inch baking dish. Prepare the biscuit topping: Sift the flour
with the baking powder and salt. Cut the butter and oil with a pastry
blender or with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse
crumbs. Stir together the egg and 1 tablespoon of the milk if
necessary to form a soft dough. Roll the dough out lightly on a
floured surface to about 1/2-inch thick and stamp out circles of
dough, using a biscuit cutter. Cover the berries with the dough
circles. Make a glaze by combining the egg yolk with the remaining
milk and brush this mixture over the surface of the dough. Bake,
uncovered, in the preheated oven for 25 minutes until nicely browned.
Serve alone hot, or at room temperature with a small scoop of creme
fraiche, whipped cream or ice cream.
