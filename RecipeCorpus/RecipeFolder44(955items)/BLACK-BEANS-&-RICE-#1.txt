any meat frm the bone and return the meat to the beans. 5. Before
serving, heat the beans through and stir in the cooked rice and lime
juice.  Serve in in shallow bowls. As this dish sets, it tends to
thicken so that you may have to add a bit more chicken broth before
serving. Store covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. serves
