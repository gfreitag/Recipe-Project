Title: BEST COFFEE CAKE!!!!
Categories: Cakes, Brunch, Desserts, Bundt
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM-------------------BELINDA WEST (SSJG51B------------------------
1 pk Yellow cake mix
4    Eggs
1 c  Apricot nectar
1 c  Wesson Oil
1/4 ts Lemon extract
MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
3    Lemons; juiced
1 c  Powdered sugar
Mix ingredients and pour into greased tube pan.  Bake approximately 30
minutes at 350 degrees.  ICING: mix lemon juice and powdered sugar.
While still warm, Punch cake with skewer (or a chopstick) to make
holes, pour icing on top. When cool, sprinkle with powdered sugar.
NOTE: I have had this baked as a sheet cake and cut into squares. It
is a great coffeecake, and good enough to be used as a dessert, as
well.
