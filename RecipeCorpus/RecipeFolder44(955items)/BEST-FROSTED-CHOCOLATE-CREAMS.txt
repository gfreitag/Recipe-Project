Cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add eggs,
melted chocolate, and vanilla; mix well.

Combine soda and flour together. Alternately add flour mixture and
milk to egg batter, beating well after each addition.

Drop by teaspoonfuls, 2" apart, onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake 8
to 10 min., or until dull on top and firm to the touch. Remove
cookies from sheets immediately and cool on rack.

To frost:  Melt chocolate and butter in saucepan; remove from heat.
Stir in sugar, vanilla, and enough cream to become spreading
consistency.

Frost cookies after they are completely cool(but frosting should
still be slightly warm).  With table knife or small spatula, swirl
frosting around top of cookie.Place a perfect pecan half on top
before frosting is set. Let frosting set while cookies are on rack.

Store in cookie tin, placing waxed paper between layers of cookies.
