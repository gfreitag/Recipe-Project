Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Lb
-JUDI M. PHELPS
2 c  Sugar
1    Can (5-oz) evaporated milk
1/3 c  Milk
1/8 ts Salt
1/4 c  Butter
1 ts Vanilla extract
Broken nuts (optional)
Line an 8x4x2-inch loaf pan with foil, extending foil over edges of
pan. Butter foil; set aside.

Butter the sides of a heavy 2-quart saucepan.  In saucepan combine
sugar, evaporated milk, milk, and salt.  Cook and stir over
medium-high heat to boiling.  Carefully clip a candy thermometer to
the side of the saucepan. Cook and stir over medium-low-heat to 238
degrees, soft-ball stage (this should take 25 to 35 minutes).

Immediately remove saucepan from heat.  Add butter and vanilla, but
do not stir.  Cool mixture, without stirring, to 110 degrees,
lukewarm (about 55 minutes).  Remove candy thermometer from saucepan.
Beat vigorously with a wooden spoon till fudge becomes very thick and
just starts to lose its gloss (about 10 minutes total). Do not
overbeat.

Immediately spread fudge into the prepared pan.  Score into 1-inch
squares while warm.  Top each square with a piece of nut, if desired.
When candy is firm, use the foil to lift the fudge out of the pan.
Cut into squares. Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator. Makes
about 1 lb (32 servings).
