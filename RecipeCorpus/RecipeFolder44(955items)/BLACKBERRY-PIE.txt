Categories: Pies
Yield: 8 Servings
1 3/4 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
2/3 c  Vegetable shortening
1/3 c  Cold water
1 c  Sugar
1/4 c  All-purpose flour

4 c  Fresh blackberries,
1 x  Washed and drained
Sift together flour and salt in a mixing bowl.Cut in shortening
with a pastry blender until mixture resembles large coarse crumbs.
Sprinkle water over flour mixture,using a fork to stir it in gently
to make it gather into a ball (the less water the better - just
enough to hold it together).Turn out onto a lightly floured board and
shape with your hands into two balls,one slightly larger than the
other.Chill dough for 1 hour,then roll out large ball to fit the
bottom of a 9 or 10" pie dish.Now,mix sugar and all-purpose flour in
a separate bowl,then add a dash of salt and stir in berries.Pour
mixture into the empty pie shell,then roll out remaining ball of
dough to make top crust.Crimp and trim edges,then slash the top crust
in several places.Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 25 to 30
minutes or until golden brown.Makes 1 - 10" pie.
