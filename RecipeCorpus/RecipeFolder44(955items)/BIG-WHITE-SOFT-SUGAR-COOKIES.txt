Title: BIG WHITE SOFT SUGAR COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Buttermilk
1 1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
1 ts Baking soda
2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Vegetable oil
3 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3 c  Unbleached flour
2    Eggs
Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
Seedless raisins

In a measuring cup, mix the buttermilk and baking soda; set aside. In
a large mixer bowl, combine the oil, sugar, and eggs; mix well. Add
the buttermilk-soda mixture and blend.  Then add the salt, nutmeg,
vanilla, and baking powder and mix again. Blend in the flour (the
batter will be very runny). Cover and refrigerate overnight. The next
day, preheat oven to 400 F.  For the very best results, use ungreased
non-stick baking sheets. Dark or shiny sheets conduct the heat
differently, and the cookie will have crisp brown edges, which are
just what you don't want. Use 1 heaping tablespoon of batter per
cookie, and place them on the sheets. Liberally sprinkle more sugar
on top of each cookie and dot with 3 raisins. Keep batter
refrigerated between bakings. Bake for just 5 minutes. The cookies
should be just barely done--still almost white. If they are golden,
you have left them in too long.  Remove from oven, and allow the
cookies to remain on the cookie sheet for 3 more minutes to continue
baking. Carefully remove cookies with a metal spatula to a wax
paper-covered rack to cool. The cookies keep well in tightly covered
containers or can be frozen. In either case, each cookie should be
wrapped individually or between layers of wax paper.  They are so
tender, so moist, so cakelike that they cling together if this is not
done.
