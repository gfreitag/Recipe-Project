1 ts Oil

1/2 lb Chicken
- cut into small pieces
3 tb Oil
1 lg Onion chopped

Wash rice and put in a small saucepan with all above ingredients.
Bring it to a boil on high heat, then cover and simmer gently until
all the water is absorbed. The grains should be tender but firm. Set
aside uncovered. Heat oil in a large saucepan (medium heat), add
onions and fry till golden around the edges, add garlic and ginger.
All at once add all the spices and fry one minute longer. Add all
other ingredients except saffron. Add salt to taste. Cover and cook
on low heat till chicken is tender, stirring occasionally (about 1/2
hour). There should be very little liquid remaining in the pan.
(During cooking a little water may be added if necessary to avoid
sticking). Add half the prepared rice, spreading it evenly over the
mixture, drizzle one tbsp of oil over it and add the saffron mixed
into two tsp of milk. Cover with remaining rice, cover and cook on
very low heat for ten minutes. Serve accompanied with whipped,
lightly sweetened yogurt. The chicken could be substituted with 1/2
pound of mixed vegetables.
