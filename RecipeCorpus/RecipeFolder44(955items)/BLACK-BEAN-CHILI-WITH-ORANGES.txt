Title: BLACK BEAN CHILI WITH ORANGES
Categories: Main dish, Chili
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lg Onions, chopped
2    Cloves garlic, pressed or
-minced
1 tb Salad oil
2 qt Regular-strength chicken
-broth
1 lb Dried black beans, sorted
-for debris and rinsed
1 tb Coriander seed
1 ts Whole allspice
1 ts Dried oregano leaves
3/4 ts Crushed dried hot red
-chilies
6    Cardamom pods, hulls remove
-(1/4 tsp seed).
2 1/2 lb Oranges for zest, juice,
-slices
Combine in onions, garlic, and oil in a lidded 6 quart sauce pan,
over high heat.  Stir often until onions are tinged with brown, about
8 minutes. Add remaining ingredients, but not zest, juice, or slices,
to onions, etc., and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to
simmer. Cover and simmer until beans are tender to bite, about 1 1/2
to 2 hours.

While beans simmer, remove 2 teaspoons zest, squeeze 1/2 cup juice,
remove peel and white membrane from rest of fruit and slice thinly
crosswise, removing seeds. After the beans become tender, raise heat
to high, uncover, and boil until most of the liquid evaporates, about
10 ~ 15 minutes. (Reduce the heat and stir occasionally as mixture
thickens.) Remove beans from heat and stir in 1 tsp zest and the 1/2
C juice. Ladle beans into serving bowls. Place the sliced fruit
equally on top of the beans in each bowl.  Add to taste: sour cream,
fresh cilantro sprigs, salt. Garnish with the remaining 1 tsp zest.
