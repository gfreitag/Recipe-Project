Heat oven to 350~. Grease and flour baking pan, 9x9x2". Measure nuts
into blender; chop on low speed. Set nuts aside. In order listed,
measure remaining ingredients except chocolate pieces into blender.
Blend 30 seconds on high speed, stopping blender occasionally to
scrape sides with rubber spatula. (Batter may be slightly lumpy).
Pour batter into pan. Bake about 35 minutes or until wooden pick
inserted in center comes out clean. Immediately sprinkle chocolate
pieces over cake. Place baking sheet over pan so contained heat will
soften chocolate pieces. Spread softened chocolate evenly over cake;
sprinkle with reserved nuts. Serve warm.

nuts and chocolate pieces into large mixer bowl. Blend 1/2 minute on
low speed, scraping bowl constantly. Beat 3 minutes high speed,
