Title: BEST NUT LOAF
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Loaf
3 c  Sifted enriched flour
3/4 c  Sugar
3 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 ts Salt
1    Egg, beaten
1 1/2 c  Milk
2 tb Salad oil
3/4 c  California walnuts, broken
Stir the dry ingredients together. Combine egg, milk, and salad oil;
add to dry ingredients, mixing well. Stir in nuts. Turn into greased
9 1/2 X 5 X 3-inch loaf pan. Bake at 350F about an hour. Remove from
pan; cool.

NOTE: I usually put in 1 c nuts. Don't over mix because it won't
rise, and becomes a hard brick.

It's especially good with Cream cheese spread on it.

Recipe from Better Homes & Gardens approx. early 1960s.
