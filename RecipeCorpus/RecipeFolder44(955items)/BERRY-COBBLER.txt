You may use a mixture of any berries available to you ~- except
strawberries.  Blackberries or boysenberries are nice for the bulk; a
few raspberries add a delicious perfume. Measure 4 1/2 cups of mixed
berries and toss them with the sugar and flour. Use the larger amount
of flour if the berries are very juicy.  Let stand while you make the
dough. Mix the dry ingredients for the dough, leaving out the salt if
you are using salted butter.  Cut in the butter until the mixture
looks like coarse cornmeal. Add the cream and mix lightly, until the
dry ingredients are just moistened.  The dry ingredients for the
topping can be prepared ahead -- even several days ahead -- and kept
refrigerated. The cream can then be added when you are ready to bake
the cobbler. Put the berry mixture into a 1-1/2 quart gratin or
baking dish.  Make patties of the dough, 2 to 2-1/2 inches in
diameter and 1/2-inch thick. Arrange them over the top of the
berries.  Bake in a preheated 375 F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or
until the topping is brown and the berry juices bubble thickly around
it. Serve warm with cream to pour over it. People who don't
ordinarily like dessert will often eat this.
