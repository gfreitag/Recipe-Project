Title: BLACK BEANS & CORN THERMOS LUNCH
Categories: Digest, August
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Black beans
1/2 c  Canned corn
1/2 c  Cooked, brown rice
x  Salsa
A favorite one pot meal that you can take to work in a thermos is 1/2
c black beans (dehydrated or canned); 1/2 canned corn (rinsed) or
cooked frozen corn; 1/2 cooked brown rice; and enough salsa to blend
the mixture together.  This is a very satisfying and filling meal. I
certainly enjoyed my first five emails on this list.
