These are a traditional Mexican cookie and must be made with lard to
have the right consistency.  So, eat a lot of oat bran the next
day...don't forgo one of the best cookies you will ever, ever eat.
Position a rack in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat
the oven to 350F. In a mixer, whip the lard until it is light and
creamy. Beat in the sugar, sherry, and orange juice. Beat in the egg
yolk and then the flour. Roll the dough out between layers of waxed
paper to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Cut out cookies in whatever shapes
you wish, transferring them to ungreased baking sheets. Bake them 12
to 15 minutes, exchanging the position of the sheets on the racks
from top to bottom and from front to back at the halfway point, until
the cookies are crisp and lightly colored. For the coating, mix the
sugar, cinnamon, and cloves in a wide shallow dish (like a pie
plate).  Carefully dredge the cookies in the spiced sugar while they
are warm.  Cool completely on a rack.  Store at room temperature in
airtight tins.
