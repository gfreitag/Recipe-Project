Categories: Soups
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  Dried black beans
1 md Onion; finely diced
3 tb Butter or oil
1 sm Carrot
- peeled and finely diced

6 c  Chicken broth

THE NIGHT BEFORE, place beans in a bowl, cover with 3 inches of water
and soak at least 8 hours or up to 10. Or, for a quick-cook method,
place beans in hot water for 1 hour before continuing with the
recipe. Combine onion and oil in a 2-quart pot over medium heat on
top of the stove and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add
the carrot and celery and cook another 5 minutes. Add the drained
beans, stock, ham hock, thyme. Cover, increase heat to high and bring
to a boil. Decrease heat to low and cook, covered, for 1 1/2 hours.
Place beans and liquid in a food processor or blender and puree until
smooth. Pour the puree back into the pot and add lemon juice and
sherry. Place a dollop of sour cream in each soup bowl and sprinkle
with some chopped fresh dill. Pour the piping hot soup at the table.
