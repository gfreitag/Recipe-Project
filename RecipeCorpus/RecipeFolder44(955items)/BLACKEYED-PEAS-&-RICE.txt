Title: BLACKEYED PEAS & RICE
Categories: Rice, Vegetarian, Stews, Low-fat
Yield: 8 Servings
1 x  -Dried black-eyed peas
1/2    Onion
1 x  Lipton Rice 'n' Sauce Cajun
1 tb Pepper
1 x  Stew Meat
1 ts Creole or Cajun seasoning
1 x  Bell pepper
Cayenne pepper or hot sauce

Look thru peas for rocks and wash through 3 waters. Soak peas in water
overnight in fridge.  The next day, throw out water they soaked in;
some claim this keeps beans from giving you a problem, but stay on
this diet a couple weeks and you won't have a problem anyway. It goes
away. Wash stew meat and put stew meat and pre-soaked peas in big pot
on stove and bring to boil, with PLENTY of water. Add seasonings to
taste. If you use Cajun seasoning it contains salt; so don't add
extra salt!!!! Otherwise, add salt to taste.  When stew meat and peas
come to a boil, reduce to Medium and keep watching to add water so
they don't scorch. After about 40 minutes add packet of Rice and
Sauce, preferably Cajun flavor. Start watching the water really
carefully now, and add a pint from time to time. After about 20
minutes of rice cooking, add bell pepper, onion, and more seasonings
if you need.  (This dish is good hot and peppery) Everything should
be ready at the same time. When test bite shows all is ready, eat!
