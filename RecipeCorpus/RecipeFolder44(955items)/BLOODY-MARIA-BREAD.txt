3 c  Bread flour
1 1/4 c  V-8 Vegetable juice
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt

1 ts Rosemary; ground
1 ts Basil; ground

1/2 ts Oregano
2 tb Virgin olive oil

I'll have to admit that when I make this bread I usually use the V-8
mixture that I have in the refrigerator. I add a much larger quantity
of the herbs that are listed to a bottle of V-8 and let it set. It
makes a nice drink with or without vodka. If you drink it with vodka,
it's a "Bloody Mary," without vodka, it's a "Bloody Shame." The bread
tastes better if you mix the herbs in the V-8 at least 24 hours
before baking. Be that as it may - add all ingredients to the baking
container of your machine and bake on basic bread cycle. It's a
"speecy" bread and goes with well "speecy meata balls."
