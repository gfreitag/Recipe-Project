What you will need. Vegetable peeler ice cube tray tall glasses

1.. Prepare these bloody eyeballs the day before you plan to serve
them. With an adult's help, peel 12 radishes, leaving thin streaks of
red skin on them for blood vessels.

2... Using the tip of the vegetable peeler or small knife, carefully
scoop out a small hole in each radish. Stuff a green olive, pimento
side out, in each hole. Place 1 radish in each section of an empty
ice cube tray. ( You may need to pare your eyeballs down a bit to fit
the ice cube tray.)

3... Fill the tray with water and freeze overnight.

4... Pout tall glasses 3/4 full of tomato juice and add a pair of
eyeballs to each glass.  Cheers !! This bloods for you !
