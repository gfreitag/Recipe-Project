Title: HIGH-PROTIEN BLUEBERRY MUFFINS
Categories: Breads, Muffins
Yield: 12 Servings
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
1/3 c  Brown sugar, packed
1    Egg
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/3 c  Wheat germ
1/4 c  Dry milk
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 c  Milk
1 c  Fresh/frozen blueberries
1/4 c  Brown sugar, packed
1/3 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
Cream together butter and sugar.  Beat in the egg.

In another bowl, combine whole wheat flour, wheat germ, dry milk and
baking powder mixing well.

Add dry ingredients alternately with milk to the butter mixture. Stir
until combined, but do not overbeat. Fold in blueberries.

Fill greased muffin pans.  Sprinkle Crumb Topping over each muffin.

Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Let muffins cool a few minutes
before removing from pan.

CRUMB TOPPING:  Combine 1/4 cup packed, brown sugar with 1/3 cup whole
wheat flour and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Cut in 1/4 cup butter or
margarine.

TIPS:  Butter, especially sweet butter, gives the muffins a special
taste. If sweet butter is used, add 1/2 teaspoon salt to dry
ingredients.

NUTRITION NOTE:  The wheat germ "complements" the flour and almost
doubles the protien value.  The dry milk "supplements" the flour and
increases the protien value by 50%
