Dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Add the oil, honey, cinnamon

pastry flour and whole wheat flour to make a stiff dough. Beat well.

Spoon the dough into two 5- by 7-inch bread pans. Cover with a damp

almost doubled.

Bake in a 400-degree oven for 30 to 40 minutes.  Cool in the pan for
10 minutes.  Remove and cool completely on a wire rack. When cooled
thoroughly, wrap in aluminum foil and store for at least 3 days before
serving.

Bread may be made several weeks ahead and kept in an airtight
container in a cool place.
