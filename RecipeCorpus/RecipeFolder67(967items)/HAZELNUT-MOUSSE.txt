A classic hazelnut mousse makes a delightful dessert for special
occasions. This one is flavoured with some black coffee - two
sophisticated flavours in one dish.

Beat the egg yolks until they are pale, add the sugar and beat until
the mixture is thick. Beat in the melted butter and stir in the
coffee and the ground hazelnuts. Whisk the crme fraiche and fold
into the nut mixture gently but thoroughly. Chill for at least
2    hours before serving.
