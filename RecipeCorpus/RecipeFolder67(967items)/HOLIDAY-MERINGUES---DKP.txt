Beat egg whites (at room temperature) in a small bowl at high speed
of an electric mixer until foamy; add cream of tartar and vanilla,
beating until soft peaks form.

Spoon meringue mixture into 10 mounds on a baking sheet lined with
heavy brown paper.  Shape meringue mixture into circles, using the
back of a spoon to mound the sides at least 1/2 inch higher than the
centers.

Bake at 225 for 1 hour.  Turn oven off, and let meringues cool
completely before opening oven door. Transfer meringues to serving
plates.

Scoop sherbet into shells; top with Cranberry Sauce, and serve
immediately.

Di Note:  A nice, light dessert after stuffing yourself <G>.
