Title: HEALTHY LIVER SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Liver, chopped
2 tb Butter
4 sm Carrots, diced
1/2 c  Celery, diced
1 lg Onion, thinly sliced
2 c  Hot water
1 tb Sugar
1 c  Fresh or frozen spinach
20 oz Can Tomatoes
Salt and Pepper to taste

Stir cook the liver in butter.Add remaining ingredients.Stir well.
Cook covered (25 min in microwave).  This soup freezes and reheats
very well.

This will take some experimenting but I could make it at the same
time as a stir fry and freeze the soup in plastic ice cube trays
instead of freezing half the package of raw liver.

Have you tried it using a creamed soup?

I'm not all that fond of cooked tomatoes, but it looks like it might
be good using something like cream of Cheddar...

Also... were you using beef or chicken or what?

Also... how about some diced potatoes...?

OTOH...  Let's eliminate the butter and use bacon... Turns it into a
chowder...
