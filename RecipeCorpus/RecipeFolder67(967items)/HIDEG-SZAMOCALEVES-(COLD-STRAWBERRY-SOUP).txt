Just a faint memory up here what with our fading daylight but well
worth saving for next year.  This series includes recipes from
Europey, Turkey and one honest to goodness Ozzy recipe.

Cold fruit soups are popular in central Europe and this recipe for
strawberry soup from Hungary. Obviously it is not the sort of thing
one makes when strawberries are expensive, but at the peak of their
season it makes a good and unusual starter.

Hull 4 punnets [?] of strawberries into a large bowl (reserving about
6 to 10 strawberries, depending on their size, for decoration),
sprinkle generously with sugar and crush thoroughly with a fork.

Add 1 litre of liquid made up of the juice of half a lemon and a 50-
50 mix of red wine and water.  Taste and if necessary sweeten further
or add a little more lemon juice. Chill and decorate with sliced
reserved strawberries before serving, preferably in clear glass bowls.

Makes 3 servings.
