Title: HERMAN STARTER  #L
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
INGREDIENTS
*-+*
2 c  Flour
3 tb Sugar
1    Envelope Active Dry Yeast
1 ts Salt
2 c  Warm Water(105 to 115
-degrees)
***** HERMAN'S STARTER *****

DIRECTIONS *-+*

In large bowl mix flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Gradually stir in the
water; beat or whisk until smooth. Cover with towel; set in warm (80
to 85 degree)draft-free place-the kitchen or other warm room in
summer, or in cold weather on top of insulated furnace or radiator,
on a buffer such as a folded towel or pillow. Stir 2 or 3 times a day
for about 3 days or until starter is bubbly and produces a yeast
aroma. Transfer to a larger bowl, large jar or plastic container.
Cover partially(tilt lid or punch holes in plastic cover);
refrigerate. Makes about 1 1/2 to 2 cups starter, depending on
thickness. It can be creamy or as thick as dough because of room
conditions, the age of "Herman" and other variables.

THE FLAVOR OF THIS STARTER EVOLVES AS IT AGES-MILDLY SWEET WHEN
YOUNG, MORE LIKE SOURDOUGH WHEN OLDER.

Herman is replenished only after you use it. If that is going to be
longer than 14 days, then put it in the freezer until ready to use.
