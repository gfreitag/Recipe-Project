2    Egg yolks
1 3/4 c  Milk
1/2 c  Cooking oil or melted

In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and
malted-milk powder.

In a medium mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks. Beat in the milk and
cooking oil or shortening. Add to the flour mixture all at once,
stirring till blended but still slightly lumpy.

In a small mixer bowl, beat egg whites till stiff peaks form. Gently
fold into the egg-flour mixture, leaving a few fluffs of egg white.
Do not overmix.

Bake waffles in Belgian waffle-maker or regular waffle-maker
according to manufacturer's directions. (To keep waffles hot for
serving, place in a single layer on a wire rack on a baking sheet in
a warm oven.)

Prepare Fruit-Pecan Sauce.

Serve waffles topped with ice cream and warm Fruit-Pecan Sauce.

Fruit-Pecan Sauce: Peel bananas, cut in half lengthwise, then cut
crosswise into thirds. Brush with lemon juice. Halve the
strawberries. In a large skillet, heat brown sugar and butter or
margarine over medium heat till the mixture melts, stirring
occasionally.

Add the bananas and strawberries; cook, uncovered, till bananas are
heated through, turning once. Stir in rum or orange juice, then the
pecans.

Note: For a quick variation, sprinkle each waffle with 1 Tbsp chopped
nuts; crumbled, crisp-cooked bacon; or chopped granola before closing
iron.

Notes: Belgian waffles are a mainstay at Midwest brunches. Here's our
delicious version, topped with ice cream and a warm fruit and pecan
sauce.
