1/2 c  Honey ; or brown sugar
1/3 c  Warm water
2 tb Yeast
2 c  Milk
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  White flour; or unbleached
1 tb Ginger
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 c  White flour; or unbleached
1/4 c  Honey; or brown sugar 1/4 t
Stir well. Keep in refrigerator. Sprinkle ginger and 1 T. honey or
brown sugar over warm water. Sprinkle yeast over this and stir. Let
stand in warm place to double in size, about 10 minutes. Mix milk,
rest of honey or brown sugar, flours & yeast mixture in a glass
container, about the size of a gallon Pyrex jar. Stir, using only a
wooden spoon, since metal objects will retard Herman's growth. Leave
the cover on loosely or place a glass plate over the top of the
container so Herman can breathe. Herman doubles, even triples at time
of vigorous rising. Place Herman in a warm place overnight. Next day
refrigerate, loosely covered, and stir each day. This is very
important with Wheat'n'Honey Herman Starter as more gases form in the
container and are released during stirring. Formation of this gas may
cause the starter to appear darker on top before stirring each day,
but this is OK. On the 5th day measure out 1 c. Herman for baking and
another cup to give to a friend, if you wish, then feed the Herman
you have left, thusly: SEE ABOVE From day 5 on you may bake with
Herman any day you wish, always making sure you have one full cup
left for feeding. Feed Herman every five days. If you have a lot
left, feed him only 1 T. honey or brown sugar. If you have one cup or
a little more left, add the same ingredients as you did on the 5th
day. When you share a cup of Herman with friends they should feed
Herman the same way. From News & Observer, Raleigh, N.C. 10/17/90
