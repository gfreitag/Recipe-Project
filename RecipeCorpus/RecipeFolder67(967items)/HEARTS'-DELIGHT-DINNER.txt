Roasted Sirloin: Press rosemary into both sides of sirloin steak.
Roast on rack in a shallow roasting pan in a 350 F oven 50-60 minutes
or 16-20 minutes per pound. Remove roast when a meat thermometer
inserted in center reaches 135 F for medium-rare. Let roast stand 10
minutes before carving into thin slices. Serve with either
Cranberry-Jalapeno Salsa or Red Pepper Sauce recipes below.

Cranberry-Jalapeno Salsa: Blend cranberries, juice and sugar in food
processor for 30-45 seconds. Transfer to saute pan and add remaining
ingredients. Stir to mix. Let ingredients stand at least 30 minutes
for flavors to blend. Warm sauce over low heat before serving. Do not
boil. Salt to taste.

*NOTE: 7-oz. jar roasted red peppers may be used in place of 2 medium
freshly roasted red peppers.

Red Pepper Sauce: Blend peppers, vinegar and salt in blender using
pulse switch until coarsely chopped. Sauce may be served at room
temperature or heated. To roast peppers, broil 2" from heat, turning
frequently, until skin bubbles and is evenly charred. Transfer
peppers, to sealable plastic baggie, close and set aside until
peppers cool. Peel charred skin from peppers. Remove seed.

Greens with Walnut Vinaigrette: Combine vinegar and next 6
ingredients in a small bowl, stirring well. Stir in walnuts; pour
over field greens and toss gently.

Brown Rice:  Follow package directions for 8 servings of your favorite
brown rice, substituting beef broth for 1/2 the amount of liquid
requited. Add 1/4 cup green onions, thinly sliced. Salt & pepper to
taste.
