Title: HERBED GREY MULLET
Categories: Barry, Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Grey Mullet, cleaned and
-trimmed
bn Fresh Parsley (good size)
Sprig of celery leaves
2    Sprigs fresh thyme
2    Bay leaves
2    Lemons, sliced
1 tb Butter
Salt and pepper
Preheat the oven to gas mark 5, 375F, 190C. Wash the herbs and remove
the stalks from the parsley. Chop the parsley leaves coarsely and put
them on one side. Chop the parsley stalks, celery leaves and thyme
and mix with the bay leaves. Stuff the cavity of the fish with this
mixture. Oil a large sheet of kitchen foil and put a line of lemon
slices into the cavity and arrange the rest of the lemon long the top
of the fish. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle generously with
the parsley leaves and wrap the fish loosely in the foil, but make
sure the edges of the foil are tightly sealed. Put it in the oven and
bake for 45 minutes.

To serve, unwrap the foil carefully - there will be a wonderfully
herby, lemony, cloud of steam - and remove as much of the liquid that
has formed around the fish as possible. You can serve that as a sauce
on its own or boil it up briefly with either a knob of butter or a
couple of tablespoons of double cream to make it rich and special.

Lay the fish on a serving dish and serve with new potatoes.
