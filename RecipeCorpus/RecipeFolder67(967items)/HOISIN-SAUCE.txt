*The original without the variations stolen by Matt Giwer from AP
Recipes credited to Dee Wang who advised peanut butter. *EXPERIMENT!
Now you have control of the taste. Lighter for chicken and pork,
stronger for beef and game.  Sweeter for Dim Sum. *The commercial
recipe is presumably the black bean paste.
I presume they are the same as Mexican/Spanish black beans.
*Different types of soy, molasses, some of the oil being hot pepper
oil, other styles of pepper sauce.  All kinds of variations. However,
with light soy and honey, the taste of peanut dominates. *Simply mix
together. At first it does not appear like it will mix but   keep at
it just a bit longer and you have Hoisin.  Letting it rest does not
appear to improve the taste noticeably.
