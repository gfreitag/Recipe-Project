from Sue Woodward in the Delphi February 1995 cookbook swap. Henry
Winkler contributed this recipe when he was in Tampa directing the
movie, "Cop and a Half."

Treasure Tip:  For an impressive presentation, serve this salad in
flour tortilla shells.  Brush both sides of 12- or 16-inch flour
tortillas with melted butter. Press them into small ovenproof bowls;
toast 5 to 8 minutes in a 375~ oven.  Unmold the tortillas; place
them directly on the oven rack until they are crisp and toasted, 1 to
2 minutes.
