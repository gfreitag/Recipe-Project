Much better than the store bought diet breads which use "sawdust
fiber" as filler.  This is a tasty, dense loaf. Makes good
sandwiches. The recipe is based on a formula devised for superior
nutrition in bread by faculty at Cornell University.  Wheat germ, soy
flour and nonfat dry milk are added to each cup of flour in the
Cornell Formula, this recipe makes it easier.
