MOUTHWATERING SELECTIONS FROM "THE GREAT AMERICAN CHOCOLATE COMPANY"

Americans have enjoyed Hershey's chocolate since 1894 when Hershey's
baking chocolate and cocoa were introduced and Hershey Chocolate
Company, today known as Hershey Foods Corporation, was established.

As The Great American Chocolate Company celebrates its 100th
anniversary, America's love affair with chocolate continues with such
favorite treats as Hershey's milk chocolate bars, Hershey's Kisses
chocolate, Hershey's syrup, Hershey's Cookies 'n' Mint chocolate bars
and the recently introduced Hershey's Hugs chocolates.

In celebration of the centennial, the Hershey Kitchens have created
this special anniversary booklet for certified chocolate lovers who
have helped make the Hershey's name virtually synonymous with
chocolate.

This booklet is filled with some of the classic recipes our mothers
and grandmothers prepared, new recipes that incorporate some of
Hershey's most recent products, and even some lighter creations with
Hershey's cocoa, which is naturally low in fat. We hope you will take
time to try some in your kitchen.

From our family to yours, here's to another 100 years of sweet
success!
