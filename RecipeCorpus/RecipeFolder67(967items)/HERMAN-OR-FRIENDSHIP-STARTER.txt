Title: HERMAN OR FRIENDSHIP STARTER
Categories: Sourdough
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Warm water
2    Envelopes active dry yeast
2 c  Milk
2 c  Flour
Sprinkle one tablespoon sugar over warm water. Sprinkle yeast over
this and let stand in warm place until doubled in size, about 10
minutes. Mix milk, remaining sugar, flour and yeast mixture. Place in
plastic or glass containter about the size of a 5-quar ice cream
bucket. Stir, using only a wooden sppon or paddle, as metal retards
growth. Cover loosely and let stand in a warm place overnight. The
next day, refrigerate. Stir each day with a wooden spoon to retard
spoilage. On the fifth day, measure out one cup to bake with. Measure
out one cup for gift. Feed remaining starter one cup flour, one cup
milk and one-half cup sugar. Stir well. Refrigerate and stir daily.
On the 10th day, measure out one cup, if desired, to give to a
friend. You should have enough left over to use in a recipe, plus
extra to feed as before and refrigerate. Thereafter, use the starter
almost daily or as desired, feeding every five days. From: Pat
