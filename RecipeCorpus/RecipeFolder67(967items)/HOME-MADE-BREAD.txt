Title: HOME MADE BREAD
Categories: Breads, Low fat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 lb Strong [bread] flour, either
White or wholemeal
[wholewheat]
As preferred
1/2 pk Instant dried yeast
1 ts Sugar
lg Pinch salt
Warm water to mix
Mix flour, yeast, salt and sugar, then add enough water to make a
fairly firm dough.  Knead vigorously until dough is smooth and
elastic - you can do this in a food processor, but it is very
therapeutic to do it by hand! Place in a clean bowl, cover, and leave
in a warm place for about an hour, or until doubled in size. Knead
again, then place on a greased, floured oven-proof plate.  Cover, if
possible with an oven- proof bowl, and leave for ten-fifteen minutes.

Bake in a hot oven (mark 7, 200 C, 425 F) for about 40 minutes, or
until it sounds hollow when tapped underneath. This doesn't keep well
as it has no fat, but that is seldom a problem!
