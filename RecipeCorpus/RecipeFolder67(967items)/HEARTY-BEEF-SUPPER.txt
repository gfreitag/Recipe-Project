Title: HEARTY BEEF SUPPER
Categories: Cheese, Hamburger, Main dish, Meats, Vegetables
Yield: 7 Servings
2 lb Lean Ground Beef
1 c  Onion; Chopped, 1 Lg
1 c  Cracked Wheat; Uncooked
2 c  Tomato; Fresh, Chopped, 2 Md
2 c  Water
3 tb Parsley; Snipped
2 ts Beef Bouillon; Instant
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Oregano Leaves
1/4 ts Minced Garlic; Instant
1/4 ts Pepper
1/2 c  Parmesan Cheese; Grated
Cook and stir the meat and onion in a large skillet until the meat is
brown.  Drain off the excess fat. Stir in the remaining ingredients
except the grated Parmesan Cheese. Heat to boiling then reduce the
heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until the wheat is
tender, about 30 minutes.  (A small amount of water can be added if
necessary.) Stir in the cheese and garnish with additional snipped
parsley and/or Parmesan Cheese. NOTE: The nutlike texture of cracked
wheat reminds one of brown rice, in fact, it is cooked and used in
the same way.
