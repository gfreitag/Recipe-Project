Title: HOLIDAY CIDER
Categories: Beverages, Holidays, Alcohol, Champagne
Yield: 1 Servings
5 ga Apple Juice
-(Gravenstein/Jonathan
-blend)
6 c  Maple Syrup
2 1/3 tb Whole Cloves
1/2 tb Whole nutmeg; grated
10 4-inch cinnamon sticks
3    Lemons (juice and zest)
2    Inches ginger root; peeled
-and grated
1 pk Red Star Champagne Yeast
Simmer 3/4 gallon apple juice, spices and ginger (in spice bags),
syrup, and lemon juice and zest for 45 mins. Add simmered mix to
4--1/4 gallon. Put cider in carboy. Pitch yeast and top off with more
apple juice. Ferment for 34 days. Rack to secondary and top off with
more apple juice. Prime with 3/4 cup corn sugar and bottle. Age for
30 days and consume. Good sparkle, mildly yeasty (not careful enough
with my secondary rack- ing), complex flavor, some spice in the nose,
too much alcohol (my calcs say that the alcohol content is about 15%,
but it tastes much stronger). In general, I'm pretty pleased; almost
everybody who's tried it has been pleased as well. Original Gravity:
1.100 Final Gravity: 0.998 Primary Ferment: 34 days Secondary
Ferment: 22 days
