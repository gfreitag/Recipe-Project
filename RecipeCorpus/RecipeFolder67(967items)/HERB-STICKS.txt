"The herb flavors become intense in these simple crackers. Try any of
your favorite herbs and spices, alone or in combinations. Dill works
well, as does a mix of four parts basil to one part oregano. These
crackers go well with dips and are expecially good crumbled into
soups and salads.

15 to 20 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.
325~F.

Combine the flour, herbs, salt, and pepper in a large bowl or in the
food processor. Add the oil and blend until the mixture resembles
coarse meal. Slowly blend in enough of the water to form a dough that
will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out very thin,
1/8    inch maximum.

With a sharp knife, cut the dough into rectangles 1 inch by 5 inches
and place them on an ungreased baking sheet.

Prick each cracker in 3 places with a fork, pressing all the way
through the dough. Brush the tops with the egg mixture. Bake for 10
minutes. Turn the crackers over, brush them with the egg mixture, and
continue baking for another 5 to 10 mintues. Cool on a rack. These
crackers will crispen as they cool. If some of them are still not
crisp after cooling, put them back in the oven for a few minutes and
let them cool again. Yield: 60-70.
