Title: HERBED QUINOA
Categories: Seasonings, Grains, Side dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Quinoa; thoroughly rinsed
2 c  ;Water
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 md Garlic clove; peel and mince
Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 c  Fresh basil, packed* or
1/4 c  Fresh tarragon plus
2 tb Fresh thyme
*If the listed herbs are unavailable, substitute an equal amount of
parsley, or 1 ts. dried thyme, basil or oregano.

Put quinoa, water and salt in a medium-size saucepan, cover, and
bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, cover
partially so the steam can escape, and cook at a slow boil until
grains have doubled in size, become translucent, and are cracked open
so that the spiral germ of the grain is visible, about 12 minutes. If
necessary, continue cooking, uncovered, until all the liquid has been
absorbed or has evaporated, which may take 1 more minute.

While quinoa is cooking, combine olive oil, garlic and a generous
amount of pepper in a warmed medium-size bowl. Just before the quinoa
is cooked, coarsely but neatly chop basil leaves and mix them into
the olive oil mixture.  When quinoa is ready, add it to the olive
oil, tossing until it is thoroughly combined. Check seasonings and
serve immediately.

Nice accompaniment to steamed fish or to roasted meats or poultry. Or
serve as a main course along with a variety of vegetables and salads.
