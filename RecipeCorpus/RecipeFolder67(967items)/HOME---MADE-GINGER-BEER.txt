This home-brew remains a favourite party drink in a Welsh household
for both adults and children.  You will need eight pint bottles or
four quart bottles. They should be of a strong material and have firm
caps with metal springs to imprison the effervescent liquid ~ it's
more explosive than champagne.  Makes 1 gallon. Roughly crush the
ginger root. Wash and slice the lemons into thick rings. Put the
ginger, lemon, cream of tartar and sugar in a large bowl. Pour the
boiling water over. Stir and leave to cool to blood temperature. Stir
in the yeast. Leave to ferment for 24 hours. Skim off the yeast.
Strain and bottle the liquid. Leave for three days before broaching
it.
