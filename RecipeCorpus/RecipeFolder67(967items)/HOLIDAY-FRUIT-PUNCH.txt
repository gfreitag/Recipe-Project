Categories: Beverages
Yield: 24 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------ICE RING-------------------------------
5 c  Orange juice
5    Limes
Marachino cherries
MMMMM---------------------------PUNCH--------------------------------
4 c  Pineapple juice, chilled
3 c  Grapefruit juice, chilled
1 1/2 c  Orange juice, chilled
1/2 c  Lime juice
3/4 c  Sugar
3 c  Ginger ale, chilled
To prepare ice ring, pour 2 1/2 cups of the orange juice into 6-cup
ring mold; freeze until firm.

To make lime rose, use a very sharp knife and starting at one end of
lime, cut a continuous 1-inch wide strip in spiral fashion, taperin
to the opposite end to remove. Curl the strip, peel side out, into a
rose shape.

Pour 1 1/4 cups orange juice over frozen juice in ring. Arrange lime
roses in juice, right side up; frreeze until firm. Garnish with
cherries. Pour remaining 1 1/4 cups orange juice into mold to
partially cover cherries; freeze until firm.

* I'm sure if you don't wish to go through the trouble you can spread
the lime slices and cherries in liquid and it would just as nice.

To prepare punch, combine juices and sugar in large punch bowl; blend
well. Just before serving, gently pour in ginger ale; stir gently.
Unmold ice ring and float, fruit side up in punch bowl.
