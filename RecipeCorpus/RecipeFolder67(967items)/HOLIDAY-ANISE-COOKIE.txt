Categories: Biscuits
Yield: 35 Servings
2 c  Flour
1 tb Anise extract
1/2 tb Baking Powder
1/8 tb Salt
1    Large lemon
2/3 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Vegetable shortening
5 3/16 tb Unsalted butter
1    Egg yolk
1 ts Vanilla extract

1 tb Sugar
1 ts Ground cinnamon
Thoroughly stir together flour, anise, baking powder, and slat and set
aside.  Using a small sharp knife peel a thin layer of zest (without
white membrane) from the entire lemon. Combine lemon zest and sugar
in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Process until zest is
very finely minced.  Add shortening and butter to the processor and
process for one minute.  Add egg yolk and vanilla and process 20
seconds longer. Add dry ingredients and continue processing just
until they are blended.

Divide dough in half and place each portion between large sheets of
waxed paper and roll out to 1/8 inch thick. Check the underside of
the dough to check for any creases. Slide dough onto a large tray or
baking sheet and refrigerate for 15 minutes, or until the dough is
chilled and slightly firm.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Lightly grease several baking sheets.

Work one half of the dough at at time.  Turn the dough over and peel
the sheet of wax paper off of the dough and replace the paper
loosely. Then turn the dough right side up. Peel off and discard the
top sheet of paper. Using assorted 2 1/4 to 3" cookie cutters cut out
cookies.

Place in the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes or until just brown ant
the edges.  Remove from the oven and let stand for 3 minutes.
Transfer to wire racks and let stand until cooled completely.
Sprinkle cookies with the decoration mixture.

Makes 35 to 40 cookies.
