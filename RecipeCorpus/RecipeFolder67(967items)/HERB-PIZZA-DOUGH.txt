Categories: Breads, Ethnic
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 ts Sugar
7/8 c  Warm water,
-@110 degrees
1/4 c  Chopped herbs,
-optional *
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Garlic olive oil,
-more as needed  **
Oil and cornmeal for pan
Stir together the yeast, sugar and warm water.  Let stand until foamy,
about 10 minutes.

In the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade,
chop the herbs.  Turn off machine.  Add flour and salt. Turn the
machine on and off a couple of times. While the machine is running,
add yeast. Process until the dough forms a ball at the side of the
bowl. Add garlic, olive oil and process for 30 to
40    seconds more.

Transfer dough to a bowl that has been oiled with olive oil. Turn the
dough until the entire surface has been coated with the oil. Cover
bowl with a damp towel and allow to rise in a warm draft free place
for 1 hour or until doubled.

Roll out on a lightly floured surface and if dough is too elastic, try
tossing it from hand to hand to flatten it out. Lightly grease the
pizza pan with a little oil and sprinkle with cornmeal. Place the
dough on the pizza pan and trim the edges.  Bake for 10 minutes @425
degrees. Remove from oven, lightly brush the crust with a little more
oil and proceed with recipe.

Makes enough dough for one 12" crust.

* Try basil, thyme, Italian flat leaf parsley, oregano, rosemary,
cilantro.
