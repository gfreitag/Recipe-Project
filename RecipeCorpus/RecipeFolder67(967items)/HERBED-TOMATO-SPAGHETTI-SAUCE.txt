Categories: Seasonings, Italian, Sauces
Yield: 1 Batch
2 tb Olive oil
1 md Red onion; chopped

28 oz Canned tomatoes
1 ts Aniseed; crushed
1    Bay leaf; broken
1/4 c  Dry red wine
1/4 c  Fresh oregano; chopped
1/4 c  Fresh basil; chopped
1/4 c  Italian parsley; chopped
2 tb Lemon balm; chopped
Saute onion, bell pepper, garlic and carrots in olive oil in a 4-qt.
saucepan until vegetables are tender (about 10 minutes). Add
mushrooms and continue cooking 2 or 3 minutes more.

Add tomatoes, bay leaf, aniseed and wine.  Simmer, uncovered, stirring
occasionally, until sauce thickens (about 1 to 1 1/2 hours).

Add oregano, basil, parsley and lemon balm; stir and simmer 15 to 20
minutes longer to let flavors mingle.

Cathy's note:  The recipe says nothing about removing the bay leaf
afterward, but this is standard practice so that any sharp edges on
it do not cause discomfort or physical damage to people.

The editors wrote:  "Selecting a basic herb-tomato sauce from the
many, many dozens that were submitted was [a]...chore. This one edged
out many other...entries for its simplicity, fresh approach, and the
short cooking time after the leafy herbs were added. While many
excellent cooks take the 'less is more' approach and add only
fractions of teaspoons of herbs, we liked the more assertive style
here and the surprising and intriguing addition of lemon balm (which
cooks out to a mellow hint of not-quite-lemon). This sauce depends on
a greater-than-usual amount of chopped carrot to cut the acidity of
fresh tomatoes."
