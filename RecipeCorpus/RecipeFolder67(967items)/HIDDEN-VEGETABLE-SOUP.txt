Title: HIDDEN VEGETABLE SOUP
Categories: Digest, Sept.
Yield: 5 Servings
1 sm Onion, chopped
2 sm Carrots, chopped
2    Celery stalks, chopped
1    Green or red pepper,
Chopped
1/2    Head green cabbage chopped
1    Or more cloves garlic
28 oz Can chopped or crushed
Tomatoes
2 c  Tomato or tomato-vegetable
Juice (more or less)
1 c  Salsa
1 c  Raw brown rice, mostly
Cooked (you can use
Leftover)
x  Herbs and pepper to taste--I
Usually use oregano and
Basil
x  Supermarket grade Balsamic
Vinegar
Puree the onion, carrots, celery, green pepper, cabbage, and garlic
(not all at once!) in a blender, using as much tomato juice as
necessary to aid the process. Combine with tomatoes, salsa and herbs,
and cook about 15 or 20 minutes.  If the rice is partially cooked,
add it with everything else; if fully cooked, add near the end of
cooking. If the soup is too thick for your taste, add tomato juice or
water. Just before serving, stir in a little balsamic vinegar.

I serve this as a main dish, along with bread. Probably makes about 5
or 6 servings.
