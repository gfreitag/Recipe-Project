Title: HOME STYLE JERKY #1
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Batch
1 lb Beef; cut in strips
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/4 ts Hickory salt
1/2 ts Onion salt
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Black pepper
1 ds Hot sauce
Combine all the ingredients and marinate in the fridge for at least 8
hours, mixing occasionally. Then, skewer the marinated strips on
bamboo skewers (or toothpicks) and hand the strips in the oven with a
pan below to catch the drippings. Set the oven on its lowest setting
(100-150 F) and use something to keep the door ajar. The jerky should
be dry after 8-10 hours. Submitted By SAM WARING
