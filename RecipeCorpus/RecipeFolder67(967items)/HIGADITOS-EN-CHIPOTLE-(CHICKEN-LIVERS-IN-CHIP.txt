Categories: Mexico, Poultry, Sauce/gravy
Yield: 4 Servings
Jim Vorheis
1/2 lb (about 1 large) tomatoes,
-broiled
2    Garlic cloves, peeled and
-roughly chopped
2    Canned chipotles en
-escabeche or en vinagre
3/4 lb Chicken livers
3 tb Melted chicken fat or
-safflower oil
1/2 md Onion, thinly sliced
Sea salt to taste
Put the unpeeled tomatoes, garlic, and chilies into a blender jar and
blend until almost smooth; there should be a little texture to the
sauce. Set aside.

Trim the livers of any connective tissue and any greenish spots from
the bile duct; cut each one into six parts. Heat the fat in a frying
pan, add the liver pieces and onion, sprinkle lightly with salt, and
fry, tossing them almost constantly - a stir-fry if you will- for
about 3 minutes over high heat.  Add the blended ingredients and,
still over high heat, cook for about 5 minutes or until the sauce has
reduced and seasoned. Adjust seasoning.
