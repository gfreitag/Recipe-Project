This recipe was one of Henry Ford's favorite snacks. The recipe was
found in Cooking For Henry, a cookbook by Henry Ford's personal party
chef, Jan Willemse. In 1934, Mr. Ford requested Willemse experiment
in cooking with soybeans, and the cookbook has an entire chapter
dedicated to soybean recipes.

Ford was a strong supporter of soybeans and saw the possibility for
the use of soybeans in food, milk, ice cream, paint, plastics, and
many other things before 1930. In Ford's fast-growing automobile
industry, and since, the soybean played a large part in the
manufacturing of commercial products.
