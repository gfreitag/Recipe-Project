Title: HOME-SMOKED CHIPOTLES ADOBADO
Categories: Sauces, Rubs
Yield: 100 Servings
Chunks or logs of fragrant
Hardwood,
Preferably a combination of
Oak & mesquite
1 1/4 lb Red-ripe jalapeno chiles,
With stems
1/2 c  Dried Red New Mexico Chile
Puree
OR -
Commercial chile paste, such
As Santa Cruz
1/3 c  Water
2 tb Tomato paste
2 tb Cider vinegar
1 tb Packed dark brown sugar
1    Clove fresh garlic
-peeled and crushed
1/4 ts Salt
Prepare a smoker according to the manufacturer's directions, using
the wood chunks and achieving a steady temperature of 275 to 300
degrees F. Place the chiles directly on the smoker rack (or use a
shallow disposable foil pan) at the cooler end of the smoking chamber
or on the upper rack if your smoker has one. Lower the cover and
smoke the chiles for 2 1/2 hours, or until they are soft, brown, and
slightly shriveled.

Remove the chipotles from the smoker. In a medium nonreactive
saucepan, combine them with the chile puree, water, tomato paste,
vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, and salt. Set over medium heat and
bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring once or twice, until the sauce is
very thick, about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature.

Transfer the chipotles to a covered storage container and refrigerate
for at least 24 hours before using. They can be refrigerated for up
to 2 weeks or frozen for up to 2 months.

UNSAUCED DRIED CHIPOTLES:  After removing the chiles from the smoker,
place them on a rack and leave them, loosely covered, at room
temperature, until crisp, light, and dry, 1 to 2 weeks, depending on
the humidity. Store airtight at room temperature.
