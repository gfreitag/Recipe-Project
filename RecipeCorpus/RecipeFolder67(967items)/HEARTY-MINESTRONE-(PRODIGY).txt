Title: HEARTY MINESTRONE (PRODIGY)
Categories: Soups, Italian, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 lb Dried beans
Salt
1    Celery stalk
1/4 lb Savoy cabbage
2 sm Boiling potatoes
1/4 c  Drained canned plum tomatoes
2 1/2 tb Chopped onion
2    Basil leaves
1/4 ts Dried thyme
2 tb Olive oil
Freshly ground black pepper
3 oz Imported Italian pasta
THE NIGHT BEFORE, pick over the beans, rinse them, and let them soak
in a large bowl of cold water. Next day, drain the beans, put them
into a large pot and cover with 4 cups water. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt,
bring to the boil and simmer, covered for 1-to-1 1/2 hours, until the
beans are nearly tender. Wash and cut into bite-size pieces the
celery, cabbage and potato. Roughly chop the tomatoes. Chop the
onion, basil, and thyme together. Heat the olive oil in a saute pan
and soften the onion mixture in it for 5 minutes. Add the celery,
cabbage, potato, tomato, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and several grindings of
black pepper. Toss everything to coat it with the oil, then add 1/3
cup warm water. Cover and cook gently 20 minutes, until the
vegetables are almost tender. When the beans are ready, scoop out
about a quarter of them and puree them through a food mill back into
the pot. Add the vegetables from the saute pan and all their juices.
Bring the soup to a boil and stir in the pasta. Cook until the pasta
is done, 10 to 12 minutes. Taste for seasoning.
