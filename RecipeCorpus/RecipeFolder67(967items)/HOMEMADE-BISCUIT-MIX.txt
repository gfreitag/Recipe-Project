Yield: 10 Servings
8 c  Flour
1/4 c  Baking powder

TO MAKE BISCUITS:

Add 1/2 cup milk to 2 cups Homemade Biscuit Mix and toss until
combined. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently for
about 20 seconds. Pat or roll to 1/2 inch thickness and cut with a
medium-sized (2 inch) biscuit cutter.  Bake in a preheated 450 F oven
for 12-15 minutes, until golden.  Serve hot. Makes 10-12 biscuits.
