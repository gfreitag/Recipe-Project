* Dave Chasen, Chasen's, Beverly Hills. Season steak with pepper.
Wrap fat around sides of steak, covering them completely but leaving
top and bottom exposed. Tie fat to steak with string near top and
bottom. Fat must be securely anchored to steak. Combine salt and
water to make paste. Mound about 3/4 of mixture over top of steak,
covering meat completely. Place steak under broiler and broil 8 to 10
minutes, depending on size of steak. Carefully remove salt crust,
keeping it in one piece. Turn steak over and place salt crust on
other side. If necessary, patch crust with remaining salt mixture.
Broil steak another 8 to 10 minutes. Remove steak from broiler and
discard crust and fat. Slice meat, cutting slightly on diagonal. Heat
butter in chafing dish or large skillet until foaming and lightly
browned. Place a few slices of meat at a time in butter and cook to
desired degree of doneness. (Allow about 1 minute on each side for
rare meat.) Place each slice of meat on slice of toast and spoon some
of the hot butter over.
