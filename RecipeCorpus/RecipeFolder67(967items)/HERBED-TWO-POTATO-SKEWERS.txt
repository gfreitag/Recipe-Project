Title: HERBED TWO-POTATO SKEWERS
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 6 Servings
4    Boiling potatoes
-(about 1 pound)
2 sm Sweet potatoes or yams
-(about 1 1/2 pound)
1/2 c  Olive oil
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1 tb Chopped fresh tarragon
-OR- thyme (1 tsp. dried)
1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/2 ts Salt
Prepare a fire in the grill. Position an oiled grill rack 4 inches
above the fire. Steam all the potatoes on a rack over boiling water
until they are barely tender when pierced, 15-20 minutes. Remove to a
large bowl and cover with cold water. Let stand for about 2 minutes,
then drain and pat dry. Cut the potatoes into 1 1/2 inch chunks and
thread them onto skewers. In a small bowl whisk together the oil,
parsley, tarragon, red pepper flakes, pepper, and salt; set aside.
Arrange the skewers on the grill rack. Grill, turning frequently and
brushing occasionally with the oil-herb mixture until the potato
skins are well browned, about
10    minutes.
