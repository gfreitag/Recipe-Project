Hershey's Chocolate Syrup

I  don't have the exact recipe, but this is what I make. I call it
after years of experimenting, as I am a fan of chocolate milk. The
proportions can vary though, if you use a different brand of cocoa,
so... Then again, some people like their syrup sweeter, however, I
like mine to taste like cocoa.

Chocolate Syrup

7/8 cup cocoa 8/8 cup sugar (ie. 1 cup) 9/8 cup water (1 and 1/8
cups) 1 t salt 1 t vanilla

Combine  first  four ingredients, and bring slowly to a boil while
stirring,  or nuke at 30%, stirring occasionally. After it boils, let
cool, and add vanilla. Store in fridge.
