pour onto prepared sheet, spreading thinly. Cool completely.
Pulverize in processor or blender.

For semifreddo: Beat cream in large chilled bowl until beginning to
thicken. Add liqueur and beat just until peaks form. Beat yolks with
10 tablespoons sugar in another large bowl until pale yellow and
slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted. Gently fold
in whipped cream and 1/3 cup praline. Spoon into serving glasses.
Freeze at least 2 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)

Beat egg white to blend. Dip grapes in egg white, then sugar, coating
well. Let dry 30 minutes.

If semifreddo is frozen solid, let soften in refrigerator 30 minutes
before serving. Garnish with grapes and mint.
