Title: HEALTHY WAFFLES
Categories: Digest, Sept.
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Rolled oats (can be toasted
First by putting thin layer
In pan
And baking at 350 degrees
For 15-20 minutes, or until
Lightly toasted)
1 pk RapidRise yeast
1 tb Sugar
3 tb Oat bran
2 tb Nonfat dry milk powder
1/2 c  Cornmeal
3/4 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 ts Baking soda
3 tb Wheat germ
Mix above ingredients in a large bowl. Heat ingredients below until
very warm (125-130 degrees) and stir into the dry mixture.

3/4 cup skim milk 2 egg whites 1/4 cup dark molasses

Let the batter sit for about 20 minutes, or overnight in the
refrigerator. You may want to add more milk or water to get them to
the consistency you like, depending on whether you're going to turn
them into waffles or pancakes.  I have varied the dry ingredients
radically, depending on what I have around the house. When I don't
have molasses, I increase the amount of honey and other liquids. No
matter what I do to this recipe, it always seems to turn out great.

I estimate the fat grams per 7" x 7" waffle to be <3 grams, which can
vary depending on the grains you use.

Adapted from a recipe for Healthy Pancakes from Morning Food from Cafe
Baujolais by Margaret S. Fox and John Bear (1990, Ten Speed Press) .
