"Why use 'Stove Top' when you can make your own?
Slice bread into 1/2" cubes (an electric knife works great!) Spread
evenly in large shallow baking pan and toast in 300 oven for 40 to 45
minutes until golden. In a large bowl, combine all, drizzling oil
over all, stirring to coat all cubes with oil. Makes about 10 cups.
