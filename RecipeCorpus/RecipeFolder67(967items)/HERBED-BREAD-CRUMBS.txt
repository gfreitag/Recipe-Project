Title: HERBED BREAD CRUMBS
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
4 sl Bread, whole wheat, stale
1 ts Basil
1/2 ts Thyme
1    Garlic clove; minced
Put all the ingredients into a food processor fitted with the metal
blade, and process until the bread is chopped into crumbs.

If your recipe calls for toasted bread crumbs, preheat the oven to
350 degrees. Spread the bread crumbs evenly on a baking sheet. Bake
for 3 to 5 minutes, stir the crumbs, and bake until light brown and
crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.

Makes about 2 cups.

These can be made ahead and stored in a plastic bag in the freezer.
