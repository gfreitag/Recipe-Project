"My favorite herb vinegar is rosemary made with a rich red wine
vinegar. It is the only one I use regularly, preferring to add other
herbs fresh to specific dishes.  You should experiment until you find
your favorite combinations."

Crush the fresh herbs, place them in a glass jar or crock, and cover
with the vinegar.  Let the mixture steep in a cool pantry for up to 1
month, tasting to determine when your vinegar is sufficiently
flavored. Strain through cheesecloth or a coffee filter.  Bottle, add
a fresh sprig of the herb, and close with a cork.  Store in a cool,
dark cupboard.

Suggested Combinations:

Rosemary with red wine vinegar Chives with white wine vinegar Sage

Savory with white wine vinegar Majoram with red wine vinegar Tarragon
