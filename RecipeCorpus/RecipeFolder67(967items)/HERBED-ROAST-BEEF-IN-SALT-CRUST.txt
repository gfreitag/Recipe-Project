Title: HERBED ROAST BEEF IN SALT CRUST
Categories: Dinner, Entree
1/3 c  Olive Oil
Yield: 8 Servings
1/4 c  Onion -- Grated
1 ts Garlic Salt
1 ts Basil -- Dried
1/2 ts Marjoram -- Dried
1/2 ts Thyme -- Dried
1/4 ts Pepper
4 lb to 6 Lb Roast Beef-See Note
3 Lb Kosher Salt -- See Note
1 1/4 c  Water

Combine oil, onion, garlic salt, basil, marjoram, thyme and pepper in
heavy plastic bag.  Mix well.
Add roast; coat well with marinade. Marinate in refrigerator 2 hours
or overnight.

Line roasting pan with aluminum foil.  Combine coarse kosher salt and
water to form a thick paste.  Pat 1 cup paste into a 1/2-inch thick
rectangle in pan. Pat roast dry with paper towels. Insert meat
thermometer. Place roast on salt layer.  Pack remaining salt paste
around meat to seal well.

Place roast in a 425-degree oven and roast 16 - 18 minutes per pound
for rare (140 degrees), 20 - 22 minutes per pound for medium (160
degrees), or 25 - 30 minutes per pound for well done (170 degrees).

Remove roast when thermometer registers 5 degrees below desired
doneness. Let roast stand 5 - 10 minutes in salt crust before carving.

If using an instant read thermometer (kind that isn't inserted before
roasting) check the estimated cooking time. Take roast out of the
oven 10 - 15 minutes before it should be done. You may have to poke a
hole in the salt crust first before inserting thermometer. Continue
roasting, if needed, and test temperature again in 5 minutes. To
remove roast from salt, you may need to use a hammer.  After removing
crust, use a stiff pastry or vegetable brush to whisk away any
remaining salt crystals.
