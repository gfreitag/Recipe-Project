To prepare leeks, cut off root end and tough green tops about 3-4
inches above white part of leek.  Cut in half lengthwise and rinse
under running water to remove sand. Cut into 1/2-inch slices. In a
large saucepan, melt butter.  Add leeks, potatoes, carrots and
onions. Cook slowly until soft, about 8-10 minutes, stirring often.
Add broth. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until
potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes. Add the milk gradually and
heat gently but do not boil. Stir in parsley, salt and pepper to
taste. "Military Lifestyles Four Seasons Recipes" * 1993 *
