Title: HERMAN PLANTATION GINGER CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Canned Sliced Pear Sauce*
1 pk Gingerbread Mix
1/2 c  Herman
1/2 c  Water
1/4 c  Pear Juice
*We weren't quite sure what sliced pear sauce would be, so we just
used sliced pears instead. It still tasted good.

Drain pears. Reserve syrup. Butter an 8" x 8" x 2" baking pan
generously. Arrange pear slices in circle around pan bottom and pour
1/4 C. pear juice over the pear sections.

Empty mix into bowl and add Herman, water and juice and beat
vigorously with form or spoon till well-blended.

Spoon batter over pear sections, carefully, and bake 35 to 40 mins. or
until done at 350 deg.

Do not overbake! Cool on rack for 10 minutes; run knife blade around
cake edge to loosen and invert cake over plate. Serve warm with
whipped cream and lemon sauce (recipe to follow).

LEMON PUDDING SAUCE: 1 sm. pkg. Lemon Pudding & Pie filling (not
Instant); reserved pear juice, measured; and 2 Tbs. Butter

Mix ingredients according to package except use 1/4 C. less sugar to
prepare the mix.  Cook pudding according to directions; add butter
and cool slightly. Thin with rest of pear juice.
