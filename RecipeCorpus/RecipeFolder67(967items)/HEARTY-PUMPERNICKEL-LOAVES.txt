Beat with an electric mixer, set on high speed, til smooth, about 3
minutes. Add the remaining 1 cup of rye flour and potatoes and beat
for an additional 2 minutes. Stir in the caraway seeds and enough of
the remaining flour to make a SOFT dough. Turn the dough out onto a
floured surface and knead until smooth and satiny, about 5 minutes.
(Dough will still be soft and sticky!) Cover the dough with the bowl
and let rest for 20 minutes. Divide the dough in half and let rest
for 10 minutes.  Form each half into a large ball and place on a
large greased baking sheet. Flatten the loaf slightly with the palm
of the hand and brush with the oil. Let rise in a warm place until
doubled, about 30 minutes.  Bake in a preheated 375 degree F. oven
for 30 to 35 minutes or until the loaves sound hollow when tapped.
Remove from the baking sheet and cool, on wire racks, until cold
before slicing
