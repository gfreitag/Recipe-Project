Cut meat into small pieces and finely chop in a food pro- cessor or
meat grinder. Saute onion and garlic in butter. Add spinach and cook
for 1 minute.

Put the spinach mixture into a bowl and stir in the chopped meat. Add
brandy, egg and seasonings; mix well.

Arrange bacon slices across bottom and sides of 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch
loaf pan, letting slices hang over edge. Put half the meat mixture
into the pan. Arrange hard-cooked eggs (peeled) lengthwise down the
center of the meat pressing down slightly. Put remaining meat on top
and wrap bacon across the top.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Cover pan with aluminum foil. Set in a baking pan with hot water
reaching a third of the way up the sides of the pan. Bake for 1 1/2
hours, or until meat juices run clear. Let stand uncov- ered for 30
minutes. Pour off fat. Cover and put weights on top. Refrigerate 24
hours.

Remove from pan and trim off excess fat. Cut into 1-inch slices and
wrap in clear plastic wrap with gherkins and onions and tie with
ribbon for a delicious gift.
