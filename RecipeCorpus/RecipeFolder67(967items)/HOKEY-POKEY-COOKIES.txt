The big secret he says is to then let the batter sit for 20 minutes
stirring occasionally to let the sugar dissolve for the desired taste
and texture.

Evenly divide batter into two six inch rounds and bake at 325 for
20-24 minutes.  Turn the baking sheet a half turn midway through the
baking time.

Allow to cool for 4 minutes, then cut each round into 4 to 6 wedges.
Allow to cool another 30 minutes.

Heat chocolate in a double boiler, stirring constantly until smooth,
about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and continue stirring until
temperature drops to 90 degrees.

let them sit for 20-25 minutes.
