Title: HOLIDAY LOAF (HELEN)
Categories: Holiday, Vegetarian, Loaf
Yield: 12 Servings
3 1/2 c  Brown rice, cooked
1/2 c  Wild rice, cooked
2 c  Soy milk
4 c  Bread crumbs
2 c  Walnuts, chopped
3 c  Onion, finely chopped
2 c  Celery, finely chopped
4 tb Parsley, chopped
4 tb Soy sauce, low sodium
2 ts Basil, fresh or dry
1/2 ts Sage
1/2 ts Paprika
2 ea Dash pepper
1/2 ts Salt (optional)
6 ts Egg replacer
4 tb Water
Prepare rice (begin with 7/8 cup brown and 1/8 cup wild, uncooked and
add to 2 cups boiling water). I just used my rice cooker and cold
water and it turned out great. Make cashew milk using 1/2 cup cashews
blended with 1/2 cup water. Dissolve egg replacer in 2 Tbsp water.

Place all ingredients into large bowl and mix together well. Press
firmly into nonstick loaf pan and bake at
350    degree oven for 1 hour.

Place serving plate on top and turn over letting loaf drop out onto
plate. Serve with mushroom gravy, entered separately.

Helpful Hints:  Makes a great stuffing.  Also can be served as
"sloppy Joe" covered with marinara

The Holiday Loaf is really delicous, but I would most definately
consider this a rich, feast day type of food. That is why I only
serve in on Thanksgiving.
