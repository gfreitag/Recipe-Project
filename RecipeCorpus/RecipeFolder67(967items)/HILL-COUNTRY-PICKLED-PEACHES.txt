8 lb Whole peaches, sm. to med.
-peeled
6 c  Sugar
4 c  Vinegar
2 c  ;water
4    Cinnamon sticks
1 1/2 tb Whole cloves
2 ts Powdered ginger
1/2 ts White pepper
Combine all the ingredients in a heavy saucepan. Bring the mixture to
a rolling boil over high heat. Boil until the peaches can be pierced
easily with a fork, a matter of minutes; do not allow them to soften.
Remove the pan from the heat, and let the peaches sit in the syrup at
room temperature for at least 8 hours or overnight.

Prepare quart canning jars according to the manufacturer's directions.
Return the pan to the stove and bring the mixture back to a boil.
Spoon the peaches into the jars, wedging them in, and divide the
syrup and spices equally among the jars.  Leave about 1/2-inch of
headspace in each jar. Process the jars for 20 minutes.

For the best taste, store the peaches for at least 2 weeks before
serving them.
