3/4 c  Corn meal
1 c  Whole wheat flour
4 ts Baking powder
3/4 ts Salt

It's good too!)

Substitute) beaten
1/2 c  Water *
Sift together corn meal, flour, baking powder and salt. Add remaining
ingredients; mix well with a spoon. Pour into a 9" round teflon
baking dish (or spray a 9" round glass baking dish with "oil & flour"

* Comment from Rob Ryerson: He had to add 1/2 c water in order to
achieve the consistency of a batter.
