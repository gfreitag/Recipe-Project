To prepare sauces: Mix all ingredients for each sauce in small bowls
and set aside. To prepare dumplings: Finely chop the ground pork.
Combine remaining ingredients, except wrappers and mix well. Put a
small amount of filling in the centre of each wonton skin; by folding
into a triangle, enclose the filling to make a ball-like shape,
sealing the wonton skins with a little water. Leave one corner flap
extended to form a tail and bring the two bottom flats together and
seal with water. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Put the
dumplings, in batches, into the water and boil them until they pop to
the surface. Remove with slotted spoon and serve with the dipping
sauces. From the Lai Lai Resturant in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada
