Title: IMPERIAL SAUCE B1
Categories: Sauces, Chinese, Poultry, Side dish
Yield: 6 Servings
3 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Dry sherry
1/2 c  Chicken broth
Salt & pepper; to taste
Garlic powder; to taste
1 sl Ginger; finely chopped
1/2 ts Sugar
1 pn MSG (optional)
1 ts Cornstarch (rounded)
Combine all ingredients & mix well. MSG is controversial & should not
be. It's used as a flavor enhancer for foods that have little
inherent flavor. The trick is not to use too much, only a dash.
