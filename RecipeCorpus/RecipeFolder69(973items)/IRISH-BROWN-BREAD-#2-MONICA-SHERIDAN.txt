Title: IRISH BROWN BREAD #2 MONICA SHERIDAN
Categories: Breads, Irish
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Stone Ground
Whole wheat flour
2 c  White flour
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
2 c  Buttermilk or sweet milk
2 tb Butter
2 tb Sugar
Mix the whole wheat flour throughly with the white flour. Rub the
butter into the flours. Add the salt, and soda.

Make a well in the center and gradually mix in the liquid. Stir with a
wooden spoon. You may need less, or more liquid - it depends on the
absorbent quality of the flour. the dough should be soft but
managable.

Knead the dough into a ball in the mixing bowl with your floured
hands.

Put in on a lightly floured baking sheet and with the palm of your
hand flatten out in a circle 1 1/2 inches thick. with a knife dipped
in flour, make a cross through the center of the bread so that it
will easily break into quarters when it is baked.

Bake at 425 degrees for 25 minutes, reduce the heat to 350 degrees
and bake a further 15 minutes.

If the crust seems too hard, wrap the baked bread in a damp tea cloth.
Leave the loaf standing upright until it is cool.

The bread should not be cut until it has set - about 6 hours after it
comes out of the oven.
