Souffl omelettes are spectacular dishes, yet they are disarmingly
simple to prepare. The Indonesian spicing of this dish, and the
coconut milk which is so typical of that cuisine, make this a meal to
remember. Serve it with a couple of salads of your choice.

Soften the ginger and garlic in the oil for 2-3 minutes, then toss in
the prepared vegetables. Stir until heated through and well coated
with the oil, then add the ground peanuts. Stir well. Pour in the
coconut milk and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, then mix
in the beaten egg yolks and stir thoroughly. Season to taste.

Fold in the stiffly beaten whites and pour the mixture into a large,
well-oiled, heavy frying-pan. Cook over a very gentle heat for 8-10
minutes until puffed and beginning to set. Brown under a hot grill
for a minute or two to finish the cooking, and serve immediately
garnished with fresh coriander leaves. Cut into wedges for each
serving.
