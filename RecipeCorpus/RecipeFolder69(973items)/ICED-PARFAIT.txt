In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar and water

egg yolks. While the machine is running, pour the sugar mixture into
the egg yolks, mixing until the mixture is cool. Add the coconut
extract. In a small bowl, whip the chilled cream and milk together
until very firm. Fold the whipped cream into the egg mixture, then
slowly fold in the toasted coconut. Pour into a loaf pan and freeze

slightly loosen it from the sides of the mold. Set a platter on top
of the mold and invert. Garnish with more coconut and mint sprigs.
