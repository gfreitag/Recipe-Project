Title: IRISH FRECKLE BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
Jim Vorheis
4 3/4 c  To 5 3/4 cups unsifted flour
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
2 pk Dry yeast
1 c  Potato water
1/2 c  Margarine
2    Eggs, room temperature
1/4 c  Mashed potatoes, room
-temperature
1 c  Seedless raisins
In a large bowl thoroughly mix 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, salt and
undissolved yeast.  Combine potato water and margarine in saucepan.
Heat over low heat until liquid is warm - the margarine does not need
to melt. Gradually add to dry ingredients and beat for 2 minutes at
medium speed with electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add
eggs, potatoes and 1/2 cup flour, or enough flour to make a thick
batter. Stir in raisins and enough additional flour to make a soft
dough. Turn out onto floured board. Knead until smooth and elastic,
about 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning dough to grease.
Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down.  Turn out
onto lightly floured board. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Shape
each piece into a slender loaf, about 8 1/2 inches long. Put 2
loaves, side by side, in each of 2 greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 inch
loaf pans. Cover. Let rise in warm place, free from draft until
doubled in bulk.  Bake in preheated 375 F oven for 35 minutes, or
until done. Remove from pans and cool on wire racks.
