Title: ITALIAN "SAUSAGE" SEITAN
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  TVP
3/8 c  Boiling water
1/4 ts Garlic salt
1/4 ts Garlic powder
1/4 ts Ground fennel
1/2 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Black pepper
1    Egg white
1/4 c  Bread crumbs
Mix the TVP into the hot water. Let stand for a few minutes. Add
everything else and form into two patties. Fry in non-stick pan.

It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. If anyone makes it I'd appreciate
comments and suggestions.
