Morellos are sour cherries; they may be either light red or dark,
almost black, red.  Any other sour cherries may be substituted. To be
used safely, cherry pits and stems must be combined wiht the other
ingredients and cooked as soon as they are removed from the cherries.

Crush a few of the cherry pits, then put all the pits and stems into
a pan with the wine, sugar, cinnamon stick and the juice of both
lemons and peel of one. Simmer for 5 minutes, then leave to steep for
at least 15 minutes. Strain, bring back to a boil and add the
cherries and their juice. Remove from the heat immediately and allow
to cool to tepid. Stir in the brandy. Put the sour cream into a
tureen, then gradually pour in the cherry soup, mixing thoroughly.
Serve chilled.
