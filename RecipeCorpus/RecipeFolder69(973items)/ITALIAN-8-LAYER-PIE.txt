TO MAKE DOUGH in the food processor, place the steel blade in the
processor bowl.  Add flour, cold butter, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
Process with serveral on/off turns till mixture resembles coarse
cornmeal. combine egg, egg white, and milk; add to processor and
process till mixture forms a ball. (Or, for the mixing bowl method,
combine flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium mixing bowl; cut in
butter till mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add egg mixture; mix
with a spoon or your hands till mixture forms a ball.) Cover dough;
chill while preparing filling.

FOR FILLING, cut roasted sweet pepper into strips; set aside. Drain
spinach squeezing to remove excess liquid. In a 10-inch skillet cook
fennel and leeks in hot oil for 5 to 7 minutes or till tender. In a
mixing bowl stir together drained spinach, ricotta, mozarella, pesto,
Parmesan, the first egg yolk and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.

ON A LIGHTLY FLOURED SURFACE roll 2/3's of the chilled dough into a
12-inch diameter circle.  Place the dough in an 8-inch sprinform pan
(the dough will go about 2-1/2 inches up the sides). Press pleats in
dough as necessary to fit.  Spread the bottom crust with half of the
fennel mixture. Top with half of the spinach mixture, half of the
salami, and half of the red pepper strips. Repeat layers.

ROLL REMAINING DOUGH into an 8-inch circle; place atop filling. (You
may want to save a few dough scraps for decorating the top of the
pie.) Fold excess bottom crust over top crust; crimp edge to seal. If
desired, cut reserved dough scraps into shapes and use to decorate
the top of the pie. Or, cut a design, such as a leaf or a flower, out
of the top. (If you don't cut a design out of top crust make a few
slits in the top crust to let steam escape while baking.)  Brush with
remaining egg yolk. Bake in a 375-degree oven about 50 minutes or
till golden. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove sides of pan to
