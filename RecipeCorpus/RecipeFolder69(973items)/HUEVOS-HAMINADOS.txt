Title: HUEVOS HAMINADOS
Categories: Cyberealm, Kooknet, Jewish
Yield: 12 Servings
About 12 raw eggs in shells
Water
Skins from several onions
1/4 c  Oil, approximately
Put the eggs in one layer of a large pot, and cover them with several
inches of cool water. If desired, add the onion skins to the water to
tint the shells brown and subtly flavor the eggs. (Onion skins are
not necessary to tint the egg albumen brown. This happens because of
the long cooking.) Pour the oil on top of the water; it helps keep
the water from evaporating during the extended cooking process.
Slowly bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat; then cover
the pot tightly and lower the heat so the eggs simmer very gently.
Simmer them on top of the stove, or place the pot in a 225F oven, and
cook for at least 8 hours or overnight. Serve the eggs warm, at room
temperature, or chilled. They may be reheated by boiling them for 3-5
minutes.
