1 qt Milk -- low fat
2 tb Nonfat dry milk powder
2 tb Yogurt Starter OR -- dry
Culture
Plain yogurt -- room temp
Combine milk and nonfat dry milk in a large deep bowl. Heat 12
minutes at FULL POWER or to boiling. Cool to 115F; monitor
temperature with a microwave thermometer. Combine starter with about
1/2 cup cooled milk; mix lightly until smooth.   Add milk mixture to
remaining milk, mixing until well blended. Pour into warmed, large
deep bowl. Place temperature probe into milk; cover with plastic
wrap. Insert probe into oven. To incubate, heat to 113F on FULL
POWER; hold at that temperature 3 1/2 to 5 1/2 hours. (Reset timer as
needed) Chill. Yogurt will continue to thicken as it chills.   Makes
about 4 cups.   NOTE: Drain liquid from yogurt after chilled. Yogurt
will become thin if liquid is stirred in.
