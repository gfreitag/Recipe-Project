Title: IRISH STEW [BIDDY WHYTE LENNON]
Categories: Lamb/mutton, Stews, Irish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Stewing lamb or mutton
2 lg Onions
3 lb Potatoes
1 bn Parsley, fresh; large
2 ts Thyme, fresh; chopped
;Water
Salt & pepper
Peel the onions and slice them into rounds.  Peel the potatoes as
thinly as possible.  Leave them whole unless they are very large.

Cut the meat into good-sized pieces.  Small chops can be left whole,
larger ones divided in two. Place a layer of onions on the bottom of
a heavy casserole, and the meat on top of them. Sprinkle chopped
thyme and parsley generously, and season well. Layer the rest of the
onions with the potatoes.  Sprinkle thyme and parsley again at the
last. The amount of water you need to add depends on how good the
seal is between your pot and its lid, and whether you like a "wet" or
"dry" stew. You will certainly not need more than two cups, and I use
barely one. Bring the water to a boil, cover as tightly as possible,
and place in a preheated oven at 300F for 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Keep an
eye on it towards the end, and adjust the gravy by adding a little
water if you think it too dry. A good stew should have some gravy,
but should not be flooded by it. "Floury" potatoes will dissolve into
the gravy, "waxy" ones will not. I tend to use a mixture. Serve very
hot with more fresh chopped parsley sprinkled on top. White soda
bread to mop up the gravy.

"There are more arguments about what makes a real Irish stew than
about any other recipe in the repertoire. Some people claim that if
you put carrots in it, it's not an Irish stew any more.  Others say,
leave the carrots in, but no parsnips! -- and the arguments go on."
