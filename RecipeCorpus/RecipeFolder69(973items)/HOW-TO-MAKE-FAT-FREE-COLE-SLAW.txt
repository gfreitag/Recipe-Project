Title: HOW TO MAKE FAT FREE COLE SLAW
Categories: Main dish, Text file, Digest
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Ea	head of  cabbage.
Chapter 1: Preparing the slaw. What makes coleslaw really good is the
"pickling" of the cabbage. First you slice the cabbage real thin
layering it in a bowl with a generous amountof salt (you will
eventually wash all this salt away), then you place the ca hours
until the cabbage is wilted and well... pickled. My father used to
place the cabbage directly on top of one of the big refridgerator
compressor in the back room. Once "pickled" throughly wash to remove
as much salt as possible.

Chapter 2: Other ingredients

Here are a bunch of suggestions to add variety to your slaw

~ thinly sliced red or yellow or green onions ~ Red cabbage as well as
green ~ A good slaw must have grated carrots - bean sprouts

Chapter 3: Dressings

Now for dressings. Mayo is out but there are lots of alternatives

~ Balsamic or rice vinegar to taste (if you "pickle the cabbage first,
you'll need less vinegar) ~ Ginger, vinegar and sugar (kind of sweet
and sour) ~ Vinegar (ginger and sugar) and roasted mustard seed (add
a nice look and crunch, to roast the mustard seed, heat a heavy
sautee pan and add the seed to the hot dry pan for about 30 seconds
to a minute) ~ Vinegar and a good dijon mustard

Remember to let the slaw sit in its dressing for a while before
serving.

Happy slawing!
