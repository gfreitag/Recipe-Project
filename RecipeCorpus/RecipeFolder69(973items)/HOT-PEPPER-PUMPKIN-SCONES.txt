Yield: 12 To 14
1    Stick unsalted butter
1/2 sm Onion, finely chopped
1    Jalapeno peppers, stemmed,
-seeded, and finely diced
2 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground ginger
1/8 ts Ground allspice
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Pumpkin puree
6 tb Buttermilk or plain yogurt

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a small skillet, melt the butter over medium heat, add chopped
onion and jalapeno and stir until onion is soft (about 2 minutes).
Set aside to cool.

In a large bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, soda, cinnamon, ginger,
allspice, salt, and sugar. MIx in the melted butter until mixture
resembles grains of rice. Make a well in the center and add
buttermilk, pumpkin puree and egg to the well. Mix together with a
fork and gradually work in the mixture until a soft, cohesive dough
forms.

greased cookie sheet.  Bake in a preheated oven for 20 minutes, until
puffed and firm on surface, but fluffy in the center. Transfer to a
cooling rack, cover loosely with a dish towel and cool for at least
5    minuntes.

Mix honey with the jalapeno sauce and brush tops of the scones with
this mixture before serving.
