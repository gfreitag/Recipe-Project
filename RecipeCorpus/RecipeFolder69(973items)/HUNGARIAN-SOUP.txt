Prepare vegetables, cutting the onion and celery fine and leaving the
potatoes and carrots in fairly large pieces.

Bring barley and peas to rolling boil in water. Add vegetables, wine
and seasonings; simmer until barley and all the vegetables are very
tender, about 2 - 2 1/2 hours. About thirty minutes before serving,
add the V-8 juice or vegetable stock and a "roux" made of the butter
and flour. Watch carefully as the soup thickens, lest it stick to the
pot.
