Categories: Relishes
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Cooking apples
1 lb Onion, chopped
2    Garlic cloves, crushed
3/4 c  Golden raisins
2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2 1/2 c  Malt vinegar
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Ground ginger
1 ts Mustard seeds
1/4 ts Dry mustard
1 tb Tomato paste
Peel, core and coarsely chop apples.

Put apples, onions, garlic and raisins into a saucepan. Add salt,
sugar, vinegar and spices and mix well. Heat gently, stirring to
dissolve sugar.

Bring to a boil and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in
tomato paste and continue cooking 7-8 minutes longer or until mixture
is of a thick consistency with very little free liquid, stirring
frequently. Meanwhile, wash 3 pint jars in hot soapy water; rinse.
Keep hot until needed. Prepare lids as manufacturer directs. Ladle
chutney into 1 hot jar at a time, leaving 1/4" headspace. Release
trapped air. Wipe rim of jar with a clean damp cloth. Attach lid and
place in canner. Fill and close remaining jars. Process 10 minutes in
a boiling-water bath.

Makes about 3 pint jars.

NOTE: This chutney improves if stored at least 3 weeks before serving.
Garnish with an Italian parsley sprig, if desired, and serve as an
accompaniment to curries or with crusty bread and cheese.
