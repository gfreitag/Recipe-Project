Title: HOW TO COOK A DUCK
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 2 Servings
1    Duckling, (4- to 5-lb)
1 tb Kosher salt
1 ts Ground black pepper
REMOVE ANY GIBLETS from the cavity of the bird and reserve. Remove
any fat deposits from the cavity and cut off excess skin around the
neck. Rinse the bird under cold running water and pat dry. Sprinkle
the cavity with salt and pepper. Sever the wing tips at the first
joint and reserve with the giblets. Tie the legs together at the
ankles and sprinkle the outside of the duck with salt and pepper. If
you don't have a steamer, improvise one. Use a roasting rack or
create one by placing 2 small heatproof baking dishes or loaf pans
upside down in a larger roasting pan. Fill roasting pan with a 2-inch
depth of water and place the bird breast up on the rack. Cover
tightly with the lid or with aluminum foil. Place over high heat on
top of the stove. When the water boils, reduce heat to low and steam
approximately 15 minutes per pound. Remove from the heat and transfer
the birds to a plate. Strain the steaming liquid into a container,
cool and place in the refrigerator. When chilled, remove the fat and
pack into containers, discarding any water. Place in the refrigerator
until ready to cook, or in the freezer for up to 1 year. Use the fat
for frying and sauteeing. Place the bird on its side in a roasting
pan, add reserved giblets, neck and wings, place in the oven and turn
oven temperature to 350F. After about 15 minutes, turn birds on the
other side and cook an additional 10 minutes. Turn the bird breast up
and cook another 20 minutes, basting the bird as it renders fat. In
all, cook about 9 minutes per pound or about 45 minutes for a 5-lb
duck, about 7 minutes per pound for an 11-lb goose. Remove the bird
from the oven and set the bird aside on a platter. Remove any
trussing and serve with sauce.
