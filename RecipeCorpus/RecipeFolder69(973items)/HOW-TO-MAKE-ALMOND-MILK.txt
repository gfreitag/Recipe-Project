1. soak 1/2 cup almonds for about 12 hours then rinse. 2. soak in
boiling water for about 30 sec then immerse in cold water. Then
squeeze them out of their husks (blanching) 3. put almonds, 1/2 cup
water and about 2 tbsp of sweetener (maple syrup) in and blend away.
Add another 1 1/2 cup of water and continue to blend. 4. (optional)
filter off gritty almond pulp, you can use it for a great facial
scrub by adding it to a liquid soap. 5. Store in the fridge, it keeps
for about 3 days.(but ours has lasted for about 5+days)

Source: I got this recipe from 'May All Be Fed' by John Robbins, good
book by the way. I got it at Cole's for cheap. Just to show you that
the best things in life are cheap.
