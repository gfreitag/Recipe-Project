Title: INDIAN POT ROAST (AI)
Categories: Beef, Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
4 lb Pot Roast
2    Cloves Garlic
4 tb Butter
Salt
Flour
MMMMM-------------------------IF DESIRED------------------------------
12    Whole Peppercorns
12    Whole Allspice
1    Bay Leaf, crumbled
1 tb Grated Horseradish
1/2 c  Rum or Dry Red Wine
1/2 c  Water
1 lg Onion
1    Recipe Dumplings
Carrots (small or
-quartered)
MMMMM-------------------------DUMPLINGS------------------------------
2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
4 ts Baking Powder
1    Scant C Milk
Mash the garlic and saute in the butter. Rub the meat with salt and
flour and brown it well on all sides in the butter. Lay the meat on a
bed or thin-sliced onion in a large Dutch oven or any pot with a
tight-fitting lid. Add the butter, the spices and seasonings and pour
the rum or wine over the meat. (A good pot roast will supply most of
its own juices, but as it cooks pour the 1/2 C water over it to make
an ample supply of gravy.) Cover tightly and simmer for 3 to 4 hours
until the roast is tender. This may be done either in the oven or on
the back of the stove. If you want carrots with the pot roast, add
them to the pot for the last half hour of cooking and for the last 12
minutes of cooking add the dumplings to steam in the flavors of the
pot. When the roast is done, remove it to a hot, round platter and
surround with the dumplings and carrots. Stir the grave until smooth,
correcting the seasoning if necessary. Pour it over the roast; if
fresh dill is available, cut it over the dish with a lavish hand.
Serves 6-8

DUMPLINGS

Sift together the dry ingredients and add the milk gradually. Drop by
the spoonful into the gravy and cook with pot toast or stew during
the last 12 minutes of cooking.
