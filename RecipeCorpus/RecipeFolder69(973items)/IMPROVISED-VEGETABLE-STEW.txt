Title: IMPROVISED VEGETABLE STEW
Categories: Digest, Oct.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 sm Eggplant
1/2    Butternut squash (or
"pumkin" for the Aussies on
The list!)
1 md Potato
1 ea Red and green bell pepper
(capsicum)
1    Heaping huge spoonful
(according to taste) cooked
Onions*
1 cn Tomatoes and juice
1    Splash red wine
1    Splash balsamic vinegar
1    Veggie stock cube
2    Cloves (few) crushed garlic
1 ts Turmeric
1 ts Ginger, grated
1 ts Cumin
1 ts Chili powder
Cut up the vegies into chunks of roughly the same size, and cook over
medium high heat in a non-stick skillet (no need to spray!)

I tossed everything around in the skillet for a while, then chucked
it into a casserole dish in the oven on medium-ish heat for 45
minutes while we went out for our pre-dinner walk. You can adjust the
seasonings to your own taste.

I served this over rice steamed with a small handful of sultanas
(golden raisins), and it was delicious.

*About the onions. I think onions make anything taste a little more
delicious, so as often as I need to, I get a couple of pounds (a
kilo) of onions, slice them up in the food processor, put them into
the non-stick skillet with just a little veggie stock (adding more as
needed to stop sticking) over a medium heat, not stirring too often,
for about an hour. After a while, they do stick a bit, and that's a
great time to splash in a little red wine or balsamic vinegar to
deglaze the pan. Then let them cook a little longer, until they have
a beautiful caramel color and delicious, rich aroma. I keep them
stored in the fridge and add them to anything and everything. There's
nothing like them on a veggie pizza to make you forget they don't
make ff cheese in Australia (yet!)
