Soda Bread: This bread, which many consider the Irish soda bread, is
usually served at high teas and other important occasions.

Sift flour, sugar, salt and baking soda into a large bowl. Stir in
currants to coat with flour.  Stir in buttermilk just until flour is
moistened. Knead dough in bowl with lightly floured hands, 10 times.
Turn dough out onto lightly floured cookie sheet and shape into an
8-inch round. Cut a cross into top with a floured knife. Bake in hot
oven (400 degrees), for 40 minutes, until loaf turns golden and gives
a hollow sound when tapped. Cool completely before slicing.
