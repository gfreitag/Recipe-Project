PEARLY GREATS: Smoked oysters are packed in oil. Drain and pat dry
with paper towels. Layer, 1 cracker with a leaf or two of arugula and
a plump oyster; garnish the plate with freshly cracked peppers, pink,
green and black. Watercress would work well, too. CLAWS CELEBRE aka
Lobster Raita: Mix cucumber, seafood, onion, seasonings with yogurt;
thin with buttermilk. Separate radicchio leaves, small, curled into a
cup shape. Divide seafood salad into four servings. (about 100 cal)
BOURSIN Cheese is creamy, flavorful, fairly light. Whip the cheese
with softened sun-dried tomatoes. Dieters spread 1 tables on three
bread slices. (110 cals for all three). CRABBY ARTICHOKES: Artichoke
bottoms are bite-size edible cups, come in a can or jar, cleaned and
ready to eat. Fill each 'cup' with a mixture of tarragon and crab
salad. (3 cups, filled, 187 cal, 4.8 g fat) DATES STUFFED WITH
ALMONDS: That 's it.  Matthew Kenny, a NY chef, so simple, so
popular. He leaves the skin on the almond but you could use blanched.
