-THE CAKE
6    Eggs, seperated
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Pureed pumpkin
1 ts Mixed pumpkin pie spice
1/3 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
-THE FILLING
1 c  Heavy cream
1/4 c  Powdered sugar
1/2 c  Cooked pureed pumpkin
1/2 ts Mixed pumpkin pie spice
1 c  Chopped toasted pecans
1 ts Vanilla
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 10 1/2-by 15 1/2-inch
jelly-roll pan with parchment or wax paper, and grease the paper
well. To prepare the pumpkin roll, beat the egg yolks and granulated
sugar until light and thick. Blend in 1/2 cup pumpkin puree, 1
teaspoon pumpkin spice, flour, and baking powder. Beat egg whites
with salt, until firm peaks form. Fold whites into yolk mixture. Pour
batter into the prepared pan. Bake 15 minutes, until cake bounces
back when touched in the center. Turn out onto wax paper that has
been sprinkled with powdered sugar. Immediately peel off top paper
and carefully roll up cake, making the roll lengthwise. Cool.
Meanwhile prepare filling. Whip the cream until stiff, beating in
1/4 cup powdered sugar. Blend in 1/2 cup pumpkin puree, 1/2 teaspoon
pumpkin spice, pecans, and vanilla. Unroll cooled cake. Spread with
the filling, and roll it up again. Chill 2 to 4 hours. When ready to
serve, sprinkle with additional powdered sugar.
