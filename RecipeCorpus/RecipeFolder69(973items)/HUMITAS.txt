Title: HUMITAS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
8    Ears of fresh corn
With shucks on
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
3 tb Butter
1 ts Sugar
1    Onion chopped
1/4 c  Milk (evaporated is best)
1    Tomato peeled, seeded,
& chopped
2    Eggs beaten
Cut corn off of the cobs. Save cobs & husks! Take the largest husks,
put into a pan of boiling water to soften. Heat the butter in a pan,
add the onion, & cook til soft. Add the tomato, salt & pepper, &
sugar and cook for 5-6 minutes. Add the corn, milk, & eggs and cook
for 10 minutes. Stir constantly while this step is in progress.
Remove the husks from the water and dry. Place 3 Tblspns of the corn
mixture on the center of each husk. Fold the sides of the husks over
to form a small package. (use 2 leaves if you need to do so) tie with
string. Place cobs in the bottom of the pot of boiling water and
place the humitas on top of the cobs. Cover pot for 30 minutes. Serve
hot! I like to add a bit of garlic to mine. I also use the Sriracha
or Tuong hot sauce too!
