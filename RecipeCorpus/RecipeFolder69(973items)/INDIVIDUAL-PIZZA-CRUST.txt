Title: INDIVIDUAL PIZZA CRUST
Categories: Pizza, Low-fat
Yield: 8 Servings
3/4 c  Lukewarm water
1 ts Honey
1 tb Dry active yeast
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Semolina
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Olive oil
1/2 c  Cornmeal
Light vegetable oil cooking
- spray
Mix the water and honey together in a medium stainless steel bowl.
Sprinkle the yeast on top and set it aside for about 20 minutes to
proof, until bubbles form on the surface.  Put the flour, semolina,
and salt into the bowl of a food processor.  Turn the machine on and
slowly add the yeast mixture through the feed tube.  Process for
about a minute, until a dough ball forms, drizzling a little
additional water into the feed tube if necessary.  Continue to
process for another 2 minutes.  Rub the surface of a large bowl with
the olive oil.  Transfer the dough ball to the bowl and roll it in
the oil to coat.  Cover with a towel and set the bowl aside in a warm
place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the
oven to 400 degrees.  Remove the dough to a work surface that has
been dusted with the cornmeal and roll out evenly to a thickness of
about 1/4 inch.  Cut out eight 5 1/2-inch circles, using a sharp
knife and a saucer of that circumference.  Spray a cookie sheet with
Pam spray and place the pizzas onto the sheet.  Bake for about 5
minutes or until golden in color. Remove the baked crusts from the
oven and add the toppings of your choice.
