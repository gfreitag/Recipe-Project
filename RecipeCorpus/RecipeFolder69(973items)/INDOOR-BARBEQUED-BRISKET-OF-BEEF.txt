Prepare the rub: Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Store
the mixture in an airtight container for up to four months. There's
no need to refrigerate it.

To use the rub: Massage it into the meat thoroughly the night before
you plan to grill or bake. Wrap the meat well in plastic wrap and
place in the refrigerator until cooking time, so the flavors will be
absorbed into the meat.

Cover and bake 5 hours at 275. Drain off grease. Set aside.

Mix all ingredients for sauce and boil 15 minutes. Pour sauce over
meat, bake uncovered for one additional hour.
