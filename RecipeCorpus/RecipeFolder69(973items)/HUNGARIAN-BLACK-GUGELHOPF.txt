This particular recipe uses poppyseeds and chocolate for an unusual
but delicious variation of the master gugelhopf. Directions are the
original old fashioned way the first gugelhops were baked. For the
yeast, mix all ingredients and set aside 30 minutes or very foamy and
doubled. For the batter all ingredients must be room temperature.
Cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in the yolks and eggs and
blend well. Stir in the poppyseeds, chocolate, cinnamon and honey and
lemon rind. Beat in the flour and salt with a spoon. Add the yeast
mixture and beat until the batter is silky smooth. Fill a greased 8
inch kugelhopf pan ( turks head mold )and let the mixture rise ,
covered with a towel about 1 inch from the top of the pan which
should take 1 1/2 hours. Bake cake at 450 for 20 minutes ( this cause
the characteristic brown top crust ) and then reduce heat to 350 and
bake the cake until done, maybe another 30 minutes or tested done.
Invert the cake, loosen and cool completely. dust top with powdered
sugar. ~---
