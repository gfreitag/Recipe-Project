-DOLORES MCCANN (BSWN00A)
Liquid type/candy mold
Marachino cherries in juice
Dry candy fondant
Compound coating chocolate
~Fill a sqeeze bottle with melted <coating> chocolate. ~Sqeeze out
choc. into ea. mold cavity. -Tilt the mold to be sure ea cavity is
coated clear to the tops all around. -Invert mold over wax paper &
prop with <flexible plastic c > <so mold isn't touching wax paper.>
<<<OR>>> -Invert over foil sheet pan w/cake rack in it. -Let the
excess choc. drip out. -When choc. starts to set up <not shiny & is
"rubbery">, use a small <Wilton> <bent> spatula to scrape off
drippings level at tops of ea cavity. READY TO ADD SYRUP: -Have mixed
& in separate sqeeze bottle: 1 part Marachino cherry juice 10 parts
Dry Candy Fondant This should be the consistancy of Karo syrup. Don't
worry you can't ruin this! After you have mixed the ingredients
together in a bowl, pour into the squeeze bottle. DRY MARACHINO
CHERRIES ON PAPER TOWELS & place one in each cavity. Add syrup to
1/4" from the top. ~Using the squeeze bottle of chocolate <work in
spiral from outside/into center, add chocolate on the top to
carefully seal. ~Chill <only> until chocolate separates from the mold
<about 10 minutes.> More time may crack the choc. shells. <<Chill in
freezer section>> -Invert mold to dump out finished cherries
CAREFULLY! They may crack if they hit the table hard & you have to
eat all your mistakes <VBG>. -I wrap EVERY one in the little foil
candy wraps. If you don't wrap, "leakers" develope. That costs too &
is messy. I use the cherries in the pretty foil to add color to my
candy boxes.

Remelt "drippings" of chocolate. I use 5 molds at a time. More & the
chocolate may set up too quick for you. I think I make about 100 an
hour, maybe more, this way.

<<<NO parafin <candle wax poo>>> USE COATING CHOCOLATE! These
completely liquify in 1-2 days easy, if not sooner still. Keep
covered tightly <wrap box also in plastic <Saran>> & store in cool
place. Keeps about 3-4 weeks. The cherries don't spoil. "Bloom"
occurs when chocolate is not tightly sealed. Dolores
