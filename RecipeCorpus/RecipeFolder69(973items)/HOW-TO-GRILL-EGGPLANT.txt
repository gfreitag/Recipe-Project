Title: HOW TO GRILL EGGPLANT
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Eggplant
x  Oil
x  Balsamic vinegar
x  Herbs of choice
Start by slicing the eggplant into quarter inch slices lengthwise -
this goes for other veggies that you want to grill with it - I
recommend yellow squash and zucchini. Marinate in a baking dish with
olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and jsut about any herbs that turn you
on. I recommend mint and oregano.  Add chopped garlic and salt and
pepper to taste. Marinate for about an hour and grill over a medium
grill until they're nicely soft and grilled.  Serve warm and bask in
the glow of compliments from your friends.
