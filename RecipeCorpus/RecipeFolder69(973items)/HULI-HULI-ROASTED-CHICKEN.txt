the sugar is thoroughly dissolved. Place the chicken on the spit and
brush with the glaze every few minutes until the glaze starts to

minutes before carving. If a spit is not available, just roast the
chicken in the oven on a rack with a cup of water in the roasting
pan. The chicken juices, marinade and water will mix to make a
wonderful glaze to baste the chicken with aobut every 5-l0 minutes.
