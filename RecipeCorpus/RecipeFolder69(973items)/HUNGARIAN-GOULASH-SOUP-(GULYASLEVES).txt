Soup Body

Saute the onion in fat until golden.  Add the beef and stir until well
browned.  Add salt, paprika, and tomatoes, and let simmer (adding a
little water to prevent over-browning) for 30 minutes. Sprinkle the
flour over the meat, stir, and pour enough water to cover the meat
well. Add carrot, parsnip, green pepper, and bring to a boil. Turn to
low heat and simmer for 10 minutes.  Add potatoes and more water (to
soup consistency). Salt to taste.  Simmer until potatoes and meat are
well cooked.

Pinched Noodles

Combine ingredients with enough flour to make a medioum dough. Drop
tiny noodles from a spoon into simmering soup. When the noodles float
to the surface, they are done.  A good alternative to the spoon is to
put the dough on a cutting board, use a flat edged knife to cut off a
portion of the dough, roll the portion along the length of the board
(producing a length like a piece of licorice) and then cut of 0.75
inch pieces to drop in the soup.  Note that this can be done right
over the pot.

Add "pinched noodles" and boil a few minutes longer with the chopped
parsley.  Do not add to many noodles as they are there only to add a
different flavour and consistency (versus the intent to bulk up the
soup). Serve in a deep bowl.
