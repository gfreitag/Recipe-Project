Title: ILEEN'S BROWN BREAD
Categories: Low fat, Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 qt Warm water
6 tb Instant potato flakes
6 c  Stone-ground whole wheat
Flour
4 c  Stone-ground rye flour
2 c  Steel-cut oatmeal
2 pk Active dry yeast
1/2 c  Oil
1/2 c  Molasses
1 tb Salt
3 lg Eggs, beaten
1    Egg mixed with 1 tbsp water
For glaze
Sesame seeds or wheat germ
Combine the flours & oatmeal.  Set aside. Whisk together potato
flakes in warm water.  Add yeast, stirring until dissolved. Add the
oil, molasses & salt.  Beat in 4 cups of the flour mixture until
smooth. Cover & let proof 20 -30 minutes or til light & bubbly. Stir
down the sponge & add the eggs. Gradually add sufficient flour
mixture to make a soft, workable dough that pulls away from the sides
of the bowl. Turn out onto a floured surface & knead 8 - 10 minutes
until smooth & resilient. Place the dough in a warm, buttered bowl,
turning to coat the top. Cover loosely with plastic wrap & a towel
and let rise until doubled, about 1 - 1 1/2 hours.

Punch down the dough & turn out onto a floured surface. Divide into 4
equal portions.  Knead each piece, cover & let rest 10 - 15 minutes.
Butter four 8 1/2" loaf pans. Form the dough into loaves & place in
the pans. Cover & let rise until just curved over tops of pans, about
30 -40 minutes. Brush the loaves with the glaze & sprinkle with seeds
or wheat germ.

Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Let cool on wire racks.
