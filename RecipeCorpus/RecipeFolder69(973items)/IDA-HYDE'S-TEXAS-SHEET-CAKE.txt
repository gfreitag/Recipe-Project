1/2 c  Margarine
4 ts Cocoa; generous
6 ts Buttermilk
1 lb Sugar, confectioners
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Nuts; chopped, or to taste
Cake:  In a mixing bowl, mix sugar, flour and soda together. In a
saucepan, melt margarine; stir in cocoa and water and bring to a
boil. Pour hot mixture over dry ingredients; stir well. Mix in
buttermilk, eggs and salt. Pour into a greased jelly roll pan. Bake
at 400 degrees F. for about 15 minutes, until top springs back when
touched.

Frosting: In same saucepan used for cake, melt margarine. Stir in
cocoa and buttermilk and bring to a rapid boil. Remove from heat and
stir in the sugar and vanilla; blend thoroughly. Stir in nuts. Spread
over cake as soon as it comes out of the oven. Be prepared to clean
up some drips.

If there are kids around, let them clean up the drips ~ this frosting
is like fudge! The frosting is so good ~ it's almost like the cake
exists just to give a base to the frosting. Mom cuts the frosting
recipe down (about in half) but I like it just the way it is - lots.
