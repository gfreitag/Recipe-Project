Mango sorbet are always delicious but this one has the added interest
of lime and cardamom flavours.  The recipe comes from the recently
published "Quick and Easy Indian Vegetarian Cookery" by Sandeep
Chatterjee. BBC Books, 1992, $16.95.

Put 150 g sugar in a small saucepan with 150 mL water. Stir until the
sugar has dissolved then simmer briskly 3 to 4 minutes to make a
syrup. Remove from the heat and chill. When it is cold, add it to 275
g ripe mango pulp, together with the juice of 1 lime and a third of a
tablespoon of ground cardamom.

Mix well and then freeze in a metal container.  As it is freezing,
whisk it with a fork from time to time.

Serves 4 to 6.
