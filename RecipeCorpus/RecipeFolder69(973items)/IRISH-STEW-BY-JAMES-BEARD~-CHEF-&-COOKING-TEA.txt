Trim the fat from the chops, leaving the meat on the bones. Butter a
2 or 2-1/2 quart casserole dish. Preheat the oven to 300dF. In the
bottom of the casserole dish arrange a layer of one-third of the
potatoes and cover with a layer of chops topped with a third of the
parsley-thyme mixture. Add a layer of half the onions, then a third
more potatoes, the remaining chops, herbs, remaining onions, and
finally, the remaining potatoes and herbs. Season well with salt and
pepper and add the water. Cover and cook the stew in the preheated
over for 2 to 2-1/2 hours, or until the meal is tender and the
potatoes and onions are soft. Serve in soup plates with a sprinkling
of parsley on top, and drink beer with with if you'd like. Irish stew
always benefits from being cooked the day before and allowed to cool
thoroughly. You may refrigerate. Skim off any fat and reheat the stew
before serving.
