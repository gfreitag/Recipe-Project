Title: HUBBARD SQUASH-ALMOND CRISP
Categories: Fruits, Desserts
Yield: 10 Servings
4 lb Hubbard squash
1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Brandy
2 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Slivered blanched almonds
3 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Brown sugar
1 ts Ground cinnamon
10 tb Unsalted butter; softened
1/2 c  Amaretti cookies; crushed
1 pt Heavy cream; chilled
Preheat oven to 400 F. Toast almonds and chop fine.

Halve the squash lenghwise, and remove seeds and fiber. Place squash,
cut side down, in a shallow baking dish large enough to hold the
squash in a single layer. Pour in the water. Bake, covered for 30
minutes. Remove dish from oven, turn squash over and cool. Use a
spoon to remove the flesh. Cut into 2-inch cubes. Place squash in a
bowl, drizzle with brandy, sprinkle with sugar and set aside for 30
minutes to macerate.

In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar and cinnamon. Mix in
the butter, working with your fingers until the mixture holds
together and is crumbly. Stir in the chopped almonds and the crushed
amaretti cookies. Set aside.

Place squash and juice in a 12-inch round baking dish. Spread the
almond mixture evenly over them. Bake for 1 hour, or until the squash
is bubbling and the topping is golden brown. To serve, scoop hot
crisp into individual dessert bowls and drizzle with chilled heavy
cream.
