In a food processor or blender mix GROUP A In a bowl stir the pint of
yogurt (minus the 3 tablespoons) until creamy and smooth. Then add the
Group A paste and

Add GROUP B

Now, put this mixture over, around, and in the leg of lamb. Use a
glass pan and cover with plastic film. Refridgerate for 24 hours.
Glass is used to avoid the possible chemical changes in the yogurt.
24 Hours later: Heat 6 tablespoons of vegetable oil in pan  and add
(when hot but not smoking)

GROUP C A few seconds in hot oil and you pour the spices and hot oil
over the lamb. Cover it all with foil and bake at 400F for 1 1/2
hours then uncover for
45    minutes.

Decorate with whole almonds and golden raisins. Then give it a final 5
minutes to finish in the oven.

I did a flower with the almonds as petals and raisins for the center.
Then arranged two rows of each down the sides.
