Title: HOW TO MAKE "PULLED" BAR-B-QUE\BUTEL
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings  This is how to prepare your meat for delicious pulled bar-b-que. Beef
brisket, beef round roasts and pork shoulders and butts may be used If
cooking the meat in the oven, prehaet to 325. Sprinkle meat with salt
and pepper to taste. Place in a heavy pot. If you intend to go
"stovetop" add 1/2 cup water to the pot and cover tightly with BOTH
foil and a lid. Check meat periodically and add more water as needed.
If cooking in the oven, DO NOT ADD WATER, just seal and place in the
oven. For either method, cook approximately 1 hour per pound, or
until fork tender and falling apart. When meat is done, remove and
allow to cool. Trim any excess fat. For full pulled meat, pull meat
into shreds with your hands or two forks. For partially pulled meat,
pull into 1-inch chunks. Return the shredded meat to the pot and add
your favorite sauce, allowing 1/2 cup per pound. Cook uncovered over
low heat. Submitted By SALLI SCHWARTZ (HONN)
