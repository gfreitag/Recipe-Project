Title: HULBA (FENUGREEK PASTE)
Categories: Yemani, Condiments
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Ground hulba (fenugreek)
1 c  -Cold water
2    Hot chilis (more if desired)
Salt
1    Tomato; peeled and chopped
1/4 c  Chopped onion
-OR- spring onion
2    Garlic cloves; crushed
1/4 ts Hawayij
1 c  Finely chopped boiled lamb
-OR- chicken
1 c  Boiled lentils
1 tb Chopped coriander leaves
2 tb Clarified butter or oil
1    Bone (or chicken stock)
Place fenugreek in a bowl and add cold water.  Leave to soak for 5
hours. Pour off water and beat until frothy with a fork.

Remove stalks and seeds from chilis and chop finely (take care in
handling them).  Blend into fenugreek paste with salt to taste and
place in a pot. This is the actual Hulba.

Add remaining ingredients except the stock or substitute some of the
ingredients with whatever is on hand, e.g. diced boiled potatoes for
rice, cooked dried beans for lentils. (For 1 cup cooked lentils,
simmer 1/2 cup red lentils in 1-1/2 cups water for 15-20 minutes
until thick.)

Blend ingredients in pot and add enough stock to moisten. Place over
medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until bubbling and
thick. Add a little more stock during heating if necessary.

Adjust seasoning with salt and serve in a deep bowl with khobz,
malvj, or the readily available Lebanese flat bread for scooping up
the mixture. Serve in individual bowls if preferred.
