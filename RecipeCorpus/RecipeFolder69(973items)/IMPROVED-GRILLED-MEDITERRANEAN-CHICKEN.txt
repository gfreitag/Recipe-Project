Yield: 12 Servings
:
8    scallions -- thinly sliced

:
8    cloves garlic -- finely

:
4 TB fennel seeds -- toast and

:
2 TB fresh ginger root
2 TB hot Hungarian paprika
2 ts cayenne
2 ts cumin
1 ts saffron threads -- or less
finely chopped
:
1 ts salt
1 c  water
1/2 c  fresh lemon juice
2 TB extra virgin olive oil
12    4 oz chicken breast halves,
bone-in, skin removed
:

Serve 1 breast per person with tzaziki sauce, couscous and grilled
bell pepper strips. TZAKIKI SAUCE, a Greek sauce made with yogurt,
cucumbers and garlic. This recipe works equally well when cut in half
to serve 6.

Mix all ingredients, except chicken, in a nonmetallic bowl. Add
chicken to the marinade; toss gently to coat pieces well. Cover and
refrigerate for 1 to 2 days. Prepare a barbecue grill so coals are
white-hot. Spray grill with nonstick coating. Remove chicken pieces
from marinade and place on grill. Cook, turning chicken frequently so
it does not burn, until juices run clear when large part of breast
halves are pierced. Cooking time will vary between 12 and 20 minutes,
depending on the heat of grill and the thickness of the breasts.
