Recipe by: Piers Thompson <pjt1@SCIGEN.CO.UK> If you are using dried
chiles then soak them in hot water for 20 minutes. Roughly chop the
garlic, onion and chiles. Peel and chop the ginger and pl in a
liquidiser (you could probably use a food processor - I haven't
tried) the garlic, onion, chiles, oil and shrimp paste. Blend until a
fine paste adding a little water if necessary (avoid the fumes!).
Cut the beef into f slices about 1/8 inch thick, 1 inch long and 1/2
inch wide.

Heat a non-stick frying pan and add the paste.  Fry for 3 minutes and
then the beef.  Fry until the meat is browned all over. Add half the
lemon juic the soy sauce, sugar and water. Stir, reduce the heat and
simmer for 20-30 minutes until the beef is tender. Taste and add
extra lemon juice if requi Add more water if necessary during
cooking. The sauce should be quite thic when the meat is cooked.

Serve with rice or noodles and quick fried cabbage with eggs (see
recipe).

Notes:  Vary the number of chiles depending on what sort of chile you
are u and how hot you like it.  It is supposed to be very hot. I have
also made using left over roast beef and reducing the simmering time
to 10 minutes.
