Title: HUMMUS (MANTON)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Mashed/pureed chickpeas
(+/-)
2 tb Tahini (optional, sort of)
4    To 5 cloves crushed/chopped
Garlic
x  Lemon juice to taste
(depending on how sour you
Like it)
Everyone has their own preference for the particular formula of
tahini/garlic/lemonjuice...you'll have to experiment to find your
perfect blend.

Mash/blend everything all up together, then scoop up/eat with strips
of fresh pita bread, celery, green pepper, carrot, zucchini,
whathaveyou.

You *can* make it without the tahini, but it doesn't taste nearly as
good. you can keep the tahini down to a minimum, and add extra garlic
and lemon juice for flavor...you can also put the tahini in a cup to
sit for awhile, until the oil separates and floats to the top. you
can then skim off the oil and use the remaining nut butter in the
recipe. it will still contain some oil and fat, but not as much. you
may need to mix a little water or lemon juice into the tahini to
liquify it a bit before mixing it into the chickpea mash.
