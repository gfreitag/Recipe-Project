Title: INDIVIDUAL PECAN PIES
Categories: Desserts, Pies, Cakes
Yield: 6 Pies
6 oz Plain flour
5 oz Melted butter
1 tb Icing (confectioners) sugar
1 tb Water
3 1/2 oz Pecan nuts (broken large)
2    Eggs (size 3/medium)
2 oz Dark brown soft sugar
5 oz Golden syrup (corn syrup)
Mix together the flour, icing sugar, water and 4 oz of the melted
butter. (You should kneed together for a good mix).

Divide between 6 x 4 inch flan tins or small bun tins and press up the
edges (prick lightly with a fork to reduce the amount the centre
rises)

Place on a baking tray and blind bake in a preheated oven at
190C/375F/gas mark 5 for 10 to 15 mins (until golden brown)

Remove and divide the chopped pecans between the pastry cases.

Whisk the eggs, then stir in the sugar, syrup and remaining 1 oz
melted butter. Beat well and spoon into the pastry cases, filling
almost to the top. (this makes probably 50% TOO much mixture for me)

Return to the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until set and golden.

Serve hot or cold with cream, creme fraishe or ice cream.

Time: about an hour and a quarter for one batch. Source: Sainsbury's
