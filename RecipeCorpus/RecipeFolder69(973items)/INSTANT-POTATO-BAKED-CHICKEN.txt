Recipe by: BOBBIE MIKES <bobbie.mikes@MOONDOG.COM> Mix cheese,
potato, salt and pepper in a bowl.  Dry chicken and dip in beaten
eggs. Slightly drain and coat thickly with the cheese and potato
mixture. Melt butter and oil in a glass dish that will not crowd the
chicken. Place chicken, meat side down, in dish.  Cook in a 375
degree oven for 17 minutes, turn chicken and cook an additional 17
minutes or until golden brown. Don't overcook.

Recipe servings may be doubled or tripled, just adjust Ingredients. If
using dark meat chicken pieces, increase cooking time to 20 minutes
each side.  Left over dry mixture may be saved in a covered jar in
the cupboard and reused later on pork chops or potatoes. Excellent on
both.
