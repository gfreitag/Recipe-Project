Categories: Potatoes, Soups & ste
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 lb Baking potatoes
1/4 lb Butter
2 c  Yellow onion  -- diced
1/3 c  Flour
5 c  Water
1/4 c  Low sodium chicken base
1 c  Instant potato flakes
3/4 ts Dried basil
1/2 ts Tabasco sauce
1 c  Heavy cream
1 c  Milk
Salt  -- to taste
White pepper  -- to taste
Preheat oven to 4000. Prick washed potatoes & bake until a fork
pierces to the center easily. Remove potatoes from oven & allow to
fully cool. Remove skin & cut potatoes into 1/2" cubes. Set aside.
Melt butter in a large saucepan.  Add onions & saute over low heat
for 10 minutes or until onions are translucent.  Don't allow onions
to burn. Add flour to onions & butter and cook 4 - 5 minutes,
stirring well until flour is absorbed. In a separate container,
combine water, chicken base, potato flakes & seasonings.  Stir or
whisk thoroughly to eliminate lumps. Add slowly to onion mixture,
stirring constantly so no lumps form. Increase to medium heat &
continue cooking until the soup begins to gently simmer. Add milk &
cream, stirring until smooth & lightly thickened. Simmer for 15
minutes. Do not boil.  Soup should just simmer lightly. Add cubed
baked potatoes & stir to combine. Remove from heat & serve. Top each
serving with grated cheddar cheese, sliced scallions & bacon pieces.
