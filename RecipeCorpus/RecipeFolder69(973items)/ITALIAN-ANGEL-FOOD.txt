Note just above recipe says this is light as angel food cake but
doesn't have all the sugar and is a good ending to any Italian
dinner. Slice it thin and use as a basis for strawberry shortcake if
you want or serve it plain alongside some fruit and cheeses.
1.  Process according to manufacturer's instructions for basic
bread.
2.  Turn out immediately onto a rack to cool.  Wrap in foil to
store.
