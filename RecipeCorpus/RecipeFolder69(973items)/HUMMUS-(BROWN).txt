Title: HUMMUS (BROWN)
Categories: Appetizers, Snacks
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Chick peas, soaked
5 tb Tahini
4 tb Lemon juice, or to taste
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
3    Garlic cloves, minced
1/4 ts Spanish paprika (hot)
1/2 ts Salt
Black pepper
Drain & rinse chick peas.  Put them in a large pot with lots of fresh
water & boil for 60 minutes.  If the chick peas are old, then you may
have to boil them for longer. Cook until they are soft.

Drain thoroughly, reserving the liquid.  Grind to a fine powder. Add
150 ml of reserved stock & blend to a stiff paste. You may have to
add more stock. Add all the other ingredients & mix thoroughly.

Leave to stand at least 2 hours so that the flavours can marry. Add
more seasonings if you require, especially lemon juice & olive oil.
