boil, add the green beans and time about 5 minutes, or until tender.
Drain the beans and rinse with cold water until completely chilled.
Pat dry. 3. For the sauce, combine the chicken broth, lime juice, soy
sauce, brown sugar, turmeric and red pepper. Prepare the dissolved
cornstarch. 4. In a large skillet, preferably nonstick, heat 1
teaspoon oil over medium-high heat. Add half of the chicken strips
and stir-fry until golden and just cooked through. Remove from the
pan and add another teaspoon of oil. Stir-fry the remaining chicken.
Remove from the pan. 5. Heat the remaining teaspoon oil. Add the
onion and red bell pepper; stir-fry 2 minutes. Add the garlic and
ginger; stir-fry 1 minute.  Add the sauce mixture and bring to a
boil. Stir in the dissolved cornstarch and boil until lightly
thickened. Add the beans and chicken; cook 2 minutes. 6. With a
slotted spoon, spoon the chicken and vegetables over the cooked rice.
Bring the sauce back to a boil and boil until thickened.  Pour over
