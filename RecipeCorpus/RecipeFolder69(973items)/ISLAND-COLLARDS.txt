Collard greens, a plentiful winter vegetable, are a wonderful source
of calcium and iron. They're best and healthiest when eaten slightly
crunchy, so be sure not to overcook them.

1. Stack 4-6 collard leaves and roll them up diagonally. Thinly slice
the leaves crosswise. Reserve.

2. Place bacon in a large, heavy pot over low heat and cook for 5
minutes, stirring, to render fat. Add garlic to the bacon and cook
for 2 minutes, stirring. Do not brown.

3. Add collard greens, in batches if necessary, until they all fit.
Combine ingredients well; season with salt and pepper.

4. Drizzle greens with chicken broth. Cover pot and cook over
medium-low heat for 10-12 minutes, stirring ocaasionally, until just
tender but still slightly crunchy. Serve hot.
