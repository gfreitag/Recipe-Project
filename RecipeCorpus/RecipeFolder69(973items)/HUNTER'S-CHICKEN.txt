Title: HUNTER'S CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Chicken, cut into serving
-size pieces (I use skinned
-chicken breasts)
2 tb Olive oil
2    To 4 cloves garlic, minced
2 ts Fresh rosemary
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  White wine vinegar
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/4    To 1/2 lb. mushrooms, sliced
1 cn Artichoke hearts, drained
-and halved (if large)
Heat oil in deep frying pan. Fry garlic until golden, then remove
from pan. Add chicekn, rosemary and salt and brown chicken, turning
until deep brown. Add wine vinegar and quickly cover pan until the
sizzling stops. Add wine and cook on high heat until it evaporates.
Reduce heat and simmer about 15 minutes. Add the sliced mushrooms and
artichoke hears. Cook until the chicken and mushrooms are tender.
Remove chicken to platter. Add about a tbsp of water to the juices in
the pan, turn up the heat and with a wooden spoon scrape clean the
sides and bottom to get all the bits that are there. The sauce will
turn amber. Pour over chicken and serve with good Italian bread.
