Title: HYPOCRASSE (SPICED WINE)
Categories: Beverages, Alcohol, Desert
Yield: 10 Servings
1    Liter dry red wine
60 g  Cinnamon
60 g  Ground ginger
10 g  Ground cardamom
10 g  Ground nutmeg
10    Whole cloves
50 cl Rose water (optional)
100 g  Sugar (up to 200)
Easy process: (more waste) Pour the wine and spices in a large
container. Wait 3 to 5 hours. Filter with a piece of old teeshirt.
Filter again if desired with coffee filter. Add sugar and adjust to
taste. Pour back in bottles or drink. Will keep at room temprature
for about 2 weeks.

Long process: (recommended) Pour wine into large container. Put
spices in a finely woven tight towel and tie shut making sure the
wine will flow thru the spices and be permeated. Let the spice bag
sit in the wine for 2 to 3 days, stirring occasionaly.  Filter as
above and add sugar. This method results in more yield because the
spices wont turn into a slime blob at the bottom and use so much
liquid.
