Categories: Breads, Hungarian
Yield: 2 Servings
1 pk Dry yeast
1 ts Sugar
2/3 c  Warm water
1 c  Butter, at room temperature
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Grated lemon peel
1/4 c  Nonfat dry milk
2 1/2    To 3-1/2 cups unbleached
-flour
1 c  Ground poppy seeds
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Milk
GLAZE:
1    Egg beaten with 1 tsp wat
In a small cup, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water. Let stand
for a few minutes.  Meanwhile, combine the butter, sugar, salt, 1
tbsp lemon peel, and milk in a large mixing bowl. Then add 2-1/2 cups
of flour alternately with the yeast mixture.  Blend the dough well.
Turn the dough out onto a floured board. Knead for about 10 minutes
until the dough is smooth and not sticky. Add more flour as
necessary. Put the dough into a greased bowl, turning so the top is
greased. Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk,
about 1 hour. While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Combine
the poppy seeds, sugar,raisins, milk, and the rest of the lemon peel
in the top half of a double boiler. Cook it over hot water until the
mixture is of spreading consistency. Stir constantly. It should
thicken in about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room
temperature.  Punch the dough down,divide in half, and roll each
piece into a long rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the filling
on top of each piece, then roll up. Pinch the seams together so the
filling can't come out.  Place the rolls on a large greased baking
sheet and brush with the glaze.  Cover the rolls with wax paper laid
across water glasses so the paper doesn't touch the dough.  Let rise
again for 30 minutes. Apply a second coat of glaze. Bake the loaves
in a preheated 325 F oven for about an hour.  If the top browns too
rapidly, cover loosely with aluminum foil. Cool on a wire rack. Makes
2 loaves.
