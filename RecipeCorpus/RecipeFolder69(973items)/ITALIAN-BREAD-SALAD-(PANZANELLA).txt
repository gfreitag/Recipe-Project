Title: ITALIAN BREAD SALAD (PANZANELLA)
Categories: Digest, August
Yield: 1 Servings
x  1 hard baugette
x  Ripe, juicy tomatoes
x  Minced onions or scallions
(red onions look nice)
x  Capers
x  Minced bell peppers
x  Minced fresh garlic
x  Minced fresh basil and
Parsley
x  Salt, red wine vinegar and
Freshly cracked pepper
If using a very hard baugette, run it under some water and then
crumble it into a bowl.  Alternatively you can cube the bread or
lightly toast it if it's fresh and then cut into cubes. Add the
remaining ingredients to taste.

The bread should make up about 3/4 of the salad.  The consistency is
comparable to potato or rice salad. Everything is moist and clinging
together but it isn't soupy nor is it dry.

Ripe, juicy homegrown tomatoes (this provides most of the moisture in
the dish, some of which used to come from olive oil)

I think this tastes best at room temperature.
