Title: HYDE PARK FUDGE CAKE
Categories: Chocolate, Cakes
Yield: 6 Servings
5 1/3 oz Bitter chocolate (bakery
-uses Guittard brand)
2/3 c  Shortening
2 2/3    Eggs (this is right -- comes
-from conversion of recipe)*
1 1/3 c  Water
3/4 c  Sour milk
1 1/3 ts Vanilla
3 c  Flour
2 3/4 c  Sugar
1 1/3 ts Baking soda
1 1/3 ts Salt
Icing:
3/4 c  Sugar
6 tb Evaporated milk
3 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
1 1/2 ts Butter
*Whether home cooks throw in that extra 1/3 egg is up to them, but
baker and Rio Grande store manager Janine Gwaltney believes it makes a
difference.  "Too much egg and the cake falls in the center," she
says.

Grease a Bundt pan.  Dust with fine bread crumbs and chill.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Melt the chocolate with the shortening.

Combine eggs, water, milk, and vanilla.  Blend well. Mix flour, sugar,
soda, and salt thoroughly. (If you don't, the flour will clump in the
batter.) Gradually add dry ingredients to liquid ingredients,
blending on low speed of mixer until just mixed, scraping bowl well.
Pour into pan and bake until done, 50-65 minutes. Cool in the pan 30
minutes. Turn out on a cake rack and glaze with icing.

Icing:  While cake is cooling, heat the sugar in the evaporated milk
in the top of a double boiler until the sugar is dissolved. (The
mixture will not feel grainy when rubbed between the fingers.) Melt
butter and chocolate together.  Combine with chocolate mixture. You
may add one to two tsp hot water to the icing to enhance the sheen.
Pour icing over the cake.
