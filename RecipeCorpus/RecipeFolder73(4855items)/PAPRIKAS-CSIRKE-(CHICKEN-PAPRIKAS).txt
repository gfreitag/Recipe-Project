Title: PAPRIKAS CSIRKE (CHICKEN PAPRIKAS)
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
1 lg Spanish onion finely chopped
A tad of oil or shortening
3 lb Cut up chicken
2-4 tablespoons Hungarian
-Paprika *
1 sm Container sour cream
Directions: In a pot or pan large enough to hold the chicken
comfortably, saute the chopped onion in a small quantity of
shortening until onion is glassy in appearance. Add paprika to taste
and color (I use about 4 tablespoons).  Add chicken.  Salt to taste -
about 1-2 teaspoons. Cover and simmer over slow flame until chicken
is ready to fall off the bone. If the juice released from the onion
seems not to be enough, and the chicken is in danger of burning, add
a touch of water - but try to cook slowly enough so that you do not
have to add water. When the chicken is tender, remove from pan with a
slotted spoon and set aside. Pour onions and juices into a blender
and blend until smooth. If you are a stickler for tradition, put mix
through sieve instead. Pour back into pan. Stir in 1/2 to whole
container of sour cream (to taste), stirring well. Bring to light
boil, and return chicken to pan, and let simmer for about 10 minutes.
Serve with noodles, spatzle (traditional) or rice. Chicken Paprikas -
