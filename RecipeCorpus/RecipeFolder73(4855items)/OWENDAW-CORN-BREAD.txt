Title: OWENDAW CORN BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Cooked hominy
2 tb Butter
2    Eggs
1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Cornmeal
1/2 ts Salt
Hominy gives this bread it's distinctive flavor. Like all spoon
breads, it should be eaten very hot with plenty of butter. Do try
this one it will change your mind about grits.

This recipe orignally appeared in The Carolina Housewife. The last
line in the recipe is taken verbatim from the orignal by the authors.

While hominy is hot, stir in the butter. Beat eggs until light and
add to hominy, then add milk. Stir in cornmeal and salt. This makes a
very thin batter. Pour into a deep, buttered pan and bake in a 375
degree F. oven for about 30 minutes (about 1 hour in a glass baking
dish). This will serve 6.

When baked, it has the appearance of a baked batter pudding, and when
rich and well mixed it has almost the delicacy of baked custard.
