Categories: Swedish, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Steak; top round
Salt & fresh ground pepper
4 tb Butter
4 tb Vegetable oil
1 c  Onions; finely chopped
2 tb Flour
16    Flat anchovy fillets; washed
-and dried
1/2 c  Water
Cut the meat into 8 slices of 6x3 inches each and pound them to 1/8"
thick, between 2 pieces of wax paper with a meat pounder, the flat of
a cleaver or bottom of a pot. Trim to the above size. Heat 1
tablespoon of butter with 2 tablespoons oil in a small skillet and
saut the onions for 5 to 8 minutes or until tender and golden.
Remove from heat and stir in flour. Return to heat and cook 1 or 2
minutes. Reserve 2 tablespoons of this roux for the sauce. Sprinkle
each slice of meat with salt and pepper and spread the remaining roux
evening over the meat. Lay 2 anchovy fillets on each slice, roll them
up securely and either tie with a loop of cord at each end or fasten
with a wooden toothpick inserted through the roll lengthwise. Heat
the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil in a
heavy 10-12" saut pan over moderate heat. When the foam subsides,
add the roulades, 4 at a time. Turn them with kitchen tongs to brown
on all sides. Arrange the browned roulades in a sinlge layer in a 2 -
2 1/2 quart casserole or baking dish that has a cover. The
preparation of the roulades may be done in advance up to this point.
Preheat the oven to 350øF. Deglaze the pan by pouring in 1/2 cup of
water and boiling for 1 or 2 minutes, stirring to scrape up any bits
clinging to the pan. Add the 2 tablespoons of roux that you kept
aside and cook over medium-high heat for 2 or 3 more minutes,
stirring briskly, until the sauce has thickened. Pour over the
roulades, cover and bake for 45 minutes. Serve the oxrulader with
mashed potatoes and gherkins or relish.
