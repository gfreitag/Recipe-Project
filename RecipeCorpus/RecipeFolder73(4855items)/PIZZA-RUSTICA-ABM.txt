Place all dough ingredients in pan and program for knead and first
rise. The dough will be firm and pull away from the side of the
machine. While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. In mixing
bowl, whisk together all the ingredients and refrigerate until you
are ready to assemble the pizza. Preheat the oven to 400øF. with the
rack in the center position. Grease a 9" springform pan.

When the dough cycle is completed transfer the dough to a lightly
floured work surface, cover it with a clean towel, and let it rest
for 5 minutes. Cut the dough in 2 pieces; one piece should be one
third of the dough and the other piece should be 2/3.  Roll out the
larger piece to a 14" circle. Line the springform pan with the
circle. A small amount of dough (1") should overlap the top of the
pan. Arrange 5 slices of salami on the bottom. Spread a third of the
ricotta filling over the salami, then sprinkle on a third of the
basil. Lay out a third of the peppers. Lay out 4 slices of provolone.
Repeat this pattern for the next 2 layers. Roll out the small piece
of dough to a 9" circle. Brush water around the rim of the dough
already in pan, then fit the 9" circle on top. Trim away about 1/2"
of the overlapping dough from the bottom circle. Crimp together the
top and bottom edges. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil and
salt and pepper. With a pair of scissors, cut a vent in the top crust
about 1" in diameter. Bake for 15 minutes at 400øF., then at 350øF.
for 15 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately remove
the sides of the springform. Cool before slicing to allow layers to
set.
