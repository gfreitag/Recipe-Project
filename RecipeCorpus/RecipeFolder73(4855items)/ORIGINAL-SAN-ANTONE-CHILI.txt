Chuck wagon cooks from around San Antone were mighty proud of their
chili and mighty set in their ways of puttin' peppers in and leavin'
beans out. But San Antone Chili sure stuck to your ribs, and even if
you liked beans, you didn't complain. At least not where the cook
could hear you. From "Famous Chili Recipes From Marlboro Country".
