Title: ORANGE CHIP COOKIES
Categories: Bakery, Cookies, Low-fat
Yield: 40 Cookies
3 c  White flour
1/2 c  Wheatgerm
2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Allspice
2/3 c  Unsweetened chocolate chips
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  White sugar
3/4 c  Orange juice
In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, salt & allspice.
Stir in the chocolate chips.  Add the rest of the ingredients in
order, beating well after each addition.

Lightly oil non-stick cookie sheets.  Drop the batter by the
teaspoonful onto the cookie sheets.  Bake 12 to 15 minutes until
lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.

NOTE: I've had wild variations with this recipe.  One batch cooked in
7 minutes, one batch did not cook until 20 minutes. It seems to have
settled down between 12 & 15 minutes as I changed some of the
ingredient amounts. I've also had anything from 33 to
45    cookies in a batch.
