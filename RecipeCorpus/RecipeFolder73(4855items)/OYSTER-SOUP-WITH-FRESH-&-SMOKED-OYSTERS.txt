Cook the bacon in a 3-quart pot over medium high heat until lightly
browned, about 4 minutes.

Add the onion and leek and cook until softened, about
4    minutes, stirring often.

Add the potato, cream, milk and clam juice and bring to boil. Simmer,
uncovered, until potato is just short of cooked, about 8 minutes.

The soup can be made ahead up to this point and refrigerated
overnight. Gently reheat if chilled.

Add the spinach and fresh and smoked oysters and cook just until fresh
oysters are cooked, about 1 minute.

Add additional clam juice if needed for consistency.

Season with salt and white pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
