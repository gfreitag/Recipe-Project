Title: PFEFFERNUESSE (GERMAN PEPPERNUTS)
Categories: Cookies, German
Yield: 25 Servings
3 1/2 c  Flour
2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Allspice
1/2 ts Cloves
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Mace
4 ea Eggs
2 c  Sugar
1 x  Grated peel of 1 lemon
1/2 c  Candied citron,fine chopped
1/2 c  Unblanched almonds, ground
3 tb Brandy
Stir together flour, cinnamon, basking powder, nutmeg, allspice,
cloves, salt, pepper and mace; set aside. In a large bowl beat eggs
at medium speed of mixer until fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar.
Continue beating 15 minutes longer or until thick and fluffy. Add
flour mixture in thirds, adding lemon peel, citron, and almonds to
last third and blending thoroughly after each addition. Turn half the
dough out onto lightly floured surface. Roll out 1/2 inch thick. Cut
with 1-inch round cutter (inside of doughnut cutter works well) and
place 1 inch apart on greased cookie sheets.
Reroll scraps. Let stand uncovered at room temperature overnight.
When ready to bake, turn cookies over so moist side is up; put drop
of brandy in center of each. Bake in preheated 300 degree F. oven 20
minutes or until cookies "pop" and are baked through. (Break one in
half; if not sticky, it's done.) Remove to racks to cool. Makes 90
cookies. NOTE cookies improve with age. Store in tightly covered
container. Add a piece of apple to container a few days before
serving to soften them. Per cookie: 48 cal, 1 g pro, 9 g car, 1 g
fat, 11 mg chol.
A drop of brandy on the top before baking causes them to "pop,"
giving them a characteristic topknot.
