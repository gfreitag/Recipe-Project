Title: PEANUT BRITTLE DELUXE
Categories: Candies, Christmas, Gifts
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Light Corn Syrup; Karo
1/4 c  Water
1 1/2 c  Salted Peanuts
4 tb Butter Or Regular Margarine
2 tb Baking Soda
1 ts Vanilla
Combine the sugar, corn syrup and water in a heavy 3-quart saucepan.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is
dissolved. (Note: Be very careful when you make this recipe as the
syrup is dangerous if spilled on you.)  Continue cooking, stirring
occasionally, until the mixture reaches the soft crack stage (285
degrees F.) on the candy thermometer.  Add the peanuts and butter.
Cook, stirring constantly, to the hard crack stage (300 degrees F.)
on the candy thermometer. Remove from the heat.  Rapidly stir in the
baking soda and vanilla. (Mixture will foam up.) Turn the mixture
onto 2 greased baking sheets (Jelly roll pans work nicely). Spread
out with a metal spatula as thin as possible. When the candy begins
to set, loosen from the baking sheets. Turn the brittle over, then
stretch and pull brittle as thin as possible using two forks. When
completely cooled, break into pieces.

Makes about 2 pounds of brittle.
