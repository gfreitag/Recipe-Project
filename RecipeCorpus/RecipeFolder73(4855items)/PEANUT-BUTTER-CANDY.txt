1 lb 10x sugar
2 c  Peanut Butter
1/2 lb Butter;softened
2 lb Milk Chocolate Coating
Mix all ingred's until smooth and soft, If sticky add more powdered
sugar. Make into small logs, egg shape. Melt chocolate coating. I use
electric fry pan with water on low, and I use a stainless steel bowl
to melt choc-coating. It gives me more room for dipping eggs. You can
also just put them in Reese's type molds, and papers. But we shape
them in Egg shape for Easter. Put on Wax paper lined cookie sheet and
put in freezer for a few minutes, makes them shiny and nice. PS. I
use the left over chocolate to make solid chocolate bunny-you can buy
all kinds of molds that are in expensive.

Or for my Jim add nuts and raisens, and put them in papers. They are
just like a chunky bar. Or just save it in a jar for next time. the
kids always like chocolate covered small pretzils. Use your
imagination. <G> Good Luck and Enjoy By Joni in S.Jersey
