Title: PART-BAKED ROLLS & LOAVES
Categories: Bread, Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Rolls
Both home-baked white and wheatmeal rolls can be frozen partly baked.
This is a very successful way of freezing rolls as the frozen rolls
can be put straight from the freezer into the oven to finish baking.
It is the best method of freezing rolls to serve for breakfast.
Loaves are not so successful as rolls because during part-baking the
crust becomes well formed and colored before the center of the loaf
is set. Part-baked loaves and rolls available in shops freeze well.

TO PART-BAKE ROLLS:

Place shaped and risen rolls in a slow oven, Gas No. 2 (300 degrees
F/150 degrees C), for about 20 minutes. The rolls must be set but
still pale in color. Cool.

TO FREEZE:

Pack cooled rolls in usable quantities in freezer bags. Seal and
freeze. As the sides of the rolls are still slightly soft, care must
be taken when packing to avoid squashing.

STORAGE TIME:

Up to 4 months.

TO THAW AND FINISH BAKING:

Unwrap and place frozen rolls in oven to thaw and complete baking.
Bake white rolls at Gas No. 6 (400 degrees F/200 degrees C), brown
rolls at Gas No. 8 (450 degrees F/230 degrees C) for 20 minutes.
Alternatively, to defrost the loaf in the microwave, stand uncovered
on paper towel and heat on defrost for 2 minutes, then leave for 5
minutes. Slice and leave for 1-2 minutes, until completely defrosted.
The remainder of the loaf can be refrozen.

TO FREEZE:

Freeze immediately after purchasing. Leave loaves in polythene bags in
which they were sold. Pack rolls in polythene bags and seal.

STORAGE TIME:

Up to 4 months.

Note: Many commercial part-baked rolls and bread can be stored at room
temperature. Follow instructions on the pack.
