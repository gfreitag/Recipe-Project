Hi all,  This was in the Parade section of last Sunday's paper by
Rossi & Lukins. Looks great and healthy. Remove tough stems from
spinach, Rinse well.
Soak & clean thoroughly. Shake off water and put in a pot with lid.
In a small bowl, combine orange juice, mustard & pepper. Whisk well.
Slowly drizzle in xtra v. olive oil., whisking well. Stir in 1 T.
chives; season with salt. Set dressing aside. Place the pure olive
oil in a large nonstick skillet.  Over medium heat, add half the
scallops. Cook 4 to 5 min, or until they are opaque and lightly
golden, shaking the pan and turning scallops once.  Proceed with the
second batch. Keep warm. While scallops are cooking, wilt the spinach
over medium heat about 3 min., covered, stirring once. When scallops
are finished, drain the spinach well and set in the center of a large
serving plate. Pull spinach apart a bit with 2 forks so it comes
close to the rim. Center scallops attractively atop the spinach.
Pour the orange dressing over all and garnish with remaining chives
and the orange zest. Serve immediately. Per serving: 202 calories,
