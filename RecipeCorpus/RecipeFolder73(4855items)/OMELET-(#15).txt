Title: OMELET (#15)
Categories: Egg, Woman's day
Yield: 1 Servings
2 ea Eggs
1/8 ts Salt
x  Freshly ground black pepper
1 tb Olive oil
1.  Heat the broiler.  In a small bowl, using a fork, lightly beat the
eggs, salt and pepper.

2.  In an 8-inch nonstick, oven-proof skillet, heat the oil over a
medium-high flame until hot (a drop of water will sizzle). Swirl the
pan to coat the bottom and sides in hot oil.

3.  Pour in the egg mixture.  Let it cook about 30 seconds. The edges
will puff and bubble slightly and just begin to set. Hold the skillet
handle with one hand, a wooden spoon with the other. Make "figure
eights" with the spoon, starting at twelve o'clock, then three
o'clock, etc., pushing the cooked edges toward the center and letting
the uncooked egg run to the sides.  Keep the eggs moving until the
bottom is set and the top is slightly moist.

4. Place the skillet under the broiler 30 seconds to 1 minute, until
the eggs are puffed and cooked to your liking. Slide half the omelet
onto a plate and invert the pan to fold over for the remaining half.
