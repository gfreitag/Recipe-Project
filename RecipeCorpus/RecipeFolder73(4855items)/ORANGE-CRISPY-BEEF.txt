* For tenderness and appearance, be sure to cut the beef strips
diagonally across the grain.

In a small bowl, toss beef strips with a sprinkling of salt. Stir in
beaten egg white.

In a medium bowl, prepare batter by combining flour, cornstarch and
baking powder. Mix egg yolk with half of the water and add. Whisk in
additional water until a smooth, runny batter develops. Heat oil to
325. Dip beef strips in batter. Carefully place strips in hot oil and
fry for about a minute or until batter is set. Drain and set aside.
Keep oil hot. In another wok, heat a tablespoon of oil. Combine and
add ginger, garlic, orange zest, mandarin zest and scallions. Stir
fry for about 30 seconds. Combine and add chili sauce, wine, chicken
broth, soy sauce, and sugar.

Stir until thick and shiny. Keep warm.

Re-fry beef strips. Drain. Quickly stir into thickened orange sauce.
Serve hot with bowls of steamed rice. Serves 4.
