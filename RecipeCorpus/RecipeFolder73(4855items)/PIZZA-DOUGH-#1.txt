Title: PIZZA DOUGH #1
Categories: Breads, Ethnic
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
3/4 c  Warm water
1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Olive or vegetable oil
2 c  All-purpose flour
Dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Stir in sugar, salt, oil and one
and 3/4 cups of the flour.  Turn onto a well-floured board and knead
until smooth and elastic. This should take about five minutes. Knead
in enough of the remaining flour to prevent sticking.
