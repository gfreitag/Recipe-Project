Categories: Crafts, Holidays, Kids
Yield: 1 Recipe
MMMMM---------------------LISA CRAWLEY/TSPN--------------------------
2 c  All Purpose Flour
2 c  Water
1 c  Salt
2 tb Cream of Tartar
Food Coloring
6 Loops of String or Wire
Plastic Bags
1. Dough- In a medium saucepan, mix together the flour, water, salt,
and cream of tartar. 2. Heat on medium heat and stir constantly until
the mixture is thick and satiny. 3. Let cool to room temperature. 4.
Divide dough into two parts and place into two plastic bags.

COLORING DOUGH 1.) You decide what food coloring you want to add. Put
about ten drops of food coloring into each bag. Then squeeze the
dough inside the bag until it is evenly colored. You can add more
food coloring, two drops at a time, until the color is as deep as you
want.

2.) OR leave the dough uncolored, and later you can paint the finished
ornaments with tempera or watercolor paints.

SHAPING 1). Mold into shapes with your hands. 2.) OR flatten the
dough, and cut out the shapes with cookie cutters. 3.) Either way, be
sure to mold the dough around a looped string or wire so that you
will be able to hang the finished ornament.

FINISHING ORNAMENTS 1. Let the dough ornaments dry thoroughly, 24
hours or so. If the weather is damp and the ornaments aren't drying
properly, then you may want to dry them in the oven. In that case,
dry the ornaments at 200 F for 30 minutes. 2.) Paint the ornaments
with tempera or water colors. (Even if you colored the dough, you may
want to paint in details.) 3.) If you plan on keeping the ornaments
for more than a few weeks, finish by brushing them with clear shellac.
