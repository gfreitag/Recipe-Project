Title: PASTA CON PESTO ALLA MELONE
Categories: Appetizers, Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Fresh Grated Parmesan Cheese
2 c  Fresh Basil Leaves
1/2 c  Melted Butter
1/2 ea Cloves Fresh Garlic
1 tb Pine Nuts
3/4 c  Olive Oil
Pasta Capellini/Vermicelli
Using blender or food processor, grate enough Parmesan chees to make
one cup; add basil. The add melted butter, followed by garlic, pine
nuts and finally the oil. Allow each ingredient to blend smoothly
with the preceding ones, then let stand 1 hour. This is the Pesto
Sauce.

Prepare pasta according to package directions. Mix pesto with pasta
fresh from the boiling water. Do not add too much pesto, but allow
each person a chance to adjust flavor by taste, by adding more pesto
if desired. Leftover pesto will last for a long time if refrigerated
in a plastic container, but do not freeze.

A light salad with oil and vinegar dressing and a veal dish go great
with this. Pasta Con Pesto is also a versatile accompaniment to a
variety of dishes-meat, fish, poultry, etc.
