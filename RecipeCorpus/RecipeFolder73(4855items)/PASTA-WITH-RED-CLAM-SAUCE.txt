As soon as the liquid comes to a boil, add the clams and cover the
pan. Steam the clams until all of them have opened, 3 to 5 minutes;
discard any unopened clams. With a slotted spoon, remove them from
the pan and keep them warm in a covered bowl.

Stir in the remaining ingredients, except the black pepper, into the
liquid in the pan. As soon as the liquid returns to a simmer, place
the clams, shells and all, on top of pasta and spoon the liquid over
them. Season to taste with black pepper.
