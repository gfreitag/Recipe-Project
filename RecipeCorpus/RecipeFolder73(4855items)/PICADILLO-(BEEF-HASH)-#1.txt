excess fat. 2. Add the sherry, tomatoes, salt, Worcestershire and
Tabasco, stir, and cook, uncovered, over medium heat for 15 to 20
minutes. 3. Heat the vegetable oil in a small skillet over
medium-high heat until fragrant, then fry the chopped potato until

over medium- high heat, unpeeled and halved, in salted water to cover
until tender, 20 minutes, and omit the vegetable oil.) Add the
potato, raisins, and olives to the meat, correct the seasonings, and
continue cooking until most of the liquid is absorbed, 10 to 15
minutes. 4. Transfer the picadillo to a large bowl or platter, place
the chopped egg in the center, outline the border with peas, and
sprinkle the entire dish with the pimiento. Makes 4 to 6 servings
