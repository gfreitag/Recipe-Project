25 ea Cream filled chocolate sand-
1 x  Wich cookies
3 c  Flour
1 1/4 c  Milk
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Butter flavored Crisco
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
4 ea Lg. eggs
MMMMM----------------------CHOCOLATE GLAZE---------------------------
6 oz Pkg semi sweet chocolat bits
3 tb Butter flavored Crisco
1 tb Milk
1 tb Corn syrup
Preheat oven to 350. Grease and flour 9" tube pan. Cut each sandwich
cookie into quarters. In large bowl, with mixer at low speed, beat
flour and remaining ingredients (except cookies and glaze) until
blended. Increase speed to high; beat 2 minutes, scraping bowl a few
times. Spoon about 3/4 cup batter into pan. Gently stir cut up
cookies into remaining batter and spoon into same pan. For fun, I put
in four or five uncut cookies, so people have fun guessing which
slice will have a "whole" cookie. Bake 50 minutes or till cake
springs back whe lightly touched. Toothpick test will not work. Cool
cake in pan on wire rack ten minutes; remove from pan; cool
completely on rack. When cake is cool, prepare chocolate glaze.
CHOCOLATE GLAZE: In 1 qt. saucepan over low heat, heat chocolate
bits, Crisco, milk and corn syrup stirring constantly until melted
and smooth. This freezes well too and can easily be made in mini loaf
pans as well.
