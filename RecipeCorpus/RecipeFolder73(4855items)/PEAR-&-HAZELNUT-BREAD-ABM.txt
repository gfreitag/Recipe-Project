Title: PEAR & HAZELNUT BREAD ABM
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Ounces
MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
1 1/2 lg Pears
3 tb Oil
1/2 tb Yeast
2 c  Bread flour
1 1/8 c  Rye flour
3 tb Wheat germ
3 tb Sugar
1/2 tb Salt
1/2 tb Fennel seeds
3 tb Hazelnuts, chopped
1/2 c  Water; warm
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start. In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Ripe, actually overripe, pears make the sweetest, moistest bread. This
subtly flavored loaf does fine on its own and makes excellent plain,
cinnamon, or French toast. Or place a thin slice of cold cooked lamb
on it and briefly warm in the broiler.
