Title: PAGODA FRUIT CRISP
Categories: Desserts, Fruits, Chinese
Yield: 2 Servings
Wonton wrappers
Cream, whipped
Fruit, seasonal, sectioned
-- skinned, and depitted
Fry the wonton skins in the least amount of peanut oil possible.
When done, drain and set aside between paper towels to dry.

Put on skin on the serving plate, and layer seasonal fruits onto
it in any pleasant design you can manage. Add spots of whipping cream
into the design and then put another fried skin onto the fruit but
with its corners offset from that of the first layer.

To achieve a "pagoda" effect make sure the second layer skin is
slightly smaller than that first layer. Also try not to put the fruit
on to cover the entire skin. Leave about a half inch of the edges
clean.

Cover the second layer with fruit and whipped cream and garnish and
serve.
