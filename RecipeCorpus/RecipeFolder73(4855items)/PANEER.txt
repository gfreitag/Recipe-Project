Title: PANEER
Categories: Indian, Cheese
Yield: 1 Piece
5 c  Whole milk
2 1/2 tb Lemon juice
Bring the milk to a boil. As soon as it begins to bubble, pour in the
lemon juice, stir once, and take the pot off the heat. Leave it for
15 minutes. The milk will curdle and the curds will separate from the
whey.

Strain the curds through three layers of cheesecloth. Squeeze out as
much whey as you can easily.  (Do not discard this whey. Refrigerate
it and use it in cooking instead of water.) Tie up the curds in the
cheesecloth, and hang the bundle to drip overnight.

Next morning, remove the hanging bundle and untie it. Gently flatten
it out to make a 4-inch patty, keeping the cheese loosely wrapped in
the cheesecloth.  Put the patty on a sturdy plate and place a flat,
heavy object, such as a heavy pot filled with water, on top of it.
Leave the weight on the cheese for 4 to 5 hours. After the cheese has
been pressed, it should be 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick.

Remove the cheese from the cheesecloth and, with a sharp knife, cut
into cubes, diamonds, or rectangles. The paneer will be quite crumbly
until fried.
