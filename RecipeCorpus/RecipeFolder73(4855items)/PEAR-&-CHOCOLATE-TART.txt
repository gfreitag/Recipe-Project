Title: PEAR & CHOCOLATE TART
Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  All purpose flour
1 1/2    Stick of butter, unsalted,
-cut into 1 inch slices
1    Egg
1 pn Of salt
1/2    Egg shell of water
Pastry:

Process butter and flour until crumbly.  Add egg and water, process
until a ball forms, remove from processor, wrap in cling film,
refrigerate 20 minutes. Cook the tart shell and cool. (He says
nothing of how long or what temperature!)

Tart:

5 pears, peeled, halved, cored, and poached in a simple syrup (2 c
water, 2 c sugar, 1 Tbsp vanilla) 6 oz semisweet chocolate 2 oz
butter 1 large jar apricot preserves 2 Tbsp grand Marnier

Poach pears in liquid until soft, about 30-40 minutes. Test for
doneness with a knife - if there is little resistance, pears are
done. Remove from liquid and cool

Melt the butter and chocolate over low heat, then pour into tart
shell. Halve the pears and make vertical cuts from the bottoms almost
up to the stem ends, spread out cut parts like a fan, and arrange in
the chocolate. Allow the chocolate to set.  Bring the apricot
preserves to a boil with the Grand Marnier, then brush very liberally
over the pears. Cool and serve. If this is made in advance and
refrigerated, take out and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
