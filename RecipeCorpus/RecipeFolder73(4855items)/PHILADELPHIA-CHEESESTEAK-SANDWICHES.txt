The key to authentic Philly cheesesteaks is the bread. If you can
find a good Italian bakery to give you good Italian bread, you're
almost all the way there. For best results, use a griddle that covers
two stove burners, or an electric griddle of similar size. Also, two
identical griddle spatulas will make things easier.

Preheat the griddle (or light both burners).

On one side of the griddle, heat all the beef, chopping the beef
finely until all the slices (or sheets, or whatever) have formed a
large pile of small bits. Keep the beef moving as you cook the onion,
followed by the peppers, on the other side of the griddle. When
everything is fully cooked, combine everything and mix thoroughly,
finally dividing the mixture into 4 columns on the griddle, keeping
each column as separate as possible. Cover the columns with two
slices each of provolone, mist with water to melt the cheese, and
cover, if possible.  When cheese has melted, cover the column with
the Italian Roll, which will give you a completed, but upside-down,
sandwich. Just scoop them up with the spatula. Walt MM Larry Miller
