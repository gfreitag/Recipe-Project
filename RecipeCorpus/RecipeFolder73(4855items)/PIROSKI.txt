Title: PIROSKI
Categories: Appetizers, Greek
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM-------------------------THE CRUST------------------------------
1/3 c  Milk
3 pk Granular yeast
4 c  Flour
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
4 ea Egg yolks
1 ts Salt
Oil for frying
MMMMM------------------------THE FILLING-----------------------------
1 lb Chopped meat
2 tb Butter
1 sm Onion, chopped
1/2 c  Tomato sauce
4 tb Parmesan cheese, grated
1 ea Egg white, beaten with a>>>d
Few drops of water.
Parsley, chopped
Heat milk to lukewarm, pour into a bowl; add yeast. Mix with you
fingers.  Add a cup of the flour, and mix to form a ball. Cover the
bowl, and set in a warm place. Let the sponge rise until double in
bulk. Punch down.  Add vegetable oil, egg yolks, salt and remaining
flour, mix well, then knead to make a stiff dough. (Add more water or
flour, if necessary.) Cover and let rise again.

Meantime, brown the meat in butter.  Add onion, and cook until
light brown.  Mix in tomato sauce and parsley, and cook abt. 15 to 20
min. Stir in grated cheese.

Lightly flour a bread board and turn dough out onto it; knead until
elastic.  Divide  into small pcs. Flatten these with your hands, or
roll into thick round shapes. In the center of each, place a tbs. of
the meat mixture.  Fold over dough to form a half-moon shape. Brush
edges with a little egg white, and pinch to seal. Flatten the piroski
slightly and place on a buttered baking sheed. Set aside in warm
place to rise again, but for less time.  Deep-fat fry until a deep
golden color. Remove with slotted spoon, drain, and serve hot. Makes
about 15 to 18 piroski.

NOTE 1:  These can be baked instead of fried.  To bake follow the
directions above to the final rising, then brush tops with egg white,
and bake in preheated 350 F. oven until golden brown.

NOTE 2:  The filling can be of chicken, ham, fish, or hard-cooked
eggs.
For any of these, chop the filling and mix with Bechamel sauce, or
mashed potaotes.

NOTE 3:  You can also make sweet piroski by adding 3 tbs. sugar
when you add the salt.  Fill dough with marmalade and chopped glazed
fruit. Bake as in Note 1 above, and top with confectioner's sugar.
