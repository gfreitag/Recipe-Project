Simple, but a true conversation piece. The first time I ate them,
they were covered with red rose petals. Peel the apples and grate
into a clear glass bowl. Stir in the lemon juice to prevent
discoloration. Add sugar, rose water, and mix gently. Cover and
refrigerate 3-4 hours. To serve, top with finely crushed ice and
garnish with lemon. Serve immediately. Serves 6.
