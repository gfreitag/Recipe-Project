Strain the oyster liquor through a sieve lined with a double
thickness of rinsed and squeezed cheesecloth and set over a bowl and
reserve it. In a small heavy saucepan, cook the celery and the
scallion in the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until they
are softened; add the flour and cook the mixture over low heat,
stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the milk and the cream in a stream and
1/8 teaspoon of the salt, stirring, and simmer it gently, stirring,
for 5 minutes. In a saucepan, heat the oysters in the reserved liquor
over low heat for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the edges of the oysters
are curled and firm. Strain the milk mixture through a sieve into the
oyster mixture, stirring, and remove the pan from the heat. Stir in
the additional salt and divide the soup between 2 heated bowls.
Sprinkle the soup with the nutmeg and serve it with the toast points.
