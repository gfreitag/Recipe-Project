MMMMM----------------------SOURDOUGH BREAD---------------------------
4 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Grease
Starter:

Combine the three ingredients and let sit over night in a warm place.

Use of Starter:  Each time you use the starter, pour off 1/2 cup or
more to use in you next baking effort. Do not keep starter in a metal
container. A glass or potter container works best. The starter will
usually keep for several months in the refrigerator but frequent use
will renew the starter and keep it fresh. Never add anything to your
starter except plain flour and warm water.  Set starter the night
before use by adding flour and water (2 cups each).  Remove your
fresh cup of starter and use the bubbly batter in the bread recipe.

Bread:

Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl.  Pour in sponge and mix (also
grease).  Knead the dough for ten minutes, then allow to rise for
three to four hours. Disolve 1/4 teaspoon baking soda in 1 Tb. water
then knead into dough.  Allow to rise again.  Shape into loaves and
bake at 375 degress F. for 45 minutes.
