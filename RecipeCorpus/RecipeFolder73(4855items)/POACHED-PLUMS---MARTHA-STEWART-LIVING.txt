Title: POACHED PLUMS - MARTHA STEWART LIVING
Categories: Fruits, Desserts, Soup/stews
Yield: 6 Servings
2    Earl Grey tea bags
3/4 c  Sugar
Juice of 1 lemon
6    Plums
1. Bring 6 C of water to a boil in a large nonreactive saucepan. Add
tea bags, remove from heat, cover, and steep for about 10 minutes.
Remove tea bags and bring back to a boil. Add sugar and lemon juice
and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes.

2. Reduce heat to medium low so that liquid is barely simmering. Add
plums and poach until tender, 30 seconds to 1 minute. (If plums are
not very ripe, this will take longer.) Remove plums from liquid and
let cool. Reduce poaching liquid to the consistency of light syrup.
For an elegant presentation, Pull plum skin back from fruit, leaving
it attached at the stem end (this doesn't work on all plum
varieties). Serve plums with some of the poaching liquid.
