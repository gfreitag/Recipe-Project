Categories: Fish, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 c  Cream, heavy
1 lb Asparagus
6 oz Salmon, smoked
1    Lemon
3/4 lb Fettuccine
2 T  Butter
Salt and pepper
In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a boil and let simmer to
reduce to one cup.  Break off the ends of the asparagus, cut the
spears into pieces and cook in boiling salted water for about seven
minutes or until they are tender; drain. Cut the salmon into strips.
Grate one teaspoon of lemon zest and squeeze one teaspoon of juice
from the lemon.

Cook the pasta in boiling water about 12 minutes or till just done.
Return to the hot pot and toss with the reduced cream, asparagus,
smoked salmon, lemon zest and juice, and butter. Salt to taste and
plenty of fresh ground black pepper.  Serve immediately.

If using ricotta cheese and milk instead of the cream, do not reduce
it but mix only the amount the recipe calls for and heat.  PurÂ‚e the
ricotta in a blender and thin with a little milk.
