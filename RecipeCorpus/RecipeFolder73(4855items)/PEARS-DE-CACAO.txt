Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
11    Pear halves; canned or see
-my note following this
-recipe
3 tb Cocoa
1/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Whipping cream; whipped
1 ds Salt
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 ts Mint extract
1 ts Unflavored gelatin
1/3 c  Creme de Cacao
Drain the pears thoroughly on paper toweling. Combine the cocoa and
sugar in a mixer bowl, then blend into the cream. Add the salt,
vanilla and mint extracts. Soften the gelatin in 1 tablespoon of cold
water, then dissolve over hot water. Add the gelatin to the cream
mixture and stir until smooth. Chill until of spreading consistency.
Fill the cavities of the pears and spread the cut sides with the
chocolate mixture. Place 2 pear halves together to form whole pears,
then place in a shallow dish, chill for at least 1 hour. Arrange each
pear in a stemmed compote and spoon the Creme de Cacao over the
pears. Garnish with Chocolate Leaves and chill until ready to serve.
Note: These are great for a quick last minute dessert, and if you
have a bit more time, try using fresh pears which have been peeled
and poached until tender. For a special treat, inject the pears with
some of the Creme de Cacao, or Creme de Menthe.
