SHELL THE BEANS then put them in a pan with water to cover; add the
bay leaf, half the sage and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Slice 1 of
the garlic cloves and add it to the pan along with the carrot. Salt
lightly and simmer until the beans are tender, about 30 minutes. Add
more water, if needed. When beans are tender, set them aside in the
liquid. Remove tough stems of the greens; roughly chop leaves. Heat 2
tablespoons of the oil in a skillet and gently wilt the onion. Chop
the remaining garlic and sage leaves and add them to the onion, along
with the red pepper flakes. Cook for a few minutes, then add the
greens. Add 1/2 cup or so of cooking water from the beans and salt to
taste; cook until greens are tender, about 15 minutes. When greens
are done, add beans and enough liquid to make a little sauce. Cook
the pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water. When it is done,
scoop it out and add it directly to the greens and beans. Toss them
together, then turn into a heated serving dish. Drizzle the remaining
olive oil over the top, season with plenty of pepper and freshly
grated cheese.
