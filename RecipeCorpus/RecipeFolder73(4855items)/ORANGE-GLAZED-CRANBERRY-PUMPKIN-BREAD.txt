Categories: Breads, Desserts, Lamb, Breakfast
Yield: 8 Servings
3 1/2 c  All purpose flour
1 2/3 c  Sugar
2 ts Baking soda
2 ts Pumpkin pie spice
3/4 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1 cn Whole berry cranberry sauce
3/4 c  Chopped pecans
2/3 c  Vegetable oil
4    Eggs
Preheat Oven to 350 degrees. Generously grease two (2) 9 1/4" x 5
1/4" x 2" loaf pans. In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar,
baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, salt and baking powder. I a second
bowl stir together remaining ingredients until well mixed.  Add
pumpkin mixture to flour mixture and stir until all ingredients are
well moistened. Pour batter into loaf pans. Bake 65 minutes or until
breads test done with wooden pick. Cool in pans 10 minutes then
remove to cooling racks. Completely cool breads then drizzle glaze
over top and sides.  Makes 2 loaves. Glaze: In a small bowl, with
fork, mix 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 cup undiluted orange juice
concentrate and 1/8 teaspoon allspice, until smooth. Drizzle over the
cooled breads. (To be perfectly accurate I use this orange juice
glaze on many items during the course of 2 weeks, so I use a 6 oz can
of frozen oj concentrate, effectively tripling the recipe. This is a
hint). *use Ocean-Spray 16 oz can, if available.
