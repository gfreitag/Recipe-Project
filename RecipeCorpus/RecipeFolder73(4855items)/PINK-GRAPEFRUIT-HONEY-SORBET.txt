the recipe above. 2. Pour the liquid sorbet mixture into a 9-inch by
13-inch cake pan. Freeze. 3. When frozen, shave the now solid mixture
with a metal spatula. Place shavings in serving glasses and serve
immediately. 4. You may instead break the frozen sorbet into pieces
that will fit a food processor. Using the on and off button, process
the sorbet until it is very coarsely granulated. Serve immediately.

Notes: For best results use Ruby Red grapefruits. They are sweeter and
color the sorbet a gorgeous pink.
