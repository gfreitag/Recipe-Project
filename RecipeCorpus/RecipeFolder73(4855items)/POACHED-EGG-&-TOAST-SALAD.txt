2 1/2 ts Lemon juice
2 ts Red wine vinegar
2 ts Capers -- rinsed and
Drained
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper
4 lg Eggs -- room temperature
6 oz Mesclun or mixed salad

Whisk together 2 tablespoons water, oil, mustard, lemon juice,
vinegar, chopped capers and salt and pepper to taste in a bowl. Set
aside.

In a large saucepan, bring about 2 inches of lightly salted water to a

While eggs are poaching, toss greens with dressing. Toast bread, tear
each slice into pieces and toss with salad greens. Arrange on four
plates and top with a poached egg. Season to taste with salt and
pepper and garnish with sprouts if desired.
