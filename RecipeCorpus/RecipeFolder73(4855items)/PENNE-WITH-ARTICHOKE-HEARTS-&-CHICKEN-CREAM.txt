Categories: Pasta, Poultry
Yield: 2 Servings
8 oz Mostaccioli or Radiatore
-OR other medium pasta
-shape, uncooked
8 oz Canned artichoke hearts
- drained
1 tb Olive or vegetable oil
4 oz Boneless chicken breasts
-(without skin)
- cut into 1-inch cubes
1/2 c  Evaporated skimmed milk
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1/2 ts Dijon mustard with seeds
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
-- (optional)
Prepare pasta according to package directions. While pasta is cooking,
squeeze as much water from the artichoke hearts as possible and cut
each piece in half lengthwise.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and
artichoke hearts. Saute, stirring frequently, until chicken is golden
brown, about 6 minutes. Add the evaporated skimmed milk, parsley and
mustard to the pan and stir to remove the brown bits from the bottom
and sides of the pan. Heat to boiling and boil until the liquid is
reduced in volume by half.

Drain the pasta and transfer it to the skillet. (If the skillet is
not deep or large enough to hold both the pasta and the sauce, return
the pasta to the cooking pot and add the contents of the skillet to
the pot.) Heat over low heat, stirring, until the pasta is mixed well
with the sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste; toss in Parmesan cheese
if desired. Divide between two serving bowls and serve immediately.
