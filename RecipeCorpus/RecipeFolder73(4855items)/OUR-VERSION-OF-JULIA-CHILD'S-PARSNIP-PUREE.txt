In a saucepan, combine the parsnips and salt and enough water to just
coverthem. Bring to a boil and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until
tender and two thirds of the water has evaporated. Using a food mill
fitted with the fine blade or a food processor, puree the mixture and
season with salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste. Set the
pan over another containing simmering water, cover and let cook for
20 to 30 minutes more. (The parsnip puree improves in flavor with
this additional cooking.)

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
