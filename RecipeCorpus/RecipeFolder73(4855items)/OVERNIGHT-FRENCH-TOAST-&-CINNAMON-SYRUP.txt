TO PREPARE FRENCH TOAST:  In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together egg,
egg whites, milk, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and baking powder until
well blended. Place bread slices in a large shallow baking dish and
pour egg mixture over the top; turn to coat evenly. Press a piece of
wax paper directly on the bread to cover it, then cover dish with
plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight. TO MAKE CINNAMON SYRUP: In a
small saucepan, stir together sugar, corn syrup, cinnamon and 1/4 c
water. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring
constantly. Boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in
evaporated skim milk. Let cool; transfer to a small pitcher. (The
syrup can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
If desired, warm before serving.) TO COOK FRENCH TOAST: Heat 1 t oil
and 1/2 t butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
Add four of the soaked bread slices to the pan and cook until golden
on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the toast to a
platter and keep warm in a warm oven. Cook the remaining slices in
the same manner, using the remaining 1 t oil and 1/2 t butter. Serve
with cinnamon syrup.
