Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Orange juice, preferably
-fresh squeezed
3 tb Sugar
1    Vanilla bean, split and
-seeded
2    Bay leaves
Tiny pinch salt
1 pk Frozen phyllo dough, thawed
1/2 c  Melted butter
1/2 c  Sugar
4    Clementines, peeled and

1 pt Vanilla ice cream

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.

Reduce the orange juice to 1 1/2 cups in a small heavy saucepan with
the sugar, vanilla bean, bay leaves and salt. Let cool.

Unwrap and unroll the thawed phyllo dough. Remove 3 sheets and cut in
half to make 6. Reroll the remainder and wrap tightly. Return to the
refrigerator for another use. Brush each half sheet of phyllo with the
melted butter on both sides and sprinkle with sugar. With both hands
crumple the sheet to about the size of a squash ball. Repeat with the
remaining 5 sheets. Place each crumpled ball on a cookie sheet pan
and bake in the oven until browned, about 4 minutes. Reserve.

In each of 6 bowls, place 1 phyllo crumple, 6 clementine sections in
a ring next to it and pour 1/4 cup of the flavored orange syrup over
the fruit. Place a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on each ring of
fruit. Garnish with a mint sprig and serve. Posted to MM-Recipes
