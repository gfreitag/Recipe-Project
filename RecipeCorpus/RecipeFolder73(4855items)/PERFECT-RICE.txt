Place rice, water and salt in a saucepan. Bring liquid to a boil over
medium heat. Cover and simmer over low heat until the rice is as
tender as you like it, about 18 minutes. If there is any leftover
liquid in the pot, drain the rice in a strainer. Remove half of the
rice for another day. To remaining rice, stir in butter and cheese
and/or ham; adjust seasoning.
