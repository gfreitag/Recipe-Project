Title: PAPRIKA CHICKEN & ROASTED PEPPERS
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Batch Fricasseed Chicken
- with sauce, 3-1/3 to 4 lbs
- (See RECIPE) -
1/2 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
4 lg Red bell peppers
2 tb Paprika
-(pref. Hungarian sweet)
1/2 ts Ground coriander
1 tb Tomato paste
PREPARE OR DEFROST Fricasseed Chicken. Arrange chicken pieces in a
casserole or Dutch oven, add broth, cover, place in the oven and turn
the oven to 375F. Meanwhile, place peppers over the flame of a gas
stove or place under a preheated broiler and roast until peppers are
completely black. As they are done, place in a paper bag. Close
tightly and let rest for 5 minutes. Place peppers under cold running
water, rubbing to remove all blackened skin. Split peppers with your
thumb, lengthwise, remove seeds and stems and cut into thirds. Add
the peppers to the chicken. Place fricassee sauce in saucepan over
medium heat. Add paprika, coriander and tomato paste. Cook until
reduced to a sauce-like consistency thick enough to cling to a wooden
spoon. Uncover the chicken and peppers, strain the sauce over the top
and cook another 5 minutes. To serve, transfer chicken, peppers and
sauce to a serving bowl. Accompany with buttered noodles.
