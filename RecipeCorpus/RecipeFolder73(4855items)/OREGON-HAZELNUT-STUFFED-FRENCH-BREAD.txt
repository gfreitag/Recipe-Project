Title: OREGON HAZELNUT-STUFFED FRENCH BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Lg loaves
MMMMM---------------------------BREAD--------------------------------
2 tb Dry yeast
2 1/2 c  Warm water (105-110 F.)
7 c  Bread flour, unsifted
1 tb Salt
1 tb Butter; melted
1    Egg white; mixed with...
1 tb Water
Cornmeal for dusting
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2    Garlic cloves; chopped
1 tb Dijon mustard
3/4 c  Finely chopped hazelnuts
-(Oregon hazelnuts)
1/3 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1/4 c  Butter, soft
1 c  Grated Swiss cheese
Thoroughly mix all filling ingredients together and set aside.

Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add salt and butter, blend until well
mixed. Knead until dough is elastic and smooth, about 10 minutes.
Place in greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled, about 1
hour. Divide dough into 2 pieces and roll into oblong pieces 15x12
inches. Spread each with 1/2 of the filling. Roll up sealing as you
roll. Place on greased baking sheets dusted with cornmeal, seam side
down. Let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Make 3 or 4 diagonal cuts
on each loaf. Bake in 450 oven for 25 minutes. Remove, brush with egg
white and water mix, bake 5 minutes more.

For best results, keep oven very hot and place a pan with 1 inch of
water on the bottom rack. This steam will create the classic crunchy
crust of good French bread.
