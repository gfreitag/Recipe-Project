From Modern Priscilla Cook Book  (Year and author unknown)

This cookbook was given to Margie by her grandmother, She (her
grandmother) received it from her mother when she was married. We
don't know when or where Margie's g-grandmother got it. It is so old
and worn that the pages are starting to flake, and the front cover
cannot be read so we don't know who wrote this one. There is also no
dates or cover pages in the book. Pastry in next recipe-Gary
