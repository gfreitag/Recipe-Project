2 lb Italian sausage, sweet
2 lb Italian sausage, hot
4 1/2 c  -Spicy Tomato Sauce
2 c  Ricotta cheese
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, imported,
-freshly grated
3/4 c  Parsley, fresh, chopped
2 1/2 tb Oregano, dried
2    Eggs
Freshly ground black pepper
4 c  Mozzarella cheese, grated
Pizza dough, raised once
Preheat oven to 350øF.
In a heavy skillet saut sausages until brown. Drain well and
transfer to a bowl. Stir Spicy Tomato Sauce into the sausages and
reserve.
Mix ricotta, Parmesan, 1/2 cup of parsley, 2 tablespoons of
oregano, 1 egg, and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
In a rectangular ovenproof dish, about 9 x 13 inches, spread half
of the sausage mixture. Dot this with half of the ricotta mixture and
sprinkle 2 cups of the mozzarella evenly over the entire surface.
Sprinkle with 1/2 of the remaining parsley and half of the remaining
oregano. Repeat.
Roll out three-quarters of the dough to a thickness of about 1/3
inch, being certain the dough is about 1 inch larger than the pan all
the way around. Transfer dough to top of pizza and tuck in excess all
around. Beat remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush some of
it on top of crust.
Roll out remaining dough and use it to form decorative shapes, cut
with cookie cutters if you like. Arrange shapes on top of crust,
brush again with beaten egg, and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until
the top is golden brown and the edges are bubbling.
Let pizza stand for 30 minutes before cutting.
