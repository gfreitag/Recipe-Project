Title: PIKELETS (BAKESTONE RECIPES)
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 8 Servings
8 oz Plain or unbleached flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 oz Fresh yeast*
1 ts Sugar
5 fl Warm water
1 ts Butter
5 fl Warm milk
1    Egg, beaten
*Or 1 1/2 t dried yeast.  -- These are similar to crumpets -- they
are made with a yeast batter, but cooked without rings. -- Sift the
flour and salt into a warm bowl. Dissolve the yeast and the sugar in
the warm water. Melt the butter in the warm milk and beat in the egg.
Stir the yeast liquid and then the milk mixture into the flour. Mix
into a smooth batter and beat well. Cover and leave in a warm place
for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the batter is thick and bubbling. Warm
the bakestone and grease with a piece of lard on a fork (use a piece
of fat back if you're short of lard). When a drop of water sputters
on the bakestone, it's hot enough. Stir the batter, then use a ladle
or a jug to pour it onto the bakestone in round "puddles|, leaving
space in between so that the pikelets will be easy to turn. The yeast
batter will not spread as much as pancake batter. Cook over a
moderate heat until bubbles break the top surface and the underneath
is pale gold.  Flip over the pikelets and cook the other side until
honey-colored.  Keep wach batch warm in a folded cloth in a low oven.
Serve with butter, honey or preserves, or for a savory dish, with
cream cheese or grilled bacon, or little sausages. To reheat, crisp
under the grill.
