mash with fork.

Remove cinnamon stick and add milk-toast mixture to the meat;
remove from the heat.  Add cheese and eggs, and mix well.

Melt remaining butter; butter a pan abt. 2 inches smaller than the
phyllo.  Put 7 to 8 phyllo sheets, buttering each before addint it,
into the pan, letting phyllo extend on all sides. Pour in meat
mixture and spread it ivenly.  Fold overlapping phyllo back onto
meat. Butter these well.  Carefully cut remaining sheets of phyllo to
fit the top of the pan. Brush each with butter and lay on the filling
to make the top of the pitta. Pour on any remaining butter and
sprinkle the top very lightly with a little water (to keep phyllo
from rising too high). Bake in preheated 350 F. oven for 30 to 40
min.  Cool abt. 30 min, and cut into squares to serve.

NOTE:  It is easier to cut this if you score it lightly before
baking.
