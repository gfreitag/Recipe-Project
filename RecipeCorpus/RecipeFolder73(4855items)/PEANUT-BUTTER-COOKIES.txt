Title: PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 24 Servings
1 1/4 c  Flour
3/4 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Margarine (l stick)
1/2 c  Peanut butter
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Packed brown sugar
1    Egg
1/2 ts Vanilla
Stir together flour, soda, and salt.  In a mixer bowl beat butter for
30 seconds.  Add peanut butter and sugars; beat till fluffy. Add egg
and vanilla; beat well. Add dry ingredients to beaten mixture; beat
till well combined.  Shape dough into 1 inch balls; roll in
granulated sugar, if desired.  Place 2 inches apart on an ungreased
cookie sheet; crisscross with the tines of a fork. Bake at 375 for
9-10 minutes .
Cool about 1 minute before removing to a wire rack.
Makes 48. For an alternative, do not crisscross with a fork. Simply
cook as directed.  Upon removing cookies from the oven, place a
chocolate candy Kiss in the center of each cookie, unwrappped of
course.
Press slightly and cool completely.  You can wrap cookie dough into
a 1 inch ball around a candy kiss and cook as directed. This gives
you a cookie with a chocolate center. This is also another great
alternative.
