Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  Flour
6 oz Very cold unsalted butter --
1/2    -inch cubes
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Sugar
1/3 c  Cold water
12 oz Cream cheese
4 oz Heavy whipping cream --
Whipped to soft peak
1/2 c  Powdered sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1    Very ripe papaya, peeled --
Cut in 1/4" slices
1/2 c  Peach glaze, melted
1/2 c  Macadamia nuts -- toasted
8 oz Bitter chocolate
8 oz Semisweet chocolate
2 1/2 c  Heavy cream
4 tb Warm water
STEP ONE: Prepare the Tart Shell-- Sift together the flour, salt, and
sugar. Coat butter cubes with the flour mixture and water and knead
until malleable, but not homogeneous. (The amount of water given is
approximate; adjust the amount used according to the dough's
consistency.) Leave bits of plain butter, otherwise the dough becomes
too elastic. Gently roll dough to 1/4-inch thickness and lay onto a
tart pan. Trim edges and poke bottom of pastry with a fork. Bake in
oven at 350 degrees F for about ten minutes or until tart shell
browns slightly. Chill.

STEP TWO: Prepare Cream Cheese Filling-- Whip whipping cream until it
forms soft peaks. In a mixer, beat cream cheese until it becomes
fluffy. Fold in whipped cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract.
Set aside.

STEP THREE: Assemble Tart-- Fill tart shell with cream cheese mixture.
Arrange papaya slices in a pinwheel design over the top of the cream
cheese. Place macadamia nuts in center of tart. With a pastry brush,
coat top of tart with peach glaze. Refrigerate for 1/2 hour before
serving.

STEP FOUR: Prepare Chocolate Sauce-- Heat bitter chocolate, semisweet
chocolate, heavy cream, and warm water in a saucepan, stirring
frequently, until sauce is a smooth consistency.

STEP FIVE: To Serve-- Slice tart into 8 pieces. Drizzle chocolate
sauce onto plate and place one piece of tart on each plate.
