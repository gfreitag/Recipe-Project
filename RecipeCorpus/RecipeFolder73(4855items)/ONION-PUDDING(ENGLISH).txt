Title: ONION PUDDING(ENGLISH)
Categories: Puddings, English
Yield: 4 Servings
4 oz Flour
2 oz Shredded suet
1/2 lb Onions peeled and
-finely chopped
Salt and black pepper
Mix the flour and suet together then  add sufficient cold water to
form a firm dough. Turn out on to a lightly floured surface and roll
out to form a oblong about about 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle the onion
over the dough, and season well. Roll up like a Swiss Roll and damp
the ends to seal. Wrap lightly in greaseproof paper, then tie up in a
cloth. Place in a saucepan of boiling water, cover and cook for 1 to
1 1/2 hours; alternatively steam similarly. Top up with boiling water
as necessary. Serve cut into thick slices, each slice topped with a
pat of butter, as an accompaniment to boiled bacon or boiled beef.

A cottager's pudding, often served with a piece of boiled bacon and,
by tradition, cooked in the same pot.
