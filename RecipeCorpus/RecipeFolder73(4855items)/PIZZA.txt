Title: PIZZA
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
2 c  Tepid water
2 pk Instant yeast
4 tb Olive oil
5 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Corn meal
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Salad oil
Mix this with 3 c flour for about 10 minutes. Then add rest of flour
and kneed 15 more minutes. Let dough rise once to double size. Punch
down. Then divide the dough in two (makes two pizzas). Spread out
dough flat. Oil the pan with olive oil and sprinkle with corn meal.
Spread the dough out in the pan and spread it around to cover the
entire bottom, then push it up the sides - like a pie crust.  If it
doesn't cover the whole pan push it around til it does. Let it rise
again. Put thin slices of mozzarella over the entire bottom of the
pizza. Squish and drain well one large can of skinned plum tomatoes,
and spread that over the cheese. Add a smidge of salt (I also add
ground black pepper). Chop or crush garlic over this (I use lots).
Basil and oregano sprinkled generously on top. Put on filing to taste
(I use sliced onions and spicy Italian sausage). Then sprinkle over
the top a combo of fresh grated Parma and Romano. Bake for 35 to 40
min at 475. Crust should be brown and crunchy. Hope you like it. I
usually make two at a time, with one having no meat on it for the
non-meat crowd (using zuccini peppers, mushrooms, onions). One pizza
is usually enough for 4 people with a salad. Hope you like it, David.
