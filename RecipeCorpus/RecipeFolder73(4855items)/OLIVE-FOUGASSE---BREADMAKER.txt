Title: OLIVE FOUGASSE - BREADMAKER
Categories: Abm
Yield: 2 Loaves
1 tb Bread machine yeast
2 1/2 c  Bread flour
2 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Warm milk
1/2 c  Water
1/4 c  Fruity olive oil, + extra
-for coating the dough
1/3 c  Chopped Nicoise or green
-olives
Combine the yeast, flour, sugar, salt, milk, water and 1/4 cup olive
oil in the bread machine pan and process on the dough setting. At the
end of the cycle, turn out the dough onto a lightly floured board and
knead in the olives. Turn the bread pan over the dough and let it
rest for 15 minutes.

Divide the dough into two equal pieces and roll each piece into an 8
~by-10-inch rectangle. Place each rectangle on a parchment
paper-covered baking sheet. Make two rows of 6 to 8 evenly spaced
diagonal slashes, cutting all the way through the dough. Open these
slits by pulling them well apart with your hands. Coat the flatbreads
with olive oil and set aside to rise until the dough is puffed, about
20    minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 F. After the breads are puffy, bake in the
hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on a rack.
These are best eaten the day they're made, but they can be stored in
plastic wrap.

NOTE:  This olive-rich is rolled into aangle and thenslashed with a
knife to form traditional patterns. The sunburst is popular, or a
tree branch, a moon, or a sunflower. You won't need butter with this
olive oil -drenched bread. It's a perfect accompaniment to salade
Nicoise. Use dough setting.
