Title: PEANUTTY ROCKY ROAD
Categories: Desserts, Candies, Holidays
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Milk chocolate; coasrsely
-chopped
8 oz Large marshmallows;
-cut into quarters
1 c  Unsalted roasted peanuts
In a heatproof bowl over hot, not simmering water, heat the chocolate
till almost completely melted. Remove from the water and let stand,
stirring occasionally, until the residual heat melts the chocolate
completely. Let the chocolate cool until tepid. Lightly butter a
baking sheet. Stir the marshmallows and peanuts into the tepid
chocolate. (Stir a marshmallow into the chocolate as a temperature
test. If it melts, the chocolate is still too warm; cool longer. If
the chocolate stiffens, heat over hot water until the chocolate is
softened.) Spread onto the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate until
firm, at least 4 hours. Cut into pieces. (Store the rocky road at
room temperature in an airtight container.) Makes about 1-3/4 pounds.
