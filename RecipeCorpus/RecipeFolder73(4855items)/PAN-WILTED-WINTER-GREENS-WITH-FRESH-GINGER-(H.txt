(Not really "Heart Healthy" because of the sodium content, but no
fat, so I'll include it in the category.)

In a very large skillet, combine the ginger, salt and 1/2 cup of
water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the spinach, kale and
Swiss chard, packing them down with the pan lid. Cover and cook over
high heat, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes.
