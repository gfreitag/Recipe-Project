Clean hairs from pork snouts by scrapping them with a knife. Remove
excess fat. When snouts are clean put the them in a pot and cover
with enough water to boil.
When you think that the snouts are tender and soft let them cool off
and then cut the snouts into inch size pieces.
Mix the rest of the ingredients in with the cut snouts. Taste a
little bit so you can see if you need to add more of one or two of
the ingredients to suit your taste.
