Heat oven to 325 degrees.

Scald cream or half and half in heavy saucepan. Cook over medium heat
until liquid is reduced by one quarter, to 3 cups. Stir in vanilla
and set aside.

Beat eggs and yolks in large bowl with orange juice, 2 tbsps sugar and
orange rind. Gradually pour in hot cream while whisking vigorously.
Set aside.

Dissolve remaining sugar in water. Heat in heavy skillet until syrup
is golden brown.

Pour caramel syrup into six custard cups, tipping and turning cups
until insides are evenly coated. Let caramel sit until set.

Pour egg mixture into cups over caramel syrup. Place cups in large
pan of hot water. Bake 25 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the
center comes out clean. Cool completely.

Unmold flans onto individual dessert plates so that caramel side is
on top. Sprinkle with almond slices and serve.
