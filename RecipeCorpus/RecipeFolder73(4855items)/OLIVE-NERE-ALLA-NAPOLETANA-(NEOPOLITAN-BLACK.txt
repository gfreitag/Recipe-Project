Title: OLIVE NERE ALLA NAPOLETANA (NEOPOLITAN BLACK
Categories: Spice mix
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 lb Black olives; (gaeta)
Olive oil
Lemon juice
1 pn Majoram
1 pn Oregano
The small Gaeta olives, highly prized by Italians, are available in
specialty food stores. Greek or Moroccan style black olives may be
substituted, but the flavor of the Gaeta is matchless. Pit the olives
and place in a shallow dish. Pour in enough oil to barely cover and
add lemon juice to taste. Season with majoram and oregano and stir
gently to combine the flavors. Cover and store in a cool place for
several hours or overnight, stirring occasionally. Do not
refrigerate!! Serves 6.
