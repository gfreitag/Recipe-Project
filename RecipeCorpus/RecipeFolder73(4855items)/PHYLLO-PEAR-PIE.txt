2. Quarter, peel and core pears. Cut each quarter crosswise in
1/2-inch-thick slices. Put pears and remaining Filling ingredients in
a large, heavy saucepan.

3. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 10 to 12 minutes,
stirring occasionally, until pears are tender but not mushy. Spoon
mixture into 9-inch pie plate. Let cool slightly.

4. Lay 1 sheet phyllo over filling. Spray all over with nonstick
cooking spray. Lay second sheet crosswise over first and spray.
Continue layering and spraying remaining 2 sheets phyllo, slightly

ruffled edge. Spray edges, then sprinkle entire top with remaining
teaspoon sugar. Cut slits through all layers phyllo for steam to
escape while baking.
