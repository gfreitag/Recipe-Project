until most of the liquid has evaporated, 15 to 20 minutes for fresh
tomatoes (about 15 minutes for canned tomatoes).

Press back of large spoon into tomato sauce in places, forming 8
wells. Carefully break 1 egg into each well. Season eggs with salt

Sprinkle cheese over eggs. Cover skillet and let stand until cheese is
melted, about 1 minute. Gently spoon sauce and eggs over toast. Serve
immediately.

TIP:  Make sauce ahead and keep refrigerated. Or substitute thick
ready-made tomato sauce for homemade sauce.
