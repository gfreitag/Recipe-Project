Title: PENNE WITH VODKA & SPICY TOMATO-CREAM SAUCE
Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
4    Plump fresh garlic cloves --
Minced
1/2 ts Crushed red peppers -- (hot
Red pepper flak
Or to taste
Sea salt
1    28 oz Can
-
Or 1 28-oz can crushed
Tomatoes in puree
1 lb Dried Italian tubular pasta
Such as penne
2 tb Vodka
1 c  Heavy (whipping) cream
1/4 c  Fresh flat-leaf parsley
Leaves -- snipped
Peeled Italian plum tomatoes
In juice
In an unheated skillet large enough to hold the pasta later on,
combine oil, garlic, crushed red peppers and a pinch of salt,
stirring to coat with oil. Cook  over moderate heat just until the
garlic turns golden but not brown, 2 to 3 minutes. If using whole
canned tomatoes, place a food mill over the skillet and puree
tomatoes directly into it. Crushed tomatoes can be added directly.
Stir to blend, and simmer, uncovered, until sauce begins to thicken,
about 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning. Meanwhile, in a large pot,
bring 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil. Add 3 tablespoons salt and
the penne, stirring to prevent sticking. Cook until tender but firm
to the bite. Drain thoroughly. Add the drained pasta to the skillet
with the tomato sauce. Toss. Add the vodka, toss again, then add the
cream and toss. Cover, reduce the heat to low for 1 to 2 minutes to
allow the pasta to absorb the  sauce. Add the parsley and toss again.
Transfer to warmed shallow soup bowls and serve immediately.
