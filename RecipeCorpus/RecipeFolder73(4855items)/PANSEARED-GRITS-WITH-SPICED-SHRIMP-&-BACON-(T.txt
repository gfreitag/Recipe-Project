In a medium saucepan, stir the grits and salt into the boiling water.
Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Remove from the heat and pout into a buttered 8x8-inch
dish. Let cool until firm. Remove from the dish and cut into
quarters. Fry the bacon in a large heavy skillet over medium heat.
With slotted spoon, remove the bacon and drain on paper towels,
reserving the fat in the pan.

In the same skillet, sear the quartered grits over high heat until
golden on both sides. With a spatula, transfer to a platter.

Combine the salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, and cayenne in a bowl. Add
the shrimp and toss to coat evenly.

Wipe the skillet clean and heat the olive oil over high heat. Saute
the shrimp 1 to 2 minutes. Toss in the jalapenos, green onion, garlic
and reserved bacon and cook 1 minute longer. Remove from heat and
stir in the lime juice. Scatter over the seared grits and serve.

Yield: 2 to 4 serving
