Categories: Household, Better
Yield: 1 Servings

1 c  Mineral oil
1 tb Pine oil
1/4 c  SOFT SOAP
1 c  Warm water
** Unlike a simple polish which just shines your fine wood, this
cleaner will remove some dust residue while returning shine to the
finish. For heavily soiled furniture or wood, wash first will
ALL-PURPOSE CLEANER and then follow up with this solution to bring
back the shine.

Mix mineral and pine oils in a glass or enamel bowl. Stir in the SOFT
SOAP and warm water, continuing to stir until all ingreds are
thoroughly mixed. Pour into clean qt size jar or bottle, cap and
label. Keep out of the reach of children.

To Use: Pour about 1T of the solution onto a soft cloth and then
polish. Turn the cloth frequently, adding more solution if necessary,
to clean the wood. Finish by buffing with a clean, dry cloth. Repeat
the process if the wood is especially soiled, but do not allow the
wood to become soaked. If you're working with FINE FURNITURE, USE A
MINIMUM OF CLEANING SOLUTION AND CLEAN WITH GENTLE STROKES.

Note: Never use any cleaning solution made with ammonia to wash your
furnitrue because the ammonia will dissolve whatever kind of finish
is on the wood.
