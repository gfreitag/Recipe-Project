"This is an unbelievably quick fix for a cocktail or soup
accompaniment."

Makes 2 approximately 12x8-inch sheets
=======================================================
================== 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

2. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the flour, salt and pepper.

3. Add the oil and stir until mixture resembles fine meal.

4. With a fork, stir in the cold water, using just enough to make
the dough gather into a ball.

5. Divide the dough in half and, on a well-floured board, roll out
each
half as thinly as possible into a rough rectangle that fits on a
baking sheet.

6. Place dough on baking sheet and if you want neat-looking crackers,
score it into squares or diamonds.

7. Bake for 25-30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes. Dough should be a
pale brown and snap, not bend.

8. Break into crackers or irregular pieces. Can be stored in a tin.

Variations: Instead of black pepper, season with hot red pepper
flakes or any other spice that seems appropriate to the crackers'
eventual use. Or, after the dough has been transferred to a baking
sheet, sprinkle with coarse salt and press lightly into the top.
