Title: PERSIAN PUMPKIN STEW
Categories: Stews
1 lb stew meat  -- (lamb or
beef)
Yield: 1 Servings
:
2 sm pumpkin  -- or 1 med-small
pumpk
:
1/2 c  dried prunes
3 TB tomato paste
1 ts turmeric
1/8 ts cinnamon
1/2 md onion  -- chopped
salt and pepper to taste
:
1 pn saffron disolved in 1/4c.
warm water  -- optional
:

Brown the meat and add about 1 and 1/2 cups water. Add tomato paste,
turmeric, cinnamon, saffron and salt and pepper and sauteed onion.
Cook covered ata simmer for about 1 and 1/2 to two hours. Meat should
be tender and nearly falling apart stage.  You may need to add water
during cooking but you shouldn't end up with more than the stated
amount. You don't want a watery stew. In the meantime, seed the
pumpkin and slice into 2X2 inch pieces and peel.  Brown on both sides
in corn oil. The pumpkin should become brown in some places and
somewhat flexible but not totally cooked. Add to meat and cook
covered an additional 20-30 minutes until tender but not falling
apart.  A fork should go into the pumpkin easily but not break it up.
Add the prunes the last 5 minutes of cooking. They shouldn't really
cook too much but should get warm. Serve over hot basmatic rice. Note
on pumpkin: ~--------------- Baking pumpkins are the best since they
are sweeter and less stringy.  I have used jack o lantern pumpkins
when feeling frugal and the dish was still good. You want about twice
the volume of meat in peeled pumpkin slices.
