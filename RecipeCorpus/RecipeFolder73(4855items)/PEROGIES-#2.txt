DOUGH: In a bowl, combine flour with salt. Beat together egg, water
and oil; stir the into flour mixture to make a soft but not sticky
dough that holds together in a ball. If necessary, add water 1 tsp at
a time, being careful not to make dough sticky. Turn out dough onto a
lightly floured surface; knead until smooth. Halve dough, cover with
plastic wrap or damp cloth. Let rest for 20 minutes.

FILLING: Meanwhile in a skillet, heat butter over medium heat. Cook
onion for 3 to 5 minutes or till tender. Transfer to a bowl, add mix
in potatoes, cheese, salt and pepper. Working with one portion of the
dough at a time, and keeping the remaining dough covered, roll out on
a lightly floured surface to 1/16" thickness. Using a 3" cutter, cut
dough into rounds. Place 1 tsp filling on each round. Lightly moisten
edge of one half of dough with water, pinch edges together to seal
and crimp. Place on a cloth and cover with damp cloth to prevent
drying out. Repeat with remaining portion of dough.

COOKING:In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook perogies in
batches, for about 2 minutes or till they float to the top, stirring
gently to prevent perogies from sticking together or to bottom of
pan. With slotted spoon remove to a colander to drain. In a large
heavy skillet, melt butter over medium heat, cook onion for about 5
minutes till golden. Add perogies and toss to coat and warm through.
Serve with sour cream.

VARIATIONS:

~1- Cottage Cheese: Combine 1 cup press cottage cheese, 1 beaten egg,
1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper and 1 Tbsp chopped green onion.

~2- Garnish with bacon bits and fry the onion in the bacon fat.

~3- Pan fry the perogies in butter or bacon fat after they have been
boiled and drained until golden brown

~4-Deep fry raw perogies until the skin is bubbled and golden brown,
making sure that the cheese filling which will melt does not leak
into the hot fat. Crimp well.

~5-Dessert perogies: Use a filling of Saskatoon berries [like blue
berries] sprinkled with sugar. Boil, don't fry. Garnish with
sweetened whipped cream and sprinkle with poppy seeds.
