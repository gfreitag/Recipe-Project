center of foil.  Fold foil to make an airtight package. Label with

Makes 1 package ONION SEASONING MIX. Use this mix whenever your
recipe calls for dry onion soup mix. I use empty bouillon jars, baby
food jars, or those little gift jelly jars to store this mix in. P.S.
Instant Beef Bouillon Gran. - means granules. Robbie Shelton Alvin,
