prepare the Salsa Cruda. When the pasta is done, drain well and rinse
under cold water until completely cool.

Crumble the turkey into a large skillet. Add chili powder. Place the
skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until the
turkey is cooked through and crumbled into small bits. Drain the
turkey in a colander.

Drain the salsa well. In a straight-sided, 2-quart casserole dish,
layer the pasta, then the lettuce, then the turkey and the avocado,
then the salsa, reserving about 1/4 cup of the salsa for the top.
Spread the non-fat yogurt in an even layer over the top and pour the
remaining salsa over the yogurt. Cover the bowl tightly and
refrigerate 2 to 4 hours.

Bring to room temperature 30 minutes before serving. Garnish with
tortilla chips, if desired.
