Title: PARA-GUACAMOLE
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 12 Servings
3 ea California avocadoes
1 ea Poblano chile
2 ea Serrano chiles
1 ea Small white onion
3 ea Cloves garlic
3 ea Juice of 2-3 lemons
1/4 ts Powdered cumin
1 ts Tabasco sauce
1 ea Salt to taste
Roast the poblano chile over a low flame (or under a broiler) until
the skin begins to char and blister. Place in a paper bag and let set
for a few minutes. While the poblano is 'steaming', mince the onion
and place in a large bowl.  De-seed  and  scoop  out  the avocadoes,
taking care to discard any brown portions Place the avocado in bowl
with onion and pound into slightly lumby paste. Take the poblano
chile out of the bag and peel it, removing the stem, seeds, and
internal membranes. Remove the stem end of the serranos Peel the
garlic cloves. Place the poblano,serranos, garlic, lemon juice,
cumin, and Tabasco sauce in a blender and whizz until pureed. Add
this to the avocado/onion mixture in the large bowl and mix
thoroughly. The flavor blends better if the guacamole is left in the
refrigerator for an hour or two before serving. There are at least as
many variations of Guacamole as there are people who make it, but
this version may offend some purists, hence the name. This recipe is
the result of experimentation with the basic guacamole recipe.  I
personally prefer more cumin in it, but you don't want the result to
taste more like bean dip than guacamole. Never use Florida avocadoes
for guacamole -- you'll get a watery green pulp.
