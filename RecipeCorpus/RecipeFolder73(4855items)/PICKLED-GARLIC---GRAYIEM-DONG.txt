Title: PICKLED GARLIC - GRAYIEM DONG
Categories: Thai, Condiment
Yield: 1 Servings
10    Heads Fresh Garlic, Unpeeled
1/2 c  White Vinegar
3/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Salt
Wash the garlic heads in cool water.  Trim the stem end without
cutting into the cloves and set aside. Combine the vinegar, sugar and
salt in a small saucepan and bring to a rolling boil. Stir and boil
for 1 minute. When the sugar and salt are dissolved, reduce the heat
and simmer gently until slightly thickened, about 5minutes. Remove
from the heat and cool to room temperature.  Place the garlic in a
jar or crock with a tight fitting lid and pour in the pickling brine
to immerse the garlic completely. Seal tightly and store in a cool,
dark place for 2 to 3 weeks before using. Makes about 1 quart.
