The packages of boneless, unmarinated fajita strips are good for
this. Cut chicken pieces into bite sized pieces. Melt butter in a
skillet, add chicken pieces and teriyaki sauce. Cook until browned on
all sides. Remove the chicken pieces to a plate. Add the mushroom
soup and milk, stirring until smooth. You may need to add a little
extra milk if you have a lot of chicken and vegetables. Add the fresh
mushrooms and cook for 3 minutes. Add the cooked chicken pieces,
waterchestnuts and bamboo shoots. Simmer for 10 minutes. Serve with
rice and chow mien noodles. Preparation Time: 30 minutes. There are
many optional items that can be added to this recipe. For example
Chinese pea pods, chopped celery, bean spouts, cashews or almonds,
etc. For any vegetables, add them in right with or after the
mushrooms. Note: For adding any nuts add them in right before serving
as they tend to get soggy with cooking. ~--
