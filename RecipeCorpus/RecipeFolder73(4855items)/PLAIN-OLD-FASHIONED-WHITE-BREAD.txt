Title: PLAIN OLD FASHIONED WHITE BREAD
Categories: Abm, Misc
Yield: 1 Loaf
-GORDON [GEnie]
1 1/4 c  -water
3 c  Bread flour; (I use 1/2 cup
-whole wheat and 2 1/2 reg)
1 ts Salt
2 tb Powdered milk
1 tb Sugar;  (if you have trouble
- with raising try 2)
1 tb Margarine; or olive oil
1 1/2 ts Powdered yeast
When the ABM starts look inside and watch the dough it should be just
one big ball that is fairly soft, if its sticky and gooshy you have
to add more flour. If there is still flour laying around and its as
hard as a brick you have to add water. You have to do this with just
about every NEW recipe until you get the right combination for your
machine, flour, and climate.

First thing you need to do is get some bread flour (there is a
difference) and get some yeast in bulk. Do not use the little
packages they are just to expensive. Most of the big warehouse clubs
carry yeast in bigger packages.

If this don't work get back to us and tell us what is going on.
