Rinse and drain chard well.  Trim off coarse stem ends; then cut stems
crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide strips and set aside. Cover chard leaves
and refrigerate. In a 3-quart or larger electric cooker, combine
chard stems, lentils, onion, garlic, cumin seeds, red pepper flakes,
and black pepper. Pour in water. Cover and cook at low setting until
lentils are tender when mashed with a fork (6 to 7 hours). Cut chard
leaves crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips; stir into cooker.
Increase heat setting to high; cover and cook until chard is wilted
and bright green (about 15 minutes more). Meanwhile, in a 5- to
6-quart pan, cook linguine in 3 quarts boiling water just until
tender to bite (10 to 12 minutes); or cook according to package
directions.  Drain well; pour into a warm wide 4-quart bowl. Season
lentil sauce to taste with salt. Add lentil sauce and Neufchatel
cheese to linquine; mix lightly to coat well. Offer Parmesan cheese
to add taste, if desired.  Makes 6 servings.
