The whole kitchen will smell wonderful. These freeze well if tightly
wrapped.

In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until soft and fluffy; beat
in egg and vanilla. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; add to
creamed mixture and mix well. Chill dough thoroughly.

Preheat oven to 375ø. Roll dough out to 1/4-inch thick on lightly
floured board. Cut with cookie cutters and arrange on ungreased
cookie sheets. Sprinkle chopped pistachios on top; press down lightly.

Bake at 375ø for about 5 minutes or until edges start to brown.
Remove to wire racks to cool.
