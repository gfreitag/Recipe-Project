Makes 1 package of Upside-Down Cake Mix.

TO USE: Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in a 9 x 1 1/2 inch round
skillet or cake pan. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. Drain
and reserve the liquid from the can of pinapple;arrange the pinapple
pieces attractively in the pan; if desired, garnish with maraschino
cherries or nuts. Pour 1 package of the Upside-Down Cake Mix into a
mixing bowl; add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and either 1/2 cup milk
or 1/2 cup of the reserved pinapple juice.  Beat for 2minutes at slow
to medium speed or 2 minutes by hand averaging a rapid 135 strokes
per minute. Add 1 egg and beat 1 more minute scraping the sides of
bowl frequently. Spread the batter over the fruit in the pan. Bake at
375 degrees F. for 25 to 30 minutes or until a knife inserted at the
center comes out clean. Invert the pan onto a rackand let the cake
remain there a few minutes so that the syrup can drain into the cake.

APPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE: Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon over the melted
butter and brown sugar. Instead of pinapple, use 2 to 2 1/2 cups apple
wedges or slices; sprinkle apples with raisins and pecan halves. Pour
batter over fruit and bake as directed.

CHERRY UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE: Replace pinapple with a 16-ounce can of
drained, sour red or sweet black cherries; no garnish necessary. If
using sour cherries, increase brown sugar to 2/3 cup. Make as
directed.

CRANBERRY UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE: Use 1 cup packed brown sugar; use 2 cups
uncooked cranberries in place of the pinapple. Make as directed.
