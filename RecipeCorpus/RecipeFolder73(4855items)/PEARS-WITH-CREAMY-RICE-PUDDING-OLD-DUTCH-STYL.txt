Title: PEARS WITH CREAMY RICE PUDDING OLD DUTCH STYL
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------PEARS--------------------------------
4    Cooking pears
1/2 l  Water
40 g  Sugar
1 ts Vinegar
1    Stick of cinnamon (*)
Piece of lemon peel (just
-the yellow part, the
-white is too bitter)
1 ts Potato-flour (or other kind
-to thicken the juice that
-keeps it clear)
MMMMM----------------------------RICE---------------------------------
2 1/2 dl Milk
2 tb Rice (the type to make
-rice-milk)
1    Grated peel of 1 melon
-again, just the yellow bit
2    Sheets of gelatine (*)
1 tb Vanilla flavoured sugar (*)
2 tb Sugar
1/8 l  Whipping cream
Peel the pears, leave the stem on (looks nice). In a pan, bring the
water, pears, cinnamon and lemon peel to a boil. Stew for 3 1/2
hours. Bring back to a boil. Put the potato-flour in a cup and add a
little water, stir. Stir it bit by bit into the boiling pear stuff
until set to the thickness of sauce. Let boil for another few
minutes. (Remove the cinnamon stick if you prefer). Put rice, milk
and lemon grating into pan and boil for 30 minutes. Soak the gelatine
in a generous amount of (cold!) water for 10 minutes until soft.
Squeeze the water out of the gelatine and add the gelatine to the
rice mixture (TAKE THE PAN AWAY FROM THE STOVE). Don't boil it again!
The gelatine will not set and it tastes yukky. Add the vanilla sugar
and the regular sugar. Let it cool down. Whip the cream until stiff.
Work the cream into the rice mixture carefully using 2 large spoons.
Cool again.

Serving suggestion: Reheat the pears until just warm. Serve them on
the side with the rice pudding. Pour some of the pear juice over the
pudding. Enjoy!

(*) Stick of cinnamon: you *could* replace it with powder, but it
won't taste the same (*) In the Netherlands we use sheets of
gelatine. If you add up the
volumes of the ingredients i'm sure you can work out how much
clear (no taste) gelatine powder of your own you should use. (*) If
you don't have vanilla flavoured sugar, use regular and add
some vanilla flavouring. Or even better: add a cut-open vanilla
pod to the rice mixture while cooking. Scrape out the black centre
and add to the pudding after cooking.

IMHO this recipe seems very little for 4 servings. The rice pudding
can be rather heavy though. If you make it for visitors, just make
sure to make a double portion, just in case they want seconds! And
rice pudding is even better the next day. Cooking pears can also be
eaten cold.
