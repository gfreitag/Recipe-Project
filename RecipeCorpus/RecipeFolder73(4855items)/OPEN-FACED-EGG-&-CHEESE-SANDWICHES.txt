Categories: Sandwiches, Main dish, Cheese, Vegetarian, Eggs
Yield: 6 Sandwiches
1 tb Butter or margarine
2 tb Onion, finely chopped
2 tb Green pepper, finely chopped
6    Eggs; beaten
1/3 c  Milk
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
6    English muffin halves
1 tb Butter or margarine
6 sl American cheese (1 oz. each)
-- (pasteurized process)
Melt 1 tablespoon fat in a large frypan.  Add onion and green pepper.
Cook until tender.  Mix eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. Pour over onion
and green pepper.

Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally to let uncooked portion flow
beneath cooked portion. Continue cooking until eggs are set but still
moist. Divide into 6 portions.

Spread toasted muffin halves with 1 tablespoon butter or margarine.
Top muffin halves with egg mixture and a slice of cheese. Broil until
cheese is melted and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.

NOTE: For this recipe, use only clean eggs with no cracks in shells.

[Karen adds: Because of the risk of salmonella poisoning, it's been
widely recommended that children, the elderly, and immuno-compromised
persons avoid consuming any raw or undercooked eggs.]
