Categories: Breads
Yield: 20 Servings
2    Envelopes dry yeast
1 tb Sugar
1 1/2 c  Warm (105-115 deg.) water
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 ts Salt
3 1/2 c  All purpose flour
1    Egg
1 tb Water
(Makes 20.) Lightly oil baking sheets. Sprinkle yeast and sugar over
1/4 cup warm water in large bowl. Stir to dissolve. Let stand until
foamy, about 5 minutes. Add oil and beat 2 minutes, using wooden
spoon. Stir in salt and 1/2 cup warm water. Alternately stir in 3
cups flour (1 cup at a time) and remaining 3/4 cup warm water,
beating until dough is soft and sticky.

Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup flour on work surface. Turn dough out and
knead until springy and flour is absorbed, about 3 minutes. Cover
dough and let stand 5 minutes. Shape dough into 20-inch cylinder. Cut
into 20 pieces. Let stand 4 minutes. Using palm of hand, roll each
piece into cylinder. Tie into knot. Arrange on prepared sheets,
spacing 1 inch apart. Cover and let stand in warm draft-free area
until starting to rise, 20 to 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 300 deg. Beat egg with 1 tablespoon water for glaze.

Brush over bread knots. Bake until golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Serve
bread knots either warm or at room temperature.
