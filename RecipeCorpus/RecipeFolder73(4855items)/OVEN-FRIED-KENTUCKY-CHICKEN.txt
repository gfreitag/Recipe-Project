Title: OVEN FRIED KENTUCKY CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Cyberealm, Kooknet
Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Self-rising flour
1 tb Paprika
2 pk Lipton Tomato Cup A Soup
-powder
2 pk Good Seasons Italian
-Dressing mix powder
1 ts Seasoned salt
Pam or oil
1/4 lb Margarine or Butter
3 lb Fryer chicken
In doubled plastic food bag combine well the flour, paprika, Lipton
Tomato Cup A Soup powder, Good Seasons Italian Dressing mix powder
and seasoned salt.

Shake the mixture well to combine it in the bag, having twisted the
end the bag tightly until the air inside the bag create an inflated
balloon affect.

Spray a jelly roll pan (10x15x3/4") with Pam or wipe it well with
oil. Run a cut-up chicken fryer under cold water and let excess water
drip off, or put all of the wet pieces of chicken into a colander to
drain a few minutes.

Dredge pieces in the flour mixture, by placing the pieces, one at a
time, in the bag of seasoned flour and shaking it to coat each piece.
Arrange the coated pieces, skin-side up on prepared pan. Melt
margarine or butter and use a 1" wide soft bristled pastry brush (or
one from a paint store with soft hair bristles -- rather than plastic
bristles) and dab the melted margarine over the floured surface --
skin-side only ~- of each piece of chicken.  When all of the melted
margarine has been divided between chicken pieces, bake it uncovered
~- without turning the pieces -- 350 degrees F -- for 1 hour or till
golden brown and tender.

FOR CRISPY COATING:  After applying melted margarine, dust each piece
with a few tablespoons more seasoned flour mixture and dab again in
additional melted margarine before baking.

Serves 4 to 6.
