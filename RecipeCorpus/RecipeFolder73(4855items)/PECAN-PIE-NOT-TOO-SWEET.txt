Title: PECAN PIE NOT TOO SWEET
Categories: Pies
Yield: 1 Servings
3    Eggs; large, lightly beaten
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Corn syrup; dark
1/4 c  Sour cream
2 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/4 c  Pecan halves
1    Pie shell; baked 9"
Preheat oven to 400F. Whisk eggs, sugar and corn syrup together in
large bowl till thoroughly combined. Then vigourously whisk in sour
cream, vanilla and salt and set aside. Place pecans in even layer in
the pastry shell (arrange in shape if you like, rounded side up).
Carefully pour egg mixture over them, don't disturb the pattern.
Transfer the pie to a baking sheet, and place in the bottom of the
oven. Bake the pie for 10 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 350F and
continue baking till filling is set, another 35 minutes. Remove from
oven and let it cool to room temperature on wire rack before serving.
