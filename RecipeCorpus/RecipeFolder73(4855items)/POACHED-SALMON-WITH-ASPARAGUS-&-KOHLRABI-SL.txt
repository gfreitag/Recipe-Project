Trim roots from leeks, leaving bases intact so leeks do not seperate
into layers when cut. Halve leeks lengthwise; wash thoroughly under
running water. Place 2 1/2 quarts water, wine, lemon juice, salt,
peppercorns, oregano and leeks in a large shallow saucepan. Bring to
a boil. Reduce heat to medium low; simmer until very flavorful, about
45 minutes. Meanwhile, slice into one long side of each salmon fillet
about 3/4 of the way through, forming a pocket. Trim tough bottoms
from asparagus; cut each spear in half. Arrange ten asparagus halves
in the pocket of each salmon fillet (parallel to the cut side) in two
rows of five, facing tips toward center. Press gently to close. Tie
kitchen string around salmon in two places, so pocket stays closed
while poaching. Return stock to a boil. Reduce heat so stock is at a
bare simmer. Add salmon and poach, adjusting heat to maintain a bare
simmer, for 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer salmon from stockpot to a glass
or ceramic baking dish. Allow liquid to cool for 5 minutes, then pour
over salmon; let stand until cool, about 1 hour. Remove salmon from
liquid; let stand to come toroom temperature, about 45 minutes. Untie
salmon and slice each fillet widthwise into 1-inch pieces; garnish
with dill sprigs and serve Kohlrabi Slaw on the side.
