ds Garlic salt
1 ts A-1 sauce

that mess into a saucepan along with the pureed spinach. Add the milk,

Mix cornstarch with a little cold water, stir into soup and let

Whip cream, ladle soup into four ovenproof bowls, top each with a
generous portion of cream and put under an oven broiler just until
