Title: ONION MARMALADE I
Categories: Condiment
Yield: 1 Cup
4    Yellow onions (~1.5 lb)
2 tb Butter
2 tb Balsamic vinegar
1 tb Brown sugar
Slice the onions into half rings (looks better than cubes) and cook in
butter over medium heat until they start to caramelize (ie turn brown
on the edges). Then add vinegar and sugar and simmer for 10 minutes.
I've made it with honey, but I think the brown sugar produces a
better flavor.
