Title: OUTRAGEOUS BAKED BEANS
Categories: Bean/legume, Vegetables, Bar-b-q, Crock pot
Yield: 8 Servings
1 ea Green beans
1 ea Pork & beans
1 ea Kidney beans; (all drained
1 ea Chili;  with & without bean
1 x  Green onions; sliced to tas
1 ea Bell pepper; diced
1 c  Chili sauce
2/3 c  Brown sugar
4 oz Bacon; cooked crisp and cru
All 14-16 oz. cans: Put all of the above ingredients in a crock pot or
large pot or dutch oven and bring to a boil for 15 minutes, stirring
every few minutes. Then simmer for at least 2 hrs.,Stirring
occasionally, so mixture doesn't catch & burn. I always make
quadruple this recipe so there will be some left over but there never
is!!! Thanks for requesting this one-I knew that if you tried it,
you'd like. It's always real nice to hear such nice compliments from
others much more experienced than I. I think this is a real nice
alternative to the usual bean fare. Makes 1 1/2 quarts on single
recipe.
