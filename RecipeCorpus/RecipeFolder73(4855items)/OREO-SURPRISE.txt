Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Recipe
1 sm (15 oz.) pkg Oreo cookies
1 c  (8 oz.) margarine, melted
1 c  (8 oz.) confectioner's
-sugar
1    8-oz  pkg cream cheese
2 sm (8 oz.) tubs Cool Whip
2 sm Boxes Jello instant
-chocolate pudding
1. Crush entire package of Oreos to fine consistancy (potato masher
works fine for this). Saving out 1/2 cup of Oreo crumbs for later
use, mix remaining crumbs and melted margarine and press in bottom of
9 X 13 baking pan. Tamp firmly with spoon or spatula. 2. Place in
refrigerator for 5 minutes. 3. In large mixing bowl, combine
confectioner's sugar, cream cheese and one (1) tub of cool whip. Beat
with electric mixer until thoroughly mixed. Note: Items will mix much
more easily if cream cheese and cool whip have been set out at room
temperature ahead of time. 4. Retrieve pan from refrigerator, spread
cream cheese/Cool Whip/sugar mixture evenly over Oreo crust. Spread
carefully, as crust will have tendancy to stick to mixture. Return to
refrigerator. 5. Prepare both boxes of chocolate pudding according to
package directions. Then quickly retrieve pan from refrigerator and
spread over top of previous layer. Return to refrigerator for 5
minutes. 6. Retrieve pan from refrigerator and spread remaining tub
of Cool Whip evenly over pudding layer. 7. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of Oreo
crumbs (set aside earlier) over top of Cool Whip layer. 8.
Refrigerate until served. For best results, make the night before.
