Title: PASTA & SHRIMP
Categories: None
Yield: 2 Servings
1/2 lb Shrimp, shelled and deveined
1/8 c  Olive oil
1    Big clove garlic, chopped
Salt and pepper
1/2 lb Pasta
Before making sauce, start the pasta boiling. Once it starts,heat oil
and garlic over LOW heat. Try to keep it from browning excessively.
When the pasta is almost al dente, throw shrimp into pan with oil,
and turn heat up. Stir often. When cooked, add salt and pepper. Toss
drained pasta with the sauce in the pan and serve. Serves 2
generously. 	It might be nice to add a splash of white wine when the
shrimp are cooking. I added lemon juice. I would have sprinkled with
parsley, but I didn't have any!
