Title: PIZZA POMODORO
Categories: Italian
Yield: 8 Servings
2 ts Dry yeast
1/2 c  Warm water (105-115'F.)
1 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Non-fat milk
2 ts Minced garlic
Salt
3 c  Flour
2 tb Yellow cornmeal
1 1/2 tb Olive oil
5    Thinly sliced Roma tomatoes
2 tb Chopped fresh basil
1/3 c  Shaved Parmesan cheese
Sprinkle yeast over warm water in small bowl. Stir until dissolved.
Stir in sugar. Let stand until mixture begins to bubble. Stir in
milk, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt.

Beat in enough flour to make moderately stiff dough.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and
satiny, 10-12 minutes. Shape into ball and place in lightly greased
bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover and let rise in warm place
until doubled.

Punch dough down. Roll out on lightly floured surface to a 13x9"
rectangle. Place on lightly greased baking sheet sprinkled with
cornmeal. Brush dough with half of oil. Cover with tomato slices
slightly overlapping in rows. Brush tomatoes with remaining oil.
Season tomatoes to taste with salt and pepper.

Bake at 350'F. 20-25 minutes or until edges of pizza dough are
browned. Sprinkle with fresh basil and cheese. Cut into 2x4" pieces.
