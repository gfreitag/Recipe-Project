Title: PEPPERED ROUND STEAK
Categories: Meats, Sauces
Yield: 4 Servings
1/3 c  Olive Oil
1 1/2 lb Top Round Steak; Cut 1 1/2
Inches Thick (Up To 2 lb
Can Be Used)
2 tb Balsamic Or Red Wine Vinegar
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
MMMMM-----------------------SHALLOT CREAM----------------------------
2 tb Marinade For Peppered Round
Steak
1 tb Shallots; Minced
1 c  Heavy (Whipping) Cream
Salt And Coarsely Ground
Black Pepper
Heat the oil until very warm but not sizzling.  Place the meat in a
shallow dish and pierce all over with a fork. Turn and pierce the
other side. Pour half the warm oil on the meat and poke with a fork
so that the oil penetrates the meat fibers.  Turn and repeat the
process on the other side. Pour the vinegar over the steak and turn.
Cover and marinate, at room temperature, about 2 hours or overnight
in the refrigerator, piercing and turning the meat occasionally.
Remove the meat, reserve the marinade, and sprinkle the pepper over
the meat generously, pressing it in with the heel of your hand. Grill
the meat 3-inches above the hot coals until browned then turn and
grill the other side. Move to the edge of the grill and continue
cooking until done as desired. This steak is the tenderest if grilled
to rare, about 18 minutes to total cooking time or medium-rare, about
22 minutes. Place on a warm platter and slice across the grain. Serve
with the Shallot Cream, if desired.

SHALLOT CREAM:

In a small skillet, heat the marinade.  Stir in the shallots and cook
until lightly browned.  Stir in the cream and cook, stirring often,
until slightly reduced. Season to taste with the salt and pepper.
Serve with the steak.
