Gazette, 91/01/09. The Pizzalini restaurant is owned by Spiro
Maltezos. With his Hobart mixer running very slowly, Maltezos allows
one hour to make the dressing. "A tiny hole punched in a can lets the
vegetable oil drip into the eggs at a suitable rate," he said. The
restaurant is located at 4805 Sources in Pierrefond (Montreal).
