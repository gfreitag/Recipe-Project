1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Grease a 10-inch springform pan.

2. For pear and streusel topping, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large
skillet over high heat. Add pears; cook, stirring often, until they
are tender and browned at the edges, 6 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle 2
tablespoons of the sugar over, cook 1 more minute, then remove from
heat; set aside.

3. Crush cookies into coarse crumbs in a food processor or with a
rolling pin.  Add 3 tablespoons sugar and 2 tablespoons flour; mix
well. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and mix with processor or a
pastry blender until butter is the size of small peas; set aside.

4. For cake, beat  1/2 cup butter and the sugar with an electric
mixer on high speed until light. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well
after each addition.  Pour in cream and vanilla; mix well. Stop mixer
and add flour, baking soda and salt; fold in gently.

5. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Arrange pears in a spoke design
on top; sprinkle with crumb mixture. Bake until a toothpick inserted
in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool at least 15
minutes before serving.
