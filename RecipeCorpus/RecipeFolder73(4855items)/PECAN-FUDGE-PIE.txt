whisk together the eggs and sugar, then whisk in the flour,
evaporated milk, vanilla, corn syrup, chocolate, salt, and pecans.
Pour the filling into the pie shell and bake the pie in the middle of
a preheated 350F degree oven for 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes, or
until the filling is just set and cracks appear on the surface.  Let
the pie cool on a rack and serve it with whipped cream.
