Title: PAPAS FRITAS CON RAJAS (POTATOES FRIED WITH C
Categories: Mexican, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
8    Chiles poblanos; roasted and
2 tb Peanut oil
1 1/2 md Onions; thinly sliced
1 ts Salt
2 lb Red bliss or other waxy pota
This is an excellent accompaniment for roasted and broiled meats,
especially if you want something more substantial than the rajas
alone.

I shall never forget the wonderful smell of the chiles frying as we
would walk in very hungry at lunch time. Sometimes our maid Rufina
would use strips of the long, thin, dark green chile chilaca, which
can bite your stomach as well as your mouth quite fiercely.

Cook the potatoes but be careful not to cook them too much; they
should be al dente, or they will disintegrate during the frying.

Remove the seeds and veins from the chiles and cut them into strips
about 1 1/2 inhes long and 1/2 inch wide. If the chiles seem too
picante, soak them in salted water for about 30 minutes.

Heat the oil and fry the onions gently, without browning them, until
they are soft.

Add the chile strips, potatoes, and salt to the onions in the pan.
Without coverint the pan, fry the potatoes until theyare nicely
browned, stirring the mixture from time to time, as the chile and
onions are apt to stick to the bottom of the pan.
