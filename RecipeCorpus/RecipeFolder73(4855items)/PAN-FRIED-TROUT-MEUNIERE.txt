Title: PAN-FRIED TROUT MEUNIERE
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
6    10-oz trout, cleaned but
With heads left on
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
1/4 c  Corn or vegetable oil
8 tb Unsalted butter
6    Lemon slices
Juice of 1 lemon
4 tb Finely chopped parsley
Leaves
Place the trout in a large pan and pour in the milk. Turn the trout
in the milk. Spread the flour over a flat dish and season it well
with salt and pepper. Remove the trout from the milk and dredge them
well in the flour, shaking off any excess flour.

Heat the oil in a heavy nonstick frying pan or black steel pan over
medium-high heat and add the trout. Cook until golden brown, about 6
minutes on each side. Baste often to keep the trout moist.

Remove the trout to a warm platter.  Pour off the fat from the
frying pan and wipe it clean with paper towels. Return the pan to the
heat and melt the butter, shaking the pan and stirring until it turns
hazlenut brown. Do not let it burn.  Place a lemon slice atop each
trout. Sprinkle them with the lemon juice then pour the butter over
them. Garnish with the chopped parsley and serve immediately.
