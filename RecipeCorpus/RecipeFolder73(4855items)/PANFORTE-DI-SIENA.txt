MMMMM------------------FOR DUSTING THE PANFORTE-----------------------
Confectioner's sugar
Preheat the oven to 300º F. Sift flour with cocoa, cinnamon, and
allspice. Mix in nuts and fruit. Set aside. Combine honey and sugar
in a large saucepan. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring
constantly with a wooden spoon. Syrup should register 238º F. on a
candy thermometer, or a bit dropped in cold water should form a soft
ball. Remove from heat. Add flour mixture and blend well. Pour into a
well-greased 9-inch pie plate or a spring-form cake pan. Smooth
surface with a wet knife. Bake in a preheated 300º F. oven for 30
minutes, or until firm. Remove from oven, sprinkle top with
confectioners' sugar, and cool on a cake rack. When cake is cool,
remove from pan and dust all sides with a thick coating of
confectioners' sugar. Cut into wedges to serve.

NOTES : Panforte has been made in Italy since the Middle Ages and is
traditionally eaten at Christmas. This cake will keep indefinitely if
wrapped well in foil or waxed paper and kept in an airtight container.
