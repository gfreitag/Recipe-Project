Title: PICKLED PIGS' EARS (TAI HEO NGAM CHUA)
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
4 qt Water
1 tb Alum
2 c  Distilled white vinegar
2 c  Granulated sugar
1 ts Salt
2 lb Pigs' ears
Lip-smacking, tangy, chewy, and exotic, these morsels go perfectly
with drinks before dinner, and very well without drinks at any time.

Boil 2 quarts of the water with the alum for 5 minutes, then remove
from the heat and allow to cool.

Boil the vinegar with the sugar and salt for a few minutes, or until
the sugar is completely dissolved. Remove from the heat and cool.

Boil the remaining 2 quarts water and drop in the pigs' ears. Boil
for 20 minutes. Remove the pigs' ears and cut them into lengthwise
slices 1/4 inch wide. After the sliced pigs' ears have cooled, return
them to the alum water to soak for 2 hours, then drain and rinse
under cold water. Dry lightly.

Place the pigs' ears in a jar, pressing them down. Pour in enough
cooled vinegar mixture to completely cover the contents of the jar.
Refrigerate.

NOTE: This can be eaten after 3 day and will keep for several weeks
in the refrigerator.

Yields 2 quarts
