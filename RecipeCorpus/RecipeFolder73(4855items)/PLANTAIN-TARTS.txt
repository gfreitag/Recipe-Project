Categories: Desserts, Ethnic, Jamaiican, Posted/may
Yield: 8 Servings
3    Very ripe, black plantain
1/2 c  Sugar plus more for garnish
1/4 ts To 1/2 ground nutmeg
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
Red food coloring

Peel the plantains.  Put them in a saucepan, cover them with water,
and boil until very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash until
smooth. Stir in 1/2 c sugar and the nutmeg, vanilla and a drop or 2
of red food coloring (opt).

Preheat oven to 400 degrees, Roll out pie dough and cut into 8
circles that are 4-5 inches across (use a saucer or small plate as a
guide). Divide the plantain mixture among the 8 dough circles,
placing it on side and leaving a 1/2 inch border. Fold the other half
of the circle over the filling to form a crescent shape. Crimp the
edges with a fork to seal well. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake on an
ungreased baking sheet for 30-45 minutes, until lightly browned.
Cool on wire racks, and serve warm or cold.
