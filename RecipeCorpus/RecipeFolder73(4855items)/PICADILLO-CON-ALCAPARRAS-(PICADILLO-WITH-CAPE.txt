Categories: Spanish, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 lb Ground beef
-- (chuck or top round)
1 sm Onion; finely chopped
1 lg Ripe tomato; peeled, seeded,
-- and finely chopped
1    Garlic clove; minced
1    Bay leaf
1 ts Crushed oregano
3 oz Bottled capers
8    Pimiento-stuffed olives

3 tb Tomato sauce
1/4 c  Burgandy wine
2 dr Hot sauce (more to taste)
1/2 ts Brown sugar
1 ds Nutmeg
1/4 c  Water
Salt if needed
Use a large skillet with cover. Heat olive oil and brown beef in hot
oil until red of meat disappears. Combine onion, green pepper,
tomato, garlic, bay leaf, crushed oregano, and capers. Add to meat in
skillet. Mix well and cook covered for about 10 minutes on moderate
heat. Cut olives into thin rounds.  Add to the meat mixture together
with the vinegar, tomato sauce, burgandy wine, hot sauce, sugar, and
nutmeg. Stir well and cook 5 minutes, uncovered.  Now add the water
and mix well. Correct seasoning. If salt is needed, add it at this
point (the salt released from the olives may be sufficient for your
taste). Cover the skillet and cook at low heat for approximately 30
minutes, or until most of the liquid is absorbed. If the liquid is
not absorbed sufficiently at the end of 30 minutes, cook uncovered
until liquid evaporates. Serve over long grain white rice and ripe
fried plantains if available.
