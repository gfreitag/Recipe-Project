Title: ORANGE GINGER BEEF
Categories: Chinese, Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Shao Hsing wine
2 ts Cornstarch
2 ts Vegetable oil
3/4 lb Beef steak, thinly sliced
Orange Sauce:
1/4 c  Thawed undiluted frozen
Orange juice concentrate
1 tb Sugar
1 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Vegetable oil
5    Thin slices fresh ginger
1 ts Cornstarch mixed with water
Marinade:
Orange slices for garnish
Place a wok or wide frying pan over high heat until hot. Add oil,
swirling to coat sides. Add ginger slices and cook, stirring, until
fragrant, about 5 seconds. Add beef and stir-fry for 2 minutes or
until barely pink. Add sauce and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add
cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until sauce boils and
thickens. Garnish with orange slices.

[Personal note: this would probably be quite pretty with thin orange
peel curls, rather than, or in addition to, orange slices.]
