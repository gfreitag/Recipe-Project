A national noodle dish of Thailand. It is now served in many trendy
restaurants. It is a personal dish - you can add ingredients that you
like, and make it as spicy or tart as you wish. Can be used as a
basis for a stir fry of leftovers. Rice noodles are available at most
ethnic Asian and gourmet stores.

Soak noodles in warm water for 20 minutes, drain and reserve.

Combine fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, ketchup and chili flakes.
Reserve

Heat a wok or large skillet on high heat and add oil. Stir in garlic,
cook 10 seconds, then add shrimp and chicken.

Stir fry until all ingredients are cooked, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add
eggs and toss together until scrambled.

Add noodles to the wok. Mix well to combine all ingredients. Pour in
reserved sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, until noodles are soft and
tender. If they appear dry, add up to 1/4 cup water.

Stir in bean sprouts, green onions and peanuts, and fry for one more
minute. Taste for seasoning, adding more lime or chili as needed.

Serve Pad Thai garnished with coriander, lime wedges, bean sprouts and
optional chilies.
