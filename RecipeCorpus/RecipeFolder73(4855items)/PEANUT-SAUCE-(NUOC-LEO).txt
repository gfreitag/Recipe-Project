Title: PEANUT SAUCE (NUOC LEO)
Categories: Sauces, Nuts, Asian, Vietnamese
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Cloves garlic, chopped
2    Chicken livers
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 tb Dark soy sauce
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Crunchy peanut butter
2 ts Sesame paste
1/4    Red chilli, seeded & chopped
Water
Saute the garlic and chicken livers in the oil until very darkly
coloured. Grind to a thick paste and return to the pan with the
remaining ingredients. Simmer, adding water to make a thick sauce,
for about 2 mins, stirring constantly. Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.
Use as a dip for various roasted meats and meatballs and to spread
over rice paper before wrapping cooked ingredients or salad.  A
variation to this sauce uses tamarind pulp instead of the livers to
give a tart tasting sauce.
