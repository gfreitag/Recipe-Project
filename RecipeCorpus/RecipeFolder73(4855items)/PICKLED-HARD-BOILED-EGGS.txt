Hard boiled eggs
Really good pickle juice
One of the best uses of pickle juice is to refill the pickle jar with
peeled hard boiled eggs and let them stay in the pickle juice for as
long as you can stand to wait. Cauliflower that has been cooked just
slightly and added hot to the pickle juice is also good.

Pickle juice is also good poured over hot potato chunks before making
potato salad. Don't throw out Clausen's pickle juice until it's all
used up!
