Time: 1:30 Peel the eggplants (optional) and slice them crosswise
1/2" thick, then cut into quarters. Arrange the slices in a shallow
dish. Combine the vinegar, water and salt, stirring well to dissolve
the salt, and pour over the eggplant slices.  Let stand for one hour,
then remove the eggplant slices from the solution and pat dry with
paper toweling. Heat oil in a wok to a depth of two inches until very
hot (375 F). Deep-fry the eggplant slices, a few at a time, until
light brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper toweling.
To make the sauce, combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan,
bring to a gentle boil and simmer, stirring frequently, until the
sauce thickens slightly. Arrange the eggplant slices in a shallow
dish and pour the sauce over them.
