Categories: Low-fat, Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Oil
1/3 c  Chopped onions
1 c  Unbleached flour
1 c  Yellow cornmeal
1 tb Baking powder
1/4 ts Ground black pepper
1 c  Skim milk
1    Egg white
Preheat the oven to 400 F.  Evenly coat an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with
no-stick spray.

Heat the oil in a small frying pan over medium-low heat; add the
onions and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Set
aside.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, baking powder and
pepper. In a measuring cup, whisk the milk, egg white and cooked
onions together. Add to the dry ingredients all at once. Stir just to
blend.

Spread in the prepared pan.  Bake until the bread's sides begin to
pull away from the pan, about 20 minutes. Cool before loosening the
sides and turning out from the pan. Divide into 6 squares.
