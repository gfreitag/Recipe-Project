Title: PEAR MARMALADE
Categories: Preserves
Yield: 1 Servings
10 lb Pears
10 lb Sugar
6    Oranges
3    Lemons
Chopped walnuts & maraschino
Cherries (if desired)
Cut pears in medium-sized pieces, mix with sugar and let stand till
some juice forms.  Boil down till it starts to thicken slightly.
Squeeze juice from oranges and lemons. Slice oranges and lemon skins
thinly or put through grinder.  Steam skins till tender and add to
pears along with juice.  Continue boiling till of desired thickness.
(Marmalade is more apt to stick during this second boiling so boil
pears away sufficiently before adding oranges and lemons.) Add
chopped walnuts and cherries just before sealing if desired. Source:
