slicing. Cut tenderloin into 1/2-inch thick slices and serve with
warm Cranberry-Jalapeno Sauce (recipe below).

Warm Cranberry-Jalapeno Sauce: Prepare peppers by broiling 3-4 inches
from heat on a baking sheet, turning frequently, until skin bubbles
and is evenly charred. Transfer to a sealable plastic bag; close and
set aside until peppers cool. Peel charred skin from peppers. Remove
seeds. To make sauce, blend cranberries, orange juice and sugar in
food processor for 30-45 seconds. Transfer to saute pan and add
remaining ingredients. Stir to mix and let ingredients stand at least
30 min. for flavors to combine. Warm sauce over low heat before
serving. Do not boil. Salt to taste. Serve sauce with sliced, roasted
tenderloin or sirloin. Yields: 1 1/2-2 cups.
