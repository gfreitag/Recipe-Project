Info
Because the number of ingredients and directions lines exceeds
the limits of the Meal Master program, I've taken the liberty of
splitting up this recipe into three parts.  Please capture all three
parts before attempting to cook this recipe or you'll find yourself
in a quandary at some point!  ;-) :

Pappardelle I (Pasta)
Pappardelle II (Duck)
Pappardelle III (Assembly)
