Title: ONION-OAT SOUP
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Bowls
1 c  Thinly sliced onions
2/3 c  Thinly sliced carrots
2 1/2 c  Low-fat or fat-free chicken
-or vegetable stock,or water
1/2 ts Dried chives
1/2 ts Dried mixed herbs
ds Salt
Lots of ground pepper
1/4 c  Quick oats
2/3 c  Evaporated skimmed milk
Bring the stock or water to a boil in a good-sized saucepan or small
Dutch oven.  Add the onions, carrots, chives, mixed herbs, salt and
pepper. Lower the heat and simmer 15 minutes or until the carrots are
tender. Sprinkle in oats, add milk, and cook gently, uncovered, for 5
minutes. Serve very hot.

This makes enough to fill four of my favorite soup bowls exactly.
