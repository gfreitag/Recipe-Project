Cook all of the beans in two quarts of water until tender; drain and
reserve the fluid.  Put half of the beans through a food mill,
putting the pulp back into the reserved fluid and discarding the
skins. Meanwhile, saute onion until transparent in olive oil; add
chopped parsley and garlic slices and add to the bean pulp and wat
mixture. Add more water if necessary and season with salt and pepper
to taste. Add the raw macaroni and cook until tender.  Then add
remaining cooked beans and heat through. The consistency should now
be of a hearty soup. Serve piping hot drizzling olive oil on top of
each bowl. A sprinkling of fresh grated Locatelli cheese is optional,
but adds delicious flavor. A wonderful dinner when served with a
crispy green salad, crusty Italian bread, and a bottle of your
