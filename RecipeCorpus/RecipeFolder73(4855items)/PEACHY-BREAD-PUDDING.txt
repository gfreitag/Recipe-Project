Title: PEACHY BREAD PUDDING
Categories: Desserts, Low-fat
Yield: 10 Servings
1    Loaf French bread, cut into
-1 inch cubes
1    16-ounce can light sliced
-peaches, drained
1/2 c  Raisins
2    Eggs
2    Egg whites
3/4 c  Sugar
1    12-ounce can evaporated skim
-milk
2 c  Skim milk
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1 ts Butter flavoring
1 ts Coconut flavoring
1 tb Vanilla
Preheat oven to 350'F.

Place bread cubes in a 3-quart baking dish. (I spray with Pam first).
Add peaches and raisins to bread, mixing gently. In a bowl, combine
eggs and egg whites with sugar and mix well. Add evaporated milk,
skim milk, spices and flavorings, and blend well.

Pour egg mixture evenly over bread, and press bread with fork so it
will soak up liquid (I use my hands). Bake for 30 to 40 minutes.
Insert knife near center; if it comes out clean, its done.

Sauce

2 Tablespoons light margarine 2 Tablespoons flour
1 1/3    cup skim milk 1 Tablespoon rum flavoring

Melt margarine in a small saucepan and add flour and sugar, mixing
well. Add milk, stirring constantly. Cook until mixture comes to a
boil; boil 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in flavoring. Serve
over hot bread pudding.

carbohydrate, 16% protein. by Holly Berkowitz Clegg This stores well
in the fridge and reheats well in the microwave. I would not suggest
freezing, as it is a custard.

A double batch of this can be made in those turkey roaster pans.
Reheat at 300'F for 20 minutes. We made this for our Garden Club
Christmas Boutique that served 300, and everyone loved it.
