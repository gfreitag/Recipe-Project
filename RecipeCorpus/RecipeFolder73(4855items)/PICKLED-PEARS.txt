Any good preserving pear may be used. Slice and remove core or pickle
whole; the latter method is preferred when Sickel pears are used. Peel
pears. Put spices in a small cheese cloth bag and add to the vinegar
and sugar and bring to a boil. Add pears and cook until tender. The
pears will look clear when tender. Remove them with a spoon and place
them in sterilized jars. Boil the syrup until it becomes thick, the
pour it over pears and seal. Source:  Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book -
