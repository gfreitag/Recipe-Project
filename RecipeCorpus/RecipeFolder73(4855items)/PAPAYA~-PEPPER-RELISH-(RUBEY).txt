NOTES : Mangoes can be substituted for papayas; zucchini or cucumber
can be substituted for green bell pepper; jarred, roasted red peppers
can be substituted for fresh -- improvise with this; it is hard to go
wrong. Just be sure to make a lot. This relish provides a welcome
color accent, but it also contributes needed carbohydrates. Recipe By
