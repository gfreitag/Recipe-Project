Melt the butter in a large non-reactive saucepan.  Add the onions and

8 minutes. Add the potatoes, fennel, carrot, fish stock and
half-and-half, reduce heat to moderately-low and simmer gently until
the vegetables are tender, about
15    minutes.

Strain the stew into a bowl; set aside 1 1/2 cups of the vegetables.
Transfer the remaining vegetables along with 2 cups of the liquid to a
blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Return the puree to
the saucepan and stir in the reserved vegtables and liquid. (Make

In a medium skillet, cook the bacon over moderately-high heat until
browned and crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.

Rewarm the stew over moderate heat.  Add the oysters with their
liquor and the bacon and cook until the oysters are just firm, 2 to 3
minutes. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the parsley.
Transfer to shallow soup plates and serve at once.
