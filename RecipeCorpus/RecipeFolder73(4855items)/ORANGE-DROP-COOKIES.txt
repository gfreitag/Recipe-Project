4 c  Powdered Sugar
1/3 c  Evaporated Milk

Cream shortening and sugar.  Add eggs, orange juice, rinds, vanilla
and sour milk.  Mix well.  Add all dry ingredients which have been
sifted (NOT! I'm lazy) together. Blend everything together well.
Optional - one cup of nuts. Drop by teaspoon on greased cookie sheet,
(I used teflon cookie sheet - no greasing) Bake at 350% for 5 to 8
minutes.

ICING: Beat it all together and slap on the VERY COOLED DOWN cookies.

This makes a cake like cookie just exploding with orange flavor
