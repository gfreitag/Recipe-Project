Title: PEG'S MANY BEAN SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Mixed Beans, dried
1    Chopped onion
2    Chopped green peppers
3    Grated carrots
1 sm Bunch Celery, finely diced
1 lb Diced pork (chop suey pork)
1 lb Jimmy Dean Sausage (hot)
1    Grated potato
1 tb Sweet basil, dried
1 tb Ground sage
1 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
1    Dash Red pepper
1 qt Chicken Stock, thereabouts
Presoak (8 hrs) or preboil (1 hr) beans, drain and rinse. Add chicken
stock to soup pot and add beans. Turn heat on low. Add all
ingredients just like that. Do not precook meat. The grated potato
thickens the broth, another favorite thickener may be used, I prefer
the potato. Simmer this soup for 2 hours before serving. I probably
add more basil than listed, do that to taste.  Go easy on the sage
but it is quite important. You may add a tablespoon of sugar to perk
this soup up a bit, I do not recall off hand if I did or not. Another
ingredient to perk it up is a tablespoon of vinegar--don't overdo.
