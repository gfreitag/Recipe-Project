This rice salad is for special occasions - a lovely mixture of
pineapple, cucumber, spring onions and radishes mingles with the
rice, and all are dressed in a minty yogurt dressing.

To make the dressing, in a bowl combine the yogurt, sour cream, mint,
garam masala, and salt and pepper to taste.

In another bowl combine the rice, pineapple, cucumber, spring onion
and radishes, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Toss the
salad with the dressing and let it stand, covered, for 30 minutes.
Line a platter with the lettuce and mound the rice salad into the
centre.
