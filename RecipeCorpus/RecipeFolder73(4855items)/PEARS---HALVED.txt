Title: PEARS - HALVED
Categories: Fruits, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 17-1/2 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 11 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
A bushel weighs 50 pounds and yields 16 to 25 quarts--an average of
2-1/2 pounds per quart.

Quality: Choose ripe, mature fruit of ideal quality for eating fresh
or cooking.

Procedure: Wash and peel pears. Cut lengthwise in halves and remove
core. A melon baller or metal measuring spoon is suitable for coring
pears. To prevent discoloration, keep pears in an ascorbic acid
solution. Prepare a very light, light, or medium syrup or pack pears
in apple juice, white grape juice, or water. Raw packs make poor
quality pears. Boil drained pears 5 minutes in syrup, juice, or
water. Fill jars with hot fruit and cooking liquid, leaving 1/2-inch
headspace. Adjust lids and process. Processing directions for canning
pears in a boiling-water, a dial, or a weighted-gauge canner are
given in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.
