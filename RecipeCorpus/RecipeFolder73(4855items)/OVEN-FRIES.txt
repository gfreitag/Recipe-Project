2 ts Olive oil
1/2 ts Salt

Freshly ground black pepper

Much lower in fat than their deep-fried cousins.

Set oven rack on the upper level; preheat to 450 degrees F. Coat a
baking sheet lightly with a non-stick cooking spray. Cut each potato
lengthwise into 8 wedges.

In a large bowl, combine olive oil, salt, paprika and pep- per. Add
potato wedges and toss to coat. Spread the potatoes on the prepared
baking sheet and roast 20 minutes. Loosen and turn the potatoes;
roast 10 to 15 minutes longer, or until golden brown.
