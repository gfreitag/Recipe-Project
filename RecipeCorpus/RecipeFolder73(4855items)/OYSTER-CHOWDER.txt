Title: OYSTER CHOWDER
Categories: Soups, Seafood
Yield: 2 Servings
4 oz Bacon, diced
1 c  Onions, diced
1 1/2 c  Mushrooms, sliced
1 1/2 c  Medium dry sherry
4    Cloves garlic, minced
2 1/2 c  Clam juice
3 c  Milk
1 tb Cornstarch (optional, for
-thickening)
1 c  Scallions
1    Juice of lemon
Cayenne
Salt to taste
1 c  Oysters
Cornbread, sliced
Saute the chopped bacon over medium heat in a saucepan large enough
to hold the entire soup. When the bacon is browned, remove the excess
grease and add the onions, mushrooms, sherry and garlic. Simmer
together until sherry is almost gone. Add the clam juice and bring to
a simmer.  Let mixture reduce by half. Then add the milk and bring to
a simmer.  Let the soup simmer together about ten minutes. You can
hold this over a hot water bath until ready for serving.  About three
minutes before serving, add the oysters, scallions and lemon juice.
Season with cayenne and salt, serve over a slice of cornbread in a
large soup bowl.  Garnish the top with a few chopped scallions if
desired. Source: Food & Wine the Westin Way Chef Jamie Morningstar,
