1 c  Heavy cream
1/4 c  Vodka
1/4 ts Dried crushed red pepper
1 lb Penne pasta

Drain, seed and chop the tomatoes.  Melt butter with oil in heavy
large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and saute until
translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook until almost no
liquid remains in pan, stirring frequently, about 25 minutes.  Add

large bowl.  Bring sauce to a simmer. Pour over pasta and toss well.
Sprinkle with Parmesan and chives and serve.
