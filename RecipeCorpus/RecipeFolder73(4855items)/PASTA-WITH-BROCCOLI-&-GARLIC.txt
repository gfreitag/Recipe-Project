Title: PASTA WITH BROCCOLI & GARLIC
Categories: Pasta, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
1 bn Broccoli; trimmed & cut into
-florets
1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil
1/2 c  Butter, unsalted
6 lg Garlic clove; sliced paper
-thin
2 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
1 lb Orecchi; cooked
Cook broccoli to desired tenderness in lightly salted boiling water.
RESERVE 1 CUP of BROCCOLI COOKING WATER. Drain remaining water from
broccoli and cut into bite-size chunks; set aside.

In a medium size saucepan; heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic
slices and stir until lightly and evenly browned. (At this point, you
can remove and dicard the garlic, but I always leave it in!) Add the
butter, stirring until melted.  Add red pepper flakes and simmer 3
minutes. Add the reserved broccoli water and simmer another minute.
Turn off heat and stir in broccoli. Cover and set aside while cooking
pasta.

Place cooked pasta into large bowl.  Pour broccoli sauce over pasta.
Toss to coat and serve with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and black
pepper. YUM.

This recipe is really yummy, don't really know where it came from -
my Mom made it for years and I just modified it by adding the crushed
red pepper flakes. It's quick and easy - and even people that don't
like broccoli, like this pasta recipe!
