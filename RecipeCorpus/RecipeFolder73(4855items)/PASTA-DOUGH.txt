Title: PASTA DOUGH
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Semolina flour
Unbleached flour can be
Substituted
But the quality will suffer
1 ts Salt
3    Eggs
Heavy cream -- as needed
Place the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse to mix. Add
the eggs and pusle again. Add enough heavy cream to make the dough
form a ball, don't add to much or it will become sticky. Knead by
hand for a few minutes, shape into a ball, place in a floured bowl
and let rest for 1/2 hour. Divide the dough into manageable amounts
and run thru a pasta machine to desired thickness. Let the dough rest
again for another 1/2 hour before trying to cut with a pasta machine.
It makes the cutting go a lot smoother. The time here depends on the
thickness of the pasta and the weather(humid or not) Cook in 5 quarts
of water with 1/2 teaspoon added for 1 to 2 minutes or until al
dante. Can also be dried or frozen for later use.

Any herbs or spices can be added with the flour and salt at the
beginning. Quantities here are by personal preference.
