6 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 c  Sugar
3/4 c  White wine vinegar

In a small bowl let the raisins soak in 2 cups hot water for 10
minutes. SAVE THE LIQUID

In a large heavy saucepan cook the onions in the butter over moderate
heat, stirring, until they are coated well with the butter, add the
sugar and 1 Tablespoon of the vinegar, and cook the mixture,
stirring, until the sugar is dissolved and turns a golden caramel.

Add the remaining 11 Tablespoons vinegar and the wine and boil the
mixture for 2 minutes.

Add the raisins with the soaking liquid, the garlic, the thyme, the
salt, and 1 cup water, or enough to just cover the solids, bring the
liquid to a boil, and simmer the onions covered, for 1 hour, or until
they are tender.

Add the cranberries and boil the mixture, uncovered, stirring
occasionally, for 15 to 30 minutes or until the liquid is reduced and
the confit is thickened. Season the confit with salt, transfer it to
a bowl, and let it cool.

The confit may be made up to 3 days in advance and kept covered and
chilled.  Reheat the confit in a saucepan over low heat, stirring,
until the butter is just melted. Serve the confit at room
temperature. Makes about 4 cups.
