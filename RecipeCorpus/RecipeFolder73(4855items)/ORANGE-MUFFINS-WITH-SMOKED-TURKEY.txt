1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Unsalted butter
2    Eggs
1 ts Baking soda
1 c  Buttermilk
2 c  Flour, sifted, all-purpose
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Raisins

1/2 c  Sugar

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Butter mini-muffin tins. Cream 1 cup
sugar and butter until smooth. Add eggs and beat until fluffy. Add
baking soda to buttermilk. Sift flour and salt together and add to
sugar-butter mixture alternately with buttermilk. Stir until well
mixed. In food processor, grind raisins and orange zest. Add to
batter and mix. Spoon batter into buttered muffin tins and bake until
golden brown and firm to touch, about 12 minutes. Remove tins to rack
and set close together. Brush tops of muffins with orange juice and
sprinkle with remaining 1/2 c sugar while still warm. After five
minutes, turn out from pans. Cool completely before cutting each
muffin in half. Cut turkey into small pieces and put a small amount
on each muffin bottom. Top turkey with 1/2 tsp quince jelly, cover
with muffin top, and serve. Formatted by Theresa Grant, HWWK11B, from
