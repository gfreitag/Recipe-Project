Lots of oriental vegetables and an interesting blend of seasonings
give this light and healthy scallop stir-fry its exotic flavor.

STIR-FRY BROCCOLI and onion 3 to 4 minutes in oil in wok or large
skillet. Add scallops, cabbage, snow peas, mushrooms, garlic, anise
and coriander; stir-fry 2 to 3 minutes.

ADD CHICKEN BROTH, vinegar and soy sauce; heat to boiling. Reduce
heat and simmer, uncovered, until scallops are cooked and vegeta-
bles are tender, about
5    minutes. Heat to boiling.

MIX CORNSTARCH AND COLD WATER. Stir cornstarch mixture into boiling
mixture; boil, stirring constantly, until thickened. Remove from
heat; let stand 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in NutraSweet Spoonful; serve
over rice.

NOTE: 2 teaspoons five-spice powder can be substituted for the star
anise and Coriander; amounts of vinegar and soy sauce may need to be
adjusted to taste.
