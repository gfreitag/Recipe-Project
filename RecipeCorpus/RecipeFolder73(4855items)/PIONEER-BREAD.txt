Food processor recipe ...

Makes 1 loaf

Vegetable oil or melted butter or margarine

Combine 1/4 cup of the water, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and yeast.
Stir to dissolve yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes.
Blend egg and butter into yeast mixture.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, cornmeal and salt
into work bowl.  Process on/off to mix.

Add yeast mixture to flour mixture.  Process until blended, about 10
seconds.

Turn on processor and very slowly drizzle just enough remaining water
through feed tube into flour mixture so dough forms a ball that
cleans the sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl
about 25 times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining water to
make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lightly greased surface.  Shape into ball and place in
lightly greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover loosely with
plastic wrap and let stand in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough.  Shape into loaf and place in greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2
x 2 1/2 inch loaf pan.  Brush with oil. Let stand in warm place until
doubled, about 1 hour.

Heat oven to 400 F.  Bake until golden and loaf sounds hollow when
tapped, 25 - 30 minutes.

Remove immediately from pan.  Brush crust with oil, if desired. Cool
on wire rack.
