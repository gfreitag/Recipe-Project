Title: PINK CRUSTACEAN CHEESE BISCUITS - RED LOBSTER
Categories: Bread quick
Yield: 1 Servings  1/4 ts Garlic salt or powder 1/4 tb Parsley flakes 1/4 ts Italian
seasonings 1 lb Bisquick 8 3/4 oz Cold water 1/4 lb Cheddar cheese,
~sharp,grated 1/8 c Butter or margarine

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
with garlic powder, parsley flakes and italian seasoning. (Amounts
will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
Serve hot.

The Red Lobster manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll
have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you
desire. Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick, 1/2
cup cold water, and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will yield about 12
biscuits.

You may also substitute soda water or gingerale for the water, if
desired.
