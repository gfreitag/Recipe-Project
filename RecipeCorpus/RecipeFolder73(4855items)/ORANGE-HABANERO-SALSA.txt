Title: ORANGE HABANERO SALSA
Categories: Chile-heads, Salsa
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Habanero (to have medium
Heat - add more
If you like)
2    Carrots
3    Cloves garlic
1/4 c  Water
2 tb Chopped white onion
1 ts Salt
3 tb Freshly squeezed lemon
Juice
1/4 c  Ginger pickle juice (or
Substitute fresh -- 1 tsp.
Sugar
Ginger and a little water)
1 ts Sugar
1/2    Orange zestted
I steamed the carrots and garlic with water until soft in the
microwave. (You could use them raw for a sharper flavour and
crunchier texture.) Put everything in the blender and pureed till
smooth. Adjust flavours. (More lemon or salt might be good.) It was
delicious as a thick condiment with my pasta with pesto, and also a
great topping on a cold potato salad today. The sauce thickened
overnight in the refrigerator, and I suspect it will keep for about a
week. It's such a beautiful, bright orange colour! Katrine Kirk
