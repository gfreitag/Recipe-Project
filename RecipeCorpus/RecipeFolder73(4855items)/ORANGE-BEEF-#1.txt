Cut the partially frozen steak across the grain into paper-thin slices
about 1 1/2 inches long and 1 inch wide. In a medium bowl, combine 1
tablespoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon sugar. Add the beef slices and
toss to coat.  Mix in the egg white, then add 1 tablespoon of the
cornstarch, mixing with fingers to distribute evenly.

In a wok or 10-inch skillet, heat the oil over high heat until hot.
Add the beef and stri-fry until the meat just loses its redness,
about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a dish.

In the oil remaining in the wok, stir-fry the orange peel over medium
heat for 2 to 3 minutes to soften. Mix in the chili paste, orange
juice concentrate, the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, the
remaining 1/4 cup sugar, the ketchup, 1/4 cup water, and the orange
extract. Heat to boiling. Dissolve the remaining 1 tablespoon
cornstarch in the remaining 1 tablespoon water and add to the wok.
Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce boils and thickens, 1 to 2
minutes.

Return the beef to the wok and heat through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve
over hot cooked rice, garnished with parsley and orange slices, if
desired.
