Salt and pepper, to taste
4    Pork chops, 3/4 to 1-inch
-thick
2 tb Butter

Mix the flour with the rosemary, sage, salt and pepper. Dredge the
pork chops lightly in the mixture. Heat the butter and olive oil in a
skillet over high heat until the butter melts and sizzles. Add the
garlic cloves and pork chops; cook, turning, until the chops are
browned on both sides. Discard the garlic when it is browned.

Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook the chops for another
10 minutes, turning them frequently until they are firm and no longer
pink inside.

Meanwhile, mix the mayonnaise with the lemon juice and minced garlic.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Serve the pork chops with dollops of the garlic mayonnaise.
