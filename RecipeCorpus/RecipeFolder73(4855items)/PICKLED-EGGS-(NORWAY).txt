Title: PICKLED EGGS (NORWAY)
Categories: Snacks, Norwegian
Yield: 12 Servings
12 md Eggs, hard-boiled (shelled)
20 oz White vinegar
1 ea Bay leaf
1 ts Mustard seeds
3 ea Cloves
1 ts Peppercorns, crushed
1/2 ea Cinnamon stick
1 ts Salt
Directions: þ Place everything, except the eggs, into a saucepan. þ
Bring gently to the boil, then remove to a basin. Cover and leave to
cool. þ Let the liquid stand for 4 hours before using it, to allow
the
spices and  herbs to flavour the vinegar. þ Strain the vinegar. þ
If the spices and are left in, they discolour the eggs. þ Put the
eggs into dry, sterelised, widw-necked jars-don't pack them
too firmly. þ Pour the liquid over the eggs to cover them, then
seal the jars. þ Don't use for a couple of days after they are
prepared. I find they
keep perfectly for at least 6 weeks but they must be kept
refrigerated. Cut the eggs into quarters or halves to serve or use
slices as a garnish on biscuits or cold meat.
