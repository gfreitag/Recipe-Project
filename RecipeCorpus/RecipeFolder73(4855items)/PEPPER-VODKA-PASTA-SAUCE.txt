Title: PEPPER VODKA PASTA SAUCE
Categories: Beverages, Alcohol, Pasta, Sauces, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings  Ingredients: 1 tablespoon dry hot chiles, crushed 1 fifth Vodka
Directions: Put the chiles in the vodka. Let it set for at least a
week, then strain off.  Put the bottle in the freezer. Because of the
alchohol, it won't freeze, but it will get almost syrup-like. It is
great in bloody marys,and in the folllowing pasta recipe, too.

Pasta and Vodka 1 1/2 lbs your choice of pasta 7 tbs butter 1 tsp hot
red pepper flakes 1 cup pepper vodka 1 cup fresh peeled tomatoes (cut
up fine) 1 cup heavy cream 1 tsp salt 1 cup fresh grated parmesan
cheese.
Cook the pasta al dente.  While it's cooking, melt the butter, add
pepper and vodka, tomatoes and cream. Simmer five minutes or so. Add
salt. Drain pasta, put it in the pan with the sauce, stir the
parmesian in, mix thoroughly (over low heat) and serve.
