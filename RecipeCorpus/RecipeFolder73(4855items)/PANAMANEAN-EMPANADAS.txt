Dough: Sift flour into a mixing bowl. Cut in the chilled Crisco and
butter until it resembles a coarse cornmeal. Add a little of the
water until the pastry sticks together into a ball. Put dough in
refrigerator for an hour. Roll out on a lightly floured board-- 1/8th
inch thick. Cut with cookie cutter or glass for appetizer sized
empanadas. Use a plate for luncheon size empanadas. On each round,
put about 1/2 teaspoon filling (appetizer size). Fold over and flute
edges with fork. Brush tops with beaten egg. Bake at 400 degrees
until golden brown.

Filling:

Place oil in frypan and fry pork a little. Add rest of ingredients and
simmer for 1/2 hour. Add salt and pepper to taste.
