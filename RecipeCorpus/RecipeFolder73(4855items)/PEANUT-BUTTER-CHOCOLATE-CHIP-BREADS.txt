Title: PEANUT BUTTER CHOCOLATE CHIP BREADS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 25 Servings
3 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/2 ts Double-acting baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
6 tb Unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 c  Chunk-style peanut butter
1 c  Firmly packed light brown su
2 ea Large eggs
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
1 1/2 c  Miniature chocolate chips
This recipe can be used to make mini-muffins or mini-loaves. Into a
bowl sift together the flour, the baking powder, the baking soda, and
the salt. In a large bowl with an electric mixer cream together the
butter, the peanut butter, and the brown sugar and beat in the eggs,
1 at a time. Beat in the buttermilk and beat the mixture until it is
combined well. Add the flour mixture, beat the batter until it is
just combined, and stir in the chocolate chips. Divide the batter
among 5 buttered and floured loaf pans, each 5 3/4 by 3 1/4 by 2
inches, and bake the breads in the middle of a preheated 350 oven for
40 to 45 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Remove the
breads from the pans and let them cool, right sides up, on a rack.
The breads keep, wrapped well in plastic wrap and foil, chilled for 1
week or frozen for 1 month. Makes 5 small loaves.
