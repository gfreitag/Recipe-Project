thin slices. Set aside. Heat some oil. Saute the onion and garlic.
Add chicken, pork, shrimp, soy sauce and patis. Cook until shrimp
turns pink. Put mixture on plate. To the wok or saucepan now add the
green beans, cabbage, carrots, and celery. Add one cup broth, and
season with salt and pepper. Stir fry 2 minutes.  Take out 1 cup of
veggies and set aside (this is for garnish). To the remaining
veggies, add the noodles and stir over low heat. If the noodles are
too dry, add some more broth. Mix in most of the meat/shrimp mixture.
Season to taste. When mixture has warmed through, put it on a
platter.  Garnish with remaining meat and veggies. Garnish further
with sliced hard boiled eggs and sliced scallion. Serve with lemon,
patis and soy sauce. Pancit Guisado (for 8-10)
