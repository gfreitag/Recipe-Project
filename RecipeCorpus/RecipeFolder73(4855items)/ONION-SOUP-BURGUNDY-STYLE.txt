there should be about 12 cups.  In a large, heavy, ovenproof
casserole or deep skillet, heat the butter and add the onions and
garlic. Cook, stirring, until the onions are wilted and start to
brown, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put the
casserole in the oven and bake for 15 minutes.

3.  Remove the casserole from the oven and sprinkle the onion mixture
with flour,  stirring to coat the onion pieces evenly. Add the water
and wine and cook over high heat, scraping around the bottom and
sides to dissolve the browned particles.  Add the bay leaf and thyme
and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring frequently.

4.  Meanwhile, put the bread slices on a baking sheet and bake until
brown and crisp.

5.  Increase the oven temperature to 450F degrees

with the soup.  If individual tureens are used, place 2 slices of
toast atop the soup.  if a large tureen is used, cover with the
toast, overlapping. Sprinkle the toast with the Gruyere, then the
Parmesan. place the Tureens on a baking dish to catch any drippings.
Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the soup is piping hot, bubbling
and brown on top.
