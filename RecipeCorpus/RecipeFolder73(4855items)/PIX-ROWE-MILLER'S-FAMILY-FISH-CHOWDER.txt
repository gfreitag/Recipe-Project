Title: PIX ROWE MILLER'S FAMILY FISH CHOWDER
Categories: Fish, Soup
Yield: 6 Servings
6 sl Bacon -- 1/4" thick
3 c  Diced yellow onions
6 md Potatoes -- peeled
1 lb Haddock
1 lb Cod
2 cn Evaporated milk -- (3 cups)
1 c  Whole milk
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
Fry the bacon, remove from the pan, and place on a paper towel. Saute
the onions in the bacon fat and set the pan aside. Cut the potatoes
in half the long way, then into 1/4" slices. Put them in a
nonreactive pot large enough for the chowder. Cover the potatoes with
water and boil until tender. Becareful not to put in too much water
or the chowder will be soupy. While the potatoes are cooking, cut the
fish into generous bite-sized pieces. When the potatoes are ready,
add the fish to the pot, cover and simmer until the fish flakes. When
the fish is done, crumble the bacon and add it to the pot along with
the onions and any grease in the pan, the evaporated and whole milks.
Bring the mixture to boil, cover, and turn the heat down. Simmer for
five minutes and add salt and pper to taste. Chowder invariably
tastes better when made a day ahead.

According to Katherine Hall Page.... The Rowe recipe may be happily
modified in all sorts of ways. The chowder is still quite delectable
with olive oil instead of bacon fat. You may also use salt pork. Two
kinds of fish make for a more interesting chowder, but these can be
any combination of the following: haddock, cod, pollack, monkfish and
hake. Finally there is the question of garnishes: dill chopped
parsley, oyster crackers, butter are all good. And Faith and Pix's
friend on Sanpere, Jane Weiss, swears by her chowder to which she
adds curry spices!
