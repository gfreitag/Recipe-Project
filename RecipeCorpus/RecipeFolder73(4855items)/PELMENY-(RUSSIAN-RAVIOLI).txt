:    For the dough, mix flour, eggs, salt and water into a firm paste
and let stand 1 hour.  Roll dough out very thin and cut into 2 1/2"
circles.

:    For the filling, mix meat, onion, salt and pepper together and
add enough water to make the filling juicy.

:    Smooth a little cold water half way around the edge of each
circle, and put a small mound of filling in the middle. Fold over and
seal the edges firmly together. Traditionalists then bring the
corners together and crimp them together to form a ball.
:    Carefully lower the pelmeny into boiling water, optionally
flavored with a couple of chicken bouillon cubes, and cook for 15
minutes. :    Serve with soy sauce, sour cream and/or vinegar.
