The original recipe calls for hibiscus flowers and suggested
strawberries as a substitute. I have reversed the order. As well, I
don't think it is necessary to use distilled water in most locations.
In medium saucepan, combine 2 1/2 cups water, sugar and hibiscus
flowers (or hulled strawberries). Bring to a boil, stirring to
dissolve sugar. Reduce heat. Simmer 5 minutes to extract pink to
extract pink from flowers. Remove from heat. Stir in lavender leaves.
Cover and cool. Strain cooled herb liquid into large pitcher or jar
(if using strawberries, gently press juice from berries.) Add
remaining 2 1/2 cups water and lemon juice. Stir well. Add 1/2 cup
more sugar, if desired. Just before serving, add ice cubes. Pour into
chilled glasses.Garnish with lavender flowers. YIELD: 6-8 Servings
