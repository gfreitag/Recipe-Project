Title: PIZZA DOUGH (PENNY)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/2 c  All purpose flour
1 pk Rapid rising yeast
1/2 ts Salt
2/3 c  Very warm water
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Honey
In lg bowl combine 2 cups of flour, yeast and salt. In measuring cup
mix water , olive oil and honey. Stir into flour mix forming soft
dough. Turn out onto floured surface and knead with remaining 1/2 c
flour until dough is very elastic- 10 min- dough should be soft so
add flour gradually and only what you need. (The amount will vary
depending on the moisture content in the flour, humidity, etc --just
go by the feel of the dough)

Wash, dry and lightly oil the mixing bowl, place dough in bowl,
turning to oil all the sides of the dough. Cover w/ plastic and towel
and let rise in warm place until double 30-45 min.(you can let it
rise at room temp for a longer period - up to 2 hrs - if that is more
convenient, if it goes longer, punch it down and let it rise
again,longer rise times make the dough more flavorfull).

Shape dough, top it as you wish and bake in 400 oven for about 12-15
min. I personally recommend baking it on a baking stone if you have
one.

As for the sauce- I get the Contadina in a squeeze bottle, then
spinkle extra oregano, basil and thyme on top before adding other
toppings.

I've also had success substituting 1/2 cup of flour with white whole
wheat flour- more than that makes the dough really stiff - I also add
an extra tsp of honey when I sub in the wheat flour.

Enjoy, Penny
