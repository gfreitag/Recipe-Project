Title: PAN HAGGIS
Categories: Pork, Lamb, Ethnic
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Pig's or lamb's liver
3    Onions
5 oz Minced suet
1/2    Pt. water
3 oz Pinhead oatmeal
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
Simmer liver and onions in stock for 30-40 minutes. Put oatmeal in a
heavy pan over heat or under the grill, and toast until nicely
browned. When the meat is cooked, remove from pan, keeping liquid.
Mince liver and onions, add oatmeal, suet, salt and pepper. Moisten
with sufficient liquid to give a softish consistency, put in a
greased pudding basin and cover with a double lid of foil, and steam
for 3 hours.

Now, you probably don't have a pudding basin (I'm not sure what one
is).

From "The Highlander's Cookbook," by Sheila MacNiven Cameron, here is
an alternate method:

Turn into a greased Pyrex bowl. Cover with two or three layers of
foil. Steam on a rack in a pan of boiling water for two hours, adding
more boiling water as it boils away.
