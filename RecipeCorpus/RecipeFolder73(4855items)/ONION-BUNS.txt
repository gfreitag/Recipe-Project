Title: ONION BUNS
Categories: Vegetarian, Breads
Yield: 16 Servings
2 1/2 c  Soy milk
3 tb Dairy free margarine
1 tb Prepared yellow mustard
2 tb Dried minced onion
2 1/4 oz Active dry yeast
2 tb Sugar
6 c  Unbleached white flour
1/2 c  Wheatgerm
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
1/4 ts Turmeric
Heat soymilk with margarine, mustard, and dry onion until warm to
touch (not scalding). Let cool to 120-130 degrees F.
Mix undissolved yeast with sugar, 2 cups flour, salt, pepper and
turmeric in a large bowl. Beat in seasoned soymilk; mix well. Stir in
wheat germ, then add remaining flour one cup at a time, mixing each
cup in until well-mixed. When you have a soft ball, turn out onto a
floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes until dough is smooth
and elastic.
Place in a greased bowl, turning to coat dough. Cover and let rise
in a warm place until doubled, about 1
1/2    hours.
Punch dough down and divide into 16 equal pieces.
Shape into burger buns or hot dog buns, placing on cookie sheets
that have been sprayed with non-stick spray. Brush lightly with
vegetable oil. Cover with saran wrap. Allow to rise about 45 minutes.
Bake in a 350 degree oven about 20 minutes, until golden brown. Cool
on wire racks.
