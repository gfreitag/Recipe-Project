1 tb Olive oil
1 1/4 c  (1 medium) finely minced
Red onion
3 tb Finely minced garlic

Heat oil in a sauce pan and saute onions and garlic until just
beginning to color. Add remaining ingredients, bring to a boil then
reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 5 - 7 minutes. Marinade should
be lightly thickened.Remove from heat and cool before using. Yields
approximately 3 cups or enough to marinate two large chickens or a 5
pound boneless pork loin roast. Marinate refrigerated for at least 4
hours or overnight. Store any unused marinade in refrigerator. For a
flavorful sauce, reduce marinade to a light sauce consistency over
moderate heat. Strain, pushing on solids to extract all liquid.
