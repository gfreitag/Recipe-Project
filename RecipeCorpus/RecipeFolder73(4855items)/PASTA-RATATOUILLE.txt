Title: PASTA RATATOUILLE
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 6 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
3 T  Olive oil or vegetable oil
3    Cloves garlic; minced
1 c  Onion; chopped
1    Red bell pepper; chopped
1/2 c  Green pepper; chopped
2 md Zucchini; sliced thickly
1    Crookneck squash; sliced
-thickly
1 lg Eggplant; cut thickly
2 lg Cans tomatoes (28 oz each);
-drained well
1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Dried basil
1/4 ts Dried oregano
Freshly ground black pepper
1    Pkg. rigatoni or curly
Shaped pasta
Parmesan cheese; freshly
-grated
In a large sauce pot at least 6-quarts, heat the oil over medium
heat. Add garlic and stir for a few seconds and then add onion and
peppers. Cook for about 5 minutes stirring every so often to move the
mixture around in the pot.  When the vegetables are fairly soft, add
the eggplant and squashes. Stir fry and continue to cook stirring
quite often for at least another 5 minutes.  You may have to add a
little more oil to the pan if it looks dry. Add tomatoes which can be
crushed with a spoon if you wish and the sugar and spices. Bring it
to a boil and then reduce the heat. Cover the pan leaving it ajar
slightly to let the steam to escape and cook about 10-15 minutes more
making sure you stir it every so often. Remove the cover and simmer
another 5 minutes or so until vegetables appear soft and cooked
through.

While the vegetables are simmering, you can cook the pasta according
to the directions on the package.  Drain the pasta and toss the
vegetable mixture with it.  Serve with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

Note:  I sometimes add some sliced mushrooms and black olives which is
definitely not a traditional ratatouille, however, it makes it taste
wonderful.  I also sometimes add about 1/3 cup fume blanc or other dry
white wine when I add the tomatoes and spices.
