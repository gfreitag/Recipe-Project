Title: PFITZAUF
Categories: Muffins, German
Yield: 4 Servings
250 g  Flour (2 cups plus 3 1/2
-Tbsp)
1/2 l  Milk (2 cups plus 2 Tbsp)
4    Eggs
Salt
2 tb Melted butter
1 tb Sugar
Combine the flour, milk, eggs, salt, and - if desired ~ a little
sugar, and stir into a dough.  Then mix in the melted butter. Grease
a 'Pfitzauf' pan* and fill halfway up with the dough. Bake in a hot
oven for 25 minutes until light brown, WITHOUT ever opening the oven
door to check! The 'Pfitzauf' gets dusted with sugar and is served
with stewed fruit.

((*Note:  I have another recipe for 'Pfitzauf' which suggests one may
substitute a muffin pan lined with paper cupcake holders. The same
recipe specifies 400 degrees F. K.B.))

Serves 4.
