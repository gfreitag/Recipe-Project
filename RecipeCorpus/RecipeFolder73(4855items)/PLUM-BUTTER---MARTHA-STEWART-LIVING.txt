Categories: Sauces, Break/brnch, Preserves, Soup/stews
Yield: 3 1/2 cups
3 1/2 lb Plums
1 1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Ground cardamom
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1. Split plums in half, remove pits, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Do
not peel. Place in a 6-quart nonreactive saucepan and add 1 C water
and the sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook until fruit is
very soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat; puree fruit and liquid
in a food mill or food processor.

2. Rinse saucepan and return puree to pan along with cardamom and
cinnamon. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently to prevent
scorching, until thick enough to spread, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove
from heat and let cool. Store in an airtight container. The butter
will keep for up to 1 month in the refrigerator, 6 months in the
freezer.
