This is a rich , lovely cream bisque that is delicately flavored with
sauteed vegetables and the oyster's own liquor. Not that the bisque is
Briefly cooked at the end to preserve the integrity of the oysters.
Whipped cream and Cayenne pepper for garnish * my sister uses the new
White Worchestershire sauce instead of the tabasco and a shake of New
Orleans seasoning from Paul Pruhomme.( variation) In a cast iron
skillet melt the butter and saute the onion, celery and carrot 5 to
ten minutes. Drain oysters, reserving the liquor, chop 3 or 4 oysters

of the oysters begin to curl. Serve bisque in bowls. Garnish each
