1/2 c  Grand Marnier
4 oz Sponge cake; diced
1/3 c  Water
3    Oranges; zested & sectioned

1/2 c  Sugar

In a small saucepan place the water and bring it to a boil. Add the
orange zest and blanch it for 3 minutes. Drain off the water and add
the orange zest to the soaked cake. Mix it together well and set it
aside.

In a medium bowl place the first 1/2 cup of sugar, egg yolks, and the
1 cup Grand Marnier.  Whip the ingredients together for 4 to 6
minutes, or until the mixture becomes light and creamy.

In another medium bowl, place the egg whites and the second 1/2 cup of
sugar.  Whip the ingredients together for 4 to 6 minutes, or until
stiff peaks are formed. Gently fold the egg white mixture into the
egg yolk mixuture.  Gently fold in the soaked cake with the orange
zest, then the whipped cream.  Pour the mixture into a large serving
bowl and freeze it for 1 hour.

Garnish the parfait with the orange sections.
