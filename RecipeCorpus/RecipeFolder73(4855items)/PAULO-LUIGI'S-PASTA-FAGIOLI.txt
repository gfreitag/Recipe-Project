This recipe was handed down to me from my mother. It can be made with
canned beans to save time.  Use 4 cans to 1 pound dried. Soak beans
overnight in a 5 quart pot (kettle), in twice as much water as beans.
The next day drain the beans, add fresh water just covering the beans
and boil until beans are cook (1 1/2 hours). Water level must remain
above the beans. Stir occasionally, for best results use a wooden
spoon. Keep beans warm. Generously coat a frying pan with olive oil.
Add onion and saute until translucent. Add garlic and basil leaves.
Saute 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add 1 tablespoon flour and
cook for one minute. Add 1/2 cup water, stir until thickened (1-2
minutes). Add tomato paste, stir until dissolved.  Remove from heat
and add to still warm beans. For desired thickness add water.  Stir
until mixed, adding peppers and salt to taste. Simmer over low heat
for 15 minutes stirring occasionally. Cook pasta al dente (4-5
minutes). Drain and cool. Set aside. Before serving, place pasta in
the bottom of a soup bowl. Add hot bean mixture. Mix and garnish with
parsley. Serves 6-8.
