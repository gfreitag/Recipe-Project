"This is a good way to use up leftover pineapple skins and cores.
Keep the squash refrigerated."

Put the pineapple peel and core in a nonreactive saucepan and add
enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 30
minutes. Strain the liquid through a cloth and press the juice out of
the peel and core. Measure the mixture, and for each cup (1/4 litre)
use 1 cup of sugar. Heat the juice with the sugar over low heat until
the sugar is dissolved. Cool the mixture. Add the lemon juice. Pour
into clean bottles, cork and store.
