Combine the dried fruits and peels in a large bowl and sprinkle with
cognac.  Cover and place in the refrigerator overnight (or longer - in
which case you may want to add more cognac).

To the fruits in the large bowl, add nuts and suet. Resift flour with
the baking soda, salt and spices; then sift over the fruit mixture
while tossing and mixing with a wooden spoon to evenly distribute the
dry ingredients.  Stir in jam and brown sugar.

Prepare the bread crumbs (use the food processor, removing crusts
first if they are crusty and hard). Sprinkle bread crumbs into the
sherry, mixing with a fork. Add to the fruit mixture.

Add the beaten egg yolks; mix thoroughly.  Last, fold in beaten egg
whites.

Prepare two pudding molds.  This recipe makes enough for one 2-quart
mold, and the remainder can be steamed in a coffee can - a 26-ounce
can makes a round pudding about 3" tall. (You could make one huge
pudding if you have a container.)

Grease molds with butter and then sprinkle them with sugar or dust
with flour.  Arrange candied cherries in molds, if desired (cherries
should be dusted with flour). Fill 2-quart mold no more than 2/3 full
with batter. Cover pudding mold with its lid, fasten with clamps or
tie on securely.

For the coffee can, cover with its plastic lid, tie it on and wrap
all with aluminum foil.  (The plastic will split.) For a bowl without
a lid, cover the top with layered waxed paper tied down securely,
then do the same with aluminum foil.
