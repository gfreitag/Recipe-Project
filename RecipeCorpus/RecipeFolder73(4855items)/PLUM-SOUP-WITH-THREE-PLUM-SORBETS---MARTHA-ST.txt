occasionally, until the plums are very soft, about 35 minutes. Crush
larger pieces of plums with the back of a wooden spoon. Remove from
heat, remove the cinnamon stick, and stir in the lemon juice.

3. Chill thoroughly. Cut remaining plum into slices. Serve soup with
scoops of sorbet and garnish with plum slices.
