Prick the eggplant in a few places with a knife. Place on a baking

cooking, until the eggplant is tender but not falling apart. When the
eggplant is cool enough to handle, peel it and dice the pulp. Place
the pulp in a colander to drain away any bitter juices. Discard the
skin.

tomatoes are tart, add a pinch of sugar to compensate.  When the
