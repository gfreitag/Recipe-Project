Title: PATE BRISEE MARTHA STEWART
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1 c  Cold unsalted butter, cut
Into small
Pieces
1/2 c  Ice water
Place flour, salt and sugar in the work bowl of a food processor. Add
butter pieces and process for about 10 seconds, or just until mixture
resembles a coarse meal.

With machine running, add ice water, drop by drop, through
food-processor feed tube. When dough holds together but is not wet or
sticky, stop adding; do not process for longer than 30 seconds. Test
dough by squeezing a small amount together. If it is still crumbly,
add more water.

Divide dough in half and turn out onto two large pieces of plastic
wrap. Press dough into flat circles (this makes rolling easier than
if the pastry is chilled as a ball). Wrap in plastic and chill for at
least an hour.
