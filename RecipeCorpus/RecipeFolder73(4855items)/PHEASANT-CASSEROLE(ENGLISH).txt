Title: PHEASANT CASSEROLE(ENGLISH)
Categories: Soup/stews, English
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Pheasants
2 tb Beef dripping
1    Onion
1    Carrot
1    Stick of celery
Salt and pepper
2    Glasses red wine
Set oven to 350/F or Mark 4. Prepare the vegetables and chop them
roughly. Joint the pheasants, using the breasts and legs only (this
saves having too many bones to cope with). Heat the beef dripping in
a thick frying pan and brown the pheasant joints. Remove from the pan
and place in a casserole dish. Place the vegetables in the frying pan
and cook for 2 minutes, add the red wine and bring to the boil. Pour
the mixture over the pheasant joints, season and cover the casserole.
Cook in the oven for 1-1 1/2 hours until tender.
