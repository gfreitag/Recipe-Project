1    Recipe BASIC TOMATO SAUCE
-(See separate recipe)
1 ts Vegetable oil; divided
Place all meatball ingredients in a medium bowl. Knead the mixture
with your hands until it is smooth. To prevent sticking, dip your
hands into cool water before forming each meatball. Form mixture into
30 1 1/2-inch balls.

Pour the tomato sauce into a large, heavy-bottom saucepan and bring
it to a simmer over low heat. Warm 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil in a
large non-stick skillet. Add half the meatballs to the skillet and
brown them on all sides. Spoon the meatballs into the tomato sauce.
Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil to the skillet and brown
the rest of the meatballs, then add them to the sauce. Simmer,
stirring, for 20 minutes.

While sauce is simmering, prepare pasta according to package
directions; drain. Transfer to a large serving bowl. Remove bay
leaves from sauce; pour sauce over pasta and serve.
