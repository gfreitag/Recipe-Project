Title: PATTY ANN'S STRAWBERRY TARTS
Categories: Christmas, Bar cookies
1/2 c  Butter
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Sugar
3 c  Flour
2    Eggs
1/2 ts Baking Powder
1 c  Pecans -- finely chopped
1/2 ts Salt
1 TB Brandy Or Rum Flavoring
1    jar Smucker's=AE Strawberry
Preserves -- (18 0z. jar)
:

Oven 350=B0 F.

In large bowl of mixmaster put sugar, butter, eggs and flavoring. Beat
until light and fluffy.  Remove from mixer and by hand, work in dry
ingredients and nuts.

Grease a 9 x 13-inch pan and dust with flour.  Press 2/3 of dough
into pan. Spread the jar of preserves over this. Lattice remaining
dough in strips over preserves. Bake at 350=B0 for 25-30 minutes. Let
cool in pan until lukewarm, so that hot preserves won't burn you when
you cut cookies into squares.

Store in tin box between layers of wax paper.  Can be frozen.

TO LATTICE DOUGH:

Roll small pieces between palms or on lightly floured surface. You
will have to piece strips.  You can't roll them all in one piece.
Keep hands or fingertips floured to make strips.

NOTE:

You may substitute Smucker's=AE Raspberry Preserves. I could never
find raspberry preserves around Christmas.
