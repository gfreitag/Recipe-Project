Title: PESTO STUFFED MUSHROOMS
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Recipe
1 c  Italian bread crumbs
1/2 c  Pesto
2 tb Prepared horseradish
1 lb Fresh mushrooms
Pimentos
Wash and stem the mushrooms and allow to dry.  Combine bread crumbs
and pesto; mix well.  Add horseradish and blend thoroughly. Pack each
mushroom cap, mounding with the pesto mixture.

If serving cold, lay a small piece of pimento across top for color,
and serve.  If you'd like to serve them hot, omit the pimento; place
in a 350F oven and bake for 15 minutes. Serve immediately.
