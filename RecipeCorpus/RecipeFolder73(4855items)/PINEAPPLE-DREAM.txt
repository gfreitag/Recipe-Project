1 c  2% cottage cheese
1 ts Powdered sugartwin sweetener

To colour coconut, put a small drop of food colouring in a saucer and
stir the coconut around in it or brown slightly in a non-stick pan.

Sprinkle gelatin over pineapple juice in a small saucepan, let stand
5 min to soften.  Add coconut extract. Heat just until gelatin melts.
Cool to room temperature. Pour into large mixing bowl.

processor. Puree.  Mix into gelatin mixture.

Combine whipped topping mix and milk.  Beat until stiff peaks form.
Fold into gelatin mixture.  Pour into 4 cup bowl or individual

stem glasses or fancy little dessert dishes and top each with a piece
of cherry. Chill at least 2 hours before serving.
