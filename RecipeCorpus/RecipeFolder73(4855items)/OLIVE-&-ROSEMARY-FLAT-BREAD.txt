Stephen Ceideburg
1/2 c  Brown rice flour (see note)
1 1/2 ts Granular yeast
2 ts Sugar
1 1/4 c  Warm water (110 degrees F.)
4 lg Egg whites, at room
-temperature
1 tb Olive oil
12    Oil-cured black olives,
-pitted and roughly chopped
4 ts Dried rosemary, or to taste
1    Egg yolk mixed with 1/2
-teaspoon water
1 lg Garlic clove, peeled, cut in
-3 pieces
1/2 c  Corn flour (see note)
1/2 c  Cornstarch
2 ts Xanthan gum powder
1    To 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
Stir together 1/2 cup of the rice flour, the yeast, sugar and 1/2 cup
of the warm water in a 2-cup glass measure. Let rest in a warm place
until doubled in volume, about 10 minutes.

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and draw two 8 inch
circles on it (use a cake pan as a guide).

Beat egg whites lightly, add olive oil, chopped olives and 2
teaspoons of the rosemary; set aside.

Combine garlic and egg yolk; set aside. (Garlic will perfume the
glaze but won't burn in the oven, as chopped garlic would.)

Combine remaining 1 cup rice flour, the corn flour, corn- starch,
xanthan gum powder and salt in bowl.

Add remaining 3/4 cup warm water to egg white-olive mixture a stir
into flour. Stir in yeast mixture and beat until smooth.

Using a rubber spatula, spread soft dough into 8-inch circles marked
on the parchment paper heaping it up slightly in the middle. Cover
loaves with lightly greased plastic wrap and let rise until doubled
in bulk, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Discard garlic and brush egg glaze over loaves. Sprinkle tops with
remaining 2 teaspoons rosemary. Using a razor blade, slash tops of
loaves into a large diamond grid pattern. (Use an up-and-down cutting
motion rather than dragging the blade through the soft dough.)

Bake for 20 minutes, until well browned.

Makes two 8-inch diameter, 11-ounce loaves.

Note: Brown rice flour and corn flour may be found in some health food
stores and Rainbow Groceries.
