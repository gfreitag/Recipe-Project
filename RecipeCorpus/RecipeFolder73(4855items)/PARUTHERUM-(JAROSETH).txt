Title: PARUTHERUM (JAROSETH)
Categories: Pileggi, Not exp, Try it
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM------------------SEPHARDIC COOKING; MARK-----------------------
~-Jewish, Cochin
1/2 lb Dark raisins
1/2 lb Date paste
1/4 c  Almonds, blanched
2 tb Sesame seeds
1 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Wine vinegar
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Water

1.  Into a processor, put all of the ingredients and process together
into a smooth paste.  Put the paste in a pan and simmer over very low
heat for 1/2 hour. Cool.

Serve at room temperature with matzoh at the Passover Seders.

NOTE:  The date paste, for those who cannot find it already prepared,
is nothing more than seedless dates ground to a paste with the
smallest amount of water. I suggest 1/2 pound of dates and 3
tablespoons of water, processed together to smoothness.

A sweet and pungent jaroseth is unusual since other cultures do not
use vinegar and therefore lacks pungency.
