Title: PEANUT FLUFF FUDGE
Categories: Candies
Yield: 2 Pounds
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Milk
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Marshmallow creme
1/2 c  Peanut butter
Peanut Butter Fudge:  Grease 8 by 8 inch baking pan; set aside. Into
a 6 quart heavy saucepan, measure sugar, milk and salt. Over medium
heat heat to boiling, stirring constantly.

With candy thermometer in place, cook, without stirring, until
temperature reaches 235 F or soft ball stage (when a small amount of
mixture dropped into very cold water forms a ball which flattens on
removal from water). Remove saucepan from heat.

Without stirring, allow mixture to cool to 110 F or lukewarm, about 45
minutes (bottom of pan will feel comfortably warm).

Stir in marshmallow creme and peanut butter. With a wooden spoon, beat
mixture until it holds its shape and loses some of its gloss, about 5
to 7 minutes. Turn fudge into prepared pan. Allow fudge to set, about
30 minutes.
