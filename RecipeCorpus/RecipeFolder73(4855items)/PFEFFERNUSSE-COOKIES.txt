Title: PFEFFERNUSSE COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 180 Servings
3 tb Lemon juice
1/2 c  Citron or other candied
-fruit or fruit peel,
-chopped
6 c  Cake flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cloves
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Mace
1 tb Cinnamon
1/2 c  Chopped nuts
Grated rind of 1 lemon

Beat the eggs well.  Add sugar about two tablespoons at a time and
beat thoroughly with each addition.

Add lemon rind and juice, finely chopped citron, the dry ingredients
which have been mixed and sifted together, and the finely chopped
nuts.

Chill at least one hour, roll out 1/2 inch thick and cut out with a
Pfeffernusse cutter, a round cutter about 7/8 of an inch in diameter.
( If a Pfeffernusse cutter is not available, a narrow bottle top or
round tin bouillon cube box will do very nicely. )

Place Pfeffernusse on a cookie sheet and let stand overnight in a cool
place to dry.  The next morning before baking invert each cookie and
put a drop of fruit juice or brandy on the moist spot on the bottom
of the cookie and bake upside down.  This tends to make the
Pfeffernusse "pop."

Bake in a slow oven (300 degrees F.) for 8 minutes. Makes 180-200
cookies. Let ripen and soften before using.
