Categories: Cookies, Snacks
Yield: 4 Servings
3 c  Old-fashioned rolled oats
-(not quick-cooking)
1 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt (if peanut butter is
-unsalted)
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
1 ts Baking soda
1 c  Unsalted butter, at room
-temperature (2 sticks)
1 c  Peanut butter, chunky or
-smooth
1 c  Firmly packed light-brown
-sugar
1 c  Granulated sugar
2    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips OR
-raisins
Preheat the oven to moderate (350F)

Stir together the oats, flour, cinnamon, salt (if using), nutmeg, and
baking soda in a large bowl.  Beat together the butter,peanut butter,
and the brown and white sugars in a large bowl at medium speed until
light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.  Add the eggs, one at a time,
beating for 1 minute after each addition. Beat in the vanilla.

Beat in the oat mixture on the lowest mixer speed just until blended.
Stir in the chips or raisins by hand. The dough can be refrigerated,
covered, for up to 24 hours, or used immediately.

If using unchilled dough, drop onto ungreased baking sheets without
rolling and do not flatten.  Scoop chilled dough by rounded
tablespoons, roll into balls between palms, and place on greased
baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.  Flatten to 1/2-inch thickness
with palm of hand.

Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until golden and just firm around the
edges. Cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes. Drizzle with melted
dark and white chocolate, if you wish.  Transfer to racks to cool
completely. Store airtight for up to 3 days.

Makes about 4 dozen cookies.
