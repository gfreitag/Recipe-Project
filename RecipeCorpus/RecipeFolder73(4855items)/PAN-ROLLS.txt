Pan Rolls (this recipe is great for the BM using the dough setting)

In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in lukewarm water. Blend in eggs and
oil or margarine.  Add 5 cups bread mix. Blend well. Add additional
bread mix to make a soft, but not too sticky dough. Knead about 5
minutes until dough is smooth.
Lightly butter bowl.  Put dough in bowl and turn to butter top. Cover
dough with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in
bulk, about 1 hour. Grease a 13" x 9" baking pan or two 9" round
pans. Punch down dough again until doubled in bulk, about 30 to 40
minutes. Preheat oven to 375. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, until golden
brown. Makes about 24 rolls. Formatted by Elaine Radis BGMB90B; JUNE,
