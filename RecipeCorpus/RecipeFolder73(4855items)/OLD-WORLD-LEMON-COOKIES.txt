Flatten ball of dough, sprinkle grated rind and lemon extract over it
and knead it until well distributed. Roll dough out very thin (about
1/8 inch) and cut into 3- inch, or larger, rounds. Place on lightly
greased flat pans so that they will not touch. Let stand about 10
minutes. Press centers to make slight depression to hold 1/2 tsp.
Lemon Cheese (more for larger rounds). Spread beaten egg white around
rim and sprinkle lightly with sugar. Bake in oven preheated to 350
for at least 30 minutes until delicately tinted and the glaze has
crystallized.  The longer they are left in the oven to become drier
and crispier the more delicious they are.

Lemon Cheese:  Mix together in saucepan 2 cups white sugar, grated
rind and juice of 3 large lemons, 3 large whole eggs (beaten), 1/4
tsp salt and 1/4 cup butter. Cook over slow heat, stirring constantly
until thick. Yield: about 2-1/2 to 3 cups.  This can be sealed in
jars to keep like jelly or will keep indefinitely in covered
container in refrigerator. It can be used as topping for baked
puddings, fillings for tarts and jelly rolls.
