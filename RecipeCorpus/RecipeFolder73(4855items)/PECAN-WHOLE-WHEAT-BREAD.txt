Title: PECAN WHOLE WHEAT BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Loaves
2 tb Yeast
2 1/2 c  Warm milk (105-115 deg F)
1/3 c  Molasses
3 tb Walnut or vegetable oil
2 ts Salt
2 c  Toasted pecans, broken into
-large pieces
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  Rye flour (or an additional
-1 cup whole wheat)
3 c  To 4 cups bread or all-
-purpose flour
Proof yeast in warm milk in large bowl. Add molasses, oil, salt, and
pecan pieces, whole wheat and rye flour. Mix together. Add bread
flour, 1/2 cup at a time and mix until dough is stiff. Remove dough
from bowl onto well-floured surface and gradually knead in enough
remaining flour to make a soft dough. Place dough in lightly oiled
bowl, flour and let rise until double. Punch down and divide in half.
Form each half into a loaf and place in bread pans (9x5inch or 8x4
inch) Let rise until doubled. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for
35 minutes. Remove from pans. Continue to bake until loaf sounds
hollow when tapped on bottom. Let cool on rack before cutting. May
need to cover tops with aluminum foil in final 10-15minutes of baking
if getting too brown on top.
