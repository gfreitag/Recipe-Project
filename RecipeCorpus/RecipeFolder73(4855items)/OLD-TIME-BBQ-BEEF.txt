Title: OLD-TIME BBQ BEEF
Categories: Crockpot, Barbeque, Sandwiches
Yield: 4 Servings
-Cindy Kurschner (JGGB54B
3 lb Fresh Beef Brisket;
-(I use English Cut Roast)
1/2 ts Garlic Salt
1/2 ts Celery Salt
1/2 ts Onion Powder
1/4 c  Liquid Smoke
1 cn Tomato Paste (6 oz.)
1 c  -Water
1 c  Barbecue Sauce
1/4 c  Brown Sugar (packed)
1/2 ts Salt
Rub both sides of beef with garlic salt, celery salt and onion
powder. Put in baking dish and pour liquid smoke on both sides. Cover
tightly; refrigerate overnight, In the morning, combine the remaining
ingredients in crockpot.  Add beef; cover.  Cook 8-10 hours on LOW.
NOTE: I have found the cook time is not accurate to go by. It takes
me longer to get it done. I usually put it on to cook overnight on
LOW and continue cook on LOW through the day until done. You might
want to experiment. When done, the roast literally falls apart. Serve
it on buns. Add chips and a fresh fruit salad and you're all set.
