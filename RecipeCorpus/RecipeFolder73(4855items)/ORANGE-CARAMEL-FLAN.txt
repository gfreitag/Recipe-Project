Title: ORANGE CARAMEL FLAN
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb Water
3    Eggs
1/4 c  Frozen orange juice concentr
12 oz Evaporated milk
1/2 c  Milk
2 ts Vanilla
1/8 ts Almond extract
Preheat oven to 300.

Mix 1/4 cup sugar with water in heavy small saucepan. Cook over
medium-low heat until sugar dissolves, stirring frequently. Increase
heat and cover and boil without stirring until sugar turns deep
golden brown. Immediately pour caramel into six 6-ounce custard cups.

Whisk eggs, orange juice concentrate and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in
large bowl.  Gradually whisk in both milks and extracts. Divide
custard among prepared cups. Place cups in large baking pan and add
enough hot water to pan to come halfway up sides of cups. Bake until
custards are set, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Remove cups from water and
refrigerate. Invert cups when ready to serve.
