Title: OLD-TIME LADIES AUXILIARY COFFEE
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 12 Servings
1 c  Regular grind coffee
1    Egg, lightly beaten
1    Egg shell, crushed
Few grains of salt
8 c  Cold water
Mix the coffee, beaten egg, crushed egg shell and salt. Wet with cold
water and wring out a cloth bag large enough to permit the coffee to
swell until double in bulk.  Place the coffee inside the bag and tie
shut. Bring the 8 cups of water to a full boil and pop in the bag of
coffee. Let simmer 10 minutes, pushing the bag up and down several
times. Remove the bag and serve the coffee at once.  Makes 12
excellent cups. Source: The Canadian Heritage Cookbook ch.
