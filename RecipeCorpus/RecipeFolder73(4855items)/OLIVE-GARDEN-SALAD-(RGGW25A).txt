NON FORMATED RECIPE
According to Gloria Pitzer, The Recipe Detective: Into blender put:
1- 1/2 cups bottle Italian dressing, 2 TB grated Parmesan, 2 TB
sugar, 1 lg. raw egg. Blend high speed 1/2 minute or till smooth.
Lightly moisten mixed greens of fresh spinach leaves, iceberg lettuce
& romaine with dressing & let stand 5 mins be- fore adding other
salad ingredients. Serve with more dressing if desired. (The fresh
egg in the dressing is treated by the vinegar in Italian dressing so
that it has the same composition as when making mayonnaise with fresh
eggs.) Refrigerate tightly covered to use in 3 or 4 days. Do not
freeze.
