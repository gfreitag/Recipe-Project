Categories: Breads, Pastry, French
Yield: 1 Recipe
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
5 oz Plain flour
1 1/2 oz Butter
1 ea Egg
1/2 oz Salt
Water
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 1/4 lb Onions; thinly sliced
2 ea Tomatoes; skinned and
-chopped
12 ea Anchovy fillets
12 sm Black olives; pitted
Salt and pepper
Olive oil
CRUST: Cut butter into small pieces and rub it into flour. Add a good
pinch of salt. Make a well in the centre; put in the egg and the
yeast dissolved in about 2 tablespoons tepid water. Mix and knead
until the dough comes away clean from the sides of the bowl. Shape
into a ball, make a deep cross-cut on the top, put on a floured
plate, cover with a floured cloth, and leave in a warm place to rise
for 2 hours. FILLING: Heat 3 or 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy
fry-pan. Put in the onions and cook them very gently, with a cover on
the pan, until quite soft and a pale golden colour.  Add the tomatoes
and the seasonings (plus chopped garlic to taste, if desired) and
continue cooking until the onions and tomatoes have amalgamated, and
the moisture from the tomatoes has evaporated.

When the dough has risen; sprinkle it with flour and break it down
again. Knead once more into a ball and place in the centre of an
oiled 8-inch tart pan. Press the dough quickly but gently with your
knuckles outwards to the edge of the pan and up the rim.  Put in the
filling. Make a criss-cross lattice pattern with the anchovy fillets,
placing a halved olive in the centre of each opening in the lattice.
Leave it to rise for 15 minutes, then bake in the centre of an oven
preheated to 400 F for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 F and bake for
an additional 20 minutes.
