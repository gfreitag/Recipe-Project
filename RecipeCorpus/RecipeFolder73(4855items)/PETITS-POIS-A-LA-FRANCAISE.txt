Title: PETITS POIS A LA FRANCAISE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Frozen Peas
1/2    Lettuce Heart
6    Spring Onions
8 fl Double Cream
1 oz Butter
Salt and Pepper
1/2 c  Water
Shred the lettuce into little ribbons with a sharp knife. Clean and
shred the spring onions. Put the butter into a good solid pan with a
lid. Add the onions and lettuce. If using fresh peas, add them and
about half a cup of water and cook gently for about 10 minutes. If
using frozen, let the spring onions and lettuce cook on their own for
about 7 or 8 minutes, then add the peas and cook for a further 2 or 3
minutes. Don't add water there is enough in the frozen peas already.

Pour in the double cream, balance the seasoning and bring to the
boil, but don't let it cook for more than a minute more. The peas
will be green, firm and surrounded in the most delicious and wicked
sauce. Serve either with plain grilled meat or as a dish on its own
in little bowls with good bread.
