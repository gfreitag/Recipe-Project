Title: PASSOVER FARFEL MUFFINS
Categories: Passover, Brunch, Pesach brds
Yield: 8 Servings
-HENRY EDELBERG (HPCM50A)
1 1/2 c  Farfel
4    Eggs
-Salt & Pepper to taste
1 tb Schmaltz; more or less
Put farfel in colander with bowl underneath and pour boiling water
over - let stand till soggy about 5 minutes. Drain well and add eggs
and seasonings and schmaltz. Put dab of schmaltz in bottom of muffin
tin ~ heat pan in oven then take out and fill with mixture. Bake at
400 for 30 mins. I usually double recipe.

They come out all big and puffy and as they cool they flop. Also be
careful; the bottom of the oven gets covered with schmaltz. I usually
make these till the oven starts to smoke - but never have enough.
They're yummy.
