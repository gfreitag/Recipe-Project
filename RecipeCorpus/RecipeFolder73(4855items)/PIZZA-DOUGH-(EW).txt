Title: PIZZA DOUGH (EW)
Categories: Main dish, Breads
Yield: 2 Pizzas
1 ts Active dry yeast
1 2/3 c  (to 2 C) unbleached or all-
-purpose white flour
1 c  Cake flour
1 ts Salt
In a measuring cup or small bowl, sprinkle yeast ovr 1/4 cup warm
water; stir until dissolved.  In a mixing bowl, combine 1 2/3 cups of
the unbleached or all-purpose flour, cake flour and salt. Make a well
in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the yeast mixture.
With a wooden spoon, gradually stir in the flour, adding 3/4 cup warm
watr as you mix. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface
and knead until very smooth, soft and no longer sticky, about 10
minutes, adding additional flour as needed to keep the dough from
sticking. (The dough should still be quite wet, however.)

Set the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat lightly. Cover with
plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.

About 10 minutes before baking pizza, turn the dough onto the floured
board, punch it down and knead briefly. Use a pastry cutter or a thin,
sharp knife to divide the dough in half. (If you pull the dough
apart, you risk tearing the gluten strands.)  Pat each half into a
ball and flatten into a disk.  Proceed as directed in any of the
following pizza recipes. (The dough can be made ahead, enclosed in a
plastic bag and stored in the refrigrator for up to 2 days or in the
freezer for up to 2 months. Defrost for at least 8 hours in the
refrigerator and bring to room temp. before using.)

Makes about 1 1/2 lbs. of dough, enough for two 12-inch pizzas.
