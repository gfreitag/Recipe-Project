6. Combine the sherry, sesame oil, sugar, soy sauce, and Hoisin
Sauce.
7. To assemble, place duck slices on pancakes. Add scallions,
cucumbers, and Hoisin Sauce mixture to each. Serve. We insist on
using Long Island ducks for this, our specialty. When we carve
the duck in front of our guests, they may request skin only (the
traditional way of eating Peking Duck), skin with meat, or meat
from a certain part of the duck. The air separates the skin from
the meat; the marinade and the hanging help to a create a
deliciously rich, crisp skin.
