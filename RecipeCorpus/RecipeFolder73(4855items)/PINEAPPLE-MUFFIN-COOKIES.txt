Categories: Cookies, Muffins
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Shortening
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1    Egg

1 ts Baking soda

A last minute substitute gave a new twist to an old Amish recipe for
raisin cookies. The cupboard was bare so leftover pineapple was
substituted for the raisins. Everyone preferred the pineapple
version. (Editor's Note: We called these Pineapple Muffins Cookies,
because they came out big and soft.)

Preheat oven to 350ø.

In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening, sugar and egg. When light
and fluffy, stir in crushed pineapple with juice.

Sift flour, baking soda, salt and nutmeg together and stir into
batter. When the mixture is well blended, stir in nuts.

Drop by teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Bake
at 350ø for 8-10 minutes. Cool on wire racks.

Yield: 5 dozen. Heather Hephner, Associate Editor, Food & Family Life,
