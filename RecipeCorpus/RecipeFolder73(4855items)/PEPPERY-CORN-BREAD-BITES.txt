I forget what kinds of recipes you like.  Here are a couple of easy
looking cornbread recipes from a new book a friend gave me.

From:  Working Mother 29-Minute Meals

Preheat oven to 425 deg.F.  Grease 8-inch square baking pan. Prepare
corn bread mix according to package directions, adding cheese to
batter. Pour batter into prepared pan; sprinkle evenly with black
pepper. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown and toothpick
inserted into center comes out clean. Cut corn bread into squares.

Makes about 12 squares.

This one also looks good.  From same book as above.

Herbed Corn Bread

Bake this savory cornbread in the morning and serve at room
temperature--or if desired, reheat it briefly before serving.

2 boxes (8 1/2-ounce size) cornbread or corn muffin mix 1/2 cup
cottage cheese 1/4 cup minced parsley 1/4 cup snipped fresh chives or
scallions

1.  Preheat oven to 350 deg.F.  Grease several corn-stick molds or
two 8 inch square baking pans. Set aside.

2.  Prepare mixes according to package directions, adding cottage
cheese, parsley and chives to batter. Spoon into prepared molds. Bake
for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned (corn bread baked in
square pans will take about 25 minutes).

Makes 12 servings.

1 mg cholesterol, 455 mg sodium.

My Note:  Even if you dislike cottage cheese, when cottage cheese is
baked into breads and the like it looses its cottage-cheese-ness ;-)
and just tends to make the breads moist. Also, you could probably add
smidgens of other herbs to this last bread... tiny bits of basil or
oregano or thyme, to give it just a hint of herby flavor.

Take care, Kyosho
