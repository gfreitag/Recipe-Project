NOTES : Peaches and cream for the ginger shortcake. Feel free to peel
the peaches if you like. I find that the skin adds some extra flavor;
and unless the skins come off with your fingers, I find it a nuisance
to bring a pot of water to boiling just to submerge the peaches for a
minute to loosen their skins. Nonfat sour creams vary a lot in
flavor; be sure to select a good one or this dish will be severely
compromised. (I use Knudsen.)
