1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Brush bread with some of the melted
butter. Put bread slices on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown
(about 10 minutes).

2. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, bring half-and-half to a
simmer (bubbles will appear at edge of pan). In a 3-quart bowl, beat
sugar with egg yolks; whisk hot half-and-half into egg-sugar mixture.
Stir in vanilla and salt; set aside.

3. Pour remaining butter into a 9- by 12-inch baking dish. Place 6
bread slices in dish; strain half of egg-custard mixture through a
wire mesh strainer over bread. Distribute sliced peaches over
bread-custard mixture; top with pecans. Arrange remaining bread over
fruit and strain remaining egg-custard mixture over bread. Let stand
1 hour, covered with plastic wrap, or refrigerate up to 6 hours.

4. If refrigerated, remove from refrigerator about 2 hours before
serving. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Bake, uncovered, until golden
brown and slightly crusty (about 1-3/4 hours). Serve warm, cut into
squares and topped with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.
