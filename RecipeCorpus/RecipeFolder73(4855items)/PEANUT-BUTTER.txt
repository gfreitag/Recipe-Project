Title: PEANUT BUTTER
Categories: Nuts
Yield: 2 Cups
1 lb Peanuts, shelled raw
1/2 ts Salt; to 1 ts
1/2 ts Sugar; to 1 ts
2 tb Peanut oil
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Spread the nuts in a jelly roll or
roasting pan and bake them for 20 minutes, shaking the pan now and
then; they should be *light* gold. Cool the peanuts, then proceed in
either of the following ways:

CREAMY:  Put half the nuts in the container of a food processor (or
jar of a blender) with half of the salt, sugar and oil. Process to a
creamy consistency (stopping the action and scraping down the sides
of the container often wih a spatula), then empty the peanut butter
into a bowl and repeat with the remaining nuts, salt, sugar and oil.

CHUNKY:  Use the processor to chop about one third of the nuts
coarsely; se aside, then process the remaining nuts, salt, sugar and
oil to a creamy consistency.  Stir together with the chopped nuts.
Or use a blender as follows:  Do half of the nuts at a time and
scrape down he sides of the container and scrape under the blades
several times. Process to as crunchy a texture as you wish.  It's not
necessary to chop part of the nuts first for blender chunky peanut
butter.

TO STORE:  Store refrigerated, in a covered jar, where it will keep
for about two weeks.
