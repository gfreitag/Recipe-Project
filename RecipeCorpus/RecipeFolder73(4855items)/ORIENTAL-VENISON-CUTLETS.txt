Cervena sponsored a contest involving some of America's best chefs.
One of the finalists was Philippe Chin or Chanterelles in
Philadelphia, with this recipe.

In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium high heat. Sear cutlets
quickly to desired doneness; remove from pan and keep warm. Mix herbs
together; coat each cutlet with sesame oil and herbs.

Add garlic, shallots, ginger, soy sauce and chicken stock to pan
juices. Simmer about 8 minutes. Swirl in butter; return to simmer.
Arrange venison slices on plates and spoon sauce over each. Serve
immediately.
