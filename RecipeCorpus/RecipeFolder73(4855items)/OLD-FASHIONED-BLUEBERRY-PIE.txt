Categories: New text im, Desserts
Yield: 16 Servings
Pate Brisee -- (dough for 2
Pies)
6 pt Fresh blueberries
2 c  Sugar -- plus 2 tablespoons
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
Grated zest and juice of 1
Lemon
1 lg Egg -- beaten with 1
ts Water, for glaze
On a lightly floured board, roll out two pieces of Pate Brisee dough
to a thickness of 1/8 inch; use these to line two 9-inch pie tins.
Chill thoroughly.

Roll out remaining two pieces of dough to form circles at least 10
inches in diameter; chill on a cookie sheet.

In a large bowl combine berries, 2 cups sugar, flour, and lemon zest
and juice.  Fill chilled pie shells with berry mixture. Lay pastry
circles on a lightly floured board and cut a star out of each center.
(Do this by hand or with a cookie cutter.)

Brush edges of bottom shells lightly with glaze, and top with pastry
circles, centering stars. Trim overhanging pastry to within 3/4 inch
and crimp edges together. Chill pies for 30 minutes.

Heat oven to 400 degrees. Brush pies with remaining glaze and
sprinkle with remaining sugar. Bake 50 to 60 minutes, until juices
are bubbling and crust is golden brown. Let stand at room temperature
for about 20 minutes before serving.
