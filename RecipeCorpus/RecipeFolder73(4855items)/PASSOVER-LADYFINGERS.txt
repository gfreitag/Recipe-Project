Title: PASSOVER LADYFINGERS
Categories: Desserts, Passover
Yield: 16 Servings
-SANDI BROOKS WFCJ53B
6    Egg yolks
1/4 c  Sugar
4    Egg whites
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Sifted cake meal
1/4 c  Sifted potato starch
Superfine sugar
In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks with the 1/4 cup of sugar
until light and creamy.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy, then gradually
add the 1/2 cup sugar beating well after each addition until stiff.
Fold the egg whites into the yolk mixture.

On a piece of waxed paper sift the cake meal and the potato starch.
Sprinkle the sifted cake meal and potato starch over the batter and
fold in gently.
Line a large cookie sheet with brown paper. Using a pastry bag fitted
with a round tube, pipe the batter onto the paper to form finger
shapes about 1" wide and 4" long. Dust with superfine sugar shaken
through a small sieve.

Bake for 10-12 minutes in a preheated 375 oven. Using a wide spatula,
loosen from the paper immediately.
Makes about 24.

I would use these to make several desserts that require either regular
ladyfingers or I would line a springform pan with these and fill it
with your favorite mousse recipe. Or you could use them to serve with
a fruit compote.

The recipe is from the Complete Passover cookbook, by Frances
AvRutick.
