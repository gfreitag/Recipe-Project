Categories: Indian, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
2 c  Water
1/4 c  + 1 tablespoon sugar
1 qt Half-and-half
1 tb Grated orange zest
2 tb All-purpose flour
8 oz Paneer (see recipe)
2 tb Chopped unsalted pistachios
Two 3-inch pieces gold or silver leaf (varak), optional (see note)

This version of a popular Indian restaurant dessert sports a
California touch - grated orange peel. You may add cardamom, saffron
or rose essence if you prefer a classic Indian flavor.

Combine water and 1/4 cups sugar in a medium saucepan; bring to a
boil, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat and
simmer for 12 minutes.

Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, the half-and-half and
orange zest in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and
simmer until sauce is reduced by one third, about 30 minutes. Remove
from heat and let cool.

Meanwhile, mix together flour and paneer; knead until fluffy and
thoroughly mixed, Form mixture into walnut-size balls and flatten
into 1/4-inch thick patties.

Working in batches, poach patties in simmering sugar syrup until they
are firm, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn gently and cook 1 minute longer.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer patties to a serving bowl. Pour in the
cream sauce and remaining sugar syrup. Cover and refrigerate for 6 to
8 hours, or until well chilled, (May be made up to 4 days ahead.)

Just before serving, sprinkle with chopped pistachios and, decorate
with gold leaf, if desired.

Note: Gold and silver leaf is available at Indian markets and
specially food stores.
