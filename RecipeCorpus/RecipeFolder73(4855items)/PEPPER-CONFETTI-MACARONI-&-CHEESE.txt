in the skim milk and bring to a boil, stirring steadily. Simmer the
sauce until thickened, about 1 min. Stir in the cheese, dill,
mustard, salt and pepper, cayenne and nutmeg to taste. The sauce
should be highly seasoned.

3. Stir the macaroni into the sauce. Spoon the mixture into a
8x12-inch baking dish which has been lightly sprayed with oil.
Sprinkle the top with bread crumbs. Bake the macaroni and cheese
until bubbling, crusty, and golden brown, 30-40 min.
