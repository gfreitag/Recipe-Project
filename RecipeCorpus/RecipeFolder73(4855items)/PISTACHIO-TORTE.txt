Title: PISTACHIO TORTE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
3/4 c  Butter; room temperature
1 c  Granulated sugar; PLUS:
1 tb Granulated sugar
5    Eggs; separated
1/2 c  Dry bread crumbs
2 c  Unsalted pistachio nuts
-- finely chopped
1 c  Lemon curd; for garnish
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Butter and flour a 9-inch springform
pan.

In a bowl, cream the butter and 1 cup of the sugar together until
light and fluffy.  Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating well
after each addition. Add the bread crumbs and all but a scant 1/4 cup
of the pistachios. Beat 1 minute to combine.  Set aside.

In a separate copper or stainless bowl, beat the egg whites until soft
peaks form.  Add remaining tablespoon of sugar and continue to beat
until soft dry peaks form.

Whisk one third of the whites into the pistachio mixture to lighten.
Then gently fold in the remaining whites.

Pour into the prepared pan and smooth top with a spatula. Bake 30 to
35 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out
clean.

Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 1 hour.  Remove the sides of the
springform pan and continue to cool torte completely.

Spread 1 cup of the lemon curd garnish on top and sprinkle with the
reserved pistachios.

Serves 8 to 10
