Title: PESTO TRAPANESE
Categories: Main dish, Pasta, Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
6 ea Garlic cloves
1 ts Salt
1 c  Basil leaves
1 c  Almonds, blanched &
-- roughly chopped
4 ea Tomatoes, peeled & diced
1/2 c  Olive oil
Black pepper
1 lb Spaghetti
In a mortar pound the garlic, salt, and basil into a paste; add the
almonds little by little and then the tomatoes. When all ingredients
are reduced to a pulp, add the oil and pepper to taste (This can be
done in an electric blender, in which case add the oil at the
beginning. The texture is quite different, though.) Cook the pasta in
boiling salted water, drain, and toss in serving bowl with the pesto
until it is evenly distributed. Serve at once.
