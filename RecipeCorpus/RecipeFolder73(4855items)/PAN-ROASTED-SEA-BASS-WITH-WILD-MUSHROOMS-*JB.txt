You need thick, firm-fleshed fish fillets to take the heat of
pan-roasting; sea bass is ideal because the skin crisps up so nicely
in the hot pan. Tilefish makes a good alternative.

1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet until almost smoking. Add the
mushrooms and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, for 2
minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon of the butter, reduce the heat to low
and cook until the mushrooms are browned and the pan is dry, about 7
minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a saucepan.

2. Melt 2 more tablespoons of the butter in the skillet. Add the
leeks, cover and cook over low heat, stirring a few times, until
tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and add to the
mushrooms along with the chicken stock; simmer for 3 minutes. Season
with salt and pepper.

3. Preheat the oven to 450 B0. In a large, heavy-bottomed ovenproof
skillet, heat the vegetable oil until almost smoking. Season the fish
with salt and pepper and add to the skillet, skin side down. Shake
the skillet to loosen the fillets and cook over high heat until the
skin is browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Turn the fillets,
transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for about 4 minutes, or
until the fish is just cooked through.

4. Stir the butter pieces and chopped parsley into the mushroom-leek
sauce. Divide the sauce among 4 large plates and set the bass fillets
on top. Serve at once.
