This is Bugialli's version of the dish, which I liked the best of the
half-dozen I tried.

Clean broccoli, discarding tough bottom stems, and separate stems from
florets. Place in 2 bowls of cold water 30 minutes.

Bring large pot of cold water to boil. Add coarse salt to taste, the
add pasta and immediately afterward, broccoli stems. Pasta should be
cooked al dente, 9-12 minutes. About 2 minutes after adding stems,
add florets.

Meanwhile, mince garlic. Place oil in small saucepan over medium
heat. When oil is warm, add garlic and saute until lightly golden,
about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt, pepper and red pepper
flakes. Add capers and saute 2 more minutes. By that time, pasta and
broccoli should be cooked.

Drain contents of stockpot. Transfer to large warmed serving dish.
Pour sauce over and mix well. Sprinkle parsley over and serve
immediately. Makes 4-6 servings.
