Title: PARSLIED BUTTERMILK BISCUITS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
2 1/2 c  Flour; divided
5 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 ts Salt
4 c  Shortening
4 tb Parsley, fresh; chopped
4 c  Buttermilk
Preheat oven to 500F.  Lightly grease a large cookie sheet. Sift 1
1/2 cups of the flour and the salt into a large bowl, setting remain-
ing flour aside in a small bowl. Cut the shortening into the flour
mixture with a pastry blender or a fork until the mixture resembles
coarse meal; stir in the chopped parsley. Pour in the buttermilk all
at once and stir with a fork until the mixture just holds together.
Do not overwork; the dough should be wet and a little lumpy. Flour
hands with reserved flour and pull of a 1/4 cup piece of wet dough.
Toss the dough lightly in the bowl of flour to coat; roll gently into
a smooth ball between palms of hands. The inside of the biscuit will
still be very wwet; place biscuit carefully on the prepared cookie
sheet. Repeat the procedure with the remaining dough, flouring the
hands as necessary and placing the formed biscuits on the cookie
sheet so they just touch.. Pat each biscuit gently to flatten
slightly. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until golden brown. Makes about 8
biscuits. Nutrition Information per biscuit:
