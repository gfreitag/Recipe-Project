Categories: Pantry, Soup/stews, Pickles
Yield: 3 Pints
3 lb Fennel (about 9 bulbs)
1 md Orange
2 c  White vinegar
5 tb Kosher salt
2 tb Sugar
6    Whole pieces star anise
1. Wash 3 pint jars and lids with hot soapy water and rinse well.
(You can use canning jars and lids, but you don't have to.)

2. Wash fennel and cut away any bruises or bad spots; trim ends and
slice into very thin rings. Cut three 1-inch-long strips of peel from
the orange. Remove any pith from peel.

3. Bring 1 1/2 C water, the vinegar, salt, and sugar to a boil in a
large pot.

4. Meanwhile, fill each jar halfway with fennel. Place 1 piece of
orange rind and 2 pieces star anise on top of fennel. Fill jar with
remaining fennel, using the back of a clean spoon to pack it down.
Leave 1/4 inch of space beneath the rim.

5. Pour hot liquid over fennel, covering it by 1/4 inch and leaving
1/2 inch of space beneath the rim of each jar. Place lids on jars and
let stand until cool. Store in refrigerator; serve within 3 to 5 days.
