Juice of 1 lemon
2 ts Sugar
2    Dessertspoons Grand Marnier

First make the syrup: mix the lemon juice and sugar in a small pan and
simmer for 5 minutes, making sure the sugar dissolves completely.
Stir in the Grand Marnier.

Prepare the fruit for the fruit salad and toss in the syrup. Cut the
pineapple in half vertically, including the leaves. Scoop out the
flesh from each pineapple half with a grapefruit knife, ensuring that
the flesh remains in one piece.

Put the fruit salad with the syrup in the pineapple shells. Slice the
pineapple flesh and the red apple, dipping the red apple slices in
lemon juice to prevent discolouration, then arrange alternate slices
of pine- apple and red apple on top of the fruit salad in the
pineapple shells. Serve fresh cream separately.
