*Pasta with Marinated Tomatoes, Capers, Olives, Garlic, Chilies, and
Herbs. Author's note:  "This pasta dish would not be the same without
the piquancy it picks up from the capers, and from its Italian name.
The dish loosely translates as 'bad woman pasta,' as several other
lusty tomato and garlic and herb pasta dishes do.  Legend has it that
these dishes are so named because they are very aromatic and lure
customers in when other charms fail. Another explanation is that the
dishes are so quick they can be prepared between customers."

Combine olive oil with olives, capers, garlic, tomatoes, basil, salt,
and pepper flakes.  Let sit and marinate for half hour if possible.
Cook penne in rapidly boiling salted water until al dente. Drain and
toss with sauce. Serve immediately, or let cool and enjoy as a salad.
