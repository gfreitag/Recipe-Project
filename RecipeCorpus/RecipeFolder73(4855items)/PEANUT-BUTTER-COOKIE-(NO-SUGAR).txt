Categories: Low-fat, Cookies
Yield: 1 Batch
1 c  Creamy peanut butter
1 c  Frozen concentrated apple
Juice(thawed-but no water
Added)
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Whole wheat flour (sifted)
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
Combine peanut butter and apple juice in mixing bowl. Mix well.
Combine dry ingredients.  Dough will be sticky. Use a ice cream scoop
to scoop cookie dough onto lightly sprayed cookie sheet. ip fork in
cold water and wipe dry and press into cookies.  (Cold water helps to
keep the dough from sticking.)  Bake at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes
or until lightly browned.

Melissa Mierau's notes:  It really foamed when the dry ingredients
were added to the wet, sort of like peanut brittle. Then with further
stirring it thickened up. They baked into a real nice cookie but only
made about 2 dozen (using teaspoon for scoop instead of ice cream
scoop). I will double recipe next time!
