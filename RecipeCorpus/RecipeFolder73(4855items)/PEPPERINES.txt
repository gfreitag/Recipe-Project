Title: PEPPERINES
Categories: Bakery, Crackers
Yield: 80 Crackers
1 1/2 c  All purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Black pepper coarsely ground
1 ts Sugar
2 tb Oil
1/4 c  Water
2 tb Lemon juice
Preheat oven to 350F. Mix flour, salt, pepper & sugar in a large bowl
or food processor. Add oil & blend until the mixture resembles coarse
breadcrumbs. Combine water & lemon juice in a small bowl. Blend it
into the flour mixture. Add up to 1/4 c more water if necessary. The
dough should hold together. Divide dough into 2 equal portions. Roll
each portion into a rectangle as thinly as possible.  Using a
spatula, rolling pin or your hands, pick up the rolled dough &
transfer to an ungreased cookie sheet. Score into 2" squares, taking
care not to cut all the way through. Prick each square with a fork.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes, turning over after 10 minutes or when the
edges begin to brown. Cool on a rack. Break into individual crackers.
Serve with soups, dips & stews.
