500 g  Potatoes

In Peru, where this recipe originated, the avocados are stuffed with
potatoes with yellow flesh. If you want the authen- tic look, add a
couple of drops of yellow food colouring to the potato mixture.

Peel 12 cooked prawns and set aside. Chop 3 cobs of corn into 4-5 cm
rounds and steam or boil until tender. Steam or boil 500 g of
potatoes until tender. drain and mash very smooth. Mix in tablespoons
grated onions, 1/2 teaspoon chilli powder (or to taste), 3
tablespoons olive oil and salt and white pepper to taste. Cut 3 large
avocados in half remove the stones and fill with the potato mixture.

Put on serving plates and top each half with 2 prawns and 2- 3 black
olives. Add corn rounds to the plates. Serve warm or at room
temperature.
