Pour off any fat from cooking the steak. Melt butter in the same
skillet over low heat; add onion and garlic and cook slowly until
soft. Add remaining ingredients and simmer for a minute or two. Pour
over steaks.

Trim excess fat from outside the steak. Press crushed peppercorns and
garlic into both sides of the meat and let stand at room temperature
for 1 hour.

Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat. Grease the bottom of the hot
skillet with a piece of fat trimmed off the steak. Toss in about half
of the salt. Sear the steak or steaks quickly on one side, then lift
out, add the remaining salt to the skil- let, turn the steak, and
sear the other side. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the steaks as
desired. Remove to a warm platter. Pour sauce over steaks and serve.
