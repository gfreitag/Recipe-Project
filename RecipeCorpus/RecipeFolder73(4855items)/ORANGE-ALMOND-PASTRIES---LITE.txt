Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine orange marmalade and almond
extract; set aside.  Coat phyllo sheets, working with one sheet at a
time, lightly with cooking spray; fold each in half lengthwise.
Lightly coat with cooking spray; cut crosswise into 4 rectangles (6

side of each phyllo strip; top with 1 teaspoon marmalade mixture.
Fold long sides in about 1/2 inch. Beginning with the
marmalade-filled end, roll up jelly roll fashion. Place each roll,
seam side down, on a baking sheet. Lightly coat tops of rolls with
cooking spray.  Bake for 7 minutes. Remove from pans immediately;
sprinkle with powdered sugar. Cool completely on a wire rack. Place
on a serving tray and garnish with orange rind, if desired.  (42
