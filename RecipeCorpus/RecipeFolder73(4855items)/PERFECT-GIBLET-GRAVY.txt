THIS IS THE PERFECT GRAVY by Ann Criswell For each
2 cups gravy desired, use 3 tablespoons fat, 3 tablespoons flour and
2 cups of liquid (meat juices or broth, vegetable juice, bouillon
and/or water). Measure fat into saucepan. Over low heat, blend in
flour; cook until bubbly, stirring constantly with a wire whisk. If
desired, brown fat and flour slightly to give more color and flavor.
Remove pan from heat. Stir in liquid and whisk constantly until
blended with fat-flour mixture. Add chopped giblets. Summer gently
about 5 minutes. Correct the salt and pepper to taste. Makes 8-1/2
cup servings.
