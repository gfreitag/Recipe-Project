marinade, reserving 1/2 cup marinade.

Place ham on a rack coated with vegetable cooking spray in a roasting
pan; stud with cloves, and brush with reserved marinade. Bake covered
at 325 degrees F. for 1-1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer
inserted in thickest portion registers 140 degrees, basting
occasionally with marinade. Remove cloves from ham before slicing.
