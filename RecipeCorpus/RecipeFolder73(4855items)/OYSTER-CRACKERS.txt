Title: OYSTER CRACKERS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
1 2/3 c  Sifted cake flour
1 c  Sifted all purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Shortening
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 ts Sugar
1/4 c  Warm water (105 -115)
Place cake flour, all-purpose flour and salt in food processor bowl
with metal blade.  Cover and process 2 seconds to aerate. Divide
shortening into 10 pieces and distribute evenly over dry ingredients.
Process 15 to 20 seconds, or until fine crumbs form. In small bowl,
sprinkle yeast and sugar over warm water; stir until dissolved. While
processor is running, pour yeast mixture through feed tube in a
steady stream. Process until mixture forms a ball; continue
processing for 2 minutes. Carefully turn out dough onto lightly
floured surface.  With floured, rolling pin, roll out dough as thin
as possible into a rectangle. Fold each long side to center; then
fold each end to center to form a smaller rectangle. Repeat rolling
and folding twice more, adding flour to surface as necessary to keep
dough from sticking. Roll out dough into an 8 x 6' rectangle. Cut
rectangle into 48 (1") squares. Place squares 1" apart, on greased
large baking sheet. With fork, prick each square once. Bake in 375
oven 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly browned. Immediately remove
from baking sheet. Cool on racks. Store in airtight container up to 1
week. Makes 4 dozen crackers.
