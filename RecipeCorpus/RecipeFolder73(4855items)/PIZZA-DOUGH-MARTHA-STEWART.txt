Title: PIZZA DOUGH MARTHA STEWART
Categories: Breads, Pizza
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Warm water
1 pk Active dry yeast
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup warm water and yeast. Let stand 10
minutes, or until creamy, then stir well.

Combine flour and salt in a food processor. Add yeast mixture and
olive oil and process just until the dough comes together.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 1 mintues.
Shape dough into a log and cut into 4 equal pieces. Flatten each piece
lightly with the palm of your hand to form a disc.

Place discs on a well-oiled cookie sheet and brush tops lightly with
olive oil. Cover discs with a large piece of plastic wrap and then
cover with a hot, damp cloth. Let stand in a warm place until dough
has douled in bulk, about 1 hour. Dough is now ready to be rolled
into a crust about 7 inches in diameter.
