Title: PEANUT CANDY
Categories: Candies
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Shelled peanuts
2 c  Granulated sugar
Chop the peanuts fine.  Put the sugar into a skillet and stir
constantly until it is all melted.  Then add the peanuts and pour at
once into a buttered pan. When cold, break into pieces.

The finely chopped peanuts make, of course, a much more uniformly
nutty candy than the usual peanut brittle. The recipe makes about one
pound of candy.
