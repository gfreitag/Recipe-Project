Nearly 50 years ago, during the food shortages of World War II, SUNSET
MAGAZINE deplored the use of canned baby food (always, apparently, in
good supply) as a substitute for scarcer products. Now after half a
century, we turn to baby food once again, this time to recommend it
as a principle ingredient in Maureen W. Valentine's Oriental
Plum-Glazed Chicken.

Why baby-food plums? They're already pureed, saving preparation time,
and they're available all year.

=======================================================
============== ====

Mix together plums, wine, soy, sugar, lemon juice, onion, and five
spice.

Rinse chicken and pat dry. Arrange legs in a 10x15" pan. Brush with
plum sauce. Bake, uncovered, in a 375'F. oven for 25 minutes. Turn
chicken pieces over, brush with remaining plum sauce, and continue to
bake until meat at thigh bone is no longer pink (cut to test), 20-25
minutes longer. Baste with pan juices during last 10 minutes of
baking.

Lift Chicken onto a platter and garnish with cilantro. Skim fat from
pan juices; add 1/4 cup water to pan and stir over high heat just
until boiling. Serve juices with chicken.
