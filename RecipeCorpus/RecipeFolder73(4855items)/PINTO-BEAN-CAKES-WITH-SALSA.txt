Categories: Main dish, Appetizers, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 tb Salad oil
1 sm Onion; finely chopped
1/4 c  Red bell pepper
- (finely chopped)
2    Garlic cloves; minced
1 md Fresh jalapeno chili
- seeded & finely chopped
2 cn Pinto beans (15 oz each)
- drained & rinsed
1/8 ts Liquid smoke
1/4 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Pepper
1/3 c  Yellow cornmeal
Cooking spray (optional)
1 c  Tomato-based salsa
- homemade or purchased
In a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan over medium heat, combine 1
1/2 teaspoons of the oil with the onion, bell pepper, garlic and
chili. Stir often until onion is limp but not browned, about 5
minutes. In a bowl, coarsely mash beans with a potato masher until
they stick together. Stir in onion mixture, liquid smoke, cilantro,
cumin, and pepper, mixing well. Spread cornmeal on a sheet of waxed
paper.  When bean mixture is cool to touch, divide into 8 equal
portions, shaping each into a 1/2-inch thick cake. Coat cakes with
cornmeal. Return the frying pan to medium-high heat. Add remaining 1
tablespoon oil. When oil is hot, add cakes and brown lightly, 8 to 10
minutes; turn cakes over once. Coat pan with cooking oil spray if
cakes start to stick. Serve cakes with salsa to add to taste.
