Refined sugar was scarce and a high priced commodity during colonial
times, and many families substituted tree-sweetnin', bee-sweetnin',
and molasses.

Scald 2 cups milk in top of double boiler over boiling water; then
stir in in a little of the hot milk. Combine the two mixtures and
pour into 6 custard cups; sprinkle with a little mace or nutmeg on
top of each one. Set cups in pan of hot water. Bake in a preheated
375 degree oven for about 35-40 minutes, or until a knife blade
inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove cups immediately from
the pan of water. Chill and serve.

Sherry Custard

Break the yolks of 6 eggs into the top of a double boiler. Add 6
level tsp sugar. Beat with a rotary beater until light and
lemon-colored. Add 6 half eggshells full of heavy, sweet sherry. Beat
again until blended. Add boiling water to lower part of double
boiler. Cook over boiling water, beating constantly, for about 5
minutes or until mixture begins to thicken. Remove from heat
immediately upon first sign of bubble. Cool. Place in refrigerator.
Serve in sherbet or parfait glasses.
