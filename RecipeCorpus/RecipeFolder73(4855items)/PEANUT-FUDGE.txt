Categories: Candies, Christmas, Misc
Yield: 4 Servings
2/3 c  Milk
2 tb Light Corn Syrup
2 c  Sugar
2 oz Baking Chocolate; Cut Up
2 tb Butter Or Regular Margarine
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Peanuts; Salted, Chopped
Combine the milk, corn syrup, sugar and chocolate in a heavy 2-quart
saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the
sugar is dissolved. Continue cooking over medium heat until the candy
reaches the soft ball stage (236 degrees F) on the candy thermometer.
Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Remove from the heat and add
the butter. Cool to 110 degrees F without stirring, then add the
vanilla. Beat until the fudge begins to lose its shine. Stir in the
peanuts and quickly pour into a greased 8-inch square baking pan.
Cut into squares when candy is completely cooled. Makes 1 1/2 pounds
