Title: PIRAO DE ARROZ COM LEITE DE COCO
Categories: Desserts, Brazil
Yield: 6 Servings
4 c  Coconut milk made with 2
-fresh coconuts and 4 cups
Milk
3/4 c  Rice flour
1 ts Salt
In a heavy 2- to 3-qt sauce pan, scald 3 cups of the coconut milk by
warming it over moderate heat until tiny bubbles form around the edge
of the pan.  Combine the remaining 1 cup of coconut milk with the
rice flour and salt in a small bowl and, stirring constantly, pour it
gradually into the scalded milk. Reduce the heat to low and cook,
stirring, until the mixture is thick and smooth.

Pour the pudding into a lightly buttered or oiled 1-quart metal or
porcelain mold or into 6 individual 6- to 8-oz custard molds and cool
it to room temperature. Then refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or
until the pudding is firm.

The pudding may be served directly from the mold(s) in which it
chilled, or it may be unmolded in the following fashion: Run a thin,
sharp knife around the inside edge of the mold and dip the bottom of
the mold in hot water for a few seconds.  Place an inverted plate
over the top of the mold and, grasping the plate and mold firmly
together in both hands, quickly turn them upside down. Rap the plate
sharply on the table. The pudding should slip out of the mold easily.
If it doesn't repeat the whole process.
