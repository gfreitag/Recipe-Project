Cynthia Protas Hodges of Ann Arbor, Michigan, considers a beach near
the lighthouse at the Keweenaw Peninsula's McLain State Park "a truly
beautiful" picnic spot. Cynthia's pickled eggs not only travel well,
but their spiciness also warms you up when the weather turns cool on
Michigan's Upper Penninsula.

1.  In a large saucepan, combine vinegar, water, onion, and salt.
Bring
to boiling.  Simmer uncovered, for 10 minutes. Remove from heat.

2.  Place eggs in clean, hot jars.

3.  Stir undrained Jalapeno peppers and hot-pepper sauce into vinegar
mixture.  Pour hot vinegar mixture over eggs, dividing jalapenos
evenly
among jars.  Replace lids.  Store in refrigerator for up to 7
days.

4.  To serve, drain eggs.  Slice, and serve with sour cream and
additional
pepper sauce or ground black pepper.

Picnic Hint:  Carry the chilled eggs to the picnic site in a cooler.
