Title: PANNEKOEKEN (DUTCH PANCAKES)
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-==========================
Ingredients:

500 gr   wheat flour 1 l milk 4 medium eggs 1 tsp salt
1    tblsp oil 1 tsp sugar It can be hand mixed or put in a
blender. For a blender, combine all ingredients and blend. Hand
method: Put flour in a bowl, make a little hole in the middle. Pour
in some milk in the hole and start stirring. gradually pour in all
milk, making a smooth batter. mix in the eggs, one by one, add salt,
sugar and oil and mix again until the batter is smooth and not lumpy.
The pancakes should be baked in a large wide frying pan (a french
crepe pan is ok too) preferably in butter (or oil, if you don't like
cholesterol). The butter should be very hot. Pour in some batter
(about 2 or 3 tabelspoons) and bake.  Turn the pancake when the upper
surface is dry and bake the reverse side for approx. the same amount
of time.

You can use anythind you like as a filling, use your imagination.
Savoury pizzatype fillings are nice and can be put on top of the
pancake after it's baked.

Classic fillings are bacon and syrup pancakes and apple pancakes. For
the baconpancakes you have to fry the bacon first and then pour over
the batter.  They are served with dutch syrup, which has a thicker
consistancy than american syrup.  Here in Australia they sell cane
molasses, and that tastes almost the same as dutch pancake syrup.

Apple pancakes the same : first bake some fine chunks of apple and
pour over the batter.  These pancakes are great with applesyrup, but
I'm not sure that't available in the States. Normal syrup or sugar
and cinnamon will do as well I reckon.

My favourite is a pancake with bacon and salami and syrup, but I think
that's an acquired taste.
