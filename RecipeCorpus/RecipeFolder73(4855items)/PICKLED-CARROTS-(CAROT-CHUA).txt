Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
3    Carrots
1/2 c  Rice vinegar
1 tb Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
These pickles are often served as an accompaniment to grilled foods
that are wrapped in lettuce and herbs at the table. You may also
substitute daikon, radish, turnip, cucumber, garlic, etc. Peel the
carrots; cut crosswise into 1/8-inch rounds. Combine the vinegar,
sugar, salt and 1/2 cup of water in a small saucepan. Bring to a
boil. Remove and let cool to room temperature. Add the carrot rounds
to the mixture and marinate for at least 1 hour. Drain the carrots
before using. Pickled carrots can be stored in a covered jar and
refrigerated for 2 to 3 weeks. Mote: For a more appealing
presentation, you can try carving the carrots into decorative shapes
before slicing. Yield:
2    cups.

From "The Foods of Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier. Stewart, Tabori &
Chang. 1989. ISBN 1-55670-095-4 This is the very basic recipe that
can be, as noted, varied almost infinitely. I most often see this
done with about equal amounts of daikon and carrot shreds rather than
the rounds.
