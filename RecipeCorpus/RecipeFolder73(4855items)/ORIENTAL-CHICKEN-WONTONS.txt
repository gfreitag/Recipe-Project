Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 25 Servings
8 oz Ground raw chicken or pork
1/2 c  Shredded carrot
1/4 c  Finely chopped celery*
1 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Dry sherry
2 ts Cornstarch
2 ts Grated gingerroot
1/2 pk Wonton wrappers
2 tb Margarine or butter; melted

*Note: 1/4 cup finely chopped water chestnuts may be substituted for
1/4 cup chopped celery. For filling: In a medium skillet cook and
stir ground chicken or pork till no pink remains; drain.  Stir in
carrot, celery or water chestnuts, soy sauce, sherry, cornstarch, and
gingerroot; mix well. Spoon 1 rounded teaspoon of the filling atop a
wonton wrapper. Lightly brush edges with water.
To shape each wonton, carefully bring 2 opposite corners of the
square wonton wrapper up over the filling and pinch together in the
center. Carefully bring the 2 remaining opposite corners to the
center and pinch together.  Pinch together edges to seal. Place
wontons on a greased baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining filling and
wonton wrappers. Brush wontons with melted margarine or butter.  Bake
in a 375 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes or till light brown and
crisp. If desired, serve with plum or sweet-and-sour sauce. To make
ahead: Bake appetizers as directed; cool completely.  Transfer to a
storage container. Cover tightly and freeze up to 1 month.  To serve,
place frozen wontons on a greased baking sheet. Bake in a 375 degree
oven for 8 to 10 minutes or till wontons are light brown and crisp.
