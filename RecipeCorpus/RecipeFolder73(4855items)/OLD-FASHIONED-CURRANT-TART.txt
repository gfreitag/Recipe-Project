FOR THE DOUGH: Beat the butter and sugar with the paddle on medium
speed until very soft and light. Beat in the vanilla and the yolk and
continue beating until smooth and shiny, about 3 more minutes. Stop
the mixer, sift the cake flour and add to the butter mixture. Pulse
the mixer on and off to incorporate the flour. Scrape the dough onto
a piece of plastic, wrap and chill it until firm. FOR THE PASTRY
CREAM: Combine the milk and half the sugar in a saucepan over low
heat. Whisk the yolks with the remaining sugar and sift the flour
over and whisk it in. Beat 1/3 of the boiling milk into the yolk
mixture and return the remaining milk to a boil. Beat the yolk
mixture into the boiling milk and continue beating until the cream
thickens and comes to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in the
vanilla. Scrape the cream onto a clean plate, cover with plastic wrap
and chill. Roll the dough and fit it into a 10-to-11-inch tart pan.
Cut a disk of parchment paper to fit the inside of the dough and fill
with dried beans. Preheat oven to 325F. Bake the tart shell about 20
minutes, until set. Remove the paper and beans and continue baking 5
minutes more to color the pastry. Do not over-bake. Cool the shell in
the pan. Spread the cooled pastry cream on the cooled tart shell.
Arrange the currants on the pastry cream. Bring the jelly and kirsch
to a boil and strain. Reduce to thicken if necessary. Brush the glaze
on the berries. Edge the tart with the almonds and sprinkle the
almonds with the confectioners' sugar.
