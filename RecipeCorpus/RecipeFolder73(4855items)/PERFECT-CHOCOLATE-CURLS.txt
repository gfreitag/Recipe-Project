Perfect chocolate curls?  You need patience and the right tool. Have
perfect chocolate curls eluded you? With these tricks, success is
assured.

The secrets are the tool - a standard flexible-blade vegetable peeler
~ and the technique - getting chocolate to just the right
temperature. White and milk chocolate curl most readily; dark
chocolate can be finicky, though not too difficult to work with.

~=> Easy Chocolate Curls For a quantity of curls, warm each bar as
you need it.  Use a regular oven if your microwave is 500 watts or
less; lower-wattage microwaves can heat unevenly.

Place chocolate, scored side down, on a sheet of cooking parchment or
foil, uncovered, at full power (100%) until edges of chocolate give
slightly to gentle fingertip pressure.  Warm for 15 seconds, check,
then warm for 5 seconds at a time until chocolate tests as indicated.
Total time will be 15-40 seconds, depending on oven's wattage and the
kind of chocolate.

In a conventional oven, place chocolate on foil on oven rack in a
150~ oven until edges give slightly to gentle fingertip pressure, 1
to 1-1/2 minutes.

If chocolate gets too soft, let it cool for a few minutes.

Set chocolate on paper or foil on a counter, aligning a long sdie of
bar with counter edge; let paper or foil hang over edge. Stnad with
your hip to the counter. With 1 hand, gently hold end of chocolate
bar closest to you. With the other, hold peeler perpendicular to edge
and rest blade on opoosite end of bar. Firmly and evenly, pull peeler
toward you along bar, peeling off chocolate to make a curl.

If chocolate strip splays out instead of curling, neaten it up with
your fingers.  Some curls will wrap around themselves; other break
off in short sections.

With tip of peeler, lift each curl to a flat surface tocool and firm.
Turn paper 180~ and repeat to make curls from poopsite long side of
bar. As chocoalte bar gets thin, it's inclined to break; just pull
peeler over smaller pieces.

If chocolate is too firm to curl smoothly, or if it firms as you work,
rewarm in a microwave oven on full power (100%) for 5-10 seconds at a
time, or in a conventional oven at 150~ for 30 seconds.

Save chocolate scraps for other uses.  [Note: I really can't believe
they *really* put that last sentence in. *Scraps*? of chocolate???
Get real.] If made ahead, store curls airthight up to 1 week. A
3-ounce bar makes 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 ounces (1-1/2 to 2 cups) of curls. [
