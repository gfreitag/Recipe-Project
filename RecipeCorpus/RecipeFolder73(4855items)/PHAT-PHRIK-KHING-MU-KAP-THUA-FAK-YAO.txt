PREPARATION
++ place the chili paste ingredients in a mortar and pound until
thoroughly ground and mixed (I use a food processor). ++ wash the
pork, cut into long, thin slices, and marinate in 1 Tbsp. fish sauce.
++ wash the beans, cut into 1 inch lengths, boil until just cooked,
and drain. ++ heat the oil in a wok (or large skillet), fry the pork
until done, then remove the prok from the pan and set aside. ++ put
the chili paste in the wok and fry until fragrant (a euphemism,
really!), then add the pork, sugar, fish sauce, and beans. Stir-fry
until thoroughly mixed and uniformly hot. Serve. The lime-shrimp
flavor is what makes this dish interesting and "savory". I Hope you
enjoy the recipe, and I suggest getting the superb book from: SLG
