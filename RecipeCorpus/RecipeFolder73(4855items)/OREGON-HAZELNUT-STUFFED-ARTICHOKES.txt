Categories: Vegetables, Side dish, Appetizers
Yield: 4 Servings
4 md Artichokes
1/2 c  Chopped & roasted hazelnuts
-(Oregon hazelnuts)
1/2 c  Italian style bread crumbs
-(dry)
1/4 c  Chopped stuffed olives

Wash artichokes. Cut off stems at base and remove small bottom
leaves. Trim tips of leaves and cut off about 1 inch from top of
artichokes. Combine hazelnuts, crumbs, olives, garlic and butter;
stir with a tossing motion to coat mixture with the butter. Spoon
between leaves of artichokes. Stand them upright in deep saucepan
large enough to hold snugly. Add 1" boiling water and salt. (Pour
water around not over artichokes.) Cover and boil gently 35 to 45
minutes, or until base of artichokes can be pierced easily with a
fork. Add more boiling water, if needed. Serve with additional melted
butter, if desired.
