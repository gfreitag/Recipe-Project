Title: ORANGE CRANBERRY MUFFINS
Categories: Breads, Breakfast, Bbs
Yield: 12 Servings
1    Orange (I use a large navel
_orange with thick rind)
3/4 c  Dried cranberries
1    Egg
3/4 c  Milk
2/3 c  Vegetable oil
1 1/2 c  Flour
2 1/2 tb Flour
1 c  Sugar
2 tb Sugar
1 1/8 ts Baking powder
3/4 ts Salt
The night before: Grate the orange rind. Squeeze the juice from the
orange. Mix the rind, juice, and cranberries in a bowl and
refrigerate overnight.

The next day: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Mix the egg, milk and
vegetable oil in a small bowl. Sift together the flour, sugar, baking
powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add the cranberries (with the juice
and rind) to the flour mixture.  Add the liquid mixture to the dry
mixture. The batter will be runnier than most muffin batters -- but
that's the way it should be. Fill 12 greased muffin cups (or use foil
baking cups to line the muffin cups) with the batter and bake for
25    minutes.

These muffins are very moist and tasty.  The rather strange
measurements of flour and sugar are the result of my reducing the end
result from 4 dozen muffins to
1    dozen.
