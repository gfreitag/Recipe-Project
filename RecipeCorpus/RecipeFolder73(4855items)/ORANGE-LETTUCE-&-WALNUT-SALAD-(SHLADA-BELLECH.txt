Title: ORANGE LETTUCE & WALNUT SALAD (SHLADA BELLECH
Categories: Fruits, Grains, Salads
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Head romaine lettuce
3    Navel or temple oranges
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
2 tb Sugar
1 pn Salt
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 tb Orange flower water
3/4 c  Walnuts; chopped
Wash lettuce and section into leaves, discarding the tough outer ones.
Drain; wrap in paper towels to dry. Store in refrigerator until
needed.

Peel oranges and remove all outside membranes, using a small serrated
knife and employing a seesaw motion. Section the oranges by cutting
away all the membranes from the orange flesh. As you work, lift out
each section and place in a small mixing bowl.  Squeeze the juice
from the remainder of the orange over the sections to keep them
moist. Cover; keep chilled.

Make a dressing by mixing the lemon juice, sugar, salt, cinnamon,
orange flower water and 2 tb. of the orange juice. Blend well, then
taste. The dressing should be sweet.

Just before serving, shred the lettuce and arrange in a glass serving
dish. Pour the dressing over it; toss. Make a design around the edges
with overlapping sections of orange, then sprinkle the salad with the
chopped walnuts and dust with more cinnamon.  Serve immediately.

Variation:  Prepare as above, using 3/4 cup chopped dates and almonds
in place of the chopped walnuts.
