Title: PALMIERS WITH HONEY MUSTARD & PROSCIUTTO
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 20 Servings
1    Sheet puff pastry -- 18 x
11    "
3 tb Honey mustard
4 oz Prosciutto -- thinly sliced
1 c  Parmesan cheese -- freshly
Grated
1    Egg
2 ts Water
Place the puff pastry on a work surface and spread the mustard over
the top.  Arrange the prosciutto evenly over the mustard to cover all
the pastry, and then sprinkle with the Parmesan. Lightly press the
cheese into the prosciutto with a rolling pin. starting at one long
edge, roll up the puff pastry like a jelly roll just to the middle of
the dough; then roll up the other side in the same fashion, making
two rolls that meet in the center.  Using a serrated knife, cut the
rolls crosswise into 1/2" slices. Place the slices on cookie sheets
lined with parchment paper and press lightly with your hands to
flatten.  Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Beat the egg and water together in a small bowl. Brush the top of
each palmier with the egg wash.  Bake until puffed and lightly
golden, about 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
