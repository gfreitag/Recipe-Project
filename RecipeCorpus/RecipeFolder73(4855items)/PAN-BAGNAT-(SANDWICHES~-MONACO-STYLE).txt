"Pan Bagnat is the name for this stuffed sandwich in Monaco and in
France (where the name is hyphenated). The fillings can vary. For
example, Bordeaux-born Celine Beteta Wong, who works in the office of
the Consulate in New York, says she also fills her Pan Bagnat with
tuna. It can be a complete meal - great for a picnic or bag lunch.
This recipe is from the late Princess Grace of Monaco, who graciously
shared it with me many years ago."

1. Slice the roll in half horizontially. Remove part of the bread to
allow space for the filling. 2. Divide all the filling evenly among
the 4 rools. Begin by drizzling the bottom of the rolls with a little
oil. Drop some onion, bell pepper, tomato, egg, anchovy (if you are
using it) and olives into each roll bottom (the filling maounts are
personal choices). 3. Season to your taste with viengar. Cover the
roll with the top half. Serve cold.
