Here's one I got from a friend many years ago...  I haven't tried it
for a long time, but it was excellent++good enough for me to get the
recipe and I wasn't even into cooking at the time.

Fry the bacon and save 3 tablespoons of the drippings. Fry onion and
celery in the drippings until tender. Blend in flour, stirring until
bubbly. Remove from heat and stir in milk. Heat to boiling point,
stirring constantly.  Boil and stir for one minute. Stir in remaining
ingredients.

If you feel really racy, dump in a drained can of clams.
