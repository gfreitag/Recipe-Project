Pat Piper or Sonoma, California, sends us her recipe rather
assertively called Pat's Famous and Healthful Low-Cholesterol Salad
Dressing. She first tried a balancing act of 1 to 1 (equal parts oil
and vinegar). But overly tart results pushed her back to traditional
ratios of 3 (oil) to 1 (vinegar).
She then elected to combine predominantly monounsaturated olive oil
with three significantly polyunsaturated vegetable oils, hoping to
bring better nutrition by way of variety. Liking the concept of
variety, she also combined several vinegars.
