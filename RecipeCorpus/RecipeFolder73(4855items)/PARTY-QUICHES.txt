preferred, one single filling may be chosen, but the ingredients must
be multiplied by four.

Cheddar 3. Salmon and Mozzarella 4. Salmon with Tomatoes and Feta
Cheese

Pre-heat oven to 200 C, 400 F, Gas mark 6. Drain the cans of salmon.
Flake and set aside.

Divide the pastry into four and roll out to line four 22.5 cm / 9inch
flan dishes. Spread the salmon evenly over the base of each flan.

Arrange the broccoli in one flan, the asparagus in another, and the
leeks and tomatoes in the other two. Sprinkle the spring onions over
the asparagus quiche, onion over the broccoli, smoked salmon into the
leeks and olives into the tomato.

Top the broccoli quiche with Stilton, the asparagus with Cheddar, the
leek quiche with Mozzarella and the tomato with Feta cheese and
pesto. Beat the remaining ingredients and pour into each flan. Bake
for 10 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 160C, 325F, Gas mark 3 and
