Title: PEANUT BUTTER SATIN
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 2 Servings
1/2 c  Peanut butter
1/2 c  Butter
1/4 c  Honey or brown sugar
1 ts Vanilla
3    Eggs (3 or 4)
Servings:  2

Cream butters, sweetener and vanilla together.

Add  eggs,  one  at a time, beating on high speed  at least 5 minutes
after each addition.  If mixture doesn't whip up well, be sure you
are beating the full 5 minutes, or chill well, then finish beating.

Serve  1/4 c in an attractive glass, or use as a pie or torte layer
filling.

May be sprinkled with carob chips.

I  actually  mixed in carob powder to taste and it turned out even
better.
