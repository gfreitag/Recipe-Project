Title: OREGON HAZELNUT BUTTER COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 72 Cookies
1 c  Unsalted butter; softened
1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Pure maple syrup
2 ts Vanilla
2 c  All-purpose flour
--(unbleached)
1 1/4 c  Finely chopped hazelnuts
--(Oregon hazelnuts)
1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
--(optional)
In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Add syrup and vanilla.
Mix in the flour just until combined, then fold in the nuts. Shape
into two long rolls, about 9 inches long and 1-1/2 inches in
diameter, and wrap them in wax paper. Chill until very firm, at least
2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut the dough into 1/4-inch
slices and place an inch apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake for
10 to 12 minutes, until the edges are just beginning to brown. Cool
on a wire rack. If desired, melt the chocolate chips slowly, stirring
often until smooth. Using a butter knife, spread a thin layer of
melted chocolate over the bottom of each cookie. Place on wax paper
and chill briefly to harden the chocolate. Peel from the paper and
store airtight in a cool place.
