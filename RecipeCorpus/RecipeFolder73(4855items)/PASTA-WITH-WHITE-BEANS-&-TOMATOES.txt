In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the oil with the garlic, onion,

to 5 minutes, add the broth, stirring and scraping to deglaze. Then
add the tomatoes, breaking them up with your hands, and stir in the
remaining ingredients. Simmer the sauce until it is thick but still
slightly liquid, about 15 minutes. Spoon over cooked pasta (medium to
wide strands, ribbons, tubes, or shapes). Note: to make reduced
chicken broth, briskly boil 2 cups of broth until it reduces down to
1 cup (approx.
15    minutes).
