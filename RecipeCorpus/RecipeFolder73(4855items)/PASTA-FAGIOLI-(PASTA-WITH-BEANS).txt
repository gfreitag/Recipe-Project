Categories: Beans/legum, Italian, Soups, Veg: tomato, Out to m/c
16 oz ditalini -- uncooked
Yield: 10 Servings
28 oz crushed tomatoes -- large
can
:
30 oz cannellini beans -- 2 15 oz
cans
:
15 oz butter beans -- 1 can
15 oz garbanzo beans, canned -- 1
can
:
1/4 c  parsley
1/2 ts ground black pepper
2    cloves garlic -- finely
chopped
:
1 md onion

Cook macaroni, al dente (it will cook further in soup), drain, reserve
water. In heavy guage sauce pot or Dutch oven, cook onion and garlic
until transparent in olive oil. Add tomatoes, beans, parsley and
pepper. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Lower heat, add macaroni,
simmer and stir frequently for about 20 minutes. Use reserved
macaroni water, if necessary, to prevent sticking if too thick. Serve
with grated Parmesan or Romano cheese. Sometimes I like mine with
shredded cheddar.
