4 tb Butter, melted
4    8 oz pks soft creamcheese
1 c  Sugar

1.  Preheat oven to 425F. In a food processor, grind cookies into fine

mixture into bottom and two thirds up the sides of a 9" spring- form
pan. Set aside.

2.  In a large bowl, beat together cream cheese and sugar with an
electric mixer on medium speed until light, fluffy and smooth 2-3
min. Beat in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Beat in flour, milk and vanilla. Beat until well blended and smooth,
about 4 minutes.

3.  Sprinkle 4 packages of chopped peanut butter cups evenly on
bottom of chocolate crust. Carefully pour cheesecake mixture over
all; spread evenly.

4.  Bake 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 250 F and bake 40-50
minutes longer, or until edges are set and cake jiggles only slightly
in center.

5.  Let cheesecake cool at room temperature, then refrigerate until
well chilled, about 6 hours or overnight. Run a knife around the pan
edge to loosen cake, and remove. Shortly before serving garnish with
whipped cream and sprinkle two remaining packages chopped peanut
butter cups on top.
