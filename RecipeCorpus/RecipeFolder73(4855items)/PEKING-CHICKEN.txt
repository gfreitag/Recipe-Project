Title: PEKING CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Low-cal
Yield: 6 Servings
5    Cloves of garlic, minced
(about 5 teaspoons)
2 tb Minced fresh giner
1 c  Hoisin sauce
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Rice wine vinegar
1/4 c  Honey
2 lb Skinless, boneless chicken
Breasts, thinly sliced
Across the grain
12    Scallions
1 tb Sesame oil
12    Flour tortillas
1.  Combine the garlic, ginger, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, and
honey in a small bowl.  Whisk to mix.  Set aside half of this
mixture
to use as a sauce.  Marinate the chicken in the remaining mixture
for
one to two hours, stirring several times. 2. Meantime, make the
scallion brushes.  Cut the roots and greens off
the scallions.  There should be 3" pieces of scallion white
remaining.
Make a series of 1" lengthwise cuts in each end, gradually
rotating
the scallion, to form the individual "bristles" of the brush. Soak
the scallions in a bowl of ice water for a couple of hours to
swell
the ends of the brushes. 3. Just before serving, heat the oil in a
large non-stick frying pan.
Cook the chicken over medium heat for 2 minutes, or until well
done.
Set aside and keep warm.  Lightly brush each tortilla with water
and
toast in a non-stick frying pan over high heat (or warm in a
steamer).
Divide the reserved marinade among 6 small ramekins or dishes. 4.
Mount the chicken in the center of a platter. Arrange the tortillas
(fold them in quarters or halves and scallion brushes around the
chicken.  Invite guests to use a scallion to brush a tortilla with
hoisin sauce.  Have them place a spoonful of chicken and the
scallion
brush in a tortilla and roll it into a cone. Nutritional
