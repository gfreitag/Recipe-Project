Preheat the oven to 350 F. In a large heavy skillet, spray cooking
spray (or you can just use water if you prefer), and place over
moderately high heat until hot, but not smoking. Saute onions,
stirring occasionally, until they are soft. In a large bowl, whisk
together the egg sub, bread crumbs, parmesan, parsley, and onions

clean. Makes 6 servings. Variation: Replace 1/2 parmesan with lf/ff
cheddar cheese.
