Categories: Muffins
Yield: 1 Servings
4    English muffins, split
3    Eggs
3/4 c  Milk or half-and-half
2 tb Amaretto (optional)
1/2 ts Vanilla
-l/8 tsp. salt

-Fruit sauce
2 tb Butter or margarine
4 md Peaches, sliced

2 tb Amaretto or orange juice
Arrange muffin halves in a large shallow baking dish. In a medium
bowl, combine eggs, milk, Amaretto, vanilla, salt and nutmeg. Pour
over muffins, turning to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate several
hours or overnight.

To cook, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large non-stick
skillet. Add 4 muffin halves and cook over medium-high heat until
browned, turning once. Remove from skillet and keep warm. Repeat with
remaining muffins and butter.

For sauce, heat 2 tablespoons butter in the same skillet. Cook peaches
until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. Stir in apricot spread and
Amaretto. Heat until mixture bubbles.

To serve, cut French toast slices in half. Arrange three pieces on
each plate. Spoon some of the peach sauce over each serving. Sprinkle
with raspberries and confectioner's sugar, garnish with mint sprigs,
if desired.

One way to cut corners when small children are helping: Fresh fruit, a
favorite preserve or even pie filling can make a tasty topping.
Serves 4-5.
