3 pk Dry yeast
1/2 c  Warm water
1 tb Sugar
1 c  Warm water
1/2 c  Dark molasses
1 tb Salt
2 tb Oil
2 c  Rye flour
2 1/2    -3cups all-purpose flour
Soften yeast in 1/2 cup warm water. Stir in sugar. Let stand 6
minutes or till bubbly. Meanwhile in large mixing bowl combine 1 cup
warm water with molasses, salt, oil and rye flour. Beat to smooth
batter. Then work in all-purpose flour till dough is smooth and no
longer sticky, very pliable and elastic. Knead a few minutes. Let
rise till doubled in greased bowl. Punch down. Shape into 2 large
round loaves placed a few inches apart on greased and cornmeal dusted
cookie sheet or fill 6 mini foil loaf pans, greased and dusted in
cornmeal, with the dough, dividing it evenly between these little
pans. Either way let loaves rise till doubled in warm place. Bake
large loaves 375~ about 30 minutes or till crust makes hollow sound
when tapped with knuckles. For tiny loaves place pans on dry
ungreased cookie sheets, a few inches apart. When doubled in size,
bake at 375~ for 20 minutes or till crust makes that hollow sound
when tapped. Bread freezes beautifully. Source: Gloria Pitzer's
