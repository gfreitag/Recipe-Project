Mort has always craved Philadelphia Sticky buns..the REAL THING...and
I suddenly had a light bulb go off yesterday..so with thanks to Diana
Lewis; (for the GREATEST sweet roll recipe) and my daughter Lois for
her Upside Apple pie...I took the two and put them together...voila
the best sticky buns since we left home...and EASY! The following is
Diane's grandma's recipe..for the Breadmaker...Assembly for bottom
follows.

Make on dough cycle or on MANUAL... This dough also make excellent
cinnamon rolls roll out dough into a rectangle about 1/4 to 1/8 inch
thick depend on how many and how big you want to make them. Take 1
TBL of soft butter and spread all around leaving 1/4 inch of edge.
Then sprinkle cinnamon all around as much as you want then take 1/2
cup brown sugar and sprinkle. You can also add the same amount of
chopped nuts and raisins. Roll up into a log and cut off about 1-1/2
to 2 inches and place in a lightly greased pan. Let rise 45 minutes
and bake 15 to twenty minutes at 350. when somewhat cooled drizzle on
a glaze of powdered sugar, butter, vanilla extract and milk then
devour. Happy holidays FROM: DIANA LEWIS (VGWN37A)

ASSEMBLY: I used a nine inch shallow quiche pan...butter very
well...all over sides too. Place the pecans in the bottom of the pan
and sprinkle with the brown sugar. Put the rolls on top of this
mixture and bake at 375 degrees for about 20 minutes...WATCH
carefully because ovens vary. Cool for EXACTLY 5 minutes and turn
out. HEAVENLY!!! I didn't use the glaze..ENJOY... By Elaine Radis.
