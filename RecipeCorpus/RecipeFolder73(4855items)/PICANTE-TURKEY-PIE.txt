Many thanks to Mary Jane Womack of Merced, California, for this
delicious one-dish dinner. A real family pleaser, the ground turkey
"crust" is filled with pizza-flavored vegetables and cheese.

Combine turkey, crumbs, 1/4 cup of the Pace Picante Sauce, 1/4
teaspoon of the oregano and 2 cloves garlic in medium bowl; mix well.
Press onto bottom and sides of 9" pie plate. Bake at 350'F. 20
minutes. While shell is baking, cook vegetables and remaining garlic
in oil in 10" skillet 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in
remaining 3/4 cup Pace Picante Sauce, tomato paste, olives and
remaining 3/4 teaspoon oregano. Simmer 5 minutes or until thickened.
Stir in Parmesan cheese; spoon into baked shell. Top with mozzarella
cheese; return to oven 10 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve
with additional Pace Picante Sauce.
