Scrub the potatoes and pierce in several places with a small knife.
Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven about 1 1/4 hours, or until
tender. Cool slightly: cut a thin slice from the tops of the potatoes
and coop out the insides, leaving a thin shell. Place on baking
sheet. Mash the potato pulp with a fork.  Combine the margarine and
garlic; brush lightly over the insides of the potato shells. Add the
remaining to the pulp. Mash in the cream cheese. Add the Parmesan,
sour cream, parsley, chives, salt and pepper. Fill the potato shells
and bake in a preheated 350-degree oven 15-20 minutes, until heated
through.  Finish under the broiler, cooking until golden.
