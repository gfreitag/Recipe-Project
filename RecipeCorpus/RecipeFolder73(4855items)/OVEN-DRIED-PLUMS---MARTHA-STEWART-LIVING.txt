Categories: Fruits, Soup/stews
Yield: 6 Cups
4 lb Plums
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Kosher Salt
Freshly ground pepper to
-taste
1 tb Balsamic vinegar
1 tb Olive oil
3 tb Fresh thyme leaves (about
- 15 sprigs)
1. Heat oven to 250'. Cut plums in half lengthwise and remove pits.
Cut halves into 2-inch wedges. Place in a large mixing bowl and
sprinkle with sugar, salt, pepper, vinegar, and oil. Toss to coat
well.

2. Arrange plums on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cut sides up,
about an inch apart. Sprinkle liberally with fresh thyme. Leave to
dry in oven 3 hours. Turn off oven, and allow plums to remain inside
at least 2 more hours or overnight. Plums will be wrinkled but still
quite juicy when done.
