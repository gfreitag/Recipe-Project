Title: PEANUT BUTTERY STIR-FRY
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Vegetables, Stir-fry
Yield: 1 Serving
1/2 c  Brown rice
1/3 c  Tofu
4 ts Vegetable oil
1 sm Onion
1 sm Carrot
2 oz Green beans
A few leaves Chinese cabbage
-OR- collards
1 1/2 c  Mung beansprouts
1 sm Garlic clove
1    Piece ginger root (1/4-inch)
1 1/2 tb Peanut butter
4 tb Water
2 ts Lemon juice
1 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Soymilk
Cook the rice until tender.

Dice the tofu.  Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a wok or frying pan (skillet)
and stir-fry the tofu until lightly browned. Remove from wok.

Slice the onion thinly.  Slice the carrot into matchsticks. Chop the
beans finely.  Heat 2 teaspoons oil in the wok and stir-fry these
ingredients 2-3 minutes.

Chop the cabbage leaves and add them to the wok along with the
beansprouts. Continue stir-frying until just tender.

Crush the garlic.  Grate the ginger finely.  Heat the remaining
teaspoon oil in a small saucepan and add the garlic and ginger. Cook
for a minute or two, then stir in the peanut butter and then the
water. Stir until smooth. (This much can be done before the
vegetables start cooking; the rest should wait until they are nearly
ready.) Add the lemon juice, soy sauce and milk, and stir well.

Return the tofu to the wok, and stir in the peanut butter sauce. Mix
well and serve on top of the rice.
