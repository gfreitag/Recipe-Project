Title: PAPRIKA CHICKEN
Categories: Hungarian, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Chicken, 8 to 10 pieces
2 tb Oil
1    Onion grated
1 tb Paprika
Salt
2    Tb to 3 tb tomato puree
Wash and dry the chicken pieces.  Heat the oil in a pan, add the
grated onion and brown.  Add the paprika and when it bubbles put in
the chicken pieces.  Turn them over in the onion-paprika mixture.
Salt them and cover. Braise over a low heat, turning the chicken from
time to time, for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  The chicken will exude its
juices and if the sauce is still rather runny when the chicken is
cooked, add the tomato puree and stir.  Cook a little longer and
serve.
