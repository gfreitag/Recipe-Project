Stephen Ceideburg
1 c  Sliced red or white radishes
1/2 c  Sliced English (hothouse)
-cucumber
1/2 c  Diagonally sliced carrot
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Umeboshi vinegar *
6 tb Water
Lettuce leaves
* available in Asian markets or natural foods stores, or use white
vinegar

A vinegar made from umeboshi plums lends the vegetables a rosy hue,
that contrasts with green lettuce leaves.

In a medium bowl, toss together the radishes, cucumber, carrot and
salt. Let sit at room temperature
2    hours.

Press vegetables gently in a colander, to drain off liquid. Return
vegetables to bowl.

In a saucepan, bring the vinegar and water to a boil. Cool, then pour
over vegetables. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 24
hours.

To serve, arrange chilled pickled vegetables on lettuce leaves.
