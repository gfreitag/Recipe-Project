Chick-pea Flour Fritters
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
3 c  Cold water
Salt to taste
1/2 c  Chick-pea (garbanzo) flour
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1/3 c  Freshly grated parmigiano
-opt
Vegetable oil; for frying
In a medium-size bowl combine the water and salt.  Add the flour
slowly, mixing well with a wooden spoon or a wire whisk after each
addition to prevent lumps.  When all the flour has been added, you
should have a smooth batter.

Pour the mixture into a medium-size saucepan and bring to a gentle
boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Cook and stir for 12 to
15 minutes. As it cooks, the mixture will thicken considerably. If it
thickens too much, however, and sticks heavily to the spoon or the
whisk, add a bit of cool water.  Just before removing it from the
heat, stir in the parsley and parmigiano and mix energetically to
incorporate. The mixture should have the consistencne of a
medium-thick bechamel or a thick gravy.

Pour the mixture onto a medium-size baking sheet.  Wet a spatula
(keep a small bowl of cold water next to you to dip the spatula) and
quickly spread the msiture evenly to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Refrigerate, uncovered, for several hours or overnight, until it is
very firm. When you are ready to fry, cut it into 2-inch squares.

Heat one inch of oil in a heavy, medium-size skillet over medium
heat. When the oil is hot, fry the _panelle_ a few at a time until
they are lightly golden on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove with a
sloted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt and serve
while hot.
