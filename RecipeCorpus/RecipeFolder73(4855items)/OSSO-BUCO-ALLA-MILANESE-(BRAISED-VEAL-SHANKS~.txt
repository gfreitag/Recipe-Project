in large heavy casserole or Dutch oven. Cook over medium heat 8 to 10
minutes. Add 2 strips lemon peel and remove from heat. Dredge veal
pieces in flour, shaking off any excess. Heat oil in skillet over
medium high heat. Brown veal on all sides. Arrange on top of
vegetables in casserole. Tip skillet and draw off nearly all fat with
spoon. Add wine and boil briskly about 3 minutes, scraping up any
brown bits stuck to pan. Pour over veal. Add broth, tomatoes and
juice, basil, thyme, bay leaves and parsley. Season to taste with
salt and pepper. Broth should come up to top of veal pieces. If not,
add more. Bring to gentle boil. Cover tightly and bake at 350Ã¸F about
2 hours, carefully turning and basting veal every 20 minutes. Garnish
top with more strips of lemon peel. (C) 1992 The Los Angeles Times
