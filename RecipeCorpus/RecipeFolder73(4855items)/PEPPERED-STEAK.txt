Title: PEPPERED STEAK
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Sirloin Steaks, Excess fat
-removed
2 tb Heaped, Black Peppercorns
4 oz Butter
6    Galric Cloves, peeled and
-chopped finely
6    Slices of ginger, finely
-shredded
2 tb Oyster sauce
2 ts Soy sauce
Preheat the oven to Gas Mark 6/400F/200C. Roughly pound the
peppercorns and fry, without oil, over a moderate heat for one minute
or until you sneeze. This should take about two minutes, but remove
them as soon as you get a strong spicy fragrance. In a frying pan
heat the butter over a moderate heat and when it has melted add the
garlic and ginger and colour gently for two minutes. Add the steaks
and lightly brown on both sides. Transfer to the oven and roast for
five minutes, remove and keep warm. If you like your meat well done,
leave in the oven for another 3 or 4 minutes.

Add the crushed peppercorns, two tablespoons of oyster sauce and one
dessertspoon of soy sauce to the butter and cook over a moderate heat,
taking care not to burn the butter. Serve the steaks with the butter
and pepper poured over and some broccoli and new potatoes.
