Categories: Pizza
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 c  Warm water (110-115 degrees)

Ok, let's start with the basics here...pizza dough. For this recipe
there are only a few pieces of equipment you will need to have. Youll
need a large mixing bowl and a wooden spoon (make sure it's a WOODEN
spoon!).

Begin by warming the mixing bowl by running warm water into it. It is
important that the bowl be warmed for proper rising of the dough.

Pour the water into the bowl and sprinkle in the yeast. Stir gently
with fork until yeast is dissolved and mixture is a light beige in
color.

Add the olive oil, sugar and salt and stir gently until well mixed.

Slowly add the flour, one cup at a time and mix into the liquid with
wooden spoon. When the dough begins to pull away from the side of the
bowl, flour your counter area and begin to knead in remaining flour.
ONLY ADD AS MUCH FLOUR AS IS NEEDED TO MAKE THE DOUGH WORKABLE.

When the dough is no longer sticky, STOP working the dough!
Overworking the dough will tend to make it tough after cooking.

Place dough back into the mixing bowl and allow it to rise for at
least one hour.

The dough should now be ready for use. This dough is designed for
"thick" crust or deep dish pizza but will work just as well for
stuffed pizza.

A few tips for making dough...you can use a food processor or mixer
to make the dough but you will find it is better (not to mention
easier) to work the dough by hand. DO NOT use water above 115 degrees
as this may kill the yeast. You can get by with a one hour rise of
the dough but to eliminate the yeast flavor it is best to allow the
dough to go through several rises. After an hour or so punch into the
middle of the dough to cause it to "fall", repeat this process two or
three times before rolling (or spreading if you're talented <g>) the
dough. Be careful how much you "work" the dough, the goal is
