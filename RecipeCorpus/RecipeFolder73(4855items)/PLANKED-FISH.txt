Title: PLANKED FISH
Categories: Seafood, Fish
Yield: 6 Servings  You will need some wood shingles.  You can get them at any hardware
store. Make sure they are cedar or pecan or some other hardwood. Not
pine or something that will give the fish a turpentine taste. Get one
for every serving planned.  And extra for later. Soak the shingles in
water for a couple of hours. I recommend using fish fillets for this
recipe as they will cook more evenly. Prepare the fish fillets, using
whatever spices you like, salt and pepper.

Remove the shingles from the water and pat dry.  Oil one side lightly
in the center where the fish will go. Place one piece of fish in the
center of each shingle. Then you will place the whole shingle, fish
and all on a hot grill or over a charcoal fire close enough to the
heat that the plank will smoke.  It is best to have a heat source
with a cover. Leave the plank on the heat source long enough for the
fish to cook, until it flakes easily. The plank will start to char on
the bottom and edges, this is what smokes the fish while it cooks,
this is ok. Serve the fish on the plank. This recipe is great for the
outdoors where a homemade camp "oven" can be used, no plates
necessary and totally biodegradable. Walt MM
