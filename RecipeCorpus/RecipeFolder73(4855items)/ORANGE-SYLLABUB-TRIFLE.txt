A light, simple trifle: a layer of cake is soaked with fresh orange
juice, then topped with a mouth-watering layer of crme fraiche and
yogurt flavoured with orange rind and juice. Orange segments decorate
the edge of this lovely dessert.

Put the peel and orange juice into a bowl with the sugar. Leave to
marinate. Strain the liquid into a clean bowl and add the crme
fraiche gradually, beating until thick. Fold in the yogurt. Chill for
a few hours or overnight.

Cut the trifle sponges in half lengthwise. Lay them in the bottom of a
small serving dish, moisten with the orange juice, and finish with a
layer of the syllabub. Place segments of orange around the edge.
Chill for 2-3 hours before serving. Decorate with a small sprig of
mint.
