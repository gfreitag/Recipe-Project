Title: ORANGE~ GRAPEFRUIT MARMALADE
Categories: Fruits
Yield: 3 Servings
1 lg Pink grapefruit
2    Naval or Valencia oranges
2    Limes or lemons
- (or 1 of each)
2 c  Water
5 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Cointreau or Grand Marnier
Quarter the grapefruit and remove rind.  Disard the seeds and remove
the pulp from the membranes.  Cut oranges in quarters; remove the
rind and add orange pulp to the grapefruit. Scrape the orange pith
from the orange rinds.  Cut the rinds into fine strips. Cut the
grapefruit rinds the same way.  Quarter the limes or lemons and slice
vertically into thin strips, rind and all.  Remove seeds. Put all the
pulp and rinds into a large pot with the water and bring to a boil;
reduce heat and simmer 20 to 30 minutes.  Remove from the heat and
let stand for 12 hours or overnight. Add the sugar and boil rapidly
45 to sixty minutes, until liquid reaches the jelly stage (220 to 225
degrees). As the water evaporates, stir frequently to prevent
scorching. Add Cointreau or any orange liqueur if desired. Ladle into
scalded jars. Yields about three pints.
