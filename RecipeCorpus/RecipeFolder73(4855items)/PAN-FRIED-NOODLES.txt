Title: PAN-FRIED NOODLES
Categories: Oriental, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Fresh thin noodles
Peanut oil
2/3 c  Chicken broth
MMMMM-------------------PORK & VEGETABLE SAUCE------------------------
2 tb Peanut oil
1 lb Bok choy
- cut into 2-in sections
1/2 lb Barbecued pork strips
1/2 c  Chicken broth
1 tb Thin soy sauce
1 tb Chinese rice wine
-=OR=- dry sherry
1 tb Oyster sauce
1 tb Cornstarch; dissolved in
2 tb Cold chicken broth
BLANCH 1 POUND FRESH noodles in boiling water to wash away the starch
and to loosen them up (about 2 minutes). Drain them well. Scatter the
noodles in a baking pan. Use a pair of chopsticks and your hands to
untangle them as much as possible. Put a layer of the noodles 1-inch
deep in each of 2 large, heavy skillets. Pour 2 tablespoons of oil
and 1/3 cup chicken broth in each. Cook over a low flame until the
broth boils away and the bottom becomes brown and crisp. From time to
time, add a little oil and broth to keep the noodles moist and allow
the crust to develop slowly. This should take about 10-to-12 minutes.
To flip, first shake the pan to make sure the cake is not stuck to
the bottom (if it is, dribble some oil around the edge to loosen it).
Cover the pan with a wide lid. Flip the skillet over, holding the lid
firmly. The cake will drop onto the lid. Slide the cake back into the
pan to brown it on the other side. Add more oil around the edge if it
seems to be sticking. To serve, slide it out onto a plate and use it
as a base for any dish with sauce.

TO MAKE THE PORK AND VEGETABLE SAUCE: Heat the peanut oil in a wok.
When it is hot, add the bok choy and stir-fry to coat with oil. Add
the pieces of pork and stir-fry to heat through. Add the broth. Stir
in the soy sauce, rice wine or sherry, and oyster sauce. When the
sauce is hot, thicken it with the dissolved cornstarch and serve on
the bed of pan-fried noodles.
