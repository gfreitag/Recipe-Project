*DIRECTIONS*

Stew the pears in a saucepan with the water, lemon juice, cinnamon and
allspice until it is soft enough to mash when you stir it with a fork
or wooden spoon and has a texture like applesauce. Remove from the
heat and refrigerate for two hours.

MAKE THE VANILLA CREAM: Combine the yogurt with the sweetner, brandy
and vanilla.

TO ASSEMBLE: Spoon the Pear Compote into small dessert cups and top
with the Vanilla Cream.

NOTE:  This is a version of an old and popular Creole dessert

VARIATION:  Use pear brandy in place of the regular.
