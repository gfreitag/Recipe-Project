Vegetable Oil For Frying
1 In a large bowl combine the first 9 ingredients with enough water
to form a thick batter.

2 Prepare the vegetable as directed below, and dip into batter,
allowing excess to drip off.

3 In a large saucepan or a deep skillet, heat 2 inches oil over high
heat until very hot.  Add batter-coated vegetables, a few pieces at a
time; fry until golden brown (cooking time varies from 3 to 10
minutes). If oil begins to spatter or smoke, reduce heat to medium. 4
Drain vegetables on paper towels.  Serve hot.

Eggplant: Cut 1 medium unpeeled eggplant into wedges. Add 2
tablespoons khus-khus (white poppy seeds) to batter, if desired. Dip
eggplant in batter and fry 8 to 10 minutes or until tender.

Potatoes: Cut 3 large potatoes into thick slices.  Dip into batter
and fry 5 to 8 minutes, or until tender.

Green Peppers: Cut 2 seeded green bell peppers into wedges. Dip into
batter, and fry 3 to 5 minutes, or until tender.

Mushrooms:  Dip 1/2 pound of whole mushrooms into batter. Fry 3 to 5
minutes, or until tender.

Onions:  Cut 2 large peeled onions into thin slices; sprinkle with
salt and allow to drain.  Instead of usind batter, coat onion slices
with besan mixed with 4 chopped scallions, 1 tablespoon chopped
cilantro, and 1 minced green chile (optional).  (You may coat several
slices at a time to form a fritter or pancake.) Fry 3 to 5 minutes
until tender.
