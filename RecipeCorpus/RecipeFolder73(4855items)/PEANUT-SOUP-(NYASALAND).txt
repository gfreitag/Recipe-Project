This is from an old, old book put out for British settlers in
Nyasaland in Africa.  Not sure what that is today... The recipe is
simple and to the point and actually looks pretty good. I have some
other peanut soup recipes++Asian ones++that I'll be posting for you
over the weekend.

Dry peanuts in the oven until the skin can be rubbed off and the nuts
are a deep biscuit in colour.  Crush with a rolling pin, or mince, to
a very fine meal. Strain the stock and simmer with the nut meal for
1/2 hour or more. Season to taste.  Before serving, stir in milk, or
even better, 1/2 small tin unsweetened condensed milk, add a little
butter and serve.

published by The Nyasaland Council of Women. P.O. Box 318, Limbe,
Nyasaland. No date given.  [But it's REAL old.  S.C.]
