Categories: Desserts, Chocolate, Ice cream
Yield: 6 Servings
2 pt Chocolate or chocolate fudge
-ice cream
1 1/2 pt Vanilla ice cream
18    Chocolate sandwich cookies
-(such as Oreos)
3 pk (1.6 ounce each) peanut
-butter cups
1 md Banana
1/4    Container of a 7.25 bottle
-fudge ice cream "hard
-shell"
(such as "Magic Shell") optional: 1/4 cup of your favorite chopped
nuts (peanuts, pistachios, walnuts, etc.)

Needed: 9"x5" loaf pan. Take the ice cream from the containers and
place in two large bowls. Let stand at room temperature to soften
slightly, stirring occasionally.

While ice cream is softening, place chocolate sandwich cookies in a
closable plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin or meat tenderizer
until coarse.  Coarsely chop peanut butter cups with a knife or
scissors. Slice the banana.

Spoon half of the crushed cookies into the bottom of the loaf pan,
then top with 1/4 of the softened chocolate ice cream. Stir the
peanut butter cups into the softened vanilla ice cream, then spoon
the vanilla mixture over the chocolate layer, pressing down with the
back of the spoon to remove any air pockets. Sprinkle with the
remaining crushed chocolate cookies.

Stir the sliced banana into the remaining softened chocolate ice
cream, then spoon mixture over the cookie layer. Smooth ice cream
with the back of a spoon. If desired, sprinkle with chopped nuts.
Cover ice cream loaf with plastic wrap and freeze until firm,
approximately 4 hours.

Immerse loaf pan (careful not to immerse ice cream!) in warm water,
then invert pan onto oval platter to remove ice cream. Drizzle with
ice cream "hard shell". Let stand for about 15 minutes at room
temperature before serving.  Slice with knife warmed in hot water to
serve.
