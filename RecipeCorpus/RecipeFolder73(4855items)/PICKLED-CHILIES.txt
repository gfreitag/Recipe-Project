Yield: 1 Servings
Oil
1 lb Jalapeno peppers --
Washed/dried
1/4 c  Carrots -- sliced
1 md Onion -- sliced
Salt -- to taste
Garlic cloves -- peeled
1 c  Vinegar
1 c  Water
Olive oil
Put 2 tbs. oil in a skillet and add washed and dried chilies. Cook
only until skins blister.  Remove chilies and add carrots and onion
and saute until tender/crisp. Peel and pack chilies in standing
position in hot clean pint canning jars.  Add salt to taste; about
1/4 to 1/2 tsp. to each jar. Add 2 cloves garlic, 4-6 carrot slices
and 2 onion slices. Heat equal parts of vinegar and water; pour
mixture over chilies to within 1 inch of top of each jar. Insert a
dinner knife on inside of filled jar to remove any bubbles; insert
knife in middle of filled jars to remove bubbles there. This is done
by moving the knife side to side. Add olive oil to within 1/2-inch of
rim of each jar. Cover with lids and caps and adjust. Process in hot
water bath for 15 minutes. Remove jars and place on towels away from
any drafts to drain. Let stand 30-45 minutes until lids seal. Test
seals after allowed time by pressing lids. If lids stay down they are
sealed. If not, store those jars of pickles in refrigerator after
they have cooled. Store sealed jars in pantry or under sink or in a
cool, dark place.
