THE DOUGH:-  Place yeast, 1/4 cup warm water, and sugar in a large
bowl or the work bowl of your food processor. Let proof (become
bubbly). Mix in flour and salt. Mix in remaining 1 cup warm water and
olive oil. Knead or process until dough is smooth and elastic, adding
more flour if needed. Place dough in a large greased bowl, cover with
a towel, and let rise for about 45 minutes. While the dough is
rising, place 4 unglazed, 5-inch square quarry tiles or pizza tiles
in oven and heat oven to 450oF. Pizzas baked on such tiles have
crunchier crusts. After dough has risen, divide it into 4 equal
parts, form each into a smooth ball, and cover for 10 minutes. Roll
the dough into 4 small circles, 10 to 12 inches each. Wait 10 minutes
more. Roll the dough thinner. a thin layer of cornmeal or grease
pizza pan with oil. Place one rolled circle of dough on the pizza
peel or in pizza pan. Crush garlic into olive oil. Paint surface of
the dough with garlic oil and

sprinkle with salt. Spoon about 1/4 cup tomato sauce over dough.
Arrange mushrooms, green pepper and onion over tomato sauce. Put
cottage cheese on top (as if it were mozzarella). Sprinkle with 3/4
teaspoon oregano and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 10 - 20 minutes
or until crust is golden brown. DEE PENROD
