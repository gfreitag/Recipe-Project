1. Place garlic, pine nuts and coarse salt in large mortar; then
crush with pestle, using smooth, regular motions, to make a smooth
paste. Add basil a little at a time. Crush to coarse paste, grinding
leaves against side of mortar with pestle. Add pinch more salt and
continue crushing. Gradually stir in and crush cheese. Drizzle in
olive oil and continue working until pesto is very smooth and no
large pieces of basil are visible.

2. Heat large pot of salted water to a boil; add green beans. Cook at
a boil about 3 minutes, remove with slotted spoon, drain and set
aside. Add potatoes to same boiling water; cook about 3 minutes.

3. Add more salt to boiling water if necessary; add pasta and cook
until just done, 8 to 10 minutes. Just before pasta is done, remove 2
tablespoons cooking water and stir into pesto. Drain pasta; toss in a
large bowl with pesto, potatoes and green beans. Serve immediately.

NOTE: Pesto can be made in a food processor fitted with metal blade.
Process all ingredients together until smooth.
