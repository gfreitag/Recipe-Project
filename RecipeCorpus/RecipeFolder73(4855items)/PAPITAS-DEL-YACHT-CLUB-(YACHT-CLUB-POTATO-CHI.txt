Yield: 1 Servings
4 lg Baking potatoes, peeled
Peanut or vegetable oil for
-frying
Salt to taste
1 ea Using a mandoline adjusted
-to the thinnest cutting
-width, slice the
potatoes paper thin, and immediately place the slices in a large bowl
filled with cold salted water. 2. In a deep fryer or a frying pan over
medium-high heat, heat 2 to 3 inches of oil to 375 degrees, or until a
slice of potato sizzles when it touches the oil. Drain the potato
slices, pat them dry with paper towels, and fry a handful at a time,
turning with a slotted spoon until brown and crisp. Do not fry too
many chips at once, or the oil temperature will fall and the chips
will be soggy rather than crisp. Drain on a paper-towel-lined
platter, transfer to a serving bowl, sprinkle liberally with salt,
and serve hot. Makes about 4 cups of chips Mary Urrutia Randelman
