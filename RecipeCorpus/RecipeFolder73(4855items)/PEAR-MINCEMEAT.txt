1    Orange, juice & grated rind
1/2 c  Brown sugar, lightly packed

In a large stainless steel or enamel saucepan, combine currants,
raisins, apricots, lemon and orange rind and juice, brown sugar,
cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and salt.

Peel, core and chop pears to yield 10 cups.  Stir into fruit mixture.
Bring to a boil; reduce heat.  COVER and simmer 30 minutes, stirring
occasionally.

Fill boiling water canner with water.  Place 5 clean pint mason jars
in canner over high heat.

Place snap lids in boiling water; boil 5 min to soften sealing

UNCOVER fruit mixture and continue cooking, stirring occasionally,
about 15 minutes until very thick.  Stir in almonds and rum; simmer 5
minutes longer.

stickiness. Center snap lid on jar; apply screw band just until
fingertip tight. Place jar in canner. Repeat for remaining mincemeat.

altitudes up to 1000 ft.  Remove jars. Cool 24 hours. Check jar
seals. (Sealed lids curve downward.) Remove screw bands (if desired).
Wipe jars.
