Categories: Pasta, Sauces
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------PASTA--------------------------------
3 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
2 lg Eggs; lightly beaten with
1/4 c  Pesto Sauce
MMMMM------------------------PESTO SAUCE-----------------------------
2 md Garlic cloves
2 c  Fresh basil leaves; packed
1/2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 c  Feta cheese; crumbled
(about 3 oz.)
1/4 c  Walnuts; chopped
For The Pasta:

Following the instructions given in your owner's manual, prepare and
set up the pasta machine with an extruder die to make the disired
shape of pasta.

All ingredients must be at room temperature. Place the liquid
ingredients in a glass measuring cup. If less than 3/4 cup, add some
water to make up the balance.

Add the dry ingredients to the pasta machine mixing bowl. Switch the
pasta machine on. Slowly pour the liquid ingredients through the feed
tube. Mix for approximately 3 minutes, or until the dough appears to
be coming together in soft pea-sized crumbs.

Following the instructions given in your owner's manual, begin to
extrude the dough. Cut off the first 2 to 3 inches extruded and
discard. As the pasta begins to come out, gently move it away from
the machine. Cut with a sharp paring knife or scissors at desired
lengths. Place extruded pasta on a wire rack or on a clean kitchen
cloth. Let sit for at least 30 minutes before cooking, or store for
later use.

For The Pesto Sauce:

Put the garlic, basil leaves, and olive oil in a blender jar or food
processor bowl. Process until smooth. Add the feta cheese and walnuts
and process just until the cheese is blended into the mixture. The
sauce should have the same consistency as heavy cream. If too thick,
add additional oil or water, a tablespoon at a time.

The recipe for the Pesto Sauce makes enough for 4 servings when used
as a pasta sauce, which by the way, it pretty darn good!

Both recipes are from the book 'The Ultimate Pasta Machine Cookbook'
by Tom Lacalamita  Simon & Schuster ISBN# 0-671-50102-X.
