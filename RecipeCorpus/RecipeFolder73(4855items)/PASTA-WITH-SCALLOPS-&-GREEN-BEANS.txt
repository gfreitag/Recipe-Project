Categories: Pasta, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Green beans
Salt & pepper to taste
4 tb Olive oil
2 tb Minced garlic
3 c  Ripe tomatoes, peeled, cubed
2 tb Tomato paste
1 ts Dried marjoram
1/4 c  Coarsely chopped fresh basil
1/2 ts Oregano
1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
3/4 lb Bow-tie pasta
1 lb Bay or sea scallops*
*Note: If using large sea scallops, cut them in half.
Trim and cut green beans into 1-1/4-inch lengths. Drop them into
salted boiling water and cook them for 7 minutes or until slightly
crisp and tender.  Drain immediately and reserve 1/2 cup of the
cooking liquid.
Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a saucepan over medium
heat and add 1 tablespoon of the garlic. Cook briefly without letting
it brown. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, marjoram, basil, oregano, red
pepper flakes, salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring well, for about 5
minutes. Set aside.
Bring 3 quarts salted water to a boil.   Add pasta, bring to a
boil and cook, stirring, for about 12 minutes or according to package
instructions. The pasta should be al dente.
Meanwhile, heat the 2 remaining tablespoons of olive oil in a
large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add scallops, remaining garlic
and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring, for about 1 minute,
then add the tomato sauce, green beans and reserved liquid to the
pan. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Drain pasta
and add it to the tomato-scallop mixture.  Serve immediately with the
remaining basil. Source: Pierre Franey, The New York Times.
