3 lg Onions, chopped
4    Garlic cloves minced
3 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
1 ts Dried thyme leaves
7 c  Rich beef stock
1 tb Tomato paste
Salt and pepper to taste
2 oz Gorgonzola

Onion soup is a classic example of caramelization as a flavour
enhancer. This soup gets an added flavor boost from the garnish--a
slice of gorgonzola topped bread.

Cook onions and garlic in a large, heavy, covered soup pot over
moderate heat until they release their moisture, about 10 minutes.
Add butter and cook uncovered, until onions are a rich golden brown,
about 15 minutes. Add flour and thyme and cook 5 minutes longer,
stirring constantly. Add stock and tomato paste. Simmer for 15
minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Place a 1/2-ounce slice of Gorgonzola on each piece of toast and run
under the broiler for 1 minute, or until the cheese is bubbly. Ladle
soup into warmed bowls and float a gorgonzola toast on top of each.
