Title: PASTEL DE ELOTE ('CORN-ON-THE-COB CAKE')
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
5    Cobs of sweet corn
100 g  Butter
100 g  Cream cheese
5    Eggs
Cinnamon or vanilla
Put everything in the blender and combine well, but not to a perfectly
smooth puree, there should be little chunks of corn discernible. Pour
into a greased tin and bake for 1 hour in a medium oven. Serve with
warmed syrup poured over it. This is light, yet substantial, and has
a unique flavour. The syrup can be flavoured with cinnamon or vanilla
too. The corn should be the sweetest and freshest available, since
the recipe contains no additional sugar or starch other than what the
corn provides.
