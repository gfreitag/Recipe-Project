Title: ORANGE JULIUS 2
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 3 Servings
3 c  Orange juice; fresh is best!
1/2 can Cream of coconut, sweetened
1/4 pkg Vanilla pudding mix, instant
1/2    pkg Dream Whip
Ice cubes
:

Combine ingredients except ice in blender and whip. If desired, add
ice slowly until crushed.

Sylvia's notes: Of all the Orange Julius recipes I've collected, none
of them had the coconut I _knew_ was included. This really tastes
like the Orange Julius I've paid way too much to buy. And it is sized
to make the most possible in my blender without overflowing.
