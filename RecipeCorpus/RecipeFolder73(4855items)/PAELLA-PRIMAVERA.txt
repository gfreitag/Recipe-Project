Recipe by: Philadelphia Inquirer, 12/4/94 Preparation Time: 1:00
Place 2 to 2 1/2 cups water (check instructions on rice package) and
turmeric in a saucepan; bring to a boil over high heat.  Add rice,
stir and cover tightly.  Reduce heat to very low and simmer about 45
minutes. Don't peek. You do not want to allow any steam to escape or
your rice won't be fluffy (rice can be made ahead).

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Add the onion, celery, carrots, broccoli, peppers, and garlic. Saute
until onions exude liquid and vegetables begin to soften, about 4
minutes. Add tomato and peas; cook until heated through.

Add cooked rice and about 2 tbsp water to prevent sticking. Cook 3 to
4 minutes or until vegetables are tender and rice is heated through.
Season with cayenne and salt. Server on individual serving plates and
garnish with capers and olives.
