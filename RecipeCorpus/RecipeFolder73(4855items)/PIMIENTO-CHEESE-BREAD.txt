Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
*INGREDIENTS*
3 tb All-purpose flour
2 tb Butter or margarine, melted
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground marjoram
1/4 ts Ground thyme
1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Sharp cheddar cheese (1-1/2

1/4 c  Pimiento, finely chopped
1 pk Dry yeast
2 tb Warm water (105 to 115

3 3/4 c  All-purpose flour (3-1/4 to

1 tb Butter or margarine, melted
*DIRECTIONS*

Combine first 6 ingredients in a medium saucepan; gradually stir in
milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is
thickened and smooth. Remove from heat; add cheese and pimiento,
stirring until cheese melts. Cool mixture to lukewarm (105 to 115
degrees).

Dissolve yeast in warm water; add to cooled cheese mixture. Gradually
add 3 cups flour, beating at medium speed of an electric mixer until
dough is smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a stiff dough.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth
and elastic (about 5 to 10 minutes). Place dough in a greased bowl,
turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85
degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.

Punch dough down, and shape into a loaf. Place in a greased 9x5x3-inch
loafpan. Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, 1 hour
or until doubled in bulk.

Brush top with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Bake at 350 degrees for 35
to 40 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove loaf
from pan, and cool on a wire rack.

Yields 1 loaf.
