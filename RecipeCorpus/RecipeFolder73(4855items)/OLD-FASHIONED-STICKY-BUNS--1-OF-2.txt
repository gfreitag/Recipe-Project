2 pk Quick-rise yeast
2/3 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt
2 ts Ground cardamon; optional
7 1/2 c  All-purpose flour (about)
1 3/4 c  Milk
Margarine or butter
3 lg Eggs
2 c  Walnuts; chopped
1 1/2 c  Golden raisins
Dark brown sugar
2 tb Corn syrup
1/4 c  Confectioner's sugar
About 3 hours before serving or day ahead:

1.  In a large bowl, combine yeast, sugar, salt cardamon and 3 cups
flour. In 2-quart saucepan over low heat, heat milk and 6 tbsp.
margarine or butter (3/4 stick) until very warm (125`F to 130`F.)
Margarine or butter does not need to melt completely.

2. With mixer at low speed, gradually heat warm liquid and eggs into
dry ingredients just until blended, scraping bowl often with rubber
spatula. Increase speed to medium; beat 3 minutes. With wooden spoon,
stir in 4 cups flour to make a soft dough.

3.  Turn dough onto floured surface and knead until smooth and
elastic, about 10 minutes, working in more flour (about 1/2 cup)
while kneading. Shape dough into a ball; cover and rest 15 minutes.

4.  Meanwhile, in small saucepan over low heat, melt 6 tbsp.
margarine or butter (3/4 stick).  In medium bowl, mixed chopped,
raisins, and 1 cup packed brown sugar. Grease 17x11 1/2-inch roasting
pan.
