Title: OYSTER & BRIE SOUP
Categories: Soups, Seafood, Cheese/eggs, Oysters
Yield: 8 Servings
2    Sticks unsalted butter
1 c  Celery, chopped
1 c  Onion, chopped
1/2 ts White pepper
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 lb Brie cheese, cut into small
Wedges, skin off
6 c  Cold water
2 c  Heavy cream
36    Shucked oysters, with liquor
1/2 c  Champagne
1/4 c  Dry sherry
In a large soup pot, melt one stick of butter.  Add the celery,
onions, white pepper and cayenne.  Stir and cook over low heat until
vegetables begin to soften.

Over low heat in another pan, make a roux by combining 8 tablespoons
melted butter and the flour to make a base for thickening the soup.
Cook at least 2 minutes, stirring constantly, so the floury taste is
eliminated. Add the roux and the cheese to the soup pot. Add the
water, cream, oysters and their liquid. Simmer the soup until the
oysters begin to curl. Add the champagne and sherry and heat through.
