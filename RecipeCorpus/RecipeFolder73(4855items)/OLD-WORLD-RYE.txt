OLD WORLD RYE BREAD from Salday Products (vis CI$).

Sour sponge:
1pkg yeast
2 c  warm water
1/2 T  malt syrup or sugar
2 c  medium rye flour
1 T  caraway seeds

Dissolve yeast and malt/sugar in water.  Add rye flour and seeds, and
mix well until all ingredients are blended. Cover bowl of sponge mix
with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 24 hrs, not
longer than 36 hrs.

BREAD DOUGH:
1 T salt
1 c medium rye flour
6 c bread flour (I use some whole wheat in
this amount.
TOPPING: 1 egg beaten
2 T milk Transfer aged sponge to
1 pkg yeast
1 1/2 c warm water
1/2 c molasses
3 T shortening
1 egg
1 T caraway seeds
larger mixing bowl and add yeast, water, molasses, seeds, egg,
shortening, and mix until all ingredients are well blended. Add salt,
rye and bread flours, and mix until rough dough is well developed.
Remove rough dough from bowl and place on a floured counter top.
Rough dough must be further kneaded until smooth. Use a heavy rolling
pin and flatten dough using four as needed to avoid sticking to
rolling pin. Fold dough over and reapeat rolling dough until
smoothness is achieved. Cover smooth dough with plastic wrap and let
rest 10 minutes. Divide dough into three equal parts and roll into a
ball, cover with a container or plastic wrap and proof for 1 hour or
until double.

Remove dough, punch down, mold into a ball flattened at the top and
proof in a covered container for about 1 hour or until almost
doubled. Remove from container and gently place on a peel or cookie
sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. Paint top with egg-milk mixture,
sprinkle more caraway seed on top, cut three lines on top with razor
and gently slide on to tiles preheated in oven at 375 degrees. Bake
for about 35 to 45 minutes until golden brown.

I have seen this made in a bread machine also by dividing the
quantities in thirds but using a couple of teaspoons of yeast per
loaf. Be sure and check your dough in the machine as my memory may
fail me as to the downsizing.
