Categories: Cookies

My mother, of Welsh heritage, was fond of a mid-afternoon sip of tea,
accompanied by light cookies. These were a favorite.

In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add slightly beaten egg,
mixing well. Stir in flour, salt and grated orange rind. Refrigerate
dough for one half hour.

Preheat oven to 375ø. Put a small walnut-size ball of batter on a
lightly greased cookie sheet. Cover with a square of wax paper and
press with the flat bottom of a glass until very flat and thin.

Bake at 375ø for 5 minutes. Cookies will be light brown when done.
Remove from cookie sheet with a spatula and let cool on waxed paper.

Yield: 4 dozen. Margo H. Tyler, Silver Spring, MD
