Title: PEKING DOILIES (AKA MANDARIN PANCAKES)
Categories: Chinese, Breads, Loo
Yield: 6 - enough f
1 1/4 c  Flour
3/8 c  Boiling water
1/8 c  Cold water
2 ts Sesame oil
Mix flour and boiling water. Add cold water and knead into a smooth
dough. Let rest a few minutes. Roll out into a baguette and cut into
six pieces. Use a rolling pin to flatten each piece into a 4"
pancake. Brush each with a thin layer of sesame oil and place them
together in pairs, oiled sides together. Roll each pair out until you
have 6" pancakes.

Heat a dry nonstick pan to medium-high. Drop in a pancake pair and
cook until golden bubbles form on the underside, shaking the pan from
time to time. Flip and repeat for the other side. Remove and separate
pancakes. Fold into quarters and cover with a warm damp towel until
serving time.

This recipe may be doubled. Pancakes may be made ahead and reheated by
steaming (but they're better fresh).
