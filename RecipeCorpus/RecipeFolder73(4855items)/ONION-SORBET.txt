"This is wonderful with cold meats. Serve the sorbet in pretty lettuce
cups, avocado halves, small green pepper halves, or hollowed-out
small (not cherry--they're too small) tomatoes."

Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan. Over medium-high
heat, cook and stir until sugar is dissolved. Just before the boil,
remove syrup from heat and allow to cool. Cover and refrigerate.

Boil yellow onions, drain and puree.

Combine onion puree, vinegar, parsley, scallions, salt, and chilled
syrup and blend well. Place mixture in an ice cream maker and freeze
until sorbet is still soft. Add yogurt and continue churning. (If
using a conventinal freezer, freeze in a stainless-steel container.
Thaw partially, spoon mixture into a food processor or blender, and
process until smooth. Add yogurt and blend well. Refreeze.)

Serve garnished with parsley and/or chives.
