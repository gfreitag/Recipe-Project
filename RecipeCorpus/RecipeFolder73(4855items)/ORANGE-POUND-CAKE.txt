NOTES:

*  A luscious orange-flavored pound cake -- Absolutely the best cake
I have ever eaten! I got the recipe from the mother of a friend. I
think Don's mom got the recipe off the back of a sugar box.

*  If you try to make a pound cake with margarine or shortening you
will end up with a tasteless mess. Butter is the major taste in a
pound cake; even if it weren't, butter and margarine have different
properties in baking, and this recipe is adjusted for butter.

*  Don't make this cake if you don't have an electric mixer or very
strong wrists.  I figure I spend nearly half an hour beating butter
and such when I make this cake. Also, this cake is easier to handle
if you have a tube pan that comes apart into two pieces.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  30-40 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
