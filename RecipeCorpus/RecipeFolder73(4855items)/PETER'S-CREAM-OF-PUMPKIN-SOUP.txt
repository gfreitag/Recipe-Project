IN A LARGE SAUCEPAN, heat the oil over a low fire. Add the vegetables
(including the fresh pumpkin, but not the canned), thyme and bay leaf.
Reduce the heat, cover, and let cook gently for 8 minutes. Stir
occasionally to keep the vegetables from browning. Add the broth and
the pumpkin, if using canned; bring to a boil, reduce heat, and
simmer, uncovered, for either 20 minutes (fresh pumpkin) or 10
minutes (canned pumpkin). Puree mixture in batches in a blender. Pour
pureed soup through a fine strainer back into saucepan and return to
boil. If it seems too thick, thin with a little hot broth or water.
(Can be made to this point up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated,
loosely covered.) Before serving, reheat soup to boiling. Pour back
into the blender and add the cottage cheese and powdered milk. Blend
20 seconds. Taste for seasoning. Ladle the soup into 4 heated soup
bowls; sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the minced fine herbs over each.
Serve immediately.
