Yield: 4 Servings
4    Ripe tomatoes, peeled,
2    De-seeded and chopped

Finely
2 oz (60 g) rocket leaves,
Chopped coarsely
1 tb Olive oil
8 oz (240 g) penne pasta

Black pepper
1. Place the tomatoes, garlic and rocket leaves in a bowl. Add the
olive oil and season well with the salt and pepper. Cover and
refrigerate for at least 2 hours. 2. Cook the pasta in plenty of
lightly salted boiling water for 8 -1 0 minutes until al dente. Rinse
well with cold water and drain thoroughly. Toss the pasta with the
chilled tomato mixture and serve.

Cook's notes: Serve this salad warm - simply toss the hot, drained
pasta into the chilled tomato sauce. If they are available, plum
tomatoes taste delicious in this recipe.

Freezing not recommended You don't have to travel to Italy to enjoy
wild rughetta, a spiky green-leaved plant with a strong peppery
flavour. Most supermarkets now sell rocket, a slightly milder
cultivated variety. If you can't find it, use spinach or a mixture of
lamb's lettuce and watercress.
