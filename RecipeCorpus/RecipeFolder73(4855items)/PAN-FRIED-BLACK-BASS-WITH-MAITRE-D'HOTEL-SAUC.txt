This recipe includes a very simple sauce that enhances sauteed,
broiled or baked fish.  It can be made in camp if you brought parsley
and usually impresses any old "fried fish angler."

Make the sauce first.
In a bowl set the butter out to soften.  Then cream it with a fork
and then a spoon until it is light and fluffy. Work in the salt and
pepper.
Mix the smashed garlic and the lemon juice, then work this liquid
into the butter.  Take a bit of time to do this.
Mix in the parsley and serve in a gravy boat with a spoon.
Pan fry the bass remembering to brown the fish on both sides but
not to over cook.
Serve hot on hot plates and pass the sauce.
