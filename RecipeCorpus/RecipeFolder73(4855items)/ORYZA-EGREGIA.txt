MMMMM-----------------ROMULAN BAKED RICE PUDDING----------------------
1 c  Raw rice

1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Cinnamon

In a 2 quart saucepan, cook the rice with the salt, 1 tablespoon
butter and the water until it is tender and the water is all
absorbed. Stir and fluff the rice in the pan, then add the 4
tablespoons of butter, walnuts, sugar, orange rind and cinnamon. Put
the eggs and milk in a small bowl and beat them together. Add them to
the rice mixture, mix well and put in greased baking dish. Cover and
