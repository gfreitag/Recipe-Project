Title: PICKLED HORSERADISH SAUCE
Categories: Condiments, Canning
Yield: 2 Half-pints
2 c  Freshly grated horseradish
-(2 cups = 3/4 pound)
1 c  White vinegar (5 percent)
1/2 ts Canning or pickling salt
1/4 ts Powdered ascorbic acid
Yield: About 2 half-pints

Procedure: The pungency of fresh horseradish fades within 1 to 2
months, even when refrigerated. Therefore, make only small quantities
at a time. Wash horseradish roots thoroughly and peel off brown outer
skin. The peeled roots may be grated in a food processor or cut into
small cubes and put through a food grinder. Combine ingredients and
fill into sterile jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Seal jars tightly
and store in a refrigerator.
