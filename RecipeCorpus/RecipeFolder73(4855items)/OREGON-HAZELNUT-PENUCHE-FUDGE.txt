Title: OREGON HAZELNUT PENUCHE FUDGE
Categories: Candy
Yield: 1 Batch
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Brown sugar
2 tb Water
1/3 c  Dark corn syrup
2 tb Butter, browned
1/2 c  Evaporated milk
1/4 c  Marshmallow topping
3/4 c  Oregon hazelnuts
-- roasted & chopped
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Vanilla
Put sugars, water and syrup into a pot and stir over medium heat.
When the batch boils up, wash the sugar crystals from the sides of
the pot and the stirring paddle, then add the butter. When the batch
boils up again, start slowly adding the milk a little at a time. Keep
the batch boiling and stir vigorously. (It should take 3 to 4 minutes
to add all of the milk.) When milk has been added, put in
thermometer. Keep stirring and cook to 240 degrees.

Pour the batch out onto the baking sheet, which should be moistened
lightly with water (by wiping with moist cloth), just before the
batch is poured on. Let the batch cool until it is just warm. Cream
the batch. When it starts getting opaque and dull, shortly before
setting up, add the marshmallow topping. Cream the batch 1 to 2
minutes longer and mix in the nuts, salt and flavoring. Spread the
batch about 3/4-inch thick in a lightly greased, wax paper-lined
baking pan (approximately 8"x12"x12"). Let cool a nd set completely.
Remove from pan, cut into squares and wrap in wax paper or foil, or
keep in a closed jar or tin.
