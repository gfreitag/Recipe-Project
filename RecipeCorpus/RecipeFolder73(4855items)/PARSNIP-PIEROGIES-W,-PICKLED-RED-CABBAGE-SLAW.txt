1. To make red-cabbage slaw, whisk together vinegar, sugar, and
caraway seeds in a medium bowl. Toss in cabbage. Season with salt and
pepper. Let marinate for at least i hour, or up to overnight.

2. To make pierogi dough, whisk together egg, milk, sour cream, and
water. Stir in flour a little at a time until dough comes together.
Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth and
elastic, up to 10 minutes. Incorporate more flour if dough is too
sticky. Cover dough with plastic wrap and allow to rest for 1 hour.

3. To make filling, place parsnips in a medium saucepan and cover with
cold, salted water. Bring to a boil and simmer until tender, 20 to 25
minutes. Drain and put through a food mill to puree.

4. In a small saute pan, cook shallots in butter until soft, 1 to 2
minutes. Stir into puree and add nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste.
Remove from heat and let cool slightly then mix in horseradish and
cheese.

5. On a lightly floured board, roll out dough to 1/8 inch. Cut out
circles using a 3/4-inch-round cutter. Set circles aside on a floured
tray. Place a round T of filling on each circle. Lightly wet edges,
fold over, and seal by pinching.

6. To make sauteed apples, heat a medium saute pan over medium-high
heat. Melt butter, add apple slices, and toss to coat. Add sugar and
toss again to coat evenly. Cook until brown, about 5 minutes.

7. When ready to serve, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add
pierogies and boil for 5 minutes after they float to the surface;
drain. Pierogies can be eaten right away or browned in a small amount
of butter. Serve with red-cabbage slaw and sauteed apples.
