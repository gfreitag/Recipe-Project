Categories: Ethnic, Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 ea Shrimp; prawns - raw
1 1/2 ea Clams; live
3 lb Chicken;- cut frying up and
1/3 c  Olive oil
2 ea Lg Onion;- chopped
4 c  Garlic; mashed to a paste
1/4 ts Saffron; spanish
2 ts Salt
2 c  Rice; uncooked
6 c  Hot water
1 c  Sweet red pimientos
lb   chorizo sausages - casings removed
OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS. 1/2
and meat crumbled then fried for about 15 mins. in separate pan.
Drain 3/4 lbs pork shoulder--cubed and well browned in separate pan.
Drop raw prawns into boiling salted water and cook until they turn
red. Drain, peel and dive in. Set aside. Scrub live clams in several
baths of cold water to be sure all the sand is washed away. Do not
open shells. Pour 1/2 of the olive oil into a frying pan and slowly
brown chicken pieces. Into a Dutch oven pour the remaining olive oil
and saute' the onions and garlic until tender but not brown over low
heat. Add prawns, clams, chicken, saffron, salt and rice (plus
optional if used. The more the merrier). Add water and simmer gently,
uncovered, until the rice is cooked. About 35-45 mins. If it becomes
too dry before the rice is cooked, a little more water may be added,
but DO NOT stir. If some moisture remains when rice is done, put pan
into a oven to dry out. Arrange strips of pimento on top and serve in
the pan in which it was cooked. The latter is why it is important to
carefully plan your cooking vessel. Hope you enjoy this. It comes
from Sunset Magazine who seem to always hit the target. BTW, I would
guess that the beans and peppers were used as fillers as generally
they are not mentioned in any recipe I have seen.
