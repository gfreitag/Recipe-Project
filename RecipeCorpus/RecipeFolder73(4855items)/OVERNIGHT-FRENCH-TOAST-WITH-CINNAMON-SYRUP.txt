Recipe by: mary curtis <mcurtis@TSO.CIN.IX.NET> French Toast: In a
medium-sized bowl, whisk together egg, egg whites, milk, sugar,
vanilla, cinnamon and baking powder until well blended.

Place bread slices in a large, shallow baking dish and pour egg
mixture over the top; turn to coat evenly. Press a piece of wax paper
directly on the bread to cover it, then cover dish with plastic wrap.
Refrigerate overnight.

To make cinnamon syrup:  In a small saucepan, stir together sugar,
corn syrup, cinnamon and 1/4 cup water. Bring the mixture to a boil
over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. Boil for 2 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in evaporated skim milk. Let cool; transfer
to a small pitch (The syrup can be stored, covered, in the
refrigerator for up to 1 week. I desired warm before serving.)

To cook French toast:  Heat 1 tsp of the oil and 1/2 tsp of the
butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add four
of the soaked bre slices to the pan and cook until golden on both
sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to a platter and keep warm
in a warm oven. Cook the remaini slices in the same manner, using the
remaining 1 tsp oil and 1/2 tsp butter

Serve with cinnamon syrup.
