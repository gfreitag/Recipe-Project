Title: PICKLING OLIVES
Categories: Greek, Preserves
Yield: 1 Servings  This is the home method of preserving olives when dry salting is not
convenient.

If green and ripe olives are mixed together, it is necessary to
separate them since the ripe olives take less time to treat.

1.  Wash olives well and cut 3 slits in each with a very sharp,
fine-bladed stainless steel knife, or (better still) use a razor
blade so that the flesh is not bruised.

2.  Put olives into glass jars or crocks and cover with cold water.

3.  Place a small plate on top to keep olives submerged.

4.  Pour water off carefully each day and replace with fresh water,
without disturbing olives too much -- do this for 3 days for ripe
olives, 5 for green.

5.  Pour off and measure the last lot of water to acertain amount of
brine required.

6.  Measure that quantity of fresh, warm water into a pan and dissolve
enough coarse pickling salt in it so that when an egg is immersed, an
area about an inch in diameter breaks the surface. Approximate
quantities of salt and water are as follows:

100 g salt to 1 litre water   -OR-
**

4 oz salt to 1 Imperial pint water  -OR-
**

3-1/4 oz salt to 1 U.S. pint water
**

7.  Bring brine to the boil then cool thoroughly before pouring over
olives.

8.  Flat 1/2 cup olive oil on top of each jar or crock and seal.

The olives can remain indefinitely, but black olives should be ready
for eating in 6-8 weeks, green olives in 2-3 months. Olives are ready
for use when bitterness has gone.

TO PREPARE FOR THE TABLE: ========================= Remove enough
olives for 1 month's requirements. Drain well and put into a jar.
Cover with vinegar, add 1-2 cut cloves of garlic and float 1
tablespoon olive oil on top.  Leave for 1 week before using.
