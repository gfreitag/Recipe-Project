Categories: Fish, Dkuhnen msn
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/4 lb Salmon fillet, skin on, cut
Into 4 equal peices
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/3 c  Minced fresh chives
3    Sprigs of fresh tarragon
1 ts Butter
2    Ripe plum tomatoes, seeded
And chopped
Fresh chives to garnish
Preheat a 12" cast iron skillet for about 4 minutes over medium-high
heat. Preheat the broiler, moving the top oven rack to 4" from the
element. Place salmon fillets in the skillet, with the skin side
down. Sprinkle the other side of the fillets evenly with freshly
ground pepper. Cook without turning the fillets for around 6 minutes.
Place the skillet under the broiler for about 3 minutes, or until
salmon is lightly browned. Don't let the salmon dry out. While
cooking the salmon, place wine in a small saucepan and simmer for
about a minute.  Add the minced chives, tarragon and butter. Stir
well. As soon as the butter melts, add the tomatoes for about 30
seconds.  Add salt and pepper to taste. Remove the tarragon. Spoon
the sauce over the fillets evenly. Garnish with the chives. Source:
