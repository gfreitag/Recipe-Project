Title: PATIENCE LOAF
Categories: Candies
Yield: 24 Servings
2 c  Milk
4 c  Sugar; divided
1 tb Butter
Pecans; chopped
Put the milk in a large stew pan and place over the fire. In another
vessel melt one cup of sugar and when melted add to milk and stir
until thoroughly dissolved, then add remaining sugar and the butter.
Cook until a small amount dropped in water will form a good firm
ball, one that can be rolled between the fingers. Remove from fire,
reserving 1/2 cup of the hot syrup (which is kept in hot water until
needed) for a few minutes or until it cools a little.  Beat until
creamy, roll in a damp cloth like date loaf and when stiff enough to
hold its shape, spread with the hot syrup and roll it in chopped
pecans.
