Categories: Miamiherald, Pasta, Lf
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Kale or other greens; washed
-and trimmed
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Garlic; minced
1    Dried hot pepper (opt)
4 tb Parsley; minced
Salt and pepper to taste
1 lb Ziti, elbow macaroni, twists
-or bowties
2 c  Cooked chickpeas; drained
Set a large pot of water to boil, and add salt.  Cut the kale stems
into 2-3 inch pieces; chop the leaves coarsely and set aside. Boil
the stems until they are nearly tender; then, add the greens. Cook
until kale is quite tender but stillbright green.  Scoop it out with
a slotted spoon, place in a bowl of ice water, and keep pot boiling.
When the kale cools, squeeze out excess water, gather it into a mass
and chop rather finely. Meanwhile, place olive oil in a large skillet
over very low heat, and add the garlic and hot pepper if using. Cook
slowly until the garlic becomes golden brown, then add 2 tablespoons
of the parsley and salt and pepper to taste.  Remove the hot pepper,
and remove the pan from the heat. WQhile garlic is cooking, cook the
pasta, tasting frequently to make sure it does not overcook.  When it
is done, drain it. Warm the garlic mixture over medium heat, and add
the cooked pasta, the chickpeas and the chopped kale. Toss well,
taste for seasoning, garnish with parsley and serve immediately.
