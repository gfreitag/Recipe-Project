Title: PAT'S FAMOUS PASTA SAUCE
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 Large pot!
4 qt Tomatoes
1    30 oz jar Spaghetti Sauce
1 cn 20 oz tomato sauce
3 cn Tomato paste
4 tb Italian seasoning
1/2 ts Ground sage
2 ts Garlic powder or salt
1 tb Oregano
1 ts Parsley
2 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Romano cheese, grated
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
NOTE: It is best to use fresh canned tomatoes and when you use the
spaghetti sauce, the thicker the better (we use Prego). In a very
LARGE pot, using a vegetable mill, grind tomatoes to remove seeds and
hard pulp. Pour the tomato sauce and spaghetti sauce in the mill, and
process it.If the tomatoes you added were watery, you might want to
add a second jar/can of spaghetti sauce. Clean the jars out with
water. The point you are trying to do is to retain as much of the
essence of the ground whole tomatoes as possible. Discard the debris.
Add the tomato paste directly to the tomato mixture. (Note, clean the
cans of paste as best as possible... you want them to be very clean.)
Mix well. Salt and pepper to taste. Add all spices and the cheeses
and mix well. Cover and place on very low heat. If you wish to add
meatballs to the sauce while it is cooking now is the time to make
them. Once made, add them directly to the sauce. As it cooks you may
want to adjust the spices and the cheeses depending on your tastes.
We add at least another tablespoon of oregano, 2 table- spoons of
parsley, a little more salt, and at least another 1/2 cup each of
romano and parmesan cheeses. Stir every half hour or so to prevent
scorching on the bottom of the pot. When the sauce is cooked down to
your taste (and the meatballs are done to your liking), remove from
heat and let sit for 1/2 hour.
