This dessert is a stand out and it's so simple too. The sauce, made
with red wine and apple juice, adds to the flavor and to the
presentation.

HEAT WINE, apple juice, cinnamon sticks and nutmeg to simmering in
large skillet; add pear halves with cut sides-down. Simmer, covered,
until pears are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Carefully remove pears to
serving dishes; discard spices. Heat wine mixture to boiling.

MIX CORNSTARCH and cold water; stir into boiling mixture. Boil,
stirring constantly, until thickened.

REMOVE FROM HEAT, let stand 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in NutraSweet
Spoonful; spoon sauce around pears. Garnish with mint sprigs.
