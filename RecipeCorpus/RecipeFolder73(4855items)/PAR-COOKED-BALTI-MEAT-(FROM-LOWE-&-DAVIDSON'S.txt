Title: PAR-COOKED BALTI MEAT (FROM LOWE & DAVIDSON'S
Categories: Balti, Indian, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Boned lamb, cut into 1-inch
-cubes
2    Onions, chopped
3 tb Vegetable oil
2    Small tomatoes, chopped
5 ts Balti spice mix
2 ts Turmeric powder
1/2    Green pepper, seeded and
-chopped
1    1-inch cube fresh ginger,
-peeled
1/2 ts Chili powder
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Garam masala
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F.  Fry the onions in the oil in a
flameproof casserole until translucent.  Add all other ingredients
except the meat, and 1/2 UK pint / 300ml water. Bring to a boil: add
the meat.

Put the casserole in the oven and braise the meat for 45 minutes,
checking every 10 minutes to give it a stir and make sure there's
enough water. When the meat is tender on the outside but still a
little pink inside, take it out with a slotted spoon.  Let the
contents of the casserole cool a little. Then empty the contents into
a blender or food processor and liquidize. This becomes your basic
Balti sauce, and should be the consistency of thick soup.

The meat is now ready for its final cooking in the balti.
