This is a delcious Suffolk alternative to the more usual pigs head
brawn. Dust the jointed oxtail with seasoned flour. Melt the butter
in a saucepan and fry the oxtail until lightly browned on all sides.
Add the onion, herbs, seasoning and vinegar, then add sufficient cold
water to cover. Bring to the boil, cover, and simmer for about 4
hours, until the meat leaves the bones. Gool, then chop the meat,
reserving both the bones and the liquid, but discarding the herbs and
onion. Butter a pudding basin. Hard-boil the egg, shell and slice;
arrange the slices decoratively in the base of the basin. Add the
meat. Boil the bones until the liquid has been reduced to about 1/2
pint. Cool slightly, then strain into the basin. Cover with a plate
or saucer and put in the refrigera- tor to set. Turn out when
completely cold and set and serve sliced, with salad or boiled
potatoes and green peas.
