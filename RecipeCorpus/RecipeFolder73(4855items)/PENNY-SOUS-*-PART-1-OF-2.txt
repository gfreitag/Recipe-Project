24    Whole Virginia peanuts
-unsalted, shelled
1/2 c  Heavy cream
6 tb Creamy peanut butter
14 oz Semi-sweet chocolate;
-broken into 1/2 oz pieces
Equipment: 3 baking sheets with sides, film wrap, instant-read test
thermometer, cake spatula, 1 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, parchment
paper, pastry bag, medium straight tip

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast the peanuts on a baking sheet
in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 6 to 7 minutes.
Remove the peanuts from the oven and set aside until needed.

Heat the heavy cream and the peanut butter in a 1 1/2-qt saucepan over
medium-high heat. Stir with a whisk to combine thoroughly. Bring the
mixture to a boil. Place 6 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate in a
stainless steel bowl. Pour the boiling cream and peanut butter
mixture over the chocolate, and allow to stand at room temperature
for 5 minutes. Stir until smooth. Refrigerate the peanut butter
ganache for 30 minutes.

Cover the bottom of a baking sheet with film wrap. Heat 1 inch of
water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. Place
the remaining 8 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate in the top half. Heat
the chocolate uncovered, while stirring constantly, until it has
melted, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the melted chocolate to a
stainless steel bowl, and continue to stir until the temperature of
the chocolate is reduced to 90 degrees, about 5 minutes.
