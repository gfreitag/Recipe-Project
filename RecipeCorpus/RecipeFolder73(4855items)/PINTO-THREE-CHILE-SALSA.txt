Heat olive oil & saute the onion over medium-high heat until
caramelized. Transfer to a blender along with the chiles (not the
jalapeno chiles), garlic, tomatoes, beer & puree. In a wok or large
skillet, heat peanut oil until smoking hot & add the puree. Re-fry
until reduced & thickened, this will take about 5 minutes. Transfer
3/4 of this re-fried mixture to a mixing bowl & add beans & cider
vinegar.  Garnish with jalapeno.
