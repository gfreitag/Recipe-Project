Title: PICKLED GARLIC
Categories: Condiments, Wine
Yield: 6 Jars
2 lb Large garlic heads
1/3 lb Fresh ginger; peeled and
Thinly sliced
1 c  Coarse salt
7    Dried red chilies
2 c  White wine vinegar
1 c  Dry white wine
2 1/2 tb Mustard seed
Combine garlic in large saucepan with enough water to cover. Place
over medium high heat and bring to a boil. Let boil for 2 minutes.
Drain thoroughly.  When cool enough to handle, peel each clove
without crushing. Transfer to a non-metallic bowl.  Add ginger and
salt with enough water to cover.  Refrigerate mixture for 2 days.

Drain garlic mixture and rinse thoroughly in cold water. Drain again.
Pack ginger and garlic evenly into 7 clean hot half-pint jars to 1/2
inch from the top. Add 1 chili to each jar. Combine vinegar, wine and
mustard seed in medium saucepan and bring to rapid boil over high
heat. Ladle enough hot brine to cover garlic mixture.

Run a plastic knife or spatula between mixture and jar to release any
air bubbles.  Clean rim and threads of jar with damp cloth. Seal with
new, scalded, very hot lid. Repeat with remaining jars. Transfer jars
to gently simmering water bath (180-190 degrees) and process for 10
minutes. Let cool on rack.  Check for seal. Store in cool dry place.
