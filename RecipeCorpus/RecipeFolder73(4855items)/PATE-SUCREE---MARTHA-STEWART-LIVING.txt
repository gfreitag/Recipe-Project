Title: PATE SUCREE - MARTHA STEWART LIVING
Categories: Soup/stews
Yield: 2 Tartsworth
2 1/2 c  All-Purpose flour
3 tb Sugar
1/2 lb (2 sticks) cold unsalted
-butter, cut into small
-pieces
4 tb Ice water
2 lg Egg yolks
1. Place flour and sugar in the bowl of a food processor. Add butter
and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal, about 10 seconds (if
you don't have a food processor, cut in butter with a pastry cutter).
In a small bowl, beat together ice water and egg yolks. With the food
processor running, add liquid to flour mixture drop by drop, until
dough just holds together without being wet or sticky. (You may not
need all the liquid. Do not overprocess.)

2. Turn dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Flatten dough
into a circle and wrap. Chill for at least an hour, or until ready to
serve.

MAKES ENOUGH FOR TWO 8-TO-10-INCH TARTS
