Title: PARISIAN GNOCCHI
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 40 Servings
1 c  1% low-fat milk
1 tb Margarine
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  All-purpose flour
2    Eggs
2    Egg whites
Combine first 3 ingredients in a large saucepan; bring to a boil over
medium heat, stirring frequently. Remove from heat; gradually add
flour, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon until mixture leaves
sides of pan and forms a ball. (Dough will be dry and crumbly.) Let
cool 3 minutes.

Add eggs and egg whites, one at a time, beating after each addition.
(Dough will not be smooth.) Spoon dough into a pastry bag fitted with
a 1/2-inch round tip; set aside.

Bring 14 cups of water to a boil in a large Dutch oven. Pipe half of
dough directly into boiling water, cutting dough with a sharp knife
every 2 inches to form 20 gnocchi. Cook 2-1/2 minutes. Remove gnocchi
with a slotted spoon, and place in a colander to drain; repeat
procedure with remaining dough.  Yield: 40 gnocchi (serving size: 10
gnocchi).

Serving Ideas : Serve immediately.

NOTES : Dill Variation: Add 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill
with flour.
