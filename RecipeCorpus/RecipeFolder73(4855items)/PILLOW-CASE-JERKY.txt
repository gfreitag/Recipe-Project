Title: PILLOW CASE JERKY
Categories: Beef, Smoker
Yield: 1 Batch
1 lg Boneless butt roast
Salt & pepper
Get as large a boneless butt as you can.  Cut the individual muscles
out of the meat and cut off and discard all the fat and connecting
tissue. Cut the meat across the grain as thin as possible.  1/16 to
1/8th of an inch. The thinner the slices, the easier it will be to
dry. Salt and pepper the meat generously on both sides, using more
pepper than salt. Lay out the meat strips on a cake or oven rack
without overlapping them. Set the rack in an insert fireplace
(smoker) and cook on low heat for 8 to 10 hours, turning every 3 to 4
hours, until dried.  You can do the same with a dehydrator or oven,
but it won't turn out as good. After it's done, store in a
pillowcase. Don't STORE it in plastic, as the meat has to be able to
breathe, and a paper sack will leave a paper taste.
