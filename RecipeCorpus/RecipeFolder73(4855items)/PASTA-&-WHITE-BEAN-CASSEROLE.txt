Prepare pasta according to package directions, undercooking by three
minutes; drain.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Crumble turkey into a large skillet and
place over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until turkey is
cooked through, about 4 minutes. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the
drippings in the pan. Add onion, broccoli, sage and tarragon to the
pan. Cook until vegetables are soft, about 4 minutes. Add tomatoes
and heat to boiling, stirring occasionally. Boil 3 minutes. Remove
skillet from heat and add chicken broth or water, beans and salt and
pepper to taste. Stir well.

In a large bowl, combine broccoli and turkey mixture with cooked
pasta. Toss well. Transfer mixture into a 1 1/2-quart baking dish.*
In a small bowl, mix bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese and sprinkle
over casserole. Bake until heated through in the center, about 20
minutes.

*At this point, you may halve the mixture and make two casseroles
using two smaller pans. Bake one for now and freeze the other one for
later.
