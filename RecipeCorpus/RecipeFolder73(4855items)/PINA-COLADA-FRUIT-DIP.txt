Title: PINA COLADA FRUIT DIP
Categories: Appetizers, Fruit, Mc
8 oz crushed pineapple in its own
juice, -- can/undrained
Yield: 1 Servings
:
3 1/2 oz pkg. instant coconut pudding
and pie filli
:
3/4 c  milk
1/2 c  dairy sour cream

In food processor bowl with metal blade or blender container, combine
all ingredients.  Cover; process 30 seconds. Refrigerate for several
hours or overnight to blend flavors. Serve with fresh fruit. Makes 2
1/2 cups. I serve it usually in a pineapple that I've split in half
lengthwise and hollowed out.

Another good dip is simply caramel ice cream topping. Serve with
sliced apples in the Fall is really a nice treat
