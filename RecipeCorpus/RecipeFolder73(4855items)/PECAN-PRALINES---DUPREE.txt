Title: PECAN PRALINES - DUPREE
Categories: Cajun, Candies
Yield: 24 Servings
2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
1/2 c  Water
2 c  Pecan halves
1/4 c  Butter
1 tb Vanilla
Heat the sugar, syrup, water, and pecans in a heavy saucepan until the
sugar is disolved.  Bring the mixture to the boil, stirring
occasionally, until it reaches the soft ball stage (240F). Remove the
saucepan from the heat and add butter and vanilla.
Allow candy to cool.  Whip until the mixture gradually changes to
an opaque color and becomes creamy. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto a
buttered cookie sheet and allow to harden. Makes two dozen. From
Nathalie Dupree's New Southern Cooking Nathalie Dupree writes,
"Pralines are traditionally given as Christmas gifts.  Their
sweetness will linger in your mouth long after the candy is gone."
