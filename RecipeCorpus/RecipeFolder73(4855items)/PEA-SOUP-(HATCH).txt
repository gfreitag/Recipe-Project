Title: PEA SOUP (HATCH)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Split peas {yellow & green}
Rinse well and let soak in a
Bowl of
Salted water with a few
dr Liquid smoke for 3 or 4
Hours
2    Onions, finely chopped
2    Carrots, grated
x  Vegetable stock
x  Balsamic vinegar
1 c  Frozen peas {optional}
x  Liquid smoke.
Saute onions & carrots in a splash of balsamic vinegar. Add about 1/4
cup water and 4 or so spoonfuls of vegetable stock {or 2 or 3 cubes I
suppose}. Turn off heat.

When peas are finished soaking, rinse well, add fresh water to bowl
until the peas are covered. Place in pot with sauted onions &
carrots. Bring to a rolling boil, add a few drops of liquid smoke,
reduce to medium heat and let cook away for an hour or more. Add
frozen peas.

When cooked through I used a potato masher and finished mushing up the
peas.

Goes great with fresh homemade bread!
