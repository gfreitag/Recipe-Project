Categories: Cakes, Pies, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
15 oz Oreo Cookies (Bag)
1/4 lb Margerine or Butter, melted
8 oz Cream Cheese, softened
1 c  Powdered Sugar
12 oz Cool Whip
6 oz Instant Chocolate Pudding
2 1/2 c  Milk
Crush all of the cookies.  (A food processor is good but I prefer the
finger method).

Set 1/4 c of crumbs aside.  Mix the rest of the crumbs with melted
margerine.

Press into the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan.

Blend cream cheese and powdered sugar with a mixer until smooth. Fold
in 1/2 c Cool Whip.  Spread over crust.

Refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Mix pudding and milk together until smooth.

Pour over crust.

Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Spread remainder of Cool Whip on top of pudding.

Sprinkle with reserved cookie crumbs.

Chill about 1 hour and enjoy!
