* skinned, trimmed of fat and cut into serving pieces (backbones
included) Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. In a large Dutch oven, saute
bacon over medium heat until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Add legs, backs
and wings and brown in batches on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes.
(Refrigerate breast pieces, covered, until needed.) Add sauerkraut,
wine, Juniper berries, thyme, cloves and bay leaf to the Dutch oven.
Cook over medium heat until about half the liquid has evaporated,
about 10 to 15 minutes. Place the Dutch oven in the oven, uncovered.
Bake for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally and adding liquid as
needed, until the legs are tender and the sauerkraut is slightly
browned. Remove the Dutch oven from the oven, discard backs, wings
and bay leaf, season to taste, cover and keep warm. Raise the oven
temperature to 425 degrees F. Salt and pepper pheasant breasts and
place them on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast them for 20 to 25
minutes, or until juices run clear when they are pierced with a fork.
Remove the breasts from the roasting pan, set aside and keep warm.
Reheat the legs in the Dutch oven briefly. Slice the meat from the
breasts and lay it over the legs and sauerkraut.
