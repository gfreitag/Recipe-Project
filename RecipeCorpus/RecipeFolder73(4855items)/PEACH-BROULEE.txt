Remove the skin from the peaches. If the peaches are ripe, simply
pull off the skin. Alternatively, skin by cutting a cross in the
bottom of each peach and putting into a large bowl of just boiled
water. Leave for 4 to 5 minutes, then remove from the bowl and pull
off the skin. Cut the peaches in half, then slice and place them in a
deep flame-proof dish. Pour over the orange juice. Mix together the
yoghurts. Cover the peaches with the yogurt and sprinkle with the
sugar. Heat the grill and place the dish under it. When the sugar has
melted and just started to bubble, remove from the grill. Leave to
cool. Place in a fridge and leave for at least one hour. VARIATION.
For a special occasion spoon 45 ml 3 tbsp brandy over the peaches
before covering with the yogurt.
