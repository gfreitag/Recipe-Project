MMMMM-------------------------OMELETTES------------------------------
12    18 eggs; (2 to 3 per person)
Pinch salt
Pinch pepper
1 tb Club soda
6 tb Unsalted butter; (3/4 stick)
* Peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped 1. TO MAKE THE FILLING: In a
medium skillet, heat the butter over medium heat until melted. Add
the shallot and saute` until soft; about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms
and saute` another 2 minutes.  Add the zucchini and continue to
saute` for 2 minutes. 2.
Add the tomato and cook over high heat for 2 minutes to evaporate any
excess liquid from the tomato.  Add the salt, pepper, and basil and
mix well.  Taste for seasoning. Cover to keep warm. 3. TO PREPARE EACH
OMELETTE: Whisk 2 to 3 eggs with ta pinch of salt, a pinch of pepper,
and 1/2 teaspoon club soda until smooth. 4. Melt 1 tablespoon butter
in an 8-inch omelette pan or skillet over medium heat until it begins
to sizzle. 5. Pour in the egg mixture and stir it in the center of
the pan with the flat side of a fork. With the prongs of the fork,
lift the edges on the omelette so any uncooked mixture runs to the
edge of the pan. Vigorously slide the pan back and forth over the
heat until the omelette begins to slip around freely. 6. When the
omelette is lightly cooked but still creamy in the center, spoon
about 2 tablespoons of the filling over the half of the omelette
closer to the pan's handle. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan
cheese over the filling. 7. Quickly jerk the pan toward you with the
handle so that the other half of the omelette flips over on top of
the filling. Slide the folded omelette onto a serving dish. Serve
immediately or keep warm in a low oven while preparing the remaining
omelettes. ADVANCE PREPARATION: The filling may be prepared 1 day in
advance without the basil and refrigerated.  Remove it from the
refrigerator 1/2 hour before using, add the basil and gently reheat.
