Title: OMELETTRY WEST'S GINGERBREAD PANCAKES
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
3    Egg
1/4 c  Sugar, brown
1/2 c  Buttermilk
1/2 c  ;Water or milk
1/4 c  Coffee, brewed
2 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Cloves, ground
1 tb Cinnamon
1 tb Ginger
1 tb Nutmeg
4 tb Butter; melted
Cream together the eggs and the brown sugar, then add the buttermilk,
water and coffee. In a separate container sift together the flour,
salt, baking powder, baking soda, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and
nutmeg. Then combine the liquid and solid ingredients, adding the
melted butter. Cook on a griddle as you would any other pancake. This
recipe may require a fair amount of liquid adjustment. Make sure that
the batter flows off of the spoon fairly evenly, or the pancakes will
be too heavy, and will never cook all the way through without burning
the edges! Serve with butter, maple syrup, honey, or molasses.
