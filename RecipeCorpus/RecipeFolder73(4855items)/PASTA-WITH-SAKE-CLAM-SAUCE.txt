2 cn Chopped clams
3/4 c  Finely chopped onion
2    Garlic cloves,minced/pressed
1 c  Sake or dry vermouth
2 tb Canned capers,drained
10 oz Dried linguine or vermicelli

1. Drain clams and reserve juice. In a 10-12" frying pan, combine 1/2
cup of the clam juice, onion, garlic, and 1/4 cup sake. Stir on high
heat until about 1/4 of the liquid remains. Add remaining sake,
clams, and capers; simmer 3-4 minutes. Keep warm.

2. Meanwhile, bring 4 quarts water to a boil in a 6-8 quart pan on
high heat. Add pasta; cook, uncovered, until tender to bite, about 8
minutes. Drain pasta and pour into a wide bowl; add clam mixture.
Lift and mix with 2 forks until most of the liquid is absorbed, about
1 minute. Top pasta with parsley, cheese, and chilies.
