Title: PERFECTLY PLAIN DEEP DISH BLUEBERRY PIE
Categories: Bakery, Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 8 Servings
9 c  Blueberries
Grated rind of 1 lemon
2 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Flour
2/3 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Quick-cooking tapioca
1 pn Salt
2 ea Refrigerated pie crusts
2 tb Margarine, cubed
Put the rack in the center of the oven; preheat the oven to 450øF. Set
aside a deep 9-inch glass pie plate and baking sheet.

Pour the berries in a large bowl and toss with the lemon rind and
juice. Combine the flour, sugar to taste, tapioca and salt in a small
dish. Add to the berries and toss well. Let stand for 20 minutes.

Ease the bottom pie crust into the pan.  Pile berries in the pan,
mounding them in the center (they will cook down as the pie bakes).
Dot with butter. Center the top crust over the filling, fold in and
crimp the edges. Cut air vents and place the pie on the baking sheet.

Place the pie in the oven and decrease the heat to 400øF. Bake until
the crust is deep brown and the berries are bubbling (about 1 hour).
Remove from the oven and let cool about 2 hours. (Yeah, right ;+}
