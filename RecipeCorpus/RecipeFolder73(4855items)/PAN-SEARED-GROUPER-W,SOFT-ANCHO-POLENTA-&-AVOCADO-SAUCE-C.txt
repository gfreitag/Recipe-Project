SAUCE: Combine the white wine, white wine vinegar, shallots, tarragon
stems, and cracked black pepper in a saucepan. Bring to a boil,
reduce to one-third the volume and strain. Stir the warm reduction
into the egg yolks and whip continuously over a double boiler until
thickened. Slowly add in the clarified butter, whisking constantly.

tarragon, lemon juice, tomato concassé, and avocados. Reserve the 1/2
teaspoon chervil for garnish. Keep the sauce warm until service.

POLENTA: Bring the vegetable stock and orange juice to a boil.
Gradually whisk the cornmeal into the stock. Reduce heat, and simmer,
stirring frequently, until thickened. Add the milk and cook until
cornmeal is creamy. Remove from heat and stir in the Romano cheese.
Season to taste and reserve.

GROUPER: Mix the ginger, garlic, shallots, lemon zest, olive oil,
lemon juice, salt, and pepper together into a paste with a hand
blender. Spread over the fish and marinate for 1 to 2 hours. Heat a
heavy skillet until it smokes. Place the fish, skin side down, in the
pan to brown then turn it over. Let the fish brown, and finish in a
hot oven. Add oil if needed.

SALSA: Mix all ingredients together. Set aside.

SERVICE: Pipe polenta with a pastry bag onto the left side of the
plate in a curved rope-like presentation. Place a spoonful of the
mango and tomato salsa in the center of the plate, top with the
grouper and nap Choron sauce over half the fish. Sprinkle with 1/2
teaspoon reserved chervil.

its first gold medal in the hot food division of the International
Kochkunst Ausstellung, held in Frankfurt, Germany. Chef Friedenreich
says that victory, along with opening his own restaurant in 1979 and
passing his certified master chef exam five years ago, are the
highlights of his culinary career. Chef Friedenreich describes his
demo recipe -- pan-seared grouper with soft ancho polenta and avocado
sauce Choron -- as New World Cuisine. In it, he marries classical,
old world touches, with new world products and techniques. For
example, he prepares a traditional sauce Choron then embellishes it
with diced avocados.
