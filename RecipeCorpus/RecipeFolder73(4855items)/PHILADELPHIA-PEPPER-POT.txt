Categories: Penndutch, Stews
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Honeycomb tripe
2 lb Tripe, plain
1 ea Veal knuckle
1 ea Pot herbs, bunch
4 ea Med Potato
1 ea Onion, large
1 ea Bay leaf
1 x  Salt
1 x  Cayenne
1 c  Beef suet
2 c  Flour
1 x  Water
1 x  Salt
1 x  Parsley, chopped
Cook the tripe the day before using. Wash thoroughly, place in kettle
and cover with water. Boil 8 hours. Remove the tripe. When cooled,
cut into pieces about 1/2 inch square. The next day wash the veal
knuckle, cover with 3 quarts of cold water and simmer about 3 hours,
removing scum as it rises. Remove meat from bones and cut into small
pieces. Strain the broth and return to kettle. Add the bay leaf and
onion and simmer about 1 hour. Then add the potatoes, which have been
cut in squares, and the pot herbs. Add the meat and tripe and season
with salt and cayenne pepper (if desired). Make dumplings by
combining the finely chopped suet, flour, salt and enough water to
permit rolling the dough into dumplings, about the size of marbles.
Flour well to prevent sticking and drop into the hot soup. Cook 10
minutes, add some chopped parsley and serve at once. Source:
