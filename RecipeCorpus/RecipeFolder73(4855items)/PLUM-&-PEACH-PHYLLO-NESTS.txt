This pretty dessert is also easy to achieve with ready-made frozen
phyllo dough sheets and fresh fruit. For a finishing touch, sprinkle
tops with NutraSweet Spoonful.

CUT PHYLLO into 8-inch squares (24). Spray 4 phyllo squares lightly
with vegetable spray; layer squares, turning each slight- ly so that
corners are staggered. Carefully fit phyllo into 8- ounce custard
cup, shaping edges to form "nest" Repeat with remaining phyllo
squares.

ARRANGE FRUIT in bottom of each "nest" Place custard cups on cookie
sheet and bake at 375 degrees until phyllo is golden and fruit
tender, about 15 minutes.

COOL ON WIRE RACKS; carefully remove "nests" from custard cups. Serve
warm or room temperature with Fruit Sauce.

Fruit Sauce: PUREE BERRIES in blender or food processor. If using
raspberries, strain and discard seeds. Stir NutraSweet Spoonful into
puree. Refrigerate until serving time.

Makes 1 cup.
