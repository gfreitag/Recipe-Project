Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Water
1 1/2 tb Olive oil
1/3 ts Salt
2/3 ts Sugar
1 1/4 ts Oregano
1/3 ts Garlic powder
1/3 ts Basil
1 c  Whole wheat flour

Place all ingredients except pepperoni in bread machine in order
suggested by manufacturer and process on raisin bread cyle if that
option is available. At the beep add the pepperoni. If your machine
does not have a raisin bread cycle, add pepperoni about 18 to 25
minutes (depending on your machine's kneading cycle) into first
kneading cycle--you need to allow 4 or 5 minutes of kneading for it
to assimilate the pepperoni into the dough properly.
