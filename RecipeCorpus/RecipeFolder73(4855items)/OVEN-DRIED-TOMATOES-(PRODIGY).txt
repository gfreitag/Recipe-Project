Title: OVEN-DRIED TOMATOES (PRODIGY)
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
Olive oil
Salt and pepper
Tomatoes, preferably plum
Fresh herbs (optional):
-Thyme, rosemary, oregano,
-=OR=- garlic
PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Lightly oil a cookie sheet or baking pan with
olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Slice tomatoes (plum
tomatoes work best) crosswise into 1-inch slices. Pack tightly
together on the pan; ideally the tomatoes should fill the entire pan.
Drizzle the tomatoes lightly with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and
pepper, and sprinkle with fresh herbs if desired (use thyme,
rosemary, oregano or garlic, alone or in combination). Roast for 45
minutes to a hour. The tomatoes should be shrivelled and dehydrated
without burning. The flavor will get more intense and rich the longer
the tomatoes are left in the oven.
