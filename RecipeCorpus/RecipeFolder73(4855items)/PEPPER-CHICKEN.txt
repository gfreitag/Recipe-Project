Title: PEPPER CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 pk Chicken breasts or thighs,
- boneless (approx 1lb.)
1 tb Butter or margarine
1 cn Cream of mushroom soup
1/4 c  Milk
1 c  Sliced mushrooms (opt.)
1 tb Teryaki sauce
1    Salt, pepper & chili
- powder
Melt the butter in an 8" skillet or fry pan, add chicken, salt,
pepper and some chili powder. When chicken is browned on both sides
remove it to a plate. Put the cream of mushroom soup in the skillet,
add teriyaki sauce and milk mixing until soup is smooth. Add more
salt, pepper and chili powder to taste. Add mushrooms if desired,
fresh or canned. Put cooked chicken pieces back into skillet until
thoroughly warmed and covered in sauce. You may need little more milk
if you have a lot of chicken. There is normally enough sauce to cover
the chicken and some for the rice, noodles or mashed potatoes served
with it. The sauce should have a mellow taste not to cover up the
chicken but normally has a spicy, warm aftershock. Preparation Time:
Less than 25 minutes. ~--
