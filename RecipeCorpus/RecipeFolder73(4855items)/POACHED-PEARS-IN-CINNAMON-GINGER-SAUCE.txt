6    Bosc or Anjou pears *
2    Lemons, cut in half
6 c  Water
1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
2    Whole cinnamon sticks
8    Quarter-sized slices fresh
-ginger **
1 tb Minced candied ginger ***
*slightly underripe, peeled, halved and cored ** smashed with flat
sided knife or cleaver *** available at Asian markets, gourmet stores
and some supermarkets

Rub pear halves with cut lemon to prevent browning and set aside.
Combine water, sugar, cinnamon and ginger in large non aluminum pan.
Heat until boiling. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 30 for minutes.

Add pears and heat until liquid almost boils. Reduce heat until
liquid is just under a boil and poach pears until just tender, 12 to
15 minutes. (Knife will pierce center easily.) Remove pears with
slotted spoon and let cool slightly. Arrange cooked pears on serving
dish or in individual serving bowls.

Remove ginger and cinnamon from poaching liquid and reheat liquid
until boiling. Cook until liquid is reduced to thick syrup, about 25
minutes. Let cool slightly. Pour warm syrup over pears. Sprinkle with
candied ginger and serve. You may also serve with scoops of vanilla
or ginger ice cream.
