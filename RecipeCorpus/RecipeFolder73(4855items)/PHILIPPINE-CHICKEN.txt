Title: PHILIPPINE CHICKEN
Categories: Crockpot

6    Chicken Breasts --  skinned
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Vinegar
1/4 c  Soy sauce
2    Garlic cloves -- chopped
Put in crockpot. Cook for 6 to 8 hrs on LOW. Serve over rice. The
original recipe used 1 chicken, cut up.
Gaye's Notes: I used frozen, boneless chicken breasts straight
fromthe freezer and reduced the water to 3/4 cup. This is the best
"new" recipe I have tried in ages. Posted by Gaye Levy.
