Title: PASTITSIO
Categories: Casseroles, Greek
Yield: 24 Servings
Karen Mintzias
1 1/2 lb Ziti thick, uncut macaroni
Salt
2 c  Grated cheeses*
6 tb Melted butter
7    Eggs
6 c  Saltsa Kima
6 c  Medium Saltsa Aspri
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
1 c  Bread crumbs
*Note: Grated cheeses can be any combination of mizithra, kefalotyri
(hard ricotta) or Romano cheeses. In a large pot, boil the ziti in
salted water until almost tender. Drain thoroughly. In a large bowl,
combine the macaroni, 1 1/2 cups of the grated cheeses, the butter,
and 4 of the eggs, lightly beaten.
Butter an 11" x 15" x 3" baking pan, and in it layer half the
macaroni mixture.  Separate 2 of the eggs and combine the 2 egg
whites plus 1 more whole egg with the Saltsa Kima. Spread it evenly
over the macaroni in the pan and cover with the remaining macaroni.
Meanwhile, combine the Saltsa Aspri with the 2 egg yolks and the
spices. Pour over the macaroni, spreading it into the corners with a
spatula. Sprinkle the top lightly with the remaining cheese and the
bread crumbs. Bake in a 350 degree for 45 minutes or until a golden
crust develops and the sauce bubbles. Remove from the oven and allow
to stand for 15 minutes before cutting into squares. Serve on a warm
platter. Note: Try this once using 1 1/2 pounds of ziti for an
elegant pastitsio. A very rich recipe; you can safely reduce the meat
sauce and Saltsa Aspri by one cup, if desired. From: "The Food of
Greece" by Vilma Liacouras Chantiles.
