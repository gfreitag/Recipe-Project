These cookies are very quick and easy to make. They are shaped by
pushing the batter from a spoon, like many American cookies, but then
are flattened by tapping the baking sheet vigorously several times on
the work surface so that they will be crisp.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Lightly butter two (2) baking sheets.

Beat butter until soft and smooth. Add sugar and beat until smooth.
Add 1 egg and beat until blended. Beat second egg in a small bowl,
then gradually beat it into mixture. Stir in lemon zest. Sift flour
over mixture and stir it in with a wooden spoon. Let batter stand 15
minutes at room temperature.

To shape cookies, take 1/2 teaspoon of batter and use another
teaspoon to push batter onto baking sheet. Space cookies about
3-inches apart. TAP baking sheet vigorously several times on work
surface to flatten cookies.

Bake 6-7 minutes, or until edges of cookies are brown and centers
light beige. Transer to a rack to cool. (If cookies harden and become
difficult to remove, return them to oven for 30 seconds to soften.)
Cool baking sheets and bake remaining cookies.

Cookies can be kept about 1 week in an airtight container; or they
can be frozen.
