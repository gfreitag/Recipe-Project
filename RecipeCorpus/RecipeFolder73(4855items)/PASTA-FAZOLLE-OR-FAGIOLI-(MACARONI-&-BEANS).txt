Use your favorite red or white bean recipe.  Be sure to keep it
soupy, not thick.   (Winn Dixie and Carollo's carry them.) Cook beans
until done. Cook macaroni in boiling water for about 20 minutes or
until done. Drain and rinse with hot water.  In same pot you cooked
macaroni it, put back pasta, add enough bean and broth to make soupy.
Serve with buttered Italian or French bread.  You can make this dish
meatless and you can also make it red by adding a can of tomato
sauce. Recipe feeds 4.
