[1] Micro-cook the spaghetti squash or use left-over. [2] Cook pastas
together. [3] Saute: While the pasta is cooking, brown the sausage.
Add olive oil and onions, carrots, and fennel stalk (or 1/4 cup
chopped celery).  Add chicken broth as needed to soften the
vegetables. Add garlic, mushrooms, and Italian herbs. Continue
cooking and stirring until mushrooms are warmed (not limp). Remove
from heat but keep warm. [4] Assemble: Drain the pasta but do not
rinse.  Put pasta back in the pot. Add squash and stir to mix.  Add
the saute mixture to the pasta pot and stir. Beat one egg (or use 1/4
cup egg substitute). Turn on the heat. Make a well in the center and
. . . [5] Working quickly, over moderately high heat, pour the egg
into the well and stir, constantly, to coat, bind, and cook the egg.
Season with basil, oregano, more pepper, salt to taste, cilantro and
parsely. Serve with grated parmesan.

COOKsNOTE: Freeze the sausage, then chop it.  Warm leftover squash
when draining the pasta (do not put cooked squash in boiling water
again). Keep this dish warm in 300 deg oven (not stove top). Last
served 23 Ap 96 with sweet-bitter salad (Bob liked).  Next time try
... Broccoli Rabb; ground turkey with fennel seed.
