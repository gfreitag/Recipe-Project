Title: PIZZA ON THE GRILL - PIZZA DOUGH <R T>
Categories: Main dish, Eat-lf mail, Low fat
1 pk Active Baker's Yeast
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Warm Water -- 105 - 115 Deg
pn Salt
:
2 1/4 ts Kosher Salt
1/4 c  White Cornmeal --
Fine-Ground
:
3 TB Whole-Wheat Flour
1 TB Olive Oil
2 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour -- To 3
1/2    C,
Unbleached
:

Dissolve yeast in the warm water with sugar.

After 5 minutes, stir in salt, cornmeal, whole-wheat flour, and oil.

Gradually add all-purpose flour, stirring with a wooden spoon until a
stiff dough has formed.

Place the dough on a floured board, and knead for several minutes,
adding only enough additional flour to keep dough from sticking.

When dough is smooth, transfer to a greased bowl.  To prevent,
transfer to a greased bowl. To prevent a skin from forming, brush top
of dough with additional olive oil, cover bowl with plastic wrap, and
let rise in warm place, away from drafts, until doubled, 1 1/2 to
2    hrs.

Punch down dough.  Knead dough several times on lightly floured board.
Return dough to bowl; cover and let rise 40 min.

Punch down dough.  If sticky, knead in a bit more flour.

Makes enough for four 12 inch pizzas.

Well, as usual...I don't follow directions.  I didn't do them on the
grill but in my oven.  I cooked them at 475 deg F for 15 min. The
dough was probably the lightest and best that I have **ever** eaten.
I topped one with tomatoes, sweet anise, 1 T slivered almonds
crushed, and sauteed zucchini.  Topped another with the Mushrooms
with Mint and Lemon recipe I posted earlier in the week. I gave half
of the dough to Sally (my friend) and she cooked them for dinner with
her toppings.
