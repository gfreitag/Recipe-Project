Title: ONE EGG OMELET
Categories: Eggs
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ts Butter,margarine or bacon
Fat
1 lg Egg,at room temperature
Pinch of salt
2 ts Cold water
Salt and black pepper
Place a 10" non stick skillet containing the bacon fat over medium
heat until the fat is sizzling hot,but not browned.
Meanwhile,separate the egg.Place the white on a sturdy dinner plate
and the yolk in a small bowl.Beat the egg white with a pinch of salt
on the plate,using a flat wire whisk,until soft peaks form. Add cold
water to the egg yolk in the bowl.Beat it vigorously with a fork.Pour
the beaten egg yolk over the beaten egg whites on the plate and fold
the two together,using the whisk.Pour the egg mixture into the heated
skillet containing the sizzling fat. Cook the egg in one piece over
medium heat,tilting the pan or lifting the edges of the egg to allow
the uncooked egg to spread over the pan. Do not over cook and turn
the heat down,if the skillet is holding too much heat.Turn the egg
once with a spatula.Season to taste with salt and black pepper.The
omelet cooks very quickly, in a minute or so.Serve at once to one
person. To make an egg sandwich,place the one egg omelet between two
slices of homemade bread with or without butter,toasted or not
toasted. For a luncheon sandwich,add a leaf of lettuce,along with a
bit of chopped green onion,a few chopped raw or lightly sauteed
mushrooms,sprinkling of lemon pepper and some alfalfa sprouts. Makes
a perfect meatless sandwich.
