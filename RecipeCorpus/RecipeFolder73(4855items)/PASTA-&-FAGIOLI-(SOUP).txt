8 oz Navy beans or

Water ; for soaking beans
3 tb Olive oil

1/2 ts Dried oregano
1/4 ts Dried basil

4 tb Italian parsley; chopped
8 oz Small pasta shells or
Other small shaped pasta

-imported Parmesan cheese
-you can afford, it's worth
-the cost
Soak beans overnight in water to cover.  Next day drain water and
rinse beans.

In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat and add the onion,
celery, and garlic.  Cook and stir gently for 3 minutes or until the
vegetables are soft and begin to color slightly. Add tomatoes,
oregano, basil, stock, parsley, and soaked beans.  I usually add 1
cup of cold water at this point to the bean mixture. Bring to a boil,
reduce heat, and simmer about 1-1/2 hours or until beans are soft.
About 30 minutes before soup is done, in a large pot of boiling
water, cook pasta until al dente. Drain and rinse. Add to the soup
mixture. Add freshly ground pepper and salt if you so desire. I do
not cook with salt at all so the soup goes without it. Guests that
wish a saltier soup can add it at the table. Serve soup with freshly
grated Parmesan cheese.

This soup is one of our favorites on a cold wintery night, I usually
serve with a mixed green salad, crusty sourdough bread, a simple
fruit cup or baked apple for dessert, and of course a good Italian
Chianti or Barbera Wine.  Serves approximately 6 people.
