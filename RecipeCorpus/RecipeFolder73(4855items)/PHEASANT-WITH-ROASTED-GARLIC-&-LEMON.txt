Title: PHEASANT WITH ROASTED GARLIC & LEMON
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 2 Servings
1    Pheasant
- cut into serving quarters
1/4 c  Olive oil
12    Garlic cloves; unpeeled
2 c  Chicken stock
-OR low-sodium chicken broth
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
1/2 ts Salt; or as desired
1    Lemon; yellow zest only
1/3 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Water
1/4 c  Whipping cream
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Heat the oil in a 12-inch oven-proof skillet
over high heat on top of stove, add the garlic and saute until the
skins are a medium golden color. Add pheasant and brown on both
sides. If the garlic turns black, remove it from the skillet. When
the pheasant is brown, replace the garlic. Without pouring off the
fat, add broth and juice. Sprinkle with salt, bring to a boil and
place, uncovered, in the oven for
50    minutes, turning once.

TO MAKE CANDIED ZESTS: CUT THE LEMON ZEST into 1/4-inch strips and
place in a small saucepan. Add sugar and water, bring to a boil over
medium heat. Simmer gently until the water is nearly evaporated and
zests look shiny and translucent. Strain zests, discard any extra
syrup and set zests aside. Transfer the skillet with the chicken to
the stove top, add the cream and place over high heat. Reduce the
liquid until it has a shiny consistency. Arrange the pheasant pieces
on a serving platter, scrape the garlic cloves and glaze over it and
garnish with candied zests. Serve immediately.
