;Water, to make thick batter
Mix flour and water to make a thick batter.  Let stand uncovered for
four or five days, or until it begins working. This basic recipe
requires a carefully scalded container.

NOTE:

All containers for starters not using yeast must be carefully scalded
before use.  If you are careless or do not scald them the starter will
fail.
