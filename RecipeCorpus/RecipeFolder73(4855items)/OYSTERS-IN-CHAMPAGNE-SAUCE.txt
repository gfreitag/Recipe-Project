24    Raw oysters - in shell
MMMMM----------------------CHAMPAGNE SAUCE---------------------------
1 1/2 tb Unsalted butter
1 1/2 tb Flour
1/2 c  Oyster juice - from above
1/2 c  Champagne - or other dry
-sparkling wine
1/4 ts Celery seed - ground
Freshly ground white pepper
2 c  Rock salt - or coarse salt
-for the broiler pan
* 2 cups rock salt - or coarse salt for the broiler pan

*DIRECTIONS*

PREPARATION: Open the oysters as instructed in previous recipe
("Opening Oysters in the Microwave"). Measure 1/2 cup of the strained
cooking liquid and reserve.

CHAMPAGNE SAUCE: Melt the butter in a 1-quart glass or ceramic
measure or bowl, uncovered, on high for 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup
reserved oyster juices and Champagne and cook, uncovered, on high,
stirring twice during cooking, for 4 minutes or until thickened.
Recipe can be made to this point a few hours ahead.

COOKING AND SERVING: Heat the broiler with rack set at its highest
level. Stir celery seed and white pepper to taste into the sauce.
Spread 2 cups of coarse or rock salt in the bottom of a broiler pan
to steady oysters. Nestle reserved shells into salt.  Put each oyster
in a shell and thoroughly coat the tops with sauce. Put under
preheated broiler until just golden, about 2 minutes.

Makes 4 first-course servings.

NOTE:  This is a simple and elegant classic.  You can prepare the
oysters and sauce ahead in the microwave, and then broil for a minute
or two just before serving. The obvious wine to serve is Champagne.
If you choose another dry sparkling wine to drink instead, use the
same one in the sauce.
