Title: PISTACHIO BISCOTTI
Categories: Cookies, Christmas
Yield: 32 Servings
2    Eggs
1 ts Almond extract
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Sugar
1 3/4 c  Cake flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
2/3 c  Shelled pistachio nuts
3 oz Semisweet chocolate, melted
Heat oven to 350'F. In a medium bowl, beat eggs with an electric
mixer on high speed until fluffy. Gradually beat in almond extract,
vanilla and sugar until mixture is thick and lemon-colored, scraping
down sides of bowl frequently with a rubber spatula.

Mix cake flour with baking powder and salt. With a wire whisk, fold
into egg mixture until just thoroughly combined. Fold in pistachios.

Grease a 10x14" strip down center of two cookie sheets. Spoon half of
pistachio mixture down center of each cookie sheet to make a 3x10"
log. Bake 30 minutes. Remove from oven; leave oven on.

Let logs cool on sheets 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle.
With a serrated knife, cut each log diagonally into 16 slices. Place
slices, flat sides down, on cookie sheet and return to oven. Bake 5
minutes. Turn slices over and bake 5-7 minutes, or until golden on
both sides. Remove to racks and let stand until cool enough to
handle. Spread melted chocolate over one end of biscotti and let cool
completely. Store in a tightly covered container. Makes 32 cookies.
