Categories: Poultry, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Mostaccioli or Rigatoni
-OR other medium pasta
-shape, uncooked
8 oz Turkey sausage
-(Italian-style)
1 tb Olive or vegetable oil
1    Garlic clove; minced
2 c  Canned plum tomatoes
- crushed
12 md Black olives
-- pitted and sliced
1 pn Crushed red pepper
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
2 tb Chopped Italian parsley
Grated Parmesan cheese
--(optional)
Crumble the sausage into a lightly oiled skillet. Place over medium
heat and saute, stirring often to break up the meat, until the
sausage is cooked through. Drain and cool the meat.

Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and
fry until golden brown. Add the tomatoes, olives and crushed red
pepper. Return the sausage to the skillet and add salt and pepper to
taste. Reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce is thickened, about
5 minutes.

Prepare pasta according to package directions. Before draining,
reserve one cup of the pasta cooking liquid. Drain the pasta and
return it to the pot over low heat. Add the sauce. If the sauce is
too thick to evenly coat the pasta, add some of the reserved pasta
cooking liquid. Stir in the parsley. Divide the pasta among serving
plates. Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.
