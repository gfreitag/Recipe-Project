Title: PEPERONATA
Categories: Italian
Yield: 6 Servings
3 tb Olive Oil
1    Clove Garlic
5    Sweet peppers, red, green,
And yellow
3 md Onions
2 c  Plum tomatoes
1 ts Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1/3 c  Dry white wine
Put the olive oil in a large pot (with a cover) over medium heat. Cut
the garlic in half, add it to the oil, saute it to a golden brown,
and then discard it. Cut the peppers open and discard their cores and
stems, and slice them into long thin strips.  Cut the onions into
quarters and cut off the bit of core at the bottom of each quarter.
Add the peppers and onions to the flavored olive oil and cook
briskly, stirring constantly. As soon as they start to wilt, add the
tomatoes, salt and a few grinds of pepper. Stir well, and when the
mixture is back to a boil, reduce the heat and cover the pot.  Simmer
for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then raise the heat, add
the wine, stir and boil uncovered 5 minutes, or until the sauce has
condensed a bit and the vegetables have cooked. Serve hot or cold.
