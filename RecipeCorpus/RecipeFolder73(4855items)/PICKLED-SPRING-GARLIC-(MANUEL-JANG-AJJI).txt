Title: PICKLED SPRING GARLIC (MANUEL JANG-AJJI)
Categories: Asian, Korean
Yield: 2 Lg serving
30    Whole Head/young garlic
2 c  Vinegar
2 c  Soy Sauce
2/3 c  Sugar
1. Select young garlic heads with no sprouts. Remove roots and stems,
wash, and peel off the outside skin. Place in bowl or jar and pour in
the vinegar. Allow to stand for 4 or 5 days,, turning the heads
occasionally. 2. When the garlic has lost its harsh taste, drain off
the vinegar. 3. Boil the soy sauce with the sugar for a few minutes,
and let cool. Pour the cooled soy sauce over the garlic, seal the jar
and let it sit for at least 2 months. 4. To serve, slice across the
heads. Notes: 1. Pickled garlic can be made only in early spring when
soft, young heads are available. 2. It is very important to let the
boiled soy sauce cool before combining with the garlic. Cooling
prevents the garlic from going bad. 3. Garlic prepared this way loses
all of its characteristic strong odor.
