Categories: Pets
Yield: 3 Dozen
2 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
6 tb Margarine
1    Egg
1/2 c  Skim milk
1/4 c  Creamy peanut butter
2 ts ;water, very cold (approx.)
2    Egg whites; lightly beaten
Sesame seeds; optional
1. Combine flour, sugar and salt. With a pastry blender or a fork,
cut in the margarine until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs.

2. Beat egg in a small bowl. Stir in milk and peanut butter (mixture
will be lumpy). Add egg mixture to flour mixture; stir. Stir in the
water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the dough forms a ball.

3. On a lightly floured surface, knead dough for 3 minutes. Roll
dough out to a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle. Cut into desired shapes with
a cookie cutter. Brush with beaten egg whites and, if desired,
sprinkle with sesame seeds.

4. Bake in a preheated 350'F oven until firm and golden, about 30
minutes (reduce baking time if you rolled biscuits thinly).

NOTE: These biscuits are best if they are air-dried for 3 or 4 days
before being stored in a plastic bag or container.
