Did my first cooking out of my new Indonesian cookbook last night. I
fixed a stir fried carrot dish to back up a pork/soy stew (originally
posted by Jen Kuiper) and plain white rice. Both are very easy to fix
and quite good. Here's the particulars.

These are carrots, cut into matchsticks and cooked in a little oil or
butter. The word wortel doesn't sound Indonesian and isn't. It is
borrowed from the Dutch name for the carrot, since it was the Dutch
who introduced this vegetable to Indonesia.

Peel, wash, and cut the carrots into small sticks. Slice the shallots
and chilli.  Crush the garlic.  In a wok, heat 2 tablespoons of
vegetable oil or clarified butter. Saute the slice shallots and
chilli for 1 minute, then add the garlic and the carrots. Stir
continuously for a minute or so and then put in the stock, or soya
sauce and water. Cover and continue to cook for 4 minutes.  Uncover,
taste, and add salt if necessary. Cook for a further 2 minutes,
stirring all the time. Serve hot.

Makes 2 servings.
