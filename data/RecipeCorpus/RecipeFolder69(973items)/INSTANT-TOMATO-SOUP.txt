Recipe by: Gwynne Bodle This is my wife's recipe for tomato soup. I
had some just last week and it is almost a year old. A friend who
tried it suggested adding dry onion or onion powder which we will
with this years batch. BTW, we dry our own tomatoes. If you use store
bought tomatoes than you may have to make some adjustments.

Combine all ingredients and seal in small plastic bags using a vacuum
sealer, such as Decosonic Pak-n-Save.

To use: Open package and place in a bowl or mug. Add 8 ounces boiling
water stirring constantly.

Note: If you dry your own tomatoes, dry until just brittle. Powder in
a blender. Dried tomato can also be found in health food stores. If
using dried tomato slices powder in blender.
