Recipe by: LASZLO REPAS (MBSB94A) * ( cook 5 heads of cleaned and
crushed garlic in 2 cups of water). There are many variation to the
Hungarian Sausage, different regions have their own recipes and
tastes. The following is the one I make, you can make some changes to
suit your taste. The onions and hot peppers are optional. I use them,
but many people do not.

Grind meat with onions into a large pan, Add seasonings and garlic
water, MIX well (check for salt to taste) Stuff into sausage casings,
tie both ends of casing. Use it fresh, it should last in the
refrigerator for about one week. We freeze some of it in serving size
portions, in large plastic zip lock bags. We also smoke part of it.

We cook the fresh kolbasz in a covered casserole pan, cover it with
water cook until all water is gone, uncover and fry to brown on both
sides. I am sure you will find other methods to cook and enjoy
Hungarian kolbasz.JM.
