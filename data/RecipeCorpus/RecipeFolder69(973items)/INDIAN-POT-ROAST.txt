butter. Lay meat on bed of this sliced onion in lge. Dutch oven. Add
the butter, spices and seasonings.  Pour rum or wine over meat.  A
good pot roast will supply most of its own juices, but pour the water
over to make an ample supply of gravy. Cover tightly and simmer 3-4
hrs, either in oven or on the stove top.  If carrots are wanted, add
during last 1/2 hr. of cooking. Add dumplings last 12 minutes. When
roast is done, remove to a hot round platter and surround with
dumplings and carrots.  Stir gravy until smooth. Pour over roast.  If
fresh dill is available, cut it over dish with lavish hand. Courtesy
