Title: HUNGARIAN-STYLE PORK CHOPS & POTATOES
Categories: Main dish, Pork, Hungarian
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Pork chops, thin, 1-1/2 lb.
1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
1/8 ts Fresh ground pepper,to taste
2 tb Butter or margarine
1/2 c  Onion, chopped
1 1/2 c  Chicken broth or water
1 tb Paprika, or to taste
4    Med. potatoes, cut in sixths
1/4 c  Sour cream, or to taste
Sprinkle both sides of chops lightly with salt and pepper. Heat large
heavy skillet; add chops and brown quickly on both sides. Remove and
set aside. Add butter to drippings and saute onion untile tender,
stirring occasional- ly. Stir in 1 c. broth, the paprika and 1/4 t.
salt. Add potatoes. Bring to boil, cover and cook over moderate heat
about 10 minutes, shaking pan occa- sionally. Add chops. Cook 10 to
15 minutes longer or until potatoes and chops are tender, turning
occasionally and adding remaining 1/2 c. broth if too dry. Remove
potatoes and chops to heated platter. Stir sour cream into pan
juices. Heat through but do not boil. Pour over potatoes and chops.
Season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, sprinkle with
minced parsley.

NOTE: David says it took longer that the times listed for the
potatoes to get done.  I don't remember how much longer and he's
still asleep, but you can use your judgement. (He tends to like his
potatoes mushy, so the times listed may be all right for your family.)
