Yield: 6 Servings

1/2 c  Milk
3 oz Bittersweet chocolate;
-finely chopped
3/4 c  Heavy cream
3 lg Egg yolks
1/3 c  Sugar
Boiling water
1. Cut 3 slits in a piece of waxed paper, and use it to line a
baking pan large enough to hold 6- 1/2 cup ramekins, custard cups or
petits pots.
2. In medium saucepan, scald the milk over high heat. Stir in the
chocolate. Remove from the heat and add the cream; stir to blend. Set
aside to cool.
3. In med-size bowl, gently combine yolks and sugar. Do not let the
mixture foam. Slowly pour the chocolate mix into the yolk mix,
stirring constantly. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve. Let rest,
uncovered, at room temperature, for 1 hour.
4. 325 F oven. Spoon off any foam that may have risen to the surface
of the chocolate. Divide evenly among the ramekins. Pour enough
boiling water in pan to reach about halfway up the sides. Cover the
pan loosely with foil, to prevent a skin from forming. Place in the
center of oven and bake until are just set at the edges but still
trembling in the center, 30 to 35 minutes.
5. Remove from oven and carefully remove the ramekins from the water.
Refrigerate, loosely covered, for at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours.
Serve the pots de creme well chilled, without unmolding.
