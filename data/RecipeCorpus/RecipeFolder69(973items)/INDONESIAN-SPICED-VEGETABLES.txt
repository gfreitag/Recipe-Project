A stir-fry of summer vegetables is cooked with ginger and spices and
coconut milk, making a dish evocative of Indonesian cuisine. Serve it
with rice or noodles.

In the blender, grind the spices, herbs, almonds and onion into a
paste. Fry the ground paste in the oil for 3-4 minutes, stirring
well, then stir in half of the coconut milk. Add the vegetables and
stir over a gentle heat for 10 minutes. Then add the rest of the
coconut milk and simmer for a further 8-10 minutes. Check the
seasoning and serve hot, garnished with chopped hard-boiled egg.
