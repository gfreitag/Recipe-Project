Title: HUMMUS RECIPE (KATZENS)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
2    To 3 medium cloves garlic,
Sliced [I use more, but I
Love garlic!]
1    Large handful parsley
2    Healthy scallions, in 1-inch
Pieces
3 c  Cooked chick-peas
6 tb Tahini  [First I cut down to
One, now I just use a few
dr Chinese
Sesame oil]
6 tb Fresh lemon juice [I use
Quite a lot more - one or
Two whole lemons,
Squeezed]
3/4    To 1 tsp. salt (to taste)
1    Cayenne and a little cumin,
To taste [she says optional,
But I don't!]
1) Place garlic, parsley and scallions in a food processor or
blender, and mince.

2) Add chick peas, tahini [or oil], lemon juice, and salt, and puree
to a thick paste. [I grind the chick peas separately first, it makes
life much easier].

3) Season to taste with cayenne and cumin. Transfer to a tightly
lidded container and chill.

The green colour can be a bit disconcerting at first, and it does
taste a bit different, using sesame oil instead of tahini. But it is
still good, I feel.
