To prepare the anasazi beans, soak overnight in water to cover. The
next day, drain the beans and place them in a saucepan with fresh
water to cover.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and let the beans
simmer until the skins break, about 3 hours.  It may be necessary to
add water as the beans cook to prevent them from burning and
sticking. After the beans are cooked, remove from the heat and set
aside. You should have about 3 cups cooked beans. While the beans are
cooking, roast, seed, and devein the chiles and the pepper. Leave
chiles whole; slice pepper lengthwise into six strips. To start
building the tacos, place 1/2 cup cooked beans on each piece of
frybread.  Add 1/4 cup greens per taco, followed by a red tomato
slice. Add 4 slices avocado and 1 slice red onion, separated into
rings. Follow with radishes and 4 golden yellow plum tomatoes per
taco, and top with 1 roasted green chile and 2 slices roasted red
pepper or chile. You can vary the toppings and the order in which the
taco is built.
