Title: HUMMIS BI TAHINI
Categories: Pulses and, Salads, Sauces and, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Sesame Seed Paste --
(tahini)
1/3 c  Water
1/4 c  Olive Oil
6 tb Lemon Juice
4    Cloves Garlic -- peeled
2 cn Garbanzo Beans -- well
Drained
1/2 ts Ground Cumin
1 ts Coriander Seeds
Salt -- to taste
Combine first five ingredients in food processor and blend until
smooth. Add chickpeas and seasonings and blend to puree. Taste and
adjust flavors to suit (I usually like a little more lemon.).

The mixture you get before adding the chickpeas is also delicious,
although extremely strong in garlic
:>).  Use a bit less garlic, thin with water and you've got a
delicious salad dressing.  Unfortunately, a very high fat salad
dressing, though.
