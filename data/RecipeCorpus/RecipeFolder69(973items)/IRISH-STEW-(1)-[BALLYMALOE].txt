Title: IRISH STEW (1) [BALLYMALOE]
Categories: Irish, Lamb
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Lamb neck chops
4    Med-sized onions
1    Lamb fat or beef dripping
1    Salt and pepper
1 tb Chopped parsley

Directions: Shred some of the lamb fat and render it down in a heavy
casserole.  Peel onions and potatoes, scrape carrots. Cut the meat
into 8 pieces;  only the excess fat is cut away. Bones need not be
removed. Cut the carrots and onions in quarters. Toss meat in fat
until color changes, and repeat with onions and carrots. Add stock
and season carefully. Put whole potatoes on top. Simmer gently until
the meat is cooked, 2 hours approx. Pour off the cooking liquid.
Degrease, and reheat in another saucepan. Check seasoning. Then swirl
in butter, chives, parsley, and pour back over stew.
