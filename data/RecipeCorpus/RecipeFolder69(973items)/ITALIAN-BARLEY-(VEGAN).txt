Categories: Grains, Low-fat, Prodigy, Dec.
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Chopped onions
1/2 c  Chopped sweet green peppers
1    Garlic clove; minced
1 cn Tomatoes; undrained/in chunk
16 oz. can
1/2 ts Dried oregano
1/2 ts Dried basil
2 c  Water
5 1/4 oz Barley; 3/4 cup
A tasty side dish for almost any entree, this filling grain also
reheats nicely in the microwave. In a medium saucepan over medium
heat cook onions, green pepper, and garlic until lightly browned. Add
small amounts of water if necessary to prevent drying. Add tomatoes
spices and water. Bring to a boil. Stir in barley, reduce heat to
low, cover and simmer 50 minutes until barley is tender and water is
absorbed. Stir occasionally while cooking and add more water if
necessary. Note: the original recipe called to saute the 1st three
ingredients in olive oil(1T+1t) but I chose to eliminate it and
eliminate almost 5 gms fat per serving.
