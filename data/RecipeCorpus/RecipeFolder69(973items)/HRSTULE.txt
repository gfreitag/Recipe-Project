Title: HRSTULE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Batch
6    Eggs
1/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Butter
1 1/2 l  Cooking oil
1 ts Lemon peel bits
1 tb Rum
1 ts Vanilla
2 lb Flour; blended with...
3 ts Baking powder
Separate eggs; beat whites until they "peak".  To slightly beaten
eggs, add sugar and cooled, melted butter; blend until smooth. Add
the egg whites, lemon peel, rum and vanilla and blend. Add enough
flour (about 2 pounds) to make a dough that will roll nicely. Roll
out the dough to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into 5/8 x 6 inch strips.

Over quite hot fire, heat the oil until it stops hissing or
"speaking". Use a pan to give you an oil depth of about 2 to 2-1/2
inches. This will allow your hrstule to submerge when you drop it in,
and whenit rises to the surface, it pretty well indicates readiness
to turn. Turn and cook both sides a golden brown color. Coat with
powdered sugar while hot. Twist in various shapes or knot your
hrstule before droppoing into oil.
