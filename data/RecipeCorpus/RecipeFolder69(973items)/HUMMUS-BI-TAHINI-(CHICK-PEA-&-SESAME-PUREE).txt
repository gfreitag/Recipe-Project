Categories: Spreads, Sauces
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Chick peas
3 c  Water
1/3 c  Tahini
1/2 c  Lemon juice
2    Cloves garlic; crushed
Salt
MMMMM------------------------FOR SERVING-----------------------------
Parsley; chopped
1 tb Olive oil
Paprika or cayenne pepper
1. Wash chick peas well, cover with the water and soak for 12 hours or
overnight. 2. Boil gently for 2 hours in the water in which they were
soaked, add 1 teaspoon salt and cook until very tender, about 3 hours
in all. Drain and reserve some of the cooking liquid and 1 tablespoon
of the peas. 3. Press peas through a sieve or food mill, adding about
2 tablespoons of the cooking liquid to separate the last of the peas
from the skins. 4. Slowly blend the tahini and most of the lemon
juice into the puree. 5. Crush garlic with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a
mortar and add to puree. Adjust flavour and consistency with lemon
juice or cooking liquid and add salt if necessary. Hummus should be
thick and smooth. 6. Spread in a shallow serving dish, swirling it
with back of a spoon. Pour olive oil in centre and garnish with
reserved chick peas, chopped parsley and a sprinkling of paprika or
cayenne pepper. Makes 3 cups. Cooking time: 3 hours Blender or food
processor method: Puree peas to separate skins, add to container or
processor bowl with remaining ingredients, holding back some lemon
juice and salt to adjust flavour. Blend or process until thick and
smooth. Note: Even if using a modern appliance the chick peas must be
separated from their skins for a successful hummus.

Preparation time can be shortened by removing the skins either after
the initial soaking, or after boiling.
