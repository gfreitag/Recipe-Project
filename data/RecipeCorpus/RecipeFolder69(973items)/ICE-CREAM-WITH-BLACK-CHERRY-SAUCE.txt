Categories: Italian, Fruits, Ice cream, Sauces
Yield: 8 Servings
10 oz Morello cherries; pitted
- or other if these not
- available (maybe Bing)
- reserve the stones
3/4 c  Sugar
1/2    Lemon
1    Vanilla bean
4    Eggs; yolks only
2 c  Milk
- Gelato alle Amarene - Tie the cherry stones in a piece of
cheesecloth. Put the cherries in a saucepan and add half the sugar,
the cherry stones, the zest and juice of the lemon, vanilla bean and
sufficient water to barely cover the cherries. Simmer for 30 minutes.
Set aside to cool. Discard the cherry stones. Push the sauce through
a sieve into a bowl. In the top of a double boiler, beat the egg
yolks with the remaining sugar until the mixture falls from the
beater in a ribbon. Add the milk. Place over simmering water and
cook, without boiling, until the custard thickens enough to coat a
spoon. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Freeze the mixture
in an ice-cream machine and churn until set. Transfer the ice-cream
to a shallow serving bowl. Pour the morello cherry sauce over it and
serve.
