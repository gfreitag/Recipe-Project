Title: HTIPITI TIROSALATA (WHIPPED CHEESE SALAD)
Categories: Appetizers, Greek
Yield: 1 Servings
Tsouskes
Oil for frying peppers
1 lb Feta cheese
3 tb Oil
Tsouskes are hot spicy peppers.  Of course the best is green long
peppers which grow only in Macedonia are extremely hot and very tasty.

You fry them in oil, you peel their skin and you chop them into very
small pieces. How many it depends on how hot they are and how spicy
you can eat. After, you cut about 1 pound of feta in to small pieces
and you mix it with the peppers. Add about 3 table spoons of olive
oil. Work all the ingredients with the fork until it becomes a paste.
Be carefull: I said with fork. Not with food processor, not with
goudhi. Just FORK. :)

You are all set. Enjoy with bread or crackers as appetizer.
