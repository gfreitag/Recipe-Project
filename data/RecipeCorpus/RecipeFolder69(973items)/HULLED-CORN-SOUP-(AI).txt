Title: HULLED CORN SOUP (AI)
Categories: Soups, Vegetables, Side dish, Pork
Yield: 1 Servings
4 qt Dried Indian corn kernels
3 lb Salt pork
1 lb Dry red kidney beans
1 qt Hardwood ashes
Put enough water in an old kettle to cover the corn, Bring to a boil;
add corn and ashes. Cook about 20 minutes, stirring frequently. This
loosens the hulls or shells on the corn. When the hulls slip off the
kernels by working between the fingers, drain the water and rinse
corn in cold water, working corn with the fingers to help remove
hulls. Drain and parboil; drain, rinse and parboil again. Repeat
several times until the parboiled water looks clean and clear, (A
handmade basket is traditionally used for this purpose.)

When corn is good and clean, place it in a large kettle or canner with
clean water. Parboil washed beans separately until water is colored;
add both water and beans to the corn mixture. Cut salt pork into
small pieces; add to the corn and beans. Be sure to use plenty of
water because the corn will swell as it cooks. Cook 3 or 4 hours, or
until corn is tender, stirring occasionally and adding water as
needed. Makes 16 quarts of soup.
