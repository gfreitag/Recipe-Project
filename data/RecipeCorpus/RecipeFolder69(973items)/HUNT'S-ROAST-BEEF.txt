Title: HUNT'S ROAST BEEF
Categories: Pot roast, Roast, Beef
Yield: 8 Servings
4 lb Beef roast(boneless)
1 ts Beau Bonde seasoning (or sal
1/2 ts Lemon Pepper
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 cn Tomato sauce (15-oz)
2 ea Medium onions, sliced
1 1/2 c  Sliced celery
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Sugar
4 ea Carrots, quartered
2 ea Medium potatoes, quartered
1 x  (scrubbed and unpeeled)
1 c  Dry wine
Sprinkle roast with salt and pepper (or Beau Monde). In dutch oven,
brown roast in hot oil; drain. Add remaining ingredients, except
carrots and potatoes. Simmer, covered, 1 1/2 hours. Add vegetables,
cover, and simmer 1 hour longer. When I feel lazy, I simply spray the
crockpot with non-stick cooking spray (ie., Pam), omit the oil, add
the roast, and then mix the remainder of the ingredients with a
little wine, pour it over the roast, and let it cook on LOW for about
6 hours. Tasty and easy! It's from the Hunt's Cookbook (modified)
