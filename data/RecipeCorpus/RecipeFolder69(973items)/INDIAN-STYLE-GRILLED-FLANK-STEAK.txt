Title: INDIAN-STYLE GRILLED FLANK STEAK
Categories: Beef, East/orient
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 tb Garam masala
[seperate recipe]
1 1/2 ts Coarse salt
1 ts Black pepper
1 1/2 lb Flank steak
In a small bowl stir together the garam masala, the salt, and the
pepper, in a shallow dish rub the mixture onto both sides of the
steak, and let the steak stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Grill the steak on an oiled rack set about 5 to 6 inches over glowing
coals for 8 to 10 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat.
(Alternatively, the steak may be broiled under a preheated broiler
about 3 inches from the heat for 8 to 10 minutes on each side.)
Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let it stand for 10
minutes. Holding a knife at a 45 degree angle, cut the steak across
the grain into thin slices. Serves 4 to 6.
