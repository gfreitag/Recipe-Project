Title: INDIAN PUDDING (ROBERTA KRIEGER)
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1 qt Milk
2/3 c  Cornmeal
3/4 c  Molasses
1/4 c  Butter [I've tried
-margarine, but it doesn't
-taste the same]
3 tb Sugar
1 ts Ginger
1 ts Salt
Supposedly, this is an authentic recipe from Daniel Boone's wife
Rebecca.

Ice cream [I prefer vanilla]

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Bring milk to a boil in the top part of
a double boiler. Stir in cornmeal and cook over hot water for 15
minutes. Stir in molasses [I use the light variety, but I guess dark
would work as well], and cook for 5 minutes longer. Remove from heat.
Stir in butter, sugar, ginger, and salt. Turn into an oven casserole
and bake 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Serve warm with ice cream.

Daniel and Rebecca served this warm with fresh-churned butter.
