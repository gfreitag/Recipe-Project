Title: IRISH POT-ROASTED CHICKEN
Categories: Irish, Main dish, Poultry, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
1 x  Chicken, about 4.5 lb
4 oz Oatmeal
1 x  Medium onion, chopped
2 tb Butter
3 tb Stock
1 x  Salt and pepper
6 oz Bacon
3 x  Med. onions, sliced
2 lb Potatoes
1 x  Seasoned flour
3 tb Dripping or oil
4 x  Med. carrots, sliced
If there are giblets with the bird, take them out, wash all but the
liver (reserve that for another use), and cover with water, add salt
and pepper, bring to the boil and simmer for half an hour. Wipe the
bird inside and out and remove any lumps of fat from the inside;
sprinkle with salt. Mix together the oatmeal, chopped onion, butter
or suet, stock, and seasoning, stuff the bird with this mixture and
secure well. Heat the dripping or oil and lightly fry the bacon, then
chop and put into a casserole. Quickly brown the bird in the same fat
and put on top of the bacon. Soften the onion and briefly saute the
carrots, then add to the casserole. . Strain the giblet stock and
make it up to about 1/2 liter. Heat and pour over the chicken.  Cover
and cook in a moderate oven (350C) for about an hour. . Meanwhile,
cut the potatoes into thick slices and blanch them in boiling water,
or steam them for about 5 minutes. Toss them in seasoned flour and
add them to the casserole, adding a little more of the giblet stock
if needed.  Cover with buttered wax paper and continue cooking for
another 1/2 hour, taking off the paper for the last few minutes for
browning.
