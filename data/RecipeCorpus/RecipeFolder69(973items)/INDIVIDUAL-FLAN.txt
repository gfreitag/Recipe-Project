*DIRECTIONS*

Place 1 cup sugar in a heavy saucepan; place over medium heat. Cook,
stirring constantly, until sugar melts and syrup is a light golden
brown. Remove from heat; add water, stirring well. Pour hot caramel
mixture into 12 custard cups; set aside.

Beat eggs until frothy. Add 1-1/2 cups sugar, vanilla, and salt; beat
well. Gradually stir about 1 cup milk into egg misture; add to
remaining milk, stirring constantly. Pour mixture into custard cups.
Place cups in two 13"x9"x2" baking dishes.  Pour 1" of hot water into
larger dishes. Bake at 350 for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a knife
tests clean. Remove the cups from the water, and cool. Refrigerate
until chilled.

To serve, loosen edges of custard with a spatula; quickly invert onto
dessert plates. --- Southern Living magazine
