Title: HOW CANNING PRESERVES FOODS
Categories: Canning, Information, Preserves
Yield: 1 Guide  The high percentage of water in most fresh foods makes them very
perishable. They spoil or lose their quality for several reasons:

* growth of undesirable microorganisms- bacteria, molds, and yeasts, *
activity of food enzymes, * reactions with oxygen, * moisture loss.

Microorganisms live and multiply quickly on the surfaces of fresh
food and on the inside of bruised, insect-damaged, and diseased food.
Oxygen and enzymes are present throughout fresh food tissues. Proper
canning practices include:

* carefully selecting and washing fresh food, * peeling some fresh
foods, * hot packing many foods, * adding acids (lemon juice or
vinegar) to some foods, * using acceptable jars and self-sealing
lids, * processing jars in a boiling-water or pressure canner for the
correct period of time.

Collectively, these practices remove oxygen; destroy enzymes; prevent
the growth of undesirable bacteria, yeasts, and molds; and help form
a high vacuum in jars. Good vacuums form tight seals which keep
liquid in and air and microorganisms out.
