Recipe by: Joel Ehrlich <Joel.Ehrlich@SALATA.COM> Cut the beef, pork

soy sauce, ginger, garlic, pepper, water and sugar in a small bowl.

skewers with foil. Broil 3" from the heat for 3 minutes. Turn. Broil
until done to taste (roughly 2 minutes longer). Remove chicken and
beef satays. Cook pork satays until well done. Arrange on a board or
platter. Garnish with the green onions. Serve
