Yield: 16 Servings
1/2 c  Butter (1 stick)
1 c  Sugar
1 cn Choc Syrup--1 lb
4    Eggs

1 c  Nuts, chopped opt.
ICING RECEIPE ALSO
Cream together butter and sugar till fluffy. Beat in syrup, then
eggs one at a time. Beat in flour gradually. Fold in nuts (optional).
Pour into greased cake pan (I use abt 9x13 pan). They do not rise
much. Bake at 350 degrees about 30-40 mins. *Orig. receipe calls for
jelly roll pan-- that is 15x10. Cooking time is 25 mins for this
size. Pan will be full but they do not rise.
Frost with the Frosting for Iowa Brownies receipe to follow. **I use
Hersheys Choc. syrup.
This is more of a "cake" than a brownie. And is "missing something"
without the icing!
