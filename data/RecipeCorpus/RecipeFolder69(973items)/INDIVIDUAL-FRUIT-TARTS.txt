PREHEAT OVEN TO 425F. Roll out the pastry and cut circles about
5-inches across using a cookie or biscuit cutter. Gather into a ball
the dough remaining from the cutouts, roll again and cut additional
circles. Sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons of sugar, stack with waxed
paper between and refrigerate, or better, freeze.

Prepare the fruit by peeling, coring, slicing thinly and tossing with
lemon juice. Warm the jam using 1 tablespoon or 2 of water if needed.
Taking a disk of dough, turn the edges up as though making a small
pizza. Spread a little apricot jam over the pastry. Put a few slices
of overlapping fruit on, paint with more apricot jam, sprinkle with a
tablespoon of sugar and dot with butter. Bake for 15 minutes. The
pastry edges should be golden brown.
