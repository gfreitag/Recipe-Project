Title: ISOBE ZUKURI (SASHIMI WRAPPED IN NORI)
Categories: Japan, Fish
Yield: 8 Servings
6    Nori (dried laver)
- sheet
1 lb Sashimi (fresh fish fillet)
1/2 c  Chirizu
1. Cut the fish into slices 1/2" thick and 6 to 7 inches long or as
long as the sheet of nori.

2. To intensify its flavor and color, pass the nori, a sheet at a
time - and on one side only - over a gas flame or candle. Lay the
nori flat on a hard surface - the Japanese use a bamboo mat to
facilitate the rolling - with the wide side of the mat facing toward
you.

3. Place a long slice of fish along the length of the nori and roll
the nori into a long, thick, tight cylinder. With a sharp knife cut it
crosswise into 1-1/2" slices. Roll and cut the remaining fish and
nori in similiar fashion. Serve with chirizu, as part of a Japanese
meal or first course.
