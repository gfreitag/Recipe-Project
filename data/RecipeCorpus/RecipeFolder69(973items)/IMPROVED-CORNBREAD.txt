Title: IMPROVED CORNBREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
2    Eggs
2 tb Baking Powder
1 ts Baking Soda
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Honey
2 tb Vegetable oil (lard or
-crisco would have been
-better)
1 c  Buttermilk
1 c  White flour
1 c  Cornmeal
Mix well while preheating greased pans or skillet at 400 for a few
minutes. Pour in batter and bake at 400 for 20-25 minutes. Could be
baked in cornbread pan or muffin tins also. I don't really use
buttermilk by the way. It would go bad in the fridge because I bake
so seldom. I use four tsp of dried buttermilk and one cup of water.
The real thing would be better I presume. Medium bread pans filled
half way will make two loafs.

Skillet method would be heat oil or lard while heating the pan, then
add to the batter before pouring into the skillet. Enjoy It!

I found that some recipes called for one egg, some all cornmeal flour
(which produces corn frisbees), some sugar instead of honey, and milk
instead of buttermilk. Confused? I was. This is my creation and I'm
not sure the salt is necessary. It will increase about 70% when
baked. Origin. Pete Porro 14 June, 1992
