Title: IMPOSSIBLE HAMBURGER PIZZA
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Vegetables, Pies
Yield: 8 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
2 1/2 c  Bisquick Baking Mix
1    Active Dry Yeast; Package
2/3 c  Water; Hot
MMMMM------------------------MEAT MIXTURE-----------------------------
1 lb Lean Ground Beef
1/2 c  Onion; Chopped, 1 Md
15 oz Tomato Sauce; 1 Cn
2 ts Oregano Leaves
1/4 ts Pepper
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1/2 c  Green Pepper; Chopped, Opt.
2 c  Mozzarella Cheese; Shredded
1 c  Parmesan Cheese; Grated
Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.  Mix the baking mix and yeast and
stir in the hot water.  Turn the dough onto a well-floured surface
and knead until smooth, about 20 times. Let the dough rest a few
minutes.

While the dough is resting, cook and stir the meat and onion in a
large skillet until the onion is tender and the meat is brown. Drain
off the excess fat.

Stir in the tomato sauce, oregano leaves, and pepper and set aside.
Divide the dough in half.  Roll each half on an ungreased baking
sheet into a rectangle, 13 X 10-inches or on a pizza pan 12-inches in
diameter. Pinch the edges to make a slight rim.  Spread the meat
mixture almost to the edges.  Top with the green pepper and cheeses.
Bake until the crust is brown and the filling is hot and bubbly, 15
to 20 minutes. Cut into squares or wedges and serve.

NOTE: If desired, you can use shredded Cheddar Cheese for the
Mozzarella in the above recipe.
