Title: INDONESION SOY SAUCE
Categories: Indonesian, Condiment
Yield: 6 Servings
2    Bottles Regular Soy Sauce *
3    Bottles Water
4 md Onions, chopped
6    Bay Leaves
2 ts Laos **
1/2    Bag Demerara Sugar
*I use 17 oz. bottles of China Lily (a Canadian Brand) **Laos is also
called Galingal and can be found at Asian food/spice stores.

METHOD:

Put all ingredients in a large pot and cook on medium till onions are
limp. Add sugar and bring to a boil to disolve sugar. Strain and pour
into bottles. I keep it in the fridge but I don't know if you have to.

It's a very sweet Soy Sauce that may take a little getting used to
but you will probably find that you can use it for things and not
worry about a "salty" taste.
