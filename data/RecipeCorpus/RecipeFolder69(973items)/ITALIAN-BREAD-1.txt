Recipe by: rec.food.cooking You didn't mention the size of your
breadmaker, so I'm going to figure it's the 1lb loaf (I have a
panasonic). Anyway, I've used this recipe at least a dozen times and
I've never had a failure. I USE ONLY PILSBURY BREAD FLOUR . . . and
it has nothing to do with the fact my father and brother work for the
company. Here goes:

Ialways put water in first and then add the dry ingredients with the
yeast on top.  I use the NORMAL setting (3.5 hours) on mine.
