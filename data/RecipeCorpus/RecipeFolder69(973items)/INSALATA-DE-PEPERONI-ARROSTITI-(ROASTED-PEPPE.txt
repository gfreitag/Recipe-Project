1 ts Red wine vinegar
1 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 md Red onion, minced
3 tb Chopped parsley
3 tb Capers--rinsed, dried &
Finely chopped
1/2 ts Salt
6 md Green bell peppers
(about 2-1/2 lbs.)

1/2 c  Thawed frozen peas
1 lb Fresh mozzarella cheese,

1.  In a medium bowl, combine the mayonnaise, anchovy paste and
vinegar. Slowly pour in the olive oil in a steady stream, stirring
constantly. Stir in the onion, parsley, capers and salt. (The sauce
can be prepared up to 4 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.) 2.
Preheat the broiler. On a baking sheet, broil the peppers, 6 at a
time, as close to the heat as possible, turning occasionally, until
charred all over, about 25 minutes per batch. Immediately transfer
the peppers to brown paper bags, seal and set aside to steam for
about 20 minutes. Peel and core the peppers, then cut them in half
and remove the seeds and ribs. Slice lengthwise into 1-1/2-inch
strips. 3. If using fresh peas, blanch them in boiling salted water
for 5 minutes.  Drain, refresh under cold running water, drain again
and set aside.  Arrange alternating red and green pepper strips
around the edge of a large serving platter. Layer alternate slices of
cheese and tomato down the center and sprinkle the peas on top.
Drizzle the dressing over the salad and serve.  (The salad can be
completely assembled 3 to 4 hours ahead before serving and kept
covered at room temperature.)
