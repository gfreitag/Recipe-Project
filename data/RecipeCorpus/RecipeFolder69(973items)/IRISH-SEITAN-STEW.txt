Title: IRISH SEITAN STEW
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Seitan -- diced
1 c  Carrots -- roll-cut
1 c  Parsnips -- roll-cut
1 c  Onion -- diced
1 c  Potatoes -- peeled and
Diced
2    Bay leaves
1/2 ts Rosemary -- whole
1/2 ts Garlic -- minced
1/2 ts Basil
1 tb Parsley -- fresh, chopped
2 c  Water
5 ts Tamari soy sauce
1/2 c  Celery -- flaked
4 tb Water -- cold
4 tb Cornstarch
Put seitan, veggies (except celery), and herbs and spices in a large
pot (Dutch oven or small stock pot will do). Sautee in a little water
or veggie broth at medium heat for about 8 minutes, stirring to
prevent burning. Add water and tamari and bring to a simmer. Cook
about 10 more minutes or until veggies are soft.

Add celery (add at end to help retain color and texture).

Mix the 4 T cold water with the cornstarch.  Turn off heat under stew.
Vigorously stir in cornstarch solution. Turn heat back on under stew
and stir until thickened.
