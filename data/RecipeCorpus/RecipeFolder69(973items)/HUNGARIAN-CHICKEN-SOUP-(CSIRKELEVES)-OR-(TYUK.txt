Winter is the time for Chicken Soup. Wind and snow whipping around the
yard. Windows get all steamed. Write your name on the mist. Smells
that you will recognize in later years with a tug on your heart.
There is no soup as good as the soup Mama made when you were young.

Regards, June Meyer. Cook chicken in pot with water, skiming the scum
off when starting soup to boil. Place all the vegetables and spices
in the pot. Cook under a low flame until the chicken is tender.
Remove as much fat as possible. Strain soup and serve with broad
noodles or LIVER DUMPLINGS. Eat chicken on the side with TOMATO SAUCE
or DILL SAUCE.

LIVER DUMPLINGS Mix all the ingredients together. A cusinart is great
for this. Drop into boiling water by the 1/2 teaspoonsful. Cook about
15 minutes or until done. If batter is too thick you can add a little
water. Drain and serve with soup. Serves a family.
