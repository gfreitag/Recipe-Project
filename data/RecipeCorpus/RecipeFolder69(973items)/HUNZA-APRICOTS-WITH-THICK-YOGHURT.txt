Title: HUNZA APRICOTS WITH THICK YOGHURT
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
250 g  Hunza Apricots
225 g  Thick plain yogurt, Greek or
Home made
Hunza apricots are apricots which are dried without preservatives.
They are therefore brown in colour instead of orange. They have a
wonderful flavour and a natural sweetness.

Put apricots into a medium sized saucepan and cover generously with
water. Leave to soak overnight if possible. Then simmer the fruit
over a gentle heat, without lid on the saucepan until fruit is tender
and the has reduced to a syrup.

Serve hot or cold, with the yogurt.
