To make onion relish, in a bowl combine onion, spices, seasonings and
lemon juice, then squeeze them with your fingers. Let sit for an
hour. Just before serving mix through coriander to taste. In a
saucepan of lightly salted water, boil potatoes, in their skins,
until just cooked. Allow to cool, then cut them in half. Slice
zucchini on the bias into 5mm thick slices. Heat a little ghee in a
heavy bottomed saucepan, and saute onion, ginger, garlic and chilli
until soft. Add spices and fry for 30 seconds. Add all the
vegetables, toss well and add coconut cream bit by bit as they cook.
To make raita, put yoghurt in fine sieve and leave to strain for 15
mins. Grate cucumber with skin on. Chop mint leaves. Peel, seed and
dice tomatoes.  Combine vegetables with yoghurt and seasonings.
Chill. Chop coriander leaves.  When vegetables are cooked and a thick
sauce has formed, add coriander and lemon juice to taste.
