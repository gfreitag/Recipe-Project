Title: IRISH CREAM OF MUSSEL SOUP
Categories: Irish, Fish, Soups
Yield: 8 Servings
32 md Mussels
1    Onion; peeled/chopped
1    Celery; chopped
1    Leek (white part only); chop
1 c  White wine
3 c  Fish stock
2 c  Heavy cream
4    Chervil or substitute parsle
Salt and pepper to taste
Note: When buying mussels look for small ones that have tightly closed
shells - a sign that they are alive and thus fresher.
Place mussels, wine and fish stock in a stock pot. Add chopped
vegetables. Cover and shake to stir contents. Cook on high heat 4 to
5 minutes. After 5 minutes shake pot again, remove lid and strain
contents into a collander, catching liquid in a bowl. Then strain
soup liquid again through a wire mesh strainer into a saucepan. Over
high heat, boil and reduce soup for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, remove the mussel meat from most of the shells, leaving
some mussel shells intact for serving as a side dish with the chopped
vegetables.
Pour the heavy cream into reduced soup. Whisk while maintaining the
high heat. Add mussel meat slowly. Whisk gently. Then continue to
stir with a soup ladle until it boils.
Ladle soup into soup bowls. Add sprigs of chervil to top of soup for
garnish.
Serve the remaining mussels on the side with an array of the cooked
chopped vegetables.
