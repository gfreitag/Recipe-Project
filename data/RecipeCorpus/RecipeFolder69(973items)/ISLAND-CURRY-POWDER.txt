To make your own curry powder, you will need a small spice grinder,
clean coffee grinder or mortar and pestle. heat a medium frying pan
over medium-low heat and add the mustard seeds, cumin, peppercorns,
anise, fenugreek and coriander. Shaking the pan, dry roast the spices
until the mustard seeds turn gray and the spices become fragrant,
about 5 minutes. Let cool, then grind to a fine powder. Transfer to a
small bowl and stir in the turmeric and cinnamon. Store tightly
sealed in a dark place. It will keep for up to 6 months (or longer)
and can be used like any other curry powder.

Note: This is what's known as a sweet curry powder. It is especially
versatile because it has very little heat of its own. Use it as is or
spice it up by adding cayenne or other hot pepper to taste.
