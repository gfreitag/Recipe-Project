Title: HOW TO CLEAN ARTICHOKES-ROMAN JEWISH STYLE
Categories: Vegetables, Italian
Yield: 1 Servings
-cold water
2    Lemons
Artichokes
Have a large bowl at hand, containing cold water and the juice of
two lemon with the four halves of the rind. Keep the artichokes in
another bowl of cold water while you are working on them. Take one
artichoke at a time, drain it, and pull off and discard the smallest
outer leaves. Holding the artichoke with its bottom toward the little
finger of your hand, tilt the top away from you, and holding a small
sharp knife tightly with your right hand, insert its tip, one leaf
deep, into the tender, lighter part of the leaves. Keeping your right
hand steady, slowly rotate the artichoke with your left hand so the
bottom moves in a clockwise direction, and cut upward in a spiral.
The tough part of each leaf will fall off, while the tender edible
part remains attached. Peel the green layer off the bottom and stem,
and then drop the trimmed artichoke into the lemon juice until you
are ready to cook. This operation requires some practice; you will
know if you have mastered this technique when the artichoke thus
cleaned looks more or less like the one you started with, only
smaller and whiter.
If you are not ready to use the artichokes immediately after you
have cleaned them, try to keep them completely submerged in lemon
water. This is not easy. Artichokes are very buoyant and float to the
surface making it difficult to keep them covered. An inverted plate,
just a bit smaller in diameter than the bowl, place over the
artichokes, will keep them below the surface. Another way is to crowd
them inside a glass jar and cover them with the lemon water. If you
plan to leave them at this stage for more than a hour or so, you must
refrigerate them, but it is not advisable to keep artichokes this way
for more than a few hours. Lemon is used to prevent discoloration; on
the other hand, the lemon will cause the artichokes to spoil very
quickly."
