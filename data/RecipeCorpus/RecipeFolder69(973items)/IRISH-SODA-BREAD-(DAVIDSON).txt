Title: IRISH SODA BREAD (DAVIDSON)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Loaf
2 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 c  Butter, sweet
1 c  Raisins
1 tb Caraway seeds
1 lg Egg
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
1/4 c  Sour cream
Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Butter a 9" round cake pan. Sift together
the dry ingredients.  Using a food processor with the steel blade or
a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it
resembles small peas.  Blend in the raisins and caraway seeds. Beat
the egg, buttermilk, and sour cream together until blended.

Stir the egg mixture into the dry mixture until just blended.
Transfer the batter to the pan and bake for about 50 to 55 minutes,
until a tooth- pick tests clean.
