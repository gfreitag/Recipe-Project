Another satay recipe, but easier to make. But you do need a blender, a
double boiler (or reasonable facsimile) and the driv- ing desire to
cook the perfect meal for your loved-ones, to be honest, and to
report all taxes.

1. Cut chicken into small cubes.

2. Saute chicken in oil until cooked. Remove from heat.

3. In a blender, put garlic etc. to water ingredients and set on
"destroy." Blend until smooth.

4. Put mixture in double boiler, cover and cook till somewhat
thickened (at least 20 minutes).

5. Slice remaining onion into rings; saute in remaining oil until
translucent.

6. Make rice.

7. Mix chicken and sauce.

8. Serve over rice; place onion rings on top.

This dish should be spicey. If not, add more peppers the next time.
