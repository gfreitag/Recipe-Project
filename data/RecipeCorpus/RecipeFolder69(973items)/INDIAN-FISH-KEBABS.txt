This is a very colorful and tasty arrangement of marinated and then
skewered and grilled vegetables and fish. The marinade, called
chermoulla, is a blend of fragrant seasonings, oil, and lemon juice.
In this version I've suggested my favorite vegetables for kebabs. You
should choose your own favorites; some other good choices are
eggplants, mushrooms, and onions. special equipment: skewers (if you
are using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for 1/2 hr. and fill
them out to the ends so the skewers won't burn)

Combine the ingredients for the chermoulla.  Cut the fish into 1-inch
cubes.  Similarily, cut the vegetables into 1-inch cubes. Place the
fish and vegetables in the chermoulla and marinate, refrigerated, for
2 hours.
When you are ready to assemble the kebab, soften the bay leaves in
boiling water for several minutes. Alternate the tomatoes, peppers,
yellow squash, and fish on skewers. Place a bay leaf occasionally on
the skewers next to the fish.  Reserve the chermoulla.
Cover the broiler pan with foil and plkace the kebabs on it about
an inch apart.  Broil for 15 to 20 minutes, basting with the reserved
chermoulla, and turning frequently to cook evenly.
Serve on rice or in pita bread and garnish with lemon wedges and
sprigs of mint. From Sundays at Moosewood Restaurant
