Mention calfs liver and a lot of people make strange faces. Serve
Hungarian style calfs liver that was dipped in pakrika, and sauted in
butter along with thinly sliced onions and then smothered in vinegar
to make a most unusual but succulent dish. Serve with mashed potatos
or cooked rice and you have heaven on earth.

Regards, June Meyer.

Depending on how much liver you are making, slice liver into finger
sized strips. Season liver with very liberal sprinkling of paprika.
Season with salt and pepper. Dredge strips in flour. Let rest while
you thinly slice onions. Melt butter in frying pan and saute onions.
When onions are almost cooked, toss in the liver strips and saute
along with the onions. The liver will only take a few minutes to
cook. When they are done, sprinkle about 1/2 tsp. paprika over the
onions and mix in a good Tbls. vinegar to make a thick onion gravy.
Serve when ready.
