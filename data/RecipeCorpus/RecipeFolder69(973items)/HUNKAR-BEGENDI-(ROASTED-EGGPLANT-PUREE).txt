First, roast the eggplants in the following fashion: Prick each one
in 3 or 4 places with the tines of a long handled fork. Then impale
them, one at a time, on the tines of the fork and turn them over a
gas flame until the skin chars and begins to crack.  (If you have an
electric stove, pierce the eggplants, place them on a large baking
sheet and broil them 4 inches from the heat sseri; freshly
;grated or use Romano cheese
:
1/2 ts Salt
Black pepper; freshly grated
:

First, roasm, cutting away any badly charred spots on the surface.
Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise and chop them finely. Then mash
the pulp to a smooth puree with the back of a spoon or with a mortar
and pestle.
In a heavy 3 to 4 quart saucepan, heat the tablespoon of butter over
moderate heat.  When the foam begins to subside, stir in the flour
and when it is completely absorbed pour in the milk all at once.
Stirring vigorously with a whisk, cook over high heat until the
mixture comes to a boil and thickens heavily. Beat in the pureed
eggplant, reduce the heat to low, and, stirring occasionally, simmer
for 5 minutes. Off the heat add the cheese, salt and a few grindings
of pepper. Beat vigorously until the mixture is thick enough to hold
its shape almost solidly in the spoon.
Taste for seasoning and serve at once.  Hunkar begendi traditionally
accompanies roast or braised veal or lamb.
