This soda bread recipe comes from an Icelandic farmhouse. It's
dark,delicious, and full of wholesome grains. It's also excellent
toasted.

Preheat the oven to 350F.  Grease two 9x5x3 inch loaf pans. In a large
bowl, cream together the brown sugar and butter. Mix the rolled
oats,rye flour, whole wheat flour, all purpose flour, salt, and
baking soda together in another bowl, then add the creamed mixture
along with the buttermilk. Mix until well blended. Divide the mixture
between the two pans and smooth the tops. Bake 1 hour or until a
wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Turn out of
pans and cool on racks. Makes 2 loaves.
