BROWNIES:

In a mixing bowl, cream sugar and butter.  Add eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each addition.  Add syrup and flour; mix well.
Stir in nuts. Pour into a greased 13x9x2" baking pan. Bake at 350
degrees for 30-35 minutes or until top springs back when lightly
touched. Cool slightly. Meanwhile, for icing, combine sugar, butter
and milk in a small saucepan. Cook and stir until mixture comes to a
boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 3 minutes, stirring
constantly. Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla and chocolate chips
until chips are melted (mixture will be thin). Immediately pour over
brownies. Cool completely before cutting.

Note:  If cooking for two, freeze brownies in an airtight container
and thaw as needed.
