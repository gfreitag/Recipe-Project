Wash and trim the brussels sprouts and drop them into a large pot of
boiling salted water. Boil, uncovered, for 10 minutes, then drain and
rinse with cold water. Fry the bacon bits in a 3-quart saucepan until
they render fat. Add the chopped onion and saute' it until it turns
translucent. Pour in 1/4 cup of warm water, scrape up any bits stuck
to the bottom. Season with pepper and 1/4 tsp. of salt, and simmer
for 1 minute. Remove pan from heat. When the sauce is cool enough to
put a finger in, add the sour cream and blend thoroughly. Add the
brussels sprouts and turn carefully to coat every piece. Turn into a
greased 3-quart ovenproof casserole, sprinkle with bread crumbs, and
dot with butter. Bake in a pre-heated 325 oven for 20 minutes or
until golden brown on top.
