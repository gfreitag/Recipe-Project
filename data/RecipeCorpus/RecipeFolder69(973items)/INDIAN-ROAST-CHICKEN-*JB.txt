Categories: Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Plain yogurt
3 md Garlic cloves, minced
2 tb Finely grated fresh ginger
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
2 ts Finely grated lemon zest
2 ts Ground coriander

1/2 ts Turmeric

1    Chicken (3 1/2-lb)
A spicy yogurt marinade lends this bird the distinctive flavor and
texture of classic Indian tandoori chicken. Serve it with saffron
rice, roasted onions and a creamy cucumber raita. Marinating the
chicken in a plastic bag allows the entire bird to be coated with the
yogurt mixture.

1. In a medium bowl, combine the yogurt, garlic, ginger, lemon juice,
lemon zest, coriander, cayenne, turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and
1/4 teaspoon of black pepper; mix well. Place the chicken in a
gallon-size plastic bag, add the marinade and turn to coat all over.
Seal the bag. Refrigerate the chicken for at least 4 or up to 12
hours, turning it occasionally in the bag.

2. Preheat the oven to 350 B0. While the oven heats, let the chicken
come to room temperature. Lift the chicken from the marinade and
transfer to a roasting pan; discard the remaining marinade. Season
the chicken with salt and pepper and roast for 25 minutes. Rotate the
pan and roast for another 25 minutes. Increase the temperature to 400
B0 and roast the chicken for about 35 minutes longer, or until the
juices run clear when a thigh is pierced with a fork.

3. Transfer the chicken to a platter, cover loosely with foil and let
rest for 15 to 20 minutes before carving. Skim the fat from the
juices in the roasting pan and strain the juices through a coarse
strainer; season with salt and pepper and serve with the chicken.
