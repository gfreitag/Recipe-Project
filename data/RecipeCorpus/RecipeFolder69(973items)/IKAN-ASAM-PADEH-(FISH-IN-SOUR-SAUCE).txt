Time: 0:30 Remove all skin from fish fillets, ensure that no bones
remain and cut into serving-size pieces. Chop very finely the
shallots, ginger, garlic and chiles, and pound these together with
the turmeric powder, tamarind and soy sauce (or use a food
processor). Heat the oil in a shallow pan and stir-fry the
spice-paste for four to five minutes, then add the fish, cover with
approximately one cup of cold water and bring to a boil. Lower heat,
season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook
over a very low heat until the fish is done. Serve with fresh
vegetables and rice.
