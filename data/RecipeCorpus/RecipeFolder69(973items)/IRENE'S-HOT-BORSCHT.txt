Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
3 md Beets
2 1/2 qt Water
3 md Potatoes
1 sm Onion
1    Bell Pepper
2    Carrots
6    Cloves garlic
1 sm Can tomato paste

Peel beets, add to water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Cook
until done, about 45 minutes. Add salt. Remove beets from water and
set aside to cool.

Peel potatoes and cut into 1/8s. Add to beet water. Cook until almost
done.

Meanwhile, chop onion and bell pepper. If you would like to spice it
up add a couple of Jalapenos. (They would never do this in Russia.)
Grate carrots. Finely chop garlic. Saute vegetables in oil until
tender. Add tomato paste and just enough water to make a thick sauce.
Add sugar and cook an additional five minutes.

Coarsely grate cooled beets.

Coarsely chop 1/4 of a head of cabbage and add to potatoes and beet
water. Boil until the cabbage is tender, about 15 minutes. Add
vegetables and vinegar. Taste and correct for salt.

Serve in soup bowls with a dollop of sour cream.
