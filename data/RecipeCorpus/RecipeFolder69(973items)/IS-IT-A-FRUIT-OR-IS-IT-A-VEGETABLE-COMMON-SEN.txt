In the name of sportsmanship, let's consider one more way to look at
fruits and vegetables.  "According to L.H. Bailey, a vegetable is in
horticultural usage, an edible herbaceous plant or part thereof that
is commonly used for culinary purposes.  In common usage, the fruits
of the tomato, cucumber, squash, etc., are considered as vegetables,
grown with other vegetables in the home garden, although of course
each one is a seed bearing organ and hence, under strict usage of the
language, might be considered a fruit." It is also as popularaly
understodd, any plant cultivated for its edible parts.  This loose
definition includes roots (beet and carrot), tubers (potato), stems
(celery), leaves (lettuce), flower buds and heads (cauliflower),
fruits (tomato), and seeds (peas, beans, corn).

Looking back to the list, we can easily slip into familiar habits:
artichoke, asparagus, avocado, bean, beet, broccoli, brussels sprouts,
cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celery, corn, cucumber, eggplant,
lettuce, onion, parsnip, pea, pepper, potato, radish, squash, and
tomato are vegetables, all the others are fruits.

In other words, if you call it a vegetable, and your neighbour calls
it a vegetable, and your local grocer calls it a vegetable, then it
must be a vegetable. You like the sound of this? Fine with us. And,
deep in our hearts, we suspect that's the best way to play, according
to Hoyle.
