Stephen Ceideburg
1 c  Diced carrots
1/4 c  Shredded and diced @cabbage
1/2 c  Diced Japanese eggplant
2 c  Peeled and diced cucumber
1 c  Diced onions
1/4 c  Diced garlic
1 c  Diced red or green bell
-pepper
1 c  Diced celery
1 c  Mixed fresh herbs, minced *
2 tb Salt
4    To 6 cups red wine vinegar
* parsley, mint, tarragon, basil, chives

My friend Giti Hormozyari served me this refreshing mixture with a
slice of bread and a glass of iced tea on a hot, July day. I was
exhausted, ready to faint from the heat and this revived me
completely. Traditionally, it is served with meats but it is
wonderful straight out of jar with bread. The large quantity of mixed
herbs sets it apart from a usual relish.

Mix the vegetables, herbs and salt together, cover with the vinegar.

Refrigerate at least 25 days before using. If you omit eggplant, the
relish will ready in 3 or 4 days.

Makes 6 to 7 cups.
