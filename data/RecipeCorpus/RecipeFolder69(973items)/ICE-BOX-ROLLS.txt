Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
1    Cake dry yeast
OR 1  cake compressed
-yeast
1    Egg, well beaten
2 ts Salt
6 tb Sugar
2 c  Lukewarm water
3 tb Melted shortening
6 1/2 c  Flour
Soften yeast in lukewarm water.  If dry yeast is used combine the
sugar, yeast, and water and allow to stand in a warm place 1 1/2
hours. If compressed yeast is used allow to stand in lukewarm water 5
minutes. Add salt, egg, sugar, if sugar has not already been added,
and shortening. Mix well.  Add flour, a little at a time, beating
thoroughly after each addition until dough is stiff enough to knead.
Knead on lightly floured board until the dough is smooth and elastic.
Cover dough with a warm, damp cloth.  Set in a moderately warm place
and allow to stand 2 hours. Work down, cover closely with waxed
paper, and place in the refrigerator overnight.  If baking rolls for
luncheon or dinner, remove desired portion of dough from the
refrigerator and allow about 2 hours to warm to room temperature and
become light. Form into rolls. Cover and let rise until treble in
bulk. Place on well-oiled baking sheet. Bake in hot oven (450x F)
about 15 minutes. This dough will keep for 1 week or 10 days in a
refrigerator if it is worked down each day to prevent its becoming
too light.  The dough should be kept closely covered with waxed paper
to prevent a crust from forming over the surface. 32 rolls.
