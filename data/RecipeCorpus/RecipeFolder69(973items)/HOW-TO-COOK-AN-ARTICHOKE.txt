Title: HOW TO COOK AN ARTICHOKE
Categories: Vegetables, Info
Yield: 1 Servings  Remove any damaged or discolored leaves from the outside of the
artichoke. With a sharp knife, cut the stem off flush at the bottom
so that the artichoke will stand upright without tipping.

Simmer the artichoke, covered, in about 3/4" of water for 25 to 35
minutes. The artichoke is done when a leaf plucked from near the
center comes off easily. Drain the artichoke upside down.

With the exception of the hairy "choke" in the middle, the entire
artichoke is edible, although most of the leaf is tough and usually
only the pasty part of the inside of the leaf is eaten (scraped off
with your teeth!). The best part is the base of the artichoke, which
has a mellow, sweet flavor.

Artichokes are traditionally served with a dip of some sort -- usually
melted butter, but mayonnaise or vinaigrette is equally delicious.
