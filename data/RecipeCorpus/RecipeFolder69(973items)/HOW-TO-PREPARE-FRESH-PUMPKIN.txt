Title: HOW TO PREPARE FRESH PUMPKIN
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 Servings
Directions
Break off the pumpkin stem, cut the pumpkin in half crosswise and
scoop out the seeds and stringy material. Save the seeds for the
recipe I posted the other day.

Place the halves, cut sides up, on a foil lined baking sheet. Cover
and seal each half with foil.

Bake in a preheated 350 Degree F. oven until the flesh is very tender,
about 1 1/2 hours.  Cool until able to handle.

Scoop out the flesh and mash with a potato masher, puree in a blender
or processor, or push through a fine sieve. If the puree is too
watery, drain in a colander lined with cheesecloth, folding the
cheesecloth over the puree and weighing down with a plate. Puree will
keep up to 5 days in the refrigerator and up to 6 months in the
freezer.
