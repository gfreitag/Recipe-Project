4 c  All-Purpose Flour -- Sifted
2 ts Baking Powder

Make Filling: In a 3 quart saucepan, place prunes and 2 cups water;
heat to boiling. Reduce heat, and simmer, covered, 30 minutes, or
until prunes are very tender.

Drain prunes, reserving liquid. Chop prunes finely. Add 3/4 cup
granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla; the cardamom, 1/4 teaspoon
salt, and 1/2 cup reserved cooking liquid; mix until ingredients are
well blended. Set aside to cool.

Make torte layers: Sift flour with baking powder and salt. In a large
bowl, with electric mixer at high speed, beat butter with granulated
sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each addition. At low speed, add flour mixture
alternately with milk, beginning and ending with flour mixture.
Refrigerate dough until chilled and easy to handle-about 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Divide dough into 7 equal pieces. For
each layer, invert an 8-inch round layer cake pan. Flatten a piece of
dough with hands; place on pan; pat to fit. Then gently roll to make
layer even; trim edge if necessary. Keep pieces of dough refrigerated
until ready to use. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until edge is golden
brown. Carefully remove to wire rack; let cool. To assemble: Place
one layer on serving plate; spread with about 1/2 cup filling. Repeat
with 5 more layers and remaining filling. Set last layer on top.
Cover completely with plastic film or foil. Refrigerate at least 24
hours, to mellow. To serve: Sprinkle top with confectioners sugar.
Cut in thin slices. Pass whipped cream. Return unused portion to
refrigerator.
