4 tb Butter
2 1/2 c  Onions; chop
2 1/2 c  Raw long-grain rice
1 c  Dry white wine
5 c  Chicken broth
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 lb Swiss cheese; grate
2 tb Butter
7 oz Can mushrooms
2 tb Parsley; chop
Note: Captain Kirk's first visit to the Iotians came at a particularly
turbulent time in their gang wars, so he saw nothing of their family
life. When he returned a year later with Isak Wharton, a Federation
economist, to supervise the reinvestment of the Federation's "cut",
the situation was already much improved, and life was more relaxed.
When Angela Oxmyx had the Captain, Wharton, and the Krackos over for
dinner, this is one the things she served. Melt the butter in a
4-quart pot and fry the onions in it until golden. Add the rice,
stirring until it is well-coated with butter. Add the white wine and
broth (which can be part chicken broth and part water) and salt.
Bring to a boil, cover and simmer until the rice is tender. The
liquid will be absorbed, but the rice will not be dry and fluffy.
Cooking time from when the rice starts to boil until it is tender
should be about 20 minutes. Add the Swiss cheese, stirring to mix it
in well and to melt it. Take the pot off the heat and set aside,
covered. Melt the butter in the saucepan and add the drained
mushrooms. Cook them a few minutes until they are thoroughly hot. Do
not brown them. Put the cooked rice in a large bowl, sprinkle with
the parsley and then pour the mushrooms over all. Serve immediately.
