Categories: Vegetarian, Breakfast
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------OMELET--------------------------------
1 lb Tofu, Chinese, firm
1 c  Soymilk
1/4 ts Salt
1    Onion, green; finely chopped
MMMMM----------------------RANCHEROS SAUCE---------------------------
1 ts Vegetable oil
2    Garlic cloves; chopped
2    Onions; chopped
1    Pepper, green; seeded and
--chopped
4 lg Mushrooms; halved and sliced
2 lg Tomatoes; seeded and chopped

1. Preheat the oven to 400 deg. To make the omelet, drain and crumble
the tofu. Place the tofu, soymilk, and salt into a blender and blend
until smooth. Stir in the green onion. Lightly oil two 9-inch pie
pans, preferably glass. Divide the omelet mixture between the pans,
smooth out the top with a spatula, and bake for about 35 minutes. The
edges will become brown, the top will become golden and the tofu will
have the texture of an omelet. When the omelets are cooked, loosen
them from the pie pans with a sharp spatula and cut them in half.

2. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add all the ingredients and cook,
covered, over medium heat for 5 minutes. Uncover and cook another 5
minutes.

3. Place half of the omelet on each plate and cover with the Ranchero
sauce.
