Italian (Cooked) Meringue

Combine  sugar and water in saucepan and stir well. Cook over
medium-high heat  but do not stir; swirl pan by handle until mixture
comes to a boil. Let it boil until liquid becomes completely clear.

Reduce  heat;  cover pan and continue to simmer  while beating
whites. Beat whites slowly until foamy.  Then beat in cream of tartar
and salt. Increase speed and beat whites until stiff peaks form.
Uncover sugar syrup; insert candy thermometer  and boil until
temperature reaches 238 degrees, or soft ball stage. Remove from
heat; start to beat whites at medium speed and slowly pour boiling
syrup into whites, beating all the time. Continue to beat until
mixture forms stiff peaks, about 8 minutes.

The meringue is the proper consistency if it does not move when a
spatula is run through it.
