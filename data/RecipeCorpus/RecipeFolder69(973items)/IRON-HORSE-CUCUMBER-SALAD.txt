Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Salads, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lg Cucumbers
-- peeled, seeded and diced
1 lg Onion
-- peeled, sliced paper thin
1 lg Bunch radishes; trimmed
-- sliced in thin rounds
1    Green bell pepper; cored
-- seeded, in thin strips
1 sm Fresh cilantro bunch*
3/4 c  Rice wine vinegar
1 tb Fresh ginger; minced
Salt and pepper; to taste
*Cilantro should be rinsed, dried and with stems removed, to equal
about 1 and 1/2 cups loosely packed leaves.

Put cucumbers, onion, radishes and bell pepper in a large bowl; toss
well. If they are not prechilled, cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Mince cilantro leaves.

Drizzle rice wine vinegar over vegetables, sprinkle the cilantro and
ginger over them, and toss thoroughly to combine. Season to taste and
serve immediately.

Loomis writes: "The key to this salad...is to use the freshest,
crispest vegetables you can find.  It should be served chilled to get
the best effect, but you can avoid a time lag between preparation and
serving by refrigerating the vegetables for several hours before
beginning, so they go chilled right into the bowl.

"The amount of onion you use depends on whether or not you're a real
onion fan.  I love a sweet onion in this salad, but if you're
onion-shy, use half the amount called for. The recipe did not
originally call for salt and pepper, and it does not need it, but you
should adjust the seasoning to your taste."
