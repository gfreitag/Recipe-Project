Title: Cinnamon-Raisin Bread
Categories: Bread
Yield: 2 servings
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1 1/2 c  Whole-wheat flour
2    Eggs, beaten
3 1/2 c  Flour, or more as needed
Milk, for brushing dough
4 ts Cinnamon, mixed with:>>>>>>
2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Warm (110 F. ) water
1 pk Dry yeast
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Milk
1/2    Stick unsalted butter
1 tb Salt
Set raisins to soak in hot tap water to cover.  Combine warm water
yeast with a pinch of sugar and let sit untill foamy, abt 10 min.

Heat milk, remaining sugar, butter, salt and nutmeg until the mixture
is lukewarm and butter is partly melted.  Pour into lge. mixing bowl.
Beat in wheat flour, then yeast mixture, eggs, and 3 cups of
all-purpose flour. Knead on lightly floured surface, add flour as
necessary to make a med. soft but manageable dough.

Form dough into a ball and turn it around in a buttered bowl; place
buttered side up.  Cover bowl and let rise in warm, draft-free place
until doubled in bulk. Abt. 1 hr.

Punch dough down, turn out onto lightly floured surface and divide in
half. Roll each half into rectangle 7 x 20 in.  Brush surface of each
with milk and sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar mixture.  Drain raisins,
pat dry, and sprinkle evenly over both halves of dough.   Roll each
loaf, starting with short end, tightly and pinch ends closed. Place
each loaf, seam side down, in greased 8 x 4 loaf pan.  Cover pans
with towel and let rise untill almost doubled in bulk, abt. 1 hr.

Preheat oven to 350 F. while loaves are rising and bake in center of
oven until golden brown, abt. 45 min.  Turn loaves out of pan and
onto racks to cool, covered with towell.  For best results, wrap
loaves in plastic wrap and let mellow overnight (if you can keep your
hands off).
