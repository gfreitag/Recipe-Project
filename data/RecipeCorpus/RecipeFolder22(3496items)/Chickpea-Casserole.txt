Soak the chickpeas overnight in water to cover. (Or use the
quick-soaking method.) Drain and add water to cover to a depth of
1*". Add salt and simmer two hours or longer, until the chickpeas are
tender.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a saucepan, add the onions and cook until
wilted. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, water and spices. Add the
chickpeas and simmer 30 minutes longer. Serve hot over rice,
garnished with onion rings and coriander.

Makes 12 or more servings.
