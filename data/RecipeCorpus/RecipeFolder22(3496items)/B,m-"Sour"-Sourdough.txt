This basic recipe was from Anna Ellis (DMSD70C). I substituted oil
for the margarine and with some experimentation, came up with this
technique: Put all ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle.
When the cycle is complete, leave the dough in the pan for 3 to 4
more hours. Remove dough and squeeze out gases. Cover with a damp
towel and let it rest for 20 or 30 minutes minutes. Sprinkle corn
meal on a board and shape dough into two cylindrical loaves. Place
loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet. Cover again with the damp
towel and allow to rise for another two hours. At the end of two
hours, refrigerate the dough, still covered, for at least 12 hours
(the longer the better). Take dough out of the refer, sprinkle with
water, and let it sit out for 4 hours. Sprinkle again with water then
bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until brown and crusty.
