Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 lb Sharp Cheddar cheese
- shredded
1/2 ts Salt
Freshly ground pepper
- to taste
4 tb Unsalted butter
4 md Onions; peeled and sliced
4 c  Veal stock
-=OR=- Low-sodium beef broth
1/8 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
12 oz Dark beer
IN A 3-QUART HEAVY POT, preferably cast iron or copper, melt the
butter over low heat, add the onions and cook, covered, for 15
minutes. Uncover and continue to cook until the onions turn a deep
golden color, about 30 to 40 minutes, depending on your pot. Stir
frequently. Add the broth and the nutmeg, cover and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small pot,
bring the beer to a boil over medium heat and boil until the liquid
has reduced by half. Remove from the heat and add the Cheddar cheese,
stirring until melted. Transfer this mixture to a blender. Add 1 cup
of the onion soup and blend until smooth. Reserve. Remove the onion
mixture from the heat and strain. Reserve the liquid. Transfer the
onions to a blender or food processor and puree until very smooth.
Return the puree to the pot, add the reserved liquid and the Cheddar
cheese mixture. Taste for salt and pepper. Serve piping hot in a
tureen.
