Categories: Dessert
Yield: 24 servings
6    Large eggs
2 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Sifted cake flour
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1 c  Pecans, chopped med. fine
1/4 c  Kahlua
1 ts Instant coffee crystals
3 oz Unsweetened chocolate
2 oz Seni-sweet chocolate
1 c  Butter
1/2 c  Shortening
Line bottom of a jelly roll pan (15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1 inch) with baking
parchment and grease sides of pan.  Mix kahlua and coffee crystals.
Melt chocolate, butter and shortening together over very low heat,
and cool slightly.  Beat eggs lightly, add sugar and continue beating
until thick and light colored.  Slowly stir in kahlua and chocolate
mixtures.  Resift flour with baking powder and salt into batter, and
mix until smooth.  Turn into prepared pan and level top.  Sprinkle
nuts evenly over top.  Bake on center rack of 350 degree oven, about
25 minutes, just until cake tests dome.  Cool in pan on wire rack.
To serve...cut into small 1 1/2 inch squares or sieve powdered sugar
over top and cut.  Or, cut into 2 1/2 inch squares and serve tipped
with ice cream and drizzle of chocolate sauce. Or, for a more lavish
dessert, put 2 of the larger squares together with ice cream between
and top with a rosette of whipped cream. Posted by Kay Mainguth in
