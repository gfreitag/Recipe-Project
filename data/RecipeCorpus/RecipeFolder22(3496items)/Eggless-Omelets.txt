Title: Eggless Omelets
Categories: Vegetarian, Breakfast
Yield: 6 servings
3 c  Water
1 tb Oil
2 c  Flour, unbleached
1/3 c  Nutritional yeast flakes
1/2 ts Baking powder
Combine all ingredients in a blender.

Whip up batter until smooth. It can rest for 30 minutes to overnight
in the refrigerator. Heat a 9-inch skillet and when hot put a few
drops of oil on the bottom.

Rotate the pan to coat the bottom. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into pan
and immediately tilt and coat the pan so batter forms an evn later
over the whole bottom.
Cook over medium high heat until the top starts to dry up and the
edges loosen. Slide pancake turner under it, flip over and cook the
other side. Besides serving as litle omelets, these can be rolled up
like crepes.

Especially good wrapped around some sauteed mushrooms or ratatouille.
