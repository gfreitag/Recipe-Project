In a blender or food processor fitted with the steel blade, puree the
peppers.  Turn into a medium-size saucepan. Add the vinegar and bring
to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer 5 minutes. Cool, then strain
juice through a strainer lined with two layers of cheesecloth.
Squeeze to extract all the juices. Discard the solids. Add the sugar
to the juice and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer 10
minutes. Add the pectin and boil 1 minute. Pour into clean sterilized
jars and process according to manufacturer's directions.  Store in a
cool dry place. Once opened, store the jelly in the refrigerator.
