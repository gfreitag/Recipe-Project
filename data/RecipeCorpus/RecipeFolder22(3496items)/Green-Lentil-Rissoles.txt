Title: Green Lentil Rissoles
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Parsley
2 oz Oats
2 oz Breadcrumbs
---Yogurt sauce
Oil for frying
1/2 pt Yogurt
2 tb Parsley
1 tb Chives
1    Garlic clove, crushed
1/4 ts Cumin
Lemon juice
Salt & pepper to taste
8 oz Green lentils
1 pt Hot water
2 oz Margarine
1    Onion, finely chopped
1    Carrot, chopped
1    Green bell pepper, diced
2    Garlic cloves, crushed
1/4 ts Cayenne
1/2 ts Coriander
1/2 ts Cumin
1/2 ts Curry powder
2 ts Tomato paste
Salt & pepper
Put lentils & hot water into a pot.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat &
simmer, covered for 30 minutes.

Heat margarine in a skillet, add onion & cook for 2 minutes.  Add
carrot & pepper & cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add
spices, paste, salt & pepper.  Mix together well.Then stir in lentils
& let cool.  Mix in parsley.

Divide the mixture into 12 equal portions & shape into rounds.  Coat
them in combined breadcrumbs & oats (oats may have to be blended to
resemble fine breadcrumbs).  Shallow fry in hot oil until golden
brown on both sides.  Drain well.

For the yogurt sauce, combine all the ingredients & chill till ready
to serve.

I find that I do not need to roll the rissoles in egg, though the
recipe calls for it.
