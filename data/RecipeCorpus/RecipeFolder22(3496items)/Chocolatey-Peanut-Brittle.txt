Adding chocolate to peanut brittle makes the brittle taste different
from any you've ever had before.

Lightly butter a cookie sheet and set aside.  In a small bowl, stir
together the cocoa and baking soda then add the butter.  Set aside.
In a heavy 2 quart saucepan, stir together the sugar, corn syrup, and
whipping cream.  Cook, over medium heat, stirring constantly until
the sugar is dissolved.  Stir in the peanuts.  Continue cooking,
stirring frequently, until the mixture reaches 300 Degrees F. or when
syrup dropped into very cold water separates into threads which are
hard and brittle. (Make sure that the bulb of the candy thermometer
is not resting on the bottom of the pan when using one.) Remove from
the heat and stir in the cocoa mixture. Immediately pour onto the
prepared cookie sheet. With tongs or wooden spoons, quickly spread
and pull into a 1/4-inch thickness. Place the cookie sheet on a wire
rack to cool completely. When the candy is cold, snap into pieces and
store in a tightly covered container.
