Pick over lentils to remove any small stones.  Rinse lentils under
cold water and set aside.

In medium-sized saucepan over medium heat, combine 2 T olive oil and
garlic; cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned, stirring
often. Add tomato, celery, carrot, and onion. Cook 2 minutes longer,
stirring often. Add lentils and salt and pepper to taste; stir to
blend lentils. Add enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Reduce
heat to low; cover and simmer 45 minutes or until lentils are tender.
Remove from heat and serve warm, or cool to room temperature. Stir in
remaining 1 tsp olive oil just before serving and sprinkle with
chopped tomato. Garnish with curly lettuce.
