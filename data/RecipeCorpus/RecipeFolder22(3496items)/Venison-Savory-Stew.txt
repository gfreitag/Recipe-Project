Title: Venison Savory Stew
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 8 servings
6 ea Med bannana peppers, chopped
4 ea Small potatoes, quartered
1 ea Indiv box of Fiber One
1 pk Top Ramen Beef fl.noodles
4 ea Triscuit Snack Crackers
1/4 pk Ranch Dip Mix(-sourcream)
2 lb Venison Roast (Boneless)
1/2 c  White Wine
1/8 c  Worcestershire Sauce
1 c  Lentils
1 ea Large cucumber, diced
1 ea Jalepeno pepper, diced
Do not skin, peel, or otherwise denude the vegetables or potatoes.
Wash them briskley and then cut them up.  The good stuff is in the
skin, always, as the skin is what was intended to serve, protect and
defend the pulp and seeds. Fill large crock pot half full of clean
cold water. Add ingredients. Let cook on low heat for 12-16 hours.
Season as desired during last 1 hour of cooking, adding bay, etc., as
suits your individual collection of buds. This recipe may be done
with any game animal, except that squirrel tends to be far too
stringy for my taste.  If you like hearty and thick, this stew is for
you.  It would also go well with beef, obviously.
I do recommend a bay leaf added to the top for the last hour.
