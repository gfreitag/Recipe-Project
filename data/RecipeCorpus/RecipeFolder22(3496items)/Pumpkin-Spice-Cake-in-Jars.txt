Title: Pumpkin Spice Cake in Jars
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 8 servings
2 ts GROUND CINNAMON
1 ts GROUND GINGER
4    EGGS
2 c  GRANULATED SUGAR
1 c  SALAD OIL
16 oz Canned PUMPKIN
1 c  SEEDLESS RAISINS
1 c  WALNUTS
2 c  ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
2 ts BAKING SODA
1/4 ts BAKING POWDER
1/2 ts SALT
2 ts GROUND CLOVES
Preheat oven to 325-degrees.

Sterilize 8 (12 oz) Ball Quilted Crystal Canning Jars (14400-81400),
lids and rings by boiling them for 10 minutes. Leave the lids and
rings in the hot water until you're ready to use them; remove jars
and allow the jars to air-dry and cool. Prepare the batter in the
meantime.
Using a pastry brush, brush the inside of the cooled jars with
shortening (DO NOT use Pam or Baker's Secret); set aside.

Coarsely chop the raisins and walnuts; set aside.
Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cloves,
cinnamon and ginger in a large bowl. Add raisins and walnuts; toss to
lightly combine.

In another large bowl, beat eggs at high speed until thick and
yellow (2-3 minutes). Gradually beat in the sugar until thick and
light. At low speed, beat in the oil and pumpkin; blend well.
Gradually stir in the flour mixture until well blended.

Divide among the 8 canning jars (should be slightly less than 1/2
full. Wipe the sides of the jar off (inside/ outside) in case you
slop or it'll burn. Place jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll tip
over.

Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until a pick inserted into the center of
each jar comes out clean.
Have your lids and rings ready. Take one jar at a time from the oven;
place a lid and ring on and screw down tightly. Use HEAVY-DUTY
mitts--the jars are HOT! Place the jars onto your counter top too
cool. You'll know when they've sealed, you'll hear a "plinking sound".
