*DIRECTIONS*

BLANCHING TECHNIQUE: Bring 1-quart of water to boil. Submerge
tomatoes in boiling water for 3 minutes to reconstitute. Take 4 aside
and cut into strips.

In a food processor, combine cream cheese, butter, Parmesan, olive
oil and remaining sun-dried tomatoes.  Process until smooth. Place in
refrigerator for about 30 minutes, or until firm enough to shape into
a ball. Place cheese ball on a platter. Arrange basil leaves and
reserved tomato strips around cheese ball like a sunburst. To serve,
spread on your favorite crackers.

Makes 2-1/2 cups.

Recipe from Melissa's brand Sun-dried Tomatoes.

This recipe was called "Dried Tomato Dip" but I sure didn't see it as
a dip so I renamed it.  I guess it could be a spread, but sure can't
see "dipping" anything into this as it would be too stiff.
