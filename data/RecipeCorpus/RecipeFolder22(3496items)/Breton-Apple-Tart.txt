Try substituting firm-ripe peaches for the apples in this filling for
a seasonal variation.

FOR THE APPLE FILLING: PEEL, CORE AND SLICE THE apples into a large
saucepan. Add the remaining ingredients and cook the apples covered
until they exude their juices. Uncover the apples, lower the heat and
allow juices to evaporate. Cool the filling.

FOR THE BRETON DOUGH: BEAT THE BUTTER UNTIL SOFT using a hand mixer
set at medium speed or a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle.
Beat in the sugar in a stream. Continue beating until the mixture
lightens. Beat in the rum and vanilla, then the yolks, one at a time,
beating until the mixture is very smooth and light. Using a rubber
spatula, fold in the flour by hand, until the dough is smooth.
Preheat the oven to 350F and set a rack in the lowest level. Butter a
10-by-2-inch-deep layer pan. Cut a disk of parchment or wax paper and
place in the bottom of the pan; butter the paper. Place half the
dough in the pan and use a spatula to spread it evenly over the
bottom of the pan. Spread the cooled filling on the dough. Flour the
remaining dough and press it into a 10-inch disk on a cardboard or
tart-pan bottom. Slide the dough over the filling and press it into
place making sure that the sides are straight and even. Brush the top
of the Breton with a beaten egg yolk. Bake for 40-45 minutes, until
well colored. Cool on a rack.

VARIATION: BRETON WALNUT TART:

FOR THE WALNUT FILLING: BRING SUGAR, BUTTER AND HONEY to a boil,
stirring occasionally. Boil 2 minutes. Stir in walnuts and cool.
Proceed as for Breton Apple Tart, above.
