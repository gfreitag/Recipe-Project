Use a 3-quart casserole with lid.  An earthenware casserole is
preferable, especially if you wish to add a touch of Spain to a
dinner party. However, I know that good earthenware is hard to find
today.  I have 2 casseroles that I've had for 15 years.

Heat oil in casserole.  Saute onion and pepper until transparent.  Add
garlic, parsley, tomato, bay leaf, nutmeg, cumin and thyme.  Mix well,
cover, and cook over low heat until mushy (about 15 minutes).  The
saffron should be toasting on the lid in the little brown paper.

Add the shrimp to the saute and cook until it turns pink.  Dissolve
the saffron in the 1 cup hot water.  Combine with wine, lemon juice,
salt and hot sauce.  Pour into casserole, stir to mix, and cook
covered 10 minutes more.  Now add the rice and the 2 1/2 cups of
water.  Distribute ingredients well in casserole.  Bring to a quick
boil, STIR ONCE, and place in preheated 325 degree F. oven for only
20 minutes - NI UN MINUTO MAS! Remove from oven, uncover, and garnish
with peas, pimientos, and parsley. Pour beer over all.  Cover again
and allow to stand 15 minutes longer, before serving.
