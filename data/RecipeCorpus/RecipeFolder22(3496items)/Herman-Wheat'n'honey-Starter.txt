-Deborah Seckinger GDJF29B
1 tb Ginger
1/2 c  Honey;or brown sugar
1/3 c  Warm water
Sprinkle ginger and 1 T honey or brown sugar over warm water. Sprinkle
yeast over this and stir. Let stand in warm place about 10 minutes
till doubled in size. Mix milk, rest of honey or brown sugar, flours
into yeast mixture in a glass container about the size of a gallon
pyrex jar. Stir, using only a wooden spoon, since metal objects will
retard herman's growth. Leave the cover on lossely or place a glass
plate over the top of the container. So Herman can breathe. Herman
doubles, enen tripples at time of vigorous rising. Place Herman in a
warm place overnight. Next day refridgerate, Lossely covered and stir
each day. This is very important with wheat and honey starter as more
gasses form in the container and are released during stirring.
Formation of this gas may cause the starter to appear darker on the
top than on the bottom. But this is okay. On the 5 th day measure out
1 cup herman for baking and another to give to a friend if you wish.
Then feed what herman you have left thusly: FEEDING HERMAN 1/2 CUP
