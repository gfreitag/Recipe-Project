Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Canola oil (or other oil)
1 c  ;water
2 c  Sesame oil, canola oil or
-other oil, for frying
Southern Country Gravy
1 lb Tofu, firm
3 tb Vogue Vegy Base
1 1/4 c  Flour, unbleached
2 tb Flour, gluten
1 ts Salt
4 tb Spice Blend
Drain and rinse the tofu. Slice it horizontally into two even
pieces. Then cut each of these pieces into 8 cubes. Place all the
cubes in a bowl and add 1 tbs soup base. Gently mix well and set
aside.

Stir together 1/2 cup of the unbleached flour and the remaining 2
tbs of soup base. Set aside this breading mixture.

Mix the remaining 3/4 cup of unbleached flour, gluten flour, salt and
spice blend. Blend well so the gluten flour does not create lumps.
Stir in the water and 1 tbs of canola oil. If the gluten flour
creates lumps, blend the batter in a blender.

Heat the oil in a deep skillet. Dip a piece of tofu into the breading
mixture and coat it completely. Then dip it into the battter, using
prongs. Remove and hold it above the batter for abuot 10 seconds,
tapping it gently against the side of the bowl to release excess
batter. Then hold about one third of the piece of tofu in the hot oil
for about 15 secnds to sear the bottom so it won't stick to the pan.
Release the tofu and let it completely submerge. Repeat for the other
peices.
Deep-fry the tofu to a light brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and
drain on paper towels for 30 seconds. You can place the tofu in the
oven at 250 degrees for up to 15 minutes to retain crispness.

To serve, pour equal portions of the Southern Country Gravy into each
plate and set the hot fried tofu into the gravy.
