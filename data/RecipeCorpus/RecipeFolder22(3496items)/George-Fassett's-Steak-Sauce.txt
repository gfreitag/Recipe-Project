Title: George Fassett's Steak Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
2    Or 3 shakes of soy sauce
Salt and pepper
3 tb Ketsup
1 ts Worchestershire sauce
"Here's a very quick and easy steak sauce, mimicking A-1 sauce..I've
never measured any of it, just put it together....

Take all ingredients and put it in a cup and mix well. You can vary
the flavour you like the best, or jazz it up with more seasonings
(garlic? celery salt? thyme?) or even add a drop or two of smoke
flavoring. Regardless, it does well in a pinch when you don't have
any A-1 in the house."
