Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
3    Carrots, diced
1 ts Salt
3 tb Braggs aminos
Water
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
2 c  Dried split peas
3 md Yams, peeled and diced
3    Leeks, diced
2 tb Sliced fresh ginger
4    Celery stalks, diced
Place all the ingredients except the cayenne pepper in a large pot.
Add water so that there are 2 inches of water over the vegetables.
Cover, bring to a boil, turn down the heat and simmer for 2 hours, or
until all the ingredients are mushy.  Stir often to prevent sticking.
If the soup becomes too thick while it is cooking, add some boiling
water, or your can thin it with a bit of water at the end of the
cooking time for a lighter soup. Add cayenne pepper, adjust the
seasonings, and serve.
