Title: Meetha Kaddoo (Braised Butternut Squash with Jaggery)
Categories: Indian, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
Salt, kosher; to taste
1 ts Mango powder
3 tb Jaggery, powdered
1    Squash, butternut
3 tb Oil
1/2 ts Fenugreek seeds
1/2 ts Hing
1 tb Coriander, ground
Place the squash on the side on a cutting board.  Using a sharp
knife, cut its stem end off, then halve it (if necessary use a mallet
to force the blade of the knife into the squash).  Scoop out the
seeds and fibers from each squash half, the scrape the flesh to
remove clinging fibers. Cut each half into 1 1/2 inch wedges and peel
the hard skin off. Cut the meat into 1 1/2 inch pieces and set aside.

Measure out the spices and place them right next to the stove in
separate piles.  Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high
heat until very hot.  Add the fenugreek seeds and fry until they turn
dark brown (about 10 seconds) add the asafetida, coriander, and
pepper. Stir once and immediately add the squash.  Stir rapidly to
distribute the spices (about 3 to 4 minutes).  Sprinkle on salt to
taste; stir. Lower the heat and cook, covered, until the squash is
cooked but still holding its shape (about 15 minutes). Uncover and
sprinkle on the mango powder. Reduce the heat to medium and turn-fry
for 2 minutes. Add the jaggery and cook until it melts and coats the
vegetables (3-4 minutes). Serve warm, at room temperature, or cold.
