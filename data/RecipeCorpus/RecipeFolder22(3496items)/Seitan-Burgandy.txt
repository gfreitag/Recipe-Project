Title: Seitan Burgandy
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
-several cloves garlic
2 ts Sage
1    -2 teaspoons thyme
1 c  Rich red wine
-salt and pepper to taste
-water
-flour
1    8 ounce package water
-packed seitan, cut into
3/4    Inch chunks
3 lg Potatoes, similar sized
-cubes
6    Carrots, sliced
1    Onion, chopped coursley
I did not rinse the seitan, I did toss the seasoned water it was
packed in. Put all ingredients in a large pot of dutch over, add
water to just cover. Simmer for an hour or so. Put 2 - 3 tablespons
flour in a small jar, add water, shake till smooth, add graduaslly to
simmering stew to thicken as desired. Yum

I served it in bowls, as is, would be very nice over noodles, rice,
etc.

Obviously, add whatever veggies you prefer.  Mushrooms would be a
perfect addition. Jan
