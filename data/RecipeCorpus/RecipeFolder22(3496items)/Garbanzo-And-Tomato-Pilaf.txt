Garbanzo beans are also called ceci or chickpeas. They are a good
source of protein in this meatless dish.

thyme sprigs or a pinch of dried 2 lge tomatoes, peeled, seeded and
finely chopped 1 1/2 C cooked garbanzo beans Salt and pepper, to
taste 2 C water Chopped parsley

RINSE THE RICE, cover with hot water, and set aside. Heat the butter
in a large pot and add the bay leaf, garlic and thyme. Add the
tomatoes and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently. Add the
garbanzo beans and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes. Drain the
rice. Add the water to the tomatoes and garbanzo beans and add the
salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, stir in the rice, cover and cook
until the liquid is absorbed, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat,
cover the pilaf with a clean cloth, cover with the pot lid and let
stand for 30 minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve garnished with
parsley.
