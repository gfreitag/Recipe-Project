Yield: 8 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1    Pie shell, 9", unbaked
2 tb Butter
1/4 c  Brown sugar; firmly packed
1 c  Pecan halves
1/4 c  Bourbon; divided
3    Egg; slightly beaten
16 oz Pumpkin
3/4 c  Brown sugar; firmly packed
1 1/2 c  Half & half
3 tb Bourbon
1 ts Cinnamon, ground
1/2 ts Ginger powder
Combine eggs, pumpkin, 3/4 cup sugar, half-and-half, 3 tablespoons
bourbon, cinnamon, ginger, and salt; mix well.  Pour mixture into the
pie shell; bake at 425 for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350, and bake
an additional 45 minutes or until set.  Set aside to cool. Combine
butter and 1/4 cup brown sugar in a saucepan; cook over medium heat,
stirring until sugar dissolved. Add pecans and 2 tablespoons bourbon,
stirring to coat. Spoon mixture over the pie. Heat the remaining
bourbon in a saucepan just long enough to produce fumes (do not
boil); remove from heat, ignite, and pour over pie. Serve pie when
flames die down.
