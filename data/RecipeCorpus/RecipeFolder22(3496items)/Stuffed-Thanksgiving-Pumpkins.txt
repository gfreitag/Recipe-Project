Preheat oven to 350 degres. Slice off the top 1/2 inch of each

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat stock or water to
simmering until onions are softened but not browned. Add garlic,
sage, thyme, and bread crumbs. Cook, stirring, 1 minute, then remeove

lightly oiled baking dish.)

Bake for 15 minutes, or until stuffing is lightly browned and heated
through. Be careful not to overbake the pumpkins, because they will
split. Serves 8.
