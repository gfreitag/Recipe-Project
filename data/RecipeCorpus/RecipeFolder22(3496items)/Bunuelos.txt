Here is a local recipe for a sweet crunchy treat that you usually see
at festivals with confectioners sugar all over them.  They sell in
bags of about a dozen.  I found the mexican recipe book!!

Sift together dry ingredients.  Combine beaten eggs with milk.  Fold
in dry ingredients and add melted butter.  On floured board knead
dough as you do for bread.

Make into small balls and roll out to about five inches.  Fry in hot
fat about one minute on each side.Prick with fork while cooking.
Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.
