DRESSING Mix dressing ingredients up together. Break tofu up into
small bite sized pieces. (sorry I didn't get the amounts for the
dressing, but he was going so fast, I missed it if he gave actual
amounts...) Allow to sit while preparing the rest of the salad.

SALAD Mix all salad ingredients except for the YA beans together in a
bowl. Save three Ya beans for each plate. Braid them (as in hair) and
lay the braided Ya bean around the side of each salad plate. If there
is any leftover Ya beans, chop them and add to salad. Once salad has
been thoroughly tossed, place mound on each plate. Pour dressing over
top and serve immediately.
