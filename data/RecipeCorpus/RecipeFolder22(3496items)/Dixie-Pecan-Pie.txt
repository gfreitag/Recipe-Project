little pecan lore from Craig Claiborne:

"Pecans are, to my mind, the most Southern of nuts.  One authority I
know states that they were grown in Virginia long before George
Washington was born and that the name derives from the American
Indian word 'pakan'. The earliest colonists in Virginia and North
Carolina transliterated the word as 'pagan' and as a result, the
Pagan River, which flows through Smithfield, Virginia, was named for
the abundance of pecan trees that grew along its shores and not for
any pagans who lived nearby."

Cooking by Wesley Pitts.
