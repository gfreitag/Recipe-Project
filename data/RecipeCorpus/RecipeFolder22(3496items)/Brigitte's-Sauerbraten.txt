Title: Brigitte's Sauerbraten
Categories: Meat
Yield: 4 servings
2    Peppercorns
5    Strips of bacon
1/2 l  Water
1 cn (small) tomato paste
3 tb Cornstarch
2    Carrots, sliced
2 lb Boneless roast beef
1/2 l  Buttermilk
1 c  Red wine
1    Bayleaf
1    Onion, sliced
2    Cloves
1. Put the meat in a ceramic or glass bowl. Pour the buttermilk,
wine, and bayleaf over the meat. Add the peppercorns and onions. Keep
in the refrigerator for at least 3 days, marinating the meat daily.

2. After 3 days, remove meat from the refrigerator. In a deep Dutch
oven, fry the bacon and set aside. Put meat in the bacon drippings
and brown on all sides quickly. Add 3 Tablespoons of the marinade
(liquid only) and cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the water,
tomato paste, and carrots. Crumble the bacon and add to the meat.

3. Cover and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours, making sure to watch the
level of fluids in the dutch oven. Replace with water if it gets too
low. When the meat is done, remove the meat and the carrots and keep
warm. Stir in the cornstarch to thicken the juices and boil for a
short time to the desired consistency.

4. Slice the meat and serve with the gravy and potato dumplings or
wide noodles (other German choices include boiled potatoes or baked
potatoes) and the carrots.
