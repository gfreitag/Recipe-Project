Title: Celery-Apple Salad with Currants
Categories: Salad, Fruit, Apples
Yield: 6 servings
-left in large pieces
2 tb Walnut oil
Lemon juice
-=OR=- Champagne vinegar
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
1/2 c  Dried currants
1 lg Head celery
2    Golden Delicious apples
6    Pale green celery leaves
4    Parsley sprigs
10    Walnuts; cracked
IF THE CURRANTS ARE HARD, cover them with warm water and set them
aside to soften while you cut the celery and apples. When they're
soft, after 10 minutes or so, drain them and squeeze out the water.
Separate the stalks of celery and peel the tougher outer stalks.
Slice the celery into thin pieces, straight across or at an angle.
Cut the apples into quarters or sixths if they're large and thinly
slice them crosswise. Finely chop the celery leaves and the parsley
and crack the nuts. Combine the celery, apples, currants, celery
leaves, parsley and walnuts in a bowl. Toss them with just enough
walnut oil to coat everything lightly. Add the lemon juice or vinegar
to taste, salt lightly, season with pepper and toss again.
