It is very important that oil be hot for this recipe. Test the
temperature by dropping some of the flour coating into the oil. If it
bubbles rapidly, your oil is probably hot enough. It should take abt.
20 min. to heat up.

To make a "deluxe" chicken sandwich, simply add two tomato slices and
a leaf of lettuce. Mayonaise also goes well on this sandwich--it is a
side order at the restaurant.
