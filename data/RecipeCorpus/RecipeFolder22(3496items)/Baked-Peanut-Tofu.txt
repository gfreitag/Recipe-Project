Title: Baked Peanut Tofu
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 3 servings
--pressed
1 c  ;water
1 1/2 tb Arrowroot
1 lb Tofu, firm
4 tb Peanut butter
2 tb Tamari, or more to taste
1    Garlic clove (or more);
Cut the tofu into small rectangles about 1/4--1/2" thick.

In a small bowl, mix together the peanut butter, tamari, and garlic.
Slowly stir in the water. Mix well.

Place the tofu slices in a shallow dish and pour the liquid over it.
Let the tofu marinate for at least 30 minutes. If desired, you may
leave it for several hours or overnight. In this case, keep it
refrigerated while it is marinating.

When you are ready to cook, remove th pieces of tofu from the
marinade and place them on a well-oiled cookie sheet. Reserve the
liquied to make the sauce.

Bake at 375 deg for 30-45 minutes, or until the desired crispness is
reached (the longer the tofu bakes, the crisper it becomes).

Mix the arrowroot with the remaining marinade. Place the mixture in a
saucepan and cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce
thickens.

Place the baked tofu on a bed of cooked grains (rice, millet,
buckwheat or even pasta). Cover with the sauce.

Serve with steamed or stir-fried vegetables and a salad.
