Categories: Vegetarian, Appetizer
Yield: 16 servings
2    Parsley sprigs
3 tb Arrowroot
4 tb ;water
2 tb Smoked yeast
1 ts Sea salt
2 pn Ground nutmeg
2 c  Split peas, dried
4 c  ;water
1    4-inch strip kombu
1 md Carrot; halved lengthwise
6    Garlic cloves
1/4 sm Onion
1    Bay leaf
Wash the split peas, sort out any tiny rocks or odd peas, and put
the peas in a medium saucepan with the water. Add the kombu, carrot,
garlic, onion, bay leaf, and parsley. Cover the pan tightly and
simmer until the peas are very soft (about 35 to 40 minutes). the
mixture should be cooked until there is very little, if any, liquid
left.

Remove the bay leaf and parsley. Pour the mixture into the blender
(in two batches), and blend until smooth.
Return to the pan.

In a small bowl, mix the arrowroot, water, yeast, salt and nutmeg.
Add these seasonings to the pea mixture.
stir until well blended. bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring
constantly. When the pate detaches itself from the sides of the pan
remove from the heat. If the pate seems too liquid, just add another
tablespoon of arrowroot, dissolved in a tablespoon of water, to make
the mixture firmer. turn the pate mixture out into a lightly oiled
serving dish and refrigerate. If the mixture becomes firm enough, you
can unmold it onto a plate and garnish with more parsley sprigs.

Variation:

In place of the split peas, use 2 cups of lentils.
Increase the amount of water to about 5 cups. Insert 4 cloves into
the carrot halves. Along with the kombu, carrots, garlic, onion, bay
leaf, and parsley, add the leafy tops from 4 stalks of celery. Cook
these ingredients with the lentils and water for 30 to 35 minutes.
Remove the cloves from the carrots. Then puree the mixture as in the
recipe above.
