Title: Downtown Black Bean Soup
Categories: Vegetable, Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Black beans and 2 bay
-leaves.
2    And 1/2 quarts water or
-vegetable stock and stir
-into it
Bring to a boil

Turn down the heat and let simmer a couple of hours until the beans
start to get tender, then heat 1/4 to 3/4 cup olive oil (how much
will your conscience allow?) and cook in it until tender but not
browned

3 onions, chopped 2 green peppers, chopped 1 fresh jalepeno pepper,
chopped (optional) 4 to 6 cloves of garlic, pressed 1 to 3 teaspoons
salt, maybe more (taste it)

Stir this mixture into the simmering black beans and let cook until
quite tender and flavorful. More salt may be needed, and if you have
a chance to let the soup sit overnight at this point, it will be even
better. If desired, puree half or all of this to smoothness; we like
it half-pureed, half-chunky. If you do puree it, be sure to reheat it
before serving it, either as is or Cuban-style: bowls of steaming hot
white rice and dishes of chopped raw onions are on the table, and
each person stirs as much or as little rice and onions as they wish
into their soup.
