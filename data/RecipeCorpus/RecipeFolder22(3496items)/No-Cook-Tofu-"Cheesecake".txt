* Grape nuts cereal works well in the crust.  Or use a granola-type
cereal from a natural food store, but be sure to choose a variety
that is low in fat.

Crust:  Place cereal or granola in a food processor with a metal
blade. Process until coarsely ground.
Place  ground cereal in a bowl; add apple juice concentrate and mix
well. Press into a 9-inch pie plate. Set aside

Filling:  In a large bowl, mash together tofu and honey. Add vanilla
and cinnamon, if desired.  With electric mixer, beat mixture until
fluffy. Spoon into crust and smooth out the top. Cover loosely with
plastic wrap and refrigerate until serving time.  (The longer the
cheesecake chills, the firmer it will be and the richer it will
taste.)

cheesecake. (Pictured with rasberries arranged on top.) Serves 8 to 10
