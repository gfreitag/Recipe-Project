In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil over medium-high
heat. Stir in the millet, cover, reduce the heat, and simmer until
the water is absorbed, 20 to 30 minutes. (The millet must be freshly
cooked and still warm to form the patties).

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.
Add the celery and onion and cook, until softened, about 6 minutes.
Transfer to a large bowl.

In a food preocessor fitted with the metal blade, combine the bread,
walnuts, parsley, basil, thyme and tamari and process until coarsely
chopped. Add to the onion/celery mixture.

Add the cooked millet to the onion mixture, along with the grated
carrot, and stir to mix.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Lightly oil a baking sheet.

Shape the warm millet mixture into 2-inch patties (about 1/2 cup) to
serve as a main dish or 1-inch patties (about 1/8) cup for an
appetizer. Roll each patty in the Herbed Bread Crumbs, patting to
make the crumbs adhere, and put on the baking sheet. Bake until
lightly browned, 20 to 30 minutes.

Arrange the patties on a serving platter and garnish each one with a
walnut half or a sprig of parsley.
