Title: Melrose Avenue Spring Rolls
Categories: Appetizer, Asian
Yield: 12 servings
1 ts Chinese chili sauce
1/2 ts Sugar
3    Garlic cloves
- finely minced
2 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Cooking oil; PLUS:
3 c  Cooking oil
12    Spring roll skins
2    Eggs; beaten
Dipping sauce of your choice
20    Bibb lettuce leaves
1/2 lb Chorizo sausage
- or any other spicy sausage
1 oz Rice sticks
6    Dried Chinese blk. mushrooms
2 c  Shredded green cabbage
2 c  Bean sprouts
1 c  Julienned carrots
2    Green onions; minced
2 tb Dry sherry
1 tb Oyster sauce
1 tb Oriental sesame oil
ADVANCE PREPARATION: If the sausage is in links, slit the casing and
squeeze the meat out.  Place the sausage meat in a small frying pan
or wok. Cook over low heat until thoroughly cooked and the fat is
rendered, about 15 minutes.  Stir occasionally.  Transfer to a sieve
and press the meat with the back of a spoon to eliminate all fat.  If
the sausage meat is still in lumps, chop finely.

Soak the rice sticks in hot water for 20 minutes.  Drain and cut into
2-inch lengths.  Soak the mushrooms in hot water until soft, about 20
minutes.  Discard the stems and shred the caps.

Combine the sausage, mushrooms, rice sticks, cabbage, bean sprouts,
carrots, and green onions.  Separately combine the sherry, oyster
sauce, sesame oil, chili sauce, sugar, and garlic.  Combine the
cornstarch with an equal amount of cold water and set aside.

Place a 12-inch skillet or wok over high heat.  When hot, add 2
tablespoons cooking oil; when the oil becomes hot, add the sausage
mixture. Stir-fry until the vegetables are brightly colored, about 2
minutes, then add the sauce.  Stir-fry until the vegetables just
begin to wilt, about 1 minute more.  Add a little of the cornstarch
mixture to thicken the sauce, then transfer to a bowl.  Cool to room
temperature, and then place in the freezer until thoroughly chilled,
about 1 hour.

Separate the spring roll skins.  Position each spring roll so one of
the corners is pointing at you.  Place about 1/2 cup of the filling
in the bottom third of the skin and then form the filling into a
cylinder, stretching between the side corners.  Bring the corner
nearest you over the center of the filling and then tuck the tip
under the filling.  Roll the spring roll a turn.  Brush the two side
corners one-third over the top of the cylinder.  Now finish rolling
the spring roll into a cylinder. Place on a small tray as you
complete the rest of the spring rolls. Store, unstacked and
uncovered, in the refrigerator.  (These can be done a day ahead.)

LAST-MINUTE COOKING: Place 3 cups of cooking oil in a 12-inch skillet
and heat over high heat.  When the oil reaches 370 F (bubbles will
escape from the end of a wooden spoon when placed into the oil for 10
seconds), fry the spring rolls in 3 batches, cooking them on both
sides until light golden, about 3 minutes.  Drain on a wire rack.

Heat the oil again, this time until it reaches 400 F.  Fry the spring
rolls a second time in 2 batches until they are dark golden, about 1
minute. Drain.  The second frying makes the spring rolls crispier.

Serve spring rolls whole or cut in half, with one or more dipping
sauce--- TBBS v2.1/NM * Origin: USER SUPPORT, PAOLI PA, 215/251-9387
