Rice: Ignore package directions. Cook in rice cooker same as white
rice. One time I reduced water to cut cooking time close to
directions; it came out tough.

Other: While rice is cooking, saute mushrooms, peppers and carrots for
15-20 minutes. Add garlic and spinach toward the end. If necessary,
deglaze pan with beverage of choice (Seagram's Margarita cooler works
<g>). Add Instant India then cooked rice. Stir-fry for a minute or
two.

Variations: Peppers aren't essential. I happened to have them & they
add color interest. Most people would use half an onion, and maybe
some green onion tops for color. Bean sprouts, tofu and green peas
would be good additions. Soy sauce is traditional. Too salty and
unnecessary -- this rice is plenty brown enough. Instant India was a
stroke of genius. 'Indianized' fried rice is better than oriental.
The trick is don't use so much that it tastes like Curried Rice.
Lacking Instant India you could fake it with curry powder and finely
diced onions.
