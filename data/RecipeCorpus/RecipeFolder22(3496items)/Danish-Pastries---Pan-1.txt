and 25 minutes later) 2. Place dough in greased bowl. Cover. Rest the
dough in fridge for 30 minutes. 3. Roll 5 oz of chilled butter
between two sheets of waxed paper into a 8 x 7 inch rectangle. Place
back in the refrigerator. Chill at least 1 hour. 4. Roll out the
dough on a lightly floured surface into a 10 x 10 1/2 inches
rectangle. 5. Place the rolled out butter over two-thirds of the
dough.  Fold the third without butter over the center third. 6. Fold
the remaining third on top. Seal edges. Rest the dough in the
refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes. 7. Place the dough at right angles

rolling. After the final folding, chill several hours or overnight.
8. Roll out the dough into 10 x 10 1/2 inches. Cut into 6 squares.
