The Chinese rinse rice five or six times to remove excess starch. This
process results in light-textured rice. If not rinsed, rice will
clump and not be as tender.

Place 2 cups long grain white rice in 2-quart saucepan. Add enough
cold water to cover rice. Wash rice by rubbing rice gently between
fingers. Drain. Wash rice 5 or 6 times or until water is clear.
Drain. Add 2 cups cold water and heat to boiling. Cover tightly.
Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes or until liquid is absorbed.
