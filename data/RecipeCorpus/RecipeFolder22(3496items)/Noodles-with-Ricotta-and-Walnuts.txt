This vegetarian dish is rich with walnuts and 2 kinds of cheese. It
makes a wonderful winter pasta.

10 oz whole wheat pasta Salt 1 C ricotta cheese, at room temperature
3-to-4 T soft butter 1 T walnut oil 1/3 C walnuts, finely chopped 1/2
C freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus cheese for garnish 1 C
half-and-half, milk or pasta water 1 T snipped chives 1 T finely
chopped chervil or parsley Freshly ground pepper

BRING LARGE PAN OF WATER to boil for pasta and add salt to taste. If
pasta is dried, add it at this time. If it's fresh, wait until you've
put together sauce ingredients. Have ready heated serving bowl or
plates. Roughly mix ricotta cheese, butter, walnut oil, 1/4 cup
walnuts and grated Parmesan cheese. Thin with half-and-half, stir in
herbs and season with salt and pepper. Transfer mixture to wide
skillet. About the time pasta is done, gently warm sauce over low
flame. Cook and drain pasta and add it directly to pan with ricotta
mixture. Toss everything together well, then place in heated bowl.
Scatter remaining walnuts over pasta and sprinkle with grating of
Parmesan cheese and plenty of ground pepper. Converted by MMCONV
