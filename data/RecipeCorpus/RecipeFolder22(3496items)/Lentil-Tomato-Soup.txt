Title: Lentil Tomato Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetable, Tomato
Yield: 6 servings
4    Carrots, chopped
2    Stalks celery, chopped
A few Baco-bits (optional)
1 c  Tomato paste
2/3 c  Dried lentils, washed and
-picked over
4 c  Water
1    Onion, chopped
A hearty and nutritious soup--high in protein--that does not take
long to make and tastes as though it took all day.

Chopped parsley Garlic Salt and pepper Thyme, dill weed, and tarragon
~ to taste Dry white wine (optional)

Put the first 6 ingredients (lentils, water, onion, carrots, celery,
and Baco-bits if you are using them) into a large pot and simmer
gently for about 3 hours, replenishing the water as needed.  If you
have a taste for it, try adding a little dry white wine.  Then,
tasting to see what quantity is right for you, add very small amounts
of the herbs and spices. Finally, stir in a cup of tomato paste and
let it all heat through.

Makes 6 servings.

MY NOTES:  I never used the Baco-bits or the white wine with this
soup. The lentils do not need to soak.  If you forget and soak them
anyway, just cut the simmering time a little.  Be sure to check the
water level. This becomes a very nice rich, thick stew-like soup, and
can burn quickly. The tomato paste adds a nice tang which benefits
the lentils a lot. If I remember right (it has been six months or so
since I've made this), I am not sure I used all the tomato paste they
call for...  I think I may have just opened a 6-oz. can and put that
in (8 oz. is a cup, so I would be just shy a little).  Don't think it
makes a lot of difference... just add the tomato paste to taste.  ;-)
This is a very pretty soup (lentils being pretty much just brownish,
the carrots and onions and celery bits all some nice color to it, and
the tomato paste makes it have a kind of reddish glow), and is nice
served with a hearty slice of whole grain bread ... especially on a
cold winter night!
