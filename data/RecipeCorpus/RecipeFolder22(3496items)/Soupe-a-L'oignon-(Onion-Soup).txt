-NOT sweet))
2 tb Beef stock base
1/4 ts Powdered mushrooms ((Note:
-We never use this))
9    Large, firm onions
1/2 c  Butter
1 qt Water
1/2 c  White dinner wine ((Note:
Parmesan cheese  ((Note:  We use mozzarella or Swiss))

Peel onions; slice into thin rings (should be about 2 quarts). Saute
onions in butter in a large heavy soup kettle.  When golden but not
browned add water, wine, beef stock base and powdered mushrooms.
Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.  Turn into 8 small, heavy soup
bowls; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.  (If bowls are heavy
and you wish to, soup may be run under the broiler to brown cheese a
little before serving.)

Makes 8 small servings.

NOTE:  We always put a thick slice of French bread on top of soup,
then the cheese (mozzarella or Swiss, generously) on top of that, and
brown under broiler.
