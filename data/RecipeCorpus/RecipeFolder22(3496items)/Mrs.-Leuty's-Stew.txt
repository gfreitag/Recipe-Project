1. Grind ham and chicken, a little at a time, with just enough tomato
juice to keep mixture from clogging blender, or put meats through
medium blade of meat grinder without tomato juice. Set aside.
2. Fry bacon in a large, heavy skillet over low heat until crisp.
Remove bacon, drain, and crumble. Set aside.
3. In bacon fat in skillet, cook onion until soft. Add tomatoes and
ground ham and chicken. Cook until tomatoes are very soft. Stir in
seasonings and crumbled bacon. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Serves 8-10 with barbecued meat; 6 as shortcake.
NOTE: Mrs. Neal Leuty, one of Plains' best cooks, serves this unusual
and unusually good stew in two ways; as an accompaniment to barbecued
fresh pork or chicken along with potato salad, or served with corn
bread squares, split and toasted, as a main course shortcake. Believe
me - and you will when you try it - this is positively scrumptious
served either way.
