Heat oil and fry onion and garlic till soft.  Grind cashews in a nut
mill, blender or mincer then mix with breadcrumbs.  Beat egg well and
add to dry ingredients.  Mix in parsnips (or potatoes) and herbs.
Add fried onion and garlic.  Be sure to scrape in all the juice as
the loaf can get a little dry during baking.  Dissolve the yeast in
stock and add to other ingredients.  Season well.

Melt margarine in skillet and saute the mushrooms till they are soft.
Grease a 2 pound loaf pan then press in half the loaf mixture.  Cover
