Add all ingredients into the pan in the order listed. MB Select white
bread and push "Start." Wonderful for sandwiches or any-meal
accompaniments, this bread can also provide a spectacular
presentation from first- course French onion soup for a haute cuisine
dinner. Spread 1 full-round slice per person with butter (or Kaplan's
Better Than Butter) and dust with grated Parmesan cheese. Cut circles
out of the centers with a coffee can, place outer rings and circles
on a cookie sheet and slide under an oven broiler to brown. To serve:
put one cutout in the bottom of each soup bowl, ladle in hot soup,
then place the crusty outer rings atop the bowls. Shared by Barb Day
