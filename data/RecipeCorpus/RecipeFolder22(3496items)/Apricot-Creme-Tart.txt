mixture, simmering for a couple of minutes. Transfer contents to a
blender or food pocessor. Add tofu, vanilla and lemon juice, and

Melt apricot jam in small saucepan. Brush melted jam on top of tart.
If desired, melt chocolate and drizzle on top in a zigzag fashion.

Chill at least 1 hour before serving. Serves 6 to 8.

Variation: In place of nonstick spray, brush 3 tbs melted margarine
on phyllo leaves.
