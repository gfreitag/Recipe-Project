Render out the diced fatback (you can substitute bacon if you like,
but...) and fry until crisp.  Remove pieces and reserve.  Saute
onions in the grease.  Add the potatoes and coat well.  Add pepper

This is the way they've made it down home for more than 100 years. It
ain't fancy, but oh my is it fine!
