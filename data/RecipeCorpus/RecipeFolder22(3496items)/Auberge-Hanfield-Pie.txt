Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
1 ts Allspice
1/2 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Sea salt
2 c  Soysage
2 c  Tofu, firm or extra firm;
-crushed by hand
Whole wheat pie dough for
-two double crusted pies
1/4 c  Barley malt syrup
2 tb Olive oil
3 c  Potatoes; peeled and finely
-diced
2 c  Onions; peeled and finely
-diced
1 c  Broccoli stems; peeled and
-finely diced
1 ts Minced garlic
1/2 ts Cinnamon
Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Saute th epotatoes, onions,
broccoli and garlic for a few minutes. Add the seasonings and
continue cooking for a few minutes, stirring constantly.Finally, add
the soysage and tofu and cook until the mixture is hot, stirring
constantly.

Roll out half of the dough and prepare the bottom crust for each of
two small pies. Put 3 cups of filling in each pie pan. Roll out the
top crusts and place them over the pies. Seal the edges of the top
and bottom crusts, wetting the edges first with water.
Bake in apreheated oven at 400 degrees for 40 mintues or until th
etop crusts are browned. When the pie has baked for about 30 minutes,
you can glaze the top crust with amixture of 1/4 cup barley malt
syrup and 2 tbs water. Just lightly glaze the crust and return the
pie to the oven. The glaze will make the crust shiny and brown.

Variation:  You may prefer to add a bread crumb topping to the pie
instead of a top crust. Prepare the topping by lightly mixing 1/2 cup
whole wheat bread crumbs and 1/4 cup oil. Sprinkle it over the pie
filling and bake the pie acording to the recipe.
