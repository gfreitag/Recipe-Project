Title: French Market Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 32 servings
2 1/2 tb Dry lentil beans
2 1/2 ts Dry lima beans
1/3 c  Dried black beans
1 1/2 tb Dry mung beans
1 cn Plum tomatoes, diced (28 oz)
2    Yellow onions;medium,chopped
6    Celery;stalks, chopped
2    Garlic;cloves, minced
3 qt Soup Stock
3 tb Dry yellow split peas
1/4 c  Dry black-eyed peas
2 1/2 tb Dry green split peas
1/4 c  Dry pearl barley
2 1/2 tb Dry pinto beans
2 1/2 tb Dry pink beans or small red
2 1/2 tb Dry garbanzo beans
In a stock pot, heat stock just to boiling (do not boil); reduce heat
to simmer. Thoroughly wash peas, barley, and beans; add to stock. Add
tomatoes, onions, celery and garlic; simmer, covered, 3 hours, or
until beans are tender. Makes 32 cups of soup. NOTE: This soup is
sensational and well worth the effort. Finding all these types of
beans may require shopping in more than one supermarket. The dry
beans will keep for months. As a timesaver, measure out the beans for
several recipes and store them in plastic bags. SERVING SUGGESTIONS:
Good with homemade bread !nm fresh seasonal fruit.

SAMMY'S NOTE: I keep a cannister of a mixture of beans that need
soaking and a cannister of legumes, brown rice and barley, that does
not need soaking. I generally substitute whatever is in each
cannister for the above ingredients - I'd suggest 1 cup legumes and
1-1/4 cups beans. The recipe does not mention soaking the beans, but
I would do that.
