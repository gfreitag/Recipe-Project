Categories: Sourdough, Bread
Yield: 2 servings
1 tb Vinegar
1 ts Salt
2 c  Bread flour
1 pk Yeast
2 1/4 c  Warm water
2 tb Sugar
1

Disolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water. Add sugar vinegar,salt,all
purpose flour. Add remaining water until a creamy batter is formed.
Place in a glass bowl,cover and let sit until it starts to ferment.
About 3 days. It will take on a powerful boozy smell. Stir again
until creamy and measure out what is called for in the
recipe.Replenish starter with equal amounts of flour and water. Store
in the fridge and bring to room temp before using. It says to allow
to ferment for one week between uses but I don't.I do let it sit out
overnight after I feed it. This starter took about 1 1/2 months to
become really sour.
