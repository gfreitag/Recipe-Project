Title: Broccoli/mushroom Chowder
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetable
Yield: 8 servings
4 c  Half and half
1 ts Salt (optional)
1/4 ts White pepper
1 ts Tarragon leaves, crushed.
2 lb Fresh broccoli
8 oz Fresh mushrooms
1 c  Butter
1 c  Flour
4 c  Chicken broth
This recipe was submitted to Country Woman by Lorrie Arthur and it is
delicious.

Clean and cut broccoli into 1/2 inch pieces.  Steam in 1/2 cup water
until tender/crisp (I nuke them for 3 to 4 minutes) do not drain.
Set aside. Clean and slice mushrooms.  In a large pan over medium
heat, melt butter; add flour to make a roux.  Cook, stirring
constantly, for 2 to 4 minutes; do not let brown.  Stir in chicken
broth; bring just to a boil. Turn heat to low; add broccoli,
mushrooms, half-and-half and seasonings. Heat through but do not boil.

Makes 8 servings.

NOTE:  This recipe works well cut in half.  Last night I made it using
broccoli and mushrooms that had been taking up space in the reefer for
awhile and were rubbery.  Still tasted great.  I usually serve with
fresh bread (made of course in my bread machine.)
