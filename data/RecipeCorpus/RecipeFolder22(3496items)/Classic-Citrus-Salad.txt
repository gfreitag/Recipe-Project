2 tb Finely sliced red onion
3    Walnut halves, coarsely
Chopped
2 c  Fresh spinach leaves, washed
Dried and chilled
1 sm Orange, peeled and segmented
1.  To make dressing:  In small bowl whisk together dressing
ingredients.

2.  To make salad:  Arrange salad ingredients in serving bowl.

3.  Pour dressing over salad and toss.

DEAL-A-MEAL HELPFUL HINT:  To segment an orange, use a serrated
knife and peel around the orange, removing skin and all white parts.
Insert knife on either side of membranes to remove orange segments.

In a pinch, you could use mandarin oranges canned in their own juice
for this recipe, but a fresh, sweet, juicy orange is much better.
