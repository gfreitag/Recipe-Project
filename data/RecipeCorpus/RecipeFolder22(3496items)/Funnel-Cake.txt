2 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder

Mix the ingredients together: Heat cooking oil in a deep fryer or
skillet until very hot. Put batter into a funnel (be sure to cover
the spout with one finger), then, holding the funnel over the hot oil
( use extreme caution when cooking with hot oil), release some of the
batter in circular motions to form one funnel cake. The funnel cake
will rise quickly and expand, so be careful about how much batter you
use for the first one until you get the "feel" for cooking it. Cook
to a light golden brown on both sides, then remove from the oil and
place on paper towels to drain.. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and
serve while still warm! Mmmm, mmm, good" ** This was in the "Heloise"
