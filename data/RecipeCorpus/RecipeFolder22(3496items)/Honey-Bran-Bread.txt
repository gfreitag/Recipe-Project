Title: Honey-Bran Bread
Categories: Bread
Yield: 1 servings
2 ts Sugar
2 pk Dry yeast
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  Unprocessed coarse bran
4 c  White flour (more if needed)
1 1/2 c  Milk
1/2    Stick unsalted butter (4tb.)
1/3 c  Honey
4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Warm (110 F.) water
In saucepan, combine milk, butter, honey and salt and stir over med.
heat until butter melts.  Remove from heat and let cool to warm.
Meantime, in lge. mixing bowl, combine warm water, yeast and sugar.
Let "work" until foamy, abt. 10 min.  Beat cooled milk mixture into
yeast mixture, then beat in whole wheat flour and bran; beat
thoroughly.  Gradually add all-purpose flour until mixture is too
stiff to beat.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead in remaining
flour or as much as needed until dough is smooth and has a light
sheen.

Note Well:  Properly kneaded dough will NOT stick to surface or hands
or mixing bowl if using machine fitted with dough hook.

Form dough into ball and place in large lightly oiled or greased
bowl, and turn once so greased side is up.  Cover, place in warm,
draft-free place & let rise until doubled in bulk, abt. 1 hr.  Punch
down, and turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead
lightly--just enough to expell any remaining air.  Halve dough, cover
with towell, let rest abt. 10 min.

Form each half of dough into a loaf.  To make pan loaf, roll dough
into rectangle 1/2" thick and abt. as wide as length of pan.  Roll up
jelly roll fashion pinching closed seam as you roll.  Tuck ends under
and place loaf seam side down in greased loaf pan.  Let rise again
until doubled in bulk. Place loaves in center of preheated 425 F.
oven and bake for 15 min. Reduce oven to 350 and continue baking
until loaves shrink slightly from sides of pan, abt. 20 min. or so.
Turn loaves from pan, set on oven shelf an bake 5 min. more or until
a firm rapping on bottom makes  hollow sound. Brush tops with melted
butter and cool on racks.
