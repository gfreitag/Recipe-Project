Title: Miniature Apple Peach Tarts
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
2 lg Peaches
4 T  Peach or apricot jam (sugar
-free)
1 T  Fresh lemon juice
-pinch sugar
-pinch nutmeg
1 c  All-purpose flour
-pinch flour
2 oz Low-fat, small-curd cottage
-cheese
2 oz Unsalted butter
1    -2 TBS ice water
1 lg Green apple
Sift flour with salt 3 times. Cut butter into flour using a pastry
blender, or a food processor, until mixture resembles coarse meal.
Mix in cottage cheese. Add only enough ice water to bind dough. Wrap
dough in plastic wrap and allow to rest for 30 minutes in the
refrigerator. Roll dough into a 3-by-12-inch rectangle. Fold bottom
half of rectangle toward the center and fold the top half over toward
the center, like a letter. Wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Roll
dough out to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out 8- to 10-inch circles, using
a cookie cutter. Place pastry circles on an ungreased baking sheet or
one lined with parchment paper. Chill until firm.

Peel, core and thinly slice the green apple and the peaches. Using a
pastry brush, paint a thin layer of peach glaze (combined jam and
lemon juice) on the pastry circle (leaving a small rim of bare
pastry). Layer apples and peaches on the peach-glazed pastry,
layering up to about 1 1/2 inches high. Sprinkle with a small amount
of sugar and a pinch of nutmeg.

Bake tarts at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes until pastry is crisp and
apples are tender and slightly browned. Brush warm tart with warm
peach glaze if desired. Makes 12-14 servings, depending on size.
