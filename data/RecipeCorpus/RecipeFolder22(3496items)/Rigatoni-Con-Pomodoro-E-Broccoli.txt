Title: Rigatoni Con Pomodoro E Broccoli
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 10 servings
Salt and pepper to taste
Vegetable oil
1 lb Rigatoni; preferably Italian
1 bn Fresh broccoli; cleaned and
-cut into bite-sized pieces
3/8 c  Olive oil
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 bn Whole scallions; thinly
-sliced
3    Ripe tomatoes at room
-temperature; cut into bite-
-sized pieces
5/8 tb Garlic; coarsely chopped
3/8 c  Fresh basil; chopped
1/4 c  Italian parsley; chopped
1 c  Fresh tomatoes; chopped
1/8 c  Olive oil
Boil the broccoli for about 5 mintues, until al dente--do not
overcook. Drain, place in large bowls and allow to cool. Pour 1/2 of
the olive oil over the broccoli and add salt and pepper.

Cook pasta in boiling, salted water, with one tbs of vegetable. oil.
Stir often with a fork or spoon long enough to reach the bottom of
the pot.

When cooked a little firmer than al dente, drain the pasta well and
allow to cool in wide serving bowls.
Pour the rest of the olive oil over the pasta, add salt and pepper
and mix so that it does not stick.

Make the sauce: blend the garlic, basil, parsley, chopped tomatoes
and oils in a food processor. When the pasta and broccoli are cool,
gently mix togehter (it's easier to do with your hands). Add
scallions and mix with the pasta and broccoli. Add the sauce and
gently mix. Add 1/2 cup of parsley and the tomatoes.
Check for salt. Do not refrigerate but serve at room temperature.

The components of this recipe may be made ahead of time--the pasta
cooked in the morning; and dressed just with the olive oil, the sauce
made, and the vegetables prepared. It is best to blanch the broccoli,
however, just a little before mixing together so it keeps its
freshness.
