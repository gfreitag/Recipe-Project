Title: Bean and Tvp Burritos
Categories: Vegetarian, Tex/mexican, Main dish
Yield: 10 servings
2 ts Chili powder
1 ts Cumin
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Oregano
1 tb Olive oil
1 c  Onion, chopped
10 lg (10") tortillas or chapatis
1 c  Dried pinto beans, soaked
Overnight in 3 cups water
1    Bay leaf
3    Cloves garlic, minced
1/2 c  TVP granules or flakes
1/2 c  (less 1 T.) hot water
Drain, rinse and cook the beans until tender (70-90 minutes) in 3
cups of water with the bay leaf and garlic.

Drain the beans, but reserve the liquid in case it is needed later
to thin the filling mixture.

Combine the TVP, hot water, hot bean liquid, chili powder, cumin,
salt and oregano.

Saute the onion in the olive oil in a good sized skilled until
softened.

Add the seasoned TVP and cook a few minutes more. Stir in the cooked
beans, then transfer mixture to a food processor or blender and mash
to a fairly smooth textured filling, adding a little of the bean
liquid if mixture is too thick. Taste and add a little hot sauce if
desired. If done in a blender, you may need to do it in two batches,
then mix the batches together.

To assemble: heat a griddle or skillet until a few drops of water
dance on the surface. Dry fry each tortilla on both sides until the
surface of the tortilla begins to bubble and brown slightly. Keep
them warm in a thick towel. When all are heated, place about 1/3 cup
of filling down one side of a tortilla and roll up. You may wish to
enclose or serve with side dishes of shredded lettuce, grated soy
cheese, salsa sauce or sliced avocados.

Burritos may be made ahead, kept wrapped, and baked before serving.
Unwrap, place on cookie sheet, bursh tops lightly with oil if desired
and bake at 350 degrees about 20 minutes.
