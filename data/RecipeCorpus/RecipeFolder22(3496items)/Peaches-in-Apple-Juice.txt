Title: Peaches in Apple Juice
Categories: Fruit, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 10 servings
3 lb Firm, ripe peaches (about 12    2 1/2 c  Unsweetened apple juice
Wash and drain peaches.  Cut into halves, pit and peel.  Treat to
prevent darkening.  Cook a few peaches at a time in water until
heated through. Drain.  Pack hot into hot jars, leaving 1/2 inch head
space.  Heat apple juice and pour over peaches, leaving 1/2 inch head
space.  Remove air bubbles.  Adjust caps.

Process pints 20 minutes, quarts 25 minutes in boiling water bath.
Yield for original recipe 12 pounds peaches, about 5 quarts.  52
calories per 1/2 cup serving.

MY NOTE:  The original recipe called for 2 1/2 cups apple juice -
should be about 2 1/2 quarts (because 3 pounds of peaches required
about 2 1/2 cups of juice).  I cut the peaches in slices and made 7
half-pint jars. Heated slices of about 4 peaches at a time for 1
minute in the microwave, and heated the apple juice about 3/4 cup at
a time in the microwave in a 2 cup measure.
