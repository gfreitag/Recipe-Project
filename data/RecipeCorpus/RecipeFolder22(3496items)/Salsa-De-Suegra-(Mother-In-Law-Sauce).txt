According to local lore, the cook serves this to her son-in-law
because "le pica mucho" (it bites him a lot). It is very "picante".
However, if you use 3 chiles, it is only pleasantly picante. This
sauce should have a thick, rough consistency and is used with
frijoles, rice, or broiled meats. It is best eaten fresh but will
keep for a few days in the refrigerator without spoiling. It does not
freeze well.

Roughly chop the tomatoes, add a little at a time with the rest of the
ingredients to a blender jar, and blend for a few seconds with each
addition until the sauce has a rough consistency.

the key to salsa verde is the tomatillos (tomate verde -- NOT just a
green tomato)...don't know where you're from, but if it's the west or
southwest, you'll probably find them in the super...if not, they are
available canned, in a mexican food section.
