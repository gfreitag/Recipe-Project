Zydeco Green Beans is actually a redundancy.  The exuberant music of
Louisiana's black French-speaking Creoles is called zydeco, an
idiomatic phonetic version of les haricots, French for snap beans.
Serve these green beans as a relish, or as "stirrers" for Bloody
Marys.

~-- In a large saucepan, stir together the water, vinegar, sugar,
mustard seeds, garlic, bay leaves, salt and Tabasco sauce.  Bring to
a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add the
beans.  Cover and simmer for 10 minutes, until tender-crisp.  Arrange
the beans in a shallow dish and cover them completely with the
vinegar mixture.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.  Serve cold.
