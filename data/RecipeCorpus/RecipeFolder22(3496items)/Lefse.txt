Title: Lefse
Categories: Bread, Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Lard
4 c  Flour
2 c  Milk, scalded
1 tb Salt
Add lard, salt and 2 cups flour to scalded milk and mix well over low
heat. Remove from fire.  Sift 2 cups of flour on board, add warm
dough and work in flour.  Knead well and cool. This dough can be
rolled immediately or kept in a cool place for a couple of days. May
be stored in a plastic bag. Make a small patty, about hamburger size,
with even sealed edges as you would for pastry.  Flour board lightly
and with a Scandinavian rolling pin roll patty in all directions,
keeping the dough round. Roll lightly, stretching dough until it is
almost as large as the lefse baker. Use pointed stick to handle dough
when it is transferred from the board to the baker.  Brown lightly,
prick air bubbles, turn and brown other side. It may be necessary to
change heat control from high to low. This is a soft bread. Serve
with butter, or butter and sugar. (Note: I don't have either a
Scandinavian rolling pin or a lefse baker, so I use a regular rolling
pin and a griddle.  This is like a Swedish tortilla! We usually
spread butter and sprinkled sugar over the lefse then rolled them up
and DEVOURED them!)
