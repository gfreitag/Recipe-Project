ANZAC day is celebrated in Australia on April 25.  On this day in
1915, the ANZACs (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) landed at
Gallipoli, and suffered the worst defeat in Australian military
history.  The fallen soldiers of all wars are now commemorated on
ANZAC day.  Another cookbook stated that these cookies were sold to
raise money to help returned veterans.

In saucepan place butter, treacle, soda, sugar and mix with boiling
water. Bring slowly to boil, remove and add dry ingredients.  Mix
well.  Place spoonfuls about 3 inches apart on well greased cookie
tray.  Bake at 275F about 25 min.
