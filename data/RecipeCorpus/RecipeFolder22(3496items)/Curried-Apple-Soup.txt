Title: Curried Apple Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Salt
2/3 c  Apple Juice
1 1/4 c  Whipping Cream
Ground Ginger
2 lg Cooking Apples
Lemon Juice
2 ts Curry Powder
3 tb Butter Or Vegetable Oil
5 c  Chicken Stock
Servings:  6 Cooking Time: 30 Minutes

Peel and core the apples, keeping a few curls of peel for a garnish.

Mince this peel and keep it in water with a little lemon juice until
needed.  Fry the curry powder in the butter until dark brown.  Stir in
about a quarter of the stock and cook until the mixture is smooth.
Add the rest of the stock and the salt.  Mince the apples and drop
immediately into the stock in order that they do not discolor in the
air.  Cover and allow to simmer, gently, for 20 minutes or until the
apples are soft.  Add the apple juice and blend well.  Chill the soup
for several hours, or until needed.  Add the chilled cream just
before serving.  Sprinkle a little ginger on top when you serve and
garnish with the minced apple peel, if desired.
