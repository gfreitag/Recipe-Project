~-- One to Three Days In Advance: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Butter bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan. Line bottom with
parchment or waxed paper.  Using heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap foil
under and up outside of spring form pan to prevent leaks; set aside.
In 3-qt saucepan, combine cut-up chocolate and butter.  Cook over low
heat, stirring often, until chocolate and butter melt and mixture is
smooth. Remove from heat; cool 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, with whisk,
beat eggs and sugar over hot, but not boiling, water, until eggs are
lukewarm and foamy and sugar is dissolved. Transfer to large bowl.
Beat egg mixture at high speed until very thick and pale
yellow--about 8 minutes. Beat in flour. Spoon about one fourth egg
mixture into cooled chocolate. Fold chocolate back into remaining egg
mixture.  Pour into prepared pan. Place pan in deep roasting pan.
Fill with enough hot water to come 2/3rds of the way up the side of
springform pan. Bake 15 minutes (mixture will still be soft in
center). Place cake on wire rack; remove foil; carefully loosen edge
of cake with a sharp knife or metal spatula.  DO NOT remove side of
springform pan. Cool at room temperature 1 hour.  Refrigerate
overnight or up to 3 days. On day of serving prepare glaze: In small
saucepan, combine heavy cream and chocolate.  Cook over low heat,
stirring often, until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Chill
until thick enough to spread but still pourable--20 minutes. Loosen
cake and remove sides of springform pan. Invert cake onto serving
plate. Carefully remove bottom of springform pan and parchment paper.
Spread some of the glaze on side of cake. Pour remaining glaze on
top, spreading with a spatula to form a smooth surface. Let cake
stand at room temperature about 30 minutes to set glaze before
decorating with white candy roses.
