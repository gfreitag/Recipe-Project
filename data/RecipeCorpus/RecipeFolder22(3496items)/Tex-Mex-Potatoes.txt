Title: Tex Mex Potatoes
Categories: Vegetarian, Tex/mexican
Yield: 4 servings
1 T  Chopped cilantro
1/2 t  Chili powder
1/2 t  Ground cumin
1    Tomato chopped
1/4 c  Frozen corn kernals thawed
2    Scallions, chopped
1 T  Cilantro chopped
6    Firm red or white potatoes
2 c  Mashed pinto beans
1 c  Salsa
1    (4 oz) can diced green
-chilis
1 sm Round onion chopped
1    Clove garlic, crushed
Preheat oven to 375

Scrub potatoes and cut lengthwise into wedges. Place on baking sheet,
cut side up. BAke until lightly browned, about 40 min.

Meanwhile combine beans, salsa, chilis, onion, garlic, cilantro, chili
powder, and cumin in a saucepan. Heat over very low heat for about 15
min.

Combine corn, tomato, scallions and cilantro. Set aside.

Place potato wedges on a large serving platter. Scoop bean mixture
over the potatoes. Finish (whatever that means) with the tomato-corn
mixture. (I guess that means put it on the top).

I don't know why I havent tried this one yet, it sure sounds good as I
type. Hope you enjoy it.
