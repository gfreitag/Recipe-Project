Title: Fish Soup with Fennel
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1    Small onion
1    Carrot
1    Leek
1/2 lb Hake
2 tb Butter
1 tb Flour
2 tb Sour cream
2 tb Chopped fennel leaves
1 lb Flounder
Bones from fish
1    Bay leaf
4    Parsley stalks
2    Lovage stalks
6 1/4 c  Cold water
Sea salt
6    Black peppercorns
Put the fish bones in a pan with the bay leaf, parsley, and lovage.
Cover with cold water, add salt and peppercorns, and bring to boil.
Simmer for 30 minutes.  Peel and chop the onion and carrot.  Trim and
chop the leek. Put them in a saucepan.  Pour the fish stock over the
vegetables through a seive (strainer).  Bring to a boil, then let
simmer for another 30 minutes, then put in the hake.  Simmer for 15
minutes, or until the hake is cooked. Remove the hake and put the
plaice (flounder) filets into the pan. Simmer for 5 minutes, then
remove them.  Cool the soup slightly, then puree it in a blender.
Melt the butter in a clean pan, stir in the flour and cook for one
minute.  Stir in the blended soup and simmer for 3 minutes, stirring.
Add salt and pepper to taste.  Take the hake off the bone and chop
it; skin the plaice (flounder) filets and chop them.  Put both sorts
of fish into the soup and stir in the sour cream.  When all is hot,
add the chopped fennel and stand, covered, for 3 to 4 minutes before
serving. Serve as is, or with fennel dumplings.
