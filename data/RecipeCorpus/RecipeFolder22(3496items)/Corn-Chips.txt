Title: Corn Chips
Categories: Bread, Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Masa harina, or as needed
Corn oil for frying
1 c  Warm (100 F.) water
1    Egg yolk
1 ts Salt
In a mixing bowl, whisk the water, egg yolk and salt together until
thoroughly mixed. Gradually add enough masa to make a soft dough, just
stiff enough not to stick to your fingers.

In a heavy skillet, deep fryer, or elec. skillet preheat oil to at
least 375 F.

Fit a cookie press or pastry bag with the plate or tip designed to
make a flat, ribbed shape and fill it with the masa dough.  Press out
into the hot oil a few short lengths of dough, enough to cover only
about half the surface of the oil.  Fry ribbons turning once, just
until golden brown. Remove with slotted spoon or skimmer and drain on
paper towels.

Serve chips while still warm, or cool completely and store airtight.
To serve chips after storage, freshen briefly in warm oven.  Will
keep for up to one week.

Masa flour, made from specially processed corn, has a taste all its
own. Cornmeal CANNOT be substituted.  Chips can be made in double or
triple batches and are so quick they can be made on very short notice.
