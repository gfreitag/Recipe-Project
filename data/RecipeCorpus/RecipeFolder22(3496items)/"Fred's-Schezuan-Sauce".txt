Well, this is NOT non-fat, but is low fat. It's kind of a Schezuan
sauce I guess, of my own invention. If I could figure out how to
avoid using the oil it would be non-fat, but anything I've tried has
been less than yummy. Considering it makes about 1 1/2 cups of sauce,
and that goes a long way (ie: 2 Tbs per serving, approx), the fat
content per serving should be about 1g due to the sauce.  The flavor
of the sesame oil is quite indespensible, to me.

It's quite spicy, be warned! But it's fantastic for vegetables over
rice, or with vegetables, grilled chicken, and rice noodles; or
stirred into plain wild rice. Experiment!

DIRECTIONS: =========== In a small skillet, saute the garlic, hot
pepper, shallot, and mustard seed in the oil until the garlic and
shallots brown and the mustard seeds begin to pop (best over high
heat, but don't let the oil burn).  Add the tomato juice, tamari,
white pepper and cumin. Lower heat and simmer 5 mins. In a smal cup
mix 2 tsp cold water and the arrowroot until smooth. Stir into sauce,
stirring constantly. The sauce should thicken in about a minute or
two. Remove from heat and stir into your favorite dish.
