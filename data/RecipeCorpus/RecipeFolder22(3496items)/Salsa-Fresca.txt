Title: Salsa Fresca
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Tex/mexican
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Ice Water
Salt
1 ts Crushed Oregano Leaves
1 lb Ripe Tomatoes
1/4 c  Chopped Scallions
2 md Finely Chopped Jalapenos
1 tb Fresh Lime Juice
Chop the tomatoes and add to the onions and jalapenos in a medium
sized bowl.  Add the remaining ingredients and mix by hand, bruising
the tomato pieces.  Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.  Serve
at once as this salsa doesn't keep well.  The difference between this
salsa and Pico De Gallo is that this recipe calls for oregano and
Pice De Gallo calls for cilantro.
