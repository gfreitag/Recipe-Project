1/2 ts Dill
Oil to saute
1 pk Lipton Golden Onion Soup Mix
4    Smoked pork chops, lean
1    Egg, beaten
3/4 c  Seasoned bread crumbs
1 ts Garlic powder
1. Heat the oil in a frying pan, preferably cast iron. Heat the oven
to 300F. In a separate disk, add the beaten egg, and add a little
milk to extend. In another dish, place the bread crumbs, garlic and
dill.

2. Dip the chops in the egg, then dredge through the crumb/spice
mixture. Saute in hot oil on both sides until brown.

3. Transfer to a large baking dish (which you should spray with a
nonstick spray to make life easier when you clean it!). Sprinkle with
the Golden Onion Soup mix and bake at 300F for 1 1/2 hours, covered.

4. About 30 minutes before the meat is done, prepare Minute Rice
according to instruction in a separate saucepan. Instead of using the
water as directed, try using College Inn or Swanson Beef Broth (it
gives the rice a GREAT flavor!). Once the rice is prepared, (it
should take about 10 minutes), remove the meat from the oven, remove
the chops from the baking pan, put the rice in the bottom of the
baking dish, and put the chops back ontop of the rice. Bake uncovered
for an additional 10 minutes at 400F.

This is great with a vegetable and rolls. Don't forget the
applesauce! Very filling.
