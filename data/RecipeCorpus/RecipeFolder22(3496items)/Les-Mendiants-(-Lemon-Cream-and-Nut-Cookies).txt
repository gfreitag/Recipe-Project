The colors the fruits used in the cookies suggest those of the robes
fromn by the four ordres mendiants, monastic orders that originally
lived on charity -- the Augustinians, Carmelites, Dominicans and
Franciscans.

Torte Pastry:  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle,
cream together butter and sugar until light.  In a small bowl, whisk
1 egg. Pour 1/2 of the whisked egg into butter and sugar mixture,
reserving the remaining half for another use.  Add the remaining
whole egg and blend mixture well.  Remove paddle and replace with a
dough hook.  Add flour, mixing thoroughly.  Form dough into a ball,
wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate 2 hours.

Roll dough out to a thickness of slightly more than 1/8 inch.  Cut
dough into 35 1 1/2-inch ovals with pointed ends and place on
ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake in a preheated 350F oven 15 to 20
minutes, or until cookies are a light caramel color.

Lemon Cream: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat combine eggs,
sugar, butter, lemon juice and lemon zest.  Bring mixture to a boil,
stirring continually with a wooden spoon.  Boil gently for 30
seconds. Transfer mixture to a bowl, cover and chill thoroughly.

Assemble: Spread each cookie with 1 heaping tablespoon of lemon cream
and top with 2 prunes halves, 2 almonds, 2 hazelnuts, 2 walnut
halves, 7 raisins and 2 pieces candied orange peel. Makes
approximately 35 cookies.
