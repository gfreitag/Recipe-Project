Title: Paprikosh
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
2 lg Onions (sliced thin)
3 T  Paprika*
-salt & pepper to taste
5 lg Carrots (cubed)
8 lg Potatoes (cubed)
5 lg Celery stalks
Throw all ingredients into the crockpot, add water to top veggies (it
makes a sort of "gravy") and cook on high for 4 hours.

Note: *I use quite a bit more paprika than this, but you know your own
taste. Shared by taylorn@kenyon.edu
