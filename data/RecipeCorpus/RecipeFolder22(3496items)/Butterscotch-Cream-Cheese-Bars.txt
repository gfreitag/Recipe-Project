Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 6 dozen bars
1/2 c  Sugar
4    Eggs
1/4 c  Flour
2 tb Lemon juice
1 pk 12 oz Butterscotch Chips
6 tb Butter
2 c  Graham cracker crumbs
1 c  Finely chopped walnuts
2 pk 8 oz each cream cheese, soft
1. In a small heavy saucepan over low heat (or in a microwave oven in
a microwave safe bowl or saucepan for 4 minutes on 70% power), melt
the butterscotch chips and butter, stirring until smooth. If you use a
microwave safe saucepan or bowl, be sure to cover it.

2. Transfer to large bowl. With a fork, stir in the graham cracker
crumbs and walnuts until the mixture resembles crumbs; reserve 2 cups

and bake in preheated 350F oven for 12 minutes.

3. In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until fluffy.
Slowly add one egg at a time, beating after each addition. Add flour
and lemon juice, and beat until smooth.

4. Pour over hot baked crust, and sprinkle with reserved crumbs. Bake
at 350F for 25 minutes. Cool completely in pan on wire rack. Cut into
2 x 1 inch bars. Chill before serving.
