*the needler* Notes: I used 1 cup of cream style corn,
that is what is in those little cans and I used one with no salt. I
thought it was a bit oily for my taste, so next time I would use less
oil maybe about a half cup. I used 3 heaping tablespoons of Ortego
hot chopped Jalopenos...I would use more next time..it was ok but I
like it hotter. It was fine for those who dont like it really hot.
