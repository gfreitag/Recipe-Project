Title: Khatta Moong - Soured Lentils
Categories: Indian, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
1    1/2-inch Ginger
2 ts Ghee
1    1-inch Stick of Cinnamon
1/2 ts Cumin Seeds
1 pn Of Asafetida (optional)
1/2 ts Sugar
2 tb Chopped Coriander Leaves
2/3 c  Plain Yoghurt
2/3 c  Whole Moong Dal (Mung Beans)
3 c  Water
1/2 ts Ground Turmeric
1 ts Salt
3 3/4 c  Water
2 tb Gram (Chickpea) Flour
4    Green Chilis
Let the Yoghurt sit 24 hours at room temperature so that it has a
slightly sour taste. Wash the Dal thoroughly. Place the Dal, 3 Cups
Water, a pinch of Turmeric and 1/2 Tsp of Salt in a saucepan and
bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover loosely, and simmer until the
Dal has split open but is still whole. (It should not become mushy.)
Drain and put aside. Whisk together the Yoghurt, 3 3/4 Cups Water and
Gram Flour. [This seems like a lot of water to me, It's been quite a
while since I made this, but I believe I had to cut down on the water
to get a good consistency. One can always add water later to thin
things, but it is more difficult to get rid of an excess.] Grind two
of the Chilis and the Ginger to a paste Heat the Ghee in a large
saucepan. Add the remaining two Chilis, broken in half, Cinnamon,
Cumin, and Asafetida and let them sizzle for 5-6 seconds. Add the
Yoghurt mixture, the remaining Turmeric and Salt, Sugar and the Chili
and Ginger paste. Stirring constantly, cook for 5-7 minutes. Add the
drained Dal and cook for a further 5 minutes until thick. Garnish
with the Coriander Leaves
