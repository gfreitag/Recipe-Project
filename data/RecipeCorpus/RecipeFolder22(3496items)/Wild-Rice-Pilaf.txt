minutes.

and saute until the onion is golden.
Add the apple and saute another 5 minutes. Stir in the cooked rice
mixture along with the juice, scallions, currants and spices. Season

Saute over low heat, stirring frequently, another 5 minutes. This

off the heat until needed. Just before serving, heat through, adding
a bit more liquid if the mixture needs it, then stir in the parsley
and pecans. Mound in the center of a large serving platter and
surround with leek and corn stuffed peppers.
