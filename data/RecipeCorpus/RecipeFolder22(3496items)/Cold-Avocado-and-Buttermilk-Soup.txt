Title: Cold Avocado and Buttermilk Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
-(optional)
1 pn Of sugar (optional)
Salt to taste
2    Jalapeno peppers, seeds and
-veins removed, diced
3    To 5 tablespoons minced
-cilantro
1/3 c  Coarsely chopped sweet
-onion, such as Vidalia
2 1/2 c  Cold chicken broth, all fat
-removed
3    Thoroughly ripe avocados
1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
1    Drop almond extract
Crisp tortilla chips to accompany

Place the onions in a blender or processor and add 1 cup of the Puree
as fine as possible. Peel and chunk in 2 1/2 of the avocados,
reserving the remaining half for garnish. Puree again, adding broth
as necessary.

Transfer the soup to a large bowl. Add any remaining broth the
buttermilk to the blender and whir briefly to pick as much avocado as
possible. Add to the soup, along with the extract and sugar, if
desired. Both of these rather surprising ingredients enhance avocado
when used in tiny amounts. Stir well, taste and adjust the salt. The
soup may be made to this in advance and refrigerated several hours,
but for best flavor allow it to warm up a bit before serving. It
should be cold but not icy.

Peel the remaining half avocado cut into very thin slices. Divide
soup-among six serving bowls and top with the sliced avocado, and
coriander. Serve accompanied by the tortilla chips.
