Garlic bread
Parmesan cheese; grated
5    To 6 c good chicken broth
4    Eggs
Heat the broth to simmering. Pour enough of it into a large skillet
to make a depth of about 1" and bring to simmer. Break the eggs 1 by
1 in a saucer and slide them into the skillet. Simmer for 4 to 5
minutes or until done to your liking. Remove the eggs to soup bowls
with a slotted spoon and fill the bowls with the rest of the broth.
Serve sprinkled with Parmesan cheese to taste and pieces of garlic
bread. Source: Times-Picayune, N.O.LA
