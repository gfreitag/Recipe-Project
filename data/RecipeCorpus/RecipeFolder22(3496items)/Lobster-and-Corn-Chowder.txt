Title: Lobster and Corn Chowder
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
1 qt Half-and-half
4 tb Butter
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly-ground black pepper
1    Lobster (about 1 1/2 Lb)
2 md Ptoatoes
1 md Onion
4    Ears fresh corn (OR 2 cups
-frozen corn kernels)
PREPARATION:  Bring 4 quarts of water to boil in a 6- to 8-quart soup
kettle.  Add lobster , cover and boil for about 10 minutes.  Remove
and reserve the shells and carcass for stock.  Cut lobster meat into
2-inch pieces.  (Can wrap and refrigerate meat and shell overnight.)
Peel and cut potatoes into 1/2-inch dice.  Mince the onion (1 cup).
Remove the corn kernels from the cobs (or drain and set aside thawed
corn).

COOKING AND SERVING:  Put the reserved lobster shells and carcass in a
large saucepan with the half-and-half.  Bring to a boil, lower heat,
and simmer 4 minutes.  Remove from heat and set aside.  Melt the
butter in a soup kettle.  Add the potatoes, onion and corn kernels
and saute over medium-low heat until the onion is translucent, about
5 minutes. Strain the lobster cream over the vegetables, bring to a
simmer, and then simmer slowly until the potatoes are tender, 6 to 8
minutes.  Stir in the lobster meat, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper.
Simmer just until the lobster meat is hot, about 5 minutes.  Ladle
into warm bowls and serve with Corn Crisps.
