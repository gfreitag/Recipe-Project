Title: Smashed Radishes in Soy Dressing
Categories: Asian, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Peanut oil
1 ts Sesame oil
1/4 ts Fresh ginger juice
Chinese parsley garnish
2    Dozen fresh red radishes
2 ts Salt
1 ts White vinegar
1 ts Sugar
3 ts Thin soy sause
Remove heads and tails from radishes; wash.  Using bottom of heavy
drinking glass, about 2" across base, hit radishes on side to crack
them - not mash them - so dressing can get into flesh.  Avoid
rendering a crushing blow no matter how you feel that day.  Sprinkle
radishes all over with salt, put them in a bowl, and set aside for
about 15 minutes at room temperature.

Prepare dressing:  Combine vinegar, sugar, thin soy sauce, peanut oil,
sesame oil and fresh ginger juice.  Double amount of vinegar for a
sharper taste, if desired.  Drain liquid from radishes (salt will
have drawn off quite a bit of water); pour dressing over them; cover
and refrigerate for 30 minutes. If you make this dish ahead of time,
pour on dressing 30 minutes before serving. Immediately before
serving, transfer radishes to serving dish; garnish with Chinese
parsley and serve.
