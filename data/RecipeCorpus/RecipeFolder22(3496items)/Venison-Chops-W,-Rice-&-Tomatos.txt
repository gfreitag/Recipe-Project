Title: Venison Chops W/ Rice & Tomatos
Categories: Game, Meat, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
Salt & pepper to taste
Clove garlic; minced
1 c  Sauterne wine
1 ts Angostura bitters
2 c  Water
1    Lemon (juice only)
6    1-inch venison chops
1 md Onion; sliced
2 c  Cooked white rice
1 lg Fresh tomato
1 lg Green Bell pepper
2    #3 cans tomatos
Mix the wine, water, & lemon juice together. Pour over the chops,
cover, & marinate in the fridge for 4-8 hours. Brown the chops in a
large skillet after seasoning with the salt & pepper.

Place each chop on the bottom of a large baking dish. Cut the green
pepper into 1/4" thick rings. Place on top of each chop. Put a scoop
of rice in each ring. Top with a slice of onion and top each with a
slice of tomato. Dump the canned tomatos into a bowl and chop them
into small chunks. Add the bitters & garlic and season with salt &
pepper. Pour these around the chops. Cover & steam for 1 hour in 375
degree F oven.

Venison chops, or any others for that matter, are excellent when
fixed this way. It is another Cajun recipe that I have had passed to
me by relatives from Louisiana. Enjoy-
