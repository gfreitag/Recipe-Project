Title: Lime-Pine Marmalade
Categories: Fruit
Yield: 7 servings
Approximately 5 cups sugar
-(2 1/2 pounds)
2 tb Freshly grated orange rind
1    Grapefruit
2    Limes
1 lg Pineapple
Approximately 5 cups water
Makes about 7 half-pints. Wash and remove the seeds of the limes and
the grapefruit and dice or put them through a meat grinder. Pare,
core and chop the pineapple. Measure all the fruit including the
juice, and add 1 1/2 cups of water for each cup of fruit; let this
stand overnight. The next morning, simmer the fruit and water,
uncovered, over low heat until the fruit is tender, about 1 hour.
Measure the mixture again and add the orange rind and 1 cup of sugar
for each cup of pulp. Cook over medium heat until sugar has
dissolved, stirring constantly. Then cook over high heat until your
jelly thermometer reads 220 - 222 F, or the syrup sheets (2 drops
falling from the side of a spoon and forming 1 large drop). Ladle
into hot, sterilized jars and seal immediately.

To seal:  Fill to within 1/2-inch head room, being sure to first wipe
the rim and threads of the jars with a hot damp cloth to remove all
particles of food, seeds or spices.  While contents are hot, cover
with a 1/8-inch layer of paraffin.  When paraffin has set, add
another layer of melted paraffin, tilting and rotating the jar to
seal completely.
