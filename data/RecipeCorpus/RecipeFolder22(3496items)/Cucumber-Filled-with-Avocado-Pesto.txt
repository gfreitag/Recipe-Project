If you have a hot-house cucumber, simply wash & dry it. If you don't,
remove strips of peel, lengthwise, leaving thin strips of peel in
place. The cucumber will look white with thin green stripes. Cut the
cucumber in half, lengthwise.  With an apple corer or teaspoon,
remove the seeds by cutting a channel in the cucumber lengthwise down
the center of both halves, three quarters of an inch wide and equally
deep. Discard seeds.

Crush the garlic.  Pulverize the pine nuts in a blender, mini-food
processor, or motar and pestle.  In a small bowl, mix the garlic, pine
nuts, basil leaves, and salt.

Mash the avocado with a fork and pass through a sieve to pur e. Add
the lemon juice and garlic-pine nut paste and mix well.

Fill the channels evenly with the pesto.  Garnish with olive slices
and a single line of pimentos running down the center of each channel.

Chill, cut into 1/3-inch pieces, and serve.
