Title: George Fassett's Meat Marinade
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 2 servings
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1 tb Parsley flakes
Oregano
1 c  Oil
1/3 c  Vinegar
4    Eggs
1 tb Bell's seasoning
Add ingredients to a bowl with a lock top. Add one piece of meat at a
time (either chicken, pork, beef or venison) and shake vigor- ously
to mix ingredients. Then add the rest of the meat and let marinate
overnight in the refrigerator.

If you charcoal the meat over a grill or open fire, baste with the
marinade each time you turn, and the meat will form a marinade crust.
It's great.
