1 1/4 c  Flour (white, with a little
--whole wheat)
5 tb Cold water
1/2 c  Nuts (of choice); finely
--minced.
ds Salt
4 tb Margarine, cut into small
Place nuts, margarine, salt and flour together in a bowl. Use a
pastry cutter to work the mixture until it is uniform and resembles
coarse corn meal.

Gradually drizzle in the cold water, and graduate from pastry cutter
