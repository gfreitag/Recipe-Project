2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
1 ts Fine sea salt
1/2 c  ;water, lukewarm
2 1/2 ts Active dry yeast (1 pkg)
1 ts Pure maple syrup
1 c  ;water
In a small bowl, combine the lukewarm water, eyast and maple syrup;
let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
Stir in the 1 cup water and the olive oil.

In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, white flour and
salt. Add the yeast mixture and stir until well mixed. Turn the dough
out onto a floured work surface.

Lightly flour your hands, and shape the dough into a ball. Knead the
dough until it is smooth and elastic, 10 to 15 minutes. (To knead,
pick up the far edge of the dough, fold it oer in half, and press
down the center of the dough with the heels of your hands. Turn the
dough a quarter turn, and repeat.) Add more flour to the work surface
as needed, to keep the dough from sticking.

Shape the dough into a ball, put into alightly oiled bowl and turn
once to coat it. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth, put it in a warm
place, and let the dough rise until it is doubled in size, about 1
hour.

Lightly oil a 24-inch pizza pan and dust it with cornmeal.

Punch thedough down 6 to 8 times by pushing your fist into the
center of the dough. Shape the dough into a ball.

Lightly flour a rolling pin. Ona floured work surface, roll out the
dough to a 16-inch circle. Transfer the dough to the pizza pan. Fold
the excess dough over, andpinch to form a thick rim of dough.
