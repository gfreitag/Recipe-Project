Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup warm water and honey, and let stand a
few minutes. Add 1 cup of warm water and 1 tbs olive oil. Stir in the
flour.

Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead for 5 minutes or
more until smooth, adding more flour if needed. Cover and let rise
for an hour.

For the filling:

Mix the boiling water and TVP. Let it stand while you prepare the
vegetables.

Heat a non-stick skillet and add 2 tsp olive oil.
Saute the onons, pepper and garlic a few minutes to soften, then
remove to a bowl.

Heat the pan again and add 1 Tbsp olive oil. Saute the reconstituted
TVP a minute or two, sprinkling with the spices. Cook a few minutes
and add the tomato or tomato sauce.

Punch down the risen dough and divide into 2 balls.
Have 2 lightly oiled baking dishes ready. On a lightly floured
surface, roll a ball of dough out into a long oblong, about 5 inches
wide. Spread half the filling down the long side of the dough,
leaving edges bare.
Roll dough over to seal filling in, pinching edges.
Cut each roll of dough into 10 pieces, placing slices on baking
sheets, seam side down. Let rise again for 20 minutes. Heat oven to
375 degrees, and bake for 20-25 minutes until lightly browned. Cool
on a rack.
