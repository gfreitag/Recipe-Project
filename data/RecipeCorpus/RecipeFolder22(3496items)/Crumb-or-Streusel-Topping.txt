To quote the author, "If you use pat-in pastry to make a pie, you
won't have a top crust. A crumb topping is a great substitute. Golden
and crumbly, it looks irresistible, has a warm, buttery flavour, and
is easy to make. It can used to make with any fruit pie and some
others as well."

Blend the sugar, flour and butter until crumbly, then add nuts.
Sprinkle evenly over pie filling in the pie shell and bake as your
recipe directs. If the crust topping starts browning before the
filling is baked, put a piece of foil over it.
