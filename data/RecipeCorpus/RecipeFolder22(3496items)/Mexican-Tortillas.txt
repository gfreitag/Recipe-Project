Title: Mexican Tortillas
Categories: Tex/mexican, Bread
Yield: 4 servings
25 g  Lard or margarine
300 ml Warm water
225 g  Polenta (Maize Meal)
1 ts Salt
225 g  Plain white flour
Mix the maize meal, salt and white flour in a large bowl, add the
lard or margarine and rub in until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
Add the water and mix to a dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly
floured surface and knead for a short time until smooth. Shape the
dough into 4 equal balls, roughly the size of a tennis ball, and let
them rest for about an hour covered with a damp tea towel. Roll each
ball out thinly on the floured surface to a circle about 25cm (10
inch) in diameter.

Heat an ungreased griddle or large frying pan and fry the maize meal
pancakes over a fairly high heat, turning them over so they are
lightly brown on each side.

Variations.

The tortilla is a multi-purpose bread and can be served as it is, a
thin, flat cornbread to accompany food. It can also be used as a
platter or scoop for thick meat or bean mixtures. It can be fried on
one side only and rolled round a chilli-and-bean stuffing to become a
Taco, or stuffed, sometimes fried and coated in sauce when it is
known as an Enchillada. Finally, it can be sprinkled with sweet
mixtures and served as a pudding.
