Yield: 8 servings
1    7" strip kombu

1 c  Miso sauce
2 1/2 lb Seitan, uncooked
8 c  Water
1 1/2 c  Tamari

MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
Preheat the oven to 375 F.

Place seitan in an 8" square cake pan. Allow to rest until it spreads
to fill the pan. Place pan inside a second, larger pan. Bake for one
hour.

Divide seitan into 8 equal pieces.

In a large saucepan, combine water, tamari, kombu, ginger and seitan.
Cover and simmer for about 45 minutes. (If using a pressure cooker,
reduce liquid by 1/2 and cook for 20 to 25 minutes.) You may leave
the seitan in the stock for several hours for added flavor, if you
wish.

Remove seitan from stock and drain. Brush with a little Miso Sauce,
and broil until lightly browned.

Serve hot with additional sauce.

Miso sauce:

Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. If sauce
begins to separate, add more tofu.

Pour sauce into a saucepan and simmer gently for 5 minutes or until
heated through.
