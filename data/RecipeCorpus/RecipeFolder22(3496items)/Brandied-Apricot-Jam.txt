Categories: Can/preserv

2 c  Dried apricot halves, halved    1 1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Almond extract
3 tb Brandy or Congac
2 1/2 c  Water
Juice and grated peel of>>>>
1    Orange
1) Combine apricots and water in a bowl, cover, and let stand
overnight, or until soft and well plumped--abt 12 hrs. 2) Combine
apricots and their soaking water in saucepan with the orange peel and
juice and simmer for 5 min. 3) Add the sugar and bring to boil,
stirring. Boil gently, stirring often, until the mixture is thick and
shiny anb begins to clear the sides of the pan when stirred. While
mixture thickens, be sure to stir it continually but gently, so that
the fruit does not burn or get squashed. DO NOT ALLOW THE MIXTURE TO
COOK DOWN TO A PUREE; it should retain good-sized bits of apricot.
This step will take abt. 30 min., but will vary. 4) Remove the
preserve from heat and stir in almond extract and brandy. 5) Ladle
into 3 half-pint canning jars, prepared in usual manner and seal with
sterilized 2 pc. screw-on lids. 6) Cool and let mellow several weeks
or more before serving.
