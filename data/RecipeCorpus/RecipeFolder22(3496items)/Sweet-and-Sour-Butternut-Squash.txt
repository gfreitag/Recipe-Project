Stan Frankenthaler, is a chef at Caffe Gianni, in downtown Boston.
This dish is equally good hot or at room temperature.

Set the oven at 425 degrees.  In a large bowl, toss the butternut
squash with the olive oil and salt and pepper. Place the mixture in a
large heavy duty baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 10
to 20 minutes or until soft but still holding its shape.

While the squash is baking, place the red wine vinegar, hone and
garlic in a small sauce pan.  In a grinder or using a mortal and
pestle, grind the chilies, coriander seed and fennel seed together
and add to the saucepan.
Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce to 1/2 cup. Taste to make
sure the glaze is a little more tangy then sweet and adjust
seasonings if necessary.

When the squash is cooked, remove from the oven and place in a
decorative bowl.  Toss with the glaze, adjusting the salt and pepper
if needed.
