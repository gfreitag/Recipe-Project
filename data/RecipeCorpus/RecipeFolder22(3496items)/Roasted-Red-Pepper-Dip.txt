~-- Preheat the broiler.  Slice the peppers in half lengthwise, and
core and seed.  Lay the pieces skin side up in a shallow broiling pan
and set the pan 3 inches below the heat.  Broil the peppers until the
skin blisters and turns black.  Remove the peppers to a plastic bag
and close it; let them steam for 15 minutes.  When they are cool
enough to handle, peel off the skin.  Meanwhile, break the bread into
a small bowl, add the milk, and soak for 10 minutes.

Combine the bread, peppers, olives and garlic in a food processor and
process with a pulsing motion for about 4 seconds.  Add the oil, lemon
juice and Tabasco sauce, pulse for 3 seconds longer.  Spoon the dip
into a serving bowl, cover and let stand at least 30 minutes to blend
the flavors. Garnish with sliced olives.  From: The Tabasco Cookbook.
