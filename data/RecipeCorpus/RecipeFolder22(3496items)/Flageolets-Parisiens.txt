Categories: Vegetable, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Butter or Soy Margarine
1 ts Garlic, finely minced
1 tb Shallots, finely minced
1/4 c  Soft Silken Tofu
1 lg Tomato, chopped

4    Whole Cloves

Cover flageolets with 2 inches of water in a large saucepan.  Bring
to a boil and simmer 10 minutes; remove from stovetop, cover and let
sit for 1 hour (or soak beans overnight in water).  Drain and rinse
well.

Return beans to saucepan with 6 cups water.  Stick cloves into whole
onion and add to the pan along with carrot, celery, parsley, thyme,
savory and bay leaf.  Partially cover pan with lid, and simmer for
about 50 minutes, or until beans are tender.  Remove and discard bay
leaf and onion.

Melt butter or soy margarine, and saute garlic and shallots until
softened. Add to beans with tofu and tomato.  Reheat for 5 minutes,
stirring occasionally.  Garnish with parsley. A tasty side dish
that's reminiscent of a French cassoulet.
