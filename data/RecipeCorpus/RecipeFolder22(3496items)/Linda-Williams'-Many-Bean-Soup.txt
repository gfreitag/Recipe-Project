Wash the beans and pick them over. Cover with water and let soak

2 qts. of water and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and simmer 2
1/2 to 3 hours. Add all the other ingredients and simmer another 45
mins.

If you want, you can also add 1 C of diced potatoes. This is a
wonderful soup!

Gayes notes:  I used 1/4 lb smoked turkey instead of the hamhock.
Also, I used 2 9 oz cans of tomatoes.  Next time, I will only use one
can. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.50 ---
