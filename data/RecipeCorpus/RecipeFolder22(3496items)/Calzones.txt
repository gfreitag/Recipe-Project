MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
Dissolve yeast in warm water (about 105 degrees or just warm to
touch). Let sit for about 5 minutes or untilyeast starts coming to
the top of the water. Add the oil, salt and Sucanat and mix well. Add
the whole whet flour and mix with wooden spoon, scraping the sides of
the bowl often. Stir for about 150 strokes (the gluten strands will
be forming). Add the rest of the flour except fo the last 1/4 cup.
Stir vigorously. If the dough seems stiff enough to handle, don't add
the rest of the flour; if not, stir in the rest of the flour. Turn
dough out onto a floured board and knead for about 5 minutes. Try not
to add extra flour as the more flour you add the drier the final
product will be. Oil or wet your hands so dough doesn't stick to your
hands while kneading. Place dough into a clean bowl, cover with a
piece of plastic wrap (so dough won't stick to it, should it rise and
it it) and set in a warm place to rise for about an hour.

Meanwhile, prepare the filling; heat a heavy skillet over a medium
heat. Add the onions, stir and reduce heat.Cover with a lid directly
over the onions, to let the onions "sweat." When onions are
transparent, add mushrooms, celery, tomatoes, olives, basil, oregano,
and tomato paste. Mix well and continue to cook for aout 5 minutes.
Add the crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, arrowroot, salsa (if
desired) and salt to taste. Stir and simmer for about 15 minutes. If
the dough mixture isn't quite ready yet, let mixture cool for a bit.

When dough is doubled in bulk (or nearly doubled--don't let it rise
too long), punch it down and turn it out onto a floured counter
again. Divide it into 6 equal, or nearly-equal portions. Roll each
portion into a circle (or pat it into a circle) about 1/4 inch thick.
For each portion, use 1/6 of the filling, palcing the filling over
1/2 of the circle. Try to leave a 1/2-inch rim around the outside.
Fould dough over, stretching, if necessary. Press down around the
outside with a fork, dipped in water so it doesn't stick.

Place on an oiled baking sheet and lightly brush with oil over the
tops. Make a few incisions with a knife on each calzone.Bake in a
preheated 450-degree oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden brown.
It is okay to bake in two batches if you have a small oven.

Serves 6 or 3 calzone-crazed people.
