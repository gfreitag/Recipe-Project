Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Using 1 slice at a time, roll bread out
thin and cut into 2-1/1" rounds with a plain cooky cutter. Brush with
melted butter and press into mini muffin tins. Bake for about 5
minutes or until the edges of the cups are golden brown. Remove from
tins and cool. These cups can be frozen empty or filled. Filling: In
large saucepan melt butter, add flour and whisk until smooth. Add the
milk and bring mixture to a boil, whisking constantly. Mixture will
thicken at the boil. Lower heat and cook for another 2 minutes. Add
cheese and whisk until it melts into the sauce. Add roasted peppers
and scallions and mix well. Add shrimp and sherry and stir until very
well combined and the alcohol in the sherry has burned away.  Season
with salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Let cool a bit and fill mini
cups. You can serve them now or freeze them for later use.
