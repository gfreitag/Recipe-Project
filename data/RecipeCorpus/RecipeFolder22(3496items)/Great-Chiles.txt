Title: Great Chiles
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Tex/mexican, Chilies
Yield: 6 servings
6    Eggs
3/4 ts Salt
Creme Fresca:
1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
3 tb Sour cream
12 lg Fresh Poblano chilies
1/2 lb Monterey Jack or Chihuahua
-cheese, cubed
1/4 sm Yellow onion, coarsely
-chopped
1 lg Garlic clove, halved
Make the Creme Fresca ahead of time:  mix cream and sour cream
together. Cover and let stand at room temp. until thickened, 8 hours
or overnight. Chill until ready to use.

Char the chili peppers over a gas flame until blackened on all sides.
Wrap them in a plastic bag and let stand for 10 minutes to steam.
Peel and core the chilies.  Remove seeds, rinse and pat dry.

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Generously butter a 9" pie pan (preferably
porcelain or stoneware with 2" sides).  Open up chili peppers and
arrange around sides of pan skin side down, point toward center of
pan, extending about 1/2" above rim. Cover bottom of pan with chilies.

Finely grate cheese with onion and garlic in a processor using on/off
pulses, about 30 seconds.  Add eggs and salt.  Process until smooth,
stopping to scrape down the sides, about 15 seconds.  Mix in the Creme
Fresca (the Mexican equivalent of creme fraiche).  Pour this filling
over the chilies.  Curl the edges of the chilies over the filling.

Bake until golden brown and a knife inserted in the center comes out
clean, 45 to 50 minutes.  Cover chili edges with foil to prevent
burning, if necessary.  Cool for 5 minutes before cutting.  Serve hot
or at room temperature.

Serves 6 main course servings.
