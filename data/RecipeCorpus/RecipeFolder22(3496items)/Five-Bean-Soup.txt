beans are tender, stirring occasionally, about 1-1/2 hours.  Season
to taste with salt.
Heat oil in heavy skillet over low heat.  Add onion, Sherry and
garlic. Cover and cook until onion is soft, stirring occasionally,
about 15 minutes.  Add bell pepper, carrot, celery, cumin and
coriander. Cover and continue cooking until vegetables are tender,
stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Add vegetable mixture to
