Thoroughly wash all greens to remove grit and pick out bad leaves;
place in a large pot with onion and garlic. Cover with water and boil
for 30 minutes. Drain cooked greens, reserving liquid. Puree greens
in a food processor or grind in a meat grinder; set aside. Meanwhile,
cut meats and sausages into bite-size pieces. Place smoked sausage,
ham, stew meat and brisket in a 12-quart stockpot; add 2 c reserved
liquid from greens and steam for 15 minutes. Place chaurice in a
skillet and steam until all grease is cooked out; remove chaurice
from skillet and set aside. Stir flour into chaurice drippings in
skillet and cook for 5 minutes or until flour is cooked (it does not
have to brown). Pour roux over meat in stock pot, stirring well. Add
pureed greens and 2 qt of the reserved liquid from greens; simmer for
20 minutes. Add chaurice, salt, cayenne and thyme, stirring well.
Simmer for 40 minutes. Stir in file powder and remove from heat.
Serve over rice. This dish (without the meat) is eaten by Catholics
during Lent. Source: Chef John Folse, Lafitte's Landing Restaurant,
