Title: Grilled Portobella Mushrooms with Mango Chutney
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
-soy sauce 	vinegar
1 t  Miso  	1 bunch arugula
-lettuce
4    Portobella mushrooms  	1
-large ripe mango
1    Red bell pepper 	1 jalapeno
-pepper (optional)
Carefully remove stems from mushrooms (use for soup) and clean them
thoroughly. Marinate in vinegar/miso/soy sauce for an hour or so.
Dice the mango and pepper, chop the jalapeno, and toss with a little
vinegar. Clean the lettuce and separate into single leaves. Grill the
mushrooms on both sides. When grilling the top, turn the mushroom 90
degrees halfway through to get a square or diamond crosshatch
pattern. To serve, fan 3 lettuce leaves on the plate, center the
mushroom, and place a dollop of chutney on either side. The original
recipe is in Vegetarian Times, probably sometime last summer. Enjoy!
