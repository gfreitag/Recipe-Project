Title: Pimiento Cheese Spread
Categories: Appetizer, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Sugar
1 lb Velveta (softened or melted)
1 md Size can Pimentos (mashed)
sprinkle of Black Pepper

Mix together and add enough mayonnaise or salad dressing to make
moist and spreadable (about 1/2 c), adding more sugar for taste.

I soften velveda/pimento in micro for 2 min or so, then use Hellman
mayo, and sometimes a touch of minced fresh onion.
