Lentils were eaten long before Rome was founded; it is generally
thought that the pottage for which Esau sold his birthright to Jacob
(Genesis 25) was a stew of lentils. Sidney Taylor offers a better
deal; you can have his recipe for lentils and keep your birthright.
And we may assume that his lentil bisque is smoother. Jacob had no
blender.

======================================================================
====

In an 8-10 quart pan, combine broth, celery, carrots, chopped onions,
bell pepper, zucchini, and lentils. Bring to a boil over high heat,
then cover and simmer until lentils are very soft to bite, 50-55
minutes.

Whirl mixture, a portion at a time, in a blender or food processor
until smooth. Return to pan and stir in dry sherry and cream sherry.
(If made ahead, or if there are no leftovers, cover and chill up to 4
days; or freeze in 2- or 3-serving portions.) Heat until steaming and
ladle onto bowls. Add green onion, sour cream, and salt and pepper to
taste.
