chicken with a few celery tops.  Cover and simmer for about 1 hour or
until fork tender. Drain and strain the broth; reserve.  Bone the
chicken and cut into 1/2 inch pieces to measure about 2-1/2 cups.  In
a skillet, melt the butter. Add the apple, onion and curry powder.
Saute for 5 minutes, blending well. Stir in raisins, 1 cup of the
reserved chicken broth, and the Coca-Cola. In a bowl, mix flour with
the Half and Half, stirring until smooth. Add the salt and white
pepper to the onion apple mixture. Stir and cook over low heat until
thick and creamy.  Taste for seasoning. Add the chicken and turn into
a covered container to chill overnight. Reheat in the top of a double
boiler over hot water and serve on cooked rice with a selection of
condiments; including, grated coconut, chopped peanuts, chopped raw
onions, raisins, sweet pickle relish, chutney, chow chow, andor lime
wedges. From: "International Cooking with Coca-Cola", a give away
