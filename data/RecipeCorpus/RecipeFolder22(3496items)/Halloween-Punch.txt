Here are some other good ideas from the book which you could also use
as a contest or conversation starter.  (My idea) l. Turn sandwiches
intoi jack-o'lanters! Cut eyes, nose, and mouth into the top layer of
bread and let the top layer (preferably much darker--or much
lighter--than the bread show through. 2. Make edible spiders for
Halloween treats: a prune for the body, licorice slivers or stick

jack-o'-lantern on the pumpkin shell.
