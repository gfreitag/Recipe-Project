Categories: Chinese, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
4    Green onions, shredded
1/2 c  Nami dried black mushrooms,
-soaked & shredded
1/2 c  Cloud Ear dried fungus,
-soaked
1/2 c  Dried lily flowers, soaked
-and hard tips removed
2 oz Bean thread noodles, soaked
1 ts Salt (to taste)
6 tb To 8 tb oil for stir-frying
1 c  Carrots, shredded
1 c  White Chinese turnip,
-shredded
1 c  White Chinese celery,
-shredded
8    Pieces soy spiced bean curd
-(or Loma Linda brand
-Vegetable Hamburger)
3 c  Soybean sprouts (NOT mung
-bean sprouts)
Preparation:  Shred in 2" lengths:  carrots, turnip, Chinese celery
and bean curd.  Shred onions, greens & all, into 2" lengths.

Rinse, then soak in hot water:  enough mushrooms, fungus and lily
flowers to give specified amounts.  Shred mushrooms, chop fungus.
Soak bean thread noodles.  Bean thread noodles are important because
they soak up excess moisture from the vegetables.  Vegetables should
be moist but not soggy or watery after stir-frying.

Stir-frying:  Stir-fry fresh vegetables separately with about 1
tablespoon oil for each, in hot wok.  Add salt to taste.  Drain off
excess water, reserve.  (Soybean sprouts should be cooked until they
are slightly charred for fullest flavor.) To stir-fry dried soaked
ingredients, begin with hot wok, add 2 to 3 tablespoons oil, then add
mushroom, fungus & lily flowers.

Stir-fry green onions, add all other ingredients to them, including
noodles.  Allow dish to cool before serving.

NOTE:  Fresh or canned bamboo shoot may be substituted for any
vegetable. Seaweed may be used instead of some of the fungus.
