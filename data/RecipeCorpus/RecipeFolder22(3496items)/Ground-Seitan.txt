Title: Ground Seitan
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
1    Raw gluten recipe
Place the raw gluten on a well-oiled cookie sheet.
Using your hands and/or a rolling pin, flatten the gluten out to a
slab that is about 1/2 inch thick.
Bake at 350 deg for about 15 minutes.

After 15 minutes or more of baking, the gluten should begin topuff
up and form  air pockets. Poke these bubles with a fork to let the
air escape and allow for more even cooking. Bake the gluten for 15-20
minutes more.

Remove the gluten from the oven and from the cookie sheet. Fold it
in half and cover it with a large inverted bowl. Let the gluten
stand, covered, for about 10 minutes to soften the crust.

Tear or cut the baked gluten into pieces and place it in the food
processor. Briefly grind it to obtain a ground-beef-like texture. If
you prefer, you may run the gluten through a meat grinder instead of
a food processor.

Use the ground seitan to make Ground Seitan Mix. Or use it in any
recipe that is traditionally made with ground beef.
