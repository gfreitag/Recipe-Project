1/4 ts Ginger,ground
1 c  Peaches,sliced,frozen(8oz)

MMMMM---------------------------CREPES--------------------------------
3/4 c  Flour,all-purpose
1/2 ts Salt
Butter,melted
4    Egg yolks

3 tb Butter or margarine,melted
1. In small mixer bowl, beat egg whites with cream of tartar at high
speed until foamy.

2. Add granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating constantly
until sugar is dissolved (to test if sugar has been dissolved, rub
just a bit of meringue between thumb and forefinger) and whites are
glossy and stand in soft peaks.

3. Beat in rum extract; gently fold in pecans.

4. Spread about 1/3 cup meringue across half of each crepe.

5. Staring at midpoint of edge of filled side, roll up crepe, pressing
lightly so filling puffs out at ends of rolled crepe.

6. Arrange filled crepes in greased 13x9x2-inch baking dish; bake in
preheated 475'F. oven until meringue is firm but not brown, about 7
to 9 minutes.

7. Meanwhile, in small saucepan over medium heat, bring brown sugar,
water and ginger to a boil. 8. Boil and stir syrup until thickened,
about 4 minutes.

9. Gently stir in peaches; cook until heated through, about 1 to 2
minutes.

10. Serve crepes hot with peach syrup.

1. In mixer bowl, combine egg yolks, milk, water and 3 tablespoons
melted butter; beat until well blended.

2. Add flour and salt; beat until smooth.

3. Heat 10-inch omelet or crepe pan over medium-high heat, until just
hot enough to sizzle a drop of water.

4. Brush pan lightly with melted butter.

5. For each crepe, pour in 1/4 cup batter, tipping and tilting pan to
move batter quickly over bottom.

6. Cook until lightly browned on bottom and dry on top.

7. Remove crepe from pan or, if desired, turn and brown other side.

8. Brush pan lightly with melted butter as needed to prevent sticking.
