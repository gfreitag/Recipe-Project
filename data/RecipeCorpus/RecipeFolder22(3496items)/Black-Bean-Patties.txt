Title: Black Bean Patties
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Cooked brown rice
1 c  Soymilk
2 c  Cooked black beans
1 c  Cornmeal
1 T  Cumin
The North  American Indians made patties  of black beans and cornmeal,
cooking  them over campfires.  Brown  rice has been added to give
them more substance, though the Native Americans on the plains would
have used wild rice.  For a main dish,  you can make or buy a
mushroom gravy to serve over the  patties, serving with a green
vegetable and salad. Uncooked patties can be wrapped in wax paper and
frozen, then for a quick meal you can defrost and fry or grill. This
is a nice way to use up leftover rice or beans, but you can also cook
some for the occasion. For breakfast, you can serve with warm maple
syrup.

Cool the  beans and rice,  if you have  just cooked them. Combine all
the ingredients well.  Add more cornmeal  as needed to form a stiff
dough. Form into  patties.  Add corn oil to a frying pan and fry, or
grill over charcoal. Cooking black beans: put 1 cup dry black beans
in 3 cups water and store  overnight (a  quart canning  jar works
well for this.) Bring to a  boil  in  fresh  water  and simmer around
40 minutes. Cooking brown rice: place 1 cup  brown rice in 2 1/2 cups
water. Bring to a boil, then cover  and simmer  until water has
disappeared, about 35 minutes. Let the rice rest with cover on an
additional 10 minutes. From: Mary Howard.
