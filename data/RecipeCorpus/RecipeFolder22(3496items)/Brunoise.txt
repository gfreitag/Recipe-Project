Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings
1    Celery rib, finely diced
2    Scallions, finely sliced
-into rings
Salt and black pepper (to
-taste)
4 c  Beef bouillion
2    Egg whites and shells,
-crushed
1 c  Water
2 tb Butter
1    Carrot, finely diced
Pour the bouillion into a large pot.  Be careful not to allow any
sediment to be added.  Lightly beat the egg whites with the water and
add this to the bouillion with the crushed egg shells.  Bring the
stock to a boil and simmer for 1 hour.  Skim the foam from the top
and strain the stock through a sieve that has been lined with several
layers of cheese cloth. You now have a clear consomme. Melt the
butter in a small saucepan and add the finely diced and sliced
vegetables. Spoon 2 or 3 Tbsp. of the consomme over the vegetables,
cover the pan, and braise the vegetables slowly for about 10 minutes
or until tender. To serve, reheat the consomme and garnish it with
the braised vegetables. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
