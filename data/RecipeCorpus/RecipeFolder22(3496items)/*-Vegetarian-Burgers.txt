Preheat broiler. Broil 18 minutes, 3" from heat source, turning once.

Notes...

Rather than use an oiled broiler rack, I used a nonstick baking
sheet. I had no problem with the burgers sticking however, be
careful, I think I warped my baking sheet a bit as a result.

To toast sesame seeds, place in a oven safe bowl and bake at 300 to
325 degrees, stirring often until they have darkened a bit and are
too hot to hold in your hand (ouch! be careful!).  If you use
unhulled sesame seeds (recomended), be sure to process them a bit in
a blender after toasting.

When I made this the yield was actually 8 burgers, however I used
large carrots, shredded rather than medium ones grated.
