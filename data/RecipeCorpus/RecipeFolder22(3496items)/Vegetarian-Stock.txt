I rarely peel potatoes, but when I do, I save the peels for this
delicious stock.  Keep vegetable trimmings in a plastic bag in the
freezer until you have enough for stock.

1. Slice cloves of garlic, Chop onions and slice celery.
2. Place all of ghe ingredients in a large stock pot.
3. Bring to a boil.  Remove any foam that may come to the top.
4. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
5. Strain the stock, cool, cover and refrigerate or freeze
