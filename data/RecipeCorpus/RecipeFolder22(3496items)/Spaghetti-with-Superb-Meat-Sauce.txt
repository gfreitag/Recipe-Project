Long, slow simmering of meat and herbs produces the base for this
incomparable sauce. Season roast with salt; dredge with flour. In
Dutch oven brown slowly on all sides in hot olive oil. Add hot water;
cover and cook slowly 3 hours or until meat almost falls apart. Tear
into small pieces with fork.  Add remaining ingredients except
spaghetti and cheese. Cover tightly and simmer 2 hours longer,
stirring occasionally. Remove cover and continue cooking until sauce
thickens to desired consistency. Cook spaghetti following directions
on package, allowing 1 pound for 4 servings.  Ladle sauce over
spaghetti. Top with cheese. Makes about 3 1/2 quarts sauce, enough
for 4 pounds spaghetti. NOTE: Since you may not need such a large
quantity of spaghetti, freeze extra sauce in half-pint, pint or quart
freezer jars and use as needed. I prefer to use rump roast, but chuck
or round is acceptable.
