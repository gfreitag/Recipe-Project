Title: Happy "Chicken" Burgers
Categories: Vegetarian, Asian
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Whole-wheat flour
1/4 c  Nutritional yeast
1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
2 ts Baking powder**
1/2 ts Poultry seasoning
1 c  Firm tofu*
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Minced green onions
2 c  Finely grated green cabage
1 c  Finely grated carrots
*wrapped in clean towel for 10 minutes or more. **many baking sodas
contain aluminum which is to be avoided. 1.Cut tofu in thin slices
and wrap in several thickness of kitchen towel while you prepare
other ingredients. 2.Heat oil in a skillet and add green onions.
Saute briefly, then add cabbage and carrot and saute for 4 to 5
minutes, until soft. Set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 3.Cream
the tofu in a food processor. Add the flour, yeast, soy sauce, baking
powder, and poultry seasoning. Process until smooth. Add vegetables
and pulse 3 times, just to combine and chop slightly.  (This can also
be done by hand.) 4.Spoon 1/3 cup of mixture onto an oiled baking
sheet. Flatten to 1/4 to 1/2 inch patties and shape in neat rounds.
Bake for 15 minutes, then turn over and bake an additional 10
minutes. 5.Serve burgers on buns with Almonnaise, sliced tomato,
sliced pickle, and sprouts. Or serve simply as pancakes with a
sweet-and-sour sauce.
