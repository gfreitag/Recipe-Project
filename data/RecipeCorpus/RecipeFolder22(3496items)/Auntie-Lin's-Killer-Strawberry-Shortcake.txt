Title: Auntie Lin's Killer Strawberry Shortcake
Categories: Dessert
Yield: 1 servings
Fresh sliced strawberries
Fresh whipped cream
Bisquick drop biscuits
French vanilla ice cream
This is a really easy dessert, loaded with calories, and not for the
faint-of-heart!

Make the bisquick drop biscuits as directed on the package, BUT add 1
tb of sugar (or 2, if you like). Bake as directed.

While still warm, cut in half and put the bottom half in a bowl.
Cover with fresh strawberries (which you have marinated in 4 Tb sugar
in the refrigerator for 2 days), add a scoop or two of French vanilla
ice cream, and then top with the top layer of the biscuit.

Now, cover with more strawberries and top with fresh whipped cream.

Enjoy!
