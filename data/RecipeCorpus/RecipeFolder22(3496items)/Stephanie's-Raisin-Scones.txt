Title: Stephanie's Raisin Scones
Categories: Bread
Yield: 6 wedges
2 tb Sugar
1    Yolk of a large egg
3/4 c  Buttermilk or plain yogurt
1    White of a large egg
Additional sugar for
-sprinkling
2 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
8 tb (1 stick) cold unsalted
-butter, cut up
1 c  Raisins
1. Heat oven to 375F. Put flour, baking powder, soda, nutmeg, and
salt into a large bowl. Stir to mix well. Add butter and cut in with
a pastry blender or rub in with your fingers, until the mixture looks
like fine granules. Add raisins and sugar; toss to distribute evenly.

2. Add egg yolk to buttermilk in a measuring cup and whisk with a
fork to blend. Pour over the flour mixture and stir with a fork until
a soft dough forms.

3. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and give 10-12
kneads. Cut dough in half. Knead each half briefly into a ball; turn
smooth side up and pat into a 6 inch circle. Cut in 6 wedges, but do
not separate wedges.

4. In a small bowl, beat the egg white with a fork until just broken
up. Brush to top of each scone with the egg white, and sprinkle
lightly with sugar. With a pancake turner, carefully transfer the two
cut circles to an ungreased cookie sheet. If necessary, reshape
circles so that the 6 wedges in each are touching. This will keep the
raisins from burning. 5. Bake 18-22 minutes or until medium  brown.
Cool on a wire rack. After 5 minutes pull the wedges apart and cover
loosely with a dish towel.

Note: Egg white and sugar can be added before freezing the unbaked
scones.

VARIATION: Coarse Whole-Wheat Raisin Scones: Replace 1 cup all-
purpose flour with 1 cup whole-wheat flour, and add 1/2 cup miller's
bran to the flour mixture. Omit nutmeg.
