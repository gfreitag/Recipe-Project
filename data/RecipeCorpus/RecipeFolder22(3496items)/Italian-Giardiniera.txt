"This basic recipe can be used for pickling chiles either alone or
with a combination of other vegetables. Choose the mixture of
vegetables desired, the amount and type of chiles, and arrange them
attractively in a jar before covering with the pickling solution."

Wash the chiles and with a toothpick poke several holes near the stem
before packing in the jars.

Combine the water, vinegar, and salt in a pan and boil for a minute.
Pour the hot mixture over the vegetables leaving 1/4 inch head space
and cover. Allow the chiles and vegetables to pickle for 2 to 3 weeks
before serving.
