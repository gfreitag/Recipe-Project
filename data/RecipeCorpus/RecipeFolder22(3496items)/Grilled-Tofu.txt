Cut block of tofu lengthwise into 8 equal-sized slices. Set a cutting
board over the sink and place a double layer of paper towels on top.
Arrange tofu in one layer on cutting board, then top with a clean
dishtowel. Place a second board on top, then a 4- to 5-pound weight,
such as a thick phone book or heavy pot. Let sit for 20 minutes.
Uncover tofu and place in one layer in a shallow baking dish.
Drizzle with orange and soy sauce. Marinate at room temperature for
20 minutes. Broil or grill until lightly browned, turning once. Serve
chilled or at room temperature. Serves 8.

Author's Note:  pressed tofu grills beautifully.  I like this
marinated version, which is delicious on top of Cold and Spicy
Noodles (see recipe) or simply as a sandwich filler.
