Categories: Chinese, Vegetarian

1/4 c  Cold water

Peel eggplant.  Cut into 2 inch thick rounds, then slice the rounds
into wedges (i.e., think of how pizza is cut). Saute in some water or
broth in a non stick pan, turning to cook the wedges evenly. Cook for
about 3-5 minutes per side, or until the slices are done to your
liking. Add the scallions.  Mix the sauces and water and pour into
the pan. Stir to coat.
Serve over plain rice with lots of water (the sauce I used was HOT!).
