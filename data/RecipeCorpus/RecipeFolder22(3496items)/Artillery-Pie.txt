Title: Artillery Pie
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 6 servings
1/8 ts Ginger
8    Slices bread
2 tb Butter
4    Golden delicious apples
6 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Lemon juice, fresh
1/2 ts Cinnamon
Cut apples into quarters. Place in a large pot, and add just enough
water to prevent scortching. Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer
covered until apples are soft, about 30 minutes. Put through a sieve,
discard skins and cores. Stir in sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon and
ginger.

Trim the crust from the bread, spread with butter and toast in the

quart baking dish, layer bread and apple mix. Bake at 350F for 30
min. Serve warm.
