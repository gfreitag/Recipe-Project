Title: Barley Soup with Ham
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 5 servings
1/4 ts Ground allspice
1/2 c  Diced smoked ham
3 tb Unsalted butter
1/3 lb Fresh mushrooms, trimmed and
-chopped
3 ts Lemon juice
1 tb Fresh parsley leaves, minced
3 tb Vegetable oil
1    Onion, chopped
2    Garlic cloves, chopped
2    Carrots, diced
2    Ribs celery, diced
3/4 c  Pearl barley
6 c  Chicken broth
1 sm Imported bay leaf
Put the oil and onion in a soup kettle, set over low heat, and cook
until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes.  Raise heat to
medium, stir in the garlic and carrots, and stir-cook for one minute.
Add the celery and stir-cok for a minute.  Add the barley, broth, bay
leaf, and allspice. Bring to the boil, skimming the top of the soup
as necessary. Simmer, covered, for about one hour, or until the
barley is tender.  (The soup may be prepared in advance to this
point.)

Stir the ham into the piping hot soup and let simmer while you
prepare the mushrooms.  Heat the butter in a small skillet, add the
mushrooms and lemon juice, and stir-cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in
the parsley. Add the mushroom mixture to the soup and simmer for 5
minutes longer. Discard the bay leaf.  Season the soup with salt and
freshly- ground pepper to taste. Ladle into warmed bowls and serve
immediately.

Makes 5 servings.
