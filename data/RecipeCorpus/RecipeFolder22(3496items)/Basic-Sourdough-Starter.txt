reserved starter. Store covered at room temp until bubbles appear,
about 12 hrs, refrigerate. Use starter regularly, every week to 10
days. If the volume of the breads you bake begins to decrease,
dissolve 1 t yeast in 1/4 c warm water. Stir in 1/2 c milk, 3/4 c
flour and the remaining starter. *DO NOT USE SELF RISING FLOUR* NOTE:
Start bread at night to bake in the morning - or vice versa. Before
adding the milk and flour to remaining starter, bake your bread and
judge the volume
