"This recipe was loosely inspired by a dish at the retaurant Al Forno
in Providence, R.I.  Curry powder, cilantro and scotch bonnet chilies
lend the chowder a West Indian accent.  (Scotch bonnet are the
world's hottest chilies -- look for them at Caribbean markets.  Or
substitute a milder chili, such as serrano or jalapeno.)  Be sure to
use unsweetened coconut milk, which can be found canned in Indian,
Southeast Asian, and Hispanic markets."

Peel and devein the shrimp and cut into 1 inch pieces.  Remove the
crescent-shaped muscle on the side of the scallops.  Cut large
scallops in quarters, medium size ones in half, so that all are the
same size. Mince the chili, shallots, garlic, scallions and ginger.
Core, seed, and dice the peppers.

Melt the butter in a large saucepan.  Cook the minced and diced
vegetables over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until soft but not
browned. Add the curry powder and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
Add the fish stock and coconut milk and gently simmer for 5 minutes.

Just before serving, add the shrimp and scallops.  Gently simmer for
2 to 3 minutes until the shellfish is firm.  Correct the seasoning,
adding salt, pepper and curry powder to taste.  To serve, ladle the
chowder into bowls and garnish each with chopped cilantro.

Serves 8 to 10.
