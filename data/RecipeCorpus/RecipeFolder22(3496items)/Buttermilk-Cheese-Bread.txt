3 c  Bread flour
1 ts Baking powder

1/2 c  Buttermilk
Have all ingreds. at room temp. except water. Put into pan in order
listed. Set on White Bread setting. Check whether too wet or dry
during knead cycle. Correct with a TBSP or so more of water or flour,
if necessary. This is a dense loaf and I like it best toasted.
Kyllikki, there is also a seed bread loaf and a Potato Loaf Bread
that I'll be glad to send you adaptions to use s/d starter with, if
you're interested. 08/29 02:41 am JUDY/NC PJXG05A FROM: JUDY GARNETT
