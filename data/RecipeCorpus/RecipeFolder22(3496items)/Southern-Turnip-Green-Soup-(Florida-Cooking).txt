Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
5 1/2 c  Chicken stock
2 tb Lemon juice
2 c  Half-and-half
4 tb Cooked grits
Salt and freshly ground-
-pepper to taste
1 bn Young turnip greens with-
-turnips (1 pound)
6 tb Butter
1 c  Chopped onions
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/4 ts Sugar
Cut the turnip roots off the greens.  Clean and wash the greens,
discarding any blemished or yellowed edges.  Tear the large leaves
into smaller pices. Trim the ends and peel the turnips.  Cube into
bite-size pieces, enough to make 4 cups.

Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over moderate
heat. Add the turnips and saute until crisp-tender, about 10 minutes.
Add the onions, and saute 5 minutes or until tender, but not browned.
Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon sugar, and 1 1/2 cups of the
chicken stock. Blend well, stir in the lemon juice, and set aside.

In another skillet, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter.  Add
the greens and saute over medium heat for 10 minutes, until
crisp-tinder.  Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of
sugar, and remaining 4 cups chicken stock.  Blend well and remove
from the heat and cool for 15 minutes.  Puree the greens in a food
processor or in batches in a blender. Add the pureed greens to the
turnip mixture.  Mix together and reheat. Add the half-and-half and
the cooked grits, and adjust the salt and pepper to taste.  Serve hot.
