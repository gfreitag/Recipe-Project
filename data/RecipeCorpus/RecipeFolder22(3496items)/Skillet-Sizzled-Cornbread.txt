Title: Skillet Sizzled Cornbread
Categories: Bread
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 ts Baking soda
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
1    Egg
2 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
3 tb Butter
1 c  Stone ground yellow
-cornmeal
1 c  Unbleached all purpose
-flour
1 tb Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a large bowl, combine cornmeal,
flour, baking powder and salt.  In a small bowl, stir the baking soda
into the buttermilk.  In another bowl, whisk together the egg, sugar
to taste, and the oil, then whisk this mixture into the buttermilk
mixture. Spray an 8 or 9 inch cast-iron skillet with vegetable
cooking spray. Put the skillet over medium high heat.  Add butter;
heat until butter melts and is just starting to sizzle.  Tilt the pan
to coat the bottom and sides. Add buttermilk mixture to cornmeal
mixture; quickly stir together, using only as many strokes as needed
to combine the mixtures. Scrape the batter into the hot, buttery
skillet. Immediately put the skillet into the preheated oven and bake
about 25 minutes, or until cornbread is golden brown. Cut into wedges
to serve. (For a decandent cornbread, substitute 1 3/4 cups sour
cream for the 1 1/4 cups buttermilk.)
