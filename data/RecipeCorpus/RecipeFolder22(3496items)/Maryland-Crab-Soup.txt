Title: Maryland Crab Soup
Categories: Seafood, Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
Salt & pepper
2 tb Old Bay
6    Live crabs
1 1/3 qt Water
1 cn Tomatoes, peeled
1/2 lb Baccon
1 lb Beef stew meat
2 lb Frozen mixed vegetables*
10 oz Pck frozen whole kernal
-corn*
1 c  Celery, diced
*Fresh or canned vegetables can be used. I have used fresh corn on
the cob. Fry baccon and put into large pot. Brown stew meat in baccon
grease and add to pot along with vegetables. Add vegetables. Bring to
boil and simmer for 1 hour or until stew meat is done. Add salt and
pepper to taste. Clean crabs by removing top shell and devil (lungs).
Break crabs in half and add to pot along with Old Bay and boil slowly
for half an hour or longer. The longer it cooks the better it tastes.
