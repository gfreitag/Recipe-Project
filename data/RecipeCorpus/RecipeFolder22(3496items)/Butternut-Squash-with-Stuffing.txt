1 ts Salt, seasoned
1 c  Orange juice, fresh
4 md Butternut squash
2 c  ;water
3/4 c  Wild rice, raw; rinsed

Halve the squashes and scoop out seeds and fibers. Place them cut
side up in shallow baking dishes and cover tightly with covers or
foil. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until easily pierced with a
knife, but still firm.

In the meantime, bring the water to a boil in a saucepan. Stirin the
rice, reduce to a simmer, then cover and cook until the water is
absorbed, about 40 minutes.

Heat 2 T of the soy margarine in a skillet. Add the onion and garlic
and saute until the onion is limp and golden.

In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked wild rice with the sauteed onion
and the remaining ingredients. When the squashes are cool enough to
handle, scoop out the pulp, leaving firm shells aobut 12/2 inch
thick. Chop the pulp and stir it into the rice mixture. Stuff the
squashes, place in foil-lined baking dishes, and cover.

Before serving, place the squashes in a preheated 350-degree oven.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until well heated through.
