Title: Quince-And-Cranberry Compote
Categories: Fruit, Dessert
Yield: 8 servings
1 lg Orange peel strip
2 pk Cranberries
1    Cinnamon stick (3" long)
Cranberry juice (optional)
Balsamic vinegar, to taste
6 md Quince
6 c  Water
2 c  Sugar
12    Cloves
18    Whole allspice berries
CUT EACH QUINCE INTO QUARTERS, then cut quarters into pieces about
1/2-inch thick. Grasp each piece firmly and cut away peel and core
with sharp knife. When all slices have been cored and peeled, cut
each piece into small chunks. Don't worry about the fruit
discoloring. In saucepan, combine water, sugar, spices and orange
peel. Bring mixture to boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add quince.
Reduce heat, cover pan and cook very slowly until fruit has turned a
deep pink color, about 2 hours. You don't need to worry about
overcooking as the fruit will hold its texture well. If cooked
slowly, there should still be quite a bit of liquid in pan when fruit
is done. Sort through cranberries, remove those that are not in good
shape and rinse the rest. Add cranberries to cooked quince. If
mixture seems too dry, add a little more water or cranberry juice.
Increase heat a little and cook cranberries until they begin to pop
open, 12-to-15 minutes. Use rubber scraper to gently mix them with
quince. When done, refrigerate compote to cool, then stir in enough
vinegar to balance the sweetness.
