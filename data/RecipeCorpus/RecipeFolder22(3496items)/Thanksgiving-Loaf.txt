Categories: Vegetarian, Holiday
Yield: 10 servings
-Garlic power (optional,
-can be added while
-eating)
3 c  Cooked millet
1 c  Whole wheat bread,
-crumbled (3 slices)
1 c  Chopped onions
1 T  Light
-vegetable oil
1/2 t  Celery seed,
-ground
-Salt to taste
3 c  Cooked lentils
3 c  Steamed brown rice
1/2 c  Dry oatmeal or cornmeal
1/2 c  Almond or cashews, ground
-fine  3/4 cup (approx.)
-tomato juice
1/4 c  Sunflower seeds, ground
-fine
-(optional)
1 c  Chopped celery
1 c  Chopped tomatoes
1    Heaping tablespoon of sage
-(this is the key spice)
Lightly saute onions in a mixture of water and oil.

Add celery and tomatoes, but only saute very little to soften and
stop. (the celery, if not over-cooked, gives a nice "crunch" to the
loaf)

Combine all the ingredients and mix well, add bread crumbs and tomato
juice to make stiff.  Add water if the mixture seems too dry. Place
in lightly oiled loaf pans.  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 1 hour.

Serve with favourite veggy ``gravy'' (optional.) After baking, cover
with towel to keep moist, or if you like it dry, don't cover.

Serve with Parsley "Gravy" Entered Separately
