From: Gourmet Vegetarian Feasts, by Martha Rose Shulman, 1989.

Heat safflower oil and saute onions and garlic until onion is tender
Add carrots and leeks, saute a few more minutes and add split peas,
water, bay leaf, salt, and freshly ground pepper to taste.  Bring to
a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 1 hour, or until peas are
tender. Remove bay leaf

Puree half the soup in a blender or through a food mill and return to
pot. Adjust seasonings.

Heat butter in a pan and add garlic and bread cubes.  Saute until
cubes are golden (this can be done in advance).  Remove from heat.

Heat soup through and serve, topping each bowl with a generous
handful of croutons.  This freezes well.
