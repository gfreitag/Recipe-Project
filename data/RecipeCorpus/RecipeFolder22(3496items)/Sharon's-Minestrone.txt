Title: Sharon's Minestrone
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Tomato juice
1    (14oz) can kidney beans,
-drained
2 ts Basil
1/2 ts Oregano
1 c  Barley
2 tb Chopped parsley
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 c  Chopped onion
2    Garlic cloves, finely
-chopped
6    Bacon slices
1 c  Chopped celery
1 c  Chopped carrots
2 c  Beef stock
salt and pepper to taste

In a large saucepan, saute onions and garlic in vegetable oil.  In a
small frying pan, cook bacon, drain off fat and cut bacon into small
pieces. (To save a step, I cut the bacon into bite size chunks first
and then cook them in the same pot that the soup is going to be in.
Gives it a bit more flavour. Just drain off excess fat.)  To the
saucepans,add bacon, celery, carrots, beef stock and tomato juice;
cook until vegetables are just tender, about 10 minutes. Add the rest
of the ingredients and cook until barley is tender, about 20-30
minutes. Serves 6-8.
