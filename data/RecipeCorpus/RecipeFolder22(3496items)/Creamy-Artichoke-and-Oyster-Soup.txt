Categories: Soup/stew, Seafood
Yield: 2 servings
1    Cl Garlic
1/4 c  Parsley; chopped
Generous pinch of thyme
1 c  Cream
Salt and freshly ground pepp
-er to taste
2 c  Artichoke hearts
12    Oysters; jar, or fresh
4 tb Butter
4 tb Flour
1 c  Milk
3    Green onions; chopped
Reserve four artichoke hearts for garnish; cut each in two or
four pieces and set aside.  Buzz the rest with their liquid in the
blender.
Make a white roux with the butter and flour, letting them cook
together, stirring, without browning.  Stir in the artichoke puree,
any liquid from the oysters and 1 cup milk.  Simmer with the green
onions, garlic, thyme and parsley, salt and pepper for about 10
minutes or until the flavors are well blended.  Add the oysters and
the cream and heat just until the oysters plump and curl around the
edges. Serve in deep bowls immediately, the top garnished with the
reserved artichokes. This was printed years ago in a column in the
Times-Picayune called "Pot au Feu". Source: Myriam Guidroz
