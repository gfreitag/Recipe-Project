Title: Sweet Squash Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Chopped carrot
2 t  Minced fresh ginger
5 c  Water
1 lg Butternut or buttercup
- squash
1 1/2 c  Sliced onion
1 1/2 c  Peeled & chopped apple
Put the whole squash in a microwave oven and cook on high power for 8
minutes. Peel the squash and cut into cubes. (If you don't have a
microwave oven, this step may be omitted. This brief cooking time
simply makes the squash easier to peel and cut up.)

Place all of the ingredients in a large soup pot and simmer over
medium-low heat for 45 minutes. Place the soup in a blender or food
processor, in batches, and blend until smooth and creamy.
