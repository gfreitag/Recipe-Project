Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Main dish, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Condensed milk or light
-cream
Cornstarch paste
1/4 ts Sesame oil
1 c  Rice stick, broken up
2 c  Oil for deep-frying
1 lb Chicken breast, boned
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1 tb Sherry
1/2 ts Ginger root juice
1 ts Sugar
1 pn Salt
Velvet chicken:  Heat 6 cups of water to boil.  Reduce to simmer.
Remove skin from chicken breast; cut breast into 1" chunks.  Simmer
in uncovered pan for 3 to 5 minutes, until meat is cooked through.
The term "velvet" denotes a method of poaching chicken breast to turn
it white and make the texture very soft and smooth.  Care must be
taken to use simmering liquid for just long enough to cook the
chicken through. Boiling water or prolonged poaching will toughen the
texture.

Sauce:  In wok or sauce pan, heat chicken stock, sherry, ginger juice,
sugar and salt.  When sauce is very hot, slowly add condensed milk or
cream.  Stir to combine.  DON'T ALLOW SAUCE TO BOIL.  Dribble in
cornstarch paste to thicken.  Enrich with sesame oil.  Add chicken
before serving to reheat.

Rice stick:  Heat oil in wok for deep-frying until hot enough to puff
up rice stick but not brown it.  Fry in small batches; drain. Process
takes just seconds.  Place rice stick on platter; cover with chicken.

Serves 4. Happy Charring
