1 tb Sugar
3 c  Bread Flour
1 1/2 ts Yeast
2 ts Wheat Germ
3/4 c  Mashed Potatoes *
3/4 c  Potato Water
2 1/4 tb Vegetable Oil
3/4 ts Salt
* Mashed Potatoes = Use boiled or instant, but add minced onion,
parmesan cheese and horseradish. The dough is very liquid and the
bread will not rise very high but it makes a chewy bread similar in
texture to a knish or a potato kugel.
