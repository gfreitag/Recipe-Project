Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetarian

1/2    Bay leaf
4    Parsley sprigs
3 tb Olive oil
3    Egg yolks
4 tb Olive oil
French bread rounds, toasted
1 c  Grated Swiss or Parmesan
1    Head of garlic
- cloves separated, unpeeled
2 qt Water
2 ts Salt
1 pn Pepper
2    Cloves

DROP GARLIC CLOVES in boiling water and boil 30 seconds. Drain, run
cold water over the cloves and peel. Place the garlic and the rest of
the ingredients up to the egg yolks in a saucepan and boil slowly for
30 minutes. Correct the seasoning. Beat the egg yolks in a soup
tureen until they're thick and sticky. Drop by drop, beat in the
olive oil as if making a mayonnaise. Just before serving, beat a
ladleful of hot soup into the egg mixture by droplets. Gradually
strain in the rest, beating, and pressing the juice out of the
garlic. Serve immediately, accompanied by the bread and cheese.
