Title: Blue Cheese & Walnuts
Categories: Appetizer, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
1    Egg beaten with 1 tb water
1 c  Walnuts
1 c  Crumbled blue cheese
Just chop 1 cup of walnuts (depending on the size of brie you need to
cover) and stir into 1 cup crumbled blue cheese.  Press onto the top
of the brie and carefully wrap a sheet of thawed puff pastry dough
(Roll out to size needed).  Use fingers wet with cold water to seal
underside of pastry. Cut off excess to make cut-outs and adhere to
top of brie with a little cold water.  I refrigerate my brie at this
point until I'm ready to bake. Remove from fridge, Brush w/egg wash
(1 egg beaten with a Tbsp. cold water) and bake on a cookie sheet
covered with baking parchment in a 375 degree oven for about 20
minutes until golden. (Parchment makes it simple to transfer brie to
serving dish.) Let Baked Brie stand for 20-30 Min. before cutting to
let it firm up a little.
