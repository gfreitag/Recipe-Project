1 lg Pkg Day-old Hot Dog Buns
1 c  Butter; melted
2 tb Italian Seasonings
Slice hot dog buns into fourths lengthwise.  Dip bread in melted
butter and arrange on a large baking sheet. Mix spices and sprinkle
over bread sticks. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes or until
crunchy, but not brown. Serve hot or cold.  Let cool well before
covering. Stores well in air-tight containers. This was invented by a
friend to use up left-over buns from a weiner roast, but it is too
delicious to wait for left-overs. It is great with stew, spaghetti,
or by themselves for snacks!
