MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
2 ts Chili sauce
1 ts Sugar
2 tb Light soy sauce

Cut the bean curd into 1- x 1-1/2-inch flat pieces.  Deep-fry them in
hot oil for 2 to 2-1/2 minutes, until the surfaces are somewhat firm
and yellow.  Drain thoroughly.  Soak the mushrooms in boiling water
for half an hour.  Drain.  Discard the stems and cut the caps into
halves. Cut the onion into thin slices.  Break the broccoli into
individual florets and cut the stem into 1-inch wedges.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok.  When hot, add
the onion, ginger, broccoli stems, and mushrooms and stir-fry in the
hot oil for 2 minutes, to season the oil.  Add the broccoli and stock
and continue to stir-fry for 1-1/2 minutes, and then cook, covered,
for 1-1/2 minutes. Uncover the pan or wok, pour the sauce ingredients
over the contents, and continue to turn and stir-fry all ingredients
together for a further 1-1/2 minutes.  Serve with rice and other
dishes.
