DIRECTIONS: Torte: Melt broken chocolate in double boiler, stirring
constantly, or microwave on medium for about 3 minutes. Set aside. In
the small mixer bowl, cream butter, gradually adding 1/2 cup of the
sugar; mix until very fluffy. Add egg yolks, liqueur and vanilla;
beat until creamy. Transfer to larger bowl. Fold melted chocolate
into creamed mixture. Use a food processor or blender to chop pecans
to a coarse powder. Combine nuts with crumbs and fold into chocolate
mixture. Beat egg whites with salt, gradually adding remaining 1/4
cup sugar; beat until soft peaks form. Stir 1/4 of egg whites into
chocolate mixture; fold in remaining egg whites. Pour batter into a
buttered 9" springform pan lined with waxed paper. Bake at 350-F on
bottom rack for 45-50 minutes or until center is firm. Cool on rack.
Cake will sink slightly in the center. Remove pan and liner. Top with
Chocolate Ganache Glaze and Grand Marnier Whipped Cream Decoration.

Chocolate Ganache Glaze: Finely chop chocolate. Heat cream until hot.
On very low heat add chocolate, stirring until smooth and thick.
Remove from heat. Stir in liqueur. Turn torte, top side down, onto
serving plate. Arrange strips of waxed paper under cake edge to catch
excess glaze. Pour glaze over top and sides of cake. After a short
time, run excess glaze up sides of cake. Cover sides of cake with
nuts. Remove waxed paper strips. Chill cake while preparing topping.

Grand Marnier Whipped Cream Decoration: Whip cream with sugar and
liqueur until it holds a shape. Do not overbeat. Pipe rosettes or
form a ring of whipped cream around top of chocolate glazed torte.
With a sharp knife cut peel from orange. Slice into circles; cut into
quarters. Place oranges around cake on top of whipped cream. If
preferred, sprinkle grated orange rind over whipped cream. Cake
should be stored in a cool place until served.
