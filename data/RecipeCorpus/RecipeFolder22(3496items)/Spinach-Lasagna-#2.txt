Yield: 6 servings
-small florets, stalks
-finely chopped
1 lb Mushrooms; thinly sliced
2    Garlic cloves; minced
12    Curly lasagna noodles made
-w/o eggs
2 tb Olive oil
1 1/4 lb Spinach; well washed, stems

-recipe)
2 c  Tomato sauce

1 md Onion; finely chopped
2    Broccoli stalks; cut into
In a large pot of lightly salted boiling water, cook the lasagna
noodles just until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain well. Toss with 1
tablespoon of the oil to keep the noodles from sticking.

Meanwhile, put 1 inch of water into a large saucepan with a steamer
basket, cover with the lid, and bring to a gentle boil. Put the
spinach in the steamer basket, cover and steam until the spinach is
wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the spinach and rinse under cold
running water. Use your hands to squeeze the excess water from the
spinach.

In a large skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over
medium heat. Add the onion, broccoli, mushrooms, and garlic and cook
until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Add the spinach and
cook, stirring, until all the moisture has evaporated from the
spinach, about 2 minutes. Stir in the Tofu "cheese" sauce, and remove
from the heat.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly oil a 9- by 13-inch baking
dish. Place 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the baking dish, overlapping
them slightly. Spread with half the spinach filling. Top with 4 more
noodles, and spread with the remaining filling. Top with 4 more
noodles, and spread the remaining tomato sauce on top.

Bake until bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before
serving.
