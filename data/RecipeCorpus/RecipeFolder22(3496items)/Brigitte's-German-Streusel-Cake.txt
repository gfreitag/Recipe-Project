Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM------------------------FOR THE CAKE-----------------------------
2 ts Baking powder
1 1/4 c  Milk
1 lg Can drained fruit of choice
-or 1 cup fresh sliced fruit
3/4 c  Margarine
1/4 c  Sugar
2    Eggs

2 c  Flour
MMMMM------------------FOR THE STREUSEL TOPPING-----------------------
3/4 c  Margarine, cold, not soft
1 1/2 ts Cinnamon

For the Cake:

1. Cream sugar and margarine togther. Stir in eggs, and then alternate
stirring in the flour and the milk.

2. Grease and flour a small cookie sheet or sheet cake pan. Pour
batter in pan, spread to evenly coat. Top with fresh sliced fruit or
well-drained canned fruit.

For the Streusel Topping:

1. Mix flour, sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. Cut the margarine in small
pieces and drop in flour mixture. Mix together well -- the best way
is to mix it with your hands. Mix until all is a consistency of a
streusel topping. If it gets too dry, mix in a little more margarine.
If it gets too sticky, add a little more flour. Sprinkle over
cake/fruit mixture in cookie sheet/sheet cake pan.

Bake for 30-35 minutes at 350F.

Authors Notes: "In Berlin, Germany (where I was born) we make this
cake in the plum season and use fresh plums and omit the streusel and
just sprinkle with 1 cup of sugar on top of the still hot cake and
serve with whipped cream. You can use Cool Whip if you like! This
cake is always sold at bakesales in the Army. We just double the
recipe and cut it in squares and wrap it in saran wrap and at the
last sale it was gone in 30 minutes!"
