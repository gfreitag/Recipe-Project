Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 8 servings
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1 lg Bunch fresh parsley
1 ts Ground cloves
1/2 c  Coarse salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/2 c  ( 1 stick) butter
17 lb Tomatoes (1 peck)
1 c  Brown sugar
2 md Onions
1 c  All-purpose flour
2    Hungarian hot peppers

Core the tomatoes and chop them coarsely.  Chop the onions, peppers,
celery, and parsley coarsely, and divide equally, along with the
tomatoes, between 2 very large, deep kettles.  Divide the salt
between the 2 kettles, too.  Cover, bring to a boil, and simmer over
medium-low heat for 1 hour, or until all vegetables are very tender.
Stir frequently. Put mixture through a sieve or food mill.  Transfer
the puree to a large kettle. In a medium bowl, combine all remaining
ingredients except butter. Add the seasonings gradually to the hot
puree, beating in with a whisk. Add the butter and whisk smooth.
Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium low heat for 3 minutes.
Pour hot into 12 hot pint jars, leaving 1/2 inch head space.  Seal
and process in hot- water bath for 15 min.

To serve, add one 11 ounce can cream of mushroom soup and 1 soup can
of water to every pint of tomato soup base.  Heat and serve

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

NOTE:  You can also prepare the soup base by adding 1 1/2 cups milk
to it, or even using 1 1/2 cups water.
