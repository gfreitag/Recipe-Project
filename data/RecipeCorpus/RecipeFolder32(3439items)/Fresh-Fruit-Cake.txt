1 1/2 c  Orange juice
3/4 c  Sugar

1 ts Grated orange peel
1 ts Grated lemon peel
1/4 ts Salt (optional)

About 2 hours before serving or early in the day: Prepare fruit
sauce: In 2 qt saucepan over medium heat, mix orange juice, sugar,
cornstarch, orange peel, lemon peel and salt. Cook over medium heat,
stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils; boil 1 minute.
Cover saucepan and refrigerate about 1 hour or until mixture is
chilled. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375~. Line 15 1/2 x 10 1/2
jelly-roll pan (I use my roasting pan) with waxed paper; grease
paper. Prepare angel food cake mix as label directs, but spread
batter evenly in prepared jelly-roll pan. Bake cake 20 minutes or
until golden. Cover large wire rack with sheet of waxed paper. When
cake is done, with small spatula, loosen it from sides of pan; invert
onto waxed paper on rack. Lift off pan; peel off paper. Cool cake
completely, then return to clean jelly-roll pan or large tray. Cover
cake if not using right away. To serve: Spread top of cake with about
half of chilled fruit sauce. Slice peaches and strawberries. Arrange
peaches, strawberries, and blueberries on cake; brush fruit with
remaining fruit sauce. This cake is absolutely delicious and looks
very pretty with the different color fruit on top.
