1 c  Dry roasted peanuts; ground
-fine
1/3 c  Yellow cornmeal
4 1/2 tb Garlic; minced
1 tb Fresh ginger; minced
2    Stalks fresh lemongrass
1/2 ts Black pepper
12 tb Coarse salt
1 1/3 c  Rice flour
2 c  Buttermilk
3 1/2 lb Chicken; quartered
1/2 c  Distilled white vinegar
1 c  Sugar
2    4" dried hot red chilies
1 1/2 tb Nam pla (Thai fish sauce)
1/2 c  Water
Discard outer leaves of the lemongrass. Slice thin the bottom 4" and
mash to a paste in a mortar with pestle. In a shallow bowl, stir
together the peanuts, cornmeal, 2 Tbsp. of the garlic, gingerroot,
lemongrass, black pepper, salt and 1/3 cup of the flour. Have ready,
in 2 separate shallow bowls, the remaining 1 cup of flour and the
buttermilk. Dredge the chicken pieces well in the flour, shaking off
the excess, dip them in the buttermilk, letting the excess drip off,
and roll them in the peanut mixture, transferring them as they are
coated to an oiled shallow baking dish.
Bake the chicken, covered tightly with foil, in the middle of a
preheated 350F oven for 45 minutes, remove the foil carefully and
bake the chicken for 20 - 25 minutes more, or until golden (the
chicken will crisp as it cools). In a small saucpan combine the
vinegar, sugar, remaining 2 1/2 Tbsp. garlic, crushed red chilies,
nam pla and the water, bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer it
until it is reduced by half. Serve the chicken with the sauce.
