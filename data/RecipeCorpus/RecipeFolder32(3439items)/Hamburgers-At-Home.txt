Title: Hamburgers At Home
Categories: Meats, Sandwich
Yield: 1 recipe
Hamburger (1/4 pound per
-person
1 tb Oil
Use only ground round.  Allow 1/4 lb. per person.  Shape that much
into 2 thin patties (& I** use the lid to an 8 oz. margarine cup in
which to shape the patties). Press hamburger into lid evenly.  Makes
it very flat & uniform in size.  It drops right out when you bend the
lid a bit. Place each patty on a accomodating sqaure of waxed paper,
stacking these in a coffee can, with a tight fitting lid.  Preeze
them this way to use within 3 months, removing only as many patties
as you need at a time. Lightly oil a flat grill, the kind you would
ordinarily use for making pancakes. I have one that I use for nothing
else BUT hamburgers, which I spray in Pam when I've washed it each
time it is used, and store it in a plastic bag until I use it again.
Get the grill HOT and sear each patty quickly in about 1 Tablespoon
oil -- turning only once to sear the other side. Then depending on
the degree of doneness, adjust heat to medium-low for additional
cooking.  Do not use a skillet with collared sides or you'll trap in
vapors, moisture and you will be "frying" the hamburgers rather than
searing them, thus making the tough!
