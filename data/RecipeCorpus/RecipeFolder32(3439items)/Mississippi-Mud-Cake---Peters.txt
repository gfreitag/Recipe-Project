waxed paper to fit the bottom of the pan and butter it. With an
electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar together until light and
fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Add
the flour, cocoa, salt, vanilla and nuts, and beat again. Turn the
batter into the pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the
oven and cool on a rack. When cool, remove cake from pan and peel off
the waxed paper. Icing: Sift the sugar and cocoa together.  Beat in
the melted butter, vanilla, pecans, and milk. When smooth, spread the
icing over the cake. This cake is cracked and dry-looking, like
Mississippi mud in the hot, dry summer. NEW SOUTHERN COOKING by
