Cream shortening and sugar together well, and then add the egg and
flavorings. Stir in the oats and milk. Sift together the flour, salt
and soda and add to the creamed mixture. (You probably will have to
use your hands to work in the dry ingredients thoroughly!) Shape into
rolls, wrap in waxed paper or foil, and store in the refrigerator.
When ready to bake, slice thinly and bake on a greased cooky sheet at
375 degrees until lightly browned.
