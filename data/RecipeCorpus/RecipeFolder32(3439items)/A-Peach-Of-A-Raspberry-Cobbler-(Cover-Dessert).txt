The homey dessert on our cover is a favorite from our Test Kitchen. It
combines raspberries and peaches. A flaky, woven crust tops the fruit
filling.

1. For cobbler crust, in a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
Cut in shortening till mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually
pour in water and blend to form a dough. Divide into two portions of
one-third and two-thirds.

2. On waxed paper, pat or roll the larger portion of dough to form a
12-inch square. Fit into the bottom and up the sides of an 8x8x2-inch
baking dish. Trim pastry even with top of the dish.

3. In a large bowl, stir together the 1 1/2 cups sugar, cornstarch,
cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir in peaches and berries. Transfer to
pastry-lined baking dish. Dot with butter or margarine.

4. Roll remaining pastry into a 9x8-inch rectangle. Cut into eight
1-inch-wide strips. Arrange over raspberries in a lattice. Trim to
fit dish or tuck under bottom pastry.

5. Mix the yolk with the milk. Brush the mixture over pastry.
Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar.

6. Place on a baking sheet. Bake in a 375-F oven for about 60 minutes
or till crust browns, and filling is bubbly. Serve warm with cream or
ice cream. From: Sallie Krebs Date: 14 Jun 94
