Saute pheasant with shallots and butter. Flame it with brandy. Add
salt and pepper along with the bouillon to the pheasant. Cook in a
preheated 300 oven for half an hour, basting with the sauce
regularly. Combine cream, horseradish and vinegar, cook for fifteen
or twenty minutes longer. Just before it is finished, taste for
seasoning and add the peeled grapes to the sauce five minutes before
serving.
