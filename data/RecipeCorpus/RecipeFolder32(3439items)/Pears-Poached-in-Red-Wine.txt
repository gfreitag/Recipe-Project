Title: Pears Poached in Red Wine
Categories: Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
6 md Anjou, Bosc or other pears
1 sm Orange
6    Whole cloves
4 c  Dry red wine
1 c  Plus 2 tbs sugar
1/2 stick cinnamon
With a potato peeler, remove about half of the peel from the pears,
leaving vertical strips of peel intact and giving the fruit a striped
appearance. Stud the unpeeled orange with the cloves. Combine the
wine, sugar, cinnamon stick, and orange in a stock pot. Bring the
mixture to a boil and add the pears. Lower the heat to a simmer and
cook the pears for about 30 minutes or until they are tender. Cool
the mixture and chill the pears in the cooking liquid.

To serve, put 1 whole pear on each serving plate with 1-2 tbs of the
wine sauce around each pear.
