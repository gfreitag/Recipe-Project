Title: Gefilte Fish
Categories: Jewish, Fish
Yield: 12 servings
2 lb Whitefish
2 lb Pike
2 lb Winter carp
5    Onions
2 qt Water
4 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Pepper
3    Eggs
3/4 c  Ice water
1/2 ts Sugar
3 tb Matzo or cracker meal
3    Carrots -- sliced
Have the fish filleted but reserve the head, skin and bones.  You may
use any combination of fresh-water fish although this combination is
most popular.    Combine head, skin, bones and 4 sliced onions with 1
quart of water, 2 teaspoons salt and 3/4 teasp and pepper. Chop until
very fine; this is important for fluffy fish. Moisten hands; shape
mixture into balls. Carefully drop into fish stock. Add the carrots.
Cover loosely and cook over low heat 1 1/2 hours. Remove the cover
for the last 1/2 hour. Strain the stock over it, and arrange carrots
around it. Chill.  Serve with horseradish.    You can serve 12 people
generously but the fish keeps for a few days so you might as well
make this amount even for fewer people. Recipe Source: THE ART OF
