Frittata di Carciofi, II (Artichoke Omelette, Another Version)

Salt Freshly ground black pepper

1. Follow the procedure for the artichokes in the preceding recipe.

2. Saute the garlic and onion in 1 tablespoon olive oil until lightly
golden and remove.

3. Pre-heat the broiler. Beat the oregano into the egg mixture and
pour a little more than half into a preheated heavy skillet that has
been thoroughly greased with olive oil. Mix the artichokes, capers,
olives, onions, garlic and put 3/4 of this mixture on top of the
eggs, spreading evenly. Layer all but 5 slices of the tomato over the
vegetables. Pour the remaining egg mixture on top and stud with
reserved ingredients in an attractive pattern. Cook until eggs are
just set, then run under the broiler until just brown. Dust with a
little Pecorino cheese before browning if you wish. Serve with a
green salad, or a green bean salad.
