1. Heat the oil and butter in a heavy saucepan with high sides. Saute
the meat quickly over medium high heat, dust lightly with flour while
still in pan, turn over and add the garlic, rosemary, and sage. Cook
over medium low heat. Do not brown aromatics.

2. Add the vinegar and 1/2 cup water. Cook slowly, turning meat
often, for about 10 minutes.

3. Chop the anchovies finely, place in a bowl and add 2 or 3
tablespoons of the cooking juices. Mix well, add the drained capers
and stir. Pour over the meat and cook until the sauce is reduced to a
thick glaze-like consistency. Serve immediately. NOTE: This can be
used as a basting liquid for lamb chops cooked outdoors on the grill,
or for a slow-cooking leg of lamb.
