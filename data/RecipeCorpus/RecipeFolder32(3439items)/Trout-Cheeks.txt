Title: Trout Cheeks
Categories: Appetizers, Fish
Yield: 2 servings
4    Lake trout cheeks
1/4 c  Bearnaise sauce
1 ts Butter
1    Slice bread, toasted.
When cleaning lake trout [or other large fish] scoop out the scallop
shaped cheeks. Reserve until ready to prepare. Briefly pan fry or
stir fry them in a small skillet or poach in acidified water . Have
prepared a small quantity of Bearnaise sauce or flavored Beurre
Compose. Make toast points and serve the cheeks on toast covered in
the sauce. These are small but well worth the effort. [Walleye or
pickerel cheeks are even smaller and even tastier!]
