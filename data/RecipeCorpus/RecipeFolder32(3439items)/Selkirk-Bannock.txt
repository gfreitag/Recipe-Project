Categories: Scot/irish, Breakfast, Breads
Yield: 1 loaf
8 oz Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 oz Butter
1 1/2 oz Granulated sugar
1/4 pt Milk; warm
1/2 oz Fresh yeast
8 oz Sultanas
1    Egg; beaten to glaze
Butter a 1 Ib. loaf tin.  Dissolve the sugar in the milk and stir in
the yeast until thoroughly mixed. Leave in a warm place for 15
minutes. Meanwhile sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Add the
butter and rub in. Make a well in the centre and pour in the yeast
mixture. Mix together vigorously until it forms a soft dough. Turn on
to a floured surface. Knead gently and shape into a ball. Transfer to
a greased bowl, cover and leave to rise in a warm place for 30
minutes. Then work in the sultanas with the hands so they are evenly
distributed.  Re-form the dough ball and leave to rise for 30
minutes. Finally transfer to the tin; leave to rise for 45 minutes.
Brush with beaten egg.  Bake for 20 minutes in a pre-heated oven at
350Ã¸F or Mark 4 until golden in colour. Turn out to a wire rack to
cool. Serve sliced thinly and buttered.
