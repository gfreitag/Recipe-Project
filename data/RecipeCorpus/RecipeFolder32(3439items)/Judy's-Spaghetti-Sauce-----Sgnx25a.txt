1 lb Sausage -- ( sweet and/or

Put tomatoes through food mill.  Simmer onion and garlic in oil until
translucent.   Add cut up sausage. Cook until brown, stirring often.
Add sieved tomatoes, sauce and paste, rinsing tomato paste cans with
a little water to pick up any residue. Bring slowly to a soft boil.
Add bay leaves, basil, oregano, rosemary, parsley, salt pepper and
wine. Simmer. To make meatballs:  mix ground beef with eggs. Mixture
should be quite wet. Add cheese and bread crumbs. Form into
meatballs. (If you moisten your hands with water prior to rolling
between palms, it's  much easier!) Bake at 350 F.  on cookie Drain.
Add to sauce and heat through. Enjoy! Ron/MA FROM: RON SECOR, JR.
