Place the chicken breast, broth or water, bay leaf, and cumin in a
medium skillet.  Bring to boiling, reduce heat.  Simmer, covered, for
15 to 20 minutes or till chicken is tender and no longer pink. Drain,
reserving broth.  Let chicken stand till cool.  Use a fork to pull
chicken apart into long, thin strands.  Set aside.  Remove bay leaf
from broth. Stack tortillas and wrap tightly in foil.  Heat in a 350
deg oven for 10 minutes to soften. Meanwhile, in a large skillet cook
the chopped onion in hot oil till tender; but not brown. Carefully
add beans; jalapeno, serrano, or canned chili peppers; and 1/4 cup of
the reserved broth.  With a wooden spoon or potato masher, mash beans
in skillet (Mixture should be thick.) Remove from heat. Spread 2 to 3
tablespoons of the bean mixture down the middle of each tortilla. Top
each with some of the chicken; papaya or orange; shredded cheese; and
cilantro or parsley. Fold in the sides of each tortilla over the
filling, overlapping and forming a cone shape. Fasten with a
toothpick. Arrange the burritos on a baking sheet. Cover lightly with
foil. Bake in a 350 deg F oven for 15 to 20 minutes or till burritos
are heated through. If desired, serve with salsa and garnish with
cherry tomatoes and thyme sprigs. Source: Better Homes & Gardens,
