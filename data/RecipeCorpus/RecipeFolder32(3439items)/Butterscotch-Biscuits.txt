Title: Butterscotch Biscuits
Categories: Scot/irish, Breakfast, Breads
Yield: 1 batch
12 oz Flour; self-rising
4 oz Margarine
1/2 ts Salt
1    Egg
8 oz Brown sugar
1 ts Vanilla essence
Set oven to 350Ã¸F or Mark 4.  Grease a baking sheet. Melt the sugar,
margarine and vanilla essence together in a saucepan very gently over
a low heat.  Remove from the heat.  When the mixture has cooled add
the beaten egg and mix together. Sift the flour and salt into a bowl.
Make a well in the centre and pour in the cooled egg/fat/sugar
mixture. Knead into a stiff dough.  This will be fairly dry, but it
needs no extra moisture. Roll out the dough on a floured surface into
1/2 inch thickness and cut out the biscuits with a 2 inch biscuit
cutter.  Place on the baking sheet with sufficient space to allow
them to spread. Bake for 20 minutes until light golden in colour.
