Put soda in milk into flour, add melted butter and stir to mix. Beat
eggs with sugar; work them into the rest of the ingredients. Add
enough flour to make a stiff dough that can be rolled out. Roll, cut
and fry in hot lard; flavor with a little grated nutmeg.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
