: Sallie Krebs, Thu 06 Jul 95 04:00, Area: COOKING Cut pheasant,
which has been hung for four days, into serving pieces and remove
skin. Parboil the pheasant for twenty minutes, in just enough water
to cover the bird. Add a small onion thinly sliced, one bay leaf, two
cloves, one spring of thyme, one carrot thinly sliced and salt and
pepper to taste. Remove the pheasant pieces and reduce the stock over
a hot fire to one half its original quantity. Make twice as much
biscuit dough reserving half to make a fairly thick crust for the pie
and cutting the rest into small rectangles. Butter a deep dish and
line it with the slices of lean and trimmed ham. Arrange the pieces
of pheasant in the dish scattering among them the rectangles of
biscuit dough, four potatoes diced and a half pound of cooked button

mushrooms. Pour the reduced stock and two tablespoons of Madeira Wine
over the filling and add a bay leaf. Dot with butter and flour and
cover the pie with the biscuit dough, cutting a few slots in the
crust. Bake for one hour in a preheated 350 oven and serve hot with
wine jelly and lemon slices.
