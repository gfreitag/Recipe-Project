Title: SHRIMP FLORIDAN EN PAPILATE
Categories: Main dish, Seafood
Yield: 6 servings
48    Fresh shrimp (2 lbs)
8 oz Cream cheese
8 oz Blue cheese
8 oz Sour cream
2 tb Garlic;finely chopped
4 tb Parsley; finely chopped
1/2 c  Sauterne wine
6    Lemon wedges
6    Alum foil pieces 12/12"
Cook, peel & clean shrimp & let cool.  Blend together the cheeses &
sour cream, being careful to get a smooth and even mixture. Cheese
sauce will be thin.
Add the chopped garlic & parsley & mix well.  Add the wine. (A bit
more or less wine may be required to get the desired thickness of the
mixture.) Place about 4 oz. of the mixture on a piece of the foil;
add 8 shrimp (or more if you want) and top with a piece of lemon.
Fold over 2 sides of foil, then ends, so a tight package is formed to
prevent leaking. (You could use ramekins in place of foil) Bake in
oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes.   - The cheese sauce from
shrimp is delicious on baked potato! From Siples Garden Seat
