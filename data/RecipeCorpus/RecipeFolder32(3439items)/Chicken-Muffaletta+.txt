This recipe originated and is still presented at the Central Grocery
in New Orleans. The olive salad is usually heaped on layers of deli
meats and provolone. The cookbooks author (from whose cookbook I
typed out the recipe) prefers a chile rubbed breast of chicken,
grilled to perfection. She says "Sazerac anyone."

O.K. the recipe now-

1. Mix all the ingredients for olive salad in bowl. Cover and
refrigerate.

2. Dust chicken on both sides with chile powder and salt. Broil 2 to 3
minutes on each side until done but juicy.

3. Put leaf lettuce on bottom half of each roll. Top with a warm
chicken breast and lots of olive salad.

4. Cut the sandwich in half. Serve with carrot sticks and Cajun potato
chips.
