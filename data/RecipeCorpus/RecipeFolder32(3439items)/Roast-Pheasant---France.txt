Salt & pepper to taste string to truss

Melt one tbs of the butter and add garlic and thyme. Pour this inside
the pheasant, truss the legs and wings close to the body with the
string. Sprinkle the pheasant inside and out with salt and pepper,
brush with the remaining butter and roast in a moderately, preheated
375 oven for one and a half hours. Baste often to prevent drying and
to brown.
