Put the tangerine and liver into the pheasant cavity and lace the
opening tightly and lard the bird. In a skillet melt the lard and
roll the pheasant in it, pat it all over, raise the flame and cook
the bird for fifteen minutes, until brown on all sides. Transfer the
pheasant to a large casserole and keep hot.

In the fat remaining in the skillet, cook the mushrooms and add them
to the casserole. In a sauce pan add butter and melt, combine the
shallots and flour, blend over the low flame but do not brown. Add
the Marsala, salt and pepper and fennel. Add the sauce to the
pheasant along with the juniper berries. Cover the casserole and set
in a preheated 350 oven for thirty five minutes. Serve in the
casserole.
