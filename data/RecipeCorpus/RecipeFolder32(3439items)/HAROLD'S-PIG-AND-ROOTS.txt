1. Have your market trim pork of fat, then bone, roll, and tie the
meat, saving the bones (or do this yourself).
2. Place meat in a 5-6 quart ovenproof pan on medium-high heat. Turn
often until meat is well browned all over, about 10 minutes. Add
stock, sage, and lemon juice; stir to scrape browned bits from pan.
Cover very tightly and bake in a 325'F. oven for 1 hour.
3. Add carrots and potatoes to meat. Cover and bake until vegetables
are barely tender when pierced, about 20 minutes. Add turnips and
parsnips; cover and bake until all vegetables are tender when
pierced, about 40 minutes longer.
4. When vegetables are done, place cabbage in a 10-12" frying pan
with 1/2" water. Bring water to boiling over high heat, cover, and
simmer until cabbage is tender when pierced, about 10 minutes.
5. Transfer meat and vegetables to a large platter; keep warm. Skim
fat from pan juices; bring juices to a boil over high heat. Add
cornstar mixed with 1/3 cup water and bring to a second boil,
stirring. Pour into a small pitcher. Slice meat and serve with
vegetables; add gravy and salt and pepper to taste.

*** RICH PORK STOCK ***
1. Place reserved pork bones in a 10x15" pan with onions and carrots.
Roast in a 450'F. oven, mixing occasionally, until bones are well
browned, 40-50 minutes.
2. Add 1/2 cup water to pan; stir vigorously to free browned bits.
Scrape mixture into a 5-6 quart pan. Add 1 quart water, celery, and
thyme. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover and simmer for 1
1/2 hours.
3. Uncover pan and boil over high heat until liquid is reduced to 2
1/2 cups, about 10 minutes. Pour mixture through a fine strainer into
a bowl. Discard bones and vegetables. If stock is made ahead, cool,
cover, and chill up to 2 days. Skim or lift off fat and discard.
