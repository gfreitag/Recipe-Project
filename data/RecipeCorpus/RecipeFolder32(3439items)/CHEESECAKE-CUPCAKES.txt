Title: CHEESECAKE CUPCAKES
Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
8 oz Cream cheese, softened
2    Eggs
3/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Vanilla
18    To 24 vanilla wafers
1 c  Sour cream
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
Whip together the cream cheese and 3/4 cup sugar.  Add the eggs, lemon
juice and vanilla. Using foil liners only in muffin tin (don't use
paper or paper inserts!), put 1 vanilla wafer in bottom of each
liner. Put in 2 Tbsp. of cream cheese mixture on top of wafer in each
liner. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 15-20 minutes. Center
will sink a little when taken out of oven.

Meanwhile, blend together sour cream, 2 Tbsp. sugar and 1 tsp.
vanilla in a bowl.  Top baked "cupcakes" with this sour cream blend.
Or, instead of using the sour cream blend, can top with cherry pie
filling, other types of filling or grated chocolate.  Refrigerate.

Note:  My "cupcakes" actually needed to bake about 30 minutes.  I
doubled this recipe and came out with exactly 36 cupcakes.  I used
one can of blueberry pie filling and the sour cream recipe above as
is.  But, on the cupcakes I used the sour cream on, after letting
them cool for 15 minutes, I put the sour cream on and popped them
back in the oven for 5 minutes. The ones I used the fruit on, I let
them cool for 15 minutes before topping them. - Debbie
