Title: Shortcrust pastry (pate brisee)
Categories: Pastry, French
Yield: 1 recipe
1 c  (heaping) Flour
1    Egg
3/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Sugar
5 2/3 oz Butter; diced and slightly
-- softened
1 tb Milk
Put the flour on a marble or wooden surface and make a well in the
centre. Put in egg, salt, sugar and diced butter and rub the
ingredients together with the fingertips of your hand, drawing the
flour into the well with the other hand. When everything is almost
completely mixed, add the mild and knead the dough 2 or 3 times with
the heel of your hand to make it smooth, but do not overwork it.

Wrap the dough in clingfilm or greaseproof paper and leave to rest in
the fridge for several hours before using. It will keep in the fridge
for 3 or 4 days, or for several weeks in the freezer.
