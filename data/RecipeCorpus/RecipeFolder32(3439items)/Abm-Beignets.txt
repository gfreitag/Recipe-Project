Yield: 24 servings
1 c  Water
1    Egg
2 tb Oil
3 tb Nonfat dry milk powder
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1 ts Salt
3 1/2 c  Bread flour
2 1/2 ts Yeast
1/2 c  Powdered sugar
Place all ingredients except sugar in machine.  Program for knead and
first rise and press start.  The dough will be sticky at first but
will hold its shape.  After the final cycle, it will be workable.
When dough is finished, turn the dough out onto a floured surface and
let it rest for 10 minutes.  Roll the dough to a generous 1/4" thick
and cut it into 2" squares.  Cover the squares with a clean towel and
let rise for 30 minutes. Add the powdered sugar to a medium size
clean paper bag.  Lay out paper towels to drain to donuts.  Heat 1 to
1 1/2 " of oil to 375.  Do not add too many add once or it may cool
the oil too much.  Gently brush the uncooked squares to remove any
extra flour.  Side them into the heated oil. When they pop to the
surface, spoon the hot oil over them constantly until they are
puffed. Turn the squares and cook until they are a light golden color
on both sides.  It should take 1 to 2 minutes.  Cut the first couple
of squares in half to be sure there is not sticky uncooked dough
inside. Remove from hot oil with slotted spoon and drain on paper
towels. While warm, drop them, 3 or 4 at a time, into the bag with
powdered sugar and shake until they are well coated.  Serve
immediately.
