Beat egg or egg yolks with a rotary beater until slightly thick; add 1
teaspoon oil at a time beating well after each addition, until 1/3
cup has been added. Add a few drops lemon or vinegar. The mixture
should be quite thick and perfectly smooth. If it isn't you added the
oil too quick or didn't beat it enough. Continue to add the oil and
acid alternately until it's used up. Add seasonings to taste. Store
covered in the refrigerator.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
