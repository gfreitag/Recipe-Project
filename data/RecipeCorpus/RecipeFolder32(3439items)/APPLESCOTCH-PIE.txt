Title: APPLESCOTCH PIE
Categories: Pie/tart, Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
5 c  Apples (tart); (note below)
-peeled and thinly sliced
1 c  Brown sugar; firmly packed
1/4 c  Water
1 tb Lemon juice
1/4 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Granulated sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
3 tb Butter or margarine
2    Pie crust shells (9");
-unbaked
Mix together the apples, brown sugar water and lemon juice in a
2-quart saucepan. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer 7-8
minutes or JUST until apples are tender.

Mix together the flour, granulated sugar and salt; stir into apple
mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils.
Boil and stir 1 minute; remove from heat. Stir in the vanilla and
butter or margarine; cool.

Preheat oven to 425-degrees. Prepare pastry (or use store-bought).
Turn apple mixture into pastry-lined pie plate. Cover with top crust
in which you've cut slits; flute the edges. Cover edge of pie crust
with foil (or cut out an aluminum pan--keeping just the edge) to
prevent excessive browning; remove foil during the last 15 minutes of
baking. Bake 40-45 minutes or until crust is golden brown.

Note: I've found that ANY recipe calling for tart apples, you get more
flavor by mixing the types of apples. As we have an abundance of
varied apples,

Fuji's, Granny Smith and Gala's...they all vary in flavor, texture,
etc. Experiment with your favorite
