until beans are soft, adding additional water when necessary during
cooking.  Add 1/2 cup bacon drippings, salt and garlic.  Cook at
least 1 hour more, stirring occasionally. Can be cooked for more than
4 hours or overnight if there is enough water or using a slow cooker.
To re-fry the beans: Place beans in heavy fry pan, stir frequently,
until beans are reheated. Mash with a fork or potato masher.  Brown
beans until dry and a little crusty, stirring frequently.  Add salt,
if needed, to taste. Note: Bacon drippings or lard give the best
flavor, but for those concerned with cholesterol levels, vegetable
oil may be substituted. If desired, one or more of the following may
be added to beans during frying. :    Grated cheese to taste
:    Chopped chiles
:    Diced onion
:    Crisp, crumbled bacon If beans become too thick, thin with a
little milk.
