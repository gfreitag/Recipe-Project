Title: Paint Lick Country Fried Rabbit and Gravy
Categories: Game
Yield: 1 servings
2    Young rabbits
2    Egg yolks, slightly beaten
1 c  Buttermilk
1 c  Flour
1/4 c  Yellow cornmeal
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Lard
1 1/16 c  Milk
1 ts Pepper
Salt to taste
Wash rabbit and thoroughly disjoint. Combine yolks and buttermilk,
gradually add 3/4 cup of the flour, cornmeal, and salt. Beat until
smooth. Heat lard in a frying pan to 360 degrees.

Dip rabbit in batter and fry in lard, 7 minutes on each side. Reduce
heat to 275 degrees and cook, turning frequently, until rabbit is
tender, about 30 more minutes. Remove rabbit and drain on brown
paper. Pour off all but 2 teaspoons of lard in pan. Over medium heat
slowly stir remaining 1/4 cup of flour into lard, scraping up pieces
of crust from bottom of pan. When smooth, gradually stir in milk.
Bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until gravy is smooth
and thickened, about 3 minutes. Add a little more milk if gravy seems
too thick. Remove from heat, add pepper, then salt to taste. Pour
into a pitcher and serve with rabbit.
