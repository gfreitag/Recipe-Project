Categories: Romanian, Appetizers
Yield: 1 servings
2 x  Pigs feet
1 tb Salt
1 x  Garlic clove
1 x  Onion, partially peeled
1 x  Carrot
1 ts Black pepper, whole
Cut pigs feet in half, singe and scrape until clean. Place in pot and
cover with cold water, add salt and bring to a boil. Skim the foam
and reduce heat, simmer gently for 1 hour. Add onion, carrot, and
whole black pepper. Cover and boil gently until the meat is so well
cooked that it comes off easily from the bones. When cooked remove
all meat and bones and vegetables from the broth. Strain the broth
through a cheesecloth several times. Remove meat from bones and place
in loaf pan or a bowl that is not too deep. Then put the broth on to
heat again and when it starts to boil add garlic that has been mashed
with salt, allow to cook together for about 5 min. and strain again
thru cheese cloth. Pour the broth over meat and chill until firm.
Scrape any remaining fat off, sprinkle with paprika. Submitted By
