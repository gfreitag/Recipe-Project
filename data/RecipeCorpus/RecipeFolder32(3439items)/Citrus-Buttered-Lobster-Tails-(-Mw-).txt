Title: Citrus Buttered Lobster Tails ( Mw )
Categories: Microwave, Seafood
Yield: 1 servings
8 oz (1) Frozen Lobster Tail
1/4 c  Water
2 tb Butter Or Margarine
1 1/2 ts Lemon Juice
1/4 ts Finely Shredded Orange Peel
Dash Salt
Dash Ground Ginger
Dash Paprika
Place lobster tail in shallow baking dish.  Micro-cook, covered, on
30% power about 5 minutes or till thawed, rotating dish a
quarter-turn once. The tail is thawed when the shell is flexible
enough to bend. Using a heavy knife, cut through the center of the
top shell. Continue cutting through meat, but not through undershell.
Spread the tail open, butterfly-style, so meat is on top. Return to
shallow baking dish. Pour water atop. Micro-cook, covered, on 50% of
power for 5 to 7 minutes or just till meat is opaque, rotating dish a
quarter-turn every minute. (Shield cooked meat with small pieces of
foil, if necessary, to prevent overcooking.) Let stand covered for 5
minutes.  Meanwhile, combine butter or margarine, lemon juice, orange
peel, salt, ginger, and paprika. Micro-cook, uncovered, on 100% power
for 30 to 45 seconds, or till butter is melted. Mix well. Drizzle
lobster tail with butter mixture.
