This came from _New Recipes for Young Vegetarians_ by Sammy Green
Lentils take about one hour to cook from dry, but they freeze well,
so make a big bunch of them at once.  This recipe came out kind of
crumbly, but that might have been a fluke, as this was the first time
I'd made it. :)

For Vegan, the _Moosewood Cookbook_ by Mollie Katzen has a
"Lentil-Walnut Burger" recipe on page 147
