Categories: Main dish, Seafood, Thai, Asian
Yield: 6 servings
-Gail Shimizu BWHT68A
2 lb Whole red snapper or
-white fish
1 ts Galanga; finely chopped
1/2 tb Lemon grass; *
6    Medium fresh red chilies
2 tb Red onions; chopped

1 ts Kaffir lime leaves;

1/2 c  Basil leaves,

(Thai Steamed Fish with Basil)

* Sliced thinly-crosswise (use the base only, about 2 or 3 inches
from the root)

DIRECTIONS: Chop coarsely--the Galanga, lemon grass, onions, chilies
and soy beans in a blender or food processor (add a tbsp of water if
necessary). Wash, clean and pat dry the fish well. Cut 3-4 deep slits
crosswise on both sides and cover with the spice mixture pushing the
mixture into the slits. Place the dressed fish in a platter deep
enough to accommodate extra liquid when the fish is cooked.
Place the platter in the steamer. Sprinkle basils and Kaffir lime
leaves. Place 2 pieces of paper towels over the top but not on the
fish to catch any excess moisture while steaming. Cover and steam
over high heat for 20 minutes or until fish is fully cooked. Serve
immediately with cooked rice.
NOTE: All the listed ingredients can be found in any Thai grocery
stores.
