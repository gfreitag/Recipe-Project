Title: Plain Oven Scones
Categories: Scot/irish, Breakfast, Breads
Yield: 1 batch
8 oz Flour; self-rising
2 oz Butter
1 ts Caster sugar
1/2 pt Buttermilk, full cream
- milk or sour milk
pn Salt
Set oven to 450Ã¸F or Mark 8.  Grease and flour a baking sheet. Sift
the dry ingredients into a bowl and rub in the butter. Add sufficient
of the milk to make a moist and spongy dough.  Turn out on to a
floured surface and knead gently. Roll out to 1/2 inch thickness and
cut into rounds with a 2 1/2 inch pastry cutter.  Place on the baking
sheet. Brush the tops with milk and bake for 8 to 10 minutes until
risen and light golden in colour. Cool on a wire rack.  Serve split
in half with butter and jam. For rich scones add 1 beaten egg to the
dry ingredients before adding sufficient milk. Brush the tops of the
scones with beaten egg rather than with milk.
