MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------

1 c  Frozen peas
2 tb Oil

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1    Egg -- beaten with:
1 tb Water
Place all dough ingredients in machine and program for knead and first
rise.  Press start.  The dough will be quite firm but it should be
moist enough to hold together.  Make the filling while the dough is
rising. Place the potato cubes in a small saucpan and cover with
water.  Bring to a boil over medium high heat, lower the heat to
medium and continue cooking for 10 minutes, or until they have
slightly softened but are not cooked through. Add the peas to the
boiling water for the last minute of cooking. Drain the water from
the potato cubes and peas.  Heat the oil in a large frying pan set
over medium high heat and add the onions, garlic and ginger. Saute
until the onions are translucent.  Add the potato cubes, peas,
coriander, cumin, pepper and salt and stir until well mixed. Remove
from the heat and cool slightly.  Turn the finished dough out on a
lightly floured surface and divide it into 8 equal balls.  Let the
balls rest 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 with the rack in the
center position. Lightly spray a large baking sheet with Pam.  On a
lightly oiled work surface, roll each ball of dough to a 7" circle,
rolling from the middle toward the edge. Distribute the filling
evenly among the circles, about 3 heaping tbsp for each one. Lightly
moisten the edge of each circle with water and fold over to form a
semicircle.  Press the edges together firmly. Fold the pressed edge
inward toward the filling and press with you fingertips to seal. Lift
the samosas onto the prepared baking sheet and generously brush the
tops with the egg glaze.  Bake the samosas for 15 minutes, or until
they are a rich golden brown.  Serve hot from the oven.
