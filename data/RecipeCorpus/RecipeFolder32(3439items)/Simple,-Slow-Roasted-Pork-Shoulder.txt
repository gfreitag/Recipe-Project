Slow roasting results in tender, juicy pork. Turkey, lamb, beef or
veal can be roasted similarly.

PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Oil or butter pork all over. Season fatty outer
layer with salt and pepper. Place pork on a roasting rack in a pan.
Place pan in center of preheated oven and roast, uncovered. Roast for
30 minutes per pound or until the internal temperature at the
thickest point reaches 155F. (NOTE: Cover loosely with foil and allow
to "rest" for at least 15 minutes before carving.
