capsicums into four lengthways, remove seeds and white membrane.
Brush outer skin with oil and place skin down on hot barbecue until
skins are well blistered, rub skins off with a towel.  Arrange on
plates, alternating colours.  Drizzle with half of the dressing and
set aside. Heat barbecue to medium heat.  Place Octopus on the
barbecue plate and cook for 15-20 minutes, turning frequently and
splashing on a little marinade as they cook.  Remove and pile into
the centre of the pepper salad. Pour over remaining dressing and
serve with fresh garden salad.
