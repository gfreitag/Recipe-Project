Description:

Hot from the fry pan in a crisp and cheesy coating, Salmon steaks are
especially nice matched with a cool and tangy make-ahead sauce.

Instructions:

Salmon steaks: Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan, and seasonings. Place
seasoned crumbs on a large flat plate. Pour beaten egg onto second
plate. Dip salmon in beaten egg and then in seasoned bread crumbs,
pressing firmly. Refrigerate coated steaks 1/2 hr. to help coating
adhere. Heat frying pan and butter and oil. When butter melts, fry
steaks for 10 min. per inch of thickness, turning once halfway
through cooking period. Place on paper towel to remove excess oil.
Serve immediately with honey lime sauce if desired.

Honey Lime Sauce: Combine all ingredients until smooth. Spoon into
serving dish. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to serve. Garnish
with twist of lime.
