Wrap pheasant pieces, (which have been seasoned) in vine leaves, tie
them with string. Place the pheasant pieces in an earthenware
casserole or sauce pan closely packed with a quarter pound of butter,
one tablespoon of flour and a little more seasoning. Cover tightly
and seal the lid with a bond of paste. Place casserole in a preheated
350 oven for thirty or forty minutes, do not uncover until ready to
serve. A potato puree is generally eaten with this dish.
