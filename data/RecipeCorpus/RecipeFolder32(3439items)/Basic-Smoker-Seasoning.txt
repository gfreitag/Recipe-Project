Title: Basic Smoker Seasoning
Categories: Bbq/grill, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
This multipurpose seasoning
-can often be used to
-prepare
Meat or poultry for smoking.
Quite apart from its functions in smoke cookery, the Basic Seasoning
serves for almost any purpose in the kitchen where plain salt and
pepper are being used, and gives a great improvement of flavor. 1 lb.
10 oz. table salt 1 Tbsp    onion salt 2 Tbsp celery salt 1 Tbsp
garlic salt 2 Tbsp paprika 4 Tbsp    black pepper 4 Tbsp white pepper
2 Tbsp dill salt 3 Tbsp monosodium glutamate 4 Tbsp white sugar Mix
thoroughly, store in a covered jar in a dry place, let it stand at
least several days-the longer the better-before use. Other notes: For
spicier flavor, 1 Tbsp. of mace and/or nutmeg may be added. For a
hotter mixture, add 1 Tbsp of curry powder and/or dry mustard.
