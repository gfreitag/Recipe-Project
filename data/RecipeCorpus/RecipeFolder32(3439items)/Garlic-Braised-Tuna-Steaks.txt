Make small slits in the tuna steaks with a knife and insert a sliver

High. Drop in 1T butter and the peeled onions.  Heat for 1-2 minutes
on High, stirring occasionally, until the onions begin to brown. Pour
in the water and wine. Transfer the contents of the browning dish to
a large casserole. Add the bay leaf and fish to the casserole, cover
loosely and cook for 5 minutes on High.  Remove the fish and onions
from the casserole and keep them warm. Melt 1T butter in small, deep
bowl for 30 seconds on High. Stir in the flour and cook for 1-2
minutes on High or until flour is lightly browned. Pour in the
cooking liquid from the fish, and add the tomato paste and thyme.
Cook for 2-3 minutes on High, stirring occasionally until thickened.
Add the parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper, and set aside with the
fish.  Melt the remaining butter in a small casserole on High for 30
seconds.  Put in the spinach, cover loosely and cook for 1-2 minutes
on High.  Spread the spinach onto a serving plate and combine the
fish and sauce to re-heat for 30 seconds on High. Arrange the fish
and onions on top of the bed of spinach and pour the sauce over to
serve.
