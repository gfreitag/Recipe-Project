This is pronounced  fay-oh-ah-da. 1. Cover beans with cold water and
soak overnight, or cover them with boiling water and let stand for 2
hours; drain. 2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large dutch oven,
combine all ingredients. Bring to a boil, skimming if necessary.
Cover and transfer to oven. 3. Bake for 1-1/2 hours; remove cover and
bake for 30 minutes longer, stirring occasionally. Allow to cool
slightly, then cover and refrigerate overnight. 4. Remove any fat
from surface. Reheat the feijoada slowly.
