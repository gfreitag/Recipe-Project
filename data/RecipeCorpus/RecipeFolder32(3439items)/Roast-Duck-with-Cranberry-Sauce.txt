rack and set in shallow roasting pan. Roast at 350 degrees for 30
minutes Pierce skin all over with fork to release fat.

scraping up any browned bits. Add butter and heat until melted. Add
flour, stirring until smooth.

Add chicken broth and whisk constantly until smooth and thickened, 2
to 3 minutes. Stir in orange juice and 2 tbs. brown sugar and mix
well. Add cranberries and cook over high heat until cranberries pop,
2 to 3 minutes. Add cayenne and more salt and pepper to taste. If
mixture is too tart, add remaining brown sugar.

To serve, cut duck in half lengthwise using poultry shears and
place on two serving dishes. Pour half of sauce over each serving.
Serve immediately.
