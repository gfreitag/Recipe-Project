The snipe is to be roasted, but left undone. All meat is then removed
and finely chopped. At this time add the truffles, chopped up. The
mixture is then cooked in butter and the eggs are added for flavor.
The pheasant is then stuffed and cooked in a casserole with butter
for forty five minutes. A little brandy and game stock poured over
the top makes this recipe ideal for any hungry family.
