Title: Sen. Ellender's Basic Sauce
Categories: Game, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
5 tb Fat (veg/smoked bacon)
1 tb Flour, rounded
2 lb Onions, finely chopped
3 ea Celery stalk, chop fine
1 ea Bell pepper, med, chop fine
1 ea Lemon, grated rind and pulp
3 ea Garlic cloves, minced
2 ea Bay leaves
1 x  Salt to taste
1 x  Thyme, dash
1 x  Tabasco, dash
1 x  Worcestershire, few dashes
1 x  Season-All, few dashes
To the hot fat add flour, stirring constantly, to make a
scorchy-tasting roux. Add onions; fry slowly until thoroughly browned
and reduced to pulp. Add rest of ingredients at one time and continue
to cook slowly for at least 30-45 min. This recipe constitutes the
Basic Sauce for gumbos, stews, jambalayas and sauce picuante. If
thicker sauce is desired, make the roux with 2 to 4 Tbsp flour
instead of one. THIS SAUCE will be used in Sen. Ellender's shrimp
creole, jambalaya, chicken sauce picuante, courtbouillon and gumbo.
Suggestions: Make lots of sauce and freeze individual use portions.
