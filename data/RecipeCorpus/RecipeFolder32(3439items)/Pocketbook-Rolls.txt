In a small bowl, combine yeast and 1/2 cup warm water, stir, and set
aside.

In a large mixing bowl, cream the shortening, 1/4 cup room-temperature
butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed.  Then
gradually beat in the 1/2 cup boiling water (the butter and
shortening will melt). Add yeast mixture and stir until well blended.
Add egg and stir until well blended.  Sift in flour, add salt, and
stir to mix well.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and chill
until ready to use.  The dough will be soft.  (The mixture will keep
up to 1 week in the refrigerator.)

Three hours before ready to use, pat dough on a floured surface to
1/2 inch thickness and cut into 2 to 2-1/2-inch rounds with a biscuit
cutter. Fold each round in half and place on a large greased baking
sheet. Brush each roll with melted butter, cover with a towel and let
rise in a warm place about 2-1/2 hours.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake the rolls 15 minutes or until
golden brown.  Makes about 20.
