combine the heated beer, sugar, salt and melted butter with the yeast
mixture. Add the eggs, sage, thyme, savory, grated onion and 4 cups
of the flour and beat until the mixture is smooth.  Add enough
remaining flour until the mixture becomes difficult to beat.  Turn
dough out onto a lightly floured board and begin kneading, adding
enough of the remaining flour so that the dough does not stick to
your hands or the board. Continue to knead until the dough is smooth
and elastic. Place the dough in a oiled bowl, cover it with a damp
cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. About 1 1/2
hours. When the dough has risen, punch it down and let it rest for 10
~ 15 minutes.  Divide the dough in two pieces and shape each one into
a round loaf.  Place each in a loaf pan and let rise until double.
Bake the loaves in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes. Remove
the loaves from pans, and let cool on wire racks. This bread should
be served slightly warm. You may also freeze the loaves and reheat as
needed. This dough also makes wonderful dinner rolls or hamburger
buns Makes 2 loaves
