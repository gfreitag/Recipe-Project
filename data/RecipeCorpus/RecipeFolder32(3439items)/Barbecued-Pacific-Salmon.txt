Title: Barbecued Pacific Salmon
Categories: Bbq/grill, Information, Seafood
Yield: 1 salmon
1    Whole salmon
Description:

Savour the smoky flavour of whole barbequed salmon.  Here's an easy
handling technique.  Summer garden stuffing is a wonderful Salmon
stuffing.

Instructions:

Rinse salmon under cold running water and pat dry inside and out.
Sprinkle the cavity with salt, pepper, and lemon juice.  If desired
stuff lightly, skewer and lace closed.  Rub generously with softened
butter. Tear off double thickness of heavy duty foil as long as and
at list twice the width of the salmon.  Oil one side.  Punch numerous
pencil holes through the foil.  Over hot coals, place foil flat on
grill, oiled side up. Place salmon on foil.  Measure at thickest
point, allow 12 to 15 min. per inch total cooking time.  Halfway
through the cooking time, gather long edges of foil together to form
a "handle". Grip handle, flip salmon, reopen foil for rest of cooking
time. Fork test for doneneess along both sides of the backbone at
thickest point. Juices should run clear and flesh should be opaque.
