Title: VEGAN: Bread Pudding
Categories: Vegetarian, Puddings
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Grated apples
Juice of 1 lemon
4 c  Whole grain bread, cubed,
-small
1/3 c  Raisins
1 ts Cinnamon
1 1/2 c  Soymilk
1/2 c  Maple syrup
Some vanilla if you use
-plain soymilk
Egg replacer to equal
-one egg
Mix lemon juice with grated apple. Blend the soymilk, egg replacer,
maple syrup and cinnamon (and vanilla, if you use it) together. Put
one third of the bread in the bottom of a greased 8" by 8" baking
dish and cover with 1 cup of the apples and half the raisins.  Pour
one cup of the liquid mixture over these ingredients.  Repeat the
layers of bread, apple and raisins, ending with a top layer of bread.
Pour the rest of the liquid ingredients over it.  Sprinkle with
cinnamon. Let pudding sit for a few minutes (original recipes called
for 20 minutes, I let it sit for 5). Bake, covered, at 350 degrees F
(325 if you use a glass dish) for 45 minutes. Let stand for 10 to 20
minutes at room temperature before serving. Was great for breakfast.

Notes: I used a whole wheat cinnamon raisin bread, which combined
with the vanilla soymilk and maple syrup made it fairly sweet, which
I like but others might not. The orginal recipe called for margerine
to be dotted on top before baking. I cut it out because of fat
considerations, but I guess it would make the top crisper. Heavily
adapted from a recipe in the original Laurel's Kitchen.  It creates a
soft, moist, but yummy pudding. This was my first attempt to veganize
a baked recipe, and I think it turned out fairly well. Debbie
