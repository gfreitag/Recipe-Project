1 c  Blanched almonds
1 1/3 c  Granulated sugar
2/3 c  Light-brown sugar; packed
1/3 c  Honey
1/3 c  -cold water
6 tb Butter
1    Lemon; cut in half
1. Preheat oven to 300F. Butter inside of 9", 10-cup decorative
mold; or use a 10-cup bowl. Grease a large cookie sheet. On another
cookie sheet, toast almonds until golden brown - about 20 minutes. In
blender or food processor, grind almonds (makes 1 1/2 cups).
2. In a heavy, 3-quart saucepan, combine granulated sugar, brown
sugar, honey and water. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until
sugar is dissolved.
3. Cook, uncovered and without stirring, to 300F on candy
thermometer, or until a few drops of syrup in cold water form hard,
brittle threads.
4. Remove from heat; add butter and ground almonds.
5. Pour into prepared cookie sheet. Using the 2 lemon halves and
working quickly, smooth out and push from the center to the edge of
the cookie sheet until the brittle is 1/8" thick.
6. Lift brittle off the sheet before it is completely cooled and
hardened, and mold it against the inside of prepared mold.
7. Cool completely - about 2 hours. Unmold just before it is to be
served.
8. To unmold: With spatula, carefully loosen candy from pan; remove.
Makes 1 large bell.
Note: Leftover pieces can be kept in a closed jar at room
temperature, or wrapped in aluminum foil.
