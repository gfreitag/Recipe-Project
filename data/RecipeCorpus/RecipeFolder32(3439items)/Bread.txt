BREAD DIRECTIONS: Add flour, milk, the nuts, egg, sugar, margarine or
butter, liqueur, yeast, and salt to the bread machine according to the
manufacturer's directions.  Bake and cool as directed.  When brread is
cool, drizzle with Amaretto Glaze.

AMARETTO GLAZE: In a small mixing bowl combine sugar, amaretto or
hanelnut liqueur *OR* almond extract.  If needed, add 1 to 2
teaspoons milk to make of drizzling consistency.

BREAD MACHINE BASICS: These helpful tips apply to all types of bread
machines: Bread flour, which is high in protein, works best for
breads made in a bread machine.  You can use other grains or flours
with the bread flour but not in place of all of it.  Some recipes
also call for a small amount of gluten flour.  This helps breads,
especially those made with low-gluten flours (such as whole wheat
flour), hold together.

Add ingredients to the bread machine in the order specified by the
directions in the owner's manual.

To use powdered milk instead of fresh, add 1/3 cup nonfat dry milk
powder for each 1 cup of water and add it with the flour.  Always use
powdered milk when using the timer on your machine.

included with the recipe, and I thought it unfair to leave it off.
