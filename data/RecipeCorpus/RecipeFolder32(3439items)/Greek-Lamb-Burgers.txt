To make yogurt-cucumber sauce: In a medium-sized bowl, stir together
all ingredients. To make lamb burgers: In a small skillet, heat oil
over low heat. Add pine nuts and saute until they begin to color,
about 30 seconds. Add garlic, and saute until light golden, about 30
seconds longer. Turn the mixture out onto a small plate and let cool.
Prepare a grill or preheat the broiler. In a meat grinder or food
processor using an on/off motion, grind lamb. In a large bowl, moist
Grill or broil the patties on a lightly oiled rack until browned and
cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Tuck the patties into pitas
and top with yogurt-cucumber sauce. Serves 4. COMMENTS: Because you
grind the lamb yourself (a food processor does the job nicely), you
can guarantee that the meat is the lean portion from the leg. 355
