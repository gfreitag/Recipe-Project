In large mixing bowl, sift together flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking
powder and salt.  Add onions, milk, water, oil and egg; stir just
long enough to blend ingredients.

In deep-fat fryer or deep cast-iron skillet, heat about 2-1/2 inches
oil over medium-high heat to 375 degrees. Drop batter by the
tablespoonful into fat, making sure you do not crowd pan.  (This will
have to be done in batches.)  Fry hush puppies 4 minutes or until
golden brown and cooked through.  Drain briefly on paper towels and
serve immediately while they are very hot.  Makes about 40 hush
puppies.
