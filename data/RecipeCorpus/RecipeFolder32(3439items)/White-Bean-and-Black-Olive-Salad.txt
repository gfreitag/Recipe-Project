Title: White Bean and Black Olive Salad
Categories: Vegetables, Salads
Yield: 10 servings
1 lb Dry white beans, cooked
1 c  Sliced black olives, drained
1 c  Sliced scallions
1 c  Diced red/green bell peppers
1 c  Diced celery
1 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Dijon mustard
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
Salt & peper to taste
Soak and cook dry white beans.  I use Great Northern beans, but pea
beans or cannellini beans may be used.  Do not cook to mush, the
beans should be done, but also should have some "tooth".
Alternatively, you may use three 15-oz cans of cannellini beans,
drained and rinsed; they will weigh out to about 2 pounds when
cleaned.

Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and turn to mix well.  Adjust
seasoning to taste (dijon mustard, salt, pepper).

Makes 8 to 12 side servings.

I have combined this with chunk or solid white tuna for an entree
luncheon dish.  Serve with grilled swordfish, shark, or tuna for a
dinner dish. Makes 6 to 10 larger dinner servings.
