MMMMM-------------------GLUTEN FREE FLOUR MIX------------------------
Sift together SIX times
2 c  Wheat starch
3/4 c  Potato flour
3/4 c  Corn flour
1/4 c  Soy flour
1 c  Rice flour
6 tb Arrowroot flour
6 tb Tapioca flour
If you use this combination for baking, the time should be longer and
the over cooler than the original recipe calls for.  Blend together
thoroughly. Use this in any recipe calling for all purpose flour
EXCEPT for bread, gingerbread, doughnuts, fritters or shortbread,
unless you have a special gluten free recipe. Origin: The Allergy
