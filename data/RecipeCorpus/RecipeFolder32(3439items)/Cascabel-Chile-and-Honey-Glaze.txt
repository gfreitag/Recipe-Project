Title: Cascabel Chile and Honey Glaze
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 1/2 cups
4    Dried cascabel chiles or
2    Jalapeo peppers
1 c  Honey
1/2 c  Chicken stock
3 tb Tomato pure
1 ts Paprika
1 ts Ground cumin
Rehydrate the cascabel chiles by soaking them in warm water for about
2 hours before using them.

Drain the chiles and place them with the honey, chicken stock, tomato
pure, paprika, and cumin in a saucepan and simmer the mixture for
about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and pure the mixture in a
blender. Brush on grilled pork tenderloin or grilled chicken.

Note: if jalapeos are used, roast them and peel, seed, and dice them
before simmering them with the rest of the ingredients.
