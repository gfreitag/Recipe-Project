Egg Drop Soup is traditionally Chinese. Tomatoes are not. They were
introduced less than 100 years ago, but nevertheless, they work
wonderfully in this soup.

PUT THE CHICKEN STOCK into a pot and bring to a simmer. If using fresh
tomatoes, peel, seed and cut into 1-inch cubes. If using canned
tomatoes, chop them into small chunks. Lightly beat the eggs, then
combine them with sesame oil in a small bowl. Add the (Stirring the

scallion tops.
