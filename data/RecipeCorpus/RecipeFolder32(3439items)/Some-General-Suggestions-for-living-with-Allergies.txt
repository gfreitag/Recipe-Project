1.  Batters adjusted with substitutions may remain runny, so bake in
a pan with a rim to protect your oven; do not fill to the top.

2. Cakes which have been made with substitutes are very delicate.  For
easier removal, grease pan, line with waxed paper, grease and flour
the waxed paper with allowed substitutes for the grease and flour.

3. Always be on the lookout for recipes that do not use the allergenic
food, or that need so little of the allergenic food that substitution
is easy.

4. When cooking for allergic children, think of their food in terms of
substitutes for the ordinary food the rest of the family is having.
The closer in appearance an allergic child's food look to the family
food, the more satisfied and appreciative he will be.  This is even
more important when a child goes to a party.  Most hostesses are very
cooperative about their menu, so that you can match the food served
as nearly as possible with your child's special foods.

5. Be creative. If you can't use a traditional birthday cake, invent
one - either a mock one out of cardboard or say, a brick of ice
cream, frosted with whipping cream or drizzled with chocolate sauce,
topped by lighted candles.

6. Look into Chinese wok cookery or East Indian cooking as these do
not use traditional North American and European ingredients.
