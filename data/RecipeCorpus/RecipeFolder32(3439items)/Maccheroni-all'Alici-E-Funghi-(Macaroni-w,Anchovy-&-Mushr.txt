Maccheroni all'Alici e Funghi (Macaroni With Anchovy and Mushrooms)

(Roman)

1. Cook the parsley and the tomatoes in the quarter cup of olive oil
for 15 minutes.

2. Cook the pasta until barely done. Remove and dress with remaining
olive oil, tossing thoroughly.

3. Pre-heat the oven to 400-F. In an ovenproof dish that has been
oiled, place a layer of macaroni. Add a layer of mushrooms, the
garlic, the anchovy halves, olives, capers and a few dabs of the
sauce. Alternate layers until done. Dust the top with the bread
crumbs and sprinkle with a little more olive oil. Bake until the
bread crumbs lightly brown. Serve hot, or at room temperature.
