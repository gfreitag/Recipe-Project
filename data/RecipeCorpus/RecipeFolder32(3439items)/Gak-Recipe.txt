Title: Gak Recipe
Categories: Kids
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-----------------JEANNE LUPIEN   (DNDG63B)----------------------
MMMMM-------------------------SOLUTION A------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Warm water
1 c  Elmer's white glue
Food coloring
Mix together until
--completely dissolved
MMMMM-------------------------SOLUTION B------------------------------
4 ts Borax
1 1/3 c  Cups warm water
Mix together until
--completely dissolved
Pour solution A into Solution B. Do not mix!
Lift Gak out and knead into shape.

Here are some tips: Borax can be found in the laundry detergent
section
of a grocery store- such as "20 Mule Team"

If you are going to half the recipe... use only half of Solution A and
mix the whole amount of Solution B.  The results will be the same.
This is important..This is the only way you can half the recipe. Do
not double the recipe and do not reuse Solution B (the borax and
water), use only Elmer's glue.
