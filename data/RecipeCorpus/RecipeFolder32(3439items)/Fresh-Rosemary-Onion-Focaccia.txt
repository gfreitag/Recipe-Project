Title: Fresh Rosemary Onion Focaccia
Categories: Breadmaker, Breads
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/4 c  Water
1/3 c  Olive oil
1/3 c  Rosemary leaves
2 ts Salt
3 c  Flour
1/2 c  Cornmeal
1 tb Yeast
1 lg Spanish onions -- cooked
In:
2 tb Olive oil
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
2 tb Olive oil
Coarse salt
Ground pepper
Place all ingredients except cooked onion in the machine, program for
knead and first rise.  Press start.  Strain onions and return liquid.
At end of final knead, add the onion (without liquid) to the machine.
Restart and knead only until the onion is roughly mixed in.  The
dough will be wet and onion will remain in clumps, sticking out of
the dough. Turn the dough out on a well-floured board and knead
briefly by hand to form a ball. Oil a pizza pan or baking sheet.
Place the dough on the prepared pan and pat into a 12" disk.  Coat
the top of the dough with the onion juices. Cover with plastic wrap
and let it rise either at room tempature until doubled in bulk, or in
the refrigerator overnight.  A long cold rise in the refrigerator
will result in a more flavorful bread with a heartier interior.
Preheat the oven to 450 with the rack in the center position. Just
before baking the dough, use your fingertips to gently make
indentations in the surface.  Drizzle on the oil and then sprinkle
with salt and pepper.  Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce to oven to
350 and bake for another 12 to 15 minutes, or until the focaccia is
golden brown. Serve hot or at room temperature.
