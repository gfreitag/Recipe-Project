This is for one of those nights when you haven't been grocery
shopping and your tired and your hungry and you want something fast
and easy.

I've tried something nearly identical and we love it.

1. In large nonstick skillet heat oil. Add sliced onions and cook
over high heat until onions begin to brown, about 10 minutes. If they
begin to burn a little, that's o.k. too.

2. Lower the heat and add salt, sugar and spices. Cook 10 minutes,
stirring often, until onions are uniformly caramel-colored. Add water
and vinegar and cover. Simmer while the pasta is cooking.

3. Meanwhile, in a separate pot, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil.
Cook pasta al dente. Drain well.

4. Divide pasta equally into 4 heated bowls. Top with equal portions
of caramelized onions and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese, if
desired.
