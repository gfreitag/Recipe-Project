Title: MICROWAVE PEANUT BRITTLE
Categories: Microwave, Candies, Desserts, Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  White corn syrup
1 c  Peanuts, roasted and salted
1 ts Butter
1 ts Vanilla
1 ts Baking soda
In a 1 1/2 qt. microwaveable casserole dish, stir together sugar and
corn syrup.  Microwave on high for 4 minutes.  Meanwhile, lightly
grease a cookie sheet (can also use an unbuttered non-stick coated
cookie sheet). Stir in peanuts and microwave on high for another 4
minutes, until light brown. Add butter and vanilla to syrup, blending
well. Microwave on high 1 minute 45 seconds more. Peanuts will be
lightly browned and syrup VERY hot. Add baking soda and gently stir
until light and foamy. Pour mixture quickly onto prepared cookie
sheet.  Let cool 1 hour.  When cool, break into small pieces and
store in an airtight container.

Cleanup isn't as bad as it looks!  Once casserole dish has cooled,
fill with water and add all utensils used in preparation. Let soak a
short while and the candy will all dissolve away!
