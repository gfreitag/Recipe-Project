*  Cellophane noodles, also called bean threads, are translucent
threads made from the starch of green mung beans.  The noodles come
packaged in dry form.  Many supermarkets now carry them in the Asian
food section, and they also are available in Asian markets.  Other
thin noodles could be substituted, including curly Japanese ramen
noodles or vermicelli.

Prepare the Peanut Dressing.

Snap off the ends of the pea pods and remove the attached string, if
necessary.  Blanch the pea pods by dropping into boiling water for a
moment; then cool immediately with cold water.

Prepare the noodles according to the package directions.  Toss with a
little vegetable oil to prevent noodles from sticking together.  Set
aside.

TO PRESENT THE SALAD:  Line a bowl or platter with the lettuce.  Top
with the cooked noodles, pea pods, cucumbers, and carrot.  Drizzle
with the Peanut Dressing.  Garnish with the cilantro.

Makes 6 to 8 servings.
