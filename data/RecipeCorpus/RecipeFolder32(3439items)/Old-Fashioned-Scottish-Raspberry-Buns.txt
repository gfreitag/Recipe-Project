Title: Old-Fashioned Scottish Raspberry Buns
Categories: Scot/irish, Desserts, Breads
Yield: 1 batch
8 oz Flour; self-rising
3 oz Caster sugar
4 oz Butter
1    Egg; beaten
2/3 ts Milk
Raspberry jam
Caster sugar to dust
Set oven to 425øF or Mark 7.  Grease and flour baking sheets. Sift the
flour into a bowl and rub in the butter. Add the sugar and the beaten
egg with enough milk to make a fairly stiff consistency. Divide the
mixture into about walnut-size balls and place on baking sheets,
allowing space for them to spread slightly during cooking. Make a
small hole in the centre of each ball and spoon in a little raspberry
jam. Pinch the edges together again.  Dust lightly with caster sugar.
Bake for 10 minutes then reduce heat to 350øF or Mark 4 and bake for
a further 5 minutes. The buns should be light golden in colour. Cool
on a wire rack.
