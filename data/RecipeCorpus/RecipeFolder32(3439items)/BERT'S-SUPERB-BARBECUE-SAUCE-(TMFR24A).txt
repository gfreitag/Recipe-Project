Title: BERT'S SUPERB BARBECUE SAUCE (TMFR24A)
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Cider Vinegar
1/2 c  Water
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Prepared Mustard
1/4 c  Butter or Margarine
1    Thick lemon Slice
1    Onion; sliced
1/2 ts Pepper
1 1/2 tb Salt
1/4 ts Cayenne Pepper
3/4 c  Heinz catsup
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
In a saucepan, mix vinegar, water, sugar, mustard, butter, lemon,
onion, and seasonings. Simmer, uncovered, 20 minutes. Add
worcestershire sauce and catsup, bring back to a boil and its done.
(Good Housekeeping CB, 1955) NOTE: I do not use cayenne or salt and
always double this recipe. Into the double recipe, I add about 1/4 to
1/3 cup brown sugar. This gives the sauce more of a sweet and sour
taste. It is just excellent on Baby Back Ribs, which I simmer in
water with a little vinegar, garlic and just a pinch of salt for
about 30 minutes before barbequeing. Through trial and error, I have
found that Heinz catchup is thicker and makes a "clingier" sauce.
