Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1    Porterhouse steak; cut 2"

Procure a porterhouse steak of fine-grained texture, bright red in
color and well-marbled with fat.  Trim off the excess fat and wipe
with a clean cloth.  Heat a wire broiler, grease it with some of the
fat, and broil the steak over a hot charcoal fire for three minutes
on each side. Take a well-seasoned oak plank which has never been
washed but which has been kept scrupulously clean by being scraped
with a dull knife and wiped with good olive oil.  Lay the steak on
the plank, surround with a border of fluffy mashed potatoes, and put
in a hot (450 F) oven. After nine minutes, brush the potatoes over
with the melted butter and salt and pepper the steak. Return to the
oven for five minutes, remove, paint with butter, sprinkle with
parsley, garnish with the slices of lime, and serve at once.
