The principal flavor here is butter, cinnamon and lemon.

In a small bowl mix the soft butter with the garlic, cayenne,
cinnamon and divide the mixture in half. Rinse the pheasant and dry
thoroughly. Starting at the pointed end of the breast, use fingers
and a small knife to lift the skin away from the breast meat;
continue working your way under the skin to the legs, wings, and
thighs. Spread half the spice butter under the skin and then coat the
outside of the skin with the remaining butter mixture. Tie drumsticks
together, cover loosely and refrigerate for two hours. Preheat oven
to 350.

Arrange onions on the bottom of a shallow roasting pan and place
pheasant on its side in the center. Roast in oven for twenty five
minutes. Continue turning the bird from side to side, for fifty
minutes more until golden brown, baste with the melted butter and
lemon juice. When done, place bird on plate and spoon pan drippings
on top and serve.
