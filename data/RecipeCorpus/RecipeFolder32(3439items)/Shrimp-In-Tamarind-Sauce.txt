Title: Shrimp In Tamarind Sauce
Categories: Seafood, Indonesian
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Shrimp, fresh
1 ts Sesame oil
Salt; pinch
1 tb Sugar
2 tb Ginger, fresh; minced
2    Shallot; chopped
Coriander leaves; for garnis
2 ts Cornstarch
1/4 c  Tamarind liquid *
2 tb Fish sauce
1 tb Lemon juice
2    Thai chile; finely chopped
1 1/2 c  Oil
* To make tamarind liquid, pour 1/2 cup boiling water over five or six
fresh peeled tamarind pods, and let sit for 30 minutes.  Then pour
through a strainer into a bowl, pressing as much of the pulp through
as possible. Shell the shrimp.  Cut them in half lengthwise, toss
them in corn- starch and sesame oil and refrigerate for at least 30
minutes. Combine the tamarind liquid, salt, fish sauce, sugar, and
lemon juice and set aside. Combine ginger, chili peppers, and
shallots, and set aside. Heat the oil in a skillet or wok until hot
but not smoking. Add the shrimp and stir quickly to separate them.
Remove the shrimp when just pink and drain in a colander. Remove all
but two tablespoons of oil from the skillet, heat the remaining oil
over high heat and add the ginger/chile combination. Stir until
fragrant, then add the tamarind sauce.  When boiling hot, add the
shrimp and stir over high heat for a minute or so, until the sauce is
reduced. Serve garnished with coriander leaves.
