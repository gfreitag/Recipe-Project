Categories: Chocolate, Desserts, Rice
Yield: 6 servings
14 oz Can condensed milk
4 tb Unsalted butter
2    Egg yolks
2 c  Steamed boiled long-grained
-white rice
1 c  Whipping cream
1 oz Square + 2 oz chopped
-semi-sweet chocolate
1/2 c  Milk
1 tb Vanilla
1 ts Powdered sugar
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Butter a shallow souffle dish.

Combine the condensed milk with the chocolate in a mdm-sized saucepan
over low heat.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the chocolate has
melted, 5 minutes.  Gradually add the butter, and stir until melted.
Remove the pan from the heat.

Whisk the milk into the chocolate mixture.  Beat in the egg yolks and
2 tsp of the vanilla.  Then stir in the rice. Pour the mixture into
the prepared souffle dish, and bake 30 minutes.  The middle will be
slightly loose. Cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate, covered, until well
chilled.

Before serving, beat the cream in a lg bowl until slightly thickened.
Add the remaining 1 tsp vanilla and the powdered sugar, and beat
until stiff. Pile the whipped cream on top of the pudding. Using a
vegetable peeler, scrape the piece of semi-sweet chocolate over the
top to make chocolate curls.

Refrigerate until ready to serve.
