Categories: Seafood, Guestchefs
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Large shrimp
2 tb Olive oil
2    Garlic cloves -- minced
1/4 c  White wine
2 tb Minced parsley
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
A basic "shrimp scampi"-type recipe. Vary this recipe by adding fresh
herbs (rosemary, tarragon, oregano) or vegetables (snow peas, red
peppers, tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes). I suggest serving it over
linguine.

PEEL AND DEVEIN the shrimp. Heat the olive oil in a saute pan. Add the
garlic and saute 1 minute. Add the shrimp and saute just until they
turn pink. Add the wine and cook until it begins to simmer. Sprinkle
with parsley and stir in the salt and pepper.
