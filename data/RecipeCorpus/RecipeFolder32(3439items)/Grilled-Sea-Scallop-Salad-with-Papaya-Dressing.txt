The night before, prepare the papaya pure and marinate the scallops.
Peel and coarsely chop the papaya, place it in a blender, and reduce
it to a pure. Brush the scallops with 1 tbs of the pure (refrigerate
the remaining tablespoon for the dressing) and marinate them in the
refrigerator overnight.

When you are ready to prepare the salad, wash and dry the greens and
arrange them on salad plates. Prepare the dressing.

Combine the oil, lemon juice, remaining papaya pure, basil and tomato.
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Do not refrigerate the
dressing. Use it at once, at room temperature. Makes 1/3 cup.

Just before serving, brush the sea scallops with the olive oil, add
salt and pepper to taste, and grill the scallops over hot mesquite,
or charcoal, or saut them, for about 1 minute on each side. Do not
overcook them. Arrange the scallops around the greens, pour the
dressing over the greens, and serve immediately.
