Perfect for a crowd, this refreshing dessert can be made up to 2 days
ahead. "PAVE" refers to the dessert's flat square shape, imitating
tiles or paving stones. If you have time, it's fun to decorate each
square differently.

Grease 15 x 10 inch jelly roll pan; line with parchment paper.  Grease
paper and sprinkle lightly with flour. Set aside. In bowl, beat egg
yolks with sugar until light and fluffy; beat in lemon rind and juice
and vanilla.  In separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff but not
dry peaks form; fold into yolk mixture. Gently fold in flour until
thoroughly mixed. Spread in prepared pan; bake in 350 F oven for
15-20 minutes or until golden and cake springs back when lightly
touched. Let cool in pan.

LEMON RUM SAUCE:  In saucepan, combine sugar, water and lemon
juice;bring to boil. Boil for 1 minute; stir in rum. Brush over cake.

LEMON CREAM:  In saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over cold water; let
stand for 5 minutes to soften. Over low heat, warm gelatin gently
just until dissolved. Meanwhile, in bowl, beat egg yolks with sugar
until light;beat in lemon rind and juice. Beat in gelatin mixture.
Return to saucepan and cook over low heat for 5-6 minutes or until
barely thickened; let cool slightly.  In large bowl, beat cheese
until light;beat in lemon mixture. Let cool to room temperature just
until starting to thicken. Whip cream; fold into lemon mixture.
Spread evenly over cake. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 2
days. Cut into squares.

GARNISH:  Whip cream; beat in sugar and rum.  Spoon into pastry bag
and pipe decoratively onto each square. Garnish squares attractively
with strawberries, kiwifruit, mango, coconut and pistachio. Makes 20
servings.
