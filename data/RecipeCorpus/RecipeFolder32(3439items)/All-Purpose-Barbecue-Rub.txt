Article by Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby, coauthors of several
cookbooks, including Big Flavors of the Hot Sun (Morrow, 1994).

This rub, adapted from Big Flavors of the Hot Sun (Morrow, 1994), is a
little sweet, a little hot, with just a hint of clove. It can be used
on just about anything that you plan to barbecue, that is, to cook
over low, indirect heat for a long period of time. For large red-meat
roasts, such as leg of lamb or standing rib, increase the cayenne
pepper from one teaspoon to one tablespoon and substitute one
teaspoon cinnamon for the ground cloves.

Mix all ingredients in small bowl.
