Title: Grilled Salmon with Jalapeo-Honey Glaze
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Salmon fillets
Salt and pepper to taste
2 ts Jalapeo pepper, chopped
1/4 c  Honey
Cut the salmon into six 5oz portions. Season the fish with salt and
pepper to taste. Combine the chopped jalapeo and honey and set the
glaze aside. Spray a medium-hot grill with non-fat cooking spray and
grill the salmon for about 4 minutes per side or until it is firm in
the center. If a grill is unavailable, the fish may be sauted; it
will take the same amount of time to cook. During the last 2 minutes
of cooking, brush the uppermost side with the jalapeo-honey glaze. Do
not turn the fish over after that or the glaze will stick to the
grill.
