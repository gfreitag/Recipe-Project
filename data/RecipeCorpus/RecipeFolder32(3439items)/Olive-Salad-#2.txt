Mix all ingredients together well.  Store in refrigerator.

This is better after it has set several days to let the flavors mix.

NOTE: I got this recipe from my brother-in-law who got it from the
chef at Moran's in New Orleans.  It is very similar to the kind
served at the Central Grocery. When I made it, I used a little more
olive oil and garlic and added a little red wine vinegar because I
like the whang it gives the salad.  I also added the juice that was
packed in the jar of green olives.

The recipe as it was given to him did not have the carrots, celery,
cauliflower, peppers or onion listed but they are all present in the
jar that you buy from The Central Grocery.  I also added chopped
mushrooms because I like them and didn't figure they would screw
anything up. They didn't.
