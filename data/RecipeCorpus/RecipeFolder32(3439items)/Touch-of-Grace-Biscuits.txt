1 tb Sugar
1/8 ts Baking soda
3 tb Vegetable shortening
1 1/8 c  Buttermilk
1 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
Preheat oven to 475 degrees.  Spray an 8-inch round cake pan with
cooking spray.  In a medium bowl, mix self-rising flour, sugar and
baking soda until blended.  Cut in vegetable shortening with a pastry
blender or work in with fingertips until lumps are no larger than
small peas. Stir in buttermilk and let stand 2 to 3 minutes.  Dough
will be very wet and soupy. Pour all-purpose flour into a plate.
Flour hands well. Scoop up about 2 Tbsp dough into the flour.
Sprinkle more flour over the dough. Gently pick up the clump of dough
and shape it into a soft round by passing it from hand to hand,
shaking off excess flour. Place shape dough in middle of prepared pan
(dough will spread out). Shape 9 more biscuits the same way and place
around edge of pan.  Brush tops with melted butter and bake 18 to 25
minutes or until biscuits are evenly golden brown. Cool slightly in
pan before serving.  Makes 10 biscuits. Per biscuit: 204 calories, 5
