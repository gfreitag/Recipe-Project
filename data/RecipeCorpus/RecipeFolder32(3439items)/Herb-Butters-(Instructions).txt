One good technique for making fast summery sauces without the stove
is to prepare various compound butters with fresh herbs.  Probably
the best known is maitre d'hotel, which is seasoned with parsley,
salt, pepper, and lemon juice.  A dollop of this is often served on a
sizzling grilled steak. It is a superb combination.

These butters can be made with almost any blend of fresh herbs and
spices. Tarragon butter and sorrel butter go quite well with seafood.
Basil butter is excellent with poultry and vegetables while coriander
butter add an erotic touch to almost any grilled entree.  It can be
fun to experiment with your own. The following is a simple technique
for making herb butters that can be refrigerated and used when
needed. Blend a half pound of softened butter with the desired herbs
and spices in a small mixing bowl. Taste for seasoning and adjust if
necessary. Cool the mixed butter slightly until it becomes firm
enough to mold. Shape it into a rough cylinder and lay it in the
center of an 8- by 6-inch sheet of waxed paper. Roll the butter,
using both hands, and form into a cylinder about 5 inches long
wrapped in the waxed paper.  When the butter is rolled, fold over the
ends of the waxed paper to secure it; refrigerate. Open the package
when needed and slice off disks of the herb butter. Reseal and
refrigerate. Herb butter will last for weeks in the refrigerator if
securely sealed. [ Pierre Franey in The New York Times, Aug 13, 1986 ]
