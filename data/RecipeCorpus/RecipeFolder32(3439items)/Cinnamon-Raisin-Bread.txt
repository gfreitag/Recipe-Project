For those who love the sweetness of raisins in bread and the aroma of
raisins, this is a perfect loaf to try. If you program this bread for
breakfast, go ahead and add the raisins and walnuts on top of the
yeast, but expect the raisins to be mashed into the bread; even so it
is tasty!

Measure the ingredients except the raisins and nuts into the bread
pan in the order given. (Reverse the order in machines which call for
adding the liquids last of all.)

Program the machine for Sweet Bread, if your machine has the option,
or French Bread, so that it has a longer baking cycle and press
start. After 17 minutes, add the raisins and nuts, if used. Do not
stop the machine to do this; it should be in the middle of a kneading
process at this point. (See headnote if you wish to risk mashed
raisins.)
