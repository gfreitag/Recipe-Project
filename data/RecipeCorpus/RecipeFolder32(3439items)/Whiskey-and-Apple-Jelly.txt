Title: Whiskey and Apple Jelly
Categories: Scot/irish, Dips/spread
Yield: 1 batch
6 lb Cooking apples
Granulated sugar
Water
Good Scotch whiskey
Wash the apples, cut away any bad bits and quarter them. Place in a
large preserving pan and just cover with water. Boil until quite soft
but not pulpy.  Put into a jelly bag and allow to drip overnight. Do
not try to hurry the dripping process or the jelly will be cloudy.
Measure the juice and allow one pound of sugar to each pint of
liquid. Put the juice and sugar into the pan and stir over a moderate
heat until the sugar dissolves. Bring to the boil, stirring
continuously, skimming off the scum from time to time. To test if the
jelly will set drop a little on to a cold plate. When setting point
is reached, remove from the heat and allow to rest for a few minutes.
Add about a tablespoonful of whisky to the juice (quantity according
to taste).  Pour immediately into warm jars and seal. Do not use for
at least 3 months.
