Categories: Bbq/grill, Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
4 ea Salmon fillets - 6 oz each
4 tb Olive oil
4 tb Finely chopped shallots or
-red onion
1 ea Lemon, cut in half
Coarse salt
Coarsely crushed black

The woodsy flavour that cedar imparts to salmon is nothing short of
sensational.  To prepare 4 fillets, use one piece of well-soaked
cedar, about 8x12x3/4 inch thick.
1. Soak plank in water overnight.  Weight the plank to keep it
submerged. 2. Preheat grill to high. 3. Rub 4 salmon fillets all over
with olive oil. Top with shallots or onion and coarsely crushed black
(and pink, if using) peppercorns. 4. Top each fillet with a few
sprigs of fresh dill and squeeze lemon over all. 5. Place plank on
grill and sprinkle lightly with coarse salt.  Heat with cover down
for 2-3 minutes or until the top of the plank is nearly dry
(indicating that it's very hot) Caution: Keep a spray bottle nearby
to douse flames in the event the wood starts to burn. 6. Place salmon
fillets on top of cedar.  If you have two burners on your grill, turn
one off and place salmon on that side. Alternatively, if you only
have one burner, turn heat to lowest setting. 7. Cook salmon with
cover down for about 10 - 12 minutes, or just until cooked nearly all
the way through. 8. Squeeze a little fresh lemon over salmon, and
serve.
