1/2 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
Vegetable oil for cooking
Drain the can of salmon and place the salmon in a large mixing bowl.
Add the remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly.  The croquette
mixture should be moist and not too chunky. Grease one or two large
heavy skillets lightly with oil and heat over medium heat. (A
seasoned cast-iron skillet is perfect.)  Use about 1/4 cup of the
croquette mixture to form patties 3 inches across and about 1/2 inch
thick. Cook the croquettes, turning them once, until golden brown on
both sides, about 4 minutes. Serve hot. Serves 6 Note: You may have
to cook the croquettes in batches. Keep the cooked ones hot on a
baking sheet in a preheated 250 degree oven while cooking the rest.
