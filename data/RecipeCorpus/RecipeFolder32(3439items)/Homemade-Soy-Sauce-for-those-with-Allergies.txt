Categories: Allergy, Salsa/sauce, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
Soy sauce contains gluten
-and wheat.  Ingredients
-include protein
Extracts from corn and soy
-beans, wheat, parts of
-corn and cane, water
And salt.
If anyone wants to experiment with a homemade soy sauce the
ingredients are salt, hot water, molasses or caramel. The flavor
changes with the heat of the water; experiment until you find the
right combination of ingredients. It won't be real soy sauce but it
makes a good substitute. This should be used in our recipes calling
for soy sauce that are marked wheat and gluten free. VARIATION: Soy
sauce substitute can be made by taking 2 beef bouillon cubes and
dissolving them in boiling water - 1/8th cup or less.  The more
concentrated the tastier it is.  Use on chow mein or other Chinese
style dishes.  GOOD!! Origin: The Allergy Cookbook. Shared by: Sharon
