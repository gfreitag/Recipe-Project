Title: Prickly Pear Ice
Categories: Native amer, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Water
1 1/2 ts Freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/2 c  Sugar
2 3/4 c  Prickly pear juice
2    Cactus pads (nopales),
-scraped, trimmed and cut
-into Indian motif shapes,
-for garnish
In a stainless steel or glass saucepan, bring the water and lemon
juice to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to low, add
the sugar, and stir constantly until dissolved.  Remove from the heat
and stir in the prickly pear juice.   Let cool.

Pour the liquid into a glass or stainless steel baking pan (do not use
aluminum because the acid in the prickly pear juice will react with
it) and place it in the freezer.  Stir the liquid every 20 minutes
until it has frozen into grainy, magenta-colored ice crystals.  The
process should take about 1 1/2 hours, depending on the temperature
of your freezer.

Serve with cactus pad garnish. ******************
