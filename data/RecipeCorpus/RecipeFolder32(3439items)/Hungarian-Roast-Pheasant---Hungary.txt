Clean and pluck pheasants. Do not pluck or remove the heads but
protect them in oiled paper. Reserve the tails to decorate the
platter. Rub the birds inside and out with salt and pepper, sprinkle
with a little bit of Tokay.

Inside each pheasant put the bay leaves, garlic, cloves, parsley,
celery leaves and chopped lemon. Cover each breast with the fat pork
moistened with a little Tokay. Sew the openings, truss the birds and
lay them side by side in a medium sized roasting pan. Add onion
slices, mushroom peelings and moisten with one cup of Tokay and
chicken stock. Season with salt and ten peppercorns.

Roast in a moderate 350 oven for forty five minutes basting every ten
minutes. Carve the pheasants, slice the breasts and reshape the birds
in their natural form on a heated serving platter. Remove the paper
from the heads and arrange the feathers neatly with the tails.

Strain the pan gravy through a sieve into a saucepan and let it stand
for a minute until the fat floats on top, skim off the fat, bring to
a boil and stir in the jelly. Taste for seasoning and pour into a
sauce boat.
