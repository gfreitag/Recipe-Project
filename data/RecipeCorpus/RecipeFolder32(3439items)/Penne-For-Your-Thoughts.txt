PENNE FOR YOUR THOUGHTS

This is one of my favorite lowfat pasta recipes--it even contains the
all-nutritious spinach!  (Really makes me feel healthy when I eat it).

Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat.

Add onion and cook until softened, about 6 minutes. Stir in garlic
and red pepper flakes; cook 30 seconds.  Add greens and cook over
high heat, stirring, until most of the liquid is evaporated, about 5
to 6 minutes. Remove from heat.  Stir in ricotta, salt, pepper, and
peel. Toss with hot pasta and parmesan.

The way the recipe was written, it supposedly makes 4 servings, but I
think if that is true, they are 4 rather large servings!  I like to
make this size batch because I can reheat it for quick meals for
several days. If you do reheat it in the microwave, I suggest putting
a tiny bit of water in the bottom of the bowl, sprinkling a little
fresh parmesan on top, and covering the bowl (loosely).  If you
don't, the microwave really dries it out and it just doesn't taste as
good as when it is freshly made. The only real fatty ingredients are
the olive oil and the parmesan (and I've been wondering whether they
will find a way to make lowfat parmesan--I haven't seen any in the
stores).  I do wish that I had a calorie/fat amount for the recipe; I
got the recipe from a magazine and that information either wasn't
there or I didn't copy it down. (Oops!)

Hope you all enjoy this recipe as much as I do!
