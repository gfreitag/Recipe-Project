1.  Place the chicken legs on a wooden board and, using a sharp
knife, stab them in several places.  This helps them absorb the
marinade and prevents the skin from breaking. 2. Make the marinade by
heating the vegetable oil and adding the garlic, green onions, and
lemon grass. Cool for between 2-3 minutes then leave to cool. Stir in
the chili, Nuocmam, sugar, and salt. 3. Put the chicken legs in a
shallow dish and pour the marinade over. Cover the dish and marinate
for 2 hours, turning from time to time. 4. Brush liberally with
sesame oil and put on a barbecue or under a preheated moderate
broiler for 15-20 minutes, turning frequently and brushing with oil.
5. Serve immediately with lemon dip and pickled vegetables. Guests
make their own dip by mixing salt and pepper, and moistening with a
quarter of lemon.
