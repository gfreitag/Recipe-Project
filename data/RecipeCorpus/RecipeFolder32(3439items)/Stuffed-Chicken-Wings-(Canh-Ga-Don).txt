Categories: Poultry, Vietnamese
Yield: 4 servings
8    Chicken wings
MMMMM--------------------------STUFFING-------------------------------
4 oz Bean thread vermicelli
3    Pieces dark wood ear fungus
1 1/4 c  Ground pork

1.  Bone the chicken wings by cutting around the bone with a sharp
knife. Holding the wingtip, gently ease the bone away to leave the
skin and a thin layer of chicken. 2. Soak the vermicelli in warm
water for 10 minutes then drain thoroughly and cut into short
strands. Soak the wood ear fungus in warm water for 10 minutes then
squeeze dry and chop into thin slices. 3. Mix all the stuffing
ingredients together.  The mixture should be firm. Mold the stuffing
into a ball and insert it into the bag of flesh and skin of the
chicken wings. 4. Preheat the oven to 400 Â°. Steam the stuffed wings
for 10-15 minutes.
(If you want to make a large quantity, multiply the measures
accordingly and freeze after the steaming stage.) 5. After steaming,
place in a lightly oiled roasting pan and roast in the oven for 30
minutes. Serve on a bed of lettuce as a starter or with rice and a
beef stir-fried dish.
