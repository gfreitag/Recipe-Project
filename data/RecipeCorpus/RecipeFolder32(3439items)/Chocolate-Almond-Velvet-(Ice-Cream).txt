1    16 oz can chocolate syrup
1    16 oz can sweetened
Condensed milk
4 c  Whipping cream
2 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Blanched almonds
Before starting, make sure you have a very large plastic container
with a tight fitting lid and enough rom in your frezer to store it.
Measure 6 cups of water into the container and see if there is enough
space left to use an electric beater without it sp remove the mixture
from the freezer. Stir in the vanilla, and beat the ice cream at high
speed with a hand mixer until it is the consistency of softened ice
cream. This takes a fair bit of time, fold in the almonds, store the
ice cream in the freezer. It
