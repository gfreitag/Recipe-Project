Pizza Primavera

From Cooking Light Magazine Sept. Oct. 1991

Cook broccoli and carrot in boiling water 2 minutes.  Add snow peas
and zucchini; cook 1 minute. Drain and rinse under cold running
water; set aside.

Combine cornstarch and milk in a large saucepan; stir well.  Bring to
a boil, and cook 2 minutes or until thickened, stirring constantly.
Remove from heat; stir in 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and next 4
ingredients. Add broccoli mixture, onions and basil, tossing gently;
set aside.

Sprinkle provolone cheese over prepared crust, leaving a 1/2-inch
border. Spoon vegetable mixture on top of cheese.  Sprinkle with
remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  Bake at 500 deg.F for 12 minutes
on bottom rack of oven.

Remove pizza to a cutting board; let stand 5 minutes.  Yield: 6
servings (about 269 calories per wedge).
