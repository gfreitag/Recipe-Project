Title: Spicy Fish Chowder (New England)
Categories: Soup/stew, Seafood
Yield: 8 servings
2 lb Cod or haddock fillets
1/2 ts Black pepper
Cayenne pepper
24 ea To 36 hard-shelled clams
4 c  Boiling fish stock
1/4 lb Salt pork; diced
2 lg Onions; chopped
3 ea Potatoes; diced
1 c  Milk
1 c  Heavy cream
1/8 ts Mace
1/8 ts Cloves
1 ds Tabasco sauce
1 ds Worcestershire sauce
2 ea Fresh tomatoes; peeled,
-seeded, and chopped
1/4 lb Butter
Common crackers or oyster
-crackers
Cut the fish into 1-1/2 inch pieces, sprinkle with the peppers and
thyme (salt will come from the clams and salt pork), and put aside.
Scrub the clams well under cold water to rid them of sand and put
them in a pot with a little water on the bottom.  Cover pan tightly
and steam the clams until the shells open, about 15 minutes.  Remove
the clams from their shells, saving the broth for the stock.  Slip
the black skin from the foot.  If the clams are large, chop the meat
of the foot, and leave the soft part in one piece.  If clams are
small, use whole. Strain clam broth through cheesecloth into the
stock. Add water, if needed, to make 6 cups.
Fry salt pork until crisp in a ceramic-lined or non-metallic
kettle and add onions to soften gently without browning.  Add
potatoes and then cover with the fish stock.  Simmer about 5 minutes.
Add milk and cream, the seasonings, and the chopped tomatoes. (If you
have chopped the clam meat, add it now.) Simmer another 5 minutes and
taste for seasonings.
Remove pan from heat.  Add fish and clams (whole or the soft
bellies) and refrigerate overnight.  Reheat in a 200 F to 225 F oven
just below the simmering point. Put a tablespoon of butter in each
soup bowl, add soup, and crumble crackers on top or serve them
separately.
