Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM----------------VULCAN WEDDING CAKE (CARROT---------------------
6 oz Ground almonds
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Cloves
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
6 oz Grated carrots
1 tb Vulcan bitter nectar*
1 tb Grated lemon rind
1 tb Lemon juice
5 tb Margarine
6 oz Sugar; a bit more than 3/4 c
5    Eggs
*Dark Jamaican rum may be used. To be made as a wedding cake, many
rituals would have to be performed during the making of the cake.
This is a nonritual version. Sift the ground almonds and flour
together to make a very fine mixture. Add the salt, spices and baking
powder and mix well. In a separate bowl put the grated carrots and
the nectar. Add the lemon rind and juice. Cover and let stand. Cream
the margarine and sugar together. Separate the eggs, putting the
yolks in with the margarine and sugar and saving the whites for
later. Beat the egg yolks in and then add the carrot mixture. Stir
well and let sit for a few minutes. Beat the egg whites until soft
peaks form, then set aside. Add the dry ingredients to the carrot
mixture and mix well. You should have a thick batter. Now beat the
egg whites a little more and fold the batter into the egg whites. Mix
gently until it is just barely evenly mixed. Pour into a greased ring
mold. Bake at 325 degrees for about 50 minutes. It is done when a
skewer comes out clean. Take out of the oven and let cool for 5
minutes. Unmold onto a serving plate dusted with confections sugar
(this prevents the cake from sticking as much).
