Put bulgur in a heatproof bowl. Bring water to a boil and pour over
bulgur. Let bulgur stand 1 hour.

While bulgur is soaking, in a large bowl, stir together onion, salt,
allspice, and dried mint, if using (do not add fresh mint now), and
let stand 30 minutes. Drain bulgur in a sieve, pressing hard to
extract as much water as possible, and add to onion mixture with
remaining ingredients, including fresh mint, if using.

Toss salad well and season with salt and pepper.
