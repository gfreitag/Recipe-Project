"When I first tested this recipe, I accidentally left out the butter
and it still worked amazingly well.  So, for a lower-fat variation,
simply omit the butter."

Butter and flour 12 muffin cups.

Grate rind from orange; reserve.  Remove and discard white pith from
orange and cut peeled orange into quarters, removing seeds.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  In a blender, combine rind, orange
quarters, orange juice, butter, egg, raisins and rum; blend 5
seconds. Transfer mixture to a large nonreactive bowl.

In another bowl, sift together dry ingredients.  Add dry ingredients
to orange mixture and stir just until blended (do not over stir).

Spoon mixture into prepared muffin cups, filling each cup two-thirds
full, and bake until muffins are golden, 15 to 20 minutes.  Makes 12
muffins.
