tablespoon cold water over part of the mixture; gently toss with a
fork. Push to side of bowl. Repeat, using 2 to 3 more tablespoons
cold water, until all is moistened. Form dough into a ball. On a
lightly floured surface, using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll
pastry into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Transfer to a
10-inch tart pan; ease pastry into pan. Trim pastry even with rim of
pan. Do not prick pastry. Line pastry shell with a double thickness
of heavy-duty foil. Bake pastry in a 450F oven for 5 minutes. Remove
foil. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes more or until pastry is nearly done.
Remove from oven. Reduce oven temperature to 325F. Sprinkle tart
shell with Parmesan cheese.
Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl beat egg whites slightly. Stir in
ricotta cheese, garlic and 1 tablespoon thyme; spread over pastry.
Overlap large tomato slices in a circle around edges. Arrange yellow
cherry tomatoes in a circle within tomato ring. Fill center with red
cherry tomatoes. Stir together olive oil and 2 teaspoons thyme. Brush
tomatoes with oil mixtures.
Bake tart in a 325F oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until heated
through and nearly set. Serve warm or at room temperature. Store
leftovers in the refrigerator. Makes 10 to 12 appetizer servings.
