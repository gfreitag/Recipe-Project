Title: Orange Mint Iced Tea
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 recipe
8 c  Water
Orange juice (for ice
-cubes
8    Tea bags
12    Or more fresh mint
-leaves, divided
Sugar (to taste)
-(optional)
1    Orange, cut in slices
-and the slices in half
1    Lemon, cut in slices and
-the slices in half
Pour the orange juice into an ice-cube tray and freeze to make ice
cubes.

TO PREPARE THE TEA:  Heat the 8 cups water to a boil.  Pour over tea
bags and 6 mint leaves. (If sweetened tea is preferred, add a little
sugar at this point and stir to dissolve.)

Let the tea steep for about 10 minutes, then remove tea bags.  Cool
tea completely and remove mint.  Refrigerate until it will be used.

TO MAKE SUN TEA:  In a clear jar or pitcher, combine the tea and
water and let stand in the sun for several hours.  Or, if you have
more time, combine the tea bags with cold water and refrigerate for
at least a day.

TO SERVE THE TEA:  Pour it into a pitcher and add orange-juice ice
cubes, 6 mint leaves and fruit slices. Or serve individually in tall
glasses, each serving with a mint leaf, orange-juice cubes and slice
of both lemon and orange.

Makes about 6 to 8 servings.

NOTE:  If the tea becomes cloudy when it is refrigerated, add a small
amount of boiling water to it to clear it up.  Cloudiness can occur
if the tea is not completely cool when refrigerated.
