Title: Barbecued Lamb Ribs
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Onion; finely chopped
1    Clove Garlic; minced
1 tb Olive Oil
1/4 ts Dry Oregano
1/4 ts Ground Cinnamon
1/8 ts Cayenne Pepper
1 1/2 ts Firmly Packed Brown Sugar
1 tb Balsamic Vinegar
1/4 c  Catsup
2 tb Dry Red Wine
2 1/2 lb Lamb Spareribs; fat trimmed
In a 1 to 1 1/2 quart pan over medium heat, cook onion and garlic in
oil, stirring often, until soft but not brown, 6-8 minutes. Mix in
oregano, cinnamon, cayenne, brown sugar, vinegar, catsup, and wine.
Stirring, bring to a boil on high heat and cook 1 minute. Let cool
slightly; if made ahead, cover and refrigerate up to 2 days.

Brush lamb ribs all over with sauce. Place on a grill 4-6" above a
solid bed of medium-hot coals. Cook, turning once and basting with
any remaining sauce, until ribs are browned on all sides, 15-17
minutes total for medium-rare. Watch carefully since meat is fatty;
turn or move on grill to stop flare-ups. Cut ribs apart and pick up
to eat (supply plenty of napkins.)
