2 lb Fresh jumbo shrimp
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1/4 c  Catsup
3 ds Hot pepper sauce
1    Garlic clove; crushed
1/2 c  Oil
1/2 lb Bacon; (or more)
Lemon wedges
Shell and devein uncooked shrimp. In a bowl, mix next 5 ingredients.
Marinate shrimp in mixture 30 mins. to 1 hour at room temp. Cut bacon
into thirds or halves and wrap bacon around shrimp. Thread onto
skewers. Grill until bacon is crisp, 10 to 12 mins. Turn several
times and brush with reserved marinade. Bacon dripping will cause the
grill to flare up, so keep the water spritzer handy. Serve at once
with lemon wedges. Formatted by Judy Garnett    Source: Simply
