Wash and dry pheasant and rub inside and out with salt. Put the liver
in a piece of butter and place inside the pheasant, fasten the bacon
across the breast. Bake in a preheated 350 oven, basting often with
butter. After pheasant has cooked for thirty minutes, baste with
cream and water, a spoonful at a time. Pheasant should cook about one
and a half hours. Remove bacon before serving. Stir flour into
drippings, brown and add water as needed. Cook for five minutes and
serve gravy on or with pheasant.
