Roast the pheasant for about an hour and a half at 350. Combine the
sugar and vinegar in a sauce pan; heat until sugar melts, add the
orange juice and reduce over high heat to one fourth the original
quantity. Add the Gran Marnier and brown sauce, bring to a boil. Cook
shredded orange peel in water to cover and salt until peel is tender,
strain and add to the gravy. Remove the pheasant to a hot platter and
pour the sauce over it and serve.
