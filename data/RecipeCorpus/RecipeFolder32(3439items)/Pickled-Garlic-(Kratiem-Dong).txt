Here's something that might appeal those of you engaged in the Garlic
Thread.  It's not for everyone, but if you're a true garlic fan, these
munchies might be right up your alley.  Thai garlic comes in pods
that are about the same size as Western garlic but the cloves are
about The plus is that they don't have to be skinned before use.  The
emphasis here is on the sour rather than the sweet.  Quite a taste
sensation.

1 cup white vinegar
4 cups water
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon salt
6 garlic pods (approximately 120 cloves depending on size), peeled

In a medium saucepan, bring the vinegar, water, sugar and salt to a
boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Drop in the garlic.
Return to boil for 1 minute, then remove from heat.  Cool, and fill
sterilized, screw-top jars.  Store in the refrigerator for at least 1
week before eating. Continue to refrigerate, tightly covered, between
serving.
