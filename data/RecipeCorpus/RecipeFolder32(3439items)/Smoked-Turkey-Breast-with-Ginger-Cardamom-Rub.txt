Spice (Harvard Common Press, 1994), a guide to cooking with smoke.

1. Rub turkey breast all over with the spice rub, then sprinkle with
salt. Cover and refrigerate rubbed turkey breast for 2 to 3 hours.
(Can be covered and refrigerated overnight.)

2. Following instructions for grill or smoker setup (see "How To
Smoke-Cook with a Kettle-Style Grill" or "How To Smoke-Cook with a
Water Smoker," page 19), soak wood chunks and set up grill or smoker.

3. Smoke turkey breast until meat thermometer registers 165, about 6
to 7 hours. Remove from grill or smoker and let rest at least 15
minutes. Carve and serve. (Can be cooled to room temperature, wrapped
in plastic, and refrigerated up to 3 days.)
