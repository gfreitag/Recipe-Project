Title: Roasted Garlic Dip~
Categories: Dips/spread, Healthy
Yield: 1 servings
1 lg Head garlic
1 c  Part-skim ricotta cheese
1/4 ts Black pepper
Preheat the oven to 375F. Wrap the garlic in aluminum foil, set on the
middle oven rack, and roast for one hour. Remove the garlic from the
oven and cool until easy to handle.

Separate the garlic into cloves. Working over the container of an
electric blender or food processor, pinch each garlic clove so that
the roasted flesh slips out. Add the ricotta cheese and pepper to the
blender and puree by whirling for 10 to 15 seconds. Transfer to a
small bowl and serve. Makes about 1 1/4 cups.
