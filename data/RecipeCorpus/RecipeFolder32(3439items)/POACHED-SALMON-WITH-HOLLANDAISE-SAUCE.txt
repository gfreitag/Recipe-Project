Prepare the Hollandaise Sauce.  Heat the water, salt, peppercorns,
lemon slices, parsley, onion, and bay leaf to boiling, in a 12-inch
skillet then reduce the heat.  Cover and simmer 5 minutes.  Place the
salmon steaks in the skillet, adding water if necessary to cover the
steaks. Heat to boiling and then reduce the heat.  Simmer uncovered
12 to 15 minutes or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.  Serve
with the Hollandaise Sauce.

HOLLANDAISE SAUCE:

Stir the egg yolks and lemon juice vigorously in a 1 1/2-quart
saucepan. Add 1/4 cup of the butter and stir over very low heat,
stirring constantly, until the butter is melted.  Add the remaining
butter. Continue stirring vigorously until the butter is melted and
the sauce is thickened. (Be sure the butter melts slowly as this
gives the eggs time to cook and thicken the sauce without curdling.)
Serve hot or at room temperature. Cover and refrigerate any remaining
sauce. To serve again, stir in a small amount of hot water.
