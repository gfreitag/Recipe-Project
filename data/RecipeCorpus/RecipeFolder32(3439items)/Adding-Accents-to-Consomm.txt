Title: Adding Accents to Consomm

Choose a final seasoning and garnish to make it even more intriguing
and attrractive. Almost any ingredient is possible as an accent to
consomm, as long as you like the way the flavors, textures, and
colors work with the pale, clear liquid.

Cook garnishes ahead so their flavors stay distinct from the flavor
of the consomm. And some things, like pasta or beans, would absorb
too much consomm during cooking. Use only non-fat methods to cook
your garnishes (boiling, steaming) because any fat used in cooking
will ruin the clarity of the consomm. Two exceptions to the cook
ahead rule are peeled, seeded, and diced tomatoes or sliced fresh
truffles; both are soft enough to go straight into the liquid. Here
are some other ideas:

~ Infuse the consomm by steeping with fresh herbs or spices: rosemary,
tarragon, lemongrasss, saffron.

~ Flavor the broth before clarification with ground spices (adding
them to the finished consomm would make it cloudy): Indian garam
masala, Chinese five-spice.

~ Vegetables cut in neat julienne, tiny dice, or parisienne (pea-sized
balls made with a tiny melon baller), small asparagus tips, fresh
peas, tiny mushrooms.

~ Dried beans and legume: black beans, black-eyed peas, navy beans,
adzuki beans, lentils,

~ Pastas, stuffed or unstuffed: totellini, ravioli, wontons, bow-ties,
orzo.

~ Grain like pearl barley or wild rice.

~ Delicate slices of meat, chicken or fish, either the same typw as
the consomm or a different type for contrast.

~ Small shellfish: shrimp, clams, scallops, mussels, lobster claws.

~ Last minute accents: blanched strips of citrus zest, edible
flowers, or a few drops of flavored oil.
