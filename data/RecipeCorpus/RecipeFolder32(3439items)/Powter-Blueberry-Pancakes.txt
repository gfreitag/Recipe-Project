Title: Powter Blueberry Pancakes
Categories: Breakfast, Fruit, Pcake/waffl
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/4 c  All purpose flour
3/4 ts Salt
3 tb Sugar
2 ts Double acting baking powder
1 lg Whole egg; lightly beaten
1 1/2 ts Veg oil; preferably canola
1 1/4 c  1% milk
1 c  Frozen blueberries
Measure and sift together the first 4 ingredients.  If you don't have
a sifter, gently shake the ingredients thru a fine mesh strainer.

Combine the next 3 ingredients in a seperate bowl.

Place the frozen blueberries in a third bowl.  Coat the blubs with 1T
of the dry ingredients.  Do not let them thaw.  This will prevent the
blueberries from turning the entire batter blue.

Combine the wet and dry ingredients into one bowl.  Mix together
using a fork.  Do not overmix the batter because it will make the
pancakes tough. There should be small lumps visible in the batter.

Add the blueberries to the mix and stir in just enough to incorporate.

Preheat a large nonstick frying pan or griddle over med heat.

Drop 1/4c of batter per pancake onto the skillet.  When the top of the
pancake is covered with little air bubbles, turn it over.  When the
second side is golden, remove from pan and serve.

Options:  Replace blueberries with 1 banana, thinly sliced; 1 apple,
cored and chopped into small pieces with 1t cinnamon (the apple needs
to be sauteed a little in water to soften); strawberries; raspberries.

14% cals from fat.

My note:  These are thin, but are already my kids favorite.  Husband's
favorite too.  A nice flavor!
