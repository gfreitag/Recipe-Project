FOR CRUST:  Sift flour and salt into large mixing bowl.  Using pastry
blender, cut in half the shortening until mixture resembles coarse
meal. Add remaining shortening and continue to blend until mixture
resembles tiny peas.  Sprinkle ice water over dough, 1 tablespoon at
a time, mixing with fork until soft ball forms.  Shape into ball,
cover with waxed paper or foil and chill several hours or overnight.
Dough can also be prepared in food processor using standard method.
Lightly flour board and roll out half of dough.  Press into a 9 inch
pie pan and trim, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Reserve remaining half
of pastry. FOR FILLING: Place rack in lower third of oven and preheat
to 400 F. Combine strawberries and rhubarb in large mixing bowl.  Mix
together sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg; sprinkle over
fruit, tossing gently to blend. Add egg (optional) and toss again.
Spoon mixture into bottom crust. Roll out remaining pastry on lightly
floured board and cut into 1/2 inch strips using pastry wheel if
possible to make a more decorative lattice. Lay half the pastry
strips horizontally 1 inch apart over the filled pie. Weave the first
vertical strip through center of pie, gently folding back
corresponding portion of horizontal strips as you work over and
under; DO NOT PRESS DOWN FIRMLY. Repeat, working outward from center
to both sides, placing cross strips about 1 inch apart, until lattice
is completed.  Trim any overhanging strips to rim of pie pan. Fold
overhang of lower crust over strips and press firmly around edges to
seal. Brush with egg and water to glaze.  Bake until crust is golden,
or 40 to 45 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature with garnish
of sweetened whipped cream or creme fraiche. FOR LEAF DECORATIONS:
(Instead of lattice) Roll remaining half of pastry 1/8 to 1/4 inch
thick. Use leaf canape cutter to make about 2 dozen leaves. "Etch"
veins with dull side of knife. Use remaining pastry as needed to form
flower shape. Brush egg-water glaze on outer rim of pie shell. Place
leaves around rim, pressing lightly but firmly. Transfer flower to
center of filling. Brush pastry with additional glaze and bake as
directed.

Makes 6 to 8 servings.
