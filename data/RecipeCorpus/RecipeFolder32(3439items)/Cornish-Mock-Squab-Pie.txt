Title: Cornish Mock Squab Pie
Categories: British isl, Pie/tart, Fruit, Meats
Yield: 1 pie
4    Or more apples; peeled,
-quartered, cored
-and sliced
1 lg Onion; sliced
2 ts Pumpkin Pie spice*
1/2 lb Lamb or mutton; diced
1 c  Sugar
1/2    Recipe- pie crust for lid
These are Great Aunt Ellen's word for word instructions:

"Cut up some apples to 1/2 fill the dish; then cut up a nice large
onion; add 2 tsp. of spice (not the sweet but what you put in pork
pudding) Add 1/2 or 3/4 pound mutton cut up just like we should for
pasty, a good cup of sugar, then more apples to fill the dish."

My [Mabel's] note: The spices were about the same as I put in pumpkin
pie. I used pie crust topping but tea biscuit dough is alright.

*Jim's Notes: Pumpkin pie spice mix: Combine 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp
ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.
