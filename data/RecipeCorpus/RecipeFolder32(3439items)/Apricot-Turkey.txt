4    To 6 lb. turkey breast
-- cut in 1" cubes
1 tb Vegetable oil

Combine brown rice vinegar, molasses, and grated onion.  Add turkey
cubes; toss to coat turkey with marinade.  Refrigerate for several
hours or overnight.  Drain turkey, reserving marinade.

Add oil to heavy nonstick skillet, set on medium heat, and brown a few
turkey cubes and the garlic at a time (if you crowd the pan, the meat
will steam, not brown).

Put browned turkey in a large casserole.  Combine reserved marinade,
white grape juice, water, lemon juice, and grated ginger; pour over
turkey. Stir in apricot slivers and cover.

Bake at 325 F. for 30 minutes.  Turkey should be tender.  Stir in
cilantro.

Serve over steamed rice.
