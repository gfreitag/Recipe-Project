Title: Hot Chocolate 2
Categories: Chocolate, Beverages
Yield: 2 servings
1 pt Milk
3 oz Imported chocolate (milk
Chocolate or semi-sweet)
Pour 1/4 cup of the milk into a small, thick-bottomed pot.  Break the
chocolate into small bits and add to the milk in the pot.  Over very
low heat, let the chocolate melt, then pour in the rest of the milk,
bit by bit, whisking well with each addition.  When the chocolate is
melted and the milk faintly steaming, remove from the heat, beat
vigorously with a whisk until frothy, and serve.

Variations: A small amount of chocolate-based liqueur, such as
Cheri-Suisse, Vandermint, or Droste Bittersweet is liked by some.  Of
course, unsweetened baking chocolate can be used instead.  Use the
same proportion: 1 1/2 oz. chocolate per cup of milk and sweeten to
