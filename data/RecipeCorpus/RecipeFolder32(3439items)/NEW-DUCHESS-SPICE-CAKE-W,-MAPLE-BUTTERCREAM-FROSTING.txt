MAPLE BUTTERCREAM FROSTING:

1/2    cup    Crisco shortening (regular only)
1/2    cup    butter, softened
tsp.   maple flavoring (like vanilla extract)
cups   (1 lb.) powdered sugar
Tbsp.  milk

2

Cream butter and shortening.  Add maple flavoring. Gradually add
powdered sugar.  Gradually add milk and continue beating until light
and airy.  Add more milk if needed.  Color with paste colors.

This icing is a light yellow and colors you add will be affected by
this. For pure white icing, use 1 cup regular Crisco shortening and
1/2 tsp. Wilton butter flavoring. This icing is somewhat stiffer.
For blazing white, add Wilton White White. Wilton White White will
also make the first buttercream recipe whiter, but be careful with
colors as they will still tend to be yellowish.

Note:  Excellent cake and frosting!
