Blanch the carrots, leeks and celery together by dropping them into
boiling water and removing them when the water returns to a boil.
Place each salmon fillet in the center of a piece of parchment paper
and spread 1 tbs of the olive pure over each piece of fish. Top the
pure with some of the blanched vegetables, diced tomato, ginger,
basil, and lime juice. Fold the two sides of the paper over the fish
and its topping. Pick up the two ends and fold them over together,
making a neat seam. Bake the parcels for about 15 minutes.

Just before serving, make a small slit in the parchment and serve the
fish hot, with cilantro beurre blanc.

Cilantro Beurre Blanc:

Put the wine, vinegar, and shallots in a skillet and reduce the
mixture over moderate heat until the liquid is completely gone and
only the shallots remain. Whisk in the cream and softened butter, 1
cube at a time. Serve the sauce hot, but do not allow it to boil.
