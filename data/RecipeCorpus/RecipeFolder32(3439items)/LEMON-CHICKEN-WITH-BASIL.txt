Title: LEMON CHICKEN WITH BASIL
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2    Chicken breasts
1 lb Mushrooms
1    Lemon, sliced into thin wedg
1 c  Tomato sauce-8 oz
1    Basil; chopped fresh
6    Sprouts
Chives; chopped
1/4 c  White wine-cheap
1/2 c  Mozarella cheese, shredded *
1 c  Rice, uncooked
Parmesan cheese.
Chicken breasts can be split to 4 pieces or cubed to bite size. In
deep fry pan, saute chicken and mushrooms in half of the white wine
with basil, lemon, and chives until mostly done. Splash in rest of
wine (or extra) as needed.  Add tomato sauce, cover, and simmer for
20 minutes, or until thickened, stirring occasionally. When done,
lemon wedges should be thoroughly cooked, and can be eaten.  Serve
over steamed rice. Top with a sprinkle of parmesan or mozarella (not
too much) and a little sprinkle of chives. (It's good without the
cheese, too.) Garnish with a fresh sprig of basil and wedges from
unused half of lemon. Serves 2 (plenty). NOTE: The white wine can be
replaced with apple juice. As a matter of fact, I like mushrooms
cooked in apple juice until it's reduced down to almost nothing. A
lot less calories than cooking them in butter, and tastes great.
Sometimes I'll put in a clove of garlic. (I haven't tried this when
using apple juice instead of wine yet.) D PILEGGI (TDJR42A) Recipe:
