1. Mix coriander, chili pods, cumin, mustard seeds [use black mustard
seeds if you can find them], fenugreek seeds, and peppercorns in the
container of an elctric blender or spice mill and grind the spices to
a fine poweder in several batches,  Pour into a bowl and combine
well. 2. If you are using fresh curry leaves, dry them briefly (about
4 to 5 minutes) in an ungreased frying pan over low heat.  Grind them
in the blender and then add them to the spice powder in the bowl. 3.
Stir in the turmeric. 4. Transfer the curry powder to an airtight
jar, cover tightly, and store in a cool place for up to three months.
NOTE: For mild-tasting curry powder, reduce or eliminate chili pods.
[My note: this amount of chili pods will make a very hot curry!
Reduce them according to your own taste for hot food. Don't worry
about the curry leaves
