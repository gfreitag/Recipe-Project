Prepare a small batch of your favorite savory [non-sweet] pie crust or
pastry and roll out until it is 1/8" thick. Cut out shapes and line
"barquettes" [they look like little scows or flat bottomed boats] if
you have them or clean sardine cans or small tart/muffin trays. Bake
for about 10 minutes at 425 or until lightly browned. Cool.

In the meantime make an aspic glaze of gelatin and fish stock,
flavored with lemon juice by soaking the gelatin in 1/3 cup of stock,
dissolving it over hot water and adding the rest of the stock. Chill
until it starts to thicken and set aside.

Assemble the boats by lining the cool pasties with mayonnaise, and
then making a pattern with the dill or onions and the caviar. Coat
with aspic glaze and refrigerate several hours for the aspic to
finish setting.

[These boats are ideal for a number of other canape fillings as well.]
