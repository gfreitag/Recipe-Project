Title: Chipotle-Ancho Chili Pesto
Categories: Main dish, Pasta, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 recipe
2 ea Dried ancho chilies
-=OR=- pasilla chilies
1 lg Red bell pepper
2 ea Canned chipotle chilies
-- (in adobo sauce)
-- rinsed & seeded
1/3 c  Pine nuts
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
2 ea Garlic cloves
1/4 c  Olive oil (or more)
If you prefer a milder sauce, use only one chipotle chili in this
recipe; if you like your food super spicy, use two.

Makes about 1-1/3 cups

Remove stems and seeds from ancho chilies.  Place chilies in large
bowl. Cover with boiling water.  Let stand until soft, about 30
minutes. Drain, reserving 1 tablespoon soaking liquid.

Roast bell pepper over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all
sides.  Seal in paper bag and let stand 15 minutes.  Peel, stem and
seed pepper.

In processor, blend ancho chilies, 1 tablespoon soaking liquid, bell
pepper, chipotles, pine nuts, fresh lemon juice and garlic until
almost smooth.  With machine running, gradually add 1/4 cup olive
oil; process until smooth.  If pesto is dry, mix in more oil by
spoonfuls. Season with salt.  (Can be made ahead.  Press plastic wrap
onto surface of pesto. Cover and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze
up to 1 week. Bring to room temperature before using.)
