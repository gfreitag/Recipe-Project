Categories: Vegetables, Chinese, Game, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
1    Pheasant-cut into bite size
Pieces
1/4 c  Ground pork
1    Egg
4 tb Chinese black beans
2    Scallions-sliced
4    Cloves garlic-crushed
6 sl Fresh ginger
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Creme sherry
2 tb Soy sauce
1/2 ts Sugar
2 tb Oil
1 tb Cornstarch
Remove the pheasant breast and cut into bite size pieces. Cut the
remaining edible portions of the bird across the bone in the typical
Chinese fashion, into bite size pieces. Crush the black beans and
garlic in a mortar and pestle adding the equal amounts of oil,
sherry, soy sauce and the fresh ginger. While the beans are setting,
take the scallions and cut into two inch pieces. Dissolve the
cornstarch in two tablespoons of water, and in a separate bowl beat
the egg. Now you're ready to continue. Saute the pheasant pieces in a
large skillet until almost done. Add the pork and continue cooking
for three more minutes. Combine the black beans, sugar and mix well.
Add a half cup of water and bring to a boil, cover and cook for five
minutes. Stir in the cornstarch to thicken if necessary. Add the
scallions and mix well. Pour in the beaten egg gently and turn off
the heat.
