Categories: Breakfast, Cake/cookie
Yield: 12 servings
1 c  Soy milk

1/3 c  Soft tofu
2 1/4 c  Flour; or w.w. pastry flour
1 1/4 c  Brown sugar; packed
3 ts Cinnamon
1 1/2 ts Ginger

Preheat the oven to 350.  Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.

Place the soy milk, vinegar, and tofu in a blender and blend until
completely smooth.

In a large bowl, mix the flour, brown sugar, 2 1/2t of cinnamon,
ginger, salt, and oil.  Work the mixture with a pastry knife, a fork,
or your fingers until well blended.  Transfer 1 1/4c of this mixture
to a small bowl and mix in the remaining 1/2t cinnamon and the
walnuts. Set aside.

To the remaining flour mixture, add the baking powder and baking soda,
along with the blended tofu.  Mix until smooth.  Spread the batter
evenly in the baking dish and sprinkle the reserved flour-nut mixture
over the top.

Bake for 30-35 mins, or until a cake tester inserted in the center
comes out clean.
