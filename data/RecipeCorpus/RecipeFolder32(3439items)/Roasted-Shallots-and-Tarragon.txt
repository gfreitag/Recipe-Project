Title: Roasted Shallots and Tarragon
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
16 lg Shallots
1 tb Butter, cut in small pieces
1/2 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Madeira or red wine
1 1/2 ts Tarragon, chopped or
1/2 ts Dried tarragon
1/4 ts Salt
1 pn Black pepper
Preheat oven to 425F.

Peel the shallots and cut part of the root end off, leaving enough of
the root so that the layers of the shallot will hold together.
Immerse the shallots in boiling water for 2 minutes and drain them
thoroughly. Place them in a small shallow baking dish and dot them
with the butter. Roast, uncovered, for 10 minutes.

Mix the cream with the Madeira, tarragon, salt, and pepper and pour
the mixture over the shallots. Return the shallots to the oven and
continue to roast them for another 30-35 minutes, uncovered. Toward
the watch, watch the dish carefully. If the cream sauce separates,
whisk in a little water and additional cream.
