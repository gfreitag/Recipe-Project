If you're leery of making jam because you don't want to go to the
trouble of canning, consider this easy to make freezer jam. Cook the
fruit with sugar and spice, spoon it into freezer containers and put
it away. A few months down the road and you'll be glad you did!

Combine apricots, nectarines, sugar and lemon juice in a medium
saucepan over medium high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.
Continue cooking until jam thickens, about 30 to 35 minutes.

Remove from heat and stir in ground cinnamon. pour jam into plastic
freezer containers and place a cinnamon stick in the center of each.
Let stand until cool. Cover jam and store in freezer.
