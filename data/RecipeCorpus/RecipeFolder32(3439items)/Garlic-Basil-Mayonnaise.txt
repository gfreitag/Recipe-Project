Title: Garlic Basil Mayonnaise
Categories: Herbs/spice, Dips/spread, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 batch
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
1    Egg
4    To 7 garlic cloves; to taste
1/2 c  Spicy Globe or lemon basil
-- tightly packed
1/4 ts Dry mustard or
1 ts Dijon-style mustard
1 tb Lemon juice or cider vinegar
1 ds Sugar
Salt and pepper; to taste
2/3 c  Olive oil
Put all ingredients except the olive oil in a blender or food
processor fitted with a steel blade.  Puree for 1 minute, then slowly
add the olive oil with the machine still running.  Stop as soon as
all the olive oil has been added and the oil has emulsified.  Do not
overblend. A tablespoon of hot water blended into the finished
mayonnaise will stabilize it.

"The Herb Companion" writes: "Try this spread with meats, grilled
chicken, and vegetables, on sandwiches, and in salads."
