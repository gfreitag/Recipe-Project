Title: PETA No Pork Sausage
Categories: Breakfast, Vegetables, Sausage
Yield: 6 servings
10 oz Frozen lima beans; thawed
3/4 c  Vegetable broth
1/4 ts Sage
1/4 ts Rosemary
6 tb Cornmeal
1 tb Veg oil; to 2T
In a blender or food processor, coarsely chop the lima beans with the
vegetable stock.  The lima beans should remain chunky.

In a medium saucepan, heat the lima bean mixture, sage and rosemary
until boiling.  Slowly beat in 4T of the cornmeal and cook until
thickened and bubbly.  Cool to room temp.

Sprinkle the rest of the cornmeal onto a pie plate.  Pat the lima bean
mixture into 1/4 inch patties and coat each patty with some of the
cornmeal on the pie plate.  In a large skillet, heat 1T of oil and
fry the patties until lightly crisped and browned on both sides,
about 5 mins. Add more oil if necessary.
