Pouding Renverse des Bleuets

Lemon-flavoured cake batter baked over fresh blueberries makes a
perfect dessert. When I was immersed in French language studies at
Jonqiere's Centre linguistique, Jeannine Renouf treated me to this
recipe and also to a version that she makes with wild raspberries. It
was a delectable kind of immersion.

Combine blueberries, 1/4 cup of the sugar and lemon rind in a
buttered 8 inch square baking pan.
In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. In another bowl,
cream shortening with remaining 1/2 cup sugar until fluffy. Beat in
egg and vanilla. Add dry ingredients alternately with milk, blending
well after each addition and finishing with dry ingredients.
Pour batter over fruit in pan and bake in a preheated 350F oven for
about 40 minutes, or until a tester inserted in centre comes out
clean. Let cool slightly; turn out onto serving plate. Cut in squares
and serve warm or at room temperature, with whipped or ice cream, if
desired. SERVES: 6-8
