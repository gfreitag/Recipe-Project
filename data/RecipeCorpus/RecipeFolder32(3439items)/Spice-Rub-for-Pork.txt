Article by Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby, coauthors of several
cookbooks, including Big Flavors of the Hot Sun (Morrow, 1994).

For large roasts like a fresh ham or pork shoulder, you may want to
add cayenne pepper or hot red red pepper flakes to the mix.

1. Toast fennel, cumin, and coriander over medium heat in small
skillet, shaking pan occasionally to prevent burning, until first
wisps of smoke appear, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, cool to room
temperature, then mix with remaining ingredients.

2. Grind to powder in spice grinder or with mortar and pestle.
