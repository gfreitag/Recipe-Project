From the deep south of Louisiana comes a pheasant version of the
famous Jambalaya, prepared in the creole fashion.

In a large skillet heat oil and add vegetables, cook slowly stirring
often until tender. Add all of the meats and cook for five minutes.
Combine the balance of the ingredients. Turn into a large casserole
dish. Cover and cook for one hour in a preheated 350 oven.
