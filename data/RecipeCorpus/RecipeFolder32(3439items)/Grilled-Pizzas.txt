Categories: Pizza
Yield: 1 servings

Preheat a grill or outdoor barbecue.

Divide the pizza dough in half and roll each half into a 6-inch
circle. Brush the pizzas with olive oil, then place them, oiled side
down, on a hot grill.  Cook the pizzas until the dough firms up and
the first side is scored with grill marks; watch the pizzas carefully
so that they don't burn.  Brush the other side with olive oil then
turn the pizzas.

Brush pesto on one of the pizzas and top with Bel Paese cheese or
Muenster or fontina and sun-dried tomatoes.  Spread tomato sauce on
the other pizza, then add mozzarella and black olives.  Remove the
pizzas from the grill and place them on serving plates.  Brush the
edges with olive oil; dust with Romano cheese and serve.
