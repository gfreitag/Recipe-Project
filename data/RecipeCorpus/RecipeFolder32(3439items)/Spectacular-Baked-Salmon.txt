-follow)
Preheat oven to 375F

Fish should be butterflied - head and tail removed, but centre bone
removed - and stuffed. Make a wrapper for fish by folding edges of 2
large pieces of foil together. Place stuffed salmon on foil so that
back is up and stuffed portion is down.

Combine wine, lemon juice and seasonings, brush over fish.

Wrap foil loosely around fish, leaving room inside for steam to
circulate. Bake 1 hour and 20 minutes.  To check for doneness, open
foil at top and insert small knife.  If it flakes, it is ready.  If
not cover and return to oven for 5 - 10 minutes more.  Do not over
cook.
