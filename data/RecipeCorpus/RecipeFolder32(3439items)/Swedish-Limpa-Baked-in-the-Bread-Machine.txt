This spicy Swedish rye bread is a perfect one to bake in the bread
machine. Set the timer so that it will be hot when your dinner is
ready.

Measure all of the ingredients in the order given in to the bread pan.

Select either basic bread or wheat bread setting and medium crust.
Program the machine, if desired, for delayed baking (follow
directions that come with the machine). Press start.
