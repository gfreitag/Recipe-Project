Title: Karhi Poori
Categories: Breads, Indian
Yield: 50 servings
1 c  Flour, whole wheat pastry
1 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
1 tb Pepper, black; coarse
3 1/2 tb Butter, sweet; softened
Oil; for frying
Sift the flours and salt into a bowl; add the pepper and cut in the
butter until the mixture resembles coarse oatmeal. Now slowly add
very hot water--about a half cup plus three tablespoons--and begin to
gather the flour together. Squeeze the dough into a ball. It should
just about hold together. Do *not* knead. Break the dough into about
fifty balls. Keep them covered with a lightly dampened tea towel.
Heat about 1-1/2 to 2 inches of oil in a wok over a medium flame.
While the oil is heating, begin to roll out the pooris. Take each
dough ball, flatten it, and roll it into a very rough round, about
two inches in diameter. (Don't worry if the edges are ragged or
cracked). Roll and fry as many pooris as the wok will conveniently
hold in one layer. Fry two to three minutes a side, until the pooris
are a very light sandy color on both sides, and crisp. Crank the heat
up or down as needed. Remove the pooris and drain on paper towels or
newspaper (or both). Allow them to cool and store in an airtight
container. They won't need refrigeration, and should stay fresh for
several weeks.
