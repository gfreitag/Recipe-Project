From "Count Out Cholesterol Cookbook" By Mary Ward.

If you have a taste for chicken wings, try these.  They are hot,
spicy and delicious.  To reduce the fat and cholesterol even further,
use lean chicken breast strips in place of the wings.

Serves 6 (3 wing pieces)

no stick cooking spray

Cut off wing tips and discard (T: or stash in the freezer for stockpot
later).  Separate the wings at the joints.  Cut off any visible fat.
Wash and pat dry.  Or simply use the chicken strips.

In a med saucepan, combine the teriyaki sauce, plum sauce, sugar,
Worcestershire sauce, garlic, ginger, arrowroot, and water.  Heat,
whisking the sauce, until smooth and thick and the sugar and
arrowroot are dissolved.  Put the chicken pieces in the hot marinade,
cover, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 400F.  Spray a lg baking pan with no stick cooking
spray. Drain marinade from wings.  Bake for 15 min until they are
tender and crispy.  (Or, bake chicken strips for 10 min.)  Serve hot.
