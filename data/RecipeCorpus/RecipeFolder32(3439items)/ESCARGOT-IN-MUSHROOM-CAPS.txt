*  To Blanch Escargot: Blanching is the first step  in  preparing
escargot dishes.Fill a 3 quart pan half full of water (enough  to
cover the snails).When water boils,drop in the rinsed snails.Boil
vigorously for 3 minutes (no more or the snails will get
tough).Remove snails and rinse in cold water.Remove nails from shells
with a toothpick.Place snails in bowl containing a mixture of half
water and half vinegar for two hours.Snails are now ready to simmer
in sauces.They may be cut into two or three pieces,if
desired.Blanched snails,may be frozen.Note: Do not save snail
shells,which are fragile.
