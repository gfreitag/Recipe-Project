"Bread Machines" article by Beatrice Ojakangas; author of Great
Holiday Baking Book and the forthcoming Light Muffins (Clarkson N.
Potter).

Honey whole wheat bread is a favorite of ours. I tried the bread with
a higher percentage of whole wheat flour and did not have consistent
results among all of the machines. Graham flour has some of the wheat
bran in it, as opposed to plain whole wheat flour.

Measure the ingredients into the container of the bread machine in the
order given. (Reverse the order in machines which call for adding the
liquids last of all.)

Program the machine for Wheat bread if your machine offers that
choice, otherwise select Basic Bread, medium crust and press start.
