in the cavity and truss. Fasten neck and skin to back with a skewer.
With a brush, coat skin evenly with two tbs of softened butter. Drape
the bacon slices in a shallow roasting pan with the breast up, cook
in a preheated oven at 350 for twenty minutes. Increase oven heat to
400. Remove pheasant and discard bacon slices, brush with melted
butter, roast twenty minutes basting often.

Transfer to a heated platter and let the bird rest for ten minutes.

used as a stuffing. Traditionally this dish is served with bread
sauce and game chips. This dish may be decorated with its own tail
feathers before serving.
