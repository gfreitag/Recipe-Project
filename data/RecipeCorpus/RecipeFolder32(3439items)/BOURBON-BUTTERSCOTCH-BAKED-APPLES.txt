6 lg Baking apples; cored
1/2 c  Unsalted butter;cut in small
-pieces
3/4 c  Brown sugar; firmly packed
3/4 c  Bourbon
3/4 c  Light cream
1 tb Vanella
1 tb Lemon juice
Preheat oven to 350 deg. Remove a strip of peel from around the top
of each apple with a vegetable peeler. Set the apples upright in a
flameproof baking pan just large enough to accomodate them. Top the
apples with the butter; sprinkle with brown sugar, then drizzle with
the bourbon over all. Bake until the apples are puffed and tender,
basting them occasionally with the pan juices, 30 to 35 min. Transfer
the apples to a platter and keep warm.  Stir the cream into the
baking pan and set over high heat. Bring to a boil, then lower the
heat to medium high and cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce is
reduced by half and coats a spoon, 7 - 10 min. Remove the sauce from
the heat and stir in the vanilla and lemon juice. Spoon the sauce
onto dessert plates and set an apple in the center of each one and
serve immediately. Per serving: 302 cal, 10 gr fat, 26 mil. chol, 7
