Title: SPICY KEBABS
Categories: Meats, Bbq/grill, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
2 lb Pork or lamb
-(boneless), lean, cut
-into 1 1/2 inch cubes
1/4 c  Peanut butter, smooth
1 ts Coriander, ground
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper (or more,
-to taste)
1 ts Cumin, ground
1/2 ts Pepper
4    Onions
1    Garlic clove, minced
1 1/2 ts Lemon juice
1 tb Brown sugar
1 tb Soy sauce
Grate the onions.  This is best done using a food processor.  Mincing
is not good enough; you want to end up with something wet and mushy.
Don't stick your nose into the food processor.

Put all the ingredients into a large bowl, mix well, and cover.
Refrigerate for several hours, mixing occasionally.

Put meat cubes on skewers, keeping as much of the onion mixture on
them as you can. Grill over hot coals, turning to brown each side,
for 20 to 25 minutes or until meat is cooked through. (Lamb should
still be slightly pink; pork should not.)

NOTES:

*  Spicy pork or lamb kebabs -- I copied this from a newspaper or
magazine a long time ago; I forget where. It was originally for pork,
but it's good with lamb, too.

*  You could probably put some vegetables (onions, bell peppers) on
the skewers between the meat chunks; watch out that the veggies don't
burn.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, several hours marinating, 30 minutes
cooking.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
