Title: Roasted Duck (Kathy Pitts)
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
Here's the duck roasting
Method that was given to me
Many years
Ago by an elderly gentleman
Who had worked as "duck
Chef" for a major
Restaurant in Los Angeles.
The results are as you
Describe -- a fairly
Fat-free duck with a dark
Brown, crispy skin.
Rinse the duck inside and out. Trim off the first joint of the wing,
and pull off all visible fat from both the neck cavity and body
cavity of the bird.  Rub the inside of the duck with a cut lemon.  If
you like, stick a couple of pieces of celery and a cut orange inside
the body cavity of the duck (it gives a nice flavor).

Truss the duck for roasting.  Now comes the fun part:  with an
icepick or carving fork, stab the H**l out of the duck, particularly
on the lower portion of the breast, and along the thighs.  Rub the
duck skin with a cut lemon.

Place the duck on a rack in a fairly deep roasting pan (you'll need
it to catch the fat).  Preheat your oven to 450 degrees.  Place the
duck in the oven, and roast for exactly 15 minutes.  Pull the duck
out, and stab it again.  Reduce the oven heat to 350, and return the
duck to the oven. Roast until the duck reaches an internal
temperature of 180 degrees, continuing to prick the skin of the duck
maybe every 20 minutes. DO NOT BASTE. As the fat from the duck
accumulates in the bottom of the pan, drain it out, to prevent it
from coming over the top of the roasting rack and touching the duck.
This entire process will take about an hour and a half. From: Pat
