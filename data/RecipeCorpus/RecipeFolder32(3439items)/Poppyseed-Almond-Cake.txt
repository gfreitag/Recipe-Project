Title: Poppyseed-Almond Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 8 servings
1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1/3 c  Canola oil
2 lg Eggs -- at room temperature
2 tb Poppyseeds
3/4 ts Almond extract
1 1/2 c  Cake flour
3/4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Milk
1/3 c  Sliced almonds
Confectioner's sugar
Preheat oven to 350~. Place rack in middle of oven. Butter and flour
an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2-inch loaf pan.

In a large bowl, whisk together granulated sugar, canola oil, eggs,
poppyseeds and almond extract until blended. In a medium bowl, sift
together flour, baking powder and salt. Dividing the flour mixture
into 3 batches, whisk the flour into the egg mixture alternately with
the milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Pour the
batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the almonds evenly over the
top. Bake until top is deep brown and a toothpick inserted into
center comes out clean, about 1 1/4 hours. Transfer to a rack and let
cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Invert onto the rack, turn right-side
up and let cool completely. Using a fine-mesh sieve, sift
confectioner's sugar evenly over the top just before serving. Makes 1
loaf cake.
