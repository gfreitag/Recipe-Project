Title: Baked Flatbread with Garlic (Lahsooni Naan)
Categories: Breads, Indian, Vegetarian, Ethnic
Yield: 12 servings
4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Cream of tartar
1/4 ts Sea salt
1/2 c  Water
1 tb Egg replacer
1 c  Soymilk or lowfat milk
2 tb Canola oil
1/4 c  Olive oil or melted ghee
2    Garlic cloves; minced
Combine flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt.  Set aside.

Whisk water and egg replacer.

Mix egg replacer, soy milk and canola oil in a large bowl.

Add flour mixture to soymilk mixture and stir until dough forms a
ball. Knead briefly, place in a greased bowl and cover with a damp
towel. Let dough rest in a warm, draft-free area for 2-1/2 to 3 hours.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Lightly oil baking sheets.

Saute garlic in olive oil for 2 minutes.  Set aside.

Lightly coat hands with vegetable oil and knead dough on a lightly
floured surface until smooth, about 3 minutes.  Divide dough into 12
equal pieces and roll each into a ball. Flatten each ball with hands,
roll into an oval about 3/8" thick and stretch ends to form a
teardrop shape (wide at base and tapering to a point on top).

Place on baking sheets and brush with garlic oil.  Bake on middle
rack for 6 to 8 minutes.
