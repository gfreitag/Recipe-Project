Categories: Candies, Chocolate, Desserts, Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
1 lb Butter
1 lb Creamy peanut butter
12 oz Chocolate chips
2 lb Powdered sugar
1/3    Stick parafin wax
Whole walnuts
Melt together butter and peanut butter in a large pan.  Once melted,
remove from heat and add powdered sugar; mix well.  It will look like
cookie dough. Roll into balls the size of large walnuts.

In a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips along with approximately
1/3 to 1/2 stick of parafin.

Dip balls with a toothpick into chocolate mixture and put on wax
paper. Remove the toothpick and cover the whole with a whole walnut
piece.
