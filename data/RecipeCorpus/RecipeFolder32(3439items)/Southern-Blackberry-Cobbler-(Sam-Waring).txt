This is one of the few

Makes, and it is indeed
-very good.
4 c  Fresh blackberries
3/4 c  + 2 Tbsp sugar
3 tb + 1 3/4 c flour
1 1/2 c  Water
1 tb Lemon juice
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Shortening
6 tb Whipping cream
6 tb Buttermilk or sour milk
2 tb Butter, melted
Cream & sugar (optional)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place berries in a lightly greased
2-quart baking dish. Combine 3/4 c sugar and 3 Tbsp flour; add water
and lemon juice, mixing well.  Pour syrup over berries; bake about 15
minutes while preparing the pastry. Make pastry by combining 1 3/4 c
flour, 2 Tbsp sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in shortening until
mixture resembles coarse crumbs; stir in whipping cream and
buttermilk. Knead dough 4 or 5 times; roll to about 1/4" thickness on
a lightly floured surface. Cut dough to fit baking dish. Raise oven
temperature to 425. Place pastry over hot berries; brush with melted
butter.  Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown.
