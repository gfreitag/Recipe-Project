Title: Cajun Grit Cake
Categories: Cajun/creol, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
3/4 c  Hominy grits
3 c  Boiling water
1 ts Salt
2 tb Cajun spice
3/4 c  Cooking oil
3/4 c  Flour
1 c  Chopped onions
3 tb Minced garlic
1 1/2 c  Chopped bell pepper
3 c  Peeled chopped tomatoes
2 tb Cajun spice
Optional chicken stock/water
In a large saucepan slowly add the grits to the boiling water and
season with salt and Cajun spice (I make my own, with at least a
dozen different spices, but for the occasional user it is just as
easy to find a blend at the market).  Cook the grits till done and
pour into a greased 9 X 13 pan. Refrigerate severl hours or overnight
till firm; this will be cut into 8 squares when ready to fry.

Next, make a roux with the oil and flour (consult any Cajun cookbook
as to how);  the roux may be light to dark brown, your preference. To
the hot roux, add the onions and garlic and sautee till golden. Add
the green peppers and tomatoes, bring to a boil, reduce heat and
simmer. Add Cajun spice to taste, and add water or stock if necessary
to keep from becoming too thick.  Final product should be the
consistency of chunky spaghetti sauce, dark and spicy.

Cut grits into 8 pieces, fry in some oil till golden, drain, and top
with the sauce.

Serve with plenty of yeasty bread and beer.
