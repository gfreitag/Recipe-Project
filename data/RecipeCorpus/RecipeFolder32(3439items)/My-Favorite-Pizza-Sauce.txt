Title: My Favorite Pizza Sauce
Categories: Pizza, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb Olive oil
1    Onion, chopped
2    Garlic cloves, finely
-chopped
1 cn (28 oz.) Tomatoes, crushed
-or whole
1 cn (8 oz.) Tomato sauce
1 tb Basil
1 tb Oregano
1 tb Salt
1/4 ts Crushed red pepper
Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in 3-quart saucepan.  Add onions and
saute until transparent and golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Add
garlic and saute 2 to 3 minutes longer.  Add tomatoes and the rest of
the ingredients. Bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer for at least
40 minutes.  If using crushed tomatoes (concentrated or with puree),
water will have to be added to prevent the sauce from becoming too
thick.  Normally about 1/2 of the tomato can of water will be enough.
Add more or less as you prefer.

Makes enough sauce to cover 6 medium pizzas.
