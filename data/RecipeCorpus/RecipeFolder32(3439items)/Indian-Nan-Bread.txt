Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Yeast
1 tb Sugar
4 oz Warm milk
1 lb Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1 tb Plain yogurt

Stir the yeast and sugar into the milk and leave covered in a warm
place for 10-15 minutes. Stir the flour, salt and baking powder
together, leaving a well in the centre. Add the yogurt and butter and
mix. Gradually add in the yeast mixture, adding more milk if

Then, divide the dough into approx. 20 balls, and roll each out on a
floured surface. Brush each with melted butter. Place on baking
sheets and bake at 375 degrees for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until
brown specks appear.
