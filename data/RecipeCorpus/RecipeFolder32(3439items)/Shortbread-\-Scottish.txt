Yield: 1 batch
2 c  All purpose flour
1    Heaping tbs. cornstarch

y have a heavy-duty electric mixer, cut in the butter with the
machine. not, do it by hand with a pastry blender.  Knead the dough
by hand for just a moment and form it into a circle 3/4 inch thick on
a nonstick baking sheet, and flute the edges. Prick the whole circle
with a fork. Bake in a preheated 325 F. oven for 1/2 hour, or until
it just begins turn a light golden brown. Allow it to cool for a few
minutes, and the remove it to a rack for the final cooling. When
cool, the cookie can b cut, but the Scots simply bread it up into
pieces and serve it with tea

Note. If you wish to form smaller cookies from this recipe, just
remember to watch the baking time. Smaller cookies will cook more
quickly. Recipe from the Fugal Gourmet.
