PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Beat the butter until light and soft, then beat
in the sugar. Continue beating until very light. Stir in the almonds,
then the flour. Scrape dough onto a piece of plastic wrap, flatten
and wrap. Chill until firm, about 1 hour. Flour dough and surface
very lightly and roll dough 1/4-inch thick. Cut into 3-to-4-inch
rounds with a fluted cutter. Transfer to paper-lined pans and cut a
1-inch opening in half the rounds with a plain cutter. Paint the cut
rounds with beaten egg and strew with the sliced almonds. Bake the
bases about 15 minutes, keeping them very pale. Cool the bases.
