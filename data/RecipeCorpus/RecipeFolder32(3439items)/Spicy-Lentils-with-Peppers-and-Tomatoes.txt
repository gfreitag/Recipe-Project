Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed skillet or casserole and add
the onion and garlic.  Saute over medium-low heat until the onion is
tender and beginning to color.  Add the green pepper and chili
peppers and saute another 5-10 minutes until the pepper is tender and
add the tomatoes and drained lentils.  Add a little bit of cooking
liquid from the lentils if the mixture seems dry.  Simmer over
medium-low heat for 15 minutes. Season to taste with more salt and
pepper, stir in the cilantro and lemon juice if desired, and serve,
or allow to cool and serve chilled.

This dish will keep for 3-5 days in the refrigerator.  Serves 6-8.
