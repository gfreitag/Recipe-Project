Unless it is prepared with the greatest of care, this dish will be
very dry. It is not generally recommended, but care should be
observed in selecting a young, plump pheasant. It should be cut up
like any foul, cooked in butter on a moderate fire and keep somewhat
underdone. Cook it in the same manner as "Chicken Saute" and cover
it. Wash the sauce pan and prepare a sauce after the recipe in common
use. This sauce must be rich and should be poured over the pheasant
just before serving.
