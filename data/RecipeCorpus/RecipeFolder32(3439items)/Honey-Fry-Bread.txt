Title: Honey Fry Bread
Categories: Ethnic
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Whole-wheat flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Honey
2 c  Vegetable oil -- for frying
Mix the flours, salt, sugar and baking powder together. Add about 1/2
cup water and mix well, adding a bit more water if needed to make a
stiff dough. Turn out on lightly floured surface and knead until
dough becomes elastic and smooth. Let rest for 10 minutes. Roll out
1/2 inch thick. Cut into squares, strips, or circles. Deep fry in
very hot oil until golden brown. Drain on brown paper bags or paper
towels. Drizzle honey in a very thin stream over bread and serve
immediately. Sprinkle with a little cinnamon if desired. This is not
the traditional fry bread since it has honey in it, but is a favorite
also.
