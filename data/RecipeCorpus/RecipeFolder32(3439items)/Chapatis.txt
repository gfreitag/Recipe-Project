Title: Chapatis
Categories: Indian, Breads
Yield: 10 servings
1 1/2 c  Flour, unbleached
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  ;water
1/2 c  Flour, whole wheat
3 tb Ghi
Mix flours, salt, and butter and add just enough water to make a firm
dough, somewhat like a biscuit dough.  Knead for 10-15 minutes - the
more the dough is kneaded, the lighter the bread will be.  Shape the
dough into a ball, cover with a sheet of plastic and let it rest for
at least 1 hour. If left to rest overnight in the refrigerator, the
finished bread will be even lighter. When ready to bake, take a small
piece of dough about the size of a golf ball, or a bit smaller. On a
lightly floured board, roll the dough into a thin circle, about 5
inches in diameter. Repeat with all the dough. Heat a griddle or
heavy-bottomed iron skillet until it is very hot (you will notice the
smoke rising from it). Place the rolled out chapati on the griddle
and let it cook for 2-3 minutes, depending on how thin you have
rolled it. Using a pair of kitchen tongs, you can lift the chapati to
see if the underside has turned a golden brown. Flip, and cook the
other side about 1 minute. As they are cooked, store the chapatis on
a towel in a warm covered container until ready to serve. Serve as
soon as the last chapati is baked. NOTE: In India breads sometimes
are baked in the fiery clay tandoor, where they develop brown spots
and bubbles. To achieve a similar effect at home, you can use tongs
to hold each chapati over a hot gas flame until it puffs like a
little balloon. The chapati will collapse as it cools.
