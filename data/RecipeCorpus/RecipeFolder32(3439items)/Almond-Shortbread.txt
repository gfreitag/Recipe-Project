Title: Almond Shortbread
Categories: Desserts, Breads
Yield: 1 recipe
2/3 c  Sliced blanched almonds,
-chopped
1/2 lb (2 sticks) butter, at
-room temperature
1/2 c  Sugar
2 1/2 c  Flour
1 ts Almond extract
1    Lemon (large) zest
In a saucepan over low heat, heat the almonds until they are lightly
colored, stirring often to prevent burning.  Remove from heat.

In mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar until smooth and creamy.  Add
the flour, almond extract, and lemon zest; thoroughly combine.  Stir
in toasted almonds by hand.

Grease a 13- by 9-inch pan.  Using your fingers, pat dough firmly
into pan. Bake in a preheated, 350 degrees F. oven for 30 minutes, or
until lightly browned.  Immediately cut into bars. (If you wait until
the bars are completely cool to cut them, they will crumble.)  For a
little different shape, try cutting them in diamonds. (To do so, make
5 cuts lengthwise down the long edge.  Make 8 or 9 other cuts on the
diagonal.) Cool bars completely in pan, then remove.  Store in an
airtight container.

Makes 40 to 45 bars.

NOTE:  This shortbread calls for zest, which is the outer, colored
skin
of citrus fruit (not the white pith).  Its fragrant oils add
flavor to food.
