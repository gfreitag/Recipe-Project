Title: Cajun Chicken
Categories: Cajun/creol, Poultry
Yield: 1 servings
I have an excellent chicken
-recipe.  I use a cajun
-spice put out by
Tony Chachere.
2 md Boneless, Skinless Chicken
-Breasts
1 1/2 tb Butter
1/8 ts Adolph's Meat Tenderizer
-(Adds Flavor, But Be
-Careful
As This Contains MSG)
1/2 ea To 1Tbls    Cajun Spice
Place butter in teflon pan, sprinkle Adolph's on chicken and place
this in the pan.  Sprinkle spice on both sides.  Cook on med-low for
10 min. After that turn heat to med to med-high.  Cook chicken on
both sides. I move mine around a lot.  Don't get too much spice or
Adolph's or it will taste too salty.  I tried this one day and my
family loves it and it is simple to cook.  I make mashed potatoes and
pour the left over butter on them.
