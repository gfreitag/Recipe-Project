Title: LEMON GRANITA
Categories: Desserts, Fruit, Italian
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Water
1 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Freshly squeezed lemon juice
PLACE A NON-REACTIVE roasting pan or gratin dish in the freezer. Bring
sugar and water to a boil in a saucepan, stirring occasionally to
dissolve sugar. Cool the syrup. Stir in the lemon juice and pour
through a fine strainer to eliminate any seeds or pulp. Pour into the
prepared pan and return to the freezer. When the mixture starts to
freeze, stir every 10 minutes or so, scraping the frozen mixture from
the bottom and sides of the pan and mixing it with the
as-yet-unfrozen mixture. When there is no longer any unfrozen liquid
in the pan, pack the granita into a chilled container and press
plastic wrap against the surface. Serve within a few hours for best
texture. If the granita freezes to a solid block, pop it out of the
container and cut into thick slices with a stainless steel knife.
Chop the slices finely, replace in the container and freeze until
serving time. Serve the granita in chilled stem glasses. Substitute
lime or grapefruit juice for distinctly different flavors.
