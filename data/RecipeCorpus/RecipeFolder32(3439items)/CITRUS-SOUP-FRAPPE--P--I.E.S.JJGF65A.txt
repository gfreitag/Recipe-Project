appreciate being enlightened.
Robbie I never tried making this soup.It really isn't something I
would enjoy.I sent it along because,the authors of the book are
infallable.Nothing the bride or I have made following there recipe to
a "T" has been anything other than delicious.I would be interested in
knowing your taste bud's reaction to said recipe.I am at a loss as to
what kirsch is.Maybe Elaine,or Barb. might know.. Irwin E.In South
