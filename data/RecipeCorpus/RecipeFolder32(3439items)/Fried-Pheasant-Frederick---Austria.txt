Dredge pheasant in flour and seasonings, heat oil until very hot and
add pheasant. Brown on all sides and add garlic. Remove skillet from
fire and add broth. Pour sour cream over the top, don't stir. The
cream will seep down through the pheasant as it is baking. Cover
skillet and place in a 350 oven for thirty minutes.
