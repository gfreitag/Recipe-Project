Title: Sorrel Omelet
Categories: Vegetarian, Guestchefs
Yield: 1 servings
20    Sorrel leaves -- the stems
Removed
3 ts Butter
3    Eggs
2 tb Water
Salt
Freshly milled pepper
2 tb Cream
CUT THE SORREL LEAVES into strips, melt half the butter in an omelet
pan and cook the leaves until they have wilted and turned a
gray-green color. This will take just a minute or two. Lightly beat
the eggs with the water, season with salt and pepper, then Bring it
to a boil and let it reduce enough just to thicken slightly. Make a
slice down the center of the omelet, pour in the cream and serve.
