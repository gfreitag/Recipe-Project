Title: Rosemary Mustard Focaccia
Categories: Breadmaker, Breads
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Water
2 tb Water (only if needed)
1/4 c  Rosemary leaves
1/3 c  Grainy mustard
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Cornmeal
2 c  Flour
1 c  Whole-wheat flour
1 tb Yeast
Place all ingredients in the machine, program for knead and first
rise. Press start.  Add just enough extra water until the dough forms
a relaxed dough.  At the end of the final cycle, shape the dough into
a 10" disk and place it either on a pizza peel or baking sheet that
has been sprinkled with cornmeal.  Cover the dough with a clean cloth
and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk.  Preheat the
oven to 450 with the rack or pizza stone in center position.  Just
before baking, use your fingertips to make 1/2" dimples in the top of
the dough.  Slide the pan into the oven and bake for 17 to 20
minutes.  Cool the focaccia slightly before cutting into wedges.  Or
cool it completely, slice it in half horizontally, fill it with
cheese and/or meat, then cut it into wedges to make sandwiches.
