Title: BASIC PIZZA DOUGH - Country Living
Categories: Breads, Pizza
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  To 2 1/2 C unsifted all
-purpose flour
1 pk Rapid-rising dry yeast
1/2 ts Salt
2/3 c  Very warm water (120' to
130    F)
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Honey
Yield: 1 pizza

1. In large bowl, combine 2 C flour, the yeast, and salt. In 1-C
measuring cup, combine water, oil, and honey; stir into flour mixture
until soft dough forms.

2. Turn dough out onto floured surface. Knead dough, adding some of
remaining flour, if necessary, until dough is very elastic-10 to 15
minutes (dough should be soft, do not add too much flour).

3. Wash, dry, and lightly oil mixing bowl. Place dough in oiled bowl,
turning to bring oiled side up. Cover with clean cloth; let dough
rise in warm place, away from drafts, until double in size-30 to 45
minutes. Shape and bake following specific pizza recipes.

DOUGH VARIATIONS Whole Wheat: Prepare dough as above but reduce
all-purpose flour to 1 C and add 1 C whole-wheat flour.

Cornmeal: Prepare dough as above but reduce all-purpose flour to 1
1/2 C and add 1/2 C  cornmeal.

Parmesan: Prepare dough as above but add 1/4 C  grated Parmesan
cheese. Semolina: Prepare dough as above but reduce flour to 1 1/2 C
and add 1/2 C semolina flour to the dough.

Using Active Dry Yeast: Replace 1 pk rapid-rising dry yeast with 1 pk
active dry yeast. In large bowl, sprinkle yeast over warm water (11O'
to 115'F) and let sit 5 minutes. Add remaining ingredients, knead,
and set aside as above. Rising time should change from 30 minutes to
50 to 60 minutes or until double in size.

Overnight: Prepare dough as above, but do not allow to rise. Loosely
wrap and refrigerate dough immediately. Next day, unwrap dough and
cover with clean cloth. Let warm to room temperature and shape
following recipe directions. This method is best using active dry
yeast rather than the rapid-rising variety.
