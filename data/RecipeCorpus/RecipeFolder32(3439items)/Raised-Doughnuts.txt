Title: Raised Doughnuts
Categories: Breadmaker, Breakfast
Yield: 18 servings
1/2 c  Warm water
3    Eggs
3 tb Unsalted butter -- softened
2 tb Nonfat dry milk
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Mace
1 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
3 c  Flour
1 tb Yeast
Place all the ingredients in the machine, program for knead and first
rise and press start.  At the end of the final cycle, transfer the
dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and place
in a warm, draft-free place, and allow to rise for an additional 30
minutes. You can also do this step in the machine by punching the
dough down, closing the machine, and letting the dough rise for 30
minutes.  Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut it in
half to make it more manageable. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes.
Roll it out to 1/3" thick. Flour a doughnut cutter and cut out
doughnuts. Lift each doughnut, pat it to remove excess flour, and
place it on a lightly oiled or sprayed baking sheet. Cover the
doughnuts with a clean towel and let rise until doubled in bulk,
about 1 hour.  Put 1/2 cup powdered sugar in sturdy paper bag and
spread out paper towels near frying pan. Heat 2" oil in a medium
saucepan or deep fryer to 375.  Slide 2 or 3 doughnuts at a time into
the hot oil. Turn them frequently and spoon the hot oil over them
until they are well puffed. Drain the doughnuts on paper towels and
shake them with the sugar in the bag while they are still warm.
