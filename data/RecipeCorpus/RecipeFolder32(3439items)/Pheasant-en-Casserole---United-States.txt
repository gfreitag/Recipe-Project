Clean and pluck a young pheasant, truss the bird and place it in a
large skillet with the butter. Cook very slowly for twenty minutes
and transfer the bird to an earthenware casserole. Pour the butter
from the skillet over the pheasant and add the grapes, orange pieces,
salmis sauce and pomegranate juice. Simmer for ten minutes and serve
in the casserole with a dish of bread crumbs, soaked in butter, on
the side.
