lemon juice

Cook the pheasant in a little butter. Make sure your sauce pan is big
enough to hold the pheasant and the diced onion. When the cooking is
three quarters done, sprinkle the bird with the cream or with regular
cream acidulated with a few drops of lemon juice. Finish the cooking,
baste often with the cream and serve in the sauce pan.
