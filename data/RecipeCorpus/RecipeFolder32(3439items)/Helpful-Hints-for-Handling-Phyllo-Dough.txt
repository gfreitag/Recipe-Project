MMMMM-------------------HANDLING PHYLLO DOUGH------------------------
If possible, buy phyllo that has not been frozen. It can be found in
the refrigerator section of most Greek and some Middle Eastern delis.

Let the package come to room temperature before opening it. The
sheets are easier to work with at room temperature.

Remove the sheets you are working with and spray or brush them with
oil, butter or nonstick cooking spray as quickly as possible. Keep
the unused portions covered with a towel or plastic wrap. Work
quickly; do not expose reserved sheets to the air or they will dry
out and disintegrate.

Sprinkle bread crumbs between the layers to keep them from sticking
together when they bake; this is particularly helpful if you plan to
refrigerate or freeze the recipe before baking.

Some cooks work on a lightly dampened towel, but I find it makes the
dough soggy.
