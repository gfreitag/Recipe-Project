Title: PANKO SHRIMP
Categories: Seafood, Appetizers, Japanese
Yield: 6 servings
1 lb Shrimp (26 to 30)
2 c  Panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
1 c  Flour
2    Eggs
Oil for frying
1    Lemon
Soy sauce for dipping

Peel and devein shrimp,but leave tails attached.Wash well in salted
water until water runs clear.This will be 5 or 6 changes of water.Dry
on paper towels. Beat eggs in a bowl.Pour flour and panko onto
separate pieces of waxed paper. Holding a shrimp by the tail,roll it
in the flour,egg and panko. Place on cookie sheet.Repeat with
remaining shrimp.This may be done several hours in advance,but keep
them in the refrigerator. Heat oil in a pan to 350 degrees.Deep-fry
shrimp until they turn light golden brown.You may need to do this in
several batches,because if you crowd out the pan,they will not brown
properly.Drain on paper towels. Cut lemon in half lengthwise,cut each
half in half.You will have 8 long wedges.Serve with soy sauce to dip
and lemon on side.You can squeeze the lemon either on the shrimp or
in the soy sauce or both.

Note:The Japanese eat a lot of foods at room temperature and fried
food coated with panko stays crisp for several hours,hence it is good
picnic food.This dish is served as an appetizer course in a Japanese
meal but would also make a good hors d'oeuvre at a Western-style
party.
