Title: Spicy Bell Pepper Jelly
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 2 cups
2    Red bell peppers
2    Yellow bell peppers
2    Green bell peppers
8    Red serrano chiles
2 c  Sugar
Slice or julienne the peppers and chiles, but do not remove the
seeds. Mix in the sugar and let the mixture sit overnight in the
refrigerator. The next day, cook the mixture over low heat for 10-15
minutes without adding any liquid. The peppers and chiles mixed with
sugar will create their own liquid. Cool the jelly and serve at room
temperature. Serve with rack of lamb.
