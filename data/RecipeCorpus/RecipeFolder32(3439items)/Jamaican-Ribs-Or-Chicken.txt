Title: Jamaican Ribs Or Chicken
Categories: Bbq/grill, Poultry
Yield: 1 servings
Ribs or 1 chicken cut up
3/4 c  Onions -- chopped
4 lg Clove
Peppers SEE DIRECTIONS
2 tb Allspice
1 tb Vinegar
2 tb Salad oil
1 ts Nutmeg
1 ts Salt
12    Bay leaf soaked in hot water
1    Hour
Garlic -- minced
PEPPERS: You can control the heat with the type of peppers you use.
Between the marinade and the cooking, a lot of the heat will be lost,
so dont be afraid to throw a couple of whatever hot peppers you have
on hand. I use 2 large cayennes, 2-4 chilies, an The preperation:
combine everything except the bay leafs and the meat in a large zip
lock bag. Add meat and thouroughly mix. Let marinate in the fridge at
least 2 hours preferably until the next day. Fire up the bbq. Remove
meat fromthe bag wiuth as much as the marinade as possible still
clinging to it. Place half of the bay leafs on the meat. Dump the
remaining marinade or use it as insect repellant. Cook very slowly
over medium heat turning often. I After 1/2 hour remove the bay leaf,
turn meat, place the remaining bay leaves on the meat and cook till
done (About 1/2-3/4 hours more depending on the heat). Eat. Break out
the beer. You'll need it.
