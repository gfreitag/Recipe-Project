MAKE CORNBREAD:  The night before, make the cornbread.  Preheat oven
to 425 degrees F.

Thinly coat the bottom of a standard Pyrex pie plate, or 9-inch square
baking pan, with vegetable oil. Put pan in oven while it is
preheating and you are mixing the cornbread batter.

In a mixing bowl, blend together the cornmeal, flour, salt and baking
powder. Stir in the egg and about 3 T vegetable oil. Add milk and mix
thoroughly by hand. The consistency should be a thick, but not
"doughy," liquid.  It may be necessary to add a little more milk.
Pour into preheated pan and bake for 30 minutes or until slightly
brown on top.

Let cool in pan for 30 minutes.  Remove from pan and break up into
very large chunks in a large mixing bowl. Let stand overnight,
uncovered. This will ensure that it is dry and stale.

MAKE TURKEY BROTH:  The night before, make the turkey broth.  Bring
about 12 C of water to a boil in a large pot. Thoroughly rinse turkey
neck, giblets and gizzard. Add turkey parts, onion, celery leaves and
celery stalk to water, cover and reduce heat to a low simmer. Simmer
on very low heat for 2 hours. Strain the broth, cover, cool quickly
and refrigerate.
