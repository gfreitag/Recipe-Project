Title: THREE PEPPER PIZZA
Categories: Pizza, Italian
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  EACH of red,yellow and green
-peppers,cut into 1/2"
-pieces
2 tb Garlic olive oil,plus more
-as needed
8    Mushrooms,sliced
Pizza dough with oregano
Oil and cornmeal for pan
1 c  Mozzarella cheese,grated
3/4 c  Pizza sauce with oregano
1/3 c  Black olives,sliced
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese,freshly
-grated
In a medium saucepan over low heat,slowly cook peppers in the oil
until half done,about 10 minutes.Drain peppers on paper towels and
reserve the oil. In a bowl,lightly toss the sliced mushrooms with 1
tsp. of oil until coated.Set aside. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.Roll
out the prepared pizza dough on a floured surface.Lightly grease the
pizza pan with a little oil and sprinkle with cornmeal.Place the
dough in the pizza pan and trim edges.Bake for 10 minutes.Remove from
oven and lightly brush the crust with a little more oil.(This helps
stop topping from leaking and causing a soggy crust.)Sprinkle with
half of the mozzarella and all the sauce.Top with peppers,mushrooms
and olives.Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and top with freshly
grated Parmesan.Bake on oven's bottom rack for 20 minutes.

Variation: This is the most "Italian" of the pizzas I've done so you
might want to add 1 or 2 Italian sausages (this flavored with
fennel), which have been sauteed,drained on paper towels and
crumbled(you should have 1/2 cup to 1 cup).Strew over pizza along
with the peppers.
