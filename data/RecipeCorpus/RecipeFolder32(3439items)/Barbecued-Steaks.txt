Title: Barbecued Steaks
Categories: Bbq/grill, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
3 lb Top round steak
4 tb Mustard -- prepared
2 tb Lemon juice
1. Pound steak on both sides with a wooden mallet or the edge of a
heavy plate. 2. Combine lemon juice and mustard and spread over both
sides of steak. Allow to stand 4-5 hours at room temperature. 3.
Broil steaks about 4 inches above glowing coals on barbecue grill for
4-5 minutes on each side, or until desired degree of doneness is

very good and flavorful steak.
