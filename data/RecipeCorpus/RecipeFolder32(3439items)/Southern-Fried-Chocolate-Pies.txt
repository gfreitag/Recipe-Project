* Use peanut, safflower or solid vegetable shortening for frying. 1.
For crust: sift flour and salt together; cut in the shortening with a
pastry blender or 2 knifes, until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.
2. Add ice water, a little at a time while tossing with a fork, until
dough holds together. Do not get too moist. 3. Roll out dough to 1/8
inch thick. Cut into circles about five inches in diameter. 4. Mix
cocoa powder with the sugar. Place 2-3 tablespoons of this mixture
onto one half of the circle and place 3 very thin slices of cold
margarine on top. Fold opp 5. Pour oil to a depth of about 1/2 inch
in a heavy skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until very hot. Place
pies in a single layer in oil and fry, turning to brown each side. An
iron skillet works best. Serve hot, warm, or cold.
