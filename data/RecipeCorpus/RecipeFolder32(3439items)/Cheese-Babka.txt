MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Dry cottage cheese or

1/3 c  Sugar
1 1/2 tb Sour cream or creme fraiche
1 1/2 tb Flour
1    Egg
1    Lemon, zest only
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
3 tb Currants, plunged in

1. Sprinkle yeast and sugar over warm water in a small bowl and stir
to dissolve. Let stand until foamy, about 10 mintes.

2. In a large bowl, combine butter, sugar, salt, vanilla, almond,
milk, eggs, and 1 cup flour. Beat until smooth with a whisk. Add
yeast mixture. Beat 3 minutes or until smooth. Add flour, 1/2 cup at
a time with a wooden spoon until a soft dough has formed.

3. Turn dough out onto a lighly floured surface and knead until
smooth and silky, about 5 minutes. Be sure dough remains soft. Place
in a greased bowl, turn once to grease top, and cover with plastic
wrap. Let rise in a warm area until until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.
Meanwhile combine filling ingredients in a bowl, beat until creamy.

4. Gently deflate dough, turn out onto a lightly floured board and
roll or pat into a 10 x 12 inch rectangle. Brush with melted butter.
Spread with filling, leaving a 1/2 inch border all around the dough.
Roll up jelly roll fashion and pinch seams. Holding one end, twist
dough about 6 to 8 times to make a rope. Form into a flat coil and
place in a well-greased 10 to 12 cup Kugelhupf mold or tube pan.
Pinch ends together and adjust dough to lie evenly in the pan, no
more than 2/3 full. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise till
even with the top of the pan, about 45 minutes.

5. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or
until golden brown and a cake tester comes out clean. There will be a
hollow sound when tapped. Let stand for 5 minutes in the pan, then
transfer from baking pan to a rack to cool completely. Let stand 4
hours or overnight, wrapped in plastic before slicing.

6. Dust with powdered sugar or drizzle powdered sugar glaze.
