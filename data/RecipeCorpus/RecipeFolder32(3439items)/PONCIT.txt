NOTES:

*  Filipino cabbage in garlic and soy sauce -- I got this from Lynne
Fitzsimmons who got it from a Filipino friend of her mother's.

*  You will need a big frying pan to fit all the ingredients.  You may
leave out the salt and MSG if you like. I have successfully used
lightly-microwaved bacon as the meat.
