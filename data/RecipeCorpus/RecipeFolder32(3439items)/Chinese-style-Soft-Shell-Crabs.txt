Title: Chinese-style Soft-Shell Crabs
Categories: Asian, Chinese, Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 2 servings
4 lg Soft-shell crabs
-OR_
6 sm Soft-shell crabs
1 lg Handful scallions, slivered
1 sm Handful fresh ginger,
-slivered
Soy sauce
Sherry
Sesame oil
Prepare crabs for cooking: thaw, rinse, pat dry, remove apron and
gills. Sprinkle with cornstarch.

Make sure that you are wearing long sleeves and the kitchen fan is on
full blast.

In a large skillet heat a couple tablespoons of peanut oil to the
smoking point.  Toss in the crabs.  Immediately clap the lid on the
skillet; when the initial clatter dies down, remove the lid or put it
ajar.  Cook until crisp, maybe 2 minutes.  Flip and cook the other
side.  When they're done (? 4 minutes, I haven't any idea ?), toss in
ginger and scallions; stir fry for a minute.  Add soy and sherry to
taste (I use about 1 tablespoon of each) and shake skillet around
over high heat until sauce is mostly absorbed.

Arrange on a serving platter and drizzle a little sesame oil over.

The restaurants make the sauce separately:  Boil the sauce ingedients
and thicken with a little cornstarch water; when the crabs are fried,
put them on a platter and pour the sauce over.

The advantage to the restaurant method is that the crabs are a little
crisper; the advantages to my method is that the crabs absorb more
flavor from the sauce and the meat comes out fluffier.
