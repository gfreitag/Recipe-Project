Although this souffle is delicious on its own or with single cream,
try it with a sauce made from (scottish) raspberries - you will find
the combination superb.

Lightly butter a souffle dish (2-pint for 4 servings) and sprinkle it
which caster sugar.

Melt the butter, stir in the flour, remove from the heat and gradually
blend in the milk. When the sauce is smooth return it to the heat and
bring it to the boil to thicken, stirring all the time. Stir in the
egg yolks one at a time, then beat in the caster sugar with the
Drambuie and vanilla essence.

Whisk the egg whites until they stand in soft peaks, then using a
metal spoon lightly and quickly fold them into the sauce mixture.

Turn the souffle into the dish and bake it in the middle of the oven
at 190 oC (375 oF) for about 40 minutes or until it is well risen and
golden brown.

Scatter a little icing sugar over the top then serve immediately.
