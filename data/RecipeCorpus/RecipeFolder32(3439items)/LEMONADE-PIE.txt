Title: LEMONADE PIE
Categories: Pie/tart, Appetizers, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
1    Lg Cool whip; partially thaw
1    Sm Lemonade; pink or regular
Rind ;  one lemon
FOLD altogether and put in baking dish to cut into squares after it
set up, or in a graham cracker pie crust. Place in refrigerator for
at least 12 hours. If it doesn't set up well, freeze for about 1/2
hour.
I've had it set up beautifully at times, and at other times really
be too runny to be pretty! A sprig of mint on top makes it especially
good to look at.
