Categories: Salads, Appetizers, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
1/2 lb Red potatoes
2 c  Cauliflower florets
1 md Carrot, julienned
1/4 lb Green beans, sliced
2 c  Green cabbage, shredded
1 c  Jicama, julienned
MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
1 c  Coconut milk
1/3 c  Crunchy peanut butter
1 lg Garlic clove, minced
3 tb Indonesian sweet soy sauce
3 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 ea Square inch of lemon zest
2 tb Brown sugar
1 ts Crushed hot red pepper
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Water
2 ea Scallions, thinly sliced
6 ea Cherry tomatoes
In a medium saucepan of boiling salted water, cook the potatoes until
tender, 12 to 20 minutes, depending on size; drain.  When cool enough
to handle, peel and slice.

In another saucepan of boiling salted water, cook the cauliflower
until just tender, about 3 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and
rinse under cold water; drain well.

In the same boiling water, repeat this process with the carrot, then
the green beans, and finally the cabbage.  (The jicama is not cooked.)

To make the dressing, in a medium saucepan, combine the coconut milk,
peanut butter, garlic, sweet soy sauce, lemon juice, lemon zest, brown
sugar, hot pepper, salt and 2 tablespoons of water.  Bring to a boil
over moderate heat, stirring frequently.  Reduce the heat to
moderately low and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.  Keep
warm over very low heat until ready to use.

Arrange the vegetables in layers in a large salad bowl.  Scatter the
scallions on top.  Garnish with tomatoes.  Pour the warm peanut butter
sauce over all.  Serve at room temperature.
