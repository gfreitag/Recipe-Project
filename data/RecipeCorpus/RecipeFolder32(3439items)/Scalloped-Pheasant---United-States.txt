Bone pheasants. Make dressing using bread, celery, sage, salt, pepper
and onion. Skim off one cup of the fat used in cooking the pheasant.
Use the remaining liquid to moisten dressing. Place dressing on the
bottom of a large casserole dish and place pheasant on top. Mix the
reserved broth with flour, eggs and milk. Add broth and flour and
cook until the consistency of custard. Pour over pheasant and bake at
350 for forty minutes or until set.
