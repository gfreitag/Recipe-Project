1/3 c  Chopped mint
This recipe keeps well.

RECIPE #1 green food coloring

Wash the apples, cut into pieces, do not core or peel.  Add water and
simmer slowly until the mixture becomes a thick pulp. Strain through
jelly bag. Measure juice and allow 2 cups sugar to each 2-1/2 cups
juice. This recipe should produce nearly 5 cups juice. Stir over low
heat until sugar has dissolved, then boil rapidly until setting point
is reached. Stir in the vinegar, mint, and a few drops of green food
coloring. Cool slightly, stir to distribute the mint, then put into
hot sterile jars. Cover, seal, and store.

Excellent when served with roast lamb.
