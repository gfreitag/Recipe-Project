This Normandy dish uses Calvados or Apple Brandy and is an easy
preparation which blends itself with other game birds as well.

In a large skillet, heat the butter and add the pheasant pieces,
which have been well seasoned. Cook for two minutes, do not brown.
Add the chopped onions and simmer for two more minutes, add the
Calvados and cider. Cover tightly and cook over low heat for forty
five minutes or until tender. Remove the pheasant to a warm platter
and keep hot. Slowly stir the cream into the pan and bring to a boil.
Add the egg yolks stirring constantly. Let the mixture simmer for one
hour, do not let it boil.

Combine and heat the onions, carrots and mushrooms. Drain off any
liquids, arrange vegetables on top of the pheasant. Pour the sauce
over all and serve.
