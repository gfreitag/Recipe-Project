This velvet-smooth mixture of chocolate and cream is kept at room
temperature and used for making truffles, dipping fruit or coating
various pastries such as eclairs or cookies.

1. Place the chocolate and cream in a heavy saucepan over moderate
heat. Stirring constantly, cook only until the mixture is warm and
most of the chocolate has melted. Remove from the heat and continue
stirring until the chocolate has completely melted and the ganache
mixture is smooth.

2. Pour the ganache through a strainer into a bowl and let it cool to
room temperature before using; it should not be warm to the touch.

3. Thoroughly mix the ganache before using; do not refrigerate or it
will set. It can be kept at room temperature, covered, for 2 days.
