Title: Powter Very Corny Corn Muffins
Categories: Muffins, Vegetables
Yield: 12 servings
1 c  Unbleached flour
1 c  Yellow cornmeal
4 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Sugar
1 lg Whole egg
2    Egg whites
1 1/4 c  1% milk
2 tb Canola oil
1 c  Canned cream corn
Preheat oven to 425.

In a bowl, combine dry ingredients. In another bowl, combine egg, egg
whites, milk, oil, and corn. Stir wet ingredients into dry until they
are just moist.  Do not overmix. Lightly grease a muffin tin or use
12 paper muffin cups or use a nonstick muffin tin. Spoon mixture into
cups.

Bake in oven 20-25 mins, until muffins are golden brown.

My note:  Made these with chili (or bean stew if Wes is reading, since
there was no meat).  Spooned it right on the muffin instead of using
margerine.  It was great!  Kids wolfed em too!
