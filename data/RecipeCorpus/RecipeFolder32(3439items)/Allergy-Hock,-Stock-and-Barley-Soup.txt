Rinse off bones quickly in cold water and trim off all excess fat.
Place in large soup pot and cover with cold water.  Bring to a boil
and simmer for at least one hour.  Cool.  Skim off fat and scum.
Meanwhile, put the split peas, lentils and the barley into a bowl.
Cover with boiling water and allow to soak for an hour or so while
the bones are cooking. Drain them and add to soup pot.  Simmer an
additional hour. Add the onion, celery, potato, carrots, macaroni,
juice, salt and pepper and worchestershire sauce. Simmer another hour
occassionally stirring to prevent lentils, barley and peas from
sinking to the bottom and scorching. Remove bones, pick off meat and
return meat to soup pot.  If possible, allow to cool and sit
overnight as the flavour will be better the next day. Origin: The
