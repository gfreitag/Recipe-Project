This dish should be cooked in a very large sauce pan. Saute pheasant
on all sides in the butter. Add the onions and close lid tightly,
cook gently for forty minutes.

Cut celery into two inch pieces and cook for ten minutes in salted
boiling water. Drain. Combine the celery and the pheasant together
with the cream, seasonings and stock. Cover and continue cooking
