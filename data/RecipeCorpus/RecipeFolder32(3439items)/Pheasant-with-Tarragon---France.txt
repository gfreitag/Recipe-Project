Combine flour, salt and pepper and coat pheasant pieces, reserve any
leftover flour. Brown lightly on all sides in melted butter for four
or five minutes. Cut the shallots very fine and spread over pheasant.
Simmer for a few minutes. Add wine, chicken broth and herbs, using
only the stems of the tarragon and saving leaves for the sauce. Cover
and simmer for twenty five minutes or until the pheasant is tender.

To make the sauce, add to the pan juices, the cream and the remaining
flour. Simmer gently until the sauce thickens. Strain the sauce over
the pheasant, garnish with the tarragon leaves, whole or chopped.
