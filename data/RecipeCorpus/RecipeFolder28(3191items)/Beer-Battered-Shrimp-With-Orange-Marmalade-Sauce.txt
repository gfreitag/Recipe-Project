Title: Beer-Battered Shrimp With Orange Marmalade Sauce
Categories: Seafood, Beer
Yield: 1 servings
-vegetable oil for
-deep-frying
-fresh lemon juice (about 1
-tsp)
-Orange Marmalade Sauce
-(recipe follows)
-Orange slices and fresh
-parsley for garnish
1 c  Flour, sifted
1 1/2 ts Hungarian paprika (not the
-tasteless American stuff)
-salt and pepper to taste
1 c  Beer
1 lb Jumbo shrimp (16-20 per
-pound)
-flour for dredging
Try the batter with mussels and oysters as well.

After sifting the flour well, combine it with the other dry
ingredients. Gradually add the beer, stirring well with a wire
whisk. The consistency of the batter should be that of rather thin
pancake batter. Chill for 5-10 minutes.

Shell and devein the shrimp. With a sharp knife, cut the back nearly
in half to form into a fantail shape. Sprinkle with fresh lemon juice
and a little salt. Holding the shrimp by their tails, dip them into
the flour first and then into the beer batter. Deep-fry in vegetable
oil at 350 degrees. Be careful to place the shrimp one at a time into
the oil so that the do not stick together. Fry until crisp and golden
brown, a few minutes should do it. Serve with Orange Marmalade Sauce.
Garnish the platter with orange slices and fresh parsley. Serves 2-4,
depending on appetites.
