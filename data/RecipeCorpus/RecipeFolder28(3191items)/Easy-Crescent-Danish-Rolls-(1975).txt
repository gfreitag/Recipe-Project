1975 Pillsbury Bake Off Winner Heat oven to 350 degrees. In small
bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar and lemon juice; beat until smooth.
Separate dough into 8 rectangles; firmly press perforations to seal.
Spread each rectangle with about 2 T cream cheese mixture.  Starting
at longer side, roll up each rectangle, firmly pinching edges and
ends to seal. Gently stretch each roll to about 10 inches.  On
ungreased large cookie sheet, coil each roll into a spiral with seam
on the inside, tucking end under. Make deep indentation in center of
each roll; fill with 1/2 t preserves. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 to
25 minutes or until deep golden brown. In small bowl, blend all glaze
ingredients, adding enough milk for desired drizzling consistency.
Drizzle over warm rolls. Barbara S. Gibson, IN. Submitted By TERRI
