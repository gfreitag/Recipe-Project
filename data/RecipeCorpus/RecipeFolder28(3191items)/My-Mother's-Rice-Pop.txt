My Mother's Rice Pop (Ann
-Mitchell)
Rice
Milk
Cinnamon sticks
3-4 eggs, well beaten
She cooks the rice in milk <she always used whole milk>.  Pour the
milk over the rice as if you were cooking it in water - 1 inch above
the rice....put in 2-3 cinnamon sticks while cooking. When the rice
is done, take off heat and add 3 - 4 already beaten eggs...mom said
to beat this fast - the heat of the rice will cook the eggs - and add
your sugar/brown/honey - whatever you choose to sweeten it with!
Total "comfort" food! Don't forget the vanilla in the Rice Pop
Recipe! One tsp should do it! This did originate from my Grandmother
<of Polish decent - but cooked for a very hard working German farmer>.
