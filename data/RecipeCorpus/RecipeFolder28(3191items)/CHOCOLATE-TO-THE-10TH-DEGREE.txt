Title: CHOCOLATE TO THE 10TH DEGREE
Categories: Information, Chocolate, Godiva
Yield: 1 servings   From White & Light to Dark & Dense

by Tish Boyle

As chocolate lovers, we're always in quest of the ultimate rich,
dense but deftly realized chocolate experience. Still, there are many
occasions when a lighter chocolate touch is called for -- when the
main course itself is on the heavy side, during summer months, or for
more informal affairs.

Therefore! To celebrate the versatility of "the food of the gods"; to
employ that food with its classic combinations -- chocolate with
caramel, coconut, mocha, orange etc.; to bring recipes of all kinds
and for each and every occasion to the table; and to hit every note
on the chocolate scale, we present ten recipes that glide smoothly
forward from an ethereal white chocolate mousse to the introductions
of cocoa and mocha, with milk chocolate making its presence felt
gradually until it announces itself with a splash in Individual
Chocolate Cakes, while dark chocolate tiptoes from mere taste to
complete triumph with the Dark Chocolate Terrine. Choose your own
adventure.
