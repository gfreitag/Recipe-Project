Preparation Time: 2:10 1. Prepare each cake mix according to package
directions, baking each in a greased and floured 9 x 13-inch baking
pan. When cool, remove cakes from pans, wrap well in foil, and freeze.

2. When ready to assemble, prepare mocha butter cream frosting as
follows: In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and butter with an
electric mixer on high speed until smooth and well blended, 2 to 3
mins. Add cocoa and coffee powder; beat well. With mixer on medium,
gradually add powdered sugar and when incorporated, turn to high and
beat until light and fluffy.

3. To assemble cake, place one frozen cake on a large rectangular
platter or tray. Cover with raspberry jam. Top with a second cake
layer and cover with orange marmalade. Place remaining cake on top.
Frost top and sides with mocha butter cream. Refrigerate until ready
to serve.

4. Decorate top with fresh (nontoxic) flowers, chocolate-dipped
strawberries, colored sprinkles, or piping.
