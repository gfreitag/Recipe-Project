Categories: Breads, Diabetic
Yield: 14 biscuits
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1 t  Baking soda
1/2 t  Salt
2 c  Unbleached white flour
2 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
1 T  Baking powder
MMMMM----------------------WET INGREDIENTS---------------------------
2 T  Fruit sweetener
10 T  Cold butter
1 7/8 c  Buttermilk
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment
paper. Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl. Cut the butter
into 1/2 inch pieces. Use the fingers and thumb of each hand to rub
in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Be sure to
lift your hands out of the bowl while simultaneously using your
thumbs to run the flour and butter across your fingers. Make a well
in the center. In a small bowl, combine the buttermilk and fruit
sweetener. Pour them into the center of the dry ingredients. Form a
rough dough, mixing quickly and gently with your hands or a wooden
spoon. Place the biscuit dough on a lightly floured work surface, and
knead it no more than 10 times. Use a rolling pin or your hands to
form it into a 3/4 inch thick rectangle. Lightly dust a plan 2-inch
or 3-inch cutter with flour. Cut the biscuits with a straight cutting
motion, being careful not to twist the cutter. To reuse the scraps,
do not knead them. Instead use your fingers to lightly press them
together and pat them out to make a 3/4 inch thickness. Place the cut
biscuits on a baking paper lined or ungreased baking sheet. Leave at
least 1 inch of space around each biscuit for crusty evenly browned
biscuits. Bake the biscuits in the preheated oven for 20-22 minutes,
until golden brown. Let the biscuits cool on the baking sheet before
removing them. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   03-11-95
