Categories: Desserts, Chocolate, Godiva
Yield: 16 wedges
8 tb Unsalted butter, softened
1 c  Packed dark brown sugar
2 lg Eggs
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Small pecan halves
3 oz Swiss white chocolate,
-coarsely chopped
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
6 oz Swiss dark chocolate,
-divided
3 oz Swiss milk chocolate,
-divided
3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/8 ts Salt
Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325
degrees F.
Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 12-inch diameter pizza
pan.
Melt the unsweetened chocolate according to the melting
instructions in
the Chocolate Key. Cool until the chocolate is tepid.

Chop the bittersweet and milk chocolates into 1/2-inch squares
and set
aside. In a small bowl, using a wire whisk, stir together the
flour and
salt.

In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at medium
speed,
beat the butter and brown sugar for 1 to 2 minutes, until the
mixture is
light in texture and beige in color. One at a time, beat in the
eggs,
mixing well after each addition. Beat in the melted chocolate and
vanilla until blended. At low speed, beat in the flour mixture
just
until combined.

Using a rubber spatula, fold in half of the chopped bittersweet
and milk
chocolate squares and half of the pecans. Scrape the batter into
the
prepared pan and using a spatula, evenly smooth the surface.
Sprinkle
the surface with the remaining chopped chocolate pieces and
pecans.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a cake tester or toothpick
inserted
2 inches away from the center comes out clean. Transfer the pan
to a
wire rack to cool.

Melt the white chocolate according to the melting instructions in
the Chocolate Key. Fill a small paper cone with the melted white
chocolate and cut a 1/3-inch opening at the tip. Drizzle the white
chocolate over the surface of the pan. Cut into wedges to serve.
