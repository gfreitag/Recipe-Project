Title: Oklahoma Brown Candy  RBTN28A
Categories: Candies
Yield: 24 servings
1/4 lb Butter or margarine
1 ts Vanilla
1 lb 1 or 2 lbs. pecans
6 c  Sugar
2 c  Whole milk or cream
1/4 ts Soda
Pour 2 cups sugar into heavy aluminum or iron skillet and place over
low heat. Begin stirring with a wooden spoon and keep sugar moving so
that it does not burn. It will take approximately 1/2 hour to melt
sugar completely. At no time let it smoke or cook so fast that the
sugar turns dark. It should be the color of light brown sugar syrup.
As soon as you have the sugar starting to heat in the skillet, pour
remaining 4 cups sugar and milk or cream into a deep, heavy kettle.
Set over low heat to cook slowly while you are melting sugar in
skillet. As soon as all sugar is melted, begin pouring it into kettle
of boiling milk and sugar, keeping it on very low heat, while
stirring constantly. The real secret to mixing these ingredients is
to pour a very fine stream from the skillet. Continue cooking and
stirring until mixture forms firm ball (245 degrees) when dropped
into cold water. Remove from heat and immediately add soda, stirring
vigorously as it foams up. Add butter, allowing it to melt as you
stir. Let cool for 20 minutes. Add vanilla and heat (using a wooden
spoon) until mixture is thick and heavy, having a dull appearance
instead of a glossy sheen. Add pecans and mix. Turn into a large pan
and cut into squares when cooled slightly. Candy keeps moist and
delicious indefinitely. It is most attractive when decorated with a
sprig of holly.
