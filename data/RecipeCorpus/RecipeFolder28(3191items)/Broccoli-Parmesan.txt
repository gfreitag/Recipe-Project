Remove the thick stems from the broccoli. (You can keep the stems to
peel, cut into slivers, and use in a vegetable stir-fry for another
meal.) Cut larger flower heads into easy-to-eat sized pieces. (You
should have about 6 to 7 cups of florets.) Steam, cook in microwave
(or boil in water if you must but a lot of flavor is lost in the
cooking water) until tender.

Warm the olive oil in a skillet and add chopped onions and red
peppers. Cook until tender and then add soft bread crumbs and cook
until crumbs are golden. Remove from heat and mix in the Parmesan
cheese.

To serve, toss the cooked broccoli with the crumb mixture until nicely
mixed together.
