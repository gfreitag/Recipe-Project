Title: Original Authentic Haggis
Categories: Meats, Nuts/grains
Yield: 6 servings
Sheep heart
6 oz Mutton suet
1 c  Scotch oatmeal
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Stomach of a sheep
Salt
Sheep lights (lungs)
Sheep liver
Procure the stomach of a sheep and wash the bags in several waters,
rubbing them well with salt. Then scald them in boiling water, and
scrape them carefully with a knife. Soak them in a strong brine for
12 hours, trimming off any sinewy parts or pieces of gristle.
Meanwhile, wash the lights, liver, and heart, and hang them up to dry
for 12 hours; then put them in a saucepan with plenty of water and
boil them gently. Take the small stomach bag with the windpipe
attached, and wash it free from the brine. Put it into another
saucepan with plenty of water, with the windpipe hanging outside of
the pan, and boil it slowly for about two hours. Rub about a third of
the liver through a wire sieve. Chop the small stomach bag and mutton
suet rather coarsely. Mix these with the liver, adding 1 heaped
breakfastcupful Scotch oatmeal. Season the mixture with salt and
pepper to taste, and moisten with about 1 breakfastcupful of the
liquor in which the lights, etc. were boiled. Let stand for a half
hour, stuff it into the large stomach bag, and sew it up securely
using a strong thread. Place the haggis into a large saucepan of
boiling water, and place a plate underneath to prevent it from
sticking to the pan. Boil it quickly for 1/ hours, pricking the bag
occasionally with a skewer to prevent it from bursting; add more
boiling water as needed. Serve the haggis on a hot dish as soon as it
is taken out of the pan together with mashed potatoes and bashed
turnip.

This is an old recipe of the Scottish national dish. Of course, today
we would use a plastic bag and perhaps take a couple of other
shortcuts, buts that's the old original way of doing it.
