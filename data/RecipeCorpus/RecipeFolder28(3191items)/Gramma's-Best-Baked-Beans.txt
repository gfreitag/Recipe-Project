"It took me years, to get these beans just exactly the way my family
likes them, and this is it." - Lori Norman

Soak beans overnight; drain, and add 6 cups cold water. Bring to a
boil, turn down heat, and simmer covered for 3/4 hour, or until just
bearly tender. Drain, and RESERVE the cooking water. In a 2-quart
casserole, layer: beans...bacon...onion and> a shake of pepper.
Continue layering...ending with pieces of bacon on top. In a small
saucepan, mix together: 2 cups reserved water, brown sugar, salt,
molasses and mustard. Bring to a boil, and pour over beans. Cover
beans, and bake at 275 degrees for 5 to 6 hours. Add a little more of
the reserved cooking water, if needed while baking. (Very seldom
needs it). The beans are usually done in 5 hours.

Note:  These are really good!  Nice thick and rich beans, no need for
catsup.  Don't cook beyond 5 hours though because they thicken when
you stop cooking them and if you cook too long, the liquid will cook
off. - Debbie Carlson
