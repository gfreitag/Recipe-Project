1/4 ts Pepper, black

2 tb Oil

1/4 c  Water
1 md Onions, chopped
1    Garlic cloves, crushed
1/2 ts Cumin, ground
1/2 ts Chili powder
1/2 tb Salt
MMMMM-----------------------COOKING WATER----------------------------
1 pt Water
1/2 tb Lard
1 ts Chili powder
Soak corn shucks in warm water 2 hours or overnight before using.

Fry onion, garlic, cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper, and raisins (if
desired) in hot oil.  Add meat and water and simmer until liquid has
been absorbed.

Work lard, chili powder, and salt into masa; knead with hands until
smooth. (Alternately, pour ingredients into breadmaker and start on
"manual.") Using back of spoon, spread masa mixture thinly and evenly
on inside of shuck, covering half the length of shuck.

Thinly spread 1 tb filling mixture on masa-covered portion of shuck.
Lap one side of shuck over the other, folding under portion of shuck
which does not contain masa.

Stack tamales, pyramid-fashion, on shallow steaming rack in bottom of
large cooker.  Add lard and chili powder to water and pour over
tamales. Cover with additional shucks and steam 4-5 hours.  Hint:
when masa is done, it will pull away from shucks when unfolded.

Sylvia's notes: Stokes' Green Chili Sauce with Pork, along with some
shredded meat, makes a great quick filling.  And I steamed a batch in
my rice cooker/steamer, for 4 hours, although I think they were done
after 3. It was a bit of a pain because when the timer dinged at the
end of an hour, I had to remove the steamer and drip pan and refill
the water base before starting it for another hour, but it was still
less of a hassle than trying to keep them from burning in a big pot.
I also had to clean the base pretty well, as something colored from
the tamales kept working down into the water.  And I think the masa
needs a lot more chili powder to steam it over plain water instead of
flavored water; it was pretty bland after being steamed.
