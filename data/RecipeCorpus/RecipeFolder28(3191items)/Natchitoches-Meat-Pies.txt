1 ts Coarsely ground pepper
1 ts Coarsely ground red pepper
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
1/3 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/2 lb Ground beef
1 1/2 lb Ground pork
1 c  Chopped green onions (tops
-and bottoms)
1 tb Salt
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
3/4 c  Milk
1    Egg; beaten
2 c  Self-rising flour; sifted
1/3 c  Shortening
Combine first seven ingredients in a large Dutch oven; cook over
medium heat until meat is browned.  Sift 1/3 cup flour into Dutch
oven and stir well to combine with meat mixture.  Remove from heat;
let cool slightly. Drain meat mixture in colander; set aside.

Sift flour into a medium bowl; cut in shortening until mixture
resembles coarse crumbs.  Add milk and egg; stir with a fork until
ingredients are moistened.  Shape dough into a ball; divide into 3
parts.

Roll 1/3 of dough out on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch
thickness; cut dough into 5 1/2-inch circles, using a saucer as a
cutting guide. Place dough circles on a lightly greased baking sheet.
Repeat rolling and cutting procedure with remaining dough.

Place a heaping tablespoon of meat filling on one side of each pastry
round.  Moisten edges of rounds with a small amount of water.  Fold
pastry over to cover filling; seal edges using a fork dipped in
water. Prick pastry gently with a fork.  Deep fry in hot oil (350F)
until golden brown. Drain on absorbent paper; serve warm.  Yield:  26
to 28 pies.

NOTE:  Freeze uncooked pies in plastic freezer bags; no need to thaw
before frying.  Also, dough may be cut with a biscuit cutter and
filled with 1 teaspoon filling to make cocktail meat pies.
