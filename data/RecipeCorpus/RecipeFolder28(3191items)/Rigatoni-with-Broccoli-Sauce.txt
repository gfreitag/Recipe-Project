Categories: Pasta, Vegetables
Yield: 5 servings
1    Garlic clove; minced
2 ts Dry breadcrumbs
1/2 c  Olive oil
1 bn Broccoli
1 1/2 tb Salt; for rigatoni
1 lb Rigatoni
1 cn Anchovies in olive oil
Wash and trim broccoli.  Devide into florets and slice stalk into
2-in, finger-sized slices.  Bring large quantity of water to boil.
Add salt, broccoli, and rigatoni at same time. Stir immediately and
cook over high heat about 10 minutes or until pasta is al dente,
stirring occasionally. While this is cooking, heat a small pan. Add
oil, anchovies, and garlic; include the oil the anchovies are packed
in. Stir occasionally. The anchovies will completely dissolve in the
oil, forming a sauce. When anchovies are dissolved, add breadcrumbs.
When pasta is done, remove and drain, but not totally dry. While
still dripping a little, transfer to a warm bowl.  Toss broccoli and
pasta with anchovy sauce. Serve immediately with grated cheese.
