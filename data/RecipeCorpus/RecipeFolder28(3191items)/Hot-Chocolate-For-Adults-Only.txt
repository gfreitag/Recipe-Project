Melt chocolate chips over simmering water or in microwave according to
manufacturer's directions.

Combine milk, half-and-half and sugar in a saucepan and bring up to
simmer (so that bubbles are just beginning to form around the edge of
the pan). Very slowly add about 1 cup of the milk mixture to the
melted chocolate and mix thoroughly. Pour chocolate mixture back into
remaining milk mixture. Stir in rum and liqueur.

Pour into mugs and top with a dollop of whipped cream and a cinnamon
stick. Serve at once.
