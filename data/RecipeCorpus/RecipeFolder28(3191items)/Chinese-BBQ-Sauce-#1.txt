This can be used for chicken wings or pork ribs. Cut wings at joints,
as for buffalo wings. Have butcher cut ribs in half horizontally so
they are about 3" long. Cut rack into pieces of 2 ribs each.

Mix marinade ingredients together.  Marinate chicken wings and/or
pork ribs and refrigerate for 2 hours in plastic bag, turning every
so often.

To cook:  Arrange in foil lined broiler pan, meaty side up.  Brush
with marinade. Cover with heavy duty foil and cook at 325 for 45
minutes. Remove foil, brush with marinade.  Cook uncovered, brushing
with marinade occasionally, until done.  Wings will take about 20
minutes, ribs about 45 minutes.  Do not over cook, the outside will
get too dark and crunchy.
