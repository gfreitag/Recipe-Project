Title: Coniglio alla salvia  (Rabbit with sage)
Categories: Game, Italian
Yield: 4 servings
3 lb Rabbit, dressed, in 8 pieces
Salt
Pepper to taste
Flour for dredging
1 ts Balsamic vinegar
1 c  Dry white wine
4 sl Bacon
3    Garlic cloves, peeled
6    Sage leaves, fresh or
-1 tablespoon dried
2 c  Chicken stock
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
Chop the bacon, garlic and sage very fine, to paste consistancy. (If
using a blender or processor, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of the stock.)
Heat the vegetable oil in a large casserole, meanwhile seasoning the
rabbit parts with salt and pepper and dredging them lightly in flour,
shaking off the excess. Add the rabbit to the casserole and cook over
high heat, turning it until browned, about 3 minutes on per side.

Discard the oil from the casserole. Add the bacon mixture, and return
to the heat, cooking 3 minutes and stirring occasionally. Add the
Balsamic vinegar and white wine, and simmer 5 minutes. Add 1 cup of
the stock, salt and pepper to taste, and cover the casserole. Simmer
until the rabbit is tender, about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally
and adding the remaining stock gradually, as needed, to keep the meat
moist. Transfer the rabbit pieces to a large serving dish and strain
the sauce, which should be thick, over them. If the sauce is thin,
quickly reduce it over high heat.
