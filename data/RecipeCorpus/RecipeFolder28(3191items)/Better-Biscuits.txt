Title: Better Biscuits
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 biscuits
1/4 c  Shortening
3/4 c  Cold milk
2 c  All-purpose flour
3 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
In a large mixing bowl, add the dry ingredients and sift again to mix
thoroughly. Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender until well
combined, but do not overwork the mixture. Even the warmth of your
hands can cause the shortening to melt and make the dough sticky and
heavy.

Add the milk all at once. This is the most important step, because
overworking the dough will create a pasty mixture. Using a large
wooden spoon, try to blend the dough by circling the bowl and cutting
the moist part into the dry mixture. Keep these strokes to a minimum,
about 10 total.

Place the dough onto a cool, floured countertop. Finish mixing the
dough with a light kneading action-very few strokes, just till it
will stay together to form the biscuits. Add more flour as necessary,
to keep it from sticking.

Pat the dough in a circle no less than 1/2" thick and cut the
biscuits with a 2" biscuit cutter. Re-fornm the rest of the dough to
cut more biscuits. Biscuits rise best when they are cut cleanly.

Place the biscuits on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 450
degrees F. for 12 to 15 minutes.

Makes 10 to 12
