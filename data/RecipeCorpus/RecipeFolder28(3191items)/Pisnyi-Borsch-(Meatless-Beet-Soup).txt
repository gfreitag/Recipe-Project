Soak boletus overnight.  Cook in a little water until tender.  Cool,
reserving the liquid, and chop finely.  Scrub the beets and cut into
quarters.  Cover with water and cook over low heat until tender,
about 1 to 2 hours.  Cool and pour off the liquid, reserving it.
Slip off the peels.

(Wear rubber gloves to prevent purple hands.)  This may be done a day
in advance.  Peel and cut up the other vegetables.  Add the bay leaf,
peppercorns, and boletus or mushrooms to the vegetables, with enough
water to cover, and cook, in a large aluminum pot over low heat,
until tender. Strain the beet liquid into the vegetables.  Shred the
beets in a processor or on a medium grater, and add.  Simmer for
about 10 minutes and strain into a large pot.  To keep the broth
clear, do not press the vegetables.

Add the beet kvas, mushroom liquid, pepper and salt.  Bring to a
gentle boil, then turn the heat low.  Taste, the flavor should be
tart, mellow, and full.  For more tartnes, add fresh lemon juice or
sour salt.

Keeps well in the refrigerator.  Reheat gently; do not overcook or
the color will turn brown.

To serve, pour over 3 or 4 vushka (dumplings) in soup plates and
garnish with the fresh dill.
