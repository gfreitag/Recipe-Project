Cut chicken into small bite-sized pieces. Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp
tarragon and salt, if desired. In large, non-stick, spray-coated
skillet, cook chicken pieces over medium heat, turning frequently
with large wooden or plastic spoon, 7 to 10 mins or until they begin
to brown and are cooked through. Remove and set aside in medium bowl.

In skillet in which chicken was cooked, combine oil, onion, celery,
and 3 Tbs broth. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, 6 or 7
mins or until onion is tender. If liquid begins to evaporate, add a
bit more broth.

Add mustard to pan and stir to combine well. Stir in remaining chicken
broth, brown sugar, remaining tarragon, lemon juice, white pepper, and
salt, if desired. Stir in reserved chicken. Cover and simmer 20 mins
or until flavors are well blended. Bring to a boil.

Combine water and cornstarch in a cup. Stir into sauce and cook,
stirring, until thickened. Simmer an additional 2 or 3 mins.

Arrange rice on a large platter. Top with chicken and sauce. Or serve
individual portions of chicken and sauce over rice.
