-lge
2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 bn Spinach, chopped, no stems
1/4 c  Pitted ripe olives, sliced
1 tb Salad oil
2 md Onions, sliced 1/2"
2 ts Flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Rosemary, dry crushed
1/2 ts Black pepper
About 40 minutes before serving: In a 10 inch skillet (non-stick
sauce pan for 1 serving) over medium-high heat, heat the oil then add
onions and cook until soft and golden brown. Remove onions to a bowl
and set aside.

On a sheet of waxed paper, mix the flour, salt, rosemary and pepper,
blending well.  Coat each piece of chicken.  Cook the chicken pieces
over medium high heat in the remaining oil until golden brown on all
sides.

Add the potatoes, lemon juice, cooked onions and 1/4 cup of water to
the chicken in the skillet.  Do not reduce the liquid for one serving
or the pot is likely to boil dry.  Heat to boiling, then reduce heat,
cover and simmer for 20 min or until the chicken and potatoes are
fork tender. The juices of the chicken will run clear when pierced
with a knife.

Stir in the spinach and olives, cooking until the spinach is just
wilted.
