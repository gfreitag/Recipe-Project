Recipe by: Skinny One-Pot Meals - ISBN 0-940625-75-X Preheat oven to
450 F.

In large, non-stick skillet, combine ground round, onion, garlic,
zucchini, red pepper, Italian seasoning, salt, if desired, and black
pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until meat has
browned and onion is tender, about 7 to 8 mins. Remove skillet from
heat. Turn out meat mixture onto large plate lined with paper towels
to absorb excess fat and liquid. Return mixture to pan.

Meanwhile, spread pizza sauce evenly over pizza shell, leaving a
1/4-inch ring of crust at outer edge. Sprinkle evenly with cheese.
Spread meat and vegetable mixture evenly over all. Sprinkle on
olives, if desired. Bake 7 to 9 mins, or according to package
directions, until edges of crust are browned. Cut into wedges.
