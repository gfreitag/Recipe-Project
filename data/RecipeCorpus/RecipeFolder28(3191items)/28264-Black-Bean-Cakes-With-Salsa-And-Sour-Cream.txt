These little cakes are absolutely delicious.  We've enjoyed various
versions in restaurants throughout the southwest and at Jeremiah
Tower's restaurant, Stars in San Francisco.

Rinse the black beans, picking out stones, and soak in water
overnight. Drain beans. Saute onion over medium heat in a heavy
saucepan. Add beans and chicken stock to cover.  Add the chilies and
seasonings. Cook over medium heat for about 1 1/2 hours or until the
beans are tender. Remove from heat and cool.  Place bean mixture in a
food processor and pulse until cool.  This mixture can be
refrigerated for up to 3 days. Place a non-stick pan over medium
heat, or you can brush a saute pan lightly with olive oil. Form bean
mixture into balls the size of a golf ball. Flatten to form patties.
Cook bean cakes on each side for about a minute or until lightly
browned.

Garnish with sour cream and salsa, along with a sprig of fresh
cilantro.

Makes about 24 patties.
