In a Dutch oven, combine onion, garlic, olive oil, and 3 Tbs broth.
Cook, stirring, over medium heat, about 5 to 6 mins or until onion is
tender. If liquid begins to evaporate, add a bit more broth.

Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Adjust rack about 2 inches from heating
element. In a shallow baking pan, sprinkle flour over meat. Stir to
coat. Spread out pieces so they are separated from one another. Broil
about 6 to 7 mins, turning once or twice, until meat is browned on
all sides.

Add remaining broth to Dutch oven, along with sherry and tomato
sauce. Stir to mix well. Stir in browned beef cubes. Add carrots,
celery, green beans, and potatoes. Stir in rosemary, thyme, bay leaf,
sugar, salt, if desired, and pepper.

Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 1 1/2 hours, stirring
occasionally, or until vegetables and meat are tender. Remove bay
leaf. Stir together cornstarch and water. Bring stew to a boil. Add
cornstarch mixture, stirring until gravy thickens slightly. Reduce
heat and cook an additional 2 to 3 mins.
