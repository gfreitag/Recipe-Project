Title: Ghee
Categories: Condiments, Indian
Yield: 2 cups
2 c  Unsalted butter
Heat butter in pan, stirring until melted. When the solids (whey)
appear at the bottom and the clear part (ghee) is at the top, reduce
heat to low. continue to stir over low heat until light brown. Turn
off heat and keep stirring so that it doesn't boil over. Cool
slightly.

Put a cheesecloth over a container or jar and pour the butter through
the cloth so that the ghee strains through into the container.
Squeeze the remaining ghee from the cloth and discard the residue.
Cool, cover and keep until required.
