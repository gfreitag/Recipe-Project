Flatten the breasts using a mallet or other blunt tool. Don't cut the
breast through, however, just hit it hard enough to flatten to about
1/4 to 1/2-inch thick.

In a small saucepan combine the jellied cranberry sauce (chop into
chunks to speed melting), sweet sherry, chicken stock, dry and
prepared mustard, ginger, nutmeg, and Chinese Five-spice, and brown
sugar. Over high heat bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer
for 10 mins.

Melt the butter/margarine in a skillet and saute the chicken breast
until lightly browned and cooked through. Remove from the skillet and
keep warm while you prepare the sauce.

Add the cranberry sauce mixture to the butter/margarine in the
skillet. With the heat on high, reduce the sauce to about half of its
original volume and pour it over the chicken breasts to serve.
