Machine Procedure:  All ingredients must be at room temperature,
unless otherwise noted. Add ingredients, except for filling, crumb
topping, and egg wash, in the order specified in your ABM manual. Set
ABM on dough/manual setting. At the end of program, press clear/stop.
To punch dough down, press start and let knead for 60 secs. Press
clear/stop again. Remove dough and let rest 5 mins before
hand-shaping. If your ABM does not have a dough/manual setting,
follow normal bread making procedure but let dough knead only once.
At the end of the kneading cycle, press clear/stop. Let dough rise
for 60 mins, checking after the first 30 mins. to make sure dough
does not overrise and touch the lid. Press start and let machine run
for 60 secs to punch dough down. Press clear/stop. Remove dough and
let rest 5 mins before hand-shaping. Hand-Shaping Technique: While
the dough is rising, prepare your filling of choice by blending
ingredients together with a fork until crumbly. To make crumb
topping, blend all ingredients together with a fork until crumbly.
Chill both until ready to use. Lightly grease a 4 1/2 x 8 1/2-inch
loaf pan. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a
10- x 20-inch rectangle. Cover with filling up to 1 inch from edges.
Roll up lengthwise, jelly-roll fashion. Pinch seam and ends securely
to gether so they do not open during baking. Carefully place babka in
prepared pan. Fold ends under and shape into an S so that it fits in
pan. Cover with a clean kitchen cloth and let rise until doubled in
size. Preheat oven to 350 F. Form a crease in the top of the risen
babka with the side of your hand. Brush with egg wash and cover with
crumb topping. Bake approximately 30 to 35 mins, or until golden. If
babka begins to brown too quickly, cover top with foil. Remove from
pan and cool on a wire rack.

CHOCOLATE BABKA FILLING: Blend together unsweetened cocoa and sugar.
Brush surface with melted butter. Sprinkle with cocoa-sugar mixture
and pecans.

CHEESE BABKA FILLING: Blend together all the ingredients but raisins.
After spreading the cheese filling on the babka, sprinkle with
raisins.
