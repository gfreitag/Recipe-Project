Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------MIX TOGETHER-----------------------------
Fruit-based jam
1/4 c  Unsweetened applesauce
2 tb Lite preserves or
MMMMM--------------------------BEAT IN-------------------------------
(reconstituted to liquid)
1    Egg replacer equal to 1 egg
MMMMM--------------------------STIR IN-------------------------------
3 tb Soy milk
2 ts White vinegar
2    To 3 mashed very ripe
Bananas
MMMMM-----------------------SIFT TOGETHER----------------------------
1/4 ts Baking soda
1 pn Salt
2 c  Whole wheat flour
2 ts Wheat gluten
1/2 ts Baking powder
Add dry ingredients to the batter, mixing well.  Stir in 1/4 C
raisins or date pieces (found in the bulk bins at some health food
stores).  Fill cupcake size muffin tins 3/4 full.  (Batter is very
thick.)  Bake 30 minutes at 350 degrees, until top is brown and has a
hard crust. Cool slightly, then remove from tins. Makes 12. This is a
great recipe to double or triple, depending on how many ripe bananas
you have.

These freeze beautifully and can be popped in the oven or toaster
oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes to give them that fresh
baked feel, if desired.

I use a nonstick muffin pan but I just picked up some cushionaire
muffin tins and find the breads came out lighter now.  I do NOT spray
the tins with any Pam.
