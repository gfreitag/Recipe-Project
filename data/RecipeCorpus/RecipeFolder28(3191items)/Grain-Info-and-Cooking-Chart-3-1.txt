Forms of Buckwheat
Yield: 1 info

Unroasted Buckwheat

Whole Buckwheat Groats: Pale in color and used for stuffing or pilafs
or in dishes where the taste of roasted buckwheat would be too
assertive.

Creamy Kernel Buckwheat Grits: An almost white cereal, very similar to
CReam of Wheat. Easily digestible and excellent for souffls and
desserts, as well as a perfect cereal for breakfast.

Dark Buckwheat Flour: Ground from the unhulled groat, it is grayish in
color with tiny black specks. Stronger than the light buckwheat flour
because it has about 17% of the finely milled articles of the hulls.
Usually used alone for pancakes or in combination with wheat flour for
baked goods. Since buckwheat is not a true cereal grain, it does not
have gluten.

Light Buckwheat Flour: The outside hull is removed before milling.
Can be used in baked goods, to thicken sauces, and for pancakes.
Contains only 7% of the dark hull particles.

Unprocessed Buckwheat Seeds: Used for sprouting and planting for soil
improvement or to grow as a crop. Available in health food stores
under the Pocono brand.

Roasted Buckwheat

Kasha: Comes in four forms and is generally available in most
supermarkets.

* Fine: Cooks quickly and is less chewy than the other varieties. *
Medium: Good for all-around use. * Coarse: Also good for most
purposes. Coarse ground is kasha that has been cracked in large
particles. * Whole Grain: Uncracked, good for pilafs.

General instructions for all types: Put paper towel between lid and
pot while standing so excess moisture is absorbed. Fork-fluff after
standing.
