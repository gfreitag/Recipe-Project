Categories: Snacks
Yield: 25 pretzels
2 T  Milk
4 dr Raspberry flavor oil
Burgandy paste food coloring
14 oz Chocolate candy coating
10 oz 2 1/2" wide pretzel knots
1 c  Sifted powdered sugar
In a heavy medium saucepan, melt candy coating over low heat, stirring
frequently.  Using a large fork or dipping fork, dip pretzels into
chocolate.  Transfer to a baking sheet covered with waxed paper.
Place in refigerate to allow coating to harden.  For icing, mix
powdered sugar, milk, and raspberry flavored oil  in a small bowl
until smooth. If necessary, icing may be thinned by adding additional
milk, 1 tsp at a time. Divide icing evenly into 2 small bowls.  Tint
one bowl light pink and one bowl dark pink.  Place pretzels on a wire
rack with waxed paper underneath. Drizzle both colors of icing over
pretzels. Allow icing to harden. Store in airtight container.
