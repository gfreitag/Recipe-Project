1. On a piece of wax paper, combine 1/3 cup of flour, 1/4  tsp of
salt, and the pepper. Coat the chicken with this mixture. In a deep,
12-inch nonstick skillet, heat the oil over moderately high heat. Add
the chicken and cook for 4 mins on each side or until browned. Add
the stock and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover, and simmer 15
mins. Transfer to a buttered 13 x 9 x 3-inch baking dish, reserving
the stock.

2. Preheat the oven to 425 F. In a large bowl, whisk the egg and egg
whites. Whisk in the milk, 1 Tbs of the butter, and the remaining 1/4
tsp of salt, then whisk in 1 cup of the flour until smooth. Pour over
the chicken and bake, uncovered, for 15 mins. Reduce the oven
temperature to 350 F and bake 20 mins longer or until the topping is
puffed and golden.

3. Meanwhile, in a medium-size saucepan, heat the remaining 2 Tbs of
butter over moderate heat. Add the remaining 1/3 cup of flour and
cook until bubbly. Whisk in 3 1/2 cups of the reserved cooking liquid
and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 5 mins, stirring
frequently. Stir in the parsley and thyme. Drizzle about 1/2 of the
gravy over the chicken . Serve with the remaining gravy and a green
salad. Makes 4 servings.
