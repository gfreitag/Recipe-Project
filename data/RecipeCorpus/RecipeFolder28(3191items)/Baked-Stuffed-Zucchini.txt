1. Scrub zucchini and cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out and
reserve pulp, leaving shells 1/4-inch thick.
2. Drop shells into boiling water and boil for 5 minutes.
3. Chop pulp and saute in margarine. Add scallion (or green
onions) and mushrooms; saute 3 minutes longer. Add nuts and remove
from heat.
4. Beat eggs with parsley, basil, salt and pepper to taste.
5. Add egg mixture and fresh bread crumbs to pulp mixture. Spoon
into zucchini shells which have been drained. Top with grated cheese.
Use your choice of cheese; Parmesan is only one suggestion.
6. Place into a baking dish which has been greased with
margarine. Add 1/2 inch of water and bake, uncovered, in preheated
350-degree oven for about 30 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes, then serve.
