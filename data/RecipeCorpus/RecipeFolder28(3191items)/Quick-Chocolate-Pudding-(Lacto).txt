Title: Quick Chocolate Pudding (Lacto)
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
3 tb Sugar*
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Nonfat milk
1 tb Cornstarch
1 tb Cocoa
Whisk first four ingredients together in a saucepan (you want to make
sure that the cornstarch is dissolved!). Turn heat to medium. Cook
until mixture is hot, stirring the entire time (don't let it boil).
Turn heat to low and cook until pudding thickens. Remove from heat.
Stir in vanilla. Eat.

This recipe doesn't get as puddinglike as instant, but even if it
totally fails, it makes a great thick hot chocolate. Also, according
to my calculations, it has not much more than 100 calories for AN
ENTIRE CUP. It has never failed to cure my chocolate cravings.

*I start with 2 tablespoons sugar and add more to taste. I forget how
much was in the recipe to start with, but it was too much.

Mennonite cookbook that I have.
