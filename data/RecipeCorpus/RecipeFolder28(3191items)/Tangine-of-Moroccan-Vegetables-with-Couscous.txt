Make the tangine: In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat.
Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about
6 to 8 minutes.  Add the bell pepper, garlic, turmeric, ginger,
cinnamon, salt, cayenne, and saffron, and stir for 1 minute.

Stir in the carrots, squash, tomatoes with their juice, and vegetable
stock, breaking up the tomatoes with the spoon.  Bring to a simmer
over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 to
30 minutes, until the vegetables are just tender.

Stir in the zuchinni, garbanzo beans, and raisins.  Cover and continue
cooking until the squash is tender, about 5 to 10 minutes.

Make the couscous: Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, combine the water,
oil, and salt and bring to a boil over high heat.  Stir in the
couscous. Immediately remove from the heat, cover, and let stand
until the couscous has absorbed all the liquid, about 5 minutes.

Place the couscous on a warmed serving platter and make a well in the
center.  With a slotted spoon, spoon the vegetables into the well.
Pour the tangine cooking juices over the couscous, sprinkle with the
almonds, and serve.
