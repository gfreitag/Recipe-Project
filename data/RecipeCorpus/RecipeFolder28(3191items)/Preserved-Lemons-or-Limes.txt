Title: Preserved Lemons or Limes
Categories: Fruit, Condiments
Yield: 1 batch
Paprika
Vegetable or very light
-olive oil
1/2    -dozen lemons or mixture of
-lemons and limes
Salt
Place lemons (or mix of lemons and limes) in freezing compartment
overnight.  The next day scrub and slice them.  Sprinkle with salt and
leave in a colander to drain and soften.  This can take several hours
or longer depending on the weather.  Arrange the slices in layers in
a glass jar, sprinkling each layer with paprika.  Cover *completely*
with oil. They are ready in about a month when they are soft and a
beautiful warm golden color.  Store in a cool, dry place.

For an alternative method of preserving lemons:  Take as many lemons
or limes as you wish to preserve.  Stud each with 6 cloves.  Pierce
the skins with a skewer to save your thumbs.  Place in a glass jar
and cover completely with oil or white vinegar.  Keep cool.  They
will be ready in 3-4 weeks.

The authors note that pickled lemons and limes are used in the Middle
East, especially North Africa, to add a salty tartness to soups and
stews. The flavor is more in the rind and pith than the flesh.  The
oil can be used for basting grilled fish or in a vinaigrette.  A
suggestion is made to add thinly sliced preserved lemons to a
shredded lettuce, onion and mint salad. The authors also mention that
although they found several recipes for preserving lemons in old
English cookery books they had no idea how to use them so they
provided a recipe for a North African chicken, lemon and olive dish
(separate recipe).
