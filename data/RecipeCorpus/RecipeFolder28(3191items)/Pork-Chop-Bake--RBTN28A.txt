Title: Pork Chop Bake  RBTN28A
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1 ea Onion   sliced
2 c  Cream of mushroom soup
1 c  Water
4 ea PORK CHOPS 1/2 INCH THICK
1 x  FLOUR
1 x  SEASONING, SALT, Pepper etc.
4 ea Potatoes  sliced
Flour, season & brown pork chops in skillet, set aside. Peel and slice
enough potatoes to line roasting pan, filling to desired depth. Slice
an onion over the raw potatoes and salt to taste. Place browned pork
chops on top of potatoes. Pour two cans of cream of mushroom soup and
a can of water over the chops. Bake (maybe 350F) uncovered about 1
hour or until potatoes are done. Length of time depends on the amount
of food as explained below... You can use as few pork chops &
potatoes as you want, or as many as you can cram into the pan. I
generally buy a pork loin or whatever is on sale at my favorite
supermarket. I've even substituted pork steak for pork chops & that
works too. I found that adding a little more wateer makes more gravy
over potatoes.
