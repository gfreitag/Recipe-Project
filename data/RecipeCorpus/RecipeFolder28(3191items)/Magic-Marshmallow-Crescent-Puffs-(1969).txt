Heat oven to 375 degrees.  In small bowl, combine sugar, flour and
cinnamon.  Separate dough into 16 triangles.  Dip 1 marshmallow in
butter; roll in sugar mixture.  Place marshmallow on wide end of
triangle.  Roll up starting at wide end of triangle and rolling to
opposite point. Completely cover marshmallow with dough; firmly pinch
edges to seal.  Dip 1 end in remaining butter; place butter side down
in ungreased large muffin cup of 6 oz custard cup. Repeat with
remaining marshmallows.

Bake at 375 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.
(Place foil or cookie sheet on rack below muffin cups to guard
against spills.)

Immediately remove from muffin cups; cool on wire racks over waxed
paper. In small bowl, blend powdered sugar, vanilla and enough milk
for desired drizzling consistency.  Drizzle over warm rolls. Sprinkle
with nuts.  Edna Holmgren, MN.
