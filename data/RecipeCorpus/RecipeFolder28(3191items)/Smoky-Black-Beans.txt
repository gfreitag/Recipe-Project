3. Remove chipotles from water, trim off tops, and halve chilies
lengthwise. Scrape out seeds and cut chipotles into Â«inch pieces.

tender, but still intact, 3-5 hours. Add water to the pan as needed
if the beans begin to look dry.

pepper. Transfer to plates or a bowl and garnish with scallions and
chilies. Pass hot sauce if desired.
