Title: Live Hummus
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 2 servings
1    To 2 Tbsp. tamari soy sauce
1/4    To 1/2 cup fresh organic
Carrot juice
1    Bag sprouted bean mix (1 3/4
Cup)
2    To 3 lemons juiced
2    To 3 garlic cloves
Put all ingredients in a food processor or blender and blend until
smooth. A blender may need a little more liquid to get a smooth
texture.

My variation: instead of the carrot juice, I grate 2 whole organic
carrots in the food processor first, then add all the other
ingredients and process until smooth.

Great with whole wheat pita pockets.
