~-------------------- Another recipe, submitted by Amy Conrad of
Enid, calls for a few changes in ingredients. Her's calls for 2 eggs,
1/8 teaspoon salt, and an additional 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1 cup
crushed pineapple, drained and 2 baked 9-inch pie crust. Mixing
instructions are the same. ~-------------------- Marie Heinrich's
recipe calls for 1 cup whipped cream instead of the heavy cream and 1
9-inch baked pie crust.
