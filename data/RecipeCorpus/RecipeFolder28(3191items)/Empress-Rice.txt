1 ea Envelope unflavored gelatin
1/4 c  Cold water
1/4 t  Of vanilla
1/2 pt Whipping cream
Raspberry Sauce (See recipe)
1/2 c  Medium/short grain rice
3 c  Water
1/2 t  Salt
2 1/8 c  Hot milk
1/2 c  Sugar
Bring water and salt to a boil in a saucepan and cook the rice 5-6
minutes. Drain it in a strainer and rinse. Combine the hot milk and
drained rice and cook gently 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Milk
should reduce by half). When rice is tender (not before) add sugar
and continue stirring until very tender, stirring now and then.
Meanwhile, sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water and allow to
stand 10 minutes, or until water is absorbed and gelatin is soft.
Stir the softened gelatin into the hot rice mixture and stir until
gelatin granules disappear. Put mixture in a cool bowl and add
vanilla. Place bowl of rice over another bowl filled with ice and
stir frequently until mixture feels thick and heavy like sour cream
or honey. Immediately whip the cream in a cold bowl with cold beaters
until stiff. Fold cream into rice until streaks disappear. SPoon
mixture into an ungreased fluted mold. Rap once on the counter to
remove air pockets. Cover and chill overnight. To unmold, loosen rim
with a knife and dip mold about 30 seconds in bowl of hot water.
Invert on a platter. Repeat process if it doesn't come out on the
first try. Chill, covered (a mixing bowl inverted over it is perfect)
until serving time. Spoon sauce around dessert. You could also chill
rice in a glass bowl. To serve, spoon into individual serving dishes
and top with sauce. SUGGEST USING THE RASPBERRY SAUCE TO TOP WITH.
