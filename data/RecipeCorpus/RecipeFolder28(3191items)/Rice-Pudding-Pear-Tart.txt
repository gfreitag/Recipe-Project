Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 10" tart
1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Butter or margarine
1/4 ts Salt
2    Eggs; beaten
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 tb Sugar
1    Sheet prepared pie crust
2 c  Dry red wine
1 ts Ground cinnamon
2 lg Pears

2 c  Cooked rice
2 c  Half-and-half
Prepare pie crust according to package directions.  Place in 10-inch
tart pan.  Bake at 450 F. for 8 to 10 minutes or until lightly
browned; set aside.  Place wine and cinnamon in 10-inch skillet;
bring to a boil.  Add pears; reduce heat, cover and poach 10 minutes.
Turn pears in liquid and continue to poach 5 to 10 minutes or until
pears are tender.  Remove from wine; set aside.  Combine rice,
half-and-half, sugar, butter and salt in 3-quart saucepan.  Cook over
medium heat 12 to 15 minutes or until slightly thickened.  Gradually
stir one-fourth hot pudding mixture into eggs; return egg mixture to
saucepan, stirring constantly.  Continue to cook 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir in vanilla.  Pour pudding mixture into pre-baked crust. Place
pears, cut-side down, on cutting surface.  Cut thin lengthwise slits
in each pear, one-third down from stem end.  Fan pears over pudding
mixture.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 F.; bake 30 minutes or until
pudding is set.  Remove from oven; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar.
Place tart in oven about 4 to 5 inches from heat source, broil 1 to 2
minutes or until top is browned.  Cool before serving. Tart can be
made ahead, if desired.
