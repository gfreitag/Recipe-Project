Title: Slow Porridge
Categories: Breakfast, Soup/stew, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
1 ds Ground nutmeg
1 ds Ground mace
1 ds Ground cinnamon
5 c  Water
1 c  Oatmeal; * see note
1/2 c  Dried fruit
Recipe by: McDougall Place water, cereal, and dried fruit in slow
cooker. Stir. Cook on low for 8 - 10 hours. The mixture should be
like a thick soup, so do not add milk at the table.

HELPFUL HINTS: Each slow cooker is a little different from the
others, so you may have to adjust the amount of water needed.

For added flavor sprinkle a bit of nutmeg, mace or cinnamon, in any
combination. Try brown rice, barley, rye berries, whole oats, or wheat
berries. Cracked grains, such as oatmeal or cracked wheat, may get too
mushy for some tastes. From the collection of Sue Smith, S.Smith34,
