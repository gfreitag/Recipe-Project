Title: Chocolate Log
Categories: Chocolate, Desserts
Yield: 4 logs
-melted
1 tb Sugar
2 oz Flaked coconut (optional)
1/2    -teacup dark rum (approx.)
2 oz Dried mixed fruit and peel
2 oz Raisins
1/2 lb Walnut pieces
2 oz Blanched, toasted almonds
6 oz Good quality plain chocolate
Put the fruit and nuts through a mincer or food processor, chop them
fairly coarsely and then place in a mixing bowl.  Add the melted
chocolate, the sugar and the optional coconut.  Mix with your hands
or a wooden spoon until well blended.  Add rum to the mixture until
it becomes soft and pliable but not too liquid to hold its shape.

Divide into four equal parts.  Place on a sugared board and shape
into logs with your hands.  Finally, roll each log in granulated
sugar. Wrap tightly in greaseproof paper and then in foil or plastic
wrap. Leave in a cool, dry place to mellow and solidify.  Serve cut
into slices.

To make a Yule Log, score the log to make it look like tree bark. Add
a few hazelnuts for knots and stick in a few sprigs of holly. Wrap in
colored tissue paper and tie the ends with ribbon to look like a
Christmas cracker for giving away.

The authors note that this is *very* rich and that it improves with
age.
