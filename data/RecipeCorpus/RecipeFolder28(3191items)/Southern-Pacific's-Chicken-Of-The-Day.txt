Preparation Time: 1:10

1. On a piece of wax paper, mix the flour and pepper, then use to
coat the chicken. In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat the oil over
moderately high heat. Add the chicken and brown for 4 mins on each
side, then transfer to a platter.

2. In the same skillet, melt the butter. Add the mushrooms, onion, and
garlic and saute for 5 mins or until tender. Add the chicken, wine,
and salt and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover, and simmer,
stirring often, for 30 mins or until the juices run clear when a
thigh is pricked with a fork. Transfer to a warm platter can cover
with foil.

3. Meanwhile, prepare the croutons: In a 10-inch nonstick skillet,
heat the butter and oil over moderately high heat. Add the bread
cubes and garlic powder and stir for 4 mins or until the croutons are
browned. Spoon on top of the chicken and sprinkle with the parsley.
Serve with steamed broccoli spears. Makes 4 servings.
