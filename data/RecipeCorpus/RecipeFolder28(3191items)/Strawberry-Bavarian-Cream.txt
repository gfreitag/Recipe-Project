Title: Strawberry Bavarian Cream
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 3 servings
3 oz Strawberry gelatin
1/2 pt Chilled whipping cream
10 oz Frozen sliced strawberries
1 c  Boiling water
Thaw and drain strawberries; retain syrup.  Dissolve gelatin in
boiling water.  Add cold water to the syrup you retained to make 1
cup; stir into dissolved gelatin.  Chill until almost set.  In
chilled bowl, beat cream until stiff.  Beat gelatin until foamy. Fold
gelatin and strawberries into whipped cream.  Pour into 1 quart mold
or individual molds. Chill until firm.  Unmold.  I usually put
whipped cream on top, sometimes adding kiwi. Randy Rigg
