Preparation Time: 2:10

1. Preheat oven to 350 F; butter a 13 x 9 x 3-inch ovenproof dish.
Using 2 Tbs of butter, thinly coat one side of each bread slice. Cut
each slice into 4 triangles, making 32; line the dish with 16
triangles, buttered-side up.

2. In a medium-size saucepan, melt the remaining 2 Tbs of butter over
moderate heat. Stir in the flour and cook until bubbly. Whisk in the
milk, salt, pepper, and nutmeg; bring to a boil and cook until
thickened. Remove from the heat, cool, then whisk in the egg.

3. Top the bread in the dish with 1/2 of the apples, 1/2 of the
onion, 1/2 of the cheese, and 1/2 of the sauce; repeat. Arrange the
remaining 16 bread triangles , buttered-side-up, around the edge of
the dish, overlapping slightly. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Uncover and bake for 50 mins or until puffy and golden. Let stand for
10 mins; garnish with the apple slices if you wish. Serve with a
spinach salad. Makes 8 servings.
