Title: Passion Fruit Brandywine
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 batch
1 tb Honey
4    -fluid ounces brandy
6    Passion fruit
1    Bottle dry white wine
Squeeze the flesh and pips of the passion fruit into a glass jar with
a lid.  Add the white wine.  Cover, shake and keep cool and dark for
5 days. Then strain the wine into a saucepan.  Add the honey and heat
gently just until the honey is dissolved.  Let it cool, add the
brandy, bottle and cap.

The authors say this can be made year-round with imported passion
fruit and that it can be served, chilled, as an aperitif, with a
splash of sparkling water.
