1    Information
We often prepare a goose for Christmas and have never experiencd any
smoking problem.  Perhaps the roasting temperature was too high or
the fat not drained.

Before the goose goes into the oven, it should have the large pieces
of fat cut off.  Use a rack in the pan to keep the bird out of the
melted fat which should be poured off several times during cooking.
It is also beneficial to prick the lower legs, breast, and side of
the goose to allow for fat drainage during cooking.

When we cook the goose, we start with a 400 degree oven and roast it
breast side up for 20 minutes.  We then turn it over onto the breast,
reduce oven temp to 325 and roast for 1 hour.  Turn the goose onto
it's back and roast for 1 to 1 1/4 hour more. The bird is done when
the juice runs clear after a fork is inserted into the leg.

After the goose is cooked, let it stand in a warm over (with the door
open) for about 15 minutes.

No need to baste a goose.  Also, we save the goose fat and use it for
cooking as it imparts a wonderful flavor. Another "plus" that you get
with a goose is the liver; don't forget to eat that great tasting
part.

Incidently, these times are for a (stuffed) ten pound goose which is
about the size found in the stores. We find that it does not serve
many people though. Also, the meat is generally darker than you would
find on a turkey.

A goose makes a great traditional Christmas dinner.  We use a fruit
and nut stuffing. From: Dennis Mckee Read: Yes
