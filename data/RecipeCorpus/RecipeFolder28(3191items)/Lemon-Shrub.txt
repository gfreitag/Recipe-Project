Title: Lemon Shrub
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 batch
1/2    Bottle dry white wine
2 oz Sugar
1    Bottle Spanish brandy
Peel of 1 lemon
Juice of 2 lemons
Put the brandy, peel and lemon juice in a large glass jar.  Cover and
let it stand for 3 days, then add the wine and sugar.  Cap again,
tightly. Leave for a day or two in a warm place to dissolve the
sugar, then strain through double muslin into clean bottles and seal.

The authors note that Lemon Shrub tastes a little like dry vermouth
and can be drunk with ice and lemon peel or mixed as Pimms with
lemonade or sparkling water.
