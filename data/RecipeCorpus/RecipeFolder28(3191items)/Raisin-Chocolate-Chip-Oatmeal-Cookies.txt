Title: Raisin-Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
2 ts Vanilla
1 ts Salt (I omit)
2 ts Baking soda
4 c  Flour
5 c  Quick oats
2 c  Raisins
1 c  Chocolate or carob chipa
1 c  Chopped nuts (optional)
1 c  Mashed bananas
1 c  Prune puree (or prune
Babyfood)
1 1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Skim milk soured (1 T.lemon
Juice, add milk to 1/2c.)
2 T  Egg replacer + 1/2c. water
Cream bananas, prune mixture, and sugars.  Add egg replacer/water and
beat thoroughly.  Add in vanilla, salt, baking soda, flour, and oats,
beating at medium speed after eaach addition.  Stir in other
ingredients. Spray baking sheets lightly.  Drop heaped soup spoonfuls
onto sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 15-25 min. (depends on
altitude) until slightly brown and slightly crisp on the outside.

NOTE:  I've been making these at 7200 feet altitude.  I cut the
baking soda to 1 1/2 tsp.  You may want to cut the liquids some at
lower altitude.

Adding the soured milk.  I usually beat it in with the egg
replacer/water.

I cut the sugar, replaced half the bananas with prune puree, and added
soured milk to make a softer cooky.  This makes a very large amount.
Use your largest bowl for mixing them.  I usually bake some and
refrigerate the remainder of the dough until the next week.
