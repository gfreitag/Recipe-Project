Title: Wild Plum Cordial
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 batch
MMMMM---------------------PER 12 OZ JAM JAR--------------------------
1 tb Brandy
Vodka to cover
Fruit to fill each jar
1 tb Sugar
1    1-inch piece of vanilla pod
Fill the jar with fruit to just below the neck.  Add the sugar and
vanilla pod.  Pour in the brandy and fill with vodka to cover the
fruit completely. Seal firmly and give the jar a shake to disperse
the sugar. Leave in a warm place for a few days, turning the jar
every day until the sugar is dissolved.  Then keep in a cool, dark
place for at least a month until ready to use.

The authors say that tiny wild red and yellow plums may be gathered in
hedgerows in August (my note:  These authors are from England, I'm
not sure the same applies for the States).  Large domestic cherries
can be substituted to make a Cherry Cordial if plums cannot be found.
They suggest serving the fruit and spirits as a compote or with
creme-fraiche or ice cream and the cordial can be sipped alone.
