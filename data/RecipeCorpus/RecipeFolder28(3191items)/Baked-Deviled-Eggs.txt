Categories: Cheese/eggs, Breakfast
Yield: 20 servings
No Ingredients Found
From: Donna Reynolds in the book "Dining With The Dames" Atherton,
California.  (A very ritzy town.)

I do not know the date of the book.  I think it was around 1978.
There are no "fad" recipes in the book to help me date it. Baked
Deviled Eggs 24 hard-cooked eggs 3/4 cup sour cream 2 1/2 Tablespoon
prepared mustard.(I used one teaspoon powdered mustard) 1/2 stick
butter 1 1/3 cup chopped onions 4 cans cream of mushroom soup 4 cups
sour cream 2 cups Shredded sharp Cheddar cheese First of all I left
the 2 tsp of salt out of the recipe that it called for. There is
plently of salt in the soup. Also I cut the recipe in thirds using 8
eggs and one can of soup and one cup of sour cream it fed eight
people because I had other things on the menu. Split eggs lengthwise.
Mash yolks with sour cream and mustard.  Fill whites. Make a sauce by
sauteing onions in butter until soft remove from hear and add the
mushroom soup and 4 cups of sour cream. Place 1/2 of the mixture in
bottom of a shallow casserole; add eggs in a single layer. Pour
remaing sauce over the top and cover with cheese. Bake at 350 degrees
20 to 25 minutes. Serves 20 and can be assembled the day before.
