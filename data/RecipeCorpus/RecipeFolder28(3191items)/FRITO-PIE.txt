Title: FRITO PIE
Categories: Casseroles, Beef
Yield: 6 servings
16 oz Fritos, small
8 oz Cheddar; shredded
2 cn Chili con carne (Wolf
-Brand)
Heat the chili in a large saucepan; when it's steaming, fold in the
Fritos. Spread in a baking dish, and top with the shredded cheese.
Run under the broiler a few minutes to melt and brown the cheese,
then serve.

Use chili without beans; the Fritos are gonna add enough carbohydrate
and fat as it is.  Besides, the beans and the Fritos don't go good
together.
