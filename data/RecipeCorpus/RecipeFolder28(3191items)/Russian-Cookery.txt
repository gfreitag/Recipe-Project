Our Knowledge of Russian cookery dates from the time before the USSR
came into being, for information available since then has been
limited, and there are no books which can be studied, other than
those of some forty years ago.  It seems likely, however, that the
style of cooking is still the same, but the variety of dishes and the
lavishness with which some of them were prepared have almost
certainly disappeared, and it would seem that this sort of cuisine is
only used for State banquets or receptions. Information tends to come
mainly from Moscow and it is perhaps likely that more of the
traditional recipes are used away from the big towns. In Moscow, beef
would appear to be the meat chiefly eaten, prepared in the manner of
Beef Strogonoff, and this is the main dish in restaurants. Caviare
and eggs are also served, to visitors, and ice cream. Russian cuisine
was rich and varied and characterized by the use of much sour and
fresh cream in the cooking of both meat and sweet dishes. it is
probably to the Russians that we owe the idea of serving small
savoury "canapes" at cocktail parties, for it has always been their
custom to serve these in lavish profusion, arranged on side tables,
before dinner, while vodka is drunk. Origin: Mrs Beeton's Cookery
