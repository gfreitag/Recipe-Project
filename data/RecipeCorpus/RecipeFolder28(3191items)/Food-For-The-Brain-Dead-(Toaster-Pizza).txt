Title: Food For The Brain Dead (Toaster Pizza)
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
x  Toppings of choice
x  Bread
x  Tomato paste
Luckily, I don't have a family to feed, other than the furry critters
who share my abode.  But I often suffer from the Dead Brain Syndrome,
so that's when I get out a loaf of bread, slice off a chunk of it,
and get creative with veggie pizza in the toaster oven.  Slice the
chunk of bread lengthwise, as if you were going to make a sandwich
out of it, toast it for a few minutes, then spread some tomato paste
or sauce on it. Top it with your favorite veg-pizza toppings and
stick it back into the toaster oven for about 5 minutes, or however
long it takes to bake or broil the toppings. You can get as creative
as you like with this.
