Put the eggs, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper in
bowl and mix until the mayonnaise is desolved into the egg. Put in a
pitcher or bottle for easy pouring. Put a non-stick pan treated with
Pam or a little dab of butter or a little bit of vegetable oil on
medium heat. Pour enough egg mix into the pan to cover the bottom of
the pan. When the egg mix is just about firm, put a selection of one
or more of the fillings on one side of the egg. Fold the omlete over
and cook for about a minute before serving. Notes: The number of
fillings is limited only by your imagination and supples. When I was
served this type omlete at the Pennsylvania Governor's mansion, there
were 25 different fillings. This is a great way to serve custom made
omletes to a large group. The egg mixture will be firm so that it
folds and can be served from the pan without breaking up.
