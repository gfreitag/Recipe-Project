Preparation Time: 0:41 1. In a 1-qt glass bowl, combine 10 oz
chocolate and cream. Heat in microwave on High 1 1/2 to 2 mins, or
until mixture is melted and smooth when stirred. Stir in butter until
smooth and melted. Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours or
overnight.

2. Using a 1 1/4-inch ice cream scoop or a tablespoon, scrape up
mixture into 20 balls, about 1 1/2 inches each. Place truffles on wax
paper-lined baking pans and freeze until firm, 1 hour or longer.

3. In a small glass dish, place remaining 12 to 14 oz cut-up
chocolate. Heat in microwave on Medium 3 to4 mins, stirring often,
until chocolate is melted, smooth, and warm. Using a fork, dip
truffles quickly, one at a time, into chocolate, tapping fork on edge
of dish to shake off excess. Place on wax paper-lined baking sheet.
Repeat dipping process, stirring chocolate often and scraping down
sides of dish, if necessary, to prevent chocolate from hardening.
Refrigerate truffles until chocolate is set, 30 to 40 mins. Wrap in
an airtight container and store in refrigerator 2 weeks or in freezer
1 month. Serve in paper candy cups.

NOTE: Truffles can also be rolled in finely chopped nuts or sifted
unsweetened cocoa powder instead of dipped in chocolate. Roll in nuts
or cocoa immediately after shaping into balls. Store as directed
above.
