Title: General Tso's Chicken (real thing)
Categories: Chicken
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Cornstarch
1/4 c  White vinegar
1 c  Salad oil
1/4 c  Cooking sherry
2 c  Sliced green onions
1 1/2 c  Hot chicken broth
16 sm Hot dried peppers
1 tb Msg; (optional)
3/4 c  Refined sugar
1/2 c  Cornstarch
3 lb Chicken*
1/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Dark soy sauce
1 1/2 ts Minced ginger
1 ts White pepper
1 1/2 ts Minced garlic
1    Egg
1/2 c  Dark soy sauce
*Dark deboned in chunks

I divided recipe portions (above) to make it easier to pre-prepare.

To make Sauce, mix cornstarch and water together. Add garlic, ginger,
sugar, soy sauce, vinegar and wine.  Then add broth and MSG and stir
'til sugar dissolves.  Refrigerate 'til needed.

In separate bowl mix chicken, soy sauce and pepper. Stir in egg. Add
cornstarch until chicken is coated evenly. Add oil to help separate
chicken pieces. Divide chicken in small quantities and deep-fry @ 350
until crispy and light brown. (Do not overcook; watch temp, stir fry
or meat will toughen). Drain on paper towels. Place a small amount of
oil in wok and heat 'til just hot. Add onions and peppers and
stir-fry briefly (peppers will give off acrid smoke..be careful).
Stir sauce; add to wok. Add chicken and cook just 'til sauce
thickens.  Add water or water/cornstarch if needed.  This amount will
fill two large platters and serves 8.

Serve with white steamed rice.
