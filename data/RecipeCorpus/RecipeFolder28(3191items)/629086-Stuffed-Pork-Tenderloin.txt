Title: 629086 Stuffed Pork Tenderloin
Categories: Pork
Yield: 6 servings
2 T  Butter
1/2 c  Beef bouillon
1 c  Heavy cream
12    Prunes, pitted
2    Pork tenderloins (about 1
-lb. each)
2 lg Apples, peeled & chopped
-Salt & pepper to taste
Preparation : Split tenderloins the long way, cutting two-thirds of
the way through.  Open flat and pound to an even thickness.  Place
apples on meat and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Lay 6 prunes
across the short end of each tenderloin and roll like a jelly roll.
Tie securely, then brown on all sides in butter.  Add bouillon and
heavy cream. Cover and simmer for 1 hour, taking care to stir
occasionally so meat won't stick. Add water if necessary.  Remove
meat to a hot platter, skim fat from sauce, and scrape sides and
bottom of pan so that none of the delicious brownings will be lost.
Whirl smooth in a blender or press through a fine sieve. Reheat and
pour over meat.  Makes 6 servings.  Another excellent way of using
pork tenderloin is to cut it in slices.  Pound thin, then cook in
butter with salt and pepper.  Serve with either cooked onion or
mushrooms on top. Place water in pan, heat to boiling and pour juices
over meat. Delicious! Submitted By BARRY WEINSTEIN   On   02-25-95
