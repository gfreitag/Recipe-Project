Whole Oat Groats: The untreated, natural, hulled oats, with only the
outermost inedible chaff or hull removed. Can be cooked whole or can
be ground. Since they are the entire grain, they take the longest to
cook.

Steel-Cut Oats: Natural, unrefined oat groats that have been cut into
two or three small pieces for tasty, chewy cereal. They require a
fairly long cooking time, but if they're oven-toasted first, the
cooking is shortened considerably. Cooked steel-cut oats can also be
blended with various flours for baking.

To toast one pound of steel-cut oats: Preheat the oven to 350F. Whirl
the oats in the bowl of a food processor for a few seconds just to
break down the grain a bit. Spread the oats evenly in a 9x13x2-inch
baking dish and toast for twenty minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool
and store in an airtight container.

Rolled Oats: Large, separate flakes that have first been steamed and
then flattened. Usually used in cereals, cookies, cakes, breads and
toppings for fruit crisps. The "quick" or "instant" rolled oats are
processed even further and then heat-treated for faster cooking; thus
they have less nutritional value.

Oat Flour: Finely ground from whole oat groats, with much of the bran
remaining. The flour is almost as nutritious as the groat itself, and
it can be blended with other flours in bread baking. It has no
gluten, so it will not rise unless it's mixed with a gluten-rich
flour such as unbleached white. The addition of oat flour to
home-baked products will help them to remain fresher for longer time,
since the grain has a strong, natural antioxidant. Oat flour is
excellent in baked goods, and can also be used as a thickening agent
in sauces, soups and stews. Available at health food stores.
