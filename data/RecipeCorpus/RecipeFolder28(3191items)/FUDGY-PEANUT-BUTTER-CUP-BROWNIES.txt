Make the brownies:

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees
F.

Line a 13-by-9-inch baking pan with aluminum foil so that the foil
extends 2 inches beyond the two long sides of the pan. Lightly butter
the bottom and sides of the foil-lined pan.

Melt the butter and chocolate according to the melting instructions
in the Chocolate Key. Cool until tepid. In a medium bowl, using a
wire whisk, beat the eggs until foamy. Add the sugar and beat until
blended. Add the cooled chocolate mixture and mix until smooth. Stir
in the vanilla. Stir in the flour and salt until well combined.

Scrape half the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a
rubber spatula. Arrange the peanut butter cups evenly over the
batter, in four rows of six cups each. Press down lightly on each
cup. Pour the remaining batter into the pan, and carefully spread
level over the peanut butter cups. Bake the brownies for 25 to 30
minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a
few moist crumbs clinging to it.

Cool the brownies completely in the pan set on a wire rack. Using the
two ends of the foil as handles, lift the brownies out of the pan.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least four hours or
overnight.

Make the milk chocolate sauce:

Do not make the sauce until the brownies have chilled. Place the milk
chocolate in a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade.
Process for 10 to 20 seconds, until finely chopped. Transfer the
chocolate to a medium bowl. Pour the boiling water over the
chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30 seconds, to melt the
chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth. Stir in the vanilla.

Remove the plastic wrap from the brownies and invert onto a cutting
board or large plate. Carefully peel off the foil. Reinvert the
brownies onto a smooth surface and cut evenly into 24 squares, so
that each brownie has one peanut butter cup in its center. To serve,
place one brownie on each dessert plate, top with some of the milk
chocolate sauce, and sprinkle with some of the chopped peanuts.
