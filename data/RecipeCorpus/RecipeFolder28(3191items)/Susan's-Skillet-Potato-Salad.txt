left, for supper guests. This salad is especially attractive when
arranged, skillet and all, on large wooden board, with slices of cold
roast or ready-to-serve meats such as Bologna, Braunschweiger, or
liverwurst around it With her salad Susan serves coffee and basket of
crisp hot breads 2. First, Susan scrubs 2 lb. potatoes under running
water; then, she cooks them in 1" boiling salted water ( 1/> teasp.
salt per cup water) until just tender- 30 to 35 min. Meanwhile, she
washes and dries 2 stalks celery, 1 head romaine, 6 radishes. 3.
Next, Susan places 6 overlapping slices of bacon. just as they come
from package, in cold 10" skillet. and fries them over low heat until
crisp, separating slices and pouring off bacon drippings into
measuring cup as bacon cooks. Then she removes skillet from heat,
lifts out bacon, and drains it on double thickness of paper toweling.
4. She returns 1/4 cup bacon drippings to skillet; adds tablesp.
flour and 1 cup water, stirring until smooth; then adds 1/3 cup
vinegar, 1 3/4 teasp. salt, 1/8 teasp. pepper, 1 tablesp. sugar. She
cooks sauce over low heat, stirring until thickened; then removes it
from heat. She slices 1 cucumber, 2 celery stalks (1 cup), slantwise;
then 2 onions, paper-thin. 5. Susan next breaks romaine into
bite-size pieces and crumbles bacon. By now, it's time to test
potatoes with two-pronged fork. When potatoes are just tender, she
drains off water and peels them with small paring knife, holding each
potato in clean potholder. (If potato is held on fork, it may split.)
Susan then slices peeled potatoes into medium bowl. 6. To arrange her
salad, Susan puts skillet back over low heat; adds layer potato, then
1 each celery, romaine, cucumber or beans or peas, and onion,
repeating until all are used. With spatula, she tosses salad, taking
care not to break potato slices. To complete this luscious salad, she
sprinkles sliced radishes and crisp bacon bits over top.
