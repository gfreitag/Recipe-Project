1. Heat the oven to 425 F. In a shallow baking dish, combine the
butter, onion, garlic, thyme, salt, pepper, rosemary, sage, marjoram,
and red pepper sauce. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Tuck the
edges of each breast under, forming a rectangular shape about 1 1/2
inches thick.

2. Bake, uncovered, basting frequently with the pan juices, for 14
mins or just until the juices run clear when the chicken is pricked
with a fork. Transfer to a warm serving platter, spoon over the pan
juices, and sprinkle with the parsley. Serve with wild rice. Makes 4
servings.
