Title: Zeytinyagli Pirasa (Braised Leeks with Rice)
Categories: Middle east, Turkish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Sugar
1 1/2 c  Water
3 tb Rice; long/medium, uncooked
2    Lemon; cut lengthwise into
;6 or 8 wedges each
2 lb Leeks; fresh, firm, each
;about 1 Â« inches in
;diameter
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 c  Onion; finely chopped
1 ts Flour
With a sharp knife, cut the roots from the leeks.  Strip away any
withered leaves and cut off and discard all but about 2 inches of the
green tops.  Then wash the leeks under cold running water, spreading
the leaves apart to rid them of sand.  Slice the leeks crosswise into
1 inch lengths, and set aside.
In a heavy 3 to 4 quart casserole, heat the oil over moderate heat
until a light haze forms above it.  Add the onions and, stirring
frequently, cook for 5 minutes, or until they are limp and
transparent but not brown. Stir in the flour, salt and sugar, cook
for a minute or so, then add the water and raise to a boil and
thickens lightly.
Add the rice and the leeks, turning them about with the spoon to
coat them evenly with the sauce.  Reduce the heat to low, cover
tightly and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the leeks and rice are
tender but still intact.  Taste for seasoning.  Cool to room
temperature and serve directly form the casserole, accompanied by the
lemon wedges.
