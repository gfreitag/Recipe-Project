MMMMM-----------------------FRUIT AND NUTS----------------------------
1/2 c  Raisins
1 1/2 c  Almonds
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1/2 t  Baking soda
1/2 t  Salt
1 3/4 c  Rolled oats
3/4 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
3/4 c  Unbleached white flour
1 t  Cinnamon

MMMMM----------------------WET INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1    Egg
1 t  Vanilla extract
1/2 t  Almond extract
2/3 c  Fruit sweetener
1/3 c  Raisin water
1/2 c  Oil
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line baking sheets with baking paper.
Toast the almonds in the oven for 7-10 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool, then process in a food
processor, using the pulsing action, until they are medium chopped.
Bring 1 cup of water to a boil and add the raisins. When the water
returns to the boil, turn off the heat. Let the raisins plump in the
water for at least 10 minutes. Drain the raisins, saving the raisin
water. Sift the flours, spices, baking soda and salt into a large
mixing bowl. Stir in the rolled oats. Whisk the wet ingredients
together until thickened. Stir the wet mixture into the dry
ingredients, mixing until well combined. Then stir in the chopped
almonds and raisins. Using a #24 (2 tablespoon) scoop or a spoon,
place the balls 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake
until golden brown, approximately 10-12 minutes. Let the cookies cool
on the pans before removing. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   03-11-95
