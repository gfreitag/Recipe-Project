In a dry pan, toast the coriander seeds until very aromatic. Add the
chilli flakes and cook briefly, then grind to a fine powder. Season
the meat with ginger, and brown in the ghee or butter with the
cloves. Sprinkle on the coriander and chilli. Add the yoghurt, the
meat, nutmeg and cardamom to the pan and cook for 8 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Add the water, cover the pan and simmer for about 50
minutes until the meat is very tender. Uncover halfway through
cooking to reduce the sauce is a drier curry is preferred. Add the
garam masala. Stir saffron into the cream and add to the pan. Cook
gently, stirring for 3-4 minutes. Serve over white rice and garnish
with the toasted almond flakes.
