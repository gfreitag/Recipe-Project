Title: Easter Mints Kids Can Make
Categories: Question?, Kids
Yield: 1 servings
-confectioner sugar
Large bowl
Wooden spoon
Paper plates
Pencils
1/3 c  Soft butter
1/3 c  Light corn syrup
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Flavoring
3 1/2 c  ( 1 lb ) sifted
This is a no-cook recipe the children can mix with their hands.
Flavor it with any of the liquid flavorings in the supermarket, such
as strawberry and lemon. If you want, you can instead divide it into
three portions and add a few drops of food coloring to tint it
yellow, red, and green. The knead a small amount of flavoring into
each one. This recipe makes about 1 1/2 lbs of candy.

Help the children measure all the ingredients into the large bowl.
They can take turns stirring it with the wooden spoon until it
becomes too stiff. Then they can knead it with their hands. They
should continue kneading until the dough is smooth.

Give each child a paper plate and a pencil. Tell them to turn their
plates OVER and write their names on the Bottom to prevent pencil
lead from getting on their mints. Help them hold their pencils
correctly. Make sure they use upper and lower case letters.

Give each child a portion of dough on his or her plate. The children
can pinch off pieces, roll them into balls, and press them lightly
with a fork to make a fancy butter mint. Children who cannot roll the
candy into balls can make snakes, cut the snakes into pieces, and
press the pieces with a fork. They might eat the pieces with the
fork, but that's ok too.

Leave the mints on the plates and refrigerate them for 30 minutes,
until they become firm. Easter Mints taste even better the second
day, if you can keep everyone from eating them all on the first day.
Cover with plastic wrap and keep them in the refrigerator. Re-Posted
