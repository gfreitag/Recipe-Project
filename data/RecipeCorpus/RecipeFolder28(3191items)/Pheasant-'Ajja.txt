6 corn or olive oil 40 g/1 1/2 oz pine nuts, optional 3 tbsp 40 g/1
3 tbsp 8-10 eggs
1/2 oz sultanas (golden raisins), optional
8-10 450-700 g/1 - 1 1/2 lb cold meat from a cooked pheasant 1 - 1
1/2 lb good bunch of parsley or coriander leaves (cilantro) 7 1/2-10
ml/1 1/2-2 tsp ground cinnamon 1 1/2-2 tsp fine sea salt and freshly
ground black pepper Chop the shallots finely and cook in a little oil
until translucent. Add the pine nuts and sultanas, if used, and cook
for a few minutes. Beat the eggs lightly in a large bowl. Add the
fried mixture, the pheasant meat cut into small pieces, the chopped
herbs, and cinnamon, salt and pepper to taste and stir. In a large
heavy frying pan, heat some oil. Pour in the egg mixture, cover with
the lid of the pan or with a plate and cook on a low heat for 15
minutes. Turn the 'ajja and cook on the other side for 10 minutes
more- the contents of the pan must be firm and solid. To turn, invert
the 'ajja on to another plate and slide back into the pan. Give extra
cooking time if necessary- the surfaces must be well browned.
