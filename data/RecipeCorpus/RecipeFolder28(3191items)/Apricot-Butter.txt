To Make Apricot Puree: Place apricots, a few at a time, in your
blender or food processor and process into a smooth puree. Add 2 Tbsp
lemon juice to keep the puree from darkening. If time is short, you
can put the puree in the freezer in air-tight containers and make the
apricot butter later. Three pounds of apricots should make 1 qt. of
puree.

To Make Apricot Butter: Use 1 qt of apricot puree and mix it with the
sugar and remaining 2 Tbsp lemon juice, cinnamon and allspice in a
large pan. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until thickened. It
is necessary to stir the mixture just about constantly as it will
stick to the bottom of the pan and burn if you don't. The length of
time it takes to thicken will depend partly on how juicy the fruit
was but it will take no less than 20 mins and probably no more than
about 45 mins. To judge thickness, spoon a small amount onto a cold
dish and see if it sets up to your satisfaction (personal preference
enters into this too.....some people like it thicker than others.)

When apricot butter is ready immediately pour it into the hot jars,
place lids on top and tighten rings around. Process for 5 mins in a
boiling water bath.

This recipe can be doubled or even tripled to make a large batch.

(Author's Note): The butter will thicken even more after it is placed
in the jars.
