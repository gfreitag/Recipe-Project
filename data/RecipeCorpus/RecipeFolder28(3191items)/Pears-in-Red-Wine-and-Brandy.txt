Rosendale Road London SE21 8LG METRIC/IMPERIAL U.S. 4 firm pears 4
1/2 cup 90 ml/6 tbsp
100 g/4 oz brown sugar
red wine 6 tbsp a little water 4 cloves 4 2.5 ml/1/2 tsp ground
cinnamon 1/2 tsp 30 ml/2 tbsp brandy 2 tbsp Normally served as a
dessert, we like these pears as an accompaniment to game. We usually
make them 2-3 days before needed because the flavour improves with
keeping. Peel the pears, but leave on the stalks. Put the pears,
sugar, wine and a little water and spices into a heavy saucepan and
bring to the boil. Turn the heat down, cover and simmer gently for
20-25 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, turn the pears frequently so
they will colour evenly. Add the brandy and continue to simmer until
the pears are tender (a further 30-40 minutes). Lift the pears out of
the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside. Reduce the liquid a
little, then strain the liquid over the pears.
