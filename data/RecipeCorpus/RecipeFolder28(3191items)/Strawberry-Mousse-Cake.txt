CAKE:  Butter and flour the bottom and sides of a 9 inch spring form
pan; set aside.  In a large bowl beat whites and cream of tartar to
soft peaks. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup of the sugar, continuing to
beat to stiff peaks. In a separate bowl beat the yolks with remaining
sugar until light yellow and thickened.  Scrape yolks over whites,
add lemon rind and vanilla and fold together.  Sift flour and salt
over batter, folding in gently but thoroughly.  Transfer to prepared
pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until the top springs
back when lightly touched. Let cool in pan on wire rack.  If making
ahead, remove from pan and wrap well for storage at cool room
temperature for one to two days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.

MOUSSE:  In a very small saucepan sprinkle gelatin over water; set
aside. Rinse, hull and puree berries. In a small saucepan combine
puree, sugar and lemon juice and heat gently just long enough to
dissolve sugar. Remove from heat. Warm softened gelatin over low heat
until clear and syrupy. Stir into strawberry mixture.  Transfer to a
large bowl and chill to consistency of raw egg white.  Whisk in the
yogurt. Whip cream until form; fold into mousse and return to fridge.

SYRUP: In a small saucepan bring water and sugar to a boil. Remove
from heat, cool and stir in liqueur.

ASSEMBLY: Using a long serrated knife, but cake into 2 thin layers.
Place top half, but side up, in the botton of a clean 9 inch spring
for pan. Drizzle half the syrup ivenly over the cut side of each of
the 2 halves. Spoon strawberry mousse over cake in pan; don't worry
if mousse extends over the sides.  Set remaining layer, cut side over
mousse, pressing gently. Cover and chill thoroughly, overnight if
possible. Release sides of pan, and using a wide lifter, transfer
cake to service plate, doily-lined if you've thought that for ahead.

CREAM FROSING AND GARNISH: Rinse and hull berries. Slice thinly. Whip
cream until it's stiff and firm. Sweeten with sugar and spread ivenly
over top and sides of cake. Arrange berry slices in circle around the
top and bottom edges of the cake. Refrigerate until serving time,
which should be within the following hour or two.
