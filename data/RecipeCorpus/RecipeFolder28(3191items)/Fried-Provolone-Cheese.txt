Title: Fried Provolone Cheese
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
Grated hard cheese optional
1    Provolone cheese slice
Spices as desired
In a non stick frying pan, fry sliced provolone cheese over medium
high heat.  You can add spices such as oregano, basil, chopped
garlic.  You can add grated parmesan or romano cheese to soak up some
of the excess oil from the provolone.  Watch carefully.  When first
side is golden brown, turn once and cook until it is a nice brown and
crispy on both sides. Makes a good vegetarian bacon for BLT sandwich
or other purpose.
