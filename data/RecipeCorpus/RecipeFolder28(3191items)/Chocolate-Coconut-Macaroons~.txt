Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler or in a micowave
oven. Set aside and cool to room temperature. Place egg whites and
cream of tartar in a mixer bowl and beat at high speed, using a whip,
until peaks are formed.  Add sugar gradually while continuing to beat
at high speed. Add flavorings and salt to meringue, beating at low
speed. Add melted chocolate, continuing to beat at slow speed. Remove
the whip and stir the coconut into the meringue with a spoon. Drop by
heaping tablespoon onto a cookie sheet that has been sprayed with pan
spray or lined with aluminum foil.  Bake at 325 for about 20 minutes,
or until marcroons are not quite firm.  Remove.  Keep in a loosely
covered container in a dry place at room temperature, or freeze until
needed.  Do not cover tightly if storing at room temperature.
