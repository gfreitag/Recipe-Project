:
many versions of this delicious Iranian dish, and it can be made with
wild duck, domestic duck or chicken. If you cannot buy fresh
pomegranates to squeeze for the juice, you can use canned or bottled
pomegranate juice or syrup, which is sold in Middle Eastern food
shops. Do not use grenadine syrup: it is much too sweet. An
alternative to pomegranate juice, that gives a sharper taste, is to
use the juice of two lemons. Cut the mallards into serving pieces and
brown gently in 30 ml/2 tbsp of oil in a flameproof casserole or
heavy saucepan. Remove and reserve. Add the remaining oil and the
chopped onion and saute until translucent. Add the finely chopped
walnuts, pomegranate juice, chicken stock, tomato paste, cinnamon,
sugar and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to the boil, stirring well.
Return the ducks to the casserole making sure that the pieces are
well covered by the sauce. Cover the pan and simmer for 50 minutes to
1 1/4 hours or until the ducks are very tender. Taste the sauce and
adjust the seasoning: if too sweet, add lemon juice; if too tart, add
a little sugar. Skim off excess fat. Place the ducks on a hot serving
dish. Spoon over the sauce. Sprinkle on the coarsely chopped walnuts
and any spare pomegranate seeds. Serve with Timman, page 115.
