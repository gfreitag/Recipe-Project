Make a pastry by sifting together the dry ingredients, cutting in the
butter, and working it together with the cream cheese.  Roll out 2/3
of the pastry and line a 9" pie dish.  Roll out the remaining pastry
and make a circle large enough to cover the dish.  Put away but do
not chill this top layer. Shred a small head of cabbage coarsely.
Wash the mushrooms and slice them. Peel and chop the onion. In a
large skillet, melt 2 tblsp butter and saute the onions and cabbage
for several minutes stirring constantly. Add the majoram, tarragon,
salt, pepper and basil. Stirring often, allow the mixture to cook
until the cabbage is wilted and the onions soft. Remove from pan and
set aside.  Add another tblsp butter to the pan and saute the
mushrooms for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring constantly. Spread the
softened cream cheese in the bottom of the pie shell.  Slice the eggs
and arrange the slices over the cream cheese.  Sprinkle a little dill
on them and cover with the cabbage/onion mixture.  Make a final layer
with the sauteed mushrooms and cover with the remaining circle of
pastry. Press the pastry together tightly at the edges and flute
them.  With a sharp knife, cut a few slashes through the top crust.
Bake in a 400 F degree oven for 15 minutes, then turn temperature
down to 350 F and bake for another 20 to 25 minutes or until the
crust is a light brown. This recipe serves 4 to 6 people.  Enjoy, and
