Make the sorbet base:
In a large saucepan, combine the water and sugar. Cook over medium
heat,
stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves . Bring the
syrup to a
boil; remove the pan from the heat and cool completely. Transfer
the
syrup to a bowl, cover and refrigerate until well chilled, 2 to 3
hours.

Make the lemon sorbet layer:
In a medium bowl combine the lemon juice with the 2 cups of
chilled
sorbet base. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze
according to the manufacturer's directions. Scrape the lemon
sorbet into
a rectangular plastic container that measures 7 1/2-by-11
1/2-inches
(and about 3 inches in height). Using a small metal cake spatula,
smooth
the sorbet into the bottom of the container in an even layer.
Cover the
container and freeze the sorbet for 3 hours, until well frozen.

Make the raspberry sorbet layer:
Pass the raspberry puree through a fine sieve into a medium bowl.
Add
the 2 cups of chilled sorbet base and the lemon juice and whisk to
combine. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze
according
to the manufacturer's directions. Remove the plastic container
with the
lemon sorbet layer from the freezer. Scrape the raspberry sorbet
over
the lemon sorbet layer. Using the cake spatula, smooth the sorbet
into
an even layer. Cover the container and freeze the sorbet for 3
hours,
until well frozen.

Make the passion fruit sorbet layer:
Cut each of the passion fruits in half. Scoop the orange seeded
center
of the halves into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the
metal
blade. Process the fruit for 30 seconds. Pass the puree through a
sieve
into a medium bowl. Add the 2 cups of chilled sorbet base and the
lemon
juice and whisk to combine. Pour the mixture into an ice cream
maker and
freeze according to the manufacturer's directions. Remove the
plastic
container with the 2 sorbet layers from the freezer. Scrape the
passion
fruit sorbet over the raspberry sorbet layer. Using the cake
spatula,
smooth the sorbet into an even layer. Cover the container and
freeze the
sorbet for 3 hours, until well frozen.

Make the lavender syrup:
In a medium saucepan, combine the water and sugar. Cook over
medium
heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Add the
lavender. Bring the syrup to a boil; reduce the heat to low and
cook the
syrup for 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the
syrup
to cool completely.  Pour the syrup through a fine sieve into a
glass
measuring cup or bowl. Cover the container and refrigerate until
chilled
about 1 hour.

Assemble the dessert:
Place 6 dessert plates in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill.
Remove
the sorbet from the freezer. With a paring knife, divide the
sorbet into
6 even blocks, cutting through the three layers. Carefully remove
one
block to a cutting board. Using a 2 3/4 inch six-sided cutter (a 2
3/4-inch round cutter can be used instead), cut out a shaped
block of
sorbet removing the excess sorbet front the edges outside the
cutter.
Place the sorbet shape in the center of a chilled dessert plate.
Repeat
with the remaining blocks of sorbet. Scatter l/2 cup of the
assorted
berries and a few slices of kiwi around each sorbet shape and
pour 1/4
cup of the lavender syrup over the berries. Serve immediately.
