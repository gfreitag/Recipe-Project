Preheat the oven to 350F.  Mix the mustard, oil, dill and brown sugar
in a small bowl.  (Sauce can be prepared up to 2 hours ahead. Cover
and let stand at room temperature.) Place the potatoes in a small
bowl. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the sauce over the potatoes and toss to
coat. Arrange the potatoes in a baking pan and bake for 15 minutes.
Remove the pan from the oven and posh the potatoes to the sides of
the pan. Place the slamon fillets in the center of the pan and spread
each with 2 teaspoons of the sauce.  Bake for about 18 minutes, until
the salmon is cooked through. Meanwhile, place the greens in a large
skillet and toss with 2 tablespoons of the sauce.  Stir over
medium-high heat for about 4 minutes or until the greens are wilted.
Divide the salmon, potatoes and greens evenly between two plates.
Serve immediately, passing the remaining sauce separately. Makes 2
servings. [Taking It Easy; Karen Kaplan & Kristi Kidd] [Bon Appetit;
