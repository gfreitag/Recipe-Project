Yield: 1 servings  First, use care and get one not too young, but tender and a healthy
growth. Make your selection carefully and let it be final, otherwise
they will not keep.  Do not pickle or put in hot water, this makes
them sour. Like wine they sweeten with age.  Prepare as follows:
Sweeten with smiles according to variety.  The sour bitter kind are
improved by a pinch of common sense. Spice with patience.  Wrap well
in a mantle of charity. Preserve over a good fire of steady devotion.
Serve with peaches and cream.

NOTE:  The poorest varieties may be improved by this process and keep
for years in any climate.
