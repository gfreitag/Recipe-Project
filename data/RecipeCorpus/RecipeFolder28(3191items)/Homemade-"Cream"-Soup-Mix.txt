Combine all ingredients, mixing well. Store in an airtight container
until ready to use.

TO SUBSTITUTE FOR 1 CAN OF CONDENSED SOUP: Combine 1/3 cup of dry mix
with 1 1/4 cups of cold water in a saucepan. Cook and stir until
thickened. Add to casserole as you would the canned product.

Makes the equivalent of 9 cans of soup.

(Author's Note): Use in casseroles or as a base for homemade soups.
Lower fat and salt than canned products. Try one batch then make
plenty so you will always have it on hand.
