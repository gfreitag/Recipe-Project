Title: * My Rice Pudding *****
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
1/3 c  Sugar
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1 tb Butter
1    Egg yolk
2/3 c  Minute rice
3 1/3 c  Milk
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
Directions Put all ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
Cook over medium heat for 30 minutes, stirring about every 10
minutes. Remove from heat. Beat egg yolk slightly and add a small
amount of the hot rice to beaten egg and stir well. Return to
saucepan and heat to boiling. Remove from heat. Cool. Serve hot or
cold.

Note; You may add raisins at the start. Also very nice with ice
cream. As my granddaughter and I are the only ones who like rice
pudding I don't make this very often but it is delicious.
