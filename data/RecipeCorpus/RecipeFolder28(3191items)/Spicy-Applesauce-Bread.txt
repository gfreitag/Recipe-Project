Title: Spicy Applesauce Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 servings
1/8 ts Cloves; ground
1/2 c  Butter or regular margarine
1 c  Sugar
1 lg Egg
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Walnuts; chopped
1 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Water
1 c  Applesauce
1 1/2 c  Unbleached flour; sifted
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Cinnamon; ground
Combine the raisins and water in a small saucepan.  Bring the
mixture to a
boil then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 1 minute.
Remove from
the heat and stir in the applesauce.  Cool to lukewarm.  Sift the
flour, baking soda, and spices together into a small bowl and set
aside.  Cream the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl until light and
fluffy, using an electric mixer set on medium.  Beat in the egg and
vanilla.  Add the dry ingredients alternately with the applesauce
mixture, into the creamed mixture, beating well after each addition.
Stir in the walnuts.  Turn the mixture into a greased and waxed paper
lined 9 X 5 X 3-inch loaf pan.

Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 1 hour or until a cake
tester or wooden pick comes out clean when inserted in the center of
the loaf. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before turning out on a wire
rack to finish cooling.
