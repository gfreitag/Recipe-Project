Categories: Diabetic, Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1    Basic pie crust, bottom
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/8 t  Cloves
1/2 t  Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Fruit sweetener
2    Eggs
1 2/3 c  Milk
1 2/3 c  Canned pumpkin
1/2 t  Salt
1 1/4 t  Cinnamon
1/4 t  Ginger
1/8 t  Nutmeg
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare and partially bake the pie
crust according to the directions. Meanwhile, prepare the pumpkin pie
filling. In a medium size bowl, whisk together the pumpkin, salt,
spices and vanilla. Stir in the sweetener and the eggs. When the
mixture is smooth, stir in the milk. Pour the pumpkin pie mix into
the partially baked crust. Bake the pumpkin pie in the preheated oven
for about 1 hour on a cookie sheet placed on either the floor of a
gas oven or the lowest shelf in an electric ove. Pumpkin Pie is done
when the center no longer wiggles when you shake the pan. Pumpkin Pie
is wonderful hot from the oven or at room temperature, or chilled. It
is even more wonderful topped with whipped cream. Submitted By JANE
