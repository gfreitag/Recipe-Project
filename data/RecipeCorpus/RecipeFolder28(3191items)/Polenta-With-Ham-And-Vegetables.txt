tested for 900 watt microwave. Lower powered ovens may mean longer
times.

POLENTA: Combine cornmeal, sugar, salt, if desired, water, milk, and
onion in 3-3t microwave-safe casserole. Stir to mix well. Microwave,
uncovered, on high power 8 to 9 mins, stopping and stirring with wire
whisk after 3 and 6 mins. After cooking, stir again with wire whisk
until mixture is smooth. Cover with lid and microwave an additional 6
to 7 mins on high power. Remove from microwave and let stand an
additional 3 to 4 mins.

HAM & VEGETABLES: Meanwhile, in large, non-stick skillet, combine
onion, garlic, and olive oil. Cook over medium heat, stirring
frequently, until onion begins to soften, about 4 to 5 mins.

Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, ham, zucchini, green pepper, bay leaf,
thyme, oregano, and pepper. Stir to mix well. Bring to a boil.
Simmer, uncovered, until vegetables are tender and sauce has
thickened somewhat, about 15 mins. Remove bay leaf.

TO SERVE: Spoon a portion of polenta onto each plate. Top with
ham-vegetable mixture. Garnish with Parmesan cheese, if desired.
