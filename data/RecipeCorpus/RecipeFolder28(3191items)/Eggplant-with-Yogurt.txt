Title: Eggplant with Yogurt
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Turmeric
1 ts Cumin
1 ts Salt
1 c  Ogurt

This is a fairly simple Eggplant dish made with yogurt. If you aren't
crazy about eggplant, you can adapt this to use zucchini or other
squash; just watch the cooking times! Roast the eggplant in a 350F
oven for 1 hour or until tender. When cool, peel and cut into cubes.
Brown the onion in 2 Tbsp of the oil. Add ginger, garlic, coriander,
cayenne, turmeric, cumin and salt. Fry for several minutes. Add the
remaining 2 tbsp oil and the eggplant cubes. Cook about 5 minutes.
Just before serving, stir in the yogurt and sugar. Serve with (but
not necessarily ON) basmati rice.
