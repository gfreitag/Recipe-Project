MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------

1/2 c  Finely chopped green

1 1/2 c  Water
2    Preserved lemons or limes;

Oil for cooking
3 md Onions; finely chopped
pn Saffron (generous pinch);
*Or a mixture of coriander and parsley--the dish will not taste as
authentic without coriander

Rub the chicken pieces with garlic and lemon.  Mix all the marinade
ingredients together and marinate the chicken overnight.  The next day
remove the chicken and livers from the liquid, dry the pieces and
brown them in the oil in a heavy casserole.  Remove the pieces and
set them aside.  In the pan add the marinade, 1/3 of the chopped
onions, the saffron and coriander.  Add the water and bring to the
boil. Add the chicken and simmer gently for about 20 minutes.  Take
out the livers, mash them and return to the sauce with the rest of
the onions. Cook for another 10-15 minutes, partially covered.  Add
the preserved lemons and the olives and cook for 10 minutes more.
Then place the chicken, olives and lemons on a serving dish.  Reduce
the sauce by boiling rapidly, add the lemon juice and pour over the
chicken.
