Clean cauliflower and break the head into pieces. Cook until just
tender, then place in cold water to cool quickly. In a food processor
or blender, make a coarse puree out of the cooked cauliflower. (Don't
let the puree become too smooth, you want to have some texture to the
final dish.)

In a large bowl beat the eggs slightly and add the milk and salt and
pepper to taste. Add the cauliflower and mix well.

Use 1 Tbsp of the butter/margarine to grease a 8 x 8-inch baking dish
and pour in the mixture. Cut the rest of the butter/margarine into
small pieces and distribute on the top. Top with the grated Parmesan
Cheese. Bake at 450 F for 20 mins or until top is golden brown.
