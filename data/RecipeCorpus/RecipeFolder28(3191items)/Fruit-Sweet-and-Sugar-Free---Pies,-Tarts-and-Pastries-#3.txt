Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Pies, Tarts and Pastries #3
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 servings  Pies, Tarts and Pastries (Cont'd) *********************************
Fork-Edged Crust: ***************** Use the dull side of a small
knife to trim the pastry even with the outer edge of the pan. Then
pres the tines of a fork, lightly dusted with flour, around the top
edge to decorate the edge and to seal the pie if it is a
double-crusted or lattice-topped pie.

Tart Pan Crust: *************** You must have a 3/4 inch edge of
pastry extending beyond the tart pan. Fold this pastry to the inside
of the tart, building strength into the sides of the tart. Use your
fingers to press the dough against the side, both to seal the pastry
and to form an even top edge.

Crusts for Tartlet Pans: ************************ Line each pan with a
round of pastry, easing it into the corners. Pastry should reach and
be even with the top of the pan. Use the tines of a fork to prick the
bottom of each tartlet shell a couple of times.

Crusts for Tartlets in Muffin Tins:
*********************************** Line each muffin cup with a round
of pastry, easing it into the corners and around the sides of each
cup. The pastry will not reach the top of the muffin cups, so use
your fingers to pat and slightly extend the top edge of the pastry to
make it even. Use the tines of a fork to prick the bottom of each
tartlet shell a couple of times.

Bottom of a Double Crust Pie: ***************************** Use the
dull side of a small knife to trim the pastry even with the outer
edge of the pan.

Double Crusted Pie: ******************* Fill the pie with 5-8 cups of
filling. Then brush Egg Wash on the edge of the bottom crust. Unroll
the pastry for the top crust over the paie and press it onto the edge
with your fingers. Use the tines of a fork to seal the top and bottom
crusts together at the edge. Use the dull side of a small knife to
trim off any pastry extending beyond the pie pan.

Lattice-Crust Pie: ****************** Roll the dough out to form a 10
inch by 12 inch rectangle. Cut even strips 1/2 inch to 1-1/4 inch
wide along the length of the pastry rectangle. Beginning in the
center of the filled pie, interweave the lattice strips, leaving a
space between the strips equal to the width of the strips you are
using. Brush egg wash on the rim of the pie. Cover the rim all the
way around, on top of the ends of the lattice strips, with more
strips, placed end to end and cut to fit, as necessary. Seal the
pastry together with the tines of a fork. Use the dull side of a
small knife to trim off any pastry extending past the edge of the pie
pan. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   03-11-95
