CHICKEN: In large, non-stick, spray-coated skillet, cook chicken over
medium heat until cooked through. Remove and set aside in medium bowl.
Reserve skillet.

RISOTTO: In 2 1/2-qt microwave-safe casserole, combine rice and oil.
Microwave, uncovered 60 secs on high. Stir well. Add broth and
pepper. Stir to mix well. Cover with casserole lid and microwave 6 to
7 mins, turning casserole 1/4 turn during microwaving. Uncover, stir
and microwave an additional 11 to 12 mins or until rice is tender and
most liquid is absorbed. Let stand 2 to 3 mins. (NOTE: tested in 900
watt microwave; adjust times for your microwave).

SAUCE AND GARNISH: Meanwhile, in skillet in which chicken was cooked,
combine onion, green pepper, garlic, oil, and broth. Cook over medium
heat, stirring frequently, until onion is tender, 5 to 6 mins. Stir
in milk, Italian seasoning, and reserved chicken. Cook, uncovered,
over medium heat 3 to 4 mins. Stir chicken mixture into risotto.
Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
