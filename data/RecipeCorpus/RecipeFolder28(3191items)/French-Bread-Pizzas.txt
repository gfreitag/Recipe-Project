Title: French Bread Pizzas
Categories: Breads, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Homemade pizza sauce
1 c  Shredded mozzarella cheese
1 x  Sourdough french bread
1 x  Small chopped onion
1 x  Pepperoni or sausage
Take bread and cut lengthwise, then cut in half again. Top with
homemade pizza sauce(use more than 1 cup if desired), onion, cheese
and sausage. Place in a shallow pan and bake at 350 until cheese is
bubbly and melted. Place under broiler to brown, a few minutes.
SUGGESTIONS: Any of the usual pizza toppings may be used. Homemade
bread and sauce is best, but store bought may be substituted(but
why???) A good homemade sourdough french baguette loaf is simply
wonderful for this. Kids just love it!!! Submitted By MARK MIKLAS
