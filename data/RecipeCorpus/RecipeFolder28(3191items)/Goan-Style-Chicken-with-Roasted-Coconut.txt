Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2    One in cube ginger chopped
9    Cloves garlic
3/4    Fresh hod green chili
2 1/4 c  Water
6 tb Vegetable oil
3    Medium onions, minced
3 1/3 lb Chicken parts, skinned
2 1/4 ts Salt
2 1/4 tb Coriander seeds
2 1/4 ts Whole cumin
1 1/2 ts Whole black mustard seeds
1 1/2    One inch stick cinnamon
6    Hole cloves
3/8 ts Whole black peppercorns
3/8 ts Ground nutmeg
1 1/2    Whole dried hot red chili
3 c  Grated fresh coconut
Put the coriander seeds,  cumin seeds,  mustard seeds, cinnamon,
cloves, peppercorns,  nutmeg  and red chili in a small frying pan.
Place over a medium  flame.
Now  quickly  'dry-roast'  the  spices,  stirring them frequently
until they emit a very pleasant 'roasted' aroma. Empty the spices
into a clean coffee grinder or spice grinder and  grind  until fine.
Put spiced in bowl. Put the coconut into the same frying pan and dry
roast it over a medium flame, stirring all the time. The coconut
should pick up lots of brown flecks and also smell roasted. Put the
coconut in the bowl with the other dry roasted spices. Put the
garlic, ginger, and green chili into the container  of  an electric
blender, along with some water. Blend until you have a paste. Heat
the oil in a 10-12 inch frying pan or saute pan over a medium high
flame. When hot put in the onions. Stir and fry them until they pick
up brown spots. Now pour in the garlic-ginger mixture and stir once.
Turn heat to medium. Put in the chicken pieces, salt, as well as the
spice coconut mixture in the bowl. Stir and fry the chicken for 3-4
minutes or until it loses its pinkness and turn heat to low, and cook
for 25 to 30 minutes or until chicken is tender. Stir a few times
during this cooking period, making sure that you turn over each piece
of chicken so that it gets evenly colored.
