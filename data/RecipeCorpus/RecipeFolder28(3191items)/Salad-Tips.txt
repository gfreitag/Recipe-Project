THE LEMON TRIO. While you're buying fresh lemons, better lay in some
canned or frozen lemon juice, too. Both come all ready for use
whenever recipe calls for juice. Just follow directions on label.

THOSE RED, RIPE, JUICY TOMATOES. We agree- they're wonderful in tossed
salad; but they do thin dressing. So add them at last minute. Also,
cut them French way- in vertical slices; they lose less juice.

WATER CRESS, PARSLEY, OR MINT- CRISP AND PERKY. Open up bunch; clean
and wash well; drain well, too. Store loosely, separate from other
salad greens, in covered jar or container in refrigerator.

PEELED TOMATOES PREFERRED. Hold each tomato on fork over the flame,
turning tomato until skin is blistered. Or cover tomato with boiling
water a minute or so. Then you can peel off skin in no time, cut out
stem end, and chill tomato.
