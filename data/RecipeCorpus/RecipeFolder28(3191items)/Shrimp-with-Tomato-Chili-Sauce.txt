Seafood never had it so good, and neither have you with this unique
blend of chili and sauteed shrimp that has a distinctive Thai
influence.

SAUTE GREEN PEPPER, shallots, jalapeno pepper and garlic in oil until
tender in small saucepan. Stir in herbs; cook over medium heat 1
minute. Stir in broth, catsup, vinegar and soy sauce; heat to boiling.

REDUCE HEAT and simmer, uncovered, until cooked to thick sauce
consistency (about 1 cup). Remove from heat and let stand 2 to 3
minutes; stir in NutraSweet Spoonful. Serve warm with shrimp.
