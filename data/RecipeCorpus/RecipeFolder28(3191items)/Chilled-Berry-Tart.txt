1. For crust, in a medium mixing bowl combine crushed graham crackers,
crushed vanilla wafers, and walnuts. Add melted margarine or butter;
toss to mix well. Press crumb mixture onto bottom and 1 1/2 inches up
the sides of a 9-inch springform pan to form a firm, even crust. Bake
in a 375 F oven for 5 mins. Cool on a wire rack.

2. In a medium saucepan soften gelatin in the grape juice for 5 mins.
Cook and stir over low heat till gelatin dissolves. Transfer geletin
mixture to a bowl. Chill about 1 hour or until partially set
(consistency of unbeaten egg whites), stirring occasionally. (Start
watching mixture closely after 40 mins.)

3. Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl combine the cream cheese, sugar,
and vanilla. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed till smooth.
Spread mixture over bottom of cooled crust. Spoon half of the gelatin
mixture over cream cheese layer. Top with half of the blueberries,
all of the sliced strawberries, and the the remaining blueberries.
Spoon the remaining gelatin mixture over the berries.

4. Chill tart for 4 to 6 hours or till set. To serve, loosen crust
from sides with a narrow spatula; remove the sides of the springform
pan. If desired, garnish with slivers of lime peel. Makes 12 to 16
servings.
