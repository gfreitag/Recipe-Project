Cut chicken into serving pieces. Heat half the ghee in a small frying
pan, fry almonds until golden; drain. Fry sultanas for a few seconds
and set aside. Fry peeled and halved potatoes until brown, drain and
reserve. Pour any ghee left in the pan into a large saucepan, add
remaining ghee and fry onion, garlic and ginger until onion is soft
and golden. Add chilli, pepper, turmeric, cummin, salt & tomato. Fry,
stirring constantly for 5 mins. Add yoghurt, mint, cardamom and
cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat stirring occassionally
until tomato is cooked to a pulp. (It may be necessary to add a
little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to
the pan). When mixture is thick and smooth, add chicken pieces and
stir well to coat them with spice mixture. Cover & cook over very low
heat until chicken is tender, approx. 35-45 minutes. There should be
very little thick gravy left when chicken is cooked. If necessary,
cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce gravy. B) Briyani Rice
Wash rice well and drain in colander for at least 30 minutes. Heat
ghee and fry onion until golden. Add saffron, cardamom, cloves,
cinnamon stick, aromatic ginger and rice. Fry stirring, until rice is
coated with the ghee. Add rose water and salt to hot stock, pour over
rice mixture and stir well. Add chicken savoury and potatoes and
gently mix into rice. Bring to boil. Cover saucepan tightly, turn
heat to very low for 20 minutes. DO NOT lift lid or stir while
cooking (Impt!). Spoon briyani onto a warm serving dish. Garnish with
almond & sultanas and serve immediately. GARNISH CUCUMBER RAITA 2
