Categories: Salads, East europe

Peel the cucumbers and slice them very thin and even. Place into a
bowl and add the garlic and salt.  Let stand for 1-2 hours. The
cucumbers will release a lot of water.  Press the cucumber slices and
discard the liquid. Add the sugar, vinegar, diced green onion and
stir well. Sprinkle with the paprika.  Let the salad marinade for at
least 1 hour in the refrigerator. Note:  Plain yogurt can be
substituted for all or part of the vinegar, and a few caraway seed
can be sprinkled into the salad. A little diced dillweed can also be
used instead of the caraway seeds.
