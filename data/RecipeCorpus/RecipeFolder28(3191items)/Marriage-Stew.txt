Categories: Information
Yield: 2 full svgs
2 cn Trust
2    Well rounded measures sex
999 lb Honest friendship
2    Concerned persons
2    Cups love
2 pn Understanding
2 ts Patience
With the above ingredients on hand let's get started on our happy
chore of putting a good, wholesome, hearty marriage stew.

First combine the two concerned persons with the two cups of love in
an adequate, comfortable mixing area.  Next blend in the
understanding and patience and beat lightly with a spoon made of
laughter until the mixture is smooth and fluffy.

Now add the two cans of trust and pour the mixture into the casserole
of life and place over very low heat to simmer.  This is also the
time to add tears, dreams, touching, remembering or any other spices
you feel will make your stew more exciting.  As the mixture is
simmering, saute the sex in tenderness and perhaps a little wine on
special occasions. Add this to the main casserole until the desired
strength is reached.

While the stew is cooking, you might want to sprinkle in a little
singing, dancing, playing or praying  -  you be the judge.  Cook to
taste; garnish with a kiss or two and serve with the honest
friendship.
