Title: Tangy Cucumber And Mung Bean Sprout Salad
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
Substituted or these could
Be omitted
4    To 5 fresh waterchestnuts
(canned are also okay)
2    To 3 large cucumbers
2 c  Mung bean sprouts
3    To 4 cups fresh pea greens
If you can find them--a
Leafy sprout could be
2 Tbs. light soy sauce 1 Tbs. cider vinegar 1 Tbs. freshly minced
garlic x several splashes to 1 tsp. Tabasco sauce (no, really, it
works!) 1 Tbs. black bean sauce 1/4 tsp. fresh ground pepper

Peel the cucumber, slice it down the middle and remove the seeds. Cut
each half down the middle and slice these strips into bite sized
pieces.

Toss cucumbers and mung bean sprouts into a large sealable container.
Mix the dressing separately and pour over the veggies.  Put the lid
on the container and shake it.  Put it in the fridge to marinate for
3 hours or over night, shaking it whenever you think of it. :)

Just before serving add the pea greens and peeled, chopped
waterchestnuts and shake the whole thing together again.
