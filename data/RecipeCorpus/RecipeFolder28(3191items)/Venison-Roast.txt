2 x  Apples, cored and sliced
1 x  Salt and pepper, to taste
2 tb Flour

Wash meat well in ice cold water and let stand in same for 30
minutes. Cut any fat or gristle off meat. Mix flour and salt and
pepper(heavy on the pepper, light on the salt) and dredge meat in
flour mixture; braise in hot oil to brown and seal. Place meat in a
heavy dutch oven or roasting pan(must have good seal) and top with
chopped vegetables. Cover all with sliced apples. Bake in a low(300 -
325) oven 2-1/2 to three hours, do not open cover. Serve with small
new boiled potatoes and a fresh green salad. Shoulder blade roast or
shank steaks work best, the leaner the better. Submitted By MARK
