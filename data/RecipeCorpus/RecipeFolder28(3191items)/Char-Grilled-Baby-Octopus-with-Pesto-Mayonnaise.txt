1/2 c  Whole egg  mayonnaise
2 lb Baby octopus, cleaned,
-halved  1 Clove garlic,

1/4 c  Ready-made pesto
1/2 c  Red wine
Place octopus, garlic, sugar, wine and thyme in a bowl and marinate
for1-2 hours. Cook on a hot bbq plate, tossing regularly until
octopus is cooked and tender. To Make Pesto Mayonnaise- Mix together
mayonnaise and pesto. Serve with octopus as a dip or spoon over as a
sauce. A very simple way to bbq octopus is to marinade it in a
mixture of olive oil, fresh lemon juice, crushed garlic and fresh
parsley. After cleaning the octopus, brush with marinade and bbq
for10 mins. The octopus will curl and then turn a claret red colour
which looks very attractive in a garlic salad. If octopus is tough,
tenderise before cooking by steaming for about 4-5 mins.
