1/2 ts Almond extract
1 tb Sherry

I usually use a yellow cake mix, and pecans or walnuts, but it
ought to be good with almonds too. The recipe I adapted it from used
2 Tbl. of poppyseeds instead of the nuts.

Cake:

Beat all ingredients together for 3 min. Pour into a greased bundt
pan or 10 inch tube pan and bake at 350 F. for 45 minutes. Allow to
rest for 10-15 min., then turn out of pan and cool.

Icing:

Combine ingredients in a double boiler, and stir over hot water for
10-15 minutes. Thin with water or thicken with confectioner's sugar
as needed.

Drizzle icing over the cake, and sprinkle with sliced almonds before
it hardens.

Alternate icing:

Heat 6-8 Tbl. confectioner's sugar with enough sherry to make a glaze.
