Recipe by: Skinny One-Pot Meals - ISBN 0-940625-75-X In large skillet,
combine beef, onion, garlic, green pepper, and carrot. Cook over
medium heat, stirring frequently, until beef is browned and onion is
soft, about 7 or 8 mins. Remove skillet from burner. Turn meat
mixture out onto plate covered with paper towels to absorb any excess
fat. Return mixture to skillet, and return to burner.

Add bouillon and tomato paste, stirring to combine well. Stir in
mustard, thyme, marjoram, salt, if desired, black pepper, and hot
pepper sauce, if desired. Simmer, covered, 10 to 12 mins.

Stir in sour cream and cook 1 or 2 mins longer. Serve over baked
potatoes.
