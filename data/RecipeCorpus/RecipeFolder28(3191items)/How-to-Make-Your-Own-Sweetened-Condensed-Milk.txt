Title: How to Make Your Own Sweetened Condensed Milk
Categories: Information
Yield: 4 cups
1/2    Vanilla bean
6 c  Whole milk
4 1/2 c  Sugar
Heat the milk and sugar in a heavy saucepan over medium-low heat with
the vanilla bean, which has been split lengthwise, scraped with the
back edge of a knife and added to the milk--pod, seeds, and all.

When the sugar is dissolved, raise the heat to medium-high and hold
between a simmer and a boil, stirring occasionally, for about 1 hour.
Be sure the milk doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.  The milk
will thicken, turn beige, and darken to light tan.

Strain into a bowl and cool.  The "condensed" milk will have reduced
to 4 1/2 cups.  It will keep several weeks, covered, in the
refrigerator.

How to use your sweetened condensed milk:

Use in equal amounts in recipes that call for canned sweetened
condensed milk, particularly in baked custards.

Try in hot coffee, in the Latin American tradition, or in iced
coffee, in the Southeast Asian tradition.

Use over fruits, as sauce, and in other desserts that call for
sweetened condensed milk.
