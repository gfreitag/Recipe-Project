SPECIAL EQUIPMENT: Six 4 1/2-inch fluted tartlette pans with
removable bottoms.

Make the cocoa almond crust:
Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350
degrees F.
In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal chopping
blade,
place the flour, sugar, almonds, cocoa powder and salt. Process
the dry
ingredients for 30 to 45 seconds, until the almonds are coarsely
chopped. Add the butter pieces and the vanilla to the bowl and
pulse the
mixture 5 or 6 times until incorporated but still crumbly. Add
the ice
water and pulse a few more times to form a dough.

Divide the dough mixture (it will still be crumbly) among six 4
1/2 inch
tartlette pans with removable bottoms. Using your fingertips,
press the
dough into the bottom and up the sides of each pan. Place the
tartlette
pans on a baking sheet; place the sheet in the freezer for 45
minutes.

Remove the tartlette shells from the freezer. Cover the pans with
a
sheet of aluminum foil, pressing the foil against the bottom and
sides
of each pan. Fill each pan, over the foil, with ceramic pie
weights or
dried beans. Bake the tartlette shells for 15 minutes. Remove the
foil
and weights. Return the shells to the oven and hake an additional
10
minutes. Cool the tartlette shells on a wire rack completely.

Make the milk chocolate almond filling:
Break the Toblerone bars up into pieces, following the bars'
indentations, and place the pieces into the bowl of a food
processor
fitted with a metal chopping blade. Add the cocoa to the bowl and
process the chocolate for 30 to 45 seconds, until finely ground.
Transfer the chocolate to a medium bowl.

In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a gentle boil. Pour the
hot
cream over the chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to
melt
the chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth. Stir in the almond
extract.
Remove 1 1/2 cups of the filling to another medium bowl. Cover
both
bowls with plastic wrap and allow them to stand at room
temperature for
3 hours.

Fill the cocoa clouds:
Using a hand-held electric mixer set at medium speed, heat the
reserved
1 1/2 cups filling for 1 to 2 minutes until light in color and
fluffy.
Scrape the unwhipped filling onto the tartlette shells, dividing
it
evenly. Use a small metal cake spatula to smooth the filling into
an
even layer in the bottom of each shell. Scrape the whipped
mixture over
this filling, dividing it evenly and smoothing it into an even
layer on
each shell.

Make the cocoa cream:
In a chilled, medium bowl, stir together the cream, sugar, cocoa
and
vanilla (the mixture will not be cohesive). Using a hand-held
electric
mixer set at medium-high speed, beat the mixture until stiff
peaks just
start to form. Cover and refrigerate the cocoa cream until up to
two
hours before serving the cocoa clouds.

Garnish the cocoa clouds:
Remove the tartlettes from the pans. Fill a pastry bag fitted
with a
medium star tip (such as Ateco #5) with the cocoa cream. Pipe the
cream
in a shell pattern over the filling on each tartlette, covering it
completely. Place each cocoa cloud on a dessert plate. Dust
lightly with
cocoa. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 2 hours before
serving.
