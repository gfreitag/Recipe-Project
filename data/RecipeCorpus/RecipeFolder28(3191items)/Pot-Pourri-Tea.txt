Title: Pot-Pourri Tea
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 batch
-peel
2 oz Dried orange petals
1 ts Whole cloves; pounded in a
-mortar
1 tb Ground nutmeg
Few twists of a pepper mill
8 oz Good black tea (not China)
3    Sticks cinnamon bark;
-crumbled
2 tb Cassia bark; crumbled*
4    Whole star anise
3 oz Dried hibiscus flowers
1 oz Coarsely grated fresh orange
*An aromatic bark sometimes called Bastard or Chinese cinnamon.  It
is more pungent than cinnamon and is the main ingredient of the
commercial blend called "Apple Pie Spice" which also contains nutmeg.

Mix all of the ingredients in a mixing bowl with your hands.  Then
spread out on a flat basket or tray and dry in a warm place (such as
an airing cupboard) for a few hours. Store in air-tight tins.  Use
one heaped tablespoon per pot.

The authors suggest drinking the tea without milk, but with a little
bit of sugar and, if you like, a slice of orange.  They also warn to
store the tea away from strong light, otherwise the flavor will be
affected.
