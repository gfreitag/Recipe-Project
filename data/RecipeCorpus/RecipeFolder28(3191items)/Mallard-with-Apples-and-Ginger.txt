Rosendale Road London SE21 8LG METRIC/IMPERIAL U.S. 2 young mallard 2
fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 small apples 2 40 g/1
3 tbsp 30 ml/2 tbsp
1/2 oz softened butter/vegetable margarine
sunflower oil 2 tbsp flour for dredging 4 firm dessert apples such as
Cox's, Reinette, Winesap 4 10 ml/2 tsp ground ginger
2 tsp 5 ml/1 tsp brown sugar
1 tsp 75 ml/3 fl oz Calvados 6 tbsp
150 ml/1/4 pint single (light) cream 2/3 cup watercress, to garnish
Preheat the oven to 230-C/420-F/Mark 8. Season the cavities with salt
and pepper and put a small apple inside each of them. Rub the breasts
with some of the softened butter. Tuck in the tail ends. Place in a
roasting pan with a little of the oil and roast for 25-30 minutes;
for those who like mallard rare 20 minutes will do. Baste often.
About 5 minutes before they are ready, baste the breasts well and
dredge with flour. Baste again and return to the oven. While the
ducks are roasting, peel and quarter the dessert apples. Brown them
in the remaining oil and butter, then sprinkle with the ginger and
brown sugar. Keep warm. Remove the ducks from the oven and keep warm.
Pour off any fat from the roasting pan (leaving the sediment) and
deglaze the pan juices with the Calvados. Strain into a small
saucepan. Bring to the boil quickly and reduce a little. Add the
cream and heat, taking care not to let the sauce boil. Taste for
seasoning. Carve the birds and arrange on a very hot serving dish
with the quartered apples. Watercress, divided into sprigs, gives
colour to the dish. Either pour the sauce on the ducks or serve it
separately.
