Title: Rozha z Tsukrom (Rose Preserve)
Categories: Russian, Holiday
Yield: 10 servings
Juice of one lemon
2 tb Rum
2 c  Rose petals
4 c  Sugar
Pick the petals over, removing any debris, leaves, stamens or
insects.

Coarsely chop 1 cup of petals in a processor then add 1 cup of sugar
and half of the lemon juice, 1 Tb of rum, and another cup of sugar.
Mix for a minute, scraping the sides of the processor bowl.  Repeat
with the rest of the petals and other ingredients.  Pack into small
jars (about 1 cup), rapping lightly to release air bubbles.  Cover
and keep in a cool place.

NOTE: This will last up to a year. It is used sparingly, so small
jars are practical.
