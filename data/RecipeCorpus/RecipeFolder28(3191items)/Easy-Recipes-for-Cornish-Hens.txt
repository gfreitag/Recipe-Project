For a crisp skin and citrus accent, rub the hens with a cut lemon and
brush with melted butter, then stuff each hen with a lemon half and a
thyme sprig. Baste with pan juices during roasting.

For an Asian taste, brush the hens with a mixture of soy sauce, white
wine, and sesame oil and spoon a little into the cavity. Baste with
pan juices during roasting.

For spicy birds, brush the hens with a mixture of grainy and Dijon
mustards, vegetable oil, and a little Tabasco sauce.

For a savory tang, stuff the hens under the breast skin with a
mixture of goat cheese, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, and chopped fresh
basil.
