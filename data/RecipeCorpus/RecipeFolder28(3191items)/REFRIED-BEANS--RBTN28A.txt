Title: REFRIED BEANS  RBTN28A
Categories: Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
2 c  Water or vegetable broth
4 c  Black or pinto beans
Using a blender or food processor, blend approximately one cup of
beans with just enough liquid to get a smooth puree. If any cooked
onion wedges, celery stalks, whole garlic cloves, etc. are available,
puree these along with the beans for flavor. They won't affect the
consistency. Do this in a few batches, if necessary. Place refried
beans in a plastic bowl for storage. If you don't cook for an army,
freeze small amounts in smaller plastic containers. Thaw out in the
refrigerator as needed. For extra zip (do this to a batch the kids
won't be eating!), include fresh jalapenos, canned green chili
peppers, Tabasco sauce, or any ground chili paste product during the
pureeing process. Also include a one-to-one mixture of ground cumin
and oregano for a more authentic Mexican flavor. I add a small amout
of tomato sauce and fresh garlic cloves when pureeing. Be creative.
Just make sure that the consistency of the beans is such that they
will hold their shape in a tortilla. For quick burritos, simply place
2-3 tablespoons of refried beans in a tortilla, heat in a microwave,
and eat! Serve with your favorite salsa or picante sauce. Kids may
prefer to see a sprinkling of cheese over the beans, but you can
always use skim cheese! Non-fat sour cream or fresh chopped tomatoes
are also nice additions.
