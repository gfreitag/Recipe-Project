Success Hints: The original recipe used equal amounts pumpkin, flax
and sunflower seeds. I used what I had on hand at the time; a
combination of sunflower, sesame, poppy, caraway, anise, and fennel
seeds.

The directions say for best results, use the "extra knead" process
and add seeds near the end of the first knead. My machine doesn't
have any such cycle, so I just used the regular setting. In addition,
I added the seeds at the beginning along with all the other
ingredients.

Personal note: I expected to get a short, dense loaf and was
pleasantly surprised at how high it rose. This one's a keeper!
