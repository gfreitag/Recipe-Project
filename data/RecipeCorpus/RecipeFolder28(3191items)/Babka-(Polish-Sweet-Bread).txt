2 pk Dry yeast in

(let stand 5 minutes)
1/2 c  Butter
2 c  Warm water

Into the 2 cups of warm water in a small bowl, add butter and let

bowl. Add the water and melted butter. Mix well. Add the yeast and
water to the flour mixture.  Knead in the bowl until it is no longer
sticky. Cover and let rise one hour in a draft-free place. Dough
should double in size. Punch down and knead again.  Divide dough and
put into two greased loaf pans. Pierce with fork along top to allow
excess air to escape. Let rise until dough is a little higher than
the pans.  Bake in preheated oven at 350 for 1 hour.  Cool in pans 15
minutes. Remove from pans and rub tops with butter so crust will be
soft. Shared By: Pat Stockett
