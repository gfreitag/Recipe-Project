Categories: Vegetarian, Meats
Yield: 8 patties
-or sunflower seeds, peanuts
-or chopped nut meats
3/4 ts Salt
Oil for deep frying
Shoyu
30 oz Tofu
6 tb Carrots; grated
4 tb Leeks, scallions, onions or
-gingerroot; minced
2 tb Ground roasted sesame seeds
Cut tofu into thin slices and arrange between double layers of cotton
toweling. Set aside for 15 minutes, then place pieces at the center
of a dry dish towel.
Gather the corners and twist to form a sack. Squeeze tofu in sack
firmly to expel as much moisture as possible. Combine tofu with next
4 ingredients in a large shallow bowl. Mix well, then knead mixture
about 3 minutes, as if kneading bread. When dough is smooth and holds
togehter well, moisten your palms with a little oil or warm water and
shape dough into 8 patties, each 3 - 3 1/2 inches in diameter.

Fill a wok, heavy skillet, or deep fryer with oil to a depth of 1
1/2- 2 inches. Heat to 300 deg. Slide in patties and deep fry for 4-6
minutes or until they float high in the oil. Turn patties over and
deepfry for several mintues more or until crisp and golden brown.
Drain briefly, then serve crisp and hot, and topped with a sprinkling
of shoyu or between buns with burger trimmings. Leftovers may be
frozen.
