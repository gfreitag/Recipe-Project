Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 servings

1 x  Horse radish
1 x  Catsup
1 x  Chile powder

2 ds Dash of Tabasco
1 x  Cracker meal

Soak filets in Dry white wine about 15-20 Minutes. If you want to
give the fish a little zing, use a little Tabasco in the wine
marinate. Use Cracker meal & Biscuit half & half mixture. Never use
corn meal because it soaks the oil. Use salt & pepper in the coating
to taste. Remove the fish fillets from the marinade, squeezing gently
to remove excess wine. Roll in the batter and drop into a heavy
skillet or kettle of very hot peanut oil. The oil should be hot
enough that the oil foams  up when the fish is dropped into it. Cook
about 30 seconds to a minute and turn fillets over for 30 seconds to
a minute. Sauce:: Mix Horse radish with catsup along with a little
chili powder and lemon juice. Mix to taste.
