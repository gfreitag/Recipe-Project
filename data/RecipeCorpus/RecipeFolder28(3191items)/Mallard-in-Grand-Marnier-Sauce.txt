1
1/2
oil for frying 1 small orange
6 large oranges 6 125 ml/4 fl oz Grand Marnier
cup 10 ml/2 tsp brown sugar 2 tsp This is a simple recipe for an
older bird which needs to be casseroled. Preheat the oven to
180-C/350-F/Mark 4. Season the cavities with salt and pepper and roll
the birds in flour. Brown them all over in heated oil. Cut the small
orange in half and put a half in each bird. Tuck in the tail ends,
and arrange in a medium casserole. Pour over the juice of four of the
oranges and season well with salt and pepper. Cook in the oven for 1
1/2-2 hours, basting frequently with the juice. Meanwhile, pare the
rind from the two remaining oranges and cut it into julienne strips .
Blanch in boiling water and drain well . Peel all the white pith from
the two oranges and divide them into skinned segments; reserve. Place
the julienne strips of orange rind, Grand Marnier and sugar in a
saucepan and bring to the boil quickly. Simmer for a few seconds.
When the birds are cooked, remove them from the casserole and keep
hot. Add the juices from the casserole to the Grand Marnier sauce,
bring back to a simmer and taste for seasoning. Warm the orange
segments in a non-stick pan. Discard the halves of orange from the
duck cavities. Cut the ducks in halves, place them on a hot serving
plate and garnish with the warmed orange segments. Serve the sauce
separately.
