This recipe is an old tradition in Germany. The sauce combines  sweet,
sour, and spicy flavors. In Germany, fresh carp is used, but  since
it is hard to find in the U.S. other fish may be substituted.

Remove head from fish and reserve for making fish stock for other
recipes. Lay fish out as flat as possible, breaking bones along back.
Melt butter in a skillet. Add onion, celery, salt, peppercorns and
cloves and mix. Top with lemon slices and bay leaf. Place fish on
top. Add beer. Cover and simmer 15-20 minutes, or just until fish
flakes with fork. Transfer fish to a platter, cover with foil to keep
warm. Strain cooking liquid, pressing some of the vegetables through.
Put gingersnaps and sugar in s killet, stir in 1-1/2 cups strained
liquid. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Garnish fish with
parsley. Pass sauce for pouring over fish and boiled potatoes as side
dish. Makes 4-6 servings. From the files of Al Rice, North Pole
