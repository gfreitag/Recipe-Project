Snap off and discard the woody bases from the asparagus spears.  If
desired, scrape off the scales.  Cut into 2-inch pieces and set
aside. Cook the potatoes in a small amount of boiling water in a
covered 2-quart saucepan for 10 minutes.  Add the asparagus and cook,
covered, for an additional 8 minutes or until the asparagus is
crisp-tender and the potatoes are tender.  Drain and transfer the
vegetables to a serving bowl. Meanwhile, combine the oil, lemon peel,
salt and thyme to make the dressing.  Add to the vegetables and toss
gently to coat.  If desired, garnish with fresh thyme and a lemon
peel curl.  Serve warm. Makes 4 side-dish servings. Per serving: 105
