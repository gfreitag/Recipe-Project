Dried
3 lb Asparagus (about 3 bunches),
-bottoms trimmed

paper towels and plastic bage; refrigerate.)

Toss the mushrooms with the lemon juice in a medium bowl and season
with salt and pepper.  Whisk the cream and mustard together in a
small bowl to blend, then gradually whisk in the oil.  Let the
mushroom mixture and the dressing stand for 30 minutes or cover and
refrigerate for up to 24 hours.

Arrange the asparagus on a serving platter.  Whisk the tarragon into
the dressing.  Drain the mushrooms well and return to the bowl. Mix
in the dressing and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Spoon the
mushroom dressing over the asparagus and serve.

NOTE:  "Here's an easy, make-ahead recipe that's our nominee for best
side dish.  If asparagus in unavailable, steamed broccoli is a nice
substitute."

Makes 8 servings.
