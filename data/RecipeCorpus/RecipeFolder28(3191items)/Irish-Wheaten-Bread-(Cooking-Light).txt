"The secret to this tender bread is in your hands:  don't overwork the
dough--just lightly knead it."

The caption under the accompanying photo says "Irish Wheaten Bread
splits around the middle as it bakes, sort of like a large biscuit."

Combine first 5 ingredients in food processor and pulse until
well-blended. With the processor on, drop margarine through food
chute, and process for 10 seconds.

Combine buttermilk and egg whites; stir well.  With the processor on,
pour the mixture through food chute, and process for 20 seconds or
until dough leaves sides of bowl and forms a ball.  Turn the dough
out onto a lightly floured surface and lightly knead about 10 times.

Pat the dough into an 8-inch round cake pan coated with cooking
spray, and cut a 1/4-inch-deep X in top of the dough.  Bake at 375
deg. F for 45 minutes or until lightly browned.  Remove bread from
pan and let cool completely on a wire rack.  Cut bread into wedges.
