stirring more frequently, and cook it for about 30 minutes or until
it thickens. Allow to cool a little. Meanwhile, gently heat oil in
large saucepan. Add the rice and stir for about 1 minute, seasoning

rice into a dish and spoon the chutney over it, scattering the cashew
nuts on top before serving.
