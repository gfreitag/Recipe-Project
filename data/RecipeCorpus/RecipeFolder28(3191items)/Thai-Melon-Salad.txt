This recipe, from the City Restaurant and Border Grill in Los Angeles,
presents melons in a sweet and savory context. In order to have a
contrast of colors and flavors, use portions of several melons. The
recipe calls for approximately 2 pounds of prepared melon about half
a pound per person. The specialty items may be found in Thai grocery
stores.

Cut the melons into small dice or thin ribbons. Arrange on a platter.

Place the chiles, lime juice, fish sauce, palm sugar, pea- nuts, dried
shrimp, crushed lime leaves and garlic puree in a blender; blend until
thoroughly mixed. Pour over the salad and garnish with cilantro
leaves.
