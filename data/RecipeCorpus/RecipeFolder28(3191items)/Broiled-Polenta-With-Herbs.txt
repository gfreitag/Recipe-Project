1. Oil or butter a 1 1/2- or 2-qt loaf pan and set aside. In a large
saucepan, bring water and salt to a boil over high heat. Stir polenta
into boiling water in a slow steady stream. Reduce heat to medium and
continue stirring 5 mins, or until thickened to consistency of hot
cereal. Remove from heat and stir in butter, Parmesan cheese, sage,
rosemary, and pepper. Pour polenta into prepared loaf pan and smooth
top with a spatula. Cook briefly, then cover with plastic wrap.
Refrigerate unti firm, about 6 hours.

2. Preheat broiler. Oil or butter a baking sheet that will fit under
broiler. Remove plastic wrap from loaf pan and slip a knife around
edges to free polenta. Unmold onto a cutting board, tapping sharply
to release, if necessary.

3. Cut polenta into 3/4-inch slices and arrange in a single layer on
prepared baking sheet. Broil 3 to 4-inches from heat until polenta
begins to form a golden crust, about 5 mins. Turn polenta with a
spatula and broil on second side until golden, about 4 to 5 mins
longer.
