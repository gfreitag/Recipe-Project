Title: RED LOBSTER CHEESE BISCUITS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 60 servings
44 oz ;Water, cold
1 lb Cheddar, sharp; grated
1/2 c  Butter
1 ts Garlic salt or powder
1 T  Parsley flakes
1 ts Italian seasonings
5 lb Bisquick
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
with garlic powder, parsley flakes and Italian seasoning.  (Amounts
will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
Serve hot. The RL manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll
have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you desire.

Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick, 1/2 cup cold
water, and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will yield about 12 biscuits.

You may also substitute soda water or gingerale for the water, if
desired.
