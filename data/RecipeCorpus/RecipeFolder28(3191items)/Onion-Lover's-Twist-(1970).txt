Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off.  In large bowl,
combine 2 c flour, sugar, salt and yeast; blend well.  In small
saucepan, heat water, milk and 1/4 c butter until very warm (120 to
130 degrees) Add warm liquid and egg to flour mixture.  Blend at low
speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed.  By hand, stir
in remaining 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 c flour to form a soft dough.  Cover
loosely with greased plastic wrap and cloth towel.  Let rise in warm
place (80 to 95 degrees) until light and doubled in size, 45 to 60
minutes.

Grease large cookie sheet.  Melt 1/4 c butter in small saucepan; stir
in remaining filling ingredients.  Set aside.  Stir down dough to
remove all air bubbles.  On floured surface, toss dough until no
longer sticky.  Roll dough into 18 x 12 inch rectangle.  Cut each
rectangle in half crosswise to amek two 12 x 9 inch rectangles; cut
each rectangle into 3 9 x 4 inch strips.  Spread about 2 T onion
mixture over each strip to 1/2 inch of edge.  Bring lengthwise edges
of each strip together to enclose filling; pinch edges and ends to
seal.

On greased cookie sheet, braid 3 rolls together; pinch ends to seal.
Repeat with remaining 3 rolls for second loaf.  Cover; let rise in
warm place until light and doubled in size, 25 to 30 minutes.

Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Uncover dough.  Bake 27 to 35 minutes or
until golden brown and loaves sound hollow when lightly tapped.
Immediately remove from cookie sheet; cool on wire racks.
