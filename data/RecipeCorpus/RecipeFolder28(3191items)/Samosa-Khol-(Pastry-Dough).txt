Categories: Appetizers, Indian
Yield: 1 recipe
1 pn Baking powder
Water, as necessary
3 tb Ghee*
1 c  Whole-wheat flour

Rub the ghee into the flour.  Stir in salt & baking powder & continue

Divide dough into four equal portions & shape into a ball.  Flatten
each portion & then roll out into a thin, round disk.  Cut each disk
