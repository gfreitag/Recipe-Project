1/2    All-purpose flour

are a "sturdy" potato dumpling served as a side dish to meat, and
usually with a sweet sauerkraut/carraway/honey dish as the vegetable.

Boil peeled potatoes in small quantity of water. Drain potatoes
thoroughly. Rice potatoes through hand held masher/ricer. Let
potatoes cool. On floured board, gradually add flour working mixture
into dough with hands. Shape potato mixture into a long roll and cut
into 10 slices. Drop dumplings into boiling water and boil gently
about 5 minutes.

Drain dumplings on paper towel.  The dumplings are fully cooked after
the boiling process, but traditionally, Czechoslovakians then melt
butter in a heavy frying pan, and fry the dumplings until they are
lightly browned on all sides.
