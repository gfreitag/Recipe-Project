Recipe by: McDougall Preparation Time: 0:30 Mix dry ingredients
together in a medium bowl. Add optional spices, if desired. Mix honey
and warm water together, then add to dry ingredients, stirring just
until mixed. Pour into lightly oiled or non-stick 8-inch square
baking dish. Bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes.

HELPFUL HINTS: Various spices may be added for different flavors.
Pieces of finely chopped or grated vegetables also may be added. Try
finely chopped onion, finely chopped green pepper, chopped green
chilis, chopped pimiento, grated carrots, grated zucchini. Used alone
or in various combinations, they add special appeal to this simple,
tasty corn bread. If you have a nonstick baking pan, it is not
necessary to oil it first. This recipe also may be used for muffins.
Increase baking powder to 4 teaspoons. Fill oiled or papered muffin
tins two-thirds full. Bake at 375 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes. From
