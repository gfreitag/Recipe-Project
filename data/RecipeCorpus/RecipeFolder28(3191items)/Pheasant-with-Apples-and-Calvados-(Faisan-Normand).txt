Rosendale Road London SE21 8LG METRIC/IMPERIAL U.S. 2 young plump
pheasants 2 4 large cooking (tart) apples
4 40 g/1 1/2 oz butter/vegetable
3 tbsp 30 ml/2 tbsp corn or sunflower oil
margarine
2 tbsp 1 1/2 wineglasses Calvados 1 1/2 wineglasses
150 ml/1/4 pint stock 1/3 cup fine sea salt and freshly ground black
pepper icing (confectioners') sugar 300 ml/1/2 pint single (light) or
double double (heavy) cream 1 1/4 cups There are many variations of
this wonderful combination of flavours and tastes. The pheasant can
be cooked whole or jointed. The apples can be cooked in with the
pheasant or added later. Whatever the variation you follow, the main
ingredients are always: pheasant, apples, Calvados and fresh cream.
We have tried many different versions, and the following is our
favourite for this delicious warming winter dish. Preheat the oven to
180-C/350-F/Mark 4. Cut each pheasant into six pieces (as a chicken
is jointed) or leave whole. Peel, core and slice two of the apples.
Heat 15 g/1/2 oz (1 tbsp) of the butter with the oil in a heavy
frying pan and brown the pheasant joints; remove. Saute the sliced
apples in the pan until tender. Place the sliced apples in a
flame-proof casserole and arrange the pheasants on top. Pour over the
Calvados, stock and any juices left in the pan and season well with
salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, cover and cook in the oven for
30-40 minutes. Peel and core the remaining two apples and cut into
rings. Saute them in the remaining butter and sprinkle with sugar to
caramelise. Remove the pheasants to a hot serving dish. Reduce the
sauce a little, then add the cream and heat gently- do not let the
sauce boil if single (light) cream is used. Pour the sauce over the
pheasant pieces or serve it separately (cut the pheasant in half if
it was cooked whole). Garnish with the apple rings.
