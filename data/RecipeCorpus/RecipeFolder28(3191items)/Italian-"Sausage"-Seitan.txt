Title: Italian "Sausage" Seitan
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 t  Paprika
1/2 t  Black pepper
1    Egg white
1/4 c  Bread crumbs
1/2 c  TVP
3/8 c  Boiling water
1/4 t  Garlic salt
1/4 t  Garlic powder
1/4 t  Ground fennel
Mix the TVP into the hot water. Let stand for a few minutes. Add
everything else and form into two patties. Fry in non-stick pan.

It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. If anyone makes it I'd appreciate
comments and suggestions.
