Mixing well-loved flavors such as peanut butter with less familiar
flavors such as fish makes fish more acceptable to children.
Marinating the halibut for 4-6 hours before cooking enhances the
peanut flavor without adding work. Alaska halibut is a mild flavored
whitefish with a firm, meaty texture that appeals to all ages.

Cut center bone and skin from halibut steaks and cut into 1-inch
chunks. Place peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice and honey in
blender. Blend until smooth. The mixture should be thick. Place
peanut butter mixture in a glass dish and roll each halibut chunk in
mixture, evenly coating all sides. Then roll halibut chunks in
crushed corn flakes to coat. Place on a greased baking sheet and bake
in upper half of oven at 450" for 3-5 minutes, or until fish just
flakes when tested with a fork. Makes 4-6 From the files of Al Rice,
