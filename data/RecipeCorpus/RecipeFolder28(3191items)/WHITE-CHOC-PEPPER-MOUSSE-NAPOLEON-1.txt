Make the apricot compote:
In a medium saucepan, combine the apricots, water, sugar and
orange
liqueur. Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally,
until
the sugar dissolves . Bring the mixture to a boil; reduce the
heat to
medium-low and simmer the mixture for 5 minutes. Remove the pan
from the
heat and allow it to cool for 15 minutes. Remove 12 whole
apricots from
the compote and set them aside for garnish. Pour the remaining
compote
into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade.
Process
the mixture for 30 to 45 seconds, until smooth. Transfer the
pur√©e to a
small bowl, cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Make the ginger-sesame tuiles:
In a small bowl place the flour, sesame seeds and ginger. Using a
whisk,
gently stir the dry mixture until combined.

In a medium saucepan combine the butter, sugar and honey. Cook the
mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter
is
melted, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a 4 l/2-quart
bowl of a
heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. At
low
speed, gradually add the dry flour mixture to the butter-honey
mixture.
Scrape down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Continue
to mix
the batter at low speed until just warm, about 5 minutes. Cover
the bowl
and allow the batter to sit at room temperature for 2 hours.

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 F.
Spray a
baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Drop two 1 teaspoon-size
balls
of the batter onto the sheet, 6 inches apart (begin by baking
only 2
tuiles at a time, to get an idea of how they will spread in your
oven).
Bake the tuiles for 4 to 6 minutes, until golden brown. Allow the
tuiles
to cool for 3 to 5 minutes on the baking sheet, then carefully
transfer
them with a spatula to a wire rack to cool completely. Continue
this
baking process, respraying the baking sheet as necessary, until
all the
batter is used.
