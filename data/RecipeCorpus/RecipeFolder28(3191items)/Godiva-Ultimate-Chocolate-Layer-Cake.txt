3 oz UNSWEETENED CHOCOLATE,

1 c  BUTTERMILK
1 c  GODIVA LIQUEUR, DIVIDED
SHAVED CHOCOLATE
2 c  SIFTED FLOUR
1 ts BAKING SODA
1/4 ts SALT
6 oz UNSALTED BUTTER
1 1/3 c  SUGAR
3    LARGE EGGS
For the buttercream, cream the butter until smooth. Sift the sugar
and cocoa powder over the butter, add 1/3 cup of Godiva Liqueur and
slowly mix until smooth.

For the cake, sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set
aside. Cream the butter and sugar and add the eggs one at a time,
beating after each addition. On low speed, stir in the chocolate and
gradually add the reserved sifted ingredients in three additions,
alternating with the buttermilk and 1/2 cup of Godiva Liqueur, beat
until smooth. Divide the batter among three greased and floured
9-inch cake pans. Bake in preheated 375 degrees  oven for 25 minutes
until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean.
Remove from the oven and cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then invert
onto a rack to completely cool. Chill the layers in the freezer for
about 30 minutes, until firm.

To assemble the cake, remove the cake layers from the freezer and
brush with the remaining Godiva Liqueur before spreading 3/4 cup of
buttercream between each layer. Spread the remaining buttercream over
the top and sides of the cake, which has been placed on a serving
plate. Serve immediately, or refrigerate if necessary. If
refrigerating, remove 1 hour prior to serving. Garnish with shaved
chocolate. Serves twelve.
