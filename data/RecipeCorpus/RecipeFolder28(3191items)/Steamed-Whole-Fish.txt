Categories: Chinese, Fish
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Dry gin
1/2 ts Sugar
Cornstarch paste
2 tb Peanut oil
1    Sprig Chinese parsley
2 lb Whole fish (cleaned weight)

For more people, use more than one fish.  Each fish should be no more
than 2 lbs. unless you have a very large steamer. Have your
fishmonger clean and scale fish, leaving head and fins intact. You
can tell if fish is fresh by the clearness of the eyes and a red tint
on the inner edge of the gills. Wash and pat dry, rub with salt.
Allow to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

On both sides of fish, make parallel diagonal cuts 1" apart through
meaty section.  Trim and shred scallions diagonally in 2" lengths.
Peel and shred fresh ginger root. Place pieces of scallion and ginger
in cuts.

Place fish on greased plate.  Steam at rapid boil for 15 to 25
minutes, depending on size.  Fish is cooked when you can flake flesh.
Overcooking will toughen flesh, so watch closely.

Heat peanut oil in beaker or small saucepan.  In wok, heat stock, gin
and sugar.   When fish is cooked, remove from steamer. Drain juices
into stock mixture. Thicken slightly with cornstarch paste. Pour hot
oil, then stock mixture, over fish.  Garnish with Chinese parsley.
Serve.
