Cook the chicken on a grill or under a very hot broiler in the oven
for about 3 to 5 minutes on each side, depending on their thickness
and the intensity of the heat. (The chicken can also be sauteed in a
frying pan.) Set aside.

In a large frying pan over moderately low heat, melt butter and saute
shallot until translucent, but not browned.  Add pesto, tarragon,
vinegar, jam and wine, season with salt and pepper, and stir to
combine well. Add the chicken and raspberries and cook on low heat
for about 5 minutes, turning the chicken occasionally, to heat
through and blend the flavors. Serve accompanied by pasta.
