% Skip the iceberg lettuce and fill your refrigerator crisper with
greens that are more nutrient dense, such as romaine, spinach and
Swiss chard.

% Carrots and beets are good sources of vitamin A; bell peppers,
broccoli, cabbage and tomatoes add vitamin C.

% Cooked beans and lentils are low fat protein sources.

% Venture beyond pasta to brown rice, barley, couscous, bulgur and
quinoa. All of these grains are flavorful, easy to prepare and
filling.

% Turn a salad into a main dish by adding two ounces of a lean
protein. Try skinless chicken or turkey, broiled lean beef, salmon or
water packed tuna, nonfat or part skim cheese.  For an extra
nutrition boost, skip the croutons and sprinkle on or stir in a few
tablespoons of wheat germ. One serving, about two tablespoons, of
wheat germ has eight essential vitamins and minerals, dietary fiber
and 50 calories. Discover wheat germ's naturally nutty flavor and
crunchy texture.
