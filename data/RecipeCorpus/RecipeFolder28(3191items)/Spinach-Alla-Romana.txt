1. In a nonreactive large frying pan over medium-high heat, cook
spinach, covered, in water that clings to leaves 2 to 3 mins, or until
spinach is wilted but still bright green and all the water is
evaporated. Drain and squeeze to remove excess liquid. Set aside.

2. In a medium frying pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add pine
nuts and garlic and cook, stirring, until garlic is fragrant and pine
nuts are golden, about 30 secs. Add spinach, prosciutto, and raisins
and cook about 2 mins, until heated through. Stir in butter until
melted. Season with salt and pepper.
