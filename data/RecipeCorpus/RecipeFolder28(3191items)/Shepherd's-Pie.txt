Preheat oven to 350 F.

FILLING: Trim off and discard all fat from meat. Cut into very thin
2-inch-long diagonal strips.

In spray-coated Dutch oven or other large oven-proof pot, brown meat
over medium-high heat, about 6 or 7 mins. Remove meat to medium-sized
bowl and reserve.

In Dutch oven, combine onion, garlic, oil, and 3 Tbs broth. Cook over
medium heat, stirring, 6 or 7 mins or until onion is tender. If liquid
begins to evaporate, add more broth.

Return meat to pot with onion and garlic.

Stir in tomato sauce and remaining broth. Stir in carrots, celery, and
green beans. Add bay leaves, thyme, marjoram, mustard, pepper, salt,
if desired, and cayenne. Stir to mix well. Bake, covered, 1 hour or
until meat is tender.

TOPPING: Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, combine potatoes and enough
water to cover. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower heat
and simmer 15 to 17 mins or until potatoes are very tender. Drain
potatoes well in colander.

Return potatoes to pot in which they were cooked, and add remaining
topping ingredients. Mash with potato masher. If mixture seems too
stiff to spread, add a bit more milk.

Remove stew from oven and uncover. Drop potato topping by large
spoonfuls onto bubbling mixture. Carefully spread out topping with
back of large spoon, making attractive peaks.

Return to oven and bake, uncovered, 17 to 20 mins or until potatoes
are heated through and begin to brown.
