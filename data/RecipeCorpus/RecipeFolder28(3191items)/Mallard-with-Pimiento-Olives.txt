24 Season the cavities of the ducks with salt and pepper. Heat the
oil in a frying pan and brown the ducks all over. Remove from the
pan. Cut the medium onions in half and put two halves into the cavity
of each duck. Tuck in the tail ends. Thickly slice the large onion
and the carrots and brown quickly in the oil in the frying pan. Drain
and spread in the bottom of a heavy casserole. Add the bouquet garni.
Place the ducks on top of this vegetable bed. Mix the paprika with
the port or Madeira and pour over the ducks. Cover the casserole with
foil and the lid and cook gently for 60-90 minutes on top of the
stove or in a preheated 180-C/350-F/Mark 4 oven. Baste frequently.
Meanwhile, blanch the olives in boiling water for 3 minutes, drain
and soak in cold water for 20 minutes. Remove the ducks to a hot
serving dish and keep hot. Strain the vegetables and cooking liquid
through a sieve, pressing the mixture through the sieve with the back
of a spoon. Throw away the residue. Skim any fat from the surface of
the sauce. Drain the olives and add them to the sauce. Reheat, and
taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve the ducks with the sauce.
