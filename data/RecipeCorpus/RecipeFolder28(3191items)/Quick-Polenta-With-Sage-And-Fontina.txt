1. Preheat oven to 425 F. In a large saucepan, bring water and salt
to a boil over high heat. Stir polenta into boiling water in a slow
steady stream. Reduce heat to medium and continue stirring 5 mins, or
until thickened to consistency of hot cereal.

2. Remove polenta from heat and stir in 3 Tbs butter, pepper, and
Parmesan cheese. Use remaining 2 Tbs of butter to grease a large
heatproof serving platter. Set aside.

3. Pour polenta onto buttered platter. Scatter sage over top. Cover
with fontina cheese and bake 8 to 10 mins, until cheese has melted
and polenta is heated though.
