Title: Hoppin John #2
Categories: Main dish, Casseroles, Vegetables
Yield: 10 servings
1 tb Chili powder
1 ts Black pepper
2 ts Salt
1 ts Thyme
1 c  Rice
1 lb Dried Blackeyed Peas
2 1/2 qt Water
1 lb Hog Jowls, cubed
1 c  Chopped Onion
1 t  Louisiana hot sauce
Soak peas in water overnight. Fry cubed hog jowls over medium heat
until they begin to brown. Add onion and continue cooking until onion
is tender. Drain off grease. In a large iron pot, combine the soaked
peas with the meat & onion mixture and seasonings. Cover pan, bring
to a boil, then simmer until beans are tender, about one hour. Stir
in rice and cook without stirring 20 min. Be sure that there is
enough water in the mixture to cook the rice.

Variations: Instead of jowls, stew ham hocks in the bean mixture,
remove, cool, cut meat from the bone and return to the pot when the
rice is done.

Use smoked jowls, hocks, cubed bacon or add liquid smoke.

Instead of chili powder and hot sauce, finely chop fresh hot peppers
and a clove of garlic or two.

Substitute sage for thyme.
