set aside.

Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt into medium

Divide batter among prepared cups. Spoon some maple-walnut topping
over each muffin, dividing evenly. Bake until tester inserted into
centres of muffins comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Remove muffins
from pan and cool 15 minutes. Serve warm with maple butter. Source:
