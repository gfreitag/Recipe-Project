When the cake comes out of the oven, it seems dry and firm; however,
it acts as a sponge when the syrup is poured over it. It soaks up the
liquid. You can see it swell as it becomes moist and fluffy.

In a small bowl, combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt and
nutmeg. In a second larger bowl, beat togetherbutter, sugar, eggs,
skim milk and lemon rind. Stir in dry ingredients and fold in
walnuts. Pour into a light greased 8 inch square baking pan. Bake in
a 350 F oven for 25-30 minutes or until a tester inserted in the
center comes out clean. Cool in pan. SYRUP: In a saucepan, combine
water, sweetener, lemon juice, cinnamon stick and cloves.  Bring to a
boil. Prick cake in many places with a fork and pour syrup over cake.
Allow to sit 5-10 minutes for cake to absorb syrup. Cut into pieces
and serve. Store cake, covered, in the refrigerator. Makes 20 snack
size pieces. 9 dessert size pieces.
