CAKE:

To prepare cake, cream butter and sugar until very light and fluffy,
about 5 minutes.  Beat in egg yolks, one at a time.  Mix in lemon
rind and 2 T rum.  Sift baking powder and flour together.  Gently mix
into the butter mixture.  Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry.
Gently fold the egg whites into the batter.  Pour into a well-greased
10-inch tube pan. Bake in a preheated 325 degree F. oven for about 60
minutes or until the cake tests done.  Cool cake in pan for 10
minutes adn then turn out on wire rack to cool completely.  Slice
cake crosswise into 3 layers. Pour about 2 T of rum over each layer.

Butter-Cream Filling:

For butter-cream filling, boil sugar and water to 238 degrees F.
(soft ball stage).  Beat egg yolks until very light and fluffy, 5 to
10 minutes. While still beating the egg yolks, add the sugar syrup in
a thin stream. Beat 5 minutes more, until very thick and doupled in
bulk. Slowly beat in the rum. Beat the butter in a small bowl until
soft and light. Beat butter into the egg mixture a little at a time.
Continue beating until thick. Chill until mixture can be spread.  If
mixture is too soft, beat in additional butter.

PRALINE TOPPING:

While butter-cream is cooking, spread 2 T butter thickly in a 9 X
13-inch baking pan for praline topping.  Then in a 1-quart saucepan,
boil sugar an water to 238 degrees F. (soft ball stage).  Stir in
almonds; cook until mixture reaches 310 degrees F. or until syrup
carmelizes. Pour syrup into prepared baking pan.  When cool, break up
praline and grind it in a blender for a few seconds.

APRICOT GLAZE:

Finally heat jam and press through a strainer or sieve to make apricot
glaze.

CAKE ASSEMBLY:

To assemble cake, place bottom layer of cake on cake plate and spread
with half of the butter cream.  Repeat with second layer.  Place
third layer on top.  Spread top and sides of cake with apricot glaze.
Press praline powder onto glaze.  Any remianing butter cream can be
used to decorate the top of the cake.
