Brown and crispy potatoes are everyone's favorite. You can make a
nutritious meal-in-one by combining grated potatoes with flaked Alaska
canned salmon. Make small pancakes for the kids and garnish with a
sweet and familiar ingredient such as applesauce. Sour cream mixed
with horseradish makes these irresistible for the adults at your
table.

Drain and flake salmon. Peel potatoes and grate using large holes of a
cheese grater. Combine salmon and grated potatoes with remaining
ingredients except vegetable oil and applesauce. Mix well. Heat
vegetable oil in a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Form
potato mixture* into thin patties using 1/3 Cup mixture for each. Fry
in heated skillet for 3 minutes on each side or until crisp golden
brown. Serve with applesauce. Makes 4-6 servings (10-12 salmon potato
cakes). potato mixture will form liqui d as it sits. Drain in
colander and squeeze out excess liquid when forming patties. From the
