1. In an 8-qt Dutch oven, saute the sausage over moderately high heat
for 3 mins or until browned. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the
sausage to a plate. Heat the oil in the Dutch iven, add the beef, in
batches if necessary, and cook for 3 mins or until browned, turning
frequently.

2. Return all the meat, and any juices that have collected, to the
Dutch oven. Stir in the stock, tomato sauce, tomato juice,
Worcestershire, beer, as much chili powder as you dare, the onion and
garlic powders, and 1 tsp of the hot pepper sauce; bring to a boil.
Lower the heat and simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 hours or until the beef
is tender.

3. Stir in the cumin, the remaining 1 tsp of red pepper sauce, and the
salt. Cook, partially, covered, 30 mins longer or until the flavors
are well blended. For each serving, place a heaping spoonful of rice
in a soup plate and ladle chili on top. Makes 10 to 12 servings.
