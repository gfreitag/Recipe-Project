Preparation Time: 1:10 1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Unwrap thawed puff
pastry sheets and cut each sheet into thirds at the fold marks. Place
on 2 ungreased baking sheets; prick all over with a fork. Bake 15
mins. Prick with a fork again and bake 8 to 10 mins longer, or until
pastry is golden brown. Let cool completely on baking sheets. When
cool, cut each piece of pastry crosswise into 6 equal pieces. Split
each piece in half horizontally, keeping tops and bottoms together.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine milk, cold coffee, coffee liqueur,
and pudding mix. Beat with an electric mixer on low until well
combined, 1 min. Fold in whipped cream. Cover and refrigerate 1 1/2
hours.

3. To assemble, place a generous tablespoonful of pudding mixture on
bottom half of each puff pastry piece, then replace top piece of puff
pastry. Drizzle chocolate sauce lightly over each napoleon, then
sprinkle toasted almonds on top. Refrigerate 6 hours before serving.
