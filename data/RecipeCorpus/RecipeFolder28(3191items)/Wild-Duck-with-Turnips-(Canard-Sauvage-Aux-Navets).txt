Rosendale Road London SE21 8LG METRIC/IMPERIAL U.S. 2 young mallard 2
fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 75 ml/5 tbsp sunflower
oil 5 tbsp 2 small apples
2 300 ml/1/2 pint chicken
1 1/4 cups 2 wineglasses white wine 2
stock
wineglasses 700 g/1 1/2 lb turnips 1 1/2 lb 12 medium shallots 12 25
1 1/2 tbsp 15 ml/1
1 tbsp red currant
ml/1 1/2 tbsp icing (confectioners') sugar
tbsp white wine vinegar
jelly, optional mustard and cress, to garnish This is a recipe given
by a dear friend from the Jura region of France. She has often cooked
it for us, using Barbary duck- but we have varied it with mallard and
found it worked well. Be sure you buy young birds and use very small
round turnips. The flavour of large old turnips is too strong and
will overwhelm the dish. Preheat the oven to 230-C/450-F/Mark 8.
Season the cavities of the birds with salt and pepper and brown them
in 30 ml/2 tbsp of oil. Put an apple inside each duck, and tuck in
the tail ends. Place them in a roasting pan and pour in the stock and
white wine. Roast for 20-30 minutes, basting frequently. Meanwhile,
blanch the turnips in a little boiling water. Drain and reserve.
Blanch the shallots, drain and reserve. Heat the remaining oil in a
small pan and add the sugar and turnips. Cook over a medium heat
until the turnips start to brown and caramelise. This should take
10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the turnips. Add the shallots
and continue cooking until both vegetables are browned and tender.
Sprinkle with the vinegar - in a few minutes it will vapourise - then
remove from the heat and keep warm. When the ducks are cooked, remove
from the roasting pan and place on a hot serving dish. Surround with
the vegetables and keep hot. Reduce the stock in the roasting pan a
little, taste and adjust seasoning and, if desired, add some
redcurrant jelly. Sprinkle the ducks with mustard and cress and
serve, with the sauce separately.
