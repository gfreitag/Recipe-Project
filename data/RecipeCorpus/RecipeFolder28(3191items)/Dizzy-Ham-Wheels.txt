Title: Dizzy Ham Wheels
Categories: Sandwich, Kids
Yield: 4 servings
Milk
Sesame seeds or poppy seeds
1 cn Crescent Rolls (8 rolls)
4 sl Boiled ham
8 sl American or cheddar cheese
Preheat oven to temperature called for on roll package. Separate
rolls into four squares.  Press the perforated diagonal together to
remove. Place squares on ungreased baking sheet. Cut ham and cheese
into 1 1/2" squares. Top each square of dough with a slice of cheese,
then a slice of ham, then another slice of cheese. With each square
of dough, make a cut from each of the four corners toward the center.
Stop 1/2" from the center. With each square of dough, fold
alternating points to center. Overlap each point of dough over the
last one and pinch to seal.  Fasten with a toothpick. (Will look like
a pinwheel)  Brush each wheel with a little milk and sprinkle with
sesame or poppy seeds. Bake according to directions on roll package.
