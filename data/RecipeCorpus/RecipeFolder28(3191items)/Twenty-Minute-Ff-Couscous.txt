Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea Bunch green onions
1 ea Bunch spinach
1 ea Garlic to taste
1 ea Herbs (rosemary, oregano,
Bay leaves)
1 sm Pinch cayenne pepper
2 T  Whole wheat flour
1 ea Couscous prepared per
Pk (1*1/2C*water to 1c
Couscous)
1/2 c  Cooking sherry
1    Onion, chopped
2 c  Chopped broccoli &/or
Cauliflour
1 ea Bell pepper, chopped
Place a large skillit over medium heat.  Pour about 1/2-3/4 c of
cooking sherry in.  Chop up 1 onion and add.  Stir occasionally.  Add
a couple cups of chopped broccolli and/or califlour.  Continue to
saute.  Add a chopped bell pepper. Add a bunch of gree onions.
Spinich, , etc. can be added at this point.  Add as much garlic as
you can stand.  I usually use 3 or 4 cloves.  Add Rosemay, Oregano,
Bay leaves, and small pinch of cayanne. Suate all of this until done.
Usually just a few minutes.

Add water to cous cous, stir well, and leave covered.

Remove most of the vegetable from the skillit, leaving as much liquid
as possible, and some of the vegetables.  Add 2 cups of room
temperature water to the remaining liquid.  Mix two tablespoons of
whole wheat flour in 1/2 cup of room temperature water until
completely dissolved.  Any lumps will prove disaterous.  When the
water in the skillit boils, and the water/whole wheat mixture.  Stir
until the gravy thickens.

To serve put cous cous on each plate, top with vegetable, and gray.
From the beggining of preperation to serving has never taken me more
than half an hour. Love, Luck and Lolipops Ralph
