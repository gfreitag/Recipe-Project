Title: Asian Vegetable, Mizuna, with Oven Roasted Root Vegetable
Categories: Vegetables, Asian, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Cayenne
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Onion powder
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground Cumin
1 1/2 ts Sweet paprika
1 bn Mizuna or shui cai, washed
-drained and cut into 3"
-lengths
6 md Potatoes, peeled and cut
-into 1 1/2" chunks
4 md Carrots. peeled and cut into
-1 1/2" lengths
1 sm Rutabega, peeled and cut
-into 1 1/2" chunks
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
1/2 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts White pepper
Mix dry seasonings together and add oil. Mix thoroughly. Peel and cut
root vegetables. Parboil until just beginning to soften. Drain. Then
pour oil/seasoning mix over over the root vegies and turn till well
coated. Place these vegies on a large cookie pan (with sides.) Roast
in a 350 degree oven till tender and starting to brown.

Place the greens in a large bowl and pour the root vegies over them,
tossing well, till they just start going limp, serve immediately. The
reason that you don't cook these greens, other than to wilt them with
the hot root vegetables is that they cook much too quickly and they
wouldn't be near as good.
