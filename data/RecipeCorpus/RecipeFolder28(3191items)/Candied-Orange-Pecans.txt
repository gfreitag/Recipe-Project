Title: Candied Orange Pecans
Categories: Question?
Yield: 1 batch
Grated rind of 1 lg orange
1 1/2 oz Butter
12 oz Light brown sugar
8 oz Orange juice
8 oz Pecan halves
Oil a marble slab or baking sheet.  Put the sugar and juice in a
saucepan and stir over a low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Bring
to the boil and keep boiling until the syrup has reached the soft
ball stage (236F on a sugar thermometer).  When it begins to thicken
and reduce test a few drops in a cup of cold water.  When they form
soft balls take off the heat and immediately add the grated rind and
butter. Beat with a wooden spoon until the mixture is beginning to
stiffen. Quickly add the pecans and continue stirring until they look
slightly sugary. Turn out onto the oiled surface and separate the
nuts, using two forks or your fingers. Dry on a rack. They will keep
well in glass jars or in boxes.

The authors mention that this recipe is from Jean Hewitt's New York
Times Heritage Cookbook.  If pecans aren't available then walnuts
will do in a pinch.
