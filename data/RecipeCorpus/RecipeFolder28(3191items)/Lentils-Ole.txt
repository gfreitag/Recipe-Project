In a large saucepan, bring the water and the lentils to a boil.
Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pan, and simmer the lentils
for 25-30 minutes or until the lentils are tender but not mushy.  Do
not overcook the lentils

While the lentils cook, in a medium-sized skillet, preferably one
with a nonstick surface, heat the oil, add the garlic, scallions,
green pepper, cumin, and chili powder, and saute the ingredients for
2 minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp.

Stir in the tomato sauce, vinegar, and molasses, and simmer the
mixture for 1 minute.

When the lentils are cooked, add the vegetable mixture to the
lentils, and heat the mixture through before serving it.

NOTES:  Serve with cooked rice or corn.
