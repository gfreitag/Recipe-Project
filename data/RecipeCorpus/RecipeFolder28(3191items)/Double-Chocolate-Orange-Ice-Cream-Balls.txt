Preparation Time: 0:20 1. Let ice cream stand until slightly softened
but not melted, 5 to 10 mins. In a medium bowl, mix together ice
cream, candied orange peel, and Grand Marnier. Using an ice cream
scoop, quickly shape mixture into 6 balls. Place in a covered freezer
container and freeze until hard, 6 hours or overnight.

2. Place chopped chocolate on a sheet of wax paper or in a shallow
dish. On at a time, remove balls from freezer and quickly roll in
chocolate to coat completely. Press chocolate into ice cream. Return
to freezer immediately and keep frozen for up to 10 days before
serving.
