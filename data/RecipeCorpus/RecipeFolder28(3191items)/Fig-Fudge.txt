Title: Fig Fudge
Categories: Candies, Fruit
Yield: 1 batch
Grated rind of 1 lemon
1/2 lb Granulated sugar
4    -fluid ounces water
1/2 lb Dried figs
1/2 lb Ground almonds
2 oz Cocoa powder
1 ts Cinnamon
Mince the figs finely or put them through a food processor.  Assemble
all the rest of the dry ingredients, except for the sugar, in a
mixing bowl. Combine the sugar and water in a heavy saucepan.  Bring
to the boil, stirring only until the sugar is dissolved.  Then boil
without stirring for a minute or two, *just* until it has thickened
and is slightly reduced. Remove from the heat and beat in the
remaining ingredients. The mixture will be very stiff.  Return to the
heat and cook gently until it is slightly shiny and comes away from
the sides and bottom of the pan in a mass.  This only takes a few
minutes. Pat into an 8-inch cake tin or shallow dish.  Allow it to
cool, then cut into small squares and sprinkle with granulated sugar.

The authors mention that this recipe comes from Ursula Bourne's
Portuguese Cookery and in her book it is called Morgado de figos do
Algarve. They note that this is an easy recipe to make and it keeps
well.
