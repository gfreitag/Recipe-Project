Sift flour, 1/4 cup sugar, cinnamon and salt together; cut in
shortening. Stir in eggs. Blend in vinegar and cold water, 1 Tbs at a
time. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth, about
5 to 8 mins. Wrap in waxed paper; chill for 30 mins. Roll dough out
1/8 inch thick. Cut into 6 x 4-inch ovals. Fold 6-inch lengths of
heavy-duty aluminum foil in thirds and roll to 1-inch diameters. Wrap
dough ovals loosely around foil. Seal edges of dough by brushing with
egg white and pressing together. Fry in deep hot fat until golden
brown. Drain on paper towels. Cool slightly; remove foil. Cool
completely; store in airtight container until ready to serve. Combine
cheese, remaining 1 1/4 cups sugar, vanilla, and cocoa; beat with
mixer or blend in blender until smooth. Add 1/2 cup chopped pecans.
Chill. Fill crispy cylinders of fried pastries with cheese mixture.
Dip ends in chopped pecans; dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve
immediately. Yield: 16-18 cannoli.
