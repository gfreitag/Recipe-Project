Alex Patout describes Crawfish as "a delicacy made for sharing-- in
fact, in Cajun country, boiling crawfish for only two people counts
as a venial sin." Wash the crawfish well and pick out any fish bones
or other debris. Fill a great big (40-quart) Stockpot a quarter full
of water. Add the salt and peppers and bring to boil. Add the whole
onions, the corn, and the new potatoes (it will be easy to remove
them later if you put them in a cloth sack).  Return to boil, cover,
lower heat to medium, and let cook for 8 minutes.  Add crawfish,
cover again and raise heat to high. After steam begins to escape from
under the lid, cook 7 minutes more. Remove from heat and let sit for
4 minutes. Do *NOT* remove the lid until this point! Remove the
onions, corn, and potatoes to a bowl and drain the crawfish. Place
the crawfish in a large insulated container (an ce chest works well,
as do the thick waterproof boxes chickens are shipped in, which your
butcher may give you for free).  Have your *SPRINKLE* ready and
sprinkle over the crawfish and mix them well to coat. Cover and let
sit for 7 minutes. Serve immediately with the onions, corn, new
potatoes, and lots of French bread on a large table covered with
plenty of paper. When everyone has eaten his fill, everyone "peels
for the house."  The peeled tails can then be used in cold crawfish
cocktail or salad or for Fried Crawfish the next day. Serves 8-10
NOTE:  Most of the salt is not added until after the cooking process
because too much salt added during cooking makes the flesh of the
crawfish adhere to the shell. From Alex Patout's "Cajun Home Cooking"
