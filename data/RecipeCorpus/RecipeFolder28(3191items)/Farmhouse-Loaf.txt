plain or golden 4 oz Butter 6 oz Golden syrup ** 1 x  Large egg,

Lyons' Golden Syrup, carried in some fancy groceries. If you can't
find it, use Karo golden corn syrup. Sift the flour with the soda and
baking powder, and the mixed spice and ginger: then add the brown
sugar, chopped peel and raisins:  mix.  Make a well in the center.
Melt the butter with the syrup over low heat, then pour into the well
in the mixture. Add the beaten egg and milk and mix very well. Pour
into a greased 2-lb loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven at 325 F
for 40-50 minutes, or until it tests done.  This bread will keep
moist for several days, and actually improves somewhat during this
period. From Diane Duane
