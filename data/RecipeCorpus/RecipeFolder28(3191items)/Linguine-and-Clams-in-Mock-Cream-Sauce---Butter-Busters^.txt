Blend in blender until very smooth, like a cream. Use in any sauce
that calls for cream. do not cook as long in a sauce as you would a
regular cream. When you first add it to your sauce, it will look
grainy and separate. Don't worry, simply stir over the heat for a
moment and it will smooth out beautifully. Saute the garlic in the
liquid Butter Buds. Drain the clams, reserving the juice. Add the
juice to the pan and simmer. Add mock cream, clams, vermouth and
pepper to taste. Toss with the cooked linguine and top with Parmesan
cheese. Per serving: 131 cal., 0.8g fat (5%), 20mg chol., 1g fiber,
