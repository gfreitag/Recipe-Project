Title: Scott's Favorite Chicken Marinade
Categories: Chicken, Marinades, Bbq/grill
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Toasted sesame oil
(the dark brown stuff)
Chicken legs and/or
-- thighs; skinless
1    Whole head of garlic
Recipe by: Scott Hartman I made this for a fancy dinner some years
ago. It's great.

Peel the garlic and chop it fine. You can do this in a food
processor, but don't let it process until it's a paste. You want tiny
bits.

Mix the garlic with the sesame oil and marinate skinless chicken
thighs overnight, or at least four hours. Cook over a very high heat.
Since there is no sugar in this, it won't burn. Turn the chicken
frequently. It should get brown and crusty, but not burned.

Chop some fresh ripe tomatos and mix with some chopped cilantro. When
the chicken is done, serve it very hot with the tomato/cilantro stuff
on top.

This looks beautiful, and is a symphony of contrasts. The sesame oil
and garlic with the juicy thigh meat, and the hot chicken with the
cold tomato is great.

Uncork a white zinfandel, beer, or a big glass of water with the
juice of a lime and enjoy it. Serve basmati rice cooked with chicken
or beef stock and a couple of drops of orange oil (or a tablespoon of
orange rind) and some simple green vegetable.
