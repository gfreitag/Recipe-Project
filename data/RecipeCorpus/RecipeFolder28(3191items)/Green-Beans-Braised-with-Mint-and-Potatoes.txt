Title: Green Beans Braised with Mint and Potatoes
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Chopped fresh parsley, opt.
2 md Potatoes; peeled
Salt & freshly ground pepper
Chopped fresh mint
3 tb Olive oil & margarine, mixed
1 c  Tomato juice or sauce
1 lb Fresh green beans
- trimmed, cut
Heat the fat in an enameled pan and mix in the tomato juice or sauce.
Add the green beans and parsley to the pan with enough water to
almost cover. Tuck the potato slices in between, partially cover the
pan, and simmer for 25 minutes, the stir and season with salt,
pepper, and 2 tablespoons chopped mint.  Cook uncovered until the
beans and potatoes are fork tender, about 10 more minutes.  If the
sauce has not thickened, pour it into a small pan, and boil down to
one cup, then combine with the beans and potatoes in a warm serving
bowl. Sprinkle with a little additional fresh mint and serve warm.
Excellent with grilled chops, fish or egg dish, but equally good as a
main course with cheese.
