measure. Let stand till bubbly, about 10 minutes.

2. combine 2 cups of the flour, salt, lemon rind and the remaining
sugar in large bowl; make a well in middle. Beat the eggs and egg
yolks in a small bowl just to mix. Pour eggs, yest mixture and warm
milk into well. Stir liquids into flour until smooth. Beat well.

3. gradually add softened butter, beating well. Stir in 1 more cup of
the flour. Beat until the dough leaves side of bowl.

4. Turn onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic,
about 10 minutes, adding more flour.

5. Place dough in buttered bowl, turning to bring buttered side up;
cover. Let rise in warm, draft free place, 1 1/2 to 2 hours until
double in volume.

6. While the dough is rising, make cheese filling. Beat cream cheese
and cottage cheese in small bowl with electric mixer until smooth;
beat in egg yolk and sugar. Stir in the grated lemon rind.

7. Make crumb topping; combine nuts, flour, butter, sugar and
cinnamon in small bowl. Grease 2-8 x 1 1/2" layer pans.

8. When the dough has doubled, punch down; knead in raisins; divide
dough into 4 equal parts; press 2 parts into the bottom and about
1/2" up the sides of each of the layer pans. Spread each with about 1
cup of the cheese filling.

9. Shape remaining dough into 8" circles; place on top of the cheese
filling. Press spoon handle into dough around the sides to seal.

warm place until dough reaches top of the pans, about 1 hour. Preheat
oven to 350 degrees F.
