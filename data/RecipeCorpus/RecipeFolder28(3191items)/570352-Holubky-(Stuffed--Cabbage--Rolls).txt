Title: 570352 Holubky (Stuffed  Cabbage  Rolls)
Categories: Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Chopped green pepper
1/2 c  Chopped onion
-Salt and pepper to taste
1 lg Jar spaghetti sauce,
-diluted
1 lb Ground beef
1/2 lb Ground pork or veal
-(optional)
1/2 c  Rice, partly cooked
1    Egg
1    Head cabbage
Buy a medium head of cabbage that is not firm.  Remove core and cook
cabbage in boiling salted water until leaves are soft but not ripping.
Remove leaves from cabbage as they get done and cool. Trim down the
thick ridge on the back of the leaves to make it easier to roll. Cook
rice for about 10 minutes in salted water. Combine onion, meat, egg,
rice, pepper and salt and pepper.  Mix well. Spread each leaf with
meat mix, fold the 2 opposite sides and roll. Push or tuck ends in
with thumbs. Place in greased casserole, crease side down.  Dilute
spaghetti sauce to desired thickness and pour over rolls.  Rolls
should almost be covered with sauce. Lay any extra leaves over the
rolls in dish. This prevents the tops from getting burned.  Bake
uncovered at about 325 degrees for 2 hours or until browned and
tender. Submitted By BARRY WEINSTEIN   On   02-26-95
