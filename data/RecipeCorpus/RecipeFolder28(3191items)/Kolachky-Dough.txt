Dough #1 Mix flour and shortening as for pie crust. Make a hole in
center of mixture and add egg yolks, milk, yeast, and vanilla. Mix
until smooth and dough leaves sides of bowl. Form into large balls,
each just large enough to roll out at one time. Cover with wax paper
and refrigerate overnight. Roll out each ball about 1/4" thick on a
board covered with powdered sugar. Cut dough into 2" or 3" squares
and place 1 teaspoon of any desired filling in center of dough; fold
dough over to opposite side and pinch together or roll into horn
shape. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake in 350 oven until
lightly brown, about 12 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with powdered sugar
before serving.
