1 1/4 lb.  green beans 12-16 garlic cloves 6-9 fresh hot green or red
chilies (use 2, seeded) 5 tbsp. vegetable oil 10 oz. lean pork,
ground 1/2 tsp.  paprika 1 tsp. dark brown sugar 3 tbsp. fish sauce

Wash and trim the beans. Cut them crosswise into 1/4 - 1/3 inch
rounds. Peel the garlic and chop it finely. Cut the chilies crosswise
into very thin slices.

Put the oil in a wok and set it over a medium-high heat. When the oil
is hot, put in the garlic and green chilies. Stir and fry until the
garlic turns golden, then add the pork. Stir and fry, breaking up any
lumps, until the pork has lost its raw look. Put in the beans,
paprika, sugar, fish sauce, and 1 1/4 cups water. Stir and cook on a
medium-high heat for about 8-10 minutes, or until the beans are
tender and most of the water has been absorbed.
