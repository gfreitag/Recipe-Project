Judging when seafood is cooked just right is easier than most people
think. As fish cooks, it turns from translucent to opaque. Don't be
afraid to check by inserting a thin knife into the center or thickest
part just before you think it is It is important to remove it from
heat just before it is done because fish continues to cook off the
heat. A general guideline to follow is cook at 400! or broil for 10
minutes per inch of thickness, measuring the fish at the thickest
part.

Saut onions and peppers in oil in a medium skillet over medium-high
heat for 2-3 minutes or until softened. Whisk together remaining .
ingredients except salmon, salt and pepper. Pour into d skillet with
onion-pep- per mixture and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
Remove from heat and keep warm. Cut center bones and skin from salmon
steaks and cut into 1-inch chunks. Season with salt and pepper. Place
on a greased baking sheet and broil for 3-5 minutes or until fish
just flakes when tested with a for k. Serve salmon nuggets with a
bowl of sweet and sour sauce for dipping. Makes 4-6 servings.

ADULT VARIATION: Leave salmon steaks whole. Place on a greased baking
sheet and broil for 10 minutes per inch of thickness or until fish
just flakes when tested with a fork. Spoon sweet and sour sauce over
the steak just before From the files of Al Rice, North Pole Alaska.
