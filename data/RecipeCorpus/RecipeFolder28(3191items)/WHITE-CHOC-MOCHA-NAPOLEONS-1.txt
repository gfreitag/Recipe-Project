Make the white chocolate mascarpone cream:
Place the white chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan,
bring
3/4 cup of the cream to a gentle boil. Remove from heat. Pour the
hot
cream over the chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to
melt
the chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth. Whisk in the mascarpone
cheese, vanilla and almond extract. Cover the mixture with
plastic wrap
and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.

Make the mocha mascarpone cream:
Place the chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan bring
3/4 cup
of the cream and the espresso powder to a gentle boil. Pour the
hot
cream over the chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to
melt
the chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth. Whisk in the mascarpone
cheese, coffee liqueur and cinnamon. Cover the mixture with
plastic wrap
and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.

Make the pastry layers:
Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 375
degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper.

Thaw the sheet of puff pastry according to the package
directions. Lay
the sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Using a large chef's
knife,
trim the sheet so that it is a perfect square. Using a fork,
prick the
pastry well all over its surface. Using the knife, cut the sheet
into
four squares . Transfer the squares to the prepared baking sheet.
Place
the baking sheet in the freezer for 10 minutes.

Remove the prepared pastry squares from the freezer. Spray a wire
rack
which is the same size as the baking sheet with nonstick cooking
spray.
Place the rack upside down over the pastry squares. Bake the
squares for
20 to 25 minutes, until golden. Transfer the squares to a wire
rack and
cool completely.
