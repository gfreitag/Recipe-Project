NOTE: Recipe was designed and tested with a 900 watt Microwave. If
yours has less power, you will need to lengthen the cooking time.

BEANS AND MEAT: In a large, heavy pot, combine ground round, onion,
and garlic. Cook over medium heat until browned, stirring frequently
and breaking up meat with spoon. Turn out mixture onto a plate lined
with paper towels. When fat has been absorbed, return mixture to pot.

Add tomatoes, breaking then up with spoon. Add tomato sauce, kidney
beans, chili powder, and pepper. Stir to mix well. Add salt to taste,
if desired. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 45 mins,
stirring occasionally, until flavors are well blended. Skim off and
discard any fat.

POLENTA: (Note, for smooth polenta, follow exactly). While sauce is
cooking, combine cornmeal, sugar, salt, if desired, water, milk,
onion, and green chiles in a 2 1/2- qt microwave-safe casserole. Stir
to mix well. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 8 to 9 mins, stopping
and stirring with a wire whisk after 3 mins and 6 mins. After
cooking, stir again with wire whisk until mixture is smooth. Cover
with casserole lid and microwave an additional 6 to 7 mins on high.
Remove from microwave and let stand an additional 3 to 4 mins.

Serve meat and bean mixture over polenta.
