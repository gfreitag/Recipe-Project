Cook rice according to package directions.

MARINADE AND BEEF: With sharp knife, cut flank steak diagonally into
thin strips, trimming away and discarding all visible fat.

In medium bowl, mix together sherry, soy sauce, five-spice powder,
vinegar, ginger, pepper, and hot oil, if desired. Stir to mix well.
Add cornstarch and stir to incorporate thoroughly. Add beef and stir
to coat well. Set aside 15 to 20 mins, stirring occasionally.

SAUCE AND VEGETABLES: While beef is marinating, remove skins from
tomatoes easily by filling a Dutch oven or large saucepan with about
5 inches of water. Bring to a boil over high heat. When water boils,
add tomatoes and cook 1 min, stirring. Remove tomatoes from boiling
water, and place in colander under cold running water. When tomatoes
are cool enough to handle, pull off skin and discard. Core and chop
tomatoes, and set aside in medium bowl.

Combine sesame oil, onion, and 2 Tbs broth in large, non-stick
skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until onion is
almost tender, 4 to 5 mins. Remove beef from marinade with slotted
spoon and add to skillet. Cook, stirring, until beef is browned,
about 2 to 3 mins. Add remaining marinade to skillet along with
remaining broth. Raise heat and cook, stirring, until mixture has
thickened slightly and boils.

Stir in brown sauce and vinegar. Add tomato pieces, water chestnuts,
green onion, and salt, if desired. Bring to a simmer. Lower heat and
simmer 2 mins or until tomato is slightly cooked. Serve beef mixture
over rice. Garnish with additional chopped green onion tops, if
desired.
