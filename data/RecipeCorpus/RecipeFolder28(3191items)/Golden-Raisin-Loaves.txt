Categories: Breads, Cake/cookie
Yield: 10 servings
2 lg Eggs
1 1/2 c  Raisins; golden
2 1/2 c  Unbleached flour; sifted
Vegetable oil
-----vanilla frosting-----
2 c  Confectioners' sugar
1/4 ts Vanilla
2 1/2 tb Milk
2 c  Whole wheat flour; stirred
1/4 c  Sugar
2 pk Active dry yeast; or
2 tb Active dry yeast; bulk
1 ts Salt
2 ts Cinnamon; ground
3/4 c  Water
1/3 c  Butter or regular margarine
1/2 c  Buttermilk
NOTE:  The amount of flour can vary from 2 1/4 to 2 3/4 cups
depending on consistency.

Stir 1 3/4 cups of the whole wheat flour, sugar, undissolved yeast,
salt and cinnamon together in a large mixing bowl.  Heat the water
and butter in
a saucepan over low heat to very warm (120-130 degrees F.).  Remove
from the heat and stir in the buttermilk.  Add to the flour-yeast
mixture and beat, with an electric mixer on medium speed, until
smooth, about 2 minutes.  Add the eggs and beat an additional 2
minutes, then stir in the raisins.  Gradually add the remaining 1/4
cup of whole wheat flour and enough white flour to make a stiff but
light dough.  (Heaviness indicates too much flour and the bread will
not rise correctly.)  Let rest for 5 minutes.  Turn the dough out
onto a lightly floured surface and knead until
smooth, about 5 to 8 minutes.  Cover with the mixing bowl and let
rest for   30 minutes.  Punch the dough down and divide in half.  Let
rest 10 minutes,   then roll each half to a 12 X 7-inch rectangle.
Beginning at the 7-inch   side, roll up tightly like a jelly roll and
seal the edges.

Tuck the ends under to form rounded edges, (the loaf should be about
7 X 3-inches in size).  Place on a greased baking sheet.  Brush with
oil and repeat for the second batch of dough.  Cover and let rise in
a warm place until almost doubled, about 30 minutes.  Bake in a
preheated 375 degree F.
oven for 25 minutes or until the loaves sound hollow when tapped.
Remove from the baking sheet and cool on wire racks for 20 minutes.
Frost with the vanilla icing if desired.

VANILLA ICING: Combine the sugar, vanilla, and milk in a bowl and
beat until smooth.
