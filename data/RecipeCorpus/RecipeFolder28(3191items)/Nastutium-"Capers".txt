Pick nasturtium seeds just after the blossoms drop and before the seed
dries out. In a glass bowl, dissolve 6 Tbs salt in 1 qt of water. Add
nasturtium seeds and soak overnight. Drain the next day and repeat the
process. On the third day drain then divide the seeds between the two
half-pint jars.

In a saucepan, combine vinegar, 1 tsp salt, dill seed, mustard seed,
peppercorns and garlic; then bring to a boil. Strain liquid over
nasturtium seeds. Cap with new lids and tighten rings. Process in
boiling water bath to cover for 15 mins.

Cool and store in a cool place. (Alternately, after pouring strained
liquid over the seeds, you may cover and store in refrigerator for up
to a month.) Makes 2 cups of "capers"

NOTES : True capers are the unopened flower buds of a spiny
Mediterranean
shrub, Cappris spinosa. Capers are expensive to buy; but
following
this recipe using freshly harvested nasturtium seeds, you can
produce a reasonable but not identical product.
