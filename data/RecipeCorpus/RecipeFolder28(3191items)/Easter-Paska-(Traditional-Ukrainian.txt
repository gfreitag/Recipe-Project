Title: Easter Paska (Traditional Ukrainian
Categories: Desserts, Ussr, Breads
Yield: 3 servings
MMMMM--------------------FROM: JERRY TRETIAK-------------------------
1/2 c  White sugar
1/2 c  Butter (not margarine)
1/2 c  Oil (any good vegetable oil)
1 t  Salt
3 c  Lukewarm water
10 ea - 11 cups   Flour
1/2 c  Water
1 1/2 T  Yeast (not instant)
1 t  Sugar
Combine until yeast is
-dissolved, 10 minutes.
6 ea Eggs, beaten
Combine the softened yeast with beaten eggs, add sugar , butter, oil,
salt and water. Mix in the flour and mix until smooth and elastic.
The dough should be just a little stiffer than for regular bread.
Cover, let rise in a warm place until double in bulk. Punch down and
let rise again. Take dough, make a round base 1" thick and cover the
bottom of a round 9" greased pan. Take 2 equal-sized pieces of dough
(now this is the hard part), roll each into 36" lengths about 1 -
1-1/2" in diameter. Place side by side and starting from centre,
entwine each about the other, do the other half in the same manner,
place the entwined length on the base in a circle along the edge.
Roll 4 equal size pieces of dough each to 10 " length (same
diameter), entwine 2 length on the base to cross each other at the
centre, curl each end. Let rise to almost double in bulk. Be careful
not to let the Paska rise too long as the ornaments will lose their
definition. Brusk lightly with beaten egg. Bake in 325 degree oven
for 15 minutes, then bake 45 minutes at 350 degrees. Makes 3 or 4
Paskas. If you have never seen a Paska before, it may be hard to
understand the ornamentation part of this recipe. I do not really
expect anyone to try making it, I just posted it more for information.
