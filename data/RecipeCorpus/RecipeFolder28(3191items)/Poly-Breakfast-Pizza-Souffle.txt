Recipe by: Cooking With Mickey-Gourmet Mickey Cookbook Vol II

Soak bread slices in milk for 15 mins, then drain off any excess
liquid. Line bottom of a buttered 2 1/2- to 3-qt casserole dish with
bread slices. Top slices with a layer of tomato sauce, sprinkle with
a bit of oregano and add a layer of cheese. Continue making layers,
finishing by covering last layer of bread with just tomato sauce and
oregano. Casserole should be nearly full.

Preheat oven to 350 F.

Beat eggs with Parmesan cheese and pour over casserole. Pierce through
layers in three or four places with a fork until mixture is completely
absorbed by bread. Dot top of casserole with butter and bake for
about 1 hour, or until top is browned and puffed.

YIELD: 2 1/2 cups
TOMATO SAUCE

In a large saute pan, saute onions in olive oil until tender but not
brown. Add all other ingredients and simmer for 30 mins, or until
tomatoes have been reduced to a pulp. Press mixture through a sieve
with a wooden spoon and reduce sauce further if necessary. Add salt
and pepper to taste.
