Title: Anginares a la Polita (Artichokes with Dill Sauce)
Categories: Middle east, Greek, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Onion; finely chopped
1/4 c  Dill, fresh or 1 tablespoon
;dried dill weed
2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Lemon juice, fresh
1/4 c  Flour
1 c  Water
6 md Artichoke
1 c  Olive oil
In a large, deep bowl, beat the lemon juice and flour together with
a whisk or spoon, add the water and beat to a smooth thin paste.  Set
aside.
With a small, sharp knife, trim 1/8 inch off the stem end of each
artichoke and peel the tough outer skin from the remaining stem. Snap
off the small bottom leaves and any bruised or discolored outer
leaves. Lay each artichoke on its side, grip it firmly, and with a
large knife slice about 1 inch off the top.  Spread the top leaves
apart gently and pull out the inner core of thistle like yellow
leaves. With a long handled spoon, scrape out the hair choke inside.
Drop the artichokes into the lemon juice mixture, turning them about
to coat them evenly and let them soak while you make the sauce.
Heat the olive oil over moderate heat in a shallow enameled or
stainless steel casserole large enough to hold the artichokes
comfortably. Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes, or until they are
soft and transparent but not brown.  Drain the artichoke soaking
liquid into the casserole, add the dill and salt and, stirring
constantly, bring to a boil over high heat.
Lay  the artichokes side by side in the sauce and baste them
thoroughly. Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly, and simmer for 20
minutes. Then turn the artichokes over and, basting occasionally,
simmer 25 minutes longer, or until their bases show no resistance
when pierced with the pint of a small knife.  Remove from the heat
and let the artichokes cool to room temperature.  To serve, arrange
on a platter and spoon the sauce over them.
