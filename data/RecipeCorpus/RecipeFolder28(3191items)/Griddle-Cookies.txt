Title: Griddle Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Shortning
1 ea Egg
1/2 c  Milk
1 1/4 c  Raisins (opt)
1 ts Ground nutmeg
3 1/2 c  Flour
1 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Baking Powder
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking soda
Sift dry ingredients together. Cut in shortening until mixture is
mealy. Beat Egg. Add Milk and blend milk and Egg. Stir egg/milk into
dry (with shortening) Roll out on a floured board to 1/4 inch thick.
Cut with a cookie cutter.  Grill on a hot grill on both sides (just
like pancakes) NOTE: this is also good if you do all of the above up
to grilling them and then freeze them. Then when you want one or 4 or
20 ;-) cookies, just take that many out of the freezer and grill them
right up. (or eat them raw, whatever tickles your fancy. ;-) Enjoy.
