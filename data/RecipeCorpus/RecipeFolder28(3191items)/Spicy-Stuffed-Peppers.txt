1/4 c  Raisins; chopped
10 sm Green olives with pimiento
1 ts Dried oregano
1/2 ts Instant beef bouillon
2 c  Cooked long-grain rice
-- (white or brown)
Parsley sprigs; for garnish

"Be sure to get flawless, well-shaped peppers that will stand upright
in a baking dish to make this one-dish meal decorative, as well as
delicious."

With a paring knife, slice "lids" from peppers and set aside.
Carefully remove seeds and membranes, rinse with cold water and place
peppers in baking dish.  Set aside.

In large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat; add onion, beef and
walnuts and cook until beef is browned and onion is golden.  Add chili
powder and cumin and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.  Stir
in tomato sauce, raisins, olives, oregano, instant bouillon and 1/2
cup water. Simmer 5 minutes; remove from heat; and stir in rice.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Spoon 1/4 rice mixture into each
pepper and cover with reserved "lids".  Pour 1/2 cup of water into
baking dish; cover tightly with foil and bake 50-60 minutes until
peppers can be pierced easily with a knife. Using a slotted spoon,
remove peppers to a platter, garnish with parsley sprigs for "stems"
if desired, and serve.
