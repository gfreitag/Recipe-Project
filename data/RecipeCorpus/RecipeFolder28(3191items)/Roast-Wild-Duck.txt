2
of parsley 25 g/1 oz butter/vegetable margarine
tbsp 1 wineglass red wine 1 wineglass 30 ml/2 tbsp sunflower oil 2
8 - 10 slices
tbsp 6-8 rashers streaky (fatty) bacon
orange juice, optional flour for dredging Preheat the oven to
230-C/450-F/Mark 8. Season the cavities of the birds with salt and
pepper, and place an onion, 1/2 bunch of parsley and a nut of butter
inside each bird. Tuck in the tail ends. Pour the wine and oil into a
roasting pan and place the birds in it. Cover the breasts with the
bacon. Roast for about 20 minutes (rare) or 25-30 minutes (fairly
well done). Remember to baste the birds well several times. Some
orange juice may be added to the pan to help baste the birds. About 5
minutes before they are ready, remove the bacon, baste the breasts
well and dredge with flour. Baste again, then return to the oven and
roast until the breasts of the birds are golden brown.
