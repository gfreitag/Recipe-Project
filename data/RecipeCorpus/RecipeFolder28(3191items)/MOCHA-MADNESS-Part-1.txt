Make the chocolate ice cream:
Put the chocolate into a medium bowl.
In a medium bowl, using a wire whisk, stir the yolks, sugar and
salt
until blended.
In a heavy medium saucepan, bring the cream and milk to a gentle
boil.
Remove the pan from the heat. Gradually whisk about 1 cup of the
hot
cream mixture into the beaten egg yolks until blended. Return this
mixture to the saucepan.

Continue cooking over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a
wooden
spoon, for 3 to 5 minutes, until the custard has thickened
slightly. Do
not allow the custard to boil. It is done when you can run your
finger
down the back of the coated spoon and the path remains in the
custard.
Immediately remove the pan from the heat, and pour the custard
over the
chocolate. Let stand for 30 seconds and then whisk until smooth.
Strain
the chocolate custard through a fine-meshed strainer into a
stainless
steel bowl. Place the bowl over a larger bowl of ice water and
stir the
custard for 5 to 10 minutes, or until cool. Remove the bowl from
the ice
water and stir in the vanilla. Cover the surface of the custard
with
plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours, or until very cold.
