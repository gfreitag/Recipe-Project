Categories: Meats, Main dish

1    Pepper
1/8 ts Oregano
1 c  Red wine
1 cn Tomatoes
1 tb Lard
1    Onion, chopped
1/8 lb Salt pork, chopped
1    Garlic clove, chopped
2 lb Stew beef
Cut beef into small pieces. Place lard, chopped onion, salt pork, and
garlic in a stew pot and brown slightly; add meat, salt, pepper, and
oregano and let meat brown slowly. When meat is well browned, pour
the wine over it and continue cooking until wine is absorbed. Add
tomatoes and enough  hot water to cover the meat. Cover the pan and
cook for about 2 hours until meat is very tender. If gravy is too
thick, add a little water. The gravy will be dark and very tasty.
Serve with polenta or Whipped Potatoes. ------- from The Talisman
