Small berries work best for this recipe. Choose berries that are
nicely shaped and red all over but not over-ripe. Wash, remove stems
and measure to make sure you have a full quart of usable berries.

Put the berries in a jar or crock with a tight cover. Mix the brandy
and sugar together and warm over low heat, stir until sugar is
dissolved and then stir into berries. (Stir carefully so that berries
are not cut or bruised.) Cover tightly and put them where you will
see them often enough to remind yourself to stir them from time to
time (about 2 or 3 times a week).

Let the berries marinate in the brandy sauce through the summer. They
will give up some of their liquid and become smaller and paler in
color while they are marinating. They are ready to eat in about 3
months and keep for about a year (after that they begin to lose their
flavor, but are still safe to eat).

BRANDIED FRESH PINEAPPLE:

Fresh pineapple can also be made into a brandied dessert sauce this
way. Use 1 cup sugar for 2 cups of chunks of fresh (peeled and eyes
removed) pineapple. Mix a 1/2 cup of brandy with each cup of sugar
and proceed as indicated for strawberries. Brandied pineapple is
particularly good with citrus sherbet or over poached winter pears.
