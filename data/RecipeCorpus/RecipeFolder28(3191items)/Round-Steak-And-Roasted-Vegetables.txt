Preheat oven to 350 F.

In large, shallow roasting pan, spread out pieces of meat so they are
separated fromone another. Roast 10 to 15 mins, stirring once or
twice, until meat is browned on all sides.

Remove pan from oven. Add broth, along with oil, onions, potatoes,
carrots, and garlic. Stir to mix. Sprinkle with thyme, salt, if
desired, and pepper. Stir to coat. Return to oven, and roast an
additional 45 mins, stirring occasionally.

If vegetables and meat seem dry, add a bit of bouillon. Stir in
zucchini and roast an additional 10 to 20 mins, stirring once, until
potatoes are tender and have begun to brown.
