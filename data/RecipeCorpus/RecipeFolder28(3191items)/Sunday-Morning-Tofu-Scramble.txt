Title: Sunday Morning Tofu Scramble
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
Chopped
x  Several mushrooms, sliced
1 sm Zuchinni
1/2 c  Salsa
8    To 12 ounces firm low fat
Tofu
1 md Cold baked potato, cubed,
Not peeled
1 sm Onion or several scallions,
brown the cubed potato in a dry non-stick skillet add onions,
mushrooms and zuchinni cook until veggies are done. Crumble tofu with
a fork, add to the skillet and heat thoroughly Season with salsa, add
peppers if you like it spicey, I like the pickled jalapeno slices.

Serve as is or wrap in a tortilla for a breakfast burrito.

I actually usually double this recipe, the leftovers reheat nicely.
Of course, you can change the seasonings as you like.  How about
using peas instead of zuchinni and season with curry?  Sometimes I
add veggie saugase or seasoned seitan.  Use your imagination.
