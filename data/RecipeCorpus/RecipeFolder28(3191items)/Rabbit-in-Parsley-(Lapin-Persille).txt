Cut the rabbit into joints and soak it for about 12 hours in salted
water. Drain, rinse and pat dry. Put the rabbit, wine, chicken stock,
two of the shallots and the carrots cut in half, the bay leaf and
peppercorns into a saucepan, cover and simmer gently for about 45
minutes to 1 hour or until tender. Allow to cool. Strip the meat from
the bones and cut it into 1 cm/1/2 inch pieces. Strain the stock;
reserve the liquid and the carrots. Cut the bacon into fine strips
about 2.5 cm/1 inch long and poach gently for a few minutes in some
of the stock together with the remaining shallots, sliced thickly.
Remove and reserve. Chop the parsley, and garlic and mix together in
a bowl. Add the rabbit with the bacon strips, sliced shallots, half
of the carrots cut into thin rings, and salt and pepper to taste.
Boil the stock to reduce to about 600 ml/1 pint (2 1/2 cups). Cool
slightly then put a little stock into a cup. Sprinkle the gelatine
over and stir very briskly until thoroughly dissolved. Add the
gelatine mixture to the remaining stock and mix well, then stir in
the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. The stock should have a
good strong flavour. Put the rabbit mixture in a 1.2 litre/2 pints (5
cups) capacity glass bowl or souffle dish and pour the stock gently
over. Garnish the top with the remaining carrot and lemon slices.
Chill until set. This dish is best served from the bowl.
