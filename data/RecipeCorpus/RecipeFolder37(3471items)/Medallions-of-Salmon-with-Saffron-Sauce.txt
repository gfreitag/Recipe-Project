Categories: Fish/seafoo, Main dish, Guestchefs
Yield: 6 servings
2 ea To 3 leeks
600 ea Tasmanian salmon fillet,
-skin and bones removed
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
Generous pinch of saffron
-strands
90 ea Cream
1 ts Lemon juice
2 tb Finely chopped chives
Salmon roe
50 ea Eschalots chopped finely
1 sm Clove garlic chopped finely
60 ea Butter
40 ea Vermouth
60 ea Dry white wine
1 l  Hot fish stock
Halve the salmon fillet lengthwise and set aside.  Trim the leeks,
discarding the tough outer leaves.  Slice in halves lengthwise and
wash very thoroughly under cold running water.  Blanch in boiling
water until softened.  Drain and refresh with cold water.  Drain
again to remove excess water.  Select leek strips of approximately
the same size, discarding any that are too large or broken in
pieces.  Spread out a sheet of foil large enough to cover one salmon
half and place the strips of leek vertically on top, overlapping
their edges slightly and matching them to the length of the salmon
piece.  Place the salmon across the bed of leeks and roll up in the
foil to form a sausage shape, sealing the ends.  Repeat with the
other slice of salmon.  Bake in a preheated 100'C oven for 20
minutes.
To make the sauce: cook the chopped eschalots and garlic in half the
butter over low heat until the eschalots are soft and transparent.
Add the vermouth and wine, and cook over low heat until completely
reduced.  Add the fish stock and saffron, cook until reduced to
one-third.  Add the cream and cook for a further 5 minutes, then
strain, add the lemon juice and chives and whisk in the remaining
butter.
To serve: slice each salmon piece across into 6 medallions.  Place
two medallions on each plate, ladle some sauce around and sprinkle
with a little salmon roe.
