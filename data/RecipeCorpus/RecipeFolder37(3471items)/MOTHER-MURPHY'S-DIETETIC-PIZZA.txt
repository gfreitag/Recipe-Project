Title: MOTHER MURPHY'S DIETETIC PIZZA
Categories: Breads, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
-stems and pieces
-small can
1 cn Black olives
2 lb Mozzerella
1 lb Cheddar
1 pk "Jiffy" pizza crust mix
1 cn Can Hunt's Classic Italian
-Spaghetti Sauce with
-Garlic & Herb 27 oz
Gallo dry salami
1 cn Sliced mushrooms
It takes about 1/3 to 1/2 the can of sauce, and maybe half the
mozzerella.
Make the pizza crust as directed on the box.  While it is standing
for the 5 minutes, grate the mozzerella, about 1/4 the cheddar, and
grease the pan. (I use a cookie sheet, which the $.45 crust just
covers.) Spread the crust, pour on the sauce, spread the sauce with a
handy fork. Dump the cheese on and spread it around. The cheddar adds
just a bit of flavor, while the mozzerella takes care of the texture.
Frankly, I like provolone better, but it's just not traditional.
Place the salami close together and overlapping.  Sprinkle mushrooms
over the top, and break olives in two. Use the whole can - to heck
with the diet!
