Categories: Breadmaker
Yield: 1 loaf
4 tb Butter; or margerine
2 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Instant potato flakes
1 1/2 ts Red Star yeast
1 1/8 c  Water
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  Bread flour

Place all ingredients in bread pan, select LightCrust setting, and
press start.
After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake
rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.
Book's Note:  We think this is the best of our whole wheat breads.
It's moist, has a good crust, and a flavor that's out of this world.
