Title: Pumpkin Pie From Fresh Pumpkin
Categories: Holiday, Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
See below
I've found the best way is to cut the pumpkin in half, scoop out the
seeds & such, then put the halves (with the good part) in a pyrex
dish with about an inch of water, facing up, in the oven for about an
hour at 350 degress.  Let cool a while...  You'll be amazed how
easily it will scoop right out, ready to use!
