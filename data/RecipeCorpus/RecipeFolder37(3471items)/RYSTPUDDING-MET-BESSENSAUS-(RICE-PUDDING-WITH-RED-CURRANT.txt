1/2 c  White sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 ts Orange rind, finely grated

Rice plays a big part in Dutch cooking and this comforting pudding
with a hint of orange is wonderful with fresh red currant sauce.  You
can also serve it with just a sprinkle of sugar on top and your
favourite fresh berries on the side.

In a large saucepan, bring milk and rice to boil, stirring
occasionally; reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.

Strain rice, reserving milk, meahwhile, in a bowl, beat eggs;
gradually whisk in milk.  Stir in rice, sugar, vanilla and orange
rind.  Spoon into 8 greased 3/4 cup custard cups.  Place cups in a
large cake pan or roaster; pour in enough hot water to come half way
up sides.  Bake in 325-F oven for 55 to 60 minutes or til set.  Let
cool slightly.  Run a knife around edge of each custard; invert onto
serving plate.  Serve warm or cold with sauce.

Red Currant Sauce: In saucepan, bring currants and 1/3 cup water to a
boil. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer, covered for 5 minutes or
til currants are softened.
Using a food mill or sieve, press out seeds.  Return currant puree to
saucepan along with 2/3 cup water and sugar; simmer over low heat for
10 minutes or til mixture slightly thickens.  Makes 2 cups.
