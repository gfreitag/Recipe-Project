Mrs. Stahl's Potato Cocktail Knishes

1. Put the flour, baking powder, and salt in the bowl of a heavy-duty
mixer equipped with a dough hook. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, the
eggs, and 2 tablespoons of water, Knead for 3 to 4 minutes, add the
remaining oil and as much water as needed to make a smooth dough.  Or
mix the ingredients in a bowl with a wooden spoon and knead the dough
on a floured surface for 6 minutes.

2. Put the dough in an oiled bowl, turn it to oil it all over, and
cover it with plastic wrap, let it stand for 1 hour.  Preheat the
oven to 350 degrees F.

3. Heat the fat or oil in a medium skillet and saute the onions until
they are just tender. Mix them thoroughly into the mashed potatoes
and add salt and pepper to taste.

4. Divide the dough in thirds. On a floured surface, roll one piece
into a thin rectangle about 10 inches long. Place about 2/3 cup of
the potato filling along the long end, about 1 inch from the edge.
Roll up dough like a jelly roll and pinch the edges closed.  Repeat
twice, with the remaining dough and filling.

5. Arrange the long rolls on a baking sheet, and bake them for about
40 minutes, until browned. Slice and serve.

(Unbaked or baked knishes can be frozen, and baked or reheated.  Do
not defrost. Unbaked knishes take about 45 minutes, baked 15 to 20
minutes.) Makes about 2 dozen 1 1/4-inch slices
