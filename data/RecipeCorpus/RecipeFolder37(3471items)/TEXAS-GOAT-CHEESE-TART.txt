This trendy tart comes from the Mozzarella Company in Dallas,
purveyors of prize-winning Texas cheeses that often are flavored with
herbs.  It makes a fine brunch fare accompanied by salad, and
minature tarts are a tremedous hit served as hors d'oeuvres.

DIRECTIONS: =========== Bring all ingredients to room temperature.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a bowl of food processor, mince
herbs and garlic. Add cheeses, butter, creme fraiche, eggs, salt, and
pepper, and process until mixture is smooth. Pour into prebaked pie
crust. Bake until puffed and golden, about 30 minutes. Serve warm or
at room temperature. Serves 8 as first course, 6 for luncheon.

AUTHOR'S NOTE: My favorite combination of herbs for this recipe is 1/4
generous cup parsley, 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, and 2 tablespoons
fresh basil.  Often, I also add more garlic, 3 ounces of sun-dried
tomatoes, and a generous sprinkling of toasted pine nuts.
