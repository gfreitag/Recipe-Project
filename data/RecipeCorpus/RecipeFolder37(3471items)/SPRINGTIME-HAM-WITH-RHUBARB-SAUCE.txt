Do not preheat oven.  Place ham, straight from the refrigerator, on a
rack in a shallow roasting pan. Add 1/2 cup water. Insert a meat
thermometer into the thickest part of the ham. Cover the pan tightly
with aluminum foil, leaving the thermometer dial exposed. Roast in a
325 oven until thermometer registers 135 degrees, about 19-23 minutes
per pound.

Meanwhile, combine rhubarb, sugar, orange juice, orange peel, dry
mustard and cinnamon stick in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium and cook, uncovered, about 15 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Remove cinnamon stick.

Remove aluminum foil from ham and spoon a small amount of sauce over
the ham 15 minutes before end of cooking time. Remove ham when meat
thermometer registers 135 degrees. Allow ham to stand, covered, about
10 minutes, or until the thermometer registers 140^. Serve remaining
sauce with ham. Makes 2 1/4 cups sauce.
