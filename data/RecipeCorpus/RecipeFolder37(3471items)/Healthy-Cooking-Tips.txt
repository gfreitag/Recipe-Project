Keep it lean -- when using chicken or turkey, remove the skin. For
even les fat, choose light meat more often than dark meat.

Think thin -- choose leaner cuts of meat (sirloin, top round or loin)
and trim visible fat before slicing or cooking.

Depending upon your calorie needs, it is recommended that 6 to 11
servings of grains -- breads, cereals, rice and pasta be included
each day. These foods are naturally low in fat and supply complex
carbohydrates, an important source of energy. Whole grains such as
brown rice and whole wheat bread are also good sources of fiber.

Cut back on fat -- use nonstick cooking sprays in place of oil when
browning meats, stir-frying or when a recipe calls for a greased pan
or dish.

Cook the low-fat way -- broil, roast on a rack, bake or steam poultry,
meat or fish rather than frying to help reduce total fat.

Use lemon juice, garlic, herbs and spices to perk up the flavors of
vegetables instead of rich sauces made with cream, butter or cheese.

Eat less fried foods and drain offf as much fat as possible after
cooking.

Try using skim, 1% or 2% milk in place of whole milk.
