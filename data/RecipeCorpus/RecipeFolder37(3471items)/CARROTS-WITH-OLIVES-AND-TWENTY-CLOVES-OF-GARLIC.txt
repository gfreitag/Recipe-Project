Title: CARROTS WITH OLIVES AND TWENTY CLOVES OF GARLIC
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Carrots; cut into 1" chunks
1/2 ts Dried rosemary leaves
1/4 c  Coarsely chopped olive meat
-(preferably oil-cured)
1/4 ts Sea salt; or to taste
1 tb Olive oil or canola oil
1 lg Onion
- peeled & coarsely chopped
20 sm Garlic cloves; peeled, whole
1 c  Vegetable stock
PRESSURE COOKER:

1.  Heat the oil in in the cooker and saute the onions and garlic
until the onions are soft, about 2 minutes.

2.  Add the stock (watch for sputtering oil!) and bring to the boil.
Add the carrots, rosemary, olives and salt.

3.  Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure.
Lower the pressure with a quick-release method.  Remove the lid,
tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape.  If the
carrots are not quite done, set the lid back into place and let them
cook in the residual steam for another minute or two.

4.  Serve the mixture in small bowls or lift out the solid
ingredients with a slotted spoon and serve them on a plate, reserving
any leftover liquid for cooking grains or adding to the soup pot.

STANDARD STOVETOP: In a heavy 3-quart saucepan, follow steps 1 and 2.
Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until
the carrots are tender, about 8 to 12 minutes.  Follow step 4.

VARIATION: Potatoes with Twenty Cloves of Garlic:  Replace the
carrots with small new potatoes about 1 ounce each, or larger
thin-skinned potatoes cut into chunks.  Cook them for 5 minutes under
high-pressure, or 12 to 15 minutes standard stovetop method.
