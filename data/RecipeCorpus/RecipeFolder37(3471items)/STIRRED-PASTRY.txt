and stir lightly with a fork until no dry flour shows.  Pat the
dough
into two balls.  Roll the bottom crust out 2 inches larger than
the
pie pan.  Ease the dough into the pie pan and fit it loosely but
firmly.  Roll out the top crust.  Fill the pie, then put on the
top
crust and cut vents in it (or cover the pie with lattice strips).

recipe. ~--
