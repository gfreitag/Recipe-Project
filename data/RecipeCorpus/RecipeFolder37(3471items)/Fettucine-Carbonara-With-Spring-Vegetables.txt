Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 1 servings
- ounces) -- grated
1/4 ts Pepper
1/2 lb Fettucine or other broad
- noodles
1 pk 10 oz frozen peas -- thawed
6 oz Sliced lean ham (smoked or
- boiled)
2    Carrots
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese (about 2
1.  Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot.

2.  Meanwhile, keeping the ham slices in a stack, cut the ham into
1/2-inch wide strips.  Cut the carrots into very thin (1/8-inch)
rounds.

3.  In a small bowl, beat the eggs, Parmesan and pepper together.

4.  Add the fettucine to the boiling water and cook until almost
done, 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the carrots and peas and cook the
pasta and vegetables for 2 minutes longer, or until the pasta
is al dente and the carrots are crisp tender.

5.  Place a colander over a large heatproof serving bowl.  Drain
the pasta and vegetables into the colander, letting the boiling
water heat the bowl.  Pour the water out of the bowl and add the
drained hot pasta and vegetables.  Immediately pour the beaten
egg mixture over the hot pasta and toss to cook the eggs and coat
the pasta.

6.  Add the ham and toss.  Serve hot.

Time-Savers
Do-ahead:  The ham and carrots can be prepared ahead.

Microwave tip:  The peas can be thawed in the microwave.

Substitution:  If you use fresh fettucine, you can cut the cooking
time by as much as 10 minutes.  Add the pasta, peas and carrots at
the same time and cook until the pasta is al dente and the carrots
are crisp tender, 2 to 3 minutes.  If you use fresh noodles that are
thinner than fettucine, they will cook more quickly, so add the peas
and carrots  first and let them cook for about 1 minute before
adding the pasta.
