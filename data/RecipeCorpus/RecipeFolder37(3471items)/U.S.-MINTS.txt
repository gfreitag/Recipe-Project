FOR THE BROWNIES: Position the rack in lowest third of oven and

2-inch-high sides. Fold 18x12-inch piece in half crosswise.  Line pan
with foil, allowing foil to extend over two sides.  Butter foil.
Melt both chocolates and butter in heavy medium saucepan over very
low heat, stirring until smooth. Cool.
Sift flour and salt into small bowl.  Mix cream, espresso powder and
creme de menthe in small cup.  Using electric mixer, beat eggs and
sugar in large bowl until frothy.  Fold in coffee mixture and then
melted chocolate.  Fold in dry ingredients.  Spread batter evenly in
prepared pan.  Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out with
some moist crumbs still attached, about 25 minutes (surface may
crack).  Gently press down on any raised surfaces to flatten
slightly.  Cool 30 minutes on rack. FOR GLAZE: Melt both chocolates
and butter in heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring until
smooth.  Let stand until cool enough to spread. Spread glaze over
brownies.  Let stand 4 hours at room temperature. Lift brownies from
pan using foil sides.  Cut into squares.  (Can be prepared 1 day
ahead.  Store in airtight container.)
