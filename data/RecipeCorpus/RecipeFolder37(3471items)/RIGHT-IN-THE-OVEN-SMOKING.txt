Categories: Meats, Information
Yield: 1 servings
1    Steamer or rack that fits
-inside pan
Meat or fish to smoke
3 tb Liquid smoke
1    6 qt pan or casserole
-with tight fitting lid
Now you can have the smoked effect and similar flavor without a fire
using your oven.  The technique is called oven-smoking and the
ingredient that makes it possible is "liquid smoke".  This
preparation flavors foods, but it does not preserve them as true
smoking-brining folled by partial drying does.

The pale liquid, slold in small bottles alongside seasoning sauces in
the supermarket, is actually made from smoke.  As the wood burns, the
smoke is captured intubes, where it cools and condenses, and then is
filtered and bottled.  It comes in several flavors.

Oven smoking is actually a combination of baking and steaming.  The
equipment is simple:  a f to 6 quart pan with a tight lid and a rack
that will fit inside.  All you do is pour a small amount of  liqid
smoke in the pan, set foods you want to smoke on the rack, cover and
bake.  As the smoke evaporates it permeates the food.  A little goes
a long way and it tastes stronger when the food is cold.

Oven smoked foods will keep well for a few days.  To store wrap
securely to prevent smoke flavor from permeating other items in your
refrigerator.
