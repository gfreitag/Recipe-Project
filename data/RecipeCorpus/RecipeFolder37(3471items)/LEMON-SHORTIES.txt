set aside.  To make topping, put lemon peel, sugar and eggs in a
medium-size bowl.  Beat together until smooth and creamy.  Sift flour
and baking powder into bowl; fold into egg mixture.  Stir in lemon
juice.  Pour Lemon Topping over base; return to oven 25 minutes or
until very lightly browned.  Cool in pan.  When cool, cut in 30 bars.
Sprinkle powdered sugar evenly over top.
