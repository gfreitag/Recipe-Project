Title: Pogo Dough
Categories: Pastry
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
2    Eggs -- beaten
3/4 c  Sugar
Throw in a bowl.  Mix well, adding water.  The trick is to keep it as
thick as possible: BUT if too thick, the dough will not "stay" on
weiner...If so, add water a tiny bit at a time.

Once the weiner is covered with dough, deep fry.

Ta-daa!

N.B: the original recipe had milk (tastes like cake!) and baking
powder (tasted awful), and so on and so forth.
What I left there is the only thing *needed*.

And I even tried it without the eggs: if not previously frozen,
...same taste!
If you make a batch to freeze, I suggest eggs so the dough
does not "break".

Pogos can only be frozen once cooked. Unthaw, then put in oven at 275
for 20 minutes.
