MMMMM-----------------------STICKY TOPPING----------------------------
1/4 c  Butter; melted
2 tb Syrup, corn
1/2 c  Sugar, brown
1/2 c  Nuts, chopped
Place dough ingredients into pan in order listed.

Select manual or dough setting.

Mix sticky topping ingredients and spread evenly on bottom of nonstick
13"x9" or 9" round pan.

After the machine has completed the second rising, it will beep. In
the Hitachi I cheat and take it out about 10 min before the beep as
it has reached the top of the pan.

On a lightly floured surface, roll or pat to 12"x9" rectangle. Brush
with melted butter.  Combine sugars, nuts, and cinnamon; sprinkle
over dough. Starting with shorter side, roll up tightly. Pinch edge
to seal. Cut into 12 slices.  Place on greased 13"x9" pan. Or cut 9
slices, throw away the two end pieces and place in 9" round pan, with
one in the middle and the rest arranged around the outside. (looks
real nice) Cover; let rise in a warm place until almost double in
volume, (about 30 minutes).

Preheat oven to 375.  Bake 20-25 minutes.

Carefully turn out rolls and serve immediately.
