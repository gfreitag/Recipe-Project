I probably post this recipe at least once a month....maybe even
more...but I think it is wonderful. It was originally posted by Ann
Miller. Cook onion and garlic in 2 t. oil.  Add UNDRAINED tomatoes,
wine, sugar and seasonings. Cover, simmer 25 min. Add shrimp, return
to simmer and cook about 5 min. To tender. Blend cornstarch in 1 T.
cold water, stir into shrimp mixture.  Cook to bubbly.  Serve over
the hot spaghetti and sprinkle with cheese. This is also excellent
made with scallops and/or chicken.
