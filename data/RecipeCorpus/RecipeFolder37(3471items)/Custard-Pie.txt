Pastry for 9-inch One-Crust Pie

Place oven rack in lowest position. Heat oven to 450 degrees. Prepare
pastry. Beat eggs slightly with hand beater or wire whisk in medium
bowl. Beat in remaining ingredients. To prevent spilling, place
pastry-lined pie plate on oven rack. Pour filling into pie plate. Bake
20 minutes.

Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Bake 10 to 15 minutes longer
or until knife inserted halfway between center and edge comes out
clean. Refrigerate about 4 hours or until chilled. Immediately
refrigerate any remaining pie. 8 servings; 270 calories per serving.
