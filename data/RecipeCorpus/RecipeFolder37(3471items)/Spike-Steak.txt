Title: Spike Steak
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 servings
2    Cloves Garlic Minced
4 c  Coarse Salt
3/4 c  Water
2    Inch Sirloin Steak about 3
-Pounds
1 tb Black Peppercorns
Trim excess fat from steak. Crack peppercorns coarsely and mince
garlic.

Press peppercorns and garlic into both sides of steak and let stand at
room temperature for 1 hour. Make a thick past of salt and water;
cover top side of peppered steak with half the mixture. If cooking
steak over coals, cover salt side with a wet cloth or paper towel and
place salt side down on grill. (Cloth or paper holds the salt in
place; will char as the steak cooks, but this does not affect the
taste.) Cover top side with remaining salt mixture and another piece
of wet cloth or pap-er towel. If broiling, put salt side up, 3 inches
from heat. Put salt on other side of steak when it is turned. Cook 15
minutes on each side for rare, 25 minutes for medium rare. Remove
salt before eating.
