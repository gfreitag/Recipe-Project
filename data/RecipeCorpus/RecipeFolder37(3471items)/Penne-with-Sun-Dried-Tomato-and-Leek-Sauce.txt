1. Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
tender but still firm, 8-10 min. Drain well.

2. Meanwhile, trim the leeks; use the white part only. Halve the leeks
lengthwise and rinse very well to remove any grit. Cut crosswise into
thin slices.

3. Heat the sun-dried tomato oil in a large frying pan. Add the leeks
to the pan and toss to coat with the oil. Cover the pan and cook over
medium-high heat for 2 min. Uncover the pan, stir the leeks and cook
1-2 min longer, until they are softened.

4. Add the wine. Increase the heat to high and boil 3 min. Reduce the
heat to medium-high. Add the cream and sun-dried tomatoes. Boil until
the sauce is slightly reduced and thickened, about 4 min. Season with
salt and pepper to taste. Toss the pasta with the warm sauce and
serve immediately.
