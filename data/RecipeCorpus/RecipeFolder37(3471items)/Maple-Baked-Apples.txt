Title: Maple Baked Apples
Categories: Side dish, Fruit, Desserts, Syrups
Yield: 4 servings
4 ts Chopped walnuts
4 tb Maple syrup
4 tb French vanilla yogurt
4    McIntosh apples
1 c  Raisins
1/2 ts Caraway seeds
Core the apples, remove and discard the peel from the top third of
each, and place the apples in individual ovenproof baking cups.  Fill
each apple two-thirds full with raisins; top each with a 1/8 tsp
caraway seeds and a teaspoon of walnuts.  Pour 1 tablespoon maple
syrup over each and bake in a preheated 350 F oven for one hour.  Top
each with one tablespoon of yogurt and serve.

Dave's notes:  With the exception of the caraway seeds, this is a
pretty standard baked apple recipe.  When I made it for the first
time, I made two apples with the seeds and two without.  The caraway
seeds added an interesting flavor to the apples, but personally, I
didn't find it very pleasant.  I also doubled the amount of maple
syrup per apple.
