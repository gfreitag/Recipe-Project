Title: Old Cornmeal Muffins
Categories: Muffins
Yield: 1 recipe
3/4 c  Cornmeal
1    Egg
1 c  Milk
3 tb Melted fat
1 5/8 c  Flour
4 ts Baking powder
2 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
General directions for mixing and baking:

Measure all ingredients.  Prepare pans using greasy or oil.  Light
oven and set regulator at 425.  Combine dry ingredients, sifting into
bowl. Beat egg until frothy.   Add milk to egg.  Measure fat, add to
egg and milk mixture. Immediately add wet to dry ingredients, all at
one time. Stir fast until all dry ingredients are dampened - no

longer than 20 strokes. Pour at once into muffin pans.  Bake in hot
oven (425) about 20 minutes.

Note:  Too much stirring will spoil muffins.  The mixture will look
lumpy, but will come out a better texture than if over beaten, when
muffin will be full of lg holes and batter rises to peaks.
