Bone the rabbit carefully, keeping the pieces of meat as large as
possible. Wipe the rabbit meat with a damp cloth. Cut it into 12
even-sized pieces, flatten them out lightly, and season with salt,
pepper and a little finely chopped parsley and rosemary.  Put a slice
of ham on each slice of rabbit and
roll up tightly.
Take 6 skewers. Thread a roll of rabbit, 1 sage leaf, 1 sausage,
another rabbit
roll and another sage leaf on to each skewer.  Brush the skewers with
oil and
broil (grill), over charcoal if possible, or on a rack placed as
close as possible to the source of heat. Alternatively, the skewers
can also be baked in
a slow oven at 350 degrees for one hour.  Turn the skewers
occasionally, each
time brushing with oil.
