2 c  Bread flour
1/2    Egg
1/2 tb Caraway seeds
2 c  Rye sour
1/4 c  Water
1/2 pk Dry yeast

For the starter: Put onions in cheese cloth.  Mix remaining
ingredients, submerge cheese cloth into it, and let sit overnight (in
bread pan). In the morning, remove the onions. There should be 2 cups
of starter in the pan -- just what we need. Add remaining ingredients
~- use up to 1/4 cup more flour if needed to get the dough ball to
the right consistency. Also the 1/4 cup water should be added slowly,
using judgment. About 20 minutes before baking slash the top and
brush with the egg beaten with 1 tbs of water and sprinkle with
caraway seeds. ~--
