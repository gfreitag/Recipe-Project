Title: Easy Trout and Spinach Bake
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
1 pn Each nutmeg, cayenne
-and black pepper
4 oz Cheddar or Swiss cheese;
-grated
1 pk Spinach; chopped
1 1/2 lb Lake Trout fillet: cut into
-4 portions
1 cn Cream soup; chicken, celery
-or mushroom
Make a bed of the chopped spinach in a greased 8 x 8" baking dish.
Lay the fish on top of the spinach and pour undiluted soup over
the top. Sprinkle the spices and then the cheese on top of the
soup. Bake in 350 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes.

Kind of a fast, easy, down and dirty Florentine style dish.
This gets a bit better if you pan fry the trout until browned and
then place it on the spinach. Put it in the oven for about 20 min
and then use the broiler to brown the cheese.
