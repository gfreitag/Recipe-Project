Preheat oven to 375 F. Cook pasta in salted water to barely done.
Add the broccoli and boil an additional 3 min or until pasta is
tender.  Drain. Transfer to an oven proof dish or casserole,
reserving a few broccoli florets for a garnish.

In a medium saucepan combine onion, garlic, [and celery], and
butter. Saute over medium heat, stirring frequently, 5 min or
until onion is tender.

Add flour and stir to make a smooth paste. Gradually add milk,
stirring constantly to make a smooth sauce. Add the seasonings.
Stir to mix.

Reduce heat and cook, stirring, until milk has thickened. Reduce heat
to low. Cook 1 min longer. Stir in trout and continue to cook an
additional 1 or 2 min. Stir in cheese.

Pour the sauce over the pasta-broccoli mixture. Bake 15 to 20 mins
or until casserole is hot. Garnish with reserved broccoli florets
[and sliced hard cooked eggs or pimento strips if desired].

You can sub salmon, tuna or other fish for the trout. Or exchange
half the broccoli with cauliflower and play with the cheeses: both
Cheddar and Swiss are good. Also good with green peas and egg
noodles.
