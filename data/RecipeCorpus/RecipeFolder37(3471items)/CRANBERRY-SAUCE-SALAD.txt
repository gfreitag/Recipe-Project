Title: CRANBERRY SAUCE SALAD
Categories: Salads, Holiday
Yield: 2 servings
-(3 oz size)
2 3/4 c  Water (1 1/2 cup boiling)
1 cn Jellied Cranberry Sauce
1 c  Sour Cream
2    Package Raspberry Jello
Use the boiling water to disolve the packages of raspberry jello.
Add cold water ( 1 1/4 cups) to help it set up. Let it set (in fridge
is okay) until it's good and syrupy. Meanwhile, use blender to blend
cranberry sauce and sour cream thoroughly. Blend jello in carefully
(it makes for a FULL blender!). Pour into dishes, mold, whatever!
Sets in about 7 hours or so, but is best made a day ahead.

I also served this at a Christmas get-together in Dayton, and they
asked for the recipe!! I'll let that be my recomendation for it!
Welcome to the Echo, and I'll be watching to see what answers you get
on the software!
