Title: RAY BAUER'S SWEDISH RYE BREAD (LIMPA)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat or rye flour
(your choice will affect
The taste - I prefer wheat)
1 1/2 c  High gluten bread flour
2 ts Dry yeast
2 ts Gluten (IMPORTANT!)
3 tb Buttermilk powder
1 ts Fennel seeds
1 ts Cumin seeds
1 ts Caraway seeds
1/4 c  Cracked wheat
2 1/4 tb Margarine or butter
2 1/4 tb Molasses or barley malt
1 tb Grated fresh orange peel
(zest)
THIS STEP IS VERY IMPORTANT!

Combine the first 7 ingredients (using FRESH seeds only!) in 1 1/3
cup of boiling water and soak for 1 hour minimum.  (This pre-soaks
the cracked wheat and pre-releases the other flavors.)

Dump this concoction into a bowl and add the remaining 6 ingredients.

Set your bread machine to White and bake at the medium setting...

Manual -- do the normal knead and rise tricks.  Bake at 350 F for 30
~ 35 minutes.  (test this since oven temps. vary)

Makes 1 loaf
