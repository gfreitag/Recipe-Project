Title: ARROZ DULCE
Categories: Desserts, Chinese, Ethnic
Yield: 2 servings
1 c  Raisins
3    Eggs separated
3/4 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1 c  Rice
2 c  Water
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
2 c  Evaporated milk
Combine the rice, water, sugar and salt in a large saucepan. Bring the
water to a boil and cover the saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and
continue to cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the water is absorbed.
Combine the milk and egg yolks. Add them to the rice. Then mix in the
raisins, vanilla and cinnamon. Simmer for five minutes. Remove from
the heat. Beat the egg whites until stiff. Fold them into the rice.
Chill and garnish with nutmeg before serving. NOTE: I like rice
pudding warm, too.

(Rice pudding--a traditional wedding dish) I'll post some Traditional
New Mexico dessert favorites. Hope you enjoy them. They're not hard,
and they're sure tasty.
