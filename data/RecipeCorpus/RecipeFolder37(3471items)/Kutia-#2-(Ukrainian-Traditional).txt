Title: Kutia #2 (Ukrainian Traditional)
Categories: Breakfast, Appetizers, Holiday, Ukrainian
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Poppy seeds
1/3 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Honey
2 c  Wheat berries
3 qt Water
1 ts Salt
This is the ritual first dish of the 12 course Christmas Eve Supper.
The wheat represents the staff of life, the honey represents the
Spirit of Christ.

Wash the wheat and soak it in cold, salted water overnight. Next
morning, bring wheat to the boiling point, simmer for 3 - 4 hours,
until kernels burst open. Drain quickly so some of the water adheres
to the wheat and return to the pot.

Add poppy seeds, honey and sugar, stir in and cook another 5 minutes.
Serve hot as a hearty winter breakfast dish or more traditionally,
cold, as a Christmas Eve appetizer course.
