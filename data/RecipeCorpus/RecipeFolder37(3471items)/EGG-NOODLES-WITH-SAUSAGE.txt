Categories: Main dish, Pasta/rice, Breakfast, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 pk 16 oz extra wide egg noodles
Salt
2 tb Olive or salad oil
1/4 ts Italian herb seasoning
1 lb Hot Italian-sausage links
2 lg Carrots
1 md Onion
1 bn Broccoli (1 lb)
About 1 hour before serving:

In a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, heat sausages and 1/4 cup
water to boiling. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 5 minutes.
Remove cover and cook, turning sausages occasionally, until water
evaporates and sausages are browned, about 20 minutes. Remove
sausages to paper towels to drain; cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices.
Place sausage slices in a bowl. Reserve drippings in skillet.
Meanwhile, slice carrots 1/4 inch thick; dice onion. Cut off root
ends and discard tough outer leaves from the broccoli. Rinse and
drain well. In drippings in skillet over medium heat, cook carrots
and onion until vegetables are tender. Add 3/4 cup water, stirring to
loosen brown bits from bottom of skillet. Add vegetable mixture to
bowl with sausages. Wipe skillet dry. Cook noodles as label directs,
using 2 tsp salt in the water. While egg noodles are cooking, in same
skillet over high heat, in hot olive or salad oil, cook broccoli,
Italian herb seasoning, and 1/4 tsp salt until tender crisp, 3 to 5
minutes, stirring often. Return sausage mixture to skillet with
broccoli; over medium heat, heat through, stirring occasionally. Add
egg noodles; gently toss to mix well. Source: Good Housekeeping Feb/92
