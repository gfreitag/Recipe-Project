Categories: Cheese/eggs, Salads
Yield: 6 servings
Rocket
3 tb Sherry vinegar
3 tb Caster sugar
4    Sun dried tomatoes
Salt & pepper
3    100g somerset goat's cheese
2    Spanish onions
2 tb Olive oil
1 oz Butter
Mixed green salad
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE DRESSING---------------------------
8 tb Sesame oil
Salt & pepper
2 tb Red wine vinegar
2 tb Sherry vinegar
8 tb Olive oil
Make the dressing by combining the vinegars and seasoning and then
vigorously whisking in the combined oils to make a 'creamy' emulsion.
Chop the tomatoes very finely, add them to the dressing, and leave to
stand on one side.  Peel the onions and slice them into rings, no
more than 1/4in thick preferably finer.

Put the oil and butter into a frying pan and heat over a moderate
flame. Once the butter has finished bubling, add the onion rings,
stirring round until they are all well coated.  Cook for about 15
minutes, tossing and stirring frequently until the onions have
softened and taken on a little colour.  Remove the pan from the heat
and set aside.

Slice the goats cheeses into halves.  Turn the grill on high.  Quickly
dress the salad leaves with a little of the dressing and divide
between 6 plates. Then place the cheese halves on a baking tray,  cut
side up, and put under for about 5 minutes, or until the tops are
covered with golden brown freckles and the cheese inside has started
to melt.  Put the onions back over a high flame and, stirring
continually, tip in the sherry vinegar and sugar.  Bubble furiously
for a couple of minutes until you can see the juices have turned
syrupy.  Remove from the heat and season lavishly with salt and
pepper.

To serve, put a goat's cheese half on each plate with the salad and
then strew with the sweet and sour onions.  Finally, dress with
another tablespoon of the dressing, making sure that each plate gets
a good sprinkling of sun-dried tomatoes.
