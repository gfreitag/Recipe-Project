Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
- thinly sliced
1/2 c  Clarified butter; melted
4    Filet mignons (10 oz. each)
12 oz Roquefort cheese, crumbled
12    Shitake mushrooms
MMMMM-----------------------RED WINE SAUCE----------------------------
2 tb Sweet butter
- cut into small pieces
Salt (to taste)
1/2 c  Red wine

2 c  Veal stock
In a side of each filet mignon make a slit 1" long.  Stick a paring
knife through the slit and cut out a pocket inside the filet.
Stuff the filets with alternating layers of the cheese and the
mushroms. End the top layer with the mushrooms.  Press the slit
together so that it closes.
In a large skillet place the butter and heat it on medium high until
it is hot.  Add the stuffed filet mignons and sautÂ‚ them for 4 to 6
minutes on each side, or until the desired doneness is achieved.
Pour the Red Wine Sauce over the top of the filets.
RED WINE SAUCE:  In a small saucepan place the red wine and the
shallots. Cook them on medium high for 4 to 6 minutes, or until the
liquid is reduced to 3 tablespoons.  Add the veal stock and cook the
sauce for 15 minutes, or until it is reduced by 1/4.  While whisking
constantly, add the pieces of butter one at a time.  Add the salt and
stir it in.
