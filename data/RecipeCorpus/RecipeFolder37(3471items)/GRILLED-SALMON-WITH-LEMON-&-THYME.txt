Title: GRILLED SALMON WITH LEMON & THYME
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 10 servings
1 1/2 tb Kosher salt
1 1/2 tb Sugar, brown
1 tb Thyme, fresh; minced
3/4 ts Pepper
4 lb Salmon fillet; skinned
3 tb Cognac
1/4 c  Lemon peel; minced
2 tb Shallot; minced
Place salmon fillets on heavy large baking sheet.  Rub Cognac over
both sides of fish.  Mix together all remaining ingredients in small
bowl. Rub over both sides of fish.  Cover with plastic wrap. Top with
another baking sheet.  Weight with heavy object. Refrigerate at least
6 hours or overnight.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill fish until cooked through,
about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to plates and serve.

Note: Bon Appetit recommends a sturdy red wine, such as a Beaujolais
from Moulin-a-Vent.  They also recommend serving with sauteed zuc-
chini. You could also diagonally slice thickly some zucchini with
peel left on and brush with butter, lemon and thyme mixture and grill
next to the fish; a Griffo grill would help but if you sliced the
zucchini thick enough and on a strong enough diagonal, I don't think
you would have problems with it falling through the grill. Some fresh
steamed green beans with butter and freshly ground pepper would also
be good.
