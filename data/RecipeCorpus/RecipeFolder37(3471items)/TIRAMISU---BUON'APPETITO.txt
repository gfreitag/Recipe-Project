results. You can use any kind of spirits or liqueurs in the dessert
(marsala, vin santo, rum, brandy, Tia Maria, Frangelico, Amaretto) be
guided by your own tastes. If you can't find mascarpone, use 8oz
ricotta and double the amount of whipping cream. If you don't have an
espresso maker, use strong black coffee.
1. In a heavy pot, on medium-low heat, whisk together sugar and eggs
until frothy. Continue whisking until mixture begins to thicken.
Whisk in 1/4 cup marsala and continue to cook until mixture coats the
back of a spoon. Scrape
into bowl and reserve.
2. Whip cream until it holds its shape. With same beaters, whisk
mascarpone and lemon rind together until mixture softens. Fold in
egg/marsala mixture and whipping cream.
3. Combine espresso and remaining 2Tb marsala. Dip lady fingers into
coffee mixture two at a time and soak evenly. Place a layer of lady
fingers on bottom of 11x7 inch dish. Spread with half of the
mascarpone creame. Sprinkle
with grated chocolate. Add another layer of soaked lady fingers. Top
with mascarpone cream and remaining chocolate.
