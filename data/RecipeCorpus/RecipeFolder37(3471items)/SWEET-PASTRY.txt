Title: SWEET PASTRY
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
-well chilled
1 ts Lemon zest; opt
1    Egg
1 1/4 c  Flour
1/4 c  Sugar; granulated
3 1/2 oz Butter; unsalted
can use 7 Tbsp of butter
This pastry is very sticky because of the high fat content, best
made in the food processor. Roll the chilled pieces of butter in the
flour to help reduce the stickiness. Roll it out on two pieces of
Saran wrap, lift the wrap to transfer in the flan pan and peel off.
This pastry is forgiving (can be patched) and is important for Lemon
Tart as a flavour contrast.
Put flour and sugar in food processor bowl and pulse 1-2 times to
aerate. Roll cubes off butter in flour and distribute over flour &
sugar in work bowl. Process briefly till mixture reassembles fine
meal. Drop egg down chute while processor is going. Process briefly
till egg is incorporated. Turn on on Saran Wrap covered surface and
form into ball. Refrigerate for at least an hour. Roll out on Saran
Wrap covered surface. (You may add extra flour although it will
toughen it slightly.) Roll to thickness 1/8" and 3" larger in
diameter than flan tin. Transfer carefully, trim edges and put in
fridge for at least an hour. Preheat oven to 375F oven. When it is at
the right temperature, put pastry lined tin in centre and bake 15
minutes. If browning too much, turn oven down to 325F. Remove form
oven and allow to cool before removing from oven.
