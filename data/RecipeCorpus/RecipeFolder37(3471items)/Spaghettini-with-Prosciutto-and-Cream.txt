Title: Spaghettini with Prosciutto and Cream
Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Italian parsley, chopped
1/2 ts Fresh ground pepper
2 c  Grated Asiago cheese
6 oz Prosciutto
1 lb Dried spaghettini
3 c  Heavy cream
1. Preheat the broiler. Cut the prosciutto into  1/2-inch ribbons.

2. Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
tender but still firm, 6-8 min. Drain well.

3. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, bring the cream to a boil over
medium-high heat. Boil the cream gently until it thickens, about 5
min. Add the parsley and pepper to the cream.

4. Toss the drained pasta with the cream sauce, prosciutto and 1 cup
of the Asiago cheese. Spoon the pasta into a 15-inch gratin dish.
Sprinkle with the remaining cheese.

5. Place the gratin dish under the broiler and broil about 2 min,
until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned and the dish is hot.
