Categories: Cheese/eggs, Desserts, Cake/cookie, Chocolate
Yield: 10 servings
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
3/4 c  Sour cream
2 tb Unsweetened cocoa
6 oz White chocolate chips
1 lb Cream cheese
3/4 c  Sugar
3    Eggs
MMMMM----------------------RASPBERRY SAUCE---------------------------
Sugar to taste
2 1/2 c  Raspberries
Place chocolate in a double boiler and heat over hot water until it
melts. Stir to blend and let cool to room temperature.

With an electric mixer, blend cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in
eggs, vanilla, and sour cream.  Stir in melted chocolate. NOTE: it is
important to have the cheesecake ingredients and the melted chocolate
close to the same temperature when they are combined so that they
blend together smoothly.  Pour into a greased 9-inch springform pan.
Bake in the middle of a preheated 325F oven for 25 minutes or until
just barely set. Turn off the oven, leave the door ajar, and let cool
in oven for 1 hour longer. Chill. Just before serving, dust cocoa
through a sieve making a ring around the cheesecake.

Prepare raspberry sauce:  Reserve 1/2 cup raspberries for garnish. In
a blender, puree the remaining berries and push through a sieve. Stir
in sugar to taste. To serve, spoon raspberry sauce on to desert
plates. Remove pan sides of cheesecake and cut into wedges. Place on
raspberry sauce and garnish with berries.
