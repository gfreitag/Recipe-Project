MOUSSAKA
========
Moussaka is an authentic Greek dish.  With time, it found its way to
Israel via Turkey.  It is a specialty of many Greek-style restaurants
which abound in Israel's cities.  Each ethnic community tends to
improvise and cover the moussaka in its own favorite way, topping it
with cheese, gravy, etc.  This is the standard Israeli version.

Cut eggplants (unpeeled) into rings.  Sprinkle with salt and let
stand for one hour.  Wash under water and dry.  Saut  onions in one
tbs. oil until soft. Add garlic and meat and fry until lightly
browned.  Remove from heat and add tomato paste/water mixture.  Set
aside.

Sprinkle flour on eggplant slices and fry in one tbs. oil until brown.
Layer fried eggplant slices in a casserole dish with meat mixture.
Repeat layering until full.  Bake for 40 minutes.  Mix corn starch in
stock/water, add eggs and pour on top of meat mixture.  Return to
oven and bake at 325 deg F (170 deg C) until gravy begins to be
absorbed.  Serve hot.
