VEGETABLE SALAD

The idea of salad for breakfast is probably a little strange to North
Americans.  But this trademark Mediterranean salad is enjoyed by
Israelis three times a day--breakfast, lunch, and supper--regardless
of whether they are from Russia, Morocco, Yemen, or the United States.

Cut vegetables (except carrots) into small cubes.  Grate carrot and
egg. Garnish with parsley.  Combine lemon juice and oil, add to salad
before serving and mix well.
