Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 4 servings
2 cn (14 1/2 oz ea)
Pasta-ready tomatoes
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Fresh ground pepper
1 lb Dried fettuccine
2    (to 3) garlic clove(s)
1 md Butternut squash

1. Cook the fettuccine in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
tender but still firm, 7-9 min. Drain well.

remove the seeds and strings. Place the squash, cut sides down, on a
microwave-safe plate and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave on HIGH
until tender, 8-10 min.

3. While the squash is cooking, combine the olive oil and garlic in a

brown, about 1 min. Add the tomatoes with their juices to the pan and
simmer 2-3 min.

4. Scoop the squash from its shell and mash with a fork until smooth.
Add the squash puree to the tomatoes and stir to combine. Season with
salt and pepper.

5. Puree the sauce in a blender or food processor until smooth.
Return the sauce to the pan. Add the drained fettuccine and toss to
heat through.
