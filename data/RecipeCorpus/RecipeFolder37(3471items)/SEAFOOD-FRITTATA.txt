Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Dried oregano
3 tb White wine
2    Eggs
1/4 c  Half and half
2    Tabsco, shakes
1    Tomatoes, thinly sliced
1/2 c  Cheese, shredded
Sour cream
1/4 c  Clarified butter
1/2 c  Salmon, 1-inch pieces
1/2 c  Bay or sea scallops
1/2 c  Rockfish, firm white fish
1/3 c  Shrimp, small
1/3 c  Mushrooms, sliced
1/4 c  Onions, thinly sliced
Garlic cloves, crushed
Lemon juice
In 1/4 cup clarified butter, saute 1/2 cup 1-inch salmon pieces, 1/2
cup scallops, 1/2 cup rockfish pieces (firm white fish), 1/3 cup
shrimp, 1/3 cup sliced mushrooms, 1/4 cup thinly sliced onions, 1/2
teasp. oregano and 2- 3 Tablespoons white wine.
In a bowl beat 3 eggs.  Add 1/4 cup half and half and 2 shakes of
Tabasco. Beat well.
Slice one tomato in thin slices, set slices aside.
Heat butter in a small omelette pan, add egg mixture.
When eggs have begun to set around the edge, add seafood mixture.
Work the mixture together, gently. When the mixture has begun to set,
remove from the heat.
Place the tomato slices on top in a circular pattern. Sprinkle with
shredded or chunked cheese. Place pan in 425 degree ove for 4-5
minutes. Remove to serving plate, add a dollop of sour cream.
Low fat sour cream can be substituted, and I like to use a non-stick
pan to cut down on the butter used.
