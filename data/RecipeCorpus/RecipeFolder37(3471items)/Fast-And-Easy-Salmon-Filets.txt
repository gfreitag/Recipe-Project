Title: Fast And Easy Salmon Filets
Categories: Microwave, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Lemon juice
1 lb Of salmon (steaks or filets)
2 tb Olive oil
Fast and easy salmon filets

a generous 1/2 tsp dried basil
several grinds of black pepper

Mix all ingredients but the salmon, pour over salmon and let stand for
about a half hour.

Microwave on high for btwn 4 and 5 minutes, until just done.  Let
stand for three minutes.

(in my microwave book it said 5 minutes, which was a trifle too long.
they could have been improved by some undercooking, I think...  but
there was not a trace of salmon left over, so I guess that wasn't
toooo bad.)
