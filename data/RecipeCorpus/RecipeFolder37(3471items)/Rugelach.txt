RUGELACH
========
On Fridays, you can smell the distinct aroma of rugelach on every
street corner in Israel.  People anxious to buy them for the weekend
will line up at their neighborhood bakery to get them hot out of the
oven. Unfortunately, due to their small size, there never seems to be
enough of these delicious pastries to go around.
