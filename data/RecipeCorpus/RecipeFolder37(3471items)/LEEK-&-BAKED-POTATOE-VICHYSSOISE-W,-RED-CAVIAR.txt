Yield: 6 -8
1 c  Non-fat yogurt or evaporated
Skim milk
1/4 c  Red salmon roe caviar
1/4 c  Snipped fresh chives
2 lb Large baking potatoes
6 c  Vegetable broth
6 lg Leeks(about 2-1/2-3#) white
Parts only
1/2 ts Fresh ground white pepper
Preheat oven to 400deg.  Bake potatoes on the floor of the oven,
turning once, for 1 hour or until they are soft when pressed.  Cut
the cooked potatoes in half and scoop out the flesh.
Cut leeks in half lengthwise, wash throughly to get out all sand
and grit and chop coarsely.
In a large saucepan, bring the broth to a boil over moderately high
heat. Add the chopped leeks and white pepper, reduce heat and simmer
the leeks, covered for 30 minutes or until they are very tender.
Add the potato flesh to the leeks and puree the mixture in batches
in a food processor until very smooth.  Transfer the puree to a
mixing bowl, add salt if desired and chill covered for at least 2
hours or up to 24 hours.
Whisk in the yogurt or milk and chill again for 30 minutes if
necessary.
Ladle the soup into bowls and top each serving with
1-1/2-2teaspoons of red caviar and sprinkle with chives.
Serve in chilled bowls.
