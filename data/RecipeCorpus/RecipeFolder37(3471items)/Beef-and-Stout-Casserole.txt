Title: Beef and Stout Casserole
Categories: Scot/irish, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
Salt and pepper
Basil and parsley
1 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
1 tb Wine or cider vinegar
1    Bottle of stout
1 1/2 lb Beef
6 oz Lean bacon, cubed
1 lb Shallots or small onions
3    Cloves garlic
1    Bouquet garni
1 tb Sugar
Saute the beef and bacon in a little oil.  Drain off the excess
liquid. Remove the meat anmd set aside.  Add the butter to the pan,
and melt. Stir in the flour to make a roux.  Gradually stir in the
stout.  Place the meat and the small onions (peeled) in a deep
casserole dish, and season with the salt, pepper and herbs.  Crush
the garlic and add to the ingredients.  Sprinkle the sugar on top,
and pour in the sauce.  Cover and place in the oven.  Cook very
gently for up to 3 hours at 300F.  Check occasionally.  If the
casserole seems to be drying a little, you can add more stout.
Remove from the oven and mix in the vinegar.  Serve with lots of
boiled potatoes to sop up the sauce.
