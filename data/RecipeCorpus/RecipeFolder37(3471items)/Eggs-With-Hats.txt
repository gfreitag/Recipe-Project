Title: Eggs With Hats
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Breakfast, Snacks
Yield: 1 serving
1 lg Egg
Salt and pepper
2 sl Bacon; cut in 1/2
1 sl White bread
Cut a round hole in the bread with a small juice glass.

Fry the bacon, remove from the pan and set aside, reserving the bacon
fat. Fry the small circle of bread on both sides. Meanwhile fry the
slice of bread with the hole in it on one side; turn and break the
egg into the hole. Season to taste with salt and pepper. By the time
the egg sets the bottom of the fried bread should be finished.

Garnish the bread with two horizontal rows and two vertical columns of
bacon surrounding the egg in a grid like the grates in a prison
window. Top the egg with the small circle of fried bread... the egg's
hat.

This also gets called Eggs In Prison.
