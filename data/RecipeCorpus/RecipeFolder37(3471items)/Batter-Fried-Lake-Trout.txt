Title: Batter Fried Lake Trout
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  A pancake mix
1 1/2 c  Club soda; or beer
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
1 1/2 lb Lake trout fillet
;Water
Flour
1 1/2 c  Pepe's batter mix; or
Pepe's brand name is one of the tastiest prepared mixes I have ever
come across. Pancake mixes will need additional seasoning: dry
mustard, garlic powder and paprika.

Mix together the pancake mix with the club soda, to make a thin
batter. You may have to add a little more club soda to achieve the
right consistency. Set aside.

Cut the trout fillet in half lengthwise and then cut the two thin
fillets into 4 portions. Moisten each in a bit of water.  Shake off
excess water and coat lightly in plain flour.  Let the pieces dry 3
or 4 minutes on waxed paper or on a rack without touching each other.

With tongs dip each piece to coat evenly but lightly in prepared fish
batter.  Drop at once into hot oil in a non-stick skillet and fry 2-4
min each side, turning only once.

Use a spatula not tongs to remove fish from the pan or the coating
will break and fall apart. Hold on a cookie sheet (ungreased) and
keep pieces warm in a 250 F oven till all pieces have been fried.

This batter is good for deep fried fish of all sorts as well.
