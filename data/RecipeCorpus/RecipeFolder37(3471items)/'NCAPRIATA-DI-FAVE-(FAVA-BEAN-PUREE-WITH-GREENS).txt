Categories: Salads, Italian, Appetizers, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
12 oz Broccoli or rabe
1/3 c  Water
1 tb Salt
3 tb Fruity olive oil
2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
8 oz Dried fava beans, soaked
2 ea Celery ribs, chopped
1 md Onion, chopped
2 ts Salt
2 tb Fruity olive oil
Drain the beans & slip them outr of their skins.  If the skins cling
too tightly, boil them for 5 to 10 minutes & then skin.  Put peeled
beans in a pot with celery & onion.  Add just enough water to cover &
bring to a simmer.  Add the 2 ts salt, cover & cook for 20 to 25
minutes or until the beans are very soft.  Add more water if
necessary.  Drain & place in a processor with the 2 tb olive oil.
Clean the broccoli rabe by peeling off any thick skin covering the
larger stems & cut into 2" pieces.  Rinse the greens well.  Bring the
water to a boil, add the greens & 1 tb salt, cover & cook until the
greens are soft but not mushy, 5 minutes.  Drain.
Warm the 3 tb olive oil in a skillet & slowly saute the garlic just
enough until it is golden brown & soft.  Do not let it brown.  Add
the greens & swilr them around in well flavoured oil.  Serve on a
platter, spooning the garlic infused greens over the favas.
