Categories: Vegetables, Salads

2 lb Firm Japanese eggplant

This is a dish whose flavors improve with time, so make it when you
have your grill going anyway. Grill the eggplant when the coals are
dying, assemble the recipe, and it will be ready for a meal the next
day. WIPE EGGPLANTS AND SLICE lengthwise or diagonally into pieces a
little less than 1/2-inch thick. Discard the end pieces that are
mostly skin. Brush each piece on both sides with oil and grill over
the coals. (You can also fry the eggplant slices instead of grilling
them, or even broil them, if you prefer.) To make crisscross grill
marks, turn each slice just once at a 45-degree angle. Cook on both
sides until eggplant is nicely colored and tender. As you work, make
a layer of cooked eggplant in a non-corrosive dish. Season with salt
and freshly ground pepper, scatter garlic and basil leaves on top and
splash a little vinegar over all. Add the next layer of eggplant and
continue until everything is used. The warmth from the eggplant will
bring out the flavors of the garlic and the basil. It will smell
wonderful. Cover the dish and refrigerate for several hours or
overnight. Bring to room temperature before serving. ---
