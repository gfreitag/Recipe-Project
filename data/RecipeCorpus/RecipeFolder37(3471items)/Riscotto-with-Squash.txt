Title: Riscotto with Squash
Categories: P-cooker, Side dish, Vegetarian, Pasta/rice
Yield: 4 servings
-seeded, cut into 1" chunks
-(about 3 c)
1 ts Salt; or to taste
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese; freshly
-grated
Pepper to taste;
2 tb Fresh parsley; minced
1 tb Olive oil;
1 c  Onions; finely chopped-=OR=-
1 c  Shallot finely chopped
1 ts Dried sage leaves; GENEROUS
1 1/2 c  Arborio rice;
3 1/2 c  To 4 c. vegetable stock;
1 lb Butternut squash; peeled
Heat oil in the cooker.  Cook the shallots over medium-high heat,
stirring frequently, for 1 minute.  Add the sage and rice, stirring
to coat the rice.  Stir in 3-1/2 cups of the stock (stand back to
avoid sputtering oil) and bring to a boil.  Add squash and salt.
Lock lid in place.  Over high heat, bring to high pressure.  Lower
heat, bring to high pressure. Lower heat just to maintain high
pressure, and cook for 5 minutes.  Reduce pressure with the
quick-release method. (The quick-release method is to run water over
the pressure cooker at the faucet). Remove the lid, tilting it away
from you to allow any excess steam to escape.   If risotto isn't
creamy, stir in bit more stock.  Cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly, until the rice achieves the desired consistency (it
should be tender but chewy) and squash is partially pureed.  Stir in
Parmesan, pepper and parsley.  Serve in soup bowls.
