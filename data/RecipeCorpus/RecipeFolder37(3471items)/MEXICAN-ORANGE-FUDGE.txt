Golden color and rich flavor is achieved by the caramelization of the
sugar, and the addition of orange rind. Melt 1 cup sugar in a heavy
3-quart saucepan, stirring constantly so it does not burn. Very
carefully, add boiling water to mix. Add remaining sugar, coffee
cream, and salt. Place over medium heat and stir until all
ingredients are blended together and mixture boils. Cook to 238
degrees F. without stirring. Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm,
beat until candy loses its gloss and holds its shape. Fold in grated
orange rind and nuts. Spread in a buttered 8-inch square pan. Cut
into squares. Makes about 48 pieces.
