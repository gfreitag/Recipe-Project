Title: Vlf: Super Bowl Brownies (Ovo)
Categories: Cake/cookie, Low cal/fat, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
In small bowl beat until
Creamy:
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Almond extract
4    Egg whites -- at room temp
1 c  Honey
In a large bowl sift:
1 c  Flour
1 c  Cocoa
1 pn Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Packed brown sugar
These are extremely low in fat, and the taste is more slightly bitter
dark chocolate than the milk-chocolate sweet of most brownies,
however if you love chocolate, they're a great treat!

Combine and mix well.  Pour into a 13 x 9 baking pan sprayed with
non-stick spray.  Bake at 375 (350 glass) 15-20 minutes.  Poke with a
toothpick and if it comes out with fudgy crumbs, it's done.

Do not overbake!  Cool completely before cutting into pieces.  You can
add chopped nuts, however it will raise the fat content substantially.
