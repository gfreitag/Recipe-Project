Title: Ravioli with Creamy Vodka and Tomato Sauce
Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Vodka
1 1/2 c  Bottled spicy red-pepper
Pasta sauce
Salt and pepper
18 oz Fresh cheese ravioli
1/2 c  Oil-packed
Sun-dried tomatoes, drained
2 c  Heavy cream
1. Cook the ravioli in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
tender but still firm, 5-6 min. Drain well.

2. Meanwhile, coarsely chop the sun-dried tomatoes and combine with
the cream in a large saucepan. Bring the cream to a boil over high
heat. Reduce the heat to medium and boil gently until the cream
thickens, about 5 min. Add the vodka and red-pepper pasta sauce. Cook
the sauce 3-4 min, stirring occasionally, for the flavors to combine.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.

3. Pour the sauce into a blender or food processor and puree until
smooth. Return the sauce to the pan and add the ravioli. Toss the
ravioli and sauce together over medium heat to warm thoroughly.
