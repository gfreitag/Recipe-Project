No problem, Burt.  It doesn't matter much what kind of fish you're
using, just preheat your oven to 350 degrees (F).  Now place the fish
in a shallow, rimmed pan.

Brush the fish with melted butter or margarine, and sprinkle with
whatever seasonings suit you.  Add a small splash of water, wine,
clam juice, fish stock, or whatever liquid you desire (the liquid
should cover the bottom of the pan to a depth of less than 1/4 inch).

Now, measure the thickness of the fish.  If the fish is less than one
inch thick, you will need to cook the fish for NO MORE than 10
minutes (check after 8 minutes, if it begins to  flake, it's done).
If it measures more than one inch at its thickest point, bake for 10
minutes per inch.

Do not overcook.  One of the classic jokes in the restaurant business
is that you don't really need to COOK fish -- just give it to a slow
waiter and have him/her walk it through a hot kitchen:-) More truth
to that than I'd care to think about....
