Title: GREEN BEANS WITH WATER CHESTNUTS
Categories: Vegetables, Low cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
1/3 c  Thin sliced water chestnuts
1 ts Soy sauce
Freshly ground pepper
12 oz Fresh green beans
1/2 c  Chicken broth
1 ts Finely chopped ginger root
1 sm Clove garlic, finely chopped
Slice the green beans and water chestnuts ahead of time, but cook just
before meal time.  Serve tender-crisp and piping hot.  Thin, fresh
asparagus spears can be substituted for green beans.

Wash and drain green beans.  French-cut in half lengthwise; set aside.
Combine chicken broth, ginger root and garlic in a frypan; bring to a
boil. Add green beans and water chestnuts.  Sprinkle with soy sauce.
Cover tightly and steam 7 to 8 min until tender-crisp.  If moisture
has not dried off, remove cover, raise heat briefly and shake pan to
evaporate remaining liquid.  Season to taste with pepper.
