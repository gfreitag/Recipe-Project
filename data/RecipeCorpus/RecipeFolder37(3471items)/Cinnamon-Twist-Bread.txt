Title: Cinnamon Twist Bread
Categories: Breadmaker
Yield: 1 pound loaf
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Yeast
6 oz Buttermilk or powder
3 tb Honey
1    Egg
2 tb Butter
2 1/4 c  Bread flour
Put all the ingredients in the pan.   Start the bread machine. Cover a
bread board with plastic wrap and dust with flour. When the machine
stops kneading, remove the dough from the container with your hands,
leaving the bread pan in place in your machine and close the lid.
Place dough on floured board.   Dust top of dough and your hands with
flour. Pat dough into a 6"x 10" rectangle. Combine 2 teaspoons
cinnamon and 1 tsp. sugar. Spoon mixture in three long rows, down the
dough. Roll dough into a fat cylinder, left to right, then fold it in
half twisting the ends together.
Place the dough, ends down, back in the bread machine, close the lid
and continue the cycle.

be sure to keep the machine closed while you are putting the cinnamon
on so any heat in the machine stays in.   Work as quickly as possible
because the machine still ticks off the time while you're doing it.

I use powdered butter milk, 3 tb and 6 oz warm water.  I have left
out the egg and reduced the flour to 2 c with great success.  I have
also replaced the honey with sugar.  I have also reduced the amount
of sugar in the dough to 2 tb and found it to be sweet enough.
In other word, the basic recipe is great, but modifications don't
seem to bother it.  Remember, you will be playing with the dough, so
don't worry if the dough is sticky at first, you will be adding some
flour when rolling it
out.
Have fun and enjoy.
