Title: LEMON BUTTER MOUSSE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 12 servings
6    Eggs; separated, room temp.
1/4 ts Salt
3 c  Sifted confectioners' sugar
1/4 lb Unsalted butter; room temp.
1/3 c  Fresh lemon juice; PLUS:
3 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 ts Finely grated lemon zest
1/4 oz Unflavored gelatin
1 c  Heavy cream
In a small heatproof bowl, stir together the first amount of lemon
juice and the lemon zest.  Sprinkle on the gelatin and set aside to
soften for 10 minutes. Set the bowl in a saucepan of hot water over
low heat and stir to dissolve the gelatin.  Remove from the heat and
let cool to room temperature.

In a large bowl, whip cream until just stiff.  Cover and refrigerate
until needed.

In a deep bowl, combine egg whites with the salt. Beat until soft
peaks form.  Gradually add 1 cup of the confectioners' sugar and beat
until stiff peaks form.

In another bowl, beat the butter until soft and fluffy. Add 1 cup of
the confectioners' sugar and beat until smooth. One at a time, add
the egg yolks, alternating with the dissolved gelatin and the
remaining 1 cup confectioners' sugar.  Continue to beat until smooth.
Fold in one-third of the egg whites. Quickly but gently fold in the
remaining egg whites.

Beat the remaining lemon juice into the whipped cream and fold into
the mousse.  Turn into a serving dish or stemmed wine glasses, cover
and refrigerate until chilled and set, about 3 hours.
