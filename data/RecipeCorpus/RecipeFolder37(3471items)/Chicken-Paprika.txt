CHICKEN PAPRIKA

Chicken is extremely popular in Israel, because it is relatively
inexpensive
and can be prepared in many ways.  Chicken paprika is, of course, a
Hungarian variation.  With the amount of chicken Israelis consume, it
is hard to imagine a family going without it for very long.

Cut up chicken and season with flour, salt and pepper.  Brown chicken
in the
fat (or margarine).  Remove chicken and brown onions in remaining fat
(or margarine).  Return chicken to the pan, sprinkle with paprika and
add water.
Cover and cook over low heat for 1-1/2 hours or until chicken is
tender.
