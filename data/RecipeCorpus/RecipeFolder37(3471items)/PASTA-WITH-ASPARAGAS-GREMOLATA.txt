Categories: Pasta/rice, Salsa/sauce, Low cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Asparagas, trimmed and cut
-diagonally into 1/4" slice
3/4 c  Reduced chicken broth
1/4 c  Olive oil
MMMMM-------------------------GREMOLATA------------------------------
-packed
Cooked pasta of your choice
12    2x1/2" strips orange zest
4 md Garlic cloves
2 tb Whole Italian parsley leaves
Put the orange zest, garlic, and parsley in a food processor fitted
with the metal blade. Pulse the machine several times, stopping to
scrape down the bowl, then process until finely chopped.
Bring the reduced broth to a boil in a saucepan. (To make reduced
broth, briskly boil 2 cups of broth until it evaporates to one cup.)
Set it aside, covered.
In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over moderate-to-high heat.
Saute the asparagas until tender-crisp, about 3 minutes.
Spoon the asparagas over freshly cooked pasta. Sprinkle with the
gremolata, then moisten with the hot broth.
Note: Use a small, sharp paring knife to cut the strips of zest very
carefully from an orange, making sure to remove none of the bitter
white pith.
