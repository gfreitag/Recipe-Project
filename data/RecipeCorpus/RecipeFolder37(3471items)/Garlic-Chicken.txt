regulator rocks gently; cook for 8 minutes.

Quick-release the pressure.  Carefully remove lid.  Transfer chicken

In a small mixing bowl stir together cornstarch and water; add to
cooker. Cook and stir till thickened and bubbly.  Spoon over chicken
and broccoli. Sprinkle with nuts.  If desired, garnish with sweet
pepper strips.  Makes 6 main-dish servings.
