MMMMM-------------------SPROUTING INFORMATION------------------------
You can purchase a sprouting jar (available at most health food
stores) or you can make your own. To make your own get a 1/2 gallon
clear glass container. Be sure to wash it out well. Cover the mouth
with a fine screen and use a rubber band to keep it on.  That's it.
Really though, the purchased jars are inexpensive and are made just
for the purpose.

** How to sprout seeds

1.) Place measured amount of seed, beans, or grain into sprouting
jar. Add water and soak overnight following chart recommendations
below.

2.)  Pour off soak water and place jar mouth down at 45 degree angle
for drainage and ventilation between rinsings, then rinse twice a day
with fresh cool water.

3.)  After sprouts have matured (see chart below) place them in a
bowl of water. Seed hulls will float to the top and dprouts will
sink. Skim hulls off with your hand and discard them. Gently remove
sprouts from bowl and drip drain before storing them in a glass or
plastic (closed) container or bag in the refridgerator.

4.)  Place Alfalfa, Mustard, Cabbage, Clover, and Radish in indirect
light for two days before harvesting to develop chlorophyll. Use the
sprouts in preparing your next meal, in salads and sandwiches.

** Sprouting tip

The ideal sprouting temperature is between 65~ and 75~. Sprouts
grow best in darkness or indirect light. When sprouted too long some
seeds and beans may become bitter. Grains become sweeter on the
fourth and fifth day of sprouting. Start new seeds every 3 days for a
continuous suppy.
