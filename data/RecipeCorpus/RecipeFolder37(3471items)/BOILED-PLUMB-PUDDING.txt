Title: BOILED PLUMB PUDDING
Categories: Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
1 tb Nutmeg
1 ts Ginger
Salt
1 lb Flour
1 pt Milk
1 lb Suet
1 lb Currants
1 lb Raisins
8    Egg
4    Egg white
6 c  Bread crumbs
Cut suet in little pieces.  Beat the eggs, then half the milk, beat
them together, and by degrees stir in the flour and bread together,
then the suet, spice and fruit, and as much milk as will mix it all
well together and very thick.

Wet a large muslin cloth (3 foot square) and rub with flour inside
and out. Drape it into a bowl large enough to hold the pudding mix.
Pour the mixture in and tie up the muslin ends tightly, leaving the
pudding in a large ball with some room for expansion. When tying the
neck, leave long enough ends on the cords so you can knot a loop.
Suspend the pudding in a large kettle or stock pot of boiling water,
hanging the loop from a long wooden spoon straddling the open top of
the pot, and boil five hours. Check water level frequently.  It
evaporates quickly.

When done, wrap in a clean muslin cloth and douse with 1/4 cup rum or
brandy.  Check weekly and add additional rum or brandy if it appears
dry.
