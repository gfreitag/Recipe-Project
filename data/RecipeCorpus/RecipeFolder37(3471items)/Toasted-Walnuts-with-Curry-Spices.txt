For cookie sheet
3/4 ts Curry powder

1. Mix spices in small bowl and set aside.

2. Place nut halves in dry cast-iron skillet over medium heat and
cook, stirring frequently, 4 to 5 minutes, just until the nuts begin
to sizzle and become fragrant. Add butter and stir until melted.  Add
spices and stir constantly until they are fragrant and begin to

using two forks to separate individual nuts. Let cool completely and
store.
