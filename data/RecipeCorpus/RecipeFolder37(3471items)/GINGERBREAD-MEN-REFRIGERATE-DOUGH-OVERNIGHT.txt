Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 48 servings
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1/2 ts Allspice
3/4 c  Dark molasses
1/3 c  Water
3 1/4 c  Sifted flour
Raisins
1/4 c  Unsalted butter, softened
1/2 c  Dark brown sugar, firmly p
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground ginger
Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream together butter and sugar.  Beat in the
baking
soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and allspice.  Mix well.  Stir
in the molasses, then add the water.  Gradually work the flour into
the batter,
1 cup at a time.
Knead the mixture into a smooth dough.  If the dough is sticky, add
more flour, a little at a time, until it is easier to work.  Divide
the dough into two equal parts.  Wrap each half in waxed paper and
refrigerate over- night.  Do not freeze.
The next day, preheat the oven to 350.  Lightly grease two large
baking sheet
with butter or vegetable shortening.
On a floured work survace, roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/4
inch. Cut out the cookies using a 3-inch-tall gingerbread man cookie
cutter. Place the cookies 1 inch apart on the baking sheets.  Create
the eyes and buttons with the raisins.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or
until the cookies have browned around the edges.  Remove from the
oven. After the cookies have cooled for 2 to 3 minutes, but are still
warm to the touch, use a spatula to transfer them to wire racks to
cool completely.
