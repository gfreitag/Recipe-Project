Title: Pan Oysters
Categories: Fish/seafoo, White house
Yield: 1 batch
MMMMM---------------------------RECIPE--------------------------------
Cut some stale bread in thin slices, taking off all the crust and cut
them to fit the bottom of ramekins.  Toast and butter the bread and
place them in the ramekins and moisten with three or four teaspoons
of oyster liquor; place on the toast a layer of oysters, sprinkle
with pepper, and put a small piece of butter on top of each pan;
place all the pans in a baking-pan and place in the oven, covering
tightly.  They will cook in seven or eight minutes if the oven is
hot; or, cook till the beards are ruffled;  remove the cover,
sprinkle lightly with salt, replace, and cook one minute longer.
Serve in the ramekins.  They are delicious.
