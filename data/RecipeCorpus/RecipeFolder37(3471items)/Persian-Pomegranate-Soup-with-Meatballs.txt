Categories: Soup/stew, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
Large stems removed
Leaves cut in 1" strips
1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
1 tb Sugar
3 tb Dried spearmint
2    Limes, cut in wedges
Warm pita bread
For serving
1 lb Lean ground lamb
2 md Onion(s), grated on
Coarse holes of box grater
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground allspice
Salt and pepper
1 c  Long-grain rice
2 c  Sour pomegranate juice *
1/4 lb Spinach
* Middle eastern groceries sell pomegranate syrup, also called
pomegranate molasses. In recipes calling for sour pomegranate juice,
dilute 1 tbs pomegranate syrup in 1 cup of warm water. Or use sweet
pomegranate juice, available at health food stores, soured with 1 tbs
strained fresh lemon or lime juice per cup of pomegranate juice.

1. In a large bowl, combine the lamb with the onions, cinnamon,
allspice, and  1/2 tsp each of salt and pepper. Mix well with your
hands. Roll teaspoons of the meat mixture into firm balls and place
on a lightly oiled platter; you will have about 50 meatball.

Can be refrigerated for up to 1 day or frozen for up to 1 week.

2. Pour 10 cups of cold water into a large saucepan. Add 1 1/2 tsp
salt and bring to a boil. Stir in the rice and return to a boil.
Reduce the heat to moderate and simmer for 5 min. Stir in the sour
pomegranate juice, spinach, parsley, sugar, and the meatballs and
bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderate and simmer, partially
covered, until the rice is tender and the meatballs are cooked
through, about 15 min.

3. Rub the mint between your fingers to form a fine powder. In a small
bowl, combine the mint with 1 tsp each of salt and pepper.

4. Ladle the soup into large bowls and top with a generous sprinkling
of the mint mixture. Serve the remaining mint on the side, along with
the lime wedge and pita bread.
