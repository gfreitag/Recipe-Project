Title: Spaghetti with Garlicky Bread Crumbs
Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 4 servings
Bread crumbs
1/4 c  Italian parsley, chopped
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Fresh ground pepper
1/2 lb Spaghetti
3 lg Garlic clove(s)
1/3 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 c  Italian seasoned
1. Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
tender, 8-9 min. Drain; leave some water clinging to the pasta.

2. Meanwhile, chop the garlic. In a large frying pan, heat the oil
over medium heat. Add the bread crumbs and cook, stirring often,
until the crumbs are golden and crisp, 2-3 min. Transfer to a small
bowl, leaving most of the oil in the pan.

3. Add the garlic to the frying pan and cook, stirring often, until
fragrant, about 2 min. Stir in the parsley, salt and pepper and
remove from the heat.

4. Add the pasta to the frying pan and toss. Add the bread crumbs and
toss well. Adjust seasonings and serve immediately.
