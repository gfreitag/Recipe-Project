Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
24 ea HALVED OYSTER SHELLS (WELL-C
1 pt FRESH, SHUCKED OYSTERS
~-----  VARIATION:
4 to 5 lb ROCK SALT
Note:  FRESH, SHUCKED OYSTERS (RINSED AND DRAINED, MAKE SURE ALL

To cook: Oysters are best baked using oyster shells, rock salt,
and pie pans to keep oysters hot when served. If shells and salt
are not available, use a jelly roll pan.
Spread rock salt to cover the bottoms of four 6-inch pie pans.
Place 6 oyster shells in each pan on top of rock salt. Place 1
oyster in each shell. If using jelly roll pan, spread oysters
should look a little dry. Remove from oven. Immediately cover
each oyster completely with lots of sauce (about 3 tablespoons
sauce per oyster). Bake in a 400 F oven for 15 to 20 minutes
until tops are brownish.
To serve: If using pie pans, place pan salt, and oysters on
heat-proof dinner dishes and serve immediately. Eat oysters and
sauce out of shell with a fork. If not using pie pans, place 6
oysters with sauce on each hot serving dish. Yields 24 oysters.
