MALAWACH
========
Malawach is one of a number of dishes brought to Israel by the Jews
from Yemen. The popularity of this versatile dish, which may be
served with a variety of fillings and toppings, testifies to the love
for Yemenite food which Israelis have acquired.

Mix flour, water, and salt until dough becomes soft.  Add more flour
if dough is sticky.  Cut dough into two sections.  Knead and roll
each section into a 20x20 inch sheet.  Spread margarine on the
sheets.  Fold each sheet like an envelope with ends meeting at
center.  Repeat folding process to get
two layers of folds.  Cover with a paper towel, let sit for 1/2 hour.
Cut each sheet into 10 parts.  Form each piece of dough to the shape
of your frying pan and fry until golden brown on both sides.  Serve
with tomato sauce or sour cream.
