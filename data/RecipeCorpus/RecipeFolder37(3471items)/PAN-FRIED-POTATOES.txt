Title: PAN FRIED POTATOES
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
2 ts Pepper
1    Large onion, sliced
1/2 c  Bacon drippings or oil
8    Medium potatoes
1 tb Paprika
2 ts Salt
Peel the potatoes and slice thinly.  Spread out on paper towels to
let dry.

Combine the paprika, salt and pepper.  In a large bowl, combine
potatoes, onion and the paprika mixture and toss well to coat with the
mixture.

In large, heavy skillet, heat bacon drippings over medium high
heat and add potatoes.  Stir with spatula to prevent potatoes from
breaking up and sticking. Cook until potatoes are tender and
well-browned, about 30 mins.

Enjoy! - Jeff Duke
