Coarsely chopped (3 cups)
3 tb Pine nuts

1 tb Grate fine-quality
Bittersweet chocolate

In a heavy 6-8-quart kettle heat oil over moderate heat until hot but
not smoking and brown oxtails on all sides, in batches if necessary,
transferring with a slotted spoon to a plate as browned. In kettle
cook onion, garlic, and cloves with salt and pepper to taste,

and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until meat is very tender
and falls away from the bones, 3 1/2-4 hours.

1 min and drain. Transfer about 2 cups oxtail sauce from kettle to a
small saucepan and add celery, pine nuts, raisins, and chocolate.
Simmer sauce 5 min.

Transfer oxtails with a slotted spoon to a platter, reserving sauce in
kettle for another use if desired, and spoon celery sauce over them.
