KICHLACH
========
In Israel, all young men and women are required to enlist for military
service at the age of 18.  The soldiers, who manage to get home only
once every several weeks, enjoy getting parcels with sweet things
from home; and mothers are very efficient in keeping them
well-supplied with cakes. Derived from central Europe, the popular
kichlach are to be found in many of
the packages destined for young soldiers.  No adequate substitute has
so far
been found for the homemade product.  The word kichlach is Yiddish for
cookies.

Beat eggs until light, then beat in oil, sugar, flour and salt.  Beat
until very smooth.  Stir in poppy seeds, if you desire.  Drop by the
teaspoon onto
a greased baking sheet, leaving about 3 inches between each (they
spread and
puff while baking).  Bake at 325 deg F (170 deg C) for 15 minutes or
until browned on the edges. Makes approximately 36 cookies.
