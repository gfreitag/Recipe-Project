Title: Sugar Cookies Frosting (1950)
Categories: Cake/cookie, Oldies
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Vanilla
1 tb Cream
1/3 c  Butter or margarine
2 c  Sifted confectioner's sugar
1    Egg yolk
Cream butter or margarine and sugar.  Add remaining ingredients and
stir until mixture is thick and creamy.  If a thicker frosting is
desired for pastry tube decorations, additional sifted confectioner's
sugar may be added.

The illustrations show a row of weirdly pin-headed gingerbread persons
in sugar overalls, and a fetching plateful of bells, boots, wreaths,
and what might be intended to be reindeer.
