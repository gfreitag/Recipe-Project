Title: CROSTINI DI LENTICCHIE
Categories: Italian, Breads, Appetizers
Yield: 1 servings
3 1/2 c  Chicken broth
1/4 ts Crumbled basil
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
1 sm Bay leaf
Toasted Italian bread
Grated Fontina cheese
2 tb Good olive oil
1 md Onion, chopped
2    Ribs celery, chopped
1 sm Carrot, grated
1    Clove garlic, minced
1/2    Red bell pepper, chopped
1 1/2 c  Lentils
In a large sauce pan heat oil and saute chopped veggies until lightly
browned, about 7 minutes.  Add lentils and broth and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and add basil, salt, pepper and bay leaf. Simmer until
lentils are very soft, about 50 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and
puree in a food processor until very smooth. Let cool to room temp.
Mound on lightly toasted Italian bread and sprinkle with Fontina (if
you want a little color, a strip of roasted red pepper looks good).
Run under a preheated broiler until cheese is melted and bubbly. The
lentil puree keeps well, bring to room temp if refrigerated.
