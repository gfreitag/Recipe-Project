Title: WINE GLAZED ORANGES
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
-small pieces
1 sm Piece dried ginger root
4 lg Oranges
Grated orange peel (opt)
Half-and-half
1/2 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Water
3/4 c  Red wine
4    Whole cloves
2 ts Cassia bark, broken in
In a saucepan, combine sugar and water and heat slowly, stirring to
dissolve sugar. Add wine, cloves, cassia bark and ginger. Bring to a
boil and boil until slightly thickened and syrupy. Cool 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, using a sharp knife, peel oranges, removing all bitter
white pith. Cut oranges in 1/4"-thick slices and place in a shallow
dish. Strain wine syrup over oranges. Cover and chill several hours
or overnight, turning slices occasionally in syrup.

Using wooden picks, secure orange slices together to form whole
oranges and place in a serving dish. Pour wine syrup over oranges.
Garnish with orange peel, if desired, and serve with half-and-half.

NOTE: If desired, serve oranges in slices rather than as whole
oranges.
