MMMMM--------------------------PUDDING-------------------------------
1 tb Flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 c  Pecans, chopped
1/4 ts Salt
6 oz Chocolate, semi-sweet
6    Eggs
1 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 c  Flour
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
3 tb Raspberry liqueur
2 ts Lemon juice
2 c  Raspberries
1/4 c  Sugar
Generously butter inside of 8-c steamed pudding mold or Bundt pan.
Dust with sugar, tapping out excess. Generously butter inside of lid.
Chop chocolate and melt in double boiler over hot, not simmering,
water. Remove from heat and cool until tepid.

Separate eggs.  Beat yolks and sugar on high about 3 minutes, until
mixture is pale yellow and forms a thick ribbon when beaters are
lifted. Beat in cooled chocolate and vanilla. Mix flour, baking
powder, and baking soda, and beat into chocolate mixture just until
mixed. Stir in pecans.

Beat egg whites with clean dry beaters in clean dry bowl at low speed
until foamy.  Add salt, increase speed to high, and continue beating
until they begin to form stiff peaks. Stir 1/4 of whites into
chocolate mixture to lighten, then farefully fold in remaining
whites. Pour batter into prepared pan. Cover with lid or aluminum
foil.

Place covered mold in large pot, and add enough boiling water to come
halfway up sides of mold.  Cover pot tightly and bring to boil over
high heat.  Reduce heat to low and steam pudding, keeping watter
simmering at all times and adding water as necessary, until toothpick
inserted in center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
Transfer pudding to wire cake rack and cool 5 minutes.

Puree raspberries, sugar, liqueur, and lemon juice. Strain to remove
seeds. Slice pudding into wedges and serve warm with sauce.
