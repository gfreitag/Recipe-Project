Title: FLAESKESTEG MED SVAER (ROAST HAM WITH CRACKLING)
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
Coarse salt or regular salt
Fresh ground black pepper
1/2    Fresh ham (butt or shank)
-weighing about 6 lb. -=OR=-
6 lb Shoulder of pork w/rind on
Preheat oven to 300øF. Using a sharp, heavy knife, cut deeply through
the rind and fat until you reach the meat, making the incisions 1/2"
apart lengthwise and crosswise. Rub salt and pepper liberally into
these gashes. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the
ham and place it on a rack set in a shallow roasting pan just large
enough to hold the meat comfortably. Roast slowly 4 to 4 1/2 hours or
until the meat thermometer reads 180øF. Do not baste the meat. When
roasted, the meat should be moist and tender and the rind (or
crackling) very crisp. Let the roast rest outside the oven for 10-15
minutes for easier carving. A little of the crackling should be
included in each serving of meat.
