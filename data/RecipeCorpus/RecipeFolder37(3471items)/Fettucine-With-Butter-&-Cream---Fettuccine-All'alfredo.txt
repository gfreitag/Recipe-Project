Prepare noodles using Basic Egg Pasta Dough (made with 2-1/4 cup
all-purpose flour)
Melt butter in a large skillet.  When butter foams, add cream.  Simmer
over medium heat about 2 minutes until slightly thickened.  Season
with salt and white pepper.  Fill a very large saucepan two-thirds
full with salted water.  Bring water to a boil.  Add noodles.  Bring
water back to a boil and cook noodles uncovered until tender, but
firm to bite.  Drain noodles and place in skillet with cream.  Add
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Toss noodles and sauce over medium heat
until sauce coats noodles, 20 to 30 seconds.  Serve immediately with
additional Parmesan cheese.  Makes 4 to 6 servings.
