Title: STREUSEL PLUM CAKE
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 5 servings
1/4 c  Packed brown sugar
1/2 tb Soft margarine
1/2 ts Cinnamon
GLAZE (optional)
2 tb Icing sugar
1/2 ts 2% milk
1/8 ts Vanilla
2 tb Margarine
6 tb Granulated sugar
1    Egg, separated
3/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 c  2% milk
1 c  Halved plums or other fruit
STREUSEL TOPPING
Grease 8" square cake pan, 9" pie plate or springform pan.

Beat egg white in a small bowl and set aside.  In large bowl, cream
together margarine, sugar and egg yolk until fluffy. Combine flour and
baking powder, beat into egg mixture alternately with milk. Fold
beaten egg white into batter.

Turn into prepared pan.  Halve plums (or slice peach, apple, pear,
nectarine) and arrange over top.

Streusel topping:  in a small bowl, combine brown sugar, margarine and
cinnamon.  Mix well and sprinkle over fruit.

Bake at 350 F for about 35 minutes or until top is golden and
toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean. Time depends on
thickness of batter.

Glaze:  Combine icing sugar, milk and vanilla.  Mix well. Drizzle over
cake.

My notes:  original recipe halved makes 5 servings, but it tasted so
good warm that we only cut 4 servings. Warmed up in microwave for the
second meal. Use extra fruit (fresh or canned) to make 6 servings.
Would be nice served at a brunch - moist but not too sweet. Tested
with fresh nectarines!
