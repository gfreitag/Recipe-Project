Title: TARTE TATIN (A 'REVERSED' APPLE PIE)
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 6 servings
2 kg Apples (4 3/8 lb), peeled,
-- cored, cuted in halves
300 g  Puff pastry (2/3 lb
200 g  Sugar (7 oz)
100 g  Butter (3 1/2 oz)
For a 26 cm (10.2 in) diameter pie form

Roll out the pastry ( 2 mm, 1/10 in, thick) to a 30 cm (11.8 in) disc
and leave it to rest in the refrigerator.

Pre-heat the oven to 220 oC (435 oF).

Butter a 26cm-diameter disc of baking parchment and carefully line
the base of the tin with it. Spread the sugar over the paper, shaking
it evenly over the surface, place in the middle of the oven and bake
for some 8 minutes to caramelize the sugar. Keep care !! Caramelize
to light golden brown !! Then add the butter, let it melt, tttooto
and leave to cool a little.

(You can try without baking parchment: it's difficult to unmold !!)

Place the halved apples vertically side by side (i.e. they MUST be
higher than the rim of the tin !). Bake for some 25 minutes (at the
same temperature), tttooto.

'Line' (i.e. cover) the apples with the pastry disc . Bake for 20 ...
25 minutes (at the same temperature), tttooto.

Let cool 5 minutes on a rack, then turn over and unmold the 'tarte
tatin' on a plate, remove the baking parchment.

The 'tarte tatin' look now like an apple pie :-)

Serving: warm or lukewarm with 'creme chantilly'

(tttooto = take the tin out of the oven !!)
