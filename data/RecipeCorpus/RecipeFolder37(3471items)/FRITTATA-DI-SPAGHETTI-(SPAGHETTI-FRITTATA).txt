Title: FRITTATA DI SPAGHETTI (SPAGHETTI FRITTATA)
Categories: Pasta/rice, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 c  Basil or parsley; chopped
2 c  Cooked spaghetti;
1 1/2 c  Mozzarella or other cheese;
-cubed (about 6 oz)
1/4 c  Olive oil;
4 tb Butter;
1 ts Olive oil;
4 sl Prosciutto or ham; diced
-about 1/4 lb
6 lg Eggs;
3 tb Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese;
x  Salt & pepper to taste;
In a frying pan, saute the prosciutto or ham in the olive oil until
crispy. Drain on brown paper. (I used paper towels) In a large bowl,
beat the eggs. Add the Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and pepper, and
basil or parsley. Add the spaghetti and mix well, then stir in the
mozzarella cheese and proscuitto. In a 9-inch frying pan, heat 2T of
the butter and 2T of the olive oil. Add the spaghetti mixture and
smooth the top with a spatula. Cook over medium-low heat until the
frittata is browned on the bottom and set. Invert a plate larger than
the frying pan over the pan and turn out the frittata. Heat the
remaining butter and olive oil in the pan, and return the frittata to
the pan to brown the other side. Shake the pan occasionally to keep
the frittata from sticking.  Invert a serving plate over the frying
pan and carefully turn out the frittata. Serve at room temperature,
cut in wedges. (like a pie)

NOTE:  This is even better the day after it is made. (She's not
kidding) My Note:  It doesn't usually last in my house till the next
day.<BG>
