Title: STU'S OLD ENGLISH PRIME RIB
Categories: Main dish, Meats
Yield: 1 servings
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
Rock salt (ice cream salt)
1/2 lb Prime rib (per person)
1 ts MSG powder
1 ts Paprika
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
Rub seasoning into meat. In a large roaster(not aluminum) pour a
layer of rock salt until bottom of pan is completely covered. Lightly
dampen the rock salt with water until salt is just moist. Place the
meat onto the salt in a standing rib position. Then cover prime rib
completely with rock salt and dampen with water. DO NOT cover the
roaster. Place in preheated oven at 500 degrees. Roast 15 to 18 per
pound (rare 15 minutes). When cooking time is completed, remove
roast. Break rock salt away from meat with a hammer (hard seal formed)

NOTE: DO NOT use any powder rock salt. I filter the rock salt with
colander. Use only that rock salt that does not sift through the
colander.

Prime rib cooked this way becomes fork tender.

Enjoy
