Title: Swiss Steak
Categories: Meats
Yield: 3 servings
1/2 ts Pepper
2 md Onions, sliced
1    Green pepper, sliced
1 cn Tomatoes
4 tb Shortening
3 lb Steak, 1 1/2 inches thick
1/2 c  Flour
2 ts Salt
Melt shortening, I use an electric skillet.  Mix seasonings with
flour. Pat or pound well into the steak.  Brown the steak in
shortening.  Add onions, green pepper and tomatoes.  Cook on high
heat until steaming with cover on.  Reduce to low heat and cook 1 3/4
hours.  Many times I have omitted the onions, green pepper and
tomatoes and just covered the meat, after browning, with water.  This
makes its own excellent gravy, turn the meat from time to time, add
water if necessary.
