LOKSHEN KUGEL

Lokshen Kugel means "noodle pudding" in Yiddish.  It originated in
eastern Europe where the Jewish community spoke that language.  This
item falls into
the category of "grandma's dishes."

Cook noodles as directed on the package; drain well.  Stir in
remaining ingredients and half of the melted margarine.  Place in a
greased casserole and pour over the remaining melted margarine.  Bake
uncovered at 350 deg F (180 deg C) for 1 hour.
