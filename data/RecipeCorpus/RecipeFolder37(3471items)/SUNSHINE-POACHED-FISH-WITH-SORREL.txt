"I springboarded this recipe off another using Tilapia, delicious and
inexpensive fish farmed in Florida and elsewhere. Not having any
sorrel I used spinach and this made for a quick, easy and wonderful
dinner."

Saute shallots and leek in 1 ts olive oil lightly or until just
clear. Add orange juice and white wine. Bring to boil.

Sprinkle fish very lightly with salt and pepper and nestle into pan.
Lower heat, cover and poach 4 minutes. Add chopped sorrel or spinach,
cover and poach another 4 minutes (approximately 8 minutes total
should be enough).

Remove fish and spinach to warm plates. Thicken sauce with arrowroot
dissolved in white wine and serve with saffron rice.
