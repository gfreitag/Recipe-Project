Info help
1. Place the material to be cooked in the cooker.  Fill no more than
half full of food and water.  Remember to use fresh water, not the
soaking water.

2. Add at least 1 Tablespoon oil to prevent the contents from foaming
up when they begin to boil, and any seed coats from clogging the
steam valve.

3. Place the cover on securely.

4. Heat to boiling.  Let steam escape for one minute.

5. Place the cover on securely.

6. Set the cooker on high heat until the pressure regulator begins to
rock gently.  Start counting cooking time.

7. Reduce heat to maintain a slow, steady, rocking motion of the
pressure regulator.

8. Cook the beans until tender.  Recommended cooking times are only
approximate because the age of the bean, soaking time, water
hardness, type of bean, etc... The following are recommended cooking
times.

a) Hardest Beans: Soybean

At  15-lb pressure--25-30 minutes

b) Hard beans:  great northerns
kidney beans
whole Peas
red beans
black beans
garbonzos (chickpeas)
brown beans

At 15-lb pressure--cook for 10-15 minutes

c) Soft Beans
lima beans
pink beans
pinto beans
navy beans

At 15-lb pressure--cook for 10 minutes

d) Softest Beans
split peas
black eyed peas
lentils
(soaking unecessary)
At 15-lb pressure--cok for 6-10 minutes

If your pressure cooker only goes to 10-lbs, double cooking times.

9. At the end of the cooking period, or if you want to check beans,
totally reduce the pressure by turning off heat and releasing
pressure valve. There is less risk of skin breakage if pressure
releases slowly. As soon as the pressure has completely dropped, and
no more steam is escaping from release valve remove the cover.
