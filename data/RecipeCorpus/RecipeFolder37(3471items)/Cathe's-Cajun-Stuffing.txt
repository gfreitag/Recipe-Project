Title: Cathe's Cajun Stuffing
Categories: Main dish, Holiday
Yield: 1 batch
-de-veined, but not cooked
2 3/4 c  Water
1 ts Garlic flakes (dried)
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper flakes
-(crushed), or more to
-taste (we use about 1 T)
1 pk Pepperidge Farm Cornbread
-stuffing mix (cellophane
-bag, brown-labelled)
1 pk Pepperidge Farm Herb
-Stuffing Mix (cellophane
-bag, blue-labelled)
1 lb Jimmy Dean sage sausage
1 lg Bell pepper, chopped
-into 1/4" to 1/2" pieces
Green onions (large bunch),
-cut into 1/4" thick pieces
Parsley (1/3 bunch), fresh,
-chopped finely
2 md Celery stalks, cut
-lengthwise into 3 sticks,
-then cut into pieces
-1/4" thick
1/2 c  Butter
1 lb Shrimp, peeled and
In a large pot or Dutch oven (at least 6-quart),cook the sausage over
medium heat until lightly-browned, breaking it up into small pieces.
Saute the vegetables in the sausage drippings in the pot with the
cooked sausage. The vegetables will brown lightly while the sausage
gets browner than it was. Add the butter to the pot and stir the
pieces around until they are melted.

Add the shrimp and cook for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring constantly.  The
shrimp should turn pink all over and be done, but just barely done.
Break one in half and make sure it is opaque in the center. Turn the
heat off, but leave the pot on the burner. Add the 2 3/4 C water, the
dried garlic and the cayenne pepper flakes; stir well.

Add both bags of stuffing mix to the liquid mixture.  Blend all
ingredients together well.  Lightly spoon the stuffing mixture into a
greased 9" x 14" pan.  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 15 minutes.  Serve
at once (with Burgundy mushroom gravy, if desired).
