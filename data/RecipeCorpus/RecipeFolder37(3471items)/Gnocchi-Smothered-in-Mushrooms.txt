Title: Gnocchi Smothered in Mushrooms
Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 2 servings
1 tb Thyme, chopped
1/2 c  Marsala or port wine
1 lb Frozen potato gnocchi
1 lb Assorted mushrooms
6 tb Butter
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi and
stir gently. When the gnocchi float to the top, after about 2 min,
scoop them out and place them in a bowl. Cover to keep warm.

2. Meanwhile, thinly slice the mushrooms. Melt 3 tbs of butter in a
large frying pan over medium-high heat until bubbly but not brown.
Add the mushrooms and toss to coat with the butter. Add the chopped
thyme. Cook, tossing, until the mushrooms are tender, 4-5 min. Add
the marsala and boil, stirring constantly, until the liquid is
reduced by half, about 2 min.

3. Whisk the remaining 3 tbs butter into the mushrooms and toss the
sauce gently with the drained gnocchi.
