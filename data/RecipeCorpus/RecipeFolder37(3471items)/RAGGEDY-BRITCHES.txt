6 c  Flour; sifted
6    Egg whites; stiffly beaten
- Hot oil for frying
- Powdered Sugar
1 c  Butter; softened
2 c  Sugar
6    Egg yolks; lightly beaten
2    Whole nutmegs; grated
2    Lemons; grated rind only
Cream together the butter and sugar, slowly add egg yolks, nutmeg and
lemon rind.  Stir this mixture into sifted flour and fold in the
stiffly beaten egg whites. The dough will be soft but manageable. If
too soft,  cover the bowl and chill for several hours. Roll out small
amounts of the dough at a time on a floured board, keeping the rest
chilled until ready to  use. Roll dough about 1/4 inch thick and cut
into strips 1 X 6". Fold the strips in half and twist them several
times, twisting them together.
Fry until golden brown in oil heated to 375 degrees F. When done,
remove from oil and drain on paper towels.  Dust generously with
sifted powdered sugar.  Keep fresh in a covered tin. Make 7 dozen.
