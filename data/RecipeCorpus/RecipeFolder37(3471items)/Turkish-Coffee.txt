TURKISH COFFEE

Turkish coffee seems to taste best when prepared in the traditional
feenjan,
but a deep saucepan will do, sized according to how many cups you
wish to make.  Feenjans can be bought in Eastern specialty shops--the
pot is wide at
the bottom, narrow toward the top, and has a long handle.  Turkish
coffee should be served in small cylindrical cups; espresso cups are
suitable.

The drinking of Turkish coffee has become part of the national
folklore in Israel.  Songs have even been composed about the coffee
and its feenjan pot.
Drinking it at the end of a meal or at any other time is a
well-established custom in Israel as it is in all parts of the
Orient.  In fact, in Israel, coffee is the most popular beverage.
When peace finally comes to the region, there is no doubt that the
historic event will be marked by the drinking of cups of Turkish
coffee.

spice shops)
1 tsp. sugar (more or less depending on taste)
cardamom pods to taste

Thoroughly mix coffee and sugar in a feenjan or a saucepan.  Add
boiling water (the measure of a serving cup plus a little more), stir
well.  Add cardamom pods (experiment to achieve desired taste) and
bring coffee to a boil.  When the foam on top begins to rise, remove
coffee from heat until it
settles and repeat process.  Pour into a coffee cup, spooning in some
foam. The coffee grounds will sink to the bottom of the cup; do not
stir them up. Serve immediately.  Multiply this recipe by whatever
number is required for more than one cup and proceed as above.
