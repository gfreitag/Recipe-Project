Title: Gratin of Penne w/Roquefort and Herbes de Provence
Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 6 servings
2 ts Herbes de Provence
Salt and pepper
2 c  Crumbled Roquefort cheese
(about 1/2 lb)
1 lb Penne
1 pk (16 oz) frozen
Italian-style vegetables
1 c  Heavy cream
1. Preheat the broiler. Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling,
salted water until tender but still firm, 8-10 min. About 5 min into
cooking time, add the vegetables to the water and continue cooking
until the pasta is done. Drain well.

2. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, bring the cream to a boil over
high heat. Reduce heat to medium and add the herbes de Provence. Boil
the cream, stirring occasionally, until it thickens, 6-8 min. Season
with salt and pepper to taste.

3. Toss the pasta and vegetables with the seasoned cream and the
crumbled Roquefort cheese. Spoon into a 15-inch gratin dish and place
under the broiler. Broil until bubbly and lightly browned, 1-2 min.
