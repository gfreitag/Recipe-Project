Title: Blistered String Beans with Pork
Categories: Vegetables, Chinese
Yield: 1 batch
2 tb Szechuan mustard green
1/4 c  Chicken broth
1/4 c  Water
1 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Sesame oil
3 c  Oil
2 lb String beans
3/4 lb Ground pork
1/2 tb Dried shrimp
4 tb Dry sherry
Rinse the beans and break off the ends; dry them thoroughly to reduce
spattering during deep-frying.  Rinse and mince the Szechuan mustard
green.

Wash the dried shrimp and soak them in sherry for 1 hour.  Drain them,
reserving the sherry.  Mince the shrimp.

Mix the sherry from the shrimp with the chicken broth, water, soy
sauce and sesame oil.  Reserve.

Heat the oil in a wok (or deep pan) until a bamboo chopstick sizzles
when put into the oil.  Deep fry the beans in 5 or 6 batches, until
they develop brown blisters and shrivel slightly. Remove them batch
by batch; drain each batch and keep them warm while you remove all
but 2 T oil from the pan.

Heat the 2 T of oil until very hot and add the ground pork.  Stir fry
until it is broken up into very small pieces and no longer is pink.
Add the minced shrimp and Szechuan mustard green.  Stir for 30
seconds. Add the string beans and stir to mix well for about 15
seconds.

Add the liquid ingredients, toss until the liquid is reduced to 2
tablespoons.  Serve on a warmed platter.
