"When they're tired of B.C. salmon, they're tired of life," says
Defence Minister Kim Campbell , paraphrasing 18th century British
writer, Samuel Johnson. Being from Vancouver, it's not surprising
that salmon is her favorite food." (Kim Campbell is one of the front
runners of the Conservative leadership candidates, the winner who
will be Canada's next prime minister.)

Combine shallots, salmon, wine and water in frying pan large enough
to hold fillets in a single layer. Cover and bring liquid to just a
simmer. Poach salmon about 2 minutes per side. Remove and keep warm.
Reserve stock for sauce.

Sauce: In a saucepan, bring shallots, stock, wine and lemon juice to a
boil. Cook till liquid is reduced by half. Strain. Cut butter into
small cubes. whisk into mixture one piece at a time. Do not let boil.
Season with dill, salt and pepper. Serve warm. Serve with asparagus.
