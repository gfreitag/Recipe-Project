Title: POTATO LATKES FOR HANUKKAH
Categories: Vegetables, Holiday, Ethnic
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper, white
1/4 c  Oil
4    Potatoes
1    Onions
1    Eggs
2 tb Matzoh meal
Peel potatoes and place in cold water until ready to prepare latkes.
Starting with onions, alternately grate some onions on large holes of
grater and some potatoes on smallest holes. This will keep potato
mixture from blackening.  (Or use food processor.  The steel blade
produces a smooth textured latke and the grating disk a crunchy one.)

Press out as much liquid as possible and reserve starchy sediment at
bottom of bowl.  Return sediment to mixture, but not liquid. Blend
potatoes with eggs, matzoh meal, salt, and white pepper.

Heat 1" of oil in frying pan.  Drop about 1 tb mixture for each latke
into skillet and fry, turning once. When golden and crisp on each
side, drain on paper towels. Serve with yogurt, sour cream, sugar, or
applesauce.
