1.If your souffle come out lookinglike a crushed top hat, or your
pizza crust
turns out soggy, don't despair.  The solution could be as simple as
repositioning the racks in your oven.
2.Foods such as souffles, which rely on intense heat to bake and reach
their
maximum volume, bake best in the upper third of the oven.  Set the
oven rackon the second highest position to allow the souffle enough
room to expand
to its fullest height.
3.Other foods, such as pizza crusts, pies and slow cooking
casseroles,fare better in the bottom third of the oven, with the oven
rack set on the second
lowest setting.
4.When baking two trays simultaneously, either of cookies, cakes or
buns,be sure to bake one tray on the middle rack and the other tray
on the next lowest rung. Baking two trays on the same level placed
next to each other obstructs the heat flow and produces uneven or
underbaked cookies. For best results, always switch rack postitions
halfway through the baking time.
