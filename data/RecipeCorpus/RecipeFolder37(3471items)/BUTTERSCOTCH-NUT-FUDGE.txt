Categories: Desserts, Candies
Yield: 12 servings
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
Walnut halves
1/4 c  Butter
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Sour cream
Melted brown sugar and sour cream gives this fudge its unusually good
flavor. Melt butter in a heavy saucepan. Add brown sugar and heat to
boiling. Add sugar and sour cream. Cook over medium heat until sugar
dissolves, then slightly higher heat to 236 degrees F. Without
stirring cool at room temperature to lukewarm. Beat until mixture
holds its shape and loses its gloss. Quickly add vanilla and nuts.
Spread immediately in a buttered 8-inch square pan. Cool and cut into
squares. Garnish with walnut halves. Makes about 49 pieces.
