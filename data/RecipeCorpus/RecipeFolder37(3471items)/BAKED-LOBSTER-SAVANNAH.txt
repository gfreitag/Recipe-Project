Preparation Time: 1:00
NOTE: If you are using lobsters smaller than three pounds each, you
will need enough smaller lobsters to produce a total of about 8 cups
of meat after boiling and cooling.

STEP ONE: The Sauce-- Heat butter to melting point in a large
saucepan, add mushrooms and green pepper. Cook until tender. Add
paprika and stir in sherimientos and blend well. Bring to a simmer.

STEP TWO: The Lobster-- This can be done while vegetables are cooking.
ReCut in a large dice.

CHEF'S NOTE: Discard intestinal vein and stomach--a hard sac near the
head--before dicing.

STEP THREE: Add meat to sauce and simmer slowly for 10 minutes. Divide
mixture evenly and spoon back into lobster shell. Dust with grated
parmesan cheese and brown in a 375-degree oven for 15 minutes. Serve.
