Title: SALSA PESTO
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese - grated
1/4 c  Pine nuts - toasted
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts White pepper
2 c  Fresh basil leaves -
-loosely packed
1/4 c  Onions - chopped
2 tb Garlic - chopped
1/2 lb Butter - softened
1.  Pick through basil and remove large stems and bad leaves.  Chop
basil fine in food processor.  Add onions and garlic to the
processor
bowl and puree.  Set aside in a large bowl.
2.  Put one stick of butter into the processor and give it a whirl.
Add half the olive oil, followed by another stick of butter,
followed
by the other half of the olive oil, blending well as you go
until you
have a thick liquid.
3.  Pour butter-oil mixture into the bowl with the basil puree.  Add
Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.  Stir well until completely
blended.
NOTE: When making pasta with pesto, put hot cooked pasta into a
skillet over medium heat.  Spoon four tablespoons of pesto sauce
over
the pasta and, with a kitchen fork, toss and blend with the pasta.
The
sauce will break if you put it into the skillet first - always stif
the sauce into the pasta rather than vice-versa.
Makes 3 cups - enough for 12 servings.
Chef Andrea Apuzzo says, "Pesto sauce - green and aromatic - is a
rich, herbal concoction which has seemingly endless uses.  Once you
make it, you will find yourself putting it not only in pasta (the
classic pesto employment), but also in soups, on top of chicken,
with
fish, and lots of other things.  We make a pesto butter sauce - not
really traditional, but most delicious.
