1. Cook the fettuccine in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
tender but still firm, 8-9 min. Drain well.

2. Meanwhile, combine the roasted peppers and tomatoes with their
juice in a blender or food processor. Remove the colored zest from
the orange with a zester or vegetable peeler and add it to the
peppers and tomatoes. Cut the orange in half crosswise and squeeze
its juice into the blender. Crush the garlic through a press into the
blender.

3. Puree all the ingredients in the blender until smooth. Transfer to
a medium saucepan, cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Reduce the heat to medium and simmer about 8 min, until the sauce has
thickened slightly and the flavors are combined. Season to taste with
salt and pepper.

4. Toss the fettuccine with the sauce and serve hot.
