Title: Egg Nog, Little House Style
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Beverages
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 ts Freshly ground nutmeg
6    Eggs, separated
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1 qt Homogenized milk
Beat the egg yolks and sugar in the bowl until thoroughly blended.
Slowly beat in the milk, then stir in the cream. Refrigerate this
mixture while you beat the egg whites on the platter until they stick
to it and form soft peaks. Pour the cold egg-milk mixture into the
milk pail or punch bowl and scrape the egg whites onto the surface,
blending some with a few deep strokes of the spoon. Sprinkle the
nutmeg over the foamy surface and carefully dip into cups so as not
to disturb the foam.
