Title: RISOTTO ALLA MILANESE
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 5 servings
1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
1/4 c  Marsala; or white wine
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
1/2 ts Black pepper
2 tb Butter
5 c  Chicken stock
pn Saffron threads
3 tb Olive oil
1/3 c  Onion; minced
2 tb Prosciutto; finely diced
In a medium saucepan, bring the stock to a simmer and crumble in
the saffron.  Maintain at a simmer over moderately low heat.
In a large nonreactive saucepan or flameproof casserole, heat the
oil over
moderate heat.  Add onion and prosciutto and cook until the onion is
softened
and translucent, about 2 minutes.
Add the rice and stir for 1-2 minutes until well coated with oil
and slightly translucent.  Add the Marsala and cook, stirring until it
evaporates.
Add 1/2 cup of the simmering stock and cook, stirring constantly,
until the rice is almost tender but still slightly crunchy in the
center, 20-25 minutes.
Add cheese and season with the pepper and salt to taste.  Continue
to cook, stirring and adding stock as necessary, 1/4 cup at a time,
until the rice is tender but still firm and is bound with a creamy
sauce 3-6 minutes longer.  Stir in butter and serve hot.
