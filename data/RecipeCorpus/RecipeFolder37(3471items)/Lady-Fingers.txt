Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts, Oldies
Yield: 30 servings
2    Egg yolks
1/4 ts Vanilla
1/3 c  Pastry flour
3    Egg whites
1/8 ts Salt
1/3 c  Powdered sugar
Add the salt to the egg whites and beat them until they are stiff and
dry. Fold in the sugar gradually. Then add the yolks, beaten until
they are thick and lemon colored. Add the flavoring. Cut and fold in
the flour which has been measured after sifting once. Shape about
4-1/2 inches long and 3/4 inch wide on the bottom of a pan covered
with unbuttered paper. Lady Finger pans may be used for baking, or
shaping can be facilitated by the use of a pastry bag and tube. Bake
at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.
