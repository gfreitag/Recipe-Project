Title: PARSNIP, CHICKEN AND ORANGE SOUP
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1 3/4 l  Chicken stock (3 pints)
1 ts Salt
2    Oranges, juice
Black pepper, freshly
-- grounded
2    Onions, peeled and choped
3 tb Olive oil
10    Cloves garlic, halved
8    Parsnips, either fresh or
-- pre-roasted
Soften the onions in the oil in a heavy covered pan. After 10 minutes
add the garlic cloves, then the peeled and sliced parsnips, reserving
any which have already been roasted to add later (*).

Cook all the vegetables together for 10 to 15 minutes until they are
soft, stirring them occasionally and adding any pre-roasted parsnips
a few minutes before the end.

Strain the hot stock into the vegetable mixture, add the salt and some
freshly ground black pepper, simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, then
liquidize.

Taste for seasoning and add the juice of the freshly squeezed orange.

(*) Parsnips give of their full sweetness only when roasted and can
taste overbearingly rank when cooked in other ways.
