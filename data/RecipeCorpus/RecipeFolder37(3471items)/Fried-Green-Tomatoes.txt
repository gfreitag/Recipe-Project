Marjorie's Note:  It was suggested on the echo to fry in bacon
drippings instead of shortening.

Joan Mershon said:  I'll tell you how to fry anything
"southern"...it's really very easy.  Take cornmeal, and Cavendar's
Greek Seasoning. Mix in enough seasoning until it looks like it has
"enough" pepper.  The amounts will vary depending on how much stuff
you are frying.  This works with green tomatoes, catfish, etc.  I
lived down south for many years and they use basically the same
thing, although they use the individual spices.
To cook the tomatoes, cut the green tomatoes into slices at least 1cm
thick, put cornmeal mixture in a plastic bag add a handful of
tomatoes seal and shake.  Plop into HOT grease (lard if you want
*real* authentic, shortening is the modern choice) and fry quickly
until brown.  Drain on paper towels and serve.

Earl Shelsby said:  Just flour, salt and pepper is what I grew up
eating. Bacon grease adds to the flavor. You might want to add either
rosemary or thyme to the seasoning, if you like those tastes.
