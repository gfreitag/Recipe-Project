Title: IRISH BARMBRACK BREAD
Categories: Breads, Scot/irish
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-----------------------1 1/2 LB LOAF----------------------------
3/4 ts Ground allspice
1 1/2 tb Butter
2 tb Dry milk
2 ts Red Star Active Dry Yeast
3/4 c  Raisins
1 1/8 c  Water
3 c  Bread flour
3 ts Gluten
1 1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Sugar
3/4 ts Dried lemon peel
Put all ingredients in bread pan in order of manufacturer directions.

This makes a dense medium size loaf (6-7 inches tall).  For a fluffier
taller loaf, increase yeast to 2 1/2 teaspoons.

Have ingredients at room temperature.  If necessary, warm water and
butter in microwave for 50-60 seconds on high.

For my Hitachi 101 add 1/4 cup raisins 4 minutes into first cycle.
Add remaining raisins just after resting period and as second
kneading begins.

Crust color: medium Bread Cycle: Bread or Mix Bread

This has been a successful loaf in my Hitachi B101.  Other makes of
bread machines will have to make some changes according to their own
machines.

According to a close Irish friend, this does taste and look like the
bread that she grew up with in Ireland.
