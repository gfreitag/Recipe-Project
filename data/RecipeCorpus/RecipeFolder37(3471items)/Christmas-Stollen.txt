1/2 c  Unsalted butter
1/4 c  Water

water in a saucepan and heat over low heat until warm (120-130
degrees) stirring until the butter melts.  Gradually add the warm milk

eggs, and 1 cup flour and beat 2 minutes longer.  Add the candied
fruit, raisins, and walnuts.  Stir in as much of the remaining flour
as possible.  Place dough on a lightly floured surface and knead in
remaining flour.  Knead for 10 minutes, until dough is smooth and
elastic.  Place dough in greased bowl, cover, and let rise about 1 1/2
hours or until double in bulk.  Punch dough down and divide in half.
Knead each piece for 1-2 minutes.  Cover and let rest 10 minutes.
Roll each out to an 11 x 7-inch oval.  Fold over in half.  Place on
greased cookie sheets, cover, and let rise about 45 minutes.  Bake in
a preheated 375 oven 25-30 minutes.
