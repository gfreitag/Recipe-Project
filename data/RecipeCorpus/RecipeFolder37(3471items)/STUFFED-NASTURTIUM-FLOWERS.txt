Title: STUFFED NASTURTIUM FLOWERS
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
-- (finely chopped)
1/2 c  Heavy cream; stiffly whipped
16    Nasturtium flowers
2 c  Granulated sugar
3/4 c  Ricotta cheese
1 dr Pure almond extract
2/3 c  Chopped blanched almonds
This recipe makes a pretty and delicious delicious summer dessert.
Gather the flowers when they are just fully ripe and fresh.  Avoid
washing them if possible, but do ensure that they are unblemished,
free from pesticides and have no hidden insects lurking behind the
flower spur.

Lightly beat the sugar into the ricotta cheese and add the almond
extract. Toast the chopped almonds in a hot oven or under a broiler,
watching carefully to make sure they do not burn.  Leave them to cool.
Fold the whipped cream into the cheese mixture and add the toasted
almonds.  Taste and adjust sweetening and flavoring, if desired.  Take
small spoonfuls of the mixture and stuff each flower.  Arrange the
flowers on a serving plate.  Serve as a dessert or afternoon snack
with crisp cookies, a fresh fruit sauce or a colorful mixed fruit
salad.
