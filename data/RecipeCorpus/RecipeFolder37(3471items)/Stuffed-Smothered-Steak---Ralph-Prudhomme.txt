-coarsely chopped
1 1/2 c  Beef stock
1 tb All-purpose flour
Cooked rice, hot
4 lb Boneless sirloin or good
-quality boneless steak
1 md Onion, peeled and cut into
-eighths (1/2 lb approx.)
1 c  Bell peppers, green,
In a small bowl, combine the stuffing ingredients, mixing well.  In a
separate bowl, mix together the seasoned mustard ingredients.

Make 12 to 14 deep slits in the steak with a knife, to form pockets,
being careful not to cut through to the bottom.  Stuff the pockets
fully with the stuffing mixture, using it all.  Rub the surface of the
steak thoroughly with the seasoned mustard.  Cover well and
refrigerate overnight. Keep refrigerated until ready to cook.

Place the steak, stuffing side up, and the juices it has given off, in
a heavy ovenproof 8-quart pan or large Dutch oven with as broad a
bottom as possible, so the steak will lie flat. Sprinkle the onion and
bell peppers on top of the meat and pour 1-1/2 cups of the stock
around the edges and a little over the meat.  Cover pan and bake at
300 F for 1 hour.  Remove lid, push any pieces of onion and bell
peppers on the sides of the pan back into the liquid, and continue
baking uncovered just until tender and juices run clear, about 1 hour
and 45 minutes more.  The cooking time will vary according to the
thickness of the steak.

Remove the pan from oven and transfer steak to a platter. Skim off and
discard fat from the pan juices.  Spoon out about 3 tablespoons of the
pan juices into a small bowl and mix with the flour until smooth.
Place pan over high heat and gradually stir in the flour mixture until
well blended.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until
juices thicken up a little and flour is cooked, about 10 minutes more,
stirring and scraping pan bottom frequently.

Remove from heat and serve immediately with with some of the pan gravy
spooned ove the meat and rice.
