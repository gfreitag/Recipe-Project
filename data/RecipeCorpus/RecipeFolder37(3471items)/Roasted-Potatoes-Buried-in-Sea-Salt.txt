Title: Roasted Potatoes Buried in Sea Salt
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
- or sea salt
12 md New potatoes
2 c  Coarse sea salt
Preheat the oven to 350 F.

Place the potatoes in a medium-size roasting pan or ovenproof
skillet; do not crowd the pan.  Pour the salt over the potatoes;
there should be enough salt that only the very tops of the potatoes
peek through.

Roast the potatoes until tender, about 45 minutes.  Brush the salt
off the potatoes before serving.  Serve hot.

This results in perfectly roasted spuds - crisp skins and soft,
buttery insides - with just the right amount of saltiness.  The salt
acts as a kind of crust without overwhelming the potatoes.  Brush the
hot salt off the potatoes using a pastry brush or your hands well
wrapped in a pot holder.
