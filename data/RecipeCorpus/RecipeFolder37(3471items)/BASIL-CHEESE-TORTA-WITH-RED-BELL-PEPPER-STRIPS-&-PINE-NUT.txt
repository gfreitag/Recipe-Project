Title: BASIL CHEESE TORTA WITH RED BELL PEPPER STRIPS & PINE NUT
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetarian, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
-- peeled, seeded, and
-- cut into 3" x 3/8" strips
1 sm Jar sun-dried tomatoes
-- (packed in olive oil)
Fresh basil for garnish
1/2 lb Cream cheese; softened
4 tb Butter; softened
3/4 c  Basil pesto
1/2 lb Provolone, thinly sliced
1/4 c  Toasted pine nuts
1    Red bell pepper; roasted,
Mix cream cheese and butter with a fork; add pesto and mix well.

Line a small (3-cup) loaf pan or bowl with plastic wrap, leaving
several inches of overhang on each side.  Make a thin layer of
provolone slices on the bottom and partially up the sides.  Spread
1/3 of the pesto mixture over the cheese; artistically arrange 2 or 3
sun-dried tomatoes, 4-6 bell pepper strips, and about 1 tablespoon
toasted pine nuts over the pesto. Repeat layers until all ingredients
are used (reserving some of the pine nuts to sprinkle on top),
pressing down well between layers.  Chill overnight or for several
days.  Serve at room temperature on a platter wreathed with fresh
basil sprigs.  Additional toasted pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes cut
into flowers, red bell pepper strips, and fresh basil sprigs may be
used as garnish.

NOTE: Torta may be presented inverted or not.  Keeps several weeks
refrigerated.  Although best served at room temperature, it slices
best chilled.  I like to serve it on a platter adorned with grape
leaves and small clusters of red and white grapes.

VARIATIONS: =========== Use lemon pesto; substitute slivered toasted
almonds for the pine nuts; omit the sun-dried tomatoes and add 1
teaspoon lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture.

Use purple pesto; omit the red pepper if desired and increase the
sun-dried tomatoes.

Use cinnamon basil pesto; omit the sun-dried tomatoes and the red
peppers if desired, and use pecans instead of pine nuts.
