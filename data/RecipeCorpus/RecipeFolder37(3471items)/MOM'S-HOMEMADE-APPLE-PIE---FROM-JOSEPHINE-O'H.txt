Title: MOM'S HOMEMADE APPLE PIE - FROM JOSEPHINE O'H
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 6 servings
CRUST:
2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
1/4 c  Milk
5 ds Salt
6 lg Macintosh apples, sliced
1/2 c  Light brown sugar
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Allspice
1 ts Nutmeg
Prepare the crust by mixing the flour, oil, milk, and salt. Separate
into two balls, and put each between 2 pieces of wax paper to roll
out, as the crust will be very flaky. Make bottom crust and place in
8-9 inch pie plate, depending upon size you want.

Preheat the oven to 425 F

In a large bowl, put the apples, sugar, and spices. Cut through with a
knife to create the appearance of chopped apples. Put mixture in pie
plate, and dot with a few pats of butter and a few teaspoons of flour.

Roll top crust out, and put on pie. Slit the pie, and put in oven. Be
sure to put a lining underneath the pie or a cookie sheet as the pie
is sure to run over. Bake at 425 degrees for 10 minutes, and then
reduce oven heat to 350 and bake for 50 minutes or until both top and
bottom crusts are brown.

Remove from oven and cool on wire rack. Prepare the following glaze:

3/4 cup confectioners' sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla milk to make a glaze

While the pie is still hot, brush this glaze ontop of the pie and be
sure that the glaze drips into the slits.

Cool, and serve with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream.

This recipe comes from my mother-in-law who worked in a bakery in
Kilkeel, County Down, Northern Ireland in the 1940's. It is the
flakiest crust you will ever make.
