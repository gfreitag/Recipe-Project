This is so simple, but it works!  Slice a potato, as thin as you can.
Season as you wish -- salt, artificial seasonings, whatever ---
arrange on parchment paper, and microwave until golden brown -- in my
microwave, it takes about 12-14 minutes.  The secret is thin slices,
and parchment paper. They taste surprisingly good, and it couldn't be
simpler.  A no-fat potato chip.
