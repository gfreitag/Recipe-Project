One of the glories of the Hungarian cuisine is csike paprikas, which
is made in many variations. The most typical kind is prepared only
with chicken, flavorings and sour cream. Tomatoes and green peppers
are optional additions. Wash chickens and wipe dry. Heat lard in a
large skillet; fry chicken pieces on both sides until golden. Remove
as cooked and keep warm. When all pieces are cooked, pour off almost
all fat; add onions and garlic. Saute until tender. Stir in paprika;
cook one minute. Mix in chicken broth; bring to a boil. Season with
salt and pepper; return chicken pieces to skillet. Cook slowly,
covered, until chicken is tender. Add more broth during cooking, if
needed. Remove to a warm platter. Combine flour and sour cream; mix
into skillet. Cook slowly, stirring, until thickened and smooth.
Return chicken pieces to sauce; leave on stove long enough to heat
through.
