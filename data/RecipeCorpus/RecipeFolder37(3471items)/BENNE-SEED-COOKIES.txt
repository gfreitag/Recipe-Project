Yield: 60 servings
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Vanilla extract
3/4 c  Sesame seeds
12 tb Butter
1 c  Sugar, brown

Preheat oven to 325.  Cream butter until soft, then gradually beat in
sugar and egg until mixture is fluffy. Combine flour and baking
powder; stir into butter mixture.  Add vanilla and sesame seeds and
mix well. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto greased cookie sheets,

soften.

container."
