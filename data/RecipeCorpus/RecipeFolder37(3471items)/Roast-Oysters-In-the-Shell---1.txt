Title: Roast Oysters In the Shell - 1
Categories: Fish/seafoo, White house
Yield: 1 batch
MMMMM---------------------------RECIPE--------------------------------
Select large oysters;  wash and wipe them, and place with the upper or
deep shell down, to catch the juice, over or on live coals.  When they
open their shells, remove the shallow one being careful to save all
the juice in the other;  place them, shells and all, on a hot
platter, and send to table hot, to be seasoned by each person with
butter and pepper to taste.

If the oysters are fine, and they are just cooked enough and served
all hot, this is, par excellence, the style.
