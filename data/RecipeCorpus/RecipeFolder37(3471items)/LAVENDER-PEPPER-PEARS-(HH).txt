Categories: Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 2 servings
1/8 ts Lavender, crumbled
1/2 ts Coarse cracked black pepper
1 tb Fresh lemon juice

-peeled
Sprinkle the lemon juice over the pears.  Combine the lavender and
pepper and sprinkle over the pears.  Serve on a plate with a knife

Note:  Adding a wedge of Italian Fontina or other mild semi-soft
cheese as an accompaniment takes the dessert out of the
"Heart-Healthy" category, but makes it a "More Betterly".
