Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 2 servings
Salt & pepper
4    Tiny yellow squash w/flowers
4    Tiny green squash w/flowers
1/2 c  Chicken stock

MMMMM------------------------FOR GARNISH-----------------------------
Additional nasturtiums
Separate nasturtiums from stems and chop them.  Blend flowers,
shallots, and herbs together with butter and season with salt and
pepper.  Slice squash into thin rounds and squash blossoms into
ribbons.  Keep each separate.
Gently saute squash alone in half the nasturtium butter for 2 to 3
minutes.  Add chicken stock and squash blossoms and simmer while you
cook the pasta.  Drain pasta and add it with remaining nasturtium
butter to squash; season and mix well.  Serve garnished with
additional nasturtium blossoms.
Variation: Delicate vegetables that won't overpower nasturtium butter
~ for example, whole shallots, fava beans, peas, or leeks - can be
added or used in place of squash.
