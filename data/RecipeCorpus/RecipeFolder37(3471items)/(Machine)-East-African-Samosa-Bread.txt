MMMMM-------------------------1 LB LOAF------------------------------
1/4 ts Ground cardamon
1/4 ts Grated nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground black pepper
3/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Frozen green peas
1/4 lb Ground beef

1 sm Onion; chopped
1 1/2 ts Active dry yeast
2 c  Bread flour
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1.  In a large skillet, prefably non-stick, cook the beef, stirring to
break up lumps of meat, until no longer pink, 3 to 5 minutes.  Add the
onion and garlic and cook until the onion is softened, 3 to 5 minutes
longer.  Let cool.

2.  Add the cooled beef mixture and all remaining ingredient except
the peas in the order suggested by your bread manual and process on
the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's directions.

3.  At the beeper (or at the end of the first kneading in the
Panasonic or National), add the still-frozen peas.

Eat warm or cool, cut into wedges instead of slices.

Comments: this is really a main dish, rather than a bread.
