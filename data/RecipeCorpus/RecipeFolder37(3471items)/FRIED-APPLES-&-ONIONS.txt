Title: FRIED APPLES & ONIONS
Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Apples; tart, chopped
2 tb Sugar, brown
1/2 lb Bacon; sliced
2 lb Onions
Salt pork may be substituted for the bacon.

Fry bacon slices in 12" skillet until brown and crisp. Set aside on a
warm serving platter.

While meat is frying, peel onions, leaving stems to hold for slicing.
To prevent your eyes from watering, hold a slice of bread in your
teeth while you slice the onions as thin as possible. Discard stems.

Core apples and cut crosswise in circles about 1/4" thick. Apple
skins help the slices hold their shape and add color to the dish, so
don't peel unless skins are tough or scarred.

Drain all but 1 tb fat from skillet, then add onion slices. Cook over
medium-high heat about 3 minutes. Cover with apple slices in an even
layer. Sprinkle brown sugar over all, cover skillet, & cook until
tender, a few minutes more.  Stir only to prevent scorching. Remove
to warm plate with bacon slices.

This is a "country" dish, seldom mentioned in cookbooks but recalled
by many oldtimers.  Some feel sugar is essential; others call it a
"sin." If you share Almanzo's enthusiasm you might also like to try
fried apples'n'onions with fried potatoes for breakfast sometime.

Here is the recipe Fried Apples'n'Onions from the Little House
Cookbook.
