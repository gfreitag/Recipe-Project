Place the sugar, honey and butter in a saucepan and mix well with a

stir once the toffee begins to boil.  Reduce the heat and continue
to cook, testing the toffee by dropping a little into iced water.
When a little hardens in cold water, remove the toffee from the heat
and pour into patty cases.  Sprinkle with hundreds and thousands and
set aside until the toffee sets.  Store in an airtight container.
