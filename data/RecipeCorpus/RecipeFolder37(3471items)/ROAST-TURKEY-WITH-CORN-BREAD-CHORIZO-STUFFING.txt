3 c  Day-old white bread, cubed
2 c  Frozen corn kernels; thawed

MMMMM---------------------------GRAVY--------------------------------
1 c  White or rose wine
3 c  Chicken stock; as needed
Wash turkey under hot water. Pat exterior and cavities completely dry
with paper towels. Smear turkey with 4 Tbsp butter. Saute onions and
celery in the remaining butter over medium heat until translucent.
Remove with slotted spoon to a very large bowl. Saute the chorizo in
the same pan until lightly brown. Remove to same bowl and add
remaining stuffing ingredients. Toss to combine completely. (If
mixture seems dry, add chicken stock or apple juice. ) Salt and
pepper the turkey's cavity and loosely stuff the cavity and the neck
with the bread-chorizo mixture, leaving some room for expansion
during cooking. (Extra stuffing can be refrigerated in a covered
casserole and baked @ 375 degrees for 40 minutes. )Sew up and truss
the turkey. Return to rack in roasting pan and turn turkey on its
left side. Add 1 cup stock and wine gravy to pan. Place in preheated
400 degree oven for 20 minutes. Turn turkey onto its right side and
continue roasting another 20 minutes. Lower oven to 325 degrees. Turn
turkey breast-side-down and roast for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Baste
every 15 minutes or so, adding stock as needed. Turn turkey
breast-side-up and continue basting every 15-20 minutes. (For a 12 lb
turkey, cooking time will be from 15 to 20 minutes per pound; the
internal temperature should reach 180 degrees. The juices in the
thigh should run clear when pierced with a fork. )Remove to a heated
platter to rest. Skim off as much fat as possible from the pan
drippings. Transfer pan drippings, including brown bits, to a saute
pan. Reduce to a gravy over high heat. Carve turkey. Serve gravy and
dressing on the side. Total cooking time: 3 - 4 1/2 hours.
