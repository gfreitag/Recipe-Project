Braising in tomato sauce guarantees tender, flavorful beef.

Trim all fat from roast.  Rub dry mustard and salt into the surface
of the meat.  Place in a lightly greased, oven-proof dish.  Top with
onion. Combine tomato sauce, vinegar, thyme and pepper.  Pour over
roast and cover tightly.  Bake at 325 F for 3 hours until meat is
tender.
