Title: ROAST PORK (CHAR SHU)
Categories: Chinese, Meats
Yield: 1 servings
1 cl Garlic
3 sl Ginger root
3 lb Pork -- butt, shoulder,
Tenderloin
1 c  Water
6 tb Sugar
1 tb Salt
1/2 c  Dark soy sauce
1/4 c  Rice wine
PREPARATION:

Heat water and add sugar and salt, stirring until melted.  Remove from
stove.  Add soy sauce and rice wine.  Smash, peel, and mince garlic,
and add to the soy sauce mixture.  Peel and mince ginger root and
add.  Mix well.  Place meat in a bowl and pour the mixture over it.
If meat is not completely covered, you will need to turn it
frequently as it marinates. Allow it to stand in the refrigerator for
48 hours.  (You can cheat and make the marinating time shorter --
never shorter than 6 hours -- but the longer the time, the more the
meat will tenderize and absorb the fine flavor.)  Pour off marinade,
but do not wipe meat.  Place the meat on a rack in a baking pan.

COOKING:

Heat oven to 450-degrees.  Bake the meat for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat
to 250-degrees and bake for 30 minutes.  Turn meat over and bake for
another 30 minutes.
