2 1/4 c  All-Purpose Flour; sifted
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Butter; softened
8 oz Cream Cheese; softened
1/4 c  Dairy Sour Cream

1    Egg

Prepare Pastry: Beat butter and cream cheese in a large bowl with an
electric mixer until creamy. Beat in sour cream. Stir in flour and
salt until firm dough forms. Add more flour if necessary. Divide
dough in half. Flatten each half into a 4" square. Wrap in plastic
wrap and refrigerate overnight.
When dough is ready, prepare filling: Combine nuts, sugar, cinnamon,
egg and orange rind in a small bowl.
Roll out half of pastry on a floured surface to a 9" square about 1/4"
thick. Spread 3/4 cup of the filling evenly over pastry. Roll up
jelly-roll style. Wrap in foil. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
Repeat with remaining pastry and filling.
Preheat oven to moderate (350oF.) Lightly grease 2 large cookie
sheets. Cut rolls with a serrated knife into 1/4" thick slices. Place
1/2" apart on cookie sheets. Reshape into rounds, if necessary.
Bake in a preheated moderate oven (350oF) for 15-20 minutes or until
firm and golden brown. Cool on cookie sheets 10 minutes. Remove
cookies to wire racks to cool completely.
