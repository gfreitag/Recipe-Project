1. Prepare Cake: Preheat oven to 350 F. Butter a 12-cup Bundt pan or
fluted tube pan. Lightly dust with flour and tap out excess.

and salt. In another small bowl, stir together bananas, milk, and
vanilla until blended.

3. In a small bowl, using hand-held electric mixer, cream together
butter and sugar until blended. One at a time, add eggs, beating well
after each addition. In three additions each, alternately beat in
flour mixture and banana mixture, until just combined. Stir in toffee
and nuts.

4. Scrape batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake for 65 to
75 mins, or until a cake tester inserted in center of cake comes out
clean.

5. Remove pan to wire rack. Cool for 10 mins before inverting cake
onto a cooling rack; finish cooling on rack.

6. Prepare Glaze: In a small saucepan, melt chocolate and butter over
low heat, tirring often until mixture is completely smooth, with no
streaks. Remove from heat and cool for 5 mins. Pour evenly over
cooled cake. Place cake in refrigerator for 30 mins to set glaze.
Store cooled cake in an airtight container in refrigerator. Allow
cake to reach room temperature before serving.

sheet and bake at 350 F for 5 to 7 mins, shaking sheet a couple of
times, until nuts are lightly browned.
NOTE: This cake is delicious with suggested Chocolate Glaze or with a
Chocolate Sauce.
