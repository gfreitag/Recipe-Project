Title: Peppermint Ice Cream
Categories: Ice cream
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
3 c  Heavy cream
4 dr Red food coloring --
(optional)
1/2 c  Finely crushed peppermint
Candy -- or
1/4 ts Peppermint oil
1/4 c  Creme de menthe
1 lg Egg
1 c  Half-and-half
Put the crushed peppermint candy and the creme de menthe in a blender
and blend on high speed for about 30 seconds. Add the egg, half and
half, sugar, and vanilla extract, and blend on medium speed until the
mixture is smooth and the sugar is dissolved. Slowly add the cream
and blend on low speed for 30 seconds.

Transfer the mixture to your ice-cream machine and freeze according to

manufacturer's instructions.

Makes slightly more than 1 quart.

From: The Joy of Ice Cream, p. 90, by Matthew Klein. Barron's
Educational Series, Woodbury NY, 1985.

Notes:  We used peppermint candy, green creme de menthe, green food
coloring, and about 2/3 cup of chocolate chips thrown into the ice
cream can.
It just fills up my Oster blender -- that's why you use a low speed.

Here's an accidental discovery: Leave out the salt and let it run for
20 minutes or so; then correct the salt-ice mixture.  The extra
beating makes it light and creamy, and doesn't harden too hard.
