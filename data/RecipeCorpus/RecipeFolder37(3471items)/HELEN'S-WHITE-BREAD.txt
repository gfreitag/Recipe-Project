Title: HELEN'S WHITE BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 servings
1 1/2 lb All purpose flour
2 ts Salt
1/2 oz Shortening, soft
1 2/3 c  Warm water
1/2 oz Fresh yeast OR
1 tb Dried yeast
1 tb Sugar
Dissolve the yeast in the warm water with the sugar and fill your
mixer bowl with hot water while weighing flour.

Pour the yeast mixture into the bowl with the shortening and add the
flour. Knead for 30 seconds on speed 1 then turn to speed 2 and
continue kneading for 3 more minutes til dough is smooth and leaves
the side of the bowl clean.  Place in a greased plastic bag and let
rise for 1-1 1/2 hours. Return to bowl and knead a further minute.

Either fit into 3 x 1 lb greased loaf pans (which should be half
full) or shape into 2 or 3 baps and cook on a baking tray. Cover and
prove until double in bulk. Bake at 450 F/230 C/Mk 8 for 25 to 30
minutes. When done the loaves should sound hollow when rapped on the
bottom.
