in the center.  It is eaten with a spoon from the outside, each
spoonful being dipped in the well of melted butter.

The traditional implement used for pounding potatoes was a wooden
masher, pestle-shaped, called a "beetle."  The poem says:
.
There was an old woman
that lived in a lamp;
she had no room
to beetle her champ.
.
She's up'd with her beetle
and broke the lamp,
and now she has room
to beetle her champ.
