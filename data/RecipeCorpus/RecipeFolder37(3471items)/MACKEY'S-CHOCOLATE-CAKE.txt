Cake:  Cream together the shortening and sugar, and add the cocoa. In
a separate bowl, beat the eggs well and add to the cocoa mixture. Add
the milk and flour alternately; dissolve the baking soda in the water
and add. Beat all ingredients well.  Line two lightly greased layer
cake pans with a layer of kitchen parchment (or even cut-up grocery
bags will work). Pour batter into pans evenly, and bake at 350 F.
until the cake leaves the edges of the pans and springs back when
touched. Invert pans on a wire rack to cool.

Icing:  Mix the cocoa and sugar; add the milk.  Add the melted butter
and cook to the soft ball stage in a double boiler (234 F to 240 F).
Remove from the heat and beat until icing thickens and begins to
wrinkle at the edges.  Let cool completely and then ice as for a
normal layer cake.
