Categories: Meats, Asian, Chinese, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Cornstarch; dissolved in
-***
2 tb Water***
3 tb Peanut oil
2 sl Ginger; minced
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Water
2 ts Sesame oil
1/2 lb Boneless beef*
1 tb Oyster sauce**
2 ts Rice wine**
1/2 ts Brown sugar**
2 ts Cornstarch**
1 lb Broccoli; chopped
2 ts Rice wine***
1/2 ts Brown sugar***
*(Flank steak, top sirloin, or tenderloin), sliced across grain into
thin s **(combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl) ***(combine all
seasoning sauce ingredients in a cup) Thoroughly mix beef with
marinade and marinate for 30 minutes.  Heat wok over highest heat,
when hot, swirl in 2 Tblsp peanut oil. Add ginger and salt and toss a
few seconds. Add broccoli and stirfry one minute, then add water,
turn heat to med-high, cover, and steam until crisp tender. Uncover
and turn heat to high, stir frying until water is evaporated. Remove
broccoli and reserve. Reheat same wok (without rinsing) and, when
hot, add remaining peanut oil. Add beef slices and stirfry until
lightly browned but not cooked through. Do not stirfry too vigorously
or meat will not brown, it is better to press slices against sides of
wok to sear. Add broccoli to wok and toss. When hot, stir in
seasoning sauce and stir until sauce thickens (it's a good idea to
whisk the sauce in the cup just before you hurl it into the wok).
Turn onto a platter and drizzle sesame oil over the top. The sugar in
the marinade and seasoning sauce acts as a flavor enhancer rather
than a sweetener.
