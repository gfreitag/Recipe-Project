Here's a good little bread recipe that doesn't use yeast or need a
machine!
Gently mix together four, sugar and beer until just blended.  Turn
into greased 9x5x3 loaf pan (leave lumpy).
Bake 1 hour (or until toothpick comes out clean).  Metal pan 375
degrees, glass pan 350 degrees.
Drizzle with butter.  Turn out on rack; cool.
