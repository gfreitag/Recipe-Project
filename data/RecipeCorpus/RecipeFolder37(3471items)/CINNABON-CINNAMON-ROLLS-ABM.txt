Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------------ROLLS--------------------------------
1    Eggs; beaten
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
4 c  Bread flour
2 1/2 ts Yeast
1/4 c  Butter; melted
1/4 c  Water
1/2 pk Instant vanilla pudding
-(1/2 of a 3.4oz. box)
1 c  Milk
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 ts Cinnamon, ground
1/2 c  Butter; softened
1 c  Brown sugar
MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
1/2 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 ts Milk
4 oz Cream cheese; softened
1/4 c  Butter; softened
1 1/2 c  Confectioners sugar
Rolls: Place ingredients in machine following the specifications of
that particular machine.  Set for dough cycle (about 1 hr. 40 minutes
in my Hitachi B101 - Debbie Carlson). After complete on dough cycle,
remove from machine & roll out to 17 x 10 (approx) rectangle.
Filling: Mix together brown sugar and cinnamon.  Spread softened
butter over
dough. Sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon mixture over top.  Roll
tightly from
long end, pinching edges closed when completely rolled.  Slice rolled
dough into 1/2" slices (or larger if a larger bun is preferred
).Place into greased
cake pans.  ( I use 3 - 9" pans )  I usually get 19 - 20 buns from
this. Let
rise until doubled. Bake at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes, until golden.
Do not overbake.
Frosting: Spread on very warm rolls.  They are best when eaten fresh,
but we
have found that 10-15 seconds in the microwave rejuvenates them!
Note:  I made these in my Hitachi B101 and the dough turned out
beautifully!
I added chopped nuts to the filling though and doubled the cinnamon.
I also
sliced my rolls about 1" and placed them in a non-stick 13x9" baking
pan which rendered about 10 large rolls.  Also, because I don't care
for a cream
cheese frosting, I used 3 c powdered sugar, 4 Tbsp. softened butter,
1 tsp. vanilla and about 3 Tbsp. milk which made lots of frosting,
perhaps too much.
