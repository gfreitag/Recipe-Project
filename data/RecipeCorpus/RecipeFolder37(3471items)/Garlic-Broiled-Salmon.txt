MMMMM----------------EATING WELL CB; DOERPER, JOH---------------------
1/2 ts Nuoc mam; Vietnamese fish sa
1 c  Bread crumbs
6 ea Salmon steaks
1/4 c  Butter
1/3 c  Olive oil
8 ea Elephant garlic cloves
1/4 c  Chervil, chopped
1/2 ts Dill weed
Crush garlic.  Process oil, garlic, chervil, dill, and nuoc mam in
blender until smooth.  Mix with cracker crumbs.  Place salmon on
well-greased broiler rack; brush steaks with butter.  Broil about 4"
from heat for 8-10 minutes, until fish flakes easily when tested with
fork.  Carefully turn steaks.  Spread about 2 tb garlic mixture on
each steak.  Broil 1-2 minutes more, until lightly browned.  Serve
hot.

Nuoc Mam is an oriental fish sauce that is to Vietnamese cooking what
soy sauce is to Chinese cooking and salt is to Western cooking. The
writer likes using this mild-flavored condiment in lieu of salt. Look
for the words Ca Com on the label, which mean that only anchovies
were used in making the sauce, and for the word nhi which signifies a
sauce of the highest quality.  Both Vietnamese and Thai fish sauces
are excellent. Philippine and Chinese fish sauces are too coarse. The
Squid brand is best.
