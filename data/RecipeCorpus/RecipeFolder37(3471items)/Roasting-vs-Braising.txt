Roasting is a dry-heat cooking method in which food is cooked in an
uncovered pan without any added liquid. Roasting usually produces a
crisp exterior and juicy interior.

Braising is a moist-heat method of cooking: The meat, poultry or
vegetable cooks in a small amount of liquid in a covered container,
usually for a long time. Cuts of meat that have well-developed muscle
and very little fat, such as shoulder, rump, or leg, are often
braised because the slow cooking tenderizes the meat.
