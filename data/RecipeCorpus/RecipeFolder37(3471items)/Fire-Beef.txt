1 lb Beef sirloin (boneless

1/4 c  Minced onion
2 ts Minced garlic
1/4 c  Soy sauce
Cut sirloin into paper-thin slices. This is easier to do if meat is
first frozen until hard. Combine onion, garlic, soy sauce, sugar,
black and red pepper, sesame seed, and oil; mix well. Pour over beef
slices, coating each slice with the sauce. Grill on skewers over
charcoal. Or broil in a broiler 6 inches from source of heat, turning
occasionally to brown on all sides.
