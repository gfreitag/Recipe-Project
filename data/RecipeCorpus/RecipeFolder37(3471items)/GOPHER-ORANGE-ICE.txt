Title: GOPHER ORANGE ICE
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 24 servings
1 1/2 c  Orange juice
1    Egg whites
1 tb Sugar
3 pt Water
4 c  Sugar
1 c  Lemon juice
Make a syrup of water and sugar; when cool add lemon juice and
orange juice; freeze and when half frozen add egg white, beaten
well with sugar.  Thoroughly beat it with the ice, finish
freezing and serve.

Strawberries or slices of pineapples gently stirred through just
before serving (if added too long before, they freeze and are
unpleasant to eat) make a delicious variety.

*Pineapple Ice* may be made of canned pineapple using pint of
juice, and gill lemon juice with above proportion of syrup,
adding the pine-apple cut in dice just before serving, if
wished. With all ices if is always add a gill of lemon juice, as
the acid assists in the freezing and also adds to the flavor.
Any proportions of the recipe may be made; above makes about two
dozen dishes.
