ORIGINAL POSTERS NOTES: *NOTE: For greater flavor with little or no
fat add, substitute no fat beef broth or some wine for part of the
water called for in the ingredients.

**If you have a sensitivity to sodium, note that the dry onion soup
mix may be high in salt.  I have also posted a recipe for onion
seasoning mix in CAT 3 TOPic 31 that was posted on the board sometime
back that enables you to use your own mix and control the amount of
salt in it.
