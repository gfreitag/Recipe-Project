Title: Ginger Juice
Categories: Herbs/spice, Condiments
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 lb Fresh ginger
Peel the ginger and coarsely chop it. Puree it in a food processor,
then spoon the puree into a clean tea towel over a bowl. Firmly
squeeze the towel, releasing about  1/2 cup of juice into the bowl.
The juice can be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed jar for up to
one week. It will separate, but this won't affect the flavor.
