MMMMM-------------------------DUMPLINGS------------------------------
2 c  Buttermilk biscuit mix
3    3" fresh rosemary sprigs
1 1/4 c  ;Water
Add chicken to the water in a stockpot and bring to a boil; simmer,
covered, about 20 minutes or until tender.  Remove chicken to a plate
to cool.

Add onion, garlic, celery and carrots to the stock; bring to a simmer.

Cut or tear chicken into 2" pieces; return it to the stock.  Simmer
for about 30 minutes, or until all the vegetables are very tender.
Stir the cornstarch mixture into the stock, if you like a thick sauce.

To make dumplings and while vegetables are cooking, bring to a boil 1
1/4 cups water in a small pan.  Turn off the heat and add three
sprigs of rosemary. Cover; let steep for 30 minutes. Strain the
rosemary tea and mix with about 2 cups of biscuit mix, slightly more
if mixture is very gooey.

Bring the chicken stock back to a low boil; drop scant teaspoons of
dumpling batter into the bubbles.  Gently push each dumpling aside
with a spoon to keep dumplings from clumping together.  Add two more
rosemary sprigs.  Lower heat, cover, and simmer 5 to 10 minutes.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
