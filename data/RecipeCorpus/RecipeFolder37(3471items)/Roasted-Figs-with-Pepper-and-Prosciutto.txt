Title: Roasted Figs with Pepper and Prosciutto
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
4    Ripe fresh figs
Freshly ground black pepper
1 tb Olive oil
4 sl Prosciutto; paper-thin
Preheat the oven to 400 F.

Cut each slice of prociutto lengthwise into four strips.

Peel figs and quarter lengthwise.

Grease the bottom of a small roasting pan or ovenproof skillet with
half of the oil.  Wrap of strip of prosciutto around each fig quarter
and place in the pan.  Sprinkle generously with pepper.

Roast the figs until they are hot all the way through, but not falling
apart, about 5 to 8 minutes, depending upon the ripeness of the figs.

This is a variation on a favorite Italian antipasto, where fresh fig
quarters are wrapped in prosciutto and served cold.
