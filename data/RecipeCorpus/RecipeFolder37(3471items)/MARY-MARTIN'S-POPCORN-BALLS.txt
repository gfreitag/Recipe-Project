and salt until 254ø- 260øF.  Add vanilla and vinegar and boil to

Mary was a spinster neighbor when I was a child who had to be the
youngest woman I have ever know and the best substitute grandmother a
child could have ever wished for. She knew that her mother had been
making this recipe as far back as 1880.
