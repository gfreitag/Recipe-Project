I didn't save the post so I don't remember what I said.  I think I
offered 2
versions.  One is to take your pumpkin pie recipe and replace the
pumpkin with sweet potatoes.  The other is a recipe just for a sweet
potato pudding.  I even did one better this time I found yet another
recipe so Hey, 3 for the price of one. :-)  Bill
1 C sugar
1/2 C melted butter
1 C orange juice
1/4 t nutmeg.
Combine all the ingredients and beat well.
2 C cooked, mashed sweet potatoes
6 beaten egg yolks
1 1/2 t grated lemon rind

Fold in 2 stiffly beaten egg whites.  Bake in a 350 F oven until done,
about 1 hour.  I would probably use brown sugar.
