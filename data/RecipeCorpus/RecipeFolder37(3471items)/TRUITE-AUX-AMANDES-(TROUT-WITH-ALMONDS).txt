Title: TRUITE AUX AMANDES (TROUT WITH ALMONDS)
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 lb Unsalted butter
2 tb Vegetable oil
6 oz Sliced almonds
1 tb Chopped parsley
Parsley for garnish
6    Trout, about 8 oz each
1    Lemon
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper
3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1.  Clean the trout as you would any roundfish and trim the tails, but
do not scale the fish (trout have such small scales as to make
scaling unnecessary.
2.  With a small sharp knife, cut a slice off the top and bottom of
the
lemon.  Stand the fruit upright on a work surface and, following
the
contours of the fruit, use a small paring knife to cut away the
skin
and bitter white pith.  Cut crosswise into 6 slices 1/4 inch
thick;
set aside.
3.  Season the trout, inside and out, with salt and pepper.  Dip the
trout in flour to coat completely and shake off the excess.  Heat
3
tablespoons of the butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in a large
frying
pan over medium heat.  Add 3 trout and cook until golden brown on
one side, 5-8 minutes.  Turn and continue cooking until golden
brown
and tender when the flesh is pierced with the point of a knife,
5-8 minutes longer.  Transfer to a platter and cover to keep warm.
Repeat to cook the 3 remaining trout.
4.  Discard the butter and oil in the pan.  Heat the remaining 10
tablespoons butter in the same pan over medium heat.  Add the
almonds
and saute until golden brown.  Pour over fish.  Place 1 slice of
lemon on each trout.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley.
