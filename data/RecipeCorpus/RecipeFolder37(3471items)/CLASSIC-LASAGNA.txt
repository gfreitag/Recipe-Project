Cook lasagna in a large quantity of boiling water until just barely
tender; drain off most of water; add ice cubes to stop cooking. (Allow
lasagna to stand in cold water to prevent pasta sticking together.)

liquid, tomato sauce, tomato paste, salt and oregano. Simmer 15 mins.
Combine egg with spinach, cottage and parmesan cheeses. Spread 1/3 of

overlapping strips.) Alternate another 1/3 of sauce and 1/4 of
lasagna. Spread spinach mixture over pasta and cover with 1/4 lasagna
strips. Top with remaining sauce and pasta. Arange mozzarella cheese
on top. Bake at 350F for 30 mins. Let stand 10 mins. before serving.
