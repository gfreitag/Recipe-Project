Allow 2 ribs per person.

If you wish to season the roast try rubbing the cut side of the
garlic halves over the surface of the roast. Sprinkle on thyme,
rosemary, marjoram, salt and/or pepper over the meat and rub it
in. Allow the roast to sit half an hour for the herb flavor to
infuse the meat before cooking.

Preheat the oven to 450. Protect the ends of the bones by covering
with aluminum foil. Immediately after putting the roast in the oven
decrease the temp to 325. Roast for about 20 min per pound or until
the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees F as measured with a
meat thermometer. [Older recipes called for a 350 oven, up to 45
min per pound and a 185 deg internal temp. but 155 is sufficient
to kill trichinosis and the roast will not be dried out.]

An hour before the roast is finished, remove it from the oven briefly
and fill the center with a dressing such as sausage, apple & onion or
savory rice. Return the roast to the oven. Remove the foil for the
last half hour.

You can make pan gravy possibly enriched with red currant jelly
and/or port and brandy. The brandy can be flamed for an elegant
presentation. Good garnishes are glazed onions, baked cinnamon
apples or broiled peaches or apricots all on a bed of watercress.
An excellent accompliment is pan roasted potatoes or garlic mashed
potatoes. Other recommended vegetables are brussel sprouts or
leeks braised in butter,apple sauce, sauerkraut, or glazed
turnips.

For ease in carving, insert fork in top of roast; make slices by
cutting close along sides of rib bones.
