Title: Ardent One's Marinade
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
-(juice and all)
1/2 c  Chopped onion
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
Mix equal parts of:
1/2 c  Vinegar
1/2 c  Soy souce
15 oz Can of crushed pineapple
Here is a really yummy marinade that will turn any meat or poultry
into a yummy, tender dinner for you!

Mix all ingredients together in a deep dish, throw in the meat and
let soak overnight in the fridge.  (12 hours minimum)

Throw out the mixture after you cook the meat...it is not healthy to
eat the stuff after raw meat has been soaking in it.

Enjoy!!
