2. Place the salmon in the container of a food processor. Add
salt, pepper, nutmeg and Tabasco. Add the egg and blend for 10
seconds. Combine the half-and-half and heavy cream. Add the cream
mixture and continue blending for about 30 seconds until the
mixture has a fine texture.

3. Grease the inside of four 1 1/2-inch souffle dishes with the
butter. Spoon an equal portion of the mixture into each souffle
dish. Smooth over the tops and cover loosely with aluminum foil.

4. Place the dishes in a high-sided metal pan and pour hot water
halfway up the sides of the dishes. Place the pan on top of the
stove and bring the water to a boil. Transfer the pan to the
bottom of the oven and bake for 20 minutes.

mousse. If the thermometer registers 140 F. or if the end comes
out clean, the mousse is done. Unmold onto a warm plate and serve
with tomato sauce.
