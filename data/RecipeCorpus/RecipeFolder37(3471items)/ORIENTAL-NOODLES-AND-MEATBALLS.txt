To Make Oriental Meatballs: preheat oven to 375F. In a medium bowl,
combine all ingredients. Roll heaping teaspoons of meat mixture into
30 balls of about 1/2 inch diameter.  Place on a nonstick 15" x 10"
jelly roll pan, or coat pan with non-stick vegetable spray. Bake in
preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 - 15 minutes. Drain off any
drippings before serving. Makes 30 meatballs.
While meatballs bake, cook noodles in lightly salted boiling water,
until just tender. Cook fresh noodles 3 - 5 minutes, cook dry noodles
5 - 7 minutes. Drain cooked noodles; rinse with hot water. Pour
noodles into a medium bowl; keep warm. In saucepan used to cook
noodles, combine broth, 1/3 C water, soy sauce and cornstarch. Bring
to a boil, stirring constantly.  Add drained noodles; stir gently
until coated. Cut green onions into brushes or into 2-inch pieces.
Cut each piece length wise into thin strips.
