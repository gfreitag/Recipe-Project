Title: POACHED SALMON WRAPPED IN SILVERBEET
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Main dish, Guestchefs
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Good fish stock
1 c  Dry white whine
3 tb Creme fraiche
Chervil sprigs, for garnish
1 bn Young silverbeet
4 ea Salmon fillets (about 170g
-each)
1 tb Butter
Blanch the silverbeet leaves briefly in boiling water for 10
seconds.  Spread carefully on tea-towels and use a small sharp knife
to remove the tough central stems.  Skin salmon fillets.  Heat
butter in a frying pan and seal fillets over medium heat on all
sides.  Remove from pan and place a fillet at one end of a leaf (use
two overlapping leaves if they are small), and wrap carefully,
tucking in sides, to make a neat parcel.  Repeat with remaining
fillets.  Combine stock and wine in a saucepan and bring to the
boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Place wrapped fillets
in a large saucepan and pour in enough simmering stock to reach two
thirds up the sides of the parcels.  Poach gently for 8-9 minutes,
or until fillets are tender when tested with a fine skewer.  Remove
parcels to warm serving bowls.  Bring poaching liquid to the boil
over high heat and boil for 2 minutes.  Add 3 tablespoons creme
fraiche, blend well and heat through.  Divide broth among serving
bowls and garnish each with chervil sprigs.
