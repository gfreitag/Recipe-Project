Title: Sweet Potato-Polenta Galettes
Categories: Potatoes
Yield: 30 pieces
4 tb Butter
Salt and pepper
1/3 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
2 c  Cornmeal
2 lg Sweet potatoes
Peeled and quartered
1. Lightly oil a jelly-roll pan or other shallow-rimmed baking sheet.
In a bowl, combine the cornmeal with 2 cups cold water and set aside
to soak.

2. Put the sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with cold water
and bring to a boil. Boil the sweet potatoes until they are very
soft, about 20 min. Drain well and mash the sweet potatoes until
smooth. You should have about 1 1/4 cups.

3. In an other medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add
2 tbs butter, 1 tsp salt,  1/2 tsp pepper, and the cornmeal mixture.
Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to moderately high, and cook,
stirring often, until the mixture is very thick, 6-8 min. Remove from
the heat and stir in the sweet potato puree. Season with salt and
pepper. Spread the mixture on the prepared baking sheet in an even
3/4-inch-thick layer and cover with wax paper. Refrigerate until
firm, at least 1 hour.

4. Using a round or oval 2-3-inch fluted cookie cutter, stamp out the
galettes. Or cut the sweet potato mixture into 2-inch squares with a
knife.

5. Preheat the broiler. In a large skillet, melt the remaining 2 tbs
butter over moderately high heat. Fry the galettes in batches until
lightly browned on both sides. As they are done, transfer them to
cookie sheets. Sprinkle with the cheese and broil 4-6 inches from the
heat for about 3 min, or until lightly browned around the edges and
heated through. Serve immediately.
