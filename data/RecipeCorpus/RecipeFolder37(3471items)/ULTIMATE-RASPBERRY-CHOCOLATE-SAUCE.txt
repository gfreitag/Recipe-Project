Categories: Salsa/sauce, Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Heavy cream
4 tb Unsalted butter; softened
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Light corn syrup
12 oz Frozen raspberries
-(individually quick-frozen)
- defrosted
3/4 c  Dutch-process cocoa
PUREE THE RASPBERRIES in a food processor fitted with a steel blade,
then pass them through a fine strainer. Or pass them through a food
mill. Set aside. In a medium-size heavy saucepan, whisk together the
cocoa and heavy cream. Add the butter, sugar, corn syrup and
raspberries and stir until well blended. Place the pan over medium
heat and slowly bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often. Once it
reaches a boil, let it continue to boil slowly for 8 minutes without
stirring. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the sauce into a
container. Let it cool for 15 minutes if serving hot, or cover and
refrigerate until needed. It will last for at least 1 month. The
sauce may be reheated slowly. Makes 2 1/2 Cups
