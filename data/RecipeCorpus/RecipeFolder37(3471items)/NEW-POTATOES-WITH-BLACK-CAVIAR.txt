Categories: Appetizers, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Sour cream
4 oz Black caviar
12    New potatoes, very small
4 c  Rock salt
Oil; deep frying
Preheat oven to 450.
Wash and dry potatoes. Arrange potatoes on a bed of rock salt in a
shallow baking pan and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until done.
Remove potatoes from oven and cut into halves. Scoop out pulp with a
melon-ball cutter, being careful to keep shells intact. Mash pulp
slightly in a small bowl and keep warm.
Heat oil to 375 in a large saucepan. Drop potato shells gently into
oil and deep fry til golden brown and crisp. Drain well on paper
towels.
Fill potato shells with mashed potatoes, top with a spoonful of sour
cream, and add a teaspoon or more of caviar. Serve on a thick salad
plate atop hot rock salt.
