Whether it is called "Plum Pudding", or "Christmas Pudding", this
traditional Christmas dessert find its roots in a medieval harvest
dish,an unsweetened wheat stew called "frumenty". It can be traced
back even farther to Scandinavian and Russian preparations.
Gradually, beef broth was added along with brown bread for
thickening; spices and dried fruits like raisinsand currants added
interest. According to English tradition,it should be prepared on
"Stir Up Sunday", the first Sunday of Advent and everyone in the
household from the babe-in-arms to the oldest member should take a
turn at the mixing. This is an adaptation of a recipe dating back to
1845.

Mix all ingredients except eggs and brandy until well blended, use
your hands if necessary. Stir in eggs, and brandy. Pour into lightly
greased pudding mold or basin (or a coffee tin) and cover top with a
piece of greased foil and clean cloth. Tie coverings, tightly and
leave strings to assist in removing from pot later. Place on rack in
pot with boiling water 2/3 way up the side of the basin. Boil gently
for 3 to 3-1/2 hours. Remove carefully from cooled water, using
strings. Cool completely and store in a cool place (or the
refrigerator) until Christmas. Too serve, reheat unmolked pudding by
steaming or wrap in foil and reheat gently in oven. Invert onto
serving platter; set aflame, if desired, with brandy and insert holly
in top. Serve with whipped cream or brandied hard sauce. Makes 8-10
servings.
