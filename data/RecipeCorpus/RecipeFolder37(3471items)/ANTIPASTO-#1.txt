On platter, arrange lettuce, leaving a hole in the middle large
enough to hold the can of tuna. Drain oil from the can over the
lettuce, then place tuna in the middle of platter.
Divide platter into sections, placing 1/2 slice of cheese in each
section. On top of cheese, place 1 rolled slice of each type of meat.
Drain liquid from red pepper jar over all, then randomly place
peppers, olives, and tomatoes around the platter. Salt and pepper to
taste, then pour more olive oil over all.
Eat heartily, accompanied by much loud Italian conversation. In fact,
I typed this accompanied by much loud Italian conversation. My
parents were here, and both were shouting instructions over my
shoulder. They disagreed about the arrangement of the lettuce - my
mother said that the hole in the middle of the platter was necessary;
my father insisted that it wasn't, saying you can just dump the tuna
on top of the lettuce. I finally had to give up on this reply until
they went home. So now, in the peace and quiet of the aftermath, I've
finished it. Hope you had a wonderful holiday.
