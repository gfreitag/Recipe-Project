1 1/2 c  Cookie crumbs

To quote the author, "Try this with graham wafers, gingersnaps,
vanilla wafers, chocolate wafers - very finely crumbled. It's quick,
easy and has more flavour than pastry."
(Anne's note, use with a precooked filling that is poured into a pie
crust; ie, some chocolate pies."
Combine the crumbs with the sugar and melted butter. Press the mixture
firmly against the bottom and sides of a pie plate, using the back of
a spoon. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes at 300F.
