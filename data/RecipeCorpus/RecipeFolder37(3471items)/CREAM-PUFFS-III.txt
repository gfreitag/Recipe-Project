Title: CREAM PUFFS III
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 12 servings
1 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
6    Eggs
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Unsalted butter
1.  Preheat oven to 400F.
2.  Put the water and butter in a medium saucepan, and set over
medium-
high heat.  Adjust the heat so that the butter is melted about the
same time as the water begins to boil.  Off the heat, add the flour
all at once and stir until blended.  Over medium-high heat, beat
the mixture until it forms a mass around the spoon and a film begins
to form on the bottom and sides of the pan.  This indicates the
flour is cooked.
3.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  You
can use an electric mixer for this.  The batter should be shiny
and fall slightly from a spoon when lifted.
4.  Using a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2" plain tip (or a spoon), form
3 to 4 inch mounds of dough on a greased cookie sheet, leaving 2
inches between each.  Bake for 15 minutes.  Lower the oven to 350F
and bake another 10 minutes, or until the puffs are browned and dry
looking.  Let cool on the sheet.
5.  When cool, cut the tops off the puffs and carefully pull out any
uncooked parts from the inside.  Place tops back on the cream puffs.
At this point, the puffs can be used immediately or frozen for later
use.
