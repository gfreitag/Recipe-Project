Title: MAMA'S COOKIE-COVERED NUTS
Categories: Cookies, Mom
Yield: 3 Dozen
2 c  Flour
1 1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Butter, unsalted
2 ts Vanilla extract
1 pn Salt
Mixed nuts
Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  Cut in the butter. Add
the vanilla extract and a tiny amount of water SLOWLY to form a
heavy, thick dough.  (The amount of water varies by the amount of
humidity in the air; never a given in Florida!)

Shape dough into balls, and wrap around various types of nuts. Bake
at 275 degrees for 30 minutes.  (If you add too much water, the
cookie will flatten out with an obvious, single nut in the middle.
But they still taste good!)

Vicki's notes:

*  When my brother and I were young, Daddy made "surprise" biscuits
for a special breakfast.  They were just refrigerated dough, but he
would always sneak something into the middle, such as jam, peanut
butter, you never knew!  We adored the surprises, and I guess this
was my mother's way of doing the same thing...
