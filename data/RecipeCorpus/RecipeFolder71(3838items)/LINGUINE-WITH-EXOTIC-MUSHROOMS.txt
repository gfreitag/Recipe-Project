Title: LINGUINE WITH EXOTIC MUSHROOMS
Categories: Pasta, Meatless
Yield: 2 Servings
6 oz Linguine, uncooked
4 oz Button mushrooms
4 oz Wild mushrooms
-(shiitake, cremini
-or oyster)
1 tb Butter or margarine
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1/4 c  Low-fat sour cream
1/4 c  Skim milk
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
Prepare pasta according to package directions. While pasta is
cooking, wipe all the mushrooms clean with a paper towel. Trim the
stem end from the mushrooms. (Remove all of the stems if you are
using shiitakes.) Slice mushrooms 1/4-inch thick.

Melt the butter or margarine over low heat in a large skillet with a
tight-fitting lid. Add mushrooms and parsley, cover skillet and let
mushrooms cook until they are completely tender and have released
their liquid, about 15 minutes. Check the mushrooms once or twice
during cooking to make sure they are not browning.

Whisk the sour cream and milk in a small bowl until smooth. Just
before draining the pasta, mix 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking water
into the sour cream mixture.

Drain the pasta and transfer it to the skillet. Add the sour cream
mixture and heat to boiling. Add salt and pepper to taste. Boil
together one minute, tossing pasta to coat with sauce and to evenly
distribute mushrooms. Divide pasta between two plates, spooning extra
sauce on top. Serve immediately.
