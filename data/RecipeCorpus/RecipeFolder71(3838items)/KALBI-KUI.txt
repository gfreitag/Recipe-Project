Title: KALBI KUI
Categories: Meats, Korean
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Short ribs
1 tb Bouillon powder
1/4 c  Water
3 tb Olive oil
3 tb Sesame oil
2    Scallions, diced
Marinate the ribs in the rest of the ingredients for
several hours (or overnight) in a covered dish in the
refrigerator.  Turn at least once half-way through the
marinating time. (I put it in the refrigerator the
night before, then turn the ribs in the morning and
put them back in the refrigerator until dinnertime.)
Broil 5 minutes each side.

NOTES:

*  Korean marinated ribs -- Suitable for Passover.

*  This is traditional for Passover in our house
(well, we like Oriental food, and Passover is somewhat
limiting...).

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  Several hours marinating, 15 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
