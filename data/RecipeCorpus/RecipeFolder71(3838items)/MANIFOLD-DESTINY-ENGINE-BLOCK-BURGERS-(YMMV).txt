Title: MANIFOLD DESTINY ENGINE BLOCK BURGERS (YMMV)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Bag lf pita bread
1    Piece of aluminum foil
1    Better n'Burgers
I travel quite a bit.  Most of the time I'm on commercial airplanes,
but on occasion I have to drive. A few weeks ago I dropped my wife
off in a remote part of Northern Georgia. When I reached Tennesee, It
was time to stop and refill my cooler. The supermarket had Better n
Burgers at a price much lower than in Chicago so I decided to buy
four packages. As I was about to check out a thought hit me.

Now dear readers, are you sitting down?  What you are about to read
really happened and I strongly reccomend it to all vlf travelers.

I picked up a bag of lf pita bread, a roll of aluminum foil and a
bottle of Katsup.  After paying for my supplies I went to my car and
unrolled a piece of foil about three feet long.

In the middle of the foil I placed one of the newly purchased Better n
Burgers.  The sides were folded and sealed. This left a long foil
pack with a "burger" in the middle. OK, are you ready for this? I
popped open the hood of the car and placed the foil packet directly
on the engine. The long tails on the packet gave me enough foil to
secure the burger on various engine outcropings.

I closed the hood and drove for about 30 minutes.

After a little experimenting, I learned that it takes about 1 1/2
hours to cook the burger if you have it directly on the valve cover.
Results may vary.

The packet was retrieved, the "burger" was placed into a pita half
and I munched merrily along I-24.

Ahh, manifold destiny.
