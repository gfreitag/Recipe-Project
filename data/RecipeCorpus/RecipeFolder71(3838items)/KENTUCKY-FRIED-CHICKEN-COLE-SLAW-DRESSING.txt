Title: KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN COLE SLAW DRESSING
Categories: Salad
Yield: 1 Recipe
4 1/2 tb Tarragon Vinegar
6 1/2 tb Vegetable oil
3/4 c  Chopped onion
2 1/2 c  Miracle Whip
1 c  Sugar
2    Carrots, peeled
2    Medium-large heads cabbage
Mix oil and onions, add sugar and Tarragon Vinegar.
Fold in Miracle Whip. Can be made with Miracle Whip
Fat Free (I have tried this and it still tastes the
same).  Do not substitute Tarragon Vinegar with plain
vinegar. The Tarragon is the secret seasoning.  Best
if made the night before serving so the flavors all
blend well.  Will keep a long time in refrigerator.
