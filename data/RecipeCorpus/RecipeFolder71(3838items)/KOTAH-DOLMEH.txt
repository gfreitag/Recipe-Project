3 1/2 c  Plain flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground cardamom
1/4 c  Melted, cooled ghee or oil

Oil; for deep frying
For Dough: Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water; add
remaining water and rose water.  Sift together flour,
salt and cardamom in a bowl. Measure and set aside 1/2
cup of flour mixture.  Add yeast liquid to flour in
bowl, mixing until a soft dough forms.  Work in ghee
or oil with reserved flour, kneading until dough is
smooth (about 10 minutes).  Cover bowl and leave in a
warm place to rise, 45-60 minutes, or until doubled in
size. While dough is rising, wash lentils and place in
a pan with cold water. Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat
to low, cover and simmer until water is absorbed and
lentils are tender, about 1 to 1-1/4 hours. Mash
cooked lentils with a fork. In a skillet, saute onions
in ghee or oil until lightly browned.  Mix in mashed
lentils and cook mixture another 5 minutes.  Add brown
sugar, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Cool. On a lightly floured surface, roll out half of
dough thinly.  Using a biscuit or cookie cutter, cut
out 3-inch circles.  Place a heaping teaspoon of
lentil paste in the center of each circle of dough.
Lightly moisten edges with water, fold in half and
seal by pressing with the tines of a fork.
Deep fry kotahs, 6-8 at a time, about 3 minutes or
until golden brown and puffed, turning to cook evenly.
Drain on absorbent paper.  Serve hot or warm for a
snack or as part of a meal.
