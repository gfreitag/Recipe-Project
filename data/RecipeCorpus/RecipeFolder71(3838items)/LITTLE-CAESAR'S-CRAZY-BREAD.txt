Categories: Breads, Dressings, Copycat
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Tube 10 oz Pillsbury pizza
Dough
2 tb Butter
1 ts Garlic salt
Kraft 100% Grated Parmesan
Cheese
1.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. 2.  Unroll the dough on a
cutting board.  Position it lengthwise (longer from let to right than
from top to bottom). With a sharp kinfe, cut the dough in half down
the middle. Then cut each of those halves vertically  in half, and
then in half once more so that you have 8 even strips of dough. 3.
Being careful not to stretch the dough, place each strip on a lightly
greased cookie sheet and bake for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the top
just turns golden brown. 4. While the dough bakes, melt the butter
(on the stove or in the microwave on high for 15 to 20 seconds), then
add the garlic salt and stir until it dissolves. 5. Remove the
browned dough from the oven and with a pastry brush or spoon spread a
coating of garlic butter over each piece. 6. Sprinkle a generous
amount of Parmesan cheese on each. Makes 8 pieces.
