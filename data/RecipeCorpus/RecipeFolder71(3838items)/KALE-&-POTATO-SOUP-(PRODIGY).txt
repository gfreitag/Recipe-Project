Categories: Soups, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
7 c  Water
1 lg Bunch kale
1 1/4 lb Red potatoes
Salt
2    Bay leaves
3 tb Virgin olive oil
1 md Red or yellow onion
- diced into 1/2-in squares
6    Garlic cloves; sliced
1/2 ts Red pepper flakes
Freshly ground pepper
Finely chopped parsley
- for garnish
HEAT WATER IN LARGE PAN. Meanwhile, with sharp knife,
remove stems of ruffled kale leaves. Chop stems into
1-inch long pieces and add them to the water. Cut
leaves into pieces about 2-inch square, wash well and
set aside. Scrub and peel potatoes and add peels to
heating water along with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 bay
leaf. When water boils, lower heat and let it simmer
while you assemble remaining ingredients. Cut peeled
potatoes into pieces about 1/2-inch square. Heat oil
in soup pot, add onion, garlic, red pepper flakes and
remaining bay leaf. Cook over medium-high heat 3 or 4
minutes, stirring frequently, then season with salt.
Stir in potatoes and 1 cup strained simmering stock.
Cover and cook slowly 5 minutes. Add kale, cover again
and steam until leaves are wilted, stirring once or
twice. Strain remaining stock into soup pot. Bring to
boil, reduce heat and simmer slowly, covered, until
potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes. Use back of
wooden spoon to break up potatoes by pressing them
against sides of pot or puree 1 or 2 cups soup in
blender and return it to pot to make unifying
background for other elements. Taste soup and season
to taste with salt and generous grinding of pepper. If
possible, set soup aside 1 hour to allow flavors to
merge and develop even further, then serve with light
sprinkling of parsley.
