Title: KATHY PITTS' BREAKFAST TACOS
Categories: Mexican, Breakfast
Yield: 4 Servings
1 md Potato, boiled and cut
-into chunks or grated
4 sl Bacon
4    Eggs, lightly beaten
4    Flour tortilla
Place bacon in a cold pan, and cook until almost
crisp.  All the fat should be rendered.  Remove bacon
from pan, and drain.

Place potato chunks in the pan, and cook, turning
occasionally, until well browned and crisp.  Cut bacon
into 1 inch pieces, and add to potatoes. Immediately
pour eggs over the potato/bacon mixture, and cook,
stirring frequently, until soft-scrambled.

Spoon mixture into heated flour tortillas, and roll or
fold.

Serve with pico de gallo, hot sauce, chopped cilantro,
jalapeno peppers to be added as desired.

In actuality, the filling can be darn near anything
you have handy (eggs optional).  Leftover fajitas are
great, as is Mexican-style chorizo (which makes the
greasiest breakfast tacos known to man, if you don't
drain the cooked chorizo mixture VERY well before
adding the eggs). Cheese may be added to the mixture,
or sprinkled on the cooked ingredients before rolling.
