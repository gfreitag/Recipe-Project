Title: LACY OATMEAL-AND-WHEAT GERM COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 110 Servings
3/4 c  Walnut pieces
3/4 c  Unsalted butter; softened
1 1/2 c  Light brown sugar, packed
1 lg Egg
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Quick-cooking rolled oats
1/4 c  Wheat germ
2 tb Cake flour
PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F and adjust the rack to the middle level. Using
the food processor, chop the walnuts by turning the machine on and
off about 10 times; reserve them. Process the butter and sugar for 1
minute, or until the mixture is creamed and fluffy. Add the egg,
vanilla, cinnamon and salt and process the mixture for 1 minute,
stopping the machine once to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add
the rolled oats, wheat germ, flour and reserved nuts and combine the
batter by turning the machine on and off a couple of times, or until
the flour just disappears. Do not over-process it. Scrape down the
sides of the bowl once during processing. Batter will be very thin.
Drop the batter by the scant teaspoonful well apart on well greased
aluminum baking sheets that have been sprinkled with water. Do not
use Teflon-coated sheets. Place about 12 cookies on each
17-by-14-inch sheet. (These cookies spread while baking.) Bake for
6-to-8 minutes, or until they are browned. Let them rest on the
baking sheets for 2 minutes, then transfer them carefully and quickly
to wire racks with a metal spatula. If they cool before they are
removed from the baking sheet, return the sheet to the oven for 1
minute. Let the cookies cool completely before storing them in an
airtight container. ---
