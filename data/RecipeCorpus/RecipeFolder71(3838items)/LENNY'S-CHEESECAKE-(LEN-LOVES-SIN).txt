4    8-oz pkgs cream cheese; or 5
-(STORE brand; not Philly)
2 c  Sugar
1 ts REAL vanilla
6    Eggs; beaten
10 oz Sour cream
So here's the recipe for a crustless cheesecake given to me by my
friend of about 30 years; Len Simon. Soften cream cheese and beat
until SMOOTH. (I 'defrost' it in the nuker.) Add the sugar and
vanilla and beat well. Add the eggs and sour cream. Pour batter into
a buttered 10" round, 2" deep cake pan (or comparable springform).
Place pan in another pan of water about 1/2" deep (I use my broiler
pan) and bake @ 350 for 45 - 60 minutes or until top begins to turn a
light toast color. The cake will not be set. Remove from oven and
cool, then refrigerate for about 2 hours. If you have used a
springform pan, you can remove the cake and serve. I use the cake
pan, so I freeze the cake in the pan. To de-pan, I turn a stove
burner to high and move the pan around on the burner for about 45
seconds. Then I invert it over a plate. If the cake does not fall out
of the pan, I give it another turn on the burner for about 10 seconds
and try again. Sometimes, tapping the inverted pan on the bottom
hastens the process. I then either wrap the cake and replace in
freezer for later use or let it continue to defrost in the fridge.

AH, I guess these instructions are too detailed for you, but someone
else may need them.  Anyway, this is a very basic, creamy cake...good
served with canned toppings, fresh fruit, sauce of your choice, etc.
It serves 10 to 16 people, depending on how many of them are watching
their weight or cholesterol.  Can be re-frozen. I like it as is, but
my uncle has added hazelnuts to the batter.  Who knows
