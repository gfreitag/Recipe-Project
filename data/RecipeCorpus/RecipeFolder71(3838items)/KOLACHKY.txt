Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water. Scald milk and set
aside until lukewarm, not cold. Cream butter and sugar
until light and fluffy. Add salt and mix again. Place
dissolved yeast in milk. Add 3 cups flour and beat
well. Stir in the creamed mixture and beat again. Then
add unbeaten eggs and blend. Gradually add remaining
flour, a tablespoon at a time, until dough is smooth
enough to handle, then knead in remaining flour on a
warmed board. The dough should be smooth and elastic
to the touch, never hard nor stiff. Place in a greased
bowl, cover, and allow to stand in a warm place about
2 1/2 hours until double in bulk. Place dough on a
warmed board, which has been slightly floured. Pat
down dough to about 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into 2
inch squares. Place a teaspoon of filling (recipe
below) on each square and gather up the 4 corners
carefully, folding one on top of the other, and press
together so that folded dough is thinner than dough
beneath the filling. When folded correctly, the
filling will peek through the four sides. Place on a
large cookie sheet about 2 inches apart. Let rise
until double in bulk in a warm place, about 45
minutes. Bake at 375-F for 25 minutes. When cool
sprinkle generously  with powered sugar. Makes about
six dozen cakes. PRUNE FILLING:
Wash prunes and cook in enough water to cover. Bring
to boil. When cool, strain, pit and chop well. Sweeten
and add cinnamon to taste or orange peel. Allow to
cool slightly before spreading. POPPY SEED FILLING:
Combine ingredients and cook about five minutes until
thick. APPLE FILLING:
Cook together about five or six minutes until apples
are soft. Cool.
