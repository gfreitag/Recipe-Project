Cut the tempeh in half the short way, then diagonally, yielding 4
triangles.  Mix the remaining ingredients into a marinade, and
marinate the tempeh for a couple of hours. Drain off and reserve most
of the marinade, keep a little bit in the bottom of the roasting
dish, and broil the tempeh in this for about 5 minutes on each side.
