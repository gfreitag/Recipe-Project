MAIDS OF HONOUR

PASTRY

water Few drops Almond extract

To make pastry, sift flour and salt into a bowl.  Add 1/3 of the
butter or margarine and rub in until the mixture resembles
breadcrumbs. Add enough water to make an elastic dough. Roll out to
an oblong on a lightly floured board.  Cut the remaining fat into
small pieces. Dot 2/3 of the dough with half the fat pieces. Bring up
the uncovered dough third and fold in three like an envelope.  Turn
the pastry so that the open end faces you and roll out again into an
oblong. Repeat with the remainig fat, fold and turn. Roll out, fold
and chill.

Roll out the dough until it is wafer thin.  Cut out 12-15 circles to
line a fairly deep 3" muffin tin. Put a tsp of jam into each tin. Mix
together all the remaining filling ingredients, beating well. Spoon
into the pastry tins over the jam. Bake in a hot to very hot oven,
450 o - 475o F for 10 min. Reduce oven temperature to moderate, 350 o
and bake for 15 mins. Allow to cool.

For the topping, blend the confectioners sugar with enough water to
make a flowing consistency.  Mix in the almond extract. Spoon a
little on each little cake and let set to harden.
