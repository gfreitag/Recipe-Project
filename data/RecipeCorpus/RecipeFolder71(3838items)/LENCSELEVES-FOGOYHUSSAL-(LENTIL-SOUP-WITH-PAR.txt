Categories: Soups/stews, Game, Fowl, Hungary
Yield: 6 Servings
2 ea Partridges
1 c  Lentils
6 c  Broth, chicken
1 lb Veal bones
1 md Carrots; peeled
1 ea Parsnip; peeled
1 ea Celery knob; peeled
1/4 lb Bacon, smoked
2 tb Flour, all-purpose
1 sm Onions; chopped
1/2 ts Mustard, prepared
1/3 c  Heavy cream
Soak partridges in cold water 3-4 hours. Place lentils in soup pot
with chicken broth, veal bones, carrot, parsnip and celery. Slowly
bring to a boil.
Cut smoked bacon into small dice and render fat. With slotted spoon
remove cracklings and set aside.
Dry partridges. Very quickly brown the whole bird in the bacon
drippings, giving them some color. Remove partridges and place in
soup pot with lentils.
Make a roux with the same fat used to brown the partridges and the
flour and onion. Add 1/2 cup cold water and whip until smooth.
When partridges and lentils are done, about 2 hours, add liquified
roux. Cook for an additional 10 minutes. Take out partridges and bone
them. Replace meat chunks in soup. Just before serving, whip mustard
and cream into the soup.

Note: partridges can be one of the toughest birds in the world, and
the 2 hour cooking time may be longer. This is an excellent way to
prepare what would otherwise be a very tough bird.
