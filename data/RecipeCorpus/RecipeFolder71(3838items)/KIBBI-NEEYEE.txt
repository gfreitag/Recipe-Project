Wash wheat several times in cold water.  Allow wheat
to stand in water for about 1 hour.  Grind meat and
onions fine. Mix with seasonings and wheat. If
necessary, moisten hands in small bowl filled with
cold water. Thorough mixing or kneading of the mixture
is very important. Kibbi may be fried, baked plan,
broiled or baked with a filling. When using a filling,
spread half of kibbi into 10x10" pan that has been
greased with butter; be sure to bring mixture all the
way to the edge of pan. Add filling. Top with other
half of kibbi.  Run knife around edge of the pan to
help seal layers together.  Cut, no deeper than top
layer, into 0 minutes or until brown. Serves 10 to 12.
