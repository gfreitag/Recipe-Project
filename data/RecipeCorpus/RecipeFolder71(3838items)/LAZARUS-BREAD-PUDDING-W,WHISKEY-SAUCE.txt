Title: LAZARUS BREAD PUDDING W/WHISKEY SAUCE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 10 Servings
3/4 lb Bread, French or Sourdough
1/4 c  Pecans, toasted
4 oz Butter, melted
MMMMM------------------------CUSTARD MIX-----------------------------
2 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
8 x  Eggs, large
5 1/2 c  Milk
1 ts Vanilla
MMMMM-----------------------WHISKEY SAUCE----------------------------
8 oz Butter, melted
2 c  Powdered sugar, sifted
2 x  Eggs, large, beaten well
1 oz Whiskey
CUSTARD: Break bread into medium pieces. Add pecans and melted butter.
Arrange in 9x13 pan.

Blend eggs, salt and sugar lightly with wire whip. Add vanilla and
milk. Blend and strain.  Pour over bread and nuts in pan.

Bake at 350oF. in pan of water* for 20-25 minutes. Test with knife.

*Note: for custard to bake properly, you must create this double
boiler effect.  Plan size of pan accordingly.

WHISKEY SAUCE: Melt butter. Whip in sifted powdered sugar. Fold in
eggs. Add whiskey. Serve warm.

I usually reheat this in the microwave before serving just to ensure
that the eggs are *cooked* thoroughly.

I have used butterscotch schnapps instead of whiskey and it was
delicious!
