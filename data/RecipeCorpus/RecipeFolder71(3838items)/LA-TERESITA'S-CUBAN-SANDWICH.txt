MOJO SAUCE
3 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Water
3 tb Olive oil
3 tb Chopped parsley
3/4 ts Minced garlic
1 ts Dried oregano
1/2 ts Salt
4    Cuban or Portuguese rolls,

8    Slices Virginia ham;

16    Slices roast pork (see Note)
- (abt 12 oz)
8    Slices Genoa salami;
- (abt 4 oz)
4    Slices Swiss cheese;

Put sauce ingredients in a jar. Cover and shake until blended. For
each sandwich: Drizzle 1 tablespoon sauce on bottom half of roll. Top
with 2 slices each ham, roast pork and salami, then 1 slice Swiss
cheese. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon sauce and cover with top of bun.

NOTE: To make Cuban-seasoned roast pork: Rub 1 teaspoon each minced
garlic, oregano and salt on a 1 3/4-pound boneless pork-loin roast.
Roast on rack in 450 F oven 60 minutes, or until meat thermometer
inserted in center reads 160 F. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.

This hearty sandwich makes great use of leftover roast pork. We've
included a recipe for Cuban-Seasoned Roast Pork (see Note) in case
you don't have any leftovers ready to use for this recipe. You may
also be able to find roast pork in the deli section of your market.
The sandwich is dressed with a sauce for which only La Teresita's
owner knows the recipe. All he gave us to go on is that it's called
mojo, which is a combination of olive oil with any citrus juice, any
herb and any member of the lily family--garlic, onion or shallots,
for example. Here's what we came up with.
