Title: KOKIS
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Egg
250 g  Rice flour
1/2 ts Turmeric
1/4 ts Salt
1    Litre oil
Beat the egg.  Sieve flour into a bowl and add the
egg,  turmeric, salt and sufficient  coconut  milk  to
make a thick batter. Heat the oil and when bubbling
hold the kokis mould in the oil until the mould is
hot. Carefully dip the mould into the batter, taking
care not to submerge it completely. Remove from the
batter and place in the hot oil where the batter
should separate from the mould but still retain its
shape as it deep fries. If the batter sticks it may
need to be eased from the mould with a wooden
toothpick. Repeat the process until all the batter is
used. From: "A taste of Sri Lanka" by Indra
