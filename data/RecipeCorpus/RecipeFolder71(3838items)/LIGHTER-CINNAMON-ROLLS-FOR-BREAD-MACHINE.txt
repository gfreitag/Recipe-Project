brush with the melted margarine or spray with the non-fat butter
spray. Combine sugars and cinnamon and sprinkle evenly over the
dough. 3. Roll up dough, jelly-roll fashion, starting with the long
edge. Pinch edges together and slice into 12 rolls. Place, cut side
down, onto baking sheet. Cover and let rise in a warm place until
doubled, about 45 minutes. 4. Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake 15 to 20
minutes, being careful not to burn rolls. Remove from oven and

sugar and milk and drizzle 1/2 to 1 teaspoon over each roll.
