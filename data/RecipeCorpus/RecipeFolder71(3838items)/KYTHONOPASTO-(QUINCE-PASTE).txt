Categories: Greek, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings

Pulp from Kythoni Peltes
Granulated sugar
Water
Bay leaves
Caster sugar
Cooking time: 45-50 minutes.

Puree quince pulp by pressing through a sieve or
process in food processor. Measure puree into a heavy
pan.  Add 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water to each cup of
pulp.  Set over medium heat and stir occasionally
until sugar is dissolved.

Bring to the boil, then boil steadily for 40-45
minutes, stirring occasionally so that paste cooks
evenly.  As paste is thick, it has a tendency to
scorch, so watch carefully.

When cooked, paste comes away from sides of pan and is
dark red in colour. Spread while hot into an oiled
slab cake pan so that it is 2 cm (3/4 inch) thick.
Leave in pan at room temperature for 2-3 days, lightly
covered with muslin.

When dry and firm, cut into small diamond shapes with
an oiled knife. Lift out and place in a container with
bay leaves between layers.  Seal tightly.

When serving, dip tops lightly into caster sugar to
give pieces a fine coating.  Kythonopasto keeps
indefinitely stored at room temperature and is
traditionally served in place of a spoon sweet,
accompanied with a glass of iced water.
