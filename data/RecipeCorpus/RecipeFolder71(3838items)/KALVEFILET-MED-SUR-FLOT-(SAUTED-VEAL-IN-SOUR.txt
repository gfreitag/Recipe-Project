Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in

or until transparent. Remove to a small bowl and set
aside. Add the remaining butter and oil to the skillet
and when the foam subsides, add the veal scallops. Fry
them over moderate heat until they are light golden
brown, 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Remove to a heated
platter and keep warm in a 220øF oven while you make
the sauce. Pour off all but a thin film of fat from
the skillet and add the cooked onions. Cook over high

and the sauce is smooth; do NOT allow it to come to a
boil. Taste for seasoning and return veal to the
skillet. Baste the meat with sauce and let simmer
uncovered for 1 or 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
