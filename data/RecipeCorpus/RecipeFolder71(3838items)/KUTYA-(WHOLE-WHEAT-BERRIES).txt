about 3 minutes, or until the water runs clear.
Combine4 1/2 c water and the salt in a heavy saucepan

Set aside, 	Toast the flour and almonds in a nonstick
skillet over medium-high heat, stirring constantly
with a wooden spoon and shaking the pan occasionally,

the almonds are lightly toasted. Transfer the mixture

golden raisins, and mix until well blended. Mix in the
wheat berries.  Taste and adjust the cinnemon and
