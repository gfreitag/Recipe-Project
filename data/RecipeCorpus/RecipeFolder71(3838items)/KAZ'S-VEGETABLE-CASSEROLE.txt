Title: KAZ'S VEGETABLE CASSEROLE
Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables, Beans
Yield: 2 Servings
4    Mushrooms
2    Onions
5    Mange tout
220 g  Chick peas
400 g  Tomatoes with chili spices
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 tb Natural or hazelnut yoghurt
1 tb White wine vinegar
2 ts Brown mustard seeds
White grape juice is just as good as white wine if you
want to avoid the alcohol. The recipe works well
without either. Preparation: chop the onions into 2cm
pieces and finely dice the mushrooms.
Add all the vegetables to a casserole dish, then add
the spices, chickpeas, yoghurt and white wine. If
possible leave to marinate for a couple of hours to
let the vegetables absorb the taste. Microwave on high
(650w oven) for 15 minutes, or longer if you want the
vegetables to be soft rather than crunchy - say 20
minutes. Serve with Biryani rice - I use brown rice
with lentils, almonds, sultanas and a mixture of
vegetables such as carrots and broccoli.
