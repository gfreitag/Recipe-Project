Categories: Desserts

Macaroon Stuffed Peaches w/Raspberry Sauce

Sugar to taste

Dip the peaches in boiling water to cover and leave them for 2 to 3
minutes--no longer.  Drain and refigerate without peeling. Grind the
macaroons in a food processor and season them to taste with your
choice of liqueur, so that you have a rather soft macaroon paste. One
to 2 hours before serving, peel the peaches and cut them in half.
Fill the cavities of the peach halves with the macaroon paste. Put
the stuffed peach halves together to form whole peaches, and place
them in a bowl. To make the sauce, put the raspberries in a blender
or processor. Blens and sweeten to taste with sugar. Spoon the sauce
over the peaches and chill before serving.
