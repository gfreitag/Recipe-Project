600 g  Kumara

Traditionally this recipe from the American Deep South
is used to fill a pie shell. But if you prefer, it is
just as delicious if you skip the pastry and bake the
filling in individual souffle pots standing in a bain
marie (or one large one). The result has a rich
complexity of flavour that belies how easy it is to
make. A dollop of King Island cream or mascarpone on
the side goes well.

Steam 600 g kumara, peeled and cut into chunks. until
tender. Place the cooked kumara in a food processor
and add 300 ml milk, 150 g brown sugar, half teaspoon
ground cinnamon, half teaspoon ground nutmeg, pinch
ground cloves, 3 tablespoons rum, 2 eggs and 60 g
melted butter. Process to a puree.

Either: line a 23 cm pie dish with short or biscuit
pastry and pour in the kumara puree, or pour the puree
into individual souffle dishes (or one large one) and
stand them in a baking dish containing water to come
halfway up the sides of the dishes.

Bake in a 220 C oven for 10 minutes, then reduce the
heat to 150 C and bake until the puree is just firm,
40 to 60 minutes. Do not overcook.
