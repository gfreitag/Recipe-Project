Categories: Thai, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Coconut cream
4 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
4    Ripe mangoes
3 c  Sticky coconut rice
Mix the coconut cream with the sugar and salt, and bring to a boil.
Simmer for a few minutes, stirring occasionally.

Peel the mangoes and slice them, removing the stones. Arrange the
mangoes on individual plates with rice beside them. Spoon the sauce
over the rice.

COCONUT RICE (Khao Man):

Coconut rice can be prepared with another ordinary or sticky rice,
depending on what sort of dish it is to be served with. If using
sticky rice, soak it first in plenty of water for at least two hours,
but preferably overnight

If prepared with ordinary rice, serve with Salted Sun-Dried Beef (Nua
Dad Diao) or other savoury dishes. Sticky coconut rice is delicious
with mangoes.

2 cups rice 2 cups water 1 cup coconut cream Salt

Rinse and drain the rice and put into a pan with the water, coconut
cream and salt.  Mix well

Bring to the boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat and cover.

Simmer for 10 minutes.

When all the liquid has been absorbed, cook for a few more minutes
over low heat.  The resulting slight burning of the rice at the
bottom of the pan gives extra flavour to this dish.

All these are from "Discover Thai Cooking" by Chaslin, Canungmai and
Tettoni, Times Editions, Singapore. 1987.

These are typical of the "street food" that one buys from the vendors
with mini-kitchens on pushcarts all over Thailand. Thai desserts and
confections tend to nastily/heavenly sweet and rich. You might be
careful using the amount of salt called for in these recipes. The
Thais tend to like their stuff saltier than we would. They even make
lemonade with salt instead of sugar!
