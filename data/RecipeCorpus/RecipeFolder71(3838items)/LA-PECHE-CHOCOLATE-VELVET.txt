This is one of Louisville's most celebrated chocolate desserts.
Chocolate velvet earned its reputation at the Four Seasons restaurant
in New York City, under the hands of pastry chef Albert Kumin, who
later became the White House pastry chef.  Fritschner writes: "It's
based on the bombe concept - lining a container with cake, filling it
with creamy filling (in this case  mousse) and finishing the
turned-out dessert with a glossy chocolate glaze."

When Kathy and Will Cary opened La Peche gourmet carry-out in 1979,
she added her adaptation of Kumin's recipe to the deli's offerings.
Chocolate velvet has never left the dessert case since then, as it's
so popular. As many as 50 chocolate velvets are sold there a week,
made by pastry chef Scott Bieber.

Line a 2 1/2 qt. souffle dish with plastic wrap.  Cut the pound cake
into thin slices.  Line the bottom and sides of the souffle dish with
overlapping pieces of pound cake, so there are no openings. Put 2
layers of pound cake on the bottom, to prevent leaks.  Sprinkle 2 tb.
of the amaretto around the pound cake.  Set aside.

To prepare mousse:  In a bowl, combine 1/3 c. amaretto, the rum,
chopped candy bars, melted butter, egg yolks and coffee. Stir well.

In a double boiler, melt 1 1/2 lbs. of chocolate. Remove from heat and
allow it to cool a little.  Whip the cream until stiff; set aside.
With clean beaters, whip the egg whites with a pinch of salt until
stiff. Slowly add 1 tb. powdered sugar and beat 1 minute. Slowly add
the chocolate to the liquor mixture, stirring well to combine evenly.
Fold in the whipped cream and egg whites.  Pour into prepared souffle
dish.

Use the rest of the pound cake to cover the top of the mousse,
overlapping pieces.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least
10 hours.

To make the icing: Melt 1/2 lb. of chocolate.  Use an electric mixer
to beat in the powdered sugar.  Add the coffee as needed to make a
smooth icing.  (It resembles a buttercream. It is very smooth and
thick enough to spread.)  Let the icing cool a bit before spreading
on the cake.

To ice the cake: Invert the chocolate velvet on a serving plate.
Remove plastic wrap.  Spread with icing. Refrigerate. To serve, cut
like cake. Serve with creme fraiche or whipped cream, if desired.

Make chocolate leaves by running a spatula under a thin layer of
tempered chocolate before it is set. Garnish velvet.

Keeps well up to 10 days refrigerated and freezes beautifully for up
to six months.
