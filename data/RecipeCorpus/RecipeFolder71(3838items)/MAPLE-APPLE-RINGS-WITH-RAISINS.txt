Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings

* The apples should be peeled, cored, cut into 5 rings.

Arrange apples in a shallow baking dish; sprinkle with lemon juice to
prevent darkening. Microwave covered at High for 4 - 5 minutes until
rings are tender, carefully rearranging once. Pour off accumulated
juice and reserve. Meanwhile, in a 2-cup glass measure, combine maple
syrup with cornstarch until smooth. Add raisins and butter and juices
from cooking apples. Microwave sauce at High for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes
until sauce comes to a full boil and thickens, stirring twice. Pour
sauce over apple rings. Serve warm or at room temperature over
pancakes, crepes or waffles.
