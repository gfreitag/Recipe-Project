Title: LEMON PRESSED CABBAGE
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Head savoy cabbage
1    Handful (1*cup?) fresh cloud
Ear mushroom (or
Reconstituted dry, I
Presume would be fine).
1/2    Lemon
1 1/2 ts Salt
Remove rib from each leaf cabbage.  Chop leaves into 1 inch squares
(approximately).  Chop mushrooms into 1/2 inch squares
(approximately). Slice lemon very thin and quarter slices. Mix
everything and press in pickle press for an hour or so.  Drain off
liquid and serve.

Nice, crunchy, refreshing, and good.

Refering to the book, I see that the closest recipe looks even
better: they use chinese cabbage instead of savoy, sliver the ribs
and add them (duh), and add fresh ginger. Hmmm. Maybe next time. Oh,
they used less mushroom (no don't do that).
