Only use Brisket. DO NOT USE GROUND BEEF. The best
chili is made from slow simmered brisket.

Brown the brisket with a little oil. Drain and remove
meat. Saute onion and garlic in the left over oil. Add
all the spices and let pan roast. Add the beef back to
the pot and add the tomato paste, tomato sauce, water,
V8 juice, tomato, jalapeno, and beer. Cover and simmer
for 3 hr. Add more beer if chili gets too dry.
