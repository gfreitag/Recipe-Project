Title: LEMON RUMCAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
1/2 c  Chopped pecans
18 1/2 oz Yellow cake mix
3 1/4 oz Instant lemon pudding mix
1/2 c  Rum
1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Oil
4    Eggs
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
1 c  Sugar
1/4 lb Butter
1/4 c  Lemon juice
Zest from one lemon
1/4 c  Rum
Directions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grease and flour a Bundt pan
(or a 11" diameter decorative jello ring mold). Put chopped nuts in
the bottom of the pan. Put cake and pudding mixes in a large mixing
bowl and add the rum, water oil and eggs. Mix for 2 minutes. Bake at
325 for 50-60 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean.

When the cake is almost done, prepare the glaze by boiling and
stirring the sugar, butter, lemon juice and lemon rind for 2-3
minutes. Remove from heat, let cool slightly, and then stir in the
rum.

Remove cake from oven and spoon hot glaze over the bottom, but mostly
between the cake and the sides (and center) of the pan. Let soak in
and carefully turn cake out of pan when cool.
