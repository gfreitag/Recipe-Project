This recipe is the same as my recipe for Chicken Curry except that
since the coconut milk is so high in fat I decided to try to come up
with a substitute.  This is the resulting formulation. It turns out
to be a very good substitute and the only thing I found needed to be
changed is that this recipe required quite a bit of stirring at the
beginning to keep the yogurt from coming out of suspension when the
cold or room temperature chicken is added.  Combine the yogurt and
milk in a blender bowl and process until well mixed. Add the Equal
sweetener and pulse blender to mix. Add the artificial coconut
extract to the mixture and adjust to taste if necessary.  In a large
saucepan, combine coconut milk with curry base over medium heat until
oil appears on top. Add chicken, seasoning sauce, lemon juice and
simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add remaining
ingredients except mushrooms and garlic chili sauce. Cover and simmer
for 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and garlic chili sauce to taste. Cover
and simmer 2 minutes. Serve hot over rice. Garnish with sprigs of
fresh sweet basil. From: Syd's Cookbook.
