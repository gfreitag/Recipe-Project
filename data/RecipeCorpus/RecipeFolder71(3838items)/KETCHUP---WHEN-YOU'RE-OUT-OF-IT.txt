Title: KETCHUP - WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF IT
Categories: Info/tips
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Tomato sauce
1/4 c  Sugar
ds Cinnamon
1 tb Vinegar
Pour the tomato sauce into a small sauce pan, and then
just boil away some of the water until it begins to
thicken. Now add the other ingredients and simmer for
3 or 4 minutes.

If you need the catsup for cooked mixtures, just
combine the ingredients above and add to your recipe
in place of catsup. Only need to cook it if you plan
to use it as a garnish, on hot dogs, etc.
