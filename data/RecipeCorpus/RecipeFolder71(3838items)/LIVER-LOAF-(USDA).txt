Title: LIVER LOAF (USDA)
Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
4 1/4 lb Beef liver -- sliced
1/2 c  Melted fat or oil
2    Beef bouillon cubes
2 c  Hot water
2 lb Bulk pork sausage
2 c  Dry fine breadcrumbs
8 lg Eggs -- beaten
2 tb Instant minced onion
4 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1 tb Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1 tb Celery salt
GARNISH -----
Crisp bacon pieces
Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot).

Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
served without freezing.

Grease other shallow baking pans for cooking the liver. Place the
liver slices in the pans.  Brush with melted fat. Brown in oven for
20 minutes. Drain. Put liver through food chopper. Dissolve bouillon
cubes in hot water.  Mix liver and bouillon with remaining
ingredients. Press one-fourth of the mixture into each baking pan.
Pack mixture tightly to avoid air pockets.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Bake
45 minutes or until loaf is done in center. Garnish with bacon piece.

TO FREEZE:  Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food.
Put edges of wrap together and fold several times so paper lies
directly on top of food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and
seal with freezer tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing,
and last date the food should be used for best eating quality (about
6 months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing
packages from the pans.

TO HEAT FROZEN LOAF:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Remove
freezer wrap.  Place loaf in baking pan. Bake 1 1/4 hours or until
loaf is done in center. Garnish with crisp bacon piece.
