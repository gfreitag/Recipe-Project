COMMENTS: As the name implies, a chiffon cake is a light, high cake -
actually a hybrid of an angle and butter cake. Serve this cake plain,
with lemon curd, with whipped cream or with a nest of strawberries in
the center. Lightly grease a 10-inch tube or bundt cake pan. Preheat
oven to 325'F. Sift together the cake flour, sugar, baking powder and
salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add oil, lemon
juice, water, egg yolks and lemon zest. Beat until smooth. Beat egg
whites until foamy, then dust with cream of tartar. Beat until the
whites are stiff and glossy-looking. Stir 1/4 of the beaten egg
whites into the cake batter. Gently fold in the remaining egg whites.
Pour into prepared tube or bundt pan. Bake about 55 minutes in
preheated oven until cake tests done. Remove from oven and invert
pan. Let cake cool this way for about 1 hour. To loosen the cake for
serving , run a knife around the edges. Unmold on to serving plate
and glaze, if desired, then garnish with shreds of lemon zest. LEMON
GLAZE: Combine two cups sifted icing sugar and three tablespoons of
fresh lemon juice to make a thin glaze.
