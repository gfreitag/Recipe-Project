Title: LEMON HERBAL ICE CREAM
Categories: Ice cream
Yield: 1 Batch
1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
1 1/2 c  Milk
2/3 c  Sugar
3    Egg yolks
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/2    Lemon; zest only
2 tb Lemon juice; fresh
1/4 c  Lemon verbena leaves*
1/4 c  Lemon balm leaves*
1 tb Lemon balm leaves; chopped
* leaves are measured by "hardpacking:" press down in the measuring
cup with your fingers

In a heavy 2-quart saucepan or double boiler over medium-low heat,
stir and heat the cream, milk, and sugar until the sugar dissolves.
Do not boil.

In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks lightly. While whisking, pour 1
cup of the hot cream mixture into the bowl, then pour the egg mixture
back into the saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Stir
constantly with a wooden spoon (don't let the mixture boil; it could
curdle) for about 8 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and coats
the spoon. To test for doneness, dip a metal spoon into the mixture
and run your finger across the back. The custard is done when your
finger leaves a clear, clean trail. A candy thermometer should read
175-180 degrees F.

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Stir in the
lemon peel, lemon juice, and hard-packed lemon herbs into the hot
ice-cream base. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1
hour (the longer it is refrigerated, the stronger the flavor will be).

Strain the mixture and add the chopped lemon balm leaves for color.
Pour the mixture into an ice-cream maker and freeze according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
