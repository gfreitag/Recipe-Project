Title: MADELEINES-MARTHA STEWART LIVING
Categories: Cookies, Soup/stews
Yield: 36 Cookies
1/2 c  (1 stick) plus 2 T unsalted
-butter, melted and cooled
4 lg Eggs
1/4 ts Salt
2/3 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  (scant) finely sifted all-
-purpose flour
1    Lemon, for zest
Confectioners' sugar, for
-sprinkling
1. Heat oven to 350'. Brush Madeleine molds with 2 T butter. (Or use
vegetable spray or nonstick molds.)

2. Beat eggs at low speed, gradually adding salt and sugar. Increase
speed as batter becomes light and fluffy. After about 7 minutes,
reduce speed to low and add vanilla. Turn off mixer. Fold in flour in
batches to prevent lumps: Add a batch and turn mixer on for 2
seconds, then off. Repeat until flour is used up.

3. Add 1/2 C melted butter to batter using same on-off technique. Do
not overbeat. Incorporate stray flecks of flour with a rubber
spatula. Scrape 1 t lemon zest into batter.

4. Spoon batter into each mold, about three-quarters full. Bake 10
minutes, or until madeleines are firm in center. Immediately turn out
onto wire rack and let cool to room temperature.
