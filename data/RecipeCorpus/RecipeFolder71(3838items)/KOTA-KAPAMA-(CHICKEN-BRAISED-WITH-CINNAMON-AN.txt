Title: KOTA KAPAMA (CHICKEN BRAISED WITH CINNAMON AN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 5 Servings
1    Frying or roasting chicken*
1    Lemon (juice only)
4 tb Sweet butter & oil, mixed
1/2 c  Dry white wine (optional)
1 1/2 lb Peeled, chopped tomatoes
1 tb Tomato paste; mixed w/ water
1/4 c  -Water to mix w tomato paste
1    Large stick cinnamon
3    Whole cloves
Salt & freshly ground pepper
Fresh parsley or watercress
*Note: Chicken should be about 2-1/2 lbs., and be cut
into serving pieces.

Arrange the chicken parts in a glass or earthenware
bowl and rub all over with lemon juice.  Allow to
stand while heating the butter and oil in a heavy
braising pot. Slip the chicken into the fat and cook
over medium heat, turning with tongs to avoid pricking
the flesh; saute until light chestnut in color.  Heat
the wine in a small pan, pour over the chicken, shake
the pan, and continue cooking over low heat. Stir in
the tomatoes and tomato paste, slip the cinnamon and
cloves in among the pieces, and cover. Simmer over the
lowest possible heat for 1-1/2 hours, or until the
chicken is tender and the sauce thick. Or, transfer to
a medium slow oven (325 F) to complete the cooking.
Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm over cooked
grain or mashed potatoes with green raw or cooked
vegetables and chilled wine.  Garnish with parsley or
watercress.
