1/2 c  Light corn syrup
1/2 c  Water
2 tb Water
1 pn Salt
2    Egg whites
35    Unwrapped Kraft caramels
2/3 c  Whole roasted almonds

1.  In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, corn
syrup, 1/2 cup of the water, and the salt. Heat to boiling, then cook
using a candy thermometer to monitor thetemperature. 2. Beat the egg
whites until they are stiff and form peaks. Don't use a plastic bowl
for this. 3. When the sugar mixture reaches 270 degrees F, or the
soft-crackstage, remove from the ehat and pour the mixture in thin
streams into the egg whites, blending completely with an electric
mixer set on low. 4. Continue to mix about 20 minutes, or until the
nougat begins to harden and thickens to the consistency of dough.
Mix in the almonds. 5. Press the nougat into a greased 9x9-inch pan
and chill until form, about 30 minutes. 6. Melt the caramels with the
remaining 2 tablespoons water in a small saucepan oer medium heat. 7.
Pour the caramel over the nougat and return the pan to the
refrigerator. 8.  When the caramel and nougat are firm (about 30
minutes), slice down  the middle of the pan with a sharp knife, and
then slice across into 7 segments to make a total of 14 bars. 9. Melt
the milk chocolate chips in a microwave for 2 minutes on half power,
stirring halfway through the cooking time. Melt completely, but be
careful not to overheat. 10. Resting bar on a for (and using your
fingers if needed), dip each bar into the chocolate to coat
completely and tap the fork against the side fo the bowl to knock off
the excess chocolate.  Place on waxed paper and let cool at room
temperature until the chocolate is firm, 1 to 2 hours. Makes 14 candy
bars.
