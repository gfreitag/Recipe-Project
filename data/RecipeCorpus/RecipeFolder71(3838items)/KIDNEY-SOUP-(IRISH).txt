Skin the kidney, cut down the middle and remove the

can give a kidney a bad taste, so be thorough.)  Heat
the fat and brown the kidney in it quickly.  Pour off
any excess fat, then stir in the flour, turning the
kidney pieces in it.  Cook for 1 minute, then add the
stock, sugar, bouquet garni, and the spice bag.
Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer gently for

Cool the soup, then refrigerate.  When it is quite
cold take off any fat from the top, then remove the
bouquet garni and spice bags.  Taste for seasoning;
add the lemon juice and sherry if needed.  If the
pieces of kidney are not liked, strain the soup;  or
it can be liquidized.  Bring to just under boiling
point before serving;  serve with thin slices of dry
toast, or cheese biscuits.
