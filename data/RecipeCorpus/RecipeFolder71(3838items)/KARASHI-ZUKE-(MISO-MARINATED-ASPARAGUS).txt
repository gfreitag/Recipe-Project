Title: KARASHI ZUKE (MISO-MARINATED ASPARAGUS)
Categories: Appetizers, Japanese, Vegetables
Yield: 10 Servings
6 ea Asparagus stalks; peeled
1/2 c  Shiro miso
1 tb Mustard, powdered
Snap the tips from the asparagus and save for future
use.  Slice the stalks lengthwise into strips 1/2"
wide, then cut these into 1 1/2" lengths. Over high
heat, bring 2 c water to a boil.  Add the asparagus,
return to the boil, and drain immediately in a sieve.
Run under cold water to cool them quickly, and pat dry
with paper towels.

In a small mixing bowl, combine the miso with the dry
mustard & mix until smooth.  Spread half the mixture
in a shallow baking dish & cover with a double
thickness of cheesecloth the size of the dish. Place
the asparagus in one layer on the cheesecloth & cover
with another double thickness of cheesecloth.  Top
with the remaining miso & mustard mixture.  Marinate
for about 3 hours at room temperature, or refrigerate
overnight.

Discard the dressing before serving the asparagus.
