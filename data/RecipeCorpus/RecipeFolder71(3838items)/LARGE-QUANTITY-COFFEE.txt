(Soak and rinse sack thoroughly before using.) Tie sack, allowing
sufficient length of cord for fastening to handle of kettle.

Heat measured amount of cold water to full rolling boil; reduce heat.
Tie sack to handle; submerge in water. Keep kettle over low heat.

8 minutes. When coffee is done, remove sack, permitting all extract
