Title: LICORICE CHUNK ICE CREAM
Categories: Ice cream
Yield: 1 Batch
1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
1 1/2 c  Milk
2/3 c  Sugar
3    Egg yolks
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 tb Aniseed
1/2 c  Black licorice whips;chopped
In a heavy 2-quart saucepan or double boiler over medium-low heat,
stir and heat the cream, milk, and sugar until the sugar dissolves.
Do not boil.

In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks lightly. While whisking, pour 1
cup of the hot cream mixture into the bowl, then pour the egg mixture
back into the saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Stir
constantly with a wooden spoon (don't let the mixture boil; it could
curdle) for about 8 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and coats
the spoon. To test for doneness, dip a metal spoon into the mixture
and run your finger across the back. The custard is done when your
finger leaves a clear, clean trail. A candy thermometer should read
175-180 degrees F. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
vanilla.

With a mortar and pestle, roughly crush the aniseed, or place the
seeds in a plastic bag and bruise them with a hammer. Stir the
crushed seeds into the hot ice cream base. Cover and chill in the
refrigerator for at least 1 hour (the longer it is refrigerated, the
stronger the flavor will be).

Strain the mixture and add the chopped licorice pieces. Pour the
mixture into an ice-cream maker and freeze according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
