Title: LECITHIN PAN COATING
Categories: Misc
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Grain alcohol; or vodka
4 ts Lecithin, liquid
This is similar to "PAM".

Place grain alcohol & lecithin in a small jar & shake to mix.

If you don't like using grain alcohol, it says you can use vegetable
oil in its place.

You can brush this on but a small spray bottle works better. I found
that the bottle that throat spray comes in works great as it has a
real fine spray. This stuff is super.
