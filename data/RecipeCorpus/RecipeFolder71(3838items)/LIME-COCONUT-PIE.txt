Title: LIME COCONUT PIE
Categories: New, Text, Import
Yield: 8 Servings
Crust and topping:
3/4 c  Sugar cookie or graham
2 tb Cornmeal cracker crumbs
pn Of salt
2 1/4 c  Sweetened shredded coconut
1 1/4 c  Sugar
4 lg Eggs,, separated
1 tb Unsalted butter,, melted
2 lg Egg yolks
Lime curd:
4 tb Unsalted butter,, melted
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
3/4 c  Freshly squeezed lime juice
Finely grated zest of 1 lime
Combine the topping and crust ingredients. Press one half of the
mixture into the bottom and sides of an ungreased 10-inch glass or
ceramic pie plate, building up the sides to the top of the plate to
form an edge. Reserve remaining mixture for the topping. To make the
lime curd, combine the butter, lime juice, cornmeal, salt and 3/4 cup
of the sugar in a large bowl over a pan of simmering water with the
bottom not touching the water, and slowly cook, scraping the sides of
the bowl and whisking occasionally, another 15 minutes, or until
thickened. Cover with plastic and refrigerate. Stir the curd every 10
minutes or so to cool evenly.

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites
with the cream of tartar and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar until stiff
and glossy. Gently fold half of the beaten whites into the cool lime
curd to lighten. Then fold in the remaining whites and the lime zest.
(This should be very gentle; it is okay for a few streaks of white to
be showing.) Pour the filling into the pie shell and sprinkle on
reserved topping evenly to cover. Gently press the sides in so the
top 1/2 inch of the crust remains bare. Bake 45 minutes, or until the
pie has risen and coconut is golden brown. The filling should be
slightly cracked and firm when pressed in the center. Cool
completely, cover with plastic and refrigerate 6 hours to chill
thoroughly. Serve cold.
