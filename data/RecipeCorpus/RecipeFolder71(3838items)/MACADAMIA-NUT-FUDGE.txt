Butter an 8-inch-square baking pan. Line the bottom of the pan with
foil. In a large bowl, combine the butter, chocolate chips, macadamia
nuts, unsweetened chocolate, and vanilla. Attach a candy thermometer
to a medium saucepan. Add the sugar, evaporated milk, and
marshmallows. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly
to prevent burning. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture
reaches 238 degrees. Pour the hot mixture into the bowl and let stand
for 30 minutes. Stir until the mixture begins to thicken, about 1
minute. Spread evenly in the prepared pan. Let stand until completely
cooled. Cover with foil and let stand overnight to allow the flavors
to mellow. Invert the fudge and remove the foil. Reinvert and cut
into squares. Store the fudge at room temperature in an airtight
container. Makes about 2 pounds. Source: "An Edible Christmas"
