Categories: Poultry, Main dish, Greek
Yield: 6 Servings
3 ea Fryers (abt. 1 1/2 lb. ea.)
Salt & pepper to taste
1/2 c  Butter or oil
1 c  White wine
1 c  Hot water
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
Thoroughly clean and wash chickens.  Truss them,
and allow to drain. Sprinkle lightly with salt &
pepper.  Melt the butter in a frying pan. Brown the
chickens, one at a time, well on all sides, then place
them in a wide pot.  Pour in the fat remaining in the
frying pan, and place this pot over heat.  Pour in
wine slowly, so it steams, and add water.  Cover.
Simmer, adding more water if needed, for abt. 30 min.
When chickens are tender, remove from heat & cool
partially, then cut into quarters.  Add walnuts to the
sauce, stir, and bring the sauce to a boil.  Cook for
2 to 3 min. longer.  Add the quartered chix, and serve
hot with fried potatoes and a raw salad.
