Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/2 lb Stewing meat, cubed
2 c  Onion
1/4 ts Saffron
1/2 ts Black pepper
1 ts Lacama (see recipe)
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
1    Orange or lemon rind,
Cut into thin strips
1/2 c  Olive oil (poured over all)
1 c  Toasted almonds
Mix all ingredients. Cover and cook over medium-high fire, stirring
frequently, for 15 minutes. Add 3 cups hot water Re-cover, and
continue cooking until meat is done. Just before removing from fire,
add in, mixing with meat and remaining stock: 1 cup blanched, peeled,
and toasted almonds, ground or chopped; sprinkle almonds very lightly
with salt before toasting. [To heck with that: just chop almonds and
brown in frying pan.) If stew is too thick, a little water may be
added. Serve: Hot, immediately.
