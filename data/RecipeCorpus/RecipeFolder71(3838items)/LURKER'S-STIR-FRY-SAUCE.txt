Title: LURKER'S STIR FRY SAUCE
Categories: Digest, August
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Ketchup
x  Soy sauce
x  Honey
x  Vinegar (whatever kind you
Feel like)
x  Ginger (fresh or not)
x  Garlic (fresh or not)
x  Rosemary
x  Pepper
Usually I start with around 1/3c ketchup.  The original list had oil
in it, but I don't think it needs it. I make the sauce separately and
then dump it on near the end and only cook it down a little.

I'm new to this list and to some of the concepts, so if I've used any
evil ingredients, sorry.
