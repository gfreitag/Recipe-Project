"One of the most frequently asked questions of us here
at King Arthur Flour is, 'What is gluten?'  Gluten is
an element of the wheat berry that contains two
special proteins, gluten in and gliadin. When you are
making bread, and you add liquid to the flour, you get
these two proteins in business.  They start to
interact and form a web which traps the carbon dioxide
that the yeast is giving off. This web is developed
during the kneading process.  Wheat is the only grain
which contains gluten."

"To use gluten, we have found that adding a tablespoon
for each cup of flour called for in the recipe will
increase the rise in the bread from 25% to 30%.  The
proper way to measure the gluten is to put 1
tablespoon of the gluten in your measuring cup and
then spoon the flour into the cup on top of the
gluten. Level off the flour with the back of a knife."
