IF THE SHRIMP ARE UNPEELED, peel them by removing their shell, legs
and tail. Devein them by making a surface cut down the back of the
shrimp and removing the black, green or yellow matter. Rinse them
well under cold running water and pat them thoroughly dry with paper
towels. Rub the shrimp evenly with salt and set aside. Put the tea
leaves in a heat-proof measuring cup and pour in the hot water. Let
the tea steep for 15 minutes. Heat a wok or large saute pan until it
is hot and add the oil. Then add the shrimp and rice wine and
stir-fry for 30 seconds. Pour in the tea and half of the leaves and
cook for another minute. Remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon to a
serving platter and reduce any liquid in the wok by half. Pour this
over the shrimp and serve at once.
