Serves: 6, more as an appetizer
Cooking time: 15-20 minutes
Rinse sweetbreads, place in a pan and cover with
water. Add juice of 1/2 lemon. Bring to the boil, then
drain. Put liver, heart and halved kidneys in a bowl
with cold water to cover and add the juice of 1 lemon.
Soak for 30 minutes, then drain. Remove skin from
liver and trim larger tubes from liver and heart; cut
out fatty core from kidneys. Cut meats and sweetbreads
into 3 cm (1-1/4 inch) pieces and place in a glass or
ceramic bowl.
Blend marinade ingredients and pour over prepared
meats.  Cover and leave in refrigerator to marinate
for at least 2 hours.  Put sausage casings in cold
water and leave to soak during this time. Thread meats
alternately on 6 skewers, adding 2 pieces of bay leaf
to each skewer among meats.  Drain sausage casings and
wind a length of casing around meats on each skewer,
tucking ends in to keep casings in place. Grill slowly
over glowing charcoal, turning skewers frequently and
brushing kokoretsi occasionally with marinade.  Cook
for 15 to 20 minutes, adjusting height of grid, or
moving skewers to cooler part of fire so that
kokoretsi cooks slowly.  Serve hot.
