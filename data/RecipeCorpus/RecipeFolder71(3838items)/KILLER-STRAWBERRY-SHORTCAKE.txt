Title: KILLER STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE
Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Bisquick drop biscuits
1    French vanilla ice cream
1    Fresh sliced strawberries
1    Fresh whipped cream
This is a really easy dessert, loaded with calories, and not for the
faint-of-heart!

Make the bisquick drop biscuits as directed on the package, BUT add 1
tb of sugar (or 2, if you like). Bake as directed.

While still warm, cut in half and put the bottom half in a bowl.
Cover with fresh strawberries (which you have marinated in 4 Tb sugar
in the refrigerator for 2 days), add a scoop or two of French vanilla
ice cream, and then top with the top layer of the biscuit.

Now, cover with more strawberries and top with fresh whipped cream.
Enjoy!
