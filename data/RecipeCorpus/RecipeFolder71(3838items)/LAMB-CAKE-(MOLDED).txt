Categories: Cakes, Holiday, Easter
Yield: 1 Cake
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Butter
1 c  Milk
5    Egg whites
3 ts Baking powder
3 c  Flour; (cake flour preferred
1 ts Vanilla extract; or almond
; or lemon flavor
1    Two-part lamb cake mold
Preheat oven to 300 F.

Cream sugar and butter.  Sift flour and baking powder.  Add flour to
sugar/butter mixture alternately with milk.  Add flavoring.  Fold in
well-beaten egg whites [beaten to soft-peak stage].

Prepare mold [grease well with solid shortening and dust with flour,
or alternately, spray thoroughly with pan coating].  Fill face side
first, attach back side, and bake for 50 minutes.  Turn off oven.
Flip to bake back in turned-off oven for 10 minutes.

Ice with 7-minute Icing.  Sprinkle with white coconut (dye brown or
black for different-colored lambs).  Use small raisins for eyes and a
small red cinnamon candy for the nose. Lay Easter grass around and
tie pastel-colored ribbon around the neck.

"We have a mold that has been used in my family for generations at
children's birthdays.  The cake is an old-fashioned cake with a strong
texture, but tasty.  The presentation is wonderful..."
