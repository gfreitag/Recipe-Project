Title: KELIA AYAM - CHICKEN CURRY
Categories: Indonesian, Chicken
Yield: 6 Servings
8    Shallots, peeled and chopped
2    Garlic Cloves, peeled and
-chopped
4    Chopped Candlenuts *
2 tb Water
2 1/2 c  Thick Coconut Milk
1 ts Ground Ginger
1 ts Ground New Mexico Chili
1 ts Ground Turmeric
1    Salam or Bay Leaf
Salt to taste
3 1/2 lb Chicken cut up
Put the Shallots, Garlic, and Candlenuts in a blender
and work until smooth. Transfer to a deep pan or wok,
add the rest of the ingredients. Simmer 1 to 1 1/2
hours until the sauce is thick, then taste and add
more salt if necessary. Serve hot.

* I couldn't find Candlenuts when I made this, so used
Filberts instead! The curry turned out delicious
anyway.

P.S. That was supposed to be one 3 1/2 lb chicken in
the Ayam Goreng recipe, I notice it looks a little
confusing,
