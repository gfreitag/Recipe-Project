Title: LOUISE FRAZIER'S SOUTHERN CORN BREAD
Categories: Breads -, Quick
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 c  Cornmeal -- stone ground
3 tb Flour
2 tb Sugar
3 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 c  Buttermilk
2    Eggs -- well beaten
4 tb Dripping
Preheat the oven to 350F. Combine the dry ingredients and stir in the
wet. Pour the mixture into a lightly buttered 8" square pan and bake
for 40 minutes, checking after 30. This is a dense, chewy cornbread
and serves 6 to 8. Again, substitutions can be made: skim buttermilk,
Egg Beaters, and butter substitutes for the dripping and to grease
the pan. Do try to find stone ground cornmeal, though. It gives the
cornbread a wonderful flavor and texture. The batter may also be
fried in a large pan on to p of the stove, flipping it over so both
sides are crunchy.
