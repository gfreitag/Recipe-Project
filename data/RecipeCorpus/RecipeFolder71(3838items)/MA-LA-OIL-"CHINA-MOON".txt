Title: MA LA OIL "CHINA MOON"
Categories: Condiments, China
Yield: 2 1/2 cups
1 c  Oil, Corn or Peanut
1 c  Oil, Sesame, Japanese
1/2 c  Scallions, green & white
- cut in rings
15    Ginger quarter-size coins
- smashed
2 tb Peppercorns, Szechwan brown
2/3 c  Chile Flakes, dried red
-shockingly pungent
2 ts Salt, Kosher
Combine all ingredients in a heavy, non aluminum 1 1/2 quart
saucepan. Rest a deep-fry thermometer on the rim of the pot. Over
moderately low heat, bring the mixture to a bubbly 225 degrees
stirring occasionally. Let simmer for 15 minutes, checking to ensure
the temperature does not rise. Remove from the heat and let stand
until cool or overnight.

Strain the oil without pressing the solids; then, discard the solids.
Store the oil in an impeccably clean glass jar at cool room
temperature.

Because of the large proportion of sesame oil, this is a rich oil. A
little bit goes a long way. A spoonful added to a salad dressing or
brushed on the plate on which a fish will steam or on the skin of a
just smoked or roasted bird gives an inimitable touch of lushness. If
you are a bread baker, brush a bit on your next loaf, if you are
tossing pasta, drizzle a bit on the noodles just before serving.
