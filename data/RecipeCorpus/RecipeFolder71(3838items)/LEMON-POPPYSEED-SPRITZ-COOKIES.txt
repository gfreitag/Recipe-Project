Thoroughly cream butter or margarine and sugar. Add egg, vanilla,
lemon extract and lemon zest; beat well.

Sift together flour and baking powder; add gradually to creamed
mixture, mixing to a smooth dough. Force dough through cooky press,
using a star or swirl shape, onto ungreased baking sheet.

Bake in hot oven, 400 degrees 8 to 10 minutes. Cool.

Icing:  Sift the powdered sugar and add the lemon extract. Add the
milk a little at a time.  You want the result to be a thin frosting.
Add yellow food coloring and stir until blended. You want the color
of the frosting to be paler than the color of the cookies.

When the cookies are completely cool, put the frosting into a small
ziploc bag. Cut a small hole in one corner, and squeeze the bag to
force the thin frosting out the hole. Starting in the center of each
cookie, make a sprial of frosting going out toward the edges of the
cookie. Sprinkle with poppy seeds, and let the icing set.
