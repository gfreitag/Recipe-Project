Simmer foods in this sauce, as the foods absorb the salty taste, you
may need to add more soy sauce to compensate.

Do not use fish in this sauce if you want to keep it long.

Basic Sauce is used over and over again to slow-simmer a number of
foods. It imparts its own flavor to what is cooked, and grows more
savory with the cooking of different foods.
