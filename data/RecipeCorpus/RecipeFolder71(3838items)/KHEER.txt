1 tb Long grained rice

Combine themilk, rice, and cardamom pods in a
heavy-bottomed pot.  Bring to a boil.  Lower the heat
and reduce the milk until you have 2 cups.* This may
take 1-1 1/4 hours.  Turn off heat. Remove cardamom
pods and discard.  Add sugar and nuts,  Mix well and
leave to cool.  Mix again and pour into a serving
bowl.  Decorate with a few more slivered pistachios on
top.  Cover bowl with light plastic wrap. Refrigerate.
Serve cold.

*Note:  How to boil milk down
1 Use a very heavy-bottomed pot.  Cast iron or
aluminium covered with porcelain.
2 Since the process is slow and tedious bring a chair
and book to stove. 3 Bring the milk to an "almost"
boil.  Watch it.  If you let it boil over you will
have a big mess to clean.  As soon as it seems that
the milk will start to boil and rise, turn heat sown
to medium low. 4 Adjust heat so that milk is always
bubblingm but will not boil over. 5 Once the milk has
begun its slow boil, settle down with your book.  Stir
milk every few minutes. 6 If a creamy crust forms on
top, just stir it into the milk.  It will taste fine
when cold.
