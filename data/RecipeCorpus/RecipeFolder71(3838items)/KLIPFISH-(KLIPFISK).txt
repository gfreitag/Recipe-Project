Now watch this sleight of culinary hand as I
effortlessly slip across national boundaries and
across hemispheres to inextricably link the cuisines
of Denmark and Mexico.

Klipfish is salted dried cod, and Danish klipfish is
so good that large quantities of it are exported to
Spain, where "bacalao", as it is called there, is much
appreciated.

Cut 2 lbs. of fish in pieces and soak for 24 hours in
lukewarm water (or milk, if desired) with a teaspoon
of soda.  Take up the fish, cut off the fins, and
scrape the skin.  Put over the fire in cold water
without salt and cook for half an hour until quite
tender.

Serve on a hot platter garnished with parsley and with
boiled potatoes, melted butter, mustard sauce and a
dish of diced, hard boiled eggs (figure one egg per
person).

From "Danish Cookery" by Suzanne, Andr. Fred. Host &
Son, Copenhagen, 1957.
