Title: KHICHADI FROM MAJA
Categories: Indian, Grains, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Basmati rice
3/4 c  Moong dal
8 c  ;Water
1/3 c  Raw cashews
1/2 c  Raw almonds
1/4 c  Coconut
3/4 c  Peas
3/4 c  Carrots
3    Inch piece of cinnamon
8    Whole cloves
1    Whole red chile
2 ts Sugar (Optional)
1/4 ts Asafetida, yellow
1/3 c  Currants - Raisins
1 ts Cumin
1 ts Black mustard seeds
Parsley or cilantro
Garam masala
First rinse the following ingredients separately:
rice, dal, almonds, cashews, coconut and currants.

In a heavy pan, heat the water to boiling.

While waiting for the water to boil, toast the almonds
and cashews in a dab of ghee. Just before nuts are
toasted, add the coconut and toast all until brown.
Remove nut mixture from pan; set aside.

Next toast the cumin and black mustard seeds in a dab
of ghee. Cover pot while toasting, due to mustard
seeds popping while cooking.  Cook spices for 1 to 2
minutes.  Remove from pan; set aside.

When water boils, add the dal and cook for about 2
minutes. The dal will foam up in the cooking process,
so remove the foam after two minutes. Then add the
rice and all of the spices. Boil, covered, for about 1
more minute.

Turn the fire off under the rice mixture and let sit.

Toast the carrots and peas in a dab of ghee while the
rice is sitting. The rice will be ready to have the
remaining ingredients added after the veggies are
cooked.  (I like to leave the carrots somewhat al
dente.)

Open the pot and sprinkle garam masala over the rice
and then add the cleaned raisins, veggies, and half of
the nut mixture, in that order.

Sprinkle again with garam masala. Cover and let sit
for a short time.

Transfer the rice to a large bowl and stir the dish
until all ingredients are completely blended. Sprinkle
some more garam masala for looks and add the remaining
nuts for a garnish.

Buddhist in Louisville, KY. Had Summer 1993.  Very
tasty stuff!  Posted by Cathy Harned.
