.paprika
Make a roux with flour and shortening, paprika and
caraway seed. When done, add water to fill pot (1
quart), and bring to boil. Careful now...don't let it
get lumpy.  Let boil for 3-4 minutes till flour taste
is gone. If you don't care for the idea of eating the
caraway seeds, you can quickly pour soup through
sieve. It's all ready to serve...however, a variation
is to scramble an egg into it for the "egg drop"
effect. Caraway Soup - Komenymagos Leves
