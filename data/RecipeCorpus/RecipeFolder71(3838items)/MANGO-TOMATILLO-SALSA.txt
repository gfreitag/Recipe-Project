:

Roast the Ancho Chilies and the garlic in an oven. Remove the chilies
when they are puffed out, and the garlic when it is soft and warm.

Dice the mangoes, tomatillos, tomatoes, and onion and mix them in a
large bowl.  Add a small amount of vinegar (about 1 tablespoon) and
the juice of the two limes.

Puree or smash the cloves of roasted garlic and add them to the
mixture.

Crumble the Chilies into the mixture.  If you like it hotter, leave
the seeds in; if not, take them out.

Wash and add the cilantro and any extra chili powder to taste.

Mix the salsa until it's well-combined.  Put it in the refrigerator
and let it sit a few hours before serving.
