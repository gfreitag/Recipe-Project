Title: MAIDA PAROTTAS
Categories: Bread
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Maida (plain flour)
1 ts Baking powder
Salt and water as needed
4 tb Ghee or oil
Sieve the maida with the baking powder. Add a tablespoon of ghee and
rub well till mixed. Add salt and enough water (about 3/4 cup) and
knead well to make a soft dough. Divide into eight equal sized balls.
Roll out each into thin chappathies and smear some ghee all over.
Sponge roll each from one end to the other (similar to rolling a
poster into a tube shape). Roll it out again into a flat round shape.
Set aside for 30 minutes. Lightly roll it up again into thick
chappathies. Heat the griddle stone over a low fire, put the parotta
on it. Turn it and smear it with some ghee and fry both sides till
golden brown.
