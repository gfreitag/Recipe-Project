Title: KOTLETY TSIPLENOKOVO PO-KIEVSKI (CHICKEN KIEV
Categories: Chicken, Ukrainian
Yield: 4 Servings
4 lg Chicken breasts
200 g  Butter
1    Egg yolk
2    Egg; beaten
1/2 c  Flour
Breadcrumbs, dry
Butter; for frying
Wash and dry breasts, removing any connective tissue
or skin. Place smooth side on cutting board, and pound
to flatten to about five millimeters thickness.

Combine butter with yolk of egg and divide into four
equal parts. Roll into sausage shapes seven to eight
centimeters long.  Cover each with greasproof paper
and chill until the pieces are very hard.

Wrap the breasts around each piece of butter, creating
four parcels. Dip in flour, one at a time.  Shake off
excess flour and pat flat in the palm of the hand.
Dip in beaten eggs and roll in breadcrumbs.
Refrigerate for a few hours.  Deep-fry (in butter if
possible) until golden brown.

NOTE:  Traditionally, Chicken Kiev is served with
buckwheat kasha and peas served in small pastry
shells.  DO NOT REHEAT this dish or keep warm for
periods of time, as the butter will melt and run out.
