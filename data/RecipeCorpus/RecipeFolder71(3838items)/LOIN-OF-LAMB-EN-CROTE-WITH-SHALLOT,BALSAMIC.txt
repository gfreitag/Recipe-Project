For Roasted Shallot Balsamic Vinegar Sauce:  In a medium saucepan
place the beef stock and balsamic vinegar. Heat them on medium high
for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced to 1/4. While
stirring constantly, add the butter pieces one at a time, and whisk
them in so that they are well incorporated. Add the roasted shallots,
salt and pepper. Set aside while you prepare the lamb. Rub the lamb
loins with the 1 tablespoon of olive oil and garlic clove. Sprinkle
them with the salt and the pepper. In a heavy skillet place the 2
tablespoons of olive oil and heat it on medium until it is hot.  Sear
the lamb on both sides. Cut the puff pastry sheet so that it is the
length of the lamb loin and 2-1/2 times as wide. Place the lamb in
the center of the sheet. Top the lamb with the roasted peppers, feta
cheese, and cooked spinach. Fold one end of the dough over the lamb.
Brush the other side of the pastry with the egg wash and then fold it
over on top of the other pastry end by 2". Cut off the extra dough
and reserve it.  Crimp the open ends together with your fingers. Turn
the wrapped lamb over.  Make a braid the length of the lamb with the
left-over pastry dough. Brush the top of the dough with the egg wash
and place the braid on top. Preheat the oven to 425øF.  Bake the
wrapped lamb for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the dough is golden
brown. Serve the baked lamb with the Roasted Shallot Balsamic Vinegar
Sauce.
