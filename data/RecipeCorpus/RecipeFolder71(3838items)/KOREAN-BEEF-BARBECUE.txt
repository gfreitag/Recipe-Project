Title: KOREAN BEEF BARBECUE
Categories: Main dish, Meats, Beverages
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Boneless Beef: Cut 1 1/2"
Thick
1 tb Sesame Seeds
1 c  Scallions; Chopped, 2 Lg
2 lg Cloves Garlic; Minced
1/4 c  Soy Sauce
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Dry Sherry
2 tb Vegetable Oil
Freeze the meat until firm, about 2 hours.  Meanwhile,
in a heavy iron skillet, spread the sesame seeds and
toast over moderate heat until golden. Stir the seed
once or twice to toast evenly.  With a mortar and
pestle or with the back of a spoon against a board,
grind the seeds until powdery. Place in a large bowl
with the scallions, garlic to taste (if you like
garlic, up to 3 cloves may be used), soy sauce, sugar,
sherry, and vegetable oil, blending well.  With a very
sharp knife, cut the semi-frozen meat (beef chuck,
round or sirloin), across the grain, into strips about
1/4-inch thick.  Add the meat strips to the sauce,
stirring to coat well, cover, and marinate at room
temperature for 1 to 2 hours. Let the fire in a
hibachi or small grill burn down ot glowing coals. If
the grill rack is widely spaced, place the meat strips
in a hinged wire broiler. Broil about 1 minute on each
side until browned but still rare. Serve with rice and
vinegary coleslaw or cucumber salad.
