Directions: Combine first 4 ingredients in a large zip-top heavy-duty
plastic bag. Add chicken; seal bag, and marinate in refrigerator 8
hours, turning bag occasionally.

Remove chicken from bag, reserving marinade. Coat the grill rack with
cooking spray; place on grill over medium-hot coals. Place chicken on
rack, and cook 10 minutes on each side or until chicken is done,
basting occasionally with reserved marinade. Set aside, and keep warm.

Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan; add bell pepper and onion.
Cook 30 seconds; drain. Plunge into ice water; drain well. Set aside.

Position knife blade in food processor bowl; add beans and next 5
ingredients. Process until smooth. Pour into a saucepan, and cook over
medium heat until heated.

Spoon 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon bean mixture onto each of 4 serving
plates. Place 1 chicken breast half on top of sauce; top each with 2
tablespoons bell pepper mixture. Garnish with fresh cilantro, if
desired.

Note: The exotic flavors of South Florida and the Caribbean combine
in this attractive yet easy entree. Serve it with yellow rice, a
tossed green salad, and crusty bread to use for sopping up every
single drop of the delicious savory sauce.
