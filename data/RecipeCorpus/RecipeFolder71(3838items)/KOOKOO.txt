A delightful name for a delightful dish. Kookoo makes
a substantial and satisfying meal in its own right,
served with just a side-salad.

Grease a large, heavy frying-pan with 2 tsp of the oil
and arrange the sliced potatoes over the surface.
Season with a little salt and pepper and dribble the
rest of the oil over them. Cover with a lid and cook
over a very gentle heat for 10 minutes.

Mix the mushrooms, spring onions and parsley into the
beaten eggs and season to taste. Pour over the
potatoes in the pan, cover again and cook over a low
heat for a further 10 minutes.

Slide the kookoo out of the pan on to a platter and
serve it cut in wedges. Hand around grated cheese to
sprinkle over the top.
