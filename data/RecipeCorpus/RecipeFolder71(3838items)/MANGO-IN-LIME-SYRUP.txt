Categories: Fruits, Sauces, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Ripe mangoes, or 4 if they
.are small ones
Rind and juice of 2 limes
100 g  Granulated sugar
2 tb Water
4    (to 8) fresh mint leaves
Peel the mangoes with a very sharp knife.  Cut them lengthwise as
close as possible to the stone, to obtain two caps. Slice these
across the other way and, taking care to keep the slices together,
arrange on a lipped plate. Put lime juice in pan with sugar. Add
water and heat for a few minutes until reduced to a syrup. Towards
the end of this process add the lime rind, mix and allow to cool.
Pour cooled syrup over the mangoes and decorate with mint sprigs.
You can pour a shot of vodka over the finished dish. From: Kerry Camm
