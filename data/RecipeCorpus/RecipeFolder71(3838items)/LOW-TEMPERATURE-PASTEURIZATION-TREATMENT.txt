Title: LOW-TEMPERATURE PASTEURIZATION TREATMENT
Categories: Canning, Preserves, Pickles
Yield: 1 Text  The following treatment results in a better product texture but must
be carefully managed to avoid possible spoilage. Place jars in a
canner filled half way with warm (120 degree to 140 degree F) water.
Then, add hot water to a level 1 inch above jars. Heat the water
enough to maintain 180 degree to 185 degree F water temperature for
30 minutes. Check with a candy or jelly thermometer to be certain
that the water temperature is at least 180 degrees F during the
entire 30 minutes. Temperatures higher than 185 degrees F may cause
unnecessary softening of pickles. Caution: Use only when recipe
indicates.
