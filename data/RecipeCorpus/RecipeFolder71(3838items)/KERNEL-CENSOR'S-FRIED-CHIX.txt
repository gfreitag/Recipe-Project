Title: KERNEL CENSOR'S FRIED CHIX
Categories: Chicken, Cookies, Dressings
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Whole milk
1 c  Club soda
3 lb Chicken fryer parts
1 c  Aunt Jemima Pancake Mix
2 pk Good Seasons Italian Mild --
Salad dressing mix
3 tb All-purpose unbleached
Flour
2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Lemon juice
2 ts Vegetable cooking oil
Wash chicken pieces, pat dry, and allow to air dry in
refrigerator for 1 or more hours. Combine the last 5
ingredients to make a paste. Spread the paste over the
chicken. Stack pieces in a bowl, cover, and let stand
in refrigerator overnight. About one hour before
serving, heat about 1-1/2 pints of cooking oil in a
heavy saucepan or deep-fry pot to 425F. Oil should be
about 3 inches deep. While oil is heating, put milk
and club soda in a deep narrow bowl and dip each piece
of chicken in the liquid; letting the excess liquid
drip off. Dust pieces lightly, but evenly with Aunt
Jemima Pancake Mix. Do not overcoat. Air dry the
pieces for a few minutes without letting the pieces
touch each other. Deepfry a few pieces at a time in
the hot oil, and place on a cookie sheet; bake
uncovered for 30 minutes in the oven at 350F.
