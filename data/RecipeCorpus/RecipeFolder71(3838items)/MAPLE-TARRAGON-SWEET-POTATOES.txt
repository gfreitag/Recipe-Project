Categories: Side dish, Thanxgiving, Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
4 lb Sweet potatoes, peeled &
-- sliced
1/3 c  Maple syrup
1/4 c  Oil
1/4 c  Orange juice
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Tarragon
Preheat oven to 350F.  Lightly oil a shallow casserole dish. Arrange
sweet potato slices on overlapping rows in the dish.

In a small bowl, combine the maple syrup, oil, orange juice, cinnamon
and salt.  Pour this evenly over the potatoes. Sprinkle the top with
tarragon.

Cover & bake until easily pierced with a fork, but the potatoes ought
to be still firm.  This should take about 30 minutes. Uncover & bake
until glazed and golden around the edges, about another 25 minutes.
