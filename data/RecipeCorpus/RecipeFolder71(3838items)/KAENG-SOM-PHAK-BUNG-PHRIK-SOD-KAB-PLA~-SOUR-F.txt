cabbage, kale, or even broccoli can be substituted

method

combine the ingredients for the chili paste to a fine
even consistency.

Wash and dice the fish.

Place the fish in a bowl, add the lime juice, fish
sauce, tamarind juice, Tabasco and chili paste, and
leave to marinade for at least an hour.

Bring two cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan
or wok, and add the liquid from the marinading fish,
then add the vegetables and boil for about two
minutes. Adjust the flavour to taste (it should be a
little salty and a little sour, and as hot as you
desire it at this stage).

Add the tomato and bring back to the boil

Add the remaining ingredients, return to the boil, and
stir occasionally until the fish is cooked.
