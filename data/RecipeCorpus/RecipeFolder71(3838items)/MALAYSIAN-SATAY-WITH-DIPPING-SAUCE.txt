Here's one for all the Satay freaks out there.  From an article on
Asian snacks by Bruce Cost in the San Francisco Chronicle, 7/20/88.

Thread the squid rings and tentacles (through the fleshy part) on
bamboo skewers, leaving about 3 inches for a handle. Wrap the handle
in aluminum foil (or soak skewers for 1 hour in water before using.)

Combine cumin, coriander and hot peppers.  Toast in a dry skillet
until fragrant; grind go a powder.  Mix well with fish sauce, lime
juice and brown sugar.  Add squid, marinate on a tray for 30 minutes,
turning from time to time.  Meanwhile, get a hot fire going on a
grill, and make a dip sauce by combining remaining ingredients. Grill
squid for about 90 seconds on each side. Serve with dipping sauce on
the side.
