COCOA POWDER Make the chocolate cookie wafers: Position a rack in the
lower third of the oven and preheat to 275 F. Generously butter two
large baking sheets. Cut a 3 1/2 inch circle out from a plastic
coffee can or similar lid. Discard the center. The outer rim of the
lid will be used as a stencil for the wafers. Into a large stainless
steel bowl, sift together the flour, the cocoa, and the black pepper.
In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with the
wire whip attachment, on medium speed, beat the confectioners' sugar
and the egg whites until well combined. Continue beating on
medium-high speed until glossy and stiff peaks form, about 5 to 6
minutes. With a large rubber spatula, fold 1/3 of the flour mixture
into the stiff egg white/sugar mixture. Fold in the vanilla and half
of the melted butter. Fold in another third of the flour mixture.
Fold in the rest of the melted butter and the flour mixture. Place
the prepared wafer stencil on the baking sheet. Fill the stencil with
a very thin layer of the wafer batter, smoothing it evenly with a
small metal spatula. Repeat this process with the remaining batter.
Bake the wafers for 12 to 15 minutes, until firm and no longer
sticky. The wafers should still be pliable when they come out of the
oven, but will become crisp as they cool. Carefully remove the
individual wafers to a cooling rack to finish cooling.
