Title: KAHLUA BAKED BEANS
Categories: Beans
1 lb dried navy beans, picked
over -- rinsed
Yield: 10 Servings
:
1/2 lb bacon slices, cut in pieces
with scissors
:
2 c  onion -- finely chopped
1    12-oz bottle  chili sauce
1/2 c  tomato-based barbeque sauce,
preferably
smoked
:
:
1/2 c  Kahlua
1/2 c  strong brewed coffee
1/4 c  dijon mustard
1/4 c  unsulfered molasses
2 TB thick, spicy steak sauce,
such as Heinz 57
:
2 TB Tabasco sauce
1 ts salt

1.  Soak the beans in lots of water to cover
overnight.  Drain. 2. In a large pot, cover beans
generously with fresh cold water.  Set the pot over
medium heat and bring the water to a boil, then lower
the heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring once or
twice, for 1 hour or more, until the beans are very
soft but still holding their shape.  (The beans should
not be salted at the initial cooking stage, as salt
will toughen the beans.) Drain, reserving 1 1/2 cups
of the bean cooking liquid. 3. Cook the bacon in a
large skillet until crispy.  Remove the bacon from the
pan and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat.  Add
the onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
4. Combine the beans with 1 1/2 cups cooking liquid,
bacon, onions, chili sauce, barbeque sauce, Kahlua,
coffee, mustard, molasses, steak sauce, Tabasco and
salt. Transfer to a heavy 5 quart nonreactive
casserole or Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid. Bake
in a preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. 5.
Remove the lid, stir the beans and continue baking,
uncovered, 30 minutes. Stir and continue baking 40
minutes, until beans are very thick. Stir
occasionally. (The beans can be cooled, covered and
refrigerated; reheat the next day on a medium-low
burner.)
