Into a large kettle of vigorously boiling salted water, plunge the
lobsters, head first, and boil them, covered, for 8 minutes from the
time the water returns to a boil. Transfer lobsters to a cutting
board and allow them to cool.  Break off claws at the body, and crack
them. Remove claw meat and cut it into 1/2-inch pieces. Halve the
lobsters lengthwise along the undersides and remove meat from the
tails. Cut into 1/2-inch pieces. In a heavy saucepan, cook the
lobster meat in the butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally,
for 2 minutes. Add 6 teas. Sherry and 3 Tbsp brandy, and cook the
mixture, stirring for 2 minutes. Transfer lobster meat to a bowl. Add
the cream to the Sherry mixture and boil until it is reduced to about
1 cup. Reduce heat to low and stir in the remaining Sherry and
brandy, nutmeg, cayenne, and salt to taste. Whisk in the yolks. Cook
the mixture, whisking constantly, until it registers 140f on a cooking
thermometer.  Cook, whisking, for 3 more minutes. Stir in lobster
meat and serve over the toast points. A 1965 Gourmet Mag. favorite
