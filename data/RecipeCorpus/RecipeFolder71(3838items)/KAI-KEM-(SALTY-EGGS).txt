This Chinese invention is loved by Thais, who serve
salty eggs as a contrast to the incendiary heat of a
green curry or a bland dish.  Kai kem is traditionally
made with duck's eggs, which are cured for several
weeks in a simple salt brine.  Once cured, they keep
for many months at room temperature, and are boiled
when it's time to eat them.

In a medium saucepan, combine the water and salt and
stir well with a large spoon to dissolve some of the
salt.  Place over medium heat and bring to a boil,
stirring frequently.  After mixture boils rigorously
for about 1 minute, remove from the heat, stir once
more, and cool to room temperature.

Gently arrange the eggs in a crock or large jar.  Pour
the cooled brine over the eggs, making sure they are
completely submerged. Cover and keep in a cool place
for 1 month.

When you're ready to use the eggs, place the number of
eggs you want in a small pan and add cold water to
cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When the
water reaches a rolling boil, reduce the heat to low
and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool
to room temperature. Peel and serve.

Note:  Salty or Salted Eggs are sold uncooked in Asian
markets.  Often they are covered with 1/4-inch layer
of charcoal colored ash. Rinse off the ash and cook as
above.
