Title: LEMON CAPER MAYONNAISE
Categories: Condiments, Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
1 tb Lemon peel; minced
1 1/2 ts Capers; chopped, drained
Mix all ingredients together in small bowl.  (Can be prepared 5
days ahead.  Chill.)
Note from me:  I would suggest adding a drop of Tabasco to this
mixture.  Some white pepper wouldn't hurt if it still needs flavor.
