6    Green onions

Recipe by: Anna Baird <BAIRD@WRLCVM.BITNET> Mix it all
together and marinate at least 2 hours.   Can either
cook it on the grill as kebabs or stir-fry by itself.
Enjoy.

When I don't have sirloin tips, I use flank steak and
it tastes just as goo Also, I substitute hot pepper
sesame oil and also add cayenne pepper for more kick.
The sugar allows the beef to caramelize a little (I
tried using cane sugar once but it didn't caramelize).

NOTES: Just tried this recipe recently (4 or 5 times)
and it is absolutely wonderful - from Omaha Steaks
