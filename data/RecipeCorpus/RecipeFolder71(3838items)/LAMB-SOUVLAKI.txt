1    Leg of lamb; boned, cubed*
5    Baby lamb sweetbreads, opt.*
4    Baby lamb kidneys,  opt. *
1/4 c  Olive oil
Lemon's juice
1/4 c  Wine
1/4 ts Thyme
1/4 ts Oregano
1/4 ts Rosemary
1    Bay leaf; crushed
2    Garlic cloves; crushed
Freshly ground black pepper
8    Bay leaves; cut
Firm tomatoes (opt); 1/4'd
Green peppers (opt); cubed
Salt
Oregano and lemon quarters
*Note: Lamb meat(s) should be cut into cubes the size of walnuts.
Place the lamb, sweetbreads, and kidney cubes in a large non-aluminum
bowl. Make a marinade of the oil, lemon juice, wine, herbs, garlic,
and pepper and pour over the meat.  Marinate in the refrigerator,
preferably overnight, or for at least 3 hours.  Thread the meat on
long skewers alternating the bay leaves with the tomatoes and
peppers, if desired. Grill over hot coals or broil 6 inches from the
heat, brushing with the remaining marinade and turning frequently.
Season with salt and pepper, then remove the meat from the skewers to
a warm platter and crush oregano over the top. Garnish with lemon
quarters and serve hot. From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma Liacouras
