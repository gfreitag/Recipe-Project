Categories: Soups, Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Leeks
1 1/2 lb Potatoes
2 tb Butter
6 c  Water
8 oz Cheese, shredded
1/4 c  Oil
1 tb Butter
3 c  Bread cubes
1 c  Cream, heavy
1/8 ts Nutmeg, ground
1 pt Oysters, with liquor
1/4 c  Parsley, chopped
Gruyere or Swiss are preferred.  Trim off root ends and most of green
part of leeks. Reserve white part plus a small part of green. Split
in half and rinse thoroughly between leaves. Cut leeks lengthwise
into thin strips and then crosswise into very small cubes. There
should be about 5 cups. Peel potatoes and cut them lengthwise in
half. Cut each half crosswise into very thin slices. There should be
about 4 cups. Heat butter in a large saucepan and add chopped leek.
Cook, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes and water and
bring to boil. Salt and pepper to taste. Simmer 20 minutes. Drain in
colander, reserving liquid and solids. Heat oil and butter in heavy
skillet and add bread cubes. Cook, stirring, until cubes are golden
brown. Drain in sieve.  Process leek and potato solids thoroughly
while adding small amounts of reserved cooking liquid. Add only
enough liquid to make a fine puree. Combine puree with remaining
liquid in saucepan and bring to simmer. Add cream and salt and pepper
to taste. Add nutmeg and heat thoroughly. Add oysters with their
liquor and cook briefly, just until oysters curl.  Serve sprinkled
with parsley, with croutons and cheese on the side.
