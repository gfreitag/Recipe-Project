Categories: Digest, Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
4 c  Vegetable broth
1 lb Carrots, diced
1 bn Of broccoli flowerets
1/2    Head cauliflower flowerets
1 lb Potatoes, cut into bite
-sized pieces
1    Onion, diced
1 ts Or more of your favorite
-seasoning
1/2 ts Ground curry
1/8 ts Ground pepper
1 cn Skimmed evaporated milk
-chopped parsley
-(optional)
-seasoned croutons
-(optional)
Over low heat in a soup pot, cook half of the carrots, half of the
broccoli, potatoes, and onion in the broth for about an hour. Add
milk and stir thoroughly. Puree half of the mixture in a blender
until smooth, making sure you include a good amount of potatoes.
Return to the pot. Add the seasonings and remainder of the carrots
and broccoli and cook about 10 minutes longer. If you want it even
thicker, add more potatoes, which you can also blend separately and
add in.  Serve hot, topped with parsley and seasoned croutons.  If
desired, add additional uncooked broccoli and carrots to the bowl
just before serving or heating up.

Note: for my vegan daughter, I blended before adding the milk and put
hers aside.  It was green soup!
