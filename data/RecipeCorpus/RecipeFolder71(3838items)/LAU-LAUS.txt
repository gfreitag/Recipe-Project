Recipe by: arielle@bonkers.taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva) Wash the
taro leaves thoroughly.  Remove stem and fibrous part of veins by
pulling gently with the tip of a knife from the stem out to the edge
of the leaves. Place pork in bowl.  Add salt.  Work together. Arrange
5 leaves, the largest on the bottom.  Place pork with fat side up.
Place fish on top of pork. Fold leaves over pork and fish to form a
bundle (puolo). Prepare each ti leaf by cutting partially through the
stiff rib and stripping it off. Place lau lau on the end of a ti leaf
and wrap tightly. Wrap another ti leaf around in the opposite
direction, thereby forming a flat package. Tie with string, or
fibrous part of ti leaves. Place in a steamer. As soon as water is
boiling, turn heat to low.  Steam lau laus 5 to 6 hours. Remove
string before serving.
