Title: LEMON MERINGUE COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
3    Egg whites, at room
-temperature
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
6 tb Granulated sugar
1 tb Grated lemon zest
With electric mixer, beat whites until foamy. Add cream of tartar,
and beat on high speed until soft peaks form. Beat in sugar, 1
tablespoon at a time; continue beating until stiff and shiny peaks
form. Gently fold in lemon zest. Drop mixture by heaping tablespoons
onto 2 buttered and floured baking sheets. Bake in preheated 250
degree oven 1 hour. Turn off oven; do not open oven door. Leave
cookies undisturbed, in oven for 1 hour. Then transfer to wire racks
to cool completely. Store in a tightly covered container.

Note: Recipe can be doubled or tripled if you save egg whites in the
freezer, like I do; just defrost and bring to room temperature before
using. Like most meringue recipes, you need a low humidity day and
utensils that are free from any fat residue, to be successful. Any
citrus zest will work fine to vary the flavor. by Lori Longbotham,
