1 lb Lean ground lamb
1 md Onion, finely chopped
2 tb Chopped fresh mint
1 ts Ground cayenne pepper
1 ts Ground cloves
1 ts Ground allspice
1 ts Ground ginger
1 ts Ground cardamom
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg

Keftas, from North Africa, are meatballs prepared with ground lamb or
beef and a number of herbs and spices. They appear in a variety of
dishes, such as stews, and also as brochettes hot off the charcoal
grill. The seasonings range from chili to cinnamon and usually
include a Moroccan favorite, fresh mint. These keftas are delicious
served with pita bread, low-fat yogurt, tomatoes and lettuce or with
cooked rice. Note: If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 20
minutes.

Combine all ingredients, cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 24
hours. Shape into 30 1 1/2-inch meatballs and thread them on six
skewers. (You may slightly flatten them to make sausage shapes or
leave them as balls.)

Prepare a gas grill or charcoal fire. Grill for 3 minutes on each
side, or just until no longer pink inside. Alternatively, broil the
meatballs for 2 minutes on each side.
