Title: LAST WORD IN NUTMEG MUFFINS
Categories: Muffins
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  Flour
3/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Baking powder
1 1/2    Nutmegs, whole; grated
1/2 ts Salt
1    Egg
3/4 c  Heavy cream
3/4 c  Milk
5 tb Butter, melted
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease the muffin tins.
Stir together with a fork the flour, sugar, baking powder, nutmeg,
and salt in a medium-size bowl, thoroughly combining the
ingredients. Beat the egg well in a small bowl, then stir in the
cream, milk, and butter and blend well. Add the cream mixture to the
flour mixture and stir only until there are no streaks of flour.
Don't overmix.
Spoon batter two-thirds full in each muffin cup. Bake for about 20
minutes, or until rounded tops are lightly golden. Remove muffins
from the pan and serve warm. Or cool on a rack and store or freeze
for later use; warm before serving.
