Title: LOW CARBOHYDRATE WAFFLES
Categories: Breads, Breakfast, Low carb
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Protein drink mix
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
2 ts Cream of tartar
1 lg Egg, separated
1/2 c  Heavy Cream
1/4 c  Water
2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
Heat waffle iron. Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.
Whisk yolk with cream, water and butter. Beat egg white until it just
holds a 2-inch peak. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients in a
thin steady stream while gently mixing with a rubber spatula; be
careful not to add liquid faster than you can incorporate it. Toward
end of mixing, use a folding motion to incorporate ingredients;
gently fold egg white into batter. Spread appropriate amount of
batter onto waffle iron. Following manufacturer's instructions, cook
waffle until golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately. (You
can keep waffles warm on a wire rack in a 200-degree oven for up to 5
minutes.) Makes 3 to 4 waffles. NOTES : "If you're out of buttermilk,
try this sweet-milk variation. By making your own baking powder using
baking soda and cream of tartar and by cutting back on the quantity
of milk, you can make a thick, quite respectable batter. The result
is a waffle with a crisp crust and a moist interior." -- Christopher
