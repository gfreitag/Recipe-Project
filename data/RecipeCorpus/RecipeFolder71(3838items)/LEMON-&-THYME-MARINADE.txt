Title: LEMON & THYME MARINADE
Categories: Poultry, French, Marinades
Yield: 14 Servings
2 tb Strained fresh lemon juice
2 ts Chopped fresh thyme, OR 3/4
-tsp dried, crumbled
2 tb Olive oil OR vegetable oil
This is a tangy marinade, containing equal amounts of lemon juice and
oil, and is good for rich meats like chicken thighs. It can be used
for chicken breasts too, but their skin should be on for additional
protection during grilling or broiling.  Thyme gives this marinade a
flavor loved in France, but you can substitute oregano for an Italian
or Greek accent, or mint or cilantro for a Lebanese touch.

Mix ingredients in a small bowl.

Makes about 1/4 cup, enough for about 1 1/2 to 2 lbs poultry.
