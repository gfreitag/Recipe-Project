-JEANNETTE NUTTER (SFBT34B)
1 1/8 c  Water
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
2 c  Bread flour
1/2 c  Quick oats
3/4 c  7 grain cereal
2 tb Powdered buttermilk
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Honey
2 tb Margarine
2 pk Yeast

I just dump it all in the pan. Set for light crust and white bread
cycle. It turns out great every time. I don't know if it's got the
right combinations or amounts but it tastes great and to us that's
all that counts.  ROM: JEANNETTE NUTTER (SFBT34B) Reformatted by
