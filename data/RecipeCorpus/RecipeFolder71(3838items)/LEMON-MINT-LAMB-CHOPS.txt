Title: LEMON MINT LAMB CHOPS
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
8    Loin lamb chops
3 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Olive oil
1 tb Chopped fresh mint (or 1/2
-tsp dried)
LEMON MINT BUTTER:
1/2 c  Unsalted butter, at room
-temperature
2 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Chopped fresh mint (or 1/2
-tsp. dried)
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper to taste
Trim excess fat off the lamb chops.  Combine the lemon juice, salt,
olive oil, mint and pepper.  Marinate the lamb in this mixture in a
flat dish, turning often, for at least 30 minutes at room temperature
or longer in the refrigerator.

While lamb is marinating, prepare the compound butter. Cream the
butter with the lemon juice, mint and salt and pepper to taste. Place
the butter on a piece of waxed paper and shape into a cylinder about
3 x 1 1/2 inches. Refrigerate.

Broil, barbecue or pan fry the lamb chops approximately 3 to 5
minutes on each side (they should be slightly rare). Slice the butter
thinly and place two slices on each hot chop.  The butter will melt
slowly and moisten and flavour the lamb.  Lower-fat Version: Use only
a very thin slice of the lemon butter, or omit it entirely. Yield: 4
