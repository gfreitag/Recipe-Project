Categories: Cyberealm, Kooknet, Cakes, Desserts
* Streusel Filling: 1/3 c Packed brown sugar
Yield: 8 Servings
1/3 c Chopped pecans 1/4 t  Cinnamon 1/4 t Mace (this
spice makes
- the cake!)
* Cake:
2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1 t  Baking powder 3/4 t Baking soda 3/4 t Salt 1/2
t Mace 1/2 c Butter or margarine,
- softened 1 1/4 c Granulated sugar
2    Eggs
1 t  Vanilla 3/4 c Sour cream 3/4 c Kahlua
* Kahlua Glaze: 3/4 c Sifted powdered sugar
2 T  Softened butter
1 T  Kahlua

1)  Grease and flour 9 in. fluted tube pan. Preheat
oven to 350Ã¸F.

2)  Prepare Streusel Filling: Mix ingredients and set
aside.

3)  Prepare Cake batter: Re-sift flour with baking
powder, soda, salt and mace.  (I never do any sifting,
but this is what the recipe calls for) In large bowl,
combine butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Beat 2 min.
on medium speed (batter may appear curdled). On lowest
speed, blend in flour alternately with sour cream and
Kahlua.

4)  Turn 1/3 batter into prepared pan.  Cover with 1/2
Streusel Filling, an additional 1/3 batter and
remaining Streusel. Top with remaining batter.

5)  Bake on rack below oven center for 45 min., or
until golden brown. Remove and let stand 10 min.
Invert on cake rack; cool till lukewarm (with pan on
top).

6)  While cake is cooling, prepare Kahlua Glaze:
Combine ingredients and beat until smooth.

7)  Remove pan and spoon glaze over top of lukewarm
cake.  Top with pecan halves if desired.  Serves 8-10.

8)  Enjoy!
