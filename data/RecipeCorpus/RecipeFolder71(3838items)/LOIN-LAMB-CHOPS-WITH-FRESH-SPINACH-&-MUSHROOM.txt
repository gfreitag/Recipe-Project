8    Boneless loin lamb chops;
-cut 1-inch thick (about
-2 lbs total), trimmed of
-excess fat and tied
1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Fresh rosemary; minced
1 lb Mushrooms; sliced 1/4-inch
-thick
1 lb Fresh spinach; stemmed and
-rinsed
1/2 c  Dry red wine
3 tb Unsalted butter
Preheat the broiler.  Rub the chops all over with 2 tablespoons of the
olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the rosemary.
Set the chops aside.

In a large heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over high
heat.  Add the mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1/4
teaspoon rosemary. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they are golden
brown, about 5 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat and set
aside.

Broil the lamb chops about 5 inches from the heat for 3 to 4 minutes
on each side, or until golden brown on the outside and rosy pink in
the center.  Remove the string from each chop. Reheat the mushrooms
briefly over moderate heat and arrange neatly down the center of a
warmed serving platter.  Put the chops on top of the mushrooms.

In the large nonreactive skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon
olive oil over moderately high heat.  Add the spinach and the
remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until wilted
and tender but still bright green, about 4 minutes.  Spoon the
spinach around the chops. Cover to keep warm.

Add the wine to the pan and cook over high heat until it is reduced
to 1/4 cup, about 4 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the
butter. Pour over the chops and serve.
