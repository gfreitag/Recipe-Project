In a non-reactive bowl, combine the Ahi, cucumber, tomato, onion, lime
juice, oils and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate and
allow to marinate 30 minutes. Remove 20 minutes before serving and
stir in cilantro. Serve on baked wontons garnished with green onions,
sesame seeds and Tobiko, if desired. Yield: 8-10 servings as an
appetizer

This is based on an appetizer mixture served universally throughout
Hawaii. Add/substitute whatever other fresh, seasonal crunchy
vegetable you can find such as jicama, fresh water chestnuts,
parsnips, etc.

BAKED WONTONS:

This is more a technique than a hard and fast recipe. Beat 4 egg
whites with a tablespoon of water until frothy. With a pastry brush,
lightly paint wonton skins with the mixture and arrange in a single
layer on non-stick or parchment lined baking sheets and bake in a
preheated 375 degree oven for 5-8 minutes or until wontons are
lightly browned and crisp. You can sprinkle the brushed but unbaked
wontons with sesame seed, Kosher salt, poppy seed or whatever to add
interest. Store in airtight container for up to 3 days.
