MMMMM-----------------------CHEESE FILLING----------------------------
1 lb Cream cheese
- room temperature
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 ts Grated lemon zest
2    Eggs
2    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Cream
FOR THE LINZER DOUGH: Preheat oven to 350F with rack in center. Mix
all the dry ingredients in a bowl. Rub in butter finely by hand.
Whisk lemon zest and vanilla with egg and yolk and stir into dough
with a fork--the dough will be very soft. Butter a 12-inch tart pan
with removable bottom. Spread dough evenly in the pan, spreading it
thicker at the edge to form the side wall of the tart shell. For
raspberry version, bake about 25 minutes, until well risen and firm.
Cool in pan on a rack. RASPBERRY FILLING: Spread the preserves in the
tart shell and arrange the raspberries on the preserves. Edge with
the almonds and dust lightly with the confectioners' sugar. CHEESE
VARIATION: Do not bake shell. Beat cream cheese with a hand mixer set
at medium speed or with a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle.
Beat in sugar and continue beating until smooth, adding remaining
ingredients in order, scraping bowl and beater(s) often. Pour into
unbaked Linzer shell, above. Bake about 30 minutes. Cool and finish
with jam and raspberries, if desired, or leave plain.
