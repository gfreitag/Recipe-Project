Title: MAPLE BUTTERNUT SQUASH - NSVHOL
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 10 Servings
2 md Butternut squash; (less than
-two pounds each)
Water
1/2 c  Maple syrup
6 tb Butter
Chopped Parsley, garnish
Cut each squash lengthwise in half; discard seeds. Then cut each half
crosswise into slices about 1 inch thick; cut off peel. (It occurs to
me that this might be easier to do after the next step.)

In a 5 quart saucepan over high heat, in 1 inch boiling water, heat
squash to boiling. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 15 minutes
stirring occasionally, or until squash is fork-tender. Drain.

In large bowl, with mixer at low speed, beat squash, maple syrup, and
butter until smooth, scraping bowl often with a rubber spatula. Spoon
into a warm bowl; sprinkle with parsley.
