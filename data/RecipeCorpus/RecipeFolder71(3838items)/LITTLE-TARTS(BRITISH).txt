Richard II (1377-1399) Making homemade noodle dough takes some elbow
grease, but taste rewards effort. The "won tons" are stuffed with
spiced pork and currants, and make an unusual highlight for a simple
broth. 1. Sift flour and salt together. 2. Make a small well in the
center of the flour, and pour egg and water into it. 3. Combine all
ingredients, mixing and kneading until a smooth, elastic dough is
formed (about
20    minutes). 4. Allow dough to sit for about 20 minutes. 5.
Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll out halves
one at a time into sheets almost paper thin. Dough will be elastic,
and much de- termination is required tn this process. ~our task will
be eased by allowing a section of the dough leaf to hang over the
table's side as you roll. 6. Cut each sheet of dough into about 10 or
12 rsctangular pieces. **** For the Filling and Broth **** 1.Beat 2
eggs, spices, and salt together. 2.Blend egg mixture, pork, and
currants. 3.Place a teaspoon of stuffing on each piece of dough.
4.Beat the third egg. Run this "paste" along the edges of each piece
of dough. Fold dough over stuffing so edges meet. Seal by pressing
edges together. 5.Bring stock to boil. Add tartlettes and any left-
over stuffing, reducing heat to a gentle boil. 6.Cook about 10 to 12
minutes or until noodle dough reaches consistency you enjoy in
spaghetti.
