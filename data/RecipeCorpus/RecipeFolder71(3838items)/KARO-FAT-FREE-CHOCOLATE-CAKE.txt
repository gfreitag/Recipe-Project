FROM:

As part of the advertisement:

"Now bake deliciously fat-free with Karo Corn Syrup.
You don't have to use butter, oil or shortening
because Karo Corn Syrup acts as a shortening as well
as a sweetener in this luscious Chocolate Cake recipe."

Mazola No-stick cooking spray

Preheat oven to 350~.  Spray 9" square baking pan with
cooking spray.

In large bowl, combine dry ingredients until well
mixed.  In medium bowl, whisk egg whites, water and
corn syrup.  Stir into dry ingredients until smooth.
Pour into prepared pan.  Bake 30 minutes or until cake
springs back when lightly touched.  Cool on wire rack
10    minutes.

Makes 16 servings.  Prep time: 15 minutes.

My observation of the accompanying photograph: the
resultant cake is a short, squat, square thing.  So
don't expect something lofty.
