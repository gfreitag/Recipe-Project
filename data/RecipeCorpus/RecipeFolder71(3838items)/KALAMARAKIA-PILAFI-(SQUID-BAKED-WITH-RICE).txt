Title: KALAMARAKIA PILAFI (SQUID BAKED WITH RICE)
Categories: Greek, Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Medium squid
Salt
1/4 c  Olive oil
3    Garlic cloves; sliced
1/4 c  Dry white wine
2    Tomatoes; peeled & seeded
3 tb Butter
1 c  Raw long-grain white rice
Chopped parsley
1 tb Chopped fresh rosemary
Freshly ground pepper
Wash and clean the squid, separating the outer sacs
from the heads and tentacles, removing and discarding
the translucent cartilage, and small sand bag and ink.
Rub salt on the outer sacs and rinse them inside and
out with cold water. Rinse head and tentacles
thoroughly as well. Slice squid into uniform rings,
between 1/2 and 1 inch wide. Heat the oil in a frying
pan and add the squid and garlic and saute for 5
minutes. Stir in the wine and sliced tomatoes, cover,
and simmer until the squid is almost tender
(approximately 30 minutes). Transfer to a baking dish.
Meanwhile, heat the butter and saute the rice, without
browning, until transparent, stirring constantly. Add
the rice to the squid and sprinkle with 1/4 cup
chopped parsley, the rosemary, and salt and pepper to
taste. Add enough hot water to cook the rice, slightly
more than 2 cups including the tomato sauce. Cover and
bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to 40 minutes,
or until the rice is tender. Sprinkle with additional
chopped parsley and serve hot.
