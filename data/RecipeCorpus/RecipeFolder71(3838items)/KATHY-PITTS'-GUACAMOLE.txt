This next recipe is for the closest thing you will
find to a green salad in classic Mexican cooking.
Although many fresh vegetables are used in both
Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes, they usually are
incorporated in the dish, rather than served
separately.

Guacamole (Wahk-uh-MOLE-ay) is an avocado-based
relish/sauce/salad that may be used as a garnish,
accompaniment or first course (often in this role,
accompanied by crisp-fried tortilla wedges for
dipping).

For a really elegant (and typically Mexican)
presentation, serve the Guacamole in individual
lettuce cups, garnished with a radish rose.

Peel and seed the avocados.  Place one avocado in a
bowl and mash until smooth.  Coarsely chop the second
avocado and stir it in, along with the remaining
ingredients.  Serve immediately if possible.

NOTE:  Some cooks prefer to puree all the avocado.
For my taste, this makes the dish seem uncomfortably
like baby food, but if you prefer it smooth, go for it.

If this sauce is to be held for any length of time at
all, return the avocado pits to the mixture (this
helps prevent discoloration), and cover with plastic
wrap, placed directly on the mixture, pressing down to
eliminate all air.  Avocados discolor to a nasty brown
if left exposed to the air.
