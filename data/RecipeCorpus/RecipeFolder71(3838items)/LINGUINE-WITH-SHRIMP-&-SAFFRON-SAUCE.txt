In a small bowl let the saffron soak in the wine for 5 minutes. In a
kettle of boiling salted water cook the linguine with the tumeric for
8 to 10 minutes, or until it is al dente. While the linguine is
cooking, in a large skillet heat the oil over moderate heat until it
is hot but not smoking and in it cook the shrimp, stirring for one
minute. Add the garlic and salt and pepper to taste, cook the
mixture, stirring, until the shrimp just turn pink, and transfer the
shrimp with tongs to a plate. Add the shallot and the saffron mixture
to the skillet and boil the mixture until almost all the liquid is
evaporated. Add the broth, the cream, and the carrots and boil the
mixture until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the peas, the
scallion greens, the linguine, drained well, the shrimp and any
juices that have accumulated on the plate, and salt and pepper to
taste and simmer the mixture until it is just heated through.
