Title: MANGO MILK SHAKE
Categories: Drinks, Indian, Fruit
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Mango pulp (see note)
6 c  Milk, whole
3 tb Sugar
12    Ice cubes
Put into a blender about half (to one third) of the mango pulp, about
3 cups milk, about 1 1/2 T sugar and 6 ice cubes into the blender.
Blend until smooth. Serve. Repeat quickly, as people will already be
asking for more.

NOTES:

*  A refreshing Indian summer drink -- This is a delicious,
refreshing and easy-to-make drink for hot summer days. Yield: 6 12-oz
drinks.

*  Canned mango pulp is available in Indian and Latin American grocery
stores. The "mango nectar" that is widely available in American
grocery stores does not have nearly enough mangoes per unit volume to
make this drink.  If you are lucky enough to be able to get fresh
mangoes, you can use the flesh of one ripe mango for about 1 cup of
the mango pulp; if you do that, increase the amount of sugar to about
2 tablespoon per batch, as canned mango pulp always has added sugar.

*  You can make interesting variations on this recipe by using plain
yogurt for some or all of the milk, and by adding a tart
counterbalance to the mangoes, such as shredded kiwi fruit.
