and spread with fingers. Let stand 15 minutes, turning occasionally
so that entire surface of chicken gets coated. Broil on rack 4 inches

broiling, prepare the sauce: Stir cornstarch into lemon juice;
combine with water and vinegar in a saucepan. Add pineapple, carrot,
green pepper and lemon rind. Bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer
until thickened. When chicken is broiled, place on two individual
serving plates. Pour Lemon-pineapple sauce over chicken. Serve
immediately with a border of shredded lettuce. From Weight Watchers
