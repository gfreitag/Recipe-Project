Title: MAKING JELLY WITHOUT ADDED PECTIN
Categories: Canning, Jellies
Yield: 1 Recipe  Use only firm fruits naturally high in pectin. Selct a mixture of
about 3/4 ripe and 1/4 underripe fruit. Do not use commercially
canned or frozen fruit juices. Their pectin content is too low. Wash
all fruits thoroughly before cooking. Crush soft fruits or berries;
cut firmer fruits into small pieces. Using the peels and cores adds
pectin to the juice during cooking. Add water to fruits that require
it, as listed in the table of ingredients below. Put fruit and water
in large saucepan and bring to a boil. Then simmer according to the
times below until fruit is soft, while stirring to prevent scorching.
One pound of fruit should yield at least 1 cup of clear juice.
EXTRACTING JUICES AND MAKING JELLY

To Extract Juice:

Fruit: Apples. Cups of Water to be Added per Pound of Fruit: 1.
Minutes to Simmer Fruit before Extracting Juice: 20 to 25. Sugar to
be added to each cup of Strained Juice: 3/4 cup. Lemon Juice to be
added to each cup of Strained Juice: 1-1/2 tsp (opt). Yield from 4
Cups of Juice: 4 to 5 half-pints.

Fruit: Blackberries. Cups of Water to be Added per Pound of Fruit:
None or 1/4. Minutes to Simmer Fruit before Extracting Juice: 5 to
10. Sugar to be added to each cup of Strained Juice: 3/4 to 1 cup.
Lemon Juice to be added to each cup of Strained Juice: None. Yield
from 4 Cups of Juice: 7 to 8 half-pints.

Fruit: Crab Apples. Cups of Water to be Added per Pound of Fruit: 1.
Minutes to Simmer Fruit before Extracting Juice: 20 to 25. Sugar to be
added to each cup of Strained Juice: 1 cup. Lemon Juice to be added
to each cup of Strained Juice: None. Yield from 4 Cups of Juice: 4 to
5 half-pints.

Fruit: Grapes. Cups of Water to be Added per Pound of Fruit: None or
1/4. Minutes to Simmer Fruit before Extracting Juice: 5 to 10. Sugar
to be added to each cup of Strained Juice: 3/4 to 1 cup. Lemon Juice
to be added to each cup of Strained Juice: None. Yield from 4 Cups of
Juice: 8 to 9 half-pints.

Fruit: Plums. Cups of Water to be Added per Pound of Fruit: 1/2.
Minutes to Simmer Fruit before Extracting Juice: 15 to 20. Sugar to
be added to each cup of Strained Juice: 3/4 cup. Lemon Juice to be
added to each cup of Strained Juice: None. Yield from 4 Cups of
Juice: 8 to 9 half-pints. When fruit is tender, strain through a
colander, then strain through a double layer of cheesecloth or a
jelly bag. Allow juice to drip through, using a stand or colander to
hold the bag. Pressing or squeezing the bag or cloth will cause
cloudy jelly.

Using no more than 6 to 8 cups of extracted fruit juice at a time,
measure fruit juice, sugar, and lemon juice according to the
ingredients in the table and heat to boiling. Stir until the sugar is
dissolved. Boil over high heat to the jellying point. To test jelly
for doneness, use one of the following methods.

Temperature test: Use a jelly or candy thermometer and boil until
mixture reaches the following temperatures at the altitudes of:

Sea Level: 220 degrees F.
1,000 ft: 218 degrees F.
2,000 ft: 216 degrees F.
3,000 ft: 214 degrees F.
4,000 ft: 212 degrees F.
5,000 ft: 211 degrees F.
6,000 ft: 209 degrees F.
7,000 ft: 207 degrees F.
8,000 ft: 205 degrees F.

Sheet or spoon test: Dip a cool metal spoon into the boiling jelly
mixture. Raise the spoon about 12 inches above the pan (out of
steam). Turn the spoon so the liquid runs off the side. The jelly is
done when the syrup forms two drops that flow together and sheet or
hang off the edge of the spoon.

Remove from heat and quickly skim off foam. Fill sterile jars with
jelly. For more information see "Jars and Lids". Use a measuring cup
or ladle the jelly through a wide-mouthed funnel, leaving 1/4-inch
headspace. Adjust lids and process.

Recommended process time for Jelly without Added Pectin in a
boiling-water canner.

Style of Pack: Hot. Jar Size: Half-pints or Pints. Process Time at
Altitudes of 0 - 1,000 ft: 5 min.
1,001 - 6,000 ft: 10 min.
Above 6,000 ft: 15 min.
