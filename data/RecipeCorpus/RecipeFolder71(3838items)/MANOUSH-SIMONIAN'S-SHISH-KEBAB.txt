Remove all visible fat and gristle from lamb and cut into 1 1/2"
cubes.

Thinly slice 1 onion. Combine sliced onion, parsley, olive oil,
vinegar, cumin, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Mix well. Add
lamb cubes and stir to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate several
hours or overnight.

Cut remaining 4 onions in quarters. Cut bell peppers into 2-inch
pieces.

Thread lamb cubes onto skewers. Thread tomatoes, onions and bell
peppers onto separate skewers to allow for individual cooking times.
Grill lamb kebabs over hot coals, turning occasionally to cook lamb
evenly, about 15 minutes. Then place vegetables over coals and cook
until tender, about 5 to 10 minutes. Serve skewers over a bed of rice.
