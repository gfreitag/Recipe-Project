9    Lamb shanks
2 lg Leeks, chopped
3    Cloves garlic, chopped
2    Rashers bacon, chopped
500 g  Brown lentils
1    Sliced carrot
1    Stalk celery, sliced
1 tb Chopped fresh oregano
Red wine *
Salt and pepper to taste
* Red wine and water to cover.

Lamb shanks, which cost next to nothing, develop a succulent
gelatinous quality when cooked slowly, and saturate the lentils with
flavour.

In a little olive oil, brown nine lamb shanks (get the butcher to saw
them into pieces) on all sides. Transfer to a large pan. In the same
oil, fry 2 large leeks, 3 cloves garlic, chopped together with 2
rashers of bacon, chopped, until the leeks are soft.

Add the onion and bacon mixture to the saucepan, then add 500 g brown
lentils, a sliced carrot, a stick of celery, sliced, a tablespoonful
of chopped fresh oregano (or use dried) and cover with a mixture of
red wine and water. Do not season at this stage.

Cook very slowly for about 2 hours or until the lamb shanks are very
tender. Check from time to time to make sure the pot does not boil
dry and add more liquid if necessary.

Towards the end of the cooking time, taste and season. Transfer to a
serving dish and scatter liberally with chopped parsley.
