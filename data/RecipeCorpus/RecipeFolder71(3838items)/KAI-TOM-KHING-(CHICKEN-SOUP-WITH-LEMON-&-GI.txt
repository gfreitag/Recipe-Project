Categories: Poultry

2 tb Olive oil
1    Clove garlic, chopped
12 oz Chicken breast, diced

Coriander leaves
Here's another simple recipe.  Straw mushrooms are
available canned in the Oriental section of many
supermarkets or fresh in Asian groceries. Enoki
mushrooms would probably be a good substitute,
although I haven't tried that...

Heat the oil in a saucepan or wok and fry the garlic
until soft but not brown.

Add the chicken and stir-fry for 5 minutes. cool a
little. Add the water and mushrooms.  Bring to the
boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the lemon juice.
Cover, and cook gently for a further 10 minutes.

Add the chilies, spring onions and ginger.  Remove
from the heat. Sprinkle with coriander leaves before
serving.
