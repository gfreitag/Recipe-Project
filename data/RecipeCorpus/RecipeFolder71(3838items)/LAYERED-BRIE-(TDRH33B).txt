We attended a birthday party last night and i managed to wangle the
recipe for the stuffed french bread,well they also had two types of
warm brie,one with warm apples and raisins on top and this one. How
my sister managed to get this recipe i don't know,but she did some
fancy----> foot work and just called me with this Using large sharp
knife cut chilled brie horizontally into 3 layers.Arrange capicolla
on the bottom piece.Place----> middle section of brie on top of
bottom one and layer it with pastrami.Top with last piece of
brie;wrap entire wheel in prosciutto.Cover and chill.Thaw pastry 20
min;unfold and roll on floured surface to a 14 inch square,trim to a
14 in circle (reserve trimmings) Place brie in center of pastry;brush
pastry edges with egg mixture.Fold pastry over brie,trimming edges as
necessary,to enclose cheese.Place on baking sheet;--> seam-side
down;brush with more egg and garnish with pastry trimmings;brush with
egg and bake at 375 for 25 minutes or til pastry is golden.Remove
from oven and transfer to wire rack,let cool 30 minutes before
serving. This was terrific,espically as we were outside to begin the
party and it was a bit chilly,the brie was warm and with a glass or
two of wine,ahhh! enjoy those who try :)  cj :) FROM:    CAROLE TOSO
