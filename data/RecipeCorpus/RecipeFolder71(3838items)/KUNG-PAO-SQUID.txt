Cut cleaned squid tubes lengthwise to open; lay flat
on a cutting board. Holding a long sharp knife at a
slight angle to the board, score the inside of the
squid tube diagonally in one direction every 1/4 inch.
Turn the squid 1/4 round and score again to produce a
crosshatch pattern. Repeat with all squid. Be careful
not to cut all the way through. Cutting along score
lines, cut each squid tube crosswise into 3/4 inch
wide strips. (The scoring will make each strip curl
when cooked.)

Combine marinade ingredients in a medium bowl. Add
squid and stir to coat; set squid aside. In separate
small bowls, combine chili seasoning and sauce
ingredients; set aside.

Place a wok or 10 to 12 inch frying pan over high
heat. When hot, add 1 tablespoon of the oil and swirl
to coat cooking surface. Add squid and stir until
opaque, 3/4 to 2 minutes. Transfer squid to a bowl.

Add remaining tablespoon of oil to wok. Add chili
seasoning and stir until fragrant, about 10 seconds
(press lightly on whole chilies to release their heat).

Add celery, bell pepper, onion and bamboo shoots and
stir for 2 minutes. Stir in sauce mixture, cover and
cook 1 minute more. Return squid and their juices to
the wok and add cornstarch mixture. Stir until sauce
boils and thickens slightly. Serve over rice. Makes 4
servings.
