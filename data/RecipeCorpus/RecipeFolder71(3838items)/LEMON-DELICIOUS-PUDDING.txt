Title: LEMON DELICIOUS PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
3    Eggs, size 3 (medium)
1 tb Self-raising flour
2 2/3 oz Castor (fine) sugar
7/8 c  Milk
2    Large lemons (3 small)
Pinch of salt
1 tb Icing (confectioners) sugar
Butter for greasing
Separate the eggs. Sift the flour. Fine grate most of rind off the
lemons and extract juice.

Beat the yolks with the caster (fine grain) sugar until light, pale
and creamy. Whisk the milk, flour, lemon juice and rind into the egg
yolk mix.

In another bowl whisk the egg whites with the salt, adding the icing
sugar gradually (I sieve it through a tea strainer). Continue to
whisk until stiff but not dry (important!). Fold into the lemon
mixture.

Grease a deep 1 litre ovenproof dish (I use a 2 lb non-stick bread
tin). Pour the mixture into it. Stand the dish in a shallow pan of
cold water (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch ) and bake in a moderate oven at
180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 1 hour (check after 50 minutes and see if
top is becoming dark brown - if so remove).

Note: This pudding has a light spongy top with lemon sauce
underneath. It is quite tart - the way I love it ~ but I suppose
those of the sweet tooth may want to add more sugar or put less rind
in.

Time: 1.5 hours. Source: Mrs Beeton's cookery and household
