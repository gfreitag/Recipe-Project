This square is wonderful.  A friend brought it for a party one night
and everyone raved about it and kept coming back until it was
finished! It is a lot of work and time consuming as you have to wait
for each layer to cool before you can add the next, but once you
taste it, you will think the work is WELL worthwhile....

FIRST LAYER

FIRST LAYER:  Mix flour, butter and nuts together until crumbly.
Press into 9x13 pan. Bake in 350 F oven for 15 minutes. SECOND LAYER:
Beat cheese and icing sugar together well.  Beat whipping cream until
stiff. Fold into cream cheese mixture.  Spread over cooled crust.
THIRD LAYER: Prepare lemon pie fillings according to directions of
package. Cool, stirring often. Pour over cheese layer. FOURTH LAYER:
Beat cream, sugar and vanilla until stiff. Spread over lemon layer.
Garnish with chopped pecans, of slivered almonds. Makes 15 generous
servings.
