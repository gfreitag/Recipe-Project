Title: KABOCHA SQUASH CHOWDER
Categories: Soups
Yield: 8 Servings
6 oz Bacon; diced
1    Yellow onion; peel/dice
1    Red bell pepper; dice
2    Stalks celery; dice
1/4 bn Fresh thyme; chopped
1/4 bn Fresh oregano; chopped
1 tb Garlic; chopped
2 tb Flour
1 1/2    Kabocha; peel/seed/dice
2 qt Chicken stock
2    Bay leaves
2 ts Salt
1 ts Fresh ground pepper
1/2 bn Scallions; sliced thin
1/4 bn Parsley; chopped
Chopped smoked almonds
Render the diced bacon until crispy; drain and
reserve.  Using a little of the bacon fat, slowly
sweat the celery, onion and peppers with 1/4 teaspoon
salt. When soft, add the garlic and chopped herbs and
cook until fragrant, about 2  minutes. Add the flour
and cook for another 2 minutes. Add in a third of the
stock, bring to a boil stirring constantly, add the
remaining stock and the diced squash and bay leaves.

Let simmer slowly, until the squash is tender; it will
thicken and color the soup as it softens. The squash
should be soft but still hold its shape. Season with
salt  and pepper. Off the heat, add the scallions, the
bacon and  parsley, garnish with toasted or smoked
chopped almonds or walnuts for a nice crunch.
