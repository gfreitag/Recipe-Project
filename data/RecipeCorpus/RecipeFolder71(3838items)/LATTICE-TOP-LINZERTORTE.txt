Title: LATTICE-TOP LINZERTORTE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
1 c  Flour
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  + 2 tb unsalted butter,
-softened
2/3 c  Sugar
1    Egg
6 oz Chopped walnuts, ground
1 ts Finely grated lemon zest
1/2 c  Seedless raspberry jam
Adjust rack to lower third of oven; preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Sift the flour, cinnamon, salt and baking powder onto a strip of
waxed paper.

Combine the butter and sugar in a large bowl; beat until smooth. Add
the egg and beat until well blended. Stir in flour mixture, nuts and
lemon zest just until thoroughly blended.

Divide dough in half. Using floured fingertips, pat half of the dough
evenly into an ungreased 9-inch square baking pan. Spread jam evenly
over the dough, stopping 1/2-inch from edges. Set aside.

Roll the remaining dough between 2 pieces of waxed paper to a 9-inch
square. Place on a baking sheet and refrigerate until firm. Cut dough
into 14 strips, each 1/2 inch wide. Evenly space 7 of the strips over
the torte in one direction. Place remaining strips at right angles to
the first strips, creating a lattice pattern. This technique is not
actually weaving, but the results are just as impressive.

Bake for 45 minutes, or until light golden. Cool completely before
cutting into 2-inch squares.

Yields 16 squares. PER SQUARE: 225 calories, 3 g protein, 23 g
