Title: KARTOFFELKNOEDEL (POTATO DUMPLINGS)
Categories: Vegetables, German
Yield: 4 Servings

(7 oz)

This refers to dumplings made from boiled potatoes
which is the traditional Swabian method.  Dumplings
made from raw potatoes originated in Bavaria and
reached Swabian kitchens relatively late.

Beat the butter and egg until fluffy.  Add the cold,
grated, boiled potatoes, bread crumbs, salt, and
pepper, and knead well. Depending on how watery the
potatoes are, flour may be substituted for the bread
crumbs in order to get a dough that is neither too
firm not to pasty.

Form dumplings, and cook in barely simmering salted
water for 15 minutes.

Serve immediately, while still piping hot.

These dumplings are also very popular as a main dish,
with brown gravy.

Serves 4.
