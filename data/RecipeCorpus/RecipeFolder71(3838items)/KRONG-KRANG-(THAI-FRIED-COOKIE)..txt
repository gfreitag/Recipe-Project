Categories: Cookies, Thai
Yield: 1 Batch
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
2 c  Flour
1 ea Egg Yolk
1/2 c  Coconut Cream *
3 tb Lime Water (CaCO3 Solution)
Oil for Frying
MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
1 tb Cilantro Roots, Chopped Fine
1 ts Ground Black Pepper
1 ts Salt
3/4 c  Coconut Sugar
2 tb Jasmine Water (Extract)
* Coconut cream is the rich heavier portion of coconut
milk, either from the first "pressing", or skimmed of
the top of coconut milk that's been set aside for
about an hour in the refrigerator. Sift the flour and
add egg yolk.  Knead the yolk into the flour while
slowly adding the coconut cream and lime water.  Knead
until the dough is soft and shiny.  Divide the dough
into small round balls, approximately 1 inch in
diameter. You may make it larger or smaller, if
desired. The dough ball is then "formed" onto a
grooved wooden form into a small thin sheet, with
"ridges" on one side.  Fry the formed dough in hot oil
till golden brown.  Drain well and set aside to cool
completely. In the meantime, add jasmine water to the
coconut sugar in a good size frying pan over a low
heat.  When the sugar is fully melted and combined
with the jasmine water, add the cilantro roots, salt,
and peppers that had been previously blended together.
Turn the heat up to medium and mix all the ingredients
well.  Continue to stir, preventing the syrup from
burning, until the syrup is "fragrant". Add the cooled
fried dough and distribute the syrup all over the
dough. Remove the coated dough pieces from the pan and
spread out to cool on a tray lined with waxed paper.
When cold, they may be stored in air-tight container.
