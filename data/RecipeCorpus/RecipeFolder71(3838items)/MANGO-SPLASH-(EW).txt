Title: MANGO SPLASH (EW)
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 12 Servings
4    Ripe mangos
1/3 c  Curacao or other orange-
-flavored cordial
3 tb Fresh lime juice
3 tb Sugar
2    Bottles sarkling white wine,
-chilled
Lime wedges for garnish
Note - Before buying the mangoes, sniff them:  they should have a
pleasant, sweet aroma.  For the bubbles, choose a not-too-sweet
sparkling wine, such as a French cremant de Bourgogne or an Italian
prosecco. For a nonalcoholic cocktail, mix with ginger ale.

Hold a mango stem-end up and slice flesh away from the long flat
stone in long, vertical sections.  Slice the flesh from the skin.
Repeat these steps with the remaining mangoes. Cut 12 thin, uniform
slices for garnish and set them aside.  Press the remaining mango
slices through a strainer into a bowl.  (You should have 1 1/2 cups
mango puree.) Stir in curacao, lime juice and sugar.  (The mango
puree and garnish can be prepared up to 8 hours ahead and stored in
spearate covered containers in the refrigerator). Pour about 2 Tbsp.
mango puree into a glass, top with sparkling wine, garnish with a
lime wedge and a mango slice and serve.
