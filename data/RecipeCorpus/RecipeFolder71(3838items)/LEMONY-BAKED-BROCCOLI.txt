Categories: Casseroles, Cheese/eggs, Harned 1994, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
2 md Broccoli heads*
1 ts Grated lemon rind
2 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Fresh parsley; fine chopped
1/4 c  Fresh basil; finely chopped
Pepper; to taste
1/3 c  Tomato sauce
-- fresh or canned
6 sl Mozzarella cheese (4 oz.) or
1 c  Grated mozzarella
*Broccoli should be cut into medium florets with 1" stems, for a
total of about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lbs.

Bring a pot of water to a boil; boil or steam broccoli until it is
tender-crisp and done but not overcooked. Immediately transfer to a
bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process and to keep the
broccoli bright green.  Drain.

Put broccoli into a well-buttered casserole dish; sprinkle with lemon
rind, lemon juice, parsley and basil. Add pepper to taste. Spread
tomato sauce over top and cover with cheese. Bake until hot and
bubbly, about 10 minutes, at 350 F.  Serve immediately.
