Title: LEMON SLICE MUFFINS
Categories: Muffins, Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
3    Lemons
1 tb Water
1/2 c  Sugar, Or More, If Needed
6 tb Unsalted Butter
2 c  Flour
2 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Baking Soda
1/2 ts Salt
2    Eggs
1 c  Milk
Preheat oven to 400Ã¸F.  Butter standard size muffin tins. Finely
grate the zest from the lemons, removing only the bright yellow
portion of the peel. Set the lemons aside. Combine the zest, the
water and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a small saucepan.  Stir over medium
heat for about 2 minutes, just until the sugar dissolves. Add the
butter and stir until melted, about 1 minute longer.  Set aside. With
a sharp knife remove and discard all the remaining peel from the
lemons. Cut the lemons crosswise into slices about 1/4 inch thick;
discard any seeds.  You will need about 12 nicely shaped slices. Put
about 1 teaspoon of the remaining sugar in the bottom of each
prepared muffin cup and place a lemon slice on top. In a medium bowl,
stir and toss together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and
salt. Set aside. In a larger bowl whisk together the eggs, milk and
the reserved lemon mixture until smooth.  Add the combined dry
ingredients and stir just until blended. Spoon into the tins, filling
about 3/4 full. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, 15 - 20
minutes. Immediately invert the tins; the muffins should fall out. If
they resist, nudge them with a knife. * Makes about 12 standard
muffins. * Source: Williams Sonoma Kitchen Library, Muffins and
