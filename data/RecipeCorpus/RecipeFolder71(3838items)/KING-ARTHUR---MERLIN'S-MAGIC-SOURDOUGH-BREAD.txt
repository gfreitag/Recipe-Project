Title: KING ARTHUR - MERLIN'S MAGIC SOURDOUGH BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Sourdough starter
1/2 c  Warm water
1 tb Active dry yeast
3 tb Vital wheat gluten
1 tb Salt
1/4 c  Olive oil
5 c  (approx.) King Arthur
-Unbleached All-Purpose
Flour

Mix the starter, water, yeast and gluten together.
Add 3 cups of the flour.  Cover with a damp towel and
let this sponge sit overnight. The next day, add the
salt, oil, and stir in flour until the dough is a
shaggy mass. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
counter and knead the dough adding more flour as
necessary until the dough is a smooth ball. The dough
should not be sticky.  Place the dough in a lightly
oiled bowl and let the dough rise for about 2 hours.
The dough should double in size.

Punch down the dough and divide it into 2 pieces.
Knead each piece briefly on a lightly floured counter.
Form each piece into a round ball and place on a
baking sheet that has been greased and sprinkled with
cornmeal. Cover the loaves with a damp towel and let
them rise for 45 to 60 minutes or until slightly
swollen.  While the loaves are fising, preheat the
oven to 375 degrees.  Make 3 slashes that are about 4"
long and 1/2" deep on the top of each loaf. This will
help the loaves to rise evenly in the oven. Bake for
35 minutes or until browned and the bottoms sound
hollow when thumped.
