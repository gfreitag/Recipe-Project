Title: MACHINE PAIN DE MIE
Categories: Breadmaker, Ethnic
Yield: 12 Servings
-Sarah\CA (MPFP29B)
2 c  Bread flour
1 1/2 ts Yeast; more or less
1/2 c  Semolina flour
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/3 c  Instant nonfat dry milk soli
1 tb Unsalted butter
7/8 c  (1c minus 2T) water
Here's the recipe you requested. This makes one 1 lb loaf on the basic
bread setting. 1. Place all the ingredients in the bread pan and
process on the standard bread setting. 2. Remove bread from the pan
and cool on a rack. Wrap in a plastic bag or foil to store. The
author says that the addition of semolina flour seems to give the
bread that close; even grain required for this type of bread. You can
slice this bread as thin as you like; you can use it for canapes or
fancy sandwiches; you can make melbas or croutons from it once it's 2
or 3 days old. Have fun! Sarah\CA Reformatted by Elaine Radis
