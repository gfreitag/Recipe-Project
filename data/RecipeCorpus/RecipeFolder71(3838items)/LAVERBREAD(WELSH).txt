BARA LAWNR Laverbread is a smooth fine seaweed found ofi ths shores of
South Wales. It is gathered daily in places like Penclawdd. The
seaweed is thoroughly washed to remove all sand and grit. It is then
boiled for 5-6 hours until it is quite soft. The liquid is drained
off. This prspared laverbread is sold frQm wooden tubs lined with
white cloths in the markets of Wales. It should be used and eaten as
soon as possible. Divide the laverbread into four and coat with
oatmeal. Fry gently for 5-10 minutes in bacon fat. Grill or fry the
bacon in another pan. Serve hot. A little vinegar over the laverbread
brings out its delicate flavour.
