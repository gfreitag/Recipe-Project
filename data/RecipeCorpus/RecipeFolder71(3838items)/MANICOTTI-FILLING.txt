Saute scallions in 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small frying pan for
about 5 minutes (if desired, you can use them uncooked as well).
Meanwhile, in a large bowl whisk eggs slightly. Add remaining
ingredients to bowl, including scallions, stirring to mix with a
large heavy spoon. NOTE: When adding spinach, try to break it up as
you add it, mixing will be much easier.

Cook pre-packaged Manicotti shells following package directions, only
UNDERcook them by about 2 minutes. (Undercooking will make them less
likely to break, and they will absorb any excess moisture released by
the cheeses during baking.)

Stuff manicotti carefully with filling. Place a little bit of sauce in
bottom of baking dish, and place manicotti side by side in one layer
in baking dish. Spoon sauce over, sprinkle with a little additional
Parmesan cheese. Cover and bake at 325 degrees for 30 minutes,
uncover and bake 10 minutes more until bubbly.
