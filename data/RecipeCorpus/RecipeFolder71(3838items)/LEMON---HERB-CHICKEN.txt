Place chicken pieces in a glass or ceramic bowl. Mix marinade
ingredients until smooth and well blended. Reserve 1/3 cup, covered
and refrigerated, for basting while grilling. Pour remaining marinade
over chicken, turning pieces to coat completely. Marinade, covered
for 6 to 8 hours or overnight, turning occasionally. Remove chicken
from refrigerator 20 to 30 minutes before you are ready to grill,
leaving container covered. When coals are covered with gray ash, oil
the grill rack. Cook chicken, skin side down first, for about 15
minutes on each side, brushing with the reserved marinade. Watch
carefully, as uncovered grills will cook the exteriors faster than a
covered grill. Pieces are done when exterior is golden brown and
clear juices run when the chicken is pierced with a sharp fork.
Discard any unused marinade. Garnish with strips of lemon peel, if
desired. Total cooking time:30 minutes. Serves 6.
