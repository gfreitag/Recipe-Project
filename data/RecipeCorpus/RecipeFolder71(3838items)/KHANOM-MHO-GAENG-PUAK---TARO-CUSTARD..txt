Title: KHANOM MHO-GAENG PUAK - TARO CUSTARD.
Categories: Desserts, Thai
Yield: 8 Servings
4 c  Coconut Milk
3 c  Palm Sugar
12 ea Eggs - beaten
3 c  Cooked taro - mashed
1 c  Shallots - thinly sliced
1 1/2 c  Oil
In a bowl, dissolve palm sugar in the coconut milk and
mix well. Strain through cheese cloth or fine sieve to
remove all solids.  Add mashed taro, eggs, and mix
well. Heat a frying pan, and add oil when it's hot.
Add thinly sliced shallots and saute until they are
crisp and golden brown.  Remove shallots from the oil,
drain and put aside. Put the hot oil into a large
sauce pan and reheat.  Add the coconut milk/egg/taro
mixture and stir constantly with large wooden spoon
over moderate heat until the mixture starts to boil
lightly and thickened. Remove from heat and pour the
mixture into a deep tray (large Pyrex tray or
rectangular sheet cake pan, for example) and bake in
350 Ã¸F oven until it's cooked through, and the surface
is nicely browned. Remove from the oven, and spread
the fried shallot pieces all over the top.  Cut into 2
inch squares, when cooled, and use a spatula to remove
from the pan onto a serving platter. NOTE:  This is a
variation of the original "Khanom Mho-Gaeng" which
uses mashed, cooked, split peas in place of the taro
("puak").
