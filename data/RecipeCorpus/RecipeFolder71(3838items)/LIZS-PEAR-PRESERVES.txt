At 1810 West Inn, what is billed as a continental breakfast can
include individual quiches, small pastry-wrapped sausages, and
biscuits with homemade preserves. The most colorful way of presenting
this recipe is to use innkeeper Virginia Whites language. She advises
that the preserves will be firmer if the pears are not too ripe.

A 5-gallon bucket filled with pears from our backyard pear trees 5
pounds of sugar. Peel, core, and slice the pears. Place in a large
heavy pot with the sugar. Let sit overnight. The next day, cook the
mixture in the same pot over very low heat, stirring frequently, for
at least 6 hours. While hot, pack into hot sterile jars and seal.
Makes 8 - 10 pints.JM.
