Title: KAY'S APRICOT FUDGE
Categories: Candies, Florida, Fruits
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Sugar
2/3 c  Water
3 tb Light Corn Syrup
1/4 ts Salt
1/3 c  Apricot Preserves
Generously grease an 8x8-inch cake pan.
In a 2-quart saucpan, mix the sugar, water, corn syrup
and salt until well combined. Stirring with a wooden
spoon, bring the batch to a full boil over high heat.
When the mixture starts to boil, cover the saucepan
and allow to boil for 1 minute.
Remove the cover and wash down the sides of the pan
with a pastry brush dipped
in hot water. Clip a candy thermometer onto the side
of the pan and cook at high heat, 5 to 8 minutes or
until mixture reaches 240 degrees. Remove the saucepan
from the heat and without removing the thermometer,
allow mixture to cool to 150 degrees and then add the
preserves. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed
for 4 minutes. Pour the mixture into the cake pan.
Allow to cool at room temperature for 45 minutes, then
with a wet knife, score
the top into 1-inch squares.
Refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove from the refrigerator
and place a piece of wax
paper on top of the fudge. Turn the pan upside down
onto to a work surface to
remove fudge from pan. Turn fudge right-side up and
with a wet knife, cut the
fudge into 1-inch pieces, wiping the blade between
each cut to insure clean slices. Wrap and store pieces
in the refrigerator.

MAKES about 3 dozen pieces.
