If there is one thing most Florida Crackers will agree
on is the proper way to make a Key Lime Pie..and one
thing we hate is how many variations there are..green
food coloring? UGH! Most of the Key lime trees in
Central Fla. have been frozen so its hard to get fresh
juice.Don't use the bottled.We use equal amounts from
Persian limes and lemons. Sweetened condensed milk was
used before re- frigeration. Eagle Brand is the old
stand-by but any brand will do. You may use a graham
cracker crust - most folks do now because it takes
chilling better than the regular pastry crust does..We
have trouble here in Florida with humidity so
sometimes we use whipped cream as a topping instead of
meringue. I always take a chance with the meringue and
if it runs the kids just say "Mom has made Key Lime
Soup again" and eat it anyhow. This recipe is the way
all my Conch relatives make it. They've been in Key
West since 1800. Beat egg yolks until pale yellow.
Blend in milk and add lime juice stirring unitl
smooth. Pour into pie shell and top with meringue or
whipped cream. Meringue Beat egg whites at high speed
until foamy. Add cream of tarter; beat until soft
peaks form ~ reduce speed and gradually add sugar.
Beat again at high speed until soft glossy peaks form.
Heap on pie , sealing the edges well and bake in 350F
oven approximately 15 minutes. Cool at room
temperature then chill. Youall enjoy ya hear... Babs
