Title: KAI'S UNFRIED RICE
Categories: Low fat, Rice
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Uncooked brown rice
1    Green pepper, chopped
1    Red, yellow or orange pepper
Chopped ( I use all
Sometimes)
2    Packs of Dried Shitake
Mushrooms or 2 packs of
Fresh
1 lg Onion thinly sliced
1 bn Scallions
Garlic - fresh or dried (to
Taste)
Ginger - fresh or dried (to
Taste)
Lite teryaki sauce
Lite soy sauce
Rice wine
1 pk Fried Rice Seasoning
(mccormick or la choy.....)
Marinate Mushrooms: Cut mushrooms into thin strips and
add appx. 1/4 cup of Rice wine, teryaki, garlic and
ginger  Let stand 1 hour to overnight.

Cook rice in rice cooker.

Heat non-stick skillet till very hot. Throw in veggies
and more diced fresh garlic, ginger and pepper.
(High heat with NO oil brings out flavors in veggies,
according to Chef Prudhomme)

Stir quickly, as they begin to become tender add rice
wine a little at a time, just to prevent
sticking/burning, not enough to make the veggies soggy.

Throw the cooked rice from the rice cooker into a big
bowl, throw in the veggies, toss around.

Add chopped scallions (uncooked, the heat from the
other stuff is enough).

Toss about to evenly distribute ingredients.

Add the Fried Rice Seasoning Packet,  Toss and serve.
