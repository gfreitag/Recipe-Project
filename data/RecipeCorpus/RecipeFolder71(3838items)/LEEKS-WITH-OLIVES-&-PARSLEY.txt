Title: LEEKS WITH OLIVES & PARSLEY
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish, Vegan
Yield: 2 Servings
225 g  Leeks; washed
- and finely sliced
4 tb Olive oil
5 tb Vegetable stock
10    Black olives
-- stoned and sliced
1 md Bunch of parsley
-- finely chopped
Salt and pepper
Strong flavours here - leeks sauted with olives and parsley - that
are reminiscent of French regional cookery. Lovely with a rice dish,
or with the crpes alla parmigiana parizzi.

Saut the sliced leeks gently in the olive oil, stirring, until they
begin to soften, about 6-8 minutes. Stir in the stock and bring to
the boil. Simmer gently, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Add the olives and
the chopped parsley, and cook, stirring occasionally, for a further
3-4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and it is ready to
serve.
