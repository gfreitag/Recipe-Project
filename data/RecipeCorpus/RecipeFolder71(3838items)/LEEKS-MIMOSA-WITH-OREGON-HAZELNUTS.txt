Title: LEEKS MIMOSA WITH OREGON HAZELNUTS
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 c  Oregon hazelnuts
2 lb Small leeks
Salt
2    Hard-cooked eggs
MMMMM--------------------PARSLEY VINAIGRETTE-------------------------
2 tb White wine vinegar
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
3 tb Hazelnut oil
3 tb Vegetable oil
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
Remove dark green ends of leeks and discard. Slit each leek lengthwise
twice, beginning halfway through center of white part and slitting
upward in direction of green tops. Dip repeatedly in a sinkful of
cold water to remove any sand. Cut off roots. In a large saucepan of
boiling salted water, cook leeks, uncovered, over medium heat about
10 minutes or until tender. Drain thoroughly. Cut in two or three
pieces crosswise. Arrange on a platter reconstructing each leek and
arranging so all point in the same direction.

Cut hard-cooked eggs in half and remove yolks. Chop egg whites
separately from yolks. In small bowl, stir vinegar with salt and
pepper, and whisk in oil. Add parsley, taste and adjust seasoning. To
serve, spoon enough dressing over leeks to moisten them. Sprinkle egg
whites in a row across their bases and then a row of hazelnuts next
to the whites, then a row of chopped yolks. Leave top ends of leeks
showing. Serve remaining dressing separately.
