1. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add sugar and shallots
and cook until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Add vinegar and cook
until evaporated. Add stock, fruit, 1 t of the chopped rosemary, and
salt and pepper to taste. Cook until shallots are tender and liquid

rosemary. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add chops and saute until brown on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn

chops are evenly browned, 3 to 4 minutes more. Garnish lamb with
rosemary sprigs and serve with the chutney.
