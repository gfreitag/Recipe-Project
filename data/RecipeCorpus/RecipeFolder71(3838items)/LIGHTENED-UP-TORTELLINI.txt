=======================================================
============== ===
1. Working with 1 skin at a time, put an equal amount chicken filling
in each center, about 1 teaspoon.
2. Moisten skin edge with egg white, fold over filling, align edges,
and press to seal. Bring pointed ends together, overlapping; moisten
ends with white and press to seal tortellini. As shaped, set on
flour-dusted baking sheets in a single layer; keep tortellini and
skins covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying. Repeat until all
skins are filled. If made ahead, chill up to 4 hours, or freeze on
baking sheets and package airtight to store.
3. In 2 pans, each 5-6 quarts, bring about 3 quarts water to a boil
over high heat. Drop 1/2 of the tortellini (unthawed, if frozen) into
each pan. Cook, uncovered, until just tender to bite, 4-5 minutes
(about 6 minutes, if frozen). If tortellini stick to each other or
pan bottom, stir very gently 1 or 2 times. Reduce heat, as needed, to
maintain a gentle simmer.
4. Pour 1/3 of the sauce into a warm bowl. Gently drain tortellini;
pour into bowl. Add remaining sauce. Top with cheese.

*** CHICKEN-PROSCIUTTO FILLING ***
1. Mince prosciutto. Bone and skin chicken breast; cut meat into 1/2"
pieces.
2. In 1 10-12" frying pan over high heat, combine onion and 1 cup
chicken broth. Boil, uncovered, until liquid evaporates and onion
starts to brown, about 12 minutes; stir often. To deglaze, add 1/3
cup water and stir to release browned bits. Boil until browning
begins again; deglaze with 1/3 cup water and boil dry. Add chicken
and prosciutto; stir until chicken is no longer pink in center (cut
to test), about 3 minutes.
3. Coarsely grind in a food processor or mince. Mix with egg white,
parmesan cheese, all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons chicken broth,
nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste. If made ahead, cover and chill
up to a day.

*** LEAN CREAM SAUCE ***
1. In a 10-12" frying pan, combine onion and 1 cup chicken broth.
Boil, uncovered, on high heat until liquid evaporates and onion
starts to brown, about 12 minutes; stir often.
2. Deglaze as directed for chicken-prosciutto filling. Repeat until
onion is browned. If made ahead, cover and chill up to a day. Mix
into onions the cornstarch, nutmeg, milk, and 1/2 cup chicken broth;
stir until boiling. Use hot.
