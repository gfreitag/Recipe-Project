1 tb Double-acting baking powder
3/4 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt

softened butter, assorted jams as accompaniments Into a bowl, sift
together the unbleached flour, brown sugar, baking powder, soda &
salt. Blend in the butter until mixture resembles coarse meal, and
stir in the whole-wheat flour, bran, walnuts & raisins until the
mixture is combined. In a small bowl, whisk together the rind, egg &
buttermilk, add this mixture to the flour mixture and stir the
mixture with a fork until it just forms a sticky but manageable
dough. Knead the dough lightly on a floured surface for 30 seconds
and pat it gently into a 3/4 inch thick round. Cut out rounds with a
2 or 2-1/4 inch cutter dipped in flour and arrange them on a buttered
baking sheet. Form the scraps into a ball, pat into 3/4 inch thick
round & repeat. Arrange the rounds on the baking sheet, brush the
tops with the egg wash, and bake the scones in the middle of a
pre-heated 400 degree oven for 15 - 17 minutes or until golden. Serve
the scones warm with the butter and jams. Per Serving: 230 calories,
