Title: L'ESTOUFFAT DE NOEL (BORDEAUX CHRISTMAS BEEF STEW)
Categories: Stews, French
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Top round
6    Carrot
2    Leek
2 lg Onion
2    Shallot
6    Garlic clove
1    Celery rib; sliced
12 sl Bacon
1    Bay leaf, Turkish
5    Parsley sprig
1 1/2 ts Peppercorns
1 1/2 T  Thyme, dried
1 ts Salt
2    Cloves, whole
1 1/4 l  Bordeaux red; decent
1/3 c  Wine vinegar, red
1/4 c  Cognac
Cut beef into 8 oz chunks.  This is important; smaller chunks will
fall apart during the long cooking.  Cut carrots in 1" chunks.  Use
only the white of the leek; halve each and wash well, then cut into
1" chunks. Slice onions thinly.  Chop shallots; peel and mash garlic
cloves. Slice celery thinly.  Cut bacon rashers (slab bacon only,
please) in 1" slices. DO NOT use California bay leaf in this recipe;
the California bay leaf has a very strong, harsh taste which will
ruin the entire dish. Look for an imported (Turkish) bay leaf.  For
the wine, use something considerably better than Gallo jug; the
instructor used a couple of $10 French Bordeaux.

Combine all ingredients in a heavy casserole (8 to 10 quarts);
marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.  Slowly bring the
casserole to a simmer while you make a luting (sealing) paste of
flour and water. When ready, put a thick strip of dough around the
lid where it meets the pot and clamp on well; then take the remaining
luting paste and seal well around the outside.  The pot should be
completely sealed; no steam (or only the occasional wisp) should
escape.  Simmer the stew at 100 F to 150 F for 8 to 10 hours in the
oven; the lower temperature and longer cooking is more desirable.
Break open the crust and serve over potato pur√©e.
