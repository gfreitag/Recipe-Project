Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins characterize this inventive, egg-free
recipe from "The New Basics" (Workman, 1989) as "a lovely, light
version of the classic".  They suggest tucking the walnut toast under
a couple of big, crisp leaves of romaine, so it's a surprise.

Heat the olive oil in a small skillet.  Add the walnuts and saute over
medium heat until lightly toasted, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside. Toast
the bread; then spread each slice with Anchovy Spread and scatter
with the toasted walnuts

Tear the lettuce into pieces and toss with the dressing. Place a
piece of prepared toast on each plate and top with a portion of the
lettuce and dressing.  Using a vegetable peeler, shave thin slices of
Parmesan over each portion.  Serve immediately.

Makes 4 servings.

ANCHOVY SPREAD: 12 anchovy fillets, drained 2 teaspoons Dijon-style
mustard 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper 2 tablespoons
extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room
temperature 1 clove garlic, finely minced Using a fork, mash the
anchovies in a small bowl. In another small bowl, whisk the remaining
ingredients together. Add to the anchovies and mix until a paste has
formed. Makes about 1/4 cup. CAESAR DRESSING: 1 teaspoon grated lemon
zest 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 cloves garlic, minced 1
teaspoon white wine vinegar 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon
coarsely ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt

smooth. Add the pepper and salt and set aside.
