Title: KOREAN SKEWERED BEEF
Categories: Korean, Beef, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 2 Servings
1 lb Sirloin steak
1    Clove garlic, crushed
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Sesame or other oil
1/4 c  Minced green onions
Toasted sesame seeds
Thinly slice steak into 1-inch wide strips.  Dip
strips into a marinade made by combining garlic with
rest of ingredients.  Now dip in crushed toasted
sesame seeds to cover the meat completely, and return
to the marinade for an hour.  Weave on bamboo sticks
and broil quickly, or, if you prefer, fry quickly in a
little oil.  (The sesame seeds are toasted by cooking
slowly in a heavy skillet, until brown. They are then
crushed in a mortar or heavy bowl, with salt.  The
mixture should not be smooth.)
