MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
1 ts Salt
1 ts Dill weed
1 ts Basil
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/4 ts White pepper
MMMMM---------------------------STUFF--------------------------------
4    Chicken breasts, boneless
1 tb + 2 ts corn starch
Green onions
1 c  Apple juice
1 1/2 c  Chicken stock, defatted
1/2 c  Lemon juice, fresh
2 ts Sugar
Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl. Sprinkle all
surfaces of the chicken evenly with 2 teaspoons of the seasoning mix
and rub it in well.

Dissolve the corn starch in 1/4 c apple juice an set aside.

Preheat a 10-inch skillet over high heat about four minutes. Place
the chicken in the skillet, but do not crowd. Lower the heat to
medium and then brown at least one minute per side. Set the chicken
aside when browned.

Reheat the skillet to high and stir in 1/2 cup of the stock,
scraping the bottom of the skillet to clear out all the brown bits.
Add the onions and the remaining seasoning mix; stir and cook until
all the liquid evaporates, about 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup of
the lemon juice, scrape the bottom of the skillet again to clear and
cook until liquid evaporates, about 3 to 4 minutes.

Add 1/2 cup of the apple juice, clear the bottom and sides of the
skillet, and cook until about half of the liquid evaporates, 2 to 3
minutes. Stir in the remaining cup stock, the 1/4 cup lemon juice,
and the 1/4 cup apple juice. Bring to a boil, whisk in the
cornstarch, and return to a boil. Return the chicken to the skillet,
lower the heat to medium, and cook 4 to 5 minutes, until the chicken
is done all the way through. Remove the chicken and whisk in the
sugar if desired. Serve immediately.
