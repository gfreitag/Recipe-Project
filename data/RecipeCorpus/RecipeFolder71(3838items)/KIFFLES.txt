Title: KIFFLES
Categories: Cookies, Desserts
Yield: 5 Servings
2 c  Flour, (heaping)
3 tb Sugar
1 tb Sour cream, heaping
1 c  Butter
3    Egg yolks
1 c  Prune butter
Cream butter, sour cream, and sugar. Add egg yolks,
then flour. Knead with hands until well blended,
adding a little more flour if needed. Divide dough
into 6-8 sections, pat each into a flat piece, then
chill. Roll out, between waxed paper, each section
like a pie crust. Cut with a sharp knife - 4 cross
cuts to make 8 triangles. Drop 1/2 teaspoon of prune
butter onto each triangle, roll up starting at wide
end. Put on greased cookie sheet. Bake 375 degrees or
till light brown. If desired, sprinkle with powdered
sugar.   Even though these have very little sugar,
they are fabulous. They even give Kolaches some stiff
competition.
