Title: KALAMARAKIA TURSI (PICKLED SQUID)
Categories: Greek, Seafood, Appetizers
Yield: 6 Servings
12 md Squid
3 tb Olive oil
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
Few sprigs fresh rosemary
2 c  White vinegar (approx.)
MMMMM------------------PICKLING SPICES & HERBS-----------------------
8    Black peppercorns
2    Garlic cloves
1    Bay leaf
1    Sprig fresh rosemary
Wash and clean the squid, separating the outer sacs
from the heads and tentacles, removing and discarding
the translucent cartilage, and small sand bag and ink.
Rub salt on the outer sacs and rinse them inside and
out with cold water. Heads and tentacles should be
rinsed thoroughly. Cut the sacs into 1/2-inch wide
rounds. Heat the oil in a frying pan and slip in the
squid rounds, heads and tentacles. Cover and simmer
until bright pink and tender (approximately 30
minutes), adding salt and pepper to taste, parsley and
rosemary during the last 15 minutes. Half fill a clean
quart-sized jar with the squid and all the juices
remaining in the pan. Add white vinegar almost to the
top, then the pickling spices and herbs. Seal the jar
tightly and shake. Marinate at least one day before
serving. Keep in the refrigerator.
To serve, remove from marinade and serve cold, within
10    days.
