Recipe by: the California Culinary Academy Preparation Time: 1:45 1.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl of electric mixer, cream
together sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Beat in lemon juice,
lemon rind, and vanilla.

2. Add eggs in 3 additions, mixing well after each.

3. Sift flour into butter mixture. Mix to blend thoroughly.

4. Spoon batter into greased 10-inch fluted or plain tube pan. Bake
until a skewer inserted in center comes out clean (1 hour to 1 hour
and 15 minutes). Cool on wire rack 15 to 20 minutes before turning
cake out of pan.

* Timesaver Tip: Cake batter can be made ahead and frozen before
baking. Wrap pan tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Label and
date. Freeze at 0 degrees F up to 4 weeks. Do not thaw. To bake,
remove foil and bake at 350 degrees F until a skewer inserted in
center comes out clean (about 1 hour and 15 to 20 minutes). If cake
starts to get too brown, cover loosely with aluminum foil the last 30
minutes of baking. Cool on wire rack 15 to 20 minutes before turning
out of pan.
