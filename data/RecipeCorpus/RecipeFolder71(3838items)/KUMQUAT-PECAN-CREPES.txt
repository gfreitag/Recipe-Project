For filling: Seed, chop and pat dry kumquats,

cups pecans, 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup butter, kumquats
and 3 tablespoons Cognac in processor or blender and

To assemble crepes: Generously butter two 7x11-inch
baking dishes. Reserve 1/3 cup filling for sauce. Fill
each crepe with about 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons filling.
Roll crepes up cigar fashion. Arrange seam side down
in single layer in prepared baking dishes. (Can be
assembled to this point 1 day ahead, covered and
refrigerated, or frozen for several days.)

Preheat oven to 350 deg. Sprinkle crepes with
remaining pecans and sugar and drizzle with melted
butter. Bake until bubbling hot, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine 1/3 cup reserved filling, 2
tablespoons Cognac and 1/3 cup reserved kumquat syrup
in small saucepan and bring to simmer over low heat.
Warm remaining Cognac in small saucepan.

To serve, arrange crepes on platter and top with
sauce. Ignite Cognac and pour over top, shaking
platter until flame subsides. Serve immediately.
