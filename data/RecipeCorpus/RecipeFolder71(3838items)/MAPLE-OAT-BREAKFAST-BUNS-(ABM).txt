Title: MAPLE-OAT BREAKFAST BUNS (ABM)
Categories: Digest, Jan., Breakfast
Yield: 1 Servings
2/3 c  Rice milk
1    Egg sub. equivalent for 1
Egg
1 tb Applesauce (sub. for
B*tt*r)
2 c  Bread flour
1/3 c  Oat flour (process rolled
Oats in food proc.)
4 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Yeast
1/3 c  Maple syrup
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1/2    To 1 cup raisins
2/3 c  Rolled oats, toasted in 350
Oven for 10min. or until
Light brown
Add the first 8 ingredients to bread machine according to
manufacturer's

instructions.  Set it for the dough setting (mine calls it the manual
cycle).  When cycle is complete, remove dough from machine. Cover and
let rise 10 min. In a small saucepan, stir together the syrup, spices
and brown sugar. Cook over low heat until sugar is dissolved, remove
from heat and stir in raisins and toasted rolled oats. Set aside.

On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 12x8 rectangle. Spread
raisin mixture over dough to all edges. Roll up jelly roll style,
pinch seams to seal. Cut into 1 inch slices. Place rolls, cut sides
down, on non stick cookie sheet. I gave my sheet a couple of spritzs
with cooking spray and I think it helped. When the rolls come out,
you need to use a spatula to pry them off the pan, because the brown
sugar will have stuck, but they come right up. These had just the
right amount of sweetness. Enjoy!
