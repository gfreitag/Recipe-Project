Title: MAPLE SPONGE CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 10 Servings
1 c  Maple syrup
1 c  Flour
6 ea Eggs
1 ts Vanilla (optional)
Separate eggs.  Put whites in large bowl, yolks in medium bowl. Sift
flour several times, put in small bowl. Beat egg whites until stiff,
but not dry. Set aside. Beat yolks until light, add syrup ( and
vanilla if desired). Beat again to mix well. Pour yolk syrup mixture
into whites and fold gently with wire whip until blended. Gradually
add flour 1 tbsp. at a time while folding mixture.  When blended,
pour in large tube pan. (It seems to come out best if this pan is
lightly greased with butter and dusted with flour). Bake at 325Ã¸ for
about 1 hr.  Cool on rack, then remove cake from pan. This cake is
especially good with no frosting but berries and whipped cream. From
