"The flavor of commercial buttermilk varies enormously
from dairy to dairy. Natural fresh buttermilk, if
available, would be ideal for this unusual summer
luncheon or dessert soup, but cultured buttermilk of
good flavor will do almost as well." With an electric
beater or wire whisk, beat the egg yolks in a large
bowl. Gradually add the sugar, beating until the eggs
fall back into the bowl in a lazy ribbon when the
beater is lifted. Add the grated lemon rind and juice
and the optional vanilla. Slowly beat in the
buttermilk, continuing to beat until the soup is
smooth. Serve in chilled bowls and float a spoonfull
of unsweetened whipped cream on the surface of each
service if you like. Buttermilk soup is traditionally
served with Oat Cakes. (See recipe.)
