Chef: "Apply garlic salt and pepper generously on the lobster after
you slice it in half and fry the lobster in lard for a couple of
minutes. That's it. That's my big secret." Actually, Iraola, like
most of the chefs and cooks in Puerto Nuevo, depends heavily on lard
(not oil)... uses it for everything, even the rice. However, those
who will notor cannot venture into this artery-clogging cuisine, can
try *langosta al vapor* or steamed lobster, with what they call here
the honeymooner's salad, "lettuce alone," with a little Italian
dressing on the side.
