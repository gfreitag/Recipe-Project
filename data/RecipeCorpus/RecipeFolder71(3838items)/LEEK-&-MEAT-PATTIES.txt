Yield: 30 Patties
-JUDI M. PHELPS
2 lg Bunches fresh leeks; (about
8 medium size)
1 lb Lean ground beef
2 lg Eggs; beaten
1/4 c  Matzo meal or
Matzo cake meal
1 ts ;salt
1/4 ts Ground black pepper
MMMMM-------------------------FOR FRYING------------------------------
1/2 c  Matzo cake meal; for
-coating
Vegetable oil
3    To 4 large eggs; beaten
To clean the leeks, cut off and discard the roots and all but 1 to 2
inches of the green tops.  Slice the leeks in half lengthwise and
rinse them very well under cool running water to remove any grit.
Coarsely chop the leeks and put them in a saucepan with water to
cover. Simmer them, covered, for 20 to 30 minutes, or until they are
very tender.

Drain the leeks well; then cool them until they can be handled. Use
your hands to squeeze out all the excess liquid. Grind the leeks in a
meat grinder (or very coarsely puree them with a food processor).

In a medium-size bowl, combine the leeks with the ground beef, eggs,
1/4 cup matzo meal, salt, and pepper. Use your hands or a fork to
blend them well. The mixture should be soft, but firm enough to be
molded into patties.  Add more matzo meal, if necessary.

Form the leek-meat mixture into small patties about 2 inches wide and
1/2-inch thick, coating each with cake meal to make it easier to
shape. In a large skillet, over medium heat, heat oil that is about
1/4-inch deep until it is hot but not smoking.  Dip each patty into
the beaten egg to coat it and drain off the excess; then immediately
set it in the hot oil. Fry the patties until they are golden brown on
both sides.
Makes about thirty 2-inch patties.  Source:  The Jewish Holiday
