Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
12 ea Strips lasagne; to 15
4 tb Olive oil
1 lg Onion; chopped
2 cl Garlic; crushed
2 1/4 oz Packet TVP mince
3 ea 16 oz cans chopped tomatoes
1 ts Oregano
;Salt and pepper to taste
;stock or veg water
1 c  Cottage cheese
1 c  Cheddar; grated
Preheat oven 350.

Place lasagne strips in saucepan, cover with water, and boil for a few
minutes until they are starting to soften.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan and saute the onion and garlic. Add
the TVP mince, chopped tomatoes with their juice, oregano, salt and
pepper. Simmer 20-30 mins, adding a little stock or water if
necessary to make a moist sauce. Remove from heat.

Pour a layer of tomato sauce in a deep, large baking dish. Spoon a
layer of cottage cheese over the sauce, then arrange a layer of
lasagne over that, followed by a layer of grated cheddar. Repeat this
layering process until you are about 1 1/2 inches away from the top
of the baking dish. Finish with a layer of tomato sauce topped by a
final layer of cheddar cheese.

Bake the lasagne 30 mins, until the cheese is brown and bubbly.
