Crust:
Melt butter and combine with crumbs and sugar in food
processor or with a fork until blended. Press small
amounts of mix all the way up sides of an ungreased
springform and then press the remaining crumbs over
bottom of springform.

Filling:
In mixer; whip cream cheese on highspeed for 5
minutes. Add sugar and beat for 2 min. more. Add lemon
juice and salt and blend together thoroughly. Add the
eggs, one at a time, keeping the mixer on the lowest
speed (just until each egg has been incorporated into
batter. Fold in Brazil nuts with a spatula.

IF USING FOOD PROCESSOR:
Put sugar in first. Cut each 8 oz. block of cream
cheese into eight 1" cubes and add the first 8 cubes
to bowl. Process using on-off pulse about 25 times and
then add rest of cream cheese gradually, until mixture
is smooth and creamy. When it looks perfect, blend
non-stop for 20 seconds more and then blend in lemon
juice and salt for 10 seconds. Crack eggs in a bowl,
break them up slightly with a fork, and then add them
to batter in processor bowl, and fold them lightly
into batter with rubber spatula preventing them from
sinking to bottom. Cut the eggs in batter by using
on-off pulse 10 times. Scrape down sides with spatula
and pulse on-off 5 times more. Fold in nuts with a
rubber spatula.
Pour batter into crust and bake at 350 for 55 minutes.
Let cool for 10 minutes before you glaze.

Topping:
Combine evenly and smoothly over top of baked filling,
sprinkle nuts around border, grate lemon zest into the
center as decoration, and return to 350 degree oven
for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and immediately place
in refrigerator to cool to prevent cracks from forming
in cake.

HINT: Most cheesecakes can be kosher for Passover if
you replace whatever crumbs are call for in crust with
nuts or kosher cookie crumbs. Hope you enjoy! Wendy
