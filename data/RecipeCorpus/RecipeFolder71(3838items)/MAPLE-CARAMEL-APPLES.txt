Title: MAPLE CARAMEL APPLES
Categories: New, Text, Import
1 lb dark brown sugar
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  maple syrup
1/2 c  heavy cream
1 TB unsalted butter
10    Granny Smith or other tart
apples -- chilled
:

In a deep heavy saucepan combine the brown sugar, maple syrup, and
cream and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring and washing
down any sugar crystals clinging to the sides of the pan with a brush
dipped in cold water, until the sugar is dissolved. Bring the mixture
to a boil and boil it, undisturbed, until a candy thermometer
registers 250 degrees F. Remove the pan from the heat, add the
butter, and swirl the pan gently until the butter is melted. Let the
maple caramel cool for 5 minutes.

Push a wooden skewer or chopstick through the length of each apple and
holding the apples by the skewers dip the apples 1 at a time in the
maple caramel, coating them well and letting the excess drip off. Put
the apples on buttered baking sheets until the maple caramel is cool
and firm. Serve the apples immediately.

Yield: 10 caramel apple
