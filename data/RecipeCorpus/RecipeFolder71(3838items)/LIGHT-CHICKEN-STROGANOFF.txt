1/2 c  Dry-packed sun-dried tomatos
1 lb Boneless, skinless chicken
Breast cut into 1/2 inch
Wide strips
1 1/2 tb Flour
1 1/2 tb Olive oil, divided
1 md Onion, thinly sliced
1/2 lb Mushrooms, thinly sliced
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1/2 ts Dried thyme, crushed
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
4 ts Corn starch or arrowroot

1 c  Plain low-fat yogurt
1/2 c  Dry white wine
2 tb Dry sherry
1/2 c  Chicken broth
1/2 ts Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
8 oz Medium egg noodles
2 tb Finely minced parsley
Bring a large pot of water to the boil. In a bowl, soak tomatoes in
hot water to cover until very soft, about 1 hour. Drain well, cut
into strips and set aside. Dust chicken strips in flour. Heat 1 T oil
in a wide non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken,
about half at a time, and cook, lifting and turning often, until
lightly browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes. Remove from the
pan and set aside. When chicken has been cooked, add the remaining 1
1/2 t oil. Add onion anc cook 5 minutes. (if onion start to stick,
add a little water to the pan.) Add the mushrooms, garlic, thyme and
cayenne. Cook until the mushrooms have softened, about 7 to 10
minutes. Meanwhile, stir the dissolved cornstarch into the yogurt and
set aside. Add the wine and sherry to the mushrooms and cook until
the liquid has almost evaporated, stir in the broth. Turn the heat to
medium-low and take the pan off the heat. Stir some of the hot
vegetables into the yegurt, then stir the yogurt into the pan. Add
the dried tomatoes, salt and lots of black pepper. Place on the heat
and stir several minutes until the sauce is lightly thickened. Stir
in the chicken and heat through. Place the noodles into the boiling
water and cook according to package directions. Drain. Spoon the
stroganoff on top of the noodles and garnish with parsley.
