Title: KARTAEUSERKLOESSE (CARTHUSIAN DUMPLINGS)
Categories: Desserts, German
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Stale, hard [kaiser-type]
-rolls
1    Egg
1/4 l  Milk (1 cup plus 1 Tbsp)
Grated peel of 1 lemon
20 g  Sugar (1 1/2 Tbsp)
1 pk Vanilla sugar*
1 c  Plain breadcrumbs
1 1/2 tb Water
3 tb Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
Shape the rolls into dumplings by rubbing the crust of
all sides.  Put these dumplings into a mixture of egg
yolk, milk, lemon peel, and sugar.

Once they have absorbed the liquid all the way
through, gently squeeze out excess liquid by hand.
Whisk the egg white and water, and dip the dumplings
in this mixture, and then roll them in breadcrumbs.
Deep fry in fat until golden brown, then roll in a
mixture of sugar and cinnamon.

Serves 4.

[*Note:  I would probably use 2 tsp of vanilla sugar.
