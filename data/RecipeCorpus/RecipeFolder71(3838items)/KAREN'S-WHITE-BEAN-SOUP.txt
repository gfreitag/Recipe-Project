Title: KAREN'S WHITE BEAN SOUP
Categories: Digest
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb White beans, cooked
1 lg Can tomato sauce
2    Tspps  onion powder
1 ts Garlic powder
2 ts Sage
1 ts Chili powder
All in all, a rave review soup even from "Mr. I Hate
Soup", himself. I often cook my beans in a crock pot,
but when I am in a hurry I use a little multi cooker
pot.  It was sold as a deep fryer, but for obvious
reasons I don't use it that way anymore!! :-)
