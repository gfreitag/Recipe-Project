Title: LAMB PATTIES (USDA)
Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
7 lb Ground lamb
2 c  Fine dry breadcrumbs
6 lg Eggs -- beaten
2 tb Salt
3/4 ts Thyme
1 tb Dry mustard
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
3/4 ts Pepper
ds Garlic powder
Mix ingredients throughly.  Divide mixture into 24 portions, about
1/2 cup each.  Shape into patties.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Place
patties in a shallow baking pan. Bake 30 minutes or until done.

TO FREEZE:  Place six patties at a time in single layer on freezer
wrap. Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Complete wrapping by
pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap together and
fold several times so paper lies directly on top of food. Fold ends
of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer tape. Label with
name of food, date of freezing, and last date the food should be used
for best eating quality (about 4 months).  Freeze immediately for 10
to 12 hours before stacking packages.

TO HEAT FROZEN PATTIES:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Remove
freezer wrap.  Place patties in a shallow baking pan. Bake 45 minutes
or until done.
