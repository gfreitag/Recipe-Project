Title: LOKDOLMAR (STUFFED ONION ROLLS)
Categories: Sweden, Meats, Appetizers, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2    Swedish meatball recipe
3 lg Onions; yellow (1/2 lb ea);
-peeled
3 tb Butter
2 tb Fresh bread crumbs
Place the peeled onions in a 2 or 3 quart pot, add enough cold water
to cover and bring to a boil over moderate heat. Lower the heat and
simmer the onions, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Remove them from the
pot, drain and let cool on a platter while you make the meat stuffing
(see recipe). Pull off each onion layer separately. They should slide
off quite easily. Cut the largest outer layers of the onions in half,
but remember to leave them large enough to enclose the stuffing.
Discard the inner part of the onions (or use them for some other
purpose) if the leaves are too small to stuff. Put a heaping teaspoon
of the meat stuffing in the middle of each onion leaf and enclose it
by folding over the edges of the leaf. At this poinnt they may be
covered with plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days before
cooking. Preheat oven to 400øF. In a shallow flameproof baking dish,
melt 3 tablespoons of butter over low heat. Remove the dish from the
heat and place the onion rolls, sealed side down, side by side in the
butter, first rolling each in the butter to coat it. Bake 15 minutes,
then baste with butter in the dish, sprinkle with bread crumbs and
bake another 15 minutes until the onions are lightly browned and the
crumbs crisp. Lkdolmar may be served as part of a smrgsbord or as
a main dish.
