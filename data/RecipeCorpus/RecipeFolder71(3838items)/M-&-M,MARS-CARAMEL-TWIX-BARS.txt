Categories: Candies
Yield: 40 Servings
35    Kraft caramels, unwrapped
1/4 c  Water
1    Box Nabisco Lorna Doone>>>>
Shortbread cookies (40 pcs.)
2    12 oz bags milk chocolate>>>
Chips.
1) Combine the caramels with the water in a small pan and melt over
low heat. 2) Place the shortbread cookies side by side on an
ungreased cookie sheet. 3) Spoon a dab of caramel onto each cookie.
Then place all the cookies in the 'fridge until the caramel firms up.
4) In the meantime, in a double boiler over low heat, melt the
chocolate chips. You may also use the microwave for melting the
cholocate. 5) Remove cookies from refrigerator. Rest each one on a
fork and dip it into the chocolate. Tap the fork on the side of the
pan or bowl to knock off any excess chocolate. Then place each one on
a sheet of wax paper and let them cool at room temp. This could take
several hours, but bars will set best this way. If you must hurry,
place back in 'fridge for 30 min.

Makes 40 bars.

Variation: Peanut Butter Twix Bars--Substitute 1 cup peanut butter
mixed with 1/2 cup powdered sugar for caramel. Follow rest of
directions exactly.
