Recipe by: Cooking With Bon Appetit - Cookies Preheat oven to 350F.
Using electric mixer, beat butter and 1/3 cup sugar on medium speed 1
minute. Sift together flour and cornstarch.  Add to butter. Blend
until dough is soft, about 1 minute.  Drop by teaspoonfuls onto
ungreased baking sheet. Bake until very lightly browned, about 15
minutes. Transfer cookies to racks to cool.

While cookies are still warm, mound 1/2 teaspoon icing on each; icing
will melt. Cool cookies completely.

Makes about 3 dozen.
