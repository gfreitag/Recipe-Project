Title: MAPLE PECAN SCONES
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 12 Scones
3 c  Flour
1 c  Pecans, chopped
1 1/2 tb Baking powder
3/4 ts Salt
3/4 c  Cold unsalted butter
2/3 c  Maple syrup plus a little
-extra for brushing
1/3 c  Heavy cream
Heat oven to 350'F. Grease and flour a 9-x-13 baking sheet. In a
large bowl stir together the flour, pecans, baking powder, and salt.
Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Set aside.
In another bowl, whisk together the maple syrup and cream. Make a
well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the liquid
mixture, combining with swift strokes until the dough clings
together. Roll out about two inches thick on a lightly flouted
surface. Cut scones with a three-inch round biscuit cutter and place
on baking sheet about two inches apart. Brush tops with additional
maple syrup, and bake for fifteen to twenty minutes or until lightly
browned. Transfer to a rack and cool.
