Title: KORMA
Categories: Indian, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Poultry or meat
1/2 c  Cashews, almonds or mixture
1/2    Inch chopped fresh ginger
1    Clove garlic chopped
2    Green chillies (optional)
1/2 ts Saffron
2 tb Warm milk
1 tb Ghee
2 tb Sunflower or corn oil
1    Medium onion chopped
3 oz Yoghurt
3 oz Cream
1/2 c  Chopped fresh coriander
Salt
Lemon juice (optional)
MMMMM---------------------------SPICES--------------------------------
2    Whole cardamoms
3    Whole cloves
1    Inch cassia bark
1 ts Coriander seeds
1 ts Cummin seeds
1) Cut the meat into 1 inch cubes (the poultry on or
off the bone, to taste) 2) Blend the nuts, ginger,
garlic and chilles into a course paste with 1/4 pint
of water 3) Soak the saffron in warm milk for 10
minutes. 4) Heat the ghee and oil together, then fry
the spices then onion until golden. Add the nut paste
and yoghurt, and cok for 10 minutes or so. 5) Add the
meat, mixing in well. Simmer for about 1 hour or until
the meat is tender. Add water bit by bit if needed. 6)
About 10 minutes before serving, squeeze the saffron
strands in their bowl to get the most colour out of
them then add in, with the milk. Add the cream, fresh
coriander and salt to taste. Garnish with lemon juice
if liked. Notes: 1) Coriander. You may know it as
"cilantro or Chinese parsley" 2) Cassia bark. Similar
to cinnamon but with a sweet musky fragrance. 3) When
frying the spices use a gentle heat as they are easily
burnt!! True kormas are spicy, not hot, and a Moghul
creation. Their special feature is a creamy sauce with
nut and safron. They can be made with chicken (my
favourite), duck, lamb, beef or mutton and should be
served with plain or pullao rice.
