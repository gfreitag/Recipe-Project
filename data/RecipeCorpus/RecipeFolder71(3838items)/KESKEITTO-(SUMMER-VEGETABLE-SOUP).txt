Select the youngest, freshest vegetables that you can
find. Wash, scrape or cut them to the sizes specified
in the ingredient list. Then, except for the spinach,
place all of the vegetables in a 2-3 quart pot, cover
with cold water and add the salt. Boil uncovered for 5
minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Add
spinach and cook another 5 minutes. Remove the pan
from the heat and strain the liquid through a fine
sieve into a bowl. Set the vegetable stock and the
vegetables aside in separate bowls. Melt 2 tablespoons
of butter in the pan over moderate heat. Remove from
the heat and stir in the flour. Slowly pour in the hot
vegetable stock, beating vigorously with a wire whisk
and then beat in the milk. In a small bowl, combine
the egg yolk and cream. Whisk in 1 cup of the hot
soup, 2 tablespoons at a time. Now reverse the process
and slowly whisk the warmed egg yolk and cream mixture
back into the soup. Add the reserved vegetables to the
soup and bring to a simmer. As soon as it comes almost
to a boil, reduce the heat, add the cooked shrimp and
simmer uncovered over low heat for 3 to 5 minutes or
until the shrimp and vegetables are heated through.
Taste and season the soup with white pepper as well as
additional salt if necessary. Pour into a soup tureen
and sprinkle with finely chopped parsley or dill.
