sweets, maple syrup. it cooks down to a delicious candy, but is
delicate, so watch your heat!!-Carol Adkins, President of White Cat
In a heavy saucepan put the maple syrup and butter. Cook to 260 F
on a candy thermometer. Remove from heat and add the vanilla. Stir
well and pour over the popped corn. Shape into balls.

which is better. You may wish to include a few of your favorite" -
