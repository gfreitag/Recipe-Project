Title: LOIN OF PORK IN GREEN CHILI SAUCE
Categories: Meats, Chronicle
Yield: 6 Servings
10    Tomatillos
2 tb Vegetable oil
1/2 lg Onion, finely chopped
2 cl Garlic, chopped
4    Serrano peppers, seeded and
Chopped
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
1 bn Cilantro, stemmed and
Chopped (reserve some sprigs
For garnish
1    (14-oz) jar nopalito (cactus
Pad strips), drained, rinsed
Well and julienned or diced
1 1/2 lb Boneless pork loin, cut into
2-inch cubes
Fresh chilis for garnish
Cut an X on the bottom of each tomatillo and remove core. Drop into
boiling water briefly, 15 to 20 seconds; drain and peel off husks.
(If husks are hard to remove, drop tomatillos again into boiling
water to cover, boiling about 1 minute, or until husks soften).
Quarter tomatillos and place in a blender. Heat oil in a skillet over
medium heat. Add onion and garlic and saute until limp. Add to
blender, along with serranos, salt, pepper, chopped cilantro and
nopalitos. Process until mixture is coarsely ground. Place pork in
heavy pan or Dutch oven; add tomatillo mixture. Bring to a boil,
reduce heat, cover pan and simmer slowly until pork cuts easily with
a fork, about 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Serve garnished with cilantro sprigs
and whole chilis.
