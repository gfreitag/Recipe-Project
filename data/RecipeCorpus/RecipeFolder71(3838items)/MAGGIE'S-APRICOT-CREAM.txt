Title: MAGGIE'S APRICOT CREAM
Categories: Desserts, Vegan
Yield: 2 Servings
175 g  Canned apricots, drained
300 ml Soya milk
Serves 2-3

This unlikely dessert is simplicity and economy incarnate. Looking at
the recipe it is hard to believe ~ but it works. The soya milk turns
to a set cream overnight, and it looks as if you have spent hours
preparing what probably took 3 minutes. A cooling sweet course, with
lovely textures.

Slice the canned apricots and put them into the bottom of a
serving-dish. Pour the milk over them and chill overnight. The soya
milk will set to a light cream, and the natural sugars in the fruit
are sufficient sweetness. Lovely textures!
