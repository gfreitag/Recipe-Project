Recipe by: St. Louis Post-Dispatch 3/24/97 Preheat oven to 300
degrees. Coat a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray or
lightly brush with vegetable oil.

In a food processor, combine cereal and 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar.
Process until fine crumbs form. Place crumb mixture in prepared pan;
tilt and rotate the pan to coat the bottom and sides with crumbs. Tap
the pan on the counter so that the crumbs are evenly distributed. Set
aside.

In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until
smooth. Add 1 1/4 cups sugar, egg yolks, vanilla and salt. Beat until
smooth. With mixer at low speed, gradually add yogurt and flour,
beating until smooth. (Alternately, you can blend all ingredients in
a food processor.)In a large clean mixing bowl and with clean
beaters, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add
remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, whipping until stiff but not dry peaks
form. With a rubber spatula, fold the beaten whites into the cream
cheese mixture.

Turn batter into prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes or until the
cheesecake is puffed and the top is pale golden and dry to the touch.
Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door
closed for 30 minutes. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let
cool completely on a wire rack. Remove the springform pan sides.
Refrigerate, loosely covered with plastic wrap, for at least 4 hours
or up to 2 days.

Shortly before serving, arrange strawberries over the cheesecake.
