Title: MAPLE RICE PUDDING
Categories: Desserts, Low-fat
Yield: 4 Servings
1 qt Skim milk
2 c  Cooked long-grain white rice
1/3 c  Maple syrup; PLUS:
2 tb Maple syrup
1 ts Grated orange rind
1/3 c  Broken walnuts
Combine the milk and rice in a large saucepan.  Cook, stirring, over
medium-low heat until the mixture boils and thickens, about 25
minutes. Stir in 1/3 cup maple syrup and cook 10 minutes more. Add
the orange rind and vanilla.  Pour into 4 (8-ounce) dessert bowls or
custard cups; then allow to cool at room temperature. Meanwhile, heat
the walnuts in a small heavy frying pan over low heat, stirring,
until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons
maple syrup. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until the syrup boils
and coats the walnuts, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle on the puddings.
