Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 16 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
1 kg Kumara
2 tb Cornflour
2 ts Baking powder
2    Eggs
100 ml Milk
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Nutmeg
Olive oil for frying
Because kumara is so moist, baking it before mashing
as this recipe instructs yields the best result. But
it is expensive and inefficient to run an oven to cook
one or two sweet potatoes. If you are not baking
anything else, steam the kumara, dry it well before
mashing and add a little more cornflour if necessary.

Bake 1 kg kumara until tender then mash when the
kumara has cooled a little, sift in 2 tablespoons
cornflour and 2 teaspoons baking powder and mix well.
Add 2 eggs, beaten, 100 ml milk, teaspoon salt, half
teaspoon nutmeg and mix again.

Heat a little olive oil in a frying pan and drop the
mixture into it by the heaped tablespoonful Fry until
browned on both sides.

Makes about 16
