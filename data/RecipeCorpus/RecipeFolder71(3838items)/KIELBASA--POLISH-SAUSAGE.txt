Title: KIELBASA- POLISH SAUSAGE
Categories: Cyberealm, Ethnic, Meats
Yield: 2 Pounds
1 1/2 lb Pork loin or butt
1/2 lb Veal
Salt and pepper
1    Bud of garlic
1 ts Whole mustard seed
3 tb Water
Remove meat from bones, cut into small pieces and run
through a coarse knife of a food grinder. Add 3
tablespoons of water, pound the garlic, and add the
seasoning. Mix very thoroughly and stuff the casings.
The sausage is then ready for smoking. If you don't
have those facilities, you can boil it for 30 minutes
in rapidly boiling water, or you can place the sausage
in a baking dish, cover with cold water, and bake in a
350F oven until the water is absorbed.
