Title: L'AELPLERMAGRONEN DE SUISSE CENTRALE
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 4 Servings
11 oz Whole-grain macaroni or
Rigatoni
11 oz Potatoes in small dice
2 lg Onions, cut in thin circles
1/2 c  Condensed skim milk (or
Extra-strength reconstituted
Dried)
5 oz Grated cheese
Salt, pepper
1. Cook the macaroni and potatoes in a little salted water until just
done (if possible, use soup broth).

2. Soften the onions in your favorite sauteeing liquid.

3. Drain the macaroni mixture and put onto a large platter. Add the
milk and cheese, and mix quickly (the heat of the cooked mixture will
melt the cheese). Grind some pepper on top, and garnish with the
onions.

The [above] recipes are adapted from a flyer which appeared in my
mailbox here in Geneva, called "Live Better - the Magazine for the
Pleasure of a Healthy Life". The originals are not low fat; I have
adapted the ones below to be so, and have translated them from the
French (and also into US units). I have made all three, and they are
all quite good. (I left the original French titles). Enjoy!
