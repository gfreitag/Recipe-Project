Title: KIRSOV'S PUDDING
Categories: Russian, Ethnic, Vegetables, Desserts, Slavic
Yield: 6 Servings
4 ea Lg. sweet potatos
- peeled & grated
1 c  Molasses*
1/2 c  Buttermilk
2 ea Eggs
1/2 c  Melted butter
1/2 ts Salt
* Honey may be substituted for molasses. I had this
dish made both ways. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Grease a 2 qt. baking dish. Beat eggs, add the
molasses or honey, melted butter, & salt. Stir in the
grated sweet potatos. Pour this mixture into the
baking dish. Bake for 2 hours or until the pudding is
a dark, caramel color. Be sure to grate the sweet
potatos just befor eusing them as they will turn dark
and not look as appetizing when cooked.
