1 lg Mashed banana (or 2small)
1/4 c  Unsweetened applesauce
1/4 c  Molasses
1/4 c  Raspberry preserves/jam*
1 c  Soy/rice milk
1/8 c  Brown sugar*

Add to wet ingredients. Mix well. Pour into greased (I used Pam)
muffin tins, bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes.

*original called for 1/4 cup brown sugar. With the raspberry
preserves, I find an 1/8 of a cup plenty. You could also sub
raspberry with any other flavor of jam/preserve I would think. I'm
trying peach next time.

Source: I adapted the muffins from a recipe off a box of bran.
