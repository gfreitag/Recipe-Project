Title: LEMONADE BREAD ABM
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Ounces
MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
2 1/2 ts Yeast
1 7/8 c  Bread flour
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1/2 tb Salt
1 1/2 tb Oil
1/4 c  Lemonade concentrate; thawed
1 c  Water; warm
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Sweet but not cloying and slightly tart, this is good beach food or
porch food.  If you slice and wrap the bread in your beach towel
before you leave home, there will be no paper or plastic wrapper to
add to the trash on the beach.  Just shake out the crumbs before you
dry off.
