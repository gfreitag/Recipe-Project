Categories: Cheese, Main dishes, Pasta, Chicken, Poultry
Yield: 3 Servings
1/2 c  Basil, fresh -- minced
1/4 c  Italian parsley -- coarsely
Chopped
5    Cloves garlic -- minced or
Pressed
3    Roma tomato -- coarsely
Chopped
3/4 c  Romano cheese -- shredded
1/2 lb Linguine
1 lb Boned and skinned chicken
Breast halves
1 lg Japanese eggplant --
Quartered lengthwise
1/3 c  Olive oil
1/2 cn Pitted black olives --
Halved -- optional
4    Green onions -- minced --
Optional
Combine basil, parsley and garlic and set aside.  Cook the pasta al
dente, and set aside in cooking water to stay hot. LIghtly oil and
grill (med heat) chicken and eggplant till chicken is done and
eggplant soft. Cut into bite sized pieces. Drain pasta well and toss
with several drizzles of olive oil, to taste, and cheese. Add garlic
and herbs and toss well. Add chicken, eggplant, tomatoes, olives and
green onions (if used) and toss again. NOTE: This must be done
quickly, so pasta stays hot, and cheese melts. Season to taste with
s&p, and serve with more cheese if desired. I like this with the
olives and green onions, Patty is a purist, and thinks that it
complicates the dish unnecessarily.
