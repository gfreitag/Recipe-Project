Categories: Cookies, Desserts
Yield: 5 Servings
1 c  Butter
1 c  Creamed cottage cheese
2 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Fruit filling (see below)
-----pineapple filling------
1 c  (9 oz can) crushed pineapple
1/3 c  Sugar
1 tb Cornstarch
------apricot filling-------
1 c  Chopped dried apricots
1/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Butter
1/8 ts Cinnamon
These are very simple, but you will find NO better
cookie anywhere! On the down side, they do require
advanced preparation (overnight is best).   Included
are a couple of filling recipes, but a can of pre-made
will work too. (Apricot is best)   When rolling out
dough, try to keep it as chilled as possible. To cream
the cottage cheese, it helps if you have a food
processor or blender, but a fork and a strong arm will
do in a pinch.   Mix ingredients and chill at least 6
hours. Roll to 1/4" thickness. Cut into 2 or 3 inch
squares, and place filling or preserves in center of
square. Bring corners over filling and seal together.
Bake at 350 - 25 to 30 minutes. Remove and dust with
powdered sugar.   Pineapple Filling: Combine
ingredients in sauce pan, cook stirring constantly
until thickened. Cool.   Apricot Filling: Simmer
apricot 10 minutes. Add sugar and simmer 10 minutes
more. Remove from heat and add butter and cinnamon.
Cool.
