Title: MACKEREL IN VINEGAR
Categories: Fish
Yield: 12 Servings
Mackerel
Butter or oil
Large onion
Sugar
Salt and pepper
Malt vinegar
Fillet the mackerel, then dry with a cloth.  Roll the fillets in
flour and fry until golden brown, cool.

Place one layer of fillets in a bowl and sprinkle liberally with salt
and sugar.  Place another layer of mackerel on top and again sprinkle
with salt and sugar. Continue until bowl is full or all fish are used.

Peel and slice a large onion.  Place the raw onion on top of the last
layer of fish.  Sprinkle liberally with pepper. Fill bowl with
vinegar, cover with a lid. Leave for two days then try the vinegar.
If it is not to taste, add more sugar.

Mackerel prepared like this will keep for a considerable time
although not as long as pickled fish.

Note.  If you are not used to buying mackerel, remember that they
MUST be bought fresh.  They do NOT keep well in shop premises.
