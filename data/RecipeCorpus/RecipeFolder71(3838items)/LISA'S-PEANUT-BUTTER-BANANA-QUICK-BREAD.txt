Title: LISA'S PEANUT-BUTTER-BANANA QUICK BREAD
Categories: Breads, Cyberealm
Yield: 4 Sm loaves
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
2    Eggs, beaten
2    Ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 c  Peanut butter
Preheat oven to 325. Coat 4 small loaf pans with vegetable cooking
spray. Combine dry ingredients; blend well and set aside. Combine wet
ingredients; blend well.  Mix together wet and dry ingredients.  Do
not overmix. Distribute batter among the 4 pans, and bake for 30 to
40    minutes.

Notes:  Suprisingly good!

These small loaves freeze well, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, once
completely cooled.  To defrost, set out at room temperature, loosely
wrapped, for about an hour.

These breads are great for making the house smell Autumnal! They also
make great Christmas gifts for the neighbors.
