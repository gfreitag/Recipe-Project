Very light and fresh, this is a wonderful way of treating yogurt or
cream. Simplicity itself, yet a transformation. Serve it with
delicate biscuits of your choice and it is a feast.

Combine the lemon juice, rind and sugar, and the wine if desired.
Chill the mixture until it is very cold. Strain and beat into the
yogurt or cream until completely amalgamated. Spoon into tall glasses
and chill.
