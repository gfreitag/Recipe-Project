pan with nonstick vegetable-oil spray.

To make the macaroon topping: Mix the cream cheese, sugar, egg white,
flour, and coconut extract until smooth. Stir in the flaked coconut.
Set aside.

To make the brownies: In a large bowl, combine the whole-wheat flour,
all-purpose flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and baking powder.

In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy; add the baby-food
prunes, buttermilk, and vanilla. Add the egg white mixture to the
flour mixture and mix until blended. Stir in the chocolate chips and
almonds. Spread the batter in the prepared baking pan.

Spread the macaroon topping over the brownie batter. Bake 25 to 30
minutes. Let cool, in the pan, on a wire rack. Drizzle with the
melted chocolate chips. (Decorative tip: Swirl a toothpick through
the melted chips after drizzling them on the brownies.)
