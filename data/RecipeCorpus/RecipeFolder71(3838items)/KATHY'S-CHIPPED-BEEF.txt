Title: KATHY'S CHIPPED BEEF
Categories: Beef, Breakfast
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Dried beef (I use
Budding's)
2 tb Butter or margarine
2 tb Flour
1 c  Milk*
Salt (it won't need much)
White pepper to taste
1 pn Dry mustard
*(for a more authentic military flavor, use canned
evaporated milk)

Remove the beef from the package, and tear into
shreds. Melt the butter, and briefly saute the beef in
the butter (it should just become slightly crispy).
Add the flour, and stir until the whole mess congeals
slightly and begins to look a little like wet beach
sand (DO NOT brown the flour).

Stir in the milk, and whisk until smooth.  Season to
taste with salt, pepper, and dry mustard.  Simmer
briefly until thickened and all the floury taste is
removed.

Serve over mashed potatoes, rice, biscuits or toast.

NOTE:  For a better, but distinctly non-military
version of this dish, toss in a couple of generous
handfuls of grated cheddar cheese, and a few grains of
cayenne pepper.
