In large mixing bowl combine 1 1/4 cups of the flour

half into 9 balls. Place balls, 3 inches apart, on
greased baking sheets. With fingers, flatten each to 3
1/2-inch circle. Cover; let rise till double (about 45
minutes). Make a depression in center of each ball.
Fill depression with Apricot Filling. Bake at 375 for
10 to 12 minutes. Remove from baking sheets; cool.
Dust lightly with powdered sugar.
