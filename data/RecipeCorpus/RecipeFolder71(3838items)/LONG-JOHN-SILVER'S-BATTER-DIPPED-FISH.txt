Soybean oil is what your local Long John Silver's uses to fry their
fish, and you will best duplicate the real thing by using the same
oil. But any other oil may be substituted. You might want to try
canola oil. It is the oil lowest in saturated fat, and the taste
difference is only slight.
It's crucial that your oil be hot before frying the fish. To
test the temp., drip some batter into the oil. It should bubble
rapidly. After 5 min., the test batter should become golden brown. If
so, fry away, fish fiends.
