Title: LEEKS IN VINAIGRETTE
Categories: France, Vegetables
Yield: 2 Servings
12 md Leek; =or
<dressing>
1/2 c  Olive oil
2 tb Dijon mustard (recipe)
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Ground black pepper
2    Shallots, finely chopped
1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
Trim the root ends from the leeks, leaving the bases intact. Trim
the tops of the leeks to a uniform length. If you are using very
young leeks, the green tops are nice and tender and only 1 inch need
be trimmed. The upper greens of mature leeks tend to be tough and
stringy, and all but 2 or 3 inches should be removed.
Place the leeks on a steamer rack and set over gently boiling water.
Cover and steam the leeks until tender, about 10 minutes for young
leeks, and up to 20 minutes for medium-sized leeks and quartered
large leeks.
While the leeks are steaming, make the dressing. Place the olive oil
in a small bowl.  Add the mustard and beat together until the oil
thickens. Add the vinegar, salt, pepper, and shallots. Set aside.
Arrange the warm leeks on a serving platter.  Pour the dressing
kover them and turn them gently to coat evenly. Sprinkle with the
parsley.
I like the leeks best when they are served slightly warm or at room
temperature, but they may also be made ahead and served chilled.
Serves 4.
