Title: LIGHT BEEF STROGANOFF
Categories: Miamiherald, Meat/beef, Reduced fat
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Canola oil
1 1/2 c  Sliced onions
1/2 lb Mushrooms; sliced
1/2 lb Beef top round, trimmed of
-all visible fat and cut
-into 1/4-inch cubes or
-strips
1 tb Flour
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
1    Bay leaf
1 c  Water
3/4 lb Chopped Roma tomatoes
1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/2 c  Fat-free sour cream
3 c  Cooked wide egg noodles
Heat the oil over low heat in a large nonstick skillet. Cook the
onions slowly for 10 minutes until they brown, stirring occasionally.
Add the mushrooms and cook for 8 minutes longer, covered.
Remove the onions and mushrooms from the skillet, draining as much
oil as possible back into the pan. Add the meat and brown slowly on
all sides, about 6 minutes. Sprinkle the flour, salt and pepper over
the meat, cooking about 1 minute longer to toast the flour.
Add the water and bay leaf and  use a wooden spoon to scrape the
brown bits of meat and onion off the bottom of the pan. The water
will turn dark, about the colour of beef broth. Bring the mixture to
a boil and stir until the liquid thickens slightly.
Add the tomatoes and Worcestershire sauce.  Reduce heat to a simmer,
cover and cook for 30 minutes. While meat is cooking, boil the
noodles according to package directions. When ready to serve, turn
off heat under the meat and stir the fat-free sour cream into the
sauce. Do not return to heat. Serve each portion of meat and sauce
over 1/2c noodles.
