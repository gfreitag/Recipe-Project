** This polish is every bit as effective as the purchased product,
and it should be used sparingly to best effect. Too much polish, wax,
or oil on your furniture will only trap more dust, so work harder to
buff this solution off than to pour it on.

Pour into the clean container of your choice. Close tightly, label
and keep out of the reach of children.

To Use: If you like to spray-and-polish, store this solution in a
pump-type container. If you like to rub your furniture quietly, store
the solution in a squeeze-type container and apply it to an old sock
that you've slipped over your hand, then rub away. In either case,
use only a little bit of the polish at a time and then buff the
surface with a clean cloth or sock. 8 oz

Gift note from me: Include a man's white tube sock with lace and/or a
ribboned bow to use for a cleaning cloth.
