Title: MAKING YOUR OWN DEVONSHIRE OR CLOTTED CREAM
Categories: Misc, British
Yield: 1 Servings  In winter, let fresh, unpasteurized cream stand 12 hours, (in summer,
about 6 hours) in a heat-proof dish. Then put the cream on to heat -
the lower the heat the better. It must never boil, as this will
coagulate the albumen and ruin everything.  When small rings or
undulations form on the surface, the cream is sufficiently scalded.
Remove at once from heat and store in a cold place at least 12 hours.
Then skim the thick, clotted cream and serve it very cold as a
garnish for berries, or spread on scones and top with jam.
