Title: LEMONGRASS CHICKEN
Categories: Thai, Asian, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Frying Chicken
Hacked into serving pieces
--MARINADE--
1/2 c  Lemongrass--See Note
3    Scallion finely mince
Green and white parts
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black Pepper
--STIR-FRY--
2 tb Peanut Oil
2 sm Chili Peppers-small red
2 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Chicken Stock
--GARNISHES--
1/2 c  Peanuts
2 tb Nuoc Mam-Fish sauce
--See Note
2 tb Coriander leaves
NOTES: A. Lemongrass, Remove outer leaves of the lemongrass and finely
slice the tender white part at the base of the stalk. Bruise on the
cutting board with a large morter and pestle or handle of a cleaver,
or a wine bottle. Of course a cuisinart with a 1mm slicer will do the
same thing but sometimes smashing is good. B. Fish Sauce, Nuoc Mam
brand name is Tiparos from Thailand. Fish sauce can be from Vietnam
or Cambodia and should be tasted to determine the saltiness and the
taste. Some of the fish sauce is cloudy and unfiltered, I would avoid
such products. The best fish sauce is tea colored and semi-clear to
coffee colored. METHOD: Mix the chicken pieces with the salt, pepper,
lemongrass and scallions. Set aside for at least 30 minutes, overnite
is better. Heat the Wok, add the oil, when the oil is hot add the
chicken pieces, stir and cook for 3 or more minutes. Add the chili
peppers and stir and cook over medium heat until chicken no longer
looks pink. Season with sugar and more of the black pepper, (or use
white pepper at this step). Add the chicken stock stir for a few more
minutes. GARNISHES: Garnish with Nuoc Mam, Peanuts and Coriander.
