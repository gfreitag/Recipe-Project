Title: KOLACKY
Categories: Diabetic, Desserts, Cookies
Yield: 24 Servings
1/2 c  Butter
3 oz Cream cheese
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Flour
1/8 ts Salt
6 ts 100% fruit spread
1    Eggs
1 ts Water; cold
Use various flavors of fruit spread.

Combine butter and cream cheese in large bowl; beat
until smooth and creamy.  Blend in vanilla.  Combine
flour and salt; gradually add to butter mixture,
mixing until mixture forms soft dough. Divide dough in
half; wrap each half in plastic wrap. Refrigerate
until firm.

Preheat oven to 375.  Roll out half of dough on
lightly floured pastry cloth or board to 1/8"
thickness.  Cut with top of glass or biscuit cutter
into 3" rounds.  Spoon 1/2 ts fruit spread onto center
of each dough circle.  Beat egg with water; lightly
brush onto edges of dough circles. Bring three edges
of dough up over fruit spread; pinch edges together to
seal.  Place on ungreased cookie sheets; brush with
egg mixture. Pepeat with remaining dough and fruit
spread. Bake 12 minutes, until golden brown.

Let stand on cookie sheets 1 minute; transfer to wire
rack. Cool completely.  Store in tightly covered
container.
