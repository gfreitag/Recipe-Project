Title: KD'S 10 MINUTE TOMATO-FREE SAUCE
Categories: Digest, Sept.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/4 c  Soy milk
1 tb Plus 1 Tspn flour ( I use
Whole wheat)
4    To 8 cloves garlic (I am a
Garlic fanatic)
1 pn Basil
1 pn Oregano
1 pn Parsley
1/4 c  Shredded Tofu-Rella Cheddar
Cheese
1/4 c  Shredded Tofu-Rella Jack
Cheese
x  Spike seasoning
1 ts Margarine (optional)
Tofu-Rella cheese can be found at most health food
stores, I buy mine at Trader Joe's or Mothers Market,
which are both California based.

Directions:  Bring soy milk, garlic, basil, oregano,
parsley, spike and margarine (which is optional) to a
rolling boil.  Slowly SIFT the flour while continuing
to stir as the flour will clump. After the flour is
thoroughly disolved stir in the cheese until the sauce
has thickened. If the sauce is not thick enough, add
more cheese, if it is too thick add more soy milk.

This tastes great over pasta, steamed vegetables and
speghetti squash.

For those of you that still eat seafood products,  I
occasionally add imitation crab meat (white fish)
towards the end as to not overcook the fish.

Well, hope you enjoy this recipe!!  Let me know what
you think of it!

Happy eating!
