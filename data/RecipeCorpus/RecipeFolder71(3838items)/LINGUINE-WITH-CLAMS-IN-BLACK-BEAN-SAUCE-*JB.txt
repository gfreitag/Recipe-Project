Categories: Main dish, Shellfish, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Water
30 sm (about 2-inch) hard-shelled
-clams, scrubbed well
2 tb Cornstarch
3 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Scotch
2 tb Rice vinegar
1 tb Sugar

2 1/2 tb Dried fermented black

-drained, and chopped
2 tb Minced garlic
3/4 lb Linguine
2    Scallions, halved lengthwise

-1-inch pieces
*available at Asian markets

In a kettle bring the water to a boil with the clams and steam the
clams, covered, checking them occasionally and transferring them as
they open with a slotted spoon to a large bowl, for 3 to 8 minutes.
Discard any unopened clams, strain the broth through a fine sieve
into a large glass measure, and if necessary add enough water to
measure a total of 1 1/2 cups. Discard the shells, rinse any clams
that feel sandy, and chop the clams.

Stir the cornstarch into the clam broth and stir in the soy sauce, the
Scotch, the vinegar, and the sugar. In a wok or large heavy skillet
heat the oil over moderately high heat until it just begins to smoke
and in it stir-fry the gingerroot, the black beans, and the garlic
for 30 seconds, or until the mixture is fragrant. Stir the cornstarch
mixture, add it to the wok, stirring, and bring the sauce to a boil,
stirring. Simmer the sauce, stirring, for 2 minutes and keep it warm.

In a kettle of salted boiling water cook the linguine until it is al
dente, drain it, and add it to the wok with the clams and the
scallions. Cook the mixture over moderate heat, tossing the linguine,
until it is heated through and the linguine is coated well with the
sauce.
