20 sl Bread, french
1/4 c  Chives; chopped

4 ea Eggs; hard-cooked
Majonez (Mayonnaise) recipe
Paprika, sweet
Spread butter/margarine on 1 side of each thin bread
slice. Sprinkle with chives. Season with salt to
taste. Cut 1/4 inch of both ends of each egg.
Carefully slice each egg crosswise into 5 equal
slices. Place 1 egg slice on each buttered bread
slice. Spoon mayonnaise into a pastry bag fited with a
medium fluted nozzle. Pipe mayonnaise onto egg slices.
Garnish with paprika. Arrange on a platter.
Variation - Place bite-sized pieces of sliced,
peeled cucumber, smoked ham or sausage on mayonnaise
flowers.

DISCLAIMER - The reference mayonnaise recipe uses raw
egg yolks. Given that salmonella is virtually endemic
in North American egg and fryer production, it is
HIGHLY recommended you use a commercially prepared
mayonnaise of good quality as the egg ingredients have
been properly pasteurized prior to use.
