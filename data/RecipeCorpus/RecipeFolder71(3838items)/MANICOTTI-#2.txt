Title: MANICOTTI #2
Categories: Pastas, Italian
Cheese filling
2 lb ricotta cheese
Yield: 8 Servings  :
:
1/2 lb shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 c  grated parmesan cheese
2    eggs
1 ts salt
1 ts parsley flakes
:
:
:
1/8 ts pepper

:    32 oz jar spaghetti sauce
1 lg box manicotti pasta
:

Mix all ingredients for cheese filling thoroughly. Cook manicotti
pasta according to package directions. Drain; handling carefully,
stuff each shell with 1/3-1/2 c. of cheese filling. Cover the bottom
of a 3 quart baking dish with a thin layer of spaghetti sauce. Lay
shells side by side. Pour remaining sauce over stuffed shells.
Sprinkle top with extra parmesan cheese. Bake ate 350 degrees F for
40 minutes or until hot & bubbly. NOTE: I find the manicotti pasta
hard to stuff & use large shell shaped pasta instead.  Walt MM
