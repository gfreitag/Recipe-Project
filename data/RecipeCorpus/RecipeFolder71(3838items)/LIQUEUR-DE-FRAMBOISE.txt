check berries.  Discard any overripe or moldy berries. Place berries
in a large bowl.  Crush berries slightly with back of wooden spoon.
Set aside. Warm 2 cups water with sugar in medium saucepan over
moderate heat. Stir continuously til well dissolved and liquid is
just warm. Pour sugar water over berries, stir.  Cover with plastic
wrap and refrigerate for one week.
Stir occasionally. After aging in refrigerator, strain through a
fine wire mesh strainer into a large bowl or aging container. Add
alcohol mixture, stir. Cap and let age one month. Strain through
cloth until clear. Re-bottle as desired.  Ready for use in cooking at
this point but age 2 months longer before drinking. *Variation: 4
cups 80 proof vodka may be substituted for 2 cups pure grain alcohol
and 2 cups water. Proof of liqueur will be slightly less.
