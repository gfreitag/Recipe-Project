Any good soap can be used to make bubble bath, but castille generally
is preferred. Before the soap can be made into bubble bath it must be
converted to a liquid. To do this,grate 1 bar of castille soap itno 1
qart of water, warm water helps dissolve the soap faster. Allow the
soap and water to mix well so that you have a liquid soap solution.
There are two ingredients that can convert liquid soap into bubble
bath. Tyhese ingredients can be used together or independantly of
each other. An old-fashion way to amke bubble bath is to add
glycerine to liquid soap ( soap shaving and water.) Glycerine has the
ability to make bubbles and increase suds. Coconut oil is often used
as a substitute for glycerine, which is usually much higher priced.
Coconut oil is very effective at creating lather. Both glycerine and
coconut oil are known for their special skin-softeneing properties.
