Recipe by: Jo Merrill Normally served as a breakfast dish, machaca has
become accepted as a main course for dinner or lunch as well.

* Original recipes calls for lard but you can use corn or safflower
oil. Cut the beef into small cubes. Place in a large saucepan with
salted water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to simmer. Cook,
partially covered, until the meat is tender, about 1 hour. Cool the
meat slightly in its broth, then drain and shred with a fork. In a
large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of lard (or oil).  Add the onion
and cook and stir until it is transparent.  Add chilies and tomatoes
and cook over medium heat 2-3 minutes.  Add salt to taste. In another
large skillet, heat the remaining lard or oil almost to the smoking
point. Add the shredded beef and cook and stir until lightly browned.
Add the chili-tomato mixture. Stir in the beaten eggs, continuing to
stir until they are just set. Serve at once. From Flavors of Mexico
