Title: LA PARILLA TAQUERIA GUACAMOLE
Categories: Dips, Mexican
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Jalapeno chile with seeds --
Finely minced
3 tb Fresh cilantro -- coarsely
Chopped
1    Ripe avocado -- peeled and
Pitted
1/4 ts Kosher salt
1 c  Water
3 tb White onions -- diced
This is the version of guacamole you often see in little taquerias in
Mexico. The spicy, thin mixture has a great smooth flavor. But the
reason you see it used so often is that it is much less expensive
than the famous chunky guacamole, an advantage in tiny restaurants
where tacos commonly cost less than the equivalent of thirty cents.
It is so good, however, that I use it even when the difference in
cost is no object.

Put all the ingredients except the onion in a food processor and blend
until very smooth. Pour into a bowl and stir in the onion. Use
immediately.

Makes about 2 cups.
