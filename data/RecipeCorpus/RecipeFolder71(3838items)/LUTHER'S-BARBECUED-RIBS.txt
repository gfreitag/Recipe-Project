Categories: Bbq sauces, Pork
Yield: 6 Servings
5 lb Spareribs
MMMMM-------------------FLORIDA BARBECUE SAUCE------------------------
2 c  Margarine or butter
1 c  Cider vinegar
1 c  Catsup
6 oz Jar Prepared horseradish
6    Limes or lemons (the juice)
1 ts Salt
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 ts Hot pepper sauce
PREPARE FLORIDA BARBECUE SAUCE: In a medium stainless-steel or
enamelware saucepan melt margarine or butter slowly. Add vinegar,
catsup, horseradish, lime or lemon juice, salt and Worcestershire and
pepper sauces. Simmer uncovered 20 to 25 minutes to blend flavors.
Use as basting sauce for pork, chicken or other meats and serve as a
table sauce. Leftover sauce can be refrigerated and kept up to a
week. NOTE: If using this sauce for chicken, lemons are better than
limes; limes give a pleasant tang to pork and other meats.
DIRECTIONS: Place ribs about 6 inches above hot coals. Brush lightly
with sauce and brown on one side. Keep a water bottle handy when
using this sauce as it causes flames to shoot up. Turn, brush again
with sauce, and brown the other side.  Continue turning and basting
every 10 minutes until ribs are done, about 1 hour. Check by cutting
near bone in a center section.  If juices run clear or golden the
ribs are done. Remove ribs to a platter. Cut into 1- to 3-rib
sections and serve with any remaining sauce.
