3. Trim fat from pork. Place pork on a broiler pan coated with cooking
spray. Combine mustart, 2 tablespoons syrup, rosemary, salt, and
pepper in a small bowl; brush over pork. Insert meat thermometer into
thickest part of one tenderloin. (I use an instant read thermometer
and wait until about 20 minutes into the cooking to check temp.)

until hot. Add apples, and saute 5 minutes or until lightly browned.
Reduce heat to low, and add 4 tablespoons maple syrup. Simmer 10
minutes or util apples are tender, stirring occasionally. Cut port
crosswise into slices; spoon cooked apples over pork.
