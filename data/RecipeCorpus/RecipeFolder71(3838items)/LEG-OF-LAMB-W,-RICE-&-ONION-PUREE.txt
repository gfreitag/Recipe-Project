Title: LEG OF LAMB W/ RICE & ONION PUREE
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Bone-in leg of spring lamb
5    Garlic cloves; peeled,
- cut into 1/4-in slivers
2 tb Olive oil
10 md Onions; finely sliced
1/2 tb Chopped fresh thyme leaves
-=OR=-
1 ts -Dried thyme
1/2 tb Salt; or as desired
White pepper
2 c  Cooked rice
1/2 c  Whipping cream
1 ts Nutmeg, freshly ground
PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Trim excess fat from the outside of the leg,
leaving only a thin layer. Using a small knife, poke holes in the
meat and stuff in slivers of garlic. Rub the surface of the lamb with
olive oil. Mound onions and thyme in the middle of a roasting pan.
Sprinkle the lamb with salt and pepper and place it, fat side down,
on the onions. Place in the oven, reduce heat to 350F and roast 1
hour. Turn the lamb fat side up and return to the oven. Roast another
20-to-30 minutes for medium-rare or about 20 minutes per pound. A
meat thermometer should read 145F for medium rare. Remove the pan
from the oven and place the lamb on a cutting board. Let rest 15
minutes before carving. Scrape the onions into a food processor, add
the rice, cream, nutmeg and desired salt, and pulse, scraping down
the sides of the bowl, until a lumpy smooth puree is attained. When
it's time to serve dinner, transfer the puree to a vegetable dish.
Slice the lamb and arrange on a meat platter.
