Title: KHEER (SWEET RICE)
Categories: Desserts, Indian
Yield: 1 Batch
1/3 c  Rice, short or medium grain
10 c  Milk
1/4 ts Ground cardamom
1    Bay leaf
1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Almonds, sliced; lightly
-toasted (opt)
[Yes, these proportions *are* right, only 1/3 cup
uncooked rice to 10 cups milk.]

Wash the rice and set it aside to drain.  In a tall
pot that can hold at least twice the volume of the
milk, bring the milk to a boil; then adjust the heat
so the milk is always rising and frothing, but not
bubbling over. To minimize the cooking time, let the
milk boil vigorously, uncovered, for the first 15
minutes, while you stir it rhythmically with a wooden
spatula to prevent the thick milk on the bottom of the
post from scorching.

Drop the rice into the milk along with the bay leaf.
Continue stirring. Keep over medium-high heat and stir
very carefully for another 20 minutes until the rice
breaks up and rolls with the milk. By now the milk
should be reduced to two thirds of its original
volume. Stir in the sugar, cardamom, and almonds.
Cook for 5 more minutes and remove from the heat.
Sweet rice should be only slightly thick when removed
from the heat, because it will thicken when
refrigerated. Chill well before serving.

For other classic flavours, replace the cardamom with
a teaspoon of rose water and a few pinches of saffron
powder.
