"These delicious popovers take advantage of lemon's strong affinity
with freshly ground black pepper. They rise best in baked in deep
molds in a very hot oven. One of the best ways to grate lemon peel is
to remove the zest in strips using a vegetable peeler, then grind it
to a powder in a spice mill."

Preheat oven to 450F. Sift the flour into a mixing bowl and gradually
whisk in the milk. Add the remaining ingredients, whisking just to
mix. The mixture should be the consistency of heavy cream. If
necessary, add more milk. Grease popover molds or muffin cups with
vegetable oil spray or a little olive oil. Fill each mold 1/2 full.
Bake for 15 minutes without opening the door. Reduce heat to 375F and
continue baking for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the popovers are
browned. Unmold and serve at once.
