Title: KIFLIES BY HELEN
Categories: Cookies, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
12    Eggs separated-save whites
6 c  Flour-not sifted
1/4 c  Lemon Rind (very fine)
1 1/2 pk Powder Sugar (2 boxes) *
1 lb Butter
1/2 pt Sour Cream
3 lb Grated Nuts *
24    Egg Whites (or more) *
Make into small balls (tablespoone size), place in
refrigerator overnight. Roll out to the size of a
saucer and fill with filling (*). Bake at 350 degrees
for 10-12 minutes.

The less handing the flakier the Kiflies are. I
cut my butter into the flour, by rubbing it between by
hands. Mix or cream egg yolks and lemon rind,
together. Then add to flour, and mix until all is
blended. Then make into balls.
