Title: LAMB HASH & POACHED EGGS
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Butter
2    Celery stalks; finely diced
1 md Onion; finely diced
2 tb Flour
1 c  Finely minced cooked lamb
2 md Potatoes
1/2 ts Salt
Ground black pepper
12    Poached eggs
MELT 2 TABLESPOONS BUTTER in a small saucepan over medium heat, add
the celery and onion and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes.
Sprinkle with flour, and cook, stirring constantly, another minute.
Remove from heat and scrape mixture into a mixing bowl to cool. Add
the lamb. Wash the potatoes but don't peel them. Shred them on the
shredding blade of a food processor, or coarsely grate them by hand.
Add the potatoes to the bowl and mix well. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. Melt 1 teaspoon of butter in a 6-inch non-stick frying
pan over medium heat. Add about 3/4- to 1-cup of the hash mixture, or
about a 2-inch thickness. Cook without stirring or moving the hash
for 3 minutes. Flip the hash, which will have formed into a patty.
Reduce heat to low and continue to cook another 5 minutes. Repeat
with the remaining mixture. As each hash patty is done, transfer to
the oven and keep warm. To serve the hash, place 2 poached eggs on
each serving.
