Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 3/4 c  Flour
2 tb Powdered sugar
1/2 c  Margarine or butter
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Flour
1/4 t  Salt
6    Egg yolks
1 c  Heavy cream
4 c  Sliced rhubarb
1 c  Sliced strawberries
1/2 t  Lemon juice
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
6    Egg whites
1/2 c  Sugar
To make the crust, mix the flour and sugar together. Cut in the
margarine or butter. Press into a lightly greased 9 X 13-inch pan.
Bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 10 to 12 minutes, until golden.
Remove and let cool while you prepare the filling. Toss the sugar,
flour, and salt together.  Lightly beat the egg yolks and cream
together, then stir into the sugar mixture.  Fold in the rhubarb,
strawberries, and lemon juice. Spread over the baked crust and bake
at 350 F for 1 hour, until firm. Beat the egg whites until foamy.
Beat in the sugar, 1 Tablespoon at a time, until stiff peaks form.
Spread this meringue over the rhubarb mixture and return to the oven
10 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned. Cool and then cut into
squares. Serves 8 to 10.

NOTE:  These "bars" are more like tarts with a custard-fruit filling
and a meringue topping than they are like old-fashioned cookie bars.
They make a fine dessert, best served fresh.
