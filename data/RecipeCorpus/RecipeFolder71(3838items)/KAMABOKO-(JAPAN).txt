I was browsing through my book on Asian foods
today++nothing in surimi as such, but here's what it
says about Kameboko which is very similar, if not the
same thing...  I suspect the process for making surimi
is much the same.

Firm, slightly rubbery-textured cakes of ground fish
are a popular ingredient in Japanese cooking.  They
are added to soups, simmered dishes and noodles and
are served as hors d'oeuvre.  The name comes from an
ancient word for the "cattail" reed.  Fish is pureed,
bound with a starch-usually kuzu, arrowroot or potato
formed into blocks and steamed.

Sometimes food color-most often pink-red, but
occasionally green, yellow or brown-is brushed over
the top to give an attractive slice when cut.

It is sold in vacuum-sealed packs that should be
refrigerated and used within one week.  To use, slice
kamaboko and add in final stages of cooking, as it
needs only to be heated.
