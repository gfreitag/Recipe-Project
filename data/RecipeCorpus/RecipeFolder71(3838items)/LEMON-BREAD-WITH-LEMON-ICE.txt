MMMMM-------------------------LEMON ICE------------------------------
2 c  Water
1 c  Sugar
2 tb Grated lemon rind

2    Egg whites (opt)
Grease and flour a 9x5 loaf pan for each loaf of bread you are making.
Combine sugar, milk, butter, and eggs; mix well. Blend in flour,
baking powder, salt and grated lemon rind. Turn mixture into pan and
bake 1 hour in preheated 350-degree oven.  Cool slightly, remove from
pan, and set on foil.

Meanwhile, prepare glaze.  Combine sugar and lemon juice in sauce
pan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves and glaze is hot.

Pour hot glaze slowly over surface of bread.  Let bread cool
completely before slicing.

To prepare Lemon Ice, combine water and sugar in a saucepan. Add rind
and bring to a boil.  Simmer 5 minutes. Let cool. Add lemon juice and
stir. Pour liquid into freezer trays (two for each loaf of bread) and
freeze until set, but not hard. Place in food processor or blender.
If desired, add egg whites (they will make the ice smooth and white),
and beat until smooth. Refreeze for about 3 hours or until firm. When
ready to serve, let stand for a few minutes before scooping out.

Serve bread slices with a scoop of lemon ice on the side.
