Discard fat from the top of the can of chicken broth. Heat a very
large stockpot. (If you do not have a very large stockpot, you can
divide the ingredients and make the stock in two stockpots.) Remove
from the heat and spray twice with vegetable oil spray. Toss in the
onion and carrot, lower the heat and cover the opt. Cook, stirring
frequently, over Medium-High, add the chicken and cook until the
chicken flesh is browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Pour in the
chicken broth an water. Add the celery and bay leaves, and bring to a
boi. Boil for 5 minutes. As foam accumulates, skim it off and
discard. Lower the heat to simmer and add the thyme. Simmer, covered
for 2 hours. Add water as necessary to keep the chicken covered with
liquid. Remove the pot from the heat. Remove the chicken and allow to
cool, then pick the meat from the bones and reserve for another use.
Strain the stock and discard the vegetables and bay leaves. Cool to
room temperature. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Lift any congealed
fat from the stock and discard. Stor for 2-3 days in the refrigerator
or freeze for longer storage.=

Makes 20-24 cups.
