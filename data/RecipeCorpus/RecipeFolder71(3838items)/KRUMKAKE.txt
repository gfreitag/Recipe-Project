Yield: 28 Servings
3    Eggs
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Butter
1 ts Vanilla extract OR
1/2 ts Almond extract
ds Ground nutmeg
In a medium mixing bowl beat eggs with an electric
mixer on medium speed about 1 minute.  Add sugar; beat
about 3 minutes or till sugar is almost dissolved.
Melt butter; cool slightly.  Stir butter into egg
mixture.  Add flour, vanilla or almond extract, and
nutmeg; stir just till smooth.
Heat a Krumkake iron on the range-top over
medium-low heat.  For a 6-inch iron, spoon about 1
Tablespoon of the batter onto the hot, ungreased iron.
Close gently but firmly.  Cook over medium-low heat
about 30 seconds or till light golden brown.  Turn
iron and cook about 30 seconds more.  Open the iron
carefully.  Loosen cookie with a narrow spatula;
invert onto a wire rack.  Immediately roll the cookie
into a cone or cylinder; using a wooden or metal form.
Let cool around the cone or cylinder till the cookie
holds its shape.
Reheat the iron and repeat with remaining batter.
Cool rolled cookies on a wire rack.  If desired,
before serving, pipe or fill with whipped cream; top
with chopped almonds or chocolate-flavored sprinkles,
or serve with preserves if desired.  Makes 26-30
cookies.
