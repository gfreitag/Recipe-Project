Recipe by: The Woman's Day Cookbook 1. Heat the oven to 350F. Lightly
grease a shallow baking dish large enough to hold the fish in a single
layer.

2.  Season the fish on both sides with salt and pepper. Place in the
prepared dish.  Arrange the lemon slices over the fillets, sprinkle
with scallion, then top with the sage. Dot with butter. Pour the
broth into the dish.

3.  Bake the fish, basting occasionally with the pan juices, for 10-12
minutes, or just until opaque at its thickest part when tested with a
fork.

4.  Transfer the fish to serving plates, spoon some of the pan juices
over the fish, and serve right away.
