Title: LEGAL'S INAUGRAL FISH CHOWDER
Categories: Fish, Soups
Yield: 3 Servings
1/2 c  Butter
3 c  Diced onions
1/4 c  Finely grated carrots
2 ts Minced garlic
1/2 c  Flour
12 c  Concentrated fish stock
4 lb Chowder fish fillets, such
-as 2 lbs. cod, 1 lb.
-monkfish and
1 lb Cusk (note from Al: I
-believe any firm white fish
-will do)
2 c  Light cream
1/2 c  Finely grated Monterey Jack
-cheese
salt freshly ground black pepper

Heat the butter in a large saucepan until softened, and saute the
onions, carrots and garlic in it, stirring frequently, for about 5
minutes. Remove from heat and slowly stir in the flour. Return to the
heat, and cook, stirring, for about 4 minutes. Meanwhile, begin
heating the stock in a large pot. Whisk the stock into the flour
mixture. Bring the stock to a boil, whisking constantly, then reduce
the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.

Add the fish and simmer about 10 minutes longer.  Stir in the cream
and cheese, and simmer until the cheese melts, about 5 to 8 minutes.
(You won't distinguish the cheese as such, it is incorporated in the
chowder.) Reheat the chowder slowly so the cream doesn't boil.

Makes about 3 quarts.
