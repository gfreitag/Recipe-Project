In a medium-sized bowl combine vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil
and red pepper; mix to combine. Add the diced tofu, and tip the bowl
in each direction to allow all the tofu to come into contact with the
marinade. Cover, and let marinate for at least an hour.

Prepare the onion, celery, carrot, and bamboo shoots and place these
together in a bowl. Set aside.

In a separate bowl combine peas, garlic, scallions and zucchini; set
aside.

About 15 minutes before serving time, place the cornstarch in a small
bowl. Drain the marinade from the tofu into the bowl. Whisk this
mixture until the cornstarch dissolves. Set aside, leaving the whisk
in the bowl.

Heat a medium-sized wok. Add 2 tb. peanut oil or sesame oil. When it
is hot, add the bowlful of onions, celery, etc. and the salt, and
stir-fry over high heat for about 5 minutes.

Add the second bowlful of vegetables (peas, garlic, etc.) and stir-fry
another 2 to 3 minutes, keeping the heat high.

Add the drained tofu. Stir-fry another 3 to 5 minutes--until all the
vegetables are *just* tender.

Whisk the cornstarch mixture from the bottom and pour it in. Stir-fry
several more minutes, then add the peanuts. Serve immediately, over
rice.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
