Title: KEY LIME COCONUT COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Desserts
Yield: 30 Cookies
1 c  Sweetened condensed milk
4 tb Key lime juice
4 tb All-purpose flour
2 c  Unsweetened coconut flakes
4 tb Sugar
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease 2 baking sheets.

Combine the condensed milk, Key lime juice, and flour
in a medium bowl. Stir in the grated coconut and then
the sugar.  If using sweetened coconut, taste the
mixture before adding the sugar.  Add the sugar only
if you think it is necessary.  The cookie should have
a tangy flavor from the Key lime juice.  Drop
teaspoons of the mixture onto a baking sheet, leaving
2 inches between each cookie; they will spread while
baking. Bake for 25 minutes until they just start to
turn golden. Remove from the pan to a rack to cool.
Store in an airtight container.
