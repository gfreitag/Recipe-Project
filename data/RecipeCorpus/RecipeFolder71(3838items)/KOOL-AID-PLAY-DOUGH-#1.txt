Categories: Kids, Play dough, Crafts
Yield: 1 Batch
MMMMM-------------------LISA CRAWLEY/TEASPOON------------------------
2 pk Non-sweetened Kool-Aid
2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Salt
2 ts Alum
2 c  Water; boiled
3 tb Oil
Mix the Kool-Aid, flour, salt and alum together.  Add
the water and oil. Knead. Add more flour if needed to
reduce stickiness. NOTE: I consulted a pre-school
director about this recipe. She uses it, says the kids
love it, it's not sticky and it SMELLS GOOD!
