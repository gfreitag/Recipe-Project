Everybody knows how to make guacamole, right? Wrong. Please, no lime
or lemon, no sour cream. This recipe makes what is probably the most
commonly made guacamole in Mexico. It is very rich and buttery, and
is so simple to make, it can be done at the last minute. We make
guacamole to order at Cafe Marimba, adding a little cilantro and
roasted tomato, and we serve it right in the molcajete in which it is
made.

Quickly mash the avocados and chiles together and season with salt.
Guacamole should be chunky. Taste for seasoning and serve immediately.

Makes about 1 cup.
