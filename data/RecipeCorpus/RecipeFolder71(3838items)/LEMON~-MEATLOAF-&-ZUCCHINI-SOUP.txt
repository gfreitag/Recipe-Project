Title: LEMON~ MEATLOAF & ZUCCHINI SOUP
Categories: Meatloaf, Soup
Yield: 2 Servings
2 ts Olive oil
1/4 c  Chopped onion
2 c  Low sodium chicken broth
1/2 ts Dried oregano
1 tb Lemon
1/4 c  Instant rice
1 sm Zucchini -- thinly sliced
Pepper
1 sl Leftover meatloaf
Chop 1/4 section of a medium, yellow, onion.  Heat the oil and cook
the onion until soft and just beginning to brown, about 8 minutes,
maximum. Add 2 to 2-1/2 cups of canned chicken broth (reduced sodium
and/or reduced fat). Add the oregano, rubbing it between the palms as
you add it. Remove the rind from a lemon wedge (1/8th whole) and add
that. Add the ('ready in 5-minutes' kind of...) rice. Simmer about 5
minutes, stirring (rice will be a little under done); taste and
adjust lemon, oregano, pepper, if needed. Add zucchini, separating
slices as you add. Simmer about 2 minutes. Cut leftover meatloaf into
bite-sized pieces and add that. Warm through. Serve with a multigrain
oat bran bread.
