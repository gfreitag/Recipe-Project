IN A DUTCH OVEN or 3-quart heavy pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil
over high heat on top of the stove. Add the lamb in batches and brown
well on all sides. Do not crowd the pot or the meat will steam rather
than brown. Remove and reserve as pieces become brown. Discard fat.
Preheat oven to 350F. When all the meat has browned, lower heat to
low, add 2 tablespoons oil and add the celery, carrot and garlic.
Cook, stirring, 1 minute. Return the meat to the pot. Add the stock
and beans. Bring to a boil, add the marjoram or oregano, cover, and
bake 1 1/2 hours, or until the lamb is cooked and the beans are
tender. Meanwhile, using a small paring knife, cut off tip and stem
of the tomatoes. Remove the seeds and core, leaving only firm, outer
pulp. Slice one side of each tomato and lay it flat on work surface.
Cut into 1/4-inch lengthwise strips, pile up strips and cut across
into 1/4-inch pieces. Reserve on a plate until needed. Add the
macaroni to the casserole, replace in oven, and cook, covered,
another 20 minutes, or until pasta is tender. Remove the fresh herb
sprigs and add the tomatoes. Transfer to a large tureen or divide
among individual soup bowls. Offer grated cheese, minced onions,
ground pepper and olive oil as garnishes at the table.
