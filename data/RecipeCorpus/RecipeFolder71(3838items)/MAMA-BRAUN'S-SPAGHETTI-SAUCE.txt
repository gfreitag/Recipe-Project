Beau's notes:

*  This sauce is patterned after that of a Syro-American restaurateur
of Ocala whose restaurant, The Blue Bird, no longer exists. However,
the spaghetti sauce recipe, one Mama (after trying at first more or
less to duplicate the Blue Bird's) refined, is immortal. Because of
the vegetables used in it, the family tradition has been to make a
meal of spaghetti with the sauce alone. The basic sauce is useful
also for lasagna and other pasta dishes.

*  Mom uses juices from beef roasted with sherry and "gunk" for beef
stock.

*  The family is still  boycotting Hunt's anything!
