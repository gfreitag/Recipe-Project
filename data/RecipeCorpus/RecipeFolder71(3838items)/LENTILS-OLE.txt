Title: LENTILS OLE
Categories: Mexico
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Lentils
3 c  Water
1/2 c  Chopped scallions (green &
White parts), or onion
(either is good)
1/2 c  Green peppers, diced
1/2 c  Red peppers, diced
1 tb Chili powder (adjust to
Taste, esp. if you use spicy
Chili powder)
1/2 ts Cumin seeds, crushed (what I
Use) or 1 tsp ground cumin
4    Cloves minced garlic
1    To 2 TBSP red wine vinegar
1    8 oz can tomato sauce
1 tb Molasses
Bring the lentils and water to a boil, then cover & simmer for about
25 - 30 minutes until soft but not mushy. While the lentils cook,
saute the scallions, pepppers, garlic, chili powder and cumin in 1
TBSP vinegar til the vegetables are limp (about 2 mins). (NB: I do
use a nonstick pan for this step.) Add tomato sauce and molasses,
cook for 1 minute (scrape the stuck pieces off the pan), taste and
add more vinegar if needed (I usually add another TBSP). Add mixture
to lentils and cook until heated through.

Great over rice, or maybe as a burrito or taco filling (recommend
using less than 3c. water then, since this comes out very sauce-y).
