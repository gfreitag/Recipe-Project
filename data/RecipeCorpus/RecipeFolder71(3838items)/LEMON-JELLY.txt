Title: LEMON JELLY
Categories: None
Yield: 2 Pints
12    LEMONS
4 lg APPLES (tart--Granny Smith)
Water To cover
3 c  GRANULATED SUGAR
Slice the lemons, including the rind, seeds and all, thin, and place
into a saucepan.

Core the apples, but do not peel, and chop coarsely. Add the apples
to the pan and pour in enough water to just cover the fruit. Cook
over moderate heat, until the fruit becomes mushy.

Pour the mixture into a jelly bag or a colander lined with several
thicknesses of damp cheesecloth and let drip into a bowl for about an
hour. Using a spoon, force as much liquid through the cheesecloth as
possible.

Measure the juice; you should have about 4 cups. For each cup of
juice, add 3/4 cup of sugar.

Return to the pan and boil for another 15 minutes or so, until the
mixture reaches the jelly stage, about 220- to 225-degrees F on a
candy thermometer. To be absolutely certain, place a tablespoon of
the hot mixture into a saucer and set it in the freezer for a few
minutes. If it jells, the mixture is ready.

Pour the jelly into HOT, sterilized jars and seal.

Process in boiling water bath for 10 minutes. Or it may be store in a
covered container in the refrigerator for several months.
