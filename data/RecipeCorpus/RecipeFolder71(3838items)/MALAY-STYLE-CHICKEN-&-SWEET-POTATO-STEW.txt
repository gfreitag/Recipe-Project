Title: MALAY-STYLE CHICKEN & SWEET POTATO STEW
Categories: None
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Cayenne pepper
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Ground cloves
2    2 1/2-pound chickens, each
-cut into 8 pieces
1/2 c  Vegetable oil, approximately
2 lg Yellow onions, thinly sliced
3 tb Minced ginger
2 tb Minced garlic
5 tb Prepared curry powder
2 tb Minced fresh red or green
-chili pepper of your choice
2 qt Chicken stock (see note)
4    Sweet potatoes, cut into
-large chunks
1 c  Unsweetened coconut milk
1/4 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
1. In a small bowl, combine the flour, cayenne, cinnamon and cloves
and mix well.

2. Dredge the chicken pieces in the spiced flour. In a large, wide
stockpot, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not
smoking. Add the chicken pieces in a single layer, being careful not
to crowd the pan-work in batches if necessary. Cook until well
browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. As the chicken is browned, remove
to a platter.

3. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions, and cook until they just
begin to color, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger, garlic, curry
powder, and chili and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute more.
Add the stock, the browned chicken and the sweet potatoes, return to
a simmer and cook for about an hour, covered, until a peek inside one
of the pieces of chicken shows that it is cooked through.

4. Add the coconut milk and continue to cook for 1 minute. Remove
from the heat, add cilantro and serve.

Tribune test kitchen note: We used only 1 quart of stock and believe
that the stated amount would make an unacceptably thin stew.
