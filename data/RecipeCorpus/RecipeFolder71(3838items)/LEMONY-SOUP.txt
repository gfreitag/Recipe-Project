Title: LEMONY SOUP
Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 6 Servings
2    Onions, chopped
3    Stalks of celery, chopped
1    Sweet red pepper, chopped
6 c  Veggie boullion
1 ts Turmeric
1 ts Ground coriander
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Cayenne
1    Potato, chopped
2    Carrots, chopped
1 cn (28-oz.) tomatoes, chopped
1    Zucchini, chopped
1 c  Coiled vermicelli or Chinese
Noodles, crumbled
1 cn Chickpeas, undrained, or 2
c  Cooked chickpeas
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1/4 c  Italian parsley, chopped
2 tb Mint leaves, chopped
Freshly ground black pepper
Bring onion, celery, red pepper, and 1/2 c. of the boullion to a boil
in a large pot.  Simmer about 10 minutes to soften the veggies. Add
the remaining boullion, spices, potato, carrots, and tomatoes; simmer
20 minutes.  Stir in zucchini, noodles, chickpeas, and lemon juice,
and cook 5 minutes. Garnish with parsley, mint and pepper before
serving. 6-8 servings.

NOTE:  When I made this, I left out the noodles.  I've never had
"real" harira before so I can't vouch for the authenticity.

The next time I make this, I might leave out the tumeric. It turned
the chickpeas and the potatoes an unnatural shade of yellow, IMHO.
