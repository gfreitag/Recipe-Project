Title: KOREAN GRILLED BEEF
Categories: Beef
Yield: 1 Servings
3 ea Green onions, finely chopped
4 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
5 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Sesame oil
1 tb Sesame seeds
1/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Sherry or mirin (rice wine)
1/8 ts Black pepper
Slice the steak diagonally against the grain into very
thin strips. Score each piece lightly. (This prevents
meat from curling as it is grilling). Combine
remaining ingredients in bowl, mix well, then add
meat. Allow to marinate for several hours or overnight.

To prevent overcooking, grill meat just until it turns
color, then remove from heat.  Remember, all meat
continue to cook even when taken off heat. Serve with
rice.
