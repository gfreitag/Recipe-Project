Categories: Beverages, British, Holiday

2 tb Sugar, brown; up to 1/2 cup
2 qt Cider, sweet; or hard cider

1/8 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Ginger; ground
Roast the apples in a baking pan at 450F for about an hour, or until
they are very soft and begin to burst. (An alternative - and quicker-
procedure is to peel and boil the apples until they are very soft and
flaky.) You may leave the apples whole, or break them up. In a large
saucepan, dissolve the sugar a few tablespoons at a time in the cider
or ale , tasting for sweetness. Add the spices. Bring to a boil and
simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the liquid over the apples in a
large punch bowl, or serve in a large heat resistant mugs. MAKES: 8 1
cup servings Note: Nuts make a nice accompaniment to Lamb's Wool
(they were originally roasted in with the apples.)
