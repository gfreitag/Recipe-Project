Categories: Cookies
1/2 c  sliced almonds
Yield: 30 Servings
1/2 c  unsalted butter -- room
temperature
:
1/2 c  dark brown sugar
1    egg
1    egg yolk
1/2 ts almond extract
1 3/4 c  flour
1 1/2 ts cinnamon
1/2 ts salt
1 TB lemon peel -- finely grated
1/3 c  cherry jam

1.  Grind the almonds until almost a powder in a food processor. Set
aside. 2. In the large bowl of an electric mixer beat the butter
until creamy. Add the brown sugar and beat until completely blended,
about 1 minute. Beat in the egg, egg yolk and almond extract. 3. Sift
together the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Slowly add to the
creamed mixture in 3 additions, beating well after each addition,
until completely blended. Scrape down the sides of the bowl
occasionally. Blend in the almonds and lemon peel by hand. The dough
will feel sticky; let stand 10 minutes before using. 4. Shape the
dough into balls that are slightly smaller than 1 inch, as this dough
will spread. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Make an indentation in
the center of each with your thumb and fill with about 1/4 teaspoon
of the cherry jam. 5. Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven 12 minutes.
Let cool a few minutes before removing to wire racks.
