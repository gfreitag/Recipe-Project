Title: LAYERED CUSTARD BARS
Categories: Candies, Low-cal
Yield: 12 Servings
1 c  Flour
1/8 ts Salt
8 tb Butter; cold
2 tb Liqueur, almond
16 oz Peaches, canned, no sugar
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Pourable fruit, peach
1 tb Butter; nelted
1/4 c  Almonds, sliced
1/4 ts Cinnamon, ground
For pourable fruit, you may substitute 6 tb peach fruit spread
combined with 2 tb warm water. If almond liqueur is unavailable, you
may substitute 2 tb apple juice concentrate AND 1/2 ts almond
extract. Preheat oven to 350.  Combine flour and salt in medium bowl.
Cut in butter with pastry blender or two knives until mixture
resembles coarse crumbs. Add liqueur; mix well. Press dough evenly
onto bottom of 8" square baking pan. Bake 15 minutes, until set.
Arrange peaches evenly over partially baked crust; if using fruit
halves, cut into slices first. Combine eggs and pourable fruit; mix
until well blended.  Pour evenly over peaches; set aside. Melt
butter; add almonds and cinnamon and mix lightly. Sprinkle almond
mixture evenly over egg mixture.  Bake 20-25 minutes, until almonds
are golden brown and custard is set. Cool completely on wire rack.
Cut into bars. Serve at room temperature or chilled.  Refrigerate
leftover bars.
