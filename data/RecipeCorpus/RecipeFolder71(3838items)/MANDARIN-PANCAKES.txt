Title: MANDARIN PANCAKES
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 24 Servings
2 c  All purpose flour, unsifted
3/4 c  Boiling water
2 tb Sesame oil (more or less)
Measure flour into a bowl and mix in water with a fork or
chopsticks. Work dough several minutes until it holds together, then
knead on a lightly floured board until smooth and satiny (about ten
minutes). Cover and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Roll
dough into a 12 inch long log.  Cut into 12 equal pieces and keep
covered.
To make each pancake, cut one piece of dough exactly in half. Roll
each half into a ball and flatten slightly. Roll each ball on a very
lightly floured board to a round 3 inches in diameter. Brush sesame
oil lightly on top of one round and cover with another round. Press
the 2 rounds lightly but firmly together. Place the double round on a
lightly floured board and roll out, from center to edges, until 7 or
8 inches in diameter (don't worry if rounds are not perfect). Turn
frequently, brushing board lightly with flour as needed.  Repeat
procedure until you have 2 or 3 pancakes; then cook before making
more.
Heat a wide frying pan over medium-high heat, then place a pancake
on the ungreased surface.  Turn about every 15 seconds until cake is
blistered by air pockets, turns parchment color and feels dry. Cake
should not brown, but a few golden spots won't hurt. If overcooked,
cake becomes brittle. Remove from pan and carefully pull the two
halves apart and stack them on a plate.  Keep covered as you cook
remaining cakes. Serve warm; or let cool, wrap airtight, and
refrigerate of freeze for later use.
To heat for serving, thaw if frozen.  Line a flat-bottomed steamer
with towel dipped in water and wrung dry; stack pancakes inside and
fold towel over pancakes. Cover and steam over simmering water for
five minutes. Fold hot pancakes in half, then in half again, and
arrange in a serving basket. Since they dry out quickly, serve just a
few at a time and keep remainder covered.
