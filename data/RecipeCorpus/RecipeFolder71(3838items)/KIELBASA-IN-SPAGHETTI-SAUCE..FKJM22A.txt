Title: KIELBASA IN SPAGHETTI SAUCE..FKJM22A
Categories: Beef, Main dish, Appetizers
Yield: 6 Servings
1 pk Kielbasa
1 x  Prego meat flav. spag. sauce
1 x  Honey
Take Kielbasa and slice into bite size slices. Coat
liberally with spaghetti sauce. Add honey and mix
well. You should use about 1 part honey to 5 parts
spaghetti sauce. Cook on high heat, stirring
frequently, until hot and bubbly. Turn heat down and
simmer for 30 minutes, stirring frequently. May be
cooked on stovetop, in microwave, or in crockpot. I've
tried all three methods and they work equally well.
This makes a very rich tasting dish that can be served
as a main dish or an appetizer.
