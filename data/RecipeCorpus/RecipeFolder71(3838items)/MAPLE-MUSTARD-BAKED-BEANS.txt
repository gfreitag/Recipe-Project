Categories: Legumes, Bbq, Posted-mm, Suzy
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Navy beans
1 lg Onion, cut in half
5    Whole cloves
1 lg Onion, whole
1/3 c  Dark brown sugar
1/2 c  Maple syrup, *Amber Grade
Plus to taste
1/3 c  Prepared coarse mustard
Plus to taste
1 ts Salt, or minus to taste
-Fresh grd. pepper, to taste
Wash and pick over beans to remove small stones. In a large saucepan,
place the beans with the onion halves and pour in enough water to
cover them by 2-inches. Bring to a boil; boil 2 minutes. Remove from
heat, cover and let stand for 1 hour.

Drain and discard the onion. Fill the pan with an equal amount of
fresh hot water and bring to a boil. Simmer the beans for
approximately 20-30 minutes, or until partially done. Drain, but
reserve cooking water.

In the meantime preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Stick the cloves
in the whole onion and place it in a bean pot. Place the beans on top.

In a small bowl, combine sugar, maple syrup, mustard, salt, and
pepper, and stir in 1/2 cup of bean cooking water. Pour this mixture
over the beans, cover the pot, and place in the middle of the oven.

Bake for about 2 1/2 hours. Uncover the pot and bake another half
hour to brown the top. Check that the beans do not cook dry. Taste
the beans, add a little more syrup and/or mustard if necessary.
