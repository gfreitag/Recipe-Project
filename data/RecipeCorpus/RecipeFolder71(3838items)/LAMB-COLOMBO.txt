* Boniato - a Carribbean Sweet potato that is not as sweet as an
American sweet potato - you can substitute any good boiling potato,
such as Yukon Gold. NOTE: While this dish is traditionally made with
kid, other meats, poultry or seafood are all delicious in this
recipe. Heat 1/2 T of the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
Season lamb with salt and pepper and brown on all sides, working in
batches if necessary to keep from crowding the pan. With a slotted
spoon, transfer the lamb to a platter lined with paper towels. Pour
off any fat. Heat the remaining 1/2 T oil over medium heat.  Add
onions, scallions or chives, garlic and ginger; cook, stirring, until
the vegetables are soft but not brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in
Colombo Powder and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Return the lamb to the pan. Add 5 c of stock or water, tomato paste
and thyme. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1
hour. Add boniatos or potatoes and calabaza or squash and continue to
cook, covered, for 30 minutes more, or until very tender. Add
additional stock or water as necessary to keep the stew moist. (The
stew can be prepared 2 days ahead to this stage and reheated.)  Just
before serving, stir in lime juice and adjust seasonings with salt
and pepper. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve.
