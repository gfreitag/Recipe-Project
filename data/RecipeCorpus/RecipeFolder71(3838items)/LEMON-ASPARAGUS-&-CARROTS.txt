Nancy O'Brion's Notes: The Asparagus and Carrots made 1/3 cup per 1
person...you  could have a free salad also. This was very
taste....even a family member that don't like cooked carrots, like
these cook carrots. Also we just nuked in the mircowave stove for
about 10 minutes. The lemon juice and the lemon pepper really did
make a nice change for us. (are tryig hard to cut back on the fat.)
Used fresh asparagus.
