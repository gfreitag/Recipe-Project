FROSTING: 1 cup cocoa, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water

(Makes 6 (12 inch) rolls

In a large bowl combine almond paste, sugar, salt, butter, shortening
and eggs. Beat till smooth.  Beat in flour, baking powder and
extracts. Place dough on a floured surface and knead a few times til
smooth ball is formed. Cut dough into 3 pieces. Preheat oven to 375
F. (Moderate) To prepare filling, mix cocoa, sugar and water in a
bowl til a paste is formed. Roll out 1 piece of dough to a 24 X
6-inch rectangle. Spoon paste in a long ribbon down the center of the
dough. Wrap dough around filling and shape into a smooth roll. Cut
roll into 2 (12 inch) lengths and place on a greased cookie sheet
about 4 inches apart.  Repeat with the second piece of dough
spreading with walnuts. Repeat with third piece of dough spreading
with candied fruits. Brush all rolls with egg wash and sprinkle with
additional sugar.  Bake the 6 rolls for 45 minutes, or until richly
browned.  Cool on racks. Cut rolls into1-inch pieces, slicing
crosswise. NOTE: Mandelbreit tastes even better after aging for 1
week wrapped in foil. Slice after unwrapping.
