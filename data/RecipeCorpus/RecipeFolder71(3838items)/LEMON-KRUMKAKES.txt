Title: LEMON KRUMKAKES
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Butter
3 ea Eggs, beaten
1 c  Whipped cream
1/2 ts Grated lemon rind
1 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
Cream together sugar and butter.  Add eggs, whipped cream and lemon
rind. Add enough flour to make a batter that spreads easily on the
iron. COOKING INSTRUCTIONS:
You will need a krumkake iron, which fits over a 7-inch burner
surface (gas or electric).  Always use moderate heat.
For each baking period, the iron should be lightly rubbed at the
beginning with unsalted butter, but after this initial greasing,
nothing more is required. The batter needs a preliminary testing, as
it is quite variable, depending on the condition of the flour, so do
NOT add at once all the flour called for in the recipe. Test the
batter for consistency by baking 1 teaspoonful first. The iron is
geared to use 1 tablespoon of batter for each wafer, and it should
spread easily over the whole surface but should not run over when
pressed down. If the batter is too thin, add more flour.  Should any
batter drip over, lift the iron off its frame and cut off the excess
batter with a knife run along the edge of the iron.
Cook each wafer about 2 minutes on each side or until barely
colored. As soon as you remove it from the iron, roll it on a wooden
spoon handle or cone form, and, when cool, fill it.
