MMMMM-------------------------EQUIPMENT------------------------------
1 kouglof mold (1x3.5 litre/
-- 6 pints or 2x1.75 litre)
-- Traditionally, Kouglof
-- (also spelt Kugelhopf or
-- gougelhopf) is baked in a
-- tall, fluted mold.
-- A savarin or baba mould
-- can be used instead.
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
25 g  Fresh yeast (1 oz)
120 ml Milk (4 fl oz), boiled and
-- cooled to lukewarm
15 g  Fine salt (1/2 oz)
500 g  Flour (1 lb 2 oz)
6    Eggs
350 g  Butter (12 oz)
75 g  Sugar (3 oz)
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
200 g  Raisins (7 oz)
3 tb Rum
100 g  Whole almonds (4 oz),skinned
-- and very light toasted
1    Egg yolk mixed with 1 table-
-- spoon milk
Butter for the mould
Icing sugar for dusting
Preparation, dough
Put the yeast and the milk in the bowl of your mixer
and beat lightly. Add the salt, then the flour and the
eggs. Switch the mixer on to medium speed and work the
mixture with the dough hook for about 10 minutes,
until the dough is smooth and elastic with plenty of
body. If you are making it by hand, use a spatula and
work the dough for about 20 minutes. Mix together the
butter and sugar, reduce the speed of the mixer to low
and add the butter mixture to the dough, a little at a
time, working the dough continuously. When all the
butter is incorporated, increase the speed and mix for
8 to 10 minutes in the mixer or about 15 minutes by
hand, until the dough is very smooth and glossy. It
should be supple and fairly elastic and will be coming
away from the sides of the bowl. Cover the dough with
a baking sheet and leave it in a warm place (about 24
C/75 F) for 2 hours, until it has doubled in bulk.
Knock back the dough by punching it with your fist not
more than 2 or 3 times. Cover it with a baking tray
and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, but not loner
than 24 hours.

Preparation, raisins:
Put the raisins in a bowl with the rum, cover with
clingfilm and leave to macerate for several hours.

Moulding
Generously butter the mould and place one-third of the
almonds in the bottom of the ridges.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled
dough into a narrow rectangle long enough to line the
bottom of the mould. Chop the remaining almonds and
strew them and the rum-soaked raisins over the dough.
Roll out the dough into a fat sausage shape, pressing
it firmly together. Arrange it round the bottom of the
mould and press down lightly. Seal the two edges
together with a very little egg yolk-milk-mixture.
Leave in a warm place (about 25 C/77 F) for about 2
1/2 hours, until the dough has risen to three-quarters
fill the mould. Preheat the oven to 220 C/425 F.
Bake the kouglof in the preheated oven for 10 minutes,
then lower the temperature to 200 C/400 F and cook for
another 35 minutes. If it is becoming to brown towards
the end, cover it with greaseproof paper. Invert the
hot kouglof on to a wire rack, carefully remove the
mould and return it to the oven for 5 minutes so that
the centre finishes cooking and becomes ligthly
coloured. Leave to cool for at leat 2 hours before
serving.

Serving
Lightly sprinkle with icing sugar.
Kouglof freezes very well once cooked. Wrap in a
plastic bag and freeze; it will keep for several
weeks. Be sure to take it out of the freezer 2 or 3
hours before serving. (The Roux Brothers, French
