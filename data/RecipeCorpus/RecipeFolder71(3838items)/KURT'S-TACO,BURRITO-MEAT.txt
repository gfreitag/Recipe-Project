Place sliced chorizo in cold heavy skillet; turn on
flame to lowest setting. The idea is to render the fat
from the chorizo before cooking it.

Meanwhile, prepare the onion, bell pepper, celery and
garlic.

After the chorizo has sizzled and released it's fat
(about 10 minutes) use a spatula to break it into
small bits.  Turn up the heat and add the onion,
celery, and green pepper; saute for 8 minutes. Add the
garlic and saute for another 2 minutes.

Drain fat from the mixture by placing on a paper towel
on top of a brown paper bag or newspaper.

In the same skillet, brown the ground beef or turkey.
Crumble the meat. (A potato masher works great.)

When browned, drain off most of the fat.  (Tilt the
skillet and use a baister to suck it out.)  Stir the
masa in to absorb the remaining juices.

Add the chorizo mix, green chiles, W. sauce and
remaining spices. Let it cook on the lowest heat for
another 30 minutes, stirring every
10    minutes to prevent stickage.

NOTES: * If you cannot find chorizo, a workable
substitute is:
1/2 lb Ground pork
1 1/2 ts White vinegar
1 ts Paprika
1 tb Chili powder
1/2 ts Oregano
1 ea Garlic clove; minced
1/2 ts salt
1 ds cayenne

Mix ingredients and let the flavors blend in fridge
for a day.

~ All measurements are approximate; I cook by feel. ~
The vegies saute'd with the chorizo =really= makes a
difference. ~ Ground turkey -vs- beef: either works
great, as long as it's lean. ~ Use flour instead of
masa harina if not available. ~ The end result should
=not= be greasy/drippy! ~ Substitute fresh Anaheim or
California chiles for the canned
chiles. If doing so (recommended), saute' along with
other veggies
in the chorizo.
