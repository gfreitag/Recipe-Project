You will need a large straight-sided earthenware pot. Scald the
earthenware pot and grease it thoroughly with a little of the lard
(you can line the bottom with a few fig or walnut leaves if you have
them). Cut the beef and pork into slices, trimming the gristle and
sinews as you do so. Put the bay leaves on the bottom of the pot. Lay
in the meat slices, zseasoning with the herbs, salt, and freshly
ground pepper as you do so. Pour in the wine - it should just cover
the meat.

Simmer the pot uncovered over a very low heat or in a preheated 250 F
oven, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the volume is reduced by half.
Allow to cool. Seal with a layer of lard, melted and poured over the
cool meat. Cover with wax paper tied down with string.  Leave the pot
on a refrigerator shelf for a week.  Then remove the lard seal and
add in another 2 lbs pork and 2 lbs beef, the whole covered with
wine, seasoned and cooked as before. Repeat the operation at the end
of another week. You will now have a delicious dark jelly- meat which
you can either eat hot or cold. If you continue to replace the volume
you have removed, the pot can go on forever.
