For those who love hot spices, this dish of linguini with garam
masala and garlic, and shredded Chinese leaf, makes a refreshing
change from blander pasta dishes. Serve this one with a tomato and
onion salad and some hot nan bread.

Heat the oil gently and fry the garlic, garam masala and turmeric
together for a few minutes. Then stir in the Chinese leaves and
stir-fry until they soften. Add the stock, heat through and season
with a little salt. Then mix in the yogurt, and when the sauce is
smooth and even pour over the hot, drained linguini and toss
thoroughly. Serve at once, on hot plates.
