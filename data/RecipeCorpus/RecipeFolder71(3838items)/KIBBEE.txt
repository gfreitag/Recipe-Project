Title: KIBBEE
Categories: Lamb/mutton, Lebanese
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Leg of lamb (have fat &
-bone removed; ground fine
-twice) Approx. 4-5 pounds
1 c  Bulgur wheat; soaked for
-1/2 hour in warm water
1 lg Onion; grated
Salt; to taste
Pepper; to taste
1 ds Cinnamon
1 ds Allspice
1/3 c  Pine nuts
Squish wheat in hands to remove water.  Then mix all
ingredients well. Taste to see if you need more
spices.   (It's ok to eat this raw; indeed, it is
considered a delicacy, although personally I prefer it
cooked!)

Grease a large baking pan, at least 13x9 or larger.

Divide meat in half.  Make bottom layer.  Flatten with
hands until even. Add pine nuts.

Add top layer of meat and flatten until even.  Cut
diagonal lines in both directions, not all the way
through, so have diamond pattern. Dot well with butter
and Crisco, more butter (or margarine) than Crisco.
Use half teaspoonfuls at a time.  Should be a pat
every couple inches or so...

Bake for 1 1/2 hours at 350 degrees, or until brown.
