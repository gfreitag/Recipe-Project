Thaw the roast.  Make deep pokes in the fatty part of

with liquid smoke and alae, getting both into the
holes.  Wrap roast in ti leaves.  Split banana leaves
down middle vein and cover ti leaves.  Wrap in
aluminum foil and seal. Cook for 11 hours in a kamado
with a hot fire, using 5 lbs of charcoal or keawe for
a Hawaiian touch.  Check coals every 2 hours to see if
the fire is still hot. Meat is done when it shreds

wrap as directed and roast in an oven at 200 degrees
