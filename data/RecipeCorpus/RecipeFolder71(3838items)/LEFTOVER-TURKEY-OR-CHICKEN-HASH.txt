Heat in frying pan 2-3 Tbsp melted butter or turkey or chicken fat.
Add thinly sliced onion and diced celery. Heat 5-8 minutes over low
heat, stirring often. Add 2-3 cups cooked turkey. Cook 5 minutes over
low heat.

Sauce: Brown the chicken fat (I would use butter) and flour well
before adding water. Add savory, salt and pepper to taste. When sauce
is smooth and creamy, add 1/4 cup cream and any remaining turkey or
chicken gravy. Pour over turkey. Simmer 15 minutes, then serve with
hot biscuits and pickled beets.

Hot Biscuits: Sift together in bowl, flour, baking powder (no error in
amount) and salt. Mix together cream with 2 beaten eggs. Add to flour
and mix just enough to moisten; the dough is rather soft and should
remain lumpy. Stir as little as possible. Drop by spoonfuls on a
greased cookie sheet. Cook 16 minutes at 400F.

from Mme. Benoit, "In days that followed Christmas, every bit of the
turkey was used - the bones for soup, the skin, diced and crisped in
the oven until browned, then served, instead of butter, on toasted
homemade bread. So, when it came time to make hash from all the
little bits and pieces, the children felt that the poor turkey must
be tired (fatiguee), hence the name.
