Title: KUGEL
Categories: Pasta, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 10 Servings
6    Egg
Salt; pepper to taste
1/4 lb Butter
1 lb Noodles,
Combine butter with hot cooked noodles, Add eggs and
stir until blended in. Season to taste. put in 9 x 13
pan and bake at 350 for one hour. Serve with roasted
anything. It's a forgiving recipe. For a lighter
tyaller kugel..beat whites first; but I never do! This
is the good old fashioned way of serving what's 'bad'
for you but tastes so good. These days i only make it
for special occasions...like when little Sara comes to
dinner.
