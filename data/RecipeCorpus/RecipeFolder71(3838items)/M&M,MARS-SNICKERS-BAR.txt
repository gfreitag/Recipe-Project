Title: M&M/MARS SNICKERS BAR
Categories: Candy, Top secret, Choc
Yield: 1 Batch
1/4 c  Light corn syrup
2 tb Butter, softened
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/8 c  Creamy peanut butter
-dash salt
3 c  Powdered sugar
35    Unwrapped Kraft caramels
1 c  Dry-roasted unsalted peanuts
12 oz Milk-chocolate chips
With the mixer on high speed, combine the corn syrup, butter, vanilla,
peanut butter, and salt until creamy. Slowly add the powdered sugar.
When the mixture has the consistency of dough, remove it from the
bowl with your hands and press it into a lightly greased 9x9" pan.
Set in the refrigerator.

Melt the caramels in a small pan over low heat.  When the caramel is
soft, mix in the peanuts.  Pour the mixture over the refrigerated
nougat in the pan.  Let this cool in the refrigerator.

When the refrigerator mixture is firm, melt the chocolate over low
heat in a double boiler or in a microwave oven set on high for 2
minutes. Stir halfway through cooking time.

When the mixture in the pan has hardened, cut into 2x1" sections.

Set each chunk onto a fork and dip into the melted chocolate. Tap the
fork against the side of the bowl or pan to knock off any excess
chocolate. Then place the chunks on waxed paper to cool at room
temperature (less than 70 degrees.)  This could take several hours,
but the bars will set best this way.  You can speed up the process by
placing the bars in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
