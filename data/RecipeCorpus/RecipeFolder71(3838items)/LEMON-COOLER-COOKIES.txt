Title: LEMON COOLER COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 42 Servings
1 c  Unsalted butter; room temp.
1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 tb Grated lemon peel
1    Egg yolk
1 ts Lemon extract
1/4 ts Salt
2 1/2 c  Flour
Sugar
Powdered sugar
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Using electric mixer, cream butter in
medium bowl until light.  Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar and beat until
fluffy, stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl. Beat in
lemon peel, yolk, extract and salt.  Add flour and beat just until
blended (if dough is very stiff, beat with a wooden spoon).

Roll dough by tablespoonfuls into balls.  Set dough balls on
ungreased heavy baking sheets, spacing 3 inches apart. Dip bottom of
2-1/2"-round glass into sugar. Press down onto 1 dough ball,
flattening into 1/4" thick round.  Repeat with remaining dough balls.
Bake until cookie edges begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer
cookies to racks and cool. Sift powdered sugar over tops.  (Can be
prepared 3 days ahead. Store at room temperature in airtight
container.)
