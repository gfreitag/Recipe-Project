Categories: Cookies, Christmas, Hungarian
Yield: 6 Dozen
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
4 3/4 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
2 c  Butter or margarine
4 lg Egg yolks, slightly beaten
1 c  Sour cream
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 1/4 lb Shelled walnuts (about 5
Cups), ground
1 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Milk
1 tb Almond extract
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
1 lg Egg, beaten
Confectioners' sugar
Make dough: in a large bowl, place the flour and the
butter.  Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the
butter into the flour until the mixture resembles
coarse crumbs.  Add the egg yolks and sour cream; stir
with a fork until combined.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board or
pastry cloth.  Knead the dough with your hands until
it is smooth and can be shaped into a ball.  If dough
is too sticky, knead in more flour.  If desired, wrap
dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate.

Make filling: in a medium-sized bowl, place the ground
walnuts, granulated sugar, milk and almond extract.
Using a wooden spoon, stir in walnut mixture until
ingredients are thoroughly combined.  Prehead oven to
400F. Grease baking sheets with solid vegetable
shortening.

To shape Kifli: divide the dough into quarters; wrap
three of the quarters separately in plastic wrap and
set aside.  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the
remaining quarter of the dough to a 15" x 12"
rectangle that is 1/8" thick.

Using a pastry wheel, cut the rectangle of dough into
3-inch squares. Place a heaping teaspoon of the walnut
filling in the center of each square; bring one corner
of the dough over the filling to the opposite corner;
pinch edges together.

Place Kifli on baking sheets; brush with the beaten
egg.  Bake for 10 minutes or until cookies are golden
brown.  Remove from the baking sheet. Fill the bottom
of a pie place with confectioners' sugar.  Roll Kifli
in the sugar.  Let cool on wire racks.  Repeat steps
with the remaining three quarters of dough.
