paper towel.

Arrange bean curd, potatoes, spinach, and cabbage on individual

Prepare dressing by placing all of the dressing ingredients in a

another teaspoon of water.

Top vegetables and bean curd with the bean sprouts and dressing, and
serve immediately.

This salad is also good after being chilled.
