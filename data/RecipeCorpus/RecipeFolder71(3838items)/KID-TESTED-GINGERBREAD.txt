Title: KID-TESTED GINGERBREAD
Categories: Biscuits, Desserts
Yield: 3 Dozen
1 c  Light-brown sugar
1 1/2 ts Each of cinnamon and
Ground ginger
1/4 ts Salt
3/4 ts Baking soda
1/4 c  Boiling water
1/2 c  Unsalted butter
1/4 c  Molasses
2 c  All-purpose flour
Place sugar, spices, salt and baking soda in a large
bowl. Stir in water until sugar is dissolved. Stir in
butter until melted, then molasses. Gradually stir in
about 1 1/2 cups flour. Continue stirring in remaining
flour a little at a time. When dough becomes stiff,
flour hands and knead until firm enough to roll out.
Roll out right away, or wrap and refrigerate for up to
2 weeks or freeze. To roll out, place half of dough on
a lightly floured board. Roll to 1/4-inch thickness.
Use a floured cookie cutter to cut out shapes. Place
on a greased baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 300F
oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until edges are firm.
Store in a covered container at room temperature. This
recipe can be doubled easily. Makes about 34 (3-inch)
star-shaped cookies.
