Title: LOW-CALORIE POTATO~ ONION~ & GARLIC GRATIN
Categories: Potato, Garlic, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
4 lg Baking potatoes, baked,
... scooped out and mashed
2 lg Garlic heads, roasted
2 lg Onions, baked
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tb Buttermilk
4 tb Parmesan, grated
1/4 c  Skim milk
Remove the papery covering of the garlic heads, but do not peel and
do not separate the cloves.  Wrap well in foil and put them in the
oven. Put the onions on a double sheet of foil, but do not wrap them;
put them in the oven. Bake the garlic for one hour and the onions for
an hour and a half at 425. After an hour pull out the garlic heads,
unwrap, and let cool for 5 minutes.  Separate the cloves and squeeze
them over a bowl so the softened garlic pops out into the bowl. After
1 1/4 hours, pull out the onions. If they are not very soft (almost
collapsed) put them back in for a few minutes. With a sharp knife,
cut off the stem and root ends of the onions. Remove the skin and the
first layer. Put the onions in a food processor and puree. Reduce the
oven to 350. Beat together the onions, garlic, and potatoes; and salt
and pepper to taste. Beat in the buttermilk. Scrape the mixture into
a gratin dish. Smooth the top and sprinkle with the cheese. (The
recipe can be prepared to this point ahead of time and kept in the
refrigerator for a couple of days. Bring to room temperature before
proceeding) Drizzle milk evenly over the top of the potatoes. Bake
uncovered for 35 - 45 minutes, or until brown, bubbly, and thoroughly
hot. Serve at once.
