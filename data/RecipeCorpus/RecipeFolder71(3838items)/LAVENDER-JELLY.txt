This exotic and gorgeously pretty jelly comes from John McGeever of
Congham Hall in Norfolk and can be eaten both as a superb dessert
with, perhaps, a little cream, or as an unusual accompaniment to
roast game or rabbit.

Gently heat the champagne or white wine with the apple juice, creme de
cassis, sugar and lemon juice.  Pour onto the lavender flowers and
leave, covered, to infuse for about 10 minutes. Sprinkle the gelatine
onto the water and leave to soften, then heat gently until the
gelatine is completely dissolved.

Strain the lavender liquid, pressing it to extract all the juices.
Warm the lavender liquid and add the dissolved gelatine. Stir and
strain again through a fine sieve or muslin. Leave to cool and set.
The jelly will keep for about 14 days in a fridge.
