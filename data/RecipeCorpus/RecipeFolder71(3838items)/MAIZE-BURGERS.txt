1 ts Ground cumin, or to taste
2 ts Chili powder

1    Fresh jalapeno pepper *

The crunch of corn with your favorite salsa makes a delicious,
lower-fat Southwestern hamburger served on a flour tortilla with
shredded lettuce and lime wedges.

In a mixing bowl, mix lightly the ground beef, cornmeal, lime juice,
egg white, cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper and jalapeno. Shape into
6 large thin patties and reserve on a sheet of wax paper.

Over medium-high heat, heat a 12-inch skillet, then add the oil to
coat the bottom. Place patties in the hot skillet and cook 3 to 5
minutes per side, turning once, until the meat is cooked through and
the patties are a deep golden brown.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine corn and salsa and heat. In
the microwave, heat flour tortillas wrapped in a cloth or on paper
plates for 15 seconds on high.

To serve, place a cooked patty on a flour tortilla, top with a
serving of salsa and fold. Add shredded lettuce if desired. Serve a
wedge of lime alongside.

Note: When preparing fresh chilies, wear rubber gloves for protection
against oils that later can cause burning sensation on skin.

Makes 6 servings.
