Title: LIME SORBET
Categories: Barry, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
10 fl Freshly-squeezed lime juice
8 oz Caster Sugar
2    Egg whites
Heat the juice and the caster sugar together gently until the sugar
has completely dissolved. Test for sweetness and if necessary add a
little more sugar. Pour the mixture into a plastic container and put
in the freezer. After three to 4 hours, when the mixture is pretty
well frozen, spoon it into a food processor and whiz it until it is a
mush. Beat the egg whites in a separate bowl until they're firm and
stir into the mush.

Put it all back into the container and freeze for another 3 or 4
hours. The sorbet should be solid but have quite a soft texture.

To serve allow to stand in the fridge for 20 minutes or so before
scooping into individual glasses or bowls.
