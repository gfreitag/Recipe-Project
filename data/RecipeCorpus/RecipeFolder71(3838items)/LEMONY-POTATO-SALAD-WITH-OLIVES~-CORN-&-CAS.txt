Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add whole potatoes and
reduce heat. Simmer potatoes for 12-15 minutes, or until just tender.
Don't overcook; potatoes should be firm but cooked through. Drain
potatoes in cold water and place in an ice bath to cool completely.
Remove potatoes from ice bath and quarter.

To make dressing, combine lemon zest, juice, mustard, tarragon and
green onions in a medium, nonreactive bowl and whisk thoroughly.
Slowly drizzle in olive oil while whisking. Add red pepper and salt
and season to taste.

Set aside.

In a large salad or mixing bowl, place quartered potatoes and gently
mix in the corn, olives, cashews and parsley, reserving some of the
parsley for garnish. Whisk dressing and mix into salad throughly.
Don't overly handle the potatoes, or they will break apart. Garnish
with remaining parsley.

Can be made a day ahead and refrigerated covered. Serve at room
temperature.

ZESTING LEMONS

A lemon zester is an invaluable kitchen tool. Another very successful
method is to use a vegetable peeler to pull long, thin slices of zest
off the lemon. Always avoid the bitter white pith when zesting any
citrus.
