Title: LEMON APRICOT PIE
Categories: Pies, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/3 c  Eagle Brand Sweetened
-Condensed Milk
1/4 c  Lemon juice
g  Rind of 1/2 lemon
1 c  Apricot pulp
Baked pie shell (9 in.)
Blend together Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk, lemon juice,
grated lemon rind and apricot pulp.  Pour into baked pie shell. Cover
with whipped cream or meringue. Chill before serving. If meringue is
used, beat two egg whites until stiff and add two tablespoons of
granulated sugar. Spread on pie and bake in a moderate oven (350F)
until brown.

To prepare pulp, drain off liquid from canned or freshly stewed
apricots and force through a coarse strainer. [These days I'd say use
a food processor. Remember, this book is pre-just about everything
but electric refrigerators.  Prunes can be used in place of the
apricots. S.C.]
