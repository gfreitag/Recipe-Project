Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high
heat. Add the onion, garlic, and carrot, and saute for 5 minutes,
stirring constantly.  Add the thyme and ginger and saute gently for 2
minutes, until the vegetables are softened but not browned.  Remove
the pan from the heat and allow to cool.

Place 1 cup of the cooked lentils in the work bowl of a food
processor and puree into a paste.  Remove the lentils from the
processor and place in a large mixing bowl. Add the walnuts, mixing
well, then add the remaining lentils.  If the mixture appears too dry
or thick, add the vegetable stock, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the
lentil batter is easy to handle, yet not too moist or thin.  Season
with salt and pepper. Divide the mixture into 8 equal portions and
form into round patties. Heat the remaining oil in the skillet over
medium-high-heat and saute the patties for 2 minutes on each side.
Remove the patties from the pan, drain on kitchen towels, and keep
warm.  Serve with Mushroom Vinaigrette #5. Makes 4 appetizer or 2
main course servings.
