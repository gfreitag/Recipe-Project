This dish has a nice poetic name, as the three words
of the name rhyme. Those who don't like chili can
always leave it out. Method:
Mix the lime juice and fish sauce, and marinate the
chicken for about an hour.
Pound the lemon grass with a mallet or meat tenderizer
and then very thinly slice it.
Heat a little oil in a wok or skillet to medium high
heat, add the shallots, onions, garlic, prik phom and
lemon grass, and stir fry until aromatic.
Add the chicken and marinade and stir fry until it
starts to change color.  Add the remaining ingredients
and stir fry until heated through and the chicken is
fully cooked. Serve with steamed [jasmine] rice.
This dish can also be made with shrimp (kung sai
takrai).
