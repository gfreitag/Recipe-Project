4 c  Chicken stock

Soak mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes.  Drain, reserving

simmer 5 minutes. Add bean curd and again bring to a boil. Add small
amount of hot liquid to cornstarch paste, stirring. Add mixture to

Beat egg lightly and slowly add it to hot soup.  Stir once, gently.
Remove soup from heat.  Sprinkle with chopped scallion and sesame
oil. Serve immediately.

NOTES:

*  Bamboo shoot, pork and mushroom soup -- I worked out this recipe
in an attempt to duplicate the Mandarin Soup served at the Peking
Royal Kitchen in Pittsburgh. My friends all agree that it is a good
replica; some prefer my version to the "real thing." Yield: Serves
4-6.

*  The quality of the chicken stock makes a huge difference in a
recipe like this. Use fresh stock if you can, or buy the best grade
of canned chicken stock you can find.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes waiting and 20 minutes preparing.
: Precision:  Measure spices and seasonings.
