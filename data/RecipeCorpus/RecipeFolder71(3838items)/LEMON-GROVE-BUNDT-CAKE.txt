1 c  Butter; softened
2 c  Sugar
3 lg Eggs
3 c  Flour, All-Purpose; sifted
1/2 ts Baking Soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Buttermilk
2 tb Lemon Peel; grated
2 tb Lemon Juice; fresh
Lemon Icing:
1/4 c  Butter; softened
2 c  Sugar, powdered
1 1/2 tb Lemon Peel; grated
1/4 c  Lemon Juice; fresh
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a very large bowl, cream butter (or
margarine) until very light; slowly add sugar until mixture is very
light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time.
In another bowl, sift flour, baking soda and salt together. Add flour
mixture alternately with buttermilk to butter mixture. Begin and end
with flour. Mix in lemon peel and juice.
Pour batter into greased and floured 10-inch tube or 12-inch bundt
pan. Bake for 65-75 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center
comes out clean. Place pan on rack for 10 minutes to cool. Turn cake
out of pan onto rack. Spread with as much lemon icing as the cake can
absorb (about a third of the icing) Allow cake to cool completely
then frost with remaining icing.
ICING: Blend butter and sugar together in a medium bowl. Mix in peel
and juice, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the frosting is of spreading
consistency. If the entire amount of juice is used, the icing will be
thin and possibly difficult to spread evenly, however a very tangy
frosting greatly enhances the flavor of the cake.
This cake was a second place winner at the Del Mar fair.
