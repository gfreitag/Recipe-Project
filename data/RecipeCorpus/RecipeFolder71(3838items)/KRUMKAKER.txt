Title: KRUMKAKER
Categories: Norwegian, Desserts, Cookies
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Sugar
4    Eggs
1/2 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Butter
1 1/2 ts Ground cardamom
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
2 1/2 ts Cornstarch
3 tb Cold water
Using a stationary or hand-held mixer, beat together
the sugar, eggs, and vanilla until the mixture is
light and airy.

Melt the butter and let it cool.  Sift the cardamom
and flour together. Mix the cornstarch and water until
smooth. With the mixer on low speed, alternately add
the butter and flour to the sugar-egg mixture. Beat in
the cornstarch mixture.

Pour a spoonful of batter on a heated krumkaker iron,
press it shut, and bake the cookie until golden on
each side. Drape around a cone or in a cup until dry.

I like to serve these with whipped cream that has
cloud berries (multebaer) whipped into it.   Realizing
that cloud berries are hard to come by, my second
choice would be raspberries.
