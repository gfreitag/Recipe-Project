Title: MAPLE FLAVORED SMOKED TURKEY
Categories: Smoking
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------BRINE--------------------------------
1/2 c  Salt
1/3 c  Sugar brown
1/2 ts Maple flavoring
1 ts Onion powder
1 ts Celery salt
1 c  White wine
1 tb Pepper
3 c  Water
Place turkey in brine for 8 to 12 hours.  Remove from brine. Rinse
and air dry for at least one hour.  Open upper and lower body
cavities to expose to smoke. Place in smoker and smoke with your
favorite fuel. Smoke for 30 minutes per pound approximately.  i.e. 10
lbs = 5 hours

Remove from smoker and bake in the oven at 300 degrees for about 15
minutes per pound.  You may also use your smoker, if it is a
convertable model, in a roast mode to cook the turkey. Turkey is done
when joints separate easily from the body and if the meat is pierced
with a toothpick the juices are clear.  Watch the bird closely during
the roasting phase as different birds will require greatly differing
time for cooking depending upon the temperature of the smoker.

NOTE:  If desired the brown sugar may be replaced with maple syrup
giving the bird a more maple flavor.
