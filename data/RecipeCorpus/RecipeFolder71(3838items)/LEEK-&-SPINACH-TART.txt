Title: LEEK & SPINACH TART
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Cooked Spinach
2 tb Oil
2    Leeks, thinly sliced
12 oz Puff Pastry
4 oz Blue Cheese
Beaten Egg to Glaze
Drain the spinach well, squeezing between two plates to extract all
the moisture, or dry off in a pan over a low heat.

Heat the oil in a pan and cook the leeks until soft. Stir in the
spinach and cook for 1 minute. Set aside to cool.

Roll out just under half the pastry to a 8 and a half inch round and
lift on to a baking sheet. Spoon the spinach and leek mixture over
the pastry to within 1 inch of the edge.

Cut the cheese into slices and arrange over the spinach mixture. Brush
pastry border with water

Roll out the remaining pastry to a round, large enough to fit over
base. Trim and press edges together to seal. Decorate top and edges
by marking with a sharp knife, taking care not to cut right through
the pastry. Pierce a hole in the top to allow steam to escape.

Chill for 30 minutes.

Set oven to 220C, 425F, Gas 7. Brush pastry with beaten egg to glaze.

Bake for about 20 minutes until puffed and golden brown. Serve hot or
cold with a salad.
