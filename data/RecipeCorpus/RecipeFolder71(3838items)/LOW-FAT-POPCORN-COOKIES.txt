Title: LOW FAT POPCORN COOKIES
Categories: Low-fat, Cookies
Yield: 24 Servings
3 c  Popped popcorn; unsalted
2    Egg whites
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
One cup at a time, grind the popcorn in a blender at low speed until
it's fine.  The goal is 1-1/2 cups of finely ground popcorn.

In a medium bowl, beat 2 egg whites on high speed until soft peaks
form. Make a meringue by gradually adding 1/4 cup sugar; beat until
egg whites are stiff. Next, beat in cinnamon, salt and vanilla.
Gently fold in ground popcorn and 1/3 cup unsweetened shredded
coconut. Place rounded tablespoonfuls onto a greased baking sheed (or
use parchment paper). Bake at 325 degrees 10 to 12 minutes or until
lightly browned. MM Wrenn
