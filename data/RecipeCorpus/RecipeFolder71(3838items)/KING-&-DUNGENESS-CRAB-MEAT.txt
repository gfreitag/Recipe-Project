best quality.

Procedure: Keep live crabs on ice until ready to can.
Wash crabs thoroughly, using several changes of cold
water. Simmer crabs 20 minutes in water containing 1/4
cup of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of salt (or up to
1 cup of salt, if desired) per gallon. Cool in cold

to remove excess moisture. Fill half-pint jars with 6
ounces of meat and pint jars with 12 ounces, leaving
1-inch headspace. Add 1/2 teaspoon of citric acid or 2
