Yield: 1 Servings
6 lb Bones and trimmings of roast
Beef
2    Cold mutton chops
The flank end of a sirloin
Steak -- uncooked
4 qt Cold water
1 tb Salt
4    Cloves
4    Peppercorns
1    Cold fried egg
2    Baked apples
1 c  Cold boiled onions
2    Stalks celery

Cut up the meat and bones, and put them in the kettle with the cold
water. Add all the other ingredients, and simmer till the bones are
clean, the meat is in rags, and the water reduced one half. Strain
and the next morning remove the fat; when ready to serve, heat the
stock to the boiling point; warm with it one cup of cold macaroni or
tomatoes left from yesterday's dinner. Add more seasoning if needed.
