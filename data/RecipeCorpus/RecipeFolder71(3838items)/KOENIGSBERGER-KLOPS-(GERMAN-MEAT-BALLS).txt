Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Beef, ground
1 lb Pork, ground
1 md Onion, chopped
1/2 c  Bread crumbs, dry
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
ds Nutmeg, ground
4    Egg, separated
1 cn Broth, beef, condensed
1 c  Water
1 lg Onion, peeled and quartered
1/4 c  Vinegar, cider
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Pickling spices, mixed
Combine ground beef and pork (I used veal too),
chopped onion, crumbs, 1 tsp of the salt, pepper and
nutmeg in a medium size bowl until blended. Separate
eggs, putting whites into a large bowl and yolks into
a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate the yolks. Beat
whites until they form soft peaks; fold into meat
mixture. Shape into 1-inch balls and place in an
electric slow cooker. (I browned these slightly in a
skillet). Combine beef broth, water, quartered onion,
vinegar, sugar, pickling spices and remaining 1/2 tsp
salt in a small saucepan. Bring to boil, lower heat
and simmer 15 minutes; strain into slow cooker; cover.
(Do same- pour into skillet, reduce heat, cover). Cook
on low (190 to 200 degrees) 5 hours; remove meat balls
to a heated deep platter and keep warm. (I cooked the
meatballs for about one hour in the skillet). Turn
heat control to high (290 to 300 degrees). Combine 1
Tbsp all-purpose flour with 2 Tbsp cold water in a
cup; stir into liquid in cooker until smooth; cover.
Cook 15 minutes. Beat the saved egg yolks with a fork;
beat in 1 cup of hot sauce; return to cooker; cook 5
minutes; then pour over meat balls. (Increase heat,
add flour & water mixture and simmer until thickened.
Follow above instructions for adding the egg yolks).
Garnish with lemon slices and capers; serve with
boiled parslied From Sallie Krebs - Happy Cookin'!
