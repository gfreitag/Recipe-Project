Title: LAMB & WHITE BEAN STEW
Categories: Harned 1994, Main dish, Stews, Veal, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Batch
3 lb Boneless lamb stew meat
6 tb Olive oil
1 c  Diced onions
1    Carrot; peeled and sliced
1 tb Minced garlic
28 oz Can crushed tomatoes
-- undrained
1/2 ts Each thyme and rosemary
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
2 tb Minced parsley
1 c  Dry red wine
2 c  Beef stock
3 c  Cooked Great Northern beans
Trim meat of visible fat and gristle; set aside.  Heat 3 tb. of the
oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add the lamb. Brown it on all
sides, being careful not to crowd the pan; this will have to be done
in batches. Remove lamb with a slotted spoon; place it in an
oven-proof casserole.

Add remaining fat to the pan; saute the onions, carrot and garlic,
stirring frequently, until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
Scrape mixture into the casserole with the lamb.

Add the tomatoes, thyme, rosemary, salt, pepper, parsley, wine and
stock to the pan; bring to a boil over medium high heat. Place the
pan in the center of the oven and bake at 350 F. for 2 1/2 hours, or
until lamb is beginning to become tender.  Add the beans and bake for
30 to 40 minutes.

Note: The stew is even better if made a day or two in advance and
refrigerated tightly covered.  (Discard any fat that hardens.) Reheat
in a 350 F. oven, stirring occasionally but gently.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
