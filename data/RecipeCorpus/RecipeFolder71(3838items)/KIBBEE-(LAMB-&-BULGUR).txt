1 lb Ground lean lamb
1/4 c  Minced onion
1/8 ts Ground oregano
1 1/2 ts Salt

Combine 1/2 cup lamb, nuts and 1/8 teaspoon salt.
Season to taste with pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter,
add meat mixture and cook, stirring to keep crumbly,
until light brown.

Meanwhile, rinse bulgur and drain by squeezing
handfuls at a time. Combine with 1 pound lamb, onion,
oregano and 1/2 teaspoon salt and season to taste with
pepper. Mix well. With wet hands press layer of lamb
mixture into 9-inch pie plate. Top with nut stuffing,
then with another layer of meat. Smooth surface of
meat with wet hand. Cut into wedges before baking as
crust forms during cooking. Dot with 2 tablespoons
butter. Bake at 350F 25 to 30 minutes, or until meat
reaches desired degree of doneness.
