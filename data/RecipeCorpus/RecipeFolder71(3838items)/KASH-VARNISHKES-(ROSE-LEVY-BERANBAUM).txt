until mushrooms yield their liquid. Continue cooking
uncovered until liquid evaporates.

Add kasha mixture, salt, pepper, and oregano and cook,
stirring constantly,

2 or 3 minutes.  Stir in broth and porcini mushrooms.
Cover tightly and simmer 20 minutes or until liquid is
absorbed.  Meanwhile, cook bowties according to
package directions. Drain and stir in remaining 1 tbs
goose fat.  Mix bowties into kasha mixture.  Makes 4
to 6 servings.
