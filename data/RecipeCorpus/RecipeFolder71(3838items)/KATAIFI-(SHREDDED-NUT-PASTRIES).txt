500 g  Kataifi pastry
1 c  Butter; melted
MMMMM------------------------NUT FILLING-----------------------------
1 c  Coarsely ground walnuts
1 c  Coarsely ground almonds
1/2 c  Caster sugar
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1    Egg white; lightly beaten
1 tb Brandy
MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Water
1 ts Lemon juice
1    Thin strip of lemon rind
4    Cloves
1    Piece cinnamon bark
1 tb Honey
Makes: 40 pieces Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F)
Cooking time: 50-55 minutes

Take an eighth of the pastry strands and spread out on
a board to a 18 x 25 cm (7 x 10 inch) rectangle with
strands running roughly lengthwise. Using a pastry
brush, dab some butter over strands.  Combine nut
filling ingredients and spread about 2 tablespoons of
filling along one narrow edge.  Roll up firmly into a
neat roll.  Repeat with remaining ingredients. Place
rolls close together in a 20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 inch)
slab cake pan or baking dish.  Brush top with
remaining butter.  Bake in a moderate oven, one shelf
above centre, for 50-55 minutes until golden brown.

Meanwhile, dissolve sugar in water over heat, add
lemon juice and rind, cloves and cinnamon.  Bring to
the boil and boil over medium heat for 10 minutes.
Stir in honey, strain and cool.  Pour cooled syrup
over hot pastries and place a folded cloth on top.
Leave until cool.  Cut each roll into 5 pieces
diagonally if preferred.

ALTERNATIVE SHAPING:  Take a small handful of pastry
strands and spread out fairly compactly on board.
Have strands running towards you as much as possible
and dab with butter.  Mould a tablespoon of nut
filling into a short sausage shape and place on one
end.  Roll up firmly into a neat roll and place in
baking dish.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.
Makes about 30 rolls each about 5 cm (2 inches) long.
Bake as directed above, prepare syrup and finish as in
previous recipe.
