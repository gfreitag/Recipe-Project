Egg Drop Soup is traditionally Chinese. Tomatoes are
not. They were introduced less than 100 years ago, but
nevertheless, they work wonderfully in this soup.

PUT THE CHICKEN STOCK into a pot and bring to a
simmer. If using fresh tomatoes, peel, seed and cut
into 1-inch cubes. If using canned tomatoes, chop them
into small chunks. Lightly beat the eggs, then combine
them with sesame oil in a small bowl. Add the light
soy sauce and salt to the simmering stock, and stir to
mix them in well. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 5
minutes. Next, stir in the scallions, and then add the
egg mixture in a very slow, thin stream. Using a
chopstick or fork, pull the egg slowly into strands.
(Stirring the egg in a "figure 8" works well.) Garnish
with the finely chopped scallion tops. Makes 4 to 6
Servings
