Title: KRAEUTERBUTTER
Categories: Germany, German
Yield: 1 Servings
80 g  Of butter
2 tb Of finely chopped fresh
-parsley
some estragon (and I not sure what that is in english,
I think any "italian" herb would be fine) salt, white
pepper to taste 1 Tablespoon lemon juice, a couple of
drops worcester sauce soften butter at room temp., add
finely chopped herbs, add remaining ingredients. Mix
slowly with a fork. Wet a piece of waxed paper lightly
with cold water. Put butter on paper over the length
and form a roll......... Put in fridge for it to get
hard. Shortly before serving, cut slices of butter
with knife dipped in hot water and put on plate on top
of icecubes. I personally like to add garlic (freshly
pressed through the garlic press). You can also add
some anchovy paste. or make it with dill instead of
parsley. Whatever herbs and spices you like; but it's
always better w/fresh herbs. Have fun. This recipe is
from my "das grosse menu Kochbuch". Kraeuterbutter -
