Place flour on a pastry board and make a well in the center.
Break the eggs into the well and add the water, a little at a time,
and the salt. Knead for about 10 minutes. Let stand, covered, for
about 1 hour. Cut dough into 4 pieces and roll as thin as you can.
Cut into rectangles 4 inches wide by 6 inches long. Place between
pieces of waxed paper. You should have about 12 pieces.  Cook, half
at a time, in 4 quarts salted boiling water with olive oul added.
Cook for 5 minutes. Drain and place between 2 towels.
Divide stuffing into 12 parts.  Place a mound of stuffing on
each dough rectangle about 1/3 inch from a long edge. Mound should be
about 1/2 inch thick and 1/2 inch wide. Fold dough over twice. Spread
a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking pan. Arrange
manicotti about 1/4 inch apart in the pan and spoon the rest of the
sauce over the top. Sprinkle a teaspoon of Parmesan cheese over each
of the manicotti. Bake in a preheated slow (300 F) oven for 15 to 20
minutes. Drain the ricotta cheese.  Combine all of the ingredients
and mix well.
