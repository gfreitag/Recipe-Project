"This recipe was sent to us by Ceil Downey, of
Framingham, Massachusetts, a long-time friend and user
of King Arthur Flour. This recipe contains active dry
yeast, which eliminates the need to develop a sponge.
The onion topping adds zest."

Making the Dough:  Combine 1 cup of the flour, the
sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl.  Then, combine
the milk and butter or margarine in a saucepan.  Heat
over low heat until liquid is very warm, 120 to 130
degrees (the butter does not need to melt).

Gradually add the liquids to the dry ingredients,
beating well. Blend in the starter and another cup of
flour.  Beat again. Stir in enough additional flour to
make a soft dough.

Kneading & Rising:  Turn the dough out onto a lightly
floured board and knead until smooth and elastic,
about 10 minutes. Then place it in a greased bowl,
turning the dough to grease the top. Cover and let
rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled, 1 to 2
hours.

Shaping & Rising:  Punch down the dough, turn it out
onto a board and divide it in half (or quarters).
Cover and let rest 15 minutes. Shape into 2 long
loaves (or 4 small round loaves) and place on baking
sheets that have been sprinkled with cornmeal. (For
regular-shaped loaves, place in 2 greased 4 1/2 x 8
1/2" bread pans.)  Cover and let the loaves rise until
doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Baking:  About 15 minutes before you want to bake your
bread, preheat your oven toF«,§XlU"puyÚÏÉ
