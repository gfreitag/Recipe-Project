Title: LIGHT VEGETABLE STOCK
Categories: Soups/stews, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Onion
2    Garlic cloves
1    Celery stalk
1    Carrot
1    Bouquet garni
Put all ingredients into a saucepan.  Cover generously with water and
bring to a boil.  Simmer, half-covered, for about 1 hour, then strain.

Other vegetables and flavorings, such as leeks, thinly pared lemon
rind and allspice berries, can be added. Peelings from well-scrubed
potatoes also give a particularly pleasant flavor to vegetable stock.
