Title: APLETS & COTLETS
Categories: Candies
Yield: 64 Cubes
3 tb Gelatin
3 c  Apple juice or unsweetened
-apricot juice
1 1/3 c  Granulated sugar
2 tb Each lemon and lime juice,
-or more as needed
2/3 c  Cornstarch
2 c  Walnuts, chopped
1 c  Powdered sugar
Soften the gelatin in 1/2 cup of the apple juice. Boil remaining
juice with the sugar for 15 minutes to concentrate it. Mix the lemon
and lime juice, and add all but 1/4 cup cornstarch to dissolve it in
the mixture. Add both gelatin mixture and cornstarch mixture to the
boiled juice and boil again rapidly for 10 minutes until very thick,
stirring constantly. Taste for sweet and sour and add more lemon
juice if wanted.

Mix in the walnuts and pour mixture into a 9-by-9-by-2-inch baking
pan that has been dipped in cold water. Let paste harden 12 hours or
overnight, then cut with a sharp knife into squares. Mix together the
reserved 1/4 cup cornstarch and powdered sugar. Remove squares with a
spatula and roll each in the powdered sugar mixture (the cornstarch
helps keep the sugar dry).
