Title: APPLE PANCAKES W/ CINNAMON BUTTER
Categories: Scot/irish, Breads
Yield: 8 Servings
1 2/3 c  Flour; all-purpose
1 tb Baking powder
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
4 tb Butter; melted
2    Eggs; beaten
1 1/4 c  Milk
2    Good eating apples; not
.  Golden Delicious; peeled
.  and cored
Sunflower oil for frying
MMMMM----------------------CINNAMON BUTTER---------------------------
1    Stick butter; softened
2 ts Cinnamon
3/4 c  Soft light brown sugar
First make the cinnamon butter. Beat all the ingredients together
until the mixture is smooth. Store in a covered container in the
refrigerator until serving. (This keeps for 7-10 days.)

Sift the flour, baking powder, sugar and cinnamon into a bowl. Beat
in the melted butter, beaten eggs and milk. Grate the apples into the
mixture and mix in well.

Oil a griddle, or a heavy-basedfrylng pan, or an electric hotplate,
or if you have an Aga or Rayburn, the cooler hotplate. (For my
American readers an Aga is a constantly burning range-like cooker
with two or four ovens and hotplates. It gives an even heat and very
consistent results.) Drop spoonsful of the apple batter on to the
oiled surface, making pancakes of 2-3 inches / 5-7-5cm in diameter
and leaving a space between them. Cook for about 2 minutes or until
small bubbles appear over the surface, then, with a palette knife
(pancake turner), slip each over to cook on the other side.

As they cook, remove the pancakes and keep them warm on a plate, and
covered with a cloth. When all the pancakes are cooked, serve them
hot with the cinnamon butter. "Lady MacDonald's Scotland: The Best of
