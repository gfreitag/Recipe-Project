Apples give a distinctive twist to this traditional Greek dessert.
Sauteing them first to let the water evaporate ensures a crisp crust.
APPLE LAYER: Peel and slice apples. Melt butter in Dutch oven over
high heat. Add apples, sugar and cinnamon; cook, stirring
occasionally, until apples are tender and juices are evaporated, 15
to 20 minutes. Cool. NUT MIXTURE: Combine all ingredients in small
bowl. Preheat oven to 400^F. Trim phyllo sheets to 13x9-inch
rectangles; cover with plastic wrap. Brush 13x9-inch metal baking pan
with butter. Place 1 phyllo sheet in pan and brush with some of the
melted butter (keep remaining phyllo covered). Layer 5 more phyllo
sheets on top, brushing each with butter. Spread 2 cups nut mixture
on top and repeat layering with 6 more phyllo sheets and butter.
Spread apple mixture on top; repeat layering with 6 more phyllo
sheets and butter. Sprinkle remaining nut mixture on top; sprinkle
with bread crumbs and layer with the 6 remaining phyllo sheets and
butter. With sharp knife, cut lengthwise through pastry and filling
into 1 1/2 inch-wide strips, then cut diagonally at 2-inch intervals
to make diamonds. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until golden. Drizzle
honey on top and bake 5 minutes more. Cool in pan on wire rack. Serve
warm or at room temperature with whipped or ice cream. Makes 12
servings.
