Butter a 9-inch-square baking dish. Sift the flour, salt, cinnamon,
nutmeg, and sugar into a bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces; cut
it into the flour mixture, using a pastry blender, until the mixture
resembles coarse crumbs. Cut the bread into 1-inch-square pieces.
Soak the raisins in boiling water to cover for about 5 minutes, until
plump, the drain them. Combine the bread, raisins, and sliced apples
in a bowl. Sprinkle the bottom of the prepared baking dish with 3/4
cup of the flour mixture, add the apple mixture, and top with the
remaining flour mixture. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until
the top of the brown betty is crisp and golden and the apples are
tender, 35 to 45 minutes. To make the rum whipped cream: In a chilled
medium bowl, beat the cream and sugar until stiff. Beat in the rum.
Serve the betty warm, with the rum whipped cream. Serves 6. Submitted
