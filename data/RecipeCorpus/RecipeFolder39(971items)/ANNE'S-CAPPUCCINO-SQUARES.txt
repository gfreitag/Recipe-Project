Preheat oven to 350F. FIRST LAYER: Grease 8 inch square cake pan with
butter. Mix together thoroughly flour, confectioner's sugar (icing
sugar), softened butter and coffee dissolved in hot water. (You can
use food processor or electric mixer). Press mixture evenly into pan
bottom. Bake 10 minutes in preheated 350F oven. Cool on wire rack.
SECOND LAYER: Meanwhile in large bowl, combine confectioner's sugar
(icing sugar), 1 Tbsp coffee crystals dissolved in 2 Tbsp hot water,
softened butter and 1 egg (lightly beaten with a fork at room
temperature.) Mix until thoroughly combined. (can use food processor
or electric mixer). Put milk in pot over medium heat and scald (heat
until bubbles appear around sides but milk is not a rolling boil).
Add mixture from bowl and heat 7 minutes over medium heat , stirring
frequently at first, constantly after the mixture bubbles. (If
mixture starts to stick on bottom, lower heat slightly). Let cool
slightly, then pour over first layer. Tilt pan to cover base layer
evenly. Chill in refrigerator half an hour or more till set. THIRD
LAYER: Combine 4 oz white chocolate with 1 Tbsp butter in double
boiler and melt (or melt 1 -1 1/2 minutes in microwave on High and
stir ). Spread over chilled second layer with spatula or blunt knife
(layer will be quite thin). OPTIONAL MARBLED EFFECT: Melt 2 oz
semisweet chocolate in double boiler (or in microwave 1 - 1 1/2
minutes on High and stir). Pour melted semisweet chocolate into small
ziploc bag and seal. Snip corner of bag with scissors. Squeeze out
horizontal lines of semisweet chocolate onto white chocolate layer.
With a blunt knife, swirl the two chocolates together to create a
marbled effect. Chill. Before the third layer is completely set,
score into bars. VARIATION: Mocha Squares: substitute semisweet
chocolate for white chocolate (this variation is easier as the middle
layer and semisweet chocolate are similar in colour.) MAKES: approx
32 bars (they are very sweet, therefore the bars should be small)
