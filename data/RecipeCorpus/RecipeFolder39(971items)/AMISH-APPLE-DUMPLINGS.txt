Title: AMISH APPLE DUMPLINGS
Categories: Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Apples, peeled and cored
Lemon juice
1/2 c  White sugar, approx
1 ts Cinnamon
Brown sugar
Butter
2    Pie pastry for 2 pies
Sugar sauce:
2 c  Water
3/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Vanilla
2 tb Butter
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Mace
Roll out pastry and cut into squares enough  to cover apples
completely. Peel and core apples.  Roll in lemon juice. Then roll in
white sugar and cinnamon combined. Place on pastry square. Stuff core
cavity with brown sugar, butter, brown sugar in equal parts. (The
amount depends on size of core cavity, just stuff full.) Fold pastry
up around apple to completely enclose it.  Place in pan. Prepare
sugar sauce by mixing water, sugar, vanilla, butter, nutmeg, and mace
and boiling for 1 minute. Let cool slightly.  Pour over Apples. Bake
in 375 F oven for 1 hour. Serve warm. Note:  Apples may be frozen in
pastry (before sugar sauce is added) if desired.  Good dessert to
make ahead if you have lots of apples around. Just let thaw when
ready to use, and cover with sugar sauce and bake as usual.
