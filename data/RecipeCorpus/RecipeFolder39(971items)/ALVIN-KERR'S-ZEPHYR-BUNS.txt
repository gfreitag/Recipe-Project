Title: ALVIN KERR'S ZEPHYR BUNS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 18 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
2 tb Warm water -- 100-115 deg.
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
3    Eggs
2 c  All-purpose flour -- sifted
1/4 c  Melted butter
1 ts Cool water
Soften the yeast in warm water and stir in the sugar and salt to
dissolve. In a bowl, beat 2 of the eggs and blend in the flour. Then
stir in the yeast mixture and melted butter. Knead vigorously in the
bowl with the hands till the dough leaves the sides of the bowl and
is elastic, about 5 minutes. Make into a ball, put in a buttered
bowl, and cover with plastic wrap.  Let rise in a warm, draft-free
place for 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk. Punch down and
divide into 18 equal pieces. Roll the pieces into balls and arrange,
well separated, on a buttered baking sheet. Let rise 30 minutes, or
until doubled in size. Brush with the remaining egg beaten with a
teaspoon of water.  Bake in a preheated oven at 375 degrees for 10
minutes, or until nicely browned. Cool on a rack. From Beard on Bread
by James Beard.
