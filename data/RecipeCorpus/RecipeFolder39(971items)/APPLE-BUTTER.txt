Title: APPLE BUTTER
Categories: Fruits, Jams
Yield: 12 Servings
3 qt Unsweetened Applesauce
2 lb Granulated Sugar
1 lb Brown Sugar
3/4 c  Apple Cider
MMMMM---------------------------SPICES--------------------------------
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Allspice

The thicker skinned, late Summer and Fall apples produce a grainier
texture that's best for applesauce.
Stir applesauce, sugars, and cider together and cook in a slow oven
(325 deg F.) for 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
Add spices. Return to oven and cook 1 hour more. Apple butter
requires long, slow cooking. (Can also be made in a crockpot.)
