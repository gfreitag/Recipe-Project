Title: APPLE WALNUT STUFFING
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 1 Recipes
8 c  Bread, cut into 1" cubes
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
1/2 c  Diced onion
1/4 c  Fresh parsley
2    Eggs
1 c  Chicken broth
1/4 ts Pepper
2    Peeled cored & diced apples
1 c  Chopped walnuts
Preheat your oven to 325 degrees.  Place bread cubes in a large
bowl. Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Chop the
parsley. Add celery, onion and parsley to the butter and cook,
stirring occasionally, until softened. This should take about five
minutes. Mix all this with the bread. Now beat the eggs. Mix eggs,
broth and pepper; add this to the bread and mix it all real well.
Stir in apples and walnuts. Bake in greased 2-quart dish for 25
minutes. If you like your stuffing a little crispy, go ahead and cook
it for a little longer. When it's done, serve it up! This one'll go
quick, and if your kin likes stuffing as much as mine, you may want
to double all the ingredients to make a little extra for the day
after! Submitted By RHOMMEL <RHOMMEL@IX.NETCOM.COM> On FRI, 1 DEC
