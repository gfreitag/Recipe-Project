Clean the beef heart thoroughly, removing all nerves and fat. Cut
into 1" cubes, place in non-reactive bowl, refrigerate and set aside.
Combine garlic, chiles, cumin, oregan, salt and pepper and 1 1/2
cups vinegar. Pour over meat. Add more vinegar, if necessary, to
cover meat completely. Marinate, refrigerated, 12-24 hours. About 1
hour before grilling, remove meat from marinade and thread on
skewers. Reserve marinade.
Soak the crushed chile in 1/3 cup warm water for 30 minutes. In
processor, combine chiles and water with oil and salt. Add enough
reserved marinade (3/4 cup) to make thick sauce, puree.
Brush skewered meat with sauce and grill over hot coals or under a
broiler, turning and basting to cook quickly on all sides. Best cooked
medium well, 4-6 minutes on the grill. Serve with remaining sauce for
dipping.
