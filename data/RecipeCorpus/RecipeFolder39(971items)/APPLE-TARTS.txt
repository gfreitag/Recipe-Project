Roll out the pastry 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured surface, cut
out two 7-inch rounds, and transfer them to a baking sheet. Peel,
halve lengthwise, and core the apple, slice it thin crosswise, and
arrange the slices, overlapping them slightly, on the pastry rounds.
In a small bowl stir together the sugar and the cinnamon, sprinkle
the mixture evenly over the apples, and dot the tarts with the
butter. Bake the tarts in the middle of a pre-heated 400 degree oven
for 25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Transfer the
tarts to a rack, brush them with the jam and serve them warm with ice
cream.
