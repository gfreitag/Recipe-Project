Title: AMISH SAUERKRAUT SOUP
Categories: Soups, Penndutch
Yield: 10 Servings
1 lb Smoked sausage (Kielbasa)
6 tb Onion; chopped
1/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Black pepper
3 c  Milk
1 c  Half-and-half
8 oz Sauerkraut, with juice
1 1/2 tb Lemon juice (optional)
2 tb Fresh parsley; chopped
Chop the sausage coarsely by hand or in a food processor (leave the
casing on).  Transfer the sausage and onion to a deep pan, and saute
over medium heat until the sausage is lightly browned, about 8
minutes.

On a small plate combine the flour, thyme, and pepper. Add to the
sausage and brown all together until the mixture bubbles up, about 5
minutes. Add the milk and the half-and-half all at once, and cook
stirring until the mixture again bubbles up, about 5 minutes.  Add
the sauerkraut and it juice and bring to a boil; the mixture will
continue to thicken. Taste for tartness, and lemon juice if desired.
Add the parsley and serve at once. From Cooking from Quilt Country by
