Categories: Diabetic, Poultry, Vegetables, Crockpot
Yield: 8 Servings
1/2    Stewing hen or fowl;
2 qt Chicken stock or broth
1/4 c  Onion; coarsely chopped
1/2 c  Carrots; coarsely chopped
1/2 c  Celery; coarsely chopped;
1 ts Saffron threads; (optional)
3/4 c  Corn kernels; (fresh/frozen)
1/2 c  Celery; finely chopped

Combine stewing hen with chicken stock, coarsely chopped onions,
carrots, celery, and saffron threads.  Bring the stock to a simmer.
Simmer for about 1 hour, skimming the surface as necessary.Remove and
reserve the stewing hen until cool enough to handle; then pick the
meat from the bones. Cut into neat little pieces. Strain the saffron
broth through a fine sieve. (Note: The soup can be made through this
step in advance.  Simply refrigerate broth and diced chicken meat for
2 to 3 days, or freeze the broth and the chicken meat in separate
convenient sized containers. Be sure to label and date them.  To use,
defrost, remove congealed fat, return the broth full boil, and add
the diced meat. Continue with recipe.) Add the corn, celery, parsley,
and cooked noodles to the broth. Return the soup to a simmer and
serve immediately.
