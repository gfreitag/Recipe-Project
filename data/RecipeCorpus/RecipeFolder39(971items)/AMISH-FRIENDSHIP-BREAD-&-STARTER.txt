FRIENDSHIP STARTER:

Day 1:  Make the starter dough using 1 cup sugar, 1 cup flour, and 1
cup milk.  Stir the mixture.  Do not use metal spoons or mixers. Use
a glass or plastic bowl. Cover the bowl loosely with a paper towel,
cloth, waxed paper or plastic wrap.  Do not refrigerate the mixture.
Keep at room temperature.

Days 2,3,4:  Stir the mixture down once each day with a wooden or
plastic spoon.

Day 5:  Add 1 cup each of sugar, flour and milk.  Stir.

Days 6,7,8,9:  Stir once each day.

Day 10:  Add 1 cup each of sugar, flour and milk. Remove 3 cups of the
mixture and give 1 cup each to three friends to make Amish Friendship
Bread.

BREAD:  Mix all the ingredients well with a wooden spoon. Pour into 2
well-greased and sugared bread loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees for
40-45 minutes. This freezes very well. Great to give as a gift. NOTE:
Raisins, chopped apples, drained crushed pineapple, dates, chopped
nuts or chocolate chips may be added to the batter before pouring
into the pans. Use 3/4 cup of whatever you desire to add.
