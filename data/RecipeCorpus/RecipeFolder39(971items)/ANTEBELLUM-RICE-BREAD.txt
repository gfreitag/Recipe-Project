Title: ANTEBELLUM RICE BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 tb Melted butter
1/2 tb Melted shortening
1 c  Cooked rice
1/2 c  Cornmeal
1 ts Salt *
1 ds Cayenne pepper (optional)
1 c  Milk
3    Eggs, beaten
This one is from The Bread Winners Cookbook by Mel London.

This recipe was given to me by an old friend in Savannah, who told me
that it was a favorite breakfast bread on the plantations.

* The salt, though traditional, may be eliminated if you choose to do
so.

Place the melted fats and the rice in a heavy saucepan, covered, over
very low heat.  Mix cornmeal and salt and pepper, then stir milk into
beaten eggs and blend in the cornmeal. Blend together with the rice
mixture and put into greased 8- or 9-inch square pan.

Bake at 450 deg.F. until firm when tapped with finger and well
browned on top--about 25 minutes.

Cut into squares to serve.

Makes 1 to 1 1/2 dozen squares.

NOTE:  This just looked like an interesting combination... and like
something that would create a little more (or different) texture.. a
fun bread.  It almost sounds like it might come out a custardy
bread...
