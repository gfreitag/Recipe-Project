well. For those of you that don't have one, you may have to adapt this
recipe for use with other machines... or your own proceedures for
making iced tea... CF

Slice the apples into thin slices and remove the cores and
1)
seeds... place Â« of the slices in the steeping pot... 2) Mix the
cinnamon and the sugar until it is uniform in color... then sprinkle
it over the apple slices in the steeping pot... 3) Follow the
directions to make Iced tea that came with the machine... add the
teabags to the steeping pot on top of the apples... Add the remaining
apple slices to the pitcher on top of the ice... assemble the machine
and the pitcher and turn it on... 4) add the apple slices from the
steeping pot to the pitcher when the tea is done along with more ice
to fill the pitcher... stir vigorously and serve...
