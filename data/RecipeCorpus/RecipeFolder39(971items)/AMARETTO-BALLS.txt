Title: AMARETTO BALLS
Categories: Desserts, Christmas, Gainesville
Yield: 4 Dozen
2 c  Pecans, chopped finely
2 c  Confectioner's sugar, sifted
2 c  Chocolate wafer crumbs
2/3 c  Amaretto
Pecans, additional
Process pecans and wafers separately; combine in food processor with
sugar. SLOWLY pour in liqueur until mixture forms a ball. You might
not need the whole amount, depending on the humidity level. (If
mixture gets too wet, put it in the refrigerator -- uncovered --
overnight to dry out some.)

Shape into small balls; roll in additional finely chopped pecans.
Store in tightly sealed container. Yield: Not nearly enough.

Vicki's notes:

*  One Christmas Eve I had to work, but I took a break to pop in a
bookstore.  They were having an open house, and I managed to snarf a
lot of these morsels during those stolen minutes! After Christmas I
came back to hunt down the clerk who brought these -- my finest bit
of sleuthing yet...

*  These are equally enjoyed and requested by my friends. Although
some have tried other liqueurs -- including bourbon -- the results
are never as good as the original!

*  I substitute Oreos for the wafers, plus use only 1 1/3 C confec
sugar; don't worry about the cookies' filling because it is nothing
more than confec sugar.
