Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/3 c  Margarine
1 sm Apple, peeled and cored
1 c  Quick-cooking rolled oats
2    Egg whites
2 tb Apple juice or skim milk

Combine the flours, baking powder, and cinnamon in a bowl. Cut in the
margarine until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Chop the apple.
Stir in the apple and rolled oats. Add the egg whites, apple juice or
milk, and honey; mix well.  The dough will be sticky.

Spray a baking sheet with nonstick coating.  Pat dough into a 7-inch
circle on the baking sheet with floured hands. Use a long,
thin-bladed spatula to cut into 12 wedges. Separate the wedges,
leaving 1/4 inch between them. Brush with a little skim milk. Bake in
a 400 F oven until golden, 10 to 12 minutes.  Serve warm.

Makes 12 scones.

except stir 1 teaspoon finely shredded orange peel into the flour
mixture and substitute 1/2 cup currants for the apple and 3
tablespoons orange juice for the apple juice.  Shape and bake as
directed.
