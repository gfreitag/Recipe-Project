Cut each glove into 2 sections, making a straight cut through the palm
between the middle & ring finger. Start with 3 fingered sections. Turn
inside out. Stitch the cut edges together. Turn right side out. Stuff
fingers with fiberfill, making sure they are packed tight & leaving a
short section at the cuff unstuffed. Wrap cuff tightly around
headband. Pin in place to the stuffed part of the glove. Using double
thread, stitch the cuff to the glove, pulling thread tightly so
antlers stand up. Repeat with other glove. Paint. Make bows from
ribbons & stitch onto base of antlers. Stitch a few bells in center
of bows. Submitted By THESERVS@GATE.NET (THOMAS E. HAUG)  On TUE, 14
