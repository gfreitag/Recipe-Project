Title: ANDOUILLE A LA JEANNINE
Categories: Cajun, Appetizers
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Dry white wine
2 lb Andouille or smoked sausage
2 tb Honey
1 tb Creole mustard
Slice andouille 1/4-to 1/2-inch thick.  Mix all liquid ingredients
and pour over andouille in a covered skillet. Cook over low heat
untill andouille is tender. Andouille is gumbo sausage for all you
peoples who live away from the center of the universe.  You can use
other sausage and it would taste okay. Justin Wilson "Gourmet and
