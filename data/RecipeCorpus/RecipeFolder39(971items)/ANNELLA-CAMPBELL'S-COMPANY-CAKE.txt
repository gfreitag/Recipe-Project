PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F with rack in center of oven. Generously grease 2
8-inch layer cake pans. Dust with flour, tapping pans over sink to
remove excess flour. FOR CAKE, sift flour, baking powder and salt
together onto waxed paper; set aside. Use mixer to cream shortening
and sugar until fluffy. Add egg yolks one at a time, beating well
after each addition. Add vanilla. Combine well. Add reserved flour
mixture alternately with milk, mixing until smooth. Divide batter
between prepared pans. Use back of spoon to spread batter evenly;
this takes a little patience. FOR MERINGUE, beat egg whites until
they are thick and hold their shape but are still soft and moist. Add
sugar by the tablespoon, beating well after each addition. Divide
between pans. Use spatula to spread over batter. Sprinkle with nuts,
dividing evenly. Bake until lightly colored and toothpick inserted
into center comes out clean (it's OK if meringue cracks), about 30
minutes. Let rest 10 minutes in pans on cooling racks. Use flexible
knife to release cake from sides of pan. Gently invert cakes. Set
them meringue-side up to cool completely. Spread one meringue layer
with filling. Top with other layer, meringue-side up. It's best
served the day it is made but it can be made a day ahead and kept
cool (but not refrigerated). If made ahead, keep covered. Yield: 1
8-inch layer cake. VANILLA CUSTARD FILLING: Combine sugar, cornstarch
and salt in heavy 1-quart saucepan. Stir in egg yolk and milk. Stir
over medium heat. Stir until mixture coats spoon, about 4 minutes.
Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla. Let cool completely. If mixture
becomes lumpy, whisk vigorously, before using.
