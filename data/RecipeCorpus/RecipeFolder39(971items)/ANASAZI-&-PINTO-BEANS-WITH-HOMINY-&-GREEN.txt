Categories: Main dish, Stews, Casseroles, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 c  Dried anasazi beans
1 1/2 c  Dried pinto beans
10 c  Water
1 ts Salt
3 c  Dried indian hominy
3 ea Green anaheim chiles
Soak the beans overnight in water to cover.  In the morning rinse the
beans with cold water and place in a large pot with fresh water to
cover. Stir in the salt, cover and simmer slowly 2 to 2 1/2 hours,
until the beans are tender.  Add water when necessary and stir
occasionally to prevent the beans from burning. Add hominy and
simmer, covered, 1 hour, stirring occasionally.  The hominy and beans
should be very soft and moist, but not too watery. While the beans
and hominy are cooking, roast, peel, seed and dice the chiles.
Sprinkle on top of the cooked beans for garnish.
