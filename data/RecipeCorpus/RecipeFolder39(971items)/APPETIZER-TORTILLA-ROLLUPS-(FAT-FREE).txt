Categories: Appetizers, Mexican
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Flour tortillas; jumbo
-sized, fat-free
2 pk Cream cheese; fat-free
1 cn Rotel tomatoes with chilies;
- drained
4 ea Green onions; finely chopped
Mix the cream cheese, rotel tomatoes w/chilies and green onions to
make a paste...you may need a little of the juice drained from the
rotel, so reserve it just in case.

Spread the mixture about 1/4 inch thick on tortillas. Refrigerate for
about an hour before slicing.  For Christmas, you can also tint the
mixture with food coloring.

Serve with salsa, or if you are not worried about fat grams, queso.
