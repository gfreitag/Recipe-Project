Title: APPLE JUICE
Categories: Beverages, Canning
Yield: 1 Guide  Quality: Good quality apple juice is made from a blend of varieties.
For best results, buy fresh juice from a local cider maker within 24
hours after it has been pressed.

Procedure: Refrigerate juice for 24 to 48 hours. Without mixing,
carefully pour off clear liquid and discard sediment. Strain clear
liquid through a paper coffee filter or double layers of damp
cheesecloth.

Heat quickly, stirring occasionally, until juice begins to boil. Fill
immediately into sterile pint or quart jars or fill into clean
half-gallon jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process.
