4 lg Apples; tart, sliced
4 tb Butter; or margarine
6    Eggs; beaten
1 c  Flour
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
Saute apples and butter until apples are slightly soft and light
golden brown.  Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, mix eggs, flour, sugar
and vanilla. Pour over sauteed apples and bake in 375~ oven for about
15 minutes until custard mixture is nearly done. Remove from oven and
top with generous dollops of butter, granulated sugar, and cinnamon.
Return to oven for five minutes to melt butter and set custard.
Serve hot with heated maple syrup.  Freezes and reheats in microwave
beautifully.

This is a delicious brunch offering all year long, but is especially
great in apple season.  Chuck in Pok.
