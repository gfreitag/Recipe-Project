[Editor's Note:  this may just be corn syrup, like Karo's] In a
large bowl, stir together the flour, oats, coconut, sugar, and baking
powder. In a small saucepan, combine the butter and syrup and cook
the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring, until the butter is
melted. Pour the butter mixture into the flour mixture and combine
the batter well. Drop heaping tablespoons of the batter 2 inches
apart onto a buttered baking sheet and flatten them slightly with the
back of a fork dipped in water. Bake the cookies in the middle of a
preheated 300F degree oven for 15 minutes, or until they are golden.
Let the cookies cool slightly on the baking sheet, transfer them with
a spatula to a rack and let them cool completely.
