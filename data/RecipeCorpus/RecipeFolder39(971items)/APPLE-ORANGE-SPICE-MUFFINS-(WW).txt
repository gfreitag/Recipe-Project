Categories: Low cal/fat, Breads
3/4 c  flour
Yield: 12 Servings
1 1/2 t  baking powder
1/2 t  cinnamon
1/4 t  baking soda
1    dash salt
1/3 c  instant nonfat dry milk
2 T  margarine
1 T  brown sugar
1    large egg
2    apple
2 T  raisins -------------------------Plus 1 tsp. frozen.
concentrate-------------------
1 T  apple juice
1    orange peel
1    dash cream of tartar

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Into small bowl sift together flour,
baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and cloves; stir
in milk powder and set aside. In mixing bowl cream margarine with
sugar; add egg yolk and, using electric mixer on medium speed, beat
until thick and creamy. Add apples, raisins, juice, and orange peel
and stir to combine; add flour mixture and beat until well blended.
In separate bowl, using clean beaters and mixer on high speed, beat
egg white with cream of tartar until stiff but not dry; fold into
batter. Spray eight 2 1/2 inch diameter nonstick muffin pan cups with
nonstick cooking spray; spoon 1/8 of batter into each sprayed cup
(each will be about 2/3 full) and partially fill remaining cups with
water (this will prevent pan from burning and/or warping). Bake 20 to
25 minutes (until cake tester, inserted in center, comes out clean).
Remove pan from oven and carefully drain off water (remember, it will
be boiling hot); remove muffins to wire rack and let cool. Makes 4
servings of 2 MUFFINS EACH!
