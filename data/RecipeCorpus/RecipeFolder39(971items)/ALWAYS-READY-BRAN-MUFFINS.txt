Title: ALWAYS READY BRAN MUFFINS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Muffins
3 c  Unprocessed wheat bran
1 c  ;Water, boiling
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Margarine
2    Eggs
2 1/2 c  Flour, unbleached
2 1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
2 c  Buttermilk
Raisins (opt.)
Pecans (opt.)
*    I use whole wheat flour and add water to the recipe.

Put 1 c of the wheat bran in a small bowl.  Add the boiling water,
stir once and let stand to soften.

Cream the margarine and sugar in a mixing bowl.   Beat the eggs
slightly and add to the margarine mixture, mixing well.

Combine the flour soda and salt in a mixing bowl. Combine the wheat
bran, the softened bran, and the flour mixture, and then combine with
the egg/margarine/sugar mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Stir
until thoroughly mixed.

Pour into a plastic container with a tight lid.  Store in the
refrigerator for a minimum of 12 hours and a maximum of 6 weeks.
Makes 2 dozen.

These muffins are made, stored in the refrigerator, and baked
whenever they are wanted.  About 25 minutes before serving, preheat
the oven to 400 degrees F. Spoon the batter into teflon-lined or
buttered muffin tins, filling them 2/3 full.  Bake 18 minutes and
serve.

I like to add rasins and pecans to the muffin tins before cooking.
