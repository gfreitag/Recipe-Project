Fellow fire fighters beg Mr. Pernicone to make his fullbodied
prosciutto sauce. Serve it over a pound or so of your favorite
macaroni.

1. Warm the oil in a nonreactive large pot over medium heat. Add the
garlic and onion and cook until the onion is translucent, 5 minutes.
Add the prosciutto and cook for 5 minutes. Add the juice from the
tomatoes. Using your hands or a fork, break up the whole tomatoes and
add to the pot. Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes.

2. Stir in the basil, parsley, wine and pepper flakes, season with
salt and pepper to taste, and simmer for 1 hour.

3. Remove the sauce from the heat. Whisk in the butter until melted.

Makes 3 1/2 cups, serves 4.

From the Oregonian's FOODday, 1/26/93.
