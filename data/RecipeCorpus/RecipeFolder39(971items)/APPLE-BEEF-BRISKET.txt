Place brisket, the yellow onion, chopped garlic and garlic cloves in a
large Dutch oven.  Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce
heat, cover and simmer 2 1/2 hours or until the brisket is tender.
Drain brisket. (If you wish, you could keep the brisket covered with
the cooking liquid and refrigerate it overnight. This will help
prepare for the next day.) In a small saucepan, mix together the
apple jelly, wine, mustard, green onions, salt, pepper, and curry
powder. Heat until the jelly melts.

Place brisket in a shallow roasting pan and brush some of the jelly
mixture over the top.  Bake at 325 degrees F. for 45 minutes, basting
3 or 4 times with the remaining jelly mixture. Remove the meat to a
platter to keep warm.  Place the pan over 2 burners and add apple
juice, stirring to scrape up browned bits on bottom of pan. Bring to
a boil over medium-high heat. Boil, stirring, until slightly
thickened and reduced by about half. Pour into a gravy boat. Slice
meat and garnish with the parsley. Serve with gravy.  Makes 8 servings
