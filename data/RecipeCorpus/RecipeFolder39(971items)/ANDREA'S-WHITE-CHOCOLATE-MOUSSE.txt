Title: ANDREA'S WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
Categories: Pudding
Yield: 1 Serving
1 lb White chocolate
1 c  Whipping cream
3    Eggs; separated
1/4 c  Brandy
1/4 c  Hot water
1 tb Vanilla
2 oz Sugar
Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over medium-low heat. It's a
good idea to stand over the chocolate while it's melting and stir
until it has melted completely; take it off the heat immediately.

Whip the cream and set aside.

Pour the brandy and hot water slowly into a bowl with the egg yolks,
whisking briskly as you go until completely mixed. Whisk in the melted
chocolate. Keep whisking even after the mixture is completely
combined; this will help cool the chocolate.

Whip the egg whites and the sugar, adding the vanilla as you beat,
until peaking but not dry. Fold the egg-white meringue into the
chocolate mixture carefully with a wooden spoon. Fold in the whipped
cream. This is the most critical part of the recipe. The key to a
great chocolate mousse is incorporating cooled chocolate into whipped
cream. The chocolate must be cool to the touch or the cream will
separate. Lightly blend the two mixtures until uniform.

The mousse is actually at its best texture as soon as mixed.
