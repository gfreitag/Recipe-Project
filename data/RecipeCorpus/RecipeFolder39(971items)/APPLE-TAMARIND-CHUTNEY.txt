-peeled, cored and cut into
-chunks
2    Onions; chopped
1 1/4 c  Packed light brown sugar
3/4 c  Cider vinegar
3/4 c  Golden raisins

1 tb Tamarind concentrate or
2 ts Molasses mixed with
1 ts Fresh lime juice
1 tb Fresh ginger; minced
1 tb Mustard seed
1/2 ts Fenugreek seed (optional)
1/2 ts Salt
1    Cinnamon stick
1    Bay leaf
In a large heavy bottomed saucepan, combine apples, onions, brown
sugar, vinegar, raisins, jalapenos, tamarind concentrate or molasses
with lime juice, ginger, mustard seed, fenugreek seed (if using),
salt, cinnamon stick and bay leaf.  Bring to a simmer over low heat
and cook, stirring occasionally, until apples are tender and the
chutney is thick, about 30 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.
Remove cinnamon stick and bay leaf. Transfer to clean jars (the
chutney will keep about 2 months in the refrigerator). Alternatively,
pack hot chutney into half pint jars, leaving 1/2 inch of headspace.
Seal with canning lids and process for 10 minutes in a boiling water
bath. Store jars in a cool dry place. Makes about 3 cups.
