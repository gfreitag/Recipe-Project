*** TO MAKE THE FRICASSEE ***

* - cut into bite-sized pieces.

1. Melt the butter in a large, heavy saucepan or deep skillet and
stir in the flour. When bubbly, slowly add the heated chicken stock,
stirring. Add cream and continue to cook, stirring until sauce is
thick. Add chicken meat and cook, stirring a final 5-10 minutes.

2. Southerners usually serve fricassee over cooked white rice, but it
is also great over baking-powder biscuits with a thin slice of baked
ham placed on each biscuit half before the fricassee is spooned over.
