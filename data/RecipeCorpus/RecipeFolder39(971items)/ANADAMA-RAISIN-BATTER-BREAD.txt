Title: ANADAMA RAISIN BATTER BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
1 c  Milk
1 c  Water
1 c  Corn meal, preferably yellow
-and stone-ground
3 tb Sweet butter
1/2 c  Molasses
1/2 c  Warm water
2 tb Dry yeast
1/2 ts Sugar or honey
2 ts Salt
5 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
-(approx)
1 c  Gold raisins
Makes 2 loaves.

IN a good-sized saucepan bring the milk and 1 cup water to a boil.
Turn off the heat and sprinkle in the corn meal, stirring
energetically with a wire whisk or fork. Add the butter and molasses
and stir until evenly mixed. Cool to lukewarm.

In a large mixing bowl dissolve the yeast in the half-cup warm water
with the sugar or honey.  When bubbly, add cornmeal mixture, salt,
and 2 1/2 cups of the flour. It should be thick but still beatable.
Beat 5 minutes with an electric mixer.

Stir in the raisins.  Gradually add 2/12 to 3 cups more flour,
beating with a large spoon until the battter is too stiff to continue
beating and holds together in a mass in the center of the bowl.

Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let it sit until the dough has
risen to twice its original volume. Stir down with the spoon. If you
wish, let it rise a second time. Stir down. Divide the dough between
two buttered large loaf pans.  Be sure you get equal amounts in each
pan. Squish it into the corners with your fingers. Press to smooth
the tops a bit; don't worry if they look like a lava flow.

Cover the pans with a towel and let rise until batter reaches the
tops of the pans.  Preheat oven to 350F. Bake 40 - 45 minutes, until
the loaves are brown but don't quite have a hollow sound when tapped
on the bottoms. Remove them from the pans and put directly on the
oven rack. Bake another 5 minutes to crisp the crust.

Cool on a rack.
