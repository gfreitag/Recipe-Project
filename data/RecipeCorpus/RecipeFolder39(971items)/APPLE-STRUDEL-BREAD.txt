surface, roll dough into a 12x24-inch rectangle.  Brush dough with
the softened margarine.

For filling, in a small mixing bowl, combine apples, brown sugar,
raisins, 3 to 4 teaspoons flour, and cinnamon.  Beginning about 2
inches from a long side, spoon filling in a 3-inch-wide band across
dough. Starting from the long side, carefully roll up dough; pinch
edges and ends to seal. Carefully transfer to prepared baking pan,
curving dough to fit and form a crescent shape.  Cover and let rise
in warm place about 45 minutes ot till nearly double.

Bake in a 350ÂºF oven for 30 to 35 minutes or till brown; cover with
foil for the last 10 to 15 miutes to prevent overbrowning, if
necessary. Remove from pan.  Cool on a rack.  Serves 20.

FOR ICING: In a small mixing bowl stir together powdered sugar and 1
to 3 teaspoons milk.  Add enough milk to make an icing of drizzling
consistency. Drizzle over strudel.
