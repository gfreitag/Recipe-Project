I had some modifications: I omitted the celery (Yuck!) I omitted the
pepperoncini peppers (Yuck!) I doubled the artichoke hearts (Yum!!) I
used large mushrooms sliced, since there weren't small ones at the
store I had no Italian seasoning, so I used about a tablespoon of
oregano and a tablespoon of basil, and it worked out fine. I
increased the olive oil by about a teaspoon.

You could use a light cheese tortellini or a different type of
tortellini, or even bow-tie pasta or something, to lessen the fat
content. This tasted the best after it had marinated for about 2 days.
