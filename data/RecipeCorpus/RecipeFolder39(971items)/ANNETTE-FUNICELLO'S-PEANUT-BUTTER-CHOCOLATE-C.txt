[I made these last night to pack for my trip to Reno. Whatever you do,
don't use creamy peanut butter!  With just 1/2 cup nut butter mixed
with 2 cups flour, the nut taste gets kind of lost. I used almond
butter; we also used Cantbelieveitsnotbutter for the margarine. Don't
round those Tbspfulls too high, as these cookies wind up a bit on the
large size. I also forgot about flattening them out; oh well... What
I have are chocolate chip cookies (mini-chips), with a faint almond
flavor.]

please let me know!  I'll be staying at the Peppermill hotel for
about 2 weeks, and may be able to modem out...]
