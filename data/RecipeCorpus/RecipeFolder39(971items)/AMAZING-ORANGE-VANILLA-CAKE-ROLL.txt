Prep: 30 minutes.  Bake: 20 minutes.  Total cost: $3.95. The cake
bakes right on top of the filling, which is then rolled up inside.
The cake can be baked up to 1 week ahead.

Preheat oven to 375 F.  Lightly grease 15-1/2"x10-1/2" jelly roll
pan. Line bottom and sides with waxed paper; grease paper.

Filling: Beat cream cheese and sugar with electric mixer until
smooth. Beat in eggs, milk, and vanilla JUST until blended. Spread
evenly in lined pan.

Cake: Beat eggs, sugar, orange peel, and vanilla in large bowl with
electric mixer on high speed 8-12 minutes, until very thick, pale,
and at least tripled in volume. (Eggs are the only leavening in this
cake, so it is very important to beat them to maximum volume. Use a
large, deep, narrow bowl rather than a wide one. An 8-cup glass
measure is perfect.) Sprinkle with flour. Fold until just blended.
Add butter and fold until just blended. Spread evenly over filling in
pan. Bake 19-21 minutes, until cake springs back when touched in
center.

While cake bakes, spread clean kitchen towel (not paper or terry
cloth) on countertop.  Sift powdered sugar through small strainer
over towel, covering an area the size of the cake.

Invert hot cake onto towel.  Remove pan and carefully peel off paper.
Starting at one narrow end, neatly roll up cake, using towel as an
aid. Cool completely on wire rack. Wrap and refrigerate up to 1 week.
When ready to serve, garnish with candied citrus slices.

Candied citrus slices: choose fruit with thin skin for best results.
We used three varieties to vary size of slices. Use leftovers to
garnish other desserts or as an accompaniment to ham or poultry.

Scrub skins.  Slice in 18"-thick rounds.  Bring water and sugar to
boil in wide skillet.  Add one citrus type at a time in a single
layer. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered 20-40 minutes, until
translucent. Remove to bowl with slotted spoon; repeat with remaining
fruit. Pour syrup over slices; add a little water if syrup is too
thick. Refrigerate up to 3 months.
