Title: ANISE-ALMOND BISCOTTI
Categories: Cookies and, New imports
Yield: 1 Servings
3/4 c  Whole almonds
2 1/4 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Butter -- softened
1/4 c  Sugar
2    Eggs -- lightly beaten
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 tb Anise seeds
To toast almonds, preheat oven to 350=B0F. Spread almonds in a single
layer on a baking sheet and toast, turning occasionally, for 10
minutes. Set aside to cool, then roughly chop. Sift together flour,
baking powder and salt in a small mixing bowl. Set aside. Cream
butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large mixing bowl until
fluffy; then beat in eggs and vanilla. Gradually add flour mixture,
mix until combined, then stir in chopped almonds and anise seeds.
Dough will be stiff. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work
surface, then, using your hands or a rolling pin, shape into one long
roll, about 3 inches by 13 inches. Line baking sheet with parchment
paper or aluminum foil (shiny side up). Transfer dough roll to baking
sheet, flatten slightly, then bake until golden brown, about 35
minutes. Remove from oven--do not turn oven off--and set aside until
cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Using a serrated knife, cut
roll, on the diagonal, into 1/2 inch thick slices. Place slices flat
on baking sheet and bake, turning once, until golden brown, about 5
minutes per side. Do not over bake: Biscotti will feel soft in the
middle but will become crisp and hard as they cool. Allow to cool
completely on pan. Biscotti will keep in a sealed container for up to
4 weeks. Makes about 2 dozen
