Sweet apples and salty bread provide an intriguing contrast in taste.
To ensure that the hearth bread remains light and crisp, keep the
dough soft: Don't work in too much flour and knead it gently.

Makes 1 loaf (6 servings)

1. In large bowl of heavy-duty electric mixer, combine 1 1/2 cups
flour, the yeast, and salt. Slowly beat in water, 1/4 cup olive oil,
and the honey; vigorously beat mixture 10 minutes. Cover bowl with
clean cloth and let dough rise in warm place, away from drafts, 40
minutes.

2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt butter. Add apple slices and
saute' until very lightly browned; set aside.

3. After dough has risen 40 minutes, turn out onto floured surface.
Gently knead in as much of remaining 1/4 cup flour as necessary to
form a very soft dough - about 1 minute. Gently work apple slices
into the dough.

4. Lightly oil large baking sheet. With floured fingers, shape dough
into a 9 inch round on oiled sheet. Cover with clean cloth and let
rise in warm place, away from drafts, until double in size - about
30    minutes.

5. Heat oven to 400 degrees F. With pastry brush, coat top of dough
round with 2 tablespoons olive oil; sprinkle with coarse salt, if
desired. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until hearth bread is browned.

6. Drizzle hearth bread with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and
serve warm.
