Categories: Pies, Diabetic
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb McIntosh apples, peeled,
-and thinly sliced (7 cups)
2 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Butter Buds Sprinkles
4 pk Sweet'N Low
-(or 1-1/4 ts bulk)
1 tb All-purpose flour
1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/8 ts Ground allspice
4    Sheets phyllo dough, thawed
Nonfat frozen vanilla yogurt
-optional
Preheat the oven to 375 F. Spray a 9-inch pie pan with nonstick
cooking spray.

In a large bowl, toss the apples with the lemon juice. In a small
bowl, combine the sugar, Butter Buds, Sweet'N Low, flour, cinnamon
and allspice. Add to the apples and toss to coat. Lightly spray one
sheet of phyllo dough with nonstick cooking spray. Fold in half and
spray again. Place in the pie pan with one edge hanging over the pan.
Repeat the process with the remaining 3 sheets of dough, overlapping
in the pan to cover the bottom completely. Spoon the apple mixture
into the pan. Fold the edges of the dough over to cover the apples.
Spray with nonstick cooking spray. Bake 35 minutes, or until the
dough is crisp and the apples are tender when pierced with a sharp
knife. Cool slightly before serving.

Serve with nonfat frozen vanilla yogurt, if desired.

Variation: Seven cups of sliced fresh peaches or pears, or fresh
blueberries, may be substituted for the apples. (Makes 1 9-inch pie,
8    servings)
