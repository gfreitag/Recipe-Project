Title: APPLE BREAD PUDDING
Categories: Desserts, Low-fat
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  Nonfat milk
3/4 c  Maple syrup
1 tb Ground cinnamon
1 c  Egg whites (6-8 eggs)
4 c  Diced bread
2 c  Apple, peeled, cored and
Diced
1 c  Raisins
Preheat the oven to 350F.  In a large bowl, combine the milk, maple
syrup, and cinnamon.  In another bowl, beat the egg whites until
frothy. Add the egg whites to the milk mixture and stir to combine
thoroughly. Add the bread and toss well.  Set aside to soak for 30
minutes. Fold in the diced apples and raisins and pour into a
nonstick or lightly oiled 8x12x2" baking dish. Bake for 45-50
minutes, or until the top is very brown and crisp. A knife inserted
into the middle should come out clean at this point. Serve warm or at
room temperature.
