Title: AMERICAN GARLIC & PARSLEY BREAD - MACHINE
Categories:
Yield: 12 Servings
1 1/2 ts Active dry yeast
2 tb Sugar
3 c  Bread flour
2 tb Vegetable oil
3 tb Wheat germ
2    Garlic cloves -- minced
3 tb Wheat bran
3 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1 3/4 ts Salt
1 1/4 c  Water
Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine
manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the
manufacturer's directions.  For DAK/Welbilt, use White bread setting.
Let the loaf cool before slicing.  Serve plain or toasted. "This is
good bread for a steak sandwich, French dip roast beef, or a grilled
mozzarella cheese and tomato sandwich.  Baking the garlic right in
the bread lightens the garlic flavor. If this is not a strong enough
garlic statement for you, add another clove. From: The Best Bread
