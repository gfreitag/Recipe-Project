Title: APPLE PLATE CAKE(SCOTTISH)
Categories: Cakes, Scottish
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz SR flour
4 oz Butter
2 oz Caster sugar
4    Cooking apples
1    Egg, beaten
Little milk
Melted butter for glazing
Ground cloves or cinnamon
Caster sugar for dusting
Set oven to 425F or Mark 7. Grease an 8 inch round flan tin. Rub the
butter into the flour in a bowl and stir in the sugar. Peel and grate
two of the apples and add to the flour with the beaten egg. Mix well
together. If the dough is rather firm add a little milk to soften.
Turn the dough on to a floured surface and knead lightly. Press
evenly into the base of the tin. Peel, core and slice the remaining
apples and arrange, neatly overlapping, on top of the dough. Brush
with melted butter and sprinkle with a pinch of ground cloves or
cinnamon and a little caster sugar. Bake for 25-30 minutes and serve
warm.
