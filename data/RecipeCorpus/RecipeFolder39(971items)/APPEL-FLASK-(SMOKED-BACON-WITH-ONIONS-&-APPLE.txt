Title: APPEL-FLASK (SMOKED BACON WITH ONIONS & APPLE
Categories: Sweden, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Butter
1 lb Canadian bacon
2 lg Red tart cooking apples;
-unpeeled, cored & cut into
-1/2" thick rings
2 lg Onions; thinly sliced
Fresh ground pepper
Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy skillet. When foam subsides
add the bacon. Fry 5 to 10 minutes or until the bacon is lightly
browned. Remove from skillet and set on paper towels to drain. Fry
the onion slices for 6 to 8 minutes in the fat remaining in the
skillet, adding more butter as necessary. When the onions are soft
and transparent, add the apple rings and cover the pan. Simmer over
low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, shaking the pan gently at intervals to
prevent the apples from sticking. When the apple rings are
sufficiently cooked (they should offer little or no resistence when
pierced with the tip of a sharp knife or skewer), return the drained
bacon to the skillet. Cover and simmer an additional 3 to 5 minutes
or until the bacon is heated through. Grind fresh black pepper
liberally over the top and serve directly from the pan as a luncheon
entrÂ‚e or Sunday night supper.
