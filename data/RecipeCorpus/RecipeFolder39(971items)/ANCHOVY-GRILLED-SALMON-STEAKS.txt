Pre-heat the grill to high heat.  Oil the grill rack and place each
steak to ensure an even heat.  Place a small knob of Anchovy Butter
(divide a quarter of the mixture in four) on each steak. Grill for 4
minutes.

Turn the steaks with a fish slice and place another quarter of the
butter among the steaks.  Grill on the second side 4 minutes. Reduce
the heat and allow to cook for a further 3 minutes, less if the
steaks are thin.

Serve with a neatly arranged pat of anchovy butter on top of each
steak. Garnish with parsley sprigs and lemon wedges.

Anchovy Butter: Soak all the anchovy fillets in milk. Mash in a bowl
with a wooden spoon until creamy. Cream all ingredients together and
chill.

Serves 4.
