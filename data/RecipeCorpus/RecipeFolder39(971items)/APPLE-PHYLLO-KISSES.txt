In a small bowl, combine apples, lemon juice, cheddar cheese, and
chives. Set aside. Preheat oven to 375' F. Cut each sheet of phyllo
in half lengthwise and into fourths crosswise, forming 32 6 x 4-inch
squares. Lay 1 square of phyllo on a sheet of waxed paper. Brush
lightly with melted butter.  Repeat with 2 more squares of phyllo.
Place 2 tablespoons of filling in center. Bring up opposite corners
of square and pinch to form a "kiss".  Repeat with remaining phyllo.
(You should have 8 filled pastries) Transfer to lightly buttered
baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve
