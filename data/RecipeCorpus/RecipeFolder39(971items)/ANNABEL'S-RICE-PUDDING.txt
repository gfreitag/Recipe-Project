Title: ANNABEL'S RICE PUDDING
Categories: Low fat, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
2 oz Pudding rice
2 oz Sugar
1 pt Skimmed milk - that's an
Imperial pint; 2 1/2 US
Cups
Bring the milk to the boil, then pour over the rice and sugar. Then
EITHER bake in a very low oven for about 2 hours, or, which I prefer,
stir on a low heat on the top of the stove until the rice is cooked.
This will not thicken all that much until it is cold, but when cold
it is deliciously creamy.
