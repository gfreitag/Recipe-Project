Title: APPLE DUFF
Categories: Irish, Classic
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Dessert apples
2 oz Brown sugar
2 oz Raisins
Cinnamon to taste
1    Beaten egg
1/2 pt Cream, whipped
1 pk Puff pastry (12 oz)
(Inspired by James Joyce's "Ulysses")

Preheat the oven to 400'F. Peel and core the apples. Stuff the
centers with a mixture of brown sugar, raisins and cinnamon. Roll out
the pastry and cut out 4 circles approximately 8" in diameter,
depending on the size of the apples. Place an apple in the center of
the pastry circle and brush the edge with beaten egg; draw up the
pastry to enfold the apple, pressing the edges firmly to seal. Brush
the tops of the pastry parcels with the remaining egg to glaze. Bake
in a shallow ovenproof dish for 40 minutes. Serve with whipped cream.
