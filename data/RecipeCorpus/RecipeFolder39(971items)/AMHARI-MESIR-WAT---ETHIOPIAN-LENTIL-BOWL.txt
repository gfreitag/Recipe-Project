Recipe by: Gad S. Sheaffer (gss@iil.intel.com) This recipe is common
to the Ethiopian Jews (Phalashi). My understanding is that these are
NOT unique to them.

Sort the lentils and soak in tap water for 30 minutes. Rinse in
running water and drain. Peel and finely chop the onions. peel and
mash the garlic.Heat the oil in large pan and saute the onion until
golden. Add tomato paste and paprika and mix. Add half the water and
the garlic,ginger pepper and salt. Stir well and then add the rest of
the water, stir again, cover and bring to boil. When the water boil,
add the lentils ,lower the flame and cook 20-30 minutes, until the
lentils soften. Serve hot.
