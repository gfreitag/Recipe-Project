In large bowl, toss apples with 3 tablespoons flour and melted butter;
arrange in pastry shell.  Top with mincemeat. In medium bowl, combine
remaining 1/2 c flour, sugar and cinnamon; cut in cold butter until
crumbly.  Add nuts; sprinkle over mincement.  Bake in lower half of

PAT'S NOTES FROM 1/95:  This pie was excellent.  I used reconstituted
mincemeat (1 box) and as many apples as were needed to fill the pie
plate - lots more than the recipe calls for. I increased the amount
of topping to add sweetness because of the increased number of tart
apples.
