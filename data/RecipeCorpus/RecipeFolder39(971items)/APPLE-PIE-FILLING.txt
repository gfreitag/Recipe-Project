Quality: Use firm, crisp apples. Stayman, Golden Delicious, Rome, and
other varieties of similar quality are suitable. If apples lack
tartness, use an additional 1/4 cup of lemon juice for each 6 quarts
of slices.

Yield: 1 quart or 7 quarts

Procedure: Wash, peel, and core apples. Prepare slices 1/2-inch wide
and place in water containing ascorbic acid to prevent browning. For
more information see "Ensuring High-Quality Canned Foods".

For fresh fruit, place 6 cups at a time in 1 gallon of boiling water.
Boil each batch 1 minute after the water returns to a boil. Drain,
but keep heated fruit in a covered bowl or pot. Combine sugar, Clear
Jel(tm) , and cinnamon in a large kettle with water and apple juice.
If desired, food coloring and nutmeg may be added. Stir and cook on
medium high heat until mixture thickens and begins to bubble. Add
lemon juice and boil 1 minute, stirring constantly. Fold in drained
apple slices immediately and fill jars with mixture without delay,
leaving 1 inch headspace. Adjust lids and process immediately
according to the recommendations in Table 1. See Table 2 for
suggested quantities.
