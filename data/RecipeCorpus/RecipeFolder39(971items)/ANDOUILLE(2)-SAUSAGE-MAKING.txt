Title: ANDOUILLE(2) SAUSAGE MAKING
Categories: Sausages, Meats
Yield: 5 Lbs
4 lb Pork
1 lb Tripe or chitterlings
2    Garlic cloves
3    Bay leaves
2 lg Onions
1 tb Salt (not iodized)
1 tb Pepper
1 ts Cayenne pepper
1 ts Chili pepper
1/2 ts Ground mace
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1/2 ts Ground allspice
1 tb Minced thyme
1 tb Minced marjoram
1 tb Minced parsley
Pork should be approx 2 lbs fat and 2 lbs lean [usually Boston butt]
The tripe is the inner lining of pork stomach and chitterlings
(largest intestine) may be used instead. You can use an extra pound
of pork instead of the tripe/chitterlings.

Chop, do not grind the meat.  Mix with seasonings. Stuff into
casings. Age at least overnight and then smoke several hours using
hickory, hackberry or ash. (Do not use pine.) Throw anything sweet,
such as cane sugar or syrup, raw sugar, molassess, sugar cane or
brown sugar on the wood before lighting. [-=PAM=-]
