Title: AMISH DRESSING
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 20 Servings
2 lb Good quality bread
-cut in 1/2 inch cubes
2 lb Poached chicken thighs
1/2 c  Minced fresh parsley
3/4 c  Chopped onions
1 c  Chopped celery
1 c  Shredded carrot
1 1/4 c  Fine.chopped boiled potatoes
1 tb Rubbed sage
1 tb Celery seed
1 ts Dried thyme
1/2 ts Black pepper
1/2 tb Turmeric
5    Eggs
12 oz Evaporated milk
2 1/2 c  Homemade Chicken Broth
-=OR=- canned broth
Preheat oven to 350 F.  On 2 cookie sheets, toast the bread cubes
for 15 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown. Transfer to a
very large mixer bowl. Bone the chicken and very finely chop the
meat, discarding the skin. (I do this in the food processor while
chicken is still warm.) Add the chopped vegetables and chicken meat
to the bread, along with the seasonings.  Toss. In a medium bowl,
beat the eggs; add the evaporated milk and broth.  Pour over the
bread mixture and blend. The mixture will be quite moist. Allow to
stand 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 F. Transfer the dressing to an
oiled 3 quart glass casserole that is 10 inches in diameter and 3
inches deep (at this point, dressing can be frozen for future use;
thaw before baking.) Bake dressing for 2 hours, or until the center
of the dressing puffs up and is golden brown on top.
