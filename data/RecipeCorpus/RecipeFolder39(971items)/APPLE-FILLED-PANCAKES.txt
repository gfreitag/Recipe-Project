1 TB sugar mixed with
1/2 ts ground cinnamon

You must have a non-stick skillet or this won't work. Whisk sugar,
flour, baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt together. Beat milk with
eggs and vanilla and whisk this into batter; let stand while you cook
the apples.

Melt the butter in a large skillet. When foaming subsides, add the
apples, cover and cook gently for 5 minutes or until soft. Uncover,
raise the heat and evaporate the moisture. When the moisture has
almost completely evaporated, add the sugar and finish boiling the
juices away.

Preheat the broiler with rack set 6 to 7 inches away from heat source.

Oil the bottom and sides of a 10-inch non-stick pan with butter or
non-stick vegetable cooking spray and heat for a minute. Add 1/3 cup
of batter to the pan and tilt so it is well coated. Set skillet on
very low heat and cook for 30 seconds. Gently arrange about 1/4 of
the apple mixture on the first pancake. Pour in 1/3 cup more batter
over the apples to cover them as best as possible. Cook pancake for a
minute over medium heat, lower the heat and cook 2 minutes longer.
Broil for about 3 minutes or until pancake is cooked through and
golden. With a spatula loosen pancake around the edges and transfer
to a platter (cover loosely with foil until all 4

pancakes are done or serve immediately). Repeat procedure with other 3
pancakes; serve dusted with confectioner's sugar.

Yield: 4 servings
