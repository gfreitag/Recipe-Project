Title: ANGLESEY EGGS
Categories: Barry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 pt Milk
1 1/2 lb Leeks
8    Free Range Eggs, Size 2
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Heaped, Cornflour
1 oz Butter
pn Nutmeg
2 oz Grated Caerphilly Cheese
-or cheddar
Trim the leeks and wash them thoroughly. Cut into 1 inch lengths. Put
the milk ( or milk / cream mixture) into a non-stick saucepan with
the leeks and bring to the boil. If you like your leeks soft rather
than slightly crisp, let them boil for a minute or two. Remove the
leeks (leaving the milk in the pan) and put them into a baking dish.
Put the eggs cold into boiling water and cook for exactly five
minutes. Remove, cool and shell. The eggs should be soft in the
middle but the whites will be firm. Lay the shelled eggs on the
leeks. Make a white sauce by whisking in the cornflour, salt and
butter and bring gently to the boil while you whisk. When the sauce
is smooth, thick and glossy, pour it over the eggs and leeks,
sprinkle the top with nutmeg and grated cheese and put it under the
grill until it is hot and bubbling. Don't leave it too long or the
eggs will be over-cooked. Serve at once with lots of crusty bread and
butter
