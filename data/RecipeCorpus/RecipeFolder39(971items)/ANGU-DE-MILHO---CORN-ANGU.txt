Title: ANGU DE MILHO - CORN ANGU
Categories: Misc
Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Cold water
2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Cornmeal

Place half of the water in a medium-size saucepan, add the salt, and
bring it to a boil over medium heat. Slowly mix the cornmeal into the
remaining water. Gradually pour that mixture into the boiling water,
stirring constantly. Add the butter and continue to stir constantly
until the angu turns into a thick porridge which will hold its shape.
