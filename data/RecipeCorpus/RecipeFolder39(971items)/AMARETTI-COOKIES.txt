Title: AMARETTI COOKIES
Categories: New, Text, Import
Yield: 4 Servings    1 1/4 c  blanched and lightly toasted
almonds
:
3/4 c  powdered sugar
2 ts all-purpose flour
2 lg egg whites
1/3 c  granulated sugar
1 ts grated lemon zest
1 ts almond extract

In a food processor, grind the almonds to a powder by pulsing off and
on to keep the powder loose. Mix the almonds with the powdered sugar
and flour. In a separate a bowl, beat the egg whites to soft peaks.
Gradually beat in the granulated sugar until stiff. Fold in the lemon
zest and almond extract. Pipe the mixture with a pastry bag using a
round 1/4-inch tip into 1 1/2-inch rounds onto baking sheets lined
with lightly buttered waxed paper or parchment. Bake in a preheated
275-degree oven for 1 hour, checking to make sure the amaretti don't
brown. Turn off the oven and let the amaretti dry out for an
additional hour--they should be very crisp. Store them in an airtight
container in the refrigerator or freezer.

Yield: Approximately 24 cookies
