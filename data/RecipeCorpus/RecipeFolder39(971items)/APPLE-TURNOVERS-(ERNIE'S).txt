Title: APPLE TURNOVERS (ERNIE'S)
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM-----------------------DOUGH (FOR 12----------------------------
2 c  All purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
3/4 c  Cold butter
2/3 c  Cold water
MMMMM-----------------------FILLING (FOR 4----------------------------
2    Apples
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Sugar
Pastry: Combine flour and salt.  Cut butter into small pieces and
cut into flour.  Add water and mix. Turn onto lightly floured board
and knead about 10 times. Flatten and roll to a long rectangle. Fold
into 1/3 lengthwise and roll out again.  Do this four times, using
sprinkling of flour to cover sticky spots of butter. If it becomes
difficult to roll wrap in plastic and refrigerate until cold.  The
last time you roll it, cut into 3 equal pieces (each piece rolls out
to 10" X 10" and makes 4 turnovers). Freeze 2 of the pieces and use
the apple filling to make 4 turnovers.
Filling: Peel and core apples, slice thinly and mix with sugar and
cinnamon.  Roll dough into 10" X 10" and cut into four 5" X 5"
squares. On a baking sheet, place 1/4 of the mixture on each square
and fold over into triangles. Crimp the edges with a fork so they do
not leak. With a sharp knife cut a couple of slits into each
turnover. Sprinkle sugar over the top. Place in refrigerator while
oven heats to 425 C. Bake 15 minutes until lightly browned.
