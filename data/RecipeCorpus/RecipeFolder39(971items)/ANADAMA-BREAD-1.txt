Note: The original recipe called for 1 1/2 T vegetable oil for the lg
loaf and (1T) for the smaller loaf. I omitted it. Could use
Wonderslim or possibly applesauce instead.

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine
manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the
manufacturer's directions

Let the loaf cool before slicing.
