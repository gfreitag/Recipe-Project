adding more flour if necessary, about 10 minutes.

bowl with plastic.  Let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled,
about 1 1/4 hours.

Grease eight 2 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pans.  Gently knead dough on
lightly floured surface until deflated. Pat out to 3/4 inch-thick
rectangle. Cut into 8 even pieces. Pat each out into 4x7-inch
rectangle. Spread 1 ounce chocolate on short end of each. Roll up
jelly roll fashion. Pinch seam and ends to seal. Arrange seam side
down in prepared pans. Cover with kitchen towel.  Let rise for 15
minutes to lighten.

Preheat oven to 375 F.  Brush loaves with egg glaze and sprinkle with
sugar.  Bake until light brown and loaves sound hollow when tapped on
bottom, about 30 minutes. Immediately remove from pans. Cool on racks
10    minutes.  Serve loaves hot.

Variation:  Spread 1 Tbs raspberry preserves on short end of dough
before adding chopped chocolate.
