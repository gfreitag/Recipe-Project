Title: The Perfect Pancake
Categories: Breakfast, Snacks
Yield: 3 servings
1 1/2 c  Milk
3 tb Melted vegetable shortening
-(margarine can be
-substituted in a pinch)
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Flour
2    Eggs
Sift baking powder, sugar, salt into a bowl. Add eggs, milk and shortening
(shortening can melted in microwave at high for approximately 2.5
minutes). Mix all ingredients and scrape bowl. Heat fry pan or griddle to
medium high. (Lightly grease pan or griddle with Pam or margarine.) Use
1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the
uncooked surface or the edges become dry. Turn pancake until golden brown
on underside and serve. Option: The amount of milk can be varied to change
the thickness of the pancakes. However, please note that the batter will
rise during cooking so experiment by adding more milk as you cook to the
remaining batter on your first batch.
*********** The Pancake: There is rarely anything more satisfying than
good pancakes, possibly because we rely so heavily on egg dishes for
breakfast. Once you have your basic recipe almost anything can be added
for any variation under the sun. Chopped apples, berries, nuts, even
chopped chocolate can grace this simple dish.
*********** The Problem: Most recipes call for a cooling period in the
fridge for a number of hours which forces you to pre)predict what the
family wants for the next day's breakfast or to cut the cooling time and
produce pancakes the size and texture of bar coasters. Many run to
Bisquick or Aunt Jemima for a commercial solution. Here is a batter which
will produce better pancakes in less time, with more fun, to more acclaim,
at a greatly reduced cost.
