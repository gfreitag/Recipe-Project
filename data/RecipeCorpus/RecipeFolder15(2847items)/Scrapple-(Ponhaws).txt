Title: Scrapple (Ponhaws)
Categories: Penndutch, Pork
Yield: 1 servings
1 x  Water
1 ts Sage, powdered
1 ea Hog's head
1 x  Salt & pepper
1 x  Corn meal, yellow
Separate one hog's head into halves. Take out the eyes and brains. Scrape
and thoroughly clean the head. Put into a large kettle and cover with 4 or
5 quarts of cold water. Simmer gently for 2 or 3 hours, or until the meat
falls from the bones. Skim off grease carefully from the surface; remove
meat, chop fine and return to the liquor. Season with salt & pepper to
taste and 1 tsp sage. Sift in granulated yellow corn meal, stirring
constantly, until the mixture is thickened to the consistency of soft mush.
Cook slowly for 1 hour, watching carefully as it scorches easily. When
sufficiently cooked, pour into greased oblong tins and store in a cool
place until ready to use. Cut in thin slices and fry in hot fat until crisp
and brown.
