From Paul Bocuse's French Cooking.  Pastry that crumbles in your mouth.
Method:  Place milk, butter, salt, and sugar in a saucepan.  Bring to a
boil, add the flour, dry the dough on the heat for about 4 minutes, beat in
the eggs, one at a time.  Butter the pastry sheets, put the dough into a
pastry bag, and pipe 60 small puffs onto the sheets.  Bake in a 400 degree
oven for about 20 minutes.
Cream Filling:  Steep a vanilla bean with a pinch of salt in 4 1/2 cups
milk; in a bowl, mix the egg yolks with 1 1/2 cups sugar and then add the
flour; stir into the milk with a whisk and cook over a low flame for a good
5 minutes; use to fill the puffs.
Heat 1 1/2 cups sugar until it melts and turns caramel color.  Oil the
inside of a cone-shaped mold.  Dip the puffs into the caramel.  Starting
from the point, stuff the whole mold with puffs, each one dipped into
caramel.  Let cool.  Unmold.  Decorate with caramelized almonds and
caramelized orange slices.
