Carefully wash and prepare the dandelion as you would lettuce. Roll in
cloth and pat dry. Then put into a salad bowl and place in warm place. Cut
bacon in small pieces, fry quickly and drop over the dandelions. Put the
butter and cream into a skillet and melt over a slow fire. Beat eggs, add
salt, pepper, sugar and vinegar and mix with slightly warm cream mixture.
Pour into skillet and under increased heat, stir until dressing becomes
thick like custard. Take off and pour piping hot over dandelion. Stir
thoroughly. Never use dandelion after it has begun to flower, for then it
is apt to be bitter.
