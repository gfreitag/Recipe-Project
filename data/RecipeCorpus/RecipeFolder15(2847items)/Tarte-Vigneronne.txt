Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
-cut into small pieces
1 ts Vanilla
4    Egg yolks
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 lb Chilled sweet butter
------------------------------FOR THE FILLING------------------------------
1/4 c  Sweet Muscat wine
-(for example:
-Beaumes-de-Venise)
2 lb Seedless grapes
1/2 c  Grape jelly
4    Large eggs
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Cream
1 c  Sugar
3 tb Cornstarch
****Pastry In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade,
combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Pulse 2 or 3 times to blend. Add the
butter and process until the mixture resembles the texture of coarse grain,
about 30 seconds. In a small bowl, beat together the vanilla and egg yolks.
Add to the flour-and-butter mixture with the blade in motion. Process until
dough forms a ball around the blade. Do not overwork or the dough will be
tough. Turn out oil to a floured surface and form in to a smooth ball.
Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour. Butter a 12-inch
tart mold. Roll out dough about 1/8-inch thick and line mold. Refrigerate
for 1 hour before filling. ****filling Preheat oven to 425 degrees. In a
large bowl, whisk the eggs with the milk, cream, sugar, and cornstarch.
Stir in the wine. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve. Spread the grapes in
one flat layer over the bottom of the mold. Ladle in the egg mixture to
fill 3/4 full. Place on a baking sheet in the oven. Cook until filling is
set and pastry is golden, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove to cool on a wire rack.
In a small saucepan, gently melt the jelly over moderately low heat.
Lightly brush filling with jelly while warm to glaze. Let cool completely
before serving. Serves 8. Note: If green grapes are used, substitute
apricot jam. Proceed as above but strain before heating.
