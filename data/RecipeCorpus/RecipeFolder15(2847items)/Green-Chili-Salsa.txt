Title: Green Chili Salsa
Categories: Salsa
Yield: 12 servings
1/2 c  Lime juice
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/8 c  Finely chopped Cilantro or
-to taste
3 1/2 lb Green chilies
3 1/2 lb Tomotillos
3    Or 4 Jalapenos to taste
Or 1 to 3 serannos to taste
2 md Onions
Roast and peel the green chilies. This may be accomplished in the oven with
a broiler, or on the barbecue. Turn the chilies often and roast quickly so
as to loosen the skin in blisters.  When the skin is soft and loose, remove
by grabbing the edges of the skin between a small knife edge and your
thumb.  Chop chilies and all other ingredients (raw) to the consistency you
wish the salsa to be made or perhaps a little coarser. Put all in a kettle
and bring to a boil stirring constantly as the salsa is thick and will burn
easily. Turn down heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
