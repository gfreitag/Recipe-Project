Title: Red Chili Sauce
Categories: Mexican, Sauces
Yield: 12 servings
1 ea Hot Water
1 ea Salt to taste
16 ea Dried red chili pods
2 ea Cloves garlic
Open each dried red chili pod. Wash well inside and out and remove
blemishes. Remove stems, seeds and veins from the pods. For hotter chili
leave some veins. Rinse with cold water and soak in hot water for one hour
or until soft. Place the pods in an electric blender (or food processor)
and add enough water to almost cover them, leaving about two inches
headspace. Blend until smooth and skins disappear, about 2-3 minutes. If
sauce seems to be too thick, add more water and blend for another 1 minute
or until skins disappear. Add 2 cloves garlic and process until well
blended. Salt to taste.
