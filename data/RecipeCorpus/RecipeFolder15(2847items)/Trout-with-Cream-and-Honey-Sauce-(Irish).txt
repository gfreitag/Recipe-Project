Title: Trout with Cream and Honey Sauce (Irish)
Categories: Fish, Irish
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Fresh heavy cream
1 tb Lemon juice
100 g  Flour (seasoned to taste)
300 ml Milk (to soak trout in)
250 g  Trout
1 ts Honey
50 g  Butter
50 g  Whole almonds, skinned
Chop the almonds finely.  Prepare the fish, wash and dry and then soak
in milk for 5-10 minutes.  Toss in seasoned four.  Melt half the butter in
the frying pan, and fry the fish for 5-7 minutes on each side.  Make the
sauce by melting the rest of the butter, adding the chopped almonds.
Saute for a few minutes.  Then add the honey and lemon juice;  bring
carefully to simmering point, and add the cream last, making sure the
temperature is fairly low so it won't curdle.  Pour over the fried fish,
and serve garnished with lemon.
