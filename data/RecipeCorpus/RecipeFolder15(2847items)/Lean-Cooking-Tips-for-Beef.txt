1. Select lean cuts of beef.
2. Choose closely trimmed CHOICE or SELECT grade beef cuts.
3. Trim any visable fat from meat before cooking, and trim inside
separable fat after cooking, but before eating. Research shows that when
beef is cooked with outside fat on, some of the fat liquifies and migrates
to the meat. On the average an additional 9 percent reduction in fat can
be achieved by trimming before cooking.
4. Use cooking methods which do not require additional fat (non-stick
skillets, broiling, roasting on a rack, grilling and ETC.
5. Reduce oil called for in marinades to 1 teaspoon per 1/2 cup marinade
or eliminate completely.
