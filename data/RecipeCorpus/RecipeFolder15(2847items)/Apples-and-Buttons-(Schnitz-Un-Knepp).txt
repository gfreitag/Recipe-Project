Pick over and wash dried apples. Cover with water and let soak over night
or for a number of hours. In the morning, cover ham with cold water and let
boil for 3 hours. Add the apples and water in which they have been soaked

apples. Cover kettle tight and cook dumplings for 15 minutes. Serve piping
hot on large platter.
