You can use any kind of meat (turkey, ham, beef, chicken).  Lay tortillas
flat on cookie sheets.  Layer chosen ingredients on each tortilla,
beginning with meat, if any.  Top with cheese.  Put cookie sheets into
oven and bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees or until cheese is bubbling.
Remove from oven and serve immediately.  This dish is well-suited to
substituting any left over meat and vegetables you may have for those
listed here.  We like to use thin slices of celery and mushrooms in place
of the green pepper and zucchini.  Makes 4.
