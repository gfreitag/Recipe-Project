To use in place of canned creamed soups in casseroles or as a base for
your own soups. Much lower in fat and salt than the canned versions. The
trick is to have it made up ready to use.
Combine all ingredients, mixing well. Store in an airtight container
until ready to use.
To substitute for one can of condensed soup: Combine 1/3 cup of dry mix
with 1 1/4 cups of cold water in a saucepan. Cook and stir until
thickened. Add to casserole as you would the canned product.
Makes equivalent of 9 cans of soup.
