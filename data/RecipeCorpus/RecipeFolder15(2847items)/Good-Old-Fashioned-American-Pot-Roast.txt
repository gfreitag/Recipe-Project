Title: Good Old-Fashioned American Pot Roast
Categories: Beef, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 5 servings
1/2 ts Rosemary
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Marjoram
1/2 ts Crumbled sweet basil
1 c  Beef consomme
3 ea Cloves minced garlic
2 ea Yellow onions, sliced
1/4 ts Fresh-ground black pepper
1 tb Minced parsley
2 1/2 lb Boned bottom round roast
1/4 lb Thinly-sliced mushrooms
1 ts Butter
1 ea Stalk of celery, cut
3 ea Medium carrots, cut in 3s
6 ea New potatoes, with skins
3 tb Tomato paste
1 c  Robust red wine
1/2 ts Parsley
1/2 ts Sage
Heat your broiler and season the roast with the pepper.  Place the
meat  on the broiler pan rack and broil about 4 inches from the heat
until brown on all sides - about 10 minutes or so.  Reduce the oven
temperature to 325 degrees.  Combine the onions, garlic, consomme,  wine,
tomato paste, and spices in a 4-quart Dutch oven.   Add the beef and bring
it to a simmer over moderate heat.   Cover tightly and transfer to the
oven,  and cook for an hour and a half.   Add the potatoes,  carrots and
celery,  and continue baking for another hour, or until the meat is
tender.  Slice the meat into quarter-inch thick slices,  and arrange them,
overlapping slightly, on a heating platter, or a heated serving dish.
Set the potatoes  and carrots around the meat;  keep warm.   Puree the
onions, celery and meat juices in an electric blender or food processor.
Add the butter to a heavy 10-inch skillet and set over moderate heat for
about  30 seconds.  Add the mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes,  until
lightly browned.  Stir in the pureed gravy.  Keep warm over low heat until
ready to serve.  Spoon the sauce over the beef and sprinkle everything
with parsley.
