This is good not only for vegetables, but for seafood and chicken, as well
as for fruit fritters, such as banana, pineapple, and apple. Combine all
ingredients in a blender or food processor and beat until batter is smooth.
Let batter stand, covered, for 4 hours before using. Have vegetables well
drained and patted dry if they have been washed. Dip in batter and fry in
deep fat, 360 degrees, until golden.
