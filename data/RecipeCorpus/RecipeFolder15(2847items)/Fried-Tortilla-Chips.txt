Title: Fried Tortilla Chips
Categories: Appetizers, Mexican, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 x  Salad oil
8 ea Corn tortillas
Arrange 8 corn tortillas in a stack and cut into 6 equal wedges.  Pour
about 1/2 inch salad oil in a deep 2 or 3-quart pan and set on medium-high
to high heat.  When oil is hot enough to make a piece of tortilla sizzle,
add tortilla pieces, a handful at a time, and stir to separate.
Cook until crisp (1 to 1-1/2 minutes); lift from oil with slotted spoon
and drain on paper towels.
