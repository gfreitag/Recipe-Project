1    Or 2 heads of garlic
Fresh rosemary (at least
-one needle per garlic
Break the garlic heads into cloves, but leave the skins on them for
protection. With a small knitting needle or small diameter awl (about the
same diameter as a rosemary needle or a hair smaller) puncture the garlic
cloves the long way through the middle.  Shove a rosemary needle into the
center or each one. Baste the garlic cloves and the inside of a small
baking dish or pan with the olive oil. Bake the rosemary in the oven at
350*F for 15 minutes or until the garlic is soft inside. Cut the garlic
cloves in half lengthwise with a serrated knife and use the contents as you
would butter.
