1/4 ts White Pepper
2 tb Fresh Parsley
1 ea medium egg
3/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ea Chicken Breast

Egg Noodles should be made a day ahead and left to dry.  Beat egg,
mix in flour and salt.  Knead and roll thin.  Cut into rough 1-inch
squares.  In a large kettle or skillet, heat butter and olive oil.
Add onion and chicken cut up into small pieces.  Sautee till chicken
pieces brown.  Add celery and sautee for 5 minutes.  Add flour and
stir into a roux.  Stir for two minutes.  Stir in warm chicken broth
and bring to a boil.  Add potatoes, parsley, pepper, and vinegar.
Simmer 10 minutes.  Stir egg noodles into chicken sauce a few at a time.
Simmer for 15 minutes.  Add water as noodles absorb liquid.  Add enough to
keep a thick sauce.  Serve with hot bacon dressing salad, fruit or
shoo fly pie.   Serves [5] This Pennsylvania German version of Chicken
Pot Pie has no crust, rather the crust or dough is in the pot soaking up
the rich chicken flavors.  I have not seen this pot pie served in
restaurants outside of south-eastern Pennsylvania.  A colonial farmhouse
recipe.
