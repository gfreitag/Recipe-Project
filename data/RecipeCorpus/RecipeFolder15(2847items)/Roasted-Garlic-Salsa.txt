The original version calls for running vegetables through a meat
grinder. However, you can coarsely chop small batches with a food
processor using on-off pulses.
Preliminaries: Build a charcoal fire, then scatter presoaked mesquite
chips over the coals. Using a mesh grilling rack, grill garlic cloves,
turning often until golden brown. Remove from grill; reserve. Grill
tomatoes, onions and chiles over glowing coals, turning frequently,
until skin is charred. Remove from grill and leave skin on vegetables.
Procedure: Core tomatoes; remove stems (not seeds or veins) from
chiles. Cut tomatoes, onions, and chiles into chunks. Place in food
processor or blender, then pulse on-off until mixture forms small,
firm pieces.
Thoroughly combine ground vegetables with remaining
ingredients. Cover; chill at least 24 hours before serving. Yields
about 8-10 cups.
