Title: Steamed Chicken and Beancurd
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts five-spice powder
1 ds sugar
1 ea large carrot
1/2 c  stock
1 ts sesame oil
1 tb cornstarch paste
3 ea lettuce leaves
1 c  chicken meat, minced
2 c  beancurd, mashed
3 ea egg whites
1/2 ts ginger juice
1 tb gin
1 tb peanut oil
1/4 ts salt
Preparation:  All mixing can be done in food processor.  Or, use
cleaver to finely mince chicken and mash beancurd.  In bowl, combine
egg whites, oil, ginger juice, gin, salt, five-spice powder and sugar;
stir to  breakdown egg and blend.  Add chicken and beancurd; mix
thoroughly.  Dip cabbage leaves in boiling water to make limp.  Wash
and peel carrot; slice thinly on bias.  Steaming:  Place limp leaves
in shallow bowl.  Arrange carrots on leaves in decorative pattern.
Pack chicken/beancurd mixture tightly in bowl to fill it.  Steam for
about 40 minutes at medium boil.  Steaming will make mixture very
smooth and firm (avoid over-steaming, which causes beancurd to become
dry and hard).  When ready to serve, turn out on serving platter;
gently remove leaves; cover with glaze.
Glaze:  Heat stock in saucepan; when hot, add cornstarch paste to
thicken.  When ready to use, reheat and add sesame oil; pour over
dish.
