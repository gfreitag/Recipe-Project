Title: Honey Graham Crackers
Categories: Crackers, Breads
Yield: 12 servings
1/2 ea stick butter, cut in 4 pcs
1/3 c  honey
1 ts vanilla extract
5 tb water
2 c  unbleached flour
1/3 c  whole wheat flour
1/2 c  dark brown sugar, packed
3/4 ts baking soda
1/2 ts salt
Use the metal blade of your food processor to combine the
flours, brown sugar, soda, salt and butter, about 10 pulses.  Add the
remaining ingredients, pulse 5 times, then process until the mixture
forms a mass, about 20 seconds. Remove the dough, press it into a ball
and divide it in half. Cover one half with plastic wrap.  Preheat the
oven to 325 degrees.  Roll out the other half on a buttered rimless
14x17 inch baking sheet.  Lightly flour the surface of the dough and
roll until it is very thin and covers the baking sheet. Use the sharp
side of a knife to cut the dough into 3 inch squares, then use the
dull side of the knife to divide the squares in half. Prick evenly
with a fork. Bake until evenly browned and firm to the touch, about
12-15 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough on a second baking
sheet.  Follow the scored lines to cut the crackers apart while warm;
they will crisp as they cool.  Gently lift them from the baking sheet
with a spatula. Separate the crackers and store in airtight
containers.  Makes about 50 crackers.
