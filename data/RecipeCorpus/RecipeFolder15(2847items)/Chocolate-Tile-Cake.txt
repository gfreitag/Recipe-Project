Souffle Cake::  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter jelly roll pan of
approximately 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1 inches; line pan with wax paper; allow
wax paper to extend over each end by about 2 inches.  Set aside.  Melt
chocolate with coffee in 200 degree oven, for about 10 minutes, or until
melted.  Cool.  Beat egg yolks with electric mixer until smooth.
Gradually add sugar and continue beating until mixture is pale yellow,
about 5 minutes.  Stir in the cooled chocolate mixture.  Beat egg whites
with salt until they form stiff peaks.  Stir 1/5 egg whites into chocolate
mixture to lighten and then pour chocolate mixture into egg whites.
Gently fold whites and chocolate together until no white shows.  Pour
batter into prepared jelly roll pan.  Bake for 14 minutes.
Truffle Cream::  Place chocolate in bowl, and place in 200 degree oven for
15 minutes or until melted.  Heat heavy cream in saucepan until hot.
Slowly pour hot cream over melted chocolate, and stir until smooth and
shiny.  Strain mixture into bowl and cool to room temperature.
Tiles::  Place chocolate in bowl and place in 200 degree oven for 15
minutes or until melted.  Place wax paper down the length of a 17 x 14-
inch baking pan.  Secure end with dab of softened butter.  Pour melted
chocolate on wax paper, and with a metal spatula spread it out the length
of the baking pan.  Refrigerate chocolate for 1 hour.  Remove chocolate
and leave it at room temperature for 5 minutes.  Cut chocolate into three
strips, one 3 1/4 inches wide, and two strips 2 1/2 inches wide.  Cut
strips crosswise into 3/4-inch sections to make tiles.  Refrigerate until
needed.  Refrigerate Truffle Cream, mixing bowl and beaters for 1 hour.
Over the top of the Souffle Cake, sift unsweetened cocoa.  Cover the cake
(leave in pan) with a sheet of wax paper and cookie sheet.  Invert cake
onto them.  Remove jelly roll pan and wax paper.  Slip out cookie sheet.
Trim rough edges of cake.  Divide cake lengthwise into 3 equal strips
about 3 1/4 inches each.  Remove the Truffle Cream, mixing bowl and
beaters from refrigerator.  Place 2 1/3 cups cream in mixing bowl.  Return
remainder to refrigerator.  Beat about 1 1/2 minutes.  Place one strip of
cake on cookie sheet.  Spread 1/2 of beaten cream on cake, top cream with
second cake strip.  Place remainder beaten cream over top and cover with
last cake strip.  Trim any rough edges and chill cake for 1/2 hour.  Chill
clean mixing bowl and beaters.  Beat remaining Truffle Cream in chilled
bowl for 1 1/2 minutes.  Remove cake from refrigerator and spread cream
over top and sides.  Remove tiles from refrigerator.  Trim the tiles to
fit height of cake.  Using sharp knife, separate 3 strips of tile.  Place
the 3 1/4-inch tile over top of cake.  Leave wax paper on.  Place the two
remaining strips along sides of cake.  Try to align side and top tiles.
Cover cake tightly with aluminum foil and refrigerate over night.
Remove cake from refrigerator.  Remove foil.  Trim off ends of cake.
Place cake on serving dish.  Peel off strips of wax paper.  Place narrow
strips of foil diagonally on top of cake to form pattern, and sift
confectioners sugar over it.  Lift off foil.  Serve with Creme de Menthe
Custard Sauce.  Serves 12
