Title: Old Fashioned Pound Cake
Categories: Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 18 servings
1 3/4 c  butter
2 1/4 c  granulated sugar
8 ea eggs, separated
3 3/4 c  sifted cake flour
1 1/2 ts baking powder
1 ts grated lemon rind
1 ts nutmeg
Sift together the flour and baking powder three times.  Add the lemon
rind and nutmeg to the butter and work with a spoon until fluffy and
creamy.  Gradually add 1 3/4 cups of the sugar while continuing to
beat with a spoon until light.  Beat egg yolks with hand or electric
mixer until light colored and thick enough to fall from the beater in
a heavy, continuous stream.  Add to butter mixture and beat thoroughly
with a spoon.  Beat egg whites with a hand or electric mixer until
stiff enough to stand up in peaks, but not dry.  Add remaining 1/2 cup
of sugar, 2 Tbs at a time, beating after each addition until sugar is
*just* blended.  Stir 1/3 of the flour mixture into the butter
mixture, then 1/2 of the egg whites, repeating until all is used,
beating very thoroughly with a spoon after each addition.  Turn into
two 10" x 5" x 3" loaf pans which have been greased, paper lined, and
greased again.  Bake in a moderate oven of 325 degrees for 1 hour and
20 minutes, or until done.
