Get plain pig's trotters from your butcher and then brine them for 24
hours. Once they've been brined long enough, bandage them with several
strips of cheesecloth, or tie them several times around the short way with
string, since they will try with all their might to fall apart into many
pieces while cooking. Put into a pot with the vegetables, and cover with
water and the vinegar. Simmer gently for 6 or 7 hours. Allow to cool in
the liquid. -- To serve, split the trotter in two the long way and roll in
melted butter and dried breadcrumbs mixed with a pinch of allspice. Heat
slowly under a broiler, or in the oven at 350 F, until hot and crisp on
the outside. Serve with mustard and horseradish for those who like such
things....and LOTS of wet wipes and paper towels.

Basic brine for trotters:
.
12 1/2 cups water:  3/4 lb sea salt:  3/4 lb brown sugar:  2 oz saltpeter
(optional):  1 t juniper berries:  small piece ungrated nutmeg:  1 bay

ingredients in a pan, bring to boiling point, skim and remove from the

other nonreactive weight, and leave for 24 hours.  (The spices are also
optional if you're in too much of a hurry.)
