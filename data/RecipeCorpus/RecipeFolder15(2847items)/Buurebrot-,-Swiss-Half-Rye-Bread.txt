Title: Buurebrot / Swiss Half-Rye Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 10 servings
1 ts Salt
1 ts Dry yeast
150 g  Rye flour
850 g  Strong white flour
3 c  Water
("Strong white" flour is the UK term for all-purpose flour.) Mix the yeast
in 1/2 C of the water at blood heat, and leave 15 minutes to proof. Sift
the mixed wheat and rye flours into a mixing bowl to warm. When the yeast
has proofed, make a well in the flour, pour the yeast mixture in, and cover
it over with a little flour. Leave for 20 minutes to "set the sponge". When
this time has elapsed, begin mixing (or kneading with the dough hook if
using a mixer). Add 2 cups of the water, check for texture, and add the
rest if necessary. Knead vigorously. If using a dough hook, somewhere about
10 minutes into the process the dough will suddenly change texture and
require more flour. Add it (probably about another 150 g). Turn the dough
into an oiled bowl to rise. The texture will be somewhat sticky. After
allowing to rise for 1-1&1/2 hours, turn out of the bowl, punch down, and
divide into two loaves. Turn into nonstick pans (or greased ones) and allow
to rise for another hour. Bake at 220C for 35 minutes. Turn out of the pans
and allow to sit in the still-hot oven upside down for 5 minutes to harden
the crusts. Let sit overnight before cutting.
