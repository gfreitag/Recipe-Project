Title: Rabbit Cake (Hasen Kucka)
Categories: Penndutch, Meats
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea *potato filling recipe
1 1/2 tb Flour
1 ea Rabbit
1/2 c  Broth **
1 x  Salt & pepper
** "Use broth in which rabbit is cooked". The recipe didn't specify, but I
assume that the rabbit is to be boiled.
Cook the rabbit until tender, separate meat from the bones and cut into
small pieces. Butter a casserole and put a layer of the potato filling in
the bottom, then a layer of meat; add 1 Tbsp of sauce (made by combining
the flour and water), seasoning, and continue until dish is filled. Bake at
350-F until brown (about 25 minutes).
