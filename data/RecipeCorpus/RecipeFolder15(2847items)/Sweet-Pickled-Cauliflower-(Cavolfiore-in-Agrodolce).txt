Title: Sweet-Pickled Cauliflower (Cavolfiore in Agrodolce)
Categories: Relishes, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1 pt Wine vinegar
1 tb Mustard seed
2    Short pieces cinnamon bark
1/2 ts Cloves
1/2 ts Allspice
3    Little dried red peppers
1 lg Cauliflower
- about 2 lbs., trimmed wt.
2 oz Salt
1 pt Water
8 oz Onions
1 lb Sugar
Trim the cauliflower and divide it into florets.  Blanch the florets in
boiling salted water for 5 minutes.  Drain them and run cold water through
them immediately.  Slice the onions and layer them with cauliflower into
sterilized jars.  Heat the vinegar with the sugar and spices, and pour the
boiling mixture into the jars.  The florets should be submerged.  Cover and
seal while hot.  Ready to eat in a week, the pickle will keep in a cool
place all year.  Makes approximately 3 lb. pickle.

Suggestions: Make an oeuf en cocette, very lightly cooked with a teaspoon
of cream and serve it on a plate along with pickled cauliflower, sticks of
cucumber, spring onions, and matchsticks of celery to dip into it.

Toss a few cauliflower florets with a haricot bean salad dressed with olive
oil, some of the pickling liquor, chopped garlic and parsley.

Serve them as part of an antipasto with olives and slices of salad.
