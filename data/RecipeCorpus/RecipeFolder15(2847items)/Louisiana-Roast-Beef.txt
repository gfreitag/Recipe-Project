Title: Louisiana Roast Beef
Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
3/4 ts Black pepper
3/4 ts Minced garlic
1/2 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Ground cayenne
4 lb Boneless sirloin roast
1/4 c  Onions, chopped very fine
1/4 c  Celery, chopped very fine
1/4 c  Bell peppers, chopped fine
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 ts Salt
1 ts White pepper
In a small bowl combine the onions, celery, bell peppers, butter
and seasonings, mix well.
Place roast in a large roasing pan, fat side up.  With a large
knife make 6 to 12 deep slits in the meat (to form pockets) down
to a depth of about 1/2 inch from the bottom; do not cut all the
way through.  Fill the pockets to their depths with the vegetable
mixture, reserving about 1 tablespoon of the vegetables to rub
over the top of the roast. Bake uncovered at 300F until a meat
thermometer reads about 160F for medium doneness, about 3 hours.
For rarer roast, cook until thermometer reads 140F. Serve immediately
topped with some of the pan drippings if you like.
