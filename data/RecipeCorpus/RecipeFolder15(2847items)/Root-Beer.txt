1/4 oz hops
1/2 oz yellow dock root, dried
1/2 oz sassafras root, dried
1 1/2 c  sugar
5 qt water
1/2 oz burdock root, dried
1/2 oz sarsaparilla root, dried
1/2 oz spikenard root, dried
1/8 ts yeast, granulated
Simmer herbs in water for 30 minutes. Add sugar, stir to dissolve, and
strain into a crock. Cool to lukewarm, add yeast, and stir well. Cover
crock and leave to ferment for about an hour. Bottle as described in
Soft Drink Tips and store in a cool place. Makes about one gallon.
*** Notes included with the recipe:  "Root beer extracts, usually in
an amount suitable for five gallons of beverage, are available from
Hires, Schilling, and other herb and spice purveyors. These yield a
drink that's very close in flavor to commercial root beers. Making
your own infusions, however, allows for experimentation and a
distinctive 'house' brew. Ours is less sweet than most."
