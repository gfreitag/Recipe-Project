A dish famous in Berks County is made from the cheese as prepared in Cheese
Custard recipe. Take a cup of the cheese or curd after it has been mashed
through a fine sieve and put it in a bowl. Pour in slowly, sweet milk or
cream- half and half is a good mixture- using the back of a spoon to make
it smooth. Work in sufficient milk and cream to bring it to the consistency
of apple butter. Add salt and pepper and spread on buttered bread. Serve
