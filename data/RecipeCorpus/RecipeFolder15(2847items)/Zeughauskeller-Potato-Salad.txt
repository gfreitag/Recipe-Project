Title: Zeughauskeller Potato Salad
Categories: Salads
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 oz Fresh parsley
1 x  Small onion
1/2 c  Salad dressing
1 c  Beef stock
1 c  Chicken stock
3 3/4 lb Mealy potatoes
(This recipe is an early approximation of the original recipe. All amounts
have been converted from the original metric, and reduced.)

Salad dressing:  About 1/2 C of a good mayonnaise, the fresher the better
~- I think the Zeughauskeller makes their own fresh, every day -- mixed to
taste with German-style mustard (i.e. a sharp yellow mustard rather than a
brown one).

Every utensil must be scrupulously clean, then scalded, including pans. --
Peel and cut up potatoes. Cook until "almost ready", then drain (trying to
retain starch).  Put in pan.  -- Pour BOILING stock over potatoes to bring
out the starch and bind the potatoes together. Let sit 45 minutes to
absorb.  -- Chop parsley and onions (to taste) by hand. Add to potatoes,
toss;  let sit in hot mixture to add flavor.
-- Pour salad dressing over salad:  toss.
