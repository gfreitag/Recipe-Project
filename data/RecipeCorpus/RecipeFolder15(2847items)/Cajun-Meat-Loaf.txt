Categories: Cajun, Beef, Pork
Yield: 10 servings
-------------------------------SEASONING MIX-------------------------------
1/2 ts White pepper
1/2 ts Ground cumin
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
2    Whole bay leaves
1 ts Salt
2 ts Ground cayenne pepper
1 ts Black pepper
------------------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS------------------------------
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/2 c  Evaporated milk
1/2 c  Catsup
1 1/2 lb Ground beef
1/2 lb Ground pork
2    Eggs, lightly beaten
1 c  Very fine bread crumbs
4 tb Unsalted butter
3/4 c  Finely chopped onions
1/2 c  Bell peppers, chopped
1/4 c  Green onions, finely
-chopped
2 ts Minced garlic
1 tb Tabasco sauce
Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.  Melt
the butter in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions, celery,
bell peppers, green onions, garlic, tabasco, Worcestershire and seasoning
mix.  Saute until mixture starts sticking excessively, about 6 minutes,
stirring occasionally and scraping the pan bottom well. Stir in the milk
and catsup. Continue cooking for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool to room temperature. Place the
ground beef and pork in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan. Add the eggs,
the cooked vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs, remove the bay leaves.
Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the center of the pan, shape the
mixture into a loaf that is about 1-1/2 inches high, 6 inches wide and 12
inches long. Bake uncovered at 350F for 25 minutes, then raise heat to 400F
and continue cooking until done, about 35 minutes longer. Serve immediately
as is or with Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef. This is best using both ground
pork and ground beef, as the pork gives more flavor diversity. However, you
can make it with ground beef only.
