Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
2    Carrots (diced)
2    Tomatoes - peeled, seeded,
1/2 ts Dried basil
1/4 ts Dried red pepper flakes
1/2 ts Dried oregano
1 ts Dried parsley flakes
Pepper, black, fresh ground
1/2 lb Dry red kidney beans
1 c  Brown rice

3 tb Olive oil
4    Garlic (minced)
1 md Onion (diced)
2    Stalks celery (diced)
Rinse Beans, add 3-4 cups water & soak overnite (if possible).
Drain Beans, add 3-4 cups cold water, cover and simmer until tender
(30-40 minutes).  Drain beans and reserve 1/2 cup liquid.
Bring 2 1/2 cups salted water to boil, add 1 cup rice, cover and simmer
for 45 minutes (or until all liquid is absorbed).
Put 2 tablespoons olive oil in frying pan and add the minced garlic.
Saute for 3 minutes, stirring so the garlic doesn't burn.  Add onion,
celery, and carrots and saute for an additional 5-7 minutes.
Remove from heat and mix with the rice.  Add the seasonings (all the dried
seasonings, plus salt and pepper) and mix well.  Mix in the beans with
2 tablespoons of the reserved liquid.
Cut the tops off the green peppers and remove the seeds.  Stand peppers
in shallow baking dish that has been brushed with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Fill peppers with bean and rice mixture.   Ladle seasoned diced tomatoes
over top of each pepper and top off each with a tablespoon of reserved
liquid.
Cover dish and roast in 350 degree oven for 35-45 minutes or until
peppers are tender.
