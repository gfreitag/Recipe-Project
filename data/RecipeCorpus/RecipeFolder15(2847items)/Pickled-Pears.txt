Categories: Penndutch, Fruits

1 qt Cider vinegar
1 ts Cloves, whole
14 lb Pear
6 lb Sugar

Any good preserving pear may be used. Slice and remove core or pickle
whole; the latter method is preferred when Sickel pears are used. Peel
pears. Put spices in a small cheese cloth bag and add to the vinegar and
sugar and bring to a boil. Add pears and cook until tender. The pears will
look clear when tender. Remove them with a spoon and place them in
sterilized jars. Boil the syrup until it becomes thick, the pour it over
pears and seal.
