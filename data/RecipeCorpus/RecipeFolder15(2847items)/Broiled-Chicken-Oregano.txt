Title: Broiled Chicken Oregano
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Italian
Yield: 4 servings
1 ea Garlic clove; quartered
4 ea Chicken breast
----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
1/3 c  Olive oil
3 tb Oregano; 1 tbsp dried
1/3 c  Lemon juice
1 x  Salt & pepper to taste
----------------------------BASTING INGREDIENTS----------------------------
1/3 c  Lemon juice
5 tb Butter; melted
3 tb Oregano; fresh or 1 t dried
Several hours before serving-or the day before, if time allows, rub the
chicken pieces pieces with the garlic and place them in a deep china or
earthenware bowl.  Combine marinade ingredients and the garlic clove and
pour over chicken.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate the chicken. Turn
chicken pieces occasionally. When ready to cook, preheat the broiler to its
highest setting. Arrange the chicken pieces on the broiler rack and baste
with a little of the melted butter mixture. (Reserve part of the basting
mixture to serve over the chicken when served.) Broil the chicken 3-4
inches from the heat for 5-8 minutes per side, basting often. Chicken is
done when juices run clear when pierced with a sharp knife. Remove to
serving platter, pour reserved basting mixture over the chicken breasts and
serve immediately. This is also good done on a BBQ.
