1/3 c  sugar
1 tb cinnamon
1/3 c  raisins

Sprinkle yeast over warm water; stir to dissolve.  Add molasses, then

beaten egg white.  Allow to rise 30-40 minutes.
Stir in first of the unbleached flour (A) until blended; beat 10
minutes.  Cover bowl, set in warm place and let rise about 1 hour 20
minutes.
Fold in melted butter and salt.  Add pastry flour and additional
unbleached flour (B), 1 cup at a time, folding in (do not stir).  When
dough holds together in one piece, turn out onto floured surface.
With floured hands, knead dough, adding flour and reflouring board as
needed.  Knead until smooth and somewhat shiny.  Place dough in oiled
bowl, roll dough to oil top, and cover with towel. Let rise until
doubled in size.
After dough has risen, roll out to 12" x 14" (if making 16 rolls;
figure 3/4" x 14" for each roll when scaling).  Spread with soft
butter.  Sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon and raisins.  Roll up (crimp
edges to roll).  Cut into 3/4" sections.  Lay rolls flat on oiled
cookie sheets and let rise 30 minutes.
Mix egg with water and brush over rolls.  Bake at 375 degrees for 20
minutes.  Makes 16 rolls
