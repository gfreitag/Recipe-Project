Title: Brandied Peaches
Categories: Penndutch
Yield: 1 servings
1 qt Brandy
1 ea Peach
1 x  Sugar
Skin peaches by pouring boiling water over a few at a time and allowing to
stand a few minutes. Then dip in cold water and skins will rub off. After
peaches have been skinned, measure them and use one half of their weight in
sugar. Have a large, clean, covered stone crock and put in a layer of
peaches and a layer of sugar until all ingredients are used. Pour the
brandy over the layers. Cover the crock with a heavy piece of white muslin
before placing on the top of the crock. Set aside in a cool place and allow
peaches to stand 2 to 3 months before using.
