One of the few low-fat coffee cakes we've found. The texture seems to be
best when baked in a tube pan.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cream margarine, egg whites, lemon rind,
juice and brown sugar until smooth. Sift together dry ingredients and add
alternatly with yogurt to egg white mixture. Fold in fruit, and spread
into a tube pan which has been sprayed with nonstick spray. Combine all
topping ingredients(it works well to use the same bowl and incorporate the
scrapings from the batter)and sprinkle over coffee cake. Bake for about 35
minutes until wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Serve
topped with yogurt, if desired. Makes 16 servings.
