Title: Cracked Wheat Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 30 servings
1 c  milk or buttermilk
3 tb butter
4 c  whole wheat flour
1 ts salt
1 c  cracked wheat
1/2 c  warm water
3 tb molasses
1/2 c  yeast (really!)
1 c  water
1/2 c  honey
Combine warm water and molasses.  Add yeast.  Stir 100 times to start
yeast action.  Mix remaining water, honey, milk and butter; heat to body
temperature.  Add to yeast mix and let stand 10 minutes.  Stir together
flour, salt and cracked wheat and add to yeast mixture.
Turn onto floured work surface and knead until hands are clean, or until
you're perspiring, at least 20 minutes.  (We get the whole family to
help.) Place dough in lightly oiled bowl.  Cover with a towel and let rise
in warm place for about one hour, until double in size.  Punch down and
knead again for 5 minutes.  Divide dough and place in oiled loaf pans.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30-45 minutes or until bread makes a thud sound
when thumped with finger.  Let cool before slicing.  After you make this
you've earned a rest.  Serve it with a simple green salad and cheese.
Makes 3 loaves.
