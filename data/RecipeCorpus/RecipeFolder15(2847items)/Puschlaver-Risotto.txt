Title: Puschlaver Risotto
Categories: Vegetables, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
8 dl Bouillon
100 g  Grated cheese
250 g  Veal, cut into thin strips
1 dl Heavy cream
2 x  Tomatoes, skinned and cubed
1 x  Bunch parsley, chopped fine
30 g  Dried ceps or other mushroom
100 g  Butter
1 x  Onion, chopped fine
1/8 ts Saffron, broken up small
1 dl Red wine
350 g  Risotto rice (Arborio)
Soak the mushrooms, then drain and dry well.  Reserve 2 dl of the soaking
liquid.  Melt 40 g of the butter in a pan: add the onion, mushrooms, garlic
and saute quickly; then add the red wine and lower the heat so that it's
partly absorbed.  Then add the rice and saffron and stir well. Add the
bouillon and the mushroom-water, stir, and reduce heat to a simmer.
Cook slowly until the liquid is absorbed.  The rice should be al dente. --
The butter and grated cheese are tossed in with the risotto when it's
complete.  -- Flour the veal lightly and saute it in more butter;
when done, lower the heat and add the cream, stirring carefully. Make a
"dent" in the middle of the risotto and ladle the veal-and-cream mixture
into this.  As a garnish, saute the tomatoes and parsley in the rest of the
butter, and scatter over the top of the risotto.
Serve.
