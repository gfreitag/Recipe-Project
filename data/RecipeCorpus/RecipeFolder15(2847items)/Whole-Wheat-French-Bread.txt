Title: Whole Wheat French Bread
Categories: Breads, French
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  White flour
2 c  Whole wheat flour(or 3)
1 ea Egg white+1 T cold water
1 tb Active dry yeast
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Lite salt
2 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
Combine yeast, sugar,lite salt and water in a large bowl. Gradually add
the flours and mix well(hands work best). At first the dough will be very
sticky; add enough flour to transfer it to a lightly floured board. Knead
until the dough is no longer sticky(about 10 minutes), adding more flour
as necessary. Place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and
let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume(1 1/2-2 hours). Punch
dough down. Transfer to a floured board and cut into four equal parts.
Roll and shape each part into a long loaf. Place loaves into a lightly
oiled, special long-loaf pans(baguette pans). Slash the top of each loaf
diagonally in three or four places and brush with egg white and water
mixture. Let dough rise another hour or until doubled in volume. Preheat
oven to 350 degrees. Bake the loaves until browned and hollow-sounding
when thumped, about 25 minutes.*  Halfway through baking, it may be
necessary to cover the loaves with foil to prevent scorching the tops. Let
cool on rack. Makes 4 loaves, about 18 inches long.
* If planning to freeze bread, underbake,i.e., bake in oven only 15
minutes. Wrap in foil when cool.Freeze. When ready to serve remove from
freezer. Leave wrapped in foil. Place in 350 degree oven for 10 minutes.
Remove foil and continue to bake for 5  minutes, until crisp.
