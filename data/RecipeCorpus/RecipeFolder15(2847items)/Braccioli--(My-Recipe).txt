A GOOD MEAT RECIPE TO SERVE WITH LASAGNE OR PASTA MEALS Place parsley,
garlic, bread crumbs, cheese, onion, hard-cooked eggs, diced bacon, pepper,
and a pinch of oregano in a bowl and mix well.  Pound the steak on both of
its sides and lay it flat on a table. Spread mixed ingredients on top of
steak.
Fold edges in and roll.  Tie securely with string.
Dip rolled and tied steak in beaten egg, then in flour. Heat oil in a
skillet, saute steak on all sides until golden brown. Place in a roasting
pan.
Add water and roast in a 350F. oven for 45 minutes.
Cut into 1-1/2 inch slices and serve as is, or pour spaghetti sauce over
the steak, if desired. Source: Mama D's, revised over the years.
