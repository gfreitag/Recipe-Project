Title: Sorrel Soup (Irish)
Categories: Soups, Vegetables, Irish
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Breadcrumbs
1 x  Salt and pepper
2 ea Egg yolks
150 ml Cream
1 lb Sorrel
3 oz Butter
1 x  Large onion, chopped
2 tb Flour (heaped)
2 1/2 l  Stock
Wash the sorrel well and chop it up.  Heat the butter in a saucepan and
just soften the sorrel and onion in it.  Shake the flour over the
vegetables and mix well.  Let it cook for about 1 minute.  Meanwhile bring
the stock to the boil, then add to the pan.  Add the breadcrumbs, season
to taste, and bring to the boil, then simmer for about 1 hour covered.
(It can be liquidized at this point, but needn't be.)  Beat the egg yolks
with the cream and add a little of the hot soup to the mixture, stirring
well;  then add gradually to the soup pot, stirring well, over the heat,
but being careful not to let it boil.
