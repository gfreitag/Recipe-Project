wings in batter and deep fry in oil.  Let sit while making the sauce.
Sweet and Sour Sauce:  select a pan in which all wings can be coated
evenly, such as a large electric fry pan.  Combine sugar, vinegar, water,
soy sauce, catsup and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.  As sauce
begins to thicken, add wings and cook on medium heat.  Turn wings
carefully to coat thoroughly with sauce.
Garnish with nuts if desired.  Grated sesame adds a good flavor.
