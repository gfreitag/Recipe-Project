Categories: Sauces, Pasta
Yield: 12 servings
2 ts Dried oregano
2 ts Dried basil
1    Bay leaf
1 ts Salt
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
2 lb Lean ground beef
3 tb Olive oil
1 c  Onions chopped
2    Cloves garlic minced
2 cn Tomato paste plus

Brown the ground beef and drain.   Saut  the onions in olive oil and add
minced garlic shortly before the onions are tender. Add the onions and beef
to a large pot and add remaining ingredients.  Cook on very low heat for 4
hours skimming off any extra grease from the beef and adjusting seasoning.
Note:  My father would often freeze this basic sauce and add fresh
mushrooms when he planned to serve it.
