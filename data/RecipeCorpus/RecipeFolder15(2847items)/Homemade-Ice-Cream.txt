Categories: Desserts
Yield: 20 servings
13 oz evaporated milk
1 ea gal. lo-fat milk
1 ea ice, crushed
6 ea eggs
2 c  sugar
1/4 ts salt

Use enough lo-fat milk to fill ice cream freezer. You also need 10 to 15
lbs.  crushed ice and rock salt to freeze ice cream.  In large mixing
bowl, beat eggs.  Add sugar gradually, stirring constantly (using an
electric mixer is okay).  Add salt, vanilla and canned milk.  Add about a
pint of the fresh milk and mix.  Pour mixture into ice cream freezer can.
Add rest of milk to fill can to the middle of the top paddle board.
Assemble ice cream freezer.  Add chipped ice and rock salt to barrel
around freezer can.  Crank freezer until ice cream is stiff; cranking will
become harder as ice cream hardens.  Add additional ice and salt to barrel
as needed.  Makes 5 quarts. Stores well .
