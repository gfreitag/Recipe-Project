Title: Fortune Cookies
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 12 servings
1/2 ts VANILLA
1/2 ts CINNAMON
1/8 c  BUTTER
EGG, UNBEATEN
WHITE
1/4 c  SUGAR
1/4 c  FLOUR
Combine unbeaten egg white and sugar in a small 1-quart bowl and mix well
until all sugar is dissolved.  Stir in, one at a time, the other dry
ingredients.  Then beat until well blended.
Melt butter in a small 1-quart bowl in microwave oven, 15 seconds.
Remove from oven and beat batter into the butter.
Drop by teaspoonfuls, well apart onto a lightly greased baking dish.
Microwave at FULL POWER 3 minutes. (9-12 cookies can bake at once.)
Let stand only one minute because it is necessary to curl cookie while
warm.  The top of the cookie will be the outside and the underneath part
will be folded inward with the message.
Repeat for the next batch.
Makes 1 to 1 1/2 dozen.
