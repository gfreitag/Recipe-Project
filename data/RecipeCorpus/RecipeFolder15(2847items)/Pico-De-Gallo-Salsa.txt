Title: Pico De Gallo Salsa
Categories: Salsa
Yield: 8 servings
2 ts sugar
1/4 c  mexican beer
2 ts salt
1 ea juice of 1 lime
2 tb diced onion
2 c  tomatoes
2 ea serrano chiles
2 tb finely chopped cilantro
Tomatoes cut in 1/4 inch cubes - serrano chiles, finely chopped.
Put onions in a strainer, rinse with hot water, drain. Combine all
ingredients and mix well. Let sit in the refrigerator for at least 30
minutes before serving. Feel free to comsume the rest of the beer while
waiting.  More sugar may be used if the tomatoes are acidic, but make sure
the salsa does not taste of sugar.  I find 2 tsp. of salt too much for my
tastes, I use 1 tsp. The salsa also works well without the beer.
