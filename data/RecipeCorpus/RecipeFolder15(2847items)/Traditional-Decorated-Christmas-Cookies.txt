-----------------------------------COOKIE-----------------------------------
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Salt
2 1/4 c  Flour, all purpose; unsifted
1 tb Water; (use 2 if req'd)
3/4 c  Butter, unsalted; softened
1/2 c  Sugar
1    Egg
1 tb Lemon peel; finely grated
-----------------------------------ICING-----------------------------------
2 ts Water; (use 3 if req'd)
Food colors, sprinkles, etc
3    Egg whites
1 lb Sugar, powdered
Beat together butter and sugar in small bowl with electric mixer until
light and fluffy. Beat in egg, lemon peel, vanilla and salt. Gradually beat
in flour until thoroughly incorporated. Add water, a few drops at a time,
only until dough starts to come away from side of bowl. Wrap dough in
plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 350Ã¸F. Lightly grease 4 cookie sheets. On lightly floured
surface, roll out dough to 1/8" thickness. Cut out various shapes using
cookie cutters or homemade cardboard patterns, or freehand. Reroll scraps
and cut out. Make small holes with wooden pick if planning to hang cookies.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until beginning to brown around edges. Remove
cookies to wire rack to cool before decorating.

Prepare icing: Beat egg whites in small bowl with electric mixer until
foamy. Slowly beat in the powdered sugar. Continue to beat until thick and
creamy. Add just enough water to get a good spreading consistency. Tint
with food coloring, if you wish. Spread evenly over cookies. Decorate with
glitter, sprinkles, dragees and cinnamon red hots, if desired.
