Title: Pumpernickle Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 30 servings
2 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Very warm water (105F)
2 c  Mashed potatoes
4 c  Rye flour (dark rye for
-darker bread)
4 c  Whole-wheat flour
1 1/2 c  Cold water
3/4 c  Yellow cornmeal
1 1/2 c  Boiling water
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Shortening
1 tb Caraway seeds
Stir cold water into the cornmeal in a saucepan. Add the boiling water and
cook, stirring constantly, until thick. Add salt, sugar, shortening, and
caraway seeds and let stand until lukewarm.  Sprinkle the dry yeast into
the warm water. Let stand a few minutes and then stir until dissolved. Add
the yeast and mashed potatoes to the cornmeal mixture; mix well. Stir in
the flours. Turn out on a floured pastry cloth or board and knead until
smooth and satiny. Put in a greased bowl; turn once, cover and let rise
until doubled in bulk. Divide dough into 3 portions, form into balls and
let rest for a few minutes. Roll each ball twice as long and twice as wide
as the pan in which it is to be baked. Fold ends into the center and
overlap slightly. Press sides to seal and fold over in a similar fashion to
fit the pan. Put each one in a greased pan, seam side down. Let rise until
doubled and then bake in a preheated 375F oven for about an hour.
