Title: Mary Rogers's Sourdough Biscuits
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 ts Salt
2 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Baking Soda
1/4 ts Cream Of Tartar
1/2 c  Active Starter
1 c  Milk
2 1/2 c  Flour
1/3 c  Lard or Shortening
1 tb Sugar
At bedtime make a batter of the half cup of starter, cup of milk, and 1 cup
of the flour.  Let set overnight if the biscuits are wanted for breakfast.
If wanted for noon, the batter maybe mixed in the morning and set in a warm
place to rise.  However, unless the weather is real warm, it is always all
right to let it ferment overnight. It will get very light and bubbly.
When ready to mix the biscuits, sift together the remaining cup and a half
of flour and all other dry ingredients except the baking soda.  Work in the
lard or shortening with your fingers or a fork.  Add baking soda dissolved
in a little warm water to the sponge and then add the flour mixture.
Mix into a soft dough.  Knead lightly a few times to get in shape.  Roll
out to about 1/2 inch thickness or a little thicker,and cut with a biscuit
cutter.  Place close together in a 9 x 13-inch pan, turning to grease tops.
Cover and set in a warm place to rise for about 45 minutes.  Bake in a 375
degree oven for about 30 to 35 minutes.  Leftovers are good split and
toasted in a sandwich toaster.
