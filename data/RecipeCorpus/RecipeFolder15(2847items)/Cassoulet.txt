Title: Cassoulet
Categories: Casseroles, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 qt Chicken stock or water
-(enough to cover beans)
4    Thighs confit de canard
-(see note)
1 lb Sweet sausages
1/2 lb Lamb cut into 1-inch cubes
(from the leg, neck,
-shoulder, or breast)
1 c  Dry bread crumbs
1/4 c  Finely chopped fresh parsley
2 tb Melted sweet butter
1 lb White beans (great northern
-or navy)
2 oz Slab bacon, cut into
-small pieces
4 oz Piece of smoked ham
1 lg Onion, coarsely chopped
2    Cloves garlic, chopped
Bouquet garni (see note)
3 tb Peeled, seeded, and chopped
-tomatoes (2 medium fresh
-or use canned)
****Soak the beans overnight in cold water. Change water and rinse often.
In a large, heavy saucepan or kettle, combine the beans, bacon, ham, onion,
garlic, bouquet garni, tomatoes, and enough chicken stock or water to just
cover the beans. Bring to a boil over moderately high heat. Reduce heat and
simmer until beans are soft but not mushy, 45 to 60 minutes. (Cooking time
varies according to variety and age of beans.) ****Brown confit as directed
on package or until crisp and golden. Cook and brown sausages. Saute lamb
in a small amount of cooking oil or butter until brown. Drain all meats on
paper towels. ****In a large, oven-proof casserole, arrange the pieces of
confit to fit the bottom snugly. Spoon over a layer of beans. Cover with
lamb and add another layer of beans. Add the sausages and top with the
remaining beans. ****Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Combine the bread crumbs
and parsley. Sprinkle over the top. Dribble with melted butter and set in
the middle of the preheated oven. Cook until top is browned and golden,
about 30 minutes. Add a cup of water or two around the edges during cooking
to moisten, if desired. Serve right from the pot while hot. Serves 4 to 6.
****Note: Make the bouquet garni of sprigs of fresh thyme and parsley
tucked inside a thick piece of leek and secured with kitchen string. This
makes it easy to remove at the end of cooking when all of the flavor has
been released. An alternative is to tie herbs in a small piece of
cheesecloth, which can be lifted out. ****Note: Confit de canard is duck
preserved in its own fat.  While once impossible to find outside France,
this delicacy is now available in some fancy food stores or by mail order.
Ambitious cooks might want to try their hand at making their own. The
somewhat laborious procedure is described in many classic French cookbooks.
