Title: Hot Chicken Wings
Categories: Cajun, Appetizers, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
6 oz Hot sauce or Tabasco
1/2 c  Melted butter
2 1/2 lb Chicken wings
1 x  Oil for frying (optional)
Cut the chicken wings in two at the joints.  In a large frying
pan or skillet; heat to 360F enough oil (or shortening) to
cover the chicken wings.  Add the wings and fry until crisp,
about 12-15 minutes.
To bake, preheat the oven to 450F.  Spread the chicken wings
out on a baking sheet in one layer and bake 45 minutes.
To make the sauce, combine the Hot Sauce or Tabasco and melted
butter and blend thoroughly.  As soon as the chicken wings are
cooked, douse with the sauce, and serve immediately.
Serves 2-6
Nathalie Dupree's "New Southern Cooking"
Nathalie says, "These little wings make a good meal for two or are
a great appetizer.  Up North, they are called Buffalo wings and are
served with celery and blue-cheese dressing.  The little wing tips
should be trimmed off to make neater pieces.  But I cook them along
with the wings and save them for myself.  I call them the "cook's
treat."  You may fry or bake the wings, depending on dietary
considerations.
