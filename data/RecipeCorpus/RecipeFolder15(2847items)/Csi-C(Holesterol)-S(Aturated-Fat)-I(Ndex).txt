The Cholesterol-Saturated Fat Index:
"In order to make it easier for people to select foods that are low in
BOTH cholesterol and saturated fats, we have devised a
Cholesterol-Saturated FAt Index(CSI). The CSI enables you to grasp the
contribution of both saturated fat AND cholesterol in one food compared to
another. The CSI reflects our findings that the amount of saturated fat in
the diet is just as important as the amount of cholesterol in terms of
dietary control of the cholesterol and LDL in the blood.
The lower the CSI number, the better the food choice for the
prevention of heart disease(and the other disorders.....).
The New American Diet bySonja L. Connor,M.S.,R.D and William E.
Connor,M.D.
I recomend very highly that you purchase and read the Connor's book.
Besides the recipes which are included in this DB the book is filled with
the latest research on degenerative diseases and diet.
