Yield: 1 servings

In a saucepan, melt butter and stir in brown sugar.  Bring to a boil
and cook for 2 minutes over low heat, stirring constantly.  Slowly
stir in milk and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and let cool
somewhat.  Add powdered sugar a little at a time, beating until smooth
and thick enough to spread.  Add more sugar if necessary to obtain
