Title: Irish Stew (2) [Biddy Whyte Lennon]
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Irish, Stew
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Chopped fresh thyme
1 x  Water
1 x  Salt and fresh black pepper
1 1/2 lb Stewing lamb or mutton
2 x  Large onions
3 lb Potatoes
1 x  Large bunch fresh parsley
Peel the onions and slice them into rounds.  Peel the potatoes as thinly
as possible.  Leave them whole unless they are very large.  Cut the meat
into good-sized pieces.  Small chops can be left whole, larger ones
divided in two.  Place a layer of onions on the bottom of a heavy
casserole, and the meat on top of them.  Sprinkle chopped thyme and
parsley generously, and season well.  Layer the rest of the onions with
the potatoes.  Sprinkle thyme and parsley again at the last.  The amount
of water you need to add depends on how good the seal is between your pot
and its lid, and whether you like a "wet" or "dry" stew.  You will
certainly not need more than two cups, and I use barely one.  Bring the
water to a boil, cover as tightly as possible, and place in a preheated
oven at 300F for 2 1/2 - 3 hours.  Keep an eye on it towards the end, and
adjust the gravy by adding a little water if you think it too dry.  A good
stew should have some gravy, but should not be flooded by it.  "Floury"
potatoes will dissolve into the gravy, "waxy" ones will not.  I tend to
use a mixture.  Serve very hot with more fresh chopped parsley sprinkled
on top.  White soda bread to mop up the gravy.
