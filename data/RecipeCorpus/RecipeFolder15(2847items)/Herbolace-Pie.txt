Title: Herbolace Pie
Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
4    Eggs
2 tb Milk (or more)
Fresh mint, parsley & chives
Beaten egg to glaze
1    Shortcrust pastry
-- (see note)
6 oz Curd cheese
4 oz Cottage cheese
2 oz (generous) mature cheddar
*Note: Shortcrust pastry should be made with 8 oz flour, preferably whole
wheat.

Sieve both the soft cheeses to make a smooth mixture.  Beat in about 2
tablespoons each coarsley chopped parsley, mint and chives to make a
prettily green-flecked mixture.  Add salt, pepper and the milk.

Use half the pastry to line a pie plate measuring about 8 1/2 inches
across the top.  Put the cheese mixture into it, make four hollows with the
back of a spoon and break an egg into each.  Season the eggs with a pinch
of salt, a good grinding of pepper and scatter more herbs over the top--at
least 3 tablespoons of mint and perhaps 1 of chives.

Cover with remaining pastry.  Seal, flute, glaze and make a few steam
slits in the usual way.  Bake on a preheated baking sheet at 425 F (220 C)
gas mark 7 for 25 minutes, then at 375 F (190 C) gas mark 6 for 15 minutes.
Cool for 5-10 minutes before serving with a tomato salad or a green salad.
