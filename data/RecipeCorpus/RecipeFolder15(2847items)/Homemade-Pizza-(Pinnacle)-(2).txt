FLOUR THE SURFACE YOU WILL USE TO ROLL OUT THE DOUGH. YOU CAN NOT USE TOO
MUCH FLOUR. USING A ROLLING PIN, ROLL DOUGH TO ABOUT 13 - 14" CIRCLE. IT
MIGHT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE BUT CAN BE DONE. PLACE THE ROLLED OUT CRUST ON A
GREASED PAN. USE YOUR FINGER TIPS TO PRESS THE DOUGH TO THE PAN. TRIM OFF
EXCESS DOUGH FROM AROUND THE EDGES AND PUT IT WITH THE REMAINING DOUGH.
THICK CRUST:
START WITH A BALL OF DOUGH SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN A BASEBALL. PLACE THE
DOUGH IN THE CENTER OF THE GREASED PIZZA PAN AND WITH YOUR HANDS, PUSH AND
SPREAD THE DOUGH UNTIL IT COVERS THE ENTIRE PAN.
DO NOT PUT THE TOPPINGS ON TO HEAVILY UNTIL YOU GET THE FEEL FOR FLAVOR.
COOKING THE PIZZA:
THE BEST TEMPERATURE TO COOK THE PIZZA AT IS AROUND 475 F. IT ONLY TAKES
ABOUT 12 -14 MINUTES TO COOK A PIZZA SO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON YOUR
MASTERPIECE.
AFTER THE PIZZA HAS COOKED FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES YOU ARE READY TO TEST THE
CRUST FOR DONENESS. DO THIS BY LIFTING THE EDGE WITH A SPATULA. IF THE
PIZZA SLIDES IN THE PAN WHEN YOU SHAKE IT, YOU ARE READY FOR THE LAST
STEP.
REMOVE THE PIZZA FROM THE OVEN AND PLACE THINLY SLICED MOZZARELLA CHEESE
ON TOP. SLIDE THE PIZZA OFF THE PAN ONTO THE OVEN RACK. COOK FOR ABOUT 5
MINUTES. YOU NOW HAVE A PIZZA WITH A GOLDEN BROWN CRUST AND CRISP.
****************   TIPS FOR PIZZA MAKERS  *******************
FOR THE DOUGH:
1. USE A HEAVY GLASS BOWL RINSED WITH WARM WATER TO LET THE DOUGH RISE.
2. YOU CAN USE THE DOUGH WITHOUT RISING IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY.
3. TRY PUTTING SMALL AMOUNTS OF SPICE IN THE DOUGH WHILE MIXING IT UP.
4. YOU CAN USE WHOLE WHEAT OR RYE FLOUR IN PLACE OF ALL PURPOSE FOR A
DIFFERENT TASTE.
5. YOU CAN ADD CHEESE TO THE FLOUR TO MAKE A TASTEY DOUGH.
6. DON'T THROW OUT LEFT OVER DOUGH, IT WILL KEEP IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR
MORE TWO WEEKS. MAKE SURE YOU STORE IT IN A LARGE BAG AS IT WILL RISE
SOME. WHEN YOU ARE READY TO USE THE DOUGH LET IT WARM SOME FIRST.
THE SAUCE:
1. IF THE OIL RISES TO THE TOP WHILE COOKING, SIMPLY STIR IT BACK IN WHEN
COOKING IS FINISHED.
2. YOU CAN USE THE SAUCE WHILE IT IS STILL HOT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET IT
COOL FIRST.
3. THE SAUCE CAN BE KEPT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR UP TO ONE WEEK. TO KEEP
IT LONGER, FREEZE IT!
4. A MIXTURE OF 1 TABLESPOON FLOUR AND 14/ CUP WATER WILL SPEED UP
THICKENING PROCESS.
5. TO INCREASE THE YIELD OR CHANGE THE FLAVOR OF THE SAUCE, YOU CAN ADD
ANY CANNED PIZZA SAUCE TO THE RECIPES ABOVE.
6. USE CRUSHED SPICES IN ALL THE RECIPES RATHER THAN POWDERED.
7. YOU GROUND, DRY ONION OR GARLIC INSTEAD OF FRESH. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS
ON THE PACKAGE FOR AMOUNTS TO USE.
THE FINAL:
1. IF YOU USE SLICED MOZZARELLA CHEESE YOU WILL FIND THE SLICE THICKNESS
VARIES GREATLY. YOU MAY NEED TO PLACE THE CHEESE ON BEFORE YOU SLIDE
THE PIZZA OFF THE PAN, TO KEEP THE CRUST FROM BEING DONE BEFORE THE
CHEESE MELTS.
2. IF THE CRUST IS DONE AND THE CHEESE IS NOT MELTED, SLIDE THE PIZZA BACK
ONTO THE PAN.
3. IF THE PIZZA IS TO SOFT WHEN YOU SLIDE IT OFF THE PAN, YOU DID NOT USE
ENOUGH FLOUR. USE MORE NEXT TIME.
4. IF YOU HAVE ANY CHOPPED CHEESE LEFT OVER, FREEZE IT AS IT MOLDS FASTER
AFTER BEING GRATED.
5. USE LEFT OVER SAUCE IN ANY ITALIAN DISH CALLING FOR TOMATO TYPE SAUCE.
OR YOU MAY SAVE IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR A GOOD MIDNIGHT PIZZA SNACK.
*********************  FOR A FAST PIZZA  *****************************
YOU CAN MAKE A FAST PIZZA BY USING TORTILLAS, EITHER CORN OR FLOUR.
EVERYTHING ELSE REMAINS THE SAME. ALL INGREDIENTS GO ON TOGETHER ON A
TORTILLA CRUST PIZZA AS THEY COOK VERY FAST. BE SURE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE
ON THEM WHILE COOKING. YOU STILL WANT TO SLIDE THE PIZZA'S OFF THE PAN
BEFORE THEY ARE DONE TO CRISP UP THE CRUST.
IT IS CERTAINLY HOPED THAT YOU WILL ENJOY THE RECIPES ABOVE AND HAVE FUN
MAKING HOMEMADE PIZZA'S FOR YOUR FAMILY.
