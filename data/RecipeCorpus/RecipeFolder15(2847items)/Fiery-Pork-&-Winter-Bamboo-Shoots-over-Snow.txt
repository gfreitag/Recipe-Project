matchsticks.  Slice pork like bamboo & marinate in thin soy sauce &
cornstarch for 10 minutes.  Peel & slice garlic in thin rounds. Combine
stock, chili paste & sugar. Deep-frying Rice Stick: Break up rice stick
before measuring.  Heat vegetable oil in hot wok. When oil is medium hot,
test a few pieces of rice stick: it should fry quickly to a puffy white. If
it browns, turn down the heat. Fry rice sticks in very small batches.
Spread out fried snow on serving platter, reserve in warm place.

until it just begins to smoke; add drained pork & stir-fry briskly for
about 2 minutes.  Add bamboo, garlic & ginger.  Toss with pork for 1
minute.  Re-stir liquids and add to wok.  Cover wok, & simmer for 3
minutes.  Remove cover; turn up heat again; boil briefly to reduce sauce;
sprinkle on vinegar.  Ladle over rice stick & serve. Serves 4
