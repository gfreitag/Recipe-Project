Title: Stir-Fried Scallops in a Basket
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1 ea clove garlic, crushed
2 tb peanut oil
1 ds salt
2/3 c  chicken stock
2 tb gin
1/2 ts sugar
1/4 ts white pepper
2 ts thin soy sauce
1 tb cornstarch paste
12 ea chicken breast
12 ea slices giant bamboo shoot
12 ea slices carrot
12 ea thinly sliced broccoli
2 c  shredded lettuce
2 ea medium potatoes
1/2 ts salt
4 c  oil for deep frying
3 ea slices fresh ginger
Preparation:  Slice bamboo shoot across grain into 2" triangles.  Peel
& slice carrots on bias.  Remove strings from peas & wash.  If
substituting broccoli, use peeled stems only; slice thinly on bias.
Shred lettuce; arrange like nest on round 10" serving plate.
Making Potato Basket:  Peel, then coarsely shred potatoes.  Or, slice
potatoes into thin matchsticks.  Rinse potatoes in cold water twice;
soak them 30 minutes in cold salted water; rinse & drain.  Slowly heat
deep-frying oil in wok to medium hot; test potato slice:  it should
brown in 30 seconds.  Dust potatoes with cornstarch so they will stick
together when fried.  Arrange them in a cross-hatch pattern on Chinese
wire strainer or other suitable strainer to form deep basket.  Press
them in position with another strainer.  If you use bowl for pressing,
heat it first, because you don't want to cool frying oil.  Immerse in
oil & deep-fry until potatoes begin to brown.  Remove from oil; take
away top strainer only; drain; reserve.
When ready to serve, heat oil to very hot, but not smoking; deep-fry
potatoes in strainer again until they are brown & crisp.  Place basket
in nest of lettuce.
Blanching:  Dip scallops in hot but not boiling water; remove in 15
seconds when scallops are warmed: don`t allow them to cook.
Stir-frying:  As you heat wok to medium hot, stir-fry ginger slices &
garlic to flavor wok; remove when they start to brown; discard.  When
wok is hot, add peanut oil & salt; stir.  Add bamboo shoots & carrots;
stir-fry 1 minute.  Add stock.  When stock boils, add scallops, snow
peas, sugar, white pepper, gin & soy sauce.  Stir 1 minute.  Add
cornstarch paste to thicken.  Transfer to potato basket. Serve.
