Split and stone the fresh apricots and chop roughly.  If using dried
apricots, put them to swell overnight in water.  Boil the chopped onions
for a few moments to soften them, otherwise you always seem to get a few
hard bits.  Drain.  Put all the ingredients except the walnuts into a large
preserving pan and bring to the boil.  Turn down the heat and cook gently,
stirring regularly, for 1 1/2 hours until the mixture is thick and jammy.
Stir in the walnuts.  Pot while hot in warm sterilised jars. Seal. Makes
about 6 lbs.
