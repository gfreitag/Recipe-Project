seeds, this bread is a winner!
Preheat the oven to 350. In a large bowl combine flours, oatmeal, brown
sugar, orange peel, baking powder, baking soda and light salt until well
blended. Add milk and egg white; stir only until ingredients are
moistened. Fold in the sunflower seeds. Lightly oil a 1 1/2 Qt. casserole

Bake for 50-60 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center of bread
comes out clean. If necessary, cover loaf with foil during the last 15
minutes of baking to prevent overbrowning. Cool in casserole for 10
minutes; turn bread onto wire rack. Brush top of loaf with 1 teaspoon of
honey and sprinkle with additional 1 tablespoon of sunflower seeds, if
desired. Serve warm or cool.
