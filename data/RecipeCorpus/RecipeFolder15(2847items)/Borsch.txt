over low heat for about 1 1/2 hours.
Scrub beets for soup and cook in boiling water until tender, about 45
minutes; drain and discard water; cool.  Peel and cut each beet into
eighths.  Scrub small beets; grate; cover with water to soak.
Remove meat from soup; set aside.  Strain soup into another pot and
add cooked beets, cabbage, leeks, potatoes, tomatoes, tomato paste,
vinegar, sugar, beef and bacon.  Bring to a boil and simmer 45
minutes.
Cut kielbasa into chunks and add with navy beans to soup.  Simmer 20
minutes more.
Mix flour and butter together to form paste.  Stir into soup to
thicken slightly.  Strain raw beets, saving liquid and discarding
beets.  Add beet liquid to soup.
Additional sugar or vinegar may be added for sweeter or more sour
flavor.  Slice meat and arrange in individual soup bowls.  Pour hot
soup with vegetables over meat.  Garnish each serving with a dollop of
sour cream, if desired.  Serves 10
