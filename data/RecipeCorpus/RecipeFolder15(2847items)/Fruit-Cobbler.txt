Title: Fruit Cobbler
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Milk
1 c  Self rising flour
*optional sugar to taste
2 c  Fresh* or canned fruit
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
-(don't use shortening)
1 c  Sugar
If you are using fresh or frozen fruit bring it to a boil with optional
sugar and a little water on the stove. Reduce heat and cook until it begins
to form a light syrup.  You do not want a lot of liquid and if using canned
fruit you should drain it first.  Canned fruit does not need to be
sweetened as above.  Select a deep baking dish, preferably one which can be
heated on top of the stove.  Melt the butter in you dish over low heat. In
a separate bowl mix together the milk, sugar, and flour to form a batter.
Carefully pour the batter into the center of the melted butter and do not
stir.  Next pour the fruit into the middle of the butter-batter and do not
stir.  Bake on 350 F until the crust rises and turns a rich golden brown.
