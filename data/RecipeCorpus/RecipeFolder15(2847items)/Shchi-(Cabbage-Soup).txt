Approx. Cook Time: 8:00 Soak the porcini in 1 cup water for 2 hours. Drain
them, pat dry with paper towels, chop fine, and set aside. Discard the
liquid or save for another use. To make the stock, in a large soup pot,
bring the meat, bones, and water to a boil over high heat, periodically
skimming off the foam as it rises to the top. Add the remaining stock
ingredients, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer, covered, until the meat is
tender; about two hours. Meanwhile, melt half the butter in a deep skillet
over medium heat. Add the cabbage and sauerkraut and saute for 10 minutes,
tossing and stirring regularly.  Add one cup hot stock (it doesn't have to
be fully cooked) and the tomato paste. Cover and simmer over low heat for
35 to 40 minutes. Melt the remaining butter in another large skillet and
saute the carrot, onions, celery, turnip, and mushrooms until soft and
lightly browned; about 15 minutes. When the stock is ready, strain it into
a clean pot.  Reserve the meat and discard the other solids. Add the
sauerkraut and cabbage, the vegetable mixture, and tomatoes to the stock.
Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook, covered, over medium-low heat
for 20 minutes. Cut the meat into bite-size pieces and add it to the soup,
along with the minced garlic.  Simmer for another five minutes. Let stand
for at least 15 minutes, and preferably a day and a night, before serving;
refrigerate, covered, and reheat slowly if serving the next day. Serve
garnished with fresh dill and sour cream, if desired.
