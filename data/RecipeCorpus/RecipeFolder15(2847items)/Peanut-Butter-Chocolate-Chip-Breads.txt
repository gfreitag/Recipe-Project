batter until it is just combined, and stir in the chocolate chips.
Divide the batter among 5 buttered and floured loaf pans, each 5 3/4

preheated 350 oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a tester comes out

sides up, on a rack.  The breads keep, wrapped well in plastic wrap
and foil, chilled for 1 week or frozen for 1 month.  Makes 5 small
loaves.
