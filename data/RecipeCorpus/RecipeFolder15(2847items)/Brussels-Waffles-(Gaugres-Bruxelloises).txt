Title: Brussels Waffles (Gaugres Bruxelloises)
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 4 servings
1    Egg, slightly beaten
1 tb Grated lemon peel
1/2 ts Lemon juice
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/8 ts Salt
1    Bottle beer
1/4 c  Oil
These waffles are a crisp type and are often served for dessert topped with
sweetened whipped cream and strawberries.  They became famous at the
Belgian pavilion at the 1962 New York Worlds Fair.  Mix flour and salt. Add
remaining ingredients. Beat just until smooth. Let batter sit 2 hours at
room temperature or refrigerate overnight. This makes the waffles more
tender.  Bake in a waffle iron following manufacturerUs directions. Spread
the batter thin and bake until crisp and browned. Serve for dessert or
breakfast.  Yield depends on size of waffle iron. For example, one that
makes 7-inch rounds will yield 4 large rounds that separate into 16
sections.
