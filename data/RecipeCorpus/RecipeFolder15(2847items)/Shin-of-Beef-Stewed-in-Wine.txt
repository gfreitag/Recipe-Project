Title: Shin of Beef Stewed in Wine
Categories: Meats, French
Yield: 6 servings
1 ea Bouquet garni
8 oz Red wine (or more)
1 ts Salt
8 oz Beef stock or water
6 oz Fat bacon or salt pork
1 ea Large onion
1 tb Olive oil
5 lb Shin beef off the bone
2 ea Cloves garlic
Cut the bacon or salt pork into small cubes and put them, with a tablespoon
of olive oil, into a heavy and fairly wide iron or earthenware pot. When
the bacon fat runs, add a large sliced onion and stir about until slightly
brown.  On top, arrange the shin of beef, off the bone, skinned, excess fat
removed, and cut lengthways into thick pieces. Add the cloves of garlic,
crushed but not chopped, and the bouquet garni (either one of the "instant"
ones, or a small bunch of parsley, thyme and bayleaf, tied up with a
string).  Pour in a large glass of red wine (about 8 oz) and let all come
to a fast boil for 4-5 minutes. Add about the same amount of beef stock or
water, and allow to boil again.  Add salt. . Cover the pot with paper or
foil and a well-fitting lid. Transfer to a very slow oven, 290 degrees F or
gas mark 1, and in about 3 hours it will be cooked.
Or you can half-cook it one day, remove it, and finish it the next. Serve
with potatoes or rice to soak up the sauce. (Egg noodles also work well if
you thicken the sauce slightly.) This dish can also be simmered *very*
slowly on top of the stove.
