Categories: Crackers, Breads, Snacks
Yield: 12 servings
2 tb freshly grated Parmesan chee
1 ts baking powder
3/4 ts salt
1/3 c  plus 1 tablespoon water
2 tb olive oil
1/3 c  shredded carrot
2 tb minced onions
2 tb minced dried mushrooms
1 tb minced sundried tomatoes (No
2 ts dried basil
2/3 cu unbleached flour
2/3 cu semolina flour
Preheat the oven to 250F.  Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Spread the carrot over the paper; top with the onion.  Bake for about
30 minutes to dry out the vegetables.  Cool on the baking sheet on a
wire rack.  Reduce oven temperature to 350F.  In a large bowl, combine
the dried carrots and onion with the mushrooms, tomatoes, and basil.
Add the unbleached and semolina flours, the cheese, baking powder, and
salt; mix well with a fork.  Make a well in the center.  Add the water
and oil.  Mix with a wooden spoon until the dough begins o gather.
(If the dough is slightly dry add another tablespoon of water.) Knead
with hands into a ball.  Roll the dough between the palms of hands
into a thick rope.  Wrap in waxed paper and chill for 15 minutes.
After the dough has chilled, cut it into 12 equal pieces.  Working
with one piece at a time (keep the remaining dough covered), shape
into a ball.  Place the ball of dough between two pieces of lightly-
floured waxed paper and roll out to a 4 to 5 inch circle.  Remove the
waxed paper and place the circle on a large baking sheet.  Repeat with
the rest of the dough.  The crackers can touch as they do not spread
during baking.  Bake for 15 minutes at 350F, or until lightly golden
but not brown.  Cool on wire racks.  Store in an airtight container.
These big, thin, golden wafers are streaked with vegetable pieces.
Makes 12 crackers.
