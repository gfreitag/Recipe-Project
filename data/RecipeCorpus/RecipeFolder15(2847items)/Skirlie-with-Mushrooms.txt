Title: Skirlie with Mushrooms
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Medium oatmeal
Salt and black pepper
8 oz Mushrooms (wild if possible)
5 oz Good meat dripping
2    Onions
Skirlie is only worth making with good drippings from roasted meat.
Chrissie remembers that sometimes the cook at the big house would dole out,
to people who wanted it, the wonderful dripping that had been used for the
umpteen big roasts.  I like skirlie as a kind of risotto, with wild
chanterelles that grow in profusion all over the island.  The mixture makes
an excellent stuffing for a boned shoulder of lamb.

Wipe and slice the mushrooms.  Skin and slice the onion thinly.

Fry the mushrooms in 1 oz dripping in a wide frying pan.  Remove them and
reserve.  Heat the rest of the dripping.  Fry the onion.  When the onions
are soft but not brown, turn up the heat.

Add the oatmeal, turn it in the drippings and brown a bit.  Throw in the
mushrooms.  Add salt and black pepper to taste.  Serve hot.
