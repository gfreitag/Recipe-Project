Cook until tender. Drain off all of the water, add the 3 Tbsp of butter,
salt and pepper to taste, parsley and onion. Mix well. Beat the eggs, add
to potatoes and beat mixture lightly. Let stand until pastry is made. Sift
together the flour, baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. Work in the 4 Tbsp of

form a semi-circle, pressing edges together with prongs of fork. Drop into
the hot meat and broth, cover pot closely and boil about 25 minutes. While
these are cooking make a sauce of the 3 Tbsp of butter or bacon drippings,
add the bread cubes and brown. Stir in the milk. Arrange the "Boova
Shenkel" on a platter and pour over all the milk sauce. Serve at once.
