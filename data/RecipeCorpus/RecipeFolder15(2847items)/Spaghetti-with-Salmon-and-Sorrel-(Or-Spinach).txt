Title: Spaghetti with Salmon and Sorrel (Or Spinach)
Categories: Fish, Pasta
Yield: 2 servings
8 oz Fresh spaghetti
Lemon juice and butter
2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
4 oz Cooked and flaked salmon
1 oz Fresh sorrel (or spinach) *
2 oz Broccoli florets
*Note: Amount given for sorrel (or spinach) is for trimmed weight.

Take some sorrel or spinach leaves and roll them up tightly, a few at a
time.  Snip across with scissors to make fine green ribbony shreds.  Chop
the broccoli florets into very small pieces indeed, and bring a large pan
of salted water to the boil for cooking the pasta.

Melt 2 oz butter in a flameproof casserole suitable for bringing to table.
Add the broccoli, stir to coat with fat, cover with a lid and cook gently
for just 1 minute.  Add a very generous grinding of pepper, some salt and 2
teaspoons lemon juice (or quite a bit more lemon if using spinach). Shake
the casserole to distribute the flavourings, then scatter the flaked fish
over the broccoli but do not stir it in.  Cover and leave over very gentle
heat for just 3 minutes or so.  Meanwhile cook the pasta.

Draw the casserole away from the heat.  Add the well drained pasta, the
Parmesan and most of the sorrel or spinach ribbons.  Toss quickly, gently
and thoroughly so that every strand of pasta is anointed with butter and
prettily flecked with the pink and green of the salmon and vegetables.
Check the seasoning, sprinkle the remaining ribbons of greenery over the
top and serve straight away, accompanied by wedges of lemon instead of the
ubiquitous bowl of grated Parmesan cheese.
