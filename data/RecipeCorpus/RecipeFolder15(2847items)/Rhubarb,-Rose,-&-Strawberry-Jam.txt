Title: Rhubarb, Rose, & Strawberry Jam
Categories: Misc
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 lb Highly scented rose petals
1 1/2 lb Sugar
4 sm Juicy lemons
2 lb Rhubarb, trimmed weight
1 lb Small strawberries
-- slightly underripe
Rhubarb is an unreliable setter so the inclusion of lemon juice in this
recipe is essential and I like to play it safe by cooking the lemon pips
with the fruit in order to extract their pectin.  Slice the rhubarb and
layer it in a large bowl with the whole hulled strawberries and the sugar.
Pour on the lemon juice, cover and leave overnight.

Tip the contents of the bowl into a preserving pan.  Add the lemon pips
tied in a muslin bag and bring gently to a boil.  Boil for 2 minutes then
tip the contents of the pan back into the bowl.  Cover and leave in a cool
place over night once more.

Put the rhubarb and strawberry mixture back into the pan.  Pinch out the
white tips from the bases of the rose petals and add the petals to the pan,
pushing them well down among the fruit.  Bring to the boil and fast boil
until setting point is reached, then pot in warm sterilised jars in the
usual way. Makes enough to fill 6 or 7 jars.
