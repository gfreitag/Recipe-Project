Title: Trimlestown Roast Sirloin (Irish)
Categories: Meats, Irish
Yield: 4 servings
1 oz Butter
2 oz Flour
1 x  Salt and pepper
3 lb Sirloin roast
2 fl Whiskey
10 fl Red wine
Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Wipe meat, season and place in a roasting pan.
Place pan in oven and cook for one hour. Add the whiskey and wine to the
pan. Cook for a further hour, basting once more. Remove the roast from the
pan, place on a serving dish and keep warm. Pour off excess fat from the
meat juices, adding water to bring to about 15 oz.  Beat the butter into
the flour to form a smooth paste.  Add a little of the juices to this and
mix well, then pour onto juices, mixing again, and bring to the boil.
Simmer gently for 2-3 minutes to cook flour.  Correct the seasoning. If
the sauce is too thick, add a little more water.  Serve separately in a
gravy boat.  Jacket or mashed potatoes, and a cooked green vegetable
(possibly broccoli) go well with this, since the sauce is so rich.
