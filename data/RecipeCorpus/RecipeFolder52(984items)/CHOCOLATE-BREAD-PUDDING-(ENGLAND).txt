Categories: Breads, Chocolate
Yield: 6 Servings
3    Squares (1 oz each)
-unsweetened chocolate, cut
-into
Small pieces
2 c  Half-and-half
2 c  Loosely packed soft white
-bread crumbs
2    Jumbo eggs
1 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1 pn Salt
1 c  Heavy cream, whipped
HEAT THE CHOCOLATE AND CREAM in a large saucepan over low heat for
12-15 minutes, stirring frequently until chocolate is completely
melted. Remove pan from the heat, stir in the crumbs, and let stand
for one hour. Preheat oven to 350F. Beat the eggs until frothy, blend
in the sugar, vanilla and salt, then mix the eggs into the chocolate.
Pour the pudding into a buttered 1 1/2-quart casserole, set it in a
shallow baking pan, and pour enough hot water into the pan to come
half-way up the sides of the casserole. Bake the pudding uncovered
for 50 to 60 minutes until the pudding is set like custard. To test
it, insert a toothpick in the center. If it comes out clean, pudding
is done. Serve the pudding warm, topped with dollops of whipped
cream. Serves 6. > Submitted By COCHRUN@FILEBANK.COM (DAVID COCHRUN)
