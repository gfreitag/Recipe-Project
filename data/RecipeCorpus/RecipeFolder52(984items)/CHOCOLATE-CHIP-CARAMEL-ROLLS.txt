In small bowl combine brown sugar, 2 T butter/margarine, and corn
syrup. Cook on 100% (high) for 1-2 mins. or until butter is melted
and brown sugar is dissolved. Stir to combine. Evenly divide mixture
among six 6-oz. custard cups. Set aside.

In mixing bowl stir together flour, wheat germ, and baking powder.
Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add milk all
at once; stir just until dough clings together. Turn out onto a
lightly floured surface. Knead gently 15-20 strokes. Roll into a 10"
x 6" rectangle. In a small bowl cook 1 T butter on high for 30-60
secs. or until melted. Brush over dough. Combine sugar and orange
peel; sprinkle over dough. Sprinkle chocolate pieces over dough.
Beginning from short side, roll up jelly-roll style.  Seal seams.

Slice into 1" pieces.  Place dough slices, cut side down, in custard
cups. Arrange cups in a circle in the microwave oven. Cook on high
for 2-3 mins. or until a wooden pick comes out clean, turning and
rearranging cups once after 1 min. Let cool 1 min. Loosen sides and
invert onto a serving plate. Spread any remaining caramel mixture
from cups onto rolls. Serve warm. Makes 6 rolls.
