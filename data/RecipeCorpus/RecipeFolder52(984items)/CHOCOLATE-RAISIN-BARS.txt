Title: CHOCOLATE RAISIN BARS
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 20 Servings
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 pn Salt
8 ts Potato flour
3/4 c  Butter
1/3 c  Raisins; chopped
8 oz Semisweet chocolate pieces
1/4 c  Vanilla sugar
Preheat oven to 350 F (175 C).  Sift all-purpose flour, salt, potato
flour and vanilla sugar into a medium-size bowl. Cut in butter until
mixture forms coarse crumbs; mix in raisins. Mix together to form a
soft dough. Roll out dough on a floured surface to a rectangle
slightly smaller than an 11" x 7" baking pan. Place rolled-out dough
in pan; press to fit. Smooth top; prick well.  Bake about 25 minutes
or until very lightly browned. Cool a few minutes. Using a sharp
knife, mark through surface of mixture with lines to use as a guide
for cutting.  Let cool in pan. Cut mixture in 20 squares; remove from
pan. Place chocolate in a small bowl over a pan of gently simmering
water; stir until melted and smooth. Line a baking sheet with foil.
Dip bars in chocolate, coating evenly; lift out with a fork and tap
gently on side of bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place on foil.
Place baking sheet in a cool place until chocolate sets. If desired,
any remaining chocolate can be piped over bars for decoration.
