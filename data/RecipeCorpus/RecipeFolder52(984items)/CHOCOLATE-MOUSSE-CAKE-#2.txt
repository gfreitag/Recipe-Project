Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Servings
16 oz Bittersweet chocolate
10 oz Sugar
8 oz Flour
5 oz Butter
10    Egg yolks
12    Egg whites
Melt the chocolate together with the butter in a saucepan over the
stove in a place not too hot. Beat the 10 egg yolks with 5 oz sugar
then add them to half of the melted chocolate. Beat 6 egg whites very
firm and fold the chocolate mixture into them, adding at the end the
8 oz of flour. Put into a butter and floured cake pan and bake for 45
minutes at low (250). Let cool. Beat the remaining 6 egg whites until
very stiff, adding 5 oz of sugar while beating.  Fold into them the
rest of the chocolate which must be hardly warm. Cover the cake with
the chocolate mousse. Then sprinkle over the top and the side grated
chocolate. Leave the cake in the refrigerator 2 hours before serving.
