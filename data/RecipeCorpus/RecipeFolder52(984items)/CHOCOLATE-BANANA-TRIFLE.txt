Prepare the chocolate pudding first. Place the milk, sugar and
chocolate in a medium saucepan. Cook, stirring, over medium heat
until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is on the verge of
boiling. Sift the cornstarch and cocoa powder together. Add water and
mix thoroughly. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the chocolate
mixture. Whisk in the whole eggs and the extra egg yolks. Cook until
thickened (about 5 minutes). Add the vanilla extract. Pour into a
bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and chill. Cut the chocolate cake into
3" squares. Layer half the pieces of chocolate cake in a large trifle
or other large glass bowl, cutting the pieces to fit. Arrange half of
the banana slices around the sides of the bowl and on top of the
cake. Spread half the chocolate pudding over the cake and around the
sides. Repeat the process with another layer of cake, more banana
slices and the rest of the chocolate pudding. Whip the whipping cream
and slather over the top of the topmost layer of chocolate pudding.
Sprinkle with slivered almonds and garnish with cherry halves. Chill.
