Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

With an electric mixer, in a medium size bowl, cream the butter and
sugar. Stir in the vanilla, grated chocolate, and pine nuts. Mix in
the flour and salt. Chill the dough.

When ready to bake, roll out the dough, on a floured surface, to a
1/4inch thickness. Cut out the cookies with a 2inch round cookie
cutter. Gather the scraps together and reroll the dough to cut out
more cookies. Place slightly apart on a nonstick baking sheet.

Bake for 10 minutes, or until the cookies are dry and firm. When
cool, dust the cookies with the powdered sugar.
