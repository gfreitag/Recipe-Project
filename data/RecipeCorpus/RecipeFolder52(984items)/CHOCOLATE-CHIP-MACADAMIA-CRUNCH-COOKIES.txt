Who else besides hillary Clinton uses vegetable shortening in
chocolate chip cookies? Thersa Monk and her 12-year-old daughter,
Krystal, of Germantown, MD., for two.

At least now. For years, the Monks used butter in their baking, but
when they saw an opportunity to compete in the Crisco American Baking
Celbration, they couldn't resist trying to concoct a recipe with
butter flavored Crisco.

The result: Chocolate Chip Macadamia Crunch Cookies, which won the
national $500 prize in the chocolate chip cookie contest in late
March.

*****

With an electric mixer, beat shortening, sugar, brown sugar, eggs,
vanilla and buttermilk for 3-5 minutes until very light and fluffy.
In a separate bowl, mix the flour, oatmeal, baking soda and salt. By
hand, add the shortening mixture and stir well. Add chocolate chips
and nuts and stir by hand.

Refrigerate for at least a half hour until the dough is firm. Drop
dough by the tablespoon, about 2" apart, onto a greased insulated
cookie sheet. Bake in a preheated 325'F. oven for 16-18 minutes until
the cookies are a light golden brown.

Cool cookies on baking sheet for a minute and then remove to cooling
rack.
