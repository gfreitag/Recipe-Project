Categories: Cakes
Yield: 16 Servings
5 x  Small bananas
3 oz Bittersweet chocolate
1 c  Cake flour *
2 tb Milk
3/4 c  Sugar
1 c  Crme patissire,
Recipe follows
Confectioners' sugar
* Sift and measure cake flour. Butter two, 8 in. round pans. Line
them with wax paper, butter the paper and flour the pans. Place two
bananas and the milk in a electric blender or food processor. Blend
at low speed until homogenized. Set aside. In top of a double boiler,
over hot, but not simmering water, melt the chocolate. Set aside.
Preheat oven to 325'F. Beat egg whites with 1/2 cup sugar until peaks
keep their shape. Set aside. Beat the yolks with the remaining 1/4 c
sugar until thick and ribbonlike. Fold the bananas and the chocolate
into the beaten egg yolk. Alternately, a third at a time, fold the
beaten egg whites and the flour into the chocolate mixture.  Mix only
until smooth. Do not overmix.
Divide batter equally between the prepared pans and bake in the
pr-heated, 325'F. oven until a knife inserted into the centre comes
out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool two minutes in the pans, then
gently invert on a cooling rack.
When cool, split each layer.  Peel and cut three banaas into 1/8 in.
segments.  Place banana slices on the cream. Assemble the cake with
the cream and banana slices between layers. Sprinkle the top with
confectioners' sugar.
