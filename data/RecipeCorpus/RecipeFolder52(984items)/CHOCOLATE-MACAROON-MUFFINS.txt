until fluffy. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until blended. In another
bowl, combine flour, cocoa, and baking powder; stir into butter
mixture until well mixed. Equally divide 1/2 the batter among 8
buttered or paper-lined muffin cups (2-to 2-1/2 in. diameter). To
each cup, add an equal portion of 1/2 of the macaroon filling. Next,
add equal portions of remaining chocolate batter, then top equally

muffins spring back when gently pressed and macaroon filling is
lightly browned, about 25 minutes. Let muffins cool in pan 10
