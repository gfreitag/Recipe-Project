egg white, milk, oil and vanilla. Make a well in the center of the
dry ingredients and gradually whisk in the liquid mixture, stirring
just until combined. Let the batter stand for 5 minutes, or
refrigerate for up to 1 hour. Heat a large non-stick skillet over
medium low heat. When hot, coat it lightly with non-stick cooking
spray. Drop 3 to 4 pancakes, using about 1 1/2 tablespoons batter per
pancake, into the pan and cook until the underside is browned and the
bubbles on top remain open, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Turn the pancakes
over and cook until the underside is browned, about 15 seconds.
Repeat with the remaining batter. Arrange the pancakes on dessert
plates. Top with scoops of frozen yogurt and Chocolate-Raspberry
Sauce. Garnish with raspberries.  Serves 2. CHOCOLATE-RASPBERRY
