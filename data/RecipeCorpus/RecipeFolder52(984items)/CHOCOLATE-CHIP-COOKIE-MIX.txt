Title: CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE MIX
Categories: Mix recipes, Chocolate, Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
9 c  Unbleached flour
4 ts Baking soda
2 ts Salt
3 c  Firm packed dark brown
Sugar
3 c  Granulated sugar
4 c  Buter flavor veg.
Shortening
4 c  Chopped pecans
4    12-oz  bags semi-sweet real
Chocolate chips
* be sure to use fresh
Nuts*
Combine flour, baking soda, salt and both sugars in very large bowl.
Mix in the shortening with your fingers. Stir in the chips and nuts.
Store whole mix in airtight container in a cool dry place for up to
six months. For longer storage refrigerate or freeze. **I package the
mix in individual zip-lock bags. TO MAKE THE COOKIES: Stir the mix to
distribute the nuts and chips and then, measure seven level cups of
the mix into a large bowl. (* spoon in and level, do not pack) Stir
to distribute the nuts and chips. Add two large eggs that have been
lightly beaten and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Blend well. This
creates a heavy batter, but don't worry it will work. Drop the batter
by tablespoonfuls on buttered baking sheets. Bake in preheated 375
oven for 10 - 12 minutes. Cool slightly on sheets and then transfer
to an airtight container. One batch makes about 2 dozen cookies.
