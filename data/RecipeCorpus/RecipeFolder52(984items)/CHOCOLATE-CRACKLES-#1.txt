Categories: Desserts, Australia
Yield: 6 Servings
8 oz Copha
8 oz Icing sugar
3 1/2 ts Cocoa
5 c  Rice Bubbles
1/2 c  Sultanas (optional)

NOTES:

*  A traditional Australian sweet snack -- Mention this recipe to an
Australian abroad and he will instantly get homesick. Yield: serves 6.

*  Rice Bubbles are called Rice Krispies in North America. Icing
sugar is confectioner's sugar. Sultanas are like raisins. Copha, it
would appear, is utterly unavailable outside Australia. It is a
partially-solidified shortening made of coconut oil.

: Difficulty:  easy if you can get the ingredients.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
