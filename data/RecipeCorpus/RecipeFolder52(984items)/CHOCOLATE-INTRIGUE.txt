1/2 ts Black Pepper

Preheat oven to 325.  Butter two 5-cup loaf pans and dust all over

In a small saucepan over moderate heat place both chocolates with the
coffee powder and water.  Whisk frequently until the chocolates are

baking powder, salt, and pepper and set aside.  In a large bowl, beat

minutes of baking. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 15 minutes,
then invert pan and cool the cake, upside down on a rack. (The bottom
of the cake is very moist and tender at this stage). Refrigerate and
serve.
