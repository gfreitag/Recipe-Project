Melt 8 oz to 1 lb semisweet chocolate in heavy pot over low heat.
Blow up as many balloons as cups you need. Use small balloons and
don't blow them up very big (Anne's note: in accompaning picture,
they are about the size of an apple.) Dab a little melted chocolate
onto a wax paper lined cookie sheet. Dip bottom of balloon in melted
chocolate and sit on cookie sheet. Refrigerate until hard. Repeat for
remaining balloons. If cups are very thin, dip again. When the
chocolate has hardened, snip the top of the balloon with scissors and
pull out gently from cup. Discard. Fill cups with chocolate mousse or
raspberry mouse for Valentine's Day or fill with ice cream. Here is a
possible filling: Puree raspberries in food processor with sugar.
Whip cream until stiff. Fold in raspberry puree.
