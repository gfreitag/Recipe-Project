MMMMM-------------------ALMOND MERINGUE CRISPS------------------------
3/4 c  Sliced almonds
1/2 c  Plus 2 T granulated sugar
2    Egg whites
1/8 ts Cream of tartar
1/8 ts Salt
1/2 ts Almond extract
1 ts Cornstarch
1 tb Confectioners' sugar
MMMMM---------------------CHOCOLATE GANACHE--------------------------
6 oz Semi-sweet chocolate;
-broken into 1/2-oz pcs.
7 tb Heavy cream
1 ts Granulated sugar
1 ts Unsalted butter
EQUIPMENT:  Measuring cup, measuring spoons, 2 baking sheets, food
processor with metal blade, electric mixer with balloon whip, rubber
spatula, parchment paper, pastry bag, double boiler, film wrap,
whisk, 1 1/2-qt saucepan, small stainless steel bowl, medium star tip

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Lightly toast the almonds on a baking
sheet in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and
cool to room temperature. Reduce the oven temperature to 225 degrees.
In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, coarsely
process the toasted almonds with 2 tablespoons of sugar into pieces
1/8 inch in size. Set aside until needed. Line two baking sheets with
parchment paper. Create a meringue by whisking the egg whites on
medium speed in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a balloon
whip. Whisk until frothy, about 1 minute. Add the cream of tartar and
salt, increase speed to high, and whisk until the egg whites begin to
stiffen, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. While continuing to whisk on high speed,
gradually add 1/2 cup granulated sugar. The egg whites should form
peaks that are stiff, but not dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add almond
extract and whisk on high for an additional 30 seconds. Remove the
bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to fold in the chopped
almonds and cornstarch.
