printed it - any recipes Kellogg's printed is available by calling
1-800-962-1413. The girl I talked to there was very nice and sent me
a packet of recipes. I had asked for the original Rice Krispies treat
recipes - the one with butterscotch instead of marshmallo. Not only
did she find it and give me the recipe, she offered to send it with
other recipes. 3 working days later I got a large manilla envelope
FULL of recipes and recipe books. I think she photocopied everything
in the file for me as well as threw in some recipe books for good
measure. As I have time, I'll post the ones I have.
