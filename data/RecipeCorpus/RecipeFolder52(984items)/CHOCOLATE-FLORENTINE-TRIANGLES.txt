Preparation Time: 0:50 1. Preheat oven to 375 F. To make chocolate
crust, in a food processor, combine flour, 2/3 cup sugar, cocoa, and
1 stick butter. Process until blended. With machine on, add 1/3 cup
cream through feed tube, processing until dough begins to cling
together in a ball. Press dough evenly over bottom of a foil-lined 10
x 15-inch jelly-roll pan. Refrigerate while preparing topping. 2. In
a medium saucepan, combine remaining 1 1/2 sticks butter, remaining
1/2 cup sugar, and remaining 1/3 cup cream. Cook over medium heat,
stirring often, until mixture boils. Boil 2 mins, stirring
constantly. Stir in orange zest, almonds, candied cherries, and
candied pineapple. Spread evenly over chilled crust. 3. Bake 15 to 20
mins, or until top is bubbly and golden. Let cool in pan before
cutting into 60 triangles or squares. Store in refrigerator.
