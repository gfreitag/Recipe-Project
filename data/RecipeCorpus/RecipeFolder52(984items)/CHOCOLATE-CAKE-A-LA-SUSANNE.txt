Melt the chocolate and the butter on low heat and mix with the
coffee. Whip the eggs and the sugar until fluffy and mix with the
hazelnuts, the flour and the vanilla. Grease a tin. Use greaseproof
paper (also greased) in the bottom to make the cake slip easier. Bake
in 200 centigrades for 35 minutes. Put the cake on a plate and let
cool a little before removing the greaseproof paper. Melt the
chocolate with the double cream on low heat until the icing is thick
and creamy. Put on the cake and decorate with walnuts.
