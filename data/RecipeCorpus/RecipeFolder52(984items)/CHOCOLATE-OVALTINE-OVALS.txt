Title: CHOCOLATE OVALTINE OVALS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 80 Servings
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
2 c  Ovaltine
2 ts Cocoa
1/4 ts Salt
8 tb (1 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
1/2 c  Milk
"These delicate dark wafers are light, but rich in chocolate taste.
Not too sweet, they are the perfect complement for a dish of French
vanilla ice cream. 325~F. 14 to 18 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.

Combine the flour, Ovaltine, cocoa, and salt in a large bowl or in
the food processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
coarse meal.

Blend in the milk to form a dough that will hold together in a
cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch thick. With a cookie
cutter or the rim of a glass, cut into 2-inch circles. To make oval
shapes, roll over each cracker gently along one axis with your
rolling pin.

Place the crackers on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
sheet. Prick each one all the way through with the tines of a fork in
2 or 3 places. Bake for 14 to 18 minutes. Cool on a rack. Yield:
75-80.

VARIATIONS: If you are a chocolate lover, double the amount of cocoa.
For fancy occasions, dust the tops of these ovals with powdered
(confectioner's) sugar before serving.
