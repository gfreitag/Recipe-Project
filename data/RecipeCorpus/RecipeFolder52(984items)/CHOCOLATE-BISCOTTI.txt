Title: CHOCOLATE BISCOTTI
Categories: Digest, Sept.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Flour
1/2 c  Sugar (or more)
1/2 c  Cocoa
2 ts Flavoring (I used raspberry;
Orange or almond would work
Nicely too)
2    Egg equivalents
3/4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
Splash of liquor to match
Flavoring (I used Chambord)
Combine flour, sugar, cocoa, salt and baking baking powder.
Separately, mix flavoring and eggs.  Combine. Add splash of liquor or
water as needed to have a sticky consi stency. If the mixture is too
stiff, it won't spread out properly.

Put this glob on a greased cookie sheet and arrange it into a log
about 15 inch es long and 1 1/2 - 2" wide. Bake at 350 for 25
minutes. Remove from oven, let cool a few minutes, then slice
diagonally into 1/2- 3/4" slices. I got 18 pieces from mine.  Place
the slices on their side and put back in the oven (300 degrees) for
15 minutes. Turn over and cook another 10-15 minutes.

If you can afford the fat, a small drizzle of semisweet chocolate is
wonderful on these when cooled. I used about 2 T. for all the cookies,
which added about 6 g. fat to the recipe or 1/3 g. fat each one.
