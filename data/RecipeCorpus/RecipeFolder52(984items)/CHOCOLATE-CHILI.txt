1.   cook meat about 20 minutes until they lose pink color but not
browned (I personally don't know what that means, since it goes from
brown to pink...) Transfer to a bowl. 2. heat oil in same pan and
sautee onions 10 to 20 minutes, until `translucent.
3.  stir meat into onions.  Add tomatojuice (I used puree instead
cause I had it),  3 cups of water, the chili powder, cumin, oregano,
cocoa, cinnamon, and salt. (Ann is going to cut down on the cinnamon
next time but I didn't think it was too much at all) Blend. Bring to
boil, uncovered, for an hour. 4. taste for sea- soning, add more
chili powder if you like (in my opinion, you can add  more of
ANYTHING if you like) 5. Stir in the garlic, corn- meal, and beans.
Simmer for 10 minutes. Serve with garnishes (I usually serve rice but
did this for a change & loved it). Deb for serving:
chopped onion, shredded lettuce,  flour  tortillas (but I ate it
with pimento instead of onion -- it was prettier and delicious) with
pimento instead of onion ~- it was prettier and delicious)
