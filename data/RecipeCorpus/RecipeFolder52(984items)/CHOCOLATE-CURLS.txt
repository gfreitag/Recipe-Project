The secret to successful curls is chocolate at the proper temperature,
slightly warm but still firm. On a warm day, room temperature might be
fine. Place unwrapped chocolate bar on cookie sheet. Place in cooled
oven until warm. (Or place in microwave oven on HIGH (100%) 30
seconds or just until chocolate feel slightly warm) With even
pressure, draw vegetable peeler along underside of chocolate; a curl
will form.. Use wooden pick to lift curl onto wax paper-covered tray.
Refrigerate until firm. Use side of b ar for narrow curls. Use width
of one or tow blocks for medium-size curls. Use entire width of bar
of large curls.

NOTE: Chocolate curls can be refrigerated in covered container and
stored for later use.
