Title: CHOCOLATE BANANAS
Categories: Dessert, Campfire fo
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Small sweet ripe bananas
1 ts Lemon juice
4 oz Chocolate rice
-or sweet chocolate chips
-or chocolate slices
Peel bananas and squirt a little lemon juice on them to prevent
turning brown. Slice the peeled bananas length-wise into half and
stuff the chocolate filling into them, like you would do to a hot
dog. Sprinkle some nuts if you like. Wrap the bananas individually in
aluminium foil paper until they are all tightly wrapped up. Bring to
campfire, throw INTO the embers (the red hot burnt charcoals) for 5
minutes. Open up the foil, the chocolate would have melted, the banas
soft & "baked" and the nuts add a crunchy texture. Enjoy!!
