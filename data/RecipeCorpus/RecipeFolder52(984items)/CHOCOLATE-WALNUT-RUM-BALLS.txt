Title: CHOCOLATE WALNUT RUM BALLS
Categories: Candies, Alcohol, Resort, Holidays
Yield: 1 Lot
1 c  Walnuts, ground or
- finely chopped
2 c  Grated "German's sweet" or
- bittersweet chocolate
1 1/2 c  Sifted confectioner's sugar
4 tb Rum
Cocoa powder
Combine nuts, sugar, and chocolate. Moisten with rum to form a stiff
dough. Form into small balls and roll in cocoa to coat.

This recipe is not only simple, it's flexible. It can be made with
other kinds of liquor (amaretto, sherry, and Southern Comfort work
well), nuts (almonds or pecans, for instance) and coatings (ground
nuts, finely grated coconut, etc.) and always comes out tasting
great. Adding small chunks of nut for texture is also effective.
These usually disappear in a hurry.

This is a recipe for rum balls that I got from Monica Fischler in
Guayaquil, Ecuador in 1974. It's very simple, requires no cooking,
and is almost impossible to foul up.
