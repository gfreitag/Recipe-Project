Title: CHOCOLATE COVERED ANTS
Categories: Snacks, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1742 lg Ants, (if they are sm.,
-use 2,044)
3 c  Melted chocolate
Catch ants at a picnic site and keep them in a glass jar to which you
have added a teaspoon of sugar to keep them happy. (Unhappy ants are
liable to go sour before processing.) At home, pick up each ant with
tweezers and remove entrails with a small, very sharp knife edge.
This will take about 400 hours.  If you are in a hurry, eliminate
this step; you'll never know the difference. Dip each ant into melted
chocolate and place to drain on waxed paper.  If any of them are
still able to crawl off the paper, let them go -- be a good sport!!
