Title: CHOCOLATE VELVET PUDDING
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-========================
Ingredients:

gelatine 1/3 cup milk 1/3 cup cocoa 2/3 cup sugar 1/3 cup
4 tsp
water 11oz tin  evaporated milk 1 tsp vanilla Chill the evaporated
milk in the fridge for several hours. (It will not beat up well if it
is at room temperature) Measure out the gelatine carefully. Add the
milk. Stir well, then leave to stand for 5 minutes. In a medium sized
saucepan mix the cocoa, sugar and water. Bring to the boil, stirring
constantly. Remove from the heat and add the softened gelatine. Stir
until the gelatine has completely dissolved. Stand the chocolate
mixture in cold water to cool but DO NOT let it set.  Beat the
evaporated milk until very thick. Add the cooled chocolate mixture
gradually, then;

(a) Turn into one large dish to set.

(b) Spoon into individual dishes.

(c) Spoon mixture into glasses or individual dishes alternately with
spoonfuls of whipped cream and/or raspberries or stewed peaches.

(d) Spoon into a mould that has been wiped with cooking oil to prevent
sticking.  Leave to set. Colour darkens and flavour becomes more
marked if pudding is left for several hours.  To unmould, loosen
edges with fingers, then loosen one side and turn onto a dampened
plate. DO NOT stand the mould in warm water unless all else fails.
