YOU SHOULD NEVER TRY TO MAKE TOFFEE (OR ANY OTHER COOKED CANDY, FOR
THAT MATTER) IN DAMP WEATHER, BECAUSE THE CANDY WILL NOT HARDEN
PROPERLY. Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and 1/2 cup of cream in a
large saucepan set over moderate heat. Stir the mixture until the
sugar dissolves completely. Insert a candy thermometer, reduce the
heat to low, and cook the syrup, stirring frequently, until the
thermometer registers 238F. Blend in another 1/2 cup of the cream,
which will cause the temperature to drop, and continue to cook and
stir until the thermometer reaches 236 F or until a bit of the hot
toffee dropped into a little cold water forms a soft, pliable ball.
Mix in the remaining 1/2 cup cream and the melted chocolate. Cook the
toffee, stirring constantly lest it scorch. Cook toffee until the
mixture becomes quite thick: A drop of it should firm up quickly in
cold water. (NOTE: Even though the temperature of the toffee may not
exceed 230F, if it firms in cold water, remove the pan from the heat
at once.) Quickly mix in the vanilla and salt, then pour the toffee
into a well-buttered 8-by-8-by-2-inch pan. Cool the toffee
completely, then cut it into 1-inch squares. Wrap each one in waxed
paper or plastic wrap. Makes 64 candies.
