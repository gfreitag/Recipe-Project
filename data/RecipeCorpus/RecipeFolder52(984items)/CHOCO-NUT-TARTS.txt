Filling:
Yield: 1 Servings  :
:
1/2 c  salted butter
6 oz unsweetened baking
chocolate
:
2 lg eggs
1 c  dark brown sugar
1/2 c  dark corn syrup
2 ts vanilla extract
1 1/2 c  walnuts -- chopped
Topping:
:
24    walnut halves
1/2 c  heavy cream
1/4 c  white sugar
1 ts almond extract

Filling: In saucepan combine butter and chocolate and stir over low
heat. Pour into bowl and let cool 5 minutes. Using an electric mixer,
beat eggs into chocolate. Add sugar, corn syrup and vanilla and blend
until smooth. Fold in walnuts.

To assemble: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Roll out dough on floured
board to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut dough in circles to fit 2 1/2 inch
tartlet pans, cut a bit larger than pans are. Repeat with remaining
dough. Lay dough in pans and press firmly. Fill pans 2/3 full of
filling and place on baking sheet to catch any overspill. Bake 30
minutes or until filling is set. While tartlets are still warm, place
one walnut half in center of each.

Topping: In chilled bowl with chilled beaters, beat cream, sugar and
almond extract, until stiff peaks form. Do not overbeat. Put whipped
topping in pastry bag and using a star tip, pipe decorative topping
onto each tartlet.
