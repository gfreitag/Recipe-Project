Categories: Candies
Yield: 8 Servings
-Robbie Shelton XXXJ77A
8 oz Dark Couverture Chocolate
8 lg Eggs
1 c  Heavy Cream
1/2    Stick Butter
1/2 c  Hazelnut Chocolate Spread
-(Nutella)
To prepare the eggs, allow them to warm to room temperatures, wash and
shake each one well.  With a sharp knife, remove a small piece of sh
ell from one end and puncture the other end of each egg with a
needle. Remove the yolks and whites by blowing through the small
hole. Rinse the shells with water and allow to dry. Place them, large
hole up, in an empty egg carton.

Cut the chocolate into small pieces.  Bring the heavy cream to the
boiling point in a saucepan, add the chocolate and stir with a whisk
until the chocolate is melted and well blended. Remove from the heat
and add the butter and hazelnut chocolate spread.  Whisk until
blended.

Using a small funnel, pour the filling, while still warm, into the egg
shells and refrigerate.

Serve the eggs in egg cups.
