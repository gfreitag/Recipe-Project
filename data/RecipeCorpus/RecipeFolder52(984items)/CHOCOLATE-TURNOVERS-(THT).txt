Recipe by: TOO HOT TAMALES SHOW #TH6287 Preheat the oven to 400
degrees.

Place the puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Sprinkle the
pastry with a little flour and roll out to form a 12inch square.
Brush away any excess flour and trim the edges to make a perfect
square.

Cut the puff pastry into nine 3 1/2inch squares. Transfer them to a
parchment lined baking sheet.

In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and heavy cream. Neatly
brush a little of the egg wash along 2 of the edges of each square.
Place the chocolate, divided equally, and 1/4 teaspoon of the almonds
on each square. Fold down the unwashed edges to enclose the
chocolate, forming a triangle. Using your fingers, gently but firmly
press the puff pastry edges together to seal them.

Place the baking sheet in the freezer for 20 minutes, or until the
pastry is thoroughly chilled. Remove from the freezer and brush the
tops of the turnovers with the remaining egg wash.

Place in the oven and bake until the turnovers are puffed and golden,
about
15    minutes.
