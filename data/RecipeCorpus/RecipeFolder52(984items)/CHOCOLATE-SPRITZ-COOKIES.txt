Preheat oven at 350.  Prepare a cookie sheet with cooking spray. In a
mixing bowl, beat margarine, sugar, egg white, chocolate, and vanilla
until well blended.  Beat in flour andsalt until dough is smooth,
scraping down side of bowl frequently with rubber spatula. Spoon
dough into cookie press fitted with template of desired shape. Press
cookies 2 " apart onto prepared cookie sheets. Bake 10 to 12 minutes,
or until firm. NOTES : When baking on metal , especially at high
temperatures, cookies have a tendency to brown on the bottoms before
centers are done. By stacking two baking sheets together you put an
extra layer of metal under them as well as a thin cushion of air. The
effect is to slow the heat and allow more even baking. Recipe By
