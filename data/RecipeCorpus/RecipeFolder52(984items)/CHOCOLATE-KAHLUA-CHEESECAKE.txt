Title: CHOCOLATE KAHLUA CHEESECAKE
Categories: Cheesecakes, Chocolate, Desserts
Yield: 10 Servings
1 1/2 c  Chocolate wafer (I used
-Teddy Grahams) crumbs
1/4 c  Melted butter
2 tb Sugar
1 3/4 c  Semi-sweet chocolate
-chips/chunks, divided
1 c  Whipping cream
1/4 c  + 2 Tbsps. Kahlua, divided
24 oz Cream cheese, softened
1 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Cocoa
3    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 tb Powdered sugar
Mix crumbs, butter, and sugar. Press onto bottom and up the sides
partway of a 9-inch springform pan. Freeze 5 minutes, then bake at
350F for ten minutes and allow to cool. Heat in a bowl or pan over
boiling water 2/4 cup chocolate chunks until melted and smooth. Add
1/4 cup whipping cream and 1/4 cup Kahlua and stir until blended. In
another bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until fluffy. Add first
mixture to the second and blend well. Add eggs one at a time, mixing
well after each addition, and vanilla. Pour over prepared crust and
bake 10 minutes at 400F. Decrease to 275F and bake another 45
minutes. Remove from oven to cool: loosen cake from rim of pan and
remove. Melt remaining chocolate. Then add 1/4 cup whipping cream and
the 2 Tbsp Kahlua, mixing well. Spread on top of cake and refrigerate
six or so hours. Before serving, beat remaining whipping cream with
the powdered sugar and garnish cake by pipping it on (personally,
I'll probably skip this step) and decorating with a few remaining
chocolate chips (the picture of this is great!). Refrigerate
leftovers.
