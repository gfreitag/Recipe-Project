Title: CHOCOLATE NUT CAKE
Categories: Cakes, No-bake
Yield: 1 Cake
1/4 lb Butter (or margarine)
1 c  Icing sugar
2 lg Eggs
3/4 c  Cashews or almonds
2 1/2 ts Cocoa
1/2 lb Graham crackers
Milk
3/4 ts Vanilla
Cream together the butter and sugar.  Chop the nuts and roast if
desired.

Soak the crackers in the milk until they are soft but have not turned
to mush. Dissolve cocoa in about 2 T milk, and add this and the nuts
to the creamed butter/sugar mixture.

Separate the eggs and set the whites aside.  To the creamed mixture
add the yolks and  vanilla and beat. Whip the whites until stiff
peaks form, then fold this into the mixture.

Line a 9-inch square pan with a layer of crackers, mixture, and
crackers. Top with the remaining mixture and set in the refrigerator
until hard.

NOTES:

*  A no-bake graham-cracker chocolate cake -- This is a delicious,
easy-to-make cake that everyone enjoys. It came from an East Indian
friend of mine who said it had been in the family. It seems western
so I am uncertain of its origins.

*  Depending on how you want the texture of the cake you can soak the
crackers until they are slightly softened or until they fall apart.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
