This recipe came from the echo in my early days on it. I didn't
record who posted it.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously grease a 12 c bundt pan. Coat
sides with almonds.

In a large bowl, beat sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Add
eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each egg. Stir in chocolate
and almond extract.

Combine flour, corn meal, salt and baking powder.  Add alternately
with milk to chocolate mixture, mixing at low speed until well
blended. Spoon into pan.

Bake 50-60 minutes.  Cool 10 minutes.  remove from pan and cool on
rack.
