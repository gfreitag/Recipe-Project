1/2 c  Brandy
5 oz Semisweet chocolate

2/3 pk Dark choc. wafers (8 1/2-oz)

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
8    Eggs; separated
Sugar
2 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Salt

10 oz Unsweetened chocolate
2 oz Semisweet chocolate
3/4 c  Butter; softened
1/2 c  Coffee
1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
Soak cherries in 1/2 cup brandy and place in freezer. Melt 5 ounces
semisweet chocolate over hot water. When cherries are frozen, dry on
paper towel and quickly dip, one at a time, into chocolate, swirling
around by stem until completely covered. Chocolate will harden almost
immediately. Place on waxed-paper- lined rack in refrigerator until
ready to use.

To make crust, grind wafers in blender until crumbs are very fine.
Combine melted butter with crumbs and pat onto sides and bottom of
buttered 9-inch springform pan. Bake at 325F 10 minutes. Remove from
oven and cool completely.

Meanwhile, to make filling, combine egg yolks, 1 1/2 cups sugar,
vanilla, salt and 1/2 cup brandy in top of double boiler. Place over
simmering water and beat until pale yellow and thick, about 8 to 10
minutes. Remove from water and set aside. Melt unsweetened and 2
ounces semisweet chocolate in top of double boiler over hot water.
When melted, remove from water and beat in softened butter, a bit at
a time. Gradually beat chocolate into egg yolk mixture until smooth.
Chocolate mixture will congeal and become very stiff. Beat in coffee.
Beat egg whites (at room temperature) into soft peaks. Gradually beat
in 3 tablespoons sugar until stiff peaks form. Beat 1 cup of beaten
egg whites into chocolate mixture to thin, then carefully fold in
remaining beaten egg whites until thoroughly incorporated. Whip cream
until stiff and gently fold into chocolate mixture. Pour into
prepared crust and chill overnight in refrigerator. Garnish with
cherry cordials.
