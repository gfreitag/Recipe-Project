2/3 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Unsweetened coca powder
2 pk Rapid rise yeast
3/4 ts Salt
2/3 c  Milk

In large bowl, combine 1 cup flour, sugar, cocoa powder, undissolved
yeast and salt.  Heat milk, water and butter until very warm (120-130
degrees). Gradually add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium
speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add egg, vanilla
and 1/2 cup flour, beat 2 minutes at high speed, scraping bowl
occasionally. With spoon, stir in enough additional flour to make
soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and
elastic, about 4-6 minutes. Cover, let rest on floured surface 10
minutes. Divide dough in half. For body, knead chocolate morsels into
1 half, form into ball. Place on bottom end of large greased baking
sheet; flatten to make 5-inch round. For head, remove 1/3 of
remaining half, form into ball.  Place on large baking sheet above
body, flatten slightly, pinching to attach. For nose, pinch off 1/2
inch ball from remaining dough; place on center of head.  Divide
remaining dough into 4 equal portions, roll each to form 6-inch rope.
For arms, arrange 2 ropes across body; attach by tucking one end of
each under body. Shape remaining ropes into ears; arrange above head.
Attach by tucking one end of each under head.  Cover, let rise in
warm draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30-45 minutes.
Bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes or until done, covering
aluminum foil after 20 minutes to prevent excess browning. Remove
from sheet; cool on wire rack. Decorate as desired.
