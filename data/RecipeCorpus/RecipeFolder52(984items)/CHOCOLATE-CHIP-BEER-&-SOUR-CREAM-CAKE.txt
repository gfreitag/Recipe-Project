Categories: Desserts, Cakes
Yield: 8 Servings
3/4 c  Butter
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3 x  Eggs
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
2 c  Sour cream
3 c  Flour-unsifted all purpose
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
1/8 ts Salt
3/4 c  Beer
****combine****
3/4 c  Walnuts-chopped
3/4 c  Chocolate chips
1/2 c  Sugar
4 tb Cinnamon
Cream butter and sugar till fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time. Blend
well. Add vanilla and sour cream.  Blend till creamy. Add flour,
baking powder, baking soda, salt and beer. Blend well. In a small
bowl, combine nuts, chips, sugar and cinnamon.  Pour flour  mixture
into greased and floured tube pan.  You may alternate flour mixture
then nut and chip mixture. Or you may combine nuts and chip mixture
to flour mixture and pour all into pan.  I do the latter.  Bake at
350~ 50-60 minutes or till inserted knife comes out clean. Leave cake
in pan about 10 minutes then empty on to rack to cool. *I dust chips
with flour to prevent sticking. Source: Lynne Green-UAL
