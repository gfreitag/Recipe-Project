Title: CHOCOLATE MADELEINES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 24 Servings
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Grated lemon rind; OR
2 ts Grated orange rind
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 ts Salt
2/3 c  All-purpose flour
1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa
8 tb Butter; melted
-cooled slightly, plus
4 tb Butter; softened
PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Smear 1/2 teaspoon softened butter over the
inside of each madeleine form. Be sure to completely cover with
butter--don't leave spots. Combine the eggs, sugar and lemon or
orange rind in a large mixing bowl, and stir them together. Set in a
pan of simmering water and stir until the egg mixture is very warm to
your finger. Remove from the heat and beat with a mixer at high speed
until fluffy, pale yellow, and tripled in volume, about 3 minutes.
Add the vanilla and salt. Dump the flour and cocoa into a sifter or
strainer. Sift once, return to sifter or strainer and sprinkle half
of it over the egg mixture, and fold it in. Pour in 8 tablespoons of
butter and sprinkle on the remaining flour, and fold gently just
until the batter is mixed. Spoon a generous tablespoon of batter into
each prepared mold; do not spread it evenly; it will level itself in
the oven. Bake for about 10 minutes, until the edges of the cakes are
golden and they lift easily from the molds. (If you have only 1 pan,
and can bake only 12 at a time, let the mold cool, wipe it out,
grease with butter, then refill with batter and bake again.) Remove
from the oven, slipping the tines of a table fork under each cookie
to free it, and transfer the madeleines to a rack to cool. Serve
within a few hours, or wrap airtight and freeze. Serve plain, or
sprinkle the ribbed side with confectioners' sugar.
