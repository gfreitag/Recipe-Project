1    Stick (4 ozs.) margarine
1 1/2 c  Graham cracker crumbs
6 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
-(1 cup)
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
1 pk (18.25-ounce) devil's food o
-chocolate fudge cake mix
1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 1/2 tb Instant coffee powder
1/3 c  Sifted powdered sugar
Melt margarine in a medium saucepan over low heat, or in a 1-quart
glass bowl in a microwave oven on High 1 to 1-1/4 minutes. Stir in
graham cracker crumbs and let cool. When cool, stir in chocolate
chips and walnuts; set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and
flour two 9-inch round cake pans. Prepare cake mix according to
package directions. Turn batter into prepared pans. Sprinkle
crumb-walnut-chocolate chip mixture over cake batter, dividing evenly
between pans. Using fingertips or back of a spoon, lightly press
mixture into batter (crumb mixture should not sink all the way into
batter.) Bake cake as package directs (30 to 35 minutes), or until
cake tester inserted in center comes out clean. Remove cakes from
oven; let cool completely in pans before unmolding. Keep layers crumb
side up. In a medium bowl, beat cream, coffee powder, and powdered
sugar with an electric mixer on high speed until stiff. Place one
cooled cake layer, crumb side up, on a serving plate. Spread three
quarters of whipped cream mixture over cake. Top with remaining cake
layer, crumb side up. Frost sides of cake with remaining whipped
cream; do not frost top of cake. Refrigerate until serving time.
