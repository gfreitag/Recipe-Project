Categories: Cookies
Yield: 60 Cookies
2/3 c  Butter or margarine; soft
1 c  Sugar
1    Egg
1 ts Vanilla
1 1/4 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Quaker Oats, uncooked

Beat butter and sugar together until creamy.  Blend in egg and
vanilla. Sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Add to creamed
mixture; blend well.  Stir in oats.

Divide dough in half.  To one half, add melted chocolate; add peanuts
to remaining dough.  Roll out chocolate dough between two sheets of
waxed paper to form a 15x10-inch rectangle. Roll out peanut dough
between two sheets of waxed paper to form a 15x10-inch rectangle.

Place peanut dough on top of chocolate dough, removing all waxed
paper. Starting with long side, roll up as for jelly roll. Wrap in
waxed paper and chill several hours or overnight. Cut into 1/4-inch
slices. Place on ungreased cooky sheets.  Bake in preheated moderate
oven (350 F.) 10 to 12 minutes.
