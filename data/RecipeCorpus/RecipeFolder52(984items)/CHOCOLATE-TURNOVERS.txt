Title: CHOCOLATE TURNOVERS
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 9 Servings
1    Sheet frozen puff pastry,
Thawed -- 9-1/2" square
1    Egg yolk
2 tb Heavy cream
2 1/4 oz Semisweet chocolate -- cut
Into 9 pieces
Heat oven to 450#161#F. Place puff pastry on a lightly floured
surface. Sprinkle pastry with a little more flour and roll out to
form a 12-inch square. Brush away excess flour and trim edges to make
a perfect square.

Cut puff pastry into nine 3-1/2-inch squares and transfer them to a
parchment lined baking sheet. Discard excess.

In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolk and heavy cream. Neatly
brush a little of the egg wash along two adjacent edges of each
square. Place a piece of chocolate just below the center of each
square and fold down the unwashed edges to enclose chocolate and form
a triangle. Using your fingers, gently but firmly press puff pastry
edges together to seal.

Place baking sheet in freezer for 20 minutes, or until pastry is
chilled. Remove from freezer and brush tops liberally with remaining
egg wash. Place in oven and bake until triangles are puffed and
golden brown, about 15 minutes.
