Title: CHOCOLATE BREAD PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
3 oz Unsweetened chocolate
- cut into small pieces
2 c  Half and half
2 c  Soft white bread crumbs
- (loosely packed)
2    Jumbo eggs
1 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1 pn Salt
1 c  Heavy cream; whipped
HEAT THE CHOCOLATE AND half and half in a large saucepan over low
heat for 12-15 minutes, stirring frequently until chocolate is
completely melted. Remove pan from the heat, stir in the crumbs and
let stand for one hour. Preheat oven to 350F. Beat the eggs until
frothy, blend in the sugar, vanilla and salt, then mix into the
chocolate. Pour the pudding into a buttered 1 1/2-quart casserole,
set it in a shallow baking pan and pour enough hot water into the pan
to come halfway up the sides of the casserole. Bake the pudding
uncovered for 50 to 60 minutes until the pudding is set like custard.
To test it, insert a toothpick in the center. If it comes out clean,
pudding is done. Serve the pudding warm, topped with dollops of
whipped cream.
