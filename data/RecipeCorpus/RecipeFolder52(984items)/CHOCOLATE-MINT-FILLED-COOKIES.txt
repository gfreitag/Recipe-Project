Title: CHOCOLATE MINT-FILLED COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Chocolate
Yield: 48 Cookies
6 oz Chocolate pieces, semi-sweet
2 c  Flour
2/3 c  Butter; softened
1/4 c  Karo, light
2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1    Egg
Sugar
2 pk Andes mints; about 24 mints
ABOUT 4 HOURS BEFORE SERVING OR UP TO 1 WEEK AHEAD:

In a heavy small saucepan over low heat, heat semisweet chocolate
pieces until melted and smooth, stirring occasionally. In a large
bowl with mixer at low speed, beat melted chocolate, flour, butter or
margarine, corn syrup, baking soda, salt, egg, and 1/2 cup sugar
until blended. Increase speed to medium; beat until well mixed,
scraping bowl frequently with rubber spatula.  Wrap dough with
plastic wrap and refrigerate until easy to handle, about two hours
(or place dough in freezer 40 minutes).

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Measure 1/3 cup sugar into a small bowl. With
hands, shape dough into 96 balls; roll balls in sugar to coat. On
ungreased cookie sheets, place balls, about two inches apart.

Bake cookies 12 to 15 minutes until set.  Immediately remove half of
cookies from cookie sheets and invert onto work surface. While they
are still hot, place chocolate-covered mint patties on the cookies on
your work surface.  Then quickly top with remaining cookies, top-side
up, pressing cookies together slightly so the mint patty spreads out
to the cookie edges as it melts.  With a pancake turner, remove the
cookies to wire racks to cool.  Store cookies in a tightly covered
container to use up within 1 week.
