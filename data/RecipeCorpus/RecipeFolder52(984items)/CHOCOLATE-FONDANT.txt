2 c  Sugar
2 tb Light corn syrup
1/2 c  Water
2    1-oz squares unsweetened
-chocolate, melted & cooled
18    Pecan halves
3 oz White chocolate

wash sugar crystals from side of pan with pastry brush dipped in
water. Set candy thermometer in pan and boil syrup without stirring
to 242F (firm ball stage). Rinse large platter in cold water but do
not dry. Pour syrup on platter but do not scrape pan. Let stand 5
minutes or until surface feels just warm, moving platter a few times
to cool surface. Work candy with spatula or wooden spoon, scraping to
center of platter, until white and fim. Scrape from platter into
heavy or doubled plastic bags. Add melted unsweetened chocolate.
Close bag and knead until candy is well mixed, smooth, and clings
together. Shape in 1" balls. Press pecan halves into half the balls.
Coat remaining balls: Melt white chocolate in small saucepan over
very low heat, stirring occasionally. (Do not overheat ~ chocolate
will separate.) Spear fondant balls on fork and dip into white
chocolate. Tap fork against rim of pan to knock off excess chocolate.
Place balls on waxed paper to cool. Store airtight in cool, dry
place. Keeps about 1 month.
