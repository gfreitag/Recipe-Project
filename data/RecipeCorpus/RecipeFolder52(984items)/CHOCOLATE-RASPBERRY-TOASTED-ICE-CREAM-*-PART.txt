MMMMM--------------------DIRECTIONS CONTINUED-------------------------
While the cream is heating, place egg yolks and   th remaining sugar
in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat the eggs
on high for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl,
then beat on high until slightly thickened and lemon-colored, 2 1/2
to 3 minutes. (At this point, the cream should be boiling. If not,
adjust the mixer speed to low and continue to mix until the cream
boils. If this is not done, the egg yolks will develop undesirable
lumps.) Pour the boiling cream into the beaten egg yolks and whisk to
combine. Return to the saucepan and heat over medium-high heat,
stirring constantly. Bring to a temperature of 185 degrees, 2 to 4
minutes, then pour over the chocoate mixture, add crushed hazelnuts,
and stir to combine. Cool in an ice-water bath to a temperature of 40
to 45 degrees, about 15 minutes. en the custard is cold, freeze in an
ice-cream freezer following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer
the semi-frozen ice cream to a plastic container. Securely cover the
container, then place i the freezer for several hours before serving.
Serve within 5 day Makes 1 1/2 quarts
