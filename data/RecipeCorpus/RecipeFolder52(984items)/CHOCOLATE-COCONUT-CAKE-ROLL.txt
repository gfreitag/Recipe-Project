Preheat oven to 375 degrees; coat a 15 x 10-inch jelly roll pan with
nonstick cooking spray, line with waxed paper and coat paper with
cooking spray.  Beat egg and 2 tablespoons water in a large mixing
bowl at high speed for about 2 minutes, or until thick and pale.
Gradually add sugar, vanilla and remaining 1/4 cup water; beat well.
Combine flour, cocoa, coffee granules, baking powder and salt. Add
flour mixture to egg mixture; stir until blended. Beat egg whites
until stiff peaks form. Stir 1/4 of egg whites into chocolate
mixture; fold in remaining egg whites. Spread batter evenly into
prepared pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until cake springs back when
touched lightly in the center. Immediately loosen cake from sides of
pan, and invert onto a towel dusted with 2 tablespoons powdered
sugar. Peel off waxed paper. Starting at a short end, roll up towel
and cake together; cool completely on a wire rack, seam side down.
Unroll cake carefully, and remove towel. Spread Coconut Cream Filling
over cake. Roll up jelly roll fashion.  Place cake on a serving
platter, seam side down; cover with plastic wrap and chill for 1
hour.  Sprinkle cake with remaining tablespoon of sifted powdered
sugar.  (200 calories, 4g fat, 18% calories from fat)
