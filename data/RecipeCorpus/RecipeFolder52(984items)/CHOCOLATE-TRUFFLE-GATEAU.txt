Title: CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE GATEAU
Categories: Barry, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
3 oz Hazelnuts or Hazelnut pieces
10    Hazelnuts to decorate cake
3 oz Caster Sugar
4 oz Self-Raising Flour
3    Eggs
2 ts Instant Coffee
2 tb Soya Oil
1 ts Baking Powder
MMMMM--------------------BUTTER CREAM FILLING-------------------------
2 oz Softened butter
4 oz Icing Sugar
1 ts Instant Coffee Powder
-dissolved in 1 Tablespoon
-of water
Dissolve the instant coffee in two tablespoons of water. Put the 3
ounces of hazelnuts into a food processor and grind them to a fine
powder. Add all the other ingredients and whiz until you have a
lovely creamy mixture.

Grease and flour a 7-inch sandwich tin and pour in the mixture,
smoothing the top down. Pre-heat the oven to Gas Mark 4, 350F, 180C,
and bake for about 25 minutes, until the cake is brown and has shrunk
away from the sides of the tin.

To make the butter cream filling, all you do is either beat together
the butter, icing sugar and coffee until you have a smooth cream.
When the cake is ready, turn it out onto a rack, and when it has
cooled, split it into two and sandwich it together with the butter
cream filling. Alternatively, fill it with apricot jam and spread the
butter cream over the cake and decorate with the whole hazelnuts.
