Categories: Cookies
Yield: 48 Servings
1/4 c  Unsalted butter; softened
1/2 c  Powdered sugar; sifted
1 ts Vanilla extract
3    Egg whites; beaten
1/2 c  All-purpose flour; sifted
2 tb Unsalted butter; melted
MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
4 oz Semisweet chocolate; chopped
1/3 c  Finely shredded coconut
Preheat oven to 425 F (220 C).  Grease several baking sheets with
butter. In a medium-size bowl beat 1/4 cup butter with powdered sugar
until creamy; beat in vanilla. Gradually beat in egg whites. Fold in
flour, then 2 tablespoons melted (cooled) butter. Drop small
teaspoonfuls of mixture onto prepared baking sheets, spacing well
apart; flatten each teaspoonful slightly.  Bake about 8 minutes or
until lightly browned around edges. Using a spatula, immediately
remove cookies from baking sheet to a wire rack; cool.  Melt
chocolate in a small bowl placed over a pan of hot, but not boiling
water.  When cookies are cool, spread each one with a thin layer of
melted chocolate; allow chocolate to set slightly then sprinkle with
coconut.  Place in a cool place until chocolate sets completely.
