Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 6 Serving
MMMMM---------------------------PASTA--------------------------------
1 3/4 c  Flour
2 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
1 pn Salt
2    Extra large eggs
2 ts Vegetable oil
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
4 c  Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese
2 c  Heavy cream
6 tb Sugar
1 tb Orange zest
2 tb Grand Marnier
1 pn Salt
12 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
Chopped
Combine the flour, cocoa, and salt in a bowl and make a well in the
center. Add the eggs and oil in the center of the well and mix with a
fork to form the dough. Knead the dough for 15 minutes until it is
smooth and shiny, adding more flour if necessary to keep the dough
from sticking.

Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for half an hour.  Roll the pasta
out by hand or with a machine and cut into eight 4-1/2 x 11-inch
strips. Cook two strips at a time in boiling salted water.  Cook just
20 seconds after the water returns to a boil.  Plunge the noodles
into cold water to stop the cooking.  When cooled, place on towels in
a single layer to drain.

Combine all filling ingredients and mix until smooth. To assemble:
Preheat oven to 425F with the rack in the upper third of the oven.

Generously butter an 8"x11"x2" pan.  Alternate layers of noodles,
cheese filling, and chocolate, ending with a cheese layer.  Bake for
20-25 minutes until the top is lightly colored.  Let the lasagna
stand for 10 minutes to solidify, then serve warm.
