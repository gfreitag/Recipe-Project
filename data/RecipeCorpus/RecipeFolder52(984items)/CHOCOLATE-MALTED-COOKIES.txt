Title: CHOCOLATE MALTED COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 1/2 dozen
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Butter Flavored Crisco
1 1/4 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 c  Malted milk powder
2 tb Chocolate syrup
1 tb Vanilla extract (yes 1 tb)
1 lg Egg
1 1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
1 c  Milk chocolate chips
Preheat oven to 350-degrees. Get out 2 cookie sheets; no need to
grease them. Mix together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.

In a mixing bowl, combine the shortening, brown sugar, malted milk
powder, chocolate syrup and vanilla. Beat 2 minutes, then add the egg
and beat for a second or two, until mixed.

Gradually add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture, mixing well
between additions. Stir in chocolate morsels and chips. I j used
Guittard's BIG chocolate morsels and their milk chocolate chips. BTW,
these cookies are LOADED with chocolate chips!

Shape dough into 2-inch balls. Place 6 balls of dough onto each cookie
sheet, spacing them 3 inches apart. The cookies are pretty big, not
tiny ones.

Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until golden brown. Mine took 12 minutes.
Don't over-cook them or they'll be hard as a rock.

Cool on cookie sheets for at least 2 minutes or they'll fall apart.
Cool on wire racks.
