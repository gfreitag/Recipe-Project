Title: CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES IV
Categories: Chocolate
Yield: 1 Servings
190 g  Sugar
75 g  Powdered chocolate
125 ml Whipping cream
60 g  Unsalted butter
1.  Put all ingredients in a solid sauce-pan, mix while bringing
slowly to the boil.

2.  Boil gently.

3.  After two minutes you will have a wonderful icing for cakes, and a
sauce for ice cream.

4.  After six minutes (or a little longer if you want your truffles
harder) take sauce-pan off heat and allow the mixture to cool
slightly. At this point you can add dark rum or any other liqueur if
you wish. Cool in the refrigerator for about one hour.

5.  Form into balls about the size of large marbles and roll them in
powdered chocolate. Cool to room temperature, or chill.

Author's Notes: I found this recipe in the flight magazine for a trip
from London to Vienna. I think Vienna is probably the best place in
the world for cakes and sweets. Whatever you do, never go to Vienna
if you are on a diet. This is also the only recipe I have ever
collected that is in cups rather than grams!

Difficulty    : easy. Precision
: measure the ingredients.
