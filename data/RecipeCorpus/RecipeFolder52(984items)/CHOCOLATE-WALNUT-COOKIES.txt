Title: CHOCOLATE WALNUT COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 12 Cookies
4 lg Eggs
1 1/2 c  Sugar
16 oz Semisweet chocolate,
-melted and cooled
1/4 c  Unsalted butter, softened
1 tb Vanilla
1 tb Strong brewed espresso
1/2 c  Cake flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Double-acting baking powder
2 1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
1 c  Walnuts, chopped
In the bowl of an electric mixer beat the eggs and the sugar for 4 to
6 minutes, or until the mixture is thick and pale, add melted
chocolate, the butter, the vanilla, the espresso, the flour, the salt
and the baking powder, and beat the mixture on the lowest setting
until it is combined well.  Add the chocolate chips and the walnuts
and beat the dough until it is combined well. In a sheet of parchment
paper, form the dough into a log, 4 inches in diameter, wrap it in
wax paper, and chill it for 3 hours, or until it is firm.

Cut the log into 1-inch-thick rounds, arrange the rounds 2 inches
apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper, and bake them in
batches in the middle of a preheated 350F oven for 15 minutes, or
until the tops are shiny and cracked slightly.  (The cookies will be
very soft.) Transfer the baking sheets to racks and let the cookies
cool completely before removing them from the sheets. (The cookies
will firm up as they cool.) Makes about 12 cookies.
