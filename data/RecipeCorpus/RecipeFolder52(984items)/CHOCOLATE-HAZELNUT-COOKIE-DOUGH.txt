Title: CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT COOKIE DOUGH
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 42 Cookies
3/4 c  Roasted Oregon hazelnuts
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour; plus...
2 tb All-purpose flour
1 pn Salt
3 tb Unsweetened cocoa
1 c  Unsalted butter
-- room temperature
1/2 c  Sugar
1 lg Egg
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Finely chop hazelnuts with 1/2 cup flour
and salt in food processor. Blend in remaining flour and cocoa. Using
an electric mixer, cream butter with sugar in large bowl until light,
stopping occasionally to scrape down sides. Beat in egg until well
blended. Add flour and nut-cocoa mixture until dough just begins to
come together. Form dough into cylinder about 1-1/2 to 2 inches wide,
10 to 12 inches long, and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until
firm enough to slice, about 30 minutes. Slice into 1/4-inch slices.
Place on ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 4 to 7 minutes or just
until set. Remove from sheet and cool on rack. Dip the ends in melted
semisweet chocolate, or use it to glaze the tops of the cookies for a
fancy finish.
