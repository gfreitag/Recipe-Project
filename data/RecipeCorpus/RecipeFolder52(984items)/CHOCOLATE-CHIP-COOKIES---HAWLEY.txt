175 g  Nestle's chocolate chips (1
Package)

Author's Notes: There is no substitute for chocolate-chip cookies,
warm out of the oven, washed down with cold milk. This is Mom's
recipe, and Mom's Mom's recipe. This is also Nestle's ``TollHouse''
recipe, and the Joy of Cooking ``Chocolate-Chip Drop Cookies''
recipe, etc, which is no coincidence. This is the default recipe.
This is not Mrs. Field's recipe. If youwant Mrs. Field's, use a
shopping mall; if you want simple, elegant, timeless chocolate-chip
cookies, use this recipe.

Important: double all proportions above (always make 2x as much of
these as the recipe calls for). Let's face it: small is beautiful,
but big cookies are better than small ones. All the printed recipes
call for teeny cookies, dropped by teaspoonsful onto cookie sheets
(yield 50). My ``blobs of dough'' are golf-ball sized, which makes
healthy 3-4 inch cookies. I invariably make these on the spur of the
moment, and so usually nuke the butter in a microwave to soften it
up. I also occasionally cheat and soften up the butter/sugar mixture
a tad in the oven. Try adding walnuts, macadamias, white chocolate,
orange peel, butterscotch chips, or mint - all these are welcome
variations. But keep it simple.

Difficulty    : easy to moderate. Precision
: measure the ingredients.
