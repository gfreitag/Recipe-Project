Categories: Chocolate, Breads
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Sugar, brown
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Butter, sweet; chilled

1 1/2 oz Chocolate, bittersweet
Approx. Cook Time: 0:17
Break chocolate into 8 equal pieces. Preheat oven to 375F. In a
large bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and
salt. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes and distribute them over the
flour mixture. With a pastry blender or two knives used scissors
fashion, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
In a small bowl, stir together the peanut butter mixture to the flour
mixture and knead until combined.  Knead in the peanuts. Pat the
dough out into a 1/2-inch thickness on a cutting board. Using a
floured 2-1/2 in. to 3-in. diameter crinkled round biscuit cutter,
cut out rounds from the dough. Gather the scraps together and repeat
until all the dough is used and there are 16 round.  Place 8 of the
rounds on an ungreased baking sheet. Top each round with a piece of
the chocolate and one of the remaining circles of dough. Press the
edges gently to seal. Bake for 17-19 minutes, or until lightly
browned.  Remove the baking sheet to a wire rack and cool 5 minutes.
Using a spatula, transfer the scones to the wire rack to cool. Serve
warm or cool completely and store in an airtight container. VARIATION
(Randy's Preference):  Make the dough as above, omitting bittersweet
chocolate, substituting 1/2 c. unsalted peanuts for the chopped
peanuts and kneading in 3/4 c. semisweet chocolate chips at the same
time. Put the dough into a 9-inch diameter circle on a baking sheet.
With a serrated knife, cut into 8 wedges.  Bake 20-22 minutes, or
until a cake tested or toothpick inserted into the center of a scone
comes out clean. Cool as above and recut into wedges, if necessary.
