Title: CHOCOLATE MOUSSE (2)
Categories: Mousses
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
4 tb Strong coffee
4    Egg yolks
3/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Orange liqueur
1 1/2    Sticks softened unsalted
Butter (not margarine)
4    Egg whites, room temperature
pn Salt
2 tb Sugar
Combine chocolate and coffee in double boiler over almost-simmering
water. Stir till chocolate begins to melt, then go to next step. Beat
egg yolks while gradually adding sugar. Beat 2 or 3 minutes till
mixture is thick, pale, and forms a slowly dissolving ribbon when
beater is

lifted.  Beat in the liqueur.  Set mixing bowl in a pan of
almost-simmering

water.  Beat at moderate speed till warm and foamy. Remove from heat
and beat till cool. Stir chocolate till smooth, gradually beat in
butter. Beat this mixture into the yolk mixture, set aside.

Beat egg whites slowly till they begin to foam, add salt. Increase
speed gradually to fast. Beat till soft peaks are formed. Sprinkle in
sugar and beat till stiff peaks are formed. Stir one fourth of the
egg whites into the chocolate. Scoop the rest on top and *delicately*
fold them in. Immediately turn the mousse into a serving bowl,
lightly oiled metal mold, or individual cups. Cover and chill
overnight. Serve with whipped cream if desired.
