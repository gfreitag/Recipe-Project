NOTE: SELECTING THE RIGHT CHOCOLATE: You'll find three basic types of
chocolate in the baking supplies department of most supermarkets--
semisweet chocolate, unsweetened chocolate, and sweet chocolate. The
semisweet chocolate is made from chocolate that is just slight
sweetened with sugar. Unsweetened chocolate is the original baking or
cooking chocolate and has no added flavorings or sugar. And sweet
chocolate, such as the German cooking chocolate used in the Chocolate
Pots de Creme recipe, is chocolate mixed with sugar and sometimes
additional cocoa butter or flavorings.
