Categories: Alcohol, Beverages
Yield: 1 Pint
2 ts Pure chocolate extract
1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
1 1/2 c  Vodka
1/2 c  Sugar syrup (see recipe)
1/2 ts Fresh mint (optional)
dr Peppermint extract(optional)
Mix all ingredients and let mature 2 weeks. The chocolate tends to
settle on the bottom and may need to be stirred before serving.
Finished version will tend to be thin, but is still quite tasty and
excellent for mixing in coffee or pouring over desserts. Add
glycerine to thicken if desired. For chocolate mint, add 1/2 teaspoon
fresh mint and a few drops of peppermint extract. Let mature 2
additional weeks. Yield: 1 pint Container: Quart jar
