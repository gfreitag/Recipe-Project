Just received a new publication:  THE COOKS BOOKSHELF catalog: "The
Finest Collections of American Cooking"
It is a catalog of "traditional" cookbooks,  many of the community
variety.   (p.o. box 9802-821, Austin, TX 78766). Has lots of neat
cookbooks.  The catalog published the following recipe from the
cookbook "Chockful O' Chips, A Collection of Chocolate Chip Recipes"
by Peggy Seeman.

With the spate of "Mrs. Fields"  and "Niemen Marcus" $250 chocolate
chip cookie recipes, I thought someone might want to try the
following. It does sound good. The author insists that you don't make
substitutions and gives brand names.  Makes it sound authentic,
doesn't it.

Preheat oven to 350.

DO NOT SUBSTITUTE INGREDIENTS (says the author)

Cream together with electric mixer until fluffy the sugars,
shortening, eggs, vanilla and milk.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt and
gradually add to creamed mixture.  Mix well with a spoon. Do not use
electric mixer.

Stir in chocolate chips, oatmeal and pecans.

Drop by teaspoonfuls on lightly greased cooking sheet. Bake for 12-15
minutes.  DO NOT OVERBAKE.  (The key to these cookies turning out
well is mixing the wet ingredients thoroughly until light and fluffy
and in not overbaking)
