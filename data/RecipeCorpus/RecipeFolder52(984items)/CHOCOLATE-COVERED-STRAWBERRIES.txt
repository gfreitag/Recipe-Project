Title: CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRIES
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Fresh strawberries
1 pk Chocolate bark.
Wash and drain strawberries. Pat dry with paper towel. Leave stems
intact. Place half of the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl.
Microwave on high until melted (appx 2 min). Holding berries by the
stem, dip one at a time into the chocolate. Gently shake excess and
place on waxed paper until firm. If chocolate becomes too thick
reheat for a few seconds. Chocolate basket: cover a dish of desired
shape (pie pan) with foil and spray lightly with Pam. Place melted
chocolate in a ziploc bag and seal. Snip a small hole in the corner
and drizzle the chocolate to create a basket. Chill until firm.
Carefully remove the basket. Place on a serving tray and fill with
chocolate covered strawberries.
