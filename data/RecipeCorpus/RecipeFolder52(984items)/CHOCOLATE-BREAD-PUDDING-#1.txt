Categories: Puddings, Desserts, Formatted, Chocolate
Yield: 6 Servings
3 oz Chocolate, unsweetened; cut
-into small pieces
2 c  Half & half
2 c  Bread crumbs, white, soft;
-packed loosely
2    Eggs, jumbo
1 c  Sugar, granulated
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1 pn Salt
1 c  Heavy cream; whipped
HEAT THE CHOCOLATE AND half and half in a large saucepan over low
heat for 12-15 minutes, stirring frequently until chocolate is
completely melted. Remove pan from the heat, stir in the crumbs and
let stand for one hour.
Preheat oven to 350F. Beat the eggs until frothy, blend in the
sugar, vanilla and salt, then mix into the chocolate. Pour the
pudding into a buttered 1 1/2-quart casserole, set it in a shallow
baking pan and pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up
the sides of the casserole. Bake the pudding uncovered for 50 to 60
minutes until the pudding is set like custard.
To test it, insert a toothpick in the center. If it comes out clean,
pudding is done. Serve the pudding warm, topped with dollops of
whipped cream.
