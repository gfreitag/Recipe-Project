Yield: 24 Servings
1 c  Sifted flour
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Non-fat dry milk powder
1/2 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Sifted cocoa
1    Egg; lightly beaten
1/2 c  Melted butter
1/4 c  Water
1 ts Vanilla
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Mix flour, sugar, powdered milk, baking powder,
salt and cocoa together and sift well. Beat in remainder of
ingredients, adding a little more water if needed to make a smooth
dough. Drop from a teaspoon onto a well-greased baking sheet, spacing

browned around the edges. Let cool 1-to-2 minutes on sheets, then
lift to wire racks to cool.
