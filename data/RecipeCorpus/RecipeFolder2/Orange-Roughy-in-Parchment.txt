2 tb Capers
2 tb Parsley; Chopped
1 ea Carrot; Julienned

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. (220 degrees C.).  Cook the carrots in
1/2 cup of water for 5 minutes.  Drain and set aside.  Cut the parchment
or foil into 2 large pieces, big enough to wrap each fillet in.  Place one
half of the carrots and peapods in the center of the foil.  Place a fillet
on top of the vegetables.  Pour one half of the lime juice over the fillet
and sprinkle with paprika.  Scatter some of the sliced olives and capers
over the top of the fillet.  Sprinkle some of the chopped parsley on top
of the capers.  Fold the edges of the parchment or foil to completely
enclose the fillet and seal them.  Place on a baking sheet and bake 8 to
10 minutes.  To serve, place the packet on a serving dish, and cut a slash
in the top.  Open slightly to let the steam escape and serve.
