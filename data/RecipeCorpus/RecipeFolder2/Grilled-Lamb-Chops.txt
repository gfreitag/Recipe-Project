Title: Grilled Lamb Chops
Categories: Lamb
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Poupon mustard
1 c  White wine
1/2 c  Shallots (minced)
1 c  Red current jelly
1 ea Rack of lamb
1/2 c  Butter
2 tb Rosemary (crushed)
Mix jelly and mustard in saucepan and simmer on stovetop for 5 minutes to
melt jelly. Remove lamb chops from rach and French cut, being careful not
to remove the fat from the eye (the fat will protect the meat from burning
on the grill). Allow sauce to cool completely. Submerge lamb chops in sauce
and allow to marinade overnight (place in refrigerator). Grill over Hickory
coals 4 to 5 minutes (for medium to medium-rare), basting with sauce as it
cooks. Turn once half-way through cooking time. Prepare garnish sauce by
browning shallots in butter and stirring in the white wine and rosemary.
Serve lamb with garnish sauce and grilled potatoes and vegtables. NOTE: The
marinade sauce also goes well with other foods including mushrooms.
