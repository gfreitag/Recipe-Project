Title: Pasta Primavera
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  35% cream
1/2 c  Tomato sauce
1 ea Enough fettuccine for 4
2 tb Cream
1/2 c  Salted butter
2 ts Fresh black pepper
2/3 c  (tl)carrots, zucchini, broc.
2 ea Egg yolks
Melt the butter in a large sauce pan.  Add the cream and the pepper. Bring
to a simmer. Add the tomato sauce and the precooked vegetables. Stir in the
cooked pasta.  Remember to cook it al dente still slightly firm to the
bite. Whip the egg yolks with a fork and mix them into the cream. Whisk the
mixture into the cream sauce and pasta.  This will serve as a thickner.
Make sure the pasta is completely coated with the sauce and serve with some
parmesan cheese.
