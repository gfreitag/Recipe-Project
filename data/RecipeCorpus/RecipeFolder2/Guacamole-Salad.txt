Title: Guacamole Salad
Categories: Mexican, Salads, Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
1 ea Medium garlic clove, minced
4 oz Can chopped green chili
1 ts Salt
5 ea Large avocados
1 ea Medium tomato, chopped
2 1/2 tb Lemon or lime juice
Peel and chop avocados into a bowl. Mash with garlic and lemon juice. Add
remaining ingredients, mixture will be chunky. To prepare individual
salads, spoon mixture on shredded or whole lettuce leaves. Top with diced
tomato for garnish and serve with tortilla chips. If made ahead of time,
save pit and put in dip until time to serve to prevent darkening. NOTE:
This is my own recipe and the chili can be adjusted to taste. Also, I
sometimes replace the tomato and green chili with salsa.
