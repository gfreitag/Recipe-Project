Dry veal on paper towels.  Roll in a mixture of salt, sugar, white pepper,
and mustard.  Place a bacon slice on top of each piece of veal. Place an
unsliced egg on top of the bacon.  Rollup each slice of veal (jelly-roll
fashion) and tie together with string.  Heat oil in frypan and brown veal
rolls well on all sides.  Add onion; saute for 3 minutes. Add the hot
bouillon; cover and simmer gently 25 minutes. Remove the veal from the pan.
Remove the strings from the veal and keep veal warm on a serving platter.
Add tomato paste to the pan drippings; stir. Thoroughly mix flour and red
wine to remove all lumps. Add to sauce and cook until mixture thickens. Add
warm veal rolls and heat through. Before serving, place veal rolls on a
platter, pour sauce over the rolls and serve with pureed potatoes.
