Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside. Combine sugar,
eggs, and oil in a mixing bowl.  Beat with an electric mixer set at medium
speed for 2 minutes.  Beat in the beets, cooled chocolate, and vanilla.
Gradually add dry ingredients, beating well after each addition. Pour into
greased 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven
for 25 minutes or until cake tests done. Cool in pan on rack. Cover and let
stand overnight to improve flavor. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
NOTE: This is similar to a recipe that I had from one of the local cooking
shows that was sent out to the listeners when the Red food coloring was
banned. While I have not tried this recipe, I did make the other one and it
was good.  But the other recipe is long gone.
