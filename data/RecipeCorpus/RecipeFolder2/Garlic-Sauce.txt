Title: Garlic Sauce
Categories: Sauces, Appetizers, Garlic
Yield: 1 servings
10 ea Slices white bread
1/2 c  White vinegar
3 tb Water
1 ea Large head of garlic
1 c  Olive oil
1 tb Lemon juice
Peel and crush the garlic, the entire head.  Remove the crusts from the
white bread, and place the crustless bread in a mixing bowl.  Add the
garlic along with the olive oil and vinegar. Let this soften for 1 hour.
Beat with an electric mixer until all is smooth. Don't do this with a food
processor as it will be too smooth.  Add lemon juice, slowly add water
while the mixer is running so you will have a thick and fluffy sauce.
