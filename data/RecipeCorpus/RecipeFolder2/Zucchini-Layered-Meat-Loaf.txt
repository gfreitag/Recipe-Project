~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prepare the basic meat loaf -- except spread 1/3 of the mixture evenly in
an ungreased loaf pan, 9 X 5 X 3-inches.  Sprinkle half each of the cheese,
zucchini and pimento in layers, spreading the layers to within 1/2 inch of
all sides of the pan.  Repeat the layers ending up with a layer of the meat
mixture on the top.  Be sure to cover the layers completely by spreading
the mixture to the sides of the pan.  Omit the catsup and bake, uncovered,
for 1 1/4 hours. Drain off the excess fat and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes
before slicing into thick slices.  Serve on a heated platter.
