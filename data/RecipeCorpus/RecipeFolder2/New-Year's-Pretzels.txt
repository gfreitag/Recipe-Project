until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.  Punch dough down and let rise again
until doubled. (1 hour more).  Divide dough in half. Shape pretzel as
follows:  Roll dough into a rope about 30 inches long and 1 1/2 inches in
diameter.  Cross the ends leaving a large loop in the center. Flip loop
back onto crossed ends to form a pretzel. Repeat with remaining dough.
Place pretzels on greased baking sheets. Let rise 15 minutes more. Bake at
375 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire
racks.  Mix confectioners' sugar, water and vanilla to form a thin icing.
Spread icing on pretzels and sprinkle with chopped almonds. Makes 2 large
pretzels.
