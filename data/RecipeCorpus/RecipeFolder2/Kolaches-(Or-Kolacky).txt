These are very simple, but you will find NO better cookie anywhere! On
the down side, they do require advanced preparation (overnight is best).
Included are a couple of filling recipes, but a can of pre-made will work
too. (Apricot is best)   When rolling out dough, try to keep it as chilled
as possible. To cream the cottage cheese, it helps if you have a food
processor or blender, but a fork and a strong arm will do in a pinch. Mix
ingredients and chill at least 6 hours. Roll to 1/4" thickness. Cut into 2
or 3 inch squares, and place filling or preserves in center of square.
Bring corners over filling and seal together. Bake at 350 - 25 to 30
minutes. Remove and dust with powdered sugar. Pineapple Filling: Combine
ingredients in sauce pan, cook stirring constantly until thickened. Cool.
Apricot Filling: Simmer apricot 10 minutes. Add sugar and simmer 10 minutes
more. Remove from heat and add butter and cinnamon. Cool.
