NOTE:  Prebaked crusts are much crisper than the chilled ones and this can
be important if you want a crisp crust. CRUST: If you are prebaking the
shell, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Place the crumbs in a mixing
bowl and add the butter and sugar blending well. Press the crumb mixture
into the bottom and up the sides of an 8-inch springform pan. Smooth the
mixture to form an even layer on the bottom and sides. Bake the crust in
the oven for 10 minutes and let cool to room temperature before filling.
NOTE:  This crust can be chilled for 5 to 10 minutes in the freezer until
it is set but is not recommended in this recipe. CHEESECAKE: Preheat the
oven to 300 degrees F.  In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and
sugar until light and fluffy.  Add the egg yolks, one at a time, beating
well after each.  Beat in the flour, lemon rind, lemon juice, and vanilla
until just mixed.  Whip the cream until stiff in a medium mixing bowl. Set
aside.  In another mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until they form stiff
peaks, then fold them into the cheese mixture. Fold in the reserved whipped
cream.  Stir in the passion fruit pulp then pour the mixture into the
prepared crust and bake fro 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool, in the oven, to
room temperature, then chill.
