Title: Fettuccine with Cream, Basil and Romano
Categories: Pasta, Ethnic
Yield: 4 servings
4 ea Green onions; chopped
1/2 c  Parmesan; freshly grated
1/2 c  Romano; freshly grated
1/2 lb Fettuccine
1 x  Parmesan; freshly grated
4 ea Bacon slices; chopped thick
1/2 c  Whipping cream
1 x  Or:
1/3 c  Basil; chopped fresh
1 x  Salt and freshly ground pepp
1 x  Romano; freshly grated
Cook bacon in heavy medium skillet over medium heat until beginning to
brown. Add green onions and stir until softened, about 1 minute. Add cream
and simmer until beginning to thicken, about 1 minute.  Mix in 1/2 cup
Romano cheese and chopped fresh basil. Meanwhile, cook fettuccine in large
pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite,
stirring occasionally. Drain well.  Return to hot pot. Add sauce and stir
to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, passing additional
cheese separately. *** My notes:  When I made this, I used 1 cup whipping
cream, 1/2 cup each Parmesan and Romano, 1 tbsp dried basil, and
substituted 4 or 5 thin slices of Prosciutto for the bacon- frying slightly
in butter. I used about 6 ounces of "Pesto Linguini", which is a thinner
pasta containing basil. We like LOTS of sauce! Source: Stephanie Dicamillo-
