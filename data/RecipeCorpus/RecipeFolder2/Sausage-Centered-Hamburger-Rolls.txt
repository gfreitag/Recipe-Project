Mix the meat, apple, onion, egg and seasonings together.  Divide the
mixture into 10 equal parts.  Mold each part around a sausage link, sealing
the ends.  Brown the meat rolls in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove
the meat rolls.  Pour all but 2 Tbls of the fat from the skillet. Stir the
flour into the remaining fat.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly,
until the mixture is thick and bubbly.  Stir in the bouillon and water.
Heat to boiling, stirring constantly and then reduce the heat. Return the
meat rolls to the skillet; cover and simmer for about 15 minutes. NOTE:
Buttered noodles are a good "go-with" for this zesty dish.
