excess fat.  Stir in the salt, pepper, 2 Tb of the baking mix, and the
worcestershire sauce.  Turn the meat filling into the pastry lined pie pan.
Arrange the tomato slices on the meat mixture.  Beat the eggs slightly and
stir in the cheese.  Spoon onto the tomatoes spreading the mixture to cover
the top completely.  Bake for about 30 minutes.  Cut into wedges and serve
with chili sauce, if desired.
