Title: Unusual Chinese Grilled Shortribs
Categories: Meats, Chinese
Yield: 4 servings
1/3 c  Oriental toasted sesame oil
4 tb Brown sugar
3/4 c  Soy sauce
1/2 c  Rice sherry wine
2 ea Large garlic cloves (minced)
4 ea Large, meaty shortribs
4 1/2 tb Peanut butter
2 1/4 tb Curry powder
1/2 tb Black pepper (fresh cracked)
1/2 ea Fresh ginger root
10 ea Green onions
Make shortribs into short, flat strips.  Begin by placing rib fat-side-up
on cutting board and cut 1/4" high layer almost (but not through) the
bottom-most section of the rib.  Turn meat over and continue to make 1/4"
layers until the rib is completely layered and is now one long strip. Using
the edge of a Chinese knife or otehr flat surface, pound meat until it is
off an even thickness. NOTE:  Chill the meat well. This cutting method will
not work well on room temperature ribs. MARINADE: (Curry Based Blender
Sauce) Blend all liquid ingredients in a blender for about 15 seconds at
"Blend" speed. Grate the fresh ginger root and combine with the minced
garlic. Mince the white (only) portion of the green onions. Add all
ingredients to blender mixture and operate on "low" for about 45 seconds.
Rub suace onto butterflied ribs and refridgerate for 2 or more hours. NOTE:
This sauce is excellent for chicken, too. Place ribs on grill, basting
often with sauce until done, about 30 minutes depending on heat of grill.
Watch carefully to determine when done.
