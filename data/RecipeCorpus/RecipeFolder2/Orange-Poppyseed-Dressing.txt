Title: Orange Poppyseed Dressing
Categories: Salads, Dressings
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 c  Lime juice
2 tb Orange rind; grated
2 tb Onion; minced
1 x  Salt & pepper to taste
2/3 c  Safflower or corn oil
2 tb Orange juice
2 tb Honey
1 tb Poppy seeds
** I used peanut oil and minced green onions when I made this.  I served it
on a salad of Boston lettuce with melon and chopped prosciutto. Slightly
toast the poppy seeds (method below).  Place all ingredients in a screw-top
jar. Shake vigorously.  Chill until serving. This dressing complements any
green salad, but the addition of some small chunks of cantelope, honeydew,
or star fruit to your greens will enhance the orange-honey flavor of the
dressing.  Or try it over slices of cold roast pork with nectarine wedges
on watercress. Poppy Seeds: Did you know that it takes almost a million
seeds to make a pound? These tiny bluish-black gems come from the opium
poppy plant. But even if you eat a million, you won't experience any
narcotic effect. Connoisseurs say those imported from Holland taste best.
For even better flavor, seeds should be slightly toasted in a 350 degree
oven for about 5 minutes.
