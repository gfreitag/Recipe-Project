Title: Classic Mexican Flan
Categories: Mexican, Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
3    Egg yolk
1/2 ts Almond extract
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Sugar
1 cn Sweetened condensed milk;
1 c  Milk
3    Eggs
In a small saucepan melt sugar over moderate heat, stirring frequently,
until sugar is a dark, caramel-colored liquid. Remove from heat and pour
into a 4 cup metal ring mold or 8 individual molds. Quickly turn mold to
coat bottom and sides with the caramel. Let cool so caramel hardens. Heat
oven to 325. Put the condensed milk, milk, eggs, egg yolks and flavorings
into an electric blender. Cover and blend to mix well. Pour mixture into
mold; put mold in a larger pan filled with water to depth of 1/2 inch. Bake
for 1 hour. Remove from oven and remove mold from water. Cool and then
refrigerate up to 2 days. Cover mold with an inverted serving platter. Hold
mold and platter together and turn them over. Lift off mold. Caramel will
fall as a liquid sauce over the custard. Source: CRS file
