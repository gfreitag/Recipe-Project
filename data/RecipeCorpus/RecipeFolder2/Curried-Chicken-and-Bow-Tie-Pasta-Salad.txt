Poach chicken by placing in a large pot with enough cold water to barely
cover.  Add peppercorns, bay leaf, parsley, thyme and one each: onion,
carrot and celery cut into quarters.  Bring to a bare boil with lid on;
reduce heat to low and simmer for 50 minutes.  Cool in poaching liquid,
then drain, skin and shred. To make curry flavouring, soften diced onion in
hot oil, then add curry powder and cook over medium-high heat for a further
3 minutes.  Add wine and water.  Boil rapidly until reduced to about 3
tablespoons.  Strain and let cool. Prepare curry mayonnaise by combining
all ingredients until smooth. Place peppers in a large bowl (reserving a
little for garnish), with chicken, pasta, salt, pepper and curry
mayonnaise.  Mix gently until well- coated. If mayonnaise mixture is too
thick, add warm water gradually until a smooth consistency is attained.
Place a portion of salad on bed of spinach and sprinkle reserved peppers on
top. Assemble just before serving, as the mayonnaise quickly loses its
fresh look.
