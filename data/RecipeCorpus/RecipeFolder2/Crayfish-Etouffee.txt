cornstarch in water; add wine to mixture. Cook for 20 minutes or until
sauce thickens. Add crayfish, green onion and Kitchen Bouquet. Refrigerate
overnight. Reheat and serve over rice. Don't overcook. Boiling crayfish:
Discard any dead crayfish in the sack. Wash crayfish in clean, cool water
just before cooking. They do not need to be purged with salt during
washing.   Place the live crayfish in boiling water and boil for 10
minutes. (Season the water with one pound of salt per five gallons of
water. Add other seasoning to taste, including cayenne, garlic, onions,
lemons, lemon juice and crab boil.) Don't begin timing cooking until watter
returns to a buil after adding crayfish. It's usual to add potatoes and
corn on the cob to the boil. Crayfish are easiest to peel when still warm.
