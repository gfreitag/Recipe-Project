I concocted this recipe while trying to duplicate a potato salad served at
a local restaurant.  (See recipe for New Potato Salad). Beat together all
ingredients and season well with salt and pepper. More mustard and some
lemon juice can be added to suit individual taste. Milk or cream can be
added for a thinner dressing.  Chill an hour or more before serving. YIELD:
