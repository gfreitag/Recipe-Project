1/3 c  Olive oil

1. Sprinkle the eggplant slice with 1 tsp salt and set aside for 1

2. In a separate bowl, combine the oil, garlic and thyme to make the
seasoned oil.

3. Preheat the oven to 350F.

4. Place a large cast-iron skillet over high heat for 3 minutes.
While the skillet is heating, brush the eggplant slices with the
seasoned oil. Saut the eggplant over high heat until it is crusty
and dark, 2-3 minutes each side. Saut as many slices as comfortably
fit in the pan, then repeat the process. Do not crowd the skillet.
Turn the heat down if the eggplant is browning too quickly.

tomato, and onion slices, leaving «-inch of each uncovered. Repeat the
layers until all the vegetable slices have been used.

6. Add the remaining 1 tsp salt and the pepper to the remaining
seasoned oil and brush the vegetables with this mixture. Place the
thyme and basil in between the layered vegetables. Bake uncovered for
1 hour. Serve hot or at room temperature.

Can be refrigerated for 1 day. REheat before serving.
