Eggplant dip is popular in many Mediterranean countries. In the West
it is often called poor man's caviar. It's good with raw vegetable
dippers or on crisp Melba toast.

Prick whole eggplant in several places with a fork. Place in a baking
pan and bake in 400 F oven for 30 minutes. Cool, peel and chop
finely. (A blender or food processor can be used but avoid
overprocessing. Dip is best when it has some crunch.)

Combine eggplant, onions, tomato, garlic and celery. Add lemon juice,
vegetable oil, salt and freshly ground pepper. Cover tightly and
refrigerate for several hours to blend flavors.
