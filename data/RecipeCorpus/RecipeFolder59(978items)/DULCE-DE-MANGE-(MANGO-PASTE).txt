Dulces (literally sweets) like this one are common all over Latin
America. They are firm, sliceable pastes made from, for example,
quinces or sweet potatoes. Serving a slice of semi-soft cheese with a
similarly- sized slice of dulce is a popular dessert and the flavours
marry exceptionally well. This mango dulce originated in the
Caribbean.

Peel remove the flesh and process enough ripe mangoes to provide 2
cups of mango puree.

Scrape the puree into a saucepan and add 2 cups of white sugar and a
tablespoon of lime juice.

Cook over a medium heat, stirring all the time until the mixture
thickens sufficiently so that you can see the bottom of the saucepan
in the wake of the spoon.

Moisten the inside of a mould++a cake or loaf tin will do++scrape the
dulce into it and leave to cool.  When it is cold, turn out. It will
keep very well wrapped in plastic and refrigerated.
