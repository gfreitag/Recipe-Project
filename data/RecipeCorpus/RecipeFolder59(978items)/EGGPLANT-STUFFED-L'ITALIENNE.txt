Title: EGGPLANT STUFFED L'ITALIENNE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
8 tb Olive oil
4    Tomatoes, peeled, seeded and
1 1/2 c  Bread crumbs, home made or p
1 cn 7oz  tuna fish, canned;-opt
6    Anchovy filets, finely chopp
2 tb Capers, minced
Parsley and basil (optional)
1/2 c  Olives, finely minced
5    Eggplants, very small or l l
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 2. Cut the eggplants in half
lengthwise, if using the small ones and take out the flesh, being
careful not to damage the skin.  Mince the pulp well and place in
colander after sprinkling with coarse(sea or kosher) salt for 30
minutes. Do the same with the eggplant shells and put them on a paper
towel to drain. 3. Heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a large
skillet. Add the well drained eggplant pulp and cook until lightly
browned. 3. Add the tomatoes and cook the mixture over high heat
until the liquid is evaporated. 4. Add the other ingredients (Note:I
do not use the tuna fish or the olives if I'm making this as a side
dish;but they would be necessary if this is to be a main dish
entree.) Cook the mixture for 2 more minutes. Season with care as the
anchovies and capers are quite strongly flavored. 5. Fill the
eggplant halves with the mixture.  there will probably be leftover
ingredients to be placed in another (covered) baking dish. Drizzle
the leftover olive oil on top and bake for 1 hour.
