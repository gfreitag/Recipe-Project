Title: EAST AFRICAN PIRI-PIRI SAUCE *** (VXSJ69A)
Categories: Appetizers, Sauces, Dips
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Unsalted butter
3 ea Small red chiles
6 ea Cloves garlic
1 tb Paprika
1/2 ts Chile powder
1 x  Lemon or lime juice
Since I can't add to the note, I'll add A note. You like hot? You can
increase the heat to "paint-remover" by using hotter chiles or adding
to spice quantities. Pound chiles and garlic in a mortar (or
process). Add to melted butter (in Africa, usually clarified butler)
with paprika and chile powder. Add lime or lemon juice to taste (lime
will be better for this one). Mix well. For chicken wings, or
breasts, or fish, or prawns, marinate meat for 5 - 10 minutes, baste
with sauce while cooking and spoon sauce over before serving.
