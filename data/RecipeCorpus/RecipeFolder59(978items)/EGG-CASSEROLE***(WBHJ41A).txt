Title: EGG CASSEROLE***(WBHJ41A)
Categories: Brunch, Casserole, Dairy
Yield: 6 Servings
12 ea Eggs
1 lb Sausage
1 cn Cream Style Corn
I was hoping someone would ask. This recipe came from an enclave of
Order of the Arrow Scouts here in Tenn. Crumble and brown the
sausage. Add cream style corn. Add the dozen eggs. Stir this into
bottom of the dutch oven. On a 12 inch oven place about 8 briquets on
the bottom and 14 on top. Cook about 30 minutes. This is great for
camping trips. You can bake your biscuits while the eggs are cooking
and have it all come out together. Let's have a recipe from you now,
Arlene. ...Bill in Tennessee FROM: BILL ARNOLD   (WBHJ41A)
