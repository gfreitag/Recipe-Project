Title: EASY POACHED FISH
Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
1 qt Water
1/2 md Onion; sliced
6    Whole black peppercorns
3    Whole allspice
3 tb Lemon juice
1    Bay leaf
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Dry white wine
Combine all ingredients in large skillet or Dutch oven. It may be
necessary to double or triple recipe if larger amount of liquid is
needed to be sure fish is just covered during poaching. Simmer for
20-30 minutes to blend flavors.  Add fish; cover and simmer over low
heat for 15-25 minutes, or until fish flakes easily when tested with
a fork. (NOTE: Avoid using high heat.  Boiling action will break up
fish.)  Lift cooked fish carefully from liquid with wide spatula.
Drain well, patting excess moisture from fish with paper towels if
necessary. Poached fish may be served hot or cold with a
complementary sauce or flaked/chunked and used in casseroles,
spreads, etc.
