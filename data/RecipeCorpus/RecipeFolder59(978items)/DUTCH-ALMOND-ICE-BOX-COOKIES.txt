Title: DUTCH ALMOND ICE BOX COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Sugar
1 lb Softened margarine
1/2 lb (2-cup) almond paste, grated
-or broken up into very
-small pieces
4 c  Unsifted flour
1 ts Almond flavoring
Granulated sugar for dusting

Cream the sugar and margarine. Add the almond paste and work in
either by hand or on the low speed of an electric mixer. Knead in the
flour, add the flour a little at a time, first with the beater, then
by hand. Form the dough into 3 or 4 balls, wrap in waxed paper and
chill overnight in the refrigerator. Slice 1/4 inch thick. Rolls can
be frozen, and thawed. Bake cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet in
preheated oven to 350 degrees for 10-12 minutes. Watch carefully
because they burn easily. Cookies should be crisp and dry, and only a
little brown at the edges. Cool cookies and place in pie plate with a
little sugar; shake to cover the bottoms of cookies.
