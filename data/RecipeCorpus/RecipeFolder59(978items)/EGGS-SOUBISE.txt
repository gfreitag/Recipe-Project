This recipe for soubise sauce comes from a French chef who bases it
on a classic method. The addition of rice to the sauce gives it bulk
and a satisfying baseline, perfect for lightly poached eggs. Served
with triangles of fried bread this dish makes an excellent supper.

To make the soubise sauce, start by cooking the rice for 5 minutes in
salted boiling water. Drain. Heat the stock to boiling-point, and put
in the onions and the rice. Simmer for 30 minutes until well reduced,
stirring from time to time. Add the butter or margarine, purÂ‚e in the
blender, reheat, then thin out with a little cream or yogurt. Check
the seasoning and serve hot.

Place each poached egg in a warm ramekin dish and spoon some soubise
sauce over them. Surround with crisp, golden triangles of fried bread
and serve immediately.
