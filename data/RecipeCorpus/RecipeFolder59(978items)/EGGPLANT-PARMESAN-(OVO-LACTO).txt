Title: EGGPLANT PARMESAN (OVO LACTO)
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Eggplant
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
3    Egg whites or 1/2 cup egg
Substitute
1/4 c  Skim milk
2 c  Bread crumbs
1 ts Salt (in all)
1 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
1/4 ts White pepper
2 c  Tomato sauce
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
1 c  Mozzarella cheese
(optional)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Slice eggplant into 1/4" thick rounds.
Prepare three bowls, the first with the flour mixed with 1/2 tsp
salt, the second with the egg whites mixed with the skim milk, and
the third with bread crumbs mixed with remaining 1/2 tsp salt,
oregano, and pepper. Dredge eggplant slices in flour, then egg and
milk mixture, and then bread crumb mixture.  Make a layer of coated
slices in a casserole dish and sprinkle with 1 cup tomato sauce and
1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Make another layer of slices on the first
layer, staggering slices so they don't completely overlap lower
slices.  Sprinkle second layer with remaining 1 cup tomato sauce and
1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Cover casserole and bake for 45 minutes.
Optional: remove casserole and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and
return to oven for 5 minutes until cheese is melted.
