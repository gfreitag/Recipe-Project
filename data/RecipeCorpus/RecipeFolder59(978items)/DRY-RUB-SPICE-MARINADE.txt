Title: DRY RUB SPICE MARINADE
Categories: Herb/spice, Marinades
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Kosher salt
2 tb Garlic powder
1 tb Dried thyme
2 ts Ground black pepper
1/4 c  Granulated or brown sugar
2 tb Paprika
2 ts Cayenne pepper
Combine all ingredients, blending thoroughly. If reserving for later
use, store in a tightly capped jar. To use, sprinkle heavily over all
sides of meat and rub in well with fingers. Let meat stand at room
temperature for two hours, or lightly covered overnight in the
refrigerator. Sprinkle meat again lightly before grilling, broiling
or baking. This recipe makes enough for 3-4 pounds spareribs. Mixture
is also good on poultry.

Keeps indefinitely in tightly capped jar. Note from the cook:"The
secret of a good dry rub is equal proportions of kosher salt and
sugar. The salt draws juices to the surface of the meat; the sugar
drinks those juices up, making a lovely, light, potently seasoned
glaze on the meat.These are the herb bottles closest to my hands, if
you have other stuff handy, add it as you wish: ground ginger, or dry
mustard; red pepper flakes, or onion powder. Customize it any way you
will." Via: RFIX_S 09-28-1994
