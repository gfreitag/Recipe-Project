Title: EASTER NESTS
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Coconut;shredded
1 lb White chocolate;OR
1 lb Green coating
1 lb Small Jelly Beans
Melt your coating mix. If you have white chocolate just add a drop or
two of green coloring(do not use the liquid kind) so that it is a
light green. I Melt mine in a stainless steel bowl in a pan of water,
I use my old large electric fry pan if I am melting a lot of
different colors. You can also melt them in wide mouth jars, and keep
what you don't use. In bowl of melted coating mis in the coconut.
Spoon out on was paper, put a indentation in middle to look like a
nest, and add the small jelly beans. I also put in the freezer for a
few minutes to set real good. Enjoy Joni in S.Jersey ~--
