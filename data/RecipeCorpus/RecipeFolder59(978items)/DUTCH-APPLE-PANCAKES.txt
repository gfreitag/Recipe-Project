Title: DUTCH APPLE PANCAKES
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 4 Servings
1 md Sized apples, peeled,
Cored, and sliced thinly
1/4 c  Butter
2 tb Sugar (or more, to taste)
1/2 ts Cinnamon
Note: i also add some
Freshly grated nutmeg (1/4
To 1/2 a tsp) to the
Mix there's nothing like
Fresh nutmeg!
1 c  Biscuit mix
2/3 c  Milk
1    Egg
1 tb Sugar
More fresh nutmeg, to taste
Core apple and thinly slice. Melt butter in hot skillet. Blend in
sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add apples and saute until tender.
Meanwhile, combine biscuit mix, milk, egg, sugar, and more nutmeg
until just moistened. Pour over apples, turn heat to low and cook 10
to 12 minutes or until surface of pancake looks dull. Place under
broiler 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned. To serve, invert
pancake onto a serving platter and pass extra butter (or syrup if you
like). Theoretically, this serves four, but it only serves two for
Saturday morning brunch at our house! R. Miles
