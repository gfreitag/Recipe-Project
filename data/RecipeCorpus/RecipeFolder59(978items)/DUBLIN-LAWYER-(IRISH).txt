Title: DUBLIN LAWYER (IRISH)
Categories: Fish, Irish
Yield: 2 Servings
1 x  Fresh lobster/about 2 1/2 lb
3 tb Butter
4 tb Irish whiskey
150 ml Cream
1 x  Salt and pepper
The lobster should be cut in two down the center. Remove all the meat
from the lobster, including the claws: retain the shell for serving.
Cut the meat into chunks. Heat the butter until foaming and quickly
saute the lobster chunks in it, until just cooked but not colored.
Warm the whiskey slightly, then pour it over the lobster and set fire
to it. Add the cream, mix with the pan juices, and taste for
seasoning. Put back into the half shells and serve hot.
