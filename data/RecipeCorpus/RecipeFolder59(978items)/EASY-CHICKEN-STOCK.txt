Title: EASY CHICKEN STOCK
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 16 Servings
5 lb Chicken parts (see notes)
16 c  Water
2 md Onions -- peeled and
Quartered
2    Carrots -- chopped
2    Celery stalks -- chopped
8    Peppercorns
6    Sprigs parsley
2    Bay leaves
Several sprigs fresh thyme
1/2 ts Dried thyme
2    Whole cloves
1. Place chicken parts in a large pot, cover with the water and bring
to a gentle boil; skim foam as it rises.

2. Reduce heat, add remaining ingredients, and simmer 3 to 4 hours.
Skim foam occasionally.

3. Strain stock through a cheesecloth-lined colander or wire-mesh
sieve. Cool to room temperature. To use broth immediately, blot up
liquid fat from surface by touching the globules lightly with a paper
towel. If you're not using it the same day, refrigerate; spoon off
the fat when it solidifies on the surface.

4. Store in refrigerator for several days, or freeze up to 8 months.

Makes 16 cups.
