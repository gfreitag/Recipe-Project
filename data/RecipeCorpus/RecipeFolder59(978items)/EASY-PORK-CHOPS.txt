Title: EASY PORK CHOPS
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg Onion chopped
1 tb Butter
4    Chops (thin, thick, bone in
-or out - whatever you have)
1/2    Can cream of mushroom
1 c  Sour cream
Freshly ground pepper
Saute the onion in the butter until transparent.  Add chops to
skillet and brown on one side.  After turning, add the mixture of
soup and sour cream. Trun down heat and cover. Cook 20 minutes, more
or less depending on thickness of chops.  Top with lots of freshly
ground pepper.

The sauce makes a kind of gravy which I serve over egg noodles or
mashed potatoes.
