Title: DURUM-WHEAT PASTA FOR PASTA MACHINE
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 1 Lb
3 c  Finely ground Semolina flour
3/4 c  Water
Following the instructions given in your owner's manual, prepare and
set up the pasta machine with an extruder die to make the desired
shape of pasta.

All ingredients must be at room temperature. Add the dry ingredients
to the pasta machine mixing bowl. Switch the pasta machine on. Slowly
pour the liquid ingredients through the feed tube. Mix for
approximately 3 minutes, or until the dough appears to be coming
together in soft, pea-sized crumbs.

Following the instructions given in your owner's manual, begin to
extrude the dough. Cut off the first 2 to 3 inches extruded and
discard. As the pasta begins to come out, gently move it away from
the maching. Cut with a sharp paring knife or scissors at desired
lengths. Place extruded pasta on a wire rack or on a clean kitchen
cloth. Let sit for at least 30 minutes before cooking, or store for
later use.  Makes four 4 oz servings.
