refrigerate or freeze (see Timesaver Tip).

5. To serve: Cook 12 ounces dried spaghetti, following package
directions. Drain. Serve sauce over pasta. Serve with a generous
amount of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

* Timesaver Tip: Sauce can be made up to 2 days ahead, covered, and
refrigerated, or it can be frozen. To freeze, spoon into freezer
container, cover, label, and freeze at 0 degrees F up to 4 months. To
serve, defrost sauce 20 to 30 minutes in microwave oven on Defrost
setting, stirring several times, or thaw in refrigerator 8 to 24
hours. Gently warm sauce in saucepan or in microwave oven on 50%
power, 3 to 5 minutes, stirring several times.
