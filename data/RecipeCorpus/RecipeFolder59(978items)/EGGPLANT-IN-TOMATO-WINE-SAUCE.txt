Title: EGGPLANT IN TOMATO-WINE SAUCE
Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 1 Servings
2    + cups dry pasta shells (I
Used small shells)
1/3    Water
1/4 c  Vinger (favorite flavor, I
Used white)
1 lg Eggplant, peeled and cubed
1 sm Red onion, chopped
1/2    To  1 cup mushrooms,
Chopped
1    Green pepper, chopped
1/2 c  Chopped chives
2 tb Finely chopped/minced
Garlic
1 md Tomatoe, chopped
10 oz Tomatoe sauce
4 tb Oregono (adjust, start w/3
Also try italian herbs)
1/8    To 1/2 tsp salt (taste)
1 ea Ground pepper (fresh best)
1/4 c  Red wine
Cook pasta shells.  While cooking pasta heat a large skillet with the
water and vinegar. When getting hot add the cubed eggplant, onion,
chives, garlic, green peppers, and mushrooms. Saute till soft (I
sauted at fairly high heat for about 15-20 minutes stirring a lot. I
like eggplant to be prettty).  When done add to the pasta along with
the tomato sauce, oregano, salt, pepper and red wine. stir and heat
gently (on low). This was actually fairly easy to make, the only time
consuimg paret was peeling the eggplant and chopping veges.
