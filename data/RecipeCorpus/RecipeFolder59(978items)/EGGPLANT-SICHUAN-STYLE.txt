CUT EGGPLANT into 1/2-by-2-inch strips. If using Italian eggplants,
peel skin. In a colander, toss eggplant with salt; drain for 30
minutes. Squeeze gently to remove excess water. Pat dry with paper
towels. In a small bowl, mix soy sauce, sugar and chicken stock.
Preheat wok until hot over high heat. Add 3 tablespoons of the oil,
tilt wok to coat sides. When hot, add 1 layer of eggplant, stir-fry
until seared and tender (about 3 minutes). Remove to colander. Drain
over a bowl to catch juices. Cook remaining eggplant in same manner
adding more oil if needed. Reheat wok over medium-high heat. Add
remaining 1 tablespoon of the oil, ginger, garlic and chile; cook
gently but do not brown. Add water chestnuts and half of the green
onions; stir-fry together for 5 seconds. Increase to high heat, add
reserved soy sauce mixture and eggplant juices; bring to a boil.
Return cooked eggplant; toss quickly over high heat until most of the
sauce is reduced and absorbed into eggplant (about 1-to-2 minutes).
Fold in vinegar and sesame oil. Remove to serving dish. Top with
remaining green onions and sesame seeds. Serve hot or cold.
