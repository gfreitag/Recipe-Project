Title: EDEN SEA VEGETABLES INFORMATION
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 Info  There is no better vegetable source of minerals than sea vegetables.
Like the mineral-rich ocean, sea vegetables hold high quality
calcium, iron, potassium, zinc, and trace minerals including iodine.
They also contain vitamins A, B, C, D, E. EDEN Chooses only the
finest grades of sea vegetables. Grown in environmentally clean
waters, these premium grades are harvested at their nutritional peak
and processed using traditional techniques.

AGAR-AGAR - gelatin from a variety of seaweeds, cooked together and
allowed to harden; it is then cut into bars or made into flakes. Used
in kantens, gelatins, jams, jellies, and toppings.

ARAME - a black seaweed with a mild, sweet flavor. Arame is great with
other vegetables, or alone seasoned with brown rice vinegar and shoyu.

HIZIKI - black curls of seagrass; one of the most mineral rich foods.
A serving contains 10% of the daily recommended calcium intake. Very
tasty cooked with other vegetables for interesting and nutritious
side dishes.

KOMBU - sea kelp, highly valued as a flavor enhancer. Kombu cooked
with beans tenderizes them and makes them easier to digest. Use in
beans, soup stocks, or stews.

NORI - green laver or sea lettuce. Nori can be used as is, or toasted
over an open flame or burner for a crisper texture. Crumble it into
soups, vegetables or grains.

SUSHI Nori - tender, premium nori sheets toasted to a rich, deep green
color, ready-to-use for sushi. Can also be used as a condiment or
garnish.

WAKAME - best known for its beautiful green color and delicious taste
in miso soup, but it is also wonderful in salads, side dishes, or as a
condiment.

WAKAME FLAKES - an instant form of wakame, good in soups, salads,
stir-fry, and as a condiment. Quick and easy to use.
