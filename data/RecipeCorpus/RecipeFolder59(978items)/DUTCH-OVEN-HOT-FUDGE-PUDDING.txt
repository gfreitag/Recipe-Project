Cake Mix
2 c  Flour
4 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Salt (Optional)
1 c  Granulated Sugar
6 tb Cocoa
1/3 c  Dry Milk Powder
4 tb Margarine Or
Vegetable Shortning
2 c  Chopped Nuts (Optional)
Fudge Topping

2/3 c  Cocoa
At The Camp Site
3 1/2 c  Hot Water
Charcoal Or Alder Coals
Make the cake mix and fudge topping at home and pack into ziplock
bags for the camping trip. Mix together the cake mix ingredients
except the nuts. Use a pastry cutter to cut the margarine into the
dry ingreadients until the consistency is that of a meal.. Add the
nuts to the mixture after cutting in the margarine to make the
process easier. Place the mixture in a zip lock bag squeezing out as
much air as possible. Mix the fudge topping together and put into a
zip lock bag removing as much air as possible. At the camp site,start
the charcoal allowing about 12 coals for the bottom and 20 for the
top. Mix the cake mix with 1 cup of cold water and mix until the dry
mix is moistened. Put the cake batter on the bottom of the dutch
oven, spreading it level over the bottom. Shake the fudge topping
materials over the top of the batter, and carefully pour the hot
water over thetopping to wet it all. Put the lid on the dutch oven
and bake for 45 minutes. The cake rises ! ! to the top and the fudge
sauce to the bottom as it bakes. Watch the bottom heat to avoid
burning the bottom. Cool to taste and eat.
