1 ea Large onion, sliced
1 cn (14 1/2 oz) stewed tomatoes

MMMMM-----------------------------G----------------------------------
3 tb Flour
1/4 c  Cold water
I put everything except the additives for gravy into either a roaster
(covered), or a crockpot and let it cook on a low temperature for 4
or 5 hours.  Then, remove meat to serving plate and keep warm;
dissolve flour in cold water, then add 2 TB hot cooking liquid. Add
to remainder of cooking liquid, and stir constantly until thickened.
Serve sliced meat with hot gravy.  Makes 6-8 servings and 1 quart of
gravy.  Enjoy!!
