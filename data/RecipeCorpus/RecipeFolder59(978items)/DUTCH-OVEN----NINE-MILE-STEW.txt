Categories: Stews
1 lb Stew Meat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk stew seasoning
3    onions  -- cut
6    potatoes  -- sliced 1/8
inch
:
1 pk carrots  -- sliced
1 pk celery  -- sliced
2    green peppers  -- sliced
length way
sliced zucchini  -- enough
for one layer
:
:
:
1 lb sausage  -- patties or
links
:
1 lb cheddar cheese

Put enough oil in the oven to cover the bottom.  Sear the meat. Add
the stew seasoning.  Stir in onions. Cook for 20-30 minutes (12 coals
on bottom and 6 on top) Layer from bottom to top:
~------------------------ - potatoes - carrots - celery - green
peppers - zucchini Cook until vegetables are done (still crispy) (7-8
coals on top). Add the sausage on top.  Cook approx.  15 minutes. Add
the cheese. Serve when cheese is melted. This is not a precise
recipe. I would encourage you to add and delete items and amounts as
your taste's dictate. Be sure the vegetables, these or the ones you
may add, are stacked so the ones needing the most cooking time are on
the lower levels. Don't be tempted to add any liquid as there will be
plenty from the vegetables and meat. The original recipe called for
only 1/4 lb of stew meat, but I found that to be inadequate. Give
yourself plenty of cooking time, but don't be surprise if people want
to know when it will be done, because the smell is fantastic. This is
not a creation of mine but is definately a favorite.
