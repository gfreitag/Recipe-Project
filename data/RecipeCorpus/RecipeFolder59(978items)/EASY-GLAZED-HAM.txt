Do not preheat oven. Place ham (straight from refrigerator) on rack in
shallow roasting pan. Insert meat therometer into thickest part of
ham. Add water. Cover pan tightly with foil, leaving therometer dial
exposed. Roast in a 325ø oven for 19 to 23 minutes per pound or until
meat thermometer registers 135ø. Meanwhile, prepare desired glaze.
Remove foil and spread glaze over ham 20 minutes before the end of
cooking time. Remove ham when thermometer registers 135ø. Let ham
stand 10 minutes or until thermometer registers 140ø. (Ham will be
easier to carve.) Carve ham into slices. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
JALAPENO HAM GLAZE: In a 1-cup glass measure, combine jalapeno jelly,
cilantro and lime juice. Cook on high in a microwave oven for 45
seconds to 1 minute or until jelly is almost completely melted,
stirring halfway. Cool to thicken slightly. Brush glaze over ham
several times during the last 20 minutes of cooking. Makes 1/2 cup.
ORANGE-SPICED HAM GLAZE: In a small bowl, combine orange marmalade,
honey mustard, allspice, and red pepper; mix until well blended.
Spoon glaze over ham 20 minutes before end of cooking time. Makes 2/3
cup. GINGERY PINEAPPLE GLAZE AND SAUCE FOR HAM: In a small saucepan,
combine vinegar, garlic, and ginger. Cook 3 minutes over low heat.
Add preserves and dry mustard; cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
For glaze, spoon 1/4 cup pineapple mixture over ham 20 minutes before
end of cooking time. For sauce, dissolve cornstarch into water; add
to remaining pineapple mixture. Cook and stir 1 minute or until thick
and bubbly. Serve with ham. Makes 1/4 cup glaze and 1 cup sauce.
