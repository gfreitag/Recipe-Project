Beth's Note: Amarillo is a town of about 175,000 people in the middle
of the panhandle of Texas. Visitors expect great steaks, ranch style
barbecue and red-hot Tex-Mex cooking along the Texas stretch of
Interstates 40 and 27. But Amanllo restaurants offer other treasures
as well, thanks to the influence of newer Texans from Indochina and
Asia. Cafes with names such as the Thai Star, My Thai, Peking and
Hunan have taught Texans that jalapenos are not the only way to turn
on your taste buds. --Food Editor, Amarillo Globe-News, Amarillo

Heat butter or oil in heavy skillet or wok over high heat. Add meat 2
or 3 batches, so that each batch just covers the bottom of skillet
without crowding; brown meat. Remove browned meat from skillet and
set aside.

Reduce heat. Add onions; saute 5 minutes. Return meat to skillet. Add
celery, tomatoes, salt, pepper, sugar, bay leaves and thyme. Simmer 30
minutes. Add bell peppers; simmer 10 minutes.

In a small bowl, blend cornstarch, soy sauce and water. Stir into meat
mixture. Cook 1 minute, or until sauce is thick and clear. Serve over
hot rice.
