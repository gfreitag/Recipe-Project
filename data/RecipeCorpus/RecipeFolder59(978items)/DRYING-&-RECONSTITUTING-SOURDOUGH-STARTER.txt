DRYING SOURDOUGH STARTER:  Use a cookie sheet with a lip.  Place a
sheet of plastic wrap over the cookie sheet so in effect you have a
"plastic pan". Pour 1/2 cup of starter evenly over plastic.  It
should be a thin layer. Place on top of refrigerator for 1-1/2 days.
Peel pieces of dried starter off of plastic and turn over to continue
drying other side 1/2 day. Be sure starter is thoroughly dry or it
will mold or spoil. When starter is dry put pieces in a blender or
food processor and process until it looks like coarse flour.  Store
in an airtight container until needed. RECONSTITUTING STARTER: Add
one cup of water, 1/2 cup flour and 1 tsp. sugar to dry starter in a
plastic or glass container and follow directions for any starter use.
It takes about 24 hours for starter to activate.
