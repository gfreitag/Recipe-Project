Title: EASY FRUIT CAKE (OVO)
Categories: Digest, Dec.
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Apple sauce
3/4 c  Water
1/2 c  Sugar.
2 1/2 c  Mixed dried fruit.
(I like to use half
Currants, half raisins.)
2    Egg whites or equivalent,
Lightly beaten.
1 1/2 c  White flour.
(Whole wheat is OK, but it
Changes the taste.)
2 ts Baking powder.
Place the apple sauce, water, sugar, and dried fruit in a saucepan.
Bring to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes, then allow to cool.

Set the oven at 300 deg F (cool). Line a 6-inch round cake tin with
greaseproof paper.

Mix the egg whites into the fruit mixture, then sift the flour and
baking powder into it too. Mix, adding water if necessary to make a
stiff batter. Pour into the prepared tin, sprinkle the top with brown
sugar, and bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until a skewer inserted into
the centre of the cake comes out clean, more or less - with all this
fruit, it's not going to come out very clean anyway!

The amount and type of fruit in this recipe can be varied very much to
produce different results. Many folk in this country would use
sultanas (yellow raisins) for some of the fruit, but I don't like
them so I don't use them. You can substitute 1/2 cup of chopped glace
cherries for some of the fruit, or add chopped candied orange peel,
dates, apricots... The possibilities are endless.
