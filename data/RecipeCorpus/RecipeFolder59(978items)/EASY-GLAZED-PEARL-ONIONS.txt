Title: EASY-GLAZED PEARL ONIONS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
16 oz Frozen pearl onions
2 tb Vegetable oil
3 tb Sugar
1 1/2 c  Beef stock
4 tb Red wine vinegar
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
RINSE THE ONIONS IN A strainer, just to separate them and remove
extra ice. Blot them on paper towels. In a large, heavy skillet, heat
the oil over high heat. When it is hot, add the onions and sugar and
continue cooking for 5 minutes, shaking often, until the onions are
lightly colored. Add the beef stock, adjust the heat to medium- high,
and continue cooking until the liquid is almost completely
evaporated, about 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, cook for 30
seconds, season with salt and pepper, and serve.
