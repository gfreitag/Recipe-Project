FOR FILLING:

Peel eggplant and slice 1/2-inch thick.  Salt generously on both
sides. Drain on paper towels 45 minutes.  Pat dry with paper towels.
Cut eggplant into 1/2-inch cubes.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and
garlic and saute until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add eggplant and saute
until beginning to turn golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Stir in
wine, parsley and basil, scraping up browned bits.  Cover and cook
until eggplant is tender, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and
pepper. Transfer to processor or blender and puree until smooth. Cool
completely.

FOR PASTA:

Combine flour, eggs and salt in processor and mix well.  With machine
running, add just enough water through feed tube to form ball. Remove
from processor.  Cover dough and let rest for 30 minutes. (Pasta
dough can also be made by hand.)

Cut dough into 4 pieces.  Flatten 1 piece (keep remainder covered),
then fold in thirds.  Turn pasta machine to widest setting and run
dough through several times until smooth and velvety, folding before
each run and dusting with flour if sticky.  Adjust machine to next
narrower setting. Run dough through machine without folding. Repeat,
narrowing rollers after each run, until pasta is 1/16 to 1/8-inch
thick, dusting with flour as necessary.

Line baking sheets with towels.  Set sheet of dough on work surface.
Place about 1-1/2 teaspoons filling at 2-inch intervals along sheet.
Roll second piece of dough.  Set atop first sheet. Press down around
filling to force out air and seal dough.  Cut into 2-inch squares.
Arrange on prepared sheets.  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
Cover with towel.

FOR SAUCE:

Combine Madeira, wine and shallots in heavy small saucepan.  Boil
until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 4 minutes.  Add cream and peel and
boil 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in tomatoes.  Season
with salt and pepper.

Cook ravioli in large pot of boiling water until just tender but
still firm to bite, about 4 minutes for fresh.  Remove with slotted
spoon; drain. Divide among plates.  Spoon sauce over.  Garnish with
basil. Serve immediately.

DO AHEAD HINTS: * Ravioli can be prepared one day ahead and
refrigerated or one
month ahead, wrapped tightly and frozen.  Do not thaw before
cooking. * Sauce can be prepared one day ahead; refrigerate.

EVEN EASIER: * Purchase sheets of fresh pasta for the ravioli or buy
prepared
ravioli to serve with the tomato cream sauce here.
