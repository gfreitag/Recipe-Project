Title: EASY FISH
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Grouper or snapper fillets
-(or substitute boneless,
-skinless chicken breast)
Salt
Pepper
Flour
2 tb Olive or vegetable oil
4 tb Butter, optional
1    Juice of lemon (opt)
Sprinkle fish fillets (or chicken pieces) liberally with salt and
pepper. Coat the pieces with flour, patting them firmly, then shaking
off excess flour.

Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wide skillet (or 2 wide skillets), and
cook the fish over medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes, until browned.
Turn fish pieces over and cook another 3-4 minutes longer.

Remove fish from skillet and keep warm. Add butter and heat until it
turns a deep brown. Remove from heat and add juice of one fresh
lemon. Pour over fish or chicken. This final sauce may be augmented
with capers or minced garlic, if desired. Add them after butter
before lemon juice.
