Title: EGGS BAKED IN PEPPERS - WASHINGTON TIME
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lg Round red peppers
8    Eggs
Salt and pepper
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 c  Tomato sauce
1. Select well-shaped peppers that will sit upright. Halve them
crosswise and remove seeds.  Trim stems but do not make a hole. 2.
Parboil peppers in simmering, salted water until just tender, then
drain peppers. 3. Break eggs 2 eggs into each pepper half.  Season
and top with a 1/2 tablespoon slice of butter.  Place peppers in
small baking pan, pour in 1 inch of hot poaching water, and bake
briefly at 375 degrees until eggs set. 4. Ribbon with tomato sauce.

My suggestions.  Try a spice such as Szechuan Style Pepper or Herb
Pepper Blend instead of the salt and pepper. (Szechuan is copied from
the label of a McCormick spice jar. Spell checker suggests the
spelling Szechwan.)

This also could be cooked at a low at a medium setting in a microwave
oven.
