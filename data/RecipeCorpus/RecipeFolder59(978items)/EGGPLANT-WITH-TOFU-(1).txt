Title: EGGPLANT WITH TOFU (1)
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-==================
Ingredients:

3/4 lb   Japanese eggplant (about 3 cups sliced) 1/4 lb tofu 6 T oil
2-3 cloves garlic, crushed 1-5 red chili peppers, seeded and chopped
10-15 sweet basil leaves 1-3 T yellow bean sauce (yellow bean sauce
from Thailand is saltier than sauce from Hong Kong or China, so
season to taste) Slice unpeeled eggplant crosswise into slices
1/8-inch thick. Cut tofu into 1/2-inch cubes.  Heat oil in skillet;
add garlic and stir-fry until light brown (don't burn!).  Add
eggplant and tofu and cook for 5 to 7 minutes. Add remaining
ingredients; mix gently. Serve immediately, since eggplant and basil
turn dark if dish sits after cooking. Makes 3 to 4 servings.
