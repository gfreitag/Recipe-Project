Title: DUMPLINGS FROM LITHUANIA
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
500 g  Potatoes
2    Eggs
1    Onions
2 tb Sour cream
100 g  Cooked rice
Cooking oil, bread crumbs,
-salt, pepper
Peel, boil and mash potatoes.  Add one egg, salt. Mix, shape into flat
cakes.  Prepare filling: Wash and slice mushrooms. Fry in oil with
onions, salt and pepper; add sour cream. Cook over low flame, add
rice. Place filling in the middle of each patty and seal edges (here
she means to fold the patty over the filling)-- the dumplings should
be somewhat elongated when shaped (make an oval, not a round). Dip
each dumpling in beaten egg, roll in bread crumbs and fry in boiling
oil (this is deep-frying, I suppose, but I brush them with oil and
bake on an oiled baking sheet at 350F for 10 or 15 minutes each
side). When golden brown, serve.

Serves four.
