MMMMM--------------------KAY BURGER  XWSF96A-------------------------
1/2 c  Shortening
4 ts Salt
2 ts Sugar
2 c  Boiling water
2 pk Active yeast
5 c  Flour
Put shortening, salt and sugar in large bowl. Pour boiling water
over all and stir until shortening melts. Let cool to lukewarm.
Sprinkle yeast over this; stir to dissolve; let stand until mixture
begins to bubble. Add flour and beat.
Roll out on floured board to about 3/8-inch thickness. Cut with
round cutter, I use clean, empty tuna can. Sprinkle cookie sheets
with cornmeal. Set muffins on these, fairly far apart. Let rise to
double in bulk. Set griddle or electric frypan to 350~. Sprinkle with
cornmeal. Put muffins, rounded side down, on griddle and bake 7
minutes. Turn and bake 7 minutes on the other side. Split with fork,
and toast or spread with butter and put under broiler until butter
bubbles.
These muffins freeze successfully. They should be split with fork
before freezing. The recipe may be doubled when preparing muffins for
the freezer. When I make these, I make 5 or 6 recipes!!!!

They are even better than Wolfermans!!!  I could eat these till I
pop!!!!  Yum!
