Categories: Creole, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lg Eggplants, split lengthwise
2    Jars (10 ounces each)
-oysters
3 tb Olive oil
1 1/2 c  Finely diced onion
2 lg Garlic cloves, minced
1/2 ts Herbes de Provence
1/2 ts Creole seafood seasoning
2 tb Dry white wine
I cup fresh bread crumbs
1 tb Minced chives
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan
Creole-style seafood seasoning blends are sold in most markets; you
can use a mixture of salt and red, white and black peppers.
Chesapeake- style seasonings, such as Old Bay, are another option.

Bake the eggplant halves in a 400F oven until just tender. Scrape out
the pulp, leaving a shell about 1/2 inch thick attached to the skin.
Discard any big clumps of seeds and chop the pulp coarsely. Drain the
oysters, reserving the liquor.  Chop oysters into bite-sized pieces.

Heat the oil in a skillet; add the onion and garlic and cook until the
onion softens.  Add the herbs and seasoning mix, then stir in the
oyster liquor and wine. Reduce slightly, then stir in the eggplant
pulp, bread crumbs, oysters and chives.  Cook for 1 minute, then
taste for seasoning and adjust to taste. Spread the mixture evenly in
the eggplant shells and top with Parmesan.  Return to the oven and
bake until nicely browned.

Serves 4.
