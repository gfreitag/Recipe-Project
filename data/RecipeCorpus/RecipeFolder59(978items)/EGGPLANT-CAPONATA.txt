Yield: 1 Quart
2    Medium eggplants
1/2 c  Vegetable stock
2    Onions, sliced
1 c  Diced celery
3/4 c  Tomato puree
1/2 c  Vinegar

Preheat oven to 400F.  Place the eggplants on a baking sheet and
prick with a fork.  Bake until tender but not mushy, about 35-45
minutes. When the eggplants are cool enough to handle, remove the
peel and dice the flesh into 1-inch cubes.  Place the cubes in a
strainer or drainer. In a large saute pan over moderate heat, bring
the stock to a boil. Add the onions and cook until tender, about 10
minutes.  Add the celery and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the tomato
puree, vinegar, and sugar, and simmer a few minutes. Stir in ther
eserved eggplant, capers, and raisins and warm through.  Adjust the
seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve at room temperature.  This can
be made a few days ahead of time. Bring to room temperature for
serving, check seasoning, and add vinegar and salt if desired.
