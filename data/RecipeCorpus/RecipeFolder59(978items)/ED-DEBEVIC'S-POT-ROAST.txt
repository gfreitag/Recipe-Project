Trim excess fat from the meat.  Season the meat with some salt and
pepper. Coat with the 1/4 cup flour.  In a 4-5 quart Dutch oven or
kettle, brown meat on both sides in hot oil. Remove meat, leaving
drippings in the Dutch oven. Add onion, garlic, celery, thyme and bay
leaves. Cook and stir about 5 minutes or till vegetables are just
tender. Stir in the tomato paste and burgundy.  Let simmer,
uncovered, for 5 minutes to reduce sauce, stirring to scrape up
browned bits in pan. Add the au jus sauce, salt (if you like), pepper
and crushed red pepper. Bring to boiling. Add meat to sauce in the
Dutch oven.

Cover and bake in a 325 degree oven for 3 1/2 to 4 hours or till meat
is very tender and falls off the bone. (For just-tender meat, bake
for only 2 hours.)

Remove meat from pan.  Remove and discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves.
Combine the remaining 1/4 cup flour with water. Stir into sauce in
pan. Cook and stir till thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 1
minute more. Serve with meat. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
