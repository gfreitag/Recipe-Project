While the eggplant is roasting, heat a large nonstick skillet over

Scoop out eggplant flesh and chop coarsely.  Stir rice, beef broth,
chopped eggplant and the reserved lamb into the tomato mixture; bring
to a simmer. Cover the pan and place it in the oven. Bake for 30 to
35 minutes, or until the rice is tender and th e liquid has been
