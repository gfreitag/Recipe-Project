7 1/2 oz White chocolate;
Chopped into 1/4" pieces
8 oz Semi-sweet chocolate;
-chopped into 1/4" pieces
3/4 c  Heavy cream
5 tb Unsweetened cocoa
EQUIPMENT: Cutting board, cook's knife, measuring cup, measuring
spoons, 2 stainless steel bowls, 1 1/2-quart saucepan, 2 whisks,
baking sheet, parchment paper. Place the white and dark chocolates
into separate stainless steel bowls. Heat the cream in a 1 1/2-quart
saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil. Pour 1/4 c of boiling
cream over the white chocolate and the remaining 1/2 c over the dark
chocolate and allow to stand for 4 to 5 minutes. Stir each with a
separate whisk until smooth, and allow to cool for 1 hour at room
temperature. Refrigerate the two ganaches for 15 minutes, stirring
every 5 minutes.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Portion 36 heaping
teaspoons of dark chocolate into separate mounds onto the parchment
paper. Top each teaspoon of dark chocolate with a level teaspoon of
white chocolate.

To fashion the truffles, roll each portion of chocolate in your palms
in a gently circular motion, using just enough pressure to form
smooth rounds. Roll the rounds of chocolate in cocoa until completely
covered.
