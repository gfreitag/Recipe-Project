in warm place (80 to 85 F) for 30 minutes (batter should not double
in size); stir down. Spoon batter into greased pans. Cover; let rise
again for 15 minutes (batter should not double in size.) Preheat oven

minutes until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pan
immediately. Cool on rack. Brush top of loaf with melted butter, if
desired. High altitude (5200 feet): Increase temperature 25 degrees
