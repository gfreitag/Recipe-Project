MMMMM---------------------------STACKS--------------------------------
2 sm Eggplants
8 sl Onion; cut 1/2-in. thick
1/2    Lemon; juice only
8 sl Tomato; cut 1/2-in. thick
Salt, black pepper
2    Onions; thinly sliced
1 tb Butter or margarine
1 tb Oil
2 tb Chopped parsley
To make sauce, melt 2 tablespoons butter in small saucepan. Blend in
flour and mustard. Stir in milk until smooth. Bring to boil, stirring
constantly. Cook, stirring, until thickened, about 1 minute. Stir in
cheese until melted. Season to taste with salt, white pepper and hot
pepper sauce. Set aside.

To make stacks, cut each eggplant crosswise into three or four
1-inch-thick slices, including bottom and stem end. Trim bottom so it
will stand level. Parboil eggplant and 1/2-inch onion slices in small
amount of water to which lemon juice has been added. Cover and cook 5
minutes. Turn eggplant slices at halfway point in cooking. Drain on
paper towels. Place bottom eggplant slices side by side in
9-inch-square baking dish. Top each with 1 parboiled onion slice and
1 tomato slice and spoon over 1/4 cup cheese sauce. Season to taste
with salt and pepper. Cover with next largest eggplant slice and
repeat stacking with onion slices, tomato slices, cheese sauce and
salt and black pepper to taste. Top each with its stem end. To hold
layers in place, insert 2 or 3 long bamboo skewers lengthwise through
each eggplant stack. Saute thinly sliced onions in 1 tablespoon
butter and oil in large heavy skillet until transparent. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. Spoon onions around eggplant in baking
dish. Sprinkle with parsley. Bake at 350F 20 to 25 minutes or until
vegetables are tender. If necessary, add small amount of water to pan
to keep onions from scorching. Remove skewers and slice lengthwise
into wedges to serve. Serve additional cheese sauce on side.
