Comment:  the spice level is very subtle.  For a spicier version,
increase the amount of spice and/or add in some stronger ones such as
ginger, anise, cloves.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Boil for 3 minutes the water (beer), raisins, brown sugar, butter,
spices, and salt. Cool.

Sift together the cake four, baking powder and baking soda.

Stir the flour gradually into the other ingredients. Stir until
smooth. Add almonds.  [If making the fruit cake variation, add the
remaining ingredients.]

Bake in a greased tube pan for 1 hour or more.  Frost with caramel
icing.
