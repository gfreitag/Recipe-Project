Heat oven to 350 degrees.  In small bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar
and lemon juice; beat until smooth. Separate dough into 8 rectangles;
firmly press perforations to seal.  Spread each rectangle with about
2 T cream cheese mixture.  Starting at longer side, roll up each
rectangle, firmly pinching edges and ends to seal. Gently stretch
each roll to about 10 inches.  On ungreased large cookie sheet, coil
each roll into a spiral with seam on the inside, tucking end under.
Make deep indentation in center of each roll; fill with 1/2 t
preserves.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes or until deep
golden brown. In small bowl, blend all glaze ingredients, adding
enough milk for desired drizzling consistency. Drizzle over warm
rolls. Barbara S. Gibson, IN.
