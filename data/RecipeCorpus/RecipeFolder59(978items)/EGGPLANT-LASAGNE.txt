Wash, peel and slice eggplant into 1/4" pieces. Spread slices out on
racks or paper towels, then sprinkle with lemon juice and salt. Let
stand 5-10 min then wipe off with paper towels. While eggplant is
standing, mix flour, cornmeal, oregano, garlic powder and black
pepper together in a bowl. Preheat oven to 350. Dredge eggplant
slices in flour-cornmeal mix. Lay on cookie sheet spread with the
oil. Oven-fry slices for 8-10 min on each side or until golden brown.

Ricotta-Style Filling: While the eggplant slices are baking, prepare
the tofu filling. Process the tofu, lemon juice, basil, honey, salt
and garlic in food processor to a fine grainy texture like ricotta
cheese.

Cover bottom of 8x8" pan with 1/3 of the tomato sauce. Use half the
oven fried eggplant slices to cover the bottom of the pan. Then
spread the tofu filling over, reserving 1/2 cup for the top. Next,
cover the tofu filling with the rest of the eggplant slices, and pour
the remaining tomato sauce over the top. Arrange reserved tofu mix in
small dollops over the top. Bake about 45 min or until dollops are
slightly browned.
