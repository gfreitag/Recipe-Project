Title: EASY TOFFEE
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Batch
1 lb Butter
2 c  Sugar, superfine
1 1/2 c  Pecans; minced
10    Hershey bars
Line a jelly roll pan with foil, and grease the foil with the
wrappers from the butter. Put the butter, sugar, and one cup of
pecans in a cold skillet. Bring to a boil over pretty high heat (I
use a 5-1/2 on a scale of 8, on the big burner of my stove), stirring
constantly. Boil 13 to 18 minutes (13 is always enough for me),
stirring *constantly*. DO NOT let up on the stirring, or it will
stick!  Pour into the jellyroll pan and spread. Let cool for a few
minutes, then place the chocolate bars on top. When the chocolate is
mushy, spread it evenly over the surface of the candy and sprinkle
with the remaining pecans.
