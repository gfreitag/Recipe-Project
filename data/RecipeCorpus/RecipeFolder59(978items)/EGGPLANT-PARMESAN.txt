2/3 c  Fine bread crumbs

1/2 c  Parmesan,grated
* 4 cups of sauce (your favorite) with or without meat Dredge eggplant
slices in flour, dip in egg, and coat with bread crumbs. Fry breaded
slices in olive oil until they are dark golden and offer little
resistance to a fork. Drain on paper towels.

In a 9 x 12 x 3-inch casserole, dpoon a thin layer of tomato sauce
over the bottom. Put down a single layer of fried eggplant slices,
followed by a generous layer of sauce, mozzarella slices, and a
sprinkling of Parmesan. Continue reapeating process until eggplant

eggplant), ending with a final layer of sliced mozzarella on top.

melted and browned nicely. You can use the broiler for browning
during the last few minutes, but don't over do it.
