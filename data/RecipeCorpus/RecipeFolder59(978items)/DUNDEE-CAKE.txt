110 g  Currants, cleaned
110 g  Raisins, cleaned and stoned
50 g  Mixed peel, chopped
75 g  Glace cherries, chopped

(For a 18cm-cake tin)

Grease and line the base and sides of the tin and grease the paper
lining.

Mix the sultanas, currants, raisins, peel, cherries and ground almonds
together.

Beat the butter until it is soft and creamy then add the caster sugar
and beat the mixture with the lemon rind until light and fluffy in
both colour and texture. Beat the eggs together then add them
gradually to the creamed mixture, beating well between each addition.
Sift together the flour and baking powder and lightly stir it into
the creamed mixture with the sherry and all the dried fruit.

Turn the mixture into the tin, spread it to the sides and slightly
hollow out the centre, then cover the surface with the almonds.

Bake the cake at 160 oC (325 oF) for 2.5 - 3 hours or until a warm
skewer pushed into the mixture comes out clean.

Cool the cake in the tin for 15 minutes then turn it out onto a wire
tray to cool completely.

(casted sugar = granulated sugar, Glace cherries = candied cherries,
Sultanas = seedless white raisins)
