1    Bulb of fresh fennel (anise)
4 tb Chopped garlic or more
-if you like
Salt and plenty of fresh
-ground pepper
Get a leg of lamb and ask the butcher to bone it and butterfly it
for you. Do not let him tie it in a roast but ask him for some
butcher string so you can do it by yourself. When you get the lamb
home, try to remove as much fat from the inside as possible if the
butcher didn`t clean it well. Now you are going to make your own
roast of boneless lamb.

To begin...Lay the meat out flat on a large clean surface skin side
down. Cut off the fuzzy top of the fennel and wash thoroughly. cut
into 4" stalks using everything (save the bulb) Cover the meat first
with salt and pepper. Spread the garlic all over the meat. Lay the
pieces of fennel next spread over the meat. Now roll up like a
jellyroll and start tying with the string about 2 " apart. Get it as
tight as you can. Then tie it lengthwise tucking the ends in. Place
in a roasting pan and lightly oil top and sides. Salt an pepper the
roast. Cut the fennel bulb into chunks and drizzle with about 2 tbls
of melted butter or oli. Bake at 350 for about 1 hour covered. Turn
every 1/2 hour. Remove cover and continue to bake 1 hour uncovered.
Before the last 1/2 hour add 1/2 cup white wine. When done, remove
the meat to a warm platter. Do not cut too early, lamb gets cold
fast. Put the roasting pan on top of the stove and make a gravy with
the drippings. Add flour and water. You may even use a bit more wine
or broth, adjust for salt, strain and serve on the side for the meat
or mashed potatoes.
