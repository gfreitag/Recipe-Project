Title: EASY BRISKET
Categories: Main
Yield: 1 Servings
SEE DIRECTIONS:
I love brisket but always need to simplify my cooking. I am enclosing
the easiest brisket recipe I have ever found that is great! It also
reheats very well in the microwave covered with lid or saran wrap.
This will be our Easter dinner.

Day before cooking: Marinate the brisket in 1 bottle of Liquid Smoke,
after salting with onion salt, garlic salt, and celery salt.

Day of serving: Heat oven to 250 degrees. Pour one bottle of your
favorite barbeque sauce over the brisket, cover, and cook for 2-3
hours, depending on size. When done, let sit one hour before serving.

It doesn't get much easier than this but the taste is divine and only
one pan is dirty.  Great served with lots of vegetables.
