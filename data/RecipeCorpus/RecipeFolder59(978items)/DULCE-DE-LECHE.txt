Title: DULCE DE LECHE
Categories: Deserts, Italian, Puddings
Yield: 10 Servings
1    Gal milk.
8 c  Sugar
First boil the milk on medium heat Add the sugar, stirr well and keep
stirring constantly, so that it doesn't stick on the bottom of the
pam. The milk will evaporate and the color will change to yellowish.

For a hard dulce de leche, let the milk evaporate till it gets very
thick in the pan you are cooking.  Then coat a a square pan with
butter, spread the contents on it & put it in the oven to dry for a
few minutes.

For a soft dulce de leche, don't let it get too thick while you
cooking it, then keep in a jar and eat as a spread.

It is really delicious. Sometimes I add peanuts or cinamon for a
variation. I am from Latin America, and talking about this bring me
good memories....

Enjoy! It ready when it changes the color from white to yellowish It
is very very simple.  But you need to keep an eye on the pan. Walt MM
