Title: EGGPLANT & MUSHROOM STROGONOFF <T>
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 md Eggplant
1 1/2 lb Mushrooms, cut into thick
sl (1/3-1/2 in.)
(I used button and crimini;
Didn't care for the shitaake
Though)
2/3 c  Homemade soup mix (recipe
Below) plus 2 c. water OR
2 cn Lowfat Cream of Mushroom
Soup
4    Cloves crushed garlic (or to
Taste)
1 tb Paprika (or to taste; I use
More!)
1 ts Nutmeg (or to taste)
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 c  Each balsamic vinegar &
White wine for sauteing
Cut the eggplant into thick slices (can leave skin on, if desired)
salted the slices, and let them drain for about half an hour or so.
Pat them dry with a paper towel, then cut into bite-sized chunks.
(The salting/draining helps keep the eggplant from getting bitter.)

In a cup, mix equal parts of balsamic vinegar and white wine for
sauteing. Add crushed garlic to this mixture, and use this to saute
eggplant until it is nice and soft (15-20 minutes at medium heat).
Remove eggplant, and saute mushrooms in remaining vinegar/wine
mixture until they release their juices. Stir in eggplant, then add
soup mix and water (or canned soup, if using that). Add paprika,
nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, and cook 5-6 minutes until sauce
has thickened and veggies are heated through. Add additional water if
sauce is too thick, and do not overcook.

Serve over rice or fetticine noodles. Makes plenty for 4-6 hungry
people. Recipe can be halved.

I got this soup recipe off this group, but unfortunately lost the
name of the author. Its really wonderful! The only comment is that I
use less water when making cream sauces than is suggested here.
