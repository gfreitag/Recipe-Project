Bake & debone duck; save crispy skin for pie crust.

While Duck is roasting, make sauce for pot pie: chop up giblets
(except for neck) and brown all pieces in clarified butter over
medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, carrot and celery. When onions are
translucent, add enough water to cover, then the wine, vinegar, bay
leaf, sage and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for 30 minutes,
reduce liquid to one cup, then remove neck and bayleaf.

Make a roux with flour and butter, stirring constantly until flour is
a medium brown. Add the giblet stock, grated orange peel, Triple Sec
and the apple juice, stirring constantly to keep sauce smooth. When
sauce is medium thick, remove from heat.

Line 9" deep dish pie pan with bottom crust. Add meat, broccoli,
leeks, diced celery, peppers and ginger, and pour sauce over all.

Roll pieces of reserved crispy duck skin into top crust, then cover
pie and seal and crimp edges. Bake at 425 degrees for 35-40 minutes
or until crust browns.

This is a nice, hot, wintertime or rainy day entree. Recipe fashioned
