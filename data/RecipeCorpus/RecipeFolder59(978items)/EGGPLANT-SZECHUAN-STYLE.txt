Everyone loves this dish, even those who don't particularly like egg
plant. The flavor virtually explodes with a lively combination of
sweet, spicy, tart and savory followed by the refreshing crunch of
fresh water chestnuts. Serve as a side dish or first course for
Western menus.

Cut eggplant into 1/2-inch wide by 2-inch long strips.

Mix together soy sauce, sugar and chicken stock. Set aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a wide, flat skillet. When hot, add
half of the eggplant. Saute, stirring constantly until seared and
wilted, about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate. Cook remaining eggplant,
adding more oil if needed. Transfer to plate. Set aside.

Heat a wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add remaining 1
tablespoon oil, the ginger, garlic and chile; cook gently but do not
brown. Add water chestnuts and half of the green onions; stir-fry for
5 seconds. Increase heat to high, add reserved soy sauce mixture and
the eggplant. Toss quickly over high heat until the sauce is reduced
and absorbed into eggplant, 1 to 2 minutes. Fold in vinegar and
sesame oil. Remove to a serving dish. Top with remaining green onions
and sesame seeds. Serve hot or cold.
