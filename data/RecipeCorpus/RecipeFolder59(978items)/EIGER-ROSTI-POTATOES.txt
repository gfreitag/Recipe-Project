Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
6    Pontiac potatoes
1 sm Onion
1    To 2 tablespoons margarine
Boil the potatoes in their jackets until just tender. Cool and store
in the fridge to firm up for at least one day, prefer- ably two. When
ready to use, grate potato coarsely, finely chop the onion, mix
together and season to taste. (Ruth says you can also add chopped
bacon, to make speck rosti, though this is usually a breakfast dish.)

Heat the margarine in a frying pan and add potato mixture. Do not
press it down; keep it loose and light. Cook it for 10-15 minutes on
medium heat, turning it in sections a couple of times. Towards the
end, leave it to form a golden brown crust on the bottom. Turnout,
crust upwards, onto a platter and serve.
