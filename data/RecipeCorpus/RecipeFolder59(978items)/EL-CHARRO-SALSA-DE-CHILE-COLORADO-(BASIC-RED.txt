Salsa De Chile Colorado is used in countless Mexican dishes. It is
available canned and is usually called enchilada sauce. But nothing
commercial is as good as the sauce you make yourself from dried red
chile peppers.

To prepare a sauce, the peppers are softened in boiling water, then
ground into a rich red paste. The paste is thinned with the cooking
liquid for use as a sauce for enchiladas, et cetera. Left unthinned
and spiced with oregano and vinegar it becomes adobada and is used as
a marinade for carne (beef) adobada or puerco (pork) adobada.

Wash chiles in cold water and remove stems. Cook in boiling water
until tender. Remove chiles and reserve the cooking liquid.

Place a few of the chiles in a blender, along with 1/2 cup resreved
liquid, and blend to a paste. Remove to bowl. Repeat with remaining
chiles. (It is now unseasoned red chile paste).

Heat oil in a large skillet. Add garlic puree and flour, stirring
until four browns. Add the chile paste, stirring constantly until it
boils and thickens. Season with salt. Thin slightly with cooking
liquid.
