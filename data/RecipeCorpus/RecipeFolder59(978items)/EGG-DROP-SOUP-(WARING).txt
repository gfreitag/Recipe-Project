Title: EGG DROP SOUP (WARING)
Categories: Soups, Eggs, Chinese
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 qt Chicken broth, or
-clear soup stock
2 tb Cornstarch; mixed in
1/4 c  ;Water, cold
2    Egg; slightly beaten with a
-fork
2    Scallion; chopped, including
-green ends
Bring soup stock to a boil.  Slowly pour in the cornstarch mixture
while stirring the stock, until the stock thickens. Reduce heat so
stock just simmers. Pour in the eggs slowly while stirring the soup.
As soon as the last bit of egg is in, shut off heat at once. Serve
with chopped scallions on top.

Substitutions and Variations

Tomato Egg-Drop soup is just a variation of plain egg-drop soup. The
added tartness of tomatoes gives this soup an extra "zing" and helps
to pick up sagging appetites. The addition of 1 medium-size can of
stewed tomatoes is all that is needed.  Bring stock to a boil. Add
the tomatoes. (Mash the tomatoes if the pieces are too large.) When
soup boils again, add the cornstarch mixture as before.  Add the eggs
while stirring. Shut off heat at once and serve topped with the
chopped scallions.
