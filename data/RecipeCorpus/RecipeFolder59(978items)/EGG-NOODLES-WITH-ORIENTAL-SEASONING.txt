Yield: 4 Servings
4 oz Medium or Wide Egg Noodles
-- uncooked
1/4 c  Water
2 tb Low-sodium soy sauce
1 ts Vinegar
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Cornstarch

2    Scallions; trimmed

Prepare egg noodles according to package directions. While egg
noodles are cooking, stir the water, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and
cornstarch together in a small bowl until the sugar and cornstarch
are dissolved. Set aside.

When noodles are done, drain well. Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or
large, deep skillet over high heat. Add the scallions, garlic and
ginger and stir until the garlic and ginger are fragrant, about 15
seconds. Add the snow peas and toss just until they begin to change
color, about 10 seconds. Add noodles and toss with the seasoned oil.
Stir in the soy sauce mixture and pour all into the wok. Stir well
until the sauce is thickened and the noodles are evenly distributed.
Transfer immediately to a serving dish. Serve hot.
