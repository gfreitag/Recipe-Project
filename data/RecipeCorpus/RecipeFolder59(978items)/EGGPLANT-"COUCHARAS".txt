Title: EGGPLANT "COUCHARAS"
Categories: Vegetables, Side, Dish
Yield: 6 To 8
2 md Eggplants (smooth skin)
3 cl Garlic, mashed
3    Eggs, beaten
2 1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese
1/4 c  Matzo or bread crumbs
2 tb Olive oil
Salt and pepper, to taste
Freshly-grated nutmeg
Stem the eggplants and cut each into half, lengthwise. Cut each half
crosswise, into 4 chunks.  In covered saucepan, simmer chunks in
water to cover for 15 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool. Then,
separate pulp from skin, taking care not to tear skin. Reserve skin.*

In a bowl, vigorously mash pulp with garlic.  Mix in remaining
ingredients, except for 1/2 cup of the cheddar cheese and the nutmeg.
Combine thoroughly. Add more matzo or bread crumbs, if mixture seems
too thin.

Mound skins with mixture,* place on well-oiled baking sheet. Sprinkle
with a little of the reserved cheese and a bit of ground nutmeg. Bake
in preheated 350 degree oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown on
top.

*or pile mixture on small, individual gratin dishes

VARIATION:

Makes a beautiful fritada by adding 8 oz. of cottage cheese to filling
mixture.  Line a 9x13 glass dish OR a fritada pan with the skins,
shiny side down. Spread mixture evenly over the skins. (You don't
have to use the skins, if you wish.)  Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2
cup of grated cheddar, plus a light dusting of ground nutmeg. Bake in
a preheated 350 degree oven for
1    hour.

Both variations excellent with Mediterranean meals, particularly
