Title: EASY CHERRY PUDDING
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-===================
Ingredients:

1/2 cup  margarine 1 cup flour 1 cup sugar 2 tsp baking powder 3/4
cup milk or water 1 1lb can pitted cherries with syrup 1/2 cup sugar
Melt the margarine and place in a baking pan.

Mix the flour, sugar (1 cup only) baking powder and milk/water
together. Pour on top of the melted margarine. DO NOT MIX!

Pour the cherries with the syrup over the flour/milk mixture. DO NOT
MIX! Sprinkle the 1/2 cup suger over the entire mess, and bake in a
350 degree oven for one hour.

This can be served either hot or cold.  If served hot, icecream would
definately not detract from this dish.

Variations:

Basically any kind of canned fruit can be used.  I've made plum
pudding (a la Little Jack Horner), pineapple pudding, whatever come
to mind and off the shelf. Just remember that if the fruit has pits,
to remove them.

I tried this once with fresh fruit, and it just didn't work. This is
one of those dishes meant for canned fruit. Converted by MMCONV vers.
