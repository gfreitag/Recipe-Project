constantly, until thickened. Keep warm while cooking egg mixture.

Beat eggs until very thick and light.  Fold in pork, onions, bean
sprouts, and mushrooms.  Heat fat in frypan over moderate heat. Pour

NOTE: For this recipe, use only clean eggs with no cracks in shells.

[Karen feels compelled to add: Because of the risk of salmonella
poisoning, it's been widely recommended that children, the elderly,
and immuno-compromised persons avoid consuming any raw or undercooked
eggs.]
