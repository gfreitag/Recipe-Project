Title: EGG CUSTARD
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Eggs
1 tb Sugar
3/4 pt Milk
Little grated nutmeg
1.  Beat the eggs with a fork, add the sugar and warmed milk. 2. The
milk MUST NOT BOIL, otherwise it will curdle the eggs. 3. Pour into a
greased pie dish or basin, grating the nutmeg on top.

BAKED CUSTARD

1.  Half fill a dish, slightly larger than the pie dish, with cold
water. 2.  Stand the pie dish in this, then bake for about 1 1/4
hours in the centre of a slow oven (275-300F Gas mark 1-2) until
firm. Too geat a heat causes curdling and will spoil the custard.

STEAMED CUSTARD

1.  Put the basin into the steamer over very hot water, and cook
steadily for about 1 1/4 hours.  The water must never boil, otherwise
the custard will curdle. 2. Test with your fingers, if you can just
bear it in the water the heat is just right. 3. Cool slightly, then
you can turn out the custard.
