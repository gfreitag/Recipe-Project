until softened.  Stir in ham, corned beef, and garlic. Cook the mixture,
stirring, for 1 minute.  Stir in 6 Tbsp flour and cook mixture over
moderate heat, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Stir in kraut, parsley, and broth
and cook for 3 minutes or until it is thickened and paste-like. Spread
mixture on a platter and chill for at least 3 hours.

In a bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and 2 1/2 cups flour. Shape the
kraut mixture by level teaspoons into balls, dip them into the egg mixture
and roll them in the bread crumbs.

In a kettle, heat 2 inches of oil to 375f on a thermometer.  Fry the balls
in batches for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to paper towels
to drain.
