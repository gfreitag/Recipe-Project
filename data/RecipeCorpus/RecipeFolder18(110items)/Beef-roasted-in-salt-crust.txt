Title: Beef roasted in salt crust
Categories: Beef
Servings:  6
6 lb Standing rib roast, trimmed
3 c  Coarse kosher salt
In a bowl, stir together the salt and 3/4 cup water until the mixture forms
a slightly stiff paste, resembling wet snow. Arrange the roast, fat side
up, in a roasting pan, and coat completely with the salt mixture, patting
it on about 1/4-inch thick.

Roast the beef in the middle of a preheated 325f oven for 2 hours (about 22
minutes per pound) or until it registers 130f on a meat thermometer.
Transfer to a cutting board and let it stand for 15 minutes.

Remove crust with a hammer, carve and serve.
