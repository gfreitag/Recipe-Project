Degrees)
2 tb Honey
1    Egg white lightly beaten
5 c  Flour
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 tb Kosher (or regular) salt
1 1/2 c  Warm water (110 to 115
In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine 1 cup of the flour, the yeast and
salt.  Add the water and honey and beat until smooth. Add the remaining
flour,1 cup at a time, to make a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a
generously floured board and continue working on the flour until the dough
is stiff enough to knead. Knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 10 minutes.
Cover with a towel and let rise 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 to 12
equal portions.  Shape each portion into a flattened ball. With your
forefinger, poke a hole in the center. Stretch and rotate the dough until
the hole is 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide. Place the bagels on a well-floured
board, cover with another towel, and let them rise for 20 minutes. Preheat
oven to 375 degrees. Fill a large shallow pan (a wok works well) with 3
inches of water. Bring the water to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer. Add
a few bagels at a time and simmer for 5 minutes (turning once or twice).
Remove the bagels from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on a towel.
Place the bagels on well-oiled baking sheets, brush with egg white and
sprinkle with topping of your choice. Bake for 30 minutes, until well
browned.  Transfer to racks to cool. SUGGESTED TOPPINGS: Kosher salt,
finely chopped onions or garlic, poppy, sesame or caraway seeds.
