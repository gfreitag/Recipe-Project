1 c  Shortening (lard, butter or

-Money uses 1/2
2 2/3 c  All-purpose flour (Money

1 t  Salt
cup Crisco and 1/2 cup Butter Flavor Crisco shortening) 7-8 T Ice
water FILLING: 2 C Butternut squash (one-inch cubes, cooked and

1/2 C Granulated sugar 2 T All-purpose flour 1/2 t Lemon extract 1/2
t Cinnamon 1/8 t Salt 1/4   t Nutmeg 1/4 t Ground cloves 1 t Melted
butter Heat oven to 400 degrees. For crust, combine flour and salt in
a medium bowl. Cut in shortening with pastry blender or two knifes
until flour forms pea-sized chunks. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon ice water
over one small section of flour mixture and mix lightly with a fork.
Repeat, rotating bowl, one section at a time. Form two thirds of
dough into large ball, then press down to form a 5-6" diameter
"pancake" (remainder of dough can be rolled out into a rectangle,
sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, rolled and cut into little
pinwheels, brushed with butter and a sugar-water glaze and baked
separately). Sprinkle flour on rolling (preferably taped-down pastry
cloth) and, with flour-dusted rolling pin, roll dough into circle
until dough is about 1/4 of an inch thick. Trim one inch larger than
inverted 10" Pyrex pie plate. Carefully roll pastry onto rolling pin,
then unroll it onto right-side-up pie plate. Press into pie plate.
Fold edge under. Flute 1/2" high edge. Cover with plastic wrap.
Refrigerate. Combine all ingredients in mixing bowl and mix at medium
speed for 5 minutes. Pour into chilled pastry shell.  Cover edge of
pie with long strip of aluminum foil to prevent overbrowning.  Bake
10 minutes at 400 degrees F. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F. and bake
for 25 minutes.  Remove foil. Bake 10-15 minutes more, or until knife
inserted in center comes out clean and crust is golden brown. From
