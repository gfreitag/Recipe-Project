Recipe by: Lorna Sass Preparation Time: 0:12 In a large bowl, combine
all ingredients except the tomato sauce and water. Roll into about
17-18 meatballs, each about 2 inches in diameter.

Pour the tomato sauce into the cooker and thin by stirring in the
water. Set the meatballs side by side in the sauce; don't stack them
on top of each other.  (You may have to cook the meatballs in two
batches.)

Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure.
Adjust the heat to maintain high pressure and cook for 5 minutes. Let
the pressure drip naturally, about 7 minutes. Remove the lid, tilting
it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape.

Check for doneness by splitting open a meatball and making sure that
the rice on the inside is thoroughly cooked.  If not, lock the lid
back in place and let the meatballs steam in the residual heat for a
minute or two.

Lift the meatballs from the sauce with a slotted spoon and set on a
warm platter.  If the sauce is too thin for your taste, boil
vigorously over high heat until reduced to desired consistency. Pour
over the meatballs and serve, topped with Parmesan cheese if desired.
