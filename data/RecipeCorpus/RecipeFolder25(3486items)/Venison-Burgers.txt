Title: Venison Burgers
Categories: Game, Burgers
Yield: 8 burgers
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
1 lb Ground venison
3 oz Pork fat back, ground
Because venison has so little fat, you'll need to add some for a juicy
burger. But don't use deer fat - it tastes bad.)

Mix venison, pork, salt and pepper, handling as little as possible.
Heat grill. Brush burgers with vegetable oil and grill about 4
minutes; turn and cook to desired doneness. Serve on rolls with your
choice of condiments. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   11-27-94
