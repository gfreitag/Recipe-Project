Yield: 1 loaf
1 t  Cinnamon
3 1/2 c  Bread flour
2 t  Yeast
1 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Broken walnuts
2/3 c  Water
1    Egg
2 T  Vegetable Oil

Add raisins and nuts at the beep.  NOTE:  I coated the raisins with
some of the flour and added them at the beginning and omitted the
nuts completely . This loaf rose to the full height of the bread pan
and was a nice slicer. Source: Donna German Bread Machine Cookbook V.
