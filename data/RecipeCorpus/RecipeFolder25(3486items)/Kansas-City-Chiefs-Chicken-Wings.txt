Buffalo chicken wings - also known here as K.C. Chiefs Chicken Wings -
originated at a bar in Buffalo, NY, and have become a well-loved
staple of the culinary snacking scene, especially at game time or the
renowned Happy Hour at the local bar.

Straying from the usual preparation, I've lightened this recipe,
using a lot less oil than is usually called for. You can add more or
less Tabasco sauce, according to your own taste. The typical blue
cheese dipping sauce is lightened with nonfat yogurt, and it's hard
to stop eating once the carrot and celery sticks come out.

1. Place the cheese, yogurt and mayonnaise in a bowl and mix together,
mashing the cheese well with the back of a spoon to make a dipping
sauce. Remove to a serving bowl and refrigerate until time to serve.

2. Cut the celery and carrots into long, thin sticks. Reserve.

3. Preheat oven to 450'F.

4. Separate the chicken wings at the joint with a sharp knife so that
you have sections resembling a drumstick and a thigh. Place the wing
pieces in a large bowl with the oil, Tabasco sauce, paprika and salt.
Toss well. (See note below on preparation in advance.)

5. Place the wings on a baking sheet and bake for about 20 minutes or
until they are browned and cooked through, shaking the pan once or
twice.

6. To serve, arrange the wings on a decorative platter and serve with
the dipping sauce and vegetables alongside.

Per serving (three wings with sauce): 408 calories, 30 grams fat, 90
milligrams cholesterol.

NOTE: When preparing the wings, cut off the tips and reserve for
another use, such as making chicken broth. For deeper flavor, prepare
the wings a day in advance, cover and marinate overnight in the
fridge. To keep celery and carrot sticks crisp if prepared a day
ahead, refrigerate, covered, in a container filled with water and
place on the shelf closest to the crisper drawers. The dipping sauce
also can be made a day in advance. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI
