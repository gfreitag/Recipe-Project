Title: Duck Breasts in Lingonberries and Red Wine
Categories: Poultry, Main dish, Game
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Chicken broth
1/2 c  Lingonberries
2 tb Red wine
3    Whole duck breasts; boned
-(about 1/3 to 1 lb each)
Coarse salt & pepper to tast
1/2 ts Olive oil
1. On a work surface, cut duck breasts in half lengthwise. Trim any
extra fat and skin from around the meat on each breast. With a sharp
knife, score the skin 3 times diagonally without piercing the meat.
Sprinkle all over with Salt and Pepper.

2. Brush 1 large or 2 medium sized non-stick skillets with olive oil.
Place the breasts, skin side down, in the skillet over high heat.
Saut, pressing down on the breasts with the back of a spatula, until
they are well browned, about 5 to 6 minutes. Turn and brown the
second side for about 3 to 4 minutes, for rare meat. If the pan gets
too hot, reduce the heat to meduum. Remove the breasts to a plate and
cover to keep warm until serving. Pour off the fat and repeat with
the remaining breast.

3. Discard all the fat in the pan and wipe it out with a paper towel.
Place the skillet over medium heat; add broth along with any duck
juices that accumulated in the plate. Boil for 1 minute, reduce heat
to medium and stir in the lingonberries and wine. Cook for about 7
minutes or until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally.

4. To serve, slice the warm duck breasts thinly on the diagonal. Fan
the slices out on a serving platter and spoon the warm sauce over the
top. Serve immediately.
