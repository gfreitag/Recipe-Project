Title: Individual Pizza Crust
Categories: Pizza, Pasta, Bread, Information
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Olive oil
1/2 c  Cornmeal
Light vegetable oil cooking
- spray
3/4 c  - lukewarm water
1 ts Honey
1 tb Dry active yeast
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Semolina
Mix the water and honey together in a medium stainless steel bowl.
Sprinkle the yeast on top and set it aside for about 20 minutes to
proof, until bubbles form on the surface.

Put the flour, semolina, and salt into the bowl fo a food processor.
Turn the machine on and slowly add the yeast mixture through the feed
tube. Process fro about a minute, until a dough ball forms, drizzling
a little additional water into the feed tube if necessary.  Continue
to process for another 2 minutes.

Rub the surface of a large bowl with the olive oil.  Transfer the
dough ball to the bowl and roll it in the oil to coat.  Cover with a
towel and set the bowl aside in a warm place until the dough has
doubled in size, aobut 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 400Ã¸.

Remove the dough to a work surface that has been dusted with the
cornmeal and roll out evenly to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.  Cut
out eight 5 1/2-inch circles, using a sharp knife and a saucer of
that circumference.

Spray a cookie sheet 3 times with the vegetable oil to coat and put
the pizza rounds onto the sheet.  Bake for 3 to 5 minutes, until
golden. Remove the baked crusts from the oven and add the topping
variation of your choice. No longer limited to the realm of sausage
and mounds of fatty cheese, today's light pizzas please the palate
with an array of sophisticated flavor combinations. Consider the
three variations that follow as departure points, knowing that you
can mix and match ingredients guiltlessly according to whim.  Oprah
