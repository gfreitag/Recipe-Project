Indian-style paneer (panir), also known as Queso Blanco in Latin
America, is very easy. You just warm 5 cups milk to about 195
(stirring to prevent scorching.) Throw in 2.5 tbs. fresh lemon juice
++ and watch the fun while it curdles for 10 or so minutes! Using
good cheesecloth in a colander, tie it into a bundle and hang it over
your sink for a few hours or overnight.

Then put the bundle on a flat surface, and place a heavy weight on
it. I use a big cast iron pot with rocks on top! A cutting board and
bricks would work, too. The idea is to smash it down to about 5/8"
thick. I take some pieces of 5/8" wood and place them around under
the edge of the pot or cutting board so that when it gets to that
thickness, it stops further smashing. This takes 3 or 4 hours. Now
you're done. You can fry it or brown it and use it in whatever
recipe, and it keeps pretty well wrapped in plastic in the 'fridge
for a few days.
