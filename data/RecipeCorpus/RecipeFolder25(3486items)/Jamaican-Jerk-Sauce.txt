Title: Jamaican Jerk Sauce
Categories: Caribbean, Can/preserv, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea TB ground Thyme, or 2 TB
-thyme leaves
2 bn Scallions
1 t  Cinnamon
1/2 t  Nutmeg
Soy sauce to moisten (2 TBS)
1/2 c  Ground Allspice
1/2 c  Brown Sugar
6 ea - 8 Garlic cloves
4 ea - 6 Scotch Bonnet Peppers
-(or equivalent) seeds and
-all
Put everything in a food processor and blend until smooth. You may use
allspice berries, if available, but use enough to give the equivalent
of 1/2 cup ground. This will keep "forever" in the refrigerator. Feel
free to increase the garlic, and the hot peppers. I do. The recipe,
double, and triples very well. Rub about 1/4 cup sauce into each
chicken, halved, and get under the skin and in all the cavities. It
is is pork, use a de-boned shoulder, score the fat, and rub the sauce
in, using 1/2 cup, or more, per 6 lb shoulder. Use less for fish.
Marinate, preferably overnight, and grill over a low fire, until
done. Charcoal is ideal. The meat will be a smoky pink when done, and
the skin nice and dark. Chop the meat into pieces, and serve
traditionally with a hard-dough bread, and LOTS of Red Stripe Beer!
