2 tb Sugar
1 c  Milk
1 1/2 c  Shelled pinons
1 c  All purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
MMMMM-------------------BLUE CORNMEAL HOTCAKES------------------------
1 c  Milk

Prickly Pear Syrup
Peach Honey
1 1/2 c  Blue cornmeal

For the pinon hotcakes, grind the pinons to a coarse meal in a
blender. Mix the ground nut meal toghether with the flour, salt, and
sugar, and add the milk to form a stiff batter.  Ser aside and let
stand 1 hour before cooking.

In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, baking powder, and salt for
the Blue Cornmeal Hotcakes.  Add the butter, then eggs and milk,
mixing thoroughly.

Warm a griddle over medium heat and lightly brush with the butter.

Drop spoonfulls of the batters on to the griddle.  The Pinon Hotcakes
may have to be pressed with a well-greased spatula into 1/4 to 1/2
inch thick cakes, 3 inches in diameter, because the batter is very
thick. Turn the cakes once as they begin to brown.  To keep the
finished hotcakes warm, stack them on a cookie sheet, cover them with
a clean towel, and place them in the oven set at a very low heat.
Butter the griddle between each batch.

Serve with the Prickly Pear Syrup and Peach Honey.

Makes 35 to 40 hotcakes.
