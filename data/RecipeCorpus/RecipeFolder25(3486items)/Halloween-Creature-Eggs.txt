Title: Halloween Creature Eggs
Categories: Holiday, Fruit, Appetizer
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM-------------------FROM:  SHELLEY RODGERS------------------------
-and 1/3 cup of the syrup
6 ea Or 12 canned peach halves
(OR for small creature eggs, use apricot halves instead and double
up) 1/2 cup orange-flavored liqueur, such as Cointreau, optional 1
cup whipping cream 2 tsp powdered sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla Put
peaches/apricots, cut side down, and syrup in an 8-inch square pan.
Add liqueur; cover and chill 6 hours or up to overnight. With an
electric mixer, whip cream, sugar and vanilla until cream holds soft
peaks. Spoon 1/6 of the cream onto each of 6 salad plates and spread
out to form a disk about 4 inches across for 'egg whites'. With
slotted spoon, lift peaches/apricots from syrup and arrange 1 peach
or 2 apricots ('double yolks'), round side up, in the center of cream
on each plate to make 'yolks'.  Pour syrup into a small pitcher and
offer to pour onto individual portions.  Makes 6 servings. My notes:
this is *especially* effective if black plates are used. They really
look like sunny-side-up eggs!  And the Cointreau adds a delightful
taste sensation. [ Sunset magazine, Oct 1986]
