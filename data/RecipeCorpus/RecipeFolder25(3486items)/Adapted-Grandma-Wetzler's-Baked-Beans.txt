ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS) In a large pot, saute the bacon over medium
heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the diced onions, and cook
until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the water, sugar, molasses,
ketchup, mustard and bring to a boil. Add the beans and bring back up
to a boil, then reduce to a slow simmer and cook 4-5 hours until the
beans are soft, adding water from time to time if necessary and
stirring often to prevent burning.  Season with salt and pepper to
taste. These beans will keep, covered and refrigerated about one
week. From "Thrill of the Grill" by Chris Schlessinger and John
