Title: Arkansalsa
Categories: Soup/stew, Tex/mexican, Condiment, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 cups
1    Tomatoe peeled and seeded
1 x  Juice of 1 lemon
1 T  Finely minced fresh parsley
2 T  Finely minced fresh cilantro
1/4 t  Salt
1 lg Onion, peeled
1/2    Green bell pepper,
Stemmed and seeded
1 x  Fresh red and green chili
Peppers to taste
Dice all the ingredients through the tomato into pieces a bit
bigger than the head of a wooden kitchen match;  the smallness and
uniformity of the pieces are important here.  Toss all together with
the lemon, herbs, and salt -- the consistency should be more relishy
than sucelike
