Title: Fava Bean Soup Procaccini
Categories: Soup/stew, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 6 servings
1    (19 ounce) can fava beans
1/2 c  Arugula
1/2 c  Mustard greens
1 lb Roma tomatoes, peeled and
Sieved
Black pepper to taste
--BOUQUET GARNI----
6    Whole cloves
12    Black peppercorns
2    Bay leaves, crushed
1    Sprig of rosemary, crushed
1 t  Extral light olive oil with
A dash of sesame oil
8 oz Sweet onions (I prefer
Walla Walla), peeled and
Cut in 1/2 inch cubes
2 lg Garlic cloves, peeled and
Thinly sliced
1/2 c  Thinly sliced bulb fennel
1    (6 ounce) can no-salt
Tomato paste
1 qt Water
ß Heat the olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat.  Fry the
onions and garlic until soft.  Add half the fennel, the tomato paste
and the water.  Stir and bring to a boil.

ß Drop in the bouquet garni and fava beans.  Cook for 30 minutes

ß Drop arugula and mustard greens in boiling water and blanch for 30
seconds.  Plunge immediately into cold water to refresh.  Set aside.

ß Slice the arugula and mustard greens and add them to the soup.  At
the last minute, add the remaining fennel and the fresh tomato puree.
Season the pepper to taste.

ß Remember to remove the bouquet garni before serving the soup... it
could get nasty if a wide mouthed, talkative guest swallowed it!
