Categories: Ground beef, Beef, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
-plus fat to make 2 tb
2 tb Flour
1 1/2 c  ;water
2 pk Oxo or bovril dry beef gran
5    Mushrooms, sliced *
Salt, pepper to
Taste
1 lb Lean ground beef OR
-ground turkey
4    Green onions, minced
1 tb Flour
1 pk Oxo dry beef granules
1 ds Worcestershire sauce
-Gravy Pan juices,
*  sauteed in butter (or a small can of mushrooms, drained)

Mix ingredients together Form into 4 oval patties (for the two of you,
freeze half the patties for a future meal)

Melt 2 tbsp butter in a frying pan.  Fry patties in the butter until
done to your liking.  Remove from pan and keep warm, while you make
gravy.

Gravy: Add the flour to the drippings in the frying pan. Cook,
stirring, until the drippings turn brown (about the color of peanut
butter). Be careful to to let them burn. Add dry oxo or bovril powder
blend, add cold water to the hot drippings, and stir until smooth.
Add mushrooms, and season to taste.(I added a dash of maggi and some
browning as well as a sprinkle of powdered onion hp) Pour over meat.

My mother also would sometimes make a cream gravy instead of a brown
gravy for this (just substitute milk for the beef broth). Original
