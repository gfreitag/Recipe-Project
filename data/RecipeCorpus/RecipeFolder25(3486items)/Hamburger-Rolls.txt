Yield: 8 servings
1    ABM Bread Recipe
Make regular or packaged Bread Recipe using Knead and First Rise.
Stop the machine at this point and take out the dough.

Place dough on lightly floured board and expel gases.

Form dough into a 12" length and cut into 8 even pieces. Place on
greased cookie sheet.  (I use Spray Pam or whatever I happen to have
on hand) Do not use Teflon as it tends to burn the bottoms. Flatten
with the palm of your hand.  Cover with a cloth and let rise until
double the size in a warm oven for about 1/2 hour.

Bake in a 400 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.

Carolyn's notes:  These are delicious.  Once you have perfected them
you will never buy a store bought hamburger roll again.
