Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday, European
Yield: 1 servings
1/8 t  Salt
2 c  All purpose flour
2 t  Ground cinnamon
2 t  Unsweetened cocoa powder
2 ea Sticks (1 cup) unsalted
-butter, softened
1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 T  Beaten egg
In a bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter with the sugar
until the mixture is light and fluffy, add the egg and the salt, and
beat the mixture until it is combined well.  Sift the flour into the
bowl and beat the dough until it is just combined.  Transfer half the
dough to a small bowl, stir the cinnamon into 1 of the dough halves,
and stir the cocoa powder into the other half.  Transfer each dough
to a large pastry bag fitted with a 1/2 inch plain tip.  On lightly
buttered baking sheets pipe 5 dots of either the cinnamon or the
cocoa dough in circles, 1 inch apart, and pipe a dot of the
contrasting dough into the centers, forming flower shapes. Bake the
cookies in batches in the middle of a preheated 350 F. oven for 15 to
18 minutes, or until they are pale golden, transfer them to racks,
and let them cool.  Makes about 60 cookies. From: Gourmet/ December
