Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
5 T  Milk
1 t  Cinnamon
1 t  Soda
ds Salt
1 c  Shortening, melted
3 c  Oats
2 c  Flour
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Raisins
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine shortening, oats, flour, sugar,
raisins, milk, cinnamon, soda and salt.  It should stick together
when you squeeze a small amount in your hand.  Drop small amounts on
sheet. Bake 10 minutes. Hope you try them, they are the best I've
ever tasted, though I'm probably biased.
