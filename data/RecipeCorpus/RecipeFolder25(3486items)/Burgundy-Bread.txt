Title: Burgundy Bread
Categories: Bread, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Garlic, minced
1 lb Bread, French, quartered
1/2 c  Oil, olive
1 c  Wine, red, dry
Put a half cup of oil in a small sauce pan with the cup of red
wine. Add the garlic and stir over medium heat bringing it all to a
boil to eliminate the alcohol.  When heated thoroughly, the mixture
is done.

Take a loaf of French bread and slice it lengthwise in half so
you have a top half and a bottom half.  Then take the two halves and
slice them in half again vertically so that you have four pieces
altogether. (two tops and two bottoms)

Use a brush to paint your French bread pieces with the liquid
mixture (generously).  Broil the pieces of bread about 6" from a
broiler (liquid painted side up) for about 5 minutes and serve.

If it's going to be a little while before you can serve the
bread, you can wrap it in foil and keep it warm.
