Categories: Italian, Pasta, Crab/shrimp
Yield: 1 servings
3 ea Cloves garlic
1 lb Peeled raw shrimp
1 t  Red pepper
1 t  Salt
-ea
1 c  Margarine or butter
1/4 c  Fresh parsley
4    -8
1 lb Linguini noodles
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 T  Salt
Peel shrimp and set aside. Saute 4-8 cloves of garlic in butter for 10
minutes in a small skillet. Set garlic butter aside.  Put 1/4 cup
olive oil, 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp red pepper, and 1/4 cup fresh
parsley in blender and blend for 10 seconds. Pour olive oil mixture
into a large heavy skilled and set aside.  Boil linguini with 1 tbsp
salt. Drain linguini well and put back in the pot. Pour garlic butter
over noodles and toss gently. Place olive oil mixture over high heat.
Add the shrimp and 1 tsp of salt to the mixture and cook over high
heat 3-5 minutes until the shrimp are pink. Serve shrimp over the
garlic butter noodles. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese. We like fresh
ground pepper on this.  We've also tried crumbling Feta cheese on top
instead of the parmesan and found it rich and tasty. We like Italian
bread and salad w\ this.
