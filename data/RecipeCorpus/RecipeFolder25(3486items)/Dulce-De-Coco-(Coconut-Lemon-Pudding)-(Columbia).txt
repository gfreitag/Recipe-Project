Categories: So. america, Dessert, Pudding
Yield: 4 servings
;1 cup
1 1/2 c  Sugar
5    Cloves, whole
2    Egg yolks
2 tb Lemon juice, fresh
1/2 c  Boiling water
1/3 c  Raisins
1    Coconut; fresh and freshly

;enough cold water to make
Pour 1/2 cup of boiling water over the raisins and let them soak
for at least 10 minutes.  Meanwhile in a 2 to 3 quart enameled or
stainless steel saucepan, combine the coconut milk mixture, sugar and
cloves, and bring it to a boil over high heat, stirring only until
the sugar dissolves. Reduce the heat to moderate and cook, uncovered
and undisturbed, until the syrup reaches a temperature of 230 degrees
(F) on a candy thermometer or a few drops added to ice water form a
thread. Stir the grated coconut into the syrup, lower the heat and
simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Beat the egg yolks with a fork, whisk or rotary beater for a minute
or two, until they thicken.  Beat into them 2 or 3 tablespoons of the
simmering coconut mixture, then slowly pour the eggs into the pan,
stirring all the while.  Still stirring, simmer the mixture for 5
minutes, but under no circumstances allow it to come to a boil.
Remove the pan from the heat, pick out the cloves, and add the
thoroughly drained raisins and lemon juice.  Transfer the pudding to
a bowl and let it come to room temperature. Then refrigerate until
completely chilled. Serve either from the bowl or in individual
dessert dishes.
