Title: Monkey Bread 2
Categories: Bread
Yield: 1 loaf
1 pk Dry yeast
3 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Margarine, melted
1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Margarine, quartered
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
Combine milk, 1/2 cup margarine, sugar, and salt in a saucepan; heat
until margarine melts.  Cool to 105 - 115 degrees; add yeast,
stirring until dissolved.  Place flour in a large bowl; add milk
mixture and stir until well blended.  Cover and let rise in a warm
place (85 degrees) for about one hour and 20 minutes or until doubled
in bulk.

Roll into 1 1/2 inch balls; dip each in melted margarine.  Layer the
balls of dough in a 10 inch one piece tube pan or bundt pan.  Cover
and let rise again until doubled in bulk (about 45 minutes).

Bake at 375 degrees for 35 minutes.  Cool in pan five minutes; then
invert onto serving plate.

Personal Note - wanting to have cinnamon monkey bread, after rolling
the dough in the butter, roll in a mixture of cinnamon and sugar - to
your taste then place in pan.
