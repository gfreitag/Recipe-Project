To Carve a Whole Ham
Yield: 1 info

Most country hams are sold whole and require a special carving
technique. Since, they remain very salty even after cooking, try to
keep the slices as thin as possible.

1. Use a thin-bladed, flexible carving knife, and cut down
perpendicular to the bone. Remove a wedge-shaped piece at a 45-degree
angle.

2. Carve thin slices right down to the bone. Twist the knife slightly
when it hits the bone to release each slice.

3. Decrease the carving angle in order to obtain slices of uniform
thickness.

4. Turn the ham over and carve lengthwise now, thinly slicing the
remaining meat.

To Carve a Half-Ham

Wet-cured hams ÄÄ such as those sold in supermarkets ÄÄ are usually
only a portion of the leg, and are easy to slice. Generally speaking,
slices should be about one-quarter-inch thick. Again, use a sharp
thin-bladed, flexible carving knife.

1. Holding the knife perpendicular to the bone, carve full slices
until you reach the bone. Then cut half-slices.

2. Cut parallel to the leg bone to release the slices. Turn the ham
over and carve half-slices in the same fashion.
