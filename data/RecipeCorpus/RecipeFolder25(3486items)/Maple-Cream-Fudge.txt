Title: Maple Cream Fudge
Categories: Holiday, Candy
Yield: 2 servings
1 c  Thin cream or evaporated
-milk
1/4 c  Butter
1 t  Vanilla
4 c  Lightly packed brown sugar
2 T  Flour
2 t  Baking powder
1/8 t  Salt
Grease a 8x8" pan with butter for the finished fudge. Lightly oil a
large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. In it combine the brown sugar, flour,
baking powder, salt and cream. Bring to the boiling point over medium
heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Continue cooking until the
mixture reaches the soft ball stage (240F.), stirring only enough to
prevent scorching. Remove from the heat and add the butter. Then
without stirring, cool until lukewarm (110F.). Add the vanilla and
beat until the mixture is thick and loses its gloss. Pour into pan
and score into small squares when almost cool. If the fudge becomes
too stiff before it is poured into pan, knead it until it softens,
then press it into the pan or shape it into a roll and slice. If it
doesn't set, stir in 1/4 cup milk. Reheat to given temperature. Beat
it again until it reaches the right consistency. Yields 36 pieces.
