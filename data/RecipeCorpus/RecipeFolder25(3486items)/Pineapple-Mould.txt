Mix 300ml cream, egg yolks, cornflour and pineapple juice in a
saucepan and simmer over low heat, beating until the mixture has
thickened.  Do not allow it to boil or it will curdle and separate.
Set aside to cool.

Soak the gelatine leaves in cold water for 10 mins to soften.  Cut the
pineapple slices into pieces, saving a few for the garnish.

Beat the remaining cream and set aside.  Beat the egg whites until
they form soft peaks.  Strain the gelatine leaves and melt over low
heat.

Stir the pineapple pieces and whipped cream into the egg yolk
mixture. Add the melted gelatine in a fine stream and mix well.  Fold
in the egg whites.

Rinse a dish or mould with cold water.  Pour in the mixture and chill
in the fridge for at least 2-3 hours until firm.

Dip the dish in hot water and turn the pudding out on to a serving
plate. Garnish with pineapple slices, grapes or strawberries.
