Title: Mezgaldi of Onions
Categories: Appetizer, Moroccan, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Black peppercorns, crushed
4 tb Cinnamon
2 tb Sugar
2 ea Celery stalks
2 lb Spanish onions, sliced
2/3 c  Olive oil
1/4 ts Powdered saffron
1 ts Ginger
Arrange onions in layers in a large shallow bowl.  Combine oil,
saffron, ginger, pepper, half cinnamon & sugar.  Pour over onions,
add just enough water to cover.  Mix well & let marinate for 2 hours.

Place celery stalks crossways in the bottom of a tagine or casserole.
This protects the onions from scorching.  Arrange onions in
overlapping layers & pour over marinade.  Sprinkle with remaining
cinnamon & sugar.

Cover tagine & cook at 325F for 30 to 40 minutes & then uncover &
brown under a broiler just before serving.  The onions should be
lsightly caramelized & very tender.
