Yield: 4 servings
4 ea Slices swiss cheese
4 ea Slices ham
2 ea Can chicken gravy
2 c  Broccoli florets
2 c  Stuffing mix
4 ea Chicken breast halves
Steam broccoli.  Moisten stuffing mix.  Combine broccoli & stuffing.
(Added notes: Do not steam broccoli more than about 2 min.  Steam in

Farm stuffing mix.) Put chicken breasts in baking dish, sprinkle with
pepper. Top chicken with cheese slice, then ham slice, then stuffing
mix. Cover and micro on medium-high (70%) 15 minutes, rotating dish
three times. Uncover, top with chicken gravy, microcook on high to
