Title: Cornsicles with Shrimp and Oregano
Categories: Native amer, Vegetable, Crab/shrimp
Yield: 2 dozen
1 ts Dried oregano
12 md Shrimp, peeled, deveined and
-diced
24    Popsicle sticks
6    Ears corn
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts White pepper
1 tb Chopped fresh oregano OR
Trim the corn and remove the husks and silk.  Save and wash the larger
husks.  Cut the corn kernels from the cob, scraping out as much milk
as you can.

Grind the kernels using a meat grinder with a sharp blade. (A food
processor can be used, but be sure to stir the corn well before
continuing.) Add the salt, white pepper, oregano, and shrimp, and mix
well.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Drop a tablespoon of the corn mixture onto the center of a clean
husk. Fold the left side of the husk into the center, then the right,
and then fold the bottom end upward.  Push a popsicle stick 2 to 3
inches into the open end and pinch the husk around the stick with
your fingers. Tear a thin strand from a dry hisk and tie it around
the cornsicle.

Place the rolls, sticks in the air and very close together, in a glass
baking dish or a loaf pan.  Bake 30 minutes, until the corn mixture
is firm and solid.

To eat a cornsicle, peel off the corn husk and eat it hot from the
stick, as you would a popsicle. ***********

Traditionally, this recipe is made with blue corn alone; the sweet,
fresh taste needs no embellishment.  However to enhance the flavor of
commercial sweet yellow corn, I have added shrimp and oregano,
resulting in a wonderful appetizer or accompaniment.
