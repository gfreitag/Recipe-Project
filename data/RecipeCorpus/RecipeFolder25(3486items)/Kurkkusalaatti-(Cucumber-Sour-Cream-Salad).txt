the tines of a fork, score the peel lengthwise.  Sice into rounds, as
thin as you can.  Sprinkle with the tablespoon of salt and toss in a
colander. Let the cucumbers stand and drain at room temperature for

dry in a clean tea towel. (They will be almost transparent)

Combine the remaining ingredients and fold into the cucumbers.  Chill
well before serving.  Garnish with a sprig of dill.
