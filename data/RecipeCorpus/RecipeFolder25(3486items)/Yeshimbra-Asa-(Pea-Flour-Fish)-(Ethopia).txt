Title: Yeshimbra Asa (Pea Flour Fish) (Ethopia)
Categories: Appetizer, African, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1/3 c  Berbere
2 c  Chick pea flour*
Oil for frying
1/2 c  Onions or shallots, chopped
2 tb Cayenne
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Oil
In a dry, heavy pot, stir the onions over low heat until browned. Add
1/3 c water along with the cayenne, salt & oil.  Simmer for 5 to 10
minutes & then add another 2/3 c water & the berbere.  Bring to a
boil, cover & reduce heat, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, add just enough water to the pea flour to make a thick
dough similar to that for rolled cookies.  Try using 1/2 c water &
add extra a teaspoonful at a time until the mixture adheres to itself
to form a ball. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a
thickness of a 1/4" & cut into shapes with a cookie cutter.
Ethiopians make fish shapes & decorate them with all sorts of designs.

Fry the pieces in moderately hot oil in a heavy skillet for 3 to 4
minutes, turning several times.  When they are crisp & brown,
cautiously spoon them into the sauce in the pot.  Simmer gently for 5
or 6 minutes, being careful not to break the shapes.  Lift pieces out
with a slotted spoon & drain on cloths.  Serve with the sauce.

* Also called gram or garbanzo flour, it is easily found in Asian
foodstores.

The Ethiopian Coptic Church still uses the ancient fish sign as a
symbol for Chrisitanity.  These flour fish are traditional during
Lent when fasting rules require no animal products maybe consumed.
