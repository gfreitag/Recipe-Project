Title: Herbed Turkey Breast
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Turkey, Sthrn/livng
Yield: 10 servings
1    Turkey breast, bone-in;
-(5 to 6 lbs.)
1/4 c  Oil, olive
3    Garlic cloves; minced
1 ts Rosemary, dried
Combine first 3 ingredients.  Gently loosen skin on turkey.  Brush
about one-third of olive oil mixture under skin; replace skin.  Place
in a lightly greased 11x7x1-1/2" baking dish; cover with foil.

Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour.  Uncover and bake 1 hour or until a
meat thermometer reads 170 degrees, basting with remaining olive oil
mixture every 15 minutes.

NOTE: A few drops of a browning-and-seasoning sauce, such as Kitchen
Bouquet, added to the olive oil mixture helps the turkey get an even,
golden color.
