Title: Roasted Garlic with Cumin-Eggplant & Capellini
Categories: Salad, Middle east, Pasta
Yield: 4 servings
-- lengthwise
2 ts Cumin
12 oz Capellini
Juice of 1/2 lemon
2 ts Cilantro, chopped
3 ea Garlic heads, broken into
-- cloves but unpeeled
4 tb Olive oil
Salt & cayenne
1 ea Eggplant, thinly sliced
Place whole, unpeeled garlic cloves on a baking sheet in a single
layer & sprinkle with 2 tb olive oil & salt to taste.  Roast at 350F
for 30 minutes.  Raise the heat to 400F & continue to roast for
another 10 minutes.  Remove from oven & cool.  When cool enough to
handle, peel & toss with the remnants of the oil they were cooked in.
Set aside.

Brush eggplant slices with rest of olive oil & sprinkle with 1 ts
cumin. Broil until the eggplant is browned in spots & tender, cut
into matchstick pieces.

Cook pasta to al dente & drain.

Toss pasta with the eggplant & garlic flesh.  Season with salt,
cayenne, rest of cumin & the lemon juice.  Let cool to room
temperature & serve, garnished with cilantro.

** Recipe was confusing, it omitted ingredients in the directions
that are included in the ingredient list & referred to ingredients
that did not appear in the ingredient list.  So, this recipe has
hopefully been adjusted so that it works.
