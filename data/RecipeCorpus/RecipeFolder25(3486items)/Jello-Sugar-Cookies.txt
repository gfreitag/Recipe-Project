Cream  butter or margarine with  regular gelatin mix  (not necessarily
Jello brand) and  vanilla , add  egg and  milk, beat until light and
fluffy, add   flour, baking powder and salt blend well. Drop from
spoon onto greased cookie sheet, bake at 375 degrees F. For 8 to 10
minutes, watch first batch to get right time baking just until edges
are brown. Remove carefully to towel or wire rack to cool. Don't let
sit they stick badly!! If you put soft butter, JELLO (works best),
vanilla, egg, and milk together in one bowl, dry in another children
can mix and add until well mixed, my 4 year old loves to make "green
globs" and for Christmas they are simple
