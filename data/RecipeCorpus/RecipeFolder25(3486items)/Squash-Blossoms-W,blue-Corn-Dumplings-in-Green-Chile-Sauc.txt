Categories: Native amer, Vegetable, Pasta, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Green chile sauce
18    Blue Corn Dumplings
18    Male squash blossoms
Prepare the Blue Corn Dumplings and allow to cool.  Gently rinse the
sqyash blossoms in cold water, remove the stamens, and stuff each
blossom with 1 cooked dumpling. Blace the blossoms in a steamer over
just enough water to reach the bottom of the steamer, about 1 inch.
Bring to a boil over high heat, cover, and steam the stuffed blossoms
3 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat the Green Chile Sauce.  Spoon about 1/3 cup of the
Green Chile Sauce onto each plate and place 3 stuffed squash blossoms
on top. Serve immediately. ********

The Green Chile Sauce in this recipe adds just enough zest to enliven
the mellow sweetness of the dumplings, creating an unusual appetizer.

*** NOTE *** Male squash blossoms are those that do not bear fruit.
