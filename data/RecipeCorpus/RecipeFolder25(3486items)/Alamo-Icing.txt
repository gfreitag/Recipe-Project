Title: Alamo Icing
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Margarine
1/4 c  Milk
2 c  White sugar
2 ea Egg yolks
1/2 t  Vanilla
Using the small bowl on your electric mixer, cream the margarine and
the sugar together.  Add the egg yolks, milk, and vanilla.  Mix on
slow speed until thoroughly blended.  Slowly turn up speed to high
and let'er rip for 12 minutes!!  Refrigerate until needed.  It will
seem a might thin, but once it has sat in the fridge for a while it
will be a good consistency for frosting.  I got this recipe from a
lady who works out a restaurant south of town called the Alamo.  They
use it for all their home made carrot cakes.  If you don't have any
cream cheese, this is a great icing to use instead of. Origin: Sharon
