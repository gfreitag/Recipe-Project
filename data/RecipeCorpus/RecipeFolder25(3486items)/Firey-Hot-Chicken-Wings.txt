:14 These screaming hot chicken wings are easy to prepare, and can be
made hot, hotter and scorching hot by adding more hot sauce. Enjoy
these wings with celery sticks and Cool Cucumber Dip to help
extinguish any "fires."

NOTE:  The recipe actually calls for 3 to 5 Tbsp of Louisiana hot
sauce. Use your own discretion.

Set oven to "broil" and place rack 6" from the element. In a medium
sized mixing bowl combine hot sauce, oil, vinegar and garlic powder.
Place chicken wings on a broiling pan. Using a pastry brush, coat the
wings with the sauce mixture.  Broil the wings for 7 minutes on one
side before turning them over and broiling for another 7 minutes.

You can also cook these wings over the BBQ.  Cook wings for the same
amount of time over medium high heat. Be sure to preheat the BBQ and
brush the grill with oil to prevent sticking.

Serves 2 - 4
