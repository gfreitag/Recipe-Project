Source: The National Culinary Review, June'94 Not all flowers are
edible. Some delicious looking plants are poisonous, and eating them
could lead to serious illness or death. For instance, there are 60
commercial varieties of pansies, and only three that are specifically
for eating. Choose flowers only from edible plants or those listed in
a reliable source. Flowers also should be eaten only in the amounts
specified in recipes. Persons who are prone to allergies can have an
allergic reaction to flowers, as to any food.  Proceed with caution
when trying unfamiliar flowers. If you have any doubt about the
identity of a flower, do not eat it. Your best bet is to use flowers
commercially grown especially for eating. Linda Beaulieu. Submitted
