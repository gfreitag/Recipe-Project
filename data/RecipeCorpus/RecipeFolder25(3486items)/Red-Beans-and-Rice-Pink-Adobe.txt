Categories: Main dish, Cajun/creol, Beans, Sausage, Meat
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Tabasco sauce
1 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 ts Dried thyme
1 1/2 lb Meaty ham hock
3 c  Cooked white rice
1/4 c  Chopped onion
1/2 lb Sausage,cooked and sliced
4 c  Dry red beans
2 tb Bacon fat
1 ea Onion,chopped
2 c  Canned tomato sauce
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
1 tb Vinegar
Clean and wash beans. Soak in a large pot overnight. When ready to
cook, drain off water. In a heavy 4-quart pot or dutch oven, heat the
bacon fat. Saute onions until wilted. Add the beans, tomato sauce,
salt, pepper, vinegar, Tabasco, red pepper, and thyme. Add enough
water to cover the beans. Simmer until beans are semi-cooked, about
30 minutes. Remove 1 cup of beans and drain. Mash in processor or
blender. Return mashed beans to pot along with ham hock and cook over
low heat for 2 hours, until the mixture is creamy, stirring
occasionally. (The beans should be creamy and juicy. Toward the end
of cooking time, if the beans seem to dry, add a little broth or
tomato juice.) When done, remove ham hock. Remove meat from hock and
return meat to the pot. Stir to mix. Evenly divide the rice into 6
individual serving bowls. Spoon the beans over the rice. Garnish with
chopped onion, Tabasco sauce, and cooked sausage slices. Serve with
French bread. From: The Pink Adobe Cookbook by, Rosalea Murphy Typed
