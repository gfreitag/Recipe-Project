Title: Jack-In-The Box Tacos (Ts)
Categories: Tex/mexican, Ground beef, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
-mild taco sauce
12 ea Soft corn tortillas
3 c  Crisco cooking oil
6 sl American cheese
1 ea Head finely chopped lettuce
1 lb Ground beef
1/3 c  Refried beans
1/4 t  Salt
2 T  Chili powder
1/4 c  Orgeta or Pico Pica brand
Slowly brown the ground beef over low heat, using a wooden spoon to
chop and stir the meat, keeping it very fine and smooth. When the
beef is brown, drain the fat.  Add the refried beans and use the
wooden spoon to smash the whole beans into the mixture, creating a
smooth texture. Add the salt, chili powder, and 2 Tbsp. of the taco
sauce to the mixture. Remove from the heat. In another skillet, heat
1/4" of oil until hot. (Test with a small piece of tortilla - it
should bubble when dropped into the oil.) Crisco oil will give the
food a taste closest to the original. Spread 1/12 of the beef mixture
on the center of each corn tortilla. Fold the tortillas over and
press so that the beef filling acts as an adhesive and holds the
sides together.  Drop each taco into the pan of hot oil and fry on
both sides until crispy.  When cooked, remove the tacos from the oil
and place them on a rack or some paper towels until they are a little
cooler. Pry open each taco slightly.  Add 1/2 slice of American
cheese (cut diagonally) and some lettuce.  Top with about 1 1/2 tsp.
of the remaining taco sauce. Note: Try to use very thin tortillas for
this recipe so that they won't crack when you fold the filled tacos
in half before frying. It's best to use warm tortillas and even
moisten them along the middle where you will be folding, for
additional flexibility. Makes: 12 tacos From: "Top Secret Recipes"
