Categories: Dressing, Salad, Caribbean, Crab/shrimp
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 tb Fresh lime juice
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
1 lb Shrimp, shelled (and
-deveined, if desired)
1/2 c  Fresh cilantro, cleaned
-and coarsely chopped
1 lg Red bell pepper
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Olive oil
3    Garlic cloves,finely chopped
1    Jalapeno pepper,fine chopped
2 tb Chopped fresh ginger root
1 1/2 t  Cumin powder (or to taste)
1 1/2 t  Sugar
Cut the bell pepper into 4 slices, cutting from the top to the bottom
of the pepper. Discard the inner ribs and seeds. Very lightly coat
the skin of the slices with about 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.
Broil under a hot broiler for 5 minutes, until the slices begin to
blacken slightly. Cut the slices into 1/2" strips. Set aside.

Blanch the snow peas in boiling water for 3 minutes, until slightly
tender. Rinse in cold water. Set aside.

In a saute pan or skillet, saute the garlic, jalapeno and ginger in 1
tablespoon of olive oil for 2 minutes, or until the garlic starts to
color. Transfer the mixture to a small bowl with a slotted utensil,
leaving as mush oil in the pan as possible. To the bowl, add the
cumin, sugar, lime juice, salt, pepper and the remaining 1/2 cup
olive oil. Stir vigorously to mix. Set the dressing aside.

Reheat the saute pan until it is almost smoking hot. Toss the shrimp
in the pan, and cook briefly on each side, until pink (about 15-20
seconds on each side). If your pan is not big enough to hold all of
the shrimp in one layer, then cook the shrimp in batches.

Combine the shrimp, snowpeas, pepper slices, dressing and cilantro,
and toss gently. Serve immediately, or refrigerate and serve later.
