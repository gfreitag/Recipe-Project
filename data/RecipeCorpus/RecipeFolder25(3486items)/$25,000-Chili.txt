Dice and saute first 5 ingredients.  Add meat and brown. Add
everything else, including 1/2 can beer. (Drink the remainder,
according to Annie). Add water JUST TO COVER TOP. Cook about 3 hours
on low heat. Stir often. Remove bay leaves. Couple of notes: Better
the 2nd day, if you can wait that long. Also, those I substitute pure
New Mexico ground red chili. Whatever you use make sure it's pure
chili powder, no additional seasonings added.
