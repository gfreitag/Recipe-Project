Potatoes: =========

Cook the potatoes in enough water to cover with the 2
tablespoons of vinegar added to the water.  Cook until tender.  The
vinegar keeps the potatoes firm.

round cake pan) and add the cooked bacon and drippings.  Toss the
potatoes and bacon together.

Add the rest of the ingredients: salt, pepper, and celery seed.
Add the onions and parsley. Dressing: =========

Whisk the eggs in a sauce pan.  Add the mustard and whisk.  Add
the sugar and whisk.  Add the cider vinegar and whisk.

Turn the heat up to get the mixture to a boil.  When it begins to
boil, reduce the heat and whisk and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes.
Pour the dressing over the potatoes, toss, and cover with plastic
wrap, stirring occasionally, for three hours while the potatoes
absorb the sauce.
