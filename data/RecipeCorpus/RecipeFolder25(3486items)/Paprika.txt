Title: Paprika: Sweet Vs Hot
Categories: Information, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 info  Although we now associate paprika with Hungarian cooking, this bright
red spice is native to the New World and was brought to Europe by
Columbus. The dried and powdered form of a red pepper called Capsicum
annum, paprika was introduced in Hungary during the sixteenth
century. Until the nineteenth century, the spice was always hot. At
that time, Hungarian spice millers developed a process to remove the
seeds and veins of the fiery red peppers. Since most of a pepper's
heat is concentrated in the seeds and veins, the resulting paprika
was "sweet". The intensity of the paprika could be controlled by
removing some or all of the veins and seeds.

In recent years, much sweet paprika has been made from a mild red
pepper hybrid that can be ground whole with the seeds and veins. Most
of the sweet paprika sold in this country comes from this new pepper
grown in Spain and California. However, for paprika ÄÄ either sweet
or hot ÄÄ with superior flavor and character, look for brands
imported from Hungary.
