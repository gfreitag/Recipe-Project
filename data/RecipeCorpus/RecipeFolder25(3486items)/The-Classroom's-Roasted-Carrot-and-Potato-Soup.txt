Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetable, Potato
Yield: 10 servings
1 qt Chicken stock
1 pt Heavy cream
Salt to taste
Pepper, fresh cracked, to
-taste
3 lb Idaho potatoes
1 lb Carrots
6 ea Garlic cloves
3 ea Celery ribs
1 md Onion
1/2 c  Melted butter
Peel and roughly cut patotoes, carrots, garlic, celery, and
onion; place them in a roasting pan.  Coat with butter, salt and
pepper to taste, then mix thoroughly.
Roast in 400 degree oven until vegetables brown slightly, about
30 to 45 minutes, depending on oven.  Reduce temperature to 325
degrees and roast until tender, about one half hour more.  Stir
frequently to prevent scorching.
Remove from oven and puree vegetables and jucies in a food
processor. (The mixture was very thick, so you might add some of the
stock to smooth it).  Place the puree in a soup kettle and add
remaining chicken stock. Bring to a simmer, then add heavy cream,
salt and pepper to taste. Stir often to prevent burning.
