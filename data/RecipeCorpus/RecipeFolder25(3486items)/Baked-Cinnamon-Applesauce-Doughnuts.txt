and any remaining scraps of dough; reroll to 1/2 inch thickness and
cut as before. Place doughnuts on baking sheets coated with cooking
spray; brush 2 tablespoons melted margarine over doughnuts. Let rise,
uncovered, in a warm, draft-free place for 40 minutes. Combine 1/2
cup sugar and 1 teaspoon in a large zip-top heavy-duty plastic bag,
and set aside. Bake doughnuts at 425 degrees for 8 minutes or until
