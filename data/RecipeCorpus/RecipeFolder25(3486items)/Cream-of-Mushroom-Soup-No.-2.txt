Mushroom soup is so readily available in cans that it seldom occurs
to the cook to make it from scratch. The canned product is, in fact,
so universal, reliable, and chameleon-like in flavor that it has
become the base of a thousand casseroles. If you seek a more intense
mushroom flavor, however, look no further. Erid Lie, tooting his own
horn, claims to have the answer to your prayers right here. Flour
plays a part in the thickening of this soup, but the basic body and
emphatic statement of mushroom flavor come from cooking part of the
mushrooms with onions until they are mellow and lightly browned, then
pureeing them. The flavor is further enhanced by adding sliced
mushrooms before the final heating. 1. Chop half the mushrooms;
thinly slice the remaining mushrooms and set aside. 2. Melt butter in
a 5-6 quart pan over medium-high heat; add chopped mushrooms, onion,
and thyme. Stir often until the vegetables are lightly browned, 15-20
minutes. Mix flour with vegetables. 3. Pour into a blender or food
processor; whirl, adding as much broth as needed to get the mixture
smoothly pureed. Pour mixture back into pan; add remaining broth,
sliced mushrooms, bay leaf, and cream. 4. Bring soup to a boil on
high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low and simmer to
blend flavors, about 10 minutes. Add sherry, salt, and pepper to
taste. Make about 8 cups.
