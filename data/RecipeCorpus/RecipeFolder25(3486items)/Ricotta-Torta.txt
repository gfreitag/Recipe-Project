MMMMM----------------HERE'S THE RICOTTA TORTA REC---------------------
1/2 lb Cream cheese
1/2 c  Half & Half
1 T  Rum or brandy
1/2 T  Vanilla
1/2 c  Assorted candied fruits
Recipe for 2 crust pie
4 ea Eggs
1/2 t  Salt
1 c  Powdered sugar
3 T  Cornstarach
1 1/2 lb Ricotta cheese
Beat eggs until light and add 1/2 t. salt and 1 c. Powdered sugar,
adding one tablespoon at a time and continuing to beat
uniterruptedly. This is best done in an electric blender. Add 3 T.
cornstarch, beating until the mixture is smooth and thick. Force the
ricotta cheese through a fine sieve. Combine with softened cream
cheese and beat in 1/2 c. half and half, adding this cheese mixture
to egg mixture while beating continuously. The success of this torta
lies in the thorough beating. Flavor with 1 T. brandy or rum. Mix
thoroughtly, then fold in 1/2 c. chopped assorted candied fruit. Pour
into pie shell. Cover with second pie pastry and flute. BAke in
preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn off the heat and allow the cake to
remain in the oven with the door clossed for 3/4 of an hour. Let
cool, but DO NOT REFRIGERATE before serving. Decorate the top with
candied fruit, and powdered sugar. This sounds almost like a conolli
in a crust dosen't it. This is my first try at sending a recipe hope
it's ok.
