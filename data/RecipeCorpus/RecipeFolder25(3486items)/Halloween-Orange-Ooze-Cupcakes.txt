Preheat oven to 350F.  Line cupcake baking pans with paper cupcake
liners.

In small mixing bowl, use electric mixer to combine cream cheese, egg
and sugar.  Blend in 2 drops yellow food coloring and 1 drop red food
coloring, adding more coloring if necessary to reach desired shade.

vanilla.  Add contents of small mixing bowl to large mixing bowl and

cupcake batter, then place 1 teaspoon filling at center of each.  As
cupcake bakes, the batter will rise to surround the filling.

Wearing oven mitts, place cupcake pans in oven; bake approximately 25
minutes or until cupcakes test done.

When done, wear oven mitts to remove pan from oven and turn off oven.

If desired, frost with orange icing--or just let the orange filling
ooze out as a surprise.
