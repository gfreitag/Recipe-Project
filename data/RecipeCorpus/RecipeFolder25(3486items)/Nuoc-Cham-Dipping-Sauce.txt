2    Cloves garlic
2    Fresh chile peppers,
-preferably Serrano
This sauce truly defines Vietnamese cuisine. It goes well with deep
fried, roasted and grilled foods. [Amen! S.C.]

In a mortar, pound the garlic, chile pepper and sugar into a paste.
(Or blend in a food processor or blender.) [It's better in a mortar.
Trust me... S.C.] Transfer mixture to a bowl and add fish sauce, lime
juice and water; stir to blend. Allow mixture to sit for 5 minutes or
until ready to serve. Strain mixture into dipping saucers. [Not me--I
prefer a chunky texture. S.C.]

Makes about 3/4 cup.
