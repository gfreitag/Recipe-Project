Categories: Dessert, Pudding
Yield: 6 servings
1 l  (1 3/4 pints) milk
1    Vanilla pod
6    Egg whites
175 g  (6oz) sugar
1 ts Vanilla sugar
MMMMM--------------------------CUSTARD-------------------------------
30 g  (1oz) unsalted butter
8    Egg yolks
150 g  (5oz) icing sugar
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
1 ts Water
2 tb Caster sugar
To Drink: - Sweet white wine

Level of Difficulty:  Fairly difficult Preparation Time: 2 hours
Prepare in Advance:  Partly
Beat the egg whites.  When the eggs have started to thicken, add half
the sugar.  Beat until they form stiff peaks.  Beat in the remaining
sugar and the vanilla sugar.  Continue beating until the mixture is
very firm, stiff and shiny.

Pour the milk into a large saucepan.  Cut the vanilla pod in half and
scrape out the seeds with a sharp knife.  Add the seeds and the pod
to the milk and bring to the boil.

Scoop up balls of meringue mixture with a large spoon and poach them
in simmering milk.  Simmer for a few mins until the meringue balls
have risen and stiffened slightly.  Remove them with a perforated
spoon and set aside to cool.  Reserve 500ml/17 fl oz of the milk.

Make the custard.  Beat the egg yolks with sugar.  Slowly pour over
the reserved milk, beating constantly.  Strain the sauce back into
the pan.

Return the pan to the heat and beat until the sauce has thickened.
Remove from the heat just before it boils and add the butter.
Continue beating until the sauce has cooled down.  Place in the
fridge.

To make the garnish, dissolve the sugar in the water over low heat.
Heat until a light brown caramel forms.

Pour the custard into deep plates, place a couple of 'islands' on top
and pipe a little of the caramel over them.
