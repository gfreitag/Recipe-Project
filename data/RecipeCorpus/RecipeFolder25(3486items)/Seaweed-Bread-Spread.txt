Title: Seaweed Bread Spread
Categories: Ancient, Bread, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings  Collect baskets of laver (a seaweed), avoiding sandy pieces.  Break up
large pieces, wash thoroughly in cold water and cook steadily for
about 4 hours in large pan of boiling water.  Check every 30 minutes
so it does not boil dry.

Done when sheets of laver have broken up into tiny pieces, forming
smooth puree.  Drain excess liquid and refrigerate (will keep fresh
about a week). Best served warm on fried bread garnished with bacon.
