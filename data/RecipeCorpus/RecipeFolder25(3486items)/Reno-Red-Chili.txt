Categories: Ground beef, Chili
Yield: 12 servings
1 tb Oregano; dried
1/2 c  Beer; warm
2 tb Paprika
2 tb Cider vinegar
3 c  Beef broth
4 oz Green chiles; diced
4 oz Stewed tomatoes
1 ts Hot pepper sauce
2 tb Corn flour (masa harina)
1 c  Cooking oil
3 lb Beef round; coarse grind
3 lb Beef chuck; coarse grind
Whole black peppercorns
12 tb Ground Red chile; mild
6 tb Cumin
6    Garlic cloves

6    Red chiles
Melt the suet or heat the cooking oil in a large heavy pot over
medium-high heat. Add the meat and the black pepper to taste, to the
pot. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook, stirring occasionally,
until the meat is evenly browned. Stir in the ground chile, cumin,
garlic, and onions. Add a small amount of water to barely cover.
Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30-45
minutes, adding water as necessary. Stir the crushed red chiles into
the meat mixture. Brew the oregano like tea in 1/2 cup warm beer
(room temperate). Strain the oregano-beer "tea" and stir the liquid
into the pot. Discard the oregano. Stir in the paprika, vinegar, 2
cups of beef broth, diced chiles, tomatoes, and hot pepper sauce.
Simmer, uncovered, for 30-45 minutes longer. Stir often. Dissolve the
masa flour in the remaining 1 cup of broth. Stir it into the pot and
simmer, uncovered, 1/2 longer.
