Title: Venison Jerky
Categories: Game, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
1 ea To 2 pounds raw lean
-venison strips
1/4 c  Cider vinegar
2 T  Brown sugar
1 t  Dried garlic powder
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
1/2 t  Ground pepper
4 T  Worcestershire sauce
1 t  Salt
Partially freeze meat so it can be cut easily into 1/4 inch strips.
Dump remaining ingredients in bowl or big cake pan and mix well.
Marinate meat in mixture covered in refrigerator for at least a day,
turning now and then to coat meat evenly. Shake excess moisture from
marinated strips. If oven is clean and you want to keep it that way,
line bottom with aluminum foil to catch drippings. Lay strips of meat
over cake racks or directly on oven racks. Or, to accommodate more
meat, use those spiked metal hooks used to hang curtains, spear a
strand of meat on each hook and hang down from regular oven racks.
(The more air that circulates around meat strips, the better.) Cook
for 5 to 6 hours in 175 degree oven. Remove from oven, blot with
paper towels and when cool, store in refrigerator in old mayonnaise
jars, with the tops on, or in sealed plastic bags. It will last for a
day or more without refrigeration. Most any barbecue marinades can be
used for jerky as long as they contain no oil. For stronger flavors,
add more seasonings and increase marinating time. Vinegar when added
to marinade, will soften the wild taste of game meats. Lean meats are
best for jerky. (Ann Beckmann Seattle PI)
