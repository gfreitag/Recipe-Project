Title: "Herman" Yeast Starter
Categories: Bread, Cake/cookie, Sourdough
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Salt
2 c  Warm water (105-115 F)
2 c  Flour
3 tb Sugar
1 pk Active dry yeast
In large bowl mix flour, sugar, yeast and salt.  Gradually stir in the
water; beat or whisk until smooth.  Cover with towel;  set in warm
(80 - 80 deg F) draft-free place - the kitchen or other warm room in
summer or in cold weather on top of insulated furnace or radiator, on
a buffer such as a folded heavy towel or pillow.  Stir 2 or 3 times a
day for about 3 days or until starter is bubbly an produces a yeasty
aroma. Transfer to larger bowl, large jar or plastic container. Cover
partially (tilt lid or punch holes in plastic cover); refrigerate.
Makes about 1-1/2 to 2 cups starter, depending on thickness. It can
be creamy or as thick as dough because of room conditions, the age of
"Herman" and other variables. *Note about "Herman"* Herman is a
"cultured" dough you add to new dough to give it distinctive flavor
or texture it otherwise wouldn't have. But unlike other starters that
require constant feeding, stirring and using, this one doesn't make a
slave of you. You replentish "Herman" only after you use it. And if
it's longer than 14 days, put it in the freezer until you're ready.
The flavor of this starter evolves as it ages- mildly sweet when
young, more like sourdough when older. Care and Feeding of "Herman"
The starter should be used within 14 days and replenished or fed
immediately after each use.  To feed starter, stir or whisk in 1 cup
each flour and milk and 1/2 cup sugar;  misture need not be
completely smooth. Wait at least 24 hours before using again.  If you
do not plan to use the starter within 14 days, cover tight and
freeze. Freezing slows down the fermentation, so let stand at room
temperature several hours or till thawed and bubbly before reusing.
