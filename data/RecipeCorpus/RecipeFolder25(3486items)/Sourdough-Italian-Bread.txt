Title: Sourdough Italian Bread
Categories: Bread, Italian
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Plus 1 tsp. grated Romano
-or Parmesan cheese
1/2 t  Salt
1/2 t  Black pepper (coarse)
4 ea To 5 cups flour
1 t  Sesame seed
1 1/4 c  Starter
1 t  Salt
1 c  Lukewarm water
1 1/2 c  Flour
2 ea Cakes or packages yeast
1 1/3 c  Lukewarm water
Early in the morning combine the starter, 1 tsp.  salt, 1 cup lukewarm
water and 1-1/2 cups flour.  Beat to blend thoroughly.  Cover with a
clean towel and set aside for approximately 5 hours.  If the sponge
has to set for a little longer or shorter period of time, it won't be
hurt. When ready to finish the dough, stir the sponge down.  Dissolve
the yeast in the lukewarm water and add to the sponge.  Now stir in
the next 4 ingredients in the order given, adding 4 cups flour first,
and then using the other cup of flour if needed.  Turn the dough out
onto a lightly floured breadboard and knead thoroughly, about 7 to 10
minutes. Then return the dough to a buttered bowl, cover with a clean
towel, and set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.  When
doubled, punch the dough down and set aside, covered, for another 1/2
hour. Now turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board again, and
divide into 6 pieces of dough. Roll and stretch each piece of dough
into a long rope. Braid 3 of the ropes together for each loaf.  Tuck
the ends under, and lift each braid into a buttered glass loaf pan.
Cover and set aside to rise until doubled again, about 1 hour. Brush
loaves with melted butter and sprinkle each loaf with a mixture of 1
tsp. each sesame seed and grated Romano or Parmesan cheese. Bake
loaves in 375 oven until browned and done, about 40 to 45 minutes.
