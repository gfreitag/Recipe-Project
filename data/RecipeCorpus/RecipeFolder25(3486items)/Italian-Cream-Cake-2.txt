NOTE: I am sorry for and confusion about of some measurements, but
this is how it was written down.  This is a very rich and good cake.
Most of the time I have seen it served was when the women wanted to
show off their cooking abilities.  This is one of those recipes that
everyone asks for, but few will share it with others.  I managed to
get it from my sister-in-law.
