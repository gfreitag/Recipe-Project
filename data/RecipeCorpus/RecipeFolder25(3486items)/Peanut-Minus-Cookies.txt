Even though this recipe from the Bread Shop in Chicago uses no refined
sugar, wheat flour, eggs or shortening, it surprised even the most
skeptical types.

1.  Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Have ungreased baking sheet(s) ready.

2.  Combine peanut butter, maple syrup and vanilla in a large bowl,
mixing until smooth. Add rice flour and salt; mix well. Fold in
peanuts.

3.  Form cookies, using 1 tablespoon dough for each. Place on cookie
sheet, spacing 1 inch apart. Flatten gently with the tines of a fork.
Bake until set, 11 to 12 minutes. Cool 1 minute on baking sheet then
transfer to a wire rack to cool.  Source:  Unknown.
