Categories: Ground beef, Fruit, Vegetable, Chilies, Stuffing
Yield: 4 cups
1 c  Small pimento-stuffed
-green olives (5 oz)
-thinly sliced
2 lg Garlic cloves; minced
1 1/2 ts Canela;
-pref freshly ground or
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/2 c  Sherry
1/2 c  Golden raisins
4    Long green fresh chilies
-like Anaheim or poblano or
4 oz Can peeled whole green
-chilies, drained
-finely chopped
1 1/2 ts Cumin seeds or
2 ts Ground cumin
1 lb Lean ground beef
1 c  Onions; finely chopped
(picadillo dulce)

1. In a small nonreactive saucepan, heat the sherry until hot. Add the
raisins and remove from the heat. Let sit for about 20 minutes.

2. If using fresh chilies, roast them directly over a gas flame or
under a broiler, as close to the heat as possible, turning
frequently, until charred all over. Transfer to a paper bag and let
steam for 10 minutes. Peel the chilies and discard the stems, seeds
and ribs. Finely chop the chilies.

3. If using cumin seeds, toast them in a small heavy skillet over
moderate heat, stirring until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a
small bowl.

4. Heat a large heavy skillet. Add the beef and 1/4 cup of water and
cook over moderate heat until the meat loses its pink color; about 2
minutes. Stir in the onions, olives, garlic, cumin, canela, cloves,
salt and pepper. Stir in the fresh or canned chilies and the raisins
with the sherry. Cook, stirring, until the onions are softened, about
5 minutes.

Note: Canela or true (Ceylon) cinnamon has a much subtler flavor than
the cinnamon, or cassia, commonly marketed in the U.S. so that you
can use about three times as much canela as cassia. To grind a soft
canela stick, use a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder.

Building Block: This slightly sweet ground-meat stuffing is seasoned
with one of the most popular spice combinations in Mexican cookin:
cumin, canela (true Ceylon cinnamon). and cloves.

Uses: Stuff the filling into sautÂ‚ed poblano chilies, marinated ancho
chilies or roast turkey. Use as a filling for tacos, burritos,
empanadas or croissants made with commercial puff pastry. Stir into a
simple tomato sauce.
