Here is my very favorite
-peanut brittle recipe...It
-is quick,
Easy, microwaved and I have
-never had it fail.
1 c  Peanuts
1 c  Sugar
Mix peanuts, sugar and salt in syrup in a rather deep glass dish that
can be used in the microwave. Cook on HI 4 minutes. Stir, then cook 4
more minutes on HI. (my microwave is 650 watts) Remove from oven and
add butter and vanilla. Stir and cook 2 more minutes on HI...Remove
and add baking soda. Stir and pour onto foil lined cookie sheet.
Spread it thin and when cooled break into pieces. (I prefer raw
peanuts for this as I don't like a lot of salt but some folks like
the canned salted ones best...It's just a matter of taste and won't
affect the recipe)

Peanut Brittle (Pat Stockett) I used this recipe one year and liked
it so well that I gave some out for gifts. I made some batches with
cashews. I don't own a candy thermometer. I found it foolproof. 1 c
sugar 1/2 c light corn syrup Dash of salt 1 to 1 1/2 c shelled raw
peanuts (I used unsalted roasted) 1 Tbsp butter 1 1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp vanilla Grease baking sheet heavily. Combine sugar, corn syrup
and salt in a 3-quart casserole. Stir in peanuts.  Microwave at HIGH
(100%) until light brown, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring once or twice.
Stir in remaining ingredients until light and foamy.  Quickly spread
on greased baking sheet. Spread as thin as possible for brittle
candy. Cool, break into pieces. Makes about 1 pound Sharp Carousel
