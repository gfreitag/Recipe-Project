Marinade: Combine the orange peel and liqueur and allow to marinate at
least an hour.

Truffles: Place the white chocolate in a heat-proof heavy bowl over
simmering water.  Stir with a wooden spoon until chocolate melts and
is smooth.

In another saucepan, bring the cream to a full boil, stirring often.
Pour the hot cream over the melted chocolate.  Stir until smooth.
Remove from heat.

When the chocolate cools a bit, add the liqueur, orange peel and
remaining liqueur.  Allow to cool to room temperature.

Line a baking sheet with foil or waxed paper.  By using 2 teaspoons,
shape the white chocolate into small balls.  Refrigerate until
perfectly chilled - an hour or so.

Coating: Melt the remaining 1 pound white chocolate over hot water.
Allow to cool slightly.

Using a dinner fork, submerge 1 truffle at a time into the chocolate.
Lift it carefully after it is well-covered by holding the truffle
over the chocolate to allow the excess coating to drip back into the
pan. You can gently tap the fork on the side of the pan to further
remove excess chocolate.  This helps to prevent a platform forming
under the finished truffle.  Refrigerate the truffles until perfectly
cold.

Arrange truffles in fluted silver or paper cups.  Store in a tight
tin box in single layers in the refrigerator.  They freeze well.

Yield: About 40 truffles.
