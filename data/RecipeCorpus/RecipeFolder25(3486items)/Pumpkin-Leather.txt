Title: Pumpkin Leather
Categories: Vegetable, Candy
Yield: 2 servings
Pumpkin pie spice to taste
4 c  Pureed pumpkin
Brown sugar to taste
Mix together the pumpkin, sugar, and spices.  Heat thoroughly and
cook for about 4-5 minutes, making sure that it is heated through
completely, the sugar is dissolved, and the spices are blended.
Allow to cool. Spread thickly on your leather tray, and dry.  Allow
sufficient time for it to become 'leathery' but not brittle.  (Mine
took over night) Peel off the tray, in strips if possible. Roll and
wrap each strip in plastic wrap, and store in Ziploc. **MY NOTES**
This comes out tasting like pumpkin pie, but sweeter.. almost a
candy. My kid thought this was great!! Almost devoured the whole darn
days work in one sitting!! 8-} Origin: Sharon Stevens Shared by:
