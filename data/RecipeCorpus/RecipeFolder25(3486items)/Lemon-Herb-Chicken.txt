This clever recipe uses the microwave to partially cook the chicken
before grilling it.

Arrange chicken, skin sides up and thickest parts to outside edges, in
rectangular microwavable dish, 11 x 7 X 1 1/2 inches. Shake remaining
ingredients in tightly covered container; pour over chicken. Turn
chicken to coat well. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours.

Prepare charcoal fire for grilling. Microwave chicken and marinade
tightly covered on high 8 to 10 minutes or until outside edges of
chicken begin to cook.

Place chicken, skin sides down, 5 to 6 inches from medium coals, on
grill; reserve marinade. Cover and grill chicken 10 minutes; turn
chicken. Cover and grill 10 to 15 minutes longer, brushing
occasionally with marinade, until done.
