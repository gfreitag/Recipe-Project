Title: Pesto Stuffed Mushrooms
Categories: Appetizer, Mushroom
Yield: 1 batch
1 lb Fresh mushrooms
Pimentos
1 c  Italian bread crumbs
1/2 c  Pesto
2 tb Prepared horseradish
Wash and stem the mushrooms and allow to dry.  Combine bread crumbs
and pesto; mix well.  Add horseradish and blend thoroughly.  Pack
each mushroom cap, mounding with the pesto mixture.

If serving cold, lay a small piece of pimento across top for color,
and serve.  If you'd like to serve them hot, omit the pimento; place
in a 350 F. oven and bake for 15 minutes.  Serve immediately.

The editors wrote:  "This is a great little appetizer before dinner
or at parties.  It's also a creative way to use all that fresh pesto
that tends to clutter the kitchen in summer."
