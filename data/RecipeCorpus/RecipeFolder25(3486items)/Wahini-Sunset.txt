Title: Wahini Sunset
Categories: Beverage, Fruit, Alcohol
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Dark rum
1 c  Ice
1    Pineapple, fresh, crushed
1 c  Papaya juice
1/2 c  Mango juice
Add all ingredients to a blender.  Mix at high speed until ice is well
chrushed.

Best served by two cute Wahinis at sunset on a sandy beach.

For the more adventuresome, you can also continue making them and
call it a Wahini Sunrise some 12 hours later.
