Title: Graham Kerr's Turkey Breast with Fresh Herbs
Categories: Poultry, Turkey, Main dish, Herbs/spice
Yield: 12 servings
2    Garlic cloves
-peeled and chopped
1/4 ts Freshly ground white pepper
1/8 ts Salt
1    4-lb. whole turkey breast
-boneless (with skin)
4    Fresh sage leaves
4    Fresh thyme sprigs
1 tb Fresh chopped parsley
Preheat oven to 325-degrees F.  Split the turkey breast, remove its
skin, and set skin aside.  Place sage, thyme, parsley, garlic,
pepper, and salt on one half of turkey breast, and place other half
on top. Put in a medium-size loaf pan, tucking reserved skin around
the breast to seal in juices.  Bake for approximately 2-1/3 hours
(the rule of thumb is 35 minutes per pound).  Poke the turkey with a
fork. When the juices run clear, turkey is done.

Serves 12.
