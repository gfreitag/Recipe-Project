Title: Poor Man's Lobster
Categories: Seafood, Fish, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Honey
2 lb Halibut
In large pot, boil enough water to cover halibut.  Cut halibut into
chunks. Stir honey into boiling water, then add halibut. When chunks
rise to the top, they are done.  We serve them just as you would
lobster (and they taste the same).
