Yield: 2 servings
MMMMM--------------------FROM: SUZZE TIERNAN-------------------------
They are too busy filling
-up (and I do mean FILLING
-up) with the gleasants.
1 ea Chicken (preferably a
-roaster)
1 ea Onion, cut up
Salt and pepper to taste
2 c  Flour
1/2 t  Salt
This is a family recipe,
-and of course over the
-holidays, they
Came into the conversation
-(they always do). I think
-it is a
German recipe. The chicken
-is secondary, no one cares
-to eat that
Boil chicken until tender with onion, salt and pepper. Combine flour
with the 1/2 tsp. salt and enough cold water to make a dough of
rollable consistency. Roll out thin on floured board and cut into 2
1/2 " squares. Remove chicken from broth, adding hot water if broth
is too thick.While broth is boiling drop in dough squares, stirring
as more are added. Turn down heat and let simmer 15 minutes
