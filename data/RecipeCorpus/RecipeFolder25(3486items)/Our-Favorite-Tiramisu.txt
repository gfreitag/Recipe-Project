DIRECTIONS
Cut cream cheese into pieces. Cool the espresso & water mixture. Cut
the pound cake into 3 1/2 x 1 x 1/2 inch strips. Finely chop
chocolate in processor. Set aside. Mix sugar and egg yolks in
processor 30 seconds. Add vanilla and process until pale yellow,
about 1 minute. Add cheese in batches and blend until smooth.
Transfer to medium bowl. Cover and chill 1 hour. Beat whipping cream
until stiff. Fold into cream cheese mixture. Cover and refrigerate
until well chilled, about 1 hour. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.)
Pour espresso into large shallow dish. Dip cake strips in espresso,
turning to coat all sides lightly. Arrange strips on bottom of 10 cup
shallow dish, smoothing with fingers to mold together. Sprinkle with
half of chocolate. Top with chilled cheese mixture. Sprinkle
remaining chocolate over. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours.
(Can be prepared 1 day ahead.) Tiramisu means "pick-me-up" in
Italian. Source: Bon Appetit From: Sallie Krebs
