We adore whole cranberry sauce in my home. In this recipe, fresh lime
and orange juices add just the right glow. When cooking the berries,
watch carefully and do not overcook them. For a clear sauce, be sure
to skim off and discard all the foam that comes to the surface. -

Combine all ingredients in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce
heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes, until berries pop open;
skim foam off surface. Cool to room temperature.
