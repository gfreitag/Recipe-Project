Happy holidays to everyone! Time to decorate the house for Christmas.
Have you ever used spray snow on windows and had a devil of a time
cleaning the stuff off after the holidays? I found a Recipe for
"window frost" in my mother's old recipe box and thought I would try
it. It worked great and cleans off very easyly. The solution dries
and forms a very nice frost/crystal pattern on glass. To make the
"frost" you will need: 1 cup beer 4 Tablespoons Epison salts

cello sponge(these are the pastel colored sponges that look like
puffed up paper and are hard when dry.) mix beer and epison salts
stir till all salt is dissolved. Dip one end of sponge in solution
leaving one end of the sponge dry and hard to use as
a"handle"."Paint" on solution very liberaly. As solution dries, frost
and crystal patterns will form. To clean frost off glass, use warm
water and glass cleaner.
