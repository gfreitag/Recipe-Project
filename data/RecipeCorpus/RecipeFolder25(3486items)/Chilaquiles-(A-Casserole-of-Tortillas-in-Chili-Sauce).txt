MMMMM-------------------------THE SAUCE------------------------------
12 ea Chiles guajillos
A griddle or comal
Heat the griddle and toast the chilies lightly on both sides.  Be
careful++ they burn very quickly.  When they are cool enough to
handle, remove the seeds and veins.  Cover the chiles with hot water
to cover and leave them to soak for about 20 minutes, then transfer
with a slotted spoon to the blender jar.  Add the rest of the
ingredients and blend to a smooth sauce. * 1/3 medium onion, roughly
chopped 2 cloves garlic, peeled 1/2 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. cumin seeds
1/2 cup chicken broth or water The Chilaquiles: A small frying pan 2
Tbsp. peanut or safflower oil 1/2 cup chicken broth Heat the oil and
cook the sauce until it darkens in color and is well seasoned++about
3 minutes.  Add the broth and let the sauce cook over a high flame
for a few minutes longer.  Set aside. Heat the oil and fry the
tortilla strips until they are a pale gold, but not too crisp. Remove
and drain on the toweling. Cover the bottom of the dish with one
third of the tortilla pieces. Cover them with a layer of one third of
the cheese and a layer of one third of the sauce. Repeat the layers
twice more. Add the 3 to 3-1/2 cups chicken broth and bring to a
boil.  Lower the flame and continue cooking the chilaquiles at a
brisk simmer, until most of the broth has been absorbed ++ about 15
mintues.  Add the epazote a minute or so before the chilaquiles have
finished cooking. (2 large sprigs.) Pour the sour cream around the
edge of the dish, then garnish with the chorizos and the onion rings.
Serve in small deep bowls with lime wedges on the side. From: The
