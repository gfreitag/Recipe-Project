Title: Crumpets 5
Categories: Bread
Yield: 25 servings
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 c  Milk
Metal rings
3 c  Flour
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water (110 F)
In large bowl, combine flour and yeast.  Add water; mix well.  Cover
with plastic wrap and let stand in warm place for about an hour,
until batter has doubled in bulk and is puffy.

Dissolve baking soda in milk and add to batter.  Stir vigorously until
batter is well mixed and runny.  Beating batter encourages desired
texture.

Preheat griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat.  Grease very
lightly. Grease metal rings and place them on griddle to warm.  Pour
about 2 tablespoons of batter into each ring.  Reduce heat to low and
cook gently for about 7 minutes until underside is brown and top is
covered with bubbles.  Carefully remove rings.  Set cooked crumpets
on a rack to cool. Regrease rings and repeat.

To serve, toast both sides of crumpets under broiler and offer with
butter and jam.

Note: while crumpet rings may be available at specialty stores,
English muffin rings or poached egg rings will work just as well)
