Categories: Soup/stew, Mushroom, Low-cal/fat, Beans
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts -Dried rosemary
32 oz Cannellini beans, canned
-- rinsed and drained
14 1/2 oz Vegetable broth (or more)
Chopped fresh rosemary
1 oz Dried porcini mushrooms
2 c  Hot water
1 tb Olive oil
1    Onion; chopped
1 3/4 ts Chopped fresh rosemary; OR..
Soak mushrooms in hot water in a medium bowl for 30 minutes.  Drain
well, reserving soaking liquid, and squeezing excess liquid from
mushrooms. Chop mushrooms.

Heat oil in a heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Saute
onion and 1-3/4 teaspoons rosemary in oil until onion is soft, about
5 minutes. Add mushrooms, and mushroom soaking liquid, being careful
to leave any sediment in bottom of bowl.  Boil until liquid is very
thick, about 8 minutes. Add cannellini and vegetable broth.  Simmer
until soup thickens, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Season
to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared to this point up to 1
day before serving, and stored covered in the refrigerator.  To
serve, bring soup to a simmer, adding more broth if soup is too
thick.) Garnish with a sprinkling of additional chopped rosemary.
