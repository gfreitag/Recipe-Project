Categories: Holiday, Cake/cookie, Chocolate
Yield: 1 servings
Green Food Coloring
12 sm Tootsie Rolls
1 ea New kitty litter box
1 ea New kitty litter box liner
1 ea New pooper scooper
1 ea Bx spice or German
-Chocolate Cake Mix
1 ea Bx white cake mix
1 ea Pk white sandwich cookies
1 ea Pk vanilla instant pudding
-mix
Prepare and bake cake mixes according to directions in any size of
pan. Prepare pudding and chill. Crumble cookies in small batches in
blender. Add a few drops of green food coloring to cup of the cookie
crumbs. Mix with a fork or shake in a jar. Set aside. When cakes are
at room temperature, crumble them into a large bowl. Toss with half
of the remaining cookie crumbs and enough of the pudding to make the
mixture feel moist, but not soggy. Place a liner in the box and pour
in mixture. Unwrap 3 Tootsie rolls and heat in a microwave until soft
and pliable. Shape blunt ends into slightly curved points (use your
imagination). Repeat with three more rolls.  Bury the rolls
decoratively in the cake mixture. Sprinkle the remaining white cookie
crumbs over mixture, then scatter green crumbs lightly over top.
Reserve 1 Tootsie Roll. Heat the rest, three at a time, in the
microwave until almost melted. Scrape them on top of the cake and
sprinkle with crumbs from box.  Heat remaining roll just until
pliable and hang it over the edge of the box. Place box on a sheet of
newspaper and serve with the scooper! I'm in a food science
department and someone just celebrated a birthday with this tasty
cake. I didn't have any myself, but it made a hit in the department.
Sounds great, huh? I don't know who to give the credit to for this
ingenious recipe, but I hope you enjoy (sounds like some work to me!)
