Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Gingerbread Girls And Boys
Categories: Diabetic, Cake/cookie
Yield: 3 dozen
MMMMM----------------------WET INGREDIENTS---------------------------
3    Eggs
2 t  Vanilla extract
1 1/2 c  Butter
1 1/2 c  Fruit sweetener
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1 T  Carob powder
2 t  Baking soda
2 t  Baking powder
3/4 t  Salt
6 c  White flour
3 T  Cinnamon
2 T  Ginger
1 T  Nutmeg
Cream together the butter and sweetener. When light and fluffy, add
the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the
vanilla. Sift the dry ingredients together three times and stir them
into the wet ingredients, mixing just enough to form a dough. Cover
the dough and refrigerate it for 20 minutes to make it easier to
handle before rolling out. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line the
baking sheets with baking paper. Roll the dough out to a 1/4 inch
thickness on a lightly floured surface. Dip the cookie cutters in
flour before cutting out gingerbread girls and boys or other shapes.
Place the cookies on the baking sheets, leaving 1/2 inch around each
cookie. Bake until a light golden brown, 15-16 minutes. Let the
cookies cool on the pans before removing. When the cookies are cool,
they may be fancifully decorated with an icing that will dry hard.
