Source: The National Culinary Review, June'94 Herb flowers work
particularly well here since they contain delicate flavor as well as
fragrance, color and texture.  By Christine Stamm, M.S., CWC,
assistant professor at the Johnson & Wales University, Providence,
R.I. 4 5-ounce salmon fillets Court bouillon, subtly flavored, as
needed 1/4 cup rice vinegar 1/2 cup olive oil 1 teaspoon chives,
freshly washed and chopped 1 tablespoon assorted edible flowers or
flower petals Dash caper juice Salt, as needed Ground black pepper,
as needed 16 pearl onions, peeled, washed and sliced thin 1 pound
asparagus, peeled, washed, blanched and sauteed Method: In a skillet,
heat olive oil over medium-high heat and lightly brown the onions;
set onions aside and reserve oil.  Combine flavored oil with rice
vinegar, chives, caper juice, seasoning and flavors. The vinaigrette
is especially nice when a tablespoon of court bouillon is added to it
before service. (Note: Do not make large batches of this vinaigrette
far in advance, since the flowers will not only fade in color, but
will lose all shape when saturated with vinaigrette). Poach salmon
and top with freshly warmed vinaigrette. Accompany with sauteed
asparagus and pearl onions.
