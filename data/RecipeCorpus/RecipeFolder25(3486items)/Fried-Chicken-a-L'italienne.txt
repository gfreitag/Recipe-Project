Title: Fried Chicken a L'italienne
Categories: Italian, Chicken, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Oil
Tomato Sauce
1    Chicken, cut into 8 pieces
Tomato Batter
1/4 c  Butter
Rather suspiciously, this dish was also know as fried chicken al la
Mexicaine. The old-fashioned tomato sauce does not taste much like the
tomato sauces we know today; it's tart and work better as a condiment
on the side than as a sauce to be poured over (though it is exactly
the sort of tomato sauce that was served on pasta 100 years ago).

Serve with peas and mashed potatoes. From "The Original White House
Cookbook" (1887), by Hugo Ziemann & Mrs. F.L. Gillette.

Dip chicken pieces in Tomato Batter. In large skillet melt butter
with oil. Add chicken pieces two at time and fry until brown (more
than two pieces at time can be fried as long as pieces are not
crowded). Serve, passing hot Tomato Sauce.
