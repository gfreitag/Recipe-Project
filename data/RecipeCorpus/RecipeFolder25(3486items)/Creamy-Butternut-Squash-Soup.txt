Title: Creamy Butternut Squash Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Raw almonds
1 1/2 ts Curry powder
1/2 ts Fine sea salt
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1    Butternut squash (1-3/4 lb)
-- skin left on,
-- cut into 2-inch cubes
4 1/2 c  Vegetable stock or bouillon
MMMMM------------------------FOR GARNISH-----------------------------
-- peeled, cored
-- and finely chopped
Parsley sprigs
1    Tart apple
-- (such as Granny Smith)
Put the squash and 3 cups of the vegetable stock in a large pot.
Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce the heat, cover and
cook until the squash is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the
heat, and let the squash cool in the cooking water.

Using a slotted spoon, remove the squash from the pot.  Peel the
squash, and set aside.  Set aside the pot of cooking liquid.

Blanch the almonds in boiling water for 30 seconds.  Drain, and
squeeze the almonds between your fingertips to remove the skins.
Compost or discard the skins.

Put the blanched almonds and the remaining 1-1/2 cups vegetable stock
into a blender.  Blend until smooth, about 1 minute.  Add the cooked
squash, curry, salt, and pepper and process until smooth.

Add the squash mixture to the pot of cooking liquid, and bring just
to a simmer over medium heat.

Serve hot, garnished with parsley sprigs and the apple.
