Canadian bacon gives a nice smoky flavor with a lot less fat (2 grams
per ounce) than regular bacon (13.8 grams).  This unusual soup is a
complete meal, which even includes a salad! 4 slices (2 oz) Canadian
bacon, cut in thin strips 1 quart skim milk 2 medium size potatoes,
peeled and cut in 1/2 inch chunks (2 cups) 1 cup chopped onion 1/2
tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper 3 tbsp all purpose flour 1 cup fresh,
frozen or canned corn kernels 4 cups coarsely shredded romaine or
other crisp lettuce 1 large ripe tomato, coarsely chopped (1-1/2 cups)

Cook bacon until lightly browned.  Add 3 cups milk, potatoes, onions,
salt and pepper, and bring up to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover and
simmer 5-7 minutes, until potatoes are tender.  Whisk 1/2 cup of the
remaining milk with the flour until blended.  Stir this mixture into
soup along with the remaining 1/2 cup milk and the corn.  Bring back
up to boil, then reduce heat once more to simmer.  Cook 2-3 minutes
or until slightly thickened. Add romaine lettuce and tomatoes and
cook for about 1 minute or just until lettuce is wilted.  Makes 8-1/2
cups, 4 servings. Per serving: 261 cal, 17 gr pro, 45 gr carbo, 2 gr
