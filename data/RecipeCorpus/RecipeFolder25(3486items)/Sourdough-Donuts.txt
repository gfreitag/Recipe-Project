Categories: Bread, Doughnut, Sourdough
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 t  Nutmeg
1 1/2 t  Baking soda
3 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 t  Cinnamon
2 t  Baking powder
1 t  Vanilla
1/4 c  Milk
1 c  Sourdough starter
2 ea Eggs, beaten
1/4 c  Oil
2/3 c  Sugar
1/2 t  Salt
Mix sourdough starter with soda in large bowl.  Add milk, sugar,
eggs, oil, flour, vanilla, baking powder and spices. Mix well, shape
into ball, place covered in refrigerator for two hours. Roll out onto
well floured surface to 1/2 inch thick.  Cut with biscuit cutter. Fry
in 350-375~f oil until golden brown, turning only once. Serve plain
or use any standard glaze or powdered sugar. You really can't eat
just one, so make two of three batches, one for the cook, one to
stash away for those "rainy days" which we're having right about now
and one for everyone else!!! Enjoy...these ARE yummy..... Posted by:
