1 c  Fresh bread crumbs
1 tb PLUS -see next ingredient-
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Dry vermouth
2 c  Crushed tomatoes
8 md Squid, about 6-7" long
1 cl Garlic, finely minced
1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
1/2 ts Oregano
1 ts Salt, or to taste
1 ts Coarse grind black pepper
To clean the squid: cut off the tentacles and reserve. Cut off and
discard the mouth which is in the center of the tentacles. Under cold
running water, peel off the outer skin and discard. Squeeze the body
to push out the insides, pulling off the head when the insides are
out. Pull out the center bone (it looks like a piece of clear
plastic) and discard. Turn the body inside out and rinse wll. Turn
back and rinse. Dry on paper towels. Chop the tentacles coarsley in
the food processor. Add the garlic, parsley, oregano, salt, and
peppre. Process until blended. Add the bread crumbs and one tb of the
oil. Mix well. Fill the bodies of the squid. Fill betwwen half and
three quarters full. If you over fill them they will burst when
cooking. Either skewer them closed or shut with toothicks or roughly
stitch with cotton thread and a needle. Heat remaining olive oil in a
skillet and add the squid. Turn often to prevent sticking. Cook until
lightly browned. Add the vermouth and saute until the wine has nearly
evaporated. Add the crushed tomatoes and simmer 20 minutes,
uncovered. Serve warm.
