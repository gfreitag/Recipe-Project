Title: Light Tomato Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Tomato
Yield: 2 1/2 cups
3    Garlic cloves; minced
Salt
1 pn Sugar (opt)
2 lb Ripe plum tomatoes
3 tb Lard or vegetable oil
1 c  Onions; finely chopped
(caldillo de tomate)

1. Heat a cast-iron griddle or a large heavy skillet until very hot.
Add the tomatoes and cook, t urning, until blackened and blistered
all over, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool slightly.

2. Working over a bowl to catch the juices, peel the tomatoes.
Squeezr them between your fingers to break into large chunks; do not
seed.

3. In a heavy medium nonreactive saucepan, heat the lard until very
hot but not smoking. Add the onions and garlic and cook over high
heat, stirring, for 1 minute. Lower the heat to moderate and cook,
stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and slightly
softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer
and cook for 5 minutes. Season with salt. If the sauce seems too
tangy, add the sugar. Remove from the heat and let cool.

4. Transfer the tomato sauce to a blender and puree. Strain the sauce
through a sieve set over a bowl, pressing against the solids with a
wooden spoon to force through as much of the puree as possible. The
sauce can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 3 days or frozen for up
to 1 month.

Note: you can enrich the sauce after it is made by sautÂ‚ing it in one
or two tablespoons of lard or butter just before using it.

Building Block: A good tomato sauce is crucial in Mexican cooking.
Roasting the tomatoes adds a smoky flavor to the sauce. You can also
season the sauce with chilies, herbs and spices (for example, bay
leaves, cloves, cumin or Mexican oregano)

Uses: Serve with stuffed poblanos or as a pasta sauce. Use as a
braising liquid for fish, poultry or meat (great with meatballs), as
the base of a stew or as you would any tomato sauce. Stir into soups
for added flavor.
