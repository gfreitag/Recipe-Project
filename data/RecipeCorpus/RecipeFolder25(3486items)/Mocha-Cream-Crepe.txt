MOCHA CREAM CREPES
1 ea 1-oz square unsweetened
-chocolate
1 1/4 c  Strong coffee
1/2 c  Half and half
9/12/90 ea

Place unwrapped chocolate square in a 4 cup glass measure. Microwave
on 50% (medium) for two minutes. Stir to complete melting. Add coffee
and half and half. Combine sugar and cornstarch. Using a whisk, blend
into chocolate mixture. WHisking midway through cooking, microwave on
high for four to five minutes or until mixture begins to thicken.
Blend a small amount of hot mixture into egg and return egg mixture
to hot mixture; whisk thoroughly. Microwave on high for two to three
minutes, or until mixture is thickened. Cool to room temperature.
Refrigerate until ready to assemble crepes. Yields 2 1/2 cups
filling. Prior to serving, place one quarter cup of mixture center of
each crepe. Roll and place seam side down on plate. Dust top with
powdered sugar. Makes 10 servings. * The paper dropped out the
quantity of half and half SOURCE the ingredients. The 1/2 cup is my
approximation based on consistency and yield. You might want to
experiment (probably with more) to perfect for your microwave.
