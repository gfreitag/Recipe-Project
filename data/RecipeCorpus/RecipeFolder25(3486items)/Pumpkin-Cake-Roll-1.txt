To beaten eggs, add sugar and beat until fluffy (2-3 minutes). Stir in
pumpkin and lemon juice. Add flour and spices, mix thoroughly. Pour
into greased and floured (or you may prefer to grease and line with
waxed paper, I do) jelly roll pan.  While baking, spread a dish towel
on flat surface and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Turn cake out onto towel and roll it up with towel. If you lined pan
with waxed paper, peel off of cake before rolling up.) Refrigerate
until cool. Cake is best when refrigerated over night. Bake at 350
for 10-15 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched.

Filling:  1 8oz Cream Cheese, 1 stick Margarine or Butter, 1 Teaspoon
Vanilla, 1 Cup Powdered Sugar.  Mix all together.  Unroll cooled cake
and spread with filling.  Reroll and refrigerate until ready to
serve. To serve, cut into thin slices.  (Nuts may be sprinkled on
filling before rolling up, I don't).
