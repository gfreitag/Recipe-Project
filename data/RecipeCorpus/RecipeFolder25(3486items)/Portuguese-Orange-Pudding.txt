First, glaze the dish or mould.  Melt the sugar in a frying-pan over
low heat, stirring constantly, until smooth and a light brown colour.
Pour in the boiling water and stir until the glaze is smooth.  Pour
into a slightly warmed savarin mould or into small individual dishes.
Turn the mould or dishes so that the mixture covers the base and
sides evenly. Preheat the oven to 200øC/400øF/Gas Mark 6.

Grate the rind of both oranges and squeeze out the juice.  Beat
together the eggs and sugar.  Add the grated orange rind and juice.
Pour the mixture into the mould or dishes and cover with foil.

Place the mould or dishes in a roasting tin half filled with hot
water and bake in the bottom of the oven for approximately 1 hour or
until the pudding is cooked.  Test with a knife.  Allow to cool.  Set
aside in the fridge to set fully.

Invert onto a serving dish and garnish with thin orange slices and
chopped orange rind or small bunches of redcurrants.
