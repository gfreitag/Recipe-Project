This is no ordinary pan of chicken livers to be eaten out of a sense
of economic or nutritional duty.  A splash of balsamic vinegar and a
sprinkle of sage complement the liver's gentle flavor.  Serve over
toast points or with baked sweet potatoes, accompanied by a spinach
salad. 1-1/2 lb chicken livers 1 onion, chopped 2 tbsp balsamic
vinegar or red wine vinegar 1 tsp crumbled dried sage 2 tbsp chopped
fresh parsley

Trim off fat and any connective tissue from livers.  In large
skillet, heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil over medium high heat.  Cook
livers, turning often, for 2 minutes.  Add onions, cook, stirring
occasionally for 2 minutes. Add balsamic vinegar, sage and 1/4 tsp
salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes of until
chicken livers are tender and slightly pink inside. With slotted
spoon, remove livers to platter. Add 1/2 cup water to pan. Boil,
stirring to scrape up brown bits, for 1 minute. Pour over livers.
