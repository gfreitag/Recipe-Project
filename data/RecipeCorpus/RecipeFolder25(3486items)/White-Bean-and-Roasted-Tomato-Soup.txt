Title: White Bean and Roasted Tomato Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Beans
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 tb Olive oil
1/4 c  Dry vermouth
1 tb Fresh sage *OR*
1 ts Dried sage
1/2 ts Sugar
Salt
Freshly ground black
1/2 c  Dried small white beans
3 c  Vegetable stock
1 1/2 ts Chopped fresh thyme *OR*
1/2 ts Dried thyme
2 lb Plum tomatoes, halved and
-seeded
5    Cloves garlic, minced
pepper

Place the beans in a medium sized saucepan with water to cover by
1-inch. Bring to a simmer over high heat.  Reduce heat to low and
cook for 2 minutes.  Cover, remove from heat and let stand for 1
hour. Drain, return beans to pan and add the vegetable stock and
thyme, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook
until beans are tender, 30 to 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Arrange tomato halves in a
single layer, cut side up, in a 9-X-13 baking dish.  Scatter garlic
over the top and drizzle with olive oil.  Bake the tomatoes for 1 1/4
to 1 1/2 hours, brushing occasionally with the pan juices, until the
tomatoes are shriveled and beginning to brown.  Let cool for 10
minutes. Slip off and discard skins.  Dice 6 of the tomato halves and
reserve.

Place the remaining tomatoes in a food processor or blender.  With a
slotted spoon, remove 3/4 cup of the beans and add them to the blender
along with a little bean cooking liquid.  Puree until smooth.
Transfer the puree to the saucepan with the beans and add the
reserved diced tomatoes, vermouth, sage and sugar.  Bring go a simmer
and cook for 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish
with fresh sage leaves. Submitted By DAVE HALLIDAY   On   10-21-94
