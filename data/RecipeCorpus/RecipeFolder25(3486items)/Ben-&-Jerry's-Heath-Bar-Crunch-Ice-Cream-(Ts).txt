Chunky ice cream creations
Freeze the candy bars.  Beat the eggs by hand until fluffy. Slowly
beat in the sugar.  Add the cream, half-and-half, and vanilla and mix
well. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze. While the
ice cream is freezing, place the frozen candy bars in a plastic bag
and break them into small pieces with a knife handle.  When the ice
cream is done, remove it from the ice cream maker and add the candy
pieces. Mix well with a large spoon and store in the freezer. Note:
It's important to get the right consistency of Heath bar chunks. Most
of the candy bar should be crushed into crumbs, but stop breaking the
candy when there are still several 1 1/2" chunks remaining.  Try
substituting other ingredients for the Heath bar chunks such as
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Oreo cookies, Kit Kat bars, Rollo cups,
M&M's and chunks of raw cookie dough. Makes: 1 quart From: "Top
