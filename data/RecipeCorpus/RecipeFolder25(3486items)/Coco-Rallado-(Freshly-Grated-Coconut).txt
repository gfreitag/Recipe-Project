Title: Coco Rallado (Freshly Grated Coconut)
Categories: So. america, Dessert
Yield: 3 cups
1    Coconut, fresh; about 2 lbs.
Note: When buying a coconut, shake it to make sure it is full of
milk!

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees (F).  Puncture 2 of the 3 smooth,
dark eyes of the coconut by hammering the sharp tip of an ice pick or
screw driver through them.  Drain all of the coconut milk into a
measuring cup. there should be about 1/2 cup.  Set the milk aside.
Bake the empty coconut in the oven for 15 minutes, then transfer it
to a chopping block.  While the coconut is hot, split the shell with
a hammer. The shell should fall away from the meat; if it doesn't,
cut off any bits still clinging to the shell.  Pare off the brown
outer skin of the coconut meat with a swivel blade peeler or small,
sharp knife, and cut the coconut meat into 1 inch pieces.  Place
these in the jar of a blender with 1/2 cup of coconut milk, and blend
them at high speed for 1 minute, or until finely grated.
(Alternately, grate the coconut by hand, piece by piece, through a
hand grater, and stir in 1/2 cup of coconut milk.
