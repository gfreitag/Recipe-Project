whites until foaming.  Whip the cream.

Squeeze the gelatine leaves and melt them in a little water over low
heat. Allow to cool slightly.  Stir the gelatine in the egg yolk
mixture.  Stir in the lemon rind and juice.  Mix in the whipped cream

the mould. Garnish with fruit such as strawberries, grapes, or thin
orange slices and whipped cream.
