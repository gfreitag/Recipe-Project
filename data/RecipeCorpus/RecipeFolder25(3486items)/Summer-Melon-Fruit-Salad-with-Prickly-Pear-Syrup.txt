1/4    Yellow watermelon (if not
Cut the muskmelon or cantaloupe in half and scoop out the seeds.
Scoop the melon into 1-inch balls and place in a bowl.  Cut the
peaches in half, or with larger peaches, cut into slices.  Add to the
melon balls. Trim the cactus pad, cut into strips, and blanch in
boiling salted water 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Rinse the pads under
cool water to remove their gum; drain well.  Toss together with the
fruits.

Slice the watermelon in 1/2 inch slices, and from each slice cut 1
1/2 inch triangles, removing the seeds as you cut. (I have found that
when you slice watermelon into pieces this size it is easier to make
sure there are no seeds left)  Toss the watermelon with the other
fruit.

Garnish with wild mint and serve with Prickly Pear Syrup
************************

Several varieties of melon grown in the Southwest are enjoyed by
Native Americans inthe late summer during cultural ceremonies and
festivals. This recipe is cool and refreshing and a particular
favorite of mine.
