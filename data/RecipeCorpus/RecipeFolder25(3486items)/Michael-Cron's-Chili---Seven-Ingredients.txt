1 lg Onion, minced
2 tb Minced garlic
4 c  Brown stock
1 1/2 lb Lean beef, cut 1/8" cubes

Combine the chili powder and salt in a bowl, pour beer over mix, and
set aside. Heat 1/4 cup of olive oil in a sufficiently-sized saute
pan until it smokes. Add beef, using a fork to break up any pieces
which stick together. Cook, strring occasionally, over high heat
until meat is well sered (but not burnt). Add onions and garlic,
reduce heat, cook until onions are translucent. If meat has been
seared in small batches, add all meat, onions and garlic to a
stockpot. Add beer/spice mixture to pot. Cook until liquid is well
reduced (be careful not to scorch). After liquid has reduced, add 2
cups of stock. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered for
2 hours. Use remaining stock to adjust consistency during cooking.
