Title: La Peche Pumpkin Custard
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Dessert
Yield: 1 batch
2 ts Pumpkin pie spice
6    Eggs
8 oz Cream cheese; room temp.
2 c  Half-and-half; scalded
14 oz Sweetened condensed milk
3/4 c  Plus 1/3 cup sugar; divided
3 tb ;Boiling water
1/3 c  Cognac
-- preferably Courvoisier
1 c  Cooked pumpkin; pureed
-- (may use canned)
Heat oven to 350 F.  Put a one-piece tube pan in the oven.  (The pan
should not have a removable bottom.  An ideal measure is 9" across
the bottom and 10" across the top.)

Put 3/4 cup sugar into a skillet over low heat until it melts and
turns brown.  Once the sugar is melted, carefully add boiling water
and stir to dissolve the sugar.  Pour into heated tube pan.  Holding
pan with potholders, tilt it to coat bottom and sides, then set aside.

Thoroughly mix remaining 1/3 cup sugar with remaining ingredients.
Beat until smooth.  Pour into prepared pan.  Set in a pan of hot
water that comes about halfway up the sides.  Bake for 1 hour, cool
and refrigerate overnight.

Loosen edges with the tip of a small knife.  Dip bottom of pan only
into warm water briefly to loosen caramel.  Invert onto rimmed
serving dish. Serve in slices.  If desired, serve with whipped cream
that's flavored with vanilla and sweetened with powdered sugar.

Yield: 12 or more servings.
