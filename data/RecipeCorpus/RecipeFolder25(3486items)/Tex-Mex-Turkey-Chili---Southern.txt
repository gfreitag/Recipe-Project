2 ts Chili powder; or more
1 1/2 ts Cumin
1/2 ts Dried oregano
Salt & fresh-ground pepper
1/4 c  Extra sharp shredded cheese;
-Cheddar, jack, optional
2    Turkey thighs
1 c  Boiling water
28 oz Tomatoes with liquid
2    Large onions; chopped
3    Green peppers;seeded/chopped
2    Garlic cloves; minced
Put turkey thighs on a chopping board; slice meat away from the
bones. Cut meat in 1-inch cubes, discard skin. Spray a non-stick pot
(or pressure cooker) with cooking spray for no-fat frying. Add cubed
meat. Brown over moderate heat in its own melted fat (no added oil
needed). Remove from flame and stir boiling water into juices in pot.
Pour liquid into a cup, set aside until fat rises to surface. With a
bulb-type baster, skim off and discard surface fat.  Return
fat-skimmed liquid to pot. (Bones may be added for flavor and removed
before serving.) Add all remaining ingredients except cheese.  Cover,
simmer over low heat until tender, about 1 hour in conventional pot,
or 20 minutes in pressure cooker. Uncover, continue to simmer until
most of the liquid evaporates and chili is thick. Spoon into serving
dish.  Top with cheese. The Tampa Tribune, Feb. 1993.
