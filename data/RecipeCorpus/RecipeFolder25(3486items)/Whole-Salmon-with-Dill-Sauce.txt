MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
Poach the salmon; To time the poaching, measure the fish and allow 10
minutes for each inch of thickness; begin timing when the poaching
liquid starts to simmer. To check for doneness, insert a metal skewer
into the thick flesh behind the gill. It should slide in easily. A
six-lb salmon needs either a fish poacher or a roasting pan fitted
with a rack at the bottom for easy fish lifting. I use a roaster. It
usually means the fish has been curved to fit in and the benefit of
this is that it retains this jaunty pose once cooked and it fits more
easily onto a platter. Chill it carefully, then unwrap it, and gently
pull off the skin. If the fat underneath the skin is gray, scrape it
away with a knife to reveal the orange flesh. Cut down the center of
the fish to the backbone, and then ease one half of the fillet from
the bones. Gently pull off the flesh, then remove the backbone and
replace the fish. This way it is easier to serve at a buffet. Peel
and halve the cucumbers. Scrape out the seeds, and then thinly slice
them. Arrange the cucumber on top of the salmon in a pattern
resembling fish scales. Slice a lemon, and arrange around the fish.
Chill well. For the sauce, combine the sour cream with the
mayonnaise, and whisk until smooth. Add the onion, lemon juice, dill,
salt and pepper. Serves 10 to 12, or more if there are other entrees.
Note: The fish can be cooked up to a day in advance and refrigerated,
tightly covered. The sauce can be made up to two days in advance and
refrigerated.
