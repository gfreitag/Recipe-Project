Each recipe uses 3 cups of oil. For ground spice oils, buy whole
spices and grind them in a spice grinder, coffee mill, or with a
mortar and pestle.

Master Method for Warm Oil Infusing: Combine oil and flavoring in
nonreactive, heavy-bottomed pan. Starting on lowest heat possible,
bring oil temperature to 140 degrees (use deep-fry or candy
thermometer to gauge temperature), and maintain temperature for 10
minutes as oil weakly bubbles. Carefully transfer oil and flavoring
to bowl and cool to room temperature. Let sit for at least 1 day
before using. Pour into a clean, tightly sealed glass jar and
refrigerate. Use within 1 month.

Master Method for Cold Oil Infusing: In stainless steel, glass, or
ceramic bowl, combine oil and flavoring. Leave loosely covered with
plastic wrap in a cool, dry place for 3 days. The oil may be used at
this point. If making a ground spice oil, strain through two layers
of cheesecloth and discard spice sediment. Pour oil into clean glass
jars with snug-fitting lids. Keep refrigerated and use within 1 month.
