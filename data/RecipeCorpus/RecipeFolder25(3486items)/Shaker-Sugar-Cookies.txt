Fill your cookie crock with old-fashioned sugar cookies - simple yet
delicious with a hint of nutmeg and lemon. Make a double batch!

For 3 dozen cookies you will need:

Sugar, for sprinkling, optional

Preparation:

1. Beat butter until creamy and light. A mixer will easily cream; by
hand it will take longer. 2. Beat in sugar until mixture is creamed.
Add egg and beat. Add vanilla and lemon extracts and nutmeg. 3. In a
separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt.
add flour mixture to creamed mixture. Mix until blended. 4. Chill,
covered, in freezer for about 30 minutes or in refrigerator for 2 to
3 hours. 5. Roll out a portion of dough carefully on a floured board
to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into shapes. 6. Place on greased cookie
sheet. Sprinkle with sugar, if used. 7. Bake at 375 F for 8 minutes.
Cool for a few minutes. 8. Remove to rack to cool completely. Store
in tin.

Tips: When making rolled cookies, the dough needs to be chilled for
easier handling. Use as little flour as possible when rolling out
dough. Divide dough in half. After a few gentle rolling strokes (from
center toward the edges), check to see if dough is sticking. If so,
sprinkle a little more flour under and on top of dough. Continue to
roll, lift and turn dough. Sprinkle with flour as needed. Cut dough
with cookie cutters.
