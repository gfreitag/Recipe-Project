Title: Homemade Kahlua
Categories: Beverage, Alcohol
Yield: 1 recipe
3 c  Good Vodka
1 c  Any Brandy
6 ts Vanilla extract
3 c  Sugar
3 c  Water
12 ts Really good instant coffee
2 tb Fresh coarsely ground coffee
Mix first 4 ingredients and simmer them for 1.5-2 hours with
occasional stirring.

Cool. Add the rest of the stuff. Filter and pour into dark bottles. I
use a metal mesh to keep out the coffee grounds. Keep the bottles in
a cool, dark place for 3 months (YOU HEARD IT RIGHT!).  Shake every
day. (The bottles, I mean).
