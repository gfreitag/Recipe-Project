1/2 c  California ripe olive wedges

1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
1    Chicken bouillon cube
2 c  Water
1 c  Dry white wine
Melt butter in heavy pan with lid, add rice and cook, stirring over
medium heat for 4 minutes or until it just begins to brown and gets a
toasty smell. Crumble bouillon cube into rice, add water and wine,
cover and bring to a boil. Simmer very gently for 13 minutes until al
dente (firm-tender bite). Gradually stir in cream, then add cheese
and olives a portion at a time, stirring all the while until melted
and hot. Stir in more water at the end if needed. Risotto should be
very creamy and rich and a little thicker than soup. Serve in wide
soup bowls with crusty bread and a crisp green salad.
