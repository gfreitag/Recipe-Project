Title: Glazed Bacon Strips
Categories: Appetizer, Pork, Snack
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Brown sugar
1 lb Bacon   (cut slices in half)
line 2 jelly roll pans with aluminum foil.  sprinkle 1/4 Cup brown
sugar over each pan.  lay bacon strips out on top of sugar. Sprinkle
remaining sugar over tops of bacon slices. Bake at 325 degrees for 25
~ 35 minutes, until bacon is crisp. drain slices on brown paper until
cool and excess bacon fat is drained. serve at room temperature. I
generally had to triple this recipe so that my kids wouldn't eat it
all before the party started. COURTESY OF THE HOMESTEAD (615)367-4411
