When cooking wild game, the
-most important think to
-remember is that
Overcooking is the biggest mistake people make when cooking when
preparing wild game. Many people think they can cook the "wild" out
of game, but often the overcooking makes the meat taste strong, and
gives it a dry, stringy texture. Also some cooks think they have to
overcook wild game to "purify' it.  But "wild game is cleaner than
anything you can get in stores." It isn't the animals diet or outdoor
lifestyle that causes most of the problems.  Rather it is the
improper handling before the game gets to the kitchen. Game that is
not processed right away or promptly will taste strong. Because wild
game is lean, it can be drier than beef or poultry. But cooking it
twice as long isn't the solution. Medium-rare is good for tender cuts
of venison, and in general venison can be cooked like beef. Game
birds should be cooked just until the juices run clear, similar to
other poultry. Marinades and sauces can improve flavor and texture a
great deal, but some cooks a intimidated by the word "sauce" You can
mix less-expensive ground beef with a higher fat content with venison
because it is so lean, and still have a dish that is low in total fat.
