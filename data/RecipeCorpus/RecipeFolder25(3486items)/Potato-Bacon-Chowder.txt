* Sometimes I use ham instead. ** I use low-fat powder milk or canned
milk or both. In a large heavy pot, saute onion and celery in
margarine until tender. Add water, Tabasco sauce, Worcestshire sauce,
white pepper, bouillon cubes and salt.  Stir and bring to a simmer.
Add the potatoes and cook until potatoes are tender, not mushy.  Add
the half and half, and bring to a simmer.  If a thicker texture* is
desired, puree one cup of the soup in a food processer, then return
it to pot. Add diced bacon. Serve warm. *I put some instant potatoes
in the soup. Source: The San Diego Union, Years ago before the my
