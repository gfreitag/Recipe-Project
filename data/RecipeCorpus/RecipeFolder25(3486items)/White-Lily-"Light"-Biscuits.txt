Title: White Lily "Light" Biscuits
Categories: Bread
Yield: 1 servings
2/3 ea To 3/4 cup milk or
-buttermilk
2 c  Self rising flour
1/4 c  Shortening
Preheat oven to 500F.  Measure flour into bowl (by spooning into
measuring cup and leveling off).  Cut in shortening until like coarse
crumbs. Blend in just enough milk with fork until dough leaves sides
of bow. (Too much milk makes dough too sticky to handle; not enough
milk makes biscuits dry.) Knead gently on lightly floured surface 10
to 12 strokes. Roll dough about 1/2" thick.  Cut without twisting
cutter. Bake on ungreased baking sheet (1 inch apart for crusty
biscuits; almost touching for soft sides) at 500, for 8 to 10
minutes. Serve at once. Makes about 12 2 inch biscuits. Note: For
tender biscuits always handle dough gently and use as little extra
flour for kneading and rolling as possible.
