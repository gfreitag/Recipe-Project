Almost every pueblo and tribe I visited on my travels throughout the
Southwest had its own recipe for salsa, which is used as a condiment
for every meal.  All the salsas I tasted were hot and spicy to my
palate; this recipe is a combination of the many I tried.  If you
find it too hot for your taste, cut the amount of jalapenos in half.
