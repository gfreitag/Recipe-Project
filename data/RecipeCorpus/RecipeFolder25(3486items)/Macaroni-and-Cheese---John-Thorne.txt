Title: Macaroni and Cheese - John Thorne
Categories: Main dish, Cheese/eggs, Pasta
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Sharp Cheddar cheese; grated
2    Eggs; beaten
1 ts Dry mustard; dissolved in a
;little water
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper
1/2 lb Elbow macaroni
4 tb (1/2 stick) butter; cut into
;bits
ds Tabasco sauce
1 cn (12 oz.) evaporated milk (or
-use whole milk mixed with a
-little cream
Preheat oven to 350F. Boil the macaroni until just barely done in
salted water. Drain and toss with the butter in a large, ovenproof
mixing bowl. Mix the Tabasco into the evaporated milk. Reserving
about 1/3 cup, stir the milk into the macaroni, then add three
quarters of the cheese, the eggs, and the mustard. When well
combined, season to taste with salt and pepper, and set the bowl
directly in the oven. Every five minutes, remove it briefly to stir
in some of the reserved cheese, adding more evaporated milk as
necessary to keep the mixture moist and smooth. When all the cheese
has been incorporated and the mixture is nicely hot and creamy (which
should take 20 minutes, all told), serve it at once, with a plate of
toasted common crackers to crumble over.
No matter how closely you follow my instructions, your macaroni and
cheese will never taste exactly like mine, but we'll hope. I never
made the dish exactly the same way twice, but each time it gets more
divine. -Pearl Bailey
