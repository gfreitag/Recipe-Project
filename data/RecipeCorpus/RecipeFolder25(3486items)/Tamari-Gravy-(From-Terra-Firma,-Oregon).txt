The author wrote: "Ron, strong, stern patriarch of twelve-or-so member
Terra Firma in Oregon, came out of their farmhouse to greet me.  I
explained my visit, and concluding, 'I have a present for you,'
pulled out a pound of cheese.  Ron shook his head.  'We don't eat
cheese here,' he said,' and besides, that kind's got preservatives in
it.' I reddened as he explained that his family avoided
'mucus-forming' meat, dairy products and grains and lived on uncooked
fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds as much as possible. Later I went
around to the other members and tried to give away the damn cheese.
Finally, graciously, one woman accepted it. She stowed it in a far
corner of the refrigerator.

"Ron's commitment to the organic way of life is unusually strong,
partly because he's determined to bring up his young son
uncontaminated by additives and pesticides.  Every week he drives a
school bus to Portland and loads it up with organically grown fruits
and vegetables, which he distributes to several food co-ops in the
Willamette Valley. Earning only enough profit to pay for gas and oil,
he works from the conviction that pure produce should be made
available everywhere."
