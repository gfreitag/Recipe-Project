Title: Basil and Garlic Popovers
Categories: Bread
Yield: 6 popovers
1    Garlic clove; minced
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Snipped fresh basil
1/4 ts Salt
1 tb Shortening
2    Eggs; beaten
1 c  Milk
1 tb Salad oil
Using 1/2 tsp. of shortening for each cup, grease the bottoms and
sides of six 6-ounce custard cups or the cups of a popover pan. Place
custard cups on a 15x10x12" baking pan; set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, milk, salad oil and garlic. Using
a wire whisk or rotary beater, beat egg mixture until combined. Add
the flour, basil and salt.  Beat until smooth.  Fill prepared cups
half full of batter.  Bake at 400 F. for about 40 minutes or until
firm and golden brown.

Immediately after removing popovers from oven, prick each with a fork
to let steam escape.  If you'd like crisper popovers, turn off the
oven and then place the popovers in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes
more. Serve hot.
