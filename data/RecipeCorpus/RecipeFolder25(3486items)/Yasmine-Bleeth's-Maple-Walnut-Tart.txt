"As a kid, I was always fascinated by cooking shows," says Yasmine
Bleeth of BAYWATCH. "All the other kids would be watching Donny and
Marie, and I'd be watching Julia Child."

But Bleeth also learned by watching her grandmothers cook. "My
mother's mother is from North Africa, so I learned to make Algerian
soups and stews from her," say the native New Yorker. "And my
grandmother on my father's side taught me how to make a great roasted
chicken. I love to make everything, especially holiday desserts like
this Maple Walnut Tart. But ever since taking this job" - the role of
swimsuit-clad lifeguard Caroline Holden - "you can be sure I stay
away from THIS recipe. I go on hiatus soon, though, and THEN I can go
back to eating."

Preheat oven to 375'F. Line a 10" removable-bottom tart pan with
crust. Place coffee beans or rice on crust (as pie weights) and bake
for 10 minutes. Remove beans or rice and set crust aside. In a medium
bowl, combine maple syrup, butter, salt and sugar. Using an electric
mixer, beat on high for 5 minutes or until fluffy. Stir in nuts. Pour
into pie shell and bake for 1 hour or until a totthpick comes out
clean. Let cool. Remove rim from tart pan. Serve with fresh whipped
cream lightly sweetened with maple syrup.
