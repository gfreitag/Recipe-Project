Title: English Crumpets (Bakestone Recipes)
Categories: Bread, Breakfast, Snack
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 pt Warm water
1 tb Vegetable oil
1/2 ts Bicarbonate of soda
1/4 pt Warm water
4 oz All-purpose flour
4 oz Bread flour
2 ts Salt
1/4 oz Fresh yeast
1 ts Sugar
Sift the flours and salt into a warm bowl.  Cream the yeast with the
sugar. Add the warmed water, then the oil.  Stir into the flour to
make a batter, and beat vigorously until smooth and elastic. Cover
the bowl, put in a warm place and leave it until the mixture rises
and the surface is full of bubbles (about 1 1/2 hours).  Break it
down by beating with a wooden spoon. Cover and leave in a warm place
to prove for another 30 minutes.

To cook the crumpets, heat and grease the bakestone lightly.  Grease
5 or 6 crumpet rings (3-3 1/2 inches) (or scone cutters) and put them
on the bakestone to heat. Cook as many crumpets as possible at a
time, as the batter will not stay bubbly for long.

Put 1/2 inch deep of batter into each ring. Cook gently for 7 - 10
minutes, or until the surface sets and is full of tiny bubbles. Using
an oven glove for protection, lift off the ring, and if the base of
the crumpet is pale gold, flip it over and cook for another 3 minutes
until the other side is just colored. If the crumpet batter is set
but sticks slightly in the ring, push it out gently with the back of
a wooden spoon. Wipe, grease and heat the rings for each batch of
crumpets. If serving immediately, wrap the crumpets in a cloth and
keep warm between batches. Butter generously and serve at once.

If reheating, toast the crumpets under the grill, cooking the smooth
surface first and then the top so that the butter will melt into the
holes.
