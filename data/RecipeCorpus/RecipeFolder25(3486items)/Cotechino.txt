Categories: Pork, Sausage, Homemade, Italian
Yield: 6 pounds
2 ts Ground nutmeg
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Cayenne
1 ts Finely ground cloves
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
5    Feet small hog casings
5 lb Lean fresh ham, cubed
1 lb Pork skin with fat, cubed
3 ts Salt, or to taste
4 ts Coarse grind black pepper
Grind the meat and skin coarsley. Mix with remaining ingredients and
run through the fine disk. Prepare casings, stuff and twist off into
6-8" links. Separate links, and allow to dry, uncovered, in the
refrigerator for two days, turnig so they dry evenly. Boil for 45
minutes to eat immediately or boil cool and pack in canning jars with
hot melted fat pured over them and store in fridge up to a month. To
use, scoop the sausages out of the jar and reheat them. If they are
drained well after reheating, they are not nearly as high in fat as
you think.
