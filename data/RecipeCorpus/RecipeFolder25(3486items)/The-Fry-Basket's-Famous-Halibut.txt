"The Fry Basket (7057 Yonge St.) serves up the best fish & chips I
have ever tasted," writes Ron Pizzinato of Willowdale. "I've tried
many batter recipes for frying halibut but I haven't been able to
come close to the light, flaky texture of their fish. Could you get
me their recipe?"

Owned and operated by brothers Tom and Steve Rucas, The Fry Basket
has been a family business for two generations and their fish recipe
is a closely-guarded family secret for almost 30 years. But now the
fish is out of the bag! While the ingredients are similar to those in
most batters, the trick to the light and crispy taste is in the
method. The Rucas brothers use only halibut because it it doesn't
taste too fishy and has few bones. THE FRY BASKET'S FAMOUS HALIBUT
