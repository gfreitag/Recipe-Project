Categories: Rice, Holiday, Beans, Vegetable, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2    Chopped Green Pepper
1    Chopped Sweet Onion
2    Cloves crushed Garlic
1/3 c  Chopped Cilantro
1 1/2 t  Powdered Coriander

2 c  Brown Rice
2 c  Black Beans
1    Bay Leaf
2 c  Carrots in 1/4" cubes
1 c  Black Raisins
Olive Oil
Boil rice with bay leaf and set aside. Cook black beans with bay
leaf, but not too mushy. Drain and set them aside too. Steam carrot
still soft but not mushy. In big skillet, gently fry onion, garlic
and peppers in oil until soft. Toast coriander and cardamom in
toaster oven, if you want to bring out more flavor (optional). Add
spices and cilantro to onion/pepper/garlic mix. Add cooked rice,
beans, carrots and raisins. Mix everything well, sprinkle over salt
to taste (plenty --don't be wimpy), turn heat to very low and let it
heat together for awhile (20-30 mins.)
