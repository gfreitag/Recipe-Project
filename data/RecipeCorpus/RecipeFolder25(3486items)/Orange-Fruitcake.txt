*Makes 6 individual loaves and 1 loaf cake.

1.  Preheat oven to 350F.  Coat six 4-inch individual Bundt pans (or
six 4 1/2 x 2 1/2 x 1 1/2-inch mini loaf pans) and one 8x4x2-inch
loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray.

2.  Stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt
and nutmeg in medium-size bowl until well mixed.  Combine pecans,
cherries, raisins, candied orange peel, and grated rind in another
bowl. Stir a ew tablespoons flour mixture into pecan mixture to coat
ingredients.

3.  Beat together butter and 1 cup sugar in large bowl until smooth
and creamy.  Beat in eggs, one at a time.  Beat until light and
fluffy, 2 minutes.  Stir in flour mixture alternately with buttermilk
until blended, beginning and ending with flour.  Gently stir in pecan
mixture. Spoon 1/2 cup batter into each prepared Bundt or mini loaf
pan; spoon remaining batter into prepared loaf pan.

4.  Bake in preheated 350F oven until wooden pick inserted in center
comes out clean--20 minutes for individual loaves, 35 minutes for
large loaf.

5.  Meanwhile, combine remaining 1/2 cup sugar and orange juice in
small saucepan.  Bring to boiling, stirring to dissolve sugar. Remove
from heat; stir in orange liqueur, if using.

6.  When cakes are done, remove from oven.  Let stand in pans on wire
rack 10 minutes.  Prick holes in cakes with long-tined fork.  Spoon
orange syrup over cakes.  Cool until slightly warm.  Remove from
pans. Cool on wire rack.  Drizzle top with Confectioners' Sugar Glaze
and decorate with orange-rind star cutouts, if you wish.
