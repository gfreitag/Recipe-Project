1/3 c  Butter
2 c  Powdered sugar

In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites, cream of tartar and salt on medium

well after each addition; beat until smooth and glossy and stiff
peaks form. Add extracts on low speed. Combine powdered sugar and
flour; gently fold into egg mixture.  Pour into an ungreased 10" tube
pan. Bake on the lowest rack at 375 degrees for 35-40 minutes or
until top crust is golden brown and cracks feel dry. Immediately
invert cake in pan to cool completely. Loosen sides of cake from pan
and remove.  For glaze, melt butter in a saucepan. Stir in the
powdered sugar and cinnamon. Add apple juice slowly until glaze is
thin enough to drizzle. Drizzle over cake. Serves: 12-16 From: "Taste
