Title: Cheesecake (Ellen's)
Categories: Dessert, Cake/cookie, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
-softened
2 c  Sour cream
1 t  Vanilla
4 T  Sugar
Cheesecake Filling
4 ea Eggs
1 c  Sugar
1 T  Lemon juice
4 ea (8 oz) pkgs cream cheese,
Line a spring form pan with a graham cracker crust.  Preheat the oven
to 375 degrees. Beat eggs, sugar, and lemon juice until light. Add
the cheese and beat thoroughly. Pour filling into crust and bake for
20 minutes. Remove cake from oven, turn oven up to 475 degrees.  Top
cake with sour cream mixed with vanilla and sugar. Bake 10 minutes.
Cool and chill overnight before serving. (I sometimes make half the
filling and bake it in a regular pie pan.  If you like the Sara Lee
cake, I'll bet you'll like this one.) *Ellen*
