2. Heat wok up with 1 tablespoon oil and fry egg into a thin sheet.
Remove to plate and reserve.

3. Add 2 tablespoons more oil to wok. Heat until smoking. Stir fry
chicken and onion together until cooked. (If leftover meat is used,
just heat through.) Add bean sprouts, peas, celery. Stir and cook 2
minutes with wok covered. Uncover wok, add all the rest of the
vegetables. Stir fry and cook covered for 2 additional minutes. Add
cooked rice, season with salt, pepper, soya sauce. Reduce heat to
medium. Take your turner and break up clumps of rice as finely as
possible. Make sure rice takes up soya sauce and does not remain
white. Keep stir-frying until all rice is broken up and heated
through. Shut heat off. Cut up sheet of egg into small pieces and
stir into rice, or remove rice to serving platter and garnish with
egg slivers.

NOTE: Leftover rice makes a better fried rice. If using leftover rice,
place rice in sieve and rinse with hot water from the tap. Pork ,
beef or shrimps (cooked or uncooked) may be substituted for above
chicken. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   11-07-94
