First make the sauce.  Pure the raspberries in a food processor or by
rubbing them through a wire strainer.  Stir in the icing sugar and the
lemon juice.  Add more sugar, if necessary.

Sieve the sauce to remove the pips.  Keep cold.

Preheat the oven to 200øC/400øF/Gas Mark 6.  Grease a souffl dish or
individual ramekins with the butter and coat with 1 T of the sugar.
Place on a baking sheet.

Mix the raspberries with half the remaining sugar and work in a food
processor.  Alternatively, pure the raspberries by rubbing them
through a wire strainer and then stir in the sugar.  Mix the pure
with egg yolks and lemon juice.

Beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.  Beat in the
remaining sugar.  Beat until the mixture is stiff and shiny.

Carefully mix the raspberry pure with the beaten egg whites.

Spoon the souffl mixture into the prepared dish or dishes.  Smooth
the top.

Place the tray in the bottom of the oven.  Bake for 12 mins until the
souffl has risen well.

Sprinkle over the icing sugar and serve immediately with the raspberry
sauce.
