Cut up gumdrops and orange slices.  Dredge raisins, nut meats,
gumdrops and orange pieces in flour. (Our sister-in-law dredges the
night before. She said using hands is acceptable) Preheat oven to 300
degrees. Cream sugar, butter or margarine, together, add applesauce,
eggs, and blended well. Mix flour, cinnamon, cloves and salt, add to
egg mixture. Add soda and water mixture to the batter.  Mix well.
Add gumdrop mixture to cake mixture. Spray with nonstick spray either
square cake pan, round cake pan, angle food cake pan or bundt pan
(which is the best for us). Our sister-in-law uses little individual
loaf pans.  She gets about 18 little loaf and 1 large loaf out of 1
batch. Cook for about 1-1/2 to 2 hours, depending on size of pans.
(You sort of use your nose to judge the cooking time.)
