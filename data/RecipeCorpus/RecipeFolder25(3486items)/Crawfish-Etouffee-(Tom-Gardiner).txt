Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish, Crab/shrimp
Yield: 1 servings
1 t  Minced garlic
1/2 ea - 1 tsp brown roux
1/2 t  Red pepper
1/2 ea - 1 tsp black pepper
3 ea Chicken bouillon cubes
1 lb UNrinsed crawfish tails
-(the crawfish fat is the
-secret to
The taste)
5 T  Flour
3 T  Chopped parsley
1/2 c  Or more chopped green onion
-tops (I recommend the
-'more'
Option)
2 c  Water
This is the very best
-recipe for crawfish
-etouffee I have ever
Found, and growing up in
-the parish seat of Acadia
-Parish affords
One a vast opportunity for
-a bountiful search.  So,
-from one
Hungry cajun..."Y'all enjoy
-dis, cher!"
3/4 c  Butter (the real stuff
-makes all the difference)
2 c  Chopped onion
1/2 c  Chopped green onion bottoms
1/4 c  Chopped bell pepper
1/4 c  Chopped celery
Saute butter, onion, green onion bottoms, bell pepper, celery, garlic,
roux, red and black pepper and bouillon cubes in a saucepan until
tender. add crawfish tails, flour, parsley, and green onion tops and
cook for 3 minutes.  Stir in water and cook until thickened. Serve
over a bed of steamed rice. *Shrimp can be used instead of crawfish,
but it really loses something in the 'translation'.
