MMMMM-------------------------1 LB LOAF------------------------------
1 ts Salt

2 ts Red Star Active Dry Yeast
2/3 c  Quaker Multigrain cereal
3/4 c  Buttermilk **

1 1/3 c  Bread flour

* for Welbilt/DAK and Zojirushi machines, add 3 tablespoons more
buttermilk. ** for Welbilt machine, add 1 tablespoon more buttermilk.

I use buttermilk powder which can usually be found at large grocery
stores - and water. (see cannister for amount)

Have ingredients at room temperature (For my Hitachi I will microwave
liquids for 1 minute)

Place all ingredients in bread pan according to manufacturers
instructions. Use Light baking setting.

I have made the 1 1/2 lb loaf. This made a medium size dense loaf, cut
well. Great for sandwiches.
