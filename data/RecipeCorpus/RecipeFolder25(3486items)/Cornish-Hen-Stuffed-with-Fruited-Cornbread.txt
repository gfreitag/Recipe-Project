Title: Cornish Hen Stuffed with Fruited Cornbread
Categories: Poultry, Bread
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Cinnamon
1 c  Port wine
1 c  Fresh squeezed orange juice
1    Orange; peel of; chopped
3/4 c  Chicken broth
8    To 10 cornish hens
Salt/pepper
Cinnamon
1/2 c  Butter; melted
2 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
Wash and thoroughly dry Cornish hens.  Season the inside of the bird
with salt, pepper and cinnamon. Stuff the birds, taking care not to
pack the cavity too tightly. Tie the legs together to maintain the
shape during roasting.  Make a mixture of 1/2 cup melted butter, 2
teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and brush this
all over the birds. Place breast down a rack in a shallow roasting
pan and cook in a preheated 350~ oven for 45 minutes to an hour,
basting every 10 minutes with the following mixture: 1 cup Port wine
mixed with 1 cup fresh squeezed orange juice and the finely chopped
peel of one orange. When birds have been roasting for 20 minutes,
turn them breast side up, baste and continue roasting until bird is
finished.  NOTE:  Add 3/4 cup chicken broth to the bottom of the pan
before you roast the chickens. If there is any basting mixture left,
add it to any accumulated juices on the bottom of the pan and bring
this to a boil just before serving. If you don't want to stuff the
birds, simply bake the stuffing right along with the hens, in a
covered casserole dish, removing the cover about 15 minutes before
the birds are cooked. A number of years ago I had a take out food
shop and these hens were one of the most popular poultry items we
sold. I hope you enjoy them. If you have any questions, please don't
