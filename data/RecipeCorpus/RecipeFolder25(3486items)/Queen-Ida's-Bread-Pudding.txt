Title: Queen Ida's Bread Pudding
Categories: Dessert, Cajun/creol, Pudding
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Netmeg
1/8 ts Ground cloves
3 tb Raisins, soaked in warm
Water 5 minutes and drained
(Or soaked in 1/2 cup rum)
1/3 c  Butter, melted
12 sl Day old bread
4    Eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 c  Evaporated milk OR
Heavy cream OR half-N-half
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Vanilla
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Place bread on a cookie sheet and
toast lightly, about 4 minutes a side, so it won't be too soggy.
Break bread into small pieces and place in a bowl.  Add eggs, whole
milk, evaporated milk, sugar, baking powder, vanilla, cinnamon,
nutmeg, and cloves. Drain the raisins; reserve the rum, if using, for
the sauce. Stir in raisins and butter.  Pour mixture into a
well-greased baking dish about 11"x14"x2" (such as a lasagna pan) and
bake 20 minutes. Using a fork, test a little pudding from the center
to see whether it's cooked. The custard should be very slightly
browned but not dry. Let cool and slice. Serve with lemon sauce or
hard sauce. Submitted By FRED TOWNER   On   10-28-94
