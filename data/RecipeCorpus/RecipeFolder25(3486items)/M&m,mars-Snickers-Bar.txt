Title: M&m/mars Snickers Bar
Categories: Candy, Chocolate, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
3 c  Powdered sugar
35 ea Unwrapped Kraft caramels
1 c  Dry-roasted unsalted peanuts
12 oz Milk chocolate chips
1/4 c  Light corn syrup
2 T  Butter, softened
1 t  Vanilla extract
1/8 c  Creamy peanut butter
ds Salt
With the mixer on high speed, combine the corn syrup, butter, vanilla,
peanut butter, and salt until creamy. Slowly add the powdered sugar.
When the mixture has the consistency of dough, remove it from the
bowl with your hands and press it into a lightly greased 9x9" pan.
Set in the refrigerator. Melt the caramels in a small pan over low
heat. When the caramel is soft, mix in the peanuts.  Pour the mixture
over the refrigerated nougat in the pan.  Let this cool in the
refrigerator. When the refrigerator mixture is firm, melt the
chocolate over low heat in a double boiler or in a microwave oven set
on high for 2 minutes. Stir halfway through cooking time. When the
mixture in the pan has hardened, cut into 2x1" sections. Set each
chunk onto a fork and dip into the melted chocolate.  Tap the fork
against the side of the bowl or pan to knock off any excess
chocolate.  Then place the chunks on waxed paper to cool at room
temperature (less than 70 degrees.) This could take several hours,
but the bars will set best this way.  You can speed up the process by
placing the bars in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Makes: 2 dozen
