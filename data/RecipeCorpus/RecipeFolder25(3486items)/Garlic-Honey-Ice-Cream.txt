Garlic and honey are an ancient combination used in various cultures
to treat colds and coughs and as a general tonic.  Here, we heat the
ingredients together to infuse the honey with garlic flavor, but
traditionally peeled garlic cloves are simply steeped in honey for a
week or longer.  Honey is hygroscopic, drawing out garlic's moisture
and flavor. Most people who eat this ice cream cannot identify garlic
in it, though they can tell that it contains some unusual ingredient.
The honey gives it a fine texture. 6 large garlic cloves, peeled 2/3
cup or 8 oz. (160 ml. or 225 g.) light honey such as orange or clover
1 c. (240 ml.) whipping (double) cream 2 c. (475 ml.) half-and-half
(single) cream 3 egg yolks

Place the garlic and honey in a small heavy saucepan.  Bring the
honey just to a simmer over low heat.  This takes about 5 minutes,
but watch carefully, as the honey can bubble over and/or caramelize
all at once. Remove the pan from heat, cover and let the garlic steep
overnight. Remove the garlic when you are ready to proceed. Dissolve
the honey in the creams over medium-low heat.  Beat the egg yolks
lightly in a small bowl. Beat in about half cup (120 ml.) of cream to
warm the egg yolks, then pour the yolk mixture to the pan. Stir the
mixture over medium heat until the custard just coats a metal spoon.
Strain the custard through a sieve into a bowl and chill it
thoroughly, covered, overnight in the refrigerator or in an ice water
bath. Pour the chilled custard into an ice cream freezer and follow
the manufacturer's instructions.
