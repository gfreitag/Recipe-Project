If using oil-packed tomatoes, drain well and pat dry. Mince. If using
dehydrated, soak in water for a few minutes according to directions on
package. Dry, then mince. Cut mozzarella into 1/4-inch cubes. Chop
fresh basil leaves finely. Mince garlic clove, use more garlic if
preferred. Combine the cheese, basil, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes and
black pepper in small bowl. Add the olive oil and blend well. Cover
and refrigerate 1 hour to blend flavors. Just before serving, prepare
cherry tomatoes by removing the stem end, cutting a thin slice from
bottom of tomato to keep it setting straight and removing center from
tomatoes with melon baller or small spoon. Sprinkle inside of
tomatoes very lightly with salt and invert on paper towels to drain
briefly. Stuff the tomatoes with the cheese mixture, garnish with
small basil leaves and serve immediately. For best flavor fresh
tomatoes should not be refrigerated; plan on serving these soon after
filling. From: CHESTER FOSTER
