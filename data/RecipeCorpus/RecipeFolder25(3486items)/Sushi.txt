In 8-cup saucepan, cover and bring water and rice to boil; boil for 2
minutes.  Reduce heat to low; cook for 15 minutes.  Remove from heat;
let stand, covered for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in small saucepan,
bring vinegar, sugar, mirin and salt to boil, stirring just until
sugar dissolves; let cool. Spread rice in a large shallow dish.
Sprinkle with half of the vinegar mixture; toss with a fork until
combined. Toss with remaining vinegar mixture. Cover with damp tea
towel; refrigerate for 45 minutes or until cooled to room
temperature. Meanwhile toast nori sheets by quickly brushing over
element on high heat 10 times per side; set aside. Filling:
Meanwhile, in small saucepan, soak mushrooms in 1/2 cup of warm water
for 30 minutes.  Add soy sauce and sugar; simmer for 10 minutes or
until no liquid remains.  Discard stems; slice caps thinly.  Combine
wasabi with a few drops of water to from a paste. Place rolling mat
(maku-su) on work surface with shortest side closest; place nori
sheet, shiny side down, on mat.  With wet fingers, press one-quater
of the rice evenly over nori, leaving 1-inch border on far side
uncovered. Dab thin line of wasabi over 1/2 inch from closest edge.
Top with one-quater each of crab, then mushrooms.  Arrange
one-quarter of the cucumber in row beside mushrooms; top with
one-quarter of the watercress. Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp sesame seeds.
Holding filling in place with fingers, tightly roll mat over filling.
Using mat as guide, continue to roll up firmly, jelly-roll style,
squeezing to compress.  With shark wet knife, trim ends; cut roll
into eight 1/2 inch thick slices.  Repeat with remaining ingedients.
Notes: Roll into the world of Japanese cooking with our step-by-step
directions for sushi. Elegant as appetizers, fun for a summer picnic,
rolls of sushi rice with crab, cucumber and watercress are as
beautiful as they are light and fresh-tasting.  There are many other
striking combinations of flavors and colors, such as cooked shrimp,
pickled Japanese vegetables, avocado and omelette strips. Tips:
Japanese ingredients, such as nori, mirin and wasabi, are available
in Oriental food stores or by mail order. A good substitute for a
rolling mat is a placemat or folded tea towel. Sushi rice should be
served the day it is cooked. Serve a small mound of Japanese pickled
ginger and soy sauce and wasabi horseradish to blend for dipping.
