Glaze a 1-litre/1 3/4 pint mould.  Put the sugar in a frying-pan and
melt over low heat, stirring until an even light brown.  Pour in the
boiling water and stir until smooth.  Pour instantly into a warm
mould.  Turn the mould around so the caramel covers all the sides and
bases.

Preheat the oven to 170øC/325øF/Gas Mark 3.  Bring the cream and
sugar to the boil in the frying-pan that was used for the glazing
mixture.  Add the grated almonds and vanilla essence.

Beat the eggs and egg yolk together and pour on to the hot mixture,
beating vigorously.  Pour the mixture into the glazed mould.  Cover
with a lid or foil and secure the edges well.

Stand the mould in a roasting tin half filled with hot water and bake
in the oven for approximately 45 mins.  Test with a skewer.

Allow the pudding to cool in the mould.  Carefully turn out on to a
serving dish and garnish with the chopped almonds.
