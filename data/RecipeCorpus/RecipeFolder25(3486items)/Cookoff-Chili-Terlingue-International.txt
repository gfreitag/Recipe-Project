Categories: Chili, Meat
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM---------------------P DUFFIELD SNTH24A--------------------------
2 tb Ground cumin
1 tb Paprika
1/4 ts Ground oregano
1/2 ts Red (cayenne) pepper
1/2 ts Onion powder
1 tb Garlic powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts MSG
3 lb Lean beef; chuck tender
Cut into quarter-inch cubes
2 tb Onion powder
1 ts Garlic powder
2    8 oz cans tomato sauce
2 tb Chili powder
Mix together the following:
4 tb Chili powder
Sear meat in large, heavypot. Add onion powder and garlic powder,
tomato sauce and one-half mixed seasonings. Add water or beef broth
to just cover meat. Stir and cook two to three hours until meat is
nearly tender. About half an hour before completion, add remaining
spices and continue cooking until meat is done. Add more salt if
needed. During cooking add additional water and/or beef broth to keep
meat covered with gravy of a nice consistency (not too thick or
thin). This recipe can be made hotter or milder by increasing or
decreasing the red and white peppers. Just before turn-in, check the
salt and the hotness of the chili and add red pepper, salt or a
little sugar if the chili is bitter. This is a good basic recipe but
you must make it your own by adding or changing amounts and
ingredients.  Work with this recipe and it should do well by you. Yes
I have qualified for Terlingua this year.

This is a recipe writen by Judie King of San Antonio, a very fine
chili cook and a constant winner.
