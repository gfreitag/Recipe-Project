Title: Honey-Baked Ham
Categories: Pork, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
1/3 c  Honey
1/3 c  Real maple syrup
-SAUCE:
1 1/4 c  Chicken stock
3    Tbls real maple syrup
2    Tbls Dijon mustard
2 ts Cornstarch
1    Smoked ham, ready to eat
-(13 to 15 lbs, but smaller
-is OK)
2 lg Bottles gingerale
3 c  White dry wine
-GLAZE:
5    Tbls Dijon mustard
Remove the rind from ham and score with diagonal cross-cuts. Put the
ham in a close fitting kettle and pour gingerale over it, bring to a
boil, and simmer for 20 minutes. This removes the too salty taste,
and adds flavor. Put the ham in your roasting pan and pour the wine
on top. Cover with foil, and bake at 350~ for 1 hour. Combine the
GLAZE ingredients. After the ham has baked 1 hour, remove the foil
and brush the ham with glaze, using all of it. Return the ham to
oven, and bake an additional 1-1/2 hours, OR until the internal temp
reaches 140~. Baste occasionally after the glaze has "set" (about 45
min). If the glaze gets too dark before the ham is 140~, cover with
foil and continue baking. When the ham is done, transfer it to a
serving platter and keep warm with the foil. Skim the fat from the
pan juices, reserving all the meat juices and caramelized bits from
the glaze. Heat this to a boil along with 1 cup chicken stock
(reserve 1/4 cup), syrup and mustard.  Dissolve the cornstarch in 1/4
cup of reserved chicken stock and whisk it into the glaze to thicken
it. Strain the sauce and pour into a serving/gravy boat.  It will
have a rich dark color and wonderful aroma. Serve the sauce over the
slices of ham.
