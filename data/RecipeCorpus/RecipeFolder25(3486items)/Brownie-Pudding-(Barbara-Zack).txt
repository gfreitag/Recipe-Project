Here's one my mother used
-to make frequently.  It's
-so rich that
You'll be sorry if you try
-to serve it without some
-vanilla ice
Cream to wash it down with.
2 T  Butter, melted
1/2 c  Milk
1 t  Vanilla
Mix together butter, milk, vanilla, flour, sugar, 2 Tbsp cocoa, baking
powder, salt and walnuts.  Place in a buttered casserole. Mix together
brown sugar and 2 Tbsp cocoa.  Sprinkle over chocolate mixture. Pour
boiling water in casserole.  Bake for 30-40 min. Serve hot with lots
of vanilla ice cream. It looks like a watery mess when it goes into
the oven, but a cake/brownie rises to the top leaving a rich
chocolate sauce beneath it.
