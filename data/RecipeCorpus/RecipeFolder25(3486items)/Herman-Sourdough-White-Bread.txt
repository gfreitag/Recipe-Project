Title: Herman Sourdough White Bread
Categories: Bread
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Hot water
6 tb Shortening
4 ts Salt
10 c  All-purpose or bread flour
2 c  Herman Starter
1 pk Dry yeast
1/3 c  Warm water
2 c  Herman Starter
Combine yeast, 1/3 cup water and 1/3 cup sugar in small bowl.  Set
aside to rise.  In large mixing bowl (not metal) combine hot water,
shortening, salt and 2 cups of the flour.  Cool to point where dough
against the wrist feels slightly warm.  Add yeast mixture and the
Herman Starter. Gradually stir in the rest of the flour until thick
enough to knead on floured board. Knead 12 minutes.  Place in greased
bowl, turn to grease all sides, cover and let rise until doubled
(approximately 2 hours). Punch down and knead 2 minutes. Cover and
let rise again until doubled. Knead down and cut into 4 equal
sections.  Cover and let rest 10 minutes.  Mold into loaves and place
in 4 greased pans, cover and let raise until doubled (or until loaf
is near the size you wish the finished loaf to be).
Preheat oven to 425 degrees and then turn down to 400 degrees when
you put loaves into the oven.  Bake 40 to 45 minutes for loaves.  For
rolls bake 20 to 25 minutes.  Double freezer wrap extra loaves and
freeze.

This note accompanied the recipe:  This is the best white bread we
know of to date.  Keeps very well and toasts beautifully.  We
sometimes start this bread after the evening meal.  Punch it down
before going to bed. Finish as per recipe in the morning.
