2 c  Water
16 lg Tart juicy apples, washed
Add 2/3 cup of this mixture
-to 1 quart of low-pectin
-fruit when making
Jelly. Makes about 3
Pour water into a large stainless steel kettle, and bring to a boil.
Do not core or peel apples, as seeds, cores, and skin contain the
lions share of pectin.  Just cut them in half, lay them cut-side down
on a cutting board, and using a long knife, cut halves into slices
and put them right into the pot.  When all the apples are in the pot
and water is boiling fast, reduce heat,  cover, and simmer for 30
minutes; apples will be very soft. Fit a colander with 6 layers of
rinsed cheesecloth.  Drain apples in colander over a large bowl
(without pressing on fruit if pectin is to be used in the making of
clear jelly) for 10 to 12 hours. Pour juice into a medium-size
saucepan, and reduce to two-thirds the original volume by boiling
rapidly, uncovered.  Cool liquid.  Pour 2/3 cup into individual
freezer containers, and freeze until needed. NOTE: If you dislike
throwing away the apple pulp, put it through a food mill, and it
becomes apple sauce. Or add 1/2 cup honey, 1 tsp. ground cloves, and
cook over very low heat for 30 minutes, or until very thick and
smooth. Then you will have 2 cups of apple butter. Keep refrigerated.
