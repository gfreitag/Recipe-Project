Categories: Appetizer, Pie/tart, Sthrn/livng, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 12 tarts
6 oz Mushrooms, sliced
1 c  Cream, heavy
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1/8 ts Nutmeg, ground
Pastry for 2-crust pie
3    Eggs
2 tb Shallots; finely chopped
3 tb Wine, dry white
1 tb Chives; chopped
Prepare pastry and roll out, half at a time.  Cut into 4-inch circles
and line tart pans or large muffin cups.  Beat eggs in mixing bowl
and brush a small amount of the beaten eggs over the inside of the
tart shells; reserve remaining eggs for filling mixture.

Combine shallots, wine, and chives in small saucepan.  Bring to a
boil, reduce heat, and simmer 2 minutes.  Cool.  Drain liquid from
mushrooms into 2 cup measure (there should be about 1/2 cup).  Add
heavy cream to make 1-1/2 cups; if necessary, add milk to complete
the 1-1/2 cups. Add cream mixture to beaten eggs with salt, pepper,
and nutmeg; beat until well blended.  Stir in shallot mixture. Divide
drained mushrooms among tart shells.  Add about 1/4 cup of egg-cream
mixture to each. Place on baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees for 15
to 20 minutes.
