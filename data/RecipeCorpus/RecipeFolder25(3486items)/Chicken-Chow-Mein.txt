Put above ingredients in a crock pot in the morning.  Mix and
:
put crockpot on low for all day cooking.  Prepare rice.  Put 2
handfulls of bean sprouts or 1 can, or 1 can chinese vetables in
crock pot and mix. When rice is cooked, serve chicken over rice.
Chicken will be so tender it wsill literally fall off the bones.  The
chicken is then easily deboned, and everrthing can be mixed together,
chow mein and rice, or server over the rice.
