Title: Good for You Gouda
Categories: Vegetarian, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
2 ts Onion granules
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Garlic granules
1/2 ts Mustard powder
1/4 ts Turmeric
1/4 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1 3/4 c  Water
1/2 c  Chopped carrots
5 tb Dry, unroasted cashew pieces
1/4 c  Nutritional yeast flakes
3 tb Tahini
3 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Dijon mustard
In a saucepan, bring carrots and water to a boil.

Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.  Uncover and add agar
flakes, stir, then bring back to a boil again.  Reduce heat and cook
5 more minutes.

Transfer mixture to a blender.  Add remaining ingredients and blend
until smooth.

Immediately pour mixture into a lightly oiled bowl or decorative
mold. Let cool, then refrigerate, covered, for several hours.  Remove
from mold before serving and serve sliced into wedges.

Note from Karen:  I substituted peanut butter for the tahini, and
didn't use any onion granules at all.  Tasted great to me.  :)
