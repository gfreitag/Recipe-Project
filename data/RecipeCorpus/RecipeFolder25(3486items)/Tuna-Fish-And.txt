Categories: Diabetic, Kids, Salad, Sandwich, Fish
Yield: 1 sandwich
Onion minced
Pickle relish
Pickle diced
Egg chopped
Alfalfa sprouts
Margarine or mayonnaise
2 sl Bread (any kind)
Lettuce leaf
1 cn Tuna fish
Mayonnaise &/or plain yogurt
-to taste
Add any of the following
Carrots grated
Celery diced
Cucumber diced
Green &/or red pepper diced
Empty the can of tuna into a small bowl.  Mix in just enough
mayonnaise and/or yogurt to bind the tuna. Add as many of the
additional ingredients as you think your child will enjoy.  Spread a
thin layer of margarine or mayonnaise on two slices of bread.  Pile
on the tuna and a leaf of lettuce and close the sandwich.  Since you
have enough for tuna salad for more than one sandwich, store leftover
in an air tight container in the refrigerator. NOTE: This recipe
works well with crabmeat and salmon too. Source: The Creative Lunch
