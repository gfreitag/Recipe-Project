Title: Sweet Watermelon Ice
Categories: Native amer, Fruit, Ice cream
Yield: 3 cups
2 tb Freshly squeezed lemon juice
3 c  Fresh Watermelon juice
3 tb Sugar
Pour the watermelon juice into a shallow glass baking dish.  Add the
sugar and lemon juice and stir well.  Place the dish in the freezer
and chill.

Remove the pan every 1/2 hour and stir.  The juice will form light,
grainy ice crystals as it freezes.  Repeat this process until
thejuice is fully frozen, about 4 hours, depending on the temperature
of your freezer. You can also use an ice cream maker, following the
manufacturer's directions.

Serve immediately, or store in the freezer in a covered container up
to several weeks. **********************

This recipe makes a refreshing ice that is perfect for hot weather.
