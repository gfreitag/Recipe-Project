Title: 3-Grain Breakfast
Categories: Nuts/grains, Breakfast, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Oats; uncooked
1/2 c  Cereal, Grape nuts
1/2 c  Rice, brown; cooked
Add a little Rice Dream or other milk substitute for moisture.

Suggested toppings include: applesauce and cinnamon, 100% fruit
spread, blueberries, raisins, etc.  If the topping is pretty moist, I
even skip the Rice Dream, as I did this morning with the fresh
blueberries. I don't add any other sweetener either, as the fruit is
sweet enough.
