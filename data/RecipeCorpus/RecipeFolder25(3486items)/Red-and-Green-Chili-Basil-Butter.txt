Title: Red and Green Chili Basil Butter
Categories: Herbs/spice, Spread
Yield: 1 batch
-- either sweet or hot
3 tb Finely shredded basil leaves
1/8 ts Toasted and ground cumin
1/4 lb Unsalted butter; softened
1 tb Finely diced green pepper
-- either sweet or hot
1 tb Finely diced red pepper
Mix all ingredients together. Place the mixture on a sheet of waxed
paper about 10" long.  With the blunt side of a chef's knife, roll
the butter into a compact cylinder.

Chill the butter until it is firm enough to cut easily; divide into 8
or 12 portions.  Wrap the butter well in plastic wrap.  For storage
beyond 3 or 4 days, the butter may be frozen.

Dille writes: "This is another versatile quick garnish to make
something special of daily foods.  It is good with beef, pork,
chicken and fish, either grilled or sauteed.  It also enhances
grilled eggplant, and grilled, roasted or steamed potatoes and
onions. When I have mature hot red peppers, such as hot cherry
peppers, I use them along with sweet green pepper. Either serranos or
jalapenos are good as the hot green component paired with sweet red
pepper."
