heating element on my Little Chief smoker and found a friend who
would do it for me. But here are a few suggestions. When I am going
to smoke fish, I leave the skin on it because it holds the meat
together. Marinating the fish in brine (1 cup of salt to one gallon
of water) depends on the thickness of the fish to be smoked. One half
inch slabs should be marinated at least 45 minutes while one inch
slabs should be marinated for one hour and 15 minutes. If you remove
the skin, you can reduce the marinating time somewhat, but at least
30 minutes for 1/2 inch fillets and 45 minutes for 1 inch fillets.
Whole dressed fish should be marinated 45 minutes. The length of time
to be smoked depends on the thickness of the fish and the heat in the
smoker. One half inch slabs should be smoke 1 hour and 30 minutes at
150-175 degrees. At 200 degrees the time is reduced to 45 minutes and
at 250 degrees the time is cut to 30 minutes. For one-inch slabs
smoke for 1 hour and 45 minutes at 15++175 degrees, 30 to 45 minutes
at 200 degrees and 30 minutes at 250 degrees. Whole fish should be
smoked 2 hours at 150-175 degrees and 1 hour and 15 minutes at 200
degrees and 45 to 50 minutes at 250 degrees. You should baste the
fish occasionally with vegetable oil. I usually used hickory chips
because they were available, but cherry and apple chips do a good
job, also.
