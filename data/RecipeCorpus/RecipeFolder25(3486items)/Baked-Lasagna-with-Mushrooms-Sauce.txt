This is a three step recipe.  Frist, make a sauce thus: In a deep
saucepan, heat oil and in it brown garlic and onion.  Remove or not
as you wish. In the oil brown the mushrooms, remove, and put aside.
To the oil add tomatoes and cook very slowly for 1 hour or until pulp
has broken completely. Add tomato paste mixed with water and cook 15
minutes longer. The sauce is now ready. Second: Boil lasagna in
salted water for 8 minutes. Wash under running cold water and leave
soaking in water. Third: Cover the bottom of a baking dish with some
of the sauce.  Over this place place a layer of drained lasagne.
Cover this with sauce. Over this place a layer of drained lasagna.
Cover this with sauce and prinkle with cheese. Bake in a 350 degrees
oven for 30 minutes. I had some extra seasnonings....Next time I will
put some LOW_FAT COTTATE CHEESE and some sort of meats, maybe.
