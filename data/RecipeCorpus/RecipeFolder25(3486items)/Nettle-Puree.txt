Title: Nettle Puree
Categories: Ancient, Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings  Put young nettle tops into boiling water and boil until tender.
Sorrel, dandelion, spinach, sow thistle, watercress and lady's smock
all may be used.  If the more bitter herbs--dandelion and sow
thistle--are used alone, change the water after five minutes' boiling.

Drain well and chop finely.

Reheat, adding butter and salt to taste.

(Cooking in a liberal amount of fast-boiling water will conserve the
vitamins better than slow, gentle cooking.)
