Title: Buttermilk Pralines
Categories: Candy, Nuts/grains
Yield: 20 pralines
1/8 ts Salt
2 tb Butter/margarine
2 1/2 c  Pecan halves
2 c  Granulated sugar
1 ts Baking soda
1 c  Buttermilk
Combine sugar, soda, buttermilk and salt in a 3 1/2 quart heavy sauce
pan. Cook for about 5 minutes over high heat or to 210 degrees on a
candy thermometer.  Stir often, scraping the bottom of the pan; the
mixture will foam up.  Add butter or margarine and pecans.

Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring constatly and scraping the
sides and bottom of pan until the candy reaches the soft-ball stage
(234 defrees on the candy thermomter).  Remove from the heat and cool
slightly for about 2 minutes.  Seat with a spoon until thick and
creamy.  Next, drop by tablespoons onto a sheet of waxed paper or
aluminum foil.  Let the pralines cool completely.
