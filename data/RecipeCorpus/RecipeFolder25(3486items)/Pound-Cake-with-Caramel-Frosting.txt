eggs, one at a time, beating just until yellow disappears.

Add flour to butter mixture alternately with half-and-half, beginning
and ending with flour.  Mix at low speed just until blended after each
addition.  Stir in vanilla.  Pour batter into a greased and floured
10" tube pan.

Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 15 to 20 minutes.  Cool in pan on
a wire rack 10 to 15 minutes; remove cake from pan, and cool

Easy Caramel Frosting: Melt butter in a heavy saucepan. Add brown
sugar; cook over low heat, stirring constantly, 1-1/2 to 2 minutes or
until sugar dissolves. (Do not boil.) Remove from heat.

Stir in whipping cream.  Add powdered sugar and vanilla.

Beat at high speed with an electric mixer until frosting is smooth
and of spreading consistency.  Yield: enough for a 10" cake.
