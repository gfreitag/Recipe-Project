Title: Easy Doughnuts
Categories: Doughnut
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Milk
1 1/2 t  Vanilla
7 c  Flour
1 1/2 t  Nutmeg
2 c  White sugar
6    Eggs
6 T  Oil
8 t  Baking powder
-Directions:
Mix the liquids together.  Mix the dry ingredients together. Combine
the two. Roll out using as little flour as possible and cut into
shapes. Do not use the holes again.  Deep fry in hot oil until golden
in color. I don't even bother rolling them out.  Just spoon them into
the hot oil, and then roll them in icing sugar when they come out of
the oil. Takes anywhere from 5-8 minutes.
