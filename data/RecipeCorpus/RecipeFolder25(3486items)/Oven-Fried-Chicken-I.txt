Title: Oven-Fried Chicken I
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
-- dressing mix (dry)
1 ts Seasoned salt
1    Chicken fryer; cut up
3 c  Self-rising flour*
1 tb Paprika
2 pk Lipton Tomato Cup-a-Soup
2 pk Good Seasons Italian
*If self-rising flour is not available, you may use 1 cup all-purpose
flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

In a doubled plastic food bag combine all ingredients, except
chicken, and shake well.  Twist the end of the bag slightly until the
air inside creates an inflated balloon effect.  Spray a jelly roll
pan with Pam or wipe it well with oil.  Run chicken pieces under cold
water and let excess water drip off.  Dredge pieces one at a time in
the bag of seasoned flour, shaking it to coat each piece.  Arrange
the coated pieces, skin-side up, on prepared pan.  Melt 1/4 lb.
margarine or butter and with a pastry brush dab the melted margarine
over the floured surface of the chicken, skin-side only.  When all
the margarine has been used, bake uncovered (without turning) at 350
F. for about 45 minutes to one hour, or until golden brown.

For crispy coating: After applying melted margarine, dust each piece
with more seasoned flour and dab again with additional melted
margarine before baking.
