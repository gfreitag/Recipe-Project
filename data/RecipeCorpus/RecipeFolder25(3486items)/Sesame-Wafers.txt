Title: Sesame Wafers
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 48 cookies
1/2 c  Sesame seeds, toasted
1 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  C&H Golden Brown Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1    Egg; unbeaten
Cream together butter, sugar, and vanilla.  Beat in egg, then stir in
sesame seeds.  Sift together dry ingredients; add to mixture and mix
well. Drop in small, ball-like mounds about 3 inches apart in
well-greased baking sheet.  Bake at 375 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes
(dough will spread, puff up while baking, then sink).  Cool a minute
before removing from sheet. Makes about 4 dozen thin, crisp cookies.

TO TOAST SESAME SEEDS: Spread seeds in shallow pan and set in 375
degree oven until browned (8 to 10 minutes).  Stir often.
