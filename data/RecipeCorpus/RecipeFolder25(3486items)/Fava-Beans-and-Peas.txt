Title: Fava Beans and Peas
Categories: Beans, Side dish, Vegetable
Yield: 1 batch
2    Garlic cloves; minced
1 tb Fresh anise; chopped
Salt and pepper to taste
;Very small amt. of water
-- (about a handful)
2 c  Fresh or frozen fava beans
1 c  Fresh or frozen peas
1 tb Olive oil
1 sm Slice salt pork
-- rind removed
Mince the salt pork.  In a heavy pot, heat the olive oil and add the
salt pork.  Saute until just golden.  Add garlic and saute for a few
minutes. The temperature should be about medium high.  Add the anise
(fennel can be used) and stir to mix all.  Add the fava beans and mix
well. Add salt, pepper and water; cover the pot with a tight fitting
lid. Turn down the heat and let steam cook until tender.  This
doesn't take too long, but I've never timed it so I am only guessing
at about 1/2 hour time. Add the peas; stir to mix well. Cover again
and steam until the peas are done--about ten minutes. Adjust salt and
pepper to your taste and serve with pork chops or steak.

just stock feed...In some Italian deli's and specialty stores, dried
roasted fava beans can be bought. You eat them just like shelled
sunflower seeds. Yum!"
