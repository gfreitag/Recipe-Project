Source: The National Culinary Review, June'94 Edible flowers seem to
be either loved or hated by many of the chefs to whom I have spoken
over the past few months.  As flowers enter their peak season, the
subject of edible flowers in cooking is worthy of discussion in
relation to whether their function is simply to add color (at this
point, the nay-sayers raise their flag due to the minimal flavour
impact that many flowers possess) or scent and flavour as many
regular users suggest. The truth to this matter lies not in how we as
professional chefs feel about using flowers, but in how our customers
precieve and accept them.  Ultimately, as always, reality lies with
customer contact and satisfaction. Some usages for edible flowers in
cooking include; Dry flower petals in vinaigrettes. Ground dry flower
petals in seasoned flour for coating foods. Pureed fresh flowers in
sauces. Flower juice (roses work well) for enhancing broths. Stuffed
flowers (such as squash blossoms). Sweet flower petals in dessert
preparations. Try to use flowers from sources rich in flavour.  James
