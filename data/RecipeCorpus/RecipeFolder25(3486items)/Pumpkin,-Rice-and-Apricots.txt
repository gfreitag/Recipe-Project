Fritschner writes: "In the pumpkin and apricot dish..., the natural
sweetness of pumpkin, dried apricots and onion all play off each
other to make a subtle side dish.  The original recipe came from
Sonia Uvezian's _Cooking from the Caucasus_, which has several
recipes using pumpkin as a savory side dish or addition to a main
dish. It isn't quick to prepare, but it's delicious."
