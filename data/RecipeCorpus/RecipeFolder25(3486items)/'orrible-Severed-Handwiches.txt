Title: 'orrible Severed Handwiches
Categories: Kids, Sandwich
Yield: 10 servings
1 x  Tomato ketchup
1 x  Mayo or similar spread
1 x  Loaf of your favorite
Sandwich bread
10 x  Slices of Ham
You will need a knife and a cutting board. Press your hand on to one
slice of the bread so that it leaves an impression. Cut round the
impression with a sharp knife so that you have a hand shaped piece of
bread. Do the same with the other piece of bread, put spread on one
slice of bread. Rip the slice of ham so that it looks rough at the
edges an place it on the 'hand' of bread. Spread tomato ketchup on to
the 'wrist' and 'fingers' to look like blood. Put the other hand
shapped slice of bread on top to complete the sandwich. You can also
stick 5 almond sliver 'fingernails' on to the ends of the fingers
with ketchup, so that it looks as though blood is oozing out from
underneath. UGH! From: Crazy Cooking (With a name like that, I am not
