Categories: Candy, Nuts/grains, Fruit
Yield: 4 cups
2 tb Orange juice
1 lb Walnut halves
3/4 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Grated orange rind
Pack the walnuts in pretty glass jars tied with decorative ribbons for
gift-giving.  These nuts can be stored in a tightly covered container
at room temperature for up to 3 weeks.  The citrus flavor actually
improves with time.

1.  Preheat oven to 350F.

2.  Combine sugar, salt, orange rind and orange juice in large bowl.
Add walnuts; toss to coat.  Line large jellyroll pan with aluminum
foil. Coat with nonstick vegetable oil cooking spray.  Spread walnuts
evenly over foil.

3.  Bake the walnuts in preheated 350F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or
until dark brown and bubbly, stirring the nuts halfway through.

4.  Meanwhile, coat large piece of aluminum foil with nonstick cooking
spray.  Remove nuts from oven.  Immediately spread on prepared foil,
separating nuts with 2 forks.  Cool completely.  Store in airtight
container(s).

Microwave Directions:  Cook coated walnuts in large microwave-safe
glass baking dish on 100% power for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring every 2
minutes, until dark brown and bubbly.  Proceed with Step 4, above.

Makes 4 1/2 cups.
