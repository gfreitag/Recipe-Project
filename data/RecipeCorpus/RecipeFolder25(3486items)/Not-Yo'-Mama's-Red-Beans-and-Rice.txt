Day 1: Add enough water to the red beans to cover them by 3 or 4
inches, and soak overnight in the refrigerator. As the beans absorb
the water; they'll more than double in volume. Day 2: Combine the
seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl. Drain the beans and set
them aside. Preheat a heavy 5-quart pot, preferrably non-stick, over
high heat to 350 degrees, about 4 minutes. Add 2 CUPS of the onions,
the bell peppers, and the celery, and 1 TABLESPOON of the seasoning
mix. Stir and cook until the vegetables start to turn brown, about 5
minutes. Add 1/2 CUP of the stock, scrape the bottom of the pot to
clear all the browned bits, and cook 3 minutes. Add the REMAINING 1
cup of onions, stir, and cook 5 minutes. Add the drained beans, 5
CUPS of the stock, and the REMAINING seasoning mix. Stir and cook for
45 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally to check for
sticking. Add 1 CUP grape juice and continue to cook for 25 minutes.
CAUTION: At this point, the starches in the beans start to break down
and sticking will occur more often. It is therefore important to
check and clear the bottom of the pan frequently. Add the REMAINING
stock and grape juice, turn the heat to medium, and cook until the
beans are tender, and the liquid is thick and begins to look creamy,
about 30 to 35 minutes. Serve over the rice. Per Serving: Calories

old traditional New Orleans Monday supper dish. Monday used to be
wash day, and the story goes that the beans could simmer while the
laundry was being done. When the wash was finished, so were the
beans. In the past, in order to make the beans really good, the cook
started off with a lot of oil. While this recipe eliminates the oil,
it still is mouth-watering. MAKES ABOUT 7 CUPS, ENOUGH FOR 6
