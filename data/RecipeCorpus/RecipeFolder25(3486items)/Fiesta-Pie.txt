My sister-in-law, Peg, and I spent many hours trying to recreate one
of her favorite desserts: Fiesta Pie from a bakery in Bayonne, New
Jersey. We never recreated it, but we DID surpass it. I offer you:
Paul and Peg's Fiesta Torte. For the crust we use the recipe for
Scottish Shortbread from Fanny Farmer. Spread it into an appropriate
pan, prick with a fork and cook until lightly golden brown. Next we
make a filling. I use commercial vanilla pudding; Peg prefers a
homemade custard (again from Fanny Farmer). When crust is cool,
spread the filling onto it. Slice your favorite fruits in an
attractive pattern. We love to use Kiwi Fruits, bananas, grapes (two
colors if you like), blueberries, strawberries and peaches. The
choice, of course, is up to you. Then we glaze it with a mixture of
currant jelly thinned with orange juice (heated to melt) and enhanced
with a dash of cinnamon and ground ginger. Chill. Try it, you'll love
it.

Of all the dishes I cooked at my recent family reunion, the two that
were requested by all were this one and Cantonese Roast Pork.
