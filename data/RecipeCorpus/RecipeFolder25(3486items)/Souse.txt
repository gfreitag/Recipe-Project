Categories: Meat, Pork, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 servings
4 ea Onions
1 t  Pepper
1 t  Ground allspice
2 c  Vinegar
3 ea Pigs' feet
5 ea Pigs' hocks
1 lb Beef
1 1/2 lb Veal
1 t  Salt
Barely cover meat with water, add salt, and boil until meat is tender
and falls off the bone.  Bone the meat and chop coarsely. Strain the
stock and return it to the pot, along with the onions, pepper, and
allspice. Let it come to a good rolling boil.  Turn off the heat, add
the vinegar, and reserve for pouring over the loaf later. Line a
container with damp cheesecloth large enough to be tied over the top
after it is filled. The bottom layer should be made up of the fattest
pieces and skin, with the leaner pieces in the center of the loaf.
When the bowl is full, strain boiling broth to the top, gather the
edges of the cloth to the center, and tie securely.  Set this
container in a larger one. Place a saucer or lid on the meat and
weight it down heavily with cans of food, filled jars, or a cleanly
wrapped brick. The excess juices will be pressed out into the larger
bowl and can be used in soups or as stock. After unwrapping the
pressed meat, rewrap it in aluminum foil or another nonporous
material and keep it refrigerated. Stocking Up III From the
