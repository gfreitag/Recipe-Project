Title: Whole Wheat I, Abm
Categories: Breadmaker, Bread
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Bread flour
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 c  Nonfat dry milk
1 1/2 ts Yeast
1 c  Water
1/4 c  Margarine/butter
1    Egg
2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
Add ingredients in order recommended by abm manufacturer and press
start.

Deb's notes: I never use a full cup of water. I start out with a
little over 7/8 and add a tb or so until the dough looks right. Add
about 3/4 tb of gluten.
