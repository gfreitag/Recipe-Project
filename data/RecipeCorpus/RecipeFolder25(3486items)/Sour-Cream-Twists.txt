blended. Chill dough 2 hours or until firm enough to handle.

lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a 16-inch long rope.
Cut each rope in 4 pieces.  Bring ends of each piece together,
overlapping them slightly to form a ring.  Place on cookie sheets and
sprinkle with colored sugar.

4.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes until bottoms are lightly browned.  Remove
to wire rack to cool.  Store airtight up to 3 weeks or freeze.
