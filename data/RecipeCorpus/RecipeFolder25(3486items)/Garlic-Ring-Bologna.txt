1/4 ts Ascorbic acid
1/2 ts Saltpeter
4    Feet medium hog casings
2 lb Cubed pork

2 lb Cubed pork fat
5 ts Salt
2 ts Fine grind white pepper
2 ts Crushed mustard seed
Grind pork, veal heart, and fat separately through the fine disk; mix
together with remaining ingredients. Chill, then regrind through the
fine disk. Prepare casings, stuff and tie off into 18" links. Be

the tied ends of each link together and tie securely, forming a ring.

hours, uncovered. Smoke at 110-120 for about two hours. Bring a large
pot of water to a bare simmer (180-190). Simmer rings 20-30 minutes.
when done, they should float to the surface. Cool and store
refrigerated for up to two weeks.
