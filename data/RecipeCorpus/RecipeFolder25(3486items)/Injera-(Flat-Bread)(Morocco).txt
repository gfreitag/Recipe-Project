Title: Injera (Flat Bread)(Morocco)
Categories: African, Bread
Yield: 8 servings
1 ts Baking powder
2 c  Club soda
4 c  Self-rising flour
1 c  Whole wheat flour
Combine flours and baking powder in a bowl. Add club soda plus
about 4 cups water. Mix into a smooth, fairly thin batter. Heat a
large, non-stick skillet. When a drop of water  bounces on the pan's
surface, dip enough batter from the bowl to  cover the bottom of the
skillet, and pour it in quickly, all at once. Swirl the pan so that
the entire bottom is evenly coated,  then set it back on the heat.
When the moisture has evaporated and small holes appear on the
surface, remove the injera. It should be cooked only on one side, and
not too browned. If your first one is a little pasty and under
cooked, you may need to cook a little longer or to make  the next one
thinner. But, as with French crepes, be careful not to cook them too
long, or you'll have a crisp bread that may be  tasty but won't fold
around bits of stew. Stack the injera one on top of the other as you
cook, covering with a clean cloth to prevent their drying out.
