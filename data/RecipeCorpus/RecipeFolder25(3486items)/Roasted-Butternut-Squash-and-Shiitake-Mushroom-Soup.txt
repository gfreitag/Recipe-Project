2 tb Olive oil
1/2 lb Shiitake mushrooms; stemmed
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Drizzle 2 tb. of olive oil over the bottom of

roasted squash pulp, discard skins, and add the pulp to the soup. Let

in a blender or food processor. Return to a clean pot; season with
salt and pepper. Keep warm over low heat.

For the mushroom garnish, heat oil in a medium skillet over medium
high heat.  Add the mushrooms; saute until tender, 7 to 10 minutes.
Stir the mushrooms into the soup; serve hot.
