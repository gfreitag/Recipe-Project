chicken or shellfish. Mix with sour cream or mayonnzise to accompany
grilled meat, poached chicken or baked potatoes. Add to a vinagrette

shredded cooked chicken, chickpeas and avocado cubes to make a zingy
soup or into shrimp or lobster stock with assorted seafood. Mix into
a simple tomato sauce to go with pasta, meatballs, sauted shrimp or
squid, or use as the base for a stew.
