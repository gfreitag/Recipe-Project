-the cream and fold it into
-the nog.
Put the egg nog in a cool
-place (the garage, the
-fridge) and stir
About once a day.  A crust
-will form on the top which
-needs to be
Stirred in.  The nog will
-get better and better with
-time, and will
Keep for weeks.  It will be
-quite harsh for 4-5 days,
-but after that
Will be smooth as silk.
Notice that there are no
-spices.  It really doesn't
-need them, but
You can sprinkle a little
-nutmeg/cloves/cinnamon on
-top as you serve
It, if you like.

Knock-your-socks-off Egg
-Nog (Phil Thwing)
Make this a week or even
-two before you need it!
18 ea Eggs
18 T  Sugar
1 ea Pt white rum
1 qt Whiskey
1 ea Pt whipping cream
Separate eggs.  Beat the
-yolks with the sugar until
-smooth.  Then
Beat in the whiskey VERY
-slowly (this is the
-important step, as
The whiskey is "cooking"
-the eggs; it should take
-30 minutes or
More to get all the whiskey

-added faster
As you proceed.  After the
-whiskey, add the rum. Beat
-the egg

The whites.  Finally whip
MMMMM----------------THIS RECIPE WAS GIVEN ME BY---------------------
1 lg Bottle Myers Planters'
-Punch Rum (or other Extra
-Dark rum)
1 ea Dozen eggs
1 lb Powdered sugar (no,
-*seriously*)
Nutmeg and allspice to taste (no more than 1 tsp nutmeg) 2-3 quarts
milk/cream mix (as rich or as lean as you like) 1 small bottle peach
or apricot brandy (optional) Separate the eggs. Beat the sugar and
the egg yolks well together. Add half the bottle of Myer's rum and
about half the nutmeg you intend to use, cover and refrigerate for at
least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. After refrigerating, add the
rest of the rum, the milk-cream mix, and the apricot/peach brandy (if
desired). (Also if desired, whip the egg whites and fold into the
finished mixture. But in my opinion this makes it *too* bloody thick.
To each his/her own.) Add the rest of the nutmeg and serve.
