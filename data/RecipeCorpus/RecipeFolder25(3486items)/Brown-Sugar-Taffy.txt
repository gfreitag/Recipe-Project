Title: Brown Sugar Taffy
Categories: Candy
Yield: 1 servings
Nuts; chopped
2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Vinegar and water together
Boil as for other taffy until it spins a thread. Add nuts and pour on
plate. Pull when ready. Common walnuts are especially good in this
recipes. Never a failure.

Note: Taffy should be cooked to hard ball stage. Pulling can begin
when it cools enough to handle. Butter hands!
