Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Raspberry Thumbprint Cookies
Categories: Diabetic, Cake/cookie, Fruit
Yield: 3 dozen
2 1/2 c  Brown rice flour
1/2 t  Salt
3    Egg whites
3/4 c  Low sugar raspberry jam
1 1/2 c  Walnuts
1 1/4 c  Butter
5/8 c  Fruit sweetener
3    Egg yolks
1 1/4 t  Vanilla extract
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Toast the walnuts in the preheated
oven for 7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let the nuts cool. Then
process in a food processor, using a pulsing action, until they are
finely ground. Do not overprocess or you will end up with a paste.
Cream together the butter and fruit sweetener until light and fluffy.
Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating well between each addition.
Stir in the vanilla, flour and salt. Cover the dough and refrigerate
for 20 minutes to make it easier to handle. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees. Line baking sheets with baking paper. Use a #24 scoop (2
tablespoons) or a spoon to scoop out the dough and form in into
balls. In a small bowl, stir the egg whites with a fork just to break
them down. Roll the cookie balls in the egg whites. Then drain the
cookies and roll them in the ground walnuts. Place the cookie balls 2
inches apart on the prepared baking pans. Flatten each ball to 1/3
inch thickness. Then press a thumbprint in the center of each cookie.
Fill each indentation with 1 teaspoon of raspberry jam. Bake the
cookies in the preheated oven on an insulated or double pan for 15-18
minutes, until the cookies are golden around their edges. Let the
cookies cook completely on the pans before removing them. As these
are especially fragile when they are warm, handle them with care.
