Categories: Candy, Microwave, Dessert
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Light corn syrup
1 ts Vanilla extract
Food coloring as desired
2 tb Butter
2 ts Butter
2 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
Lightly butter a jelly-roll pan.  In a 3-quart microwave-safe
casserole with high sides, mix sugar, salt, syrup, and 1 cup hot
water. Cook on HIGH until boiling, about 8 minutes.  Stir.  Cook
until mixture reaches 260F on a candy thermometer, about 15 to 20
minutes. When the bubbling stops, stir in 2 tablespoons butter, the
vanilla, and food color. Pour into prepared pan.  Cool about 5
minutes. Lightly butter hands; gather one sixth of taffy into a ball.
Pull until taffy holds its shape in a 1/2-inch thick strand. With
buttered shears, cut into 1-inch lengths. Wrap each piece in plastic
wrap.   Note: Other flavorings can be used. Add according to taste.
Makes 1 1/2 pounds.
