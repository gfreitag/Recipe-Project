Categories: Dip, Meat, Salsa/sauce, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
Oil, preferably canola or
-corn
3 ea To 4 slices bacon, chopped
2 ea Ounces fresh mild goat
-cheese, at room temperature
1 c  Sour cream
1 T  Plus 1 tsp. prepared
-horseradish
1 sl From a medium onion, about
-1/3 inch thick
Potato chips or carrot sticks  Makes about 1-1/2 cups Prepare the
smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200 to 220 F.
Spoon the sour cream and 1 Tbsp. of the horseradish into a smokeproof
baking dish. Rub the onion slice with the oil.  Place the sour cream
and onion in the smoker side by side and cook for 30 to 40 minutes.
The sour cream should be runny but not separated, and the onion well
softened but not cooked through. While the sour cream and onion cook,
fry the bacon in a small skillet. Drain the bacon. Stir the cheese
into the sour cream until well combined. Chop the onion and crumble
the bacon. Mix into the sour cream. Add as much of the remaining
teaspoon of horseradish as desired. The smoked horseradish will
mellow in flavor, and any added at the end create a pleasantly
pungent bite. From: Smoke & Spice by Cheryl Alters Jamison and Bill
