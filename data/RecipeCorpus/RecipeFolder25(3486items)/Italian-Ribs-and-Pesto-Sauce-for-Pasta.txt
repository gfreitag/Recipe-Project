Categories: Italian, Salsa/sauce, Pasta
Yield: 1 servings
2 t  Crushed basil
pn Of oregano
2 cn (29-oz each) tomato sauce
1 cn (8-oz) tomato paste
1 1/2 c  (12-oz) water
1 ea 3-lb slab ribs ****
2 lg Minced onions
1 lg Garlic clove minced
5 ea Anise seeds
1/2 t  Rosemary crushed
1 ea 3-inch piece celery
1 1/2 t  Sugar
**** Cut ribs lengthwise or horizontally, then vertically, in equal
rib-width pieces. In a large, heavy kettle/dutch oven, brown the ribs
well. Pour off fat and set ribs aside. Using a bit of the rib fat,
saute onions and garlic in another skillet until golden and limp.
Don't let them burn. Put ribs in large kettle with onions, garlic,
anise seeds, rosemary, celery, sugar, basil, oregano, tomato sauce,
tomato paste and water. Simmer together, partially covered, until
sauce begins to thicken and mounds. Stir more often as it gets
thicker, this will take about 2 1/2 hours. When sauce is desired
consistency, very thick, and the ribs very, very tender, remove
celery and pour sauce over pasta.
