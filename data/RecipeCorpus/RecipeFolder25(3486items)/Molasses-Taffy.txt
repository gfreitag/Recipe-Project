Title: Molasses Taffy
Categories: Candy
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/3 c  Sugar (clipping says 1 1-3
-c. sugar..)
1 c  Water
4 tb Butter
2/3 c  Molasses. (clipping has 2-3,
-but I think it's 2/3)
Notes: From Ruby Williams' file; newspaper clipping. Date unknown
('50s? earlier?)

Put butter in saucepan and when melted add sugar, molasses and water.
Stir until sugar is dissolved, and let boil without stirring until
mixture will form a very soft ball that will just keep its shape when
tried in cold water.  Turn out on a cold platter or agate tray, and
as mixture cools around sides fold toward center.  When cool enough
to handle, pull until porous and light colored with tips of fingers
and thumbs. Be careful not to squeeze it in the hand.  Cut in small
pieces with large scissors or a sharp knife and arrange on slightly
buttered plates, or wrap in wax paper. A few srops of oil of
peppermint, clove or cinnamon may be added during the pulling.
