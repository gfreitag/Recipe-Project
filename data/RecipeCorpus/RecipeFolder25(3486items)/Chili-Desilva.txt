Title: Chili Desilva
Categories: Ground beef, Chili
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Paprika
3 tb Cumin
2 ts Chipenos (pequin chiles)
4 ds Liquid hot pepper sauce
30 oz Tomato sauce
6 oz Tomato paste
Water
4 tb Corn flour (masa harina)
2 tb Vegetable oil
5    Onions
4 lb Ground beef chuck
5    Garlic cloves
4 tb Oregano
2 ts Woodruff
1 tb Ground red hot chili
1 ts Cayenne pepper
Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the
onions. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until the
onions are translucent. Remove to a large heavy pot. Add the meat to
the skillet, pouring in more oil if necessary. Add garlic and 1
tablespoon of the oregano. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook
over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the meat is
evenly browned. Add this mixture to the pot. In a small plastic or
paper bag, shake together the remaining 3 tablespoons of oregano, the
woodruff, ground chile, cayenne pepper, paprika, cumin, and the
chipenos. Add the blended spices to the pot as well as the liquid hot
pepper sauce, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. Add enough water to
cover. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered,
for at least 2 hours. Taste and adjust seasonings. Cool the chili and
refrigerate it overnight. The next day, skin off the excess fat.
Reheat the chili to the boiling point and stir in a paste made of the
masa harina and a little water. Stir constantly to prevent sticking
and scorching, adding water as necessary for the desired texture.
