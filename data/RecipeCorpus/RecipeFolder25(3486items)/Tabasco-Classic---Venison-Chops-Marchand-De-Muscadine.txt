Title: Tabasco Classic - Venison Chops Marchand De Muscadine
Categories: Game, Cajun/creol, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Sliced Green Onions
1 c  Dry White Wine
1/2 c  Muscadine Jelly
1/4 ts Salt
Chopped Fresh Parsley
8    Venison Chops, 4 Ounces Each
1 1/4 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce
Salt
1/4 lb Butter Or Margarine, Soften
1 tb Vegetable Oil
Avery Island and the country around it abound in game, especially wild
ducks and geese, snipe, woodcock, doves and deer.  We age our venison
for at least four weeks and cook it rare.  We use muscadine jelly
from Callaway Gardens for our sauce, but you can use any flavorful
fruit jelly, such as grape or guava.
Season the chops with 1 teaspoon of the Tabasco sauce and sprinkle
them with salt.  In a large skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter
and the oil over medium-high heat.  In two batches, cook the chops
for 5 minutes, turning once, and remove to a warm platter.

Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in the same skillet.  Add the green
onions and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes, or until tender.
Stir in the wine.  Bring to a boil and boil rapidly to reduce to 1/2
cup. Stir in the jelly until it is melted.  Add the remaining 1/4
teaspoon Tabasco sauce and salt to taste.  Remove from the heat. Stir
in the remaining 5 tablespoons butter, a tablespoon at a time, until
the sauce is slightly thickened. Serve over the chops. Sprinkle with
parsley.
