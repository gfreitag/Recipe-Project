Title: Flour Tortillas 2
Categories: Tex/mexican, Bread
Yield: 12 tortillas
2/3 c  Shortening
1 c  Plus 3 Tb
-- hot water
4 c  Flour
2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Baking powder
Combine flour, salt and baking powder; stir well.  Cut in shortening
with pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Gradually
stir in water, mixing well. Put an ungreased skillet over medium heat
so that the tortillas can be cooked as soon as they are rolled out.
Shape dough into 1 1/2 inch balls; place in a bowl covered with a
damp towel to keep moist. Roll each out on a lightly floured surface
into a very thin circle. Circles should be about 6 inches in
diameter. Place tortilla on hot skillet and cook about two minutes on
each side, until lightly brown. Serve hot.
