Title: Salsa De Chile Rojo (Red Chili Sauce)
Categories: So. america, Salsa/sauce, Condiment, Tex/mexican
Yield: 2 cups
1/4 ts Garlic; finely chopped
1/4 c  Olive oil; or vegetable oil
1 tb Fresh parsley; finely
Chopped
1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Black pepper; freshly ground
1 tb Red wine vinegar
5    Dried ancho chilies
1 c  Boiling water
1    Dried pequin chili; crumbled
3 md Tomatoes; peeled, seeded and
Coarsely chopped (see Salsa
Cruda) or substitute 1 cup
Drained, canned Italian plum
Tomatoes
1/2 c  Onions; coarsely chopped
Under cold running water, pull the stems off the ancho chilies,
tear them in half and brush out their seeds.  With a small, sharp
knife, cut away any large ribs.  Tear the chilies into small pieces
and place them in a bowl. Pour 1 cup of boiling water over them and
let the soak for 30 minutes. Then combine the ancho chilies, 1/4 cup
of their soaking water, the pequin chili, tomatoes, onions and garlic
in the jar of a blender. Blend at high speed for 1 minute, or until
the mixture is reduced to a smooth puree.

NOTE:   (To make the sauce by hand, puree the chilies, tomatoes,
onions and garlic in a food mill set over a bowl.  Discard any pulp
left in the mill.  Stir 1/4 cup of chili soaking water onto the puree
and mix well.)

In an 8 to 10 inch skillet, heat the oil over moderate heat.  Add
the puree and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.
Stir in the parsley, sugar, salt and pepper, remove the skillet from
the heat, and add the vinegar.  Salsa de Chile Rojo is traditionally
served with cooked meats and tortilla dishes.  It keeps, covered and
refrigerated, for 3 to 4 days.
