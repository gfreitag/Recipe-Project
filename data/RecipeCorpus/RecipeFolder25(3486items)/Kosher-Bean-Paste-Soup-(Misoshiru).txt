Title: Kosher Bean Paste Soup (Misoshiru)
Categories: Soup/stew, Jewish, Japanese, Beans, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
Makes 1 Quart
Miso, a red paste made from fermented soybeans, is added dashi to
make a flavorful soup served by the Japanese at breakfast and at
other meals. The bean paste both thickens the broth and gives it a
lovely reddish-brown hue. Miso is very salty, so add a tablespoon at
a time, and taste after each addition. 4 c Dashi (see previous
recipe) 2 to 4 tb Miso; to taste OPTIONAL: 1/2 c  Tofu Cubes
(1/4-inch cubes) In a 2-quart pot, heat the dashi to boiling, then
reduce to a simmer. In a small bowl, stir the miso with a fork until
smooth. Blend the miso into the soup a tablespoon at a time, tasting
after each addition. Add the tofu cubes and serve. The miso has a
tendency to separate and give the soup a curdled appearance, so stir
the soup before serving. From: International Cooking For The Kosher
