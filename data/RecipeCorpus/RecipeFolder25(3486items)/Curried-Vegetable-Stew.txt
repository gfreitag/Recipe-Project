Helpful hints:  Serve with a garnish of yogurt and cilantro over
millet or rice. Place leftover stew in single serving plastic
containers with tight fitting lids, and freeze for up to 1 month.  To
reheat, defrost for at least 2 hours in the frig.  Wrap in aluminum
foil and bake at 350 for 20-30 mins, or place in bowl, cover and
reheat in microwave on med for 3 mins. Posted by Lisa Greenwood
