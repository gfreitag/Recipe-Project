Title: Hazruquive
Categories: Native amer, Soup/stew, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
3    Ears yellow corn on the cob,
-cut into 3-to 4-inch pieces
2    Bunches bean or sunflower
-sprouts
2 c  Cooked Indian Hominy
3 c  Veal stock
1 tb Salt
1 ts Black pepper
Place the hominy in a large saucepan with enough water to cover.
Bring to a noil over high heat and add the veal stock, salt, and
pepper. Return to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, and cook 10
minutes.

Add the corn and continue cooking 10 minutes longer, or until the
corn is tender.

Add the bean sprouts, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until they
also are tender, 5 to 10 minutes.

Serve hot.  Customarily the corn is eaten with the hands, and the
hominy and broth are eaten with a spoon.  Hazruquive tastes wonderful
with Piki Bread or other breads. ************************** This
recipe is based on a traditional Hopi dish made once a year, on the
day of the Powanu Ceremony, or Bean Dance, in late winter when the
land is in the period of its deepest dormancy.  It is on this day
that the Kachinas carry a basket full of bean sprouts that have
somehow grown during the dark, cold days of winter.

The Bean Dance is a formal prayer to the Kachinas on behalf of the
seeds that will be planted as soon as the frozen ground thaws and
spring, which signifies life, arrives.

I have adapted this recipe for the modern kitchen using fresh corn
because dried corn on the cob is not readily available commercially;
however, the essence of the dish remains traditional.
