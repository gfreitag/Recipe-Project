Title: Aunt Jemima Maple Syrup (Ts)
Categories: Syrup, Breakfast, Pancakes
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 t  Salt
1 t  Maple flavoring
2 c  Water
1 c  Sugar
2 c  Dark corn syrup
Combine the first 4 ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir
occasionally, until the mixture comes to a full boil. Let it boil for
7 minutes.  Turn the heat off and let the syrup cool for 15 minutes.
Add the maple flavoring and stir. When completely cool, transfer the
syrup to a covered plastic or glass container. Note: For a syrup with
a butter flavor, just add 3 Tbsp. of butter to the mixture before
heating. For a lighter syrup, use a sugar substitute instead of the
sugar. The absence of natural maple syrup in this recipe is not
unusual. In fact, there is no real maple syrup in any Aunt Jemima
syrups. Makes: 1 quart From: "Top Secret Recipes" Cookbook Posted by:
