Spread out dough on pizza pan.  In medium bowl, mix apple pie filling
with cinnamon and cloves.  Spread over pizza dough.  Sprinkle grated
cheese over top of pie filling.  Bake in 375-385F oven for approx

This makes a GREAT get together snack for teenagers.  Is cheap and
very easy to make, and the kids think it is WONDERFUL!!  8-} Origin:
