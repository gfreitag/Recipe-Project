"This is a lighthearted version of riz a l'imperatrice -- "rice in the
style of the empress" - which is thought to have been inspired by
Empress Eugenie, the Spanish wife of Napolean."

Bring 2 tablepsoons dried currants and brandy to boil in small
saucepan. Remove mixture from heat.  Combine 1-1/2 cups water, rice
and salt in another small saucepan.  Bring to boil, stirring
occasionally. Reduce heat to low.  Cook uncovered until almost all
water is absorbed and rice is very soft, stirring occasionally, about
20 minutes.

Place 2 cups milk in heavy medium saucepan; sprinkle gelatin over
milk. Let stand 10 minutes to soften.

Heat milk mixture over low heat until just warm, stirring until
gelatin dissolves.  Add currant mixture, rice, sugar, orange peel and
cinnamon. Cook over low heat until mixture thickens slightly,
stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes; do not boil.  Whisk egg and
vanilla in medium bowl to blend.  Mix 1/2 cup of hot rice mixture
into egg. Return egg mixture to saucepan and stir over very low heat
3 minutes; do not boil. Remove mixture from heat.

Place saucepan in bowl of ice water.  Stir pudding occasionally until
cool. Spoon into four 3/4-cup custard cups.  Refrigerate until set,
at least 8 hours.
