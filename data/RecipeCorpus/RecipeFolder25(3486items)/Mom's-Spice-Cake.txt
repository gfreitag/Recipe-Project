Title: Mom's Spice Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert
Yield: 1 cake
1/2 t  Cloves
1 t  Nutmeg
1 t  Allspice
1/4 t  Ground ginger
1 c  Milk
1 c  Chopped nutmeats
1 c  Floured "white" raisins
1/2 c  Shortening
1 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
2 c  Flour
1/4 t  Salt
1/4 t  Baking soda
1 t  Baking powder
1 t  Cinnamon
blend shortening, sugar, and eggs.

sift together flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and spices.

Add milk to egg mixture, then gradually add flour mixture, nutmeats
and raisins.

Bake for 1 hour at 325degF.

Mom always used an old-style "tube pan".  She always said the raisins
were "optional", but I found it too dry without the raisins.

Tip: plump up the raisins by soaking in warm water 1/2 hr prior to
flouring them.
