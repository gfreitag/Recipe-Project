Title: Someviki with Red Chile Sauce
Categories: Native amer, Pasta, Main dish
Yield: 10 servings
2 c  Finely ground blue cornmeal
1/2 c  Sugar
Red Chile Sauce
30    Dried corn husks
5 tb Culinary ash *OR*
2 ts Baking soda
2 c  Boiling water
Soak the corn husks in very hot water for 10 to 15 minutes until they
are soft and pliable.

Mix the culinary ash with 1/2 cup of the boiling water and set aside.

Mix the blue cornmeal and sugar together in a bowl.  Add the remaining
boiling water and stir until the mixture is thick.

Pour the ash-water through a fine strainer, discard ash.  Add the
ash-water to the cornmeal mixture, small amounts at a time, while
stirring to make the dough.  It will turn a distinctive blue color
and should have the consistency of a thick cake batter.

Spoon 1 tablespoon of the dough onto each corn husk and fold the husk
around the dough, first the sides and then the ends.  Tear long, thin
strands from another husk and tie each bundle to secure the dough
inside. (If you find the corn husk strands too difficult to
manipulate, use string instead)

Bring a large pot of water to a boil, drop the wrapped husks into the
water and simmer 10 minutes.  Once the husks have plumped, remove
them from the water and drain.  Serve with Red Chile Sauce.  Untie
corn husks after serving so that the dumplings stay hot.
*************** Someviki are sweet blue cornmeal dumplings similar to
the blue corn dumplings. They are wrapped in corn husks, tied, and
boiled until cooked.
