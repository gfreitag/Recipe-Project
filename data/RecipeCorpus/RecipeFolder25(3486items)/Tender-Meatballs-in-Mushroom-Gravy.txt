Pull apart bread into small, dime-size pieces. Combine ground beef,
bread, salt, pepper, and minced onion in a large mixing bowl. Using a
spoon, scoop out rounds of meat mixture, or shape into several round,
2-inch balls by hand. Brown meatballs in a hot skillet using a small
amount of butter or oil. Turn them occasionally so all sides are
browned. Place meatballs in a crockpot. Add soup and water. Cook on
low for 6 to 12 hours, high for up to 6 hours. Roy North Beach
