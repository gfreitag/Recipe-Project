There is nothing subtle about Creole sausages. They are hot and
spicy, full of onions and garlic, seasoned lavishly with red peppers,
and tasting of parsley, bayleaves and allspice. Creole sausages are
served as breakfast sausage and they are used in jambalayas and
gumbos. In this recipe, ground beef substitutes for the pork and pork
fat used in New Orleans, but the herbs and spices remain the same so
you can expect the meat to have the flavor of the authentic sausages.
1 lb Beef; ground; not too lean 1/3 c Onion; chopped 1 ea Garlic
Clove 1/4 ts Cayenne Pepper; ground 1/4 ts Chili Powder 1/4 ts Red
Pepper; crushed 1/2 ts Salt 1/2 ts Black Pepper; freshly ground 1/2
ts Thyme; dried 2 tb Parsley; fresh; chopped 1 sm Bay Leaf; crushed
pn Allspice; ground

Combine all the ingredients, mixing very well. If you house is not too
warm, allow the mixture to remain at room temperature for an hour or
two to blend the flavors. Wrap well and refrigerate until ready to
use, up to 2 days. The sausage can be frozen, although you might lose
a little of the spiciness during storage. Use as directed in other
recipes, or shape into patties and grill, broil, or fry in a little
oil until brown on both sides and cooked through. Makes about 1
pound. From: International Cooking For The Kosher Home By: Betty S.
