Title: Micro-Stewed Chicken for Deboning
Categories: Poultry, Microwave, Chicken, Soup/stew
Yield: 3 cups
1    Carrot sliced
1    Rib celery with leaves, cut
-into 2" pieces
1    Bay leaf
1    Broiler-fryer chicken, cut
-up
Water to cover
1    Onion, quartered
Rinse fryer parts and place in a 4-quart casserole or simmer pot.
Cover chicken with hot tap water. Add onion, carrot, celery and bay
leaf; cover. Rearranging parts midway through cooking, microwave on
high 30-40 minutes.

Let chicken stand, covered, 10-15 minutes to complete carry-over
cooking. Using tongs, remove parts from liquid and place on a platter
until cool enough to handle. Meat is easier to debone while still
warm. Remove meat from bones and chop coarsely. Use in any recipe
calling for cooked chicken meat. Discard bay leaf.

Pour broth into jars and let cool. Fat can be skimmed from top after
it solidifies. Cover and refrigerate; use or freeze within two days.
Yields 3 cups deboned chicken and 1 1/2 quarts broth.
