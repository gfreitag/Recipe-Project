Title: Zabaglione (Wine-Flavored Custard)
Categories: Dessert, Alcohol, Italian
Yield: 6 servings
1/3 c  Medium white wine
6    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Sugar
Beat egg yolks with electric mixer in top of double boiler until
foamy. Beat in sugar gradually.

Pour just enough hot water in bottom of double boiler so that top
part does not touch water. (Water in double boiler should not boil.)
Cook egg yolks over medium heat; mix in wine slowly, beating on high
speed until smooth, pale and thick enough to stand in soft mounds.
Serve immediately in shallow stemmed glasses.
