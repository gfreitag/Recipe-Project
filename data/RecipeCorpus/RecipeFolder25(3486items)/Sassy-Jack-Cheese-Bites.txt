Helpful hints:  Freeze cheese balls at least a few hours before
baking. Freezing allows cheese to harden so balls hold their shape in
the oven. Unbaked cheese balls may be kept in the freezer in a
tightly covered container for up to 2 weeks.

VT's note:  These spicy little morsels are so easy to assemble that
making them is almost as much fun as eating them!  Mix them up,
freeze and they're ready when you are.
