(A Master Recipe for Chunky and Pureed Soup)

Heat oil in a large soup kettle. Add onions, carrots and celery. Saut
until vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saut until
fragrant, about 1 minute. Add stock and simmer 1 to 2 minutes, then
add other vegetables and seasoning as you like.

For a chunky vegetable soup, keep the ratio of vegetables to liquid at
about one-and-one-quarter pounds per quart, and always include some
carrots, onions and celery.

For pureed soups, use a one-half pound of the onion-carrot-celery
trinity (Twice as much onions and carrots as celery), one and
one-half pounds of the featured vegetable, and one pound of potatoes
to one and one-half quarts of liquid.

Note: chilling reduces herbs and spices to dormancy, so use a heavier
hand if you're planning a cold soup.
