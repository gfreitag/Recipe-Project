Title: Chocolate Yeast Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Chocolate
Yield: 1 cake
3    Eggs
6 oz Semi-sweet chocolate; melted
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Vanilla
3/4 c  Milk
2 pk Yeast
1/4 c  Water; very warm
3 c  All-purpose flour; sifted
1/2 c  Butter
2 c  Sugar
Preheat oven to 350F at least 20 minutes before starting. Scald the
milk; cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle or crumble the yeast into the very
warm water in a small mixer bowl. Stir until dissolved. Add the milk
and 1 1/2 cups flour.  Beat at medium speed until smooth, about 30
seconds.  Cover; let rise in a warm place, free from draft, until
light and spongy, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place the butter and
sugar in a large mixer bowl. Cream well at medium speed.  Add the
eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add the yeast
mixture and remaining ingredients; beat until well blended, about 1
minute.  Turn into a well greased 10" tube pan. Cover; let rise in a
warm place, free from draft, until light and bubbly, about 1 hour.
Bake in a moderate oven (350F) for about 50 minutes.
