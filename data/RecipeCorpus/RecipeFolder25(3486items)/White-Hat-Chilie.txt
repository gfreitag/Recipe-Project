cooked rice.

Options:  use 1/4 cup picante instead of chilies, or prepare a
packaged soup mix to substitute for caned soup.

From the "Mr.Food" television program * The original recipe called
for 1/2 tsp of cumin.  Ridiculous!  I never used that little cumin in
anything in my life!

** It called for 2 chicken breasts -- I used 3 (they were thawed
out... had to use them... besides, they were small.

*** It specified "White Pinto Beans"  or Cannellini (White Kidney
Beans) a Sunday morning run to two grocery stored here in
America's Outback revealed -- they ain't got such an animal. So
I used a can of Great Northern's -- only other time I have used
G/Ns has been in ham 'n beans and then it was the dry beans.
Never bought a "can" of 'em before.

**** Initially I only used 1 cn of peppers.  It called for two.
Will probably need to heat it up a bit more later.  (Yes, here
in the Outback the variety of peppers (either fresh or dried)
is extremely limited. posted with trepidation by Bud Cloyd From:
