Title: Keen-Tucky Coleslaw
Categories: Salad, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
No Ingredients Found
Slice enough cabbage, paper thin, that you have 6 cups (1 lg. head?).
Toss lightly with 1/4 cup sugar, and 1 cup finely shredded carrots.
Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper, and drench it all
with 1/2 cup milk.  Cover and refrigerate for about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile,

combine 1 cup mayonnaise (NOT salad dressing), 1/2 cup dairy
buttermilk, 1/2 tsp. celery seed, 2 or 3 drops hot pepper sauce, and
3 Tbsp. dry minced onion.  Mix well with cabbage mixture.
Refrigerate again at least an hour before serving.  Drain some of the
dressing first and serve it separately at the table.  The coleslaw
does settle quite a bit during refrigeration. It keeps for 24 hours
ONLY. From: Rich Harper - Cooking Echo Makes: Enough for 6 to 8
