Title: Kasha Varnishkas
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1 1/2 c  Bowtie noodles, cooked and
-drained
2 tb Margarine
2 tb Shmaltz
1    Onion, diced
1 c  Diced mushrooms (optional)
1 c  Medium grain kasha
1    Egg, beaten
2 c  Boiling water, or soup stock
Heat the shmaltz in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat.  Saute onion
and mushrooms (if used) until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Add the
kasha to the beaten egg, and mix well.  Stir this mixture into the
onion mixture and saute for 2 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon
until the grains are separate.

At the same time, in a 1-quart saucepan, bring liquid to a boil. Pour
the noiling liquid over kasha, add seasonings, and simmer covered for
10 to 15 minutes until the kasha has absorbed all the liquid and is
dry and fluffy.

In a serving bowl, combine drained noodles with kasha while both are
still warm.  Melt in 2 tablespoons of margarine and stir until
everything is well combined.  Serve warm.
