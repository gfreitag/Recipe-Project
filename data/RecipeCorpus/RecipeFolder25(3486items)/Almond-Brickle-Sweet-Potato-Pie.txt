Bake scrubbed sweet potatoes at 350 F. for about one hour or until
soft. Peel and mash.  This should yield 2 1/2 cups. Put 1/2 cup
brickle bits in a spice grinder or food processor and process until
finely crushed. Combine with flour and salt in a bowl. Cut in the
butter and shortening until coarse crumbs form.  Stir in enough ice
water to make a dough. Chill 30 minutes. Roll 2/3 of the dough into
an 11" circle. Fit into a 9" pie plate and trim the edges. Use the
remaining dough to form a rope edge to the crust.  Line the crust
with foil and weight with dried beans.  Bake about 10 minutes at 425
F., or until light golden.  Remove beans and foil. Cool crust on a
rack.  Reset oven to 350 F. Combine sweet potatoes with the
half-and-half, eggs, rum, sugars, melted butter, nutmeg, and mace in
a food processor.  Process until smooth. Pour into the cooled pie
crust and bake for 35 minutes. Combine the remaining 1/3 cup candy
with the sliced almonds.  At the end of 35 minutes, sprinkle this
mixture around the edge of the pie. Continue baking pie 20 minutes
more, or until a knife tests clean. Cool pie, then refrigerate 2
hours or overnight. Let set at room temperature for 30 minutes before
serving.  Garnish with whipped cream if desired. Mensa Food SIG
