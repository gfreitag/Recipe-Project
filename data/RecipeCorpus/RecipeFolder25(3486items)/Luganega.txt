Title: Luganega
Categories: Pork, Sausage, Homemade, Italian
Yield: 4 pounds
1 ts Grated lemon peel
1 ts Grated orange peel
1 ts Finely ground black pepper
1 cl Garlic, very finely chopped
1 1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
1/2 c  Dry vermouth
4    Feet medium hog casings
3 1/2 lb Lean pork butt, cubed
1/2 lb Pork fat, cubed
1 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 ts Freshly ground nutmeg
1/2 ts Finely ground coriander
Grind pork and fat together through the fine disk and mix with
remaining ingredients. Prepare casings, stuff and twist off into
8-10" lengths. Separate the links and allow them to dry in a cool
place 2-3 hours. Refrigerate and use within two or three days or
freeze. The flavor of the orange and lemon is intensified by freezing
and is best used fresh.
