Title: Moroccan "Yogurt" (Raipe)
Categories: Dessert, Moroccan, Vegetable
Yield: 8 servings
-- more or less; to taste
1/4 c  Orange flower water
-- up to 1/2 cup; to taste
10    Coques or wild artichokes*
2 qt Fresh milk
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
*Cynara humilis.

Break off the outer leaves of the coques and trim carefully - they
are very spiky.  Remove the base and set the chokes aside.  (If
desired, let the chokes dry in the sun for a few days, then crumble
them and pack them in a cheesecloth bag).

Heat the milk, with the sugar, to lukewarm.

Pound the hairy chokes to a pulp in the mortar.  Wrap the pulp in
cheesecloth and swirl around in the lukewarm milk, then gently
squeeze the bag to extract all the brown juice.  Remove and discard
the bag, and stir the orange flower water into the milk.  Cover and
set in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until set.  Serve cool or
chilled in cups.

Wolfert writes: "Raipe is a type of sweetened junket or 'yogurt' in
which the milk thickens and 'firms up' on account of a most unusual
ingredient: the hairy centers, or 'chokes,' of wild Moroccan
artichokes. Unfortunately these wild artichokes, called coques by the
Moroccans, are not available here, but if you get to Morocco and find
ten or so of them you should not hesitate to let the chokes dry in
the sun, bring them home, and make raipe - it's simple to prepare and
absolutely delicious."
