Sometimes people are disappointed with the beef they buy because it
has not been properly aged.  While aging beef is a simple porcess, it
is expensive beacues it requires that producers store meat for at
least 21 days at 34F-38F.  Only the top grades of beef - Prime and
Choice - can be aged, because they have a substantial layer of fat on
the outside the keeps the meat inside from spoiling during the aging
process.  Merle Ellis's friend, Al Cooper, shared with Merle the
secret of how to age beef in the refrigerator.  Buy a rib-eye or loin
strip on sale - either Prime or Choice.  Take the meat out of the
plastic wrap and rinse it with cold water.  Let it drain, then pat it
dry with paper towels.  Wrap the meat in a large white cotton dish
towel and place the package on the bottom shelf of your refrigerator.
The next day, unwrap the meat and wrap it in a fresh towel.  Continue
changing the towel as often as necessary for 10-14 days - and you are
ready to start enjoying good steaks. Cut steaks from each end as
needed and let the remaining meat continue to age in the
refrigerator. Or, if you eat steak rarely, cut the entire piece of
aged meat into steaks, wrap each one in heavy duty plastic wrap, and
freeze until ready to use. Don't forget to label them with the date.
To clean the dishtowels, soak each one as you finish using it in cold
water overnight. Next, soak the towels in cold salt water for 2-3
hours, and then launder as usual. Origin: Cooking with Regis & Kathie
