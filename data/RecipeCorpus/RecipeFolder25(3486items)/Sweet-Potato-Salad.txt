Title: Sweet Potato Salad
Categories: Salad, Vegetable
Yield: 2 servings
1 c  Diced red bell peppers
Salt to taste
Ground black pepper to taste
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1    Scallion, thinly sliced
Salad greens
1/2 c  Ricotta cheese (opt)
2 lg Sweet potatoes, peeled and
-cut into 1/4" cubes (~3c)
1 1/2 tb Wine or cider vinegar
1 1/2 tb Dijon mustard
1 tb Honey
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 c  Diced celery
Steam the sweet potato cubes for 6-8 minutes, until just tender.

Take care not to overcook them. While the potatoes steam, whisk the
vinegar, mustard and honey in a small bowl. Slowly add the oil in a
thin stream, whisking until the dresing emulsifies. Place the diced
celery and red peppers in a serving bowl. Add the steamed potatoes
and the dressing. Stir gently, add salt and pepper to taste, and set
aside for a few minutes. When the salad has cooled a little, toss in
the parsley and scallions.

Serve on crisp salad greens, topped with dollop of ricotta, if you
like. (If you use the ricotta, you may wish to add another scallion
and additional salt and pepper.) Makes two 8-oz servings.
