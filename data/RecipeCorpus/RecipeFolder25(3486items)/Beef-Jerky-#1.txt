Title: Beef Jerky #1
Categories: Can/preserv, Beef, Information
Yield: 20 servings
1/2 t  Ground ginger
1/4 t  Ground red pepper
1/4 t  Ground black pepper
1 T  Onion powder
1    Clove garlic, smashed
3 lb Rump roast (or similar cut)
1/2 c  Light Japanese soy sauce
-I use Kikkomon
1/4 c  Worchestershire sauce
1/4 c  White vinegar
1 c  Water
have the butcher cut your roast in 1/8 inch slice against the grain.
OR do it at home.  if you don't have good cutlery, have the butcher
do it. it won't be worth it!

cut off the slice of fat on the bottom.  separate the two distinct
sinews. (you can tell, the grain goes one way on one, and the other
way on the other).  Trim out the "gristle" that is between them.
slice the two sinews against the grain into 1/8 inch slices.

Mix the soya, and remaining ingredients to make the marinade.
Marinade the meat slices for 6 or 8 hours in the fridge. (I usually
place in a ziploc type bag, and place in a bowl--turning a couple of
times to be sure all the slices get an equal chance at the marinade)

Note: I use the smoke very spareingly,  I've used as much as a 1/4
teas. (10 drops) in this recipe.  Any more is too much IMHO. But you
might use more if you really like smoke, but a little goes a long
way. I prefer Japanese soya, cuz it's lighter than the Chinese soya.
And I get the Light Japanese soya, which has significantly less salt.
You could add more red pepper if you like it spicey or use fresh
ginger instead of bottled. If you like it sweeter, replace the water
with a cup of Vermont maple syrup. Also when choosing your roast, the
leaner, the better.
