peppercorns. Shape the meat mixture into balls about 2 inches in
diameter. Add to the boiling broth and simmer over low heat for 20
minutes. Remove meatballs with a slotted spoon, set aside, and keep
warm. Gravy: To prepare gravy, heat butter in a frypan and stir in
flour.  Cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Slowly blend in 2
cups of reserved broth. Add the drained capers, lemon juice, and
mustard. Simmer for 5 minutes. Remove a small amount of the sauce to
blend with the egg yolk.  Stir egg yolk back into the sauce. Season
with salt and pepper. To Serve: Place reserved meatballs into the
gravy and reheat if necessary.  Serve on a preheated platter.
