Categories: Can/preserv, Fruit
Yield: 1 batch
-pectin
2 tb Lemon juice
6 c  Sugar
10 lg Pomegranates
3 oz Pouch liquid pectin or
1    Box (1 3/4 or 2 oz.) dry
To extract juice, cut crowns off pomegranates and score peel of each
in several places.  Immerse pomegranates, one at a time, in cool
water in a large bowl; break into sections and separate seeds. Skim
off floating peel and membrane; discard.  Drain seeds.

In a 5 to 6-quart kettle on high heat, combine seeds and 1/2 c. water.
Cover and cook until seeds are soft when pressed, about 10 minutes.

Set colander lined with cheesecloth in a bowl.  Pour in seeds and
liquid. Tie cloth closed.  Wearing rubber gloves, squeeze bag to
extract remaining juice.  Measure; you need exactly 4 cups (if amount
is short, add water).

If using liquid pectin, combine pomegranate juice, lemon juice and
sugar in an 8 to 10-quart kettle; bring to a boil over medium-high
heat. Add liquid pectin and bring to a boil that cannot be stirred
down. Boil, stirring, for exactly 1 minute.

If using dry pectin, combine pomegranate juice, lemon juice and
pectin. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Stir in sugar and
bring to a boil that cannot be stirred down; boil, stirring, exactly
2 minutes.

Pour hot jelly to within 1/4" of rim of hot, sterilized, 1 or 2-cup
canning jars.  Wipe rims and put hot lids and rings in place. Set
jars on a rack in a deep kettle; add boiling water to cover. Bring to
simmering; simmer 10 minutes.  Cool jars on a towel for 2 days.

Yield: About 7 cups.
