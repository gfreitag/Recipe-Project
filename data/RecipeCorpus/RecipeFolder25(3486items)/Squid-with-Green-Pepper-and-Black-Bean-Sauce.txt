Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Main dish, Vegetable
Yield: 1 batch
1 tb Finely chopped scallions
1 ts Salt
1 tb Black bean sauce
1 tb Chinese rice wine or
1 tb Dry sherry
Few drops of sesame oil
12    To 14 oz. squid
1 md Green bell pepper
-- cored and seeded
3    To 4 tb. vegetable oil
1    Garlic clove; finely chopped
1/2 ts Finely chopped fresh ginger
To clean the squid, discard the head, transparent backbone and ink
bag. Peel off and discard the skin, then wash the squid and dry well.
Open up the squid and, with a sharp knife, score the inside of the
flesh in a criss-cross pattern.  Cut the squid into pieces each about
the size of an oblong postage stamp.  Blanch the squid in a pan of
boiling water for a few seconds.  Remove and drain; dry well.

Cut the green pepper into small triangular pieces.  Heat the oil in a
wok and stir fry the green pepper for about 1 minute.  Add garlic,
ginger, scallions, salt and squid; continue stirring for another
minute. Finally add the black bean sauce and wine or sherry; blend
well. Sprinkle with sesame oil and serve.
