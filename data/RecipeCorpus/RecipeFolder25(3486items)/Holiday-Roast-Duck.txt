large roasting pan, surround with sliced onions and carrots. Roast 15
minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Turn ducks on one
side and roast 20 minutes, removing fat from pan occasionally. Turn
ducks on second side and roast 20 minutes removing fat from pan
occasionally. Arrange breast side up in pan, brush ducks with orange
sauce generously. Cook until duck juices run clear when ducks are
pierced in thick part of thighs about 25 minutes. For crisper skin,
preheat broiler. Broil ducks until crisp. Watch them carefully.

desired. (discard onions) When ducks are carved, serve with orange
sauce.
