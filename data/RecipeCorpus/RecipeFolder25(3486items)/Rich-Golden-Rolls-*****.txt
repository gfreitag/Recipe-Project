Title: Rich Golden Rolls *****
Categories: Bread
Yield: 32 rolls
3 pk Yeast; dry or compressed
1/2 c  Water; warm
2    Eggs
4 1/2 c  Flour; sifted
1/2 c  Milk
1/3 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 c  Butter
Preheat oven to 400F about 20 minutes before the rolls are ready to
bake.

Scale the milk; add the sugar, salt and butter.  Cool to lukewarm. In
a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water.  Add the lukewarm milk
mixture, eggs and half the flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough
remaining flour to make a soft dough.  Turn out onto a lightly floured
board; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in a
greased bowl; brush with softened shortening. Cover; let rise in a
warm place; free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Punch down; divide into quarters. Roll each qurter out on a lightly
floured board to make a circle 1/8" thick; cut the circle into 8
wedges. Roll up each wedge, starting at the wide end.  Place the
rolls, the the point underneath, on a lightly greased cookie sheet;
if desired, turn the ends in to make crescent shapes. Cover; let rise
in a warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 1
hour.  Bake in a hot oven (400F) for about 20 minutes, or until
golden.
