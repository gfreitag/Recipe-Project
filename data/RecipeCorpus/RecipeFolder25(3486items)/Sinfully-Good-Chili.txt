tomato sauce, catsup, water and vinegar.  When mixture boils, add the
rest of the salt,the remaining spices and herbs, the honey and
chocolate. Adjust seasonings, adding more salt if it needs perking
up, more cumin for a more strident chili flavor, more cinnamon and
mace if you want it more aromatic, more cardamom for more band and
more chocolate for more body. 3. Cover and simmer on very low heat
for about 1 hour, stirring and tasting occasionaly, adding tomato
juice if it is getting too dry. It should be a thick sauce. Discard
bay leaf. 4. For 5 way chili(use small oval plate if available),
layer spaghetti on the plate, top it with chili, then with a sparse
layer of kidney beans & then choped, raw onions. Pat on the cheese
while the chili is still hot and serve immediately, with oyster
crackers on the side. You may, if desired, omit either the beans or
onions, or both, for 3-way chili or 4-way chili. Serves 4 MMNorma
