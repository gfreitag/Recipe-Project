A luxury sandwich but absolutely delicious. This combination also
makes a most delicious open sandwich and allows for an artistic
arrangement. Very often these lovely sandwiches are served with fresh
crisp salad greens, making the plate most inviting.

In a small bowl, cream together the butter, lemon juice, capers, and
spread the lemon caper butter on one side of each slice of bread.
Layer half the bread slices with the salmon, avocado, sprouts and
onion. If preferred, top the sandwiches with the remaining bread
slices, pressing firmly.
