In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil,
stirring, over medium heat.  Continue to boil, brushing down the
sides   of the pan with a brush dipped in cold water, until it
reaches the soft-  ball stage, or a candy thermometer registers 240
deg.F. In a bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the yolks until they
are combined, then add the sugar syrup in a stream.  Beat until cool.
Beat in the vanilla. In a bowl, whisk the mascarpone and rum until
smooth.  In another bowl, beat the heavy cream until it holds soft
peaks.  Combine the egg mixture with the mascarpone. Fold in the
heavy cream. Line a 6-cup serving dish with the biscotti and drizzle
the espresso over them. Spoon in the mascarpone mixture, smoothing
the top, and chill, covered with plastic wrap, for at least 3 hours
or overnight.  Before serving, sprinkle the top with the grated
chocolate. Source: The Best of Italy A Cookbook/Evie Righter Posted
