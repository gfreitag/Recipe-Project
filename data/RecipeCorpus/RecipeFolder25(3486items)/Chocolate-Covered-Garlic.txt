Chocolate-covered garlic bonbons are for those with adventurous
palates and a passion for garlic in any form.  Light red wines such
as merlot or chianti work well in this recipe, but whatever decent
red wine you have on hand could be used instead.  We have specified
the brand of chocolate, as some do not melt well and make rather
lumpy-looking bonbons... 24 medium-sized garlic cloves 1/2 c. (120
ml.) red wine 1/4 (60 ml.) sugar 2-inch (5 cm.) piece of lemon rind,
yellow part only 2 oz. (60 g.) bittersweet or semisweet Lindt or
Baker's chocolate Peel the garlic cloves and remove the root end.
Discard any cloves that have brown spots or cut them away. Bring the
garlic, wine, sugar and lemon rind to a simmer in a small, heavy
noncorrodible saucepan.  Reduce the heat, cover and cook over low
heat for 25 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Test the garlic
for tenderness with the point of a sharp knife. Cool the garlic
cloves on a plate covered with a piece of waxed paper. They will be
very sticky. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over medium heat.
Cover another plate with a piece of waxed paper. Stick a toothpick in
a clove of garlic. Hold it over the edge of the pan, and with a small
spoon, cover the clove lightly with the melted chocolate. Place the
coated clove on the waxed paper to cool and harden. Coat the
remaining cloves. [note from THE GARLIC BOOK]

Store the chocolate-coated cloves in a covered container in a cool
place. Do not refrigerate ot the chocolate will change color. These
are best eaten within 24 to 48 hours.
