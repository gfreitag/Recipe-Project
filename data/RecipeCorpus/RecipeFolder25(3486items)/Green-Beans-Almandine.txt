Spray a small skillet with nonstick spray.  Then heat the skillet

allow the almonds to toast for 3 to 4 minutes until they are lightly
browned. Place the beans in a large saucepan and just enough water to
cover beans. Bring to water to boil and let beans simmer 15 minutes
or till crisp-tender. (Or, steam the beans by placing 2" of water in
the bottom of a saucepan. Place a steamer filled with the beans on
top of the water. Cover, and let the beans steam for 7 or 8 minutes.)
(Or cook frozen beans according to package directions, omitting any
margarine or salt.) Drain well. Meanwhile in a small mixing bowl stir
together the lemon juice and softened margarine. Pour this
margarine-lemon juice mixture over the green beans and toss the beans
to coat them well.  Gently stir in the toasted almonds. Serve
immediately. Food Exchanger per serving: 1 VEGETABLE EXCHANGE + 1/2
