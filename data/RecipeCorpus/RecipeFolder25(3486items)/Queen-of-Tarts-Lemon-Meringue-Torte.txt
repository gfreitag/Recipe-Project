Meringue layers: Draw three 9" circles onto parchment or waxed paper.
Place paper on a cookie sheet or jellyroll pan.  Spray with a
non-stick spray or grease well to prevent sticking.  Set aside.

In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat egg whites until stiff.
Slowly add 1/2 cup sugar.  Continue beating approximately 2 to 3
minutes on high speed until whites become very stiff.

In food processor, grind almonds with flour and 1/4 cup sugar.  This
mixture should resemble cornmeal.  Fold into beaten egg whites. Using
a pastry bag with a large tip, pipe egg whites into circles drawn on
paper. Bake at 350 F. for 35 to 45 minutes.

Note: Shells work better if not too crisp.

Filling: Heat lemon juice, sugar and lemon zest in a large bowl
placed over boiling water.  Stir until sugar dissolves.  When juice
is very hot, pour small amount into bowl of beaten eggs; blend well.
Add egg mixture back to remaining juice and stir until thick.

Remove from heat.  Cut butter into small pieces.  Add to lemon
mixture a piece at a time, stirring after each addition until melted.
Refrigerate until completely cooled.

Whip cream.  Set 1 cup of whipped mixture aside for garnish.  Fold
remaining into cooled lemon mixture.

To assemble: Trim meringue layers into neat circles and fill each
layer with lemon cream filling.  Top with fresh berries and a
decorative border of whipped cream, using the remaining cup of cream.
