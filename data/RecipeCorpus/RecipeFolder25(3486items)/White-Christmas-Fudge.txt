Title: White Christmas Fudge
Categories: Holiday, Candy, Nuts/grains, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Chopped walnuts
1 c  Diced red and green candied
-cherries
1 c  Diced candied pineapple
3 c  Sugar
1 c  Corn syrup
1 1/2 c  Light cream
1 1/2 t  Vanilla
3/4 c  Pecan halves
Grease a 8x8" pan with butter for the finished fudge. Lightly oil a
large, heavey-bottomed saucepan. In it, combine the sugar, corn syrup
and cream. Cook over low heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.
Increase the heat to moderate and heat to boiling, stirring
occasionally. Cook, without stirring, until the mixture reaches the
soft ball stage, 240F. Remove from the heat. Beat immediately until
it begins to lose its gloss and starts to get stiff. Add the vanilla.
Slowly stir in the nuts and fruit. Pack into the prepared pan and
chill. Cut into small squares when cool. This delicious fudge will
keep soft for weeks if stored in an air-tight container in a cool
place. From the book "Canadian Christmas Cooking" by Rose Murray AR/92
