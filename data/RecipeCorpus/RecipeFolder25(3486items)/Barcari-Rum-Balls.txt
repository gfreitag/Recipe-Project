Rum Balls:
From: June Popielarz (Internet) Here is a rum ball recipe from the
Bacardi Rum Party Book.  I've been enjoying it for years.

1 1/2 cups vanilla wafer crumbs (about 50 cookies) 1/4 cup Bacardi
dark rum 80 proof 1/4 cup honey 8 oz. (2 cups) ground walnuts
confectioner's (powder) sugar

Combine all ingredients, except sugar, blend thoroughly. Shape into
small balls about 1 inch in diameter.  Roll in sugar.  Store in
tightly covered container.  Makes about 2 1/2 dozen.

I keep them in the refrigerator if I'm storing them (they'll stay for
months).  I think they taste better after a few days when the
ingredients get to meld.  Food processor or rolling pin can be used
to crush cookies. Submitted By GAYE LEVY   On   12-17-94
