-and a hint on how
To get pro results.  Can't
-vouch for them as I've
-never made the dish.
These are reposts from
-other folks.
4 ea Chicken legs, skinned & cut
-into six pieces each
2 ea Egg whites
2 t  Cornstarch
1 ea TB rice vinegar
Vigorously blend egg whites and cornstarch; add chicken pieces and
toss to coat.  Heat oil in large wok and add chicken pieces in
batches, cooking each until golden, about 3 minutes, then draining.
Pour off all but 1 TB of hot oil from wok.  Add peppers and stir-fry
for 15 seconds; add green scallion, minced ginger and garlic and
stir-fry for 15 more seconds. Add mixture of vinegar, soy, wine, and
sugar, stirring until heated through. Add cornstarch and water
mixture and stir until mixture is thickened. Off heat, stir in sesame
oil, garnish with scallion greens, and serve. NOTE FROM ALAN CLAVER:
Just made my bi-monthly batch of General Tso's Chicken. I've been
trying for many months to get it to come out just like in my favorite
Chinese resturant but couldn't. Well, I recently read about the
double frying method of cooking and thought I'd try it - Yippee!
that's what we missing. What you do is deep fry the chicken pieces
once, then put them aside for a bit and reheat the oil. Then, fry
them a second time. This really gives them extra crispyness and
flavor. You couldn't tell this batch from a professional version
(umm.. modesty aside 8-)). Posted by Stephen Ceideburg December 18
