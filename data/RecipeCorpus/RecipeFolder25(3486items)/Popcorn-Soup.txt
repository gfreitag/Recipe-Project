Title: Popcorn Soup
Categories: Vegetable, Soup/stew, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Raw (unpopped) popcorn
6 c  Low-fat milk
2 c  Frozen corn kernels
1    Red bell pepper, seed/chop
1 t  Thyme, dried
Salt & pepper to taste
2 t  Vegetable oil
3    Celery stalks, chopped
1 sm Onion, chopped
1 t  Garlic, finely chopped
1 t  Cumin, ground
4 c  Chicken stock
2 c  Water
In a large, heavy soup pot, heat oil over medium-high heat.  Add
celery, onions, and garlic; saute until they begin to color, about 3
minutes. Add cumin and saute 30 seconds more.  Add chicken stock,
water, and popcorn kernels.  Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to
medium-low, cook uncovered for 30 minutes.  Turn off the heat and let
stand for 1 hour.

Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor and process for
about 30 seconds or until fairly smooth.  Return to pan, add the milk
and simmer over medium-low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally
to prevent sticking to the pan bottom.

Strain the mixture into a large bowl, rubbing some of the popcorn
kernels through the strainer.  Discard the rest of the solids and
return the soup to the pot.  Add the frozen corn, bell pepper, and
thyme. Simmer until the pepper is tender, about 2 minutes.  Season to
taste. Submitted By ROBERT WHITE   On   10-27-94
