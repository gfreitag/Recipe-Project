Title: Chocolate Fudge Truffles (Uncooked - Never Grainy)
Categories: Candy, Holiday, Dessert, Chocolate
Yield: 1 batch
3 1/2 c  Sifted confectioners' sugar
-- (1 lb.)
1 tb Pure vanilla, cognac, or
-cognac vanilla
4 oz Semisweet chocolate
-- chopped in small pieces
6 tb Unsalted butter
4 tb Heavy cream
Combine chocolate and cream in a heavy bowl over simmering water. Beat
until chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth.

Remove from heat and add to the confectioners' sugar in a mixer or
processor.  Add vanilla; mix thoroughly.

Spoon into a buttered 8" square pan.  Refrigerate until it is set, at
least several hours or overnight.  Cut into squares.  Store in a
tight tin box and keep refrigerated.

Yield: About 1 1/4 pounds.

To make truffles: When the ganache has cooled enough to handle, form
the mixture with 2 teaspoons or your fingers into small balls.  Roll
in cocoa or finely ground pecans.  Store in refrigerator.

To the wise: By adding extra heavy cream, this recipe also makes a
quick cake frosting.

Glenn writes: "This ganache can be formed into truffles and rolled in
cocoa, or cooled in a buttered 8" pan, then cut into squares.  Easy
does it!  But the best part - it is very good.  Actually, it is as
good as the quality chocolate, cream and butter you use."
