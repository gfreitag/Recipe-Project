Title: White Fruitcake
Categories: Dessert, Fruit, Cake/cookie, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Baking powder
1 c  Shortening
2 c  Sugar
1 tb Vanilla
1/2 c  Fruit sirup
8    Egg whites
1 c  Shredded coconut
1 c  Sliced citron
1 c  Raisins
1 c  Chopped candied pineapple
1 c  Candied cherries, sliced
2 c  Blanched almonds, chopped
3 c  Sifted flour
Combine first 6 ingredients with 1 cup of the flour.  Sift remaining
flour with baking powder.  Cream shortening with sugar and flavoring
until fluffy.  Add sifted dry ingredients and fruit sirup alternately
in small amounts, beating well after each addition.  Add fruit
mixture. Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry and fold into
batter. Pour into greased pans lined with heavy greased paper and
bake in a 275 degree oven for 4 hours. This recipe makes 5 pounds of
fruitcake. Personally I hate fruitcakes and think they are the
ultimate in insults to give at Christmas but dad always liked them,
so go figure. Randy Rigg Submitted By RANDY RIGG   On   12-17-94
