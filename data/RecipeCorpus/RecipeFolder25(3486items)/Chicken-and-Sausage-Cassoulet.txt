ADVANCE PREPARATION: (I didn't do this, I had beans already cooked in
the fridge, and couldn't see any reason to let the rest of the stuff
sit over night. I just browned it all and threw in the Crock Pot. My
hubby says it rates an 8 or 9, nothing other than Prime rib or
tenderloin rate any higher than that.)

In large saucepan bring beans and 4 cups water to boiling.  Reduce
heat and simmer, covered, for 1-1/2 hours.  Pour beans and liquid
into bowl. Refrigerate overnight.

Shape sausage into 18 balls; brown in skillet.  Remove meatballs;
reserve drippings in skillet.  Cover meatballs; refrigerate
overnight. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper; breown in reserved
drippings. Remove chicken; cover and refrigerate overnight.

BEFORE SERVING: In crocery cooker place chicken , meatballs, arrot,
celery, and onion. Drain beans; mix wiht remaining ingredients. Pour
over meat mixture. cover; cook on low heat setting for 8 hours.
