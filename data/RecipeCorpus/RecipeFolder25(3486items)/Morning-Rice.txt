Brian's comments: Breakfast for me is the worst part of the day's
meals. I usually have a bowl of frosted bran (0% fat) and a banana.
1% milk is put on the cereal and then each spoonful is drained of
milk before eaten. The remaining milk in the bowl after the cereal is
gone I then throw in the sink and flush down the drain. Guess that is
called 1% minus milk.
