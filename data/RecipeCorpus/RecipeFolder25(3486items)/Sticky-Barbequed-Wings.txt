Title: Sticky Barbequed Wings
Categories: Chicken, Appetizer, Bbq/grill
Yield: 36 servings
1/2 c  Soy sauce
5    Large cloves of garlic
1 kg Chicken wings
1/2 c  Liquid honey
Preheat oven to 325

Tip wings and half. Place wings in roasting pan, cover, and cook in
oven for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir honey with soy
sauce and garlic. Once wings have cooked 30 minutes, drain fat. Then,
toss with honey mixture. Return to oven and continue to cook,
uncovered, for 1 1/4 hours, turning every 20 minutes. Wings are ready
when they are richly glazed and honey mixture is no longer liquid.
They will be dark in color and gooey. Serve immediately or at room
temp.
