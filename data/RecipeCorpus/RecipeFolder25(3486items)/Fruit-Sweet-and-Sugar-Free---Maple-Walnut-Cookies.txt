Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Maple Walnut Cookies
Categories: Dessert, Diabetic, Cake/cookie
Yield: 3 dozen
1/2 t  Vanilla extract
3/4 t  Almond extract
1 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
3 c  Walnuts
1 1/2 c  Butter
3/4 c  Pure maple syrup
1    Egg
Preheat ove to 350 degrees. Toast the walnuts in the preheated oven
for 7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let the nuts cook, and then
process in a food processor, using the pulsing action until they are
finely ground. Do not overprocess or you will end up with a paste.
Cream together the butter and maple syrup. When light and fluffy, add
the egg and beat well for 1 minute. Stir in the extracts, then the
flour, and the finely ground nuts. Cover the dough and refrigerate it
for 20 minutes to make it easier to handle. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees. Line baking sheets with baking paper. Using a #24 scoop (2
tablespoons) or a spoon, scoop out the dough and place the balls 1
inch apart on the baking sheets. With lightly moistened fingers,
flatten each cookie to a thickness of 1/2 inch. Bake the cookies
until golden brown for 15-18 minutes on an insulated or double pan.
Let the cookies cool on the pans before removing.
