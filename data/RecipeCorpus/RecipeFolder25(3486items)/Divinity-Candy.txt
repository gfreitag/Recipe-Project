Title: Divinity Candy
Categories: Candy, Holiday
Yield: 1 servings
2 lg Egg Whites At Room Temp.
1 ts Vanilla Extract
3 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Light Corn Syrup
1/2 c  Water
Avoid making Divinity on a humid day; candy will not harden.  In a 2
quart saucepan over medium high heat, heat sugar, syrup and water to
boiling, stirring until sugar is dissolved.  Set candy thermometer in
place and continue cooking, without stirring until the temperature
reaches 248øF. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl with mixer at high speed,
beat egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Beating at medium speed,
slowly pour half of the syrup into whites.  Continue beating while
heating other half of syrup to 272øF. While turning bowl and
continuing beating, slowly pour remaining hot syrup into mixture
(mixture will be stiff). (Don't scrape saucepan; mixture on side may
be sugary.) Add vanilla; beat until mixture holds stiff, glossy
peaks.  Working quickly, drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto waxed
paper. Completely cool before storing.  From: Good Housekeeping
