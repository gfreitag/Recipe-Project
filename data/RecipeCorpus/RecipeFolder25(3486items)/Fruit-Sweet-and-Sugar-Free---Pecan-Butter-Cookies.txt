3    Egg whites
1 t  Vanilla extract
2 1/2 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
4 c  Pecans
1 1/2 c  Butter
1/2 c  Fruit sweetener
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Toast the pecans in the preheated
oven for 7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let the nuts cool. Then
process in a food processor, using the pulsing action until they are
finely ground, do not over process or you will end up with a paste.
Cream the butter and sweetener. When light and fluffy, add the egg
whites one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the
vanilla, then the flour and the finely chopped pecans. Cover the
dough and refrigerat it for 20 minutes to make it easier to handle.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line baking pans with baking paper.
Using a #24 scoop (2 tablespoons) or a spoon, scoop out the dough and
palce the balls 1 inch apart on the prepared baking pans. With
lightly moistened fingers, flatten each cookie to a thickness of 1/3
inch. Bake until golden brown, for approximately 15-18 minutes. Let
the cookies cool on the pans before removing.
