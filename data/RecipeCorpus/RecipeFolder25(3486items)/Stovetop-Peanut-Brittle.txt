1 c  Water
1 c  Light corn syrup
3 T  Margarine or butter
1 lb Shelled unroasted peanuts
1 1/2 t  Baking soda
1 t  Water
1 t  Vanilla
1 1/2 c  Sugar
Butter 2 cookie sheets, 15-1/2 X 12 inches, and keep warm. Mix baking
soda, 1 teaspoon water and the vanilla. Mix sugar, 1 cup water and
the corn syrup in 3-quart saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring
occasionally, to 240 degrees on candy thermometer or until a small
amount of mixture dropped into very cold water forms a soft ball that
flattens when removed from water. Stir in margarine and peanuts.
Cook, stirring constantly, to 300 degrees or until a small amount of
mixture dropped into very cold water separates into hard, brittle
threads. (Watch carefully so that mixture does not burn.) Immediately
remove from heat. Quickly stir in baking soda mixture until light and
foamy. Pour half of the candy mixture onto each cookie sheet and
quickly spread about 1/4-inch thick; cool. Break into pieces.
