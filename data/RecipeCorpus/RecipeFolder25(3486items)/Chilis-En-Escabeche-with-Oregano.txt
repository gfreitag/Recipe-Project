-- oregano leaves
3/4 c  White wine vinegar

Bring the vinegar, water, salt and sugar to a boil in a noncorrodible
saucepan.  Make sure that sugar and salt are dissolved and remove the
liquid from the heat.

Stem and seed the sweet peppers and chilis.  Cut the sweet peppers
into lengthwise strips about 1/4" wide.  Cut the chilis into
lengthwise slivers. Peel the onion and cut it into lengthwise slivers.

Put the vegetables in a glass or stainless bowl; pour the pickling
liquid over them.  Mix in olive oil and oregano.  Cover the bowl and
marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours before serving.  Drain
liquid from the escabeche before serving or storing.  Serve at cool
room temperature.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

Dille writes: "A big platter of colorful, taste-tingling chilis and
peppers is a very southwestern way to brighten and lighten a meal of
meat and masa. These accompany filling dishes such as adovados (red
chili stews), beans, enchiladas, burritos, chorizo and grilled meats
very well. This is a fresh, light escabeche, with less vinegar than
usual. The escabeche may be prepared ahead and kept refrigerated for
two or three days. Its character then will be different from when it
is served fresh, but it is still good. If red hot cherry peppers are
not available, add an extra serrano and jalapeno.
