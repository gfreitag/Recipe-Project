MMMMM----------------------WILD WING SAUCE---------------------------
Juice of 1 lime
1/2 t  Dry mustard
1/4 t  Ground anise seeds
1/4 t  Salt
1 1/2 ea Dozen uncooked chicken wings
1 c  Beer
1/4 c  Unsulphured dark molasses
1/4 c  Creamy peanut butter
1/4 c  Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 T  Chili powder
Combine the sauce ingredients in a large heavy pan.  Simmer over
medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until reduced by about one-third.
The sauce can be made a day or two ahead. Prepare the smoker for
barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200 F to 220F. Grease a large
smokeproof baking pan or dish. With a cleaver or butcher knife,
remove the chicken wing tips.  Then cut each wing in half at the
joint. Transfer the wing sections and the sauce to the baking dish.
Place the dish in the smoker and cook the chicken for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2
hours, stirring the wings once or twice. The chicken should be cooked
through and tender, and the sauce reduced to a thick glaze. Serve
hot. From: Smoke & Spice ISBN 1-555832-061 X (paper) Shared By: Pat
