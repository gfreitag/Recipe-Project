Title: Homemade Phyllo
Categories: Greek, Pastry, Homemade
Yield: 1 batch
1/2 c  Lukewarm water
2 tb Salad oil
2 2/3 c  Shifted All Purpose Flour
1 ts Salt
Sift flour and salt into a bowl.  Gradually add water, stirring to
make a stiff dough.  Turn onto a pastry board.  Place the oil in a
bowl and spread a little of it on the palms of your hands.  Knead the
dough with a folding and turning motion, adding more oil to your
hands when dough begins to stick.  Continue until you have a smooth,
elastic ball of dough and the oil is nearly all used.  Then roll the
ball of dough in the remaining oil to cover all sides, place a clean
cloth over the bowl, and allow the dough to rest for two hours or
more in a warm place away from drafts. A barely warm oven is
satisfactory.

Separate 1/4 of the dough and roll to 1/4 inch thickness on a pastry
board rubbed with cornstarch.  Cover with a clean cloth and let it
rest for 10 minutes.  Cover a table (cardtable or larger) with a
smooth cloth and carefully lift dough onto it.  Put your hands under
the dough, palms down and gently stretch and pull the dough with the
backs of your hands, working your way around the table, until the
dough is as thin as tissue paper. Do not worry if it hangs down
around the edged of the table, or if some holes appear, especially
around the edges. Cut off the thicker edge and save the scraps.

The phyllo is now ready to be cut into pieces with scissors if you
wish to use it moist.  If you prefer dry phyllo, allow it to sand
until dry, about 10 minutes, then cut into desired sizes.

The scraps of dough can be put into a moist bowl and kneaded and
rolled again.
