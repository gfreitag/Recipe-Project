Title: Golden Leeks and Onions
Categories: Vegetable, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 pn Ground white pepper,
1 pn Cinnamon
1 pn Cloves
Yellow food colouring
-(optional)
1 ts Dried saffron strands
2 tb Boiling water
6 md Leeks (white part only)
3 md Onions
2 1/2 c  Chicken stock
1/3 ts Soft light brown sugar
First, soak the saffron strands in the boiling water until the water
is deep gold. Prepare the leeks by trimming the root ends and slicing
the white stems into thin rings; they should not need parboiling.
Peel and chop the onions. Put all the ingredients in a large pan and
cook gently, uncovered, for 6-8 minutes.

Drain off most of the stock if you want to serve the vegetables as a
side dish; to make sure your dish is really golden, add a drop of
food coloring. Submitted By DIANE LAZARUS   On   12-09-94
