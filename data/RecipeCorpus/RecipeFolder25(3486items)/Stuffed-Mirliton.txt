Boil mirlitons until tender; cut and scoop out insides, leaving shell
to stuff.  Add cooking oil in skillet; add onions and cook until
tender. Add mirliton pulp; cook until tender.  Add onions, parsley,
bell pepper, salt and pepper to taste and the cooked rice.  Fill

minutes.

NOTE: These directions are typed just as they appear in the cookbook.
You'll note they make NO MENTION of what to do with the 1-lb. of
ground beef or 1/2 lb. of ham listed in the ingredients.  I would
imagine you brown the beef (or chop the ham) and add it with the
stuffing mixture. (Nancy)
