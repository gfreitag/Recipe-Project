strawberries sliced or whole. You can also use frozen fruit, thawed
and drained, or canned fruit in its own juice, not heavy syrup,
drained but the pizza won't hold as well and colors of fruit may
bleed. CRUST: Combine the flour and sweetener and cut in the
margarine. Can use a food processor. Place dough in center of pizza
pan or cookie sheet sprayed with pam. Dust fingers lightly with flour
and pat dough out into desired shape. Bake in an oven preheated to
350 degrees for 15 minutes. Cool. FILLING: Combine the softened cream
cheese with the vanilla and spread over cool crust. Arrange fruit in
a decorative pattern over the filling. Make the glaze by combining
the orange juice concentrate and lemon juice in a measuring cup. Add
enough of the water to make 1 cup. Place juice and water in a
saucepan with cornstarch and sweetener and combine thoroughly. Bring
mixture to a boil, reduce heat and cook until thickened. Cool
slightly and spread gently over fruit, don't let glaze cool too long
before spreading or it will jell. Chill until serving time; cut into
wedges to serve.
