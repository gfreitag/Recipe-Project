Salt and pepper to taste

Place chicken in a large flat dish.  Pour buttermilk over; cover and

time, in flour mixture.  Shake off excess; place on waxed paper for
15 minutes to dry.  Heat 1/8-1/4" of oil in a large skillet; fry
chicken until browned on all sides.  Cover and simmer, turning
occasionally, for 40-45 minutes, or until juices run clear and
chicken is tender. Uncover and cook 5 minutes longer. Remove chicken
and keep warm. Drain all but 1/4 cup drippings in skillet; stir in
flour until bubbly.  Add milk and 1 1/2 cups water; cook and stir
until thickened and bubbly. Cook 1 minute more. Add remaining water
if needed. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with chicken. Serves:
