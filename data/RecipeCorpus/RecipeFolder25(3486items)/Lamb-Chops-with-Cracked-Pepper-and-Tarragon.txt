Michael Roberts was one of the pioneers of California cuisine and his
West Hollywood restaurant, Trumps, is the perfect sunny location for
his creative fare.  When he visited "LIVE", Regis and he got all
choke up, literally - over this fresh tasting recipe for lamb chops.
The heat on the stove was turned up a little too high, so when
Michael seared the chops, smoke rose - and they were both ready to
call the fire department! In addition to being a successful
restauratuer, Michael has published three cookbooks, Secret
Ingredients, Fresh from the Freezer, and What's for Dinner? 1 tbsp
coarsely crushed black pepper 4 loin lamb chops 1 tbsp olive oil 1/4
tsp salt 1/4 cup veal stock or canned low sodium beef broth 2 tbsp
freshly squeezed lime juice 1 tbsp unsalted butter grated peel from
1/2 lime 1/2 tbsp chopped fresh tarragon, or 1/2 tsp dried tarragon
leaves

Place the pepper on a plate and press each lamb chop firmly into the
pepper so that it adheres to the meat on both sides.  In a large
skillet, heat the oil over high heat.  When it is very hot, add the
chops and sear quickly on both sides.  Sprinkle evenly with the salt
and reduce the heat to medium. Add the stock or broth and the lime
juice and continue cooking for about 2 minutes, or until done to your
taste. Remove the chops and keep them warm. If you are using dried
tarragon leaves, add it to the liquid now. Continue cooking the
liquid until it becomes a shiny glaze. Remove the pan from the heat
and whisk in the butter. Add the grated lime peel and the fresh
tarragon, if using it. Spoon the sauce over the chops and serve.
