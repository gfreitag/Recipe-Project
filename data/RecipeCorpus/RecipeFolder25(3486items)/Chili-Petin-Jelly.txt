Categories: Chili, Condiment, Can/preserv, Microwave

1 1/2 c  Vinegar
6 oz Pectin

Pulverize peppers in a blender.  In a large glass casserole, stir in
the sugar and vinegar.  Cover and bring to a boil in the microwave.
It takes 10 to 12 minutes on the high setting.  Stir after the first
5 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes.  Stir in pectin and 3 drops of
food coloring. Bottle (in sterilized jars if you aren't going to
gobble it all in a few days). Store in the refrigerator.

Webber wrote: "If you strain the mixture at the time you first stir
it, it will turn out as clear jelly.  It looks like _mint_ jelly!  It
would be a kindness to your guests to warn them if you serve this
with a leg of lamb."
