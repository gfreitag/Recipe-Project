blended. Beat in eggs and egg yolks one at a time; beat until smooth,
scraping bowl with spatula occasionally. Beat in cream.

Pour filling into prepared pan. Bake 10 minutes.  Lower oven

not firm. Remove to rack; cool 2 hours. With back of spoon, spread
sour cream evenly over top of cake to within 1/2 inch of edge.

sauce meets the peach puree. Add whole raspberries as desired. Cut

cracker crust regipe, use halt graham cracker crumbs and half

version of an old favorite.
