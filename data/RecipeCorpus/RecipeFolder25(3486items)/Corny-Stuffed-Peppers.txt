NOTE: You may use green peppers, but I like the way red and yellow
ones look and they're slightly sweeter. Choose peppers that will
stand without tipping over. -- Lee Bailey

Preheat the oven to 350oF.

Slice off the stems of the peppers, and remove the seeds and
membranes. Put the peppers in a pot of boiling water and boil for
about 5 minutes, to soften. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, in a
medium skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Saute the minced
onion and celery until wilted, about 5 minutes. Scrape into a bowl
and add the corn and tomatoes. Toss, then toss again with the salt
and black pepper. Toss in the bread crumbs and then the eggs. Stuff
the peppers, mounding the tops.

Place in a baking pan containing about 1/2" of hot water. Top with the
shredded cheese and cover with aluminum foil (oil the underside).
Bake for about 1 hour, uncovering for the last 10 minutes.
