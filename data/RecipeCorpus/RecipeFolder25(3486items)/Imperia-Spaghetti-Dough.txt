Title: Imperia Spaghetti Dough
Categories: Pasta, Information
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Water per egg.
6 c  Flour
6    Eggs OR substitute
Sift flour into medium bowl(I use processor) and make a well.  Place
eggs or water in well and begin pulling flour into liquid.  Dough
should be moderately stiff.  Knead till smooth and firm.  Roll out
1/2" thick. Pass the dough through the rollers at least 4 times at
greatest opening size. Begin making it smaller passing dough 2 times
at each setting. When desired thickness is reached.  Put through
desired cutter. Cook in boiling salted water 8-10 minutes.   That's
what my booklet says. hp Submitted By HELEN PEAGRAM   On   11-21-94
