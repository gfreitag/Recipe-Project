With golden autumn colors and harvest fresh flavors, this dish is a
tasty celebration of fall.  Choose and easy to peel squash such as
butternut or Delicata, or pick an acron squash and leave the skin on
for color contrast. Serve with rice, tender crips green beans and
sourdough bread. 4 pork chops about 1-1/2 lbs 1 onion, diced 1-1/2
cups apple cider or juice 2-1/2 cups thinly sliced peeled squash,
about 1/2 a squash 1/4 cup sliced dried apricots

Trim off any fat from pork; sprinkle with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp
pepper. In large heavy skillet, heat 1 tsp vegetable oil over medium
high heat. Cook pork chops for 3-4 minutes on each side or until
browned all over. Remove and set aside.  Add onion to pan, cook over
medium heat, stirring occasionally and adding 1 tbsp water if
necessary to prevent sticking, for about 5 minutes or until softened.
Pour in apple cider, stirring to scrape up brown bits from bottom of
pan.  Add sliced squash and apricots. Cover and simmer for 7-8
minutes or until squash is tender. Return pork chops to pan, cook for
3-5 minutes or just until no longer pink inside. Makes 4 servings.
