Categories: Bread, French, Canadian
Yield: 2 servings
1 T  Salt
1/4 c  Melted shortening
6 c  Flour
Cornmeal
Pickling salt (optional)
PROOF
High rising free-form
-loaves, just like our
-colonial ancestors made.
Makes 2 free-form loaves.
2 c  Warm water
2 T  Sugar
2 T  Yeast
In a bread bowl, pour 2 cups warm water. Add 2 tablespoons sugar, but
do not stir. Slowly sprinkle 2 tablespoons yeast into the water,
making sure each particle gets wet. Again, do not stir. Wait 10
minutes until the yeast is thick and foamy. MIX After 10 minutes add
the following ingredients to your bread bowl, stirring well between
each addition: 1 tablespoon salt, 2 cups flour, 1/4 cup cooled,
melted shortening. ADD FLOUR (slowly) Add remaining flour 2 cups at a
time to make a stiff dough. Lightly coat the dough with flour before
turning it out. KNEAD Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
surface and knead until smooth and elastic: 10 minutes. 1ST RISING
Place the dough in a greased bowl, turn to grease the top, set in a
warm, draft-free spot until double: 1 1/2 hours. SHAPE When the dough
has doubled, punch it down and turn it out onto a clean surface.
Knead the dough briefly to break the large air bubbles. Cut the dough
in half and shape each half into a smooth round ball. Pour cornmeal
on a ungreased cookie sheet, only where the dough will be placed.
Place the loaves on the cornmeal. 2ND RISING Set the loaves in a
warm, draft-free spot, allow to rise until double: 30 minutes. BAKE
Before baking, slah the tops 2-3 times with a very sharp knife.
Sprinkle the tops with pickling salt. Bake in a 400 degree F oven for
30 minutes. Cool immediately after baking on a wire rack. Source:
