plastic bag and shake until well coated. Place side by side into
baking dish. Pour remaining liquid between pieces, and sprinkle dry
ingredients onto top of chicken. Bake at 350 degrees F. for one hour,
or until no red comes to the surface when you pierce chicken with a
fork. Remove chicken from disk, and allow fat to drain off. Don't

good it is!
