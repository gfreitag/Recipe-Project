Title: Beer Salami
Categories: Beef, Pork, Sausage, Homemade
Yield: 10 pounds
1 1/2 tb Crushed mustard seed
2 ts Garlic, finely minced
4    Feet large beef casings
3 lb Corned beef brisket, cubed
7 lb Ham, cubed, fat included
1 1/2 tb Coarsley ground black pepper
1 tb Ground mace
Grind the corned beef through the fine disk. Mix the beef and ham
cubes and mix in the seasonings. Grind through the coarse disk.
Prepare casings, xtuff and tie off into 6-7" lengths. Mature in the
refrigerator 24 hours. Bring to room temperature, wipe dry. Begin
smoking at about 80 degrees and gradually raise the temperature to
160. This should take about 4 hours. Smoke an additional 2 hours.
Cool by dunking in a pot of cool (not cold) water for about 5 minutes
until it is cool to the touch. Dry the salami thoroughly and store it
in the refrigerator. Note: Because we used cured meat in this recipe,
there was no need for any other curing agents or additional salt.
