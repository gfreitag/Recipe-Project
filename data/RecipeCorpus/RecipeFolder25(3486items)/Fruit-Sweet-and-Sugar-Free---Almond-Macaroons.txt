Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Almond Macaroons
Categories: Diabetic, Cake/cookie, Nuts/grains
Yield: 48 cookies
MMMMM------------------------ALMOND PASTE-----------------------------
1/2 t  Vanilla extract
2 T  Butter
1 c  Blanched almonds
2 T  Fruit sweetener
1 t  Almond extract
MMMMM-------------------------MACAROONS------------------------------
1    Egg white
2 1/2 T  White flour
1 c  Almond paste
1/4 c  Fruit sweetener
To prepare the almond paste, process the almonds in a food processor,
using a pulsing action until very finely ground. Mix in the sweetener
and extracts. Cut the butter into six pieces. While the food
processor is running, add the butter pieces and process for thirty
seconds until well combined. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line
baking sheets with baking paper. Use an electric mixer or food
processor to blend the almond paste with the 1/4 cup of sweetener
until smooth. Beat in the egg white, and then fold in the flour.
Macaroon batter should be soft, but not runny. Drop the batter by
teaspoonfuls (or pipe through a pastry bag fitted with a plain 1/2
inch round tip) onto baking sheets, leaving one inch around each
cookie. Bake for 10-15 minutes on insulated or double pans, until
lightly browned. Let the cookies cool on the pans before removing.
