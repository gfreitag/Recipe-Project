Title: Orange-Ginger Cranberry Relish
Categories: Relish, Holiday
Yield: 4 cups
2/3 c  Orange marmalade
1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
1/4 ts Nutmeg, ground
1/4 ts Cloves, ground
3 c  Fresh cranberries
1/3 c  Sugar
2 tb Brandy
2/3 c  Ginger marmalade
Blend cranberries, sugar and brandy in food processor or blender until
cranberries are just chopped. Taste for sweetness. Add sugar if
needed. Stir in remaining ingredients by hand. Make at least 3 hours
ahead so that the flavours have a chance to blend. Substitutions: I
usually use orange marmalade but lemon or lime would be interesting.
Grand Marnier works as well, or better than, regular brandy but
orange juice or even water would work for a non-alcoholic relish.
This keeps for a week in the refrigerator. Sharon Verrall December,
