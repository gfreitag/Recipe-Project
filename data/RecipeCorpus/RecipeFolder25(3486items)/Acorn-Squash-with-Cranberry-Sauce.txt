CRANBERRY SAUCE: In a small saucepan, combine cranberries, orange and
apple pieces.  Add water.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat.  Add
cinnamon and ginger; simmer until mixture is soft and stir in sugar.

SQUASH METHOD #1:  Cut each squash in half and remove seeds.  Place
squash, cut side down, in a steamer basket and steam for 15 minutes.
Squash is done when a fork pierces the skin easily.

SQUASH METHOD #2: Slice squash in half.  Scoop out the seeds and
slice a tiny bit off the bottom of the squash so it will sit on th
plate later. Place squash halves cut side down in a glass dish in
1/8" water. Prick the skin with a fork several times.  Cover the dish
with plastic wrap and microwave for about 3 to 5 times, depending on
size of the squash. Squash is done when a fork pierces the skin
easily. After either method of preparation, stuff the cranberry
mixture into the squash for 5 minutes or microwave for 1 minute. Food
