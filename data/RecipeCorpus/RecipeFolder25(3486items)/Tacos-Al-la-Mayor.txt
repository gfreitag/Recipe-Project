Sam Pick, the mayor of the oldest capital city in the United States,
Santa Fe, took time off to prepare his specialty for "Live" viewers.
This deluxe version of tacos for those who like things hot is a quick
recipe for last minute quests.  You can use either ground beef or
ground chicken. Look for the seasonings in stores that carry Mexican
specialty items. 1 lb ground beef or chicken 1 tbsp ground pure red
chile, mild 1 tbsp ground pure red chile, hot 1/2 tsp ground Mexican
oregano 1/2 tsp ground cumin 1 garlic clove, finely chopped salt to
taste 8 taco shells, warmed 1 small onion, chopped 2-1/2 cups
shredded lettuce 1 tomato, chopped 1-1/2 cups grated cheese, such as
cheddar or Monterey jack salsa

In a large skillet, cook the meat over medium heat for about 5
minutes, or until lightly browned, stirring to break up the meat.
Stir in the chiles, oregano, cumin, garlic, and salt.  Cook, stirring
for a minute or two longer to allow the flavors to develop.  Drain
off any fat. Spoon the meat mixture into the taco shells.  Top each
taco with the onion, lettuce, tomato, and cheese.  Spoon salsa over
the top.  Makes 4 servings. Origin: Cooking with Regis and Kathie
