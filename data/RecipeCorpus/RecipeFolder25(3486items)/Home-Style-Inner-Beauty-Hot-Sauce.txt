"Mix all the ingredients together and stand back.  This will keep,
covered and refrigerated, until the year 2018.  Be careful, though:
if it spills, it will eat a hole in your refrigerator.  If you ever
want to dispose of it, call the local toxic waste specialists."

"Warning: Hottest sauce in North America.  Use this to enhance dull
and boring food.  Keep away from pets, open glames, unsupervised
children, and bad advice.  This is not a toy.  This is serious. Stand
up straight, sit right, and stop mumbling."

"Be careful not to rub your nose, eyes, or mouth while working with
habaneros (scotch bonnets).  You may actually want to wear rubber
gloves while chopping and mixing -- these babies are powerful."
