3 c  Vanilla wafers--crushed
1 c  Finely chopped nuts
3 oz Rum (more or less to taste)

To make crumbs, put wafers in plastic bag and roll with rolling
pin. Pour into bowl and mix above ingredients, adding rum last. Shape
into balls about 1" in diameter. Roll in 4x sugar and chill. This
mixture is sticky, so keep fingers and palms of hands dusted with 4x
