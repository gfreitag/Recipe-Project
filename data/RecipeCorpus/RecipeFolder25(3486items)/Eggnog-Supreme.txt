Title: Eggnog Supreme
Categories: Beverage, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 2 quarts
3 c  Heavy cream
Rum/brandy if desired
12    Eggs
1 c  Sugar
2 c  Light cream
In a large bowl combine 12 egg yolks and 1 cup sugar; beat till lemon
colored and thick.  Slowly add 2 cups light cream.  Add 1 liter
rum/brandy at this point if desired.  Beat to blend well and chill 1
hour or more to allow eggs to mellow.

Beat egg whites until moderately stiff (soft peaks). Whip the heavy
cream & fold in the egg whites, then fold into the yolk mixture in a
large punch bowl. Garnish with grated nutmeg.

This eggnog is very thick and rich; you almost need a spoon to 'eat'
it! Submitted By ROBERT WHITE   On   12-21-94
