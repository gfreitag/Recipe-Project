For cholesterol watchers, use only the egg white to bind and moisten
the meat. Turkey may not brown as well as beef or pork, so cook these
meatballs over medium-high heat before adding them to the tomato
sauce. Our rich, flavorful sauce is enhanced with both red and green
bell peppers. The sauce finishes cooking the meat.

1. For the sauce, heat olive in a large, heavy pot over medium-low
heat. Add onion, bell peppers and garlic; cook for 15 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Add tomatoes along with 1 cup of reserved
juices, tomato paste, oregano, sugar, salt and black pepper.

2. Cook for 25 minutes. Mash the garlic in the pot and adjust
seasonings. Stir in the parsley and set the sauce aside.

3. Prepare the meatballs: Mix all the ingredients, except oil,
together in a bowl. Form the mixture into 24 meatballs, each about 1
1/2" in diameter.

4. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 10" skillet over medium-high heat and
cook the meatballs in batches, shaking the pan occasionally, for
about 10-12 minutes or until browned and cooked through. Add more oil
if necessary. Remove the meatballs to paper towels to drain.

5. Place the tomato sauce over medium heat to warm through. Add the
meatballs and cook for 10-12 minutes.

6. To serve, spoon about 1/4 cup of the sauce into each piece of
bread or roll, coating the interior well. Insert 3 meatballs into
each and serve immediately.
