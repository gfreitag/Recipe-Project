Title: Eggnog - Mine
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Beverage, Holiday
Yield: 4 servings
Sugar, mix until disolved.
-sprinkle with nutmeg.
Beat eggwhites until
-fluffy, fold into eggnog.
-Cover and let
"age" for 24 hours.
These proportions yield
-approx 3 1/2 quarts,
-filling my big pyrex
Mixing bowl EXACTLY to the
-rim.  ++> 14 cup or 28
-punchcup
Servings. It;s really
-imperative that you let it
-rest overnite
To "smooth out" the
-flavour.  If refrigerator
-space is at a
Premium, you can keep the
-eggwhites covered,
-unbeaten, in a
Separate container and just
-let the
-egg/cream/sugar/liquor mix
"mellow", beating and
-adding the eggwhites
-before serving.
Marge Clark's Christmas
-Eggnog
This recipe is TRULY
-fabulous.  Sometimes I
-hear from folks who
We knew 20 years ago...they
-ask if I still do the
-eggnog party,
And tell me they still use
-the recipe.
1/2 ea Dozen eggs, separated
2/3 c  Cognac
2/3 c  Bourbon
1/3 c  Peach brandy
2/3 c  Rum
7 c  Half 'n Half
1 1/8 c  Sugar  (1 c + 2 Tbsp)
Nutmeg to taste....(lots!)
Beat the egg yolks until
-very light.  Pour in the
-liquor, one
Type at a time and beat
-well.  (Add the rum LAST
-to avoid
"curdling" the eggs).  Add
-cream slowly, while
-mixing.  Add
I used 2 punchbowls, one big one held a double batch, the smaller one
held 1 1/2 batches.  I used 1/2 gallon milk cartons to store it in
the fridge until party day....  and kept the punchbowl supply chilled
with a giant block of "natural" vanilla ice cream.
