The author writes: "For something different in a brown-bag lunch,
pack a pita pocket with crunchy cashews, cucumber, sweet pepper and a
refreshing curry-yogurt sauce.  To tote this sandwich to work or
school, wrap the pita pocket in plastic wrap, then pack the cashew
salad separately in an airtight container.  Place the container of
salad in an insulated lunch box with a frozen ice pack, where it
should hold for up to 6 hours. At lunchtime, spoon the salad into the
pita pocket."
