NOTE: Leftover roast beef will do a good job too, as will canned
pintos. The church chili supper is a traditional cold-weather affair
all over the United States. This is a church-supper recipe from the
Texas Cooking Under Six Flags, published in the early 1950's by the
Holy Cross Episcopal Church of Paris, Texas
