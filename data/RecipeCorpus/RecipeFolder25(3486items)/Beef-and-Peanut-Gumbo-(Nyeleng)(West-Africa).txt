Categories: African, Nuts/grains, Beef, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
-style peanut butter
1 c  Jamaica flowers
1    Onion
2    Chilies, not seeded

2 lb Beef, cut in pieces
2 t  Salt

The word "nyeleng" comes from the Mandinka language of West Africa,
but the Mandinkas' peanut-farming neighbors, the Wolof people of
Senegal, now make this dish as well. Jamaica (pronounced hah-MY-kah)
is the Spanish name for the dried blossom of an African shrub,
Hibiscus sabdariffa. It is sold in Latin markets and many
supermarkets under the name of jamaica.

Place beef in pot. Add salt, dried shrimp and boiling water. Reduce
heat and simmer 3/4 hour, skimming as needed. Add okra and cook until
seeds turn reddish, about 1/2 hour. Add peanut butter and jamaica and
cook additional 1/2 hour.

Chop onion and chilies and add, stirring briskly to develop sticky
texture. Simmer 15 minutes and serve with millet or cornmeal mush.

Makes 2 1/2 quarts or 4-6 servings.
