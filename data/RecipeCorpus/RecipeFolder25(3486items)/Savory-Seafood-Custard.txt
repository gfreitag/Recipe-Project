1. Place 1 clam in each of 4 custard cups or bowls (3/4 cup size).
Set the cups in a large baking pan at least 2" deep.

2. In a bowl, combine reserved 1/4 cup liquid from cooked clams, clam
juice, 1/4 cup water, egg whites, 2 teaspoons fish sauce, and ginger;
beat lightly just to blend. Pour 1/4 of the mixture into each cup.

3. Set pan on center rack of a 325'F. oven. Pour boiling water into
pan around cups to level of custard. Bake until custard jiggles only
slightly when gently shaken, 25-35 minutes. Lift cups from pan. Let
stand at least 10 minutes. If made ahead, cool, cover, and chill up
to a day. Garnish with onion. Offer warm or cold, with fish sauce to
add to add to taste.

*** COOKED CLAMS ***

1. Scrub and rinse clams, suitable for steaming (about 1 1/2" wide).
in a 1 1/2 quart pan, bring water to a boil. Add clams; cover and
simmer until they open, about 5 minutes.

2. Or, to cook in a microwave oven, place clams in a microwave-safe 1
quart container. Cover with plastic wrap and cook at full power (100
percent), checking every 30 seconds, until clams open, 2-3 minutes
total.

3. Remove the clams as they open; continue cooking until all are
open. (If a clam doesn't open, discard it and cook another.) Use
clams warm or cool. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid.
