Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Chili Powder
1/2 ts Cayenne Pepper
1 cn Stewed Tomatoes
-or-
1 cn Ro*Tel Diced Tomatoes
-with Green Chilies
1    Bay Leaf
2/3 c  Raw Brown Rice (Not Instant)
1 tb Oil (or Pam Olive Oil Spray)
2    Chicken Thighs, Skinned,

1 pk (10oz) Froz Chopped Spinach
1 cn Chicken Broth, Low-Salt
3/4 c  Salsa, Medium
1/2 ts Jalapeno Sauce (Mcilhenny)
Put oil in very hot pan, add chicken, onion and garlic. Stirfry
rapidly till chicken is lightly browned & sealed on all sides.

Put in 2.5 quart crockpot with all other ingredients. Add enough
water to come within 1" of top. Cook on low all day. Whoever gets
home from work first, stir it and check the water level. If you need
to add more water, be sure and turn the pot to "High". AND KEEP THE
LID ON FIRMLY!

Makes a thick soup, almost a stew consistency. It is slightly spicy.
If you want it spicier, use hotter salsa, more chili powder, more
cayenne, and/or more jalapeno sauce.

Serve with a spoonful of fat-free sour cream and some chopped green
onion on the soup. Looks pretty. Stir it in tastes heavenly!
