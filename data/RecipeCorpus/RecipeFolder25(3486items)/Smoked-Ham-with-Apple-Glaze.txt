whole cloves.  Heat apple jelly over medium heat until melted; add
spices and pineapple juice, stirring until well blended.  Spoon half
of glaze over ham.

Return ham to oven; baste with remaining glaze during last 30 minutes
of baking time.  Lift ham onto a platter.  Garnish with grapes and
watercress, if desired.
