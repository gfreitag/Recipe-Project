Title: How To Fillet a Roundfish
Categories: Information, Fish
Yield: 1 info  Filleting a roundfish (as opposed to a flatfish such as flounder or
sole) involves no more than a sharp filleting or boning knife and the
basic knowledge that most roundfish have a straight backbone with
ribs coming off it. Practice on mackerel, which is not only cheap but
nicely shaped. In time, you'll cut down on waste, save money, and
have lots of lovely bones for fish stock.

1. If you're starting with a whole fish, make a cut from the top to
the bottom of the fish, right behind the gill cover.

2. Cut on one side of the dorsal fin(s), straight into the fish. Feel
with the blade of the knife for the central backbone, and keep the
knife right on top of it as you move down the length of the fish.

3. Peel back the meat so you can see the ribs beneath the backbone,
keeping the knife on top of them. Turn the fish over and repeat t he
technique on the other side.
