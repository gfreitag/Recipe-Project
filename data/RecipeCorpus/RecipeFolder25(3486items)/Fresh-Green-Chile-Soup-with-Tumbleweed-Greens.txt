Roast the chiles and peppers by the Open-Flame Method.  Peel the

and set aside.

In a medium saucepan, parboil the potatoes in boiling water with 1
teaspoon of the salt until tender.

Puree the green chiles and then the red peppers separately in a food
processor until smooth.  Mix the purees together, add the potatoes and
stock, and process in 2-cup batches for another minute, or until
smooth. Add the remaining salt, the pepper, and garlic and process
again. Press the puree through a fine sieve.

Heat the puree in a saucepan. l Serve hot, garnished with sour cream
and the tumbleweed greens. ***********************

Green chiles are commonly found in most Southwestern kitchens.  They
ar eused as a condiment by Native Americans in northern Arizona and
throughout the pueblos of New Mexico.  Here they are used as a base
for a spicy soup. The garnish of tumbleweed greens and sour cream is
a refreshingly cool contrast to the fiery taste of the chiles.

This dish can be served as a meal in itself with Indian Frybread, Piki
Bread, or Adobe Bread.  It also makes an excellent first course.
