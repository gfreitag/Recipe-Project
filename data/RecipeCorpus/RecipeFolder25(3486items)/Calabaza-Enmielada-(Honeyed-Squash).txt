Title: Calabaza Enmielada (Honeyed Squash)
Categories: Tex/mexican, Dessert, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
;into pea-size pieces or 2
;cups dark brown sugar
1/2 c  Water
1 c  Heavy cream; stiffly whipped
3 lb Butternut squash; or hubbard
;or 3 one pound acorn
;squashes
1 lb Mexican piloncillo; broken
If your are using the butternut or hubbard squash, with a sharp
knife cut it in half lengthwise and divide each half, as equally as
possible, into 3 pieces.  If your are using acorn squash, cut each
one in half. In either case, remove all the seeds and cut away any
stringy filaments. Pour the water into a 12 inch skillet or shallow
flameproof casserole, and in it arrange the pieces of squash side by
side. Sprinkle each piece with the piloncillo or brown sugar, and
bring the water to a boil over high heat. Then reduce the heat to its
lowest point, cover the pan and simmer for 1 hour, basting the squash
every 10 minutes with the pan liquid. when the squash is tender but
not mushy, turn off the heat and let the squash cool in the pan to
room temperature.
To serve, arrange the squash on a platter or in individual dessert
bowls, and spoon over it a little of its cooking liquid--now a syrup.
If you like, top each piece of squash with whipped cream.
