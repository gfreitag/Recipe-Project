Title: Liverwurst
Categories: Pork, Sausage, Homemade, German
Yield: 2 pounds
2 ts Paprika
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Marjoram
1/2 ts Finely ground coriander
1/4 ts Mace
1/4 ts Allspice
1/4 ts Ground cardamom
1 lb Fresh pork liver, cubed
3/4 lb Lean pork butt, cubed
1/4 lb Pork fat, cubed
1 1/2 c  Finely diced white onion
3 tb Powdered milk
1 ts Finely ground white pepper
1 1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
Put the cubes of liver, pork, and fat through the fine disk
separately, then mix and grind again. Sprinkle the remaining
ingredients over the meat and mix in with your hands. Run through
twice more, chilling a half hour in between. Pack the mixture into
muslin casings (see info recipe), packing the meat as firmly as
possible. Stitch or twist tie the opening closed securley. Boil
enough water to cover the liverwurst by 2-3". Submerge and weight the
liverwurst to keep it under the water. Return to boiling; reduce heat
to barely simmering and cook for three hours. Drain hot water and
replace with ice water. When cool, refrigerate overnight and remove
from muslin casing. Eat within 10 days.
