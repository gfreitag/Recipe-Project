Put beans in a colander and rinse them well, turning the beans over
and over as the water runs on them and checking for any large pieces
of grit or small stones.  Drain well, then put in a bowl and cover
with water. Set aside to soak overnight.

Drain beans, then put about 10 cups of water in a pan.  Add the beans,
bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.  Meanwhile, stem and seed one
of the green peppers.  Chop it and add to beans, along with bay leaf.
Cook 1 hour, uncovered.  Remove bay leaf.

Cook bacon in a skillet.  When it's cooked crisp, remove it to drain.
As the bacon cooks, seed and chop the remaining green pepper.  Peel
and chop the onion and garlic.  Cut pumpkin into 1/2" to 1" cubes.
Add pepper, onion, garlic, pumpkin, cumin, salt and pepper to the
skillet after removing bacon.  Cook vegetables about 15 minutes over
medium-high heat, or until softened.

Add vegetables to beans and cook another hour, uncovered, or until
beans are tender.

Cook rice.

When ready to serve, dish beans over hot rice on serving plates and
crumble a little bacon over each dish.  You may want to add a
sprinkle of sherry to each one too.  Pass hot red pepper sauce and
use as desired.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
