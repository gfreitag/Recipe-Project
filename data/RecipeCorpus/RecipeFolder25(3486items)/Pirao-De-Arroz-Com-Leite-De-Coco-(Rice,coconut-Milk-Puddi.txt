Categories: So. america, Pudding, Rice
Yield: 6 servings
3/4 c  Rice flour
1 ts Salt
4 c  Coconut milk; made with 2
;fresh coconuts and 4 cups
;of milk
Name; Rice and Coconut Milk Pudding

In a heavy 2 to 3 quart saucepan, scald 3 cups of the coconut milk
by warming it over moderate heat until tiny bubbles form around the
edge of the pan.  Combine the remaining 1 cup of coconut milk with
the rice flour and salt in a small bowl and, stirring constantly,
pour it gradually into the scalded milk.  Reduce the heat to low and
cook, stirring , until the mixture is thick and smooth.

Pour the pudding into a lightly or oiled 1 quart metal or porcelain
mold or into 6 individual 6 to 8 ounce custard molds and cool it to
room temperature.  Then refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until
the pudding is firm.

The pudding may be served directly from the mold (or molds) in
which it chilled or it may be unmolded in the following fashion: Run
a thin, sharp knife around the inside edge of the mold and dip the
bottom of the mold in hot water for a few seconds.  Place an inverted
plate over the top of the mold and, grasping the plate and mold
firmly together in both hands, quickly turn them upside down.  Rap
the plate sharply on the table. Then pudding should slip out of the
mold easily. If it doesn't, repeat the whole process.

Pirao de arroz com leite de coco is traditionally served as an
accompaniment to vatapa or bobo.
