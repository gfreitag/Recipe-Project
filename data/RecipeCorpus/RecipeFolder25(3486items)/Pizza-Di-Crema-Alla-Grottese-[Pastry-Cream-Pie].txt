PREPARE PASTRY CREAM: Bring milk, orange zest, and half the sugar to
a boil. Whisk the egg yolks in a bowl, then whisk in the remaining
sugar and sift the flour on top. Whisk the flour in smoothly. When
the milk mixture boils, whisk about one-third of it into the yolk
mixture. Return remaining milk mixture to heat and bring back to a
boil. Whisk the yolk mixture into it and continue whisking until the
cream thickens and returns to a boil. Remove from heat and whisk in
the vanilla and cinnamon. Pour into a bowl, cover surface directly
with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until cold. ASSEMBLE PASTRY: Cut
off one-third pasta frolla and reserve. Roll out rest of dough into a
14-inch disk and line a buttered 9-inch cake pan with it. Allow dough
to hang over edge of pan. Pour in half the pastry cream and
distribute cherries evenly over the cream, then cover cherries with
remaining cream. Roll out reserved dough into a 10-inch square and
cut into 10 inch-wide strips. Prepare egg wash by beating the egg
with salt. Paint strips with the egg wash. Moisten the edge of the
dough in the pan with egg wash and arrange the strips in a diagonal
lattice, 5 in each direction. Press the edges of the strips lightly
into the rim of the dough. trim the edges of the dough to be even and
push dough off top rim of pan so it is entirely within the pan. Bake
at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes, until pastry is light gold. Cool
in the pan on a rack before unmolding. To unmold, invert onto a flat
platter, lift off the pan, replacing it with another plate, then
invert so pie is right side up. Serve at room temperature. Store
refrigerated in plastic wrap. Submitted By NICK LA ROCCA   On
