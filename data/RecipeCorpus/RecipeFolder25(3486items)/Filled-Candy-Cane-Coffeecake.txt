Frozen bread dough, which can be purchased in packages of 3 loaves,
may be substituted for our dough.  If using frozen dough, begin the
recipe at Step 2.  This recipe makes 3 coffeecakes, which can be made
ahead and frozen. To freeze:  Bake cakes as described below, but do
not glaze. Cool completely on wire racks.  Wrap tightly in plastic
wrap, then foil. Freeze for up to 2 months.  To serve, thaw
completely, then reheat in 350F oven 15 minutes. Glaze while still
hot.

1.  To prepare dough:  Coat baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.
Dissolve yeast in water in large mixing bowl.  Add buttermilk, sugar,
butter, eggs, baking powder, salt and 2 cups of the flour.  Beat on
medium speed 2 minutes.  Stir in remaining flour by hand to make
manageable dough. Turn dough out onto well-floured surface; knead 5
minutes or until smooth and elastic.  Divide into thirds.

2.  Roll each third of dough out into 15x6-inch rectangle.  Place on
prepared baking sheet.  On long sides of rectangles, make 2-inch cuts
perpendicular to edge, at 1/2-inch intervals.

3.  To prepare filling:  Combine mixed fruit, walnuts, butter and
cinnamon in small bowl.  Spoon one-third of filling lengthwise down
center of each rectangle.  Fold over strips; pinch the open ends
along one side to seal. Shape each into a cane.  Cover the breads
with a clean kitchen towel; let rise in warm place, away from drafts,
until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.

4.  Preheat oven to 375F.

5.  Bake coffeecakes in preheated 375F oven for 18 to 20 minutes or
until golden.

6.  Meanwhile, prepare glaze:  Mix together confectioners' sugar and
water in small bowl until well blended.  If you prefer a thinner
glaze, stir in more water, 1/4 teaspoon at a time, until desired
consistency. Spread over coffeecake.
