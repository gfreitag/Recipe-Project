CBS sportscaster Terry Bradshaw claims that cooking is like playing
football. "There are times when you have to make it up as you go
along," says the former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback. "You have to
be extemporaneous and make adjustments. Sometimes you succeed,
sometimes you fumble." Bradshaw devised this recipe especially for TV
Guide. "I've been smokin' stuff for a long time," he says, "but I
don't understand spices. I just grab anything and pile it on."

1. Soak hickory chips overnight in wine and water. Place chips under
cooking rack of gas grill. Preheat to medium. Fill a 13x9" baking pan
with 1/2" of water. Add onions, sliced pepper and garlic. Place pan
directly on grill.

2. Split chicken in half, skin, cut off fat and wash thoroughly. Coat
in oil and sprinkle with pepper, lemon juice, Cajun seasoning and
paprika. Place chicken on wire cookie rack. Set rack directly over
baking pan already on grill. (Water in the pan will boil and create
the steam that cooks the chicken." Cover grill and cook for about 90
minutes, or until meat falls off the bone.
