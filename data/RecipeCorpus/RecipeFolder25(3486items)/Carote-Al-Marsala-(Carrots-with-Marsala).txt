~---Marsala is a typical Sicilian dessert wine, very fragrant and
quite sweet.  There is a dry version which is also served as an
apertif. ~---

Heat a large pan over high heat and add oil and carrots.  Saute over
high heat for about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, add
water and lower heat.  Cook over low heat until almost tender (about
8 minutes).

Raise the heat and sprinkle sugar over the carrots, stirring so they
become lightly carmelized.  Sprinkle with the Marsala and let it
evaporate. Serve immediately.
