1 pk Prunes 12 oz.

1. Cover prunes with water and bring to a boil. Cool. 2. Blend prunes,

Use as a fat and egg substitute for cooking, baking and salad
dressings. According to the directions on the jar of the commercial
Wonderslim, 1/4 cup of WonderSlim replaces 1/2 cup of butter, oil or
margarine. Personally, I prefer using almost equal amounts. 1/4 cup
equal approximately 35 calories.
