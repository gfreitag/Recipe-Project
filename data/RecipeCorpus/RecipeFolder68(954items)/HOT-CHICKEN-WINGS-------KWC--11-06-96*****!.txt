Title: HOT CHICKEN WINGS
Categories: Poultry, Marinades, Sauce, Appetizers, Kwc
Yield: 28 Servings
MMMMM---------------------MIX AND SET ASIDE--------------------------
1 qt Texas Pete Hot Sauce
1 c  Soy Sauce
1 tb Granulated Onion
2 ts Granulated Garlic
2 ts Thyme Leaves
1 1/2 tb Crushed Red Pepper Flakes
MMMMM----------------------ADD TO THE ABOVE---------------------------
28 ea Chicken Wings(split)
Mix all the spices and Texas Pete.  Then clean and split the chicken
wings. Pour the sauce over and bake in oven for 1 hour at 300
degrees. Then remove the chicken from the sauce and place on rack
above a paper lined sheet tray. Return to oven and cook until chicken
has a dry like appearance. Then baste with sauce and return to oven.
Repeat this step until sauce is used up.  When half the sauce is used
try a wing and see if it is the flavor you want.  (This half way
point will smack your mouth and finish with a mild slow burn.  This
is what I call "red fire" appearance.) If wanting the real thing
continue until sauce is gone. The ckicken will have what I call a"
black fire" appearance.  This point in the process will grab your
lips and attempt to rip them off and then finish off with a pleasant
medium hot slow burn. Enjoy it.

You may want to try marinating them in the sauce overnight then
cooking off.  It could only get better doing them this way.
Note-11-15-96 I tried it marinating over night and it gives a full
deeper flavor. It didn't seem to be as hot this way.  I like both
ways.

This was in the making over a 5 1/2 year period.  This is it the real
thing.  Hot chicken wings without the buffalo. This is a limited
edition of wings; one taste and you will limit who you give them to
or eat all of them yourself.

Please do enjoy them and share them.
