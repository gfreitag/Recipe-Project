Combine first five ingredients in a shallow dish; stir well. Add
chicken, bell pepper, and onions; turn to coat. Cover and marinate in
refrigerator 1 1/2 hours. Drain chicken and vegetables; reserve
marinade.

Arrange chicken in a foil-lined steamer over boiling water in a dutch
oven. Cover and steam 10 minutes. Add bell pepper and onions. Cover
and steam an additional 6 minutes or until chicken is done. Remove
chicken and vegetables from steamer; place in a serving platter.

Place marinade in a saucepan over medium heat; cook one minute. Pour

**Editor note: Don't worry if the chicken looks a bit pink after
cooking; that is typical of steam-cooked chicken. It's thoroughly
cooked and safe to eat.
