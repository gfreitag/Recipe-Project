green beans or peas.

PLACE THE HOT CHILES, onion and vinegar in a food processor or
blender. Process until very fine. Pour the sugar into a heavy
non-aluminum pot. Stir in the chile mixture, bring to a boil, and
boil for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the pectin. Let
sit 5 minutes and then remove the foam with a slotted spoon. Ladle
into sterilized jars and seal. Turn the jars upside down occasionally
to keep the chiles mixed until the jelly is cool and set. This jelly
makes wonderful Christmas gifts too. Makes 10 Cups
