2 2/3 c  Warm water (110 degrees F.)
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/2 ts Sugar
6 1/2 c  Unbleached bread flour +
-more for kneading
1 tb Butter, melted
1/2 c  Dry milk powder
2 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 tb Salt
2 ts Baking powder
2 ts Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Warm water mixed with
2 ts Salt
This recipe is the closest I have come to the real bolillos of
Mexico. The secret ingredient is the cinnamon, which provides that
elusive Mexican taste.

Pour 2/3 cup of the water into a small bowl. Add yeast and 1/2
teaspoon sugar. Let proof about 10 minutes until bubbly.

Combine yeast mixture and remaining water in a large bowl. Whisk in 3
cups of the flour. Set in a warm place for 30 minutes.

Stir in butter, milk powder, sugar, cinnamon, salt and baking powder.
Stir in remaining flour; turn out on a lightly floured board and
knead for 10 minutes, adding additional flour, if necessary. Coat
dough with oil and return to bowl. Let rise until doubled in bulk,
about 1 hour.

Pour the salt-water mixture into a spray bottle.

Punch down dough and form into oblong rolls about 4 inches long. Each
bolillo should weigh about 4 ounces. Place on lightly greased baking
sheets that have been dusted with cornmeal. Let rise about 30
minutes, or until doubled. Slash tops lengthwise and mist gently with
the salty water.

Bake in a preheated 375 degree F. oven for 10 minutes. Mist again.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. and bake 25 minutes longer,
until rolls are golden brown.

Makes 12 bolillos.
