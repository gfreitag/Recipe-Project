Categories: Sauces, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Flour
3/4 c  Cold water *
- *for a richer sauce,
- use evaporated milk
3 oz Unsweetened chocolate
3 tb Butter or margarine
1 ts Vanilla
MIX THE SUGAR AND FLOUR IN A heavy saucepan, blend in the water and
heat, stirring constantly, over moderate heat until boiling and
thickened. Reduce the heat to low, add the chocolate and cook and
stir until the chocolate melts. Beat in the butter and vanilla. Cool
slightly, beating now and then. Serve warm. And here's something else
you might try. Simply begin your favorite fudge recipe, but cook the
syrup only to about 220F or 225F. Take it off the heat, cool maybe 10
minutes, then drop in the butter, add the vanilla and heat until
satiny. You couldn't get a more authentic hot fudge sauce than this!
