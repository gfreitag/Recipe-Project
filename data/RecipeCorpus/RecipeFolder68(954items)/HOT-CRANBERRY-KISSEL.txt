Title: HOT CRANBERRY KISSEL
Categories: Jams
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Lemon
3/4 c  Granulated sugar
3/4 c  Water
12 oz Fresh or frozen cranberries
1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
Kissel is a saucelike Russian dessert, usually made with one or more
red fruits (berries or plums) and often containing red wine. It is
wonderful with pancakes and waffles, and even better with a spoonful
of sour cream or yogurt on top.  The sauce keeps at least a week in
the refrigerator.

Directions:

Remove 3 lengthwise strips of peel from the lemon with a vegetable
peeler. Put the peel into a medium-size saucepan along with the sugar
and water. Bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring once or twice
to help the sugar dissolve.  Reduce the heat and simmer 5 minutes.

Rinse the cranberries (don't rinse frozen berries), and remove any
stems or squashed berries.  Add to the pan and when boiling, simmer
about 5 minutes until most of the skins have popped. Remove and
discard the lemon peel. Dip out about 1 cup of the popped berries and
reserve.

Puree the remaining berries and the syrup in a food processor or
blender and put back in the pan.  Stir in the cinnamon and the
reserved berries. Serve warm. Makes 2 cups.

SUMMER CRANBERRY SAUCE:  Make this when cranberries aren't available.
In a small saucepan, heat one 16-ounce can whole-berry crangerry
sauce, 2 strips lemon peel, and about 1/16 teaspoon ground cinnamon.
Simmer 5 minutes over low heat, stirring often, to develop the
flavor. Discard peel. Serve sauce warm. Makes 1 1/2 cups.
