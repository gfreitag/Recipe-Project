Title: HOMEMADE HERBED CHEESE
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Dips, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Spreads
Yield: 1 Batch
1/2 c  Packed fresh herbs*
2    Garlic cloves; peeled
-- coarsely chopped
8 oz Cream cheese; at room temp.
1/2 c  Unsalted butter
-- at room temperature
Salt and pepper; to taste
1    Squeeze of fresh lemon juice
*Choose a combination that includes chervil, chives, parsley,
tarragon, marjoram or basil.

Pick over herbs, removing any coarse stems; wash well and pat dry.
Place herbs and garlic pieces in a food processor fitted with a steel
knife. Process several seconds until minced. Add cream cheese,
butter, salt, pepper and lemon juice; process until very smooth.
Taste and adjust seasonings.

Spoon into a crock or small bowl; cover and chill to develop flavors.
Serve at room temperature as a spread for crackers or as a filling
for raw vegetables.

Note: The food processor yields quick results but, if ingredients are
at room temperature, this cheese can be blended by hand just as well.

To vary this and for fewer calories, substitute 2 cups of low-fat
cottage cheese for the cream cheese and butter.

Yield: About 2 cups.
