Hopping John is a traditional Southern New Year's dish. This is a
modern salad version.

PLACE BLACK-EYED PEAS in a large pot, cover with water and add 3 cups
more water. Add fatback or salt pork, slashed in several places, hot
red pepper, half the onion, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover,
reduce the heat and simmer until the peas are tender. Add more water
as needed. Remove the peas. Add rice to the pot of water and
drippings. Bring back to the boil, cover, reduce the heat and simmer
until the rice is cooked, about 30 minutes. Return the peas to the
pot, stir together and cook a few minutes more. Drain. Remove the
fatback and hot pepper. Add rest of chopped onion. Make a vinaigrette
of red wine vinegar, dijon mustard and peanut oil. Add salt and
pepper. Combine with the Hopping John, add chopped fresh basil and
bacon, crisply fried and crumbled.
