Title: HOT CROSS BUNS (SATTERLY)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Dry yeast
3/4 c  Warm water
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  White sugar
2 tb White vinegar
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Cinnamon
3 1/2 c  White flour
1/2 c  Flour for kneading
2/3 c  Currants
Combine yeast with water in a mixing bowl.  Combine the rest of the
ingredients except the currants & flour. Mix well. Add 1 1/2 c flour
& mix. Stir in currants. Mix in the remaining 2 c of flour. Remove
from bowl & knead, adding more flour as necessary. Knead for a few
minutes until the dough is pliable. Return to mixing bowl, cover with
a damp cloth & set aside until it has doubled.

Punch dough down, turn out onto a floured board, cover & let rest for
10 minutes.  Divide the dough into 18 pieces. Roll into a ball &
place on a greased baking sheet 1 1/2 inches apart. Flatten slightly.
If you wish, using a sharp knife, cut out a cross in the top of each
bun. Cover with a damp cloth & let rise till doubled.

Heat oven to 375F.  Lightly brush the top of each bun with vegetable
oil & bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden. Cool on wire racks.
