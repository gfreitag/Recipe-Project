Just mix it all together and freeze it according to your freezer
instructions.

This is for a gallon freezer so you will have to cut it in half for a
smaller freezer. You have to allow for expansion while it freezing so
don't fill the container too full.

If we are not going to be eating this right away I have found if I
add a small container of Cool Whip to it it keeps it from forming ice
crystals when we put it in cantainers to store in the freezer.
Usuallly we make it when we have family over and don't have too much
left.
