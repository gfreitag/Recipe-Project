Suzy's variation of Honey Cake II - Cooking with Memories by Lora
Brody

Preheat oven to 350 degrees with the rack in the center position of
oven. Grease and flour a 13 x 9 x 2-inch pan. Place the dried apples
and pears, the apple cider, the orange juice and grated rind in a
small saucepan and simmer until the apples have absorbed most of the
liquid. Set aside to cool slightly.

In the work bowl of an electric mixer or by hand beat the eggs and
sugar until thickened and pale yellow. Beat in oil and honey and then
coffee. Sift together dry ingredients (including cinnamon) and mix
into batter, mixing only until blended. Add the apple mixture,
raisins and nuts.

Bake for 1 hour until the center is firm and tester comes out dry.
Cool on a rack and then either invert onto a plate or cut into
squares in the pan. Dust with sifted Confectioners' Sugar.
