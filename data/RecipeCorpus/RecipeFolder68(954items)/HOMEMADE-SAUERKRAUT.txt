Title: HOMEMADE SAUERKRAUT
Categories: New text im, Cooking rig
15 lb (6-8 Firm Heads) Green
Cabbage
Yield: 1 Servings
:
3/4 c  Kosher Or Pickling Salt

Wash the cabbage thoroughly and trim away any bruised or damaged
leaves. Quarter and cut away the core and discard. With a food
processor, mandoline or knife, cut the cabbage into uniformly fine
shreds. In a large plastic tub, place half the cabbage and sprinkle
with half the salt. Mix and "massage" the cabbage and then let it
stand for 5-10 minutes. Juices will begin to come out of the cabbage.
Place this in your fermenting tub. Repeat this process with remaining
cabbage and salt and pack into tub.

The cabbage must be covered by juices to prevent spoilage. If there
is not enough juice to cover, make up some additional brine by adding
4 tablespoons salt to 2 quarts water, pouring over just to cover.

Be sure to keep cabbage submerged during fermentation. Cover tub
securely with plastic wrap and then cover that with a clean towel to
keep out any errant contamination.

Store in a 65-75 degree room and don't uncover for at least 3 weeks.
Remove towel and plastic wrap. There should be no bubbles of CO2 gas
evident in the brine (gently tap tub to check). If there is, recover
and check again in 2-3 days.

The finished sauerkraut should have a clean appearance with no white
spots or unpleasant or off odors. Texture should be firm.

Pack finished sauerkraut into clean jars and store in refrigerator
for up to 6 months.

Yield: Approximately 6-8 quarts
