Title: HOT RIBS
Categories: Pork
Yield: 1 Servings
3 lb Pork spareribs, cut in pairs
2 tb Peanut oil
1 ea Onion, chopped
4 ea Garlic cloves, minced
10 oz Chile sauce
1/4 c  Cider vinegar
2 tb Maple syrup
2 tb Molassis
1/2 c  Dijon mustard
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 ts Hot pepper sauce
1 ts Pepper, black, fresh ground
1/4 ea Lemon, seeded and diced
3/4 ts Cumin
1 ts Coriander
1/2 ts Ginger, ground
1/4 ts Paprika, hot Hungarian
1/8 ts Saffron, crumbled (optional)
Parboil the spareribs for 1-2 minutes.  This will result in a better
textured meat.  Tightly wrap each pair of ribs in foil and place on a
rack in a large baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.
Meanwhile, make the BBQ sauce.  Saute the onion and garlic in the oil
over low heat for 5 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients, mix
thoroughly and cook 10 minutes.  Remove the ribs from the over,
discard the foil, and brush both sides of the ribs with the sauce.
Return ribs to oven and bake, uncovered for 25-30 minutes more
