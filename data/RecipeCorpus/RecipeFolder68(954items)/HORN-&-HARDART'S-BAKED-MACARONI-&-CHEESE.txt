-Alyce Mantia (KRBS41A)
1 1/2 c  Shredded cheddar
1 c  Uncooked elbow macaroni
1/8 ts Cayenne
1 1/2 c  Milk
Salt/white pepper
2 tb Light cream
1/4 c  Finely chopped canned tomato
1 1/2 tb Butter
1/2 ts Sugar
1 1/2 tb Flour
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cook macaroni, uncovered, in 6 qts
rapidly boiling salted water 8-12 minutes until al dente. Drain well.
Combine milk and cream in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer.
Meanwhile, heat the butter in another saucepan over low heat just
until foaming. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Pour
the hot milk into the butter-flour mixture and cook, stirring, until
thickened. Add the cheese to the white sauce, about 1/4 cup at a
time,stirring until smooth. Add the cayenne and season to taste with
salt and pepper. Stir the tomatoes and sugar into the sauce.  Combine
with the macaroni and pour into a buttered 1-1/2 quart baking dish.
Bake for 25-35 minutes, until the top is nicely brown. Never having
been to a Horn & Hardarts, I will have to let you be the judge of how
authentic this is.
