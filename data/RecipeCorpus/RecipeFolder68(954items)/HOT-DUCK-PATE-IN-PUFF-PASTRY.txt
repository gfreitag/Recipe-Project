Remove meat from legs and breast of duck. Remove all skin and fat.
Marinate duck meat, pork butt and veal shoulder with nutmeg,
allspice, thyme, bay leaf, wine and garlic for 3 or 4 days in the
refrigerator.

Drain all the liquid and whole spices from the meat. Peel the garlic
cloves, and, with the marinated meat, run through a meat grinder on a
coarse setting. Mix the ground meat with the eggs, chopped truffles,
pistachio nuts, duck glaze, truffle juice, salt and pepper to make a
pate.

Form pate into twelve 2-inch balls. Top each with a small slice of
foie gras and a thin slice of truffle. Cut the puff pastry into 4
pieces. Roll each piece into a strip, approximately 20-by-4-inches.
Place 6 balls of pate, spaced at 3-inch intervals, on two of the
pastry strips. Brush egg wash on the pastry surrounding the pate;
cover with remaining sheets of pastry, pressing between the
individual balls. Cut around each pate with a large ring cookie
cutter, pressing to seal the edges. Place the sealed pates on a
buttered baking sheet. Decorate the tops with leftover puff pastry
(using egg wash as "glue"); then brush with egg wash. Bake in a 425'F
oven for 10 to 15 minutes.

Place the pates on serving plates and ring with Sauce Perigueux.
