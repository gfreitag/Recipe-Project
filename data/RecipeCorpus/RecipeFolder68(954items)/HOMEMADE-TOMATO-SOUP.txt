Title: HOMEMADE TOMATO SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 1 Servings
3 tb Melted butter
2 tb Flour
2 c  Cooked tomatoes or juice
1/4 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
2 c  To 3 c cups milk
Cook the butter and flour together for a few minutes, then gradually
add tomatoes and cook a few more minutes. Stir in remaining
ingredients and heat through, but do not boil. It's a lot like making
a thin white sauce with tomatoes, if that helps.
Your fellow servant,
