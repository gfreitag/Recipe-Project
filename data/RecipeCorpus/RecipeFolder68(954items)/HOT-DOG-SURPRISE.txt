Title: HOT DOG SURPRISE
Categories: Car food, Quick/easy, Kids!
Yield: 10 Servings
10 x  Hot dogs
x  American cheese (or boutique
-brand Wisconsin cheddar, if
-you have an expensive car),
-sliced into hot dog-length
-fingers
10 sl Bacon
Distance:  40 miles

At home or on the road, cut a deep slit in each wiener, and stuff with
fingers of cheese.  Then wrap on the diagonal, like an old bias-ply
tire, with the bacon. Seal individually in foil. These are great for
stuffing into those odd places on the engine where you can't fit a
turkey or a suckling pig.  Cook about 45 minutes, or until cheese is
melted and bacon is somewhat crisp.
