From The Bread Cookbook by Lena Sturges.  Heat orange juice to
lukewarm; add salt, shortening, 1/4 cup honey, and sweet potatoes.
Mix well and add yeast. When yeast is dissolved, add eggs and beat
well. Add flour; mix until soft dough forms.  Knead dough gently in
bowl.
Form dough into ball and put in a greased bowl. Cover and let
rise in warm place until dough is light and doubled in bulk (about 1
1/2 hours).
Combine butter, 1/2 cup honey, and pecans.  Spread over bottoms
of 2 greased 12- by 8-inch baking pans.
Turn dough out onto floured surface; divide in half and fit into
pans over honey-nut mixture.  Using two well-greased, sharp knives,
cut each pan of dough into 15 buns. Cover and let rise until doubled
in bulk (30 minutes).  Bake at 325 degrees for 25 minutes. Cool 5
minutes before turning out onto racks or serving plate. Yield: 2 1/2
dozen buns.
