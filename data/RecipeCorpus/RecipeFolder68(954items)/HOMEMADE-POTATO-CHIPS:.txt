Title: HOMEMADE POTATO CHIPS:
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables
Yield: 5 Servings
7 ea Medium Potatoes
1 x  Vegetable Oil or melted Vege
1 x  Salt, if desired
Scrub 6 to 7 medium potatoes (about 2 pounds) under cold running
water and peel, if desired.  Slice the potatoes as thinly as
possible, (thin enough to see through). As you proceed, place the
slices in a bowl of cold water to remove the starch.  The water will
turn white. Drain and refill the bowl, repeating this until the water
remains clear. Drain and let the potatoes dry.
Fill a heavy skillet or saucepan halfway with vegetable oil or melted
vegetable shortening and cook over medium heat until the oil crackles.
Place the potato slice into the hot oil, a few at a time being
careful not to overcrowd the pan.  When the potatoes are brown on
both sides, 4 to 6 minutes, remove from the pan and drain on paper
towels. Sprinkle with salt, if desired.
Makes about 180 chips, or enough for about 3 cups of dip.
