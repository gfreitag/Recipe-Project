Title: HOMEMADE POLISH SAUSAGE
Categories: Poland, Sausage
Yield: 1 Servings
5 lb Pork
, (not too lean, or
You'll have door-stops!)
1    Clove garlic, or to taste
2 tb Salt
1 tb Pepper
1 tb Morton Sausage Seasoning
Grind pork coarsely. Mix ground pork with other ingredients. Extrude
thru meat grinder on coarse setting again into natural casing,
twisting at desired link size. Freezes well, and is very aromatic. I
recommend multiplying recipe times 5 and make an afternoon of it, if
you're going to pull out the meat grinder anyway. To cook, simply
thaw and pan-fry in skillet for approximately 15 minutes on medium
heat until sausage is nicely browned and begins to 'split', or use in
your favorite recipe.
