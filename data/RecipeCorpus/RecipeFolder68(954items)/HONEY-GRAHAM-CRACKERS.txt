Title: HONEY GRAHAM CRACKERS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 3 Dozen
1/2 c  Butter

1/4 c  Honey
1    Egg, beaten

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Using a pastry blender or two knives,
cut butter into flour until mixture has the texture of cornmeal. Stir
in baking powder, brown sugar and cinnamon. Add egg and hot water and
mix until well blended.

Knead dough 2 or 3 minutes.  Set half aside.  Roll out into a square
about 1/8 inch thick. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Score dough

remaining half of dough. Cool baked crackers and gently separate into
squares.

NOTES:

*  North American crackers with graham flour, honey and cinnamon -- I
originally got this recipe from a newspaper and played around a bit
until I thought it tasted like Sunshine Honey Grahams. I've
occasionally used ordinary whole wheat flour when I didn't have any
graham flour and it still worked alright.  Graham flour is coarser.
Yield: Makes 36-40.

: Difficulty:  moderate (judgment required).
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
