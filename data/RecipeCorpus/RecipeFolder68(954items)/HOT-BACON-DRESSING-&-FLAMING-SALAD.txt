Title: HOT BACON DRESSING & FLAMING SALAD
Categories: Beverages, Sauces
Yield: 4 Servings
450 ml Tarragon vinegar
2/3 l  Bacon grease
225 ml Lemon juice
450 g  Sugar
225 ml White wine
50 g  Corn starch
50 g  Pesto
1/3 kg Chopped crisp bacon
1.  Combine the vinegar, bacon drippings, lemon juice and sugar in a
sauce pot and bring to a strong boil.

2.  Dissolve the corn starch in the wine, then add to the boiling
mixture.

3.  Throw in the bacon pieces and the pesto AFTER the dressing has
cooled completely. Chilled this should last a number of weeks.

Author's Notes: This is off the top of my head so...

At the Italian restaurant where I learned this recipe we didn't put
the bacon or pesto in until the time of preperation. Heat an amount
of the dressing in a pan. Pour 151 rum on the spinach leaves and
light. Extinguish the flames with the warmed dressing.

Difficulty    : easy. Precision
: measure ingredients.
