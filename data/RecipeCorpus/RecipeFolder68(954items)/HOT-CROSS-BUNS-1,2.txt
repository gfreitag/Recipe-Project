* : Use either spice mixture for the recipe, not both.

Heat water to just warmer than a baby bottle, but not hot (about 105
F). Disolve sugar in water, then sprinkle yeast on top and let stand
for 10 minutes until foamy. In a small bowl, warm milk and honey to
same temperature. Whisk in the oil, egg and egg whites.
In a large bowl, mix together the milk powder, whole-wheat flour, 1
cup of the all-purpose flour, salt, spice blend (only one of them),
raisins, currants and peel. Make a well in the centre of the dry
ingredients and stir in yeast and milk mixtures.
Gradually add 1 - 1 1/2 cups more all-purpose flour. When dough
comes away from the sides pf the bowl, turn dough on to floured
surface and knead for 10 minutes. Add more flour as needed to form an
elastic dough. If raisins or peel pop out of the dough as you knead,
just poke them back in and continue kneading.
Lightly grease a bowl. Shape dough into a ball and place in greased
bowl, turning to coat the ball with grease. Cover loosely with a tea
towel and let rise until doubled in size, abt 1.5 hours.
Punch dough down and knead into a ball.
Divide dough into 20 equal parts. By repeatedly tucking the sides
under and pressing up with your thumb, shape the 20 pieces of dough
into tight round balls and place on a well greased baking sheet.
Cover loosely with a tea towel and let rise until doubled in size,
abt 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 F. Just before baking and adding
cross, gently brush tops of buns with ligthly beaten egg white.

TOPPING: Mix flour and sugar and enough water to make a thick , smooth
paste. Spoon paste into pipping bag with a tiny hole snipped off
bottom corner. Pipe a cross of flour paste on to each bun. Bake buns
for 15 ~ 20 minutes,
