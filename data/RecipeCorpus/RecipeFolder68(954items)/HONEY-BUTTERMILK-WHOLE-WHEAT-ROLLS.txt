These rolls have a soft texture ands delicate flavor but a firm
crust. They look very inviting, deeply browned with a dusting of
flour. They make great moderately sized sandwiches.

Basic Sponge

In processor fitted with metal blade, mix Basic Sponge with butter-
milk, salt, honey and melted butter until smooth. Combine flours and
add to sponge mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, pulsing several times to
incorporate each addition. Process dough until supple, elastic and
sticking slightly to work bowl, about 1 minute, adding more water or
flour by teaspoon, if dough is too dry or too wet. Dough should be
very sticky, almost wet.

Transfer dough to large plastic bag, squeeze out all air and seal
tightly at top to allow room for dough to expand. Set bag in bowl and
let dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.

Divide dough in half. Cut each in half again, then quarter into 4
equal pieces, about 2 1/2 ounces each. Shape each piece into round
roll by pinching bottom of dough. Place 2 inches apart on large oiled
baking sheet, pinched-bottom down. Sprinkle with flour. Drape loosely
with plastic. Let dough rise in warm place until almost doubled,about
1 hour. If desired, use kitchen shears to make deep cross-stitch
slash in rolls.

About 15 minutes before baking put rack in middle of oven and set
oven to 400 degrees F.. Bake until rolls are deeply browned and sound
hollow when raped on bottom, about 20 minutes. immediately remove
from pan and place on wire rack. Makes 16 rolls.
