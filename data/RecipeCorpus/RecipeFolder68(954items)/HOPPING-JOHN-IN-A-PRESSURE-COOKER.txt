Title: HOPPING JOHN IN A PRESSURE COOKER
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Brown basmati rice
1/2 c  Wild rice
1/2 lb Frozen black-eyed peas
10 oz Bag frozen mustard greens
10 oz Bag frozen collard greens
5 1/2 c  Water
1 ts Basil
1 ts Garlic powder
1 ts To 1*T Old Bay seasoning
2 cn Stewed tomatoes with liquid
This is a variation of something my grandmother used to make with h*m
hocks. It's a long way from the original. This makes approx. 5 qts.,
enough to freeze half or feed a crowd.

Put the water in the cooker, turn burner to high. Stir in spices.
Rinse rices and put in cooker.  Throw in black-eyed peas, greens, and
stewed tomatoes. Bring to simmer with the top off, stirring
occasionally, until frozen stuff has thawed somewhat and greens are
separated. Lock the lid down, bring to high pressure. Cook at high
pressure for 30 minutes, remove from heat and allow natural pressure
release. Adjust seasoning if necessary. Tobasco sauce is a must on
the table.

I use an 8-qt.cooker, cut recipe in half if you use a smaller cooker.
