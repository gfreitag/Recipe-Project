Title: HOT HOLIDAY PUNCH
Categories: Beverages, Mc
Yield: 20 Servings
3 c  Apple juice
3 c  Orange juice
6 c  Cranberry juice cocktail
3/4 c  Maple syrup
2 ts Powdered sugar
1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
3/4 ts Cloves
3/4 ts Nutmeg
Cinnamon sticks
Cinnamon sticks are optional but make a very pretty addition as
stirrers in steaming hot mugs of punch. Combine all the ingredients
in a very large heavy pan, except the cinnamon sticks. Bring to a
boil and turn to simmer for few minutes. You can put the ingredients
in a crockpot after it has boiled and keep warm over low heat. Posted
