Categories: Condiments, Gifts, Holidays, Mustards
Yield: 1 Cup
1/4 c  Dry mustard; Colemans
1/4 c  White wine vinegar
1/3 c  Dry white wine
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
3    Egg yolks
You begin with dry mustard, adding vinegar for tartness and wine for
mellowness; then you cook with egg yolks to give the spread its
velvety smooth texture. You can season the mildly flavored mustard as
suggested, or leave if plain.

For gift-giving, package the mustards in jars and identify them with
decorative labels. In top of a double boiler, stir together mustard,
vinegar, wine, sugar, and salt. Let stand, uncovered, for 2 hours.
Beat egg yolks into mustard mixture. Place over simmering water and
cook, stirring with a wire whisk, until mixture thickens slightly
(about 5 minutes). Pour into small jars and let cool. Cover tightly
and refrigerate for up to a month. Makes about 1 cup.
