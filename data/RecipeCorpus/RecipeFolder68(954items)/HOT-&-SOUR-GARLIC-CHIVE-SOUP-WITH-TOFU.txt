NOTES : This recipe makes one Japanese Miso - a seawood and mushroom
flavored vegetable broth. Strain the broth and return mushrooms to
pot. Then add tofu, Chinese chives, and agar (a thickener made from
seaweed). Quick soup:  check the import section of the grocery. Buy 1
envelop (or box) Japanese Miso with Mushroom. Make according to
package directions. Taste and add red pepper flakes and a little rice
vinegar to taste. Add tofu and heat through. The packaged soup
contains the agar to thicken the broth.  Do add Chinese chive. (I've
used society garlic - well cleaned.)
