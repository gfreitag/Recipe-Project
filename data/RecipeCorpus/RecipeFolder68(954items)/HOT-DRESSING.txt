Title: HOT DRESSING
Categories: Sauces, Salads
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Olive oil
3 tb Balsamic vinegar
1 tb Red wine vinegar
1    Shallot; minced
1 ts Chopped basil
1    Garlic clove
The "hot" in this dressing is in reference to temperature, not
flavor, as it softens the tougher-leaved greens like radicchio.

DIRECTIONS: =========== Sprinkle a pinch of salt in a wooden salad
bowl and rub the garlic clove all over to season the bowl. Add the
salad greens. Heat oil, vinegars and shallots in a small saucepan,
stirring occasionally. Pour hot dressing over greens and toss gently.
Sprinkle salad with basil and toss again. Serve immediately.
