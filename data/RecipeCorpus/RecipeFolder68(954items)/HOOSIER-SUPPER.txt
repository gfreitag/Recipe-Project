1 lb Ground meat
1/2 c  Bell pepper, chopped
1/2 c  Celery, chopped

Brown the beef; drain excess fat.  Add green pepper, celery and
garlic. Saute until tender.  Stir in salt and pepper, eggplant (my
favorite), parsley, rice, oregano, soup mix, tomato paste and water.
Bring to a boil; cover and simmer for 20 minutes.  Pour into greased
casserole or baking pan.  Sprinkle with mixed bread crumbs, Parmesan
cheese and margarine. Top with ripe olives. Bake at 450 degrees for
15 minutes. (I usually omit the olives) Randy Rigg
