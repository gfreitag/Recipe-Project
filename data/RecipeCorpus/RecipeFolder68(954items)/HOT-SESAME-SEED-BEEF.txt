Categories: Meats, Stir-fry
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1 tb Rice wine
1/2 ts Sugar
2 ts Cornstarch
1/2 ts Baking powder
5 ts Sesame oil
5 ts Soy sauce
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
1 tb Sesame seeds
1 1/2 ts Hot bean paste
1 1/2 ts Hoisin sauce

MMMMM----------------------------BEEF---------------------------------
1 ts Minced ginger
2/3 lb Beef tenderloin
-flank
Peanut oil (2-4 T)
4    Lettuce leaves
-(or less; use
-bok-choy if you
-can get it)
Mix together all of the marinade ingredients.  Slice the beef across
the grain into thin, diagonal pieces (about the size of your smallest
finger). Marinate for about half an hour.

Heat the wok until a drop of water dropped into it dances around as it
boils. Add enough oil to coat the wok and saute the ginger. Stir-fry
the lettuce. Stir-fry the beef (in batches so the wok doesn't cool
down too much).

Reduce the heat.  Return the vegetables to the wok. Add the topping.
Stir around until everything is mixed and heated evenly. Serve.

NOTES:

*  Very hot, very simple, very good beef stir-fry -- This recipe has
been floating around for years back east, where it's also known as
Hot Flaming Death.

*  Also add any other vegetables that you feel like. Sliced carrots or
broccoli are especially nice.

*  Hot bean paste also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc. This
is the main "spicy" ingredient and should be handled with care. Vary
this ingredient to taste.
