DRAIN SOAKED BEANS, cover them generously with fresh water and bring
to boil. Boil vigorously about 5 minutes, skim off any foam that
rises to surface, then lower heat and simmer 30 minutes. Add 1/2
teaspoon salt and continue cooking until beans are tender, about
another 30 minutes. Taste as they cook to be sure they are as done as
you like them. Drain beans but reserve liquid. Warm small, heavy
skillet and toast cumin seeds until fragrance emerges. Add oregano,
stir about 5 seconds, then quickly remove them to plate so they don't
burn. Combine with cinnamon stick and cloves and grind to a powder in
electric spice mill. Heat oil in wide skillet and saute onion briskly
over high heat 1 minute. Lower heat to medium and add garlic, ground
spice mixture, ground red chile and salt to taste. Stir to combine.
Add 1/2 cup reserved bean broth and cook, stirring occasionally,
until onions soften. Add tomatoes and liquid, squash and enough bean
broth to cover. Simmer until squash is partially cooked, about 20
minutes. Stir in hominy, beans and diced chiles. Add more broth as
needed and continue cooking until squash is tender. Taste and check
seasonings. Serve garnished with cilantro and sour cream or shredded
cheese.
