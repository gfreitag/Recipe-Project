Title: HOT CROSS BUNS (CONT'D) 2/2
Categories: Breads
Yield: 20 Rolls  brown. Remove buns from oven and slide off pan on to wire rack over
sheet of waxed paper.

GLAZE: Whisk lemon juice and icing sugar together to form a runny bu
slightly thickened mixture, rather like skim milk in color and
translucence (glaze should not be so thick that it makes a white
coating, hiding the cross). Brush glaze over buns while they're still
hot (some icing will drip on to the waxed paper). If desired, wait 5
minutes, then brush on a second coat of glaze.

SPICE BLENDS: Just mix ingredients together and use as per recipe.

FROZEN DOUGH METHOD: With rolling pin, press dough into a large
rectangle. Sprinkle with raisins. Starting at long side, roll dough
tightly into a log shape. Slice log into 9 sections.
Form each section into a ball and place in square pan coated with non
stick spray. Cover with sprayed plastic wrap and allow to double in
size. Remove plastic wrap and bake at 350 F for 20 minutes or until
golden brown. Remove immediately to cooling rack.

TO MAKE ICING: Mix all icing ingredients together and place in a
squeeze bottle, icing bag or gun.
When buns are cool, use icing bag or snipped milk bag to squirt
icing in a cross design on top.
