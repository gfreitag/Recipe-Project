loaf (if using Welbilt/Dak machine, add 2 tb. more buttermilk as
well). Use 3 tb. buttermilk and 3/4 cup water for 1-pound loaf (for
Welbilt machine add 1 tb. more buttermilk). ** Use 4 teaspoons yeast
for 1-1/2-pound loaf IF NOT USING RED STAR BRAND. One-pound size loaf
measurement does not change. The egg and oats lend a wonderful rich,
creamy flavor to this bread. Serve it with a crock of sweet butter
and homemade preserves. Place all ingredients in bread pan, select
Light Crust setting, and press Start. After baking cycle ends, remove
bread from pan, place on cake rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before
slicing.
