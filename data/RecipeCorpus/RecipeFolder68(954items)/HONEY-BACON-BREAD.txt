2 ts Yeast
5 ts Gluten
3 1/2 c  Wheat flour
1/2 c  Honey
3 tb Soft butter
1 1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Soft bacon bits*
1 1/4 c  Very warm water + more if ne
* (don't use the crunchy kind) it looks too dry add a little more)
This is the receipt that was on the BB from CELESTE BEATIE (TDFX72B).
I don't deserve any credit for this wonderful bread.
Celeste used the DAK Auto Bakery and I use the DAK Turbo on the turbo
cycle. Turned out great. It is heavy (2 1/2 lbs.) I also used the
crunchy bacon bits but I soaked them in warm water for about 30
minutes. Only had to add 2 Tbsp of water to the 1-1/4 cup. All that
like this should thank CELESTE. FROM: C HAROLD QUINN (FPHK52A)
