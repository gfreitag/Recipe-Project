2 lb Beef spareribs;  (about 2 l
1 tb Soy sauce; divided
3 tb Dry sherry; divided
1 ts Ginger; minced
1 ts Five-spice powder
1 tb Cider vinegar
1 c  Soy sauce +
3 tb Hoisin sauce
1 tb Sugar
2 c  Garlic; minced
2 tb Honey
Have your butcher cut ribs in half lengthwise so that each piece is 2
to 3 inches long.  Cut between bones to make 6 inch pieces. Trim
excess fat. Place ribs in heavy plastic bag. Fro marinade, combine
l/4 cup of soy sauce, hoisin sauce, 2 tbls sherry, sugar, ginger,
garlic and five-spice powder in small bowl; mix well. Pour marinade
over ribs. Seal bag tightly and place in large bowl. Refrigerate 8
hour or overnight, turning bag occasionally. Foil line a large baking
pan. Place rack in pan and place ribs on rack (reserve marinade).
Bake in preheated 350F oven 30 minutes. Turn ribs over, brush with
marinade and bake until ribs are tender when pierced with fork, about
40 minutes more. For glaze, combine honey, vinegar, remaining l tlb
soy sauce and l tbls sherry in small bowl; mix well. Brush l/2 of
mixture over ribs; place under broiler 4 to 6 inches from heat source
and broil until ribs are glazed, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn ribs over,
brush with remaining honey mixture and broil until glazed. Cut into
serving-size pieces. I changed this recipe from pork to beef.
