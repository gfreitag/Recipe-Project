Title: HORSERADISH CRUSTED HALIBUT-MARTHA STEWART LI
Categories: Main dish, Fish/sea, Soup/stews
Yield: 4 Servings
10 tb Freshly grated or prepared
-horseradish, drained
1/2 c  Fresh white bread crumbs
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Chervil leaves
1 tb Tarragon leaves
1 pn Freshly ground pepper
2 ts Egg white
4    Halibut or other firm white
-fish fillets (6-8 oz each),
-skin removed
Salt
1 ts Olive oil
2    Bunches fresh spinach,
-washed well
2 tb Balsamic vinegar
1. Heat oven to 400'. In a food processor, combine horseradish, bread
crumbs, butter, herbs, and pepper. Pulse 2 or 3 times until combined
and herbs are coarsely chopped. Add egg white and pulse 2 or 3 times.

2. Season both sides of fish with salt and pepper. Pat 3 or 4 T of the
mixture firmly onto one side of each fillet. Heat a large nonstick,
ovenproof pan over medium-low heat. Add oil and fillets, crust side
down. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until crust is golden brown.
Carefully turn, then place pan in oven for 7 to 10 minutes, or until
done to taste.

3. While fish is baking, place spinach in a medium saucepan. The
spinach leaves should still have water clinging to them; if they
don't, sprinkle with a few drops. Add salt, cover, and cook over
medium heat, stirring occasionally, until just wilted, 2 to 3
minutes. Pour vinegar into a small saucepan and cook over high heat
until reduced by half, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.

4. Remove fish from oven. Serve each fillet with some of the wilted
spinach and a spoonful of the reduced vinegar alongside.
