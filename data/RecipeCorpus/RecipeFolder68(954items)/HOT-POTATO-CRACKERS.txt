Title: HOT POTATO CRACKERS
Categories: Bakery, Crackers
Yield: 65 Crackers
1 1/3 c  All purpose flour
2/3 c  Potato flour
2 tb Dried chives
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Black pepper, ground
1/2 c  Shortening
1/2 c  Water
Salt for the tops, optional
Paprika for the top, option
Preheat oven to 350F.

In a large bowl, combine the flours, chives, salt & pepper. Cut in the
shortening until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Slowly
blend in the water. Divide the dough into 2 equal balls. On a floured
surface, roll out into a thin rectangle 1/16" to 1/8" thick. Sprinkle
with salt & paprika & roll over with rolling pin.

Cut into 2" shapes with a sharp knife.  Prick each cracker with a
fork. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Some crackers
will brown more quickly than others, so watch carefully for the last
5 minutes or so. Cool on a wire rack.

Use as an alternative snack to potato chips.
