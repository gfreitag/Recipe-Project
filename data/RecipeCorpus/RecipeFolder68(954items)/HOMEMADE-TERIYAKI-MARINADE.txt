Title: HOMEMADE TERIYAKI MARINADE
Categories: Oriental, Sauces and, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Brown Sugar
1 c  Soy Sauce
1 c  Sake -- * see note
Fresh Ginger Root -- grated
Garlic Cloves --
Diced/pressed
* or dry white wine or vodka. put thin cut strip steak or chicken
parts (especially huge quantities of wings) in marinade and soak
overnight. Best if grilled on the BBQ, but can be baked (usual meat
350 F for an hour a lb.) For the truly lazy (we prefer to think of
ourselves as the "time-challenged", Italian dressing on a (cheap)
steak adds more variety to the flavor.  I can't verify any
tenderizing qualities, though. NOTES: The only marinade I've seen
that tenderizes the meat is a homemade Teriyaki recipe a college
roommate from Hawaii used. I think it was the high alcohol content.
