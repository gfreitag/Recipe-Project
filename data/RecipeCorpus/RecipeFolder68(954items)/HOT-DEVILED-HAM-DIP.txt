First prepare a place of crusty bread, cut in about 1 1/2 inch
cubes, trying to have every piece having some crust. Your choice of
bread.
For Dip:  Heat deviled ham, if any fat, drain it off. Add
cornstarch and thicken over very low heat. Continue to heat on low,
and add mustard, red pepper, onion and green pepper. Fold in sour
cream, keep heating just to a simmer.  Serve.  Fork up a piece of
bread and dunk it into the hot dip.
