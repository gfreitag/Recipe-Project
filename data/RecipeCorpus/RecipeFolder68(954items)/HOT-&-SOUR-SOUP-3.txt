Title: HOT & SOUR SOUP 3
Categories: Soups, Appetizers, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
8    Dried chinese mushrooms
8 c  Vegetable stock
8 sl Ginger, peeled
1/2    Lime, peeled & sliced thin
4 tb Lime juice
1 tb Lemon juice
2 tb Soy sauce
2    Chilies
1 lb Firm tofu, cut into chunks
Cilantro, chopped
Rinse the mushrooms, put them in a small saucepan and cover with
water. Bring them to a boil on high heat and swish the mushrooms to
remove excess dirt. Discard the water. Rinse. Once again, cover the
mushrooms and bring them to a boil, covered. Let sit 1 hour. Then
drain, remove tough stems, squeeze out excess water and slice or cut
in half. Bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan on high heat,
add the ginger and lime slices and cook for 2-3 minutes. Lower the
heat and add the lime and lemon juice, soy sauce and chilies. Simmer
for 5 minutes. Add tofu and mushrooms and simmer 5 more minutes.
Taste to check the balance of hot, sour and salt -- none should
overwhelm the other ~- and add more chilies, lime juice or soya sauce
as needed.

Serve garnished with chopped cilantro. Have a side dish of extra
sliced chilies for those who like it hot. Keeps a few days
refrigerated but it is best served fresh.
