Categories: New, Text, Import
1/2 c  dried currants
Yield: 4 Servings
2 TB brandy
3/4 c  firmly packed light brown
sugar
:
1/4 c  honey plus additional for --
glazing the buns if=
desired
:
:
1/2    stick (1/4 cup) unsalted
butter
:
1/2 c  chopped pecans
Cream biscuit dough, recipe
follows
:
:
2 ts cinnamon

In a small bowl let the currants macerate in the brandy and 1/4 cup
hot water for 20 minutes, or until they are softened, and drain them.
In a saucepan heat 1/4 cup of the brown sugar, 1/4 cup honey, and
butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until the sugar is melted.
Pour the mixture into an 8 1/2-inch round cake pan, and sprinkle the
pecans over it. Roll the dough into an 18- by 10-inch rectangle on a
lightly floured surface,=7F force the remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar
through a coarse sieve evenly over the dough, and sprinkle the
cinnamon and currants over the brown sugar. Beginning with a long
side roll up the dough tightly, jelly-roll fashion. Cut it into
1-inch slices with a sharp knife, and fit the slices cut side up in
one layer in the pan, pressing them down gently. Bake the buns in a
pre-heated 425 degree F oven for 20 minutes, or until a tester
inserted in the dough comes out clean. Run a thin knife around the
edge of the pan, invert the buns onto a plate, and reinvert them onto
a platter so that the plain side is up. Brush the top with the
additional honey, heated, if desired. (Or, if you prefer not to use
the honey glaze, invert the buns directly onto a platter, sticky side
up.)

Yield: 18 buns
