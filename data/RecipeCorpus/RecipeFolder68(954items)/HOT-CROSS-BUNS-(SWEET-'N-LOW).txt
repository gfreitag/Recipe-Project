1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar

1. In large bowl, mix sugar, Sweet'N Low, salt, cinnamon, yeast and 1
cup flour.

2. In small saucepan over low heat, heat margarine and 1 cup skim milk
until warm (120ø to 130ø F).

3. With mixer at low speed, gradually beat milk mixture into yeast
mixture. Increase speed to medium; beat 2 minutes. Beat in egg and 1
cup flour; continue beating 2 minutes. With wooden spoon, stir in
enough additional flour to make soft dough (about 2 cups). Add
currants and orange peel. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface.

4. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, kneading in
additional flour if necessary. Shape into ball.

5. Spray large bowl with non-stick cooking spray. Place dough in bowl,
turning to coat top. Cover and let rise in warm place until dough is
doubled, about 1-1/2 hours.

5. Spray two 8- or 9-inch square baking pans with non-stick cooking
spray. Punch down dough. Divide dough into 18 pieces. Shape each
piece into a ball. Arrange balls in pans. Cover and let rise in warm
place until doubled, about 1 hour.

6. Preheat oven to 375 øF.

7. Lightly beat egg white; use to brush buns. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or
until golden. Remove buns from pan; cool on wire racks 15 minutes.

8. Meanwhile, prepare icing: In small bowl, stir confectioners sugar,
vanilla and 3/4 teaspoon skim milk until smooth. Drizzle icing over
buns, forming a cross.
