Title: HONEY GRILLED PORK
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
1    3 lb pork loin
1    Can stale beer
6    Cloves garlic; minced
1/2 c  Honey
1/2 c  Dijon mustard
Salt & pepper to taste
1/4 c  Olive oil
4 tb Fresh rosemary
~ Place all ingredients (except pork) in a blender. Blend.
Pierce pork on all sides, place in a zip-lock bag, add marinade.
Chill, turning frequently, about 12 hours. Grill 1-1/2 hours,
covered. Start roast on high to brown for about 15 minutes. Turn heat
to low and baste frequently with marinade.  Remove from heat and
allow to rest at least 10 minutes before slicing. Throw additional
whole sprigs of rosemary on the coals while cooking...smells
wonderful. *This can also be done in a conventional oven. Posted by
