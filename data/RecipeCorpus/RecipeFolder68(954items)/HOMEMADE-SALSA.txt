4 lb Ripe, red tomatoes, peeled,
-seeded and chopped
2 c  Chopped red onions
4    Green onions, minced
1 tb Garlic, minced
1/2 c  Apple cider vinegar
6    To 8 jalapeno chiles, cored,
-seeded, minced
4    To 6 serrano chiles, minced
1 tb To 2 tb New Mexican red
-chile powder
1/2 ts Crushed cumin
1 1/2 ts Crushed dried oregano
1 ts To 2 ts salt
1 c  Crushed Pomi tomatoes (see
-note)
1/2 c  Minced cilantro
When I was working on this recipe many years ago, I bought about 20
bottled salsas, from mild to fiery, to try in the name of research. I
tasted them all. The one trait most of them shared was salt in great
amounts. By making your own salsa, you can season it to suit your
taste. Also, it's fun to vary the recipe by adding a variety of
chiles and spices.

Combine the fresh tomatoes, red and green onions, the garlic and
vinegar in a 5-quart saute pan; simmer for 10 minutes to reduce some
of the tomato liquid. Add the chiles, chile powder, cumin, oregano,
salt and crushed tomatoes. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat
and stir in the cilantro.

Store in a glass jar in the refrigerator or freeze in 1-cup batches.

Makes about 1 quart.

Note: Crushed Pomi tomatoes, sold in vacuum-packed boxes, help pull
the salsa together and thicken the juices.
