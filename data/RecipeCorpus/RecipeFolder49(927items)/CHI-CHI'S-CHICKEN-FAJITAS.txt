Title: CHI-CHI'S CHICKEN FAJITAS

In the last 17 years, I've worked for a LOT of restaurants
:)  My favorite trick was from Chi-Chi's [ha! I NEVER signed that
non-disclosure agreement] .... the absolute best marinade for chicken
(we used it for our fajitas) is margarita mix. Yes, just go out and
find your favorite margarita mix (Mr & Mrs T's is good) or a little
sweet & sour, put the chicken breasts in a shallow pan and cover with
the mix. Marinate at least overnight, preferably for 24 hours. NUMM!
