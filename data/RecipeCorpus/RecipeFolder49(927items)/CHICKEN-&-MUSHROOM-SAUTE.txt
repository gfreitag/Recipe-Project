2 tb Olive oil
1/4 c  Shallots; minced

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet.  Add shallots and
mushrooms and saute for about 2 minutes. Add the pepper, zucchini,
and 1 teaspoon thyme and saute until the vegetables are just barely
tender, about 2 more minutes.  Remove from the skillet and keep warm.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the skillet. Then add the
chicken and the remaining 1 teaspoon thyme; saute until the chicken
is done, 12-15 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and
combine with the vegetables.

To the juices in the skillet, add the vinegar.  Cook for a minute,
stirring up any browned particles clinging to the bottom of the pan.
Return the chicken and vegetables to the pan, along with the
tomatoes. Toss together for a minute or two to blend the flavors.
Season with salt and pepper. Serve at once.
