Title: CHERRY DELIGHT
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 20 Servings
1/2 lb Margarine
1 c  Sugar
4    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 cn Cherry Pie Filling or 1 lg
TOPPING:
2 tb Margarine
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Flour
Cream margarine and sugar, and beat until light. Add eggs, one at a
time, beating after each until well blended. Add vanilla, 2 c. flour,
and baking powder. Beat until light and fluffy. Spread dough evenly
on lightly greased 11x17 UTILITY or CAKE PAN--***MUST HAVE SIDES**.
(Note: I also use a small 8" cake pan with this) Spread top with
cherry pie filling. Sprinkle topping made by cutting and blending the
margarine, sugar and flour.
Bake at 350 about 25 mins or until edges are light brown. This is
also good with blueberry pie filling, or black raspberry. *Variation
is to use fresh cherries, drained and dried. Then press cherries
about an inch apart in the dough. ****WARNING---do not use my
mother's variation. She used a cookie sheet. Stuff went over sides
into oven and caused a FIRE. Oven was fine but dessert was not. Was
rushed and dumped in front yard. It burned a spot out of the lawn and
its identity resembled everything from burned bacon to um, dog
deposits!.
