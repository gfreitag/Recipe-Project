*Drain cherries well, reserving juice; chop very finely.

Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into the mixing bowl.
Drop in the shortening, add the milk, lemon extract, and almond
extract and beat 200 strokes. Scrape the bowl and spoon often while
mixing. Add egg whites and beat 250 strokes. Add the chopped cherries
and blend. Bake in two greased and floured deep 8" layer cake pans at
350 F. for 25 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. When cool, frost
with Cherry Fluff Frosting.

Cherry Fluff Frosting: Put egg whites, sugar, reserved cherry juice,
corn syrup, and salt in the top of a double boiler and mix
thoroughly. Place over rapidly boiling water and beat constantly with
a rotary egg beater until the mixture will hold a peak (about seven
minutes). Remove from hot water, add vanilla and almond extracts and
marshmallows and beat until cool and thick enough to spread. Double
the recipe to make enough frosting for the sides, too.
