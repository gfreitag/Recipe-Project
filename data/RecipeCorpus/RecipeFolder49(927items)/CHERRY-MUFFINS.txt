Here is a scratch muffin recipe that is as good as homemade blueberry
muffins.

Yield: 24 muffins

Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large mixing
bowl. In another bowl, combine the eggs, milk, almond extract, and
vegetable oil blending well. Add to the dry ingredients and mix only
to blend, if using an elelctric mixer, use low speed, about 30
seconds. Batter will still be lumpy.  Gently fold in the drained
cherries and chopped nuts. Spoon into well greased muffin tins
filling each about 2/3 full, handling the batter as little as
possible. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 25 minutes or until done.
