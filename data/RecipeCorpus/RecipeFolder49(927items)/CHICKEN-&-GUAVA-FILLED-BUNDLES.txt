*Guava paste is available in Mexican & Spanish groceries. If you
cannot find it, you can substitute the same amount of jellied
cranberry sauce. Place one chicken breast half between 2 pieces of
plastic wrap or waxed paper.  Working from center, gently pound
chicken with rolling pin or flat side of meat mallet until about 1/4"
thick. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts. In small bowl, combine
salt, oregano, pepper and garlic; mix well. Sprinkle evenly over
chicken breasts. Form guava paste into four 2 x 1/2 x 1/2" strips and
place one on each ham slice. Spoon about a tablespoonful of cilantro
over each strip of guava paste. Fold ham around guava and cilantro to
form a foll. Place one roll on narrow end of each chicken half; roll
up, jelly-roll fashion. Secure with toothpicks. Heat 1 T oil in
skillet over medium heat; add chicken rolls, seam side down. Cook
covered for 6 minutes or until no longer pink, turning once halfway
through cooking. Remove toothpicks.  Place chicken on paper towels;
pat dry. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Separate dough into 4 rectangles;
firmly press perforations to seal.  Place one chicken roll on each
rectangle. Fold dough over chicken; press edges to seal. Place, seam
side down, on ungreased cookie sheet. Cut slits in tops to allow
steam to escape. Bake for 13 to 18 minutes or until golden brown.
Meanwhile, in small saucepan over low heat, combine all sauce
ingredients; cook and stir until guava paste melts. Simmer until
sauce thickens. Place chicken bundles on serving plates; top with
sauce. Garnish with additional cilantro, if desired.  Serve
immediately. (2/3 cup sauce)
