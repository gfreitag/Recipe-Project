You can use any kind of meat (turkey, ham, beef, chicken). Lay
tortillas flat on cookie sheets.  Layer chosen ingredients on each
tortilla, beginning with meat, if any. Top with cheese. Put cookie
sheets into oven and bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees or until
cheese is bubbling. Remove from oven and serve immediately. This dish
is well-suited to substituting any left over meat and vegetables you
may have for those listed here. We like to use thin slices of celery
and mushrooms in place of the green pepper and zucchini. Makes 4.
