Title: CHEESE ROLLS - SMALL RECIPE - RED LOBSTER
Categories: Bread, Bread rolls
Yield: 12 Servings
Garlic salt -- or powder
Parsley flakes
Italian seasonings
2 c  Bisquick
1/2 c  Cold water -- scant cup
3 oz Sharp Cheddar cheese --
Grated
1 oz Butter -- OR margarine
My Notes: When the Red Lobster restaurant that we go to started
serving their cheese rolls, I managed to talk the manager out of this
recipe. It's been posted numerous times since 3/90 by me and by
Elaine Radis and others. The quantities I've given are as the manager
gave me. Later, I cut the ingredient quantities down to be more
useable by the average family. These do freeze, however, so it's
worthwhile making the larger batch and freezing the ones you do not
plan to use immediately.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
with garlic powder, parsley flakes and Italian seasoning. (Amounts
will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
Serve hot. The RL manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll
have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you desire.

NOTE: this recipe has already been reduced.
