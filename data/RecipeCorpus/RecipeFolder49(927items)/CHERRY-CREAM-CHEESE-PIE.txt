Title: CHERRY CREAM CHEESE PIE
Categories: Pies
Yield: 1 Pie
1    Pie shell
-(graham cracker)
8 oz Cream cheese
1/2 c  Sour cream
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla (or to taste)
4 oz Whipped cream
14 oz Cherry pie filling
-(1 can)
Cream together the cheese and sour cream.  Fold in sugar gradually.
Add vanilla and mix well.  Fold in whipped cream. Pour into pie shell
and chill for at least 3 hours.

Pour excess syrup from the can of cherry pie filling. Leave some, but
you certainly don't need all of it. The sauce should cover the cream
cheese mix, but the cherries shouldn't be drowning in it. Pour pie
filling on top. Serve cold.

NOTES:

*  A simple cherry cream cheese pie -- My wife makes this for me
periodically, and it is always delicious. No baking is required, and
it is very easy to make. Yield: Makes one pie.

*  If you don't have the time to sit around for 3 hours waiting for
the pie to chill, make the cream cheese filling the night before and
let the pie chill overnight.

*  We prefer to use non-dairy whipped cream substitute. We usually
use the same brand name ingredients for best results: Philadelphia
cream cheese, Breakstone's sour cream, Cool-whip and Comstock cherry
pie filling.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 3 hours chilling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK, especially with the vanilla.
