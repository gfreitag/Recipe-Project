Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Chicken
2 tb Veg. oil
2 md Onions
2    Cloves garlic
3/4    Inch piece fresh root ginger
1 ts Turmeric
1 ts Cayenne pepper

Cut the chicken into small pieces. Heat the oil and fry the finely
chopped onions, garlic and ginger. When they begin to turn color, add
the spices and cook for a few minutes longer. Now add the tomatoes
and salt to taste and cook for a further 5 minutes. Put in the
chicken pieces and stir so that they are thoroughly coated with the
sauce. Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes. At the end of this time
the mixture should be almost dry, but you need to check from time to
time and add a little water if necessary. from Favorite Indian Food
