Title: CHEESEBURGERS WITH AN ATTITUDE
Categories: Groundmeat, Beef, Cheeses
Yield: 2 Servings
2    Thick hamburger patties
-(pref. ground sirloin)
2 sl Blue cheese big enough
-to cover the  patties
2 sl Sweet red onion
4 sl Bacon, cooked until crisp
2 sl Tomato (optional)
Mayonnaise
Salt, garlic powder,
Coarse-ground pepper
2    Kaiser rolls, split
Preheat your grill, and toss on the hamburger patties and onion
slices. Grill until the onions are nicely browned and the patties are
done to your liking (medium rare around here). Add the split kaiser
rolls, cut side down, a few minutes before the burgers are done, to
allow the rolls to toast slightly.  When you put the rolls on the
grill, also place the blue cheese slices on top of the hamburger
patties.

Spread toasted rolls lightly with mayonnaise, top with the patties,
bacon slices, grilled onions, a tomato slice. Cover with the top of
the remaining half of the rolls, and chow down.
