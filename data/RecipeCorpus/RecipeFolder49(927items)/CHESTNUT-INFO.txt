Title: CHESTNUT INFO

Yield: 1 Servings  **** Chestnuts are versatile and low in fat.

One ounce of chestnuts contains 60 calories and 0.6g of fat.
Chestnuts are the only nut approved by the low-fat Pritikin System.
They are high in carbohydrates.

California's crop, grown around Sacramento, comes in during Sept, but
imported Italian nuts are here until the first of the year.

Substitute the nuts for other nut types in poultry and wild game
stuffings, breads or cinnamon roll recipes.

Fresh chestnuts must be cooked before being included in recipes. To
prepare them for baking, preheat the oven to 400 deg F. Using a
short-bladed or chestnut knife, carve an X onto the flat side of each
nut to prevent it from bursting.

Place the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast in the
preheated oven 15 - 20 min.  (They also may be cooked in the
microwave for about 5 min at full power.) The nuts should be mealy in
the center when pierced with the tip of a knife.  Remove immediately
from the baking sheet to a thick, clean cloth.  When barely cool
enough to handle, crack the nuts with your hands and use the same
knife to peel off the outer shell and then the funny inner skin.  (At
this point you may cover the whole nuts tightly and refrigerate until
needed.) Coarsely chop the nuts and set aside.
