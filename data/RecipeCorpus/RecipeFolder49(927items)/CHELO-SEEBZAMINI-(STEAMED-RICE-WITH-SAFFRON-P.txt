Categories: Rice
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Imported Iranian rice -- or
Substitute other
White rice -- soaked and
Drained a
1/2 ts Saffron threads
Pinch of sugar
1 ts Warm water
5 ts Melted butter -- plus 1 tbsp
Butter
1 sm Baking potato -- peeled and
Sliced 1/
In a heavy 3 to 4 quart casserole equipped with a tightly fitting lid,
bring 6 cups of water to a boil over high heat. Pout in rice in a
slow, thin stream so the water does not stop boiling. Stir once or
twice, boil briskly for 5 minutes, then drain in a sieve.

Meanwhile, with a mortar and pestle, mash the saffron and sugar
together to a powder. Stir in the 5 tbsp. of melted butter. Add the
potatoes and turn them about with a spoon until they are thoroughly
coated. Spread the potatoes out flat so that they cover the entire
bottom of the casserole and spoon the rice over them, mounding it
slightly in the center. Dot the top of the rice with the remaining 2
T of butter. Cover tightly and cook over high heat for 5 minutes.
Then place a sheet of aluminum foil over the casserole to seal it
completely and set the lid back in place. Reduce the heat to lowest
possible point and steam the rice and potatoes for 45 minutes, or
until tender.

To serve, spoon the rice in a mound on a heated serving platter.
Gently lift out the potato slices and arrange them browned side up on
the rice. Chelo Seebzamini is traditionally served with a khoresh or
stew.
