the cherries sit in the brandy for a couple of hours or even
overnight for the best flavor, then drain before using.

Cream the butter with both sugars, blend in the egg, vanilla and
almond extracts.

Fold in the salt, baking soda and flour.  Fold in the cherries, white
and dark chocolate and macadamia nuts.  Batter should be soft.

Drop in generous tablespoons onto the baking sheets, leaving space
between dollops of batter.

Bake until lightly browned around the edges 12 - 14 minutes.  Cool on
racks.
