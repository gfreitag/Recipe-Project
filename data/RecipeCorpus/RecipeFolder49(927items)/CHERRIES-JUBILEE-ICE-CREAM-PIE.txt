Title: CHERRIES JUBILEE ICE CREAM PIE
Categories: Ice cream, Pies
Yield: 8 Servings
1 qt Vanilla ice cream; softened
1 c  Marachino cherries;
- chopped & drained
1    Chocolate cookie crumb pie
- crust
8    Chocolate covered cherries
Whipped cream
Softened vanilla ice cream and add chopped marachino cherries, mix
thoroughly. Pour ice cream mixture into the pie shell. Freeze until
firm. Before serving garnish with whipped cream and chocolate covered
cherries.

I normally buy the half gallon size ice cream and make 2 pies. This
keeps well in the freezer.
