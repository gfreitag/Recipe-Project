Title: CHEESE SOUP (LANARKSHIRE)
Categories: Soups/stews, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 Servings
1 tb Finely chopped onion
1/2 pt (1 1/4 cups) hot water
1 pt (2 1/2 cups) milk
2 tb Flour
Seasoning    (?)    I use a
-touch of Herbes de
-Provence.
2 tb Finely grated Stilton cheese
A little butter or margarine

Fry the onion, without browning, in the butter or margarine. When
soft add the hot water; when the fragments of the onion are fully
cooked, add the milk to increase the measure to about a quart, and as
soon as it boils add in the flour mixed smooth with milk. Season to
taste, stir and simmer until it thickens.  A moment or so before
serving, mix in the cheese.
