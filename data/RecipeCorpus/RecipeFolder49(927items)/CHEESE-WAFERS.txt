Title: CHEESE WAFERS
Categories: Appetizers, Snacks
Yield: 60 Servings
13 oz X-sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 c  Butter
1/2 c  Corn oil margarine
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper (to taste)
3 c  All-purpose flour
Pecan halves (optional)
Grate cheese and mix with softened butter, margarine, salt and pepper
until light.  Add flour and mix thoroughly (you may need to get your
hands into the mixture to incorporate all the flour). Form the
mixture into 3 or 4 rolls, about the diameter of a quarter. Wrap each
in aluminum foil and chill overnight. The next day, cut into thin
slices and press a pecan half on top of each, if you wish.  Bake on
ungreased cookie sheet at 350ø to 375øF for about 15 minutes or until
the edges are lightly browned. Can be made 3 to 4 days ahead and
stored in airtight container.

Note: If desired, add 1 cup of finely chopped pecans to dough. Small
portions of the dough can be rolled into marble-sized balls, put on
ungreased cookie sheets, flattened with a fork and baked at 350øF
until lightly brown around the edges.
