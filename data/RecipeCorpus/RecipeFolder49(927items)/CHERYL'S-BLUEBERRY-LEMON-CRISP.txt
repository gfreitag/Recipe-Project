Title: CHERYL'S BLUEBERRY LEMON CRISP
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
6 1/2 c  Blueberries
1 1/2    To 4 teaspoons grated fresh
Lemon peel, depending on how
Tart you like it
A few pinches flour
TOPPING:
1 1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Flour
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 c  Butter, softened
Put the blueberries in a large but shallow baking dish. You can vary
the amount of blueberries by half a cup either way without making any
difference; 6 1/2 cups is what I happened to have on hand.

Lightly sprinkle a few pinches of flour over the blueberries to help
absorb the berry juice.  You can omit the flour if you want; if you
do, there will be more leftover berry juice in the bottom of the pan.

Sprinkle the lemon peel over the berries.  The tartness of fresh
lemon peel balances the sweetness of the berries and topping, so use
the amount that suits your personal taste. Then go change the name of
the recipe and put your own name in; you've customized it, you
deserve it! :)  Reduce the amount of lemon peel if you decide to cut
back on the amount of topping.

Mix together the remaining ingredients; it will be easier if the
butter and brown sugar are nice and soft. Sprinkle the mix on the
berries. Bake for 25 minutes at 275-degrees F.
