Title: CHEDDAR-ALE PUB SPREAD
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Old Cheddar Cheese, GRATED
8 oz Cream Cheese, SOFTENED
125 ml Ale or beer
1 ts Dry mustard
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 c  Finely chopped toasted
-pecans
1/2 c  Chopped parsley (fresh)
Place cheeses in food processor or blender, process until smooth. (I
used a combination of by hand and an electric mixer) Gradually add
ale, mustard and cayenne pepper. If mixture is soft, refrigerate
until firm enough to hold shape.  Mould into a disc shape ( a sphere
or ball!!). Combine pecans and parsley.  Pat the mixture onto the
ball or roll the ball in the mixture until the cheese mixture is
covered completely. Place on a serving plate or board and surround
with crackers or flatbreads. Slices of apple are nice with this too.

This is an easy thing to make and is very tasty.
