Categories: Swiss, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
250 g  Dried chestnuts
3 dl Milk
85 g  Sugar
10 g  Vanilla sugar
50 g  Butter
1/2 dl Grappa
3    Egg yolks
4    Egg whites, stiffly beaten
Sugar and butter for the
-- souffle dish
Soak the chestnuts for 12 hours in cold water and drain (dried
chestnuts are used because they have a stronger flavour than fresh
ones). Cook with the milk for 20 minutes on a very low heat and then
make a puree. Mix together with the softened butter, sugar, vanilla
sugar and the grappa (brandy, if you don't have grappa). Add the egg
yolks one by one, mixing well. Leave to cool then fold in the beaten
egg whites. Put the mixture into a buttered and sugared souffle dish
and bake at 180-190 oC for about 40 minutes. Dust with icing sugar
and serve immediately, with a little whipped cream, if desired.
