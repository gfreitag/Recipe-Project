Here is a genuine Fake Chinese Recipe.

Powdered Sugar Or Cinnamon Sugar

To assemble wontons, place approximately 1 1/2 Tsp Cherry Pie Filling
(2 cherries plus sauce) in the center of each wonton wrapper. Mositen
the edges of each wrapper, bring one corner up over the filling to
the opposite corner at an angle so that two overlapping triangles are
formed. Pull the two bottom corners of the folded triangle forward so
that they meet one another and slighly overlap. Moisten one end and
pinch the two ends firmly together.  Repeat.

Pour the oil into a deep fryer and heat to 375 degrees F. Deep fry the
wontons, 8 to 10 at a time for about two minutes or until crisp and
golden. Drain on paper towels.

Fried wontons can be kept warm for about one hour in a 250 degree F.
oven or reheated for 5 minutes in a 450 degree F. oven. Powdered
sugar or cinnamon sugar can be sprinkled on the fried wontons, if
desired.

NOTE:  Cherry dessert wontons can be assembled and frozen. To use,
let thaw for 10 minutes and fry as above.
