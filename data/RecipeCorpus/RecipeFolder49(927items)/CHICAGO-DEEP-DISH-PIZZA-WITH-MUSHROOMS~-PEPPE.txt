Directions: Dissolve sugar and yeast in warm water in a small bowl;
let stand 5 minutes. Place flour, 1/2 cup cornmeal, and 1/4 teaspoon
salt in a food processor, and pulse 2 times or until blended. With
processor on, slowly add yeast mixture and 1 tablespoon of oil
through food chute; process until dough forms a ball. Process for 1
additional minute. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and
knead lightly 4 to 5 times. Place the dough in a bowl coated with
cooking spray, turning dough to coat top. Cover the dough, and let
rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 45 minutes or
until doubled in bulk.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Add bell pepper, onion, and crushed garlic, and saute for 5 minutes.
Add mushrooms, dried oregano, and 1/4 teaspoon salt; saute 3 minutes
or until tender. Remove from heat; let cool.

Punch dough down; cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Divide dough in
half. Roll each half of dough into an 11-inch circle on a lightly
floured surface. Place the dough into 2 (9-inch) round cake pans
coated with cooking spray and each sprinkled with 1 tablespoon
cornmeal; press dough up sides of pan. Cover and let rise 20 minutes
or until puffy.

Spread half of vegetable mixture over each prepared crust, and top
each with half of the crushed tomatoes. Sprinkle cheeses evenly over
pizzas.

Bake at 475 degrees for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375
degrees, and bake an additional 15 minutes. Cut each pizza into 8
wedges. Garnish with oregano sprigs, if desired.
