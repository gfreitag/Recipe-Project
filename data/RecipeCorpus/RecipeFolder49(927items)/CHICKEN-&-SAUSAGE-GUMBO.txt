Cut up chicken, remove skin if ya like. Dredge the chicken with
flour salt and pepper. Fry the chicken until brown. Slice up a pound
of the link sausage... for a hotter sausage, try the Louisiana
'Andouie', if available. After the chicken is browned, place sausage
in the same skilett... use a heavy iron one. Brown the sausage, on
both sides. Save the grease from chicken and sausage.
Fry the tomatoe, onion and okra in about 2 T shortening or oil,
until they become tender.
Make a roux with 2 ts oil and 2 ts flour, stir and brown over a
medium-low heat until the roux is as dark as possible without burning
it. Do not burn the roux... just make it real dark.
Place chicken and sausage in the roux, stir a bit. Then place all
ingredients into a heavy, deep iron pan, add water and cook about 2
hours. Cook slow, add water if needed. The okra will thicken the
gumbo as it cooks. 
