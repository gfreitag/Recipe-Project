Hi again. This recipe was given to me by a chef friend at the Haiku
Gardens Restaurant in Kaneohe on the Island of Oahu, Hawaii. Have
made it often. This restaurant is right out of "RAIN"" by Sommerset
Maugham. It overlooks an awesome valley surrounded by the Koolau
mountains. The royalty, Alii, used the valley as their exclusive
summer hide away from the heat of the other side,leeward side, of the
Island. I lived very near to it and in the Valley for a number of
years. Place slivers of garlic along the bones and the base of the
rack. Salt and pepper all over. Heat small amount of oil in a skillet
to very hot and quickly brown meaty top side of rack only. Don't
allow it to cook or burn. Place rack in a baking dish. While oven is
preheating to 350* to 375*, make sauce. SAUCE: Heat to just below
boiling point while stirring constantly Use to baste rack and as a
sauce to serve with it. I usually doubled the recipe to have enough.
Place baking dish on center rack of preheated oven. Pour 1/2 of the
sauce over rack of lamb. Cook for about 20+ minutes but usually not
more than 25 minutes per pound. Serve and accept the ovations from
family and friends. BTW, this sauce makes a very good barbecue sauce.
That's it, after posting these two recipes for rack of lamb I am out
of here to get one for myself.:):) Really. I will post one last one
later for you Elaine and other lamb lovers. It is nice to be able to
get good lamb all year round now.
