Title: CHEROKEE SUCCOTASH
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 68 Servings
2 lb Fresh or dry Lima beans*
*(small ones are best)
3 c  Fresh corn cut from cob
4    Wild onions or pearl onions
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
2 tb Melted bacon fat
2    Pieces smoked ham hock
3 qt Water
Soak beans, if using dry ones, for 3-4 hours. Bring the water to a
boil then add the beans. Cook at a moderate boil for 10 minutes then
add the corn, ham hocks, salt & pepper, and onions. Reduce heat and
cook for 1 hour on a low heat. Got this one from a friend from grad
school. He is a cultural anthropologist who also happens to be a
Cherokee Amerindian. His passion is cooking and this is a recipe that
he assures me is genuinely ethnic to his people in North Carolina.
The changes from the items *'d are his not mine. The measurements
have been converted for us as well. He claims we would like to
measure out a hand- ful of this and a small pinch of that. Enjoy!
