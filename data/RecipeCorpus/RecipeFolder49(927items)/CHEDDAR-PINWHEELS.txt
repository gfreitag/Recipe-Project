Title: CHEDDAR PINWHEELS
Categories: Breads, Cheese
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Unbleached flour; sifted
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 c  Butter
2/3 c  Milk
1 c  Cheddar; extra sharp, grated
Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl and
then cut into the butter.  Add the milk and stir together quickly but
thoroughly.  Turn out on a floured board and knead for 30 seconds
then roll out to a 1/8-inch thickness.  Spread with the grated cheese
and roll up tightly like cinnamon rolls. Cut into 3/4-inch slices and
transfer to baking sheets and bake in a moderate oven (375 degrees
F.) for 20 minutes or until delicately browned.
