Title: CHEVRE & WALNUT SAUCE
Categories: Pasta, Poultry, Cheese
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Half and half
8 oz Plain chevre
2    Cloves garlic -- minced
3/4 c  Coarsely chopped toasted
Walnuts
1/3 c  Finely chopped parsley
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper -- to taste
1. In a medium saucepan combine half-and-half, chevre, and garlic.
Heat, stirring until mixture is creamy and smooth. Bring to a boil.
2. Boil gently about 10 minutes to thicken sauce and reduce it to
about 2-1/4 cups. Stir occasionally at first, then frequently the
last few minutes to prevent scorching. 3. Remove from heat; stir in
walnuts and parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Use
immediately or cool to room temperature and refrigerate or freeze
(see Timesaver Tip). 4. To serve: Cook 1-1/4 to 1-1/3 pounds fresh or
frozen fettucine, or 12 ounces dried, following package directions.
Drain. Toss with sauce. Makes 2-1/4 cups (4 main-dish or 6 appetizer
servings). * Timesaver Tip: Sauce can be made up to 6 hours ahead,
covered and refrigerated, or it can be frozen. To freeze, spoon into
a freezer container, cover, label, and freeze at 0 degrees F up to 1
month. To serve, defrost sauce 12 to 18 minutes in microwave oven on
Defrost setting, stirring several times, or thaw in refrigerator 8 to
24 hours. Gently warm sauce in a saucepan, or in a microwave oven on
50% power until warmed through, 3 to 5 minutes, whisking vigorously
and frequently to bring sauce to a creamy consistency.
