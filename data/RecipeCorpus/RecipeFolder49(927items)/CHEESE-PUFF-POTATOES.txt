When you're cooking baked potatoes for yourself, throw an extra one
in the oven to make this for baby.  And, if you have a baby who is
allergic to eggs, just skip the eggs and double the amount of milk.

Scoop potato out and mash in a bowl.  Whip egg in a separate bowl and
add to potato mixture.  Beat in butter, milk, cheese and add wheat
germ. Carefully spoon back into potato shell, and fold a small piece
of foil around bottom of potato to prevent leakage.

Place in preheated, 350 o oven for 15 minutes.

To make ahead, cover and refrigerate without baking. When ready to
serve, place uncovered potato in 350 o oven for 20 minutes.
