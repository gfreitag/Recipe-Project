Title: CHEEZE SAUSE SUBSTITUE
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Oil
2    3 tablespoons flour
1 c  Skim milk or soy milk
1 tb Nutritional yeast
x  Salt, pepper
x  Mustard
Cook and stir to a paste. At this point I add skim milk, about a cup.
A cup of soy milk, or a cup of a mixture of nut butter and water
coould be substituted. Add a tablespoon or so of nutritional yeast.
Flavor to taste, I use salt, pepper, and a little good mustard. I am
assuming you know how to work up a fat/flour mixture with added
liquid to make a thickened sauce. My version isn't vegan but has the
advantage of being relatively low-fat.
