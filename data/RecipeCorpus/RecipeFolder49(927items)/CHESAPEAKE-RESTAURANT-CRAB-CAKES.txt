Title: CHESAPEAKE RESTAURANT CRAB CAKES
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Lump crabmeat, cooked
1 ea Egg, beaten
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Parsley, chopped
1/4 ts Dry mustard
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
1/4 ts Worcestershire sauce
1 c  Bread crumbs
6 tb Butter
I personally like to add 1 ts of Old Bay seasoning to this and cut
back a little on the salt.

Trying to preserve whole pieces of crabmeat, combine first 8
ingredients in medium bowl. Using 1/3 - 1/2 cup for each cake, shape
mixture into 6 cakes. Gently coat cakes with breadcrumbs; place cakes
on plate and refrigerate 2 hours. Melt butter in 10" skillet. Brown
crab cakes in butter until golden on both sides and heated through.
Cakes will keep in refrigerator 3-4 days and in the freezer 2 months.
To reheat, wrap in foil and warm in preheated 325 degree oven for 10
minutes or refry in a skillet with a little butter.
