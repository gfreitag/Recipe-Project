Title: CHICKEN & RICE WITH CHIPOTLE
Categories: Chile-heads, Chicken
Yield: 2 Servings
1 c  Rice (I normally use Uncle
B's long grain)
2 1/2 c  Water
2    Chicken breasts -- boned and
Trimmed,
Or equivalent
2 tb Oil for frying
2    Dry chipotle peppers (at the
Least - you
May want more)
1/2    Green bell pepper
1/2    Red bell pepper
1/2 md Onion
2    Cloves garlic
1/2 ts Cumin -- pref. whole seed
Coarsely ground
1/8 ts Tumeric for color
Bouqet of herbs such as
Oregano or
Whatever is available -
Experiment!
Salt to taste
First, do the prep work:  Cut onion and bell peppers into
fingertip-size pieces.  Tear chipotle peppers into thumbnail-size
pieces (if you are serving non- chile heads, tear the chipotle into
bigger pieces, so they can fish it out and put it on your plate).
Cut the chicken into big nuggets. Mince the garlic.  Crush the cumin.
Cook the rice with the water, according to package directions. I
recommend that you avoid the more convenient varieties, which come
out looking like chromosones. I like the usual long-grain, but you
could also use a package of "wild" rice or some kind of mix of
whatever you like.   Add the tumeric and chipotle pepper, and stir
occasionally. When rice is nearly done, quickly fry the chicken, bell
peppers, garlic and onion. The chicken should be cooked through, and
it's also nice to brown it a bit. Combine all ingredients in the rice
pot for the last moments of rice cooking. Add the herbs and stir. If
necessary, you can hold the finished mix in the pot for some time ~
it's handy when you have to round everybody up to the table. Eat, get
on a horse, and ride into the sunset. (Well, that last part worked
for me in southern Wisconsin in '94.) Alex Silbajoris
