This qualifies as a savory; a bit of a change from the usual scone.

Preheat oven to 425F (220C).  Lightly grease a large baking sheet; set
aside.  Sift all-purpose flour, baking powder, dry mustard and salt
into a large bowl. Stir in the whole-wheat flour. With your fingers,
rub in cold butter until mixture is crumbly.  Stir in 1/2 cup cheese.
Make a well in center of mixture; add milk and mix with a fork to
make a dough that BARELY holds together (you may need to press dough
together with your hands). Turn out onto floured surface and knead
lightly. Roll out with a floured rolling pin or pat dough with your
hands to make a round about 3/4-inch thick. Cut into rounds with a
2-inch fluted or plain cookie cutter. Place 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart
on baking sheet; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Bake 8-10
minutes or until well risen and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to
cool.  When cold, split and serve with butter. Makes about 12 scones.
