Categories: Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
1/3 lb Dried chick peas
4 tb Olive oil
1    Onion, chopped
2    Ribs celery, diced
2    Carrots, diced
1    Leek, white and pale green
-parts, thinly sliced
2    Cloves garlic, chopped

2 ts Tomato paste
7 c  Chicken broth
1    Zucchini, chopped

Soak the chick peas overnight in plenty of cold water; the next day
drain the chick peas and rinse under cold water. Set aside. Place the
oil and onion in a soup kettle, set over low heat and cook slowly
until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes.  Increase the heat to
medium, add the celery and stir-cook for 1 minute. Add the carots and
stir-cook for 1 minute; add the leek and stir-cook for 1 minute.  Add
the garlic and cabbage, stir, cover the pot and cook for 2 minutes.
Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, and broth. Dump in the chick peas.
Bring the soup base to a boil; boil for 3 minutes.  Cover and simmer
for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until chick peas are completely tender. (The
soup may be prepared in advance to this point.)

To finish the soup, add the zucchini and elbow macaroni to the
simmering soup.  Cover and continue to simmer for 12 minutes, or
until the macaroni is al dente and the zucchini is cooked through.
Season with salt and freshly-ground pepper to taste.  Ladle the soup
into warm bowls and serve piping hot.

Makes 6 servings.
