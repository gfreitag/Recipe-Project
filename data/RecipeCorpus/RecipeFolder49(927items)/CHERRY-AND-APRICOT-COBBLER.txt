For the crust: Place flour in a bowl and rub in butter until fine and
mealy. Do not allow to become pasty. Stir in 1 cup of the buttermilk,
adding the remainder if necessary. Press dough together on a floured
surface, wrap in plastic wrap and allow to rest while preparing
filling. FOR THE FILLING: Combine apricots and cherries in a bowl and
toss with sugar. Pour into a large gratin dish or other shallow
baking dish. Dot with butter and sprinkle evenly with the almond
extract. Press the dough out on a floured surface until roughly the
size of the baking dish. Lift dough onto filling and cut several vent
holes in top. Brush with buttermilk and sprinkle with sugar. Bake the
cobbler about 20 minutes, until crust is well colored and filling is
bubbling. Cool slightly on a rack and serve warm or at room
temperature with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
