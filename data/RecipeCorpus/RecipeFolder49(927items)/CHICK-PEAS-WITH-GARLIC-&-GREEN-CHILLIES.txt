Title: CHICK PEAS WITH GARLIC & GREEN CHILLIES
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
4    To 6 cloves of garlic,
Crushed or minced
1/2 ts Cumin seeds
x  Stock or sherry for
Sauteeing
1 tb Tomato paste, mixed with
3 Tb water
1    15 oz can chick peas,
Drained
1    Medium-large potato, peeled
And diced
1/2 c  Water
1/2 ts Salt
1    To 2 fresh green chillies,
Chopped
1/2 ts Ground cumin
x  Few drops lemon juice
x  Cayenne pepper, if you like
It hot....
Sautee the cumin seeds and garlic in stock or sherry for 2 mins, then
add the diluted tomato paste and cook for 1 minute longer. Then add
the chick peas, water, potato, salt, green chillies, ground cumin,
and lemon juice. I find that one green chilli makes this pleasantly
spicy, but if you like it hot, add cayenne pepper or chili powder at
this stage. Simmer for 20 mins. Serve with bread; I like pitta bread,
but crusty bread or tortillas work just as well.

Adapted from Madhur Jaffrey's _Eastern Vegetarian Cooking_. These
quantities serve two, but you can easily double or quadruple them.
