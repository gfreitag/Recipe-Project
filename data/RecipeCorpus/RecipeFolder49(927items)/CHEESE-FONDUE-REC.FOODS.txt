Yield: 1 Qt

In a covered plastic bowl, mix cheeses and toss with a small handful
of flour to coat (this helps the cheese to melt nicely without
clumps). In a fondue pot (or sauce pan if you don't have one), bring
the beer to steaming, but not boiling.

Slowly mix in cheese, stirring constantly.  If you have too much
cheese, and the sauce becomes too thick, you may need to add a little
more beer to thin it to your taste. Add garlic, worc. sauce, mustard,
and salt and pepper.  Mix very well.

Turn your fondue pot or saucepan to low and dip away!

Use this delicious cheese sauce to dip:
Bread Chunks(rye, french, italian, pumpernickel, or any other kind)
Apple pieces (MacIntosh and Granny Smith work really well)
Carrot slices
Cauliflower florets
Any other raw vegetable you can think of!

Be careful!  As you near the bottom of the pot, the cheese is VERY
hot. Walt MM
