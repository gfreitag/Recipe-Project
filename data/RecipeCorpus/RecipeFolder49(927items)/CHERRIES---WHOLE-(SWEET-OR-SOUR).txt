Title: CHERRIES - WHOLE (SWEET OR SOUR)
Categories: Fruits, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 17-1/2 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 11 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
A lug weighs 25 pounds and yields 8 to 12 quarts--an average of 2-1/2
pounds per quart.

Quality: Select bright, uniformly colored cherries that are mature (of
ideal quality for eating fresh or cooking).

Procedure: Stem and wash cherries. Remove pits if desired. If pitted,
place cherries in water containing ascorbic acid (See "Ensuring
High-Quality Canned Foods") to prevent stem-end discoloration. If
canned unpitted, prick skins on opposite sides with a clean needle to
prevent splitting. Cherries may be canned in water, apple juice,
white-grape juice, or syrup. If syrup is desired, select and prepare
preferred type as directed.

Hot pack--In a large saucepan add 1/2 cup water, juice, or syrup for
each quart of drained fruit and bring to boil. Fill jars with
cherries and cooking liquid, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.

Raw pack--Add 1/2 cup hot water, juice, or syrup to each jar. Fill
jars with drained cherries, shaking down gently as you fill. Add more
hot liquid, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process.

Processing directions for canning cherries in a boiling-water, a
dial, or a weighted-gauge canner are given in Table 1, Table 2, and
Table 3.
