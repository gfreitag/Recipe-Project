the bowl and let cool for 10 minutes.

baking sheet near bowl before beginning next step.

all of eggs to dough. Mash by hand until eggs are completely
mixed. Add cheese and mix thoroughly.
Place ball of dough in center of ungreased baking sheet. Spread
dough from center to form a 5 x 8 inch oval ring.
