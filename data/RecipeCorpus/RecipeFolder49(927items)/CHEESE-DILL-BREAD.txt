Title: CHEESE DILL BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1    (1-lb) loaf of white bread
- defrosted according to
- package directions
1 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tb Chopped fresh dill
Flour; for kneading into
- the bread, as needed
1    Egg; mixed with
1 tb Milk or water; for the glaze
1/4 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
- for topping
ONCE THE DOUGH IS DEFROSTED, knead it along with the cheese and dill
on a lightly floured work space. Knead until well mixed, adding small
amounts of flour, as needed, to keep the dough from sticking. Form
into a log about 9 inches long. Put log on a cookie sheet lined with
parchment or lightly greased. Cover with a towel and allow it to rise
in a draft-free place until doubled in size, about 25 to 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375F. Place the pan on middle rack of oven
and bake for about 20 minutes, or until lightly golden. Brush the top
with the glaze and sprinkle on the remaining cheese, then return the
bread to the oven for 5 minutes until the cheese is melted, and the
bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove the bread from
the oven, and let it cool on a rack before slicing it. Makes 1 Loaf
