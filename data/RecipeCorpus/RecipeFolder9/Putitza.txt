One of Italy's very special Christmas and New Year's dishes is this rich
nut-and-fruit pastry, sometimes spelled "Putitza" or "Putizza."

DISSOLVE THE YEAST in 1/4 cup milk. Add 1/2 cup flour and knead into a soft
ball. Cover this with a towel and let it rise in a warm place. When it has
doubled in bulk, add it to a bowl containing the rest of the flour, the
sugar, eggs, melted butter, pinch of salt and grated lemon peel. Mix in
enough milk to make a supple dough; knead well. Cover with a towel and let
rise until doubled in bulk. Put the raisins in a small bowl and cover with
hot water; let soften, then drain.

Saute breadcrumbs in 3 tablespoons butter. Finely chop walnuts, almonds and
candied fruits. In a large bowl, mix together the raisins, pignoli, grated
lemon and orange peel, chopped nuts and fruits, sauteed breadcrumbs and 1
egg yolk. Whip the egg white into soft peaks and fold it into the mixture.
Preheat oven to 375F. Butter a baking sheet. Roll dough into a sheet
1/8-inch thick. Spread filling over it, leaving 1 inch clear at the edges.
Roll it into a cylinder and coil it on the baking sheet like a snail shell.
Beat the remaining egg yolk in a small bowl and paint the surface of the
dough with it. Sprinkle it with sugar and bake 35 to 40 minutes, or until
pastry is firm and golden brown.
