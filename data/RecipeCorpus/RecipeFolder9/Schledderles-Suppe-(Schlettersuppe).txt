Title: Schledderles-Suppe (Schlettersuppe)
Categories: Soups/stews, German
Yield: 4 servings
Broth
Salt
Nutmeg
Pepper
Greens
2 tb Flour
1    Egg
Salt to taste
1 tb Water
Soup:
Similar to 'Einlaufsuppe' ('Pour-In Soup').

Combine the first four ingredients in a a small beaker-like pot and stir
until smooth.  (The batter should drip in a long thin thread off the
spoon).  Tilt the pot and scrape the batter off the edge into the boiling
broth.  This results in the elongated 'Schletterle' which are sort of
halfway between spaetzle and noodles.

Bring to a second boil, and adjust seasoning (salt, nutmeg, pepper, and
greens).  Serve.

Serves 4.
