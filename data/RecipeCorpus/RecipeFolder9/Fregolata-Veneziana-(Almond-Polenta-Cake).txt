-(or blanched almonds)
1/4 c  Skinned, toasted hazelnuts

the remaining granulated sugar and process to a very fine powder.

Transfer the almond powder to the bowl of a mixer or a large mixing bowl
and beat in the butter until blended.  Add the egg yolks, lemon juice,
lemon zest, and the vanilla and almond extracts; mix until well blended.
Add the cornmeal, flour, and salt to the almond mixture and stir just until

preferably with a removable bottom.  Spread the dough in the pan, using
your fingers to distribute dough to the edge.  Sprinkle with the chopped
nuts and brown sugar.

Bake for 5 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 300 F and bake for 45 to 50 minutes
longer, until the surface is a pale golden brown.  Cool completely on a
rack and cut into wedges to serve.

Yield:  Ten to twelve wedges.
