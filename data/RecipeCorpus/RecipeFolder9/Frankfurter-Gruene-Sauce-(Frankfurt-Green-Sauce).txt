Title: Frankfurter Gruene Sauce (Frankfurt Green Sauce)
Categories: Sauces, German, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 2 servings
2 tb Mayonnaise
3/4 c  Low-fat cottage cheese
-(pressed through a fine
-sieve
In order to smooth curds)
Ground white pepper
Small pinch of sugar
1    To 2 eggs, hardboiled and
-coarsely chopped
3 c  Mixed herbs (parsley,
-chives, chervil, borage,
-dill,
Spinach greens, watercress,
-tarragon, basil,
Pimpernel)
1 c  Sour cream or plain yogurt
2 sm Onions. coarsely chopped
2 tb Cream
Choose all or merely a selection of the herbs and greens mentioned in the
list of ingredients (using the tarragon more sparingly than the others.)
Wash them thoroughly and drain on paper towels. Coarsely chop the greens;
loosely packed, they should amount to about 3 cups altogether. Take 2 cups
of the greens, combine with the sour cream or yogurt and the onions, and
puree in the blender or processor; add a few tablespoons of cream if it
doesn't seem to be fluid enough. The rest of the greens should just be
finely chopped and stirred in a mixing bowl with the puree in order to give
the sauce a little bite. Stir in as much mayonnaise and low-fat cottage
cheese as it takes to produce a smooth, creamy sauce.

Season with salt, pepper, and a very little sugar.  The hardboiled eggs can
either be mixed in with the sauce or strewn over it as a garnish.

Makes 2 - 3 cups.
