"While Schwartz describes the name for this Israeli dish as slightly
pretentious, he notes that it won a cooking competition and found its way
onto the menus of five star hotels. He recommends serving it over a bed or
bulgur pilaf."

In large glass bow, combine chicken parts, orange juice, wine, zest, salt,
paprika and pepper. Let marinate in fridge for 2 hours. Lift chicken out of
marinade; pat dry and reserve chicken & marinate separately. In deep heavy
skillet or shallow pan large enough to hold chicken in one layer; heat oil
over medium-high heat. Brown chicken on all sides; transfer to plate. In
the same pan, cook onion over low heat until it starts to change colour.
Pour in marinade and simmer gently for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Return chicken to pan and simmer, partially covered, basting the chicken
with pan juices and turning the pieces over very low heat for about 35
minutes; or until chicken juices run clear when flesh is pierced with a
sharp knife. Transfer chicken to warm serving platter and keep warm. Skim
off excess fat. Add olives to pan and boil rapidly over high heat until
glossy and starting to thicken. Pour over chicken and sprinkle with meat.
SERVES: 4-6
