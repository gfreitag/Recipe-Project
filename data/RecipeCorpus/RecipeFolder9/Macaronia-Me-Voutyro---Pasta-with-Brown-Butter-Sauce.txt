Title: Macaronia Me Voutyro - Pasta with Brown Butter Sauce
Categories: Greek, Pasta, Sauces
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Kefalotyri or Parmesan
-(Grated)
Karen Mintzias
1 lb Spaghetti or other pasta
1/2 lb Butter
Fill a large deep pot 3/4 full with water.  Add salt and bring to a rolling
boil.  Add pasta slowly, without breaking the boil.  Cook 10 minutes. Place
a colander in sink and turn pasta into it.  Rinse under hot running water,
allowing the water to drain through the spaghetti.

Heat the butter in a small saucepan to a honey brown.  Watch it carefully
for these minutes; it burns quickly and suddenly.  Return spaghetti to
large pot and dribble hot butter over it.  Sprinkle with half the cheese
and toss gently to mix.

Transfer to a large ovenproof platter, sprinkle top with more cheese and
bake for 10 minutes at 350 F.  Serve hot.
