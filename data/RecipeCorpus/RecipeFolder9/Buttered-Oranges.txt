"A recipe for Buttered Oranges can be found in Ann Blendcowe's cookery book
published in 1694; they are also sometimes referred to as Nell Gwynn's
Buttered Oranges, as she was believed to have served them to Charles II.
Buttered Oranges are delicious, and they look spectacular."

To prepare the Orange Shells: Hold the orange so the stalk (or navel) is at
the base and using a small knife cut off the top about two inches down.
Scoop out all the flesh, being carefully not to break the skin. This can be
done quite easily with a teaspoon. Using a pair of scissors, cut off the
stalk that remains in the bottom, wash the orange and set it aside (the top
can be discarded). Repeat this procedure with three more of the oranges.
Grate the peel off the remaining orange and then squeeze the juice from
this orange into the bowl. Place the flesh you have extracted from the
other oranges in the sieve and squeeze the juice in the same bowl. Mix the
juice with the sugar and egg yolks in a double boiler over low heat. Beat
with a wire whisk until the mixture begins to thicken. Remove the top of
the double boiler and cool in a bowl of cold water while you continue to
stir; then add the sherry and rosewater. Remove the bowl from the cold
water. Cut the butter into 1-inch cubes and mash it into the mixture piece
by piece. Add the orange peel. Whip 3/4 of the cream and fold it into the
mixture. Pour the mixture into the four orange shells and refrigerate for
at least 2 hours. Before serving, place three crystallized violets on the
top of each orange; whip the remaining cream and force it through a pastry
tube in a curly pattern around the top edges. SERVES:4
