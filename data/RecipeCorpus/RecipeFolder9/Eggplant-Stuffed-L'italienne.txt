Title: Eggplant Stuffed L'italienne
Categories: Vegetables, Italian
Yield: 1 servings
6    Anchovy filets
-finely chopped
2 tb Capers; minced
Parsley and basil (optional)
1/2 c  Olives, finely minced
5    Eggplants, very small or
1/2 c  Olive oil
1    Tomatoes, peeled, seeded
-and chopped
1 1/2 c  Bread crumbs, home made
-or preprepared
1    Tuna fish, canned;-optional
l lg -Eggplant

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 2. Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise, if
using the small ones and take out the flesh, being careful not to damage
the skin.  Mince the pulp well and place in colander after sprinkling with
coarse(sea or kosher) salt for 30 minutes. Do the same with the eggplant
shells and put them on a paper towel to drain. 3. Heat 4 tablespoons of
olive oil in a large skillet. Add the well drained eggplant pulp and cook
until lightly browned. 4. Add the tomatoes and cook the mixture over high
heat until the liquid is evaporated. 5. Add the other ingredients (Note:I
do not use the tuna fish or the olives if I'm making this as a side
dish;but they would be necessary if this is to be a main dish entree.) Cook
the mixture for 2 more minutes. Season with care as the anchovies and
capers are quite strongly flavored. 6. Fill the eggplant halves with the
mixture.  there will probably be leftover ingredients to be placed in a
baking dish. Drizzle the leftover olive oil on top and bake for 1 hour.
