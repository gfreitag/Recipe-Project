Title: Fettucine Alfredo
Categories: Pasta, Italian
Yield: 6 servings
-cheese,
1    Pinch of nutmeg,
1    Pinch of fresh parsley
-(optional),
1    Little pepper (optional).
1/2 c  Unsalted (sweet) butter,
1 lb Fresh Fettucine noodles
1/2 c  Light cream (or diluted
-Creme Fraiche),
1 c  Freshly grated parmesan
Put water on to boil for the noodles.  As the water comes to  a boil, start
preparing  the sauce.  In  a  separate  pan  melt unsalted (sweet) butter
over very low heat - DO  NOT  LET  IT BROWN!!

Once  the butter has melted, stir into the butter: light  cream (or the
diluted Creme Fraiche), freshly grated parmesan cheese. Beat this with a
whisk to keep the sauce from clumping.   Once the sauce is smooth, season
the sauce with a pinch of nutmeg, a pinch of fresh parsley (optional), and
a  little   pepper (optional).

Turn the sauce down to a simmer and add fresh Fettucine noodles (or a batch
of homemade noodles) to the boiling  water.   When the noodles are cooked
al dente, drain and toss  gently  with sauce. Serve immediately.

The order of these steps is important, as it is better to  make the sauce
wait for the noodles than to make the  noodles  wait for the sauce.
