Title: Escudella De Pages (Country Stew)
Categories: Soups/stews, Spanish, Pork/ham, Veal
Yield: 6 servings
-pieces
1/2 lb Veal, bite-sized pieces
1/2 lb Potatoes
1 md Leek
5 oz Carrots
4 oz Green cabbage
4 oz Dried Great Northern, cooked
4 oz Rice
3 oz Pasta, medium or large
2 1/2 qt Water
4    Veal bones
1    Ham bone
Salt
1    Generous pinch of saffron
-threads
3 tb Olive oil
4 oz Salt pork
4 oz Peeled, chopped onions
1/2    Stewing chicken, bite-sized
(NOTE:  Oz measurements are by weight.) Make a good broth with the water,
veal and ham bones, simmering slowly. When nearly done, add salt to taste
and the saffron. Blanch the salt pork to remove the excess salt, then dice.
Heat the oil in a large skillet, add the diced salt pork and chopped
onions. When the onions begin to brown, add the pieces of chicken and veal
and allow to cook slowly. Peel the potatoes, leek and carrots, chop them
fairly finely, then add to the skillet with the chicken and veal. Chop the
cabbage finely and add to the skillet. Give it all a good stir. Remove the
bones from the broth and discard.  Empty the contents of the skillet into
the broth, then add the beans, rice and pasta. Cook for about 10 - 15
minutes, until the rice and pasta are done, then serve very hot.

Pages, in Catalan, means peasant, rural, or rustic.
