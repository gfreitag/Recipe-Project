1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 lb White cabbage; cored, and
Thinly sliced
2 tb Butter
1/2 c  Hot water
Directions: Directions: Lightly salt the chops, preferably an hour before
you plan to cook them. Oil a heavy casserole that can be placed on top of
the stove and that is just wide enough to hold two chops.

Put in two chops and sprinkle them with flour.  Place a 1/2 to 1-inch layer
of cabbage over them, sprinkle with salt and then flour, and dot with
butter. Continue making layers, ending with cabbage and a little butter.
Pour on the hot water.

Tie the peppercorns securely in cheesecloth and lightly bruise them with a
rolling pin, or bruise them with pestle and mortar and put them in a metal
spice-holding ball.  Bury the peppercorns in the casserole.

Cover and bring to the boil.  Immediately lower the heat and simmer very
gently for about 1 1/2 hours, until the meat is very tender and the cabbage
almost melted.  Remove the peppercorns.  Serve with boiled potatoes.
