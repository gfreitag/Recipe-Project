Title: Linguine Alle Vongole
Categories: Italian, Pasta, Fish/sea
Yield: 4 servings
1    Sm Onion; finely chopped
3 c  Garlic; minced or pressed
1/2 c  Dry white wine
Salt and pepper
1/2 c  Parsley; chopped fresh
3    Hard-shell clams; small  in
1/2 lb Linguine or spaghetti
Salted water
2 tb Butter or margarine
2 tb Olive oil
Place clams and 1/4 cup water in a large heavy pan. Cover and simmer just
until clams pop open (5 to 10 minutes). When cool enough to handle, remove
clams from shells and set aside (save a few clams in shells for garnish, if
you wish). Strain clam broth through a piece of dampened muslin to remove
grit; reserve broth. Cook linguine in a large kettle of boiling salted
water according to package directions until al dente; drain well. While
linguine cooks, place butter and oil in a wide frying pan over medium heat.
When butter is melted, add onion and cook, stirring often, until soft. Mix
in garlic, wine, and strained clam broth. Bring to a boil, stirring
occasionally, and cook until liquid is reduced by about half. Add clams,
season with salt and pepper to taste, and stir in parsley. Arrange linguine
on a warm serving platter. Spoon hot sauce over linguine. Garnish with
reserved clams in shells, if you wish.
