Categories: Penndutch, Meats
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 tb Flour
Salt & Pepper
1    Rabbit
1    Potato Filling Recipe
1/2 c  Broth **
** "Use broth in which rabbit is cooked". The recipe didn't specify, but I
assume that the rabbit is to be boiled.
~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cook the rabbit until tender, separate meat from the bones and cut into
small pieces. Butter a casserole and put a layer of the potato filling in
the bottom, then a layer of meat; add 1 Tbsp of sauce (made by combining
the flour and water), seasoning, and continue until dish is filled. Bake at
350Ã¸F until brown (about 25 minutes). Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book
