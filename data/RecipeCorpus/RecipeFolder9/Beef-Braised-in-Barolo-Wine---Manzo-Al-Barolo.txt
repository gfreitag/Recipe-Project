produced.

bowl.  Add bay leaves, thyme and enough wine to cover meat. Cover and
refrigerate overnight.  Drain meat, reserving marinade. Dry meat with paper
towels.  Melt 2 tablespoons butter with oil in a large heavy casserole.
When butter foams, add meat. brown meat on all sides over medium heat.
Remove meat from casserole.  Add onion, carrot and celery to casserole.
Saute until lightly browned.  Return meat to casserole. Pour reserved
marinade through a strainer over meat. Cover casserole and reduce heat.
Simmer 2 to 2-1/2 hours or until meat is tender. Turn and baste meat often
during cooking.

Wash and dry mushrooms thoroughly and slice thin.  Melt 1 tablespoon butter
in a medium skillet.  Saute mushrooms over high heat until golden. Add
mushrooms to meat and cook 5 minutes longer.  Place meat on a cutting board
and cool 5 minutes.  If sauce is too thin, cook uncovered over high heat 5
to 10 minutes.  Slice meat and arrange on a warm platter. Taste and adjust
sauce for seasoning, then spoon over meat. Serve immediately.

Makes 6 to 8 servings.
