Title: Gelo Di Mellone
Categories: Desserts, Italian
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 oz Semisweet chocolate
- coarsely grated
3 tb Candied citron
- rinsed and chopped
Cinnamon; for finishing
1/4    Ripe watermelon
2/3 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Cornstarch
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 tb Chopped, blanched pistachios
Popular in Palermo, this dessert carries the humble watermelon to new
heights of sophistication.

SPOON THE FLESH AWAY from the rind of the melon into a large bowl. Remove
seeds and liquefy in food processor or blender. Combine sugar and
cornstarch in a 3-quart non-reactive saucepan and add watermelon juice
gradually, whisking it in. Place over low heat and bring to a boil,
stirring constantly with a flat-edged wooden spatula. At the boil, continue
cooking about 5 minutes, stirring constantly, over lowest heat. Remove from
heat, stir in vanilla extract and pour into a mixing bowl. Cool to room
temperature, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin from forming on the
surface. After the gelo has cooled, stir in the remaining ingredients,
except the cinnamon. Pour into a glass serving bowl and chill. To serve the
gelo, spoon into dessert bowls and sprinkle with cinnamon at the table.
