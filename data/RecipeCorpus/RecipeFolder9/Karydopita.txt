Karen Mintzias
3 c  Water
4 c  Granulated sugar
1    Orange or lemon; peel only
2    Whole cloves
18    Eggs; separated
Combine the water, 2 1/2 cups of the sugar, orange or lemon peel, and
cloves in a saucepan and boil for 10 minutes.  Remove the peel and cloves
and cool.  Meanwhile, using an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks until
light and lemon colored, and gradually add the remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar.
In a separate bowl, mix the Cognac, vanilla extract, and baking soda and
slowly add to the yolks and sugar.  Combine zwieback, walnuts, and
cinnamon, and gradually add to the batter, mixing on low speed. Meanwhile,
beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Slowly fold into the cake
batter, then pour into a greased 15 1/2" x 11" x 2" baking pan. Bake in a
350 degree oven for 30 minutes, or until a deep chestnut color. Remove from
the oven and set on a wire rack.  Spoon the cooled syrup over the cake and
allow it to cool in the pan.  Cut into traditional diamond shapes,
according to desired size.
