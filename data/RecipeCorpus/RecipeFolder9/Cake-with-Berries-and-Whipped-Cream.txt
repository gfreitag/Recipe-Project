Title: Cake with Berries and Whipped Cream
Categories: Cakes, German
Yield: 6 servings
250 g  Flour (2 cups plus 3 1/2
-Tbsp)
6 g  Baking powder (1 3/4 tsp)
3 tb Milk
150 g  Butter or margarine (2/3
-cup)
150 g  Sugar (2/3 cup)
Peel of 1 lemon
3    Eggs
Also for 'versoffenen Apfelkuchen' (drunk apple tart).  Cut in half
horizontally.  Spread vanilla pudding on top, then scatter strawberries or
raspberries, (?*) on top of that, then whipped cream.  Top with more
strawberries.

((*Note:  I absolutely cannot make any sense of that word.  It looks like
'Narinken' or 'Merinken' - neither of which means anything to me. At a
guess, some other sort of berries, or possibly morellos. K.B.))
