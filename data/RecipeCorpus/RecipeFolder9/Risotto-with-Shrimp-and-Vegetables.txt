Soak dried mushrooms in hot water until soft, at least 1/2 hour. Remove
mushrooms with slotted spoon and strain liquid through cheesecloth into
medium saucepan.  Add chicken broth, water,and wine; bring to a boil. Keep
hot over low heat, covered.  Rinse mushrooms in water to remove all grit;
chop into 1/2-inch pieces.  Remove stem ends and seeds from tomatoes; chop
into 1/2-inch cubes.  Cut flowerets from broccoli. Peel tough skin from
stems with vegetable peeler; cut stems into 1/4-inch slices. Heat oil in
5-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add broccoli and saute until
tender-crisp.  Transfer to bowl; cover, and keep warm. Add 2 tablespoons
butter to Dutch oven; saute onion and garlic for 1 minute. Add rice; cook
over medium heat, stirring, for 2 minutes. Laddle simmering broth, 1/2 cup
at a time, into rice mixture, while stirring. Alloe rice to absorb broth
before adding more.  After 10 minutes, add mushrooms, and continue to cook,
stirring, until rice is tender but firm, about 10 to 15 minutes longer.
Rice should be creamy. Remove rice from heat; cover and keep warm. Melt
remaining butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Add shrimp; cook,
stirring constantly, until shrimp are just pink, about 3 minutes. Remove
from heat.  Stir tomatoes and broccoli into cooked rice. Add shrimp and pan
liquid to rice and vegetable mixture; mix well. Cook over medium-high heat
until heated through; remove from heat. Stir in basil, if desired. Serve
immediately in warmed shallow soup bowls or deep plates.
