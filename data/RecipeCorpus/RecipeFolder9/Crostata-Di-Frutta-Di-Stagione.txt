SIFT TOGETHER FLOUR, sugar and salt on a wooden pastry board. Make a well
in the center and add butter, egg yolks and lemon rind. Mix and knead with
the fingertips taking care not to handle too much. When smooth, shape into
a ball and chill for about 30 minutes. Roll out lightly in a circle, cut
edges and keep dough about 1 inch larger than a 8- to 9-inch (diameter)
fluted flan tin. Butter and flour the pan and fit the pastry into it, again
trim the edges, prick with fork and flute edges. Place in preheated oven at
moderate heat for 15 to 20 minutes.

CREAM PASTICCERA: Beat together yolks and sugar until slightly thickened
and a light lemon color. Beat in flour and vanilla. Over medium heat, bring
milk just to the boil. Let it cool for a moment, then add it to the egg
mixture, whisking rapidly. Cook over low heat until the pastry cream
thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Cool. When cream
pasticcera is cool, spread evenly on the bottom of the pie. Fill with
whatever fresh fruits are available, glaze with an apricot jam. Melt
apricot jam glaze with a little hot water.
