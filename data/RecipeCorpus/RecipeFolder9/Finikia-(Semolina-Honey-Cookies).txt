Makes: 60 Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F) Cooking time: 25 minutes

Cream butter, sugar and orange rind until light and fluffy. Gradually add
oil and continue to beat on high speed until mixture thickens to whipped
cream consistency.  Sift flour and baking powder twice and combine with
semolina and spices.  Gradually add to creamed mixture alternately with
orange juice.  When combined knead with hand to form a firm dough.

Shape tablespoonfuls of dough into ovals, place on ungreased baking sheets
and pinch ends to form torpedo shape.  Bake in a moderate oven for 25
minutes until golden brown and crisp.  Cool on baking sheets.

In a pan stir water and sugar over heat until sugar dissolves.  Add honey,
cinnamon bark and lemon juice and bring to the boil.  Boil over medium heat
for 10 minutes and remove cinnamon.

While syrup is boiling, dip cookies in 3 at a time, turn over in syrup,
then remove to a rack placed over a dish. Repeat with number required for
serving.  Store remainder in a sealed container for later dipping.

Sprinkle dipped cookies with sesame seeds or chopped walnuts and serve.
