1/4 c  All purpose flour

1 ts Worcestershire sauce

1 ts Lemon juice
1 sm Can of peas, drained
1    Egg yolk

Cut chicken into pieces. Place chicken in a deep saucepan; cover with cold
water. Add salt, leek, celery, carrot, whole clove, bay leaf and onion.
Bring to boil; reduce heat. Simmer 1 to 2 hours, depending on size and
tenderness of chicken. When joints linking thigh portions to main body move
easily and seem flexable, chicken will be done. Remove chicken from cooking
liquid; cool slightly. Remove skin and fat; cut flesh from bones in large
pieces. Strain liquid. Cut mushrooms into thin slices. Sautee in a small
amount of butter in a medium skillet. Melt butter in a large skillet. Stir
in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, until light golden brown, about 3
minutes. Add a small amount of hot cooking liquid and season with salt,
nutmeg, Worcestershire sauce, wine and lemon juice. Place chicken pieces,
sauteed mushrooms and peas in sauce; warm gently over low heat. When all
ingredients are hot, turn off heat. Let stand 3 to 4 minutes. Before
serving, blend egg yolk and whipping cream in a small bowl. Stir egg yolk
mixture into sauce to make it smooth and rich. Serve hot with rice.
