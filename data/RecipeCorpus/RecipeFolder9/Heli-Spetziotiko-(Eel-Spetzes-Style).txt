2 tb Olive oil
2 lb Eel; (moray, conger, OR

1/2 lb Onions; roughly chopped

2 tb Boiling water; -OR-
1 tb -Tomato paste instead
3/4 lb Tomatoes
-- skinned, seeded & chopped
1/2 ts Honey
In a heavy skillet or wide flameproof casserole, heat 2 tablespoons olive
oil and saute the eel pieces until well browned on all sides.  Remove from
the pan and add another tablespoon oil if necessary.

Add the onions and fry gently until translucent.  Pound the sun-dried
tomatoes, if using, to a paste.  Add to the pan with the chopped tomatoes,
honey, thyme, bay leaf, lemon zest, and garlic and simmer for 10-12 minutes
until the sauce begins to thicken.

Return the eel pieces to the sauce and stir in the parsley, mint, and salt
and pepper to taste.  Move to a baking dish or earthenware casserole, if
necessary.  Strew with the crumbled feta and shake the dish, so the cheese
settles a little.  Sprinkle with lemon juice.  Bake in an oven preheated to
350 degrees F for about 30 minutes.
