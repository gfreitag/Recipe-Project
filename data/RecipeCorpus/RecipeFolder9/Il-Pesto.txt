Categories: Sauces, Italian
Yield: 6 servings
2    Garlic cloves
1/4 c  Black walnuts
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper; black
3/4 c  Olive oil
1/4 lb Pig's liver
2 tb Butter
1 ts Chives; chopped
1/2 c  Cheese, sharp white;
-grated
2 c  Basil, fresh
Saut the liver in the butter; when cool, remove from pan & chop coarsely.
In a blender or food processor combine the basil, garlic, walnuts, chives,
cheese, salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup of the olive oil.  Blend at low speed
until a pure consistency is achieved.  Slowly add the remaining oil,
blending at low speed  until the oil is completely incorporated and the

Serve as a spread for crackers or as a sauce for spaghetti; if the latter,
increase the oil to 1-1/2 cups.
