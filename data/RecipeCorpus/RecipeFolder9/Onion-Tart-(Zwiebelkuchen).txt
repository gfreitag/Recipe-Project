Preheat oven to 400F (250C). Lightly grease an 11 inch quiche pan; set
aside. Using a pastry blender or fork, work butter into flour. Stir in 1
egg, half and half and salt to make dough. Let stand in a cool place for a
few minutes. Thinly slice onions. Fry bacon in a small skillet over medium
heat until golden brown. Add onion rings; saute 2 to 3 minutes. Drain off
excess fat. In a medium bowl, beat together whipping cream, 2 eggs, salt
and pepper. On a lightly floured surface roll out pastry. Line greased pan
with pastry. Prick pastry surface with a fork. Spread cooked bacon and
onions over pastry. Pour in cream mixture. Cover with foil. Bake 20 mins.
Remove foil; bake 10 to 15 mins longer or until set. Cut in squares or
wedges. Serve warm. When cooking for large numbers, double the quantites
given. Bake on a large baking sheet or jelly-roll pan. Puff pastry or pizza
dough can be substituted for pie pastry. If serving this tart for dinner or
supper, a chilled white German wine will make the perfect match.
