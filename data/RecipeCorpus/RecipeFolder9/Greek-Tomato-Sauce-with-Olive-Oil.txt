Karen Mintzias
2 tb Olive oil
1 sm Onion; chopped
2    Garlic cloves; minced
2 lb Fresh tomatoes*
1 ts Granulated sugar
*Note: Tomatoes should be peeled and chopped if fresh, or you may
substitute 1 two-and-one-half pound can plum tomatoes, chopped.

Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan, stir in the onions, and cook gently until
transparent.  Add the garlic, tomatoes, sugar, wine, salt and pepper, and
cinnamon, if desired.  Taste for seasoning, then allow the sauce to simmer
gently for 30 minutes.  Remove the cinnamon stick before serving hot.

NOTE:  For a thicker sauce, add 1/4 cup tomato paste diluted with 1/4 cup
water when adding the tomatoes.  For a smoother consistency, the sauce may
be strained and seeds discarded just before the parsley and basil are
added.
