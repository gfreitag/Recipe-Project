Categories: Pork/ham, Sausages, Hungarian
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Salt
1/2 tb Black pepper, freshly
-ground
3 tb Hungarian paprika
1 ts Saltpeter
1/4 ts Cloves, ground
1    Sausage casing, 1" diameter
-- 10 feet
3 lb Pork butt, boneless - cut

1 lb Beef chuck, cut into large
-pieces
1 lb Pork fat, fresh - cut into
-large pieces
10    Garlic cloves, peeled and
-crushed (about 2 tbs)
1 c  Water
In a meat grinder, coarsely grind the pork, beef, and pork fat, in
batches. Add all remaining ingredients, except the casings. Mix well and
allow to sit while you clean the casings.
Rinse the casings thoroughly in cold water and run fresh water through
them. Drain.
Using a sausage machine, a KitchenAid with a sausage attatchment, or a
sausage funnel, fill the casings and tie them off into about 16" lengths.
Do not fill them too tightly as they must have room to expand when they
cook.
Hang the sausages in a home style smoker and smoke them for abour 1
hour. Do not allow the temperature of the smoker to go above 150 F.
Remove the sausages and hang over a stick or dowel. Put the stick in a
cool place and position an electric fan so that it will blow directly on
the sausages. Allow them to dry for 2 days. They are they ready for use.
Place them in the refrigerator, where they will keep well for about a
week.
