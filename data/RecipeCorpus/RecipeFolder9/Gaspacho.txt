Title: Gaspacho
Categories: Soups/stews, Spanish
Yield: 4 servings
4 oz Olive oil
Juice of one lemon
1    Onion, mild; slice paperthin
1 c  Cucumber; diced
Salt
Pepper
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
1 tb Chives, fresh
1 tb Chervil, fresh
1 tb Parsley, fresh
1 tb Basil, fresh
1 tb Marjoram, fresh
1    Garlic clove
1    Pepper, bell
2    Tomato; peeled & seeded
Chop the herbs and mash thoroughly with the garlic, pepper, and tomatoes,
adding the oil very slowly, and the lemon juice.  Add about three glasses
of cold water [I still say this is the *correct* liquid.  But often I use
good meat or fish stock.] or as much as you wish.  Put in the onion and the
cucumber, season, sprinkle with bread crumbs, and ice for at least four
hours before serving.
