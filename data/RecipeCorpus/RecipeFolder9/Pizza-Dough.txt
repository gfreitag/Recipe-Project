Title: Pizza Dough
Categories: Breads, Italian, Pizza
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 c  Warm water (125F)
1/2 ts Salt
3 c  Unbleached white flour
1 oz Fresh yeast; -=OR=-
2 pk - Instant dry yeast granules
1/2 c  Milk; at room temperature
IN A LARGE BOWL, dissolve the yeast in a mixture of the milk and water. Mix
in the flour and salt to make a soft dough. Knead 10 minutes by hand, or 4
minutes in a heavy-duty mixer with a dough hook. Oil a clean bowl and set
the dough in it, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise until
doubled in bulk. (In the traditional warm place, this will take about 2
hours. However, a cooler temperature will do as long as the dough has
enough time to rise, including overnight in the refrigerator.) If the dough
is ready sooner than it is needed, punch it down and refrigerate it or let
it rise slowly again at room temperature until ready to use. When ready to
use, divide into 4 equal parts. Roll 1 into an 8-inch round. Top with
favorite toppings and bake 10 minutes in 450F oven.

Makes 4 Pizzas
