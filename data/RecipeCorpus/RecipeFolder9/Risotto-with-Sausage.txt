Title: Risotto with Sausage
Categories: Italian, Sausages
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Butter
2 tb Dry white wine
1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
3/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
3    Links parsley/cheese sausage
-=OR=-
1/2 lb - Luganega sausage,
- (commercially made)
1 qt Meat broth
1/3 c  Finely chopped onion
REMOVE THE CASINGS from the sausage and break up the sausage. Bring the
broth to a simmer. In a casserole, soften the chopped onion in half the
butter. Add the sausage meat and brown it. Raise heat, sprinkle on the
wine, and let it evaporate. Add the rice, stirring to coat all the grains
with the fat. Saute 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and start
adding broth, a ladleful at a time. Stir often and add more broth only as
the rice begins to dry out. Cook for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the rice is
al dente and has absorbed almost all its liquid. (If you run out of broth
before then, use boiling water.) Stir in the remaining butter and all the
grated cheese. Taste for salt and pepper. Serve at once.
