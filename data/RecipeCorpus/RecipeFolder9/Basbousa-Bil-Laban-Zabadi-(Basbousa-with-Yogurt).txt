Categories: Desserts, Ethnic
Yield: 20 servings
3/4 c  Sugar
1 c  Semolina
1 ts Baking powder
Few drops vanilla extract
Whipped cream
1 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Water
1/2    Lemon (juice only)
1/2 lb Unsalted butter
1/3 c  Blanched almonds
1/2 c  Yogurt
Make a thick syrup by boiling the sugar, water and lemon juice together and
simmering until it thickens. Allow to cool and chill. Melt half of the
unsalted butter. Toast the blanched almonds and chop them finely. Beat the
yogurt with the sugar in a large mixing bowl. Add melted butter and all
remaining ingredients except the cream, and beat well until thoroughly
mixed. Pour into a large rectangular buttered baking tray and bake in a 400
degree oven for 30 min. Pour the cold syrup immediately over the hot
basbousa as soon as it comes out of the oven. Cut into lozenge shapes and
return to the oven for 3 more minutes. Serve soused with other half of
butter, melted, and spread with whipped cream.
