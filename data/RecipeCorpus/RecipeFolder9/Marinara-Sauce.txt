One of the virtues of a marinara sauce is that it is so quick and easy to
prepare, and light.  Saute' in the oil the onions, carrots, and garlic
until onions are soft.  Mill in the black pepper, and add the tomatoes.
Stir the sauce well, add the salt, and cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Now
push the sauce through a food mill.  It will emerge velvety. Melt butter in
a pan and add the strained sauce.  Stirring often, cook for 15 minutes. For
extra personality, at this stage you can stir in the hot red pepper. Makes
7 cups.
