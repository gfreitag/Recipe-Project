Categories: Pasta, Italian
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Rosemary, fresh; chopped
2 tb Basil, fresh; chopped
1 ts Tomato paste
1/2 ts Red pepper flakes
Salt; to taste
1 lb Fusilli
Parmesan
Parsley; chopped

Peel and crumble sausage.  Cook in a deep saucepan until it has changed
color.  If using a lean sausage, you may need to add a tablespoon of olive
oil to the pan.  Add the onions and garlic and sautÂ‚ until the onions are
transparent.  Add the wine and let simmer (not quite boiling) for a couple
of minutes.  Then add the tomatoes, bring to a boil, lower the heat, and
add all herbs (except the parsley), tomato paste, pepper flakes, and canned
beans, and let simmer while the pasta is cooking.

Cook the pasta al dente, drain, and stir into the bean mixture.  Toss in
the parsley and stir again.  Add the Parmesan very gradually, and stir
more.  Serve immediately.
