Title: Schneiderflecklesuppe
Categories: Soups/stews, Pasta, German
Yield: 4 servings
Meat broth
Ground nutmeg
Chives
1    Egg
1 tb Water
Salt
200 g  Flour (1 3/4 cups)
On a pastry board, combine the flour, egg, water and salt into a pasta
dough, then roll it out paper thin.  Hang the dough over the back of a
chair or something similar for drying.  After the dough has been drying for
1 1/2 to 2 hours, cut it into 2/3-inch squares.  As you spread out the
dough on the board, you will have to keep dusting it with flour.  Bring
some lightly salted water to a boil and cook the 'Fleckle' for about 10 to
15 minutes. Drain, briefly rinse in cold water, and then add to the hot
meat broth.  Adjust soup's seasoning, and top with chopped chives.

Variation:  RIEBELESUPPE

Prepare a dough as for the 'Schneiderflecklesuppe', but make it a bit
firmer so you will be able to grate it onto the board. Cook 'Riebele' for a
few minutes in salted water, then strain and add to hot meat broth.

Serves 4.
