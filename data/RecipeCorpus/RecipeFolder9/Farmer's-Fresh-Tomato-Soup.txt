Heat the oil, onions, garlic and celery in a soup pot over medium- low
heat, stirring occasionally, until golden (about 20 minutes).  Add the
tomatoes and salt; cook, partially covered, until the tomatoes are
softened, about 20 minutes.  If necessary, add a pinch of sugar to balance
the acidity of the tomatoes.

Put the bread in a small bowl and add 1 cup of hot broth to soften. Mash
the bread well with a wooden spoon.  Add the softened bread and remaining
broth to the tomatoes, stirring well to completely dissolve the bread.
Simmer for about 30 minutes.  Add the herbs during the last 5 minutes of
cooking.  Pass the soup through the fine blade of a food mill or puree in a
food processor and strain.

Put the soup back in the soup pot and correct the seasoning.  Simmer for 10
minutes.  Ladle into heated soup bowls and pour 1 teaspoon of olive oil
over each serving.  Garnish with sprigs of fresh marjoram.

Serves 6 to 8.
