Yield: 6 servings
1    Egg
1 ts Double-acting baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
6 oz Uncooked millet
1 1/2 c  Club soda (at room
-temperature)
In blender container process millet in small batches until it resembles
fine flour; remove to bowl and set aside.

In blender container combine club soda, egg, baking powder, and baking soda
and, using an on-off motion, process until combined. Add ground millet and
process at high speed into a smooth batter, about 1 minute.

Pour into 4-cup measure, cover, and let stand at room temperature until
fermented and foamy, about 1 1/2 hours.

Spray 10-inch nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray and heat.

Stir batter; pour 1/6 of batter (about scant 1/3 cup) into skillet and
quickly swirl batter so that it covers entire bottom of pan. Cover skillet
with tight-fitting lid and cook over high heat until bread is spongy and
moist (it will have air holes), about 1 minute (do not brown bottom as
edges will become crisp and bread will crack when folded); transfer to
plate and let cool. Repeat procedure 5 more times, making 5 more breads.

To serve, fold each bread into quarters.

Makes 6 servings, 1 bread each.

Here is what is said in the book:

" This is the national bread of Ethiopia and is served with almost every
meal. It is usually torn into pieces and used to scoop up food. Its faintly
sour but soothing taste cools off the hot spicy dishes it accompanies. "
