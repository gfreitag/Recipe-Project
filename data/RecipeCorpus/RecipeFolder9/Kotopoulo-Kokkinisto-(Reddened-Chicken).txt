Karen Mintzias
1    Frying or roasting chicken*
3 tb Vegetable oil or butter
1    Onion; chopped
2 tb Butter
2 tb All-purpose flour (optional)
1 c  Dry white wine
*Note: Chicken should be about 3 pounds, and cut into serving pieces.

Wash and dry the chicken.  In a frying pan, heat the oil or butter and sear
the chicken over high heat, turning constantly to avoid burning the
chicken.  Remove each piece when reddish in color.  Lower the heat and
saute the onion until soft, adding butter while stirring.  For a thicker
sauce, add the flour and cook 2 minutes, then add the wine and tomatoes.
Simmer until thickened, then strain the sauce into a baking-serving
casserole.  Sprinkle the herbs over the chicken, season lightly with salt
and pepper, and shake the casserole gently.  Chicken should be almost
covered with liquid; if not, add a little water.  Cover tightly and simmer
over low heat or transfer to a medium oven (350 F) to bake for 1 hour, or
until the chicken is tender and the sauce thick.  Serve warm.
