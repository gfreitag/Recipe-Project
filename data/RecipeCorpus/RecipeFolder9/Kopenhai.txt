-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
2    Egg yolks
2 1/2 c  Flour
1 pn Salt
3/4 c  Butter
1/4 c  Sugar
1    Orange (grated rind only)
-------------------------------ALMOND FILLING-------------------------------
1/2 ts Baking powder
2 c  Ground almonds
1 pn Salt
6    Eggs; separated
1/2 c  Caster sugar
1/4 ts Almond essence
1/4 c  Plain flour
------------------------------TO FINISH TORTE------------------------------
1    Thin strip orange rind
1    Thin strip lemon rind
2 ts Lemon juice
2    Pieces cinnamon bark
8    Fillo pastry sheets
1/4 c  Unsalted butter; melted
2 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Water
Cream butter and sugar with grated orange rind until light and fluffy; beat
in egg yolks.  Sift flour and salt into butter mixture to form a soft
dough.

Lightly grease a round 20 cm (12 inch) dish (a "tapsi") or a 25 x 30 cm (10
x 12 inch) baking dish.  As pastry moulds easily any tears can be pressed
together.  An alternative is to put pastry in dish without rolling, and
press it over base and sides with fingers.  Even out by rolling with a
straight-sided glass.

Bake in a moderately hot oven for 15-20 minutes until lightly coloured.
Remove and cool.

To make almond filling, beat egg yolks, sugar and almond essence until
thick and light.  Sift flour with baking powder and combine with ground
almonds.  Fold this lightly into beaten egg yolks. Beat egg whites with
salt until stiff but not dry and fold lightly into almond mixture.  Pour
into pastry-lined dish.

On a flat surface butter a fillo pastry sheet, top with another and butter.
Continue until all sheets are used.  Leave a top sheet unbuttered. Lift
onto top of almond filling and trim edges of fillo in line with pastry
crust, using kitchen scissors.  Brush top with remaining butter. With a
sharp knife or razor blade make slits through the top 2 or 3 sheets running
the length of the dish and spacing them 4 cm (1 1/2 inches) apart.

Bake in a moderate oven for 45 minutes until top is golden and filling is
set.  Meanwhile dissolve sugar in water over medium heat, add fruit rinds,
lemon juice and cinnamon bark and bring to the boil.  Boil for 10 minutes,
strain and cool.  When torte is cooked, cut through slits in pastry down to
the bottom crust.  Pour cooled syrup over hot torte, leave until cool. Cut
diagonally to give diamond-shaped pieces for serving.
