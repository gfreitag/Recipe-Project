Title: Flogheres (Almond Pipes)
Categories: Greek, Cookies
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1    Egg, well-beaten
1 ts Orange peel
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
4 lg Filo pastry sheets
1/2 c  Melted butter
1/2 lb Toasted sliced almonds
1/4 c  Sugar
Cinnamon Honey Syrup (recipe below)

Brush filo sheets with 1/4 cup butter - stacking sheets on a large chopping
board or counter top.  Combine almonds, sugar, salt, egg, orange peel,
cinnamon and remaining butter in a small bowl.  Spread over top of filo
sheets.  Beginning with longer side, roll tightly into one long roll. Tuck
ends in well.  Place in an ungreased, metal baking pan. Slice into 8
portions.  Spread portions out slightly so that heat can circulate between
rolls.  Bake in a moderately hot oven (375 degrees F) 45 to 50 minutes
until top filo is deep golden brown and nuts at side look well-toasted.
Remove from oven and pour hot Cinnamon Honey Syrup over rolls at once until
sizzling stops.  (Do not pour syrup over after sizzling stops or rolls will
be too sticky.)

Cinnamon Honey Syrup: 1 cup honey 1 cup sugar 1 cup water 1 tsp orange peel
1/2 tsp    ground cinnamon 1 Tbsp lemon juice

Combine honey, sugar, water, orange peel, and cinnamon in a small saucepan.
Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture boils.  Simmer 20 minutes. Stir in
lemon juice just before pouring over pastry.

Makes 8 servings.
