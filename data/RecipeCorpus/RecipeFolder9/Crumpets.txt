1 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 c  -Warm water (105 to 115F)

Dissolve yeast in warm water in medium bowl. Stir in remaining ingredients.
Beat until smooth. Cover and let rise in warm place until double, 40 to 60
minutes. Grease griddle or heavy skillet and insides of four to six 3-inch
flan rings or crumpet rings. (See NOTE). Place rings on griddle over medium
heat until hot. Pour about 2 tablespoons batter into each ring. Cook until
tops form bubbles and bottoms are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove
rings and turn crumpets to brown other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with
remaining batter, greasing insides of rings each time. Serve with margarine
or butter and jam or marmalade if desired. NOTE: 6 1/2 ounce tuna, minced
clam or shrimp cans, tops and bottoms removed, can be substituted for the
flan rings.
