Rose Vaggelopoulos of Bridgeport, connecticut, has a large family, all of
whom are great fans of her special turkey stuffing.  "It's very different
and absolutely delicious." says Rose's grand daughter, Diane Connelly. "On
Thanksgiving, I eat just the stuffing."  If pignoli nuts are too expensive,
the cook says, you can substitute walnuts or even pecans.

Brown onions and celery in butter.  Add beef, liver, and sausage and cook
until brown.  Add wine and tomato paste, then herbs, and simmer until meat
