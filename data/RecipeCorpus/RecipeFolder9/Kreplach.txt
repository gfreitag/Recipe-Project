Kreplach

Prepare one recipe noodle dough (see below).  Roll out but don't let dry.
Cut into 3-inch squares and place a tablespoon of one of the following
mixtures on each. Fold over the dough into a triangle. Press edges together
with a little water. Cook in boiling salted water or soup 20 minutes, or
until they rise to the top. They can then be fried or served immediately in
the soup. Makes 24 or more, according to how thin you roll the dough.

HOMEMADE NOODLE DOUGH

Place unsifted flour on a board and make a well in the center.  Drop eggs,
water and salt into it.  Work the four with one hand and knead until smooth
and elastic.  Roll and stretch the dough as thin as possible. The thinner
it is, the better the noodles. ***STOP HERE FOR KREPLACH RECIPE*** Let the
rolled dough stand until it feels dry to the tough, but don't let it get
too dry.  you can cut the dough into squares, strips or very narrow
noodles.  For narrow ones roll up like jelly roll and slice as thin as
possible.  Shake until they separate, and let dry very thoroughly.  Cook
the amount you want in boiling salted water or soup for about 10 minutes.
Keep the balance in tightly closed jars.
