Karen Mintzias
1/2 lb Butter
1/2 c  Sugar or honey
1    Egg; separated
Note:  Walnuts, almonds or pistachios may be used in this recipe. Apricot,
quince, raspberry or rose preserves are suggested.

Beat butter until fluffy.  Add sugar or honey, and beat in.  Add the yolk
of an egg.  Sift flour with confectioners' sugar and add.  In a separate
bowl beat egg white with a fork slightly.

Spoon out a small amount of dough and roll into a ball.  (If dough is too
soft, refrigerate 1 hour.  Do not add more flour.)  Dip in egg white and
then roll in chopped nuts or sesame seeds.  Place on greased cookie sheet.
Poke a hole in the middle for preserves, or press slightly to flatten.

Bake in a preheated oven at 400 F for 12 minutes.  While still warm, fill
holes with preserves or jam.
