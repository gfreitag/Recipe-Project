Title: Lacy Potato Pancakes (Latkes)
Categories: Pancakes, Jewish, Breakfast
Yield: 2 servings
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1 pn Lemon pepper
4    Potatoes - peeled
1 sm Onion
2    Eggs
1/3 c  Flour
or pepper oil - for frying

Grate potatoes either using the largest holes on a four-sided hand grater,
or the grater attachment on a food processor.  Place potatoes in a colander
and rinse under cold water to remove the starch.  Be sure to allow potatoes
to drain well.  Grate onion, removing any excess moisture by placing in
colander and pressing with the back of a wooden spoon. Combine potato and
onion.  Beat eggs into mixture; stir in flour, baking powder, salt and
pepper.  If using a food processor, combine ingredients using plastic knife
attachment so potatoes remain in grated pieces. Heat 1/8" of oil in a large
skillet.  For each pancake, drop about 2 tablespoons of batter into the oil
and flatten with the back of a wooden spoon; the flatter the pancake, the
crisper it will be. Brown well on both sides. Drain well on paper towels.
Keep the cooked pancakes warm in a 100 F oven. Serve with Pink Cinnamon
Applesauce (see recipe) and/or sour cream. Makes about 2 dozen regular size
or 5 dozen miniatures.  Pancakes may be made ahead of time and refrigerated
between layers of waxed paper when cooled. To reheat, place in a single
layer on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake uncovered at 450 F for 5 minutes,
or until crisp and hot.
