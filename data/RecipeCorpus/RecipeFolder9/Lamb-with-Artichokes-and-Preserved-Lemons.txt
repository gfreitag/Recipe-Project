Categories: Moroccan, Lamb, Preserve
Yield: 8 servings
3 tb Vinegar
12    Artichokes,small,wide
12    Moroccan preserved lemons
1/2 c  Calamata olives
2 tb Lemon juice (opt)
3 lb Boneless lamb shoulder
1    Small onion,chopped

Trim fat off lamb. Cut meat into 1 1/2" chunks. In a 5-6 quart pan, combine
lamb, onion, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and saffron. Cook, tightly covered,
over medium heat for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a bowl combine vinegar and 1 quart water. Trim off stems,
tough outer leaves, and sharp tips of artichokes, leaving pale, tender
interior leaves. Cut in half lengthwise; scoop out and discard hairy
chokes. As artichokes are trimmed, immerse in vinegar-water.
After meat cooks 30 minutes, turn heat high, uncover pan, and stir often
until juices evaporate and meat browns, 15-20 minutes. Stir in 2 cups
water; simmer, covered, for 1 hour.
Drain artichokes and add to lamb; simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. Add 8
preserved lemon quarters and olives; simmer, covered, until artichokes are
tender when pierced, about 10 minutes longer. Add 2 tablespoons liquid from
preserved lemons or lemon juice. Skim and discard fat from stew. Pour stew
into a bowl and garnish with remaining lemon quarters.
