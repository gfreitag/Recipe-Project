I saw this in Bon Appetit yesterday and decided to keep it.  I'll bet a
dollar to a doughnut that the recipe originally called for Linguica, but
was changed to kielbasa for the masses.  If you can't find smoked Linguica
or Kielbasa, Andouille would also be a good substitute. I hope to try this
when it gets cooler (like October -- grin)!  Hope it appeals to you, too.

Number of Servings:   8

Combine all ingredients in large pot.  Bring to boil, stirring
occasionally.  Reduce heat; simmer until thick, stirring occasionally,
about 2 hours.  Season with pepper.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead;
refrigerate.  Rewarm before serving.)
