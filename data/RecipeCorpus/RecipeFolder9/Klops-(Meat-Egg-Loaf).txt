Title: Klops (Meat-Egg Loaf)
Categories: Beef, Jewish
Yield: 6 servings
2    Garlic clove; crushed
1 ds Nutmeg
1 ds Allspice
Salt
Pepper
1 tb Parsley; chopped
6    Egg; hard-boiled, peeled
Margarine
2 lb Beef, minced
3 sl Bread; soaked
OR I tried:
1/2 c  Bread crumbs, Italian
2    Egg
4 oz Parsnips; grated
1/2 c  Stock
1    Carrot; grated
2    Onion; chopped*
Mix all the ingredients except the hard-boiled eggs and the margarine. Put
half the mixture into a well-greased loaf pan (I found that I didn't need
to oil the pan), then put the whole hard-boiled eggs in a row down the
middle of the meat and cover with the remaining meat mixture.  Dab the top
with margarine as desired:  a lot if the meat is lean, very little if it is
fat.  Bake for 15 minutes in a 500 F. oven, then reduce the heat to 350 F.
for about 45 minutes, until brown on top.  Serve warm or cold in thick
slices so the egg centers each piece.
