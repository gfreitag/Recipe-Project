Title: Nikki's Eggplant Parmesan
Categories: Vegetables, Italian, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
-sliced
2 c  Italian Tomato Sauce
3/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1 lg Eggplant
Oil
1/2 lb Mozzarella cheese, thinly
Wash eggplant; do not peel.  Trim ends and cut eggplant crosswise into
rounds 1/4" thick.  Place on broiler pan or baking sheet, brush surface
with oil, and broil about 3" from heat 5 min, until lightly browned. Turn,
brush uncooked side with oil, and broil 3 min on other side. Place single
layer of cooked eggplant slices on bottom of 2 qt. baking dish (A deep
casserole produces a thicker, creamier, multilayered dish; a shallow
casserole gives fewer layers and a crustier top.  Take your pick.) Cover
with single layer of mozzarella cheese, spoon over enough sauce to cover,
and sprinkle generously with grated Parmesan.  Repeat layers until all
eggplant is used, adding the Parmesan cheese layer every other time. End
with tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese.  Any extra sauce can be poured over
top layer if needed for moisture and will filter down during baking. (At
this point the casserole can be refrigerated for several hours if you like
to work ahead.  Remove from refrigerator and allow to come to room
temperature  before baking or increase baking time 5 to 10 min.) Bake in
350 F oven 15 to 20 min, until sauce bubbles and cheese melts. Serve from
casserole with large cooking spoon, cutting cheese strands with scissors.
