Title: Italian-Style Lamb Chops
Categories: Italian, Lamb
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Sugar
2 ts Dried oregano leaves
2 ts Dried thyme leaves
3 tb Finely chopped parsley
8    Lamb rib chops,1" thick
1 c  Dry red wine
1/4 c  Chopped onion
3 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Lemon juice
1. Trim fat from chops and discard. Rinse chops and place in a heavy
plastic food bag. Add wine, onion, soy sauce, lemon juice, sugar, oregano,
and thyme. Seal bag; rotate to mix ingredients well. Chill at least 30
minutes or up to 6 hours; turn occasionally.
2. Lift out chops, draining; reserve marinade. Place chops on a lightly
oiled rack on a broiler pan. Broil chops about 6" from heat, basting
several times with marinade. Turn chops once to brown evenly, and cook
until done to your taste. For medium-rare (still pink in center; cut to
test), allow 8-10 minutes. Transfer chops to a warm platter; sprinkle with
parsley.
