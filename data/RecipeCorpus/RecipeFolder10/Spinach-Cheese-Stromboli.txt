Title: Spinach Cheese Stromboli
Categories: Italian, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Parmesan
3 tb Butter; in pieces
1/2 lb Mozzarella, sliced
1 ts Salt
2 tb Butter; melted
1 c  -Ice water (without cubes)
Sesame seeds
1 pk Yeast
2 lb Ricotta
2 ts Sugar
1 pk Spinach, frozen chopped
-(cooked)
1/3 c  -Warm water
4 c  Flour
Preheat oven to 200 degrees for 15 minutes and turn off.  Combine yeast,
sugar and warm water in a small mixing bowl.  Set aside for 5  minutes
until foamy.  In the workbowl of a food processor, add flour, butter pieces
and salt. Process for 20 seconds.  Add ice water to yeast.  With the
processor running, add yeast-water mixture gradually, until all of the
moisture is absorbed and the dough leaves the side of the bowl. Process for
an additional 60 seconds.  Transfer dough from the workbowl to a large
greased mixing bowl. Cover with a kitchen towel and place in warm off oven.
Allow to rise until doubled, approximately 1-1/2 hours.

In a medium mixing bowl, combine ricotta, spinach and parmesan cheese.

Punch down the risen dough and transfer to a floured rolling surface. With
quick, hard strokes, roll dough into a large rectangle, approx- imately 1/2
inch thick.  Layer one-half of the mozzarella cheese evenly down the center
leaving approximately three inches of exposed  dough on either side. Top
with ricotta-spinach mixture and the remaining mozza- rella. Overlap the
exposed dough over the cheese mixture and pinch well on all sides to seal.

Transfer to a large cookie sheet, seam side up.  Cover with a kitchen towel
and return to the warmed oven. Allow to rise until doubled, ap- proximately
45 minutes. Brush loaf with melted butter and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes or until loaf is well browned and
hollow sounding when thumped.
