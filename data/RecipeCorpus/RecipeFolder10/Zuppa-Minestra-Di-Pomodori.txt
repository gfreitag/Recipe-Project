and puree in an electric blender.

Rinse the saucepan and dry well. Place over medium heat and melt the
butter. Blend in the flour, stirring vigorously about 1 minute. Add the
Seasoned Chicken Broth, stirring constantly with a large wooden spoon until
the mixture comes to a full boil.

Cover and cook over low heat about 12 minutes. Add the tomato puree to the
thickened broth and cook over low heat approx. 15 minutes longer.

Taste and add the sugar, if the broth seems too acid. Serve hot in bowls or
chill well and serve cold. If desired, float the slices of Italian bread on
top.
