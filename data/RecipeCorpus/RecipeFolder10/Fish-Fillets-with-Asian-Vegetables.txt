1/4 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Sesame oil
1/4 ts Pepper
1 ts Minced garlic
2 ts Finely minced ginger
2 lb Fish fillets
10 oz Sliced water chestnuts

1 c  Court bouillon
HEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Arrange the fish fillets in a baking dish. Place the
water chestnuts and bamboo shoots in a colander, and pour boiling water
over them to remove the tinny taste. Arrange the vegetables around the
fish. Also arrange the scallions and snow peas. Bring the court bouillon to
a simmer, along with the soy, sesame oil, pepper, garlic and ginger. Pour
this over the fish, cover the fish with a sheet of buttered wax paper,
buttered side down, and bake for 7 minutes. Remove from the oven, drain the
cooking liquids, and reduce them by half. Serve immediately, dividing the
fish among the plates along with the vegetables. This will serve 6.
