Title: Zabaione Marsala
Categories: Italian, Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
- such as Florio or
- Pellegrino
Cinnamon
4    Egg yolks
1/3 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Sweet Sicilian Marsala
Try substituting other wines (or liqueurs) for the Marsala; a combination
of strong coffee and brandy also makes a flavorful, though not traditional,
Zabaione.

BRING A QUART OF WATER to a simmer in a small saucepan. Place the egg yolks
in a heat-proof bowl and whisk by hand until liquid. Whisk in the sugar in
a stream, then the Marsala. Regulate the heat under the pan so that the
water simmers gently, then place the bowl over the pan so that the bottom
of the bowl is above the surface of the water. Whisk vigorously; the
Zabaione will begin to absorb air fairly quickly. Continue whisking for a
total of 4 minutes, until the Zabaione is very aerated and thickened. Pour
into stemmed glasses, dust with a dash of cinnamon and serve immediately.
Though not traditional, you may wish to serve the Zabaione cool: After
whisking until thickened, continue whisking by hand, with a hand mixer set
at medium speed, or in a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the whip, until the
Zabaione is cool.
