Title: Justin Wilson's Boiled Crawfish
Categories: Fish/sea
Yield: 10 servings
Garlic
24    Small potatoes
Smoked sausage
Corn
50 lb Live crawfish
4    Boxes salt (no size mentione
6    Pouches crab boil
9    Lemons
8 oz Cayenne pepper
5 lb Small white onions
Bring seasonings to boil for 10 minutes.  Add potatoes, corn, and smoked
sausage.  Boil for another 10 minutes. Add crawfish. Bring back to boil.
Cut fire off immediately. Let soak for 20 to 30 minutes. Drain. Peel and
eat.
While water is coming to a boil, cull and clean crawfish. Rinse well
with garden hose and remove any dead ones.
Always wear gloves when you fool with crawfish, but remember, they can
still pinch you through gloves. Justin Wilson writes, "Not everybody likes
the fat, but I do, and I love to dig my finger into the head and scoop it
out.  During crawfish season, my finger stays yellow from one end to the
other." From Justin Wilson's "Outdoor Cooking With Inside Help."
