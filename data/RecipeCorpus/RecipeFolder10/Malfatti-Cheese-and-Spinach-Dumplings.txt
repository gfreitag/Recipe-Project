Title: Malfatti Cheese and Spinach Dumplings
Categories: Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
Pepper
Freshly grated nutmeg
Flour
6 tb Butter, melted
4 lb Spinach
Salt
2 c  Ricotta
2    Eggs
1 1/2 c  Freshly grated parmesan
Wash the spinach and remove the stems.  In a large pan with the lid
on, steam the leaves with a little salt in the water that clings to them,
turning them over, until they crumple. Strain and squeeze every bit of
water out with your hands: this is all-important and is the secret of
success (otherwise the dumplings would fall apart). Finely chop the leaves
Mash the ricotta and stir in the eggs, half the parmesan, salt,
pepper, nutmeg and spinach.  Work very well, shape into balls the size of a
walnut and roll in flour.
Fill a large saucepan halfway with water, bring to the boil and very
carefully drop in the dumplings. Keep the water barely simmering until the
rise to the surface - they do so very quickly.
Lift them out very carefully with a slotted spoon and serve very hot
with melted butter and the remaining parmesan.
