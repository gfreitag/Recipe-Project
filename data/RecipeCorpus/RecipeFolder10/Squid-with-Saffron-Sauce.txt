FOR THE SAFFRON SAUCE
Clean the squid and chop the tentacles.  Heat the oil in a large frying pan
and cook the onion and garlic until soft but not brown.  Add the tentacles
and cook for 5 minutes. In a mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, Parmesan,
ham, bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and parsley.  Add the tentacles and mix
thoroughly.

Stuff the squid with the mixture and close the openings securely with a
toothpick. Make the sauce.  Heat the oil in a heavy fireproof casserole or
frying pan that will hold the squid comfortably in one layer.  Saute the
onion and garlic until they are soft.  Add the stuffed squid and the
remaining ingredients, except the parsley.  Simmer, covered, for 20
minutes, basting the squid with the sauce, if necessary.

Uncover the squid and cook for 35 minutes longer.  Correct the seasoning
and baste frequently.  Remove the bay leaf, sprinkle the squid with the
parsley, and serve.
