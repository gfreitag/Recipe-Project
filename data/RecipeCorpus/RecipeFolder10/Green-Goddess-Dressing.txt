Title: Green Goddess Dressing
Categories: Salads
Yield: 1 servings
1/8 c  Sugar
1/8 c  Tarragon vinegar
1/4 c  Parsley; chopped
1/2 c  Green onion; minced
1 1/2 dr Green food coloring
Salad greens
1/4 pt Sour cream
1/8 c  Tarragon vinegar
1/4    Anchovy paste; tube
1/8 ts Rosemary
1/8 ts Oregano
1    Garlic clove; fresh, mashed
Mix the mayonnaise and sour cream until well blended.
Add the tarragon vinegar and anchovy paste and blend.
Let stand in the refrigerator for an hour.  Blend the rosemary, oregano
and fresh garlic with the sugar and vinegar and let this mixture stand an
hour at room temperature. Combine the two mixtures and blen in the onion
and parsley.  Add food coloring as desired.
Store in glass jar in the refrigerator.  Use as needed. Makes about 1 1/2
qts. My changes:  I eliminate the tarragon vinegar in the mayo mixture, and
use 1/4 cup tarragon vinegar in the herb mix. I use green onions (4 or 5)
including tops.  I use 1 clove of garlic, pureed. I use 1 to 1 1/2 cups of
parsley.  I do not put any food coloring in the mixture. I do the salad
dressing in my food processor.
Even a friend of ours who NEVER eats salad, eats it at our house when I
make this dressing!
