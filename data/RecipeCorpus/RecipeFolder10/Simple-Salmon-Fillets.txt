Title: Simple Salmon Fillets
Categories: Fish/sea
Yield: 2 servings
Salt
Pepper; white
2 tb Mayonaise
3/4 lb Salmon; fillets are best
1    Lemon
1 ts Dill; dried or better, fresh
Hopefully you selected 2 nice fillets. Preheat the oven to 400F. Place the
fillets skin side down in a baking dish (I use glass). Squeeze the lemon
over and lightly sprinkle with salt and some white pepper.
Then spread the dill over the fillets and let set for fifteen minutes--if
you have the time!  Spread the Mayo evenly over the entire surface and cut
end(s) of the fillets (just like spreading peanut butter).
Place on a high shelf in the oven (just under the broiler element). Bake
for 10 to 15 minutes for each inch of thickness. Then kick the broiler in
for a few minutes, just until you see some browning of the mayo. * This
technique will give you delicious, moist salmon every time--just don't
overdo the cooking!  The broiler bit isn't mandatory, it just gives a nice
finish.  If you skip the broiler then just add a few minutes to the baking
time.
