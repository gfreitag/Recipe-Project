Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 servings
5 tb Flour
3    Baking potatoes peeled/cubed
1 c  Oil
1    Large onion, peeled and dice
3    Eggs
1 ts Salt
1 pn Black pepper
PUREE THE ONION, EGGS, salt, pepper and flour in a blender or food
processor fitted with the steel blade, scraping down the sides of the bowl
as necessary. Add the potato cubes and process until the potatoes are
finely chopped, but not pureed. Scrape the mixture into a mixing bowl, and
press a sheet of plastic wrap directly into the surface of the batter to
prevent discoloration. Allow the batter to sit for 15 minutes. Heat the oil
in a large skillet over medium high heat to a temperature of 375F. Add the
potato batter in 1/3-cup pancakes, and fry until golden and firm on the
underside. Turn, and fry until golden. Drain well on paper towels. Serves
6. Note: The pancake batter can be made up to four hours in advance and
kept at room temperature, with the sheet of plastic wrap pushed directly
into the surface. The pancakes can be made in advance and reheated for 5
minutes in a 375F oven.
