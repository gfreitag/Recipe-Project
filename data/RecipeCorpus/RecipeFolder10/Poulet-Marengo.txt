Title: Poulet Marengo
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Dry white wine
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1/2 ts Thyme; dried
1    Bay leaf
16    White onions;peeled/whole
3 lb Chicken;cut in 8 pieces
3 tb Olive oil; use a good grade
4    Shallots; minced
1    Garlic clove; crushed
1 tb Flour
--------------------------USE SMALL BOILING ONIONS--------------------------
2 c  Tomatoes; canned/cut up
Fresh chopped parsley
5 tb Butter
2 ts Sugar
1/4 lb Mushrooms; sliced
Season the chicken with salt and pepper. In a heavy casserole, heat the oil
and brown the chicken on all sides. Add the shallots and garlic and cook
for 4 or 5 minutes...don't let the vegetables burn. Sprinkle flour over the
chicken and turn the pieces. Add wine, chicken stock, thyme, and bay leaf.
Cover and simmer. Meanwhile, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a medium
skillet and add the onions. Sprinkle with the sugar and cook until golden
and glazed, shaking the pan often. Transfer the onions to a plate and clean
the skillet. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoon butter in the skillet, add
sliced mushrooms and saute for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring gently. Remove and
add to simmering chicken, along with the onions and tomatoes. Recover the
heat and simmer 20 minutes more. Adjust seasoning to taste. Sprinkle with
the chopped parsley and serve. I don't have any idea where I got this
recipe, as it is one of the many handwritten in my own personal cookbooks.
I can only tell you that I have used this recipe many times, with success.
I hope you like it too! Barb
