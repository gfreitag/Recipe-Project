George Washington's mother's recipe uses no ginger. Fruit juice or coffee
may be substituted for brandy. Cream shortening and orange rind together.
Add brown sugar gradually and cream thoroughly. Blend in well beaten eggs.
Beat hard for 1-2 minutes to make a smooth batter. Sift flour, soda, salt
and spices together and add to creamed mixture alternately with the
molasses and mix of orange juice/brandy. Add raisins. Pour in well greased
and floured 8" X 12" X 2-1/2" pan. bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes.
