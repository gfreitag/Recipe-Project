This is a good hodgepodge of ingredients, and is quite tasty.  Really good
on Sandwiches!

Saute the chopped onion, garlic and olive oil in a saute skillet (at least
8"), until glassy. Add the Green pepper, mushroom and HALF the Newman's
Dressing, reduce heat and continue to saute until peppers are cooked (no
longer crunchy).  Add seasoning to personal preference.

Preheat oven to 425*.

Meanwhile in a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs (I usually just take
stale bread and tear it up into small pieces), one can of the tomato paste,
cheeses and Tofu.  Beat the egg separately, and add to Tofu-Bread mixture.
Combine until bread is thoroughly saturated.  Add sauteed vegetables and
remaining Newman's Dressing.

The Meatloaf mixture should be cohesive enough to form into a loaf, but not
soggy.  If the mixture is too soggy, add more bread.  If the mixture is too
crumbly, add more dressing, or tomato paste.  Tofu has a tendency to
separate, so the more bread and cheeses, the better.

Spray a loaf pan with a non-stick cooking spray, and spoon tofu mixture
into pan, spreading to an even level.  Spoon remaining can of Tomato paste
over tofu mixture, and spread evenly over the top.  Bake in 425 * oven
15-25 minutes, or until juices bubble up around the edges.

Delicious as an entree, even better sliced on sandwiches.  Refrigerate
covered, or loaf can be frozen.
