Yield: 4 servings
1 md Ripe, flavorful tomato

1/2 tb Fruity olive oil
1 tb Chopped fresh basil leaves

TURN ON YOUR BROILER and adjust the rack to about 6 inches from the heat.
In a large, heavy oven-proof skillet, heat the oil until hot and almost
smoking. Add the breasts and saute them over medium heat until lightly
browned on 1 side, about 3 minutes. Turn, season with salt and pepper, and
place a slice of tomato with a piece of cheese on top of each cooked side
of breast. Drizzle on the olive oil, season with black pepper and cook for
about 1 minute. Transfer the pan to the broiler and cook until the cheese
is hot and starts to melt slightly on top. Remove the pan, sprinkle on the
basil, and serve at once.
