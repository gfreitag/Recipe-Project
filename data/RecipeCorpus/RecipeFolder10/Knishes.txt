Yield: 1 servings
-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
Vegetable oil,
1    Egg yolk;  mixed with
1 tb Water
3 c  Flour; sifted
1/2 ts Salt,
1 c  Water,
1    Egg; slightly beaten,
-------------------------------POTATO FILLING-------------------------------
3 c  Onion; chop  fine
Salt & pepper; to taste
4 c  Potato; cooked, mashed
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
Saute onion in oil until tender and lightly browned and them mix with pota-
toes, salt & pepper. Adjust seasoning. ASSEMBLY Measure flour, baking
powder & salt in large bowl. Add water, egg & 1 Tblsp-->oil. Stir until
dough holds together.  Put on a lightly floured surface & knead until
smooth and elastic, using only enough extra flour to keep dough from
sticking-this takes about 5 minutes.  Put dough on lightly floured board,
cover w/large bowl and let sit for 1/2 hour. Divide dough into 4 pcs. Roll
out each piece into a 12" square on a lightly floured sur- face. Cut in
half to make two 6"  wide strips. Brush lightly with---> oil. Spoon 1/8 of
the filling down the center of each strip (the long way) Fold 1 long side
over the filling  & roll to the other side.  This will make a long roll.
Pinch edges together. Repeat with rest of dough & filling. Put rolls on
lightly oiled cooky sheets with the seam side down. Score with the blunt
edge of a knife at 1-1/2"  intervals,  do
not cut through.  Brush with egg yolk mixture & bake
in a preheated  375 ----> oven for 30 minutes,  or until golden brown.
Remove  from oven & cut all the way through where scored. If you are
freezing these, allow to cool to room temperature, place on cookie sheet &
put in freezer un- til frozen. Wrap well in plastic, over wrap with
aluminum foil & return to freezer. To reheat, preheat oven to 375 degrees
and
bake for 15-20  minutes, or until hot. Hope you enjoy these! Susan, NJ
