Yield: 16 servings
2    Bay Leaves

1/2 c  Ripe Olives, Sliced

1/2 c  Stuffed Olives, Sliced
2 ts Sugar
8 oz Canned Mushrooms
1/2 ts Red Pepper, Crushed
4 lb Spaghetti
1 tb Season-All
Parmesan Cheese, Grated
1/4 ts MSG
3 lb Beef Roast
1/2 ts Oregano Leaves
1/2 ts Basil Leaves
3 ts Salt
1/2 ts Parsley, Finely Chopped
1/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Rosemary Leaves, Crushed
1/4 c  Olive Oil

4    Garlic, Squashed
24 oz Tomato Paste
1    Onion, Finely Chopped
1 qt Water
Long, slow simmering of meat and herbs produces the base for this
incomparable sauce. Season roast with salt; dredge with flour. In Dutch
oven brown slowly on all sides in hot olive oil.  Add hot water, cover and
cook slowly 3 hours or until meat almost falls apart. Tear into small
pieces with fork. Add remaining ingredients except spaghetti and cheese.
Cover tightly and simmer 2 hours longer, stirring occasionally. Remove
cover and continue cooking until sauce thickens to desired consistency.
Cook spaghetti following directions on package, allowing 1 pound for four
servings. Ladle sauce over spaghetti. Top with cheese. Makes about 3-1/2
quarts sauce, enough for 4 pounds spaghetti. NOTE: Since you may not need
such a large quantity of spaghetti, freeze extra sauce in half-pint, pint
or quart freezer jars and use as needed. I prefer to use rump roast, but
chuck or round is acceptable.
