Title: Crispy Pecan Fish Fillet
Categories: Fish/sea
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 lb (1 stick) unsalted butter
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 c  Chopped pecans
1 c  Chopped parsley
1/2 c  Freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 1/2 lb Fillets (catfish, snapper,fl
1 c  Milk
2 c  Yellow cornmeal
1 ts Tabasco
1/2 ts Salt
WASH THE FISH FILLETS under cold running water, and place them in a bowl
with the milk, Tabasco and salt. Allow them to sit at room temperature for
15 minutes. Just before cooking, drain the fillets and dredge them in the
cornmeal. Heat 2 T of the butter and vegetable oil in a skillet over medium
high heat. Fry cornmeal covered fillets until crispy and brown, about 2
minutes on a side--don't crowd the pan. Remove from the pan with a slotted
spatula, drain on paper towels. Repeat until all fish is fried. Keep warm.
Pour grease out of the skillet, and add the remaining butter. Place over
medium heat, and when it has melted, add the nuts. Stir constantly while
the nuts brown. Add parsley and lemon juice and stir to combine. Pour sauce
over fish fillets and serve immediately.
