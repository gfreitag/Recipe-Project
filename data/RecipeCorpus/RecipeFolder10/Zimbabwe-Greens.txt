The greens used in his homeland aren't available here, but Reneth Mano
finds collard greens an excellent substitute.

Finely shred the greens, discarding tough stems. Place in a saucepan with
the water. Bring to boil and cook, stirring occasionally, just until greens
are crunchy-tender (don't overcook). Drain greens, reserving liquid. Return
greens to medium heat; add tomato and onions. Heat through, stirring
frequently.

Thin peanut butter with 3/4 cup of the reserved cooking liquid, then add to
vegetables. Heat, stirring constantly, until greens have a creamy
consistency, adding more reserved liquid if mixture seems too thick. Taste,
and add salt if needed.

Serves 4.
