1/2 pt Heavy cream; whipped
FOR THE PATE BRISEE, stir the flour and sugar together in a mixing bowl.
Cut the chilled butter into small pieces and drop into the flour.  With
your fingers, lightly and quickly rub the butter and flour together until
the mixture becomes crumbly, or cut it in with a knife or pastry cutter.
Whisk together the egg yolk, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon of water.
Sprinkle the liquid over the butter-flour mixture and continue to stir or
rub this mixture between your fingers until a ball of dough forms.  Be
careful not to overwork the dough.  If the mixture is crumbly, add up to
one more tablespoon water, sprinkling it over the dough and lightly
kneading it into a ball.

On a floured board and with a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into
a large circle.  Gently lift it into a 9- or 10-inch pie plate or tart tin.
Patch any holes in the crust with bits of dough and trim the edges. Flute
the crust.  Chill for 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 375 F.

Place a sheet of aluminum foil in the bottom of the crust and fill it with
dried beans or rice to weigh it down during baking.  Bake for 15 minutes.
Remove the crust from the oven and carefully lift out the foil and beans.
Bake for 5 minutes more.  Cool.

TO MAKE THE FILLING, heat in a small saucepan 2 cups of the blueberries, 2
tablespoons of water, and the sugar.  Crush a few berries with a spoon to
release the juice.  When the berries have softened and become juicy, add
the cornstarch mixture.  Simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally, until the mixture thickens.  Remove it from the heat and fold
in one more cup of blueberries.  Pour the berry mixture into the baked pie
shell.  Top with remaining 2 cups blueberries.  Cool for at least one hour.

Serve plain or topped with fresh whipped cream, if desired, or sweetened
Creme Fraiche.
