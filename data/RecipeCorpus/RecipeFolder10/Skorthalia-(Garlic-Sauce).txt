5    Garlic cloves
1/4 c  White vinegar
Salt
125 g  Crustless stale white bread
Makes: 1 1/2 cups

Soak halved garlic cloves in vinegar for 10 minutes.  Remvoe garlic to a
mortar, add 1/2 teaspoon salt and pound to a paste.   Soak bread in cold
water and squeeze dry.  Crumble into small particles and gradually blend
into garlic, adding a little vinegar to smooth the mixture.

When well pounded and smooth, transfer to a bowl if mortar is small.
Gradually beat in ground almonds and olive oil alternately with remaining
vinegar.  Beat in lemon juice and add salt to taste.  If mixture is very
thick, beat in a little more oil or lemon juice, depending on flavour
balance.  Mixture should be the consistency of stiff mayonnaise.

Turn into a serving bowl and serve with fried fish, squid, fried or boiled
vegetables or as directed in recipes.

Food processor or blender method:  Soak garlic as above.  Place all
ingredients except oil in container and process or blend until smooth.
Gradually beat in oil.  Adjust seasoning, flavour and consistency as above
and blend until smooth.  Do not over-beat as mixture could heat and curdle.
