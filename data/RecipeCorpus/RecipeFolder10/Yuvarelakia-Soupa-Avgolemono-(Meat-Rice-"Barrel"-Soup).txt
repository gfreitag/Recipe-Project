Karen Mintzias
1 lb Ground beef, veal or lamb
1    Onion; grated
2    Garlic cloves; crushed (opt)
6 tb Raw long-grain white rice
Chopped fresh parsley
2 tb Chopped dill, mint or basil
1 ts Dried oregano or thyme
In a large bowl, combine the meat, grated onion, garlic, rice, 3
tablespoons chopped parsley, the mint, oregano, salt and pepper, and 1 egg,
slightly beaten. Knead for a few minutes, then shape into walnut- sized
barrels and set aside.

In a soup pot, bring the water or stock to boil with the chopped onion,
celery and carrot, and salt and pepper to taste. Lower the heat and add the
meat-rice barrels. Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes, then remove from the
heat.

To prepare avgolemono, beat the two remaining eggs for 2 minutes.
Continuing to beat, gradually add the lemon juice. Then add 1 cup of the
hot broth by droplets, beating steadily, until all has been added. Add to
the soup and heat, being careful not to let it boil.  Serve hot, garnished
with parsley.

Note: This soup is frequently made without the additional vegetables added
to the liquid.  Also, you may enjoy this soup without avgolemono, in which
case add 1/2 cup canned tomato sauce to the liquid and reduce the water to
4 1/2 cups.
