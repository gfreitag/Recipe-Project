Wash the kidney, remove membranes and fat, and cut kidney in 1" cubes. Cube
the steak into 1" cubes.  Melt the shortening in a heavy pot. Add the
onions and cook, stirring often, until well browned. Add the steak and
kidneys.  When the meat is browned on all sides, pour on 2 cups of boiling
water, Worcester, salt, and pepper.  Cove and cook over a very low heat for
1 1/2 hours, or until the steak is tender. Preheat the oven to 400 F. Blend
the butter with the flour to make a beurre manie. Drop small pellets of
this paste into the sauce and stir to thicken it. Put meat and sauce into a
deep pie plate and sprinkle with parsley. If you wish to use a pastry
topping, roll out the dough and cover the pie plate. Slash the top, crimp
the edges, and bake about 30 minutes, or until well browned.

Pastry:  Mix the flour and salt. Cut in the shortening with a pastry
blender.  Combine lightly only until the mixture resembles coarse meal or
very tine peas; its texture will not be uniform but will contain crumbs and
small bits and pieces.  Sprinkle water over the flour mixture, a tablespoon
at a time, and mix lightly with a fork, using only enough water so that the
pastry will hold together when pressed gently into a ball.
