If using fruits with seeds, remove the seeds first; other fruits may be
combined in the blender, poured over ice and enjoyed. Some of the most
delicious frescos are made with mulberry, soursop, papaya and starfruit,
but they can also be made with peaches or strawberries - or with home grown
canteloupe. After pureeing, you can adjust the sweetness to taste.

Peel and seed melon, chop coarsely. In blender, puree melon, water, lime
juice and sugar until frothy and smooth. Divide among 4 glasses, adding ice
if desired. Serve immediately.
