You asked for a veal stuffing on Oct 1. Here's a recipe that I created for
stuffing a breast of veal that serves 6 people. It's from my next book,
tentatively called "What's for Dinner?" and due out next year from Wm
Morrow & Co. *fresh or canned low-sodium UNROLL PANCETTA, CHOP INTO
1/4-INCH PIECES and place in a skillet with olive oil. Place skillet over
medium heat and cook 2 minutes. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring
occasionally, 2 minutes. Add lentils, risotto and broth. Turn heat to low,
cover and simmer until broth is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Remove from
heat, scrape contents of the skillet into a work bowl and add sage, salt
and pepper.    Michael Roberts
