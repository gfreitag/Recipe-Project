Title: Lamb and White Bean Stew
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Rosemary
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
2 tb Minced parsley
1 c  Dry red wine
2 c  Beef stock
3 c  Cooked Great Northern beans
3 lb Boneless lamb stew meat
6 tb Olive oil
1 c  Diced onions
1    Carrot, peeled and sliced
1 tb Minced garlic
1 cn (28 oz) crushed tomatoes,
1/2 ts Thyme
HEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Trim the meat of visible fat and gristle, and set
aside. Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a skillet over medium high heat.
Add the lamb and brown on all sides, being careful not to crowd the pan;
this will have to be done in batches. Remove the lamb with a slotted spoon,
and place it in an oven-proof casserole. Add the remaining fat to the pan,
and saute the onions, carrot and garlic, stirring frequently, until the
onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Scrape the mixture into the
casserole with the lamb. Add the tomatoes, thyme, rosemary, salt, pepper,
parsley, wine and stock to the pan, and bring to a boil over medium high
heat. Place the pan in the center of the oven and bake for 2 1/2 hours, or
until the lamb is beginning to become tender. Add the beans, and bake for
30 to 40 minutes. Serves 6 to 8. (The stew is even better if made a day or
two in advance and refrigerated tightly covered. Discard any fat that
hardens.) Reheat in a 350F oven, stirring occasionally but gently.
