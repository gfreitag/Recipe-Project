Title: Wick Fowlers Two Alarm Chili
Categories: Meats, Chili
Yield: 10 servings
1 tb Oregano; dried, crushed
1 tb Cumin; ground
6    Red peppers; 2" long (opt)
4 tb Chili powder
1 tb Paprika
2 tb Flour
3 lb Ground beef
2 1/2 c  Tomato sauce
1    Onion; chopped
Garlic to taste - chopped
1 ts Salt
1 ts Cayenne pepper
1 ts Tabasco Sauce
Sear the meat with the onions and garlic.  When meat is thoroughly browned,
put in tomato sauce, and add some water. Add all other ingredients. Cover
with 1/2" of water and stir well. Simmer at least an hour and a half, or
longer, stirring regularly.  Towards the end, skim the grease and add the
flour, mixed with warm water, to thicken. Serve by itself, or with beans,
(cooked separately) or with rice, corn meal mush. This is the recipe Mike
Roy swore by.  I found it published in the Mike Roy Cookbook #2, which I
received from my mother as a gift in 1966.
The recipe was originally from the Chili Appreciation Society
International, Los Angeles Chapter.
