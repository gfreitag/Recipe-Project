Title: Zeppoli
Categories: Desserts, Italian
Yield: 20 servings
1    Egg yolk
Vegetable oil
- for deep frying
1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
2 tb Butter
1 pn Salt
1 c  Flour
3    Eggs, whole
As made in Naples for the Feast of San Giuseppe, these crullers are piped
from a pastry bag into ring shapes. After being fried, their centers are
filled with pastry cream and cherry preserves.

PUT BUTTER AND SALT into a saucepan with 1 cup water. Boil until butter
dissolves. Off heat, dump in flour all at once and stir rapidly to mix.
Return pan to medium-high heat and cook, still stirring rapidly, until
mixture is smooth and begins to coat bottom and sides of pan. Remove pan
from heat and, one at a time, add eggs and extra yolk, stirring briskly
until each addition is absorbed. Let mixture cool to room temperature. Put
confectioners' sugar into a brown paper bag. Heat deep-frying oil to 375F.
Using 2 teaspoons, drop in nuggets of dough about the size of a small
walnut. Fry a few at a time for 5-to-6 minutes each. As they cook, the
zeppoli will rise to the surface, turn over when their bottom halves are
golden brown, and finally rupture slightly and puff further as the interior
dough expands. Remove them from the oil when golden brown, firm, and hollow
inside. (Check one from the first batch, and if the interior is at all
soggy, cook the rest longer.) Drain zeppoli briefly on paper towels, then
toss in the bag with confectioners' sugar. Serve at once.
