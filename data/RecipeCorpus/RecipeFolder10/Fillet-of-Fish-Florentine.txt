Title: Fillet of Fish Florentine
Categories: Fish/sea
Yield: 6 servings
1/3 c  Cream
1/2 c  Grated Swiss cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
21 oz Frozend spinach, cooked per
2 lb Fish fillets
1 1/2 c  Court bouillon
3 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
HEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Make the spinach according to package directions,
and drain in a colander, pressing with the back of a spoon to extract as
much liquid as possible. Place the fish fillets in a baking dish, and bring
the court bouillon to a simmer on the stove. Pour the liquid into the
baking dish, cover with a sheet of buttered wax paper, buttered side down,
and bake for 5 to 7 minutes. Drain the cooking liquid, and reserve. Melt
the butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring
constantly, for 3 minutes. Whisk in the reserved cooking liquid, and bring
to a boil. Add the cream and cheese to the sauce, and stir until smooth and
bubbly. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Preheat an oven broiler. Stir
half the sauce into the spinach, and arrange the spinach on an ovenproof
serving platter. Arrange the fish on top of the spinach, and then top each
fillet with some of the sauce. Sprinkle the Parmesan on top of the sauce,
and place under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly browned.
Serves 6. If assembled a day in advance, refrigerate covered. Then, rather
than broiling, heat dish in a 350F oven until hot, about 15 minutes.
