minutes. Add remaining ingredients and cook another 20 minutes.
Sauce keeps well refigerated, for 3-4 days. Makes about 6 cups.

Mix 2 cups of the sauce above with the clam juice. Place shrimp in the
bottom of a heavy skillet or casserole. Cover with the sauce and top with
the Feta. Place skillet on high heat and bring to a fast simmer, covered.
Reduce heat and cook until shrimp are cooked, or about 8-10 minutes.
