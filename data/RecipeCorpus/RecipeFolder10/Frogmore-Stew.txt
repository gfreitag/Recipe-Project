Title: Frogmore Stew
Categories: Fish/sea, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
Liquid shrimp & crab boil
Lemon
2 x  Medium onions (optional)
2 lb Uncooked Shrimp in shell
4 x  Ears corn on the cob
4 x  Medium potatoes
2 lb Sausage (kilbasa, etc.)
Fill a large stew pot about 1/2 full of water.
squeese lemon juice into pot (throw in lemon rind just for the heck of
it).  Add as much of the shrimp and crab boil as you think is wise (I
usually use the whole bottle but my wife can barely stand 2/3 rds of a
bottle).  Cut potatoes into large chunks and add potatoes and corn on the
cob.  Cook for about 10 minutes and add cut up onions. cook untill the corn
and potatoes are done, then add shrimp and sausage (cut into "wheels") and
cook untill shrimp are done (about 3 to 4 minutes longer). This is a very
hot "stew" and should be served with something to cut the heat. I enjoy
slaw and some good bread. Hot mustard goes well with the sausage and tarter
sauce goes well with the shrimp. A six pack of your favorate beverage might
also be a good idea. Hope you enjoy 01/14 09:36 pm Rob Elliotte from
