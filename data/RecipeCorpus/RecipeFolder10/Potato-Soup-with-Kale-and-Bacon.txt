Title: Potato Soup with Kale and Bacon
Categories: Soups/stews
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Heavy cream
Chicken stock as necessary
5 ts Balsamic vinegar
1    Bunch chives
Diced green onion tops/botto
2 lb Boiling potatoes
3/4 lb Bacon
1 lb Kale
2    Cloves garlic
Salt and pepper
Peel potatoes and put in a pot with cold, salted water to cover. Cover pot
and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer, uncover, and cook until done,
about 25 minutes. Drain, reserving cooking liquid. Break up the potatoes
with a potato masher (they should be quite lumpy, not smooth). Meanwhile,
cook the bacon over low heat until crisp, turning often. Drain and chop
into 1/2 inch chunks. Pour off all but 2 TBS of the bacon fat, and, reserve
extra fat. Stem and chop the kale. Mince the garlic. Put half the kale and
half the garlic into the frying pan. Season with salt and pepper and cook
over medium heat until kale is wilted, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl.
Repeat using more bacon fat as needed. Return all kale to the fry pan and
add the heavy cream. Simmer over very low heat until the kale is tender,
about 10 more minutes. Combine potatoes with about 3 cups of the potato
cooking liquid and 1 cup of the chicken stock. Add more stock if needed to
get a good consistency. Add kale mixture (with the bacon) to the pot and
bring to a simmer. Season to taste with the vinegar and salt and pepper.
This is up to you as to how much vinegar you use. Mince the chives or green
onions and place in an extra bowl to top the soup. I hope you find this
excellent soup. It is great this time of year as it is much like a warm
German Potato salad.  If you pass this one up you will be the loser. Take
care from Ken/still looking for a name for his piranha in rainy but warm
