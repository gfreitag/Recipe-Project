Title: Green Pea and Peanut Salad
Categories: Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 10 servings
1 tb Sugar
1 tb Green pepper; chopped (opt)
1 tb Pimento; chopped (opt)
32 oz Frozen green peas
12 oz Spanish peanuts
8 oz Sour Cream
1 ts Water
Thaw peas and pat dry with paper towel (Spread out on a cookie sheet
covered with paper towel after they are thawed and the cover them with
another layer of paper towel and pat gently.) Put peas in a bowl and add
peanuts.  Mix sour cream sugar and water together and gently toss it into
the peas and peanuts.  Put into a pretty clear trifle dish and garnish with
green pepper and pimento. Fredi Stewart posted this recipe which came from
a co-workers trip to a restaurant on a vacation. I tried it for a Christmas
brunch and must say it got rave reviews from many--others didn't care for
it much.  It is unusual, and I liked it.  It is very colorful--and don't
say "Yuk" until you've tried it! Thanks Fredi.
