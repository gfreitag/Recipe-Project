Place chickens in large saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil.
Simmer until chickens are tender. Remove chickens from pan and set aside.
Remove backbones. Add chopped carrot, celery and onion and simmer 30
minutes.  Add chicken stock base and remove from heat. Strain and reserve
stock.  Melt butter and stir in 1 cup flour until smooth. Add to strained
reserved chicken stock. Simmer 5 minutes.  Add sherry and lemon juice, salt
to taste and, if desired, food color.

For dumplings, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, baking powder and 1/4 ts salt in
mixing bowl.  Cut in shortening until mixture resembles cornmeal. Stir in
milk until just blended. Place about 1/2 inch water in saucepan with wire
rack that comes 2 to 3 inches above water line. Cover rack with lightly
oiled waxed paper, oiled side up. With water gently simmering, drop
dumplings by tablespoons onto waxed paper, leaving room in between for
expansion.  Steam 8 minutes, uncovered, then cover and steam 7 minutes
longer.

Meanwhile, remove skin from cooked chickens and bone, if desired. Cut in
large pieces.  Place chicken pieces in casserole. Arrange dumplings on
chicken. Cover with sauce nd sprinkle with pea for color.
