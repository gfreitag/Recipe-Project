Karen Mintzias
6    Garlic cloves
Salt
1 c  Mashed potatoes
2 sl Stale white bread
Pound garlic with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a mortar until smooth.  Add mashed
potatoes and continue to pound and stir with pestle.  Soak bread (crusts
removed) in cold water and squeeze dry.  Add to potatoes and garlic,
pounding and stirring until smooth.  Gradually add olive oil, lemon juice
and vinegar, stirring vigorously.  When smooth and light, add salt and
pepper to taste.  Chill in a covered bowl before using.

Serve with hot or cold seafoods and fried or boiled vegetables.

Variation: Replace bread with 1/2 cup ground almonds or walnuts, or use
1-1/2 cups ground almonds or walnuts instead of the potatoes and bread.

Blender method:  Put all ingredients in jar of blender and blend at
moderate speed until ingredients are pulverised.  Increase speed for a few
seconds until light and smooth.  Do not blend too long at high speed for
the mixture heats and the oil separates.
