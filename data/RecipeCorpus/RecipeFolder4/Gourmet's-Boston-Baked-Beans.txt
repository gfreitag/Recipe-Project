Title: Gourmet's Boston Baked Beans
Categories: Vegetables, Pork/ham, Beans
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Dry mustard (english style)
1/4 ts Paprika
1 ts Onion, grated
2 c  Dried navy beans, picked ove
- and rinsed
3/4 lb Salt pork
1/2 c  Molasses
In a bowl, combine the beans with 4 cups cold water and let them soak
overnight.  Drain, reserving any remaining liquid.  Transfer them to a
small heavy kettle, and add fresh water to cover.  Simmer, covered, for 60
minutes.  Drain in a colander, reserving the cooking liquid and combining
it with the soaking liquid.

To the kettle, add a quarter lb. piece of salt pork and the beans and bury
the remaining piece of pork, well scored, in the center of the beans. In a
small bowl, stir together the molasses, 1/2 cup of bean liquid, mustard,
paprika, and onion.  Pour the mixture over the beans and stir in.

Bake the beans, covered, in the middle of a preheated 300f oven for 5
hours, stirring in some of the bean liquid at hourly intervals as necessary
to keep the beans just barely covered.  Remove lid and cook uncovered for 1
more hour.
