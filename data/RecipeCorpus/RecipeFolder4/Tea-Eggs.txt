In a bowl, soak the tangerine peel in water for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a
pan place the eggs and cover them with cold water.  Bring to a boil and
simmer for 15 minutes.  Turn off the heat and remove the eggs from the pan
with a slotted spoon and cool them under running water.  Tap each egg all
over with the back of a spoon to crack the shell thoroughly, but carefully
keeping the shell on and intact. Bring the water in the pan back to a boil
again, add the tea, star anise, salt, soy sauce, cinnamon, and soaked
tangerine peel.  Stir, then add the cracked eggs to the pan. Simmer for an
hour, turning the eggs often to ensure even coloring. Remove the pan from
the heat and let stand for an hour.  Remove the eggs, cool them, and then
remove the shells.  Serve the eggs cut into halves or quarters, with plum
sauce.  Makes 6 to 8 appetizer servings. NOTE: These are best when made the
day before.
