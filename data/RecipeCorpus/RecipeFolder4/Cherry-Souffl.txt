Title: Cherry Souffl
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1    Pinch of salt
Sugar to taste
3/4 c  Cherry pure
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
3    Egg whites
Pit and pure enough sour cherries to make 3/4 cup.  (My guess is that
something over 1 cup whole cherries will be required.)  Preheat the oven to
375øF.  Oil a 1-quart souffl dish and sprinkle it with sugar. Heat the
cherry pure in a small pan.  Add the lemon juice, salt, and sugar to
taste, and stir to blend; remove from the heat.  Beat the egg whites until
stiff but not dry and stir them into the hot pure until evenly blended.
Spoon into the souffl dish and bake for 20-25 minutes.
