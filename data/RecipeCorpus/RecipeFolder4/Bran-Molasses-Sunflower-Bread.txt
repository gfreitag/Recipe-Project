spoon, mix in all-purpose flour 1/2 cup at a time until dough forms soft
mass.  Knead on heavily floured surface until smooth and satiny, kneading
in more flour if sticky.

Grease large bowl.  Add dough, turning to coat entire surface. Cover bowl

Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.  Gently knead dough on lightly floured

Roll up jelly roll fashion, pinching seams to seal. Place seam side down in
prepared pans.  Cover with towel and let rise in warm draft-free area until

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 F.  Bake until loaves
pull away from sides of pans, about 45 minutes. Immediately remove from
pans.  Cool completely on racks.
