There is a subtle Spanish influence in anything Creole and this sauce is no
exception.  Not only is it perfect with all kinds of shellfish, but it will
also enhance all but the most delicate fish. Spoon it over poached eggs or
an omelet, or add a few cooked shrimp and pour over rice for a terrific
supper dish.  Prepare this sauce no more than one day in advance. Rewarm
over low heat before serving.

Melt the butter in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the pepper
and onion and saute until transparent, about 4 to 5 minutes. Then add the
mushrooms and saute 5 minutes longer. stir in the stock, garlic, and
tomatoes.  Season with salt, pepper, and thyme and simmer over low heat for
20 minutes.  Stir in the sherry and serve very hot.

Yield: About 1 1/2 cups of sauce.
