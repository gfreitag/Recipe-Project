Title: French Bread Ii
Categories: Breads, French
Yield: 6 servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
2 c  Very warm water
1    Egg white, unbeaten
5 3/4 c  Sifted flour
1 tb Sugar
2 ts Salt
Altitude: 5,000 ft. Yield: 2 loaves

In a large bowl, thoroughly mix 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast. Add
water and beat at medium speed of electric mixer for 2 minutes, scraping
bowl occasionally.  Gradually stir in 3 1/2 cups more flour, or enough
flour to make a soft dough.

Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup flour on bread board or pastry cloth. Turn dough
out on floured surface and knead until smooth and satiny, 5 to 10 minutes.
Shape into smooth ball.  Place in greased bowl, turning once to grease top.
Cover and let rise in a warm place (80-90 degrees) until double (about 1
hour).

Punch down.  Divide into halves.  Shape each half into a ball. Cover and
let rest 5 minutes.  Rub a little shortening on palms of hands. Roll each
ball of dough under the hands to form a long slender loaf about 3 inches in
diameter.  Start rolling at the center and gently work hands toward end of
loaf, repeating until loaf is shaped. Place loaves 4 inches apart on
lightly greased baking sheet. With a sharp knife, cut diagonal gashes abut
1/4 inch deep and about 1 1/2 inches apart into top of each loaf.

Cover and let rise until a little more than doubled (about 1 hour). Bake in
moderately hot oven (425 degrees) 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven, brush
with egg white.  Return to oven for 2 minutes. Remove from baking sheet and
cool on racks.

Hint:  For crustier loaf, bake bread with a shallow pan of water on lower
oven rack.
