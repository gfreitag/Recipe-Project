Title: Spice Bread (Irish)
Categories: Breads, Cakes, Irish
Yield: 8 servings
2 oz Chopped candied peel
6 oz Raisins, plain or golden
4 oz Butter
6 oz Golden syrup **
1 lg Egg, beaten
4 tb Milk
10 oz Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Mixed spice *
1/2 ts Ground ginger
4 oz Light brown sugar
Servings:  8

*  Equal parts of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. ** Lyons' Golden Syrup,
carried in some fancy groceries. If you can't find it, use Karo golden corn
syrup.

Sift the flour with the soda and baking powder, and the mixed spice and
ginger:  then add the brown sugar, chopped peel and raisins: mix. Make a
well in the center.  Melt the butter with the syrup over low heat, then
pour into the well in the mixture. Add the beaten egg and milk and mix very
well.  Pour into a greased 2 lb loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven at
325 F for 40-50 minutes, or until it tests done. This bread will keep moist
for several days, and actually improves somewhat during this period.
