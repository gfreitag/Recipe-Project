Title: Rosemary Sauce
Categories: Sauces, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Dry White Wine
1/2 c  Brown Stock (See Stocks)
1/2 c  Heavy Cream
2 tb Butter
1 lg Shallot, Chopped
1 tb Fresh Rosemary, Chopped
Rosemary and lamb seem to go together, naturally, whether the herb is
sprinkled on chops while grilling or incorporated in a savory sauce. This
sauce is also delicious with cold roast lamb or any of that butterflied
roast left over from the Sunday barbecue.  Inspired by a sauce once served
at New York City's American Harvest Restaurant, this makes a wonderful
addition to a summer menu.

Salt And Freshly Ground Black Pepper

Heat the butter in a medium-size heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the
shallot and saute until transparent, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the rosemary
and wine and cook over high heat until most of the liquid has evaporated,
about 3 to 4 minutes.  Stir in the stock and continue to cook over high
heat until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the heavy cream, and season,
then boil over medium heat for 3 minutes. Strain through a sieve lined with
cheesecloth if you prefer a smooth sauce; do not if a more textured sauce
is appropriate. The sauce should be very hot. Serve immediately.

Yield:  About 1 cup of sauce.
