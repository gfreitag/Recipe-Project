Title: Bread Stuffing
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Chopped parsley
2 tb Melted fat
1    Egg
1 sm Onion, chopped fine
4 c  Dry bread cubes
1 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1/8 ts Ginger
1/4 ts Poultry seasoning
Method #1: Soak bread in cold water & squeeze dry. Add seasoning & fat. Mix
thoroughly, add the egg, slightly beaten, & the onion.

Method #2: Soak bread in cold water & squeeze dry. Heat fat in a skillet,
add the bread, stir until fat is absorbed. Season to taste, add slightly
beaten egg & onion. Cool before filling bird.

I've tried it both ways - both GREAT! This is from The Settlement Cookbook.
You'll need to double this for a turkey.
