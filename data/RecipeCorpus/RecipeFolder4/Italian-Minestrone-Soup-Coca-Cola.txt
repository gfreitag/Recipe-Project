Remove the meat.  Strain the broth (should measure 2 quarts). Add ice cubes

Finely dice the meat, discarding any fat and bones (should be about 2

the meat.  Place over low heat while preparing the rest of the ingredients.

Pan-fry the bacon until crisp.  Add the bacon and the drippings and all the
remaining ingredients, except Parmesan cheese, to the broth. Cover and
simmer about 30 minutes, until the vegetables and macaroni are tender.
Serve sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, if desired. Makes about 3 quarts.
