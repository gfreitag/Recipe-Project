Prepared somewhat like Baba au Rhum, this cake is soaked in syrup.

Sift the flour, measure and sift into a bowl with the sugar, salt, baking
powder, and soda. Stir in the nuts, dates, cranberries, and orange peel.
Combine the eggs, buttermilk, and salad oil; stir into flour mixture until
well blended. Pour into a well-greased 10- inch tube pan; bake in a
moderate oven (350Ã¸) for 1 hour. Let stand about 15 minutes. Remove cake
from pan and place on a rack over a pan. Heat the sugar with orange juice
until dissolved; pour over cake, catching several times. Set cake in a deep
dish, and pour over remaining drippings.
