This is a new adaptation from a series of fish recipes I developed for
"people who don't like fish". The stock and juice combined with the onion
add a distinctive savory flavor. The combination makes it hard to
distinguish the individual flavors. This dinner takes less than ten minutes
to complete.

Cut the potatoes into one quarter inch slices and place into a pan of cold
water. Turn pot on high until it starts to boil. Add the carrots after
three minutes. Salt the water and reduce heat to medium. Cook until tender,
about six to seven minutes. Add broccoli about 2 minutes before the
potatoes are finished. Drain if finished before the fish, and place back in
hot pan. Add fresh pepper.

Saute onions in one half the oil, med-low heat in a ten inch teflon pan.
When they start to brown add the rest of oil. Place the fish fillet on top
fat side down and turn up heat to med- high. Saute until salmon turns white
on bottom. Add herbs and pepper. Add one quarter cup of water, chicken
stock and the orange juice. Lower heat and simmer about five minutes. Baste
occasionally. The salmon should be pink inside and not over done.

Cut the filet in half in the pan. Using a plastic spatula, pick up the fish
and onions and place in one half of plate. Add a spoon or two of sauce. Add
vegetables and arrange in semi-circle.
