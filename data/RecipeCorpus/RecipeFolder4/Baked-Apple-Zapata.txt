Use your favorite recipe for flour tortillas, or make dough from the recipe
on the Tortilla mix package. Divide the dough into 4, 2-inch balls. Roll
each into a 6-inch tortilla. Dust with flour, cover with plastic wrap and
set aside. In a saucepan, place apples with enough water to cover. Add
lemon juice. Cook over high heat until boiling 5 minutes. Add sugar,
cloves, cinnamon, and walnuts; continue cooking over low heat until
slightly thickened.  Combine cornstarch and water and add to mixture,
stirring until thick.  Remove from heat. Lay out tortillas; dust off excess
flour.  Spoon on 2 tablespoons of the apple mixture down the middle of each
tortilla.  Fold one side of the tortilla over the mixture; then fold the
remaining side over.  Fold in the ends and seal by moisting the tortillas
with a little water. Bake in a preheated, 400 degree F oven until lightly
browned.  Remove and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Serve with whipped
cream (at Cafe Noche, it is served with Tequila Sabayon sauce made with
tequila, egg yolks, and sugar. NOTE: Tortillas and apple mixture may be
made ahead several hours or a day
before. Recipe: Cafe Noche, 2409 Montrose Blvd, Houston, Texas --
