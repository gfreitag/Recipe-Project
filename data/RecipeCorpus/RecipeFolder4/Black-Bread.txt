cups all-purpose flour and rye flour.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured
surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, kneading in
up to 3/4 cup more all-purpose flour if necessary to form workable dough.
Add dough to prepared bowl, turning to coat entire surface. cover and let
rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

Grease two 3x2x7-inch loaf pans.  Punch dough down.  Turn out onto lightly
floured surface and let rest 3 minutes.  Knead 3 minutes. Divide dough in
half.  Roll each into 7x8-inch rectangle. Starting with long side, roll
dough up into cylinder. Tuck ends under and pinch seam to seal. Place seam
side down in prepared pans. Cover and let rise in warm draft-free area
until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.

bottom, about 45 minutes.  Remove bread from pans.  Let cool completely on
rack before serving.
