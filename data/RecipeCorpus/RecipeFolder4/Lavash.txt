This Middle Eastern sesame cracker bread keeps for months wrapped in
plastic or foil.  Store in a dry place.

Makes about 12 to 15 crackers

Grease or butter a large bowl; set aside.

Combine first 4 ingredients in mixing bowl.  Blend butter with 1 cup water
and add gradually to dry ingredients, beatng continuously. If dough seems
dry add more water as needed.  Beat or knead until dough is smooth and
elastic.  Place in greased bowl, turning to coat entire surface. Cover with
plastic wrap and hot damp towel and let rise in warm place until doubled in
bulk, about 1 to 2 hours.

Remove oven racks from gas oven; with electric oven place bottom rack in
lowest position and place baking sheet on rack.  Preheat gas oven to 350 F,
or electric oven to 375 F.  Divide dough into pieces about the size of
tennis balls.  Spread sesame seeds on large breadboard or countertop.
Working with one piece of dough at a time (keep remainging dough covered),
place on board and roll out as thinly as possible without tearing dough.

Bake lavash, one at a time, until light golden with darker highlights,
about 2 to 3 minutes on floor of gas oven, or about 13 minutes in electric
oven.  Cool on racks.
