Title: Saffron Butter Sauce
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 servings
3 tb Heavy cream
14 tb Unsalted butter, cold, cut i
-to 14 pieces
1/4 ts Saffron threads, crumbled
2 tb Shallot, minced
2 tb White wine vinegar
3 tb Dry white wine
In a small heavy saucepan, combine the saffron, shallot, vinegar, and wine.
Simmer the mixture until it is reduced to about 2 Tablespoons. Stir in the
cream and simmer the mixture, whisking occasionally, until the liquid is
reduced to 2 Tablespoons.

Season the mixture with salt and pepper.  Reduce heat to low, and whisk in
the butter, 1 piece at a time, but overlapping slightly to keep the sauce
from getting too hot.  Remove from heat, from time to time, as the butter
is whisked in.

Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Use with pasta
and/or seafoods.   Makes about 1 cup.
