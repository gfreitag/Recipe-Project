Spoon it over grilled veal chops or a crisp roast duck, and you will
present a memorable dish indeed. It is outstanding over noodles for a small
but rich first course.

Salt And Freshly Ground Black Pepper, To Taste

Melt the butter in a heavy medium-size saucepan over medium heat. Add the
shallots and garlic and saute until transparent, about 3 to 4 minutes. Then
add the cognac and flame. To do this, remove the saucepan from the heat and
touch a lighted match to the edge of the pan; the fumes of the cognac will
ignite.  Holding the pan away from you, allow the flames to die down
naturally.  Add the stock and cream and simmer over low heat until
thickened, about 15 to 20 minutes. Add the mushrooms and continue to simmer
3 to 5 minutes more.  Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.

Yield:  About 1 cup of sauce.
