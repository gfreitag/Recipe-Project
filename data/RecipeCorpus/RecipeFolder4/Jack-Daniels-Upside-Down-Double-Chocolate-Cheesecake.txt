Jack Daniel's Upside Down Double Chocolate Cheesecake **

In microwave-safe glass bowl, melt chocolate chips with milk in microwave
oven on high (100%) power 1 to 1 1/2 minutes or until smooth when stirred.
Set aside.

Meanwhile, in large bowl of electric mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar
until smooth.  Beat in eggs until well blended.  Beat in melted chocolate
mixture and whiskey until thoroughly blended. Spoon into buttered 9-inch
springform pan.

Bake in preheated 400-degree oven 15 minutes; reduce oven temperature to
350 degrees and continue baking 15 minutes.

Remove from oven and carefully spoon on Fudge Brownie Batter evenly,
starting at edges and working toward center.  Return to 350- degree oven
and bake another 35 to 40 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center
comes out almost clean. Cool completely; refrigerate until thoroughly
chilled.

Remove sides of pan from cake.  Spread Chocolate Ganache evenly over top of
cake.  Return to refrigerator and chill until ganache is set.  Makes 1
cheesecake, 10 to 12 servings.

Fudge Brownie Batter In large microwave-safe glass bowl, combine 2 squares
(1 ounce EACH) unsweetened chocolate with 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter.
Microwave on high (100%) power 1 to 1 1/2 minutes or until smooth when

thoroughly blended.  Stir in 1/2 cup flour, blending well. Stir in 1/4 cup
chopped walnuts, if desired.  Spread evenly over partially baked
cheesecake.

Chocolate Ganache In large microwave-safe glass bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups
chocolate chips and 1/3 cup whipping cream. Microwave on high (100%) power
