Raisin Puree is the basis for the dough of this rich-tasting, chewy bar.
The combination of orange and chocolate is a classic favorite. We
considered cutting the amount of chocolate in the recipe, thereby cut- ting
the fat, but in the end we agreed that the extra richness is worth the
extra grams of fat. (By Times Food Stylists) Sift together flour, baking
powder and salt into large bowl. Stir in oats and brown sugar. Beat egg
whites lightly in another bowl. Stir in Raisin Puree. Stir into flour
mixture along with chocolate, walnuts, and orange zest just until blended.
Spoon in 9-inch-square baking pan sprayed with non-stick vegetable spray.
