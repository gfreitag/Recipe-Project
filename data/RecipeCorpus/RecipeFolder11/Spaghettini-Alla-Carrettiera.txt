2 tb Vodka
10    Sprigs Italian parsley,
Coarsely chopped
1 lb Spaghettini
4 ts Ground red chile
1 lb Fresh tomatoes, cut up
3 cl Garlic
2 tb Olive oil
3/4 c  Heavy cream
Combine the chile, tomatoes, garlic and olive oil.  Simmer the sauce for
30 minutes and run through a food mill to remove seeds and skins.

Add the cream and vodka and simmer until the sauce is reduced.
