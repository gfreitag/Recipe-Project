Categories: Microwave, Soups/stews
Yield: 6 servings
-one good size handful
-plus some for garnish
Port Lemon juice
4    Cantaloupes
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
Fresh mint leaves about
Carefully cut three of the cantaloupes in half in a zig-zag
pattern using a very sharp knife.
Scoop out and throw away the seeds. Use a melon ball scooper
to scoop out the flesh of the melon; Take it down to the green
part.
Do the same thing with the remaining fourth cantaloupe. It
doesn't matter how you slice this one because all you will be
using is the flesh.
Place all of the scooped cantaloupe in a food processor. Add
the sugar and mint leaves, a splash of port and splash of lemon
juice. Be casreful not to over-process the mixture; it should
retain some texture.
Garnish with remaining mint leaves.
