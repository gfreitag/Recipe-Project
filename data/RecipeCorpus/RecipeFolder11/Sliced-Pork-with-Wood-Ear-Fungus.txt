sized pieces.  Place in a dish with the #1 seasoning ingredients. Mix well
and leave for 20 minutes.
Drain the Wood Ears, and chop finely. Wash and dry the spinach leaves and
chop coarsely.  Heat a wok, or large skillet and add the lard and frying
oil. Stir-fry the spring onion, garlic and chili peppers together for one
minute, then add the Wood Ears and spinach and stir-fry briefly. Push to
one side of the pan and add the sliced pork. Fry on both sides until
lightly colored, then stir in the other ingredients and continue to
stir-fry until the pork is almost cooked, about 1 1/4 minutes.
Pour in the pre-mixed #2 seasoning ingredients and simmer until the sauce
has thickened.  Add a dash of salt to taste, and serve. Steamed rice a
MUST.
