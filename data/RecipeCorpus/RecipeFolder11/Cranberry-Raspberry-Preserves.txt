Title: Cranberry-Raspberry Preserves
Categories: Fruits, Preserve
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Fresh orange juice
Grated zest of 1 orange
6 c  Raspberries (3 pints)
2 1/2 c  Sugar
3 c  Cranberries (12 oz. bag)
Stir together the raspberries and 1 cup of the sugar in a medium bowl and
let stand for 1 hour.

Stir the cranberries and the remaining sugar together in a nonreactive
shallow preserving pan and place over high heat.  Stir constantly so the
sugar does not burn until the cranberries begin to release juice, about 5
minutes.  Continue cooking until all the cranberries have popped and the
mixture is syrupy and comes to a boil.  Skim off any foam that forms on top
and continue to cook and stir until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes
more.

Add the raspberries and all their juice and cook for 10 minutes more. Stir
in the orange juice and zest.

Remove a small amount of the jam to a saucer and place in the freezer for 5
minutes.  If the mixture wrinkles when pused to one side, it is ready. If
not, continue cooking for 5 minutes and retest.

When the preserves are the right consistency, turn down the heat to a
simmer and ladle into hot sterilized jars.  Wipe the rims clean with a damp
towel and seal with new lids and metal rings.  Process in a hot-water bath
for 5 minutes.  Remove, cook, check seals, label, and store.

Makes 4 one pint jars.
