Wash lentils thoroughly by placing in bowl and covering with water. Remove
any that float, drain well. In heavy based skillet, heat ghee (or butter)
and fry onion, garlic and ginger a few minutes over medium heat until onion
is golden brown. Add tumeric and mix to combine well. Add lentils. Fry
mixture about 2 minutes. Add hot water and bring mixture to boil, then
reduce heat so mixture is just simmering. Cover and cook 15 to 20 minutes.
Add salt and garam masala. Stir well and finish cooking lentils until they
are soft and consistency of mixture is quite thick. If there's too much
liquid, remove cover so liquid will evaporate. Spoon into serving dish.
Sprinkle with coriander.
