Categories: India, Lamb
Yield: 6 servings
3    Cloves Garlic, Chopped
2 ts Chopped Fresh Ginger
1/2 ts Ground Red Chili Pepper
2 c  Coconut Milk
3/4 c  Boiling Water
1/2 c  Cold Water
2 lb Cubed Lamb
1/2 c  Unsalted Almonds
1 ts Saffron Threads
2 c  Unflavored Yogurt
2 ts Caraway Seeds
2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Ghee (Or Melted Butter)
4    1" Sticks Of Cinnamon
1/2 ts Cardamom Seeds
6    Whole Cloves
2 c  Chopped Onions
Drop the saffron threads into a small bowl or cup, add 1/3 of the boiling
water and soak for at least 10 minutes.  Pour the saffron and its soaking
liquid into a deep bowl and stir in the yoghurt, caraway seeds and salt.
Add the lamb and turn it about with a spoon until all the pieces are evenly
coated.  Marinate the lamb at room temperature for about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the almonds and the rest of the boiling water in a bowl,
and soak for 10 minutes.  Pour the almonds and their soaking water into a
blender and blend until you have a smooth paste. Set aside. In a heavy
casserole, heat the puree over moderate heat until fairly hot. Add the
cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves; stir for a minute or so, then add the
onions, garlic and ginger. Lifting and turning them constantly, fry for 7
to 8 minutes until the onions are soft and golden brown. With a slotted
spoon, remove the lamb from the marinade, add the meat to the casserole,
and stir over moderate heat until it browns evenly. Stir in the marinade
and the cold water, then add the almond puree and red pepper and cook for
10 minutes stirring occasionally.  Pour in the coconut milk, bring to a
boil, and simmer partially covered for 20 minutes, or until the lamb is
tender.  To serve, discard the cinnamon and cloves, mound the lamb
attractively on a deep heated platter, and pour the sauce over it.
