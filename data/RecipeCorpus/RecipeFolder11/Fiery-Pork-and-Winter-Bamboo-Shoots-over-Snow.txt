Deep-frying Rice Stick:  Break up rice stick before measuring. Heat
vegetable oil in hot wok.  When oil is medium hot, test a few pieces of
rice stick: it should fry quickly to a puffy white. If it browns, turn down
the heat. Fry rice sticks in very small batches. Spread out fried snow on
serving platter, reserve in warm place.

Stir-Frying:  Clean wok; then reheat to very hot.  Add peanut oil, heating
until it just begins to smoke; add drained pork & stir-fry briskly for
about 2 minutes. Add bamboo, garlic & ginger. Toss with pork for 1 minute.
Re- stir liquids and add to wok. Cover wok, & simmer for 3 minutes. Remove
cover; turn up heat again; boil briefly to reduce sauce; sprinkle on
vinegar.  Ladle over rice stick & serve.
