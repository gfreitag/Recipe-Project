cubes, mixing well. Set aside for 30 minutes. Wipe the chicli peppers clean
with a wet towel. Remove the tops and set aside on plate with scallions
Combine the sauce ingredients in a cup. Set aside near cooking area. Place
a strainer over a pot near the cooking area. Heat a wok over moderate heat
until it is very hot. Add the peanut oil and heat to about 300. Mix the
chicken again and add to the hot oil. Raise the heat to high and stir the
chicken until it separates or until most of the chicken has changed color
but is not yet completely cooked. Pour the oil and chicken into the
strainer to drain. As soon as the oil has drained away, transfer the
chicken to a plate. Heat the same wok. Add 2 tbsp of the drained oil, brown
the chile peppers until they turn dark red, then add the scallions and the
cooked chicken and stir fry for 1 minute. Stir the sauce mixture well and
add it to the chicken while stirring over high heat until it thickens and
coats the chicken with a clear gaze. Add the peanuts and mix well. FROM:
