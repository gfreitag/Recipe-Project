Wash chicken pieces and place in large stockpot. COver with
water and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken
falls off the bones (approximately 2-3 hours). Remove chicken
with slotted spoon and let cool. When cool enough to handle,
remove bones and skin and cut all chicken up in small pieces,
being careful not to leav any bones. Add chicken to stock left
in pan and refrigerate overnight. When you remove pot from
refrigerator, skim off the grease from the top of the stock (
the chicken will be very moist from having remained in the
stock overnight). Return pot to heat and slowly bring to boil.
Add onions, celery, carrots, tomatoes, cabbage and potatoes.
Add bouillon, bay leaf, salt and pepper, marjoram, basil, thyme
and parsley and simmer until vegetables are done to your
liking. Then add broken pieces of spaghetti and cook until
tender. The soup will be very thick, almost stew-like. It
freezes well.
