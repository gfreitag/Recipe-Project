Title: Honey Grilled Pork
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Honey
1/2 c  Dijon mustard
1/4 c  Olive oil
1    Pork loin roast
6    Cloves garlic, minced
Salt & pepper, to taste
4 tb Fresh rosemary, or more
Place all ingredients (except the roast) in a blender and blend. Pierce
roast on all sides and place in a zip-lock with the marinade. Chill,
turning frequently about 12 hours. Grill one & one half hours, covered.
Start roast on a hot grill, about 15 minutes, to char outside; turn heat to
low. Baste frequently with marinade. Remove from heat, allow to rest 10
minutes, slice & serve. If you have fresh rosemary throw a couple sprigs on
the coals as you grill...smells wonderful.
