Title: Basic Cooked Rice - Prudhomme
Categories: Cajun, Rice/grains

1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Garlic powder
Pinch white pepper
Pinch black pepper
Pinch cayenne pepper
2 c  Uncooked rice (see note)
2 1/2 c  Basic stock (Prudhomme)
1 1/2 tb Onions, chopped very fine
1 1/2 tb Celery, chopped very fine
1 1/2 tb Bell peppers,chopped vy fine
1 1/2 tb Unsalted butter (preferred)
In a 5x9x2-1/2-inch loaf pan, combine all ingredients; mix well.  Seal pan
snuggly with aluminum foil.  Bake at 350F until rice is tender, about 1
hour, 10 minutes.  Serve immediately.  However, you can count on the rice
staying hot for 45 minutes and warm for 2 hours.  To reheat leftover rice,
either use a double boiler or warm the rice in a skillet with unsalted
butter. From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen
