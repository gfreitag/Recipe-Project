1987 This is easy to make. Make lots and freeze it for future use. If
you're not a fan of pounding you can use a food processor. Just don't
overdo the processing. Green Curry Paste (Nam Prik Kaeng Khiew Wah) Place
the cumin and coriander seeds in a pan, without adding any oil. Dry-fry
them, stirring, for 1-2 minutes until they are aromatic and slightly
browned. Pound them with the remaining ingredients to produce a fine paste.
