Title: Oriental Wings
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Pepper
Oil for deep frying
1 c  Teriyaki sauce
1 c  Honey
30    Chicken wings *
2    Eggs; beaten
1 c  Flour
1 ts Garlic powder
*  Tips removed and wings cut into 2 pieces. Dip the wings into the beaten
eggs and allow them to drain for a few minutes. Next dredge in flour
seasoned with the garlic powder, pepper and salt until they are fully
coated. Heat oil between 350 and 360 F., or until a drop of beaten egg
rises bubbly to the surface.  Deep fry several at a time until golden brown
and crisp. Drain on paper towels. Mix teriyaki sauce and honey. After wings
have drained, but are still hot, brush or marinade with sauce mixture. I
would recommend that you let them marinade for 5-10 minutes. Shake off
excess sauce, and serve hot. Bon Appetit! -- Della
