Wash the lentils thoroughly.  In a 2 1/2-quart saucepan bring 6 cups of
water to a boil. Add the lentils, bacon, leek or green onion, carrot and
celery.  Simmer, partially covered, for 30 to 40 minutes. Meanwhile in a
frypan, saute chopped onion in vegetable oil until soft. Sprinkle flour
over onion, and stir. Lower heat, stir constantly, and cook until the flour
turns a light brown.  DO NOT burn flour. Stir in 1/2 cup of hot lentil soup
into the browned flour; beat with a wire whisk until well-blended. Beat in
vinegar.  Add contents of frypan to lentil pan and stir together. Cover and
simmer for 30 minutes or until lentils are soft.
Add the frankfurters and catsup.  Cook to heat frankfurters through.
Season with salt and pepper and serve hot.
