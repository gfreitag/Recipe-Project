Title: Snails Sommeroise
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 lb Fatty bacon
6    Shelled walnuts, ground
4    Canned anchovy fillets
3    Garlic cloves
Salt and pepper
3 tb Flour
6 1/2 lb Whole trimmed spinach leaves
100    Snails
Vinegar
2    Thyme sprigs
1/2    Bay leaf
1    Basil sprig
1    Pared orange peel
7 oz Pork rind
1/2 c  Olive oil
Preparation time 3 hours.  Cooking time 2 1/2 hours. Starve the snails for
at least 8 days, then wash them in several changes of water until clean.
Rinse with vinegar, then drain. Place the snails in a saucepan of boiling
water with the thyme, bay leaf, basil, orange peel and pork rind. When the
snails are almost cooked, drain them and remove them from their shells. [I
guess boiling them makes it easier to remove them from their shells. --mkm]
Brown the snails in olive oil with the fatty bacon, very finely chopped [I
assume the author means chop the bacon first. --mkm], the ground walnuts,
anchovy fillets, crushed garlic and salt and pepper. Thicken the mixture
with the flour, then serve on a bed of spinach. [Make sure you wash all the
grit off the spinach first. --mkm] Rose, red or white wines: Tavel,
