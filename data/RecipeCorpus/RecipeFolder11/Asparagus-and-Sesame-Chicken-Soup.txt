Title: Asparagus and Sesame Chicken Soup
Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Soups/stews
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Warm water
1 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Button mushrooms, canned
8    Fresh asparagus spears
2 lb Chicken
3 tb Sesame oil
6    Slices ginger root
1/2 c  Medium sherry
1/2 ts Salt
Preparation:  Rinse chicken, remove fat pockets, pat dry, and chop into
bite-size pieces.  NOTE:  if tempted to use breast meat without bones,
please don`t; bones add to body and flavor of soup. Peel and slice ginger
root.  Wash and cut asparagus into 2" sections.

Braising:  Heat wok to medium hot.  Add sesame oil. Start braising chicken
a few pieces at a time when oil begins to smell. Sesame oil will burn at
lower temperature than other cooking oils, so avoid hot wok. After browning
lightly, return chicken pieces to wok; add ginger slices, sherry and salt.
When sherry boils, add water and sugar. Turn up heat, bring to boil, then
reduce heat to simmer, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add mushrooms and
asparagus, simmer for another 15 minutes.

Transfer to covered soup tureen (or put plate on top of soup bowl), place
in steamer on low, and hold until ready to serve.

You can make this soup in large sauce pan, if wok is needed for something
else.
