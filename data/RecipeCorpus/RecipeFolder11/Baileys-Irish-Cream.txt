Title: Baileys Irish Cream
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Whiskey
1 ts Coffee, powdered
1 ts Extract, vanilla
1 ts Gelatin; dissolved in
1/2 c  Water
6 oz Milk, canned
6 oz Milk, sweetened evaporated
I reduced the instant coffee to one teaspoon from three because the coffee
flavor was too overpowering and the Irish teaspoon is smaller than ours. Of
course, people that pour Baileys into coffee won't be able to tell the
difference.  I even think that chocolate might even be better.

This recipe was given to me (uncle Jack) at a private tea by an Irish lady
who owns a large department store in Dublin.
