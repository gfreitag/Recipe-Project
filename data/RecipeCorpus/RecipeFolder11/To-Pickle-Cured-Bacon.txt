Lay the sides of bacon on a board and rub lightly with fine salt. Let stand
for 48 hours.

Mix the next three ingredients thoroughly and dissolve in the water. Bring
to a boil and cook for 15 minutes. Skim and let cool. Place bacon in a
clean oak barrel and pour the liquid over the meat. Place a heavy weight on
bacon to keep it under the brine. Bacon prepared like this will keep about
one year. Have sections of bacon smoked at smoke house as needed.
