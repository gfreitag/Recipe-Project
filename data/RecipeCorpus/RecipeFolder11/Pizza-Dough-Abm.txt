Corn meal
Bring all ingredients to room temp and add to breadmaker.  Select "white
dough" cycle and press Start.

At end of cycle, remove dough and divide into halves.  Preheat oven to 450.
Roll or shape into pizzas on surface dusted with cornmeal. Add toppings of
choice and bake 15 minutes on bottom rack, to make sure crust gets done.

Sylvia's notes: I modified this from one posted on GEnie by G.GARVEY2
10/30/91, and was thoroughly delighted with the result.  The dough was easy
to work with and stretched well; I even played "Italian pizza maker" and
threw the thing into the air to stretch it.  We had company for dinner, and
when I asked for comments because I wasn't an accomplished pizza maker, one
guest responded "you are now!"
