Title: Chicken and Lotus Seed Soup
Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Soups/stews
Yield: 4 servings
5 c  Chicken stock
2    Slices fresh ginger root
2 tb Dry sherry
1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
2 ts Lotus root powder
1 c  Chicken breast, julienne
12    Dried lotus seeds
4    Nami black mushrooms
1/2 c  Celery, julienne
1 tb Smithfield ham, julienne
2    Sprigs Chinese parsley
Preparation:  Blanch lotus seeds, remove reddish brown tip. Wash and soak
mushrooms in warm water until soft, about 30 minutes; remove stems; slice
in thin matchsticks. Before slicing celery, scrap off stringy back of
stalk; slice julienne lengthwise in 1" sections. Slice chicken breast and
Smithfield ham (or other pungent pressed ham) in 1" strips.

Soup:  Heat stock in 3-quart pan or sandy pot.  Add ginger, sherry, sugar
and salt.  Bring to gentle boil, then add lotus seeds, chicken and
mushrooms.  Simmer soup for 30 minutes. Add celery and ham. Simmer for
another 15 minutes.  Mix lotus root powder with a little hot stock, then
stir into soup.  Transfer to heated serving bowl, or serve in sandy pot.
Garnish with Chinese parsley.

NOTE:  Lotus seeds require about 30 minutes in simmering water to soften.
Check them before adding ham and celery; simmer longer if necessary.
