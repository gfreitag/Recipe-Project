Title: Gooseberry Curd
Categories: Fruits, Preserve
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Unsalted butter
2    Eggs
1    Egg yolk
1 pt Gooseberries
2 tb -Water
1/2 c  Sugar
Rinse the gooseberries and put them in a non-corroding saucepan with the
water.  Cover and cook over low to medium heat, stirring occasionally, for
about 20 minutes, or until the gooseberries are very mushy.  Puree them
through a food mill or a strainer.  You should have about 1 1/4 cups of
puree.

Stir the sugar and butter into the warm puree and heat, stirring
constantly.  Whisk the eggs and the egg yolk just until mixed, then whisk
in a little of the hot gooseberry mixture to heat the eggs.  Return to the
pan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is well
thickened, and has reached a temperature of 170 F.  Pour into a container,
cover, and chill.

Use this to fill small tartlets, garnishing them with rosettes of creme de
Chantilly; or fill a 9-inch pre-baked tart shell with the curd and pipe
rosettes of creme Chantilly over the top, leaving a small spot uncovered in
the center so the curd will show.  This also makes a delicious filling for
cakes.  Like most high-acid fruit curds, this will keep at least two weeks
in the refrigerator.

Creme Chantilly: Whip the amount of cold fresh cream needed for your recipe
until it mounds softly and will just barely hold its shape.  The volume
will approximately double after it is whipped.  There should be no hint of
graininess, which is the first sign that the cream is overbeaten and
turning to butter.  Stir in vanilla and sugar to taste.  Or you may flavor
the cream with spirits or liqueurs, wine, fruit purees or jams, or the
reduced liquid from poached fruit.
