Cousin Walter and those who dined with him looked forward to this
well-chilled light beet soup on warm days.  Milk, plain yogurt, or a
combination of the two can be used instead of buttermilk.

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan.  Add the onions and celery, and saute
over medium heat for 10 minutes, or until the celery is soft and golden.
Add the celery leaves and cook for 2 minutes longer.  Add the remaining
ingredients except the buttermilk and dill.  Bring to a boil, lower the
heat and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the beets are tender. Cool. Stir
in the buttermilk and dill.  Chill thoroughly.  From: The Tabasco Cookbook.
