Here's a recipe from another New Orleans Chaine de Rotisseur award winner,
Gunter Preuss. This is by Gunter Preuss of Versailles Restaurant in New
Orleans, a favored and elegant 5 star place. Some amounts he omitted which
need to be guessed at, to taste. VEAL FRICASSE w. CAPERS & DILL

1. Cut veal in 1 inch strips, (not too lean - not too fat.)

2. Evenly cover with water and bring to slow boil. Rinse clean.

3. Cover veal with water, season with salt, white wine, onion, bay leaves,
cloves, simmer until cooked.

4. Make a white roux and use strained stock for sauce. Cook until flour
taste is gone.

5. Add capers, dill, pepper and nutmeg. Adjust seasoning to taste.

6. Add cooked veal to sauce and simmer 10 more minutes.

7. Before serving, mix cream and egg yolks and pour very slowly into
Fricasse.

Serve with rice or noodles.
