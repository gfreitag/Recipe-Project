Title: Spam Salad Cones
Categories: Misc.
Yield: 5 servings
2 tb Pickle relish
1 ts Mustard
5    8" flour tortillas
5    Lettuce leaves
1 cn 12 oz cubed SPAM
1 c  Chopped celery
1/3 c  Mayonnaise
1/4 c  Toasted slivered almonds
2 tb Chopped onion
In a medium bowl, mix all ingredients except tortillas and lettuce. Cover;
refrigerate until ready to serve.

Roll each tortilla into a large cone and secure with a toothpick. Carefully
stuff each cone with a crumpled piece of foil so cone will retain its
shape. Place cones on a baking sheet; broil 3" from heat turning several
times until cones are crisp and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Cool;
carefully remove foil and wooden picks.

When ready to serve, line each cone with a lettuce leaf and fill with salad
mixture.
