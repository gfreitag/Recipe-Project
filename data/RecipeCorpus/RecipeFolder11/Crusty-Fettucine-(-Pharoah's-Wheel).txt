Taglioni Colla Crocia (Ruota di Faraone)

To quote the author, "Tagliolini colla Crocia" is traditionally served on
Shabbat B'shallach in all parts of Italy and is associated by Italian Jews
with the passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea and their
deliverance from the Egyptians although the preparation of it, and even the
name, varies from place to place."

*Anne's note: Butter or margarine may be substituted for the chicken fat as
it is used to grease a dish.

Roll out the dough not too thin and fold as you would for a jelly roll, 2
1/2" wide. Cut 1/6" wide slices and toss to unfold noodles.
Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil. Add tagliolini and salt; when boiling
resumes, cook 1 minute.
Drain, and place in a large bowl with meat sauce and diced cold cuts. Toss
quickly to distribute the dressing evenly.
Place in a round oven proof baking dish, well greased with fat.* If using
raisins and nuts, make layers, alternating pasta with a mixture of raisins
and nuts. Bake in 350F oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or till a nice crust is
formed on all sides. Invert over a serving dish and bring to the table.
