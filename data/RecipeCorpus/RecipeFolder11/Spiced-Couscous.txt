Title: Spiced Couscous
Categories: Rice/grains, Misc.
Yield: 6 servings
2 1/4 c  Chicken stock
1/2 c  Currants
1 1/2 c  Couscous
1/4 c  Cashews; or pistachios
1/4 c  Butter
1/4 ts Cinnamon, ground
1/4 ts Cardamom, ground
1/8 ts Cloves, ground
Toast and chop cashews or pistachios.  Melt butter in medium saucepan over
low heat.  Add spices and cook 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add stock
and currants.  Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Bring to boil. Mix in
couscous.  Cover and remove from heat.  Let stand 5 minutes. Fluff with
fork. Transfer couscous to bowl, add nuts and toss well.

Sylvia's comments: this was good!  I was hesitant to try it because I'd
never heard of couscous and the spices sounded weird, but it was delicious
with just a hint of sweetness.  I don't think that much butter was needed,
though (and I'd already cut it down!), will try less next time.
