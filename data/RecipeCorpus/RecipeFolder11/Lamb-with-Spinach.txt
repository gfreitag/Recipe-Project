Title: Lamb with Spinach
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Cubed lamb
2 ts Ground cumin seeds
1 ts Coriander seeds
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
2 ts Salt
5 tb Plain yogurt well beaten
2 lb Fresh spinach chopped
1/4 ts Garam masala
8 tb Vegetable oil
1/4 ts Black peppercorns
6    Whole cloves
2    Bay leaves
6    Cardamom pods
2    Medium onions finely chopped
6    Garlic cloves chopped
1    Inch cube of ginger chopped
Heat the oil in a large pot over a medium-high flame.
When hot, put in the  peppercorns,  cloves,  bay leaves, and cardamom
pods.   Stir for a second.  Now put in the onions, garlic and ginger. Stir
and fry until the onions develop brown specks. Now add the meat, ground
cumin, ground coriander,  cayenne pepper, and 1q/2 of the salt. Stir and
fry for  a minute.
Add  1 tablespoon of the yogurt.   Stir and fry for a minute. Keep doing
this until all yogurt has been incorporated. The meat should also have a
slightly browned look. Add the spinach and the remaining salt. Stir to mix.
Keep stirring and cooking until the spinach wilts completely. Cover tightly
and simmer on low heat for about 1 hour or until meat is tender. Remove the
lid and add the garam masala. Turn the heat to medium. Stir and cook
another 5 minutes until most of the water in the spinach disappears and you
have a thick, green sauce. Remove the whole spices and serve.
