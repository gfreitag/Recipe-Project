Contributed to the echo by: Sue Sanna Here's the Ricotta Torta Recipe:
recipe for 2 crust pie Beat eggs until light and add 1/2 t. salt and 1 c.
Powdered sugar, adding one tablespoon at a time and continuing to beat
uniterruptedly. This is best done in an electric blender. Add 3 T.
cornstarch, beating until the mixture is smooth and thick.

Force the ricotta cheese through a fine sieve. Combine with softened cream
cheese and beat in 1/2 c. half and half, adding this cheese mixture to egg
mixture while beating continuously. The success of this torta lies in the
thorough beating. Flavor with 1 T. brandy or rum. Mix thoroughly, then fold
in 1/2 c. chopped assorted candied fruit. Pour into pie shell.

Cover with second pie pastry and flute. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour.
Turn off the heat and allow the cake to remain in the oven with the door
closed for 3/4 of an hour. Let cool, but DO NOT REFRIGERATE before serving.
Decorate the top with candied fruit, and powdered sugar.
