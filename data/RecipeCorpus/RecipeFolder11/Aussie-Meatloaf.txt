First Prize LOAF: Combine meats, breadcrumbs, onions, salt, pepper, garlic,
parsley, curry and egg in large bowl. Mix well. Mix milk and water and add
to meat mixture a little at a time until smooth but firm. Shape into loaf
and put into greased baking pan. Bake 30 minutes at 375F.

SAUCE: Saute onions in margarine until golden and add all other
ingredients. Bring slowly to a boil, lower heat and simmer 10 to 15
minutes. (great with ribs or chicken). After loaf has cooked for 30
minutes, pour half of the sauce over the meat, return to oven and bake 45
minutes more, basting often with remaining sauce. Serve loaf hot in thick
slices with remaining sauce. Also makes great sandwiches.
