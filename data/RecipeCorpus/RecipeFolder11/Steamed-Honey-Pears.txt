Title: Steamed Honey Pears
Categories: Chinese, Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
4 ts Minced preserved jujubes
(Chinese dates)
4    Fresh Bartlett pears
4 tb Orange honey
Preparation:  Wash pears.  Carefully slice off the tip quarter, leaving the
stem intact.  Core each pear through to the bottom. Make four lengthwise
cuts from the core outward but not through the skin. If you have peeled the
pears, do not make these cuts. Place pears in individual bowls, such as
rice bowls or dessert dishes. Pack core with minced dates, add 1 tablespoon
of orange honey to each pear. Replace top quarter. Hold at room temperature
until ready to steam.

Steaming:  In steamer, bring water to boil.  Place pears in their
individual bowls on steaming tray. Steam pears for about 30 minutes,
checking frequently to see they don't overcook and become mushy. Remove
tray from steamer. Allow pears to cool for about 30 minutes. Serve at room
temperature.
