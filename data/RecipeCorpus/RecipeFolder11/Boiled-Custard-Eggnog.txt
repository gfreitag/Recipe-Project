Title: Boiled Custard Eggnog
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Cream, light
1/2 ts Extract, vanilla
1/16 ts Nutmeg, ground
3/4 c  Whiskey; optional
3/4 c  Sugar
1/8 c  Flour
1/16 ts Salt
4 ea Egg yolks
3 c  Milk
Mix sugar, flour, and salt in heavy 6-qt saucepan. Add egg yolks and mix
well.  Using wire whisk, stir egg mixture and slowly pour in milk and
cream.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until custard is thickened
and just coats the back of a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and let cool.
The custard will thicken as it cools. When cold, stir in vanilla, nutmeg,
and whiskey.

Sylvia's notes: This is another of those recipes that are written for chefs
with dozens of apprentices floating around to do the tedious work. Stir
constantly over low heat, indeed!  I used medium-high heat, and it STILL
took 25 minutes of stirring constantly.  It is a nice thick eggnog, but I'm
not wild about the subtle but detectable floury taste. I'll hold onto this
until I have a tested eggnog recipe that I like better, and then it'll be
history.
