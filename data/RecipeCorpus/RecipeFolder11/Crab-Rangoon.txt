Taken from a restaurant recipe printed in Gourmet some years ago. Combine
crabmeat with cream cheese and seasonings in a medium bowl and blend to a
paste. Place heaping teaspoonful on each wonton. Moisten edges of wontons
with egg yolk. Gather the four corners of the wontons together at the top
and pinch the edges together to seal. Heat oil to 375 deg. Add wontons in
batches and fry until golden brown; about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted
spoon and drain on paper towels. Serve hot with Chinese mustard and red
sauce for dipping.
