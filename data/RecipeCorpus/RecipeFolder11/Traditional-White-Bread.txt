Categories: Rice/grains
Yield: 32 servings
2 pk Regular or quick-acting

Practice is the key to kneading and shaping yeast breads. Mix 3-1/2 cups of
the flour,  the sugar, salt, shortening and yeast in large bowl. Add warm
water. Beat on low speed 1 minute, scraping bowl frequently. Beat on medium
speed 1 minute, scraping bowl frequently. Stir in remaining flour, 1 cup at
a time, to make dough easy to handle.  Turn dough onto lightly floured
surface. Knead about 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Place in
greased bowl and turn greased side up. Cover and let rise in warm place 40
to 60 minutes or until double. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when
touched.)Grease 2 loaf pans,  9 X 5 X 3 or 8-1/2 X 4-1/2 X 2-1/2 inches.
Punch down dough and divide in half. Flatten dough for each loaf with hand
or rolling pin into a rectangle, 18 X 9 inches. Fold crosswise into thirds,
overlappin the two sides. Flatten or roll into square, 9 X 9 inches. Roll
dough tightly, beginning at one of the open (unfolded) ends, to form a
loaf. Press with thumbs to seal after each turn. Pinch edge firmly to seal.
Press each end with side of hand to seal. Fold ends under loaf. Place seam
side down in pan. Brush loaves lightly with margarine. Cover and let rise
in warm place 35 to 50 minutes or until double.Place oven rack in low
position so that tops of pans will be in center of oven. Heat oven to 425
degrees. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until loaves are deep golden brown and
sound hollow when tapped; remove from pans. Brush loaves with margarine if
desired. Cool on wire rack.  2  LOAVES (16 SLICES EACH); 105 CALORIES PER
