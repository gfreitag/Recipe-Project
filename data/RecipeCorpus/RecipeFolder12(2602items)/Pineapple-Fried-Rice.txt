Title: Pineapple Fried Rice
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Cooked longgrain rice, such
As jasmine, chilled
3 tb Vegetable oil
1 sm Onion, finely diced
5    Cloves garlic, chopped
1 tb Grated fresh ginger
1 c  Blanched, sliced Chinese
Long beans
1/2 c  Seeded, diced tomatoes
1 c  Finely chopped fresh
Pineapple
3 tb Thai fish sauce
1 ts Sugar
3    Green onions, thinly sliced
Diagonally
If serving rice in fresh pineapple, halve the pineapple lengthwise,
leaving the leafy top intact and cutting through it. Hollow out each
half, reserving 1 cup of the fruit for the rice and extra for
garnishing. Save remaining pineapple for another use. Make a small
slice on the outside of each half to create a flat base to hold the
pineapple steady. Set aside.

Crumble the cold rice between your fingers to separate the grains,
and set aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a wok or large skillet, swirling to
coat the pan. Add the onion and toss until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add
the garlic and toss until fragrant and soft, about 1 to 2 minutes.
Add the ginger and toss for another minute.

Add the remaining tablespoon of oil, then add the rice. Fry for 2 to 3
minutes over high heat, then add the beans, tomatoes, and pineapple,
and fry 2 to 3 minutes more. Add the fish sauce and sugar, and toss
until ingredients are well combined and rice is heated thoroughly,
about 5 minutes. Add the green onions and toss to combine. Remove
from the heat and transfer to a serving platter, or if using fresh
pineapple, fill each half of prepared pineapple with warm rice and
garnish with extra chunks of pineapple.
