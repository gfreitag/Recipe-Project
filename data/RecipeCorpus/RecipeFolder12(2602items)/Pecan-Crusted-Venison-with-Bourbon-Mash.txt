Title: Pecan Crusted Venison with Bourbon Mash
Categories: Meats, Emeril, World, Game
Yield: 4 Servings
12    Venison medallions (3 oz ea)
2 c  Roasted pecans
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
2 tb Essence
2/3 c  Creole mustard
Olive oil for sauteing
6    Whole sweet potatoes;
-roasted, skin left on, warm
1/4 c  Heavy cream
1/4 c  Bourbon
2 tb Butter
Salt and pepper
Fried sweet potato nests
2 tb Chives; chopped
2 tb Brunoise red peppers
2 tb Brunoise yellow peppers
For the venison:  In a food processor, pulse the pecans until they are
coarse and are still textured. (Do not puree the pecans because the
crust will be too wet) Add the bread crumbs and Essence. Season each
medallion with salt and pepper.  Rub each medallion with the Creole
mustard, coating each side completely. Crust each medallion with the
pecan crust. (Every inch of the medallion needs to be crusted
completely). For the mash: The potatoes should be roasted for 40
minutes at 425 degrees. Remove skin from the roasted sweet potatoes
and place in a sauce pot. Over low heat, partially mash the sweet
potatoes.  Add the cream, bourbon and butter, continue to mash until
all the ingredients are incorporated and the potatoes are smooth but
with small lumps. Season with salt and pepper. To finish the venison:
In a sauce pan, heat the olive oil. When the oil is smoking hot, add
the venison. Saute for 3 minutes for medium rare on each side.
