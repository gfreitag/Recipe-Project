Oil for frying
1 tb Olive oil
1 lb Lean ground beef
1 c  Minced onions
Salt and cayenne
1 tb Chili powder
1 ts Cumin
1 tb Minced garlic
1 c  Veal stock
1/4 lb Grated Cheddar cheese (about

Preheat the fryer. When the oil is hot, fry the tortillas in batches,
until crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove the
chips from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the chips
with Essence. In a large saute pan, heat the oil. When the oil is
hot, add the ground beef, stirring constantly. Season the beef with
Essence. Brown the beef with 2 minutes. Add the onions and continue
to brown for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the chili powder, cumin, and

garlic. Add the stock and bring the liquid to a simmer. Simmer for 2
to 3 minutes, or until the liquid reduces by 1/4. Remove the pan from
the heat. Lay the chips on a large platter. Spoon the beef mixture
over the chips. Sprinkle the meat with the two cheeses. Top the
cheese with the lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and jalapenos. Garnish
the nachos with the cilantro.
