Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 sm Bunch fresh cilantro
1/2 bn Fresh parsley
3    Garlic cloves
1    Piece fresh ginger, about
1    Inch long, peeled
12 c  Chicken stock
3 lb Baby back ribs
2/3 c  Hoisin sauce
2 tb Miso
1 tb Minced fresh ginger
1 tb Chopped garlic
1 tb Sake
1 tb Soy sauce
2 ts Honey
2 ts Chili paste with garlic
1 c  Blanched black beans
1 tb Julienned cilantro leaves
Preheat the grill. Preheat the fryer. In a food processor with a metal
blade, pulse the first four ingredients together. Transfer the
mixture to a large Dutch oven. Add the stock and ribs and bring to a
boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the
ribs are tender. In a mixing bowl, whisk the remaining ingredients
together. Drain the ribs and transfer the ribs to a parchment lined
baking sheet. Brush the ribs with the sauce and let the ribs cool for
1 hour. Brush the ribs a second time and place on the grill. Cook the
ribs until deep brown, about 4 minutes per side. Cut the rack into
individual ribs and serve with the remaining sauce. Fry the blanched
black beans until crispy, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the oil
and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season with salt and pepper. To
assemble, arrange the ribs on a platter. Garnish with the beans and
chopped cilantro.
