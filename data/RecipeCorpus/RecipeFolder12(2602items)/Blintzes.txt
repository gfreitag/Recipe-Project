Title: Blintzes
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Whole milk
4 lg Eggs lightly beaten
1 c  All purpose flour
1 ts Salt
With a whisk, beat eggs and milk together and add the salt.
Gradually, a tablespoonful at a time, whisk in flour and beat until
smooth. Heat a 6inch skillet and butter it lightly.  Pour in enough
batter to make a thin pancake.  (If batter is too thick, add water to
thin) Pour out excess back into the batter and don't worry if a "tab"
forms on the side of the pan.

Cook the blintz on one side only until the top blisters and it looks
dry around the edges.  Turn the blintz upside down onto a clean
towel. Rebutter the skillet if need be, every 2 or 3 blintzes, and
proceed until all the batter has been used up.

Make assorted fillings, roll up and fry, or bake or freeze for
another day.

Yield: about 1 1/2 dozen
