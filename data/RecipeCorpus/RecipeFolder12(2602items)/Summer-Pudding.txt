Title: Summer Pudding
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 lb Raspberries
1    (12-ounce) jar red currant
Jelly
1    Loaf high quality unsliced
White bread
Place the currant jelly in a large saucepan over medium heat and
bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Add the raspberries and
return to a boil. Remove the crust from the bread and slice thinly.
Or use very thin sliced bread. Line a shallow ring mold with the
bread, cutting it to fit and over lapping the pieces of bread only
very slightly. Remove the raspberries from the syrup with a slotted
spoon and fill the lined mold. Add enough of the syrup to just fill
the mold. Reserve any leftover syrup. Cover the filling with more
bread, pressing it down firmly. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate
overnight if possible. Invert a platter on the mold and invert the
mold on the platter. Lift off the mold. Nap the outside of the
pudding with any leftover syrup.
