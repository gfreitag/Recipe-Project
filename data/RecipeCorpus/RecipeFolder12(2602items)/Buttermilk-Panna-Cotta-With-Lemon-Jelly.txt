Title: Buttermilk Panna Cotta With Lemon Jelly
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
For panna cotta-
2 c  Buttermilk
1 1/2 ts Powdered unflavored gelatin
2/3 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Sugar
For jelly:
1/2 c  Fresh lemon juice
1/2 pk Powdered unflavored gelatin
1/4 c  Sugar
Make panna cotta:

Pour 1 cup of buttermilk into the top of a double boiler (not over
heat). Sprinkle gelatin over the buttermilk, let stand to soften,
about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, bring cream and scant 1/2 cup sugar
to a boil. Add cream mixture to the gelatin mixture; place over
simmering water; whisk until the gelatin dissolves, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the remaining cup of buttermilk. Pass the mixture through a
cheesecloth-lined strainer. Divide among six 4-ounce ramekins or
small bowls on a baking sheet. Cover; refrigerate until set, about 4
hours.

Make jelly:

Place 1/4 cup of the lemon juice in a mixing bowl. Sprinkle the
gelatin over the lemon juice and let stand to soften, about 5 minutes.

In a small pan bring the sugar and 1 cup of water to a boil over high
heat. Pour the syrup over the gelatin mixture, whisk to dissolve. Add
the remaining 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Allow the mixture to return to
room temperature.

Once the buttermilk panna cotta has set, pour a 1/4-inch-thin layer of
lemon jelly on top of each ramekin. Refrigerate until set, about 30
minutes. The panna cotta ramekins can be prepared up to 24 hours in
advance, covered and refrigerated. Serve chilled and garnish with
lemon sorbet and crispy cookies.
