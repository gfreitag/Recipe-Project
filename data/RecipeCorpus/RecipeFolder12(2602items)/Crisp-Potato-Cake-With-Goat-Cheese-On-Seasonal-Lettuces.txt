Title: Crisp Potato Cake With Goat Cheese On Seasonal Lettuces
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
Vinaigrette (recipe
Follows)
2    Peeled Idaho potatoes
1 tb Finely chopped chives
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper
4 oz Goat cheese
4 c  Loosely packed mixed baby
Lettuces
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
Slice the potatoes into very thin, fine julienne style strips,
approximately 1 1/2 to 2 inches long by 1/16-inch. Do not wash or put
the potatoes in water because it would remove the starch which is
needed to keep the potatoes together. Squeeze all the moisture from
the cut potatoes and season with salt and pepper.

Add the tablespoon of olive oil to a large skillet. Lay out a thin
layer of potato, forming a circle (2 1/2-inch diameter). Spread one
ounce of the goat cheese on the mound of potato, sprinkle with finely
chopped chives. Cover the goat cheese with another thin layer of
potato, making sure that the goat cheese is completely enclosed.
Repeat the same operation, making a total of 4 pancakes.

Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the large skillet and
over medium heat, let the potato turn into a golden crust on one
side. Carefully turn the potato pancakes over and cook to a golden
brown on the other side.

Toss the baby lettuces with the vinaigrette. Arrange the lettuces
attractively in the center of each of the 4 plates and top each salad
with a potato and goat cheese pancake.
