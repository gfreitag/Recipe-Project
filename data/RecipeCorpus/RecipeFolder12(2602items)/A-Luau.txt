The idea of building a pit to cook is as old as time. What you cook
can be as complicated or as easy as you want, and its size can be
whatever the labor force allows--a much better usage for bob a job
week than ruining the paintwork on your car. Suggestions for food to
cook are ears of corn, potatoes, fish fillets wrapped in foil with
butter and seasoning, chops or sausages wrapped in foil, clams,
mussels, or lobsters. Use your imagination and experiment.

1. Drive 4 posts into the ground to delineate a rectangular area
about 5 by 8 feet. Dig out to a depth of 18 inches, banking the sand
around the edges.

2. Line the pit with smooth, dry pebbles or bricks.

3. Start a small fire on top of the stones in the middle and
gradually add logs until you fill the whole pit.

4. Keep the fire stoked for at least an hour, then allow to burn down
for another hour to ensure the stones are properly heated.

5. Carefully rake the embers from the pit without disturbing the
stones.

6. As quickly as possible, spread well-rinsed seaweed or non-poisonous
green leaves over the stones in a layer about 6 inches deep.

7. Lay the prepared food in a single layer on top of the seaweed.

8. Spread a 6 inch layer of seaweed over the food. Make sure the food
is completely covered.

9. Cover with a tarp that extends at least 12 inches beyond the sides
of the pit. Weigh down the edges with stones. Let the food cook for
at least 3 hours.
