Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 sl Bacon
1    Onion, chopped
5    6 pounds fresh turnip
Greens
1 1/2 c  Water
2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
In a heavy skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until crisp,
about 6 minutes. Remove from heat and drain well on paper towels.
Remove all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the skillet. Add the onion to
the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5
minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.

Wash turnip greens thoroughly, dry well, and remove stems. Tear
greens into salad-like pieces and place in a large pot along with the
water, sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat
to low, and simmer until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Break the bacon into pieces. Remove the greens from the heat, stir in
the bacon and onions, and serve at once.
