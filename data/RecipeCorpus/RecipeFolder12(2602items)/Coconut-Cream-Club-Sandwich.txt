For cocounut custard: In a stainless steel sauce pan heat milk with
coconut cream and vanilla bean until scalded. Meanwhile, whip yolks
with sugar until very light and fluffy. On low speed mix in
cornstarch. Gradually pour in hot milk infusion while mixing. Strain
through a fine strainer back into the sauce pan and cook on high
heat, whisking constantly until thickened and no starchy flavor is
detected. Pour into a bowl and stir in butter. Place over an ice
water bath and whisk constantly to chill. Fold in whipped cream. Keep
chilled. For phyllo: Lay one sheet of phyllo on a parchment paper
lined sheet pan. Brush with clarified butter, sprinkle with sugar and
1/4 cup toasted coconut. Repeat the process with the second and third
sheets, omitting the coconut on top. Cut into 3- inch equilateral
triangles. Place a sheet of parchment on top and weight it down with
a heavy sheet pan small enough to fit inside of the other one. Bake
at 350 degrees in a conventional oven checking until lightly golden
brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool and break apart triangles.

To serve: Stack phyllo, then coconut custard. Repeat, then top off
with a piece of phylo. Serve garnished with Cranberry Compote, Glossy
Chocolate Sauce and a mint sprig.
