Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Sugar
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Unsweetened cocoa
1 c  Vegetable shortening
1 ts Salt
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
2    Eggs, room temperature
1 c  Milk, room temperature
1 ts Almond extract
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Hot, strong coffee
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Grease the sides and bottom of two
9-inch pans with shortening, then dust with flour.  In a large mixing
bowl, combine all ingredients except the coffee.  Mix at slow speed
until blended, scraping the sides occasionally with a rubber spatula.
Slowly add the coffee while mixing on low.  Mix for about 1 minute,
or until smooth. Do not overbeat.  Place in the prepared pans. Bake
for about 45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center
comes out clean. Cool in the pans on wire racks for about 20 minutes,
then invert onto racks and remove pans. Cool completely.

Yield: 6 cups of batter, enough to serve 20
