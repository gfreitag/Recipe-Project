Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
4    Rectangles of puff pastry,
ea 2 1/2 by 6 inches
1    Egg beaten with 1 teaspoon
Water
8 tb Butter
3    Shallots, minced
1    Onion, finely chopped
2    Granny Smith apples, peeled,
Cored, quartered and cut
Into 1/2-inch
Slices
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
4    Chicken breast halves,

Split in half
Horizontally
1 lb Fresh spinach, stemmed and
Rinsed
1 tb White wine or Champagne
Vinegar
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place puff pastry rectangles on a
baking sheet lined with parchment. Brush surface of each piece with
beaten egg without letting egg drip down sides of pastry. Bake for 10
minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees and bake 25 minutes longer or
until pastry is nut brown and crisp to the touch.

Meanwhile melt 6 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Saute
shallots for a minute. Add onion and saute 5 to 6 minutes longer or
until tender. Add apples and cook for 15 minutes or until very
tender. Season well with salt and pepper; set aside until later.

Remove pastry from the oven. Split each piece in half by carefully
pulling the top piece off the bottom with your fingers. Do this with
a light touch or the fragile pastry will break apart. Season each
piece of chicken with salt and pepper.

Melt remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a 12-inch skillet. Saute
chicken over fairly high heat for 3 minutes a side. Remove pan from
the heat.

Quickly reheat the apples. When hot, add the spinach and heat just
until wilted. Season with the vinegar, salt and pepper.

Place bottom half of pastry on a dinner plate. Top with chicken and
spoon spinach and apple mixture, with juice over the top. Lay top
piece of pastry, slightly askew across the spinach. Serve immediately.
