Crown roast of pork
Cornbread Hominy Stuffing
(see recipe)
5 c  Chicken stock
2    Dried Ancho chilies, toasted
2 tb Vegetable oil
1    Onion, finely chopped
2 tb All purpose flour
1 tb Honey
Crush fennel seeds, cumin seeds, salt, garlic, allspice, thyme and
peppercorns in mortar and pestle.  Fold double thick layer of foil
into 4 inch square.  Poke 4 small holes in foil.  Push foil through
roast to bottom to cover opening so stuffing will not fall out later
(holes let steam escape).  Place roast on rack in large roasting pan.
Rub spice mixture over meat.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Place pork in oven and reduce oven
temperature to 325 degrees F. Roast pork 1 hour 30 minutes.  Fill
cavity with enough stuffing to mound in center.  Continue roasting
until thermometer inserted into center of meat registers 160 degrees
F, about 1 hour 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, boil chicken stock until reduced by half.  Remove from
heat. Add chilies.  Cover and let stand until chilies are softened.
Puree mixture in processor.

Carefully transfer pork to platter.  Add oil to roasting pan and set
over medium heat.  Add onions and stir until onion is tender.  Add
flour and stir until golden brown.  Gradually add stock, whisk until
blended. Boil until thickened to gravy consistency.  Stir in honey.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
