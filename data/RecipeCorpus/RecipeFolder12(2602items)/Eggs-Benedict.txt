Preheat oven to 375 F. Brush slices of Brioche with butter, arrange
on a baking sheet and bake in oven until lightly golden.

Heat a grill pan over moderate heat until hot. Add bacon and cook for
2 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned.

In an egg poacher filled with simmering water, add the eggs and
simmer them until cooked to taste.

Make the sauce: In a saucepan combine the wine, vinegar and shallots
and simmer the mixture over moderately high heat until reduced to 2
tablespoons. Add the egg yolks and water and whisk until thick enough
to see bottom of pan between strokes. Add butter and whisk until
melted. Slowly add melted butter, a tablespoon at a time, removing
pan from heat from time to time to prevent curdling, and continue to
add butter until sauce is smooth and creamy. Season with salt, pepper
and stir in fresh herbs.

To assemble: Arrange two slices of bread on each of four serving
plates, top with bacon and egg and nap with sauce. Garnish with fresh
herbs.

Yield: 4 servings.
