Title: Lemon Curd Tartlettes
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
2 lg Eggs
1/2 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Fresh lemon juice
1/2    Grated lemon rind
2 tb Unsalted butter, cut up
3    Sheets phyllo
1/2 c  Butter, clarified
1/2    3/4 cup sugar
2    Egg whites
3 tb Brown sugar
For curd: Whip eggs and sugar until very light and fluffy with a whip
attachment. Gradually mix in lemon juice and rind. Place over boiling
water and cook, whisking until extremely thick, about 5 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and whisk in butter. Pour into a container, cover
with plastic wrap and chill overnight to stiffen.

For tart dough: Lay one sheet of phyllo on work surface. Brush with
clarified butter and sprinkle with sugar. Repeat the process with the
second and third sheets. Cut into 3-inch squares.

Lay 18 tartlette molds upside down on a sheet pan. Lay 1 square of
phyllo over each pan, then place a second one on top of phyllo to
help form tartlette shells. The square corners will spread out flat
on the sheet pan. Bake in this upside down position weighted down
with another sheet pan at 375 degrees Fahrenheit until golden brown.
Let phyllo cool slightly, but while still warm remove from molds.
Cool completely then fill with lemon curd by piping with a plain tip.

For meringue: Whip egg whites until stiff but not dry then add the
brown sugar gradually and continue whipping until stiff. Pipe onto
lemon curd with a star tip and brown with a blow torch or under the
broiler.
