Title: Plum Pot Pies
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 c  Plus 2 tablespoons sugar
2 tb Cornstarch
1 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
1/4 ts Plus 3/4 teaspoon ground
Ginger
1/4 ts Cinnamon
2 lb Red or black plums, pitted
And sliced 3/8-inch thick (6
Cups)
Biscuit Dough (previous
Recipe), patted into any
Shape
1 tb Unsalted butter, melted
Garnish:
Vanilla ice cream, or
Whipped cream
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk together 3/4 cup
of the sugar, the cornstarch, tapioca, 1/4 teaspoon of the ginger and
the cinnamon. Add the plum slices and toss gently to coat. Lightly
butter the inside rim of six 1 1/2-cup ovenproof ramekins or baking
cups. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and
3/4 teaspoon ginger. On a floured surface, roll out the Biscuit Dough
1/8-inch thick, lightly flouring the dough if necessary. Using a
round cutter that is 1/2-inch larger than the ramekins, cut out 6
rounds. Cut small decorative shapes from the dough scraps for
appliques if desired.

Stir the plums and spoon them and their juice evenly into the
ramekins; they should be about three quarters full. Place a round of
dough over each ramekin, tucking the excess inside the rim. Press the
dough gently to adhere to the rim. Brush the top of the dough with
the melted butter.

If using , affix the appliques on the top and brush them with butter.
Sprinkle the top of each pie with about 1 teaspoon of the
ginger-sugar. Using the tip of a sharp knife, slice a few vents in
the dough. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet, making sure they
don't touch one another. Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the
temperature to 350 degrees and bake for 15 minutes longer, or until
the tops are nicely browned and the filling is bubbling. Transfer the
ramekins to a rack to cool for 30 minutes. Serve warm with ice cream
or whipped cream.
