Potatoes
1 c  Milk
1 1/2 tb Lard
1 1/2 tb Unsalted butter

reserved cooking liquid.  Combine liquids and potato with lard,
butter, salt, and sugar in small bowl.  Set aside to cool to room
temperature. Meanwhile, combine yeast and warm water, and set aside
until foamy. When potato mixture has cooled, add yeast mixture. Add
flour and knead with a dough hook, on an electric mixer, until smooth
and glossy, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a buttered bowl, cover with
plastic wrap, and set aside in warm place to rise about 1/2 hour.
Punch dough down and briefly knead. Butter a 9 by 5 by 3inch loaf
pan.  Place dough in pan, cover with plastic, and let rise until
doubled, about 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake 30 minutes, until bread sounds
hollow when tapped.
