Title: Breton Apple Tart
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
Apple filling:
2 lb Golden Delicious apples
1/2 c  Sugar
3 tb Butter
1 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Cinnamon
2 tb Dark rum
Breton Dough:
2    Sticks butter
1 c  Sugar
1 tb Dark rum
1 ts Vanilla extract
4    Egg yolks
2 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
Egg wash:
1    Egg well beaten with a pinch
Salt
Butter and line with parchment paper a 10 by 2-inch deep layer pan.
Set a rack in the lowest level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

For the apple filling, peel, core and slice the apples into a large
saucepan. Add the remaining ingredients and cook the apples covered
until they exude their juices. Uncover the apples, lower the heat and
allow juices to evaporate. Cool the filling.

For the dough, beat the butter until soft and beat in the sugar in a
stream. Continue beating until the mixture lightens. Beat in the rum
and vanilla, then the yolks, one at a time, beating until the mixture
is very smooth and light. Beat in the flour until it is absorbed,
without over mixing. Set the paste aside, covered.

Place half the dough in the bottom of the prepared pan. Press the
dough with the fingertips evenly over the bottom of the pan and about
1 inch up the sides of the pan. Spread the cooled filling on the
dough. Flour the remaining dough and press it into a 10-inch disk on
a cardboard or tart pan bottom. Slide the dough over the filling and
press it into place making sure that the sides are straight and even.
Brush the top of the Breton with the egg wash and trace a lattice
pattern on it with the tines of a fork. Bake for about 40 to 45
minutes, or until well colored and firm. Cool on a rack in the pan
for 20 minutes, then unmold and cool completely.

Yield: one 10-inch tart
