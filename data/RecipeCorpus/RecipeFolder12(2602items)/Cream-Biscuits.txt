Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  All purpose flour
1 tb Double acting baking powder
3 tb Sugar, if desired
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/4 c  Heavy cream
Milk for brushing tops of
Biscuits
Into a bowl sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt,
add the cream, and stir the mixture until it just forms a dough.
Gather the dough into a ball, knead it gently 6 times on a lightly
floured surface, and roll or pat it out 1/2-inch thick. Cut out as
many rounds as possible with a 2 1/2-inch round cutter dipped in
flour and transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet. Gather the
scraps, reroll the dough, and cut out more rounds in the same manner
until they are 10 in all. Brush the tops of the rounds with the milk
and bake the biscuits in a preheated 425 preheated oven for 15
minutes, or until they are pale golden. Transfer the biscuits to a
rack and let them cool for 5 minutes.

Yield: 10 biscuits
