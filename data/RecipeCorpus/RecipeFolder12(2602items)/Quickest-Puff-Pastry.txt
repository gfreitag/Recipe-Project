Title: Quickest Puff Pastry
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
10 oz (2 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted
Butter
1/2 c  Cold tap water
1 ts Salt
2 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
Flour
Cut 8 ounces butter into 1/2 to 1/4-inch dice, place on a plate and
refrigerate while preparing remaining ingredients.

Measure water and add salt; stir to dissolve and set aside.

Coarsely dice remaining 4 tablespoons butter. Place flour in work
bowl of food processor fitted with metal blade; add 4 tablespoons
butter and pulse until butter is absorbed - about ten to twelve
1-second pulses. Add remaining butter and pulse one or twice to
distribute. Add water and pulse 3 or 4 times, just until dough forms
a rough ball - do not over process.

Flour work surface and scrape dough from work bowl. Shape dough into a
rough rectangle and place between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Press
dough with rolling pin to flatten, then roll back and forth several
times with rolling pin to make a 12 by 18-inch rectangle of dough.
Peel away plastic wrap and invert dough to floured work surface. Peel
away second piece of wrap. Fold dough in thirds in the width, folding
the top third down and the bottom third up, to make a 6 by 18-inch
rectangle, then roll up the dough from one of the 6-inch ends, making
sure to roll end under dough. Press the dough into a square, wrap in
plastic and refrigerate 1 hour, or until firm.

Yield: 1 1/2 pounds of dough
