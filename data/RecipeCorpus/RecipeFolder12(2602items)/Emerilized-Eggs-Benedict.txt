Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
4    English muffins, split in
Half
4 tb Butter, at room temperature
4    (6-ounce )beef fillets,
Split in half
2 tb Olive oil
Essence
3 c  Water
1/2 ts White vinegar
Salt
8    Eggs, individually cracked
Into a cup
4    Egg yolks
2 ts Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Water
1 tb Creole Mustard
2 ts Finely chopped parsley
1/2 lb Butter, melted and warm
Preheat the griddle.  Brush the muffins with the butter.  Place the
muffins on the hot griddle and pan-fry for 2 minutes on each side.
Remove the muffins from the griddle and set aside.  Using a sharp
knife, split the fillets in half, horizontally.  Season the fillets
with Essence. In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil.  When the oil
is hot, sear the fillets for 2 minutes on each side and for medium
rare. Remove the fillets from the pan and set aside.  In a pot,
combine the water and vinegar. Season the water with salt. Bring the
liquid to a boil Slide the half of the eggs into the water.  When the
water returns to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the
eggs are set.  Watch carefully and remove the eggs when the yolks are
still soft, about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.  Remove the eggs from the water
and drain on a paper-lined plate.  Season the eggs with salt and
pepper. Return the water to a boil and repeat the process. In a
stainless steel bowl set over a pot of simmering water over medium
heat, whisk the egg yolks with the lemon juice, water, mustard, and
parsley, together. Season with salt and cayenne. Whisk the mixture
until pale yellow and slightly thick. Be careful not to let the bowl
touch the water. Remove the bowl from the pot and whisking
vigorously, add the butter, 1 teaspoon at a time, until all is
incorporated.  To assemble, place the steaks on the English muffins.
Top the steaks with the poached eggs.  Spoon the Hollandaise sauce
over the eggs.  Garnish the eggs with parsley.
