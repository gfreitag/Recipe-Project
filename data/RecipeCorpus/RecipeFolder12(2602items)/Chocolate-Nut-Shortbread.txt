Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Dark, unsweetened cocoa
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  (2 sticks) unsalted butter
2    Squares (2 ounces)
Unsweetened chocolate,
Melted
1/2 c  Finely chopped walnuts or
Pecans
4 ts Sugar
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Cover baking sheet with parchment
paper; draw two circles, each 7 to 7-1/2 inches.

Measure flour, cocoa, sugar and salt into the food processor or into
the large bowl of electric mixer. Mix well. Cut the butter into thin
slices and add to the flour mixture. Mix or process until mixture
resembles moist sand. Add the chocolate and nuts and continue mixing
until a dough forms. Shape dough into a smooth ball. Cut the dough
into quarters. Shape each quarter into a smooth ball. Place dough
ball onto the center of each circle drawn on the parchment paper.
Flatten the round to within 1/2 inch of the inside edge of the round.
With a fork, make impressions on the top of each round and use the
fork to round off the edges. Sprinkle each round with 1 teaspoon
sugar. With a straight knife, cut each round into eight wedges; leave
wedges in place.

Bake for 1 hour or until the shortbread is a light golden color. With
a straight-edged knife, cut the wedges apart while still warm.

Yield: 32 wedges
