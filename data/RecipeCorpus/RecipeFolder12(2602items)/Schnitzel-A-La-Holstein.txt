Title: Schnitzel A La Holstein
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
Two - 4 ounces slices of
Veal, inside round
Salt and pepper
Flour for dredging
Egg wash for dipping-1 egg,
Beaten with 1/4 cup milk
Seasoned bread crumbs, for
Coating
Oil for pan frying
2    Eggs
4    Anchovies, rinsed
2 tb Unsalted butter
1    Lemon, split
1 tb Chopped parsley
1 ts Capers, rinsed
Working with one piece of veal at a time, place the veal slice
between two large pieces of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a
meat mallet, pound the meat until 1/4-inch thick, being careful not
to make any tears in the meat. Repeat with the remaining piece of
veal. Season the veal with salt and pepper. Dredge in the flour,
shake off excess. Dip into the egg wash, allow excess to drip off.
Coat in the bread crumbs.

Heat 3/4 cup of oil in a large skillet until very hot. Place the veal
pieces into the oil. (A sign of a good schnitzel is when the breading
"bubbles" up while pan frying.) Cook until golden brown, about 2
minutes. Flip and cook until golden. Remove and keep warm on a
service platter. Remove the excess oil from the skillet.

Crack the eggs into the skillet, season and cook perfect sunny side up
eggs. Place a cooked egg on top of each veal schnitzel. Criss cross
the egg with 2 anchovies each. In the same pan, brown the butter,
squeeze in the lemon juice, add the parsley and capers and pour the
sauce over the entire platter.
