Title: Individual Apricot Charlottes
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1    Loaf white bread
12 tb (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted
Butter, melted and cooled
Filling:
2 lb Firm apricots, halved,
Pitted and sliced
4 tb (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb Dark rum
1/2 c  Breadcrumbs (from trimmings,
Above)
To line the molds (8, 4 to 6-ounce ramekins): Slice the bread very
thinly. With a cutter, cut out 8 rounds of bread, the size of the
inside bottoms of the molds. Dip in butter and place in molds,
buttered side down. Line sides of molds with 3 to 4 overlapping
rectangles of bread, cut to fit, and dipping in butter before placing
inside molds. Have ready 8 pieces of bread to cover the filling after
it is added to the molds. Place the molds on a jelly roll pan.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and set rack in middle level. For the
filling, prepare apricots and set aside. Melt butter in a shallow
saute pan and add apricots, cooking until they begin to sizzle. Add
sugar and continue cooking another 5 minutes, until juices are
thickened and syrupy. Add rum and allow to boil out. Add crumbs and
stir in.

Fill molds with apricot mixture, then cover with reserved bread,
buttered side out. Bake for 30 minutes, until visible bread is very
well toasted. Serve immediately with whipped cream or apricot sauce.
