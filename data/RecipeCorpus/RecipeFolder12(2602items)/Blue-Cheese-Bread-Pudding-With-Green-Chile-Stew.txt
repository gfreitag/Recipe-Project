Garnish:
1/4 c  Sauteed onions

In a hot skillet, render the bacon; then, saute the carrots and onions
until tender. Add the garlic and quickly saute being careful not to
burn. Add the poblano puree, chicken broth, and hominy, then reduce by
one-quarter. Season to taste.

Spray non-stick food release (approximately 3 ounces) in small
ramekins thoroughly coating them. Place a slice of the french bread
on the bottom and alternate layers of blue cheese with the french
bread, pressing it down as you go. Whip the egg yolk, whole eggs and
cream together. Pour the mixture very carefully into the ramekins so
it is absorbed completely. Place the ramekins in a water bath and
bake in a 360 degree oven for approximately
30    minutes.

Mix the sauteed onions, pumpkin seeds and the honey together.

Unmold the blue cheese bread pudding into the center of a shallow
bowl. Spoon the green chile stew around the bread pudding. Top with
the pumpkin seed-onion salsa and serve.
