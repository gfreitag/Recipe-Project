Preheat the oil for frying sweet potatoes. In a mixing bowl, combine
the first 9 ingredients. Mix well. Shape the mixture into four equal
patties. Wrap each pattie with a piece of caul fat, covering the
pattie completely. In a skillet over medium-low heat, brown the
patties for 2 minutes on each side. After the first 2 minutes add 1/2
cup of water. Flip over the patties and continue to cook for 2
minutes. Add the remaining water and flip over the patties. Continue
to cook for an additional 8 minutes, flipping every two minutes. Fry
the sweet potatoes until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove
the shoestrings from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season
with Essence. Place the burgers in-between the rolls and serve with
the french fries.
