Title: Lemon Butter Sauce
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Dry white wine
3    Lemons, peeled and
Quartered
2 tb Minced garlic
1 tb Minced shallots
1 ts Salt
3    Turns freshly ground black
Pepper
1 ds Worcestershire sauce
1 ds Hot pepper sauce
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 lb (2 sticks) unsalted butter,
Cut up, at room temperature
1 tb Finely chopped fresh
Parsley
Heat a large nonreactive skillet over high heat. When the skillet is
hot, add the wine, lemons, garlic, and shallots. Cook for 3 minutes,
breaking up and mashing the lemons with a wire whisk. Stir in the
salt, pepper, Worcestershire, and hot sauce and cook until the
mixture is somewhat syrupy, for about 3 minutes. Stir in the cream
and cook for 1 minute.

Over low heat, whisk in the butter a few pats at a time. When all of
the butter has been added, remove from the heat, but continue
whisking until all of the butter is incorporated into the sauce.

Strain the sauce, pressing all of the liquid into a bowl. Stir in the
parsley. Serve immediately, or keep warm for a few minutes until
ready to use.
