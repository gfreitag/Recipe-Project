Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 oz Yeast
1 1/2 oz Salt (about 2 tablespoons)
1 1/2 oz Sugar (about 2 tablespoons)
2 qt Water (about 4 cups)
Flour sufficient to make a
Smooth dough (about 8-10
Cups)
Eggwash: 1 egg mixed with 1
ts Water
Dissolve the yeast, salt and sugar into the water and mix the flour
sufficient to make a nice smooth dough of medium degree, not too
stiff or too soft. Work until it no longer adheres to the hand or
bowl, cover with a cloth and let rise until it has doubled in size,
about 5 hours. When it begins to sink, work it well again and set to
rise again. When well risen divide the dough into equal pieces, and
roll into round balls or long loaves of about two inches in
thickness. Lay the loaves on a board previously sprinkled with flour
and at a sufficient distance apart so as not to touch one another,
and set to rise again. Let them rise till double in size.

Brush the loaves with an egg wash. Make diagonal cuts half way across
on each loaf. Bake until lightly golden, about 8-10 minutes. Slice or
tear the bread off and serve it with a spoonful of butter.
