Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM--------------------MOLTO MARIO #MB1D27-------------------------
1    Whole 3-pound fish such as
Snapper, bream, porgy or sea
Bass
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1 c  Gaeta olives
2    Jalapenos, seeded and
Chopped
1    Head fennel, sliced paper
Thin, fronds set aside and
Chopped
1 bn Fresh oregano, leaves only
4 tb Oil, olive
MMMMM------------------------TOMATO SAUCE-----------------------------
1/4    Spanish onion, cut into
1/4    -inch dice
1    Cloves garlic, thinly
Sliced
1 oz Olive oil
1 tb Fresh thyme (or 2
TB dried)
1/8 md Carrot, finely shredded
14 oz Tomatoes; crushed and mixed
Well with their juices
Salt; to taste
BASIC TOMATO SAUCE: Saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil over
medium heat until translucent, but not brown (about 10 minutes). Add
the thyme and carrot and cook 5 minutes more. Add the tomatoes. Bring
to a boil, lower the heat to just bubbling, stirring occasionally for
30 minutes. Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately, or set
aside for further use. The sauce may be refrigerated for up to one
week or frozen for up to 6 months.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Clean and gut fish, remove top and bottom fins, scale and remove
gills. Stand fish up in a shallow casserole, just large enough to
hold the fish. Pour wine over fish and add olives, jalapenos, tomato
sauce, fennel and oregano. Drizzle fish with olive oil, place in oven
and cook until just cooked through, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove,
sprinkle with fennel fronds and serve immediately.

(An excellent contorno for this dish would be tiny potatoes, roasted
with garlic and rosemary.)
