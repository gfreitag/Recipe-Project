Title: Cheese Straws
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
About 1/2 cup freshly grated
Parmesan cheese or sharp
Cheddar
1 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Salt and 1/8 teaspoon
Cayenne pepper
Rectangle of store-bought
Puff pastry, about 9 x 12
Inches
In a bowl combine the cheese, paprika, salt and cayenne and chill
until later.

Roll the rectangle out slightly larger than it is and cover right
half of it with cheese and paprika. Fold left side to cover the
cheese and press edges together. Roll dough out again to a rectangle
which is 9 x 12 inches.

Refrigerate dough on a cookie sheet while you preheat the oven to 375
degrees.

Preferably with a pizza wheel cut dough into 1/2 inch wide by 12-inch
long strips. Twist the strips into corkscrew shapes and set on a
baking pan, pressing ends down so they stick to the pan (helps keep
the shape) Bake for 20 minutes. Cut into smaller "straws".

Yield: 36 cheese straws
