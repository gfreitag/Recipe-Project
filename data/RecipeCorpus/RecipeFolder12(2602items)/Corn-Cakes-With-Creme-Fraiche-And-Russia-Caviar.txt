Roughly chop the corn kernels, or pulse in a food processor until a
chunky but creamy consistency is reached.

Place the corn kernels in a large bowl and whisk in the milk,
cornmeal, and flour, making sure there are no lumps.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, whole eggs, and
egg yolks. Stir into the corn mixture and season with salt, pepper,
and half of the chives.

Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat and add all of the
clarified butter. Pour in batter to make pancakes the size of silver
dollars. Cook for 2 minutes or until golden brown on one side, then
flip. Cook for 2 more minutes. Remove from pan using a slotted
spatula; place four cooked corn cakes on each serving plate. Repeat
process until all the batter is used. Garnish each serving with a
large dollop of creme fraiche and caviar.

Yield: about 12 servings
