Title: Cooked Tomatillo Salsa With Arbol Chiles
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Vegetable oil
3    4 large cloves garlic,
Minced
1 md White onion, finely chopped
3    4 Arbol, chiles finely
Chopped (approximately 1
Tablespoon)
1 lb Drained cooked or canned
Tomatillos
1 c  Chicken broth
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Fresh coriander leaves,
Chopped
You will need a large skillet or heavy saucepan and either a blender
or food processor.

Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet or saucepan over medium high
heat. Add garlic and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until
onion is transparent. Add chiles and cook for one minute more. Add
tomatillos, then pour in broth and add sugar and salt. Bring to a
boil, lower heat and gently simmer uncovered for thirty minutes.
Remove from heat and let cool. Taste for salt and adjust if
necessary. You can either mash the tomatillos with a fork to produce
a coarse-textured salsa, or transfer the sauce to a food processor or
blender to be briefly processed to a smooth texture. Transfer sauce
to a serving dish and just before serving, stir in coriander leaf.

When tomatillos are in season they can be easily cooked by peeling
off the paper-like covering, and then simply boiling the fruits in
several inches of water until softened. We also freeze cooked
tomatillos for use in the cold months. This salsa has great flavor
and a little heat. It can be made with pre-cooked, frozen, and
defrosted tomatillos, as well as canned or fresh cooked tomatillos.

Yield: approximately 2 cups medium-hot green salsa.
