3 tb Sugar
2 c  Heavy cream

1    Vanilla bean, split
Lengthwise
In a medium mixing bowl, using a whip, whisk together the egg yolks
and sugar until they are very pale yellow and smooth.

In a medium saucepan, bring to a boil the heavy cream, sour cream, and
vanilla bean with its scrapings.  Whisk about half into the egg yolk
mixture until well combined, then pour back into the saucepan. Over
medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, cook until the
mixture heavily coats the back of the spoon.  Don't scramble the eggs.

Strain into a clean bowl and set the bowl over ice cubes and cold
water until chilled, stirring occasionally.  Refrigerate, covered,
until needed.

Note:  To make coffee Creme Anglaise, substitute 1/4 cup crushed
coffee beans (with or without caffeine) for the vanilla bean.  Bring
to a boil and let steep in the cream mixture, covered for about 10
minutes. When well flavored, whisk into the egg yolks. then continue
with recipe

To crush coffee beans, place in a plastic bag, close the bag, and
heavily press a rolling pin over the beans.  Do not grind the beans
because this will darken the Creme Anglaise.
