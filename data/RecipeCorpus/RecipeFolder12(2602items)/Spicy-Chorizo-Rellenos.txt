1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Goat cheese

In a large skillet over high heat, heat the olive oil.  Add the
chorizo and saute for about 1 minute.  Add the shallots, garlic and
cilantro and saute for 1 minute.  Stir in the cream and cheese, stir
well and turn off the heat.  Stir in the bread crumbs, turn the
mixture into a bowl, and allow to cool.

Combine the masa harina, 1/2 cup of the flour and 1 tablespoon of
Essence in a bowl.  Fold in the egg white and add the milk 1/4 cup at
a time, mixing thoroughly between additions, until all of the milk is
incorporated and the mixture is smooth.  In another bowl combine the
remaining 1/2 cup flour with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of Essence.

Start heating the oil in a large pot.  Spoon 1/4 cup of the filling
into each pepper through the slit in its side.  Dip each filled
pepper in the batter, then dredge in the seasoned flour.  When the
oil is very hot, fry the rellenos until golden brown, about 3 to 4
minutes. Garnish with cilantro and tortilla strips.
