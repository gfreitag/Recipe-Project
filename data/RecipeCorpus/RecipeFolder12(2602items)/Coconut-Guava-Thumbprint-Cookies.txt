Title: Coconut Guava Thumbprint Cookies
Categories: Toohot, Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/4 c  Grated sweetened coconut
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Rolled oats
12 tb (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted
Butter, softened
1/4 c  Packed brown sugar
1 lg Egg
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
2/3 c  Guava
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line a cookie sheet with parchment
paper.

Place the grated coconut in a shallow bowl and set aside.

Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and oats in a large mixing bowl.

In another bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until
light and fluffy. Then beat in the egg and vanilla. Add the flour
mixture and mix just until combined.

To shape cookies, roll the batter between your hands to form balls
the size of a large walnut. Roll in the grated coconut to coat, then
place on the cookie sheet and flatten to 2 inch circles with the palm
of your hand. With your thumb, make a depression in the center of
each and fill with a generous teaspoon of jam. Bake 20 to 25 minutes,
until lightly browned. Transfer to racks to cool.

Yield: about 24 cookies
