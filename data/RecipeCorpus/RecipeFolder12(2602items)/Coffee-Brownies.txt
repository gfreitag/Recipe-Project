Title: Coffee Brownies
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
5 oz Unsweetened chocolate,
Coarsely chopped
1 1/4 c  Unsalted butter, softened
3    Espresso powder
1/2 ts Salt
2 1/2 c  Sugar
5 lg Eggs
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/4 c  Allpurpose flour
1 c  Pecans, coarsely chopped
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees and butter and flour a 9 x 12inch
baking pan. Line the base of the pan with parchment paper. Combine
the chocolate, butter, coffee, and salt in the top of a double boiler
and, over simmering water, melt the chocolate, stirring occasionally.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, eggs, and vanilla and whisk
until smooth. Add the melted chocolate mixture and continue whisking
until well combined. Fold in the flour until you can't see any traces
of white, but do not overfold. Gently fold in the pecans. Scoop out
into the prepared pan and spread and jiggle the pan until the batter
finds its level.

Bake for about 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the
center of the pan comes out clean. Set the pan on a rack to cool for
1 hour. Run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen, then cut
into squares as desired.

Yield: 12 large or 20 small brownies
