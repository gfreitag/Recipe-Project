pn Grated nutmeg

Make the stuffing: set a skillet over moderately high heat and heat
until hot. Add sausage, crumbled, and cook, stirring occasionally,
for 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to a plate lined with
paper towel and let drain.

Over an open flame or in a hot, dry skillet set over moderately high
heat, toast the Papads for 1 minute, or until crisp and lightly
browned. Let cool for 2 minutes and crumble until they resemble
oatmeal.

In a bowl, combine sausage, Papads, egg, bread crumbs, nutmeg, salt
and pepper and work together to form a slightly wet mass that holds
its shape.

Smooth out the skin of each thigh and create a pocket. Stuff each
thigh between skin and meat with Papad mixture.

Dredge thighs in seasoned flour, shaking off excess. Season with
cayenne, salt and pepper.

In a deep fryer or heavy skillet, heat oil to 370 degrees. Add thighs
and cook, turning occasionally for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden
brown and cooked through. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels
to drain.
