Title: Pate Brisee
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Flour
3/4 ts Salt
9 tb Unsalted butter, cold
6 tb Ice water
Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor and
process a few seconds to mix. Quarter the 3/4 stick of butter
lengthwise and cut into 1/4-inch pieces. Scatter the cubes of butter
evenly over the flour. Pulse the machine until the butter pieces are
about the size of lentils.

Place half the ice water in the bottom of a bowl. Turn the
flour/butter mixture onto it and pour the remaining water evenly over
the top. Using a large rubber spatula, fold the mixture until it is
evenly moistened. Squeeze it; it should hold together. If not,
sprinkle in a little more water and gently mix.

Turn the mixture out on the table and quickly fraiser: using the palm
of your hand, push sections of the dough away from you against the
table. Gather the dough together and fraiser any portions that were
missed. Form the mass into whatever shape you will be rolling out
(ie, disk for round, cylinder for rectangle), and wrap in plastic
wrap. Chill for at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days. Dough can be
frozen for up to 3 months.
