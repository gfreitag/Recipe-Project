Trim the chicken of all fat and, if pieces are thicker than 3/8 of an
inch, pound them between sheets of plastic or waxed paper until they
are more uniformly even. Combine half of the lime juice with the
ground cumin and salt and rub this over the chicken. Preheat the
broiler or grill. Start to grill the chicken and cook for about 6
minutes a side or until just cooked through. Combine the avocados
with the mangoes, cucumbers and remaining lime juice. Season with
salt and pepper. When the chicken is cooked through, remove the
pieces to a cutting board to cool slightly and, in a blender or food
processor, puree the vegetable oil, cilantro, scallion with white
wine vinegar or Verges and season well with salt and pepper. To
serve, cut the chicken, across the grain, on a diagonal, into thin
slices. Spoon about 1 1/2 cups of mango and avocado mix on each
dinner plate. Center the chicken slices over the mango salad and
spoon the cilantro vinaigrette over the chicken. Serve at room
temperature.
