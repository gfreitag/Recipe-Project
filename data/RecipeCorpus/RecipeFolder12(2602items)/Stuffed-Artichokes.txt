Remove the large outside leaves from the artichokes. Cut 1-inch off
the top of the remaining leaves and scoop out the choke from the
center of the artichoke.

Make the stuffing by mixing together the remaining ingredients,
except the oil and wine, and fill the center of the artichokes. Cover
the bottom of a heavy casserole, large enough to hold the artichokes
comfortably, with olive oil. Heat until it is warm, then add the
artichokes. Pour over the white wine, cover and simmer gently for
about 1 hour.
