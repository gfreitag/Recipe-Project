Title: Basic Dough
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Sugar
2 ts Dried yeast
6 c  Flour
2 ts Salt
1 tb Butter, softened
1    Egg, lightly beaten with 1
ts Water, for egg wash
(optional)
Poppy, sesame, caraway or
Fennel seeds or coarse salt,
Or coarse-cracked
Black pepper, for garnish
In bowl of an electric mixer stir sugar into 2 1/4 cups warm water
(110 degrees) until dissolved. Sprinkle yeast over and set aside
until frothy, about 10 minutes. In a large bowl mix together flour
and salt; rub in butter with your fingers. Place bowl with yeast
mixture on electric mixer fitted with dough hook. Start machine on
slow speed and gradually add flour mixture to yeast mixture. Your
dough should be firm; add more flour if needed. Mix until dough comes
together.

Flour work surface and turn out dough. Knead until smooth and
elastic. Oil a bowl and add dough, turning to coat top. Cover and set
aside to double in size. Turn out onto a lightly-floured surface.
Punch dough down and cut into small workable pieces of dough. Shape
into desired shape, such as knots, crescents, breadsticks, round
rolls, or Parker House rolls; place on a baking sheet, leaving enough
room between them for rolls to double. Cover with a towel and place
in a warm draft-free place to double.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. For shiny rolls, brush with egg wash, if
desired. Sprinkle tops with choice of suggested garnishes. Bake until
golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. For thicker, harder crusts,
place a small bowl of water in your oven during cooking to provide
steam; you can also spray your oven with a water mister several times
during baking.

Yield: 12 to 15 rolls, depending on size
