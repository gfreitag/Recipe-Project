Title: Fried Pickles
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
12    Dill pickle spears
Essence
3 c  Flour
2    Egg yolks
3/4    To 1 cup beer
pn Baking powder
Salt and pepper
Oil for frying
Preheat the fryer. Season the pickles with Essence. Season 1 cup of
flour with Essence. In a mixing bowl, whisk the yolks and 3/4 cup of
the beer. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Whisk in enough
flour to form a batter. If the batter is too thick add the remaining
beer to thin the batter. Dredge the spears in the seasoned flour. Dip
the spears in the batter, letting the excess drip off and coating the
spears completely. Gently lay the spears in the hot oil and fry until
golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the spears from the oil
and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the spears with Essence.
Serve the spears with the ketchup.
