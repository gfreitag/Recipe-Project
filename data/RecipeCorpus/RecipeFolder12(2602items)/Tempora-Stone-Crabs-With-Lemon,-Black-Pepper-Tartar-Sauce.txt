1    Beaten egg
2/3 c  Flour
1/2 c  Cornstarch
1 c  Cold soda water
1 ts Salt
2    Dozen Florida stone crabs,
With shell cracked, removed
And meat exposed
Oil for frying
Tartar sauce:
1    Egg
Juice of one lemon
Juice of one lime
2 ts Dijon mustard
1/4 c  Minced onions
2 ts Black pepper
1 c  Olive oil

Preheat the fryer. In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg, flour,
cornstarch, soda water and salt. Blend until smooth. Let the batter
sit for 10 minutes to rest. Using the back of a French knife, crack
the crab shell and expose the meat. In a food processor, combine all
of the remaining ingredients except for the olive oil. Pulse until
smooth. With the machine running, slowly add the olive oil in a
steady stream. Season with salt and pepper. The mixture should be
thick. Dip the exposed meat part of stone crab in the tempura batter.
Fry the stone crabs for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly
golden brown. Remove the stone crabs from the oil and drain on a
paper-lined plate Season with salt and pepper and serve with tartar
sauce.
