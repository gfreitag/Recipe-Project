Title: Deep-Fried Onion Rings
Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Buttermilk
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
Salt and pepper
6    Medium-large sweet onions,
About 1/2 each (such as
Vidalia, Walla Walla,
Maui, Texas Sweet)
Oil, for deep-frying
4 c  Flour
In a large bowl combine buttermilk and baking soda; season well with
salt and pepper. Peel onions and slice thinly, no thicker than
1/4-inch; a mandoline works well. Add to buttermilk mixture and stir
well to submerge all onions. Set aside, unrefrigerated, for 2 hours.

In a deep-fryer or heavy, deep pot, heat at least 1 quart oil to 375
degrees F. Working in batches, place about 1/6 of flour in a large
bowl. With your hands, remove about 1/6 of onions from buttermilk.
Don't let the liquid run off. Add to flour and mix vigorously with
your hands until onions are well-coated. Separate them by hand and
lay them in a deep-fry basket. Lower into hot oil, maintaining
temperature. Stir every 2 minutes. When onions are golden brown and
crisp, about 6 minutes, drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.
Keep warm in a 200 degree F oven while you finish the rest.

Yield: 6 servings
