Title: Popover Pancake With Smoked Salmon And Dill Butter
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
3 lg Eggs
3/4 c  Milk
3/4 c  Unbleached all purpose
Flour
1 tb Snipped fresh dill
1/2 ts Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Unsalted butter
Topping:
2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
3    To 4 slices smoked salmon
1/4 c  Fresh dill sprigs
2 tb Minced sweet onion
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place an 8 to 10-inch cast iron
skillet or other heavy skillet with a heatproof handle in the oven.

Combine the eggs, milk, flour, dill, salt and pepper in a bowl and
whisk until smooth. Using a pot holder, remove the skillet from the
oven and add the butter; swirl the pan to melt the butter and coat
the skillet. Add the batter all at once and immediately return the
skillet to the oven. Bake until the pancake puffs up around the
edges, 18 to 20 minutes.

Cut the pancake into wedges and drizzle with a little melted butter.
Top each with a slice of smoked salmon and a few dill sprigs. Add a
little minced onion, if using, and serve.

Yield: 3 to 4 servings
