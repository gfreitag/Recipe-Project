MMMMM-----------------TAMALES WORLD TOUR #WT1A08----------------------
1/2 c  Small dried red chiles,
Seeded and coarsely chopped
10    Whole peppercorns
1 tb Whole coriander seed,
Toasted
1 ts Cumin seed, toasted
2    Stalks fresh lemongrass
1/4 c  Coarsely chopped fresh
Cilantro root, or leaves and
Stems
2 tb Finely chopped, peeled fresh
Galanga or ginger
1 ts Minced wild or domestic lime
Zest
2 tb Coarsely chopped garlic
1/4 c  Coarsely chopped shallot
2 ts Shrimp paste
1 ts Salt
Place chiles in a small bowl of warm water to soak for 20 minutes.
Combine the peppercorns, coriander seed and cumin seed in a mortar
and grind to a powder with a pestle, or use a spice grinder. Set
aside.

Trim any grassy tops and hard roots off the lemongrass, then finely
chop the stalk. Place the lemongrass, cilantro, galanga and lime peel
in the mortar and grind to break them down. Add the garlic and
shallot and grind until a moist paste forms, about 5 minutes.

Drain the chiles and add them to the paste in the mortar. Add the
spices, shrimp paste and salt and grind well. Transfer paste to a
jar, cover tightly and refrigerate.
