vegetable mill and allow to cool. Place in a mixing bowl with cream,
yolks, eggs and 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese and stir well to

water. Place in oven and bake until set, about 30 to 40 minutes.
Remove and allow to cool slightly. Meanwhile, heat oil in a 12 inch
saute pan over medium heat. Add leeks and garlic and cook until quite
soft, about 9 to 10 minutes. Add muscat and bring to a boil and
reduce until 4 tablespoons remain. Add butter and swirl to emulsify
and remove from heat. Unmold flans and place upside down on plates.
Spoon warm leek mixture over and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
