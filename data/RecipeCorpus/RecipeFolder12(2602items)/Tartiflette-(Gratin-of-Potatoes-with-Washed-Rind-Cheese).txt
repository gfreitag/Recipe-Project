Lardons
6 oz Mushrooms, sliced
Salt and pepper
4 tb Softened butter
4    Potatoes, peeled and sliced

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a skillet saute bacon lardons until
lightly crisp and brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon to paper towels
to drain.  Discard all but 2 teaspoons bacon fat from skillet,
reheat, add mushrooms and saute until lightly brown; season with salt
and pepper.

Generously butter a shallow baking dish with 2 tablespoons butter.
Toss potato slices with salt and pepper and arrange half in a layer
in baking dish.  Sprinkle with bacon and mushrooms and top with half

cream over top to barely cover potatoes.  Dot with remaining butter.
Bake 30 minutes until cream is completely absorbed and potatoes are
tender. Remove baking dish from oven, sprinkle with remaining cheese
and continue to bake until cheese is melted, browned and bubbly, 10
to 15 minutes more. Let sit a few moments before serving.
