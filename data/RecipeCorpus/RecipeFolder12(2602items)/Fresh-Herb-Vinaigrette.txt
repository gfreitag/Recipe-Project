Title: Fresh Herb Vinaigrette
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Balsamic vinegar
1 tb Dijon mustard
1 ts Fresh thyme leaves
1 ts Fresh oregano leaves
8 lg Fresh basil leaves
1/2 c  Extravirgin olive oil
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper to taste
Combine the vinegar and mustard in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse
briefly, then add the herbs. Pulse again until coarsely chopped. With
the processor running, add the olive oil very slowly so that the
mixture will emulsify into a smooth blend. Season with salt and
freshly ground pepper to taste. This dressing will keep for up to 10
days in the refrigerator.

4 6 to 8 ounce swordfish steaks, at least 3/4 inch thick 2 large
vidalia onions, peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick slices 2 sweet red
peppers, seeded and sliced into rings 2 sweet yellow peppers, seeded
and sliced into rings
12    large shiitake mushroom caps 2 tablespoons olive oil Salt
and pepper

The night before, rub the swordfish steaks with the marinade. Cover
and marinate, refrigerated, overnight. The next day, prepare an
outdoor grill for cooking. Right before grilling, toss the onions,
peppers and mushrooms with the olive oil, salt and pepper. When the
grill is hot, grill the swordfish until it is well colored on both
sides and the interior is medium (about 3 to 4 minutes per side,
total).When you have added the fish to the grill, spread the
vegetables along the perimeter of the grill and carefully cook the
vegetables without burning. Remove the fish from the grill, plate,
drizzle with vinaigrette over the fish, top with vegetables and serve.
