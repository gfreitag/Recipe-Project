Title: Honey Almond Stars
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 c  Allpurpose flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Ground coriander
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Ground ginger
3/4 c  Honey
1/2 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
2 lg Eggs
1/2 ts Almond extract
2 c  Almonds, ground fine in food
Processor
1/4 c  Light corn syrup
Juice of 1 lemon
In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt and spices. In
a large saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of the honey and sugars over low heat,
stirring, just until sugars are dissolved. Remove pan from heat and
let mixture cool slightly. In a large bowl, beat together eggs and
extract. Beat in honey mixture and stir in ground almonds.

Stir in flour mixture to form a soft dough. Wrap dough in plastic and
let stand at room temperature for 4 hours.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment
paper. Divide dough into quarters and roll each flat to about 1/4
inch thick. Use starshaped cookie cutters to cut cookies and transfer
to baking sheets, rerolling scraps as needed.

Place cookies in oven and immediately turn down to 325 degrees F.
Bake for 1520 minutes, or until firm. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan,
heat remaining 1/4 cup of honey, corn syrup and lemon juice until it
reaches a boil, about 3 minutes. When cookies are ready, remove them
from the oven and brush warm cookies with the warm glaze. Transfer
sheets of cookies to racks to cool.

Yield: about 3 dozen cookies.
