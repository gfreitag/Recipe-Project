Title: Crispy Fried Chicken
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1    Whole fryer, cut into 8
Pieces
Essence
2 c  Plus 2 tablespoons
Buttermilk
Vegetable oil for frying
2 1/2 c  Flour
2    Eggs, beaten
Salt and pepper
Season the chicken pieces with Essence. Pour 2 cups of the buttermilk
over the chicken and cover with plastic wrap. Place the chicken in the
refrigerator and marinate for 1 hour.

Heat the oil in a large cast iron skillet. Remove the chicken from the
refrigerator and drain. Season the flour with Essence. In a shallow
bowl, whisk the eggs with the remaining buttermilk. Dredge each piece
of chicken in the seasoned flour. Dip each piece of chicken in the
egg wash, letting the excess drip off. Dredge the chicken pieces back
in the seasoned flour, coating each piece of the chicken completely.
Carefully lay the chicken in the hot oil. Fry the chicken for 4 to 6
minutes on each side, or until golden brown and the juices run clear.
Remove the chicken from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate.
Season the chicken with salt and pepper.
