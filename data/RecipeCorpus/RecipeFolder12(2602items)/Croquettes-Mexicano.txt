Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Lard
1    Ancho chile, stemmed and
Seeded
1/2 ts Black peppercorns
1 ts Salt
2/3 c  Water
1 c  Masa harina
6 oz Manchego cheese, cut into 2
1/2    -inch batons
Vegetables oil for frying
1/2 sm Head cabbage, shredded
Chipotle Salsa, for serving
(preferably in a squirt
Bottle)
Crema, for serving
(preferably in a squirt
Bottle)
2    Limes, quartered
To make the dough: in a small skillet, heat the lard over low heat.
Saute the ancho for 1 to 2 minutes, to until slightly softened. With
a slotted spoon, transfer the chile to a blender and add the
peppercorns, salt, and water. Blend to a smooth puree.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the masa with the chile puree. Knead
the dough together well. To test the consistency, flatten a small
ball of dough between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to
the dough, a tablespoon at a time, until a test piece does not crack.
Set the masa aside, covered, at room temperature for 1 hour to allow
the flavor to develop.

Pull off a ball of dough about 2 inches in diameter. Push a piece of
the cheese into the dough and form the dough around it into a
football shaped croquette, encasing the cheese completely. Finish
making the croquettes and heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil to 375
degrees. Fry the croquettes in the hot oil, burning them over when
golden, for about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain briefly on a double thickness
of paper towels and transfer to a warmed platter. Scatter the
shredded cabbage in a thin layer over the top and squeeze a little
lime juice over. Serve with the remaining limes, drizzled with a
little chipotle salsa and crema.

Yield: 12-14 croquettes.
