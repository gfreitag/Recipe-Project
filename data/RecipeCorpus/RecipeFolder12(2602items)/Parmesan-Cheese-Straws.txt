Title: Parmesan Cheese Straws
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 lb Store-bought puff pastry
1 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
Cheese
1 ts Sweet paprika
1    Egg mixed with 1 teaspoon
Water
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Roll the dough into a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Brush with some
of the egg wash and sprinkle with half of the Parmesan and paprika.
Gently run the rolling pin over the dough to press the cheese mixture
into it. Turn the dough over, brush it again with egg wash and
sprinkle with remaining cheese and paprika. Again, gently run the
rolling pin over the dough to press the cheese into it. Transfer the
dough to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and chill for at
least 30 minutes.

Line a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper that does not
extend all the way to the end, leaving about 1 inch of baking sheet
uncovered. With a pastry wheel or sharp knife, cut the dough
lengthwise into 1/2-inch strips. Twist the strips corkscrew fashion
and arrange 1/2 inch apart on the parchment lined baking sheet. Press
the ends of the strips onto the bare baking sheet at each end so they
stick and hold the dough stretched and in place.

Bake in the oven for 10 minutes, or until puffed and golden. Cut
crosswise into 4-inch lengths while hot and let cool on racks.

Yield: about 75 hors d'oeuvres.

Note: Straws may be stored in air-tight containers for 1 to 2 days.
Keep in a cool, dry place. Crisp in the oven before serving.
