2 1/2 c  Flour
1 1/2 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Honey
1    To 2 peaches, chopped
5 tb Shortening
1/2    To 3/4 cup heavy cream

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour,
baking powder, salt, and honey. Stir in the peaches. Cut the
shortening into the flour mixture until it resembles a mealy texture.
Slowly stir in the cream until the mixture resembles a wet mass of
dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Pat the dough down
and gently fold the edges in towards the center. Form the dough into
a circle and 1 inch in diameter. Place the biscuits on a lightly
floured sheet pan. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until the biscuits
are golden. Slice the biscuit in half. Place one half in the center
of the plate. Spoon the berries over the biscuit. Place a scoop of
ice cream on top of the berries. Place the top of the biscuit over
the ice cream, securing in place so the biscuit won't fall off the
ice cream. Spoon the berries over the biscuit. Garnish with mint and
powdered sugar.
