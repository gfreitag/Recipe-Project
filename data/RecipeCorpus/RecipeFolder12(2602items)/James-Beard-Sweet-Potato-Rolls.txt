Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 pk Yeast (1/4 ounce packages)
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Water (110 - 115 degrees)
3 tb Melted butter
1 tb Salt
3    Eggs - one of which is
Beaten together with 2
TB heavy cream
3    To 3 1/2 cups flour
1/2 c  Mashed sweet potatoes
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a bowl combine yeast with 1
tablespoon of sugar and warm water, let proof for 5 minutes. Add
remaining sugar, butter, salt, and 2 of the eggs to the yeast
mixture, stir to blend well. Stir in the flour, 1 cup at a time, and
then stir in the sweet potato. Turn out onto a floured surface and
knead for 2- 3 minutes adding only enough flour to prevent it for
sticking to the board. When the dough is smooth and springy, shape it
into a ball. Place in a oiled bowl, and coat the dough completely
with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place
until it doubles in size, about 1 hour. Punch down the dough and
shape into 2 dozen golf ball sized balls. Place them on a buttered
cookie sheet about 2 inches apart. Cover and let rise until doubled
in size. Brush the rolls with the beaten egg and cream mixture. Bake
at 375 degrees for 20 minutes.

Yield: 2 dozen rolls
