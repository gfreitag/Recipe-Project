Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Minced onions
1    Ear of sweet corn, scraped
From the cob
1 tb Minced shallots
2 ts Chopped garlic
1    Roasted duck breast, (8 to
10    Ounces) pulled
1 c  Cooked black beans
1 c  Cooked white rice
1 tb Chili powder
2 ts Cumin
1 c  Duck or any dark meat stock
Salt and black pepper
1 tb Chopped cilantro
6 lg Flour tortillas
12    Toothpicks
Oil for frying
Essence
1/2 c  Grated Cheddar cheese
1/2 c  Grated Monterey Jack cheese
1 c  Jalapeno Sour Cream
In a large saute pan, over medium heat, add the olive oil. When the
oil is hot, add the onions and saute for 1 minute. Season with salt
and pepper. Add the corn, shallots, and garlic and continue to saute
for 2 minutes. Stir in the pulled meat, black beans, and rice. Season
the mixture with the chili powder and cumin. Add the duck stock and
bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or
until the liquid has reduced by 2/3. Remove the pan from the heat and
reseason if necessary. Stir in the cilantro. Cool the mixture
completely. Preheat the fryer. Spoon 3/4 cup of the filling in the
center of each flour tortilla. Lightly wet the sides of the tortilla
with water. Fold in the sides of the tortilla and roll the tortilla
up tightly, forming a burrito, make sure that the sides are
completely sealed. If necessary, secure the each burrito with the
toothpicks. Place the burritos, a couple at a time in the hot oil and
fry until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Stir the
burritos with a spoon, occasionally for over all browning. Fry the
burritos in batches. Remove the burritos from the oil and drain on a
paper-lined plate. Season the burritos with Essence. Serve the
burritos with the Chili Corn Sauce.

Garnish each burrito with a sprinkle of the two cheeses and Jalapeno
Sour Cream.
