1/2    Bread crumbs, seasoned with

For remoulade: Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and mix
until incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside

For the celery root French fries: Lightly toss the celery root in the
flour. Dip into the egg mixture, removing any excess. Turn into the
bread crumbs, coating both sides completely. In a large saute pan,
heat the vegetable oil. When the oil is hot, add the celery root
fries, carefully not to over- crowd the fries. Fry on one side until
golden, about 2-3 minutes. Turn over and continue frying until done,
about 2-3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a paper
lined plate. Spoon a small amount of the remoulade onto the plate and
pile the fries in the center. Garnish with the Parmesan Cheese and
chives.
