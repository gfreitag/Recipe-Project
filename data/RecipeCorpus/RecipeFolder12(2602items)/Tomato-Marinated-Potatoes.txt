Title: Tomato Marinated Potatoes
Categories:
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM-----------------ESSENCE OF EMERIL #EE2192----------------------
1 1/2 lb Red skin potatoes,
Quartered
4 c  Water
1 c  White wine vinegar
1 tb Salt
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Finely chopped tomatoes
1/2 c  Finely chopped onions
2 tb Dijon mustard
2 tb Chopped thyme
1 tb Chopped garlic
1/2 c  Olive oil
2 tb White wine vinegar
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
Place the potatoes in a medium pot with the water, vinegar, and salt.
Bring to a boil, and simmer until they are tender. (The vinegar adds
flavor as well as helps the potatoes to keep their shape even after
they are tender.) When the potatoes are tender, drain and allow to
cool for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine the
tomatoes, onions, mustard, thyme, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, salt,
and pepper. Mix well. Pour into a zip lock baggie. Place the still
warm potatoes into the bag and coat. Allow the potatoes to sit until
they are room temperature, seal the bag and into the cooler they go.
The potatoes will absorb more flavor if they are still warm when
added to the marinade.
