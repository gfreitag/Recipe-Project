Title: Preparing Sweetbreads
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Sweetbreads
2 c  Milk
2    Lemons, halved
Salt and pepper
Soak sweetbreads in a shallow dish covered with milk. Set aside in a
cool place or refrigerate for at least 4 hours to whiten. Discard
milk, place sweetbreads in a saucepan, squeeze lemons over and drop
in lemon shells as well. Add 1 tablespoon of salt, a pinch of pepper
and cover with water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 10
minutes. Sweetbreads should be about medium when they are done
poaching. Using a slotted spoon transfer sweetbreads to an ice water
bath to cool quickly. Drain and pat dry.

To press sweetbreads, place on a large plate, top with another plate,
and weight with several cans. Set aside, refrigerated, at least 4
hours. Sweetbreads should be pressed to 3/4-inch thickness to give
them a nice, firm texture; if you don't press them enough they will
be spongy.

To clean pieces, remove any excess membranes and veins from pressed
lobes; leave pieces as intact as possible. If lobes are large, slice
them in half horizontally. Sweetbreads are ready to use in any recipe.
