Categories: Emeril, Sides
Yield: 4 Servings
1 ts Plus 2 tablespoons butter,
In all
3 tb Dried fine bread crumbs
1/2 c  Chopped bacon
4    Ears of corn
2 ts Salt, in all
1/4 ts Cayenne
1 c  Chopped onions
2 tb Minced shallots
1 ts Minced garlic
1/2 c  Chopped red bell pepper
2 c  Heavy cream
1 c  Whole milk
6    Eggs, slightly beaten
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/8 ts Grated nutmeg
1/2 c  Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
Cheese
1/2 c  Yellow con meal
Preheat the oven 365 degrees. Butter the bottom and sides of a large
casserole dish (13 inch by 9 inch) with 1 teaspoon of butter.
Sprinkle the bread crumbs evenly on the bottom and sides of the dish.
Cut the corn off the cob with a serrated knife onto a cloth towel.
(This will prevent the corn from making a mess). Scrape the cob to
extract any remaining milk. You should have about 2 cups of the corn
with the milk. In a saute pan, melt the remaining butter. Add the
bacon and saute for about 3 minutes or until the bacon is crispy.
Stir in the corn, 1 teaspoon of the salt and the cayenne. Add the
onions, shallots, garlic, and bell peppers and cook for 3 minutes, or
until the vegetables are wilted. Remove from the heat. In a mixing
bowl, whisk the cream, milk and eggs together. Add the remaining
salt, black pepper, nutmeg, and cheese. Stir the corn mixture and
cornmeal into the cream mixture. Pour into the prepared pan and bake
for 1 hour, or until golden.
