This is a simple recipe. The sauce can be prepared days ahead of time
and reheated. The fritters however should be prepared at the last
minute.

RED WINE STAR ANISE DESSERT SAUCE: Place all ingredients in a
saucepan and bring to a boil. Immediately reduce heat and simmer
slowly for 10 minutes. Off heat, allow to cool and strain. Store
covered in refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.

Fritters: Add the butter and water to a saucepan and bring to a boil.
Remove pan from heat and, with a wooden spoon, beat in flour all at
once to form a smooth paste. Beat lemon juice, zest and vanilla and
then beat in eggs one at a time. Be sure to thoroughly incorporate
each egg before adding the next.

Heat 1/2-inch of oil in a deep skillet or wok to 360 degrees. Working
in batches, drop rounded tablespoons of dough into the oil and fry
until golden brown about 1- 1/2 minutes on each side. Be careful not
to crowd fritters. Drain on paper towels and keep warm in a 225
degree oven for up to 20 minutes.

Place a shallow pool of warm Red Wine Star Anise Sauce in individual
serving bowls. Place 3 or 4 fritters on top. Scatter sliced berries
attractively around and dust with powdered sugar. Serve immediately.
