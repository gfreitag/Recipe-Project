Title: Crispy Traditional Potato Pancakes Served With Rose Zawid
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Russet (baking) or Yukon
Gold potatoes
1 md Onion
1/2 c  Chopped scallions, including
The green part
1 lg Egg, beaten
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper to taste
Vegetable oil for frying
Peel the potatoes and put in cold water. Using a grater or a food
processor coarsely grate the potatoes and onions. Place together in a
fine-mesh strainer or a tea towel and squeeze out all the water over
a bowl. The potato starch will settle to the bottom; reserve that
after you have carefully poured off the water. Mix the potato and
onion with the potato starch. Add the scallions, egg, and salt and
pepper.

Heat a griddle or non-stick pan and coat with a thin film of
vegetable oil. Take about 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture in the
palm of your hand and flatten as best you can. Place the potato
mixture on the griddle, flatten with a large spatula, and fry for a
few minutes until golden. Flip the pancake over and brown the other
side. Remove to paper towels to drain. Serve immediately. You can
also freeze the potato pancakes and crisp them up in a 350 degree
oven at a later time.
