Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Place bones in a roasting pan and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon peanut oil.
Roast in preheated oven, stirring once during roasting, about 12
minutes or until bones are a deep golden brown. When done, remove
from oven and set aside.

Heat remaining 1 2/3 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium
heat . When hot, add onion and saute for 10 minutes or until browned.
Add mushrooms, shallots, and 2 apples and saute for 3 minutes. Add
1/4 cup bourbon and stir well, scraping the bottom of the pan to
incorporate any bits of vegetables stuck there.

Add the browned bones, thyme, sage, chicken stock, and pepper. Bring
to a boil. Lower heat; skim carefully and gently simmer for 30
minutes. Remove bones from sauce and add remaining apple. Cook for an
additional 10 minutes.

Pour into a blender and blend for 10 to 15 seconds. Strain through a
coarse strainer, pressing well to allow as much pulp as possible to
pass through. Add remaining 1/8 cup bourbon and season with salt and
lemon juice. Keep warm until ready to serve.
