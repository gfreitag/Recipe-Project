2    Cloves garlic, minced
1 lg Green, unripe papaya, peeled

1    Carrot, peeled and shredded
1/4 c  Crushed fermented crab, or

In a large heavy bowl, or mortar and pestle, combine the chiles and
garlic with a spoon, pressing down gently to break them down
slightly. Add the papaya and mix, again pressing down to soften the
shreds. Add the carrots and crab or shrimp and toss.  Add the sugar,
salt, fish sauce, and lime juice and toss well.  Add the cherry
tomatoes and toss to combine. Set aside.  Preheat grill. Using a
sharp knife, cut through the shell to make a slit down the back of
each prawn, leaving the shell on. Thread 2 prawns onto each skewer.
Brush the prawns with oil and place on the hot grill. Grill for 1 to
2 minutes per side, or until just cooked through. Transfer the salad
to a serving platter or individual plates, top with the grilled
prawns, and garnish with lime wedges.
