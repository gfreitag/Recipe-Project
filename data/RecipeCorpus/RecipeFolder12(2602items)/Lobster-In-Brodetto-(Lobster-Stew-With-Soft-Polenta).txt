Title: Lobster In Brodetto (Lobster Stew With Soft Polenta)
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
6 sm Lobsters
Unbleached flour for
Dredging
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
3 c  Diced onions
1/2 c  Olive oil
6 tb Tomato paste
1/2 c  Red wine vinegar
5 c  Hot water
1/2 ts Salt
4 c  Crushed Italian plum
Tomatoes
Cut off lobster tails at body junctures and dredge exposed meat
lightly in flour, shaking off excess.  In a large skillet, heat
vegetable oil just short of smoking point, add lobster tails, meat
side-down, and saute about 2 minutes, until golden brown.  Set tails
aside.

In a large non reactive saucepan or small stockpot, saute onions in
1/3 cup of the olive oil until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add
lobster shells, stir and cook 5 minutes.  Stir in tomato paste and
cook over medium heat additional 5 minutes.  Blend vinegar with hot
water, add to pan and bring to a full boil.  Add salt and tomatoes,
bring to boil and cook 3 minutes. Remove lobster bodies with tongs,
allowing all interior juices to drain back into sauce.  (Bodies
should be reserved for other uses, or, if the meal is to be informal,
may be served on a communal platter in the center of the table. The
most delicate meat is in those bodies and should not be wasted.).

Add claws, cook 7 minutes and add reserved tails and remaining olive
oil. (If the brodetto is to be served with spaghetti, the pasta
should be added to the boiling water at this point). Cook 3 to 5
minutes longer over high heat, skimming off all surface foam. Remove
tails and claws, and keep warm under aluminum foil. Boil sauce
briefly to affect a slight reduction and concentration of the
flavors. Add hot pepper flakes if desired.
