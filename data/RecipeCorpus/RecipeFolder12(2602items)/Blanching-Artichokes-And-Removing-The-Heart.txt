Categories:
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-----------------ESSENCE OF EMERIL #EE2370----------------------
3    Lemons, cut in half
1 tb Crab boil
1 lg Onion, chopped
Bouquet garni
Salt and pepper
2    Whole artichokes
1 c  Chiffonade of baby greens
1 c  Assorted cooked seafood
(oysters, shrimp, bay
Scallops, and crabmeat)
1/2 c  Herb vinaigrette
2 tb Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
Cheese
In a pot of water, add the juice of the lemons, crab boil, onions, and
bouquet garni. Season with salt and pepper. Add the artichokes,
flower side down. Cover with a cloth napkin. This will keep the
artichokes submerged in the water. Cook for 20-40 minutes, depending
on size or until the artichokes are tender. Remove from the heat and
shock in an ice bath. With a small spoon remove the furry choke from
the center of the artichoke. Toss the greens with some of the herb
vinaigrette. Season with salt and pepper. Toss the seafood with the
vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper. Stuff the whole
artichoke with the greens and seafood. Garnish with any remaining
vinaigrette, cheese and parsley.
