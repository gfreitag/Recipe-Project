Title: Caramelized Onion Tarts
Categories: Mario
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Extra virgin olive oil
5    Spanish onions, peeled and
Sliced 1/4inch thick
4    Anchovy fillets
1 tb Freshly chopped thyme
Leaves
2 c  Flour and board flour
1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil
1/2 c  Milk, barely warmed
2    Eggs
4 tb Cream
In a 12 inch to 14 inch saute pan, heat oil over medium heat until
smoking. Add onions, anchovies and thyme and cook, stirring regularly
until golden brown and very soft, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from
heat and allow to cool.

Meanwhile, place flour, olive oil and milk in a mixing bowl and use
your hands to toss to form loosely bound "dough." Form into a ball,
wrap in plastic and chill 10 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

When onions have cooled, mix with eggs and cream and season with salt.
Divide dough into 4 pieces, roll into 4 inch rounds and crimp edges.
Divide onion mix on to rounds, place rounds on a cookie sheet with
parchment and bake 20 minutes until golden brown. Serve warm or at
room temperature.
