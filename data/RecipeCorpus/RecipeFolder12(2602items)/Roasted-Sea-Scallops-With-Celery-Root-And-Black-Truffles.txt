place in a bowl. Slice the radishes and chop the chives. Add celery
leaves, seasoning, lemon juices, and olive oil before serving.

Preparing the Scallops:

Season the scallops. Heat a saute pan over high heat and sear the
scallops well in olive oil and flip over. Add whole butter and brown.
Remove scallop from the pan and keep warm.

Place a spoon full of celery root ragout in the middle of a bowl, the
scallop on top, and the salad on top of that. Serve hot
