Preheat the oven 400 degrees. For the spatzle: Cook the apples, wine,
lemon juice, shallots and garlic, down until the apples are soft.
Remove from the heat and puree until smooth. Bring a pot of salted
water to a boil, reduce the heat, and maintain a simmer. In a bowl,
stir the apple puree, eggs, flour, 1 teaspoon salt and baking powder
together. Place a colander over the pan, and press through the holes
into the hot water using a rubber spatula. When the spatzle floats to
the surface, cover and cook the spatzle until it swells and is
fluffy. Remove from water and shock in ice water. Drain the spatzle
and set aside. For the veal chops. In a saut√© pan, heat the olive
oil. When the pan is smoking hot, sear each chop for 2-3 minutes on
each side. Season each chop with Essence. Remove from the pan and
allow to cool. Cover each chop with the mustard and crust with the
chopped herbs. Place the chops in the oven and cook for about 15
minutes or until medium-rare. In a sauce pan, heat the veal reduction
and grilled apples together. Bring up to a simmer and season. In a
saute pan, melt the butter. Add the spatzle and saute for 3-4
minutes. Stir in the parsley and season. Spoon the sauce over the
platter. Mound the spatzle in the center of the sauce. Place the
chops on top of the spatzle with their bones crossing. Garnish with
chives and Essence.
