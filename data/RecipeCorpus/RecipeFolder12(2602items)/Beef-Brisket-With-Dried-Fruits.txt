2 lg Onions, chopped fine
1 c  Beef broth
1/4 c  Apricot jam

In a large heavy flameproof casserole heat the oil over moderately

patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, and transfer it to a
plate. Add the onions to the casserole and cook them over moderate
heat, stirring, until they are golden. Add the broth, jam, brown

taste and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring. Add the brisket with
any juices that have accumulated on the plate and simmer the mixture,
covered, for 2 hours. Add the apricots, prunes, and beer and simmer
the mixture, covered, for 1 1/2 hours more, or until the brisket is
tender. Transfer the brisket with slotted spoons to a cutting board
and let it stand, covered loosely, for 10 minutes. Discard the
strings, slice the meat across the grain, and arrange it on a heated
platter. Spoon some of the sauce over the meat and serve remaining
sauce separately.
