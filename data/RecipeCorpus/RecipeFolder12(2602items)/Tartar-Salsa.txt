*RAW EGG WARNING

The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against
consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may
be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of
food poisoning....Healthy people need to remember that there is a
very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods
accordingly. Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled,
fresh, grade AA or A eggs. Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the
shell."
