Title: Potato Onion Galette
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
1    Recipe Pate Brisee
1 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Oil
1 tb Fresh thyme, chopped
Kosher salt
Pepper
3 md Onions (about 1 1/4 pounds),
Thinly sliced
1 1/4 lb Potatoes, peeled and diced
In 1/2-inch cubes
6 tb Parmesan cheese
Egg wash (lightly beaten egg
With 1 teaspoon milk)
Make the pate Brisee and roll into a cylinder.  Chill for 1/2 hour or
up to 3 days.

Heat the butter and 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet.
Season with salt, pepper and thyme and cook the onions over medium
low heat until caramelized.  Remove the onions from skillet and set
aside in a bowl to cool.  Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the
skillet and saute the potatoes, seasoned with salt and pepper, until
about 3/4 cooked. Combine the potatoes with the onions, mix in 1/4
cup Parmesan and set aside to cool completely.  Preheat oven to 400
degrees. Cut the cylinder of dough in half and refrigerate one half.
Press the piece of dough into a rectangle and then roll it, on a
lightly floured surface, into a rectangle measuring about 17 x 8
inches. Brush off any excess flour and transfer the dough to an
ungreased cookie sheet. Position it so that there is room for the
second piece.  Refrigerate the tray while you roll out the second
piece of dough in the same way and place it on the cookie sheet.
Using a serrated pastry wheel, trim the edges of the rectangles to
even them. Cut a "v" out of each corner to prevent the dough from
bunching when it's folded. Spread half the potato/onion mixture on
each, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border all around. Fold up the edges.
Brush the dough with egg wash and sprinkle the remaining Parmesan
over the dough and filling. Bake about 40 minutes, or until the crust
is nicely browned.  Slice each section on the diagonal into about 6
pieces.

Yield: about 12 slices
