brush cut surfaces with oil and set them face down on a baking sheet.

large the squash is.

While this is baking, bring the milk, cinnamon stick, cloves and
garlic to a simmer. Remove from heat and let the milk infuse while
squash is baking.

When squash is done, remove it from oven and scoop out the cooked
flesh which you should transfer to a food processor or blender.
Strain the infused milk to remove the spices and garlic and blend
infused milk with the squash to make a puree. Beat in butter if you
wish and season to taste with salt and pepper. You can make this in
advance and reheat in a double boiler.
