Title: Cranberry Walnut Tartlets
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
8 tb (1 stick) unsalted butter,
Softened
1 c  Plus 6 tablespoons
Confectioner's sugar,
Sifted
1    Egg
1 ts Salt
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Light corn syrup
4 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
4 tb (1/2 stick) unsalted butter,
Melted
Grated zest of 1 orange
2 c  Walnuts, coarsely chopped
2 c  Fresh or frozen cranberries
Prepare tart shells: In an electric mixer, cream together butter and
sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg and salt, and beat until
combined. Add flour all at once, and slowly mix just until flour is
evenly moistened. You don't want to mix until a ball forms around the
beaters.

Transfer to a plastic bag and form into a 6 inch log. Seal bag,
pressing out any air, and refrigerate a minimum of 4 hours or as long
as 4 days.

Divide log into 8 parts. On a lightly floured board, roll dough into
rounds to fit 8 individual tart pans, 3 inch round x 1 inch deep. The
dough should be about 1/8 inch thick. Chill tart shells for 1/2 hour.

Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line tart shells with parchment paper and
fill with pie weights or dry beans. Bake 10 minutes, remove foil and
weights and bake shells 5 minutes longer. Remove and cool.

Prepare tart filling: In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, corn
syrup, eggs, butter and orange zest. Divide walnuts and cranberries
evenly among the partially baked tart shells. Pour sugar mixture over
walnuts and cranberries.

Bake tarts 20 to 25 minutes or until crusts are golden. The edge of
the filling will be firmer than the center. Cool tarts of wire racks
and refrigerate until ready to serve. Remove cooled tarts from pans
and serve.
