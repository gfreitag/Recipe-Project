Title: Shao Mai (Pork Dumplings)
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Ground pork
1 c  Finely chopped water
Chestnuts
1 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Rice wine vinegar
1 tb Sesame oil
2 ts Sugar
2 ts Freshly grated ginger
2 tb Cornstarch
1 ts Coarse salt
1/2 ts Finely ground black pepper
30    Shao mai or dumpling
Wrappers
Combine the pork, water chestnuts, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, sugar,
ginger, cornstarch, salt and pepper in a bowl and mix well to combine
(hands work well for this). Place a dumpling wrapper in the palm of
one hand and cup it loosely. Place a generous tablespoon of filling
in the center of the wrapper. With your free hand, gather the sides
of the wrapper around the filling, letting the wrapper pleat
naturally. Squeeze the middle gently and tap the dumpling to flatten
the bottom so that it can stand upright. The meat filling will show a
little at the top. Make the remaining dumplings in the same manner.

Arrange filled dumplings about 1/4 inch apart in two steamer trays
that have been lined with wet cheesecloth. (At this point, you can
refrigerate dumplings, covered, for 23 hours.)

When ready to steam, fill a wok or lower part of a steamer with water
so that it comes within an inch of the steamer tray, and bring to a
rolling boil. Stack the steamer trays in the wok or steamer, cover
tightly, and steam dumplings for 2025 minutes over high heat,
reversing the trays after 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer
dumplings to a platter and serve with Spicy Dipping Sauce.

Yield: 30 dumplings
