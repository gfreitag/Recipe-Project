Title: Garlic Pan- Roasted Game Hens
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Olive oil
2    Game hens, about 1 and 1/2
lb Each, split in half
4 sm Peeled garlic cloves
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
1/4 c  Chicken broth
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1/2 ts Dried rosemary
2 ts Dijon mustard
Salt
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet, over medium heat for about 2
minutes or until almost smoking. Add the game hens, skin side down,
and saute for 5 minutes or until golden. With tongs, turn the hens
over, add the garlic and saute for another 5 minutes.

Add the vinegar and broth which will bubble up, then the thyme and
rosemary. Cover and simmer, over low heat, for 25 to 30 minutes or
until the juices run clear, not rosy, when the thigh is pricked with
a fork. Transfer the hens to a plate. Stir the mustard into the
juices in the skillet and boil down furiously, until 1/2 cup of
liquid remains, scraping the brown cooking particles into the sauce.
Season with salt and pepper, spoon over the hens and serve
immediately.
