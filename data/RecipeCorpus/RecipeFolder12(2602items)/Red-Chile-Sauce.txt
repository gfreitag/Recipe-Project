Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 lb Plum tomatoes (4 to 6)
10    Dried New Mexico red chiles
2    Dried ancho chiles
10    Dried cascabel chiles
4 c  Water

1/2 ts Ground cumin

Cut off stem ends of tomatoes and roast them in a cast-iron skillet
over high heat until their skins blacken. Transfer to a blender or
food processor. Dry skillet and return to high heat. Add dried chiles
and roast them, stirring, until they begin to release their aroma,
about 3 minutes. Transfer chiles to a bowl and pour water over. Leave
to soften and rehydrate, 10 to 15 minutes. Add softened chiles to
tomatoes. Taste chile water; if it is not bitter, add 1 cup to food
processor and reserve remaining water separately, or use plain water.
Wipe out skillet, heat olive oil over high heat, add onion and saute
over medium heat until browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer onions to
food processor along with chipotle pepper with its sauce, garlic,
cumin, oregano and salt to taste. Puree to a fine paste, stopping
once or twice to scrape down sides of workbowl with a rubber spatula.
If needed, add a little more water to processor.

In a large skillet heat vegetable oil until just smoking, add chile
puree and heat until sizzling. Fry sauce, stirring continuously, 3 to
5 minutes. If sauce becomes too thick, thin it with a little more
chile water.

Serve warm with tamales or grilled meats. Or cool and refrigerate up
to 1 week.
