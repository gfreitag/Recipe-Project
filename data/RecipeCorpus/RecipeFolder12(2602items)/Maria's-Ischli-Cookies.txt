Title: Maria's Ischli Cookies
Categories: Tvfn, Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 lb Almonds or hazelnuts, finely
Ground
1/2 lb Butter, at room temperature
1/4 lb Sugar
1/2 lb Flour
Seedless raspberrry
Preserves
Chocolate icing (see recipe
Below)
If you cannot buy nuts already ground, then grind them in a food
processor, taking care not to overprocess them or they will turn
oily; you can also process them with the sugar to prevent them from
turning oily.

(Note if you are working with whole hazelnuts, toast them first in a
400 degree oven, rub off skins, let cool and then grind.)

Combine the nuts with the butter, sugar and flour; you will have to
combine this dough with your hands; if a bit too dry, add drops of
lemon juice or rum. Form dough into a roll 1 1 /4inches thick.
Refrigerate overnight in waxed paper or parchment.

Following day preheat the oven to 350 degrees. cut dough into 1/4inch
slices and bake on an ungreased cookie sheet for 15 minutes or until
golden. Remove from oven and cool cookies on a rack.

When cooled to room temperature, sandwich two cookies together with
raspberry jam and spread some of the chocolate icing (see below) over
the top cookie. For a pretty presentation, set them in fluted paper
cups.

Yield: 2 dozen
