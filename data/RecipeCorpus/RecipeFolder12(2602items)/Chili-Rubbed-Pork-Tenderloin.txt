Title: Chili Rubbed Pork Tenderloin
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
Marinade-
2 tb Chili paste
1/2 c  Orange juice
Juice of 1 lemon
3 tb Honey
3 tb Brown sugar
2 tb Tomato ketchup
1 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
3 tb Mango chutney finely
Chopped
2 lb Pork tenderloin
Combine all of the marinade ingredients in a container large enough to
accommodate the pork tenderloin strips. Add the pork, turning to cover
completely with the marinade, and marinate in the refrigerator
overnight, or for at least several hours before cooking.

The pork is particularly delicious marinated overnight and grilled on
an outdoor barbecue grill. In a pinch, it can be broiled in a hot oven
broiler, or roasted in a 375 degree oven. In any case, each
tenderloin is small, so they should cook in no more than 15 to 20
minutes.

If grilling outdoors, prepare a barbecue with white-hot coals. Remove
the pork from the marinade, letting the excess drip back into the
container. Season each tenderloin lightly with salt and pepper. Brush
the grill with cooking oil. Lay the pork on the grill and cook,
turning frequently to avoid burning. Before removing it from the
grill, broiler, or oven, use a meat thermometer to check that the
pork has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees.

Put the remaining marinade in a sauce pan with 1/2 cup water and
bring to the boil, reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. When the
tenderloin is done, slice and serve together with the hot marinade.
