For the ragout: In a mixing bowl, combine the flours and Essence
together and toss the rabbit, lightly coating each piece. In a saute
pan, heat the olive oil. When the pan is smoking hot, add the rabbit
meat. Season with salt and pepper. Saute for 1-2 minutes to form a
good sear on the meat. Add the onions, carrots, and potatoes,
tomatoes, green onions, shallots and garlic. Saute the mixture for
2-3 minutes. Add the veal stock and reduce by half, about 3-4
minutes. Finish with the butter and season with salt and pepper.

For the grits: In a small sauce pan, bring the milk to a boil. Add the
butter. While stirring, slowly add the grits, making sure to not make
lumps. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally for 15-20 minutes
or until the grits are tender and slightly thick. Add the cream and
cheese, stirring until the cheese is completely melted. Season with
salt and pepper. To assemble, mound the grits in the center of the
bowl. Spoon the ragout over the top. Place the fried parsnips right
in the center of the ragout, down into the grits. Sprinkle with the
cheese and green onions. Essence the rim.
