Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Ground pork
3 tb Fennel seeds
1/2 bn Fresh sage, chopped
2 ts Salt
1 ts White pepper
8    Hardcooked eggs, peeled and

3 c  Fine, dry bread crumbs
4    Eggs, beaten
4 c  Vegetable oil

Mix together pork, fennel seed, sage, salt, and pepper.  Divide into 8
equal portions.  Form a patty in your hand with the first portion.
Flatten patty, place egg inside, and keep rolling egg and meat in the
palms of your hands, until a thin layer of meat coats the eggs.

Repeat this procedure until all the eggs are coated with pork mixture.
Chill 20 minutes.  Dip chilled, coated eggs first in bread crumbs,
then in eggs and bread crumbs again.  Chill 15 minutes. Preheat oven
to 375 degrees F. Heat oil in a large stockpot or saucepan to deepfry
temperature (350 degrees F).  Fry eggs, 2 or 3 at a time, until
golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain on paper towels. Transfer to a
roasting pan and bake10 minutes.  To serve, arrange a bed of
Watercress Salad on each serving plate.  Slice eggs in half and place
4 halves on top of each salad. Garnish with tomato slices and dollops
of Horseradish and Mustard and Mayonnaise for dipping.  Serve while
eggs are warm.
