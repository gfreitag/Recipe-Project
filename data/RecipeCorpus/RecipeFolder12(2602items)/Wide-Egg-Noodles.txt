Title: Wide Egg Noodles
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
5 c  Semolina flour
3    Eggs
3    Egg yolks
1 ts Plus 1 to 2 tablespoons
Olive oil
1 ts Plus 1 tablespoon salt
2    To 12 tablespoons cold
Water
1/4 c  Chopped parsley
Place semolina in a large bowl. In a small bowl, combine eggs, egg
yolks, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and water, and pour
into flour. Stir with a wooden spoon until the flour clumps together
and forms a dry, firm ball.

Knead 5 to 7 minutes, until smooth. Dough should be quite stiff.
Cover with a damp cloth and set aside to rest 15 minutes. Divide
dough into 4 equal pieces. Set 3 pieces aside, under cloth, and begin
rolling fourth.

First flatten by hand. Then, with pasta machine at widest setting,
roll 3 times, folding in half lengthwise between turns. It should be
smooth and wide as the rollers. Reduce setting, rolling dough through
once at each, until you reach the next to the thinnest setting.

Trim dough into 12-inch lengths, dust with flour, and cut with
fettucine blade. Fluff strands to separate and set aside on floured
trays. Repeat

procedure with remaining 3 portions.

To cook fresh noodles, bring about 3 gallons water to a rapid boil
with 1 tablespoon salt. Cook pasta until al dente, about 3 minutes.
Drain in a colander and serve. If making in advance, immediately
transfer to a large bowl of iced water and chill. Drain and place in
a plastic container. Toss with a tablespoon or two of olive oil and
store in refrigerator until ready to use.

Finished pasta can be reheated in a shallow pan, on top of stove.
Combine with 1 tablespoon oil, 3 tablespoons water, or a scant 1/4
cup cream. Warm over moderate heat, adding 1/4 cup chopped parsley,
shaking pan to avoid scorching.
