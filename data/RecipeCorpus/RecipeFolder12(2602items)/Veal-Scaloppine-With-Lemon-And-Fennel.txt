Title: Veal Scaloppine With Lemon And Fennel
Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
1    Head fennel
3 tb Virgin olive oil plus 4
Tablespoons
1 lb Veal hip or top round
1/4 c  Flour
1 c  Chicken broth
Juice and zest of 1 large
Lemon
1 bn Italian parsley, finely
Chopped to yield 1/4 cup
Core fennel and cut in half.  Cut each half into 1/8th-inch julienne.
In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over
medium heat until just smoking.  Add fennel and cook, stirring often
until soft and golden, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from pan and
set aside. Slice veal into 1/8th-inch thick slices (or arrange to
have your butcher do this for you).  Pound each piece of veal with a
meat hammer until nearly paper thin. Season each piece with salt and
pepper and dredge in flour. Heat remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil in
a 12- to 14-inch saute pan until smoking. Add 4 pieces dredged veal
and cook until light golden brown on each side, about 2 minutes.
Remove to plate and continue with remaining pieces. When second batch
is browned, add first batch back into pan and add chicken broth and
lemon juice and cook 2 to 3 minutes, until liquid is nearly gone.
Remove veal to platter, add fennel and parsley and pour sauce over
meat. Sprinkle with lemon zest and serve.
