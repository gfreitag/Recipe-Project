Title: Pickled Mirlitons
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
8 md Mirlitons
4 md Carrots, cut into 3-inch
Julienne
1 lg Vidalia onion, halved and
Cut lengthwise into 1-inch
Slices
20    Garlic cloves
4 qt Distilled white vinegar
6    Bay leaves
1/2 c  Salt
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Black peppercorns
1 ts Cayenne
2 ts Dry mustard
Cut the mirlitons in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds. Cut each half
lengthwise into slices about 1/2-inch thick. Put the mirlitons,
carrots, onions, and garlic in a large bowl. Cover with ice and cold
water. Let sit for 2 hours to perk up the vegetables. Drain
thoroughly. In a large nonreactive stockpot, combine the vinegar, bay
leaves, salt, sugar, peppercorns, cayenne, and mustard. Bring to a
boil. Add the vegetables, reduce the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes.
Remove from the heat. Sterilize 7 quart-size preserving jars and keep
hot. Soak the lids and keep hot. Pack each jar tightly with the
vegetables, dividing them evenly, and enough of the hot liquid to
come within 1/2-inch of the top. With a clean damp towel, wipe the
rim and fit with a hot lid. Tightly screw on the metal ring and
process in a hot-water bath for 15 minutes. Using tongs, remove the
jars, place on a towel, and let cool. Test seals. Tighten the rings.
Store in a cool dry place. Let age for 4 to 5 weeks.

Once pickled, mirlitons can be used in salads, as a relish or to
garnish a martini.
