Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Butter cookie crumbs
1 c  Ground pecan pieces
1    Stick melted butter
3 lb Cream cheese, softened and
Cubed
1 c  Steen's Pure 100 percent
Cane Syrup
6    Eggs
1 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Flour
pn Salt
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Vanilla
1 lb Sweet potatoes, roasted
Peeled and mashed
2 c  Sweetened whipped cream
ds Bourbon
1 c  Chocolate sauce
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the crumbs, ground pecans
and the butter together. Mix well and press into a 10-inch
spring-form pan. In a food processor, with the metal blade, mix the
cream cheese until smooth. Add the cane syrup and blend. Add the eggs
one at a time to thoroughly incorporate into the cheese mixture. Add
the heavy cream. Add the flour, salt, cinnamon and vanilla and blend
until smooth. Add the mashed sweet potatoes and blend until smooth.
Pour into the prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until
the cake is set. Remove from the oven and with a knife loosen the
sides from the pan. This will prevent the cake from spiting down the
center. Completely cool the cake before cutting. For the sauce: In a
mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients together and allow to sit
for 2 to 3 hours. Combine the whipped cream and bourbon together,
blend well. Garnish each piece of cake with the Bourbon Whipped Cream
and a drizzle of chocolate sauce.
