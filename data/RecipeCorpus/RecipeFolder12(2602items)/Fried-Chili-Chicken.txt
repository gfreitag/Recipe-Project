1 tb Cumin

Cut the chicken into serving pieces. The breast pieces should be cut
in half. Place the chicken in a bowl and cover with the buttermilk
overnight.

In a mediumsize bowl, combine the flour, paprika, cumin, cayenne,
salt, and pepper.

Heat enough oil to a depth of about 3/4-inch in a large heavy
skillet. When the oil is mediumhot dip the chicken pieces in the
flour mixture and fry, without crowding the chicken. If necessary,
use 2 skillets or fry in batches.

Reduce the heat to medium and fry until the coating becomes a deep
golden brown, turning the chicken as needed. The white meat should be
done in 20 to 25 minutes, dark meat in about 35 minutes. Juices
should run clear when the chicken is pricked with a fork. Squeeze
lime juice over the chicken 10 minutes before it is done. Drain
chicken on paper towels.
