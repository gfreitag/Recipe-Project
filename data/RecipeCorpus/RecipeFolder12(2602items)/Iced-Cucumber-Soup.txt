Title: Iced Cucumber Soup
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
3    Kirby cucumbers
1 ts Salt
2 c  Plain yogurt, whole milk or
Low fat
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
1    Whole peeled garlic clove,
Crushed and skewered with a
Toothpick
1/4 c  Packed fresh mint leaves off
The stem and chopped
Roughly
Water
1/4 c  Raisins plumped up in hot
Water
1/4 c  Walnuts, finely chopped
1/4 c  Snipped chives
1/2 c  Crushed ice cubes, optional
Peel and seed the cucumbers, cut them into 1/4-inch dice and toss
with the salt; set aside for 15 minutes. Transfer the cucumber cubes
to a sieve, rinse them under water and pat dry with towels.

In a bowl combine the cucumbers and yogurt. Gradually and slowly
whisk in the olive oil, making sure yogurt absorbs it all. Add the
garlic clove and mint, cover and refrigerate until well chilled. (If
taking the soup on a picnic, chill it first in a bowl, then transfer
it to a thermos.)

Before serving, remove the garlic cloves, give the soup a stir and
thin with ice water if you wish; adjust the seasoning.

Ladle the soup into chilled soup plates and stir in the raisins, then
garnish with walnuts and chives. If you wish, immediately before
serving, you can drop some crushed ice into each plate
