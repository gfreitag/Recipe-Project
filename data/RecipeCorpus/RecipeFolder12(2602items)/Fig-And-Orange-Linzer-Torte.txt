Title: Fig And Orange Linzer Torte
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Dried figs
1/2 c  Orange juice
1/4 c  Honey
1/4 ts Cinnamon
Walnut Linzer Dough:
1 1/2 c  Flour
1 1/2 c  Walnut pieces, finely ground
2/3 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Cloves
1 ts Baking powder
1 1/2    Sticks butter
1    Egg
1    Egg yolk
1 ts Grated orange zest
Garnish:
Confectioners' sugar
Lightly butter a 10 by 2-inch deep layer pan.

For the filling, stem and dice the figs and combine with remaining
ingredients in a nonreactive saucepan.  Bring to a simmer and cook
over low heat, stirring occasionally, until figs are soft and mixture
is thickened. Stir often as the filling thickens to avoid scorching.
Cool and puree in the food processor. Set a rack in the middle level
of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. For the dough, combine dry
ingredients in a mixing bowl. Rub in butter evenly, making sure
mixture does not become pasty. Whisk egg, yolk and orange zest and
stir in, continuing to stir until a soft dough forms.  Spread 2/3 the
Linzer dough in the bottom of the prepared pan. Evenly spread the
filling on the dough, keeping it about 1/2-inch from the edge.  Place
the remaining dough in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain
tube.  Pipe 4 lines of the dough, spaced equidistant from each other,
over the filling. Pipe 4 more lines diagonal to the first ones. With
the remaining dough, pipe a series of small spheres around the edge.
Bake the Linzer Torte for 45 minutes, until the center is firm when
gently pressed with a fingertip.  Cool in the pan on a rack.  Unmold
and dust lightly with confectioners' sugar immediately before serving.
