Title: Baked For Dinner Potatoes
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
4    Idaho or Russet potatoes,
Ea weighing about 8 ounces
Olive oil
4    Red bell peppers, seeded and
Finely julienned
1 lb Mushrooms, stemmed and
Finely sliced
Pesto, sun dried tomato or
Black olive paste to taste
Salt and pepper
Yogurt or chunk Parmesan
Cheese optional
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Wash the potatoes, prick them and bake
for about an hour or until done.  (If kids don't like very crunchy
exterior, scrub the potatoes clean, wrap them in foil and then bake;
they will then steam rather than bake.)

Meanwhile, heat olive oil and saute peppers and mushrooms until
tender. Remove from heat and stir in pesto, or other paste to taste
and season with salt and pepper.

When potatoes are done, split them almost all the way to the bottom
and squeeze up some of the potato flesh; spoon vegetable topping over
and around potatoes.  If you did not add pesto or other paste, top
with yogurt; if you added pesto or other paste, top with shaved
Parmesan.

Yield:  4 servings
