Title: Jasmin Tea Souffle
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Jasmin tea
3 c  Heavy cream
1 c  Milk
2    Tahitian vanilla beans
1/2 c  Honey
10    Eggs, separated
1/2 c  Cornstarch
1/4 c  Sugar for yolks
1/4 c  Sugar for whites
Bring to a simmer the cream, milk and vanilla. Add the tea and simmer
for 10 minutes. Take off stove and let steep for 20 minutes. Strain
and reheat liquid with the honey. Whisk together yolks, sugar and
cornstarch. Temper mixture with simmering liquid and put back on
stove. Reduce heat. Whisk constantly until a pastry cream consistency
is achieved, about 35 minutes. Spread base in small hotel pan, butter
the top and refrigerate. May be made
24    hours in advance.

Lift egg whites on slow speed with a little of the sugar until a wet
soft peak is reached. Add the rest of the sugar and whisk at high
speed for only 5 seconds. Transfer to stainless steel bowl and gently
fold in base at a ratio of 50/50. Bake in buttered and sugared
ramekins on preheated sheet tray at 375 for 12 minutes. Check
souffles after 6 minutes to make sure one edge is not catching. If
so, quickly open door and carefully slice the sticking side with a
sharp pairing knife. The souffle should straighten itself out. Pull
out of oven and powder sugar the souffles.
