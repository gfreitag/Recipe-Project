Categories: Try it, Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM-----------------TAMALES WORLD TOUR #WT1A23----------------------
2    (5pound) ducks
2 ts Salt
2 tb Black peppercorns, cracked
6 c  Rendered duck or pork fat
12    Garlic cloves, peeled
12    Fresh thyme sprigs
Remove ducks' legs and breasts, saving remaining bones and wings for
brown duck stock. Leaving bones and skin attached, chop breasts into
halves. With a cleaver, remove tips of drumsticks to use in stock.

Sprinkle all over with salt and pepper, and set aside at room
temperature 45 minutes. Then place duck pieces in a Dutch oven with
rendered fat, garlic and thyme. Cook over low heat, uncovered, 1 1/2
to 2 hours. To test for doneness, pierce with a sharp fork. It should
just fall off fork when shaken.

Transfer duck pieces to a medium baking dish and add the fat. Let
cool to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at
least 24 hours or as long as 4 weeks. Before serving, lift duck
pieces out of fat. Remove and discard skin and any excess fat by
warming slightly on a rack in the oven. Serve duck hot or cold.
