Preheat the grill. Season each mushroom with olive oil and Essence.
Place on the grill and grill for 3 to 4 minutes on each side.

For the sauce: In a hot saute pan, add the cream. When the cream
starts to bubble and thicken, whisk in the cheese. Season with the
garlic, salt and pepper. Simmer the sauce for 2-3 minutes.

In a pot of boiling salted and oiled water, drop in the fresh pasta
for about 2 minutes, remove, drain, and add directly to the sauce.
Remove the mushrooms and slice on the bias into 2-inch slices. Using
a pair of tongs, place three nests of pasta in the center of the
platter. Spoon the remaining sauce over the pasta and around the
plate. Arrange the mushroom around the pasta. Garnish with
hand-shaved cheese and chives.
