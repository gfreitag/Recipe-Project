Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 lb Russet or Baker's potatoes,
Preferably old, unpeeled
3/4    To 1 cup unbleached flour
2    Egg yolks
Salt to taste
Simple tomato sauce of
Choice
Freshly grated Parmesan as
An accompaniment, if
Desired
Bake potatoes 45 minutes at 375 degrees.

Remove skins and force potatoes through the medium disk of a food
mill into a bowl and beat in 3/4 to 1 cup of flour, 2 egg yolks and
salt to taste. Transfer mixture to a lightly floured board and gently
knead dough, adding additional flour, if necessary, to form a soft,
smooth but slightly sticky dough. Do not overwork dough.

Divide dough into three equal parts. Working with one piece of dough
at a time roll it into a rope about 1 inch in diameter and cut it
into 3/4-inch pieces. Gnocchi may be transferred to a lightly floured
baking sheet and chilled for 30 minutes.

The gnocchi can be cooked as is or they can be shaped.

To shape gnocchi: Using a fork with rounded long, slim tines, and
holding it parallel to counter, concave side facing you, press a
piece of dough against the inside curve of the fork just below the
prongs using your index finger. Flip dough away from tip of fork in
the direction of the fork's handle

In a large pot, bring 4 quarts water to a boil. Add salt to taste and
enough gnocchi to cook without crowding the pan. Once gnocchi have
floated to surface simmer for 10 to 15 seconds more, or until just
firm. With a slotted spoon transfer gnocchi to a bowl. Cook remaining
gnocchi in same manner and keep warm.

Divide gnocchi among serving plates and nap with tomato sauce. Serve
with freshly grated cheese.
