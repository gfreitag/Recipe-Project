Title: Red Onion Marmalade
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Extravirgin olive oil
4 lb Red onions, thinly sliced
(10 cups)
1 tb Brown sugar
Salt and white pepper, to
Taste
3/4 c  Red wine vinegar
1/2 c  Grenadine
1 1/4 c  Red wine
Heat olive oil in a large heavybottomed saucepan and add the onions.
Cook over medium heat until they begin to soften, about 10 minutes,
then add the brown sugar and stir to coat. Season with salt and
pepper. Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring frequently, until
the onions are golden brown, another 10 to 15 minutes. Add the
vinegar and grenadine and cook until it has completely evaporated,
then add the red wine and repeat the process, stirring the onions
frequently to prevent sticking and burning. When the red wine has
evaporated, taste and correct the seasoning. Remove from the heat and
keep warm (marmalade may be made up to 2 days ahead).
