Preheat the fryer. For the remoulade: In a mixing bowl, combine all
the ingredients and mix until incorporated. Season with salt and
pepper. Refrigerate until chilled, about 15 minutes, so the flavors
will marry. For the crawfish: Season the crawfish with 1 tablespoon
of Essence. In a mixing bowl, mix the masa and cornmeal together.
Season with the remaining tablespoon of Essence. Toss the crawfish in
the masa/cornmeal mixture, covering the crawfish completely. Shake
off excess coating and place directly into the fryer. Fry the
crawfish until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly.
Remove from the fryer and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season with
Essence. To assemble, slice the bread in half, spread the remoulade
on both sides of the bread. Place 1/2 of the fried crawfish on the
remoulade. Top with the chiffonade of lettuce and sliced tomatoes.
Serve with Zap Potato Chips, Abita Beer, and a bottle of Tabasco.
