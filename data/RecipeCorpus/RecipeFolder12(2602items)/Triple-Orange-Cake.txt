For the Genoise, whisk the eggs, sugar, salt, extract and zest in the
bowl of an electric mixer.  Place the bowl over a pan of gently
simmering water and whisk until the mixture is luke-warm.  Place on
mixer with whip and beat until cold and increased in volume. Combine
remaining ingredients and sift.  Remove egg mixture from mixer and
sift the starches in, folding with a rubber spatula, in 3 additions.
Pour the batter into a buttered and parchment or waxed paper-lined 10
by 2-inch diameter pan. Bake at 350 degrees about 30 minutes. Unmold
and cool on a rack.

For the syrup, combine water and sugar in a small saucepan.  Bring to
a boil over low heat.  Cool and add juice and liqueur.

For the filling, combine all ingredients except butter in mixer bowl
and whisk to mix.  Place over a pan of simmering water and whisk
constantly until hot and thickened, about 2 minutes.  Whip by machine
until cooled. Switch to paddle attachment and beat in butter.

To assemble, divide cake into 3 horizontal layers, using a sharp
serrated knife.  Place one layer on a platter or cardboard and
moisten with syrup. Spread with a third of the filling.  Repeat with
second layer, syrup and filling.  Place last layer on and moisten
with remaining syrup. Spread outside of cake smoothly with remaining
filling. Adhere almonds all over outside of cake.  Dust very lightly
with confectioners' sugar.
