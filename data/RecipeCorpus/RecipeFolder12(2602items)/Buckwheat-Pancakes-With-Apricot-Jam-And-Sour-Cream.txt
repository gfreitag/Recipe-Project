Title: Buckwheat Pancakes With Apricot Jam And Sour Cream
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Milk
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 c  Unbleached all purpose
Flour
1 c  Buckwheat flour
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
3 lg Eggs, separated
8 tb Unsalted butter, melted
2 tb Clarified unsalted butter,
Optional
Garnish:
8 tb Unsalted butter, melted
Sugar
1 c  Apricot jam, or more as
Needed, warmed
About 1 pint sour cream
Heat the milk in a small saucepan until lukewarm; remove from the
heat. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let stand until softened, 2
to 3 minutes.

Meanwhile, sift the flours, sugar and salt into a large bowl. In a
separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks until creamy; stir in the milk
mixture and the melted butter. Add to the dry ingredients and stir
just until blended. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot
until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

When the batter has risen, beat the egg whites in a medium bowl until
soft peaks form. Gently fold into the batter just until blended.

Heat a large nonstick griddle or skillet over medium heat until hot
enough to sizzle a drop of water. Brush with a thin film of vegetable
oil or clarified butter, if using. Add the batter by tablespoons for
small pancakes or use a scant 1/4 cup measure for larger pancakes.
Adjust the heat to medium low. Cook until the tops are covered with
small bubbles and the bottoms are lightly browned. Carefully turn and
lightly brown the other side.

Keep the pancakes warm on a platter covered with foil in an oven set
at the lowest temperature while you cook the remaining batter. To
serve, drizzle each serving with some of the melted butter and
sprinkle with sugar. Top with warm apricot jam and a spoonful of sour
cream.

Yield: 48 three inch pancakes
