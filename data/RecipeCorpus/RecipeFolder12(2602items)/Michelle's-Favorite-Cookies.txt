Title: Michelle's Favorite Cookies
Categories: Tvfn, Desserts
Yield: 4 servings
Piece of puff pastry 2 -
Inches wide by 8 inches long
Sugar
Liberally dust surface of the pastry and your board with sugar. Roll
pastry to about 4 inches wide and 10 inches long. (The more sugar you
manage to work into the dough, the more caramelized and scrumptious
the cookies will be.)

Press sugar over the top with a rolling pin; turn dough over and press
sugar in on the other side. Fold each long side of the pastry,
towards the middle and dust this with sugar; now fold pastry in half,
dust with sugar and gently apply pressure to the top to flatten it
out and even it up. With a knife or bench knife, cut across the
length of the dough into 3/8th-inch wide cross pieces.

Transfer cookies to a parchment lined cookie sheet. Shape the cookies
by turning edges out to approximate a bell shape or by turning edges
in. Dust with more sugar and refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat the oven
to 400 degrees. Remove cookies from the refrigerator and place the in
the oven. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until sugar on top begins to
caramelize and turn golden brown. Turn over and bake for another 5
minutes or until second side is golden (watch them carefully because
they burn easily) Cool on a rack; serve with fresh berries or oranges)

Yield: about 25 cookies
