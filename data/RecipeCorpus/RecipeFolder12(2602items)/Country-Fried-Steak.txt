Title: Country Fried Steak
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1    (1 1/2 to 2 pounds) flank
Steak
Salt and pepper
2 1/2 c  Flour
Essence
2    Eggs, beaten with 2
TB milk
Vegetable oil for frying
6 oz Finely chopped bacon
1/4 c  Minced onions
3 c  Whole milk
Cut the flank steak into four equal portions, crosswise. Using a meat
mallet, pound out the steak, about 1/4-inch. Season with salt and
pepper. Season 2 cups of the flour with Essence. Dredge the steaks in
the season flour. Dip the steaks in the egg wash, letting the excess
drip off. Dredge the steaks in the seasoned flour, coating each side
completely. Add enough oil to a large skillet to fill about 1/4-inch
of the pan. Heat the oil. When the oil is hot, carefully lay the
steaks in the hot oil. Pan-fry the steaks for 3 to 4 minutes on each
side, or until golden. Season with salt and pepper. In another
skillet, render the bacon until crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the
onions and continue to saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the
remaining 1/2 cup of flour and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Season
with salt and black pepper. Whisk in the milk and bring the liquid to
a simmer, cook the gravy for 3 to 4 minutes. If the gravy is too
thick add a little more milk and if too thin, cook a little longer.
Remove from the heat and season with salt an black pepper. Spoon the
gravy over each steak.
