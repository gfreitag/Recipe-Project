Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1/2    Recipe pie dough (bottom
Crust only)
2 pt Huckleberries
1 c  Granulated sugar
3 tb Cornstarch
1/2 ts Grated fresh ginger root
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
Juice and the grated zest of
1    Orange
Juice and grated zest of 1
Lemon
1/2 c  Dayold pound cake crumbs
1/2 c  Chopped pecans
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
3 ts Ground cinnamon
1    Stick (8 tablespoons)
Unsalted butter
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Roll the pie dough out to the size
and shape of a 10-inch pie tin. Lay the dough into the pan and prick
the bottom with the tines of a fork. Place a sheet of waxed paper
over the pie dough and weigh it down with pie dough weights or clean
dry beans, and blind bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Remove
from the oven and cool thoroughly.

Combine the berries, sugar, cornstarch, spices, citrus juice and zest
in a bowl and mix well. Sprinkle the cake crumbs on the bottom of the
prebaked pie crust. Fill the pie shell with the berry mixture and
bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes.

While the pie is baking, combine the dry ingredients for the pecan
crunch. Cut the butter into little cubes, add to the dry mixture and,
with the palms of your hands, rub together to form large nuggets as
big as peanuts, no larger than walnuts.

After the pie has baked for 15 minutes, sprinkle the crunch all over
the top, reduce the oven heat to 350 degrees and bake an additional
45 minutes. If the crunch begins to darken too quickly, cover with
aluminum foil. Cool the pie for at least an 2 hours before serving.

Yield: 1 10-inch pie
