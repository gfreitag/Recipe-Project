Title: Tortino Di Carciofi Faith Willinger
Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Extra virgin olive oil
1 lb Baby artichokes, peeled,
Cleaned and sliced paper
Thin, resting in
Acidulated water
6    Jumbo eggs
1/2 c  Freshly grated Pecorino
In a nonstick saute pan, heat the oil until just smoking. Drain the
artichokes and pat them dry with towels. Saute the artichokes a
handful at a time until they are golden brown. Continue until all are
done.

Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a bowl and just break the yolks. Do not
whisk or stir. Add cheese and let stand. When all the artichokes are
done, place them all back in the pan. Pour the eggs over the
artichokes and swirl the pan to allow the eggs to drip through and
make contact with the pan. Cook until the eggs set, about 5 to 6
minutes. Toss onto a plate and serve.
