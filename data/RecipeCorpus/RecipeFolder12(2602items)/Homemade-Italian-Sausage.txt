Title: Homemade Italian Sausage
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
5 lb Pork shoulder
1 c  Cold water
2 tb Salt
1 tb Ground black pepper
2 tb Fennel seeds
1/2 c  Grated pecorino romano
Cheese
1/2 c  Chopped parsley
1/2 lb Hog sausage casing
Trim the meat of all gristle but remember to not trim too much fat as
the mixture should be approximately 80 percent lean to 20 percent
fat. Cut the meat into chunks and pass through a meat grinder using
the largest die. Pass the meat through again, this time using the
medium die. Pass the sausage meat through one more time on this
medium die.

In a large bowl mix the ground meat with the water, salt, pepper,
fennel seed, cheese and parsley.

Wash the casing well under cold running water and allow water to run
through the casing so that any holes may be detected. Fit the grinder
with the sausage stuffing attachment and place the casing over the
stuffing tube by feeding it on and bunching it up on the tube..

Place the meat in the hopper on top and begin to push the sausage
meat down into the hopper so that it begins to feed into the casing.
As the meat feeds into the casing, allow the casing to slide into
your open hand. Catch the stuffed sausage as it comes out of the
machine. Go at a slow and steady pace so that the sausage is fully,
evenly, stuffed and without air pockets. To make individual links,
twist the sausage every few inches as it is stuffed and let the
finished ring of sausage lay on the work space as you finish the
process. Continue until the meat is finished. Keep refrigerated and
use with in one week or freeze for later use.

Yield: approximately 5 pounds finished sausage
