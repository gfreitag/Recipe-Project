Title: Quick Puff Pastry (Adapted From Julia Child)
Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
Flour, plus extra for
Rolling dough
1 c  Bleached cake flour
1 1/2 ts Salt
6 1/2    Sticks (1 pound 10 ounces)
Unsalted butter, each stick
Cut into 16 to
20 sm Pieces, chilled
About 1 cup ice water
On work surface, preferably a large marble board, measure out flours
and salt and combine. Add chilled butter all at once, tossing to coat
pieces in flour. Mixing rapidly with your hands, flatten butter into
lima bean size pieces. Begin adding ice water, a few drops at a time,
lifting and turning dough until it begins to come together. Using a
dough scraper pat dough into a rough rectangle, 18-inches long and
about 6-inches wide, with short side facing you. Dough will be messy
and unmanageable. If butter softens too much during initial mixing,
transfer entire work surface to refrigerator and chill.

When dough has come together in a rough rectangle, fold bottom third
up to middle, then fold top third over both layers, as if you were
folding a letter. Scrape any excess dough to side and flour work
surface well. Turn dough package 90 degrees to right, so top layer of
dough could open like a book. Using a floured rolling pin, roll dough
vertically into another 18x6-inch rectangle, with short side facing
you. Fold again in thirds. Wrap dough in wax paper and refrigerate at
least 20 minutes until dough is firm enough to roll again. Turn 90
degrees to right. This is the second turn.

Repeat rolling out, folding and turning 4 more times, refrigerating
again after the 3rd and 5th turns; after 5th turn, chill at least 45
minutes, if possible. Dough can be made ahead up to this point and
refrigerated for 2 days, or frozen. After 6th turn, dough is ready to
roll out into desired shape.

Yield: About 2 3/4 pounds dough, enough to roll out to a 1/4-inch
thick 12x36-inch rectangle
