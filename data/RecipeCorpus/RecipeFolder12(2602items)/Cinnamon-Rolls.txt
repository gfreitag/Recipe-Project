Consistency
In a bowl dissolve yeast in water. In another bowl combine sugar and
eggs. Add the melted shortening, butter and milk. Add yeasted water
and stir to combine. In a large bowl stir flour and salt together.
Add flour a cup at a time to yeast mixture and mix until thoroughly
incorporated. Knead mixture until semi-smooth. Transfer dough to a
buttered bowl, cover and place in a warm spot to rise for one hour.

Roll out dough in a rectangle (approximately 24 inches x 10 inches)
and to a thickness of 1/4 - 1/2-inch. Brush dough with melted butter.
In a bowl combine sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle mixture
over melted butter, covering all the dough. Along long side of
rectangle roll dough up, like a rug. Trim ends and slice roll into 16
1 1/2-inch rounds. Dip both sides of rounds in cinnamon-sugar mixture
and arrange on greased sheet pan or in 2 buttered large cast-iron
frying pans, cover and let rise for 30-40 minutes. In a bowl whisk
together powdered sugar, vanilla and milk, cover and set aside.

Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden. Cool for 5
minutes and drizzle with glaze, if desired.
