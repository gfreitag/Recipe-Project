Title: Stewed Chaurice
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Olive oil
2 c  Chopped onions
2    Crushed bay leaves
2 tb Garlic
1 c  Chopped green bell peppers
1/2 lb Baby carrots, peeled
1/2 lb New potatoes, quartered
Salt and pepper
1 c  Dry red wine
3 c  Veal stock or any dark
Stock
2 lb Fresh chaurice patties
1 tb Chopped parsley
1    Loaf of crusty Portuguese
Bread
In a braising pan, over medium heat, add the oil. When the oil is hot
add the onions and crushed bay leaves. Fry the onions in the oil
until golden about 3 to 4 minutes. Season the onions with salt and
pepper. Stir in the garlic, peppers, and carrots. Continue to saute
for 2 minutes. Add the potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in
the stock. Place the patties of sausage in the center of the
vegetables. Add the red wine. The stock should come up to 2/3 of the
way up the sausage. So, add the stock slowly. Save the reserved stock
to add during braising. Bring the liquid to a boil and reduce to a
simmer. Simmer the sausage for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the
vegetables are tender and the sauce has a gravy like consistency. Add
the remaining stock about every 30 minutes. Ladle the stew into bowls
and serve with crusty bread. Garnish with parsley.
