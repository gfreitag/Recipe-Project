Season the pork with Essence.  In a saute pan, heat the olive oil.
When the oil is hot, sear the chops for 5 minutes on each side.
Remove the chops from the pan and set aside.  Stir in the flour
stirring constantly, for a dark brown roux, about 3 minutes.  Add the
onions and saute for 5 minutes, or until wilted.  Stir in the garlic,
pecans and water. Season with salt and cayenne.  Bring the liquid up
to a boil. Add the sweet potatoes and blend to make the sauce smooth.
Stir in the cane syrup and green onions. Return the chops to the pan
and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, basting the
chops with the gravy.
