Title: Chocolate Chip Cheesecake
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Sliced almonds, toasted
2 1/2 lb Cream cheese, softened
1    Cup, plus 2 tablespoons
Sugar
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 1/2 ts Grated lemon zest
1/3 c  Fresh lemon juice
3    Eggs
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate,
Coarsely chopped
3 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
Melted
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Butter a 9inch round cake pan and
line the bottom and sides with almonds.

With an electric mixer at low speed, beat cream cheese until soft and
smooth.  With machine running, add sugar, cinnamon, lemon zest, and
juice, beating well between additions.  Add eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each addition.  Beat in vanilla.  To ensure even
mixing, be sure to scrape down the bowl between additions.  Fold in
the chopped chocolate evenly.  Pour batter into lined cake pan.  Tap
it 3 or 4 times on the counter to eliminate air pockets.  Place
inside a larger pan and pour in boiling water until it rises halfway
up the sides of the cake pan. Bake about 45 minutes, until center
feels firm when pressed.

Set aside to cool on a rack, then refrigerate 2 to 3 hours.  To
unmold, place pan over a low burner about 2 minutes.  Invert onto a
platter, then invert again (the nuts should be on the bottom).  The
cake can be kept in the refrigerator up to 2 days.  At least two or
up to eight hours before serving, top with the melted chocolate: Dip
your fingers or a fork into the melted chocolate and drizzle over the
center in a freeform pattern. Refrigerate until serving time.
