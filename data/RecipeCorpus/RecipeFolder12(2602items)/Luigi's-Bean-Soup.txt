Title: Luigi's Bean Soup
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Dried navy beans
2    Medium-sized tomatoes,
Coarsely chopped
2    Scallions, coarsely chopped
2 tb Olive oil
1    Stalk celery, coarsely
Chopped
3    To 4 large cloves garlic,
Coarsely chopped
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1    To 2 branches basil (1/4 cup
Loosely packed leaves)
1 1/2 ts Salt
Garnish and accompaniments:
Freshly grated Parmesan or
Aged goat cheese, freshly
Ground black pepper
You will need a large pot with a lid.  Rinse beans in cold water to
clean, then place in large saucepan, cover with 3 to 4-inches of cold
water and bring to a boil.  Skim off any foam, drain off water, and
cover beans again with cold water to a depth of 3 to 4-inches. Put
back on heat. As water heats, add tomatoes, scallions, oil, celery,
garlic, black pepper, and basil.  Cover and bring to a boil. Lower
heat and simmer covered for 2 to 3 hours, until beans are cooked and
tender. Check beans every so often to ensure that they aren't running
dry. Add more water if necessary. Once beans are cooked, add salt,
and bring back to a rolling boil for 3 to 5 minutes to thicken.  Set
aside until ready to serve, then reheat, and transfer to serving
dish.  Serve hot, topped with a sprinkling of grated cheese and of
freshly ground black pepper.  Put out pepper and extra cheese so
guests can adjust flavorings as they wish.

Yield: 4 to 5 cups thick soup. Serves 2 as a main course and 4 or 5
as part of a larger meal.
