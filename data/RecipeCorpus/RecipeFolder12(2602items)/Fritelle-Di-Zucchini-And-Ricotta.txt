Title: Fritelle Di Zucchini And Ricotta
Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 md Small zucchinis, rinsed and
Dried
2    Cloves garlic, thinly
Sliced
1/2 c  Scallions, thinly sliced
1/2 c  Sardegna sheep's milk
Ricotta
1    To 2 tablespoons black
Pepper, freshly ground
Zest of 2 lemons
3    Eggs
3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Olive oil
Grate the zucchini with a hand grater into a mixing bowl. Add garlic,
scallions and ricotta and stir to mix well. Add pepper, lemon zest
and eggs and stir through. Add flour, three to four tablespoons at a
time, stirring constantly to avoid lumps, until all flour is mixed
in. In a 12 to 14-inch frying pan, heat oil until 375 degrees F, or
just under the smoking point. Scoop 1/8 cup of zucchini mixture and
gently drop into the hot oil. Being careful not to crowd the pan, add
three to four more similar-sized scoops. Cook until golden brown,
about 45 seconds, and flip with a spatula. Continue cooking until all
are done. Drain each on paper towels before placing on serving
platter with lemon wedges and a radicchio salad.
