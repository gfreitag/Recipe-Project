Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Unsalted butter
2 c  Small mushroom caps
2    Carrots, cut into 1/2 inch
Rounds
1 tb Caraway seeds
1 tb Paprika
Half of leftover beef stew
2 lb Potatoes, cut into 1 inch
Cubes or chunks
1/4 c  Sour cream, optional
Chopped parsley and diced
Kosher dill pickles, for
Garnish
In a large casserole, over medium high heat, melt the butter.  When
the foaming subsides, add the mushrooms and saute for a minute until
they begin to soften.  Add the carrots, caraway seeds, paprika, 1/4
cup water, cover and simmer just for 4 to 5 minutes or until the
vegetables are just tender.

Add the leftover stew, cover and simmer 10 minutes just to reheat and
bring flavors together.  Meanwhile parboil the potatoes until tender
but not falling apart.  Season to the stew to taste with salt and
pepper, remove from heat and stir in the sour cream if you wish.
Center potatoes in a deep platter and surround them with the stew;
garnish potatoes with parsley and meat with pickles.
