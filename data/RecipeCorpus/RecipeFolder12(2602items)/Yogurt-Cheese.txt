Title: Yogurt Cheese
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Plain nonfat yogurt, no
Gelatin added
Put the yogurt in a strainer over a bowl.  Or you can use a coffee
filter, piece of muslin, or a paper towel and place it in a small
sieve over a bowl.  Cover and let it drain in the refrigerator for 12
hours or overnight.  It becomes quite firm and the small lumps
disappear, which makes it ideal for use in sauces.  The liquid whey
drains into the bowl, leaving you with thick, creamy yogurt cheese.
