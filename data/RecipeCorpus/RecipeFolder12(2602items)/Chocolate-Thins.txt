Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
8 tb Unsalted butter, at room
Temperature
3/4 c  Sugar
1    Egg, separated
1 ts Vanilla
2/3 c  Sifted flour
1/3 c  Cocoa
1/2 ts Cinnamon
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Butter a 14 x 18 inch baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of the butter.
Cream the remaining butter with 1/2 cup of the sugar until light and
fluffy. Beat in the egg yolk and vanilla.  Mix in the sifted flour
and cocoa. Using your fingers, which have been run under cold water
and dried, spread the batter over the baking sheet, completely
covering it to the edges. Beat the egg white until stiff and spread
it over the batter. Combine the cinnamon with the remaining 1/4 cup
sugar, and sprinkle it over the egg white. Bake for about 10 minutes.
Remove from the oven and immediately cut the pastry into about 24
diamond, square, or oblong shapes.  With a metal spatula, carefully
remove the cookies from the sheet and cool.

Yield: about 24 cookies
