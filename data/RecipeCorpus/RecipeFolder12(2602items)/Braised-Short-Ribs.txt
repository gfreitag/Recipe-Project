Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 1/2 lb Short ribs, cut into
Individual ribs
2 tb Creole seasoning
1 c  Chopped onions
1/2 c  Chopped celery
1/2 c  Chopped carrot
1 c  Peeled, seeded and chopped
Fresh or canned tomatoes
2 tb Chopped garlic
1/2 c  Red wine vinegar

3    Bay leaves
2 ts Black pepper
2 qt Beef broth
1/4 c  Chopped scallion (green part
Only), for sprinkling
Heat oil in a dutch oven or large, heavy covered pot over high heat.
Season ribs with Creole seasoning, patting it in well with your
hands. When pot is nearly smoking add ribs without crowding them and
sear on all sides until they form a brown crust. Do this in batches,
if necessary. When all ribs have browned, add onions, celery and
carrot; saute 1 minute to brown lightly. Stir in tomatoes, garlic,
vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, pepper and enough broth to
just cover ribs. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to gently simmering,
cover and simmer until very tender, about 2 1/2 hours.

To serve, mound ribs in center of 4 plates, spoon sauce over and
garnish with chopped scallion.
