Title: Beans Meanz Fitz
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Shelled, fresh, young broad
Beans
Olive oil
Lemon juice
Salt
Black pepper, freshly
Ground
6    Strips of bacon, cut into
Little strips
4    Hard-boiled eggs, peeled and
Left in cold water
Parsley
Chives
1 1/2    Tins anchovy fillets
Make a dressing with about 1/4 pint of the best olive oil, adding
lemon juice and seasoning to taste: keep it quite tart. For easy
mixing, make it in a screwtop jar. Grill or fry the bacon until crisp
and drain on paper towels. Put the beans into boiling salted water
and cook until just tender; drain and refresh under cold running
water. Pat the eggs dry and chop roughly together with parsley and
chives.

Lay the beans in some ravishing china dish, sprinkle with the bacon,
pile the eggs and herbs on next and lattice the top with the anchovy
fillets. Chill slightly. Just before serving, give the dressing a
good shake and drizzle over the beans. Bring to the table with some
good crusty bread and unsalted butter.
