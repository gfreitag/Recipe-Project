Title: Lemon Blueberry Puff Tart
Categories: Baker, Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
Sheet tray of 3/8-inch thick
Puff, frozen
2/3 c  Fresh squeezed strained
Lemon juice
1/2 c  Sugar
3    Eggs
2    Egg yolks
1 c  Blueberries
Whisk the juice, sugar eggs and yolks together in a pot, being
careful not to aerate it too much.  Cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly but gently with the whisk.  Cook until it thickens and the
whisk leaves light lines; it will still be quite liquid.  Do not let
it boil. Strain it into a bowl and press plastic wrap onto the hot
surface.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Invert a 10-inch cake pan over the
dough (towards the edge of the tray so you waste a minimum amount of
dough) and press.  Lift off and use a pizza cutter to cut around the
imprint of the circle.  Lift the circle of dough out and place on a
cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  Dock it.  Center the round
metal bottom of 9-inch tart mold over the dough and press.  Cut
around at 1-inch intervals to form a decorative "fringe".  Weigh the
metal bottom down with heavy objects. (I place an 8-inch cake pan on
top and fill it with stacked tartlet molds - about 3 1/2 pounds
worth.)

Bake about 18 minutes, until the edges are golden, then remove the
weights and metal tart bottom.  Reduce heat to 350 degrees F. and
bake for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the center is golden.  Remove
from oven and spread the lemon curd evenly in the center.  Put back
in the oven for 2 to 3 minutes to set the filling.  Remove from oven
and scatter the berries around the outside edge of the lemon filling.
Serve within an hour. Cut with a pizza wheel.
