Title: Stuffed Roasted Pepper "Sandwiches"
Categories:
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM----------------CHEF DU JOUR JULIA DELLA CRO---------------------
6 lg Red or yellow bell peppers
6    Thin slices of prosciutto
6    Thin slices of Fontina
Olive oil for brushing on
Peppers
Arrange the peppers on a grill rack above a charcoal fire, on wire
racks positioned over the burners of a gas or electric stove, 2 to 3
inches under a preheated broiler, or in an oven preheated to 400
degrees F. Roast them until they are charred all over and tender
inside, turning them frequently to insure they cook evenly, about 25
minutes in the oven, but less time by the other methods. Remove them
from the oven but leave the oven on. When the peppers are cool enough
to handle, using a sharp knife, cut them in half vertically, like a
sandwich. Care should be taken not to break the skin. Carefully
remove the stem and lift off the skin. Remove all of the seeds.

Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F.

Place a slice each of prosciutto and fontina on the inside of one
half of each pepper. Replace the matching half over the filling.
Brush lightly with olive oil and place on a foil-lined baking sheet.
Use two baking sheets if necessary. Place the peppers in the oven,
placing the baking sheet(s) on the middle rack. Cook until the cheese
is melted and the peppers are heated through, about 15 minutes. Serve
hot or warm
