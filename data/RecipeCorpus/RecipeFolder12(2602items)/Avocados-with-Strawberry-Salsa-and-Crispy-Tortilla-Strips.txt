For strawberry salsa:

Wearing rubber gloves, remove stems, seeds, and ribs from chili and
chop fine.

In a bowl stir together chili and remaining salsa ingredients. Salsa
may be made several hours ahead and chilled, covered.

Stack tortillas and cut them in half. Cut stacks crosswise into
1/2-inch-thick strips and in a heavy skillet heat 1/2 inch oil over
moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Working in two batches, fry
tortilla strips until crisp and golden, about 30 seconds, and with a
slotted spoon transfer to

paper towels to drain. Sprinkle fried tortilla strips with salt to
taste.

Halve the avocado, removing the pit, and peel. Slice each half
lengthwise into 6 wedges. Slice chicken into 6 wedges and fan ,with
the avocado, onto 2 plates.

Spoon about 1/2 cup strawberry salsa over each fan and mound crispy
tortilla strips alongside.

Yield: 2 servings
