Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Large shrimp, peeled and
Deveined, butterflied, tails
Left on,
Patted dry
1 c  All purpose flour
1 c  Vegetable oil
2 c  Dry white wine
1 c  Chicken broth
Juice of 1 lemon
2 ts Minced garlic
2 ts Chopped, fresh oregano or 1
ts Dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 c  Freshly grated Pecorino
Romano cheese
Approximately 8 tablespoons
Unsalted butter
1 c  Bread crumbs
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Dredge shrimp in flour, patting them to
make sure all sides are well coated. Heat oil in a large saute pan
over high heat. When oil is very hot but not smoking, add shrimp and
saute for 3 minutes or until shrimp have just begun to brown. Do not
crowd pan; prepare shrimp in batches, if necessary. Remove shrimp
from pan and drain off all excess oil.

Return pan to medium high heat. Add shrimp, wine, broth, lemon juice,
garlic, oregano, and salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and cook for 1
minute.

Using a slotted spoon, remove shrimp from pan and place on a cookie
sheet with sides. Pour sauce over the top of the shrimp. Sprinkle
cheese over each shrimp. Place 1/2 teaspoon butter on each shrimp,
then generously coat the tops with bread crumbs. Bake for 3 minutes.
Transfer shrimp to broiler for 1 minute or until tops are brown.
Serve.
