In a mixing bowl, whip the egg whites slightly. Combine the lean meat,
vegetables, tomato puree, herbs, and spices together. Mix in the egg
whites. In a spigot stock pot, blend the cold chicken stock with the
meat mixture. Place the stock pot on medium heat. Stir the liquid
occasionally until the raft forms. (the liquid should reach 160
degrees F) Simmer the soup for 1 1/2 hours, making sure the raft does
not break or sink. Remove the first cup of the consommé from the
spigot to remove sediment and discard. Line a china cap with 5 layers
of cheesecloth. Strain the liquid slowly. If the liquid is cloudy,
strain the consommé again with fresh cheesecloth. Season with salt,
hot sauce, and garnishes.
