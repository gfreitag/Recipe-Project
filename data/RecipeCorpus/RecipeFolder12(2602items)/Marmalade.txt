Title: Marmalade
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 lb Oranges, preferably Seville
1    Lemon
2 1/4 c  Water
2 1/2 c  Sugar
Wash the oranges and lemon, cut in half and squeeze out the juice.
Remove the membrane with a spoon, put it with the seeds, and tie them
in a piece of cheesecloth.  Soak the bundle for 30 minutes in cold
water. Slice the peel finely.  Put the peel, orange and lemon juice,
bundle of seeds, and the 2 1/4 cups water in a nonaluminum bowl or
saucepan and leave overnight. Bring everything to a boil, reduce heat
to low and simmer gently for about 1 hour, until the peel is very
soft and liquid is reduced by half. Squeeze all the liquid from the
cheesecloth bundle and discard it. Add the sugar and stir until
dissolved.  Increase the heat, bring to a boil, and cook until the
jell point, about 5 to 10 minutes.  To test the jell point, a sugar
thermometer should register 220 degrees F, or put a little marmalade
on a cold saucer and place in freezer for a minute. The marmalade
should feel set and wrinkle when you push it.  Pour into sterilized
jars. Cover, seal and store in a cool, dark place.

Yield: about 1 1/2 pounds
