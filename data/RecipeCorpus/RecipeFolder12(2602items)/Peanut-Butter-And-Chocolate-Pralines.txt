Title: Peanut Butter And Chocolate Pralines
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Sugar
1 c  (packed) light brown sugar
1/2 c  Melted semi-sweet chocolate
1/2 c  Sweetened condensed milk
2 tb Corn syrup
1 tb Butter
pn Salt
3 tb Creamy peanut butter
1 1/2 c  Pecan pieces
In a heavy saucepan, over medium heat, combine all of the ingredients
except the pecan pieces. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Continue to
cook, stirring, until the mixture begins to bubble around the edges
of the pan, about 12 minutes. Add the pecans and continue to stir
until mixture thickens, about 8 minutes, and reaches 234 to 240
degrees F on a candy thermometer, or the soft ball stage, that is,
when a bit dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens.
Remove from the heat and drop by the tablespoonful onto waxed paper.
Let cool and lift the pralines with a thin knife.

Yield: 1 1/2 dozen
