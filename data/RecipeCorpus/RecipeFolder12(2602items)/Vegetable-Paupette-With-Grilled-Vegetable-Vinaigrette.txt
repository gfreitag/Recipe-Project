Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

For the paupette: Toss all the vegetables with the basil, black
olives, olive oil and salt and pepper. Layer the mixture in the
center on one half side of the parchment. Add the 1 tablespoon of
water for steaming purposes. Fold the other half of parchment over
the vegetables resembling a book. With the crease side toward you
start crimping and folding towards your body. The finish product will
resemble a calzone. Make sure that the parchment is nice and tight,
so that none of the liquid will escape. Roast for 8-10 minutes.

For vinaigrette: In a mixing bowl, slowly whisk the balsamic vinegar
into the olive oil. Add the brunoise of vegetables and season with
salt and pepper. Remove the paupette from the oven and place on a
plate. Make a cut through the top center, exposing the roasted
vegetables. Spoon the vinaigrette over the vegetables and garnish
with 2 grilled green onions.
