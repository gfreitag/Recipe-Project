Title: Roasted Potatoes With Garlic
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
Or Fingerling potatoes
1/4 c  Olive oil
3 tb Unsalted butter
3    Cloves garlic, peeled and
Finely minced
2 tb Chopped fresh thyme
2 tb Chopped fresh flatleaf
Parsley
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper to taste
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Leaving their skins on, scrub the potatoes with a brush to remove any
dirt or blemishes.  Dry the potatoes with paper towels or a cloth.
Leave whole, cut in half or in quarters, depending on the size of the
potatoes. Pour the olive oil into a roasting pan or large cast iron
skillet and heat in a 350 degree oven for ten minutes before adding
the potatoes. Roast the potatoes for 45 minutes, until crisp. Shake
the pan several times during cooking, so that the potatoes roll
around to brown evenly.  Remove from the oven. Drain the potatoes on
paper towels or a cloth to absorb the excess oil, then place in a
serving dish.

In a saute pan, melt the butter, add the garlic, and saute until light
goldenbrown.  Add the chopped herbs to the garlic butter, stir
together quickly, and remove from the heat.  Pour the garlic herb
butter over the potatoes, season with salt and pepper, and serve.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings
