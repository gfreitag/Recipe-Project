Title: Summer Berry Sundae
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
Lemon Curd---
1    Egg plus 2 egg yolks
1/2 c  Freshly squeezed, strained,
Lemon juice (about 2
Lemons)
Grated zest of 2 lemons
1/2 c  Sugar
Summer Berry Simmer---
2 1/2 c  Mixed berries: strawberries
Cut in quarters, blueberries
Raspberries, blackberries,
Plus a few extra berries
For garnish
2 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Water
2 ts Pure vanilla extract
1 pt Premium vanilla ice cream
Make the lemon curd:

In a medium saucepan, whisk together the egg and the yolks, lemon
juice, lemon zest and sugar. Set over very low heat and, stirring
gently and constantly with a rubber spatula, cook until it thickens,
about 5 minutes. It will be just ready to boil. Don't let it. Strain
into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside to cool to room
temperature.

Cook the berries:

In a medium saucepan, toss the strawberries and blueberries with the
sugar and water. Wash the side of the pot down with a wet pastry
brush and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the
sugar is dissolved and the berries are soft but still intact, about 2
minutes. If the sugar hasn't dissolved, add a few more drops of
water. Stir in the vanilla extract. Remove the pot from the heat and
add the more delicate berries. Do not stir; let the residual heat
soften them. Transfer to a bowl to cool.

Assemble the sundae:

Add about a tablespoon of the berries to the bottom of 4 sundae
glasses. Add a dollop of lemon curd to that and then spoon about 1/2
cup of ice cream into each glass. Blanket the ice cream with more
lemon curd and berries. Garnish with a few uncooked berries.
