Title: Marie's Brown Soda Bread
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
15 oz Whole-wheat flour
5 oz Plain white flour
2 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
3 oz Soft butter
1/2 pt Buttermilk
1 oz Sunflower seeds
In a large bowl mix together the two flours, sugar, salt, and baking
soda. Rub in the butter with your fingers until the mixture resembles
fine bread crumbs. Make a center well and pour in buttermilk. Mix
again and shape into a round cake. Sprinkle with sunflower seeds.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in a 400-degree oven. Test by inserting a
long wooden skewer into the center of the bread. If it comes out
clean the bread is cooked. If tapped on the bottom, it should sound
hollow. Take out and cool on a wire tray.

This is an old recipe given to my wife, Marie Deering, by her mother.
The sunflower seeds are a recent embellishment.
