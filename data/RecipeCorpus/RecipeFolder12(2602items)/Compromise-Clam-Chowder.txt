If using fresh clams, shuck them over a bowl to catch their juices.
Measure 2 cups of juices, transfer to a small saucepan and heat just
to boiling. Meanwhile, in a soup pot heat butter over medium-high
heat, add leeks, celery and pepper and saute, stirring, for 10
minutes, without browning. Reduce heat and whisk in flour. Cook,
stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Whisk in boiling clam juice and
fish or chicken stock and heat to simmering. Add potatoes. Squeeze
tomatoes with your hands into soup pot. Stir in thyme leaves. Simmer
for 20 minutes.

In a food processor blend 2/3 cup of clams to a puree; coarsely chop
remaining 1 1/3 cups clams. When ready to serve, reduce soup to barely
simmering and vigorously stir in pureed clams. In a small saucepan
combine coarsely-chopped clams with a ladleful of chowder and heat
for 20 seconds over low heat. Divide chowder among soup bowls and top
each portion with some chopped clams. Garnish with thyme sprigs.
