Title: Petit Cheddar Biscuits
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Unbleached flour
2 tb Toasted wheat germ
4    Level teaspoons baking
Powder
1/2 ts Salt
6 tb Cubed cold butter
1/4 c  Grated sharp Cheddar cheese
(1-ounce)
3/4 c  Buttermilk
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Butter a baking sheet. In the bowl
of a mixer or food processor, combine the flour, wheat germ, baking
powder, and salt and process briefly to combine. Add the butter and
cheese and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Pour in
the buttermilk, then process until the dough comes together, about 15
seconds. Turn the dough out onto a floured board and allow it to rest
for 5 minutes. Knead 3 times only, then pat into a circle 3/4-inch
thick. Cut into petite biscuits, using a 1-inch biscuit cutter. Place
the dough circles on the baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes in the
upper third of the oven, until puffed and golden. Yield: about 3 dozen
