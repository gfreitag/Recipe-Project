Title: Smoked Beef Brisket
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
Hickory chips
1    Whole 10 pound beef brisket,
Untrimmed

Soak the chips in water for a couple of hours, and then drain. Place
the chips in the tray. Season the entire brisket with Rustic Rub.
Place the brisket in the smoker and smoke at 350 degrees F for 4
hours. Reduce the heat to 125 degrees F and continue to smoke for 8
hours. Place a drip pan underneath the brisket to catch some of the
drippings to use for the BBQ sauce. Remove the brisket from the
smoker. With a sharp knife, trim off the outer thin black skin.
Divide the brisket in two pieces and trim off all the fat. Slice the
brisket very thin and serve with the BBQ sauce.
