Title: Apple Fritters
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Butter
2 tb Brown sugar
Juice of one lemon
1/4 c  Water
2 c  Chopped apples
Splash apple brandy
1/4 ts Cinnamon
2    Eggs, separated
2/3 c  Milk
1 tb Melted butter
1 c  Sifted flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
Drizzle of Steen's 100
Percent Pure Cane Syrup
Shaker of powdered sugar
Preheat the fryer. In a saucepan, melt the butter. Stir in the brown
sugar and cook for 30 seconds to dissolve the sugar. Add the lemon
juice, water, apples, brandy and cinnamon. Cook the apples for about
3 to 5 minutes or until the apples start to wilt. Remove from the
heat and cool completely. In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks,
milk, melted butter and cooled apple mixture. Stir in the dry
ingredients into the liquid mixture. Blend until the batter is
incorporated. Cover the batter, place in the refrigerator and let
rest for 2 to 4 hours. In a standing mixer or with a whisk, beat egg
whites until stiff. Remove the batter from the refrigerator and blend
until smooth. Fold in the beaten egg whites. Using a large spoon,
drop the batter into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 3
to 4 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on paper-lined plate. To
serve, Mound the warm fritters on a platter and drizzle with cane
syrup. Garnish the fritters with powdered sugar.
