In a baking pan toast walnuts in one layer in middle of oven 10 to 15
minutes, or until lightly colored, and cool completely. Mince garlic
and discard stems from spinach.

Have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. In a 3-quart kettle

In a food processor pulse walnuts just until finely ground. Add

until smooth. Filling may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.
