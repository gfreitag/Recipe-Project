and fully incorporated. Turn the crust into a mixing bowl. For the
chops: Season each chop with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and Essence.
Place on the grill. Grill on each side for 2 minutes. The chops are
being grilled for searing and marking only, not to cook them. Allow
the chops to cool completely.

Rub each chop with the melted chocolate and cover with the nut crust,
covering the entire chop completely. In a saute pan, heat the
remaining olive oil. When the pan is smoking hot, add the chops. Sear
on one side for 3 minutes. Turn the chops over and place in the oven.
Cook for 10-12 minutes for medium. In a deep fryer, cook julienned
sweet potatoes until crispy and golden, about 1 minute. Set aside for
garnish.
