Make marinade:

In a large saucepan combine wine, garlic, bay leaves, dried rosemary,
thyme, zest, and peppercorns and simmer 10 minutes. Remove pan from
heat and cool marinade completely, uncovered.

In a large bowl pour marinade over short ribs. Marinate ribs, covered
and chilled, 24 hours.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Transfer meat with tongs to a plate and
pour marinade through a large sieve set over a kettle. Boil marinade
until reduces by about one fourth. In a 4-quart heavy ovenproof
kettle heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking
and saute onion, celery, and carrot 6 minutes, or until golden brown.
Sprinkle vegetables with flour and cook over moderately low heat,
stirring, 3 minutes. To vegetables add broth and marinade, whisking,
and bring to a simmer. Add meat and bring to a simmer. Braise meat,
covered, in middle of oven 3 hours, or until it pulls away from bones
and is tender. Transfer meat with a slotted spoon to a platter,
discarding bones and gristle, and keep warm, covered.

Pour sauce through a very fine sieve into a large saucepan and add
olives. Simmer sauce, uncovered, 20 minutes, or until thickened
slightly and coats back of a spoon. Add meat and heat over moderate
heat until heated through. Garnish daube with rosemary sprigs.
