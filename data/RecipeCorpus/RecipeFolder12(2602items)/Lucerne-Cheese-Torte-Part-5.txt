Title: Lucerne Cheese Torte Part 5
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
---Assembling the Dessert---
Place the shell of the cake on a cardboard round for easier handling.
Using pastry brush, coat evenly with a third (or less) of the dessert
syrup inside the entire shell.  Spoon half of the filling into the
shell, and smooth it to level.  Place one of the thin cake layers on
the filling, and gently press so it adheres. Brush this layer with
dessert syrup. Spoon the rest of the filling over this Then place the
top layer of cake over the filling, and brush with the remaining
third (or less) of the syrup. Gently press the top layer down with
your fingers until level with the edge. It now looks the way it did
before the core was cut:  a layer cake with no filling Cover the cake
with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 4 hours to allow
the filling to thicken.
