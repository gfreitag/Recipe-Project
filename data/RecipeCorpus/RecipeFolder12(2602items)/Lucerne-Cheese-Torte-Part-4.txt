Title: Lucerne Cheese Torte Part 4
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
4 oz Cream cheese, room
Temperature
3 tb Unsalted butter, room
Temperature
1 tb Sour cream
1 ts Lemon zest
2 lg Egg yolks
2 tb Water
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  Heavy cream
In a 2 to 3 quart mixing bowl, manipulate the cream cheese with a
rubber spatula until smooth. Gradually add the butter, stirring until
smooth and homogeneous. Lastly, stir in the sour cream and lemon
zest; set aside. Place the egg yolks in the bowl of a heavy-duty
mixer and with the whisk attachment, whip them on medium speed (#5)
until light in color and fluffy in texture (about 2 minutes). Detach
whisk and remove bowl; set whisk close by to use later. Combine the
water and sugar in a heavybottomed saucepan or sugar pot. Place over
low heat, swirling the pot occasionally to distribute heat until the
sugar completely dissolves (about 2 minutes). Keep a pastry brush in
a small glass of water to wash down any sugar crystals that form
along the sides of the pot. As soon as the sugar has dissolved,
increase heat to high and boil until it registers 238 degrees (soft
ball stage) on a mercury candy thermometer (about 5 minutes). Quickly
pour the syrup into the center of the whipped yolks and whisk
vigorously by hand to combine, using the mixer's whisk attachment.
Reattach the bowl and its whisk to the mixer and whip on medium speed
(#5) until the egg yolk mixture thickens, increases in volume,
lightens in color and texture and cools to room temperature (about 4
minutes). Whisk into the cream cheese mixture until blended smoothly.
Whip the heavy cream in a deep 1 1/2 quart mixing bowl until soft
peaks form. Then fold into cream cheese buttercream. The consistency
is soft and thin, but after refrigeration, the cream cheese and fat
become firm to give the filling body and texture.
