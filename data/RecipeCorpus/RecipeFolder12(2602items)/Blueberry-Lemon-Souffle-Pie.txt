Title: Blueberry Lemon Souffle Pie
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Blueberries, picked over
1 tb Minute tapioca
6 tb Granulated sugar
3 lg Eggs, separated
7 tb Superfine sugar
1/4 c  Plus 3 tablespoons fresh
Lemon juice (4 lemons)
Grated zest of 2 lemons
1/8 ts Salt
1    Baked Flaky Pie Shell
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a nonreactive saucepan, toss the
blueberries with the tapioca and granulated sugar. Let sit 5 to 10
minutes, stirring once or twice, to soften the tapioca. Cook over
moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture comes
to the boil. Remove from the heat. Pour into a stainless steel
strainer set over a bowl. Reserve the drained juices.

Using an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with 4 tablespoons of the
superfine sugar until pale and thick, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat
in the lemon juice and then the zest. Transfer the mixture to a
nonreactive saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with
a rubber spatula, until it thickens, about 8 minutes; do not boil.
Scrape into a bowl and set aside on a rack to cool. Strain.

Using clean beaters, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the salt
and beat until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons
superfine sugar, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each
addition. Beat at high speed until the whites are glossy but not dry,
about 20 seconds longer. Using a rubber spatula, stir one-third of
the beaten whites into the yolk mixture. Gently fold in the remaining
whites. Spoon the blueberries into the baked Flaky Pie Shell and
drizzle 2 1/2 tablespoons of the drained juices over them. Mound the
souffle mixture over the berries; spread gently to cover the berries,
touching the pie crust all around. Bake in the middle of the oven for
about 15 minutes, until the top is nicely browned. Transfer the pie
to a rack to cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Yield: One 9-inch pie
