Title: Pork Chops With Kumquats
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Sugar
1/2 lb Kumquats, thinly sliced
2 tb Chopped shallots
1/2 c  Water
2 tb Tamarind glaze
1 ts Chopped garlic
1 c  Chicken stock
Two 8 ounce pork chops
1 tb Oil for cooking
Salt and pepper
In a small saute pan, melt the sugar and add the kumquats, shallots,
and 1/2 cup of water. It will form its own syrup. Allow to slowly
cook for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the tamarind glaze, garlic,
and 1/4 cup chicken stock, season with salt and pepper. Season and
grill the pork chops, occasionally basting with the tamarind glaze.
After the kumquats have cooked for 10 minutes, add the remaining
stock, bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Season, it may need
some more sugar, depending on how tart the kumquats are. Remove the
pork from the grill, place on plates and top with some of the kumquat
sauce. Drizzle with any remaining tamarind glaze.
