Title: Caldo Tlapeno
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 qt Chicken broth, preferably
Homemade
1 lg Chicken breast (about 1 1/4
Pounds)
1    Sprig each fresh thyme and
Fresh oregano
1 tb Lard or vegetable oil
1    Yellow onion, diced
1 lg Carrot, peeled and diced
2 lg Cloves garlic, finely
Chopped
2 oz Cooked ham, cut into 1/4inch
Dice
1    (15 ounce) can garbanzo
Beans (chickpeas), rinsed
And drained
1    Sprig epazote
1/2 ts Salt
5    Canned chipotle chiles,
Stemmed and thinly sliced
1 lg Ripe avocado, peeled, stoned
And diced
1 lg Lime, cut into 6 wedges
In a very large soup pot, combine the chicken stock and the chicken
breast and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Skim off the
foam that rises to the surface during the first minute or two after
it begins to simmer. Add the herbs, cover and simmer for 9 minutes.
Remove from the heat and let the chicken cool in the broth. Remove
the skin and bones from the breast, shred the meat and set it aside.
Strain the broth into a large bowl, skim the fat from the surface,
and clean the pot.

Place the dry soup pot over medium heat and add the lard. Saute the
onion and carrot, stirring occasionally, for about 7 minutes, or
until just beginning to turn golden. Add the garlic and cook for 1
minute more, until its aroma is released. Stir in the chicken broth,
ham, garbanzos, and epazote. Partially cover the pan and regulate the
heat so the soup is simmering, for 30 minutes. Add about 1/2 teaspoon
of salt, tasting to see if more or less is needed depending on the
saltiness of the broth. Remove the herb sprigs.

Add the chile and shredded chicken to the simmering broth and cook
until heated through, about 2 minutes. Ladle the soup into warm bowls
and garnish each bowl with diced avocado and a wedge of lime.
