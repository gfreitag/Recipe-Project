Title: Cutting Board Salsa
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
21 lg Garlic cloves
2    To 3 jalapeno chiles (or 2
To 3 bird chiles)
1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
(lightly packed)
3    4 tablespoons chopped fresh
Mint
1 lb Garden fresh tomatoes
1/4 ts Salt, or to taste
Juice of one lemon
You will need a large cutting board.

On a large cutting board, chop the garlic and then the chiles.  Add
the parsley and mint and continue to chop.  Slice and then chop the
tomatoes, adding them to the pile of other ingredients.  Mix as you
chop by turning the salsa with the flat of your knife or cleaver. Mix
in the salt. When all the ingredients are well-chopped, put the salsa
into a small attractive bowl and blend in the lemon juice. The salsa
will be quite runny, ideal for being sopped up with flatbreads.

Yield:  approximately 2 cups
