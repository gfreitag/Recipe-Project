Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Flank steak
Salt and pepper to season
2 lg Shallots
3 tb Balsamic vinegar
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Soy sauce
Accompaniment: Sauteed Portobello and cremini mushrooms (recipe
follows)

Pat steak dry and cut crosswise at a 45 degree angle into 2 equal
pieces. Season steaks with salt and pepper and transfer to a large
resealable heavy-duty plastic bag. Chop shallots and in a bowl stir
together with vinegar, sugar, and soy sauce. Pour marinade into bag.
Marinate steaks, covered and chilled, turning bag over at least once,
at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.

Prepare grill. Remove steaks from bag and discard marinade. Grill
steaks on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6-inches over glowing coals 7
to 9 minutes on each side for medium-rare. (Alternatively, grill
steaks in 2 batches in a hot lightly oiled well-seasoned ridged grill
pan over moderately high heat.) Transfer steaks as cooked to a
cutting board and let stand 10 minutes.

Cut steak at a 45 degree angle across grain into thin slices. Serve
steak with sauteed mushrooms.
