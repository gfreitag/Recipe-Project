2 c  Plus 2 tablespoons whole
Milk
3/4 c  Sugar
4 oz Milk chocolate, chopped
3    Egg yolks
2 tb Cornstarch
1/2 ts Vanilla extract

In a nonreactive saucepan, combine 2 cups milk and sugar. Bring the

in the chocolate pieces and whisk until the chocolate is completely
melted. In a small bowl, whisk the yolks together.

Temper the yolks into the chocolate mixture. In another small bowl,
whisk the remaining milk and cornstarch together for a slurry. Slowly
add the slurry into hot chocolate mixture and mix thoroughly. Bring
the liquid up to a boil and cook, stirring constantly until the
mixture is thick. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla and
butter.

Pour the pudding into a glass bowl. Place a piece of plastic wrap
directly on top of the pudding to prevent a film from building. Place
the pudding in the refrigerator and cool the pudding completely.
Whisk the pudding until light and fluffy. Pour the pudding into 4
wine glasses and place in the refrigerator. Top each pudding with the
whipped cream and garnish with chocolate shavings.
