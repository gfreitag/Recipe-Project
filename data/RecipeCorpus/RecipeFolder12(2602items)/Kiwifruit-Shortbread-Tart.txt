Title: Kiwifruit Shortbread Tart
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Sugar
1 c  All purpose flour
1    Stick cold unsalted butter
For lime cream:
1 c  Sour cream
1/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Fresh lime juice
3    To 4 firm ripe kiwifruits
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Make crusts:

In a food processor pulse together sugar and flour. Cut butter into
small pieces and add to flour mixture, pulsing until mixture forms a
crumbly dough, about 15 seconds. Divide dough in half and roll out
each half between 2 sheets of waxed paper into an 8-inch round (about
1/4-inch thick). Remove top sheets of waxed paper and trim rounds to
make perfect circles. Invert rounds onto an ungreased baking sheet
and carefully remove remaining sheets of waxed paper. Bake rounds in
middle of oven until pale golden, about 8 minutes. Cool shortbread on
sheet on a rack 5 minutes and transfer to rack to cool completely.

Make lime cream:

In a bowl, stir together sour cream, sugar, and lime juice.

Peel kiwifruits and cut crosswise into 1/8-inch thick slices. Spread
cream onto shortbread and decoratively top with fruit slices.
