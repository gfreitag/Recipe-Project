4    Five ounce pieces of red
Snapper fillet, skin on, but
With all pin bones removed
2 tb Olive oil
Salt and ground black pepper
To taste
1    Garlic cloves, crushed
1/4 c  Sundried tomatoes, soaked in
Hot water, drained, and
Julienne
2 tb Chopped fresh thyme leaves
2 tb Chopped fresh oregano
Leaves
3 tb Finely chopped shallots
4 ts Basil flavored olive oil
Season the snapper fillets with salt and pepper. Preheat a saute pan
with the olive oil until the oil is hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the
snapper to the hot pan, flesh side down, and cook over medium heat 4
to 5 minutes. Turn to cook the skin side an additional 3 to 4
minutes. The fillets will curl inwards briefly, but once they have
cooked for a minute, they will begin to relax and lay flat again,
allowing you to cook the skin side to a crispy texture.

Lift out the snapper with a slotted spatula, leaving the juices and
oil in the pan. Add the sundried tomatoes, garlic, and shallots, and
saute together for 2 minutes. Add the fresh herbs to the pan. Stir
quickly, just to heat the herbs enough to release their aromas. Pour
the sundried tomato and herb mixture over the snapper. Then drizzle a
teaspoon of basil oil over each fillet and around the dish.
