Note: To pickle chipotle peppers, combine 6 peppers that have been
stemmed and, if desired, seeded with 2 cups of red wine vinegar in a
small nonreactive saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat so
the vinegar is simmering. Cook, covered, for 5 minutes. Set aside to
cool, then store in a glass jar in the refrigerator for up to 3
months.
