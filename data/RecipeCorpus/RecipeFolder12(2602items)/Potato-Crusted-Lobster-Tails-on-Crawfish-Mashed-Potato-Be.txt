Title: Potato Crusted Lobster Tails on Crawfish Mashed Potato Be
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Cooked whole lobster, about
1    Pound
4    Whole lobster tails, cooked
1/4 c  Dijon mustard
2 lg White potato, peeled,
Salt and pepper
3 tb Olive oil
2 tb Butter
1/2 lb Crawfish tails
3 c  Mashed potatoes, warm
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 c  Red pepper coulis, warm
1 c  Yellow pepper coulis, warm
Couple of long chives
1 tb Chopped chives
1 tb Brunoise red peppers
1 tb Brunoise yellow peppers
Season each tail with salt and pepper.  Rub each tail lightly with the
Dijon mustard.  Using your Susie Wong Threader, thread each potato
half into curls.  Season the potatoes with salt and pepper. Wrap each
tail with the potato crust.  Place the tails in a damp linen cloth
and roll the tails up tightly.  This will secure the potato crust to
the tails. In a saut pan, heat the olive oil. When the oil is hot,
saut the tails for 2 to 3 minutes on each side or until golden
brown. Remove the tails form the oil. In a saut pan, melt the
butter. When the butter is melted, saut the crawfish tails for 2
minutes. Pour the sauted crawfish into the pan of mashed potatoes.
Over low heat, add the cream to the crawfish potatoes. Season with
salt and pepper.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Mound the potatoes in the center of the plate. Arrange the lobster
tails around the potatoes.  Spoon the coulis around the plate.
Garnish with the long chives, chopped chives and peppers.
