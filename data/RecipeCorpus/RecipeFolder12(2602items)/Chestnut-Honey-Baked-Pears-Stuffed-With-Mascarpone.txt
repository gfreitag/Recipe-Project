Title: Chestnut Honey-Baked Pears Stuffed With Mascarpone
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
4    Ripe but firm bosc pears,
Stem intact
1 c  Dry white wine
1/4    Cup, plus 1 tablespoon
Chestnut honey
1/2 c  Water
1    Cinnamon sticks
Zest of 1 lemon
1 1/2    Vanilla beans, split
1/2 c  Mascarpone cheese
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Combine wine, 1/4 cup chestnut honey, water, cinnamon, and lemon zest
in a medium saucepan.

Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean and add the seeds and the
scraped bean to the pot. Bring to a simmer, stirring. Pour the
poaching liquid into a baking dish just large enough to hold the
pears.

Keeping stems intact, remove the core from the pear using a melon
baller (apple corer) entering through the base and removing only the
woody core and seeds. Trim the skin off the base only of the pear and
place upright in baking dish. Bake the pears about 25 to 35 minutes
or until tender. You must baste the pears with the liquid every 5 to
7 minutes. The skins should be crinkly. Remove from oven and let cool
in the liquid.

Combine the mascarpone with the remaining 1 tablespoon chestnut honey.
Using a pastry bag, fill each pear at its base with the mascarpone.
Serve drizzled with poaching syrup.
