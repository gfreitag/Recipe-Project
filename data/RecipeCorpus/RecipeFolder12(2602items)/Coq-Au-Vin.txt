Cut into 8 serving pieces
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper

Garnish
Heat a large casserole or skillet over mediumhigh heat. Add bacon and
cook until light brown and enough bacon fat has rendered to brown the
chicken pieces. Season chicken with salt and pepper, add to skillet
and brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Stir in onion,
shallots and mushrooms, and saute, stirring occasionally, until
vegetables, chicken, and bacon are all well browned, about 5 minutes.
Add Cognac and ignite. When flames have died, add wine and cook over
high heat until the wine is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Stir in
beef stock, glace de viande and bouquet garni. Stir well and season
with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium low, cover and simmer
until chicken is tender, 15 to 20 minutes, skimming surface to remove
fat.

Transfer chicken to a serving dish or individual plates and pour the
sauce over the top. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with a rice pilaf
and warm French bread.
