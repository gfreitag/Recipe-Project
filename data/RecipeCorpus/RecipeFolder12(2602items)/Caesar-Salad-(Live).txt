Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
For croutons-
1/4 c  Olive oil
2    Garlic cloves, halved
3 c  3/4-inch cubes Italian or

For the dressing:
4    Anchovy fillets
2    Cloves garlic, peeled
1 tb Sherry vinegar
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1/2 tb Worcestershire sauce
2 ts Dijon mustard
1/2 c  Olive oil
Salt and pepper
3    Heads Romaine lettuce, pale

Make the croutons: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a small
saucepan heat the oil, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste over
moderately low heat. Remove the mixture from the heat, let it stand
for 10 minutes, and discard the garlic. In a bowl toss the bread
cubes with the butter mixture, spread them on a baking sheet, and
bake them in the middle of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until
they are golden. The croutons may be made 1 day in advance and kept
in an airtight container.

Make the dressing: Mince and mash the anchovies with the garlic to
form a paste and in a bowl whisk together the paste, vinegar, lemon
juice, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard. Add the oil in a stream,
whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified.

In a large bowl toss the romaine with the croutons and the dressing
until the salad is combined well and sprinkle the salad with grated
Parmesan.
