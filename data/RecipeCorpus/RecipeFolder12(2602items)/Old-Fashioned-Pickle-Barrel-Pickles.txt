Title: Old-Fashioned Pickle Barrel Pickles
Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
5 lb Pickling cucumbers of
Uniform size (4 inches)
4 tb Pickling spices
6 bn Dill, washed and chopped
4    Cloves garlic
1 c  White vinegar
2/3 c  Pickling salt
Gently scrub pickles with a vegetable brush and rinse with cool
water. Dry thoroughly. In a large stoneware crock or a deep enamel
kettle sprinkle in half of pickling spices, dill and garlic over the
bottom. Layer cucumbers in crock, filling within 3 inches of top.
Sprinkle with remaining pickling spices, dill and garlic. Mix vinegar
with salt and 2 quarts of water. Pour over cucumbers, to cover.
Weight with a plate and cans, making sure cucumbers are completely
submerged. Cover loosely with cheesecloth. Check pickles each day and
skim off scum as it forms -- it may not begin to form until fifth
day. Do not stir pickles, but make sure they remain completely
submerged in brine at all times. If necessary, add additional brine.
Leave for 3 to 4 weeks. Pickles will turn an olive-drab color and
texture will be soft-crisp and be uniformly translucent. Let stand an
additional month to develop flavor, replacing brine as necessary.
