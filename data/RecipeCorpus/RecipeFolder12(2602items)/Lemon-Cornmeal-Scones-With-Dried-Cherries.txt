Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  All purpose bleached flour
1 c  Stone ground yellow
Cornmeal
1/3 c  Sugar
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Salt
5 tb Unsalted butter
1 c  Dried sour cherries, about 5
Ounces
1    Egg
1/2 c  Milk
1 ts Finely grated lemon zest
2    Teapsoons vanilla extract
Cover a cookie sheet with parchment or foil. Preheat oven to 450
degrees and set a rack in middle level.

Combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Cut
butter into 12 pieces and rub evenly into dry ingredients, until
mixture has the appearance of fine cornmeal. Add cherries.

Whisk egg, milk, zest and vanilla together and stir into flour and
butter mixture with a fork, to form a smooth dough. Divide the dough
into 3 pieces and form into 5-inch disks. Using a sharp, floured
knife, divide each disk into four wedges. Place on pan leaving a
2-inch distance all around each scone. Bake scones at 450 degrees
about 10 to 15 minutes, being careful that they do not color too
deeply, or until they are firm, but not dry.

Yield: 12 scones
