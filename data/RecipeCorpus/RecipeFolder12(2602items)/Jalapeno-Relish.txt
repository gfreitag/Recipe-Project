Title: Jalapeno Relish
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1    Red bell pepper, seeded
1    Green bell pepper, seeded
6    Fresh red or green jalapeno
Chiles, seeded
6 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  White vinegar
6 oz Liquid pectin
In a blender or food processor, puree the bell peppers and jalapeno
chiles until smooth.

In a 6quart saucepan, combine the pureed peppers and chiles, sugar,
and vinegar. Bring to a hard rolling boil and boil 1 minute. Add the
pectin and return the mixture to a full rolling boil for 1 minute,
stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and skim any foam from the
top. Immediately pour into hot, sterilized jars to 1/8inch of the
tops. Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean cloth.

Seal the jars with the flat lids and screw tops. Invert the jars for 5
minutes, the turn upright. After the jars are cool, check the seals by
pressing the middle of the lid with your finger. If the lid springs
up when your finger releases the lid, it is not sealed. Or use the
USDA water bath method.

Yield: about 12 cups
