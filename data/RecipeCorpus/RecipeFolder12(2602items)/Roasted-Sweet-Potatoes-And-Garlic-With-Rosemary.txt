Title: Roasted Sweet Potatoes And Garlic With Rosemary
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Sweet potatoes (4 medium),
Peeled and cut into 1/2-inch
Thick
Sl
6    Garlic cloves
2 tb Olive oil
1 tb Unsalted butter
2 ts Minced fresh rosemary, or 1
ts Dried, crumbled
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Arrange the sweet potatoes and garlic in a shallow flameproof baking
dish large enough to hold them in a single layer. Add just enough
water to cover the vegetables. Bring the water to a boil over medium
high heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Drain in a colander.

In a baking dish, combine the oil and butter and melt the butter over
medium heat. Remove from the heat, add the potatoes and garlic,
rosemary, and salt and pepper to taste and toss to coat. Spread the
potatoes in a single layer and roast on the lowest rack of the oven,
turning them occasionally, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden
brown. Transfer to a heated serving bowl and serve at once.
