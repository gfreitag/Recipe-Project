Title: Blueberry Lattice Pie
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
Sweet dough for 2 crust pie
Filling:
2 pt Blueberries, rinsed, drained
And picked over
3/4 c  Sugar
3 tb Cornstarch
3 tb Water
1 ts Finely grated lemon zest
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Freshly ground nutmeg
2 tb Unsalted butter
Egg wash: 1 egg beaten well
With a pinch of salt
1 ts Sugar for finishing the top
The pie, optional
Filling: Combine 1 cup of the blueberries with the sugar in a
non-reactive saucepan. Bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring
occasionally, until the sugar is melted and the mixture is very

liquid--about 5 minutes. Combine the cornstarch and water in a small
bowl and whisk the blueberry and sugar mixture into it. Return
everything to the pan and cook, stirring constantly over low heat
until the mixture comes to a boil, thickens and becomes clear. If ii
does not become clear, continue to cook over low heat for a few more
minutes until it does. Pour into a large bowl and stir in the
remaining filling ingredients, except the blueberries, then add the
remaining 3 cups blueberries. Cool.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and set racks at upper and lower
thirds of the oven. Roll out the bottom crust and arrange in 9 inch
Pyrex pie pan. Pour the cooled filling into the bottom crust. Prepare
a lattice top crust. Flute the edge of the pie and carefully brush it
with egg wash. If you wish sprinkle the top of the pie with sugar.
Place the pie in the oven on the lower rack and reduce temperature to
375 degrees for about 40 minutes, until the crust is baked through
and a deep golden brown and the filling is gently bubbling. If the
top crust has not colored sufficiently after 30 minutes of baking,
move the pie to the upper rack of the oven for the last 10 minutes.
Cool the pie on a rack.
