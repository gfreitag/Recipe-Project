Render the sausage in a saucepan, over medium high heat, cooking
about 4 minutes. Add the milk, salt, cayenne, and butter and bring to
a boil. Stir in the grits and reduce the heat to medium. Stir for 30
seconds, then add the cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Cook,
uncovered, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the grits are tender and
creamy. Pour the grits into a greased square glass pan. Refrigerate
the grits until firm. Using a 2-inch round cutter, cut the grits into
six rounds. Season the flour and bread crumbs with Essence. Dredge
the cakes in the seasoned flour. Dip each cake in the egg wash,
letting the excess drip off. Dredge the cakes in the seasoned bread
crumbs, coating each cake completely. Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil
in a large skillet. When the oil is hot, pan-fry the cakes for 3
minutes on each side. In saute pan, heat the remaining olive oil.
When the oil is hot, add the onions. Season the onions with Essence.
Saute for 1 minute. Add the garlic and crawfish tails. Season with
Essence. Saute for 1 minute. Add the cream and bring up to a boil.
Reduce to a simmer and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the cream
has thickened. Season the sauce with hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce,
salt and pepper. Stir in the green onions and cheese. To serve, spoon
the Crawfish sauce over the Andouille Grit cakes.
