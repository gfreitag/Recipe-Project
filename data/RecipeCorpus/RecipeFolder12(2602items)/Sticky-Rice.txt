Title: Sticky Rice
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Sticky rice
Soak the rice in cold water to cover by 2inches for 3 hours up to
overnight.  Drain the rice and transfer to a bamboo sticky rice
steaming basket, or a colander or steaming basket which can be
suspended over boiling water.  Set aside.  Fill a wok or saucepan
with water. Place a rack or tray at least 1inch above the water,
cover the wok, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Uncover
the wok and place the ricefilled steaming basket on the rack over the
steam. Cover and reduce the heat to maintain a steady steam, and cook
until the rice is sticky enough to be squeezed into small lumps,
about 30 to 45 minutes.  Add boiling water to the pan as needed to
maintain the original level.  When the rice is done, turn it out onto
a large baking sheet.  Wet a wooden spoon and quickly and gently
spread the rice out into a shallow layer to help release some of the
steam. When the rice is cool enough to touch, gather it into a large
lump and place it into a basket or on a serving plate. Serve hot,
warm or room temperature.

Yield: 5 cups; about 4 servings
