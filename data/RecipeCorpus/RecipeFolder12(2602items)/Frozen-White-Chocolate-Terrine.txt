Categories: Emeril, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
4 c  Heavy cream, in all, very
Cold
1 c  Melted white chocolate
1 c  Melted dark chocolate
2 ts Vanilla
2 c  Raspberry coulis
Fresh mint sprigs
Powdered sugar in shaker
Dark chocolate cutouts

Funky pieces)
In 2 very cold electric mixing bowls, add 2 cups of cream to each.
Add 1 cup of melted white chocolate to one bowl and 1 cup dark
chocolate to the other.  Using an electric mixer, whip both bowls
until cream is firm, velvety but still spreadable about 3 to 4
minutes. Line a large loaf pan with parchment paper.  Spoon 1/2 of
the white chocolate mixture evenly on the bottom of the pan.  Spoon
1/2 of the dark chocolate mixture over the white chocolate layer,
spread evenly. Top the dark chocolate layer with the remaining white
chocolate mixture. Cover the pan completely with plastic wrap and
place in the freezer. Freeze until the terrine is well set, about 2
hours.  Remove the terrine and unmold.  Using a hot knife, slice the
terrine into 2 inch slices.  Place the remaining chocolate mixture in
a pastry bag with a star tip.  Spoon a small pool of the sauce in the
center of the plate.  Lay one piece of the terrine in the center of
the sauce. Pipe a small portion of the chocolate mixture off to the
side of the terrine.  Garnish with the mint, powdered sugar, and
chocolate cutouts.
