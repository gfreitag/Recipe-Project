Make the Cornmeal Crepes and the Poblano Chile Cream.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In an ovenproof baking dish large enough to hold 4 crepes, side by
side without touching, place the first 4 crepes. Top each crepe with
1/4 cup of the cooked lobster. Top the lobster with 1/4 cup of the
grated cheese. Sprinkle the cheese with 1 teaspoon of the pine nuts
and 1 teaspoon of the cilantro. Repeat layering 4 crepes, 1/4 cup
lobster, 1/4 cup cheese, 1 teaspoon pine nuts, and 1 teaspoon
cilantro and finally top with the last 4 crepes. You should have 4
stacks.

Pour the Poblano Chile Cream over all the stacks.

Bake for about 15 minutes. Transfer each stack to a plate, and serve
immediately, garnished with lime.
