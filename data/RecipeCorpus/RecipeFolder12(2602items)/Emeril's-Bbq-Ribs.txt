Make glaze:  Combine plums, shallots, garlic, stock, ketchup,
molasses, honey, vinegar, soy sauce, mustard, 1 teaspoon of salt and
6 turns of pepper in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high
heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, 15
minutes. Transfer to a food processor and puree until smooth. (Makes
2 2/3 cups)

Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Place ribs in a large stockpot and cover
with 4 quarts cold water.  Add Creole seasoning, crab boil, bay
leaves and 2 teaspoons of salt.  Bring to a boil over high heat and
cook 10 minutes.

Place a rack in a large roasting pan.  Drain ribs and season them on
all sides with remaining salt and 12 turns of pepper.  Brush with
glaze to coat.  Place ribs on rack and bake, turning and basting
every 10 to 15 minutes, until dark brown, crusty and caramelized,
about 1 hour and 25 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, cut into
individual ribs. Serve 5 ribs per plate with Cilantro Potato Salad.
