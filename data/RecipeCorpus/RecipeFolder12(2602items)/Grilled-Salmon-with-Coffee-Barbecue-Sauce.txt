Title: Grilled Salmon with Coffee Barbecue Sauce
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1    To 2 pound salmon fillet,
Skin removed
2 tb Olive oil, plus olive oil to
Brush on grill
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper to taste
1 c  Coffee Barbecue Sauce
1/2 lb Scallions
4    Ears of corn, husk and silk
Removed, reserve husk
Prepare an outdoor barbecue grill with good charcoal briquettes or
wood chips stacked against one side of the grill and let them burn
until ash white. Brush the salmon lightly with the olive oil and
season with salt and pepper.

Place the fish on the grill and begin to cook over in-direct heat
(cooler part of the grill). Grill 2 to 3 minutes on each side until
the salmon begins to develop grill marks.

Brush the fish with the barbecue sauce and cover the area where the
fish was cooking with the reserved corn husks. Lay the fish on top
and cover the fish with the remaining husks.

Continue to barbecue the fish in this manner until it reaches the
desired doneness

While the fish is cooking lay the corn to the side on the grill and
cook quickly. Cook the scallions in a similar fashion.

When the salmon has barbecued under the corn husks, remove and serve.

Yield: 2 to 4 portions
