Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
2/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 ts Baking powder
3/4 ts Salt
1 c  Granulated sugar
6 tb (3/4 stick) unsalted butter,
Melted and cooled
1 c  Heavy cream
2    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
1 1/3 c  Boiling water
3/4 c  Gold brown sugar, packed
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Into a medium bowl, sift together the
flour, 1/3 cup of the cocoa powder, the baking powder, and salt; set
aside.

In a large bowl, using an electric hand mixer, beat together the
granulated sugar, butter, cream, eggs, and vanilla. Add the flour
mixture and beat on low speed until just combined. Spread the batter
evenly in an ungreased 8-inch square baking pan; set aside.

In another bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/3 cup cocoa powder,
the boiling water, and brown sugar; pour this mixture over the
batter. Bake about 35 minutes or until a cake tester or toothpick
inserted into the center comes out with crumbs adhering to it. Serve
warm, topped with vanilla or coffee ice cream, if desired.
