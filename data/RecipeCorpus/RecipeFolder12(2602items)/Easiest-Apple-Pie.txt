Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
One batch Flaky Pie Dough
Crumb Topping:
1/3 c  Light brown sugar
1 c  All-purpose bleached flour
6 tb Unsalted butter, melted
Filling:
2 1/2 lb Firm, tart apples, such as
Northern Spy, Granny Smith,
Pippin
Or Golden Delicious
2/3 c  Sugar, light brown sugar or
Combination of both
2 tb Flour
1 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Finely grated lemon zest
3 tb Cold unsalted butter
Prepare and chill the dough.

For the topping, combine sugar and flour in a mixing bowl; add butter
and stir in evenly. Set mixture aside for 5 minutes, then, using
fingertips, break the mixture into 1/4 to 1/2-inch crumbs. Set aside
while preparing filling.

To form the pie crust, remove dough form refrigerator and place on
flat work surface. Roll dough, still between sheets of plastic, to a
12-inch disk. Peel off top piece of plastic and invert dough to pie
pan. Gently press dough into pan and peel off top piece of plastic.
Trim excess dough to within 1/2-inch of the edge of the pan and turn
excess dough under at edge. Flute edge of pie. Chill crust while
preparing filling.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees and set a rack in the lowest level. For
filling, peel, halve and core apples. Cut apples into 1/2-inch dice.
Place diced apples in a bowl and add filling ingredients, except
butter, tossing well to combine. Place filling in dough-lined pan,
mounding it slightly in center. Dot filling with butter and cover
with prepared crumb topping.

Bake the pie for 15 minutes on the bottom rack of the oven. Lower the
temperature to 350 degrees and move the pie to the middle rack. Bake
the pie about 20 to 30 minutes longer, until the crust is a deep
golden and the juices are just beginning to bubble up. Cool the pie
on a rack and serve warm or at room temperature.
