Place the chicken pieces in a baking dish. In a blender, combine the
citrus juices, rum, garlic, sugar, chipotles, red peppers, onion,
vinegar and olive oil. Pulse gently. Pour marinade over the chicken
pieces, cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. Turn the
chicken once. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes
before cooking.

Preheat the grill.

Place the mango pieces, banana slices and pineapple on a sheet of
foil and brush with lime juice. Set aside.

When the grill is ready, brush with vegetable oil. Season the chicken
with salt and pepper. Place the chicken pieces, cavity sides down, on
the grill and cook for 10 minutes. Turn and baste with the marinade
and continue cooking for another 10 minutes. Baste and turn chicken
every 5 minutes for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, or until chicken
is tender.

Lightly brush the fruits with melted butter. Set the foil on the grill
during the last 10 minutes of cooking time. Perforate the foil to
allow the heat to reach the fruit, then fold the foil into a packet
and cook until the fruit is slightly limp and lightly charred.

Place the chicken on a platter and arrange the fruit along the edges.
