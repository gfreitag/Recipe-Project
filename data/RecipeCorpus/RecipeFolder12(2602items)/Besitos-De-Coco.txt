Meat of one fresh medium coconut, grated 1 cup water

Combine the water and sugar in a heavy bottomed saucepan. Bring to a
boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until
it becomes like a hard ball or reaches 275 degrees. Add the coconut
and continue cooking until no steam rises from the pot and all the
