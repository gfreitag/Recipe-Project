Title: Roasted Garlic Mash Potatoes
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
3    Heads of garlic, split in
Half
3 tb Olive oil
2 lb Potatoes, peeled and diced
1    Stick butter, cubed
1/2    To 3/4 cup heavy cream
Salt and white pepper
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place the garlic on a pie pan and
drizzle with olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place in the
oven and roast for 35 to 40 minutes, or until tender and golden
brown. Remove from the oven and cool.  Squeeze or remove the garlic
cloves from the head and place in a small bowl.  Using a fork, mash
the garlic until smooth. Place the potatoes in a pot of salted water
and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the
potatoes until fork tender, about 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove the pan
from the heat and drain. Place the potatoes back in the pot and
return to the heat. Stir the potatoes, constantly, for 2-3 minutes to
dehydrated the potatoes. Remove the potatoes from the heat. Add the
garlic and butter.  Using a hand-held masher, mash the butter and
garlic into the potatoes.  Add enough cream until desired smoothness
is achieved.  The potatoes should still be sort of lumpy. Season the
potatoes with salt and pepper.  Yield:  6 to 8 servings
