the meat into 1/2 inch dice and reserve the liquid.

In another large sauce pan, combine the butter and flour over medium
heat, stirring constantly for 6 to 8 minutes to make a dark roux. Add
the onions, shallots, bell peppers and celery.  Stir occasionally and
cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the vegetables are slightly tender. Add
the bay leaves, thyme and garlic, cook for 2 minutes. Add the
tomatoes and the turtle meat. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes stirring
occasionally. Add the Worcestershire sauce, the remaining salt and
cayenne, the turtle stock ( about 6 cups) lemon juice, and sherry.
