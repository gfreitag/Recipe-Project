To prepare roasted beet
Pasta-
3    Jumbo eggs
1 c  Roasted beets in cubes (see
Recipe above), pulse in food
Processor
Until smooth
4 c  All-purpose unbleached
Flour
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, toss beets with oil and salt to coat. Place on
lined baking sheet and place in 400 degree oven for 1 hour. Remove and
allow to cool (about 20 minutes). Peel beets under running water and
cut into 1/4-inch dice.

To prepare roasted beet pasta:

Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, beet
puree and any other flavoring you choose. Using a fork, beat together
the eggs, oil and flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour
starting with the inner rim of the well. As you expand the well, keep
pushing the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this
initial phase looks messy. The dough will come together when 1/2 of
the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
hands primarily. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from
the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits. Lightly flour the
board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be
elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes,
remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in
plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Note:
do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are
essential for a light pasta. Roll out to four 7-inch by 16-inch
sheets.
