Title: Solid Chocolate Mousse
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
10 oz Extra bittersweet chocolate
12 oz Extra heavy cream
Melt chocolate hot, over double broiler (do not burn chocolate), heat
until it is warm to the touch.  Whip cream until very soft peaks form
(lines show in slightly whipped cream).  Very, very quickly add
chocolate to cream and fold in, mixture may look broken but keep
folding until everything is smooth, but do not overmix. Place in
bowl, cover and refrigerate until set. To serve, place the two
mousses in composition to contrast each other. Garnish with berries
and crisp a cookie, if desired
