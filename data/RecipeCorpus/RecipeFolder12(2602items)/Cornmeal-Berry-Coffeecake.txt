Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
Cake:
1/2 lb (2 sticks) unsalted butter,
Softened
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3    Eggs
2 ts Vanilla extract
3    Egg yolks
1/4 c  Milk or buttermilk
2 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
Flour
1 c  Stone ground yellow
Cornmeal
2 ts Baking powder
1 qt Blueberries, rinsed, picked
Over and dried
Crumb topping:
2 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
Flour
1/3 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Brown sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Nutmeg
12 tb (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted
Butter, melted
10 x  15-inch jelly roll pan,
Buttered
Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350
degrees. In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar until soft
and light. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each
addition. Beat in the vanilla. Stir yolks into milk. Sift together
the flour, cornmeal and baking powder and stir into the batter in
three additions, alternating with the yolks and milk, beginning and
ending with the flour. Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Scatter
the blueberries evenly over the batter, and press them in gently. To
make the crumbs, mix the flour, sugars, cinnamon and nutmeg in a
bowl. Melt the butter and stir it in. Rub the mixture to coarse
crumbs by hand. Scatter the crumbs over the berries as evenly as
possible. Bake the cake about 45 to 60 minutes until batter is firm
and crumbs are well colored. Cool the cake in the pan on a rack. Cut
the cooled cake into twenty four 3-inch squares. Remove the squares
from the pan to a platter.

Variations:

2 1/2 cups.  Stir 1 cup currants into batter.  Spread batter with 6
apples, peeled, cored, diced and cooked in 2 tablespoons butter and 4
tablespoons sugar until limp and cooled.  Top with crumbs and bake.
