Title: Sauteed Chicken Breast With Clover Honey And Chili
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Chicken breast, all skin and
Bones removed, sliced into
Thin strips
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper to taste
1 ts Dried cumin
2 tb Olive oil
3 tb Finely chopped shallots
1/2 c  Clover honey, slightly
Warmed
3 tb Sherry vinegar
3 tb Medium hot chili paste,
Ancho chilies
1 c  Chicken stock
1/4 c  Sour cream
4 tb Chopped cilantro leaves
1/2 c  Pecans, roughly chopped and
Toasted
Season the strips of chicken breast with salt, pepper and the ground
cumin. Heat a skillet with the olive oil until hot but not smoking.
Add the chicken to the pan, spreading the chicken out to evenly cook
the strips. Cook the chicken until golden brown, add the chopped
shallots and continue to cook, giving the pan a good stiff flip every
now and then. Add the honey and vinegar to the pan, removing chicken
to plate while sauce is completed. Be careful of the volatile
combination of hot honey and vinegar. Quickly stir in the chili paste
and the stock, bring to the boil and reduce the sauce quickly by 1/4.
Add the sour cream and heat until just below the boil, stir in the
cilantro leaves, plate and garnish with the toasted pecans.
