Title: Castagnaccio with Red Grapes
Categories:
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM--------------------MOLTO MARIO #MB5725-------------------------
2 c  Chestnut flour
2 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Walnut pieces
2 c  Milk
2 tb Virgin olive oil
2 tb Chopped fresh rosemary
Leaves
2 c  Red grapes, seedless
1 c  Sugar
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

In a large mixing bowl, place flour, sugar and walnuts. Add 1/2 cup
cold milk and slowly add rest of milk, stirring constantly to avoid
lumps to form in batter. Grease pan with 1 tablespoon oil and pour in
batter. Drizzle top with remaining oil and distribute rosemary evenly
over top. Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick pierced in the
center comes out clean.

While castagnaccio is cooking, place grapes and sugar in a small
saucepan over medium heat. Cook until quite soft and bubbly, about 10
minutes.

Remove castagnaccio and serve either warm or cool with grape sauce.
