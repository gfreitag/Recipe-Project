Make Chocolate Cake.  Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine chocolate and
butter in medium heat-proof bowl.  Place bowl over pan of simmering
water and allow chocolate to melt.  Stir until smooth. Meanwhile in
large mixer bowl, beat eggs, egg yolks and sugar on high speed until
thick and pale lemon color, about 5 minutes.  Add chocolate mixture,
beating on low speed until combined.  Fold in flour. Spoon about 1
tablespoon batter into each of six buttered, 3 1/2-inch jumbo muffin
cups. Place one truffle in each cup.  Fill 3/4ths full with batter.

to 14 minutes. Remove from oven. Let stand 15 minutes.  Carefully
loosen edges of each cake.  Carefully invert onto serving plate.
Garnish each serving with whipped cream and a dusting of cocoa.
