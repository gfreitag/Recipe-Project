6    Shallots (about 1/2 pound),

5    Leeks (about 1 pound), white

1/2    -inch thick pieces
3    Celery ribs, chopped

2 ts Chopped fresh thyme leaves
1    Stick unsalted butter
3/4 lb Vacuum-packed or canned
Whole chestnuts
3 1/2 c  Chicken broth
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Cut cornbread into 1/2-inch cubes and in 2 large shallow baking pans
bake in middle of oven until just dry, about 20 minutes.

In a large heavy skillet cook red onions, shallots, leeks, celery,
herbs with salt and pepper to taste in butter over moderate heat,
stirring, until onion mixture is golden brown, softened, about 25
minutes.

If using canned chestnuts, rinse and drain. In a saucepan simmer
vacuum-packed or canned chestnuts in 2 cups broth 15 minutes.

In a large bowl, toss together bread, onions, chestnut mixture,
remaining 1 1/2 cups broth and salt and pepper to taste and cool
completely. Stuffing may be made up to this point 1 day ahead and
chilled, covered. Bring stuffing to room temperature before
proceeding.

To cook all or part of stuffing outside poultry:

In a shallow baking dish bake stuffing in preheated 325 degree oven 45
minutes (for moist stuffing, bake covered entire time; for less moist
stuffing with a slightly crisp top, uncover halfway through baking
time).

Yield: 12 cups stuffing, enough for a 12 to 14 pound turkey with
about 7 cups left over or for two 5 to 7 pound chickens with about 6
cups left over.
