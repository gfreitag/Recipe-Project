Categories: Emeril, Chicken
Yield: 4 Servings
1    (3-4) pound deboned whole
Chicken
4 tb Olive oil
Essence
1 lb Chicken gizzards
3 c  Water
2 tb Flour
1 lb Ground pork
1 c  Chopped onions
1/2 c  Chopped bell peppers
1/2 c  Chopped celery
4 c  Cooked white rice
pn Cayenne
1/2 c  Chopped green onions
1/4 c  Chopped parsley

Preheat the oven 400 degrees. Rub the entire chicken with 2
tablespoons olive oil and season with Essence. In a saucepan, boil
the gizzards, covered with water for about 1 hour or until they are
tender. Drain the gizzards and reserve the liquid. In a food
processor, finely chop the gizzards. In a large saucepan, combine 2
tablespoons of the oil and the flour over the heat. Cook the mixture
for 8-10 minutes, for a dark roux, stirring constantly. Add the pork
to the roux and cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the
onions, bell peppers, and celery and cook for about 5-6 minutes, or
until the vegetables are wilted. Add the chopped gizzards. Pour the
remaining liquid into a 1 cup measuring cup. Make up the difference
with water. Add the liquid to the pot. Mix in the cooked rice,
stirring to coat evenly and break up any lumps. Add the green onions
and parsley. Season with salt and cayenne. Allow the mixture to cool.
Stuff the whole chicken with the rice. Place the chicken on a
roasting pan and roast for about 45 minutes or until the juices run
clear.
