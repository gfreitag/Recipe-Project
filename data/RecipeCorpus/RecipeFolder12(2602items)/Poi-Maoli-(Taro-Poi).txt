Title: Poi Maoli (Taro Poi)
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 lb Cooked taro
2 1/2 c  Water
Peel the cooled taro and cut into 1-inch cubes. Grind the taro in a
meat grinder, place the ground taro in a calabash (wooden bowl) and
use a poi pounder to mash the taro. Wet your other hand, slip it
under the taro and turn the pounded taro over so that it will not
stickto the calabash. Continue to mash and turn the pounded taro over
each time. Wet the poi pounder from time to time so it does not stick
and keep working at it until it is smooth and thick. Poi which has
not been mixed with water may be kept at room temperature for several
days by keeping it in the calabash and covering it with a damp cloth.
If the poi is kept in a refrigerator it should be mixed with water
before storing.

To mix: Add a little water and stir round and round with the hand
until all the water is absorbed. Keep adding water a little at a time
until poi is the consistency as thick or as thin as you like to eat
it. Store in a cool place or serve immediately. Or let it stand 2 to
3 days for a sour flavor.
