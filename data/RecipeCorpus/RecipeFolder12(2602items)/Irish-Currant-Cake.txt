Title: Irish Currant Cake
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
16 tb (2 sticks) unsalted butter,
Softened
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
2 lg Eggs, at room temperature
One 10-ounce box (about 1
3/4 c  ) currants
4 1/2 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
Flour (spoon flour into cup
And 1/2 cup
Measures and level off with
Spatula or the back of a
Knife)
2 ts Baking powder
2 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 c  Buttermilk or milk
Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
Prepare pans and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter until soft and light with a
hand mixer set at medium speed or in a heavy duty mixer fitted with
the paddle. Gradually beat in the sugar and salt and continue beating
about 5 minutes, until very light. Beat in the eggs, one at a time,
continuing to beat until the mixture is smooth and fluffy.

Place the currants in a small bowl and toss them with 2 tablespoons
of the flour. Stir the baking powder and baking soda into the
remaining flour in a bowl to mix. Stir half the flour into the butter
and egg mixture, then stir in the buttermilk. Stir in the remaining
flour, then stir vigorously or beat by machine on lowest speed about
1 minute, until well mixed. Stir in the floured currants well.

Scrape the batter into two 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 2 3/4-inch loaf pans
buttered and lined with parchment or buttered waxed paper and smooth
the top. Bake for about one hour and fifteen minutes, until well
risen and a deep golden color. A skewer or thin knife plunged into
the center of the cakes should emerge clean. Cool in pans on a rack.
Unmold cooled cakes and peel away paper.

Yield: Two 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 2 3/4 inch loaves
