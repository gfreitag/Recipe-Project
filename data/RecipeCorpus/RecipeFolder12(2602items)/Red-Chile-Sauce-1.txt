Title: Red Chile Sauce 1
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
6 oz Large semi-hot dried red
Chiles, such as New Mexico
Or Anaheim
Hot water
2 ts Mexican oregano
3    Garlic cloves
2 c  (approximately) water,
Chicken stock, or pork
Stock
2 tb Lard or vegetable oil
1 1/2 tb Flour
1 ts Salt, or to taste
Heat a heavy skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Meanwhile,
remove stems and seeds from chiles while rinsing under cold running
water. Place them on a griddle and toast, 3 or 4 at a time, just
until the aroma is released, 30 to 60 seconds. Be careful not to burn
them. Place the chiles in a bowl and cover with hot water. Let soak
until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain chiles and discard liquid.
Place chiles, oregano, 2 garlic cloves, and 2 cups of water or stock
in the container of a food blender and process to a smooth puree. Add
more stock if it is too thick for the blender. With a wooden spoon or
pusher, work the puree through a sieve into a bowl, pushing and
scraping to get all the solids blended. You may want to pour in a
little more liquid to help strain the sauce through the sieve. In a
heavy medium saucepan, heat lard over medium-high heat until
rippling. Add remaining garlic clove and brown in the hot fat,
pressing down with the back of a wooden spoon to release the flavor.
Remove and discard garlic.

Add flour to the hot lard and cook, stirring constantly, until
golden. Add the strained chile puree to the pan and reduce the heat
to low. It will splatter as you pour it in and be careful. Cook over
low heat, stirring often, until raw taste is gone and flavor of chile
is mellowed, about 10 minutes. Can be stored tightly covered in
refrigerator for up to a week or indefinitely in freezer.
