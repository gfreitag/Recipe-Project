6    Whole, trimmed scallions,

Wedges of toasted country
Bread, for serving
In a heavy saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Add the tomatillos,
3/4 of the sliced onion, 6 of the chiles, and 6 of the garlic cloves.
Simmer the mixture covered for about 30 minutes, or until the
tomatillos are tender. Cool slightly and transfer to a blender or
food processor. Add the remaining onion, chiles, and garlic,
cilantro, and salt. Puree the mixture. Preheat the oven to its lowest
heat and heat a wellseasoned flat griddle pan or castiron skillet
over medium heat. Brush each slice of cheese with a little oil, then
grill the slices for about 20 seconds on each side. You will need a
heavy metal spatula to turn them, scraping all the golden crust from
the pan and flipping it over. You will have to grill the cheese in
batches, transferring the cooked cheeses to a platter in the oven
while you finish cooking, but do not let the cheese melt. Place 2
slices of cheese on each of 6 warmed appetizer plates, pour the hot
tomatillo sauce over the top and serve immediately, garnished with
sprigs of cilantro and charred scallions. Accompany with wedges of
toasted country bread.
