Title: Gravlax
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Kosher salt
1/2 c  Chopped fresh dill
2 tb Grated orange zest
Fresh ground black pepper
3 tb Vodka
1/4 c  Sugar
1    (4 pound) side of fresh
Salmon, pin bones removed
And rinsed under cold
Water
1 1/2    Dozen fresh bagels
1 lb Cream cheese
1/4 c  Minced red onions
In a mixing bowl, combine the salt, dill, zest, black pepper, vodka,
and sugar together.  Place the salmon, skin side down, on several
large sheets of plastic wrap.  Cover the entire salmon with the
curing mixture, packing the cure into the salmon.  Wrap the salmon
completely and tightly in the plastic wrap and place the salmon, skin
side down on a 1/2 sheet pan. Place something heavy like a skillet,
weights, or a brick (which needs to be wrapped in plastic wrap). This
will help infuse the salmon into the mixture. Refrigerate the salmon
for 24 hours. Remove the salmon from the refrigerator and wipe off
the salt mixture.  Rinse the salmon under cold water, removing all
the cure.  Using a sharp knife, slice the salmon diagonally paper
thin.  Serve the Gravlax with the bagels, cream cheese and red onions.
