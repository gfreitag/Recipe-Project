For the dough, beat the butter and sugar with the paddle on medium
speed until very soft and light. Beat in the vanilla and the yolk and
continue beating until smooth and shiny, about 3 more minutes. Stop
the mixer, sift the cake flour and add to the butter mixture. Pulse
the mixer on and off to incorporate the flour. Scrape the dough onto
a piece of plastic, wrap and chill it until firm.

For the almond filling, combine almond paste, sugar, yolk and zest
and beat by machine until smooth. Beat in butter, scrape bowl and
beaters and beat in egg. Continue beating until light. Stir in flour.

Roll the chilled cookie dough on a floured surface and use it to line
a 9 to 10-inch tart pan. Arrange the sliced berries evenly on the
crust, then top with the almond filling, spreading it evenly with a
metal spatula. Strew evenly with the sliced almonds.

Bake the tart at 350 degrees about 25 minutes, until dough is baked
through and filling is set. Cool in pan, unmold and dust with
confectioners' sugar. Decorate with a few whole berries.
