with Essense, salt and pepper. Remove the fish from the buttermilk,
removing any excess. Dredge each fish in the cornmeal, coating each
side completely. Lay the fish in the hot oil and fry until golden
brown, about 7 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on a
paper-lined plate. Season with Essense. In a mixing bowl, combine the
