Title: Cream Of Broccoli And Pea Soup
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Broccoli florets, stalks
Peeled; finely chopped
1    (8 ounces) onion, finely
Chopped
1 qt Water or chicken broth
1 c  Frozen petite peas, thawed
3 tb Flour
2 c  Half and half or evaporated
Low fat or skimmed milk
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
Snipped chives for garnish
Simmer the broccoli and half the onion in the water or stock for 15
minutes or until tender. Add the peas and simmer 5 minutes longer
just to cook through. (As you are simmering, be sure to keep the
level of the water constant so that it does not evaporate too much.)
When the vegetables are tender, puree the mixture through a food mill
or blender. (If you puree it with a food processor or a blender, pass
the puree through a sieve to remove any tough bits.)

In a clean saucepan heat the butter. Add the remaining onion and cook
for 5 minutes, over low heat or until very tender but not brown. Add
the flour and cook for a few seconds. Whisk in the strained puree,
bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring on occasion to
make sure the flour does not stick to the bottom of the saucepan.
Gradually add the half and half or evaporated milk and adjust it to
the texture you like. Bring the liquid to just to under a boil;
season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle out and garnish with
chives if you wish.
