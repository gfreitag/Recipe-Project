For the crust, combine dry ingredients in bowl of food processor and
pulse several times to mix. Add butter and pulse to a fine powder.
Add egg and pulse until dough forms a ball that rotates on blade.
Press dough into a disk, wrap and chill.

For filling, combine corn syrup and sugar in saucepan and stir to mix.
Place over low heat and bring to a boil, without stirring. Remove from
heat, add butter and allow to melt.

In a mixing bowl, whisk eggs to break up and whisk in salt and
Bourbon. Whisk in syrup and butter mixture, being careful not to over
mix. Allow to rest while rolling dough.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and set a rack in the lower third. On a
floured surface, roll the dough and line a 9-inch Pyrex pie pan,
fluting the rim of the crust. Arrange pecans in an even layer in pie
shell.

Carefully skim top of filling and pour over pecans. With the back of
fork, press pecans into filling so that all have been immersed in it.
Bake for about 45 minutes, until crust is baked through and filling
is firm in center. Cool on a rack. Store pie at a cool room
temperature or refrigerate. If refrigerated, bring to room
temperature before serving.
