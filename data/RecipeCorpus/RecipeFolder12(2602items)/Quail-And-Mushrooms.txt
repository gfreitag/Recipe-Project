Title: Quail And Mushrooms
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
6 oz Chopped bacon
1/4 c  Flour
1 1/2 c  Chopped onions
3 c  Assorted Exotic mushrooms,
Such as shiitakes, oysters
Or hedgehogs
1 tb Chopped garlic
1/2 c  Dry sherry
1 c  Peeled, seeded and chopped
Tomatoes
2 c  Chicken stock
8    Quail, breastbone removed
And split down the back (4
oz Each)
Salt
Cayenne
Black pepper
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Chopped parsley
In a large skillet, over medium heat, fry the bacon until crispy,
about 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon and
drain on a paper-lined plate. Set the bacon aside. Stir the fat into
the flour and make a medium brown roux, the color of peanut butter,
by stirring constantly for 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the onions and
saute for 3 minutes, or until the vegetables start to wilt. Add the
mushrooms and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt,
pepper, and cayenne. Add the garlic and sherry and cook for 2
minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and chicken stock and bring the liquid
to a boil. Season the quail with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Add the
quail to the mixture and simmer for 30 minutes, basting the quail
every 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and parsley. Serve the
quail with the Jerusalem Artichoke and Potato Au Gratin and garnish
with the reserved crispy bacon.
