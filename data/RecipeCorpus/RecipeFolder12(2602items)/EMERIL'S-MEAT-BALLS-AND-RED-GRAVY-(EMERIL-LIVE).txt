all of the meats together.  Season with salt and black pepper.  Add
the minced onions, 1 tablespoon garlic, parsley, and bread.  Mix
well. Season with salt and pepper.  Form the mixture into small
balls. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil.  When oil
is hot add the meatballs and brown for 4 to 6 minutes.  Remove from
the pan and drain on paper towels. In a large sauce pan, heat the
remaining oil, add the onions. Season with salt and pepper.  Cook 4
to 5 minutes or until the onions are soft and clear in color.  Add
the remaining garlic and tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Cook
for 30 minutes.  Whisk the tomato paste and water together.  Add to
the tomatoes.  Add the meatballs. Bring the liquid to a boil over
high heat.  Turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer for 4 hours,
stirring occasionally.

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until
tender, about 8 minutes.  Remove from heat and drain. Drizzle pasta
with olive oil. Season the pasta with salt and pepper.

Grate the cheese. To serve, mound pasta in a bowl, spoon sauce and
meatballs over the pasta and garnish with the grated cheese.
