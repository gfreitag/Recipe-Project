Title: Refried Black Beans
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Dried black beans, washed
And picked over
7 1/2 c  Water
3 tb Lard or vegetable oil or 1
1/2 tb Each unsalted
Butter and oil
1 lg Onion, diced
1 1/2 ts Salt
In a large pot, place the beans and water and bring to a boil. Cover,
reduce to a simmer and cook 1 hour, or until tender and creamy in the
centers. Crush the beans in their liquid with a potato masher or the
back of a wooden spoon. In a large saucepan, heat the lard or other
fat over medium heat. Saute the onions with the salt until golden,
about 20 minutes. Add the beans and liquid and continue cooking over
medium heat, stirring frequently, until the liquid evaporates and the
beans form a creamy mass that pulls away from the bottom and sides of
the pan, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.

Refried beans can be kept in the refrigerator 3 or 4 days and
reheated in a covered casserole in a 350 degree oven.
