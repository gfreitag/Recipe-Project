1/4 c  Minced carrot
2 tb Minced shallots

Plum tomatoes
Salt and pepper
1/2    Polenta recipe (same as
Above)
Preheat the oven 375 degrees.  In a saute pan, heat the olive oil.
When the pan is smoking hot, saute the celery, onions, carrots,
shallots and garlic. Saute the vegetables for 1-2 minutes or until
the vegetables are wilted. Add the ground meats and saute until the
meat is brown, about 4-5 minutes. Strain the fat off the meat. Turn
the meat into a saucepan. Deglaze the pan with the red wine. Add the
stock and milk. Season with salt and pepper. Bring up to a boil and
reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 1 hour and add the crushed red
tomatoes. Continue simmering for 45 minutes or until the mixture
resembles a thick, meaty stew.  Grease a 3 quart baking dish. Slice
the polenta into 1 inch slices.  Spoon a small amount of the ragu
over the bottom of the dish.  Arrange the polenta over the ragu. Top
the polenta with the ragu and sprinkle with the

cheese.  Repeat the procedure until all the polenta is used.  Spread
any remaining ragu on top and sprinkle with remaining cheese.  Bake
for 1 hour covered and the last 5 minutes uncovered.  Spoon the
mixture into a shallow bowl.  Garnish with cheese and green onions.
