MMMMM------------------MICHAEL'S PLACE #ML1A04-----------------------
5 lb Beef tenderloin, trimmed and
Defatted, but left whole
1/4 c  Olive oil plus 2
Tablespoons
3 tb Dry thyme
3 tb Dry rosemary
2 tb Finely chopped garlic
3 tb Butcher grind black pepper
2 tb Coarse salt
MMMMM-------------------------WINE SAUCE------------------------------
1 c  Red wine
2 tb Shallots
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 tb Fresh thyme
1 tb Butter
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place an empty, heavy bottomed
roasting pan into the oven for 10 minutes. While it is heating,
combine 1/4 cup of olive oil, thyme, rosemary, garlic, pepper and
salt in a bowl. Rub this dry rub seasoning paste evenly over the beef
tenderloin. After 10 minutes, remove the roasting pan from the oven,
drizzle the 2 tablespoons of olive oil into the pan, tilt to coat the
bottom of the pan, and then add the seasoned fillet. Place in the 425
degree oven for 10 minutes. Turn the fillet over and return to the
oven to sear the second side for an additional 10 minutes. Reduce the
oven temperature to 375 degrees and cook until it reaches desired
doneness using a meat thermometer (an internal temperature of 135
degrees for medium rare) approximately 15 to 18 minutes additional
cooking time.

Sauce: In a saucepan, combine wine, shallots, and salt and pepper.
Reduce by half. Whisk in thyme and butter just to heat through.

When the tenderloin has finished roasting, remove it from the oven and
allow to rest for 15 to 20 minutes. Slice the tenderloin into 1/2-inch
slices and arrange on a platter. Spoon some wine sauce over the top.
