Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
12 oz Small diced foie gras
2 c  Julienned yellow onions
2 tb Minced shallots
1 tb Minced garlic
4 lg Eggs
4 c  Heavy cream
6 c  Day old bread cubes
Salt and pepper
2 oz Slice of foie gras (seasoned
With salt and pepper)
8 oz Duck breast (seasoned with
Essence)
1/2 c  Duck reduction, hot
Long chives
2 tb Chopped chives

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Grease six 8-ounce ramekins. In a smoking hot saute pan, sear the
diced foie gras for 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the foie
gras and place on a paper-lined plate. Place the saute pan back on
the stove and saute the onions until they are caramelized, about 2 to
3 minutes. Stir in shallots and garlic. In a mixing bowl, whisk the
eggs and cream together. Fold in the foie gras, onions and bread
cubes. Mix thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. Pour 1/2 cup into
each ramekin. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until they are set.

In a hot saute pan, sear the foie gras for 1 minute and remove. Slice
the duck breast on the bias and fan into a circle in the center of
the plate. Invert the ramekin onto the duck breast. Top the pudding
with the piece of seared foie gras. Spoon the sauce around the duck.
Garnish with long chives, chopped chives and black pepper.
