Title: Sweet Corn Blintzes With Cottage Cheese Filling
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Half-and-half
2    Eggs
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
1 c  Fresh corn kernels (about 2
Ears), or frozen
Vegetable oil for brushing
Griddle
Filling:
1 1/2 c  Cottage cheese
6 tb Sugar
Place the flour, half-and-half, eggs, salt, pepper, and butter in a
blender and process until smooth. Add the corn and blend for a minute
longer, until the corn is pureed. Pour the batter into a bowl, cover,
and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to overnight.

Meanwhile, combine cottage cheese and sugar in a small bowl, cover and
refrigerate until ready to fill blintzes.

Preheat oven to 350F. Heat a griddle and brush it lightly with oil.
Pour a scant 1/4 cup of batter onto griddle for each blintz. When
bubbles form on top, flip the blintzes and cook until lightly
browned. Remove blintzes from griddle and immediately place 1 to 2
tablespoons filling in the center. Roll the blintz and place it
seam-side down on a baking sheet. When all the blintzes are filled,
place them in the oven to warm, about 10-15 minutes. (Alternatively,
you can refrigerate unfilled blintzes, stacking them between sheets
of waxed paper and wrapping in plastic, and proceed with recipe when
ready to fill.) Serve warm with sauteed apples or pears.

Yield: 10-12 blintzes
