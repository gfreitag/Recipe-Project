Pull gently on the tentacles to separate them from the hood; most of
the intestines will pull out as well. Cut off the tentacles below the
eyes and reserve. Pull out long plastic like "quill" and discard it
and the intestines. Rinse out the hoods and, if desired, pull off the
purple skin with your fingers or a paper towel. Slice body into
1/4-inch rings. Set rings aside with the tentacles until needed.
