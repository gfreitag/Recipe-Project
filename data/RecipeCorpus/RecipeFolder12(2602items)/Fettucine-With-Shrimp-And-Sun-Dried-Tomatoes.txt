Title: Fettucine With Shrimp And Sun-Dried Tomatoes
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
6    To 8 quarts water
1 tb Salt
1 lb Dried fettucine
3 tb Pine nuts
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
16    To 20 medium, fresh shrimp,
Peeled and de-veined
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper to taste
1/2 c  Sun-dried tomatoes, soaked
In 1 cup hot water for 30
Minutes, then
Drained and julienned
1 tb Chopped garlic
1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
1/4 c  Fresh basil leaves
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Bring the water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add 1 tablespoon
salt and re-boil. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until
"al dente".

Place the pine nuts on a cookie sheet and put in the oven for about 3
minutes, until slightly browned. Set aside.

Meanwhile, stack the basil leaves and slice into julienne strips. Use
a very sharp knife to avoid bruising the basil, causing it to turn
black. Set aside.

Heat the oil in a large saute pan. Season the shrimp with salt and
pepper and add the shrimp to the hot pan. Cook for 1 minute before
turning and cooking on the other side. Add the tomatoes to the shrimp
and cook for 2 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat and add the
basil, garlic, red pepper, and half the pine nuts. Adjust seasoning.

When pasta is "al dente", drain and toss it in the saute pan with the
shrimp/tomato/herb mixture. Divide among 4 plates and garnish each
serving with the remaining pine nuts.
