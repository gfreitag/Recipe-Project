Title: Mustard Glazed Beef Short Ribs
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
4 lb Beef short ribs
Salt and pepper
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Whole butter
1 lg Onion, chopped
2    Carrots, chopped
1    Celery stalk, chopped
2    Jalapeno peppers, seeded and
Chopped
2    Cloves garlic, crushed
2 tb Tomato paste
1 tb Ground cumin
12 oz Dark beer
3 c  Beef stock
2 tb Each of rosemary, thyme and
Oregano tied in a bouquet
Garni
Cheese cloth
1/2 c  Pommery mustard
2 tb Honey
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Season the short ribs with salt and pepper and brown well in the oil
and butter combined in a large saute pan.  Remove the ribs and place
into a casserole or roasting pan.  Add the onion, carrot and celery
to the saute pan and begin to caramelize the vegetables.  Continue to
cook the vegetable mixture before adding the jalapeno, garlic,
tomato, cumin, beer and stock in quick succession.  Bring this
mixture to a rapid boil before pouring over the ribs in the
casserole. The liquid should not rise more than 2/3 up the side of
the ribs and the ribs should not be entirely submerged. Place the
casserole into the oven, add the bouquet and braise the ribs until
fork tender, about 1 1/2 hours.  Remove the casserole from the oven,
allow to rest for several minutes before placing the ribs on a sheet
pan. Degrease the braising liquid, strain the vegetables out and
discard and reserve the remaining juices for serving.  Combine the
mustard and honey in a bowl and liberally brush over the ribs. Place
the ribs back into the oven and roast another 10 minutes until the
glaze is caramelized dark and delicious.

Serve with the cooking/braising liquid in a sauce boat.
