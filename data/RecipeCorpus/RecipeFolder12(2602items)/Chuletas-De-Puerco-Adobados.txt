Title: Chuletas De Puerco Adobados
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
4    Ancho chiles, lightly
Toasted, stemmed, and seeded
1 tb Cumin seeds
2 ts Dried oregano, crumbled
2 ts Dried thyme, crumbled
I tablespoon salt
4    Cloves garlic
1/4 c  Mild white vinegar
6    Thick shoulder pork chops
1 small piece porkfat or up
To 1 tablespoon lard
Apple Tamarind Sauce (recipe
Follows)
1 cup sour cream
Jicama Pancakes (recipe
Follows)
Place the toasted anchos in a bowl and cover them with warm water.
Soak for about 20 minutes, then transfer with a slotted spoon to a
blender. Add the cumin seeds, oregano, thyme, salt, garlic, and
vinegar. Blend to a fairly smooth paste, but do not overblend.

Pound the pork chops with a wooden mallet until flat. Spread a layer
of the chili paste on both sides of the chops, place them in a large
shallow baking dish and refrigerate overnight or for 24 hours,
covered.

In a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, heat the pork fat until it
renders, or heat a teaspoon of the lard over medium-low heat. Cook the
chops very slowly, for about 20 minutes, turning over once. Add more
fat during the cooking time if the pan gets very dry and the chile
paste is in danger of scorching. When the chops are done through
(press them to see if the flesh springs back), raise the heat to
medium-high and quickly brown them on both sides.

Serve the chops immediately, garnished with Apple-Tamarind Sauce, sour
cream, and pancakes.
