Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the Parmesan cheese, bread
crumbs and butter until thoroughly incorporated, and press the
mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.  In a saute pan,
heat the olive oil. Add the onions and peppers.  Saute for 2 to 3
minutes then remove from heat.  In an electric mixer, beat the cream
cheese and eggs together until thick and frothy, about 5 minutes.
Beat in the cream, cheddar cheese, sauteed vegetables and crawfish.
Mix until thoroughly incorporated and creamy, about 2 minutes.  Pour
the filling over the crust in the springform pan and bake until
firm--about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and allow to cool to room
temperature.

For the sauce:  In a sauce pot, combine all the ingredients together.
Bring the mixture up to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and simmer for
about 5 to 6 minutes.  With a hand -held blender, puree the mixture
until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.  Spoon the sauce on the
bottom of the plate and dirty the rim.  Place a wedge of the
cheesecake in the center of the sauce. Garnish with the fried
crawfish tails, white cheddar cheese, parsley and red onions.
