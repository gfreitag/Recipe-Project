Peel the shrimp, leaving only their tails attached.  Reserved the
shells, sprinkle the shrimp with 1 tablespoon Creole Seasoning and 8
turns of the pepper.  Use you hands to coat the shrimp with the
seasonings. Refrigerate the shrimp while you make the sauce base and
biscuits. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large pot over high heat.
When the oil is hot, add the onions and garlic and saute for 1
minute. Add the reserved shrimp shells, the remaining Creole
Seasoning, the bay leaves, lemons, water, Worcestershire, wine, salt,
and the remaining 8 turns black pepper. Stir well and bring to a
boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.  Remove from the
heat, allow to cool for about 15 minutes, and strain into a small
saucepan. There should be about 1 1/2 cups.  Place over high heat,
bring to a boil, and cook until thick, syrupy, and dark brown, for
about 15 minutes. Makes about 4 to 5 tablespoons of barbecue sauce
base. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over
high heat. When the oil is hot, add the seasoned shrimp and saute
them, occasionally shaking the skillet, for 2 minutes.  Add the cream
and all of the barbecue base.  Stir and simmer for 3 minutes.  Remove
the shrimp to a warm platter with tongs and whisk the butter into the
sauce.  Remove from the heat. Makes about 2 cups. Mound the shrimp in
the center of a platter. Spoon the sauce over the shrimp and around
the plate.  Arrange the biscuits around the shrimp. Garnish with
chopped chives.
