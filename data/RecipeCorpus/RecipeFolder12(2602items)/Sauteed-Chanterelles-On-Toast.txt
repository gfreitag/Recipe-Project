Title: Sauteed Chanterelles On Toast
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Chanterelles
2    Shallots
1/2    Clove garlic
Parsley
1 tb Unsalted butter
Salt and pepper
1/4 c  Heavy cream or creme
Fraiche
4 sl Bread
Gently clean the mushrooms with a brush or a pairing knife to remove
dirt and small leaves. If the chanterelles are large, slice them;
otherwise leave them whole. Peel the shallots and garlic and chop
very fine. Chop about 1 tablespoon of parsley.

Heat the butter in a saute pan, add the cleaned chanterelles, season
with salt and pepper, and cook over high heat for 3 minutes. Add the
shallots and garlic and cook for another minute. Pour in the cream,
reduce the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes, until the mushrooms are
coated with a silky cream reduction.

Meanwhile, toast the slices of bread and put them on a platter. When
the mushrooms are ready

pour them over the toast. Sprinkle with the chopped parsley and serve
as an appetizer.
