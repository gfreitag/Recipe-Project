This dish gets its name from the city where it originated - Frogmore,
South Carolina. The original version of this Low Country seafood stew
calls only for shellfish stock, shrimp, and corn on the cob (no
frogs, thank you). My interpretation, a somewhat heartier concoction
made so with the additions of lentil, rice, peppers, kale, mustard
greens and duck sausage, is a Cafe Buelah favorite.

Combine all ingredients in a stock pot and bring to a boil. Reduce
heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Strain and set aside.

Stew: In a large saute pan over moderate heat, sweat garlic, shallots
and peppers in the oil. Add greens, herbs, and duck sausage. Cook on
medium flame for 5 minutes. Add shrimp and cook for about 1 1/2
minutes. Add tomatoes, stock base, and corn on the cob. Cook another
5 minutes, then add precooked lentils. Cook for 30 seconds. Remove
pan and set aside. Pour hot stock into 4 large soup bowls. Combine
rice and stew ingredients, dividing up quantities evenly into each
bowl.
