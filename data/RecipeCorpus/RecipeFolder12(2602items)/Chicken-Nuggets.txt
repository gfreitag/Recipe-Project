adults' portion whole. Marinate all of chicken in the mustard mix for
as long as possible. Season breadcrumbs with salt and pepper. Dip the
chicken in breadcrumbs so all sides are well coated. Heat the butter

or until just cooked through.

chicken cubes in ketchup, a barbecue sauce or some dressing they
love, then dip in breadcrumbs and proceed with recipe.
