Title: Grilled Hen
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1    (1 1/2 pound) Cornish hen
2 tb Honey
1/4 ts Ground allspice
Juice and zest of 2 oranges
2 tb Olive oil
Salt and pepper
Debone hens, beginning at top of bird along either side of breast
bone. Using a sharp knife, work your way down each side of carcass
trying to remove as much meat from bone as possible, to make 2
halves. Leave in leg and wing bones, but discard carcass (or save for
stock). In a shallow nonreactive container large enough to hold both
halves of hen combine honey, allspice, orange juice and zest, olive
oil, and salt and pepper. Add cornish hen halves, turning to coat;
meat should be completely covered with marinade. Refrigerate for 2
hours, turning once. Preheat grill for 30 minutes. When it is
medium-hot, place cornish hen halves on grill, skin side down, for 8
minutes. Watch carefully -- it can burn easily because of honey in
marinade. When first side is browned, turn and move halves to a
cooler section of grill. Finish cooking about 12 minutes more, or
until meat is no longer pink when you make a small slit down to the
bone. Serve with sweet potatoes (recipe follows).
