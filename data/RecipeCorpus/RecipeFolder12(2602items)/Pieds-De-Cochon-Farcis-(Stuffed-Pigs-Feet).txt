Title: Pieds De Cochon Farcis (Stuffed Pigs Feet)
Categories: Saveur
Yield: 4 -8
1/3 c  Red wine vinegar
3    Sprigs fresh thyme
3    Bay leaves
1 ts Black peppercorns
4    Pig's feet, split in half
Lengthwise
2 c  Finely chopped white bread
2/3 lb Boiled ham, finely chopped
2 lg Shallots, peeled and minced
1/2 c  Finely chopped fresh
Parsley
1/4 c  Milk
1    Egg yolk, slightly beaten
1/2 c  Dry white wine
Salt
1 lb Caul fat, rinsed
1.  Combine vinegar, thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns in a pot large
enough to accommodate 4 whole pigs' feet.  Reassemble pigs' feet,
wrapping each foot in cheesecloth, then tying with kitchen string.
Add enough water just to cover, weight with a heavy plate, then cover
and slowly simmer over medium-low heat for four hours.  Cool, then
refrigerate over night in cooking liquid.

2.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine bread, ham, shallots,
parsley, milk, egg, and 1\4 cup wine in medium bowl.  Mix well and
season with salt. Unwrap and separate pigs' feet.  Using your
fingers, remove leg bone down to ankle joint and discard (foot bones
should remain in place). Divide stuffing between feet, spooning about
1\4 cup into each cavity. Rinse caul fat, and cut into four pieces,
each about 12" by 12". reassemble pig's feet, wrap each in caul fat,
then fit snugly in a roasting pan. Add remaining 1\4 cup wine and
roast until golden, about 45 minutes. Separate halves again and serve
warm.
