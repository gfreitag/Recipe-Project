Title: Gingerbread Dough/Pepparkakor
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  (1 stick) butter, at room
Temperature
1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
1/4 c  Light molasses or dark corn
Syrup
1 tb Cinnamon
1 tb Ground ginger
1 1/2 ts Ground cloves
1 ts Baking soda
2 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Cream, milk or water
Melted white chocolate or Royal Icing, for decoration

In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter, brown sugar, molasses,
cinnamon, ginger, cloves and baking soda together until the mixture
is smooth. Blend in the flour and cream to make a stiff dough. Chill
at least 30 minutes or until firm. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 to 1/16-inch
thickness and cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters. (The
thinner you roll the dough, the crispier the cookies will be).

Place about 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Bake cookies for 8 to
10 minutes until lightly browned. Slide cookies and parchment off the
baking sheet onto the countertop to cool. Dip cooled cookies into
melted white chocolate to decorate, or decorate with Royal Icing.

Yield: about 4 dozen
