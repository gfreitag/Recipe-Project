Place on grill and char well. Cook about 12 minutes on first side,
flip, and cook about 9 minutes on second side. This is traditionally
served very rare.

Meanwhile, in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat virgin olive oil until
smoking. Add garlic and cook until light brown. Add spinach and stir
quickly, cooking until just wilted. Remove from heat, add lemon juice
and salt and pepper and set aside. When steak is done, remove and let
stand 5 minutes. Carve off fillet and strip steaks and slice. Divide
steak among 4 plates, divide spinach and drizzle each plate with Da
Vero oil. Serve immediately.
