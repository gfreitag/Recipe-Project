Title: Fresh Egg Pasta Dough
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
2 lg Eggs, beaten lightly
1 tb Olive oil
In a food processor combine the flour, salt, eggs, oil and 4
tablespoons water and process until the mixture begins to form a
ball, adding more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if the dough is too
dry. Process 30 seconds more to knead it.  Remove the dough from the
processor and let it rest, covered with an inverted bowl, at room
temperature for 1 hour.

Set the smooth rollers of a pasta machine at the highest number. (The
rollers will be wide apart.)  Divide the dough into 4 pieces, flatten
1 piece into a rectangle, and cover the remaining pieces with an
inverted bowl.  Dust the rectangle with flour and feed it through the
rollers. Fold the rectangle in half and feed it through the rollers 6
to 8 more times, folding in half each time and dusting with flour if
necessary to keep it from sticking.  Turn the dial down one notch and
feed the dough through the rollers without folding. Continue to feed
the dough through the rollers without folding, turning the dial lower
one notch each time, until the lowest notch is reached.  Roll the
remaining pieces of pasta dough in the same manner.

Use the blades of a pasta machine that will cut 1/4-inch wide strips.
Feed one end of a sheet of pasta dough through the blades, holding
the other end straight up from the machine.  Catch the strips from
underneath the machine before the sheet goes completely through the
rollers and put the cut strips lightly across floured jelly-roll pans
or let them hang over the top of straight-backed chairs or on
hangars. Let the pasta dry for 5 minutes, before cooking.
