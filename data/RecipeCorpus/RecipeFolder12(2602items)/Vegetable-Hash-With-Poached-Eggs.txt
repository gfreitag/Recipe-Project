Heat the oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the leek and
onion and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, salt and
pepper and saute another minute. Add the carrots, potatoes and scant
1/4 cup water to skillet. Cover and cook until vegetables are tender,
5 to 7 minutes.

To the vegetables in the skillet, add the red pepper, poblano chile
and mushrooms and saute until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the
cilantro and mix to combine, then turn the heat to high to lightly
brown the hash.

Meanwhile, poach the eggs: Bring 4 cups of water and the vinegar to a
simmer in a deep saute pan. One at a time, tip each bowl over the
water and let the eggs fall gently into the water. After 1 to 2
minutes, remove each egg with a slotted spoon and drain on paper
towels.

Divide the vegetable hash among individual plates, making a well in
the center of each. Using a slotted spoon, carefully place a poached
egg in the center of the hash. Serve warm with Salsa Roja.
