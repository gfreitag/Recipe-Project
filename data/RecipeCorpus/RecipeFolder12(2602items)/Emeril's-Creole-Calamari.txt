Categories: Seafood, Ethnic, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Roma tomatoes;
Cored and halved
1/2 c  +2 tb olive oil
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
2 c  Chicken stock
1 c  Sliced black olives
1 c  Sliced green olives
2 tb Minced shallots
2 ts Minced garlic
2 tb Small diced celery
2 tb Chopped parsley
1 lb Calamari; thawed
Cut into 1/4" slices
1/2 c  Buttermilk
Essence of Emeril
1 c  Masa flour
2 oz Grated parmesan cheese
In a mixing bowl, toss the tomatoes with tb of the olive oil. Season
with salt and pepper. Place the tomatoes on a smoker rack and smoke
for 15 minutes. Remove from the smoker and place the tomatoes and
juice in a medium saucepan. Add the chicken stock. Bring to a boil
and reduce to a simmer. Cook for 30 minutes.

Using a hand-held blender, puree the sauce until smooth. Strain and
season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.

In a mixing bowl, combine the olives, shallots, garlic, celery,
parsley, black pepper and the 1/2 cup of olive oil. Mix well.

In a mixing bowl, marinate the cut calamari in the buttermilk with 2
tablespoons of Essence and allow to sit for 20 minutes.

Combine the masa and flour together with the remaining Essence.

Dredge the marinated calamari in the flour mixture and sift to remove
any excess. Place the dredged calamari in the fryer basket and deep
fry until slightly golden in color, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir
constantly to prevent sticking. Remove from the fryer and drain on
paper towel. Season with essence.

To serve, spoon the sauce in the center of a large platter. Place the
calamari on top of the sauce. Mound the olive salad on top of the
calamari. Garnish with the cheese.
