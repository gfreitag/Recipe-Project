Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a saute pan, over medium heat,
add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the
onions. Season with salt and pepper. Saute for 1 minute, or until
slightly wilted. Add the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper.
Saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic, prosciutto and parsley.
Continue to saute for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and drizzle the
relish with the truffle oil. Set aside. Season the fillets with
Essence. Rub 1 teaspoon of the mustard over each fillet, covering
completely. Drain the potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Divide
the potatoes into 4 equal piles. Wrap each fillet with one pile of
the potatoes, tightly. Cover the potatoes with a damp cloth until
ready to use. Repeat the process until all of the potatoes are
crusted. In a large oven-proof saute pan, heat the remaining oil.
When the oil is hot, carefully lay the fillets in the hot oil.
Pan-fry for 3 to 4 minutes on the first side, or until the crust is
golden. Flip the fillets over and place the pan in the oven. Cook for
4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the oven. To serve, spoon the sauce in
the center of each plate. Place the crusted fillets in the center of
the sauce. Spoon the relish over the fillets. Serve immediately.
