Title: Smothered Chicken And Onions
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
Salt and cayenne
1 tb Flour
8 c  Julienne onions (about 2 1/2
Pounds)
1 c  Thinly sliced bell peppers
2    Bay leaves
1/4 c  Water
1 c  Whole kernel corn
1 c  Young sweet green peas
2 c  Sliced mushrooms
3 tb Finely chopped parsley
Season the chicken pieces with salt and cayenne. In a large cast-iron
skillet, heat the oil. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and brown,
cooking for 6 to 8 minutes on each side. Add the onions. Season with
salt and cayenne. Stirring constantly, wilt and brown the onions,
scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned particles, about
10 minutes. Add the bell peppers and bay leaf. Continue stirring,
again scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned particles,
for about 15 minutes. Add the water, cover, and reduce the heat to
medium. Stir occasionally and cook for about 30 minutes, or until the
chicken is tender. Add the corn, peas, and mushrooms, cover, and cook
for 15 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Add the parsley. Remove
the bay leaf and serve immediately.
