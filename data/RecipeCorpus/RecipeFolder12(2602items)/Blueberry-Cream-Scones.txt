Categories: Try it, Bread
Yield: 12 Scones
MMMMM--------------------COOKING LIVE #CL8949-------------------------
1/2 c  Heavy cream plus additional
For brushing the scones
1    Egg
1 ts Extract, vanilla
2 c  Flour
1/4 c  Sugar plus additional for
Sprinkling the scones
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Double acting baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
6 tb Butter; unsalted, cold, cut
Into bits
3/4 c  Blueberries, picked over
In a bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup of the cream, the egg, and the
vanilla. Into a bowl sift together the flour, 1/4 cup of sugar, salt,
baking powder, and baking soda. Add the butter and blend the mixture
until it resembles coarse meal. Gently stir in the blueberries and
add the cream mixture with a fork until the mixture forms a sticky
but manageable dough. Knead the dough gently on a lightly floured
surface for 30 seconds, pat it into a 3/4-inch-thick round, and cut
out 12 wedges or, using a 3-inch cutter, cut out rounds. Transfer the
wedges to a lightly greased baking sheet, brush them with the
additional cream, and sprinkle them with the additional sugar. Bake
the scones in the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 to 18
minutes, or until they are golden.
