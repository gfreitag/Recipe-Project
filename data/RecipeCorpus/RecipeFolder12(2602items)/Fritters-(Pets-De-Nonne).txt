1    Recipe Basic Pate a Choux
Oil for deep frying: 4
Inches of neutral flavored

Load dough into pastry bag fitted with medium star tip. Heat oil to
375 degrees. Sift together cinnamon and sugar. Holding pastry bag
above hot oil, gently squeeze bag and slice off 1-inch sections of
paste with paring knife. Pipe out only as many fritters as will fit

flip them over to cook the other side. Lift out of oil with slotted
spoon and drain on layers of paper towels. Sprinkle with cinnamon
sugar mixture while still warm.

The cinnamon sugar topping on these fritters is reminiscent of that
used on Latin American beignets such as churros.
