MMMMM-----------------TAMALES WORLD TOUR #WT1A04----------------------
1 3/4 lb Boned salmon fillet, with
Skin, or steaks about
3/4    Inch
Thick
Marinade:
3 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Sake, or dry sherry
1 tb Mirin
1 ts Fresh ginger juice
3 tb Oil
1 tb Mirin
1 tb Sugar
Sansho powder
Green bell peppers, cut into
Strips, for garnish
Lemon slices, for garnish
If using a salmon fillet, cut crosswise into 4 equal pieces. Mix
together marinade ingredients in a bowl or shallow dish, add the
salmon, cover, refrigerate and marinate for 20 minutes.

Heat the oil in a frying pan. Remove the salmon from the marinade,
shaking off excess liquid and reserving leftover marinade. Place skin
side down in hot oil. Move fish around constantly to keep from
sticking. When browned on one side, turn the salmon, reduce the heat
and cook, covered, for 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the salmon from the
pan, and drain on paper towels. Pour reserved marinade into pan, add
the mirin and sugar, and bring to a boil. Add salmon again. Cook
until marinade is almost cooked away. Remove salmon from pan,
sprinkle with powdered sansho. Slice diagonally and garnish with
green peppers sauteed in the pan, and lemon slices.
