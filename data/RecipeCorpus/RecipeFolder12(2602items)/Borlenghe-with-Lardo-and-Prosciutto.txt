Title: Borlenghe with Lardo and Prosciutto
Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Pasta flour
1 ts Salt
1    Egg, beaten
5 1/2 c  Water
1/4 lb Lardo (available at
Salumeria Biellese) plus 2
TB
1/4 lb Prosciutto, minced finely
2 tb Finely chopped rosemary
Leaves
2    Cloves fresh garlic, finely
Minced
1 tb Freshly ground black pepper
2 c  Freshly grated
Parmigiano-Reggiano
Combine the flour, salt and egg in a large mixing bowl. Add 2 cups
water and beat with a whisk for 5 minutes or until very smooth.
Quickly stir in remaining water. Allow to stand 1 hour. (The batter
will appear very thin, almost milk-like, but do not worry).

Stir together 1/4 cup lardo, prosciutto, rosemary, garlic and black
pepper in a mixing bowl until smooth and set aside.

To cook borlenghe, heat a 14 to 16-inch non-stick pan over medium
heat and brush with a 1/4 teaspoon of remaining lardo. Pour enough
batter to coat pan (just like a crespella) and return to heat. Cook 4
minutes on the first side and turn carefully. (The texture will not
be like a crespella, or anything else, for this is an original and
distinct delicacy. It may crack, but keep going). Continue until all
the batter is finished, or about 10 to
12    borlenghe.

To serve, reheat borlenghe quickly in same pan, spread with 1
tablespoon prosciutto mixture, sprinkle with grated cheese and serve
warm, folded into quarters.
