Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
Vegetable oil for frying
4    Dozen Ispich clams, shucked
Essence
1 c  Milk
1 c  Cornmeal
1 c  Flour
1    Egg
1 tb Minced garlic
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Chopped parsley
1 tb Capers
2 tb Chopped green onions
1 c  Olive oil
1/4 ts Cayenne
1 tb Creole or whole-grain
Mustard
1 ts Salt
4    Hot dog like rolls (about 6
To 8 inches long)
1 c  Shredded lettuce
2    Pieces of parchment paper,
Cut in half
Preheat the vegetable oil for frying in either a deep sauce pan or a
large skillet. Season the clams with Essence. Cover the clams with
the milk and refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove the clams from the
refrigerator and drain completely. In a shallow bowl, combine the
cornmeal and flour.

Season the flours with Essence. Dredge the clams in the seasoned
flour, coating each clam completely. Place the clams in a wire basket
and shake the clams, removing any excess flour. Fry the clams in the
hot oil until crispy and golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. For the
Tarter Sauce: put the egg, garlic, lemon juice, parsley, capers and
green onions in a food processor and puree for 15 seconds. With the
processor running, pour the oil through the feed tube in a steady
stream. Add the cayenne, mustard, and salt and pulse once or twice to
blend. Cover and let sit for 1 hour in the refrigerator before using.
Best if used within 24 hours. Remove the clams from the oil and drain
on a paper-lined plate. Season the clams with salt and pepper. To
assemble, spread the tarter sauce on both sides of each roll. Arrange
one dozen of the clams on one side of each roll. Top the clams with
the shredded lettuce. Roll the clam roll up in parchment paper and
slice in half. Serve the rolls with french fries, vinegar, and fresh
lemon juice.
