Reserve the pineapple boat.  Remove the core from the fruit of the
pineapple and cut into 1/2-inch slices.  Season the pineapple slices
with salt, pepper and remaining olive oil.  Place the pineapple
slices on the grill and cook for 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Remove

the rest of the fruit. Dice the cooled chicken. In a mixing bowl, add
the two reserved slices of fruit. Using the back of a fork, mash the
fruit against the side of the bowl.  Add the walnut oil and whisk
until emulsified.  Stir in the chervil. Season the vinaigrette with
salt and pepper.  In a mixing bowl. Toss the diced chicken,
pineapple, red onions, celery, and walnuts with the dressing. Cover
the salad and refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove both the pineapple boat
