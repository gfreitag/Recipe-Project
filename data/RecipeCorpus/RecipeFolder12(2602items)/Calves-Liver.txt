In a shallow bowl soak liver in milk to cover for at least 2 hours;

Dredge liver in seasoned flour, shaking off excess. Heat oil in a
saute pan, add liver and sear first side until well-browned, about 3
minutes. Turn and sear second side 30 seconds for medium-rare; cook a
little longer for medium. Remove to a plate and keep warm. To pan add
1 tablespoon of butter. Add shallots and pear; toss and cook 2
minutes. Add vinegar and cook for 1 minute. Add stock, bring to a
boil and begin to reduce. Return liver to pan, taste sauce for
seasoning and add remaining butter. Serve liver and sauce with
polenta, if desired.
