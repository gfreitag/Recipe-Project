Title: Almond Cookies
Categories: 2hot
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 c  Unsalted butter, softened
1 c  Sugar
1 lg Egg
1 tb Vanilla
1/2 ts Almond extract
2 c  Allpurpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped almonds
1/4 c  Whole unpeeled almonds
1/4 c  Cocoa powder
1/4 c  Confectioners sugar
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, cream the butter and
sugar together until fluffy. Beat in the egg, vanilla and almond
extract. Sift the flour over the top, add the salt and the almonds
and fold to combine thoroughly.

Pull off little pieces of the dough and roll them into balls about 1
inch in diameter, enclosing a whole almond in the center of each one.
Place on the ungreased baking sheet and cook on the center rack of
the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until light brown. Transfer to racks
to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, roll 1/2 of the cookies
in the cocoa powder, and the remaining 1/2 in the confectioners
sugar. Serve warm or return to the rack to dry.

Yield: About 28 cookies.
