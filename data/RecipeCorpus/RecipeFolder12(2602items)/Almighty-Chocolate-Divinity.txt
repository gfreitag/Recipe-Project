Title: Almighty Chocolate Divinity
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Walnuts
3 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Water
1/3 c  Light corn syrup
2 lg Egg whites
8 oz Chocolate mini morsels
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.

Toast the walnuts on a baking sheet in the preheated oven for 8 to 10
minutes. Cool to room temperature.

Process the walnuts in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a
metal blade until finely chopped, about 8 to 10 seconds.

Heat the granulated sugar, water and corn syrup in a 3-quart saucepan
over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Bring to a
boil. Continue toe boil, stirring often, until the temperature of the
syrup reaches 250 degrees Fahrenheit, about 5 minutes.

As soon as the syrup begins boiling, place the egg whites in the bowl
of an electric mixer fitted with a balloon whip. Whisk on high speed
until soft peaks form, about 4 minutes. Change the mixer speed to
medium. Carefully and slowly pour the 250 degree Fahrenheit syrup
into the whisked egg whites and continue to whisk on medium until the
meringue is very thick, about 4 minutes. Remove the bowl from the
mixer. Working quickly, use a rubber spatula to fold the walnuts and
then the chocolate morsels into the meringue creating a variegated
mixture. Divide the mixture into 24 large heaping tablespoons onto a
two large pieces of waxed paper, using a finger to push the mixture
off the spoon onto the wax paper. Allow to cool to room temperature
for about an hour before storing in a tightly sealed plastic
container.
