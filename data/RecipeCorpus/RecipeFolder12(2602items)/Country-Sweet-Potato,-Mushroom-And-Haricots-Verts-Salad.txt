Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
Oil for frying
1 lg Sweet potato, peeled and
Sliced paper-thin into
Chips
4 oz Raw bacon, diced
1/2 lb Assorted exotic mushrooms,
Cleaned and sliced
1 sm Red onion, julienne
1/2 lb Haricots verts, blanched
2 ts Chopped garlic
Salt and pepper
Preheat the fryer. Place the sweet potato chips in the hot oil and fry
until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally to
prevent the chips from sticking together. In a large heated saute
pan, add the bacon and render until crispy, about 6 minutes, stirring
occasionally to prevent burning. Add the mushrooms and saute for 2 to
3 minutes or until the mushrooms start to wilt. Add the onions, beans
and garlic and continue to saute for 2 minutes. Season the mixture
with salt and pepper. Remove the chips from the oil and drain on a
paper-lined plate. Season the chips with salt and pepper. In a mixing
bowl, toss the sweet potato chips with the mushroom mixture.
