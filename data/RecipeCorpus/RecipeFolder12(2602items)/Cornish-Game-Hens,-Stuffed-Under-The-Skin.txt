1/2 c  Low fat ricotta cheese
About 1/4 to 1/3 cup fresh

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a small mixing bowl, combine basil,
garlic, ricotta cheese and soft bread crumbs; bind the ingredients
together with egg yolk.

With heavy shears, cut each bird along one side of backbone and
remove as much fat as possible. Cut backbone away; insert your
fingers under the skin covering the breast and top of drumsticks.
Loosen skin as much as possible and insert some stuffing between
flesh and skin. Set bird halves, breast side up in a baking pan; rub
olive oil over the skin and season with salt and pepper.

Bake for about 10 minutes, lower heat to 375 degrees and bake for 35
to 40 minutes longer or until done; let bird rest 10 minute before
serving to let stuffing settle and firm up. Serve with bread and 1 or
2 vegetable purees.
