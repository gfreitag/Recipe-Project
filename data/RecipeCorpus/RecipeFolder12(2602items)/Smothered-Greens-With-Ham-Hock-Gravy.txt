Combine the oil and flour in a 8 quart pot over medium heat and stir
with a wooden spoon until smooth. Cook the mixture, stirring
constantly, to make a blond roux, about 8 minutes. Add the onions to
the roux. Season with salt and cayenne. Cook the onions for about 4
to 6 minutes, or until the onions are soft. Add the bay leaves and
garlic and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Add the stock and ham
hocks. Bring the liquid to a boil and reduce to a simmer, stirring
occasionally. Simmer the liquid for about 2 hours, or until the hocks
are very tender. Add the greens, by the handful, until all of them
are combined in the mixture. They will wilt. Add the water. Simmer
until the greens are very tender and the mixture is thick, about 45
minutes. Remove the bay leaves and serve warm.
