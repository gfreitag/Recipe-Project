Thin paillard or cutlet with
Bone still
Attached
1 c  Flour
3    Eggs
1/4 c  Milk
2 tb Pure olive oil plus 1/3 cup
For sauteing
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
1 1/2 c  Bread crumbs
1/4 c  Chopped Italian parsley
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1 lg Beefsteak tomato, about 3/4
To 1 pound, seeds removed
And cut into
1/2    -inch dice
8    To 10 basil leaves, hand
Shredded
3 tb Fresh lemon juice
1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil
Salt and fresh ground black
Pepper to taste
Pound the veal (or have the butcher do this ahead of time) to a
1/4-inch thin and broad cutlet, leaving the bone still attached. Set
aside while you prepare the breading setup.  Put the flour on a dish
large enough to dredge the veal on.  Combine the eggs, milk, 2
tablespoons olive oil and salt and pepper in a large bowl or dish
with sides high enough to hold the liquid and veal chops.  Next,
combine the bread crumbs, parsley and Parmesan cheese in a large flat
casserole so that the process of breading may be kept neat and tidy.
Make the tomato vinaigrette by combining the diced tomato with the
shredded basil leaves in a bowl. Stir in the lemon juice, whisk in
the oil and season with salt and pepper.  Set aside.  Heat the 1/3
cup olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.  Cook the veal
cutlets one at a time, or if they are small enough and your pan is
large enough, two at a time.  As you saute the veal, brown one side
and keep the veal warm in a 250 degree oven while the rest are
cooked. Serve the veal with a generous spoonful of the Tomato Basil
Vinaigrette over the top.
