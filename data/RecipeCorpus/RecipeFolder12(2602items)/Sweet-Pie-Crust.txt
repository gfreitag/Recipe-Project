Title: Sweet Pie Crust
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Solid vegetable shortening
1/2 c  Ice water
For the crust: In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt and sugar.
Add the shortening and work it through with your hands until the
mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a
time, and work it in with your hands until you have a smooth ball of
dough. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30
minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a
lightly floured surface. This recipe will make two pie crusts.

For the individual crust: Divide the dough into fourths. Roll out the
dough on the floured surface into a circle about 5 inches in diameter
and 1/8 thick.

For the whole pie crust: Roll out the dough on the floured surface
into a circle about 14 inches in diameter and 1/8 inch thick. Gently
fold the circles of dough in half and then in half again so that you
can lift it without tearing it, and unfold into a 9-inch pie pan.

Yields: 2 pie crusts
