Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb White wine vinegar
3 tb Dry white wine
1 tb Finely minced shallots
Salt and white pepper, to
Taste
2    Sticks unsalted butter,
Chilled and cut into 16
Pieces
In a 1 1/2 quart saucepan combine vinegar, wine, shallots, salt and
white pepper and bring to a simmer.

Gently simmer liquid until reduced to 1 1/2 tablespoons.  Remove from
heat and immediately swirl or whisk in 2 pieces of chilled butter. As
the butter is incorporated into the liquid add another piece and
continue to swirl or whisk.  Return pan to low heat and while
constantly swirling or whisking add successive pieces of butter. When
all of the butter has been added remove from heat. Sauce will be
thick and creamy. Adjust seasoning to taste.  Serve immediately. To
hold the sauce set the pan in a larger pan of lukewarm water.  If the
sauce separates, transfer a spoonful of the sauce to a cold mixing
bowl and gradually whisk the rest of the sauce in by the spoonful.
The sauce can be reheated by gradually whisking 2 to 3 tablespoons of
hot liquid, i.e. water, cream or stock.

Yield: 1 cup sauce
