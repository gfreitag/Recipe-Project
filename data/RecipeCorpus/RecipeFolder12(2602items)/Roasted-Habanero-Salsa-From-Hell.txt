Title: Roasted Habanero Salsa From Hell
Categories: Sauces, World, Mexican
Yield: 1 Servings
1 tb Virgin olive oil
1/3 c  Virgin olive oil
6    Ripe plum tomatoes, halved
Freshly ground black pepper
10    Habanero chile peppers
1/4 c  Lime juice (about 2 limes)
1/4 c  Chopped cilantro
Combine tablespoon of olive oil and garlic and mix well.  Rub
:
tomato halves with this mixture, sprinkle with salt and freshly
cracked pepper and roast in 500-degree oven until they begin to take
o some serious color, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from oven, cool
to room temperature and dice
Meanwhile, grill habanero peppers over a medium-hot fire until
:
slightly colored, 2 to 3 minutes.  Temove peppers from fire and
mince.  Be very careful when working with this pepper.  Wear gloves
when mincing it, and if you get any of the juice on your skin, wash
it off with a mild bleach solution, which neutralizes the capsaicin.
Also, be sure not to rub your eyes while working with these peppers,
and wash your hands well after you're done.  These little guys are
incendiary.
In medium-size bowl, combine tomatoes, peppers, 1/4 cup olive
:
oil, lime juice and cilantro, mix well, and prepare for takeoff.
This salsa will keep, covered and refrigerated, about 5 to 6
:
weeks, mainly because no mold or bacteria would dare to come near the
stuff. Yields 2 cups. Source: "Salsas, Sambals, Chutney and
