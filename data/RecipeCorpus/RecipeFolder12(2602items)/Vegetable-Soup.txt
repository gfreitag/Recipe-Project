Title: Vegetable Soup
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 md Onions, peeled
1    Celery stick, trimmed
2    Zucchini, trimmed unpeeled
2    Leeks, white and part of the
Green, trimmed, cut in half
2    Carrots, peeled
2    Bay leaves
Twig or 2 teaspoons of dry
Or fresh thyme, or sage
2    Garlic cloves, peeled
(optional)
5 c  Water
Salt
Pepper
Garnish:
1/2    Raw carrot, peeled,
Shredded
1 tb Fresh herbs (parsley, basil
Or chervil)
1 tb Olive oil
4    Bread rounds or 2 slices of
Wholewheat bread cut in
Triangles
2 tb Grated Swiss or hard cheddar
Cheese
Peel, trim, and remove the withered leaves of the leeks, wash the
vegetables, and chop them coarsely as you are going to puree them
later.

Bring the pan of salty water to a boil. Add the dry herbs, the garlic
cloves and the vegetables. Lower the flame and cook uncovered for 30
to 35 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place the bread sprinkled grated Swiss
and a drop of olive oil on top on a cookie sheet and bake for a few
minutes. Turn it off and leave until ready to use.

Puree the vegetables in the food processor or mill or blender. Pour
the soup in a warm serving tureen, check the seasoning and add salt
and pepper to taste. Shred a raw carrot with a peeler or a sharp
knife on top of the soup, add the minced parsley (or any fresh herb).
Drizzle a drop of olive oil. Float the crisp bread and cheese on top
and serve.

Only water is served with soup, no wine. But this is of course not a
sacred rule.
