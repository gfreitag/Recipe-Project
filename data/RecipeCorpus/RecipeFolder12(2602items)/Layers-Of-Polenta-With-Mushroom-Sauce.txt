Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Water
2 c  Milk
1/3 c  Butter
Salt and pepper to taste
1 1/3 c  White polenta
1/4 c  Dry white wine
2 c  Cream
6 c  Fontina cheese
2 c  Parmigiano Reggiano, grated
4 c  Mixed mushrooms (porcini,
Chanterelles, morels,
Champignon)
2    Cloves of garlic
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
1 c  Chicken stock
1/4 c  Flat parsley, chopped fine
Bring to a boil the water, milk, a pinch of salt and butter. When the
mixture reaches boil, pour in the polenta flour in a stream, mixing
continuously. Cook for approximately 45 minutes. (The polenta will be
cooked when it pulls off the sides). When the polenta is cooked, pour
it into 4 shallow, lightly buttered baking dishes into layers of
approximately 1/2-inch high. Shake to set, and let cool in
refrigerator covered with clear plastic wrap.

In a deep pan, heat the cream. Add the 4 cups of Fontina cheese and
stir until the cheese is melted. In a deep buttered baking dish, set
one layer of polenta. Then pour 1/3 of the Fontina cheese mixture,
sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano. Follow with another layer of
polenta, another layer of Fontina cheese and so on until finished.
Top off with remaining shavings of Fontina and Parmigiano-Reggiano.
Bake in a preheated oven at 425 degrees for 20 minutes.

While the polenta is baking, clean, wash and drain the mushrooms well.
Slice the garlic and cook until golden in 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
Add the cleaned mushrooms, stir until all water evaporates (approx. 10
minutes). Add the wine; allow it to evaporate and then add the chicken
stock. Let cook for 5 minutes, add parsley and cook an additional 2
to 3 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste. To serve, cut the polenta into
rectangles with a spatula and pour the mushroom sauce over it.
Sprinkle with parsley.
