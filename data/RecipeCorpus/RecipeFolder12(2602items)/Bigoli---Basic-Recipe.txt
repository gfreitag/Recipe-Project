Title: Bigoli - Basic Recipe
Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Whole wheat flour and bench
Flour
4    Eggs
1/2 c  Warm milk with 2 tablespoons
Butter melted in
To make pasta:

Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and
milk mixture. Using a fork, beat together the eggs and milk mixture
and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the
well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well
shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough
will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
hands. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board
and scrape up any leftover crusty bits.  Discard these bits. Lightly
flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough
should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another
3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the
dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Note:  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe.
They are essential for a light pasta.

To make bigoli:

Knead dough until smooth and tight and let rest 20 minutes.  Cut
dough into 6 and run through a meat grinder set to smallest extrusion
size. As pasta exits, cut it into 12-inch pieces and immediately dust
with flour. Lay out on to cookie sheet dusted with cornmeal, being
careful to keep the strands separate.  Finish all 6 pieces the same
way.
