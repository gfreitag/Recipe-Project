Title: Apple Tart Tatin
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1    Stick butter
1/3 c  Brown sugar
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
2    To 3 large tart apples
Pie dough
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Lightly grease a 9 or 10-inch cake pan
or use a 9 or 10-inch skillet or saute pan. Melt sugars and butter
together in microwave. Pour into prepared cake pan. If using a
skillet, melt butter, then add sugars until dissolved. Remove skillet
from heat. Peel and core apples. Section lengthwise into 12 segments.
Arrange apples over melted sugar in pan or skillet. Use as many
apples as will fit in the pan, packing tightly and making several
layers. The apples should come to the top. Roll a thick layer of pie
dough and cut to fit top of pan/skillet. Bake at 450 degrees until
sugar starts to bubble through the top (approximately 20 to 30
minutes). Reduce oven temperature to 400 and continue baking until
pie dough is brown. Turn out immediately onto serving platter, or
leave at room temperature until ready to serve. Then reheat on top of
stove until sugar starts to bubble and then turn out.
