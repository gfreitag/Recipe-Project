1/4 pt Walnut oil
Handful chopped parsley

In a food processor grind the walnuts and garlic. Add 1 tablespoon
cold water to help. Season with salt and pepper and slowly beat in
the oil until you have a thick sauce almost like a mayonnaise. Stir
in the parsley.

Marinate the chicken breasts in the yoghurt, seasoned with salt,
pepper and lemon juice for 1/2 hour. Wipe off surplus yoghurt.

Heat some oil in a frying pan and pan fry the chicken for about 3
minutes each side to sear. Spoon over the aillade and cook over low
heat until chicken is done.
