1 tb Chopped shallots
1 c  Demi glace

In a bowl soak the cranberries in the port for 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
heat the oil in a saute pan.  Season the venison chops with salt and
pepper on both sides.  Place chops into the saute pan and sear them
on both sides for 3 minutes.  Remove and set aside. Place the
shallots in the same pan and cook for 1 minute.  Drain the port from
the cranberries, and carefully add it to the pan.  It will ignite.
When the fire dies, add the demi glace as well as the venison, and
the cranberries. Cook for 2 minutes flipping the chops once. Swirl in
the butter and season. Serve with polenta, parsley, and cheese.
