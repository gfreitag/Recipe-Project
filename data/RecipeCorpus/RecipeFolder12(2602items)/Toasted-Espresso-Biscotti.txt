Title: Toasted Espresso Biscotti
Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/4 c  Almonds (6 ounces)
6 tb Espresso coffee beans
1 c  Sugar
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1    Stick chilled unsalted
Butter, cut in small pieces
3    Eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 c  Brewed espresso
Ground cinnamon or cocoa,
For dusting
4 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
Melted for dipping
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease cookie sheet.

Spread almonds and espresso beans on 2 separate baking sheets; bake 8
to 10 minutes or until lightly toasted. In a food processor fitted
with steel blade, coarsely chop half of espresso beans; transfer to a
small bowl. In food processor finely chop almonds and remaining
espresso beans with 1/2 cup of the sugar and add to bowl.

In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Use your
fingers to quickly cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse
crumbs. Stir in remaining sugar and coffee-almond mixture. Add eggs
and brewed espresso, stirring until dough comes together.

On lightly-floured surface, knead dough 2 minutes until smooth. Shape
into 2 flat 2-inch-wide logs; dust with cinnamon or cocoa and place
on cookie sheet. Bake 25 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove
from oven and cool on baking sheet. When cool enough to handle, use a
serrated knife to slice logs on the diagonal into 1/2-inch-wide
pieces. Place cut side down on cookie sheet and return to oven 8 to
10 minutes or until lightly golden. Cool on racks. Dip in melted
chocolate, if desired, and let dry on wax paper. When chocolate is
completely dried and hardened, store in tins up to 1 month.

Yield: about 48 Biscotti
