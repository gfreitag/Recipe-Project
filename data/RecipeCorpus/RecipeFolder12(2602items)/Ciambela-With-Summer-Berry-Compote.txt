Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
1 pt Blueberries
1 pt Blackberries
1 pt Raspberries
Juice of 1/2 lemon
3 tb Sugar
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Baking powder
8 tb Cold sweet butter, cut into
1/2    -inch dice plus 1
Tablespoon
1 lg Egg
1 ts Almond extract
1/4 c  Cold milk
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a medium saucepan, combine berries, lemon juice and sugar. Place
over medium heat and cook until just boiling, about 5 to 6 minutes.
Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Place flour, sugar and baking powder in a food processor and pulse
quickly to blend. Add cold butter and pulse quickly until mixture
resembles fine bread crumbs. In a separate bowl, beat egg, almond
extract and milk until smooth. With food processor going, add liquid
all at once and blend 10 to 15 seconds, until just forming a ball.
Remove dough from processor to a well-floured cutting board. Shape
the dough into a log about 14 inches long and 1-1/2 inches tall.
Grease a cookie sheet with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and lay
the log in a round in center. Place in a preheated oven and bake for
30 to 35 minutes, until light golden brown. Remove and allow to cool
to room temperature. Cut into slices about 1-inch thick, top with 2
tablespoons of berry compote and serve.
