Using a long handled fork char tomatoes over an open flame, turning
them, until skins are blackened, 2 to 8 minutes. (Alternatively,
broil tomatoes on a rack of a broiler pan about 4 inches from heat,
turning, until skins are blistered and charred, 15 to 25 minutes.)
Transfer tomatoes to a plate and let stand until cool enough to
handle. Peel and core tomatoes and chop coarse. In a bowl toss
tomatoes with remaining ingredients and season with salt and pepper.
Let relish stand, covered, at room temperature 3 hours to develop
flavors. Relish may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. Serve
relish at room temperature.
