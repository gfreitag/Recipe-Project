Title: Twice-Baked Potatoes With Basil And Sour Cream
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
4 md Yukon Gold or other
Yellow-fleshed potatoes
(about 1 3/4 pounds)
2 1/2 tb Unsalted butter, softened
1/4 c  Milk
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 c  Packed fresh basil leaves
1/4 c  Sour cream
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

With a fork prick potatoes and on a baking sheet bake in middle of
oven 1 hour, or until tender. Leave oven on. When potatoes are just
cool enough to handle, halve lengthwise and scoop flesh into a
3-quart saucepan, leaving 1/4-inch thick shells. With a potato masher
mash potatoes in saucepan with 3 tablespoons butter. Stir in milk and
salt and pepper to taste. Transfer shells to baking sheet and brush
insides with remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Season shells with salt
and pepper. Mashed potatoes and shells may be prepared up to this
point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Reheat mashed potatoes before
proceeding.

Bake potato shells in middle of oven until golden, about 20 minutes.
While shells are baking, cut basil into thin strips and stir about
three fourths into warm mashed potatoes. Spoon mashed potatoes into
shells and bake until heated through, about 10 minutes. Serve each
potato half topped with 1/2 tablespoon sour cream and some remaining
basil.
