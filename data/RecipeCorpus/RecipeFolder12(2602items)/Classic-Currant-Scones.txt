Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Currants, soaked in boiling
Water for 15 minutes
4 c  Flour
1/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Baking powder
1 ts Salt
8 tb Cold unsalted butter, cut
Into bits
1 3/4 c  Half-and-half
1    Egg, beaten with 1 teaspoon
Sugar, for glaze
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Drain currants and pat dry. Into a
large bowl sift together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add
butter and blend with a pastry blender or your fingertips until it
forms fine crumbs. Add currants and mix well.

Add half-and-half, and stir with a fork just until it comes together
and forms a dough. Turn out onto lightly floured work surface and
knead for 1 minute. Roll out into a 3/4-inch thick round. Use a
lightly floured 3-inch cookie or biscuit cutter to stamp out rounds.
Pat together scraps and reroll. Place on a greased cookie sheet and
brush tops with egg glaze. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until puffed
and golden brown.

Yield: About 30 Scones
