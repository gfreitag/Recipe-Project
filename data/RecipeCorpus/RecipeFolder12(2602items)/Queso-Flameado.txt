Title: Queso Flameado
Categories: 2hot
Yield: 4 servings
12    To 18 ounces Panela cheese
1/2 c  Flour
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 c  Gold tequila
Lime juice, to taste
Slice the cheese 1/2inch thick and place in a bowl of ice water for
about 5 minutes. Pat the cheese dry and dust with the flour, shaking
off any excess.

Heat a large cast iron skillet, over a high heat. Add the oil and fry
the cheese, turning once, until golden brown. USE CAUTION: Standing
far enough back so you do not get near the flames, ignite the
tequila. Let the flames die out.

Remove the cheese and tequila to a platter and finish with a
sprinkling of lime juice. Serve with pickled chipotle peppers and
warm corn tortillas.
