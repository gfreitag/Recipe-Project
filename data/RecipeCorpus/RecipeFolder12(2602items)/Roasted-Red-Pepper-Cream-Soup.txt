6 lg Red bell peppers
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped onions
1 tb Minced garlic
1 tb Chopped basil, plus basil

heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.
Puree red pepper mixture in food processor until smooth, about 2
minutes. Return red pepper soup to pan with remaining cream and heat
on medium-low heat before serving, garnished with basil chiffonade.
