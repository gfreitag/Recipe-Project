Title: Jicama Pancakes
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Shredded jicama (see Note)
Juice of I lemon
2 tb Grated onion
I large egg, beaten
I tablespoon all-purpose
Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Minced habanero chile
1    Russet potato, peeled
3 tb Vegetable oil, or as needed
Toss the jicama in a colander with the lemon juice and let sit for 15
minutes. Using your hands, squeeze as much water as you possibly can
out of the jicama, a handful at a time. Spread on a doubled layer of
paper towels and blot with more paper towels. In a large bowl, toss
the jicama with the onion, egg, flour, salt, and chili. Toss well to
be sure the chile is evenly distributed in the mixture. Grate the
potato into the bowl on the largest hole of the grater and toss again.

In a large cast-iron skillet, heat I tablespoon of the oil over
medium-high heat until very hot. Form the mixture into 2 1/2-inch
patties and saute them in batches, turning with a metal spatula when
brown on one side, until crisp and brown. Add more oil to the skillet
as necessary and keep the pancakes warm on a paper towel-lined baking
sheet in a warm oven while you finish cooking the rest. Serve warm.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings

Note: remove the outer brown layer of skin from the jicama. Shred on
the largest hole of a grater.
