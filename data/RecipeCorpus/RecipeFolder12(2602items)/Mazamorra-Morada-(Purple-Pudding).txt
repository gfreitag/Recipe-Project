Soak the purple corn in the 10 cups of cold water overnight. Transfer
the corn to a large pot and measure the soaking liquid. Add enough
water to make 15 cups. Pour the liquid back over the corn, and add
the pineapple, quince, cinnamon sticks, cloves, lemon juice and
sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 2 to 2 1/2
hours.

Remove from the heat, remove the corn cobs and strain the mixture,
pressing against the strainer with a spoon to extract all the juice
from the fruits and spices. There should be about 8 cups of liquid.
If not, place the corn and fruit in a saucepan with water just to
cover and simmer for about 20 minutes. Strain and add amount needed
to total 8 cups. Discard the corn and fruit. Place the liquid in a
heavy saucepan, reserving 1 cup of the liquid.

Add the dried prunes, cherries and apricots to the 7 cups of liquid.

In a small bowl, combine the reserved 1 cup of liquid and the sweet
potato flour or cornstarch. Mix thoroughly with a fork until
dissolved. Pour this mixture back into the saucepan with the liquid
and dried fruits. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking until
the mixture is thick, about 25 minutes.

Remove from the heat and pour the pudding into a deep 2 quart serving
dish or individual ramekins. Let cool. To serve, dust the top with
ground cinnamon.

Serve the pudding with crema.
