the water. Add this to the stock pot with remaining water, bouquet
garni and tomato. Bring the liquid slowly to a boil, skimming often.
Simmer for 4 5 hours, skimming occasionally and replenishing the
water to keep the level of water somewhat constant.

Strain and discard solids; let stock come to room temperature and
chill. When chilled, discard surface fat. Bring back to a simmer and
adjust for seasoning. If too weak for your taste, reduce, the season
with salt.

If you want to concentrate it, keep on reducing and transferring to a
smaller pot until you have the consistency you want.
