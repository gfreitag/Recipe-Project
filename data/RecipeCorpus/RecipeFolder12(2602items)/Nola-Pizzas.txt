Title: Nola Pizzas
Categories: Emeril, Breads, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
Basic Dough
1    Tablespoon yeast
1    Cup warm water (110 degrees)
1/4    Cup olive oil
3    -to 4 cups flour
2    Teaspoons salt
In a electric mixing bowl, whisk the yeast, water and oil together,
to make a paste. Add the flour and salt and mix, using a dough hook,
until the dough comes away from the sides and crawls up the dough
hook. Remove the dough from the bowl. Grease the bowl with olive oil
and place the dough back in the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic
wrap and let the dough rise until double in size, about an hour. Turn
the dough out onto a floured surface and divide dough into four ounce
portions. Roll the dough into balls, cover and let the dough rest for
15-20 minutes. The dough is ready to be shaped into four individual
pizzas. Press the dough out for two pizzas.
