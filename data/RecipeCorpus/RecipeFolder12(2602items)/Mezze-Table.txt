Mezze, maza, meze, mezeler, mezedes, mezza, mezethakia, meza, al
mezah: There are as many different names for mezze as there are
languages along the eastern rim of the Mediterranean, and there are
as many different mezze dishes as there are cooks to invent them.
Mezze is a way of eating; as with tapas or antipasti, almost anything
that is small and tasty qualifies as a mezze dish, even main dishes
if they can be served in small portions. Mezze dishes are often
served as hors d'oeuvres to accompany drinks, or set out as a first
course. But when served with plenty of fresh warm flatbreads, even
the most humble array can instantly become a meal. And the mezze
table is one of the all-time great ways of giving bread a central
role in a meal, whether a simple home-style supper or a dazzling
festive spread.

A basic mezze meal can be as simple as a basket of warm pita, a plate
of fresh herbs, another of feta cheese or yogurt cheese, a dish of
olives, and a pitcher of iced water.  Add a dip or salsa, a salad or
two, and a grill such as Grilled Marinated Chicken, and a simple
light meal becomes a more elaborate dinner.

Keep in mind that whatever is served should be easy to pick up or to
eat with flatbreads.  Place all the breads and dishes on the table at
the same time.  There are no courses in a mezze meal, no rules about
what must be eaten first and what later.  Think of a long summer
night on the Mediterranean with plenty of time to eat, to talk, and
to eat some more. A mezze meal should be as informal and relaxing as
it is delicious.

To give a mezze meal the status of a mezze feast, simply increase the
number and variety of dishes, including perhaps a few heartier
choices like kebabs or one or two bean dishes.  When making your
selections about what to serve, think also about how the table will
be arranged, about colors and shapes, contrasts and complements.
Place a rich red salsa beside a pale cream-colored dip, a white feta
next to the black olives, an orange or a carrot salat near a plate of
fresh green herbs.
