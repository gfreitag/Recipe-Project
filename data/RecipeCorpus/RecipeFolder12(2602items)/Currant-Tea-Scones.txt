Title: Currant Tea Scones
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  All purpose bleached flour
1/3 c  Sugar
1 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
6 tb Unsalted butter
3/4 c  Currants
1 1/4 c  Milk, cream or buttermilk
Egg wash:
1    Egg beaten well with a pinch
Salt
Line a cookie sheet with parchment or foil. Preheat oven to 450
degrees and set a rack in the middle level.

Combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Cut butter
into 12 pieces and rub evenly into dry ingredients, until mixture has
the appearance of meal. Add currants.

Stir milk into flour and butter mixture to form a smooth dough. Knead
lightly once or twice to complete mixing. Press and roll dough on a
lightly floured surface about 1/4-inch thick, to a 10 by 15-inch
rectangle. Roll dough up, as for a jelly roll, then flatten dough and
fold in half. Roll dough 1/2-inch thick. Cut scones with a floured,
plain or fluted, 2-inch round cutter. Transfer cut scones to paper
lined pan and brush tops carefully with egg wash. Allow wash to dry
10 minutes and apply a second coat. Bake scones 15 minutes, being
careful that they do not color too deeply, or until they are firm,
but not dry.

Yield: a dozen scones
