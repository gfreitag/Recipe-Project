Title: Espresso Tuile
Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Corn syrup
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
6 oz Butter softened
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
2/3 c  Crushed espresso beans
1 c  Chopped pecans
Combine salt, brown sugar and corn syrup in mixer bowl with paddle
attachment.  Add flour, butter and vanilla extract, mix well.  Add
espresso beans and pecans.  Place the batter in heaping tablespoons
on non-stick baking sheet - 3 cookies at a time.  Bake in preheated
350 oven 8 to 10 minutes.  Watch carefully.  Remove cookie sheet from
the oven. Peel off, one at a time, from the sheet.  Drape over 3
pieces of crumpled shaped parchment paper.  Timing here is important.
If cookies become too hard before draping, place in oven to soften.
Cookies, if too soft, will tear, and if too hard, cookies will crack
when removing from the cookie sheet.
