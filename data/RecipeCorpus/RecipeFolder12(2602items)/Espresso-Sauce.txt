Title: Espresso Sauce
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Whole milk
1    Vanilla bean
4    Egg yolks
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  Strong espresso coffee
Pour the milk into a heavy-bottomed pot.  On a cutting board, split
the vanilla bean down the middle and, using the tip of your knife,
scrape all the seeds into the milk.  Add the bean pod and bring the
milk gently to a boil over medium heat, being careful not to scorch
the milk or allow it to boil over.  Reduce the heat to moderately low
heat and cook uncovered for 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and
allow the vanilla bean to steep in the milk for another 5 minutes.
Remove and discard vanilla pod.

Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl of an electric mixer, whip the egg yolks
and sugar together at medium speed for 5 minutes.  Add 1/4 cup of the
scalded milk in a stream, whisking, to the egg mixture to temper it
and whisk the egg mixture back into the milk.  Cook over moderately
low heat, stirring constantly, until custard is thick enough to coat
the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, strain through a fine
sieve into a bowl and cool completely over an ice water bath before
serving.
