dough to circle 1/8 inch thick.  Roll out from center, lifting dough,
turning it, and occasionally flipping to prevent sticking, Flour
board as necessary. Fold dough in half and lift, centering over a 10
inch tart pan with removable bottom.  Place dough in pan and unfold,
and gently press it evenly into bottom and sides of pan. Create a lip
at top by pressing dough between flutes of pan with your fingers as
you pinch dough off at the edge. Then, for an even crust, roll a
rolling pin across the top. Fill tart pan with parchment paper and
then with dried beans, rice, or pie weights. Bake 10 minutes until
partially set, remove parchment and weights, and return to oven for
another 1015 minutes until golden brown. Remove from oven and let
cool on a rack.  When tart shell is cool, fill it with pastry cream,
using an offset spatula to smooth cream evenly in the pan. Working
from the outside in, construct concentric circles of fruit in a
cheerful design on top of the cream. Lightly brush top of fruit with
jam glaze. Serve as soon as possible, ideally within 6 hours.
