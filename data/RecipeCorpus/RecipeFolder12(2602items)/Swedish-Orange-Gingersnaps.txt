Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2    Sticks unsalted butter
1 c  Brown sugar
1 lg Egg
2 tb Plus 1 teaspoon molasses
1 tb Orange juice
1 tb Finely grated orange zest
2 3/4    To 3 cups flour
1 ts Baking soda

2 ts Ground cinnamon
2 ts Ground ginger
Cream together the butter and sugar until light. Beat in 1 egg and
mix in the molasses, orange juice, and zest. Sift together the dry
ingredients and stir them into the wet ingredients to make a soft,
smooth dough, adding more flour if dough is too sticky. Knead the
dough three times on a lightly floured board.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Shape the dough into 3 logs, about
8-inches long, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour
or overnight. Slice logs into thin circles, less than 1/8-inch thick.
Place on lightly greased baking sheets.

Bake cookies for about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and transfer
cookies to a rack to cool.

Yield: 5 dozen cookies
