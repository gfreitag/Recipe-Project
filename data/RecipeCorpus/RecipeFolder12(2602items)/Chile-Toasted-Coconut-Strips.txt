Title: Chile Toasted Coconut Strips
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1    Fresh coconut
1    To 2 tablespoons chile
Powder
1    To 2 teaspoons coarse salt,
Or to taste
Juice of 1 lime
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Poke holes in the three soft areas
at the top of the coconut shell with an ice pick or nail. Drain the
milk and save for another use.

Place the coconut on a sheet pan and bake 10 minutes, until shell and
flesh separate. Reduce oven to 300 degrees.

Crack the shell open with a hammer. Remove and discard shell, leaving
the brown skin on.

Cut the coconut meat into thin strips using a vegetable peeler or
slicing side of the grater. Toss in a bowl with remaining ingredients.

Arrange the seasoned coconut strips in a single layer on a baking
sheet. Toast oven, 10 to 12 minutes, stirring frequently, until
golden brown. Cool and store in an airtight container.

Yield: about 1 quart toasted strips
