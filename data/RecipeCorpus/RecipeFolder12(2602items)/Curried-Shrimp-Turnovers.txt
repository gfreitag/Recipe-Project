Title: Curried Shrimp Turnovers
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Store-bought puff pastry
2 tb Butter
1 sm Onion, diced (about 1/2
Cup)
1 sm Carrot, diced (about 1/2
Cup)
1 sm Apple, peeled, cored, and
Diced (about 1/2 cup)
1/2 lb Small shrimp
2 tb Curry powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1    Egg yolk beaten with 2
TB cold water
Using a round pastry cutter, cut the pastry into 2-inch rounds,
placing each round on a waxed paper lined cookie sheet. Roll the
remaining scrap into a ball and roll out, using a rolling pin, into a
1/4-inch thick sheet and continue to cut rounds of puff pastry until
you've used it all up. Refrigerate the rounds until the filling is
ready.

Heat a saute pan over medium heat for 1 minute. Add the butter, and
when it begins to foam, add the diced onion. Cook the onion until it
is translucent, add the carrot and apple and saute for 2 minutes. Add
the shrimp and cook for 2 minutes, then sprinkle with curry powder
and stir to combine well. Season with salt and pepper, remove from
heat, and spoon the mixture onto a flat pan (such as a cookie sheet)
and cool for several minutes. Put shrimp in refrigerator and chill
throughly.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Lightly brush a round of pastry with some of the egg wash. Place 1
teaspoon of the shrimp filling in the center of the pastry and fold
the dough in half to encase the filling and create a dumpling.
Continue to fill the pastry rounds in this way until all of the
filling and pastry has been used up. Place the finished turnovers on
a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. Brush the tops of the turnovers
with the remaining egg wash and bake for 12 to 15 minutes just before
you are ready to serve them. They may be held, unbaked and
refrigerated, for up to 48 hours for later use. Serve hot.

Yield: 24 to 36 turnovers.
