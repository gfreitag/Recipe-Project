Title: Panuchos
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1/2    Recipe Masa (recipe
Follows)
1/4 c  Refried Black Beans (recipe
Follows), or good quality
Canned
Refried beans, pureed
Approximately 2/3 cup
Vegetable oil
2 c  Shredded roasted chicken
1 c  Roasted Tomato Salsa (recipe
Follows)
1 c  Pickled Red Onions (recipe
Follows)
1    Avocado, peeled, seeded and
Sliced, for garnish
Divide the masa into 12 pieces and form each into a ball. Press or
roll each into a 4-inch circle.

Heat a dry cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat and
cook the tortillas.

When cool enough to handle, pick up each puffed tortilla and make a 1
1/2-inch slit about 1/4-inch from the edge to make a pocket, being
careful not to cut all the way through the tortilla. Stuff 2
teaspoons of the bean puree in each pocket. Flatten to seal and
spread the beans evenly. Reserve the stuffed tortillas on a tray
covered with a barely damp cloth.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Fry
the stuffed tortillas in batches, adding more oil as necessary, until
they are a little crisp around the edges but still pliable. Drain on
paper towels. Then place on a tray and keep warm in a 200 degree oven.

Heat the chicken in a small pan over low heat.

Remove the tray of panuchos from the oven. Top each with a scant
tablespoon of roasted tomato salsa. Sprinkle on the chicken and
pickled onions and top each with a small avocado slice. Serve warm or
at room temperature.

Variation: In case your tortillas do not puff, here is an alternative
plan: fry them as is in the oil, and then spread with a very fine
layer of beans followed by the other ingredients. They will still
taste delicious.
