Title: Pollito Tia Clara
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1    (3 pound) roasting chicken,
Free-range if possible
3    Cloves garlic, finely
Chopped
Salt
2 tb Paprika
1/4    Red wine vinegar
1/3 c  Spanish olive oil
4    Plum tomatoes, peeled,
Seeded, and chopped (or use
Canned plum tomatoes)
2 md Onions, finely chopped
3 tb Unsalted butter, cut into 4
Pieces
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Finely chopped parsley, for
Garnish
Rinse the chicken, remove any excess fat from around the vent, and
pat dry with paper towels. In a small bowl, mix together the garlic,
1 teaspoon salt, paprika, and vinegar. Use this mixture to rub all
over and inside the cavity of the chicken. Cover the chicken and let
it sit on a platter for 1 hour.

Heat a large castiron skillet over mediumhigh heat and add the olive
oil. Shake the chicken from both ends to drain off the excess
vinegar. Using kitchen tongs and a large wooden spoon to steady the
bird, brown it on all sides in the hot oil. This will take a good 10
to 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large enamel and castiron
casserole, combine the tomatoes, onions, butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt
and the black pepper. Add 1/2 cup water and set the chicken on top of
this mixture.

Roast the chicken for 20 minutes per pound, or until the thigh meat
is done through with no trace of pink remaining. Transfer the chicken
to a warm serving platter and cover loosely with aluminum foil, while
you tip the casserole to one side and spoon off the excess fat. Carve
the chicken into serving pieces as desired, and serve with some of
the vegetables from the pan, sprinkled with the parsley.
