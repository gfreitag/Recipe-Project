Title: Milanese Pear And Chocolate Tart
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Unbleached flour
1/4 c  Sugar
1/8 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking powder
3 tb Cocoa powder
4 tb Unsalted butter
1 lg Egg
Chocolate Crumb Topping:
1 c  Unbleached flour
1/3 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Cocoa powder
1    Stick butter, melted
Pear Filling:
4    Ripe Bartlett pears
3 tb Sugar
2 tb Butter, melted
1 tb Pear eau-de-vie
Lightly butter a 10-inch tart pan.

For dough, combine dry ingredients except cocoa in a mixing bowl. Sift
cocoa into bowl through a fine strainer.  Rub in butter with
fingertips, keeping mixture cool and powdery.  Beat egg with a fork
and stir in. Continue stirring until dough is evenly moistened,
pressing it together well.  Shape dough into a disk, wrap and chill.
For crumbs, combine flour and sugar in a bowl; sift in cocoa and mix.
Stir in butter and allow to stand a few minutes.  Break up into
coarse crumbs. Set a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat
oven to 350 degrees. Roll dough on a floured surface and line the
prepared pan, pressing dough in well. For filling, peel, halve, core
and slice pears into a bowl and toss with remaining ingredients.
Pour filling into lined pan, smooth top and scatter crumbs over
surface.  Bake the tart about 30 to 35 minutes, until the crust and
crumbs are baked through and the filling is bubbling. Cool on a rack
and serve tart at room temperature.
