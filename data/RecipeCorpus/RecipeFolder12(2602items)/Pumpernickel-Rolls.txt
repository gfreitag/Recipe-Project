Title: Pumpernickel Rolls
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Active dry yeast
1 c  Warm water
1 tb Melted butter
1 ts Sugar
6 tb Dark molasses
1 tb Caraway seeds
1/2 c  Mashed potatoes
3 tb Melted semi-sweet chocolate
2 c  Rye flour
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 c  Cornmeal
1/4 c  Flour
1    Egg , slightly beaten
2 tb Poppy seeds
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl dissolve the yeast
in the water. Add the butter, sugar, and molasses and mix well. Stir
in the caraway seeds, potatoes, chocolate, rye and wheat flours, and
the cornmeal. Using your hands, mix the ingredients together, do not
over handle. Form into a smooth ball. Grease a bowl, turn the dough
into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise
for 1 1/4 hours or until double in size. Flour the work surface and
turn the dough out onto the floured surface and punch down. This will
allow any gases to escape. Using your hands flatten the dough into a
circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the dough into pieces and form each
into a roll about 3 inches in diameter. Place the rolls on a
parchment lined baking sheet. Brush the rolls with the egg wash and
sprinkle with the poppy seeds. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden
brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.

Yield: 18 rolls
