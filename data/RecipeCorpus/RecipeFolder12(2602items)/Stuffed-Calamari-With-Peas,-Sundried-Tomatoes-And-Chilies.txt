Title: Stuffed Calamari With Peas, Sundried Tomatoes And Chilies
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
8 lg Whole calamari, about 1/2
Pound
4 tb Virgin olive oil
1 lb Fresh peas, shelled to yield
3/4    Cup, blanched and refreshed
2    Cloves garlic, thinly
Sliced
1/2 c  Sundried tomatoes, soaked
1/2    Hour in warm water
1 1/2 c  Fresh breadcrumbs
1 bn Italian parsley, finely
Chopped to yield 1/4 cup
1 1/2 c  Dry white wine
1 c  Basic tomato sauce
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Clean the calamari. Remove the tentacles, finely chop them and set
aside. Remove insides, being careful not to cut the stomach. In a 12
to 14-inch saute pan, heat oil until smoking. Add calamari tentacle
pieces and cook until opaque. Add peas, garlic and sundried tomatoes
and stir through, about 1 minute. Add bread crumbs and stir to coat.
Season with salt and pepper and add parsley. Allow mixture to cool.
Stuff bread mixture into each calamari until full and place in a 12
by 8-inch earthenware dish (just large enough to hold calamari and
sauce). Add wine and tomato sauce and stir to settle. Place in oven
and bake 35 minutes. Remove and serve.
