Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
8 tb (1 stick) unsalted butter
1/2    Loaf French bread or
Baguette, with crust, cut
Into small cubes
1 lb Brown sugar
1 1/2 c  Water
1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
2 lg Granny Smith apples, peeled,
Cored and chopped
1 c  Walnuts, chopped
1/2 lb Cream cheese, chilled and
Chopped
Crema or heavy cream for
Garnish
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9 x 13inch glass
casserole or lasagna pan.

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan, add the bread cubes and stir to
coat evenly. Spread the cubes on a baking sheet and bake 15 minutes
or until lightly brown and crisp. Remove the bread and turn the oven
temperature up to 400 degrees F.

Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove
from the heat. Stir in the cinnamon and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped apples, walnuts, cream
cheese and toasted bread cubes. Drizzle with the reserved sugar syrup
and mix to evenly distribute. Transfer the mixture to the prepared
pan.

Bake, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Then bake an
additional 5 minutes, without stirring, until the top is golden brown
and crusty and the liquid is almost gone. Serve warm with pitchers of
crema or heavy cream for adding at the table.
