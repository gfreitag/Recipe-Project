in the skillet, add it to the large bowl with the ham, 2 cups of the
bread cubes, crushed fine in a plastic bag, the remaining 1 cup bread
cubes, left whole, the hazelnuts, the parsley, the eggs, the salt,
and the pepper, and combine the mixture well. The stuffing may be
made up to 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.
