Title: Ricotta Mascarpone Blintzes With Rhubarb-Strawberry Compo
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
6 oz Ricotta cheese
6 oz Mascarpone
1 ts Sugar
3/4 ts Vanilla extract or orange
Liquor
1 ts Lemon zest
pn Salt
6 c  Rhubarb, cut into 1-inch
Pieces
3 c  Strawberries, cut in half
Lengthwise
3 tb Flour
2 c  Sugar
Lemon juice to taste
Mix together the ricotta, mascarpone, sugar, vanilla extract, lemon
zest and a small pinch of salt.

With the cooked side in, place the "tail" of the crepe toward you and
spoon about 2 ounces of the filling inside the center of the wrapper.
Fold and hold the two opposite sides of the crepe over the filling
until they almost meet and then fold the "tail" over the ingredients
pulling the stuffing toward you. Fold the crepe over until you form a
seam on the blintz. Set finished 2-inch by 1 1/2-inch flat "eggroll"
shaped blintz on a dry towel with the seam side down.

Melt butter or margarine in a skillet over medium high heat,
beginning with the seam side down. Saute each blintz until golden
brown, carefully so the cheese does not escape. Flip the blintz onto
the other side. To warm the ingredients in the blintz, lower the
flame and cook slowly, about 2 to 5 minutes to avoid burning the
crepe.

Gently toss the rhubarb, strawberries, flour, sugar and lemon and let
stand until moist, 5 to 10 minutes. In a large saucepan, melt the
butter and add the fruit mixture. Cook the fruit for approximately 35
minutes, stirring to make sure the fruit does not brown. Cover 5
minutes or until rhubarb is soft. Ladle the warm fruit over the
blintz and top with a dollop of whipped cream. Garnish with a fresh
strawberry half.
