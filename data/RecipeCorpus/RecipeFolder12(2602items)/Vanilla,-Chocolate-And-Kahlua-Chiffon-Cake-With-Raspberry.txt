Title: Vanilla, Chocolate And Kahlua Chiffon Cake With Raspberry
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Sifted cake flour
1 1/2 c  Sugar, divided
3 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Sunflower oil
2 tb Kahlua or other coffee
Flavored liqueur
2 tb Pure vanilla extract
7 lg Egg whites
1 ts Cream of tartar
Nonstick cooking spray or
Oil to brush on baking pan
Port Wine and Raspberry
Sauce
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Into a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, 1 cups of the
sugar, the cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make a
well in the center and add the oil, Kahlua and vanilla. Do not mix.

In another bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar until white
and foamy. Slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue
beating until stiff peaks form. Do not overbeat. Mix 1/4 of the egg
whites until well incorporated into the flour mixture. Gently fold in
the remaining egg whites using a rubber spatula.

Spray a 9-inch tube pan with nonstick cooking spray, or brush the
inside with oil. Dust with flour and tap out the excess. Pour the
batter into the prepared pan. Bang the mold on the counter to remove
any air bubbles. Bake for 55 minutes, or until the top feels springy,
or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool
the cake upright on a wire rack for 1 hour. Loosen the sides with a
small, thin knife. Remove the cake from the pan and allow it to cool.
Wrap airtight, or serve immediately with a light sifting of
confectioners' sugar accompanied by the Port Wine and Raspberry Sauce.
