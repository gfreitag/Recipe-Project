In a sauce pot, bring the Yukon Gold potatoes, covered with salted
water, bring up to a boil.  Reduce the heat and cook until the
potatoes are tender, about 8-10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and
drain. Place the potatoes back on the stove and cook for 1-2 minutes.
This will dehydrate the potatoes.  Add the butter, cream, and truffle
oil. Using a hand masher, mash the potatoes until almost smooth.
Season with salt and pepper. Using a mandoline, slice the potatoes
into shoestrings. In a mixing bowl, tossed the potatoes with olive
oil and season with salt and pepper. Cover the bottom of a Teflon
sautÂ‚ pan with the shoestring potatoes.  Allow the potatoes to come
up the edges two inches.  Allow the potatoes to cook until golden
brown, about 3-4 minutes.  Flip the potatoes over and finish cooking
until golden brown.  Remove the potato from the pan and form into a
deep tart pan.  Spoon the mashed truffle potatoes evenly over the
potato crust. Sprinkle with the cheese. Place in the oven and bake
until the cheese has melted and the potatoes are heated through,
about 5 minutes. Shave the truffles over the entire tart. Remove the
tart pan and place on a platter. Garnish with chives, cheese, and
truffle oil.
