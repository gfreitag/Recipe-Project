Title: Brandied Peach Custard Pie
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
4    Whole peaches, peeled and
Cut into 1/4 inch wedges
3 tb Butter
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Brandy
Custard
2 c  Heavy cream
4    Eggs
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1    Unbaked pie crust
Shaker with powder sugar
Fresh mint
Pastry bag of whipped cream
Preheat the oven to 450F.

For the peaches: Over high heat, in a saute pan, heat the butter.
When the butter is hot add the sugar. Stir until the sugar is
dissolved. Add the peaches and saute for 5-6 minutes, or until the
sugar starts to turn dark amber in color. Incorporate the brandy into
the peach mixture. Carefully ignite the brandy and flambe the
peaches. Remove from heat and allow to cool, about 10 minutes.

For the custard: In a mixing bowl, whisk all the ingredients together
until fully incorporated. In an unbaked pie crust, spoon the brandied
peaches over the pie crust. Place the crust in the oven and pour the
custard into the shells. This prevents spilling the custard in the
oven. Bake for 1 hour or until the custard sets. Place foil around
the crust for the first 30 minutes and then remove. This keeps the
crust from getting too brown. Allow to cool for about 30 minutes.
Place a slice of the pie on the plate and garnish with powder sugar,
whipped cream, and fresh mint.
