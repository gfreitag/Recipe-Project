Title: Flaky Sweet Pastry (Pate Sucree)
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/4 c  Allpurpose flour
7 tb Unsalted butter, chilled and
Cut into pieces
2 ts Sugar
1/8 ts Salt
3 tb Ice water
Place 1 cup of the flour, the butter, sugar and salt, into a food
processor fitted with the metal blade.  Process 10 seconds, until the
mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the ice water and pulse 10 to
15 times, just until the mixture begins to come together (do not let
it form a ball). Empty the dough out of the machine onto a floured
work surface and gather together by pressing lightly.  If the dough
seems too sticky, gently incorporate more flour.  Shape into a ball,
then flatten into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at
least 1 hour before proceeding with recipe.

Yield: 1 10 to 12 inch tart or four individual tartlets
