Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Vegetable oil
1/2 lb Andouille sausage, finely
Chopped
1/2 c  Chopped onions
1/4 c  Chopped bell peppers
1/4 c  Chopped celery
2 tb Chopped garlic
4 c  Crumbled cornbread
2 c  Chicken stock
Salt and cayenne
4 ea Double cut loin pork chops,
Bone in and about 14 ounces
Each
16 sl Raw bacon
2 c  Veal stock
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large saute pan, over medium
heat, add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. When the oil is hot, add the
andouille sausage and render for about 3 minutes. Add the onions,
bell peppers, and celery. Saute for about 5 minutes or until the
vegetables are wilted. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the
garlic. Add the cornbread and stock and mix well. Season with salt
and cayenne. Cook, stirring, for about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from
heat and stir in the parsley. Cool the dressing. Make a 1 to 2-inch
slit on the side of the pork chop. Season the entire chop with salt
and cayenne.

Stuff each pork chop with a good amount of the stuffing, about 1/2 to
3/4 cup. The chop will be very full. Wrap each chop with 4 slices of
the bacon, making sure that each end of bacon over laps the other. In
a large saute pan, heat the remaining oil. When the oil is hot,
carefully lay the chops in the pan. Sear the chops for about 4 to 5
minutes on one side, or until one side of the bacon is crispy. Flip
the chops over and continue to sear for 4 minutes. Remove the chops
from the heat and place in the oven. Roast the chops for about 6 to 8
minutes for medium. Remove the chops from pan and allow to rest for a
couple of minutes before serving. Deglaze the pan with the veal
stock, reduce and reseason with salt and pepper. Serve the pork chops
with Southern Cooked Greens.
