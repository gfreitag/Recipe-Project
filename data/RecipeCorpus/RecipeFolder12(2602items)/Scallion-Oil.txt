2 bn Fresh green scallions
1 tb Salt
1 c  Oil; neutral flavor
Vegetable such as canola or
Safflower
Wash and trim scallions. Bring large pot of water to a boil. Have a
large bowl of ice water nearby. When water boils, add salt, when it
comes back to the boil, drop in half of the scallions and blanch for
10 seconds. Remove scallions from water with tongs and drop in ice
bath. Plunge remaining scallions for 10 minutes and drop into ice
water. When scallions are thoroughly chilled, drain them and squeeze
dry. Roughly chop the blanched scallions. Place scallions in blender.
Add 1/4 cup oil. Puree scallions, stopping frequently to scrape down
sides of blender, until coarsely pureed. Add rest of oil and whirl
until well blended. Pour mixture through a coarse sieve into a bowl,
then pass again through a fine sieve. Use as garnish. Will hold 2 to
3 days.

Make sure to choose very fresh, very green scallions for the best
flavor and color.
