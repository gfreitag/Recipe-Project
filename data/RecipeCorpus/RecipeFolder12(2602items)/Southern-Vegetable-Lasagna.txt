okra. In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over mediumhigh heat

the tomato sauce, tomato paste, oregano, and wilted greens, stir to
combine, and heat through. Set aside.

Layer half the lasagna noodles in a wellgreased 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking
dish. Cover with half the cottage cheese, half the tomatovegetable
mixture, and half the Mozzarella or Monterey Jack. Repeat the four
layers.

Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until the mixture
is bubbly and the top is lightly browned. Let stand for 10 to 12
