Preheat the grill. In a sauce pan, combine the olive oil, peppers,
crushed red pepper, salt, and black pepper. Bring the liquid up to a
boil and reduce the heat. Simmer the sauce for 4 minutes and remove
from the heat. Stir in the garlic. With a hand held mixer, puree the
sauce until smooth. At this point, allow the sauce to sit for 1 week
under refrigeration before serving. Stir in the cilantro and kosher
salt. Marinate the sliced beef in the piri piri for 3 to 4 hours,
under refrigeration. Remove the beef and make several slits in the
beef about 1/4-inch apart, save the excess sauce for basting. Thread
the meat through the swizzle sticks. Place the skewers on the grill.
Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, basting often with the piri
piri. Place any remaining piri piri in a saucepan and bring up to a
boil. Remove from the heat and serve with the beef. Place the skewers
on a platter and drizzle with the piri piri. Garnish with chopped
cilantro and Essence.
