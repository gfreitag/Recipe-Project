Title: Chocolate Glaze
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Unsalted butter
2 tb Light corn syrup
1/4 c  Dark rum
12 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
Finely chopped
Place all ingredients in a heatproof bowl over a double boiler bottom
filled with simmering water. Allow chocolate to melt completely,
stirring occasionally. Keep warm. If mixture will not be used
immediately, cover and store at room temperature until needed.

(This glaze can also be made in advance as this recipe makes a
generous amount, which can be stored, covered and refrigerated, for a
long period).
