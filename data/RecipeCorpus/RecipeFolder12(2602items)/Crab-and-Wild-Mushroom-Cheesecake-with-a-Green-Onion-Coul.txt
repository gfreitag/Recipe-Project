Cheesecake:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the Parmesan, bread crumbs
and butter until thoroughly blended, and press into a 9-inch
springform pan. In a saute pan, heat the olive oil.  Add the onions,
shallots, garlic and peppers, and saute for 2 minutes.  Stir in the
mushrooms and season with salt and pepper, saute for 1 to 2 minutes,
and remove from heat. Using an electric mixer beat the cream cheese
with the eggs in a large bowl until very thick, about 5 minutes. Beat
in the cream, Gouda, sauteed vegetables and crab meat. Mix until
thoroughly incorporated and creamy, for about 2 minutes.  Pour the
filling over the crust in the springform pan and bake until firm, for
about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool to room
temperature.

For the sauce:  In a small mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients
together, mix to incorporate.

Season with salt and pepper.  Chill.  Spoon a pool of the coulis in
the center of a plate.  Place a piece of the cheesecake in the center
of the coulis.  Garnish with the egg yolks, egg whites, chives, long
chives, capers and red onions.
