Butterfly flank steak: cut steak horizontally through the middle,
leaving in attached at one end, to create a flat, thin rectangular
slice. Generously season both sides with Creole spice. Into a small
bowl squeeze roasted garlic cloves and combine with anchovies,
Parmesan cheese and freshly-ground black pepper; mash, adding enough
olive oil, a few drops at a time, to bind mixture. Spread garlic
mixture evenly over steak. Lay bacon across steak, to cover entire
surface. Roll up long side, jelly roll fashion. Slice roll into 1
1/2-inch thick "pinwheels", securing each one closed with a skewer,
as you cut them. Season with salt and pepper. Grill on preheated hot
grill, 4 minutes per side for medium done. Serve 3 per serving, with
homemade Worcestershire sauce, if desired. Serve garnished with
parsley.
