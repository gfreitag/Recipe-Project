reduce to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes or until the tomatoes soften.
Remove the bay leaves. Using a hand-held blender, puree the soup
until smooth. Chill the soup. Add the lemon juice and hot sauce.
Season with salt. In a mixing bowl, mix the crabmeat, sour cream,
tomatoes, capers and green onions together. Season the salad with
salt and pepper. To serve, ladle the soup into individual bowls and
garnish with the crab salad and crispy ham. The soup can be served
either chilled or warm.
