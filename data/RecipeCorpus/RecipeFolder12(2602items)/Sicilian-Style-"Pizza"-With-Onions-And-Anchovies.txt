Title: Sicilian Style "Pizza" With Onions And Anchovies
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 oz Package of dry yeast
1 c  Warm water
3 c  All purpose flour
1/2 c  Freshly grated pecorino
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
3 tb Extra virgin olive oil
For the sauce:
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
1 lg Onion, peeled and sliced
Thin
1    Garlic clove, peeled and
Minced
3 lg Ripe tomatoes, peeled,
Seeded and diced
2    Anchovy fillets, chopped
2    Sprigs fresh oregano, leaves
Picked off
1/2 c  Fresh bread crumbs
3 tb Extra virgin olive oil
2 oz Caciocacallo, or provolone,
Cut into 1/2-inch dice
Make the dough:

Mix together the yeast and water. In another bowl, mix the flour,
pecorino, salt and pepper. Make a well in the center, mix in the
yeast mixture and olive oil, mixing until you have a smooth elastic
dough, about 8 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with
plastic wrap, leave in a warm place for 1 hour, doubling in size.

Make the sauce:

In a saucepan over medium heat, place the olive oil and saute the
onion and garlic for 10 minutes, or until wilted and golden brown.
Stir in the tomatoes, anchovies, and oregano, simmer for 10 more
minutes. Allow to cool and reserve.

In a skillet over medium heat saute the bread crumbs in 1 tablespoon
of olive oil until golden brown.

Brush a pizza pan with olive oil, roll out the dough, line the pizza
pan and allow it to rise for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425
degrees. With your fingertips make dimples in the dough, 1/2-inch
deep and 1-inch apart all over the dough. Top the dough with half the
sauce, smoothing the sauce to 1/2-inch of the edge. Bake in the oven
for 25 minutes.

Remove from the oven, spoon the rest of the sauce, sprinkle with the
cheese, sprinkle with the bread crumbs and drizzle with the remaining
2 tablespoons olive oil. Bake in the oven for 8 minutes and serve.

Yield: one 12-inch pizza
