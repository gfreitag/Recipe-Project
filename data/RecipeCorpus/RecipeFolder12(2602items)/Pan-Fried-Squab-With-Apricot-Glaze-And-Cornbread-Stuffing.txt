6    Squab
6 sl Bacon
1 lg Yellow onion, chopped
2    Ribs celery, chopped
1/2 c  Dried apricots, chopped
1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
1/2 bn Parsley, chopped

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Wash and dry the squab. In a
medium-size heavy skillet, over a medium heat, fry the bacon until
crisp. Drain on paper and crumble. Reserve the bacon grease.

Add the onion to the skillet and saute 3 to 5 minutes, or until
transparent. Add the celery and cook 2 to 3 minutes more. Add the
dried apricots and stock. Return the bacon to the skillet and add the
parsley.

Place the cornbread in a large bowl. Pour the entire contents of the
skillet over the cornbread and toss well to coat.

Season the squabs inside and out with salt and pepper and stuff with
the cornbread stuffing. Truss the squabs.

In a large cast iron skillet, heat the reserved bacon fat. Saute the
squabs until brown on all sides, turning often. Transfer the squabs
to a baking dish and place in the oven for 15 minutes and reduce heat
to 350 degrees, bake another 20 minutes glazing every 5 minutes. In
the same skillet, saute the chile powder. Add the orange juice and
cook until slightly thickened.

Glaze the squab every 5 minutes as they finish roasting for 15
minutes. Serve with steamed broad beans. Yield: 6 servings
