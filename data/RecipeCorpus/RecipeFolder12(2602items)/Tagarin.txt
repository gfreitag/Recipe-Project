Title: Tagarin
Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 servings
15 1/2 c  All-purpose flour plus 1/2
c  For dusting work surface
8    Egg yolks, jumbo
1 tb Virgin olive oil
1 ts Salt
Use standard well technique, placing yolks only in initial well.

Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil
and any other flavoring you choose. Using a fork, beat together the
eggs, oil and flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour starting
with the inner rim of the well. As you expand the well, keep pushing
the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial
phase looks messy. The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour
is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
hands primarily. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from
the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits. Lightly flour the
board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be
elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes,
remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in
plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Note:
do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are
essential for a light pasta.
