Title: Creamy Polenta With Mascarpone
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
5 c  Milk
1 c  Polenta (medium-grain yellow
Cornmeal, not instant)
5 tb Mascarpone cheese (2 1/2
Ounces)
1 ts Kosher salt
1/8 ts Fresh ground white pepper
3 tb Gorgonzola, crumbled (2
Ounces) (optional)
1/4 c  Shelled walnuts, lightly
Toasted
In a 2-quart, non-reactive saucepan, slowly bring the milk to a boil,
stirring every few minutes with a wooden spoon to prevent scorching.
To avoid lumpy polenta, follow this method carefully: Hold the cup of
polenta in one hand and a firm whisk in the other. Slowly pour the
polenta into the milk with a sprinkling motion, and whisk constantly
until all the polenta is absorbed.

Turn the heat down very low.  Switch back to the wooden spoon and
thoroughly stir the polenta every ten minutes for one hour.  The
polenta should have the consistency of firm mashed potatoes.  It will
have completely lost any raw corn taste or gritty texture. Stir in the
mascarpone and season with salt and white pepper.

Preheat the broiler.  Spoon the polenta into a heat resistant dish,
dot evenly with the crumbled gorgonzola and melt the cheese under the
broiler. Sprinkle with the toasted walnuts and serve.
