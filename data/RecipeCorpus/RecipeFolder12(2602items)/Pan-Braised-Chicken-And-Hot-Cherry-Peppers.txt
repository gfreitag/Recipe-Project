Drain, carefully, all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the chicken and
add the onions. Cook the onions to golden brown. Add the peppers to
the onions and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.

Add the wine and cook for 2 minutes over medium heat. Add the broth
and tomato and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and cover
the pan. Braise the chicken, onions and peppers for 25 to 30 minutes
or until the chicken is fully cooked.

Just before serving, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil, add 1
tablespoon of salt, and cook the noodles until tender. Drain the
noodles, toss with butter and place on a large platter.

Serve the chicken over the noodles and sprinkle freshly chopped
parsley over the top.
