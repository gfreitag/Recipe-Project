Title: Pear Tart (Adapted From Julia Child)
Categories: Taste
Yield: 4 servings
4 oz Unblanched almonds
1/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Flour
1 tb Unsalted butter
2 ts Grated lemon zest
1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
2    Egg yolks
1    10- or 12-inch puff pastry
Round, chilled and pricked
All over with a
Fork
5    Barely-ripe pears (such as
Anjou or Bartlett), peeled
And halved
1 1/2 c  Apricot preserves, heated
And sieved
Unsalted pistachios, chopped
For garnish
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

In a food processor combine almonds, sugar, flour, butter, lemon zest,
vanilla and egg yolks; process to a coarse, granular texture. On a
heavy parchment-lined baking sheet, spread almond mixture evenly over
pastry circle. Using a melon baller, core pears. Slice 8 to 9 of the
pears halves very thin horizontally, holding them to maintain their
shape. Carefully lift and transfer halves to top of tart, arranging
them to fit in a star pattern, narrow ends pointing in. Shape
remaining pear half to fit in center of tart; score top, but do not
slice through.

Bake tart 40 to 45 minutes, until pears are golden brown and tender.
Glaze pears liberally with hot apricot preserves and sprinkle
pistachios in a line down each pear half for garnish.
