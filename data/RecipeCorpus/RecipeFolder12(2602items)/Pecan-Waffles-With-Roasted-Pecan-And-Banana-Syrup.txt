the milk and oil into the egg mixture. Fold the flour mixture into

beaten egg whites into batter , leaving little fluffs of egg whites.
Pour 1 cup batter onto grids of a preheated, lightly greased waffle
iron. Close lid quickly: do not open during baking. Bake according to
the manufacturer's directions for the waffle iron. In a saute pan,
melt the remaining butter. Add the pecan pieces and saute until
golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the banana slices and syrup and
bring the liquid to a simmer.
