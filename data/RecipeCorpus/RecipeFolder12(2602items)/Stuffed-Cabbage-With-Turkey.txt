Cut turkey into quarters and place in 6 quart saucepan with chicken
stock and vinegar. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer until very
tender, about 45 to 50 minutes. Remove turkey pieces carefully and
set aside to cool, leaving stock still bubbling in the pot.

Remove cabbage leaves from core and cook 4 at a time for 2 to 3
minutes, until tender and flexible. Remove, allow to cool in bowl or
in cool water and continue until all the leaves are blanched. Strain
and save the cooking liquid. In a 12 to 14 inch saute pan, heat oil
until just smoking. Add onion and bacon and cook until soft and light
golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Pull turkey apart into 2 inch long shredded pieces. Slice mushrooms
1/4 inch thick and add to onion pan and cook until softened and
fragrant. Add turkey pieces and cook until heated through, about 5 to
6 minutes, and season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and
allow to cool. Add parsley and two-thirds of the tarragon and stir
through. Place drained cabbage leaves on table and place 2 to 3
tablespoons of the turkey mixture in the lower center of each leaf.
Roll up like a burrito to form a package and place, folded side down,
into another 12 to 14 inch saute pan. Add 3 cups of cool cooking
liquid and tomato sauce and shake sauce off of top. Bake 35 minutes.
Remove and serve, 2 pieces per plate.
