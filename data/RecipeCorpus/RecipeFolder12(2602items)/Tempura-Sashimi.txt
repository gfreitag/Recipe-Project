Title: Tempura Sashimi
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
6 oz Sushi rice
4 oz Rice wine vinegar
3 oz Ground toasted sesame seeds
4    Nori seaweed sheets
6 oz Trimmed and skinned Ahi
Tuna
6 oz Himachi (yellow tail) white
Tuna
4    Spring roll paper wrappers
8 oz Peanut oil
13 oz Wasabi mustard sauce
Soy sauce
Place 6 ounces of sushi rice and 1 pint of cold water in a sauce pot.
Bring the ingredients to a boil, cover the sauce pot, then turn down
to a simmer. Cook until all the water is gone, and rice is cooked
nice and sticky. Then, turn out rice on a film covered sheet pan, and
season with rice wine vinegar and sesame seeds. Cover with more clear
film wrap. In a toaster oven or regular oven, place nori sheet on a
sheet pan at 250 degrees for 30 seconds. Seaweed should be lightly
toasted, not crisp, just warm. Lay out the seaweed. Pat the rice on
the seaweed with your fingers then place pieces of Ahi or Himachi in
the center. With a sushi mat, roll the tuna roll, cutting off excess
seaweed, then roll in rice paper. Fry in 350 degree oil for 2 minutes
then slice and serve with wasabi and soy sauce.
