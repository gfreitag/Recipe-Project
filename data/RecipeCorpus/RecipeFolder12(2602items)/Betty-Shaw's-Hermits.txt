Set a rack at the middle level of the oven. Preheat to 350 degrees.
In an electric mixer beat together the butter and brown sugar on
medium speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a
time, and beat until each is incorporated, scraping the bowl
occasionally with a rubber spatula. Combine the flour, baking soda,
cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and salt and add half to the butter mixture.
Mix at low speed. Add molasses and buttermilk, then remaining dry
ingredients. By hand, fold in the raisins and nuts. Pour the batter
into the prepared jelly-roll pan and bake for about 15 minutes or
until the center is set. Let cool in the pan on a rack. When
completely cool, cut into 2-inch squares.

Storage: Keep hermits tightly covered at room temperature or wrap in
plastic and freeze.

Yield: 36 two inch squares
