Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Olive oil
3 oz Andouille sausage, finely
Chopped
1/2 c  Minced onions
2 ts Chopped garlic
2 c  Cubed potatoes, blanched
2 c  Veal reduction
1/4 c  Chopped green onions
4    6-ounce salmon fillets
1 1/4 c  Sweet barbecue sauce
Salt and pepper
1/2 c  Flour
1    Onion, cut into thin rings
2 c  Vegetable oil
1 tb Finely chopped parsley
In a saut pan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil. When the oil is hot, add
the Andouille sausage and render for 3 minutes. Add the onions and
saut for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and potatoes and saut for 1
minute. Season with salt and pepper. Add the veal reduction and green
onions. Bring the liquid up to a boil. Reduce the sauce to a simmer
and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep warm.
Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. In a saut pan, heat
the remaining olive oil. When the oil is hot, sear the salmon for 2
minutes on each side. Remove the pan from the heat and brush each
fillet with a tablespoon of the barbecue sauce. Place the pan in the
oven and roast for 2 to 3 minutes for medium rare. Season the flour
with salt and pepper. Dredge the onions in the seasoned flour. In a
saut pan, heat the vegetable oil. When the oil is hot, add the onion
rings and fry until crispy and golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes,
stirring constantly. Remove from the oil and drain on a paper-lined
plate. Season the onions with salt and pepper. To assemble, spoon
about 1/4 cup of the barbecue sauce in the center of each plate.
Spoon 1/2 cup of the hash in the center of the sauce. Lay the salmon
fillet directly on top of the hash. Garnish with the fried onions and
parsley.
