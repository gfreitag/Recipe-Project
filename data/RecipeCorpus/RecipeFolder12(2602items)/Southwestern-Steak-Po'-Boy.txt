Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Emeril's Southwestern Spice,
Recipe follows
1    Flank steak, about 2 pounds
1 lg Loaf of French bread
1/4 c  Creole mustard
1    Poblano pepper, roasted,
Peeled and seeded
6    Tomatillos, roasted
1 bn Green onions, roasted
1    Head of garlic, roasted
1    Beef steak tomato,
Quartered
Juice of 2 limes
1 tb Minced garlic
6    Corn tortillas, cut into
Thin strips
2 c  Guacamole
1/2 c  Cilantro creme fraiche
Preheat the fryer. Preheat the grill. In a mixing bowl, whisk the
olive oil and Southwest Spice together, forming a paste. Rub the
entire steak with the rub and place in a glass pan large enough for
the steak and cover with plastic wrap. Place the steak in the
refrigerator and marinate for at least 4 hours (overnight is best).
Remove from the refrigerator and place on the grill. Cook for 3 to 4
minutes on each side for medium-rare. Remove the steak from the grill
and slice into thin slices. Split the bread in 1/2 and smear both cut
sides of the bread with the Creole mustard. In a food processor,
puree the poblano, tomatillos, onions, and garlic, pulse until full
incorporated. Do not puree the mixture until smooth. Add the tomato,
lime juice, and minced garlic and pulse until incorporated. Season
the salsa with salt and pepper. Fry the tortilla strips in the oil
until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from the strips from the
oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the strips with salt and
pepper. Start building the sandwich with mounding the steak on one
side of the bread. Top the steak with spoonfuls of the salsa. Spoon
the guacamole over the salsa. Drizzle the cilantro creme fraiche over
the guacamole. Place the fried tortilla stripes on top of the
guacamole. Top the sandwich with the other 1/2 of the bread.

Yield: 1 very large sandwich
