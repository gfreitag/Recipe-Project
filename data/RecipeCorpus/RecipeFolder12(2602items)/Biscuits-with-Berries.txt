Categories: Emeril, Breads
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Mixed fresh berries, rinsed
(such as strawberries,
Blueberries
And raspberries) halved if
Necessary
2 tb Sugar
1 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/8 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Cinnamon
2 tb Cold butter, cut in small
Pieces
About 1/4 cup milk
1/2 c  Sweetened whipped cream
Mint sprigs, for garnish
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl toss berries with
sugar and set aside.

In a mixing bowl combine flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda and
cinnamon. Using your fingers, rub in butter until mixture forms coarse
crumbs. Add just enough milk for dough to come together. Divide into 4
pieces and shape each into a nice round biscuit. Transfer biscuits to
a parchment- or waxed-paper-lined baking sheet. Bake 25 minutes,
until tops are golden and bottoms are lightly browned. Split hot
biscuits and spoon berries on bottom halves. Top berries with a
dollop of whipped cream and replace biscuit top. Serve immediately,
garnished with mint.
