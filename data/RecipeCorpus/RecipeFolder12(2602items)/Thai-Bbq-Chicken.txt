Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
2    Stalks fresh lemon grass
2 tb Chopped fresh ginger
2 tb Chopped cilantro
1 1/2 c  Light soy sauce
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Freshly ground black pepper

On the bone
Sweet and Spicy Sauce:
1 tb Finely chopped chiles
1/2 c  White vinegar
1 ts Salt

Remove the grassy tops of the lemon grass, leaving stalks about
6inches long, and cut off any hard root section. Using the blunt edge
of a large knife or cleaver, bruise each stalk all over, then chop.
Combine marinade ingredients in blender, process until smooth and
pour into a nonreactive bowl. Add chicken, turning to coat all over.
Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.

Meanwhile, combine the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan and
bring to a boil while stirring. Reduce heat and simmer 2 to 3
minutes, or until thickened slightly, then remove from heat.

Prepare grill or preheat broiler. Remove chicken from marinade, and
grill or broil breasts and thighs until golden brown on all sides
over high heat, starting chicken skinside down first. Then move
chicken to a medium hot part of the grill or broiler until cooked
through, 20 to 30 minutes total. Serve with Sweet and Spicy Sauce.
