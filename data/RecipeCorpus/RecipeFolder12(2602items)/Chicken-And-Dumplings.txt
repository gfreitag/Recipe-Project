Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Fryer, about 4 pounds
2 c  Chopped onions
1 1/2 c  Chopped celery
1 1/2 c  Chopped carrots
8    Garlic cloves, peeled
4    Bay leaves
4    Sprigs fresh thyme
4 qt Water
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
Cayenne
1    Egg
1 3/4 c  Milk
White pepper
2 tb Baking powder
3 tb Chopped parsley
1 1/4 c  Flour
3 tb Cornstarch
In a large stock pot, combine the chicken, onions, celery, carrots,
garlic, bay leaves, and fresh thyme. Cover with water. Season the
liquid with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Bring the liquid to a boil and
reduce to a simmer. Cook for about 2 hours, or until the chicken is
tender. Drain the mixture, reserving the cooking liquid and 1 cup of
the vegetables. When the chicken has cooled, skin and debone the
chicken. Set the chicken meat aside. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg
and 1 cup of the milk together. Season the mixture with salt and
white pepper. Stir in the baking powder and parsley. Stir in the
flour, mixing to make a thick paste. Fold in 1 cup of the reserved
vegetables. If any fat has risen to top of the broth, skim the fat
off and discard. Return the chicken broth and chicken meat to the
stock pot. Bring the liquid to a boil. In a small bowl, dissolve the
cornstarch in the remaining milk. Whisk the cornstarch mixture into
chicken broth. Bring the liquid back to a boil and reduce to a
simmer. Drop heaping tablespoons of the dumpling batter into the hot
mixture, distributing the dumplings evenly, until all the batter is
used. When the dumplings have risen to the surface, simmer and cook
for 4 minutes, stirring gently. Serve the chicken and dumplings
immediately in soup bowls.
