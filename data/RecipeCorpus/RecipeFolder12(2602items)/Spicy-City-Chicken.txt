Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Unsalted butter
4    Shallots, diced
4 lg Mushrooms, thinly sliced
1 bn Cilantro, stems and leaves
Separated
2    Jalapeno peppers, chopped
With seeds
2 tb Ground cumin
2 c  Chicken stock or canned
Broth
3/4 c  Heavy cream
2    Egg yolks
3 tb Palm sugar or brown sugar
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
3 lb Boneless chicken breasts and
Thighs
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 tb Fresh lime juice
6    Scallions
Make the sauce by melting butter in a skillet. Cook shallots and
mushrooms until soft and golden, about 10 minutes. Add cilantro stems
and 1/2 the leaves, jalapeno peppers, and cumin, lower heat and cook
for 5 minutes. Add chicken stock. Turn heat to high and cook until
liquid is reduced by half. Add cream and return to a boil. Remove
from heat. Puree in a blender, strain, and return to heat.

Whisk egg yolks, sugar, and vinegar together in a small bowl. Pour
one cup pureed sauce into egg mixture to temper. Then combine egg
mixture and puree, and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until
sauce is thick and smooth. Keep warm.

Preheat broiler or prepare grill. Season chicken lightly with salt and
pepper, since sauce will be spicy. Mix oil and lime juice in a small
bowl and brush chicken and scallions with it.

Broil or grill thighs about 12 minutes, breasts about 9 minutes, and
scallions about 2 minutes per side. Always grill chicken skinside down
first.

Arrange grilled chicken over a bed of Basmati Rice and spoon sauce
over all. Garnish with the remaining cilantro leaves and scallions,
and serve immediately.
