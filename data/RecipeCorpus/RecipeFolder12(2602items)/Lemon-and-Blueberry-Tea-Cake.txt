Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Brown sugar
2 1/3 c  Flour
8 tb Butter, room temperature
1 ts Cinnamon
1    Egg
1/2 c  Half and half
1/2 c  Sour cream
Juice of two lemons
2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
2 1/2 c  Fresh blueberries
2 tb Grated lemon juice
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan. In a
small mixing bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the sugar, brown sugar, 1/3 cup
flour, 4 tablespoons butter, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Mix until the
topping is incorporated. Using an electric mixer, cream the remaining
sugar and butter together. Add the egg, half and half, sour cream,
and lemon juice, blend until smooth. In a mixing bowl, sift the
remaining flour, baking powder, salt and remaining cinnamon together.
With the machine running, slowly add the flour until all the flour is
incorporated. Fold in the blueberries and lemon zest. Pour the batter
into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the topping on top of the batter.
Bake the bread for about 50 minutes, or until the top is golden
brown. Remove the pan from the oven and cool for 5 minutes. Remove
the bread from the oven and cool on a wire rack. Slice and serve.
