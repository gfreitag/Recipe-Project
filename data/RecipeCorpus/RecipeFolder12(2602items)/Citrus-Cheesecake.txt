Title: Citrus Cheesecake
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Slivered almonds, toasted
(see Note)
2 1/2 lb Cream cheese, softened
3 tb All purpose flour
1 1/2 c  Sugar
Grated zest of 1 lemon
Grated zest of 2 oranges
5    Eggs
2    Egg yolks
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Sour cream, for garnish
(optional)
Thinly sliced kumquats, for
Garnish (optional)
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Butter a inch round cake pan. Coat
the bottom and sides with the toasted almonds.

In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer at low
speed until soft and smooth, about 1 minute.  Combine the flour and
sugar in another bowl and then add to the beaten cream cheese.  Mix
well, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally.  Beat in the
grated citrus zests. Add the eggs, egg yolks and vanilla extract. Mix
thoroughly, frequently scraping down the sides of the bowl, until the
batter is perfectly smooth.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan, tapping the bottom on a
counter four or five times to eliminate air pockets.  Place the cake
pan inside a large roasting pan and pour in hot tap water until it
reaches halfway up the sides of the cake pan.  Bake 1 hour, or until
the center feels firm when pressed.  Immediately remove the cake pan
from the larger pan and set aside to cool on a rack.  Refrigerate 4
to 6 hours or overnight.

To serve, place the pan over a low burner for about 1 minute to melt
the butter.  Invert onto a plate and then invert again onto a serving
platter so the nuts are on the bottom.  To garnish, if desired,
spread the sour cream evenly over the top and then cover the top with
rows of thinly sliced kumquats.

Yield: 8 to 10 servings

Note:  To toast almonds, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spread the
almonds on a cookie sheet and toast in the oven until golden, about 15
minutes.  Set aside to cool.
