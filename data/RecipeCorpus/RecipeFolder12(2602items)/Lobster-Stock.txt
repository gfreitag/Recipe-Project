Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
4    (1 1/2 pound) lobsters or 4
lb Crayfish
8 tb (1 stick) unsalted butter
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 md Onions, finely chopped
2    Carrots, peeled and chopped
2    Stalks celery, peeled and
Chopped
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Dry white wine
1 c  Madeira

1    Head garlic, with skins, cut

1/2 bn Fresh parsley, with stems

2    Bay leaves
1 1/2 ts Dried tarragon
1 ts Dried thyme
1/2 ts Cayenne
Bring a large stockpot of water to a rolling boil, add lobsters, and
cook at a fast boil until done, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl
of iced water to cool, then remove and reserve tail and claw meat for
another use. Do this messy job over a bowl to reserve drippings.
Crush shells, which will be the base for the stock, using a mallet or
hammer, then grind as fine as possible with reserved drippings in a
food processor.

Melt butter and oil in a large stockpot over mediumhigh heat. Cook
onions, carrots, celery, and salt until golden, about 10 minutes.
Stir in crushed shells, white wine, and Madeira. Turn heat to high
and cook until liquid is reduced by half.

Add clam juice and tomato juice. Bring to a boil and carefully skim
and discard foam that rises to surface. Add remaining ingredients and
cook at a simmer, uncovered, 1 hour 15 minutes.

Strain through a fine sieve and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze
indefinitely.

Yield: 6 3/4 cups
