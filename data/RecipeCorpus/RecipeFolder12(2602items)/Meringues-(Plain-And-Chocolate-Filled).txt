Categories: Baker
Yield: 4 servings
4    Egg whites
1 ts Pure vanilla extract
1 c  Super fine sugar
Chocolate Ganache:
6 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
Broken in pieces
1/2 c  Scalded whipping cream
Preheat oven to 225 degrees. Have egg whites at about 70 degrees. Beat
until foamy in an electric mixer or by hand. Add vanilla. While
continuing to beat, add sugar one tablespoon at a time. When the
mixture stands in stiff peaks on the beater, it is ready for baking.
Fill a pastry bag with mixture and pipe onto parchment covered baking
sheet, using star tip to create kisses?. Bake about 1 hour or longer,
depending on the size. Do not remove from the oven at once, but turn
off the oven, open the door and leave them for at least 5 minutes.
Cool gradually, away from a draft. Remove them from the sheet when
cool.

To prepare chocolate ganache, pour hot, scalded cream over chocolate.
Blend until smooth. Cool.

To fill meringues, crush the bottom lightly with the thumb while still
warm. Fill the hollows with chocolate ganache.

Yield: 3 dozen 1-inch Meringues
