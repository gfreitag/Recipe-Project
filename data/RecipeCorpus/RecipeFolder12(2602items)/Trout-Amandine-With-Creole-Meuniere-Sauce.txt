Title: Trout Amandine With Creole Meuniere Sauce
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
6    (6 to 8-ounce) Gulf speckled
Trout fillets, skinned
Essence
1 c  Milk
2 c  Flour
2 tb Butter
1/3 c  Olive oil
3/4 c  Worcestershire Sauce
2    Whole lemons, skin and pith
Removed
2    Bay leaves
3/4 lb Cold butter, cubed
1 c  Sliced almonds
1 tb Chopped parsley
2 tb Chopped green onions
Season the fillets with Essence. Place the fillets in a glass bowl and
cover with the milk. Cover the bowl and place in the refrigerator.
Refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove the bowl from the refrigerator and
drain. Season the flour with Essence. Dredge the fillets in the
seasoned flour, coating the fillets completely. In a large saute pan,
heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and the olive oil together. When the
oil is hot, pan-fry the fillets for 3 to 4 minutes on each side or
until the fillets are golden. Remove the fillets from the pan and
drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the fillets with Essence. Set
the fish aside. Pour the oil from the skillet, leaving the browned
bits in the pan. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, lemons and bay
leaves. Bring the liquid up to a simmer and simmer the liquid until
it reduces by 2/3, about 4 minutes. Remove the lemon pith. Whisk the
cold butter cubes into the sauce, a cube at a time, until all the
butter is incorporated. The sauce should be thick and coat the back
of a spoon. Stir in the almond slices. To serve, one fillet in the
center of each plate. Spoon the sauce over the fish and garnish with
parsley and green onions.
