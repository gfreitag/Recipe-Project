For the ragout: In a saute pan, heat the olive oil. Add the mushrooms
and shallots and saute for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, green onions
and garlic and continue sauteeing for 1-2 minutes. Season with salt
and pepper. Add the mushroom broth to the sauteed mixture and reduce
by half. Finish with the butter and reseason.

For the potato cakes: In a mixing bowl, combine the spinach, potatoes
and garlic together. Season with salt and pepper. Portion the mixture
into 2 ounce cakes. Dredge the cakes in the seasoned flour. Dip into
the beaten egg, letting any excess drip off. Coat each cake
completely with the seasoned bread crumbs. In a saute pan, heat the
olive oil. When the pan is smoking hot, add the cakes. Saute until
golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Flip the cakes over and continue
sauteeing until golden brown. Remove from pan and drain on a
paper-lined plate. Season with Essence. Spoon the ragout in the
center of the plate. Place the cakes in the center of the ragout.
