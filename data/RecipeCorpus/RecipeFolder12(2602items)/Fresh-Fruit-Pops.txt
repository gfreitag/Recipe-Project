Title: Fresh Fruit Pops
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 pt Blueberries, stemmed and
Rinsed
Honey
1    Container of Mascarpone
(about 10 ounces)
1/4    To 1/2 cup heavy cream
Using a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, puree the
blueberries until smooth.  Sweeten the blueberries with the honey to
taste. Add the cheese and puree until smooth.  With the machine
running add in enough cream to thin the filling to where it is
pourable. Fill each mold with the filling.  Cover the molds tightly
with plastic wrap and push the sticks into each mold.  Place the
molds in the freezer until frozen, about 2 to 3 hours.  Remove from
the freezer and discard the plastic wrap. If the molds will not come
out easily, place the molds in a little hot water.

Yield: 12 to 16 servings
