about 4-5 minutes. As they brown, transfer to a platter and set
aside. Using a metal spatula, remove any browned particles on the
bottom of the pot and discard. In the same pot, add the onions, bell
peppers and cook for 4-5 minutes. Add the carrots, garlic, and bay
leaves. Season with salt and cayenne. Stir and cook for 2-3 minutes.
Add the wine and simmer for about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato
paste, tomato sauce and water. Add the ribs and completely submerge
in the mixture. Stir in the herbs. Reduce the heat to medium and
simmer for about 2 1/2 hours, cover, or until the ribs are tender and
the meat is falling off the bones. Skim any fat that has risen to the
surface. On a platter, mound the potatoes in the center. Arrange the
ribs around the potatoes and drizzle with the gravy. Garnish with
green onions and Essence.
