8 1/2 oz Toor dal (oiled variety)
2 oz Tamarind

3/4 ts Tumeric powder
6    Green chilis, chopped

25    Curry leaves
8 tb Oil
8 1/2 oz Onions, sliced
6    Cloves
6    Green cardomoms
4    Inch cinnamon stick
2 ts Red chili powder
3 ts Garlic puree
3 ts Ginger puree
1 1/2 lb Mutton pieces
3    Tomatoes, chopped
6    Dried red chilis, broken
Into bits (optional)
3    Garlic cloves, sliced
1 ts Cumin seeds
1/4 ts Mustard seeds
1/3 ts Garam masala powder
Put lamb bones to boil in 5 cups water with cinnamon or bay leaf and
garlic clove for 30 minutes. Skim off the scum. Strain and set aside.

Wash both dals and soak them separately for 4 hours. Soak the
tamarind in 1 cup water for 1 hour, then press out the juice, strain
and set aside the tamarind water.

Put both dals into a cooking pot with 8 cups water and 1 teaspoon
salt, tumeric powder, 3 green chilis, 1 tablespoon coriander and 10
curry leaves. Cook for 1 1/2 hours or until tender. Liquidize to
creamy consistency.

Heat half the oil in another large cooking pot and saute onions for 5
to 7 minutes. Then add the

cloves, cardamoms and cinnamon, let cook 2 to 3 minutes, then add the
powdered garam masala. Add remaining green chilis, red chili powder,
the remaining coriander, 10 curry leaves, garlic puree and ginger
puree. Stir to prevent the spices from sticking to the pot. Sprinkle
over 2 tablespoons water if necessary.

Add the mutton and saute over a moderate heat for 5 minutes. Add
tomato and saute for 5 minutes. Stir in the pureed dals and the
stock, adding water to total 4 cups. Add salt to taste and leave to
cook, covered, over a moderate heat until the lamb is tender, about
45 to 50 minutes. Then add the tamarind water and remaining curry
leaves and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.

Just before serving, season by heating the remaining 4 tablespoons
oil in a small frying pan and fry red chilis, garlic, cumin seeds,
mustard seeds and garam masala powder (in this order). Fry 10
seconds, add to curry and stir. Serve.
