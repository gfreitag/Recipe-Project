Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Diced fresh rhubarb
2 1/4 c  Sugar, in all
4 tb Butter plus 4 teaspoons,
Divided
Juice of one lemon
1 ts Salt
1    Egg
1 tb Baking powder
1 c  Flour
1/4 ts Grated nutmeg
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1 tb Vanilla
1/2 c  Buttermilk
Vanilla bean ice cream
Fresh mint sprigs
Powdered sugar
Cinnamon sugar
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 2 quart casserole dish
with 2 teaspoons butter. In a saucepan, combine the rhubarb, 2 cups
sugar, 4 tablespoons of butter and lemon juice. Stir and cook until a
syrup begins to form and the rhubarb starts to soften, about 6 to 7
minutes. Remove from the heat. Using an electric mixer, cream the
remaining 2 teaspoons butter and sugar together. Add the egg. Slowly
add the baking powder, flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, and
buttermilk. Mix until thoroughly incorporated and the batter
resembles a cake batter. Pour the rhubarb into a greased 2 quart
casserole dish. Pour the batter over the rhubarb. Bake for 30 to 35
minutes or until the center is done. Spoon a heaping serving of the
cobbler onto a shallow bowl. Place one scoop of the ice cream to the
side. Garnish with fresh mint, powdered sugar, and cinnamon sugar.
