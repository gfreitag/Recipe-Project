Title: Ingrid's Spinach And Cheese Blintz
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Frozen spinach
3 tb Butter or extra virgin olive
Oil
2 c  Scallions, chopped
1 tb Sesame oil
1 c  Sharp cheddar cheese,
Grated
1 c  Mozzarella, grated
Salt and pepper
Completely defrost the spinach and squeeze out any excess liquid. Add
the butter or olive oil to a skillet and saute the scallions about 2
minutes. Add the spinach and continue to cook about 5 minutes longer.
Add the sesame oil, cheddar, and mozzarella, folding the spinach over
the cheese until it melts. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the
filling from the pan and cool before stuffing your blintz crepes.

If you refrigerate the mixture, it is best to bring the spinach to
room temperature, and drain again before stuffing or your blintzes
will be soggy.
