Title: Chanukah Jelly Doughnuts
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2    Scant tablespoons (2
Packages) active dry yeast
4 tb Sugar, plus sugar for
Rolling
3/4 c  Lukewarm water or milk
2 1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
Sifted
2 lg Egg yolks
pn Salt
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1 1/2 tb Unsalted butter or parve
Margarine, at room
Temperature
Vegetable oil for
Deep-frying
1/2 c  Plum, strawberry or apricot
Jam
Sprinkle the yeast and 2 tablespoons of the sugar into the water or
milk and stir to dissolve. Place the flour on a work surface and make
a well in the center. Add the yeast mixture, egg yolks, salt,
cinnamon, and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Knead well, about 5
minutes, working the butter or margarine into the dough and kneading
until the dough is elastic. You can also use a food processor fitted
with the steel blade to do this, processing about 2 minutes. Put the
dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic, and let it rise
overnight in the refrigerator.

Sprinkle flour on the work surface. Roll out the dough to an 1/8-inch
thickness. Using a 2-inch cookie cutter or floured drinking glass,
cut out circles. Let the dough circles rise 15 minutes more. With
your hands, gently form the dough circles into balls. Pour 2 inches
of oil into a heavy pot and heat until very hot, about 375 degrees.
Slip the doughnuts into the oil, 4 or 5 at a time, using a slotted
spoon. Turn them when brown, after a few minutes, to crisp on the
other side. Drain on paper towels.

Using a turkey baster or an injector available at cooking stores,
inject a teaspoon of jam into each doughnut. Then roll all of them in
granulated sugar and serve immediately. You can make larger doughnuts
if you like.
