Title: Souffleed Potato Gnocchi
Categories: Live
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Milk
3/4    Stick unsalted butter
1/4 c  All-purpose flour
3 lg Eggs
1 lb Round white potatoes,
Scrubbed
1/4 c  Minced fresh parsley leaves
1/4 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
In a small heavy saucepan combine the milk and 1/2 stick of the
butter, bring the milk to a boil, and add the flour, whisking until
the mixture cleans the sides of the pan.  Cook the mixture over
moderately low heat, whisking, for 1 minute and remove the pan from
the heat. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each
addition, and keep the mixture warm, covered. In a saucepan cover the
potatoes with 2 inches salted water, bring the water to a boil, and
simmer the potatoes, covered, for 30 to 40 minutes, or until they are
tender.  Drain the potatoes, let them cool until they can be handled,
and peel them.  Force the potatoes through a ricer or food mill into
a bowl, add the egg mixture, and with an electric mixer beat the
mixture well.  Stir in the parsley and salt and pepper and transfer
the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a large tip. Pipe mounds of
the mixture into a buttered 1 1/2 quart gratin dish, sprinkle the top
with the Parmesan, and dot it with the remaining 2 tablespoons
butter. Bake the gnocchi in a preheated 400 degree oven for 30 to 35
minutes, or until it is puffed and golden.
