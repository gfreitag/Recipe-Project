Clean crabs by rinsing in cold water as you remove the gills, apron,
and mouth. Season crabs with salt and pepper. In a saute pan over
medium heat, heat oil and 1 tablespoon of butter.

Add the crabs to the hot pan, back side down and saute over medium
heat. Turn them with a spatula to cook the other side when they are
crisp and browned.

When they are completely cooked, about 3 minutes each side, remove to
a warm platter. Add the capers and remaining butter to the pan and
brown 1 minute. Add the lemon juice and parsley to the hot pan and
pour over the crabs on the platter or on individual plates. Serve on
a bed of smashed new potatoes with lots of fresh chopped parsley and
olive oil.
