Title: Hot Milk Sponge Sheet
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Milk
2 tb Sweet butter, cut into small
Pieces
3/4 c  Sifted cake flour
1 ts Baking powder
3/4 c  Sugar
3    Egg yolks, room temperature
Equipment:
12 x  16-inch or 11 x 17-inch
Jelly roll or half sheet
Pan
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line bottom of pan with waxed or
parchment paper so that the paper overhangs the pan at two opposite
ends.

Heat milk with butter in small saucepan over medium heat until butter
melts.  Reduce heat to low and keep hot but do not simmer.

Sift flour with baking powder twice.  Return to sifter and set aside.
In a large heatproof bowl, use a hand-held whisk to combine sugar,
eggs and yolks.  Set bowl over or in a pan of barely simmering water.
Warm the mixture, whisking occasionally, until it is lukewarm to the
touch. (Alternatively, omit the water bath and hold the bowl directly
over the stove burner, whisking vigorously for about a minute until
the eggs are warm.  This is the quickest, easiest method but you must
whisk the eggs continuously to keep them from starting to scramble).

Transfer bowl to electric mixer; beat at high speed until mixture has
cooled, tripled in volume and has the consistency of thick whipped
cream.

Sift one-third of flour mixture over batter and fold it gently, by
hand, using the largest rubber spatula you have.  Fold in half the
remaining flour; then fold in the remaining flour.

Pour hot milk and butter into batter and fold well, scraping the
bottom each time and bringing the batter up the sides of the bowl
until you can no longer see traces of liquid.  Transfer batter into
prepared pan and spread evenly.  Bake until cake is browned, starts
to shrink from the sides of pan, and springs back when lightly
pressed: about 10 minutes. Cool cake in pan, on a rack.  When cake is
cool, run a small knife or spatula around the edges to release before
unmolding. Cool completely before filling.
