Title: Lamb Rillette
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Lamb, stew meat
1 qt Lamb oil (lamb deckle fat
Rendered down with pomace
Oil)
3    Cloves of garlic
3    Sprigs of fresh rosemary
Salt and black pepper
1/4    To 1/2 cup duck fat
1 c  Minced shallots
1 ts Minced garlic
1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1 tb Finely chopped rosemary
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Season the meat with salt and pepper.
Place the meat in an oven proof pan and cover with the lamb fat. Add
the garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs to the pan and season with salt
and pepper. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and place in the oven.
Slow cook the meat for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until the meat is
very tender. Remove from the oven and strain. Reserve the lamb fat
for future use. Discard the rosemary. Place the meat in a mixing
bowl, and using two forks begin to separate the meat into strands.
This is called pulling the meat. Stir 1/4 cup of the duck fat. Stir
in the shallots, garlic, rosemary and parsley. Season the lamb with
salt and black pepper. If the rillette is not moist enough, add the
remaining duck fat. Cover the rillette and store in the refrigerator.
The rillette will keep for up to 2 weeks.

Yield: about 3/4 pounds
