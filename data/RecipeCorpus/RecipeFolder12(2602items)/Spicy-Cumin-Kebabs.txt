Title: Spicy Cumin Kebabs
Categories: Lamb
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Boneless lamb leg
1 tb Cumin
1 ts Cayenne
1 ts Black peppercorns
1 ts Salt, or more to taste
You will need a charcoal or gas grill, 12 to 15 small bamboo or metal
skewers, and a spice grinder or mortar and pestle.

Preheat grill.  If using bamboo skewers, soak in water for 30 minutes.
Remove excess fat from the meat.  Cut lamb into small chunks, 1/2-inch
across or less.  Thread them onto skewers, without packing them too
tightly together.

Grind or pound together the cumin, cayenne, and black pepper to a
blended powder.  Using your hands, rub spice mixture onto the
skewered meat. Grill lamb for 5 to 8 minutes over hot coals. Halfway
through the cooking, sprinkle the kebabs with a little salt.
