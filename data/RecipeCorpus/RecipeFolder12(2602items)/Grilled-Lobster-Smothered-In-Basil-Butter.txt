Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Unsalted butter,
1/2 c  Basil chiffonade
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper to taste
4    (2 1/2 pound) whole
Lobsters
2 tb Olive oil
Combine the butter, basil, and salt and pepper to taste in a food
processor and blend until smooth. Pack the mixture into a medium
ramekin, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30
minutes. Split the lobsters in half lengthwise. Bring the knife down
through the tail, making sure to cut just through the meat and to
leave the shell connected. Lay the lobster open, leaving the two
halves slightly attached. Pull off claws and legs from the lobsters
and crack them slightly with the knife handle. Place the claws and
legs on the grill over medium - low heat and cover with a pie pan.
Cook them for 5 to 7 minutes per side. Brush the lobster bodies with
the oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Place them
flesh-side down on the grill over medium heat. Grill 8 to 10 minutes

Remove the lobsters and slather with the basil butter.
