Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 qt Water or chicken stock, beef
Or vegetable broth
2 ts Dry thyme
3    Or 4 yellow onions
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 ts Salt
1 c  Dry white wine
Freshly ground black pepper
To taste
1 c  Grated Swiss cheese,
Parmesan, or Blue cheese and
Swiss
2 lg Slices of bread, cut in
Triangles or 8 small rounds
1 tb Cognac, 2 eggs yolks and 2
TB sherry or port
(optional) stirred in a bowl
Ready to add to the soup
Bring the water and thyme to a boil. Trim, peel slice the onions
(under water to avoid tears or in a food processor).

Heat butter and oil in a skillet and cook the onions for 5 minutes,
don't let them get too brown. Sprinkle with salt, cover for 5 minutes
stirring once. Add a cup of dry white wine to the onions then pour
the whole thing into the pan of hot water and simmer partly covered,
lid halfway for 35 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and a drop of
Cognac if you like.

Toast the slices of bread on one side lightly, turn on the other side
then sprinkle with grated cheese.

Pour the soup into a oven- proof tureen, or individual tureens, top
with the bread and cheese and bake for 20 to 30 minutes. Lift the
crust of bread and cheese once or twice (it is supposed to be lifted
and pushed down... 7 times!!) with a fork and add the Cognac- sherry
and egg yolk mixture. Leave in oven for another minute then serve
piping hot wrapped in a thick towel and you wearing thick oven
mittens and a brave smile.

Serve with a dry white wine.

Yield: 4 - 6 servings
