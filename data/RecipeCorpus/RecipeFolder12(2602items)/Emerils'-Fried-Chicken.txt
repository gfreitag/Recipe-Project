Yield: 8 servings
2 c  Buttermilk
4 tb Creole seasoning
1    3-pound chicken cut in 8
Pieces
Vegetable oil, for
Deep-frying
2 c  Flour
In a large shallow bowl combine buttermilk and seasoning and add
chicken, turning pieces until they are completely covered; marinate
chicken 1 to 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large cast-iron skillet or
chicken-fryer heat 1 to 2 inches of oil over medium-high heat to 350
degrees F. Drain chicken, wiping off excess liquid, and thoroughly
dredge in flour.  Fry chicken until golden, turning once, about 10
minutes in all. Transfer pan to oven and cook until browned, turning
once or twice, 20 to 30 minutes longer.  Drain chicken pieces briefly
on paper towels to absorb any excess oil before serving.
