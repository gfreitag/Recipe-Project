1 lb Assorted sliced mushrooms
(such as Cremini,

And Button)
4 tb Oil, divided
Creole spice
6 oz Angel hair pasta
2 oz Diced Tasso
2 tb Minced shallots
1 tb Chopped scallions plus extra
For garnish
1/2 tb Minced garlic
3 oz Heavy cream
1 tb Butter
2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese, and
Green onion for garnish
Preheat grill until very hot; toss in a handful of soaked hickory
chips. When grill begins to smoke, in a large bowl toss mushrooms
with 3 tablespoons oil and 1 tablespoon Creole spice or to taste;
transfer to a wire grilling basket. Place basket on grill and stir
mushrooms with a long pair of tongs for smoky flavor to penetrate
evenly. Pour mushrooms onto a baking sheet to cool.

In a large pot of boiling water cook pasta until just tender; drain
and keep warm. Meanwhile, heat remaining oil in a saute pan, add
Tasso and saute, shaking pan frequently, 2 minutes. Add shallots,
green onions and smoked mushrooms, and cook, tossing 2 minutes. Add
garlic and cream, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer to reduce
slightly. Reheat pasta if necessary and divide between 2 warmed
plates. To finish sauce, stir in butter, adjust seasonings with
Creole spice and spoon over pasta. Garnish with green onions and
Parmesan.
