Title: Roasted Fillet of Beef Stuffed with Duck Rillette
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
5 lb Beef tenderloin, trimmed and
Butterflied
2 lb Duck rillette
Salt and black pepper
Butchers twine
2 tb Olive oil
1/4 c  Creole Mustard
1 c  Cracked black pepper
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Season the entire tenderloin with
salt and pepper. Spread the duck rillette over the inside of the
tenderloin, leaving about 1/2-inch around the edges. Gently roll the
tenderloin up, like a jelly roll. Using butchers twine, make several
knots, about 2 inches apart. This will secure the stuffing and aid in
overall cooking. In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil. Sear the
tenderloin for 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the pan and set
aide. After the fillet has cooled, rub the entire tenderloin with the
mustard. Roll the entire tenderloin in the cracked black pepper,
crusting the entire tenderloin. Line a baking sheet pan with
parchment paper. Lay the tenderloin on the pan and roast for about 30
to 35 minutes for medium rare. Remove from the oven and rest for 5
minutes before slicing. With a carving knife, slice the tenderloin
into fillets, about 2 inches thick. Yield: 8 to 10 servings
