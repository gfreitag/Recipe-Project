1/2 c  Unsalted butter, softened
1/2 c  Sugar, powdered
1 1/2 tb Grated lemon zest
3/4 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 tb Poppy seeds
1 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
Sugar, powdered
In a bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter with confectioners'
sugar and beat the mixture until it is light and fluffy. Beat in the
zest and the vanilla, add the poppy seeds, the flour, and the salt,
and beat the mixture until it is just combined. Press the mixture
evenly into a buttered 8-inch square baking pan and bake it in the
middle of a preheated 300 degree oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until
it is pale golden. Let the shortbread cool in the pan on a rack for
10 minutes, cut it into 24 bars, and let the bars cool completely in
the pan. Sprinkle the bars with the additional confectioners' sugar.
