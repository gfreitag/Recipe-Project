Title: Meringue Mushrooms
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
4 lg Egg whites (1/2 cup)
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
1 c  Sugar (preferably
Superfine)
About 2 teaspoons
Unsweetened cocoa
2 oz Bittersweet or semisweet
Chocolate, cut into small
Pieces
Cookie sheet lined with
Parchment paper
Pastry bag fitted with plain
1/2    -inch tip
In a large heatproof bowl, whisk the egg whites, cream of tartar, and
sugar together until all of the sugar is moistened. Whisking
constantly, set the bowl on direct heat or in a pan of simmering
water, until the egg whites are warm to the touch. Remove from the
heat and beat at high speed until mixture is very stiff and dull
looking.

Scrape meringue mixture into pastry bag. Pipe round, button shapes to
make mushroom "caps". Pipe pointed "kiss" shapes about one inch tall
to make "stems". Dust with cocoa. Bake two hours in a 200 degree oven
until crisp and completely dry.

Assemble the mushrooms: Place chocolate in a small bowl. Set bowl in a
skillet of barely simmering water. Immediately turn off heat and stir
chocolate until melted and smooth.

Spread a little melted chocolate on the flat side of each meringue
mushroom "cap". Use a sharp knife to cut off and discard the pointed
ends of meringue "stems". Attach stems to caps while chocolate is
still soft. Set assembles mushrooms aside until the chocolate has
dried and caps and stems are "glued" together. (Meringue mushrooms
may be made 3 to 4 weeks in advance and stored in an airtight
container.)

Yield: about 65 mushrooms with 1 1/2-inch caps
