Title: Clarissa's Clam Chowder
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 pt Fresh clams
8 oz Speck di proscuitto or other
Interesting bacon, cut into
Small
Pieces
3 sm Onions, finely diced
1 1/2 pt Boiling water
1 1/2 lb Potatoes, peeled and diced
Black pepper, freshly
Ground
1 1/2 pt Milk
Shuck clams or steam them open using a little white wine. Keep all the
liquor from the shells.

In a heavy frying pan slowly fry the bacon and onions until golden;
transfer to a saucepan.  Add the boiling water, potatoes and pepper
and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Add
the clams, with their liquor, and the milk.  Bring to the boil and
cook for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat and allow to sit for 1
hour. Just before serving, reheat the chowder.  Ladle into bowls over
crumbled crackers. You can get rid of alot of anger by putting your
packets of crackers in a plastic bag and throwing them on the floor
repeatedly, until they reach the required state of crumb. Or stamp on
them, says my friend Claire Macdonald.
