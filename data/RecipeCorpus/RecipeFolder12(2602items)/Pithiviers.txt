1/2 lb Butter
1/2 lb Sugar
1/2 lb Almonds, finely ground
2    Eggs
1    Egg, for wash
1 tb Water
1/4 c  Slivered almonds
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Cut two 11-inch disks out of puff pastry and place one in the center
of a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper. With a fork, poke
holes in one round of pastry. For almond cream: In a standing
electric mixer, cream butter and sugar until light. Add eggs one at a

Spoon almond cream over the pastry. Lay second disk of puff pastry
over and seal edges with a fork to form a pillow. Cut spokes into the
pillow to form a crown. Mix water and egg to form wash and brush over
entire surface. Sprinkle with slivered almonds and bake 35 to 45
minutes, until firm and golden brown. Allow to cool and serve.
