Categories: Monday
Yield: 4 servings
Butter and flour for loaf
Pans
1 1/2    Sticks softened unsalted
Butter, at room temperature
1 2/3 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Almond paste
5    Egg yolks
1 ts Vanilla
12 lg Egg whites
pn Salt
3 c  Sifted flour
3 oz Semi-sweet chocolate,
Melted
Butter and flour 2 (9 x 5 x 3-inch) loaf pans and set aside. Preheat
the oven to 350 degrees.

With an electric mixer cream the butter with 1/4 cup of the sugar and
beat until it looks light and fluffy.  Add the almond paste a bit at
a time and continue to beat until the mixture looks light and fluffy.
Add the yolks, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, then
beat in the vanilla.

Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form.  Add
the remaining sugar, a tablespoonful at a time, until the egg whites
are stiff but not dry.  Fold one quarter of the beaten whites into
the butter/almond paste mixture, then fold that lightened mixture
back into the remaining egg whites, sprinkling and adding in flour as
you fold. Add melted chocolate, cutting through the batter with
rubber spatula to marble the batter. Pour the batter into the
prepared loaf pans and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until a cake
tester comes out clean when inserted in the middle of the cake; the
cakes should be golden brown and pull away from sides of the pan. Let
them set in the loaf pans for 15 minutes.  Run a sharp knife around
the edges and loosen the cakes onto a rack to cool completely.
