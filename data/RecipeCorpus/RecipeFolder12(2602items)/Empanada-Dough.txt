Title: Empanada Dough
Categories: Emeril, Mexican
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Masa harina (available in
Mexican or Latin American
Markets)
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Southwest seasoning
1/2 ts Salt
Black pepper
2 tb Solid vegetable shortening
1 1/2 c  Filling of your choice (such
As crab or spicy beef)
1    Egg beaten with 2
TB water, for egg wash
Combine masa harina, flour, cornmeal, baking powder, Southwest
seasoning, salt and 3 turns pepper in a medium bowl and mix
thoroughly. Cream in shortening with a fork until mixture resembles
coarse crumbs. Add about 1 cup water, a little at a time, working
dough until all water is completely incorporated. Use just enough
water to make dough come together. Turn dough out onto a lightly
floured surface and pat into a 12- by 3-inch log. Refrigerate until
firm, about 20 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove dough from refrigerator and
divide log into 4 equal sections, each about 3 inches long. Carefully
roll out each section between sheets of plastic wrap to an 8-inch
circle, about 1/4-inch thick. Handle dough with care to keep from
cracking. Brush top sides of rounds with egg wash. Mound filling in
center of each round and fold dough to form a half-moon shape. Crimp
edges with a fork and brush with remaining egg wash. Transfer
empanadas to a parchment or wax-paper-lined baking sheet and bake
35    minutes until golden.
