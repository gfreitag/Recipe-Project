Title: Perfect English Tea
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
Irish breakfast tea leaves
Milk
Sugar cubes
Lemon slices
Honey
Fill a kettle with cold water and set it to boil.  As the water nears
a boil, pour a little of it into a teapot to warm it, swirling the
water around and then discarding it.  For each cup of tea desired,
place a spoonful of loose tea leaves into the empty, warmed teapot.
Pour the boiling water into the teapot and let the tea steep 3 to 6
minutes, depending on the type of tea leaves.  Gently stir the tea
before pouring it through strainers into teacups. Serve with milk and
sugar cubes, or lemon slices and honey.
