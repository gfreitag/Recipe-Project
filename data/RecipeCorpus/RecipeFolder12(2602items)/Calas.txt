Title: Calas
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Water
1/2 c  Long grain white rice
1 pk Yeast ( 1/4-ounce)
1/2 c  Warm water
3    Eggs
1/2 c  Sugar
3 tb Flour
1/2 ts Grated fresh nutmeg
Vegetable oil for frying
Powdered sugar in shaker
Bring the water up to a boil and add the rice. Cook the rice until
very soft and mushy, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the rice and let
the rice cool completely. When the rice has cooled, mash the rice
well. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Add the yeast to the
mashed rice and mix well. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let
the mixture sit overnight to rise. The next morning, whisk the eggs
together. Add the eggs to the rice mixture. Add the sugar and flour
to the rice mixture and mix well to form a thick batter. Let the
mixture sit for 15 minutes. Preheat the oil in a stock pot. Drop a
heaping spoonful of the batter into the hot oil. Fry in batches. Fry
the calas until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the calas
from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Repeat the process
until all the calas are fried. Sprinkle the calas with powdered sugar
and serve immediately.

Yield: about 6 calas
