Title: Corn Pancakes
Categories: Toohot
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Finely ground cornmeal,
Preferably organic
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Coarse salt
1 tb Sugar
1/4 c  (1/2 stick) unsalted butter,
Cut into small pieces
2 c  Buttermilk
1/4    1/2 cup milk
Butter or oil for coating
Pan
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.  In a bowl, combine the cornmeal,
flour, baking soda, salt, sugar and butter.  Blend together with your
fingertips or a pastry blender until the consistency of a coarse
meal. Pour in the buttermilk and stir just until the dry ingredients
are evenly moistened. Add just enough milk to form a thin pancake
batter, stirring gently to combine.  Heat the griddle or large
cast-iron skillet over medium heat and lightly coat with butter or
oil. Ladle on about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake and cook until
bubbles form on the surface of each pancake and the bottom is golden
brown.  Flip and cook on the second side until golden, about 1
minute.  Transfer to a paper towel lined baking sheet and keep warm
in the oven while you cook the rest of the pancakes. Served hot,
topped with Maple Fruit Compote.

Yield: 12 large pancakes, serves 46
