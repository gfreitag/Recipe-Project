Title: Big Cut Broccoli With Arbol Chilies
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 lb Broccoli
1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Water
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Butter
8    Cloves garlic, cut
Lengthwise into thin slices
4    Whole arbol chilies
1/4 ts Fresh-ground black pepper
1 tb Grated Parmesan cheese, plus
More for serving
Cut the broccoli stalks into branches and cut each branch in half.
Peel the stems. Put the broccoli in two large, deep frying pans. Or
cook the broccoli in two batches. In each pan, sprinkle 1/8 teaspoon
of salt and add 1 cup of the water. Cover and bring to a boil over
moderately high heat. Let cook for 1 minute. Uncover the pans and
cook until all the water evaporates, about 14 minutes.

As soon as the water evaporates, add 2 tablespoons of the oil to each
pan. When the broccoli begins to sizzle, add 1 tablespoon of the
butter and half the garlic to each pan. Cook just until the garlic is
light brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the broccoli over and reduce the
heat to moderate so that the garlic doesn't burn. To each pan add
half the chilies, 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Cook
until the broccoli is browned and tender, 1 to 2 minutes longer.

Transfer all the broccoli to a plate, sprinkle with the Parmesan and
serve with extra cheese.
