Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM------------------TOO HOT TAMALES #TH6297-----------------------
4    6-ounce firm fleshed fish
Fillets, such as salmon,
Bass, or snapper, skin
Removed
1 ts Oil or butter
2 c  Court bouillon, strained
Run fingers over fish fillets to feel for tiny bones; if there are
any, remove with needlenose pliers or tweezers. Lightly oil or butter
the bottom of a deep skillet big enough to fit fish fillets in a
single layer and place fish thus in skillet. Bring court bouillon to
a simmer. Gently pour court bouillon over the fish, covering
completely. Turn heat on very low so that liquid steams but does not
quite simmer for 2 minutes. Turn off heat and let fish sit in liquid
an additional 5 minutes per inch of thickness. Start checking fish
for doneness: a thin knife inserted in thickest part of fillet should
meet with just slight resistance. Fish should still be slightly
translucent in center. Remove fish from skillet with slotted spatula,
blot the bottom lightly with a paper towel, and serve.

Poaching is a delicious way to prepare fish without adding fat. Great
for dinner parties: because the cooking is gentle, it allows a wide
margin of error, fish won't overcook too quickly.

Properly poached fish has a wonderful silky texture.
