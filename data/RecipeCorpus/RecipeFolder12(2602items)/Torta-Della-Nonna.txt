MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
2 c  Flour
1    Egg
2    Yolks
1/2 c  Sugar
3 tb Sweet butter and
3 tb Olive oil melted together
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 c  Fresh ricotta (sheep's milk
Is best)
1/2 c  Pine nuts
1/2 c  Sugar
1    Lemons; Juice and zest of
3    Eggs
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

To make the pastry, make a well of the flour, place egg, yolks, sugar,
butter and olive oil mixture in center and proceed as you would with
fresh pasta, i.e. bring flour in bit by bit until liquid in well is
thick enough to bring together with hands. Knead until dough is
smooth and then allow to rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling
by mixing together the ricotta, pine nuts, sugar, lemon zest, juice
and eggs in a bowl until creamy. To assemble, roll out the pastry to
form two 12 inch circles. Place one circle down to line the bottom
and sides of the pan. Spread the ricotta mixture evenly over this
layer. Place the remaining circle of dough over the top and pinch
together the edges. Place in oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes.
Remove and serve warm or at room temperature with vin santo from
Cappezzana.
