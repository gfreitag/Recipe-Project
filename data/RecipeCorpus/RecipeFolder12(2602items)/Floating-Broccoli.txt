Title: Floating Broccoli
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Bunch broccoli
4 tb Butter
2 tb Heavy cream
Salt and pepper
Trim 3 inches from bottom of broccoli stalks and discard. Separate
the tiny flower heads from remaining stalks, (you are going to cook
the stalks and florets separately) making sure you break the florets
into little pieces. Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil with 1
tablespoon of salt. Drop the broccoli stalks into the boiling water
and cook them for about 15 minutes or until tender. Drain well.
Meanwhile, steam florets over water for 3 to 4 minutes or until
tender but still bright green; remove them from the heat, and keep
warm off heat until serving time.

In a food processor puree cooked stalks with butter, cream, salt and
pepper to taste. Pat the steamed florets dry, fold half of them into
the broccoli puree and spoon it into a serving bowl. "Float"
remaining steamed florets on top of puree, flower side up.
