Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Ground chocolate wafers
1/2    Stick butter, melted
3 lb Cream cheese, cubed and room
Temperature
3 c  Sugar
6    Eggs
1 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Flour
pn Salt
2 ts Pure vanilla extract
1 c  Brown sugar
2 tb Light corn syrup
2 tb Butter

1/2 c  Sweetened condensed milk
1 1/2 c  Pecan pieces
2 c  Sweetened whipped cream
Sprigs of fresh mint
In a mixing bowl, combine the ground wafers and melted butter,
together. Mix well. Press the crust on the bottom of a 10-inch
spring-form pan. In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, puree
the cream cheese until smooth. Add 2 cups of sugar and process until
incorporated. With the machine running, add the eggs, one at a time.
Add the cream, flour, salt and 1 teaspoon vanilla, mix well. Using a
rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the processor. Process until
the batter is smooth. Pour the batter over the crust. Bake for 1 hour
and 15 minutes or until the center is firm. Remove from the oven and
run a knife around the sides of the pan. Cool on a wire rack. Serve
either at room temperature or chilled. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan,
combine the remaining sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, butter, pinch
of salt, and condensed milk. With a wooden spoon, stir until the
sugar dissolves. Continue to cook, stirring, until smooth and light
brown, about 8 minutes. Add the remaining vanilla and pecan pieces
and continue to cook, stirring, until the mixture reaches 234 to 240
degrees F on a candy thermometer or the soft ball stage. Remove from
the heat and pour over the cheesecake. Let sauce cool and then slice
into individual servings.

Garnish each slice with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprig of mint.
