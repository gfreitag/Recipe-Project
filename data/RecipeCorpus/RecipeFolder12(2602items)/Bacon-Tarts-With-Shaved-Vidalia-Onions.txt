1 lb Bacon, small diced
1 qt Heavy cream
1    Head of garlic
7    Egg yolks
1 c  Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a saute pan, render the bacon
until crispy, about 3-4 minutes. Remove from the fat and drain on a
paper-lined plate (reserve the fat). In a sauce pot, bring the cream
and split head of garlic up to a simmer. Simmer the cream for 4-5
minutes to infuse the cream. Remove from the heat and discard the
garlic. In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs until frothy. Slowly temper
the cream into the yolks, whisking constantly. Fold in the bacon and
cheese. Season with Crystal, Worcestershire, salt and white pepper.
Pour the filling into the pie shell. Place the pan on a baking sheet.
Bake for 45 minutes to an hour or until the pie sets. Let the pie
cool for 8-10 minutes. Slice the pie into 12 pieces. Using a
mandoline, shave the onion, paper-thin. Place the shaved onions on
top of the tart. Place a slice of the tart on a plate. Garnish with
parsley and Essence.
