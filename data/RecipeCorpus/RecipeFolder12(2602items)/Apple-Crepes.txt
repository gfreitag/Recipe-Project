Title: Apple Crepes
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1    Stick butter
1 c  Brown sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Fresh grated nutmeg
1 c  Walnut pieces
3    Granny Smith apples, cored
And sliced 1/4-inch thick
1/4    To 1/2 cup Apple Jack Brandy
Or any other apple liquor or
Brandy
8    Scoops Cinnamon ice cream
8    Crepes
2 oz Crumbled Maytag Blue cheese
In a saute pan, melt the butter.  Stir in the brown sugar, cinnamon,
and nutmeg.  Cook the mixture for 1 minute to dissolve the sugar. Add
the walnuts and apples.  Cook the apples for 3 to 4 minutes, or until
the apples are tender and caramelized.  Remove the pan from the heat
and add the brandy.  Place the pan back on the stove. Shake the pan a
couple of times to ignite the flame.  If the flame does not ignite,
carefully light the flame with a match.  Spread a scoop of the ice
cream evenly over each crepe.  Starting with one side, gently roll
the crepe up like a jellyroll. Place the crepes in the freezer and
freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Divide the crepes between four
shallow bowls. Spoon the apple/walnut mixture over the crepes.
Sprinkle the cheese over the top and serve immediately.
