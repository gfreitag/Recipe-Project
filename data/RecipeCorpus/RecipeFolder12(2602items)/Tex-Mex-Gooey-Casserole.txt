diced meat and continue to cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic,
chili powder, and cumin. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the
tomato paste. Stir in the tomatoes and stock. Simmer the mixture for

Spoon a couple of tablespoons of the chili mixture on the bottom of
the prepared pan. Lay two tortillas on top of the chili mixture.
Sprinkle the top of the tortillas with the Cheddar and Jack cheese.
Repeat the layering process until all of the chili, tortillas and
cheese are used. (The final layer should be cheese) Place the pan in
the oven and bake until the cheese has melted, about 10 to 12
minutes. Remove from the oven and cool slightly before slicing.
