Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1    Envelope (1/4-ounce) active
Dry yeast
1 tb Sugar
1 c  Warm water (about 110
Degrees F.)
1 ts Salt
3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Olive oil
3 tb Kosher salt
2 tb Coarse black pepper
11 oz Fresh ricotta cheese, at
Room temperature
2 lg Eggs
4 oz Salami, julienned
6 oz Mozzarella cheese, grated
And at room temperature
1/3 c  Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
Cheese
1 tb Minced garlic
1 tb Finely chopped parsley
Salt and pepper
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using an electric mixer with a
dough hook, whisk the yeast, sugar, and warm water together, for 2
minutes to dissolve the yeast. Add the flour and salt. With the mixer
on low, mix until the dough starts to come together. Increase the
speed to medium-high and mix until the dough comes away from the
sides of the bowl and crawls up to dough hook. Grease a mixing bowl
with the vegetable oil. Place the dough in the greased bowl and turn
once. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft
free place until the dough doubles in size about 1 1/2 hours. Turn
the dough out onto a baking sheet. Punch the dough down and press the
dough out to form the pan. Sprinkle the dough with kosher salt and
coarse black pepper. Cover the dough and allow to double in size,
about 45 minutes. In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, eggs,
salami, Mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, garlic and parsley. Mix
well and season with salt and pepper. Using your fingers make small
dimples over the entire dough. Brush the dough with olive oil. Smear
the filling evenly over the dough. **The filling must be at room
temperature to smear evenly. Bake the dough for 30 to 35 minutes or
until the dough is golden brown. Slice the bread into 8 to 12 pieces.
