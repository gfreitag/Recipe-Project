Title: Milk Chocolate Cheesecake
Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Oreo cookie crumbs
1 c  Butter cookie crumbs
1/2 c  Melted unsalted butter
3 lb Cream cheese, softened
2 c  Sugar, in all
6    Eggs
1 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Melted milk chocolate
2 c  Fresh raspberries
Juice of one lemon
1/4 c  Grand Marnier
Whipped cream in a pastry
Bag with star tip
Fresh mint sprigs
Chocolate curls
Powdered sugar in shaker
Cocoa powder in shaker
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Combine the crumbs and the butter
together.  Mix well and press into a 10-inch springform pan.  In a
food processor, with the metal blade, mix the cream cheese until
smooth. Add the sugar and blend.  Add the eggs one at a time to
thoroughly incorporate into the cheese mixture.  Add the heavy cream.
Add the flour, salt and vanilla and blend until smooth.  In a steady
stream, pour in the melted chocolate. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the cake is set. Remove from
the oven and with a knife loosen the sides from the pan.  This will
prevent the cake from splitting down the center. Completely cool the
cake before cutting.  For the sauce:  In a mixing bowl, combine all
the ingredients together and allow to sit for 2-3 hours. Place a
piece of the cake on the plate.  Spoon the raspberries over the top.
Garnish with whipped cream, chocolate curls, mint sprigs, powdered
sugar, and cocoa powder.
