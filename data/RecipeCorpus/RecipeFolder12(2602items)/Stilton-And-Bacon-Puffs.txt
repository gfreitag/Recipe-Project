1/2 c  Water
1/2    Stick (1/4 cup) unsalted
Butter, cut into bits
1 pn Salt
1/2 c  Flour
2 lg Eggs
1/4 lb Stilton, crumbled (about 1
Cup)
4 sl Bacon, cooked crisp and
Crumbled fine
1/4 c  Minced scallion
In a small heavy saucepan combine the water, the butter, and a pinch
of salt and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Reduce the
heat to moderate, add the flour all at once, and with a wooden spoon
beat the mixture until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and
forms a ball. Remove the pan from the heat, add the eggs, 1 at a
time, beating well after each addition, and stir in the Stilton, the
bacon, the scallion, and salt and pepper to taste. Drop rounded
teaspoons of the batter 2 inches apart onto lightly buttered baking
sheets and bake the puffs in the middle of a preheated 425 degree
oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are crisp and golden.
