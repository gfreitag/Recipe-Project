Categories: Emeril
Yield: 4 servings
Bread crumbs for coating
Ramekins
2 oz Maytag Blue cheese
4    Eggs, separated
1 tb Finely ground walnuts
4    Ounces, fresh white bread,
Cut in 1/2-inch cubes
Salt and pepper
Garnish:
Walnuts
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Chiffonade of mint
Cracked black pepper
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Butter the interior of 4 ramekins and
lightly coat the entire surface with the bread crumbs, making sure
the crumbs adhere to the rim. In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks,
cheese, and walnuts to combine.

Fold in the bread cubes: coat thoroughly. Allow to sit for 5 minutes.
Whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Using your whisk, fold in
1/2 of the egg whites, mix to incorporate.

Season highly. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the remaining egg
white. Divide the mixture between the 4 prepared ramekins. Make sure
to fill them up all the way, but do not touch the rims with any of
the mixture. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet, and carefully
place in the center of the oven. Bake for 15 minutes.

While the souffles are baking, decorate your plates with walnuts,
drizzle of oil, mint, and a sprinkle of pepper. Remove the souffles
from the oven and serve immediately.
