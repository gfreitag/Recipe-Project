reserve the bits for later. In remaining fat in skillet (add some oil
if not enough) add onions and saute for 5 minutes or until tender.
Add garlic and mushrooms and continue to saute a couple of minutes or
until cooked through. Remove the skillet from the heat and strain out
any excess fat and liquid by pouring contents through a sieve; add
bacon bits to onions and mushrooms in a mixing bowl. Stir in leftover
pot roast and peas and set aside. In a small saucepan, heat 3
tablespoons of butter and add the flour. Cook for a minutes to make a
roux. Add broth and whisk vigorously . Bring to a simmer and cook for
a few minutes or until thickened. Add dill weed and pickle and adjust
the seasoning.

Preheat oven to 475 degrees. Pour sauce over the beef, peas, etc. and
season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour the mixture in a
quartsize, 2 inch deep round baking dish. Roll out pastry and set
over the pie. Tuck excess dough under the rim and crimp the edges
decoratively if you wish. Cut a couple of slits in the crust to allow
steam to escape. Set pie on a baking sheet and set in middle of oven.
Bake at high heat for 15 minutes. Lower heat to 375 degrees and bake
for 15 minutes more or until crust is golden and the filling is hot.
