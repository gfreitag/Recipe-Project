Title: GRILLED STEAKS W/GARLIC CRUMBS
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Sirloin Steak
2 1/2 tb Dijon Mustard
1 1/2 tb Dry White Wine
1 ts Black Pepper, Ground
2 tb Butter
1 c  Garlic, Pressed
1 c  Bread Crumbs
1/4 c  Parsley, Minced
Preheat the barbecue grill - it is ready when all the coals have an
even coat of gray ash. The steak should be at least 1 1/2" thick. Pat
the steak dry with paper towels. Mix the mustard, wine and pepper.
Spread the mixture on both sides of the steak, using about 2/3 of the
mixture. Grill the steaks 5 or 6 inches from the coals, turning once,
until medium rare (about 25 minutes total). While the steaks are
cooking, heat the butter and garlic together in a heavy skillet and
cook for 10 minutes. Add the bread crumbs. Cook over medium-low heat,
stirring, until the crumbs are toasted. Brush the top of the cooked
steak with the remaining mustard mixture. Press the toasted crumbs
onto the top and sides of the steak. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve
sliced into 1/2" thick strips.
