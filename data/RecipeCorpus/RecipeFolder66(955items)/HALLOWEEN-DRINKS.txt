Okay, first the drinks. Easiest is to mix something yellow with
something blue.  Orange juice and Mountain Dew are good for the
yellow, Great Bluedini kool-aid is good for the blue. You'll end up
with a radioactive shade of green.  If you're using a punch bowl, try
this: Get some of those latex gloves, fill them with water or juice,
freeze. Unmold carefully and float the disembodied hands in the punch
bowl. Dry ice and back lighting is good for effect too
