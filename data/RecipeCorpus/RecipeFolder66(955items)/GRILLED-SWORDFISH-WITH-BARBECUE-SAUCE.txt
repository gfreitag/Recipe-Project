Title: GRILLED SWORDFISH WITH BARBECUE SAUCE
Categories: Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Swordfish fillets
1 c  Catsup
1/3 c  Lemon juice
1/4 c  Oil
2 ts Worcestershire sauce
1 x  Clove garlic, minced
1/2 c  Chopped onion
1/4 c  Water
1 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Hot pepper sauce
1 x  Small bay leaf
Place fish in single layer in shallow baking dish. Combine 1/2 cup
catsup, lemon juice, oil, Worcestershire and garlic. Pour sauce over
fish. Cover and refrigerate about 1 hour, turning fish once. Remove
fish, reserving sauce.  Use half of reserved sauce for brushing fish
while grilling. Combine remaining half of sauce with remaining
catsup, onion, water, sugar, hot pepper sauce and bay leaf.  Simmer
about 20 minutes to blend flavors and thicken. Meanwhile, place fish
on well-greased, hinged wire grills. (If barbecuing fish on standard
grill, brush fish with oil before cooking.) Cook about 5 inches from
moderately hot coals 8 minutes. Baste with reserved sauce.  Turn and
cook 7 to 8 minutes longer, or until fish flakes easily when tested
with fork. Brush fish with more sauce as needed during cooking. To
serve, spoon hot barbecue sauce over fish.
