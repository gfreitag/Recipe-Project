Title: GRILLED TOURNEDOS OF BEEF WITH MUSHROOMS
Categories: Beef, Meats, Wine
Yield: 6 Servings
6    6-oz tournedos of beef;
-(center cuts of fillet
-mignon) denuded of fat
-and gristle and cut 1-1/2
-to 2-inches thick) OR
6    7-8 oz rib eye steaks
Salt and pepper to taste
4 tb Olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon
3    Cloves garlic; crushed
1 lg Onion; thinly sliced
1/2 lb Mushrooms; sliced
1/2 c  Red wine
Place the tournedos side by side in a shallow pan and sprinkle them
with salt and pepper.  Mix 2 tablespoons olive oil with the lemon,
garlic, and onion.  Rub the mixture into the tournedos. Set them
aside on a plate to marinate at room temperature for 1 hour.

Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over
high heat.  Remove the tournedos from the marinade and reserve it.
With a paper towel, wipe or blot the tournedos and add them to the
pan. Cook them to the preferred degree of doneness (about 8 minutes
for rare, 10 to 12 minutes for medium).  Remove them to a lightly
heated platter and keep them warm.

Add the marinade, mushrooms, and onions to the skillet and stir-fry
until the onions and mushrooms are lightly browned. Add the red wine.
Raise the heat to high to burn off the alcohol quickly. Cook until
the sauce reduces to a slightly creamy consistency, then spoon it
over the reserved tournedos.  Source:  Monday Night at Narsai's.
