Title: HACKBRATEN (FALSCHER HAS)
Categories: Beef, Pork, German
Yield: 4 Servings
250 g  Ground pork (a generous 1/2
-lb)
250 g  Ground beef (a generous 1/2
-lb)
100 g  Plain breadcrumbs (3.5 oz)
2    Eggs
1    Onion, finely chopped
1    Clove garlic, mashed or
-minced
1 bn Parsley, finely chopped
1 pn Sugar
2 tb Lard
1    Onion, sliced
4    To 5 cloves garlic, whole
1/2    Yellow turnip, sliced
-[substitute: carrot]
Water for pan gravy
Mix the ground meat with all the other ingredients [except for the
lard, the sliced yellow turnip, sliced onion, and whole garlic
cloves] and shape into a rectangular loaf. Put in a casserole dish
with the lard, the sliced onion, whole garlic cloves, and sliced
yellow turnip. Roast at 390 degrees F until the onions turn brown.
Then, add a little bit of water. Continue to roast, basting
frequently.  Add more water as needed. If the crust is getting too
dark, cover the top of the meatloaf with aluminum foil. In the olden
days, the cook put a clay tile on top of the meatloaf to achieve the
same effect.

At 390 degrees F, the meatloaf will be done after 1 1/2 hours and may
be served immediately, sliced, and topped with the reheated pan
juices.

Serve with potato salad or green salad [lettuce].

Serves 4.

[Note:  'Falscher Has' literally means imitation rabbit. K.B.]
