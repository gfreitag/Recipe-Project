Categories: Barbecue, Fruits
Yield: 4 Servings
4 tb Unsalted butter, melted
1/4 c  Packed dark-brown sugar
4    Ripe yellow or white
-peaches, cut in half

Heat a grill until medium hot, or heat the broiler. In a large bowl,
combine the melted butter and brown sugar. Add all fruit, and toss.
Fold the edges of a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil to form a
shallow baking pan, and place on grill.  Arrange the fruit, cut sides
down, on the foil. Cook fruit until browned and caramelized around
the edges, rearranging occasionally to prevent burning.  Turn the
fruit over, and repeat; serve warm.  Yield: 4  Typed in MM Format by
