Yield: 4 Servings

1/3 c  Olive oil
1 tb Fresh lemon juice or wine
Vinegar
2 tb Fresh basil; chopped
1 tb Shallots; chopped
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
3 lg Tomatoes; cut into slices
-1/2-3/4 inch thick
10    To 12 green onions; trimmed
Including 4" of green tops
Sprigs of fresh basil or
Parsley
Firm tomatoes, even those that are slightly green, should be used for
this recipe.  They are less juice and hold their shape better when
grilled than fully ripe ones. Fresh basil is wonderful with tomatoes,
but you could also use chopped tarragon or even parsley in the
basting sauce. Serve warm or at room temperature, with grilled lamb
or fish.

Prepare a fire in a grill.  Position the oiled grill rack 4-6 inches
above the fire.

In a small bowl stir together the oil, lemon juice or vinegar, chopped
basil, shallots, salt and pepper.

Arrange the tomatoes and onions on the rack. Grill, turning them two
or three times and brushing with the oil mixture, about 5 minutes. If
the onions are large, they might take 1 or 2 minutes longer.

Transfer the tomatoes and onions to a platter and garnish with basil
or parsley sprigs.
