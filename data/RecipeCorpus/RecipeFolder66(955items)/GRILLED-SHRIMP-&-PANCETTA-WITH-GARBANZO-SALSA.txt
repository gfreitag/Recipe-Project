2. Push a slender skewer through the pancetta and shrimp just above
the shrimp's tail and out through the pancetta at the fat end of the
shrimp. Push another pancetta-wrapped shrimp onto the skewer in the
same fashion; use 2 shrimp per skewer. If assembled ahead, cover and
chill up until the next day.
3. Lay shrimp on a grill 2-4" above a solid bed of medium-hot coal
