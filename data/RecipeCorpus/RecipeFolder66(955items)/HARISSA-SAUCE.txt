If using the dried chiles, soak them in a cup of hot water for 1
hour, then drain.  Pound or mince the chiles, garlic and salt into a
paste. Mix all or some of this paste, according to the degree of
hotness desired, with the broth, and serve hot, garnished with the
cilantro.

Aromatic Broth:

Put the chicken parts, turkey neck and giblets, butter, onions,
cardamom, cinnamon sticks, peppercorns and cloves into a heavy pan.
Cover and cook over medium-low heat for about 20 minutes, stirring
occasionally.

Before the mixture begins to brown, add the remaining ingredients
(except chopped cilantro).  Cover and simmer for 1 hour, skimming off
as much fat as possible. Raise the heat to medium and let the broth
cook, uncovered, for 1 hour.  The broth should reduce to about 7 cups
during this time. Season with salt and remove from heat.

Remove the pieces of chicken and discard.  Strain the broth through a
large sieve set over a large bowl, pressing against the vegetables.
Set aside 3 cups broth to make the harissa sauce. Serve the
remainder, piping hot, garnished with cilantro.
