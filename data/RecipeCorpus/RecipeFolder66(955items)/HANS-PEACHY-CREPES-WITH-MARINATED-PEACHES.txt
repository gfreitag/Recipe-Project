1 c  All-purpose flour
3    Egg yolks
3    Egg whites
2 tb Melted butter (unsalted)
1 pn Of salt
1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Water
*Beat egg whites until they reach a peak. Store in refrigerator. In
mixing bowl blend flour, egg yolks, salt, milk and water. Cover
mixture with damp cloth, let rest for two hours. Then, blend mixture
with egg whites and melted butter. Over medium high heat bring
buttered six-inch pan to sizzle. Ladle a little batter into frying
pan. Tilt and rotate so batter covers surface evenly. Pour any excess
batter back into bowl. Fry crepes lightly until brown on both sides.
For immediate use, cover crepes with foil and keep warm in low oven.
Or place crepes on plate, separate each crepe with a piece of
waxpaper. Cover all with plastic wrap and store in refrigerator.

NOTE: For sweet crepes add 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of
sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla sugar.

*Wash peaches, air dry, cut into bite-size pieces, remove pit.
Sprinkle with sugar, add orange juice, toss lightly. Squeeze lemon
juice over all, cover with plastic wrap and rest overnight at room
temperature. Just before serving, heat peach mixture in skillet.
Reheat crepes in dry pan over medium low heat. Place crepe on dessert
plate, ladle marinated peaches on one side of crepe topped with 2
tablespoons of ice cream (preferably a good quality french vanilla).
Serve immediately. For extra flavor, marinate peaches in 1/2 cup
Mandarine Napoleon liquer instead of the sugar and just before
serving ladle a good teaspoon of same liqueur over folded crepe.
