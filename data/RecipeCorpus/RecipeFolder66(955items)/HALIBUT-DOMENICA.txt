aside. Melt 2 tablespoons butter and blend 4 tablespoons flour to
make a roux. On low heat, gradually blend in 1 cup of fish liquid and
1 cup of milk. Bring to boil, stirring constantly, and cook 1 or 2

cool. Spoon sauce over halibut, covering completely. Scatter 1 cup
shredded Monterey Jack cheese over halibut. Bake, uncovered, in a 400
degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until sauce is bubbling around
edges and cheese has melted. Dust lightly with paprika or dill weed.
Garnish with chopped chives if desired. Serves 6.
