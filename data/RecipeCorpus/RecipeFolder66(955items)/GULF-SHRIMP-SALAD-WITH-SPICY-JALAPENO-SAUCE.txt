Kazuto is the head chef at Chinois on Main.  He has worked with me at
Ma Maison, Spago, and now at Chinois, where he developed this tasty
salad. (WP)

1. Prepare the sauce: In a blender or food processor fitted with the
steel blade, puree the tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, garlic, and tomato
paste. Transfer to a medium bowl. Chop the cilantro leaves very fine
and fold into the sauce.  Season with salt and pepper to taste and
set aside.

2. Peel the shrimp, leaving the tails intact.  Season lightly with
salt and pepper.  In a large skillet, heat the peanut oil. Without
crowding the pan, cook the shrimp, about 1-1.2 minutes on each side.
If necessary, do it it batches.

Presentation: Set the radicchio leaves on one half of a large serving
platter.  Toss the greens with the vinaigrette and spoon equal
mamounts into each of the radicchio leaves. Place the endive
attractively around the radicchio.  Spoon the sauce over the
remaining half of the platter and arrange the shrimp on the sauce.
Garnish with the garlic chives and julienne of peppers.  Serve
immediately. (You can also do this on individual platter, placing one
radicchio leaf on each plate, diving the remaining engredients
equally.)

To prepare ahead: Through step 1.  In step 2, peel the shrimp and
refrigerate, covered, until needed. Continue with the recipe at
serving time.

Chinois Vinaigrette: At Chinois, we combine rice wine vinegar, peanut
oil, soy sauce, and sesame oil to give the vinaigrette a distinctive
oriental flavor. (WP)

1. In a small bowl whisk together all the ingredients, seasoning with
salt and pepper to taste.  Use as needed.

To prepare ahead: Through step 1, refrigerating, covered, until
needed.
