Title: HALLOWEEN APPLES ON A STICK
Categories: Candies
Yield: 6 Servings
12 sm Red eating apples
12    Wooden skewere
3 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Light corn syrup
1 c  Water
Few drops oil of cloves
Red food coloring or:
12    Red cinnamon candies
Wash apples in hot water and dry. Insert a skewer in blossom end of
each apple. In a saucepan mix sugar, corn syrup, and water. Cook over
direct heat, stirring, until sugar dissolves. Add oil of cloves and a
little coloring. Continue cooking, without stirring, until a small
amount of mixture forms a hard piece that cracks when dropped into
cold water (290 F. on a candy thermometer). Set pan over boiling
water. Dip each apple into syrup, remove, and whirl apple until syrup
covers it smoothly. Stand apples, skewer side up, on tray or plate to
cool and harden.
