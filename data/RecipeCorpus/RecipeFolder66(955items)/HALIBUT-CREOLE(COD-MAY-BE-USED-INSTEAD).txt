Title: HALIBUT CREOLE(COD MAY BE USED INSTEAD)
Categories: Diabetic, Fish, Main dish
Yield: 1 Serving
1 1/4 lb 2 lbs Halibut Steaks;
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
3 lg Tomatoes; peeled, seeded
-and chopped
1/2 c  Green pepper; finely chopped
1/2 c  Onion; finely chopped
6 tb Butter; (yah. right.)
3 tb Lemon juice
1/8 ts Tabasco
(For a six oz (raw) steak, I used 2 small Tomatoes, kept the green
pepper and onion the same, threw in a chopped jalopena pepper,
replaced the 6 tbsp of butter with 1 tsp margarine, and used about a
tsp of Tabasco).

Preheat the oven to 400F. Butter a shallow baking dish large enough
to hold the fish in one layer, and place the fish in it. Season with
salt and pepper to tasted and spread the tomatoes, green pepper, and
onion over the top. Melt the butter with the lemon juice and Tabasco
and drizzle it over the fish and vegetables. Bake about 25 minutes,
basting with pan juices every
10    minutes.

(My way, without the butter, with a 4 oz (cooked) portion of the
fish, and about two-thirds of the vegetables, I counted it as 4
protein choices and 1 Fruit/Vegetable choice).
