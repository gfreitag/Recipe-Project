Title: GROUND OR CHOPPED MEAT
Categories: Canning, Meats
Yield: 1 Text  Bear, Beef, Lamb, Pork, Sausage, Veal, Venison

Procedure: Choose fresh, chilled meat. With venison, add one part
high-quality pork fat to three or four parts venison before grinding.
Use freshly made sausage, seasoned with salt and cayenne pepper (sage
may cause a bitter off-flavor). Shape chopped meat into patties or
balls or cut cased sausage into 3- to 4-inch links. Cook until
lightly browned. Ground meat may be sauteed without shaping. Remove
excess fat. Fill jars with pieces. Add boiling meat broth, tomato
juice, or water, leaving 1-inch headspace. Add 2 teaspoons of salt
per quart to the jars, if desired.

Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 and
Table 2 according to the canning method used.
