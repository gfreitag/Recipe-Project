Recipe by: Wilton Booklet Chop candy melts coarsely; set aside. Place
cream in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil,
stirring constantly. Once cream reaches a boil, remove from heat; add
chopped coating and cover pan. Let stand approximately 5 minutes, or
until coating has melted. Stir until smooth and creamy. Refrigerate
until firm. Roll into rounds. Truffles may be rolled in a variety of
coatings, such as cocoa, coconut or chopped nuts. Place in Halloween
Baking cups or pipe directly into candy cups. To pipe, refrigerate
truffle mixture just until it holds the shape when spooned. Place in
a decorating bag fitted with tip 21. Add mini pumpkin icing
