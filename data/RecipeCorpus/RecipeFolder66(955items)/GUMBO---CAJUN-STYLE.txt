Guaranteed to conjure up dreams of moss-draped oaks and the bayou.
This was developed with the help of a Cajun friend's memory of
watching his mama cook it every Friday night when he was a boy in
Louisiana. Making a "roux" with the flour and lard is the most
important part and the secret of a good gumbo.  Be careful and don't
let it burn.

In a heavy pan, melt the lard (shortening: over very low heat. Add
flour and stir continuously until it turns a tawny brown color (it
may take as long as 15 minutes, but don't rush it because if it
burns, the gumbo will be ruined).  Now add the onion, garlic, celery,
parsley, and green pepper and braise about 5 mintues, being careful,
again, not to burn it. Add tomato puree, 1 cup water, tuna, and
shrimp and simmer for 45 minutes. Add file' powder and serve over
fluffy steam rice.
