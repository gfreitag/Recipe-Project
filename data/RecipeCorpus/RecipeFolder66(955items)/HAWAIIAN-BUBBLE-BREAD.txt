Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Loaf
2 pk Dry yeast
1 ts Sugar
1 c  Warm water (105 degrees to
-115 degrees)
1 c  Sliced ripe banana
1/2 c  Pineapple-orange-banana
-juice concentrate,
-undiluted
1/4 c  Honey
2 tb Margarine, melted
2 dr Yellow food coloring
-(optional)
5 1/4 c  Bread flour, divided
1 ts Salt
Vegetable cooking spray
1/4 c  Cream of coconut
2 tb Pineapple-orange-banana
-juice concentrate,
-undiluted
1/2 c  Sifted powdered sugar
1 Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water; let stand 5 minutes.

2 Combine banana and next 4 ingredients in a blender; process until
smooth, and set aside.

3 Combine 2 cups flour and salt in a large bowl; stir well. Add yeast
mixture and banana mixture, stirring until well-blended. Add 2-3/4
cups flour, stirring to form a soft dough.

4 Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead until
smooth and elastic (about 8 minutes). Add enough of the remaining
flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent the dough from sticking to
hands.

5 Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to
coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from
drafts, 1-1/2 hours or until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down; turn
out onto a lightly floured surface, and let rest for 5 minutes. Form
the dough into 1-1/2-inch balls (about 30 balls) on a lightly floured
surface. Layer balls in a 10-inch tube pan coated with cooking spray;
set aside.

6 Combine the cream of coconut and 2 tablespoons juice in a bowl; stir
well. Pour 3 tablespoons juice mixture over dough, and set remaining
juice mixture aside. Cover dough, and let rise 1-1/2 hours or until
doubled in bulk.

7 Uncover dough, and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until loaf
sounds hollow when tapped. Let cool in pan 20 minutes. Remove from
pan; place on a wire rack. Stir powdered sugar into remaining juice
mixture; drizzle over top of warm bread. Yield: 1 loaf, 26 servings.
