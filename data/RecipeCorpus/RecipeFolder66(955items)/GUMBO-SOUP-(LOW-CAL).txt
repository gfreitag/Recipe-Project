Title: GUMBO SOUP (LOW CAL)
Categories: Vegetarian, Low-fat, Vegetables
Yield: 12 Servings
12 c  Water
6 ts Vegetable Bouillon granules
4    Tomatoes, fresh or 1-lb can
1/2 c  Corn, fresh or canned
1    Celery rib, diced
1    Onion, diced
1/2 c  Okra, cut
1/4 c  Rice, white or brown
1/8 ts Tabasco Sauce (optional)
1 c  Shredded cabbage (optional)
Directions: Place all ingredients in a large pot, bring to boil,
cover and simmer about 20 minutes until all vegetables are done.
1-l/2 C serving equals about
35    calories.

NOTE:  I use Uncle Ben's Converted Rice as it seems to hold its shape
better in long cooking periods.  Any rice will work if this soup is
not reheated several times, but it usually is!

This is a thin soup, I sometimes add shredded cabbage, chard, bok
choy, or other green vegetable to it.  The greens make it thicker and
more filling, but add few calories. This doesn't resemble the real
Cajun Gumbo, but is good for those days when you feel you've
over-indulged and need to cut back.  I keep in it the fridge and use
it as a snack when I just have to have something else. You can also
add herbs, hot pepper, it is very versatile, and a good starting
recipe.
