Title: GUILTLESS BROWNIES
Categories: Low-cal, Cookies
Yield: 24 Servings
3 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
2    Very ripe bananas
1/2 c  Sugar
2 lg Eggs
1 c  Whole-wheat flour
1/2 c  Chopped nuts
Preheat oven to 350 F.

Combine cocoa, oil and bananas in a food processor or blender. Puree
until smooth.  Combine sugar, eggs, flour and banana mixture in a
mixing bowl. Beat until blended, then stir in the nuts.

Pour the batter into a lightly oiled 9 x 13 inch baking pan and bake
for 15-20 minutes or until done. Toothpick inserted into center
should come out clean. (My suggestion - line baking pan with waxed
paper and spray with non-stick vegetable spray.)  Cut into 2 1/4 inch
squares when cool.

I'd suggest cutting into 48 squares, easier to eat and easier to fit
into a meal plan for a diabetic.  1/24 recipe fits within Am.
Diabetes Assoc. guideline of 1 tsp sugar per serving.
