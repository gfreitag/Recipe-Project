Title: HALVAS POLITIKOS
Categories: Desserts, Greek
Yield: 1 Dessert
1 c  Olive oil
2 c  Semolina
3 c  Sugar
4 c  Water
Cinnamon, powdered
Dissolve the sugar in the water and bring it to a boil. At the same
time, brown the semolina in the oil on high heat, stirring
continuously.

When the semolina has taken a golden brown colour, add the syrup into
it (taking care not to burn your hands), turn down the heat and keep
stirring until you get a kind of thick porridge. Pour into any kind
of mold you can think of (a cake-mold is perfect for the job), and
let it cool.

Unmold into a platter and sprinkle with cinnamon. Slice it using a wet
knife, serve, and watch your weight go sky high!

NOTES:

*  A Greek dessert with semolina -- This is a traditional greek
dessert that is extremely about tasty, and as easy to make as
1-2-3-4. Tasty. Yield: fills a cake-mold.

*  You should be very careful pouring the syrup into the browned
semolina, as it is extremely hot, and pouring water on it causes an
eruption of scaldingly hot steam.

*  You should not put this dessert in the refrigerator. It can keep
for a few days outside the refrigerator, assuming you can gather
enough will power not to eat it all at once. Some oil will start to
drain off after a day or so, but this is to be expected. Just make
sure you don't leave the dessert on your favourite tablecloth!

*  The recipe doubles, halves etc.  nicely as long as you keep the
proportion of the ingredients.

*  I have seen variations on this dessert using any kind of fat
imaginable, ranging from cooking fat to olive oil or butter, though
I've only tried it with olive oil.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15-20 minutes.
: Precision:  Measure the ingredients, except for the sugar which you
can adjust to taste.
