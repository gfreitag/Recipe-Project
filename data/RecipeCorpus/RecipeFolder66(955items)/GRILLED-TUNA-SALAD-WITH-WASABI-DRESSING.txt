Categories: Main dish, Fish, Salads
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Soy sauce (+ 2 teaspoons)
1 tb Olive oil (+ 2 teaspoons)
1 1/4 lb Fresh tuna steak
4 ts Wasabi powder *
2 tb Tahini * (sesame paste)
2 tb Rice vinegar
1 ts Dijon mustard
1 ts Sugar
2    Garlic cloves, minced
Salt & pepper to taste
7 oz Alfalfa sprouts (2 cups)
7 oz Trimmed enoki mushrooms *
1/2 lb Young spinach, stemmed
2 tb Slivered pickled ginger *
* Available at Asian Markets, well-stocked grocery stores and some
health food markets.

(Note:  In place of wasabi, you could use an equal amount of powdered
dry mustard)

In a shallow glass dish, combine 1 T of the soy sauce and 1 t of the
oil. Add the tuna and coat well. Refrigerate for about 15 minutes,
turning fish twice.

Light grill or preheat broiler.  In small bowl, mix wasabi powder
with 4 t of hot water.  Cover and set aside for 5 minutes.

In another bowl, stir 2 T of warm water into the tahini. Stir in the
wasabi paste, vinegar, mustard, sugar, garlic and the remaining 2 t
soy sauce and 4 t oil. Season with salt and pepper.

Season the tuna with salt and pepper; grill or broil until crusty on
the outside and rare within, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the
fish to a plate to rest for a few minutes, then slice it against the
grain 1/3 inch thick.

In large bowl, toss the alfalfa sprouts with the enoki mushrooms and
all but 2 T of the dressing.  Scatter spinach leaves on 4 large
plates and arrange tuna on top. Drizzle on the remaining 2 T
dressing. Mound the sprout salad on the tuna, scatter the pickled
ginger on top and serve.
