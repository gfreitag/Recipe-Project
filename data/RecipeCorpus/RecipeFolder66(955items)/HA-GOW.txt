Yield: 24 Servings
Filling:
Wheat starch for dusting
1/2 lb Raw shrimp, peeled and
-chopped
1/4 lb Precooked salad shrimp,
-chopped
2 oz Pork fat, chopped fine
1/4 c  Bamboo shoots, chopped
1/4 ts Ground white pepper
1/4 ts Grated fresh ginger
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Sesame oil
1 tb Chopped green onion
1    Egg white
1 tb Dry sherry
1 tb Cornstarch
Dough:
2 tb Potato starch
1 c  Wheat starch
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Boiling water, plus
3 tb Boiling water
1 ts Lard
Place all filling ingredients in a bowl and mix well, by hand until
the ingredients form a smooth and rather firm stuffing. This will
take about 2 minutes. Dough: Measure both starches and salt into a
small mixing bowl. Quickly pour the boiling water into the starches
while stirring with chopsticks until you get a partially cooked
dough. Do not overwork the dough. Quickly add the lard in little
pinches and then knead until smooth. When the dough is smooth, after
about 2 minutes' kneading, cover it with the mixing bowl and allow it
to rest for 15 minutes before shaping. To shape the dumplings, pull
just a bit more than 1 tsp of dough from the ball.  Keep the
remainder of the dough covered with the bowl. Roll the small amount
into a ball and place onto a floured marble board. Roll out into a
circle about 3 inches in diameter. Place 1 t of the shrimp filling in
the center of the circle of dough and fold over into a half-moon. Use
a tiny bit of water for sealing the edges.  Be sure to gently press
out all the air.  If you wish, you can form little pleats in the
dough for added decoration. Steam on an oiled bamboo steaming rack
for 12 minutes. From The Frugal Gourmet Cooks Three Ancient Cuisines,
