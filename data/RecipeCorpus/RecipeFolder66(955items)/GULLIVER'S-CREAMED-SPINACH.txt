Title: GULLIVER'S CREAMED SPINACH
Categories: Entrees
Yield: 6 Servings
10 oz Spinach, chopped
-(frozen or fresh)
3 sl Bacon
1 sm Onion
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
3 tb Flour
1 1/4 c  Milk (we substitute
-a like quantity of
-50/50 Kosher Parve
-creamer and water)
Rinse and chop the spinach.  Place the chopped spinach in a heavy
skillet, cover, and steam until wilted, stirring occasionally. There
is no need to add water other than what clings to the leaves from
washing. (If you are using frozen spinach, place over low or medium
heat to thaw and allow excess water to evaporate) Transfer to small
bowl and squeeze completely dry.

Grind bacon and onion very fine and place in saucepan. Saute bacon and
onion until bacon is cooked. Stir in flour to make smooth paste.
Gradually add milk. Bring to boil and simmer 10 minutes over low heat
until thickened.

Add salt and pepper.  Grind spinach fine and add to cream sauce.

NOTES:

*  Creamed spinach with bacon -- This is a creamed spinach recipe
that we found in the _Los Angeles Times_. It produces a creamed
spinach that even my wife likes.

*  You may find that you want to add extra milk and give the finished
soup a final heating in the microwave. We did, and it didn't hurt it
one bit.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
