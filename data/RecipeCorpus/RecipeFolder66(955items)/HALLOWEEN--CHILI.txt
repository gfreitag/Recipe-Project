Preparation : Substitutions are in parenthesis. Best made during the
last phase of the moon, if that is not possible, just do the best you
can in a softly lighted kitchen after dark. Brown the gizzards in an
iron cauldron over a fire made from the siding off of a haunted
house, add chopped eye of cyclops and simmer until the pieces of eye
become translucent again, add blood of bat, and soft shelled beetles,
bring to a slow bubbling boil. At this time, add the common weed,
maggots, toenails, sumac, grubs, hemlock, eye of newt and the pureed
wasp. As it cooks you may want to adjust the consistency with pond
water. You can tell it is done when the eye of newt swells and the
vertical tan colored 'cats eye' appears on one side.
