2 pk Refrigerator sugar cookie
-dough rolls
Flour for board and rolling

Heavy card-type paper or

Cut each sugar cookie dough roll in half. Form each into a ball and
flatten into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate about 45
minutes until firm. Draw and cut out hand shapes of family members to
use as guides for making cookies. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
(check temperature on cookie dough package.) Working with one dough
ball at a time on floured board, roll out to about 1/4 inch thick.
Use enough flour so dough isnt sticky and can be easily removed to
cookie sheet. Place paper hand cut-out on dough and trace with a
sharp knife, making cookie hands. Place on cookie sheets & bake until
light golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool on rack completely
before decorating. Repeat with all cookie dough. Decorate using
icings and candies. You can even write family members names on each.
This is the fun part to do with kids!
