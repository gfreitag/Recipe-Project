Title: HAM TURNOVERS (USDA)
Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
FILLING -----
2 1/2 lb Cooked ham, finely chopped
(8 cups)
1 1/3 tb Instant minced onion
8 oz Canned tomato sauce
1 1/3 tb Parsley flakes
1/4 ts Pepper
1 ts Dry mustard
1 ts Prepared horseradish
PASTRY -----
6 1/2 c  Unsifted flour
2 ts Salt
2 c  Shortening
3/4 c  Cold water
FILLING:  Mix ham, onion, tomato sauce, parsley flakes, pepper,
mustard, and horseradish. Set aside.

PASTRY:  Mix flour and salt.  Mix in shortening only until mixture is
crumbly.  Add cold water and mix quickly. Let dough rest 15 minutes.

Divide dough into 24 pieces; form into balls.  Roll each ball out on
lightly floured surface to make a circle about 5 inches in diameter,
about 1/8-inch thick. Place about 3 tablespoons ham mixture onto one
half of each pastry circle. Fold other half of circle over ham
mixture. Seal edge by pressing with tines of a fork.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Place
turnovers on baking sheet.  Bake 30 minutes or until lightly browned.
Serve with Mushroom Sauce or Vegetable Sauce.

TO FREEZE:  Place six turnovers at a time in a single layer on freezer
wrap. Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put
edges of wrap together and fold several times so paper lies directly
on top of food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with
freezer tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last
date the food should be used for best eating quality (about 6
months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12 hours before stacking
packages.

TO HEAT FROZEN TURNOVERS:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Remove
freezer wrap.  Place food on a baking sheet. Bake 45 minutes or until
turnovers are lightly browned. Serve with Mushroom Sauce or Vegetable
Sauce.
