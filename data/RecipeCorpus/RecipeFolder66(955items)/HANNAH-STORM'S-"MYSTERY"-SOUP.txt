Before making her name as CNN's sole female sportscaster, Hannah
Storm was famous for her misadventures in the kitchen. "When I was
younger, my brothers used to make fun of me," says Storm. "Once, I
was following this wonderful chocolate-coffee bundt cake recipe, and
I used a cup of freeze-dried coffee grounds. The joke circulated
around the family for years, 'I ate a piece of Hannah's cake and was
up for two days straight'."

Storm has since honed her culinary skills. One dish she's mastered is
her mother's famous pumpkin soup. "This soup was always a mystery
soup for anyone outside of the family," says Storm. "My mother never
liked to tell people what was in it because they probably wouldn't
try it."

pumpkin. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir
in cream, honey, nutmeg and serve.
