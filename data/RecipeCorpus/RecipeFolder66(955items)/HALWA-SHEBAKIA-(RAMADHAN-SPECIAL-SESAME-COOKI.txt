"This recipe is frankly for historical purposes as its yield indicates
suitability for commercial or restaurant production rather than home
baking. With unusual proportions of butter, oil and honey in the
batter, yeast for rising and more oil for frying, making the cookies
would be rather daunting were it not for the fact that they help
glorify a particularly holy celebration."

1. In a food processor process all the ingredients, except the honey,
into a paste.

2. Take a walnut-sized piece of paste and roll it out very thin.
Using a metal cut-out typically found in Morocco, with different
designs, cut out cookies and let them rise for 15 minutes. Deep-fry
the cookies in the remaining quart of oil in batches over low heat
just to brown.

3. Soak the cookies in the honey for 15 minutes. Remove and sprinkle
with toasted sesame seeds.

Makes several hundred cookies.
