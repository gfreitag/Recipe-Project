Guajalote en mole Poblano Put the turkey to simmer with the onions
and garlic. They should simmer till the meat is ready to slip, not
fall, off the bones.

Meanwhile, fry the tortilla and the roll in oil till crisp.

Using a mortar or blender, grind the crisp bread up with the herbs,
spices, almonds, and chocolate until well mixed.

Remove the turkey, onion, and garlic from broth. Discard the onion and
garlic, and cook the broth down to 2 or 3 cups. Reduce to a simmer,
and slowly stir in the blended ingredients. Return the turkey to the
sauce, and simmer for another 20 minutes.
