Title: HALFWAY HOUSE POT ROAST
Categories: Main dishes, Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Lean beef
1/4 lb Butter
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Good rum
Bay leaf
6 x  Onions
Clove garlic
5 x  Pepper corns
1 ts Sugar
1 tb Grated Horseradish
6 x  Carrots
6 x  Potatoes
Saute a minced clove of garlic in a little butter untill butter is
well flavored.  Remove the garlic, and place the meat in the butter,
brown it well on all sides. Add the rum and then place the meat and
liquids in a kettle, adding enough water to cover.
Add horseradish, bay leaf, peppercorns, salt and sugar. Boil hard
untill water is reduced one-half and meat is nearly done. Now add
whole onions, carrots, and potatoes, and cook in the liquid. Test
untill all are done. Then remove from the liquid, which is now made
into gravy by thickening with a little flour and water smoothly
mixed. (Old recipe from the "Halfway House" Madrid, Maine)
