mix well.  Add to shortening mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing
lightly with a fork until mixture forms a ball.  Cover and chill for
30    minutes.

Meanwhile, combine the first 6 filling ingredients. Divide pastry
into 15 equal portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one
portion into a 6 1/2" circle.  Mound a heaping 1/3 cup filling on
half of circle. Moisten edges with water; fold dough over filling and
press edges with a fork to seal. Transfer to a greased baking sheet.
Repeat with remaining pastry and filling.

Cut 3 slits in the top of each turnover; brush with cream. Bake
at 375 degrees for 35-40 minutes or until vegetables are tender and
crust is golden brown.
