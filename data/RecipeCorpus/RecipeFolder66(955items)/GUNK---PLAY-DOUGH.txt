Add food coloring to the water to desired color, stir into the
cornstarch. When the cornstarch is dissolved, drop the whole batch
onto a tray for the child to play with.

This is almost a liquid, so makes a fun change from other doughs.
Clean up is the easiest of all doughs, as when it dries it is simply
swept up.

Any that is left can be plaed in a clean glass jar and let dry. It
can then be reconstituted by simply adding water.
