Yield: 1 Servings

According to an article in the "LA Times", Nov. 23, 1991, there are
probably more cases of food poisoning, in the US, at least, on
Thanksgiving than any other day of the year.  This is mainly due to
improper handling, preparing, and cooking the family turkey. The US
Dept of Agrigulture offers several iron-clad rules for preparing the
turkey in such a way as to limit the spread and growth of bacteria in
the process. They are: *
Make sure juices from the uncooked bird do not drip onto other
foods, even in the refrigerator. * Carefully wash everything: hands,
utensils, sink, etc. that comes in contact with the raw bird. Use
soap and hot water. *
Don't defrost a frozen turkey at room temperature. Defrost it
in the refrigerator, allowing one day in the refrigerator for each 5
pounds of bird. *
Don't stuff the bird until just before it goes into the oven.
Don't cook the bird at temperatures less than
Stuff itloosely. *
325 F. Long, slow cooking at low temperatures allows bacteria to
grow. * Don't partially cook the bird the day before and finish
cooking it Thanksgiving day. Cook it in a single, complete operation.
You can hasten the cooking process by using commercial oven cooking
bags, and by cooking the stuffing seperately. * Don't refrigerate a
whole, cooked turkey. Carve the bird, cover and refrigerate the meat.
Reheat before serving, making sure the meat and stuffing reach
approximately 165 F. , steaming hot. * Don't allow the cooked bird to
stand unrefrigerated for more than 2 hours after removing from the
oven.  A frequent practice is to carve just enough meat from the bird
to serve the meal, and to finish carving the remainder of the bird
later.  Do not let later take too long. * Don't use regular paper
grocery bags to cover the bird in the oven. Toxins from glue in the
seams can cause illness.
