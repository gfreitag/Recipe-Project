Title: HASSELBACK POTATOES
Categories: Potatoes
Yield: 8 Servings
8 md Baking potatoes
Butter
Salt
3 tb Dried bread crumbs
Parmesan cheese, grated
Peel potatoes and place in large spoon.  Slice downwards at 1/4-inch
intervals. The spoon will prevent cutting all the way through the
potato. As you work, put potatoes in cold, salted water.

Drain potatoes and pat dry.  Put potatoes, cut-side up, in large
buttered baking dish. Baste with butter. Sprinkle with salt. Bake 30
minutes in 425-degree oven.

Baste with remaining butter and sprinkle crumbs over each potato.
Bake 15 minutes longer or until golden and tender. Add cheese five
minutes before potatoes are done.
