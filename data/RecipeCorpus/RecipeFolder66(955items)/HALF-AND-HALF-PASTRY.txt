Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Granulated sugar
1/4 c  Shortening
pn Pinch of salt
1/4 c  Cold butter
3 tb To 5 Tbsp cold water
1.  Blend flour, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl. Cut butter
and
shortening into 1/2-inch cubes and add to flour mixture. Using a
pastry blender or 2 knives, cut into dry mixture until it is the
con-
sistency of coarse meal.

2.  Then gradually sprinkle 3 tablespoons cold water over flour
mixture,
using a fork to work liquid into dry ingredients. Then work in
just
enough remaining cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, so dough can
be
gathered into a firm ball.

3.  Flatten ball slightly with the palm of your hand. Wrap pastry and
refrigerate at least until chilled, about 30 minutes. Pastry will
keep
well for several days.  It also freezes well.
