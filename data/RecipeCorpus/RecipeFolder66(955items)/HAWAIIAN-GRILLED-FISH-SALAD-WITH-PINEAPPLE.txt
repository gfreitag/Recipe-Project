heat remaining oil in a medium skillet.  Add yellow pepper and onion

fish 4 to 5 inches from hot coals, turning once, until fish is barely
opaque in the center, and just begins to flake when tested with a
fork about 2 minutes per side for 3/4-inch thick fish steaks.  Divide
spinach and romaine among six plates and place a grilled fish steak
on each. Top with pineapple salsa as a dressing. Yield: 6 servings.
