Forgot to include this in the packet from the other board. Karin
Brewer sent me the following recipe via snail mail. Apparently
there's a large, semi-permanent black hole hovering over her house
and she's having trouble getting out.  Been wondering where she was...

Maguey worms, a Mexican specialty, are popular in the state of
Hidalgo, where maguey grows abundantly.  The worms were sold in
cocoons on the street until a few years ago. Today, this dish is
considered to be a delicacy.

Heat 1 cup oil in a thick skillet and fry worms until crisp. Remove
and drain on paper towels.

Heat 4 cups oil in a deep saucepan or deep fryer. Press tortillas in
a mesh strainer, and fry one by one until they become crisp and take
the shape of the strainer. Drain well on paper towels.

To serve, place a little ball of masa on each of 8 plates, and put
tortilla "baskets" on top, pressing to fix in place. Fill tortillas
with worms. Garnish with lime slices and flowers. Serve with
guacamole and green sauce. This appetizer is good with tequila or
pulque.

The worms can also be used as a taco stuffing.

Makes 8 servings.
