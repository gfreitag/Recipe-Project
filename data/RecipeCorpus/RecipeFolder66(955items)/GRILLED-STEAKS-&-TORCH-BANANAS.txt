Preheat the barbecue - it is ready when all the coals have an even
coating of thick, gray ash. Score the fat edges of the steaks every
2". Place the steaks in a shallow dish. Combine the marinade
ingredients. Pour the marinade over the steaks. Turn the steaks.
Cover. Marinate refrigerated for at least 3 hours, turning once. Peel
the bananas. Cut each banana in half lengthwise. Brush with lemon
juice. Make "cups" out of foil to hold the bananas, two banana halves
to each "cup". Mix the pineapple juice, butter and honey. Brush the
bananas with this mixture. Sprinkle with shredded coconut. Bring the
top of the foil over to fully enclose the bananas.
