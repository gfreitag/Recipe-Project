Title: HARVEST APPLE PIE (QUAKER)
Categories: Desserts, Pies
Yield: 1 9-inch pie
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
6 c  Peeled & sliced apples
-- (cooking type)
1 c  Sugar
2 tb All-purpose flour
3/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Nutmeg
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Shortening
1/2 c  Quaker Oats, uncooked
-- (quick or old-fashioned)
6 tb COLD water
For filling, combine all ingredients; set aside.

For crust, sift together flour and salt.  Cut in shortening until
mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in oats. Sprinkle water by
tablespoonfuls over mixture; stir lightly with fork until just
dampened. (If necessary, add another tablespoon cold water to make
dough hold together.) Form into ball.

Turn out on lightly floured board or canvas.  Divide dough in half.
Roll one half to form a 13-inch circle. Fit loosely into a 9-inch pie
plate. Trim, allowing 1/4 inch beyond rim. Fill with apple mixture.
Dot with 2 tablespoons butter or margarine.  Roll other half of dough
to form a 12-inch circle.  Cut slits in shapes of apples and leaves
to allow steam to escape.

Adjust crust over filling; trim so crust extends 1/2 inch beyond rim.
Fold top crust over bottom crust. Flute edges. Bake in preheated very
hot oven (450 F.) about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 F. Bake 30 to
35 minutes longer or until apples are tender and crust is golden
brown.
