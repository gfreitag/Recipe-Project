Title: GUACAMOLE SALAD
Categories: Mexican, Salads, Appetizers
Yield: 4 Servings
5 ea Large avocados
1 ea Medium garlic clove, minced
1 ea Medium tomato, chopped
4 oz Can chopped green chili
2 1/2 tb Lemon or lime juice
1 ts Salt
Peel and chop avocados into a bowl. Mash with garlic and lemon juice.
Add remaining ingredients, mixture will be chunky. To prepare
individual salads, spoon mixture on shredded or whole lettuce leaves.
Top with diced tomato for garnish and serve with tortilla chips. If
made ahead of time, save pit and put in dip until time to serve to
prevent darkening. NOTE: This is my own recipe and the chili can be
adjusted to taste. Also, I sometimes replace the tomato and green
chili with salsa.
