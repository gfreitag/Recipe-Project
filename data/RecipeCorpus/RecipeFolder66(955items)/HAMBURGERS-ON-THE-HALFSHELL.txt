Title: HAMBURGERS ON THE HALFSHELL
Categories: Hamburger, Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
1 x  Ground Hamburger
1 x  Tomato sauce
1 x  Onions
1 x  Black and/or red pepper
1 x  Salt
1 x  Black Olive, minced(optional
Mix some ground meat with a little tomato sauce to moisten and coat;
add onions, black and/or red pepper and salt (+whatever, to taste,
eg, a little minced black olive); spread mixture on 1/2 hamburger
bun, top with grated cheese of choice; toast *briefly* under broiler
or in toaster oven till cheese melts and topping is hot and just
crusty. (If using oven broiler, be careful as the burger buns burn
very quickly. I suggest leaving the oven door open for the short time
it takes to set these, and keeping an eye on them.) P.S. I'd make
sure meat is cooked before serving.
