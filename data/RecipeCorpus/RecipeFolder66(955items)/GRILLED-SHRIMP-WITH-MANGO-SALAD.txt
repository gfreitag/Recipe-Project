Categories: Main dish, Salads, Seafood, Shellfish, Low-fat

2    Firm, not-quite-ripe mangoes
2 tb Thinly sliced shallots
6 tb Lime juice

1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Minced garlic
1 ts Minced serrano chili
1 lb Shrimp
2 c  Watercress sprigs, washed

With a sharp knife, cut peel from mangoes.  Coarsley shred mangoes by
sliding them across a hand shredder.

In a bowl, mix shallots, lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, garlic and
chili. Add shredded mangoes, mix and set aside.

Shell and devein shrimp; rinse well.  Divide shrimp into 4 equal
portions. Thread 1 portion onto 2 parallel skewers (to keep shrimp
from rotating around skewer). Repeat with remaining shrimp.

in center of thickest part, about 6 minutes.
