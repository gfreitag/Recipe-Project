Title: GRISSINI AL FINOCCHIO (FENNEL BREAD STICKS)
Categories: Breads, Herb/spice, Italian
Yield: 60 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
3/4 c  ;Warm water (abt. 110 F.)
3/4 c  Salad oil
3/4 c  Beer
1 ts Salt
1 tb Fennel seeds
4 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1    Egg, beaten w/1 tb. water
In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over warm water and let stand 5
minutes to soften.  Stir in salad oil, beer, salt and fennel seeds.
With a heavy-duty mixer or wooden spoon, beat in 3 1/2 c. flour until
dough is elastic (about 5 minutes).

On a board or pastry cloth, spread remaining 1 c. flour and turn out
dough. Knead, using this technique: lift edge of dough, coated well
with flour, and fold toward center, avoiding contact with sticky part
of dough. Continue folding toward center and kneading, turning dough
as you work, until it is smooth and elastic. Place dough in a greased
bowl; turn dough to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place
until doubled (1 to 1 1/4 hours).

On a floured surface, knead just to expel air.  Pinch off lumps (1
1/2" in diameter) and roll each into a strip that is 18" long. Cut
each strip in half.

Set wire racks on baking sheets and arrange strips across racks, 1/2"
apart.  Brush strips with egg-water mixture. Bake at 325 F. for about
35 minutes or until evenly browned. Serve hot, or cool on wire racks.
