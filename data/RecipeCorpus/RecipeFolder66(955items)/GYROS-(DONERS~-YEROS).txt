Title: GYROS (DONERS~ YEROS)
Categories: Greek
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Lean lamb, ground
2    Bread slices;toasted,crushed
1 ts Allspice; pounded (?)
1 ts Coriander; crushed
1    Garlic clove; crushed
1    Onion; grated
1 ts Chopped fresh savory
Salt & freshly ground pepper
3    Slices bacon (?!!)
6    Pita bread pockets
2    Tomatoes; sliced thin
Vinegar & oil to taste
1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
1 c  Plain yogurt
In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb with the bread, allspice,
coriander, garlic, onion, savory, and salt and pepper, and knead
thoroughly.  The mixture should be spicy, though not too herby, and
hold its shape. Break into 5 sections, each as large as a navel
orange, then break each section into 6 balls. Knead and flatten
slightly to a thickness of about 3/4". Cut the bacon slices into
widths equal to these balls, keeping the slices of bacon between
them.  Slip a cane skewer through the centers and roll gently with
the palms to smooth the edges.

(There will be 5 or 6 skewers, depending on their length.) Cover and
refrigerate overnight.  When ready to cook, set on a broiler tray or
grill and cook under moderate heat, turning every 5 minutes. (The
bacon will baste the meat.)  The surface will be crusty and the
inside cooked within 25 minutes.  To serve:  Put out the bread, meat,
tomatoes seasoned with the vinegar and oil, parsley and yogurt in
separate dishes. Guests may open pocket bread and stuff them with
meat and seasonings.
