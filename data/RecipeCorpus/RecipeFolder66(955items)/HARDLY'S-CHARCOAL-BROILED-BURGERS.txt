Mix the ground beef and the salt and pepper together in a bowl,
blending well. Shape into 4 patties about 1/4-inch thick. Place the
patties on a grill 4 to 6 inches from the heat over grey-hot coals.
Grill about 4 minutes on each side or to the desired doneness.
Meanwhile, on the same grill in a small saucepan, melt the butter
and
add the 1 cup of sliced onion.  Cook until crisp tender. Remove the
onion with a slotted spoon and reserve.  Stir the catsup and mustard
into the butter left in the sauce pan and heat to serving
temperature. When the hamburgers are done, place each one on a
toasted bottom, and top first with some of the cooked onion and then
a dollop of the catsup-mustard mixture and then garnish as desired.
Makes 4 Hamburgers.
