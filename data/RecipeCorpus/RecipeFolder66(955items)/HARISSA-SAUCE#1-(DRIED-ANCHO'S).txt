Title: HARISSA SAUCE#1 (DRIED ANCHO'S)
Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 12 Servings
4    Dried chile anchos
1/8 c  Tomato paste
4 tb Olive oil
4 ts Cayenne
6 md Garlic cloves
2 ts Cumin
2 ts Coriander
3/4 c  Water or reconstituted chile
Water
Reconstitute the anchos by putting them in a pot of hot water and
soaking until soft, about 20 minutes. While the chiles are soaking,
puree all the ingredients except the water in a blender or food
processor.

Remove the anchos from the pot (reserving the water), stem and tear
them into several pieces, and add to the blender. Taste the chile
water, and if not bitter, add 3/4 cup to the blender (otherwise add
water). Puree until smooth. For a thinner sauce, add more chile water
in small increments until you reach the desired consistency.
Refrigerated, harissa will keep for several weeks.
