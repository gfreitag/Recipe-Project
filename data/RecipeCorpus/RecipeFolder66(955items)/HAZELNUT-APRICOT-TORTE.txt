MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3 c  Heavy cream
10 oz White chocolate
3 tb Hazelnut liqueur
3/4 c  Apricot jam
1 1/2 c  Roasted Oregon hazelnuts,

Yield: 10 to 12 servings.

Melt white chocolate in double boiler, cool to lukewarm. Beat egg
whites until frothy. Add cream of tartar and gradually add 2
tablespoons of the sugar. Whip to firm, but not dry peaks; set aside.
Cream butter and remaining sugar. Beat in egg yolks and mix in along
with the hazelnuts. Lighten batter by whisking in 1 cup of the egg
whites. Gently fold in remaining egg whites. Pour into greased,
parchment-lined 11x17x1-inch baking pan. Bake in 375 oven for 10 to
12 minutes, or until golden and set. Cool.

For filling, heat cream to simmering. Remove from heat and stir in
white chocolate until melted. Chill. When cold, beat to medium
whipped cream consistency. Beat in liqueur. Remove 1-1/2 cups of the
filling and whisk in 1/4 cup apricot jam. To assemble, trim edges off
cake. Slice vertically in four equal pieces, about 3-1/2 inches wide
and 10 inches long. Stack three layers, spreading each with apricot
jam and 1/3 of the apricot filling. Place fourth layer on top and
spread top and sides with white chocolate cream. Press chopped
hazelnuts into sides and decorate top with apricot jam and white
chocolate rosettes. Keep refrigerated.
