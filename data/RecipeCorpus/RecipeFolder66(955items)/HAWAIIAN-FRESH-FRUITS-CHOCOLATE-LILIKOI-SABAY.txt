For Sabayon:
2 oz Hawaiian Vintage Chocolate
-melted
1/4 c  Sugar
6    Egg yolks
1/4 c  Lilikoi (passion fruit)
1/4 c  Water
Hawaiian fresh fruits:
2    Papaya
2    Mangoes; peeled; seeded
12    Strawberries; cleaned
-with stems removed; sliced
4    Sprigs fresh mint leaves
To prepare the fruits:  Peel the papaya, prepare into melon balls and
set aside.  Take one half of mango and finely sliced lengthwise. Then
take one twelve-inch plate and start making the design with the mango
into a triangle leaving the center empty, then add the sliced
strawberries inside theh triangle in one layer. Add the melon balls
of papaya in the center. Repeat this for the rest of the plates.

To prepare the sabayon:

Melt the Hawaiian Vintage Chocolate in a medium size bowl over a
double boiler. When melted turn off the heat. In a separate bowl,
cream the egg yolks and sugar well but do not beat them. Place the
bowl in hot water bath, taking great care that the bottom of the bowl
containing the egg and sugar mixture does not tough the hot bottom of
the pan beneath. Pour the lilikoi and wate into the bowl of egg yolks
and sugar, stirring continuously.  The hot water bath should not come
to a boil but be kept just below simmering point. Now beat the
mixture energetically with the balloon whish until it froths and has
doubled in volume and until it is mixted consistenly like a ribbon.
Pour chocolate into sabayon and mix together.  Serve with Hawaiian
fruits. Garnish with sprig of mint.
