Title: HAM HOCKS & BLACK-EYED PEAS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Smoked ham hocks; (or
A meaty ham bone; or pieces
-of slab ba
Rind on)
2 c  Dried black-eyed peas; (1#)
1 c  Onions; coarsely chopped
2 md Celery stalks; trimmed of
-all leave
Chopped
1    Fresh hot red chili; about
Chopped
Freshly ground black pepper
Place the ham hocks in a heavy 4 to 6 quart pot and add enough water
to cover the meat by at least 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat,
reduce the heat to low and simmer partially covered for 2 hours, or
until the ham hocks are tender and show no resistance when pierced
deeply with the point of a small skewer or sharp knife.

In a sieve or colander, wash the black-eyed peas under cold running
water until the draining water is clear. Add the peas, onions,
celery, chili and a few grindings of black pepper to the pot, mix
well, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low and
simmer partially covered for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the peas are
tender. Check the pot from time to time and add more boiling water if
necessary. When the peas are fully cooked, they should have absorbed
almost all of the pan liquid.

Taste for seasoning and serve at once from a heated platter or bowl.

NOTE: The volatile oils in fresh hot chilies may burn your skin or
make your eyes smart, so clean, stem and seed them under running
water. Wear rubber gloves if you can and be careful not to touch your
face or eyes. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water.
