Title: HABANERO PEPPER SAUCE - AGENT ORANGE
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
12    Habanero Peppers, Stems
-Removed, Peppers Chopped
1/2 c  Chopped Onion
2    Cloves Garlic, Minced
1 tb Vegetable Oil
1/2 c  Chopped Carrots
1/2 c  Distilled Vinegar
1/4 c  Lime Juice
Saute the onion and garlic in oil until soft; add the carrots with a
small amount of water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until
carrots are soft.

Place the mixture and raw chiles into a blender and puree until
smooth. Don't cook the peppers, since cooking reduces flavor of the
Habaneros. Combine the puree with vinegar and lime juice, then simmer
for 5 minutes and seal in sterilized bottles.

Heat Index : 9 on a scale of 1-10.
