Title: HADDOCK DUGLERE
Categories: Barry, Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Haddock Fillets, Skinned
1 oz Butter
1 oz Oil
2 oz Flour
1 lg Beefsteak Tomato
5 fl Double cream
Salt and Pepper
In a large non-stick frying pan, melt the butter in the oil until it
stops sizzling. Coat fish lightly in flour and fry gently for 4
minutes each side. Peel tomato by covering it with boiling water for
30 seconds. The skin should slip off - mind your fingers, though! cut
tomato in half, scoop out seeds and cut flesh into half-inch strips.
Put these into pan with fish and cook gently for 1 minute. Take fish
out and put it on to to warm plates. Pour cream into pan and bring it
to boil - double cream won't curdle - stirring so it picks up all the
lovely fish and tomato bits. Season, then pour the sauce over the
fish. Mashed potatoes are perfect with it.
