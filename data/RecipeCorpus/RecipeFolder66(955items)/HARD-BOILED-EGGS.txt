Yield: 1 Recipe  ************** LET'S COOK IT RIGHT IN THE SHELL ******************
*********** COLD WATER METHOD - PERFECT EVERY TIME ***********

1.  Place eggs in saucepan and cover to depth of about 1 inch with
cold water.  Use small pan for 1 to 4 eggs. 2. Bring to boiling
point, cover pan and set off heat or reduce temperature to keep water
below simmering point. 3.  Start to time eggs immediately. For Grade
A large eggs, allow 3,4 or 5 minutes for a soft, medium thick or firm
yolk; For Extra large 1/2 minute longer; for a Medium egg 1/2 minute
less. 4.  If eggs cannot be served immediately DIP in cold water to
stop cooking, otherwise they continue to cook when removed from hot
water. 5. To hard cook eggs allow 25 minutes for large adding
approximiately 3 minutes more for Extra large or deducting 3 minutes
for Medium size. Allow less cooking time for small eggs. Chill in
cold water.

**************TO TEST HARD-COOKED EGGS******************

A trick to use when hard-cooking eggs, if you forget to time them, is
to insert a toothpick or small skewer through egg shell to centre of
yolk. If pick comes out clean, egg is hard-cooked, otherwise sprinkle
hole liberally with salt and continue cooking until done.
