Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
4    Whole cleaned trout, about
-12 oz. each
Vegetable oil
Walnut Butter Sauce or:
Tarragon Cream Sauce
Cooking time is about 15 minutes, so prepare sauce ahead of time.

Prepare grill and briquettes.

Lightly rub outside of fish with vegetable oil. Grill fish on a
well-oiled grid or in a well-oiled wire grill basket, on covered
grill over medium-hot coals 7 minutes per side, or ap- proximately 10
minutes per inch thickness of fish. Test by prod- ding with a fork;
fish should opaque inside.

Serve with either sauce.
