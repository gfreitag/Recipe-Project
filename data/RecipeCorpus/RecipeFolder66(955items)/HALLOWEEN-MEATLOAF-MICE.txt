** First cut 2 coins per mice out of the carrots for ears. Then make
long thin strips out of the remaining carrots for the tails, one for
each mouse. Steam until they are crisp tender. DON'T OVERCOOK!!
Preheat oven to 350F. Mix together the ingredients for the mice
bodies and shape into 4 little mice shaped loafs on baking sheet.
Have them shaped to a point in the front and rounded in the back.
Bake for 45 minutes in preheated oven or until desired doneness. Take
and cut little slits for the ears about 1/3 from the pointed end.
Place the carrot coins in the slits for the ears. Make a tiny slit in
the rounded wide end for the tail and place one of the carrot strips
in the slit for the tail. Use the raisins for the eyes. Break the
uncooked spaghetti noodles into pieces and place around the "nose"
(pointed end) for whiskers. Heat the spaghetti sauce. Place a large
spoonful of sauce on a plate. Place a meatloaf mouse on top of the
spaghetti sauce to serve.
