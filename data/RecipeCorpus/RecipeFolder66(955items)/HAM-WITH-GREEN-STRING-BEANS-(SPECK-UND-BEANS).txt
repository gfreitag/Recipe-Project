Categories: Penndutch, Ham

*** My notes: I think the recipes in this cookbook all assume using a
whole, uncooked ham. I would omit the step of boiling ham for 3 hours
if using a cooked ham. Cover the piece of ham with cold water and set
over a low flame to cook for 3 hours. Add water from time to time
during cooking in order to have at least one quart of broth at all
times. Wash and clean the string beans, break into small pieces and
add to the ham. Continue cooking about 25 minutes. Pare and quarter
the potatoes; add to the beans and ham and cook about 25 or 30
minutes, or until beans and potatoes are tender. About 15 minutes
before serving, add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot, providing
vinegar for those who like the dish strongly flavored. Source:
