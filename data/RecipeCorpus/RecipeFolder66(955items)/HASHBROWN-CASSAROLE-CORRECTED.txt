Categories: Casseroles
Yield: 10 Servings
1/2 lb Southern Hash Browns
-(Diced-Style)
1/8    Cup    Soft butter
1/4    Cup    Cream of Chicken Soup
3 oz Chedder; grated
2 oz Sour cream
1/4    Salt
1/4    Tsp.   Onion; chopped
1/2    Cup    Cornflakes; crushed
1/4    STICK butter
Line 13X9 pan with potatoes.  Mix next 6 well.  Spoon over potatoes.
Top with flakes. Use vegetable peeler to slice stick butter over the
top , covering as much as you can. Bake at 350 for 50 min. Really
need to use a bigger pan as it usually runs over, but this is the
size from the original recipe.  This is very richer and creamy,
everyone loves it! reposted by Sarah Gruenwald 12/96
