Tricornered hat-shaped hamantaschen, filled with dried fruit, poppy
seeds or jam, are a traditional treat during PURIM, one of the
liveliest of the Jewish holidays. Try our prune filled version for a
sweet taste of the festivities on March 19.

In large bowl, beat together butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in
honey, vanilla and eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
addition. Combine flour with baking powder; gradually stir into
butter mixture. Press gently into ball; wrap and refrigerate for at
least 2 hours or up to 3 days. FILLING: In food processor, finely
chop together prunes, raisins,walnuts, lemon rind and juice, and
sugar. On floured surface, roll out one-quarter of the dough at a
time to 1/8 inch thickness. Using floured 2-1/2 inch round cutter,
cut out rounds. Place heaping teaspoonful of filling in center of
each. Fold three sides up to make three corners;pinch each corner to
seal. Reroll scraps once. Place on greased baking sheets; brush egg
over edges.  Bake in 350 F oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden.
Let cool on racks. Makes about 5 dozen.
