Title: HAGGIS (BRAD)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Sheep's paunch
Heart,lung,liver of sheep
Salt
White pepper
Hot red pepper
-(cayenne preferred)
1 lb Beef suet
1/8 ts Nutmeg
2    Onions, chopped
6 oz Oatmeal, toasted
3/4 pt Beef stock
Clean the paunch thoroughly and then turn it inside out.

Boil the lung, liver and heart until tender.  While you are doing
this, put the windpipe over the edge of the pot, draining into
another receptacle. Chop the meat extremely fine; grate the liver.
Mix the meats with the spices, onions, suet and oatmeal.  Mix in the
stock and then stuff into the paunch.

NOTE:  the oatmeal will enlarge as it absorbs the liquid, so leave
extra room.  Sew the paunch up and then prick it with a needle. Boil
in water for 3 hours.

To reheat, wrap in foil and bake in the over for around 2 hours;
since it paunch could break, this will save the filling! --
