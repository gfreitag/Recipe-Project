Yield: 8 Servings
1 lb Ground Beef
1/4 c  Onion; Chopped, 1 sm.
8 oz Canned Vegetables; 1 cn, *
1 c  Cheese; Shredded, (4 oz), **
1/4 c  Catsup

~----------------- Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cook and stir the
meat and onion in a large skillet until the meat is brown. Drain off
the excess fat. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining
ingredients except the pie crust mix and set aside. Prepare the
pastry as for a 2 crust pie as directed on the package. Divide the
pastry into 8 equal parts. Roll each part, on a lightly floured
surface, into a 7-inch circle. On half of the circle, spread about
1/4 cup of the meat mixture (packed) to within 1/2-inch of the edge.
Moisten the edge of the pastry with water and fold over the meat
mixture, sealing the edges with a fork. Place on an ungreased baking
sheet and prick the tops with the fork. Bake 30 to 35 minutes. You
can serve these as sandwiches or, if you prefer, place on a plate and
top with gravy or sauce. NOTE: You can substitute 1 cup of your
favorite cooked vegetable for the peas or carrots in this recipe.
