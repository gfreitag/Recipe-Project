Recipe by: Jo Merrill, Sunset All-Time Favorite Recipes
In a 2-quart saucepan, combine soy sauce, sugar, sake and fresh
ginger slices. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved,
then boil until reduced to 1/3 cup. Discard ginger slices and keep
sauce warm. Rinse fish (which has been cut into 4 equal portions),
pat dry and brush lightly with oil. Place fish on grill about 6
inches above a solid bed of hot coals. Cook, turning once, just until
browned on outside but still pale pink in center; cut to test (3-4
minutes). To serve, place each piece of fish on a plate. Arrange 3
papaya slices each piece of fish; then top each serving equally with
soy-ginger sauce and candied ginger. Garnish with julienned bell
peppers. Recipe from Sunset All-Time Favorite Recipes book.
