Title: HAMBURGER PETAL PIE
Categories: Meats
Yield: 5 Servings
1 c  Onion, chopped
1 c  Green pepper, chopped
1/2    Garlic clove, crushed
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 1/2 lb Hamburger
1/3 c  Water
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
2 tb Flour
1    Egg, slightly beaten
1 lb Biscuits, canned
Saute the onion, green pepper and garlic in the oil until tender then
add the beef and cook until brown all over. Dump out the grease and
add about 1/3 cup of water. Add the worchestershire sauce, salt,
pepper and flour. Simmer until the juice thickens.

Separate the biscuits and brush the edges with the egg. Put the
biscuits against the sides and bottom of a pie plate so it is
completely covered.

Stir the rest of the egg into the meat mixture and then spoon the
meat into the pie shell.  If you wish you can garnish with a few
tomato wedges. Bake in a pre-heated oven at 450 degrees F. for about
8 to 10 minutes. The biscuits should be slightly browned.

NOTES:

*  A quick hamburger dish -- I got this recipe from Judy Halter who
got it from her sister.  Yield: serves 5.

*  This gets its name because the biscuits around the edge puff up to
look like the petals around the center of a sunflower. This is a
great bachelor meal because you can come in from work and make it
without much effort, time or dish washing. You can play with
different spices to change the flavor. Some of my friends like to put
cheese on top before baking it.

*  If you live outside North America, remember that a biscuit is a
scone.
