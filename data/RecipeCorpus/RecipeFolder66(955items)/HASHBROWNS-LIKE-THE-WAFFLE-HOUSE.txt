while they are browning, dice and saute a little fresh onion in a bit
of olive oil and a dab of butter until onions are limp. OR Micro WARM
a small jar of Cheez Whiz per label directions. OR dice up some
boiled ham. OR warm up a can of Campbell's Chili Beef Soup, diluted
just to spooningconsistency with a little V-8 juice. OR dice up some
fresh tomato. OR for extra crispy, pat down with back of spatula in
extra oil or butter until browned to your liking. OR for "steamed",
add a few spoons of water just around edge of browning potatoes and
put a lid on them to let them "steam" a few minutes until soft.
