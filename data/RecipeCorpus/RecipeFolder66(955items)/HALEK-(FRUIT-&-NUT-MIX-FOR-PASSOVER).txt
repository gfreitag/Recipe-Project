Jewish, Pileggi, Persia
1/4 c  Almonds
1/4 c  Pistachio nuts
1/4 c  Walnuts
1/4 c  Pumpkin seeds
1/4 c  Hazelnuts
1/8 c  Pitted dates, coarsely Chopped
1/8 c  Light and dark raisins
1/8 c  Dried apricots, coarsely Chopped
1/8 c  Prunes, chopped
1/8 c  Aloo bukhara (dried apricots With seeds)
1/8 c  Dried seeded cherries, Coarsely chopped
1/4 c  Red wine
2 t  Wine vinegar
1/4 t  Advieh; see recipe
1/4 t  Rosewater

1.  Coarsely chop the nuts in a processor.  Mix the nuts, fruits,
wine, vinegar, Advieh, and rosewater to achieve a moist, textured
consistency.

VARIATIONS:  For fresh fruit halek, use apples, pears, pineapples,
plums, and grapes -- as much variety as is available -- an equal
amount of each when cut into very small pieces. Mix with the wine,
vinegar, Advieh, and rosewater in the proportions noted for the dried
fruit and nuts.

Halek is a word also used in Kurdistan and India to denote the
ceremonial mixture presented on the table at the Passover Seder. The
Ashkenazi haroseth is used for the same purpose, but the combination
of ingredients is more complex. There are several types of Persian
halek -- the combination of nuts, fruits, wine, and spices --
depending upon the family custom.
