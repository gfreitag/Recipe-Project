Title: HAYMAKER'S SWITCHEL
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Brown sugar
1/2 ts Ginger
1/2 c  Molasses
3/4 c  Vinegar
2 qt Water
In haying season, farmers used to take their "nooning" (midday
dinner) with them, including a jug of Switchel to wash the meal down.
Although Switchel was usually straight, farmers have been known to
spike it with hard cider, or even brandy which Down easters usd to
say, "got the hay in the barn in half the time." Mix together, add
ice and chill.
