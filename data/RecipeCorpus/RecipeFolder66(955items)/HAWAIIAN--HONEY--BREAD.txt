Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
4    4 1/2 c. all purpose flour
2 pk Quick rise yeast
1/3 c  Non-fat dry milk solids
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Pineapple juice
1/2 c  Water
1/3 c  Shortening
1/4 c  Honey
2    Eggs
1 dr Yellow food coloring
(optional)
1    Egg, slightly beaten
1 tb Water
In large mixer bowl, combine 2 1/4 cups flour, yeast, dry milk and
salt; mix well. In saucepan, heat pineapple juice, 1/2 cup water,
shortening and honey until warm (120-130 degrees); shortening does
not need to melt. Add to flour mixture. Add 2 eggs and food coloring.
Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed.
By hand, gradually stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft
dough. Knead on floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5
minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let
rise in warm place about 15 minutes. Punch down dough.  On lightly
floured surface, shape into a round loaf. Place in greased 9" or 10"
pie pan. Cover; let rise in warm place about 15 minutes. Combine egg
and 1 tablespoon water; brush loaf. Bake at 375 degrees for 35 to 40
minutes until golden brown. Remove from pan; cool.
