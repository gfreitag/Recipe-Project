If you have bought uncleaned squid, clean it as follows:

Remove the head with the tentacles from the body. Peel the thin outer
membraned from the body.  Pull the inner cartilage from the body
(This is a single piece that looks like plastic). Discard but save
the body. Cut the tentacles off below the eye and remove the hard
pebble-like sphere that remains inside the tentacles. Reserve the
tentacles. Wash the body thoroughly.  It should remain in a bag shape
after washing.

Rub the squid with the sesame oil and salt and pepper to taste. Set
aside while you prepare the slaw.

See Asian Slaw for recipe.
