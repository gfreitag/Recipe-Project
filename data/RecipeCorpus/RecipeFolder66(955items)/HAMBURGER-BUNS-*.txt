Add ingredients to machine in order given by manufacturer. Select
dough/manual cycle. When cycle is complete, remove dough from machine
to lightly floured surface. If needed, knead in enough flour to make
dough easy to handle. If dough is too elastic, cover and let rest 10
minutes before shaping. Divide dough into 9 equal pieces. Form each
into a smooth ball. Place on large greased baking sheet. Flatten
balls into 4" rounds; cover. Let rise in warm, draft free place until
doubled in size, about 20-30 minutes. Lightly beat egg white and
water. Brush on buns. Sprinkle with sesame seed. Bake at 375~ for
12-15 minutes or until done.

about 6-1/2" long, tapering ends. Continue as above.
