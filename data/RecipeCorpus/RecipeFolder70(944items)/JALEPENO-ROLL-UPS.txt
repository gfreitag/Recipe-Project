Recipe by: JFULLER@UGA.CC.UGA.EDU (Jenna) In a bowl combine cream
cheese, sour cream, peppers and taco sauce until blended. Lay a
tortilla out flat and spread a thin layer of cream cheese mixture on
it. Then, tightly roll up tortilla (like a jelly roll). Wrap in Saran
wrap and refrigerate from 24 hours to 4 days. Repeat with remaining
tortillas. After refrigeration, unwrap rolls and slice in about 1/4 "
thick slices. Serve on a platter with parsley or Boston lettuce and
can be served with salsa for dipping. This recipe makes about 80-100
slices.

***TIP: Cut with a very sharp knife
