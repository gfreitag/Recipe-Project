go on top of beef patty.

In 1950 a man named Robert O'Petersen built the first Jack-In-The-Box
restaurant at El Cahon and 63rd streets in San Diego. The restaurant
was origanally built for drive-thru and walk-up service
only--customers would speak into a clown's mouth to order their food.
The clown was blasted to smithereens with explosives in a 1980
advertising campaign, however, signifying a shift toward a more
diverse adult menu.
The Jumbo Jack hamburger has been on the menu since 1974.
