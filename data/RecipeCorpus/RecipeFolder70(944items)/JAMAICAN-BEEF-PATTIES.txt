MMMMM------------------------MEAT FILLING-----------------------------
2 tb Margarine
1    Small white onion,

1/4 ts Chopped Scotch Bonnet pepper
1/2 lb Lean ground beef
1/2 ts Salt

1/4 c  Breadcrumbs
1/4 c  Beef or chicken stock

Note: Scotch Bonnet pepper is a very hot pepper native to Jamaica and
the Caribbean islands. Try to find it at your area's West Indian
grocery stores, or use jalapenos as a substitute. Also known as
habinera peppers. 1. Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Cut
in the shortening and margarine until crumbly. Add the cold water to
make a stiff dough. Lightly flour a wooden cutting board and roll out
the dough until about 1/8 inch thick. Cut out 8 inch circles. Cover
with wax paper or damp cloth until ready to use. 2. In a heavy
skillet, melt the margarine and saute the onion and Scotch Bonnet
Pepper until they become limp. Add the ground beef, salt, pepper,
curry powder and thyme and mix well. Brown the meat for about 10
minutes, stirring occasionaly. 3. Add the breadcrumbs and stock and
combine all the ingredients well. Cover the skillet and simmer for
about 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. When all the liquids
have been absorbed, the filling is ready. It should be moist but not
watery. Remove the skillet from the stove and preheat oven to 400
degrees F. 4. Uncover the dough circles and place 2 to 3 tablespoons
of filling on halfof each. Moisten the edges of the dough with water
and fold the dough circle over the meat filling. Pinch the edges
closed with a fork. Lightly brush the pastry with a mixture of the
egg and water. Bake on a lightly greased baking sheet for 30 to 40
minutes or until the pastry is golden brown. Yield: 10 patties.
