Title: ITALIAN TRAY 2
Categories: Salads, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
(No Ingredients)
(CONTINUED FROM PART ONE)

Salami, Polish ham, or other cold cuts can be cut into halves or
triangles. If you want to go fancy, soften cream cheese, fill and
roll up a slice of meat. Secure with a toothpick and green olive.

Cherry tomatoes can be left whole and beautiful or you can cut off
the very top of them and scoop out the insides. Then fill with tuna
or deviled ham salad mix. For the added zing, use a little bit of
horseradish in the tuna or ham.  Dust the tops with parsley.

Olives, black and green, and green onions complete the tray. (You
might want to top the whole tray off with little pieces of ice here
and there to keep it all fresh and delicious.) YIELD: Depends on cold
cuts and vegetables in the Italian Tray.
