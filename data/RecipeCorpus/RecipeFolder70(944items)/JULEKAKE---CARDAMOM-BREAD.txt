Categories: Breads, Norwegian
Yield: 2 Servings
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 pk Active dry yeast
3/4 ts Ground cardamom
1 1/4 c  Milk
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Butter
1 ts Salt
1    Egg
1 c  Candied fruits; optional
1 c  Light raisins
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
In a large mixer bowl combine 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, yeast, and
cardamom.  In a saucepan heat milk, sugar, butter, and salt just till
warm (115F) and the butter is almost melted; stir constantly. Add
heated milk mixture to flour mixture; add 1 egg.  Beat at low speed
of electric mixer for 1/2 minute.  Beat 3 minutes at high speed,
scraping sides of bowl constantly.  Stir in 1 chopped mixed candied
fruits and peels (optional), raisins, and as much of the 2 1/2 cups
all-purpose flour as you can mix in with a spoon. Turn out onto a
lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining all-purpose
flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6
to 8 minutes total). Shape dough into a ball. Place in a lightly
greased bowl; turn once to grease surface. Cover, let rise in a warm
place till double (about 1 1/2 hours). Punch dough down; divide dough
in half. Cover; let rest 10 minutes. Shape into 2 round loaves; place
on greased baking sheets. Flatten each slightly to a 6-inch diameter.
Cover; let rise till nearly double (45 to 60 minutes). Stir together
1 slightly beaten egg yolk and 2 tablespoons water, brush over loaves.
Bake in a 350F oven for 35 minutes or till done.
Cool on a wire rack.  Makes 2 round loaves.
