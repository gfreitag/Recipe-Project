Title: JOE'S SOAK SAUCE
Categories: Sauce
Yield: 3 Cups
4    Dried New Mexico red chilies
4    Dried chipotle chilies
1    To 2 fresh habanero or
Scotch bonnet chilies,
Stemmed and seeded
2    To 6 medium garlic cloves,
Peeled and coarsely chopped
1/4 c  Coarsely chopped onions
1/3 c  Loosely packed fresh
Rosemary
1 ts Coarse sea salt
1/4 c  Bourbon, or 3 tablespoons
Brown sugar
2 c  Red wine vinegar
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1. Stem and seed the dried chilies.  Place in a skillet and put into a
preheated 250-degree oven for about 4 minutes, until they become
fragrant. Shake once during the roasting time. Remove from oven and
put in just enough hot water (water just below the boiling point) to
cover then put a small plate on top to submerge the chilies. Let soak
20 to 30 minutes, until softened. 2. Drain the chilies and chop
coarsely. Put into a food processor or blender with the fresh
chilies, garlic according to taste, onions, rosemary, salt, bourbon
or brown sugar, vinegar and lemon juice. Blend about 3 to 4 minutes,
until very smooth. Pour into a jar, cover and refrigerate. Note: The
sauce can be used to marinate chicken, pork, ribs, or a meaty fish
such as swordfish before grilling.
