Summer time was never a time of ease and leisure. The produce was
ripening in the garden and that meant more canning to do. Relishes
were always a welcome addition to the table during the winter. My
parents never bought comercially prepared pickles, peppers, relishes.
We alway made our own. The Green Tomato Relish would rid the garden
of all the tomatoes that never wanted to ripen. It is a wonderful,
tasty, spicy relish that will accent any meal. Great with sandwiches.
Regards, June Meyer.

Slice thinly only the tomatoes, onions and cauliflower. Place the cut
up vegetables in a large plastic bin. Sprinkle 1 cup of salt over
vegetables and let it sit over night. Drain well and rinse off salt
with water. Remove the seeds from the red and green peppers and cut
up into small pieces. Add the rinsed off vegetables and place in
large kettle or pot along with the vinegar, mustard seeds. Place the
mixed pickling spices in a bag or cloth to keep them together so they
can be fished out later. Mustard seeds remain in the relish. Cook
until vegetable are soft, not mushy! Remove mixed spice bag and add 5
cups of sugar. Cook ten more minutes until sugar is melted. Bottle in
sterilized canning jars. Makes a lot!
