Title: JOYCE'S CINNAMON RAISIN BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
-Joyce Burton
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Canola oil*
1 ts Salt
1 tb Cinnamon
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 1/2 c  Bread flour
1 tb Vital gluten
2 ts Red Star Active Yeast
1 c  Raisins; floured
*I may have used only 1 tablespoon of the oil (can't remember).

Since I like a lighter crust, I made this in my Zoji on the "Basic
White Bread" setting with baking degree set on "Light," instead of on
the "Raisin Bread Setting." I floured the raisins and added them 30
minutes after the kneading started.

I know I had to add additional water, until the dough "looked right,"
but I didn't measure it.  I may have added as much as one-fourth cup.

This made a beautiful loaf....almost to the top of the pan. The next
time I make it, I'll try to remember to write down the amounts!
