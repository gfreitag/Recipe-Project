Title: JICAMA~ ORANGE & FENNEL SALAD
Categories: Salads/dres, Southwester
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Navel oranges
1    Jicama -- size of an apple
1 sm Fennel bulb -- 2" to 3"
Diameter
Arugula
10    Belgian endive leaves or
Handful fresh
Spinach
DRESSING
4 tb Olive oil
2 tb Orange juice
2 tb Balsamic vinegar
2 ts Raspberry vinegar --
Optional
1    Clove garlic -- minced
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Honey
Cut off the ends of the oranges with a sharp serrated knife, then
slice the peel from the sides. With a gentle sawing motion, cut along
each membrane to release the orange sections into a small bowl. Set
aside.

Peel the jicama, and cut into very thin slices about 1-1/2 inches
long. Slice the fennel into very thin strips; include the feathery
tops. Chop the arugula.

In a small bowl, whisk together the dressing ingredients until the
honey is dissolved. Refrigerate everything until serving time.

Assemble the salad on a small platter shortly before serving. First,
put down a layer of endive or spinach (a starburst pattern looks
nice), then a layer of jicama slices. Drizzle on some of the
dressing, then sprinkle on the fennel and arugula. Arrange orange
sections on top, and spoon on a little more dressing. Garnish with
some red onion slices if desired.
