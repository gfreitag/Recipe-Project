Title: JEFF'S FAVORITE BARBECUE BRISKET
Categories: Bar-b-q, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
6 lb Beef brisket
Smoker for cooking
10 lb Charcoal
1/4 lb Mesquite wood
Basting sauce
Barbecue sauce
This is a perfect way to spend a day, and makes a meal fit for a king!

It really takes a smoker to make this successfully, but creative
folks can use whatever's handy.

Select a good quality beef brisket.  Trim off excess fat and store in
refrigerator until ready to barbecue.

If you wish, marinade the meat for additional flavor or tenderness. A
good marinade can consist of water, Worcestershire Sauce, Soy Sauce,
pepper, lime or lemon juice - whatever you like! (No Salt, though)

Start 8 lbs. of the charcoal and allow coals to develop gray ash over
all before beginning to cook. Reserve the remaining 2 lbs. for adding
when needed later. Add wood that has been soaking in water for an
hour or so.

Cook the meat on a grate approx. 8 inches over the coals, adding
charcoal and wood to fire as needed.  It isn't necessary to keep a
heavy smoke at all times, just 1/2 of the cooking time. Use a meat
thermometer to determine doneness of meat to your preference.  If the
smoker has an indicator for temperature, a low heat is fine. Coals
and wood tend to burn at lower temperatures when enclosed in a smoker.

While cooking, it is essential to baste often with the basting
sauce. Usually every 10 minutes or even less will ensure a juicy and
delicious brisket.

If basting with another sauce, remember that anything containing
sugar or tomato will burn, leaving a scorched flavor. That's
especially true with meats cooked over long periods of time.

Serve with the warmed barbecue sauce and breads, beans, salad or
potatoes.

Enjoy!    Jeff Duke
