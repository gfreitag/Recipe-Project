Title: JANSSON'S FRESTELSE (JANSSON'S TEMPTATION) -
Categories: Swedish, Seafood, Side dish, Casseroles
Yield: 4 Servings
7 md Boiling potatoes; peeled &
-cut into 2" X 1/4" strips
2 1/2 tb Butter
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 lg (to 3) yellow onions; thinly
-sliced (4 cups)
16    Flat anchovy fillets;drained
White pepper
2 tb Fine dry bread crumbs
2 tb Butter; cut into 1/4" bits
1 c  Heavy cream
1/2 c  Milk
Preheat oven to 400øF.  Place the potato strips in cold water to keep
them from discoloring. Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons
of oil in a 10-12" skillet; when the foam subsides, add the onions
and cook 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until they are soft but not
brown.

With a pastry brush or paper towels, spread a 1 1/2 to 2-quart
souffl or baking dish with the remaining half tablespoon of butter.
Drain the potatoes and pat them dry with paper towels. Arrange a
layer of potatoes on the bottom of the dish and then alternate layers
of onions and anchovies ending with potatoes. Sprinkle each layer
with a little white pepper. Scatter bread crumbs over the top layer
of potatoes and dot the casserole with the 2 tablespoons of butter
cut into bits. In a small saucepan, heat the milk and cream until it
barely simmers, then pour over potatoes.

Bake in the center of the oven for 45 minutes or until the potatoes
are tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife or skewer and
the liquid is nearly absorbed.

.\\ichele's notes: I hate anchovies. With a passion. But this is one
of the best dishes I ever had. The cream and milk leech the salty
anchovy taste right out and it turns into what can only be described
as heaven. A definite Swedish Christmas staple at our house!
