Soak the pig's tail overnight in fresh water to cover. Then thoroughly
rinse the pig's tail (or ham hocks) in cold water. Combine in a large
heavy sauce- pan with the beef, dried kidney beans (if using canned
beans don't add at this time), and the water. Cover and cook over
medium heat for about 1 hour, until the meat and beans are tender.
Add the potatoes, coconut milk, and any other peeled root vegetables
or dumplings along with the onion, scallions, thyme and hot pepper.

the soup and allow to simmer for 1 hour. Remove the whole hot pepper
and thyme sprig before serving. Serve hot. This is even better served
the second day.
