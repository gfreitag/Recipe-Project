Title: JACK DANIEL'S TENNESSEE WHISKEY CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Sauces
Yield: 4 Servings
2    FRYING CHICKENS (2 lbs each)
1 c  JACK DANIEL'S WHISKEY
SALT to taste
BLACK PEPPER to taste
MMMMM-----------------------WHISKEY SAUCE----------------------------
1 lb WHITE MUSHROOMS; sliced
6    GREEN ONIONS; chopped
2 tb BUTTER
2 oz JACK DANIEL'S WHISKEY
2 c  BROWN SAUCE*
Have the butcher split two small fryers or if you prefer, buy cut-up
chicken pieces. Place the chicken in a shallow pan and douse with
whiskey. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the pieces; marinate for 2
hours. Soak some wood chips (they specify Jack Daniel's Barrel chips)
in water--if you're using regular wood chips, I'd suggest soaking
them in whiskey? While the chips are soaking, build a charcoal fire
in your barbecue grill. Use the wood chips in your grill to create a
good smoking fire. Broil the fryvers over the pit until well cooked.
Serve with whiskey sauce. FOR WHISKEY SAUCE: Saute the mushrooms and
green onion in butter until tender. Add whiskey and brown sauce and
simmer until flavors have blended and the alcohol has evaporated.
Keep warm until serving time. * BROWN SAUCE - To make Brown Sauce;
thicken beef bouillon with cornstarch or roux. Or better yet, make it
from scratch.
