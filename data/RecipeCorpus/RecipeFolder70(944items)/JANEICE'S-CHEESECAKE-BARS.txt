MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 c  Butter; softened
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
2 c  Flour; sifted (I never sift)
MMMMM--------------------CREAM CHEESE TOPPING-------------------------
2 pk 8 oz. cream cheese; softened
2    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Powdered sugar
1 c  Sour cream
Crust: Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in
vanilla. Gradually beat in flour and mix well. Pat dough evenly over
bottom of ungreased jelly roll pan. Bake at 350 for 20 minutes until
LIGHTLY browned. Cool.
Cream Cheese Topping: Beat cream cheese until smooth. Add eggs and
vanilla and beat until smooth. Stir in sugar. FOLD in sour cream.
Spread over cooled crust. Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes. Cool before
cutting. (I think it's easier to cut them when still warm.)
