Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
1 ts Paprika
1 ts Onion powder
1 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts White pepper
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Ground ancho pepper
1 lb Chicken breast, diced
8 oz Polish turkey kielbasa,diced
1 c  Chopped red pepper
1 c  Chopped celery
1 c  Chopped onion
8 c  Chicken stock
1/2 c  Oil (for roux)
1/2 c  Flour (for roux)
2 c  Long-grain rice
8 oz Fresh sliced mushrooms
2 tb Oil (for saute veggies)
Mix all seasonings, set aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Coat
chicken with one tablespoon of seasoning mix. Put in baking pan and
bake for 15 min. Set aside. Slice and parboil the sausage to rid it
of excess salt. Drain water, set sausage aside. In a 5 qt. pot, add
onions, red peppers,2 cups chicken stock, mushrooms, celery, and the
remaining spice mix with 2 tablespoons of oil. Saute till limp. While
veggies are sauteing, make the roux. Mix flour with equal amount of
oil in a PYREX! container. Mix and put in microwave oven for 4 min on
high. After that, remove and stir and put back for 1 min intervals
stirring each time, till the roux is dark enough. Be very careful.
This shit gets upwards of 500 degrees! Roux should be about the color
of light chocolate. When veggies are limp, add the rest of the
chicken stock, chicken and sausage. Bring to a simmer. Add roux.
Simmer for 30 min. While this is happening, start the rice.

Serve in a bowl, over rice. Add file powder to taste on an individual
basis.
