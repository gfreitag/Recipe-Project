Every Family has their version of Sour Cherry Soup. It is a special
seasonal treat in Hungary when the cherries are ripe. Sour Cherries
have a wonderful flavor when cooked. Some families like to make their
soup with sweet cream instead of sour cream. Some add a little
sherry. How ever you make this soup, you will enjoy its refreshing
flavor. Regards, June Meyer.

Into a soup pot containing 1 1/2 quarts of boiling water add fresh or
frozen sour cherries and granulated sugar. Stir and cook. In a
separate bowl mix flour, sour cream, salt and beat until smooth. Add
to flour mix, 1 cup of hot cherry sugar mix. Stir vigorously. Now add
the flour, sour cream and hot cherry mix into the pot of hot soup,
stir well and simmer for 5 or 6 minutes until it thickens. Cover the
soup and let cool. Keep cover on while it chills in refrigerator and
it will not form a thick skin. Serve very cold.

Note: to make Cherry Soup with Sweet Cream or Meggy Leves Mas Modon
Cook a 1 inch stick of cinnamon with the cherries, and substitute
sweet cream for the sour cream. Discard cinnamon stick when done
cooking soup. Chill as above.  WALT
