I can't be too sure that this recipe is an old recipe since it relies
on refrigeration to keep it for 3 or 4 months. But I do know that we
used this recipe at the end of summer when the cucumbers were
plentiful and we stocked our crock for a winter of relish. Regards,
June Meyer.

Mix all in a bowl and let sit for 3 hours. After 3 hours, pour off
excess liquid. Add 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of white vinegar. Mix
and store in covered glass jar or dish in refrigerator. Will keep up
to 3 or 4 months. WALT
