Title: JAPANESE ROSY PICKLED GINGER (GARI)
Categories: Low, Fat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Unpeeled baby ginger (in
Oriental groceries) or
Peeled regular ginger
(Note: regular ginger tends
To be stronger and tougher,
But works
Quite well anyway)
Peel (if necessary), rinse,
And pat dry.
Put in a bowl and coat with
About a heaping tablespoon
Salt
(preferably the pickling
Variety)
-
(24 hours later:)
1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  Rice vinegar (unseasoned
Light)
1 c  Less 2 tablespoons water
Set in a cool place for 24
Hours
Dissolve sugar in rice vinegar and water.  Put into a 6-cup resealable
glass jar (I use the kind with the lever-action wire closure and
rubber seal ring). Rinse the salt off the ginger and pat dry. Put
ginger into vinegar/sugar solution.  Close jar and refrigerate at
least a week.

The vinegar will turn the ginger a rosy pink.  Just before serving,
slice thinly with the grain.

You can keep a jar of this going indefinitely by replenishing the
ginger and vinegar/sugar solution as it is used.
