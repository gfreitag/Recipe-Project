Title: JUNE MEYER'S AUTHENTIC HUNGARIAN FARINA DUMPL
Categories: Dumpling, Hungary
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Butter
2    Eggs
Farina
1/4 ts Salt
Every ethnic cuisine has it's own way of economically stretching a
meal. For eastern Europeans the dumpling is king. Every goulash,
every soup, every paprikas, every sauerkraut and even desserts had
its own particular type of dumpling. Soft, spongy, chewy, al dente,
silky, what ever your desire. Farina dumplings are firmer to the bite
than the flour kind. They are a wonderful addition to a chicken, beef
or tomato soup. Very easy to make. This is my mother's recipe.
Regards, June Meyer.

Mix the soft butter,salt and the 2 eggs well. Add farina 1/4 cup at a
time till you have a dumpling dough consistency. Then add a little
soup for moisture. When the soup boils, cut the dumplings into the
soup with a teaspoon. When they come to the top, cook about 5 minutes
more. Serves 4.
