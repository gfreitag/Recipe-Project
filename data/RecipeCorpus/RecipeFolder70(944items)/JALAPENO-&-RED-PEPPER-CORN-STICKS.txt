**Blue cornmeal is available in Mexican specialty stores and the
ethnic department of major supermarkets. Blue cornmeal originated in
Santa Fe, New Mexico, where the dark exotic corn is a staple. Blue
cornmeal is coarser, heavier, and nuttier tasting than yellow
cornmeal. One may be substituted for the other quite easily. Using a
cast-iron corn or muffin pan produces a delicious crunchy crust. The
chile adds bite, while the sweet, mild bell pepper adds color.
Preheat oven to 425F. Liberally grease a corn stick pan with the
vegetable oil. In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, salt,
sugar, and baking powder. In a small separate bowl, beat the eggs
with the milk. Make a well in the dry ingredients and add the wet
ingredients all at once. Stir just to combine, the batter will be
lumpy. Gently fold in the peppers and butter. Fill the molds almost
to the top with the batter and bake 20 minutes. Serve warm with lots
of butter.
