This is not the traditional Chinese version, but this slightly
sweeter dish is the way you'll find it in this country.

CUT PORK INTO 1-INCH cubes; put into a bowl with the rice wine or
sherry, soy sauce and salt. Marinate for 20 minutes. Cut the green
and red peppers into 1-inch squares. Peel and cut the carrot and
scallions into 1-inch chunks. Bring a pot of water to a boil and
blanch the carrot in it for 4 minutes; drain and set aside. Mix the
egg and cornstarch in a bowl until they are well blended into a
batter. Lift the pork cubes out of the marinade, put them into the
batter and coat each piece well. Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer or
large wok until it is almost smoking. Remove the pork pieces from the
batter with a slotted spoon, and deep-fry them. Drain the deep-fried
pork cubes on paper towels. Combine the chicken stock, soy sauce,
salt, vinegar, sugar and tomato paste in a large saucepan. Bring it
to a boil. Add all the vegetables, but not the lychees or oranges,
and stir well. In a small bowl, blend together the cornstarch and
water. Stir this mixture into the sauce and bring it back to a boil.
Turn the heat down to a simmer. Add lychees or oranges and pork
cubes. Mix well, and then turn the mixture onto a platter. Serve at
once.
