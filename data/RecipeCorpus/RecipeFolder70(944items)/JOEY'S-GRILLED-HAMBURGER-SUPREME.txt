Title: JOEY'S GRILLED HAMBURGER SUPREME
Categories: Barbeque, Hamburgers, Beef
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Ground Round
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts White pepper
1/2 ts Garlic powder
3 tb Cajun Power Garlic Sauce
1 tb Worcestershire Sauce
1/2 ts Black Pepper
4 tb Italian Bread Crumbs
1 ts Old Bay Seasoning
1 cn Mushrooms
4 tb BUTTER
1/2 ts Onion Powder
Saute mushrooms in 1/2 stick of butter. Mix ground beef with spices
thoroughly. Fashion into thin patties (1/4"); 5 inches in diameter as
they will shrink and get "thicker" after grilling. Grill until
desired doneness. Garnish with mushrooms, tomatoes, SHARP cheddar
cheese and lettuce. Serve on an Onion roll. Purple onion slices are
optional for those who enjoy that sweet onion. Hamburgers tend to get
a little boring but this will change your mind about the traditional
burger. NOTE: This is not a "HOT" burger, so stay with the spices. It
is a little extra trouble with all the ingredients but it is relished
by my family. Hope yours enjoy it too. Joey Aguzin in New Awlins.
