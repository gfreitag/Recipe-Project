4 TB olive oil
1 TB Paul Prudhomme's Vegetable

Pre-heat the oven to 250 degrees. Slice pork into 4 equal pieces,
place each piece between sheets of plastic wrap and pound thin. Rub
the mushrooms with roasted garlic, some of the olive oil and season
with Vegetable Magic and the Pork and Veal Magic. Rub the pork with
the wet jerk seasoning, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the dry jerk
seasoning, and then dip the pork into a dish of the remaining olive
oil.

Heat a large saute pan until almost smoking, lay the slices of pork
in the pan and sear about 40 seconds on each side. Remove the pork to
an oven proof dish. Add the mushrooms to the saute pan and saute them
about 1 minute per side, or until softened. Then put the mushrooms in
the dish with the pork and keep them warm in the oven.

In the same saute pan pour the cream and add the coriander, allspice,
the remaining dry jerk seasoning, and the Worcestershire sauce.
Reduce until the sauce thickens and then stir in the butter. Season
with salt, if necessary.

Put 1/4 of the rice on each serving plate, put a slice of pork on the
rice, top with a mushroom and spoon the sauce over the top. Scatter
the green onions over the plate as garnish.
