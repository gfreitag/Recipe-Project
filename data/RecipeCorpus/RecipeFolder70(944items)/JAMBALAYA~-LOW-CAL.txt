Title: JAMBALAYA~ LOW CAL
Categories: Rice, Low-cal
Yield: 2 Servings
1/2 c  Onion - chopped
1/4 c  Green pepper - chopped
1/2 c  Tomato - chopped
2    Clove garlic - minced
1    Bay leaf
1/4 ts Thyme
2 ts Parsley - fresh, minced
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
-Pinch cayenne
1 c  Chicken stock - made without
-salt or fat
1/2 c  Rice - uncooked
2 oz Chicken - lean, cubed,
-cooked or raw
Heat a saucepan and add the onion and bell pepper. Using a wooden
spoon, stir them over medium heat until they begin to color while you
scrape the sides and bottom of the pan to be sure that nothing sticks
and burns. Add the tomato, garlic, herbs and seasonings and stir
together. Add the stock and bring to a boil. Add the rice and chicken
and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer gently for 20 minutes, then
uncover and let the Jambalaya dry out a bit. Fluff up the Jambalaya
with a fork and serve.

NOTES: Different rices will vary this dish. Experiment. It is not
necessary that each grain be separate. Jambalaya, by the nature of
its cooking process, may be somewhat sticky and perhaps the better
dish for it.

VARIATION: Jambalaya can be made with shrimp, lean turkey sausage,
smoked chicken or smoked turkey.  Just remember to keep it light.
