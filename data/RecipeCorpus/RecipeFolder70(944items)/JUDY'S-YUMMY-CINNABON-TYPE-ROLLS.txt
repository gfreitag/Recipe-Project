To make Cinnabons in the bread machine use the dough setting. Remove
from the Bread machine. FILLING: Spread dougn with the softened
margerine and sprinkle evenly with the brown sugar/cinnamon and roll
with a rolling pin. Roll up jelly roll fashion and cut sharp with a
knife into 12 rolls, about 2" thick. Place rolls in a greased 9 x 13
pan - 3 rows of 4 rolls each. You can bake them right away without a
second rise (yes, that's right) but I like to lwt them rise about 15
minutes in a warm spot, ten bake them in a 400~ oven for about 13-14
minutes. While they're hot from the oven, spread them gently with a
little of the icing. Add more icing after 5 to 10 minutes. NOTE:
After placing them in the pan, you can cover them and refrigerate or
you can freeze them for up to a month. Before baking allow them to
come to room temperature, then let rise for 15 minutes in a warm spot
and bake as directed above.
