Title: JUNE MEYER'S AUTHENTIC HUNGARIAN SMOKED BUTT
Categories: Hungary, Pork
Yield: 8 Servings
3 lb Smoked pork butt
3 tb Brown sugar
2 qt Water
Smoked butt made in the Austrian-Hungarian style is wonderful and
economical eating. The butt is cooked in brown sugar water. I find
that the smoked butt is small enough to last for a few meals. It
usually weighs about 3 to 4 pounds, is not full of fat. If you have
not tried a smoked butt, you will be in for a surprise. It has very
good smoked ham flavor. It makes a wonderful "corned beef and
cabbage" meal for Saint Patrick's Day, but cooks much faster than
corned beef. Only 40 minutes a pound and it is done, versus hours for
corned beef. No fatty waste. Regards, June Meyer. Place Butt in pot
large enough to hold at least 2 quarts of water (enough to cover
butt), add the brown sugar and simmer on top of stove in covered pot,
40 minutes to each pound of butt.

When done, remove butt from pot but do not throw away cooking liquid.
Slice and serve warm with boiled or mashed potatoes and vegetable.
Sour Cream Coleslaw on the side is nice.

The wonderfully flavored cooking water is used to make a delicious
soup, with the addition of cabbage, tomato, onion, potatoes. (See
Sweet and Sour Cabbage Soup recipe).

Smoked butt is versatile and full of tender meat.

NOTE: Hungarian style Sweet and Sour Cabbage Soup takes advantage of
the very flavorful broth or cooking liquid remaining after cooking
butt made in the Austrian-Hungarian style. The butt is cooked in
brown sugar water. (See Smoked Butt Hungarian Style) I usually make
the butt and the Sweet and Sour Cabbage Soup on the same day, but
serve the soup the next day. It is a hearty and filling soup, a
favorite with the children. Regards, June Meyer.
