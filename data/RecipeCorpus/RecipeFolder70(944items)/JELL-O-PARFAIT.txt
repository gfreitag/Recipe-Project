Title: JELL-O PARFAIT
Categories: Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
3 oz Lime Jell-O
3 oz Cherry Jell-O
3 oz Lemon Jell-O
1/2 c  ;Water, boiling
10 oz Pineapple, crushed; juice
-reserved
1/2 pt Sour cream
1/4 c  Pecans; coarsely cut
4 oz Maraschino cherries; drained
Whipped cream
Prepare lime Jell-O according to package instructions; pour into an
8x8 oiled pan.  Refrigerate two hours, or until set. Dissolve the
lemon Jell-O in boiling water. Mix pineapple, sour cream, nuts and
cherries, and add to Jell-O.  Spread carefully on top of congealed
lime Jell-O; refrigerate again until set. Prepare cherry Jell-O, and
quickly cool to room temperature, then pour gently on top of the
lemon layer, being careful not to pour so quickly that the layers
mix. You're trying to achieve a "geological" effect when the parfait
is sliced.

Refrigerate until all layers are set.  Cut into squares and serve
topped with whipped cream.
