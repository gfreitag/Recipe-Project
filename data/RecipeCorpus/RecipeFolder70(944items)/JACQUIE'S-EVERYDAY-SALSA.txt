Title: JACQUIE'S EVERYDAY SALSA
Categories: Mexican, Salsa
4 oz tomatillos
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb tomatoes
1 c  onion -- chopped
1/2 c  green onions -- chopped
1 TB garlic -- minced
1/2 c  canned green chiles
1/2 c  jalapeno chiles, some seeds
removed
:
2 ts ground red chile
1/2 ts ground cumin
1/2 ts salt
1/2 c  minced cilantro
3 TB white wine vinegar

Soak tomatillos in warm water and remove dry husks. Dip tomatoes in
boiling water for 30 sec.  or hold over a gas flame and char. Remove
skins and squeeze out seeds. (I ignored this and just opened a large
can of stewed tomatoes.)

ROUGHLY puree everything. Simmer in an open 2 quart saucepan for 5
minutes to blend flavors and help preserve the salsa. Salsa keeps
well. If you want salsa even hotter, just add more jalapenos or keep
more seeds. (I didn't have jalapenos, so just added some cayenne and
some tabasco to taste. I also found that about a tablespoon of lime
juice was nice.)

Obviously not a gourmet recipe.  But it turned out very nice, and
solves the problem of what to do with the other 90% of the cilantro I
buy every week or two. From: rec.food.cooking -
