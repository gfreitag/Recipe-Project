boiling potatoes (about 2 lbs). Boil in salted water until tender (30
minutes or so?).  Drain and peel. Return to pan and mash over low
heat with a potato masher until no lumps remain. Remove from heat and
mix in 1 egg yolk, lightly beaten, and about a cup of flour. When
well blended, turn onto a floured board and knead in more flour (may
take as much as another cup, probably more like 1/2 cup) until soft
and pliable but not too sticky. Cut in 4 pieces and roll each into a
rope about as thick as your thumb. Cut into 1" lengths. Hold a fork,
tines down, on the board with the curved side away from you.  Roll
each piece against the tines to make the little indentations about
1/2 way round and curve slightly (you really don't have to do this
but it looks cute, and IS authentic). Place on a floured baking sheet
as you do them. You can either cook right away or keep a few hours,
uncovered, in the fridge.  Try this sauce over them: Melt 1 tbsp
butter in a medium pan.  Add 1 clove garlic, very finely minced. Stir
a couple of times and add 1 cup heavy cream. Cook, stirring
constantly, until reduced to about 3/4 cup.  Add 4 oz Gorgonzola and
stir until melted. Now drop the gnocchi into boiling salted water and
cook until they just rise to the top, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove to a
heated platter with a slotted spoon or skimmer as they come up.  Pour
the sauce over them and sprinkle with 1/4 cup chopped toasted walnuts
and serve at once. This is very rich, but WONDERFUL!  Let me know if
this works. Regards from Memphis, Alyce
