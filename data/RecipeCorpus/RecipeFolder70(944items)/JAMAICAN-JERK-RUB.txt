Title: JAMAICAN JERK RUB
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Inner Beauty or
Other Caribbean hot sauce
Or-
10    Pureed Habaneros OR
15    Chile peppers -- pureed
2 tb Dried rosemary
2 tb Chopped parsley
2 tb Dried basil
2 tb Dried thyme
2 tb Mustard seeds
3    Scallions -- finely chopped
1 ts Salt and black pepper
2    Limes -- juice only
1/4 c  Cheap yellow mustard
2 tb Orange juice
2 tb White vinegar
Combine all ingredients in a food processor or blender; blend them
into a paste, making sure that all the ingredients are fully
integrated. The paste should be approximately the consistency of a
thick tomato sauce. If it is too thick, thin it out with a little
more white vinegar. Cover paste and let it sit in the refrigerator
for at least 2 hours for the flavors to blend together. Overnight is
the ideal amount of time to give them to get acquainted. (Note: If
you want to avoid making a fresh batch every time you make this dish,
you can multiply the amount of paste easily. Don't worry about it
going bad, since it keeps almost infinitely). Rub paste on meat and
grill.
