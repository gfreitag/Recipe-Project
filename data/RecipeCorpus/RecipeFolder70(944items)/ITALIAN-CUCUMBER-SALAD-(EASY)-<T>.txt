Title: ITALIAN CUCUMBER SALAD (EASY) <T>
Categories: Low, Fat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg Or two small cucumbers,
Sliced thin
1 sm Or 1/2 large red onion
Red wine vinegar (enough to
Thoroughly soak the above -
I use enough to
*cover*, but then I really
Like red wine vinegar ;)  )
Black pepper (ground) to
Taste
(optional - diced
Pepperoncini, a handful or
So)
Combine everything and chill for at least an hour before serving.
Keeps a while too, with all that vinegar.
