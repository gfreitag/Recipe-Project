Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM-----------------------JALAPENO PASTA----------------------------
2 c  All-Purpose Flour
3/4 c  Semolina flour
5 lg Eggs
1/4 c  Milk
2 ts Jalapenos; pureed
1 ea Pinch salt

2 tb Olive Oil
2 ea Garlic cloves;mashed-minced
2 lb Sea scallops; cleaned
1 tb Fresh cilantro; minced

1 1/2 c  Dry white wine
Jalapeno Pasta: In a large mixing bowl, place all of the ingredients
and knead them with an electric mixer, (or use a dough hook), for 10
minutes, or until a soft dough is formed. On a flat, floured surface,
roll out the dough so that is is 1/8 inch thick. Cut the dough
lengthwise into 1/4 inch wide strips. Hang the strips over a wooden
rod, like a broom handle, for 2 hours (minimum) so that they dry.
Cook the pasta al dente and drain it. Serve it with the Scallop Sauce
on top.

Scallop Sauce: In a large skillet place the olive oil and heat it on
medium high until it's hot. Add the garlic and saute it for 45
seconds, or until it begins to turn brown. Add the sea scallops and
cook them on 1 side for 1 minute. Remove the scallops and place them
on a warm plate. To the skillet add the cilantro, tarragon and white
wine. Cook the ingredients for 5 minutes, or until the sauce is
reduced by half. Add the scallops (place the uncooked sides down in
the pan) and cook them for 4 minutes.
