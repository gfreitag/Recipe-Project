Fat grams    per serving:
round steak, cut in strips about 4 in. long and 1/8 in. thick. (The
slicing is easier if the steak is partially frozen.) Combine all the
ingredients and marinate in the fridge for at least 8 hrs, mixing
occasionally. Then skewer the marinated strips on bamboo skewers or
toothpicks and hang the strips in the oven with a pan below to catch
the drippings. Set the oven on it's lowest setting (l00-150 F) and
use something to keep the door ajar. The jerky should be dry after
8-10 hours. This was my first time making j erky and the product come
out surprizingly good, but perhaps a bit too salty. You might want to
try low salt soy .
