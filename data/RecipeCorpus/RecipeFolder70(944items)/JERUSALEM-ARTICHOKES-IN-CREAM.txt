Categories:
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Jerusalem artichokes --
Boiled
1 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 c  Heavy cream
Salt and black pepper
Artichokes should be boiled until just tender (about 10 m inutes). As
soon as they are just tender, drain and quickly peel them. You may
let tghem cook just enough to handle, but don't let them get cold,
and under no circumstances should you put them in cold water to
hasten their cooling.

Wipe and dry the kettle that they were boiled in and put in the whole
artichokes, the butter, and the cream. Return to medium heat. Cook,
tossing them frequently until the cream has thickened and lightly
coats the vegetables, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Season to taste with
salt and black pepper.  Transfer to a warm serving dish and serve at
opnce.
