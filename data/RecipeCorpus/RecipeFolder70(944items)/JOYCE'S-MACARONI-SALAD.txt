Title: JOYCE'S MACARONI SALAD
Categories: Improv, Kohl, Vegetables, Pasta
Yield: 1 Recipe
Eggs, boiled (when water
-boils, set timer for 20
-minutes)
Macaroni, cooked according
-to package directions
Onions, diced
1    Jar pimentoes, diced
Celery seed
Sweet relish
Salt & pepper
Miracle Whip Salad Dressing
Milk
Note: I've never measured the ingredients, but I suggest you use a
"rule-of-thumb" method: To approximately one quart pan of cooked
macaroni, use: At least 6 eggs, 1 medium onion, and about 1 heaping
tablespoon celery seed. Don't use too much relish (I sometimes leave
it out all together). You CAN use mayonnaise if you prefer, but we
prefer Miracle Whip for this salad. You'll need about half a quart!
You can add a smidgen of milk (enough for "washing" out the jar).
Just be sure your salad is good and "sloppy" ~ and before serving,
you'll more than likely need to add more Miracle Whip.

Put the cooked and drained macaroni into a large bowl (I use a
plastic bowl that has a lid). Add peeled chopped eggs, and the rest
of the ingredients - all except the Miracle Whip and milk. Toss the
mixture a little and then add Miracle Whip, mixing it well. Cover and
then refrigerate. Just before serving, you will probably need to add
more Miracle Whip. Can be topped with sliced eggs and/or paprika.
