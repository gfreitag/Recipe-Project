Categories: Hungary, Pasta, Dumpling
Yield: 6 Servings

1 ts Salt
2 tb Cream of Wheat or Farina
2    Eggs
3/4 c  Water

There are many recipes for dumplings. Every family makes theirs a
little different. Spaetzle are little dumpling, these are made with
Farina or Cream of Wheat. They are firmer than an all flour Spaetzle.
These are good in Chicken Soup, Tomato Soup, Chicken Paprikas, Beef
Gulyas. Regards, June Meyer.

Put flour, salt, and cream of wheat into a bowl. Make a well in the
middle and add the eggs, water and butter. Stir until batter is
smooth and thick. Cut the batter by teaspoon full into a big pot of
boiling salted water. Dip the spoon into the hot water each time to
keep the batter from sticking to the spoon. Cook only half the batter
at a time to avoid crowding. Stir the bottom of the pot with a wooden
spoon so that the dumplings will rise to the top. After the dumplings
rise, let them cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the water and drain.
Serve warm.
