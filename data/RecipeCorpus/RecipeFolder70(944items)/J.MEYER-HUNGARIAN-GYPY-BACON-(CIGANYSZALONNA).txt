Title: J.MEYER HUNGARIAN GYPY BACON (CIGANYSZALONNA)
Categories: Pork, Hungary
Yield: 1 Servings  My father was born in Romania. His Grandfather taught him how to make
Gypsy Bacon over the campfire and he taught his children. I remember
sitting around the camp fire in the local Forest Preserve, holding a
stick with a chunk of smoked bacon over the coals. Potatos were
buried in the embers and opened cans of pork and beans were standing
on stones in the campfire. Someone was alway dropping their bacon on
the dirt or the grass. Pick it up and burn off the dirt. Eat it.
Delicious.

Regards, June Meyer. Prepare a smoked cured slab of bacon, with the
rind still attached, by scoring it in 1 inch square sections down to
the rind. Cut off a 3 by 3 inch secton for each person. Skewer it on
a long fork or stick and hold it over the fire until the bacon starts
to cook and sizzle and the rind shrinks and curls up the bacon
sections. Is your mouth watering yet? Sprinkle paprika over bacon,
eat by cutting off an inch cube with a knife and topping it with
chopped sweet onion and hearty rye bread. Serve with cold beer and
Schnapps chasers. The taste is wonderful, good on those cold nights
around the campfire.

This type of bacon can be bought at german or hungarian deli or meat
markets. The bacon is firm, not soft. It is cured in a way which
permits you to also eat it in thin slices on bread as an appetizer.
