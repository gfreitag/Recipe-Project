There are two kinds of cole slaw served in Hungarian households. One
is the oil and vinegar slaw that is usually served in Winter, and the
other is this recipe for sour cream cole slaw that does not contain
any oil. It is a light, refreshing slaw, creamy and zesty. A perfect
salad to accompany a summer meal. Regards, June Meyer.

Wash hands and take off rings. Place your hands into the slaw, mix and
squeeze the slaw so it makes some juice. This will make the slaw limp.
Taste, add more salt if needed. Add more vinegar if more "bite" is
wanted. Sprinkle Paprika on top for beauty.  WALT Refrigerate till
serving time. Good the next day also. Serves 4 to 6.
