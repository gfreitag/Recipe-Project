Bring the apple juice or maple sap to a boil and place ham into it.
Cover and simmer over low heat for 3 hours, or till the ham is
tender. Remove meat from liquid and trim off rind only. Place the
sugar, mustard, cloves and water in saucepan, and add one cup of the

water. Serve the delicious sauce with the warm ham (which is equally
good cold).
