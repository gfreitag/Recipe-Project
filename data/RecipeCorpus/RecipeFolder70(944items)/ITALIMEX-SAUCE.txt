Categories: New import
Yield: 4 Servings
12 oz Ground turkey
1 ts Powdered crushed Oregano
Black pepper to taste
3    Green onions, chopped
1/2 bn Fresh cilantro, stems
Removed
4 ts Crushed garlic
1    Roasted bell pepper,

24 oz Tomato sauce
Brown turkey in large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Gradually
add oregano and black pepper, stirring constantly, followed by onions,
cilantro, garlic, bell pepper and tomatoes. Cook until meat is
browned, and vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Cover and simmer
10 minutes. Use as a topping for rice, pasta or couscous, as a
filling for burritos or atop baked potatoes. Makes 8 servings.

NOTE: To roast pepper using gas stove, wash pepper and place on
long-handled fork. Hold pepper in gas stove flame and turn constantly,
allowing skin to blister and blacken, but not burn or smoke. When
skin is thoroughly blackened, remove pepper from flame and place in
paper or plastic bag and allow to steam 15 minutes. Remove pepper and
scrape off skin with a table knife, then seed and finely chop pepper.

To roast in oven, set oven to broil and place pepper 4 inches from
heating element, turning frequently until skin is blackened. Follow
same procedure, placing pepper in bag, then seeding and chopping.
