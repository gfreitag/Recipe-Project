Chef Regina Charboneau makes these for her 2-year-old son, Jean-Luc.
Place a heavy sauce pot over medium heat and let preheat for about 3
minutes; add turkey wing, stir and turn until it begins to release
some of its oil. (If pan is hot enough, you should not have a problem
with sticking.) Add diced onion and stir to brown for about 3
minutes, adding garlic at end.

Add green beans, potatoes and water (enough to just cover the
vegetables) then cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender,
which may take 35 to 45 minutes, depending on size of potatoes.
Season with pepper and salt to taste (the turkey wing usually adds
enough salt).

Serves 6.
