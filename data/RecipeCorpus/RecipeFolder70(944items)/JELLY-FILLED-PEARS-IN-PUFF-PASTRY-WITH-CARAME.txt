4    Small Bartlett pears (about
-5 oz ea), peeled
4 ts Red currant jelly
1 pk (17 1/4 oz) frozen puff
-pastry (2 sheets), thawed
1    Egg yolk, beaten to blend

Vanilla ice cream (opt)
FOR SAUCE: Stir sugar and water in heavy medium saucepan over medium
heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring
until syrup turns deep-amber color, occasionally swirling pan and
brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush to dissolve any
sugar crystals. Remove from heat. Carefully stir in cream (mixture
will bubble vigorously). Cool. Stir in Calvados.  (Can be made 1 day
ahead. Cover and chill).

FOR PEARS:  Cut off top 1 1/2 inches from stem end of pears and
reserve. Core each pear through the top, leaving bottom intact. Spoon
1 teaspoon jelly into hole in each pear. Replace stem end.

On work surface, roll out each pastry sheet to  18x15 inch rectangle.
Cut out four 8 inch rounds and four 2 inch rounds. Reserve scraps.
Place pear in center of each 8 inch pastry round. Gather pastry
around each pear and pinch pastry to hold in place (stem end will be
exposed). Brush pastry with egg glaze.  Make hole in center of each
two inch pastry round. Fit 1 round over stem of each pear to form
top. Press firmly against pastry bottom to seal. Brush pastry top
with egg glaze. Cut out 4 small leaves from pastry scraps. Brush with
egg glaze and place 1 leaf just below stem of each pear. Refrigerate
at least one hour and up to
2    hours.

Preheat oven to 400F.  Butter baking sheet.  Place pears on prepared
sheet and bake until pastry is golden brown, about 25 minutes.

Rewarm caramel sauce over medium heat, stirring frequently. Spoon
sauce onto 4 plates.  Place hot pear in center of each plate. Serve
with scoops of vanilla ice cream, if desired.
