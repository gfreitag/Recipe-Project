Ah Paradise to eat Hungarian Tomato Soup. The tomato once feared as
being poisonous, was also called the Paradice Appfel or Apple of
Paradise. When my Grandmother came to this country from
Austria-Hungary, she brought not only flower seeds, Poppies included,
but all kinds of old-world tomato seeds. Hungarian heart shaped
tomatos, heavy, sweet and succulent. It was a yearly ritual in late
summer to can and bottle all those wonderful ripe tomatos the garden
produced. All winter long we children would be sent down to the
preserves cellar to bring up jars of tomatos, peppers, pickles,
dilled squash, plums, peaches, beets, jams and jellies. Alas, I no
longer have a garden so I must rely on store bought cans of tomatos.

Hungarian Pancakes, (Palacsinta) were always served after the soup
course. Thin crepes, slathered with strawberry jam, rolled up and
sprinkled with powdered sugar. This was a complete meal, good for a
Saturday noon, or Sunday night. Ah Paradise! Regards, June Meyer.

Saute bacon in a soup pot, and drain off bacon fat. Saute minced
onion and celery with bacon bits in pot till transparent. Add the can
of tomatos and add one can of water. Add 1 Tbls. sugar, and
peppercorns. Bring soup pot to low boil, and lower heat to simmer and
let simmer about
45    min. or 1hour. Soup can contain broad noodles, or rice.
precook these and add before serving. Serves 4 to 6.
