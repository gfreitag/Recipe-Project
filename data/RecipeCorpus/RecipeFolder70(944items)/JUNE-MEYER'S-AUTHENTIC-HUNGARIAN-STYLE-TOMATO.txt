This salad was always on the table during the summer months when the
garden was producing. It requires fresh sun ripened tomatoes. My
father loved this salad. He would often add a tablespoon of water to
the oil and vinegar to cut the acidity. A refreshing salad,
displaying the colors of Hungary! Red, White and Green. Regards, June
Meyer.

Slice the tomatoes and place in salad bowl. Peel cucumber, score
lengthwise and slice. Slice the banana peppers or chopped seeded
green pepper. Add the chopped parsley or dill, sliced onion, minced
clove and toss together. Add to bowl vinegar, sugar and oil. Toss
again, taste and adjust seasoning by adding salt and pepper if
needed. Let sit for 1/2 hour to mingle flavors.
