Title: JICAMA-PEA SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 c  Peeled, diced jicama
3/4 c  Seasoned rice vinegar
1 1/2 lb Unshelled peas; or 1 pkg.
10 oz. frozen tiny peas,
Thawed
1/4 c  Finely chopped fresh mint
8 to 16 large butter lettuce
Leaves, rinsed and crisped
Mint sprigs
In a bowl, combine jicama and vinegar; let stand for at least 15
minutes or up to 5 hours. If using fresh peas, shell them; you need 2
cups. In a 2- to 3-quart pan, cook shelled peas in about 1 inch of
boiling water; uncovered, stirring occasionally, just until peas are
bright green and heated through (2 to 3 minutes). Drain, immerse in
cold water until cool, and drain again. ( Don't cook frozen peas.)
Mix peas and chopped mint into jicama mixture. To serve, use a
slotted spoon to ladle salad equally onto 8 lettuce-lined plates.
Garnish with mint sprigs. Spoon any extra dressing over salads, if
desired.
