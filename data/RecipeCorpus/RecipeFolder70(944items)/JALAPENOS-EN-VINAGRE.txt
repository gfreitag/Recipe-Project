Categories: Preserves, Appetizers, Mexican, Peppers
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Jalapeno Peppers
2 c  Vinegar
1 c  Vegetable oil
3    Carrots cut in slices
2 md Onions cut in slices
1 tb Spices: Bay leaf, oregano
- Thyme, sweet marjoram
Cut the chiles in 4 slices, (if you want you can keep some without
cutting).  Cut the carrots in round slices and cut the onions in
slices. Fry the onion, peppers and carrots in the vegetable oil for
just a few minutes to make the vegetables soft, then add the vinegar
and spices and boil 3 or 4 min.  Let cool and then keep in glass
jars. Use immediatly or keep them in the refrigerator for 2 or 3
weeks.

Variations: You can add cloves of garlic and cauliflower, or add the
spices you like.  If you add more ingredients need also to add more
vineagar and oil.  The peppers and vegetables need to be covered with
oil and vinegar. If you like you can use less oil and more vinegar.
This recipe is basic, and you can make the changes as you like.
