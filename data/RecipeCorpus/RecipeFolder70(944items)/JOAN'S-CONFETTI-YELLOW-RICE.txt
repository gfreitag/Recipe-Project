Flavorful, colorful and delicious.

Annatto oil*  annatto seeds are achiote seeds. The seeds are simmered
in oil to extract the orange yellow color used in many Hispanic
dishes. The colored oil may color grains, pastries , vegetables or
even add a golden yellow color as a poultry baste. to make oil: Bring
1 cup oil ( I use olive ) with 1/2 cup annatto seeds to almost a
boil. Simmer 5 minutes. Strain oil and cool and refrigerate. Use
about 1 to 2 tsp in rice dishes. Annatto tends to be bitter, so use
sparingly. In small amounts no bitter taste is noticed. Of course
turmeric and curry do color and flavor but you may like to try this
for a pleasant change. Note: annatto really stains, so be careful not
to spill it !
