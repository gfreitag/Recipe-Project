Title: ITALIAN ICE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Lemons, juiced thoroughly
1 c  Sugar
1 tb Lemon rind, grated--opt.
Ice cubes
NOTE:  I use a high powered blender called a VITA MIX to make this
recipe. Take your chances if you use a regular blender, as chopping
the ice may be too much for it to handle. If you do use a regular
blender be sure to add the ice cubes one at a time. Put your lemon
juice and sugar in the blender container.  Blend until sugar is
dissolved. Do not wait until after the ice is put in to dissolve the
sugar as it will not dissolve completely. While blender is running
add ice cubes until the mixture turns to a slush and it cannot be
blended anymore. It may take several times of stopping and allowing
the mixture to settle or stirring it and then blending again. Just be
sure the mixture is thick and slushy. You may want to adjust the
taste with more sugar or lemon to your liking, but I found this to be
just right for our family.  Put mixture into individual freezer
containers and place in the freezer for at least four hours.  Voila!
Authentic Italian Ice! Do not substitute lemon concentrate as it does
not give the same taste result. Hope you like it.  This is one of my
originals.
