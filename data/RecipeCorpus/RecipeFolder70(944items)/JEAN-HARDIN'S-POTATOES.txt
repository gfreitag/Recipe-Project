Title: JEAN HARDIN'S POTATOES
Categories: Casseroles, Side dish
Yield: 6 Servings
32 oz Frozen southern-style hash
Browns
1 c  Butter
1 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
1/2 c  Chopped onion (I use more)
1 cn (10 1/2 oz) cream of
Chicken soup
1 c  Sour cream
2 c  Corn flake crumbs
Cook onion in 1/2 the butter until onions are soft. Add salt, pepper,
soup, and sour cream.  Stir till mixed. Pour mixture over the hash
browns which have been placed in a greased 9x13 casserole dish. Melt
the remaining butter and mix with the corn flake crumbs and top the
casserole. Bake at 350 F for 35-40 minutes.

Note:  I use 1/2 of the butter listed and usually use margarine. Also
it is better to take a kitchen form and stir the mixture into the
hash browns to sort of coat all of them.
