Title: JIGGS DINNER
Categories: Fish, Main dish, Nfld, Traditional
Yield: 1 Servings  Take a large piece of salt meat and soak in cold water overnight.
Next, place fresh water in the pot and boil salt meat on the stove
with a small amount of salt pork for 45 minutes or longer. While that
is boiling, prepare your vegetables.  Cut turnip in small pieces,
peel carrots, potatoes and prepare cabbage.  Add vegetables to the
boiling pot, beginning with turnips, then carrots, cabbage and lately
the potatoes, allowing 15 minutes between each vegetable. Cook until
the potatoes are done.

If cooking for your own family, a cup of peas placed in a cloth and
tied to a string may be hung in the pot to cook with your salt meat
dinner before the vegetables are placed in. They should be soaked in
cold water first, though.
