Title: JANE BRODY'S HIGH-CALCIUM CABBAGE BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 10 Servings
1/2 c  Finely shredded red cabbage
1/2 c  Finely shredded green cabbag
1 ts Lemon juice
1/2 c  Plain non/low-fat yogurt
1/4 c  Orange juice concentrate *
1/4 c  Canola oil
1/4 c  Powdered nonfat milk
1    Egg
1 c  Whole-wheat flour
3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Toasted sesame seeds
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt (optional)
1/8 ts Mace
1/8 ts Ground ginger
* 1/4 cup orange juice and 1 tablespoon sugar can replace concentrate.

The author says this can be made with 1 cup of only one type of
cabbage but for the sake of color would choose red cabbage.

1. Preheat oven to 350 F.

2. Place the cabbage in a small bowl and toss it with lemon juice.

3. In large measuring cup or medium bowl, combine the yogurt, orange
juice concentrate, oil, powdered milk and egg, blending the
ingredients well.  Stir in the cabbage.

4. In large bowl, combine the flours, sesame seeds, baking powder,
baking
soda, salt, mace and ginger, mixing them well.

5. Gradually add the cabbage mixture to the flour mixture and mix the
ingredients until they are just combined.  Pour the batter into a
greased 8x4 inch loaf pan.

6. Place the pan in hot oven and bake for 35-45 minutes or until a
tester
inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean. Turn the
bread
out onto a rack to cool completely before slicing.

This is a great bread to serve with a soup or salad meal. After the
first day, it is wonderful toasted. Try it, too, as a sandwich bread.
