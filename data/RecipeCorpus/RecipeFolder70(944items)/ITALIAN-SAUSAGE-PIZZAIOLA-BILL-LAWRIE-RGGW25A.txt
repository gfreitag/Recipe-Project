Brown sausage slowly, rendering as much grease as possible. Submerge
sausage in boiling water for 10-15 seconds to allow more grease to
float away. Saute mushrooms, onions, red pepper, artichoke hearts,
olives, garlic in olive oil until crisp-tender, about 3-4 minutes.
Add tomatoes, Italian seasoning, basil and sausage. Reduce heat and
simmer until it is of the right consistency. Add salt & pepper to
taste. Meanwhile, cut tops off rolls and hollow them out. Then place
in 350F oven for a few minutes until crusts are crisp. Fill each roll
with sausage/vegetable mixture. Sprinkle Romano atop each roll and
place under broiler just until cheese starts to melt. Serve this
alongside a green salad with Italian dressing* and a glass of
Bardolino or Chianti. *If you make your own Italian dressing, save
the artichoke marinade to mix into the dressing. Serves 4. Enjoy.
