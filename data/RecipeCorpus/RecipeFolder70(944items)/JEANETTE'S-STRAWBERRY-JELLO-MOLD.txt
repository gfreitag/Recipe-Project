Categories: Bananas, Nuts, Salads
Jeanette's Strawberry Jello
Mold -- see below
Yield: 1 Servings  :
:

Soften 1 envelope plain gelatine in 1/4 cup water. Dissolve it and 2
packages (3 oz) strawberry jello in 2 cups boiling water. ADD: 1
large or 2 small packages frozen strawberries 1 small can crushed
strawberries 1-2 diced bananas 1 cup fine chopped nuts
(optional-daughter disliked them so I left them out.) FILLING: 1 cup
sour cream(will use LandoLakes nofat) 1 package Dream Whip made up
Combine well. METHOD: Pour half of jello mix into mold and chill to
allow to become fairly firm. Spread filling over jello and pour over
that the rest of the jello. Allow to become very firm before
unmolding- like overnight. (I have to confess that we were usually
too impatient, and it was a pretty amusing dish, adding a little more
hilarity to some occasions than I thought absolutely necessary when I
attempted to unmold it.  Well it WAS pretty funny to see pieces of it
it sliding around the platter! But Jeanette's was always gorgeous, so
it can be done.  However, since we'll be having some
non-family-members at the table this year,  I'm considering serving
it from the bowl. On the other hand, why mess with tradition?)
