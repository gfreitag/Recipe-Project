1 c  Pecans, chopped
8 oz Cream cheese
8 oz Cool Whip
1 c  Sugar

Servings: 20

Mix flour, butter and pecans together until finely crumbled. Press
into 9-by-13-inch cake pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes.
Let cool.

Beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Fold in half of the Cool
Whip. Spread on top of the crust.

Mix 7 ounces (two packages) of instant chocolate pudding mix with 1
1/2 cups milk. Spread on top of cream cheese mixture. Mix 7 ounces
(two packages) of instant vanilla pudding mix with 1 1/2 cups milk.
Fold 3/4 basket of sliced fresh strawberries into vanilla pudding.
Spread on top of chocolate mixture. Cover the top with the remaining
Cool Whip.

Shave a chocolate candy bar with a potato peeler and add shavings to
the top of the finished cake. Refrigerate for two hours before
serving.

The dessert is outrageously rich, so plan to serve small portions. Do
not use frozen strawberries or sugar-free pudding mixes. Sliced
bananas may be substituted for the berries.
