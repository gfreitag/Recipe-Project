Soak peas overnight (Mark's note, soaking black-eyed peas before
cooking is unnecessary).  Simmer in fresh water for 15 minutes. Drain
& reserve cooking water. Slice eggplant into rounds 1/2" thick &
place in a colander. Sprinkle with salt & let stand 5 minutes. Heat
oil in casserole. Brown eggplant with 1 tb chopped onions, 1 tb
chopped ginger, 1 jalapeno, whole garlic & bell pepper for 5 minutes.
Remove eggplant & set aside. Add remaining onion, ginger, garlic,
jalapeno, bean liquid, tomatoes, tomato paste, cayenne, curry powder
& pepper sauce. Simmer for 10 minutes. Add peas, carrots & rice.
Simmer 5 minutes more. Add green beans, eggplant & simmer another 15
minutes. (Mark's note: 15 minutes for brown rice is far too short a
time, allow a good 20 minutes before adding the green beans &
eggplant).
