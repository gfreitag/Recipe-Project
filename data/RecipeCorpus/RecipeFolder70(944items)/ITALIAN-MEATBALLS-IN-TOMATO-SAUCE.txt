the tomatoes, the tomato paste, the stock, the wine, the sugar, the
romano, the salt and the oregano, and simmer the sauce, stirring
occasionally, for 30 minutes. MEATBALLS: In a bowl combine well the
bread, squeezed, the chuck, the eggs, the romano, the parsley, the
garlic, the oregano, the salt, and the pepper and form the mixture
into 10 meatballs. In a large skillet brown the meatballs in the oil
over high heat, turning them often. Transfer the meatballs to the
sauce with a slotted spoon and simmer the mixture, stirring
occasionally, for 30 minutes.  The dish improves in flavour if it is
cooled and chilled, covered, overnight or up to 2 days.
