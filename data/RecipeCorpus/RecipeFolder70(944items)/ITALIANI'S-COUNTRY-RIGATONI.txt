Make the bean broth: Place the beans and their liquid, the oregano,
onion and chicken broth in a sauce pot and bring to a boil. Reduce
heat to a slow simmer and cook 1 hour. Assemble the dish: Heat the
olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Add garlic and oregano
and cook, stirring, until garlic is lightly browned. Add tomatoes,
broccoli, chicken and sausage. Toss to heat all ingredients
thoroughly and mix well. Add the prepared bean broth and simmer for
10 minutes, or until liquid is reduced by 1/4th. Add the escarole and
stir in the butter, a tablespoon at a time. If you have precooked the
pasta, drop it into a hot water bath and rehaet but do not over cook.
Just before serving toss the drained pasta with the sauce and
Parmesan. Season with salt and white pepper to taste.
