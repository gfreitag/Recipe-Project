Title: JAPANESE SALAD
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 2 Servings
1    Carrot, cut into thin
Julienned strips
1/2    Green pepper, also cut into
Thin julienned strips
x  Some mung bean sprouts- I
Used about 2 C. or so.
Boil water.  Throw in carrot and let cook for a minute or two. Add
pepper and sprouts.  Turn off heat when water reboils. (I let it sit
a few minutes at this step and it was fine, still crispy). Drain the
vegies and rinse with cold water.  Chill.

Before eating toss with dressing:

~ 1 T. soy sauce - 2 T. rice wine vinegar - 1 t. sesame oil - sesame
seeds (for looks mostly)

I found I still had most of the dressing left in the bottom of the
dish, so not all of the sesame oil was consumed.

while on vacati on.

This makes enough for 2 side dishes or 1 large meal (for me). YMMV.
