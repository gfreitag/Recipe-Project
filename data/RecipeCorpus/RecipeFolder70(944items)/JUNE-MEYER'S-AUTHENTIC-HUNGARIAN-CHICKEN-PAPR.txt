Every country household had a yard full of chickens. Chicken dishes
that could be slow cooked on the stove for supper were plentiful and
cheap to make. Paprikas was a weekly dish for supper. A pot of potato
dumplings, and perhaps a platter of pickled hungarian peppers and a
loaf of crusty home baked bread was all that was need for ones well
being. Every meal was eaten with gusto.

Regards, June Meyer. Brown onions in shortening. Add seasonings and
chicken, brown 10 minutes. Add water, cover and let simmer slowly
until it is tender. It will smell wonderful! Remove chicken, add sour
cream to drippings in pan and mix well. To thicken gravy, mix into a
paste 1 Tbl. soft butter with 1 Tbl.of flour and stir into drippings.
Add dumplings and arrange chicken on top. Heat through,but do not
boil, and serve.

Modern Potato Dumplings Yes, I know this is not traditional. But it is
easy, fast and delicious.

Mix in a small bowl. Drop by spoonfuls into salted boiling water. cook
until dumplings look done when cut in half, about 5 or 6 minutes.
Drain and place into sour-cream gravy and serve. Serves 6 to 8.

Note: If you do not like dumplings, you can serve this with some
cooked wide egg noodles.
