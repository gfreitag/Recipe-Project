Prepare Dough: In a small bowl, combine water, yeast and sugar and
stir well to combine. Set aside for 5 minutes. In a large mixing
bowl, combine flour, semolina flour and salt. Add olive oil to the
yeast mixture. Stir well and add to flour. Add additional 1/2 cup
warm water. Bring the mass of dough together until a compact ball is
formed. Turn dough out onto work surface and knead vigorously for 7
minutes until smoth and satiny. Place a small amount of olive oil in
a large bowl. Put dough in the bowl and turn it twice to coat. Cover
bowl with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel. Set the bowl in a warm
place. Allow dough to double in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch down dough
and let stand for 20-30 minutes at room temperature before using.
Roll dough into a circle about 10 inches in diameter, building up the
edges slightly. Place dough on a pizza pan or baking sheet.

Prepare Toppings: Coat chicken with jerk seasoning. Heat olive oil in
a saute pan and when hot, sear chicken on both sides. Remove chicken
from pan, add mushrooms to pan and saute them for about 1 minute.
Drain liquid from pan. Slice chicken into thin strips.

Prepare Salsa: In a small mixing bowl, combine and mix thoroughly all
salsa ingredients.

To Assemble Pizza: Spoon barbecue sauce onto dough. Top with
mushrooms and chicken strips. Sprinkle cheeses on top. Bake pizza in
a preheated 450'F oven for 7-8 minutes until crust is browned and
cheese is golden and bubbly. Garnish pizza with mango salsa as soon
as pizza is removed from oven.
