Title: JERKY - WATER/SMOKER METHOD
Categories: Beef
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 lb Beef flank steak
1/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Paprika
1/4 c  Non-iodized salt
2 ts Garlic powder
2 ts Ground Black Pepper
1 ts Ginger
Fire up your smoker and start settling the coals in for a long slow
smoke before starting the rub.

Pat the meat dry with a paper towel and slice it, with the blade of
the knife 30 degrees to the horizontal, across the grain, creating
strips 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.

In a small mixing bowl, blend together the sugar, salt, paprika,
garlic powder, pepper and ginger.  Rub this mixture into the meat,
putting the spiced strips on the grill, but don't fill the water pan.
Give the jerky 3 to 5 hours of smoke at 130 to 180 degrees F.
propping the lid open a crack if the temperature threatens to rise
disastrously beyond the desired range.

When the strips are chewy-crisp, remove them from the heat, let cool,
and store individually in plastic wrap. Refrigerate to store longer
than a few days.
