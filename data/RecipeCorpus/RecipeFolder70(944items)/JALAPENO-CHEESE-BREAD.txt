Wow ... hot stuff!!  Serve this coarsely textured, very spicy bread
at your next cocktail party and watch it disappear. It's great with a
glass of wine or a cold beer, but its perfect partner is a frosty
margarita!

Place all ingredients in bread pan, select a light crust setting, and
press "start".

After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake
rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.

Note:  One of Linda's favorites.
