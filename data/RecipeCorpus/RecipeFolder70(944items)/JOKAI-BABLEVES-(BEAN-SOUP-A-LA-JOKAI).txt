Categories: Soups/stews, Ham/pork, Hungary, Upload
Yield: 8 Servings
2 ea Pig's feet, smoked
1/2 lb Pork ribs, smoked
1 ea Celery knob; peeled, diced
1/4 lb Beans
1 md Onions; peeled, chopped
1 tb Lard
1 tb Parsley; chopped
1 tb Flour, all-purpose
1/2 tb Paprika
1 ea Garlic cloves; mashed
1/2 lb Pork sausage, smoked
Salt
2 tb Sour cream
Cook smoked pig's feet and pork ribs in 2 quarts water till the meat
comes of the bones. Bone them and put meat pieces aside.
Add the diced celery and the beans to the meat broth, cook till
beans are done.
Meantime, fry onion in lard over low heat. When onion is wilted, add
chopped parsley and flour and make a brown roux over the lowest heat
possible. Stir often to prevent burning.
When the roux is light brown, mix in paprika and garlic;
immediately add 1 cup cold water. Whip till smooth, then pour into
the cooked beans.
Add smoked sausage and 1/2 tablespoon salt. Simmer for 10 minutes.
Cut smoked meats into small pieces, and add to the soup. Adjust
salt. Add the sour cream.
Serve with Little Pinched Dumplings (recipe).
Almost any type can be used, cranberry or pinto beans, for
instance. If you use dried beans, sook them overnight first.
