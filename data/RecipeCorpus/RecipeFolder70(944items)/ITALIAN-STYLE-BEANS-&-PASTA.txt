Title: ITALIAN-STYLE BEANS & PASTA
Categories: None
Yield: 8 Servings
1 cn Garbanzo beans
1 cn Great Northern Beans
1 cn Red kidney beans
1    Or 2 cans diced cooked
Tomatoes
2 lg Carrots
1    Or 2 large onions, chopped
2    To 6 cloves of chopped
Garlic
2 lg Carrots, cut in thin strips
2    Stalks celery, cut in
Chunks
3    To 4 heaping Tbsps of
Italian Seasoning
1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
1/2 lb Pasta
Saute garlic and onion till soft.  Add beans (entire can) and
tomatoes and 3 ca ns of water. When hot, add Italian Seasoning. Bring
to a boil, then cook till sp ices are well-blended. Add pasta,
carrots and celery and cook till pasta is ready - - about ten
minutes. Carrots should be slightly crunchy.  Adjust seasonings if
desired. This makes a thick stew. If you like it wetter, use more
water.

I expect you could lower the fat by reducing the amount of beans.
This is an adaptation of a recipe calling for sausage and other meat.
You can add non-fat Parmesan cheese at the table if you want.

Serves 8 or 9.
