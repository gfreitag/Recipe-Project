Categories: Mexican, Tex-mex
1 md jicama
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg carrot
1 md zucchini
3    chipotle peppers in adobo
with liquid
:
1 c  onion -- finely chopped
4    cloves garlic -- minced
1    bay leaf

1/2 c  white vinegar
1/2 c  water
1/3 c  olive oil
2 TB cilantro -- chopped
1 ts oregano -- rubbed

:

Using a knife, remove the skin from the jicama. Cut the flesh into
half inch dice. Place in a glass or earthenware bowl. Peel the
carrot. Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil and drop the carrot
in. Let the water return to the boil and then remove the carrot and
discard the water. When the carrot is cool enough to handle, cit it
into half inch dice. Add to the bowl with the jicama. Scrub the
zucchini well but do not peel it. Trim, then cut it into half inch
dice and add it to the bowl. Drain the chipotle, reserving the
pickling sauce (use one chili for a relatively mild marinade; three
will be stinging hot). Cut the chilies open lengthwise and scrape out
the seeds (if your fingers are sensitive, you may want to wear rubber
gloves). Finely chop the chilies and place them in a separate, medium
sized bowl. Add the onion, garlic, bay leaf, peppercorns, vinegar,
water, olive oil, and cilantro to the chipotle in the bowl. Blend in
the reserved chipotle sauce.  Crumble the oregano between your
fingers into the bowl. Whisk all the ingredients together, then pour
the marinade over the jicama mixture. Toss the vegetables with the
marinade to coat them completely. Add salt to taste. Cover the relish
and refrigerate for at least four hours, preferably overnight.  Serve
as an accompaniment for grilled meats or fish. Yield is about 6 cups.
