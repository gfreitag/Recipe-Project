This is a traditional winter soup. It is served in three courses.
First the broth is served with fine or broad egg noodles. Then the
meat and vegetables are served along with a cold sourcream and
horse-radish sauce. This is a slow cooking soup, that tastes
wonderful. It is worth the time it takes. It makes a cold winter day
cosy. This serves a family.

Regards, June Meyer.

Sear meat in pot. (This gives greater flavor and color) Cover with
water. Let it come to a boil and skim the foam off. Add salt, pepper
corns, and let simmer for 1 hour. Stick 2 cloves into each onion. Add
the carrots, celery, parsley root and greens, parsnips and onions.
Cover and simmer slowly for about 2 hours. Add potatos last hour of
cooking.

Serve strained soup broth with drained cooked egg noodles. Arrange
vegetables and meat on serving platter. Serve meat and vegetables
with Sour Cream and Horse-Radish sauce, Tomato Sauce or Dill Sauce.
Add some crusty bread and enjoy a wonderful meal. Serves 4 to 6.
