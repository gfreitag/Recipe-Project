Categories: Seafood, Tex/mexican, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
-(about 2 1/2 pounds each)
2    Groupers or red snappers
Yield: 6 servings

_One_day_ahead_:

Do not have the scales removed from the fish.  Have the heads and
tails removed and the fish opened out flat in one piece. Remove the
backbone. 1 tablespoon ground achiote (annato) seeds Available in the
Latin American food section of most supermarkets and Latin American
and Carribean markets. 1/4 teaspoon peppercorns 1 1/2 teaspoons salt,
or to taste 1/4 teaspoon oregano, lightly toasted in a small frying
pan 1/4 teaspoon hot paprika 3 cloves garlic, peeled 1/4 cup Seville
orange juice, or mild white vinegar

In a blender or food processor, blend all the ingredients together to
a smooth paste.  Spread the paste over the flesh of the fish and set
it aside to season for several hours of every night.

_On_serving_day_:

Brush the seasoned side of the fish with a little olive oil and cook
it, seasoned side down, over the charcoal or under the broiler for
about 10 minutes.

Turn the fish over and cook it on the skin side for a slightly longer
period or until the flesh is _just_ cooked through - about 15 to 20
minutes, depending on the fish.

Serve the fish hot with fresh tortillas, so that everyone can make
his own tacos, with small dishes of the following served separately:

Toasted oregano Chopped chiles habaneros or cayennes Sliced avocado
Pickled onion rings (does anybody really want this recipe!?) Sliced
tomato Sliced Seville oranges
