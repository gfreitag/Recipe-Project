2    Blue crabs

2    Stalks lemon grass
2 ts Tamarind
1/2 c  Boiling water
1    Handful coriander leaves
3    Cloves garlic

Cut 4 green blue swimmers into quarters with a cleaver or large
knife. With a hammer, gently crack the claws and harder sections of
shell.

Finely chop 6 shallots and 2 stalks lemon grass. Steep 2 teaspoons
tamarind in half a cup of boiling water. Chop a handful of fresh
coriander leaves.

In a food processor, grind together 3 cloves garlic, 1 tablespoon
fresh galangal, 2-3 birdseye chillies, seeded, 4 candlenuts (or
substitute 8-10 cashews) and 1 teaspoon blachan (hard dark brown
shrimp paste), 1 teaspoon turmeric and salt and pepper to taste.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large wok or pan, and fry the paste until
fragrant. Add shallots, lemon grass, crab pieces and 2 cups coconut
milk. Simmer for quarter of an hour. Strain the tamarind water and
add half to the sauce. Taste and add more if you wish. Ladle curvy
into a serving dish and scatter the fresh coriander on top. Serve
with plain rice.
