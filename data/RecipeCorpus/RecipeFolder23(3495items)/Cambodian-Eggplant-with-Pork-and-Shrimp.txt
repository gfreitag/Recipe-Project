strips about 1 inch thick.'

Heat oil in a wok or saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook
until lightly browned. Add pork, chile, soy sauce, fish sauce, chili
powder and sugar; cook, stirring, until meat loses its raw color. Add
stock and water and bring to a boil. Add lime sauce, shrimp and
eggplant; simmer until shrimp are done. Season with salt and pepper.

or food processor and liquefy. Combine fish sauce, lime juice, sugar
and chile-garlic mixture in a small bowl. Stir to dissolve sugar. If
using sauce by itself, add a bit of shredded carrot for garnish.
