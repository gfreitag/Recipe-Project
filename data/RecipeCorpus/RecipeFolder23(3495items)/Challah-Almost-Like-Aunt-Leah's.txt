Title: Challah Almost Like Aunt Leah's
Categories: Bread, Jewish
Yield: 8 servings
3    Egg
7 c  Flour; (adjust as needed)
1/2 c  Oil
5 ts Yeast, dry
2 c  Potato water
3/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt
Dissolve yeast in potato water.  Add sugar, and let stand five
minutes. Add salt and beaten eggs.  Stir in four cups of the flour.
Add oil, stirring while adding.  Stir in enough remaining flour to
make dough that forms a ball and is not sticky.

Put dough on a floured board.  Cover with a towel and let rest 10
minutes. Knead 10 minutes.  Put in a greased bowl, and let rise until
it doubles (about one hour).  Punch down.  Braid to form two loaves
and place on cookie sheets.  Let rise again, approximately 50
minutes.  Use a pastry brush to gently coat with a glaze made of a
beaten egg and a few drops of water.  Sprinkle the top with sesame
seeds.  Bake at 350 degrees until well done (approximately 45 to 50
minutes).
