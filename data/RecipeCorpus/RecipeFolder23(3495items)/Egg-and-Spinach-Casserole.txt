cheese in this recipe. Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat 1/8-inch
of vegetable oil in an 8-inch skillet over medium heat, just until
hot. Cook the tortillas, one at a time, in the oil until crisp, about
1 minute. Drain on paper towels and then cut them into small pieces.

and stir the bacon, onion, and garlic in the margarine and 1 tbls of
vegetable oil, in a 10-inch skillet until the onion is tender. Stir
in the tomatoes, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.  Simmer uncovered for 3
minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the spinach, cover and cook until
the spinach is wilted, about 3 minutes. Line the bottom of an
ungreased square 8 X 8 X 2-inch pan with the tortilla chips or
pieces. Spread the spinach mixture over them. Cut the eggs lengthwise
into halves and arrange them on the spinach mixture. Pour the Basic
Green Sauce over the eggs; sprinkle with the cheese and bake,
uncovered until the cheese is melted, abut 15 minutes.
