Categories: Appetizer, Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Lump crabmeat, picked clean
1/2 c  Dry, unflavored bread crumbs

Chesapeake Bay Crab Cakes

Parsley, lemon wedges, tartar sauce as desired

Using an electric blender or wire whisk, beat together mustard, lemon
juice and egg until thoroughly combined.  While  beating vigorously,
gradually pour 4 Tbs of olive oil  into  the  egg mixture in a thin
stream. When smooth and creamy, stir in salt and pepper.

Gently fold in crabmeat, then bread crumbs and cayenne  pepper. Shape
into 8 patties, each about a half-inch thick. They  will want to fall
apart, but that's the idea of a good  crab  cake. You want only
enough non-crab stuff to just barely bind them.

Melt  butter together with 2 Tbs of olive oil in  skillet  over medium
heat.  When butter sizzles (but before it burns!) gently ease the crab
cakes into the skillet  to  cook.   When  well browned (2 to 3
minutes), gently turn and  cook  other  side. Drain on paper towels.
Serve immediately.

Makes 4 main-course servings, 8 appetizers
