Title: Hot Red Snapper Soup (Korean Domi Chigae)
Categories: Asian, Seafood, Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
1/2    Cake bean curd
2 c  Water
2 tb Kochu Chang
1/4 lb Lean beef (shoulder)
1 1/2 lb Red snapper
2 ea Scallions
2    Cloves garlic
A chigae is usually a hot soup comprised of several ingredients. In
this case, meat has been cooked with fish, the one to impart body,
the other to add flavor. Kochu Chang is red bean paste, which may be
purchased at many Oriental food stores. If it is not available,
Japanese miso sauce may be substituted.

1.  Shred the beef into 2-inch lengths. Cut the red snapper across
the body into 1 1/2-inch widths, leaving the bones inside. Cut the
scallions into 2-inch cubes.

2.  Arrange the pieces of fish on the bottom of a pot. Add the
scallions, then the beef. Now add the garlic. Mix the kochu chang
with water and pour it over the other ingredients. Bring to a boil,
then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Just before serving
add the bean curd and cook for 3 minutes.

Variation: Instead of red snapper, use a 1 1/2 to 2-pound sea bass,
or a 1-pound codfish, or 2 small lobsters.
