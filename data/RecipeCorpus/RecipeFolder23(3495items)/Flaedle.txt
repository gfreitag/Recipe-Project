Title: Flaedle
Categories: Breakfast, Soup/stew, German
Yield: 4 servings
1 pn Salt
Fat for frying
200 g  Flour (1 3/4 cups)
2    Eggs
1/4 l  Milk (1 cup plus 1 Tbsp)
Mix the flour and milk, then add the eggs, and season with salt.  In a
skillet, melt a little fat over medium heat.  As soon as the fat is
hot, hold the skillet at a slight angle and pour in the batter in
such a manner that the whole bottom of the skillet is covered with a
thin layer.  As soon as the bottom of the pancake develops yellow
spots, carefully loosen the edges with an eggturner, then flip the
pancake to cook the other side. Once the 'Flaedle' is done, set it
aside for cooling.

If the 'Flaedle' is to be used in 'Flaedle'-soup, roll it up and cut
it into very thin slices.  Put into hot broth, and adjust seasoning
to taste, with nutmeg, chopped parsley or chives, etc.

Serves 4.
