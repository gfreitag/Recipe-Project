Time: 2:00 Peel the onion and slice into thin rings. Wash beef, drain
it well, and put in an earthenware bowl with the onion, peppercorns,
cloves, bay leaf, vinegar, and 1-1/3 cups water. Cover the bowl and
allow the meat to marinate in a cool place for 4 to 6 days. Turn the
meat twice daily, adding additional vinegar and water as needed to
keep the meat covered. Once the marinating is complete, remove the
meat and dry it. In a pot, heat the shortening.  Brown the meat on
all sides and salt it to taste. Carefully add 1 cup hot water from
the side of the pot and crumbled ginger snaps. Leave the pot to
simmer gently with the lid on.  Turn the meat from time to time,
adding water if necessary.  The will be about 1 1/2 hours. When the
meat is ready, serve it with  the gravy in which it has been cooked
thickened with a bit of corn starch if necessary. This is very good
with dumplings. 
