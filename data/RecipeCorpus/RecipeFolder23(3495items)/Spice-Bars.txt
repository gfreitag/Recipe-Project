Stir together the spices, salt flour, and baking powder.  Stir in the
almonds and lemon rind.  In a separate bowl beat the eggs and sugar
until a ribbon is formed when the beater is removed.  Stir in the
honey and milk. Gradually stir in the flour mixture; beat until
smooth.  Spread the batter in an 11 X 17-inch jelly roll pan that is
well greased and floured. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12 to 15 minutes,
until the cake is done. While the cake is still warm, turn it out
onto a wire rack.  To make the almond glaze, mix the confectioners'
sugar, almond extract, rum, and 1 to 2 T of water. Beat until glaze
is smooth and of the right consistency. Add more water to thin if
neccessary.  Spread the warm cake with the almond glaze. Cut cake
into 1 X 2 1/2-inch bars while still warm.  Spice bars keep 6 to 8
weeks in a sealed container if not glazed. Makes 4 dozen bars.
