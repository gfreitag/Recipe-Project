Categories: Potato, Kids

8    Hot dogs
2 c  Mashed potatoes
From: Grandma Sheila, COOKING echo

Split hot dogs the long way not quite all the way through.  Fill split
opening with mashed potatoes mixed with dry mustard. Sprinkle the top
with paprika. Bake in 375 degree oven for about 15 minutes or until
heated through and slightly browned on top. Can also be topped with
some grated cheese (cheddar or parmesan).

These make a great lunch or dinner for kids.  Mine used to ask for
them regularly - still do now that they are grown.
