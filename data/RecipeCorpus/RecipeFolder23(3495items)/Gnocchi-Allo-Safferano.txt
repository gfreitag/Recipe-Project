Fat grams    per serving:
make gnocchi, pour flour onto work surface and make a well in the
centre. Pour in the olive oil.  Dissolve saffron in a bit of warm
water and add to well. Mix liquid with flour, adding enough water to
form a firm, not sticky, dough.  You'll have to add the water 1/4 cup
at a time, until the dough is the right consistency.  Cut dough into
pieces and roll into long cylinders, about 1/2 inch diameter.  Cut
into 1-inch chunks and press your finger into each gnocchi to make a
deep dent. Set gnocchi aside on a floured surface to dry while you
make the sauce. Heat pork fat in saute pan and cook the onion and
parsley until tender. Stir in the ground meat and cook until no
longer pink.  Add the chopped tomatoes, bay leaves, salt and pepper.
Cook, uncovered, for an hour or until the sauce is thickened. Cook
gnocchi in boiling salted water until cooked al dente.  Drain and
arrange in pasta dishes.  Pour sauce over top and garnish with a
handful of grated cheese. Serves 4-6. By Peter Duri of the Italian
