Title: Red Eye Gravy
Categories: Misc/food
Yield: 6 servings
Pork drippings
1/3 c  Strong black coffee
After cooking the breakfast meat (bacon, ham or sausage), remove it
from the iron skillet and put aside. To the drippings, pour 1/3 cup
of strong coffee and stir while on the fire. Pour over hot grits or
sop up with hot biscuits.

The above is from "White Trash Cooking"; Ernest Matthew Mickler.

My mother has made red-eye gravy as long as I can remember, but she
does not use coffee in the drippings.

I don't have measurements, but when the breakfast meat is done
(usually country ham), she allows the drippings to get VERY hot in
the pan (cast iron skillet) then pours water in and again let's this
get VERY hot.

Hope this combination of "techniques" is helpful.
