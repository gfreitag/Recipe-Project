Apricot preserves

Make the Plunderteig and chill it.   Roll 1/3 of the dough out 1/2"
thick.  Cut it into 3" triangles and brush each triangle with beaten
egg. Place a tablespoon or so of the almond paste, shaped in a small
roll, on the base of each triangle.  Cover each triangle with 1
tablespoon of the candied fruit and sprinkle them with a little
cinnamon sugar.  Roll up the triangles and shape them gently into
crescents.  Brush them with beaten egg and let them rise, covered, on
a buttered baking sheet in a warm place until they double in bulk,
about 1 1/2 hours.  Bake in a 350 degree F. oven (moderate) for 20
minutes, or until they are puffed and golden brown.
Brush them immediatelyh with apricot preserves.
Mandelfulle:  Grind the almonds and stir in the sugar.  Add the egg
and beat until the paste is very smooth.
