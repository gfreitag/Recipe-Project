A recipe from grandmother's more thrifty times; rarely encountered
today.

Melt the butter, and whisk in flour.  Add meat broth or water. Add the
rinsed and chopped herbs, and briefly bring to a boil. Let soup cool
a bit, then thicken with egg yolk.  Season with salt, pepper, and a
pinch of sugar.  Stir in sour cream when serving.

In some Swabian kitchens, very finely chopped garlic gets scattered
on top of the soup.

Serves 4.
