Categories: Kids, Snack
Yield: 6 servings
-graham crackers
Sprinkles
1 pt (2 cups) heavy cream
2 tb Honey or sugar
32    Squares (16 rectangles) of
Beat cream with sweetener until stiff. Spread whipped cream heavily
on one square and place it on a platter. Spread cream heavily on a
second square and place it on top of the first. Continue until there
is a stack of 4 squares. Press down gently on the top square so the
cream squeezes out of the sides. Spread the excess along the sides.
Repeat the procedure until there are eight stacks. Slide them
together till sides touch to form a rectangular cake of 2 squares by
4 squares. Use extra whipped cream to smooth over all the tops.
Refrigerate. Allowing it to chill several hours before serving
enables the crackers to soften. A dash of sprinkles over the top adds
a party flavor with adding much additional sugar.

Hint: Use a pressurized can of whipped cream if you don't have the
time or inclination to whip the cream.
