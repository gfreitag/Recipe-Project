Categories: Potato, Vegetable, Appetizer
Yield: 24 servings
24    Walnut halves, toasted
24    Fresh dill sprigs
24    Baby red potatoes
3/4 c  Sour cream
Cook potatoes in boiling water for 8 to 12 minutes until just tender.
Drain and cool.  Slice off the bottom end of each potato so it sits
upright and slice off a third of the top. (If potaotes are medium
small cut them in half and use both halves) With a melon baller,
scoop out the potato and fill with a dollop of sour cream. Top with
walnut halves and tuck in a sprig of dill.
