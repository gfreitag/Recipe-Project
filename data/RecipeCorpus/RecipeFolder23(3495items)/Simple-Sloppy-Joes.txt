2 lb Beef
4 cn Manwhich; (ready made sauce)
2 md Onions; diced
I never had a recipe for this when the kids were little; but this is
what I would do.  I browned the meat with the garlic, onion and
celery; then added tomato sauce (now I would use Manwhich).  Just
simmer for about 1/2 hour. Serve over hamburger rolls.
