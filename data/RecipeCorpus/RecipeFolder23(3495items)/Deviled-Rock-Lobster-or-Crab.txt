This  recipe is equally good with lump crabmeat,  or using  the frozen
lobster tails;  whichever is available. Melt butter, add onion which
has been grated along with onion juice.  Cook a few minutes until
onion is tender.  Add dried mustard,  salt,  then flour. Slowly add
milk and make your cream sauce.  Allow your sauce to thicken,
stirring constantly, and then add all  the other ingredients. Serve
this in flaky pastry shells. This will serve six.
