~-- Cut across the middle of the sponge cake to form two disks, about
1"-1-1/2" thick, each.  Blend the coffee or espresso and liqueur
together.
Sprinkle the bottom half of the cake with the coffee liqueur blend,
enough to flavor it strongly, but don't saturate the cake so much
that it will collapse.  Mix the cream cheese or mascarpone with the
sugar and beat the cheese until the sugar is completely dissolved and
the cheese is light and spreadable.  Spread the bottom half off the
cake with half of the creamy cheese, in a fairly thick layer.  Set
the second half of the cake on the bottom half and repeat the process
~ sprinkle the coffee/liqueur blend and spread with the remaining
cream cheese.  Put the cocoa powder into a wire strainer and coat the
top layer of cream cheese completely with cocoa. Refrigerate the cake
for at least two hours before cutting and serving.
