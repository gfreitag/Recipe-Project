Grease a frying pan lightly and fry lamb until browned on each side
but not cooked through.  Place each chop or steak on a 25 cm (10
inch) square of foil.  Drain fat from pan, add butter, onion and
garlic and fry gently until onion is soft.  Spoon on top of meat,
leaving butter in pan.  Place 2 slices of potato on each chop and
brush with this butter.  Top with slices of tomato and sprinkle
lightly with oregano or rigani.  Finish with a slice of cheese on top
and fold foil, using double folds to seal each package completely.
Place close together in a baking dish (cheese uppermost) and cook in
a moderately slow oven for 1-1/2 hours.

Serve packages directly onto individual plates.  Accompany with a
tossed green salad.
