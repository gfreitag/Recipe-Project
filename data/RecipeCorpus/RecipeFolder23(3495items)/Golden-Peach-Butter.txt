Title: Golden Peach Butter
Categories: Condiment
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Lemon juice
-Grated zest of 2 lemons
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground cloves
4 lb Ripe peaches;
Pitted and quartered
-(about 3-1/2 quarts)
2 c  Water
2 c  Sugar
In a large saucepan, bring the peaches and water to a boil over a
medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until
peaches are very tender. In a food processor fitted with the metal
blade or a blender, process the fruit mixture in batches until
smooth. Return the puree to the saucepan and stir in the sugar, lemon
juice, lemon zest, cinnamon, and cloves. Bring to a boil over medium
heat, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to low and simmer,
stirring often, until thickened and reduced to about 6 cups, about 30
minutes. Ladle the peach butter into hot, sterilized jars, leaving
1/4 inch of headroom. Wipe the rims clean and put the lids on the
jars. Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. Remove the jars
from the water and cool completely at room temperature. Makes about 3
pints. Source: "An Edible Christmas" (A Treasury of Recipes for the
