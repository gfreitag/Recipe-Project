1 T  Wine vinegar
-fresh ground black pepper
1 t  Chopped garlic
4    6-oz angler fillets

Have all ingredients at room temperature.  Julienne angler crosswise
into 1/2-inch strips.  Combine the vinegar, salt and pepper in a
warmed stainless steel or other heatproof bowl.  Toss the cabbage in
this mixture, adjust seasoning to taste, and keep warm. Saute the
fish and garlic in oil until just done, pour the hot oil and fish
