Title: Spiced Pickled Day-Lily Buds
Categories: Can/preserv
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Whole allspice
2    Two-inch sticks cinnamon,
-broken up
10    To 12 whole cloves
2 qt Day lily buds, freshly
-boiled and drained
3 c  White vinegar
3/4 c  Light brown sugar, packed
1/2 ts Salt
Rinse and drain unopened day lily buds; clip off any stem remnants.
Put buds in a saucepan; add water barely to cover.  Bring quickly to
a boil, cover, and simmer 20 minutes.  Drain.  (At this point, the
buds can also be served as a simple vegetable dish after adding salt,
pepper, spices, etc. Another thing I do with them is to stuff them
with ricotta cheese and serve them that way.)  Anyway, back to the
canning recipe!

Pack hot buds into 8 sterile half-pint canning jars.

Combine vinegar, brown sugar, salt, allspice, cinnamon, and cloves in
a saucepan and bring to a boil; boil 3 minutes.

Pour pickling solution over buds, distributing spices equally.  Seal
at once.

Yield:  8 half-pints.  Let these stand for a few weeks before using,
to further develop the spicy flavor.

Note:  Don't harvest day lilies within 50 feet of roadways due to
automobile emissions.
