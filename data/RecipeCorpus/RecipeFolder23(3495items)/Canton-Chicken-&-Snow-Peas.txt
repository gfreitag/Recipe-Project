2 T of the oil.  When oil begins to heat, add garlic and stir once.
Add chicken and stir-fry until chicken is opaque (about 3 minutes).
Remove chicken from pan.  Add remaining 1 T oil to pan.  When oil is
hot, add mushrooms and bamboo shoots.  Stir-fry for one minutes,
adding a few drops water if pan appears dry.  Add snow peas and
stir-fry for 1 1/2 minutes, adding a few drops more water if pan
appears dry.  Return chicken to pan. Stir cooking sauce, add to pan,
and cook, stirring until sauce bubbles and thickens.

blanched almonds in 1 T salad oil over medium-low heat until golden;
remove from pan and set aside.  Stir in nuts just before serving.
