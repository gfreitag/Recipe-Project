Title: Golden Egg Bread (Challa)
Categories: Bread, Jewish
Yield: 16 servings
6 tb Vegetable oil
1 1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Water; warm
1 pk Yeast
3 c  Flour
4 tb Sugar
2    Eggs
Combine all ingredients in the pan in the order listed and select
white bread; push start When I make this into Challa, I remove from
the breadmaker after the manual mode stops; let rise; braid*; and put
an egg wash over the challa. Then bake in a 350 degree oven until a
light toasty brown. I usually sprinkle on some type of seeds (sesame
or poppy) after the egg wash. *Braiding in the flat manner. The
middle one goes under and over; never across.
