Sauterne may be replaced by other white wines in this sweet tart
jelly. The flavor lends itself for use both as a spread on breads and
as a meat glaze. It can also be reheated for use as a dessert sauce
on ice cream, sliced oranges, or berries.

Place orange juice, sauterne, and lemon juice in heavy saucepan. Mix
together 3/4 cup sugar and the powdered light fruit pectin. Add to
wine mixture. Cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until mixture
comes to a hard boil. Stir in remaining sugar. Bring to a rolling
boil, stirring constantly. Boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and
skim off foam with metal spoon. Immediately pour into hot sterilized
jars, add optional sprigs of tarragon, if desired, and vacuum seal
(hot water bath method, or can be refrigerated up to 6 weeks).
