Title: Holdermus (Elderberry Mush)
Categories: German
Yield: 4 servings
1/8 l  Milk (1/2 cup plus 1/2 Tbsp)
50 g  Butter (3 1/2 Tbsp)
1 tb Flour
500 g  Elderberries without stems
-(a generous lb)
Sugar to taste
1 pn Salt
From the Allgaeu area.

Pull the elderberries off their stems and briefly cook in a skillet
with very little water.  Then add either a roux or a smooth mixture
of milk with a little bit of flour.  Constantly stirring, bring to a
good boil.  Add a spoonful of honey.  If the mush has been made with
the milk/flour mixture, then pour hot clarified butter on top.

In some places, pan-toasted bread cubes are scattered on top.  The
elderberry mush is served directly in the copper skillet.

Serves 4.
