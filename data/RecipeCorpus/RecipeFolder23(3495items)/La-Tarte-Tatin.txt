Title: La Tarte Tatin
Categories: Dessert, French
Yield: 4 servings
- and tossed with
Lemon juice
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 c  Unsalted butter; melted
Sugar
1/2 lb Puff pastry
-(fresh or thawed frozen)
1 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Water
5 lb Golden Delicious apples
- peeled, cored, quartered
FOR PASTRY: Preheat oven to 300 F.  Roll pastry 1/8 inch thick.  Cut
into circle 1 inch larger than diameter of 1-quart-souffle dish.
Transfer to baking sheet, prick with fork and bake 30 minutes.  If
not quite browned, increase heat to 350 F.  Combine 1/2 cup sugar
with water in 8-inch skillet and cook, swirling pan frequently, until
carmelized.  Pour into 1-quart souffle dish.  Begin adding apples,
arranging vertically (fill dish as compactly as possible since fruit
will shrink during baking).  Lay remaining apples (or as many as
possible) on top.

Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon.  Pour melted
butter evenly over top.  Cover with foil, making several slits to
allow steam to escape.  Lay piece of foil on lower oven rack to catch
any juices that might overflow.  Bake, basting frequently, until
apples are tender, about 1-1/2 hours.  Remove from oven and cool 15
minute.  Carefully pour off juices into 8-inch skillet and boil over
medium-high heat until reduced and carmelized.

Run knife around inside of souffle dish to loosen apples.  Set pastry
over fruit.  Place serving plate on top and invert.  Pour carmelized
juices over top.  Heat heavy skillet until quite hot.  Dust tarte
with sugar and hold bottom of hot skillet over top of tarte to sear
sugar, or place under broiler.  Repeat 3 more times.  Serve warm or
cold.
