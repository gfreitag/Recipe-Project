2    Garlic cloves; chopped fine
1    1" piece ginger root; peeled
-and finely chopped
1 tb White wine vinegar
1 tb White wine
1 ts Cornstarch
1 tb Brown sugar
1 ts Sesame oil
1/4 ts Salt
1 lb Chicken breasts
-boneless, skinless,
- cut into 1" pieces
3 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Cornstarch
1    Egg white; beaten frothy
1 c  Vegetable oil
3    Dried hot chili peppers
-broken in half
In a glass bowl, place chicken pieces. Combine 1 tb. soy sauce and 1
tb. cornstarch. Blend in beaten egg white. Pour over chicken and toss
to coat well. Marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour.

In a small bowl, combine remaining soy sauce, vinegar, white wine,
and 1 tsp. cornstarch; mix until smooth. Stir in sugar, sesame oil
and salt.

In a wok heat oil. Deep-fry chicken, a few pieces at a time, about 1
minute, or until golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towel. Pour
all but 2 tb. oil out of wok. To the wok, add chili peppers, garlic
and ginger; stir-fry 1 minute.

Pour sauce mixture into wok and cook, stirring, about 1 minute, until
thickened. Return chicken pieces to wok. Mix well and serve
immediately.

I like to serve this with rice and Sauteed Snow Peas and Red Peppers.
The chicken is spicy hot with the dried chili peppers, so adjust to
your taste. Enjoy!
