Title: Potatoes Gremolada
Categories: Potato
Yield: 6 servings
- unpeeled and quartered
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1    Stick unsalted butter;
- room temperature
1 ts Kosher salt
1 sm Lemon
1 c  Flat-leaf parsley
- leaves; loosely packed
1 md Garlic clove
2 lb Small red potatoes;
1)  Using a sharp vegetable peeler, cut away the zest of the lemon in
strips, taking care not to include any of the bitter white pith. On a
cutting board finely chop the zest with the parsley and garlic. 2)
Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan and add enough water to cover
them by 1 inch.  Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to
moderately high and cook the potatoes until tender, approximately 15
minutes. 3) Drain the potatoes in a colander and return them to the
sauce pan. Using a potato masher, mash potatoes over a very low heat,
gradually incorporating the heavy cream and the butter.  Stir in the
salt and the gremolada and serve immediately.
