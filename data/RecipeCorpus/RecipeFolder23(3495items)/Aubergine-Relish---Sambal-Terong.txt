2 sm Aubergines
1 lg Spanish onion
4    Cloves garlic
1 tb Vegetable oil
This is a relish which can be used hot or cold.

Slice the aubergine and sprinkle it with salt; leave to stand for
half an hour, then rinse and dry. Cut up the tomatoes and remove the
seeds.

Crush the terasi and garlic together. Slice the onion thinly, and fry
until slightly brown. Add the garlic and terasi, the sugar and the
chilli powder. Put in the aubergine, and mix well. Add the tomatoes,
cover the pan, and continue cooking gently for 5 minutes. Taste, and
add salt if necessary. Then put the mixture into a pudding basin and
steam it for 20 minutes.

If you want this relish to be really hot--spicy hot--then take 4 green
chillis, seed them and chop finely, and put them into the frying-pan
at the same time as the onions. Alternatively, use dried red chillis:
soak them for at least 15 minutes and put them into the mixture,
whole, when everything goes into the basin for steaming.
