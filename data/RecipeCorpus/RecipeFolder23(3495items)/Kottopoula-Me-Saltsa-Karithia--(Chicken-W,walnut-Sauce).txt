Categories: Poultry, Main dish, Greek, Chicken
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  White wine
1 c  Hot water
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
3 ea Fryers (abt. 1 1/2 lb. ea.)
Salt & pepper to taste
1/2 c  Butter or oil
Thoroughly clean and wash chickens.  Truss them, and allow to
drain. Sprinkle lightly with salt & pepper.  Melt the butter in a
frying pan. Brown the chickens, one at a time, well on all sides,
then place them in a wide pot.  Pour in the fat remaining in the
frying pan, and place this pot over heat.  Pour in wine slowly, so it
steams, and add water.  Cover. Simmer, adding more water if needed,
for abt. 30 min.  When chickens are tender, remove from heat & cool
partially, then cut into quarters.  Add walnuts to the sauce, stir,
and bring the sauce to a boil.  Cook for 2 to 3 min. longer.  Add the
quartered chix, and serve hot with fried potatoes and a raw salad.
