From: Larry Haftl

Put warm water and yeast in large mixing bowl and let stand 5
minutes. Then blend in oils, corn meal and first 2 cups of flour.
When well blended, mix in the remaining 3 cups of flour, form into a
ball and then knead for 5 to 10 minutes on a well floured board. This
dough is a bit moist and the initial flour on the board is absorbed
might tend to cling to the board. Don't worry, just knead as best as
possible. After kneading, place on lightly floured board or counter,
cover with a large bowl and let dough rise about 2 hours.

The dough makes about 180 square inches of pizza so use an appropriate
sized 2 inch deep pan (12 x 15 rectangular or 15 inch diameter round
for example.)  Very lightly oil the pan with vegetable oil.  After
the dough has risen, punch down and then arrange in the pan (this
takes a bit of doing as the oiled pan is a bit slippery.) Cover the
bottom of the pan and form a thin (1/4 inch thick) crust all the way
up the sides of the pan. Let the dough rise another 30 minutes.
While its rising, grate your cheese and brown your sausage (you can
do both ahead of time if you want). Lay a nice thick layer of cheese
on the dough (critical as it keeps the juices from getting through to
the crust and turning it into a soggy mess). Then layer on your
sauce, sausage, and finally the mushrooms. Bake in a 375~ oven for 25
to 30 minutes (when edges of crust are a nice golden brown color).
