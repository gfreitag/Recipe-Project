Title: Four Delight Sizzling Rice Soup
Categories: Chinese, Rice, Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Chicken broth
4    2" squares sizzling rice
-(see recipe)
1 c  Sliced fresh mushrooms
1/3 c  Sliced water chestnuts
1/3 c  Frozen green peas, thawed
Salad oil
2 ts Soy sauce
2 ts Dry sherry
2 ts Cornstarch
2    Whole green onions, thinly
-sliced
1/3 lb Boneless lean pork *
Salt
1 ts Sesame oil
* Pork should be cut in matchstick pieces This soup makes a showy
presentation.  At the table you slide fried rice cakes into the soup
to create a crackling, sizzling sound.  Actually, you can add the
rice cakes to almost any soup and give the soup a sizzling name. The
trick is to be sure that both rice cakes and soup are piping hot.

In a bowl, blend soy, sherry and cornstarch.  Add pork and mix until
well coated.  Let stand for ten minutes.  In a 2-quart pan, heat
chicken broth to boiling.  Add pork, stir several times, then reduce
heat and simmer for five minutes.  Add mushrooms, water chestnuts,
and peas. Simmer, uncovered, for 2 minutes.  Add green onion, salt to
taste and sesame oil.

Keep soup hot while you fry sizzling rice cakes per recipe.  Pour hot
soup into a warm tureen and carry to the table.  Bring hot fried rice
cakes to the table in a bowl and immediately slide into the soup.
