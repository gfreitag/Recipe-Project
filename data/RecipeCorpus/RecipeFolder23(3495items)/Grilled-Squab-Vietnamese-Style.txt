4    Squab, about 1 lb. each,
-washed, dried and trimmed
-of fat
1/4 c  Fish sauce or Chinese light
-soy sauce
Slightly sweet, slightly sally, this Asian marinade caramelizes on the
grill. Two Cornish game hens may be substituted for squab. Grill the
split hens for 7 to 8 minutes per side.

Place each squab on its back on a cutting board. With a sharp knife or
poultry shears, split the bird in half through the breast bone. Cut
out the backbone.

In a shallow, non aluminum dish, mix remaining ingredients. Add the
squab, turn to coat evenly, cover and marinate in the refrigerator
for 2 hours or over night. Drain the squab and reserve the marinade.
Prepare a charcoal or gas grill and grill the squab for about 6
minutes. Baste once with reserved marinade; discard marinade. Turn
and cook for about 6 minutes longer, or until the juices run clear
when pierced with a fork.
