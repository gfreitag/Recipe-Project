Title: Schlesisches Himmelreich (Silesian Pork)
Categories: Pork, German
Yield: 4 servings
-pork steaks
2 oz (4 Tbsp) lard or butter
1 lb Dried fruit (prunes,
-apricots, apples, pears)
4    Fine pork chops or 1 lb lean
You will need a medium-sized stewpan with a lid.  Soak the fruit for a
couple of hours - or overnight if possible - in either plain water or
cold tea which will give a darker, richer juice to cover.

Fry the chops in the fat, turning them once, so they take color.  Add
the fruit and the soaking liquid.  Cover and simmer all together for
30 to 35 minutes, or until the fruit is soft and the chops cooked
through.

Serve with potato dumplings.

Serves 4. Time: Start the day before; 10 minutes plus 35 minutes
cooking.
