~-- Lay steaks on a flat surface.  Spread each with mustard; sprinkle
with salt and pepper.  Divide pickles, salt pork (or bacon), and
onion among the steaks equally.  Roll up steaks jelly-roll fashion;
secure with beef roll clamps, toothpicks, or thread.  Heat oil in a
heavy saucepan, add the steak roll, and brown well on all sides,
about 15 minutes.  Pour in hot beef broth, peppercorns, and bay leaf.
Cover and simmer for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Remove beef rolls,
discard clamps, and arrange on a preheated platter.  Blend cornstarch
with a small amount of cold water, stir into gravy and bring to a
boil.  Boil until gravy is thick and bubbly.  Correct seasonings and
serve separately.
