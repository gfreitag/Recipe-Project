-During this part
Ingredients: 1/2 lb. cooked, flaked haddock 2 tbs grated Parmesan
salt and white pepper, to taste    6 eggs 1 tablespoon butter 3 tbs
double cream

Mix the fish and cheese gently, and season lightly with salt and white
pepper. Beat the eggs lightly.  Melt the butter in an omelette pan,
add the eggs and cook until they are nearly done, but still slightly
liquid on top. Spread the fish mixture over the top of the omelette
and pour the cream over it.  Place under a salamander (overhead
broiler) for a few minutes, until the cream begins to bubble, but do
not brown. Without folding the omelette over, slide it onto a warm
platter and serve at once.

Notes: 1. Finnan (or Findon) haddock originated in the village of
Findon, Scotland, just south of Aberdeen.  Other light fleshed fish
which is not too heavily smoked may be substituted. 2. For double
cream, use heavy or whipping cream, but do not whip it. 3. The
British measurements used in this recipe are the same as those in the
US, so no conversion is necessary.
