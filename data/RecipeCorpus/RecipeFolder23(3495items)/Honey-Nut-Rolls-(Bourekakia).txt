MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1    Orange (grated rind only)
1/2 lb Commercial filo sheets
1/2 lb Sweet butter; melted
2 c  Chopped nuts (or more) *
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
2 c  Sugar
1 tb Lemon juice
2 c  Honey
1 c  Water
*Note: Nuts may be walnuts, almonds, pecans, pistachios or any
combination.

Defrost filo to room temperature at least 2 hours before using.  Mix
filling in a bowl and set aside.  Melt butter in a small pan, and
return to heat when it cools and doesn't flow easily while you are
working with filo.

Smooth 3 sheets of filo flat on a cutting board.  With a pastry brush,
dribble warm butter between sheets.  Sprinkle 2/3 cup of nut filling
over top, spreading to corners. Lay another 3 sheets of filo over
filling, buttering between them.  Fold edges over on each side to
keep nuts from rolling out.  Starting with the end nearest to you,
roll away from you as tightly as you can.  Cut into 1" slices.  Place
each roll in oiled pan, next to each other, snugly, nuts facing
upwards.  Continue using all the filo and filling.  When all the
slices are in the pan, dribble a teaspoon of warm butter on top of
each slice.  It will disappear into the layers of nutmeats.

Bake at 350 F for 45 minutes.  Begin making syrup 20 minutes before
the pastry is ready to be taken out of the oven.  Pour hot syrup over
rolls immediately upon removal from oven.  Use a spoon to ladle it
over each one. Set aside to absorb syrup for 4 hours.  Do not
refrigerate.
