Karin Brewer
1/2 ts Saffron threads
2 tb Hot milk
1/3 c  Shelled unsalted pistachios
Soak the saffron in the hot milk for at least 30 minutes. Heat a heavy
frying pan and toast the pistachios with 1 tablespoon of the butter
for 2 minutes, until they are lightly toasted but still green. Remove
as much skin as you can from them and set aside.

Dissolve the sugar in the milk over low heat and keep the mixture
hot. Melt the remaining butter in a heavy saucepan, add the semolina,
and cook, stirring, over low heat for about 8 to 10 minutes.

Stir the saffron milk into the hot sugared milk and add to the
semolina, and cook, stirring vigorously.  Remove the helva from the
fire, cover, and allow to stand in a warm spot for 15 minutes. Fold
in the pistachios and serve warm or at room temperature in bowls.
