Title: Salzburger Nockerln
Categories: Dessert, European
Yield: 4 servings
Zest of 1/2 lemon, grated
Yolks of 4 eggs
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Sifted all purpose flour
4 ts Unsalted butter
4 ts Currant or grape jelly
Whites of 9 large eggs, at
-room temperature
1/2 c  Vanilla sugar
1.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

2.  Place four 9-inch oval au gratin dishes (or one large oval glass
lasagna pan) on a baking sheet.  In each small dish place 1 teaspoon
of butter and 1 teaspoon of jelly.  (If you are using a lasagna pan,
smear the bottom with the butter and then with the jelly.

3.  Combine the egg whites, vanilla sugar, and lemon zest in a large
metal bowl.  Beat with an electric mixer at high speed until stiff
peaks form.

4.  Beat the egg yolks with the granulated sugar.  Gently fold the egg
yolks and flour into the meringue.  Use a spatula to place three large
mounds of the mixture into each au gratin dish. Smooth the surface of
each and bake for 8 minutes, until puffed and golden.

5.  Serve immediately.  This is especially good with Vanilla Sauce,
warm Chocolate Sauce, or cold Strawberry Sauce (recipes separately).

Serves 4.
