Title: Llenguado Amb Ametlles (Sole with Almonds and Cream Sauce
Categories: Fish, European, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
4    Soles, whole
1/4    Lb, toasted almonds
-Salt.
-Flour
1/4 lb Butter
1 c  Heavy cream
Wash and drain the soles, then dredge in flour.  Brown in the butter
over high heat, turning several times.  Reduce the heat so that the
fish will be done in about 20 minutes. Peel and slice the almonds and
add to the fish after it has cooked for about 15 minutes and is not
quite done. After a couple minutes, add the cream and let it reduce
for 3 - 5 minutes. Transfer the fish to a serving dish or individual
plates and cover with the sauce from the pan.

Note:  The soles may be skinned before cooking, or replaced with
skinless and boneless fillets.  [I think they are much better
flavored when cooked whole, with skin and bones intact, but it's a
question of individual preference.]
