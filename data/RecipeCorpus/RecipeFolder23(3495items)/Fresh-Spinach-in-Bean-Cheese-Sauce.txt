mented bean curd with thin soy; mix with stock and sugar.

Stir-frying:  Heat wok to very hot; add oil.  When oil just begins to
smoke, add 1/2 spinach, and toss until it begins to wilt. Push wilted
spinach up side of wok; add remaining spinach, and toss until it
wilts. Push all spinach out of bottom of wok; add chili and ginger;
stir for about 10 seconds. Add liquid ingredients; stir; when liquids
boils, thicken to medium consistency with dribbles of cornstarch
paste. Recombine with spinach. Stir to coat spinach. Serve. Spinach
should remain bright green until you pour in liquid.
