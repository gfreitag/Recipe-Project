Title: Pollo Alla Diavola (Chicken Devil's Style)
Categories: Poultry, Italian, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
2    Lemons
Freshly ground pepper
Salt
2 1/2 lb Chicken, halved
1/2 c  Olive oil
3    Dried red chilies, stemmed
- and seeded
On a stove burner, heat the olive oil in a small pan over medium heat.
Add the chili pods and saute them until they are a deep, dark brown.
Turn off the heat and cool the olive oil and throw away the browned
chilies. (the alternative is to add Tabasco sauce to the oil to make
it hot without cooking it) Crack the leg and wing joints of the
chickens loose and spread them out, skin side up on a board or clean
counter. Pound the chickens will with a meat mallet to flatten them
out. Add the juice of 1 of the lemons to the seasoned olive oil along
with 3 or 4 twists of pepper. Put the chicken halves in a big bowl,
pour the seasoned olive oil over them and turn the peices over and
over to coat them well. Let the chicken stand for 1 - 2 hours,
turning the halves from time to time. Start your charcoal grill. When
your grill is heaped high with hot coals, put the marinated chicken
halves on to cook, skin side down. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and
a little more pepper, grill thoroughly, turning and basting with the
remaining marinade.  The chicken is done when it is tender and has a
dark brown crust all over (some spots may well be charred) You can
use the broiler in your oven, but an oven broiler never seems to get
hot enough. If you want to try, preheat the broiler, put the chicken
as close to the flame or coil as possible and broil it, turning it
frequently and basting it often.  Serve chicken hot with lemon
wedges. From Time Life - The Good Cook ~ Poultry
