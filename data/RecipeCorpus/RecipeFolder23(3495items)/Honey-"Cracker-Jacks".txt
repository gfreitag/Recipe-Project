Title: Honey "Cracker Jacks"
Categories: Snack, Popcorn
Yield: 6 servings
6 c  Popped popcorn
1 c  Shelled peanuts
1/2 c  Honey
1/2 c  Margarine
Heat honey and margarine in a saucepan until well blended. Cool.
Combine popcorn and peanuts in a large bowl.  Pour honey mix over
popcorn, stirring as you pour.  When popcorn and peanuts are well
coated, spread in a pan in a single layer. Bake at 350 degrees for 5
to 10 minutes or until crisp but not brown, stirring several times.
The difference between crisp (not brown) and burnt can be a matter of
minutes.  Keep in an air tight container.

My Note:  This doesn't really taste like cracker jacks but it was sure
good.  I'll use more popcorn next time as the popcorn really soaked
the honey butter up fast and some was positively soggy.
