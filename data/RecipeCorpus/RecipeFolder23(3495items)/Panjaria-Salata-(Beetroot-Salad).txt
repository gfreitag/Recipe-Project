Wash beetroot well, cut off tops, leaving about 3 cm (1 1/4 inches) on
beetroot.  Select the tender, undamaged leaves of the beetroot,
discarding remainder.  Boil beetroot in salted water to cover until
tender - about 30-45 minutes.  Boil tops separately in salted water
for 15 minutes.

Peel beetroot and slice or cube into a bowl.  Drain tops and add to
bowl if desired, or leave in a separate bowl.

Either serve at room temperature with Skorthalia, or mix dressing
ingredients, pour over hot beetroot and leaves and allow to cool
before serving.
