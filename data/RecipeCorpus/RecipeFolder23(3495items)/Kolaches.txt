Categories: Bread, European
Yield: 36 servings
1 ts Salt

1/4 ts Lemon juice
1 1/2 tb Butter
1/2 lb Apricots, dried

Dough:  In a large saucepan, scald milk and add sugar, egg, butter,
and salt.  Cool mixture to 115-120 F.  In a large bowl, dissolve
yeast in warm milk mixture.  Add flour gradually and knead to a very
soft dough.  Cover and let rise until doubled in size--about one
hour.  Shape dough into balls about 2" in diameter.  Place on greased
baking sheets 2" apart. Cover and let rise again until doubled--about
30 to 45 minutes.  When they have risen, make an indention in the
center of each roll.  Fill each with desired filling and bake at 350
F. for 20 to 25 minutes.

Filling:  In a large saucepan, cover apricots with water and cook
until plump and tender (about 20 minutes).  Drain and place in a
blender or food processor and puree.  In a saucepan, combine puree
with sugar, lemon juice, and butter.  Cook over medium heat until
butter has melted.
