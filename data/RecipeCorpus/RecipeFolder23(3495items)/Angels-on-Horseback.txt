Title: Angels on Horseback
Categories: Seafood, Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
Paprika
Toothpicks
Bacon slices
Oysters, fresh, raw
Salt and pepper
Wrap thin slices of bacon around freshly shucked oysters, sprinkled
with salt, pepper and paprika, and secure them with wooden picks. Put
them on a rack in a shallow baking pan and brown them slowly in a
moderate oven (350F), turning once, until the bacon is crisp. Serve
hot, on parsley sprigs or watercress. Angels on horseback may also be
browned under the broiler.  They should be turned to crisp the bacon
on all sides. Source: Gourmet Cookbook, Volume 1
