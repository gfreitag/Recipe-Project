Put very ripe unpeeled bananas in a plastic bag in the freezer.
Remove as needed to make this easy blender drink or dessert:

Remove 1 banana from the freezer and allow it to defrost just enough
to remove the peel.  Cut the partly-thawed, peeled banana into chunks
and put it in the blender or food processor with a few drops of
vanilla extract and coconut flavoring.  Add skim milk or low-fat
yogurt and blend smooth. A small amount of milk or yogurt will create
a "frozen custard."  Add more milk or yogurt for a milkshake.  Add a
whole egg for a high-protein instant breakfast or lunch. (Top with a
dash of cinnamon or nutmeg, if desired.)

Skim milk has approximately 45 calories per 1/2 cup; plain low-fat
yogurt, calories.
