Title: Homemade Playdough
Categories: Kids
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Cream of tartar
1 tb Oil
1 c  Flour
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Salt
Cook this stuff until it forms a mess, excuse me, mass in the pan.
Turn it out on a plate, pick an old one, and cover it with a damp
cloth, also and old one.  Food coloring may be added. Store playdough
in the refrigerator but do me a favor......don't EAT the stuff.
