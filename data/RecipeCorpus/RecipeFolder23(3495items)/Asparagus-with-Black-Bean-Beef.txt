Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil over high heat, add 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Stir in asparagus.  Add 1/4 cup water.  Cover pan for 2 minutes, and

Over high heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil.  Stir-fry the RINSED black

Stir-fry quickly until barely.  Do not overcook or the beef will

soy sauce.  Stir in asparagus.

Add gravy mixture.  Stir until thickened.  Serve hot.
