Categories: Italian, Poultry, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Chopped capers
4 oz Stock, chicken or beef
4 oz White wine
2 oz Brandy
6 oz Heavy cream
Salt & pepper
1 tb Chopped parsley
4    Chicken breasts, skinned and
-de-boned
2 tb Flour
2 tb Oil
2 tb Butter
4    Green onions
1 tb Chopped tarragon (or 1 tsp
-dry)
Servings: 4 Notes: "I name this recipe for the beautiful and
fascinating Cleopatra. I would have liked to serve this dish to her
as she sailed down the Nile on her barge to "caper" with Anthony."

DIRECTIONS: Heat the oil and butter in a large frypan. Dredge the
chicken in the flour and saute for 3 minutes on each side. Add the
green onions, tarragon, capers and cook for 5 more minutes. Pour in
the wine, stock, brandy and cream and simmer for 5 minutes. Season
with salt and pepper. Serve over rice or pasta with chopped parsley
on top. (My notes: after adding & cooking the green onions, etc,
remove the chicken from the pan. Add the brandy first, and simmer
until reduced by about half. Then add the wine and beef stock and
reduce slightly. Add the cream and return the chicken to the pan-
simmering 5 minutes as above.)
