This paste can be used as a marinade or rub for any meat, poultry, or
fish, or as a base for a sauce.

Place the coconut into a food processor and blend until the
consistency of a paste.

Saute the onion and garlic in 2 Tablespoons of the peanut oil.
Remove and add to the coconut.

Add all the remaining ingredients to the coconut mixture and process,
while slowly adding enough of the oil to form a paste.
