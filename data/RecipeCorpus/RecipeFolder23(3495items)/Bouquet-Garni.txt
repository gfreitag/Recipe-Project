Comments:

A bundle of aromatic herbs and vegetables, bouquet garni is used to
flavor soups, stocks, poaching liquids, stews, and braised dishes.
It is always removed after cooking.  The herbs are tied together with
a string or gathered together in a cheesecloth bag to facilitate
their retrieval from the finished dish.  Traditional bouquet garni
herbs include bay leaf, thyme, and parsley, although other herbs and
vegetables such as tarragon, chervil, peppercorns, celery, and leeks
may be included to enhance the flavor of a particular dish.
