Title: Dippy Snacks
Categories: Kids, Dip
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Cottage cheese
1    Stick (1/2 cup) butter or
-margarine, softened
With carrots, celery, green pepper strips, cucumber slices, cherry
tomatoes, cauliflower pieces or crackers, try any of the following:

CHEESE SPREAD

garlic powder

Blend shortening with cottage cheese. A blender or baby food grinder
will give you a smoother consistency than whipping with a fork. Add
garlic powder to taste. Refrigerate in a covered container.

DIP IT AGAIN

1 (8 oz) container of plain yogurt 1 cup sour cream 1 pkg onion soup
mix

Combine and chill before serving.

BETTER-WITH-BUTTERMILK DIP

1 cup buttermilk 2 cups mayonnaise 1 cup sour cream or yogurt 1
envelope Ranch style dressing mix

Stir together and chill. For use as salad dressing, substitute a
second cup of buttermilk for the sour cream or yogurt.

Hint: Use cucumber "coins" instead of crackers.

OTHER QUICK DIPPIES that make up in small quantities:

* Blend 1/3 to 1/2 of a mashed banana with 2 or 3 tsps of mayonnaise.

* Whipe together 1 tsp of smooth peanut butter with 1 tsp of
mayonnaise. If still too thick, add a few drops of milk.

* Mix 1/2 tsp of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of honey or sugar to 1 or 2
tsp of mayonnaise.

CUTTING UP WITH KIDS

Have your children help you cut up green onions, parsley, lettuce,
cheese slices, fruit, etc., using a scissors instead of a knife.
Using a scissors helps coordination (YES!) and keeps them busy for a
_long_ time!

CHERRY BALLS

Stuff whole (or half) cherry tomatoes with cream cheese, a cheese
spread, egg salad or tuna salad.

Actually thinking of snacks as hors d'oeuvres - rather than desserts
~ will open up a whole new way of looking at this category.
