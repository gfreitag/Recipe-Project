they are eaten all over Italy.

Heat milk with a pinch of salt, and when it boils gradually add
semolina, stirring the whole time with a wooden spoon to avoid lumps.

tablespoons butter in small pieces.  then gradually stir in 2
tablespoons parmesan cheese, the egg yolk, one at a time, a pinch of
pepper and nutmeg. Oil 1 or 2 large dishes or clean marble kitchen
slab and pour semolina mixture on. Spread out to 1/2-inch thickness
using a cold wet spatula and allow to cool.

Preheat oven to 350 degree F (175 degree C).  Melt remaining 6
tablespoons butter; use some of butterÂ to grease the casserole you
want to cook and serve gnocchi in. Cut out squares ot circles of
semolina dough and place in greased dish. Drizzle with butter and
sprinkle with parmesan, add a second layer of gnocchi, and so on.
Sprinkle breadcrumbs over gnocchi and bake for about 20 minutes or
until golden brown.
