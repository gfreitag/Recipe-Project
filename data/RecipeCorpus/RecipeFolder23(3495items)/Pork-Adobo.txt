Title: Pork Adobo
Categories: Pork, Asian
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Fresh ground black pepper
1 1/2 c  Water
1    Bay leaf
1 1/2 lb Boneless pork, in 1-in cubes
1/2 c  Rice vinegar
6    Cloves garlic, minced
3 tb Soy sauce, or fish sauce
1.  In a bowl combine pork cubes, vinegar, garlic, soy sauce, and
pepper; marinate 1 to 3 hours in the refrigerator.
2.  Transfer all ingredients to a non-aluminum saucepan, add 1 cup of
the water and bay leaf, and bring to a boil, uncovered.  Adjust heat
so meat cooks at a lively simmer but does not boil too rapidly.
3.  Cook until liquid is nearly gone, then reduce heat further.
Mixture will sizzle and pop as the last bits of water evaporate; then
the pork cubes will begin to brown in the remaining fat.  Turn cubes
to brown evenly and remove from heat if mixture shows signs of
scorching. 4.  Remove pork cubes to serving dish.  Add 1/2 cup of the
water to pan and bring to a boil, stirring to scrape browned bits
from pan.  Pour over pork.  Serve with rice.

Variation:  Follow Pork Adobo recipe.  Use a mixture of chicken, cut
into braising pieces (1 to 2 inches with bones), and boneless pork.
Cook only until liquid is reduced 1/2 cup, then brown meats in a
separate pan:  In large skillet, add 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
(enough to coat bottom of pan).  Heat oil over medium-high heat and
brown chicken and pork pieces well.  Transfer browned meats to a warm
platter and cover with sauce.

Comments:

The famous adobo is a classic dish of the Philippines.  Like the
curries of other countries, adobo probably originated as a way of
preserving meat. In this case the preserving agent is vinegar, not
chiles or other spices. This version calls for boiling cubes of pork
in vinegar and garlic mixture until the liquid evaporates and the
cubes begin to fry in their own rendered fat.  Use pork with some
visible fat, either from the shoulder or the nearby section of the
loin (usually sold as "country-style+ spareribs).
