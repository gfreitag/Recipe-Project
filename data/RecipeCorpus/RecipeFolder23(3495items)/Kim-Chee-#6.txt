3    Garlic cloves; minced
4 ts Fresh ginger, minced
1 tb Dried chili flakes
2 ts Soy sauce/tamari
1 c  Water
2/3 lb Napa Cabbage
1/2 lb Daikon radish
1 md Cucumber
1 md Turnip
1/2 c  Salt
1 tb Salt
Peel daikon, cucumber and turnip, and slice 1/4" thick.

Layer whole cabbage leaves, sliced daikon, cucumber and turnip in a
large bowl. Between layers, liberally sprinkle with 1/2 cup salt.
Cover with water and place a wide plate or pot on top to submerge
them. Leave overnight or at least 12 hours. Drain & Rinse vegetables
in a colander. Julienne each vegetable into a uniform shape. return
them to the large bowl, and add spring onions, garlic, ginger, chili
flakes, soy/tamari, salt and 1 cup water. Toss to combine.

Spoon the vegetabels with liquid into a large crock or clean jars.
Cover tightly or cap. Refridgerate for 3 days before opening.
Everyday, turn jars upside down a couple of times to distribute
spices, or stir vegetables in the crock. Store in refridgerator.

Notes: Kim chee spiciness varies depending on the hotness of the chili
flakes used. The longer it sites, the hotter it gets (up to a point).
I cannot vouch for the authenticity of the recipe, but its about as
close as I've come.

beware 'kim chee' spices in oriental food stores, as they most likely
have MSG in them.
