Title: Ofennudle (Rohrnudle)
Categories: German
Yield: 4 servings
500 g  Apples, damson plums, or
-pitted cherries (a generous
Lb)
Sugar to taste (nowadays
-also vanilla sugar)
A little cinnamon (with
-apples or damson plums)
400 g  Butter or clarified butter
-(1 3/4 cups) for baking
500 g  Flour (4 1/2 cups less 1
-Tbsp)
1 ds Salt
40 g  [fresh] yeast (1.4 oz)
80 g  Sugar (1/3 cup plus 1 tsp)
1    To 2 eggs
70 g  Butter (1/3 cup less 1 tsp)
1/8 l  Milk (1/2 cup plus 1/2 Tbsp)
Filling:
Yeast dough:

Dissolve the yeast and some sugar in a bit of warmed milk. Mound the
flour on a pastry board.  Make a well in the middle of the mound, and
into it pour the yeast mixture.  Let rest for about 1/2 hour.  Then
add the remaining ingredients - sugar, eggs, salt, butter, and milk.
Knead to mix well, and beat until the dough forms bubbles.  Cover the
dough with an inverted bowl and let rise, in a warm place, for 1 1/2
hours.  Then cut off lumps of dough, and let those rise one more
time, on the floured pastry board, for another 1/2 hour.  With your
hands, stretch each piece of dough and cover with fruit (one kind
only).  If you are using apples or damson plums, dust fruit with
cinnamon and sugar, otherwise just with sugar.  Fold the dough over
to enclose the fruit and arrange the dumplings in a baking dish with
a buttered bottom (3 1/2 Tbsp butter per dumpling) .  Bake at medium
heat for 35 to 40 minutes, until light brown.  Remove from oven and
tip onto a board for cooling.  Brush with melted butter shortly
before cooling.

Serves 4.
