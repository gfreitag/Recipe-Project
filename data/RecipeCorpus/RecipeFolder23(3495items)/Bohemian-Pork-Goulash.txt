1.  Sprinkle pork strips on all sides with salt and pepper.  In a
large, heavy frying pan over medium-high heat, melt butter with oil;
add pork strips, about half at a time and brown well on all sides,
removing them as they brown.  When all pork is browned, spoon off all
but about 2 tablespoons of the pan drippings (if necessary).
2.  Add onions and cook, stirring often, until rings are soft and
begin to brown.  Mix in garlic, paprika, caraway seed, and dill seed.
Return pork strips (along with any accumulated juices) to pan.  Add
bay leaf.  Pour in stock and wine.  Bring to boil, cover, reduce
heat, and simmer until pork is tender (40 to 50 minutes).
3.  Remove and discard bay leaf.  Blend in cornstarch mixture and
cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens.  Remove pan from heat
and blend in sour cream.
4.  Return to low heat and stir gently until heated through.  Do not
boil. Taste and add salt if needed.  Sprinkle with parsley.
