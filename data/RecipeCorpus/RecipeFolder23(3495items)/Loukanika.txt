Categories: Greek, Meat
Yield: 20 servings
1 ts Crushed dried marjoram
-OR- thyme
1    Bay leaf; ground in a mortar
1/3 c  Dry red wine
1 ts Ground allspice or coriander
-OR- both
Freshly ground black pepper
2    Garlic cloves; crushed
Sausage casing
Karen Mintzias
1 lb Lean pork shoulder, ground
1/2 lb Fresh pork rind
-- boiled for 2 hours,
-- drained, and ground
1/2 lb Pork fatback, ground
1 ts Salt
1    Navel orange
-- grated rind only
Grind the pork, pork rind, and fatback through the fine blade of a
meat chopper.  Combine in a large bowl with all the seasonings.  Knead
thoroughly.  Store in the refrigerator while you prepare the casing.

Ususally salted, the casing (pork intestine) especially the interior,
must be rinsed under cold running water several times.  (To avoid
losing casing down the drain while doing this, be sure the casing is
inside a very large pan!)  Allow to drain on a linen towel.

Use a pastry bag to force the stuffing into the casing.  Pinch at
3-1/2 to 4 inch intervals allowing space between to form the sausage
links. Normally the casing will not break, but if it does, that
section must be discarded and a knot tied in the new "end".  To cook,
poach in water for 1 hour, then drain, discarding the cooking water.
Fry the sausages in a frying pan over moderate heat, or use as
suggested in any recipe.  Drain and serve hot.

Note: To store, freeze uncooked in meal-sized batches.  The sausages
should be used within a day or two if not frozen.
