and the nutmeg.  Set aside.  Mix the flour, and 1/2 tsp salt in a
large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour. Beat the tomato
paste, oil and eggs until well blended and pour into the well in the
flour. Stir with a fork gradually bring the flour mixture to the
center of the bowl. Do this until the dough makes a ball. If the
dough is too dry, mix in up to 2 tbls of water.  Knead lightly on a
floured cloth-covered surface, adding flour if dough is sticky, until
smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover and let rest for another 5
minutes. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts. Roll the dough, one
part at a time, into a rectangle about 12 X 10-inches. (Keep the rest
of the dough covered.) Drop the pumpkin mixture by 2 level tsps onto
half of the rectangle, about 1 1/2-inches apart in 2 rows of 4 mounds
each. Moisten the edges of the dough and the dough between the rows
of pumpkin mixture with water. Fold the other half of the dough up
over the pumpkin mixture, pressing the dough down around the pumpkin.
Trim the edges with a pastry wheel or knife. Cut between the rows of
filling to make ravioli; press the edges together with a fork or cut
with a pastry wheel sealing the edges well. Repeat with the remaining
dough and pumpkin filling. Place ravioli on towel, let stand turning
once, until dry, about 30 minutes. Prepare the Pumpkin Seed Sauce.
Heat until hot; reserve keeping it warm. Cook ravioli in 4 quarts of
boiling salted water (2 tsp of salt) until tender, about 10 to 15
minutes; drain carefully. Serve the ravioli with the warm Pumpkin
Seed Sauce spooned over.
