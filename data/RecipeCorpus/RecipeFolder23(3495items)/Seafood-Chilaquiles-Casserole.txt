~-- Heat oil in a 10-inch skillet until hot.  Cook tortilla strips in
the hot oil until they are light golden brown, about 30 to 60 seconds
and then drain.  Set aside.  Cook onions in margarine in a 3-quart
sauce pan over low heat until tender, then stir in the flour, salt
and pepper.  Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is bubbly.
Remove from heat, stir in half & half (light cream).  Heat to
boiling, stirring constantly.  Boil and stir for 1 minute, then
reduce the heat.  Stir in remaining ingredients except the bacon.
Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, just until the shrimp are
pink, about 9 minutes.  Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Layer half of
the tortilla strips in the bottom of a greased 3-quart casserole; top
with half of the seafood mixture.  Repeat with remaining tortilla
strips and seafood mixture; top with the bacon.  Bake until hot, 15
to 20 minutes.
