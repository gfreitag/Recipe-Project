Title: Filled Tortillas
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
4    Jalapenos chopped fine
1/4    -1/2 tsp chili powder
3/4 ts Seasoning salt
6    Flour tortillas
-Salsa (optional)
16 oz Cream cheese (softened)
1 1/2 tb Chopped black olives
Mix softened (can be done in the microwave) cream cheese, olives,
jalipinos, chili powder, and seasoning salt. Spread a thin layer on
tortilla going all the way out to the edges. Roll tortilla. Repeat
for each tortilla. At this point you can either put them in a plastic
bag in the refrigerator and save until you are ready to serve them,
or serve immediately. (Sometimes I warm them for a few seconds in the
microwave to soften, other times I serve cold). Cut into 1/2" slices
before serving. Can be dipped into salsa.
