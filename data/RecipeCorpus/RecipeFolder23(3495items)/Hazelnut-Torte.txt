Beat the egg yolks and sugar until very light, about 5 minutes.
Slowly add the water.  Sift the flour and baking powder together.
Mix with 1 cup of nuts.  Fold the flour mixture into the egg yolks.
Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Gently fold the beaten
whites into the batter. Pour into a greased and floured 10-inch
springform pan.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes or until cake
is done.  Cool cake on a wire rack. When completely cooled, split the
cake into 2 layers.  Fold the vanilla, confectioners' sugar, and
remaining 1/2 cup of nuts into the whipped cream. Spread whipped
cream between the 2 cake layers and on top of the cake. Chill until
serving time.  Garnish with fresh strawberries, if desired. *
Hazelnuts are available at most stores under the name of Filberts.
They should be blanched.  To blanch, boil the nuts for 5 minutes and
when they are cool enough to handle, remove the skins.  To grind,
place about 1/4 cup at a time in a blender, or chop as finely as you
can with a sharp knife.
