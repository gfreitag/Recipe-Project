Title: Puliszka - Polenta with Feta Cheese
Categories: European
Yield: 6 servings
4 oz Feta cheese
8 oz Sour cream
1 tb Dill, chopped
1 c  Corn meal, polenta
2 c  Water
4 oz Butter
Cook Polenta in slightly salted water. Add butter. Stir it well. When
all water disappeared, add feta cheese and sour cream but do not stir
to well, and do not cook it anymore. The cheese and the sour cream
should not be blended in the polenta, but vaguely mixed in. Before
serving heat it up in the oven, sprinkle freshly chopped dill on top.
This is a delicious dish!

You can also top it with fried onions: slice large purple or white
onions in thin rings, fry them without anything in hot oil or butter
until dark brown and crisp, drain it, salt it and sprinkle on the
polenta.
