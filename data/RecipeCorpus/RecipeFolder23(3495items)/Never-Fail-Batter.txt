Title: Never Fail Batter
Categories: Seafood, Dip
Yield: 6 servings
2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Oil
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Cornstarch
1 c  Water
Mix all of the ingredients together and blend until there are no
lumps. Preheat the oil in your deep fat fryer to the proper
temperature for the food you are cooking.

Dry the fish or the vegetables with a paper towel and dip into the
batter. Place in the hot oil one piece at a time. Try to keep the
pieces from colliding until the batter has had a chance to set (which
it does almost instantly).

Cook until the batter has turned a golden brown, remove to a paper
towel to drain and serve at once. This is very good to use for
zucchini, broccoli, peppers, green beans, onion rings and any other
firm vegetable.
