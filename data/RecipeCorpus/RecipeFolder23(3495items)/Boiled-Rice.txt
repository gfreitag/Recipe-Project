Title: Boiled Rice
Categories: Chinese, Rice
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Salt
Freshly ground pepper
1 c  Long-grain white rice
- (uncooked)
2 c  Chicken broth or water
PUT RICE AND WATER or broth in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan, and bring to
a boil. Stir once or twice. Lower heat to a simmer. Cover with a
tight-fitting lid or heavy-duty foil and cook 15 minutes. If the rice
is not quite tender or the liquid is not absorbed, replace lid and
cook 2 to 4 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper. Fluff with a
fork. To reheat, place in a colander over boiling water, making sure
the water does not boil into or soak the rice, but only steams it.
The rice will stay fluffy as long as the water doesn't evaporate. In
restaurants it is kept this way for hours. Cover the rice to prevent
the top layer from drying out.

TIPS: For drier rice, use 2 tablespoons less water.
