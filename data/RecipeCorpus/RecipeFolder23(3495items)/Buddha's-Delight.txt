bean curd sticks overnight; soak rest about 1 hour.  Cut bean curd
sticks and lily buds into 2" sections.  Remove hard stems from wood
ears, and slice thinly.  Remove stems from black mushrooms (reserve
for stock pot); halve the caps.  Cut thin strands of bamboo shoots
into 2" lengths. Cut soaked bean thread noodles into 3" pieces.

Wash and blanch bean sprouts, celery and pepper.Slice celery, pepper,
carrots, turnip and cabbage into 2" long pencil-size pieces.  Halve
baby corn on the bias.

Slice pressed bean curd same size as vegetables.  Deep-fry in shallow
oil until slightly tan but still pliable.  Drain.

Mash fermented bean curd, then blend with sugar, dark soy, sherry and
water.

Stir-frying:  Heat wok until medium-hot.  Add 4 tablespoons of deep-
frying oil.  Add all dry ingredients, except noodles; stir-fry 1
minute. Turn wok to high.  Add fresh and canned ingredients, and
stir-fry for 2 more minutes: sprinkle in salt after first minute.
Add liquid mixture, mixing with juices in pan.  Add noodles.  Reduce
heat to medium, cover wok, and steam for 5 minutes, or until
vegetables are cooked but still firm. Uncover, sprinkle in MSG and
sesame oil.  Toss briefly. Serve in a warm bowl.
