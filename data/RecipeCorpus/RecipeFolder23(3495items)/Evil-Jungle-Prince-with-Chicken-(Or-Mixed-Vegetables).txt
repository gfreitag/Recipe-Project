Title: Evil Jungle Prince with Chicken (Or Mixed Vegetables)
Categories: Thai, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Oil
1/2 c  Coconut milk
2 tb Fish sauce
15    Basil leaves
1 c  Chopped cabbage
1/2 lb Boneless chicken breast or:
1/2 lb Mixed vegetables
4    Small red chile peppers
1/2    Stalk lemon grass
2    Kaffir lime leaves
thinly cut chicken into 2-inch strips.  If doing veggie version, cut
veggies into thin strips.  Grind together red chili peppers, lemon
grass, and kaffir lime leaves.  Heat oil and saute pepper mixture for
three minutes.  Stir in coconut milk and cook for two minutes.  Add
chichen (or vegetables) and cook for five minutes of until cooked.
Reduce heat to medium-low.   Stir in fish sauce and basil.  Serve on
bed of chopped cabbage.

Note:  For mixed vegetables, choose from amoung bell peppers, string
beands, water chestnuts, tomatoes ( small cherry tomatoes are best),
bamboo shoots, nimiature corn, asparagus, cucumbers, zucchini,
Japanese eggplant, and mushrooms.  I particularly like string beans
or asparagus, a few cherry tomatoes, shredded (rather than sliced)
bamboo shoots, miniature corn, and stome straw mushrooms or slender
(Japanese) eggplant.
