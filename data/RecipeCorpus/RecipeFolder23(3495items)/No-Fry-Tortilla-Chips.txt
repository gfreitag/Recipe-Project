Title: No-Fry Tortilla Chips
Categories: Appetizer, Diabetic, Vegetarian, Tex/mexican
Yield: 6 servings
-10-inch size
Salt (optional)
1 pk Corn Tortillas (12 ounces)
--or-
1 pk Flour Tortillas (14 ounces),
A delicious low-fat, low-sodium alternative to conventional corn
chips. They go especially well with Guacamole and Spicy Salsa (see
separate recipes).

Immerse tortillas one at a time in water.  Let drain briefly, then lay
flat.

If desired, sprinkle tops lightly with salt.

Cut each tortilla into 6 to 8 wedges.

Cover a nonstick baking sheet with a single layer of tortilla wedges,
salt side up.  Place close together but do not overlap.

Bake in a 500 F oven for 4 minutes.  Turn with a spatula; then
continue to bake until golden brown and crisp, an additional 3
minutes for corn tortillas and 1 minute for flour tortillas. (Store
in an airtight bag until ready to serve.)

Yield: 6 servings, 12 cups
