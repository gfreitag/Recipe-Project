Title: Sandy Williams's Tortas De Papa  (Potato Cake
Categories: Potato
Yield: 32 servings
2    Eggs
3 T  Vegetable oil
Salsa
8 md Baking potatoes
Salt
1/2 c  Feta cheese, crumbled
Boil the potatoes for 15 minutes or until well cooked; drain, when
cool enough to handle, but not cold, peel them. In a large bowl, mash
them, add salt to taste and mix thoroughly. Set aside. Using a
blender, coarsely chop the cheese. Combine the potatoes and cheese,
mixing well, using your fingers.  Add eggs and continue mixing by
hand until the mixture is smooth. Taste and add salt if necessary.
Heat some of the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Scoop out a
little bit of the potato mixture (aobut 2 tablespoons) and pat out a
small cake with your fingers, flipping it gently from hand to hand
until it is a uniform shape, about 3 inches in diameter and about 1/2
inch thick. Place the potato cake in the hot oil and saute for about
3-4 minutes. Remove from the pan and drain it on a paper towel. After
patting out each cake, dip your fingers in a bowl of water so the
next one will not stick and add some oil to the frying pan after each
batch. Stack the drained potato cakes on a platter in a warm oven
until ready to serve. (To store, wrap them in foil and refrigerate.
Reheat by placing the foil package in a moderate over for 15 - 20
minutes. They are not crisp on the outside when reheated, but still
tasty)

Serve with salsa.
