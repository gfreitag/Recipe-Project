Unlike most other Thai curries, jungle Curry is made without coconut
milk because coconuts don't grow in the jungles of northern Thailand.
The curry paste is hot and full of flavor. Kaffir lime leaves give
this curry its distinctive and enticing flavor, but if they are not
available, you can substitute grated lime Zest.

Cut pork in half lengthwise and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Set
aside. In a large, nonstick skillet or wok, heat oil over medium-high
heat. Add garlic and stir-fry for 2 minutes, or until browned. Add
curry paste and cook for 30 seconds, pressing it against the sides
and bottom of the skillet or wok.  Add pork and stir-fry for 2 to 3
minutes, or until light brown.  Add stock and bring to a boil. Add
eggplant, beans, fish sauce, krachai (if using) and lime leaves or
zest, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the vegetables are
tender. If using lime leaves, discard them. Remove from heat and stir
in basil. Serve with sticky rice.

Serves 4 as a main dish or 6 in combination with other dishes.
