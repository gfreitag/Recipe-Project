Title: Vidalia Onion Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
2 cn Water
1 c  Shredded mozzerella cheese
Slices hard Italian Bread
4    Vidalia Onions, sliced
1    Stick margarine or butter
1 cn Chicken broth
1 cn Beef broth
Saute onions in margarine for 20 minutes, add broths and water and let
simmer another 20-30 minutes. Put one slice of bread in each bowl,
sprinkle with 2-3 Tbs cheese. Ladle soup over the top. It melts the
cheese, no broiler hassle and it tastes as good as any I have had
out! (I must confess, we did use the butter, grin, but it probably
would taste good with the margarine).
