Title: Kolache Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie, European
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 lb Ground walnuts
1    Egg white, beaten
1 c  Sugar or honey
1/2 ts Almond extract
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
2 c  Flour
8 oz Cream cheese
1/2 lb Butter
1    Egg
2 ts Sugar
Nut Filling
Sift the flour and sugar together. Work in the butter, cream cheese
and egg. Knead together. And easy way to do this is to put the dough
inside a plastic bag - much less messy! Let the dough stand in the
refrigerator overnight. About a half hour before you're ready to
start making the cookies, put the dough into the freezer.

For the filling, mix all of the above ingredients together.  You can
also used canned poppy seed filling (Solo brand) or an apricot or
prune filling.

Spread flour and powdered sugar onto the surface where you will be
rolling the dough. Roll the dough out thin. Cut into squares about 2
inches on each side.  It's easiest to cut if you use a pizza cutter.
Spread a small amount of filling (1/2 to 1 tsp) from one corner to
the opposite corner. Don't fill them too much, or the filling will
spill out when it is cooking. Fold the two remaining corners to the
center, partially covering the filling. Wet your fingertip in a small
bowl of water, and seal the edge, or it may open up during the
cooking.

Bake in a 375 degree oven for about 13 minutes.

Makes 6 dozen small cookies.
