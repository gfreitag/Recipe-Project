Wash spinach well and cut off any coarse stems. Chop coarsely and put
into a pan.  Cover and place over heat for 7-8 minutes shaking pan
now and then or turning spinach so that juices can run out freely.
Drain well in colander, pressing occasionally with a spoon.

Gently fry onion in oil for 10 minutes, add spring onion and fry for
further 5 minutes.

Place drained spinach with onion-oil mixture in a large mixing bowl.
Add herbs, nutmeg, cheeses and eggs and stir to combine.  Check
saltiness of mixture, then add salt and pepper to taste.

Brush a 25 x 30 cm (10 x 12 inch) baking dish with butter and line
with a sheet of fillo pastry.  Top with another 4 sheets, brushing
each with butter.  Spread filling in pastry-lined dish and top with
remaining fillo, brushing each sheet again with butter.  Trim edges
if necessary and tuck pastry in on all sides.  Brush top lightly with
butter and score top layer of pastry lightly into squares using a
sharp knife or razor blade. Sprinkle a little cold water on top to
prevent pastry curling up.

Bake in a moderate oven for 45 minutes until puffed and golden brown.
Remove from oven and leave for 5 minutes before cutting into portions
for serving.
