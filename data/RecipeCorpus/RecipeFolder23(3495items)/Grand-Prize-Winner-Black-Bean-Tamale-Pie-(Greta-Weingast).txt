Categories: Tex/mexican, Beans
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1    Egg, beaten
1/3 c  Milk
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 c  Canned corn, drained
4 oz Grated cheddar cheese
1/2 c  Onions, diced
1/3 c  Green peppers, diced
8 oz Ground turkey
8 oz Canned black beans, drained
8 oz Tomato sauce
1 pk Taco seasoning mix
1 c  Cornmeal
Preheat oven to 350ø.  Spray a 9" pie plate with nonstick cooking
spray and set aside.

Spray a medium sized skillet with nonstick cooking spray.  Saut
onions and green pepper until tender, about 3-5 minutes.  Add turkey
and cook until no longer pink, breaking the meat up into small chunks
as you cook. Stir in beans, tomato sauce, and taco seasoning mix.
Set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine cornmeal, sugar, and salt.  In a separate
small bowl mix the egg, milk, and oil.  Add egg mixture to cornmeal
mixture and combine well.  Stir in drained corn.  Press the cornmeal
mixture into the prepared pie plate like a crumb crust.  Spoon the
bean mixture on top of the cornmeal "crust".  Bake 20 minutes.
Sprinkle the top of the pie with grated cheese and bake an additional
5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.  Let stand 5 minutes before
serving.

This recipe, by Greta Weingast of Benecia California, won the $10,000
Grand Prize in the July 8, 1991 Lake to Lake/Chedarella Recipe
Contest. The original recipe of course calls for Chedarella rather
than any old grated cheddar cheese!
