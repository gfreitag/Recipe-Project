Collins recipe by Wolfgang Puck typed for you by Perry Lowell,
GOURMET, July '93 The length of time it takes for the ketchup to
thicken depends on the water content of the tomatos, so be patient.
Make only with vine-ripened tomatos.

Makes 2 cups.

In a medium stainless-steep or enamel saucepan, over a low flame,
cook the tomatos and garlic until the sauce begins to bubble.  Add
the onion and red pepper and cook 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir in the corn
syrup, vinegar, salt, and pickling spices and continue to simmer over
the low flame until the sauce reduces and thickens, about 1-1/2
hours, stirring occasionally.  (The sauce will reduce by about
one-half.)  Do not rush.  Cook over a low flame to prevent scorching.

Strain through a food mill and stir in the tomato paste.  Correct
seasoning to taste, cool, and refrigerate in a covered container
until needed. The ketchup will thicken slightly as it cools, but it
is not the consistency of store-bought ketchup.  The ketchup will
keep up to three weeks.
