PLACE THE GLUTINOUS RICE POWDER in a mixing bowl. Bring the water to
a boil and add the sugar; stir until completely dissolved. Pour sugar
water into the rice powder; stir until well mixed. Gather the dough
into a ball and knead until smooth. Cut dough in half and roll each
half into two 10-inch long rolls. Cut each roll into 10 pieces. Take
one piece and roll into a ball. Flatten it and place a 1/2-inch round
piece of sweet red paste into the center of dough. Fold over sides to
enclose filling and roll into a ball. Repeat until all the balls are
made. Wet your hands with water and roll one ball in your hands to
moisten the ball. Dip the ball into a dish of sesame seeds until the
entire surface is covered. Press lightly to help the seeds adhere.
Add enough oil to a wok to a depth of 2 1/2-inches. Heat to 350F.
Deep fry balls for 8 to 10 minutes. As they expand in the oil, take a
pair of chopsticks and squeeze the balls to help them expand and fill
with air. The balls should triple in size, float to the top of the
oil and turn golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels. Makes
about 20 balls.
