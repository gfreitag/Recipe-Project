Title: Grilled Peking Duck
Categories: Chinese, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
3    Garlic cloves; crushed
1 ts Ginger, ground
1    Duck (5 lb)
4 c  Water
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Honey
2 tb Turmeric
In a wide shallow pan or large deep skillet, combine all ingredients
except the duck.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer
five minutes.  Meanwhile, rinse the duck; remove giblets and neck,
reserving for soup. Truss the duck, making a handle of the string.
Place the pan with the hot soy mixture in the sink. Holding the duck
by the handle over the pan, ladle hot soy mixture on all sides until
the skin has a "cooked" look. Hang duck in a cool, airy, breezy place
for 4 to 6 hours to dry the skin. Or, place duck on a wire rack over
a pan and refrigerate overnight.  Pour leftover mixture in an
oven-proof saucepan.  Place duck, breast side down, in a roast holder
inside a deep aluminum foil drip pan. Place pan in the center of
grill; cover and grill for 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hours using over deep drip
pan containing 1/2" water.  Place soy mixture over direct coals and
boil to reduce by half.  Strain soy mixture through a fine sieve and
serve with duckling.
