Title: Knoepfle- Oder Spaetzleteig (Basic Spaetzle Dough)
Categories: Pasta, German
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Water
Salt
500 g  Flour (4 1/2 cups less 1
-Tbsp)
5    Eggs
Combine all ingredients and stir until the batter is smooth. One part
at a time, force through a spaetzle shaver and let drop straight into
boiling water.  As soon as the spaetzle rise to the surface, remove
them with a slotted spoon and rinse in warm water.

In olden days, the spaetzle dough was forced through a three- legged
sieve, by means of stirring.  This resulted in the so- called
'Knoepfle' (little buttons).  Another method - more common in the
Wuertemberg area - is to put the dough on a wooden board and scraping
off small slivers of dough, which then results in elongated spaetzle,
similar to the ones produced by a spaetzle press.

Serves 4.
