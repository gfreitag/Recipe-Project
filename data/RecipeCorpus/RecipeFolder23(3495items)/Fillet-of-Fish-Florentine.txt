Title: Fillet of Fish Florentine
Categories: Fish, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
-chopped spinach, cooked
2 pk (10 1/2 oz each) frozen
according to package directions 2 lb fish fillets 1 1/2 cups court
tbs  butter 2 tbs flour 1/3 cup cream 1/2 cup grated
bouillon 3
Swiss cheese Salt and Pepper to taste 2 tbs grated Parmesan cheese

Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Make the spinach according to package
directions, and drain in a colander, pressing with the back of a
spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Place the fish fillets
in a baking dish, and bring the court bouillon to a simmer on the
stove. Pour the liquid into the baking dish,  cover with a sheet of
buttered wax paper, buttered side down, and bake for 5 to 7 minutes.
Drain the cooking liquid, and reserve. Melt the butter in a saucepan
over low heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 3
minutes. Whisk in the reserved cooking liquid, and bring to a boil.
Add the cream and cheese to the sauce, and stir until smooth and
bubbly. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Preheat an oven
broiler. Stir half the sauce into the spinach, and arrange the
spinach on an ovenproof serving platter. Arrange the fish on top of
the spinach, and then top each fillet with some of the sauce.
Sprinkle the Parmesan on top of the sauce, and place under the
broiler for 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly browned. Serves 6. If
assembled a day in advance, refrigerate covered. Then rather then
broiling, heat dish in a 350 degrees oven until hot, about 15 minutes.
