900 g  Flour
8    Egg-whites
4    Eggs
12 tb Sugar
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
Peeling from 1 lemon *
1/2 kg Nuts, minced
1/2 kg Honey
* Is "Zetst" the correct word?

Mix all dough ingredients together and let them stay for half an
hour. Mix filling ingredients on a pan over fire till it gets thick.
Remove heat and add the lemon peeling. Thin the dough on a floured
surface to a thin layer. Cut with a glass round portions from the
dough, put some filling on each round and fold the dough to the
traditional triangular form. Bake in a preheated oven at 180 grades
Celsius for about half an hour. Optionally smear some egg-yolk on the
cookies a few minutes before baking is finished to add some glaze.
