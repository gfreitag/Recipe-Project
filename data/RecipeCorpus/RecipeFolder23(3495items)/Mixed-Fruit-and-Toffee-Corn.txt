Categories: Snack
Yield: 22 servings
1 tb Light corn syrup
1/2 c  Broken pecans
1/2 ts Vanilla
6 oz Pkg. mixed dried fruit bits
-(1 1/2 cups)
8 c  Popped popcorn (about 1/3 to
-1/2 cup unpopped)
1 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Sugar
3 tb Water
Remove all unpopped kernels from popped corn.  Place popcorn in a
buttered 17x12x2-inch baking pan.  Keep popcorn warm in a 300 degree
oven while making syrup mixture.

Butter the sides of a heavy 2-quart saucepan.  In the saucepan
combine the butter or margarine, sugar, water, and corn syrup.  Bring
mixture to boiling over medium heat.  Cook for 8 to 10 minutes,
stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to dissolve the sugar.  Avoid
splashing mixture on sides of pan.  Carefully clip candy thermometer
to side of pan.

Cook and stir mixture over medium heat till thermometer registers 255
degrees, hard-ball stage (10 to 15 minutes).  The mixture should boil
at a moderate, steady rate over the entire surface.

Remove saucepan from heat; remove candy thermometer.  Quickly add
pecans and vanilla; stir till combined.  Pour mixture over the
popcorn, toss gently to coat.  Bake, uncovered, in a 300 degree oven
for 15 minutes. Remove popcorn from oven; stir in fruit bits.  Bake,
uncovered, for 5 minutes more.  Turn popcorn mixture onto a large
piece of foil.  Cool mixture completely.  Serve immediately or store,
tightly covered, in a cool, dry place.  Makes about 22 (1/2 cup)
servings.
