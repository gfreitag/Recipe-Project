juice, and parsley. Lightly but thoroughly mix in the mushrooms and

This is an easy-to-prepare dish for the quicksilver Gemini that
combines the foods of Mercury (parsley and mushrooms) with a creamy
coating. Because of their association with death, mushrooms are an
appropriate food for the god whose duty was to conduct the souls of
the dead to the under- world. Rich in minerals and vitamins, parsley
helps relieve nervous conditions (often a Gemini complaint) and
soothes the stomach. Serve this delicious starter with a very chilled
white wine and thin slices of whole wheat bread and butter.
