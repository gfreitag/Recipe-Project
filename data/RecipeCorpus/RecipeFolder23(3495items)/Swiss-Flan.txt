Title: Swiss Flan
Categories: Appetizer, European
Yield: 10 servings
2 tb Butter
2    Eggs, beaten
2 c  Natural Gruyere cheese (1/2
-lb), shredded
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Biscuit mix
3 tb Butter
1/4 c  Light cream
FILLING:
1    Onion, large, sliced or
-chopped
PASTRY:

A Swiss cheese pie is called "flan." The pastry for this pie is
sometimes closer to a rich biscuit dough, but in other versions a
short pastry may be used. The word "flan" means different things in
different countries; In Spain it is plain cramel custard, in France a
fruit tart in pastry, in Switzerland a cheese custard in pastry. And
sometimes Swiss Flan is made with onions and cheese in custard!

TO MAKE THE PASTRY, chop butter into the biscuit mix, work in cream,
and roll out on lightly floured board; or press into a 9 inch pie
plate, fluting the edges. Chill while preparing filling.

FOR THE FILLING, cook onion in butter until golden; cool slightly. Add
eggs, cheese, and salt. Pour this mixture into pastry, and bake in
oven preheated to 425 degrees F. (very hot) for 15 minutes; then
reduce heat to 350 degrees F. (moderate) and continue baking 25 to 30
minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Serve warm as a luncheon entree to 4 to 6 persons, or cut into small
wedges for appetizers. Makes 10 to 12 appetizers.

VARIATIONS: Instead of this pastry, regular pie crust may be used. Or
make pastry of 1 cup flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon
salt, 1/3 cup butter, and 1 beaten egg. Do not attempt to roll out
this butter-rich pastry; press it with your fingers into pie pan,
fluting the edges.
