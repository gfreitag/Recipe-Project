LIGHT SPINACH DIP From Cook It Light Classics by Jeanne Jones.

chopped, or two 10-oz packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed 6 Tbsp
dehydrated minced or chopped onion 3 Tbsp unbleached all-purpose
flour 1 Tbsp instant nonfat dry milk 1/2 tsp onion powder 1/2 tsp
sugar 1/4 tsp turmeric 1/2 tsp salt 3 scallions, chopped (2/3 cup) 1
(8 oz) can sliced water chestnuts, drained and chopped 1 1/2 cups
light sour cream 1 cup reduced-calorie mayonnaise

If using fresh spinach, steam it over rapidly boiling water 1 to 2
minutes, until tender, then drain well.  If using frozen, simply
squeeze out the excess moisture but do not cook. In a small bowl,
combine the dehydrated onion, flour, dry milk, onion powder, sugar,
turmeric, and salt. In a medium-size bowl, combine the remaining
ingredients with the drained spinach. Add the dry ingredients to the
spinach mixture and mix well. Chill for several hours. Serve in a
hollowed-out bread round, if desired.
