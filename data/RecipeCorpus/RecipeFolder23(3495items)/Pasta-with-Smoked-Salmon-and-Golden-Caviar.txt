Cook pasta until al dente; rinse and drain. Blend up to 4 tablespoons
butter to moisten. Melt 3/4 cup butter in a large skillet. Add cream
and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium and
cook sauce until reduced, about 5 minutes. Add smoked salmon and
white pepper. (The smoked salmon will probably eliminate the need for
salt.) Add pasta to sauce and toss gently but thoroughly. Heat to
warm if necessary. Serve immediately with a spoonful of caviar on top
or on the side of each serving. Serves 6.
