Title: Oven Baked Flounder with Parmesan
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Milk
2 T  Grated Parmesan cheese
1 T  Margarine, melted
1 lb Flounder fillets
1/2 c  Dry bread crumbs
1/2 t  Thyme
Dip fillets in milk. Combine bread crumbs, cheese and thyme. Coat
perch with mixture. Place in a single layer in a greased baking pan.
Drizzle with melted margarine. Bake at 450 degrees for ten minutes or
until fish flakes easily. Tip: For a little different taste, replace
the milk with French Salad Dressing. Works just as well.. Tip No. 2:
Don't be afraid to use fish that nobody calls perch in this recipe.
