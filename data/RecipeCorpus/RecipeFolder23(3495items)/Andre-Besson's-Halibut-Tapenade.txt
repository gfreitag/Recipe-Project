Title: Andre Besson's Halibut Tapenade
Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 servings
1    Onion, medium, minced
1/2    Bay Leaf
1    Garlic Clove, crushed
-Pepper, freshly ground
1    Lemon, juice
2 T  Basil, fresh, chopped
1/4 c  Olive Oil, extra virgin
2    Tomatoes, ripe, medium
1 pn Thyme
-Salt
1 T  Black Olives pitted chopped
1 t  Dijon Mustard (optional)
2    Halibut Filets
Any other firm white fish may be substituted. Heat 2 tbs of the olive
oil in a small, heavy pan and saute minced onion until almost
translucent. Meanwhile, immerse tomatoes quickly in boiling water to
help remove skin. Remove, skin them, halve them, gently squeeze out
the seed, coarsely dice them, and add them to the sauteing onions.
Add half a bay leaf, a pinch of thyme, garlic, salt and pepper to
taste and reduce mixture at a medium boil for about 20 minutes or
until liquid is syrupy and almost evaporated and tomatoes are cooked.
A minute or 2 before removing from heat, stir in chopped black
olives. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine the juice of one lemon
with twice as much olive oil, salt and pepper to taste and dijon
mustard, mixing in a blender if desired. Then fold in chopped fresh
basil. Set aside. Cook fish portions lightly until just tender by
steaming, poaching, or by sauteing quickly in olive oil. Arrange
cooked fish on dinner plates. Stir the basil and a half of its
lemon-olive oil vinaigrette into the hot tomato and black olive
mixture. Quickly spoon the resulting mixture around each fish filet,
and serve. Serves 2.
