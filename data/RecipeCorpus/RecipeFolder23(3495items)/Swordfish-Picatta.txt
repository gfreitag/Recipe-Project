Title: Swordfish Picatta
Categories: Fish, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
3 T  Flour, for coating fish
1 1/2 lb Swordfish steaks
3 T  Butter
2    To 3  tbs capers
2    Lemons
3    Eggs
1/4 c  Milk
-Salt and pepper
3 T  Oil
PREPARATION:  Cut the ends off one of the lemons and pare away the
rind and all the white pith down to the flesh.  Cut lemon into
paper-thin rounds, removing any seeds. Whisk the eggs.  Whisk in the
Parmesan cheese, 3 tbs flour, and enough milk to make a batter the
consistency of heavy cream. Cut the fish across the grain into
1/4-inch thick medallions. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Recipe can
be completed to this point several hours ahead.

COOKING AND SERVING:  Heat the butter and oil in a large frying pan
over medium heat.  Dust the fish pieces with flour and dip them in
the batter. Panfry them in the butter and oil, turning them once,
until the coating is golden brown and the fish just tests done, about
3 minutes total. Transfer the fish to warm plates.  Make a lemon
butter sauce by squeezing the juice from the second lemon into the
frying pan and stirring with a wooden spoon to deglaze the pan.  Add
salt and pepper to taste. Top each piece of fish with a few capers
and lemon slices. Pour lemon butter sauce over all and serve hot.
