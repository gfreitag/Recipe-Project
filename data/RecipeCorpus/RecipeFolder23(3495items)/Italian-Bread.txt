Categories: Bread, Italian
Yield: 2 servings
Water
Cornmeal
1    Egg
Salad oil
1 tb Sugar
2 ts Salt
2 pk Active dry yeast
5 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Butter or margarine
1.  In large bowl, combine sugar, salt, yeast, and 2 cups flour.  In
1-quart saucepan over low heat, heat butter or margarine and 1 3/4
cups water until very warm (120ø to 130ø F.)  (Butter or margarine
does not need to melt.)

2.  With mixer at low speed, gradually beat liquid into dry
ingredients until just blended.  Increase speed to medium; beat 2
minutes, occasionally scraping bowl with rubber spatula.

3.  Beat in 1/2 cup flour to make thick batter; continue beating
mixture at medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl often with
rubber spatula. With wooden spoon, stir in enough additional flour
(about 1 3/4 cups) to make a soft dough.

4.  Turn dough onto floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic,
about 10 minutes, adding flour while kneading.

5.  Cut dough in half; cover pieces with bowl; let dough rest for 20
minutes for easier shaping.

6.  Grease large cookie sheet; sprinkle cookie sheet with cornmeal.

7.  On floured surface with floured rolling pin, roll each half into
15" by 10" rectangle.  From 15" side, tightly roll dough, jelly-roll
fashion; pinch seam to seal.

8.  Place loaves, seam side down, on cookie sheet and taper ends.
Brush loaves with oil; cover loosely with plastic wrap; Refrigerate 2
to 24 hours.

9.  Preheat oven to 425ø F.  Meanwhile, remove loaves from
refrigerator; uncover; let stand 10 minutes.  Cut 3 or 4 diagonal
slashes on top of each loaf.  Bake 20 minutes.

10. In small bowl with fork, beat egg white with 1 tablespoon of
water. Remove loaves from oven; brush with egg-white mixture; return
to oven and bake 5 minutes.
