Title: Jeff's Favorite Pizza Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Italian, Pizza
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Oregano, heaping
3/4 ts Garlic powder
1/8 c  Parmesan cheese
1 ts Light brown sugar
2 ts Olive oil
28 oz Canned Progresso Plum
Tomatoes w/Basil, drained
12 oz Tomato paste
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Onion powder
This sauce has a quality similar to restaurant flavor, but being
freshly made seems to take on a better flavor.

Puree the drained tomatoes well.  It is important to use Italian
Plum Tomatoes, not regular canned tomatoes.  The flavor is
distinctively different.  If you cannot find Progresso Plum Tomatoes
with basil, add 1/2 ts. basil to the tomatoes.

Place the puree mixture in heavy saucepan.  Add remaining
ingredients except for the grated cheese and brown sugar.  Simmer 1/2
hour, or longer if necessary.  Add cheese and brown sugar last 10
minutes of cooking. The canned grated parmesan is good in this
recipe, as well as fresh.

Sauce can be frozen if needed.

Enjoy! - Jeff Duke
