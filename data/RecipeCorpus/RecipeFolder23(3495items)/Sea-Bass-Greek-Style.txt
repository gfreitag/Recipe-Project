8    8-oz sea bass fillets
1/2 c  Flour (or as needed)
2 tb Light olive oil
1    Lemon; juiced
3 tb Vegetable oil
2 lg Yellow onions; chopped fine
6    Garlic cloves; crushed
Dust the sea bass fillets with the flour.

In a large skillet place the 2 tablespoons of olive oil and heat it on
medium high until it is hot.  Quickly sear the fillets on both sides
so that they are sealed.  Place the fish in a large baking pan and
sprinkle on the lemon juice.  Set the fish aside.

In a medium skillet place the 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil and heat
on medium high until it is hot.  Add the onions, garlic, and parsley.
Saute the ingredients for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the onions are
translucent. Add the pepper and stir it in.

In a medium large saucepan place the sauteed onion mixture, canned
tomatoes, chopped tomato, bay leaves, rosemary, and white wine.  Stir
the ingredients together and simmer them on low heat for 40 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Pour the sauce over the fish and bake it
for 20 minutes, or until it is just done.

Garnish the dish with the lemon wedges.
