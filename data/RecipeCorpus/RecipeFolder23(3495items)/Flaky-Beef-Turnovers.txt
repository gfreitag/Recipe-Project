"It's important to cut potatoes into very small pieces, so they get
done by the time the pastry is brown."

Preheat oven to 400 F (205 C).  Trimbeef; discard fat.  Cut beef into
cubes no larger than 1/2 inch.  In a medium bowl, combine beef,
potatoes, soup mix, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and parsley.  On a
lightly floured board, roll out each pastry shell to a 7-inch circle.
Spoon equal amounts or about 1/4 cup meat mixture on each rolled-out
shell.  Brush edges with water.  Fold over; press with tines of a
fork to seal.  Cut several slits in top of each.  Place on a baking
sheet.  Bake in preheated oven 20 to 25 minutes or until golden
brown.  Serve hot.  Makes 6 turnovers.
