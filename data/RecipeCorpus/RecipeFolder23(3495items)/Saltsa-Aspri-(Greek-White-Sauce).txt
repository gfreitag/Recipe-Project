Grated nutmeg
Salt & White pepper
To make the sauce, in a heavy saucepan melt the butter and heat
WITHOUT browning.  Using a wire whisk, stir in the flour.  Cook for 1
to 2 minutes over low heat, then remove from the burner and gradually
stir in the warm milk.  Move the pan back to the heat and bring to a
boil, stirring steadily for a smooth sauce.  Add a pinch of salt and
white pepper, and grate a little nutmeg for a nice flavor.
As a general rule, thin white sauce is used for soups and sauces,
medium for pastitsio and moussaka and other au gratin dishes, and a
thick sauce for croquettes and souffles. From "The Food of Greece" by
Vilma Liacouras Chantiles.
