1 1/2 ts Tomato paste

DIRECTIONS:

In a small bowl, combine the tomato paste with the water. Stir to

In a heavy, medium, nonreactive saucepan, heat the olive oil over
moderate heat. Add the onion and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes.
Add the peas, salt and the diluted tomato paste and bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat to very low, cover and cook until the peas are very

vigorously until almost all the liquid has evaporated, 3 to 5
minutes. Serve at once.
