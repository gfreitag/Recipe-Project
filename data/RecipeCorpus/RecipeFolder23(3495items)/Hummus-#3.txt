Title: Hummus #3
Categories: Dip
Yield: 1 servings
Onion
Water from cooked beans
2 ts Cumin, powdered (optional)
Paprika for garnish
Parsley for garnish
2 c  Dry chick peas
1 lb Jar tahini
3    Garlic cloves
1/4 c  Soy sauce, natural (tamari)
1    Lemon
Soak beans overnight.  Drain and place on cookie sheet.  Freeze
several hours.  cook frozen beans in double amount of water with
onion in it or cook in a pressure cooker instead of freezing first.
Blend cooked beans (pureeing while still warm makes blending easier)
and onion a little at a time, using as much water as necessary to
keep blender going.  Add garlic cloves, soy sauce and lemon juice to
taste along with beans.  If you're using cumin, add it now. When all
beans have been blended with other ingredients to a thick sauce,
place in a large bowl. Add one jar of tahini and mix well, adding
more tamari, garlic, or lemon juice if a stronger flavor is desired.
(add more water for thinner consistency.) Place on a shallow dish,
spread smoothly and sprinkle with paprika and parsley. Serve with
pita strips, use as a sandwich spread, or stuff into celery.

VARIATIONS: a) Avocado Hoomus: mash in 1 large ripe avocado  b)
Eggplant Hoomus:  mash in one medium baked eggplant (no skin) and mix
with cumin added to garbanzo tahini blend.
