Title: Chorizo
Categories: Pork, Tex/mexican
Yield: 6 servings
8 lg Buds fresh garlic
1 tb Oregano
2 ts Black coarse pepper
1 c  Water
10 lb Boneless Pork Butt
6 tb Salt
1 c  Vinegar
5 tb Paprika
3 tb Hot ground pepper
Grind all the pork butts thru a 1/4" grinding plate and place into a
mixer. Add all the ingredients and mix well until all the spices are
evenly distributed.  Chorizo is to be stuffed into a 40-42 MM hog
casing. Place on smoke sticks and let dry in cooler overnight.  This
particular sausage takes much longer to dry than most others.
