Title: Tortellini with Cream
Categories: Pasta, Italian
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
Freshly ground black pepper
4 tb Butter
1 c  Heavy cream
48    Tortellini
MELT THE BUTTER in a medium-size saucepan; add the heavy cream and
heat through. Cook the tortellini in boiling salted water, then drain
them and place them in a heated serving bowl. Pour the cream-butter
mixture over them and toss thoroughly so that some of the cream is
absorbed. Add 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese and a generous quantity
of pepper, and toss again. Pass additional cheese at table.
