Title: Boiled Peanuts
Categories: Snack
Yield: 8 servings
Water
Peanuts,raw
1. Wash raw peanuts thoroughly in cool water; then soak in clean cool
water for about 30 minutes before cooking.
2. Put peanuts in a saucepan and cover completely with water. Because
the shells of some peanuts absorb more salt than others, it's best to
begin with 1 tablespoon of salt for each 2 cups of peanuts; you can
add more salt to taste later.
3. The cooking period for boiled peanuts varies according to the
maturity of the peanuts used and the variety of peanut. The cooking
time for a "freshly pulled" green peanut is shorter than for a peanut
which has been stored for a time.
4. When fully cooked, the texture of the peanut should be similar to
that of a cooked dry pea or bean. Boil the peanuts for about 35
minutes, then taste. If they are not salted enough, add more salt.
Taste again in 10 minutes, both for salt content and to see if the
peanuts are fully cooked. If not ready, continue tasting every 5
minutes until they have a satisfactory texture.
5. Drain peanuts after cooking or they will continue to absorb salt
and become oversalted.
6. Boiled peanuts are usually served as a snack, but they make a great
substitute for dried cooked beans at any meal. They may be eaten hot,
at room temperature, or chilled in the refrigerator and eaten cold,
shelling as you eat them. They will keep in the refrigerator for
several days, or they may be frozen.
