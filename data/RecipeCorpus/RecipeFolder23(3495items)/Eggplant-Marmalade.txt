Title: Eggplant Marmalade
Categories: Condiment
Yield: 8 servings
1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
Juice of 2 large lemons
Grated rind of 1/2 lemon
2 lb Of eggplant
4 c  Of sugar (2 pounds)
4 c  Of water
1 ts Ground nutmeg
Makes about 8 half-pints

Wash, peel and dice the eggplant.  Barely cover with water in a
preserving kettle and boil for about 10 minutes; drain and set aside.
Make a syrup by combining the sugar, water, nutmeg and cinnamon and
bringing them to a boil.  Add the eggplant.  Remove from heat, cover
and allow to stand overnight.  The next day, remove the eggplant with
a slotted spoon and boil the syrup for 20 minutes to thicken it.
Return the eggplant to the kettle and boil for 30 to 40 minutes until
the syrup sheets when dropped from a spoon (2 drops forming on the
edge of the spoon, coming together and falling as 1 drop), or until a
jelly thermometer reads 220 to 222 F.  Stir in the lemon juice and
grated rind. Ladle into hot, sterilized jars and seal.

To seal:  Fill to within 1/2-inch head room, being sure to first wipe
the rim and threads of the jars with a hot damp cloth to remove all
particles of food, seeds or spices.  While contents are hot, cover
with a 1/8-inch layer of paraffin.  When paraffin has set, add
another layer of melted paraffin, tilting and rotating the jar to
seal completely.
