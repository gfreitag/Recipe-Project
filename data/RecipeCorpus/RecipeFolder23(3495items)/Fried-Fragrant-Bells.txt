Yield: 40 servings
2 tb Cornstarch
3 tb Water
4    Dried bean curd sheet
Additional cornstarch
1/4 c  Salt
2 tb Szechwan peppercorns
2    To 4 cups vegetable oil
1 lb Ground pork

1 tb Dry Sherry
1    Egg
Combine pork, onion, ginger, broth, soy sauce, Sherry, egg and 1
tablespoon cornstarch in bowl and mix well. Combine remaining 1
tablespoon cornstarch with water in small bowl.

Moisten 1 bean curd sheet under running water. Place on work surface
and spread with 1/4 of meat mixture. Roll as for jelly roll; brush
long edge with dissolved cornstarch to seal. Repeat to make three
more rolls. Cut each into slices 1 1/2 inches thick; dip each end in
additional cornstarch to seal filling. (Can be done 3 to 4 hours
ahead to this point and refrigerated.)

For salt: Combine salt and peppercorns in small skillet and cook until
browned. Crush in mortar with pestle.

Heat oil in wok or deep fryer to 375 deg. Add slices a few at a time
and fry until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot with peppercorn
salt, if desired.
