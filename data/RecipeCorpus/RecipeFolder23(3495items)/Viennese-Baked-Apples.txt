An old Egyptian dream book states that "to dream of looking at apples
betokens a wedding.  To dream of eating apples is a sign of mourning
unless they are very sweet, then it is a sign of a great deal of
prosperity in the marriage state".  Apples have travelled from the
Old World to the New, but for some reason, we haven't created as many
interesting desserts with them as the Europeans.  We seem to limit
ourselves to pies, crunchy puddings, applesauce and jelly.  This is
one new way to try apples.

When possible, use the large Rome Beauty apples

Core apples and peel skin about 1/3 of the way down from the stem end.
Pierce the rest of the skin all over with a fork to lessen wrinkling
and splitting. Place apples in a large, deep pan that has a good
cover and add water to a depth of 1/4 inch.  Mix jam with orange rind
and nuts,fill the centre of each apple, then sprinkle sugar over top.
Bring water in pan to a boil, then cover, lower heat and simmer 20-30
minutes,depending on size of apples.  Baste 2-3 times with pan
juices.  To glaze apples, uncover when cooled, sprinkle top with an
additional tbsp of sugar and place under broiler 3 inches from heat
until lightly browned. Watch closely, as they brown very quickly.
Serve warm, tepid or cold. Serves 6.
