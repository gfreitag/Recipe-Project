Select firm, well-ripened strawberries.  Wash and drain carefully.
Remove hulls.  Combine berries with an equal weight of sugar. Heat
slowly to boiling.  Boil 8 minutes.  Remove from fire and allow to
stand for 24 hours.  Pour without heating into sterilized jars. Seal
at once. These berries will be plump and will not rise to the top of
the jar. The Household Searchlight
