platter and keep warm. (chicken may be placed in 200 degree oven

Add wine and lemon juice to skillet and simmer over moderately high
heat, stirring to blend in browned particles. Boil, reducing to about

slightly. Pour any meat juices from warming platter into sauce.

Adjust sauce for seasoning to taste. Pour over meat and garnish with
parsley, lemon slices and capers. Serves 6.
