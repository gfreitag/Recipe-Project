Stephen Ceideburg
2 lg Banana chilies or New
-Mexican or yellow wax hot
-chilies
3 lg Shallots, peeled and halved
5    Cloves garlic, peeled
Serve as a dip with raw vegetables or as a condiment. If the chilies
are very hot, you may want to seed them. Dry-frying, a method of
roasting, is simply frying without fat.

Heat a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Add whole chilies and
dry-fry for about 4 minutes, pressing down with a wooden spoon and
turning occasionally. Add shallots and garlic to the skillet and
continue to dry-fry, turning occasionally. for about 5 minutes, or
until the chili skins are blackened. Transfer the mixture to a bowl
and cool. Add tomatoes to the skillet and dry-fry for about 5
minutes, turning occasionally, or until the skins are blackened. Let
cool.

Remove stems from the chilies and cut in half lengthwise. (Do not
remove skins.) Remove seeds if you prefer less heat. Core the
tomatoes and cut into quarters. (Do not remove skins.) Place chilies,
tomatoes, shallots and garlic in a food processor and, pulsing,
process until the mixture is coarsely chopped and salsa-like in
texture (not pureed). Alternatively, chop vegetables finely with a
knife. Transfer the mixture to a small bowl and stir in cilantro,
fish sauce and lime juice. (The dip can be prepared up to 3 days
ahead and stored, covered, in the refrigerator.)

Makes 1 1/4 cups.
