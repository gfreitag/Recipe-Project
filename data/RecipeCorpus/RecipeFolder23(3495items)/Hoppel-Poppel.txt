1.  Remove the pork and eggs from the refrigerator approximately 45
minutes before proceeding to the next steps.

2.  Melt the butter in a medium sized or large skillet over low to
moderate heat. Add the onions and saute them for about 1 minute,
stirring constantly.

3.  Add the potatoes and saute for about 3 minutes.  Stir frequently.

4.  Add the pork and saute for about 3 minutes.  Stir frequently.

5.  Break the eggs in a bowl and add to them the cream, chopped dill,
salt, and pepper. Beat this mixture as you would for a standard
omelet.

6.  Pour the egg mixture over the potatoes, meat, and onions in the
skillet. Cover the skillet, reduce the heat to low, and cook the
preparation for about 5 minutes, or until the eggs have set.

7.  Slide the 'Hoppel Poppel' onto a warm plate of the same size.
Securely hold the plates together and quickly but carefully invert
them so that the more attractive browned side of the 'Hoppel Poppel'
is face up.

8.  Garnish the 'Hoppel Poppel' with the dill sprigs.  Cut it at the
table into pizza style wedges. Serve immediately.

Serves 2.
