Title: Anzac Biscuits
Categories: Down under, Bread
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 lb Butter
1 tb Golden syrup
1 ts Bicarbonate of soda
2 tb Boiling water
1 c  Rolled oats
1 c  Plain flour
1 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Coconut
(Interesting that butter is always given as a weight in grams in my
copy but everything else is given in cups, tablepsoons or teaspoons).

Perhaps they publish nonmetric measures for cookbooks distributed in
North America. It makes it very confusing (see the conversion table I
quote to Vince from the back of this book). It would be MUCH easier
if metric were used (I even have a measuring cups that will measure
decilitres as used in Europe, they aren't used here in Canada.)

Maybe somebody who lives in Sydney could get ahold of the magazine and
clear up this confusion.
