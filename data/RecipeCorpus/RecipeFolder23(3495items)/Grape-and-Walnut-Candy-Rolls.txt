40    Whole walnuts
12 oz Frozen grape juice;undiluted
Thread a needle with 2 foot length of white, heavy-duty carpet
thread. Tie a knot 8 inches from the end. Carefully string 20
walnuts. Tie a knot after the last walnut. Tie thread ends together
forming a necklace. Repeat for remaining 20 walnuts. Divide the grape
juice concentrate. From one half, pour 1/3 cup into a jar. Pour the
remaining amount of that half into a small saucepan. Heat to boiling.
Spinkle 5 teaspoons of cornstarch into the jar of juice. Shake
vigorously. Gradually stir into boiling juice. Cook until thick
enough to heavily coat spoon. Remove from heat. Dip one "necklace"
into grape juice until every nut is coated. Hang loop in an airy
spot. Dip and hang second necklace. Allow to hang 30 minutes. Repeat
the whole procedure. Dry necklaces several days until coating is no
longer sticky. When dry, repeat dipping. Use the remaining half of
grape juice and cornstarch.  Dip necklaces twice.  Let hang to dry a
week.  When dry, snip knotted thread.  Carefully pull out.  Dust
rolls with confectioners' sugar. Slice into 1/2 inch rounds.  Makes
two 7-inch rolls.
