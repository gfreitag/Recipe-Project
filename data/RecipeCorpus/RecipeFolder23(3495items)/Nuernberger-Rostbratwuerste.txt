Title: Nuernberger Rostbratwuerste
Categories: Pork, German
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Marjoram
Salt to taste
Natural sausage casing,
Ca. 1/2" diameter
500 g  Pork (not too fat)
150 g  Veal
1/4 ts Finely chopped caraway seed
(not ground)
1/4 ts Nutmeg
Coarsely chop the pork and veal on a cutting board (should be a bit
coarser than ground meat), combine with caraway seed, nutmeg,
marjoram and salt. Fill into the carefully cleaned sausage casing;
twist casing to form a sausage every 3 1/4". The bratwurst tastes
best when browned on all sides over charcoal. Excellent with
sauerkraut and a German country style rye bread. As a drink to go
with it, a hearty beer is recommended.
