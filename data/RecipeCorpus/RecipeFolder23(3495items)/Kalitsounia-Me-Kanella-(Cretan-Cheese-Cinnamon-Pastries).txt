Karen Mintzias
1 1/2 c  Fresh mizithra or ricotta
2 tb Grated hard ricotta
2    Eggs; separated
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
2 tb Butter; melted
For the filling, combine the cheeses, lightly beaten egg yolks,
sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and melted butter in a bowl. The
mixture should be thick enough to mound, but not stiff; add 1
tablespoon milk, if necessary.  Set aside while you make the dough.

Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, then cut in the butter and mix by
rubbing between your fingers.  Mix in the vanilla, egg whites, and
enough milk to make a soft dough.  Knead until smooth and elastic,
then break off small pieces and roll as thin of a dime.  (The dough
will be elastic and can be rolled easily.)  Cut into circles 4-inches
in diameter (teacup size), then on each circle place a teaspoon of
the cheese filling.  Wet the circle edge with water or milk and fold
over to form a half-moon, then seal with the tines of a fork or
pastry wheel.  Arrange the Kaltisounia on buttered cookie sheets and
bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes, or until the pastry
puffs up and turns a light chestnut color.  Remove from the oven, and
place on racks, and dust with confectioners' sugar and cinnamon.
Serve hot or cold.
