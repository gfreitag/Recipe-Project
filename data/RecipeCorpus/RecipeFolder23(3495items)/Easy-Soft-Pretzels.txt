* Poppy seed * Sesame seed * Course salt * Garlic or onion salt

Unroll pizza dough onto an 18-inch piece of lightly floured waxed
paper. Roll dough into a 16 by 10 inch rectangle.  Cut dough
lengthwise into 10 1 inch-wide strips.  Shape each strip of dough
into a circle, overlapping about 4 inches from each end and leaving
ends free.  Taking one end of the dough in each hand, twist at the
point where the dough overlaps. Carefully lift each end across to the
edge of the circle opposite it. Tuck ends under to seal.  Place
pretzels 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet.

Stir together egg and water.  Brush pretzels with egg mixture.
Sprinkle with sesame seed, poppy seed, coarse salt, garlic salt or
onion salt. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 15 to 17 minutes or until
golden.  Serve warm.
