~-- A subtle blend of hot and sour with citrus overtones, Tom Yam
Goong is the most famous of all Thai Soups.  Each region has its own
particular variation of the recipe.  This recipe is from Bangkok and
the Central Plains
~---------------------------------------------------------------------
~-- Rinse the shrimp shells and place them in a large pot with the
water. Heat to boiling, strain the broth and discard the shells.

Add the garlic, lime leaves, galangal, fish sauce, lemon grass and
shallots to the stock, then the mushrooms and chili peppers, if
using. Cook gently for 2 minutes.

Add the shrimp to the soup, and reheat to boiling.  When the shrimp
are cooked, place the lime juice and black chili paste in a serving
bowl.  Pour the soup into the bowl, stir, garnish with the cilantro
leaves and serve.
