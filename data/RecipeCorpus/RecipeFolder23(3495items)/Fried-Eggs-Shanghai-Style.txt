Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Sherry

This recipe will introduce you to an inexpensive gourmet treat.

Preparation:  Flake crab meat into strands, removing any cartilage.
Mix with sherry.  Wash onions; remove roots and greens; finely mince
white part. Wash and pat dry lettuce leaves; arrange on round serving
plate. In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites.  When eggs begin to stiff-
en, slowly add milk. When eggs are stiff, fold in crab, onions, salt
and cornstarch. Eggs will tend to break down at this point into a
frothy soup.

Stir-frying:  Heat wok to medium hot.  Add oil.  When oil is heated,
add egg mixture, carefully folding and turning while eggs become
firm. Remove to serving platter.  Serve.
