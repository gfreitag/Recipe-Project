Maryland Crab Cakes

Trim crusts from bread and lay slices on a shallow platter. Pour oil
over them and let stand until bread is thoroughly saturated.  Use
forks to break into small pieces. Combine egg yolks with mustard,
salt and Worcestershire sauce. Beat lightly.  Stir in bread and crab
meat, gently fold in stiffly beaten egg whites, and shape mixture
into patties. Sprinkle with paprika and saute in heated butter until
golden on both sides.
