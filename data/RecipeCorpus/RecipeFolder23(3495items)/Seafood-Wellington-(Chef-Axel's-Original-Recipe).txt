Title: Seafood Wellington (Chef Axel's Original Recipe)
Categories: Seafood, French
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Quartered mushrooms
4 oz Clarified butter
1 1/2 oz Cognac
8 oz Lobstertail meat
8    Giant prawns
12 lg Scallops
MMMMM------------------------NANTUA SAUCE-----------------------------
1/4 ts Cayenne
1 ds Tabasco
Paprika; to taste
1 sm Lemon wedge
Salt and pepper; to taste
4 oz Clarified butter
1 md Onion
1 pt Lobster stock
1/2 pt Heavy cream
1 tb Flour (heaping measure)
1 ts Tomato paste
Bake four vol au vents (puff pastry shells).  Either use homemade
mille feuille or commercial puff pastry dough and follow
instructions.  Vol au vent should be oval shaped and about 12 x 8 cm
(5" x 3") in size.

Sauce preparation:  Saute finely-chopped onion in 4 ounces clarified
butter, add tomato paste, flour, and paprika.  Mix well, add stock,
stirring until smooth.  Simmer on low heat for 15 minutes.  Add heavy
cream, seasoning to taste.  Add a dash of cayenne, tabasco and the
lemon wedge (easy on the spices; Nantua sauce should not be spicy
hot).  Let simmer for five more minutes.  Retrieve lemon.  Blend
sauce in high-spped blender until smooth and creamy.

Heat saute pan on medium to high heat.  Drop in butter, then add in
quick succession: first lobster meat, then prawns, sauteeing each
until rare, then add mushrooms.  Flame with cognac, add the scallops
and saute for 2-3 minutes.  Pour in the Nantua sauce, adding the bay
shrimp, and bring to a short bowl.  Fill in preheated vol au vents
and serve with steamed vegetables.
