Title: Shrimp Risotto
Categories: Italian, Seafood, Rice
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Italian Arborio rice
1 1/4 c  Dry white wine
2    Zucchini, cut into thin
-strips
6 oz Oyster mushrooms, cut into
-pieces
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese,
-divided
1 lb Shrimp (unshelled)
1    Bay leaf
Celery leaves (A few)
6    Peppercorns
Salt, to taste
Saffron threads (A few)
3 3/4 c  Water
6 tb Butter, divided
1    Onion, chopped
1    Clove garlic, crushed
Rinse and peel the shrimp; set aside.  Rinse the shrimp shells, then
put them in a saucepan along with the bay leaf, celery leaves,
peppercorns, salt, saffron, and water.  Bring to a boil, then simmer
for 20 minutes. Strain and reserve the stock.

In a heavy large saucepan or skillet, melt 3 tablespoons of the
butter; add the onion and garlic.  Cook for about 5 minutes or until
softened but not colored.  Add the rice and stir to coat all the
grains with butter.  Add 1/3 of the reserved stock and bring to a
boil, then simmer, uncovered, until the stock is absorbed.  Stirring,
gradually add more stock and the wine until it has all been absorbed
and the rice is cooked; this will take about 20 minutes.

In a separate pan, melt the remaining butter, add the shrimp,
zucchini, and mushrooms; cook for 3 or 4 minutes.  Fold the mixture
into the rice along with the rice and half of the cheese.  Taste and
add salt, if needed.

Serve piping hot, sprinkled with the remaining cheese.

Makes 4 servings.
