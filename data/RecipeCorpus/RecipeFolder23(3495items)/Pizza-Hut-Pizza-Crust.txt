Title: Pizza Hut Pizza Crust
Categories: Pizza
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Sugar
1 pk Dry yeast
1/3 ts Garlic salt
2 tb Olive oil
1 1/3 c  Warm water
1/2 ts Salt
4 c  Flour
1/3 ts Oregano
Mix 1 c flour and remaining ingredients in food processor; beat 1
min. Add flour gradually and process until dough leaves the side of
the container. Place in greased bowl, turn to grease top, and cover
with plastic wrap. Let rise in refrigerator overnight. Divide dough
in thirds. Press with heel of hand onto greased pizza pan until crust
fills pan. (Unless, of course, you are talented enough to toss it
into the air.) Bake in 350F oven for 5 minutes.  Freeze. When ready
to make pizza, remove from freezer and quickly cover with pizza sauce
and toppings. Bake on oven rack without pan.
