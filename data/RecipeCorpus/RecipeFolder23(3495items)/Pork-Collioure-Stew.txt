PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Pat the pork dry with paper towels and sprinkle
with desired salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over
medium-high heat on top of the stove. Add the pork, without crowding,
and brown well on all sides. You may have to perform this operation
in batches. Remove the pieces to a plate as they are brown. Pour off
all but about 2 tablespoons fat. Reduce heat to low and replace the
pot on the stove. Add the onion and cook 5 minutes, scraping up any
brown bits that cling to the pan. Add the flour and cook another
minute, stirring. Add the wine, vinegar and broth and bring to a
boil. Return the pork to the pot with any juices on the plate and add
bay leaves and thyme. Cover tightly and transfer the pot to the oven.
Cook for 1 1/4 hours, or until meat is barely tender. Remove the
casserole from the oven and, using a slotted spoon, remove the meat
from sauce and set aside. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve into
a container and discard onions and herbs. Replace the meat in the
pot, add horseradish, mustard, cream, lemon juice and parsnips. Cover
and replace in oven for 20-to-30 minutes or until meat is tender and
parsnips are cooked. Remove from oven and serve with boiled potatoes
or buttered noodles.
