Sterilize pint or half pint canning jars.  Into each jar, place a
clove of garlic (optional), and a sprig of Mexican oregano (also
optional, but highly recommended).

Pack the washed peppers into the jars.  For a hotter product, prick
each pepper a couple of times with a fork (I don't know why, but it
seems to work).

Fill the jars with boiling vinegar to cover the peppers well.  Cap.
My grandmother never processed these, just stuck them on the shelf
for a couple of months to marinate. On the rare occasions when I've
made 'em, I keep the jars under refrigeration, just to be sure.

Please note I am NOT a canning/preserving expert -- have done VERY
little of this (got my fill of it as a kid). I've only made these a
couple of times as an adult, and they turned out fine, but surely
there are more expert opinions out there....
