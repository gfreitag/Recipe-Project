This spinach and yogurt dish is Persian in origin, The yogurt is
redolent with both musky and sweet spices complementing the slightly
tart taste of the spinach. Borani Esfanah is enjoyed as an appetizer,
side dish, or dip to spread on bread.  Though untraditional, the hot
pepper flavoring adds zip. Accompany with French bread, or pita; or,
for a more tactile experience, tear off pieces of warm, soft flour
tortillas and scoop up the savory mixture.
