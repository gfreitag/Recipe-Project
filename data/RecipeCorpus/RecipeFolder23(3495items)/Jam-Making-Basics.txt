Title: Jam-Making Basics
Categories: Spread
Yield: 1 servings
See Below
Select fully ripened fruits and rinse them quickly under cold water
and then drain thoroughly.  Do not soak the fruit in water.  Do not
double the recipes.  Do not substitute ingredients.  Do not reduce
the amount of sugar or increase the amount of fruit used.  An exact
balance of fruit, sugar, and pectin is needed for jelling to occur.
For no cook jams, mash the fruit with a potato masher.  For cooked
jams, process the fruit in a food processor using quick on and off
pulses until finely chopped. For preserves, until coarsely chopped.
Do NOT puree.

NOTE:

A rolling boil is a boil that cannot be stirred down.
