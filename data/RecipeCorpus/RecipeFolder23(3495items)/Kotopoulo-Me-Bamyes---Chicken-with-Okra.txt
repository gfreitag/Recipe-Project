1/4 c  Butter
1    Onion; finely chopped
1    Garlic clove; crushed
1 1/2 c  Chopped, peeled tomatoes

Cut chicken into serving pieces and wipe dry.  Melt butter in a heavy
saucepan or flameproof casserole and brown chicken on all sides.
Remove to a plate when browned.

Reduce heat and add onion and garlic.  Fry gently until onion is
transparent and add remaining ingredients.  Cover and simmer for 20
minutes.

Meanwhile, lightly brown prepared okra in a little butter and set
aside.

Return chicken to pan, cover and simmer gently for 45 minutes or until
chicken is tender, adding browned okra 20 minutes before end of
cooking time.  Remove bay leaf and cinnamon bark and serve with
boiled or mashed potatoes.
