4 oz Tuna fish, or:
3 oz Eel or:
3 oz Ikan teri
1 c  Thick santen (coconut milk)
4    Cloves garlic
3    Shallots, peeled and chopped
4    Kemiri (candlenuts)
I find that the easiest and tastiest Sambal Ikan is made with canned
tuna fish. Sambal made with eel, however, is also delicious; cut the
eel up very small and wash it in vinegar. In Indonesia we make this
sambal with ikan teri or ikan bilis (tiny dried anchovies).

Pound the garlic, shallots, kemiri and cabe rawit into a paste. Fry
this paste in vegetable oil in a wok for about half a minute. Put in
the tuna fish, eel or teri; stir-fry for 1 minute and add the
tamarind water, or tomato puree, sugar and salt. Stir in the santen,
and go on simmering until the mixture becomes thick. This sambal can
be served hot or cold.
