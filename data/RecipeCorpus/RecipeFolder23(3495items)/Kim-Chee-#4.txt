Yield: 1 servings
2 ts Korean red pepper
1/2 ts Salt, (more or less)
Water
2    Napa cabbages, cut up
1    Scallion
2    Garlic cloves, minced
1    1" piece ginger, minced
Soak cabbages overnight in salt water to wilt.  The next day, wash
cabbage 3 times til there is no more "slimy" feel.  Cut the green
part of the scallion into 1/2" long slivers, and mince the white
part.  Add scallion, garlic and ginger to cabbage.  In a one cup
measuring cup, mix together the red pepper, MSG, salt and water to
make 1/2 cup juice.  Pack cabbage mixture loosely into jars.  Pour
juice in to cover.  Poke with chopstick to release air.  Seal and let
set overnight in refrigerator.  Keep refrigerated. From Judy Alquiza
