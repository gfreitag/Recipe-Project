Categories: Fish, Salsa/sauce, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
4    Unskinned trout or

1 sm Rib celery
1 t  Dried thyme
3 c  Water
1 1/2 t  Salt
2 T  Minced fresh parsley
1/4 c  Court Bouillon
1 t  White-wine vinegar
1 t  Lemon juice
-COURT BOUILLON
1 sm Carrot
1/2    Yellow onion
1 lg Sprig fresh parsley
1/2 c  White wine
-ERB BUTTER SAUCE
2 T  Minced fresh chives
1/2 t  Tarragon
1/4 c  White wine
6 T  Butter
-Salt and pepper
Court Bouillon:  Peel the carrot and cut into thin slices.  Cut
celery and onion into thin slices.  In a non-reactive pot, combine
all of the ingredients; bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 20
minutes. You should have about 3 cups.  Court Bouillon can be made
several days ahead, or it can be frozen.

COOKING AND SERVING: Bring Court Bouillon to a simmer.  Put the
fillets, skin side down, into the simmering liquid, lower heat, and
poach gently until fish is just cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Remove fish from the liquid, peel off the skin, and cover to keep
warm. Strain the Court Bouillon and put 1/4 cup into a small
saucepan. Reserve remaining bouillon for another use.  Add wine and
vinegar to the saucepan and bring to a boil; boil about 3 minutes
until liquid is reduced to 2 tbs. Over the lowest possible heat,
whisk in the butter a bit at a time.  The butter should soften to
make a creamy sauce but should not melt completely. Stir in the
chives, parsley, tarragon, and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. Serve the fish topped with the sauce.

Yield: 4 servings.

NOTE:  The Herb Butter Sauce here is a variation of the traditional
French beurre blanc.  The sauce is rich and powerful, yet also subtle
enough so that it won't overpower the delicate taste of the poached
fish. The trick to making this sauce is to emulsify the butter
without melting it, so that the sauce is creamy.  The acid in the
wine and vinegar aid in the emulsification.  Whisk in the butter, a
tbs at a time, over the lowest possible heat, moving on and off the
heat as necessary.
