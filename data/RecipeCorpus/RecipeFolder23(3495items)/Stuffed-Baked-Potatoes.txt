4    Green onions, minced

6 lg Baking potatoes
1 c  Nonfat plain yogurt
4 T  Blue cheese, crumbled
Preheat the oven to 425.  Wash and dry the potaotes, then pierce a few
times with a fork.  Place on an oven reck and bake for 45 to 60
minutes, or until very soft. Remove from the oven; preheat the
broiler. Let potatoes cool slightly, then cut a wedge equal to a
third of the potato from the top of each, being carful not to break
the skin of the rest of the potato. Remove enough of the interior to
leave a 1/2 inch thickness of potato inside the skin, and mash in a
bowl with yogurt, blue cheese, and green onions. Spoon back into
potato shells, mounding over the top. Sprinkle each with paprika.
Broil for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.

You can add chopped cooked vegetables to the yogurt/cheese to make a
more filling dish.
