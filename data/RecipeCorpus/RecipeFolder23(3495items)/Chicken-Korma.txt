Categories: Indian, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Coarsely chopped coriander
-leaves
1 tb Chopped fresh mint leaves or
-2 tsp dried mint
2 tb Ground coriander
1/2 ts Chili powder
1 ts Salt
3 tb Lemon juice
1/2 c  Plain yogurt
3 c  Water
1/2 c  Blanched almonds
1/2 c  Poppy seeds
1/2 c  Fresh coconut meat
4 md Onions, roughly chopped
1    Inch piece of fresh ginger,
-peeled and roughly chopped
2    Garlic cloves
3 tb Butter, melted
2 1/2 lb Chicken, skinned and cut
-into 8 pieces
Dry-roast the almonds and the poppy seeds in a frying pan or under the
broiler until the nuts are pale golden, then transfer to a food
processor.

Grate the coconut into the processor, then blend to a paste.  Remove
and set aside.

Place the onions, ginger and garlic in the processor and blend to a
paste. Heat the butter in a large, heavy saucepan, add the onion
paste and fry until golden, stirring frequently.  Add the chicken and
fry to a golden color or until all the moisture in the pan has
evaporated.

Meanwhile, blend the coriander leaves and mint to a smooth paste.
Add all the spices, the salt and the lemon juice and blend together.
Add this mixture to the chicken in the pan and fry, stirring
frequently, for about 10 minutes so that the chicken is well coated
with the spices.  Add the coconut mixture and stir in well.

Add the yogurt a little at a time to the chicken, stirring
continuously to blend it into the mixture.  Continue stirring for 3 -
5 minutes and fry until the butter begins to separate.

Pour in just enough water to cover the chicken, cover the pan, reduce
the heat and allow to cook for another 20 - 30 minutes or until the
chicken is really tender.  Transfer to a warmed serving dish and
serve hot.
