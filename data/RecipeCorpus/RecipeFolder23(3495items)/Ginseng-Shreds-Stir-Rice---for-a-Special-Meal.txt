Title: Ginseng Shreds Stir Rice - for a Special Meal
Categories: Chinese, Rice
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Salt
3    Onions shredded
3    Sweet peppers shredded
1 lb Celery
9 c  Presteamed rice
2 oz Finely chopped Ginseng
2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Vegetable oil
Steam and simmer rice. Use 1 heaping tablespoon vegetable oil and
stir rice in a skillet over a big fire for 1 or 2 minutes. Take out
the rice.

Heat the remaining vegetable oil over a big fire until hot. Put in
finely chopped Ginseng, onions, peppers, celery and salt and stir for
2 minutes. Let sit, covered, for 7 minutes. Then it's ready.

Almost all Chinese soups and stews are adaptable to Ginseng, with the
exception of those having citrus fruits as an ingredient. I've given
you a start here, but experiment. Dig up a Chinese cookbook and try
out a few recipes.
