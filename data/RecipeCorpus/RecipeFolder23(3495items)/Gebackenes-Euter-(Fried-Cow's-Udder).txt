Title: Gebackenes Euter (Fried Cow's Udder)
Categories: German
Yield: 4 servings
100 g  Butter (7 Tbsp)
Salt
Pepper
500 g  Cow's udder (a generous lb)
1    Egg, beaten
Plain breadcrumbs
In order to remove all traces of milk, put the udder into lukewarm
water and let soak for 2 to 4 hours, permitting the water to cool
off.  Then cook the udder in a 2-percent to 3- percent salt water
solution until tender. Remove from the cooking liquid and cut into
1/2-inch thick slices.  Let the slices dry a bit.  Season on both
sides, dip into whisked egg, and then into breadcrumbs.  Fry in
butter, turning once, until golden brown on both sides.

Serve with lettuce.

Serves 4.
