~-- Heat oil in a Dutch oven and saute onions 3 minutes.  Add cabbage
and immediately pour vinegar over cabbage to prevent it from losing
its red color.  Sprinkle with salt and sugar.  Add chopped apple or
applesauce and a piece of salt pork.  Pour in red wine and hot beef
broth.  Cover and simmer for 45 to 60 minutes.  Cabbage should be
just tender, not soft. Shortly before end of cooking time, remove
salt pork; cube and retrun it to the cabbage if desired.  Correct
seasonings and serve.
