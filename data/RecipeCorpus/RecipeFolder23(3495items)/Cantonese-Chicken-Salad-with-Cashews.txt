IN A WOK OR SMALL SAUCEPAN heat the oil to 375F. Pull noodles apart
into 4 small batches. Add 1 small handful at a time into the hot oil.
They should puff within a few seconds. If they do not, the oil is not
hot enough. With chopsticks or tongs, remove noodles and drain on
paper towel. Repeat with the remaining noodles. Lightly crumble
noodles. Makes about 4 cups. In a small bowl, blend thoroughly the
mustard, water, sugar and salt; set aside for at least 10 minutes.
Open the cavity of the roast chicken; pour out the juices and add
them to any juices accompanying the chicken. Strain and degrease the
juice. Mix 4 tablespoons of the strained juice with soy sauce,
vinegar and sesame oil; set aside. Remove the chicken meat from the
bones. Hand shred by tearing the meat into 1/4-by-2-inch-long shreds.
Cut skin into 1 1/2-inch long thin slivers. In a large bowl mix
together the skin, chicken and reserved mustard mixture. Add the
green onions, coriander, sesame seeds and reserved roasting juice
mixture; toss together like a salad. Just before serving, add lettuce
and cashews; toss together. Arrange over a bed of crumbled rice stick
noodles. Serve at room temperature.
