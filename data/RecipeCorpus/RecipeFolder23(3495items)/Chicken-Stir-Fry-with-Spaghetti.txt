Remove chicken meat from bones in large pieces.  Shred meat into 1-
inch long pieces.  You should have 2 cups.

In a large kettle or saucepot, start cooking pasta in boiling water
following package directions for al dente stage.

While pasta is cooking, whisk together egg whites with 3 tablespoons
of the cornstarch and the garlic in medium bowl.  Add the chicken
shreds; toss to coat.  Let stand for 5 minutes.

In another bowl, smooth the remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch with
part of the water.  Stir in remaining water, vinegar, soy sauce, and
red pepper flakes; set aside.

Coat a large wok or heavy skillet with the oil.  Heat over medium-
high heat until the oil begins to sizzle.  Lift chicken pieces from
egg white mixture, letting excess drip back into bowl.  Stir-fry
until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Lift out with slotted spoon to
paper towels. Wipe out wok or skillet.

Place wok over medium heat.  Whisk the reserved cornstarch/soy mixture
again and pour into wok.  Bring mixture just to a boil.  Add
mushrooms and onions.  Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce
thickens, about 3 minutes. Add the cooked chicken pieces and heat,
stirring constantly, until chicken and vegetables are glistening and
mixture is hot.

Drain pasta and place on a large serving platter.  Top with the
chicken/vegetable mixture.
