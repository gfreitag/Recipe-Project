Categories: Asian, Condiment
Yield: 1 servings
1 lg Head Chinese Cabbage
2 sm Heads Regular Cabbage
3 1/2 tb Garlic Salt
1 1/2 tb Paprika
4 tb Dried Red Pepper Flakes
20 lg Green Bell Peppers
4 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Salt
4    Heads Garlic
3 tb MSG Or Accent
1 lb Carrots
2 lg Bunches Green Onions
Clean the kitchen sink as this is where you will be working.  Cut the
regular cabbage into 2 to 3 inch pieces.  Place the cabbage in the
sink and add the salt.  Work in the salt using a kneading motion,
until the cabbage is broken up.  The Chinese cabbage should now be
cut up and added; no kneading required.  Let this stand for 5 to 10
minutes and then rinse once or twice and drain well.  Shred the
carrots, with a potato peeler or a fine food processor shreder.  Cut
the green onions into 2 inch pieces, using all of the onions.  Cut
the green peppers into 1/2 inch lengths. Grind up the red pepper and
the garlic heads in a blender.  Blend the garlic into the mixture one
clove at a time, using 3 to 4 heads, depending on the size of the
heads.  Mix the ground up garlic and red pepper mixture, paprika,
garlic salt and sugar.  Blend this mixture into the cabbage. Mix well
until all of the Chinese cabbage is tinted red.  Add small amounts of
water as you mix to keep the cabbage moist.  Taste and add more salt
if necessary, about 1 tb at a time; add more garlic salt instead if
more garlic is also needed.  Add about 3/4 cup of water; press into a
1 gallon jug, glass is best.  Leave outside refrigeration for 48 to
72 hours. This is necessary for fermentation.  Refrigerate after
fermentation period. Hints: For fermentation, leave the jug in the
garage or other place outside the house; it really smells.  Also,
don't seal the lid on the jug, it might explode.
