Title: Huachinango a la Veracruzana
Categories: Seafood, Tex/mexican
Yield: 4 servings
1    Bay leaf
1/4 ts Oregano
12    Olive, green; halved
2 tb Capers
2    Jalape¤os en escabeche
1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Olive oil
1    Snapper, 3 lb
1 ts Salt
2 tb Lime juice
2 lb Tomato
1/4 c  Olive oil
1    Onion; finely sliced
2    Garlic clove
Slice the onions finely.  Peel and slice the garlic.  Cut the
jalape¤os into strips.  Set them all aside.

Clean the fish, leaving the head and tail on.  Prick the fish on both
sides with a coarse-tined fork, rub in the salt and lime juice, and
set aside in the dish to season for about two hours.

Skin, seed, and chop the tomatoes roughly.  Set them aside.

Heat the oil and fry the onion and garlic, without browning, until
they are soft.  Add the tomatoes, with the bay leaf, oregano, olives,
capers, jalape¤os, and salt to the pan and cook the sauce over a
brisk flame until it is well seasoned and some of the juice has
evaporated--about ten minutes.  Pour the sauce over the fish.

Sprinkle the olive oil over the sauce and bake the fish for about
twenty minutes, uncovered, on one side.  Turn the fish over and
continue baking it until it is just tender--about 30 minutes.  Baste
the fish frequently with the sauce during the cooking time.
