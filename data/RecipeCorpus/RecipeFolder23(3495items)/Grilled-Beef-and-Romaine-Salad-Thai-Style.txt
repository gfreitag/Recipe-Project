Prepare a charcoal or other grill for cooking the meat. This should
be done before starting to prepare the ingrediences. Thinly slice the
cucumbers and radishes. Cut scallions into 1-inch lengths. Prepare
all the greens as indicated and combine in a salad bowl. Brush meat
with oil.

Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill meat on both sides, about 2
minutes to a side or longer, depending on the desired degree of
doneness.

Quickly, while the meat is still hot, cut the slices into 1/2 inch
strips and add them to the greens. If there are any accumulated meat
juices, add them to the sauce. Pour the sauce over all and toss.
Serve immediately with hot rice or long loaves of bread. NOTE: Either
Nuoc nam (Vietnamese fish sauce) or Nam pla) Thai fish sauce may be
used in this recipe. Fish sauce and powdered red chiles are widely
available in Chinese markets.
