Categories: Can/preserv
Yield: 6 servings
9    Clove garlic
1/4 lb Parsley, sour cherry and/or
-black currant leaves
3 1/2 tb Salt, non-iodized per 2 qts
-water
24    Cucumber, medium pickling
-3-4" long, 1 1/4" thick
1 oz Horseradish root
1    Dill, bunch mature plants
-with seeds
Prepare the cucumbers following the instructions for Brined Cucumbers.

Rinse the dill and divide in half. Scrub and rinse the horseradish and
slice thinly.  Peel and halve the garlic.  Wash the various leaves.

Fold half of the dill into a ring and place in the bottom of the jar.
Strew half the horseradish and garlic and 1/3 of leaves on top.
Arrange half of pickles upright, packing them tightly.  Place 1/3 of
the leaves on top, then pack in the rest of the cucumbers in the same
manner. Top with layers of the remaining horseradish, dill, garlic,
and leaves.

Combine the salt and water, stirring until the salt dissolves (the
percenteage of salt in this brine is 2.8-3.0 percent).  Pour the
brine into the jar.  The contents should be fully covered.  Place the
saucer inside the jar with a weight (small rock?). Cover the mouth of
the jar with 2 layers of cheesecloth and secure with string.

Leave for 3-4 days in cool, airy room whose temperature is about 64-68
degrees.

Remove the scum as it appears and wash the mouth of the jar daily.
After 3-4 days, when most active fermentation has subsided a little,
remove weight and lid.  cover jar with its own lid and refrigerate.
In 1 2 days the malossol cucumbers will be ready to eat.  Because
there is less salt in the brine than Brined Cucumbers, malossol
cucumbers should be eaten sooner.

Store the pickles on the lowest shelf of the refrigerator for 4-5
days, after which they will become either too salty (and turn into
regular brined cucumbers) or, more likely, too soft and almost mushy.
