Squeeze out all liquid and mince fine. Chop mushroom. Mix soy sauce,
sesame oil, Mirin, pork, green onion, ginger, mushroom, and cabbage.
Refrigerate for 1 hour or more.

Place a scant teaspoon of mixture on each gyoza skin. Moisten edges
with cornstarch and water, fold over and seal. Crimp edges with a
fork. Cover bottom of a large non-stick skillet (electric is good)
with oil. Brown the gyoza over medium heat (350 degrees) turning
frequently. Add 1/4 c water to skillet- let, cover and steam on low
heat 7 minutes. Stir often to prevent sticking. Remove cover, raise
heat and cook for 2 minutes until crisp.

Place sauce on table in small individual bowls. Gyoza may be prepared
in advance or frozen. Lay them in a single layer on a greased cookie
sheet, and cover with greased paper. Thaw before cooking.

"Pot Stickers" are usually served as a first course. They are also
excellent as an appetizer.

Suggestion: Egg Drop Soup and "Pot Stickers", followed by Beef and
Oyster Sauce a crisp green vegetable and hot Chinese tea.
