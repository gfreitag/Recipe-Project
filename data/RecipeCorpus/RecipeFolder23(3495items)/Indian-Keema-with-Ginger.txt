The word, "Keema" refers to almost any ground meat casserole in Indian
cuisine.

Spices are sold or in shops specializing in Indian foods. If it is not
available, substitute curry powder or curry paste and add it along
with the tumeric and salt)

Heat the oil in a skillet and add the onions. Cook, stirring, about 10
minutes, or til they are caramel colored.  Add the garlic, ginger and
chiles and cook 2 minutes longer. Add the ground meat and cook,
stirring and chopping with the side of a heavy metal spoon to break
up any lumps. Cook until the meat loses its raw look and starts to
brown. Sprinkle with tumeric and salt and stir. Add the water, cover
and cook over low heat about 25 minutes, stirring often to prevent
browning and sticking. When ready, all the liquid should be absorbed.
If it is not, uncover and cook till all liquid is evaporated. Stir in
the garum masala, lemon juice and coriander.
