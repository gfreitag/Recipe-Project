aside. 2. In a large skillet, melt 2 tbs of the butter in the water.
add the shallots or scallions, celery, bell pepper or pimento, and
mustard. Simmer over medium heat until the shallots are limp and the
vegetables have absorbed the butter. Do not allow them to sizzle or
brown the least bit. 3. Add the remaining butter, the parsley, bread
crumbs, and crabmeat or shrimp. Mix with a fork - gently, to keep the
dressing light and porous. Season to taste with salt and cayenne. Add
Tabasco and the lemon juice. Makes about 3 cups.

VARIATION: Pontchartrain Dressing with Capers: Omit the shallots or
scallions and the bell or pimento pepper. Substitute 2 to 3 tbs
drained capers and 2 chopped canned pimentos. Use less Tabasco, but
still add the same amount of lemon juice.
