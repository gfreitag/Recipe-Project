Karen Mintzias
1    Rabbit or hare
-- cleaned and skinned
2    Celery stalks, with leaves,
-- chopped
2 md Onions; chopped
1    Carrot; sliced
1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
1    Bay leaf; crumbled
2    Sprigs fresh rosemary
After washing the rabbit or hare thoroughly and cutting into serving
pieces, place in a large glass or earthenware bowl.  Make a marinade
by combining the celery, onions, carrots, herbs, peppercorns, wine,
and vinegar and pouring over the meat.  Cover and refrigerate for a
day or two, turning the pieces over occasionally.

On serving day, drain, reserving the marinade, and wipe dry.
Transfer the marinade to a casserole and simmer for 15 minutes.
While the marinade is cooking, heat the butter in a large frying pan,
and when very hot sear the meat over high heat until it is reddened
in color without browning. Remove from the heat, and with a spatula
lift the rabbit or hare pieces into the simmering marinade, then pour
in the remaining butter.  Taste for seasoning, then add the salt and
pepper, tomatoes, and allspice.  Weight the meat with a small plate
to keep it under the sauce, then bake it in a very slow oven (225 F)
for 2-1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender and the sauce thickened.
