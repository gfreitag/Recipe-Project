This simple cucumber salad is a pleasant accompaniment to a hot summer
night. Small cucumbers are suggested; they are not quite as watery as
the large ones nor do they require peeling.

1.  Slice the cucumbers in circles. Sprinkle salt over the cucumber
slices, mix well and let them stand for 30 minutes. Place the
cucumbers in a damp cloth and gently but firmly squeeze out as much
water as possible. The less watery the cucumbers, the better tasting
the dish.

2.  Crush the garlic, then combine it with the cucumbers, salt, sesame
seeds, sesame oil, pepper and sugar in a bowl. Mix well.
