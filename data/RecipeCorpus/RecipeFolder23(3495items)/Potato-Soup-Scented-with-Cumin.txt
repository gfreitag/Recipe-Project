Title: Potato Soup Scented with Cumin
Categories: Soup/stew, Potato
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Half and half
- or evaporated skim milk
Salt
Fresh ground pepper
4 ts Chopped fresh cilantro
3 tb Unsalted butter
1 c  Chopped shallots
3 lb Red skin potatoes; peeled
- and cut into 3/4" cubes
1 1/2 tb Ground cumin
12 c  Chicken stock
Melt butter in large, heavy, non-aluminum, deep-sided pan over
medium-high heat. When hot add shallots and cook, stirring
constantly, until soft, about 3 minutes. Add potatoes and cumin. Toss
and cook 1 minute more. Add stock. Bring to boil, stirring several
times to prevent potatoes from sticking to pan. Reduce heat and
simmer until potatoes are quite tender, 25 to 30 minutes.

Remove soup from heat and puree, using food processor, blender or food
mill. Return mixture to pan and stir in half and half. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. (Soup can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cool,
cover and refrigerate.)

To serve soup warm, reheat over medium heat, stirring, until hot. To
serve cold, taste chilled soup once again and add salt and pepper if
needed. (Cold foods often require extra seasonings.)

Ladle into 8 bowls and garnish each with 1/2 teaspoon chopped
cilantro. Makes 8 servings.
