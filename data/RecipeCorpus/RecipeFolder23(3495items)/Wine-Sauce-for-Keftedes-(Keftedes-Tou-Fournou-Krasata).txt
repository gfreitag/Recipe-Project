Prepare Keftedes Tiganites, but instead of frying, arrange close
together on a baking pan approximately 8 x 11 x 2-inches.  Bake for
10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small pan combine the tomato sauce, red
wine, bay leaf, cloves, oregano or marjoram, salt and pepper.  Boil
for 5 minutes then pour over the keftedes in the oven.  Reduce the
oven heat to 300 degrees and bake for 40 minutes.  Remove the bay
leaf and cloves and serve warm. From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma
