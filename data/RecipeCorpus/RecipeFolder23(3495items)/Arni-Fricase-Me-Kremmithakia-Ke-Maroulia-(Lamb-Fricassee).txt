Categories: Meat, Main dish, Greek
Yield: 6 servings
3 ea Heads of lettuce
2 tb Dill, chopped (or to taste)
Salt & pepper to taste
2 ea Egg yolks
2 ea Lemons, juice only
5 lb Shoulder or back of lamb
3/4 c  Butter
10 ea Scallions
Water as needed
Coarse salt
Cut lamb into serving-size strips.  Place in pot with the butter.
Clean scallions; chop the white part into small pcs. and the greens
into larger ones (abt. 1 1/2" long); add to meat.  Add 1/2 c. water
and a little coarse salt; cook over med. heat for abt. 1 hr.

Clean lettuce and cut into 2-inch pcs.

As soon as meat has absorbed the water it will begin to brown in
the butter but do not let the scallions brown.  Add dill, lettuce,
salt & pepper.  Cover pot and simmer over low heat for abt. 15 min.
If it is needed, add a little water toward the end of the cooking
time (not in the beginning, because then the lettuce will exude
water).

Beat egg yolks with 2 tb. of water, add the juice from the lemons,
and beat it in well.  Add a little of the liquid from the pot, beating
constantly.  Pour this sauce back into the pot and shake the pot
gently to mix the sauce with the food.  Serve immediately.
