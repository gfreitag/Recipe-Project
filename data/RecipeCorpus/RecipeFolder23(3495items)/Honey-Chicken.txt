Categories: Chinese, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
1    Egg white
2 tb Salt
1 1/2 lb Boneless chicken breasts
- cut in thin strips
2 c  Peanut oil, for deep-frying
4 tb Cornstarch
1/4 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Water
1/2 ts Salt
1    Egg
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1 ts White rice vinegar
1/2 c  Water
1 ts Cornstarch, mixed with
1 ts Water
1 1/2 tb Peanut oil
2 ts Chopped ginger
3 tb Finely sliced garlic
1 ts Salt
3 tb Sugar
MIX THE BATTER INGREDIENTS together in a medium-sized bowl; it should
be thick and smooth. Allow the batter to sit, covered for at least 30
minutes. Combine the chicken with the batter. Heat a wok or large
deep skillet until it is hot and add the oil for frying. When the oil
is barely smoking, deep-fry the chicken for 2 minutes or until the
batter is just firm. You should do this in several batches. Remove
the chicken with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

TO MAKE SAUCE: Heat a small saucepan; when it is hot, add the oil,
ginger and garlic, and stir for 30 seconds. Then add the rest of the
sauce ingredients and simmer for 2 minutes. Keep warm. Reheat the oil
in the wok until it is very hot, but not smoking. Deep-fry the
chicken again until it is golden and crisp, about 1 minute. Remove
and drain, place on a warm platter, drizzle with the sauce and serve
immediately.
