3 cn Green chilis (4-5 oz size)
1/2    Bottle pickled jalepano

5 lg Green peppers (large fist
Chop onions, tomatoes, and peppers to bite sized pieces.  Chop
jalepano peppers into small pieces. Chop chilis into small pieces.
Mix the tomato paste and the water together to make thick sauce. Add
the garlic, cayenne and salt to sauce and mix. Put all the peppers,
onions,and tomatoes into a large oval roaster and slowly cook over
low-med heat. Add the jalapeno's, chili's and sauce with spices in it
and stir until thoroughly mixed. Continue cooking until everything is
JUST heated. Spoon into sterilized quart sealers and process in
boiling water bath for 20 minutes. Makes about 7 quarts.

This makes a medium spicy salsa.  If hotter salsa is desired, adjust
the cayenne and the jalapeno peppers accordingly.  I have used this
not only as a salsa, but also for spaghetti sauce. Just add some
browned, ground meat and some oregano and basil! Voila, instant
spaghetti sauce. This salsa won a ribbon in our Annual Fall Fair for
me! It came in second.....
