onion is transparent. Add beef and stir fry until meat is crumbly and
has lost red color. Add seasonings and let simmer for a few seconds
to develop flavor, then add chili sauce, corn and olives. Cover and
simmer 30 minutes. Meantime, cut up the tortillas, or tear them, and
fry but do not brown, then drain. When meat mixture is ready, start
with a double layer of tortilla pieces in the bottom of a large, well
greased casserole and alternate layers of tortillas, meat mixture and
grated cheese, ending with cheese on top.  Bake uncovered in 350
degree oven for 45 minutes. Garnish with green onions, sprigs of
coriander and sliced radishes.
