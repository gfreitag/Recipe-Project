~-- Prepare Southwest Guacamole and Fresh Tomato Salsa; reserve.
Cook and stir the sausage, onion and the bell pepper strips in a
10-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the
sausage is done, about 10 minutes; drain and reserve.  Heat 1 Tbls of
margarine in a skillet over medium heat until hot and bubbly.  Pour
eggs into skillet.  As the eggs begin to set at the bottom and sides,
gently lift cooked portions with a spatula so that the thin uncooked
portion can flow to the bottom.  Avoid constant stirring.  Cook until
the eggs are thickened throughout, but still moist, about 5 minutes.
Heat the oven to 450 degrees F.  Spoon about 1/4 cup sausage mixture
onto each of the tortillas; top each with about 1/4 cup of the eggs
and 2 Tbls of the cheese mixture.  Fold tortillas into halves.
Arrange 5 assembled tacos in ungreased jelly roll pan 15 1/2 X 10 1/2
X 1-inches; brush with melted margarine.  Bake until light golden
brown, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Repeat with the remaining tacos.
Serve with the guacamole and salsa.
