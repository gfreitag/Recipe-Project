sure edges are not too thin or they will scorch. Elevate plate on to

center. If more cooking time is needed, cook at medium in 25 second
increments, watching closely so that leather does not burn.

Let stand at room temperature overnight to dry.  Repeat with
remaining fruit puree'.  Roll up leathers in plastic wrap.  Store at
room temp up to a week.
