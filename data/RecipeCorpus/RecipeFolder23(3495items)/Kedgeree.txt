Title: Kedgeree
Categories: British, Fish
Yield: 4 servings
-(try brown basmati rice)
3/4 c  Heavy cream
1 1/2 ts Curry powder (or to taste)
1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
Generous grindings of pepper
3 tb Lemon juice
Lime wedges
2    Eggs, hard-cooked
- peeled, chopped fine
1 1/2 c  Flaked finnan haddie
- freshened, boned, skinned,
- (or any smoked fish)
-*** (See NOTE) ***
3 c  Cooked basmati rice
PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Put the eggs, fish and rice in a large mixing
bowl; toss together lightly to mix. Put the cream in a small
saucepan, add the curry powder and nutmeg, heat, stirring until the
spices are blended. Add the cream mixture, pepper, and lemon juice to
the rice mixture, and gently toss. Taste for salt and seasoning and
adjust if needed (the dish won't need any salt if the smoked fish is
salty). Put the Kedgeree in a casserole and heat in oven only until
piping hot. Serve on a platter surrounding softly scrambled eggs, and
garnished with lime wedges.

NOTE: To freshen finnan haddie, soak it in cold milk for an hour,
drain then poach it in fresh milk. The milk sweetens the fish and
tames its saltiness.
