In a heavy 3- to 4-quart casserole, melt the butter in the oil over
moderate heat. When the foam subsides, add the onions, garlic, and the
chilies, and stirring frequently, cook for about 5 minutes, until
they are soft but not brown. Watch carefully for any sign of burning
and regulate the heat accordingly. Add the curry powder and stir for
2 to 3 minutes, then pour in the rice and continue stirring for a few
minutes more, until the grains become somewhat milky and opaque.

Stir in the coconut milk, slat, and a few grindings of peper and
bring to a boil over hgih heat.  Reduce the heat to the lowest
possible point, cover tightly, and simmer undisturbed for 15 minutes.
Add the crab meat, chives, and lime juice, stir gently and simmer,
covered, for 5 minutes longer or until most of the liquid has been
absorbed by the rice and the crab is heated through.

Taste for seasoning, fluff with a fork and serve the crab pilau at
once, mounded on a heated platter.
