1 sm Can Tomato Paste

Freshly Ground Pepper
1 tb Oregano
1 ds Red Pepper Flakes
1/4 ts Nutmeg -- freshly grated
In a small skillet or frypan, fry the bacon.  Drain off the fat as it
accumulates in the pan.  Remove from skillet when bacon is leathery
but not yet crisp. Distribute bacon on one or two paper towels, roll
them up, and give them a good squeeze so the paper absorbs most of
the remaining bacon fat.  Set aside.  Heat the oil in a deep, heavy
non-aluminum kettle (an enameled cast iron casserole or large skillet
will do) and add the vegetables.  Cook, stirring, over low heat until
the onions are translucent and the vegetables are softened. Add the
beef, using a wooden spoon to break up any lumps. Cook only until the
meat loses its raw red color. Do not let it brown.  Add the cooked
bacon, broth, and wine, raise the heat, and cook until the sauce
thickens a little. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper,
oregano, pepper flakes, and nutmeg, and stir well. Taste and adjust
the seasonings. When the sauce begins to bubble, lower the heat and
simmer very slowly, partly covered, for about 4 hours. Stir
occasionally to prevent sticking. Before serving, taste again for
seasoning and adjust.

This sauce freezes well and keeps for about a week in the
refrigerator. If you cannot find lean ground beef, pick out a round
steak or some sirloin and have the butcher trim and grind it for you.
