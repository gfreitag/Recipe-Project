Categories: Soups, Low-fat/low
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Water
1    Chicken bouillon cube
3 c  Broccoli flowerets --
Chopped
24 oz Evaporated skim milk
Light Vegetable Oil Spray
1 1/2 c  Leek -- chopped-white part
(2-3 leeks)
2 tb All-purpose Flour
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1    Garlic clove -- peeled &
Mince
3 tb Fresh basil -- chopped
Freshly ground black pepper
To taste
Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
Dissolve the bouillon cube in the boiling water. Add the broccoli and
cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until it is bright green and fork tender.

Put the evaporated milk in a small saucepan.  Warm over low heat, just
until bubbles begin to form around the edge. Remove the pan from the
heat.

Preheat a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat for about 1 minute.
Spray it twice with the vegetable oil. Add the leeks and saute,
stirring often, for 7 to 8 minutes, until limp. Stir in the flour and
cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the warm evaporated milk. Continue to
cook, whisking constantly, until the flour has dissolved and the
mixture is smooth.

Reduce the heat to low.  Add the nutmeg, the garlic, and the broccoli,
along with its cooking liquid. Simmer for 5 minutes more, taking care
not to bring the soup to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and
stir in the basil and black pepper.
