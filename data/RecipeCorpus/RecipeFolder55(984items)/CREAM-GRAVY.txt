Title: CREAM GRAVY
Categories: Breakfast, Meats, Sauces
Garlic 2 tb Butter or
Salt and pepper 1/4 c Flour 2 c Milk
Yield: 1 Lot  1 lb Pork sausage (spiced)
sausage grease

Cook sausage and drain.  Then, either retain a portion of the
drippings or melt the butter and add the flour. Let simmer a while
and then add the milk.  Let heat until starch gelatinization occurs
(gets thick). Season to your liking --the more pepper, salt and
garlic, the better. Be careful not to scorch the gravy. Add sausage
to gravy after thickened to your desired consistency.  If it doesn't
get thick enough, add some more flour (dispersed in milk or water).
