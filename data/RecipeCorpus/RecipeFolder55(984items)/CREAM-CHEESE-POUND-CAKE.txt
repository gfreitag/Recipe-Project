Title: CREAM CHEESE POUND CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Cake
3/4 lb Butter
3 c  Sugar, granulated
1/2 lb Cream cheese
6 lg Eggs
3 c  Cake flour, sifted
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Almond extract
1 ts Vanilla extract
Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees F.  Cream the butter, sugar and cheese
together until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add salt, vanilla and
almond extract. Beat well. Add eggs, one at a time, blending well
after each.

Stir in flour.  Don't be vigorous; mix it just enough to incorporate
the flour.  Spoon into a greased tube pan. Bake in preheated oven for
1 1/2 hours.  Cool for 15-20 minutes, then invert the cake onto a
serving dish and remove the tube pan. If you wait too long, it will
stick.
