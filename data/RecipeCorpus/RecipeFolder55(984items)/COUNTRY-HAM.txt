Title: COUNTRY HAM
Categories: Meats
Yield: 16 Servings
1    Country ham (12-15 lb)
- scrubbed,
- soaked 1 to 2 days,
- changing water after
- 4 hours, then daily
10 sl Ginger (size of a quarter)
1 ts Peppercorns
1/2 ga Apple cider
1 ga Water
1 c  Chunky applesauce
3 tb Dijon mustard
1 tb Prepared horseradish
1 c  Dark brown sugar
1 c  Bread crumbs
PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. Place ham in a large pan, fat-side up. Add
sliced ginger and peppercorns, then add enough cider and water to
come 2-to-3 inches up the side of the ham. Save remaining cider-water
to add to pan as liquid evaporates. Cover and place in oven. Cook
about 20 minutes per pound or until internal temperature registers
160F. Remove from oven halfway through cooking and turn ham over.
Replace and continue cooking. Remove ham to broiler rack and let sit
10 minutes to cool. Remove skin and fat. Taste, and if it's very
salty, it may safely be immersed in more apple cider and water to
draw out more salt. Taste again and proceed. You may refrigerate
until ready to glaze. Increase oven temperature to 400F. Mix the
applesauce, mustard, horseradish, and 1/2 cup of the brown sugar.
Spread over ham. Bake 20 minutes or until ham is heated through and
sauce is bubbly. Remove from oven and turn on broiler. Mix together
remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar and bread crumbs and spread on ham.
Broil 5 minutes or until crisp.
