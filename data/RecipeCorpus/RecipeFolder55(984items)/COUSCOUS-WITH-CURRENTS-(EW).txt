Title: COUSCOUS WITH CURRENTS (EW)
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  Couscous
1/2 c  Dried currents
1/2 ts Salt, plus more to taste
6    Ripe plum tomatoes
3    Cloves garlic, unpeeled
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
3 tb Olive oil, preferably extra
-virgin
1 ts Dijon mustard
1/4 ts Sugar
Freshly gound black pepper
-to taste
1/2 c  Finely chopped scallions
-5 scallions
1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
In a large bowl, stir together 3 cups lukewarm water, couscous,
currants and salt.  Let stand for 30 minutes, or until the water has
been absorbed and the couscous is tender.

Meanwhile, dip tomatoes into boiling water for a few second, refresh
under cold water and slip off skins. Cut the tomatoes in half
crosswise, remove seeds, dice and set aside.

Heat a cast iron or heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Add
garlic cloves and cook, turning occasionally until blackened in spots
and tender, about 10 minutes.  Slip the garlic cloves from their
skins and trim the tough ends.

In a blender or food processor, combine lemon juice, olive oil,
mustard, sugar and the roasted garlic; blend until smooth. Season
with salt and pepper.

Fluff the couscous with a fork.  Add scallions, parsley and the diced
tomatoes.  Drizzle with the lemon dressing and toss lightly to coat.
Taste and adjust seasonings. Serve within 2 hours.
