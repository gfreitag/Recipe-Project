==================
Bring a large kettle of water to a boil over high heat. Add coarse
salt and potatoes; cook until potatoes are nearly tender but still
firm in center, about 15 minutes.
In large bowl, whisk olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Drain
potatoes, and when they are cool enough to handle, cut into 1-inch
cubes. Place potatoes in bowl with vinaigrette, toss until coated
with mixture; let cool.
When potatoes are cool, add celery, onions, pickles and olives;
toss until thoroughly incorporated.
In small bowl, mix mayonnaise with cayenne pepper; add to potato
mixture.  Toss until all vegetables are coated with mayonnaise.
Add eggs to salad and toss gently.  Chill 1 to 2 hours before
serving.
