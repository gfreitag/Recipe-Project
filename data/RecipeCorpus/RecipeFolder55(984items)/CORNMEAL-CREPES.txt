1/2 bn cilantro -- chopped
4 lg eggs

In a blender, place the chiles and cilantro. Add the eggs, water,
milk, salt, baking powder, cornmeal, flour, sugar, and oil. Blend
until very smooth. Let the batter rest at room temperature 30 minutes
to 1 hour. Heat an 8 to 9inch, wellseasoned crepe pan or small
skillet over a medium heat. Coat with a little vegetable oil. When
the pan is hot, pour in about 2 to 3 ounces of the crepe batter. Tilt
the pan, rotating so the batter is evenly distributed. Cook until the
crepe appears dry, then turn and cook on the other side. Repeat until
all the batter is used. Store the crepes between sheets of wax paper
until ready to use. 10/16/96 show Copyright, 1996, TV FOOD NETWORK,
