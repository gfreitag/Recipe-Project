Here's a recipe that harkens back to one of culinary America's
mainstays, Lipton Soup.  Along with hamburgers, "soup cooking" may
well be the US' major contribution to the world's cuisines. I have
not tried this yet, but I will.  It appeals to my red, white and blue
lil' ol' heart... And how bad could it be with herbs and garlic,
anyway?

Preheat oven to 375F.  In 13 x 9-inch baking pan, arrange chicken. In
small bowl, combine remaining ingredients; brush on chicken. Bake for
45 minutes or until chicken is done.

Makes about 4 servings.
