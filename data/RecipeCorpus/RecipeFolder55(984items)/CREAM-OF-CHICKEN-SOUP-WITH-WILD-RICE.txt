Title: CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP WITH WILD RICE
Categories: Soups
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/3 c  (8 oz) uncooked wild rice
3 lb Broiler-fryer chicken,
-cut up
7 c  Water
12 oz Sliced mushrooms
2 tb Cooking oil
1 c  Chopped onion
1 c  Chopped celery
2 tb Instant chicken bouillon
-granules
3/4 ts White pepper
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Butter
3/4 c  Flour
4 c  Milk
3/4 c  Dry white wine
Cook wild rice according to pkg. directions for 30 minutes; drain off
liquid and rinse. Set partially cooked rice aside.

In a large Dutch oven or stockpot, combine the chicken and water and
bring to boiling. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 35 to 40 minutes
or until chicken is tender. Remove chicken from broth and let stand
until cool enough to handle. Skim fat from broth. Strain and reserve
broth. Remove chicken meat from bones. Cut into bite-size pieces.

In the same pot, cook mushrooms in hot oil for 4 to 5 minutes or until
tender.

Add onion and celery.  Cover and cook for 5 to 10 minutes or until
tender, stirring once (I'd probably do the onion and celery first,
until transluscent, and then add mushrooms and cover and cook).
Remove from heat. Return broth to the stock pot.

Add partially cooked wild rice to the chicken broth. Stir in the
granules, white pepper and salt.  Bring to boiling and then reduce
heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes.

In a large saucepan, melt the butter and stir in the flour until
smooth. Add milk all at once. Cook and stir until bubbly. Stir into
soup mixture. Stir in the chicken pieces and wine, and heat through.
Makes 8 servings.
