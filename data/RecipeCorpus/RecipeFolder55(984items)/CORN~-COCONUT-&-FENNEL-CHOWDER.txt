Saute the onions, leeks, garlic, fennel seed, pepper flakes and
chiles in olive oil until vegetables are crisply cooked but not
brown, about 5 minutes. In a separate pot add corn cobs to chicken
stock and simmer for 10 - 15 minutes covered. Strain and add stock to
vegetable mixture.

Dissolve the cornstarch in the coconut milk and add to broth along
with the lime zest. Simmer for 5 minutes. Add corn kernels and fennel
and warm through. Correct seasoning and stir in the cilantro just
before serving. Thin, if desired, with additional stock.

Garnish with cilantro or mint leaves and finely diced red bell
peppers.
