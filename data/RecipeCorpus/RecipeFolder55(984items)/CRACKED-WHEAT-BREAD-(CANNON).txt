Title: CRACKED WHEAT BREAD (CANNON)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Loaves
2 c  Warm milk
1 c  Wheat bran cereal (All-Bran,
-Fiber 1, or 100% Bran)
1/2 c  Warm water
2 tb Yeast
1/3 c  Honey
2 tb Olive oil or vegetable oil
2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Cracked wheat
3 c  Whole wheat flour
2 1/2 c  To 3 1/2 c bread flour (or
-all purpose flour)
In a large bowl, add wheat bran cereal to milk and soak 15-30 minutes.
Proof yeast in warm water.

Add yeast mixture, honey, olive oil, salt, and cracked wheat to milk
mixture and mix well. Add the whole wheat flour, one cup at a time,
mixing well after each addition. Then add bread flour 1/2 c at a
time, mixing well after each addition. When dough gets very stiff,
turn out onto a well-floured surface and knead in enough remaining
flour to make a good soft dough.

Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let
rise until doubled. Punch down, divide in half, and form each half
into a loaf and place in a 8.5x4.5 inch or 9x5 inch bread pan and
cover. Let rise until doubled in bulk.

Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 30 minutes, remove from pans
and continue to bake for another 10-15 minutes until bread sounds
hollow on bottom. May need to cover tops with aluminum foil during
final 10-15 minutes of baking if top is browning too much. Let cool
on racks before slicing.
