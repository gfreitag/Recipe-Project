Peel the onion, cut it lengthwise into 8 wedges, then slice the
wedges very thinly crosswise. Heat the olive oil and butter in a
large non-stick saute pan and saute the onion, with a little salt,
until it is lightly browned.

Add the vegetable broth and the dried cranberries and bring the broth

and leave covered for another 2-3 minutes, then fluff up the couscous
with a fork and serve.
