Title: CRAB & ASPARAGUS QUICHE
Categories: Shellfish, Seafood, Pies
Yield: 4 Servings
1    8" pate brisee or
-regular pie crust
1 c  Crab meat, chopped
1 3/4 c  Milk, scalded
3    Eggs, beaten
10    Asparagus spears,
-tips reserved
4 oz Parmesan cheese
ds Nutmeg and cayenne pepper
Salt to taste
Preheat oven to 375. Place crab meat in bottom of pastry shell. Cut
bottom parts of asparagus spears into half-inch slices and scatter
over crab. Scatter parmesan over asparagus. Beat eggs and milk
together, and season to taste with nutmeg, cayenne and salt. Pour
over crab/asparagus mixture. Arrange reserved asparagus tips in a
spoke-like pattern on top. Bake in preheated oven until set (about 45
minutes to an hour). Let sit for about 15 minutes before serving.
Next time, I might substitute Swiss cheese for at least part of the
Parmesan (didn't have any handy, and at 1 ayem, wasn't gonna make a
run to Kroger to get any).
