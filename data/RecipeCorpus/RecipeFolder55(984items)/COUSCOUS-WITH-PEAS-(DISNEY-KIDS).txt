NOTES : Reviewed in "Vegetables your kids will eat," Family Fun
Magazine, May 1996.  Originating in North Africa, this fine,
grainlike cereal cooks even faster than rice or potatoes. You can
serve it plain, embellish it with peas and onion as it is here, or
experiment with just about any fresh herb or chopped vegetable such
as tomatoes and peppers. Recipe By : Deanna Cook, 1996. Disney's
