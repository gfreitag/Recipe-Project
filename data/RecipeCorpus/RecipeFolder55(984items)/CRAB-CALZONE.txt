Title: CRAB CALZONE
Categories: Main dish, Appetizers, Seafood
Yield: 1 Recipe
1 pk Hot roll mix
1 1/4 c  Hot water
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 c  Ricotta cheese
1 c  Grated mozzarella cheese
8 oz Cream cheese; softened
1/2 lb Crab meat
4    Green onions; chopped
1    Garlic clove; minced fine
1 sm Can chopped olives
1 tb Chopped parsley; OR...
1 ts -dried parsley
In large bowl, combine flour mixture and yeast from hot roll mix.
Stir in water and oil until moistened. Turn dough out onto lightly
floured surface. With greased hands, shape into ball and knead dough
3 minutes or until no longer sticky. Divide dough into 10 equal parts
and cover loosely with plastic wrap and cloth towel.

In medium bowl, combine remaining ingredients and mix well. On lightly
floured surface, roll each ball of dough to an eight inch circle.
Spoon 1/3 cup filling over half of dough to within 1" of edge. Brush
edge with water. Fold dough in half over filling, press edges to seal
and flute decoratively. Place on greased cookie sheet, and brush with
oil. Bake 400 degrees F. for 25-30 minutes, or until brown.

Variation: Turn the calzone from a main dish to an appetizer by
wrapping 1 tablespoon of the filling in fillo dough wrappers.
