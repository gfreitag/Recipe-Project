Title: CRAIG GARDINER'S BUFFALO WINGS
Categories: Appetizers, Poultry, Hot
Yield: 1 Appetizer
MMMMM-------------------GRAIG GARDINER KNHT09A------------------------
1 c  Cajun hot sauce
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
1 tb Vinegar (more in proportion)
Chicken wings; trim tips
Flour
Salt/pepper
Combine hot sauce, with oil and vinegar.  Trim the wing tips and then
poke each wint in 3-4 places with a a heavy kitchen fork. Marinate
wings in sauce for 2-3 days in the refrigerator, covered. When ready
to cook, drain in a colander, reserving liquid. Shake wings in a bag
of flour seasoned with salt and pepper, and arrange on a lightly
oiled heavy baking sheet. Bake 1 hour at 350 degrees, turning several
times until done and crispy. Drain on paper towels.  They can be done
on a rack but not under the broiler because the flour will burn.
Don't try deep frying them because the moisture content is too high.
They are good cold and also reheat well.

You can bring the hot sauce to a full boil and save for reuse, but
not more than once because it weakens in flavor. This is just a
different approach but I thought you might find it interesting. Craig
