grams fat, 2 grams protein, 27 grams carbohydrate, 23 mg cholesterol,
126 mg sodium   NOTE: listed ingredients & variations would be
slightly different.

Preheat oven to 400 F and spray at least 12 muffin cups lined with
paper baking cups.  Low-fat muffins tend to stick even to non-stick
pans.

Measure 1/2 tbsp lemon juice in a measuring cup, fill to about 1/4
cup mark with fluid milk and add some skim milk powder to make it a
little thicker. Set aside.

Combine dry ingredients in a bowl.

Add remaining ingredients of your choice and stir until they are just
combined.  Bake about 20 minutes or until lightly browned and firm to
the touch. Adjust time if muffins are made smaller.

VARIATIONS, substitute for cranberry: Banana-Date - use 1 cup mashed
banana and 1/2 cup dates or raisins. If 2 bananas are not quite 1 cup,
concentrated orange juice or orange/pineapple may be added. (Tested
Jan 94 by Elizabeth Rodier, family member ate 2 warm ones.)

Apple-Raisin - 1 cup applesauce plus 1/2 cup raisins, or coarsely
chop an unpeeled apple in a food processor.

Zucchini - 1 cup grated unpeeled zucchini plus 1/2 cup raisins.

May be made as 16-18 small muffins or 9 inch square cake cut in the
desired number of pieces.  For a diabetic meal plan, reduce the
amount of sugar to 1/4 cup or 1 tsp. per serving (recommended
guideline of American Diabetes Assoc.)

This recipe is typical of healthy heart recipes with reduced sodium,
cholesterol and fat but more sugar than a typical diabetic recipe.
