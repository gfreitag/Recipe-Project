Categories: Sauces, Fruits/nuts, Holiday
Yield: 1 Servings
1/3 c  Pure maple syrup
2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 c  Cranberries
- if frozen, do not thaw
3 tb Unsalted butter

BRING THE MAPLE SYRUP and sugar to a boil in a small non-aluminum
pan, then cook for 3 minutes. Add the cranberries and cook until
their skins burst and they begin to pop, 6-to-8 minutes, or slightly
longer if they are frozen. Cut the butter into 3 pieces. Remove the
pan from the heat and whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time, waiting
until each is incorporated before adding another. Add the bourbon.
Sauce can be served immediately or refrigerated for up to a week.
Reheat gently and thin with 2 to 3 tablespoons water before serving.
Makes 1 1/4 Cups
