2 c  Flour
8 oz Package cream cheese,

1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  White vinegar
3    Or 4 jalapeno peppers,

Place flour in bowl of food processor.  With processor running, drop

(Alternatively, mix the cream cheese and butter in a large mixing
bowl by hand or with electric beater. Slowly blend in flour until
dough is formed.)

Wrap dough in wax paper or plastic wrap.  Chill for at least one hour.

While the dough is freezing, make the cranberry mixture:

Place the water and vinegar in a 3-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil
and let boil 5 minutes.

Add the jalapeno peppers and the sugar.  Return to a boil and let
boil 5 minutes.

Mix in the cranberries.  Return to a boil and let boil
5    minutes.

Remove from the heat and pour onto jelly roll pan. Chill for at least
one hour.

When ready to assemble the cookies:

Dust work surface with confectioners' sugar.  Working with a small
chunk of dough, roll dough to about 1/4" thick. Cut dough into 2"
squares. You can re-use the dough scraps.

Place dough squares on cookie sheet sprayed with vegetable oil spray
(do not *grease* the pan or you'll have a real mess!).

Put about 1 t cranberry-jalapeno relish in the center of each dough
square. Bring 2 corners of the dough-square up and seal well. (Cookie
should be shaped something like this:
