Crepes:  Place eggs, milk and butter in blender; add flour and blend
about 1 minute, until smooth. Refrigerate batter at least 2 hours and
as long as 12 hours before making crepes. To cook crepes, pour 3
tablespoons batter into greased, heated crepe pan or small skillet;
cook until done on one side (it is not necessary to cook crepes on
both sides). To assemble crepes, blend half the Crab Filling with the
Swiss Cheese Sauce; correct seasoning.  Place a large spoonful crab
mixture on each crepe and roll; place seam side down in two buttered
large rectangular glass baking dishes. Spoon remaining crab mixture
over crepes; sprinkle with grated cheese and dot with butter. Bake
uncovered in preheated 400'F. oven 20 minutes, until hot and bubbly.
This dish may be frozen or refrigerated before serving; if chilled,
remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking.

Crab Filling:  Melt butter in skillet; stir in green onions and
crabmeat. Mix lightly and cook a few minutes; add seasonings. Add
vermouth and boil rapidly until liquid is almost evaporated.  Scrape
from skillet into bowl; reserve.

Swiss Cheese Sauce:  Blend cornstarch and milk; reserve. Put vermouth
in same skillet that filling was cooked in; boil rapidly until
vermouth is reduced to 2 tablespoons. Remove from heat; stir in
cornstarch and milk mixture.  Return skillet to low heat and add
cream slowly, along with salt and pepper; cook several minutes until
slightly thickened. Stir in cheese and cook until melted and
well-blended; correct seasoning.

NOTE: This recipe makes enough crepes to fill two baking dishes.
