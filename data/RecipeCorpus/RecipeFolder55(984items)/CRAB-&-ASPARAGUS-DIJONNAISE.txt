vinegar 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 5 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1/2
teaspoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon slat 1 Dash of white pepper 1/2 cup
vegetable oil 1/2 cup Creme Fraiche

Place the egg yolks, vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, sugar, salt and
pepper in a blender. Blend for a few seconds. With the motor still
running, add the oil in a slow steady stream until well incorporated.

Remove the sauce to a bowl and whisk in the Creme Fraiche. Cover and
refrigerate. This can be made several days in advance and kept in the
