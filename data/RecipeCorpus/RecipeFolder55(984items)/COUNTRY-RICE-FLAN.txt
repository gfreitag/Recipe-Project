Pastry:  Sift flour into a large bowl. Using a pastry blender or 2
knives, cut in butter evenly. Lightly mix in sugar and egg to make a
dough. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes.

To Make Filling:  Bring milk to a boil with granulated sugar and
butter in a medium saucepan.  Stir in rice; reduce heat and simmer
gently 1 hour. Stir occasionally until mixture is thick and creamy.
Remove from heat. In a large bowl, beat eggs, cream cheese, c candied
peel, cinnamon and lemon and orange peel. Gradually stir in rice
mixture; cool. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  On a floured surface,
roll out two-thirds of dough to fit an 8-inch flan tin with a
removable bottom. Place dough in tin without stretching.  Pierce
bottom of pastry shell all over with fork; fill with rice mixture.
Roll out remaining dough. Cut into strips and place on top of flan in
a lattice pattern. Bake 50 minutes, covering with foil if becoming
too brown.  Leave in tin until filling is set. Sift powdered sugar
and cinnamon mixture over warm flan. Serve immediately.
