Title: COUSCOUS (2)
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-============
-(4 servings)
Ingredients:

Ground turkey 2-3 medium-small carrots 4-6 cups cooked
double mustard sauce asparagas butter or olive oil
1 lb
couscous 1 cup
cinnamon ground allspice Sorry, but a lot of this is very approximate.

Brown the turkey, drain, add spices to taste and mix, simmer 2-3 min.
For me "to taste" is uasually about 1/8th tsp. allspice, 1/4-1/3 tsp
cinnamon.

Cut the veggies into ~3" pieces, slice the carrots into 1/4s length
wise. Steam the veggies, then saute briefly in olive oil or butter.

Double mustard Sauce:

A standard thick white sauce, with 1/2 the normal amount of milk
replaced the same amount of grey mustard, plus about 1 Tbs. mustard
powder (adjusted to taste, of course.)

Spread couscous (1 to 1 1/2 C) on a plate, dribble mustard sauce in a
think line down the center.  put the ground turkey over that. Veggies
go on either side of the plate, and your ready to eat.
