There is a delicacy and refinement about this dish, which is based on
a classic French recipe. Shallots, tarragon and a little cream, and a
topping of grated cheese, make a wonderful combination with sliced
courgettes.

SautÂ‚ the courgettes in the butter or sunflower margarine until
lightly browned and tender, and season with a little salt and pepper.
Sprinkle on the shallots and tarragon and pour in the cream. Heat
through for 5-6 minutes, then pour into a serving-dish. Sprinkle the
grated cheese over the top and brown quickly under a hot grill. Serve
garnished with a sprig of tarragon.
