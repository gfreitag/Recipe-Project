"This rich pink dessert is similar to sorbet but lighter in texture."
(Untried)

In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup of water to a boil, add the
cranberries, and reduce the heat. Simmer the fruit until it is soft,
about 10 minutes. Put the cranberries through a food mill to remove
the skins, or press through a sieve; keep warm.

Meanwhile, put the remaining 2 tablespoons of cold water in a large
bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over it, and let the gelatin soften for 3
to 5 minutes. Stir in the hot cranberries and the honey and mix well
to melt the gelatin and distribute it evenly throughout the fruit.

Let cool to room temperature and stir in the orange juice. Cover the
bowl and refrigerate until well chilled. (From 4 to 8 hours)

Beat in the milk, pour the mixture into a shallow metal dish, and
freeze it until solid. Break it into chunks, transfer them to the
bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade, and process
until smooth. Alternatively, puree the mixture with a hand-held mixer.

Beat the egg white until it is stiff, fold it into the slush, and
return the mixture to the freezing pan. Freeze the dessert for at
least 30 minutes more. If it has frozen solid, transfer it to the
refrigerator to soften for about 15 minutes. Serve in chilled
goblets. Serves 4 at 170 cals each.
