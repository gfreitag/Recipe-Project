In a large saucepan, bring 2 cups sugar and the water to a boil,
stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the berries and simmer over low
heat for 10 minutes or until berries pop open. Cool. Drain the
berries, reserving the juice and measuring 1 cup of berries for use
in the bread.

Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda. In a
large bowl, combine 2/3 cup sugar, the butter, eggs, walnuts, banana
and berries. Add the flour mixture to the berry mixture, stirring
until blended. Pour the mixture into a greased and lightly floured
9x5x3: loaf pan. Bake in a preheated, 350'F. oven for 1 hour or until
a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

For a topping (optional) combine the cranberry juice, 2 tablespoons
sugar and the Grand Marnier in a small saucepan and stir over low
heat until heated through. Poke a few holes in the baked loaf and
pour on the topping. Cool 10 minutes in the pan. Turn the loaf out on
a rack and cool completely. Wrap in foil and store one day before
slicing. Makes 1 loaf.
