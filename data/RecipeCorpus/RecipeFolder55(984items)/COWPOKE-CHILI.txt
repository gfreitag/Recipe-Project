Fat grams    per serving:
Remove the rind from the bacon and cut rind into 1/2 inch squares.
Cut bacon into small pieces; set aside. Put the rind, beans, onions,
grarlic and Ancho peppers into a large heavy kettle. Add water and
bring to a boil. Lower the flame, cover the kettle and let the beans
cook gently about 1 1/2 hours. Add salt and cook uncovered for 15
minutes. In a separate pan, fry diced bacon until slightly crisp. Add
tomatoes and remaining ingredients to bacon. Cook this mixture over
medium flame for about 10 minutes. Skim off excess fat. Add bacon ant
tomato mixture to beans and continue cooking uncovered, over a low
flame for 1 hour or until beans are very tender. Makes about 3
quarts. They used to say a cowhand would work from sunrise to sunset
"for a dollar a day and a plate of beans." Now, either he liked his
work or the beans were pretty good. And they tasted even better when
the cook built a bean chili by adding bacon, tomatoes and hot
peppers. From "Famous Chili Recipes From Marlboro Country".
