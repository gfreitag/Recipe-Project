Title: CRANBERRY CRUNCHES
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 60 Servings
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
4 tb (1/2 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
2/3 c  Jellied or whole berry
Cranberry sauce
1    Egg white, lightly beaten,
For glazing the tops
"Tart and tangy, these crackers capture the distinctive flavor of
cranberries. Serve them with wine or apple juice as an ideal starter
for a fall picnic. 325~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat oven to 325~F.

Stir together the flours and salt in a large bowl or in the food
processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

Add the cranberry sauce and blend to form a dough that will hold
together in a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions
for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to about
1/8 inch thick.

With a cookie cutter or a small glass, cut the dough into 2-inch
circles. Prick all the way through each circle with a fork in 2 or 3
places. Bake for 10 minutes. Brush the tops with egg white and
continue baking another 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned
and crisp. Cool the crackers on a wire rack. Yield: 50-60.

VARIATIONS: For a crunchier cranberry cracker, add 1/4 cup Grape Nuts
cereal or chopped, toasted walnuts with the flours. If necessary, add
additional cranberry sauce.
