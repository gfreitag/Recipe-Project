Title: CRAZY SAM ON RO*TEL
Categories: Info
Yield: 1 Info

I'm not quite like any cut and dried, country fried chili dipper who
ever bellied up to campfire before. I'm outlandish, audacious, and
can be as temperamental as a rattlesnake with corns.

But I know how to cook.

And I've got articles about me in Bon Appetit and other fancy food
magazines and a wall or two of cooking awards to prove it.

Sure it's taken plenty of experimenting and a few burnt pots and pans
along the way.

It's also taken an ingredient that's been around plenty of
prize-winning kitchens in the Southwest for a long time: RO*TEL
Tomatoes and Green Chilies.

RO*TEL got its start from my part of Texas, down in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley, where the land is fertile and the sun almost never
forgets to shine.

RO*TEL figured out a long time ago just how to take a handful of the
finest tomatoes and green chilies and stir 'em together to add a
double helping of flavor to any meal.

Flavor that'll open your eyes.

Jump-start your heart. (tm)

And make you glad you're hungry.

RO*TEL in this booklet. I guarantee you'll be glad you did.
