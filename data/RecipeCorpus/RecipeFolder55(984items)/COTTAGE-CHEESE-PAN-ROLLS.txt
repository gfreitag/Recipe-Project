Title: COTTAGE CHEESE PAN ROLLS
Categories: Breads, Rolls
Yield: 12 Servings
2 pk Yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
3 c  Smooth cottage cheese
1/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking soda
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Warm water
6 c  Or more flour
Dissolve yeast in warm water till foamy. Heat till warm, the cottage
cheese, sugar, salt, baking soda and 1/2 cup water. Add the yeast
mixture and 1 cup flour and beat smooth with electric mixer.Gradually
stir in by hand more additional flour to knead into a smooth , soft
but elastic dough. Place in an oiled bowl, cover and let rise until
double and light in volume. Punch down and shape into 24 pieces or as
large or small you want them. Roll each piece into a ball shape.
Place balls side by side in greased pan ( pans ) and let rise until
light and double in volume in a warm place.Sprinkle tops of rolls
with flour prior to baking for a bakery look. Bake in a preheated 350
degree oven about 20 minutes or golden. I bring these to parties and
bake in those disposable aluminum pans.

Comment: I use small curd cottage cheese which blends more easily
than the large curd and gives these rolls a wonderful flavor and
texture.
