In a saucepan, heat the cranberries and water to the simmering
point. Simmer for 15 minutes, until the berries have burst and the
liquid takes on a syrup-like consistency. Strain mixture through a
sieve; discard berry skins.

chill overnight.

NOTE:  The reason for the blue food coloring is that without it,
this cranberry sauce is very RED.  If you want it to look more like
the canned stuff (a purplish hue), just add a drop or two of the
blue).
