Title: CRANBERRY WINE MOLD
Categories: Cranberries, Desserts
Yield: 16 Servings
1 pk Fresh cranberries (12 oz)
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Red wine
3/4 c  Water
1 pk Raspberry-flavored gelatin
-(6 oz)
1 c  Chopped nuts
Rinse the cranberries in a strainer and remove any stems. Place the
berries in a large sauce pan. Add the sugar, wine and water to the
sauce pan and stir to blend.

Bring to boiling over medium heat. Lower the heat and cook for 5
minutes, or until the berries burst. Remove the sauce pan from the
heat and stir in the raspberry-flavored gelatin until the gelatin
dissolves.

Place the sauce pan in the freezer and chill, stirring several times,
for 30 minutes, or until the gelatin becomes syrupy.

Fold the chopped walnuts into the gelatin mixture until well-blended.
Pour into an 8-cup mold or deep bowl. Refrigerate for four hours or
overnight.

To unmold, run a thin-blade knife around the edge of the mold. Dip
the mold into a pan of hot water for 30 seconds. Invert the mold onto
the serving plate. Return the gelatin to the refrigerator until
serving time.
