In a small saucepan, sprinkle unflavored gelatin over cold water. Let
stand 1 minute. Stir over low heat until gelatin is completely
dissolved, about 3 minutes. In medium saucepan, combine egg yolks,
sugar and salt. With wire whisk, beat mixture until very thick. In
small saucepan, heat milk just to boiling point; whisk in egg
mixture. Cook egg mixture over low heat, whisking constantly, until
mixture thickens like a light custard. Remove from heat; stir in
gelatin. Transfer mixture to a large bowl; stir in prepared cranberry
compote; chill until mixture mounds, about 1 hour. Whip heavy cream;
reserve 1/2 cup for garnish. Fold remaining cream into cranberry
mixture. If desired, sprinkle cake with brandy, then spread with
preserves.

To assemble, place one cake layer in the bottom of a 3-quart glass
bowl, then spoon on half of the cranberry mixture. Top with remaining
cake layer, then spoon on remaining cranberry mixture. Garnish with
reserved whipping cream.

PUMPKIN CAKE: In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat 1 3/4 cups
all-purpose flour, 1 1/4 cups sugar, 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1
teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/3 cup softened
butter and 2/3 cup milk for 2 minutes. Add 1 egg and an additional
1/3 cup milk; beat 2 minutes. Fold in 1/2 cup pumpkin puree. Pour
into a greased 9-inch round cake pan. Bake in a 375-degree oven for
35 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
