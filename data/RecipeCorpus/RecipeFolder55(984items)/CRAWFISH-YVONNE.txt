Categories: Main, Dishes
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Roux: peanut-butter colored
1 lb Butter
4 md Onions -- chopped fine
3 md Bell peppers -- chopped
Fine
3    Celery ribs -- chopped fine
3 lb Crawfish tails -- peeled
3 oz Crawfish fat
5 c  Water
1 tb Salt
2 ts Cayenne pepper
1 ts White pepper
1 ts Black pepper
5 dr Tabasco sauce -- (5 to 6)
1 c  Green onions -- chopped
1 c  Parsley -- chopped
3 c  Rice -- cooked
In a heavy 6-8 quart pot, melt the butter over high heat. Add the
onions, bell peppers and celery and cook, stirring often, until the
vegetables are very soft, 30-45 minutes. While the vegetables are
cooking, place the crawfish tails in a large bowl and add the water.
Agitate thoroughly with your hands to rinse the crawfish and to
separate any remaining fat from them. Pick out any veins or other
debris. Drain the crawfish, reserving the liquid, and place the tails
in a separate bowl. Lower the heat under the vegetable mixture and
add the roux, salt, peppers and Tabasco sauce. Cook over medium heat,
stirring constantly, until the roux is completely blended in, 3-4
minutes. Stir in the crawfish fat and let the mixture simmer 4-5
minutes more, stirring frequently. If the oil begins to separate out,
just stir it back in until the mixture is smooth. Pour in the
crawfish liquid and bring to a heavy simmer. Cook for 10 minutes,
stirring often to keep the oil from separating. You can prepare ahead
to this point, returning the mixture to a simmer when you are ready
to proceed. Add the crawfish tails and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in
the green onions and parsley and simmer for 1 minute more. Serve over
cooked rice. Festival: New Orleans Wine & Food Experience; June
