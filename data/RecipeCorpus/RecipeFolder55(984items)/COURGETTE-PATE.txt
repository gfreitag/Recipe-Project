Wash and trim the courgettes and cut them into slices about half an
inch thick. Melt half the butter in a pan and cook the courgettes in
it gently for about 10 minutes, until they become just soft but not
pulpy. Put them in a food processor. Put the remaining butter into
the pan, break in the eggs and soft scramble them. Add a couple of
trimmed and chopped spring onions, if liked, and mix them in with the
scrambled eggs. Add the eggs to the courgettes in the food processor
with the majoram and thyme and a genorous seasoning of salt and
pepper - otherwise this can be a very bland dish. Process for a few
seconds, scrape the sides down and process again. The end result is a
beautiful gold and green flecked puree. If you are not using a
processor, mash everything together with a fork really well. Pour the
puree into a souffle dish and chill for two hours until the butter
and eggs have set. This pate remains soft, so you can cut it with a
spoon. but it is also spreadable, deliciously light and delicate.
