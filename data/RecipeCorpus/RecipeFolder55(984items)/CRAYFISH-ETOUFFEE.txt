Categories: Main dish, Fish, Cajun
Yield: 12 Servings
3/4 lb Butter
6 c  Chopped onion
2 c  Chopped green pepper
5    Cloves of garlic
4 ts Salt
1 ts Black pepper
1 ts Cayenne pepper
1 ts Sugar
1/4 c  Tomato paste
3 tb Cornstarch
1 1/2 c  Water
1 1/2 c  White wine
4 lb Crayfish tail meat
1    Scallion, chopped
1 ts Kitchen bouquet
In large heavy pot, melt butter and saute onions, celery, green
pepper and garlic until soft. Stir in salt, black and cayenne pepper,
sugar and tomato paste. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20
minutes. Dissolve cornstarch in water; add wine to mixture. Cook for
20 minutes or until sauce thickens. Add crayfish, green onion and
Kitchen Bouquet. Refrigerate overnight. Reheat and serve over rice.
Don't overcook. Boiling crayfish: Discard any dead crayfish in the
sack. Wash crayfish in clean, cool water just before cooking. They do
not need to be purged with salt during washing.   Place the live
crayfish in boiling water and boil for 10 minutes. (Season the water
with one pound of salt per five gallons of water. Add other seasoning
to taste, including cayenne, garlic, onions, lemons, lemon juice and
crab boil.) Don't begin timing cooking until watter returns to a buil
after adding crayfish. It's usual to add potatoes and corn on the cob
to the boil. Crayfish are easiest to peel when still warm.
