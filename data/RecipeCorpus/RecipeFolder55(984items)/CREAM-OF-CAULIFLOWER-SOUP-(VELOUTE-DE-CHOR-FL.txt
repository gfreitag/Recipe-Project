Title: CREAM OF CAULIFLOWER SOUP (VELOUTE DE CHOR-FL
Categories: Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
1 sm Head cauliflower
Salt
1 lg Leek, white part only
Fresh ground white pepper
2 tb Butter
1/2 c  Creme Fraiche
2 tb Flower
1 c  Croutons
3 1/2 c  Boiling water
Blanch the cauliflower:  break the head into flowerets and put them
in a saucepan with cold water to cover. Bring it to the boiling
point, cook for one minute, drain, and rinse the flowerets under cold
running water.

Wash the leek, slice it into small rounds, and cook them in the butter
until they are soft.  Stir in the flower, cook for a few minutes
until it is golden, and add the boiling water. Add the blanched
cauliflower, season to taste with salt and pepper, and simmer for
20    minutes.

Strain the soup through a food mill or puree it in a blender. Stir in
the creame fraiche, correct the seasoning, and serve with croutons.

CREME FRAICHE: American heavy cream is considerably thinner than
French heavy cream.

Use 1 teaspoon of buttermilk for each cup of heavy cream. Heat in a
saucepan until it is lukewarm (about 85 F), pour into a glass
container, and allow it to stand at room temperature until it
thickens. In very hot weather it can thicken in as little as 6 hours;
in cold weather it can take as long as 36 hours.  This can be stored
in the refrigerator for a least a week.
