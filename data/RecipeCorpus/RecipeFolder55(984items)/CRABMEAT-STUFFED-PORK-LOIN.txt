Over
Preheat oven to 350. In a small bowl, combine the salt, white pepper,
red pepper and thyme; mix well and set aside. Place the pork on a
flat surface and cut a deep 3" long slit in the center to form a
pocket, being careful not to cut all the way through the meat.
Sprinkle the seasoning mix on the outside surface and inside the
pocket; set aside. Spray the inside of a medium skillet with nonstick
vegetable cooking spray (or use some olive oil)and place over high
heat.  Add the onions and bell pepper and saute for 5 minutes,
stirring often. Add the stock and the remaining seasoning mix. Reduce
the heat to simmer; stir in the soy sauce, lemon juice, bread cubes
and crabmeat. Cook for 1 minute, or until the mixture is firm but not
dry. Remove from the heat.  Spoon into the pocket and secure with
toothpicks or tie up with some cotton string. Spray the inside of an
8"square baking dish with nonstick vegetable cooking spray or oil
with some olive oil. Place the pork in the dish and cover with
aluminum foil. Bake for 30 minutes, turning once during cooking.
Uncover and cook for 10 minutes more. Turn the pork over and cook for
10 minutes longer, or until brown. Remove the toothpicks before
serving.
