Title: CRAFTY SPONGE CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Barry
Yield: 6 Servings
5 oz Soft Margarine
5 oz Caster Sugar
3 md Eggs
5 oz Self-Raising Flour
5 fl Double Cream
3 tb Favourite Jam
Preheat the oven to gas mark 4, 350F, 180C, and grease and line two
8-inch sandwich tins. Put all the ingredients, except cream and jam,
into the bowl of your food processor or mixer and blend for 15
seconds. Scrape down the sides, then blend again for another 15
seconds. Don't over-process though.

Spread the mixture into the prepared tins, making sure the tops are
even, and bake for about 25 minutes. Towards the end of the time,
check to see if the cakes are done by pressing your fingertip gently
on the middle of each cake. If the fingermark vanishes, it's cooked,
otherwise leave for another 4 to 5 minutes.

Let the sponges rest for a minute or two, then turn them out onto a
wire rack and leave to cool. Whip the double cream, and when the
cakes are quite cool, spread one half liberally with jam and the
whipped cream and carefully put the othe half on top.
