beat cream cheese until softened. Gradually beat in sugar; beat for 3
minutes or until fluffy. On low speed, beat in eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each addition.  Stir in vanilla, chocolate and
salt; stir in sour cream. Pour onto crust.

come 1 ~ inch up the side.  Bake at 325F for 1 1/4 hours or until the
edge is set but centre still jiggles slightly. Turn oven off; let

Glaze:  In saucepan cook cranberries and 1/4 cup water, partially

cook for 2 minutes or until sugar is dissolved but berries have not
popped. Drain, reserving juice and berries seperately.

Remove cake from pan; place on cake plate.  Return juice to saucepan;
blend in cornstarch.  Cook, whisking, until boiling and thickened;
let cool slightly.  Spoon berries around edge of the cake. Spoon
glaze over top. Refrigerate for 1 hour or until set. Garnish with
chocolate gratings.
