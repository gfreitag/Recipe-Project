Title: COUNTRY HAM PREPARATION
Categories: Pork, Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ea COUNTRY HAM, ANY SIZE
SCRUB OR CUT OFF ANY MOLD THAT IS ON HAM WHEN PURCHASED. THEN
RINSE IT WITH A MIXTURE OF EQUAL PARTS OF WHITE VINEGAR AND WATER.
HANG IN THE HAM IN A COOL PLACE TO STORE IT. IF MOLD REOCCURS. THE
HAM WILL CONTINUE TO AGE WHILE IT IS STORED. THE COOLER THE
TEMPERATURE THE LESS IT WILL AGE.
COUNTRY HAMS ALWAYS TASTE SALTY. YOU CAN REMOVE SOME OF THE SALT
AND ADD MOISTURE BACK TO THE CURED HAM BY SOAKING IT IN WATER FOR 24
HOURS. SALT CONSCIOUS PAOPLE SOMETIMES SOAK THEM UP TO 72 HOURS. IF
YOU DO THIS, CHANGE WATER DAILY. THIS REMOVES SOME OF THE SALTY
TASTE, BUT NOT ALL.
COOK THE HAM ACCORDING TO THE COUNTRY HAM WITH BROWN SUGAR COATING
DIRECTIONS.
ONCE THE HAM IS COOKED IT WILL KEEP IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR UP TO 6
WEEKS IF IT IS TIGHTLY WRAPPED IN BROWN PAPER OR ALUMINUM FOIL. DON'T
USE PLASTIC WRAP AS IT HOLDS TO MUCH MOISTURE AND SPEEDS SPOILAGE.
