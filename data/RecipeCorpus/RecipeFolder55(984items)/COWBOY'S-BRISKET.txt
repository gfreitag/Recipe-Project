With a long thin, sharp knife, make slits in the meat and insert the

and the crushed garlic over the meat, and pour in the vinegar.
Marinate for 6 hours at room temperature or overnight in the
refrigerator, turning several times.  When ready to cook, prehaeat
the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the bacon fat in a deep, heavy
skillet large enough to hold the brisket. Remove the brisket from the
marinade and discard the onion nd vinegar. Dry with paper towels.
Brown the meat well on all sides. Remove brisket to a platter.  In
the fat remaining in the skillet, saute the remaining sliced onions
until deeply browned. Pour in 1/2 cup coffee.
Bring to a boil, stirring and scraping the bottom of the skillet to
loosen the browned bits.  Spread the onions and liquid from the
skillet in a shallow baking dish. Place the brisket on the onions.
Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.  Pour in the
remaining coffee and water. Cover tightly with foil and place in oven
for 1/2 hour. Turn the oven down to 250 degrees F. and bake for an
additional 2 hours or until meat is very tender.  Slice the brisket
thinly against the grain. Skim the fat from the pan liquid. Return
the meat slices to the pan. Serve at once or refrigerate for later
use.
