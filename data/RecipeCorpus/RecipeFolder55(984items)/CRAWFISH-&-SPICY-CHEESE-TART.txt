saute pan melt butter. When it begins to foam add red peppers and
onions, and cook for 2 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring, for 3
minutes. Add crawfish and cook for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat
and fold in cheese and green onions. Season to taste with salt and
cayenne. Mound crawfish mixture in center of pastry circle, leaving a
2- to 3-inch border of pastry. Fold excess pastry up over filling,
layering it over, but not completely covering filling. Work around
circle, continuing to fold over previous fold, until it forms a
rustic, free-form tart. Slide cookie sheet into oven and bake for 35
minutes
