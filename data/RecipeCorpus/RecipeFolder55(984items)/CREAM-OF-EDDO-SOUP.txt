Heat butter in a large, heavy saucepan and gently sweat the eddoes,
onion and celery, covered, until softened but not colored. Add the
stock, fasten bouquet garni to pot and bring to a boil.  Cook,
partially covered, until eddoes are very soft, about 20 minutes.
Remove bouquet garni.

Puree soup mixture in electric blender or food processor until
smooth. Add cream and seasonings; return to a boil. Taste and adjust
seasonings.

Serve in heated bowls garnished with freshly chopped cilantro.

Enright says that the potato-like eddo, with its creamy interior, is
popular in the Caribbean and available most months in Canada.
