Categories: Info
Yield: 1 Info
No ingredients
In some parts of the country, particularly the Southwest, it's almost
un-American to even think of brewing up a dip without adding RO*TEL
Tomatoes and Green Chilies to give your taste buds a healthy shot of
up and attum.

Everybody does it.

And they are all convinced that they have gone and invented an
original, one-of-a-kind dip recipe that has never passed anybody's
lips before. you might as well do it too.
