Title: CRANBERRY FRITTERS
Categories: Desserts, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Cranberry jelly, canned
5 tb Flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Sugar
5 tb Water
Vegetable oil
-- for deep-frying
Flour; for dredging
Cranberry tartness suggests the original Chinese ingredient, a firm,
gelatinous jelly flavored with the hawthorn berry (or 'shan dza',
which in northern China is pureed to make a delicious tart, thick,
cooling drink). Enclosed within a light, deep-fried batter, the
strips of jelly become hot and soft or, in the case of cranberry,
almost liquid. Buy the "jellied cranberry sauce", not the whole-berry
type.

This recipe makes three to four small servings.

DIRECTIONS: =========== Cut the jelly crosswise into three round
slices, 1/2 inch thick. Cut each slice into three strips,
approximately 1/2 x 1/2 x 2-1/2 inches.

Prepare a batter by blending the flour, baking powder, sugar, and
water.

Heat oil for deep-frying; after it is hot, keep the heat around
medium-high.  Dredge the cranberry jelly strips lightly in flour,
making sure all sides, including the ends, are dusted. Then dip them
in the batter to coat completely, and immerse them in the oil until
golden brown. Fry only a few at a time.  Drain on paper toweling, and
eat while hot.
