Categories: Pies
Yield: 8 Servings
2    Eggs
1 c  Granulated sugar
8 oz Sour cream
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1 c  Raisins
1 tb All-purpose flour
Pastry for a 9-inch
Double-crust pie
1 tb Milk
1 ts Granulated sugar
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a medium bowl, beat the eggs.
Beat in the sugar, sour cream, cinnamon, salt and cloves. Stir in the
raisins and flour.  Roll out the bottom crust to fit a 9-inch pie
plate. Ease into the pie plate; trim even with the edge. Pour the
raisin mixture into the pastry-lined plate. Roll out the top crust
and arrange over the filling. Seal and flute the edge.  Brush the top
of the pie with milk; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar. Cut slits so
that steam can escape. Cover the edge of the pie with foil. Bake for
25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 20 to 25 minutes more, or
until the pastry is golden and the filling is bubbly.
