1/2 ts Salt

Place the chickeo, veal knuckle and butter in a large soup kettle.
Lightly brown the outside of the chicken in the butter and the fat
that wiil gather from the chicken and veal knuckle Then add the
carrots, parsley, celery, pepper, onion and cold water. Continue to
cook until it starts to boil. Remove all surplus fat and froth that
may gather on the top. Turn the heat down and continue to simmer for
2 to 3 hours, or until a fork can be twisted in the meat of the
chicken breast.

Remove the chichen and veal bones from the soup. Set them aside to
cool. Strain the soup through a fine sieve and set it aside to cool.
As soon as it is cooled, carefully remove all of the fat from the
surface. Then return the soup to the stove and bring to a simmer
again. Remove all the meat from the chicken bones. Discard all the
skin and vegetable pieces, for you have already extracted all of the
good in them.

Beat the cream, flour and eggs together until all are smoothly
blended. Add the salt to the simmering soup and mix well. Take about
1/2 cup of the hot simmering soup and beat it into the egg and cream
mixture. Then slowly add the egg cream mxture to tbe soup, stirring
all the while. Continue to cook over low heat for a few minutes
longer, until the soup has thickened and lightly coats tbe spoon. At
this point add the Tabasco if you like this sharpness in creamed
soups. Serve piping hot with saltines.

Serves 6 generously.
