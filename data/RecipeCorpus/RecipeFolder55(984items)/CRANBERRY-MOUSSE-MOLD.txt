20 oz Crushed pineapple
6 oz Strawberry gelatin
1 c  Water
1 lb Whole cranberry sauce
3 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 ts Fresh grated lemon peel

Unmold onto serving plate. Garnish with lemon rind twists, mint
springs and some whole raw cranberries. If your mold has an opening
in the center, fill with crushed pineapple.
