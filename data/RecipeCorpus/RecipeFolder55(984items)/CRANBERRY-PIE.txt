Title: CRANBERRY PIE
Categories: Pies, Fruits/nuts, Holiday
Yield: 8 Servings
3    Eggs
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Grated orange zest
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Flour
6 oz Butter; melted
1 c  Fresh cranberries
Here's a filling that should work nicely with cranberries. You may
want to adjust sugar--the filling is tart, but you might like it
sweeter. This recipe is enough for a 10-inch tart, about 1-inch deep.
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Whisk together eggs, sugar, zest and vanilla.
Add the flour until well mixed. Set aside. In a small saucepan, heat
the butter over high heat until foamy and brown. Pour the butter in a
steady stream over the egg mixture, beating to incorporate. Add the
cranberries and pour the mixture into your tart shell. Bake for 45 to
50 minutes. Let cool completely before serving.
