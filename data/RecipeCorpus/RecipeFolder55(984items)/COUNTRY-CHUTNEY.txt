The author writes: "This relish is based on a prize-winning English
recipe of more than a generation ago. It is less sweet than
traditional chutneys; most of its sweetness comes not from sugar, but
from apples, dates, and parsnips.  I generally use Winesap apples but
any well-flavored, crisp eating apple will do."

Cook unpeeled parsnips 30 to 40 minutes in boiling water, to cover,
in a saucepan or skillet wide enough to permit them to lie flat. They
should be soft enough to mash. When the parsnips can be pierced
easily with a fork, drain and cover with cold water until cool enough
to handle. Peel and mash.

Simmer the apple slices with 1/2 cup water  in a covered 1 1/2-quart
saucepan for 12 to 15 minutes, or until soft enough to mash. Do not
drain.

Place the mashed parsnips and apples in a wide 4-quart saucepan. Add
onions and tomatoes; tie ginger and mustard seed loosely in a double
thickness of dampened cheesecloth or place in a metal tea ball and
add to the pan, along with vinegar.  Bring to boil over medium heat
and simmer slowly 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

Add remaining ingredients and simmer 1 hour more, or until thick. Stir
occasionally to prevent sticking. The chutney will darken
considerably. Remove from heat and spoon at once into hot, sterilized
half-pint or pint jars; seal.  Store at least 1 month before opening.

Yield: About 7 cups.
