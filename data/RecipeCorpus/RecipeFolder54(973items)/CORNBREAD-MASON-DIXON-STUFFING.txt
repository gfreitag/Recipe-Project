As a Californian, married into a Southern family, I can warn you that
the traditional cornbread stuffing probably isn't gonna be to his
taste. The first time I had the stuff, I found it gritty, nasty, and
just plain wierd.

Wes, on the other hand, was less than enthralled by the sage-laden
stuff that *I* think ought to go into a bird. Now, we compromise,
with a dressing that we both enjoy.

Crumble the cornbread and white bread into a big bowl.

Melt the butter in a large frying pan, add the onions and celery, and
cook over low heat until the vegetables are soft, but not browned.
Dump the butter/vegetable mixture over the bread.  Stir in the nuts,
canned corn and its liquid (if used), seasonings. Add broth to
moisten to the consistancy you like (Western-style dressing tends to
be a bit dryer than the Southern version).
