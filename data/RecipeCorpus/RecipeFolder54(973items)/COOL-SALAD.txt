Title: COOL SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 1 Recipe
2 1/2 c  Cooked AM 7 Bean & Barley
-- (drained)
1 c  Cubed avocado
1/3 c  Diced cucumber
1/4 c  Diced onion
1/4 c  Diced pimiento
1 tb Snipped fresh chives
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
2 tb Apple cider vinegar
1/4    AM Sesame Oil*
1/2 ts Sea salt (optional)
1/2 ts Onion powder
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Dried basil
1/2 ts Dried oregano
Combine cooled 7 Bean & Barley with remaining ingredients in a large
salad bowl and toss lightly. Serve Cold.

*NOTE: The recipe (as published) seems to be missing the unit of
measure for the AM Sesame Oil.  I would guess that it should be '1/4
cup'. -K.M.
