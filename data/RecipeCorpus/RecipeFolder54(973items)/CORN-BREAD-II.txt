Title: CORN BREAD II
Categories: Breads, Cajun
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Corn meal
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Soda
2 c  Buttermilk
2/3 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
2    Eggs, beaten
Prepare large cast iron skillet:  grease generously with bacon
drippings so that bottom of skillet is well covered. Place skillet in
400 F. oven to heat. Meanwhile prepare batter: Combine dry
ingredients, add eggs and butter milk, mixing well.  Remove skillet
from oven when grease starts to smoke; scrape batter into skillet.
Batter must start to sizzle as soon as it hits skillet.  Place in
oven and continue baking for 20-25 minutes, or until browned on top.
I don't use this skillet for anything but corn bread and I never wash
it, just wipe out well. After a few times you will find the corn
bread will fall out of pan easily and intact. Courtesy Telephone
