Title: COCONUT SHRIMP B1
Categories: Chinese, Fish, Appetizers
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Shrimp, shelled & deveined
8 oz Shredded coconut
1    Egg
3/4 c  Milk
1/4 c  Light brown sugar
-(firmly packed)
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
3 c  Vegetable oil; for frying
Cut each shrimp in half lengthwise.  Place the shredded coconut in a
shallow bowl.  Prepare the batter. In a small bowl, combine the egg,
milk and sugar, beating until well blended. Gradually work in the
flour, beating with a rotary mixer until smooth. Pour 1 inch of oil
into the pan and heat it to 375F. Dip each shrimp half in the egg
mixture, then in the coconut(it should be thoroughly coated), then
fry in hot oil for 5 minutes, or until golden brown.  The shrimp can
be reheated in a 350 F oven for 5 minutes: they should be served hot.
The best shrimp to use for this recipe are mediums, which come 20 to
a pound. The shrimp can be fried in wok, a deep saucepan, or an
electric frying pan.
