FOR PEPPERS:  Lightly oil 9x13-inch baking dish.  Char peppers over
gas flame or in broiler until blackened in several spots on all
sides. Wrap in plastic bag and let stand 20 minutes to steam. Peel
charred skin off peppers.  Rinse peppers under running water.  Cut 1
inch off peppers at stem end.  Remove seeds.  Pat peppers dry with
paper towels. Arrange peppers cut side up in prepared baking dish.

Preheat oven to 325F. Mix ricotta, eggs, Parmesan, garlic and
rosemary in medium bowl.  Season with salt and pepper. Spoon stuffing
into peppers. Bake until filling begins to set and tops are just
crusty, about 35 minutes Cool, then cover and refrigerate at least 4
hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)

FOR DRESSING:  Whisk garlic, vinegar, mustard and tomato paste in
bowl. Gradually whisk in oil. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be
prepared 1 day ahead. Store at room temperature.)

TO SERVE:  Arrange peppers on platter.  Mix basil into dressing and
spoon over peppers.  Garnish with olives and serve.

NOTE:  You can stuff and bake the peppers the day before. Serve them
whole or cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices and fan them on
plates. Try to purchase peppers with flat, even bottoms so they will
stand upright during baking.  Serve as an appetizer to a grilled
chicken or fish dish.
