Drop 1 heaping teaspoon of the preserves into each of 6 well-buttered
1/3 to 1/2 cup muffin tins. In a bowl whisk together the brown sugar,
the oil, and the egg white until the mixture is smooth and whisk in
the milk. In another bowl whisk together the flour, the baking
powder, the cinnamon, the salt , and the coconut, add the milk
mixture, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Divide the
batter among the tins and bake the muffins in the middle of a
preheated 400oF oven for 20 minutes, or until a tester comes out

muffin, and lift each muffin out with a fork, inverting it onto a
rack. Jody Prival Makes 6 muffins.
