Title: COD WITH GARLIC
Categories: Low-fat, Fish, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Fresh cod fillets
1/4 c  Plus (see next line)
1 tb Fresh lime juice
1 ts Olive oil
1 tb Unsalted butter
5 tb Thinly sliced garlic
3 tb Flour
4 tb Coarsley chopped fresh
-cilantro
Salt and pepper
Rinse the fillets and pat dry. Place the fillets in a glass or enamel
coated dish with 2" sides, and sprinkle with the lime juice. Cover
with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. In a large heavy
skillet, combine the oil and butter and heat over medium heat. Add
the garlic and saute only until light brown; be careful not to burn
or the dish will be bitter. Using a slotted spoon, remove the garlic
and set aside; remove the pan from the heat, but hold for cooking the
fish. Remove the fish from the dish, reserving the lime juice, and
pat dry with a paper towel. Dust it lightly with the flour and shake
off the excess. Warm the skillet over medium-high heat and quickly
fry the fish 2-3 minutes per side, or until brown and crisp outside
and just done on the inside. Remove fish to a heated platter and keep
warm while you finish the dish. Return the garlic to the skillet and
reheat. Stir in the reserved lime juice, cilantro, and salt and
pepper to taste. Heat just until the cilantro begins to wilt.Pour the
sauce over the fish and serve immediately.
