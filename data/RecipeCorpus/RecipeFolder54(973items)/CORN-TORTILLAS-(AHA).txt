Title: CORN TORTILLAS (AHA)
Categories: Breads, Mexican, Heartright
Yield: 12 Servings
1 1/2 c  Water
1 1/2 tb Acceptable margarine
1 c  Stone-ground cornmeal
1 1/2 tb Acceptable margarine
1 1/4 c  Whole-wheat flour
1 ts Salt
Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan.  Add 1 1/2 T margarine.
Stir in cornmeal quickly, then immediately lower heat and cover pan.
Let cornmeal cook over very low heat for 5 minutes.  Stir in
remaining margarine and set aside to cool.

Mix flour and salt.  Stir in cooled cornmeal and knead, adding water
or more flour if necessary to form a soft dough.  Pinch off twelve
pices and roll into 2-inch balls.

Flatten each ball between palms or against a board, making a flat
circle. Roll with rolling pin to 6-7 inches.  Keep turning the circle
to keep it round, and sprinkle board and pin with cornmeal as needed
to prevent sticking.

Cook on a hot ungreased griddle for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or
until flecked with dark spots.

Line a basket or bowl with a large cloth.  Stack tortillas in bowl
and keep covered with cloth.

They may be made up to a day in advance.  Heating for a few seconds
on each side makes them soft and pliable for handling again.  Heat
them on a griddle or directly over a medium gas flame.
