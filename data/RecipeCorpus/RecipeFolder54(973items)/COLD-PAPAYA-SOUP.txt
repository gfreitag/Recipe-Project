Title: COLD PAPAYA SOUP
Categories: Soups, Caribbean, Appetizers, Fruits
Yield: 4 Servings
1 ea Ripe papaya, about 6" long
Sugar, to taste
Fresh lime juice, to taste
Peel the papaya & cut in half.  Spoon out the seeds & keep them in a
small container in the refrigerator.

Cut the papaya into chunks & reduce to a liquid puree in the food
processor.  Add the sugar & lime juice. If the puree is too thick,
stir in a little water, but be very careful that you do not add too
much water or you will lose the consistency.

Serve in fruit cups with a dab of the reserved seeds in the centre of
each serving.
