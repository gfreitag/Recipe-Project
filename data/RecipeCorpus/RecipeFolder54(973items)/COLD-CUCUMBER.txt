Title: COLD CUCUMBER
Categories: Chinese, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Cucumber
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb (1 1/4 T) soya sauce
1 tb (1 1/4 T) wine vinegar
1 tb (1 1/4 T) caster
-(superfine) sugar
2 ts Sesame oil
Did some rummaging around in my cookbooks and came up with the
following. This first one sounds like it's on the track of the
cucumber pickles you had at the Chinese place, though these are
diced, not sliced and call for sesame oil rather than seeds.

Peel the cucumber and cut into small dice.  Sprinkle with remaining
ingredients and leave for 5 minutes before serving. Make sure sugar
has dissolved before serving.
