1    roasting chicken -- 5 to 6
pounds

2 TB melted butter -- or

3 1/2 c  chicken stock
1 TB chopped fresh rosemary
Freshly ground black pepper

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Peel the garlic. In a small bowl,
combine the salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of the paprika. Rub the
chicken with the butter or oil and then with the spice mixture. Stuff
the cavity of the bird the garlic cloves, half of the orange peel,
bay leaves, and rosemary sprigs. Truss the legs and place the chicken
in a large bakingdish. The trussed chicken can be refrigerated for 3
or 4 hours, well wrapped. Bring to room temperature before cooking.

Add enough stock to come 1 inch up the side of the chicken. Place in
the oven and bake 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until a meat thermometer
inserted in the thigh registers 180 degrees. Transfer the chicken to
a cutting board and let sit 10 minutes before carving. Add any
remaining stock to the pan and bring to the boil over medium-high
heat, stirring and scrapingthe cooked bits from the bottom of the
pan. Add the remaining orange peel -- chopped rosemary, and 1/2
teaspoon paprika; season to taste with salt and pepper. Continue to
boil until the sauce is reduced by about one-third, about 5 to 10
minutes. Arrange the carved chicken on a serving platter and pass a
bowl of the sauce separately.
