Title: COCONUT TOFU SOUP (VEGAN~ BUT HIGH FAT)
Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 lb Extra-firm tofu
2    Cloves garlic, minced
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 cn Coconut milk (I try to get
Frozen, or make fresh if I
Am ambitious)
1 1/2 c  Vegetable stock (or water)
1 tb Light soy sauce
Keffir Lime leaves - to
Taste, this is a tough one
Since it can come packaged
In a number of ways. I
Typically get dried in which
Case I let 2 to 3 T soak in
Water before using*.
1 oz Galanga (Kah) - Galanga is
Thai ginger
1    To 3 Thai or Serrano Chiles
To taste (I like 4!)
*Very marginal substitutes (although still good!) are to try 1/4 c.
coarsly chopped lemon grass, or the juice from 1 lime. This has to be
experimented with, it is used to reduce the sweetness of the coconut
milk. You do not want this flavor to dominate, though. Add a little
at a time, and taste to get it right.

Drain the tofu of extra water by placing a heavy weight over the tofu
surrounded by 3 layers of paper towels. Cut tofu into bite size
pieces. Stir fry the garlic in the oil until golden (do not burn),
then stir fry the tofu until it is an even golden brown. In a medium
size sauce pan mix the coconut milk, stock (or water) and soy sauce.
Add the tofu, Keffir Lime leaves (or substitute), and Galanga. Cook
over low to medium heat for 15 minutes, do not allow to boil! At this
point, taste the soup. If the coconut taste is too strong add a
little more of the Keffir Lime leaves (or substitute). The idea is to
reduce the sweetness of the coconut milk. With the flat of a heavy
knife (or something similar) pound the chilies until they are split
in several places. Add to the soup, and let cook a couple minutes
more.

Serve over steamed rice (preferably, Jasmine Rice).
