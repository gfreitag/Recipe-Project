Title: CONCHAS (COILED SWEET ROLLS)
Categories: Breads, Mexican
Yield: 12 Servings
3 1/2 c  Flour (More If Necessary)
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 pk Dry Yeast
Butter Or Margarine Softened
2/3 c  Very Warm Water
2    Eggs, Room Temperature
1/2 c  Honey
3/4 c  Chopped Almonds
Mix 3/4 cup flour, sugar, salt and undissolved yeast in large bowl.
Add softened butter. Gradually add water and beat 2 minutes on medium
speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add eggs and 1/2
cup flour. Beat on high speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally.
Stir in enough additional flour to make stiff dough. Turn out onto
lightly floured board and knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 10
minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let
rise in warm place until doubled. Punch dough down. Divide in halves.
On lightly floured board, roll half of dough to 15- x 12-inch
rectangle. Spread with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Fold in half.
Roll out again to 15- x 12-inch rectangle. Spread with 2 tablespoons
more butter. Fold in half and roll out to 18- x 6-inch rectangle. Cut
dough lengthwise into 6 (1-inch) strips. Fold each strip in half
lengthwise so that it is 1/2-inch wide. Gently roll to round and
lengthen each strip to rope 1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter. Hold one end
of each rope firmly and wind dough loosely around to form coil. Tuck
end underneath. Place on greased baking sheets about 2 inches apart.
Repeat with remaining dough. Cover and let rise in warm place until
doubled. Heat honey until thin. Gently brush rolls with half of honey
and sprinkle with almonds. Bake at 400Ã¸F 15 minutes or until browned.
Remove from baking sheets and cool on wire racks. Drizzle while hot
with remaining honey. From:  The Los Angeles Times.
