* (works better than mix to me.) I gladly will share my Alabama
cornbread recipe with you. I put butter on after cooking. I wish I
could be real accurate in the measurements but I mix till it LOOKS
RIGHT. Practice makes the best bread. Pour oil in skillet till size
of pancake(about 4inches diameter) and heat in 450 oven while you mix
other ingredients as listed. Add hot oil(if hot enough it will
sizzle.) AFTER YOU ROLL IT AROUND IN SKILLET TO GREASE WELL. AND mix
gently. Pour into greased skillet. Bake till goldenbrown.  Enjoy,
