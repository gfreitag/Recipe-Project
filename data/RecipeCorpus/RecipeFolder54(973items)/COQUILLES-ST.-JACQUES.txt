Yield: 3 Servings
1 lb Scallops
4 tb Butter
1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms
3 tb Flour
1 c  Dry white wine
2/3 c  Water
2    Parsley sprigs
4    Whole black peppercorns
1 pn Dried thyme
1    Bay leaf
1/2 c  Shallots; or onion
-chopped
1    Egg yolk
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 ts Lemon juice
Cayenne to taste
1/2 c  Dry bread crumbs
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
Butter
1 1/2 c  Potatoes; cooked and

Melt 1 Tb butter in a heavy skillet and saute mushrooms. Remove
mushrooms and set aside. Add remaining 3 Tb butter and the flour and
cook together over medium heat 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly.

Combine the wine, water, parsley, peppercorns, thyme, bay leaf and
onion in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil 10 minutes, strain and
return liquid to the pan; add scallops, cover and let simmer 3
minutes. Remove scallops and set aside. Bay scallops can be served
whole; the larger sea scallops should be sliced into thirds across
the grain. Reduce liquid to 1 cup; add butter-flour mixture and whisk
constantly until the mixture thickens. Stir egg yolk into cream [or
you can use evaporated skim milk for a reduced fat version], add a
little of the hot sauce, stir into yolk mixture then stir back again
into the hot sauce and turn off heat. Stir in lemon juice, cayenne,
mushrooms and scallops. Divide into lightly greased scallop shells (6
servings, if an appetizer) or 3 individual serving casserole dishes
(if entrees). Melt the butter and fry the bread crumbs in a small
skillet. Mix in the grated Parmesan. Sprinkle this mixture over the
scallops. With a pastry tube pipe a line of whipped potatoes around
the edges of the shell/dish.

Place in a 400 degree preheated oven and broil 2 to 4 minutes until
the topping is golden brown.
