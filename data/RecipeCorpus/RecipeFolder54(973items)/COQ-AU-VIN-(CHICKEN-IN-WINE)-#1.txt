*Bouquet garni - place 1/2 celery stalk cut in half, 2 parsley
sprigs, 1 bay leaf, 1 thyme sprig or 1/4 tsp. dried thyme, and 1 leak
or green onion in a cheesecloth tie with a string to make a small bag.

In a 5-quart dutch oven cook bacon on medium heat. Remove bacon bits
with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add butter to pan; then add
chicken pieces and brown lightly on all sides. Add shallots, garlic,
chopped onions, reserved bacon, wine, chicken stock, bouquet garni,
salt (optional), pepper, and boiling onions. Bring to a boil, lower
heat, cover and simmer about 15 minutes.  Add mushrooms and brandy.
Cook until tender about another 30-35 minutes.

To serve, remove chicken, onions, and mushrooms to a heated platter
with slotted spoon.  Remove and discard bouquet garni. Thicken liquid
by mixing 1 tabl. flour with 1 tabl. water. Stir into liquid in pan
and simmer for a few minutes until slightly thickened. Spoon some
sauce over chicken and serve. SOURCE: Personal family recipe.
