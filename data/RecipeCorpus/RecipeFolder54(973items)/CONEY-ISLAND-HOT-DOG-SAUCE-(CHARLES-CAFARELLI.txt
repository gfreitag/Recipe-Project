Categories: Pets, Sandwiches, Sauces
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Butter
1 tb Margarine
1 1/2 lb LEAN ground beef
2 md Onions minced
1    Clove garlic minced
3 tb Chile powder
1 tb Prepared mustard
1    6oz can tomato paste
1    6oz can water
13/16    Cheap skinless hot dogs

Do NOT brown beef before using!! Combine all except hot dogs and
simmer until thick. Grind the hot dogs [or chop in food processor]
stir in and cook 15 min longer.

Store in frig or freeze some.

Use over GOOD casing type hot dogs with chopped onions and mustard.
The big secret in this recipe is the ground cheap hot dogs.

This is the orignal Flint [Mi] Coney Island sauce. Best around
anywhere.
