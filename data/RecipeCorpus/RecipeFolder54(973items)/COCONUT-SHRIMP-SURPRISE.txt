* Pop frozen shrimp directly into the sauce, still frozen, and simmer

depending on the size of the shrimp.

Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks
and saute until softened, 8-10 min, stirring. Add the tomatoes and
their juice, orange juice concentrate, lemon juice, dried mint (fresh
mint is added later), chile paste, salt and pepper. Cook the sauce,
uncovered, until slightly thickened, about 10 min, stirring
occasionally. Stir in the coconut milk with the fresh mint and heat
for 2 min. Add the shrimp, cover and cook until they just turn
opaque, 2-4 min; the shrimp will continue to cook on standing, so
avoid overcooking. Spoon the rice into individual bowls and ladle the
shrimp and sauce on top.
