Title: CORNBREAD (PRODIGY)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  White flour
1 c  Corn flour or fine cornmeal
2 tb Sugar
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
2    Eggs
1 c  Milk
2 tb Melted butter
This batter can also be baked in muffin cups as well as in a loaf pan.
Either way, it's good.

PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Combine the white flour, corn flour or cornmeal,
sugar, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs;
then stir in the milk and the butter. Pour the wet ingredients into
the dry ones and stir just enough to combine, in about 15-or-16
strokes. Overmixing causes the cornbread to be tough. Pour into a
buttered baking pan and bake until the cornbread is firm and a
toothpick comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
