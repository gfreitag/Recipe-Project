Title: COOLING JARS
Categories: Canning, Information
Yield: 1 Guide  When you remove hot jars from a canner, do not retighten their jar
lids. Retightening of hot lids may cut through the gasket and cause
seal failures. Cool the jars at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours.
Jars may be cooled on racks or towels to minimize heat damage to
counters (Plate 1). The food level and liquid volume of raw-packed
jars will be noticeably lower after cooling. Air is exhausted during
processing and food shrinks. If a jar loses excessive liquid during
processing, do not open it to add more liquid. Check for sealed lids.
For more information see "Testing Jars Seals".
