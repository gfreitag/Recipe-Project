Title: COFFEE-WALNUT TOFFEE
Categories: Candies
Yield: 2 Servings
1 1/4 c  Unsalted butter
1 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Packed golden brown sugar
1/3 c  Water
1 tb Dark unsulfered molasses
2 ts Instant espresso powder
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
2 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts
-- (toasted)
4 1/2 oz Bittersweet chocolate
--(imported), finely chopped
Butter small cookie sheet.  Melt butter in heavy 2-1/2 quart saucepan
over low heat.  Add both sugars, water, molasses, espresso, cinnamon
and salt; stir until sugar dissolves. Attach clip-on candy
thermometer to pan. Increase heat to medium; cook until thermometer
registers 290 degrees F, stirring slowly but constantly and scraping
bottom of pan with wooden spatula, about 20 minutes.

Remove pan from heat.  Mix in 1-1/2 cups nuts. Immediately pour
mixture onto prepared sheet; do not scrape pan. Tilt sheet so that
toffee spreads to 1/4-inch thickness. Sprinkle chocolate by generous
tablespoons atop toffee, alternating bittersweet and white
chocolates. Let stand 1 minute. Using back of spoon, swirl chocolates
to spread slightly. Shake sheet to form even chocolate layer.  Using
tip of knife, swirl chocolates to create marble pattern. Sprinkle
with remaining 1/2 cup nuts. Refrigerate until toffee is firm, about
1 hour.  Break toffee into pieces. (Can be made 2 weeks ahead.  Chill
in airtight container.) Serve cold or at room temperature.
