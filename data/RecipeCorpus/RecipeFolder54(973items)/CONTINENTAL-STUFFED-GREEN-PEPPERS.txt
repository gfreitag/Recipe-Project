While these were not on the menu every day, they did put them out
once in a while.  This may be a little jazzed up but is one of the
best that I have tried.

In a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat, heat the vegetable oil and
add the garlic and onion cooking for about 10 minutes, stirring
frequently, until tender. Add the tomatoes and liquid, tomato puree,
wine, sugar, basil, oregano and thyme and bring to a boil. Reduce the
heat to low and simmer the sauce, covered, 20 minutes. Meanwhile,
prepare the rice according to the directions on the package and set
aside, covered to keep warm. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.  In a
medium-size skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef, stirring,
until well browned. Remove from the heat and drain off the excess
fat. Stir in the rice, 1/2 cup of the sauce and season with salt and
pepper to taste. Spoon the mixture into the pepper halves and place
the peppers, filling side down, in a 13 X 9 X2-inch baking pan. Pour
the remaining sauce over the peppers and cover with foil. Bake for 35
to 40 minutes.
