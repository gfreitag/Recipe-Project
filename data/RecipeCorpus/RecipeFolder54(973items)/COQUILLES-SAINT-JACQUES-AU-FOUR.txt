Wash and drain 2 pounds of scallops and arrange them in scallop
shells or ramekins.  If sea scallops are used, cut each into 4
pieces. Season the scallops with salt and pepper, cover them with
finely chopped mushrooms and parsley, and sprinkle them with bread
crumbs. Dot each shell with butter and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon dry
white wine. Put the shells on a baking sheet and bake them in a hot
oven (400F) for 10 to 12 minutes. Squeeze a few drops of lemon juice
over each shell and garnish with parsley sprigs.
