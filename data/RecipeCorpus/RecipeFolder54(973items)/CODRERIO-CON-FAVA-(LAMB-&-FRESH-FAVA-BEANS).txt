Categories: Try it, Pileggi, Lamb
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM------------------SEPHARDIC COOKING; MARK-----------------------
~Jewish, Turkish
2 c  Water
3 lb Lamb shank or breast of ~lamb, cut into 3" pieces
2 c  Water
3 lb Fresh fava beans
1 ts Salt, or to taste
2 ts Sugar
4    Scallions, sliced into 1/2" ~pieces

1.  Cook the lamb in 2 cups of water over moderate heat for 5 minutes,
stirring several times.  Drain well to remove excess fat.

2.  Add the 2 remaining cups of water to the pan, cover, and cook
over low heat for 1 hour.  This should tenderize the lamb.

3.  Trim the fava bean pods on both ends.  Cut the pods into 3 equal
pieces. Add them to the lamb with the salt, sugar, and scallions.
Cover the pan and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes, or until the
favas are tender. Adjust the salt.

The preparation of this Passover dish exemplifies the Turkish
preference for the natural taste of ingredients. Only the simplest of
seasoning are used here to allow the flavor of the favas to dominate.
