Title: COOKIE DOUGH (LACTO)
Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------MIX WELL-------------------------------
1 c  White Wave soy yogurt
1 c  Applesauce (unsweetened)
2    To 3 c. turbinado sugar
2 ts Vanilla
1 c  Rolled oats (whole)
2 c  Rolled oats (process in food
Processor to coarse flour)
MMMMM-----------------------SIFT TOGETHER----------------------------
1 c  Unbleached flour
1 1/2 tb Baking powder
1 1/2 tb Baking soda
1 ts Salt
2 tb Ener-g egg replacer
Combine mixtures.  The baking soda should react somewhat, making the
mass fluffy and easy to stir. Add more flour until a cookie dough
texture is reached (I had to use ~ 2.75 c. total).

Add chips or fruit or whatever.  Shape into balls and bake at 375
until browned.  They do brown, they don't melt around the edges in
that weird way that bad cookies do, and were considered entirely
successful.

Source: Inspired by the sudden appearance of Obie's cookies in my
HFS, but finding them way too sweet, I made my own reduced-fat
cookies last night.
