4    Coriander seeds
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
3 c  Vodka

Add all ingredients together and steep for 3-4 weeks. Turn jar every
few days. The coconut tends to be porous and absorbs the alcohol so
be sure to thoroughly strain and filter the mixture to yield the
largest amount. Natural coconut may also be used, but tends to be
watery and requires more coconut. Yield: 3 cups Container: Wide mouth
