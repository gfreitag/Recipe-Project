yolk, almond extract and vanilla in a small bowl until frothy; add to
flour mixture. Beat unti thoroughly combined and mixture is
moistened. (Take a little bit of the cookie mixture between your
fingertips and pinch; if the dough holds together you have beaten it
enough). Add almonds and hazelnuts. WIth your hands, work nuts into
dough until mixture begins to hold together. Turn out onto a piece of

serrated knife using a sawing motion. Place cookies on large
