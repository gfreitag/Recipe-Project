1 c  Milk
2 tb Instant coffee granules
2 1/2 c  Flour

Measure milk and stir in instant coffee. Put flour, baking powder and
salt into a large bowl; stir to mix well. Add butter and cut in with
a pastry blender or rub in with your fingers until the mixture looks
like fine granules. Add sugar and hazelnuts; toss to distribute

wooden spoon until a soft dough forms. Scoop 1/4 cup portions of
dough and place about 2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake at 425 for about 15 minutes or until the dough colors, but does
not get dark brown. Put scones on a dish towel on a wire rack. Cover
loosely with cloth and cool 1-2 hours before serving.
