4    3-to4-oz pork tenderloin
-cutlets
1    Beaten egg

2 tb Cornmeal
1 ts Paprika

Place each tenderloin cutlet between 2 pieces of clear plastic wrap.
Using the smooth side of a meat mallet or the bottom of a small
frying pan, pound meat to 1/8-inch thickness. Remove plastic wrap and
place on baking sheet. Freeze meat for about 10 minutes or till it's
stiff.

In bowl, combine egg and milk.  In another bowl, combine flour,
cornmeal, paprika and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Dip each tenderloin into egg
mixture, then into flour mixture, pressing the flour into the meat.
Repeat dipping in egg, then flour mixture.

In a large skillet, heat 1/2 inch of shortening or cooking oil till it
sizzles when a pinch of cornmeal is added. Fry tenderloins, 1 or 2 at
a time, for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side, turning once. Keep warm
in oven while you fry the remaining tenderloins. Serve warm on buns.
Pass the condiments.  Makes 4 servings.
