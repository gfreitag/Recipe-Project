Categories: Candy
Yield: 22 Servings
6 oz Semisweet chocolate pieces
4 oz Milk chocolate pieces
(or white, mint, etc.
-chocolate)
20    Plastic spoons
Place a piece of waxed paper on a cookie sheet large enough to hold
20 to 24 of your plastic spoons. Place semisweet chocolate pieces in
a heavy saucpan over low heat, stirring constantly until the
chocolate begins to melt. Immediately remove from heat; stir until
smooth. Dip spoons into chocolate, tapping the handle of the spoon
against the side of the pan to remove excess chocolate. Place spoons
on waxed paper; refrigerate for 30 minutes or until chocolate is set.

Place milk chocolate (or chocolate of your choice) in a heavy saucpan
over low heat, stirring constantly untilchocolate begins to melt.
Immediately remove from heat; stir until smooth. Place the melted
chocolate in a small, heavy self sealing bag. Using scissors, make a
small cut in the corner of the bag; drizzle on or both sides of the
covered spoons, making a decorative pattern. (Small dots, zig-zag
lines, circles, etc.)

The above 2 steps can be reversed if you like! Get 6 ozs. of white
chocolate to cover the spoons and 4 ozs. of chocolate of your choice
to use to decorate the spoons.

Refrigerate spoons for 30 minutes to allow chocolate to set. Wrap each
spoon separately in clear or colored plastic wrap. Use ribbon to tie
off plastic wrap. Store in a cool dry place for 2 to 3 weeks until
ready to give as gifts.

Place chocolate covered spoons in a new coffee mug and give along with
homemade muffins, scones, biscuits, cookies, etc. Posted to MC-Recipe
