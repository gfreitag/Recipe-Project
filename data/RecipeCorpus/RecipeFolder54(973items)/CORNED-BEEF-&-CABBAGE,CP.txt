Title: CORNED BEEF & CABBAGE/CP
Categories: Crockpot
Yield: 1 Servings
3    (to 4 lb). beef brisket
Water
1/2 c  Chopped onion
2    Garlic cloves -- minced
2    Bay leaves
1    Head cabbage
(cut into wedges)
Place corned beef in slow-cooking (Crockpot) pot. Barely cover with
water. Add onion, garlic and bay leaves. Cover, and cook on Low for
10 to 12 hours.
If cabbage is desired, lift cooked corned beef out of pot, turn
control to High, and drop wedges of cabbage into corned beef broth.
Cover, and cook 20 to 30 minutes, or until cabbage is done. NOTE:
from past experience, the cabbage will need more time than that.
You'd be better off to put the broth into a pot on the stove and boil
the cabbage a LOT quicker. From Crockery Cookery Cookbook 6-8
