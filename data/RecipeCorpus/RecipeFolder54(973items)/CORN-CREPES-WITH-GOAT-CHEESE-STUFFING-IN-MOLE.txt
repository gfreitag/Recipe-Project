Title: CORN CREPES WITH GOAT CHEESE STUFFING IN MOLE
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 8 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 lb Goat cheese, fresh, white
3    Eggs
1 2/3 c  Corn kernels, fresh
1 2/3 c  Nopalitos; diced/cooked *
1/2 c  Golden raisins
1/2 c  Pine nuts; lightly toasted
2 tb Green chilis; diced
Salt to taste
Melted butter
MMMMM------------------------TO ASSEMBLE-----------------------------
18    Corn crepes
1 qt Mole Poblano Sauce; approx
MMMMM-------------------------GARNISHES------------------------------
Sour cream
Cilantro sprigs
* if nopalitos can't be found, use diced small zucchini, lightly
sauteed in a little butter and a drop of lemon juice

Soften the goat cheese with a fork. Lightly beat the eggs and stir
them thoroughly into the cheese.

Scald the corn kernels for about a minute, then drain them completely.

Stir together the cheese mixture, the corn kernels, and all the
remaining ingredients except the melted butter. Taste, and add salt
only if it is really needed.

To assemble and serve the crepes: Lightly butter a large baking
sheet. Take one pliable crepe at a time and mound 2 rounded
tablespoons of filling down the center of it, leaving plenty of room
all around. Roll the crepe over the filling, folding in the sides
envelope-style as you finish rolling it up. Fill and fold all the
crepes this way. Arrange the crepes, seam side down, close together
on the prepared baking sheet. Brush their tops lightly with melted
butter. Bake the crepes for about 25 minutes at 350 degrees--they
will be slightly puffed and golden brown.

Meanwhile, heat the mole to a simmer. Spoon about 1/2 cup of mole
onto each plate, place one or two of the hot stuffed crepes on top of
the mole, and garnish with a little dollop of sour cream and a few
cilantro sprigs. Serve at once.

Serve 8-10 as a main course, 18-20 as little dish in a series of
courses.
