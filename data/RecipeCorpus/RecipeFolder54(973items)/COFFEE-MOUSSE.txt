Title: COFFEE MOUSSE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 2 Servings
2    Egg yolks
25 g  Icing sugar
2 tb Very strong black coffee
100 g  White chocolate, grated
150 ml Double cream
This unusual coffee mousse is made with white chocolate, very finely
grated, which gives it a grainy texture. A rich dessert, best eaten
after a light salad meal.

Beat the egg yolks with the sugar, until light and creamy, then add
the coffee. Stir in the grated white chocolate. Beat the cream until
thick and fold into the mixture. Spoon into two glass dishes and
chill for at least 4 hours.
