Title: CORN STICKS
Categories: Breads, Southern
Yield: 10 Servings
2    Eggs
2 c  Buttermilk
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Soda
2 c  Sifted white corn meal
3 tb Melted shortening
1 ts Salt
3 ts Baking powder
Beat eggs together until light.  Add milk, shortening and salt.  Add
meal, being careful in putting in, as meal varies and the batter
should be a medium batter.  Beat smooth.  Grease and heat stick pans.
Sift in the baking powder and dissolve the soda in a spoonful of cold
water. Add to the mixture, stir well and pour into molds.  Bake in
good hot oven until brown and crusty--about 15 to 20 minutes.  Corn
sticks need a batter some thinner than muffins.
