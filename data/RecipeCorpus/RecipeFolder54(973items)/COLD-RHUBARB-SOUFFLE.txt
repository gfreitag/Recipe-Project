Title: COLD RHUBARB SOUFFLE
Categories: Eggs
Yield: 6 Servings
4 c  Chopped rhubarb
2 1/4 c  Sugar
1    Envelope gelatin
1 c  Heavy cream
4    Egg whites
1 ts Vanilla
12    Fresh strawberries
Additional whipped cream
1.  Cook the rhubarb with 1/4 cup water and 1 3/4 cup sugar in a heavy
bottomed saucepan for about 10 minutes until soft. Strain and cook
down the juice to 1/2 cup.  Puree the rhubarb in a food mill or a
blender, or put through a vegetable mill. 2. Soften the gelatin
in 2 tablespoons cold water, then add to the hot
rhubarb juice and stir until completely dissolved. Add the puree.
3. Beat the cream until stiff. 4. Beat the egg whites until they
begin to stiffen, then add the
remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the vanilla, continuing to beat until
stiff peaks form. 5. Fold first the eggwhite mixture into the
rhubarb, then the whipped
cream.  Make a collar of wax paper and fit it around a 1 1/2 quart
souffle mold.  Chill for at least six hours. Remove the collar and
decorate the top with fresh strawberries and rosettes of whipped
cream piped from a pastry tube. ~--
