out onto a floured board. Knead dough 7 to 8 minutes until smooth and
satiny. Place dough in a large bowl dusted with flour. Cover and let
rise for 90 minutes or until doubled in size. After dough has risen,
punch down and stretch into a 16 inch circle. Place dough in a flat
16 inch pizza pan. Cover and let rise for 45 minutes.
To make the sauce; Combine all saice ingredients in a 2 quart
saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes,
stirring frequently. Strain out cloves. Let sauce cool to room
temperature. Sauce can be made up to two days in advance and stored
in the refrigerator.
To assemble the pizza; Heat oven to 500 deg f. Spread 2/3 cup sauce
over the dough. Mix the cheeses and sprinkle them over the sauce.
Bake pizza in oven for 10 minutes or until cheese is bubbly. Remove
from oven and spread barbequed meat over the cheese. Warm the
remaining sauce and spread over the meat. This recipe was Elvis
