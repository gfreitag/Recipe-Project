Title: CORNBREAD-SAUSAGE STUFFING WITH APPLES
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 12 Servings
12 tb Butter
2 1/2 c  Onion; yellow
3    Apples; cored
1 lb Sausage; bulk breakfast
3 c  Cornbread; homemade
3 c  Bread, whole-wheat
3 c  Bread, French
2 ts Thyme, dried
1 ts Sage, dried
-salt and pepper
1/2 c  Parsley,Italian; chopped
1 1/2 c  Pecan halves
Prepare ingredients: Core apples and cut into chunks. Do not peel.
Jonathan and Winesap are good choices. Breads should be coarsely
crumbled. 1. Melt half the butter in a skillet. Add chopped yellow
onions and cook over medium heat, partially covered, until tender and
lightly colored, about 25 minutes. Transfer onions and butter to a
large mixing bowl. 2. Melt remaining butter in same skillet. Add
apple chunks and cook over high heat until lightly colored but not
mushy. Transfer apples and butter to the mixing bowl. 3. Crumble the
sausage into the skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring, until
lightly browned. With a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to the mixing
bowl and reserve the rendered fat. 4. Add remaining ingredients to
the ingredients in the mixing bowl and combine gently. Cool
completely before stuffing the bird; refrigerate if not used
promptly. 5. if you do not wish to actually stuff the bird (goose or
duck, for example, can make the stuffing greasy), spoon it into a
casserole. Cover casserole and set into a large pan. Pour got water
around the casserole to come halfway up the sides. Bake for 30 to 45
minutes at 325Ã¸F., basting occasionally with the cooking juices from
the bird or with the reserved sausage fat if necessary.
Enough stuffing for a 20-pound turkey, to make 12 to
14    portions.
