2 c  Manchego cheese grated
1/2 c  toasted pine nuts

Make the Cornmeal Crepes and the Poblano Chile Cream. Preheat the
oven to 350 degrees. In an ovenproof baking dish large enough to hold
4 crepes, side by side without touching, place the first 4 crepes.
Top each crepe with 1/4 cup of the cooked lobster. Top the lobster
with 1/4 cup of the grated cheese. Sprinkle the cheese with 1
teaspoon of the pine nuts and 1 teaspoon of the cilantro. Repeat
layering 4 crepes, 1/4 cup lobster, 1/4 cup cheese, 1 teaspoon pine
nuts, and 1 teaspoon cilantro and finally top with the last 4 crepes.
You should have 4 stacks. Pour the Poblano Chile Cream over all the
stacks. Bake for about 15 minutes. Transfer each stack to a plate,
and serve immediately, garnished with lime. Yield: 4 servings
