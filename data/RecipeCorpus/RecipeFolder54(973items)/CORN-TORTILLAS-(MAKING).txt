Title: CORN TORTILLAS (MAKING)
Categories: Breads, World
Yield: 16 Servings
MMMMM----------------------FOR 16 TORTILLAS---------------------------
1 1/2 c  Masa harina
1/2 c  Cornmeal
1 1/2 tb Oil
1 1/3 c  Warm water
Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl and beat with a
wooden spoon until thick and smooth. Scrape the sides of the bowl,
and cover the surface of the dough with plastic wrap while pressing
and frying individual tortillas so the dough will not dry out. To
form the tortillas, wet your hands and pull off a lump of dough about
the size of a golfball. Roll it into a ball. Tear off 2 pieces of
plastic wrap about a foot long. Either in a tortilla press, or
between 2 dinner plates, place the ball between the sheets of plastic
wrap. Press down with the palm of your hand to flatten slightly, then
press firmly to form a thin circle. Use the first tortilla to test
the consistency of the dough. If the edges of the tortilla are uneven
and crumbly, the dough needs a little more water. If the sheet of
plastic sticks to the dough and it is very soft, add a few
tablespoons of masa harina. Repeat with the remaining dough, leaving
individual tortillas between the sheets of plastic wrap. Heat a heavy
skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Peel off the top sheet of
plastic and invert the tortilla into the hot pan. Grill until
stiffened, about 30 seconds; turn for 1 minute or less, until the
side is slightly browned, then turn to the first side for 30 seconds.
The time for grilling each tortilla is less than 2 minutes. Repeat
with the remaining tortillas. Source: SouthWest Tastes
