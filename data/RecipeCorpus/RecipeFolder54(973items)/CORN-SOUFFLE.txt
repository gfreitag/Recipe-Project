Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Butter a 1-quart souffle dish or
casserole.  Heat the margarine in a 2-quart saucepan over low heat
until melted.  Stir in the flour, sugar, cumin, nutmeg, and red
pepper. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is
smooth and bubbly. Stir in the milk, heat to boiling, stirring
constantly. Boil and stir for 1 minute.  Beat the egg yolks slightly
in a medium bowl. Stir at least half of the hot mixture gradually
into the egg yolks. Stir the hot mixture back into the saucepan. Boil
and stir for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the onion,
chiles, and corn. Beat the egg whites in another medium bowl on high
speed, on an electric mixer, until stiff. Stir about 1/4 of the egg
whites into the corn mixture.  Fold the corn mixture into the
remaining egg whites.  Carefully pour the mixture into the souffle
dish. Bake uncovered until a knife inserted in the center comes out
clean, about 50 minutes.  Prepare the Green Chile Cheese Sauce. Serve
the souffle with the sauce when souffle is done.
