Wash under running water to remove surface brine.

Cover with boiling water and simmer, allowing about 1 hour per pound,
or until a fork can penetrate to center. Always slice corned beef
very thin, diagonally across the grain.  A classic accompaniment of
corned beef served hot is:

Cabbage wedges simmered with the beef the last 15 minutes of cooking.
Serve hot with: Horseradish Sauce Boiled Potatoes Gnocchi with Farina
Serve corned beef cold with: Horseradish

To press for slicing, cool the meat and force it into a deep pan;
cover and refrigerate weighted.  The moisture pressed from the meat
should form a jellied coating.

After cooking corned beef as in 1, above, you may coat it with the
following glaze and bake in a preheated 350F oven for 15 minutes or
until the topping is set.

Combine and mix well: 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 tablespoon water 1
tablespoon soy sauce 2 teaspoons paprika 1/2 teaspoon ginger

Tenderized corned beef can now be bought for oven roasting; follow
manufacturer's directions.
