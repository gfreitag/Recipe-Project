Title: COCONUT MILK
Categories: Indian
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg Coconut, grated
2 c  To 2 1/2 cups boiling water
Coconut Milk is Santen in Malaysia and Indonesia. Coconut Milk is
Narial Ka Doodth in India. Best made from Fresh Coconuts. Grate the
flesh of one Coconut into a bowl, pour on 2-2 1/2 c Boiling Water,
then leave to stand 30 min. Squeeze

The flesh and strain before using. This makes thick Coconut Milk, for
a thinner milk reuse the pulp and mix the result with the thick milk,
or use by itself for an even thinner Coconut Milk. I use an old
T-shirt to squeeze the Coconut flesh and strain in one operation.

Made from Dried Coconut Put 1 Cup unsweetened Dried Coconut into a
blender. Pour in about 1 1/4 Cups boiling water and blend on high
speed for a couple of minutes. Let cool for about fifteen minutes
then squeeze the pulp and strain. Makes about 1 Cup milk. To make a
thinner milk reuse the pulp.
