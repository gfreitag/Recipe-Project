1 c  Finely packed dark brown
Sugar
1 c  Light corn syrup
1 tb Butter or margarine,
Plus extra for cookie sheet
1 ts Cider or white vinegar
1 1/2 c  Grated coconut
Stir together the brown sugar, corn syrup, butter and vinegar in a 2
quart saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a
wooden spoon, until the sugar dissolves. Cover tightly and cook about

prepared cookie sheet and let cool completely. Break into pieces and
store in an airtight container. Makes about 1 pound or 24 servings.
