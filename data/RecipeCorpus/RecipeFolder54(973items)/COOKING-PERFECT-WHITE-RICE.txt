One of the chief obstacles of most beginning wok cooks is knowing how
to make good edible rice. There isn't any real secret to it. A recipe
developed for beginners is included. All one has to do is follow the
recipe instructions EXACTLY. But first, some facts on rice will be
discussed.

CHINESE RICE: There are many species of rice, about 1,000 of them.
Approximately 50 of these types are cultivated in China. The
properties of each of these varies as to growth, resistance to
disease, adaptation to climate, soil conditions, etc. These factors
all contribute to the quality of the harvested rice.

Most Chinese and other Orientals can readily distinguish the quality
of rice by its texture and taste after it is cooked. There are three
main grain types of rice, long, medium or oval, and short. The
Chinese people generally use long grain rice while the Japanese
people favour oval grain rice. Short grain rice is generally cooked
by both peoples for special pastries or festive dishes.

Both long and oval grain rice are cooked in identical manners. The
only difference is in knowing how much water is to be used in cooking
the rice. This knowledge can only be obtained through experience and
personal preference.
