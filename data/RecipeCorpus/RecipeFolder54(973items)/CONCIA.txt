Leah Bergen of the new Cafe Fontebella in Oakland says Concia
originated in the Jewish ghetto in Rome. She learned to make it from
her grandmother and mother, and has since adapted it to the
restaurants where she has cooked. For garlic lovers, this dish is
heaven.

Slice the eggplant (or zucchini) 3/8 inch thick. Brush with 3 to 4
tablespoons of the olive oil. Grill until golden, about 10 minutes of
the eggplant, 6 to 8 minutes for the zucchini.

Arrange a layer of vegetables in a clean glass jar or dish with a lid.
Sprinkle with some of the salt, pepper, shaved garlic and herbs.
Continue until all the vegetables are used. Combine remaining olive
oil and vinegar pour over the vegetables. Refrig- erate. Turn every
day for 1 week.

Makes 1 quart.
