Recipe by: Southern Living Preparation Time: 0:30 Sort and wash
grapes; remove stems, and place in a Dutch oven. Crush grapes, and
add water. Bring mixture to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer 10
minutes. Press mixture through a jellybag or cheesecloth, extracting
4 cups juice. Cover and let sit overnight in a cool place. Strain
juice through a double thickness of damp cheesecloth.

Combine juice and sugar in a large Dutch oven, and stir well. Place
over high heat; cook, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a
rapid boil. Add pectin, and bring to a full rolling boil; boil 1
minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat, and skim off foam with
a metal spoon. Quickly pour hot mixture into hot sterilized jars,
leaving 1/4-inch headspace; wipe jar rims.  Cover at once with metal
lids, and screw on bands. Process in boiling-water bath 5 minutes.
Yield: 8 half pints.
