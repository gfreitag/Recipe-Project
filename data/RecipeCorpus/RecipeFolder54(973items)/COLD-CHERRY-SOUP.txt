*Fresh cherries are a lot of work but really do taste better than the
canned variety.  **Other cherry flavored liqueur can be used such as
Cherry Brandy but Cherry Heering works the best.

Bring water, sugar, cinnamon stick and cherries to a boil. Simmmer 30
minutes if using fresh cherries, 10 if using canned. Mix together
cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water, stir into cherries and cook and
stir until clear and slightly thickened.  Remove about 1 cup of
cherries and some juice; puree in blender and return to rest of soup.
Cool, add wine and cream, blend well and chill thoroughly. Just
before serving add Cherry Heering or other type of cherry liqueur.
Serve in chilled bowls garnished with mint and dollops of sour cream.
