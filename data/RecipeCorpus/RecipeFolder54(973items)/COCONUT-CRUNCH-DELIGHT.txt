Title: COCONUT CRUNCH DELIGHT
Categories: Christmas, Desserts
Yield: 12 -16
1/2 c  Butter; melted
1 c  Flour
1 1/16 c  Coconut
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Almonds; slivered
1    Vanilla pudding mix
-(instant) (3.4 oz pkg)
1    Coconut pudding mix
-(instant)  (3.4 oz pkg)
2 2/3 c  Milk; cold
2 c  Whipped topping
Note:  If coconut pudding is not available, use another package of
instant vanilla pudding and a few drops (to taste) of coconut extract.

In a bowl, combine first five ingredients:  press lightly into
greased 13x9 pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes, stirring
every 10 minutes to make coarse crumbs. Cool. Divide crumb mixture in
half, pressing half back into the same baking dish to form crust. In
a mixing bowl, beat puddings and milk. Fold in whipped topping and
spoon over crust. Top with remaining crumb mixture. Cover and
refrigerate over night. (I prefer to serve it immediatley while the
crumb mixture is still very crisp)
