Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 2 Servings
1/3 c  Wild Rice
1 c  Water
1    Bacon Strip; Thick, Lean
1 ts Butter; Unsalted
Salt
White Pepper; Freshly Ground
Put the wild rice and water in a small sauce pan.
Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a bare simmer,
cover and cook until the rice is tender, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. While the
rice is cooking, saute the bacon until golden brown and crisp, then
drain on a paper towel.  Cut the bacon crosswise into thin julienne
strips and set aside.  When the rice is done, gently stir in the
butter with a fork until melted; season to taste with salt and
pepper. Just before serving, toss the rice with the bacon strips.
