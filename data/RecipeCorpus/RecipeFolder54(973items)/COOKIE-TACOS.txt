To prepare cookie Taco mould.  Drape greased foil over 1 1/2 inch
wide box on its side (Macaroni and cheese box for example), a rolling
pin or several 10 oz soup cans turned on their sides. In a food
processor, combine eggs, sugar and flour.  Whirl until fairly smooth.
With machine running, add butter through feed tube, then vanilla.
Lightly grease large baking sheet or several small pans such as foil
pie plates.  For each taco, pour about 3 tbsp on to sheet.  Using
back of spoon, spread into 5 inch circles, leaving tow inches between
tacos. Bake in 300 F oven until golden brown and edges are brown.
About 15 minutes.  Using a wide spatula, immediately lift cookies
onto foil draped moulds, flaring out edges. Let cool. Store cookies
in an airtight container.  To prepare the filling, thickly slice
berries. Slice into julienne pieces or small wedges. Place in a large
bowl, stir in sugar, adding more to taste.  Stir lime peel or lemon
filling with cream. Place taco cookie on dessert plate. Spoon about
1/4 cup cream mixture into centre of each.  Top with berries so they
flow out onto the plate.
