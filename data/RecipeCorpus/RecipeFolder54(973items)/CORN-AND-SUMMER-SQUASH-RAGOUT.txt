Slowly bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let steep while
you cut the vegetables.

THE VEGETABLES: Heat the oil in a wide skillet and add the onion.
Saute briskly for a minute or so; add zucchini, corn, remaining
jalapeno from above and season with salt. Continue to saute over
fairly high heat for about 5 minutes. The zucchini and onion may

directly into the pan through a strainer. Add the tomato and simmer
for several minutes. Simmer until the sauce has reduced and thickened
a little and the zucchini is done. Season to taste with salt and
serve garnished with chopped cilantro.
