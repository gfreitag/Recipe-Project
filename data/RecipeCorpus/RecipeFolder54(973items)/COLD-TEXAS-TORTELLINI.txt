Title: COLD TEXAS TORTELLINI
Categories: Italian, Pasta, Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Tortellini (I used cheese)
1 c  Olive oil
3/4 c  White wine vinegar
1/2 ts Pepper
2    Garlic cloves; minced
1 ts Chili powder
1 ts Dry mustard
1 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Cumin
1 ts Salt
1 ds Tabasco (to taste)
1 c  Diced green peppers
3/4 c  Diced red onions*
2 1/2 c  Chopped tomatoes**
1 c  Minced parsley
6 tb Picante or barbecue sauce
1 c  Grated Cheddar cheese
Shredded lettuce (opt'l.)
*Original recipe called for 1 c. red onions but I thought the taste
was too strong.

**Original recipe called for 2 c. tomatoes.

Add tortellini to a large pot of rapidly boiling salted water. Boil
for about 25 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Drain.

Mix all above ingredients, except Cheddar cheese and lettuce. Add
tortellini; toss well.  Chill; marinate 2 to 4 hours. Sprinkle with
Cheddar cheese.  Serve on bed of shredded lettuce (opt'l. - I just
served as is).

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

First had this at Dabo's in 1986 in Pensacola, FL. Valerie Sloane,
one of the co-owners, gave the recipe to me.  Tried at home on
