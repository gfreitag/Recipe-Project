In all my years of eating and cooking Chinese food, I'd never tried
Congee (rice gruel) before yesterday. It just seemed so *bland* that
I thought it couldn't possibly be all that interesting. I was WRONG!
The recipe below gives a subtle but hearty "soup" which can be
garnished in a virtually infinite number of ways according to
personal taste. I found that I like just the basic stuff,
unembellished the best. I substituted half a cup of long grain rice
and half a cup of glutinous rice for the long grain rice and it
worked very well. The preserved turnip seems to be used mostly for
its salt content. I found it unnecessary to add any more salt to the
congee. The tangerine peel gives a very subtle, nice hint of exotic
perfume to the dish. The pot I made set up almost like a pea soup
when it cooled. Good stuff! Ridiculously easy too...

Congee (Jook)

Combine rice, stock, preserved turnip, ginger and tangerine peel in a
large soup pot and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer, uncovered
approximately 1-1 1/2 hours or until the rice is thoroughly broken
up. Stir occasionally to prevent soup from sticking and add boiling
water if necessary. When done, soup should be thick and creamy. Add
salt to taste and garnish with any or all of the suggested garnishes.

Variations: Just before serving, add cooked chicken, pork, ham or
beef. Or with rice add diced forest mushrooms, soaked to soften or
dried shrimp.
