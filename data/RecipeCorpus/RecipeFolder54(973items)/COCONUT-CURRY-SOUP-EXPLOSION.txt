cooking oil and set aside.

In a 3-quart saucepan, combine the coconut milk, broth, lemongrass,
galangal or ginger, fish sauce, curry powder, lime peel and juice, and
chilies or chili sauce. Set aside.

Cut the chicken into very thin bite-size pieces, then mix with the
sesame oil.  Thinly slice the mushrooms and set aside.

LAST-MINUTE COOKING: Bring the soup to a simmer and cook over low
heat for 20 minutes.  Add the chicken and stir gently with a spoon to
separate the pieces. Then add the mushrooms, noodles and salt. Turn
into a soup tureen or individual bowls and garnish with cilantro
sprigs. Serve at once.

Serves: 4 as an entree, or 6 to 8 as the soup course.
