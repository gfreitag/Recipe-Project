In a mixing bowl whisk together all ingredients except oil and
garnishes. Heat a griddle or nonstick pan and brush with about 1
teaspoon oil. Spoon tablespoonfuls of batter onto griddle and cook
until they form a golden crust, turning once. Remove and keep warm
while you use up remaining batter. Serve 3 cakes per person with a
spoonful of chive cream and a dollop of caviar. Sprinkle with choice
of suggested traditional garnishes.
