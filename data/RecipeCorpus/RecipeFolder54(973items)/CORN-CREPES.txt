Title: CORN CREPES
Categories: Pancakes
Yield: 18 Crepes
3 lg Eggs
1 1/2 c  Milk
3/4 c  Water
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Flour
1/2 c  Masa harina (corn flour)
3 tb Butter; melted (plus more)
Beat the eggs, milk, water and salt together, then beat in the white
flour, the masa harina, and the melted butter. Or combine all the
ingredients in a blender and blend until perfectly smooth, stopping
to scrape down the sides as needed. Let the batter rest for at least
an hour.

Heat a crepe pan and brush it with butter, then pour in just enogh
batter to cover the bottom of the pan by quickly tilting it around--a
scant 1/4 cup. Cook for a minute or two on medium heat, until the
crepe is golden brown on the bottom, then gently peel it up and flip
it over. Cook the other side until golden and spotted with brown,
usually less than a minute. Continue this way until all the batter is
used.

Stack the crepes and keep them covered with a slightly damp kitchen
towel as you work. The crepes can be made several hours or a day
ahead and kept in the refrigerator, tightly covered with plastic
wrap. If you refrigerate crepes, allow them to return to room
temperature before filling or rolling them. If handling crepes that
are still cold, heat a non-stick pan and place each crepe in it for a
few seconds to warm it up before filling it; this softens the crepe
and keeps it from cracking.

Makes about 18 to 20 crepes.
