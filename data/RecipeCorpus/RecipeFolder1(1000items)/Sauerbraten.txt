Place meat in a large container (NOT Metal).  In a saucepan bring water,
vinegar, onions, salt, peppercorns, bay leaves, and cloves to a boil.
Simmer for 10 minutes.  Cool marinade to room temperature.  Pour marinade
over meat.  Refrigerate for 2 to 3 days, turning several times each day.
Remove meat from marinade, and dry.  Brown meat in hot vegetable oil in a
Dutch oven.  Add the tomato and marinade liquid.  Cover and simmer gently
1 to 2 hours, until meat is tender.  Remove meat from juices.  Also remove
peppercorns, cloves, and bay leaves.  Mix flour and sugar with water until
lumps disappear.  Add to pan juices and cook until thickened.  Serve with
boiled potatoes and red cabbage.
