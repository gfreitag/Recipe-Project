Title: Italian Sausage in Tomato Sauce
Categories: Cajun, Appetizers, Sausages, Italian, Sauces
Yield: 10 servings
1 ts Oregano
1 c  Chablis wine
1 lb Mushrooms, fresh and sliced
2 lb Italian Sausage
2 tb Olive oil
2 c  Tomato sauce
Saute Italian sausage for a few minutes in olive oil - just long
enough to seal it or firm it up.  Remove sausage and let cool.
Cut into bite-size pieces.  Mix the rest of the ingredients in
the skillet.  Bring to a boil.  Add sausage and cook for 1 hour
on low heat.
Serve as a hot appetizer.
You may wish to be cautious with the wine at first.  Some may
find 1 cup too much.
