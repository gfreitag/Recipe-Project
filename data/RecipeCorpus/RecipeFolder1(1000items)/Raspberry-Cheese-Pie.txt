Categories: Cheese/eggs, Fruits, Pies
Yield: 6 servings
20 oz Frozen Raspberries; Thawed
1 x  Water
3 tb Cornstarch
1/2 c  Whipping Cream; Whipped
8 oz Cream Cheese; Softened, 1 Pk
1/2 c  Dairy Sour Cream
1/3 c  Sugar
2 ea Eggs; Lg
1 ea Unbaked 9-inch Pie Shell
Combine the cream cheese and sour cream in a bowl, using an electric mixer
set at medium speed, until smooth and fluffy.  Add the sugar and eggs
blending well.  Pour into the unbaked pie shell.  Bake at 375 degrees F.
for 35 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Chill for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator.  Meanwhile, drain the
raspberries, reserving the juice.  Add enough water to the juice to make
3/4 cup of juice.  Blend the cornstarch and juice together in a 2-quart
saucepan.  Cook, over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture
comes to a boil.  Cook for 1 minute more.  (Mixture will be very thick.)
Remove from the heat and stir in the raspberries, then cool to room
temperature.  Fold the whipped cream into the cooled raspberries and
spread the mixture over the chilled cream cheese layer.  Chill for an
additional 2 to 3 hours before serving.
