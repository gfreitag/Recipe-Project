Heat the oil in a large pot over a medium-high flame.   When hot, put in
the  peppercorns,  cloves,  bay leaves,  and cardamom pods.   Stir for a
second.  Now put in the onions,  garlic and ginger.   Stir and fry until
the onions develop brown specks.  Now add the meat, ground cumin, ground
coriander,  cayenne pepper,  and 1q/2 of the salt.   Stir and fry for  a
minute.   Add  1 tablespoon of the yogurt.   Stir and fry for a  minute.
Keep doing this until all yogurt has been incorporated.  The meat should
also  have a slightly browned look.   Add the spinach and the  remaining
salt.   Stir to mix.   Keep stirring and cooking until the spinach wilts
completely.   Cover  tightly and simmer on low heat for about 1 hour  or
until meat is tender.
Remove the lid and add the garam masala.  Turn the heat to medium.  Stir
and  cook  another  5  minutes until most of the water  in  the  spinach
disappears and you have a thick,  green sauce.   Remove the whole spices
and serve.
