Title: Snails Sommeroise / Escargots a la Sommeroise
Categories: Appetizers, Pork/ham, French
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 lb Fatty bacon
6 ea Shelled walnuts, ground
4 ea Canned anchovy fillets
3 ea Garlic cloves
1 x  Salt and pepper
3 tb Flour
6 1/2 lb Whole trimmed spinach leaves
100 ea Snails
1 x  Vinegar
2 ea Thyme sprigs
1/2 ea Bay leaf
1 ea Basil sprig
1 ea Pared orange peel
7 oz Pork rind
1/2 c  Olive oil
Preparation time 3 hours.  Cooking time 2 1/2 hours.
Starve the snails for at least 8 days, then wash them in several
changes of water until clean.  Rinse with vinegar, then drain.
Place the snails in a saucepan of boiling water with the thyme, bay
leaf, basil, orange peel and pork rind.  When the snails are almost
cooked, drain them and remove them from their shells.  [I guess
boiling them makes it easier to remove them from their shells.  --mkm]
Brown the snails in olive oil with the fatty bacon, very finely
chopped [I assume the author means chop the bacon first.  --mkm], the
ground walnuts, anchovy fillets, crushed garlic and salt and pepper.
Thicken the mixture with the flour, then serve on a bed of spinach.
[Make sure you wash all the grit off the spinach first.  --mkm]
Rose, red or white wines:  Tavel, Chusclan, Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence.
