Yield: 6 servings
-------------------------------SEASONING MIX-------------------------------
1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves
1/4 ts Rubbed sage
1/4 ts Ground cayenne pepper
1/8 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts White pepper
1/2 ts Ground ginger
------------------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS------------------------------
6 c  Basic chicken stock
1 c  Pan drippings from chicken
8 ea Gingersnap cookies
1 ts Light brown sugar, to taste
1 ts Ground ginger, to taste
2 tb Chicken, pork, or beef fat
2 tb Unsalted butter
3/4 c  Finely chopped onions
1/2 c  Finely chopped celery
1/2 ts Minced garlic
Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. Melt
the fat and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. When almost
melted, add the onions, celery, and garlic; saute 5 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Stir in the seasoning mix and cook 5 minutes more, stirring
occasionally. Add the stock and pan drippings; bring to a boil over high
heat and boil rapidly until liquid reduces to about 1 quart, about 25
minutes. Then crumble the gingersnaps into the stock mixture and whisk
with a metal whisk until they are dissolved. Continue cooking 10 minutes,
whisking frequently and making sure the gingersnaps are thoroughly
dissolved. During this time, taste the gravy; if the ginger flavour is not
pronounced,m add the 1 tablespoon brown sugar and the 1 teaspoon ginger or
add both to taste. Strain the gravy.
Makes 2-1/2 to 3 cups.
