*    Cut the meat into 1/2-inch thick slices.
Pound the meat with a spiked meat mallet to tenderize.  Cut each slice
crosswise into 3 pieces.  Place in a large bowl.  Cover with water and add
the salt and vinegar.  Marinate for 2 hours.  Combine the flour and pepper
in a plastic bag and add the meat, (do not pat dry) 1 piece at a time,
shaking to coat thoroughly.  Heat the oil in the deep fryer or deep large
skillet, over medium heat, to 350 degrees.  Add the meat in batches (do
not crowd) and fry until light brown, about 30 seconds per side.  Drain
the meat on paper towels and place it on a heated platter that has been
tented with foil.
For the gravy, pour off all but 2 Tbls of the oil in the skillet, leaving
the browned bits.  Heat over medium heat and add the flour, stirring and
scraping up all of the browned bits for 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat
and gradually whisk in the milk.  Stir in the salt and continue to whisk
until thickened, about 1 minute.  Serve over the steaks and garnish with
parsley just before serving.
