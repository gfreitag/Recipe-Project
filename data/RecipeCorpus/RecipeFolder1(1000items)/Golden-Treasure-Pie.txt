Combine the undrained pineapple, 1/2 cup of sugar, cornstarch and water in
a small saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the
mixture comes to a boil.  Cook for 1 minute more.  Remove from the heat
and cool to room temperature.  Combine the 2/3 cup of sugar and butter in
a bowl, beating, using an electric mixer set on medium speed, until well
blended.  Add the flour, cottage cheese, vanilla, and salt, beating until
smooth.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Blend in the milk.  Pour the pineapple mixture into the unbaked pie shell
and then gradually pour the cottage cheese mixture over the pineapple
layer, being careful not to disturb the first layer.  Bake at 450 degrees
F. for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 325 Degrees F. and bake
for 45 minutes more, or until a knife inserted halfway between the center
and edge comes out clean.  Cool on a wire rack and serve at room
temperature.
