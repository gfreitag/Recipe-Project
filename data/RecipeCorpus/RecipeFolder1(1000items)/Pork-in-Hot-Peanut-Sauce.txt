Soak radish in warm water for 45 minutes.  Cut pork into 1/2"
cubes.  Drain & rinse canned bean curd; cut into 1/2" cubes.  (If using
fresh bean curd, wrap it in clean dish towel and press it for 1 hour to
make it more firm.  Wrap it tightly & use about a 5-pound weight.)  Drain
radish & cut into 1/2" cubes.  Cut green onions, including tops, into 2"
lengths.
Sauce:  In a cup, cream together peanut butter and soy sauce.  Slowly mix
in remaining sauce ingredients.  Set aside.
Stir-frying:  Add oil to hot wok.  When oil starts to smoke, add pork.
Stir-fry for about 1 minute.  Add garlic & ginger; stir-fry for another 30
seconds.  Transfer pork to saucepan; add peanut sauce; heat & simmer for 15
minutes, adding onions about mid-way.  Skim off excess oil.  Add more stock
if sauce thickens.
Steaming:  In Chinese steamer, steam radish & bean curd on its serving
plate for 15 minutes, just prior to serving.  When ready to serve, drain
water off plate, and top vegetables with pork & peanut sauce.
