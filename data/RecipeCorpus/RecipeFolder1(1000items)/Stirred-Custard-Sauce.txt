Cool the custard mixture for Stirred Custard Sauce by placing the glass
measure inside a larger bowl filled with ice water.  After stirring the
mixture, stir in the Galliano, brandy or Ameretto and the vanilla.  Adding
these ingredients at this stage speeds the cooling of the custard and
helps prevent curdling.  Be sure to place clear plastic wrap directly on
the surface of the custard before it is refrigerated.  Covering the
surface will prevent a "skin" from forming on the top of the Custard
Sauce.
