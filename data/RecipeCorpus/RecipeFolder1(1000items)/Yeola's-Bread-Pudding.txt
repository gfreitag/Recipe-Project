From Justin Wilson's "Outdoor Cooking with Inside Help"
I've had this with a delicious Jack Daniels sauce.  I've looked
high and low, but can't find the recipe.  If you're ever in
Lafayette Louisiana go to Prejeans, one of the nicest Cajun
restaurants around.  They serve a great bread pudding there,
maybe you can talk them into giving you their sauce recipe.
