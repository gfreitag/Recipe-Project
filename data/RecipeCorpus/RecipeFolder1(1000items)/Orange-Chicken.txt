~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Halve chicken breast lengthwise.  Place one portion, boned side up,
between two pieces of clear plastic wrap.  Working from the center to the
edges, pound lightly with a meat mallet, forming a rectangle about
1/8-inch thick.  Remove plastic wrap.  Sprinkle chicken with salt to
taste.  Repeat with the remaining portion of chicken.  In a small bowl
stir together cooked rice, shredded orang peel, and ground cinnamon.
Spoon half of the rice orange peel mixture atop one chicken breast
portion, spreading it to within 1/4-inch of the edges.  Fold in sides,
roll up jelly-roll style, starting with one end.  Repeat with the
remaining rice-orange peel mixture and chicken portion.  Place chicken
rolls, seam side down, in a shallow baking dish.  Cover with vented clear
plastic wrap.  Micro-cook the chicken rolls, covered, on 50% power for 7
to 8 minutes or till chicken is tender, rotating dish a half-turn after 4
minutes.  Transfer chicken rolls to a serving platter.  For orange sauce,
in a 1-cup measure stir together orange juice and cornstarch.  Micro-cook,
uncovered, on 100% power for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or till mixture is
thickened and bubbly, stirring every 20 seconds.  Stir in broken walnut
meats.  Spoon the orange sauce atop the chicken rolls on the serving
platter.  Garnish with cucumber roses, if desired.
