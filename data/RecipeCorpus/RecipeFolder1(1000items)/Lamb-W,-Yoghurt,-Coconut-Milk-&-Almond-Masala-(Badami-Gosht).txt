Categories: Ethnic, Lamb
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  chopped onions
3 ea cloves garlic chopped
2 ts chopped fresh ginger
1/2 ts grnd red chili pepper
2 c  coconut milk
3/4 c  boiling water
1/2 c  cold water
1 ts saffron threads
2 c  unflavored yoghurt
2 ts caraway seeds
2 ts salt
1/4 c  ghee (or melted butter)
4 ea 1 in stick of cinnamon
1/2 ts cardamom seeds
6 ea whole cloves
1/2 c  unsalted almonds
2 lb  cubed lamb
Drop  the  saffron  threads into a small bowl or cup,  add  1/3  of  the
boiling  water and soak for at least 10 minutes.   Pour the saffron  and
its  soaking liquid into a deep bowl and stir in  the  yoghurt,  caraway
seeds  and salt.   Add the lamb and turn it about with a spoon until all
the pieces are evenly coated.  Marinate the lamb at room temperature for
about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile,  combine  the almonds and the rest of the boiling water in  a
bowl, and soak for 10 minutes.  Pour the almonds and their soaking water
into a blender and blend until you have a smooth paste.   Set aside.  In
a  heavy casserole,  heat the ghee over moderate heat until fairly  hot.
Add the cinnamon,  cardamom,  and cloves,  stir for a minute or so, then
add the onions, garlic and ginger.  Lifting and turning them constantly,
fry for 7 to 8 minutes until the onions are soft and golden brown.
With a slotted spoon, remove the lamb from the marinade, add the meat to
the casserole, and stir over moderate heat until it browns evenly.  Stir
in  the marinade and the cold water,  then add the almond puree and  red
pepper  and  cook for 10 minutes stirring  occasionally.   Pour  in  the
coconut  mild,  bring  to a boil,  and simmer partially covered  for  20
minutes, or until the lamb is tender.
To serve,  discard the cinnamon and cloves,  mound the lamb attractively
on a deep heated platter, and pour the sauce over it.
