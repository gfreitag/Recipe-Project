EGG THREADS:
In a small skillet, heat a little margarine. When it begins to bubble,
add 1 egg beaten with a little cold water. Tilt the pan so the yolk
mixture coats it in a thin layer, the thinner the better. When the egg is
lightly cooked, turn it out onto a cutting board. Slice it into very thin
strips with a sharp knife. (makes about 1/3 cup)
