Alex Patout says, "Smothering is a multipurpose Cajun technique
that works wonders with everything from game to snap beans.  It's
similar to what the rest of the world knows as braising--the
ingredients are briefly browned or sauteed, then cooked with a
little liquid over a low heat for a long time."
Season the roast with one half of the salt and peppers.  Dust with
flour on all sides.  Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or other large
heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the steak, and brown well
on all sides.  Remove the meat and pour off all but 1 teaspoon
of the oil.  Add half the onions, bell peppers, celery, and the
other half of the seasonings, and the stock or water.  Stir well
and reduce the heat to the lowest possible point.  Return the
roast to the pot and cover with the remaining vegetables.  Cover
and let cook until the meat is very tender, about 1 hour and 15
minutes.
Serve the meat in slices, with rice alongside and the gravy over
all.
When you try this recipe with other kinds of meat, be sure to
adjust the cooking times accordingly--let tenderness be your guide.
For extra flavorful roasts, try larding with slivers of garlic
before smothering.
Serves 4-6
