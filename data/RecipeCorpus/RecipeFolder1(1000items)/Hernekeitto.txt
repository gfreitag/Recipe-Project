This Finnish pea soup can be made well in advance. You can double or
triple the recipe and freeze it in useful quantities. Malla Karhusaari
also suggests reducing the cooking time by using a pressure cooker or
microwave to prepare it.
Rinse peas and soak in cold water in large port for 8 hours or overnight.
Bring peas and soaking water to the boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for
one hour or until peas begin to soften.
Add pork and continue to simmer for two to three hours, until peas and
meat ar thoroughly cooked. When meat is tender, remove it from pot,
discard skin and bone, cut meat in cubes and return to soup. You may need
to add more water to pot for desired consistency.
Season with marjoram, mustard, salt and pepper. Heat to blend flavors and
serve hot.
Serves 6.
