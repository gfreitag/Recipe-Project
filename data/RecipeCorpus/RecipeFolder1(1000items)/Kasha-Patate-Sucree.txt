Title: Kasha-Patate Sucree
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Milk
1/2 c  Tamari
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
1 1/3 c  Buckwheat groats
2 c  Water
2 lb Sweet potatoes
1 tb Butter (optional)
2 ea Medium Onions, thin sliced
This dish has three parts: kasha pilaf, sweet-potato puree and garlic
sauce. Le Commensal has remained popular with Montrealers since opening
at 2115 St. Denis in 1977.
Kasha
Thoroughly rinse the groats and discard water. In a medium saucepan, bring
required water to a boil. Add rinsed groats. Cover. Reduce heat to low and
cook groats for 10 minutes or until the water is absorbed and the groats
are fluffy.
Sweet-Potato Puree
Cut sweet potatoes in halves and bake at 400 degrees for 50 minutes, or
cut in chunks and boil for 30 - 40 minutes, or microwave chunks for about
7 minutes. Remove skins and discard. If using the onions, melt the butter
in a medium skillet, and add onions. Cook over medium-high heat until the
onions are translucent -- about 4 minutes. Set aside. In a large mixing
bowl, mash sweet potatoes. Add sauteed onions, milk, salt and pepper.
Garlic Sauce
In a small bowl, blend tamari with vegetable oil and garlic. Combine the
three parts of the recipe: spoon kasha into a serving dish; drizzle with
garlic sauce. Top with sweet potato mixture. Serve hot. Serves 6.
