With a sharp knife, cut a pocket in the veal breast or leg.  Fill with
stuffing; close opening with toothpicks.  (Tie with string if necessary.)
Rub outside with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in a Dutch oven.  Place meat
in the pan and bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven about 1 1/2 hours.
Bast occasionally with beef broth.  When done, place meat on a preheated
platter.  Pour rest of beef broth into the Dutch oven and scrape brown
particles from the bottom.  Bring pan drippings to a simmer.  Thoroughly
blend cornstarch with sour cream and add to pan drippings while stirring
cook and stir until thick and bubbly.  Slice veal breast and serve sauce
separately.
