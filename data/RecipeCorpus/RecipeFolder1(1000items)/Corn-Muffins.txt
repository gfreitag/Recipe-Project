Categories: Muffins
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea Large Beaten Egg Yolk
2 tb Milk
2 ts Cooking Oil
1 x  Yellow Corn Meal
3 tb Unbleached Flour
3 tb Yellow Cornmeal
1 tb Sugar
3/4 ts Baking Powder

In a small bowl stir together flour, 3 T yellow cornmeal, sugar, baking
powder and salt.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.  Stir
together beaten egg yolk, milk and cooking oil.  Add all at once to the
dry ingredients, stirring just till moistened.  Line two 6-ounce custard

may appear moist but a wooden pick inserted near the center should come
out clean.)
