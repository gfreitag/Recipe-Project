Categories: Vegetables, Soups/stews
Yield: 9 servings
4 c  Hot milk
1/2 ts To 1 t dill weed (to taste)
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts White pepper
2 tb Tamari soy sauce
1 1/2 lb Fresh asparagus
1 1/2 c  Chopped onion

Break off and discard tough asparagus bottoms.  Break off tips; set
aside.  Coarsely chop stalks; cook in skillet with onion in butter,
salting lightly.  After 8 to 10 minutes, when onions are clear, sprinkle
with flour.  Continue to stir over lowest possible heat 5 to 8 minutes.
Slowly add water or stock, stirring constantly.  Cook 8 to 10 minutes
stirring frequently, until thickened.  Cool slightly.  In blender, puree
sauce bit-by-bit with milk until thoroughly smooth.  Return puree to
3-quart pan- preferably a double boiler.  Add dill, salt, pepper and
tamari.  Heat gently but don't boil.  As it heats, cook asparagus tips in
boiling water until tender, but still very green, about 2 minutes; drain.
Add whole to soup.
