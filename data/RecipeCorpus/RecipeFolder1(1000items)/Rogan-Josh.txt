Title: Rogan Josh
Categories: Beef, Lamb, India
Yield: 6 servings
2 ea medium onions
1 ts ground coriander
2 ts ground black cumin
4 ts red paprika
1/2 ts cayenne pepper
1 1/4 ts salt
6 tb plain yogurt
1/4 ts garam masala
1 x  black pepper
2 ea 1" cubes of ginger chopped
8 ea cloves of garlic
1 1/2 c  beef broth
10 tb vegetable oil
2 lb lamb or beef stew meat
10 ea whole black cardamoms
2 ea bay leaves
6 ea whole cloves
10 ea whole peppercorns
1 ea 1" stick cinnamon
Put the ginger,  garlic, and 4 tablespoons water in blender.  Blend well
until you have a smooth paste.
Heat  the  oil in a wok to medium high heat.   Brown the meat  cubes  in
several  batches  and set to one side.   Put the cardamom,  bay  leaves,
cloves,  peppercorns, and cinnamon into the same hot oil.  Stir once and
wait  until the cloves swell and the bay leaves begin to take on  color.
Now  put in the onions.   Stir and fry for about 5 minutes or until  the
onions  turn a medium brown color.  Put in the ginger garlic  paste  and
stir for 30 seconds.   Add the fried meat cubes and juices.  Stir for 30
seconds.   Now put in 1/6 of the yoghurt.   Stir and fry for 30
seconds  or  until  the  yoghurt is well  blended.   Add  the  remaining
yoghurt,  a  tablespoon at a time,  in the same way.   Stir and fry  for
another 3-4 minutes.
Now add the rest of the broth (a little more for beef than lamb).  Bring
the contents of the pot to a boil, scraping in all browned spices on the
sides  and bottom of the pot.   Cover,  turn heat to low and simmer  for
about an hour if lamb and two if beef.  Every 10 minutes or so, give the
meat a good stir.   When the meat is tender,  take off the lid, turn the
heat  up to medium and boil away some of the liquid.   You should end up
with a tender meat in a thick,  reddish brown sauce.   All the fat  that
collects  in  the pot may be spooned off the top.   Sprinkle  the  garam
masala and black pepper over the meat before you serve and mix them in.
