DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
*** My notes: I used red wine vinegar and marinated the meat in the
refrigerator for a little over 24 hours. I added a little red wine
when making the gravy.
Rub the meat thoroughly with the salt and pepper and put in an earthen
dish. Add the onion, bay leaves and peppercorns. Take equal parts of
vinegar and water and pour over the meat. Let stand in this liquid for
24 hours. Put meat in a roasting pan and sear well in oven at 400-F.
When well browned, add a little of the spiced vinegar. Cover pan
tightly and cook slowly for 3-1/2 hours or until meat is tender. Add
more of the vinegar if necessary. When cooked, remove meat to a
platter and thicken liquid with 1 Tbsp flour.
