...Learn all the secrets of really GREAT candy making! *The first thing
that should be done each day, before you start, is to TEST YOUR
THERMOMETER! To do: immerse therm. in cold water. Bring to a boil.
At sea level water boils at 212 degrees <on a sunny day.> If your water
boils at 210 degrees, you should reduce the cooking time by 2 degrees. Most
of the time, water boils here about 208 d. Try not to cook candies on a
rainy day. The barometric pressure, when the air is heavy, holds the
mercury in your thermometer down. "Make candy when the sun shines," motto
of a good candy maker. *I recommend a TAYLOR or WILTON thermometer. Use a
thin (good quality) pan for candies that MUST STAY IN THE PAN for any
length of time for cooling. If you leave the thermometer in the pan, you
may notice the temp. rising even after the candy is removed fro the stove.
Using a heavy pan, your candy will burn, in this case. Use a HEAVY PAN for
fudges, fondants, etc., that are to be dumped immediately. Dolores McCann,
