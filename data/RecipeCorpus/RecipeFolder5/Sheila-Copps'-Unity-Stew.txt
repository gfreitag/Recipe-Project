Monday, June 18, 1990 Sheila Copps' Unity Stew Cook beef in 3 cups of water
until almost tender. Add vegetables and seasonings. Cook over low heat
until tender. Turn into baking dish. Make biscuits by combining dry
ingredients and cutting in shortening until mixture resembles coarse
crumbs. Make a well in the centre and add the milk all at once. Stir batter
vigorously until it comes freely from the side of the bowl. Knead lightly
on a floured board for a few seconds and pat into a thickness of 1/2-inch.
Cut into 1-1/2 inch biscuits and place biscuits over surface of stew. Bake
at 450F until biscuits are golden brown.

Serves 4.
