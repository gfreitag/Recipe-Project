Title: Pineapple Upside-Down Cake
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Flour
1 c  Yellow cornmeal
1/3 c  Madeira
1 lb Pineapple; peeled
- cut into 1/2" thick slices
- core removed
3/4 c  Dark brown sugar, packed
2/3 c  Granulated sugar
3/4 c  Unsalted butter
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg or mace
2    Eggs
2    Egg yolks
1 1/2 c  Milk
2 ts Baking powder
PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Cream together granulated sugar and 1/2 cup butter at
medium speed in mixer bowl until smooth. Lower speed; add vanilla, nutmeg,
eggs, yolks and milk. Mix until incorporated. Add baking powder and salt,
then flour and cornmeal. Mix until fluffy. Set aside. Combine remaining 1/4
cup butter, Madeira and pineapple in heavy, 10-inch oven-proof skillet over
medium heat and cook 20 minutes. Pineapple will release a lot of liquid.
Remove pineapple with slotted spoon and reserve. Continue cooking until
liquid is reduced nearly to a glaze. Add brown sugar and cook until mixture
becomes smooth, about 2 minutes. Replace pineapple slices, arranging them
nicely in syrup. Pour cake batter over fruit. Bake on middle rack 20 to 25
minutes. When done, wooden pick inserted into center of cake will come out
clean. Place large platter over skillet and turn upside down to remove cake
from skillet. Let cool before serving.
