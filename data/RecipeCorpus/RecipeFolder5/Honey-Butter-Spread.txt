Title: Honey Butter Spread
Categories: Spreads
Yield: 8 servings
1 tb Honey.
1/4 c  Soft butter or margarine
Stir to combine.  This is enough to spread 8 slices of bread. Because the
honey promotes browning, use this on pockets which only have to brown and
heat through.  If used on egg sandwiches,etc... the bread may over brown
before the egg finishes cooking.
