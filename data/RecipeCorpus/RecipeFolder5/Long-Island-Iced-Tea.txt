Put all in a glass and stir and watch out. Not my idea of a way to consume
alcohol (I would prefer too much wine or champagne <grin>), but I believe
this was the recipe. Does taste close to iced tea though... --Michelle M.

My boyfriend is a "working manager" of a bar here... i.e., he bartends. He
said to add these to the preceding ingredients:

1/2 shot 151 Rum (in addition to the regular rum) 1/2 shot Triple Sec or
Cointreau

I only tried one of these... I agree with Michelle... at least with wine or
champagne it requires a few hours of sipping before you pass out, instead
of a few minutes <big GRIN>.

BTW- I just asked Jim if he was sure that both 151 and regular rum were
used, and why... he said "to hurt people". Good enough reason for
