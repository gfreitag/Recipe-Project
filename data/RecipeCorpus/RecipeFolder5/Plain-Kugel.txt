Title: Plain Kugel
Categories: Ethnic
Yield: 10 servings
-butter if dairy is OK
1 lb Noodles,
6    Egg
Salt; pepper to taste
1/4 lb Margarine; parve or
This is the simplest way to make a kugel and in my mind the best! Combine
butter with hot cooked noodles, Add eggs and stir until blended in. Season
to taste. put in 9 x 13 pan and bake at 350 for one hour. Serve with
roasted anything. It's a forgiving recipe. For a lighter taller kugel..beat
whites first; but I never do!   This is the good old fashioned way of
serving what's   'bad' for you but tastes so good. These days i only make
it for special occasions...like when little Sara comes to dinner.
