Title: Krumiri
Categories: Cookies, Italian
Yield: 48 servings
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Yellow cornmeal
1 c  Unsalted butter
2/3 c  Sugar
3    Egg yolks
PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 325F. Beat the butter with the sugar by hand, with a
hand mixer set at medium speed, or in a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the
paddle. Continue beating until the mixture lightens both in texture and
color, about 4 or 5 minutes. Beat in the vanilla, then the yolks, one at a
time, beating smooth after each addition. Stir the flour and cornmeal
together, and stir into the butter mixture by hand. Line 2 or 3 cookie
sheets with parchment paper and pipe the Krumiri in horseshoe or stick
shapes, using a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tube (Ateco #4).
Bake about 15 minutes. Remove from pans and cool on a rack.

VARIATION OF KRUMIRI: SCHIACCATINE DI GRANTURCO. These wonderful biscotti
are always on the bar at Tonino and Claudia Verro's charming inn, Contea,
at Neive, near Alba in Piemonte. The surrounding area, known as the Langhe
for its situation in the Langa hills, has some of Italy's most breathtaking
natural scenery, as well as excellent wine and Grappa.

FOLLOW THE RECIPE FOR KRUMIRI, but do not pipe the dough. Divide the dough
in half and place each half on a piece of parchment or wax paper. Shape the
dough into a rough log about 1-inch diameter and about 6 inches long. Roll
and tighten the paper around the dough, to make it perfectly cylindrical.
Chill the cylinders of dough about 1 hour, until firm. Remove one piece at
a time from the refrigerator and slice the cylinder into disks 1/4-inch
thick. Arrange the disks of dough on paper-lined cookie sheets, 1 inch
apart on all sides. Continue with the other cylinder of dough. Bake as for
the Krumiri.
