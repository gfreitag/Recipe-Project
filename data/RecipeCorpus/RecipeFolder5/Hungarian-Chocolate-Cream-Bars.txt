Of all my recipes, this is the only one that I have never given out-its
raves convinced me in earlier years to keep it only as my own. It is
singularly the best chocolate dessert I have ever tasted!

Editor's Note: This recipe contains rum. If you prefer not to use rum, the
brownies still taste fantastic.

To make cake: preheat oven to 350ø. Grease 9 x 13-inch pan. Line pan with
wax paper and grease the wax paper.

Beat the egg whites lightly, add cream of tartar and beat at a high speed.
When shiny, gradually add 1/3 cup of sugar, continuing to beat until stiff.

In a separate mixing bowl, place the egg yolks, remaining sugar and butter
and beat until light and fluffy. Add the cocoa and mix thoroughly. Add a
large dollop of egg whites to chocolate mixture and whip until blended.
Then pour the rest of the egg whites over the egg mixture and sprinkle the
flour over the egg whites. Fold gently with a spatula until the egg whites
and flour are incorporated.

Immediately spread the batter in the prepared pan. Smooth out to edges and
corners. Bake 10-15 minutes at 350ø until cake is done. Run a knife around
edges and invert cake on a wire rack to cool.

To make filling: in a saucepan, combine cream, chocolate chips and instant
coffee. Cook over low heat until mixture is smooth and slightly thickened.
Cover saucepan and refrigerate until very cold. When chilled, add rum and
whip in a chilled bowl at medium speed until firm. Be careful not to over
beat or the filling may separate.

To make glaze (do not make this until all other steps are completed): in a
small saucepan, melt all ingredients over a low flame. Mix until very
smooth. Cool for 15 minutes and mix again. Use immediately, as the sauce
thickens as it cools.

To assemble, cut cake horizontally into halves. Lightly sprinkle bottom
half with rum. Spread filling over bottom layer. Place top layer on bottom
half and spread filling over top. Refrigerate or freeze until very firm.
When very cold, set the cake on a wire rack. Pour the warm glaze over the
cake. Refrigerate again until firm. Cut with a sharp knife, wiping the
blade after each cut. You can freeze cut squares.
