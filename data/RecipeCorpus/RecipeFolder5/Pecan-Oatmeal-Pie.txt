OATMEAL PECAN PIE (Bert Green) 1. Roll out the Rummed Oat Crust dough on a
lightly floured board, and line a 9-inch pie plate with it. Trim and flute
the edges.

2. Preheat the oven to 400F.

3. Place the oats in a medium-sized skillet over medium heat. Cook,
stirring constantly, until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Allow to cool.

4. Lightly beat the eggs in a large bowl. Beat in the honey, both sugars,
pepper, butter, cream and vanilla. Stir in the oats and the pecan pieces.
Pour into the pie shell and bake 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325F and
continue to bake until the filling is firm, about 30 minutes longer. Serve
warm.

Serves 8.
