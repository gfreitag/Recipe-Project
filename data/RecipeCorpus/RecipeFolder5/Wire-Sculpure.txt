Title: Wire Sculpure
Categories: Misc.
Yield: 1 servings
Wood bases
Staple gun
Stiff wire
Thin wire
Have child decide on a subject for their sculpture.  Help them make a base
form from the stiff wire.  Then have them wrap the form with the thin wire
until he or she is satified with the shape.  Staple form to a wooden base
with staple gun. (coat hanger wire works well for a base, and something
like phone wire works great as the thinner wire.)
