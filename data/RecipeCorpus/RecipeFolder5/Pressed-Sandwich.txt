Title: Pressed Sandwich
Categories: Misc.
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 md Onion
- peeled & thinly sliced
4 sl Brie cheese, 2 oz each
8 oz Cooked meat or poultry
- diced or sliced
2    Long loaves French bread
-=OR=- Italian bread
8    Bacon rashers
DEFROST COOKED MEAT, if necessary. Cut the ends off the bread and cut each
loaf in half the short way. Remove the center of the bread. (Save the white
centers for breadcrumbs.) Set the hollow loaves aside. Arrange the bacon in
a large skillet or fry pan and place over medium heat. Cook, turning once,
until crisp. Remove the bacon, drain on paper towels and discard the fat in
the pan. Replace the pan on the stove, add 2 tablespoons oil and the
onions. Cover and cook until soft, about 7 minutes. Uncover, increase heat
to high and cook, stirring often until onions begin to dry out and turn a
light golden color, another 10 minutes or so. Remove from the heat, scrape
the onions into a bowl and set aside. Stuff a cheese slice and a bacon
rasher in each loaf of bread. Using the handle of a large wooden spoon,
stuff in the meat and onions. Choose a skillet or roasting pan large enough
to hold 4 sandwiches and choose a flat cover that is smaller than the pan.
Heat half the remaining oil over low heat, place the sandwiches in the
skillet with the cover on top of the sandwiches. Place a 2-pound weight on
the cover and cook for about 5 minutes. Remove the cover, turn the
sandwiches and add the remaining oil. Replace the cover and press down with
the weights. Cook another 5 minutes. Remove the sandwiches from the heat
and keep warm in a 250F oven while you cook the remaining 2 sandwiches. To
serve, cut each sandwich in half, then diagonally cut each half into
triangular pieces.
