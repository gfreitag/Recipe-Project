Title: Walnut Spread
Categories: Pickles, Spreads
Yield: 8 servings
2 ts Olive oil
1/2 ts Ground cumin
Garnish of parsley or water
Cress and walnut halves
15    Walnuts, shelled (about 1
Cup)
1/4 ts Ground pepper
2 ts Liquamen (sep. recipe)
2 ts Grape juice or sweet wine
1) Grind the walnuts in a blender, or pound them in a mortar until
pulverized.  Transfer to a mixing bowl.

2) Add the remaining ingredients and blend well.  Place the spread on a
flat serving dish and form into the shape of a fish.  Decorate by
surrounding with parsley (or cress) and unbroken walnut halves.

3) Serve with bread, rolls, crackers, or by itself. NOTE: The Romans
preferred the taste of walnuts with their thin inner skins removed. To do
this, drop the walnut meats into boiling water for 30 seconds. Drain
immediately, rinse under cold water, and then peel off the thin inner
skins.
