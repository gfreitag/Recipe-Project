Title: Apricot Squares
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Chopped almonds or walnuts
1/2 ts Double-acting baking powder
1/2 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Salt
Confectioners sugar
2/3 c  Dried apricots
1/2 c  Butter, softened
1/4 c  Sugar
1 1/3 c  Flour, divided
1 c  Light brown sugar, packed
2    Eggs
You can use either almonds or walnuts in this recipe-each gives a very
different flavor.

In a small saucepan, place apricots and cover with water. Cook, covered,
over low heat for 15 minutes. Drain, and when apricots are cool enough to
handle, chop finely. Set aside.

Preheat oven to 350ø. Grease 8 x 8-inch baking pan. In a large bowl, beat
butter, sugar and 1 cup flour until well mixed and crumbly; pat into bottom
of pan. Bake 20 minutes at 350ø or just until golden.

While batter is in oven, use the same bowl to mix all remaining
ingredients (including apricots) except confectioners sugar. Pour over
baked layer and return to oven for 25 minutes.

Remove from oven; cool in pan before cutting in squares or oblongs with a
sharp knife. Dust with confectioners sugar.

Yield: 16-20 squares or oblongs. Martina Boudreau, St. Louis, MO
