PIZZA CRUST

Dissolve yeast in water. Add oil, honey, salt, and 1 cup whole wheat flour,
and mix well. Cover and set in warm place until light and bubbly. Add
remaining wheat flour and as much white flour as the dough wants. Knead for
10 minutes or more. Grease top of dough, put in oiled bowl, cover, let rise
35-45 minutes. After 1st rise, punch down, knead briefly, allow it to rest
about 10 minutes -- pat it down occasionally.

Heat pizza stone in 400F oven. On a cornmeal-covered board (lots of
cornmeal), roll, pound, and push dough into a circle. Take out stone, slide
dough onto it, top with sauce and pizza ingredients. Cook pizza 10 to 15
mins.
