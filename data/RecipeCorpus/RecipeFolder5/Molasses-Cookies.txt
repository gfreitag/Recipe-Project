There are a great variety of shapes and fillings you can use when making
hand shaped cookies. They tend to be more time consuming to make than other
types of cookies because each one must be individually shaped. It's well
worth the extra time, and you may find you enjoy shaping the cookies as
much as eating them!

Dark, fragrant, dunk-them-in-milk-or-coffee cookies-like great grandmother
used to bake.

In a large bowl, cream margarine or shortening with sugar. Add egg and
blend. Add molasses and spices; mix well. Add flour and baking soda and
blend. Chill dough 30 minutes or overnight (covered tightly).

Preheat oven to 325ø. Shape dough into small balls, roll in sugar and
place 2-inches apart on cookie sheet. Bake at 325ø for 10-12 minutes.
Remove from oven and cool on wire racks.
