Title: Nanny's Irish Bread
Categories: Breads, Desserts, Irish
Yield: 10 servings
16 oz Sour Cream
3 ea Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
1 x  Raisins-as much as you like
4 c  All Purpose Flour
3 ts Baking Powder
1 1/2 ts Baking Soda
1 c  Sugar
Mix together all dry ingredients:  the flour, sugar, baking powder, and
baking soda.  In a separate bowl,  mix together all wet ingredients: the
sour cream,  eggs, and vanilla. Now mix the dry ingredients into the wet
ingredients.  Mix thoroughly.  Should be a  slightly sticky dough texture.
Add the raisins to  taste.  My family likes a lot of raisins, so I put in
enough so that there's a raisin in almost every bite! Bake at 325 degrees
for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or  until skewer comes out clean.
:::This recipe came from my grandmother, Julia O'Malley, who was very
affectionately called "Nanny" by her 40 or so grandchildren. She was born
and raised in County Meath, Ireland, where this bread was a staple. She
lived to be 98 years young, and fed me this Irish Bread 'till the end! It
is a pleasure to honor her memory by sharing it with you.
