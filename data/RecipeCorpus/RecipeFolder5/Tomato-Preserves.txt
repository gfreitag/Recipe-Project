Contributed to the echo by: Janice Norman TOMATO PRESERVES In a wide
preserving pan boil the sugar and water to a syrup. Add the tomatoes,
skinned and sliced. Boil steadily, stirring fairly often, for about 35
minutes. Put in the vanilla bean (vanilla essence will not do). Cook for
approximately 10-15 minutes longer, or until setting point is reached.
Remove the vanilla pod, skim the jam, and let it cool for a few minutes
before turning it into small jars.

The cookbook says this is "particularly good when eaten in the French way,
as a sweet, with fresh cream cheese or plain pouring cream."
