This is an elegant cookie with a sweet almond flavor.

and 1/4 cup sugar. With mixer at medium speed, beat ingredients until well
mixed, occasionally scraping bowl with rubber spatula. (Mixture will be
crumbly.)

With hands, shape into ball. If dough is too soft to roll out, cover and
refrigerate until firm.

Preheat oven to 325ø.

On lightly floured surface, with floured rolling pin, roll dough into 12 x
8-inch rectangle. Using pastry wheel or knife, cut into strips 3 x 1-inch.
Place strips on greased cookie sheets and brush with slightly beaten egg
whites.

In a small bowl, mix remaining 1/4 cup sugar with cinnamon and almonds;
sprinkle on cookies. Bake 15 minutes at 325ø or until golden. With pancake
turner, remove cookies to wire racks and allow to cool.
