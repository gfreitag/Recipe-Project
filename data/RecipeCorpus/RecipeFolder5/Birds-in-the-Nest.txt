Title: Birds in the Nest
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Vanilla
1 pn Salt
1/2 c  Ground nuts
Jelly-your favorite flavor
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Butter or shortening
2    Eggs, separated
2 tb Water
2 c  Unsifted flour
These cookies have been a "must" on my family's holiday table since I was
a little girl. My earliest memories of "birds in the nest" take me back to
my maternal grandmother's house where she filled each "nest" according to
the favorite jelly flavor of each of her grandchildren.

In a large bowl, cream the sugar and butter or shortening. Add egg yolks,
water, flour, vanilla and salt. Mix well and compress into a ball.

Preheat oven to 350ø.

Break pieces off to form small, walnut-size balls. Dip each ball in
unbeaten egg whites, then roll in ground nuts. Slightly flatten ball to
form disk, then press finger in center to form a small well. Fill the well
with a drop of jelly. (Don't put in to much or it will melt over the side
of the cookie.)

Bake at 350ø for 15-20 minutes on a greased cookie sheet Remove from oven
and cool cookies on wire racks.

Yield: about 4 dozen. Bunny Polmer, Editor, Kitchen Bazaar Times,
