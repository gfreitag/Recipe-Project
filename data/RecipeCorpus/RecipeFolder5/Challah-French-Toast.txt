Title: Challah French Toast
Categories: Breakfast, Breads, French
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
4 tb To 6 T clarified butter
8 sl Challah, cut 1-inch thick
-MICHAEL HATALA   (RJHP21A)
6    Eggs
1/2 c  Heavy cream, half-and-half
-or milk
Beat the eggs together with cream, half-and-half, or milk. Beat in cinnamon
and salt. Melt the butter in a large frying pan. Dip the challah slices,
one at a time, into the egg mixture, making sure that each slice is well
coated. The challah should absorb a little of the egg mixture but not
enough to get soggy. Fry each battered challah slice for 2-3 minutes on
each side until they are golden brown. Don't fry too fast or the inside
will be wet and gooey. Serve with your favorite jam, maple syrup, honey,
cinnamon, sugar, or plain. NOTE: Heavy cream really is the best liquid to
use in this recipe.
