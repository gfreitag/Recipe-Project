Yield: 10 servings
1/4 ts Ground cumin
6 oz Medium-size peeled shrimp,
-raw, thawed if frozen
2 tb Creamed coconut, diced
5    Filo pastry sheets
1/4 c  Butter or ghee, melted
Fresh Italian parsley sprigs
1 tb Sesame oil
2 tb Corn oil
1    Garlic clove, crushed
1    Onion, finely chopped
1    Piece ginger root (1"),

1/2 ts Turmeric

Preheat oven to 350'F. (175'C.). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Heat sesame
and corn oil in a saucepan. Add garlic, onion and ginger. Fry gently 5
minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add turmeric, chili powder and cumin. Fry gently 2 minutes. Add shrimp,
cover and cook gently 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from heat,
stir in creamed coconut and cool.

Work with 1-2 sheets of filo pastry at a time; cover remainder with a damp
cloth. Cut sheet of pastry in half lengthwise and then fold each piece in
half lengthwise to make 2 long narrow strips. Spoon a portion of shrimp
mixture in 1 corner of each strip of pastry. Brush pastry all over with a
small amount of melted butter or ghee.

Fold pastry and filling over at right angles to make a triangle. Continue
folding in this way along pastry strip to form a triangular parcel. Brush
with melted butter or ghee and place on greased baking sheet. Repeat with
remaining pastry and shrimp mixture.

Bake in preheated oven 20 minutes. Brush with remaining melted butter or
ghee and return to oven 5-10 minutes or until puffs are golden brown.
Garnish with pastry sprigs, if desired, and serve warm.
