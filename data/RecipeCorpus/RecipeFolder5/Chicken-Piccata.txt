Title: Chicken Piccata
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
2    Fresh lemons **
1    Small jar of capers
Small amount of salt
Freshly ground pepper
4    Chicken breasts *
1/2    Cube of butter
4 tb Vegetable oil
1    Clove garlic, mashed
1/2 c  Chopped Italian parsley
* boned, skinned and pounded to 1\4" thick ** slice one thinly and squeeze
the other of its juice
===========================================================================

Cut boned, skinned, pounded chicken breasts into eight serving pieces (4
chicken breasts will serve 6 people as it is better to have some leftover
than not enough).  Melt butter in non-stick pan.  Add vegetable oil and
heat till sizzling.  Quickly saute garlic in oil and remove piece of garlic
before it gets brown or it will taste bitter.  Quickly saute over medium
high heat the flattened chicken breasts.  Sprinkle with freshly ground
black pepper and the juice of the one lemon.  (DO NOT SALT NOW.) When you
turn the chicken breast portions, also place in pan the chopped Italian
parsley and the thinly sliced lemon and let that saute briefly, too. The
chicken will only take about a minute or so on each side so make sure
everything else is ready.  Add drained jar of capers to the pan and swirl
it in the oil/butter so everything is well coated with the garlic and lemon
flavor.  Salt sparingly.

To serve, place over a bed of rice, cous cous or fettucine on an oblong
platter, overlapping portions of chicken piccata and drizzling the
oil\butter\garlic\parsley and capers down the center of the chicken
portions.  Yield: 6 servings
