Just the smell of these cookies baking is enough to get you in the holiday
spirit.

In a large mixing bowl, cream butter with brown sugar. Beat eggs and
extracts. In another bowl, add sifted flour and mix baking powder, salt,
pepper and spices. Gradually add flour butter mixture, mixing well after
each addition. Chill 2 hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 375Ã¸. Shape dough with two teaspoons into ovals and place
on ungreased baking sheets. Bake 8-10 minutes. Carefully remove cookies
from baking sheets to wire racks and sprinkle with confectioners sugar.
Cool and store in airtight containers. These cookies keep well and mellow
with age. They're their best about 5-8 days after baking.
