DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
** Thick milk is soured milk.
Scald thick milk by baking it at 350-F for a few minutes; allow to
remain long enough to bake the curds. Drain off the water, put curds
in an earthen vessel and keep at a moderately warm temperature (about
75-F). Each day for a week, add new baked curds. At the end of a week,
pour the curds into a heated pan and let simmer very slowly; bring to
a slow boil without any stirring. Add a pinch of salt, 1 tsp of baking
soda dissolved in 1 cup of fresh sweet cream and 1/2 pound of butter.
Stir the mixture; continue boiling for 15 minutes. Add 2 or 3 beaten
eggs and pour mixture into small cheese cups.
