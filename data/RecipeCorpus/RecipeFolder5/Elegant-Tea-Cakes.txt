Serve these not-too-sweet cookies in the traditional English fashion with
your favorite cup of tea. They are delicious with a dab of jam or marmalade
and hold up well when dunking.

In a bowl, cream butter with sugar until very light. Add well beaten egg,
cream and vanilla. In a separate bowl, sift flour with baking powder; add
creamed mixture and blend well. Roll dough into a log and wrap in aluminum
foil. Chill overnight, or in freezer for 2 hours if rushed for time.

Preheat oven to 350ø. Remove dough from refrigerator, slice very thin and
place on greased cookie sheet. Bake 5-8 minutes at 350ø.

Variations: For various holidays decorate with colored sugar, beads or
icing. Or substitute almond or lemon extract for the vanilla to vary the
flavor.
