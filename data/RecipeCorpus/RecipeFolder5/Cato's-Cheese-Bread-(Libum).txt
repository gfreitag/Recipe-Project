Title: Cato's Cheese Bread (Libum)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 servings
Flour
1    Egg, beaten
6    Bay leaves
2 tb Honey
1 c  Feta cheese, drained,
Crumbled, and packed into
The measuring cup
1/2 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
1) Put the cheese into a medium sized mixing bowl.  Mash well with the
fingers until it becomes a smooth, lumpless paste.  Add the flour and mix
well with the fingers.  Add the beaten egg and mix well.  The dough will be
rather sticky.

2) Divide the dough into two equal parts, then form two round, flat, 1/2
inch thick loaves.  Lay each on three bay leaves set on a greased baking
sheet, and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, or
until cooked through.

3) Remove the loaves from the oven, spread the tops with the honey, and
let cool.  Remove the bay leaves before serving. NOTE: If feta cheese is
unavailable, use 1 cup cottage cheese and add 1/4 cup extra flour (but the
taste is inferior).
