Title: Gary's Chocolate Pudding
Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 4 servings
3 oz Chocolate, unsw. baking
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 tb Oil or Butter
2 c  Milk
2 1/2 tb Cornstarch
2/3 c  Sugar
Place water into the bottom part of a double boiler.  Place on stove on
high heat.

Mix dry ingredients.  Place into top of double boiler.

Shave or grate baking chocolate.  Add to double boiler.  Pour in milk. Add
oil or butter.  Mix thoroughly.

Place top of double boiler into bottom of double boiler.  Heat mixture
while stirring constantly until water in double boiler returns to a boil
and mixture is sufficiently thickened.  Cover and continue heating for 15
minutes, stirring occasionally.

Take off heat and stir in vanilla extract.  Pour into dish(es) or mold and
chill thoroughly.

*NOTE* Increase or decrease the amount of cornstarch depending on your own
preference for the thickness.  If a molded pudding is desired, increase
cornstarch to about 3 1/2 tb.  If you are making my recipe for Chocolate
Cream Pie, increase cornstarch to about 4 1/2 tb.
