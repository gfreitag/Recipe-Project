Place tortilla on microwave-safe plate or paper plate. Microwave at HIGH 10
seconds or until just softened. Top with cheese, Pace Picante Sauce and, if
desired, optional toppings. Fold in half and microwave on HIGH 30 seconds
or until cheese melts. Let stand a minute or two before serving; cheese
will be very hot. Top with guacamole, if desired, and serve with additional
