Title: Stuffed Cabbage
Categories: Beef, Veal, Pork/ham
Yield: 6 servings
1 lb Ground meat
-(beef, veal, pork
- or a combination)
Salt and pepper; as desired
1 c  Canned tomatoes; chopped
1 c  Sour cream
1 ts Flour
12 lg Cabbage leaves
1/2 c  Dry bread crumbs
1/2 c  Milk or chicken broth
1    Onion; finely minced
1 tb Butter or lard
1 tb Thyme
1    Egg
TO SEPARATE THE CABBAGE leaves, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and
plunge in a whole head of cabbage. As soon as the water returns to the
boil, drain the cabbage. Carefully remove the outer leaves. Combine the
bread crumbs and milk in a large work bowl and set aside. Cook the onion in
the butter until soft and add it to the bread crumbs. Add the thyme, egg,
ground meat, salt and pepper and mix well. Place a cabbage leaf on a work
surface and place a heaping tablespoon or 2 of stuffing in the center. Roll
up the cabbage to enclose the stuffing. Pack the stuffed leaves into a
lidded casserole. Place in preheated 350F oven and bake for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, mix the tomatoes, flour and sour cream together. Pour this over
the cabbage, replace the cover and cook another 15 minutes.
