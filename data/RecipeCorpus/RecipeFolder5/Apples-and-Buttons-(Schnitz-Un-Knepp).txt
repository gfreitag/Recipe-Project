DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
*** My notes: I think the recipes in this cookbook all assume using a
whole, uncooked ham. I would omit the step of boiling ham for 3 hours
if using a cooked ham.
Pick over and wash dried apples. Cover with water and let soak over
night or for a number of hours. In the morning, cover ham with cold
water and let boil for 3 hours. Add the apples and water in which they
have been soaked and continue to boil for another hour. Add brown
sugar. Make dumplings by sifting together the flour, salt, pepper and
baking powder. Stir in the beaten egg, milk (enough to make fairly
moist, stiff batter), and melted butter. Drop the batter by spoonfuls
into the hot liquid with the ham and apples. Cover kettle tight and
cook dumplings for 15 minutes. Serve piping hot on large platter.
