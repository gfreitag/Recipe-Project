2. Scrub potatoes well under cold running water. Dry thoroughly with paper
towels. With fork, prick skins over entire surface. (Brush potatoes with
salad oil if you like skins soft after baking.) 3. Place potatoes on oven
rack; bake 50 to 60 minutes, or until easily pierced with fork or soft when
squeezed. 4. Slash an X on top of each potato. Then, holding potato with
pot holders,squeeze ends so steam can escape and potato puffs up. 5. Add a
pat of butter to each; sprinkle with salt, pepper and paprika. Makes 4
