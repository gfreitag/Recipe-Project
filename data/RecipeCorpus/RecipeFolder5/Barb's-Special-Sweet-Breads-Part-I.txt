For the dough:
Put the water in a mixing bowl and sprinkle the yeast over it. Stir until
the yeast has dissolved. Beat the egg into the yeast mixture, and set
aside.
Sift together the flour, sugar, and salt.  Add the yeast mixture.  Knead
until the mix forms a ball- if too moist add a bit more flour.  Knead 10
minutes more.
Roll out to an 11" square. Spread 1/2 cup butter over the surface of the
dough.  Fold the dough into thirds and wrap in a damp cloth.  Refrigerate
20 minutes. Repeat this process beginning from rolling out the dough, two
more times.
While the dough is in the refrigerator the last time, you should prepare
the fillings, icings or other recipes you will need for the finished
pastries.
The following parts will give you the variety of pastries made with this
dough, and the methods.  They will be followed by additional recipes needed
to prepare the pastries.
