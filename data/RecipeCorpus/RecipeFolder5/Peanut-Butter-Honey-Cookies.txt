Ice Box Cookies

Ice box cookies are a boon for the busy person because they can be
prepared in advance and stored in the freezer until needed. Just slice and
bake when desired, and you have a great home made cookie.

If you like, use whole wheat flour and add 1/2 cup ground peanuts to the
dough.

In a large bowl, cream the shortening and peanut butter, blending well.
Add the honey, mixing it in thoroughly. Gradually blend in sugar. Beat in
egg and vanilla.

Sift together the flour with baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir the
dry ingredients into the creamed mixture. Stir in the raisins, if using.
Shape in a roll. Wrap in waxed paper and chill thoroughly.

Preheat oven to 350ø. Cut chilled dough into thin slices and bake on
greased cookie sheets at 350ø for 10-12 minutes.

Yield: 4-5 dozen. Jacqueline E. Hamilton, Cooking Classics, Gaithersberg
