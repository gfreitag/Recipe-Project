DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
Separate one hog's head into halves. Take out the eyes and brains.
Scrape and thoroughly clean the head. Put 1/2 of the head, along with
the liver, heart and sweetbreads of the hog into a large kettle and
cover with 4 or 5 quarts of cold water. Simmer gently for 2 or 3
hours, or until the meat falls from the bones. Skim off grease
carefully from the surface; remove meat, chop fine and weigh the meat.
For every 3 pounds of meat, use 2 pounds of meal (2 parts corn meal
and 1 part buckwheat flour), 2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp sage,
and 1 tsp mace. Cook slowly over low flame about 1 hour. Pour into pan
and let stand until cold. Cut in slices and fry until golden brown.
