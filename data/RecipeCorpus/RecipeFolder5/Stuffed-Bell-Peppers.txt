Title: Stuffed Bell Peppers
Categories: Ground beef, Beef
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 c  Drained stewed tomatoes
1 c  Cooked rice**
1 tb Parsley
4 md Green Bell peppers*
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 md Onion, finely chopped
2    Cloves, minced garlic
1/2 lb Ground beef
1/2 ts Salt
1. Cut top off each pepper and remove seeds and veins. Blanch in boiling
water for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and let cool.

2. In a skillet, heat oil, add onion and garlic and saute for 4 to 5
minutes.

3. Add meat, salt, pepper and thyme and cook until meat is browned.

4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the meat, tomatoes, rice and parsley.

5. Stuff each pepper with the meat mixture, place top back on each and bake
in a preheated 325 degree F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes.

*You may use yellow or red peppers as a substitute for eye appeal. One of
my favorite serving tricks to use green, red, yellow peppers in this
preparation.  Then, use a large, well garnished platter for the cooked
peppers. If you use a creole type suace, the affect is truely spectacular.

**I have from time to time cut the peppers in half lenghtwise in order to
add plate coverage. This is especially important if the peppers are small.
It gives the appearence of quantity with out the bulk.  When I do this I
increase the cooked rice to 1 1/2 cups.  Your mileage may vary!
