3 lb Soup meat
2 qt Water
4    Egg
1 c  Flour
2 tb Butter
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Milk
DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
Add the water to the soup meat, season to taste and cook slowly for
several hours. A half hour before serving time, make soup balls as
follows: combine the salt and flour and work in the butter. Beat the
eggs and add to flour. Stir in the milk, using only enough to make
batter thin enough to drop by spoon. Drop by spoonfuls into the
boiling hot broth and cook for 10 minutes. Serve in hot soup at once.
