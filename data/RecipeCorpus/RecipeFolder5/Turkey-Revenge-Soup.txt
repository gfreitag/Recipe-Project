Cut wings off carcass and cut up the remaining bird as you would a
chicken for frying.  Place the carcass pieces and any left over peelings &
parings into a stock pot and fill with water.  Add garlic cloves.  Fill the
stock pot with water and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and let
it cook until the liquid is reduced by 1/3.  Remove from heat to cool cover
and refrigerate overnight.  The next day remove the congealed fat from the
top of the broth.  Drain the contents through a collander into another
large pot.  Return the broth to the stock pot.  Go through the collander
and remove vegetable & garlic pieces and discard.  Next, go through the
turkey remnants and pull out all the meat and add to the stock pot. Add any
left over vegetables, carrots, celery, corn, green beans and the onion to
the pot.  There should be *just* enough liquid to cover the contents. Place
over heat and bring to a boil.  While you're waiting, cook the egg noodles
per package directions and drain.  Simmer the soup just long enough to cook
the carrots.  Add 2 quarts of water, egg noodles and left over gravy.
Adjust seasonings (salt & pepper).  Stir well, let simmer long enough to
heat noodles and serve.

Makes a bunch!
