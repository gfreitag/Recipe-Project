Title: Almond Spice Cookies
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 servings
2 ts Instant coffee powder
1/2 ts Almond extract
1 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Dark brown sugar,*
3 lg (extra) or jumbo eggs
10 oz Slivered blanched almonds**
4 c  All-purpose flour
3 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Ginger
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
1 c  Butter
* firmly packed ** (2 1/2 - 3 cups)

These cookies go well with after dinner coffee or tea.

In a bowl, sift together the flour, cinnamon, ginger, salt and baking soda
and set aside.

In a large bowl, cream the butter. Add the coffee, almond extract,
granulated and brown sugars and beat well. Add the eggs one at a time until
smooth after each addition. On low speed gradually add the sifted dry
ingredients, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and beating only until
the mixture is smooth. Gently mix in the almonds.

Spread out two pieces of wax paper. place large spoonfuls of the dough
lengthwise on each piece of paper to form heavy strips about 10-11 inches
long. Fold the long sides of the paper p against the dough and, pressing
against the paper with your hands, shape each strip of dough into a smooth
oblong 12 inches long, 3 inches wide, and about 1 inch thick. Wrap the
dough in the wax paper.

Slide a cookie sheet under both packages of dough and transfer them to the
freezer or refrigerator for several hours or overnight. This slices best
when dough is frozen solid.

Preheat oven to 375ø. Unwrap one roll of dough at a time. Place dough on a
cutting board. With a very sharp knife cut the dough into 1/4-inch slices
and place them 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.

Bake the cookies for about 10-12 minutes at 375ø. The cookies are done
when they are slightly colored and spring back when lightly pressed with a
fingertip.
