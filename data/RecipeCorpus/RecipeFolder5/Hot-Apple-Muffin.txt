Apple Muffins TOPPING: To prepare the topping, core and peel the apples,
keeping them whole. Cut each one into 4 to 5 thick rings. Mix the sugar and
cinnamon together and coat the apple rings. Reserve.

MUFFIN: Sift together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. In another bowl
beat the eggs, add the milk and melted butter. Stir the liquid very quickly
into the flour mixture - do not beat and do not worry about lumps. Speed is
essential. Fold in the chopped apples. Fill 24 (5in.) greased muffins tins
or paper cases, filled to one-third, and put one cinnamon apple ring on
each muffin.

Bake in a preheated hot oven 425F, for 15 to 25 minutes, until cooked.
Remove from tins and serve hot.
