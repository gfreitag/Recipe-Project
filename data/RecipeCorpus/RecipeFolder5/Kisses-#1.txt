Title: Kisses #1
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Lemon juice
3/4 lb Walnuts,broken into quarters
4    Egg whites
1 lb Confectioners sugar
If you have egg whites left over from other recipes, use them for making
kisses. For the holidays you can dress them up by sprinkling some green
sugar or red cinnamon hearts on each kiss to make them more festive.

Preheat oven to 250ø.

In a large bowl, beat egg whites until stiff; add sugar and lemon juice.
Continue beating on high speed until mixture is very stiff (this takes a
few minutes). Stir in nuts.

With a teaspoon, place small mounds on a greased and floured cookie sheet.
Bake at 250ø for about 30 minutes. Kisses should be set, but not brown.

Variation: Substitute chocolate chips for walnuts.

Yield: 3 dozen. Maria Bappert, Foods editor, The good news weekly, Chicago,
