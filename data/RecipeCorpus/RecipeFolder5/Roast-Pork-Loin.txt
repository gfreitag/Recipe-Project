Categories: Pork/ham
Yield: 8 servings
-(about 6-to-7 lbs and
- containing 11-or-12 chops)
1 md Onion
- peeled and roughly chopped
2    Celery stalks
- roughly sliced
2 tb Flour
2 c  All-purpose broth
-OR low-sodium chicken broth
1 c  Southern Comfort
1 tb Salt
Freshly ground pepper
- to taste
1 tb Fresh thyme leaves; -=OR=-
1 ts -Dried thyme
1 tb Finely minced garlic
3 tb Olive oil
1 ts Ground coriander
1    Pork loin, with rib bones
- chine bone removed,
COMBINE SALT, PEPPER, THYME, garlic and oil in a blender or small food
processor and blend to a paste-like consistency. Scrape into a small bowl.
Place pork on a work surface, rub the surface with all the herb paste and
place the loin in the refrigerator for 2 hours or up to 8 hours. Preheat
oven to 400F. Place the pork in the oven on a rack in a roasting pan and
immediately reduce heat to 350F. Roast for 2 hours. After 1 hour add the
onions and celery. As the roast cooks, remove any excess fat with a basting
bulb. The pork juices should run barely pink and the roast will continue to
cook while it "rests." A meat thermometer should read 165F-to-170F in the
thickest part of the roast. Remove the roasting pan from the oven and
increase the heat to 425F. Remove the roast to a plate to rest for 30
minutes before carving. Add the flour to the vegetables in the roasting
pan, mix and replace in the oven for 15 minutes. Transfer the roasting pan
to the stovetop, place over medium heat and add the broth, Southern Comfort
and any juices that have escaped from the pork. Cook, stirring, until the
gravy thickens. To serve, cut the loin into individual chops and arrange on
a serving platter. Strain the gravy through a sieve or strainer into a
sauceboat and serve on the side.
