Loosely inspired by the fresh ginger ice cream and chocolate sauce served
by Barbara Tropp at her restaurant China Moon.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with a paddle attachment, blend
the flour, the sugar, the baking soda, the salt, the cinnamon, the cloves
and the cocoa powder until the mixture is combined well. In a small bowl,
whisk together the gingerroot, the almond extract and the eggs, add the
mixture to the flour mixture, beating until a dough is formed, and stir in
the almonds. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface, knead it
several times and divide it into thirds. Working on a large buttered and
floured baking sheet, with floured hands, form each piece of dough into a
flattish log 10 inches long by 2 1/2 inches wide and arrange the logs at
least 3 inches apart on the sheet. Bake the logs in the middle of a
preheated 350F oven for 25 minutes and let them cool on the baking sheet on
the rack for 10 minutes. On a cutting board cut the logs crosswise on the
diagonal into 3/4 inch slices, arrange the biscotti, cut sides down, on the
baking sheet, and bake them in the 350F oven for 5 minutes on each side.
Transfer the biscotti to racks to cool and store them in airtight
containers. MAKES: 36 BISCOTTI
