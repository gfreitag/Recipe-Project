Title: Gifilte Fish From a Jar
Categories: Appetizers, Ethnic, Fish/sea
Yield: 6 servings
2 lg Onions
-Pepper; lots
-Salt; to taste
Take a large jar (at least 8 pieces but
1 lg Jar gifilte fish; good brand
1 bn Beets
1 bn Carrots
Here is the EASY way out...
I usually do 12)...but first get your veggies ready; slice the carrots,
beets and onions. Layer in a heavy stock pot, the beets (my Bubbe's secret
ingredient), slices of fish, onions, carrots and seasonings; repeat as many
times as is necessary with EVERYTHING but the beets. Pour the liquid from
the jar over the fish and then bring to a boil. Turn down as simmer for
about 45 minutes. Cool, remove from liquid and serve.

This tastes ALMOST a good as the real thing...try it you'll like it.
