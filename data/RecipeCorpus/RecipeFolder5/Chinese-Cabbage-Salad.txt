1    Bunch Green Onions
1    Head Chinese (Napa) Cabbage

1/2 c  Raw Sunflower Seeds
1/3 c  Sesame Seeds
3 tb Sesame Oil
3 tb Peanut Oil
2 pk Ramen Noodles (uncooked)

Prepare greens by chopping up the Napa cabbage and the green onions.  You
may use a coarse chop or shredd, depending on preference: coarser than most
cole slaw but not "bite sized" pieces.

Boil together the vinegar, 1/2 cup sesame oil, and sugar.

In a frying pan, add the dressing ingredients listed in Step II and saut
until the Ramen noodles and sesame seeds are lightly browned.  Mix with the
sweet oil and vinegar mixture and chill.

Keep greens and dressing separate until ready to serve.  Toss dressing in
with greens.  You may add cooked chicken if you like.
