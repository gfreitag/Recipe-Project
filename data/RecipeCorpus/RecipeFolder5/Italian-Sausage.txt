In a dutch oven, brown the sausages well (still in their casings) in a
little olive oil. Use tongs to remove sausage to top of pot lid. Drain off
fat if necessary, leaving about 1 T in pot. Toss in onion, green pepper and
garlic and stir to coat, scraping up the brown bits from bottom of pot. Let
cook for about 2 minutes, just 'til the onion and pepper begin to soften
(do not brown). Return sausage to pot and stir in tomatos or sauce, paste,
sugar, wine, seasonings and Parmesan. Simmer for 45-60 minutes.

Meanwhile, saute mushrooms in a dab of butter, dash of olive oil, sprinkle
of marjoram or basil and paprika. Add the mushrooms and any juice in the
pan to the saucepan during last 15 minutes of cooking. Add optional
American cheese a few minutes before serving, let melt & stir in. This
really mellows out the sauce.

Tips: You can brown pork shoulder blades or spareribs along with the
sausage. Gives a great flavor and provides a 2nd meat course if you're
having company. Use more or less wine, depending on whether you're using
whole tomatos or sauce. Just aim for a nice thick sauce. Leftovers make
great sausage sandwiches. I freeze mine a lot for quick meals later.
