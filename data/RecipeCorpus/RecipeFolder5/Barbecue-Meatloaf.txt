My favorite meatloaf recipe.

Combine the beef, bread crumbs, onion, 8 oz tomato sauce, egg, My
Seasoning, and green pepper.  Mix well and place in a loaf pan.

Combine all sauce ingredients.  Cook in a saucepan until butter melts. Pour
sauce over meat loaf and bake at 350F^. for 1 hour. While baking, the sauce
needs to be spooned over the meat occasionally.

Note: Make sure you use a pan large enough for the meat and sauce, or the
sauce will tend to boil over while it is cooking.

My Seasoning: Mix 1 part garlic powder, 1 part onion powder, 1/2 part black
pepper. Mix well before measuring and adding to the recipe.
