Contributed to the echo by: Michael Gallagher Bob, here is my variation of
a chili recipe with beans in it. If the people here don't like beans with
their chili, I'll give a substitution. DON'T change anything, for this is
the way you should make authentic Texas chili--not the cheap imitation
stuff.

Wash beans in colander and soak overnight. Wash again next day, and place
in large chili pot. Cover with water about 1/2 to 3/4 inch over beans;
simmer, covered, for about 2-1/2 hours or until done.

If substituting beans with the lean beef sirloin, brown the meat 1 pound at
a time, preferably in a non-stick skillet without any oil. Place the meat
in large chili pot. You will also need 1 more 12 ounce can of tomato sauce
and 1 to 2 10 ounce cans of fat-skimmed beef stock. You will add the extra
can of tomato sauce and the can of beef stock in the next paragraph of
directions.

Brown meat and place in large saucepan. Add all of the other ingredients
and spices. Mix well. Simmer, covered, for 1 hour. When beans are done, add
contents of saucepan to chili pot and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Makes 15
to 20 servings, 225 calories each (205 with out the oil). Salt and pepper
to taste.
