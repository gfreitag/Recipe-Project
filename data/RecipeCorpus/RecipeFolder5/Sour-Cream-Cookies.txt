Sour cream adds a special touch to many foods, including these delicious
cookies. For a perfect snack, serve with a big glass of cold milk or with
hot tea.

Preheat oven to 425ø.

In a large bowl, mix sugar, shortening, butter, egg and vanilla until
light and fluffy. Stir in remaining ingredients and mix well.

Divide dough into 3 parts. Roll out each part 1/4-inch thick on lightly
floured cloth-covered board. Cut with 2-inch cookie cutter and sprinkle
with sugar. Place on ungreased baking sheet and bake at 425ø for about 6-8
minutes, or until almost no imprint remains when touched lightly in center.
Remove to wire racks to cool.
