DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------
A dish famous in Berks County is made from the cheese as prepared in
Cheese Custard recipe. Take a cup of the cheese or curd after it has
been mashed through a fine sieve and put it in a bowl. Pour in slowly,
sweet milk or cream- half and half is a good mixture- using the back
of a spoon to make it smooth. Work in sufficient milk and cream to
bring it to the consistency of apple butter. Add salt and pepper and
spread on buttered bread. Serve with apple butter.
