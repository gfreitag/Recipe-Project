Place chicken in single layer in a pan, perferably ceramic, and sprinkle
worchestershire over top. Sprinkle on some of the oregano/basil mixture,
all of the mustard, salt and pepper, lemon juice, and 1/2 of the champagne.
Marinate chicken for 1/2 hour.

Cover bottom of large casserole with onion slices. Pour some of the
marinade over the onions. Place marinated chicken on top and place a pat of
butter on each piece. Pour remaining marinade over the chicken. Cover
chicken with frozen peas. Sprinkle on some of the oregano/basil mixture.
Sprinkle on some champagne. Cover peas with baby carrots. Sprinkle on
remaining oregano/basil and a little more champagne. Cover carrots with the
soup. Sprinkle on a little more champagne. Distribute potato halves, raw
side down, over top so that potatoes sit part way down in the soup (about
half in and half out). Sprinkle on remaining champagne.
