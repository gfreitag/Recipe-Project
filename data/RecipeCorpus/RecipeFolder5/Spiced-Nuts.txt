Title: Spiced Nuts
Categories: Microwave
Yield: 1 servings
1/8 ts Ground cloves
1 1/2 tb -Water
1 1/2 c  Pecan halves; walnut halves;
Cashews or a combination
1/2 c  Dark brn. sugar; firmly pkd.
1/2 ts -Salt
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground allspice
1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
1. In a deep, 2-quart, heat-resistant, non-metallic casserole, combine
first 7 ingredients (I use a 2 quart Pyrex mixing bowl).
2. Heat, uncovered, in Microwave Oven 1 1/2 minutes; stir occasionally.
3. Add 1/2 cup nuts at a time to syrup mixture. Stir until well coated.
With a slotted spoon lift out nuts; drain extra syrup. Place nuts in a
shallow, 1 1/2-quart, heat-resistant, non-metalic baking dish (I use
Corning Ware). Repeat with remaining nuts.
4. Heat coated nuts, uncovered, in Microwave Oven 5 minutes or until syrup
begins to harden slightly.
5. Transfer nuts to wax paper and allow to cool and harden.
This is a family favorite and so easy to make. I always use pecans. For
years I have filled some type of small container and given for gifts.
