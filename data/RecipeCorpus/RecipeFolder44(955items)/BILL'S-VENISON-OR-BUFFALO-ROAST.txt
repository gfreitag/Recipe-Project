Title: BILL'S VENISON OR BUFFALO ROAST
Categories: Check, Game, Native
Yield: 1 Guideline  Soak roast overnight in saltwater.  Rinse and dry off. Cut slits in
top side of roast about 2-3 inches apart, depending on how spicy you
want it. Alternate 1/2 clove of garlic and slices of green serano or
jalapeno peppers.  Turn the roast over, repeat.  Do not add spices or
salt.

Cover roast HEAVILY all over with cheap prepared mustard. Put in dry
pan. Cover heavily with yellow onion sliced in rings. Cover. Put in
preheated 300 degree oven. Roast til it's really tender, slice across
grain, serve with brown or wild rice and greens.

Buffalo needs to be cooked at a low heat for a long time to make it
tender. If you try to cook it on too high a heat, it will get tough,
never, never to get tender again.

This was Bill's Grandma Johnson's recipe for venison roast, but we
used it on buffalo, too, and it was great.
