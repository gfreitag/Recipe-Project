Title: BISCOTTI DI CONSUOLO (CONSOLATION BISCUITS)
Categories: Ethnic, Cookies, Desserts
Yield: 36 Cookies
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 lg Egg
1/2 c  Honey
1/4 c  Mild olive oil; or
-melted butter
Although these biscuits have an unhappy association, they are tender
and tasty. The name refers to the time during which a bereaved family
receives callers and serves them these biscotti with a glass of wine.
In Campania and the Basilicata, these customs survive in
out-of-the-way mountain villages that still cling to ancient
traditions.

Combine the flour, salt, and baking powder in a mixing bowl. Combine
the egg, honey and olive oil or butter in a bowl, beat to mix, and
pour into the flour mixture. Stir well to form a firm dough. Remove
the dough from the bowl to a floured surface and knead well, about 2
or 3 minutes. Flour the dough lightly, wrap in plastic, and allow to
rest at room temperature about 1 hour. Unwrap the dough, cut it into
12 pieces, and roll each piece into a rope about 1/4 inch in diameter
x 12 inches long. Divide each rope into three pieces. Join the ends
and form each piece into a figure eight, making sure that the seam
lies at the midpoint of the figure eight and underneath it.
Transfer the biscotti to parchment lined cookie sheets and bake them
in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes, until puffed and
light golden.

Cool the biscotti on a rack and store in a tin between sheets of wax
paper. Makes 3 dozen.
