Year 1066 Make the almond milk by simmering the almonds gently in the
water and sugar until all the flavour is extracted (about 12 hours).
Strain. Place the chicken in a large saucepan, cover with boiling
water, add the onion, bouquet garni and seasoning. Cover, bring to
the boil and simmer until the bird is tender.'About 1 1/2 -2 hours,
according to age and size.) When cooked, remove from the stock,
discard the skin and bones, cut the flesh into bite-sized pieces and
keep warm. Cook the rice in the almond milk, adding some of the
chicken stock to make up the required amount of liquid. Drain the
rice but do not dry it-it should be moist. Return the rice to the
saucepan and add the diced chicken, butter, sugar and ground almonds.
Season well. Fry the whole almonds lightly in the oil or fat until
golden. Sprinkle with a little salt. Serve the rice on a heated dish,
decorated with the fried almonds and parsley.
