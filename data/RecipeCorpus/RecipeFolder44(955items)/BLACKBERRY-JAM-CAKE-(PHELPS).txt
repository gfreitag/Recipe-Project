beating until thoroughly incorporated. Stir in jam, nuts, and
vanilla. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake until tester inserted
in centers comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on racks.

FOR GLAZE:  Combine sugar, whipping cream, and butter in heavy large
saucepan over medium heat.  Stir until syrup reaches 240 degrees on
candy thermometer (soft-ball stage). Remove from heat and stir in jam
and raisins.  Cool 30 minutes.

TO ASSEMBLE:  Even tops of cake layers with serrated knife. Transfer
one layer to shallow-rimmed platter. Spoon some of glaze over top.
Repeat with remaining layers and glaze, allowing glaze to drip down
sides and form well around bottom of cake.  Serve same day if
possible.
