Categories: Bakery, Italian, Breads
Yield: 3 Cups
1/2 ts Dried yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
1 1/2 c  Water at room temperature
3 3/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
Stir the yeast into the warm water & let proof for 10 minutes. Stir
in the remaining water & then the flour, 1 c at a time. Mix with a
wooden spoon for 3 or 4 minutes. Leave the biga in the mixing bowl.
Cover with plastic wrap & let it rise at cool room temperature for
anywhere between 6 & 24 hours.  The starter will triple in volume &
then collapse a bit. It will also be wet & very sticky when it is
ready to be used. Cover & refrigerate if not using at once. To use
the biga, scoop out the needed amount while it is cold.
