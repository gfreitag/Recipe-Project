The recipe for Blue Cheese dressing originated at the Waldorf-Astoria
many years ago. It is very thick and chunky; use as a dip, on
sandwiches and as a salad dressing. Crumble cheese by hand (chunky).
Combine all ingredients. Add crumbled blue cheese. Beat mixture by
hand until well-blended. Refrigerate 1-2 hours. This recipe makes
about 1 quart. It will keep 10-14 days in refrigerator. I double the
amount of blue cheese; I prefer the sharpest cheese available.
Increase/decrease items to taste. ENJOY!
