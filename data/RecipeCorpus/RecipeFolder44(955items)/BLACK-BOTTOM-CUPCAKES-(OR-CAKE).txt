Title: BLACK BOTTOM CUPCAKES (OR CAKE)
Categories: Chocolate, Cakes, Cupcakes
Yield: 24 Servings
12 oz Cream cheese
2    Eggs
1 2/3 c  Sugar
10 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
1 1/2 c  Flour -- sifted
1/4 c  Cocoa powder
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
1 c  Water
1/3 c  Cooking oil
1 tb Vinegar
1 ts Vanilla
INSTRUCTIONS: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Arrange 24 cupcake liners
in muffin tins or liberally grease a cake/bundt pan. Blend together
the cream cheese, eggs and 2/3 cup of the sugar in a large bowl. Stir
in the chocolate chips. Sift the remaining sugar, the flour, cocoa,
baking soda and salt into a mixing bowl. Stir in the water, oil,
vinegar and vanilla; beat until smooth. Fill cupcake liners 1/3 full
with the chocolate batter; spoon the cheese mixture on top. If using
a cake or bundt pan, scrape the batter into the pan, then top with
several layers of the cream cheese topping, spreading it thinly
because it will sink in deeper after each application. Bake until the
cakes test done -- 30 to 35 minutes for cupcakes, 40 to 45 minutes
for cake. Let cool 10 minutes before turning out on wire racks to
cool completely.
