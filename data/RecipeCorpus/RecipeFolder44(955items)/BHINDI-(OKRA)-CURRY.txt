Wash the okra, top and tail, and cut into approximately 1/4" pieces
(or leave whole after topping and tailing if preferred). Fry mustard,
coriander and fenugreek seeds in mustard oil for 2-3 minutes (cover

Add garlic, onion and ginger; fry gently for about 10 minutes more.
Make the ground spices into a paste with a little water, add to the
pan and fry for a further 10 minutes. Add okra, tomatoes, green

tender but not sloppy (about 15-20 minutes). Serves 3-4 as a main
course, 5-6 as a side vegetable.
