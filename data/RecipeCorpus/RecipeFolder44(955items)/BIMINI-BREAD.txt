Soften yeast in 1/2 cup warm water for 10 minutes. Using a large food

milk powder, sugar, oil, salt and eggs until smooth. Add 1 1/3 cups
warm water and 2 cups of the flour; beat until smooth.  Add remaining
flour, a little at a time, beating well after each addition. Stop
adding flour when a stiff dough is formed.  Without a heavy-duty
mixer or food processor, you will need to work in the last of the
flour with your hands. With dough hook or by hand on a lightly
floured surface, knead until dough is smooth and elastic.  Place in a
greased bowl and turn to grease top. Cover and let rise until double
in bulk, about 2 1/2 hours. Punch dough down and fold over edges,
pressing until air bubbles are pushed out. Divide dough into 4
pieced.  form each piece into a loaf or ball. Place in greased 8x4
inch loaf pans or 8-inch round cake pans. Cover and allow to rise
until double in size, about 1 hour.  Bake in a preheated 350 oven for
40 minutes or until nicely browned and done. Remove from pans and
cool on wire racks. Freeze extra loaves for futureuse.
