Strain, discard shells and vegetables, reserve broth and set aside.

RISOTTO (25 min) Heat 2 tablespoons oil in *large* skillet, saute
onion and garlic lightly, add shrimp, salt and pepper. Saute just
until pink. Set aside; shrimp may be cut in half, if desired.

In the same *large* skillet, over medium heat, combine oil and butter
(or use all butter or oil), saute onion and garlic until wilted but
don't brown. Add rice. Stir to coat, add a cup of the reserved shrimp
broth, cook, stirring frequently until rice has absorbed liquid. Add
diced tomato and wine. Continue cooking and stirring, adding broth 1
cup at a time, until rice is creamy and tender but al dente (about 3
cups). This should take about 18 minutes; adding shrimp during the
last 5 minutes of cooking. Add more broth if necessary.Stir in cheese
just before serving. One tablespoon of butter can also be mixed in at
the end for extra creaminess. Serve immediately.
