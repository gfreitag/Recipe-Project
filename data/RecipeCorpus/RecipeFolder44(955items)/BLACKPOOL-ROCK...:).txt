All British Sizes - Sorry!
Blackpool Rock is exported all over the world and is famous for having
names running right through it.  The method of adding the names is
beyond the scope of written explanations, and would take an actual
demonstration to learn.
To 'PULL' Sugar To pull sugar takes some
learning but can be mastered:) Turn the cooked sugar on to a oiled
slab and leave until cool enough to handle. Oil your hands, and
working quickly, pull between the hands until it acquires a lighter
colour and a satin finish. As it begins to set the mix is rolled into
a long cylinders shape and cut with a sharp knife or scissors.

Dissolve sugar in the water, add a good 3/4 ts cream of tartar, and
boil to 'Large Crack' degree [312f.]. Pour onto an oiled slab and add
coloring and flavoring. ie: Red colour for raspberry or strawberry,
yellow with pineapple essence.  Add just a pinch of tartaric acid and
the golden syrup. Work well following the directions for 'Pulling
Sugar' above.

If you you want  traditional looking rock: Set aside a small portion
and colour it red.  Roll it out thin and wrap the flavoured/coloured
mix inside it.  Lots of skill needed to get it right. Asbestos
fingers are also helpful if you wish to avoid burns. From Ron's
