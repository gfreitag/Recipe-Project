Title: BLINY
Categories: None
Yield: 2 Servings
3/4 c  Flour
1 ts Granulated sugar
1 ts Shortening
1 1/2 ts Yeast
1/2 ts Salt
1    Egg, separated
1 1/2 c  Milk
2 ts Vegetable oil
Heat 3/4 of milk to 35C (about 95F).  Add yeast till fully dissolved.
Add half of sugar, yolk, melted shortening - keep stirring. Add half
of flour. Stir batter until smooth. Cover with cloth and let stand
for 1-1/2 to 2 hours.  It should rise to double its original size.
Mix, heat remaining milk to 50C (this would be about 120F, I think --
I'm just converting the Laakso temperatures in my head, and my
Fahrenheit is a bit shaky), pour in. Fold in remaining four, sugar,
and gradually, well-beaten egg-white. Cover with cloth and leave for
2-1/2 to 3-1/2 hours.

Brush large skillet with the vegetable oil.  Heat until quite hot.
Spoon batter onto skillet to cover the surface. Turn blin over when
one side is a nice golden colour. Serve hot.

Serves two.

(I use this to hold a filling of sour cream or cottage cheese and
fruit preserves.)
