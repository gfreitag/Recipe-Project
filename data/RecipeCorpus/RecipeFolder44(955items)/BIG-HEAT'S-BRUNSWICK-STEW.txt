:

Place chicken carcasses, bay leaves, peppercorns, and pork jowl in 6
quarts of water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cook for
2 hours. Remove from heat, strain, and let cool.

Place roasting hen in a dutch oven. Add water, cover, and bake for 2
hours at 325 degrees. Remove, let cool, and pull meat into thumb
sized chunks, discarding skin and fat. Reserve.

Smoke pork shoulder for 8-12 hours, or until internal temperature
reaches 160 degrees. You may finish in a covered pan in the oven if
time is a factor; however, it must smoke for at least 8 hours. Pull
about 2 pounds into thumb sized chunks and reserve. Use the rest of
the smoked pork shoulder for barbeque.

Return stock to the stove, bring to a gentle boil, and throw
everything into the pot. Cook at a gentle boil for 1 hour. Reduce
heat to a simmer and cook for an additional 2 to 3 hours, stirring
occassionally. Remove from heat and serve immediately.
