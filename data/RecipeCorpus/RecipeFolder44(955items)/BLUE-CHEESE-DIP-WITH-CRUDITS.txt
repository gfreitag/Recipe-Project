Dips are wonderfully simple to prepare, and can be served as a snack
before a meal, or as part of a salad table. This one, best made with
Stilton, has a rich flavour that is beautifully balanced by the raw
vegetables dipped into it.

Mash the blue cheese and mix it with the grated onion. Put into the
blender with the yogurt and liquidize to a dipping consistency.

Season to taste with paprika and serve with sliced raw vegetables
such as baby carrots, cucumber, cauliflower, courgettes, mushrooms,
French beans and celery.
