-----cathy keating (rkhs20c-
2 c  Bisquick
2/3 c  Milk
1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese
1/4 c  Butter; melted
1/4 ts Garlic salt
ds Italian seasoning; generous
Combine first 3 ingredients.  It will be sticky. Spoon into 12
well-greased muffin tins.  Do not use paper liners. Combine last 3
ingredients and spread evenly over the raw batter. Bake for about
10-15 minutes at
450    until nicely browned. Lobster does. We had some the other
evening when we went to Red Lobster for dinner, and I know how
addictive they are.  We had 2 left over in our bread basket; I took
them home and nibbled on them cold later that night while I played on
the *P board. I have not tried these myself, >>> but when this recipe
was posted, the poster said they taste just like the ones Red Lobster
makes. Good luck with them. I would love to know how they turn out!
