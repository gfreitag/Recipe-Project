Note: This  is  a  concoction that I often bought from street vendors
in India.  My mouth still waters whenever I think of Bhel. The recipe
presented  here was taken off the net and I haven't had a chance to
try it yet.  I include the note from the contributors:

Warning: this recipe is directed at those  who  know what Bhelpuri
tastes like, quantities mentioned are approximate, proportions are
left to the readers, to their taste. Purists will have to go to an
Indian grocery shop. Deviationists  may  use substitutes) The most
important thing is to keep the puffed rice-sev mixture crisp by not
adding the other ingredients to it until serving, and do so on your
plate.
