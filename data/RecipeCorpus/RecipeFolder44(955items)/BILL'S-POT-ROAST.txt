Categories: Meats, Family
Yield: 2 Servings
3 lb Flank or rump roast
-(4 lbs if has a bone)

In large Dutch oven, heat woo sauce, olive oil, salts and pepper. Add
some margarine.  When oil is hot, sear roast quickly on all sides.
Add beef broth and onion soup, plus seasonings to taste.

Reduce heat to medium, a brisk simmer.  (NOT a rolling boil!) Add
wine and cook *covered* 2 hours, or till starts to be tender.

Peel and cut up vegetables, all about the same size slices. Add to
roast. When potatoes are fork tender, remove cloves and serve.

If fluid ever gets lower than half that you started with, add water.

To reheat:  Prepare fresh vegetables.  Cover pot and bring to simmer.
When warm, take meat out, put in vegetables (with meat on top so it's
just steamed); cook 45 minutes. Might want to add soup instead of
water.
