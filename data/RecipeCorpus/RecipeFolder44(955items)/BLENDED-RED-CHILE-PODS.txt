Title: BLENDED RED CHILE PODS
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 1 Servings
8    Chile pods --  whole/dried
(seeded and deveined
2    Garlic clove -- peeled
1 ts Oregano
1 ts Salt
Choose the dried chiles for your dish.  They range in "heat" from
mild to very hot, so ask your merchant to point the way. Prepare the
chiles by slitting or cracking them open and removing the seeds and
veins. The seeds and veins are what makes the chiles hot, so you
should clean the peppers according to how hot you wish them to be.
Place the chile skins in a bowl and add enough hot tap water to
cover. Allow them to sit for 1 hour, then drain, reserving the
liquid. Place the pepper skins in a blender and add enough of the
reserved water to bring the total amount in your machine to 1 pint.
Add the garlic, oregano and salt. Blend until the mixture is thick
and smooth.    This recipe makes 1 pint. By Jeff Smith The Frugal
