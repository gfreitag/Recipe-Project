Title: BLACKENED DRUM
Categories: Wildgame, Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
Drumfish fillets, 1" thick
1 tb Paprika
2 tb Salt
1 ts Onion powder
1 1/2 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Red pepper
1/2 ts Pepper, white
1/2 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Oregano
1 tb Parsley
Mix above dry ingredients in a bowl. Dip the drum fillets in melted
sweet cream butter and sprinkle with the seasoning mixture, then drop
into a very hot cast iron skillet. Cooking time is only 3 - 4 minutes
per side; thinner fillets require less time. (A tablespoon of butter
may be added to the skillet just before the seasoned fish to prevent
sticking.) Also for: Try fillets of flounder, speck, grouper,
amberjack, dolphin. Source: Lousiana Conservationist Mar/Apr 88
