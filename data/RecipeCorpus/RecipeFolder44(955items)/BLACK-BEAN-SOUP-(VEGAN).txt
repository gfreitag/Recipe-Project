Title: BLACK BEAN SOUP (VEGAN)
Categories: Soups, Beans, Prodigy, Dec.
Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Black beans; sorted and rins
6 c  Water
7 c  [stock]
1 cn Tomatoes; including liquid
Cut in pieces
2 c  Chopped celery
1    Carrot; large chopped
1    Onion; large chopped
4    Garlic cloves; large min
2    Bay leaves
1 ts Basil
1 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Marjoram
1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
5 1/2 tb Sherry
Soak the black beans in the 6 cups of water overnight in a large pot.
Drain the soaking water and refill soup pot with the 7 cups of ff
chicken broth(you can also use vegetable broth) the add and cook for
2-2 1/2 hours until beans  are soft the tomatoes, celery, carrot,
onion, garlic, bay leaves, oregano, basil, marjoram then add the
lemon juice, sherry and apple cider vinegar to taste for a sharper
flavor. Salt & pepper to taste. Now I have not tried this yet but I
think that I would add the tomatoes after the beans were soft. Then
remove the bay leaves and blend soup in food processor or blender.
Return to soup pot and reheat and serve garnishing each bowl with
1/2- 1 T of nonfat sour cream & 1/2 teaspoon chives or green onion
tops. Nutrition (per serving): 226 calories, Total Fat 2 g (10% of
