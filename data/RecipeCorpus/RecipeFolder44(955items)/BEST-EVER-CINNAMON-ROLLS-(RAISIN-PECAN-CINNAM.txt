Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
4 1/2 c  Flour
1 pk Dry yeast
1 c  Milk
1/3 c  Butter
1/3 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
3    Eggs
3/4 c  Packed brown sugar
1/4 c  Flour
1 tb Ground cinnamon
1/2 c  Butter
1/2 c  Light raisins
1/2 c  Chopped pecans
1 tb Half-and-half or light cream
Powdered Sugar Glaze
In a large mixer bowl, combine 2 1/4 cups of the flour and the yeast.
In a small saucepan heat the milk, the 1/3 cup butter, the 1/3 cup
sugar, and salt just till warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees) and
butter is almost melted, stirring constantly.  Add to flour mixture.
Add eggs. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds,
scraping sides of bowl constantly.  Beat on high speed for 3 minutes.
Using a wooden spoon, stir in as much of the remaining 2 1/4 to 2 3/4
cups flour as you can. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately soft
dough that is smooth and elastic (3 to 5 minutes total).  Shape into
a ball. Place in a greased bowl, turning once. Cover; let rise in a
warm place till double (about 1 hour). For filling, combine brown
sugar, the 1/4 cup flour, and cinnamon. Cut in remaining butter till
crumbly; set aside. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured
surface. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Roll the dough into a 12"
square. Sprinkle filling over dough square; top with raisins and
pecans. Roll up jelly-roll style; pinch edges to seal. Slice roll
into eight 1 1/2" pieces. Arrange dough pieces, cut side up, in a
greased 12" deep-dish pizza pan or a 13x9x2" baking pan. Cover dough
loosely with clear plastic wrap, leaving room for rolls to rise.
Refrigerate rolls 2 to 24 hours.  Uncover and let stand at room
temperature for 30 minutes (Or, for immediate baking, don't chill
dough. Instead, cover loosely; let dough rise in a warm place till
nearly double, about 45 minutes). Break any surface bubbles with a
greased toothpick. Brush dough with half-and-half or light cream.
Bake in a 375 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or till light brown.
If necessary to prevent overbrowning, cover rolls loosely with foil
the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking. Remove rolls from oven. Brush
again with half-and-half or light cream. Cool for 1 minute. Carefully
invert cinnamon rolls onto a wire rack. Cool slightly. Invert again
onto a serving platter. Drizzle with Powdered Sugar Glaze. Serve
warm. Makes 8 rolls. VARIATION: Apple Cinnamon Rolls: Prepare rolls
as directed, except substitute 1 cup finely chopped apple for the
raisins in the filling. POWDERED SUGAR GLAZE: In a bowl stir together
1 1/4 cups sifted powdered sugar, 1 tsp. corn syrup, 1/2 tsp.
vanilla, and enough half-and-half or light cream (1 to 2 Tbsp.) to
make of drizzling consistency.
