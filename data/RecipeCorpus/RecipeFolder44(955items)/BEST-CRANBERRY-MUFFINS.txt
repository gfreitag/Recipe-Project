Title: BEST CRANBERRY MUFFINS
Categories: Dorcas, Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
1/4 c  Butter
1 1/2 c  Unsifted flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Sugar
1 lg Egg
1/2 c  Milk
1 c  Fresh cranberries
2 tb Sugar
1/4 ts Cinnamon
Stir flour to aerate.  Mix the 2 tablespoons sugar with cinnamon.
Coarsely chop cranberries with knife.

Generously butter a 12 cup muffin pan.

In a small saucepan or skillet, melt butter; set aside to cool.

In a medium mixing bowl, with a fork, thoroughly stir together the
flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.

In a small mixing bowl beat egg enough to combine yolk and white;
beat in milk and melted butter.  Add to flour mixture; stir quickly
and lightly just until flour is almost dampened. Add cranberries;
lightly stir in; do not beat.

Using a large metal spoon, spoon batter into prepared muffin-pan
cups, filling each slightly more than half full. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon
cinnamon-sugar over batter in each cup.

Bake in a preheated 375~ oven until golden brown and a cake tester
inserted in the center comes out clean - 20 to 25 minutes.

If muffins are to be held 10 to 15 minutes before serving, tip them
in the pan to prevent steaming and keep in a warm oven. To reheat
cold muffins, place them in a covered pan or a closed paper bag in a
preheated 350~ oven for 10 minutes.
