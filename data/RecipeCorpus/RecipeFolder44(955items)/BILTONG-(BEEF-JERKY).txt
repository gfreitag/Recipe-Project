As you travel around East Africa you will see countless Africans
selling food along the roadsides, in the markets, or through bus and
train windows. They sell fruit, boiled eggs grilled maize, boiled
maize, yogurt, milk, soda pop, fried dough balls, samosas, yellow
buns, and real seasonal delicacies like roasted mice and termites.
The following are a few East African snack foods you can try.

"Beef Jerky" is more common in South Africa but still a part of the
East African diet.  It is generally made from beef, but other game is
used when available.  Cut strips of meat following the grain of
muscle. Make strips 2 inches wide and 1 inch thick.  Best made during
cool dry weather if possible.

Salt the meat by rubbing the mixture in well and leave in the basin
of salt mixture overnight.  Dip a cloth in vinegar, wring dry and
whip the meat well.

Hang the strips of meat in a cool, dry, well ventilated place until
dry.

You can also hang the meat on an oven rack placed in the top slot of
the oven.  Dry the meat on low heat.
