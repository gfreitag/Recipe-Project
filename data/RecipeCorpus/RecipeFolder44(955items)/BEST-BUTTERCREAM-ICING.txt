Title: BEST BUTTERCREAM ICING
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 10 Servings
1 1/2 lb Crisco
2 1/2 tb Vanilla
1 tb Butter flavoring
Cream together until light and fluffy, then add: 3 lb Confectioner's
sugar Cream and scrape bowl, then add:
12 T  Water 6 T Karo
Do not over-mix or icing will contain air. Does not need to be
refrig- erated. (This is very similar to "Basic Buttercream", which
is also a general purpose icing that is good for decorating and for
making flowers.) Source: newsletter Jan '90 Dolores, Ohio 04/29 07:23
