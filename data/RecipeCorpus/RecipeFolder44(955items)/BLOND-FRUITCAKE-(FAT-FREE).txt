At LAST! I've got the fat free fruitcake recipe. This is SO good. You
won't believe your taste buds.

Now, my grandmother brought me a regular loaf-shaped loaf - meatloaf
sized. She said it made several that size. I'll have to ask her if
she cooked it a different amount of time and if she really let it sit
for a month before digging in. I don't think I could wait that long!
