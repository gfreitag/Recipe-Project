Title: BETTER-THAN-SALT HERB BLEND
Categories: Seasonings, Herb/spice
Yield: 1 Servings
3    Bay leaves -- finely
Chopped
4 tb Oregano
4 tb Onion powder
4 ts Marjoram
4 ts Basil leaves
4 ts Winter savory -- ground
4 ts Garlic powder
2 ts Rosemary leaves --
1 ts Sage
1 ts Thyme
1 ts Black pepper -- ground
1 tb Lemon zest -- dried
The recipe is for dried herbs. If you have your own herb garden, do
try drying your own. They will dry in seconds in a microwave, or in a
longer time in a warm oven (about 180 degrees). Leave the oven door
slilghtly ajar to allow moisture escape.

Unless you have not time and patience that I have, buy the onion and
garlic powders. I have tried chopping my own fresh garlic and onion,
but they take too long to dry for me.

Mix and crush to a coarse powder with a mortar and pestle or a small
blender or food processor.

The Herb Blend is delicious on slald greens, on sliced tomatoes and
cucumbers, on fish, hamburgers, meat loaves, steaks, omelets, etc. Try
mixing the Herb Blend with a stick of butter or margarine. Let stand
in refrigerator for a day of two for good flavor. Use Herbed butter on
vegetables, breads, meats, fish, etc.
