Title: BLACKENING RUB
Categories: Sauces, Cajun, Hot
Yield: 1 Servings
1 tb Salt
1 tb +2 ts White Pepper
1 tb +3/4 ts Black Pepper
2 1/2 ts Dry mustard
2 1/2 ts Garlic Powder
1/2 ts Thyme leaves (dried)
1/4 lb Butter
2 1/2 ts Cayenne Pepper (to taste)
Use unsalted butter, melt over low heat.  Heat a cast iron pan to just
before melting over high heat. Should take 5 to 8 minutes. If you
think you are going to ruin the pan, the heat is just about right.
Make sure the meat, poultry or fish is at room temp. and dry. Thin
cuts do not work well. Dip the meat, poultry or fish into the melted
butter and apply an even amount of rub to each side.  Put into pan
and leave alone for a minute or so then check the underside of the
meat for a nice dark crust. Adjust as needed.  By this time you will
know if your smoke detectors are working and if you should of done
this outside. Turn the meat and repeat till the desired doneness is
achieved. The trouble is well worth it, the taste is, in a word,
fantastic!  You can add more or less cayenne pepper to your taste,
I've found more is usually better.
