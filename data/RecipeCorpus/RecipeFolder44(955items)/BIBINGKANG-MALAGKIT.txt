Yield: 16 Servings
4    14-ounce cans coconut milk
2 1/2 c  Glutinous rice
1/2 c  Long grain rice

2 c  Brown sugar, packed
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Ground peanuts or pilli
-nuts, optional
3    Eggs beaten
While wading through my pile of newspaper clippings I ran across the
following gem.  I can't help but think that it might be even better
if you used palm sugar instead of the brown sugar. Never heard of
"pilli" nuts++any idea what they are?

Open cans of coconut milk without shaking.  Spoon off thick milk that
has risen to top and measure 2 cups. Measure 4 cups remaining thinner
milk. Freeze any unused coconut milk.

Mix glutinous and long-grain rice in a bowl.  Cover with hot water
and let stand for 5 minutes.  Drain rice and turn into a heavy
4-quart saucepan. Mix thin coconut milk, granulated sugar and salt
with rice.

Bring to boil, reduce heat to very low and cook, covered until rice is
tender but not soft, about 30 minutes. Turn rice into well-greased
13- by 9-inch baking pan, flatten rice and smooth top; set aside.

Mix thick coconut milk and brown sugar in a saucepan. Add vanilla and
nuts. Cook and stir until sugar dissolves and syrup thickens, about 5
minutes. Gradually stir some of the hot mixture into eggs, then
return to saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly
thickened, about 1 minute. Pour topping evenly over rice.

Bake in a 375F oven for 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool to room
temperature.  Cut into squares to serve.

Serves 16 to 20.
