Title: BISCOCHITOS- A CUT OUT SUGAR COOKIE
Categories: Biscuits
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Margarine or butter
3 tb Sweet sherry
1    Egg
3 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
2 ts Anise seed crushed
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Mix sugar and margarine, sherry and egg in a
large bowl. Stir in the remaining ingredients except the 1/4 cup
sugar and the cinnamon. Divide dough into two balls. Roll out each
ball to 1/4 inch thick and cut into any shape with cookie cutters.
Place on ungreased sheet. Mix together the sugar and cinnamon and
sprinkle on the cookies before baking. Bake 10-12 minutes until
golden.

These cookies are cute made into a cactus shape. Pinch off balls of
dough, one larger than a quarter and 2 the size of a nickel. Roll
each of the balls between your palms to make cigar shape. Flatten the
large one to make the main stem of the cactus. Bend one third of each
of the two smaller ones to make a J shape and attach them at uneven
intervals on each side to make the "arms". Flatten them to match the
trunk and bake.

Let you daughter taste the anise first.  Often children do not like
it as much as adults.  If your daughter does not like the anise
flavor simply substitute cinnamon oil or flavoring.  It is very
popular in Mexico.
