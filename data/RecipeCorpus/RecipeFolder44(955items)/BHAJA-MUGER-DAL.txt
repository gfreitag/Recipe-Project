Place mung beans on ungreased griddle or in a skillet over medium to
medium-low heat.  Stirring often, roast the dal for 8 to 10 minutes.
The dal will acquire a lighter colour & emit a nutty aroma. Be
careful that they do not turn a dark brown.  Transfer to a bowl &
wash if desired.

Bring water to a boil & stir in the dal along with the turmeric &
whole chiles.  Simmer, covered, until the dal is tender, 35 to 45
minutes. While cooking, uncover & stir occasionally. Add salt, sugar,
cumin & coriander. Keep warm.

Heat oil in a skillet.  Add bay leaf & kalonji & fry for a few
seconds. Add ginger & minced green chile & fry until the ginger is
lightly browned which should be no more than 2 minutes. Stir
constantly. Pour into the dal & mix well.  Simmer for a further
couple of minutes & remove from heat. Blend in the garam masala,
lemon or lime juice & ghee if desired. Cover & let stand to let the
flavours develop. Garnish & serve.
