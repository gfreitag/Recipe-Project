Title: BLACK BEAN STEW
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Brown rice
1 c  Water
2 c  Cooked black beans,
-reserving some of the
-cooking liquid
1 sm Onion, chopped
2    Cloves crushed garlic
1/2 ts Cumin
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Basil
1/2 ts Ginger
1    Bay leaf
1/4 ts Red pepper (optional)
1/4 c  Cheap red wine (optional)
1    Vegetarian sausage link,
-crumbled (optional)
Salt and pepper
4 oz Shredded sharp
-cheddar cheese
Prepare the rice in the water according to package directions or your
own procedure (white rice is OK, but it makes for a bland and fairly
gummy dish).

While the rice is cooking, combine all the rest of the ingredients
except the cheese in a saucepan and simmer, at least 15 minutes.

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spoon the cooked rice into a casserole dish.
Remove the bay leaf from the bean mixture; pour the beans over the
rice and stir; it doesn't have to be thoroughly mixed. Top with the
cheese and bake uncovered 20-35 minutes or until cheese is browned
and bubbly. Let stand five minutes before serving.

I tell people this serves four, but that's a fairly skimpy serving. It
doubles easily, but you'll need a pretty good-size casserole. Also,
the wine is optional for those who don't use it, but it really does
make a difference, and since the other flavors are pretty assertive,
I'd suggest using a fairly cheap, strongly flavored wine. Posted By
