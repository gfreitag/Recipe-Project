Categories: Chinese, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Oyster sauce
2 tb Chicken stock
1 tb Shao Hsing wine, or dry
-sherry
1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Sesame oil
1    To 1 1/2 pounds gai lan
-(Chinese broccoli)
1 ts Salt

Gai lan is Chinese broccoli.  It's not much like the Western stuff.
It has thinner stems, flowers and leaves and is eaten more as a green.

Combine the oyster sauce, chicken stock, Shao Hsing wine, sugar and
sesame oil in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil and cook until sauce
thickens. Set aside.

Wash the gai lan in cold water.  Trim off and discard the tough
bottoms. Peel stalks if they are thick and tough; leave gai lan whole
or cut into thirds.

Bring 3 to 4 quarts of water to a boil in a wok or stock pot; add the
salt and oil.  Add the greens, bring back to a second boil. Turn off
the heat and let greens stand for a minute or two. When the green
stalks brighten, test one for doneness.  It should be tender and
crisp. Drain immediately and shake off excess water.

Transfer to a platter, pour dressing over, and serve immediately.

Serves 4 to 6.
