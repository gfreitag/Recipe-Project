Title: BLANQUETTE OF VEAL & CAULIFLOWER
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Boneless veal stew meat
1 md Onion, cut in half
2    Celery stalks; cut in half
1 md Carrot; cut in half
6 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 ts Salt; or as desired
1/2 ts Whole black peppercorns
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
1/2    Lemon
5 tb Unsalted butter
5 tb All-purpose flour
2 1/2 c  Cauliflower florets
3/4 c  Sour cream
COMBINE THE VEAL AND 4 CUPS broth in a 5-quart heavy pot over high
heat on top of the stove. Cover and bring to a boil. Remove any scum
that comes to the top of the pot, then add the remaining 2 cups
broth, the onion, celery, carrot, salt, pepper, nutmeg and lemon.
Reduce heat to low and let simmer for 1 1/4 hours, or until meat is
just tender. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium pot over low
heat, and whisk in the flour. Cook, stirring, 2 minutes and remove
from heat. Set aside until the meat is cooked. When the meat is done,
remove it from the liquid, using a slotted spoon. Pick off and
discard any vegetables that cling to the veal. Replace the
butter-flour mixture over medium-low heat on the stove and strain the
cooking liquid into it, whisking vigorously. Discard vegetables in
the strainer. Cook, stirring, until mixture thickens, about 3 to 5
minutes. Add cauliflower and continue to cook an additional 15
minutes. Skim off any residue that rises to the surface. When it's
time to serve dinner, add the veal to the cauliflower and sauce and
heat through. Place sour cream in a mixing bowl, whisk in 1/2 cup of
the hot sauce, then add this to the stew. Do not reheat the sauce
after adding sour cream. Pour the stew into a serving dish and
accompany with rice pilaf or buttered noodles.
