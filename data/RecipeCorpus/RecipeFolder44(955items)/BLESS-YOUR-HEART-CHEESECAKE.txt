=======================================================
============== === In a small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over milk;
set aside to soften, about 5 minutes. Place saucepan over very low
heat; cook, stirring constantly until gelatin is completely
dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes; remove from heat; cool slightly. In food
processor fitted with metal blade or in blender, process cottage
cheese, sugar, orange peel and salt until smooth. With processor
running, slowly add gelatin mixture. Spoon mixture into a 9-inch (6
1/2-cup) heart-shaped baking pan or an 8 x 1 1/2-inch round baking
pan. In a small bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs and butter;
sprinkle over cheesecake mixture. Cover and refrigerate until firm, 2
to 3 hours. To unmold, using a metal spatula or knife, loosen edge
around pan; quickly dip into warm water; unmold onto a serving
platter. Arrange strawberries and raspberries in rows across
cheesecake. In a small saucepan, heat raspberry preserves and water
until melted; brush over berries. Refrigerate until preserves are
cold, about 30 minutes. (If a round pan is used, arrange berries to
resemble a heart.)
