Categories: Cheese, Main dish, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
10 oz Wholewheat spaghetti (to 12)

10 oz Home-made noodles

-- very finely chopped
2 tb Sesame or walnut oil

Cook pasta in plenty of boiling, salted water until 'al dente.' Drain

immediately.

Note: Personally, I think the walnut oil goes better with this.
