Title: BITTERSWEET TEMPTATION
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 2 Servings
175 g  Crme fraiche
1 tb Orange marmalade
Whisky (optional)
Icing sugar
The unusual flavour of orange marmalade balances the fresh creaminess
of crme fraiche, heightened if you like with a little whisky. The
dessert is frozen lightly just before serving - and it is temptation
indeed.

Whisk the crme fraiche and stir in the marmalade. Lace with a little
whisky, to taste, if desired. Put into two little dishes and freeze
lightly - about 1 hour. Sprinkle with a little icing sugar before
serving.
