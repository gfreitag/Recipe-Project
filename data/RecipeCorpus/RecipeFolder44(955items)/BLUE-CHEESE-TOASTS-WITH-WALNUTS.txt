Title: BLUE CHEESE TOASTS WITH WALNUTS
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
6 oz Roquefort
-=OR=- other blue cheese
6 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Cognac (optional)
Freshly ground pepper
2 tb Finely chopped walnuts
4 sl Bread (thin)
Serve these Blue Cheese Toasts surrounding a salad made of finely
shredded bitter greens--radicchio, butter lettuce, endive--and
dressed with a walnut oil vinaigrette. PREHEAT THE OVEN OR BROILER
for the toast. Cream the cheese and butter together. Add the cognac,
if using, season with pepper and stir in the walnuts. Toast the bread
lightly on both sides. Spread the cheese over the toast, then return
it to the oven or broiler just long enough for the butter and cheese
to melt into the toast a little. It shouldn't melt completely, but
just soften. Remove the toasts from the oven, dust them with more
pepper and cut them into smaller pieces. Serve warm. Cool, juicy
slices of pears would make a perfect accompaniment to the cheese and
walnuts.
