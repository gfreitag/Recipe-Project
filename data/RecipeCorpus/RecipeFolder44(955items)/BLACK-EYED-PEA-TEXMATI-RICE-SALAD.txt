Chef's Notes:  It is an old Southern tradition that black eyed peas,
when eaten on New Year's Day, will bring luck for the new year. This
recipe was presented by Chef Fearing on his weekly cooking segment,
"Dean's Cuisine" on KDFW-TV in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. Dean
Fearing is the Executive Chef of The Mansion on Turtle Creek in
