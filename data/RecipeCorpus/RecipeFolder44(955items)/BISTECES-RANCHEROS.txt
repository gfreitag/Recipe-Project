Cut the steak into fingers 1 X 1 X 3-inches.  In a plastic bag,
combine the steak with the garlic and oil. Close tightly and turn to
coat the meat well. Marinate at room temperature for 1 to 1 1/2
hours. Grill the steak 3 to 4 inches above the hot coals, turning to
brown evenly. Meat should be rare to medium-rare. This takes 10 to 12
minutes total cooking time. Meanwhile, wrap the tortillas in a clean
kitchen towel and heat in a 325 Degree F. oven.  As the meat comes
off the fire, place a strip of steak and a strip of chile in each
tortilla and roll up. Serve with Santa Maria Salsa.  Two of these fat
tortilla sandwiches make a nice portion, served with refried beans or
beans and rice.
