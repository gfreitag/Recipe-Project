Anne's note: The original recipe measures the dry ingredients by
weight; these are the most accurate measures (I converted it to
volume measures).

Sift the chick pea flour. Heat oil in a heavy, 10-12" frying pan, wok
or saute pan over a medium flame. Put in the sifted chick pea flour.
Stir and fry 2 to 3 minutes until the flour turns a shade darker and
is cooked (it should taste fried, not raw). Put the flour into a
large bowl, stir at once and allow to cool.

Make a syrup with 1 cup/8 fl oz/1/4 litre water and the 14 oz/1 1/3
c/395 g. sugar by bringing the water-sugar combination to a boil and
then simmering very gently for about 20 minutes or until the syrup
reaches a one thread consistency. (To test this, dip in a wooden
spoon and let coat slightly. Pinch some syrup off the back of the
spoon with two fingers and then try separating the fingers. One
sticky thread should form. This is the Indian method. If you have a
better one, use it.)

Pour the hot syrup in the cooled chick pea flour/gram flour mixture.
add the ground cardamom seeds and the nuts and mix well. keep
stirring until mixture begins to harden slightly. (It should still be
pourable.) Pour into a 9 inch square cake tin, tilt tin so barfee
mixture flows to the edges and allow to cool. Cut into 3/4 inch
cubes. besan barfee if tightly wrapped in aluminium foil and then
placed in a plastic container, freezes very well.
