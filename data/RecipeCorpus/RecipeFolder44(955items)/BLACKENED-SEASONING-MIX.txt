Title: BLACKENED SEASONING MIX
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 1 Servings
1 tb Paprika
2 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Onion powder
1 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Cayenne
3/4 ts White pepper
3/4 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Oregano
Mix all and store in a glass jar. NOTES : Usually blackened seasoning
for steak has fennel seed in it which really gives the meat a great
taste. You can make your own which is alot less expensive or you can
buy Paul Prudhomme's Blackened Steak Magic seasoning. We have it at
the local market in the seasoning section. Lexi Kern (NYJT28A)
