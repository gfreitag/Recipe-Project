Pound chicken until twice its normal width, rip into 1x2 inch pieces.

In a large frying pan, saute diced onions in the butter/oil until

chicken is not quite done.  Add cream of celery soup and 1/2 can of

Add Fontina cheese and allow to melt, mixing well. Let simmer until

Enjoy, this has a really nice flavor to it, the chicken boulon in the
rice marries the tastes of the main sauce beautifully and the Fontina
cheese adds the extra body to the chicken.
