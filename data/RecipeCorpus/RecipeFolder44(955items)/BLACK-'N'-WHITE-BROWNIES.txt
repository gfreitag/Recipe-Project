Title: BLACK 'N' WHITE BROWNIES
Categories: Desserts, Diabetic, Low-fat/cal
Yield: 32 Servings
1 c  Cake flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Shortening, softened
1/2 c  Granulated sugar replacement
2    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 tb Water
1/4 c  Unsweetened coconut, grated
1 ts Coconut milk
1 oz Baking chocolate, melted
These brownies are mailable.

Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Cream shortening and
sugar replacement until light and fluffy. (My note: be sure to use a
sugar replacement that does not lose sweetness when heated -
Aspertame is not suitable.)

Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in
vanilla extract and water.

Divide batter into two equal parts.  To one part add unsweetened
coconut and coconut milk.  Stir to completely blend. To the remaining
half, beat in the melted chocolate.

Spread coconut mixture on bottom of well-greased 8-in square pan.
Spread chocolate layer on top of coconut layer. Bake at 350 F for 25
to 30 min. Cut into 1 x 2 inch bars.
