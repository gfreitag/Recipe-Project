Prepare Walnut Streusel:  Mix 1/2 cup of finely chopped walnuts, 1/2

Beat egg lightly with milk and vanilla; stir into berry mixture just
until combined. Spread half the batter in streusel-lined pan;
sprinkle with remaining streusel, then with remaining batter. Bake in
a 350 degree oven until a pick inserted in center comes out clean (45
to 60 minutes). Let cool in pan for 20 minutes, then remove pan
sides. Dust with powdered sugar. Serve warm or cool.
