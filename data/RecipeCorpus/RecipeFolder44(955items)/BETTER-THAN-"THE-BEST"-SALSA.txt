Red peppers make a prettier sauce, but green is ok.  I like the
flavor of the red ones.  Get sweet onions like Vidalia or Texas 1020
if you can.

Cook tomatoes and vinegarfor an hour in a large[!] pot. Add remaining
ingredients except cilantro and cook another a to 2 hours 'til a
consistency you like. Add cilantro. Put in hot pint jars and process
in water bath 15 minutes.

Makes about 10 pints
