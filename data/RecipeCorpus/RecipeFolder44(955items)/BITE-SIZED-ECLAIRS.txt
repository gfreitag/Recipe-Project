For filling:  Mix dry pudding and milk and chill for one hour. Beat
whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla 'til stiff. Fold into
pudding mix. Refrigerate several hours.

For Cream puffs:  Bring water, salt and butter to boil over medium
heat. Remove and add flour.  Mix well. Return to low heat, stirring
constantly, until mixture pulls away from side of pan and forms a
ball. Beat in eggs one at a time 'til well mixed.  Drop dough from
teaspoons onto greased cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 30
minutes. Puffs will look "dry" when done. For Topping: Mix all
ingredients in a double boiler until chocolate melts. Keep warm.
Slice through puffs horizontally and add about a tablespoon of
filling. Take remaining cap and drag through topping. Place on filled
puff.  Must be refrigerated before serving. Best if made same day as
needed - otherwise they get soggy.
