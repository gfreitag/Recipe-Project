This is as close to the world famous Ebinger's Blackout Cake as you
will get.  This recipe was developed by Ceri E. Hadda - a
professional baker and food writer.

Preheat oven to 350F.

Make the cake.  Butter two 9-inch cake pans; dust them with flour and
tap out the excess.  Set aside. Stir the cocoa with some of the milk
to form a pasate. Stir in the rest of the milk, and beat with a whisk
until the mixture is smooth. Set aside.

In the bowl of an electric mixer combine the butter, shortening,
sugar, eggs, and vanilla; beat for 1 minute, or until the mixture is
fluffy.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the
mixture, alternately with the cocoa mixture, to the contents of the
bowl, beating between additions. Begin and end with the flour
mixture, and beat only until the dry ingredients are absorbed. Divide
the batter between the cake pans and smooth the tops with a spatula
to even them.
