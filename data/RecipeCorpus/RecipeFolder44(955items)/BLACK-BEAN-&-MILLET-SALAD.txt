Cook the millet in 3 cups of water until all water is absorbed, 30-45
minutes.  Fluff with a fork and allow to cool slightly. In a very
large bowl, combine millet, black beans, tomatoes, and onion. Peel
several strips from the cucumber (it should look striped) and cut it
lengthwise into four pieces.  Remove the seedy part from the pieces
and cut them into 1/2 inch slices. Add the cucumber to the salad. Mix
all dressing ingredients until well-blended.  Pour over the salad and
toss to blend. Cover and refrigerate until the salad is very well
chilled. Serve on lettuce leaves or stuff into pita breads.
