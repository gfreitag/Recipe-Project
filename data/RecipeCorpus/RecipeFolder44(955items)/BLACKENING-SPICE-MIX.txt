Categories: Prodigy, Cajun
Yield: 1 /4 cup
1 tb Paprika
2 1/2 ts Salt

If you do not have the facilities to blacken the fish outdoors,
preferably on a butane crab boiler, merely melt some butter, dredge
your fish, chicken or meat with the above and saute in butter in your
kitchen. You will not get your pan white hot as you must do outdoors,
but it will be tasty. This process is called "Bronzing". When you
blacken, you must get a heavy black iron skillet white hot so that
when you put the butter in and the fish, it chars and takes only a
minute or 2 on each side. This produces tons of smoke. I did it in my
house to see what would happen and my neighbors thought my house was
on fire. You MUST have a strong commercial exhause like restaurants
have to do this in your kitchen.
