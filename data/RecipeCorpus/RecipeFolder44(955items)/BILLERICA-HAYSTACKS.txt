brown the meat over high heat and transfer when done to the kettle.
Add chili powder and cumin and cook the mixture, stirring, for about
a minute. Add tomatoes, broth, bay leaf, cayenne, Tabasco, oregano,
salt and pepper and bring to a boil.  Lower heat and allow to simmer
slowly for 2 hours. Or, put chili into slow cooker for several hours.
Stir in the chocolate and cinnamon and adjust seasonings. Place bowls
of each of the above accompaniments on the table so diners can
prepare their own Haystacks. A layer of Fritos is placed on the plate
or bowl first; then some chili, and whichever accompaniments appeal
to the diner. May be topped with sour cream. From: Mary Riemerman
