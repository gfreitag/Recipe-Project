Categories: Swedish, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Butter
2 tb Onions; finely chopped
1 lb Ground beef; lean
4    Egg yolks
1 tb Capers; drained & finely
-chopped
1 1/2 ts Salt
Fresh ground pepper
1 ts White vinegar
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/4 c  Beets; fresh cooked/canned,
-drained & finely chopped
2 tb Butter
2 tb Vegetable oil
4    Fried eggs (opt)
In a small pan, melt the 1 tablespoon of butter. When the foam
subsides, add the onions and cook for 2 or 3 minutes or until they
are soft and transparent, but not brown. Scrape into a large bowl and
add the meat, egg yolks, capers, salt, pepper and white vinegar. Mix
together and moisten with the heavy cream. Then stir in the drained
chopped beets. Shape the mixture into 12-14 round partties, about 2-3
inches in diameter. In a heavy large skillet, heat the butter and
oil. When the foam subsides, add the patties 3 or 4 at a time and
cook over moderately high heat for 5 to 6 minutes on each side or
until they are a deep brown. In Sweden, these spicy hamburgers are
frequently served with a fried egg set atop each, in which case they
are made larger and thicker.
