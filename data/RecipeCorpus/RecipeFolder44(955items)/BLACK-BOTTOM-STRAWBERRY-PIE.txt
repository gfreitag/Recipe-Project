CRUST:  Lightly grease 9-inch pie plate.  Process cookies and brown
sugar in a food processor until finely crushed and blended. Add
butter and pulse just until crumbs are moistened. Press evenly and
firmly over bottom and sides of pie plate.  Place in freezer to firm
up crust.

CHOCOLATE LAYER:  Heat heavy cream in a small saucepan (or microwave)
just until steaming hot.  Remove from heat and add chocolate chips.
Let stand 1 to 2 minutes, then stir until chocolate melts and mixture
is thick and well blended.  Spread evenly over bottom of pie crust.
Refrigerate (or freeze) to firm up chocolate.

GLAZE AND FILLING:  Mix sugar and cornstarch in a medium saucepan.
Stir in water, jam and lemon juice. Add 1 cup berries (save prettiest
ones for top of pie) and mash in the saucepan with a potato masher.
Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, whisking constantly. Boil 6
to 7 minutes, whisking occasionly, until mixture is thick and syrupy.
Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
Meanwhile drain remaining berries, hulled side down, on paper
towels. Pat dry.  Pour about 1/3 of the glaze over the chocolate
layer. Spread with a pastry brush to cover. Top with strawberries,
points up. Pour remaining glaze over berries, using a brush to coat
each berry. Refrigerate at least 1 hour to set glaze.
