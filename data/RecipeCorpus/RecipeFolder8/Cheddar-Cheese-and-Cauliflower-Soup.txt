NOTE:  For a milder, sweeter tasting soup, substitute 8 ounces Swiss cheese
for the cheddar cheese.

Heat the butter in a large saucepan.  Add the carrots, celery, and onion;
saute for about 5 minutes until the vegetables are softened. Add the flour
and cook over low heat until the flower is incorporated into the butter,
about 1 minute.

Stirring constantly, gradually add stock and then the cauliflower. Bring to
a boil and simmer until the cauliflower is tender, or about 5 minutes. Stir
in the grated cheese and cook for about 30 seconds until melted. (Do not
bring soup to a boil after cheese is added or the soup will break.) Stir in
the half-and-half; warm the soup over low heat. Season with cayenne pepper
and 1 teaspoon salt or to taste.

To serve, ladle the soup into warm soup bowls.  Sprinkle each portion with
the diced cheese and serve immediately.

Makes 4 seervings.
