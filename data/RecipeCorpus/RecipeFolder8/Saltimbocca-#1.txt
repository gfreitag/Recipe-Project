Title: Saltimbocca #1
Categories: Italian, Meats, Veal
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb Butter
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
1/2 c  Dry white wine
2 lb Veal scallopine, each
Piece about 5" square
1 ts Dried sage
1/4 lb Thin slices of prosciutto
Sprinkle veal slices with sage.  Cover each slice with a slice of
prosciutto and trim this to the same size as the meat.  (Reserve trimmings
for sauces.)  Pin prosciutto slices to the veal slices with toothpicks.
Heat the butter in a large frying pan.  Add meat in one layer and cook for
2 to 3 minutes.  Turn with a pancake turner and cook until golden on both
sides.  Season to taste.  Place the slices of meat, ham side up, on a
heated serving platter and remove the picks. Keep meat warm. Add the wine
to pan, scrape the brown bits from the bottom, and bring quickly to the
boiling point. Pour the sauce over the meat and serve immediately. 4 to 6
servings.
