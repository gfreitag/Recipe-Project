Title: Broccoli Cheese Soup
Categories: Soups/stews, Vegetables, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Cubed Velveeta cheese
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Half-and-half
2    Chicken bouillon cubes
1 c  Water
1    (10-ounce)package frozen
-chopped broccoli
2 c  Milk
In large saucepan, cook broccoli in 1 cup water; do not drain.  Put milk,
cheese, and flour into blender; cover and blend until smooth. Add
half-and-half and bouillon cubes.  Cook, stirring, over medium heat until
hot and mixture thickens.  Mixture will thicken more upon sitting.

Makes 6 cups.

NOTE:  I like to cut down a bit on the richness this soup has by using 2%
milk; and Velveeta "Light" cheese.  Keep stirring-as it may burn. Do not
cook for more than 25 minutes as it becomes a great cheese sauce after a
while-good for pouring over potatoes-but not good if you want soup.
