Slice lemon grass stalk thinly crosswise.  Peel and halve cucumbers
lengthwise, then seed and slice thin crosswise.

Relish:  Bring lemon grass, vinegar, sugar, red pepper flakes and 1/2 cup
water to boil in a saucepan; simmer until reduced to 1/2 cup. Strain
mixture into a bowl and cool slightly; discard solids.  Stir in all other
sauce ingredients.

Sprinkle scallops with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper.
Heat one tablespoon oil in a wok or non-stick skillet.  Working in batches
to avoid overcrowding, and adding remaining oil as needed, saute scallops,
turning once, until seared.

Spoon a portion of relish onto each plate.  Arrange a portion of scallops
over the relish and serve immediately.
