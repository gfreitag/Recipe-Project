Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 36 servings
----------------------------SPINACH-FETA FILLING----------------------------
2 tb Parmesan cheese, freshly
--grated
2 tb Dill; fresh, chopped
1 tb Lemon juice
Salt & pepper, to taste
2 lg Egg whites
1 1/4 lb Spinach; fresh, stemmed and
--washed
1 tb Olive oil
3 bn Scallions, trimmed and

1/4 c  Feta cheese; crumbled
-------------------------------PHYLLO PASTRY-------------------------------
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Poppy or sesame seeds, or a
--combination
8    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18")
1 lg Egg white
2 tb Olive oil
To make filling: Put spinach with water still clinging to the leaves in
a large pot. Cover and cook over medium heat until the spinach is wilted,
about 5 minutes. Drain and refresh with cold water. Squeeze the spinach
quite dry and chop. In nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add
scallions and saute until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a
medium-sized bowl and stir in spinach, feta, Parmesan, dill and lemon
juice. Season with salt and pepper. Beat egg whites lightly with a fork and
stir into the spinach mixture.

To form phyllo rolls: Set oven rack on the upper level; preheat to 350
degrees F. Coat a baking sheet lightly with nonstick cooking spray or line
with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together egg white, oil and
salt. Lay one sheet of phyllo on a work surface with a short side toward
you. Brush lower half of the sheet with the egg-white mixture. Repeat this
step with a second sheet of phyllo and set on top of the first. Spoon
one-quarter of the spinach filling along one long edge. Tuck in the side
edges and roll up, jelly-roll fashion. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
Repeat with the remaining phyllo, egg-white mixture and filling, making 4
rolls in all. Brush tops of the rolls lightly with the egg-mixture and
sprinkle with seeds, if desired. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. With a serrated
knife, cut each roll diagonally into 9 pieces and serve hot.

The rolls may be prepared, baked and sliced up to 2 days in advance. Reheat
in a 350 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until heated through. Makes
36 appetizers.

make for a crowd."
