Title: Mom's Sweet and Sour Meatballs
Categories: Beef, Appetizers, Ground beef
Yield: 6 servings
Bread Crumbs
2 lb Ground Beef
1    Egg
Mix together and form little meat balls, using enough bread crumbs to hold

Dice 1 onion into a frying pan.  Drop balls in to brown all over.

In a pot, put 2 cans whole cranberry sauce, 2 cans strained cranberry
sauce, and 2 cans tomato paste.  Let it all dissolve and cook or simmer on
low light.  Wash cans out with very little water into pot.

As meatballs brown, drop into sauce mixture with a slotted spoon.  When all
meatballs are in sauce, let simmer without lit till it cooks down.   Don't
let bottom scorch.  Serve over rice or challah.
