Title: Smoked Turkey Calzones
Categories: Appetizers, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
4 oz Refrigerated Pizza dough
6 oz Smoked turkey, thin slice
1    Tomato, med.,8 slices
2 c  Frozen chopped spinach
1/2 c  Part-skim ricotta cheese
1 tb Parmesan cheese, grated
1/4 ts Garlic powder
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Spray baking sheet with non-stick spray.
Thaw spinach, squeeze dry. Combine spinach, ricotta, parmesan cheese and
garlic. Divide dough into 4 pieces, roll each to 6" circle. (I probably
would make up my own dough if I had time but the pre-prepared isn't bad.)
Spread spinach mix to within 1/4" of edges of each circle.  Place 1 1/2 oz
turkey and 2 tomato slices one on half of circle.  Fold over and seal by
pressing edges with fork. Place on prepared baking sheet, bake 12-15
minutes, until browned. Can be frozen and re-heated for lunches. Per each:
