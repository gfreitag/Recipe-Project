*DIRECTIONS*

Sprinkle 1/2 cup almonds on bottom of greased 10-inch tube pan. Set aside
rest of almonds and chocolate chips.  Place remaining ingredients in mixer
bowl.  Beat 4 minutes.  Fold in chips and almonds, then pour into pan. Bake
in 350 F oven 60 to 70 minutes. Cool 15 minutes and remove from pan. Serve
with topping of whipped cream if desired.

Note from me:  A nice touch would be to puncture finished cake with
long-tined fork.  Dribble over cake about 1/4 cup Kahlua.  Then serve with
sweetened whipped cream flavored with almond or vanilla extract.
