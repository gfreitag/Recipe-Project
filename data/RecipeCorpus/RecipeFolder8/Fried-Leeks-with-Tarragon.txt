Title: Fried Leeks with Tarragon
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Tarragon
Flour; for dredging
Oil for frying
-canola, lt. olive or peanut
Tarragon vinegar
4    Leeks, about 1-in thick,
-white parts only
1    Egg
Salt & freshly ground pepper
1 ts Finely chopped parsley
TRIM THE LEEKS: Cut off the roots but leave enough so that the leaves
remain joined at the base. Slice them in half lengthwise down to the base
but not through it, and rinse them well. Steam them over boiling water
until they are tender when pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes, then set
on a towel to cool and drain dry. Beat the egg on a plate and season with
salt and pepper. Add the parsley and half the tarragon. Dip the leeks into
the egg and slosh them around so that they are well covered, then dip them
in flour to coat. Heat enough oil in a heavy pan to cover the bottom
generously. When it is hot enough to sizzle a drop of water, add the leeks.
Fry them, turning them frequently until they're nicely browned all over.
Set them on a towel to drain briefly. Serve with the remaining tarragon
sprinkled over the top and a cruet of vinegar on the side.
