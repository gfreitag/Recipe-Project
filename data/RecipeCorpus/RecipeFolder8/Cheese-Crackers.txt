Title: Cheese Crackers
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 servings
pn Paprika
pn Cayenne pepper
2 tb Water
1/2 c  Grated sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 c  Flour, part for rolling
2 tb Margarine or butter
1/4 ts Salt
Mix all together in a bowl.  Original directions suggested shaping into a
roll 1 1/2 inch wide, chilling at least 2 hours wrapped in wax paper and
cutting in thin slices to make 1 dozen or more crackers.  This would
produce neatly shaped crackers, possibly thicker than desired.

By rolling very thin, this amount of dough will make small crackers about
1/2 inch apart to cover 1 1/2 small cookie sheets.  They do puff up while
baking.  May be cut quickly in random small shapes with a plastic knife.

Suggested toppings coarse salt (made them too salty), garlic salt, celery
salt, curry powder, or freshly ground black pepper.  If the dough is very
dry after rolling, brush tops with water before salting.  If it is soft,
sprinkle lightly and press the salt into the crackers.

Bake 5 minutes at 425 F or until browned.
