Butter Dips

~ Remove from oven when melted.  While melting make the following:

2 1/4 cups flour 1 Tbls sugar 3 tsp baking powder 1 1/2 tsp salt (I cut
this to 1/2 tsp as I am cutting down on salt) 1 cup milk

Blend dry ingredients, add milk, turn onto well floured board, knead
lightly. Roll out on floured board to 12x8" rectangle. Cut dough in half
lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 16 (or so 3/4") strips. Dip each strip
in melted butter, turn and dip again and lay in pan. To do this I put the
pan at an angle, dip and put strips at top.

Bake 15-20 min at 450.

Variations:

1. Add 1/2 cup grated cheese to mixture.

2. Sprinkle paprike, celery salt or garlic powder over dips before baking.

3. Add 1/4 cxup minced chives or parsley to mixture.
