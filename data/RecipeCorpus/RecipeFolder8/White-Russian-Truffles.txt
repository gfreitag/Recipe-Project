Title: White Russian Truffles
Categories: Candies, Chocolate
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Kahlua
1 3/4 lb Milk chocolate, divided
1 c  Whipping cream
1.   Chop finely 1 lb of the chocolate.  Melt in a double boiler to 120
degrees.  Measure the cream into a 3-quart saucepan and bring just to the
boil.  Remove from the heat and cool to 120 degrees.  Add the chocolate to
the cooled cream and stir until the mixture is smooth.

2.   Stir the Kahlua into the chocolate, mixing well.  scrape onto a baking
sheet and refrigerate until firm.

3.   Finely grate the remaining 3/4 lb of the chocolate.  (This is easiest
to do using the grater blade of a food processor.) Remove the filling from
refrigeration and form into small rough balls.  Place on a baking sheet
lined with wax paper.

4.   Roll the truffles in the grated chocolate, pressing gently to adhere.

5.   Refrigerate overnight.  Remove from refrigeration 15 minutes before
serving.  Note:  these truffles do not hold well at room temperature.
