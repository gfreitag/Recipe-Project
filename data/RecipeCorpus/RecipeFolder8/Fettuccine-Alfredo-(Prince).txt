Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Salt
Pepper, white, dash
Romano cheese to taste
12 oz Fettuccine
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
1 c  Cream, heavy or light
1 1/2 c  Parmesan, grated
We add a little romano to this for extra flavor- not in the original
recipe- about 1 or 2 tablespoons.

Cook fettuccine according to package directions.  While fettuccine cooks,
heat butter or margarine and cream in a small sauce pan until butter melts.
Stir in parmesan cheese., salt and pepper.  Keep warm over low heat. Drain
fettuccine, return to pan, pour sauce over noodles, toss gently until
noodles are well coated.
