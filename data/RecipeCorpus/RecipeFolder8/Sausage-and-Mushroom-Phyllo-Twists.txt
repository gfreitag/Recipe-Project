Categories: Appetizers, Pork/ham, Sausages
Yield: 6 servings
2 oz Cream cheese softened
16    12 inch sheets phyllo
-stacked between 2 sheets of
-wax
Paper and covered with damp
-dish towel
1/4 c  Clarified butter
2 tb Fine fresh bread crumbs
1/2 lb Pork sausage meat crumbled
1    Minced small onion
1    Minced garlic clove
1 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 lb Mushroom chopped fine
1/2 ts Ground cumin
1 pn Of allspice
1/2 ts Dried crumbled mint
1/4 c  Minced fresh parsley leaves
In a large skillet cook the sausage meat over moderately high heat,
stirring and breaking up any larger pieces, until it is cooked through and
browned.

Transfer meat to a fine sieve, and drain. In the skillet, cook the onion
and the garlic in the unsalted butter over moderately low heat until the
onion is softened. Add the mushrooms, and cook the mixture over moderate
heat, stirring until the liquid  the mushrooms give off evaporates. Add the
cumin, allspice and the mint and cook the mixture, stirring, for 2 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the sausage meat, the parsley, cream
cheese, and salt and pepper to taste, and combine the mixture well. Working
quickly to keep the phyllo from drying out, put 1 sheet of phyllo on a work
surface, brush lightly with some of the clarified butter, and sprinkle with
1 tablespoon of the bread crumbs. Lay another sheet of phyllo on top of the
first sheet and brush lightly with some of the remaining clarified butter.

Cut the sheets into thirds lengthwise and into quarters crosswise to form
12 squares. Put a rounded teaspoon of the filling in each square, gather
the corners of the phyllo over the filling, and twist the phyllo gently to
seal it. Continue to make hors d'oeuvres in the same manner with the
remaining phyllo, butter, crumbs and filling. Bake the sausage and mushroom
phyllo twists in jelly-roll pans in a preheated oven at 400 degrees for
10-12 minutes,or until phyllo is golden brown.
