fourths.  Lightly roll each portion 1/8 inch thick and cut lengthwise into
5 inch wide strips. Use the strips immediately--do nt allow to dry. Place 2
teaspoons of the filling 1 1/2 inches from the narrow end and in the center
of the strip. Continue along the strip, placing the filling at about 3 1/2
inch intervals.  Fold the strip in half lengthwise, covering the mounds of
filling.  To seal, press the edges together with the tines of a fork. Press
gently between the mounds to form rectangles about 3 1/2 inches long. Cut
apart with a pastry cutter and press the cut edges with the tines of a fork
to seal. COOKING In a large saucepan bring to a boil: 7 quarts water 2 Tb
