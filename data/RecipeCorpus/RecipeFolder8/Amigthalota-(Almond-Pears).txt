3 c  Ground almonds
1/2 c  Icing sugar; sifted
1/4 c  Egg whites (1/4 c = 2 whites
1/2 ts Grated lemon rind, optional
Makes: 30 Cooking time: 20 minutes Oven temperature: 160 C (325 F)

Blend ground almonds with icing sugar measured after sifting.  Add lightly
beaten egg whites with lemon rind if used and almond essence.  Mix to a
firm dough with hands.  Clean hands and rub with a little butter to prevent
dough sticking while shaping.  Break off small pieces of dough the size of
a walnut and form into pear shapes.  Insert a whole clove in the top of
each to resemble a stem and place upright on a buttered and floured baking
sheet.

Bake in a moderately slow oven for 20 minutes, covering with brown paper if
tops begin to brown.   Sift 2 cups icing sugar into a bowl and dip hot
Amigthalota into it.  If desired, a little rose or orange flower water may
be brushed onto Amigthalota before dipping into icing sugar.  Place on a
wire rack to cool.

Sift remaining sugar from bowl into base of a container and arrange cooled
Almond Pears upright in a single layer.  Sift more sugar thickly over tops
and sides, seal and store for a day or two before using.
