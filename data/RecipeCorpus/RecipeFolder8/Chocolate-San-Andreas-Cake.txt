fault becaus it forms big cracks as it bakes and cools.

Adjust the oven rack to the lower third of the oven.  Prehat the oven to
350 degrees F.  Butter and flour a 10-inch springform pan.

Heat the chocolates and butter in a double boiler over simmering water,
stirring frequently, until melted.  Remove from the heat and cool to room
temperature, stirring occasionally. about 25 minutes.

Beat the eggs in a large mixer bowl until frothy.  Gradually add the sugar
and beat until mixture becomes thick and lemon-colored and ribbon forms
when the beaters are lifted, about 10 minutes.  Add the vanilla. Gradually
add the chocolate mixture and beat well.  Fold in the flour and pour the
batter into the prepared pan.

Bake 45 to 50 minutes, until the top of the cake begins to crack. Cool
completely in the pan on a wire rack, then wrap and refrigerate overnight.
Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before serving. Remove the sides
of the pan and place on a serving plate.  Sprinkle the top with
confectioners' sugar.  For best results, cut the cake with a knife dipped
in warm water, wiping off the knife between cuts.
