Title: Cheese Straws
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 20 servings
3/4 c  Parmesan; grated
1 lb Puff pastry
1.  Roll out puff pastry dough into a rectangle 20 by 24 inches.
Sprinkle half of the Parmesan evenly over the dough and gently press cheese
into the dough with the rolling pin.
2.  Fold the dough in half crosswise, roll it out again to 20 by 24
inches, and sprinkle on remaining cheese.
3.  Using a sharp thin knife, cut the dough into 1/3-inch strips. Take
each strip by its end and twist until evenly corkscrewed.  Lay the twists
of dough on an ungreased baking sheet, arranged so they are just touching
each other; this will prevent untwisting.
4.  Set the baking sheet in the middle of a preheated 350F oven and
bake until the straws are crisp, puffed brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
5.  Remove from the oven, cool for 5 minutes, then cut apart with a
sharp knife.  Finish cooling the straws on a rtack, then store them in an
airtight tin or plastic bag until serving time.  They will stay fresh for
about 1 week. About 20 straws. Arrange a basketful on the bar when
entertaining and watch them disappear! Source: The Silver Palate Cookbook
