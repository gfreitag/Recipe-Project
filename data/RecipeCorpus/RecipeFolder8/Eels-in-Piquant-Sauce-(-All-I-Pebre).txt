Title: Eels in Piquant Sauce ( All I Pebre)
Categories: Appetizers, Sauces
Yield: 10 servings
14    Blanched almonds
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1/4 ts Saffron
1 tb Olive oil
Salt to taste
4 lb Eel
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Paprika
2 c  Hot water
3    Garlic cloves; chopped
A favorite Valencian tapa as well as a popular main dish, especially along
the Costa Blanca. A cold beer might go best with this piquant tapa.

Clean and skin eels and cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch pieces. Heat 1 tablespoon
olive oil in a casserole or skillet, add paprika, and stir in enough water
to cover eels. Bring to a boil and add pieces of eel. Meanwhile with a
mortar and pestle or in an electric blender crush garlic, almonds, parsley,
and saffron with enough olive oil to make a smooth paste. Stir mixture into
casserole, add salt to taste, and cook for about 20 minutes or until eels
are done. Add more water if sauce thickens. Serve hot.

Variation: For an all-in-one meal or a main course, add peas, chopped
carrots, or new potatoes (or all three) and serve over rice, as they do in
Valencia.
