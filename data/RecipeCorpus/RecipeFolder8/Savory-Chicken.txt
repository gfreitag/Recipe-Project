Savory Chicken is so fast and so good you will just want to stand and eat
it out of the pan.

(Home Spice Blend: use approximately the measurements below for spices. For
the spice blend, combine cumin, cayenne pepper, thyme, garlic and onion
powders, salt and flour.  Increase the spice amounts if you are cooking
more than 2 1/2 pounds of chicken.)

1  tsp cumin powder 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 1 tsp crushed thyme 1/2 tsp
garlic powder 1/2 tsp onion powder 1/2 tsp salt 1 Tbs flour 2 Tbs butter 1
or 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 or 2 jalapeno chiles, seeded, minced 1/2 cup
to 3/4 cup light beer This recipe doubles easily but don't try to saute the
chicken all at once. After the chicken is skinned and boned, rub it with
your home spice blend.  If you get inspired, add another spice. Let the
spiced chicken sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes.

Using a heavy 12-inch skillet, heat the butter and oil and add 1 cup of the
chicken pieces at a time.  Saute over medium heat until golden. Remove to a
plate.  Saute the rest of the chicken, adding more oil if necessary. When
all the chicken is sauteed, drain off any excess oil. Put all the chicken
pieces back in the pan, along with the chiles and garlic and add the beer.
A great head of steam will rise up the the most wonderful aroma. Quickly
now, clamp on the lid and turn the heat to low.  Check every 5 minutes and
turn the chicken in the reducing broth.  Cook for about 15 to 18 minutes.
If the broth cooks away toward the end of the cooking, just add a
tablespoon more beer.  At the end you should be left with a nice thick
glaze.  Push the chicken around the beer glaze so it all gets coated. This
is about the best taco meat you will ever encounter. Since tacos are filled
with other things, the recipe above will serve 4 people unless you ate too
much out of the pan.
