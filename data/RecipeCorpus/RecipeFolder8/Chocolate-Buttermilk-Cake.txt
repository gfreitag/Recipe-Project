Title: Chocolate Buttermilk Cake
Categories: Chocolate, Cakes/choc.
Yield: 8 servings
1 1/2 tb Instant Coffee Crystals
2 c  Sweet Butter
2 1/4 c  Sugar
2 1/4 c  10x Powdered Sugar
3    Eggs
2 1/4 c  Heavy Cream
3 c  Flour
1 1/4 c  Cocoa
1 1/2 ts Baking Soda
1 1/2 ts Baking Powder
1 1/2 ts Ground Cinnamon
2 1/4 c  Buttermilk
1 1/2 c  Thick Sour Cream
THE CAKE: Preheat oven to 350Ã¸F.  Grease 3 round, 9" cake pans. Line
bottoms with greased wax paper. Sift together flour, 3/4 c cocoa, baking
soda, baking powder and cinnamon. Mix in buttermilk and coffee (dissolve
coffee in an equal amount of hot water first.) Cream 1 1/2 c butter with
the sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time until thick.
Beating on low speed, slowly mix in buttermilk mixture. Beat 'til well
blended.  Bake about 35 minutes, or until a straw comes out clean. Remove
to racks to cool.  After they are cooled, put in 'fridge'. After 1 hour in
'fridge', split each in half (see note at bottom.) Wrap each layer in wax
paper or plastic wrap, and freeze immediately. SOUR CREAM FILLING: Beat 3/4
c heavy cream, gradually adding 3/4 c 10x sugar until stiff. Gently fold in
3/4 c sour cream. Set aside in 'fridge' (covered.) CHOCOLATE SOUR CREAM
FROSTING: Melt remaining (1/2 c) butter.  Add 1/2 c 10x sugar and remaining
(1/2 c) cocoa.  Stir with a wire whisk over low heat until smooth; cool.
Beat remaining (1 1/2 c) heavy cream; add remaining (1 1/2 c) 10x sugar
until soft peaks form.  Add cooled chocolate mixture; beat until stiff.
Fold in remaining (3/4 c) sour cream. CONSTRUCTION: Build layers from the
bottom up as follows: Cake, 1/3 the filling, cake, 2/3 c frosting. Repeat
above twice, for total of six layers. Put remaining frosting on sides.
Chill two hours before serving. Note: The cakes must be well-chilled before
assembly, or they will disintegrate under their own weight during assembly.
If the cake tops rose during baking, the layers will not stack well. You
will need to slice the excess off *after* chilling, but *before* splitting
into layers. Source: Someone named Judith Olney, I'm sure. This was printed
in some newspaper about 1983--probably the Durham [NC] Morning Herald. This
is one incredible cake--a chocoholic's fantasy. Posted by Brian Groover
