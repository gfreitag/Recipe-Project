Title: Cheddar, Sage, and Walnut Torta
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Appetizers
Yield: 1 servings
-(such as Vermont Cabot)
-- shredded
1 c  Walnuts, chopped
Whole walnut halves
1/2 lb Cream cheese; softened
3 tb Fresh sage leaves, chopped
Whole sage leaves
1/2 lb Sharp cheddar cheese
Place the cream cheese in a food processor with the chopped sage leaves.
Blend.  Line a 2-cup mold with a double thickness of cheesecloth. Arrange
the whole sage leaves in a decorative pattern on the bottom of the mold.
Add half the cream cheese mixture, then add shredded cheddar, smoothing out
the layer and pressing it slightly. Add the walnuts, again pressing gently.
Smooth the remaining cream cheese mixture over the walnuts. Fold the ends
of the cheesecloth over the top of the torta mixture and press lightly.
Refrigerate the mold overnight.

To unmold, fold back the top of the cheesecloth.  Invert a serving plate on
top of the mold and flip them over together.  Lift off the mold and
carefully remove the cheesecloth.  Garnish the torta with walnut halves.
