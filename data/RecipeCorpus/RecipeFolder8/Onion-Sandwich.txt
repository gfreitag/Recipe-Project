Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 6 servings
Salt; to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
- to taste
1 c  Minced parsley
24 sl Firm-textured egg bread,thin
- such as challah or brioche
6 tb Mayonnaise
12 sl Onion, wafer thin
USING A 1 3/4-INCH COOKIE CUTTER, cut out rounds for the centers of the
bread slices. Spread mayonnaise on each of the bread rounds with a small
spatula. The diameter of the onion slices should approximate that of the
bread rounds. Sprinkle each with salt and pepper. Place 1 onion slice on
each half of the rounds. Cover each one with another bread round,
mayonnaise side down, on top of the onion. Using the spatula, spread the
outside rim of the sandwich with mayonnaise, coating fairly liberally. Roll
the rim of each sandwich in parsley to coat.
