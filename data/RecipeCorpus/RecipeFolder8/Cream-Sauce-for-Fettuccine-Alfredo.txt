Title: Cream Sauce for Fettuccine Alfredo
Categories: Italian, Sauces, Pasta
Yield: 5 servings
To taste
1/4 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
Cheese
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
1 c  Whipping cream
Salt and WHITE pepper
Melt butter in a large skillet.  When butter foams, add cream. Simmer over
medium heat about 2 minutes until slightly thickened. Season with salt and
white pepper

When your fettuccine has been cooked, drain noodles and place in the
skillet with the cream.  Add 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  Toss noodles and
sauce over medium heat until sauce coats noodles, 20 to 30 seconds. Serve
immediately with additional Parmesan cheese. Makes 4 to 6 servings.
