Title: Deviled Crab Quiche
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 8 servings
4 oz Crabmeat, flaked
3    Eggs
2/3 c  Half-and-half
1/2 ts Mustard powder
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
Salt to taste
Tomato slices (opt)
Italian parsley sprigs (opt)
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Chili seasoning
1/4 c  Cold margarine, diced
1/4 c  Lard, diced
1/2 c  Finely grated Cheddar cheese
3 tb Cold water
6 sl Bacon, chopped
2    Onion, chopped
Preheat oven to 400'F. (205'C.). In a bowl, combine flour, salt and chili
seasoning. Cut in margarine and lard until mixture resembles bread crumbs.
Add cheese and mix well. Stir in cold water and mix to form a fairly firm
dough. Knead gently on a floured surface and roll out pastry. Set a 10"
flouted flan pan with a removable bottom on a baking sheet. Press pastry
into flutes and trim edge neatly. Prick base with a fork. Line pastry with
waxed paper and fill with dried beans.

Bake 15 minutes. Remove waxed paper and beans and bake 5-10 minutes more or
until dry and lightly golden. Fry bacon 3 minutes. Add onion; cook 2
minutes. Remove from heat; mix with crabmeat. Spoon mixture into flan
shell. Whisk eggs, half-and-half, mustard, cayenne and salt. Pour into flan
shell. Bake 30-35 minutes or until set and lightly golden. Garnish with
tomato and parsley, if desired, and serve warm or cold.
