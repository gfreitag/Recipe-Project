MMMMM-----------------------BEEF MARINADE----------------------------

CUT THE BEEF into 1/4-inch thick by 1 1/2-inch long by 1/2-inch wide
slices; put into a bowl and toss with the beef marinade. Set aside.
Cover the black beans with water until soft, about 5 minutes. Drain
and rinse off excess salt with water. Place in a small bowl and mash
together with garlic and ginger into a coarse paste; set aside.
Separate the strands of rice noodles. Set aside. Over high heat,
preheat the wok until hot. Add half the oil and swirl it to coat the
sides. When the oil is hot, add the beef; toss until the beef loses
its redness, about 30-to-45 seconds.

Remove to a bowl; set aside. Add remaining oil to wok. While the oil
is warming add the black bean mixture; stir-fry until fragrant, about
10 seconds. Over high heat, add the onions and peppers; stir-fry
until they begin to soften but are still crisp, about 1 minute. Add
the rice noodles; stir-fry to coat the strands with seasoned oil,
about 30 seconds. Add the white pepper, sugar and soy sauce; toss
until evenly distributed. Return the beef; toss a few turns to mix
in. Transfer to a serving platter. Serve immediately.
