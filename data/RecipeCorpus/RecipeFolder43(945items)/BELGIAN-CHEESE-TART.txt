MMMMM----------------------------TART---------------------------------
1/2 lb Cream Cheese
3 tb Confectioners' Sugar
1 ts Lemon Juice
2 ea Eggs; Large
2/3 c  Heavy Cream
NOTE:  As this is a tart rather than a cheesecake, you should use an
8-inch tart pan or flan ring. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a
large mixing bowl, beat together the cheese, sugar and lemon juice
until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time
beating well after each addition.  Beat until very smooth after the
last addition. Stir in the cream and pour mixture into the prepared
crust. Brush the top of the tart with an egg and 1 TBLS of
confectioners sugar that has been beaten together. Bake for 25
minutes or until set. Cool to room temperature and then chill before
serving.
