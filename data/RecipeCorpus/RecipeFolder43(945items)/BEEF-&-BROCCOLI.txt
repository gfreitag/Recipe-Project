Title: BEEF & BROCCOLI
Categories: Meats, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Boneless beef*
1 tb Oyster sauce**
2 ts Rice wine**
1/2 ts Brown sugar**
2 ts Cornstarch**
1 lb Broccoli; chopped
2 ts Rice wine***
1/2 ts Brown sugar***
1 ts Cornstarch; dissolved in ***
2 tb Water***
3 tb Peanut oil
2    Slices ginger; minced
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Water
2 ts Sesame oil
*(Flank steak, top sirloin, or tenderloin), sliced across grain into
thin s **(combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl) ***(combine all
seasoning sauce ingredients in a cup) Thoroughly mix beef with
marinade and marinate for 30 minutes.  Heat wok over highest heat,
when hot, swirl in 2 Tblsp peanut oil.
Add ginger and salt and toss a few seconds.  Add broccoli and
stirfry one minute, then add water, turn heat to med-high, cover, and
steam until crisp tender.
Uncover and turn heat to high, stir frying until water is evaporated.
Remove broccoli and reserve. Reheat same wok (without rinsing) and,
when hot, add remaining peanut oil. Add beef slices and stirfry until
lightly browned but not cooked through.  Do not stirfry too
vigorously or meat will not brown, it is better to press slices
against sides of wok to sear. Add broccoli to wok and toss.  When
hot, stir in seasoning sauce and stir until sauce thickens (it's a
good idea to whisk the sauce in the cup just before you hurl it into
the wok). Turn onto a platter and drizzle sesame oil over the top.
The sugar in the marinade and seasoning sauce acts as a floor
enhancer rather than a sweetener. I hope you enjoy this recipe.
