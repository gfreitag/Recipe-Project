Title: BELL PEPPER BISQUE
Categories: Soups, Stews
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Long-grain white rice
4 lg Red bell peppers -- coarsely
Chopped
1 sm Onion -- chopped
2 c  Chicken stock
2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/4 ts Cayenne
1/4 ts Hungarian sweet paprika
1/8 ts White pepper
Salt to taste
Place the rice in a small saucepan with 2 cups of water. Bring to a
boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered until the rice is
overcooked and mushy and the water has almost boiled away, about 40
minutes. In a medium saucepan, combine the red peppers, onion and 2
cups of water. Boil over moderate heat until the peppers are tender
but still bright red, about 10 minutes. Drain at once.

Put the rice, red peppers, onion and 1 cup of the chicken stock into a
blender or food processor.  Puree until smooth.

Strain the puree into a medium saucepan, add the milk and the
remaining 1 cup of chicken stock.  Simmer over low heat for 5 minutes
to thicken slightly.  Stir in the cream, cayenne, paprika and white
pepper. Season with salt to taste.  Cover the bisque and set aside
for 1 hour to blend the favors.  Rewarm over low heat before serving.

NOTE: May be made day ahead of time.
