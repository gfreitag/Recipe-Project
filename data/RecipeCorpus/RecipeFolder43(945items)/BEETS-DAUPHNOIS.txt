The author writes: "A color version of the familiar scalloped
potatoes...a hearty dish served alongside broiled fish and brown
rice."

Scrub beets; trim stem end to 1/2".  Leave root end intact. In a large
saucepan, boil beets for 25 minutes, until just tender enough to
stick a knife through the center. Drain; peel and slice in 1/4" discs.

Preheat oven to 400 F.

In a saucepan, combine beet slices, chicken stock, cream, scallions,
garlic and tarragon.  Bring to a boil. Stir and remove from heat.

Butter a 1 1/2 qt. gratin dish and spread the beet mixture out.
Sprinkle with grated cheese.  Bake 30 minutes.
