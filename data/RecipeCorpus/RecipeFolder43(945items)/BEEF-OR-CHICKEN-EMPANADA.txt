onion in oil for 1 minute.  Add shredded chicken meat, potato, green

Cook lean ground beef.  Drain fat.  Set meat aside. Saute onion in

peas, a little salt and pepper. Cover and simmer for 8-10 minutes
until vegetables are cooked. Remove from skillet. Let cool. Pastry:

pastry blender until mixture is crumbly. Combine egg yolks and ice
water and blend into flour mixture until it turns into dough. Add a
little more water if dough is still crumbly. Refrigerate for 30
minutes. With a rolling pin, roll dough thinly, about 1/4 inch thick,
on a lightly floured board. Roll up dough to a long thin roll. Cut
into slices about 1-inch thick. Flatten each slice thinly into a
circle about the size of a small saucer. Fill middle of round dough

firmly with tines of a fork to seal. Repeat procedure with remaining
pastry and filling. Deep fry in vegetable oil over medium  heat until
golden brown. Yield: 20-22 pieces. Tip: You may double this recipe
