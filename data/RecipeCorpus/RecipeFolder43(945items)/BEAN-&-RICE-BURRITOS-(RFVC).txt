Title: BEAN & RICE BURRITOS (RFVC)
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 2 Servings
None
Filling: 1 28 ounce can water-packed pinto beans, drained and rinsed,
1-2 cups cooked brown rice, dash each: chili powder, garlic powder,
cumin; 3/4 cup water,

6    tortillas

Toppings: 1 head iceberg lettuce, chopped and dried, 1 bunch
scallions, chopped, 1 ripe tomato, chopped, Mexican salsa

Place the beans in a saucepan and mash with a potato masher. Add the
cooked rice, spices, and water.  Heat 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
prepare the vegetables. Heat the tortillas quickly (just to soften)
in a preheated skillet, toaster oven, or microwave.  Place a line of
bean mixture down the middle of each tortilla. Top with lettuce,
scallions, tomato, and salsa. Tuck in the top and bottom edges, roll
into a burrito, and serve immediately, topped with additional salsa
if desired.
