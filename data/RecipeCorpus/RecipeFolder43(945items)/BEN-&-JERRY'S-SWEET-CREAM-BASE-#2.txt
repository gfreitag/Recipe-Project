Title: BEN & JERRY'S SWEET CREAM BASE #2
Categories: Ice cream, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Heavy or whipping cream
3/4 c  Sugar
2/3 c  Half & half
This simple recipe is made with a minimum of ingredients and requires
no cooking. It makes a very creamy ice cream with 25% butterfat, but
it does not store well in home freezers, so be prepared to eat it
all!! Pour the cream into a mixing bowl. Whisk in the sugar, a little
at a time, then continue whisking until completely blended, about 1
minute more. Pour the half and half and whisk to blend. Makes 1 quart.
