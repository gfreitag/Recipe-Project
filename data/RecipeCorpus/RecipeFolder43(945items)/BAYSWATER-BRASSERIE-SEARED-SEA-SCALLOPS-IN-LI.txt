Stephen Ceideburg
12 lg Jerusalem Artichokes
Olive oil
12    Cloves shallots
20    Scallops
4    Kaffir Lime Leaves
8    Wing Beans
600 ml Fish Stock
3    Limes, Juice Only
2 tb Fish Sauce
Pepper to taste
True shallots (echalotes) are gradually becoming more widely
available. They look rather like a large, loose head of garlic with
glossy red-brown skin.

Clean and peel 12 large Jerusalem artichokes. Put a little olive oil
in a roasting pan, add the artichokes and roast in a medium oven
until golden, a little caramelized and cooked through - about 20
minutes. Peel and slice 12 cloves of true shallots. Brush 28 scallops
lightly with oil on both sides. Have ready 4 kaffir lime leaves (or
substitute zest from the limes). Wash 8 wing beans (or substitute 4
very small bok choys about 10 cms tall - halve them lengthwise) and
blanch in boiling water.

Put the blanched vegetables in 4 large bowls (pasta bowls or similar),
together with the whole roasted artichokes, and scatter the sliced
shallots over the top. Meanwhile, in a saucepan com- bine 600 mL fish
stock, the juice of 3 limes, Thai fish sauce to taste (about 2
tablespoons) and pepper to taste and bring to the boil.

Heat an iron grill or heavy frying pan to a very high heat. Do not
grease. Throw in the oiled scallops and sear them very quickly on
both sides, so that they take colour on the outside but are barely
warm inside. Divide the scallops between the soup bowls, top with the
lime leaves and pour in the broth. Serve.
