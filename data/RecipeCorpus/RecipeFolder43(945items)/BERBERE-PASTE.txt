Berbere is the famous, or should we say, infamous, scorching
Ethiopian hot sauce, as well as the official language of Ethiopia.
This highly spiced sauce is used as an ingredient in a number of
dishes, a coating when drying meats, and as a side dish or condiment.

Toast the cardamom, cumin, peppercorns and fenugreek in a hot skillet,
shaking constantly, for a couple of minutes, until they start to
crackle and pop.  Grind these spices to form a fine powder.

Combine the onions, garlic, and 1/2 cup water in a blender and puree
until smooth.  Add the chiles and the spices and continue to blend.
Slowly add the remaining water and oil and blend until smooth.

Simmer the sauce for 15 minutes to blend the flavors annd thicken.

Serve sparingly as a condiment with grilled meats and poultry or add
to soups and stews.
