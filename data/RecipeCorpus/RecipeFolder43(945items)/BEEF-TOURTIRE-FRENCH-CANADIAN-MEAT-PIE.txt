Title: BEEF TOURTIÂŠRE FRENCH CANADIAN MEAT PIE
Categories: Pies/tarts
Yield: 2 Servings
6 x  Or 7 medium potatoes
2 tb Oil
1 1/2 lb Medium ground beef
1 lg Onion, diced
1/4 ts Allspice
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Garlic salt
Salt and pepper to taste
Pastry for 2 double-crust
9-inch pies
COMMENTS: The large quantity of potatoes and modest amount of
seasonning seems to reduce the beef flavor. We vote for a little less
potato and an extra pinch of spice. Boil potatoes and mash coarsely.
Heat oil in large, heavy duty frying pan and brown beef and onion.
Stir in potatoes, allspice, cinnamon, garlic salt, salt and pepper.
Preheat oven to 400'F.. Line two 9-inch pie pans with pastry. Using
slotted spoon, fill pans with meat mixture. Cover with top crusts,
cutting vents so steam can escape. Bake= in preheated oven for 45
minutes or until golden-brown. Makes two tourti=8Ares. from the
