over medium heat, then simmer for about 1 1/2 hours.
Meanwhile, finely chop the remaining onion, chop up the
tomatoes in a food processor and cut the ham and salt pork into
small pieces.
Heat 1/4 c  of the oil and lightly saute the onion, ham and
salt pork for about 10 minutes, then add the tomatoes. Taste

about 10 minutes, then set aside.
Clean and wash the cabbage. Cut into 1/2-inch strips. When
the beans have finished cooking, remove about half the beans
and vegetables with a slotted spoon and puree in a food
processor. Return the puree to the stockpot and add enough cold
water to make about 4 quarts liquid and bring to a boil. Add
cabbage and simmer about 25 minutes, then add tomatoes and meat
to the stockpot and simmer 5 minutes longer.
Toast the slices of bread and place in each individual soup
bowl. Ladle the soup over the bread and serve, adding a

1/2 ts dried for each tb fresh, or to taste.
