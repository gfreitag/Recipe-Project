In a large saucepan, saute onion and garlic in butter. When the
onions are transparent add the remainder of ingredients. Bring to a
boil. Simmer until your grill is ready, about 10 to 15 minutes or
until you can't stand the wonderful smell of the sauce any longer.
Now let me tell you, this is what I call barbecue sauce.
