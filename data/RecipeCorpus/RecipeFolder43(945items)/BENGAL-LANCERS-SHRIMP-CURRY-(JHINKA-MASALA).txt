This dish was popular with the Bengal Lancers regiment around the
turn of the century. For a change of pace, try it over pasta or
Indian basmati rice.

Sprinkle shrimp with salt and turmeric. Toss well to coat; cover and
set aside for 15 minutes.

Combine mustard, cumin, garlic, ginger, chiles and lemon juice in a
blender and puree. Set aside.

Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions
and cook until soft, about 3 minutes.

Add pureed spice mixture. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 5
minutes.

Stir in tomato and cook until soft. Add shrimp, stir gently to coat
them evenly.

Pour in the water and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.

Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until shrimp are just opaque,
about 5 minutes.

Mound rice into heated serving plates. Spoon curry over and serve.

Note: Basmati rice has a distinctive nutty flavor. It is available at
Indian, Middle Eastern, some specialty food stores and supermarkets.
