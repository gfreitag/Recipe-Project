Title: BEAN LASAGNE
Categories: Digest, Sept.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 cn Ff vegetarian refried beans
1    12 oz bottle mild taco
Sauce
2 cn Stewed tomatoes, one
Drained, one not
1 c  Ff cottage cheese
1 c  Corn kernels, frozen is ok
10    To 12 lasagne noodles,
Uncooked
1/4 c  Black olives, sliced
In a bowl mix beans with about half the juice from one can of
tomatoes and a couple of tablespoons of taco sauce. You want the
beans to be almost but not quite pourable. Mix the rest of the taco
sauce and tomato juice and set aside.

Put about a quarter of the taco sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13"
lasagne pan. Cover sauce with a layer of noodles. Layer, in any order
you want, the beans, corn, cheese, drained tomatoes, sauce and
noodles, being sure to end up with enough beans to cover the top with
no noodles showing. The resulting mess should be pretty wet.

Cover tightly with foil.  Bake at 350 for about an hour, until the
noodles are tender. Check every 5-10 minutes after 45 minutes of
cooking to see how the noodles are doing. Remove foil, sprinkle with
olives. Bake another couple of minutes. Let sit for about 5 minutes
before serving.

Serves 3-4 as a main dish. Tastes even better the next day.

Variation: If you want to pre-cook the noodles, don't use as much
tomato juice and cook for only about 30 minutes.

Variation: Other veggies would work well in here too. What do you
have in the frig?

Variation: You could top it with a little ff cheese-stuff in the last
few minutes. And no doubt you could make it vegan by leaving off all
milk products altogether.
