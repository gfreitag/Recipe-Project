MMMMM--------------------BELGIAN ENDIVE SALAD-------------------------
4    3 ounce Belgian Endives
Assorted Wild or Pickled
Mushrooms
Assorted fresh herbs and
Pesticide-free edible
Flowers
Pickled Ginger, sliced
1    Plum Tomato
Marinade: In a screw-top jar combine wine vinegar, olive oil, salt and
sugar. Cover and shake well. Set aside.

Belgian Endive Salad: Cut Belgian endive into fan shapes. Using a
large knife, cut each endive lengthwise from endive tips to base,
cutting to but not through the base. Turn endive a quarter turn and
cut lengthwise again. This now forms 4 large "petals." Cut each
quarter lengthwise again to form 8 "petals" that are still held
intact by the base.

Run cold water into center of each endive. Drain. Arrange in a shallow
dish. Shake marinade and pour over endive. Marinate 10 minutes,
spooning marinade over endive twice. Remove endive from marinade with
a slotted spoon. Drain on paper towels, patting gently to remove
excess marinade.

On each of 4 serving plates, spread out an endive "fan." Scatter
mushrooms over endive. Decorate endive "petals" with fresh herbs and
flowers to resemble a flower arrangement. Arrange ginger on each
endive near base. Halve tomato crosswise, using a zigzag cut. Remove
pulp and seeds. Cut each tomato half in half again, lenghtwise. Fit a
tomato quarter over base of each endive to form a "vase."
