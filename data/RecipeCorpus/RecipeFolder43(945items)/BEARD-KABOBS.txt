Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Salmon fillets; cubed 1 1/2
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Olive oil; -or- peanut oil
4 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Pepper

Mix the salmon and seasonings and let it stand for 3-6 hours. When
you are ready to broil it, place a mushroom cap on the end of each
skewer, then 2 salmon cubes, another mushroom, more salmon, and end
with a mushroom cap. Brush well with oil.

Place skewers on a rack over the grill, turning several times during
the process, basting with the marinade. Serve with plain boiled
potatoes and fresh dill. (If you can't get fresh dill, serve dill
pickles.)

Serves 4.
