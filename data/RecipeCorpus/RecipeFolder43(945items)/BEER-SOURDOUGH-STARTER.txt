-KYLLIKKI FULLER (BHHJ17B)
1    Beer; flat
1 1/4 c  Flour
Mix well, let sit on counter 5-10 days, stir 3 x per day. When it
begins to separate into creamy thick bottom and thin liquid top is
ready to use in any sourdough recipe. I do have a good sour bread
recipe if anyone needs it reposted... it's a killer for tang! Kylli
