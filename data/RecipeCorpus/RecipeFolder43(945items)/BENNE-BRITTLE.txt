Title: BENNE BRITTLE
Categories: Candies, Christmas
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 ts Lemon extract
2 c  Parched benne seed (sesame
-seeds, I think)
"Benne seeds cannot be procured in many places, but the candy made
with it is so delicious and so characteristic of Charleston that the
recipe is here included."

Add the extracts to the sugar.  Melt the sugar in a saucepan, stirring
constantly, as for peanut brittle. When the sugar is melted, add the
benne seed, stirring it in quickly. Pour at once onto a marble slab
to cool or pour into lightly buttered pans.  Mark in one-inch squares
while still warm and break along the lines when cold. --Mrs. Rhett
