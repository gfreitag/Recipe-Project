Title: BEER STEAMED SAUSAGES
Categories: Meats, Crockpot
Yield: 4 Servings
-T.FOX5
1 cn Beer;room temp
-(any brand or type will do)
Smoked sausage;enough to
-fill crock pot
Cut each pound of smoked sausage into 4 pieces.  Pour the beer in the
bottom of the crock pot and pile in the sausage. Cook on HIGH for 2
hours, then switch to LOW until ready to serve.
Those who like a strong beer taste will want the pieces that actually
bathed in the beer.  The pieces toward the top of the crock pot will
have a more delicate beery tang. During the 2 hours of cooking, the
alcohol in the beer will evaporate completely, so the whole family
can enjoy these. :) Posted on Genie 8/1/91
