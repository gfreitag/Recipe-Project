Categories: Condiments, Ethiopia
Yield: 1 Servings
To make about 2 cups.
1 ts Ground ginger
1/2 ts Ground cardamom
1/2 ts Ground coriander
1/2 ts Fenugreek seeds
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg, preferably
-freshly grated
1/8 ts Ground cloves
1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
1/8 ts Ground allspice
2 tb Finely chopped onions
1 tb Finely chopped garlic
2 tb Salt
3 tb Dry red wine
2 c  Paprika
2 tb Ground hot red pepper
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 c  Water
1 ea To 2 tablespoons vegetable
-oil
In a heavy 2 to 3 quart saucepan (preferably one with an enamelled or
non-stick surface), toast the ginger, cardamom, coriander, fenugreek,
nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and allspice over low heat for a minute or
so, stirring them constantly until they are heated through. Then
remove the pan from the heat and let the spices cool for 5 to 10
minutes. Combine the toasted spices, onions, garlic, 1 tablespoon of
the salt and the wine in the jar of an electric blender and blend at
high speed until the mixture is a smooth paste. Combine the paprika,
red pepper, black pepper and the remaining tablespoon of the salt in
the saucepan and toast them over low heat for a minute or so, until
they are heated through, shaking the pan and stirring the spices
constantly.  Stir in the water, 1/4 cup at a time, then add the spice
and wine mixture. Stirring vigorously, cook over lowest possible heat
for 10 to 15 minutes. With a rubber spatula, transfer the berbere to
a jar or crock, and pack it in tightly. Let the paste cool to room
temperature, then dribble enough oil over the top to make a film at
least 1/4 inch thick.  Cover with foil or plastic wrap and
refrigerate until ready to use. If you replenish the film of oil on
top each time you use the berbere, it can safely be kept in the
refrigerator for 5 or 6 months. Berbere (Red-Pepper and Spice Paste)
