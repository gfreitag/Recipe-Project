Recipe by: timpson@acetek.cs.mci.com (Steven D. Timpson) I make Jerky
by buying about 5+ lbs of beef. Usually a roast. I then remove the
fat. Place the strips of meat into marinade and let soak for about 24
hours. Remove from marinade and allow to air dry for at least one
hour. If you have a meat smoker then omit the liquid smoke and smoke
meat at a low temperature.
