Title: BEEF STEW #1
Categories: Stews
1 pk beef
Yield: 1 Servings
4 lg potatoes
4    carrots
1    onion  -- cooking
2    bay leaves
1 cn peas  -- optional

Brown the beef with the onions in a large pot.  Once the meat is
brown add 3 cups of water and bay leaves. Heat over medium heat while
you peel the potatoes and carrrots. Add potatoes and carrots to the
stew pot. Cover with water.  Bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are
tender. Mix up a flour and water mixture to thicken the stew. Add it
right to the pot. No need to remove the meat/veggies.  Stir well to
make sure you don't get lumps. Add pepper/salt/whatever you like for
spices. I sometimes add garlic when rowning the meat. Oregano is a
nice touch as well. Once the stew is thickened you can serve it.
Sometimes I make dumplings with the stew. I usually buy a box of
Bisquick as it has a recipe on it. Unfortunately I cannot relay the
recipe to you as I don't have any in the house at the moment.  You
would have to talk to my grandmother if you wanted to make them from
scratch. Isn't that the way it always is.
