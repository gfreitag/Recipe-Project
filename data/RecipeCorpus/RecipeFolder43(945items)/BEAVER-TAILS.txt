Beaver Tail
This tid-bit of the old time trappers will be tasted by few of the
younger generation. Broil the beaver tail over hot coals for a few
minutes (or in one of those new electric ovens). The rough scaly hide
will blister and come off, leaving the tail clean, white and solid.
Then roast or boil until tender. This is considered very
strengthening food (use only young beaver). For a special treat,
cool, souse in vinegar, add raw onion rings, salt and pepper to taste.
