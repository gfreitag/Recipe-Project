Title: BEEF BARBECUE
Categories: Meats
Yield: 8 Servings
4 lb Chuck roast
1 lg Onion, chopped
1/2 c  Celery, chopped
2 tb Vinegar
2 tb Brown sugar
3 tb Worcestershire sauce
4 tb Lemon juice
1 c  Catsup
1 ts Chili powder
1 1/2 c  Water
Combine all ingredients and pour over meat.  Cook at 350o until meat
is done.  (I usually cook three hours). Shred with 2 forks or put
through meat grinder. (I return the meat and sauce back to the oven
so the sauce is fully absorbed.)  Can be frozen.
