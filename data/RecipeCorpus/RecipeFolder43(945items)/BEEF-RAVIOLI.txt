2 tb Olive or salad oil
1 ea Small onion, chopped
1 ea Garlic clove, minced
1 tb Sugar
2 ts Basil
1 ts Salt
16 oz Can Tomatoes
6 oz Can Tomato Paste
FILLING:  In 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat, cook beef, onion,
and garlic until all pan juices evaporate, onion is tender, and meat
is browned. Remove skillet from heat; stir in parsley, cheese, and
1/2 ts salt, then egg.  Cover and refrigerate groundbeef filling.
PASTA DOUGH: In large bowl, stir 2-1/4 cups flour with remaining
ingredients to make a stiff dough.  On well-floured surface, knead
dough until smooth and not sticky, about 20 times.  Cover dough with
plastic wrap and let rest 30 minutes for easier rolling. Cut dough
into 4 pieces.
On floured surface with floured rolling pin, roll 1 piece into 12"
by 8" rectangle.  With dull edge of knife, lightly mark dough into
twentyfour 2-inch squares. Place a scant teaspoon of groundbeef
filling in center of each square.  Roll second piece of dough into
12" by 8" rectangle; place over filling. Press around filling and
along edges. With cutter or knife, cut into 24 ravioli; place in
single layer on floured, clean cloth towel. Repeat with remaining
dough and filling. Let ravioli dry 30 minutes. In 8 quart saucepan
over high heat, heat 6 quarts water and 2 teaspoons salt to boiling.
Add ravioli, stirring gently to separate pieces so they do not stick
together; heat to boiling. Reduce heat to medium; cook until tender
but firm. About 5 minutes.  Drain ravioli; serve with Marinara sauce.
MARINARA SAUCE: In 2 quart saucepan over medium-low heat, in hot oil,
cook onion and garlic until tender.  Stir in sugar, basil, salt,
tomatoes with their liquid, and tomato paste; heat mixture to
boiling, stirring to break up tomatoes. Reduce heat to low; cover
saucepan and simmer 20 minutes to blend flavors, stirring
occasionally.
