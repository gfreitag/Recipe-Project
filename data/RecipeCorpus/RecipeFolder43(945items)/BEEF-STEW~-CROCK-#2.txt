To cook on the stove:

Mix the flour, salt and pepper together.  Coat meat with flour
mixture. In a large fry pan, wok, or Dutch Oven, brown the meat in a
little oil (cooking a little meat at a time until all is browned).
Place meat in a large pot and add about 3 cups beef broth,
Worcestershire, garlic, bay leaf, paprika, carrots, onions and
celery. Stir to mix. Cook over medium heat until it comes to a slow
boil, reduce to low and continue cooking (4 hours or so) until the
liquid is reduced and meat is tender, stirring frequently.  Add
potatoes and continue cooking about another 30 minutes or until
potatoes are tender.  Do not use Kitchen Bouquet. If necessary, add a
little flour mixed with water to thicken.
