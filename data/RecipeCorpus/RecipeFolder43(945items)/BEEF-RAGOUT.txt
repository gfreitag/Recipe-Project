Categories: Main dish, Meats, Beef
Yield: 4 Servings
1 md Onion, thinly sliced and
-separated into rings.
1 md Green pepper, thinly sliced.
1 tb Olive oil
1 2/3 lb Boneless beef chuck steak,
-cut into 1/2 inch cubes.
1 cn (17 ounces) stewed tomatoes.
10 3/4 oz Condensed beef broth.
6 oz Tomato paste
1 lg Potato, cut into 1/2 inch
-cubes.
2 tb All-purpose flour.
Combine onions, green pepper and olive oil in 3-quart casserole.
Microwave at high (100%) until green pepper is tender, 2 to 5
minutes. Stir in remaining ingredients. Cover. Microwave at high
(100%) ten minutes. Reduce power to medium (50%). Microwave until
beef and potatoes are tender, 50 minutes to 1 hour, stirring after
half the cooking time. If using oven other than carousel, stir 2 or 3
times during cooking. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes.  Serve over rice,
noodles or potatoes, if desired.

This recipe is from the Sharp Carousel Microwave Cookbook. I made it
for dinner tonight because I had only an hour to make dinner and only
had a roast thawed. I cut the roast into cubes, and I almost made the
time limit, but not quite. It was very good.
