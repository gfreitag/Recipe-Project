Title: BEEF STEW~ PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S FAVORITE
Categories: Meats, Beef, Stews
Yield: 4 Servings
4 ts Oil
2 ea Large onions, sliced
1 1/2 ts Salt
4 lb Lean beef stew meat
1 c  Burgundy wine
1 pk Frozen artichoke hearts
2 pk (8 oz) refrigerated biscuits
1 cl Garlic, split
1/3 c  Flour
1/2 ts Dill weed
1 cn Beef consomme
1 cn Mushrooms (drained)
Butter
Grated Parmesan cheese
Heat oil.  Saute garlic and onions.  Remove. Mix flour, salt, pepper.
Dredge meat and brown well. Return onion to pot. Add dill weed, wine,
and consomme. Cover tightly and simmer about 2 hours or until meat is
tender. Cook artichokes 1 minute less than package directions. Add to
meat. Add mushrooms.  Mix gently. Taste for seasoning. Pour into 2
1/2 quart casserole. Crown with biscuits (brush with butter and
parmesan cheese). Bake 15 to 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Note: I
usually cook the stew in the pot, add canned artichokes (not
marinated) with the mushrooms, simmer until the mushrooms are done,
and serve with french bread. Eliminates the frozen artichodes, canned
biscuits, and baking.
