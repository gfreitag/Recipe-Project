Title: BECCA'S ENCHILADAS VERDE
Categories: Cheese, Pulses and
Yield: 6 Servings
5 lg Flour Tortillas -- (or 6)
1/2 c  Chopped Onion
16 oz Can Refried Beans
1 1/2 c  Salsa -- * see note
12 oz Can Green Enchilada Sauce**
-see note
1 1/2    To 2 Cups Cheddar Cheese
-shredded
* I use a 14 oz. can of Food Club Diced Tomatoes with Green Chilies.
** or red enchilada sauce if desired

Drain the salsa. In a medium bowl mix the refried beans, salsa and
onion. Warm the tortillas. Grease a 9 X 12 inch baking dish. Now,
spread about 1/4 cup of the refried bean mixture evenly over 3/4 of
one tortilla. Sprinkle with a little cheese and roll the tortilla
starting with the part covered with refried beans. Place with the end
of the roll down in the baking dish length-wise. Continue with the
other tortillas until the baking dish is filled (I can usually fit
six in the dish.) Pour the enchilada sauce over the top of the
tortillas evenly and sprinkle with remaining 3/4 - 1 cup of cheese.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

Viva la enchilada! This is one of Brandon and I's favorites. I came
up with this simple recipe a couple of years ago while in college. It
costs about $4.75 and lasts for two meals for us. It also takes very
little time to prepare. You can top it with any of your favorite
toppings too; guacamole, sour cream, black olives and shredded
lettuce. Enjoy!
