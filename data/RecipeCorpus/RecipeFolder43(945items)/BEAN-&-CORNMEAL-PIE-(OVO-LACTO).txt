Categories: Digest, Nov., Ovo
Yield: 1 Servings
2 cn Black beans/kidney beans
2 c  Chopped onions
1 1/2 c  Chopped tomatoes
{canned tomatoes work, just
Drain them}
1/4 c  Salsa {I use hot}

1/2 ts Salt
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
3/4 c  Flour
3/4 c  Cornmeal
3/4 c  Skim milk
2 ts Baking powder
1 ds Salt
2 ts Sugar
1 ds Chili pepper
1    Egg white
1/2 c  Corn kernels
Saute onions & pepper in a little vegetable stock & water till tender
(about 8 mins). Add tomatoes, beans, salsa & corn. Add the spices and
simmer while you get the topping ready.

{Original recipe called for 3 or 4 tablespoons of oil and 1 whole egg
in the batter. I increased the milk slightly, added about 1/2 more
teaspoon of baking powder and used just the egg white}

Sift together dry ingredients. Beat egg white & milk. Stir into flour
& cornmeal mixture - don't overmix. Fold in the corn kernels, and
spread batter over bean mixture and bake at 375 degrees for 25
minutes.

I serve this with plain yogurt {reduced fat, can't get fatfree around
my neck of the woods} & extra salsa on the side.
