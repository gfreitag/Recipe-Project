1/4 c  Margarine; melted
1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose;
1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped;
1/2 c  Raisins (optional)
2 ea Eggs; well beaten
1 1/2 ts Vanilla essence;
1/2 ts Salt;
Butter an 8 inch square pan. Line with waxed paper and butter the
paper. Whirl the tepary beans in a food processor until smooth. In a
large bowl, mix the processed beans with rest of the ingredients.
Spread in prepared baking dish. Bake at 325 degrees F for 30 to 35
minutes. Cool, before removing from the pan. Peel off waxed paper and
cut into squares. Makes 16 2 inch squares.

NOTE:  A rich, moist brownie, so terrific you'll probably want to
make a double batch.  No one will guess their secret goodness is
tepary beans. Carob powder is made from pods of the Carob tree,
processed to resemble cocoa powder.  However Carob contains more
nutrients and is caffeine free. It is sold in Health Food Stores.
