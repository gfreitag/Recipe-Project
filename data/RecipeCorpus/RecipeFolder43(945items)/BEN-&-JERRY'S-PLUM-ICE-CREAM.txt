Title: BEN & JERRY'S PLUM ICE CREAM
Categories: Ice cream, Fruits
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Ripe plums; peeled, chopped
1/4 c  Sugar
Sweet cream Base
If you really like plums, this is the flavor to try. The recipe works
well with any variety of plum, as long as it's fresh ( and ripe!)
Combine the plums and sugar in a bowl and mash until pureed. Cover
and refrigerate 1 hour. Prepare the sweet Cream Base. Drain the juice
from the plums into the cream base and blend. Return the plum puree
to the refrigerator. Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and
freeze following manufacturer's instructions. After the ice cream
stiffens ( about 2 minutes before it is done) add the plum puree,
then continue freezing until the ice cream is ready. Makes 1 generous
quart.
