Title: BEEF RENDANG
Categories: Indonesian, Beef
Yield: 4 Servings
1 kg Rump steak
2    Onions, chopped
4    Garlic cloves, chopped
1 tb Fresh ginger, chopped
4 sm Red chillies, chopped
1/2 c  Water
2 ts Ground coriander
2 tb Tamarind sauce
1 ts Ground turmeric
10    Curry leaves
Lemon grass, 10 cm stem
4 c  Coconut milk
1. Remove fat and sinew from steak, cut meat into 3 cm cubes, place in
bowl. 2. In food processor, combine onions, garlic, ginger, chillies
and water, blend until smooth. Add the mixture to steak. 3. Add
coriander, tamarind sauce, turmeric, curry leaves and lemon grass,
stir until combined. Stir in coconut milk. Bring to a boil, reduce
heat to medium, simmer, uncovered for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
Reduce heat to very low, simmer for 30 minutes, stirring frequently
until the meat is very tender and liquid has been absorbed. Remove
lemon grass before serving. NOTE: It is necessary to stir the Beef
Rendang often during the last 30 minutes of cooking to prevent
coconut milk from separating and to avoid sticking. This distinctive
and delicious curry is cooked very slowly for a long time, until the
meat is very succulent and all the coconut milk has been absorbed. A
close friend of mine, Winnie Quek, and her husband own a fine
Singaporean Restaurant here in Calgary. While her recipe for Beef
Rendang remains a closely guarded secret, this one comes very close.
Winnie has suggested holding back 2 cups of coconut milk until the
last 30 minutes of cooking, then slowly adding it then, as you
continue to simmer and stir until all the liquid has been absorbed.
Winnie says that this will stop the coconut milk from separating and
tasting "oily". Source: Indonesian Cooking
