Categories: Salads
Yield: 6 Servings
4 c  Assorted salad greens
4 c  Mixed fresh fruit
1 c  Canned mandarin oranges
1 1/2 lb Boneless, skinless chicken
1/2 c  Cashews
2 c  Plain yogurt
1/2 c  Dried, shredded coconut
1 tb Liquid honey
1 tb Red wine vinegar
1 ts Coconut extract
2 tb Lemon juice
10 tb Salad oil
2 oz White wine
2 c  Chicken broth
To prepare dressing, in a medium bowl mix together thoroughly yogurt,
coconut, honey, vinegar, 8 tb cooking oil, coconut extract and lemon
juice. Refrigerate. In a heavy skillet, add remaining 2 tb cooking
oil and bring to medium high heat. When hot, add chicken breasts.
Saute, turning often, until just lightly brown. Remove the chicken
breasts from skillet. Chicken will not be cooked through. Wipe oil
from skillet and return pan to medium heat.  Add chicken, broth and
wine. Heat to boil, reduce heat and partially cover.  Simmer until
tender, about 12-15 minutes. Remove chicken and allow to cool to room
temperature. Cut into 1/2 inch cubes. Refrigerate. When ready to
serve, divide salad greens (cut into bite-size pieces) equally among
six individual bowls. Similarly divide and top the greens with the
fresh fruit, then the mandarin sections (drained), the cubed chicken
and the cashews. Dressing may be served on top of the salad or on the
side.
