Cut tops from pineapples.  With a sharp knife, hollow out fruit,
leaving about 3/4 inch pineapple on sides and bottom. (Be careful not
to cut through outside shells.) Dice 1 cup pineapple. (Use remainder
for salad or dessert)  Cook onions and garlic in cooking fat in large
frying-pan 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add ground beef, salt,
ginger, seasoned salt and pepper.  Cook over medium heat, stirring
occasionally, until ground beef begins to brown.  Warm brandy in
small pan over low heat, ignite and pour over beef mixture, lifting
pan from heat and shaking until flame dies.  Continue cooking for 8
to 10 minutes. Remove from heat; add 1 cup diced pineapple, orange
segments and mandarine liquer, stirring carefully to mix.  Fill
pineapple shells (barrels) with beef and fruit mixture.  Place filled
fruit upright in foil lined pan. Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees
F.) for 35 minutes. Meanwhile remove stemms from mushrooms, slightly
hollowing out caps. Cook caps in butter in small frying-pan about 3
minutes. Curl up each pimiento strip and place in mushroom cap.  To
serve, set both "Barrels" on warm plater, spoon beef mixture over
rice on individual dinner plates and garnish each serving with 3
stuffed mushroom caps.
