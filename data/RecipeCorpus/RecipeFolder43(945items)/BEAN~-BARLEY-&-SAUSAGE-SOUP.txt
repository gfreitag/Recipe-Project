1 lb Kidney beans, dry
1 pk Smoked polish sausage,sliced
7 c  Water
1 c  Barley
2    Garlic cloves; peeled
3    Bay leaves
Put rinsed beans in large saucepan. Add water, cover and let stand
overnight. Drain off water the next day. Put beans, barley and
remaining ingredients into crockpot.  Stir.  Cover and cook on high
for 4 hours. Remove bay leaves.  Salt to taste when serving.

Sylvia's comments:  I nuked the beans to fast-soak them, and it worked
great.  Even the kids liked this one! I used a fine-ground wurst
instead of Polish sausage and cut it into bite-sized pieces before
cooking. I also added some powdered beef stock to the water for
cooking. Then I packed the soup into empty jars to take to work. It
reheats great! Also worked well for a quick supper for the kids.
Definitely a keeper. I might add some chopped browned onions next
time, though.
