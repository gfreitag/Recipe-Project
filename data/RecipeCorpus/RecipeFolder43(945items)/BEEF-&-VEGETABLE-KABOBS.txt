Title: BEEF & VEGETABLE KABOBS
Categories: Barbecue, Beef, Vegetables
Yield: 8 -10 skewer
1 lb Top round steak; cut into
-1.5 inch chunks
1 md Spanish or vidalia onions;
-quartered and separated
3 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Dry sherry
1 tb Salad or olive oil
1 tb Chili sauce
1/4 ts Ground ginger
1 md Zucchini
1 md Straight-neck squash
1 md Red or green pepper
1/2 lb Medium mushrooms
1/2 lb Cherry tomatoes
3/4 c  Italian dressing
1. In a medium sized bowl, mix the first 7 ingredients. Cover mixture
and refrigerate at least 2 house, stirring occasionally.

2. About 1 hour before serving, prepare the grill for barbecuing.

3. Cut zucchini and yellow squash into 1 inch chunks. Cut pepper into
1 inch pieces. On long skewers, alternately thread zucchini, yellow
squash, peppers, tomatoes and mushrooms. (I usually  use only one
tomato and 1 mushroom  per skewer to keep the weight down.)

On separate skewers, alternately thread beef and onions. Save the
marinade for later.

4. Place vegetable and meat skewers on grill over medium heat. If you
have a 2-level grill, place the meat skewers on the lower level and
the vegetable skewers on the top level.

Cook about 10 minutes, brushing the meat and onions with the reserved
marinade and the vegetables with the Italian dressing. Turn skewers
several times while brushing frequently.( A good way to tell that the
vegetables are done is when the tomatoes start to split.)

This is a great meal  served with curried (or regular) rice and a
fresh fruit salad.
