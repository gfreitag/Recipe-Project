any excess flour from it, and fold the rectangle in thirds as before.
This completes 2 "turns". Chill the dough, wrapped in plastic, for at
least 3 hours and up to 3 days.

Author's Notes: This is a beef Wellington recipe that was in the
recent 50th anniversary issue of Gourmet Magazine. It impressed me
significantly because I rarely get to see a recipe that has both foie
gras and black truffles and looks doable by me. (Your requester in
the digest appears to be on the West Coast, so I'm sure he's got, or
can locate, sources for these delicacies. If he were on the East
Coast, I would recommend he contact D'Artagnan, in Jersey City, at
201-792-0748, for the foie gras and Urbani, in NYC, at 212-941-4710
for the black truffles. By the way, Daguin's daughter, the young lady
who knocked their socks off at the state dinner in Paris for
President Bush awhile ago when she served American foie gras, is
associated with D'Artagnan).

The dough may be frozen.
