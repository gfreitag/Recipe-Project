Soak beans four to eight hours. Cover with water in saucepan and bring
beans to a boil. Simmer 30 - 40 minutes. Heat oil, saute onion and
garlic until soft. Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, oregano, basil,
paprika and cooked, drained, beans.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat,
simmer 8 - 10 minutes. Add Coriander leaves. Pre-heat oven to 325 F.
Combine cottage cheese,  mozzarella and egg. In a greased lasagna pan
place a layer of noodles, a layer of bean mixture and a layer of

finishing with a layer of cheese on top.  Sprinkle Parmesan cheese
over top layer. Bake for 40 minutes at 325 F. * I use a mixture of
red, pink, baby lima, white, black-eyed and mung in whatever
proportion strikes my fancy. From: Dale Shipp
