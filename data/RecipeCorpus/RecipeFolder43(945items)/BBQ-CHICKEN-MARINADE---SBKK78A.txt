Categories: Bbq, Sauces, Marinade
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Good Sherry ***
1/2 c  Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1 ea Onion, Medium Minced
6 ea Garlic Cloves, Minced
1 tb Worcestershire Sauce
1 tb Dijon Mustard
1 tb Mixed Herbs
1/2 ts Pepper, coarse ground
1 ts Soy Sauce
1 tb Dry Vermouth
Mix all ingredients in deep dish or bowl..*** Amontillado sherry is
best for this.. remember use only good sherry... not over salted
cooking sherry.. if you cant drink it you shouldnt cook with it. This
is enough for about 2 lb chicken which should marinate in this for
several hours before it goes to the grill.. this can also be used as
basting sauce but watch out for flare ups of oil on hot coals... Ken.
