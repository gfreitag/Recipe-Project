Title: BEER BATTER HALIBUT
Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
-couple of pounds of
-halibut
-enough cooking oil to
-allow deep frying
1 c  Flour
-one 12-ounce bottle of
-beer
1 tb Of paprika and 1 1/2 tsp
-salt
For this batter, good quality, light-colored beers work best. The
flavor of dark beers is too strong.

Cut halibut into 1-inch-thick chunks. Heat oil in a deep-fat fryer to
375 degrees F. Make batter by combining remaining ingredients. Dip
the halibut into the batter and drop the pieces into the hot oil a
few at a time. Cook the fish chunks until the batter is golden brown
~ just a few minutes. Halibut overcooks easily, so try not to overdo
it. Remove the fish pieces from the oil and drain on paper towels;
serve piping hot with your favorite accompaniments.
