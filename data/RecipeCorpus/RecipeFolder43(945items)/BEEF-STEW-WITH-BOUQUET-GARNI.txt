hour. Remove beef and garlic from marinade with a slotted spoon,
reserving marinade. Pat beef and garlic dry on paper towels.

Beef Stew: In a 6 quart non-reactive oven-going pot, heat olive oil
and garlic over medium-high heat. Add meat in 2 batches, searing meat
on all sides until deep brown. Return all meat to pot. Pour in
reserved marinade and beef boullion. Add bouquet garni. Bring to a
boil. Boil gently for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer for 30
minutes.

Preheat oven to 350øF. Layer carrots, onions, turnips and mushrooms
atop meat mixture in casserole. Cover and bake at 350øF for 1 1/2
hours until meat and vegetables are tender. Remove bouquet garni.
Stir in frozen peas. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and
bake 4-5 minutes until peas are cooked. Spoon stew and cooking juices
into individual serving bowls. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.
