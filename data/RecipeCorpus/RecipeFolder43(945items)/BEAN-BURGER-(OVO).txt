Title: BEAN BURGER (OVO)
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Dry kidney beans
1 ts Curry
4 tb Cornstarch
4 tb Cornmeal
1    Onion, minced
Garlic to taste, I used four
Cloves, minced
1 tb Black pepper
2    Carrots, grated (acts as
Binder)
MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONS-------------------------------
2 tb Beef bullion and or
1*tablespoon soy sauce
2    Eggs (to act as a binder)
make up the beans, (slow overnight or faster boil & wait) then mash.
Add the spices, I added the vege beef bullion as I don't worry too
much about the salt. Form into patties ( make sure they are thin) and
fry in a non-stick pan. I found that mine took quite a while to cook
(too thick) but they turned out very good! Passed the taste test, my
8 year old just loved them.
