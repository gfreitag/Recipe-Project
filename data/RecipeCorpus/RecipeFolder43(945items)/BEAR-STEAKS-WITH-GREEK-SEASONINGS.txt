Title: BEAR STEAKS WITH GREEK SEASONINGS
Categories: Greek, Lamb, Game, Steaks, Jw
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Bear steaks
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Lemon juice
1 tb Garlic powder
1 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
1 ts Combination of oregano,
-marjoram, rosemary and/
-or mint
Trim all visible fat from the bear as it turns rancid rapidly.

Whisk the other ingredients together until emulsified. Use the
emulsion to marinate the meat for 2-3 hours, refrigerated. Longer
marinading before cooking does not improve the meat as the remaining
bear fat will go rancid despite refrigeration. Grill, broil or saute
the steaks until WELL DONE. Bear should always be thoroughly cooked
as a trichinosis precaution. Serve immediately.

Do not try making a gravy from the marinade as it will usually have
picked up a gamy taste from the bear meat.
