1/4 c  Pecan halves; chopped
1/4 c  Walnuts; chop coarse
1/4 c  Chocolate covered almonds;

Combine the coarsely chopped chocolate, pecans, walnuts and chocolate
covered almonds in a bowl, cover and refrigerate. Melt the unsweetened
chocolate in the top of a double boiler over hot, not boiling water.
Whisk in the milk, a little at a time, and heat, stirring constantly,
until smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool. Whisk the eggs in a
mixing bowl until light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes. Whisk in the sugar,
a little at a time, then continue whisking until completely blended,
about 1 minute more. Add the cream, vanilla and salt and whisk to
blend. Pour the chocolate mixture into the cream mixture and blend.
Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 1-3 hours, depending on your
refrigerator. Transfer the cream mixture to an ice cream maker and
freeze following the manufacturer's instructions. After the ice cream
stiffens (about 2 minutes before it is done), add the chocolate and
nuts, then continue freezing until the ice cream is ready. Makes one
Generous Quart.
