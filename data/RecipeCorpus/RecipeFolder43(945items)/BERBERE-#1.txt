Title: BERBERE #1
Categories: Condiments, Herb/spices, Ethiopia, Africa, Update
Yield: 3 Servings
10 ea Dried red chiles
1/2 ts Coriander seeds
5 ea Cloves
Seeds from 6 green cardamom
-pods
1/4 ts Ajowan seeds
8 ea Allspice berries
1/2 ts Black peppercorns
1/2 ts Fenugreek seeds
A small piece of cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground ginger
MMMMM---------------------------METHOD--------------------------------
Heat a heavy frying pan (without oil) and put in the chilies and other
whole spices after 2-3 minutes.  Dry roast over a medium heat until
they darken, stirring frequently to prevent burning. Leave the spices
to cool, then remove and discard the seeds from the chilies and
crumble the chilies into the mixture. Grind everything, including the
ginger, to a fine powder, and store in an airtight container for up
to four months. Most of these spices can be found at an Indian or
Middle Eastern market; hopefully there is one near you. The best way
to grind those spices is with a coffee grinder.  If you don't have
one of those handy, using a blender set on "liquify" works pretty
well too. I have tried grinding a batch of garam masala with a mortar
and pestle, and I had to give up and resort to a blender because it
would have taken me hours otherwise. Good luck with your Ethiopian
cooking ++ maybe you could see fit to post some of those recipes??
:^). Berbere is rather like Indian masala ++ a complex blend of
spices made
