Title: GARLIC MAYONNAISE
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 Recipe
1    Free-range egg
1 ts Dry mustard
Salt and pepper
300 ml Sunflower or olive oil

Crush the amount of garlic you require into the mayonnaise above, or
into a commercial brand, about 30 minutes before serving. It is best
eaten within 24 hours, because the garlic may turn slightly rancid
after a longer period.
