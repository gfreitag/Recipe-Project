Title: FRUIT SAUCE FREEZING TIP
Categories: Desserts, Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
For Desserts
If you use small amounts of a fruit sauce at a time, freeze the sauce
in plastic ice cube trays. Once frozen, pop out, wrap them airtight
in plastic freezer bags & put back in freezer. Individual serving of
fruit sauce will always be on hand. Submitted By THESERVS@GATE.NET
