Title: GARLIC BAKED POTATOES
Categories: None
Yield: 6 Servings
6 lg Potatoes, scrubbed
3 ts Olive oil
1 tb Fine chopped fresh rosemary
Ground black pepper
6    Cloves garlic, peeled, cut
-in half.
Preheat barbecue to med.  heat.  Using an apple corer, carefully
remove a plug from each potato, making sure not to go right through
the potato. Reserve the plugs.

Combine oil, rosemary and black pepper.  Fill hole in each potato
with two garlic halves and a little oil mixture. Cut off two-thirds
of each plug and discard. Replace remaining plug in potato and wrap
potatoes in aluminium foil.  Cook potatooes on barbecue for 1 hr. or
until tender. Serves 6.

I also have tried these using garlic or herb butters, they work very
well in the conventional oven.
