Title: GARLIC KIELBASA
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
4 ts Coarse (kosher) salt
1 3/4 ts Ground black pepper
3 tb Sweet Hungarina paprika
1 ts Dried marjoram, crumbled
1/2 ts Dried savory, crumbled
2 ts Finely minced garlic
10 oz Trimmed beef shin, cut into
-1/2" dice and chilled
16 oz Fresh pork fat, cut into
-1/2" dice and chilled
1/3 c  Ice water
1 1/4 lb Lean, trimmed pork, cut into
-1" dice and chilled
1. Mix together in a small bowl the salt, pepper, paprika, marjoram,
savory, and garlic. 2. In the container of a food processor combine
the beef, half the pork fat, half the ice water, and half the mixed
seasonings (see step 1) and process to a very fine grind (if you are
using a meat grinder, follow the directions on page 4). Scrape into a
mixing bowl. 3. In a bowl combine the remaining seasonings, the pork,
remaining pork fat, and remaining water. Process half of the mixture
at a time to a coarse grind and add to the beef. Mix together very
thoroughly, cover, and chill for 24 hours. 4. Stuff the sausage into
casings as indicated in the general sausage-making directions on
pages 4-5, tying links for 10 to 30 " long, depending upon your
preferance. Both sizes (and everything in between) are considered
traditional. Hang the sausages in a cool, airy place for several
hours at least, or until the skin is smooth, dry, and crackly. If
it's too hot or humid to hang the sausages, refrigerate them,
uncovered, for at least 12 hours. To store, refrigerate for up to 3
days, or freeze for longer keeping. TO COOK: Place one or more
sausages in a large skillet with water to come halfway up them. Bring
to a simmer and cook for about 8 minutes, then turn and cook for
about 8 minutes on the other side. Pour off the water, prick the
sausages, and cook them over moderate heat until browned on both
sides. Makes about 2-3/4 pounds
