The rice is quite crunchy and gives an interesting texture to the
gelato. This ice cream is very popular in Italy now.

Put the rice in a saucepan. Add the milk, vanilla bean, sugar, and
salt and brig to a boil over medium heat, stirring costantly. Then
simmer for about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the rice
cool completely (about 2 hours).

Pour the contents of the pan through a colander and drain off the
excess liquid. Let the rice sit in the colander for about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare the custard cream with the ingredients listed
above, following standard directions.

Transfer the rice to a large bowl and remove the vanilla bean. Then
add the cooled custard cream to the rice and combine well. Add the
heavy cream and confectioners' sugar and mix again.

Prepare the gelato, following ice-cream maker's directions.
