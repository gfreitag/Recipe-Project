CHEESE TART SHELLS: Combine the shortening and cheese spread in a
medium bowl.  Cut flour into the cheese mixture with two knives until
well blended.  Shape into a roll 1 1/4-inch in diameter and 12 inches
long. Wrap completely in waxed paper or plastic wrap. Refrigerate for
1 hour or longer.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the dough
from the refrigerator and unwrap. Slice 1/8-inch thick. Using 12 (2
3/4-inch) muffin cups or 3-inch tart pans, place 1 slice of dough in
the bottom of each. Overlap 5 slices around the outside of each.
Gently press together. Pierce the bottoms and sides with a fork.
Bake 18 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven until lightly browned.
Cool in the pans on a rack and gently remove the shells when cold to
the touch. FILLING: Cut each orange section into 3 pieces and set
aside.  Drain the pineapple, reserving the syrup. Combine the
pineapple syrup, orange juice, and lemon juice in a saucepan. Stir in
the rest of the ingredients except the cheddar cheese, and cook,
stirring gently, over medium heat until the mixture thickens and
bubbles. Stir in the orange pieces and pineapple. Refrigerate for at
least 1 hour. Spoon the chilled filling into the baked tart shells
and sprinkle each tart with about 1 Tbls of the cheddar cheese.
Refrigerate until serving time.
