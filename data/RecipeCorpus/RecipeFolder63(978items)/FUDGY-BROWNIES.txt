Title: FUDGY BROWNIES
Categories: Digest, Nov.
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 c  Unbleached flour
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2    Egg whites (egg replacer for
2 eggs)
1/2 c  Applesauce
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
1 tb Kahula
1 tb Peanut butter
x  Walnuts [opt]
Spray 8 x 8 pan w/ Pam.  In medium bowl, sift together cocoa, flour,
baking powder & salt.  (measure ingredients before sifting)

Combine peanut butter with kahlua warmed in the microwave. It will be
kind of gluey.

In large bowl, mix kahlua/pb with sugar. It will be kind of crumbly
and won't mix entirely.

Wisk in egg [replacer] , applesauce & vanilla. Combineflour mixture
w/ egg mixture.  (Add nuts, if using them) Bake 35-40 minutes @350!

NOTES:I had success with EnerG egg replacer. Also, this time I
replaced 1/4 cup of the flour with the same amount of the King Arthur
White Wheat. (Didn't want them to be too heavy)

1    Gram of Fat per Brownie One poster reports that he/she
eliminated the Kahlua and the recipe came out okay.
