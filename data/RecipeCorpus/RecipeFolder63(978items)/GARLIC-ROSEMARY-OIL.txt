Categories: Sauces, Oils
Yield: 1 Servings
3 lg Plump garlic cloves
1/2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
1    4" sprig fresh rosemary
-OR
1 ts Dried rosemary
1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
To make the garlic-rosemary oil, peel and cut the garlic into very
thin slices. Pour the oil into a small heavy skillet or saucepan, add
the sliced garlic and the rosemary, crushing the herb between your
fingers as you add it, and warm over low heat. When the aroma rises
and the garlic just starts to take on color (it should not brown),
about 5-7 minutes, remove from the heat. Add the salt to taste and
strain the oil into a small pitcher.

NOTE: The oil can be made up to 2 weeks ahead, cooled to room
temperature, and stored in the refrigerator in a tightly sealed
container. To enjoy the full flavor and fragrance of the oil, make
sure to bring it to room temperature before using.
