Title: GARAM MASALA 3
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
4 1/2 ts Cumin seeds
4 1/2 ts Coriander seeds
2 ts Black peppercorns
1    1 1/2 inch stick cinnamon,
Broken into small pieces
1 1/2 ts Cardamom seeds (remove them
From the pods)
1/2 ts Whole cloves
1. Heat a small heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
ingredients, and cook them, shaking the pan, for about 5 minutes or
until the spices are brown but not burned.

2. Transfer the spices to a bowl, and let them cool. In a mortar with
pestle or in an electric coffee grinder or in a spice grinder, grind
the spices to a fine powder. Store the garam masala in an airtight
jar.

Makes about 1/3 cup.

It comes from Jane Brody's Good Food Gourmet. at p. 247: "You can
prepare a reasonable garam masala by combining equal amounts of
cardamom, cumin, cinnamon, and coriander, and smaller amounts of
ground cloves and black pepper."

She also provides a "real" recipe for it at p.546 (above).

I have never bothered with the "real" recipe, but have just mixed in
the proportions given in the "easy" recipe, as needed. It's delicious
for all your garam needs!
