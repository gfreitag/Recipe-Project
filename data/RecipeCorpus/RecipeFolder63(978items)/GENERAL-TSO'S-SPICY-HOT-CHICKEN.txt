Pound chicken slightly with a mallet to tenderize; then cut into 3/4
by 3/4 inch pieces. Combine marinade ingredients with chicken in the
order listed; set aside. Combine sauce ingredients thoroughly; set
aside. To oil-blanch, set wok over high heat for about 1 minute. Add
2 cups oil and heat to 350 degrees. Add chicken and blanch for 3 or 4
minutes until golden brown. Remove and drain, reserving oil. To
stir-fry, remove all but 2 tablespoons oil from wok. Reheat, swirling
pan to coat sides. Add chili pods and seeds; stir-fry for about 30
seconds until browned. Return chicken and add seasonings, stir-frying
for another 30 seconds. Pour in sauce and cook until thickened. To
serve, stir in sesame oil. Note: Chili pods are browned to produce
the aroma while the seeds are used to make the dish spicy and hot.
Take care not to burn the seeds or let them get too dark.
