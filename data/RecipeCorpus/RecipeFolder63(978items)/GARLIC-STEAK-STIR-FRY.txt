Title: GARLIC STEAK STIR-FRY
Categories: Chinese, Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Round steak/venison
1/4 c  Light soy sauce
1 c  Beef bouillon
1/4 ts Ginger
2    Clove mashed garlic
1/4 c  Cooking sherry
4 tb Peanut oil
2    Clove chopped garlic
1 1/2 c  Boiling water
3 lg Green peppers cut into 1/2
Inch strips
1 c  Sliced water chestnuts
3 tb Cornstarch
Sherry or sesame oil
Hot boiled rice
Cut meat against the grain into 1/2 inch strips (this is easier to do
if meat is partially frozen). Make a marinade for the meat by
combining soy sauce, bouillon ginger, mashed garlic and sherry.
Marinate steak for 2-12 hours in the refrigerator. Dry meat on paper
towels. In a wok, heat peanut oil and saute chopped garlic until it
turns golden brown. Remove, leaving at least 2 tablespoon oil in wok.
Add meat to oil and saute until brown (add just a dash of
sherry/sesame oil to meat while it's browning). Add reserved marinade
and 1 cup boiling water. Simmer 45 minutes or less time, if desired.
When meat is tender, remove and keep in warm oven. Pour marinade in
separate pan and add cornstarch. Add remaining 1/2 cup boiling water,
if needed. Simmer until thick. Stir-fry green pepper and water
chestnuts in liquid remaining in wok. Add meat and marinade gravy.
Add dash sesame oil to taste. Serve over boiled rice.
