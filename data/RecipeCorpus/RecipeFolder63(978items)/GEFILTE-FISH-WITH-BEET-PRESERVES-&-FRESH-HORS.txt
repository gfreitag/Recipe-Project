To make the poaching liquid: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Combine all
the poaching liquid ingredients in a large pot. Bring to a gentle
simmer over medium-low heat. Simmer for 10-15 minutes.

To make the gefilte fish: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Combine all the
gefilte fish ingredients in a food processor; process for 15 seconds.
Use a small serving spoon to scrape out a spoonful of the mixture
against the side of the bowl.

Using another small serving spoon, shape the gefilte fish into a
dumpling by gently pushing the mixture off the other spoon and
dropping it gently into the summering poaching liquid. Continue until
all of the fish mixture has been made into dumplings.

Cook the gefilte fish until all the dumplings float to the liquid's
surface, about 10-12 minutes. Remove the pan from heat and let the
dumplings cool in their poaching liquid for 30 minutes at room
temperature.

Refrigerate until the broth has jelled, about 4 hours or overnight.

Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the dumplings from the jelled
broth and place on chilled plates. Serve with beet preserves, fresh
horseradish, julienned green onion and carrot.

BEET PRESERVES:

Combine all of the ingredients in a small pan and simmer gently over
medium heat for about 15-20 minutes, or until all the liquid has been
absorbed. Chill well before serving.

Makes 1/2 cup

FRESH HORSERADISH: Prepare at least one day in advance so its flavor
has time to develop.

Grate the horseradish with the water in a blender until very finely
shredded. Scrape down the blender's sides with a rubber spatula.
Strain off any excess liquid and transfer the horseradish to a bowl.
Add the salt and vinegar; stir to combine. Place in a clean jar,
cover, and refrigerate overnight. Serve cold.

Makes about 1/2 cup.

Note: To make horseradish in a food processor, fit the processor with
the fine grating disc. Peel and cut the horseradish so that it will
fit through the feed tube. Grate the horseradish in the processor and
transfer it to a bowl. Add the salt and vinegar. The water may be
omitted using this technique.

Store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to three days.
