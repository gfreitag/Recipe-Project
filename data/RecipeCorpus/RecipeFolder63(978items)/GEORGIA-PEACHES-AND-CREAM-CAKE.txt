Yield: 8 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 lb Ripe peaches; peeled
1/3 c  Sugar
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
MMMMM-----------------------CRUMB TOPPING----------------------------
1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
6 tb Light brown sugar
4 tb Unsalted butter; chilled
1/4 ts Cinnamon
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
6 tb Sour cream
1/4 ts Baking soda
1 lg Egg
1/3 c  Sugar
4 tb Unsalted butter; softened
1 1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
3/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F 15 minutes before baking, with the rack in the
center of the oven. Butter an 8-inch square baking pan, preferably
glass. Cut the peaches into 1/2-inch slices. Put in a pan with sugar,
lemon juice, tapioca and nutmeg and toss gently. Cook over high heat
until syrup begins to bubble, about 4 minutes. Set aside. FOR THE
TOPPING: Work the flour into the sugar, butter and cinnamon until the
butter is the size of small peas. This can be done with a food
processor or pastry blender. Set aside. FOR THE CAKE: Stir the sour
cream and baking soda together and let stand while you begin the
cake. Cream the egg, sugar and butter in the processor or with a
mixer until it is light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and sour cream
and mix well. Gently fold in the flour, baking powder and salt. In
the processor, do this by pulsing the machine on and off several
times. Spread the warm peaches and their juice in the bottom of the
baking pan. Spoon the batter over the peaches and spread in a thin,
even layer with a rubber spatula. It's OK if the peaches are not
completely covered. Sprinkle the topping over the batter. Bake until
a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake--not the
fruit--comes out clean, 25-to-28 minutes.
