This colorful cake is dazzling, but simple. Just follow the
directions for placing the colors and the colors will mix themselves.
Prepare the cake mix according to directions, or use your favorite
white cake recipe. Set aside three 1/2 cup portions of batter and
pour the remainder into a 9' by 11' pan that had been greased and
floured. To each of the 1/2 cup portions, add 3-5 drops of one food
color so that you have 1/2 cup each red, blue and yellow. Next, spoon
1/4 cup of each of the colored batters in the cake mix in the baking
pan, making a half circle. Then, repeat the procedure with the
remaining 1/4 cup portions (you should have a full circle of red,
blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow.) Using a knife, blend the colors
together with swirling strokes, so that the colors will touch and mix
into colors of the rainbow. Bake the cake as directed. Frost with
your favorite frosting or dust with confectioner's sugar.
