This is an easy way to infuse the pork with garlic. Thinly slice the
garlic horizontally. Use a thin boning knife to make 1-inch-deep
slits in the roast.

Unroll roast, and trim fat. Reroll the roast, and secure at 1-inch
intervals with heavy string. Rub surface of roast with vinegar. Make
several 1-inch-deep slits in the roast, and stuff with garlic slices.
Sprinkle salt and cracked black pepper over roast.

Place roast on a broiler pan coated with cooking spray. Insert meat
thermometer into the roast. Bake at 350 degrees for 2 hours or until
meat thermometer registers 160 degrees. Yield: 8 servings (serving
size: 3 ounces).
