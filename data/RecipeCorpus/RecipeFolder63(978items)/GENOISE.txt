Yield: 8 Servings
6    Eggs, at room temperature or
-warmer
1 c  Extra-fine granulated sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Cake flour; sifted
1/4 c  Butter
Recipe by: The New York Times Cookbook 1. Warm the bowl of an electric
mixer.  Beat the eggs with the sugar and vanilla at the highest speed
until the mixture stands in stiff peaks when the beater is withdrawn.
Depending on the power of the mixer, this should take from 5 to 30
minutes. It is important not to underbeat the mixture. Scrape the
sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula from time to time so the
ingredients will be well blended.

2.  Meanwhile grease two 9-inch or three 8-inch cake pans that are 1
1/2 inches deep.  Line the pans with waxed paper and grease the
paper. Melt the butter and let cool to luke warm. Set the oven
temperature at moderate 350F and place the rack in the lower third of
the oven.

3.  Divide the flour into 6 - 8 portions and sift over the egg
mixture a portion at a time.  Use a rubber spatula to fold it in
gently after each addition.

4.  Add the butter, about a teaspoon at a time, and fold it in gently
but completely.

5.  Turn the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 35 - 40
minutes. When done, the cake will rebound to the touch when pressed
gently in the center.

6.  Turn the cakes out onto a cooling rack, remove the paper and let
cool.
