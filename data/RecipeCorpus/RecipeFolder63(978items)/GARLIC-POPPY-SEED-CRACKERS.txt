2 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Sugar
1 1/4 ts Salt

2 lg Cloves garlic, pressed
1/3 c  Plus 1 Tablespoon vegetable
Shortening
1/3 c  Water
1    Egg, lightly beaten, for

"The ever-popular garlic imbues these crackers with an unmistakable
personality. They stand alone and also go well with cold, crisp
cucumber slices. 325~F. 30 to 35 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.

Stir together the poppy seeds, flour, sugar, salt, and pepper in the
food processor or in a large bowl. Add the garlic and mix well.

Cut the shortening into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse
meal. Blend in enough of the water to form a dough that will hold
together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/8 inch thick. With a cookie
cutter, cut into 2-inch circles and place on an ungreased baking
sheet. Prick each circle 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork. Brush
the tops with the beaten egg, if desired.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, turning over once after about 15 minutes.
Remove when the crackers are lightly browned and crisp. Yield: 50-55.

VARIATION: In place of the garlic, use 1/3 cup finely minced fresh
onion.
