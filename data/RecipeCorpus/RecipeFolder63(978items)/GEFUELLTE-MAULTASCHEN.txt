Title: GEFUELLTE MAULTASCHEN
Categories: German
Yield: 4 Servings
250 g  Flour (2 cups plus 3 1/2
-Tbsp)
2    Eggs
Salt
4 tb To 5 tb water
Stuffing:
500 g  Smoked meat, cooked and
-diced (a generous lb)
1    Kaiser-type roll, cubed and
-sauteed
Finely chopped onion greens
1    Pancake, diced
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Egg white (for sealing
-edges)
Dough:

The liquid the smoked meat has been cooked in makes a suitable broth.

Combine the flour, eggs, salt, and water into a pasta dough. Knead
well, and immediately roll out thin on a floured pastry board. Cut
the dough into 5-inch squares.

Make the stuffing by mixing the smoked meat, sauteed cubed roll, onion
greens, and diced pancake.  Add salt and pepper to taste. Put one
heaping tablespoon of this stuffing on each square of dough. Brush
the edges of the dough with egg white, and fold each square over,
into a triangle. With your fingers, press the edges of the dough
which should seal immediately. Put the 'Maultaschen' into barely
cooking salted water, and let them simmer for 5 minutes, turning over
the pasta once.

Carefully remove 'Maultaschen' from water, as they are very fragile.
Immediately transfer them to the hot broth, and serve.

Serves 4.
