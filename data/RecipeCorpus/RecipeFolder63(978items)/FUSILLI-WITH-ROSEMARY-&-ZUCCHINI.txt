Title: FUSILLI WITH ROSEMARY & ZUCCHINI
Categories: Salads, Pasta, Side dish, Mark's
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Fusilli
1/2 c  Zucchini, chopped into bite-
-- sized pieces
2 tb Rosemary, chopped
3 ea Garlic cloves, minced
1 md Tomato, diced
Salt & pepper
3 tb Olive oil
2 tb Red wine vinegar
Cook pasta until *al dente*.  About 1 minute before it has finished
cooking, add the chopped zucchini. Remove from heat & drain. Let cool
slightly.

While the pasta is cooking.  Whisk together the oil, wine vinegar,
salt, pepper & garlic.  Turn into a bowl & toss in the rosemary &
tomato. When the pasta & zucchini have cooked, toss with the
marinade. Let cool to room temperature & then lightly chill before
serving.

NOTE: Obviously, fresh rosemary is best for this dish, but it can be
made with dried.  I roughly crush the dried rosemary in a mortar &
pestle before using it.
