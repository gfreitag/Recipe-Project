This recipe was inspired by one using partridges that appeared in "The
Taste of Spain," by Camilla Jessel.

Season hens with salt and pepper. Heat a bit of oil in a large heavy
pan and brown the birds in it on all sides. Add garlic to pan and
stir until it takes on a pale color. Add vinegar, 2 cups of the
stock, the vermouth and onions and bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover
tightly and cook gently until birds are very tender, about 1 hour.

Heat remaining cup of stock in a pan large enough to hold the pear
halves. Add pears and poach until barely tender; remove with a
slotted spoon and keep warm. Add chestnuts to poaching liquid and
simmer until heated through; remove and keep warm.

Remove birds to a heated serving platter or plates. Strain cooking
liquid, return to heat and add grated chocolate, stirring until it is
a good sauce consistency. Pour over birds and garnish with pears,
chestnuts, the fried bread, a few raisins and some chopped parsley.

Note: To make fried bread, cut crusts from 4 slices of white bread,
then cut slices diagonally to make 8 triangles. Fry quickly in a
little hot oil until golden on both sides. Drain and keep warm.
