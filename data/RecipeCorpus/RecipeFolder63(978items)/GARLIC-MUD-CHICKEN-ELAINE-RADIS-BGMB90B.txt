Title: GARLIC MUD CHICKEN ELAINE RADIS BGMB90B
Categories: Chicken, Chinese, Main dish
3 lb Roaster Chicken
Yield: 4 Servings
3    garlic*
1 TB Cajun Spices
3/4 c  Olive oil -- **
1 c  All purpose flour**

Preheat oven to 325 *large heads of (about 50 cloves) **or as needed
As the coating hardens and bakes on the chicken, the flavors and
juices are all sealed in.. Best chicken you ever ate. Put peeled
garlic cloves in blender with 1/2 cup of olive oil and Cajun spices.
Blend until creamy consistency, add more oil if needed. Place the oil
and garlic mixture in a large bowl. Add flour slowly, mixing until a
very heavy, thick, smooth mud like consistency is achieved. With
string, tie the chicken wings and the legs tight against sides
ofcarcass. Using a spatula, completely coat chicken with Garlic Mud,
as evenly as possible, using it all. Fill in all crevices between
wings and legs. Place on a rack, breast side up, in a pan and put in
preheated oven. Roast whole chicken about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours or
until coating is browned well. If using cutup chicken, coat each
piece very well, place on a rack and roast for a shorter time, until
chicken coating is brown. Serve chicken with the cr! ! isp pieces of
Garlic coating .. I would suggest using a vertical roaster. It is a
wire stand that the chicken slips down on and is vertical. Set your
bottom rack as low as possible to accommodate in oven. Even a lower
heat setting with a longer roast time is even better. >>> This is a
modification of an old Chinese recipe called Beggers Chicken. They
used mud to encase it...Then put into a hot bed of coals to cook....
