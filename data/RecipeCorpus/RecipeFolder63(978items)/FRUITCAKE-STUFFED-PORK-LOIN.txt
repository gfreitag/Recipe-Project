Categories: Holiday, Pork, Meats, Cakes
Yield: 10 Servings
1/3 c  Chopped onion
1    Garlic clove, minced
1 tb Olive oil
3 c  Crumbled fruitcake
5 lb Boneless rolled pork loin
- roast
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
2 tb Dried thyme, divided
1 c  Apple juice
1/4 c  Bourbon
1/4 c  Honey
2 tb Butter or margarine
2 tb All-purpose flour
2 tb Bourbon
1/4 c  Whipping cream
COOK onion and garlic in olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat,
stirring constantly, until tender. Remove skillet from heat; add
fruitcake, and stir well.

REMOVE pork loin from elastic net. (There should be 2 pieces.) Trim
excess fat. Make a cut lengthwise down the center of each piece,
cutting to, but not through, bottom. Starting from center-cut of each
piece, slice horizontally toward 1 side, stopping 1/2 inch from edge.
Repeat on opposite side. Unfold each piece of meat so that it lies
flat.

FLATTEN to 1/2-inch thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin.

SPRINKLE salt, pepper, and 1 tb. thyme evenly over pork. Sprinkle
fruitcake mixture over pork.

ROLL each loin half, jellyroll fashion, starting with long side.
Secure with string, and place, seam-side down, in a shallow roasting
pan.

POUR apple juice and chicken broth around rolled pork loins in pan.

COMBINE 1/4 cup bourbon and honey. Brush lightly over rolled pork
loins. Sprinkle with remaining tablespoon thyme.

BAKE at 350F for 50 minutes or until meat thermometer inserted in
thickest portion registers 160F, basting with bourbon mixture at
20-minute intervals. Remove pork loins from pan, reserving pan
drippings; keep pork warm.

POUR pan drippings into saucepan; bring to a boil, and cook about
10-15 minutes until mixture is reduced to 1 cup. Set aside.

MELT butter in a heavy saucepan over low heat; add flour, stirring
until smooth. Cook 1 minute, stirring constantly. Gradually add
reduced drippings and 2-tbs. bourbon; cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly until mixture thickens and boils. Remove from heat; stir
in whipping cream. Garnish pork, if desired with fresh grapes,
kumquats, thyme sprigs, and canned crabapples. Serve sauce with
sliced pork.
