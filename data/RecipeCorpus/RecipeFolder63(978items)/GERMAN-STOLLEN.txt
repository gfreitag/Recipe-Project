1/2 c  Candied red cherries, halved
1/4 c  Currants
1/4 c  Candied citron, diced *
1/4 c  Rum
4 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
2    Yeast, active dry packages
1 c  Milk
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2    Eggs
1 tb Orange peel, finely shredded
2 ts Lemon peel, finely shredded
1/2 c  Almonds, blanched chopped
Confectioners' glaze **
* Candied citron or citrus peel, diced ** Confectioners' glaze or
powdered sugar ~ In a medium bowl combine raisins, cherries,
currants, citron or citrus peel, and rum.  Set aside.  In a large
mixer bowl combine 1-1/2 cups of the flour and yeast.  Heat milk,
butter, sugar and salt over low heat, stirring constantly until warm
(120F to 130F). Add to dry ingredients along with eggs and fruit
peels.  Beat at low speed of electric mixer for 1/2 minute, scraping
sides of bowl. Beat 3 minutes at high speed. Stir in fruit-rum
mixture, almonds and enough of the remaining flour to make a soft
dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead in enough of
the remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth
and elastic (5 to 6 minutes). Shape into a ball. Place in a greased
bowl, turning once. Cover. Let rise until double (1 hour). Punch
dough down. Divide in half. Cover and let rest 10 minutes.

On a lightly floured surface roll each half to a 10x8-inch oval. Fold
lengthwise in half so the top half overlaps to within 1/2 inch of the
bottom half. Press folded edge firmly. Place about 4-inches apart on
greased baking sheet.  Cover and let rise until double (45 minutes).
Bake in a 375F oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool.

Serve sprinkled with powdered sugar or spread with Confectioners'
Glaze and decorate with candied cherries. Makes 2 loaves.

CONFECTIONERS' GLAZE

milk, 1/2 teaspoon at a time, until spreading consistency.
