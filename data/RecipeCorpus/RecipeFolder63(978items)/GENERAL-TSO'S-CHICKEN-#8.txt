Cut the chicken into 3/4 inch cubes. In a bowl, beat the egg. Dip the
chicken pieces into the egg and then dip them to coat in the flour.
Set aside. Cut the bamboo shoots into 1/2 inch cubes. Seed the green
and red peppers and cut them into small cubes. Set aside. In a small
bowl, combine the water, soy sauce and cornstarch. Set aside. In a
wok or deep-sided, heavy-bottomed sauce pan, heat enough vegetable
oil to deep fry the chicken. Deep fry the chicken until golden brown,
about 10 minutes. Remove from oil and drain on paper towel. Deep fry
the peppers 10 seconds and remove. Heat the 2-3 tablespoons of oil in
the wok. Add chicken, peppers, garlic and ginger. Then add the
remaining ingredients including the bamboo shoots but not the
water-soy-cornstarch mixture and cook 2-3 minutes. Add the
water-soy-cornstarch mixture and simmer until sauce thickens.
Transfer to warmed dish and serve.
