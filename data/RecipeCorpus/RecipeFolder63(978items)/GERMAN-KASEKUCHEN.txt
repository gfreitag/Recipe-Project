2 c  Unbleached Flour; Sifted
4 tb Butter; No Margarine
1/2 c  Sugar; Granulated
1    Egg; Large

MMMMM-------------------------CHEESECAKE------------------------------
3 c  Cottage Cheese; 1 1/2 lbs

CRUST: In a large mixing bowl, blend all the ingredients, cutting in
the butter and working the mixture with your hands until it is well
mixed and workable.
Divide the dough into 2 equal portions.  Use one half to line the
bottom of a greased 9-inch springform pan, the other half to line the
sides of the pan.  Either roll out the dough or press it in with your
fingers.
Chill before filling. CHEESECAKE: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Press the cottage cheese through a sieve. Combine the cornstarch and
the baking powder and set aside.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the
cottage cheese with the sugar, eggs, lemon rind and vanilla. Beat
until very smooth. Add the dry mixture to the cheese and blend well.
Stir in the sour cream and raisins.  Pour the cheese mixture into the
prepared crust and bake for one hour, or until done. The center will
remain soft. Turn off the oven and prop the door open.  Allow the
cake to cool to room temperature. Serve at room temperature as well.
