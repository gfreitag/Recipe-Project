Title: GERMAN ELDERBERRY SOUP
Categories: Soups/stews, German
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/2 lb Elderberries
6 tb Cold water
9 c  Water
2 tb Lemon juice
Lemon rind
3/4 c  Sugar
4 tb Cornstarch
Wash berries and place in a soup kettle.  Add water and a twist or
two of lemon rind.  Cook until the berries are soft. Strain into a
bowl, pushing though as much of the pulp as possible. Return the
liquid to the kettle, bring to a boil, and remove the kettle from the
stove.

Combine the cornstarch, cold water, and lemon juice, pressing out all
the lumps.  Add to the soup, together with the sugar, and stir
thoroughly. Place over medium-low heat and cook, stirring constantly,
until thick and clear.  Adjust the sugar and lemon to suit your
taste. Serve hot or cold.
