Title: GARLICKY MUSHROOM CROÂ–TES
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 2 Servings
1 sm Onion; chopped very finely
40 g  Butter
175 g  Mushrooms
- chopped very finely
1    Garlic clove; crushed
2 tb Parsley, finely chopped
1 tb Parmesan, grated
2    Eggs
50 g  Fromage frais
Salt and pepper
2 lg Crusty rolls
25 g  Butter; melted
Crisp, golden bread shells enclose a mouth-wateringly smooth, light
filling of mushrooms and fromage frais with herbs. This starter is a
delight - no problem with leftovers here.

Cook the chopped onion in the butter gently for 4-5 minutes until
soft and translucent, then turn the heat up and toss in the chopped
mushrooms. Stir-fry so that they are well coated with the butter, and
cook for 3-4 minutes until they are crisp and hot. Turn the heat down
and stir in the garlic and parsley. Cook for a minute or so gently,
then add the Parmesan.

Beat the eggs thoroughly and scramble them lightly into the mushroom
mixture so that they are creamy, then cool. Mash the fromage frais and
combine with the mushroom mixture. Season to taste and leave to one
side.

Cut the rolls in half and scoop out the bread in the middle, leaving
the crusts as shells. Brush with melted butter and crisp in a warm
oven for 10 minutes. Pile the warm mushroom mixture into them and
serve at once.
