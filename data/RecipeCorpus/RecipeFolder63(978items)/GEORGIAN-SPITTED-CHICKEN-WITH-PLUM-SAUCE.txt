Wash chickens and wipe dry. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange,
skin side down, on a grill or broiler rack. Brush well with butter.
Put in a preheated broiler and cook under medium heat for 50 to 60
mins or until tender, brushing occasionally with butter. Turn a few
times during cooking. While chicken is cooking, combine plums,
garlic, coriander or parsley and red pepper in a sauce pan; season
with salt and pepper. Cook on the stove long enough to heat through.
To serve, arrange chicken on a platter and garnish with tomatoes and
cucumbers. Serve sauce separately to pour over chicken. NOTES : In
southern Russia, a favorite method of preparing poultry is to
serve either spitted or broiled chicken with a sauce made
:
with
green gooseberries, pounded walnuts, sourcream or fruits.
:
One of
the most typical sauces is tkemali, which is made with a
:
base of
wild or sour plums that grow only in the Georgian republic.
:
It
is not possible to duplicate the recipe outside of the
:
region,
but a good substitute can be attempted. This is an excellent
entree for an outdoor meal.
