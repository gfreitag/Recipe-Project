Cooking parchment
PREPARATION: Partially freeze chicken breast and slice it paper thin,
across the grain, into narrow strips.
Marinate chicken in the rest of the ingredients for several hours or
overnight. Cut cooking parchment into 4 inch squares. WRAPPING:
Position parchment with corners at top, bottom, left and right. Drop
about 1 tbsp. of filling on lower corner of parchment. Tuck lower
corner under filling and fold parchment about 1/2 way up. Fold left
and right corners toward center, flatten filling and fold parchment
paper once toward top corner. Tuck in top corner. COOKING: Heat oil
in wok. Drop wrapped chicken in oil and fry for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes at
the most. Drain on paper towel and serve hot. DO-AHEAD NOTES: Deep
fry, cool and freeze. To reheat, preheat oven at 350 degrees. Heat
frozen packets for 7-8 minutes. COMMENTS: Foil may be substituted if
parchment paper is unavailable. You may also use cellophane paper,
and that's quite pretty as the filling shows through clearly. The
advantage of using the parchment paper is that the chicken pieces
will not stick to the wrapper. If you prefer to serve fresh, wrap the
filling several hours ahead and deep-fry at the last minute. Source:
