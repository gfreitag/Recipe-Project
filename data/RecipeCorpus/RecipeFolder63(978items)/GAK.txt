Gak Synthesis
Pour Solution A into Solution B.  Do not mix. Carefully scoop us the
GAK from the reaction solution and gently knead it. Carefully knead
it since there will be pockets of colored reaction solution that have
a tendency to "splurt" out at the most inopportune moment!!! Knead
until the GAK no longer feels slippery with water/solution. Enjoy-
This stuff is fun to make. For colors that are more intense, you
might consider using paste-type colorings which can be found in cake
decorating sections at cooking type stores.
