Yield: 8 Servings
3 tb Brandy
1/2 c  Golden raisins
12 oz Semisweet chocolate
7 oz Unsalted butter
5    Eggs; separated
1 lb Puff pastry
2 c  Sugar
16    Cream puffs, filled
-(with pastry cream)
2 c  Whipping cream
To plump raisins, heat brandy and raisins over low heat. Set aside to
soak. Chop 9 ounces chocolate in small pieces. Melt with butter in
top of double boiler over barely simmering water. When melted, remove
immediately and whisk in egg yolks. Add plumped raisins. Beat egg
whites until soft peaks form. Fold into chocolate-raisin mixture.
Cover and chill 3 to 4 hours or overnight. Roll puff pastry into
12-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Pierce with fork. Let rest 25
minutes. Place on baking sheet and bake at 450F until golden brown,
about 15 to 20 minutes. Caramelize sugar in heavy skillet until
golden brown. Do not overbrown. Remove immediately from heat. Using
fork, quickly dip one half of each cream puff into caramel and place
on buttered parchment paper. When caramel has set, dip uncoated half
in caramel. Cool. Place caramel-coated cream puffs around puff
pastry. Fill center with chilled chocolate filling. Melt remaining 3
ounces chocolate. Whip cream until soft peaks form. Fold melted
chocolate into half of whipped cream. Set aside. Spoon remaining half
of whipped cream into pastry bag fitted with a large round tube. Pipe
dome-shaped balls in rows over chocolate filling, leaving spaces
between rows. Repeat, using chocolate whipped cream, filling in
spaces between rows of white whipped cream to create stripes. Makes
one 12-inch cake
