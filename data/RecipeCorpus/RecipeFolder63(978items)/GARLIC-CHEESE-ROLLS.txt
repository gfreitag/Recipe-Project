Ingredients above are for a 1.5 pound loaf pan, although since these
rolls are made on the dough cycle, I find that I can put the 1.5
pound amount of ingredients in the 1 pound machine with no problem
since it's not going to bake.  1 pound ingredients are listed below.
Place roll ingredients into bread machine on dough setting and press
start. When dough is finished, remove from machine. Turn out dough
onto a floured countertop or cutting board.  Gently roll and stretch
dough into a 24 inch rope.

Greast an 8-inch pie pan.

With a sharp knife, divide dough into 18-24 pieces. Shape into balls
and place into pie pan. In a small bowl, combine butter and garlic.
Pour over rolls. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Cover and let rise in
warm oven 30-45 minutes until doubled. Remove rolls from oven.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Put rolls in oven, bake for 10-15
minutes until golden on top. Remove from oven, cut apart and spread
with butter to get "yummies" in your tummies!
