Title: GERMAN CABBAGE SALAD
Categories: Salads, Germany, German
Yield: 8 Servings
1    Cabbage, shredded
1/4 lb Bacon
2 c  Onion, chopped
1/2 c  Vinegar, cider
Cut the bacon into tiny bits, fry it in a big deep frying pan, and
fish out all the bits after they are crisp. Cut up the onion and
garlic and fry them in the bacon fat. When they are brown, pour in
the vinegar.

Bring it just up to a simmer, add all the cabbage and bacon, toss it
as you would a salad, and serve it. The cabbage doesn't cook, but it
wilts a little under the hot vinegar.

NOTES: Cut the vinegar with a little water if you don't like very sour
things,
