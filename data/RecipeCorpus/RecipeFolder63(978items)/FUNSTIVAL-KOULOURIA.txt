Cream butter with sugar in an electric mixer, adding sugar slowly.
Beat 20 minutes or until the consistency of whipped cream. Add
vanilla, then eggs one at a time. Beat well after each addition. Take
from mixer. With a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, fold in 4 cups of
flour sifted together with baking powder. Knead in remaining flour,
1/2 cup at a time, until a soft non-sticky dough is achieved. If
large eggs are used, a little more flour may be needed.  Pinch off
dough the size of a walnut and roll pencil thin, fold in half side by
side and twist. Brush with beaten egg yolk and press sesame seeds on
each piece. Place on cookie sheets and bake at 350 degrees for 30
minutes or until golden brown.

Makes 50 to 60 cookies.
