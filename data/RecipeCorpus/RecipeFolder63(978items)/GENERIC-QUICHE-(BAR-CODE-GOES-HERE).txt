Title: GENERIC QUICHE (BAR CODE GOES HERE)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Grated Cheese
1 c  Half & Half
4 lg Eggs
1    Unbaked Pie Shell
1 c  Filling
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Herbs (your choice)
1/8 ts Black pepper
Preheat oven to 350F.  Beat the eggs.  Brush pie shell with beaten
egg and pre-bake for 5 minutes. Allow to cool for a couple of
minutes. Combine cheese and filling material and place in pie shell.
Dust with salt, pepper and herbs. Combine half & half and eggs and
pour over all. Leave a little room for expansion. Bake 30-40 minutes
(golden brown and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean).
Allow to rest for about 10 minutes before serving. It is a good idea
to place your pie pans on a cookie sheet just in case this boils over.

Re:  measurements.  Since you generally buy a dozen eggs, frozen pie
shells come two to a pack, half and half is sold in Pints and it is
easy to buy a big enough brick of cheese, I usually double this and
make two quiches. They freeze well and make great leftovers and are a
wonderful breakfast.

Re:  fillings ... anything you want.  Suggest spinach, chopped
brocoli, onion, green pepper, crab, shrimp, sausage, bacon, ham,
turkey, etc.
