Drain, reserving about 1/2 cup of the cooking water. Transfer pasta
to a large warm bowl. Add sauce and toss to coat. Add all but 1/4 cup
cheese and toss again, adding a little of the reserved cooking water
if needed to thin the sauce√∫ Serve immediately on warm dishes,
topping each portion with some of the remaining cheese and parsley.
