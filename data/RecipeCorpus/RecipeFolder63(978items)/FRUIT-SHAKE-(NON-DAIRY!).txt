2 c  Fruit; frozen
1 tb Syrup, maple
Use raw almonds. Freeze strawberries, bananas, blueberries, peaches,
or fruit of your choice. Place almonds in blender and grind to fine
powder. Add syrup and 1 c water. Blend 1-2 minutes until smooth. With
blender running on high, slowly add remaining water. Blend 2 minutes.
Place strainer over large bowl. Line with cheesecloth (not 100%
neccessary, but recommended. Otherwise strain twice with very fine
strainer.) Pour almond milk slowly into strainer and let filter
through. When all milk has passed through strainer, press remaining
milk out of accumulated almond fiber. Milk will keep in fridge 4-5
days. Leftover fiber can be used as moisturizing body scrub in the
shower. Blend almond milk and shake ingredients in blender until
creamy. Frozen bananas will begin to discolor after a week or so. Eat
shakes right away, because the bananas can oxidize, changing the
appearence and taste. Use only ripe bananas for the best shakes.
