This fragrant, wonderful version of fried chicken serves two to three
people, but quantities can be adjusted to serve more. Adapted from
Thai Cooking by Jennifer Brennan (Jill Norman and Hobhouse Ltd.,
1981).

Using a mortar and pestle, grind or pound garlic, pepper corns and
coriander roots to a paste. Wash the chicken and pat dry. Rub the
paste all over the chicken and let stand to marinate for at least 30
minutes. Heat the oil in a wok to 375 degrees and deep-fry the
chicken until golden and tender. Serve hot with rice and Sweet and
Hot Chili Sauce.
