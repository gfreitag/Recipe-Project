1/4 lb Red onion, mild -- finely

1. MAKE GARLIC PASTE - Combine garlic and olive oil in a 12-inch
skillet (nonstick).  Stir occassionally over medium-low heat until
garlic is golden brown and soft when pressed, about 15 minutes. As
cloves brown, transfer from pan with a slotted spoon. Discard all but
1 tablespoon of the cooking oil. Return garlic to pan and mash with a
fork or potato masher.

2. SALSA and MASHED BEANS -  In a bowl, mix red and yellow tomatoes,
red and green onions, chili, cilantro, and lime juice. Drain beans,
but about a quarter of them on a rimmed plate or shallow bowl. Drain
liquid from tomato salsa mixture onto the plate. Mash the beans on
the plate to a smooth paste, then stir in remaining whole beans.

3.  Cut baguette in half lengthwise; broil halves 3 to 4 minches from
heat until bread is lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Spread halves
equally with garlic paste. Return to broiler about 10 seconds to warm
slightly. Cut bread into 8 equal pieces and put 1 or 2 pieces on each
plate. Mound bean mixture on bread, then top with the tomato salsa.
Salt and pepper as wanted.

Serve from 4 to 8.  Maura Devlin, "Food and Entertaining"

Pat's Notes: I used 1/3 cup garlic spread (Price Club), warmed first
in the micro at 70% 2 minutes; stirring in the oil after 1 minute. No
yellow tomatoes so used yellow bell pepper pieces.
