be surprised at how delicious they are. Like garbanzo beans

20 to 25 minutes Preheat oven to
to a fresh green salad. 325~F.
325~F.

Combine the flours, salt, and sugar in the food processor or in a
large bowl. Cut in the shortening until the mixture is the
consistency of coarse meal. Blend in the water to form a dough that
will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, no more than 1/8 inch thick.
Using a rolling pin, spatula, or your hands, lift the rolled dough
onto a large, ungreased baking sheet. With a sharp knife, score into
2-inch squares without cutting all the way through the dough. Prick
each square 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 10 minutes. Glaze with the oil and lightly salt the tops.
Bake for 5 to 10 minutes more, or until golden brown. Cool on a wire
rack. Break into individual crackers when cool. Yield: 60-65.

VARIATIONS: Any bean flour can be used. Purchase it at specialty or
health food stores. Lima bean and black-eyed pea flours work well.
