Title: GARLIC JAM
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Batch
4    Garlic head, whole (~14 oz)
1 tb Olive oil, extra-virgin
1 md Onion; unpeeled & halved
-lengthwise
Salt (opt)
Preheat the oven to 350F. Using a large sharp knife, cut off 1/2-inch
from the top of each head of garlic to expose some of the flesh.

Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the oil over the bottom of a gratin or glass
pie dish.  Place the garlic and the onion halves cut sides down in
the dish, cover tightly with foil and bake for 45 minutes, until very
soft to the touch.  Uncover and let cool for 20 minutes.

Peel the onion halves and finely chop them.  Place in a medium bowl.
Squeeze the garlic pulp from the skins into the bowl; discard the
skins. Using a fork, stir in the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and mash
with the onion and garlic until thoroughly incorporated. Season with
salt if desired. (The garlic jam will keep refrigerated in a glass
jar for up to 2 weeks.)

Makes 1-1/3 cups.

Use this condiment with roasted meats or as a spread for toasted
croutons or cold meat sandwiches, or try a spoonful of it mixed into
homemade salad dressings and sauces.
