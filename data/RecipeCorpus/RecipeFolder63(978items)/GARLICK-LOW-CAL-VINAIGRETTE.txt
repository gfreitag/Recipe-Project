Put the garlic cloves into a small saucepan and pour enough water to
cover them. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer until
garlic is quite tender...about 15 minutes. Increase the heat and
reduce liquid to about 2 T; 3 or 4 more minutes. Pour the contents
into a small sieve over a bowl and with a wooden spoon, mash the
garlic through the sieve into the bowl. Whisk the vinegar into the
garlic mixture; incorporate the oils and seasoning. Great tossed over
Boston or Bibb lettuce. E. Radis
