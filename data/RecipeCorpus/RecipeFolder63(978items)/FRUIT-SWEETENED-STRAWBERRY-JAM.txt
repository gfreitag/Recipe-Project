Title: FRUIT-SWEETENED STRAWBERRY JAM
Categories: Jams/jelly, Fruit, Condiments
Yield: 1 Cup
2 c  Sliced fresh strawberries
1/3 c  Apple-grape concentrate
(see separate recipe)
2 tb Water
2 tb Orange juice
1. In a medium pan combine the strawberries, apple-grape sweetener,
water and orange juice.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat slightly
and cook at a low boil 10 to 15 minutes, until very thick. Stir
often. (To test for gelling, put about 1/2 teaspoon jam on a chilled
saucer and place in freezer for 1 minute.  If, when cooled, jam
wrinkles when touched, it is done.) Skim the foam from the top of the
jam.

2. Transfer to a bowl, cool, cover, and refrigerate.
