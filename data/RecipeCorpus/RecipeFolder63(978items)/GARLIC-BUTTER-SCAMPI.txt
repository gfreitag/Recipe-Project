NOTES:

*  I serve this over fettucini (1 1/2 lbs for a full batch). To save
the trouble of de-veining shellfish, you can have two or three big
ones for each person, and use small bay shrimp for the remainder.

*  This recipe comes from the "Garlic Lovers' Cookbook," published by
the Gilroy Garlic Festival, P.O. Box 2311, Gilroy, California, USA.
North America mail order price is $9.45 (paperback) or $12.45
(spiral) for each of the 2 volumes.

: Difficulty:  Moderate.
: Time:  45 minutes cooking, 1 1/2 hours for de-veining scampi, 10
minutes for other preparation.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
