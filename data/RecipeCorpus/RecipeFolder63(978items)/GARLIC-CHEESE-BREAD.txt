1/2 c  Unsalted butter

PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Using a sharp, serrated knife, cut the
bread down to--but not through--the bottom crust, making slices about
1-inch thick. Cream the butter with the garlic, cheese, marjoram,

mixture. Wrap the bread in a large square of heavy-duty aluminum foil
and bake it for 45 minutes. Unwrap the bread and serve while very hot.
