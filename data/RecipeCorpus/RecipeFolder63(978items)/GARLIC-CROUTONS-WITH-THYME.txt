magazine Garlic Croutons with Thyme

Rub a small heavy skillet with the cut side of the garlic and in it
cook the garlic in the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, for
5 minutes, or until it is golden. Discard the garlic, add the bread
cubes and the thyme, and cook the croutons, tossing them, until they
are toasted lightly. Sprinkle the croutons with salt to taste and
transfer them to paper towels to drain.

Makes about a cup.
