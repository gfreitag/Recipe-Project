farina. beat 10 minutes until fluffy. Beat eggs separately until
fluffy. Slowly beat some milk mixture into egg mixture on medium
speed and return all egg mixture into milk mixture and blend well.
Slowly cook mixture on low heat, stirring constantly until thick,
about20 minutes. cool completely and chill. Mixture will be thick and
creamy. Assemble: butter 6 whole filo sheets and overlap each in a
buttered 9 x 13 pan so part of filo laps over edges of pan. Spread on
all of filling. Flip edges of filo over to cover filling. Cover with
6 more buttered filo sheets and overlap and cover as before.Work
quickly so filo doesnt dry out. Score 2/3rds through filo prior to
baking. Bake in a 350 oven for 20 to 30 minutes or golden. Prepare
the syrup by boiling all for 10 minutes. Pour hot syrup over cooled
pastry. This is a very special Greek pastry.
