Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
2 sm Chickens 21/2- 3 pounds cut
Into peices
1    Lemon -- cut in half
6    Cloves garlic -- crushed
1 tb Cayenne
2 tb Paprika

Rub the Chicken pieces with the lemon halves. In a small bowl, mash
the garlic with the cayenne and paprika to form a paste. Rub over the
chicken pieces. Place the pieces skin side up on a rack in a shallow
pan. Let stand in a cool place (do not refrigerate) uncovered for 24
hours. Preheat the grill. If using presoaked wood chips or chunks
(chips for gas), or other flavorings, spinkle over the hot coals or
lava rocks. Brush the grill lightly with oil.

Place the dark meat of the chicken on the grill and cover-cook with
the vents open over hot or high heat, turning once for 15 min. Add
the white meat to the grill and continue to cover-cook, turning once,
until both meats are crisp and the juices run yellow when pricked
with a fork, 15 - 20 min. longer . Sprinkle with salt and pepper
before serving.
