Title: GATEAU DE RIZ (RICE PUDDING)
Categories: Rice, Dessert, Pudding, Rice
Yield: 4 Servings
1/3 c  Raisins
1/4 c  Dark rum
6 c  Milk
1 c  Short grain white rice, such
As Arborio
1 1/2 c  Plus 1 T sugar
1    Vanilla bean, split
4    Eggs, separated
Creme Anglaise (optional)
Soak raisins in rum in a bowl for 1 hour.  Combine milk, rice, 1/2 c
sugar, and vanilla bean in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over
medium heat, reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook, stirring
occasionally, until rice absorbs all liquid, about 1 hour. Remove
from heat, scrape seeds from vanilla bean into rice, discard pod. Set
aside to cool to room temperature.

Pour 1 c sugar into a skillet (shake so the sugar spreads evenly) and
place over medium-high heat. Cook, without stirring, until sugar
begins to melt, about 2 minutes, then stir with a wooden spoon until
golden and just beginning to foam, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat
and carefully pour into a 9" baking pan, and (working quickly) tilt
to cover bottom and sides.

Preheat oven to 375.  Stir egg yolks and raisins (discard rum) into
rice. Beat egg whites until foamy. Slowly add 1 T sugar, beat until
soft peaks form, then fold into rice mixture. Transfer to caramelized
pan. Set pan in a shallow pan of water (bain marie) and bake until a
knife inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool
slightly in pan, then turn out onto a platter.  Swerve with creme
anglaise if desired.

(Picture of finished product and one serving in magazine shows the
pudding has been cut into a wedge shape, like you'd cut a piece of
pie)
