Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter 3 round layer pans, 8 or 9 by1 1/2
inches, or 2 square pans, 8x8x2 inches or 9x9x2 inches. Line bottoms
of pans with wax paper and butter paper. Pour 2 cup of boiling water
over chocolate, stirring until chocolate is melted; set aside to
cool. In large mixing bowl beat butter and sugar together until
light. Add egg yolks, 1 at a time, beating after each addition.
Slowly blend in melted chocolate and vanilla.

Blend together flour, soda and salt. Alternately mix flour mixture and
buttermilk into butter mixture, beating after each addition until
batter is smooth. Fold in egg whites and then pecans. Divide batter
among prepared pans. Bake until top springs back when touched
lightly: 8-inch round layers, 35 to 40 minutes; 9-inch round layers,
30 to 35 minutes; 8-inch squares, 45 to 50 minutes; or 9-inch
squares, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool in pans on wire racks. Remove from
pans.

Make frosting: In a very heavy saucepan combine evaporated milk,
sugar, egg yolks, and butter. Cook and stir over medium heat until
thick, about 12 minutes. It should have come to a gentle boil. Stir
in vanilla, coconut and pecans. Beat with a mixer until thick and
cold enough to spread.

Put strips of wax paper around outside edge of a serving plate. Put
bottom layer of cake on top, with paper extending out. Spread
frosting on each layer and on top of cake. Remove wax paper before
serving.

Yield: 1 cake.
