Pick over the ingredients and remove any husks or strawy bits. Grind
together in a blender or finely adjusted coffee grinder. Do not make
the mixture too fine. Stor in an airtight container and keep for use
in the recipes.

goes well with meat, fried and braised foods. Try it sprinkled on
fried potatoes, with a pinch of tumeric. Sprinkle a lttle on yogurt,
sour cream and curd cheeses.
