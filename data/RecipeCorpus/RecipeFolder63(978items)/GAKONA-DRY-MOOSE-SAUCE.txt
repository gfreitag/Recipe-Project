The moose that is taken late in the season & destined to feed many
Alaskan families is often a dry & lean animal. To lovers of fat beef,
late-season moose isn't much of a treat. While living in Flennallen
one winter, we learned from a family in Gakona how to make a sauce to
eliminate some of the problem. It's good on fat moose or beef, too.

In frying pan over medium heat bring fat to hot. Combine all
vegetables except mushrooms in a bowl & salt & pepper to taste. Pour
them into hot grease & saute for 3 mins. Add water & bring to a boil.
Cook for 10 mins, stirring occasionally. Drain mushrooms, add them to
sauce & heat for another 2 mins. Add extra liquid if mixture appears
too dry. Serve either on or beside meat.
