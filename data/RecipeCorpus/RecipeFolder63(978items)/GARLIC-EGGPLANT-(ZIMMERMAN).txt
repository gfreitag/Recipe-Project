1 1/2 lb Eggplant, cut into
1/2    "cubes
1 lg Onion, chopped
MMMMM------------------IN A BOWL, MIX TOGETHER-----------------------
2 tb Soya sauce (or tamari)
2 ts Sesame oil (optional)
1/3 c  Water

MMMMM---------------------POUR IN HEATED WOK--------------------------
3 tb Olive oil (or veg broth)
8    Cloves minced garlic
1 tb Chili paste with garlic (or
Plain chili paste)
1/2 ts Minced ginger (I usually use
More than this)
Cook for a few seconds, stirring constantly. Add eggplant and onions.
Pour liquid mixture over eggplant and toss. Add more water so that
liquid measures 1/2 way up the mixture. Cover and cook on high heat
for @7 minutes. When eggplant is tender, uncover and cook until most
of the remaining sauce has evaporated. Serve with rice.
