2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Sugar
6 tb Cold butter,
-cut in small pieces

A little heaver than plain scones.  Make them slightly smaller than
normal and serve without jam or cream.

Preheat oven to 425F (220C).  Lightly grease a large baking sheet; set
aside.  Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large
bowl. Stir in sugar. With your fingers, rub in butter pieces until
mixture is crumbly.  Mix in raisins.  With a form, stir in egg,
yogurt and lemon peel and blend well to make a dough that BARELY
holds together (you may need to press dough together with your
hands).  Turn out onto a floured surface. Roll out with a floured
rolling pin or pat dough with your hands to make a round about
1/2-inch thick.  Cut in rounds with a 1 1/2 inch fluted or plain
cookie cutter.  Place 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheet; brush
tops lightly with milk. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until scones are
well risen and golden.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 5
minutes. Split and serve warm with butter. Makes about 18 scones.
