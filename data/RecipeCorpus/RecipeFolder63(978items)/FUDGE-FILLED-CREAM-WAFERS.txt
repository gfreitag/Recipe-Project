MMMMM-----------------------FUDGE FILLING----------------------------
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
1 c  Powdered sugar
1 ts Vanilla  or dark rum
2 tb Hot coffee or water
Preheat oven to 375'F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper or
leave ungreased. Place flour in large bowl. Using electric mixer,
blend 3/4 butter into flour until it forms pea-size pieces. Drizzle
cream over the butter mixture; toss by hand just until mixed (mixture
will look curdled).

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface; press together to form
ball. (If dough is too soft to handle, cover and refrigerate until
firm.) Roll out dough, 1/3 at a time, to 1/8" thickness on lightly
floured surface. Cut out with 1 1/4" round cutter. Dip top of each
dough circle in granulated sugar. Place sugared side up, 2" apart, on
prepared cookie sheets. Pierce each cookie with fork.

Bake 9-11 minutes or just until edges are very lightly browned.
Remove to wire racks to cool. Prepare Fudge Filling. Spread filling
on bottoms of half the cookies. Top with remaining cookies, bottom
sides down, forming sandwiches.

Makes about 10 dozen sandwich cookies.

FUDGE FILLING: Melt 1/4 cup butter and chocolate in small bowl over
hot water. Stir until smooth. Blend in powdered sugar and vanilla.
Stir in coffee until filling is spreadable, but not too soft.
