Categories: Breads, Diabetic
Yield: 12 Lg muffins
MMMMM-----------------------FRUIT AND NUTS----------------------------
3/4 c  Pecans
1/2 c  Date pieces
2 1/2 c  Chopped peaches
MMMMM----------------------WET INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1/2 c  Fruit sweetener
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Oil
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 ts Peach extract
1 1/4 c  Unsweetened applesauce
1 c  Oat bran
3/4 c  Rolled oats
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
2 1/8 c  Brown rice flour
1/3 c  Oat flour
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Nutmeg
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly spray a regular size muffin tin
with lecithin spray. Toast the pecans in the oven for 7-10 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool. Then coarsely chop
them with a knife or with a pulsing action in a food processor.
Coarsely chop the peaches. In a medium size bowl, mix together the
fruit sweetener, eggs, oil, vanilla, peach extract and applesauce.
Stir in the oat bran and the rolled oats. Let this mixture sit for a
minimum of 10 minutes while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl, stir in the pecans and
the date pieces. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients,
and stir in the wet mix. When half mixed, stir in the chopped
peaches. Be careful not to over mix, the muffin batter should be
lumpy. Use a #12 (1/2 cup) scoop to place the batter into the
prepared muffin tins. Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for
35-40 minutes. Let the muffins cool in the muffin pans before
removing them. Be extra careful when handling these muffins because
they are very fragile when warm.
