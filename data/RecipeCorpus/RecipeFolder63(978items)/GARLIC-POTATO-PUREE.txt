Title: GARLIC POTATO PUREE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
2    Heads garlic
2 lb Red potatoes, small
3 tb Chopped parsley
2 tb Butter
Salt
8 tb Milk or cream
Additional butter (optional)
Freshly ground pepper
SEPARATE THE GARLIC CLOVES and remove their papery husks. Slice each
clove into halves or, if large, thirds. Peel the potatoes (unless
they are newly harvested), quarter them and slice thinly. Put the
garlic, potatoes, parsley and butter in a small sauce- pan, add water
to cover by 2 inches and lightly salt. Bring to a boil, lower the
heat, and simmer, partially covered, until the potatoes and garlic
are soft and the water has cooked away, about 25 minutes. Pass the
potatoes and garlic through a food mill. Don't use a food processor
or blender as it will give the puree a gooey, unpleasant texture. If
you don't have a food mill, mash the potatoes by hand, then work them
through a strainer for a smooth texture or leave it a little rough
and irregular. Stir in the milk or cream and additional butter, if
desired. Add salt to taste and season with pepper.
