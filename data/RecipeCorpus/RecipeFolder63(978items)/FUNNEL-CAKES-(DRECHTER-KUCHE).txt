2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Sugar
3 c  Flour
--extra cup if needed

Beat eggs and add sugar and milk. Stir half the flour, salt and baking
powder together and add to milk and egg mixture. Beat the batter
smooth and add only as much more flour as needed. Batter should be
thin enough to run through a funnel. Drop from a funnel into deep,

madw by swirling and criss-crossing while controlling the funnel
spout with a finger. Serve hot with molasses, tart jelly, jam or
sprinkle with powdered sugar.
