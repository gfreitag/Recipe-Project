Categories: Beef
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/8 lb Steak, cut into 2 cm cubes
1 c  Thin coconut milk
1 c  Thick coconut milk
1 tb Muslim curry paste
1 md Potato,cut into 2 cm cubes
1 sm Onion
1/8 lb Raw peanuts, skinned

3 tb Tamarind water
1 tb Nam pla (Thai fish sauce)
cooked, that is it gives off a strong curry fragrance. Return the
meat to the pan, toss it in the paste and fry for a further 3-4 mins.
Pourthe remainder of the coconut milk back in, and simmer for a
further 10 mins. until the suace thickens and the oil separates and
forms a layer on the surface. Add the potato, onion, peanuts,
cardamon, lemon juice, tamarind water, nam pla, and the thick coconut
milk. Simmer for a further 30 mins. or until the meat and vegetables
are cooked. Taste and adjust the seasoning with nam pla, lemon juice
or tamarind as necessary. A few mins before serving, add the chilli.

This gaeng is popular with the Thai Muslims, and they generally would
not eat the other varieties of Thai curry. Buddhist (and the
Christians) Thais are not so fussy, and eat Gaeng Masaman as well as
the rest. Naturally, this is one dish in which one would not
subtitute pork for the beef.
