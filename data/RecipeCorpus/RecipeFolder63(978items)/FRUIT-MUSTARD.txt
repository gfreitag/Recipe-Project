-fruit
1 c  Mustard powder
2 1/2 c  Cold water

This aromatic mustard comes from Maggie Klein and Kurt Klingman if
Oliveto's in Oakland.

If using fresh fruit, saute the peeled and chopped nectar- ines or
peaches for 3 or 4 minutes, then simmer for 5 minutes longer, or
until the fruit has become soft and starts releasing its juice

Combine the fruit (fresh or dried), mustard powder, water, orange
zest, vinegar, sugar and salt in a saucepan and simmer until
well-thickened, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally, especially
during the last 30 minutes of cooking. Remove from heat and stir in
lemon juice.

Let cool and spoon into jars or other containers and refrig- erate.
The mustard will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.

Uses: Use as a spread, or for making mustard glazes for roast lamb and
pork. It's also great on old-fashioned hot dogs!

Makes 1 1/2 pints.
