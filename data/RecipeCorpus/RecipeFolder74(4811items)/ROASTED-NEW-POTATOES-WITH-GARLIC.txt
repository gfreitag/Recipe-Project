~------------- ~-- Preheat oven to 325Ã¸F.  Place oils, garlic cloves,
rosemary and bay leaves in a 9 X 13 inch baking dish. Place the dish
in oven and heat until oil is hot, about 5 minutes.  While oil is
heating, cut potatoes into quarters, or halves if small. Place
potatoes in a bowl of cold water to prevent them from darkening.
When oil is hot, drain potatoes and pat dry thoroughly with paper
towels. Remove baking dish from oven and carefully place potatoes in
dish.  Lightly season with salt and pepper. Stir to coat with oil.
Roast, shaking dish and turning potatoes every 15 minutes, until
browned and cooked through, about 1-1/4 hours. Using a slotted spoon,
transfer roasted potatoes and garlic to serving dish. Serve hot. Cut
the ends off the cloves of garlic and squirt the garlic puree over
the roasted potatoes. From: Syd's Cookbook.
