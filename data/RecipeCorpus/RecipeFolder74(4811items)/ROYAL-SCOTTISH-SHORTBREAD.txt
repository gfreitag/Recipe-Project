Title: ROYAL SCOTTISH SHORTBREAD
Categories: Bread/rolls, Scotland
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Butter (no substitutions!)
1/2 c  Powdered sugar
2 c  Flour
Cream together butter and sugar. Knead in flour. Place dough on cookie
sheet and pat out a 3/4 inch thick rectangle or circle. Prick surface.
Chill 1/2 hour. Bake 5 minutes at 375 degrees and 45 minutes at 300
degrees, until golden but not brown. Cut into squares or wedges.

[I've substituted whole wheat flour for half the white flour. It
doesn't exactly make this a healthy treat, but it does add an
interesting flavor and color.] Shared by Kathy Lankford Converted
