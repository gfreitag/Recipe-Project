Title: RISOTTO WITH MINT
Categories: Italian, Rice
Yield: 6 Servings
6 c  Chicken stock
5 tb Unsalted butter
1    Onion; finely chopped
2 c  Arborio rice
1 c  Dry white wine
1/3 c  Fresh mint leaves; loosely
-packed
1 c  Parmigiano; freshly grated
Salt; to taste
Recipe by: Modern Italian Cooking Heat stock in a medium-size
saucepan and keep warm over very low heat.

Melt 4 Tablespoons of the butter in a large saucepan. When the butter
foams, add the onion.  Saute over medium heat until the onion is pale
yellow.  Add the rice. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or just enough to
coat the rice with the butter and onion.  Stir in the wine. Cook,
stirring constantly, until the wine has evaporated. Add a few laddles
of broth, just enough to barely cover the rice. Cook over medium
heat, until the broth has been absorbed.  Continue cooking and
stirring the rice in this manner, adding the broth a bit at a time,
until the rice is done, 15 to 20 minutes. During the last 2 or 3
minutes of cooking, chop the mint very fine and add to the rice with
the remaining tablespoon of butter and 1/3 cup of the parmigiano.
Taste for seasoning and doneness.  The rice should be tender but
still firm to the bite.  At this point, the rice should have a
creamy, moist consistancy. Serve immediately with the remaining
parmigiano.
