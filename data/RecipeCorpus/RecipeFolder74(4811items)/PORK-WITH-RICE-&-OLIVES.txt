Title: PORK WITH RICE & OLIVES
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Pork boneless shoulder
1/4 c  Vinegar
1    Med onion, chopped
2    Cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 ts Crushed red pepper
3    Slices bacon
2 c  Boiling water
1 c  Uncooked regular rice
1/4 c  Sliced pimiento-stuffed oliv
2 tb Snipped parsley
1 1/2 ts Salt
Trim fat from pork and cut pork into 3/4-inch cubes. Mix together
pork, vinegar, onion, garlic and red pepper in glass or plastic bowl.
Cover and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, at least 6 hours. Fry
bacon until crisp. Drain. Remove pork from marinade, reserving
marinade. Cook and stir pork in bacon fat until all liquid has
evaporated and pork is brown on all sides. Drain. Mix together pork,
reserved marinade, bacon and remaining ingredients in ungreased
2-quart casserole. Cover. Bake at 350F until liquid is absorbed, 25
to 30 minutes. Though Arroz con Carne de Cerdo is a traditional
casserole from the Dominican Republic, it hints of Africa where
highly seasoned combinations of rice and meat are common.
