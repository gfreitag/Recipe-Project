HOT CHILI TIPS: Throw out any chili spices over a year old.(The
Reeds, who believe fresh spices are the major secrets to their
success, buy only three months worth of spices at a time. And they
date their spice jars.) For a smoother chili gravy, grind the spices
in a coffee mill to make them finer. For a darker chili,add more
paprika or chili powder. Combine chili powders,some dark,some medium.
The Reeds order some of their chili powders and spices from Penderys
in Dallas (800) 533-1870. But a lot of people cook with McCormick's
chili powder, available at supermarkets, or bulk chili powders and
peppers from Whole Foods. According to the Reeds, no one cooks
competition chili in an iron pot anymore. Competitors tend to use
other heavy saucepans, often Teflon lined to prevent burning. (The
Reeds cook in Club Aluminum pots with a Siverstone lining.) If you
are cooking chili outdoors, you have to take the elements into
account. Wind will affect the amount of liquid in a pot of chili, as
well as the cooking fire. Hot weather can affect a final recipe,
because you generally need more salt to get a winning taste when the
temperature is pushing 100. For cooking chili outdoors, cook over
propane and use a heat distributor for even simmering.
