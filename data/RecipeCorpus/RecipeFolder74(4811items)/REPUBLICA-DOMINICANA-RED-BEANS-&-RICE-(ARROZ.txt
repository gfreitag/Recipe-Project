Title: REPUBLICA DOMINICANA RED BEANS & RICE (ARROZ
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------BEANS--------------------------------
1 c  Dry red beans *
3 c  -Water (approx.)
3 c  -Fresh water
1 tb Cumin
1 tb Raw sugar
1 tb White vinegar
2    Garlic cloves
- peeled and chopped
1    Onion; peeled and chopped
1/2 ts Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 ds Tabasco
MMMMM--------------------------FOR RICE-------------------------------
1 c  Rice
2 1/2 c  Water
*NOTE: (red beans are not the same as kidney beans- they are smaller)

Soak the beans in the water overnight or at least 8 hours. Drain the
soaking water.

Put the beans and all the rest of the ingredients into a large
cooking pot. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce to moderate-low
heat and cook for about 1 hour, until most of the water is absorbed.
Add more water if you need to, and stir the beans every 10 minutes or
so.

When the beans have 1/2 hour to go, make the rice. Put the rice and
water in a saucepan, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cover.
Simmer until all the water is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Then turn
the heat off and let sit, with cover on, about 10 minutes.

To serve, serve the beans over the rice.

Serve with sliced avocado (aguacate), fried plaintain chips (platanos
fritos), and cornbread (served fried like hush-puppies). For dessert
serve fruit such as papaya with coconut, and expresso coffee (for
Dominican style expresso: fill up your demitasse cup 1/2 full of raw
sugar, then add outrageously strong expresso coffee!).
