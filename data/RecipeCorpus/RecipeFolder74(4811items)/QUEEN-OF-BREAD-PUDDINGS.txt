Categories: Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Breadcrumbs -- (3 oz)
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Margarine -- (1/2 oz)
2 c  Hot milk -- (1 pint)
2    Eggs
1/2 ts Vanilla essence or a pinch
Spice
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Softened red jam -- (2 to
3    )
Put the breadcrumbs, sugar and margarine in a bowl and pour on the hot
milk.  Leave to soak for a few minutes. Separate the egg yolks and
whites; beat the yolks and add to the milk mixture. Add flavouring
and salt. Pour into a greased 1 litre (2 pint) pie dish or baking
dish and cook until set, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and
allow to stand for a few minutes.  Meanwhile beat the egg whites and
make the meringue with 2-4 Tbs sugar, according to taste. Soften the
jam by warming or adding a little hot water. Spread jam on top of
pudding and cover with meringue. Bake until the meringue is lightly
coloured, 15 - 20 minutes. Serve hot or cold. Banana: Make in the
same way as Queen of Puddings, but add a mashed banana to the bread
mixture.  Mashed banana may also be mixed with the jam to spread on
top, or cover the top with sliced banana and omit the jam.
Butterscotch: Use the same recipe as Queen of Puddings, but with 1/2
cup (4 oz) brown sugar instead of the white sugar, and heat it with
the margarine until the sugar melts. Dissolve this in the hot milk
before proceeding in the usual way. Chocolate: Use the Queen of
Pudding recipe, adding an extra tablespoon of sugar and 4 level Tbs
cocoa to the breadcrumbs Coconut: Use the Queen of Pudding recipe,
adding 1/2 cup desiccated coconut to the crumbs. Orange or Lemon:
Use the Queen of Pudding recipe, adding the grated rind of one orange
or lemon.  Leave out the vanilla or spice and use marmalade instead
of jam.
