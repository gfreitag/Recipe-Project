Title: RASPBERRY-TANGERINE MOUSSE
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-==========================
Ingredients:

2 tblsp  unflavored gelatin 4 tblsp cold water juice and grated zest
of 1 large tangerine 2 pints raspberries (or 20 oz frozen) 2 egg
yolks 4 tblsp tangerine liqueur (If you can't find this, Grand
Marnier or Cointreau will do, but use only 2 tsp of them.) 1/2 cup
granulated sugar 2 cups whipping cream Dissolve gelatin in water. It
will form a rubbery chunk. Add juice, zest and berries (save a few
berries for garnish) and heat gently. It should boil, but just
barely. Stir the whole time. Cook until the rubbery gelatin chunk is
dissolved.  This will mangle most of the berries; that's ok.  This
stuff should be a chunky goop at this point. Let it cool.

Beat egg yolks and sugar together.  They should be a pale yellow. Add
liqueur and mix thoroughly.  Heat over a double boiler until it
thickens slightly (stirring constantly.) It shouldn't take very long;
the color will change slightly.  If it's hot all the way through,
that's good enough. Let it cool.

Mix egg yolk goop and berry goop thoroughly.

Whip cream to soft peaks and fold into the mixture. Chill and serve.
I like to put it into individual dessert glasses before chilling. Add
some berries or other fruit as a garnish.
