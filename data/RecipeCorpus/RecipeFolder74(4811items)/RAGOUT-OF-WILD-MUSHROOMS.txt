Title: RAGOUT OF WILD MUSHROOMS
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Dried porcini mushrooms
1/2 c  Cold water
1/2 c  Shallots, coarsely chopped
1 tb Olive oil
4 ea Garlic cloves, chopped
3 1/4 c  Mixed wild mushrooms
-cut into 1" pieces
1 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
2 ea Thyme sprigs
1 c  Plum tomatoes, diced
1/4 c  Tomato sauce
1/2 c  Red wine
1 ts Porcini Powder (opt)
This dish can be served on rice, with polenta, or as the topping for
pasta or baked potatoes.

1. Soak the porcini in the cold water for 30 minutes. Lift the
mushrooms from the soaking water, squeezing them over the water to
return any liquid to the cup; coarsely chop the mushrooms and set
aside. Strain the porcini water through a fine-mesh sieve and reserve.

2. In a medium skillet, saut the shallots in olive oil until they
soften, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and saut until light brown,
2-3 minutes. Add the porcini and wild mushrooms and toss well.

3. Add the salt, pepper, thyme, tomatoes, tomato sauce, wine, porcini
water, and Porcini Powder, if using. Bring to a simmer over high
heat. Turn heat to low, cover and simmer until the mushrooms are
cooked, 10-15 minutes. If the mushrooms are cooked through but the
sauce is too thin, uncover and simmer for a few minutes until the
sauce has thickened. Remove the thyme. Serve hot.

Can be prepared 1 day ahead and refrigerated. Reheat gently before
serving.
