Coarsely chop the remaining apple and pear; place in 2 quart saucepan
and set aside. 2. To baking dish, add the onions, carrots, bay
leaves, fruit concentrate, thyme, garlic and orange rind; mix well.
Rub the pork on all sides with about 1/2 teaspoon of the oil. Place
it in the dish and turn to coat all sides with the marinade mixture.
Cover and set aside for 3 to 4 hours in a cool place (refrigerate in
hot weather). 3. While pork marinates, saute reserved apple and pear
in the remaining oil over medium heat for about 3 minutes.  Stir in
raspberries, remove from heat and set aside. 4. Preheat oven to 350
degrees. 5. Remove pork from marinade, sear on all sides over high
heat (about 4 minutes per side). Place marinade in bottom of roasting
pan, place pork on a rack over marinade. Roast for 40 to 50 minutes,
or until pork reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees. 6.
Remove pork from pan, set aside, keep warm. 7. Pour any accumulated
fat from roasting pan.  Add stock and cider. Over high heat,
constantly stir the liquid and scrape the bottom of pan for about 5
minutes to deglaze. 8. Mix water and cornstarch until smooth, add to
pan and stir until thickened. Strain the sauce into a saucepan and
keep warm over low heat. Season with pepper. 9. Briefly reheat the
compote. Serve thinly sliced pork with the compote and sauce.  A good
accompaniment would be sauted slices of polenta. Per serving: 335
