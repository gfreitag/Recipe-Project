Title: RAISIN MUFFINS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
1 c  Cereal, unsweetened
3/4 c  Milk
1 c  Flour
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
1    Eggs
1/4 c  Oil
Finely chopped pitted dates may be substituted to get Date Muffins. If
using sweetened cereal, omit sugar.

Preheat oven to 400.  Grease 12 muffin cups.  Mix cereal and milk. Let
stand a few minutes until most of the milk is absorbed.

Sift flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar into a medium-sized bowl.
Stir to mix well.  Add raisins and nuts; toss to mix. Add egg and oil
to soaked cereal and beat well with fork. Pour into flour mixture and
stir only until dry ingredients are moistened.  Batter will be lumpy.

Drop batter into prepared pans, filling each cup 2/3 full. Bake 15
minutes, or until browned.  Remove from pan and serve immediately.
