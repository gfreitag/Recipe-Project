In the central and northern part of Mexico, where the chile poblano
is used a great deal, to ask for rajas most commonly means strips of
chile poblano cooked in this way. It makes an excellent accompaniment
for broiled meats.

Remove the seeds and veins from the chiles and cut them into strips
about 1 1/2 inhes long and 1/2 inch wide. If the chiles seem too
picante, soak them in salted water for about 30 minutes.

Heat the oil and fry the onions gently, without browning them, until
they are soft.

Add the chile strips and salt to the onions in the pan, cover, and
cook gently for about 8 minutes.

You can always prepare these ahead of time and they will keep in the
refriegerator for several days. They are inclined to get a bit soggy
if you freeze them.
