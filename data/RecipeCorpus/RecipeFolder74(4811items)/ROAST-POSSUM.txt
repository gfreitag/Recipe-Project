Title: ROAST POSSUM
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Possum, whole, uncleaned
1    Onion, large, chopped
1 tb Bacon fat
Possum liver
1 c  Bread crumbs
1 ts Red pepper, chopped
Worcestershire sauce, dash
1    Egg, hardboiled, finely chop
Salt to taste
Possums are roasted with hide on, so prepare a large pot of scalding
hot water. Dip possum in it for a few minutes, then remove the hair
by scraping with a dull knife, as you would scrape a hog. If some
hair comes off hard, dip again in scalding (not hard-boiling) water.
Wash with soap and water, then remove entrails, keeping washed liver.
Remove head and tail (some people keep the head on). Soak in cold
water to which is added 1 cup salt. Drain and rinse with boiling
water. Stuff with possum stuffing, close the opening, and roast in
black iron pot with a little water for 1-1/2 hours at 350. Baste
often. SEE possum stuffing recipe. Add sweet potatoes 1 hour before
possum is done.
