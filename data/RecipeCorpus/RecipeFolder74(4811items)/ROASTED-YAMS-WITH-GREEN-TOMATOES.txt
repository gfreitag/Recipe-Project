Title: ROASTED YAMS WITH GREEN TOMATOES
Categories: Vegetables, Potatoes
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Yams
2 lb Green tomatoes; 7-8 medium
3 md Red tomatoes
3 md Red onions
6 lg Cloves garlic
1 tb Olive oil; to 2 tb
Salt & pepper to taste
Peel the yams and cut them in 1/2- or 1-inch dice. Trim the tomatoes
and cut them in large chunks. Peel the onions and cut them in 1-inch
chunks. Peel the garlic and, if the cloves are very large, cut them
in half lengthwise.

Combine all the vegetables in a large bowl, drizzle on the olive oil,
add some salt and pepper, and mix well. Spread the vegetables out on
two baking sheets, preferably non-stick.

Roast the vegetables at 375 for about 1 1/2 hours, moving them around
and turning them twice during the cooking time. They should be very
tender, and browning here and there.

Serve with couscous, or with a rice pilaf.
