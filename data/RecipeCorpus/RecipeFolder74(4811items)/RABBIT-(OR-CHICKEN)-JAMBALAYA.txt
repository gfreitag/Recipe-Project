1    (about 3-lb) rabbit OR

4 tb Margarine
1 1/2 c  Finely chopped onions

Cut meat away from rabbit or chicken bones and chop into 1/4-inch
pieces; use scraps, bones, and giblets (excluding the liver) to make
the stock. Refrigerate meat until ready to use. Combine the seasoning
mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. Melt the margarine in
a 4-quart saucepan. Add 3/4 cup each of the onions, celery, and bell
peppers, then stir in the seasoning mix, Tabasco, and tasso. Cook
over high heat until onions are dark brown, about 20 minutes,
stirring constantly. Add the remaining 3/4 cup each of onions,
celery, and bell peppers. Cook about 5 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Add the tomato sauce and simmer about 5 minutes,
stirring constantly. Add the rabbit and cook over high heat for 15
minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the rice, mixing well. Reduce
heat and simmer for about 12 minutes. Add the stock. Bring the
mixture to a boil; reduce heat and simmer covered over very low heat
until rice is tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. To serve, mold
rice in an 8-ounce cup. Place 2 cups on each serving plate for a main
course or 1 cup for an appetizer. Makes 4 main-dish or 8 appetizer
servings.
