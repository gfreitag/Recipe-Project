Preparation Time: 2:00 STEP ONE: Prepare the Duckling and Basic Brown
Sauce-- Trim the duck of excess fat at the base of the tail. Rub the
inside with the seasoning salt and rosemary.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Place the duckling in a roasting pan, add 1/2 cup of water, and roast
for 1-1/2 hours, basting occasionally.

Remove the duckling from the oven and keep warm.

Pour off all but two tablespoons of fat from the roasting pan, add the
onions and celery, and saute until tender. Add two cups of brown
sauce. Boil for 20 minutes.

The  basic sauce is now ready for additional flavoring.

STEP TWO: Prepare the Orange Sauce-- Melt the butter, vinegar, and
sugar in a saucepan and boil until the liquid caramelizes. Add the
orange juice, mustard, and basic brown sauce and bring to a boil.

Strain the sauce, then thicken with cornstarch and season with Grand
Marnier.
