Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Halve and seed the tomatoes and
season with salt and pepper. Lay the tomatoes on a baking rack set
over a cookie sheet in oven for 20 minutes, or until the skins slip
off easily. Meanwhile, combine the oil, vinegar, and chopped herbs.
Remove the tomatoes from the oven, slip off their skins, and brush
the tomato halves lightly with this vinaigrette. Return the tomatoes
to the oven to roast 1 hour more.

Meanwhile, slice the Montrachet log into 12 equal-size disks. Brush
each disk with the vinaigrette. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and
divide them among 4 salad plates, alternating slices of goat cheese
and roasted tomato halves.

Toss the greens with the remaining vinaigrette and place 1/2 cup
alongside each serving of tomatoes and cheese.
