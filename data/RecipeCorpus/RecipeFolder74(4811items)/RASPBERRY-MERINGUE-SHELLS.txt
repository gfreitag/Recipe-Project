Title: RASPBERRY MERINGUE SHELLS
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
3    Egg whites
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
1 ds Salt
1 c  Sugar
Fresh raspberries
Frozen vanilla yogurt
Whipping cream, whipped
MMMMM--------------------OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS-------------------------
Chambord or Framboise
-liqueur
Servings:

To egg whites (at room temperature) add vanilla, cream of tartar, and
salt. Beat til frothy.  Gradually add sugar, a small amount at a
time, beating until very stiff peaks form and sugar is completely
dissolved.

Cover a cookie sheet with plain ungreased paper (I use brown paper
grocery bags).  Spoon meringue onto paper, dividing into 6 equal
mounds. Shape with the back of a spoon to form bird nest shapes. Bake
at 275 degrees F for one hour.  Turn off oven and let dry with the
door closed for at least another 1 1/2 hours.  If meringues will not
be used immediately, place into an airtight container to store, or
they can be left in an oven which has a pilot light overnight.

Place meringues on serving plates.  Place a large scoop of vanilla
frozen yogurt (or vanilla ice cream) into each meringue, smother with
fresh raspberries, drizzle with Chambord, Framboise, or other
raspberry liquor (optional), and top with whipped cream (or whipped
topping).
