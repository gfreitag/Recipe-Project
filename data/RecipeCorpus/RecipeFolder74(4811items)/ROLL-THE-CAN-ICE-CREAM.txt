Mix ingredients in the smaller 1 lb can.  Cover can and set in center
of the larger can.  Layer half the crushed ice alternately with half
the salt in the empty space in between the cans. Cover the larger
can. Now the fun begins:  Choose a hard, level surface like a patio
or cement walk and roll the can back and forth for ten minutes. Open
outer can; empty old ice and water.  Lift out small can; wipe lid dry
and remove. With a table knife or spatula, scrape ice cream from can
sides so it falls to center. Stir and cover. Return small can. Repack
with ice and salt. Cover and roll for five more minutes. Per 1/2 cup
