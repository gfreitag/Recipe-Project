Title: PRESERVED LEMONS
Categories: Condiments, Moroccan, Fruits
Yield: 1 Recipe
5 ea Lemons
1/4 c  Salt, more if desired
1 ea Cinnamon stick
3 ea Cloves
Coriander seeds, 5 to 6
Black peppercorns, 3 to 4
1 ea Bay leaf
Freshly squeezed lemon juice
If you wish to soften the peel, soak the lemons in lukewarm water for
3 days, changing the water daily. Quarter the lemons from the top to
within 1/2" of the bottom, sprinkle salt on the exposed flesh, then
reshape the fruit. Place 1 tb. salt on the bottom of a sterilized
one-pint mason jar. Pack in the lemons and push them down, adding
more salt, and the optional spices, between layers.  Press the lemons
down to release their juices and to make room for the remaining
lemons. (If the juice released from the squashed fruit does not cover
them, add freshly squeezed lemon juice - not chemically produced
lemon juice and not water.*) Leave some air space before sealing the
jar. Let the lemons ripen in a warm place, shaking the jar each day
to distribute the salt and juice. Let ripen for 30 days. To use,
rinse the lemons, as needed, under running water, removing and
discarding the pulp, if desired - and there is no need to refrigerate
after opening.  Preserved lemons will keep up to a year, and the
pickling juice can be used two or three times over the course of a
year.
