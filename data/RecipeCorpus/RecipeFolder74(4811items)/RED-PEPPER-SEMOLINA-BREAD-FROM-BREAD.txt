Title: RED PEPPER-SEMOLINA BREAD FROM BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Loaf
1 tb Rice yeast, SAF instant one
1 tb Dough enhancer
2 c  Warm water, 105 F to 115 F
2 c  Semolina flour
2 lg Red bell peppers,
Roasted & peeled
4 c  Unbleached all-purpose
Or bread flour
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 tb Salt
1. Combine yeast, dough enhancer, water, semolina flour, red peppers,
2 cups of the unbleached flour and the oil in a heavy duty mixer
bowl. Mix just until ingredients are combined. Cover loosely and let
sponge for 15 minutes. 2. Add the salt. 3. With mixer on low speed
and using the remainder of the unbleached flour, add just enough
flour until the sides of the bowl are cleaned by the dough. The dough
should still be soft & sticky. 4. Knead on low speed for 7 minutes.
The dough will no longer be sticky but elastic. 5. Turn dough out
onto a lightly greased surface & form into two loaves. Place into 2
greased pans or onto a greased baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal,
if desired. Let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. 6. Bake in a
preheated 350 F oven for about 35-40 minutes. I substituted an equal
amount of applesauce for the oil and used jarred roasted red peppers
from Trader Joe's and used freshly milled Golden 86 flour instead of
unbleached flour.
