Yield: 10 Servings
2 lb (6 medium sized) old
-potatoes (the older, the
-better)
1 tb Salt
1/4 lb (1 cup) flour
This excellent soft pancake wrapper, easily made at home, is eaten in
Norway with butter and 'geitost' cheese, or used to wrap delicious
little morsels of smoked ham, 'fenalar', dried and salted leg of
mutton, or a spoonful of berry conserve.

You will need a griddle or a heavy frying pan, or best of all, a
'takke'. Boil the potatoes in their skins. Peel them as soon as they
are cool enough to handle and immediately mash them with the salt.
Speed makes light pancakes.  Mix with the flour into a dough. (Less
or more flour may be needed - potatoes are very variable. The less
flour you use, the better.) Form into a long sausage and chop of
lengths. Roll these pieces out into pancakes about 1/8 inch thick.

Bake the 'lompe' on a hot iron surface.

Yield:  Makes 10 to 12 small pancakes Time: 1 hour
