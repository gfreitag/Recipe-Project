Title: ROAST LUNG KONG CHICKEN
Categories: Chinese, Chicken
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Chicken, cut in half
Looing sauce:
4 c  Water
1 c  Light soy sauce
1 c  Dark soy sauce
1    Star anise
1/2 c  Dry sherry
5 tb Sugar
4 sl Fresh ginger
Additional
6 c  Peanut oil for deep frying
Blanch the chicken halves in boiling water for 2 minutes. Drain.
Place the bird halves in a pot with the looing sauce ingredients and
bring to a boil. They should be covered with the sauce.  Turn the
heat to a simmer and cook lightly for 15 minutes, then allow the
halves to cool in the sauce. Remove and place on a rack on the
counter. Pat dry with paper towels and dry the meat using an electric
fan.  Aim the fan at the bird halves for about 3 hours, or until the
skin is dry to the touch. Deep fry one half at a time in oil at 350
degrees.  Be very careful when sliding the half into the hot oil.  A
wok lid will be helpful in protecting your hands and face in case the
oil should pop and spit at you. Deep fry each half until the skin is
crispy and golden.  Drain on paper towels before cutting up to serve.
