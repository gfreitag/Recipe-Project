Title: PORK BABY BACK RIBS
Categories: Main
Yield: 1 Servings
SEE DIRECTIONS:
These are the best ribs in the world. I know. I've tried them all.
There is a BBQ joint in heaven and it has one thing on the menu. This
is it.

1 rack of pork baby back ribs per moderately hungry person. Marinate
in cider vinegar about 10 minutes. Liberally use garlic salt and
canned black pepper Use hickory, oak, or mesquite At 200-225, they
should take
2 1/2    hours

Use a water pan. Sauce goes on the side. (You won't need it.)

That's it? Yep. Don't mess with perfection. Don't try fresh cracked
pepper or cloves of garlic. Don't try spare ribs. I did once and made
my wife cry.
