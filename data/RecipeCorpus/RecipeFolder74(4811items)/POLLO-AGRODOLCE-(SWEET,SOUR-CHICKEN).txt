Categories: Chicken, Italian, Wine
Yield: 4 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
1 c  Marsala wine
1    Onion; minced
2    Whole cloves
2    Cloves garlic; sliced
1    Bay leaf
1    Chicken; cut up and cleaned
Flour
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 c  Chicken broth
2 tb Sugar
1/2 c  White wine vinegar
Make marinade by heating wine, onion, cloves, garlic, and bay leaf in
a sauce pan.  Just before it boils, pour over chicken parts in a
bowl. Cover and let cool. Refrigerate overnight. (You can refrigerate
in morning so that it is ready by evening.)

Remove chicken parts from marinade.  Dredge in flour and sprinkle
with salt and pepper.  Use large skillet and saute in olive oil.
Remove. Pour off any excess fat from pan. Discard bay leaf and cloves
from marinade and add marinade to pan.  Simmer for 5 minutes and then
return chicken to pan, spooning sauce over top. Add broth and bring
to simmer, stirring occasionally.  Cover and cook 15 minutes or until
tender, turning chicken at least once.

While chicken is simmering, heat sugar in small saucepan until it
melts to a golden color.  Stir in vinegar. Pour this over chicken a
few minutes before it is done and stir to blend. Serves 4-6. Source:
