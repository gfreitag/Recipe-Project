TO MAKE DOUGH: Mix flour with warm water and knead for 10 to 15
minutes. There is no need to add any flour on the board as you knead
because the dough should be at a perfect consistency. Let dough rest
for 20 minutes while you make the filling. TO MAKE FILLING: Partially
thaw spinach and lightly squeeze out liquid (leave some liquid with
the spinach). Mix with rest of ingredients. WRAPPING: Divide dough
into 4 parts. Roll each part out to about 12 inches in length and
divide into 12 balls. Roll each ball into 3 inch round flat discs and
drop 1 tbsp. of filling in center. Fold the dough over the filling,
pinching together just the top to make a half circle. On the side
nearest you, form 2 to 3 pleats on each side and pinch them to meet
the opposite side to seal. Continued in Part 2.
