Lemon wedges -- garnish

In a small bowl, mix together the eggs and buttermilk. In another
bowl, combine the flour, cracker crumbs, almonds, salt, cayenne
pepper, and coriander. Dip the pounded cutlets into the egg mixture,
then dredge them in the flour mixture, pressing the breading on to
make the almonds adhere. Lay the cutlets on a baking sheet and
refrigerate for at least 1 hour. This can be done up to 24 hours in
advance. When ready to serve, heat enough butter and olive oil to
cover the bottom of a large skillet until "singing" hot. Cook the
cutlets 3 at a time, turning and cooking about 3 to 4 minutes per
side, or until the almonds are golden and browned. Drain on paper
towels. Sprinkle with the sliced green onions and accompany with the
lemon wedges.
