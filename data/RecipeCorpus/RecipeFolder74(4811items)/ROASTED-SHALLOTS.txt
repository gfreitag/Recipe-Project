Title: ROASTED SHALLOTS
Categories: Seasonings, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Large shallots (abt. 22-24)
-- peeled, root ends trimmed
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
2 tb Olive oil
3    Sprigs fresh rosemary
Preheat oven to 350 F.

Arrange shallots in a shallow baking dish.  Sprinkle with salt and
pepper; drizzle with olive oil.  Add the rosemary, cover with foil,
and roast 30 minutes. Uncover and roast for 25 to 30 minutes longer,
until shallots are tender when pierced with a sharp knife. Increase
oven temperature to 450 F. Roast the shallots about 10 minutes,
shaking the pan occasionally, until browned.  Serve hot.

Shepherd says: "Roasting makes the shallots caramelize and become
tender sweet and delicious, wonderful with roasted meat or poultry."
