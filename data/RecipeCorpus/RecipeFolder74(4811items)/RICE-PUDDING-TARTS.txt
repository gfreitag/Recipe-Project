Title: RICE PUDDING TARTS
Categories: Desserts, Pie
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Cooked Rice
1/4 c  Seedless Raisins
1 3/4 c  2% Low-Fat Milk
1/2 ts Vanilla Extract
8    Individual Tart Pastry
Shells, partially baked and
Cooled
1/4 c  Sugar
1/8 ts Salt
1    Egg
1/4 ts Almond Extract
1/8 ts Ground Nutmeg
Sweetned Whipped Cream(opt)
Sliced Fresh Fruit (opt)
1.  Preheat oven to 350F. 2. In a medium saucepan, combine rice, sugar
raisins and salt and 1 cup of the milk. Stirring frequently, cook over
medium-low heat until thick and creamy, about 25-35 minutes. 3.
Meanwhile, in small bowl, beat together egg and egg whites. Remove
hot rice mixture from heat; stir a small amount of the hot rice
mixture in beaten eggs. Stir egg mixture into hot rice mixture, then
return to saucepan. Stir in remaining 3/4 c milk and vanilla and
almond extracts. Spoon equal amounts of pudding into pastry shells,
sprinkle with nutmeg and place on a baking sheet.  Bake for 25-30
minutes or until pudding is set. Let cool on wire rack for 1 hour.
Use a knife to carefully loosen edges of tarts from tart pans and
unmold. Serve at room temperature with whipped cream and fruit, if
desired.  Refrigerate remaining tarts. Note: Medium or short grain
rice will make a creamier pudding. Also, instead of tart pastry
shells, you can use a package of refrigerated un- baked pie crusts.
Trim piecrusts to fit into 8 individual tart pans and bake for 5
minutes at 450F.
