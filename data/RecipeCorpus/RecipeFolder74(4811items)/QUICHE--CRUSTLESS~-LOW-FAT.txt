Title: QUICHE -CRUSTLESS~ LOW FAT
Categories: Low fat, Main dish

None
We have quiche here in South Africa. I make a crustless quiche - much
quicker, easier & lower fat
:).  What this means in practice is that, instead of making pastry
for the quiche, add a tablespoon of flour to your egg & milk custard
mixture, beat well to remove lumps and pour this over the fillings
which are placed in the dish (give the dish a spray of non-stick
baking spray). Cook as normal. During baking, the flour sinks to the
bottom of the custard to form a mock crust. I have made this using
ordinary white & wholwheat flour, as well as corn & potato flour.
