Title: ROASTED WHOLE HEADS OF GARLIC
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
8 ea Whole heads of garlic
1/2 c  Olive oil
Several sprigs of fresh
-- rosemary
Salt & pepper
Peel away some of the the papery layers from the garlic heads,
particularly from down among the top cloves, taking care not to break
off the cloves. Slice off the tops.  From 8 squares of heavy aluminum
foil, form 8 muffin sized cups, making sure that they are pinched
together firmly to prevent leakage. Place garlic heads in the cup,
drizzle with olive oil & sprinkle with rosemary & salt & pepper.  On
a covered grill, away from the hottest coals, cook the garlic for 1
hour, using a baster to drizzle on more olive oil once or twice while
it cooks.  Garlic is done when it is browned & mushy.
