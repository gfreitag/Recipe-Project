Title: RED'S PRIZE WINNIN' PINTOS
Categories: Sides
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Canned jalapeno peppers  --
Or suit yourself
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
1 ts Black pepper
1 tb Chili powder
2 lb Pinto beans  -- dry
1/2 lb Salt port  -- cubed
1    X1x1/4"
2 md Onion  -- chopped
2    Cloves garlic  -- minced
Soak the beans overnight. Drain, place in a pot, and refill with
water to cover the beans and add everything else. Cook very slowly
for 4 to 6 hours. When the beans are done, test for salt and adjust
to our preference. Don't salt in advance, because the salt pork will
do that for you.
