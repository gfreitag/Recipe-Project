Categories: Eggs, Cheese, Spicy
Yield: 3 Servings
6 lg Eggs
1/3 c  Beer
1/2 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce
3 tb Butter
3 tb Grated Parmesan Cheese
More than a decade ago, Rudy Stanish, "the Omelette King" would turn
out hundreds of omelettes at a time for charity functions. He always
added Tabasco pepper sauce to his egg mixture, and over the years he
cooked a bunch of omelettes for us on many occasions.  Rudy used beer
as the liquid in this cheese omelette recipe, giving the eggs even
more zip. ~------------------------------------------------------
~----------------- In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, beer and
Tabasco sauce with a whisk only until blended, not frothy. In an
8-1/2" omelette pan over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the
butter.  The pan is hot enough when a drop of water spatters in it.
Pour 1/3 of the egg mixture into the pan. Place one hand on the pan
handle, palm down, and move the pan in a back-and-forth motion.  With
the other hand, using a fork, stir the egg mixture in a circular
motion, about seven times. Sprinkle the omelette with a tablespoon of
the cheese.  To turn out the omelette, place your hand on the handle
with palm upward.  Tip the pan and roll the omelette out onto a
plate. Repeat twice with the remaining egg mixture. Serve with
additional Tabasco sauce, if desired.  Frrom: The Tabasco Cookbook.
