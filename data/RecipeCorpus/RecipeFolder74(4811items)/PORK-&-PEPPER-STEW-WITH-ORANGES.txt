Season the pork liberally with salt and pepper. In a heavy casserole
or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and quickly brown
the pork, in batches if necessary. Remove and set aside. Add the
remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil to the pot and saute the onions,
garlic, celery, poblanos, jalapeno and the red pepper over moderate
heat until just beginning to color. Add the fennel seed, oregano,
tomatoes, stock, white wine, chile powder and shrimp powder and bring
to a boil. Add the pork and the raisins, reduce the heat, cover, and
simmer gently until the pork is tender, about 35 to 40 minutes.
Remove from the heat and skim any fat from the top.

Just before serving, stir in the chopped cilantro. Serve with
Orange-Cinnamon Rice and garnish with orange segments and cilantro
sprigs.
