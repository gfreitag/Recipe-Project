Title: POTATO BOWLS
Categories: Cooking, Live
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lg Russet potatoes
Partially cook 3 large russet potatoes in a microwave oven on high
power for 12 minutes, or bake at 400 degrees F for 45 minutes, until
nearly tender. Halve crosswise. Hollow out insides, leaving
1/2-inch-thick shell. Trim the rounded ends so potato halves will
stand up. Coat nonstick baking sheet with cooking spray. Place potato
halves, rim side down, on baking sheet.

Bake at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes or until skins are crisp, rims
are golden brown, and potatoes are tender. Stand the potatoes up and
fill them with the roasted parsnips and carrots.

Yield: 6 potato bowl
