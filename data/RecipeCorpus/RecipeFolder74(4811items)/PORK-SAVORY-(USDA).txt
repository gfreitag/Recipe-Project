Title: PORK SAVORY (USDA)
Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
6 lb Lean pork -- cut in 1"
Cubes
2 1/2 c  Hot water
2 tb Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1 tb Instant minced onion
1 qt Potatoes -- pared and diced
2 1/2 c  Carrots -- pared and sliced
10 oz Frozen lima beans
1 1/2 c  Meat and vegetable cooking
Liquid
3/4 c  Unsifted flour
3/4 c  Cold water
2 c  Sour cream
Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
served without freezing.

Brown meat.  Add hot water, salt, pepper, and onion. Cover. Simmer
until meat is almost tender, about 30 minutes. Add potatoes and
carrots to meat mixture. Simmer 20 minutes longer. Drain meat and
vegetables; save cooking liquid.

Heat 1 1/2 cups reserved meat and vegetable cooking liquid to
boiling. Mix flour and cold water throughly. Stir slowly into boiling
liquid. Cook until thickened, stirring constantly. Stir in sour
cream. Pour mixture ovaer meat and vegetables.  Mix lightly.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Heat mixture to serving temperature.

TO FREEZE:  Pour each part to be frozen into a baking pan. Spread
mixture evenly to avoid air pockets. Cool for 30 minutes at room
temperature. Complete wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food.
Put edges of wrap together and fold several times so paper lies
directly on top of food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and
seal with freezer tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing,
and last date the food should be used for best eating quality (about
6 months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing
packages from the pans.

TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Remove
freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. Heat 1 hour or until bubbly
at edges.
