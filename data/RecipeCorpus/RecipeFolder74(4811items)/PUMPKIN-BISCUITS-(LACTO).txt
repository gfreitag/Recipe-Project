Title: PUMPKIN BISCUITS (LACTO)
Categories: Digest, Nov.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Canned pumpkin (NOT pie
Filling)
2/3 c  Skim milk or other form of
Liquid
1 1/2 c  Flour (half white, half WW)
2 tb Wheat germ
2 tb Wheat bran
4 ts Baking powder
1    Clove garlic, minced
1 pn Nutmeg
1 ts Salt (optional)
Combine wet, combine dry, mix wet into dry, drop by generous
spoonfuls onto baking sheet squirted with PAM. Bake 20-30 minutes at
450 degrees.

The garlic doesn't really give these a pronounced garlic flavor--it
just eliminates some of the cloying sweetness of the pumpkin. When
these first come out of the oven they are very crisp on the outside
and dense and moist on the inside--sort of like little
mini-spoonbreads. After they cook the texture becomes more uniform
and more like the standard biscuit we all know and love.
