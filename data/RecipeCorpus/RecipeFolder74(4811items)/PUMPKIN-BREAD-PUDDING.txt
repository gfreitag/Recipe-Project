Title: PUMPKIN BREAD PUDDING
Categories: Fruits, Breads, Puddings, Desserts
Yield: 10 Servings
4    Eggs
3 c  Whole milk
1 lb Mashed pumpkin
1 c  Brown sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 qt Torn bread pieces
1 c  Dark raisins
Boubon Sauce:
1/2 c  Unsalted butter
1    Egg
1 c  Sugar
2 tb Whole milk
1/2 c  Bourbon
PUDDING: Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add milk and beat again. Stir in
pumpkin, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and vanilla. Add bread pieces
and press with your hands to submerge bread in the milk mixture. (If
you have the time, cover and refrigerate the mixture several hours or
overnight; break up the bread the next day and bake as directed; if
not, proceed as follows.) Set the mixture aside for 15 minutes. Use
your fingers to break up the chunks of bread. Set aside 15 minutes
and repeat. Add raisins. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter
a 2 quart baking dish. Fill the dish with bread pudding mixture and
bake for 1 hour, or until pudding is set. Serve warm, hot or cold
with hot bourbon sauce. BOUBON SAUCE: Use unsalted real butter for
the best bourbon sauce; margerine doesn't make a great sauce. Melt
butter in a bowl set over hot but not boiling water. Combine egg,
sugar and milk in a small bowl and beat until light colored. Add to
butter and beat with a whisk over hot water until sugar dissolves -
at least 5 minutes. Add boubon and stir. Remove from stove and serve.
