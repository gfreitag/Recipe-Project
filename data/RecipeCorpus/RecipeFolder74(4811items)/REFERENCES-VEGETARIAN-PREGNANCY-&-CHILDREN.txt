Collins) Subject: Nutritional information

Several people have asked questions about nutrition, pregnancy
requirements, amino acids, and so on. For vegans, I would like to
recommend these resources:

Akers, Keith. A Vegetarian Sourcebook. Denver: Vegetarian Press, 1989.
Nutrient density charts show how easy it is to get more than enough
protein, iron, calcium, and other nutrients from plant foods alone.

Thrash, Agatha Moody, M.D. Nutrition for Vegetarians. Seale, Ala.: New
Lifestyle Books, 1982. Includes information about vegan nutrition
during pregnancy and childhood. Order by calling (205) 855-4708.

Klaper, Michael, M.D. Vegan Nutrition: Pure and Simple. Paia, Ha.:
Gentle World, 1992. Discusses problems associated with animal
products.

For detailed nutrient information, I refer to the tables in this
manual:

Pennington, Jean. Food Values of Portions Commonly Used. 15th ed. New
York: Harper Collins, 1989. Tables provide values of major nutrients
in common foods. Appendix includes amino acid analyses.
