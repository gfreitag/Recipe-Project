Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grease 16 muffin tins. Put 3 mixing
bowls on the counter. Mix the apples and sugar in one bowl and set
aside. Put the eggs, oil and vanilla in the second bowl, and stir to
blend well. In the third bowl, put the flour, baking soda, cinnamon,
and salt, and stir the mixture with a fork until blended.

Stir the egg mixture into the apples and sugar, and mix thoroughly.
Sprinkle the flour mixture over the apple mixture and mix well. (may
want to use your hands as this is a stiff batter) Sprinkle the
raisins and walnuts over the batter and mix until they are evenly
distributed. Spoon into the muffin tins.

Bake for about 25 minutes, or until a straw comes out clean when into
the center of a muffin. Serve warm. These are dense, moist and good!
