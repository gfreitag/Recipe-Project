*** SHORT PASTRY CRUST ***

Sift the flour and salt together into a large bowl. With 2 knives or a
pastry blender, cut in the butter and shortening until mixture is the
texture of coarse crumbs. Add only enough water to make a soft dough.
Form into a ball, wrap in wax paper and chill for at least 1 hour.

*** PIE ***

1. Roll the crust dough on a lightly floured surface to a 1/8"
thickness and place in the bottom of a 10" pie pan. Trim and flute
the edges.

2. Preheat the oven to 450'. Combine the pumpkin, honey, molasses and
spices in a food processor and process until well blended. With the
processor on, add eggs one at a time, processing a few seconds after
each addition. Transfer to a large bowl.

3. Beat the cream in a large bowl until doubled in volume. Fold into
the pumpkin mixture. Pour into prepared pie shell and bake 10
minutes. Reduce the heat to 350' and bake until a toothpick inserted
in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes longer. Arrange
cranberries in a circle on top of pie.
