Title: RICE & SOUR CREAM CASSEROLE
Categories: Grains
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 lb Monterey Jack Cheese
3 c  Dairy Sour Cream
2 cn Diced Green Chiles
3 c  Cooked Rice
1    Salt & Pepper To Taste
1/2 c  Grated Cheddar, Garnish
Cut Jack Cheese into strips about 1/8" thick. Thoroughly mix sour
cream and chiles. Butter a 1-1/2 quart casserole. Season rice with
salt and pepper. Layer rice, sour cream mixture and cheese strips, in
that order, until you finish with rice on the top. Bake in 350Ã¸F oven
for about 30 minutes. During the last few minutes of baking sprinkle
the grated cheddar cheese over the rice and allow it to melt before
removing casserole from oven. I have been told this dish should be
illegal, it is so good. From: Syd's Cookbook.
