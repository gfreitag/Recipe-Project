In a 10" skillet, melt the butter or heat the oil over medium-low
heat. Add the onion and saute slowly until almost limp but not brown,
about 6-7 minutes. Add the tamari or soy sauce and the tomato. Cook,
stirring often, until the tomato's juice has evaporated, about
6    minutes.

Transfer the saute to a soup pot. Deglaze the saute pan with a little
of the stock, and add the pan contents, plus the remainder of the
stock to the soup pot. Add the pumpkin or squash puree, the maple
syrup or honey, salt and a touch of freshly ground black pepper.
Heat, stirring often.

Separately, in a small pot with a tightly fitting lid, steam the
broccoli flowerets and stems until tender-crisp (they should be a
bright green), about 3-4 minutes.

Stir the steamed broccoli into the soup, then stir in the cream. Let
the soup cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until hot and the
flavors have blended, 8-10 minutes.
