Title: RAS ASFOUR (LENTIL SOUP)
Categories: Soups, Middle east
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 c  Yellow or orange lentils
-(go through them and pick
-out stones)
1/2 lb Choice ground beef
1/3 c  Chopped fresh parsley
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
2 ts Olive oil
1    Onion, sliced
1/2 c  Shaarla, or vermicelli

1/3 c  Lemon juice
Suhour ("the meal before sunrise") is usually good, stick-to-your-ribs
food.

Rinse lentils and drain, picking out any discolored ones. Combine
with 5-6 cups water in a large kettle and bring to a boil. Lower heat
and simmer for 20 minutes, skimming off foam as it forms on top.

While the lentils are cooking, combine ground meat with parsley, salt
and pepper. Using about a tablespoon of the meal mixture for each,
form into small meatballs and chill until needed.

Heat the olive oil and saute the onion until soft and golden.
Reserve. When lentils are soft, mash them with the back of a spoon to
thicken the soup. Add shaarla (or vermicelli) and meatballs. Cook
10-15 minutes longer, until meatballs are cooked through. To serve,
divide onion slices among 6 bowls. Stir lemon juice into soup and
ladle over onions.

Makes 6-8 servings.
