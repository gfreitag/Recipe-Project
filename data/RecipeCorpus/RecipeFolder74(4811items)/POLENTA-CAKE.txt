1/4 ts Sugar
1    Stick butter -- softened,

2    Egg yolks -- room temp
1 ts Orange zest -- finely

1/2 ts Lemon zest -- finely grated
1/2    Vanilla beans, or 1 tsp van

Polenta
1/4 c  Cornstarch  (yes 1/4 cup!)

Preheat oven to 325.  Generously butter an 8" X 1" square baking pan.

In a large bowl, combine 1/2 cup of the sugar and the butter, egg
yolks and orange and lemon zests.  Scrape seeds from vanilla bean
into mixture, or add extract. Using an electric mixer, beat at high
speed until smooth, light and creamy, about 2 minutes.

In a food processor, finely grind the almonds with the
cornmeal/polenta, cornstarch and baking powder.

In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with
the remaining 1/4 teaspoon sugar until they form soft peaks. Gently
fold the dry ingredients and 1/2 the beaten egg whites into the
butter mixture; then fold in the remaining egg whites unti just
incorporated.

Gently scrape the batter evenly into the prepared pan and bake for
about 30 minutes, or until the top of the cake is golden and a cake
tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer pan to a
cooling rack for 10 minutes; then invert the cake on the rack and let
cool completely. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar, cut into 6 pieces
and serve with topping. -Richard Sax
