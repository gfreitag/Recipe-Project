Place half rounds of cheese at one end of slice. Sprinkle with chives
and Herbes De Provence. Fold in sides and roll up jelly-roll fashion,
enclosing cheese.  Dip rolls in egg and then crumbs. Let dry on wax

drying, cover rolls and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature
before cooking.) In skillet, heat butter and saute rolls slowly until

and shallots to skillet and bring to boil. Pour pan juices over
rolls. Serve immediately.
