Categories: Desserts, Rice
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Medium Grain Rice -- (fx.

2 c  Water
3/4 ts Salt
1 tb Unsalted Butter -- * see
Note
1 tb Fine Bread Crumbs --
(approximately)
4 lg Eggs
1 c  Stout -- ** see note
1 c  Whipping Cream
1/2 ts Vanilla Extract
1 tb Sugar
1/4 ts Cinnamon

1/8 ts Ground Cloves
1/4 lb Pitted Dates -- chopped (2/3

2 tb All-Purpose Flour --

** (a sweet Stout in the English style -including those labeled
Oatmeal Stout, Milk Stout, or Imperial Stout- will provide a mellow
richness and overtones of coffee and chocolate, but a dry Irish-style
Stout is likely to be to bitter. Some brands of Porter might also
work if on the sweet side.)

1. Combine the rice, water, and salt in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a
boil, reduce the heat, cover, and cook until the water is absorbed,
about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, fluff with fork, cover, and let
cool.

2. Butter the bottom and sides of a 6-cup baking disk or 8 individual
casseroles (ramekins). Sprinkle with bread crumbs and roll the dish
around to coat all the surface with crumbs. Tap out excess.

3. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Beat the eggs lightly in a large
bowl. Add the Stout, 1/3 cup of the cream, vanilla, sugar, and spices
and stir to combine. Add the rice and stir to break up any clumps.
Toss the dates in flour to coat them evenly, shaking off the excess,
and stir them in. Pour the mixture into the baking dish. Cut the
butter into small pieces and scatter them on top. Bake uncovered
until set, about 1 hour. Serve warm, with the rest of the cream,
lightly whipped.

Serves 8.
