Title: RICH COCONUT MILK
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ea Ripe  coconut,
1 x  With a brown, hard shell
5 c  Very hot water
Bake the coconut in a 400 F oven for 15 - 20 minutes; a little more
will not hurt.  Remove coconut from the oven and give it several hard
whackw with a hammer to break it open and into 4 or 5 pieces. The
coconut water will drain away and is not used. Pry away the coconut
meat from the shell; use a dull knife to eliminate the possibility of
running the knife through one's fingers. Cut the meat into
1-inch-wide strips and then into horizontal thin slices. Put about 3
cups of the slices into a blender and pour in 4 cups of water (the
less water, the richer the coconut milk). Process for about 1 minute,
which will be enough time to cut up the coconut and release the milk.
Pour the mixture through a metal sieve and squeeze out the coconut
fragments.  The liquid that remains is coconut milk. It can be stored
in the referator for 3 days, or it can be frozen in plastic
containers for future use. Source: False Tongues and Sunday Bread by
