Title: POLISH NOODLES
Categories: Pork
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Sweet butter
8 oz Sour cream*
1 lb Ham, cubed
16 oz Ripened tomatoes, chopped
2 c  Elbow macaroni**
1 oz Maggi Seasoning OR
-1 tb Soy sauce
1/2 ts Salt, optional
1/2 ts Pepper
2    Green onions, chopped
*light if desired (don't use non-fat) **cooked al Dente (be careful
not to overcook)

Brown butter in Dutch oven. Add remaining ingredients except onions,
salt (if using) and pepper. Mix well. Simmer uncovered for 10
minutes. Add onions and cook 5 minutes more.

Melinda's notes: I got this from an old Polish acquaintance long ago.
I don't know how original Polish it is since it uses Maggi Seasoning,
which I think is German, but we like it. Maggi Seasoning comes in a
square-ish brown bottle and can be purchased in the gourmet section
of your supermarket. I always omit the salt. The original recipe
called for 4 oz. sour cream, but I like it with 8 oz. I usually use
the light sour cream, but the non-fat doesn't do well, it seems to
just dissolve and become tasteless.
