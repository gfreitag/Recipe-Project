Title: PORK MEDALLIONS WITH PORT SAUCE
Categories: Meats, Pork, Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Pork tenderloin, trimmed
Salt and pepper to taste
Flour, as needed
2 tb Unsalted butter or margarine
2 tb Olive oil
1 c  Chicken stock
1 c  Port wine
1.  Slice the tenderloin crosswise into medallions 1/2" thick.
Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper, and then dredge each in the
flour to coat, shaking off any excess.

2.  Heat the butter and oil in a heavy skillet at medium high. Saute
the medallions in small batches until browned, 1 minute per side.
Turn only once. Remove each batch to an ovenproof serving dish; keep
warm in a 225 degree oven.

3.  Prepare the sauce:  put the skillet, with the meat drippings, on
a high heat; add the chicken stock and wine. Bring to a boil, scrap-
ping and stirring until some of the broth evaporates. Keep cooking
the sauce until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 6-8
minutes.

4.  Serve the meat with the sauce spooned over the top of each medal-
lion.
