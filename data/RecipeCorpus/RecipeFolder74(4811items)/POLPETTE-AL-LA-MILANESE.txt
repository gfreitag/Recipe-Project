Categories: Pork, Meats
Yield: 2 Servings
1    Pork fillet, or
Tenderloin (weighing
About 12 oz)
4 oz Minced pork
Sausage meat
1 cl Garlic (crushed
With a little salt)
1 ts Chopped parsley
1 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
Black pepper
Little grated nutmeg
1    Egg (beaten)
1/4 lb Green (?)streaky bacon
1 tb Seasoned flour
2 oz Clarified butter
1    Wineglass white wine
Method Cut the pork fillet into thin slices and flatten out with a
rolling pin or a bottle.  Mix the minced pork, sausage meat, garlic,
parsley, cheese and seasoning together, and add a little beaten egg
to bind. Spread out the bacon rashers with a knife blade. Put a layer
of the stuffing mixture on to each slice of pork, roll up, wrap in a
slice of the bacon and fasten with a cocktail stick. Dust with a
little seasoned flour. Set oven at 350'F or Mark 4. Heat the butter
in a flameproof casserole, put in the pork rolls and cook gently
until golden brown all over. Pour over the white wine and allow to
reduce to half quantity, then cover the pan tightly and put in the
preset moderate oven for 30-40 minutes. Serve this with a risotto
Milanese and a green vegetables.
