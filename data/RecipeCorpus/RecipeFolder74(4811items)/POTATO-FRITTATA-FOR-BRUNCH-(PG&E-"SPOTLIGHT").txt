Peel potatoes, slice very thinly and set aside. Slice onions very
thinly. Heat oil in a 10 inch nonstick, oven-proof skillet. Layer
potato slices in pan and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes; lower
heat if potatoes begin to brown. Using a pancake turner, turn potato
slices over, sprinkle onions on top and cook for 5 more minutes.
Repeat 2 more times, turning onion with potato, until potatoes have
cooked for 20 minutes total. Onions will be translucent and potatoes
will be soft and slightly golden. Beat eggs with a whisk in a large
bowl. Add rep pepper, salt and pepper, beat again and pour mixture
into skillet. As egg begins to cook and become firm around the edges,
carefully lift edge with a flexible spatula, allowing uncooked egg to
slide under the cooked egg. Cook for 5 minutes on top of the stove.
Then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, place skillet in oven and bake at
350 degrees for 15 minutes, until golden. Loosen frittata from
skillet edge with spatula and slide onto a large serving plate. Cut
into wedges and serve. Frittata can be enjoyed either warm or at room
temperature.
