The only way I do beer chili is make a regular pot, extra hot, and
drink a bunch of beers with it. Very satisfactory that way.

Let it be noted that I disagree with many of the particulars of the
recipe below, but it's a good example of a beer chili.

Brown beef and onion in fat. Add peppers, tomato, beer, stock, cumin,
garlic, pepper, and half the chili powder. Simmer until meat is done,
about 2 hr. Make a paste of the masa and water. Stir this quickly
into the chili. Add the paprika and the rest of the chili powder.
Cook 15 min. Remove Jalapenos and serve.
