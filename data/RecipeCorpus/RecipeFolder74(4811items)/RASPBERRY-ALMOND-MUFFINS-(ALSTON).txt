Categories: Muffins, Breads

The raspberry preserves and almond paste tucked inside these delicate
muffins make them a surprising treat.
About 5 ounces almond paste 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, at room
temperature 3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon baking
powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon almond extract 2 cups
all-purpose flour 1 cup plain yogurt or buttermilk About 1/4 cup
raspberry preserves Heat oven to 350 F. Line muffin pans with foil
baking cups. Cut almond paste into 16 pieces and pat each piece into
a round disk about 1 1/2 inches across.
In a large bowl, beat butter until creamy. Beat in sugar until pale
and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then mix in baking powder,
baking soda, and almond extract.
With a rubber spatula fold in 1 cup of the flour, then the yogurt,
and lastly the remaining flour until well blended.
Spoon about 2 tablespoons of batter into each cup and smooth surface
with your fingers. Top with a level teaspoon of raspberry preserves,
then with a piece of almond paste. Top each muffin with another 2
tablespoons of batter.
Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until lightly browned. Turn out onto a
rack and let stand at least 10 minutes.
