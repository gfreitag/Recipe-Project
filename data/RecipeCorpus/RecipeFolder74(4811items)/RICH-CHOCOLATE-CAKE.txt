Preparations:  Divide sugar and buttermilk as below. Beat egg. Soften
butter.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Butter and flour and 2-inch deep, 8-inch round cake pan and set
aside. Beat 1/2 cup sugar, cocoa, 1/4 cup buttermilk, and vanilla.

In another bowl, combine butter and 1/2 cup sugar; beat until light
and creamy.  Add beaten egg a little at a time, beating until smooth
between each addition. Beat in the cocoa mixture.

Combine cake flour, baking soda, and salt.  Resift together and beat
into the butter/cocoa mixture in two parts alternating with 1/4 cup
buttermilk. Pour batter into prepared pan and bate at 375 degrees for
30 - 35 minutes. Let cake rest a few minutes before turning out onto
a cake rack to cool.

For a glaze:  In a double boiler, melt chocolate, cream, and vanilla.
Stir until smooth and let cool to warm. Pour over cake.

If desire, before glazing, split cake in half and spread your choice
of filling between the layers.
