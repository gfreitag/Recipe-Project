Over 90% of Canada's raspberies come from B.C.s Fraser Valley. Berry
lovers wait in anticipation until the month of July when the first
succulent berries make their appearance.

Bake patty shells in 450 F oven for 25 minutes.  Cool. Whip egg whites
until foamy.  Gradually beat in sugar and continue beating until stiff
meringue forms.  Beat in vanilla. Place patty shells on baking sheet.
Spoon raspberries into bottom of patty shells; top with scoop of ice
cream. Spread meringue over, sealing well all around and mounding at
top. Bake in 450 F oven about 3 minutes until lightly browned. Serve
immediately. Makes 4 servings.
