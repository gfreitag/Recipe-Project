This is _The_ classic raisin sauce. So very simple. So very Good!

Mom used it for the 30's, 40's,50's and the 60's. I 've used this
recipe professionally and at home for 4 decades. _Only compliments!_

God Bless Fanny Farmer and the Boston Cooking School Cookbook!

P.S. I use Heinz White  (apple cider and even a good red wine vinegar
works).
