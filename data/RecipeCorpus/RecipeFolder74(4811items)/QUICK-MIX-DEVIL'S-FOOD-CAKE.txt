Here is another "oldie but goodie" recipe that used to grace the
counters of many a diner along the side of the road. Top this cake
with your favorite chocolate or other frosting.

Melt the chocolate over low heat and set aside to cool. Sift the
flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar together in to a
large mixer bowl. Add the brown sugar, 2/3 cup of sour milk,
shortening, vanilla, and red food coloring to the dry mixture. Beat
on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl several
times while beating. Add the cooled chocolate, 1/3 cup of sour milk
and the eggs and continue to beat, at medium speed, for an additional
2 minutes, or until well blended. Scrape the sides of the bowl
frequently. Pour into 2 9-inch prepared round cake pans. (Prepare by
greasing and flouring two 9-inch round cake pans.) Bake in a preheat
375 degree F. oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until the cake tests done.
Cool in the pan for 5 minutes and turn out on wire racks to finish
cooling until cold. Frost.
