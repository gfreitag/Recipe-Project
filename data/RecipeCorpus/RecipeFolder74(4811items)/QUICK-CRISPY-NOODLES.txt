Title: QUICK CRISPY NOODLES
Categories: Pasta, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
EDEN Safflower Oil

1 pk EDEN Bifun Rice Pasta
These wonderfully easy noodles, enjoyed in Thai and Chinese cooking,
are a gourmet's delight.  Serve with Eden Ponzu Sauce or your
favorite Oriental topping.

Break or cut Pasta into 2 x 4 inch sections for individual servings.
Heat 2-3 inches of oil in a wok or heavy pan until a single strand
puffs instantly when placed in the oil. Drop in a portion. The
noodles will quickly puff. Quickly push them into the oil and turn
them over until all strands are puffed (about 15-20 seconds). Drain
on absorbent paper. Repeat process. Keep noodles warm in a 200 F oven
until all portions are cooked.
