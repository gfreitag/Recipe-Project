Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Main dish, Pork
Yield: 1 Batch
1 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Vegetable oil
4    Loin pork chops, 3/4" thick
-- trimmed of excess fat
1 c  Beef stock
1/2    To 2/3 cup sour cream
1/2 ts Caraway seed; or to taste
Salt and pepper; to taste
1 tb Fresh parsley; chopped
In large, heavy saute pan, heat butter and oil.  Add chops and brown
over fairly high heat on both sides to seal in juices. Reduce heat
and cook uncovered to desired doneness (about 15 minutes). Remove
chops to heated platter; keep warm.

Remove excess fat from pan and place over medium-high heat. Add beef
stock to deglaze pan, scraping up any meat bits from bottom. Cook 10
to 15 minutes to reduce until thickened. Remove from heat (turning
heat to low) and blend in sour cream.

Add any juices which may have accumulated around chops. Return sauce
to low heat - do not let boil. Add caraway seed, salt and pepper.
Serve sauce over chops, sprinkled with chopped parsley.

Yield: 3 to 4 servings.  Good served with German spatzle.
