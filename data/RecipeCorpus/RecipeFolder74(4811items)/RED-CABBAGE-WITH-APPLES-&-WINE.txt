Recipe by: dz234@cleveland.freenet.edu (Helen B. Greenleaf) Cook
cabbage in butter in covered pan for 5 minutes. In a casserole dish,
layer 1/3 of the cabbage, apples, onions, garlic and spices. Repeat
three times until all those ingredients are used. Sprinkle brown
sugar over top and add vinegar and wine. Cover and bake at 300 - 350
degrees F until tender. Add more wine if necessary.

Note:  once you've made it, you can adjust the seasonings, etc. It is
absolutely one of our favorites with pork or duck. My German friends
used bacon grease instead of the butter, so that's another option.
