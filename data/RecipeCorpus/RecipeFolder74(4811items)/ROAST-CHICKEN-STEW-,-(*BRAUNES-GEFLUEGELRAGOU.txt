This recipe is perfect for those of us who get home dead tired,
desperately tired but with no desire to actually *cook* anything. The
gravy can be cooked ahead of time and refrigerated or frozen: or made
on the spot, if you feel energetic.  The chicken you can roast
yourself (again, if you feel like it) or pick up from the nearest
place which roasts chickens and wraps them up for passersby (often
using the kind of oven-with-rotating-spits which Peter refers to as
"the chicken-torturing device"). Serve with mashed potatoes or
noodles: or, if you have energy enough, dumplings.

Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed non-reactive saucepan: add the
chopped onions and cook until translucent. Add the flour, and cook
until the *roux* is golden brown.  Pour in the beef stock and port.
Add lemon slices, bay leaves, salt and pepper.  Allow the sauce to
cook for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, then pour through a
fine strainer, test for seasoning, and add vinegar and salt or pepper
to taste. Add the chicken pieces and heat over a low flame.

Re:  the gravy:  There's never enough of it.  If I were you, I'd
double the recipe.  You can always freeze what you don't use.
