Title: POCKET SOUP - GOLDBECK
Categories: Soups
Yield: 18 Servings
2 tb Split peas, dried
2 tb Cracked wheat
1/4 c  Dehydrated vegetable flakes
;(soup greens)
2 ts Sesame seeds
2 ts Sunflower seeds
1 ts Nutritional yeast
1/2 ts Salt
Grind split peas, cracked wheat, vegetable flakes and seeds in blender
until they are a fine powder. Combine ground mixture with yeast and
salt. Store in a covered container at room temperature. To use, add 1
heaping teaspoon soup mix to 6 ounces of boiling water, or 2 level
teaspoons to 1 cup boiling water. Stir, let sit a few minutes, and
serve. Makes 3/4 Cup dried soup mix - enough for 18 cups of soup.
Note: this is one of those times when a blender seems to do a much
more efficient job than the food processor. Note 2: Those who enjoy
an instant cup of broth but are dismayed by the use of flavor
enhancers and the abundance of salt in commercial brands may welcome
the chance to make their own soup mix.
