MMMMM---------------------GARLIC-ONION SOUP--------------------------
2 lg Garlic cloves
1 1/2 lb Onions (5 medium)
2 1/2 tb Butter
1/4 c  Red wine
1/4 ts Dried thyme
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1 qt Chicken stock (or canned

GARLIC-ONION SOUP:  Peel and mince the garlic.  Peel and thinly slice
the onions (food processor preferred). Heat the butter in a large,
deep skillet. Add garlic and onions; cover and cook over medium heat,
stirring occasionally, until onions soften, about 8 minutes. Uncover
and saute until golden, about 5 minutes longer. Add thyme, salt,
pepper, and chicken stock. Bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and
simmer to blend flavors, about 5 minutes.

RED-WINE CROUTONS:  Cut the bread on the diagonal into four 1-inch
thick slices.  Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet. Add
the bread and saute on both sides until light brown, about 2 minutes.
Drizzle the wine and remaining oil over the croutons and top them
with the cheese slices.  Cover and cook over medium heat until the
cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes.

SERVING:  Ladle soup into warm soup bowls and top with the croutons.
Pass the Parmesan cheese separately.
