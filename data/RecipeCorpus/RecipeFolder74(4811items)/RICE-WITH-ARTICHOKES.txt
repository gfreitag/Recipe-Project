Risotto Coi Carciofi To quote the author," In Pitigliano it was
traditionally served during Passover*, when artichokes are in season
and tender". *"Other differences (between Italian Jews and Ashkenazic
Jews) stem from the fact that some foods are not considered kosher by
the Ashkenazim are permitted by the Italkim or Sephardim and vice
versa. For example, rice, which was a staple for us at Passover, is
considered chamtaz, or leavened food, by the Ashkenazim, whereas
chocolate, cheese, and other milk products, so widely used by the
American Jews during Passover, were absolutely forbidden for us,
because we considered them to be chametz." Trim artichokes; remove
any choke and slice very thin. Heat oil thoroughly in a large skillet
and add the artichoke slices. Season with 2 teaspoons salt and pepper
to taste. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently , for
approximately 5 minutes. Lower heat to medium and cook, stirring
frequently, another 10 minutes. Bring 3 cups of water with 1 tsp salt
to a boil. Add rice and cook, covered, for 12 to 15 minutes. Add to
skillet with artichokes and stir to combine. SERVES: 6
