Transfer beef to bowl using slotted spoon.  Repeat with remaining
beef in 4 more batches. Reduce heat to medium.

golden brown, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Stir in chopped
garlic, bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon and allspice.

Return beef to Dutch oven and stir to coat with onion and spice
mixture. Add red wine and bring to boil, scraping up any browned
bits. Simmer mixture 15 minutes. Add beef stock and simmer 10
minutes. Add tomatoes with their juices, breaking up tomatoes with
back of spoon. Mix in olives and rosemary.  Reduce heat to low, cover
and cook until beef is tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2
hours. Add bell peppers, cover and cook until just tender, about 15
minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

in cornmeal.  Continue whisking until mixture boils and thickens,
about 2 minutes.  Reduce heat to low. Cook cornmeal until thick and
thoroughly cooked, whisking occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Set bowl over large saucepan of
barely-simmering water.  Stir occasionally.)
