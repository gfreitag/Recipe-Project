Title: PORK MEDALLIONS SAN REMO
Categories: Pork
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Pork tenderloin
Seasoned flour
1/3 c  Butter
2 T  Oil
1    Lemon
1/3 c  Capers
Parsley sprigs
Skin all fat from the tenderloin and slice thinly. Between wax paper
sheets pound (or roll with a rolling pin) the pork slices until they
are paper thin, and lightly dust them with seasoned flour. Heat the
butter and oil in a skillet until thoroughly hot. SautÂ‚ the pork
until it is well-done and remove.  Turn off the heat, squeeze half of
the lemon through a strainer into the butter and deglaze the pan,
scraping up the crumbs. Return the pork escalopes to pan and add the
capers, coating the meat thoroughly with pan juices. Serve with
fettucine alfredo or buttered noodles as a side dish. Garnish with
parsley and lemon wedges.
