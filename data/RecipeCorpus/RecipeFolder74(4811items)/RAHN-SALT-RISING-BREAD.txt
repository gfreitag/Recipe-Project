1/2 pt Water
1/2 ts Salt
1 qt Milk
1 ts Salt
8 c  Flour (variable)
"Salt rising bread is leavened by the fermentation of flour and milk.
Bacteria are most important actors in this play. The yeast plants of
the air find the batter a good stage for development. Salt rising
bread needs more heat while fermenting and a much longer time to
bake. Here is a good example:"

Stir 2 Tbsp. of corn meal into 1/2 pint of water heated to 130 F. Add
1/2 tsp. of salt and mix very well. Put this in a jar or crock, cover
and place it in a pan of water at 160 F. Keep overnight in a warm
place.

In the morning, warm 1 quart of milk; add 1 tsp. salt and enough warm
flour to make a heavy batter. Gradually add the overnight corn meal
and beat well for a few moments.  Cover and keep in a warm place
about 2 hours.

Gradually add flour and beat mix until it becomes a very soft dough.
Turn out on a floured board and knead until it is elastically smooth.
Divide equally into four portions, mold into loaves, and place each
in a greased bread pan.  Cover with a clean cloth and keep in a warm
place for 1/2 hour. Bake in a 350 F. oven for 1 hour.
