You oughtta try the potato chip sandwich from "White Trash Cooking".

That'll make 'em sit up and take notice.

Spread the mayo generously across the bread.  Pile the potato chips
on to one of the slices as high as you can. Then top it with the
other slice and mash down until all the potato chips are crushed.

Paulie Tickette says:  "Wash it down with a Pepsi, it's some good!"
