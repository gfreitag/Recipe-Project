Title: POLLO CON MOLE VERDE
Categories: Chicken
Yield: 4 Servings
4 lb Chicken, roasting
4 c  Chicken stock; hot
3/4 c  Pumpkin seeds
8    Peppercorns
1/8 ts Cumin seeds
2    Tomatillos
2    Jalape#os; roast/peel/seed
4    Scallion, w/tops
2    Garlic clove; mashed
2 tb Chicken fat or lard
1 bn Mustard greens
2 lg Romaine lettuce leaves
4    Cilantro, fresh; sprig
Put whole chicken in a casser#le, cover with the stock, and bring to a
simmer. Cover pot and poach chicken just below the simmering point
over very low heat or in a very low oven (275 degrees) for 1 hour.
Remove chicken from stock and let it cool enough to carve it.

Toast the pumpkin seeds together with the peppercorns and cumin in a
hot ungreased skillet about 5 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent
scorching. Put into a blender and grind fine.

Remove outer husks from the tomatillos, put them in a pan with cold
water to cover, and bring to a simmer. Simmer 10 minutes, drain, then
add them to the blender with 1/2 cup of their liquid and blend to a
smooth thick puree. Chop all the remaining ingredients and add them
to the blender. Add chicken stock, if needed, to thin the puree. Pour
sauce into the skillet and simmer about 10 minutes to evaporate some
of the liquid.

Carve chicken in 4 or more pieces and add to the sauce, coating the
pieces well.  If possible,let chicken sit overnight in the sauce so
that the seasoning permeates and the hotness of the chili diminishes.
Reheat gently so that sauce does not boil. Serve hot or at room
temperature.
