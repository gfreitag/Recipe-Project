HEAT THE OIL over medium heat on the stove top in a heavy pot with a
lid or a Dutch oven. Add the roast and surround it with carrots,
celery and garlic. If cooking the roast on the stove top, cover the
pot tightly and reduce heat to low. Use a burner heat diffuser if you
have one. If using the oven method, cover tightly and place on the
middle rack of the oven. Cook for 30 minutes. Remove cover, add the
red wine, salt, pepper, bay leaves and thyme. Replace cover and
continue to cook for 2 1/2-to-3 hours. Transfer the roast from the
pot to a baking dish, cover and keep warm in the turned-off or slow
oven for up to 15 minutes. Place the pot on top of the stove over
medium heat and add the broth and butter. Cook, stirring vigorously
until the butter is incorporated. Remove the roast from the oven,
slice into serving pieces and arrange on a serving platter. Strain
the pan juices over the roast, pressing the vegetables against the
sieve or strainer to extract all their juices. Serve immediately and
pass any extra sauce in a sauce boat.
