Categories: Stuffing, Turkey, Poultry
Yield: 2 Servings
10 c  Rice, cooked in chicken
-broth
1 1/2    Sticks butter
3    Garlic cloves, finely
-chopped
1 c  Chopped onion
1/2 c  Chopped bell pepper
2 c  Chopped celery
1 pt Oysters
1 lb Chicken livers
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper (more if
-desired)
1/4    C =TO=
1/3 c  Lea & Perrin's
-Worcestershire sauce
1/2 ts Celery salt
1/2 ts Onion salt
6    Beaten eggs
Melt butter in large skillet. To butter, add garlic, onions, bell
pepper and celery. Saute lightly and remove from pan, retaining
butter. Add oysters and saute in remaining butter. (If oysters are
small, they may remain whole. Large ones can be chopped after
sauteed.) Oysters should be sauteed lightly, just until edges curl.
Remove and set aside. Wash chicken livers thoroughly. Place in pan
and add enough water to just cover them. Boil until done. Drain and
slice finely. Combine everything but eggs into large bowl and mix
together well with your hands. At this time, you can taste to adjust
seasonings. According to personal taste, you might want to add more
of the salts or cayenne. Now add the six beaten eggs and mix together
well. Mixture should hold together without being too wet or dry.
Adjust for moisture by draining liquid or adding additional chicken
broth. Pour mixture into 4-quart casserole. Cover and warm in a
325-deg. oven for about 20 minutes. You can also stuff a 25 pound
turkey and cook. This recipe may be a side dish and serves 15 people.
