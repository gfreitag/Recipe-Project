Categories: Condiments, Fruits, Harned 1994, Salsas, Vegetables
Yield: 3 Servings
6 lg Roma tomatoes; tops removed
1    Garlic clove
2 tb Lime juice (1 Mexican lime)
3 tb Olive oil
2    Serrano peppers; with seeds
-- minced
1 1/2 tb Cilantro; minced
3 1/2 tb Spearmint; minced
1/2 ts Each lime and orange zest
1 pn Salt
With a comal or black iron skillet over medium-high heat, cook the
tomatoes until blackened all over. While still warm, pulse tomatoes
with the garlic in a food processor until roughly chopped. Let cool
to room temperature and add the remaining ingredients. Mix together;
let sit at least 30 minutes before using.

Miller writes:  "Ripe red tomatoes roasted on a hot steel comal until
the skins blacken are a basic element of many Mexican salsas. The
smoky flavor adds a complexity to the taste of ripe tomatoes. Mixing
fresh mint as a counterpoint to this cooked flavor creates the
combination of raw and cooked which is one of the classic taste
motifs of Southwestern cuisine. This salsa goes particularly well
with the wild Churro lamb that we serve at Coyote Cafe because it
does not mask the Churro's unique taste."

Goes well with venison chops, grilled pork, grilled marlin and
tortilla chips.
