Grill or broil peppers until charred on all sides.  If using a
broiler, line a baking sheet with a large piece of aluminum foil, big
enough to hang over both ends of baking sheet. Place peppers in a
single layer on top of foil.  Place about 6 inches below broiler
element. Rotate to char all sides.  Remove from oven and enclose in
foil for 5 minutes. Open foil and allow to rest until cool enough to
handle. Remove skin, seeds and core.

To remove pits from olives, press with side of a large-bladed knife:
this will expose pit and it can be easily removed. Or use a cherry
pitter.

In a large bowl, combine all dressing ingredients and stir to
combine. Add all remaining ingredients except bread and garnish;
toss. Cover and marinate for at least 1 hour.

Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Place bread in single layer on baking
sheet or jelly roll pan.  Bake until golden. Cool. Add bread to olive
mixture and toss.  Allow to sit for 10 minutes. Line platter with
mixed greens. Mound olive salad in center.

Note:  Olive mixture (without bread and garnish), can be stored in an
airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
