Start with the onions and peppers. Once each is browned, combine them
together into one pan and continue to cook slowly, covered. Add bay
leaf, salt and pepper at this time.

Cook eggplant next, followed by the zucchini, then the tomatoes with
the garlic.

In large pan, combine all ingredients and cook for 10 minutes. Serve
