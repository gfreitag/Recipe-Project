Title: PRESSURE COOKER PORK CHOPS
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Pork chops (I prefer thick
-ones)
4-6 Potatoes, peeled and
-sliced, somewhat thick
-slices
1/4 c  Water (approx)
1    Onion, chopped
Heat your pressure cooker on med-high and pour enough oil in to coat
bottom.  Once hot, brown the pork chops until dark but not burned
(this renders better gravy and I think they are tastier this way).
Make sure to brown on all sides possible.  Remove chops to a plate
and reduce heat to medium.  Add the sliced potatoes (beware the hot
grease) and the water. Stir to coat the potatoes thoroughly. Add the
onion (don't stir) and put the chops on top of all.  Sprinkle with
salt and pepper if you like. Put the top on and when the cooker
"bell" rocks, set your timer for 20 minutes. Cool the cooker down by
running water over the top. Remove the chops to your serving plate
and potatoes too. The chops will be very tender and the potatoes will
be soaked in the gravy. Serves 4. This is not a real fast recipe
because at medium heat, it takes a while for the pressure to build
enough to rock that bell on your cooker. You can increase the heat
but beware, you might burn those potatoes. My mother used to make
this and it is one recipe I seem to have good success in duplicating.
