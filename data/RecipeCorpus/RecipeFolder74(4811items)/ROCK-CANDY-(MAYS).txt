Rock candy is easy!  You
Don't really need a 'recipe'
Here's how you do
It ..
Take about a cup of water (or more, if you want to make several
pieces of candy), and heat it in a saucepan until it almost boils.
Turn off the heat. Start stirring in granulated sugar, making sure
that each addition is *completely dissolved* before you add more. You
are aiming for a 'supersaturation solution' of sugar in the water.

When you can no longer add sugar to the solution, it is ready. Let it
cool a bit, and then pour it into a tall, narrow jar (or jars).
Suspend a clean piece of cotton string into the center of the syrup.
Tying the top end of the string to a pencil that sits on the rim of
the jar works well. Cover the solution loosely so that dust or other
contaminants will not float into the sugar solution, and put the
whole thing into an out-of-the-way place for two to three weeks.
Don't shake or disturb it.

During that time, larger than normal sugar crystals will form on the
cotton string and possibly in the bottom of the jar. When the
crystals have stopped growing or are as big as you like them, take
the string out, briefly rinse the crystals in clear water and hang
them to dry for a few minutes.  Rock candy!

You can also add food coloring to the sugar solution. The crystals
will pick up a tint on the tips from it, and it looks kind of neat.
