Hazelnuts Oven: Spread one pound shelled hazelnuts in a shallow pan
and roast in a 275 degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, until skins
crack. To remove skins, rub warm nuts with a rough cloth or between
your hands. Microwave:  Cook shelled hazelnuts for 3-4 minutes on
full

power. Follow above instructions for removing skins.
STORAGE: Hazelnuts can be stored at 32-35 degrees for up to 1 year
in a refrigerator. They can also be stored successfully in a freezer
at 27 degrees or lower for 2 years. These recommendations apply to
both inshell and shelled hazelnuts. Shelled hazelnuts are more likely
to pick up odours, if not stored in airtight containers.
