Title: RASPBERRY-CREAM CHEESE COFFEE CAKE *JB
Categories: Desserts, Cakes
Yield: 8 Servings
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Plus 2 Tabl unsalted butter
--at room temperature
1/2 t  Baking powder
1/2 t  Baking soda
1/4 t  Salt
3/4 c  Sour cream
1 t  Almond extract
2 lg Eggs
8 oz Cream cheese, softened
1/2 c  Raspberry perserves
1/2 c  Sliced almonds
Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease and flour the bottom and sides of a
9-inch springform pan.

In a large bowl, combine the flour and 3/4 cup of the sugar. Using a
pastry blender or fork, cut in the batter until the mixture resembles
coarse crumbs. Reserve 1 cup and set aside.

To the remaining crumb mixture, add the baking powder, soda, salt,
sour cream, almond extract and 1 egg. Blend well. With oiled hands,
gently pat the dough over the bottom and 1 1/2 inches up the sides of
the springform pan; the mixture will be a little sticky.

In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese, the remaining 1/4 cup
sugar, and 1 egg.  Blend well.  Pour into the batter-lined pan. In a
small saucepan, warm the preserves. Carefully spoon the preserves
evenly over the cream cheese mixture.  Stir the  sliced almonds into
the reserved crumb mixture and sprinkle over the preserves. Bake for
45 to 55 minutes, or until the cream cheese filling is set and the
crust is deep golden brown. Cool on a rack for 15 minutes, then
remove from the pan. The cake can be served warm or cool, but it
should be stored in the refrigerator.
