Recipe by: Jo Anne Merrill In a small bowl, place warm water and yeast
until yeast is softened. In a large bowl, combine sugar, salt, salad
oil, 3 eggs slightly beaten and about 3-4 cups of flour. Mix with the
yeast mixture, adding more flour if needed, to make a workable dough.
Knead until smooth and elastic. Do not underknead. Place in an oiled
bowl and turn to oil top. Cover and let rise until doubled in size.
Punch down the dough and divide in half. Cut each half into
3    equal parts.

Roll each part into a strip 15-inches long. Place 3 strips on a
greased baking sheet. Braid, fastening strips at each end. Repeat
with second half of dough. Beat remaining egg slightly and brush tops
and sides of dough. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake in preheated 325
degree oven for 30-40 minutes.
