Title: ROYAL HAWAIIAN WEDDING CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Food w/booz, Desserts, Hawaii
Yield: 12 Servings
1 1/2 pk Butter recipe cake mix
1/3 c  Light rum
6 oz Instant vanilla pudding
1 1/2 c  Water
4 ea Jumbo eggs
1/4 c  Salad oil
MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
6 oz Crushed pineapple w/juice
4 oz Instant vanilla pudding
1/3 c  Light rum
2 pt Whipping cream; whipped
Coconut; for garnish
Mix all cake ingredients for cake and divide into (3) 8 or 9 inch
greased and floured cake pans and bake at temperature listed on the
box. Divide each layer into 2 layers-so you end up with 6 layers
total. Soak the pineapple with the rum for about 30 minutes. Mix in
pudding and let sit until in a gelled state. Whip the two pints of
heavy whipping cream, (put metal mixing bowl in freezer along with
beaters before whipping for best results-I also put pints into
freezer for several minutes before whipping too.) Whip cream until
firm-watch it so it doesn't become butter-that's going too far! Then
fold in the pudding mixture into the whipped cream-carefully. Toast
the coconut in oven til lightly browned. Alternate layers of cake
with layers of thick whipped cream. Garnish with toasted coconut and
cover with plastic wrap tightly and place in refrigerator until the
next day. I have found that if you do not wait and let these flavors
meld for atleast 8 hours, you end up taking a bite of cake and
frosting that has pieces of pineapple loaded with rum and just
doesn't taste good
