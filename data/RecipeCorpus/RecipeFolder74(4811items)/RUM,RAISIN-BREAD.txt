1/4 c  Finely chopped pecans (or ot
1/2 c  Raisins
1 1/2 ts Rum flavoring
3 tb Sugar
1 tb Vinegar and water to make 1
2 tb Dry milk
1 1/2 ts Canola oil
1 1/2 ts Yeast
Put vinegar and water in 2 cup measuring cup. Add dry milk and sugar
and stir until dissolved. Put bread flour; soda, salt, and all other
ingredients into bread pan of bread machine. Add wet and dry
ingredients according to YOUR breadmaker's directions. In my
Panasonic, the wet ingr. go in last, and the yeast goes into the
yeast dispenser. I baked this rum/raisin bread on Rapid and it came
out just beautifully! My b'maker bakes a little hot, so I took it out
about 12 min. before the end of the baking cycle. Hope you all try it
and let me know what you think! Bettie DFW TX 01/19 11:53 pm cst
