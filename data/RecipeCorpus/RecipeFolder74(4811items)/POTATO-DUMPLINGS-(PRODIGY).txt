There are varied dumplings in many different cuisines. Here's a
recipe for potato ones. You can steam them alone or add the uncooked
dough to a favorite stew for the last 25 minutes cooking.

SCOOP OUT THE PULP of a baked potato, mash it in a mixing bowl and set
aside. Discard the skin. Combine butter and onions in a small frying
pan over medium heat and cook 5 to 7 minutes or until translucent.
Add them to the potato pulp. Add the flour, egg, baking powder and
salt and mix well. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and
flatten to a 1-inch thickness. Using a knife or cookie cutter, cut
dough into 12 to 14 round pieces. Place the dough rounds in a steamer
and steam for 25 minutes. Serve immediately.

Makes 12 to 14 Dumplings
