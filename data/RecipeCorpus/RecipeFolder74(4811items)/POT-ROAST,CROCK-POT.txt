Title: POT ROAST/CROCK-POT
Categories: Beef, Main dish, Casserole
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Chuck roast; trimmed
1 pk Lipton onion soup mix
2 1/2 c  Water
1 ea Med Onion; sliced
1 ea Sm Carrot; cut into 3 pieces
2 ea Celery; chopped
1 c  Garlic
2 ea Sm Red potatoes
I like to brown the meat and the veggies, it gives the gravy more
flavor. It's not absolutely necessary though. Place the meat into the
crockpot, then the veggies; sprinkle on the onion soup mix and pour
water over the top. Cover and cook on LOW for 8-10 hours or until
meat is tender. Once the meat is done, if you want to thicken the
gravy, remove the meat and veggies from the pot and place them on a
serving platter. Mix together 2 tablespoons flour (I like Wondra
Flour, it never lumps...no need to mix with water) and 2-3
tablespoons water to make a paste; whisk the paste into the hot
liquid until thickened. You may want to put the temperature on HIGH
when you make the gravy. It might be hard to find a 1-1/2 lb roast
but it's not impossible. There are only two of us and I always make a
big roast and freeze the leftovers or make other dishes with it
(burritos, noodle casseroles, enchiladas, etc). If I remember any
other good ones I've tried, I'll be sure to pass them on to you. Good
luck in your quest. FROM: ELLIE COLLIN   (CMKD93F)
