Preheat oven to 400 degrees.Wash chicken and pat dry with paper
towels. Twist wings back and underneath.Combine chopped tarragon and
butter with a fork until soft.
Gently,using just fingers,loosen the skin from the breast
meat,pulling away the thin membrane that joins them.You can
eventually work your way to the legs and partially separate the skin
there as well.Distribute tarragon butter mixture under the skin until
the whole area is mostly covered.Season the chicken outside and in
the open cavity with salt and pepper.Stick a sprig of tarragon in the
cavity;tie the legs together with twine or skewer them.
Place chicken,breast up,in a small roasting pan large enough to
hold it and the vegetables snugly.Distribute onions,potatoes and
carrots around chicken.Add wine.Place in the middle level of oven and
cook for 20 minutes.Turn oven to 350 degrees;baste chicken and
vegetables with pan juices.Cook for another 20 minutes and baste
again.Ten minutes later,pour sherry vinegar over chicken and
baste.Cook another 10 to 12 minutes.Baste again and add 1/4 cup
water.Cook about 10 minutes longer.Chicken is done if the leg joint
moves easily and juices run yellow when flesh is pierced with a
fork.Garnish with tarragon leaves.
