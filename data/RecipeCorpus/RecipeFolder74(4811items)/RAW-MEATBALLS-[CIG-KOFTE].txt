250 g  Fine bulgur

Wash and drain the bulgur. Grate the onions, chop the parsley and mix
them together. Skin and dice the tomatoes and add to the onions and
parsley. Put the salt, black pepper, red pepper, allspice and cumin
into the mixture, and blend by mixing with the hand a couple of times
and set aside. Put the meat and bulgur on a large tray and make into
a apste by kneading. Moisten hands with cold water occasionally while
kneading. Add the prepared mixture of onion, tomatoes and spices to
the meat and knead to make a paste. Take small pieces of the mixture
and press with the palm to flatten it, and put on a serving plate.
Decorate with lettuce and parsley before serving. It is recommended
that you prepare raw meatballs just before serving, because if they
are allowed to stand for a long time, the taste is spoiled.

Note: bulgur is a kind of Turkish wheat, available in Turkish
groceries.
