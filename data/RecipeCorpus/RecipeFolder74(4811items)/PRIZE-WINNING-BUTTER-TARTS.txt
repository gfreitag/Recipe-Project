1/2 ts Baking powder
1/3 c  Cold ice water
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Shortening
MMMMM------------------FILLING FOR BUTTER TARTS-----------------------

1/3 c  Butter or margarine, melted
-(butter is best of course)
1 c  Brown sugar
2 tb Milk
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Raisins
1    Pastry recipe
Combine the dry ingredients. Cut in the shortening. Add the water a
little bit at a time, adding just enough to bind it together without
overmixing it. Handle it as little as possible. Roll it out, and use
a a round cookie cutter to cut the circles, matching the size to your
muffin tins. Using your fingers, pleat them to fit in the muffin tin.
When you look straight down at the tin, it will look like a flower
with four petals. Cover the raisins with water and heat to the
boiling point. Let them sit a minute or two to fluff up and then
drain. Combine remaining ingredients in a separate bowl. Divide your
raisins equally between your tart shells. Pour filling over raisins,
filling each tin 2/3 full. Bake at 450 degrees for 8 minutes, then at
350 degrees for 5 - 10 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool and
enjoy!! YIELD 12 TARTS
