1/3 c  Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
1 1/2 oz Unsweetened Baking Chocolate
1 tb Canola Oil
6 lg Egg Whites
1 1/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Unsweetened Applesauce

Preheat oven to 350Ã¸F. Spray 9 x 9" baking pan with oil and wipe off
excess, or use nonstick pan. Sift together flour and cocoa powder. Set
aside. Melt chocolate in double boiler. When melted, turn off heat
and add oil. Mix until combined. Cool slightly.

Beat egg whites on high with sugar until very fluffy. Add applesauce,
yogurt, vanilla extract, melted chocolate, and dry ingredients. Lower
speed and continue beating until well incorporated. Pour mixture into
baking pan and bake for 20-25 minutes. The center of the mixture will
feel firm and not liquidy when touched lightly. A toothpick inserted
will come out covered with batter, not clean. Cool and serve chilled.
