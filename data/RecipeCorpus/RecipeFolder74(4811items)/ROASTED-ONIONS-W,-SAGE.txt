Categories: Low, Fat
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Onions (any kind you like)
1    Dozen fresh sage leaves(1
ts Dried)
1 ts Coarsely ground pepper
Salt to taste (I use 1/4-1/2
Tsp)
3    4 tbs balsamic vinegar
Parsley, chopped, for
Garnish
Preheat oven to 375. Spray a large baking dish (at least 9 by 13)
with Pam ~ olive oil Pam is nice. Peel onions and slice them into
rounds about 1/2 " or more thick. Separate the rings then toss them
with the sage, pepper, salt and vinegar. Heap the seasoned onions in
the baking dish, spray lightly with pam and cover with foil and bake
for 30 min. Remove the foil, give the onions a stir, cover and return
to the oven. After 15 min, stir again (they should be starting to
brown all over) and return to the oven, uncovered, 20 min or more or
until the juices reduce to a syrup and the onions are caramelized.
Heap them in a bowl and garnish with parsley.
