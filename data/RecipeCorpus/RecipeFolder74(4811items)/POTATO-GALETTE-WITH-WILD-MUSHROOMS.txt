Title: POTATO GALETTE WITH WILD MUSHROOMS
Categories: None
Yield: 3 Servings
6 oz Wild mushrooms, cleaned
2 1/2 oz Goose fat or olive oil
Salt and pepper
3    Cloves garlic, chopped
2    Shallots, chopped
2 tb Parsley, chopped
1 lb Potatoes, peeled
8 inch heavy frying pan
This galette was layered with fresh truffles in the days when they
were cheap, but other fungi, particularly cepes, are a very acceptable
substitute. Even cultivated mushrooms enliven an otherwise plain fried
potato cake.  (Sherri's note, I used two jars of dried wild mushrooms
(because I doubled the recipe) reconstituted with white wine
overnight then drained). Cut the mushrooms in large pieces. Heat 2
tablespoons of the fat or oil in a frying pan and add the mushrooms,
salt and pepper. Saute briskly, stirring, until the mushrooms are
tender and all moisture has evaporated; cooking time varies with the
type of mushroom. Stir in the garlic, shallots and parsley and taste
for seasoning.

Preheat the oven to No. 5/375 degrees F./190 degrees C. Cut the
potatoes in 1/8 inch/3mm slices, if possible using a mandolin slicer
or a food processor, do not rinse potatoes after they are sliced.
Heat 2 tablespoons of the fat or oil in the frying pan for 1 minute.
Remove and arrange half the potato slices overlapping in circles.
Sprinkle them with salt and pepper and spread the mushrooms on top.
Cover the mushrooms with the remaining potatoes and spoon over the
remaining fat. Press a piece of foil with a weight on top.

Cook the galette on top of the stove until the underside starts to
brown, 5 ~ 8 minutes.   Transfer it to the heated oven and continue
cooking for 15 - 20 minutes until the potatoes are tender.

Remove the foil and weight and flip the galette in the pan.
Alternatively, slide it on to a plate, then tip it back into the pan.
Continue cooking it until the underside is brown. It is best served
at once, though it can also be reheated.
