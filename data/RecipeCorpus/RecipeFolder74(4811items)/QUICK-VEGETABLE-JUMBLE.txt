Title: QUICK VEGETABLE JUMBLE
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 1 Servings
1    10-oz brick frozen spinach,
Thawed and somewhat
Drained
2    15-oz cans corn, somewhat
Drained
1    15-oz can Italian white
Kidney beans (or substitute
Great Northerns)
MMMMM---------------------SEASONING OPTION 1--------------------------
3 ts Canned chopped garlic
(Polaner brand is packed in
Water)
(or 1*tsp garlic powder)
1 ts Black pepper
2 ts Dehydrated onion flakes
MMMMM---------------------SEASONING OPTION 2--------------------------
1/2 ts Paprika
2 ts Italian seasoning
MMMMM---------------------SEASONING OPTION 3--------------------------
1/4 c  Bottled Italian or
Vinaigrette dressing
(and drain the corn more
Thoroughly)
Rip up the spinach a bit, if it's in huge stringy clumps. Toss
everything together in a bowl.  Let sit for a few minutes if you've
got dry spices in there. Heat up if you feel like it, else eat cold.

I'd like to try this with chopped red bell pepper in it - I think it
would taste good, and I know it would look good...

It would also taste good with kidney or black beans, but the darker
liquid from the beans would make the dish look muddy. Most of my
veggie cooking looks brown (or red) and boring - it's a nice change
to eat something bright and pretty...

Actually, I usually make this with frozen corn...  but I don't measure
that, I just pour it from the bag...
