Title: RASPBERRY BARS
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Flour
1 c  Brown sugar, packed
1 ts Salt
2 c  Quick-cooking oatmeal
1 c  Butter
1 1/2 c  Seedless raspberry jam,*

Bar cookies are easy to prepare because they are spread in a pan and
baked all at one time. They should be cooled before cutting.

This is such an easy recipe-but it tastes like you spent hours
preparing it. It's great for brunch and coffee klatches!

Preheat oven to 375ø.

In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, salt and oatmeal. Cut in all
but two tablespoons butter. Press 1/2 of flour mixture evenly into a
greased 13 x 9-inch pan. Spread jam over batter in pan, then top with
remaining flour mixture. Dot with two tablespoons butter and with
chopped pecans.

Bake at 375ø for 20-25 minutes. Let cool completely, then cut into
rectangles.

Variation: Use other types of jam, such as apricot.
