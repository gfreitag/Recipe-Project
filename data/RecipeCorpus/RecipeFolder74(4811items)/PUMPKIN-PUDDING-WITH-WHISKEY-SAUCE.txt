Drain pineapple, reserving 1/4 cup pineapple liquid; set pineapple

Combine pineapple liquid and raisins in a small glass bowl; microwave
at high 1 minute and 15 seconds or until raisins are plump, and set
aside.

Place sugar and next 3 ingredients in food processor; process 1
minute or until well blended. Add pumpkin; process until smooth. Add
flour and next 6 ingredients; pulse 7 times or until ingredients are
blended. Add pineapple and pecans; pulse 4 times. Add plumped raisin
mixture, and pulse 2 times.

Spoon into a 6-cup steamed-pudding mold coated with cooking spray, and

Let cool on a wire rack 10 minutes. Invert mold onto a serving
platter; slice and serve warm. Top each slice with about 2-1/2
tablespoons Whiskey Sauce. Yield: 10 servings.

mixture. Bring to a boil, and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
