Rice noodles make a delightful alternative to wheat-based noodles -
fine in texture they are light food that is quickly cooked and make a
delicious base for all kinds of mixtures. Here chopped courgettes,
broccoli and okra are flavoured with ginger, garlic and soy sauce:
irresistible food.

Cook the rice noodles in boiling water until they are soft, about 3-4
minutes. Drain.

Steam the finely sliced courgettes, broccoli and okra 'al dente'.
Heat the oil and quickly stir in all the vegetables until they are
coated with it, then mix in the garlic and ginger. Season with the
soy sauce and mix together thoroughly. Toss the cooked rice noodles
into the pan, stir-fry for a further minute or two until they are
well coated, and serve immediately.
