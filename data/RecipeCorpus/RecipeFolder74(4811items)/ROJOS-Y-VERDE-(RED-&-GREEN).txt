This chili is in the style of New Mexico green chile stew.

Remove stems from red peppers and chop into parts to separate out the
seeds and expose interiors. Cover with boiling water and let sit for
an hour. Blend into smooth sauce with blender. Don't get this stuff
in your eyes! Better yet, wear protective clothing during handling
(I'm only half joking!).

Brown the roast as if making pot roast - coat meat with flour and
brown every surface in olive oil. (Theresa says I can do this almost
as well as her Aunt Tia, the Goddess of Pot Roast - but she's just
being kind.) Add chicken broth and water up to one inch deep and
cover. Simmer meat by itself for one hour over low heat.

Lightly blend the tomatillos and three green chilies in blender. Dice
the remaining green chilies, garlic, onion, and tomatoes. Add the
sauces, vegetables, and spices to the pot with enough water to cover.
When the meat is falling-apart-tender (several more hours,
typically), use two forks to shred it into small chunks.

Serve topped with slices of avacado and white cheese, along with
sides of beans and jalapeno cornbread.

Alternate Version - Instead of a beef roast, use buffalo! I tried this
recipe with ground buffalo ("100% American Bison!"), and was mighty
surprised and pleased. I found this meat and a few other exotics at
Whole Foods Grocery, a health food store in Austin. I'll continue to
experiment and report the results.
