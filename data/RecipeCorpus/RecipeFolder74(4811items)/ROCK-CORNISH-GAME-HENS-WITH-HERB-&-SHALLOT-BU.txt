Merle Ellis doesn't provide any more detail on the origins of the game
hens, but he does note that "These delicious little birds didn't even
exist back in the days when Grandma was a girl. Their ancestors did,
the Plymouth Rock hen and the Cornish game cock, but they hadn't
gotten together yet in those days.  That event didn't happen till
around 1950 and since then Rock Cornish Game Hens have become almost
commonplace."

Ah but all may not be as it seems at the old poultry counter! While
discussing the classification of poultry, Ellis states "Young
chickens may be labeled young chicken, broiler, roaster, fryer capon
or Rock Cornish game hen".  So I guess you pays yer money and takes
your chances. Whatever it is that's hanging out around the poultry
bins in Safeway under the guise of Rock Cornish game hens, they're
good!

Preheat oven to 350F.  Cut each hen in half, sprinkle all over with
salt and pepper, and bring to room temperature. Melt butter in small
fry pan and add shallots, rosemary and thyme. Stir well and let
bubble for about 5 minutes, then remove from heat. Place hens in flat
baking pan, skin side up, and baste with the butter sauce. bake for
50 minutes, basting every 15 minutes.  Garnish with parsley.

Serve with wild rice, leaf spinach, and a rose wine.

Makes 4 servings.
