Garganelli is a difficult-to-prepare fresh pasta. For instructions

farfalle.]

dried pasta.  Cook till "al dente" (8-10 min.).

pancetta until the shallots have softened and pancetta begins to
crisp. Add radicchio and saute' until it wilts.

3.  Scrape contents of skillet into a bowl.  Toss to combine
ingredients, season with salt and pepper to taste and serve. From
