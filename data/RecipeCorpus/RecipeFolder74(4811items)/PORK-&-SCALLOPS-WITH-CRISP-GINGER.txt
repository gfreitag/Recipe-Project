Categories: Pork, Meats, Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
1 lb Asparagus
1 lg Red pepper
2    2-3" pieces ginger
1    Pork tenderloin; (about 3/4
-lb)
2 tb Low-sodium soy sauce
2 tb Dry sherry
1 tb Cornstarch
1/2 ts Sugar
1/4 c  Canola oil
1/2 lb Brown mushrooms
1/4 ts Salt; optional
3/4 lb Bay scallops
To remove tough ends from tender asparagus spears--the easy way, hold
base of stalk firmly and bend.  End will snap and break off at just
the right spot for the best eating.

About 1 hour before serving, discard tough ends from asparagus, trim
scales, cut diagonally into 3-inch pieces. Cut pepper into strips.
Peel ginger; grate 1 teaspoon. Cut remaining ginger lengthwise into
very thin slices; cut slices into hair-thin strips.  Cut pork
tenderloin into 1/8-inch-thick slices.  In bowl, mix pork, soy sauce,
sherry, cornstarch, sugar, and grated ginger.

In 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, in hot oil, cook ginger
strips about 1 minute or so until it has a light browned color.
Remove ginger with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. In oil
remaining in skillet, cook asparagus, red pepper, mushrooms, and salt
(optional) until vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring quickly and
frequently. With slotted spoon, remove vegetables to plate.

In oil remaining in skillet over high heat, cook pork mixture over
high heat a minute or so.  Add scallops and cook until pork loses its
pink color and scallops are tender about 2 to 3 minutes, adding a
little more oil if it is needed.  Return vegetables to skillet;
stir-fry until heated through. Spoon pork mixture onto platter;
sprinkle with ginger strips. Makes 6 servings.

Note: Meat slices more easily if it is frozen slightly (about 40
minutes). You can hold your knife on a slant and slice across the
width to get nicely uniform pieces.
