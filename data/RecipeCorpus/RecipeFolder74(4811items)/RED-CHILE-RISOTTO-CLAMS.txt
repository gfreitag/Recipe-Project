Scrub the clams and discard any dead ones, (See Recipe 16). In a wide
bottomed stainless steel or enamel pan, place the sliced garlic,
parsley, 4 cups of water, wine, and the clams in a single layer.
Cover and bring to a boil, simmer over low heat until the clams open
up, no more than 4 to 5 minutes.  Turn the heat off and let sit for a
further 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the clams from the broth and extract
the meat from the shells. Open any clam shells that remain closed
with a knife over a separate bowl, in case any are bad. Allow the
broth to cool, remove the garlic and parsley, and strain, if
necessary to remove sand or other foreign particles. Combine the
broth with enough clam juice to equal 11 cups of liquid. Saute the
onion with 3 tb of butter, over medium heat in a large pan, until
soft, about 15 minutes.  Add the rice and cook for 5 minutes, over
medium heat, stirring constantly (Cooking any longer will make the
rice tough). Add 2 cups each of water and clam juice, alternating 1
cup of water, 1 cup of juice, stirring continuously. This should be
absorbed after about 10 minutes or so, then add, alternately in 1/2
cup increments, 2 cups of water and 1 cup of clam juice, stir and
allow to absorb for another 5 to 10 minutes. At this stage the rice
should be about 1/2 cooked. (If preparing this dish ahead of time,
stop at this point and lay out the rice on a long flat sheet pan to
prevent it gumming together.) Add the minced garlic, tomatoes, and
chile powder and continue stirring and cooking over medium heat for
10 minutes.  Then add a further 4 cups of clam juice, 1/2 cup at a
time.  Add the peppers and add another 3 cups of clam juice, in 1/4
cup increments and allow to absorb for 8 to 10 minutes. Add the clams
and the remaining 1 cup of clam juice in 1/4 cup increments and allow
the liquid to absorb for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the pan from the
heat, stir in the remaining butter and cheese and garnish with
parsley sprinkled on top. Serve hot.
