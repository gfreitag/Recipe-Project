From "A Book of Feasts" by Kay Goldstein and Liza Nelson (Longstreet
Press, 1993).

Soak apricots in wine in a dish and set aside.

Rinse chicken pieces under cold water and pat dry. Season the chicken
with the dry seasonings and place pieces in a single layer in a large
roasting pan. Add onions and carrots. Bake in a preheated 350'F. oven
for 45 minutes, or until the chicken is just beginning to brown. Pour
off excess fat, if desired, and pour apricots and wine over chicne
pieces. Baste with juices (adding more wine, if needed), and finish
cooking, about 30 minutes longer; remove from oven. If not served
within 2 hours, chill and bring back to room temperature before
reheating.

To reheat, place the chicken in covered pan or ovenproof serving dish
with cooking juices (you may skim fat again) and reheat at 375'F. for
20-30 minutes while first courses are being served. To serve, place
the chicken pieces on a serving dish and keep warm while deglazing
the pan. Scrape up pan residues, adding a bit more stock or wine to
deglaze if necessary. Pour resulting sauce over chicken and arrange
apricots for garnish.
