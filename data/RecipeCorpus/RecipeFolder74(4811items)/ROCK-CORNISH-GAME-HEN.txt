*This recipe, to be baked in a clay pot, is made in several stages. In
fact, the game hen can be deboned the day before it is cooked. Use the
bones for stock, as dirested and prepare the stuffing for the hens
the day they are to be cooked.  Make the clay for sealing before
stuffing the hens.

DEBONING THE GAME HEN: Using a sharp boning knife, split the hen from
the

buttuckes to the neck. The deboining is easier if the hen is split on
one

side of the backbone, not down the middle. Lay the hen flat on the
board to expose the backbone and rib cage. Pull out the cartiledge in
center. Carefully pull the rib cage out, working the knife between
the rib and the flesh.  Also remove the wishbone. Do not remove bone
from the wings or thighs or legs. Wash and dry hens and refrigerate,
covered, until ready to use.

GAME HEN STOCK: Press the onion, cut side down, on a hot surface
until well browned, Place onion and bones in baking pan and bake at
350 degrees F for 20 minutes.    Combine celery, water, bouillon, and
baked bones in a saucepot.  Boil, uncovered, to reduce liquid to 1/2.
Set aside.

VELOUTE SAUCE: Heat butter in small saucepan and blend in flour. Stir
in stock gradually.  Cook and stir with a whisk until thickened and
smooth. Ass remaining ingredients, Set aside.

STUFFING FOR GAME HENS: Put bread slices in blender or food processor
with steel blade and process to make medium crumbs.  Set aside.
Remove skins from the sausage and crumble. Fry in a skillet until
browned. Add celery and onions and continue cooking until celery and
onions are tender. Add bread crumbs and remaining ingredients and mix
throughly. Set aside.

CLAY FOR SEALING POTS: Mix dry ingredients. Mix food colouring with
ater.

gradually stir into the flour mixture until it reaches the
consistancy of a biscuit batter. Mix well and set aside.

TO ASSEMBLE THE DISH: Spread hens out flat, sink sides down. Divide
stuffing between hens, shaping stuffing into balls. Bring hens up
around the stuffing and shape into a ball. Heat Veloute Sauce and
pour into the clay pot. Lay hens, breast side up, into Veloute Sauce.
Cut each sausage into 3 pieces and place around hens. Cover and seal
edges of pot with clay. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour.
