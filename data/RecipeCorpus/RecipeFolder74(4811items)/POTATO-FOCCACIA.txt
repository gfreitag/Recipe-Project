Categories: Bakery, Italian, Breads, Snacks, Mark's
Yield: 1 Foccacia
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1/2 tb Yeast
1 c  Lukewarm water
1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
2 ts Parsley
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Wheat germ
3 c  Flour
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
3 md Potatoes, diced
1 1/2 tb Olive oil
Salt & pepper
Olive oil, for brushing
Parsley, chopped
In a mixing bowl, combine the yeast, water, sugar, salt, oil &
parsley. Let stand until the yeast starts to froth. Mix in the wheat
germ & 1 c flour. Beat well & let sit for 5 minutes. Knead in the
remaining flour & knead until the dough is soft & pliable. Lightly
oil a clean bowl & cover with a towel.  Let rise until doubled in
bulk.

Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet & saute the potaotes until
they are soft.  Remove from heat & set aside. Preheat oven to 350F.

Roll out the dough to fit into a cookie sheet or on a pizza stone.
Lightly sprinkle the cookie sheet with cornmeal & place the dough on
the sheet. Stretch into the corners & build up the edges slightly.
Let rest for 10 minutes.

Brush the dough with olive oil & spread the potatoes over the top.
Generously salt & grind fresh black pepper over the top & finish with
the fresh parsley. Bake for 25 minutes or until the crusts are done.
Cut up & serve immediately or let cool.  This is equally good cold &
served at room temperature.

NOTE: I think that this recipe still needs something to pick it up a
little if you have any ideas, please let me know. It is based on a
recipe a friend of mine ordered in Glasgow in an Italian Restaurant,
she apparently orders it a lot, I had never seen it before. There is
a lot of starch, but don't let that put you off. I found it better
cold than hot, but that may be my preference.
