Title: RHUBARB FOOL
Categories: Desserts, Low fat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Fresh rhubarb
Juice and rind of one
Orange
Sugar to taste
1    Sachet gelatine
Cream substitute of some
Sort: yogurt, fromage frais,
Evaporated milk,
Whatever
Stew the rhubarb with the orange rind/juice, sugar, and as little
water as you can get away with.  Melt in the gelatine (if you are
vegetarian or vegan, use another gelling agent), and then put through
food processor to make puree.  Add the cream substitute - I would use
fromage frais, but yogurt is fine, or you might like whisked
evaporated milk, if you like the taste.  Then refrigerate until set.

If, like me, the mere thought of rhubarb sets your teeth on edge
(it's one of the very few things I really can't eat!), then use a
different fruit - gooseberries, perhaps, or dried apricots.
Gooseberries are nicest if stewed with elderflowers, if you can get
them, and dried apricots don't need any help. I've not quoted
quantities for the sugar, because it depends on your taste.
