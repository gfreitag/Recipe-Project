2 lb Ground pork
1/4 c  Grated parm cheese
1/3 ts Rubbed sage
1/8 ts Allspice
Pinch of cayenne
1/4 c  Dry red wine

1. Put the pork in a mixing bowl and add the cheese, sage, allspice
and cayenne. Add the wine and blend well with hands. 2. Divide the
mixture into 8 portions of equal size. Shape into balls and then
flatten into patties. If the caul fat is used, cut the sheets into 8
6-in. squares and wrap each patty neatly in a square of fat. 3. Heat
the oil in a skillet and add the patties. Cook over relatively high
heat until browned on one side, about 2 min. Turn and cook until
nicely browned on the other side. Reduce the heat and continue
cooking about 12-15 min. 4. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.
