Categories: New, Text, Import 	ess, Of, Emeril
4    (6-oz) red snapper fillets
Essence
Yield: 4 Servings
:
1/4 c  Dijon mustard
2 lg white potatoes, -- peeled,
cut crosswise
Salt and white pepper
:
:
4 TB olive oil
Garnish:
:
1 c  red pepper coulis, -- hot
1 c  yellow pepper coulis, -- hot
1/2 c  fried herb salad
1 TB finely chopped parsley

Season each fillet with Essence. Lightly brush each fillet with the
Dijon mustard. Pass each halved potato through the potato threader or
grate potatoes using a box grater. Place the threaded potatoes in a
mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Divide the threaded
potatoes into 4 portions. Wrap each fillet with each individual
portion of the threaded potatoes. Wrap the fish like a package. Wrap
crosswise first and then lengthwise. Wrap the crusted fish tightly in
a cloth napkin. This will secure the potato to the fish. In a large
saute pan, heat the olive oil. When the oil is hot, saute the fish
for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden. Remove from the pan
and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the fish with Essence.

Yield: 4 serving
