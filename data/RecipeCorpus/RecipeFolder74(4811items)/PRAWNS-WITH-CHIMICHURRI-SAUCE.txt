Title: PRAWNS WITH CHIMICHURRI SAUCE
Categories: Seafood, Sauce, Bar-b-q
Yield: 6 Servings
2    To 10 cloves garlic, peeled
And coarsely chopped
1    Red jalapeno pepper, stemmed
Seeded and coarsely chopped
1/4 c  Fresh oregano leaves
1 c  Fresh parsley leaves
1/4 c  Red-wine or sherry vinegar
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 lb Jumbo prawns
1. Prepare the garlic.  Traditionally this is a garlicky sauce, but
the amount of garlic used would be according to personal taste. 2.
Combine the garlic and jalapeno in a food processor and mince finely.
Add the oregano and parsley and pulse to a fine chop.  Add the
vinegar, olive oil and salt, processing until smooth and emulsified.
(The sauce can be used immediately; or pour into a jar, cover and
refrigerate until ready to use.) 3. Remove about 1/3 cup of the sauce
to use as a baste for the prawns. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill.
Place prawns on a well-oiled grill, 4 to 6 inches from the source of
heat. Baste and cook about 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until prawns
are pink and cooked through. 4. Serve with the remaining sauce on the
side. Note: The sauce can also be used with beef, chicken or pork.
