Title: ROAST CORNISH GAME HENS STUFFED WITH TWO BASI
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 2 Servings
1 c  Opal basil leaves, fresh
1 c  Sweet basil leaves, fresh
1    Orange; zest & juice only
2    Cornish game hens
Olive oil; for rubbing
Black pepper
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Chop the basils coarsely. Rinse hens and pat dry.

In a bowl, combine the basils, orange zest, and orange juice; mix
well. Tightly pack the basil mixture inside the cavity of each hen.
Tie the legs together with kitchen twine and tuck the wings under.
Rub the hens with olive oil and sprinkle with black pepper. Place,
breast side up, on a roasting rack set inside a lightly greased
roasting pan.

Roast for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and rotate the hens so
that the breasts face down. Roast for 30 minutes longer. To check for
doneness, prick the under side of the thighs with a sharp fork; if
the juices run clear, the hens are done. Remove from the oven and let
stand at room temperature for 5 minutes before serving.
