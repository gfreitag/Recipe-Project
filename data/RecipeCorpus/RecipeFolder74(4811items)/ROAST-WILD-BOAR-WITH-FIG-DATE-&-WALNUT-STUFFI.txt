Combine stuffing ingredients in a food processor and chop coarsely.
Set aside.

Remove the bone from the boar hind and meticulously clean tendons and
fat from inside the leg. Stuff with half the stuffing mixture and
neatly reform the leg to its original shape. Using butcher's twine,
truss the boar. Rub the surface of roast with a bit of olive oil;
season with thyme and salt. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting
pan. Roast in a 350 degree F. oven approx- imately I hour, or until
the internal temperature reaches 140 degree F.

Remove roast from oven and let rest 20 minutes before carving.

Sauce: Combine port, Zinfandel, sugar and figs in a heavy bottomed
saucepan. Cook over high heat until the mixture reaches the
consistency of a conserve. Puree in a blender, and strain through a
fine sieve. Set aside.

Combine shallots and a splash of port in a heavy-bottomed saucepan
and cook until almost dry. Add the fig-port syrup and demi-glace.
Cook until reduced by half. Season with salt and whisk in butter.

Carve roast and garnish each serving with a portion of the remaining
stuffing, a bit of sauce and, if desired, fresh black figs.
