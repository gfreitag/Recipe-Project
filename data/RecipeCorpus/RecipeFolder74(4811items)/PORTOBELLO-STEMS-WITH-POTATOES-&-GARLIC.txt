Cleaned stems from
4 lg Fresh portobellos
Sliced in 1/2" rounds

Slice the potatoes into 1/8-to-1/4-inch-thick round. Then slice the
rounds again into matchstick-size pieces, 1/8-1/4-inch-wide and about
2-3 inches long. Keep covered with cold water until ready to use.

Place the oil in a large saute pan. Heat over medium heat, and then
add the potatoes. Fry the potatoes until they begin to brown, about 4
min. Add the onion and garlic and continue to fry until the potatoes
begin to soften, about 5 min more. Add the mushroom stems and
continue to fry, adding more oil if the mixture is too dry. When the
mushrooms begin to go limp, in about 3 min, add the paprika and salt
to taste. Sprinkle parsley on top and serve.
