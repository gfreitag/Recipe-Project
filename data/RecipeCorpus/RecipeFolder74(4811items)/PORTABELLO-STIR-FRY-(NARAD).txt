2    Portabello Mushrooms
(cut up)
1    Carrot, sliced about 1/4"
Thick
1 md Zucchini, sliced about 1/4"
Thick
1/2    Head broccoli, cut into

Sliced 1/4" thick
1 cn Sliced water chestnuts
1/2 lb Extra firm tofu, drained and
Cut into 1/2" cubes
x  Anything else that seems
Like a good idea at the
Time
1 tb Mellow brown rice miso
Paste
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1 ts Fresh ginger, minced
1/8 ts Chinese 5-spice mix
2 ts Soy sauce
1 c  Warm water
1 tb Cornstarch, dissolved in a
Few tbs hot water
1    Splash of sake or white wine
Or dry sherry
1    To 2 tbs peanut oil
Dissolve the miso in the water.  Dissolve the cornstarch in a small
amount of hot water and add to the miso, along with the soy sauce and
5-spice mix. Set aside.

Heat the wok, then add the oil; heat for a minute and swirl around to
coat the wok.  Add the garlic and ginger, stir around until the
garlic starts to brown. Add the mushrooms, toss for about 3 minutes
until they start to soften.  Add the carrots, stir for about 2
minutes; then the broccoli, another minute; then the water chestnuts,
another minute; then the tofu. Add a splash of sake, stir for another
minute or two as the steam melds everything, then pour on the sauce.
Stir until it thickens (about 3 minutes), then serve with rice or
noodles.

The portabellos have a chewey, firm body and a rather strong flavor,
very nice!  I think next I'll try some kind of dish mixing whole caps
with eggplant...I'll let you know in a week or so!

as always, "eat! eat!"
