GENERAL DIRECTIONS
FOOD PROCESSOR: Place roasted hazelnuts in food processor container
with all-purpose blade. Process to coarse butter texture, about 3
minutes. Gradually add sugar, salt or other ingredients through feed
tube. Scrape down sides; continue to process until desired texture is
achieved, 4 to
7    minutes.

BLENDER: Place roasted hazelnuts and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in
blender container and grind to meal on low speed. Continue to blend
on low for several minutes, scraping down sides of container as
required and adding another tablespoon of oil, if necessary. When
butter is fairly fluid, blend on high for 2 to 3 minutes or until
