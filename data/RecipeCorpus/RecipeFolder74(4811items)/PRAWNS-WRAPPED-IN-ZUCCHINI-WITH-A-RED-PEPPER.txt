Shell and devein the prawns, leaving the tail segment and it's shell
intact. In a mixing bowl, whisk the marinade ingredients together and
toss with the prawns. Marinate for 1 hour. Meanwhile, blanch the
zucchini slices in lightly salted boiling water for 5 seconds. Remove
and immediately plunge into cold water to stop the cooking. Drain,
pat dry and set aside.

Place a basil leaf on top of each prawn. Curl a zucchini slice around
the prawn, enclosing the basil leaf. Thread a bamboo skewer or
rosemary branch through the prawn and zucchini slice to hold in
place. Grill or broil the prawns approximately 3 minutes, turning
once, until just done. Be careful not to overcook. Serve immediately,
garnished with a dollop of Red Pepper Aioli, basil sprigs and lemon
wedges.
