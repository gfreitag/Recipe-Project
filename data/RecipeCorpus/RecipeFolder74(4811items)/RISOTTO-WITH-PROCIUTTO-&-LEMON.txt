Title: RISOTTO WITH PROCIUTTO & LEMON
Categories: Appetizers, Italian, Rice
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Lemon Peel -- julienne
4 tb Unsalted Butter
3/4 c  Onion -- finely chopped
1    Garlic Clove -- bruised
2 oz Paper-Thin Slices Of
Prosciutto -- chopped *
1 c  Arborio Rice -- (plus 2 Tbsp
1/2 c  Dry White Wine
3 1/2 c  Chicken Stock -- (about)
1/2 c  Freshly Grated Parmesan
Cheese
Blanch lemon peel in small saucepan of boiling water 15 seconds.
Drain. Repeat blanching process twice using fresh water each time.
Alternatively, place peel in heat proof bowl. Pour boiling water over
and let stand 15-20 seconds. Repeat as above.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat.
Add onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic
and half the prosciutto and saute 2 minutes. Remove garlic and
discard. Add rice and stir 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup wine and cook until
evaporated, stirring constantly, about
5    minutes.

Meanwhile, bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a saucepan. Reduce
heat to low. Cover and keep warm.

Add 1/2 cup stock to rice, reduce heat and simmer until liquid is
absorbed, stirring frequently. Continue adding remaining stock a half
cup at a time in the same manner, allowing each addition to be
completely absorbed before adding the next half cup. This should take
about 25 minutes. Stop adding stock if the rice begins looking really
mushy. It should be tender but still slightly firm to the bite.

Remove from heat. Mix in remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, then the
parmesan, lemon peel and remaining prosciutto. Garnish with paper-
thin slices of lemon and/or a few julienne slices of prosciutto, if
desired.

*When I make this, I use close to 1/4 lb. of prosciutto because I
*love* prosciutto and I also like to have a little left over for
garnish as above.
