In a preheated, 450-degree oven, place a whole large head of garlic
directly on the rack and dry roast for 40 minutes. Remove garlic head
and allow to cool for 1 hour. Turning garlic head on its side, slice

cloves and turn out on a cutting board; chop into a paste. Reserve.

Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a large saute pan. Add mushrooms. Cook 5
minutes on medium low heat. Add onion, corn, jalapeno, and roasted
peppers. Cook slowly for 10 minutes.

In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs; add egg white. Beat thoroughly. Add
buttermilk,  3/4 cup of the grated cheese, heavy cream, garlic paste,
cilantro, and seasonings. Add cooked vegetable mixture. Mix well.

To assemble: With remaining butter, thoroughly grease bottom and
sides of an ovenproof oval or rectangular baking pan
(9-inch-by-1-inch). Line bottom of pan with 3 corn tortillas all the
way to the edges. Place half of the corn-mushroom mix over tortillas.
Repeat layers. Top mixture with remaining grated cheese.

Bake in a 350-degree oven for 35 minutes or until thoroughly set.
Remove and allow to cool 15 minutes before unmolding to slice, or
serve directly out of baking dish.

Servings: 6 to 8 as a side dish.
