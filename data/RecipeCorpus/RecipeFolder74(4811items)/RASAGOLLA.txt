Title: RASAGOLLA
Categories: Desserts, Vegetarian, Indian, Cheese
Yield: 80 Rasagollas
1 ga Milk
1 c  Lemon juice
1 c  Sugar
Bring one gallon of milk to a boil.  When boiling add one cup of
either white vinegar or lemon juice.  Turn the stove off. Milk should
separate into whey and curd.

Pour into colander, leaving only the paneer/curd. Leave curd in
strainer until cold and dry.  This will take at least an hour (you
can leave it overnight).

Place curd in food processor and process for one minute. It should be
soft but not sticky.

Form small balls from the curd.  Using vinegar usually results in
about 80 to 100 rasagollas.

Bring one cup sugar and 3 cups water to a boil in a pressure cooker.
Place 20-25 rasagollas in syrup. Turn off the heat to place the cover
on the pressure cooker. Turn heat on high. When cooker begins to
whistle wait for a couple of minutes, then turn it off.

When pressure cooker depressurizes, remove cover and repeat previous
step with the rest of the rasagollas. Do not use the same sugar syrup
more than once.
