1    6" branch Rosemary; or
4 tb Dried Rosemary; crumbled
2 ts Black Peppercorns; cracked
Salt
1/8 ts Cayenne Pepper
3 lb Boneless Pork Loin; rolled

Mash garlic cloves by smashing them with the side of a French chef's
knife. Strip the rosemary needles from the stem and add them to the
garlic along with the cracked peppercorns, cayenne pepper and salt.
Rub this mixture over the outside of the meat.

Preheat the oven to 400øF. Spray a baking pan with nonstick cooking
spray. Place the loin in the prepared baking pan. Roast the pork in
the oven until it begins to brown, about 20 minutes. Then, add 1/2
cup water to the pan and turn the meat over, using tongs.

Meanwhile, toss the zucchini coins with salt and pepper to taste,
then with olive oil to coat. Add the zucchini to the bottom of the
roasting pan the last 30 minutes of roasting time. Roast the meat
about 1 1/2 hours total, or until it has reached an internal
temperature of 170øF., adding 1/4 cup water at a time every 20
minutes or so when the pan becomes dry.

Remove cooked meat to a board and let cool 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile,
remove any excess fat from the roasting pan. Add 1/4 cup wine to the
pan and boil , deglazing the pan, scraping up the bottom bits and
making a sauce. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper.

To serve, arrange zucchini in a bed on a warmed platter. Slice the
meat into 3/4" thick slices and fan these out over the zucchini.
Spoon the sauce over all and serve.
