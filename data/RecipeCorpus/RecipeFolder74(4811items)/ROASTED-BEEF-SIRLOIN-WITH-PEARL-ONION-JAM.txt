Title: ROASTED BEEF SIRLOIN WITH PEARL ONION JAM
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 8 Servings
3 lb Beef Top Sirloin Steak
-(boneless)
1 tb Olive oil
4    Garlic cloves; crushed
3 tb Black peppercorns
-- coarsely cracked
2 tb Rosemary
MMMMM----------------------PEARL ONION JAM---------------------------
1 pt Fresh pearl onions, peeled
1/4 c  Water
3 tb Sugar
1 tb Butter
1/2 c  Orange juice
Rub sirloin with olive oil and crushed garlic. Coat all sides with
pepper and rosemary. Roast sirloin in a 350 degree F oven on a rack
in a shallow roasting pan for 50-60 min. or 16-20 min. per pound.
Prepare onion jam 20 min. before roast is finished cooking. Heat
water, sugar and butter in a pan large enough to place onions in a
single layer, so they are just touching. Add onions; bring liquid to
a boil and reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking until onions begin
to caramelize; gently toss to glaze all sides.

When onions are a deep brown, add orange juice and stir to combine.
Remove from heat. Remove roast when meat thermometer inserted in
center reads 135 degree F for med-rare or 150 degree F for medium
doneness. Remove roast and let stand 10 min. before carving. Serve
sliced roast with Pearl Onion Jam.

Serving Suggestion: Stuffed Potato and Steamed Asparagus. Serves 8 to
10
