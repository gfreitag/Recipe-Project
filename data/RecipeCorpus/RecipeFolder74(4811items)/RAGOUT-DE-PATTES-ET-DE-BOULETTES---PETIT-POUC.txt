MMMMM----------------------RAGOUT DE PATTES---------------------------
4    Pork hocks, halved
1 lg Onion
1    Bay leaf
1/2 ts Dried savory
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1/4 ts Ground cloves
Cold water
2 tb Butter
2 tb Brown flour (see note)
MMMMM-------------------------BOULETTES------------------------------
2 lb Lean ground pork
1 lg Onion finely chopped
1    Clove garlic, minced
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground cloves
Salt & fresh ground pepper
2    Slices of bread crumbled
1    Egg, beaten
1/4 c  Oatmeal flour (up to 1/2 c)
How to make Brown Flour: Spread all-purpose flour in a large, heavy
frying pan and heat over medium heat, stirring, until flour turns a
medium brown. May be refrigerated for several months.

How to make Oatmeal Flour: Oatmeal flour may be made by pulverizing
roled oats in a food processor. All-purpose flour may be substituted.

Ragout de Pattes: Place pork hocks in a large heavy pot with onion,
bay leaf, savory, thyme and cloves. Cover with cold water, bring to a
boil, skim off any scum from surface, then reduce heat and simmer
very slowly for 2 - 2.5 hours or until pork hocks are tender. Remove
meat from bouillon and set aside. Strain bouillon and skim off fat.
(You may chill bouillon and then remove all solid fat before
continuing recipe.) Using the same large pot, melt butter and blend
in browned flour. Cook on medium heat, stirring, until mixture
bubbles all over, then add strained bouillon. Heat, stirring, until
mixture thickens. Season to taste with salt & pepper. Add pork hocks
and cooked meatballs and simmer gently for about 30 minutes. Season
to taste with salt & pepper.

Boulettes: Combine pork with onion, garlic, cinnamon, cloves, salt,
pepper, crumbled bread and the beaten egg, blending well. Blend in
just enough flour to make mixture firm. Shape into meatballs, about 1
~ 1.25 inch in diameter. Grease a large, heavy fryin pan and brown
meatballs well on all sides, continuing to cook on low heat for about
15 minutes. Makes 12 - 15 meatballs.
