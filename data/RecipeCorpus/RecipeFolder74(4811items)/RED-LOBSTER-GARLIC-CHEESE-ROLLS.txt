Title: RED LOBSTER GARLIC CHEESE ROLLS
Categories: Breads, Copycat
Yield: 1 Servings
16 oz Very finely shredded
-Cheddar cheese
6 c  Water
5 lb Box of Bisquick Mix
-Garlic butter,
-soft or melted
Mix together cheese, water and Bisquick in a large bowl. Drop onto a
non-stick cookie sheet or one that is covered with aluminum foil. You
will need to experiment with size but they should turn out to be
about the size of a normal biscuit (about 2" in diameter??). Bake at
400 degrees until golden (sorry, don't have the cooking time. Perhaps
the Bisquick box can help).  Right after you remove the rolls from
the oven, spread or brush VERY GENEROUSLY with garlic butter (soft or
melted butter with lots of finely diced or crushed garlic mixed in).
Serve rolls warm.

Note:  I have no idea how many rolls this makes so you may want to
cut it down unless you plan on feeding a herd!
