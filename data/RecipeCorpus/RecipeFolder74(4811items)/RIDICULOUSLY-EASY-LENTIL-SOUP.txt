Title: RIDICULOUSLY EASY LENTIL SOUP
Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Lentils (regular, not red)
7 c  Water
1 md Yellow onion, chopped
3    To 5 cloves garlic, minced
Or pressed
1 tb Olive oil
1 ts Salt
x  Freshly ground black pepper
x  Juice of one lemon
Bring the lentils and water to a boil in a large soup pot, then
reduce heat and simmer.  When the lentils have cooked for about 40
minutes, saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil until the onion
is soft, then add the mixture to the lentils, along with the salt and
plenty of black pepper. Simmer for another 30 minutes or so. Just
before serving, add about half the lemon juice, then taste to see
whether you want to add the rest. Add more salt and/or pepper if you
like.

This is a very simple and soothing soup.
