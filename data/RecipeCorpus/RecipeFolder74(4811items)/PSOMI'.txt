As you can see by previous Greek bread recipes, the Greek Housewives
made plenty of bread. These recipes are directly from Greece and are
in fairly large quantity.However this and other bread recipes can
easily be halved for the smaller hosehold. All yeast breads freeze
well too.

Crumble yeast in the warm water and let dissolve. Beat the margarine
until light and mix into the flour and yeast mixture. Then stir in
the oil, sugar, salt, cinnamon, eggs if using ( a lighter baked good
) and the milk, adding " more if needed"  to produce a kneadable
nonsticky dough. Knead smooth and elastic. Cover in a large bowl and
let rise double. Punch down and let rise double again. Shape into 5
loaves and place in pans. Beat egg and milk together and brush
loaves. Slash top of each bread. Bake 400 for 15 minutes and then 375
for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden and done. Recipe can be halved
easily.
