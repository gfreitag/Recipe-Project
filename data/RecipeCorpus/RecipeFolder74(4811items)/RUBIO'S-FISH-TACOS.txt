*DIRECTIONS  +++*

Mix flour with favorite spices such as garlic powder, red or black
ground pepper.  Stir the flour mixture into the beer and mix until
well blended. Wash fish by dipping in cold, lightly salted water or
water with a little bit of lemon juice added.  Be sure fish is
completely dry before dipping into batter.

Prepare salsa; reserve.

Put the vegetable oil into a deep skillet and bring to 375F. Place
fish in a single layer--do not let pieces touch each other. Cook fish
until batter is crispy and golden brown.

Heat corn tortillas lightly in a skillet or Mexican comal until they
are soft and hot.

To assemble, on each tortilla layer the fish fillet, white sauce,
salsa and cabbage.  Top it off with a squeeze of lime. Fold tortilla
over to serve.
