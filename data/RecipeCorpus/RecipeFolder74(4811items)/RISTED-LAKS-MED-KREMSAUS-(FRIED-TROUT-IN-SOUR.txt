Categories: Norwegian, Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Trout; fresh or frozen,
-about 1/2 lb ea, cleaned
-but with head & tail left
Salt
1/2 c  Flour
4 tb Butter
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 c  Sour cream
1/2 ts Lemon juice
1 tb Parsley; fresh chopped
If you are using frozen trout, defrost them completely before
cooking. Wash fish under cold running water, pat dry inside and out
and sprinkle a little salt into the cavities. Spread the 1/2 cup
flour over wax paper, roll the fish around in the flour and shake off
any excess. In a heavy 10-12" skillet, heat 2 tb butter and 2 tb oil.
When foam subsides, lower heat to moderate and fry the trout, 2 at a
time, for about 5 minutes on each side, turning them carefully with a
large spatula. When all the trout have been browned, keep them warm
on a heatproof platter in a 200Ã¸F. oven while you quickly make the
sauce. Pour off all the fat from the skillet and replace it with 2
tablespoons fresh butter. Stir over low heat, scraping up the brown
pan drippings with a wooden spoon. Add the sour cream and continue
stirring for about 3 minutes without letting the cream boil. Stir in
the lemon juice and pour the sauce over the hot fish. Garnish with
chopped parsley and serve at once.
