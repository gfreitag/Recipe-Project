Title: ROAST LEMON CHICKEN (FOR 4) *** NFWF89A
Categories: Chicken, Main dish
Yield: 8 Servings
3 lb Chicken
2 ea Lemons
1 ea Small garlic bulb; seperated
1 x  Salt and pepper
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Butter or margerine
1 x  Chopped fresh parsley
Cut up one lemon into 8 pieces. Rub the outside of a well cleaned and
dry chicken with the peel side of the pieces and then put the lemon
inside the chicken. Place the garlic in with the lemon. Season well
with salt and pepper and pour a mixture of half olive oil (only use
extra virgin if you can still find one around) and half butter on top
and inside of the chicken. (This has to be slightly heated first.
But, then I know I should not have to tell you all that) Roast for 1
1/2 hour in a preheated 325*F oven. Half an hour before taking the
chicken out of the oven, pour freshly squeezed lemon juice from the
second lemon over the top and sprinkle lightly with the fresh chopped
parsley. That is it. So simple. We all love it so much and I hope you
all do as well. Even our French roommate likes it, but then he can't
cook either.  DANA
