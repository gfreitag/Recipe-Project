1/2 c  chopped onions
1/4 c  chopped bell peppers
2 TB minced garlic
1 1/2 c  water

In a saute pan, brown the pork for about 3-4 minutes. Remove from the
pan and drain on a paper-lined plate. In a large saute pan, melt the
butter. Add 3 tablespoons of flour, stirring constantly for a brown
roux. Add the onions, peppers and garlic and continue to saute for
3-4 minutes, or until the vegetables wilt. Add the pork and saut_ for
3 minutes. Stir in the water. Season the mixture with salt and
pepper. Bring the liquid up to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook
the mixture for 45 minutes. Stir in the rice and green onions,
Tabasco, and 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs.

Remove from the heat and cool for 20 minutes. Season the flour and
remaining bread crumbs with Essence, separately. In a small mixing
bowl, whisk the egg and milk together. Season the mixture with
Essence. Shape the pork/rice mixture into balls the size of walnuts.
Dredge the balls in the flour. Dip each ball in the egg wash, letting
any excess drip off. Dredge the balls in the bread crumbs. Fry the
roulettes a couple at a time until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.
Remove the boulettes from the fryer and drain on a paper-lined plate.
Season with Essence. Spoon the Aioli in the center of the plate and
around the rim. Mound the boulettes in the center of the sauce.
Garnish with the grated cheese, parsley and peppers.
