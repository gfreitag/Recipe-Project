Thoroughly combine seasoning mix ingredients.  Place all ingredients
except roast in a large skillet. Saute about 4 minutes over high heat,
stirring occasionally. Cool. Meanwhile, place the roast in a baking
pan, fat side up.  Make several deep slits in the meat with a knife,
to form pockets, being careful not to cut through to the bottom.
Stuff the pockets with some of the vegetable mixture, then thoroughly
rub vegetable mixture over the entire roast by hand. If any of the
mixture is left, spread it evenly over the top and on sides of the
roast. Bake uncovered at 275 degrees for 3 hours, then at 425 degrees
until dark brown on top and meat is white in the Meal-Maste center,
10-15 minutes more.
