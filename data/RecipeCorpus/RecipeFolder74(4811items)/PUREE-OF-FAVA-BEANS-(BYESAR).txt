Title: PUREE OF FAVA BEANS (BYESAR)
Categories: Dips, Moroccan, Spreads, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Recipe
1/2 lb Dried fava beans
3 ea Garlic cloves
1 ts Cumin seeds
Olive oil
Water
Salt, to taste
1/4 ts Za'atar or thyme or
Marjoram or oregano
The night before, soak fava beans in 3 to 4 times their volume of cold
water.  Discard any favas that float. The following day, drain, skin
and cover with fresh water. Cook gently, with the garlic and cumin
seeds, until the beans are tender (about 2 hours, depending upon the
age and quality of the beans). Drain. Puree the beans in a food mill
or an electric blender. Stir in enough olive oil, and a little water,
to give the puree a soupy consistency. Sprinkle with salt to taste
and beat well. Heat just before serving with a little more olive oil
and a sprinkling of crushed za'atar. Serve with Arab bread and a bowl
of "mixed spices" (ground cumin, cayenne and salt). Yield: 4 to 6
servings.
