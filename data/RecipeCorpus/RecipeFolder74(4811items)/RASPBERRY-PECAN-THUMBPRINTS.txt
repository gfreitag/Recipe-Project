Yield: 36 Servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Pecan pieces, finely
Chopped, divided
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground allspice
1/8 ts Salt
1 c  Butter, softened
1/2 c  Packed lt. brown sugar
2 ts Vanilla extract
1/3 c  Seedless raspberry jam
PREHEAT oven to 350 F. Combine flour, 1/2 cup pecans, cinnamon,
allspice and salt in medium bowl.

BEAT butter in large bowl with electric mixer at medium speed until
smooth. Gradually beat in sugar; increase speed to high and beat
until light and fluffy. Beat in vanilla until blended. Beat in flour
mixture at low speed just until blended.

FORM dough into 1-inch balls; flatten slightly and place on ungreased
cookie sheets. Press down with thumb in center of each ball to form
indentation. Pinch together any cracks in dough.

FILL each indentation with scant 1/2 teaspoon jam. Sprinkle filled
cookies with remaining 1/2 cup pecans.

BAKE 14 minutes or until just set. Let cookies stand on cookie sheets
5 minutes; transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Store in
airtight container at room temperature. Cookies are best day after
baking.
