* Tomatoes should be medium-sized, firm, ripe, stemmed, peeled and
coarsely chopped. Chill the halibut or fresh tuna steaks briefly in
the freezer in order to firm the meat and make it easier to cut, but
do not let the fish freeze completely. With a cleaver or large, sharp
knife, cut the steaks lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices, then cut each
slice into pieces 1 1/2 inch square.
In a deep bowl, mix the lime juice, onions and salt together.
Drop in the fish and turn it about with a spoon until the strips are
evenly coated. Cover and marinate at room temperature for at least 2
hours, or in the refrigerator for 3 or 4 hours, stirring the fish
occasionally.
When done, the fish will be opaque and fairly firm, indicating
the it is fully "cooked". Taste to make sure; if it seems underdone,
marinate the fish for an hour or so longer.
To serve, drain the fish and squeeze it slightly to remove all the
excess moisture. Place the fish is a serving bowl, add the tomatoes,
scallions, green peppers and hard cooked eggs and cocoanut milk and
toss them all together gently but thoroughly. Note: The term poisson
cru means raw fish. The recipe itself is similar to the civiche
popular in many Latin American countries which "cooks" fish in a
marinade of lime or lemon juice seasoned with onions, garlic and hot
chilies. Source: Time-Life Books Foods of the World, Pacific and
