SAUCE: Saute carrots, onions, garlic & celery in oil for 5 minutes.
Add seasonings & saute another 5 minutes. Add sweetener, then add
tomato puree & simmer 1 to 2 hours. Should yield 7 c sauce. DOUGH:
Dissolve yeast in 1/2 c warm water with sweetener. Let stand till
yeast starts to foam. Mix flours together & combine yeast.  Add oil,
salt & rest of water. Knead to amke a medium stiff dough. Divide into
two pieces. Lightly oil 2 large rectangular pans & sprinkle with
cornmeal.  Roll out each piece of dough to an even rectangular shape.
Let dough rise (about 1 hour). Prebake doughs for 5 minutes at 350F
or till the gluten sets. Remove from oven. SPICE MIX: Mix spices
together till well blended. VEGETABLE TOPPING: Mix vegetables
together & saute them in the oil for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat
& transfer to a second pan if not using immediately. TO ASSEMBLE:
Spread about 1 1/2 c sauce on each crust. Add about 3 c of vegetable
topping & sprinkle 2 ts spice mixture over the top. If so desired,
spread 1 c shredded soy cheese over the top.  Bake at 375F for about
10 minutes, longer if cooking from cold.  (I found it needed about 20
minutes or longer, so keep an eye on it).
