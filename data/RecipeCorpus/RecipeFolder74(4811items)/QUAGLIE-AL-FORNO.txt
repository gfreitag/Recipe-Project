Title: QUAGLIE AL FORNO
Categories: Poultry, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
8    Quails, about 4 oz apiece
8 sl Blanched bacon
-(or Italian-style pancetta)
3 tb Butter
3    Fresh or dried sage leaves
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1/3 c  Dry white wine
PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Rinse quails and pat them dry with paper
towels. Lay a round of pancetta over breast and thighs of each bird
and tie securely with string. Melt butter in an oven-proof casserole
just large enough to hold quails. Add sage leaves and quails. Brown
them over medium heat 3-to-4 minutes on each side. Sprinkle with salt
and pepper, and pour on the wine. Set casserole in oven and bake
20-to-25 minutes, until tender, turning quails once after 10 minutes.
Remove strings and serve in a heated dish.
