Title: POTATO-VEGETABLE CHOWDER (VRG)
Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
Yield: 8 Servings
5 c  Vegetable broth (water is
Fine, but
Not as tasty)
1 c  Tomato or vegetable juice
1 c  Peeled tomatoes, cut in
sm Pieces
1 c  Carrots, chopped
1 c  Green beans or yellow wax
Beans
1 c  Onions, finely chopped
1 c  Zucchin or yellow squash,
Thinly sliced
1 c  Leek, chopped
2 c  Unpeeled red potatoes,
Diced
1    Cheesecloth bag of fresh
Erbs of choice
(parsley, basil, etc.)
2 ts Salt
Bring liquid to boil in a deep soup kettle. Add all vegetables and
seasonings. Turn down heat to simmer and partially cover the pot.
Simmer until vegetables are tender. Serve hot with crusty whole wheat
bread and a light fruit dessert.

Variation: Almost any vegetable but onions, tomatoes, and the
potatoes can be substituted for another vegetable. Don't use the
cabbage family because the flavor is too radically changed. Green
peas and baby lima beans are a great addition, as is 1/2 cup of corn
kernels.
