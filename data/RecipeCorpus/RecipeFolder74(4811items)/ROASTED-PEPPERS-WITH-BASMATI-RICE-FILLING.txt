1 1/2 c  Water
1 c  Basmati rice
3 tb Unsalted butter
1 md Onion -- finely chopped
2    Cloves garlic -- finely

Cut the stem ends off the peppers, reserving tops. Peppers can also be
sliced in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds and membranes. Set aside
while making filling.

In a saucepan, bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the
Basmati rice, cover the pan tightly, and reduce the heat to a simmer.
Simmer the rice for 25 minutes. Drain well.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.
Add the onion and saute for 5 minutes, until soft. Add the garlic and
saute for 1 minute more. Stir in, one ingredient at a time, the
capers, raisins, pistachios, and cilantro, sauteing each ingredient
for 1 minute. Add the cooked Basmati rice and remove the skillet from
the heat. Season with salt and pepper. Fill the prepared peppers with
the rice mixture.

Preheat the oven to 375#161#F. Arrange the peppers upright on baking
sheets. Replace the tops if desired and roast for 25 to 40 minutes,
depending on size.
