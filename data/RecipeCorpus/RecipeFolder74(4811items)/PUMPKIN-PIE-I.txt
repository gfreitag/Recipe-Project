Ogden writes:  "...  this recipe makes a light fluffy pie that shows
off the flavor of our Small Sugar pumpkins. " *This recipe should
work with other pumpkins, however.

Slice pumpkin in half and place halves face down on a pie sheet in a
350 F oven.  Bake 1 hour, or until knife penetrates skin easily.
Remove from oven, scoop out seeds and scrape pumpkin pulp from skin -
yield two cups. In a food processor, blend until smooth with the
remaining ingredients, using the steel blade. Pour into pie crust and
bake at 375 F for
40    minutes.
