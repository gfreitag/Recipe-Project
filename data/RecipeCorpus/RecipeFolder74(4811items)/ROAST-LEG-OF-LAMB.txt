Ingredients:

Leg of lamb (about 6 pounds) 8 cloves garlic juice of one lemon 1/2
tsp rosemary salt freshly ground black pepper Preheat oven to 325F.
Cut eight shallow slits in the surface of the lamb and insert a clove
of garlic in each slit.  Brush the lamb with lemon juice, sprinkle
with rosemary, salt and pepper.  Insert a meat thermometer into the
thickest part of the roast so the bulb reaches the center but does
not touch a bone. Place the lamb on a rack in a roasting pan and
roast for about 20 minutes per pound or until the thermomoeter
reaches 150F. Remove from oven, and let the leg stand uncovered for
10 to 15 minutes before carving.
