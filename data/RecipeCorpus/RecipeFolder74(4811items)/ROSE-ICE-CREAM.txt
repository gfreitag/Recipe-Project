Title: ROSE ICE CREAM
Categories: Ice cream
Yield: 1 Batch
1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
1 1/2 c  Milk
2/3 c  Sugar
3    Egg yolks
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 tb Rose-scented geranium
-leaves; chopped
1 1/2 c  Rose petals*
1 ts Rose water or up to 3
2 tb Pink rose petals**
*Loosely packed; white bases removed

** white bases removed; chopped

In a heavy 2-quart saucepan or double boiler over medium-low heat,
stir and heat the cream, milk, and sugar until the sugar dissolves.
Do not boil.

In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks lightly. While whisking, pour 1
cup of the hot cream mixture into the bowl, then pour the egg mixture
back into the saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Stir
constantly with a wooden spoon (don't let the mixture boil; it could
curdle) for about 8 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and coats
the spoon. To test for doneness, dip a metal spoon into the mixture
and run your finger across the back. The custard is done when your
finger leaves a clear, clean trail. A candy thermometer should read
175-180 degrees F. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
vanilla.

Stir the chopped rose-scented geranium leaves and the 1 1/2 cups of
rose petals into the hot prepared ice-cream base. Cover and chill in
the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (the longer it is refrigerated,
the stronger the flavor will be). Strain the mixture and add rose
water to taste, if desired. Stir in the chopped rose petals. Pour the
mixture into an ice-cream maker and freeze according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
