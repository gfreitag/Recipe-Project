Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 6 Servings
4 oz Plain chocolate
1 tb Instant coffee
4 tb Milk
4 oz Butter; softened
4 oz Soft light brown sugar
3 ea Eggs; separated
3 oz Cocoa powder
1 ea Strawberries; to decorate
2 oz Granulated sugar
4 tb Brandy
6 oz Strawberries; hulled
Preheat oven to 180 C. Lightly grease a 2 pt. loaf tin and line with
baking parchment. Break the chocolate into a heat-proof bowl, add the
coffee and milk, then stand it over a pan of hot water and stir until
cocolate melts. Leave to cool slightly. Cream the butter and sugar
together until pale and fluffy. Stir in the egg yolks, flour, cocoa
and chocolate until combined. Whisk egg whites until stiff, then beat
half into the mixture. Lightly fold in the other half and pour into
tin. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until firm to touch.

Meanwhile make the syrup: heat the sugar with 1/4 pint (150 ml) cold
water, stirring until dissolved, then boil rapidly for 3 min. Stir in
brandy and cool.

Next make the sauce: mash the strawberries, then sieve to remove the
pips. Chill.

Cover the cake with a damp tea-towel and cool for 15 min. Remove the
towel, prick the cake all over with a skewer, and pour on syrup. When
cold, remove cake from the tin, peel off paper, and put on to a
plate. Cut into slices, arrange each on a plate, then spoon on the
sauce. Decorate and serve with cream.
