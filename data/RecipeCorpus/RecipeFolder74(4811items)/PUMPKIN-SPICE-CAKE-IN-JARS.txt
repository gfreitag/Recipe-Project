Title: PUMPKIN SPICE CAKE IN JARS
Categories: Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Seedless raisins
1 c  Walnuts
2 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Ground cloves
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Ground ginger
4 lg Eggs
2 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Salad oil
- (use fresh oil only)
16 oz Cn pumpkin (not pie filling)
Preheat oven to 325-degrees.

Sterilize 8 Ball Quilted Crystal (#14400-81400) jam/jelly canning
jars, lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes. Remove the jars
and allow them to air-dry on your countertop; leave the lids and
rings in the water until you're ready to use them. Once the jars are
cool enough to handle, grease the insides with shortening (DO NOT use
butter, margarine, PAM or Baker's Secret).

Coarsely chop the raisins and walnuts; set aside. I used my mini
chopper and did them in batches.

Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cloves,
cinnamon and ginger in a lg bowl. Add raisins and walnuts; toss to
lightly combine; set aside.

In another large bowl, beat eggs at high speed until thick and
yellow (2-3 minutes). Gradually beat in the sugar until thick and
light. At low speed, beat in the oil and pumpkin; blend well.
Gradually stir in the flour mixture until well blended. Divide batter
among the 8 canning jars (should be slightly less than 1/2 full).
Wipe the sides of the jar off in case you slop or it'll burn (mine
did -- didn't wipe them down). Place jars on a cookie sheet or
they'll tip over.

Bake in preheated 325-degree oven for about 40 minutes or until
toothpick inserted into center of cakes (deep) and comes out clean.
Move the jars around in the oven while they're baking so they bake
evenly.

When cakes test done, remove them one-by-one (use HEAVY DUTY mitts);
place a HOT lid, then a ring on and screw down tightly. Place jars
onto your countertop to cool completely.
