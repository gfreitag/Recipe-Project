Categories: Thailand, Condiments, Thai
Yield: 6 Servings
1 ts Whole White Or Black
Peppercorns
2 tb Coarsely Chopped Fresh
Cilantro Roots Or Leaves
And Stems
2 tb Coarsely Chopped Garlic
CILANTRO PESTO:  Using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, crush
or grind the peppercorns to a fine powder. Combine the pepper,
cilantro roots and garlic; work the three ingredients into a fairly
smooth paste in the mortar or in a small blender or food processor.
If you use a blender or food processor, you may need to add a little
vegetable oil or water to ease the grinding. Make about 1/4 cup. For
an industrial strength batch use 1 tb peppercorns, 1/2 cup cilantro
roots and 1/2 cup garlic. To store the pesto for later use, put in a
glass jar, pour a little oil onto the surface to cover it and seal
tightly. It will keep nicely for about 1 week in the refrigerator.
