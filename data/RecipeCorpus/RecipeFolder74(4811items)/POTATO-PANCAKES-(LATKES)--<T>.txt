I've had very good results with the plastic bags of frozen Simply
Potato, a shredded potato that is the only one I could find without
added oil. More costly than shredding your own potato, it saves time
and also makes excellent hash browns (add onions, fry in non-stick
pan, no oil).

Putting a little rolled oats into a blender or coffee mill makes oat
flour in a jiffy. No need to go out and buy and store oat flour.
