Title: REDUCED-SUGAR BLACKBERRY & CRABAPPLE JAM
Categories: Jams, Fruits, Spread, Desserts
Yield: 750 Ml
500 g  Blackberries
300 g  Crabapples
200 ml Water
350 g  Sugar
2 tb Lemon juice
NOTES: 1) The set of this spread is softer than conventional jam
as it has less sugar.
:

2) Also, it MUST be kept in the fridge - will keep for 1
month. Will freeze also, but thawed jam must be used
within 2 weeks.

3) Try reducing the sugar further from 350g to 300g. Sterilize
some jars - wash in hot soapy water and rinse well. Shake out as much
water as you can, then dry in a 160 C (325 F, Gas 3) oven for at least
10    minutes.

Put a saucer in the fridge to chill.

EITHER grate the crabapples, discarding the cores, OR cut out the
cores and chop the apples finely in a processor. Put the berries,
apples and water in a saucepan. Bring to the boil then simmer 5
minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the sugar and lemon juice. Stir
until sugar is dissolved then increase heat and boil rapidly for 7
minutes. Remove from heat and test for set: put a teaspoonful onto
the chilled saucer and chill again for at least 2 minutes until cold.
This is what the jam will be like when it has cooled. If it is too
runny, clean off the saucer (so you don't get mixed up!), put it back
into the fridge and boil the jam for another minute or so. Test
again.  When happy with set, ladle into hot sterilized jars and put
on lids.
