Title: RICH EGG BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
2 pk Active dry yeast
1/2 c  Warm water (105ø-115øF)
1 1/2 c  Milk, lukewarm
-(scalded then cooled)
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Salt
3    Eggs
1/4 c  Shortening, softened
7 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl.  Stir in milk, sugar,
salt, eggs, shortening and 3 1/2 cups of the flour. Beat until
smooth. Mix in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.
Turn onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic,
about 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl; turn greased side up. Cover;
let rise in warm place until double, 1 to 1
1/2    hours.

Grease 2 loaf pans, 9x593 inches.  Punch dough down; divide into
halves. Roll each into rectangle 18x9 inches. Roll up, beginning at
9-inch side; press ends to seal. Fold ends under. Place seam side
down in pan. Cover; let rise until double, 1 hour.  Place oven rack
in lowest position.
Heat oven to 425øF.  Bake until loaves sound hollow when tapped, 25
to 30 minutes.

Recipe from Gold Medal package.  One of the best I have ever used.
And if I am mad at somebody, it helps relieve frustions which a bread
machine would not.
