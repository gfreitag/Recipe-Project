Title: QUICK CHICK'N DUMPLINGS
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 1/2 lb Assorted Chicken Pieces
1/2 c  Chopped onion
2    Thin lemon slices
1    Bay leaf, small
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
2 1/2 c  Water
MMMMM-------------------------DUMPLINGS------------------------------
1 c  Sifted flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Chopped onion
1/8 ts Nutmeg
2    Egg yolks, beaten
1/2 c  Half-and-half cream
In a kettle with a tight fitting lid, place the chicken, onion,
lemon, bay leaf, salt, pepper and water. Bring to rolling boil and
skim away any froth that gathers. Cover tightly and simmer for 30
minutes, or until a chicken breast can be pierced with a fork. Turn
pieces of chicken over once or twice during this cooking period.

Dumplings: Mix well the flour, baking powder, salt, chopped onion and
nutmeg. Alternately add the beaten eggs and cream to the flour
mixture, stirring after each addition. Mix until all is smoothly
blended. Drop teaspoonsful of the mixture on top of the bubbling
chicken mixture. Close cover tightly again and simmer for another 15
minutes without opening cover. When ready to serve, break dumplings
apart with a fork, arrange on a platter with the chicken, and pour
the remaining gravy over all. Submitted By PGL@IGLOU.COM (DON THOMAS)
