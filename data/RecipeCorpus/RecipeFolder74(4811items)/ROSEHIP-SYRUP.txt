Title: ROSEHIP SYRUP
Categories: Misc, Beverages, British
Yield: 600 Mls
2 lb Ripe rosehips; washed
1 lb Sugar
60 fl Boiling water
30 fl Boiling water
Bring the water to the boil in a large, preferably stainless steel or
unchopped enamelled saucepan. Press the rosehips through the coarse
blade of a mincer and place immediately in the first (larger) batch
of boiling water. Bring the mixture to the boil again . As soon as
the mixture boils, remove the pan from the heat and leave 15 minutes.
Pour the rosehips into a scalded jelly bag and allow the bulk of the
juice to drip through. Return the pulp in the jelly bag to the
saucepan, add the second quantity of boiling water, re-boil, then
allow to stand without further heating for another 10 minutes.
Pour the juice into a clean saucepan and simmer to reduce to the
volume of the second quantity of water. Add sugar in the proportion
of 1 lb for each 30 fl of juice. Stir till dissolved, then boil for a
further 5 minutes.
Pour the hot syrup into hot bottles and seal at once. Sterilise for
5 minutes. If using corks only, seal with melted paraffin or sealing
wax.
NB. It is advisable to use small bottles as the syrup will not keep
for more than a week or two once opened.
