Title: RIPE BANANA LOAF:)
Categories: Ron's, Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 1 Loaf
250 g  Self raising flour
1 ts Level mixed spice
1/2 ts Salt
125 g  Caster sugar
125 g  Butter
1 tb Honey
125 g  Sultanas
100 g  Glace cherries
100 g  Blanched almonds, chopped
Or walnuts
500 g  Very ripe bananas
2    Eggs
Juice of 1 lemon
Sift flour, spice, salt, and caster sugar, into a bowl. Chop butter
into small pieces and add that, and then all remaining ingredients -
remember to peel the bananas first and mash them with a fork. Mix
thoroughly. Turn the mixture into a 22cm [9"] loaf tin. Bake at 180c
for one hour, then for another 1/2 hour at 160c. Remove from the tin
and cool on a rack. Serve thinly sliced and buttered - like most tea
loaves, it tastes all the better for keeping. From Ron's (and
Lillian's) Plaice in Blackpool:)
