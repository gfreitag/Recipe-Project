This recipe comes from Jean Charest's mother-in-law, Lisette Dionne.
"It must be Canadian lamb with lots of garlic, cooked rare, along
with potato casserole layered with Emmental cheese from the
St.-Benoit-du-Lac monastery in my region." Jean Charest is one of the
front runners of the Conservative leadership candidates, one of whom
will be our next prime minister.

Inset garlic slivers into lamb. Rub with oil, then herb mixture.
cover with foil and refrigerate 2-3 hours to allow flavours to
penetrate the meat. Roast in a preheated 400F oven 30-45 minutes
depending on weight.

Serve with Gratin Dauphinois and Tomato Provencale: (Tomatoes halved,
sprinkled with the same herbs but minus rosemary and bay leaf. Bake
in 400F oven 10 minutes or till tender.
