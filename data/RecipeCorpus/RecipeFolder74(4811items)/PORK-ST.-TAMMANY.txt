Cook rice according to package directions.  Set aside. Pour boiling
water over apricots; let stand 20 minutes to soften. Drain. Saute
green onions, mushrooms, and green pepper in butter until tender.
Stir in rice, apricots, pecans, parsley, and seasonings. Remove
strings and slice roast in half lengthwise, if not purchased sliced.
Slice pork pieces lengthwise in half again, slicing to but not
through one side. Lay pieces side by side, and spoon stuffing mixture
evenly over pork. Beginning with 1 long side, roll pork jellyroll
fashion, and tie securely with heavy string at 2 inch intervals.
Place roast on a lightly greased rack in a shallow roasting pan.
Place bacon lengthwise over roast.  Insert meat thermometer into
thickest part of roast, making sure it does not touch fat or
stuffing. Place an aluminum foil tent over roast. Bake at 325F for 3
hours or until meat thermometer registers 160F (30-35 minutes per
pound). Remove foil for the last 30-40 minutes of baking. Remove
roast from oven; let stand 5 minutes.
Remove string; slice and garnish with apricot halves and parsley, if
desired. Yield: 12 to 15 servings. From Southern Living Cookbook
