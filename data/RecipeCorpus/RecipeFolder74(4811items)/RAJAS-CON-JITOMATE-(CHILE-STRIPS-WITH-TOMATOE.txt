Remove the seeds and veins from the chiles and cut them into strips
about 1 1/2 inhes long and 1/2 inch wide. If the chiles seem too
picante, soak them in salted water for about 30 minutes.

Heat the oil and fry the onions gently, without browning them, until
they are soft.

Add the chile strips, tomatoes and salt to the onions in the pan. Cook
uncovered, over a fairly high flame until the vegetables are well
seasoned and the liquid has evaporated--about 10 minutes.

This is excellent served like a thick sauce over Torta de Elote. It
also makes a very good accompaniment to plain broiled meat, fish, or
chicken.
