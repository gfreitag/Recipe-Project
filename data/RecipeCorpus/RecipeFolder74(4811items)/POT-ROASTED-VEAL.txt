Title: POT-ROASTED VEAL
Categories: Meats
Yield: 8 Servings
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 tb Chopped shallots
1/2 ts Ground rosemary
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
5 lb Veal round roast
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1/2 c  White wine
2 tb Unsalted butter
MIX 3 TABLESPOONS OIL, shallots, half the rosemary, salt and pepper
together and rub all the surfaces of the veal. Cover and refrigerate
for at least 4 hours, or overnight. Heat remaining oil in a Dutch
oven or covered casserole over medium-high heat on top of the stove.
Add the veal and sear on all sides until browned, about 15 minutes.
Use a pair of large spoons or tongs to turn the meat so you don't
pierce it. Drain excess fat. Add the lemon juice, wine and remaining
rosemary. Cover and reduce heat to low. Cook for 2 hours, or until
tender. Check periodically and, if the casserole is dry, add a
tablespoon or two of water. Remove the pot from the heat, uncover and
transfer the roast to a carving board. Let the roast rest for 15
minutes before slicing. Swirl butter into the cooking juices in the
casserole. To serve, cut the roast into 1/4-inch slices and arrange
on a serving platter. Strain the sauce over the meat and serve
immediately.
