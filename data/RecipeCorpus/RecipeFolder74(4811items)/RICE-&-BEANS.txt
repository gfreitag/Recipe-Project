Title: RICE & BEANS
Categories: Loo, Chinese, Beans, Desserts
Yield: 4 Or provide
3/4 c  Mung beans
Water
1/4 c  Rice
Water
6 tb Sugar
Water
Soak beans in water for 5 hours. Get rid of green skins, if any, that
float to the surface; you might encourage then to come off by rubbing
the beans between your hands; drain. Rinse rice three times in water;
drain. Put rice and beans in a pot. Add 4 c water and bring to a boil
for 1 minute; then lower the heat, and let simmer for 1 hr. Add sugar
to taste (the 6 T called for might not be enough for Western tastes).
Stir, ladle into soup bowls, and serve warm.
