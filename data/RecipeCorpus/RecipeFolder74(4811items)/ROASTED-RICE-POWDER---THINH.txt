Title: ROASTED RICE POWDER - THINH
Categories: Ethnic, Rice
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Raw glutinous rice
Roasted rice powder is used as a flavoring and binding agent in
various recipes throughout this book. It is necessary to soak the
rice first in order to obtain a deep golden color after roasting.
Soaking also makes the rice easier to grind.

Soak the glutinous rice in warm water for 1 hour. Drain.

Place the rice in a small skillet over moderate heat. Toast the rice,
stirring constantly with chopsticks or a wooden spoon, until deep
golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Transfer the roasted rice to a spice grinder or blender and process
to a fine powder (the powder should resemble saw dust). Sift the
ground rice through a very fine sieve into a bowl. Discard the grainy
bits. Store the rice powder in a tightly covered jar in your
refrigerator and use as needed. It will keep for up to 3 months.

Yield: 1 cup.
