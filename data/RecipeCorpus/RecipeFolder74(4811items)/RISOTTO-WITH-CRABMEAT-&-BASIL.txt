saute 1 minute. Add 1 cup chicken stock to rice, reduce heat and
simmer until liquid is absorbed, stirring frequently. Continue adding
enough of remaining chicken stock 1 cup at a time until rice is just
tender but still firm to bite, stirring frequently and allowing each
addition to be absorbed before adding next, about 20 minutes. Add
whipping cream and simmer 2 minutes. Mix i n goat cheese, then
crabmeat and chopped basil. Season risotto to taste with salt and
pepper. Serves 6. From the files of Al Rice, North Pole Alaska. Feb
