Title: RISOTTO CON LA ZUCCA
Categories: Pasta/rice, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
Rice (Vialone)
200 g  Milanese pumpkin; cleaned
100 g  Butter
Parmesan
1/2    Onion
1    Stock cube
Salt
Time required: 30 min ca.

1) Boil 1 litre water. 2) Fry the chopped onion in half the butter.
3) Pour in the rice and the cubed pumpkin; roast slightly then pour
in the boiling water a bit at a time. 4) Half-way through the
cooking, add the crumbled stock cube. 5) Add cheese and butter before
serving.

Notes: This recipe needs dry pumpkin (milanese pumpkin in Italian): I
don't know what it's called in English, but it has a dark knobbly
skin and a dark orange dry, firm flesh. Neapolitan pumpkin is too
watery.
