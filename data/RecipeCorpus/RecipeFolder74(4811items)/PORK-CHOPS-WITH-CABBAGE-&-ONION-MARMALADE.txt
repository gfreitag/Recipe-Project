1.  To make marmalade, warm oil in large heavy pot over medium heat.
Add onions and cook, stirring, until they begin to carmelize, about
15 minutes. Add oregano, salt and pepper to taste, and sugar and cook
gently for 10 minutes.

2.  Add stock and vinegar and cook over high heat until most of the
liquid evaporates, about 4-5 minutes. Add jelly and stir until
melted. Taste and adjust with lemon juice if necessary.  Spoon into a
heatproof bowl and cover to keep warm.

3.  To cook pork, warm oil in heavy pot over medium heat. Add chops
in a single layer and saute, turning once, until golden on each side.
Add orange zest and juice and wine, cover tightly, and cook gently
until fork tender, about 12-15 minutes. Transfer pork chops to
platter and keep warm.

4.  Add cabbage to same pan and cook over high heat, stirring for 3
minutes. Partially cover and cook until cabbage is just tender, about
4-5 minutes. Season with cumin seeds and salt and pepper to taste.

5.  To serve, divide marmalade among four warmed dinner plates. Place
cabbage on top and lean chops against vegetables. Spoon pan juices
over top and serve at once.
