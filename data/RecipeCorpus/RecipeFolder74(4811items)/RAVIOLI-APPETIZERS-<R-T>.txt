These tasty bites of pasta are perfect for back porch picnics, where
the kitchen is close at hand.  Simply prepare the ravioli ahead and
pop them into the oven for 5 min when your guests arrive.

Preheat the oven to 45 deg F.  Coat 2 baking sheets with nonstick
spray.

In a pie plate, combine the bread crumbs and oregano. Roll each hot
ravioli in the crumb mixture until coated. Place the ravioli, 1"
apart, on the baking sheets. Mist them with the nonstick spray.

Bake 1 sheet of the ravioli until lightly browned, about 5 min. Bake
the second sheet.  Serve with the spaghetti sauce for dipping.

Servings:  12

Quite good.

Reggie's Notes: 1. Use very fine bread crumbs 2. Not good reheated
