To prepare the mushrooms:  Remove stems from mushrooms. Set stems
aside for mushroom broth.  Wipe the mushrooms clean with a damp
cloth. Combine olive oil, shallot, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.
Toss mushroom caps in the mixture to coat well.  Grill or broil
mushrooms until tender, about 10 minutes.  Cut into nickel-size
chunks; set aside. (Mushrooms can be made ahead and refrigerated).

To prepare mushroom broth:  Mince reserved mushroom stems; set aside.
Saute garlic and shallot in the olive oil until translucent. Add
minced stems. Saute a few minutes more. Pour in red wine and increase
the heat, stirring until almost all the wine has evaporated. Add
stock. Lower the heat and simmer uncovered about 25 to 30 minutes or
until the liquid is reduced by one-fourth.  Set aside.  (Broth can be
made ahead and refrigerated. Reheat before using in risotto.)

To prepare risotto:  Cook the onion in the oil until soft but not
browned. Add the rice; stir until it is coated. Cook, stirring, until
a toasted aroma develops. Stir in salt and pepper. Add the reserved
mushroom stock in several additions, stirring the rice frequently and
letting most of the stock be absorbed before adding more. If you do
not have enough mushroom stock, finish making risotto with stock.
Cook until the rice is almost tender and most of the liquid is
absorbed. Stir in oil and reserved mushrooms.
