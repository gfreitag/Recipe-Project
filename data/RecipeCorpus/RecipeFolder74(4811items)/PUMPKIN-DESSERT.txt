Categories: Desserts, Box cakes, Holiday
Yield: 1 Cake
1 c  Sugar, granulated
3    Eggs, beaten
29 oz Pumpkin (1 large can)
2 ts Cinnamon, ground
1/2 ts Ginger, ground
1/4 ts Cloves, ground
1/2 ts Salt
12 oz Evaporated milk
-(1 large can)
1 lb Cake mix, yellow
-(1 standard box)
1 c  Nuts, chopped
4 tb Butter (sweet), melted
Whipped cream
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix together sugar, eggs, pumpkin,
cinnamon, ginger, cloves, salt and milk. Line a 9x13-inch pan with wax
paper and pour the mixture in.

Sprinkle the dry cake mix on top, then sprinkle the nuts. Pour melted
butter evenly over the cake mix and nuts. Bake at 350 degrees F. for
50-60 minutes.

Cool (very important).  Flip over and remove from pan. Remove the wax
paper. Top with whipped cream (which would dissolve if the cake
weren't cooled first).

copies of the recipe for people who tasted it.
