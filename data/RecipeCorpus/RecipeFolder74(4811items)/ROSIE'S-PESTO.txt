Title: ROSIE'S PESTO
Categories: Rosie's
Yield: 1 Cup
1 1/2 c  Basil leaves, fresh
2    Garlic cloves, peeled (may
-use up to 5 cloves)  *
1/4 c  Pine nuts
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese, fresh grate
1/4 c  Lemon juice, fresh squeezed
Put the basil, garlic, pine nuts, and parmesan cheese in a blender or
food processor. Turn the machine on and drizzle in the lemon juice.
Continue to puree until a smooth paste is formed. * The amount of
garlic you use is a matter of personal taste.  Also, some garlic is
more pungent. So start perhaps with 2 medium cloves, then taste, and
add more if, as I do, you like a strong, garlicky flavor. Makes 3/4
cup pesto
