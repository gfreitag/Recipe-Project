2    Eggs -- well beeaten
1/4 c  Cold water
4 lb Chicken -- cut up
Combine first 9 ingredients in large bowl. Put the cornflakes into

into a heavy roomy skillet to fill it 1" deep. Get it HOT! Grease a
9x12x2 baking pan. Set it aside. Preheat oven to 350~. Dip chicken
pieces 1 piece at a time as follows: 1-Into dry coating mix. 2-Into
egg and water mix. 3-Into corn flakes. 4-Briskly but briefly back
into dry mix. 5-Drop into hot oil, skin-side-down and brown 3 to 4
minutes on medium high. Turn and brown other side of each piece.
Don't crowd pieces during frying. Place in prepared pan in single
layer, skin-side-up. Seal in foil, on 3 sides only, leaving 1 side
loose fro steam to escape. Bake at 350~ for 35-40 minutes removing
foil then to test tenderness of chicken. Allow to bake uncovered 5
minutes longer to crisp the coating. Serves 4. Leftovers refrigerate
well up to 4 days. Do not freeze these leftovers. Leftover coating
mix (1st 9 ingredients) can be stored at room temp in covered
container up to 2 months. Source: Gloria Pitzer
