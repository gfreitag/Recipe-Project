"Quemada" literally means "burnt" -- and that is what is done to the
tomatoes and green onions, giving the salsa a smoky flavor and rich
color.

Place tomatoes and green onions on a hot mesquite grill (over hot
coals, not flames).  Pile the cilantro on top, so that it does not
touch the grill.  Grill the vegetables 10 to 15 minutes, or until the
peppers are soft. Place the vegetable oil in a saute pan over
medium-high heat. Add the serranos and saute until the peppers are
soft. Place the serranos, tomatoes, onion, and cilantro in a food
processor fitted with the metal blade.  Process until coarsely
ground. Remove tomato mixture to mixing bowl and stir until
ingredients are evenly distributed. In a separate bowl, mix garlic,
lime juice, salt, white pepper, oregano, and water until well-
blended.  Add garlic mixture to ground vegetables and mix thoroughly.
Makes about 3 cups.
