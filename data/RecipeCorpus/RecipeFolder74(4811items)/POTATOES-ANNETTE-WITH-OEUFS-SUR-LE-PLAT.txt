Title: POTATOES ANNETTE WITH OEUFS SUR LE PLAT
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 2 Servings
350 g  Potatoes; peeled
25 g  Butter
Eggs (1 or 2 per person)
Salt and pepper
A crispy cake of julienne potatoes cooked in butter makes a delicious
base for lightly cooked eggs. A perfect supper dish which costs next
to nothing, a memorable meal served with a soft lettuce salad and
some fresh bread.

Cut the potatoes into strips ('julienne'). Wash them in cold water
and dry thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a
heavy frying pan and saute the potatoes until they are well coated,
then press them down into a cake with the back of a fork. Brown on
one side only over a very low heat, covered with a lid, for 30
minutes. When well browned, loosen around the edges and carefully
invert on to a platter, and keep warm.

Put a little more butter into the pan and heat gently. Break one or
two eggs per person into the pan and cook through gently until they
set lightly, without browning the whites (oeufs sur le plat are a far
cry from a fried egg!). Serve on wedges of the potato cake.
