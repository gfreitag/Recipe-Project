Title: QUICK-FRIED BEEF WITH OYSTER SAUCE
Categories: Beef, Chinese
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Beef steak
1/2 ts Salt
3 1/2 tb Vegetable oil
1 tb Soy sauce
2 ts Cornstarch
2 tb Water
2 tb Sherry
4 tb Beef stock
2 sl Ginger root
2 1/2 tb Oyster sauce
3/4 ts Sugar
Pepper -- to taste
Cut the beef into small thin slices and rub these with the salt and
1/2 tablespoon of oil.  Mix the soy sauce, cornstarch, water, sherry
and stock in a bowl until well blended. Finely chop the ginger. Heat
the oil in a frying pan. When hot add the beef, spreading the pieces
out, and stir-fry them over a high heat for 1 minute. Add the ginger,
followed by the oyster sauce and sugar, and continue to stir-fry for
30 seconds. Pour in the sauce mixture from the bowl, and continue to
stir-fry over a high heat for a further minute.  Serve immediately on
a well-heated dish. This mixture of seafood flavor with meat is a
common Cantonese practice which most southerners enjoy, but hich is
not always accepted in central and north China.
