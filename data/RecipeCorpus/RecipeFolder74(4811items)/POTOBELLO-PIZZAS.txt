Title: POTOBELLO PIZZAS
Categories: Miamiherald, Ovolacto
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Fresh portobello mushrooms
-3-5 inches wide
3    Canned chipotie chilies in
-adobo sauce
3 tb Oyster sauce
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
1 lg Red onion; sliced
3    Poblano chilies or green
-bell peppers; sliced
Salt
4 oz Mexican chihuahua or other
-good melting cheese
Note: look for canned chipotle chilies and oyster sauce in the ethnic
section of your supermarket. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut stems
off portobellos and use for another purpose, such as duxelles. Clean
caps with a wet cloth.  Bake mushrooms about 3 minutes ~ longer if
you are going to eat them with a fork. Meanwhile puree chipotles and
oyster sauce in a blender until smooth; add a little water if
necessary. Set aside. Heat oil over medium heat in a large saute pan.
Saute onions and poblanos until mixture begins to wilt, then add salt
to taste. Mixture should be somewhat moist rather than dry because
onion and chilies can dry out in oven. Continue to saute 3 minutes,
then remove from heat and cool. Place portobellos with gill side up
in front of you. Brush top with chipotle-oyster sauce mixture. Top
with onion mixture. Place mushrooms on baking sheet and bake 5
minutes. Remove and spread cheese over tops. Return mushrooms to oven
and bake another minute or until all cheese is melted. Serve
immediately.
