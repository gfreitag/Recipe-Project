Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 lb Salt pork, fatty
10    Potatoes; finely grated
4    Potatoes; cooked & mashed

Soak the pork overnight in cold water to remove the salt, and cut into
cubes. Extract the water from the grated potatoes by putting them in a
cotton bag and squeezing vigorously. Mix the mashed potatoes with
grated potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Roll the potato mixture
into balls resembling small snowballs. Make a hole in the centre of
the potato ball and add 1 Tbsp of the salt pork. Close the hole and
roll the poultines in flour. Gently drop the poultines 2 or 3 at a
time, into a large pot of boiling salted water, ensuring that the
water is kept at a rolling boil. Simmer the poultines for 2-3 hours.
Eat the poultines hot with butter, salt and pepper, or as a dessert
with sugar and molasses. MAKES: 6 POULTINES
