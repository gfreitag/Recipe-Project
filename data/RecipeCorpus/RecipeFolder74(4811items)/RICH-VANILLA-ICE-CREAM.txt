Title: RICH VANILLA ICE CREAM
Categories: Desserts, Ice cream
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Heavy cream
1 c  Whole milk
3/4 c  Sugar
2 tb (yes, Tablespoons, not
-teaspoons!) Vanilla
5    Egg yolks
Heat cream, milk and sugar in heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar
dissolves. Add egg yolks by adding some mixture to eggs to dilute,
and then adding diluted eggs to rest of pan (adding straight will
cook them and make for lumpy cream). Whisk constantly over med heat
until mixture coats the back of a spoon (seems to take forever, about
10 min?). DO NOT LET BOIL (or it will curdle) Strain, if you want,
and add vanilla (I never strain, it comes out fine). Cool completely
in refrigerator. Freeze according to manufacturers instructions.
Makes about 1 quart. ( I double this if using the hand crank - it has
a much larger capacity, but doesn't seem to last any longer after its
made.... Hmmm....)
