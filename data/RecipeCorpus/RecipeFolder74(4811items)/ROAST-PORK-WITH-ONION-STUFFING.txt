Rub the roast with oil and spinkle evenly with salt, thyme and pepper.
Place into a 325 F. oven on a roasting rack and insert a meat probe
or meat thermometer into the thickest portion.  Roast until the meat
registers 170 F., about two hours. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a
frying pan. Add the onions, cook ten minutes or until onions are very
soft; mix in the flour, lemon juice, chicken stock base, salt,
nutmeg, pepper and water, blending well. Cook until thickened.

Cut the cooked roast almost all the way through into slices. Stuff
between the slices with filling.  Frost the top of the roast with the
remaining onion filling. Remove the drippings from the pan. Return
the roast to the oven.  Bake 30 minutes more more, until it is
lightly brown. Stir one cup of water into the pan drippings along
with the cornstarch. Cook, stirring, until the sauce is thickened.
Season to taste.
