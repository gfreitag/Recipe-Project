Title: POTATO SCONES (SCOTTISH)
Categories: Cakes, Appetizers
Yield: 12 Servings
1/2 lb Cooked Potatoes
2 oz Flour
1/2 oz Butter
Pinch Salt
A little Milk or Buttermilk
To bind
To test for the correct heat on the gridle sprinkle it with a
:
little flour. If the flour browns at once it is too hot; it should
take a few seconds to turn colour.
Grease a gridle or heavy frying-pan. Mash the patatoes with
:
the butter and a little milk. Mix with a spoon. Add the salt and a
little of the flour. Use the fingers until it is all taken up and the
dough is fairly stiff. Turn out on to a floured surface. Roll out to
1/4 inch thick and cut into rounds using a breakfast cup as a cutter.
Place on the hot greased gridle or frying-pan. Cook for 2 minutes
util the underside is brown. Turn and repeat on the other side. Serve
piping hot, spread with butter. :
