Categories: Ron's, Heirloom, Desserts, British, Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Thick slices of bread

1/2 ts Cinnamon

This dish originated during the middle ages in England and spread all
over the world with many variations. Traditionalists should use
bread, but stale cake is a good substitute. Red wine can be used
instead of white. Substitute milk for wine and you have a more
recognizable dish called, incorrectly, french toast.

Bread: Cut off crusts and cut into quarters. Place in a deep dish.
Mix eggs with wine, cinnamon, and sugar in a bowl. Pour, once mixed,
over the bread and leave to soak for 3 minutes. Heat the oil [1/4
inch deep]. Drain the bread and slide it into the hot oil {Watch your
hands as it 'spits'}. Fry until golden brown on both sides Drain on
absorbent kitchen paper. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar and ground
cinnamon. From Ron's Plaice in Blackpool:) Feb 1996.
