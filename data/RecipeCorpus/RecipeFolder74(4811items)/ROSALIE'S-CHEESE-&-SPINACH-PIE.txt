is soft and translucent. Add ham and spinach and saute briefly to
warm through. Remove from heat.

In mixing bowl, mix together ricotta cheese and vegetables. Add grated

Grease quiche pan with just enough olive oil to coat. Pour in mixture

knife inserted in center comes out clean.

NOTES:

*  A rich spinach pie with ham and cheese -- I ate this dish at Cafe
Le Rat in Middleburg, Virginia, and was delighted to find their
recipe in _Gourmet_ magazine in the late 1970s. I have modified the
recipe somewhat from the published version to make it less stringy
and sticky.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 45 minutes baking and cooling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
