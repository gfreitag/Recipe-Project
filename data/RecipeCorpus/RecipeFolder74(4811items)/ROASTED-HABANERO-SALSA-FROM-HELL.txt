Title: ROASTED HABANERO SALSA FROM HELL
Categories: Appetizers, Sauces, Dips
Yield: 2 Cups
1 tb Olive oil
1 ts Garlic, minced
6 ea Plum tomatoes, halved
Salt & pepper, to taste
10 ea Habanero chili peppers,
-- stemmed
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Lime juice
1/4 c  Cilantro, chopped
Protective gloves
Combine the Tablespoon of olive oil and garlic and mix well. Rub
tomato halves with this mixture, sprinkle with salt and freshly
cracked pepper and roast in a 500F oven until they begin to take on
some serious color, about 15 - 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and
let cool to room temperature and dice.  Meanwhile, grill the 10
habanero peppers over a medium-hot fire until slightly colored, 2 - 3
minutes.  Remove peppers from fire and mince. Be very careful when
working with this pepper. Wear gloves while mincing it, and if any
juice gets on your skin, wash it off with a mild bleach solution.
This neutralizes the capsaicin. Also, do not rub your eyes, and wash
you hands well after you are finished. In a medium bowl, combine
tomatoes, peppers, 1/4 cup olive oil, lime juice, and cilantro. Mix
well, and prepare for take-off! This salsa will keep, covered and
refrigerated, for 5 - 6 weeks, mainly because no mold or bacteria
would dare to come near the stuff!
