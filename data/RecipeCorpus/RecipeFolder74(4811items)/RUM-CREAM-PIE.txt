-rust pie
6 lg Egg yolks
1 c  Sugar
2 c  Heavy cream, well chilled
1/2 c  Dark rum
1 1/2 tb Unflavored gelatin

Line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry, cover with foil and fill with
rice. Bake the empty pie crust at 400f for 15 minutes. Remove rice
and foil and bake at 375f for 10 minutes more or until it is pale
golden. In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks.  Add
the sugar gradually, beating until the mixture is thickened and pale.
Beat in 1 cup of cream, rum, and 1/4 cup water.  Transfer the mixture
to the top of a double boiler. Cook, stirring constantly until it
registers 140f on a candy thermometer. Then cook for 3 minutes more.
In a small saucepan, sprinkle the gelatine over 1/4 cup cold water.
Let it soften for 5 minutes, and heat the mixture over low heat,
stirring, until the gelatin is dissolved. Whisk into the custard, set
the bowl in a larger bowl of ice water and let the mixture cool,
stirring it occasionally, until it is the consistency of raw egg
whites. Do not let the mixture set. In a bowl, beat the remaining
cream until it just holds stiff peaks. Fold the whipped cream into
the custard gently but thoroughly. Pour the mixture into the pie
shell. Chill for 3 hours or until set. Garnish with chocolate curls.
