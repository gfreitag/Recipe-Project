(Good and fast.  Many grocery stores now have a "chicken-roasting
machine": a couple of these small ready-roasted chickens, or one
biggish one, are what you're after.) Skin and bone the chicken,
cutting the meat into chunks.  Add the oil or ghee to your karahi,
heat, and quickly stirfry the garlic:  before it browns, add the
chopped onions and fry until translucent.  Add the chicken, then the
masala paste.

Stir-fry for 5 minutes or so. Add the chicken stock, stir, and cook
until reduced (usually 10 minutes or thereabouts). Add coriander
leaves and serve in Balti bowls.
