Keep popcorn warm in 200~ oven while preparing coating. In 2-quart
saucepan stir together sugar, corn syrup, water, butter and salt.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a
boil. Continue cooking without stirring until temperature reaches
270~ on a candy thermometer or until a small amount dropped into very
cold water separates into threads which are hard but not brittle.
Remove from heat. Add vanilla; stir just enough to mix through hot
syrup. Slowly pour over popcorn, stirring to coat every kernel. Cool
just enough to handle. With greased hands, shape into balls.

VARIATION: Use almond, pepermint or other flavor extract instead of
vanilla. For colorful popcorn balls, stir a few drops of food
coloring into syrup before adding to popped popcorn. [ Jolly Time
