No, this recipe is not for passionate Peruvians.  It's for folks who
love lima beans.  (If you happen to be a passionate Peruvian, I guess
that's just a bonus!) I've been putting recipes into my computer from
an old, hand written notebook I used to keep back in the Pencil Age
and ran across this.

Combine and bake at 350F for 3 hours.
