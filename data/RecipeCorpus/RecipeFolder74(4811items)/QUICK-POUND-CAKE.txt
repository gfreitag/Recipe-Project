Title: QUICK POUND CAKE
Categories: Desserts, Cakes
Yield: 1 Cake
3    Eggs
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
3 c  Basic Cake Mix
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

Beat eggs until foamy; add milk and vanilla and continue beating.

Add dry mixture to eggs, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each
addition.

Pour into a greased 9-inch loaf pan and bake for 1-1/2 hours.

Idea: For a fruit shortcake, pour batter into a greased 9-inch square
pan and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. When cook, cut cake into
2-inch squares. Slice each square in half, fill with berries and
juice, and replace top half.  Cover with sweetened whipped cream.

Variation: For a chocolate pound cake, add 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa
to the batter before baking.
