"The colors and aromas -- the deep magenta leaves of radicchio, the
rich flavor of walnuts, and the golden hue and pungent fragrance of
ripe cheese, make this a winter dish. The ingredients are tossed in a
mustard-spiked dressing on top of large, thin slices of garlicky
grilled bread, and each person is served a piece of bread with its
share of salad."

Lightly grill or toast the bread and rub one side of each slice with
the cut clove of garlic.

Line a seving dish with the grilled bread and distribute the
radicchio over the bread slices. Top with the Gruyere cheese shavings
and sprinkle with chopped walnuts.

In a small bowl combine the olive oil, vinegar, mustard, and salt and
pepper to taste. Beat with a fork until well blended.

Pour the dressing over the salad and carefully toss the salad on top
of the bread, using it as a base. Correct the seasonings. Each person
is served a piece of grilled bread topped with salad.
