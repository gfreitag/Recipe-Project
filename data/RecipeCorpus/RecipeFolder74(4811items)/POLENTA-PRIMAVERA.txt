Title: POLENTA PRIMAVERA
Categories: Pulses and, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
3 c  Water
1 1/2 c  Cornmeal
1    Onion -- chopped
2    Cloves garlic
1    Red bell pepper
1    Zucchini
1 sm Eggplant -- (optional)
6 oz Mushrooms
Fresh or dried marjoram,
Oregano, basil
Fresh ground pepper
Salt
Bring water to boil in heavy pan.  Lower to simmer. Add corn meal in
VERY FINE STREAM, stirring constantly. Once all of meal is added,
keep stirring until the mush pulls away from the sides of the pan or
you feel you are going to start screaming uncontrollably ( It helps
to listen to something very compelling while doing this, either a
spouse, SO, the radio, or a political demonstration). Pour
immediately onto a flat plate, a cake tin, or a tart pan. Smooth top
and cool for 30 minutes until firm.

Meanwhile, saute onions and garlic until lightly brown in olive oil.
Add chopped vegetables and seasonings, cook until soft. Pile, with
juices from veggies, onto polenta. Spread around. Add any seasonings
you want and enough cheese to cover if you want (which is why I
didn't put in amounts). Broil or nuke until melted and toasted sort
of on top. Eat warm or cool.
