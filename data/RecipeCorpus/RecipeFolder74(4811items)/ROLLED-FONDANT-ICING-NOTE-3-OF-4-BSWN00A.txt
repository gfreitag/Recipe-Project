Categories: Icings
Yield: 37 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------HINTS--------------------------------
12. TO DECORATE: Use royal icing only - on rolled f.
Use wax paper to make template patterns. All pat terns should be
even & line up. I use calculator paper for making patterns for sides
of cake. You can accordion-fold it & cut scallops, etc. Place pattern
against cake & mark with sharp object. Modes of decoration for Rolled
Fondant cakes include: ~Lace pieces <trace patter w/#00 tip> ~RIBBON
INSERTION <pieces of ribbon inserted to appear to be lacing in & out
of cake.> ~"CURTAINS" #00 tip <w/smaller tip, less line break!>
First, build out "bridge" of scallops at base by over- piping #13,
then #4,3,& 2. To pipe curtains; start at top <on your marked
pattern,> drape to bottom & slightly under edge of icing "bridge."
Curtains should be close <no wider than width of icing drape
between.> Finish w/#1 tiny "bubble" at top & base of curtains.
~CRIMPERS: use fancy crimpers to press fancy patterns into icing.
~EMBROIDERY: DONE W/#0 to #1 tips. Its like figure- piping. Draw tiny
stems/leaves/flowers onto the cake.
Easy - can wipe off any mistakes. ~LEATHER TOOLS/OTHER PRESSES: Use
these to press pat terns into cake. Hearts, flowers & many other
patterns are available. Tandy leather tools avail. at leather shops.
~DO IMMEDIATELY: ribbon insertion, pattern pressing & crimping. ~When
using GRAYSLAKE gelatin, increase gelatin to 1 1/2 tb. ~If ingred.
get to hot, it may take more confect. sugar ~If gel or filling gets
on icing, use a bit of corn starch/confect.sugar mixture to rub off
the shine. ~Too cold a room can cool icing off too quickly. NO AIR
SHOULD EVER BLOW DIRECTLY ON THE ICING. ~LEFTOVER ICING: Can be
rolled out & cut with cookie cutters, etc., dry & use on other cakes.
*We use a "bib" cutter to make bibs, also booties, hearts, stand-up
characters, all sorts of things. ~Keeps indefinitely sealed &
refrigerated. ~Use for candy center; add flavors/color/nuts, etc..Can
add butter to thin. Dip in dipping chocolate. ~Make candy "rocks":
marble-color & shape. *Continued note 4......
