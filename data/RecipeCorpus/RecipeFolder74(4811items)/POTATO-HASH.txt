Title: POTATO HASH
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 2 Servings
450 g  Potatoes, cooked
50 g  Butter or margarine
100 ml Milk
Salt and pepper
Oil for frying
Serves 2-3

You can use leftover baked potatoes for this dish if you have them
around. The simple device of browning a cake of mashed potatoes until
it is golden on both sides is one of the most delicious ways of
cooking potatoes. Warming, satisfying food.

Mash the potatoes thoroughly with the butter or margarine, and beat
to a smooth purÂ‚e with the milk. Season well with salt and pepper.
Put a little oil into a heavy bottomed pan and press the mixture down
into it. Fry until the bottom is well browned, over a very low heat -
about 20 minutes. Turn over and brown the second side for a further
20 minutes or so. Turn out on to a warm serving-dish.
