MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Sesame oil

* (to produce approximately 1 1/2 cups of shredded chicken)

1.  Mix well, separately, seasoning and sauce ingredients.

2.  Bring stock (or salted water) to the boil, immerse chicken
breasts and turn off flame.  Soak until cooled, then shred into
strips. (Alternatively, for authentic and finer texture, cover
breasts with a clean cloth and shred by hitting them with a
mallet++hence the sound of ponpon.)

3.  Lay bean paste sheets in a suitable flat container, and blanch in
hot water for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and rinse under cold running
water. Drain and cut into finger-sized strips and mix with sauce
mixture.

4.  Spoon into serving dish, pile shredded chicken on top and pour
seasoning mixture over.
