Title: RASPBERRY VINEGAR - RON'S EASY METHOD.
Categories: Salad/dress, Pickle/reli
Yield: 1 Litres
250 g  Ripe Raspberries
1 l  Wine Vinegar
Take the raspberries and soak them for at least 10 days in the wine
vinegar.  Strain the mixture through a fine sieve or muslin cloth
[cheese-cloth].  Heat the mixture to just under boiling. Cool and
bottle in sterilised containers. Sterilise [we spell it this way!]
Colonials should substitute a 'z'

:-) Ron's note: You can substitute strawberries and make Strawberry
Vinegar if you wish!
