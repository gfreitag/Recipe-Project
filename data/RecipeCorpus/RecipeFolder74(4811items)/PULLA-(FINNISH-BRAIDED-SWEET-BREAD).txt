1/2    To 3/4 cup warm water
4 tb Sugar
1 pk Active dry yeast
2    Eggs
2 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Cold butter or margarine,
-cut into 4 pieces
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground cardamom
Makes 1 loaf

Crushed sugar cubes, pearl sugar and/or sliced almonds

Combine 1/4 cup of the water, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and yeast.
Stir to dissolve yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes.
Add 1 egg and stir until blended.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, butter, remaining 3
tablespoons of the sugar, salt and cardamom into work bowl. Process
until mixed, about 15 seconds.

Add yeast mixture to flour mixture.  Process until blended, about 10
seconds.

Turn on processor and very slowly drizzle just enough remaining water
through feed tube into flour mixture so dough forms a ball that cleans
sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl about 25
times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining water to
make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface.  Shape into ball and place in
lightly greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover with plastic
wrap and let stand in warm place until coubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough.  Divide dough into 3 equal parts. Shape each part
into 18-inch strand.  Braid strands together and place on greased
cookie sheet. Tuck ends under and pinch to seal. Cover loosely with
plastic wrap. Let stand in war place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Heat oven to 375 F.  Beat remaining egg with fork. Brush egg over
braid. Sprinkle with sugar and/or almonds.

Bake until loaf is evenly brown, 20 - 25 minutes. Remove from cookie
sheet and cool on wire rack.
