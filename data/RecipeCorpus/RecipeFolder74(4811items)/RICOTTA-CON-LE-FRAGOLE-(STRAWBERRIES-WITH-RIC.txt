Unlike most other cheeses, Italian ricotta is comparatively low in
fat and has only 420 kilojoules per 100 g compared to cream's 1400.
So this recipe for ricotta cream is an excellent and rich-tasting
alternative to whipped cream.

Hull 3 punnets of strawberries and put them in 1 large or 6 individual
dishes.  Put 450 g ricotta cheese in a food processor and add 2 egg
yolks, 2 tablespoons of rum, the grated zest of a lemon and 3
tablespoons of honey or sugar.  Process, pour over the strawberries
and chill until serving.

Makes 6 servings.
