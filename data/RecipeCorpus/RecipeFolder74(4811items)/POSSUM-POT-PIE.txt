Title: POSSUM POT PIE
Categories: Game, Main dish, Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Glazed huckleberries
3    Shots gin or moonshine
1    Possum
1    Pie crust with top
Sliced carrots & cabbage
To taste
If roadkill---make jambalaya If caught---proceed with recipe

Cover a pan (or any implement you can put in a fire) with the bottom
of your pie crust and place the possum in it.  Add the huckleberries
and carrots, and shred the cabbage over it.  Close up the pie and
bake until the neighbors' dogs come sniffing around to see what the
wonderful smell is, or until the fire department arrives (whichever
comes first). Remove from fire/oven, slice and enjoy.
