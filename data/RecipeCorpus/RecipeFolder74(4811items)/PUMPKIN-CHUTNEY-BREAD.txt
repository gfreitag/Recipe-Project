2 ts Ground cinnamon
2 ts Ground ginger
1/2 ts Grated nutmeg

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter and lightly flour a
9-by-5-inch loaf pan.

Combine the flour, salt, baking soda and powder, cinnamon, ginger and
nutmeg in a bowl and set aside. In a large bowl, cream the shortening
and sugar together with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in the
eggs and pumpkin puree until well combined. With a wooden spoon, stir

batter. Mix in the pecans and apricots just until distributed evenly.
Spoon the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake until a
toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean, 60 to
70 minutes. Let the bread cool in the pan for 15 minutes and then
invert it onto a rack, turn right side up and let cool completely.
Slice into 1/2 inch thick slices and accompany with butter, if
desired.
