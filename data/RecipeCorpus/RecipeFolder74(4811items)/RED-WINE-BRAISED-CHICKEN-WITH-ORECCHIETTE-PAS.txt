Season chicken liberally with salt and pepper. In a large,
heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons oil and quickly brown
chicken over high heat. Remove and set aside. Add mushrooms, onion,
garlic, carrots, and celery and saute until very lightly browned.

Return chicken to pan and add wine, tomatoes, thyme, sage, and the
stock and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer until chicken is
tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove chicken and cut meat into bite-sized
slices and set aside. Strain braising liquid reserving vegetables and
return liquid to pot. Bring to a boil and cook over high heat for 8 -
10 minutes to reduce and thicken lightly. This also concentrates the
flavors. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper and drops of
balsamic vinegar if using. Add reserve meat and vegetables and heat
through. Stir in parsley and keep warm.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt to taste and
pasta. Cook pasta until just tender, drain and toss with chopped
basil and sun-dried tomatoes. Place pasta in center of warm, large
flat pasta bowls and ladle braised chicken sauce around garnish with
basil springs and shaved cheese and serve immediately.
