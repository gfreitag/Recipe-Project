Categories: Desserts, Cakes
Yield: 12 Servings
Light vegetable oil-spray
5    Apricot halves
-(from an 8 1/4 oz can)
1 c  Sifted flour
2 tb Poppy seeds
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Granulated sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
5    Whites of large eggs,
-at room temperature
2 tb Freshly sqeezed lemon juice
1 c  Confectioner's sugar
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray the interior of a 10-inch bundt
pan once lightly with the vegetable oil spray. 2. Puree the apricot
halves to a smooth consistency in a food processor or blender. (There
should be about 3 rounded tablsepoons.)  In a bowl, stir gotether the
flour, poppy seeds, baking powder and salt until well-combined. 3.
Transfer the apricot puree to a large mixing bowl.  Turn mixer to
medium-high and gradually add 3/4 cup of the granulated sugar,
producing a thick, pale mixture that resembles beaten egg yolk.  Turn
miser to low and add 1/4 cup water and the vanilla. Gradually add the
flour mixture, continuing to beat until incorporated. 4. Using clean
beaters, beat the egg whites at medium-high speed until thick.
Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating until stiff peaks
form and meringue looks glossy. 5. Stir 1/3 of the meringue mixture
into the batter to lighten it, then fold in the remainder. Place in
the oven & bake until a tester comes out clean and the center of the
cake springs back to the touch, about 25 minutes. Transfer to a rack
and cool for 30-40 minutes. 6.  In a small bowl, make a glaze by
whisking together the lemon juice & confectioners' sugar.  Set aside
for 5 minutes. Remove cake from the pan, place on the rack over a pan
and spoon glaze over cake. If desired, garnish each serving with
sliced apricots.
