Title: QUICK SODA CRACKERS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 80 Servings
4 c  All-purpose flour
4 ts Salt
1 tb Baking powder
1/4 c  Plus 2 Tablespoons
Shortening
1 1/2 c  Water
Salt for the tops (opt.)
"These crackers cannot truly duplicate the lightness of traditional
soda crackers, but they take a fraction of the time to make, and they
are delicious in their own right. Plain, slightly biscuity crackers,
they go well with soups or stews. 350~ F 25 to 30 minutes Preheat the
oven to 350~ F. In the food processor or a large bowl, combine the
flour, salt, and baking powder. Cut the shortening into the flour
until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the water, little by
little, and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a
cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 3 equal portions for rolling. On
a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to a rectangle
approximately 1/4 inch thick and position so the long edge runs
horizontally in front of you. Fold the left third of the dough over
the center third. Likewise, fold the right third over the center. The
dough is now in 3 layers with the seam running vertically. Give the
dough a quarter turn so the seam now runs horizontally. Roll out
again to a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Fold and turn the dough
again as in the first step. You are now ready for the final rolling.
Roll the dough out somewhat thinner this time, about 1/8 inch thick.
If desired, sprinkle the top lightly and evenly with salt and roll
over it lightly with the rolling pin. With a sharp knife, cut into
2-inch squares and place them on an ungreased baking sheet. Prick
each square 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork. Bake for 25 to 30
minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack. Yield:  80-85.
