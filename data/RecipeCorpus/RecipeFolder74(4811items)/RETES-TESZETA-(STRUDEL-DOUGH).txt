of the water into the well. Using your fingers, work these
ingredients together, adding the remainingw ater a little at a time
and kneading until the dough can be worked into a ball. Transfer the
dough to a floured bread board and knead it until it is elastic and
no longer sticky. Throw the dough down on the board a number of times
to soften and then knead vigorously for 20 minutes or until surface
blisters form. Dust with flour, cover with an inverted bowl and let
the dough rest for 45 minutes. Cover an oblong table with a cloth
that will overhang the edge by at least six inches. (an old sheet can
be cut for this purpose). Dust the cloth with flour. Place the dough
in the center of the cloth and brush with a little butter. Working
quickly, roll the dough th 1/2 inch thickness. Bring the ends of the
dough over your hands and lift high off the table, allowing the dough
to stretch by its own weight. Return to counter and stretch it until
it is paper thin and overlaps the edge of the table. Cut off the
thick outer edges. Brush dough generously with melted butter and use
it quickly. Prepare the strudel filling before making the dough so
all is ready. (You can also substitute phyllo dough, available frozen
at the supermarket for a good strudel dough) Retes teszta - Hungarian
