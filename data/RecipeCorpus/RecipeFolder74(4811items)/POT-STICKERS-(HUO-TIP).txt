2 ts Cornstarch

2 ts Thin soy sauce
1 ts Hot spiced oil
1 ts White Vinegar
Combine flour and cold water in large mixing bowl. Mix thoroughly to
form dough.  Cover with damp cloth; let stand for 20 minutes. *

Cook cabbage 2 minutes in boiling water.  Rinse in cold water, and
drain. Squeeze dry of all excess moisture. Chop fine; set aside.

Place the ground pork, chopped green onion, chopped ginger, and
preserved vegetables together on chopping board. Mix and chop with
the clever for approximately
15    strokes.

Add "seasoning" and the cabbage to the pork mixture and mix
thoroughly.

After dough has set for 20 minutes, knead it for 1 minute and then
form into 2 to 3 rolls, approximately 1-1/2 inch in diameter. Cut
each roll of dough into slice 1-1/2 inch thick.

With a small rolling pin, or heel of hand, flatten each piece of
dough into a thin patty, 3 inch in diameter. Place 1/4 tablespoon of
the pork mixture in the center of each patty. Fold in half, and seal
the edges by pressing firmly together with your fingers. (Help
ready-made skins to seal by applying egg white to the edges.)

Set each pot sticker with the straight edge on a platter, pressing
firmly so as to form a flat base. Each pot sticker should be made to
stand upright, rather than allowed to rest flat on its side.

Heat frying pan and add 2 tablespoon oil.  On medium heat, pan-fry pot
stickers.  Cook on the base surface only. Pan-fry 2 minutes, until
the base side is nicely browned.

Add 1 cup chicken stock to the pot stickers.  Cover and cook over
medium heat for approximately 7 minutes, until most of the chicken
stock is absorbed.  Remove to platter.

Mix thin soy sauce, hot spiced oil, and white vinegar to use as
condiment for Pot Stickers.

* Pot sticker skins can be purchased at Chinese groceries.
