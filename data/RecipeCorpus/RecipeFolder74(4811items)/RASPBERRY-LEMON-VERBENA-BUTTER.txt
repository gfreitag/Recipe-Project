Title: RASPBERRY-LEMON VERBENA BUTTER
Categories: Spreads, Fruits, Seasonings
Yield: 1 Batch
1/2 lb Unsalted butter
4 oz Fresh or frozen raspberries
-- not in syrup
1 tb Sugar; or to taste
1 sm Handful young, tender lemon
-- verbena leaves
Thaw raspberries if frozen, and pour off any excess liquid.

With all ingredients at room temperature, blend butter, sugar and
raspberries until smooth.  This may take a while (about three minutes
in a food processor), and you may think it's never going to emulsify,
but it will if you persist.  Strip out any large veins in the lemon
verbena leaves, then add the leaves (chopped if you're mixing by
hand) and blend until the texture is pleasing.

Alley notes that "this delightfully sweet and fragrant butter is
excellent on muffins, pancakes or waffles."
