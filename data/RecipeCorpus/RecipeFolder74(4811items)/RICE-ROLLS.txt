Title: RICE ROLLS
Categories: Appetizers, Low fat
Yield: 1 Servings  Take an umeboshi plum and chop it into little pieces distributed
through the rice. Lay some of this rice out on a piece of sushi nori
(that's nori sheets that have been roasted), and roll it up closing
the ends. Do this while the rice is still warm and it sticks together
perfectly. When you bite a piece off, the seaweed wrapper closes
itself with help from your teeth so the rice doesn't fall out.
