Title: POTATOES WITH ASAFETIDA & CUMIN
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 5 Servings
2 tb Light vegetable oil
1/4 ts Whole cumin seeds
1/4 ts Turmeric powder
1 ts Sea salt
1    -2 hot red peppers, dried
4    -5 medium-sized potatoes
1/8 ts Asafetida, ground,
-or 1/8-inch lump
1 1/4 c  Canned tomato sauce
Wash, peel and quarter potatoes.  Place them in a bowl with cold
water to cover.

In 2-3-quart pot, heat oil over medium heat.  As it heats, drain
potatoes in a colander.  When the oil is hot, add asafetida; after it
sizzles in about 5 seconds, add cumin seeds; when they sizzle and
change color in 5 to 10 seconds, add the red peppers, which will
begin to change color in just 2 or 3 seconds. Now add the drained
potatoes and turmeric. Fry the potatoes for about 2 minutes, stirring
occasionally.

Add 2 cups water, tomato sauce, and salt.  Bring to a boil. Cover and
allow to simmer very gently for about 1Â« hours. Serve in a deep dish
and permit diners to ladle individual servings in their own small
bowls. Flatbreads provide an excellent accompaniment to this dish.
Leftovers can be mashed in a blender to reincarnate as a delicious
soup.
