Categories: Digest
Yield: 1 Servings
1 sm Head of cabbage, shredded or
-chopped fine
1 lg Jar of favorite spaghetti
-sauce (or make your own)
1 c  Rice (I used white, but I'm
-sure that brown would work
-too, though
-you may need to add more
-water)
1 c  Water
1 c  Sliced mushrooms (I'm sure
-other veggies would work
-too)
In a dry, nonstick skillet "fry" the rice until it's brown in color.
Then put half of it in the bottom of a large casserole dish. Layer
half of the shredded cabbage on top of it.

Mix the water and the spaghetti sauce and then pour half of it over
the cabbage.  Spread half of the mushrooms over this. Then repeat
your layers.

Bake for about an hour in a 350 degree oven.
