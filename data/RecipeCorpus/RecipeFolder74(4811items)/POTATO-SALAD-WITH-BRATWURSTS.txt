PUT POTATOES IN 3-QUART POT. Cover with water. Add salt and tarragon.
Add fresh bratwursts, if using. Bring to boil. Boil, uncovered, until
potatoes are almost tender but still with some firmness. Add onions,
peas and carrots. Cook 1 minute longer. Drain contents of pot in
large, fine strainer. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut in
half. Split cooked or precooked brats lengthwise, then into 1/2-inch
thick slices. Heat oil in 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high
heat. When hot, add sliced brats. Cook until well browned, about 3
minutes, stirring often. Use slotted spoon to transfer brats to
2-quart mixing bowl. Add potatoes to skillet, cut side down. Cook
until browned, about 2 minutes. Use slotted spoon to transfer them to
bowl along with sliced green onions and remaining vegetables in
strainer. Toss gently to combine. FOR DRESSING: Add all ingredients
to any fat remaining in skillet. Stir well. Heat through but do not
boil. Pour over salad. Toss gently to combine. Adjust seasoning. Can
be served immediately or refrigerated as long as 1 day. If
refrigerated, toss gently to mix ingredients. Adjust seasoning. Can
be served at room temperature or warm. If serving warm, reheat gently
in non-stick skillet or in microwave oven on medium power (50 %)
until warm, not hot. Arrange lettuce leaves on serving plate. Mound
potato salad on top. Alternately, salad can be served in shallow soup
plates (omit lettuce).
