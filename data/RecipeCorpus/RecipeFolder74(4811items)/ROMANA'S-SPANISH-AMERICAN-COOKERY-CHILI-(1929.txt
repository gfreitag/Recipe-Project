This California-based cookbook, edited and "modernized" in 1929 by
Pauline Wile-Kleeman, has three chili recipes. The one labeled "Texas
style" contains onions, beans and tomatoes, plus a whole cup of extra
fat, half suet and half lard! The "California" version is also made
with beans, but without tomatoes or onions. The first, and best
recipe has none of these things.

Chile con Carne without Beans

Remove the seeds and veins from the chile peppers, place in
sufficient hot water to cover, bring to boiling point, and cool in
the water, drain and remove the pulp with a spoon. Cut the meat and
suet in 3/4 inch cubes, heat the oil and fry the meat and suet to a
light brown, then add onions and garlic and continue to cook,
stirring continuously; before the onions start to brown add chile
pulp, paprika, stir a few minutes, then add oregano, salt and pepper
and sufficient stock to finish cooking till the meat is tender. Serve
with beans or Spanish rice.
