Title: RENATO'S BBQ PIZZA
Categories: Pizza
Yield: 3 9" pies
3    9-inch pizza shells
3 oz Barbecue sauce
3 oz Mozzarella cheese, shredded
3 oz Yellow cheddar, shredded
3 oz Monterey jack, shredded
1 oz White onion, sliced
1 oz Bermuda onion, sliced
2    Chicken breasts*
1 1/2 oz Jalapeno peppers, chopped
* very thinly sliced; then marinated in BBQ sauce

Ladle the BBQ sauce around the whole crust and spread evenly. Add
mozzarella, yellow cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Next, add 1 oz.
onion mixture and the sliced chicken breast. Top pizza with the
jalapeno peppers. Bake 3-4 minutes at 700 degrees in wood-fired oven.

NOTE: Does *your* oven go that high??  I'm sure baking at 450 degrees
for a little longer would be fine.
