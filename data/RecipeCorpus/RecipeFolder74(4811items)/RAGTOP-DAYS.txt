These are my  Watermelon Shots I think I'll call Ã”em RAGTOP DAYS Get a
really big slice of watermelon, remove the seeds. (enough to fill a
blender a bout 1/3 the way.) triple shot of 151 rum (what the hell,
turn the bottle over until you say, Hmm... that should be enough) two
hand fulls of crushed ice. Juice of a lime or a shot of lime juice.
Throw it all together in a blender and go for the max setting until
its just a blur. Pour into a old mason jar and garnish with a one
inch cube of watermelon. Drink while reclining in a hammock or with
your feet dangling in the pool. Forget about cutting that grass.
