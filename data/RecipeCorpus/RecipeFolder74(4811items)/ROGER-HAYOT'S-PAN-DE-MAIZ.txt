Categories: Mexican, Breads, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Butter, melted
1/4 c  Canola oil
1 c  Low-fat or whole milk,
-warmed
1    Egg, room temperature
1 c  Cake flour
1 tb Baking powder (preferably
-non-aluminum type)
2/3 c  Yellow cornmeal
3 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
Preheat oven to 400F.  Oil a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Combine butter,
oil, milk and egg in mixing bowl and whisk until well-blended.

Stir the flour, baking powder, cornmeal, sugar and salt together with
a fork until well-mixed.  To this dry mixture, add the liquid milk
mixture and stir just until combined.

Pour into baking dish.  Bake the cornbread until golden on top and a
tester inserted in the middle comes out clean. Baking time is about
25 minutes.

HINT:  If you are in a hurry you can use Jiffy cornbread mix (8 1/2
ounce size).  To the dry mix, add 1/2 cup evaporated milk, 1 egg and
1 tablespoon melted butter in place of what is called for on the
package.

Bake at 400F for 20 minutes.  Bread should be golden brown and a
tester plunged into its middle should come out clean.
