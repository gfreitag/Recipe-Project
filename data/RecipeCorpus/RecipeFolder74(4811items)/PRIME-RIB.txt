Before you start preparing this recipe you need to know that it will
create a considerable amount of smoke in your house during the early
stages of preparation.  Preheat your oven to 500oF and verify with an
oven thermometer that your temperature is correct. While oven is
preheating let your prime rib stand at room temperature for at least
1-1/2 hours, longer if possible to allow the inside of the roast to
warm up as this will effect the cooking by this technique. Place the
roast in a baking pan on a flat rack.  Place roast in the preheated
500oF oven for 5 minutes per pound. ONCE YOU HAVE PLACED THE ROAST IN
THE OVEN YOU MUST, MUST, MUST LEAVE THE OVEN DOOR CLOSED. DO NOT OPEN
THE OVEN DOOR FOR ANYTHING. After cooking for 5 minutes per pound,
turn off the oven. Continue to leave the OVEN DOOR CLOSED.  Let the
roast set in the hot oven for 2 hours, with the DOOR CLOSED. The
roast is ready to carve when it comes out of the oven since the
juices have been reabsorbed while the roast has been setting in the
oven. Carve and serve. Bon a Petite. From: Melinda Lee, KNX Food News
