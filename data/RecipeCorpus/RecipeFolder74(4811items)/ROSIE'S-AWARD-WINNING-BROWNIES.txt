Preheat the oven to 325'F. Lightly grease an 8" square pan with
butter or vegetable oil.

Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler placed
over simmering water. Cool the mixture for 5 minutes. Place the sugar
in a medium-size mixing bowl and pour in the chocolate mixture. Using
an electric mixer on medium speed, mix until blended, about 25
seconds. Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula.

Add the vanilla. With the mixer on medium-low speed, add the eggs one
at a time, blending after each addition until the yolk is broken and
dispersed, about 10 seconds. Scrape the bowl after the last egg and
blend until velvety, about 15 more seconds.

Add the flour on low speed and mix for 20 seconds. Finish the mixing
by hand, being certain to mix in any flour at the bottom of the bowl.
Stir in 1/2 cup of the nuts.

Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan and sprinkle the
remaining 2 tablespoons of nuts over the top.

Bake the brownies on the center oven rack until a thin crust forms on
top and a tester inserted in the center comes out with a moist crumb,
about 35 minutes. The center of the brownies should never quite rise
to the height of the edges.

Remove the pan from the oven and place it on a rack to cool for 1 hour
before cutting the brownies. Serve the next day - it takes a day for
the flavor to set.

Makes 9-12 brownies.
