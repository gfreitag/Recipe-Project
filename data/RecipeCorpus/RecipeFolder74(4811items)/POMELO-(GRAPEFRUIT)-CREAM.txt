Title: POMELO (GRAPEFRUIT) CREAM
Categories: Pudding
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/3 c  Pomelo or grapefruit juice
1 1/2 ts Cornstarch
2/3 c  Sugar
3 lg Eggs
In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the pomelo or grapefruit
juice and the cornstarch and stir until smooth.

Put the remaining juice in a medium nonaluminum saucepan. Add the
sugar, place over medium heat, and cook, stirring, until the sugar
melts. Whisk in the cornstarch mixture and remove from the heat.

With a whisk, lightly beat the eggs in a large bowl. Whisk the warm
juice into the eggs. Pour the mixture into a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish
and cover with aluminum foil, pressing the foil around the rim to
seal.

Put the souffle dish on the steamer rack, place over simmering water,
cover, and steam until the pudding is set and a knife inserted into
the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.

Remove the souffle dish from the steamer pot and let cool. Refrigerate
until chilled. Serve cold.
