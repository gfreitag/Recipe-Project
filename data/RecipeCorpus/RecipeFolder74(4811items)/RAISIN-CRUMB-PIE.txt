and add the cold water and 1 1/2 cups of sugar. Cook until raisins
are tender and plump. Set aside to cool. Mix the flour, 1 1/2 cups of
sugar and the shortening, crumbling well with the finger tips. Take
out one cup of these crumbs and set aside. To the remaining crumb
mixture add the eggs and milk, and mix well. Stir in the baking
powder. Line two large pie pans with pie pastry, and fill with cooked
raisins, pour over this the batter and sprinkle the top with the cup
of reserved crumbs. Bake at 440-F for 10 minutes; reduce heat to
350-F and finish baking about 35 minutes. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch
