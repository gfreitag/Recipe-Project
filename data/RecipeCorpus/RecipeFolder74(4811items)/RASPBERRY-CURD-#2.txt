Title: RASPBERRY CURD #2
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 pt Raspberries
1/2 c  Sugar -- approximately
4 tb Unsalted Butter
1 1/2 ts Lemon Juice -- to taste
2    Eggs
2    Egg Yolks
Puree the raspberries and put them through a fine strainer to remove
the seeds.  Measure 1 1/2 cups puree, heat it in a non-corroding
saucepan, and stir in the sugar and butter. Taste and add the lemon
juice to taste. Whisk the eggs and egg yolks just enough to mix them,
then stir in some of the hot puree to warm them. Return to the pan
and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is
thick ~- it should reach a temperature of 170 degrees F. Chill.

Makes about 2 cups, enough to fill one 9-inch tart.
