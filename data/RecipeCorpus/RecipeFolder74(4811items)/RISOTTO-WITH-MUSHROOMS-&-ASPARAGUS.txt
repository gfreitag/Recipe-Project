Title: RISOTTO WITH MUSHROOMS & ASPARAGUS
Categories: Wasnone
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Mushrooms -- assorment
1 lb Asparagus
1 sm Onion -- chopped very fine
1 lb Arborio rice
Olive oil and butter
1 qt Chicken stock
1 qt Red wine -- see options
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper
Assorted mushrooms: crimini, shitake, oyster; or combination of
standard white, dried morel or porcini soaked in warm water one hour.
OPTIONS: Need 2 quarts of liquid to cook the risotto. Half should be
chicken stock but the rest can be either wine, mushroom liquid, or
vegetable stock; or some combination. For a red wine, try Barbera
D'Alba.

Saute mushrooms in a little olive oil and butter and set aside. Blanch
asparagus by a quick dip in boiling water until they turn bright
green. Then plunge them in a bowl of ice water (not tap water). Chop
off the tips and three or four inches os stalk. Save the rest for
soup. With a low flame under the heaviest saucepan or saute pan you
have: saute onion in a butter/oil combo until clear. Add rice and
coat the grains with the oil. After a couple of minutes start adding
liquid a little at a time, just enough to cover the rice. Stir often
with a wooden spoon. Alternate chicken stock and the wine or other
liquid. Continue adding the liquids a little at a time. The rice is
done when it is still firm at the very middle of the grain but not
crunchy to taste. This takes about 25 minutes. When it reaches this
stage, add the mushrooms, a tablespoon of butter, the cheese, the
salt and pepper, and thee sections of asparagus, saving the tips to
decorate the tope of the dish.
