Even if you hate liver and onions, you'll find this tender, soulful
version a revelation.  If you like liver and onions, you're about to
see star bursts. This recipe is based on a dish by brilliant chef
Pookie Turner.

1.  Season liver with salt and pepper, to taste. Dredge lightly in
flour.

2.  Heat lightly oiled heavy skillet over high heat until fragrant,
about 1 minute.  Add liver and fry until lightly browned, about 1
minute per side. Remove liver and reserve.

3.  Clean skillet and return it to stove over medium heat until dry.
Add butter, and heat until it is melted. Add green onions, garlic,
and onions; fry, stirring, until onion is translucent (about 6
minutes).

4.  Sprinkle the 1 1/2 teaspoons flour over mixture and cook briefly,
until the flour turns golden and loses its raw aroma (about 1
minute); do not let flour brown. Stir in broth, Kitchen Bouquet, 1/2
teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Turn heat to medium-high and
bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, until liquid thickens slightly,
about 6 minutes. Adjust seasoning, if necessary.

5.  Return liver to pan and cook on both sides for 30 seconds each (if
liver is thick, cook for 90 seconds per side.) Remove from heat and
serve immediately with boiled rice.
