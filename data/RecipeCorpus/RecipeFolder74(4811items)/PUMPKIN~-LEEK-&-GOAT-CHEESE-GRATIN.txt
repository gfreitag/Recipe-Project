Title: PUMPKIN~ LEEK & GOAT CHEESE GRATIN
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 Serving
4 lb Sugar pumpkin
2 md Leeks
1    Yellow onion
2    Cloves garlic; peeled
1 c  Young goat cheese; crumbled
2 c  Milk;*
4    Sprigs thyme
* or 1 cup each milk and cream for a richer gratin

Preheat oven to 375 F. Peel pumpkin, quarter, remove seeds and
strings. Slice into 1/4-inch thick "planks" and set aside.

Trim leeks, remove tough outer leaves, and wash free of all dirt.
Slice across in thin julienne strips. Peel, halve and julienne the
onion, and slice the garlic thinly.

Saute the leeks, onion and garlic together in olive oil until tender.
Season well with salt and pepper.

In the bottom of an oiled 10-inch gratin dish, scatter some of the
leek mixture around. Evenly lay the pumpkin slices over the leeks,
completely covering the surface. Scatter more of the leek mixture
over the pumpkin and dot  with crumbled goat cheese. Season with
salt, pepper and chopped thyme leaves. Moisten with the milk. Repeat
this until layers fill the dish; then add enough milk to submerge the
ingredients completely.

Cover and bake on a sheet for about 30 minutes or until the pumpkin is
tender. Carefully pour off the excess milk and dot the surface of the
gratin with more goat cheese. Place under the broiler for a few
minutes until the surface is lightly browned.
