Rum-Flamed Bananas

Peel bananas, cut in half crosswise.

Melt butter in chafing dish pan over direct heat.

Place  bananas  in hot butter; sprinkle with mixed sugars and cook
until browned lightly on all sides, about 4 to 6 minutes.

Pour  the  rum over the bananas; ignite the rum, and serve on dessert
plates.  Serves 4.

(I sometimes serve this over French Vanilla Ice Cream, heaven! I also
have a terrific Crepes Suzette recipe that's great for company.
Crepes can be made ay ahead of time and frozen until the day you need
them. Let me know!)
