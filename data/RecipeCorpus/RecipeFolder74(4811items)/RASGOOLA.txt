Title: RASGOOLA
Categories: Desserts, Indian
Yield: 1 Servings
1 l  Homogenized Milk
2 ts White Vinegar
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3 c  Water
1. Bring the milk to a boil and add vinegar to the boiling milk to
separate the whey. 2. Throw away the liquid part by sifting the stuff
onto a muslin cloth. 3. Pour some cold water over the curd to cool
and wash it. Throw the water and hang the cloth for 15-20 minutes to
let the excess water drip off. 4. Put the curd in a food processor or
blender and blend at high speed to get a smooth consistency. You may
add just a little (1 tsp or so) water while blending, if the curd is
too dry and will not blend. Be very careful so as not to add any
extra water. 5. Remove the paste and make small balls (1 to 2 inches
in diameter). 6. Boil water in a wide vessel. Make sure that there is
at least 2-3 inches of water in the vessel. If not, put more water
and increase the quantity of sugar proportionately. Add sugar to
boiling water to make a light syrup. 7. Continue boiling the syrup
and gently drop the curd balls in the boiling syrup. Cook the balls
in the boiling syrup for 30-40 minutes. 8. Remove from the heat and
let the stuff cool down. Put the balls and the syrup in a storage
container and refrigerate (don't freeze). 9. Serve cold.
