Title: PORK SPARERIBS IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE
Categories: Pork
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Pork Ribs
2 qt Water
2 tb Salty black beans
2 tb Oil
1    Garlic cloves; crushed
1    Scallions; chopped
2 1/2 c  Chicken stock
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1 tb Thin soy sauce
1 tb Oyster sauce
2 tb Cornstarch
4 tb Cold water
1. Have the butcher cut the spareribs into strips 1 1/2" wide and you
cut the bones apart and trim off the fat.

2. Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil, and parboil the meat for 3
minutes; drain well.

3. Wash black beans thoroughly two times; drain, and then crush beans
with the handle of your cleaver or chop very fine with a sharp knife.

4. Heat wok, add oil, garlic and spareribs.  Stir-fry for 5 minutes.

5. Add black bean mixture and all remaining ingredients except the
cornstarch and 4 tablespoons cold water. Bring to a fast boil and
then turn to medium heat, cover, and cook for 40 minutes.

6. Make a thickening with cornstarch and 4 tablespoons cold water and
add to the sparerib mixture.  Bring to a boil again, and serve.

NOTE: Pork spareribs with black bean sauce will still taste delicious
the second or third day.  Reheat for 7 minutes before serving. Serve
over rice as a plate dinner, accompanied by a condiment prepared with
Chinese Hot Mustard.  Hot mustard requires 2 tsp. dry mustard to 2 t.
cold water.
