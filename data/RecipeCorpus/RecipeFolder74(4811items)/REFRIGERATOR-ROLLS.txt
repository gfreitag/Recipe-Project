Title: REFRIGERATOR ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Stick of margarine
1 c  Boiling water
1 1/2 c  Cold water
2    Eggs
3/4 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 pk Yeast
7 c  Flour
Melt the margarine in boiling water.  Add cold water, eggs, sugar,
salt and yeast.  Beat until frothy.  Add enough flour to make a
sticky dough, about 7 cups. This is better if allowed to remain in
the refrigeratore overnight, but may be used right away. Roll out
rolls after it has risen once. Brush tops of rolls with butter. Bake
at 400 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes. Makes about 40. Randy Rigg
