Title: POTATO PARSLEY BISQUE
Categories: Soups, Vegetarian, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Raw almonds or cashews
5 c  Vegetable stock or bouillon
1 lb Red-skinned potatoes
-- unpeeled,
-- cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 md Leeks; sliced
-- (thoroughly washed)
1 c  Finely chopped fresh parsley
1 ts Freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 ts Fine sea salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
Blanch the almonds in boiling water for 30 seconds. Drain, and plunge
almonds into cold water.  Drain, and squeeze the almonds between your
fingertips to remove the skins. Compost or discard the skins.

Put the blanched almonds and 1 cup of the vegetable stock in a
blender, and blend until smooth, about 1 minute.

In a large pot, combine the potatoes, leeks, and the remaining 4 cups
vegetable stock and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cover and boil
until the potatoes are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Stir the blanched almond mixture, parsely, lemon juice, salt, and
pepper into the soup.  Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring often,
until thickened, about 2 minutes. Transfer the soup to a food
processor and process, in batches if necessary, until smooth.

Serve immediately.
