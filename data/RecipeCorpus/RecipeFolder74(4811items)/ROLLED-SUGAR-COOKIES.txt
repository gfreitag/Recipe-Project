Title: ROLLED SUGAR COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 36 Servings
1/2 c  Margarine
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
1    Egg
2 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
Cream together the margarine, sugar, vanilla and egg until light and
fluffy.  Add about 3/4 of the flour and the baking powder, reserving
the rest of the flour for rolling. Blend until well mixed. Chill the
dough for 2 hours or overnight.

Roll out on a lightly floured surface until 1/8 inch thick. Cut with a
cookie cutter.  Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in a 375
degree oven until lightly browned, about 5-10 minutes. Cool before
storing. Makes about 72 cookies 2 inch size or 6 small cookie sheets
of various sizes.

My note:  If you aren't too fussy, square or random shapes from the
edges can be cut with a plastic knife or anything that is safe to use
on your rolling surface. Decorate with a tiny piece of a cherry,
raisin or nut.
