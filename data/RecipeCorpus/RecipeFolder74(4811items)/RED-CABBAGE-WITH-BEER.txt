Recipe by: dz234@cleveland.freenet.edu (Helen B. Greenleaf) Place all
ingredients in a covered pot  (I always use one of my Le Cruesets) and
bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook slowly for about an hour. Taste
and adjust seasonings. If there's too much liquid, uncover and cook
until most of the liquid is evaporated.
