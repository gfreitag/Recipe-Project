Impressive and special, this is a celebration cake. The layers are
thin and fragile, so be careful when removing them from the pans.

Cake ~--- Combine the cocoa and boiling water and set aside. Cream the
butter, shortening, sugar, salt, and vanilla until fluffy. Add the
eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir the soda
into the buttermilk and add alternately with the flour to the creamed
mixture.

Preheat oven to 350 F. Prepare 3 9-inch cake pans by greasing them and
lining them with waxed paper. Measure 1 2/3 cups batter into a small
bowl and stir in the sour cream, maple syrup, and nuts. Pour into 2
of the cake pans.

Blend the cocoa-water mixture into the remaining batter and pour into
the remaining pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Cool 5-minutes before
removing from the pans. Spread Cocoa Maple Frosting between the
layers, on the sides, and over the top of the cake.

Cocoa Maple Frosting ~------------------- Combine the butter, cocoa,
corn syrup, and maple syrup. Add the confectioners' sugar alternately
with the milk. Beat until smooth and of a spreading consistency.
