~----------------- Remove the paper skin from each head of garlic.
Place root side down in a baking dish. Make sure garlic heads are
secure so they don't move around during roasting.  Drizzle some olive
oil over each head. Sprinkle with dried thyme and fresh rosemary. Top
each head with butter. Cover and place in a preheated 275Ã¸F oven for
30 minutes.  Uncover baking dish and baste each head with melted
butter. Continue baking for an additional 90 minutes, with regular
basting. This is excellent served as a spread over fresh French bread
or roasted potatoes.  From: Syd's Cookbook.
