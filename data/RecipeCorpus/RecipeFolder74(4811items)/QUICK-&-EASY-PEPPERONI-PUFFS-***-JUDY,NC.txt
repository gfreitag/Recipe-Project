Are you looking for a pepperoni dinner roll? Sorry, I don't have a
recipe for those, but I have a recipe for pepperoni puffs. I use
these for at cocktail parties. If you like pepperoni, these are very
easy and delicious. They always disappear fast. Add enough hot water
to cover minced onion and let soak a few minutes until softened.
Drain well. Chop pepperoni in food processor.  Blend grated cheddar,
pepperoni and onions in small bowl. Add enough mayonnaise to moisten
well. Divide crescent rolls into four rectangles tangles, pinching
perforations together. Leaving a 1/2 inch border all around each
rectangle, spread the pepperoni mixture between borders.  Roll up
each rectangle into a log, pinching seams on all edges. Cut each log
into 1 inch rounds. Then cut each round in half. Put rounds into
greased miniature muffin tins.  Bake at 375 degrees for 8 minutes.
Remove immediately from tins using a spoon. Serve warm. (Can be
frozen and reheated).The variations you can add to this are
endless.Just to name a few: 1.Chopped green olives
2.Chopped Ripe olives 3.chopped canned mushrooms 4.grated
mozzarella cheese 5.grated Muenster cheese 6.crumbled Italian
seasonings I hope someone else will post something that you can use.
