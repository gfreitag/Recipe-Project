Categories: Low fat, Salads
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Cumin seeds
2 tb Paprika
1 tb Coriander seeds
1 ts Cayenne pepper
1 tb Powdered ginger
1 tb Cinnamon
1 ts Powdered mustard
8    Red Bliss potatoes about the
Size of golf balls
2 md Cucumbers
2    Firm mangoes (or papayas)
1/2    Red bell pepper, seeded
1/4 c  Orange juice
2 tb Minced ginger
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
1/4 c  Chopped fresh mint
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper to taste
1.  Place the cumin, paprika, coriander, cayenne, ginger, cinnamon and
mustard in a small saut? pan, and heat over medium heat until the
first tiny wisp of smoke appears, about 3-4 minutes. Allow to cool to
room temperature, then grind in a coffee grinder or with mortar and
pestle. Set aside.

2.  Cook the potatoes in boiling water to cover until they are easily
pierced by a fork but still offer some resistance, about 8 minutes.
Drain, allow to cool to room temperature and cut in thirds.

3.  Meanwhile, peel the cucumbers, cut them in half lengthwise, and
cut the halves into half-inch slices. Peel and pit the mangoes and
cut the flesh into bite-sized chunks. Cut the half bell pepper into
thin strips.

4.  In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, cucumbers, mangoes and bell
pepper.  Add the orange juice, ginger, lemon juice, mint and 1
tablespoon of the spice mixture. (Place remaining spice mixture in a
tightly covered container and store in a cool, dark place for use in
other dishes.) Toss well, season to taste with salt and pepper, toss
again, and serve.
