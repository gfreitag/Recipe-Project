Title: RHUBARB CHARD FRITTERS
Categories: Hors d'oeuv
Yield: 1 Servings
8    Stalks rhubarb chard (Swiss
-Chard with red stalks)
1 c  Flour
1/2 t  Salt
1/8 t  Paprika
1    Egg, slightly beaten
2 tb Oil or melted butter

Oil for deep frying
These fritters make a good hot hors d'oeuvre.

Cut green leaves off chard stems and save for boiled greens (or use
them like spinach). Cut stems in 3-inch lengths, wash, and dry. Mix
flour, salt, paprika, egg, oil or butter, and milk. Dip pieces of
stem in this batter, covering them well. Fry in deep fat heated to
375 F or until hot enough to brown a 1-inch cube of bread in 1
minute. Fritters should be cooked through and delicately brown in 3
minutes. Drain on brown paper in a warm oven. Serves:6 - 7
