garlic and basil. Bring to boil again. Reduce heat and simmer 25-35

called for 3 Tbs. olive oil to be added to the water in the very
beginning. The actual name is POPEYE'S SWEE'PEA WITH OLIVE OYL ...and
it is said to contain all of Popeye's favorite - sweet peas, yams ( "
I yam what I yam"), olive oil and of course spinach.
