Title: ROAST CHILIES
Categories: Mexican, Peppers
Yield: 3 Chilies
3    Anaheim, poblano, jalapeno,
-or serrano chilies
Broiler method:  Set oven control to broil.  Arrange whole chilies
with their top surfaces about 5 inches from the heat. (Some people
cut a small slit in the shoulder of each chili to prevent it from
bursting.) Broil, turning occasionally, until the skin is blistered
and evenly browned (not burned).  Remove chilies to a plastic bag and
close tightly; let chilies stand for 20 minutes, then peel.

Anaheim and pablano chilies will roast in 12 to 17 minutes; jalapeno
and serrano chilies, in about 5 minutes.

Gas stove-top method:  Spear a whole chili on a long-handled metal
fork, and hold it about 5 inches from the flame. Turn the chili so
that it roasts evenly.  Place roasted chilies in a plastic bag and
close tightly; let chilies stand for 20 minutes, then peel. The
disadvantage of this method is, of course, that you can't roast a
number of chilies at once.

Roasting enhances the flavor of chilies and makes them easy to peel.
Roasted chilies can be frozen before peeling, a convenience if you
roast a big batch at once; wrap them airtight in plastic wrap.
