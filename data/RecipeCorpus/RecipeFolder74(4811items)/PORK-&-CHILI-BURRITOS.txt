3 lb boneless lean pork, cut in 1/2-inch cubes 1 1/2 lb onions, diced
1/2 lb green bell peppers, diced 1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped 2
tomatoes, chopped 1 t garlic powder 1 T salt 1/2 t ground cumin 1/4 t
ground cloves 1/4 t black pepper 2 bay leaves 1 jalapeno chile,
chopped

1 lb tomatillos

Juice of 1/2 lemon 1/2 C cornstarch blended with 1 C water 12 (12-in.)
flour tortillas Shredded Monterey Jack and cheddar cheeses

Place meat in Dutch oven. Add 1 gallon water and bring to boil.
Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until meat is half-cooked, about 35
minutes. Drain off water. Add onions, bell peppers, cilantro,
tomatoes, garlic powder, salt, cumin, cloves, pepper, bay leaves and
chile to meat and simmer. Remove husks from tomatillos and boil in
saucepan in 1 quart water until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain off
water.  Mash tomatillos, add to meat mixture and simmer, stirring
constantly 15 minutes. Add lemon juice. Stir cornstarch mixture then
stir into meat mixture and simmer 15 minutes longer, stirring
constantly. Heat tortillas gently until softened (heat 1 at a time
directly on burner of range or wrap in foil and place in 350F oven a
few minutes). To make burritos, place heaping 1/2 cup meat mixture on
each tortilla. Fold sides in, then roll up from one end. Sprinkle
burritos generously with cheese and place under broiler just until
cheese melts. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40
