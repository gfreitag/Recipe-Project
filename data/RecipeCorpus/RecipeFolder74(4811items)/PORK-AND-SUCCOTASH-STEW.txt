PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. In a Dutch oven or heavy 3-quart pot, heat the
oil over high heat on top of the stove, add the pork in batches and
brown very well. Do not crowd or the meat will not brown. Remove and
reserve the meat on a plate as it is browned. Discard the fat in the
pot. Lower flame, add the onion and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes to
dissolve the browned bits that have stuck to the bottom of the pot.
Return the meat to the pot, add the stock, beans and caraway. Cover
and place in oven for 1 1/2 hours or until pork is tender and the
beans are cooked. Transfer pot to the top of the stove. Add salt,
corn and peppers. Cook, uncovered, over high heat for 5 minutes to
thicken the liquid in the pot. Stir constantly. Remove from heat and
stir in the yogurt. Add the salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.
