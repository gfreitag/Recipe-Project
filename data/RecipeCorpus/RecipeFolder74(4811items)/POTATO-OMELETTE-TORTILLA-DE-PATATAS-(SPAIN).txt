Some times this includes sauteed onions or even chopped tomatoes. It
is served either in small pieces as a tapas( appetizer) or as a main
course. It tastes just as good cold as hot.

Wine: any wine goes well except a sweet white wine

Peel and wash the potatoes, dry them with kitchen paper and cut them
into thick slices. Heat 2/3 of the oil in a round frying pan and cook
the potatoes, covered on a low heat for 15 minutes or until they are
soft. Remove the lid, increase the heat and briefly fry the potatoes
until they are golden-brown . Drain any remaining oil from the pan.
Beat the eggs vigorously in a bowl and stir the potatoes into the
eggs. Season well with salt and pepper and let stand for 15 minutes.
Heat the remaining oil in the pan on a high heat. Add the egg and
potato mixture, spreading our the potatoes evenly and patting down
and leave to cook for a few minutes. Then flip the omelette over with
the help of a large plate or lid and cook the other side until golden
brown. Walt MM
