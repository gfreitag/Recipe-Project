TO MAKE HOT WATER DOUGH: Beat lard or shortening and salt in a large
bowl; gradually, beat in boiling water. Cool to room temperature,
stirring, occasionally to prevent water and lard from separating.
Beat in 2 cups flour, then form dough into 2 balls. Flatten each
portion into a 6" disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill. (If desired
refrigerate overnight or freeze up to 1 month.) TO MAKE PUMPKIN
FILLING: Mix sugar, light brown sugar, flour, bitters, if desired,
cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg and cloves in a large bowl. Stir in
egg; set aside. Melt butter in a large skillet over low heat. Add
pumpkin puree; simmer, stirring occasionally, until puree thickens
slightly, about 10 minutes. Gradually, stir hot pumpkin puree into
the sugar mixture. Stir in evaporated milk, sweet milk and 1 cup
water.(If desired, cover and refrigerate overnight.) TO MAKE PRALINE:
Beat butter and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Stir in pecans and set
aside. (If desired,cover and refrigerate overnight.) ASSEMBLE AND
BAKE: Bring chilled dough to room temperature. Working with one disk
at a time, place on a floured surface. Using half of the remaining
1/4 cup flour, roll into a 13" circle, 1/8" thick.
Transfer and fit dough into a 9" deep dish pie pan; trim away excess
dough and flute the edges with a fork. Repeat with remaining disk of
dough to make a second pie shell. Prick each pie shell all over its
surface with a fork. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Freeze pie shells
for 10 minutes. Spread half of the praline mixture over the bottom of
each pie shell. Bake until praline is golden brown and bubbly, about
10 minutes; cool slightly. Reduce oven temperature to
400    degrees.
Pour half the pumpkin filling into each crust; smooth the top of
each with a spatula. Bake until pumpkin filling in each pie pan is
firm and crusts are golden brown, about 1 hour. Cool completely and
serve.
Makes 2 - 9" pies. Top with whipping cream or whipped topping, if
desired. Garnish with whole pecans.
