Title: RIVIERA CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Medium Chicken
2    Cloves Garlic, peeled
Juice of 1 lemon
2 tb Oil
1 lb Scrubbed New Potatoes
1 lb Cherry Tomatoes
1 ts Sweet Basil
3 ts Chopped Fresh Parlsey
Heat the oil in an oven-proof casserole and brown the chicken on all
sides. Chop the garlic and put into the casserole, pour on the lemon
juice, put the lid on and bake for 40 minutes in a medium oven, gas
mark 4, 350F, 180C. Meanwhile, dice the potatoes into small pieces -
about half an inch - and add to the casserole after 40 minutes.
Continue to bake for another 30 minutes and check to make sure the
chicken is thoroughly cooked. Add the basil and the cherry tomatoes,
arranging them around the chicken, and cook for another five minutes
until the tomatoes are just heated through. Sprinkle with chopped
parsley and serve.
