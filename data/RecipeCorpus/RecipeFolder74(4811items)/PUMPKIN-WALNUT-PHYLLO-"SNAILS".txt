Title: PUMPKIN WALNUT PHYLLO "SNAILS"
Categories: Greek, Appetizers
Yield: 20 Servings
Karen Mintzias
1    Pumpkin (4 to 4 1/2 lbs.)
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
2 tb Ground cinnamon
1 c  Chopped walnuts
1 lb Commercial phyllo sheets
1/2 c  Olive oil or butter; melted
Cut the pumpkin in half, remove and discard the seeds, the peel using
a sharp knife.  Grate the pumpkin on the medium holes of a cheese
grater (there should be approximately 4 cups of finely grated
pumpkin). Taste for flavor, adding more sugar if desired.  Start to
roll the "snails". Lay the phyllo flat and deep, covered with a damp
towel except when rolling. Brush one filo sheet lightly with the oil
and fold in half lengthwise. Spread a row of filling (about 3 to 4
tablespoons) across the length of one end of the filo to within an
inch of each edge. Roll up to seal the filling, forming a long tube.
Then, beginning at one end, curl up tightly into a "snail-like" coil
and set on a baking sheet. Continue until all the filling has been
used, keeping the rolls covered with waxed paper or plastic to avoid
drying.  Brush the rolls with oil or butter and bake in a 350 degree
oven for 25 minutes or until puffy and crisp. Serve warm or cold with
poultry or game dishes.  From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma
