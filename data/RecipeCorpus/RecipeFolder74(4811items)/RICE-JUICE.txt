Categories: Korean, Beverages
Yield: 6 Servings
8 oz Malt flour

1 1/2 ga Water

Here are the two English language recipes that were on the Malt Flour
package from the Korean market. The stuff is distributed by Hanmi,
Inc and packed in the USA, so it may be widely available in oriental
markets. I haven't tried these, but they looked interesting.

Put malt flour into luke warm water and set aside for more than 1
hour. (Don't stir). Pour the upper clean water into electric rice
jar, add steamed rice and sugar, and keep warm for about 4 hours (Do
not boil). When a few rices begin to float, boil the juice and then
cool.
