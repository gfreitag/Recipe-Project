Mel's Instructions
2 DAYS AHEAD:  Put 1 pound whole white corn kernels (hominy) to soak
in a pot, covered with water, overnight. NEXT DAY: Change water and
bring to a boil. Place one heaping tea- spoon unslaked lime in one
cup cold water and add it to the corn through a strainer. Boil the
corn 12 minutes. Cover, and let stand 1/2 hour. Wash the corn in
water several times, removing the thin sheaths on the kernels as you
go. Rinse again. Keep refrigerated. ON DAY OF PREPARATION: Bring to a
boil 5 pounds pork meat (combina- tion pork tenderloin, shoulder,
butt and neck bones). Lower to a simmer for one hour. At the same
time, place the hominy in fresh, cold water - about 14 cups - and
bring to a brisk boil for about 1 hour. The kernels should open.
After the hour, remove the pork from its pot and cut into serving
size pieces. Add the pieces of pork to the hominy. Add 2 Tbsp salt
and allow to cook, uncovered about 4 hours on a slow simmer. Reserve
liquid pork broth from meat and maintain in another pot, simmering.
This should be added to the hominy as needed. ACCOMPANIMENTS:Salsa
picante, finely chopped onion, shredded lettuce or cabbage, lime
wedges, sliced radish, oregano, toasted tortilla.
