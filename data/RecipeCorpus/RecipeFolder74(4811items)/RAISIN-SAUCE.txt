Sweet sauces with pork or game are classic.  This one combines a
little sweetness with the acidity of vinegar for a delightfully
different taste. Serve it with that Easter ham for rave reviews.
Prepare this sauce no more than two days in advance and refrigerate
it. Rewarm over low heat before serving.

In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar and mustard in the vinegar. Place
the mixture in a medium-size heavy saucepan, and add the brown sauce
and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes. Stir in the raisins and
simmer 5 minutes longer.  Serve hot.

Yield:  About 1 cup of sauce.
