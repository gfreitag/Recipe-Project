Title: QUICK BISCUITS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Flour
5 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Shortening
1 c  Milk
Mix and sift the dry ingredients; rub in the shortening and mix with
the milk to a soft, thick dough. Drop by spoonfuls onto a
well-greased tin and bake in a quick oven (425) for about 15 minutes.
These are best when made with butter and come out of the oven as
thin, crusty biscuits rather than the thicker variety. Twelve
biscuits. --Mary Leize Simons
