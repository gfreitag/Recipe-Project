7 oz Zucchini; coarsely grated
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Flour
2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Butter
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/8 ts Nutmeg; freshly grated
2 tb Butter
2 c  Medium mushrooms; quartered
2 tb Green onions; chopped
2 tb Flour
3 tb Whipping cream
3 tb Dry sherry
1/8 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/8 ts Nutmeg; freshly ground
4    Eggs; room temp
3/4 c  Grated Swiss cheese
1/4 c  Romano cheese; freshly grate
1/2 c  Grated Swiss cheese
Butter four 1-1/2 to 2-cup individual souffle dishes. Toss zucchini
and salt in colander.  Let drain 20 to
30    minutes.

Place 1/2 cup flour in heavy large saucepan.  Whisk in milk all at
once, place over high heat and whisk constantly until mixture boils
and is thick and smooth, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add
1/4 cup butter and stir until melted.  Blend in 1/4 teaspoon pepper
and 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg. Transfer to bowl and set aside to cool. Melt
2 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
mushrooms and green onion and saute until softened, about 5 minutes.
Squeeze zucchini as dry as possible. Add to mushroom mixture. Reduce
heat to medium-low and cook until nearly dry, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Add 2 tablespoons flour and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
Blend in cream, Sherry and 1/8 teaspoon each pepper and nutmeg and
cook until smooth and very thick. Let cool.

Beat eggs into milk mixture one at a time beating well after each
addition. Add 3/4 cup grated Swiss cheese with Romano cheese and
blend well. Spread 1/2 cup cheese mixture in bottom of each prepared
souffle dish. Cover with mushroom mixture, divide evenly.  Top with
cheese mixture. Sprinkle each with 2 tablespoons grated Swiss cheese.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake until puffed and golden, 30 to 35
minutes, and serve.
