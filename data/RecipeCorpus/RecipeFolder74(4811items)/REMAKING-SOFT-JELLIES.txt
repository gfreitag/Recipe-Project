TO REMAKE WITH POWDERED PECTIN

tablespoons bottled lemon juice, and 4 teaspoons powdered pectin.
Bring to a boil while stirring. Add jelly and bring to a rolling boil
over high heat, stirring constantly. Boil hard 1/2 minute. Remove
from heat, quickly skim foam off jelly, and fill sterile jars,
leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Adjust new lids and process as

see "Jars and Lids". TO REMAKE WITH LIQUID PECTIN

For each quart of jelly, measure 3/4 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons bottled
lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons liquid pectin. Bring jelly only to
boil over high heat, while stirring. Remove from heat and quickly add
the sugar, lemon juice, and pectin. Bring to a full rolling boil,
stirring constantly. Boil hard for 1 minute. Quickly skim off foam
and fill sterile jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Adjust new lids
and process as recommended in Table 1. TO REMAKE WITHOUT ADDED PECTIN

For each quart of jelly, add 2 tablespoons bottled lemon juice. Heat
to boiling and boil for 3 to 4 minutes. Use one of the tests
described on page 5 to determine jelly doneness. Remove from heat,
quickly skim off foam, and fill sterile jars, leaving 1/4-inch
headspace. Adjust new lids and process as recommended in Table 1.
