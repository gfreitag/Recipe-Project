Title: ROAST BEEF IN BOURBON SAUCE
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 10 Servings
1/2 c  Vegetable Oil
1/2 c  Bourbon
1 lg Onion; Thinly Sliced
2 lg Cloves Garlic; Minced
1 ts Freshly Ground Black Pepper
1 ts Dry Mustard
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Wine Or Cider Vinegar
1    Rib-Eye Or First Cut Chuck
Or Boneless Round Steak;
About 5 to 6 Pounds
Combine the oil, bourbon, onion, garlic, pepper, mustard, salt and
vinegar, blending well.  Place the meat in a plastic bag or glass
dish. Pour the marinade over the meat and marinate 1 hour at room
temperature, turning the meat 2 to 3 times.  Drain the meat,
reserving the marinade. Spit the meat from end to end through the
center or on a diagonal, making sure that the roast is balanced.  If
the meat has not been tied already, tie it after you have fastened it
in place with the spit forks--it will be a little firmer that way.
Engage the spit and turn the meat, 8 to 10 inches above hot coals,
for 1 1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer registers 120 degrees F.
for rare, to  2 1/2 hours for well-done, 165 Degrees F on the meat
thermometer.  Brush with the sauce for the last 30 minutes of
cooking. To roast on the grill, place the meat over a drip pan with
the hot coals surrounding the drip pan, or pushed back. Turn and
baste the meat as needed to cook evenly.  Grill 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours.
Let the meat stand, on a platter, 20 to 30 minutes before carving.
Heat the sauce and serve with the meat.

NOTE:

Any leftovers make great sandwiches and beef salads.
