Title: POTATO SOURDOUGH STARTER
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
-NORMA WRENN   (NPXR56B)
1 pk Dry yeast
4 c  -warm water
2 tb Sugar
4 c  Flour
1    Potato; raw quartered
Here is a recipe from Texas Highways Cookbook.

Dissolve yeast in warm water; and then mix all ingredients in a
1-gallon crock.  (Do not use metal container) Cover with a
close-fitting lid and let the starter rise until light (12 hours in
warm weather, longer in cool weather). Do not let the starter get
cold, ever. After using part of the starter, add 1 cup warm water, 2
teaspoons sugar, and enough flour to mix to the starter's original
consistency.  Add more potato occasionally as food for the yeast, but
don't add more yeast. Use daily for best results. Starter improves
with age. I am sure you will get some posts for flake starters.  I do
not have one.
