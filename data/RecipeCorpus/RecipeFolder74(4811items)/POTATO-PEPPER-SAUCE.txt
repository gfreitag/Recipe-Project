Title: POTATO-PEPPER SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Mine
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lg Baking potatoes
1 lb Kosher or sea salt
1    Jalapeno pepper
Seeded and finely diced
1 tb Cilantro leaves
Finely chopped
2 tb Sour cream
1 tb Rice wine vinegar
1 tb Ketchup
1/2 c  Reserved cooking liquid
From black beans
Or other liquid
(if needed to thin sauce)
Preheat the oven to 425 F.

Wash and dry the potatoes. Spread the salt evenly on a baking sheet.
Place the potatoes on the salt and bake for about 45 min. Remove the
potatoes from the oven and dust off any salt that is sticking to the
skins.

Place the remaining ingredients except the reserved cooking liquid in
the bowl of a food processor. Split the potatoes lengthwise and, with
a spoon, scoop out the flesh and place in the processor. Blend on
high speed for 45 seconds. If the sauce is too thick, dilute to
desired consistency with the reserved bean cooking liquid. The
consistency of the sauce should range between mayonnaise and cream.
