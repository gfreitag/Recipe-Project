Title: POCKET BREAD
Categories: Breads, Low-fat, Mcdougall
Yield: 5 Servings
6 c  Whole-wheat flour
1 tb Honey
1 tb Active dry yeast
2 c  Water; very warm (120)
Recipe by: McDougall In a large bowl, mix 2 cups flour and yeast. Mix
the honey in the warm water. Add the water to the flour mixture and
beat for 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl
occasionally. (Or beat 150 strokes by hand.) Stir in enough flour to
make soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured board. Knead until
smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes, adding more flour if it is
too sticky. Place in bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until
doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, turn onto lightly
floured board. Cover, let rest 30 minutes. Divide dough into 10 equal
pieces. Shape each into a ball. On a lightly floured board, roll each
ball into a 6 inch circle. Place on a lightly floured baking sheet.
Bake on bottom rack of preheated 450 degree oven. Bake about 5
minutes. Tops will not be brown. To brown tops, place under broiler 3
inches from heat, for 1 minute. From the collection of Sue Smith,
