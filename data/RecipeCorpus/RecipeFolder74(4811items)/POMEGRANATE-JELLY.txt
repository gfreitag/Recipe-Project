Title: POMEGRANATE JELLY
Categories: Preserves
Yield: 3 Servings
3 1/2 c  Pomegranate juice
-fresh or frozen, thawed
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1 pk Powdered pectin (2 oz.)
4 1/2 c  Sugar
Prepare 3 pint-sized canning jars, as per normal canning procedures.
In a large kettle, combine the pomegranate juice, lemon juice, and
pectin. Over high heat, bring to a rolling boil, stirring constantly.
Add the sugar and stir to blend; bring to a second rolling boil; then
boil exactly 2 minutes. Remove jelly from heat immediately when time
is up. Let stand a minute to allow foam to form; then carefully
remove the foam. Pour hot jelly quickly into hot jars, filling jars
to within about 1/8-inch of tops. Carefully wipe off rim of jar.  Put
lid on each jar as it is filled, screwing band on as tightly as you
comfortably can. Cool jars away from drafts on a towel. Makes 3
pints. OTHER NOTES: For an easy way to remove seeds, cut the crown
end off each pomegranate and lightly score the peel lengthwise down
the sides in several places. Put the scored fruit in a bowl or sink
of cold water and let soak at least 5 minutes. Holding the fruit
under water, break sections apart with your fingers and separate the
seeds from the pulp; as you work, the seeds sink to the bottom and
the pulp and peel float. With a wire strainer, skim off the pulp.
POMEGRANATE JUICE: Whirl about 1-1/2 to 2 cups pomegranate seeds at a
time in a blender until liquefied. Pour through a cheesecloth-lined
wire strainer and let drain gradually. (Or to speed the straining,
wear rubber gloves and press small amounts of seeds and juice at a
time through the cheesecloth.) Store in refrigerator up to 5 days, or
freeze for longer storage.  One medium-sized pomegranate makes about
1/2 cup juice.
