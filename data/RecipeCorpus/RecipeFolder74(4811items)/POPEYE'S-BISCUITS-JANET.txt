4 c  Bisquick
4 oz Sour Cream
1 c  Club Soda  (room temp)
1    Stick Margarine
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Mix bisquick, sour cream and club soda
together.  Pour onto floured surface and knead very lightly. Roll out
to about 1/2" thickness and cut with cutter. Melt butter and pour
half into a glass casserole dish.  Place biscuits in dish and pour

the club soda has never been refrigerated and still has a lot of fiz.
