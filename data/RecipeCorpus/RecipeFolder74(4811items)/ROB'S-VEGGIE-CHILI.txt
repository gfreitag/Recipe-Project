Title: ROB'S VEGGIE CHILI
Categories: Vegetarian, Slow cooker
Yield: 4 Servings
-olive oil
12 lg Yellow onions, diced
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1    Red pepper, diced fairly
-large
1    Green pepper, diced fairly
-large
2    28oz  cans crushed
-tomatoes
1 tb Cumin
1 ts Cayenne (or to your taste)
1 pk Frozen corn
2 cn Black beans (or any other
-kind of beans you like
-chickpeas work well, too)
11 1/2 c  Picante sauce (Shotgun
-Willie's green sauce very
-hot works well)
-salt to taste
-grated cheddar, if
-desired
-cashew nuts, if desired
Saute onions in the olive oil.  (I used cooking wine instead to cut
out the fat).  Add garlic a bit later. After onion and garlic are
have turned golden brown, add cumin, cayenne, and whatever other
spices you might like. Fry for a couple of minutes.

Next, add the peppers, saute them for a few minutes. Put the crushed
tomatoes, corn, beans and picante sauce into the crock pot, and add
the onion mixture. Cook on low about 10 hours.

Serve with grated cheddar and cashew nuts, if desired.

Note: I didn't have room in my crockpot for 2 cans of crushed
tomatoes, and I had to cut back a little on the corn too, so you will
have to vary the sizes above depending on the size of your crockpot.
