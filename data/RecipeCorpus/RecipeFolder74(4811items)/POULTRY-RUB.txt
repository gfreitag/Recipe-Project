Title: POULTRY RUB
Categories: Rubs
Yield: 1 Servings
4 tb Salt
3 tb Light brown sugar
1 tb Onion salt
1 tb Freshly Ground Black Pepper
1 tb White pepper
1 tb Lemon pepper
1 tb Cayenne pepper
1 tb Chili powder
1 tb Marjoram, dried
1 tb Sage, dried
1 tb Cornstarch
In the top of a double boiler, combine all the ingredients except the
cornstarch.  Heat over simmering water until the ingredients are warm
to the touch. Stir continuously during heating. As the sugar
dissolves, it may forma a crust.

Transfer to a bowl and cool to room temperature. Break the crust and
rub the mixture between your fingers so that it returns to granular
form. Add the cornstarch and stir. Use immediately or store in a
tightly covered glass container in a cool, dark place for several
months.
