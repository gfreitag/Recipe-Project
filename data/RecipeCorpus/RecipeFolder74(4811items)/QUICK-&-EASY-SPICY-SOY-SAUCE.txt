Title: QUICK & EASY SPICY SOY SAUCE
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Soy sauce
x  Garlic powder
x  Powdered ginger
x  Sesame oil
x  Hot oil
I tend to cook without recipes and with a real eye to quickness. In
other words, I'm lazy. Thought I'd share a couple ideas I've come up
with recently (obviously I never measure anything--sorry).

To a partly-full bottle of soy sauce, I add some garlic powder and
some powdered ginger and a little sesame oil and hot oil. I keep this
around (haven't needed to refrigerate it), shake it up and sprinkle a
bit over steamed vegetables (my favorite is green cabbage, sliced
finely). A little goes a long way so I think the fat from the oils is
negligible. The flavor they add is significant.
