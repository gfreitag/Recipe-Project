Title: POPPYSEED BUNDT CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Butter (or margarine)
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2 1/2 c  Flour (sift
-before measuring)
1 ts Baking soda
2 ts Baking powder
1 c  Buttermilk
2 oz Poppy seeds
-(about 1/4 cup)
1 ts Almond extract
-(or vanilla extract)
4    Eggs (separated)
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
Soak poppyseed in the buttermilk for 15 minutes.

Cream together butter and sugar.  Add yolks to creamed mixture. Add
almond extract or vanilla.  Add dry ingredients alternately with
buttermilk mixture, a little at a time.

Beat egg whites very stiff as for angel food.  Fold egg whites into
mixture. Pour half of this batter mixture into well-greased Bundt pan.
Sprinkle with a mixture of about 1/4 cup brown sugar and about 1 t
cinnamon.  Pour in remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 1
hour. Cool and invert onto serving dish, then remove Bundt pan.

NOTES:

*  A light, delicate cake -- I got this recipe from my mom. I'm not
sure where she got it.

*  When folding in egg whites, be gentle.  Lift and turn the batter
instead of using a stirring motion. Don't worry if a little bit of
egg white remains unmixed; the egg whites will collapse if you mix it
too much.

*  I have tried both vanilla and almond extracts with this recipe, and
prefer the former.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate (folding the beaten egg whites into
the batter takes some skill).
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour cooling.
: Precision:  Measure carefully.
