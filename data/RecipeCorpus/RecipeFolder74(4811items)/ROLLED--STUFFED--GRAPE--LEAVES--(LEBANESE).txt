roll leaf forward very tightly.  When fully rolled, squeeze it to
secure. Repeat for each leaf. Neatly place each stuffed roll in the
pot in layers. Pound the garlic with mint and salt to taste. Add 1
cup water and lemon juice and pour over grape leaves in the pot.
Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook, covered, very slowly
for 1 hour. Add more water if needed. Steam until grape leaves are
soft and are pierced and cut easily with a fork. Do not over cook.
The leaves should not fall apart.
