Title: ROTEL CHICKEN
Categories: Main dish, Casseroles, Chicken
Yield: 12 Servings
6 c  Chicken; cooked, cubed
1 pk Vermicelli spaghetti (7 oz)
2 lg Bell peppers; chopped
2 lb Onions; chopped
2    Celery stalks; chopped
1 c  Mushrooms;sliced
1/2 c  Butter
2 cn Rotel tom.; diced (10 oz ea)
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 lb Cheddar cheese; grated
Cook and season chicken.  Save 1-1/2 quarts broth. Cook spaghetti in
broth; drain, but do not rinse.  In dutch oven or heavy pan; saute
pepper, onion, celery and mushrooms in butter. Add tomatoes. Simmer
for about 15 minutes to let the flavors blend.  Add spaghetti,
chicken and cheese. Let simmer for another 15 or 20 minutes until
cheese melts and everything is bubbly.

Note: Flavors blend better if this is prepared a day ahead of time and
refrigerated.

I have also had this made with velveeta, but I MUCH prefer the cheddar
cheese.  Have also seen variations that have english peas. You can
really add more or less of the various vegetables to suit your taste.
This particular version has evolved in our kitchen over the last
dozen years. I also prefer it made with macaroni instead of spaghetti
but I've never seen anyone else make it that way.
