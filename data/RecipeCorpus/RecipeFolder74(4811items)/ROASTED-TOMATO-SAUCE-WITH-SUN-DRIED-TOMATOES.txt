tomatoes, basil and oregano and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes. Add

The editors wrote: "Many of our readers are drying their own
tomatoes, and just a few bits of these rich, deep-flavored sun-dried
nuggets can elevate a simple sauce to something truly special. This
entry compounds that great fresh-tomato flavor by roasting the
tomatoes first."
