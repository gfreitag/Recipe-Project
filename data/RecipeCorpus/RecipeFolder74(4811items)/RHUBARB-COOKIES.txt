Title: RHUBARB COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 30 Cookies
1/4 lb Butter
1 c  Sugar, brown, light
1    Egg
1 c  Cooked rhubarb, drained **
2 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Nutmeg, grated
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground cloves
3 tb Crystallized ginger; finely
-chopped (opt)
1/2 c  Walnuts; chopped
1 c  Raisins
** To cook rhubarb:  Use a proportion of 4 cups sliced rhubarb cut in
1/2-inch pieces to 1 cup sugar.  Toss the rhubarb and sugar together
and let steep overnight (you will be amazed at how much juice the
rhubarb gives off).  Pour off 3/4 cup of the liquid and use for a
drink. Cook the rhubarb slices in the remaining until just tender but
still holding their shape, less than 5 minutes. The rhubarb is ready
to eat as is, to use in other recipes, or to freeze in containers.

Cream the butter and sugar together.  Add the egg and beat until
light, then stir in the rhubarb.  Stir the flour, salt, baking soda,
and spices together and toss until thoroughly mixed. Stir the dry
ingredients into the rhubarb mixture until the two are blended, then
fold in the optional ginger, the walnuts, and the raisins. Drop the
batter by the tablespoonful onto greased baking sheets about 1 1/2
inches apart, and bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 12 minutes,
until lightly browned at the edges.
