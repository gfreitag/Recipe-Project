Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Lightly and quickly sear cubed lamb in
1/3 cup olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Do not let the meat
cook inside.Remove lamb with slotted spoon immediately and place in a
3-qt casserole that has been coated with vegetable spray. Add thyme,
rosemary and pepper to casserole and toss with meat;season with salt.
Cover casserole with lid or a piece of aluminum foil and bake 30
minutes. Lamb should be very tender. When the casserole goes in the
oven, reheat broth with saffron threads (to soften) over medium
heat;set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a saucepan over
medium heat;add rice and saute 2 to 3 minutes. Add 3 cups hot broth
to rice and stir well. Simmer rice, stirring occasionally, until it
begins to have a cremay texture. To do this, add wine and remaining
broth, a little at a time, stirring till liquid is almost absorbed
before adding more. The process takes about 20 to 25 minutes. Do not
overcook;rice should remain slightly firm. Gently stir in asparagus
and Parmesan. Spoon rice in a layer over lamb and garnish with the
chopped tomatoes. VEGETABLE BROTH: Simmer chopped vegetables in water
1 hour. Strain broth and use as directed.
