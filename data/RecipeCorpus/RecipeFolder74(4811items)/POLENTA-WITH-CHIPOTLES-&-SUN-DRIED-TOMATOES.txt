Title: POLENTA WITH CHIPOTLES & SUN-DRIED TOMATOES
Categories: None
Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Water
1 ts Salt
1 c  Polenta or cornmeal
2    Cloves garlic, minced
5    Sun-dried tomatoes
1    Dried chipotle chile pepper
Bring water and salt to a boil over medium-high heat in a heavy
saucepan. Pour polenta in slowly, in a thin stream, stirring
constantly. Add garlic and cook polenta, continuing to stir
constantly, until it starts pulling away from the sides of the pan.

Meanwhile, reconstitute tomatoes and chipotles by pouring boiling
water over both and let sit while polenta cooks. After polenta is
fully cooked, drain, mince softened tomatoes and chipotle and add to
mixture.

Sprinkle drops of cold water over marble pastry board or cookie
sheet. With firm spatula, spread cooked polenta onto board into a
rectangle 1/4-inch thick. Let cool and cut into shapes with cookie
cutters.

Place shapes on cookie sheet sprayed with vegetable cooking spray.
Broil 4-inches from heat source for 5 minutes and serve immediately.
