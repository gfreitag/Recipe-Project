Title: RECIPIE FOR LEFTOVER HAM
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Ground ham
1 lb Ground fresh pork
2/3 c  Bread crumbs
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Green onions
1    Slightly beaten egg
10 oz Red currant jelly
1/3 c  Aro light corn syrup
1 tb Orchestershire Sauce
2 ts Ry mustard
Mix meat, crumbs, milk, onion, egg and a dash of pepper. Shape into a
loaf. Cook in a shallow baking dish.(I use the Deep Dish Baker) Bake
350 degrees oven for 1 1/2 hours. During last 30 minutes, spoon on
Tangy Mustard Glaze as Follows: Combine last four ingredients and
baste ham loaf with glaze. Serve remaining sauce on the side. This is
great for buffet lunches as the ham loaf can be made in advance and
heated before serving. I always serve the cheesy sour cream potatoes
with this dish.
