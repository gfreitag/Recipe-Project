Title: POULET GRANDMERE
Categories: Chicken, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings  2-1/2 - 3 lb. chicken
1    garlic clove peeled
2 T  rendered bacon fat salt and pepper to taste
1/4 c  water 1/4 lb. fat salt pork, diced, blanched for 5 min.and
drained.

1/4    lb. fresh mushrooms 12 (0r more) small boiling onions
peeled sugar
2 T  butter (unsalted) 2 - Medium sized potatoes, diced Chopped
fresh parsley

Place the garlic in the chicken cavity and truss the bird as for
roasting. Place it in a casserole with the bacon grease/lard. Add a
little salt. Put it in a pre-heated 400-425 oven and cook uncovered
until it is well browned all over, turning the bird occasionally and
baste it with the fat. Pour off the fat and reserve.  Add 2-3T of
water and stir in all of the brown crust from the sides of the
casserole. Set the chicken aside in the casserole. In a skillet
saute'  the salt pork in the fat removed from the casserole. When
golden brown  remove the pork and set it aside. Cook the mushrooms in
the fat left in the skillet. season with salt and pepper and set this
too aside. Put the onions in another skillet with 2 T of the water,
and a sprinkling of sugar and 1/2T butter. Cook slowly until water
cooks away and the onions have taken on a good brown color. Reserve.
Add the salt pork, mushrooms, and onions to the chicken, and , if the
gravy has reduced, a little more water. Cover the casserole, reduce
the oven heat to 350 and cook 30 minutes longer  or until chicken is
done, basting often. Cook the potatoes in the remaining butter until
brown and tender and put them on top of the vegetables in the
casserole.  Sprinkle chopped parsley over all. Recipe directs that
all be served from the casserole but as you'll remember, you have to
cut it into serving pieces first. Other vegetables like asparagus and
or peas can be added if desired. Louis Diat French Cooking For
