NOTES:

*  A quick and easy chicken with cheese and marinara ~- This is the
quickest chicken recipe I know. It's especially great for working
parents, although I've used it for entertaining guests, as well. I
don't remember where I got it from. Actually, I think I made it up!

*  If you prefer, this can be prepared using boned chicken, in which
case you should shorten the cooking time to 25 minutes.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 40 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
