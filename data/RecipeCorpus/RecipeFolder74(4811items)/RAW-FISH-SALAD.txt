For a starter course on a warm fall evening, this dish has few peers.

Marinating:  Slice fish with the grain in pencil-thick, 2" strips. Mix
marinade ingredients; blend with fish in bowl. Cover and marinate in
refrigerator for 3 to 8 hours.

Preparations:  Heat oil in wok to medium high. Toss 2 strands of rice
stick noodle in oil to make sure it is hot enough; noodles should
puff up instantly without browning. Deep-fry rice stick noodle
briefly until it expands; drain on paper towels; bag and reserve.
Shred lettuce; bag and reserve in refrigerator. Thinly shred or mince
pickled red ginger; reserve. Chop parsley in 2" lengths. Toast sesame
seeds in dry wok at low-medium heat until they are light tan; reserve
in tea cup or condiment saucer.

Assembling:  Slice lemon in wedges.  Separately pile ingredients on
large platter, removing slices of ginger from fish (discard slices).
Sprinkle salad with sesame seeds and toss on platter, squeezing lemon
over salad as you toss.
