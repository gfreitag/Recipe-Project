Categories: Condiments, Fruits, Mom
Yield: 1 Batch
Kumquats
Sugar
Lemon juice
Wash kumquats.  Pour boiling water over them; let cool. Will probably
see film of oil on top.  Rinse well and slice crosswise; remove seeds.

Measure fruit; add equal amount of sugar and just a dab of lemon
juice. Simmer gently on low heat until translucent, stirring
frequently. Serve with toast. (If makes enough to store, put in
sterilized jar and seal.)
