On Fridays, you can smell the distinct aroma of Rugelach on every
street corner in Israel. People anxious to buy them for the weekend
will line up at their neighborhood bakery to get them hot out of the
oven. Unfortunately, due to their small size, there never seems to be
enough of these delicious pastries to go around.

Mix yeast with 1 tsp. sugar and 1/2 cup of lukewarm milk (or water),
until yeast starts bubbling. Mix in rest of ingredients and knead
until dough doesn't stick to pan. Cool in refrigerator for at least 2
hours.

Roll dough into a flat sheet. Spread jam on dough and spread sugar,
cocoa mixture on top. Cut into triangles and roll starting from the
base of the triangle. On a cookie sheet, bake at medium heat (375_ )
until golden (25-35 minutes). Makes approximately 40.
