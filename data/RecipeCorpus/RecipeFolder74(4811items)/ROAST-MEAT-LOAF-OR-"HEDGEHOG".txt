Title: ROAST MEAT LOAF OR "HEDGEHOG"
Categories: Tvfn
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Mushrooms, sliced
Butter
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
Grated nutmeg
8 oz Chicken livers
1 lb Each ground beef, ground
Pork, ground veal
1 lb Sausage meat
1 lg Onion, grated
3    Fat cloves garlic, crushed
To a paste
10    Juniper berries, crushed
1 ts Ground allspice
Fresh thyme sprigs
1    To 2 eggs
8 oz Unsmoked bacon
Bay leaves
Branches of fresh rosemary
Saute the mushrooms in butter until the juices run, then season with
salt and pepper and nutmeg. Reserve. Remove the sinews from the
livers and slice. In a large bowl combine all the ground meats,
sausage, livers, onion, garlic, and juniper berries. Add the allspice
and thyme leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Beat the eggs and add
to the mixture together with the mushrooms. Mix with your hands
thoroughly.

Oil a roasting pan and place all the mixture in it, molding it into
an oval shape. Adorn with the bacon slices, criss-crossed, tucking
the ends under the meat. Strew some bay leaves and branches of
rosemary on the top and sides. Cook in a preheated oven at 450
degrees for 15 minutes, then lower the heat to 350 degrees and cook
for 1 1/2 hours.

When cooked, there will be lots of lovely juices in the bottom of the
pan. Save them to flavor soup, stocks, or eggs. Remove the loaf and
place on a serving dish. Serve hot or cold with a tomato sauce.

For children, you might like to turn it into a hedgehog by pressing
almonds into the meat to create prickles and placing 3 olives to form
eyes and a nose. This should be done before the meat goes into the
oven.
