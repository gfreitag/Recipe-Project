Categories: Appetizers, Italian, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 Servings
Polenta, cooked as above
Olive oil
1 md Head radicchio
1/4 c  Olive oil
Salt & pepper
Vinegar, optional
Preheat a broiler or fire up a grill.  Cut the cooled polenta into 1
1/2" X 3" rectangles & brush lightly with olive oil. To grill, cook
the polenta until it is lightly crispy & marked with the
characteristic brown stripes on both sides.  To broil, set thepolenta
on a broiler pan about 4" from the heat & broil, turning once, until
the slices are golden & slightly crisp at the edges. Remove & set on
a platter. While the polenta is broiling, discard any bruised outside
leaves of the radicchio, cut it in half lengthwise & then cut into
quarters. Wash & dry each piece carefully. Drizzle half the olive oil
over the radicchio & season with salt & pepper. Set on an oiled
broiler or on the barbecue. As the radicchio begins to soften &
darken in colour, turn it to broil evenly. Using your fingers or a
knife, tear or cut the grilled radicchio into small pieces. Arrange
over the polenta & drizzle with the rest of the olive oil & vinegar
if you desire.  Taste for salt.  Add freshly ground pepper & serve
hot or at rom temperature.
