Stephen Ceideburg
1 c  Butter, softened
1 bn Chopped fresh cilantro,
-stems removed
2 ts Minced fresh ginger
2 ts Minced garlic
4    Limes, divided
2    Red bell peppers, julienned
36    Black tiger prawns, peeled
-and deveined
1/2 c  Dry white wine, optional
Salt and pepper, to taste
3 c  Fresh spinach, julienned
In the bowl of a food processor, combine butter, cilantro, ginger and
garlic. Process until smooth. Add the juice of 3 limes and mix well.

Saute bell peppers and prawns in the cilantro-butter mixture over
medium heat. The wine may be added at this point. (It helps keep the
butter from scorching and makes a smoother sauce.) Cook until prawns
are pink and just barely done. Season with salt and pepper.

Serve on 1/2 cup of julienned spinach for each serving, drizzling the
butter over the top to wilt the spinach. Garnish with lime wedges.

From Silverwater Cafe, Port Townsend Wash.
