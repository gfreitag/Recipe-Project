Title: ROTEL & HOMINY TORTILLAS
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 2 Servings
1/2    - 1 can (10 oz) diced Rotel
-tomatoes, with liquid
1 cn (14 oz) hominy, drained
-well
1 cn (14 oz) black beans, rinsed
-and drained
-Optional: 6 tortillas (I
-prefer corn)
Dump Rotel tomatoes with most of the liquid into a large frying pan,
add hominy, and cook until hominy has aborbed most of the liquid,
anywhere from 10-30 minutes, depending on how runny you want it. (The
longer you cook it, the spicer the hominy tastes). Add rinsed beans,
and heat thoroughly. Serve in warmed tortillas. (One quick way to
warm a single tortilla is to spritz it with water, then microwave for
15-20 seconds).
