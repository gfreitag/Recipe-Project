Title: RAAN (ROAST LEG OF LAMB~ KASHMIRI STYLE)
Categories: Lamb, Indian
5 lb leg of lamb
Yield: 8 Servings
3    cloves garlic -- mashed,
AND
:
1    piece fresh ginger, size of
walnut -- minced
:
1 ts salt
1 ts turmeric
1/2 ts ground cinnamon
1/2 ts ground cardamom
1/2 ts cayenne
1/4 ts ground cloves
1/2 ts saffron threads
3/4 c  yoghurt
2 TB blanched almonds
2 TB blanched pistachios
1 TB honey

1.  Trim all fat from lamb, and, using a sharp knife, make slits all
over the leg. 2. Combine the garlic/ginger paste and the salt with
the cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamom, cayenne, cloves, and lemon
juice to make a paste.  If paste seems too thick, add more lemon
juice. Spread the paste over the meat, forcing into each slit. 3.
Soak the saffron threads in hot water for five minutes. 4. In a
blender or food processor put the yoghurt, the blanched nuts and the
saffron threads with their water, and puree. Coat the lamb with the
puree. Drizzle honey over the meat. 5. It is best to marinate the
meat for two days in the refrigerator, or at least overnight. Cover
loosely. 6. Preheat oven to 450 F and roast lamb in a covered baking
dish (use foil wrap if necessary) for 1/2 hour. Reduce heat to 325 F
and cook at 25 minutes to the pound, about 1-1/2hours, until meat is
tender.
