Title: QUICK ONION TARKA
Categories: Spices
Yield: 1 Servings
8 tb Cooking Oil
6 oz Dried Onion Flakes
Onion Tarka is the traditional crispy brown onion garnish sprinkled
over many Indian dishes. This is a quick version that will keep in an
airtight container for several weeks.

1. Heat the oil, then add the onion flakes. 2. Briskly stir-fry for
about 1 minute. They will burn easily so keep them moving. 3. Remove
from heat and drain. Serve hot or cold.
