Recipe by: The Frugal Gourmet On Our Immigrant Ancestors Place the
chicken pieces in a stove-top covered casserole and add the 2 cups of
water. Bring to a boil. Soak the mushrooms and drain them through a
fine strainer, reserving the soaking water. Chop the mushrooms. Add
the celery, carrot, parsley, mushrooms, along with the strained
soaking water. Add a bit of salt and pepper to taste and simmer the
whole, covered, for about 1 hr. Remove the chicken to a heated
platter and thicken the pan liquid with the roux. Add the wine and
bring the sauce to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat. Place the
egg yolks in a 2-cup glass measuring cup and add about 1/2 cup of the
sauce, stirring all the time. Blend this mixture into the sauce in
the pot, then return the chicken to the pot. Test for salt and
pepper. Heat the dish to serving temperature but not to a simmer or
the eggs will curdle.
