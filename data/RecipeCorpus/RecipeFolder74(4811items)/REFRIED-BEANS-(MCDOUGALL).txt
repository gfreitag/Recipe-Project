Cook pintos, covered, about 2 hours on low heat, until soft. Drain off
water (save for soup stock or gravy)and mash with a potato masher.

Heat small amount of pinto water in large saucepan. Add onions and
garlic and cook over low heat, about 10 minutes. Add mashed beans and
seasonings. Mix well and cook over low heat, about 20 minutes. Serve
on chapatis, tortillas, or pita bread, or with brown rice.
