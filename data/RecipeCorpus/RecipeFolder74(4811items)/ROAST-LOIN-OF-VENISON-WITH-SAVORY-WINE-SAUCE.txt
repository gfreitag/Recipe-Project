Categories: Game, Canadian, Jw
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Carrot; finely chopped
1/2 c  Celery; finely chopped
1/2 c  Onion; finely chopped
4 cl Garlic; minced
2    Sprigs fresh thyme
2    Bay leaves
3 lb Loin of venison, with bone
2 tb Clarified butter
Salt to taste
Fresh ground black pepper
Savory Wine Sauce:
3 c  Beef stock
2 tb Butter
Reserved venison bones
1/4 c  Minced shallots
1 cl Garlic; minced
1    Sprig thyme
2    Tomatoes; coarsely chopped
3 tb Sherry wine vinegar
1/4 c  Port
2 tb Red currant jelly
Salt to taste
Fresh ground black pepper
Make a marinade of the first 7 ingredients. Bone the loin; trim and
discard fat and sinew. With a cleaver chop the bone into 1" pieces
and reserve for the sauce. Slice loin against the grain into 6
pieces. Arrange in a single layer in a casserole dish. Pour over the
marinade, cover and refrigerate 24 hours. Meanwhile prepare the
sauce. Bring stock to a boil, reduce heat and cook uncovered until
volume reduced by 1/2. Set aside. Melt butter in a large, heavy
saucepan over high heat. Add bones; brown quickly, stirring often.
Add shallots, garlic and thyme, cooking until soft and lightly
colored. Add tomato; cook several more minutes. Add wines and
vinegar, bring to a boil and reduce by half. Add stock and currant
jelly. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 1 hour, skimming as
necessary. Remove from heat, strain and return to clean pan. Salt and
pepper. Refrigerate until needed and reheat before serving. To cook
the venison, remove from marinade, pat dry, and season with salt and
pepper. Sautee in clarified butter, searing all sides quickly.
Transfer pan to preheated 400 deg oven for 5-7 minutes until medium
rare. Slice each piece against the grain into 3-4 pieces and serve
with the reheated sauce.
