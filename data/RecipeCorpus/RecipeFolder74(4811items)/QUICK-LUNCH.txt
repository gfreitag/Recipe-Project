Title: QUICK LUNCH: ZUCHINI & CORN CURRY
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
4    8 small zucchini in 1/2 inch
sl (leave peel on)
1/4    To 1/2 pound frozen corn
Kernels (1/4*1/2 bag)
x  Curry powder of your choice
(I use 1-2*teaspoons)
x  Salt (optional)
Fill a microwave container with the zucchini. Top of with corn. There
should be more zucchini than corn. Generously sprinkle with curry
powder. Add some salt, if you like. Before cooking, mix thoroughly.
Microwave on high for about 8 minutes.

Serve with fresh bread or over rice; or make enough be a whole meal,
which is what I did today. Back to eating!
