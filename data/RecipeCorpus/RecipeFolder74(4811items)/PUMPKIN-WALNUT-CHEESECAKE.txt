Title: PUMPKIN WALNUT CHEESECAKE
Categories: Desserts, Cakes, Pies, Cheesecakes
Yield: 12 Servings
6 oz Zwieback crackers, crushed
1 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Brown sugar
6 tb Butter, melted
24 oz Cream cheese, softened
5    Eggs
16 oz Pumpkin
1 3/4 ts Pumpkin pie spice
1/4 c  Heavy cream
Topping:
6 tb Butter, softened
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Walnuts, coarsely chopped
Blend zwieback crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and the 6 tablespoons melted
butter. Press firmly over bottom and up sides of a lightly buttered
9-inch spring-form pan. Chill. Beat the cream cheese until smooth.
Add the 3/4 cup sugar and the 3/4 cup brown sugar, beating until well
mixed. Beat in the eggs one at a time, until mixture is light and
fluffy. Beat in the pumpkin pie spice and the heavy cream at low
speed. Mix in the pumpkin. Pour into prepared pan. Bake in a slow
oven (325) for one hour and 35 minutes. While pie is baking, mix the
topping ingredients (the last 3 ingredients), first the butter and
brown sugar until crumbly, then blending in the nuts. After the one
hour and 35 minutes, remove the pie from the oven. Spread the topping
over it, and return it to the oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven
and cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate for several hours, or overnight.
This cheesecake is rather large, and incredibly rich. Everyone always
wants more than they can fit in their stomach! And the recipe!
:-) Serving suggestion: Some like this garnished with whipped cream
and more walnuts, or with whipped cream and pecans.
