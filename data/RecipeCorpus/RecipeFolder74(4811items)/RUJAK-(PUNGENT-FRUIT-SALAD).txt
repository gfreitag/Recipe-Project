Title: RUJAK (PUNGENT FRUIT SALAD)
Categories: Sumatra, Salads, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Cucumber, peeled
1 c  Jicama, julienned
1 c  Firm, ripe papaya in 1/2
-inch cubes
1 c  Ripe pineapple in 1/2 inch
-cubes, fresh or canned
1    Firm, tart apple, cut in
-1/2-inch cubes
1    Almost ripe mango, peeled,
-cubed
3 tb Dry-roasted peanuts
1    Or 2 fresh, hot red chiles,
-seeded, sliced
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1 tb Tamarind paste dissolved in
-1/2 cup water, strained
Buried way down in my stack of papers I found an article from the SF
Chron entitled "Sumatran Food++Hotter than Hot". Sumatra is close to
Indonesia and the Malay peninsula and there seems to be some
similarity between the cuisines.

Cut the cucumber in half lengthwise, scoop out and discard the seeds.
Cut the halves in 1/4-inch thick half moons. Mix the cucumber with
jicama and fruit.

Prepare a sauce in a processor; first process the peanuts to a crunchy
consistency, then add the chiles, sugar and tamarind liquid. The sauce
should have texture so don' over process. Toss the sauce and fruit
together.

Serve chilled or at room temperature as a snack, or with an
assortment of Sumatra dishes.

Serves 6.
