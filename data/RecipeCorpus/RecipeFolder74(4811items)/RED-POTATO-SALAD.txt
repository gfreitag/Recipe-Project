Title: RED POTATO SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Red potatos, quartered,
( about six cups)
8 oz Shredded cheddar cheese
(I use half this amount to
Reduce fat and calories)
1 1/2 c  Sliced celery
1 c  Red pepper, cut into 1 inch
Chunks.
1/2 c  Green onions, sliced
3/4 c  Bottled Italian salad
Dressing (I use reduced
Or non-fat)
In a large saucepan, place potatoes with enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil; reduce heat and cook until tender, about 10 minutes.
Drain potatoes; cool to room temperature.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine cheese, celery, red pepper and
green onions; stir in potatoes.  Toss with salad dressing to coat.
Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. (I
like mine cold).
