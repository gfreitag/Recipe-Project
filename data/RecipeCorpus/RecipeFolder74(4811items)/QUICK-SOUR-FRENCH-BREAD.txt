This turns out GREAT in the breadmachine or baked in a conventional
oven. To bake in conventional oven, preheat to 400 degrees. Form
loaves and let rise a second time. Slash the loaves 5 or 6 times with
a sharp knife and brush with cold water. Bake in preheated 400 degree
over for 15 minutes and then lower the temperature to 350 degrees and
bake for 5 to 10 minutes or until golden brown and bread sounds
hollow when tapped. This bread turns crispy on the outside and moist
with a sourdough texture on the inside. Med. for 1-1/2 lb. loaf.
