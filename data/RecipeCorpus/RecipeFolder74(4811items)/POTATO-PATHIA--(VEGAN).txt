ABBREVIATIONS: cl = clove
tb = tablespoon Mix the curry powder with just enough
water to form a stiff paste. Set aside while you do the onions...

Put the onion in a large pan (NOT non-stick!) with about 1/2 inch of
stock. Cover, bring to the boil and boil, covered, for 5 minutes,
stirring occasionally and adding a little more stock if needed.

Remove the lid and boil off the liquid, stirring constantly. Let the
bottom of the pan go quite brown then pour in a splash of stock or
water and stir and scrape up the brown residue. Boil off the liquid
again and repeat, about 3 or 4 times in all until the onions are
browned and toasty-smelling. Don't EVER let it go BLACK though!

Now you have browned your onions nicely, add the garlic, ginger and a
little more liquid if necessary; and stir and cook for 30 seconds.
Stir in the curry powder mixture, and more liquid if necessary; cook,
stirring, for 5 minutes to get the rawness out of the spices. Don't
let it get too dry.

Add everything else; bring to the boil, cover and simmer for about 15
minutes, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are done to your
liking. Adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper if required.
