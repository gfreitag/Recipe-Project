Title: ROAST DUCK STUFFED WITH APPLES & GRAPES
Categories: Wild game, Poultry, Cyberealm
Yield: 4 Servings
1 ea Duck, 5 1/2 pound, dressed
Stuffing:
Duck giblets
1/2 lb Mushrooms, coarsely chopped
4 ea Greening apples, cored and
Sliced, but not peeled
1 1/2 c  Seeded (or seedless) halved
Sweet grapes
2 c  Unblanched hazelnuts
1 ts Salt
For basting:
2 c  Apple cider
Cover the duck giblets with water in a small saucepan and simmer
gently for 1/2 hour.  Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the giblet-cooking
water. Chop the giblets for the stuffing. Mix the giblets and 1/2 cup
giblet-cooking water with the stuffing ingredients. Remove any
pinfeathers from the duck, and singe to remove any hairs. Stuff both
neck and body cavities of the bird, skewer shut, and truss.  Prick
the skin of the duck well all over with a sharp fork.  Wrap any
remaining stuffing in aluminum foil. Place the duck, breast side up,
on a rack in a large roasting pan. Place the foil-wrapped stuffing in
the pan beside the bird. Place in a hot oven, 400F, and roast for 1
hour, pricking the skin of the duck with a fork and basting every 20
minutes with cider.  Reduce oven temperature to moderate, 350F, and
continue to roast for 2 hours more, pricking the duck and basting
every 20 minutes with cider and drippings.
