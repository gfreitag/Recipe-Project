Title: RASPBERRY CURD #1
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Raspberries
1/4 c  Lemon Juice
1/4 c  Sugar -- * see note
1 c  Unsalted Butter
3    Egg Yolks
* if the berries are not sweet enough

Puree the raspberries, combine them with the lemon juice and sugar, if
needed.  Place in saucepan, simmer about 5 minutes, and strain
through a mesh sieve.

Place the strained raspberries in a blender or food processor. Melt
the butter in a saucepan until it is just bubbly. With the machine
running, slowly drizzle in the butter. Return the mixture to a
saucepan. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks.  Add 3 or 4
tablespoons of the raspberry mixture to the egg yolks and blend well.
Pour the egg yolk and raspberry mixture into the saucepan with the
rest of the raspberry mixture. Over very low heat, stir until the
mixture thickens, about 10 or 15 minutes. Cool and refrigerate.

Raspberry curd will keep up to 10 days in the refrigerator. Makes
about 1 pint.
