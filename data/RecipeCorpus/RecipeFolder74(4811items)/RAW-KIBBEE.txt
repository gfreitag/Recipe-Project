Title: RAW KIBBEE
Categories: Main dish, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Round steak or lamb
3/4 c  Fine bulgar
1/2 ts Cumin
1 ts Salt
Olive oil
Put bulgar in a bowl and cover with warm water.  The water should
cover the bulgar and be about 1 inch above the bulgar. Let soak until
water is absorbed and bulgar is soft.(about 1/2 hour)

Remove ALL fat and membranes from meat(I prefer beef) and grind twice.
Combine meat, bulgar, cumin, and salt. Mix by hand until throughly
mixed. Pat kibbee onto a platter or plate. Make a hole in middle of
kibbee and fill with olive oil.  Serve with pita bread. Serve
immediately.
