another service. Although I have not yet tried it, I have had great
success with all of her recipes.  (She and her husband own the Dairy
Hollow House Bed and Breakfast in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, and she's
the author of several outstanding cookbooks, which include fantastic
vegetarian recipes.)"

Pulse water and rose petals in processor briefly.  You don't want a
pulp, just a coarse chop, a few on-offs.  Scrape mixture into a large
(3 quart) saucepan, bring to a boil quickly, and immediately turn off
heat. Let rose petals infuse in water 15 minutes.  Strain, discarding
spent petals.

Measure out 1 3/4 cups rose infusion and replace in saucepan.  Add
sugar and lemon and bring to a high, hard boil, stirring until sugar
is dissolved and mixture has reached a boil that cannot be stirred
down. At this point, add pectin.  Return to hard boil, and let boil
at a full roll exactly one minute (time it).  Remove from heat.

Put up hot, in hot jars, checking for seal once jelly has cooled.

NOTES:  The rose petal jelly will change from pink or reddish to
brown, then back during the process.

Variations:  This basic recipe works beautifully for herb infusions.
Sweet basil jelly is divine.
