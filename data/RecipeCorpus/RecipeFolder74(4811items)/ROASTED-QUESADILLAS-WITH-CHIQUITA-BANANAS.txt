Categories: Digest, August, Ornish, Lacto
Yield: 7 Servings
12    Fat free corn or whole wheat
Flour tortillas

Or cheddar cheese
2 tb Chopped fresh cilantro or
Parsley
2    Jalapeno peppers, seeded and
Minced

Circles
A suprisingly tasty sweet and spicy combination. The creamy texture
of the bananas enhances the creaminess of the melted cheese and sets
off the spicy flavors of the cilantro and japaenos. Cut the
quesadillas into wedges and serve with hot sauce or tomato salsa.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees Place 6 tortillas on a nonstick baking
sheet. Sprinkle with cheese, cilantro, chiles, sprouts and bananas.
Cover with the remaining tortillas and press down firmly.

Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until cheese is soft and melted. Cut each
quesadilla into 6 wedges and serve with hot sauce or salsa.
