Title: RANDY'S PIZZA CRUST
Categories: Main dish, Breads, Pizza
Yield: 3 Crusts
3 c  Bread flour
2 ts Yeast
1 tb Dry milk powder
1 ts Salt
1 1/8 c  Water; warm
3 tb Yellow mustard
3 tb Sugar
3 tb Oil
Put water in the breadmaker pan.  Sprinkle yeast over top.  Sprinkle
sugar on yeast (this speeds up the proofing time).  Add oil.  Add
flour, milk powder and salt.  Add mustard.

Set breadmaker for dough and wait.

I find that the mustard makes the dough easier to handle and adds an
almost undetectable flavor to the dough. Makes great bread, too.
