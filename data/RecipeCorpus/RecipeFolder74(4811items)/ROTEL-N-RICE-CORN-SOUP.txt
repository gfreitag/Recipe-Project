Title: ROTEL-N-RICE CORN SOUP
Categories: Vegetarian, Digest
Yield: 4 Servings
1 cn (10 oz) diced Rotel
-tomatoes, with liquid
1 1/2 c  Cooked rice
1/2 pk Frozen corn
3    4 cups vegetable stock, or
-water
~---------------Optional------------------------------- ~----- 2-3
corn tortillas, cut into 2 inch strips 1/2 red pepper, seeded and cut
in strips

If using red pepper, saute at the bottom of a large soup pot, using a
little bit of the broth. Add the tomatoes, cooked rice, corn, and
stock to the pot, and heat thoroughly, about 10 minutes or so.

Just before serving, stir in tortilla strips.

(Note: I think the spiciness of the Rotel provides enough seasoning,
but a little pepper, fresh cilantro, onion, etc. might be nice as
well. Think of this recipe as a base for a spicy soup, and
experiment!).
