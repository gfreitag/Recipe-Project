1/2 c  (1 stick) unsalted butter,
-room temperature
1 c  Packed brown sugar
1 c  Granulated sugar

Be sure not to overbake these, they harden as they cool.

Cream the margarine, butter, and both sugars in a large mixer bowl
until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, milk, and vanilla and beat
until blended.

Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together and add
to the butter mixture. Stir just until blended. Stir in oats. Fold in
the chocolate and walnuts.

Refrigerate the dough covered for at least an hour (important).
Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees and grease cookie sheets.

Shape the dough into balls, using a rounded teaspoon for small
cookies or a scant tablespoon for large. Flatten slightly into
rounded disks. Place 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake until the edges are slightly browned but the cookies are still
white, 8 to 10 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool on the sheets for 5 minutes. Remove
to wire racks to cool completely.
