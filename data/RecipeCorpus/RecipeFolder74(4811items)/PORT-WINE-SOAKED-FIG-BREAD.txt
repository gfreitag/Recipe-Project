1 c  Plain yogurt

Soak the figs in the port for at least one hour or more. When the
figs have absorbed a good deal of the liquid, add whatever port is
left to the bread pan.
Reserve figs for later.

Add rest of the ingredients to the pan, and bake according to
manufacturer's instructions.  Add the figs during the raisin-bread
cycle or five minutes before the final kneading is finished. Makes
1-1/2 lb. loaf.
