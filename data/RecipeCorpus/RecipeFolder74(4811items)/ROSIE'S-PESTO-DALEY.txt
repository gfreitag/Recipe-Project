Title: ROSIE'S PESTO-DALEY
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Basil leaves -- fresh
2    Garlic cloves -- peeled
(may be up to 5 cloves)  *
1/4 c  Pine nuts
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese -- fresh
Grate
1/4 c  Lemon juice -- fresh
Squeezed
Put the basil, garlic, pine nuts, and parmesan cheese in a blender or
food processor. Turn the machine on and drizzle in the lemon juice.
Continue to puree until a smooth paste isformed.

* The amount of garlic you use is a matter of personal taste. Also,
some garlic is more pungent.  So start perhaps with 2 medium cloves,
then taste, and add more if, as I do, you like a strong, garlicky
flavor.
