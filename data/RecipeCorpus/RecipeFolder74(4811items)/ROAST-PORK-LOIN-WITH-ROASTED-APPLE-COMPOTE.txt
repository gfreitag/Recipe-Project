Place oven rack on second level from bottom.  Heat oven to 500
degrees F. Place loin in a 14-by-12-by-2-inch roasting pan. Rub salt
all over loin. Smear with 1 tablespoon of the mustard over top of
loin. Roast for 20 minutes.  Move loin around with wooden spatula so
it won't stick. Roast 15 minutes more. Toss the lemon juice-coated
apples with the oil, then add the apples, juices and all, to the
roasting pan, spreading them out all around the loin.  Roast 10
minutes. Turn apples gently as they will be soft. Roast 10 minutes
more. In total, the loin should roast 55 minutes or until meat is
done. (160 degrees on an internal meat thermometer) The meat may
still be slightly pink, but this is fine. Don't overcook. Remove loin
to a platter.  Snip off strings  If using cream and optional mustard,
combine and stir the mixture carefully into apples. Let meat rest 10
~15 minutes before slicing.  Place apples around roast.
