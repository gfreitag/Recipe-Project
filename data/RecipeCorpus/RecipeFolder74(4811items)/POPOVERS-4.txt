Title: POPOVERS 4
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-========
Ingredients:

1 cup    milk 2 eggs 1 cup flour 3/4 tsp salt 1 tblsp butter or oil
Mix ingredients together, put in cupcake cups, popover pan, or pryex
cups bake at 375 degrees F for for 40-45min.

This recipe suggests that after 40mins, removing the popovers form the
oven, cut a slit in each one to let the steam out the returning them
too the oven for 10min or until tops are very firm and crisp brown.

However, I prefer to have them on the softer side.
