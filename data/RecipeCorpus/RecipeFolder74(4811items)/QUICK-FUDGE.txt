Categories: Candies, Christmas
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Box confectioner's sugar
6 tb Butter or margarine
1/4 c  Milk
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
1/4    To 1/2 cup cocoa, depending
-on how rich you want it
My mom has been making fudge for years from a recipe she found on the
side of a box of Domino's Powdered Sugar. The last time I found
Domino's sugar, they weren't putting this recipe on the side of the
box any more, so I'll go ahead and post it. Warning: it's fattening,
very rich, but you can make it in less than a half hour and without
all the beating and stirring that fudge normally takes.

QUICK FUDGE

Melt butter in bottom of large saucepan. Stir in confectioner's sugar,
followed by all other ingredients. Keep stirring until mixture comes
to a full boil. Pour mixture into an 8-inch square buttered pan. Let
cool, cut into small squares.
