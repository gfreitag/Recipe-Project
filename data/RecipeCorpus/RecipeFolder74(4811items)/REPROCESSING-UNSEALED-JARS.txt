Title: REPROCESSING UNSEALED JARS
Categories: Canning, Information
Yield: 1 Guide  If a lid fails to seal on a jar, remove the lid and check the
jar-sealing surface for tiny nicks. If necessary, change the jar, add
a new, properly prepared lid, and reprocess within 24 hours using the
same processing time. Headspace in unsealed jars may be adjusted to
1-1/2 inches and jars could be frozen instead of reprocessed. Foods
in single unsealed jars could be stored in the refrigerator and
consumed within several days.
