Categories: Ethnic, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2    Recipe Danish Pastry
cheese filling or prune filling

Roll out  Danish pastry 1/8 inch thick.  Cut into 4 inch squares. Put
a teaspoon of cheese or prune filling in center of each square.

Fold 2 opposite corners of dough over filling, overlapping them
slightly. Pinch together so they won't open during baking.

Place chilled pastries well apart on baking sheets. Brush all over
with egg yolk mixed with cream.  Place in preheated oven. Bake small
pastries for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 375 degrees.  Continue to
bake 10 to 15 minutes, or until pastries are golden brown.
Immediately upon taking pastries from oven, brush with hot apricot
glaze, then, if desired, brush very lightly with rum fondant.

Apricot Glaze:

1 cup sieved apricot jam 2 to 4 Tbsp. cognac, kirsch, applejack, or
any liqueur (optional)

Heat Apricot jam in a saucepan until it is boiling. Stir in preferred
flavoring.  Use glaze while it is hot.
