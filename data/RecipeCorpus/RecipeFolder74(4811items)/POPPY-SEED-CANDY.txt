Title: POPPY-SEED CANDY
Categories: Jewish, Candies
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Poppy seeds
2 c  Honey
1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  Chopped nuts
1/2 ts Powdered ginger
Have the poppy seeds ground for you when you buy them. If this is not
possible, grind them in a food chopper or pound with a mortar and
pestle.

Cook together the honey and sugar until syrupy. Stir in the poppy
seeds and cook until the mixture is thick, about 20 minutes. Stir
frequently. (Drop a little on a wet surface; if it doesn't run, it is
thick enough.) Stir in the nuts and ginger.

Moisten hands; pat out mixture onot wet board to thickness of about
1/2 inch.  Let cool 5 minutes, then cut into diamonds or squares with
a sharp knife.  When knife sticks, dip into hot water. Cool
completely and lift from board with a spatula.
