Title: RICE PULAO WITH CARROTS & GREEN PEAS
Categories: Indian, Grains, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
6 tb Vegetable oil
1 md Onion, thinly sliced
1    Garlic clove, chopped
10    Whole cloves
1    Cinnamon stick
10    Cardamom pods
2    Bay leaves
1/4 ts Turmeric powder (opt)
1 1/2 c  Basmati rice
3 c  Hot water
1 ts Salt
1 c  Frozen mixed peas & carrots
1/2 c  Golden raisins
1/4 c  Almonds or cashews
Heat the oil in a large pot. Saute the onion until soft, and add the
chopped garlic. The "splutter fry" the cloves, cinnamon cardamom, bay
leaves and turmeric powder for 30 seconds to 1 minutes. Lower the
heat and add the rice. Continue to fry and stir until the rice is
well coated with the spices and starts to become transparent. Add hot
water (exactly double the measure of basmati rice), add salt and
cover the pan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat. Stir in peas and
rice and cover. Check the rice every 5 minutes or so to see whether
the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Taste a grain and
see. When the rice is done, fry the raisins and almonds in a little
oil and mix into the rice. Do not overcook the rice - it will get
sticky.
