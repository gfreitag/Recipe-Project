Title: PUMPKIN ICE CREAM
Categories: Ice cream
Yield: 1 Quart
5 1/3 oz Evaporated milk
2    Eggs; separated
1/2 c  Light brown sugar
1/4 ts Ginger; powdered
1/2 ts Cinnamon; powdered
1/4 ts Nutmeg; powdered
1 c  Pumpkin puree
1/8 ts Salt
1/8 ts Cream of tartar
Use either canned pumpkin puree or make your own fresh puree:

To cook fresh pumpkin: Select a medium-sized eating pumpkin (not the
jack o' lantern variety which is too stringy). This pumpkin is almost
white and looks like a big squash. Slice pumpkin in half and scoop
out the inner pulp and seeds. Place halved pumpkin in large roasting
pan with cut side down. Since water is given off as the pumpkin cooks
the pan must have a depth of at least 1 inch. If one pan is not big
enough for pumpkin halves to lie flat, use two. Bake at 350 degrees F
about 1 hour or until the pumpkin is tender and pierces easily with a
fork. Turn pumpkin halves over and allow to cool. When pumpkin has
cooled, scrape the pulp away from the skin and puree in blender or
put through a food mill. Pumpkin puree may be frozen for later use in
a tightly covered container. It will keep about six months.

To make ice cream: Combine evaporated milk, egg yolks, brown sugar,
and spices in top of double boiler. Using a wire whisk beat the
ingredients until smooth. Place top over simmering water and cook
until custard thickens, stirring constantly.

Remove from heat. Stir in 1 cup pumpkin puree. Set aside.

In medium-sized bowl beat egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar until
stiff peaks are formed. Fold beaten egg whites into pumpkin custard.
Scrape into freezer container or serving dish, cover tightly, and
freeze until firm (about 3 hours).

Serve directly from freezer (doesn't have to ripen in refrigerator
first).

This ice cream is best if eaten within 1 week.
