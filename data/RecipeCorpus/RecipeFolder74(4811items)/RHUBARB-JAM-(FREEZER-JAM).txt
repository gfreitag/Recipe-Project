Title: RHUBARB JAM (FREEZER JAM)
Categories: Jelly/jam, Kooknet, Cyberealm
Yield: 3 Pints
4 c  Sugar
5 c  Rhubarb, cut fine
1 pk Strawberry jello (6 oz)
Stir rhubarb and sugar together and let stand overnight. Then boil
10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from stove and add strawberry jello and
stir till dissolved.  Fill jars, leaving room for expansion. Cool and
put in freezer. Delicious.

Note:  There was no indication in the recipe to tell how much this
will make ie quarts/pints etc. Comparing this recipe leads me to
estimate it will make approx 3 pints, maybe more.
