Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
3    Garlic cloves; peeled & chop
1    Dried rosemary leaves
2 1/2 lb Frying chicken; washed & dri
Salt; to taste
Freshly ground pepper
1/4 c  Vegetable oil; or olive oil
Recipe by: The Classic Italian Cookbook by Marcella Hazan Preheat
oven to 375F

Put all the garlic and half the rosemary into the bird's cavity. Add a
large pinch of salt and a few grindings of pepper.

Rub about half the oil over the outside of the chicken, and sprinkle
with salt, some more pepper, and the rest of the rosemary.

Put the chicken and the rest of oil in a roasting pan and place it in
the middle level of the preheated oven. Turn the chicken and baste it
with the fat and cooking juices every 15 minutes. Cook for about 1
hour, or until the skin is well browned and crisp.

Transfer the chicken to a warm platter.  Tip the pan and draw off all
but 1 tbsp of fat with a spoon. Place the pan over the stove burner,
turn on the heat to high, add 1 to 2 tbsp of water, and while it
boils away scrape up all the cooking residue.  Pour over the chicken
and serve.

Now that you read all of that, let me tell you how I improvised.
Basically, I used a cut up chicken and did it on top of the stove
covered, rather than roasted . Sauteing the chicken until browned and
then cooking covered until done.

Some good bread for soaking up the sauces, salad, and you're there
