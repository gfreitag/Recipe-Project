Title: RAW APPLE COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Butter or margarine*
1 1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
6    Eggs (large)
1 tb Vanilla
4 c  Peeled, diced apples**
1 c  Raisins or chopped walnuts
2 ts Baking soda
1 tb Cinnamon
1 ts Ground ginger
1 ts Ground cloves
6 c  All purpose flour +/- 1 cup
NOTE: This recipe is for a DOUBLE BATCH. These cookies are so good one
batch is never enough so I always make a double batch.

* Be sure to use regular margarine and not a spread. ** Any kind of
apples can be used.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray cookie sheets with PAM or Baker's
Secret or lightly grease. Cream butter or margarine and sugars. Add
eggs, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla. Stir in baking
soda, cinnamon, ground ginger and cloves. Stir in apples, nuts and
raisins (if desired). Add the flour and mix well.

I start with 6 cups of flour and according to the humidity level that
day, I add up to an additional cup of flour. Drop by teaspoonful onto
lightly greased cookie sheets. Bake at 350 degrees for 10-12 minutes
or until lightly browned.
