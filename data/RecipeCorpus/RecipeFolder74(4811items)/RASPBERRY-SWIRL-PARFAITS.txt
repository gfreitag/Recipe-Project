Title: RASPBERRY SWIRL PARFAITS
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lg Eggs
2 1/2 tb Sugar
2 1/2 tb Honey
3/4 c  Well-chilled heavy cream
1/2 c  Walnuts, toasted lightly,
-cooled, and chopped
6    Chocolate curls, if desired
two 10 ounce pkgs. frozen raspberries in light syrup, thawed fresh
raspberries if available for garnish

In a food processor puree the thawed raspberries, with the syrup,
force the mixture through a fine sieve into a heavy saucepan,
pressing hard on the solids, and boil the raspberry puree, stirring
occasionally, until it is reduced to about 1 cup.  Let cool and chill.

In a metal bowl beat together the eggs, the sugar, and the honey, set
the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, and beat the mixture
until it is pale, thickened, and registers 160 F on a candy
thermometer. Beat the mixture set over a larger bowl of ice and cold
water until it is cold, in another bowl beat the cream until it just
holds stiff peaks, and fold the cream and the walnuts into the egg
mixture gently but thoroughly. Spoon the raspberry puree and the egg
mixture decoratively into 6 ounce glasses, make swirls with a wooden
skewer, and freeze the parfaits, covered, overnight. The parfaits may
be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and frozen. Let the
parfaits stand for 15 minutes before serving. Arrange the chocolate
curls and the fresh raspberries decoratively on the parfaits. Serves 6
