Title: RICE & SAUSAGE STUFFING
Categories: Poultry, Dressings
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/2 c  Pearl rice
3 c  Chicken broth
1 ts Rubbed sage
1 ts Thyme leaves
1/2 ts Dry rosemary
1 1/2 lb Mild Italian sausage, casing
Removed, meat crumbled
1/2 c  Raisins
3/4 lb Mustard greens, chopped
1 c  Grated Parmesan Cheese
Conbine rice, broth, sage, thyme and rosemary and cover and bring to a
boil, then reduce heat and cook, without stirring, until liquid is
absorbed, about 15 minutes. Cook sausage on medium heat, stirring
occasionally, until lightly browned. Add the raisins to the meat,
stirring often, until they puff, then remove the meat and raisins
with a slotted spoon and add to the rice. Add the greens to the
sausage drippings and cook, stirring often until the leaves are
wilted and bright green, about 8 minutes. Add the greens, drippings
and Parmesan cheese to the rice and mix. This can be prepared the
night before and kept chilled prior to stuffing a 10-12 pound bird.
