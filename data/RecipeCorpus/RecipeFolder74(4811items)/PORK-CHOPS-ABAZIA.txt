Dry the chops with paper towels.  Season with salt and pepper. In a
large heavy skillet heat 3 T of olive oil until it is almost smoking.
Brown the chops for 2 or 3 minutes on each side and remove them to a
plate. Pour out all but 2 T of the fat. Lower the heat.  Add the
shallots and garlic and cook until soft.  Make sure not to burn them.
Add the paprika, tomatoes and wine. Bring the mixture to a boil and
lower the heat. Add the hot chili pepper, tomato paste, green pepper
and rosemary. Return the chops to the pan.  Cover it tightly and let
them simmer for 45 minutes. Five minutes before they are ready, add
the roasted red peppers. Remove the chops to a serving dish. If the
sauce seems a little thin, raise the heat and reduce it until it
heavily coats the spoon. Discard the rosemary. Correct the seasoning
and pour the sauce over the chops. Garnish with parsley and serve
immediately. Note: This dish can be cooked in a 350 degree oven for
45 to 50 minutes and can be served over rice pilaf.
