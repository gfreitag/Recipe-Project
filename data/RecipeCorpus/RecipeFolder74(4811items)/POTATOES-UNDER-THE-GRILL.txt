Title: POTATOES UNDER THE GRILL
Categories: Side dish, Vegan, Barbecue
Yield: 2 Servings
4 md Potatoes; peeled
40 g  Unsalted butter*
1    Garlic clove
Sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
*(Vegans use vegan margarine or oil instead of butter)

A lightly grilled circle of thinly sliced potatoes is simply
flavoured with garlic and passed under the grill with a little butter
on top. A lovely supper dish served with a tossed salad.

Slice the raw potatoes as thinly as possible and, using a biscuit
cutter, cut out circles.

In a heavy pan heat enough butter, about 25 g (1 oz), to cover the
bottom. SautÂ‚ the potato circles on both sides, one layer at a time,
until they are just cooked.

Butter a small ovenproof dish, and rub the bottom with a cut clove of
garlic. Melt the remaining butter. Make layers of overlapping potato
circles, brushing them with melted butter and seasoning with salt and
pepper. Then brush with the melted butter. Place under the grill for
about I minute or until they are golden brown.
