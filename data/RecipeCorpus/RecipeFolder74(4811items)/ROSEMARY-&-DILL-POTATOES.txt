Title: ROSEMARY & DILL POTATOES
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Potatoes
1 oz Rosemary sprigs
1 oz Dill
1/4 c  Good extra virgin olive oil
Salt to taste
Cut the potatoes into 1 inch cubes and chop the dill. Baste a large
baking pan with a coating of olive oil. Toss the potatoes and dill
with the remaining oil and spread them out over the pan. Lay sprigs
of rosemary over the top of the potatoes covering as evenly as
possible. If the sprigs are long, break them into shorter segments so
the rosemary can be more evenly distributed. Bake in an oven at 350*F
for 30 to 45 minutes or until the potatoes are done. Remove the
rosemary and serve in a serving dish garnished with fresh rosemary
and dill sprigs around the sides.
