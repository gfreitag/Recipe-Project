Prune puree replaces most but not all of the fat as some is required
for taste and texture. Fruit juice concentrate is available at health
food stores.

Spray two baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray or line with
parchment paper. Preheat oven to 350.

In a food processor combine the pitted prunes and hot water. Process
until smooth. In a large bowl, whisk together prune puree, butter and
oil until smooth. Gradually whisk in fruit juice concentrate and
vanilla.

In another bowl, stir together flour, rolled oats, baking soda and
salt. Add the flour mixture to the prune mixture and blend. Drop by
rounded spoonfuls onto the baking sheets and bake for 12 to 15 min.
