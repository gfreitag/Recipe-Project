Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Roast beef, cut into
-1/4-inch dice
3/4 lb Potatoes, boiled until

-1/4-inch dice
2 md Onions, finely chopped
1    Green bell pepper, seeded

1/4 c  Heavy cream

In mixing bowl, stir together the roast beef, potatoes, onions,
pepper, heavy cream, parsley, salt and pepper until thoroughly
blended. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the oil
in 10- inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat. Add hash
mixture, and use spatula or back of a wooden spoon to pack it down
firmly in skillet, on top and all around its sides to make a neat,
solid cake.

keep hash from sticking, until its underside is crusty and well
browned, 8 to 10 minutes.

Unmold hash cake onto large dinner plate by inverting plate over the
skillet, holding it there firmly, and turning skillet and plate over
together.  Raise heat and add the remaining butter and oil to skillet.

Slide flipped hash cake back into pan, reduce heat and cook it for 8
to 10 minutes more.
