Title: PORK MEDALLIONS WITH MAPLE-VINEGAR SAUCE
Categories: Pork
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Pork chops; loin, boneless,
Pepper
2 T  Butter
1/4 c  Shallot; minced
2 ts Dijon mustard
1 c  Chicken broth; canned
2 T  Maple syrup
2 T  Balsamic vinegar
Approx. Cook Time:  0:30

Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, flatten the pork between sheets of
waxed paper to about quarter-inch thickness.  Season both sides of
the pork with pepper.  Melt the butter in a heavy large skillet over
medium-high heat.  Add the pork and saut√© until it is brown and
cooked through, about four minutes per side, then transfer them to a
plate. Add the shallots to the same skillet, and cook for 30 seconds.
Mix in the mustard and chicken broth and simmer until it is red uced
by one-quarter, about five minutes. Stir in the maple syrup and
vinegar. Simmer until the liquids are reduced to sauce consistency,
about five minutes longer. Return the pork and accumulated juices to
the skillet. Cook until they are just heated through, about one
minute.  Arrange the pork on a platter. Spoon sauce over and serve.
30 Minute Main Course.

Note:  The sweet-and-sour sauce complements the pork deliciously.
Mashed potatoes with chives, some green peas and a purchased apple
tart would complete the meal nicely.
