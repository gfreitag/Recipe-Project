Yield: 10 Servings
7 oz Corkscrew macaroni; uncooked
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese; grated
1/2 ts Italian seasoning
1/8 ts Garlic salt

Cook the macaroni according to package directions, drain. Rinse with
cold water, drain. Pat the moisture from the macaroni with paper
towels. Combine the cheese, seasoning and garlic salt in a small
bowl, and set aside. Heat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a deep skillet or
fryer to 365F. Fry 12 macaroni at a time in the hot oil until light

with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat until all of
the cooked macaroni are fried. While the macaroni are still warm,
sprinkle with the cheese mixture. Toss gently to coat evenly. Cool.
