Another entry in the "Build a Better Burger Contest" sponsored by the
North American Vegetarian Society.
Since entering the contest, the contestant has reworked his recipe,
eliminating the green peppers and green beans, reducing the rolled
oats to 1/2 cup, adding 1/2 cup corn meal, and replacing the seasoned
salt and vegetable broth with tamari, dijon mustard, tarragon, basil
and parsley.

The recipe was entered in the contest without the vegan yeast cheese.
