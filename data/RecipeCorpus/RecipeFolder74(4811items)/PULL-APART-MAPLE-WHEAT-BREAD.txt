Title: PULL APART MAPLE WHEAT BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/4 c  Water
3/4 c  Maple-flavored syrup
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
2 pk Dry yeast
1 ts Salt
1 ts Ground cinnamon
2    Eggs, beaten
1 c  Raisins
3 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour (3 to
-3-1/2 cups)
1 tb Butter or margarine, melted
Combine water, syrup and oil in a small saucepan; heat until very
warm (120 to 130 degrees). Set aside.

Combine all-purpose flour, yeast, salt, and cinnamon in a large mixing
bowl; stir in syrup mixture and eggs, mixing well. Stir in raisins and
enough whole wheat flour to make a soft dough.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth
and elastic (about 5 minutes). Place in a greased bowl, turning to
grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free
from drafts, 1 hour.

Punch dough down; divide into 20 pieces, and shape each piece into a
ball. Place 10 balls, in rows of 5, in each of two greased 9x5x3-inch
loaf pans. Brush each loaf with melted butter. Cover and let rise in
a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 45 minutes.

Bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes, or until loaves sound hollow when
tapped. Remove loaves from pans, and cool thoroughly on wire racks.

Yields 2 loaves.
