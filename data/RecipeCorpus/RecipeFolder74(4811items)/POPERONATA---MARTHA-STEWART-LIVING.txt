Title: POPERONATA - MARTHA STEWART LIVING
Categories: Condiments, Soup/stews
Yield: 1 Cup
3 lg Peppers, preferably 1 each
-red, yellow, and orange
1 lg Spanish onion, peeled
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Unsalted butter
1    Clove garlic, peeled and
-thinly sliced
Pinch of sugar
Salt & freshly ground pepper
1. Stem, seed, and remove ribs from peppers. Cut lengthwise into
1-inch-wide strips; leave curved ends intact. Cut onion in half
length- wise and slice into 1/4-inch-thick semicircles.

2. Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add
garlic and onions and cook for about 2 minutes. Add pepper strips and
sugar and toss for 2 to 3 minutes. Cover pan and turn heat to low.
Cook, stirring occasionally until peppers are very soft, 30 to 35
minutes.

3. Remove cover and raise heat to medium. Cook, stirring often, until
most of the liquid evaporates and peppers are nicely glazed, about 3
minutes. Add a little water, if necessary, to avoid scorching. Season
with salt and pepper. Serve peperonata warm or at room temperature.
