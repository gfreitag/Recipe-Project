Title: ROASTED RICE - THINH
Categories: Ethnic, Rice
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Rice
Roasted rice is used quite frequently in Vietnamese cooking. We
generally prepare a quantity of it and keep it in a jar to have on
hand when needed.

Heat a small, dry frying pan over high heat and add the rice. Toast,
stirring constantly, until rice is brown. Transfer to a blender and
grind into a powder. Store as suggested above.
