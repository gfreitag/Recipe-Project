Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Unsweetened chocolate square
4 tb Butter
1/3 c  Mashed potatoes
1/8 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 lb Confectioners' sugar
Cook and mash a medium potato without using any seasoning, butter or
milk. Measure 1/3 cup.  Melt chocolate and butter together. Blend
into mashed potatoes with the salt and vanilla. Mix well. Sift sugar.
Add a small amount at a time, blending until no sugar is visible.
When a spoon is no longer equal to the task of mixing, knead in the
balance of the sugar with well-buttered hands. Turn out onto a board
and continue to knead until mixture is smooth, glossy and pliable,
buttering hands as necessary. No crumbs should remain. Press into a
buttered 8-inch square pan or shape into balls and top each ball with
a nutmeat
