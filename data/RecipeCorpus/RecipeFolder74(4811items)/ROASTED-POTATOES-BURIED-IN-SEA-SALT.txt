Title: ROASTED POTATOES BURIED IN SEA SALT
Categories: Potatoes, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
12 md New potatoes
2 c  Coarse sea salt or Kosher
- salt
Try using red new potatoes or small yellow potatoes in this dish,
burying them completely in the coarse sea salt or Kosher salt. The
results -- crisp skin and soft, buttery insides -- with just the
right amount of saltiness. The salt acts as a kind of "crust" without
overwhelming the potatoes. Brush the hot salt off the potatoes using
a pastry brush or your hands well wrapped in a pot holder.

With the potatoes serve any roast.

Directions: ~--------- Preheat oven to 350 F.

Place the potatoes in a medium-size roasting pan or ovenproof
skillet; do not crowd the pan. Pour the salt over the potatoes; there
should be enough salt so that only the very tops of the potatoes peek
through.

Roast the potatoes until tender, about 45-minutes. Brush the salt off
the potatoes before serving. Serve hot.
