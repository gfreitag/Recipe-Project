Title: POTATOES ANNA
Categories: Potato, Rosemary
Yield: 8 Servings
2 ts Olive oil
2 ts Unsalted butter
3 lb New potatoes, peeled and
-thinly sliced
1/2 c  Chopped fresh Italian
-parsley (flat leaf)
1/4 c  Finely minced fresh rosemary
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper
3/4 c  Chicken broth (I use
-vegetable broth)
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees (F).

2. Lightly spray or wipe a 10-inch cast-iron skillet with vegetable
oil and place it in the oven;  heat the skillet for 20 minutes.
Carefully remove the skillet and place it on a burner over high heat.
If necessary, wipe out any burned oil with a paper towel. Heat the
olive oil and butter in the skillet and swirl in the pan to coat it
evenly. Overlap the potato slices, beginning in the center of the pan
and continuing up the sides. Working quickly, layer in all the
potatoes, seasoning with parsley, rosemary, salt, and plenty of
freshly ground pepper between the layers. Pour the broth over the
potatoes.  Lightly spray or wipe the outside and bottom of a 9-inch
cake pan with vegetable oil and place it on the potatoes. Weight the
cake pan with pie weights or beans.

3.  Return the pan to the oven and bake for 1 hour, or until the
potatoes are tender.  Run a metal spatula around the edge of the
skillet. Invert the potato cake onto a platter, cut it into eight
wedges, and serve immediately.
