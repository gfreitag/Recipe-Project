Title: RUBY CROWNS
Categories: Side dish, Jaw, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
3    Acorn squash
3/4 lb Butternut squash, diced into
1/4" cubes
1 1/2 c  Fresh cranberries
3 tb Raspberry jam
1 tb Honey
4 ts Butter
Pinch of salt
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake prepared acorn squashes for 30
minutes or until tender. Blanch butternut in boiling salted water for
2 minutes, or until tender. Drain. In another pot, blanch cranberries
until they start to pop, 2-3 minutes. Drain and combine with
butternut. Heat the jam and honey until they bubble. Add butter and
salt. Combine squash and jam mixture. Spoon into cooked acorn squash.
Bake 15 minutes. (it didn't say but I'm thinking they mean to serve
in halved acorn squash right?)
