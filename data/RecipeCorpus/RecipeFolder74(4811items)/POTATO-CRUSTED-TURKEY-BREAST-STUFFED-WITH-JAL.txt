MMMMM-----------------------REST OF RECIPE----------------------------
4    Turkey breasts (6oz)
2    Baking potaotes; peeled, cut
-in half, kept in water
1/4 c  Dijon mustard
1 tb Essence
Olive oil for sauting
2 c  Fried shoestring potatoes
-tossed with Emeril's
-Southwest seasoning
Preheat the oven to 4450 degrees. For stuffing: In a saute pan, heat
the olive oil. When the pan is smoking hot saute the onions,
shallots, and garlic for 1 minute.  Add the jalapenos, celery, and
corn. Continue sauting for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. In
a mixing bowl, combine the sauteed vegetables, crumbled corn muffins
and stock together, mix until incorporated. For the turkey: Using a
small knife, make a 2-inch slit on the side of the breast, forming a
pocket. Fill each pocket with about 1/2 cup of the stuffing.  Using a
potato threader from Suzy Wong, thread the potatoes. Season each
stuffed breast with Essence. Rub the entire breast with the Dijon
mustard.  On a cloth napkin folded in half, cover the bottom half
with the seasoned potato crust. Place the turkey in the center and
fold over ther remaining crust over the breast. Roll the breast up
tightly in the napkin.  This will help in holding the crust to the
meat. In a saute pan, heat the olive oil.  When the pan is smoking
hot, remove the napkin and add the potato crusted turkey. Saute for
2-3 minutes or until golden on one side. Flip the meat over and
finish cooking in the oven for 8-10 minutes.  Serve with shoestring
potatoes.
