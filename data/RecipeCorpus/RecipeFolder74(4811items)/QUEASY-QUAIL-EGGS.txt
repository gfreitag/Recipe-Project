Wash potatoes thoroughly incold water and place them in the large
saucepan. Place frozen broccoli in small saucepan. Cover both with
water and a pinch of salt.

Cook potatoes over high heat for approximately 15 minutes or until
tender. Cook the broccoli about 5 minutes or until tender. Carefully
drain the vegetables through a colander over the sink.

Put the broccoli in the blender and blend on medium for a few
secondsuntil it is the consistency of thick salsa.

Place the cheese spread in a small saucepan and cook on low heat,
stirring continuously, until it's completely melted.

Remove cheese from the stove and pour into a mixing bowl. Add the
broccoli and mix until the cheese is completely green.

Using a fork, spear the potatoes one at a time and dip in the cheese
mixture, covering completely. Set the potatoes on a platter, spoon
extra cheese over and serve. Serves 4-6 foul fellows.

Sicko serving suggestion: Rotten eggs are the perfect side dish to
serve with chicken or other poultry. Just ask Mom or Dad to rustle up
a dead bird and bake it!
