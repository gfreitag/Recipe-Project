Title: RUMAKI ALA YOSHIDA'S
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 24 Servings
2 lb Fresh chicken livers
2 c  Yoshida's Gourmet Sauce, *
-see note
1 lb Bacon, ** see note
2    5-oz cans whole water
-chestnuts
Marinate chicken livers in Yoshida's for 24 hours. Cut bacon slices in
half. Using toothpicks, wrap bacon around a piece of liver and a water
chestnut. Bake on rack in 350 degree oven for 30 minutes, turning
half way through, or until liver is cooked through and bacon is
crispy. If desired, broil briefly when cooked through to crisp bacon,
but be careful not to burn the bacon! (I've also done these on
low-off-low setting on a Weber gas grill with excellent results.)

NOTES : *Yoshida's Gourmet Sauce is a sweet teriyaki-style sauce. **I
prefer to use maple-flavored bacon. MC formatted 12/10/96 by
