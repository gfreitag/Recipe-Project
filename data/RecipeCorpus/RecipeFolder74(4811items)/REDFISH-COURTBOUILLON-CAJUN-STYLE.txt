Lafayette, LA. In Cajun land, this is pronounced Coo-bee-yon. NOTE-My
mother-in-law used to add a touch of Creole mustard to her sauce. It
gave it a good tangy flavor. Also she would put the filets in a
baking dish, pour the sauce over and bake in the oven, so the fish
would not fall apart. Contrary to what Chef Richard says, this dish is
customarily served with mashed potatoes in my neck of the woods.
