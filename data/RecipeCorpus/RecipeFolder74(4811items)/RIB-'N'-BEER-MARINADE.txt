1 qt Beer (Your favorite brand)
2 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Cider vinegar
1 tb Chili powder
1 ts Cumin, ground
1 ts Dry mustard

Combine beer, sugar, vinegar, spices in a large pan. Bring to a boil,
remove from heat, and cool.  Place ribs in a large shallow roasting
pan (not aluminum). Pour marinade over ribs. Turn ribs several times
while they marinate about 24 hours in refrigerator. Drain ribs,

smoked and grilled.
