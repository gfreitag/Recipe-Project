The recipe says, that this would be a good substitute for potato
latkes for Hanukkah. 1. Cook the noodles according to directions on
the package and drain. Transfer to a large bowl and add margarine,
blending well. Set aside. 2.  Saute the onion in 2 tbs vegetable oil,
until golden. Add the onions to the noodles. Add the eggs and salt
and pepper to taste. Mix all ingredients well. 3. Heat remaining 4
tbs oil in a large, heavy frying pan. Add the noodle mixture and let
brown on the bottom and sides, taking care not to burn 4. When
browned on one side, place a large plate over the pan. Turn over onto
the plate and then slide back into the pan to brown the other side.
Serves: 4-6.
