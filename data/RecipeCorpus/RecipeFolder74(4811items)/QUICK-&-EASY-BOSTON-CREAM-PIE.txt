Categories: Pies, Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
1 pk Yellow cake mix
(single layer size)
1    Egg
Water
1/2 ts Lemon extract
1 pk Vanilla pudding (regular)
1 1/2 c  Milk
1 ts Vanilla
1 cn Chocolate frosting
1.  Prepare the cake mix using the egg, water, and lemon extract,
following label directions.  Pour into a greased and floured 8-inch
round
cake pan.(9-inch is too large and causes cake to be too flat.)

2.  Bake at 350Ã¸F for time indicated on the cake package, or until the
center of the cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool cake in
pan
on rack for 10 minutes.  Remove from pan and cool completely.

3.  Prepare pudding mix with milk and vanilla and cook according to
package directions.  Cover with plastic wrap to prevent skin from
forming on top and cool completely.

4.  Split layer cake, fill with cooled vanilla pudding, put cake back
together and then frost with enough chocolate frosting to cover the
top. Store in refrigerator.
