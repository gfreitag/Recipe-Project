Title: RASPBERRY-BLACKBERRY GRATIN
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
3    Egg yolks from extra-large
-eggs
1 tb Water
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Framboise (raspberry brandy)
2 c  Heavy cream, chilled
3 c  Raspberries
3 c  Blackberries
Combine the egg yolks, water and sugar in a metal bowl set over,
but not touching, gently simmering water, or in the top pan of a
double boiler set over simmering water. Whisk constantly until the
mixture is foamy and begins to thicken slightly, 2-3 minutes.
Immediately remove from the heat and strain into a 2-quart metal
bowl. (The use of a metal bowl will help cool down the mixture more
quickly.)  Stir in the Framboise, cover and refrigerate for at least
4 hours or overnight.
Just before serving, position the rack 3-4 inches from the heat
source in a broiler and preheat the broiler.
Using chilled beaters and a large chilled bowl, whip the cream
until stiff peaks form.  Gently fold the cream into the chilled
custard. Scatter all the berries over the bottom of a 2-quart
ovenproof baking dish with at least 1-inch sides.  Place the dish on
a heavy-duty baking sheet or in a shallow baking pan to make for
easier removal from the broiler. Gently pour and spoon the custard
over the berries.
Broil (grill) until the top is browned and bubbling, 1-1/2 - 2
minutes.  Serve immediately.
