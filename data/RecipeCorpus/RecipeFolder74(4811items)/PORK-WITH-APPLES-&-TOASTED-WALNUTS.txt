Title: PORK WITH APPLES & TOASTED WALNUTS
Categories: Pork
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Walnuts -- broken
4    Pork loin chops -- each 1
Inch thick
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper
1/3 c  Apple juice
2 tb Brandy
1    Clove garlic -- minced
3/4 ts Fresh thyme -- finely
Chopped
1/2 lb Tart green apples -- cored;
Sliced 1/4"
1. In a large, heavy skillet over high heat, toast walnuts 2 to 3
minutes, stirring frequently. Remove and set aside.

2. Season chops with salt and pepper to taste. Trim a piece of fat
from the edge of one chop. In the same skillet over medium-high heat,
heat fat until lightly browned, using a spoon to press and rub fat
over bottom of skillet to grease it well. Discard fat and increase
heat to high.

3. Add chops; brown quickly on both sides. Pour excess fat, if any,
from skillet.

4. Add apple juice, brandy, garlic, thyme, and apples to pan.

5. Cover pan and cook over medium-low heat 5 to 8 minutes. To test for
doneness, cut into a chop; it should be tender, juicy, and slightly
pink. If pork is done and apples are still crunchy, remove pork to a
platter and cover with foil to keep warm. Continue to cook apples
until they are tender.

6. Stir walnuts into sauce in pan. Pour walnut-apple sauce over chops.
Serve chops immediately.
