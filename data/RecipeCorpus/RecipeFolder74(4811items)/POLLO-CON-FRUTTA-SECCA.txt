-JUDI M. PHELPS (BNVX05A)
3 1/2 lb Chicken; cut in pieces
4 lg Garlic cloves; finely minced
2 ts Dried oregano
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
1 c  Pitted prunes
1/2 c  Dried apricots
2    Bay leaves
1/2 c  Green olives; pitted/sliced
2 tb Capers
1 tb Caper juice
1/2 c  Brown sugar *
3/4 c  Chardonnay or dry white wine
In a large bowl, combine chicken, garlic, oregano, olive oil, vinegar,
prunes, apricots, bay leaves, olives, capers and caper juice. Cover
and refrigerate 24 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Arrange
chicken in a single layer in a shallow baking pan and spoon marinade
evenly over chicken.  Sprinkle with brown sugar and pour Chardonnay
around chicken. Bake 45 minutes, basting every 15-20 minutes. With a
slotted spoon, remove chicken, fruit, olives, and capers to a serving
platter. Pour several spoonfuls of pan juices over chicken. Serve
remaining pan juices in a sauce boat. Any dry white wine may be
substituted for Chardonnay.

*Use 1/4 cup brown sugar to start off with, I think 1/2 cup brown
sugar may be a bit too much. Source: Fine Wine in Food Cookbook
