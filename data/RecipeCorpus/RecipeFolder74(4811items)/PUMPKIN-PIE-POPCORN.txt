-Sue Woodward
1 c  Light brown sugar; packed
1/4 c  Light corn syrup
1/4 c  -Water

1 ts Pumpkin pie spice
8 c  Popped corn
In a heavy saucepan, combine brown sugar, corn syrup, water, butter,
and pumpkin pie spice.  Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is
dissolved. Reduce heat and gently boil, stirring occasionally, until
a candy thermometer reaches 285~ (syrup separates into hard, but not
brittle, threads when dropped into very cold water). Gradually pour
over popcorn, tossing to coat evenly. Spread out on a lightly
buttered cookie sheet. Cool and break into small pieces.
