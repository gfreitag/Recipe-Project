Melt a bit of duck fat in a very hot frying pan.  Salt and pepper the
duck breasts, and fry them until cooked rare (approx 2 minutes per
side). Remove the breasts and let cool. Now fry the onions until
golden, adding a bit more duck fat if necessary.  While the onions
are cooking, cut the duck breasts into small dice and put in a bowl.
When the onions are almost done, add the garlic, rosemary and hot
peppers, stir for about a minute, just enough to release the flavors.
Scrape into bowl with the duck and stir until well mixed. Stuff the
peppers with roughly 1/3 cheese, 2/3 duck mixture.  You can batter
and fry them, but I baked these (10 minutes at 350 -- just enough to
melt the cheese and heat them through) and sauced them with my basic
ancho/cumin red sauce. Serves 2 as a main course, or 6 as an
appetizer. [NB. These are even better if you have time to roast a
duck instead of pan frying. Coat the duck with garlic & black bean
paste, prick the skin thorouhly with a fork, and roast at 325 for 1
1/2-2 hours, or until the fat has mostly cooked off. Let cool and
shred the meat, including bits of skin. Then substitute for the diced
cooked breast meat above.]
