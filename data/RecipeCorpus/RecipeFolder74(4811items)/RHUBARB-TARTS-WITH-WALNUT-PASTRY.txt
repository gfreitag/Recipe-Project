FOR PASTRY:  Combine flour, walnuts, and sugar in medium bowl. Cut in

3 1/2 inch round tart pans. Trim edges of dough even with edge of
pan. Prick bottom with fork.  Bake until crisp and lightly browned,
about 25 minutes. Let cool.

FOR FILLING:  Combine 1/3 cup water and 1/4 cup sugar in medium
saucepan over low heat.  Add rhubarb, cover and bring to simmer,
stirring gently once or twice. Cook just until rhubarb is tender,
about 3 to 5 minutes. Drain, reserving liquid.  Taste and adjust
sweetness of the rhubarb, adding more sugar if desired. Return liquid
ro pan.

Mix 2 tablespoons water with arrowroot.  Blend into rhubarb cooking
liquid. Place over low heat and stir gently until thickened and
clear, about 5 minutes. Add rhubarb. Let cool.

Spoon filling into tart shells.  Melt jelly over very low heat. Spoon
or brush evenly over filling. Refrigerate tarts until ready to serve.
Top each with a dollop of creme fraiche or sour cream.
