Title: POTATO SUPPER ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 16 Servings
1 md Baking potato,
-peeled and cut into
-1-1/2-inch pieces
1 c  Skim milk
1 pk Dry yeast
3 3/4 c  Bread flour, divided
2 tb Sugar
3/4 ts Salt
2 tb Margarine, softened
1    Egg, lightly beaten
Vegetable cooking spray
Directions: Place potato in a small saucepan; cover with water, and
bring to a boil.

Reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes or until very tender;
drain. Press potato through a sieve into a bowl. Set aside 1/2 cup
potato, and discard remaining potato.

Heat milk over medium-high heat in a heavy saucepan to 180 deg or
until tiny bubbles form around edge. (Do not boil.) Remove from heat;
let cool until very warm (120-130 degrees).

Combine yeast, 1 cup flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl; stir
well. Add 1/2 cup potato, very warm milk, margarine, and egg; beat at
medium speed of an electric mixer until smooth. Add 1 cup flour; beat
until smooth. Stir in 1-1/4 cups flour to form a soft dough. Turn
dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until smooth
and elastic (about 10 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1
tablespoon at a time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands.

Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to
coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from
drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

Punch dough down, and turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface;
knead lightly 4 or 5 times. Divide dough in half; cut each half into
8 equal portions, shaping each piece into a ball with lightly floured
hands. (Cover remaining dough while working to prevent it from drying
out.) Place balls 3 inches apart on baking sheets coated with cooking
spray. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from
drafts, 25 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

Uncover dough. Bake at 325 degrees for 23 minutes or until lightly
browned.
