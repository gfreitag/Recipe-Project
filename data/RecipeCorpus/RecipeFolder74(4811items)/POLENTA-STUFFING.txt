Title: POLENTA STUFFING
Categories: Stuffing
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Unsalted butter; divided
2 lb Mushrooms; sliced/divided
2 md Onions; diced/divided
2 c  Water
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
1/4 ts Fresh ground black pepper
1/2 ts Dried leaf thyme
1/4 ts Coriander
Enough for an 8-pound bird.

Melt half the butter in a very large skillet.  Add half the mushrooms
and half the onions and cook over medium heat until onions are soft
and moisture from mushrooms has evaporated, about 15 minutes; set
aside in a bowl. Repeat with remaining butter, mushrooms and onions.
Pour water into a medium pan. Add salt and bring to a boil. Pour in
the cornmeal in a slow, steady stream, stirring constantly, for 15
minutes. Scrape the polenta into the mushrooms. Add the pepper, thyme
and coriander; mix well. Let cool to room temperature before stuffing
bird. Or bake stuffing in a greased, covered loaf pan in preheated
375-degree oven for
30    minutes.
