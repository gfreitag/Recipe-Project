3    Potatoes
3 tb Granulated sugar
1 pn Salt
2    Egg yolks
4 c  Finely shredded coconut
1 1/2 c  Glaceed fruit
Confectioners' sugar
(Author's note): In a Cretan zacharoplasteion (sweet shop), we were so
intrigued by these coconut pastries (among the newer breed) that I
tried them at home. You can expect the potato pastry to be a bit
difficult to manipulate, and you can also anticipate compliments on
the results. Attractive and tasty, not excessively sweet.

Boil the potatoes in their jackets until fork tender, then drain and
remove the skins and all spots. Return the potatoes to the pan and
dry over medium heat, shaking pan constantly. Push the potatoes
through a mill or ricer, then combine in a large bowl with the sugar
and salt. When somewhat cool, add the egg yolks and coconut and knead
until smooth. Refrigerate for 2 hours.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and knead until smooth enough
to roll. If sticky, dust lightly with flour. Roll out on a floured
board to 1/4-inch thickness, then, using a glass with a 3-1/2-inch
diameter, cut the pastry into rounds.

Meanwhile, mince the glaceed fruit. Place 1 tablespoon on the center
of each of the pastry rounds. Lift one side with a spatula and fold
over the other half, forming a half-circle. Press the edges together
and place on a baking sheet. Continue until all have been stuffed,
then bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 15 minutes, or until firm;
the pastries will be white. Remove and cool for 10 minutes, then roll
in confectioners' sugar and cool completely. Store in a covered
container.

Note: In Crete this pastry is cut with a serrated pastry cutter
producing an attractive edging.
