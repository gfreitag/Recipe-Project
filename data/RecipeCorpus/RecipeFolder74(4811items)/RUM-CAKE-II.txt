Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Microwave
Yield: 8 Servings
18 1/2 oz Pk devil's food cake mix
Ingredients as called for
On package label
3    Egg whites, at room temp
1/4 ts Salt
6 tb Sugar
1 c  Light corn syrup
2 tb Light corn syrup
2 ts Vanilla extract
Apricot preserves
Rum
1. Grease two 8-inch square, heat-resistant, non-metallic cake Pans.
Line bottom with wax paper cut to fit bottom of cake Pans. Set aside.
2. Prepare cake mix according to package directions. 3. Pour 1/2 of
the batter into each prepared pan. 4. Heat each layer, covered with
wax paper, in Microwave Oven 6 1/2 minutes. 5. Allow cake to cool 10
minutes before removing from pan. 6. Invert on cooling rack and
remove wax paper from bottom of cake. 7. While cakes are cooling,
prepare frosting. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites with salt
until foamy. Add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff
peaks form. 8. Pour corn syrup into a 2-cup, heat-resistant,
non-metallic measuring cup. 9. Heat corn syrup, uncovered, in
Microwave Oven 2 minutes or until corn syrup comes to a boil. 10.
Gradually pour boiling mixture over egg whites, beating constantly
until frosting is cool and very stiff. Beat in vanilla. 11. Pour rum
over the tops of both cake layers. 12. Spread apricot preserves over
one of the cooled layers. Then spread some of the frosting on it. 13.
Place second layer on top of first layer and spread entire cake with
frosting. TIPS: Frosting will be neater if you place strips of wax
paper under the bottom edges of the cake before frosting the sides.
Remember to gently remove wax paper before serving cake. Any leftover
frosting can be used on cupcakes or stored in refrigerator for later
use.
