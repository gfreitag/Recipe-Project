sugar, evaporated milk, orange peel and 2 tablespoons rum. Set aside.

To make cake batter, sift flour with 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder and
salt. Place in small bowl and make well in center. Place 2 yolks,
oil, 1 tablespoon rum and orange juice in well. Stir until blended,
starting from center. Beat egg whites with cream of tartar until
foamy. Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating until stiff but
not dry. Gently fold batter into whites.

Pour custard mixture into caramel-lined pan. Gently spoon cake batter
over flan mixture. Place pan in larger pan and pour hot (not boiling)
water into larger pan until it reaches half depth of cake pan. Bake
at 325F 50 to 60 minutes, or until cake is done. Cool on rack or
chill until ready to serve. Invert onto serving platter and pipe
whipped cream rosettes around edges of flan.
