Title: RED CURRANT RHUBARB SAUCE WITH PORT WINE
Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Rhubarb, peeled & diced 1/4"
(about 1 lb)
1 1/4 c  Red currant jelly
1 tb Arrowroot
1 tb Port wine
Thoroughly wash about 1 pound of fresh rhubarb and peel the fibrous
outer layer off with a knife.  Cut the stalks into small pieces,
about 1/4 inch dice. Combine the rhubarb with the red currant jelly
and cook over medium heat until reduced by about 1/3. Strain the
rhubarb out of the sauce. You should have about 1 cup of liquid. If
you have more, reduce over medium heat until the desired 1 cup is
reached. Save the cooked rhubarb and chill it overnight.  This can be
served just like you would applesauce with a pork chop. Combine the
port wine and arrowroot and stir out any lumps. Add the port mixture
to the boiling rhubarb sauce and stir vigorously for 1 minute.
Simmer for 2 minutes. Serve this sauce with grilled venison steaks or
pheasant breasts
