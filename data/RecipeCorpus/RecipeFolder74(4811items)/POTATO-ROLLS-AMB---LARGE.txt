MISTY SIMON-----------------
3/4 c  Water
1/2 c  + 1 tb Milk
1 lg Egg
2 tb Butter
1/3 c  Potato flakes
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
3 c  Flour
2 1/2 ts Yeast
Place all ingredients into bread machine. Program for dough and press
start. At the end of the cycle, punch down the dough and turn out
onto a lightly floured board. Divide dough and allow to rest for 5 to
10 minutes. Divide each half of dough into 12 even pieces. Turn the
ball of dough inside out and pinch the ends together on the bottom.
This will give you a smooth ball. Place seam side down on ungreased
cookie sheet (if your cookie sheet looks like its seen better days,
spray a thin layer of nonstick spray). You can either have sides
touching for soft-sided rolls or not touching for more "crusty"
rolls. Allow to rise 30 - 40 minutes or until doubled. Bake in an
oven preheated to 425 for 15 to 18 minutes or until of desired
browness.
