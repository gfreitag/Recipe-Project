Categories: Cakes
Yield: 48 Servings
Cake:
1    Box butter cake mix
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Butter
Topping:
16 oz Light brown sugar
1/2 c  Butter
2    Eggs
2 ts Flour
1 1/2 c  Pecans; chopped
1 ts Vanilla
Make cake using mix, eggs and 1/2 cup butter. Follow recipe on box
but bake only 20 minutes in a well greased cake pan, measuring 13" x
9" x 2" or larger. Make topping by cooking sugar, butter, eggs and
flour together for 3 minutes. Add pecans and vanilla. Spread topping
over cakes and bake 8 to 10 minutes @ 350 degrees. Note: Do not make
topping until cake is cooked because sugar will crystallize or harden
while waiting.
