Categories: Condiments, Jams
Yield: 1 Servings
3 lb Red bell peppers; (12 mediu
-m to large peppers)
1/2    Unsalted butter; (4 tablesp
-oons)
1/2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
10    Cl Garlic; minced (about 3 r
-nded tablespoons)
1/2 c  Fresh ginger; coarsely grat
-ed
Grated zest of 3 oranges
3/4 c  Fresh orange juice
3 tb Sugar
2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1.  Core and seed the peppers, and cut them into 1/4-inch wide
lengthwise strips (you should have 12 cups). 2. Heat the butter and
oil in a heavy flameproof casserole.  Add the garlic and ginger, and
cook over low heat for 5 minutes.  Add the peppers, and stir well to
coat. 3. Mix in the orange zest, juice, sugar and pepper. Stir gently
and cover. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until
the peppers are wilted and their skins are soft, 25 minutes. 4.
Remove the cover and continue cooking over low heat, stirring
frequently, until most of the liquid has evaporated, 2 hours. 5.
Serve hot or at room temperature. This keeps, covered tightly, in the
refrigerator for up to 4 days. Makes 4 cups. Authors' note: This is a
slightlyb swet condiment with a bite to it. Great served with grilled
chicken or bef, sausages, lamb, on a sandwich, in a potato, or with
game. Try to always have some on hand--it's addictive. Source: The
