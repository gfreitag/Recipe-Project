Categories: Bakery, Indian, Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
3 ea Potatoes, peeled
2 ea Green chiles, chopped
1 ts Crushed red chiles
1 tb Cilantro
1 1/2 ts Mango powder
1 ts Salt
2 tb Oil
5 oz White flour

Boil potatoes, drain & mash.  Stir in the chiles, cilantro, mango
powder, salt & oil.  Gradually stir in the flour to form a soft
dough. Divide into 6 pieces & roll out into 5" rounds. Set aside.

Heat a griddle, place a roti on the griddle, drop about 1 ts oil
around the edges & lift them gently so the oil slips under the roti.
Pour another ts oil onto the roti & gently turn over.

When lightly browned, remove & set aside.  Cook all the rolls in this
way & serve hot.
