Skin, clean, cut into pieces and dredge the rabbit[s] in flour. In a
skillet render the salt pork and saute the shallots and mushrooms 5
min. If you don't have shallots, substitute mild onion plus a small
clove of garlic. Remove and reserve the mushroom mixture. Saute the
rabbit pieces until browned. Add the stock, wine and spice bag and
simmer until tender, about 2 hours. Remove the spice bag and add the
mushroom mixture 10 minutes before serving. Just before serving stir
in a jigger of brandy and a swirl of butter. The gravy can optionally
be thickened with a slurry of flour and water. Or the flour and
butter can be made into a roux and added.
