Title: RONIERI'S CRISPY SPINACH
Categories: Miamiherald, Side dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 pk Whole fresh spinach leaves
-(about 1 lb)
Vegetable oil for frying
Salt to taste
Wash spinach well if it is not packaged ready to use. Spin dry or pat
with a paper towel.  Leaves should be absolutely dry. In a deep fryer
or large pot, heat oil to 375 degrees. Submerge the spinach into the
hot oil, being careful so oil does not spatter.  Stir continously for
1 minute, until spinach crisps up. Drain well, season to taste with
salt and serve immediately.
