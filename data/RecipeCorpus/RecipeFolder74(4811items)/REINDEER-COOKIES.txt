Title: REINDEER COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Kids
Yield: 12 Servings
1 c  Sifted powdered sugar
2 tb Whipping cream
1 ts Vanilla
12    Graham cracker squares (plus
-extras for breakage)
24    Mini-chocolate chips
12    Red cinnamon candies
12    Mini-pretzels, cut in half
Combine sugar, cream, and vanilla.  Mix well and set aside. Cut graham
crackers diagonally in half using a gentle sawing motion with a
serrated knife (cutting in a firm motion will break the crackers).
Spread a small amount of frosting over the top side of a cracker
half. Top with remaining cracker half, placing cut sides opposite
each other so two narrow ends meet to form reindeer nose.

Spread a small amount of frosting to cover the top cracker. Gently
press chocolate chips on reindeer for eyes and cinnamon candy for
nose. Add pretzel halves for antlers. Repeat procedure for remaining
ingredients. Let dry on a wire rack.  Makes 12.
