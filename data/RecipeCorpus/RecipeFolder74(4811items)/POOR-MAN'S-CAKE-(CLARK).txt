Title: POOR MAN'S CAKE (CLARK)
Categories: Low-fat, Desserts, Cakes
Yield: 12 Servings
1 c  Brown sugar
1 1/4 c  Water
1/3 c  Vegetable shortening *
1 ts Salt
2 c  Flour
2/3 c  Raisins
1/2 ts Nutmaeg
2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Cloves
1 ts Soda
2 ts Water
1 ts Baking powder
(the name comes from the fact that the cake calls for no eggs, no
milk, and no butter)

*NOTE:  (Since the shortening is melted, I substituted Canola oil,
thus, I think, saving a LOT of cholestrol and saturated fats!)

Boil brown sugar, 1 1/4 C water, oil or shortneing, raisins and spices
together for three minutes.  Let cool to room temperature.

Add salt and baking soda, dissolved in 2 tsp water. Sift together
flour and baking powder, add gradually, beating after each addition.

Grease and flour 8" square pan.  (I used nonfat spray instead).

Bake at 325 for approximately 50 minutes, until it tests done.

Needs no frosting.

(would be HEAVENLY with a big blob of whipped cream...but it's really
unnecessary.  this sucker is GOOD!)
