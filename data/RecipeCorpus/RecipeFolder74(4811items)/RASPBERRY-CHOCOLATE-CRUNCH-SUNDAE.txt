Make the raspberry sauce:

1. In a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade, combine
the raspberries, sugar, Chambord, and lemon juice. Process the
mixture for 30 to 45 seconds, or until smooth. Strain the purÂ‚e
through a fine-meshed sieve into a small bowl. Cover with plastic
wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, until chilled.

Assemble the sundaes:

1. In a chilled 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer,
using the wire whip attachment, beat the cream, sugar, and vanilla at
medium-high speed until slightly stiff peaks begin to form. Transfer
the cream to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip (such as Ateco #7)
and refrigerate the cream until ready to use.

2. Spoon about l 1/2 tablespoons of the raspberry sauce into the
bottom of a large sundae glass. Add 4 or 5 raspberries. Coarsely
crumble 2 amaretti cookies over the berries and drizzle with 1
teaspoon Chambord. Place a small scoop of the raspberry sorbet and
vanilla ice cream on top of the cookie layer. Drizzle about 1 1/2
tablespoons of the chocolate syrup over the scoop. Top with a scoop
of chocolate ice cream and a drizzle of raspberry sauce and 4 or 5
raspberries. Coarsely crumble 2 more amaretti cookies over the
berries and drizzle with 1 teaspoon Chambord. Top with a scoop of
raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream. Drizzle with some of the
raspberry sauce. Pipe a large rosette of whipped cream on top of the
sundae and garnish with fresh raspberries and an amaretti

cookie. Repeat this procedure to make 4 sundaes. Serve immediately.
