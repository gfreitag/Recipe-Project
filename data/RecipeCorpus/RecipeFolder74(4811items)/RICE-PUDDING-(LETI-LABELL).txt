Title: RICE PUDDING (LETI LABELL)
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Rice
1 qt Milk
1/4 c  Sugar
Dad's  recipe  - this is my favorite - a great way  to use up extra
milk.

Cinnamon

Cook  milk  and rice for about 35 minues, just  below boiling. Watch
carefully during the last 15 minutes, to be sure that it doesn't boil
over. 5 minutes before completion, add sugar, stirring constantly.
Pour into a pie  pan  and  top  with cinnamon.

Serve warm or cold.
