1 ts Fresh garlic -- mince
1 ts Sugar

In a small bowl combine the seasoning mix ingredients. Combine 1
stick of the butter, the garlic, worcestershire and seasoning mix in
a large skillet over high heat.  When the butter is melted add the
shrimp (deheaded with shell still on)  Cook for 2 minutes, shaking
the pan. Don't stir. Add chicken stock; cook and shake pan for 2
minutes. Add the beer and cook and shake the pan 1 minute longer.
Remove from heat. Serve in bowls with a lot of French bread to dip in
sauce. Very important to shake pan back and forth and NOT to stir, to
blend the sauce well and to prevent oily texture. Source:  James
