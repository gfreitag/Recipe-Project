Title: ROSE'S MOUSSE AU CHOCOLAT
Categories: Pudding, Mousse, Chocolate
Yield: 8 Servings
3    Eggs; separated
1 1/2 tb Water
2 tb Cognac or Kahlua
4 oz Good-quality bittersweet or
-semi-sweet chocolate
1 c  Whipping cream
1 1/2 tb Superfine sugar (omit if
-using semi-sweet chocolate)
In a heavy saucepan over very low heat or a double-boiler over
simmering water, melt chocolate. Reserve and allow to cool slightly.

In a heavy saucepan over very low heat or a double-boiler over
simmering water, whisk egg yolks and water until mixture begins to
thicken. Whisk in cognac; continue to whisk until mixture has
thickened to the consistency of Hollandaise sauce. Remove from heat
and whisk in melted chocolate. Set aside.

In a small bowl of an electric mixer, beat cream just until it holds
soft peaks. If chocolate mixture has stiffened, heat gently over very
low heat, whisking constantly, until slightly softened. Transfer
mixture to a large bowl; whisk in 1/2 cup of the whipped cream. Fold
in remaining whipped cream with a large whisk or spatula, then cut
through with a spatula or curved fingers to eliminate large air
bubbles. Set aside.

Beat egg whites until they hold soft peaks. Beat in sugar (if used)
just until mixture holds stiff peaks. Stir a small amount of the egg
whites until chocolate mixture to lighten it; then fold in remaining
egg whites. Spoon into a serving bowl or 8 small molds. Refrigerate
at least 4 hours or until firm. Garnish just before serving with
chocolate curls, if desired.
