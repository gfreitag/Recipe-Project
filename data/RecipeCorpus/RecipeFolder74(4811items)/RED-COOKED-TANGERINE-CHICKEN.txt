chicken and chop into large chunks. Mix sauce ingredients.

Browning:  Add peanut oil to moderately hot wok.  When oil is hot,
brown chicken pieces; remove pieces from oil with strainer and drain
over bowl.

Slow-cooking:  Remove all oil from wok; heat to moderate. Add peel,
sherry, and sauce (remixed first); add boiling water. Bring to
simmer. Add chicken pieces.  Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until
chicken is tender but still adhering to bones.  When tender, remove
pieces from sauce. Transfer 1 cup of sauce, less the spices, to a
saucepan; thicken with cornstarch paste to a light gravy.

Arrange chicken pieces on large serving platter to resemble the shape
of a chicken.  Place bunch of parsley or watercress at the tail, a
flower roll at the head with a piece of star anise for a beak. Pour
sauce over chicken when ready to serve.
