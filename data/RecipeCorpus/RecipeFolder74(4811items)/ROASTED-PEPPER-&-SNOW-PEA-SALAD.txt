Categories: Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Red bell peppers
3/4 lb Snow peas
Salt to taste
1    Small red onion; peeled
1 tb Dijon mustard
2 tb Red-wine vinegar
1/2 ts Ground cumin
Pepper to taste
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Finely chopped parsley
Preheat broiler or prepare a charcoal grill. Place peppers under
broiler or on grill and cook on all sides until skin is well charred.
When cool enough to handle, split peppers in half, core and discard
charred skin.  Cut peppers lengthwise into thin strips. There should
be about 1 cup.  Put the strips in a salad bowl.
Bring enough water to a boil to cover the snow peas and boil 2
minutes. Drain in a sieve.  Run cold water over snow peas and drain.
Add to salad bowl.
Cut onion in half, then cut each half crosswise into thin slices
and add them to the bowl.
Put mustard, vinegar and cumin in a separate bowl and add salt and
pepper.  Beat vigorously with a whisk, adding oil. Stir in the
parsley. Pour dressing over vegetables and toss. Source: Pierre
