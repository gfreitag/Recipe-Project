Title: RED BEANS & RICE (PRODIGY)
Categories: None
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Dry kidney beans
2    Ham hocks
1 md Onion; finely chopped
2    Garlic cloves; minced
3 c  Rice
RINSE THE BEANS, then soak them overnight in enough water to cover
them by 1 inch. Put the beans, the soaking liquid, the ham hocks and
3 cups of water into a stock pot. Cover, bring to a boil, and simmer
until the beans are just tender, about 1 hour. Remove the ham hocks
and let them cool. Add the onions and garlic to the pot and simmer
for 10 minutes. Slice the meat off the ham hocks and add to the pot.
Add the rice and simmer until the rice is tender and the water is
absorbed (it may be necessary to add more water).
