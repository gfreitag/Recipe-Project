Gradually add the polenta to the 4 C water or stock, stirring as it is
added to prevent lumps from forming. Cook over low heat, stirring
frequently, about every 5 min for about 30 - 40 min. The polenta burns
easily. It hhas finished cooking when the mixture is hard to stir and
the stirring spoon is able to stand within the polents. Before it
becomes too thick, you may want to add salt to taste. Add sm. amounts
of liquid if the cornmeal is not cooked and toom much liquid has
evaporated. Once cooked, transfer the polenta to a baking dish or
cookie sheet and smooth out until it is a uniform height. Allow to
cool somewhat. While this is cooling prepare the tomato sauce.

To start the sauce, puree the tomatoes with their canned liquid. Set
aside. Braise the onions in red wine with the garlic, basil and
oregano. When tie wine has been reduced and the onions are tender,
add the pureed tomatoes. Cook for approx. an hour, stirring
frequently, until the sauce is thick and with little visible liquid.
Season with salt and pepper to taste. There should be about 1 1/2 C
sauce.

Serve the polenta with tomato sauce ladled over the top. Garnish with
basil or Italian parsley.

This is EXCELLENT!
