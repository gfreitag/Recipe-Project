Categories: Msl, Desserts, Ice cream
Yield: 1 Quart
1 lb Rhubarb (about 8 stalks),
-cut into 1-inch pieces
4    1/2-pt containers
-raspberries
2 c  Whole milk
1/4 c  Heavy cream
3 tb Corn syrup
1/3 c  Nonfat dry milk
1 1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 t  Unflavored gelatin
Place rhubarb and 3 Tablespoons water in a medium saucepan. Cook over
medium heat, stirring often, until very soft and most of the liquid
has evaporated, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat and puree rhubarb
with 1 1/2 pints of the raspberries. Strain puree and set aside to
cool. Meanwhile, combine milk, cream, and corn syrup in a small
saucepan. Heat to barely boiling. Combine dry milk, sugar, and
gelatin and whisk in. Bring back to barely boiling to dissolve
gelatin, and remove pan from heat. Pass mixture through a strainer
into a medium bowl set over an ice bath to chill. Stir in fruit
puree, then freeze in an ice-cream maker according to manufacturer's
instructions. Add remaining raspberries and mix in machine until
combined, about 30 seconds. Store in a plastic container.

STRAWBERRY VARIATION: Substitute 2 1/2 pints strawberries, hulled,
for the rhubarb and raspberries.

APRICOT VARIATION: Substitute 2 1/2 pounds (10 to 12) ripe apricots,
pitted, for the rhubarb and raspberries.
