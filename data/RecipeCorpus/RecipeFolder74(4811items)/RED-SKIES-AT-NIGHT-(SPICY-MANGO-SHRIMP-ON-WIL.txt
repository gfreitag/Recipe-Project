Slice the shrimp lengthwise in half, rinse in cold water and pat dry.
Combine the lime juice, soy sauce, flour, cornstarch, baking soda and
egg in bowl and mix well. Add the shrimp, cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Mix together the scallions, ginger,
chilies, and garlic in a small bowl and set aside. Mix together the
sugar, soy sauce, mango, rum and lime juice for the sauce in another
small bowl and set aside. Heat 2 cups of oil to 350 degrees in a wok
or deep frying pan.  Add half the shrimp and stir briskly until the
shrimp turn whitish-pink, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove to drain on paper
towels. Cook the rest of the shrimp in the same manner. Remove all
but 2 tablespoons of oil from the wok, add the scallion mixture and
stir on high heat until it begins to colour.  Add the sauce
ingredients and stir until the mixture bubbles. Return the shrimp to
the wok and stir to coat with the sauce for a minute or two.
Transfer to a holding container and keep warm. Heat 2 tablespoons of
oil in the wok, add the sherry, soy sauce, and sugar and stir to heat
through. Add the greens-spinach mixture and stir briskly at high heat
just until wilted.  Remove from heat, fold in cilantro or basil and
transfer to serving platter. Place the shrimp on the greens and
garnish with mango and carambola slices.
