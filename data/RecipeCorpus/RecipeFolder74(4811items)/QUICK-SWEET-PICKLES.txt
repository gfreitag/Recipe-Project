Title: QUICK SWEET PICKLES
Categories: Pickles, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe
8 lb Pickling cucumbers
-- (3- to 4-inch)
1/3 c  Canning or pickling salt
4 1/2 c  Sugar
3 1/2 c  Vinegar (5 percent)
2 ts Celery seed
1 tb Whole allspice
2 tb Mustard seed
1 c  Pickling lime (optional)*
*(for use in variation below for making firmer pickles)

May be canned as either strips or slices.

Yield: About 7 to 9 pints

Procedure: Wash cucumbers. Cut 1/16-inch off blossom end and discard,
but leave 1/4 inch of stem attached. Slice or cut in strips, if
desired. Place in bowl and sprinkle with 1/3 cup salt. Cover with 2
inches of crushed or cubed ice. Refrigerate 3 to 4 hours. Add more
ice as needed. Drain well.

Combine sugar, vinegar, celery seed, allspice, and mustard seed in
6-quart kettle. Heat to boiling.

Hot pack--Add cucumbers and heat slowly until vinegar solution
returns to boil. Stir occasionally to make sure mixture heats evenly.
Fill sterile jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. For more information
see "Jars and Lids".

Raw pack--Fill jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Add hot pickling
syrup, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process according
to the recommendations in Table 1 or use the low-temperature
pasteurization treatment. For more information see "Low-Temperature
Pasteurization Treatment".

Variation for firmer pickles: Wash cucumbers. Cut 1/16-inch off
blossom end and discard, but leave 1/4-inch of stem attached. Slice
or strip cucumbers. Mix 1 cup pickling lime and 1/2 cup salt to 1
gallon water in a 2- to 3-gallon crock or enamel-ware container.
Caution: Avoid inhaling lime dust while mixing the lime-water
solution. Soak cucumber slices or strips in lime water solution for
12 to 24 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove from lime solution and
rinse and resoak 1 hour in fresh cold water. Repeat the rinsing and
resoaking two more times. Handle carefully because slices or strips
will be brittle. Drain well.

Storage: After processing and cooling, jars should be stored 4 to 5
weeks to develop ideal flavor.

Variation: Add 2 slices of raw whole onion to each jar before filling
with cucumbers.
