Title: RED CURRY SAUCE
Categories: Condiments, Spices, Sauces, Thai
Yield: 1 1/2 cups
RED CURRY SAUCE
1 tb Fried garlic in oil
1 tb Fried shallots in oil
4 tb Red prik kaeng (chili paste)
1 c  Coconut milk
2 tb Prik chi fa daeng
(red jalapenas),
Sliced finely
2 tb 'ginger'
2 tb Fish sauce
Pinch of sugar
The common thread of all these is to prepare a sauce base. Similar
sauces can be made from any Thai curry paste: the basic method is
simple: the paste is fried, dissolved in coconut milk, and a
colorant, taste extender and flavor element are added.

Note fried garlic in oil and fried shallots in oil are so basic that
most Thai cooks keep some ready made. It will keep in the fridge for
two or three months. It is best made in a small deep fat frier.

However if you don't have any put a tablespoon of oil in a medium hot
wok and stir fry a tablespoon of garlic (or shallots) until they just
change color and the oil becomes aromatic. RED CURRY SAUCE

In a wok heat (or cook) the garlic and shallots, and add the prik
kaeng, and stir until combined and aromatic. In a wok push it up the
side of pan away from the heat. If you are using a saucepan remove
and set aside.

Heat the coconut milk until nearly boiling and lower the heat. Add the
chili paste, a quarter at a time, and stir until dissolved.

Now add the remaining ingredients, and stir until heated through.

You can increase or reduce the shallots/garlic and chili paste
together by a factor of two (ie if you halve the chili paste, halve
the garlic and shallots also. If you double them double them all).
Similarly the jalapenas, ginger and fish sauce can be adjusted by up
to a factor of two to give the flavor balance you want.

'ginger' gives the dish and afterburn. You can use any mixture of
khing (common green ginger), kha (galangal), or kachai (lesser
ginger) you wish. Walt Colonel Ian F. Khuntilanont-Philpott
