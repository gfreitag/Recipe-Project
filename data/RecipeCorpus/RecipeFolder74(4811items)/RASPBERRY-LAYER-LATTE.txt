Title: RASPBERRY LAYER LATTE
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 Servings
2    To 3 oz hot esspresso
4 oz Raspberry syrup
Vanilla powder for dusting
Ground cinnamon for dusting
Steam the syrup and milk together and pour the densly steamed milk
into a 12 oz glass, until the glass is about 2/3 full. Gently pour
(or spoon) the lightly foamed milk on top to about 1" below the lip
of the glass. Slowly pour the esspresso through the middle of the
foam peak. The esspresso will form a rich dark layer between the
layers of milk. Dust with vanilla and cinnamon powders.  Delicious
and beautiful.
