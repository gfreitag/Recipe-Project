Title: PUPPY GO AWAY
Categories: Info/tips
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Oil of cloves
1 tb Paprika
1 ts Black pepper
Mix the oil, paprika and pepper and pour it into a small container
with a tight-fitting lid. Label and keep away from children.

To use: Dab it on your furniture legs, chairs, tables, rugs to
discourage puppies from getting on the furniture. The scent will wear
off after awhile, you may have to reapply it if your puppy isn't
completely trained.

This solution works to keep puppies away from furniture and rugs. The
scent isn't distasteful to people, only to ultra-"scent"-sitive
puppies.
