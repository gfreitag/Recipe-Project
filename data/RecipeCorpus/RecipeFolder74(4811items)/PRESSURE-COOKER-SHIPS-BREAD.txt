Some notes on using a pressure cooker for baking: Method 1 - Uses the
pressure cooker as the loaf pan. Grease inside of cooker well and
sprinkle interior with cornmeal. If making sweet breads, omit the
cornmeal. Method 2 ~ Uses the pressure cooker as an oven. YOU MUST
REMOVE THE PRESSURE RELIEF PLUG AND RUBBER SEAL. The high
temperatures will damage them.

In all cases, a "flame tamer" should be used to prevent scorching.
Unless specified, water should be lukewarm.

Ships Bread - Method 1

Combine water, yeast, and honey and let stand without stirring. When
yeast has dissolved (about 5 minutes), stir and knead in flour. Let
dough rise in warm place until doubled in bulk. Punch down and turn
into the cooker. Allow to rise again until doubled. Bake over medium
flame for about 45 minutes. You can turn the loaf over half way thru
the baking to allow for more even browning.
