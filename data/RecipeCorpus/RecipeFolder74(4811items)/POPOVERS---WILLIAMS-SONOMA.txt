Title: POPOVERS - WILLIAMS SONOMA
Categories: Popovers, Pies & past
Yield: 6 Servings
2    Eggs
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Milk
2 tb Unsalted butter -- melted
1 c  All-purpose flour
Butter a 6-cup popover or Texas-sized muffin pan.

In a medium bowl lightly wisk together the eggs and salt. Stir in the
milk and butter and beat in the flour until just blended. DO NOT
OVERBEAT! Fill each cup about half full using all the batter.

Place popovers in a cold oven, set the temperature to
425    degrees F and bake for 20 minutes. Popovers should rise
considerably during this time. Reduce oven to 375 F and continue
baking 10-15 minutes longer until popovers are golden and crisp on
the outside. Quickly pierce each popover with a thin metal skewer or
the tip of a small knife to release the steam. Turn the oven off and
leave in for 5-10 minutes more for further crisping. Remove and serve
at once.

Makes 6 popovers which are about 142 calories each.
