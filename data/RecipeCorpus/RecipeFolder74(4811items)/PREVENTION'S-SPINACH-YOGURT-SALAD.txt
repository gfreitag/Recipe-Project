chopped parsley added to a cup of yogurt. - or 1 c. grated tender
Middle Eastern cucumber (leave the skin on!), 1 tbsp. minced red
onion (soak in lemon juice for 1 minute), 2 tbsp. currants, etc. - or
include fennel bulb with the greens - or spice it up with a pinch of
cumin. ------[mcRecipe/patH.24Au96]
