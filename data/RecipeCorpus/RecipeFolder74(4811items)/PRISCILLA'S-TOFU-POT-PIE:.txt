Cut the tofu into 1/2" cubes.  Mix the flour, salt, pepper and garlic
powder.  Add the tofu cubes and toss till coated. Saute in a large
skillet with the 2 tablespoons oil. When tofu is golden and crisp,
stir in the chopped onion.  Continue cooking 3 minutes, then add the
carrots, celery, peas, and water. Cover the pan and cook over medium
heat. Stir gently, every minute or so, till the carrots are just
tender. Remove from heat and stir in:

Melt margerine in a large saucepan, then add the sliced mushrooms.
Cover pan and saute over medium heat till mushrooms are soft. Stir in
flour and seasonings and cook over low heat 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in
water and simmer, uncovered, till gravy is thickened - about 10
minutes. Mix half the gravy into the tofu and vegetables. Set
remainder aside.

For CRUST: Combine flour, wheat germ, and salt and stir to mix. Cut in
margerine till mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add cold water all
at once and stir just enough to form dough into a ball. Divide in
half and roll first half out on a floured surface.  Place in a
10-inch pie plate. Roll out remaining half of dough and set aside.

Spread tofu and vegetable mixture into the dough-lined dish (this was
too much for my 9 inch casserole dish. Since it didn't fit, I reserved
something like 1 1/2 to 2 cups as a topping for when it was cooked,
as a sortof makeshift gravy.  Using a larger pan would probably work
as well, if not better)..  Pour remaining gravy over top and cover
with top crust. Fold edges of top and bottom crusts together and
pinch to form edge. Cut 4 to 6 1-inch slits in top crust to allow
steam to escape (my method is to just flatten pieces of dough and
place over pie. Where the pieces overlap there is usually a gap of
some sort for steam and juices to bubble through). Bake in a
preheated 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 350, and
bake an additional 20 to 30 minutes, till crust is nicely browned.

Hints: If there is way too much gravy for you to fit in your
casserole pan, leave out the excess and serve over individual pieces
as you serve it.
