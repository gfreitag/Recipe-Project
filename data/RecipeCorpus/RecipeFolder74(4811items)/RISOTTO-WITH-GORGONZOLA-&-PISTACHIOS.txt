Title: RISOTTO WITH GORGONZOLA & PISTACHIOS
Categories: Italian, Rice
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Olive Oil
1/2 sm Onion -- finely chopped
3/4 c  Arborio Rice
1/2 c  Dry White Wine
2 3/4 c  Chicken Stock -- (approx)
1/3 c  Crumbled Gorgonzola Cheese
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
To taste
1/2 c  Freshly Grated Parmesan
3 tb Unsalted Butter
4 tb Shelled Pistachios -- finely
Chopped
Heat oil in heavy saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion until
translucent, about 3 minutes. Add rice and stir 1 minute. Add wine
and stir until liquid has evaporated.

Meanwhile, heat chicken stock to a low simmer in a separate saucepan.
Reduce heat, cover and keep warm.

Add 1/2 cup stock to rice and simmer until liquid is absorbed,
stirring frequently. Continue adding remaining stock, 1/2 cup at a
time, in the same fashion, allowing each addition to be completely
absorbed before adding more. This should take about 30 minutes. The
rice will be done when tender but still slightly firm to the bite on
the inside. Don't allow it to overcook and keep in mind you may not
need to add all of the stock and you may find you need a bit more.

Add Gorgonzola and stir until melted. Remove from heat. Season with
pepper. Stir in Parmesan, butter and 3 Tbs of pistachios. Transfer to
serving dish. Sprinkle with remaining pistachios
