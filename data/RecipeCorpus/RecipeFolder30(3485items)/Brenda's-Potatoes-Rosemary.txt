Fat grams    per serving:
Spread the potatoes evenly in a 9 X 12" baking pan that has been
sprayed lightly with a non-stick vegetable oil spray. Do these next
steps in this order: Salt & pepper the potatoes, pour the oil over
and toss to distribute the oil evenly.  Crush the rosemary in the
palm of the hand and distribute across the potatoes.  Distribute the
cheese across the potatoes. Add the water down the side of the pan, a
little in each corner such that none of the seasonings are washed off
the potatoes. You should end up with about 1/4" of water in the
bottom of the pan. The object is to have the water steam the potatoes
then boil off so the flavorings can be picked up by the potatoes.
Place in center of 425 deg oven and cook for 45 min or until the
potatoes are done and the cheese browns slightly. From the collection
