Categories: Poultry, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Lemon Juice

In a large skillet, heat the oil, half a teaspoon at a time and cook
the turkey in 4 batches over medium high heat for about 2 minutes on
each side or until cooked.  Sprinkle with about half the salt and
pepper.  Remove from the pan and hold in a warm oven.  Turn the heat
to high and pour in the orange juice and lemon juice; stir in the
currant jelly, tarragon and the remaining salt and pepper.  Boil

have collected around the turkey and boil for 1 minute.  Remove the
pan from the heat and swirl in the butter. Pour over the turkey and
serve.  From: Syd's Cookbook.
