Title: Mystery Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Desserts
Yield: 1 cup
1 ds Angostura bitters
2 ds Lemon juice
1    Jigger Cointreau or
-Gran Marnier
2 tb Butter
4 tb Brown sugar
1 cn Junior Apricot baby food
1/2 c  Pineapple juice
1 ts Cornstarch
This sauce is very quick and easy to prepare because it starts with
baby food puree rather than fresh or dried apricots.

Melt butter in a small saucepan and stir in brown sugar. Heat until
bubbling and starting to turn into butterscotch. Remove from the heat
and allow to cool slightly. Make a slurry of the pineapple juice and
starch and stir it into the butter-sugar mixture. Add enough
Angostura and lemon juice, so that it is not too sweet. Add the
jigger of liqueur. Serve warm on cake, puddings, ice cream, custard,
waffles, crepes, bananas etc. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   05-07-95
