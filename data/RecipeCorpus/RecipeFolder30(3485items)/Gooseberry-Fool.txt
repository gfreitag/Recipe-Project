Title: Gooseberry Fool
Categories: British isl, Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
Sugar
6 oz Double cream
4 oz Single cream
1 1/2 lb Gooseberries; tart green
Ones preferably
1 1/2 oz Butter
Remove the tops and the tails from the gooseberries. Melt the butter
in a pan, add the fruit and 4 heaped tablespoons of sugar. Cover the
pan closely and simmer gently until the gooseberries are yellow and
soft enough to be crushed. Pour into a measuring jug. Put an equal
amount of cream into a bowl and whisk until thick. Mix in the
gooseberries and adjust the sweetening to taste. Serve in small bowls
with almond biscuits or sponge fingers.

Many people think that "fool" comes from the French verb "fouler", to
crush, which is what one does to the gooseberries in this recipe.
Unfortunately, etymologists insist that it is a humorous name, like
trifle, and whim-wham, which also means trifle.
