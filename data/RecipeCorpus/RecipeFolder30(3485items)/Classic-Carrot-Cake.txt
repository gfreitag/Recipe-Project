CLASSIC CARROT CAKE

................................................................... I
first tasted this carrot cake at a gala tea party hosted by a young
bride who had just escaped from Iran. Someone whispered to me that
the cake was so full of nuritious ingredients, it made her feel less
guilty about having a second piece.

Beat eggs until light and fluffy, adding sugar gradually. Stir in oil,
nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, carrots and water. Sift together flour, baking
soda, and baking powder, and beat into mixture until smooth. Blend in
nuts and raisins. Pour into a well-greased, 10 inch tube pan or Bundt
pan. Bake in preheated 350 F oven for 55 60 minutes.
