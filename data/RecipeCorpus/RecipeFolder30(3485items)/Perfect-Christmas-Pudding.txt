Title: Perfect Christmas Pudding
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Powdered allspice
1 ts Powdered cinnamon
1 ts Powdered cloves
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Light molasses
1 c  Chopped, walnut meats
-- (toasted)
3    Egg whites
24    California dried figs
1 1/2 c  Milk
1 c  Shortening
2 c  Soft bread crumbs,
-- lightly packed down
3/4 c  Granulated sugar
3 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
1 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
With scissors, snip stems from figs.  Then snip figs into small
pieces. Heat them in milk in top of double boiler until figs are soft
(about 20 minutes).  Remove from heat, stir figs thoroughly until
mashed.  Add shortening, bread crumbs, sugar and tapioca.  Sift and
measure flour, and sift again with other dry ingredients.  Add with
molasses and chopped walnuts.  Fold in stiffly whipped egg whites.
Turn into generously buttered 2-quart mold, cover tightly and steam,
covered, for 3 hours on a rack in hot water that must come half-way
up side of mold.  Or steam in individual molds.  Serve piping hot,
with burning red candle on top.  Deck with holly, and be generous
with the hard sauce!  Serves 8-10.
