"Chopped seasoning" is a popular blend of spices on the Caribbean
island of Barbados.  Bajans, as the residents are known, use the
blend of seasonings to marinate chicken, fish (especially fried
flying fish), and pork.

In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, place all of the
ingredients except the chicken.  Process for 30 seonds, forming a
paste. Scrape the sides at least once during the processing.  Place
the chicken in a bowl, covering it with the paste.  Force the paste
into any crevices in the chicken.  Marinate for 4 to 6 hours.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Place the chicken in a baking dish in a single layer and bake for 45
minutes, until the meat pulls easily from the bone.  Turn the chicken
after 20 minutes and baste with the pan juices.   Serve with rice,
and curried vegetables.
