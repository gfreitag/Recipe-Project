peas and boil just until crisp tender, about 45 seconds. Drain peas
in colander and cool immediately under cold running water. Drain well
and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add onion, garlic, oil, salt and
pepper to taste. Toss gently to combine. Refrigerate covered at least
30 minutes. Before serving, let warm to room temperature and stir in
lemon juice.  From: Syd's Cookbook.
