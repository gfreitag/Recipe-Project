Title: Pecan Brittle
Categories: Candies, Homemade
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Light Corn Syrup
1/2 c  Water
1 1/2 tb Butter
1 1/2 c  Pecan Halves Or Pieces
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Sugar
Sprinkle nuts with salt and warm them in a low oven. Mix the sugar,
corn syrup, and water and heat slowly, stirring until sugar is
dissolved. Continue cooking over moderate heat. The mixture is ready
when a small amount dropped in a cup of cold water becomes brittle
(260 F on a candy thermometer). Remove from heat and stir in butter
and warm nuts. Pour immediately onto a buttered cookie sheet. As soon
as the brittle is cool enough to handle, cut into squares, and wrap
in wax paper. Or wait until completely cooled and break into
irregular pieces. Yield: about 1 pound.
