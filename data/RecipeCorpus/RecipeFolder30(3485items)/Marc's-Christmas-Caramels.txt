Title: Marc's Christmas Caramels
Categories: Candies, Holiday
Yield: 64 servings
4    Unsweetened chocolate
Squares
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/2 c  Pecan halves
1/2 c  Candied cherries
2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Light cream
1 c  Butter
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
* Use red and green candied cherries, cut in half, as an optional
decoration for the top of caramel squares.

1. In large saucepan, combine the sugar, salt, cream, butter (best to
use butter instead of margarine for this recipe) syrup and chocolate.
Bring to a gentle boil over low heat. Cook, stirring frequently,
until mixture reaches 248 degrees on candy thermometer, or to the
firm-ball stage when a bit is dropped into cold water.

2. Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes. Stir in the vanilla
extract and pecans halves. Butter an 8-inch square pan and pour in
the candy. Press 32 cherries, cut in half, on candy if desired. Cool
candy until firm.

3. Cut into 1-inch pieces (should be 64), leaving a cherry half on
each piece. Place each piece on wax paper or in paper candy liners
found at cake decorating supply stores or gift shops.
