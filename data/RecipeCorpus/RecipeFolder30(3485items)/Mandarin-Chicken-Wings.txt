1/4 c  Water
1/8 c  Soy sauce

1/2 c  Slivered almonds, walnuts

Cut wings at first joint and discard the tips. Wash and dry on paper
towel and sprinkle lightly with garlic salt.

Mix cornstarch, eggs and water, stirring to form a smooth batter. Dip
wings in batter and deep fry in oil. LEt sit while making sauce.

Sweet and sour sauce: select a pan in which all wings can be coated
evenly, such as a large electric fry pan. Combine sugar, vinegar,
water, soy sauce, catsup and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
As sauce begins to thicken, add wings and cook on medium heat. Turn
wings carefully to coat thoroughly with sauce.

Garnish with nuts, if desired. Grated sesame adds a good flavor.

When scaling down for 15 wings, make the full sauce recipe and only
scale the batter part.
