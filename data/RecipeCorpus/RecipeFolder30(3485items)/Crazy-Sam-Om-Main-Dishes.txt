Title: Crazy Sam Om Main Dishes
Categories: Information

No ingredients
It ain't no secret, good cookin' is made of one part fine ingredients
and one part ingenuity.

Not I can do without my pots and pans sometimes. I can do without a
cookstove. And I don't always need the right recipe to throw together
the right meal.

But I can't do without my RO*TEL. It's won me more chili cookoffs than
maybe a fella's got a right to win. And I use it in all my main dish
recipes, from my Southwestern Shrimp Creole to my Shut Up and Eat It
Tex Mex Meatloaf. (One taste and you'll shut up and eat it.)

Plain and simple, RO*TEL will make a star out of any main dish you
serve.
