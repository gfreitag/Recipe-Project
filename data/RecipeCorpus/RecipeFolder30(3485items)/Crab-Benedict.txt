Title: Crab Benedict
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Seafood
Yield: 2 servings
Hollandaise Sauce
2    Split English Muffins
4    Eggs
4 oz Fresh Or Canned Crabmeat
Prepare the Hollandaise Sauce and set aside.  Remove any excess
liquid from the crabmeat and set aside.  Toast English muffins.
Poach eggs. Place 2 muffin halves on each plate.  Place 1 ounce
crabmeat on top of each muffin half.  Place a poached egg on top of
crabmeat.  Cover each muffin with Hollandaise sauce.  Place in
microwave and heat for 45 seconds. Serve immediately.  To make
traditional eggs benedict, just substitute Canadian Bacon for the
crabmeat.  This is a great breakfast or brunch dish. It is high in
calories but we do deserve a treat now and then. From: Syd's Cookbook.
