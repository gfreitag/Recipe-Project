Fat grams    per serving:
the Tuna Steaks quickly over a hot fire about 90 seconds - 2 minutes
per side. The object is to cook the outside leaving the inside
somewhat pink or "rare." Crush the green peppercorns with the back of
a spoon and set aside. Warm a sauce pan and add the oil and butter.
When warm, add the shallots and peppercorns and saute gently.
After about 5 minutes add the remaining ingredients. Time the
completion of the sauce with the completion of the fish. Remember
that hot fish can continue cooking if it sits. Pour the sauce across
the fish or lay the fish in a "bed" of sauce. From the collection of
