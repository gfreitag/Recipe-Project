Title: Italian Sausage and Peppers in Tomato Sauce
Categories: Meats, Italian, Pasta
Yield: 4 servings
1    Clove Garlic, Minced
4 lb Jar Ragu Spaghetti Sauce
Salt And Pepper To Taste
Oregano To Taste
3 tb Minced Dry Onion
2 lb Hot And Mild Italian Sausage
3 lg Green Bell Peppers
1 lg Red Bell Pepper
1 lg Gold Bell Pepper
1/2 lb Fresh Sliced Mushrooms
Remove the casings from the sausages.  In a Dutch oven brown the
sausages, then slice the sausages into 1/4" slices.  Add the Ragu
sauce to the pot. Remove the stems and seeds from the bell peppers.
Cook the peppers for 10 minutes on high setting in the microwave or
you can just add the peppers to the pot if you plan on letting the
mixture simmer for awhile before serving.  Add mushrooms, peppers,
garlic, onion, salt and pepper.  Heat the mixture over low heat and
simmer as long as you can.  About 15 minutes before serving, heat a
large pot of water to boiling and cook your choice of pasta,
preferably a large size pasta or macaroni to al dente.  When ready to
serve, add the cooked and drained pasta to the sausage and pepper
mixture and enjoy.  This is a great way to have sausage and peppers
during the winter when the peppers are more expensive than in the
summer, since it takes a fewer number than "Italian Sausage With
Green Peppers And Mushrooms".  From: Syd's Cookbook.
