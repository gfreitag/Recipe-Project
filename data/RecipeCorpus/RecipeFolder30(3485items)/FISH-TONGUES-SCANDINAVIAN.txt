Title: FISH TONGUES SCANDINAVIAN
Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 batch  Taken from:
Bull Cook and Authentic Historical Recipes and Practices

The Scandinavian people both Norwegian and Swedish are great
lovers of fish tongues, and consider them a great delicacy.
I have eaten them for years and like them very much; in fact they
are much better eating than the flesh of most fish.  The tongues from
stream trout, salmon, catfish, bullheads, walleyed pike and bluegills
are all very delicious and are very easy to prepare.

1. They can be boiled in lightly salted water from five to fifteen
minutes depending upon the size of the tongue.  Leave drain on paper
and serve with mustard or a sauce made from catsup and horseradish.

2. They can be French fried. It takes just a few minutes to fry them.
Drain and sprinkle lightly with powdered mustard.
