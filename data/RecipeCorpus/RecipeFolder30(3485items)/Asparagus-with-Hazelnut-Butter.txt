Title: Asparagus with Hazelnut Butter
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Cider Vinegar
Salt And Pepper To Taste
1 lb Cooked Asparagus
1 oz Finely Ground Hazelnuts
2 tb Butter
Wash asparagus under cold running water.  Snap off lower end of each
stalk with your fingers.  Let the stalk break where it wants to, this
will leave only the tender portion of the stalk.  Young tender
asparagus can be cooked in a steamer for 5-7 minutes, the more mature
stalks for 7-10 minutes. Do not over cook asparagus, it will lose
flavor and nutrients if over cooked. At the same time, place the
hazelnuts and butter in a small heavy skillet. Heat until the butter
melts and mix thoroughly.  Remove from heat and stir in vinegar.
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour hazelnut butter over hot
asparagus.  Serve at once.  From: Syd's Cookbook.
