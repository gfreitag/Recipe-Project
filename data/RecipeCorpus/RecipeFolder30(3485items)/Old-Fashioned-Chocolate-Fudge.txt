Title: Old-Fashioned Chocolate Fudge
Categories: Candies
Yield: 60 servings
4 tb Butter
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Cocoa
1 c  Milk
1. Combine sugar, cocoa and milk in a saucepan. Stir to blend, then
bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Turn to a simmer and do not
stir again.

2. Place candy thermometer in pan and cook until temperature reaches
238 degrees. If you are not using a thermometer, then cook until a
drop of this mixture in a cup of cold water forms a soft ball. Feel
the ball with your fingers to make sure it is right consistency.

3. Remove from heat and add butter and vanilla extract. Beat with a
wooden spoon until the fudge loses its sheen. Do not underbeat.

4. Pour into a greased (with butter or margarine) 8 x 8-inch pan and
let cool. Cut into about 60 squares.
