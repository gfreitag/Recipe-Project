Title: Revithia me Karidia (Chickpea Soup with Walnuts)
Categories: Soup/stew, Greek, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
Black pepper; to taste
4 c  Cooked chickpeas
1    Onion
8 oz Walnut pieces
2 tb Ground red pepper
-hot, mild, or a combination
A very simple, but hearty, Greek soup.  This is prepared by my
mother-in-law during Lent, when no oil or animal products are
consumed. Kyra Olga sometimes likes to thicken the soup with a bit of
flour added near the end of cooking.

Finely chop onion and walnuts.  Place in a soup pot with remaining
ingredients and enough water to cover by 1 or 2 inches.  Cook slowly
for 2 hours, or until soup is slightly thickened.  Adjust seasonings
and serve garnished with a sprinkling of chopped parsley and perhaps
a few drops of freshly squeezed lemon juice.
