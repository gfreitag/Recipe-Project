An American recipe of World War II vintage, this simple sauce is
excellent on pancakes or served over top-quality ice cream.

Combine a cup of blueberries, 1/4 cup sugar.  1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg in a saucepan and bring to the boil.  Boil
for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Serve hot.
