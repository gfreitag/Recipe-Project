Categories: Italian, Pasta
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Unsalted butter, softened

(Anna Teresa Callan's "Menus for Pasta")

Boil the potatoes in their jackets, drain, peel and put through a
ricer or food mill. While the potatoes are still warm, blend in the
flour, add the egg, egg yolk, butter and salt.

Place the potato mixture on a floured board and knead lightly; the
dough will be soft. Roll the dough in 1" thick sticks about 10" long.
Cut each roll into 3/4" pieces.

Rub each pieces of dough lightly over the coarse side of a cheese
grater. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the gnocchi
until they rise to the top of the water. Using a slotted spoon,
remove the gnocchi to a warm bowl. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, top
with tomato sauce and serve at once.
