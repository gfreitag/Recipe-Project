Title: Mint Chocolate Meringues
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 3 dozen
3/4 c  Coarsely chopped Andes Mints
3    Egg whites, room temp
1/2 c  Superfine sugar
Preheat oven to 275 degrees.  Line cookie sheets with parchment
paper. Beat the egg whites in a mixer bowl until foamy.  Gradually
beat in the sugar, 1 T at a time, and continue beating until the
peaks are very stiff and glossy.  Gently fold in the chopped candies.
Drop the meringue, in mounds of about 2 tsps, about 1" apart on the
paper-lined cookie sheets. Bake until the meringues are quite dry but
still slightly chewy inside, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Let cool completely.
