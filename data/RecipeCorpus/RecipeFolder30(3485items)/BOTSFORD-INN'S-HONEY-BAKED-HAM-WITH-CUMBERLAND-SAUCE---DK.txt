Place ham in large roasting pan and pour pineapple juice and honey
over top.  Sprinkle with brown sugar.  Bake at 325' two hours.

Meanwhile, to make sauce:  In large saucepan, pour hot water over
currants and let stand until plumped, about 20 minutes.

Cut orange and lemon rinds into very fine julienne about 3/4 inch
long; poach in simmering water 20 minutes.  Drain, discarding water,
and set aside.

Stir cornstarch mixture into currants and water; cook, stirring
constantly, over medium heat until sauce has thickened and become
transparent. Add brown sugar, orange and lemon juice, jelly and wine;
stir until jelly is melted and add prepared orange and lemon rinds
and black cherries. Serve warm over ham slices.  Makes about five
cups of sauce.

Di Note: The Botsford Inn is a very nice, old fashioned restaurant
located in Farmington, Michigan.  I had this there and really liked
it and managed to squeeze the recipe out of the chef.
