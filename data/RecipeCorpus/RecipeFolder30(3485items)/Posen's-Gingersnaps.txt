Title: Posen's Gingersnaps
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 4 dozen
2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Ginger
2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Cloves
1/4 c  Butter
1/2 c  Shortening
1 c  Brown sugar
1/4 c  Molasses
1    Egg
2 1/4 c  Flour
Preheat the oven to 350.  Cream the butter, shortening, brown sugar,
molasses and egg until light and fluffy. Sift together the dry
ingredients; combine both mixtures.  Form the dough into walnut size
balls. With floured fingers, press the balls into flat circles on a
ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 8 minutes, or until golden brown.
Remove the gingersnaps from the cookie sheet as soon as they are cool
and seal in a covered container to preserve their crunch. Source: Top
