or currants to begin with them as they take longer to cook than
raspberries, or blackberries. Do not use blue berries. Cut the crusts

sides of a 3-cup bowl or mold. Reserve 2 or 2 slices for the top.
Pour the fruit and juice while warm into the bowl. Place the
remaining bread slices on top, trimming to fit. Place a saucer on the
pudding and refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Unmold and
garnish with whipping cream and berries. Yield: 6 servings.
