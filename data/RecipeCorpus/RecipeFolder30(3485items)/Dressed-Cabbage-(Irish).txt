Categories: Irish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1 pn Nutmeg or mace
1/2 ts Flour
1 x  Pepper
1 x  Cabbage
4 tb Butter
3 tb Bacon stock or water
Shred the cabbage.  Melt half the butter in a heavy pot;  then add the
cabbage and toss until covered with the butter.  Add bacon stock or
water, cover and cook gently for about 20 minutes.  By this time the
liquid should be nearly absorbed, and the cabbage cooked.  Add the
nutmeg or mace, the flour, and stir well;  then add the rest of the
butter and toss until melted into the cabbage.  Add pepper if needed.
