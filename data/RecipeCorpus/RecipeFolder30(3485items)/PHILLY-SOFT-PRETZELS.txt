Title: PHILLY SOFT PRETZELS
Categories: Breads, Snacks
Yield: 1 batch  1 TB dry yeast 1 1/4 c warm water 3-4 c flour 2 ts salt 4 ts baking
soda kosher or margarita salt

Dissolve yeast thoroughly in 1/4 cup warm water.  Mix 3 cups flour
and salt in large bowl.  Add yeast with remaining 1 cup water. Add
enough additional flour to make dough stiff.  Knead 10 minutes or
till dough feels elastic. Form into ball.  Place in bowl and spread
with butter. Cover with towel and let rise till doubled, about 45
minutes. Divide dough into 12 small balls and roll between hands (or
on counter) to form a rope. Form into pretzel shapes, wetting and
pinching ends firmly. Dissolve baking soda in 4 cups water and bring
to a boil. Drop pretzels, a few at a time, in water and boil till
they float to the top, about 1 minute. Remove and drain. Place on
buttered baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and bake at 475 for 15-20
minutes or till golden brown. Place on rack to cool.

I used to make these a lot when my husband had to do field time in the
army.  According to all the guys, they warm up pretty good and are
excellent with some German scharfer senf (sharp/hot mustard).
