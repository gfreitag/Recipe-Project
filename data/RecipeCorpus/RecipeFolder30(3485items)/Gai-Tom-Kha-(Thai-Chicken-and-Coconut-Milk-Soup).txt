Title: Gai Tom Kha (Thai Chicken and Coconut Milk Soup)
Categories: Thai, Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
6    Fresh Serrano chiles,
-sliced into rounds
1 lg Whole chicken breast *
4 tb Fish sauce (nam pla)
5    Fresh Kaffir lime leaves
-(makrut), if available
2    Fresh limes, juice
2 tb Chopped coriander leaves
4 c  Medium coconut milk
1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
3 qt Pieces dried galangal
-(kha), or
6 qt Pieces fresh galangal
4    Stalks fresh lemon grass,
-bruised, cut into 2-inch
-lengths
*  cut into 1/2-inch pieces (with or without bones, see note)

Combine coconut milk, chicken stock, galangal, lemon grass and 4 of
the chiles in a saucepan; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer
for 20 minutes.  Strain stock; discard galangal and lemon grass.
Return stock to a boil, add chicken and simmer until tender, about 2
minutes. Add fish sauce, citrus leaves and remaining chiles.  Stir in
the lime juice. Garnish with coriander.

Serves 6 to 8.

NOTE:  I like to use boned chicken breast if I'm cooking for guests.
For the best flavor, however, use a whole small chicken chopped into
small pieces with the bones; increase the cooking time until chicken
is tender.
