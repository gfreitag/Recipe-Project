Title: Peach-Glazed Chicken Thighs
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 3 servings
2 ts Olive oil
2 ts Honey
1 tb Red wine vinegar
2 tb Sliced scallion green
2 lg Ripe peaches
6    Chicken thighs
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
(2 to 3 Servings)

1. Peel and chop 1 peach and place in a medium bowl.  Using a fork,
mash the peach. Place the chicken thighs in the bowl and toss to coat
well. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 2 hours or
refrigerate for up to 6 hours; return to room temp. before proceeding.

2.  Preheat the oven to 350.  Remove the chicken from the marinade
and pat dry with paper towels.  Season the chicken with the salt and
pepper.

3.  In a large ovenproof skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat.
Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is deep
brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Turn the thighs and place the
skillet in the oven. Bake until tender, about 15 minutes.

4.  Peel and slice the remaining peach.  Remove the chicken thighs
from the skillet.  Pour off any fat from the pan and return the
chicken to the skillet. Place over high heat until the chicken begins
to sizzle.  Add the honey; toss to coat the thighs.  Cook stirring,
until the honey begins to brown and stick to the bottom of the pan,
about 1 minute.  Add the vinegar and peach slices.  Stir to loosen
the brown bits from the bottom of the pan and turn to glaze the
chicken, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Remove the thighs to a platter, place
the peach slices in the middle and garnish with the scallion.

Serve with rice or pasta and garden vegetable salad.
