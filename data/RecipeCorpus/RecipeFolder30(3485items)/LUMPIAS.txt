1 ts Garlic; minced
1 lb Pork, ground
1 pk Mu Shu Pork Wrappers
1    Egg; mixed with
1 tb Flour
Chili Sauce
10 oz Water chestnuts; drained

2    Eggs
1 ts Black Pepper
1 bn Scallion; minced
2    Yellow chili peppers; minced

Combine the first eight ingredients and mix thoroughly. With a
wrapper on a plate in front of you, put about 1 tbl meat on a corner
as though you were going to wrap the meat up in a piece of butcher
paper. Using your fingers, pinch the meat into a cylinder. Bring the
lower corner up over the meat, wrap the sides in, and roll the meat
up around the rest of the wrapper. Secure the edge of the wrapper by
using the egg mixture as glue. Deep fry the lumpias until crispy and
golden brown. Serve at once with chili sauce.
