Title: Crown Roast Of Frankfurters With Baked Beans
Categories: Kids
Yield: 8 servings
3 pk (12 Oz) Frankfurters
-
(about 21)
3 cn Baked Beans, (16-oz cans)
1/2 c  Onion, chopped
1/3 c  Packed Dark Brown Sugar
2 ts Dijon Mustard
1. Preheat oven to 400 F. In a medium saucepan, combine baked beans,
onion, brown sugar, and mustard. Stir until well mixed. Cook over
medium heat, stirring occasionally, until beans are hot, 10 to 15
mins.

2. Meanwhile, rinse frankfurters and blot dry with paper towels.
Spear 3 frankfurters together by pushing a toothpick horizontally
through upper 1/3 of franks. Repeat with remaining frankfurters.

3. Place a 6-inch-tall 1 1/2- to 2-qt baking dish about 4 1/2 inches
in diameter (such as a bean pot) on an ovenproof serving platter. Lean
frankfurters, skewered ends up, around outside edge of bean pot. Tie a
piece of kitchen string around center of franks to secure them in a
circle. Remove toothpicks.

4. Transfer hot beans from saucepan to pot in center of franks and
place platter and all in oven. Bake until frankfurters are golden
brown and beans are bubbly, about 25 mins. To serve, spoon beans
directly from pot and use tongs to remove frankfurters.

Note: Use longer bun-size frankfurters. To form the crown, you'll
need 7 long toothpicks and a piece of white kitchen string.
