Title: Pasta with Tofu
Categories: Side dish, Pasta, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 servings
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 tb White vinegar
Water, as necessary
1 c  Durum semolina
1 c  Whole-wheat flour
1 pn Salt
1/4 c  Tofu, mashed
Combine the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl & mix.  Add the
remaining ingredients & enough water until you can form a ball of
dough. Knead vigorously for several minutes until the dough is soft &
elasticky. Shape into a ball, cover with a damp cloth & set aside to
rest for a couple of hours.

Cut the rested dough into 4 portions, & roll out each portion until
it is very thin & then cut into the desired shape.  Or, put the dough
through a pasta maker until the required thickness is attained & then
cut.

Cook pasta in lots of boiling water that has been slightly salted for
3 or 4 minutes.  Drain & serve with a pasta sauce or with fresh herbs.
