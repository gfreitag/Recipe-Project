CLASSIC ENGLISH MUFFINS

...................................................................
Make your own English Muffins, sprinkled with cornmeal to enhance
their flavor. Spread muffins with maragarine, chopped dill, and a
dash of garlic, or use the Pizza Sauce listed here to create a mock
pizza.
...................................................................

Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon of sugar in 1/2 cup of the water. Let
stand 5 minutes until foamy. In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups
of flour, 2 tablespoons of sugar, remaining water, yeast mixture,
maragarine, egg and salt. Beat at medium speed until the dough leaves
the side of the bowl. Beat in remaining flour until smooth. Knead by
hand or with a dough hook for 10 minutes. Dough should be soft, but
not sticky. Place in a greased bowl, turning to grease all over.
Cover witha clean damp towel and let rise until double in bulk -- 1
1/2 hours. Punch down. Pat or press carefully on a lightly floured
surface. With a cookie cutter, cut into 3-inch rounds and place on a
greased baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover and let rise
until double in bulk -- about 1 1/2 hours. Cook on ahot greased
griddle pan over medium heat for 7 minutes per side. When ready to
eat, place in a preheated 300 F oven to warm for 5 minutes.

Yields 15 muffins.
