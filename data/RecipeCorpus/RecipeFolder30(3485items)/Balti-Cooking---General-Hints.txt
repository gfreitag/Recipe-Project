Title: Balti Cooking - General Hints
Categories: Information, Indian, Balti
Yield: 1 info sheet  A Balti Meal
============

A Balti meal is fun with a number of main dishes. The more people who
are eating a meal, the easier this is. With four people, you might
serve one meat, one poultry, one fish or shellfish, and two vegetable
Balti dishes, plus rice, bread and chutneys. Allow approximately 2 oz
(50g) (uncooked weight) of each of the 5 dishes for each person, plus
2-3 oz (50-75g) extra. For rice allow 2oz (50g) dry uncooked weight
per person for a small portion, 3 oz (75g) for larger appetites. For
lentils, allow 1oz (25g) uncooked weight, minimum, per person.
If all this sounds complicated, it isn't really. as always, common
sense should prevail.
As much of the enjoyment of Balti eating is to mix-and-match
combinations of items (see below), I have adopted a portions formula
in this book which should help you. All meat, chicken and fish or
shellfish recipes are given as four person servings. Vegetables, on
the other hand, are given as single-portion servings. Some items
which you may wish to use a lot of - par cooked meat, lentils etc -
are also given in bulk ten-portion recipes. Using some fresh and some
frozen, will save you time, smells and multiple washing up.

Balti Combination Dishes
========================

The majority of recipes in this book are complete in themselves and
can be served as they are with some bread and/or rice.
For the adventurous, however, the fun has only just begun! The
beauty of Balti is that the dishes are designed to be combined in any
way that takes your fancy or suits the contents of your fridge or
freezer. This can be as simple as adding some plain vegetables to a
particular Balti dish, or could involve combining two, three or more
given Balti dishes into one spectacular combination Balti dish.
There are no rules. The only thing to remember is that you should
aim to have 4 portions of main ingredients per dish to serve 4
people. the main ingredients can be meat, poultry, fish or shellfish,
vegetables or paneer (Indian cheese).
So for example, if you decided to combine Balti Turkey Curry with
some celery (or indeed any other vegetable from chapter 5), for every
1 portion of cooked celery (6oz/175g raw weight) added to the recipe
on p 72, you would reduce the raw turkey by the same amount.
Similarly, if you wanted to combine Balti Prawns (US shrimps) with
Balti keema, you would need only half quantities of each recipe
(since both recipes make 4 portions) to serve 4 people.
For tips and suggestions on combining actual Balti dishes, see
below.

Serving
=======

Traditionally, the various dishes should come to table in a blackened
well-used Balti pot - a two handled wok like pan otherwise known as a
karahi or kari, korai, kadai or kodoi. It is a circular hemispherical
all purpose cooking pot used for stir frying, simmering, frying and
deep frying. Sizes can range from massive (over 3ft 3 in (1m) in
diameter) to small (as little as 3 1/4 in 8 cm).
As for eating Balti, the traditional way in the Balti lands (and in
much of India and Pakistan also, for that matter - IMH ) and at the
Balti house is to use no cutlery. The chapatti or naan is the
traditional 'implement'. Break off a smallish wedge and using your
right hand only, scoop up the food with the bread and pop it and the
bread into your mouth. After practice it becomes quite easy and not
at all messy (true, I've been eating curries for years like that
IMH). Leave enough bread to do the traditional wipe-up of the dish at
the end. For the faint-hearted, a fork and dessertspoon are the only
acceptable cutlery. A finger bowl and ample napkins are mandatory.
And plenty of finger lickin' is expected of you!

Balti combination Dishes
========================
'If you can't find your favourite combination on our menu, our chef
will be delighted to cook it especially for you', so says the menu
for the aptly named _I am the King of Balti_ in Birmingham. With over
60 Balti dishes on the menu, you would not imagine more possible
combinations could exist. As I've mentioned elsewhere, it is the norm
to combine different ingredients and dishes in Balti cooking.
This suits the home cook very well, as you can simply use
ingredients you have to hand. Balti afficionados  call this
"mix-'n'-match". It means you can serve Balti "anything" with
"anything". Balti meat or Balti chicken are perfectly acceptable of
course, but so are Balti meat & mushrooms of Balti chicken and
mushrooms. Or you could have Balti meat with mushrooms and dhal, or
even Balti meat with mushroom, dhal and spinach. I'm sure you've got
the picture. the permutations are almost infinite.
Some traditional Balti-house combinations make good reading (and
eating!) and I've included them. Balti Tropical, for example is equal
amounts of meat, chicken and prawns. Balti Tropical Plus adds keema
(mince or ground meat). Balti Tropical Vegetable combines any six
vegetables of your choice. Bhoti Balti is equal amounts of lamb,
chicken and mixed vegetables.
The main thing to keep in mind is the total weight of ingredients.
the total approximate weight of all your (raw) principal ingredients
should be around 1 1/2 lb to serve four people. So in the case of
Balti Tropical, the raw prepared meat, chicken and prawns will each
weight 8 oz.
To help you work out quantities, all recipes state how many portions
they make. If you require only one portion of a recipe that makes 4
portions, you will find it more practical to cook the complete recipe
and freeze the surplus. Some suggestions:- Balti Meat & Chicken Balti
Bhola Balti Balti
Tomato, Celery, corn & snow pea
Tropical Balti Tropical Plus  Prawns & Keema
Chicken & Egg Lentils & Potato
Lobia Beans, Mushrooms & Spinach. Submitted By IAN HOARE   On
