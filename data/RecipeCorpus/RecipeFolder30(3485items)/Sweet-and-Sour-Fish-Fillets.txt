Categories: Fish, Asian, Wok
Yield: 6 servings
1/3 c  Cider vinegar
1/2 c  Pineapple chunks
1/2    Carrot, shredded
2/3 c  Sweet pickles
1    Tomato, cut into wedges
1 1/2 tb Corn starch, dissolved in
1/2 c  Water
1 lb Ocean perch
Corn starch
1/2 c  Flour
1    Egg
1/2 c  Water
Salt
Oil for deep frying
1/3 c  Brown sugar
1. Slice ocean perch fillets into pieces about 2x1". Dredge in corn
starch and allow to dry slightly on wax paper. Make a batter of about
1/2 cup flour, 1 egg, 1/2 cup water, and salt

2. In a separate small pot, dissolve 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup
cider vinegar over medium heat. Stir up corn starch in 1/2 cup water,
add to pot. Stir thoroughly. Add pineapple, carrot, sweet pickles,
and tomato. Cook 3-5 minutes until sauce is clear and not cloudy.
Reserve.

3. Pour oil halfway up wok. Turn heat on highest point. When you
think oil is hot enough for deep frying, take a piece of bread crust
and place in oil to see if it is ready. If the bread crust is not
browned readily, then oil is not ready. If the bread crust is medium
brown, then oil is ready. If the bread crust is a dark brown, then
turn oil off and allow it to cool at least 5 minutes before using. Be
sure and retest oil before deep frying anything in it. When the oil
is ready, place 8-10 pieces of fish in batter. Take a pair of
chopsticks or fork and carefully lift pieces of fish from batter into
oil. At first the fish will sink to bottom of oil. They will rise.
When the fish is risen, deep fry about 4 minutes, 2 minutes on each
side. Remove fish to paper toweling to drain excess oil, then arrange
fish on serving platter. repeat procedure until all fish is deep
fried. Pour sweet and sour sauce over fish.

NOTE: Shrimp or chicken are good substituted for the fish in this
recipe.
