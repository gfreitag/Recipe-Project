Title: Potato Griddle Scones^
Categories: Potato, Homemade
Yield: 1 servings
1    Egg, beaten
1 c  Milk, about
3/4 c  Cold mashed potatoes
2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
4 ts Baking powder
2 tb Shortening
Sift flour, salt and baking powder together. Rub in the shortening
lightly, add the potatoes and mix to a soft dough with the egg and
milk. Roll out about 3/4" thick, cut into 3 cornered cakes and cook
on hot, well greased griddle. Many of the recipes in this collection
did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as
they appear in the book, typos and all.
