Yes, fried milk - it's a specialty of Spain.  This recipe is from
Posada de la Villa, in Madrid. In a large pot with a heavy bottom,
heat the milk with the vanilla bean just until it starts to boil.
Remove from the heat and set aside. In a medium bowl, beat the sugar
and one egg with a wooden spoon until well blended. Add the 4 1/2
tablespoons flour and the cornstarch; mix well. Remove the vanilla
bean from the milk and bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat and
slowly add the milk to the flour mixture, stirring all the while.
Pour the mixture back into the pot and bring to a boil again; stir
constantly as you let it boil until it begins to thicken a bit (about
6 to 8 minutes).   Watch it carefully so it doesn't burn. Pour onto a
small greased baking dish or metal tray.  The mixture should be about
3/4 inch deep. Cool in the refrigerator. Cut into 3-inch squares. Put
1 cup flour into a shallow bowl, and the 3 eggs into another. Pass
the squares through the remaining flour, shake off the excess, then
pass through the beaten eggs; gently fry on both sides in vegetable
oil until golden. Place in the middle of a metal dish, sprinkle with
cinnamon and confectioners' sugar, and serve warm. Serves 4-6 Source:
