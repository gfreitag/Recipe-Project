Categories: Holiday, Desserts
Yield: 1 batch
MMMMM---------------------------TOOLS--------------------------------
Wooden skewers or candy fork
Cooling rack
Small ice cream scoop
2    Jellyroll pans, lined with
.  wax paper
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
. large enough to roll the
. ice cream balls
Confectioner's sugar (opt)
Rose petals (opt)
1 pt Ice cream (your favorite)
1 lb Chocolate, good-quality
1/2 c  Heavy cream
8 oz Chopped nuts, coconut,
. jimmies, etc.. in bowls
**  Preparation  **

Allow the ice cream to sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes to
soften.  Prepare truffles by scooping out balls of ice cream and
placing them on a jellyroll pan lined with wax paper.  Place the pan
on a level spot in the freezer.  Freeze the ice cream balls until
hardened.

Chop the chocolate coarsely and place in a clean, dry glass bowl.
(Using a glass bowl free of oil or water will keep the chocolate from
seizing. When chocolate seizes, it loses its sheen and shrinks into a
hardened, grainy mass.)

Add cream, if desired.  Cream gives chocolate a softer consistency,
so when it sits at room temperature, the shell doesn't become
rock-hard.

Microwave on High (100 percent power) for 1 minute.  Stir thoroughly.
It will still be lumpy.  Microwave on High for 30 seconds more and
stir again. Repeat this step until the chocolate is smooth. Chocolate
that has been microwaved requires more stirring than chocolate heated
on a stove. When you feel you have stirred it enough, stir a little
bit more. Taking this extra time will help you keep the chocolate
from burning.

**  Assembly  **

You may use a fork or a skewer to dip the balls of frozen ice cream
into the chocolate.  Although messy, using clean hands is the
preferred method.

Set up you work space close to the freezer.  Place the cooling rack
on the second lined jellyroll pan on a level spot in the freezer;
this is where you will put your dipped truffles.  Line up your nut
bowl and then your chocolate.

Remove an ice cream ball from the freezer.  If it is to be rolled in
nuts, roll it now, using slightly firm pressure and tossing between
each hand so any loose nuts come off.  Stick a skewer into the ball
and drop it down into the melted chocolate and coat thoroughly. Shake
lightly and put on the cooling rack.  If you want to put the nuts on
the outside, roll the truffles in nuts after dipping them in
chocolate and then put them in the freezer.  Depending on the
chocolate you use or how many layers you are coating, you might need
to put the truffles in the freezer for a little while between steps
to ensure that the truffles do not lose their shape.

**  To Serve  **

Remove from the freezer and let sit at room temperature for about 10
minutes.  Garnish as desired with a light dusting of confectioner's
sugar and perhaps rose petals.
