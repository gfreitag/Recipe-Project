Pound the chicken breasts almost paper-thin. Saute quickly in butter
in a very hot pan about 30 seconds on each side, just until the meat
takes on a little color. Set the breasts aside and keep warm.

Deglaze the pan with the stock and the wine. Reduce by half. Add the
creme fraiche and grapefruit juice, and reduce to the consistency of
very heavy cream. Add the salt, pepper and ginger.

Meanwhile, heat the grapefruit sections friefly under the broiler.
Spread a pool of the sauce on each of 8 plates and lay the chicken
breasts on top. Arrange the grapefruit sections over the chicken.
Sprinkle the candied ginger, grapefruit peels, and chives over the
sections.
