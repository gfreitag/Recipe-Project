soft dough. Cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for 6 to 12 hours.

While dough is chilling, punch down several times.

Allow dough to come to room temperature.  Divide dough into 2 parts.
Roll each part into a 10 1/2 x14-inch rectangle.  Cut into 3 1/2 inch
squares. Place on greased baking sheets.  Cut each square diagonally
from each corner to within about 1/2 inch of center.  Place rounded

tablespoon water slightly beaten).  Bring moistened points toward
center, gently twist and pinch to fasten together.  Top each center
with a small piece of dough, about 1/2 inch in diameter, or use a
candied cherry for extra decoration.
