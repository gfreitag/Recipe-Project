Title: Roasted Florida Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
3    Heaping tbsp. flour
6    Cloves garlic,peeled
3    To 4 - cups chicken broth
Freshly ground pepper
3 sm Broiling chickens,quartered
Seasoning salt
Red pepper flakes
Juice of 1/2 fresh lime
1/2 c  Unsalted butter
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Sprinkle salt over top and underside of
chicken. Lay chicken pieces skin side up in single layer in shallow
roasting pans. Sprinkle very lightly with red pepper flakes and lime
juice. Set aside.

In a large saucepan, melt butter over low heat and add flour slowly,
stirring constantly. Allow to brown, slowly; do not let burn. Add
whole peeled garlic cloves as paste begins to turn creamy golden.
Continue until paste is light brown in color. If any of the garlic
cloves show over browned edges,remove them. You will have the value
of the flavor anyway.

Check seasoning, add salt and freshly ground white or black pepper.
Add chicken broth to paste slowly, stirring constantly with a wire
whisk until blended and the consistency of cream soup. Check
seasoning carefully to avoid over salting.

Spoon sauce over chicken, completely covering edges. Put chicken legs
in oven first. They take a little longer to cook. Five minutes later
add breasts. Baste with sauce in pan every 5 to 10 minutes. Chicken
must be kept moist. Bake a total of 45 to 60 minutes.

Serves 6.
