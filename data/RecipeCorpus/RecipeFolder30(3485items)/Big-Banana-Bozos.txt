These nutty crunchies are fortified with brewer's yeast for extra
protein to rev up your motor, and blackstrap molasses for
blood-enriching iron.

In a bowl, mix together the flours, wheat germ, yeast, milk powder,
cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg.  Set aside.

In food processor, blender, or mixing bowl combine oil, molasses,
honey, egg, and mashed banana, and mix until light and fluffy.  Add
the dry ingredients and process until combined.  Stir in the nuts,
seeds, and carob chips or raisins.

Preheat oven to 325F.

Drop the batter by tablespoonfuls onto two cookie sheets lined with
parchment paper or greased with a few drops of liquid lecithin and
oil. Top each cookie with several peanut halves or carob chips.  Bake
for 12 to 15 minutes or until firm.  Transfer cookies to wire rack to
cool.

( Tiff's note: I found that the batter for these was very thin)

Approximately 80 calories each.
