Note:  Most supermarkets carry salsas in varying degrees of hotness.

BARBECUE SAUCE: Combine all the ingredients in a medium-size bowl, and
whisk until the sauce is well blended. Adjust seasonings to taste.

Makes 3 cups.

RIBS: 1. Combine all the braising liquid ingredients in a large pot.
Stir well, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. 2. Add the ribs,
and simmer until tender but not falling apart, about 1 hour and 45
minutes. When done, carefully transfer the ribs to a baking sheet. 3.
Combine all the spice mixture ingredients in a medium-size bowl, and
stir to form a paste. (Add more beer if it is too dry.) 4. Rub the
paste over all surfaces of the ribs.  Wrap each slab in aluminum
foil, dull side out, and refrigerate until ready to cook. (These can
be prepared up to 4 days in advance.) 5. Preheat the oven to 400F,
and prepare hot coals for grilling. Place the rack 3 to 4 inches from
the heat. 6. Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and arrange the
ribs on the foil. Coat the ribs with 2 cups of the barbecue sauce,
and bake on the center rack of the oven for 10 minutes. 7. Transfer
the ribs to the grill, and cook long enough to char. Serve
immediately, with the remaining 1 cup barbecue sauce on the side.

4 portions.

Author's note:  One of America's finest chefs, Jimmy Schmidt -- of the
Rattlesnake Club in Denver -- has made these one of his signature
dishes. The three sauces created deep hot flavor -- these are real
mean western ribs.
