1    Lemon, juice of
1 qt Ripe cherries

Stone cherries and mash through a colander. Boil water and sugar and
add to cherries. Add lemon juice, stir well and chill. Serve partly
frozen or with shaved ice. In hot weather, this will really cool you
off! Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts
or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the
book, typos and all.
