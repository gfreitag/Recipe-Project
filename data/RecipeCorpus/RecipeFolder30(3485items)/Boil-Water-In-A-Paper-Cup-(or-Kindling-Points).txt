Title: Boil Water In A Paper Cup (or Kindling Points)
Categories: Kids
Yield: 1 experiment
Open fire or Candle flame
1    Unwaxed paper cup
Water to fill cup
What to do:  Fill the unwaxed paper cup with water and set it over
the fire or candle flame.  The cup will NOT burn, even when the water
starts to boil.

What happens:  For the paper to burn, it must reach its kindling
point. The water draws heat away from he paper and prevents the paper
from reaching the kindling point.  When the water boils away, the cup
will burn.

NOTE:  Please use a paper cup that is unwaxed.  If you don't the wax
will catch on fire.
