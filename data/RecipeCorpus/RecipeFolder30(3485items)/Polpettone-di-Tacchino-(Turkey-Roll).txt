Title: Polpettone di Tacchino (Turkey Roll)
Categories: Meats, Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1    Egg, lightly beaten
Chicken broth
2 tb Pistachio nuts
2    Sage leaves
1 ts Rosemary leaves
6 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1 lb Whole turkey breast
2    Garlic cloves, minced
2 tb Chopped parsley
Salt
Fresh ground black pepper
3/4 lb Ground dark turkey meat
2/3 c  Seasoned bread crumbs
Slice turkey breast and open it like a book. Flatten with blade of
large knife or with meat mallet until it forms a large sheet.
Sprinkle with garlic, parsley and salt and pepper on both sides. Set
aside.

Place ground meat, bread crumbs, eggs, 2 tablespoons chicken broth and
pistachios in a bowl. Add a half teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper
and mix.

Spread mixture over open turkey breast, then roll up the short way,
as you would for a jelly roll. Tie with string.

Place sage, rosemary and olive oil in a skillet. Brown turkey roll on
all sides. Add the wine and raise the heat to let alcohol evaporate.
Add a half cup of broth and simmer, tightly covered, for about two
hours, turning only once. Add more broth if necessary.

Remove string before slicing. Serve with grapan juices strained over
the slices.
