dish.  Spread half the rice in the bottom of the baking dish. Top
with all the mushrooms.  Sprinkle 1 c Parmesan over the mushrooms and
top with the remaining rice.  Whisk the cream, eggs and nutmeg
together and pour evenly over the rice.  Sprinkle with the remaining
1 c Parmesan. Bake until the top is puffed and brown, about 30
minutes. Let cool several minutes before serving. From The Silver
