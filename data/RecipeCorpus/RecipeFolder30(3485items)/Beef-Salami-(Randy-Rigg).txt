Mix well and refrigerate, covered well.  The next day knead well,
like for bread.  Do this for three days.  On the 5 th day, knead and
form into 4 rolls.  Place on broiler tray and bake uncovered for 8
hours at 150 degrees.  The salami forms it's own casing.  Slice to
desired thickness when cold. Source:
