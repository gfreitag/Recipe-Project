Title: Onion Upside Down Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Vegetables
Yield: 3 servings
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1    Egg, beaten
1 1/4 c  Milk
6 md Vadaila onions
3 tb Butter
2 c  Flour, sifted then measured
4 ts Baking powder
Slice onions and saute in butter until yellow and soft. Let cool a
little. Keep in slices if possible.  Make a batter by adding egg and
milk to dry ingredients.  Batter should be a little thinner than
biscuit dough. Spread onions in a greased baking dish.  Pour dough on
top. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  I also sprinkle about
1/2 cup of grated colby cheese on top before putting in the oven.
