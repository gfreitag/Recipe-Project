A Parsee favourite, this is a superb recipe which competes well with
the Spanish omelette. Sereve it with salad or even with chips. It's
delicious. The ingredients given are to serve two, but for four or
more, increase the filling quantities, but cook the omelette in
batches of four eggs at a time. A larger omelette is harder to
control.

Make the filling first. Core and seed the bell pepper and cut into
thin julienne strips. Blanch these a couple of minutes and refresh.
Fry the onion with the garlic and chilli in a little oil until light
golden. Add the spices and fry gently for a further 10 minutes. Add
the cubed cooked potato and the pepper and fry a further 10-15
minutes.. Salt to taste and set aside.   (Can be prepared in advance
to this point).

To make the omelette, heat the ghee and beat eggs lightly with a wire
whisk. Pour eggs into pan and cook on low to medium heat until just
firm, then turn over. Spread with filling and cook till firm, then
fold omelette over the filling. Sprinkle with coriander (cilantro) or
parsley as a garnish.
