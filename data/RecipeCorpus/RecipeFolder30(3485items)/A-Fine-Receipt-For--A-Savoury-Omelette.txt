============================
A FINE RECEIPT FOR A
-SAVOURY OMELETTE
Break four eggs, beat them up till thin enough to pass through a hair
sieve, then beat them until up till perfectly smooth and thin; a small
omelette frying-pan is necessary for cooking it well. Disolve in a
piece of butter, about an ounce and a half, pour in the egg, and as
soon as it rises and is firm, slide it onto a warm plate and fold it
over; it should only be fried on one side, and finely minced herbs
should be sprinkled over the the unfried sie with pepper and salt. A
salamander is frequently held over the unfried side of the omelette
to take off the rawness it may otherwise have. From: The Jewish
Manual by "A Lady". Intro. by Chaim Raphael Transcribed By: S.
