The Fog City Diner was one of the places that came along with the
diner revival of a few years back.  It is, or was, a trendy place
over in the City.  I think it may have closed after the '89 quake,
but I'm not sure about that.

Combine the tomatoes, sugar, vinegar, garlic, salt, pickling spice,
cinnamon, dry mustard and pepper in a large, heavy stainless steel or
enameled saucepan.  Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat,
stirring occasionally.  Reduce the heat and simmer the ketchup,
uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring frequently.  Remove the ketchup
from the heat and let it cool a few minutes.

Force the ketchup through a fine sieve to strain it, pressing down
hard on the solids.  Rinse out the saucepan and return the ketchup to
a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently.  Reduce the heat and
simmer the ketchup, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes.  (Even if
the ketchup seems thin, do not cook it any longer, as the thickening
power of the cornstarch lessens with prolonged cooking.  The ketchup
will thicken a bit more upon cooling.) Remove the ketchup from the
heat and let it cool to room temperature. Store the tomato ketchup,
covered, in the refrigerator for up to a month.

Makes about 5 cups.
