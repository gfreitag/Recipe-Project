Title: Garlic and Yogurt Veal Ribs
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Crushed red pepper
Salt and pepper to taste
4 1/2 lb Veal ribs
2    Garlic cloves, minced
1/4 c  Virgin olive oil
1 c  Unflavored yogurt
This one seems East Indian in inspiration what with the yogurt and red
pepper.

Combine garlic with oil, yogurt, red pepper and salt and pepper to
taste; marinate veal ribs in mixture for at least 1 hour.

Bake in a 350F oven for 40 minutes, or microwave at full power for 7
minutes per side.

Heat a charcoal grill until coals are white-hot, or preheat a gas
grill on high for 5 minutes with lid closed.

Grill ribs about 4 inches from hot coals.  They will take about 5
minutes per side.

Serves 4.
