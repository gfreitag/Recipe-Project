2    Cloves garlic, halved
12 sm Slices of crusty bread

These can be made while standing around the BBQ or on the stove
inside. Either way these simple nibbles are very easy and a definite
crowd pleaser. Brush both sides of bread with olive oil. Place on bbq
or under grill until both sides are golden brown.

Rub toasted bread with garlic and serve plain or with any of these
toppings:

*    Tomato, Sage and Red Onion, * Mushroom and Capsicum, * Zucchini
and Fetta (See separate recipes).
