* chicken may be skinned

1. Saute onion, green onions, bell pepper and jalapeno with the cumin
in vegetable oil until onion is softened.  Add the bread and
tortillas and cook together over medium heat, stirring for a few
minutes so that the bread and tortillas do not burn.  Add the
tomatillos and broth and reduce heat.  Let simmer for 10 to 15
minutes, uncovered, or until tomatillos are tender.  If using canned
tomatillos, cook for only 5 minutes.

2. Add the chicken pieces and cilantro and continue cooking, covered
over low heat, until chicken is tender, about 40 minutes.  Season
with lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste.

3. Serve immediately, topped with spoonfuls of cool sour cream.
