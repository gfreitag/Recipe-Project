Categories: Desserts
Yield: 9 servings
-sliced fruit, or stemmed
-berries
1/2    To 3/4 cup sugar
2 tb Flour
1/4 lb Butter, melted
1 c  Flour
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1    Egg, beaten
5    To 6 cups peeled, seeded,
I love cobblers, crisps, etc., but never make them.  This one may
change my mind.  What can you say about a recipe that starts like
this?

"...When I called her, she read me the recipe from a small black cook
that contains, she says, the recipes that have no peer, the benchmark
recipes. Willie's Crisp is part of this collection, and although I
have no idea who Willie is, I do know that his is the only crisp I've
ever had that was crisp. It is perfect on top of fruit or berries."

Preheat the oven to 375F. Have ready an 8 x 8-inch baking dish (no
need to butter it). Put 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, the baking powder
and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir to mix well.  Make a well in
the center of the dry ingredients and add the beaten egg. (Don't add
the egg now unless you are going to bake this right away. The sugar
will begin to melt, and the mixture won't crumble and spread
properly.) Stir mixture with a fork. It should be crumbly; if it
seems too dry, add a little more egg. Put the fruit or berries into
another mixing bowl. Stir together the 2 tablespoons flour and sugar
to taste. Add to the fruit and toss lightly to coat. Spoon fruit into
the baking dish and spread evenly. Sprinkle the crisp mixture evenly
over the top. Drizzle the melted butter evenly over the crisp
mixture. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the topping is golden.
Serve warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
