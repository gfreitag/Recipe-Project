Title: Angel Food Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 12 servings
1 1/2 ts Vanilla Extract Or Almond
Extract
Powdered Sugar -- optional
Fresh Strawberries, Sliced
Optional
1 c  Cake Flour -- sifted
1 1/4 c  Granulated Sugar
12    Egg Whites -- at room
Temperature
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Cream Of Tartar
Sift together flour and 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar; sift again
and set aside.

In large bowl of an electric mixer, beat egg whites on high speed
until foamy. Add salt and cream of tartar and continue beating until
mixture holds soft peaks. Add remaining sugar, 2 Tbs at a time,
beating well after each addition, until mixture holds stiff glossy
peaks.

With a rubber spatula, fold in vanilla. Sprinkle in flour mixture,
about 1/4 cup at a time, gently folding in each just until blended.
Turn batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan with a removable
bottom; gently smooth top.

Slide spatula down outside edge of batter and run around pan to
eliminate air bubbles.

Bake in a 375 F oven until cake is golden and springs back when
lightly pressed (about 35 mins). Invert pan on a funnel or pop bottle
to keep cake from shrinking; let cool completely. Remove from pan and
place on a cake plate or platter. Dust with powdered sugar and
decorate with strawberries, if desired. Slice with an angel food cake
knife or serrated knife. Makes 12 servings.
