Title: To Draw Good Gravy

MMMMM---------------------TO DRAW GOOD GRAVY--------------------------
Cut some gravy beef into small pieces, put them in a jar, and set it
in a saucepan of cold water to boil gently for seven or eight hours,
adding from time to time, more water as the original quantity boils
away. The gravy thus made will be the essence of the meat, and in
cases where nutriment is required in the smallest compass, will be of
great service. Soups are stronger when the meat is cut, and garvy
drawn before water is added. From: The Jewish Manual by "A Lady".
