Title: Delicate Pancakes^
Categories: Pcake/waffl, Homemade
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Milk
2 tb Butter
4    Eggs
2 tb Flour
Separate eggs, beat the whites till stiff. Beat yolks thoroughly, add
flour and salt. When well mixed, stir in the milk. At the last
moment, fold in the whites. Melt butter in a large skillet, pour in
batter and cook over a moderately hot fire until it begins to set.
Then transfer the pan to a hot oven to finish cooking. Turn onto a
hot dish and serve with applesauce. Many of the recipes in this
collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed
them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
