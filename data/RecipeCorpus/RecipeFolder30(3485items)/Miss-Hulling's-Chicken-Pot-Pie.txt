Title: Miss Hulling's Chicken Pot Pie
Categories: Poultry, Casseroles
Yield: 6 servings
1    Recipe pastry
2 md Potatoes, cooked and cubed
2    Ribs celery
2    Carrots
1    5 pound stewing hen, cut up
5 c  Water
1 sm Onion
1/2 ts Salt
Simmer chicken in water with onion, celery, carrots and salt until
tender (about 3 hours).  Remove chicken from bones and cut in cubes,
discarding the skin.  Strain broth and measure, adding water to make
3 cups.

Thicken broth with 4 Tablespoons flour mixed with 1/4 cup water.
Adjust seasonings with a dash of white pepper and more salt if
necessary.  Add chicken, carrots (cubed) and cubed potatoes.  Spoon
into 6 individual casserole dishes or a 2-quart casserole.

Roll pastry about 1/4-inch thick and top the casserole, sealing the
edges. Make several slashes in the pastry to allow the steam to
escape.  Bake in a hot oven (400 degrees F.) for about 30 minutes or
until golden brown.

Helpful Hints:  Biscuit dough (rolled thin) or individual biscuits
may be used for the topping.  I also add defrosted frozen peas, to
add more color.
