Title: Sally Washington's Chicken Dressing
Categories: Poultry, Dress/stuff
Yield: 6 servings
Milk or water
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Thyme
3 c  Broken toasted stale bread
1 sm Onion, chopped
4 tb Butter
Salt to taste

Toast about three and one-half rather thick slices of stale bread and
break into small pieces.  Dampen with milk or water so that the bread
crumbs are soft but not mushy.  Melt two tablespoons of butter in a
frying pan and mix with the bread.  Season with the pepper, thyme and
salt.  Melt the remaining butter and fry the onions in it until they
are brown.  Then add the bread and let it brown, stirring frequently.

This amount will stuff one five-pound chicken.  Sauteing the dressing
gives it an unusual flavor which is well worth the extra effort in
preparation.
