SWEET DOUGH: In a large bowl, stir together 1 cup all-purpose flour,
1 cup whole-wheat flour, yeast, cinnamon, and salt. In a small
saucepan, heat and stir milk and fructose until warm (120~ to 130~).
Stir into flour mixture. Add egg whites. With electric mixer, beat on
low until blended. Increase to high and beat 3 minutes. Stir in
remaining 1 cup whole-wheat flour and enough all-purpose flour to
make a soft dough. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour on work
surface and knead dough for 6 to 8 minutes, adding flour as needed to
produce a smooth and elastic dough. Shape into a ball and place in a
large bowl coated with no-stick spray. Lightly coat the top with more
spray. Cover and let rise, draft-free, 1 hour, or until doubled.
Punch down dough and divide in half. Cover and let rest 10 minutes.
Spray two 9 x 1 1/2-inch round baking pans with no-stick spray; set
aside. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour on work surface. Roll
half the dough to a 12 x 10-inch rectangle. Repeat with other half.

PECAN FILLING: Brush each rectangle with 1 1/2 tablespoons syrup. In a
small bowl, mix fructose and cinnamon. Sprinkle this and 1/3 cup
pecans over the dough pieces. Roll each piece, starting at long side,
to form a cylinder. Pinch seams to seal and cut each roll into 12
pieces.

PECAN TOPPING: In a small saucepan, melt margarine and stir in brown
sugar and syrup. Spread mixture in pans and sprinkle with 1 cup
pecans. Position dough pieces, cut side down, in pans. Cover and let
rise 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375~. After dough has doubled, bake
for 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in pans 10 minutes, then invert onto
platters. Keep pans on rolls for 1 minute, then remove.
