Title: White Fluffy Icing
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 3 servings
2    Egg whites
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 c  White Karo syrup
2 tb Water
Blend together in a small saucepan sugar, syrup and water.  Boil
rapidly till a few drops form a soft ball or spins a thread when
dropped into cold water.  Remove from heat.  Start beating egg white
immediately in a small mixing bowl.  Beat until stiff enough to hold
a peak. Pour hot syrup slowly in beaten egg whites, beating
constantly with electric mixer until mixture stands in stiff peaks.
