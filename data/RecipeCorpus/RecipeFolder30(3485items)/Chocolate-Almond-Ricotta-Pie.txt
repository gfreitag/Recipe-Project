Categories: Desserts, Pie/tart, Chocolate, Nuts/grains
Yield: 12 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 tb Butter or margarine, melted
-and cooled
1 ea Egg; lightly beaten
1 c  Graham cracker crumbs   :)
-about 12 squares
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/2 c  Blanched almonds
15 oz Container part-skim ricotta
1/2 ts Almond extract
Chocolate bits and almonds
-for garnish (optional)
1/2 ea Envelope unflavored gelatin
-(1-1/2 tsp)
1 c  Milk (skim or 1% OK);
-divided
1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate bits
To prepare the Crust:
Combine the crumbs, sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl.

Combine the butter or margarine and the egg, and add this to the
crumb mixture, mixing the ingredients well.

Press the mixture onto the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate.
Bake the crust in a preheated 350 degree F oven for 10 minutes. Set
the crust aside to cool.

To Make the Filling:

In a medium bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over 1/4 cup of the milk,
and let the mixture stand for 5 minutes. Heat the rest of the milk
(but do not boil it), and add it to the gelatin mixture. Cool the
mixture, and chill it until the mixture thickens to the consistency
of yogurt.

In a blender or food processor, whirl the 1/2 cup chocolate bits
and 1/2 cup almonds for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the ricotta and almond
extract, and process the mixture again. (You will probably have to
scrape down the sides of the container and re-process). Transfer the
mixture to a large bowl.

Beat the milk-gelatin mixture with an electric beater until it is
light and fluffy. Fold this into the ricotta mixture, combining the
ingredients well. Pour the filling into the prepared crust, and chill
the pie for 2 hours or more. Garnish the pie with chocolate bits and
almonds, if desired.
