HITACHI/REGAL

Place all ingredients into pan according to manufacturer's directions.
Press Start.

**MY NOTES**  I tried this using margarine and regular all purpose
flour. It comes out a nice brown color, but somehow I thought I would
see some oatmeal flakes somewhere in the loaf, but didn't. Tastes
great. Makes nice toast and hearty sandwich bread.
