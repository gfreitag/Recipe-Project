Categories: Meats, Main dish, Alcohol
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 c  Dry sherry
1/2 c  Ketchup
1 ts Dried marjoram
8 lb Leg of lamb
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/2 c  Red currant jelly
Sprinkle the lamb with salt and pepper, and place on a shallow
roasting pan.

Bake at 325øF for 1 1/2 hours.

Combine the jelly and the remaining ingredients in a saucepan.  Cook
over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the jelly melts.
Refrigerate 1 cup of the jelly mixture.

Score the lamb at 1-inch intervals, and brush lightly with the
remaining jelly mixture.  Bake, basting every 15 minutes, for one
additional hour or until a meat thermometer registers 160øF.

Slice and serve with the reserved jelly mixture.

dry sherry for those that don't use alcohol.
