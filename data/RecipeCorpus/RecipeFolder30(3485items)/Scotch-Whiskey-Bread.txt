* You may substitute bourbon or rye if you prefer either to Scotch.
** Use half whole-wheat flour for a richer, firmer texture.

Preheat oven to 350 F. Marinate the raisins in the Scotch for 30 mins
or heat them gently for 5 mins. In a large mixing bowl, combine the
flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda and sugar; add the melted
butter and raisin-whiskey mixture. In a small mixing bowl, add the
beaten eggs to the milk. Pour this into the flour mixture and stir
well, adding a little more milk if the flour is very thick. Pour the
batter into 2 greased 1-qt souffle dishes and bake for 1 hr or until
a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. While it cools,
mix the ingredients for the glaze together; the consistency will be
runny. Dribble the loaves with the glaze. Yield: 2 loaves of 4-5
servings each
