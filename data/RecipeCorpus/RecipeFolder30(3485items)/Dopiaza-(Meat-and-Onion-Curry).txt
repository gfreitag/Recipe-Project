A north indian dish, Do(two)-piaza(onions) gets its name because
onions appear twice in the cooking process. the first batch is fried
and the second goes in raw later. Some recipes claim that the onion
quantity should be twice that of the meat, and if you love onion, you
can do this, but this recipe achieves a sweetish savoury taste with
less. You could use pork, beef, mutton, lamb or chicken etc.

If using chicken, skin it and cut into joints. If using meat, remove
fat, and cut into 1" cubes. Fry the finely chopped onions (the 1st
quantity) and garlic until golden in the ghee or oil. Fold in the
spices and stir fry about 5 minutes.

combine mixture with meat or poultry, the yoghurt and a cup of water,
and put it all into a casserole (dutch oven). Place in a preheated
oven at Gas mk 4 350F 180C and cook for 20 minutes (or longer if
using beef).

Add and mix in the raw thinly sliced onions (the second quantity), and
tomatoes, together with the coriander or parsley. Salt to taste.
Raise heat to 425F 220C Gas 7 and cook for a further 40 minutes or so.
