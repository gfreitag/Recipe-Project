Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 servings
2 c  Water
1/4 c  Oil or shortening
Margarine or butter, melted
(if desired)
6 c  Flour, all purpose (5 to 6)
3 tb Sugar
2 ts Salt
2 pk Yeast, active dry
Grease two 8x4 or 9x5-inch loaf pans.  In large bowl, combine 2 cups
flour, sugar, salt and yeast; blend well.  In small saucepan, heat
water and oil until very warm (120 to 130F.).  Add warm liquid to
flour mixture. Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at
medium speed. by hand, stir in an additional 2 1/2 to 3 cups flour
until dough pulls cleanly away from sides of bowl.

On floured surface, knead in 1/2 to 1 cup flour until dough is smooth
and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Place dough in a greased bowl; cover
loosely with plastic wrap and cloth towel.  Let rise in warm place
(80 to 85F.) until light and doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes.

Punch down dough several times to remove all air bubbles.  Divide
dough in half; shape into balls.  Shape into 2 loaves by rolling
dough into two 14x7-inch rectangles.  Starting with shorter side,
roll up each tightly; pinch edges and ends firmly to seal.  Place
seam side down in prepared pans.  Cover, let rise in warm place until
dough fills pans and tops of loaves are about 1 inch above pan edges,
about 30 to 35 minutes.

Heat oven to 375F.  Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until loaves sound
hollow when lightly tapped.  Remove from pans immediately; cool on
wire racks. Brush with melted margarine.

2 (18-slice) loaves.
