No Ingredients Found
one quart vinegar, 2 tbsp mustard seeds, 2 tbsp peppercorns, 2 pieces
ginger root, 2 blades of mace, some small pieces of horseradish, 2
cups brown sugar, 1 tsp cloves, a stick of cinnamon may be added.
Prepare vegetables. (None were given in the ingredient list, so I am
assuming that most everyone knew what went into pickle making back
then) Soak in brine overnight, drain and rinse.  Heat vinegar, sugar
and spices together. Let boil for 5-10 minutes, put vegetables in hot
sterilized jars and fill to overflowing with the vinegar.  Seal.
