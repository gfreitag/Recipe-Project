Seems that blueberries only got to Oz in the early 70's and are only
now becoming affordable.

This is one of Gabriel Gate's excellent. low-fat recipes.  It was
first published in his book Smart Food (Anne O'Donovan, 1989) for the
Anti-Cancer Council.

Blend 500 g blueberries to a puree with the juice of 2 oranges and 1
lemon.

Strain the mixture.  Stir in 1/4 cup sugar.  Beat together 1 cup
low-fat yoghurt and 2 tablespoons low-fat milk for about 5 minutes to
lighten them.

Add 1/4 cup of sugar and beat for a further minute.  Gently combine
the fruit preparation with the milk and yoghurt mixture.  Either
freeze in an ice cream maker or put the mixture in the freezer in a
bowl and as the mixture hardens, whisk it two or three times.  When
it is too firm to whisk any more, it is ready.

Makes 10 servings.
