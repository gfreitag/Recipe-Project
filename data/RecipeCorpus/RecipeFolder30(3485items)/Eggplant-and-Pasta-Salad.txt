*  If slender Japanese or small Italian eggplants are unavailable, use
larger eggplants, but after broiling, cut slices into bite-size
pieces.

1.   Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add pasta
and cook according to package directions.  Drain pasta and put into a
large bowl.

2.  While pasta cooks, make Pesto Vinaigrette:  With food processor or
blender running, drop garlic and walnuts through food chute (or hole
in blender cover) and process 7 seconds or until minced.  Add basil
and parsley and process until a thick puree results.  With machine
still running, add cheese, then Italian dressing, and process until
blended and smooth.

3.  Heat broiler.  Arrange half the eggplant on broiler-pan rack. Coat
eggplant with cooking spray.  Broil 4 inches from heat source, 6
minutes per side, until golden and tender.  Repeat with remaining
eggplant. Transfer to bowl with pasta.

4.  Arrange bell-pepper slices on broiler-pan rack. Broil 8 minutes,
turning once, until tender.

5.  Transfer peppers to a cutting board.  Cut in 1-inch pieces.  Add
to eggplant and pasta with cherry tomatoes.

6.  Add Pesto Vinaigrette and toss to mix and coat.
