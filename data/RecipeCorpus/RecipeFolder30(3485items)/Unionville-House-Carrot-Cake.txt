....................................................................
Here thanks to freelance recipe tester, former chef and all-round ace
cook, Heather Epp, is a recipe for carrot cake that she recently made
~- to rave reviews -- for her sister Lorraine's nuptial celebrations.
Epp got the recipe from Cheryl Ringler, co-owner and chef of the
Unionville House Restaurant in Unionville, and deems it the best
she's tried.

Epp made seven batches of this to produce enough cakefor 150 wedding
guests: one four-tiered cake (16-inch, 12-inch, 8-inch and cake, she
supported the layers with wooden dowels, available from specialty
baking stores. This cake will keep refrigerated, up to one week.
