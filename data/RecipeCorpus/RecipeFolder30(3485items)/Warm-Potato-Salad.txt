Title: Warm Potato Salad
Categories: Salads
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Tabasco (opt)
1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
8    Potatoes
2    Garlic cloves
1 c  Minced parsley
1/2 c  Oil
3 tb Vinegar
Quarter the potatoes and boil until tender.

Meanwhile, peel and mince garlic and place in a small jar. Wash and
dry the parsley, cut the stems off, then mince the parsley. Place in
the jar with the garlic. Add oil, vinegar, Tabasco if using, nutmeg,
salt and pepper. Screw the lid on the jar and shake vigorously to
dissolve the salt.

Drain potatoes and, when they are just cool enough to handle, slice
them thinly onto a serving platter or into a bowl. Drizzle with
dressing and serve hot, warm or cold.

Serves 6 and makes great leftovers. You may also add various fresh
herbs thyme, marjoram or dill, for example, if you have them in your
garden.

Serve the potatoes with roasted chicken and asparagus.
