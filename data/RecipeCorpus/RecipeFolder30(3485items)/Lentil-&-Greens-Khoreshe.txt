Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 lb Spinach leaves
-- coarsely chopped
1/4 lb Fresh parsley; chopped
2 oz Fresh cilantro; chopped
2 oz Tareh; chopped
-OR chopped garlic chives
1 c  Brown lentils; rinsed
1 lg Onion; finely chopped

A 'khoreshe' is a sauce-like main dish, to be served with rice.
'Tareh' resembles leeks, but much smaller, and with a garlic flavor.

In a heavy pan, brown the onion in oil over medium heat, stirring
frequently.  Add turmeric and fry for another minute or so.  Add
remaining ingredients, stir, and cover.   Decrease heat to low and
let simmer until lentils are tender, about 40 minutes.  Adjust
seasonings if necessary and serve khoreshe with the best quality of
rice you can obtain; basmati is what I recommend.  Wholemeal
flatbread is nice also, especially for dipping into the khoreshe.
