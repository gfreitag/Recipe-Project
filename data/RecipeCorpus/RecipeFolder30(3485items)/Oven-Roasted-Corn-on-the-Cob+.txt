MMMMM-------------------FRESH CORN ON THE COB------------------------
-any ammount
Remove exterior cornsilk.

Lay ears on middle rack in oven and turn the heat up very high.

When you smell the browned husks turn ears over and continue roasting
for same approximate time. (About 5 minutes per side.)

Remove ears from oven. Hold each ear with a towel and shuck off the
hot husk and silk which will be brittle and brown.

Roasting corn really brings out it's true flavor. The shuck gives the
ear it's own protection and becomes a handle when peeled back.

This info was gleaned from Craig Claiborne's "The New York Times
Cookbook."
