1 ea Put first four ingredients
-in a double boiler over
-gentle simmering
9 ea Egg yolks
1 c  Sweet marsala wine
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 c  Heavy whipping cream
water and whisk for 5 minutes, or until the sauce is frothy and thick
enough to leave a ribbon trail. Let cool slightly. 2. Whip the heavy
cream in a copper bowl or electric mixer to stiff peaks. 3. Working
over a bowl of ice, fold the whipped cream into the egg mixture and
gently spoon it into serving dishes. Garnish with fresh berries. Do
not overcook the sauce or it will curdle. Refrigerate it until ready
to serve. This frothy Italian egg desert has a curious history. It is
named for Marechal Balione, who defended Florence against the
Castracani in the 15th century. Reduced to eggs and brandy (the enemy
having captured the provision wagon) the Marshal's chef invented a
dessert, which he called zuppa baglioni-Baglioni's soup.
