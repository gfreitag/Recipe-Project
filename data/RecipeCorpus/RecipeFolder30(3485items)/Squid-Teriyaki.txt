Title: Squid Teriyaki
Categories: Japanese, Seafood
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Water
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Cornstarch
Juice of 2 lemons
3 lb Squid, cleaned and cut into
-rings
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1/2 c  Mirin, or 1/2 cup sherry
To make the terriyaki sauce, combine all the ingredients except the
cornstarch.  Reserve half of the sauce, marinate the squid in the
other half for 1 hour.

Prepare the fire.  Skewer squid pieces and tentacles.  Heat the
reserved terriyaki sauce in a saucepan.  When it begins to boil, add
the cornstarch dissolved in a little water.  As soon as the sauce
thickens, remove from heat.  As it cooks you will baste the squid
with this terriyaki sauce.

Grill the squid until it turns dark brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side,
depending on the heat, and then turn it over.  Baste one last time
and then remove skewers from the fire.  Serve over rice accompanied
with any remaining sauce.
