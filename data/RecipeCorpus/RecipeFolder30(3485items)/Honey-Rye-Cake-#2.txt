Title: Honey Rye Cake #2
Categories: Breads, Desserts
Yield: 1 loaf
1 ts Caraway seeds
1/2 ts Cloves
1/8 ts Cardamon, opt'l
1 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Grated lemon rind
1/3 c  Honey
3/4 c  Water

This version is my own, less sweet, with lemon and different spicing.
Prepare as per directions in version #1. Both recipes are deceptive:
very simple but also VERY tasty.
