2 tb Whipping cream, chilled
1 1/2 ts Liqueur, Grand Marnier
1 1/2 ea Pt strawberries, fresh,
-hulled & halved
Mint leaf, fresh
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Sugar
3 ea Egg yolk
1 1/2 ts Orange peel, grated
1/2 c  Champagne, dry
1/4 c  Whipping cream, chilled
**other sparkling wine may be substituted for the Champagne. My
notes: The egg yolk mixture didn't get thick enough (using large
eggs), so next time I plan to increase the amount to 4 yolks. Also, I
used Domaine St. Michelle for the "champagne." It's a really nice,
and inexpensive, sparkling dry wine from Washington state. Whisk
sugar, egg yolks and orange peel in a medium metal bowl until pale
yellow and thick, about 3 minutes. Set bowl over saucepan of
simmering water. Add Champagne to yolk mixture and whisk until
mixture is doubled in volume and holds shape on spoon, about 5
minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Set over another bowl filled
with ice. Cool completely, whisking occasionally. Using electric
mixer, beat cream with Grand Marnier in small bowl until almost
stiff. Fold cream and Grand Marnier into sabayon. (Can be prepared 8
hours ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.) Preheat
broiler. Divide strawberries among 4 shallow broilerproof bowls or
gratin dishes. Spoon sabayon over. Broil until light brown, about 2
minutes. Garnish with mint and serve.
