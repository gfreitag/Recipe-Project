Title: Acorn Squash and Wild Rice - PLhol
Categories: Vegetables, Rice
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Minced fresh sage
1/4 c  Fresh orange juice
2 ts Fresh lemon juice
1/8 ts Freshly grated pepper
2 c  Cooked wild rice
2    Acorn squash, ~1-1/2 lb ea
1/2 lb Small Brussels sprouts
2 ts Olive oil
1 c  Diced onion
1 ts Fennel seeds
1 ts Dried marjoram
1.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).

2.  Cut each squash in half and remove the seeds and pulp.  In a large
baking dish, place the squash, cut side down, with about 1 inch of
water. Bake until tender, about 45 minutes.

3.  Pour about 2 inches of water into a large stockpot.  Place a
collapsible steamer in the pot, cover, and bring to a boil.  Place the
Brussels sprouts in the steamer, cover, and steam for 5 to 7 minutes,
or until tender.  Set aside.

4.  Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the oil over low heat.  Add
the onion and saute for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.  Stir in the
fennel, marjoram, sage, orange juice, lemon juice, and pepper, and
simmer for 3 minutes.  Stir in the cooked wild rice and the Brussels
sprouts and heat through.

5.  Spoon the wild rice and Brussels sprout mixture into the squash
cavities.  Serve immediately.

I often microwave the acorn squash by placing in a shallow glass pan
with about 1/2-inch of water, covering with saran wrap and nuking for
about 10 minutes or until tender.
