Title: Yetakelt W'et (Spicy Mixed Vegetable Stew)
Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables, African, Homemade
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Potatoes, cubed
1 c  Tomatoes, chopped
1/4 c  Tomato paste
2 c  Vegetable stock
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley(OPT)
1 c  Onions, finely chopped
2    Garlic cloves, pressed
1 tb Berbere (dry)
1 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
1/4 c  Niter Kebbeh
1 c  Green beans, cut in thirds
1 c  Carrots, chopped
Saute the onions, garlic, berbere, and paprika in the niter kebbeh
for 2 minutes.  Add the beans, carrots, and potatoes and continue to
saute for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.
Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, and vegetable stock.  Bring
to a boil and then simmer for 15 minutes, or until all of the
vegetables are tender. [personal comment: we simmered more like 40
minutes, until it eventually thickened.]

Add salt and pepper to taste.  Mix in the parsley (optional).

Serve with injera and yogurt or cottage cheese.
