To cook eggs so that they will be firm all the way through and yet not
tough or indigestible, put them in a saucepan of boiling water, cover
closely and place on part of the stove where the water will remain
very hot, but not boil, and let stand for twenty minutes. To cook
eggs so they will be soft, follow the above directions, but let the
eggs remain only 10 minutes. It's that easy. Many of the recipes in
this collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have
typed them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
