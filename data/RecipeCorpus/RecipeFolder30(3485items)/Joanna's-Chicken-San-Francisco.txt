One of the recipes here inspired me to create this dish tonight. I
served it with broccoli (fresh, just the flowerets, microwave covered
for 5 minutes with a dash of seasoned salt and a pat of butter) and
sourdough bread.  Dessert was peach kuchen and ice cream. My number 1
consumer and critic said it was great!
