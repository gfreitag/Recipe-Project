Title: Tastycake Peanut Butter Kandy Kakes
Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 30 cakes
1 c  Peanut butter
1/2 c  Powdered sugar
11 1/2 oz Milk chocolate chips
4    Egg whites
16 oz Pound cake mix
2/3 c  Water
Preheat the oven to 325.  Beat the egg whites until fluffy. Blend the
egg whites with the cake mix and water. Pour TBSP size dollops of
batter into each cup of a greased muffin tin. Bake for 10 minutes.
Make 5 batches. Clean muffin tin for later use.  Do not grease.
Combine peanut butter and sugar.  While the pound cake rounds cool,
melt the chocolate chips in microwave.  When chocolate is soft, line
the bottom half of each muffin cup with shortening; then use a spoon
to spread a thin layer of chocolate in each cup. With your fingers
spread a thin layer of peanut butter over the chocolate.  Place a
cake round on the peanut butter layer. Spread a layer of chocolate
over the top of each cake, spreading to the sides to cover the entire
surface.  Cool in the refrigerator for 10 minutes and turn out of the
tin.  Source:  Top Secret Recipes Submitted By MEG ANTCZAK   On
