Carefully peel the oranges and separate the sections. Strew on mixed
sugar, nutmeg, mace, and cinnamon.
Prepare a thick batter by uniting the flour, baking powder, salt, and
brown sugar. Blend 2 tablespoons of oil, the egg (well beaten) and the
milk. Thoroughly stir this liquid into the dry mixture. If the batter
is thin, add a scant amount more of flour. If it is too thick to
evenly coat the orange sections, then dilute with more milk. Chill
batter for 1-1/2 hours.
Heat the remaining oil in a heavy skillet until hot, not smoking.
Dip orange sections in batter to coat thoroughly. Drop into hot oil
and fry until nicely browned. Serve warm, with mustard and brown
sugar in separate spice dishes.
