Title: Barbecued Salmon
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 servings

The Indians use to leave the cleaned salmon in the Salt Chuck
overnight. You can soak mesquite or other barbecuing chips in hot
water for one hour. Heat barbecue and add soaked chips to coals and
heat until chips begin to smoke.  Thread salmon fillet lengthwise on
to skewer and place skin side down on greased grill.  Cover and cook
