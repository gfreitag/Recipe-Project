Title: Cumberland Sausage / from Grigson's Observer Cookbook
Categories: Homemade, Sausage
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM--------------------FROM :  DIANE DUANE-------------------------
1 x  Salt, pepper, nutmeg, mace
1 lb Shoulder of pork, minced
1/2 x  Slice smoked bacon,
6 oz Pork back fat, minced
1 oz Stale breadcrumbs
Minced
The pork should be boned and skinned.  Mix the shoulder and the fat.
Add 8 tablespoons hot water to the crumbs.  Mix everything together
(use your hands), seasoning well with pepper, and adding a generous
pinch of both the spices.  Fry a spoonful of the sausage to test the
seasoning.  Fill the sausage casings as usual.  Prick in a few places
and allow to sit overnight before cooking.  ...These are very good
baked in a buttered baking dish at 350F until browned.  Turn after 20
minutes, and raise the heat if the sausages are cooking too slowly.
