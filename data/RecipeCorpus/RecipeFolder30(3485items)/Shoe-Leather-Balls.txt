Title: Shoe Leather Balls
Categories: Candies, Homemade
Yield: 1 servings
Superfine Granulated Sugar
3/4 lb Dried Apricots
1/4 lb Dried Peaches
Use only VERY, VERY dry dried fruit. Put the dried fruits through a
food grinder, coating a board with fine sugar, placing the fruit on
top, rolling the fruit 1/8 inch thick with a rolling pin, and cutting
it into 1-inch strips. To accomplish this, it is absolutely essential
that the dried fruit be very, very dry. If you end up with fruit that
is too moist and too sugary to roll, simply form the fruit into small
balls with your fingers and top each ball with a nut, cherry, or a
sprinkle of coconut. Either way, it produces tasty candy. Store your
shoe leather or shoe leather balls in the refrigerator. Yield: 1
pound.
