Title: Creamy Cannelloni with Chicken and Almonds
Categories: Poultry, Pasta
Yield: 6 servings
3/4 c  Grated Swiss cheese
FILLING:
1 1/2 c  Diced cooked chicken
1 pk Frozen spinach, thawed and
-drained
3/4 c  Ricotta cheese
1/3 c  Toasted slivered almonds
1/4 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
-cheese
1    Egg
1/4 ts Grated nutmeg
22    Precooked dried cannelloni
-shells (see note)
2    Chopped tomatoes
2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
-cheese
SAUCE:
3 tb Butter
1    Chopped onion
3 tb Flour
1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
1 c  Light cream
Salt and pepper to taste
Sauce: Melt butter in a saucepan. Saute onion until tender. Stir in
flour and cook for 1 minute. Add stock, cream, salt and pepper. Cook
until boiling and thickened, 8-10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir
in the Swiss cheese. Cover with waxed paper and set aside.

Filling: Combine chicken, spinach, Ricotta, almonds, Parmesan, egg and
nutmeg. Blend all ingredients together.

Assembly: Place filling in the pre-cooked shells. Pour a thin layer of
sauce over the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange the stuffed
cannelloni in a single layer over the sauce. Sprinkle with the
chopped tomatoes, and pour the sauce over the cannelloni. Sprinkle
with Parmesan cheese. Cover with aluminium foil. Bake at 350 degrees
F for 60-70 minutes or until pasta is soft and the top bubbles.

Note: The kind of pasta used in this dish is dried, but is usually
called "oven ready". I believe it is coated in egg whites to enable
it to cook right in the oven when well-covered in sauce. If you make
the dish ahead and refrigerate, the cooking time will be cut down
because the pasta will soften in the refrigeration.
