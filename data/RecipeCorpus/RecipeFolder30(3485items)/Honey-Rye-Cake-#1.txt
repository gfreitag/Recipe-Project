This tea bread will keep for weeks and should be aged at least three
days before slicing. It toasts and broils well and is sweet enough to
be a dessert. Recipe #1 is from the Joy of Cooking and recipe #2 is
my less sweet, lemony version.

Preheat oven to 350. In a double boiler heat until near boiling the
water, honey and sugar. Remove from heat and thoroughly beat into the
mixture the flour, soda, baking powder and spices. Add and mix the
nuts, rind and citron. With a rubber spatula press the dough into a
loaf pan and bake one hour.  Remove from oven, invert pan and tap out
onto a cake rake to cool. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   05-02-95
