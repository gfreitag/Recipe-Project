Title: Crispy Potato Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Potato
Yield: 4 servings
And split in halve
1 1/2 ts Olive oil or cooking oil
Ground black pepper
Snipped fresh parsley,
-cilantro, rosemary,
Or chives
1 lg Potato (8 ounces), peeled
3 tb Dijon-style mustard (or
-more)
1 lg Clove garlic, minced
2    Whole chicken breasts (1
-pound), skinned
In a food processor fitted with a medium shredding disk, coarsely
shred the potato.  (OR, shred with a grater.) Transfer the shredded
potato to a bowl of ice water; let stand for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine the mustard and garlic; mix well.
Rinse the chicken and thoroughly pat dry.  Brush or spread the
mustard mixture on the meaty side of the chicken breast halves.
Place the chicken, bone side down, in a foil lined 15 x 10 x 1-inch
baking pan.

Drain the potato.  Thoroughly pat dry with paper towels.  (For crisp,
golden potato "skin", make sure you pat the potato shreds as dry as
possible.) Place the potatoes in a medium mixing bowl.  Add the olive
oil; toss to mix well.  Top each piece of chicken with about 1/3 cup
of the potato mixture in an even layer, forming a "skin".  Sprinkle
lightly with pepper.

Bake in a 425 F oven for 35 to 40 minutes or until the chicken is no
longer pink and the potato shreds are golden.  (If potatoes are not
browning, transfer pan to broiler.  Broil for about 5 minutes or
until golden, watching closely.) Sprinkle with the desired herbs.
Serve immediately

Makes 4 servings.
