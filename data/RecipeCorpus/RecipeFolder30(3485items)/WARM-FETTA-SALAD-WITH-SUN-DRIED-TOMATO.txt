In advance, cut the cheese to fit the croutons. Place on a baking tray
ready to grill. Wash the rocket; dry well. Julienne the sun-dried
tomatoes. Mix the dressing ingredients; set aside.

To serve: Grill the cheese a few minutes, not too close to the
griller, until it heats through, and just begins to "slacken" on the
edges (not enough to skin or colour). Transfer to the centre of each
plate. Scatter a little rocket around the cheese, and a smattering of
sun-dried tomato. Drizzle the salad with dressing; garnish with
chopped basil. Serves 6 as an entree.

Variation: Change rocket for dwarf frise; diced Granny Smith apple
for the sun-dried tomato. Stir 2 tblspns cider vinegar and 1 tspn
honey into 6 tblspns sheep's yoghurt; salt and pepper. Drizzle this
around the plate rather than over the salad. Scatter chopped walnuts.
Serves 6 as an entree or cheese course.
