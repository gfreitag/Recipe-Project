To an English pint of red port (Burgundy or claret is better) add
fifteen anchovies, chopped and prepared by steeping in vinegar in a
close-covered vessel for a week;  add to this a stick of
horse-radish, scrapped, two onions, and a handful of parsley chopped,
a dessertspoonful of lemon thyme stripped of the stalks, two
bay-leaves, nutmeg, and six blades of mace roughly pounded, nine
cloves, and a small dessertspoonful of black pepper bruised.  Pour
over these ingredients a large half-pint of port-wine vinegar, and
simmer slowly in a silver or new block-tin saucepan, or earthen
pipkin, till the bones of the anchovies are dissolved. Add a few
grains of cochineal if the colour is not good. Strain the liquor
through a hair sieve and, when cold, bottle it for use, securing the
vials well with corks and leather. When to be used shake the vials
before pouring out the sauce; two tablespoonfuls will impart a high
flavor to four ounces of beat butter, in which it must be simmered
for a minute before it is served. From: The Scots Kitchen with Old
