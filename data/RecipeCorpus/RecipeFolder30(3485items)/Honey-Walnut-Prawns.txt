Here's a goody.  I normally shy away from Western influenced Chinese
recipes and would never have fixed this one on my own.  It calls for
such non-Chinese things as milk and mayonnaise.  My room mate fixed
it the other night though, and it was excellent.  He was trying to
duplicate a dish that he and his date had at a Chinese place a while
back and apparently, this is almost it.  Laurie suggested it would be
closer to the restaurant dish by just dusting the shrimp with
cornstarch rather than making a batter. I imagine that it would be
good either way. It certainly is good this way!

Rinse walnuts, then boil in 5 cups water, continually changing water
until clear.  When clear, boil with sugar until sugar dissolves. Heat
2 cups oil until almost smoking, then deep-fry walnuts until they're
shiny and brown, no longer golden.  Remove walnuts to cookie sheet,
let cool. Mix cornstarch and egg whites together to form a thick,
sticky texture and mix well with prawns.  Set aside.  Mix honey,
mayonnaise, lemon juice and condensed milk in a medium bowl until
smooth.

Heat oil until boiling, then deep fry prawns until golden brown.

Drain, then fold in honey-mayonnaise mixture. mix well, sprinkle with
walnuts, and arrange on platter.

Serves 4 to 6.
