Crumble mixture:  Place pieces of broken chocolate and brown sugar in
food processor or blender. Process about 15 to 20 seconds or until as
fine as coarse ground coffee. Add orange rind, cinnamon, coffee,
butter and pecans. Process a short time until nuts are finely
chopped. Set aside.

Coffee Cake:  Place flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in food
proces- sor; process for a few seconds to combine or prepare by hand
using a pastry blender. Sprinkle small butter cubes over dry
ingredients. Process only 5-6 seconds to distribute butter into very
small pieces, or use pastry blender. Transfer to a bowl. Spread
mixture to form a well in the center. Beat whole egg lightly with
half & half. Pour, all at once, into dry ingredients. Using a folding
motion, stir to combine ingredi- ents, mixing only until liquid is
all absorbed. (Do not overmix. This should take only 15-20 hand
strokes.) Sprinkle the crumble mixture over dough in bowl. With a
table knife, draw across in 2 directions to marble crumble with
dough. (Do not combine thoroughly.)  Heavily grease cups of muffin
pans, disposable foil pans, glass custard cups or cupcake liners.
When portioning dough, mixture will be rough but will come together
after baking.

To make large size muffins, fill cups level to top, yielding 9
muffins. For medium muffins, fill cups 2/3 full, yielding 12 muffins.
Prepare egg wash by mixing water with egg yolk. Brush muffins with
egg wash. Bake at 400 F for 15-17 minutes, depending upon the size of
the muffins. Muffins should be golden brown and baked in the center.
Cool in pans about 5 minutes to firm muffins before removing. Serve
warm.
