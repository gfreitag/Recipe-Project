Title: Par-cooked Balti Lamb
Categories: Main dish, Indian, Balti, Meats
Yield: 16 servings
2 1/2 c  Stock or water
4 tb Balti masala paste
6 lb Lamb steak; cut in 1 1/4 in
-cubes and weighed nett.
Using a large lidded casserole dish, bring the stock or water to the
boil. Add the meat and the paste and bring to a simmer, stirring as
needed. Put the lidded dish into the oven, pre-heated to
375F/190C/Gas 5.
Cook for 20 mins. Inspect and stir, adding a little water if
needed. cook for 20 more minutes. Test for tenderness; it should
still have a bite, and not be quite ready. If not yet at this stage,
continue cooking a while longer.
When it is at this stage, remove from the casserole, strain and
reserve the liquid. Cool down the meat, divide into containers and
freeze. Alternatively, some or all of the par-cooked meat can be used
to carry on with the Balti meat recipes. The stock should also be
frozen in suitable portions and used to make a tasty curry sauce, or
in recipes.

NB Other meats can be cooked in exactly the same way, adjusting the
cooking time as required. Pieces of meat on the bone will require
more time too. Try Beef, Venison, Mutton, Pork and even Goat!
