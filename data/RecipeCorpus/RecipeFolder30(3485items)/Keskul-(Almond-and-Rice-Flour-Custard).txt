Title: Keskul (Almond and Rice-Flour Custard)
Categories: Middle east, Turkish, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Almond extract
1/4 c  Rice flour
1 tb Pomegranate seeds, fresh
1 tb Almonds; finely chopped
1 tb Pistachio nuts; unsalted and
;finely chopped
2 c  Light cream
2 c  Milk
1 c  Almonds, blanched; pulverize
;with a blender, nut grinder
;or mortar/pestle
3/4 c  Sugar
In a 2 to 3 quart saucepan, combine the cream, 1 « cups of the
milk, the ground almonds, sugar and almond extract.  Bring to a boil,
remove the pan from the heat, cover, and let the almonds steep for 20
minutes. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve set over a bowl,
pressing down hard on the almonds with the back of a spoon to extract
their moisture before discarding them.
Return the almond flavored liquid to the saucepan.  Dissolve the
rice flour in the remaining « cup of milk, stir it into the liquid
and set the pan over low heat.  Stirring frequently, simmer for about
15 minutes, or until the custard thickens enough to coat the spoon
lightly. Strain through a fine sieve and spoon the custard at once
into 6 individual dessert bowls. Chill in the refrigerator for about
1 hour. Before serving, garnish with pomegranate seeds ringed with
circles of chopped almonds and pistachio nuts.
