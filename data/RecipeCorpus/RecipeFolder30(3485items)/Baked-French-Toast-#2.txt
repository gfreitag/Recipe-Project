Title: Baked French Toast #2
Categories: Breakfast, Low cal/fat
Yield: 8 pieces
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
8 sl Bread
12 oz Evaporated skim milk
4    Eggs
Lightly coat 9"x13"x2" pan with non-stick vegetable spray.  Arrange
bread slices in bottom of pan.  Combine all remaining ingredients and
mix well, using whisk or egg beater.  Pour mixture evenly over bread.
Cover tightly and refrigerate several hours or overnight.

To bake, preheat oven to 350.  Remove bread from refrigerator and
spray lightly with non-stick vegetable spray.  Bake 30-35 minutes,
until lightly browned.  Serve with hot maple syrup, powdered sugar,
and cinnamon.

Sylvia's notes: this worked fine, came out reasonably crisp on the
outside and reasonably soggy on the inside.  Definitely a fine
lower-fat alternative to the traditional fried french toast.
