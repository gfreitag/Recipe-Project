MEZONOT ROLLS

....................................................................
Mezonot rolls are convenient on the buffet tables or in picnic
baskets and lunch boxes. Many authorities maintain  that they do not
require the washing of the hands beforehand or the long blessing for
bread afterwards. The reason is that they are made with fruit juice,
in addition to water -- unlike bread which contains only water.
....................................................................

In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon of sugar in warm
water. Cover and let stand for 10 minutes until foamy. Add 4 cups of
flour and remaining ingredients. Beat until smooth, by hand or with
an electric mixer. Beat in remaining flour. Knead until smooth and
shiny -- about 10 minutes. Brush with oil and place in a large
plastic bag (to allow for rising) or in a large greased bowl, and
cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise in a warm spot until double in
bulk -- about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down and let rest for 10 minutes.
Form into small round buns or other shapes. Place 3 inches apart on a
large greased baking sheet. Brush with glaze and sprinkle with sesame
seeds. Put in warm place, cover and let rise until double -- about 1
hour. Bake in a preheated 400 F oven for 15 minute or until golden
brown.

Yields about 40 small rolls.
