1. Blench broccoli by dropping it into boiling water for 2 or 3
minutes, then quickly "refresh" it by running it under cold water.

2. Dress with sesame oil and soy sauce (or vinegar) to taste, then
sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds. Add the dressing just before
serving (at room temperature) or it will discolor the broccoli.
