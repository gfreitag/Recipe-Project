Title: Sweet and Hot Bulgogi
Categories: Korean, Meats, Asian
Yield: 12 servings
2 ts Black pepper
1 tb Hot chili sesame oil
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1 tb Brown sugar
1 cl Garlic (diced fine)
1 lg Carrot (shredded)
2 lb Flank meat sliced in 1/4
Inch strips(remove all fat)
1 sm Can crushed pineapple
1 bn Green onions (chopped fine)
1 sm Yellow onion (chopped
Coarse)
Mix all ingredients in a large mixing bowl (including juice from
pineapple). Let it marinate overnight or minimum 8 hours. Saute over
med high heat in large skillet or wok until meat is lightly browned.
Ensure the juice is added during cooking.This batch should take two
trips to the stove to cook. I like it served over the wide crispy La
Choy noodles.(my friend prefers the noodles) I would use steamed
rice... Submitted By FRANK SKELLY   On   05-09-95
