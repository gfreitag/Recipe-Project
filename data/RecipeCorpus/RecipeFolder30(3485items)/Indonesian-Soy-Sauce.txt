Title: Indonesian Soy Sauce
Categories: Indonesian, '
Yield: 1 batch
6    Bay Leaves
2 ts Laos**
1/2    Bag Demerara Sugar
2    Bottles Regular Soy Sauce*
3    Bottles Water
4 md Onions - chopped
*I use 17 oz. bottles of China Lily (a Canadian Brand) **Laos is also
called Gallingal and can be found at Asian food/spice stores.

Here's the recipe for Indonesian Soy Sauce, which I THINK is called
Kecap Manis.  And even if it's not you might find some use for it...
;-}

Put all the ingredients in a large pot and cook on medium till onions
are limp.  Add sugar and bring to a boil to dissolve sugar.  Strain
and pour into bottles.  I keep it in the fridge but I don't know if
you have to.

It's a very sweet Soy Sauce that may take a little getting used to
but you will probably find that you can use it for things and not
worry about a "salty" taste.
