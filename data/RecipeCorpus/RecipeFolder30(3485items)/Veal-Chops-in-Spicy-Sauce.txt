Rose Hansen & Associates (Sausalito, Ca.) donated this recipe which is
delicious served with saffron biryani, pilaf or couscous.

Dredge chops in flour and brown on both sides in hot oil in a Dutch
oven on medium heat.  Remove chops from pot and keep warm.  Saute
onion, garlic and spices in pot over low heat, stirring when needed,
until onion is limp. Add broth and chops.  Simmer covered until meat
is tender, about 50 minutes. Remove chops, keep warm.  Drain off
excess fat from pot, whisk in tomato paste and reduce liquid over
high heat to 1 1/2 cups. Meanwhile, mix last 5 ingredients together.
Pour hot sauce over meat, and serve with yogurt mixture around each
chop.
