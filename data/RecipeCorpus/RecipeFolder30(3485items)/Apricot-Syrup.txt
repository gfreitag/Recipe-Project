Title: Apricot Syrup
Categories: Breakfast, Syrups
Yield: 2 servings
4    Whole Cloves
5 c  Cold Water
6 oz Dried Apricots
3/4 c  Sugar
1 sl Lemon
1. In a heavy saucepan, combine the apricots with the sugar, lemon,
cloves, and the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until
the apricots are very soft, 1 to 1 1/4 hrs.

2. Discard the lemon slice and cloves and puree the mixture in a
blender or food processor.

Makes about 2 cups.

Note: If the syrup has boiled rapidly and become too thick for your
taste, add about 1/3 cup of cold water and bring the syrup again to a
boil. This is a thick syrup, however, so avoid adding too much water.
This is especially fine on waffles or pancakes and will keep in the
refrigerator for weeks.
