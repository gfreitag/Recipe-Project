Title: Sweet and Sour Rice Noodles with Peanuts
Categories: Main dish, Side dish, Pasta, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
4    Garlic cloves (or more)
-- minced
26 oz Rice noodles
3/4 c  Crushed roasted peanuts
8    Scallions; sliced
2    Serrano chilies; stemmed
-- thinly sliced into rounds
Fresh cilantro leaves
Ground red pepper
3 tb Oil
1/2 c  Lemon or lime juice
1/4 c  White vinegar
-- (may be omitted)
1 tb Tamarind paste
2 tb Soy sauce or tamari
2/3 c  Sugar or brown sugar
-OR- other sweetener
-- (palm sugar is nice)
Combine oil, lemon or lime juice, vinegar, tamarind paste, sugar, soy
sauce and garlic in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then turn
down heat to low and cook until mixture is thickened and syrupy,
about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook noodles in boiling water until tender.  Drain
completely, but do not rinse.  Return hot noodles to empty pot and
pour sauce over. Stir gently to coat evenly.  Cover pot and allow to
stand until sauce is absorbed, at least 15 minutes.  To serve, gently
separate noodles with two forks and turn out onto a large platter or
casserole dish. Garnish with crushed peanuts, chopped green onions,
thin slices of green chili peppers, finely sliced cilantro leaves,
and a sprinkling of ground red pepper. May be served warm or chilled.
