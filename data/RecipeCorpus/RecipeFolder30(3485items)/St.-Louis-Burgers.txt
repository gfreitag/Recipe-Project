1 c  Shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 c  Chopped dill pickles

Make pocket in rolls by cutting off most of the top crust, leaving
about a 1/2-inch border; save top crusts.  Hollow out centers of
rolls. Brown beef in skillet; drain fat.  Stir in barbecue sauce,
salt, pepper, cheese and pickles.  Simmer 5 to 10 minutes. Fill rolls
with meat mixture. Replace tops.  Wrap each roll in foil, sealing
ends well. Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven 15 to 20 minutes,
until hot throughout. Might be enough for 8 sandwiches.

Note:  Sandwiches can be prepared ahead and refrigerated before
baking. Bake just before serving. Ruth Busiek Barnhart, MO.
