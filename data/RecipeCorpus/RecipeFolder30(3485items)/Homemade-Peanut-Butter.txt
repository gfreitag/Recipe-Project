Title: Homemade Peanut Butter
Categories: Nuts/grains, Homemade
Yield: 2 servings
2 pn Salt (or more)
2 pn Sugar (or more)
2 c  Peanuts (NOT dry roasted)
2 tb Oil (or more)
Place all ingredients into food processor.  Blend on high for about 5
minutes. Store in fridge.  If the peanuts are fresh, the oil may rise
to the top after sitting for a while so you may have to stir it
before using. Use a good quality oil, peanut oil if you can get it.
CHUNKY: When you have about a minute left, add a few more peanuts to
the already blended mixture. Process a while longer, leaving some
chunks of peanuts. Origin: Sharon Stevens Shared by: Sharon Stevens
