From Will Greenwood, not-quite White House chef.

For the rub: Combine the chili, garlic and onion powders, the sugar,
salt, allspice, cumin, white pepper and paprika in a food processor
until thoroughly mixed. Sprinkle all but 1 1/2 tablespoons of the rub
on all sides of the salmon. Let fillets marinate for 6 hours.

To cook the salmon: Prepare a very hot grill. If you are using wood
chips on the hot coals, first soak these in water so they will smoke
more. Add soaked chips 5 minutes before starting the salmon.

Rub the fillets with a thin film of olive oil. Grill them
approximately 8-10 minutes, depending on thickness.

For the field greens and vinaigrette: Clean and refresh the greens in
cold water. Spin dry. Mix the vegetable juice, vinegar and tomato
together with the reserved barbecue rub and olive oil. Toss with the
greens.

To serve: Divide greens among plates. Top each plate with a salmon
fillet. Spoon the remaining vinaigrette in the bowl over the salmon.
Serve hot.
