Put the pork and pork fat into a large mixing bowl and add the sage,
paprika and salt.

If preground black pepper is used add it. Otherwise grind the pepper
using a peppermill.

If red pepper flakes being used add them. Otherwise grind the pods.

Mix well with hands, cover and let stand in refrigerator overnight

Put the mixture through a meat grinder fitted with the largest blade..
Remove all the meat left in the grinder and clean grinder blade.

Return the blade to the grinder and fit it along with the special
sausage attachment, to the mouth of the grinder. Slide 1 prepared
sausage casing onto the attachment and tie the end. Grind the meat,
holding the casing to permit free entry of the filling into the
casing. When about 16 inches of casing have been filled, pinch the
casing at the end of the sausage attachment. Pull it out to leave
about 4 inches of empty casing at that end. Tie that end. Tie both
ends of the sausage together. Set aside. Continue making sausages in
this manner until all the stuffing has been used.

Hang the sausages in a smoker and smoke according to manufacturer's
instructions.
