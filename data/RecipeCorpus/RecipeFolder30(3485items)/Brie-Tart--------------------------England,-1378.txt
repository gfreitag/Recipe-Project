1/2 ts Ginger
1 ts Sugar
3 ea Eggs plus 2 extra yolks
3/4 lb Flaky pastry

Line a 10" quiche dish with the pastry and bake at 400f for 10
minutes. Put the cream, saffron, and cheese in a covered bowl in the
oven at 200f for 20 to 30 minutes, until the cheese has melted
somewhat and the saffron has dissolved and coloured the cream.
Transfer the mixture to a blender and blend just long enough to
amalgamate properly. Add the ginger, sugar, and seasoning of salt and
pepper, tasting carefully after each addition.
Beat the eggs with a fork or rotary beater, in a separate bowl,
and pour the contents of the blender into them, still whipping. Pour
the resulting mixture into the quiche shell and bake at 350f for 30
minutes, or until set and puffy.
Serve with a green salad flavoured with herbs, using lemon juice
instead of vinegar in the dressing.

From the original: Take a crust inch deep in a trap; take yolks of
eggs raw and cheese ruayn and meddle it and the yolks together and do
thereto powder, ginger, sugar, safron, and salt, do it in a trap,
bake it well and serve it forth.
