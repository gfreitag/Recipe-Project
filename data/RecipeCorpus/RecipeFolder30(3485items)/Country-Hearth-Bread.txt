dough smooth. Let rest 15 minutes. Turn dough out onto lightly
floured board and knead for 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wash
bowl, grease it; add dough to bowl, turn over to grease top, cover,
and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Cover a baking sheet with
parchment or lightly grease it. Punch dough down and shape into a
ball. Place ball on prepared sheet and roll or pat into a circle
about 8" in diameter. Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about
45 minutes. Brush top of loaf with milk and sprinkle generously with
oats. Preheat oven to 375'F. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until loaf
sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from oven and cool on wire rack.
