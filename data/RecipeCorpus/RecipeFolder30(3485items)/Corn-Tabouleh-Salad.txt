Bulgur wheat is readily available in most supermarkets and specialty
food stores. If you prefer another grain, you can easily substitute
cooked rice, barley or couscous. When mixing the salad, use a fork to
keep grains from sticking together.

1. Combine the bulgur, garlic, water and olive oil in a large bowl.
Mix together, then set aside for 30 minutes.

2. In another bowl, mix the diced Granny Smith apple and golden
raisins with lemon juice to prevent the apple from discoloring.

3. After 30 minutes, fluff the bulgur well with a fork. Add all the
remaining ingredients, using a fork to combine and fluff the salad.

NOTE: If you like your corn very sweet (and who doesn't?), add 1
tablespoon of sugar to the boiling water before you cook the corn.
