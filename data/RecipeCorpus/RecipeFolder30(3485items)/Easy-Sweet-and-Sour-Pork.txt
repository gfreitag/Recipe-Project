PART 1:

1. Cut pork into 1/2x1/2x1" rectangles. Marinate in mixture of salt,
soya sauce and sherry for at least half an hour. While meat is
marinating, prepare Part 2.

2. Add 2 tablespoons oil to wok and heat up to smoking point. Take a
slotted spoon and use it to lift pork pieces from marinate, place in
wok and brown meat on all sides. Lower heat slightly to medium high
and continue to cook meat for a full 15 minutes, using turner to stir
pieces occasionally.

3. At end of cooking time, place meat in serving dish. Pour sauce
from Part 2 over it.

PART 2:

1. Place white sugar and vinegar in a small 1 quart pot. Boil together
until sugar is dissolved. Stir up corn starch in 1/4 cup water. Add to
vinegar-sugar boil. Stir solution, lower heat to medium low, add
pineapple juice and tomato soup. Boil solution 15-20 minutes, until
it turns from milky red to a clear reddish yellow.

2. Add suggested embellishments. You can use all of them or some of
them. Cook 2 minutes. Serve over Part 1.

NOTE: Pork spare ribs cut into 1 1/2" lengths may be used in place of
pork butt. However, spare ribs have more fat than fresh ham or pork
butt, so use 1 tablespoon less oil in stir-frying ribs or else
discard fat which accumulates in wok when ribs are finished cooking.
Also Part 2 (sans embellishments) can be made in a larger quantity
and store in a covered plastic container in refrigerator for 2-3
weeks.
