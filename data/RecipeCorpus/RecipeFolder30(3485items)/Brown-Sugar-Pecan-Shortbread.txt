Title: Brown Sugar-Pecan Shortbread
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 6 dozen
1 c  Unsalted butter, room temp
1/2 c  Packed dark brown sugar
2 c  Unbleached flour
1 c  Pecan pieces
1 pn Salt
Grind the flour, pecans and salt in a food processor fitted with a
steel blade to a fine powder.  Set aside.  Using an electric mixer or
a wooden spoon, cream the butter and sugar.  When the mixture is very
smooth and creamy, mix in the pecan mixture.  Gather the dough into a
ball, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours or
overnight. Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Line cookie sheets with
parchment paper. Roll out the dough 1/4" thick on a lightly floured
surface. Cut into shapes with 1" cookie cutters.  Gather up the
scraps, reroll and cut into as many cookies as possible.  Place on
the prepared cookie sheets and bake until lightly colored, 20 to 25
minutes. From The Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook by Julee Russo &
