Title: Souffles Potatoes
Categories: Potato, Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
Oil For Deep Frying
12 md Potatoes
Peel potatoes, cut lengthwise into slices 1/8" thick.  Wash and dry on
cloth.  A few at a time, plunge into deep hot - but not too hot - fat
(365øF).  Gradually heat fat and cook until potatoes begin to rise to
surface, about 7 minutes.  Drain in basket.  Plunge again in a second
pan of oil, heated to 375øF.  Potatoes should be puffed immediately.
Drain on absorbent paper.  At this stage, potatoes can wait
indefinitely.  At time of serving, reheat potatoes in hot oil, drain
on absorbent paper and add salt.  From: Syd's Cookbook.
