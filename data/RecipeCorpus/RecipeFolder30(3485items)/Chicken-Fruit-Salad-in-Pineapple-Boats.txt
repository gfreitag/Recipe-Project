POPPY SEED DRESSING*
*MMMMM

Combine sugar, mustard, salt and vinegar. Stir in onion juice. Slowly
add oil, beating constantly until thick. Add poppy seeds and beat a
few minutes. Store in refrigerator but avoid putting in very cold
spot as dressing may separate. If dressing separates, pour off clear
part. Beat clear portion, then slowly beat in poppy-seed mixture.

To make salad, lay pineapples on sides and cut horizontal slice in
each to make boat, leaving top leaves intact. Remove meat of
pineapples and cut into chunks. In large bowl, combine drained
pineapple chunks, chicken, papaya, celery, oranges, watermelon,
bananas and kiwi. Toss at once with poppy-seed dressing to taste.
Chill until ready to serve. Before serving, toss with 1/2 cup chopped
nuts. Serve in pineapple shells and sprinkle with more nuts, if
desired.
