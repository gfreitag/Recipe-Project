Title: Fisherman's Bread (Pane Del Pescatore)
Categories: Italian
Yield: 8 servings
3/4 c  Golden raisins
1/4 c  Diced candied orange peel
1/4 c  Diced candied lemon peel
4 ts Fennel seeds
3 tb Milk
3 tb Dry Marsala
3/4 c  Unsalted butter, at room
-temperature
5 tb Sugar
1    Whole egg
1    Egg yolk
2 1/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
2 ts Baking powder
Combine butter and sugar in large mixing bowl. Beat until fluffy,
light and pale in color, 5-7 minutes on medium speed of electric
mixer. Add whole egg and continue to beat, scraping down sides of
bowl. Add yolk and beat well, scraping down sides of bowl again.

In separate mixing bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, raisins,
candied orange and lemon peels and fennel seeds. Add half flour
mixture to butter mixture and mix until dry ingredients are
thoroughly incorporated. Beat in 2 tablespoons milk and Marsala. Add
remaining flour mixture and continue to mix just until rough, shaggy
dough forms.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured board and knead with lightly
floured hands until dough is soft but still slightly sticky, about 2
minutes. Divide dough into 2 equal portions. Shape each portion into
ball and then, using palms of hands, flatten balls into disks about
1" thick. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or grease with
butter. Place shaped loaves on baking sheet. With small serrated
knife, cut simple shallow grid pattern in top of each loaf. Brush
tops with remaining 1 tablespoon milk.

Bake loaves at 350'F. until light golden-brown and wood pick inserted
in center comes out dry, 35-40 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool
completely. Makes 2 (6") loaves, about 8 servings.
