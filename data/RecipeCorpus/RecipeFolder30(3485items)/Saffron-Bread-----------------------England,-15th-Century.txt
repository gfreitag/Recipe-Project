England, 15th Century
Title: Saffron Bread
Categories: English, 15th cent, Breads, Medieval
Yield: 1 loaf
2 ts Salt
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Sugar (Opt'l)
1/2 c  Raisins (opt'l)
3/4 c  Milk
1/4 ts Saffron
1 pk (1/2 oz) yeast
4 tb Lukewarm water
3 1/2 c  Flour
Scald the milk with the saffron. Let it cool. Dissolve the yeast
in the lukewarm water. Sift together 3 cups of the flour and the
salt. Make a well in the center of the flour, spoon in the eggs,
milk, and yeast mixture and blend. Add enough flour to prevent it
becoming sticky. Knead, adding more flour as needed, until the dough
is smooth and elastic. Put in a greased bowl in a warmish place and
leave to rise until it is double in bulk (about 45 minutes). Punch
down and shape into a round loaf. Place this on a greased baking
sheet and leave to rise until it has again doubled in size.
Bake at 375f for 25 to 30 minutes, then cool on a rack.

If you decide to use raisins, knead them in after punching the
dough down the first time. The sugar should be mixed in with the
flour at the beginning.

Good for tea; keeps a long time; good for breading fish or veal.
"Stale slices baked very slowly in the oven can be turned into
excellent rusks. Rub those with garlic and use them as a garnish for
fish soup."
