Preheat oven to 450øF.  Grease a large casserole dish.  Drain the
oysters and arrange in a single layer in bottom of casserole.  Melt
the butter and saute the celery and onions until they begin to
soften.  Add parsley, spinach, anise seed, Worcestershire Sauce, soft
bread crumbs, salt, pepper and Cayenne.  Spread this mixture over the
oysters.  Bake the casserole for 30 minutes.  Remove; and, if
necessary, pour off water that has cooked from oysters.  Sprinkle
with grated Parmesan cheese and a very thin layer of bread or cracker
crumbs.  Return to oven for 10 minutes or until slightly browned on
top.  From: Syd's Cookbook.
