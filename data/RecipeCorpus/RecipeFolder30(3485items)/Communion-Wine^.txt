Title: Communion Wine^
Categories: Homestyle
Yield: 1 servings
6    Lb sugar
20 lb Grapes, cleaned, no stems
6 qt Water
Put grapes and water in stone jars over the fire and cook until the
skins and seeds separate from the pulp. Strain through cheesecloth
and return to jars; add sugar, mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon.
Use absolutely no tin, iron, or even silver about the wine. Strain
again through fresh cheesecloth and put in jars over the fire. Do not
boil hard, but allow it to heat gradually until it begins to simmer.
Bottle at once. Many of the recipes in this collection did not
contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they
appear in the book, typos and all.
