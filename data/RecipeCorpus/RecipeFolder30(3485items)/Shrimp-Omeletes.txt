These are called "omelets" but they're really a foo-young variation.
Yummy stuff and easy to do. 1. Combine water, cornstarch, sugar, soy
sauce and bouillon in small saucepan. Cook over medium beat until
mixture boils and thickens, about 5 minutes. 2. Combine eggs, salt
and pepper in medium bowl. Beat until frothy. 3. Finely chop
mushrooms. Heat 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of the oil in small skillet.
Cook mushrooms in the oil for 1 minute. Stir mushrooms into egg
mixture. 4. Wash and drain sprouts. Remove shells and veins from
shrimp. Finely chop shrimp, 4 of the onions and celery. Mix sprouts,
shrimp, chopped onions and celery into egg mixture. 5. For each
omelet, heat 1/2 tablespoon (7 mL) of the oil in large skillet or
7-inch (18 cm) omelet pan.  Cook over medium heat until hot. Pour 1/2
cup (125 mL) egg mixture into oil.  Cook until light brown, 2 to 3
minutes on each side. Stack omelets on serving plates.  Pour warm soy
sauce mixture over omelets. Garnish with sliced green onions. Makes 4
servings (2 omelets each). From "Chinese Cooking Class Cookbook" by
