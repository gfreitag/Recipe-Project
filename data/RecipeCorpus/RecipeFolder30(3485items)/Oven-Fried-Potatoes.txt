Title: Oven-Fried Potatoes
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish, Potato
Yield: 4 servings
4 md Potatoes; scrubbed, unpeeled
-cut into 1" thick steak
-fries
1    Egg; lightly beaten
1 ts Dijon mustard
1/4 ts Paprika
Salt and pepper to taste
1.  Preheat a broiler.  Cover a broiling pan with aluminum foil.

2.  In a bowl combine the egg with the seasonings and stir to combine.

3.  Dip the potato pieces into the egg mixture and place on the
prepared pan.  Broil 4 to 6 inches from direct heat for 8 to 10
minutes per side, or until crispy on the outside and cooked through
on the inside.

4.  Serve hot.

*A pinch or two of cayenne or a shake of Tabasco can be added to the
egg mixture.

I had problems with this recipe, probably because 1) I think I cut my
potatoes too large and 2) instead of cooking them for 10 minutes per
side, I placed them so that my wedges were standing upright (I
thought it would be ok that way since both sides would be broiling at
once. Wrong!) It pays to follow the directions!  They were finally
sort of done-a bit crunchy and it took forever. My husband still
liked them, but then he used to have to eat MREs on a daily basis, so
I wonder if his tastebuds aren't shot. :)
