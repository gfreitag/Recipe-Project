Title: Frozen Figs
Categories: Fruit, Desserts
Yield: 1 batch  One cup of sugar to 5 cups of sliced or cut up figs give the best
results. First chill figs to make them easy to peel (if you wish to
peel them). Slice and mix with sugar thoroughly and then quick
freeze.  If you would rather use sugar syrup for freezing figs, use 1
quart of water to 1 cup sugar in making syrup.  Chill before pouring
over figs.  Leave 1 to 1-1/2" head space for fruits packed in syrup.
