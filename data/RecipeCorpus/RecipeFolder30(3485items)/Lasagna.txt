*I use ground turkey. **I've never found such a small can of
tomatoes; I've had no problems with using the 14 oz or so cans that I
normally find.

I also don't use prepackaged mozzarella--I buy "normal" mozzarella and
slice it up.  Heck, it doesn't always look pretty but it's getting
melted so you won't notice!

For meat sauce, in a large saucepan cook meat, onion, and garlic till
meat is tender.  Drain fat.  Stir in undrained tomatoes; tomato
sauce; tomato paste; basil; oregano; fennel, if desired; salt; and
pepper. Bring to boiling; reduce heat.  Cover and simmer for 15
minutes; stir occasionally. Meanwhile, cook lasagna noodles according
to package directions. Drain.

For filling, combine egg, ricotta or cottage cheese, 1/4 cup of the
Parmesan or Romano cheese, and the parsley flakes.

Layer half of the cooked noodles in a 12x7 1/2x2-inch baking dish.
Spread with half of the filling.  Top with half of the meat sauce and
half of the mozzarella cheese.  Repeat layers.  Sprinkle the
remaining Parmesan cheese atop.

Bake in a 375F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or till heated through.  Let
stand 10 minutes.
