Title: Candied Chicken Wings
Categories: Poultry, Appetizers
Yield: 6 servings
3/4 c  Margarine
1 c  Soy sauce
3/4 c  Water
30    Chicken wings
1 c  Brown sugar
1 ts Dry mustard
Place all ingredients except wings into wok (set on medium). Stir
until sugar is dissolved.  Add chicken wings.  Cover and stir every
10 minutes. Continue cooking until liquid coats the wings
(approximately 75 minutes). Be careful not to over cook. The sugar
tends to burn quickly towards the end.
