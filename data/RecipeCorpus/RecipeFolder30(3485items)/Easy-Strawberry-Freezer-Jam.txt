Title: Easy Strawberry Freezer Jam
Categories: ', Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
1 3/4 oz Box powdered fruit pectin
3/4 c  Water
2 c  Mashed strawberries,
-(about 1 quart)
4 c  Sugar
Wash and stem the strawberries; mash with a potato masher. Combine
the 2 cups mashed berries and 4 cups sugar, mixing thoroughly. Be
SURE to measure the sugar EXACTLY, or the jam will not set properly.
Set the strawberry/sugar mixture aside. In a saucepan, combine fruit
pectin with 3/4 cup water. Bring to a boil; boil 1 minute, stirring
constantly. Remove from heat. Combine strawberry/sugar mixture with
pectin mixture. Stir until sugar is completely dissolved, and no
longer grainy. Pour into clean, dry, freezer-safe containers, filling
to within 1/2" of tops. Cover at once with tight lids. Let stand at
room temperature overnight. Store in freezer until opened; then store
in refrigerator. Makes 4 (8-ounce) containers. Submitted By DAN
