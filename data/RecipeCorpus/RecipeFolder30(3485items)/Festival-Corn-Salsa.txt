the salsa just before serving time, prepare and refrigerate all your
ingredients ahead of time and toss together 15 minutes before
serving. It sparkles!

In a large bowl, combine all ingredients except cilantro. Toss
together. Refrigerate, covered, for up to 2 hours. Just before
serving, toss with cilantro.
