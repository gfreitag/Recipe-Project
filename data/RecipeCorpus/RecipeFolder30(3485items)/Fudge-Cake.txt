1/4 ts Salt

CAKE: Cream the Crisco, gradually beat in the sugar, then the eggs,
beaten light.  Melt the chocolate over hot water; add the small
measure of sugar and the hot milk and mix thoroughly, then beat into
the first mixture; lastly add, alternately, the milk and the flour
sifted with the baking powder and cinnamon.  Bake in two layers about
18 minutes. Put soft filling between layers & frosting on top.

FROSTING: Melt the sugar in the molasses and boiling water; wash down
the saucepan, cover and let boil about four minutes; uncover, add the
Crisco, and let boil to the "soft-ball" stage (238 degrees).  Pour
the syrup in a fine stream on the egg whites beaten very light,
beating constantly meanwhile; pour the frosting into the saucepan in
which the syrup was boiled, set it over a dull fire on an asbestos
mat or over boilng water and stir and beat until it thickens
perceptibly, then spread on the cake, leaving the surface rough. SOFT

FILLING: Melt the sugar in the milk, and heat to the boiling point;
cream the Crisco, beat in the flour and salt and dilute with a little
of the hot syrup; stir until boiling then let simmer, stirring
occasionally, ten minutes; add the vanilla, let cool a little and use.
