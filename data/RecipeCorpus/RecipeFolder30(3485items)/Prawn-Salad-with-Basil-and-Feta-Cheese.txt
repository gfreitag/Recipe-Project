Categories: Salads
Yield: 4 servings
-leaves
2    Roasted sweet red bell
-peppers, seeded and thinly
-sliced (about 3/4 cup)
1/2 lb Feta cheese, crumbled
Freshly cracked black pepper
3/4 c  Olive oil
2    Garlic cloves, minced
1 tb Ground coriander seeds
2 1/2 c  Minced fresh basil
1 lb Large prawns, shells and
-tails removed
1 c  Loosely packed arugula
Combine 1/2 cup of the olive oil with the garlic, coriander seeds and
1 cup of the minced basil in a medium-size, non-reactive bowl. Add
the prawns, cover and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or in
the refrigerator overnight.

To grill the prawns: Prepare a medium-hot fire (a light layer of gray
ash should cover the charcoal), place the prawns on the grill and
cook, basting with the marinade and rotating the prawns to cook
evenly, for 4-5 minutes or just until they are opaque to the center.
Remove from the grill.

To bake the prawns: Place prawns in a single layer, with marinade, in
a baking dish in a preheated 450'F. oven. Cook for 5-7 minutes or
just until the prawns are opaque to the center. Remove prawns from
baking pan with a slotted spoon.

Arrange the arugula and the remaining basil on a large platter. Top
with the warm prawns, roasted peppers and feta cheese. Drizzle with
the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and sprinkle with freshly ground
pepper.
