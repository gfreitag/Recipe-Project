Title: Sue Scheff's Pastry Twists
Categories: Pastry
Yield: 8 servings
Sugar
1 pk Store-bought puff pastry
Hazelnuts
Sprinkle dough with hazelnuts and sugar. (Amounts are up to you. The
sweeter and nuttier you want it, the more you should add.) Fold and
roll the dough, and sprinkle again with the nut-sugar mixture. Repeat
this three times. Cut into strips about 1/4" wide and 5" long. Twist
each strip twice. Bake at 350'F. until golden brown, about 10
minutes. When cool, paint one side with melted semi-sweet or sweet
chocolate
