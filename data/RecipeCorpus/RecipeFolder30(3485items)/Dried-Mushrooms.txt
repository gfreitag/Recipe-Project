No Ingredients Found
Mushrooms are grown in houses, cellars, or caves and are available
year round.  Most desirable are young, small to medium size
mushrooms.  Caps (the wide portion on top) should either be closed or
moderately open with pink or light-tan gills (rows of paper-thin
tissue underneath the cap). The cap should be white, creamy, or light
brown.  Avoid overripe, wide open caps, and dark gills.

Whole:  Wash and blot dry mushrooms.  Small ones can be dried whole,
including stem.  ARrange in single layer on tray.  Dry 5 to 7 hours,
until spongy and leathery.  Dried mushrooms may be added directly to
stews, soups, vegetables, and sauces.  They will reconstitute in
cooking. To Reconstitute:  Pour 1/4 cup hot water over 1/4 cup dried
mushrooms in narrow, high walled container.  Soak 20 to 30 minutes or
longer, until soft, adding more water if needed.  Yield:  About 1/3
cup mushrooms. Cook by usual methods. Slices: Cut clean, dry
mushrooms in 1/4 inch thick slices.  Place on trays. Dry about 3 or 4
hours. To check dryness and reconstitute, use same procedure as for
whole mushrooms. From: Food Drying at Home, The Natural Way
