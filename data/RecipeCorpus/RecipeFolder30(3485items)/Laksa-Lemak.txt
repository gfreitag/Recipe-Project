"Rau ram" has a strong, soapy flavor, but without it, this soupy
noodle dish from Singapore would lose its unique taste. The recipe is
from "Singapore Food" by Wendy Hutton (Ure Smith).

Place shrimp and water in saucepan. Bring to boil, reduce heat,
simmer 2 minutes and strain. Reserve liquid for use in Laksa Gravy.
Peel shrimp and devein.

Prepare Laksa Gravy. Cook noodles in boiling water 3 minutes. Place
some noodles in each individual serving bowl. Place some bean sprouts
on top, then add Laksa Gravy. Garnish with shrimp, rau ram and
cucumber.
