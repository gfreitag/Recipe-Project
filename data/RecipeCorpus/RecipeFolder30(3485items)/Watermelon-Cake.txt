Categories: Cake/cookie, Homestyle
Yield: 1 servings
1/3 c  Seedless Black Raisins --
Floured
-
2 tb Butter
2 c  Confectioner's Sugar
2 tb Heavy Cream
1 ts Green Food Coloring
Dark Green Frosting-----
3 c  All-Purpose Flour -- sifted
3 ts Baking Powder
1/4 ts Salt
4    Egg Whites
1    Stick Butter
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Milk
1 ts Vanilla Extract
3/4 ts Red Food Coloring
Preheat oven to 350 F. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together.
Beat egg whites until stiff, then set aside. Cream butter and sugar
until fluffy and add dry ingredients, alternating with the milk. When
well blended, add vanilla and carefully fold in the beaten egg
whites. Pour half of the batter into another bowl, add red food
coloring and floured raisins. Grease and flour a 9-inch springform or
tube pan and pour half the white batter into the bottom of the pan.
Gently spread the red batter on top ( the raisins will look like
watermelon seeds). Then cover with the other half of the white batter
(the rind). Bake for 40 to 50 mins, or until the edges shrink from
the sides of the pan and the center is firm to touch. When cool,
frost with Dark Green Frosting.

DARK GREEN FROSTING: Cream butter, and add remaining ingredients. Mix
until smooth and spread on Watermelon Cake. Yield: 2 cups.
