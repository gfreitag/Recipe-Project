This recipe is very simple,very fast and very good.  The fresh rice
noodles, thick and white, can be found in the refrigerator cabinet of
any good Asian grocery store.  Don't use frozen marinara mix++the
recipe deserves better.  Any decent fishmonger will be happy to serve
you with half a dozen prawns, a few scallops, some squid, a small
fillet of fish, a handful of mussels or any other combination that
appeals to you.

Cut 500 g of mixed seafood into bite-size pieces, first removing any
shells.  If you are using mussels, wash and scrape the shells and
open them by putting them in a pot with a little boiling water. Cover
and boil for a few minutes, removing each mussel as it opens to
prevent overcooking.

Chop a handful of basil leaves and seed and finely slice 3 bird's eye
chillies.

In a frying pan or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of oil.  Brown 2
tablespoons of crushed garlic and saute the seafood for a couple of
minutes. Drain off the oil and set the garlic seafood mixture aside.

Put another tablespoon of oil in the pan and increase the heat.  Add 2
tablespoons of light soya sauce and the noodles and saute for 2-3
minutes. Tip the seafood back into the pan and add 3 tablespoons of
fish sauce. Stir well.  Add the basil leaves and chillies and cook
for 1 minute more, stirring.  Serve,

Makes 3 to 4 servings.
