Title: Za Jiang Mein
Categories: Chinese, Meats
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Fresh Chinese noodles
-(regular mein)
Sesame oil
1/2 c  Chopped scallions
1/2 c  Peanut oil
1 lb Ground pork (fatty)
5    To 6 tablespoons bean sauce

Heat the oil in a wok and add the pork.  Stir and mash to break the
pork into granules.  Add the bean sauce and sugar and cook, stirring
until the sauce is piping hot.

Turn off the heat and prepare the noodles.

Bring a large quantity of water to boil in a large pot and add the
noodles. Cook the noodles until they're the texture you want, 4
minutes or so.

Drain thoroughly and sprinkle with a little sesame oil.

Quickly reheat the sauce and stir in the scallions.  Turn off the
heat and sprinkle with sesame oil.

Serve the noodles with the pork sauce on the side and any or all of
the garnishes.
