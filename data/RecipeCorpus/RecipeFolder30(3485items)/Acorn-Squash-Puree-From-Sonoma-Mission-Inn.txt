=========================== > Directions < ======================

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the squash in half lengthwise,
scrape out the seeds, place cut side down on a baking sheet and bake
until soft, about 1 hour.

When cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh into a mixing bowl
and mash well. Add the tofu and blend thoroughly. In another bowl
beat the egg and egg whites lightly, then add the squash mixture,
spices, honey pepper, and butter. Mix well.

Turn the puree into a shallow 1 quart baking dish. If preparing ahead
to this point, cover the dish with wax paper.

Bake for 30 minutes. Serve hot, sprinkled with additional cinnamon,
allspice or nutmeg (or all three) if desired.
