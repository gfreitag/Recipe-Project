Baked Chicken (Microwave)

lemon juice garlic powder onion powder salt pepper basil or tarragon
or dill Worcestershire sauce

Place chicken on a plate.  Sprinkle bottom with lemon juice, garlic
powder,onion powder, salt, pepper, crumbled basil or tarragon or
dill, and Worcestershire.  Turn and do the same on the top.  Cover
with plastic wrap, leaving one side unsealed for venting.  Microcook
on high 3 minutes.

If you're doing more than one piece of chicken, make sure you arrange
the pieces of chicken on the plate so the meatier portions are toward
the outside of the plate.  Add time a little at a time until you get
the hang of  how long it'll take you to cook the quantity of chicken
you're preparing.
