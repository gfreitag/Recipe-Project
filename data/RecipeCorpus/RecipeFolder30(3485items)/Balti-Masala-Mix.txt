Categories: Herbs/spice, ', Indian, Balti
Yield: 200 servings
1/8 oz Lovage seeds (celery ok)
1/8 oz Wild onion seeds (kalonji)
1/8 oz Cloves; whole
1/16 oz Dry fenugreek leaves
1/16 oz Dry bay leaves
1/16 oz Dry curry leaves
1 3/4 oz Coriander seeds
1 oz White cummin seeds
1/2 oz Cassia bark; pieces
1/3 oz Fennel seeds
1/3 oz Black mustard seeds
1/3 oz Green cardamon seeds
1/8 oz Fenugreek seeds
MMMMM-----------------------GROUND SPICES----------------------------
1/3 oz Ginger powder
1/3 oz Ground chillies
3/4 oz Turmeric
3/4 oz Garlic powder
To get the green cardamom seeds, you should procure green cardamom
pods and remove the seeds by splitting open the pods - you should
weigh the seeds only.

Place the whole spices in a pan in a pre-heated 160C/325F/Gas 3 oven
and dry roast until they give off their aroma. (10 mins is usually
sufficient). the spices should not blacken - a light brown at most
should suffice. Allow to cool.

When cool, grind finely in a coffee grinder or spice mill and mix
with the ready ground spices. Store in a tightly sealed container
away from light in a cool place for up to six months and use as
required.
