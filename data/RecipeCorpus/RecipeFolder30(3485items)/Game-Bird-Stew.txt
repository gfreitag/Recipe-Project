peas, peppergrass seeds, cayenne, coltsfoot ash, and lemon juice at
the end of the first hour.  Continue to simmer for another hour.  Do
not allow to boil.

Remove meat and vegetables from stock and keep warm.  Bring the stock
to a rapid boil.  Boil for 20 minutes.  Strain.

Place flour in a small screw top jar.  Add cold water, cover, and
shake to blend thoroughly.  Slowly pour this mixture into the stock
while stirring. Cook over moderate heat to thicken as desired. Return
solid food to thickened stock and serve over steamed rice.
