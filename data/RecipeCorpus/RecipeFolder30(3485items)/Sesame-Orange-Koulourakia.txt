Title: Sesame-Orange Koulourakia
Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts, Greek, Vegetarian
Yield: 32 cookies
1 ts Baking soda
2 c  All-purpose flour
6 tb Sesame seeds
3/4 c  Orange juice concentrate
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
1 ts Grated orange peel
1 ts Cognac
Using electric mixer, beat together orange juice concentrate, oil,
orange peel, and cognac.  Sift together baking powder and flour; add
to orange juice mixture and blend in thoroughly.  Cover dough and
chill at least one hour.

To shape koulourakia, break off pieces of dough the size of small
walnuts and roll into ropes about 8 inches long.  Bend each rope in
half, and twist the ends around each other.  Lightly roll each cookie
in sesame seeds, pressing slightly to make seeds stick to dough.
Place cookies on ungreased baking sheet and bake in preheated 350
degree F. oven for about 20 minutes, or until koulourakia are lightly
browned.

Remove from baking sheets and cool completely before storing in an
airtight container.
