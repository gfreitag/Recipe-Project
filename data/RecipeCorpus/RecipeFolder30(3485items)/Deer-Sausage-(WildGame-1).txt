Title: Deer Sausage (WildGame 1)
Categories: Game, Herbs/spice, Homemade, Sausage
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 oz Allspice, ground
1/2 oz Paprika
2 ts Garlic powder
12 oz Salt
1/2 lb Milk, dry
2 1/2 ts Liquid smoke
10 lb Venison, lean
10 lb Pork, fresh, lean
3 oz Water
1 oz Pepper, black
3/4 oz Ginger, ground
1 1/4 oz Nutmeg, ground
Grind together the two meats, mix thoroughly. Add measured water. Mix
spices thoroughly and mix well into meat mixture. If sausage is to be
smoked, omit the liquid smoke. You may stuff sausage into casings,
making 6-8" links, or make into patties for freezing. To cook, place
in a frying pan with a cover, adding water to the 1/3 mark on the
sausage. Boil for 15 minutes covered, then remove. Drain most of the
fat from the pan; replace sausage and brown. Make gravy in pan after
sausage done.
