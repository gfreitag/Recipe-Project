This looks like a nice dish++chicken breast stuffed with wild rice,
some veggies and crepe strips to fill in for noodles.

Establishment: Hotel Riverside Plaza Tai Chang Kiu Road, Shatin, New
Territories. Western Cuisine Practical Class Gold Award - Hot entree
Chef: Chan Chi-hung Philip (Hotel Riverside Plaza)

To prepare: 1. Precook wild rice as a pilaf with chopped onions,
chicken stock, and appropriate amount of water. When cool, add grated
Parmesan cheese and let mixture cool.

2.  Cut chicken breast portions butterfly style (i.e. slice in half
and spread open.  Flatten and slightly stretch them (by gently
pounding them between two sheets of wax paper or inside a clean
plastic bag. Season with salt and pepper.

3.  Lay a cone-shaped portion of rice stuffing on one side of each
flattened breast.  Roll chicken breast up in a cone shape.  Wrap each
cone firmly in aluminum foil (to maintain shape during cooking:  the
professional recipe calls for plastic foil wrapping, but aluminum
foil is recommended for home cooking).

4.  Blanch green leek stems, then refresh in cold water.

5.  Make 4 very thin crepes about 20 cms wide (ingredients not
included above).

To cook: 1. Blanch pearled vegetables, celery and peas, then saute in
approximately 10 g butter, adding salt and pepper according to taste.
Keep a quarter aside.

2.  To make sauce, reduce chicken stock and add fresh cream.  Cook
briefly, then strain.  Add fresh lemon juice and finish with butter
as required. Adjust seasoning and add chopped chervil according to
taste.

3.  Saute morels in approximately 10 g butter.

4.  Heat some chicken stock (5 cups should be sufficient to completely
cover the four wrapped chicken portions).  Simmer breasts in hot
stock for approximately 7 minutes.  Remove from pan, discard aluminum
foil wrappings, and saute in approximately 60 g butter until lightly
browned. Then slice each into six portions, cut at an angle (30 to 40
degrees).

To present: Treasure Hunt takes the form of a chicken breast "boat",
with morel oars being rowed towards crepe "treasure bag" of vegetable
"precious stones" some of which have spilled on the shore.

1.  Portion out 3/4 of vegetable pearls, celery and peas onto crepes
lifting crepe edges upwards to form bag shapes.  Tie tops of bags with
blanched green leek stems (with decorative knotted bows if stems are
long enough).

2.  Pour sauce onto plates.  Arrange chicken slices in a line on
sauce, lay thick ends of morels between them.  Place a crepe bag on
each plate, with reserved vegetable pearls laid beside bag.  Garnish
with chervil sprigs (or watercress or parsley).
