This sounds like a dandy brunch item.  Chipotle peppers are *very*
hot, so be warned...

Before you begin preparing everything else, pour boiling water over
chipotle or mora chiles.  Cover and let soak for at least 1 hour. When
chiles are well softened, puree them in a food processor with 1/4 cup
w or chicken broth.

Meanwhile, saute shallots in olive oil until softened.  Then add
flour and cook until lightly brown.  Stir in the herbs and slowly
whisk in the chicken broth.  Simmer for 5 minutes and then add the
cream.

Simmer sauce for 15 minutes or until slightly reduced.  Cream will
thicken. Add 2 teaspoons of the chipotle puree and simmer for 5
minutes longer to concentrate flavors.  If you want more chipotle
flavor, you may add more puree at this point.  Be careful, it's
picante. Taste, and add salt, if necessary.

Poach or lightly fry the eggs.

Cut corn bread into 6 large squares.  Put a square on each plate.
Place cooked eggs on top of corn bread and ladle on about 1/3 cup of
Chipotle Sauce per serving.

These eggs are great accompanied by black beans, turkey sausages and a
fresh fruit compote to cool down the palate.

Serves 6.

NOTE:  Reserve leftover chipotle puree for another recipe.  Or blend
with olive mayonnaise and dash of lime juice and use as a sandwich
spread.
