This is from Narsai David, a cosmopolitan Lebanese restauranteur, food
writer and all-around nice guy from the Bay Area.

Clean, peel and devein the shrimp.  Set aside.

To make the sauce, prepare the pumpkin seeds first.  If they are
unroasted, put them in a heavy skillet with out oil or butter and
toast them for a few minutes until they are crackly but not browned.
Put them in a food processor or blender and reduce to a fine powder.
Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, tomato, chiles, bell pepper,
coriander seeds, and salt and pepper.  Puree until smooth.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a skillet, add the pureed
pumpkin seed mixture, and cook gently for a few minutes, stirring
from time to time, until it is well blended.  If too thick, stir in a
little clam juice; if too thin, continue to cook until it is reduced
to the desired consistency.

Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet, add the
shrimp, and saute over moderate heat until just beginning to turn
pink. Using a slotted spoon, remove from the pan to a heated platter.

Add the sauce to the pan.  Add the lemon juice and adjust the
seasoning. Return the shrimp to the pan, turning to coat them with
the sauce. Serve immediately.

Serves 6.
