England, 14th Century
Title: Manchet Bread
Categories: English, 14th cent, Breads, Medieval
Yield: 1 + loaf
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
4 tb Softened butter
1 pk Yeast
1 c  Warm water
2 1/2 c  White whole-wheat flour
Dissolve the yeast in half the warm water. Put the two types of
flour and the salt into a bowl; make a well in the flour and add all
the water and butter. Mix well. Add more flour if the mixture is too
sticky to knead. Knead for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic and
then put into a greased bowl, covered with a cloth. Let the dough
rise for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, or until it has doubled in bulk.

Punch it down and shape it into rather flat, round loaves. Put these
onto a greased baking sheet, cover with a cloth, and leave to rise
for 45 minutes (or until twice the size). The loaves can be brushed
with egg wash, to 'endore' them, before baking, and the tops can be
slashed and pricked with a fork. Bake at 375f for 35 to 40 minutes.
