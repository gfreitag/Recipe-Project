Title: Onion Bhajias
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables, Indian
Yield: 12 bhajias

Oil; for deep frying
4 tb Gram flour
1 md Onion; cut into thin strips
1/2 ts Turmeric
1/2 ts Cummin, ground
This is probably the most common starter to be found in an Indian
restaurant. You'll find them really quick and easy to make. You must
use Gram flour (basoon). the two stage cooking method makes life
easier if you want to serve bhajias at a dinner party.

Mix the spices with the bengal gram flour (this is a flour made from
channa dhall, and is available from Indian suppliers), thoroughly and
add a _little_ water until the mixture is gluey. mix the onions into
the paste and add a little salt.

Heat deep frying oil to medium heat (I use 160C IMH) and gently drop
a ping poing ball sized blob of mixture off a tablespoon into the hot
fat. When it firms up (about half a minute), put in the nest blob.
Contunie until the fryer is full. Cook about 10-15 minutes (I find
7-8 is fine IMH) until golden brown. Remove from heat and drain on
kitchen paper. You can serve them at this stage (when you might like
to cook them the longer time as suggested in the recipe).

Alternatively, let them cool. Just before serving, reheat oil to hot
(170-180C) and cook for a couple of minutes, but don't let them get
too brown. Serve piping hot.
