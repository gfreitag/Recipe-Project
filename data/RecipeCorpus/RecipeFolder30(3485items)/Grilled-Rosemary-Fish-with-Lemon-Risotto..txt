The herby grilled fish is well matched with this elegant lemony
risotto. 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons lemon juice 2
tablespoons freshly chopped rosemary salt and pepper to taste 4 large
fillets John Dory, or similar firm fleshed fish Mix the oil, lemon
juice, rosemary and salt and pepper together. Place the fish fillets
in this mixture and keep aside until needed. To cook, place under a
heated grill for 3-4 minutes each side. Risotto 1 litre chicken, fish
or vegetable stock 2 tablespoons butter or oil 1 small onion, finely
chopped 1 clove garlic crushed 1 cup arborio rice 100ml white wine
juice and grated zest of 1 lemon 100g finely grated parmesan cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper Put the stock in a pan and bring
to a gentle simmer. Heat the oil in a heavy wide pan, and add the
onion and garlic, carefully sauteeing until softened. Add the rice
and toss well to coat with the oil or butter. Stir in the wine and
cook until it is absorbed, then ladle in a little of the stock. Stir
constantly and continue to add the stock as it is absorbed into the
rice. After about 25 minutes the risotto should have absorbed most of
the stock and be cooked and creamy. Add lemon juice and zest the
parmesan, salt and pepper. Taste for correct seasoning and serve at
once with the grilled fish. Serves 4.
