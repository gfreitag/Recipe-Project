Title: CONNIE'S JALAPENO BROWNIES
Categories: Candies
Yield: 18 servings
1 ts Vanilla
1 1/4 c  Flour
10    Jalapeno
3/4 c  Nuts; chopped
2/3 c  Chocolate chips, semi-sweet
1/4 lb Butter
4    Egg
1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Sugar
MMMMM----------------CHOCOLATE CREAM CHEESE ICING---------------------
4 tb Milk or cream
3 tb Cocoa
3 c  Sugar, confectioners, sifted
8 oz Cream cheese
5 tb Butter
1 ts Vanilla
Seed and devein jalapenos, and chop finely.  In the top of a double
boiler, melt butter and chocolate chips together.

In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs with the salt until the mixture
is foamy.  Slowly beat until sugar until well blended.  Beat in the
vanilla. Remove mixer from bowl.  With a wooden spoon, stir in the
chocolate mixture until almost blended.  Stir in flour until almost
blended. Stir in the jalapenos and chopped nuts.  Butter a 9"x13"
baking pan, and pour in the batter.  Bake at 350 F. for 25 to 30
minutes, or until the top crust cracks and the inside looks moist but
not runny. Cool. (Don't try to cut the brownies while warm.)  Serve
plain or with chocolate cream cheese icing.

For icing:  Cream the cream cheese and butter with a mixer.  Add
vanilla and milk.  Add cocoa and two cups powdered sugar.  Blend in
well. Add remaining powdered sugar and mix to desired spreading
consistency. Frost the brownies.

Note:  Ten jalapenos may seem scary, but that's what the recipe calls
for, and that's what we used.  The brownies were very moist and had a
jalapeno flavor, but were not hot.  However, this might vary from
batch to batch of peppers.
