Crispy fried chicken coated in golden oats and cheese.  Team up these
cutlets with your favorite pasta.

Place the oats in the container of a food processor, and process until
fine, 1 minute.  Transfer to a shallow bowl, and stir in the bread
crumbs and cheese.  Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and dust
lightly with the flour.  Beat the egg with the water in a shallow
bowl.  Dip the chicken breasts into the egg mixture, letting any
excess drip off.  Then coat with the bread crumb mixture.  Stack the
prepared chicken between sheets of waxed paper, and let stand 20
minutes.  Heat the butter with the oil in a large heavy skillet over
medium heat.  Saute the chicken pieces, two at a time, until golden
brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side.  Keep warm in a 225
degree F oven while sauteing the remaining breasts.  Serves 2 to 4.
