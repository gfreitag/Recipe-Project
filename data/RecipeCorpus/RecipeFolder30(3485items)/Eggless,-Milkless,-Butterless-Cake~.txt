1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Swans Down cake flour

At last--a cake that has been specially developed for those on a
low-cholesterol diet. This is a moist, chewy, spicy cake that's
perfect for snacking--one that can even hold up to "dunking" in
coffee or milk! We've eliminated all shortening and eggs, and cut
back the use of sugar to the bare minimum, so that a serving of this
unique cake has only 184 calories.

Preheat oven to 350~ F. Butter and flour an 8-inch square pan. Combine
brown sugar, water, raisins or dates, oil, nutmeg, cinnamon and salt
in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Cook for 3 minutes. Cool.

Sift flour before measuring and place into a mixing bowl; blend with
the baking powder. Stir in the cooled fruit mixture and mix using a
wooden spoon until blended. Turn into the prepared pan and sprinkle
top with walnuts. Bake 35 to 45 minutes until the cake tests done.
Cut into 16 squares.

Note:  This cake characteristically sinks slightly in the center,
which does not affect the flavor or texture.
