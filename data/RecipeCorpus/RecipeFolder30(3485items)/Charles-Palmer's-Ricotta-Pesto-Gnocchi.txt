-garnish
1/2 lb Ricotta
1/4 c  All-purpose flour
2/3 c  Semolina flour

White pepper to taste

3 tb Pesto (preferably homemade)
1    Egg
2    Egg whites
1 tb Olive oil
1 c  Chicken stock
Place the ricotta in a 12" square of cheesecloth, tie the ends into a
knot and hang over a bowl overnight to drain. Discard liquid.

In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, semolina, salt, pepper and
nutmeg and mix thoroughly. Add the ricotta and pesto and mix until
well combined.

Add egg and mix thoroughly. Repeat with egg whites. If the mixture is
too sticky, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of semolina flour. Transfer the
dough to a well-floured board and knead for a few minutes. Wrap in
plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes.

On a floured surface, shape the dough into logs 1" in diameter and
cut into 1" thick pieces. Transfer to a floured tray and chill 15-20
minutes.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and add the olive
oil. Add the gnocchi a few at a time. When they rise to the top, cook
for 1 minute and remove with a slotted spoon. The gnocchi should be a
bit firm.

Meanwhile, make the garlic broth by cooking the chicken stock, garlic,
carrot, onion and celery for 30 minutes. Strain and stir in the
butter.

To serve, place gnocchi in individual serving dishes. Cover with a few
tablespoons of the garlic broth and garnish with basil, tomato,
Parmesan cheese and pine nuts.
