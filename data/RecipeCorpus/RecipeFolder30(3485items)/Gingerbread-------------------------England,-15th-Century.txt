From "Two Fifteenth-century Cookery Books" "Gyngerbrede: Take quart of
hony, & sethe it, & skeme it clene; take Safroun, pouder Pepir, &
throw ther-on; take gratyd Brede, & make it so chargeaunt that it wol
be y-lechyd; then take pouder canelle, & straw ther-on y-now; then
make yt square, lyke as thou wolt leche yt, take when thou hast
lechyst hyt, and caste Box leves a-bouyn, y-stykyd ther-on, on
clowys. And if thou wolt have it Red, coloure it with Saunderys
y-now."
