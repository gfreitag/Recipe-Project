Categories: Italian, Breads

I'm not much of a baker, but these recipes for an Italian bread and
sauteed greens to stuff in it sounded good...

Mix flour, salt and baking powder in a large bowl.  Make a well in the
center and pour in the olive oil and a little of the milk-water
mixture. Start to mix the dough with a fork, gradually adding the
rest of the liquid; you probably will need extra water, depending on
the absorbency of the flour.

When the dough has come together and leaves the sides of the bowl
clean, form it into a rough ball and put it on a very lightly floured
surface. Knead until it is smooth, about 10 minutes.  Let rest for 10
to 30 minutes, at your convenience.

When the dough has rested divide it into small balls, each about the
size of a plum.  Roll each ball out into a flat circle about 1/8-inch
thick. Now put the heavy pan or bakestone on medium heat.  Let the
pan become hot enough to make a drop of water dance.

Put the first piadina in the pan and press down with a wooden
spatula. Let cook on one side for 20 seconds or so++when you lift it
to turn it over it should have whitened, and there will be the faint
beginnings of small brown scorch marks.  Repeat with the second side
and turn the bread 2 or 3, times during cooking.

When the bread is ready it will have puffed up like a pocket bread and
should have small brown spots over its surface; as soon as you have
achieved this effect, put the cooked piadina on a wire cake rack and
proceed with the next one.

Serve hot, with slices of prosciutto, salami or cheese, and perhaps
olives, radishes or a little tomato for a quick lunch.

Makes 10 to 12 breads.
