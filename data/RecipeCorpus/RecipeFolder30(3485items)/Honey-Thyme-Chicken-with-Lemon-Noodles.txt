Title: Honey Thyme Chicken with Lemon Noodles
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 lb Noodles, wide egg
4 ea Chicken breasts
3 ea Scallions
3 tb Lemon juice
1 1/2 ts Lemon zest
2 tb Butter
1 ts Butter
2 tb Honey
1 ts Thyme
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Preheat the broiler.  Line a
broiler pan with foil and lightly grease.

In a small saucepan, combine 2 T of butter, honey, thyme and 1/4 t
each of salt and pepper.  Cook over low heat until butter is melted
(about 6 minutes).

Add noodles to the boiling water and cook until al dente, 8 to 10
minutes.

Pound chicken breasts flat, place on broiler pan.  Brush them with
half of the butter mixture.  Broil 4 inches from heat until lightly
browned, about 4 minutes.

Turn chicken breasts over, brush with remaining butter mixture, and
broil until cooked through, about 3 minutes.

Meanwhile, chop the scallions.  Drain noodles and toss with scallions,
remaining 1 teaspoon butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper,
lemon zest, lemon juice, and remaining pan juices from broiler pan.

Serve the noodles alongside the chicken.  Add a salad, brocolli or
parmesan carrots to complete the meal.  From start to finish the meal
takes about 25 minutes total.  The honey-butter mixture can be made
ahead, or done in a microwave.  After the water boils, you're 15
minutes from dinner. Submitted By PAT BUSBEY   On   05-14-95
