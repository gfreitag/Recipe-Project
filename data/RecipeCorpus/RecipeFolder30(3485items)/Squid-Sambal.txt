This is probably the most exotic of these recipes.  No country of
origin is given, but from the name and the process it must be
Indonesian or Malaysian.

This dish has several unusual ingredients for which there are adequate
substitutes available.  In any case, all the exotic ingredients are
available at Chinese grocery.

In a food processor, purse the onion, almonds, chiles and shrimp
paste.

In a large, heavy frying pan or a wok, saute the spice paste in oil
over low heat.  When it turns dark brown, add tamarind water, the
lemon, lemon grass and sugar.  Saute a minute more, then add the
squid. Turn up the heat and cook for 3 minutes, adding water if
necessary to keep the sauce from sticking.  Remove from heat and
serve over rice.

As a main course this dish serves 3; as a side dish, 6 or more.
