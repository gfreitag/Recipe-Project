~-- Separate endive leaves.  Rinse and pat dry, then arrange in a
star pattern on serving plates.  Heat 1 tb oil in a large skillet
over medium heat. Add bell pepper strips and cumin.  Cook, stirring
frequently, until peppers are wilted, about 3 minutes.  Add scallops
and coriander, cook, stirring occasionally, until scallops are
opaque, about 4 minutes. Meanwhile whisk remaining 2 tb oil, lime
juice, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and salt in a small bowl
until blended.  Remove skillet from heat. Add lime dressing to
scallops and peppers and toss to coat.  Spoon scallop mixture onto
endive leaves; drizzle pan liquid over salad. From: Syd's Cookbook.
