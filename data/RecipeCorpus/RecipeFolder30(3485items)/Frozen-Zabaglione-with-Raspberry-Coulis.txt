TO SERVE: raspberry coulis biscotti

Whisk the egg yolks, sugar and marsala in a stainless steel bowl over
a saucepan of simmering water until the mixture thickens and falls
off the whisk in ribbons.  Pour into a clean bowl and set aside to
cool. Whip the cream until it forms firm peaks, then fold into the
egg mixture. Spoon into a covered container and freeze. To serve:
scoop the frozen zabaglione into martini glasses, drizzle over some
raspberry coulis and serve with biscotti.
