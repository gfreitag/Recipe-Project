Title: Bourbon-Pecan Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
Salt and freshly ground
-black pepper
1/2 c  Whole pecan halves
1 c  Heavy cream
3 lb Chicken
1/2 c  Bourbon
1 1/2 ts Dried thyme, crumbled
Cayenne (optional)
3    Shallots, peeled and thinly
-sliced
Cut the chicken into six serving pieces.  Rinse and pat them dry,
then lay them into a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish in a single
layer. Heat the oven to 375F.

In a glass measuring cup, whisk together the bourbon, thyme, 2 or 3
pinches of cayenne (if desired), shallots and oil, then add about a
half teaspoon of salt (to taste) and generous grinds of pepper.  Pour
the mixture over the chicken.  Let it stand at room temperature for 2
hours.

Bake the chicken until it is cooked to your taste, about 35 to 45
minutes. It will not be really browned.  Remove the pan from the oven
and let it stand for a few minutes to cool slightly.

Drain the cooking juices into a small saucepan.  Add the pecans and
cook over high heat until the liquid is reduced by half.  (What the
pecans lose in crispness, they will make up in flavor.) Whisk in the
heavy cream and continue cooking until the sauce is thickened.

To serve, arrange the chicken on a platter or individual serving
plates and spoon the sauce over.

Yield:  Four servings.
