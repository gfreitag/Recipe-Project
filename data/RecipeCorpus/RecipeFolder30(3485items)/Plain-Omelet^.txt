Title: Plain Omelet^
Categories: Breakfast, Cheese/eggs, Homemade
Yield: 1 servings
Pepper
2 tb Butter
4    Eggs
4 tb Water
1/4 ts Salt
Beat eggs lightly, add salt, pepper and water and mix well. Melt
butter in an omelet pan and allow it to become quite hot without
browning. Pour in the eggs and stir gently until they begin to set.
Now push the omelet down to one side of the pan that it may be thick
and puffy, tilting the pan to keep it at one side. Cook until just
set in the center and golden brown on the side next to the pan. Turn
onto a dish, brown side up and serve plain or with tomato or other
sauce.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
