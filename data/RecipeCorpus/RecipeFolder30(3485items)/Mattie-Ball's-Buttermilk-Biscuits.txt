Title: Mattie Ball's Buttermilk Biscuits
Categories: Breads
Yield: 36 servings
1/2 c  Shortening
1 c  Buttermilk Or Soured Cream
-
(to 1 1/2 cups)
1 lb All-Purpose Flour
3/4 ts Baking Soda
3/4 ts Salt
3 ts Baking Powder
Combine the dry ingredients. Gradually work in the shortening, adding
enough buttermilk to make a soft dough. (Instead of buttermilk, you
can use soured cream.) Let the dough stand for a few mins before
rolling. Roll the dough out to a thickness of 1/4". Cut with a small
cutter the size of a snuff box (a 6 oz orange juice can works well)
and prick the tops of the biscuits to make them attractive. Bake on a
greased cookie sheet for 15 mins in a 400 F oven.

Variation: To make whole-wheat biscuits, use half white and half
whole-wheat flours.

NOTES:  Serve filled with country ham, mayo and a pickle slice.
