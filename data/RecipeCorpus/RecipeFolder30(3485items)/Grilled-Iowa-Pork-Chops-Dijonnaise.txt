This is a pork chop recipe that will just melt in your mouth.  [It
does too.  Amazing...  S.C.] From a collection that was tried in the
test kitchens at Hatfield Quality Meats.  .

Make a paste of the mustards, salt, and pepper and 2 tablespoons
butter. Rub this paste into the chops.  Grill the chops over a very
hot charcoal fire for 4 to 6 minutes on each side.  Place each chop
in tin foil and brush with the herb butter.  Wrap each chop and place
on grill for 10 minutes.  Brush chops with herb butter and serve.

This recipe originated in the Pig Out cookbook by produced by the
Junior League of Waterloo-Cedar Falls, Iowa.
