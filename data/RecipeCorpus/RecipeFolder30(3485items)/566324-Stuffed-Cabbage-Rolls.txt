Categories: Vegetables, Meats
Yield: 8 servings
20    24 lg. green cabbage leaves
1/2 c  Cider vinegar
1/4 ts Sour salt
3/4 c  Firmly packed dark brown
Sugar
1    (8 oz.) can tomato sauce
2 lb Ground chuck beef
3/4 c  Cooked rice
2    Eggs
1/4 c  Grated onion
1/3 c  Grated carrot
1/2 ts Salt
Mix meat with rice, eggs, onion, carrot and salt.  With sharp knife
carefully slice off the back of the tough rib of each cabbage leaf,
keeping surface of leaf in one piece.  Pour boiling water over
cabbage leaves and let stand until wilted.  Drain.  Place a ball of
meat about the size of a small plum at one side of the leaf.  Roll
the cabbage tightly around the meat to enclose the filling
completely. Place filled rolls in a heavy Dutch oven or deep
saucepan. Mix remaining ingredients together and add to the saucepan.
Cover and simmer for 50 minutes to 1 hour. Add water if necessary to
prevent sticking. Submitted By BARRY WEINSTEIN   On   05-05-95
