Title: Neapolitan Biscotti
Categories: Breads, Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 2 dozen
1/3 c  Honey
1/4 c  Vegetable oil (not olive)
1 lg Egg
1 lg Egg yolk
1 ts Orange peel, finely grated
1 1/2 c  Almonds, whole
2 c  Flour, all-purpose
3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Cinnamon
Position rack in center of th oven and preheat to 350 F.  Line a large
baking sheet with foil. Butter the foil. Finely grind the almonds in a
processor and transfer to a large bowl.  Add flour, sugar, baking
powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. Whisk the honey, egg, yolk, and
orange peel in a small bowl to blend. Add to dry ingredients and stir
until dough just begins to hold together. If dough seems firm and
dry, let stand for 10 minutes to soften.

Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Add remaining 3/4 cup
almonds and knead to distribute evenly. Divide dough in half. Roll
each half into 12" long by 2" wide logs. Place logs on prepared
baking sheet. Space about 4" apart. Bake until firm to touch and dark
brown, about 40 minutes. The logs may crack.

Cool logs on sheet on a rack for 15 minutes. Transfer the logs to a
work surface and using a serrated bread knife, cut the logs
diagonally into 1/2" thick slices.  Place on sides on the same foil
lined baking sheet and bake until dry and light brown, about 12
minutes. Cool on the sheet on a rack.

These will store for about a week in an airtight container.
