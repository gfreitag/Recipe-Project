-sauce
1 c  Chicken broth
1/2 c  Dry vermouth
1/2 lb Mushrooms; sliced and

Shake the rabbit pieces with the flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper
until each piece is well coated.
In a large casserole or Dutch oven saute the rabbit in lard or oil
over medium heat, turning often until pieces are nicely browned. This
should take 10 minutes.
After 7 minutes or so add the shallots or onion and garlic and
saute until soft.
Stir in all the rest of the ingredients save the mushrooms, sour
cream, and parsley, cover the casserole, and simmer until the rabbit
is tender- 20 to 30 minutes for rabbit and 30 to 40 minutes for hare.
Remove rabbit pieces to a hot platter, then stir in the sauteed
mushrooms, sour cream, and parsley, and taste for salt. Heat but do
not boil.
Pour some of the sauce over the rabbit pieces, and serve the rest
in a gravy boat.

Serve with boiled potatoes and green peas.

Author's Note: heavy sweet cream can be used instead of sour cream.
