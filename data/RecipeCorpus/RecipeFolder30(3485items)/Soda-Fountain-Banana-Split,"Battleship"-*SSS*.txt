***Jane and Michael Stern, authors of" Square Meals" say that this is
the best banana split they ever had--eaten at Ames Ice Cream in
Maine. The banana halves are to be laid out to form a square railing
in a small tub. Inside the banana rail was a cargo of ice cream,
toppings and whipped cream. Nuts and cherries on top.
