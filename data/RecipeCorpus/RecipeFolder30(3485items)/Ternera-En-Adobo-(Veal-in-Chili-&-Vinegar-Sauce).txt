This Mexican dish is an excellent way to use difficult cuts like the
breast of veal and any ragged chops.

Put the veal complete with bones into a saucepan and add the knuckle
of veal or any other veal bones you may have saved.  Add 1 onion, a
clove of garlic, several sprigs of fresh coriander and water to just
cover.

Simmer gently, covered, for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours until tender.

Since this part of the operation requires almost no effort, it is a
good idea to do it while cooking dinner the night before and
refrigerate the meat in the stock overnight so that the fat can be
easily removed (the breast is the fattiest cut) before proceeding the
next night.

Remove the cooked meat from the stock and bone it, discarding the
bones. Strain the stock and set aside.  Wash out the saucepan.

Into a food processor with processing blade, put 3 birds-eye chillies,
seeded and roughly chopped, 1 onion, quartered, several cloves of
garlic, 1 teaspoon of dried oregano, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 2
tablespoons of red wine vinegar and a little salt.  Process to a
paste.

Put a little olive oil into the saucepan, heat it and fry the
processed paste gently, stirring, for a few minutes.

Add about 300 ml of the stock or enough to obtain a sauce
consistency: Add the cooked meat to the sauce and simmer gently for
about 15 minutes longer. Correct the seasoning it necessary:  and
serve with rice or rice and beans.

Serves 3 to 4.
