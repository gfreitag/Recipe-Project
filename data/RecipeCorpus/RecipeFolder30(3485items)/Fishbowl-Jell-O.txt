Title: Fishbowl Jell-O
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
1    To 2 pieces flowering kale
-or similar decorative green
4 oz To 6 oz Red-hots or Nerds
6    To 12 Swedish gummi fish
1 sm Round fishbowl, either new
Or -- *very*  well-cleaned
2 pk To 3 Blue Jell-O, depending
-on capacity of fishbowl
Mix the Jell-O according to "basic" package directions, not
quick-set. Pour the red-hots or Nerds (or similar, "gravel-like"
candies) into the bottom of the clean, dry fishbowl.  Pour the Jell-O
in to fill the bowl halfway, then insert greens to resemble
decorative aquarium plants. Refrigerate until soft-set.

When the Jell-O is soft set, you can begin to place the fish by
poking them gently down into the mix with toothpicks.  When they're
all in place, carefully pour the remaining Jell-O in and refrigerate
until firmly set.

The small-ish fishbowls are best and you can make several for a group.
