Crust: Mix together flours and salt. Stir in oil and mix in water.
Chill dough while making filling.

Filling: In a large saucepan, bring vegetable broth to a boil over
medium-high heat. Add potatoes, cover and cook 5 minutes. Add carrots,
onions, and celery. Cover and cook 3 minutes. Add peas and-or corn and
mushrooms. Cover and cook 2 minutes or until tender.

Combine flour, pepper and poultry seasoning. Add soy milk or water
and beat together well. Gradually add to vegetable mixture, stirring
well. Over medium-high heat, stir constantly for about 3 minutes, or
until mixture is thickened and bubbly. Remove from heat, stir in
tofu, and salt to taste.

To assemble: Heat oven to 350'F. Roll out dough to fit over the top
of a 9" square casserole dish. Spoon tofu-vegetable mixture into
casserole dish and cover with crust, cutting off any extra dough and
folding over and pinching edges to seal. Cut 4 or 5 slits on top.
Bake for about 40 minutes, or until crust is done.
