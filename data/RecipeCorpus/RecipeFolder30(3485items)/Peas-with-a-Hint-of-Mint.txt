Title: Peas with a Hint of Mint
Categories: Kids
Yield: 4 portions
Sprig of fresh mint
1 c  Water
2/3 c  Shelled fresh peas
1/2 c  Trimmed green beans
Put all ingredients in a saucepan and simmer for 10 minutes. Drain,
remove the mint, and puree the vegetables in a food mill to get rid
of the indigestible husks from the peas. Add water or formula, as
needed. In addition to perking up the flavor of the vegetables, mint
is well-known carminative, and can help relieve baby's painful gas or
colic.
