Categories: Medieval, West europe, Appetizers, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 varies
Sharp Mustard
Brie
Honey
... With a sharp knife dipped in warm water, cut the chilled brie
into bite-sized wedges or artistic shapes appropriate for
finger-picking. Cut each piece horizontally in half, placing sheese
rind at the bottom. With a spoon or cake decorator having a small
nozzle, drizzle one small line of honey and one line of sharp mustard
on each piece.
Arrange the brie on a prechilled platter and keep refrigerated until
immediately before serving; otherwise the honey and mustard tend to
melt...
