Title: Peanut Dressing
Categories: Poultry, Dress/stuff
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Melted butter
1    Egg yolk
2 c  Shelled peanuts
1 1/2 c  Toasted bread crumbs
Broth from fowl

The peanuts should be crisply parched, which means that usually they
will need to be put into the oven and crisped somewhat before using.
Grind the peanuts and add the bread crumbs, melted butter and egg
yolk. The original recipe calls for no liquid, but we found it
necessary to moisten the dressing somewhat with broth obtained by
cooking the neck and giblets of the fowl.  We also seasoned the
dressing with salt and pepper.

If the chicken is very fat leave out the butter, as there is plenty
of fat in the peanuts.  This dressing is a favorite in Charleston for
chicken and turkey.  For turkey, double the recipe.
