Fat grams    per serving:
breast halves to thickness of about 1/4 to 3/8 inch.  Put flour on a
plate. Heat butter and oil over medium to high heat until foam
subsides. Dip each breast in flour individually (do not flour ahead
of time) and slip each into the hot fat.  Cook two or three minutes
on each side, regulating heat so fat does not burn.  Breast halves
should be a light, golden color. Cook breast halves in batches,
salting and peppering each breast after it is turned. Remove breast
halves to a platter and keep warm. 2) If more than about 2
tablespoons of fat remains, tilt the skillet and remove the excess.
Saute the garlic over medium heat until wilted but not browned. Add
1/2 cup of Marsala and reduce by about one half. Add remaining 1/4
cup Marsala and reduce another minute or two. Add remaining butter
and whisk to incorporate into sauce. 3) Turn chicken breasts in sauce
and serve.
