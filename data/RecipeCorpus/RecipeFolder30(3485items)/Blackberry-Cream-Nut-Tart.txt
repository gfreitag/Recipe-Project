To make crust: Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Combine flour and salt in
medium bowl. Cut in shortening using pastry blender or 2 knives until
all flour is blended in to form pea sized chunks.

Sprinkle with water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Toss lightly with fork
until dough will form a ball. Press between hands to form 5- to
6-inch "pancake."

Flour rolling surface and rolling pin lightly. Roll dough into
circle. Trim 1 inch larger than upside-down 9-inch tart pan with
removable sizes. Loosen dough carefully. Fold into quarters.  Flour
tart pan lightly. Unfold dough and press into tart pan.  Trim edge
even with top of rim. Prick bottom and sides thoroughly with fork 50
times to prevent shrinkage. Cover edge with double layer of foil to
prevent over browning.

Bake 10 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool to room
temperature.

To make cream cheese filling: Combine cream cheese, condensed milk,
powdered sugar and lemon juice in small bowl.  Beat at low speed of
electric mixer until creamy. Place white chocolate chips and nuts in
food processor work bowl. Process until finely chopped. Blend into
cheese mixture. Spread in bottom of cooled baked tart shell.

To make fruit filling: Combine blackberries, sugar, cornstarch and
boysenberry syrup in medium saucepan. Cook and stir on medium heat
until mixture is thickened and clear. Remove from heat. Stir in
butter, lemon juice and salt. Transfer to bowl. Cool to room
temperature. Spoon over cheese filling.

To make topping: Sprinkle nuts over fruit filling in lattice fashion.

To garnish: Combine powdered sugar, shortening, vanilla, butter
flavoring and 3 tablespoons cream in medium bowl. Beat until smooth,
adding more cream, if needed, for desired consistency. Spoon into
decorator bag fitted with desired tip.  Form decorative border around
edge of tart.

Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours. Remove rim. Cut into servings.  Refrigerate
leftovers.

Notes: Use 9-inch pie plate if tart pan is unavailable.

If tart is refrigerated longer than 2 hours, let stand at room
temperature for a few minutes before serving.
