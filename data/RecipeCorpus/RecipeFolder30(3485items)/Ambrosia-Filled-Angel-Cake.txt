Title: Ambrosia Filled Angel Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 10 servings
1 c  Strawberries, sliced
1/4 c  Shredded coconut meat
1/2 c  Blueberries
1    Kiwi fruit
1 lg Angel food cake
Ambrosia Filling
3 c  Heavy cream
1/3 c  Confectioner's sugar
3 c  Crushed pineapple, drained
* Purchase a large angel food cake, or use a homemade one.

Starting 1 inch down from top, slice the top from cake. Lay aside to
use later. Using a serrated knife and a spoon, cut out the inside of
the cake, leaving a wall around all sides. Do not cut through to
bottom. You will be using the cavity for the filling.

FILLING: Whip the cream and the confectioner's sugar until slightly
stiff peaks form. Using half the cream, gently fold in the fruit and
coconut, leaving out a few blueberries and the kiwi fruit for the
top. Stuff the cavity with this fruit filling. Replace the top you
earlier cut away. Spread the remaining whipped cream on top and sides
of cake; sprinkle a few blueberries around and decorate with
overlapping slices of the thinly cut kiwi fruit. Decorate with any
other fruit you prefer, and chill for a minimum of 4 hours.
