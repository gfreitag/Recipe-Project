This one isn't for the barby, but I thought I'd pass it on anyway.
Don't be deceived by the simplicity of this recipe.  It's one of the
very best sweet and sour rib recipes I've run across as well as being
one of the easiest. The taste of the ribs shines through rather than
being overwhelmed as it often is with more complex sweet and sour
recipes.

Combine and sugar and water in a 2-quart stainless steel saucepan and
bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring until the sugar
dissolves. Increase the heat to high and cook briskly, uncovered, for
5 minutes or until the syrup reaches 200F on a candy thermometer.
Reduce the heat to low, stir in the soy sauce, molasses, galangal,
cilantro, and pepper, and simmer for 3 minutes.  Remove from the
heat; let cool.

Strain the sauce through a fine sieve set over a bowl.  Sauce will
keep at room temperature for 2 to 3 months if tightly covered.
