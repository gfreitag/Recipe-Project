Title: Indonesian-Style Yogurt Rice
Categories: Indonesian, Rice
Yield: 1 servings
-grated
1 c  Milk (240ml)
1 c  Plain yogurt, room
-temperature (1/2 pt.)
Salt & pepper
1 c  Arborio rice (240g)
1/2 ts Saffron threads
1 md Onion, minced
2    Garlic cloves, minced
3 tb Oil
1    Inch piece fresh ginger,
It's only touted as "Indonesian-style" but what the hay...

As is the case with most Southeast Asian and South African yellow rice
dishes, the coloring agent called for here was turmeric, not saffron.
Yogurt appears in many Indian saffron dishes, however, and I suspected
saffron would work well here.  It does.  You can substitute California
pearl rice successfully.

Heat 1/4 cup of milk and steep threads for 20 minutes.  Saute onion
and garlic in oil.  Add ginger and rice and coat grains well.  Add
the rest of the ingredients, including the saffron.  Season with salt
and pepper and cover.  Cook over low heat until rice is done.  Serve
immediately.
