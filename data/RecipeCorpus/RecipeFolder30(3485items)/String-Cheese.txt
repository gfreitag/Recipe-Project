Title: String Cheese
Categories: Middle east
Yield: 1 servings
Black caraway seeds
Salt
1 lb Mozzarella curd
Mahleb (Middle Eastern
-spice)
Place cheese in a Teflon saucepan and add a dash of mahleb and salt
and a sprinkling of black seeds. Heat on low until cheese is melted
thoroughly. Remove from heat and drain excess water.

Pick up hot cheese in a lump, and make a hole in the center to
resemble a doughnut.

With both hands, stretch and turn the cheese to form a large loop.
Double the strand of cheese, making two strands of cheese of even
length. Repeat, stretching and looping; the more you stretch the
stringier the cheese becomes. Repeat stretching several times. Twist
ends in opposite directions and intertwine rope into a braid. Place
one end through the loop of the other to lock it.

Set cheese aside to dry thoroughly. Wrap in plastic wrap and
refrigerate or freeze.

To serve, open braid, cut one loop and pull cheese apart into thin
strands. Serve with pocket bread.

NOTE: Mahleb can be found at specialty food shops that sell Middle
Eastern ingredients.
