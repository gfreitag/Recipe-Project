This goes really well with a salad on the side, particularly an
Israeli or Middle Eastern-type salad.

Cover bottom of dutch oven with olive oil.  Dice onion and garlic.
Saute on medium till onions are transparent.  Mix a little salt, some
pepper, 1/4 bottle cumin, some allspice, a little garlic powder, and
minced onion. Distribute over chicken.  Move onions to side of pot.
Brown chicken. (If it doesn't all fit, do it a little at a time.)
Replace all chicken in pot. Pour in two times water for rice (Should
almost cover chicken. Boil about 15 minutes.  Throw in uncooked rice
(not minute rice), moving chicken to make sure rice goes under it,
but don't stir. Cut 1 lemon in half, talke out seeds, squeeze juice
into pot, then add lemon halves. Cover and simmer. Check after about
1/2 hour. When rice is cooked it's done.

In a small frying pan, heat a little olive oil.  Add almonds and
raisins. Keep cooking and stirring till almonds get brown and raisins
lighten and puff up.  Serve over chicken mixture.
