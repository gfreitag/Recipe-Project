stirring, until onion is soft.  Add paste, cook, stirring, for 1
minute; cool.

3:  Blend or process fish, egg white and cream until smooth. Combine
fish mixture, onion mixture and basil in bowl; mix well, Spoon
mixture onto mussel in shells, smooth surface, top with chilli.

4:  Just before serving, place mussels in bamboo steamer in single
layer. Cook, covered tightly, over pan of boiling water, for about 3
minutes or until fish mixture is cooked through.
