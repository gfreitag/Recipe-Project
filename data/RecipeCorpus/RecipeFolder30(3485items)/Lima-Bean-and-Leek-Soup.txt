Title: Lima Bean and Leek Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetarian, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 c  Tomato sauce or Ketchup
4 ds Hot sauce or more
4 ds Fish sauce
4 ds Soy sauce
2    Chicken bouillon cubes
8 c  Water
1/3 c  Lentils
1/3 c  Lima Beans
1/3 c  Wild rice
1 lg Leek
This recipe would be vegan if the fish sauce and bouillon cubes are
eliminated and vegetable bouillon and extra soy used in their place.
I am sure it would taste even better with the addition of a good
stewing chicken, but it was created from the materials on hand one
weekend. The lentils are long cooked until they disintegrate to form
a meaty looking and tasting stock, an effect that is enhanced  by the
tomato.

Bring the water to a boil in a soup pot and add lentils; simmer
covered 1/2 hr or more. Add the lima beans and cook another 1/2 hour.
Add the rice and cook another 20 min. Add the chopped green portions
of a large or 2 medium well washed leek[s] [They are sandy and there
is always sand trapped in the outer leaves] and simmer 10 min. Add
the sliced white portion of the leek and the remaining ingredients.
Simmer 15 min and serve. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   05-02-95
