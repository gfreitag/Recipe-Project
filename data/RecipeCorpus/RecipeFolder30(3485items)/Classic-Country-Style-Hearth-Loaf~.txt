Title: Classic Country-Style Hearth Loaf~
Categories: Breads, Low cal/fat
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 c  Whole-wheat flour
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Active dry yeast
2 1/2 c  Water
4 3/4 c  White flour
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. Mix for 10 minutes. Turn the
dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 15 minutes.
Transfer dough to a large bowl that has been coated with no-stick
spray. Cover with a damp cloth, place in refirgerator or in a cool
place (50 degrees F.) and allow to ferment for 8 hours until doubled
in size. Remove bowl from refrigerator and allow the dough to come to
room temperature (74 to 80 degrees F.) This will take about 2 hours.
Let the dough stand at this same temperature for 45 more minutes or
until doubled in volume. Punch the dough down and shape into two
loaves. Allow loaves to rise at room temperature for 45 minutes or
until volume of dough increases 1 1/2 times. Place a cast-iron frying
pan filled with water on the lowest rack of the

oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. This procedure will produce steam
during baking. Place loaves on bricks or a baking stone and bake for
20 minutes, then reduce heat to 400 degrees and bake for 15 to 20
minutes more. Cool on rack or in baskets.

Yields:  2 loaves/10 slices per loaf.
