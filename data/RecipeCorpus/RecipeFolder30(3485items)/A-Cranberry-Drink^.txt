Title: A Cranberry Drink^
Categories: Homestyle
Yield: 1 servings
1 oz Oatmeal
Little sugar
2    Glasses wine
1/2 pt Cranberries
1/2    Gallon water
1/2    Lemon, peeled
Put cranberries over the fire to boil. In another kettle, boil water,
lemon and oatmeal for 10-15 minutes. Add cranberries and sugar - just
enough so as not to take away the acid of the fruit. Add wine. Boil
for 20 minutes, strain and serve cold.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
