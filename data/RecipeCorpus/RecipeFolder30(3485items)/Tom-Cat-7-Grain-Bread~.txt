Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 c  Water -- at room
Temperature
1 ts Salt
1 ts Vegetable oil
1 c  7-grain mix (recipe
Follows)
1/2 tb Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
3 c  Unbleached flour
2/3 c  Whole-wheat flour
1/4 c  Oat flour
1/4 c  Rye flour
MMMMM------------------------7 GRAIN MIX-----------------------------
1/3 c  Rolled oats
2 tb Sunflower seeds
2 tb Flax seed
3 tb Bulgur wheat
2 tb White buckwheat
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water. Let stand for
10 minutes. In a large bowl, combine yeast, unbleached flour,
whole-wheat flour, oat flour, rye flour, 1 1/2 cups water, salt and
oil. Blend with a wooden spoon until dough is too hard to continue.
Turn out onto a floured surface and knead the dough for 10 minutes.
Pour the 7-Grain Mix over the dough and knead in for 5 minutes or
until the dough is smooth, elastic and strong. Transfer dough to a
large bowl that has been coated with no-stick spray. Cover with a
damp cloth and let rise in a warm place (75 degrees F.) for 2 hours
until doubled in size. Punch the dough down gently and shape into a
loaf for baking directly on bricks or a stone, or place in a 9 x
5-inch non-stick loaf pan. Allow dough to rise again for 1 1/2 hours
and bake at 375 degreesF. for 35 to 40 minutes. (All flours are
approximate measures. You may use more or less, depending on the
weight and absorbency of your flour.) Yields: 1 loaf/20 slices.
