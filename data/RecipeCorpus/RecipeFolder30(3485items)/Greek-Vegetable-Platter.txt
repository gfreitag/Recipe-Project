Title: Greek Vegetable Platter
Categories: Vegetables, Breakfast
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Olive oil
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1    Scallion; sliced
1 lg Bunch fresh dill; chopped
2 tb Ouzo (optional)
1 lg Leek
2    Carrots; peeled
2 md Potatoes; peeled
10 oz Artichoke hearts, quartered
-- fresh or frozen
1 lg Lemon; juiced
Slice leek lengthwise, then crosswise into 1-1/2 inch pieces.  Rinse
well to remove all traces of sand.  Cut carrots and potatoes into
large chunks. Place leeks, carrots, potatoes, and artichoke hearts
into a large baking pan.  Add lemon juice, olive oil, and a little
salt and pepper. Scatter chopped dill and sliced scallions evenly
over vegetables, then sprinkle ouzo over.  Add enough water to the
pan to almost cover vegetables.

Cover pan and bake in a moderate oven (about 350 F) for 1-1/2 to 2
hours, or until vegetables are tender.  Remove vegetables and arrange
attractively on a serving platter.  Liquid in baking pan may be
thickened with a bit of cornstarch or flour and served over hot
vegetables, -OR- serve vegetables without thickened sauce, either
warm or slightly chilled. Fresh crusty bread as an accompaniment is
mandatory -- ask any Greek!
