egg, candied ginger, and salt and pepper.

Wash and dry the chicken(s).  Rub the skin with ground giner and
season with salt and pepper. Stuff the bird(s). Place breast-side up
in a roasting pan just slightly larger than chicken(s). Pour shrry
over and place in oven. (Figure 25 minutes per pound for cooking
time.) After 15 minutes, pour the apricot juice over and baste with
the surrounding juices. Roast 15 minutes longer, then smeal the
bird(s)'s skin with honey and surround them with the apricots. (If
you are cooking a large bird, add apricots about 20 minutes before
chicken is cooked.) Baste with the apricot juice and surrounding
juices. For smaller chickens, baste one more time; for larger one,
continue to baste every 15 minutes. When chickens are cooked, remove
to platter and let stand 10 minutes before carving. Serve juices on
the side.

A golden bird the color of Leo, which relates to the warmth and
energy of the incandescent Sun.  Serve this glorious dish with boiled
new potatoes and a green salad, and with the apricot juices that
surround the chicken in place of gravy.
