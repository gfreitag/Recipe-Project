Title: Zrazy:  Horseradish and Mushroom-Filled Sausages
Categories: Homemade, Sausage
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 ts Pepper
3/4 c  Finely chopped onion
2 tb Butter
1 1/2 ts Prepared horseradish
1/2 c  Dried mushrooms
1 sl Rye bread, crust removed
1 c  Beef stock
1 lb Lean ground beef
1 ts Salt
Russians serve these zrazy for any meal.  Fresh mushrooms may be
substituted for the dried.

Soak the mushrooms and bread in the stock for 30 minutes, squeeze
them dry, finely chop, and set aside.

Melt the butter in a large skillet over low heat and saute the onions
until golden.  Stir in the mushrooms and bread and remove from heat.
Mix in the horseradish.

Knead together the beef and salt and pepper, and form into 8 very thin
patties.

Spoon a tablespoonful of onion-mushroom mixture on each patty.  Place
the patties on pieces of plastic wrap, about 3" longer than the
patty. Wrap the plastic wrap around each patty, forming it into a
cylinder shape, enclosing and sealing the filling inside the sausage
roll.  The wrap is used to shape the sausages and is removed before
cooking.

The sausages may be sauteed, steamed, barbequed, or baked.  They are
delicious sauteed, then served over pasta with gravy made from the
reserved beef stock.
