An early recipe for macaroni served with a sauce, rather than baked.
From "Miss Parloa's New Cookbook" (1884), by Marla Parloa.

Scald milk in double boiler. In bowl, rub flour and butter together
and whisk into milk. Stir over heat until thickened. Stir in salt,
pepper to taste, cayenne, cream, cheese and mustard. (This can also
be done in saucepan, if watched carefully.)

Cook macaroni according to package directions. Drain well and arrange
in serving dish. Stir in sauce and serve.
