Reserve cooking liquid in case you need more liquid. This may be
difficult to roll through the hand machine the first time. Simply
repeat at the widest setting until it runs through smoothly.. Don't
be too quick to add additional liquid. Dust with flour as it comes
out of the extruder to prevent sticking.
