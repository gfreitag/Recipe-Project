Title: Chicken & Green Chile Enchiladas
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Tex/mexican
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Whipping cream
3 c  Diced cooked chicken
1 sm Tomato; seeded and chopped
2 c  (8 oz) shredded jack cheese
1 c  (4 oz) shredded Cheddar
Sour cream (optional)
Sliced ripe olives-optional
8-10 small flour tortillas
-each about 6" in diameter
1 tb Salad oil
1 md Onion; thinly sliced
1/2 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Dry oregano
1    Can (4 oz) diced green chile
Stack tortillas, wrap in foil, and place in a 350F oven until heated
through (about 15 minutes).  [I have a gas stove and I heat each
individual tortilla over the burner.  Maybe half a minute on each
side, making sure that you move the tortilla around so that it all
gets warm and so that you don't get scorch spots.]

Meanwhile, heat oil in a wide frying pan over medium heat.  Add onion,
cumin, and oregano; cook, stirring often, until onion is soft (about
10 minutes).  Stir in chiles and cream.  Boil over high heat,
stirring often, until thickened (about 2 minutes).  Add chicken and
tomato; remove from heat and stir in 1 cup of the jack cheese.

Spoon an equal amount of chicken filling on each tortilla; roll up
tortillas and place, seam sides down, in a single layer in a lightly
greased 8- by 12-inch baking dish.  Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese and
remaining 1 cup jack cheese.  Bake in a 425F oven until cheese is
melted and enchiladas are heated through (12 to 15 minutes).  Garnish
with sour cream and olives, if desired.
