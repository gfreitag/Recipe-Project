Separate the broccoli florets from the stalks. With a vegetable
peeler or a small, sharp knife, remove the coarse outer layer of the
stalks to reveal the pale green, tender heart. Cut the stalks into
1/2" lengths. Cut the florets into pieces approximately the same size
as teh stems, but keep them separate. You should have about 1 pound
of broccoli after trimming.

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over moderately low heat. Add
the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the hot
pepper flakes (use the full 1/4 teaspoon if you want it really
peppery), broccoli stems, and 1 tablespoon of chicken stock. Cover
and cook until the broccoli stems are almost tender, about 5-7
minutes; add a bit more stock if necessary to keep the stems from
sticking. Add the florets and the remaining tablespoon of stock;
cover and cook until tender, about 5 minutes, shaking the skillet
occasionally so that the broccoli cooks evenly. Transfer the broccoli
to a warm serving bowl; sprinkle with cheese and salt to taste (be
careful; the cheese is salty). Toss again, then serve.
