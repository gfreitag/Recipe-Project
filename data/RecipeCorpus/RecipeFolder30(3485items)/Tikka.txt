This is a great favourite. The real way to cook it is in a tandoor,
but it is almost as good over charcoal and you can also use the grill
(broiler). You can make them with any of the suggested ingredients
shown above.

Discard any fat, skin or shell, then cube the meat. Make a puree in
the blender, of the onion, tomato puree, salt and spices, adding a
little water to help them blend together, if needed.

Put the meat/fish cubes into the puree, and work it in with your
fingers. Cover the container with cling film and leave to marinate a
minimum of four hours, overnight if possible.

Thread the meat on skewers and cook over charcoal grill.
Alternatively, you can cover the grill pan rack with foil, then place
the individual tikkas on the foil and grill at a medium heat. Either
way, cook for about 10-15 mins.

Serve with a green salad, onion rings, lemon wedges, nan bread and
tandoori chutney.
