chiles as described above in the recipe for Mole Poblano Picante.
Heat the lard or oil in a skillet, and fry first the sausages, then
the pork, and last the chicken pieces until golden. Add more fat, if
necessary. Transfer to a heavy flameproof casserole with a lid. In
the electric blender combine the chiles, onion, garlic, tomato,
sesame seeds, nuts, and oregano, and blend until smooth. In the fat
remaining in the skillet, cook the puree for 5 minutes, stirring
constantly. Stir in the stock. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Pour over the meats in the casserole; cover; and simmer gently, over
a low heat, for about 1 hour, or until the chicken is tender when
pierced with a fork.
