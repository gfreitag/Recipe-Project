Postrio's is a swank SF eatery.  I've never been there, but the place
gets rave reviews.  This recipe is from chef Anne Gingrass.  The
olive sauce in this lamb dish looks very interesting.  Might be a
good choice for the festive season rushing upon us.

The sauce:  Saute the garlic, shallots lots and peppercorns in 1
tablespoon butter until lightly browned, Add the Madeira and red
wine, rosemary and tomato.  Simmer until reduced by two-thirds,
leaving about 1 cup total.

Add the demi-glace and return to a boil.  Whisk in remaining butter a
little at a time until it is incorporated.  If you wish a thicker,
richer sauce, add more butter.  Strain sauce through a fine strainer,
then transfer to a blender.  Add half the olives and puree until
almost smooth. Roughly chop the remaining olives and add to the
sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside in a warm
place until serving time.

The lamb:  Rub racks well with olive oil and season with salt, pepper
and rosemary.  Let come to room temperature.

Heat a roasting pan or large saute pan until very hot.  Add a few
drops oil and sear the lamb racks in it on all sides until brown.
Place the racks bone side down in the hot pan and transfer to a 400F
oven. Roast to medium rare, or to desired doneness, 10 to 20 minutes.

Let lamb rest for 15 minutes, then slice into 8 chops per rack. Serve
4 chops to a plate (nap napped with a bit of sauce) with garlic mashed
potatoes and lightly cooked vegetables of your choice.

Makes 4 servings.
