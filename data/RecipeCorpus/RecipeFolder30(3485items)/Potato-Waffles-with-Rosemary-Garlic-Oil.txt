(From Dorie Greenspan's "Waffles From Morning to Midnight" (Morrow).

Makes about 6 6-1/2" waffles.

Peel, wash and cut the potatoes into uniform small pieces. Put in a
large pot with cold water to cover, salt well, and bring to a boil.
Then lower heat and cook until potatoes can be pierced easily with a
fork; drain, reserving about 1/2 cup of potato water. Transfer
potatoes to a large mixing bowl. While potatoes cook, heat olive oil
and chopped onion in a small skillet over low heat just until onion
softens a bit. Pour oil and onion over drained potatoes. Add milk to
still-warm skillet - just to take chill off - then pour milk over
potatoes. Using a fork, a potato masher or a rubber spatula, mash
potatoes with oil and milk. Add 1/4 cup of warm potato water,
reserving rest, and continue to mash until mixture is smooth. Taste
potatoes and season liberally with salt and freshly ground pepper.
Preheat waffle iron and finish batter by beating eggs into potatoes
with a whisk or handheld mixer. Whisk together flour and baking
powder and fold into potato mixture with a rubber spatula. Lightly
butter or spray waffle iron grids. (You can skip this step with
well-seasoned or non-stick materials.) Scrape batter by half-cup
measure onto hot iron, smoothing batter evenly almost to edge of
grids. Close iron and bake until brown and crisp.
