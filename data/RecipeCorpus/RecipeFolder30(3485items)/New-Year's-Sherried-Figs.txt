Title: New Year's Sherried Figs
Categories: Fruit, Holiday
Yield: 1 recipe  Place plenty of California dried figs in a bowl.  Cover with
California sherry.  Turn occasionally so all figs are well soaked in
the sherry.  Let them stand for 24 hours or longer.  Drain and roll
lightly in confectioners' sugar.  Keep the sherry for pudding sauce.
These Sherried Figs are guaranteed to disappear like the Old Year at
midnight!
