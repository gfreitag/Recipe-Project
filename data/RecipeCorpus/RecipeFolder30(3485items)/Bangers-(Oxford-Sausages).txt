I have not tried the afore mentioned, but I have this one, and it is
'almost' perfect. I have had them many times in England, and most
British shops here in S. Fl carry them, albiet frozen. Call around to
pubs ect.

Combine all ingredients in bowl until well mixed. Fry up a small
amount to check for taste of spices. Adjust as needed. Fill sausage
casings,be sure and prick casings at least once. Leave overnight in
refrigerator (if you can). I ususally poach the sausages  and then
brown. Poaching gets rid of some of the fat.
