This is an Australian recipe circa 1950 (cakes and puddings always
were Australia's forte) which deserves a revival.  At the time, most
homes always had a supply of cake and biscuits on hand, so cake and
biscuit crumbs were a by-product which needed a use.  Nowadays you
will probably have to buy a plain cake to obtain the crumbs.  The
recipe is hardly for weight-watchers but, even so, is quite low in
fat.

Preheat the oven to 190C.  Hull 3 cupfuls of strawberries and slice
them into an oven dish.  Sift over them half a cup of icing sugar.
Heat one cup of milk.  Separate 2 eggs, beat the yolks and stir into
the milk off the heat.  Add 1 cup of cake or sweet biscuit crumbs and
spread the mixture over the strawberries.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.

Meanwhile beat the 2 egg whites until stiff then fold in 4
tablespoons of castor sugar.  Remove the pudding from the oven and
pile this meringue on top of it in peaks, or swirls.

Bake in a slow (130C) oven for 15 to 20 minutes.

Makes 6 servings.
