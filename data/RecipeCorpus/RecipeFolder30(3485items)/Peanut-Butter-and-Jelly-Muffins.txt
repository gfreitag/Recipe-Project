Title: Peanut Butter and Jelly Muffins
Categories: Muffins
Yield: 12 muffins
1 lg Egg
1 c  Milk
About 1/3 cup raspberry or
-strawberry jelly
2 c  All-purpose flour
3 tb Granulated sugar
1 tb Baking powder
3/4 c  Creamy peanut butter
Heat oven to 350F.  Grease nonstick muffin cups or use foil baking
cups.

Mix flour, sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl.  Put peanut
butter and egg in another bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until
smooth. Add milk a little at a time, stirring after each addition.

Pour peanut butter mixture over dry ingredients and fold in with a
rubber spatula just until dry ingredients are moistened.  Mixture
will be stiff--more like a dough than a batter.

Spoon 2 scant tablespoons batter into each muffin cup and smooth
surface out with your fingers until it touches the edge of the baking
cup. Top each muffin with a heaping teaspoon of jelly, then cover
with 2 more tablespoons batter.

Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly browned.
