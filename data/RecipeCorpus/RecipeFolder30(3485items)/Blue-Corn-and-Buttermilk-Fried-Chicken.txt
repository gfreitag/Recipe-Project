Title: Blue Corn and Buttermilk Fried Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 5 servings
1 tb Garlic powder
1 tb Salt
1 tb Pepper, freshly ground
2 c  Buttermilk
2    Chickens, 2 1/2 lb each
1 1/2 c  Blue cornmeal
3 1/2 c  Flour, Unbleached all
-purpose
3/4 c  Chili powder
Serves 5

vegetable oil for frying

Cut up chicken into pieces. rinse and dry. Combine the cornmeal, 1
1/2 cups of the flour, chili powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper.
Mix well. Line up separate containers for the remaining two cups of
flour, buttermilk, and cornmeal mixture (in that order). Pie tins
work nicely for this. Coat the chicken pieces in the flour, shaking
off the excess; submerge them in the buttermilk, and then roll them
in the blue-cornmeal mixture, coating each piece well and shaking off
the excess.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Heat two inches of oil in a
high-sided iron skillet.  Cook the chicken pieces in batches, turning
so that they brown evenly. Cook the breasts first, then the thighs
and legs. As each piece browns, remove it to a rack-covered broiler
pan in the oven so that the grease will drain as the pieces finish
cooking. The chicken will cook in 15 to 20 minutes depending on the
piece. Makes 5 servings.
