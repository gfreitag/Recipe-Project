This is one of my best recipes.  It can be made a day ahead of time.
Then when you have your guests in you will be free to be with them.
DO NOT OVERCOOK THIS RECIPE!

Remove bones and skin from chicken.  Place each piece between 2
pieces of plastic wrap and pound with wooden mallet to flatten into
cutlets about 1/8 inch thick.  Whip butter until foamy add oregano,
marjoram and parsley. Cut cheese into 8 pieces. Spread herb butter
mixture on cheese (using about half of butter mixture.) Place a piece
of cheese on each cutlet and roll up as for jelly roll tucking in
ends to seal tightly. Coat rolls with flour; dip in egg then woll in
bread crumbe.  Place in flat baking dish and bake, uncovered, for 20
minutes at 350 degrees.

Meanwhile melt remaining butter mixture; stir in wine and pour over
chicken.  Continue baking, basting ocasionally for about 15 minutes
longer, until chicken is tolden brown and tender.  Be careful not to
overcook or it will be dry.

The secret of pounding the chicken is to pound from the center of the
breast outward.  Just like you would do if your were rolling pie
dough. Sometime you have to do this twice becauce the chicken goes
back to its original position.  I pound, roll, flour, dunk ect. the
breasts one or two at a time for this reason. Emily Jorge
