...Rabbits and especially the large hares look appetizing roasted
whole... ... In this recipe one may marinate hare for two to three
days with your favorite marinade. If you do marinate, use the
strained marinade instead of the wine and the vinegar.

Mix the salt, pepper, and the two herbs and rub it all on and
inside the hare. Truss the front legs and in doing so, tie on slabs
of salt pork over the saddle [Note this step adds fat to help soften
the meat].
In a shallow roasting pan, roast the hare uncovered for about 30
minutes in a 450 degree F oven. Turn the oven down to 350 degrees and
roast another 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the hare and keep warm.
Place the roasting pan and contents over a medium heat. Add the
wine, vinegar, onion and stock and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes. Add
the jelly, cream, pepper (taste for salt) and quickly dissolve jelly.
Stir in the flour and water paste and let it thicken a bit before
serving in a sauceboat.
