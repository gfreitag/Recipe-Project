Title: Salmon Vina Olki (Portuguese)
Categories: West europe, '
Yield: 1 servings
4 ts Ground cumin seed
6 lg Cloves of garlic, mashed
Salt and pepper to taste
2 c  Vinegar
4 c  Water
2 ts Cinnamon
Mix all of the ingredients in a large kettle and stir well.  Add
salmon slices and stir well so each slice will absorb the spices and
garlic. Leave in brine over night, but not longer than 24 hours, as
salmon tends to get mushy.  Remove from brine, roll in cracker crumbs
or meal and fry in hot oil.  This recipe can be cut down depending on
how many salmon slices you wish to prepare, but make sure you use 2
parts of water to 1 part of vinegar.

NOTE:  Pork chops are delicious prepared the same way, with the
exception that you leave them in the brine 24 hours or longer.
