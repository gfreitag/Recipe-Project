The skinless boneless chicken breast halves should be about 1 1/4 lbs.

Sprinkle the chicken breasts on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat
the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and add the chicken. Cook
until golden brown, about 4 minutes, and turn. Cook and brown for 4
minutes more.

Pour off the fat from the skillet and scatter the carrots, mushrooms,
shallots and garlic over the chicken. Continue cooking and stirring
for about 3 minutes.

Sprinkle the flour over the chicken and vegetables, stirring to
distribute the flour evenly. Add the wine and stir. Add the broth,
tomato paste, bay leaf, thyme and mustard. Blend well. Cover and
simmer for 10 minutes. Uncover and cook 5 minutes more to reduce the
sauce. Remove the bay leaf. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with Rice
with Sweet Peppers and Ham and Broccoli Puree. Serves 4.
