Aromatic salt to taste

4    Garlic cloves; fine chopped
8 oz Onion; finely chopped

Put the mince in the karahi (wok) and stir-fry it for 10 minutes (no
fat). This 'seals' it and draws off liquids. Strain off and reserve
the liquid. Heat the Ghee in your karahi on hgigh heat. Stir fry the
garlic for 30 seconds. Add the onion, reduce the heat and stir-fry
for about 10 minutes, allowing it to become translucent and begin to
brown. Add the masala paste and the tomato puree. Raise the heat and
bring to a brisk sizzle, stir-frying for about 2-3 minutes. Add the
mince to the karahi, and stir-fry it until it is sizzling. simmer
uncovered for 35 to 40 mins. little by little, add the reserved
liquid (and, if needed, some water) to ensure it is not sticking, and
to achieve a nice creamy texture.
Add the garam masala, coriander and aromatic salt to taste. It is
ready to serve after a few minutes, but can be kept simmering until
needed. Submitted By IAN HOARE   On   05-07-95
