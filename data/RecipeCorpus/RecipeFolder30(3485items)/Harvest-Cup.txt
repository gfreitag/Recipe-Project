Title: Harvest Cup
Categories: Fruit, Desserts
Yield: 1 recipe  Allow about 3 California dried figs for each serving.  Cover figs
with hot water, and let stand for 5 minutes.  Drain.  Reserve 1 whole
fig for each cup.  With scissors, snip off stems and cut figs into
bite-size pieces. Arrange in your best dessert glasses with cooked
and sweetened cranberries (canned or home-cooked), peeled apples cut
into bits, and segments of canned or fresh grapefruit.  Cover with
plenty of sweetened cranberry juice.  Sprinkle with confectioners'
sugar to taste.  Chill for at least one hour.  Top with whole fig
that has been dipped in honey mixed with a little water.  Ideal first
course for your holiday dinner.
