Yield: 6 servings
3/4    To
1 c  Warm water
Masa dough
3/4 c  Vegetable shortening
2 c  Masa harina (corn flour)

Prepare masa dough; chill. Soak corn husks in warm water for 2 hours
or overnight.  Rinse corn husks, then dry on paper toweling. Corn
Husks themselves are not edible! Beat shortening in bowl till fluffy.
With a wooden spoon, blend in the masa harina, salt, and enough warm
water to make a mixture the consistency of peanut butter. Cover
mixture with a damp cloth; chill while preparing filling. Lay one
large corn husk or two smaller husks, overlapping, on a large flat
surface, wide ends facing you. Spread 2 Tbsp. of masa dough over husk
spreading it all the way to the right edge, but leaving one inch of
husk uncovered on the other three edges Spoon about 1-1/2 Tbsp. of
desired filling down center of husk Wrap up the tamale by folding the
right edge over filling, then folding left edge over and rolling up
to completely encase filling. Fold the top and bottom ends over, or
Cut two thin strips from another husk to tie the ends like a party
favor. Lay the filled tamales in a steamer over boiling water. Reduce
heat to simmering, cover and steam for 45 minutes.  To serve the
tamales, unwrap them and spoon on red chile sauce to taste. Note:
Cooked tamales can be frozen up to six weeks, wrapped in foil. Steam
to reheat.

Variations:  For appetizer Tamales, use the smaller husks by
themselves, using just 1 Tbsp. masa dough and 2 tsp. desired filling.
Recipes make about 35 appetizers.
