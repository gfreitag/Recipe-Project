Mix 3-1/2 cups of the flour,  the sugar, salt, shortening and yeast in
large bowl. Add warm water. Beat on low speed 1 minute, scraping bowl
frequently. Beat on medium speed 1 minute, scraping bowl frequently.
Stir in herbs and remaining flour, 1 cup at a time, to make dough
easy to handle.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead about 10 minutes or
until smooth and elastic. Place in greased bowl and turn greased side
up. Cover and let rise in warm place 40 to 60 minutes or until
double. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when touched.)

Grease 2 loaf pans,  9 X 5 X 3 or 8-1/2 X 4-1/2 X 2-1/2 inches. Punch
down dough and divide in half. Flatten dough for each loaf with hand
or rolling pin into a rectangle, 18 X 9 inches. Fold crosswise into
thirds, overlapping the two sides. Flatten or roll into square, 9 X 9
inches. Roll dough tightly, beginning at one of the open (unfolded)
ends, to form a loaf. Press with thumbs to seal after each turn.
Pinch edge firmly to seal. Press each end with side of hand to seal.
Fold ends under loaf. Place seam side down in pan. Brush loaves
lightly with margarine. Cover and let rise in warm place 35 to 50
minutes or until double.

Place oven rack in low position so that tops of pans will be in
center of oven. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or
until loaves are deep golden brown and sound hollow when tapped;
remove from pans. Brush loaves with margarine if desired. Cool on
wire rack.
