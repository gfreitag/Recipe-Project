Categories: Chocolate, Holiday
Yield: 20 servings
1 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Amaretto Or Other Liqueur
1 ts Vanilla Extract
1/4 c  Flour
1 lb Semisweet Chocolate --
Broken into 1/2" pcs
1 1/2    Sticks Butter (6 Oz) -- cut

1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Place 20 foil baking cups on a baking
sheet. Melt chocolate and butter in a double boiler or in a medium
heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, stirring until
smooth and well blended. Let cool 10 mins.

2. Using an electric mixer, beat eggs at medium speed until light and
fluffy, about 5 mins. Beat in sugar, amaretto, vanilla, and flour
until well blended.

3. Fold 1/3 of egg mixture into melted chocolate until well blended,
then fold in remaining egg mixture. Using a 1/3-cup measure, fill
cups 3/4's full.

4. Bake 15 min, or until tops are barely dry and slightly cracked and
centers look underdone. Let cool. Freeze at least 2 hrs or
refrigerate to set. Store frozen and thaw 1 hr before serving.

Serving notes: Dust with powdered sugar and serve like cupcakes. Or
remove foil, invert on serving plate, and top with a dab of whipped
cream or an Amaretto Sauce.
