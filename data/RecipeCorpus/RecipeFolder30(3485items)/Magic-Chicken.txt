Title: Magic Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Ginger
1 ts Allspice
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1    Chicken, cut into pieces
1    Clove Garlic
1 ts Cinnamon
Orange juice

Mix spices together and rub over chicken parts.  Arrange chicken
parts in a casserole dish and pour in orange juice to cover.
Sprinkle in any remaining spice.

Microwave at 70% power for half an hour, turning dish once or twice
during the cooking.

After it's done cooking, I like to pull the chicken out of the orange
juice and pop it under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the
skin.
