Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
2 md Zucchini
1/2 c  Pitted gaeta olives
7 oz Goat cheese, crumbled
12    Fresh basil leaves
2 lg Yellow peppers
2 lg Green peppers
2 lg Red peppers
1 lb Eggplant
Lay peppers individually on their side and cut off 1/2" from each top
and bottom. Set peppers upright and make 2 cuts from top to bottom on
opposite sides. Open up peppers, pull out seeds; trim and discard
white pith. Place 4-6 pepper halves on a flat dish, cover with wax
paper and microwave 4 minutes. Remove from microwave, brush with
olive oil and grill until tender. Season with salt and pepper. Peel
eggplant and slice vertically into 1/4" slices. Place on flat dish,
cover with wax paper and microwave 4 minutes. Brush with olive oil.
Grill until tender. Season with salt and pepper. Cut off ends from
zucchini and slice vertically into 1/4" pieces. Place on flat dish,
cover with wax paper and microwave 4 minutes. Brush with olive oil
and grill until tender. Season with salt and pepper. Line a terrine
or 8x4" loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving an 8" piece overlap on
each of short ends. Line bottom with grilled red pepper, cutting it
to fit, if necessary. Cover pepper with layers of eggplant and
zucchini, and top with basil leaves, goat cheese and half olives.
Continue making layers with vegetables, cheese and olives, ending
with peppers. Fold plastic wrap over vegetables. Find a piece of
wood, cardboard or foam that just fits top and cover it with foil or
plastic wrap. Place on vegetables and weigh it down with a brick or
several cans of food. Refrigerate for 24 hours. To facilitate
cutting, place terrine in freezer for 1 hour before serving. When
ready to slice, remove weight and plastic wrap. Place a cutting board
on top of terrine and flip two over. Remove plastic wrap. Using a
serrated knife and a sawing motion, cut terrine into 3/4" slices.
