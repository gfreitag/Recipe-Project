Title: Garlic and Ginger Chicken Baked in a Clay Pot
Categories: Chinese, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
Salt and pepper, to taste
2 ts Asian sesame oil
4 lb Frying chicken
2 lg Garlic cloves, minced
1    Knob fresh ginger, grated
I highly recommend the romertopf type clay pots.  Especially for
chicken. I've done several chicken recipes in mine and they all came
out extremely savory and done to perfection.  There's a unique, rich
flavor that seems to typify food cooked in this way.  Haven't tried
this one yet, but it's high on the list.  The ingredients are Asian,
the technique Western. The result, I imagine, is delectable.  It's a
very simple recipe. At least the first time I'd resist any temptation
to embellish it. Well, maybe a few fermented black beans...  ;-}

Rinse the chicken inside and out and pat dry.  Work your fingers
under the skin of the chicken, carefully loosening skin from flesh
across the breast and legs.

Mix together the garlic, ginger, salt and pepper; rub evenly under the
skin.

Brush the chicken with sesame oil.

Soak a 2-quart unglazed clay cooking pot in cold water to cover for 10
minutes.  Drain and place the chicken breast-up in the pot.  Cover and
place in a cold oven; turn the thermostat to 475F and roast for 1
hour.

Remove pot from oven and place on a towel.  Put lid on another towel.
(The hot clay will break if placed on a cold surface).  Transfer
chicken to a heated serving platter and drizzle with some of the
juices left in the pot.

Serves 4.
