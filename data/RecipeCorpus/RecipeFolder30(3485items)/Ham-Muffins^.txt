Title: Ham Muffins^
Categories: Meats, Muffins, Homemade
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Cooked ham, ground
2    Eggs
1 c  Milk
3 tb Melted shortening
1 1/2 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 tb Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Wheat bran
Sift together flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Stir in bran and
ham. Beat the eggs, add milk and shortening. Add this to dry
ingredients and stir gently, only until mixed. Pour into muffin tins
that have been well greased. Fill tins about 2/3 full. Bake in a
moderate oven for about 25 minutes. Serve hot with butter. Many of
the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
