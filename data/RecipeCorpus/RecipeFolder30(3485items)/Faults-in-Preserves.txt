Is poor or it does not
-keep.  here is a list of
-some faults and how they
cn Be avoided.
WHEN JAM DOES NOT SET
It is very disappointing to
-spend time and money for
-ingredients making
Jam, jelly, or marmalade
-only to find that it does
-not set, the flavor
It is usually due to incorrect proportions of sugar and fruit.  When
fruits contains little natural setting quality (pectin) use more
fruit than sugar. When fruits contains a lot of pectin, use less
fruit than sugar. Not quick enough boiling, us a sufficiently large
pan.  Preserve is either not boiled long enough before testing or is
overboiled, which may destroy the setting of the preserve. WHEN JAM
IS TOO STIFF Incorrect proportions, or has been overboiled WHEN JAM
DOES NOT KEEP It can be due to incorrect storage, keep jars away from
steam and in a cool dry place. A dark cupboard helps to preserve
color of jam.  Fruit was bruised, overripe, or damp. Insufficient
sugar, with very acid fruits, sugar can be used cup for cup. With
fruit otherwise, use 3/4 cup sugar to 1 cup fruit. Jars not
sufficiently filled, filled to within about a 1/4 inch of the top.
When filling hot jars, stand them on a saucer, a board, or a piece of
paper. TO AVOID FRUIT FROM RISING TO THE TOP OF JAR When a preserve
contains whole fruit, allow preserve tocool slightly and thicken;
stir to distribute the whole pieces then put into jars. TO SEAL JARS
Pour a small amount of melted paraffin over the top of the hot jam or
jelly and rotate the jar to cover the top of the mixture completely.
Let it cool then add another layer of melted paraffin. When set,
cover the jar with a lid. Aleternatively cover the top of the hot jam
with a circle of wax paper, then cover the jar with saran wrap.
