1 tb Lemon or orange peel, grated

Powdered sugar
1 c  Cherry or apricot jam
Combine milk, eggs, club soda, sugar, dark rum, vanilla and salt in a
large bowl. Whisk until sugar dissolves. Gradually add flour,
whisking until blended. Stir in melted butter and lemon peel.

Preheat oven to 250 F.  Brush a 6-7" diameter crepe pan lightly with
vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat. Pou scant 1/4 cup
batter into pan, tilting to coat pan thinly; return any excess batter
to bowl.. Cook until crepe is brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully turn
over and cook until crepe is light brown in spots, about 30 seconds.
Transfer crepe to a baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Repeat with
remaining batter, lightly brushing pan with vegetable oil before
pouring in the batter.

Spread 1 Tbsp of jam over each crepe, fold in half, then in half
again to form a triangle. Sprinkle with powder sugar and serve warm.
