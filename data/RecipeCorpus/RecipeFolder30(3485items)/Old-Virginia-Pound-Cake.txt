Title: Old Virginia Pound Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 2 servings
pn Salt
1 ts Mace
1/2 ts Nutmeg
Rind Of 1 Lemon -- grated
1/4 c  Brandy
1 lb Unsalted Butter
1 lb Sugar
8 lg Eggs (Or 1 Lb Weighed
-In Their Shells)
4 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour
Cream the butter and sugar together well. Add the eggs one at a time,
beating well after each addition.

Sift the flour with the salt 4 time through a sifter held high in the
air. (This adds more air to the cake, making it lighter.) Gradually
add the flour with the spices, lemon rind, and brandy to the batter.
Mix well, being sure to scrape the sides of the bowl. The batter
should feel quite light.

Pour into 2 greased and floured 9 X 5 X 3-inch loaf pans. Bake in a
325 F oven for 1 to 1 1/4 hrs, or until cakes spring bake when
touched and pull away from the sides of the pan.

Pound cake always tastes better the next day. Makes 2 loaves.
