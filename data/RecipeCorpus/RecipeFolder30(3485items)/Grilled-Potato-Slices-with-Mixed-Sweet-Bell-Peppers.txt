Categories: Side dish, Bbq/grill, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
Salt & black pepper
1 ea Red bell pepper, seeded &
-- quartered
1 ea Yellow bell pepper, seeded &
-- quartered
3 lb Potatoes, scrubbed
1/2 c  Olive oil
4 ea Garlic cloves, chopped
1 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Oregano, dried
Cook potatoes for about 20 minutes in boiling water until they are
almost cooked through.  Drain & let cool.  They need to be somewhat
less than *al dente*.  When cool enough to handle, slice into slices
1/2" thick. Toss with garlic, olive oil & lemon juice, plus oregano,
salt & pepper. Let them marinate for 1 hour.

Prepare the barbeque.  When the coals have gone from red hot to white,
remove the potatoes from the marinade & grill 3 minutes per side.
Place peppers on the grill too & brush with the marinade.  Cook until
they are lightly browned in places.  Serve immedaitely with sauces or
relishes.

VARIATION: Grilled Baby Artichokes or Artichoke Hearts.  Simply
substitute the artichokes for the potatoes.  They make for a great
sandwich garnished with alfalfa sprouts & toasted hazelnuts.
