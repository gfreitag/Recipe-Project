The following recipe is from "Cooking with Daniel Boulud," by noted
New York chef Daniel Boulud (Random House, 1993, $40), who notes in
the introduction that "this soup can be made into a more complete
meal by adding slices of cooked lobster or shrimp."

Warm the chicken stock over medium heat. Melt the butter in a
cast-iron pot over medium-low heat. Add the onions, curry powder and
saffron and sweat for 2 minutes, stirring often. Add the sliced apple
and sweat for another 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the cauliflower
and warm chicken stock and bring to a boil. Boil until the
cauliflower is tender when pierced with a knife, approximately 20
minutes. Add the cream and cook for 3 more minutes. Salt and pepper
to taste.

Transfer the soup in batches to a blender or food processor and puree
at high speed until very smooth. Keep warm until ready to serve or
refrigerate when cool and reheat just before serving.
