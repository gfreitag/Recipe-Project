Categories: Pastry, Potato
Yield: 50 servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
-salt & pepper
3 oz Cottage cheese, drained
1 sm Onion chopped
6 ea Strips of bacon
4 c  Flour, all purpose
Egg
1 c  WARM water (appprox)
2 ea Tb Cold mashed potatoes**
3 c  Potatoes
NOTE: ** Or potato pierogie filling. This makes the dough more
pliable and tasty! Fry bacon until crisp. Reserve a little grease and
saute onions . Drain. Mash potatoes with cottage cheese, then add
rest of ingredients. You want the potato mixture stiff.if the
potatoes aren't tasty enough add some instant potatoes. This time of
year potatoes aren't real tasty. Cabbage Filling (my favorite) 1
medium size cabbage 4 oz. DRY cottage cheese 1 med. onion, chopped 6
slices bacon salt and pepper. Cut cabbage in pieces and cook until
tender.  Drain well>> Run through food processor with other
ingredients (Cook bacon and fry onions in bacon grease first!) Salt
and pepper to taste. Meat Filling: 1 medium onion chopped 2 c. left
over meat, bacon 2 slices bread soaked in milk salt & pepper dill and
parsley to taste Cook bacon and onion. Run all through food processor
or grinder. To make pierogies: Follow the excellent directions given
elsewhere in this category.
