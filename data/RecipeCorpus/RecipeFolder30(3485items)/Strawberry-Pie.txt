2 tb Cornstarch
Prepare pie shell. Drain the berries. Slecting a few of the riper
berries, mash enough to make 1/4 cupful. Set aside. Combine sugar,
corstarch, and water. Cook over medium heat until thick and clear.
Remove from heat and add Jell-O. Mix well. Cool slightly. Then add
mash berries. Fill pie shell with whole berries. Pour mixture evenly
over them. Chill for at least 4 hours. Just before serving, whip
cream to form stiff peaks. Beat in vanilla, and mound on top of pie.
Since this is a fairly sweet pie, unsweetened whipped cream is
preferred, but you can add a little powdered sugar blended in.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
