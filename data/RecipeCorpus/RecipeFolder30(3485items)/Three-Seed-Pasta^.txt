The sunflower seeds should be finely ground in a food processor or
blender. If using an extruder, grind all seeds and use one of the
large dies so holes don't become clogged. Cookand serve immediately.
If using a hand machine, don't roll too thinly, as the seeds may
cause tearing. I stop at the fourth level of rolling. it may be
difficult to roll initially and should be run through the first set
of rollers several times.
