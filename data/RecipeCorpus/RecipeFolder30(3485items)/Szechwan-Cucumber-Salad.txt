Title: Szechwan Cucumber Salad
Categories: Chinese, Salads
Yield: 1 salad
2 ts Light soy sauce
2 tb Chinese white vinegar
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 tb Sesame oil
2 tb Small dried wood ear
-mushrooms
2    Cucumbers
4    Red hot peppers cut in thin
-rounds
Pour boiling water over tree ears; let stand for 15 minutes.  Peel
cucumbers, cut in half lengthwise, scrape out seeds.  Slice into thin
half-moons.  When mushrooms are soft, drain, rinse and dry.  (Slice
'em if they're too big.  Wood ears will quadruple in size when
soaked++SC.) Combine with remaining ingredients.  Let stand for 15
minutes then toss again before serving.

NOTE:  (Wood ears can be found in Chinese markets.  After soaking
they have little taste but lots of crunch.  They're there for the
texture. I can't think of anything to substitute (maybe raw carrots
or water chestnuts) except for dried duck web or jellyfish and you're
much more likely to find wood ears than those items.  Be sure to use
the dark, cooked, Asian sesame oil rather than the light stuff in
health food stores. I'd make this before the ribs and chill it well
while doing the rest.)

It's from the same article by Bruce Cost.
