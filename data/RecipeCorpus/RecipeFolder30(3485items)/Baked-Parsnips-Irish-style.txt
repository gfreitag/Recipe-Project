Title: Baked Parsnips Irish style
Categories: Irish, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
1 x  Salt and pepper
1 x  Pinch nutmeg
2 1/2 lb Parsnips
2 oz Butter or bacon fat
3 tb Stock
Peel parsnips, quarter, and remove any woody core.  Parboil for 15
minutes. Place in an ovenproof dish.  Add stock and sprinkle with
salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Dot with butter and bake for 30 minutes on
a low shelf in a moderate oven.  (Generally parsnips are baked in the
same oven as the main meat dish, whose cooking temperature governs
that of the parsnips.)
