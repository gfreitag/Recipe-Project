MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
Paprika
Use either fresh jalopenos or canned (which won't taste the same.)

Cut slits in the sides of the peppers, and scoop out the seeds and
veins, leaving the peppers whole. NOTE: If you're doing this in
quantity, wear rubber gloves, the oil in the peppers is strong enough
to cause serious burns. For smaller quantities, coat your hands
liberally with cooking oil if you have sensitive skin.

Stuff with the cheese and cream cheese and ground sea food, if you
wish-if so allow about 1/3 seafood to the total quantity of cheese
used.

Stuff the cheese mixture into the inside of the peppers, and roll
filled peppers, first in flour, then in eggwash, then in the mixture
of cornmeal and flour.

Allow the coated peppers to dry (re-bread if you want a really crispy
coating), and fry in deep fat until brown. Serve immediately.

For a cold version of this, use whole pickled peppers, cut in half,
and seed. Simply pile in the cheese or cheese/seafood mixture into
the peppers, sprinkle with a little paprika for garnish and serve.
