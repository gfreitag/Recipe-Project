Title: Elderberry Blossom Wine^
Categories: Homestyle
Yield: 1 servings
1    Lemon, thinly sliced
1 tb Good yeast
1 ga Boiling water
1 qt Elder blossoms
3 lb Sugar
Put blossoms in a large kettle and pour water over them. Let stand 1
hour. Strain, add sugar to liquid, boil a little and skim. When
lukewarm, add lemon and yeast. Let stand 24 hours, then strain and
put into bottles or jugs, filling full until al impurities are worked
out. Be sure to fill up jugs as fast as it works out and the wine
will be a beautiful amber color. (In making this wine, be careful to
keep al stems out, as they make the wine taste rank and give it a
dark color). Cork tightly. Many of the recipes in this collection did
not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as
they appear in the book, typos and all.
