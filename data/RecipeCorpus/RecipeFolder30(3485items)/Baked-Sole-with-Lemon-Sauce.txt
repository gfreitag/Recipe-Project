Title: Baked Sole with Lemon Sauce
Categories: Seafood, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Water
1 tb Flour, All-Purpose
3/4 c  Chicken Broth
2 tb Lemon Juice
1    Green Olives, Stuffed
2 lb Sole, Fresh or Frozen
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
3 tb Butter
2    Egg Yolks
Pre-heat oven to 350Ã¸F.  Grease a large shallow baking dish.  Arrange
fillets in dish.  Sprinkle fillets with salt and pepper.  Dot with 2 T
butter.  Bake for 10 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested
with a fork.  Start sauce preparation about 15 minutes before you put
the fish in the oven.  In a cup, mix egg yolks with water, set aside.
In heavy saucepan over medium heat, into 1 T of hot butter, stir
flour until well blended.  Gradually stir in chicken broth and lemon
juice.  Cook with stirring until mixture is thickened.  Remove
saucepan from heat.  Into egg yolks, stir 6-8 drops of Tabasco Sauce.
Slowly pour egg mixture into sauce, stirring rapidly to avoid
lumping.  Cook with stirring until thickened (DO NOT BOIL).  Spoon
off any excess liquid from fish.  Pour sauce over fish and garnish
with sliced stuffed green olives.  The olives add a lot more to this
dish than you might imagine. From: Syd's Cookbook.
