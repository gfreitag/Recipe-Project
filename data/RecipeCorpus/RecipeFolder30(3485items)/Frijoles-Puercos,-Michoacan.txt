Fry bacon in small skillet over low heat so fat renders out. Do not
let bacon brown too much. Remove bacon pieces with slotted spoon. Set
aside. Add crumbled chorizo to bacon fat. Fry gently without browning
about 5 minutes. Remove chorizo with slotted spoon. Set aside. In
same fat, fry tortilla squares until completely crisp. Drain on paper
towels.

Put Frijoles de Olla in heavy, wide pan and add whole chiles, bacon
and chorizo. Heat through gently so beans do not scorch on bottom.
When beans just begin to bubble, add cheese and chicarron. As cheese
just begins to melt, sprinkle top of beans with tortilla squares.
Serve immediately, before squares become soft.
