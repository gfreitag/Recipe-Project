Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Roast chicken 15 minutes.  Reduce oven
temperature to 375 degrees F and roast until juices run clear when

Pour pan juices into glass measuring cup; degrease.  Add wine to
roasting pan and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits.  Add
wine mixture and any drippings from platter to pan juices.  Add

Add to saucepan.  Bring to boil, whisking constantly.  Boil until
reduced to sauce consistency, stirring often, about 5 minutes.  Mix

pepper.  Garnish chicken with basil.  Serve with gravy.
