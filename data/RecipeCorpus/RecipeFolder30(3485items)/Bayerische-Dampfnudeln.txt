BAYERISCHE DAMPFNUDELN

Combine yeast, 1/2 cup of the lukewarm milk, and sugar, and stir
until the yeast is dissolved. Add the remaining lukewarm, flour, egg,
and salt. Use just enough flour to make a very soft dough that will
just hold its shape. Cover, and let rise at 85 F until double in
bulk, Mold the dough into 12 biscuits, and place them, some distance
apart, in a well-greased 9 X 13 X 2 inch baking dish. Let rise for 30
minutes. Pour in enough hot milk to come half-way up the sides of the
biscuits, and bake uncovered for 30 minutes at 350F, or until a
delicate brown and the milk has been absorbed. Serve at once with
Vanilla or Fruit Juice Sauce.

This amount serves 6.
