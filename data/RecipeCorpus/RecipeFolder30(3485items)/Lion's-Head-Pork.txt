Title: Lion's Head Pork
Categories: Meats, Asian, Wok
Yield: 5 servings
2 tb Soya sauce
3 tb Oil
1 1/2 lb Coarsely shredded celery
-cabbage (about 4-5 cups)
2 c  Pork
6    Water chestnuts
2 sl Onion (thick slices)
Salt
Pepper
1. Take your Chinese cleaver and coarsely dice pork. Dice water
chestnuts and slices of onion. Place all together on a heavy duty
meatboard. Mince with your Chinese cleaver until all three of the
ingredients are blended together into a lump. (It takes 10-15 minutes
of solid mincing to accomplish this.)

2. Place minced meat into a bowl. Add salt, pepper, and soya sauce.
Blend together and form into 4 large meatballs.

3. Place oil in wok. Heat should be on medium. Heat oil for about 1
minute. Add pork balls to wok and brown slowly on all sides, about 15
minutes. Cover wok, reduce heat to low medium and cook pork balls a
further 30 minutes, lifting cover up from wok from time to time to
turn meatballs, so that they can be cooked through evenly.

4. Lift meatballs from wok and reserve on platter. Add celery cabbage
to wok. There should be some meat juice in the wok, about 1/2 cup or
so. If there isn't any, add 1/4 cup water to celery cabbage. Stir fry
about a minute, cover and cook a further 3 minutes, lifting cover
once or twice to stir cabbage. Place cooked celery cabbage on serving
platter. Arrange meatballs over cabbage.

NOTE: Celery cabbage is a winter season vegetable. If it is not
available in summer, regular cabbage can be substituted. Increase the
cooking time of the regular cabbage to 7 1/2 minutes.
