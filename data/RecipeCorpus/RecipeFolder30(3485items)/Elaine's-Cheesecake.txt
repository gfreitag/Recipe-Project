Title: Elaine's Cheesecake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 12 servings
1 c  Graham Cracker Crumbs
1/4 c  Butter or Margarine
1 1/4 c  Oreo Cookie Crumbs
1/4 c  Butter or Margarine
3 tb Sugar, granulated
1 c  Sugar, granulated
2 lb Cream Cheese
2 lg Eggs
1 c  Sour Cream
1 ts Vanilla
3 tb Cornstarch
In a small bowl, blend well the graham cracker crumbs, butter
:
or margarine, and 3 tablespoons granulated sugar. Press the crumb
mixture in the bottom of a greased 8" or 9" springform pan. Place the
pan in the freezer to chill while you prepare the filling.
In a mixer bowl, mix the cream cheese and sugar until smooth
:
and light. I, myself, mix alternately 8 ozs. of the cream cheese and
1/4 cup of the sugar. This is just to ensure it is evenly mixed. When
the cream cheese and sugar mixture is light and creamy, mix in the
eggs, vanilla, and the cornstarch, making sure it is mixed well. It
should be a nice light yellow color. Mix in the sour cream until well
mixed. Pour the mixture into the prepared springform pan.
Bake in a preheated 450 degree oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the
:
temperature to 200 degrees and bake for another 45 minutes. Turn oven
off and allow the cheesecake to cool in the oven with the door opened
slightly for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove sides from pan and chill in
refrigerator for another 2 to 3 hours. Then slide the cheesecake off
the bottom of your pan, if you wish.

** You can use the Oreo Cookie Crumbs in place of the Graham
Cracker Crumbs for a wonderfully delightful change. (This is the way
that most of the people order it from me.)

*** Before placing the cheescake in the oven for baking, I always
sprinkle a bit of the crumbs on top for garnish. Really looks nice!

**** Last hint: I put a pan with about 2-3 inches of hot water on
the bottom shelf. It helps to keep the cheesecake from cracking.
Always bake the cheesecake on the middle shelf...NO LOWER!!! From:
