Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
Freshly ground pepper, to
-taste
1/2 c  Dry white wine or chicken
-stock
1/4 c  Chicken stock
4 tb Extra virgin olive oil
2 1/2 lb Chicken, cut-up
6    Cloves garlic, peeled and
-cut in half
6    Inch pieces fresh rosemary
Salt, to taste
In a saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the
chicken pieces, skin side down, and the garlic cloves.  Brown the
chicken and turn over. Remove the garlic when dark brown.  Add the
rosemary to the pan.

When the chicken is browned, add the salt, pepper, and wine/chicken
stock. Let the liquid bubble wildly for 2 to 3 minutes, then lower
the heat to just a simmer.  Add the browned garlic cloves. Cover.

Cook over low heat for about 30 minutes, turning 2 to 3 times until
chicken is just tender.  Remove the chicken and garlic to a serving
plate. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat.  Add remaining 1/4
cup of chicken stock and cook, scraping all the chicken bits and
juices from the pan bottom.

Return heat to high and reduce the liquid by half.  Pour the remaining
liquid over chicken.  Serve the chicken with garlic cloves and sauteed
spinach.  Makes 6 to 8 servings.
