coat meat with flour until you are ready to saute it. The flour
becomes damp, and the meat does not brown properly. Slip chicken and
sage into hot oil. Cook briefly, just long enough to brown both
sides. When cooked,remove to warm platter and add salt and pepper.
Add wine and butter, return chicken to pan and coat with wine mixture
on both sides of chicken. Transfer chicken to a warm serving platter,
pour remainder of sauce over them and serve immediately.
