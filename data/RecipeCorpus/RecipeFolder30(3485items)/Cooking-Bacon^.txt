Although there are several ways to cook bacon, the ideal bacon is
crisp, light and brown in color, and delicately flavored.

Frying: Lay bacon in cold frying pan. Place pan over a low fire. when
heated to the melting point, the fat will begin to fry out. Then cook
slowly, pouring off the excess fat from time to time. Turn frequently,
increasing the heat. When bacon is crisp and brown, it is ready to
serve.

Boiling: Some prefer to cook bacon by placing it in a skillet and
covering it with boiling water, placing it on the fire and boiling it
until the fat has cooked away, and finish it by browning the bacon in
the fat.

Oven: Lay strips of bacon in a shallow pan and place it in a hot oven,
pouring off fat from time to time. When bacon has browned on both
sides, serve immediately.

Broiling: The ideal method of cooking bacon os to lay slices of bacon
on a wire rack, placing a drip pan underneath to save the fat. Use a
hot fire, and as soon as one side of the bacon is slightly brown,
turn it and brown the other side. Many of the recipes in this
collection did not contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed
them in as they appear in the book, typos and all.
