Title: North Carolina Chopped Barbecued Pork
Categories: Crockpot, Meats, Bbq/grill
Yield: 3 servings
1/4 ts Chili powder
1/4 ts Nutmeg, ground
1/4 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Water
Vinegar, cider to taste
Sauce, Tabasco to taste
1 1/2 lb Pork shoulder roast
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Celery seed
1/16 ts Cinnamon, ground
3/16 c  Vinegar, cider
1/4 c  Catsup
Brown roast in a small amount of fat and place in a Dutch oven. Mix
the next 9 ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour over
roast and cover.  Bake in a preheated 325^ oven, 40 minutes to the
pound, until done, basting occasionally with drippings.

Transfer roast to a chopping board.  Remove meat from the bone and
chop into fairly fine pieces. Season to taste with additional vinegar
and hot sauce.  Serve hot with coleslaw and corn bread.

Sylvia's comments: I found some stew pork marked WAY down, bought
several packages ($.99/lb!) and stuck them in the freezer.  Then I
put all the ingredients, including the still-frozen pork, in the
crockpot this morning. Tonight it was done, I just mashed up the meat
with a fork and knife and served it over rice.  The vinegar produces
a very interesting taste. However, it came out kind of soupy; next
time I'll leave out the water and increase the catsup.

This is the most popular barbecue dish in North Carolina, and, as far
as we know, it is indigenous to that state.
