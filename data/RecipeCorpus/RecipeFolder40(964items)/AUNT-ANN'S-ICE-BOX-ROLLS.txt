Title: AUNT ANN'S ICE BOX ROLLS
Categories: Blank
Yield: 4 Servings
5 c  Flour
1    Envelope dry yeast
1/4 c  Luke-warm water
1/3 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Margarine
1 c  Ice water or mixed with milk
Dissolve dry yeast in the 1/4 cup luke-warm water. Mix all of the
above, including the yeast/water mixture, until firm. Place in
refrigerator over night. Next day, shape into round walnut-size
balls. Put 3 balls in each cup of greased muffin pan. Let raise until
higher than the top of the muffin pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 20
minutes. Tops may be brushed with butter or margarine if desired. The
unbaked dough can be kept in the refrigerator for 2 weeks.

This is a recipe handed down on my MILs side of the family. Aunt Ann
made them first, then Aunt Mary Mechling, and finally my MIL, Jo
Beers.
