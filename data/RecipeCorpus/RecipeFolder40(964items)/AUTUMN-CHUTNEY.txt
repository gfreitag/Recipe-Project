Title: AUTUMN CHUTNEY
Categories: Chutneys
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Plums -- halved and stoned
1 lb Apples -- peeled and cored
1 lb Tomatoes -- chopped
1 lb Onions -- sliced
2 lg Garlic cloves -- chopped
3 c  Sultanas -- (raisins)
1/4 ts Mace
1/4 ts Ground mixed spice
2 tb Ground ginger
1 lb Light brown sugar
Mix the fruit and vegetables together.  Put into an preserving pan
(Note: these books call for an aluminum pan - I just don't use
aluminum with acid food )  Add the remaining ingredients, except the
sugar. Simmer for about 30 minutes until tender. Add the sugar and
stir until dissolved. Simmer gently, stirring frequently, until
thick. (Note: how long this takes depends on the water content of the
fruits). Cool, then pack the chutney into clean jars.  Cover and
seal. PS: I always refrigerate after opening the jar. "Gathering the
produce of the season as the days shorten, as the sun travels lower
in the sky and the earth quietens, is a deeply satisfying pastime.
Making the most of the produce is a pleasure, too, and this chutney
brings several of the fruits of the season together in a
mouthwatering way.
