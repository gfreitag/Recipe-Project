1/2 c  Fresh lime juice
3 tb Peanut oil or vegetable oil
24    Green peppercorns; crushed
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
3/4 lb Sea or bay scallops

COMBINE THE LIME JUICE, oil, peppercorns, salt and pepper together in
a glass or ceramic bowl. Stir in the scallops, cover and refrigerate
for at least 4 hours while they marinate. They should become opaque
in this time. Mash the avocado until almost smooth, then add it along
with the chives or scallions to the marinating scallops (do not drain
them) and mix well. Set aside for at least 1/2 hour, refrigerated.
About half an hour before serving the scallops, remove the stems from
the mushrooms and wipe them to remove any dirt. Combine the vegetable
oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper in a small bowl, and brush
the insides of the mushrooms liberally with the mixture. Just before
serving, drain the caps and fill with the scallop mixture. Garnish
with additional chives, if desired.
