Title: ARUGULA SALAD
Categories: Italian, Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Garlic clove; peeled
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Balsamic vinegar
1 ts Dijon mustard
1/3 c  Olive oil
2 c  Mixed lettuce leaves
1 c  Arugula; stems removed
1/2 lb Mushrooms; sliced
1    Sweet red pepper
In a wooden salad bowl, rub garlic and salt into the bowl to season
it. Combine vinegar, mustard and olive oil; stir. Tear lettuce into
bite sized pieces, along with arugula. Add mushrooms and slices of
red pepper. Toss well and serve.

Ogden writes: "Italian restaurants often serve arugula on its own
with a strong garlic flavored oil and vinegar dressing. Mixed with
milder greens and a good dressing, arugula is less dominating."
