The name means simply 'fried chicken', and that is all it is. The
marinade, however, gives it a characteristically Indonesian flavour.
Marinate the pieces of chicken in this mixture for 2 hours, turning
them from time to time. Strain the chicken, so that the marinade
drips away from it. Then deep-fry the portions, 4 or 5 at a time.
Chicken fried in this way is excellent with Nasi Goreng.  [Nasi
Goreng is fried rice. S.C.] Makes 4 servings. From "Indonesian Food
