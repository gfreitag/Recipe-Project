This jump-in-your-mouth loaf stars one of our all-time favorite
condiments--Tabasco sauce, which is made only one place in this
country, Avery Island, Louisiana. Accept no substitutes if you want
the authentic version of this bread. The other special ingredients
are chili honey, which is available by mail order, and
pepper-flavored vodka, which is readily available in liquor stores.
You may substitute regular vodka if you wish.
