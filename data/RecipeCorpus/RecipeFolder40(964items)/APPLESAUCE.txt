Title: APPLESAUCE
Categories: Fruits/nuts, Sauces
Yield: 4 Servings
8    Gravenstein apples
- peeled, cored
-  and cut into eighths
1/2 c  Water
Sugar to taste
2 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Grated lemon peel
COMBINE APPLES AND WATER IN heavy-bottomed pan. Place over low heat
and cook, stirring occasionally. When apples begin to get tender, add
sugar to taste but be sparing until apples mash easily--that's when
you can tell just how sweet you want the applesauce. Add lemon juice
and cook until applesauce is ready to be mashed with fork. Remove
from heat and add lemon peel. Mash with tines of fork, leaving some
coarse texture. Serve warm.
