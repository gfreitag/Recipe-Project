1/4 c  Butter, unsalted

* Leeks: Use the white part and only 1 inch of the green part.

Parsley butter: Mix the first 4 ingredients in small bowl. (Can be
prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room
temperature before using).

Melt 1/4 cup unsalted butter in heavy large saucepan over low heat.
Add leeks, thyme and bay leaf.  Cover and cook until leeks are soft,
stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Mix in stock and potatoes.
Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until potatoes are
tender, about 12 minutes. Add asparagus and simmer until
crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Season to taste with
salt and pepper. Ladle soup into bowls. Top each with dollop of
parsley butter and serve.

This sounded very good, but my husband likes cream soups, so I added
a FL sweet onion to the potato mixture and pureed all before I added
the asparagus to the creamy soup. Adapted from Bon Appetit, April
1991.
