In large bowl combine 1 cup flour, undissolved yeast, sugar, instant
milk, and salt. Heat baby food, water and margarine until very warm
(120 to 130ø); stir into dry ingredients. Stir in egg and enough
remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead on lightly floured
surface until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cover; let
rest on floured surface 10 minutes. On lightly floured surface, roll
dough to 20x9-inch rectangle. To fill, evenly spread jam on dough to
within 1/2 inch of edges. Sprinkle evenly with apricots and almonds.
Beginning at long end, roll up tightly. Pinch seam to seal. Form into
ring, pinch ends together to seal. Place, seam side down, on large
greased baking sheet. With sharp knife, cut slits, starting from
outer edge, 3/4 of the way through dough at 1-inch intervals. Turn
each section on its side to show filling. Cover; let rise in warm,
draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes. Bake
at 350ø for 30 to 35 minutes or until done, covering with foil after
20 minutes to prevent excess browning. Remove from sheet; let cool on
wire rack. Drizzle with icing. Icing: Combine all ingredients. Stir
until smooth.
