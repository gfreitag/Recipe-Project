Title: ASPARAGUS IN ITS OWN JUICES
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 2 Servings
3/4 lb Asparagus (medium to large)
2 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 ts Salt
Freshly ground pepper
CUT OFF THE TOUGH BOTTOM END of the asparagus and discard. Peel the
stalks with a vegetable peeler. Place asparagus in a skillet or
saucepan just large enough to hold them lying down and barely cover
with cold water. Add butter and salt and bring to a boil, uncovered,
over high heat. Stir the asparagus so it will cook evenly. The
asparagus is done when the water has evaporated, leaving only the
concentrated, buttery juice of the asparagus. Grind fresh pepper to
taste over the asparagus and arrange on a vegetable platter.
