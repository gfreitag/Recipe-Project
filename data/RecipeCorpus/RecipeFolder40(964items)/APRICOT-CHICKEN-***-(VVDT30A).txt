** Sub Catalina Dressing>>>>>> Richard, This recipe came from Prodigy
BB; at the time, unfortunately, I wasn't recording the author's name.
Preparation: 1- Mix Preserves, Dressing, and Onion mix 2- Arrange
chicken in a baking dish; pour mix over chicken; 3- Marinade 3+
hours, refrigerated. 4- Bake at 325F-350F 45 min to 1 hour, until
juices clear. 5- To crisp chicken, cook the last 15 min under the
broiler. 6- Prepare rice with parsley; serve chicken over rice. 7- My
preference is to bake chicken about 30 min and finish over a med-high
grill, basting with some of the sauce and saving some to pour over
chicken and rice at serving. Good Appetite, BoB FROM: BOB STAATS
