Recipe by: ianst@qdpii.ind.dpi.qld.gov.au (Ian Staples) Another recipe
courtesy of John Morris, butcher and caterer in Rockhampton,
Queensland, Australia, as discussed on ABC [Australian Broadcasting
Corp.] Radio on Sunday 13 March 1994 in the "Queensland Sunday"
programme.

John opened the discussion by stating that this is NOT a Lenten meal
;-) (He recommended it for breakfast in bed on Sunday mornings in
fact.)

Allow 6 or 7 spears per person.  Not too thin and not too old.

Trim bottom 1" of the asparagus spears and peel the lower part if
necessary (shouldn't be required if you've selected the bunches
correctly and trimmed off the bottoms) then poach them gently - get
about 1" of water boiling in

Cut the oysters into thin strips rather than serving them as lumps.

Reserve the juice from the oyster shells - should get about 2
tablespoon fr Mix this with the dry white wine and reduce over heat
by about 2/3rds (i.e. you'll have about 1 1/2 tablespoon left).

Add this liquor and about 4 tablespoon of the poaching water slowly
to the and whisk them over very low heat until light and frothy
(note: do not have the liquor or the other fluid too hot when adding
to the eggs - you don't want to curdle them).

Add seasoning.  Then draw the sauce together by adding 20 gram of
*cold* di butter and stirring it in gently. Add the oyster strips and
fold through.

Lay the freshly cooked asparagus spears on the serving plates and
pour the oyster sauce over them (fairly now ;-).
