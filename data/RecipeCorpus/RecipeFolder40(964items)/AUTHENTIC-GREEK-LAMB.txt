Title: AUTHENTIC GREEK LAMB
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-====================
Ingredients:

Leg of lamb many cloves of garlic lots of oregano and pepper lots of
lemon juice a bit of salt Place many cloves of garlic under the
skin/into the meat all around the leg.  Sprinkle lots of oregano,
pepper, lots of lemon juice, and a bit of salt on to the meat. Cover
with aluminum foil & bake. The meat should still be brown/pink when
done (Approx 1.5 hrs). I like to uncover the last 1/2 hour to get a
crust on the leg. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40
