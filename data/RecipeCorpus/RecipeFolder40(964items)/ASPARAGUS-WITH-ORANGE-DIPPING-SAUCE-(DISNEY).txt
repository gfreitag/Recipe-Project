Title: ASPARAGUS WITH ORANGE DIPPING SAUCE (DISNEY)
Categories: Vegetable
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Asparagus
1/2 ts Salt
SAUCE:
2 tb Orange juice
1 ts Orange rind -- finely
Grated
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 ts Sesame oil
Salt and pepper -- to taste
Find a saucepan that's wide enough to hold the asparagus spears
lengthwise and set it over medium-high heat. Fill about three
quarters with water, add the salt and bring to a boil. Plunge the
spears into the boiling water, return to a boil and cook until the
spears are just tender when pierced with a fork, about 2 to minutes
depending on their thicknes (do not overcook). Rinse under cold
running water to stop the cooking, then drain on a clean kitchen
towel. To prepare the sauce, whisk together the orange juice, orange
rind, olive oil sesame oil, and coarse salt and pepper until well
blended. Arrange the asparagus on a large serving platter with
dipping sauce on the side. Serve warm or cold.
