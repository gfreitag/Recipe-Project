Categories: Malaysia, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 4 Servings
3 c  Cooked rice
1    Chicken (3 pounds)
1    Onion
3 tb Sesame oil
2 tb Light soy sauce
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
Spread cooked rice in a pie pan.  Chop chicken into large pieces. Cut
onion into wedges.  In a wok or large pan heat sesame oil and brown
the chicken with the onions until the onions are transparent. Add soy
sauce and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Put the chicken on the
cooked rice in the pie plate.  Steam for about 30 minutes or until
the chicken is done. Serve warm.

If you have a rice cooker, you can just put the braised onions and
chicken on top of the raw rice and cook it that way.
