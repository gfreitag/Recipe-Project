Categories: Breads
Yield: 8 Scones

1/3 c  Sugar
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Dried apricots, diced (4oz)

In a food processor or large bowl, whirl or mix together flour, sugar,
baking powder, soda, and salt. Add butter; whirl or rub with fingers
until coarse crumbs form. If using a food processor, add apricots,
ginger, and peel; pulse until just blended. Otherwise, stir them into
flour mixture. Add buttermilk and whirl or stir just until evenly
moistened.

Scrape dough onto a floured board and knead about 6 turns or until
dough holds together. On a 12x15 inch lightly greased baking sheet,
pat dough into an oval about 7x12 inches. With a floured knife, cut
diagonal lines through dough, forming 8 or 9 triangles.

Bake in a 400 degree oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Break
along scores to serve. Makes 8 or 9.
