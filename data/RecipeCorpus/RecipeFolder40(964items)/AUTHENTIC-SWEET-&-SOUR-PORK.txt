CUT THE PORK INTO 1-INCH cubes. Put the cubes into a bowl together
with the rice wine or sherry, 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce and 1/2
teaspoon salt, and marinate for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the green
and red peppers into 1-inch squares. Peel and cut the carrot and
scallions into 1-inch chunks. Bring a pot of water to a boil and
blanch the carrots in it for 4 minutes; drain and set aside. Mix the
egg and cornstarch in a bowl until they are well blended into a
batter. Lift the pork cubes out of the marinade, put them into the
batter and coat each piece well. Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer or
large wok until it is almost smoking. Remove the pork pieces from the
batter with a slotted spoon, and deep-fry them. Drain the deep-fried
pork cubes on paper towels. Combine the chicken stock, soy sauce,
salt, vinegar, sugar and tomato paste in a large saucepan. Bring it
to a boil. Add vegetables (not the leches or oranges.) Stir well. In
a small bowl, blend together the cornstarch and water. Stir this
mixture into the sauce and bring it back to a boil. Turn the heat
down to a simmer. Add the leches or oranges and pork cubes. Mix well,
and then turn the mixture onto a deep platter. Serve at once.
