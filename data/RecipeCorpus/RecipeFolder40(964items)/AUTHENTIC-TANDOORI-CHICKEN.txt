Categories: Chicken
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Text recipe
Make a marinade of yoghurt, lime juice, chilli powder or paprika, five
spice powder (we would used "garam masala" which is a powder of
cloves, cinnamon, bay leaf, cardamom, nutmeg and pepper corns) paste
of green chillis, ginger-garlic paste, a pinch of red food colouring
and salt. Marinate it for at least three to four hours (leaving it
overnight would be best). Then heat your oven, pop the chicken pieces
in an oven-proof dish, pour in a little of the marinade and for the
effect of the "tandoor" place a piece of live-coal in your oven (it
gives a wonderful aroma). It takes around 10-15 minutes to get done
but around half way open the oven and brush the chicken with oil.
Make sure not to overdo it. It should be just done for the chicken to
be nice and succulent. When it is nice and dry serve it on a bed of
lettuce with lemon wedges (which could also be squeesed on the
chicken before serving) and a sprig of parsley.

Tandoori is a style of cooking which is close to grilling. In olden
times it used to be done in big clay pots which used to be put under
the ground for the meat to cook..but now we have "tandoors" or ovens
could be used too.
