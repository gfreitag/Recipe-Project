Title: APRICOT-GLAZED CORNISH HENS
Categories: Cornish hen
Yield: 8 Servings
3/4 c  Apricot preserves
Orange zest; grated
Juice of one orange
4    Cornish game hens
1/2 ts Paprika
1/2 c  Cashew nuts
2 tb Butter; melted
1/2 c  Scallions; sliced
6 oz Wild rice mix
2 1/3 c  Chicken broth
Spinach leaves
Apricot roses *
Combine apricot preserves, orange rind, and orange juice; set aside.
Remove giblets from hens; reserve for other uses. Rinse hens with
cold water, and pat dry. Close cavities, and secure with wooden
picks; truss. Sprinkle with paprika and place on a rack in a lightly
greased roasting pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours,
basting frequently with about 1/2 cup apricot mixture during the last
30 minutes.

Saute cashews in butter in a large skillet until cashews are golden.
Drain and set aside, reserving butter in skillet. Saute onions in
same skillet until tender. Add wild rice, and prepare according to
package directions, substituting chicken broth for water and omitting
salt. When done, stir the cashews back into the rice. Arrange Cornish
hens on serving platter; brush with remaining apricot mixture.
Garnish with apricot roses and spinach leaves, if desired, and serve
with rice.

* To make apricot roses, use a rolling pin to flatten 4 or 5 dried
apricots for each rose. Wrap apricots around each other, shaping them
to resemble a rose; pinch stem end to make them adhere.
