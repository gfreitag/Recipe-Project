9 oz Water
2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/4 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
3 oz Finely shredded Asiago
Cheese (1 cup
Lightly packed)
1 oz Shredded Romano or Parmesan
(generous 1/3
Cup)
1/2 tb Caraway seeds (optional)
1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
2 3/4 c  Bread flour or unbleached
Flour
2 ts Active dry yeast
Place all ingredients in pan of bread machine in order listed, or in
the order recommended for your machine. (I usually toss the grated
cheese with the cornmeal before adding it to the pan, to decrease
clumping.) Set controls for Basic bread with medium crust and start
machine. Makes one 1.5-pound loaf.
