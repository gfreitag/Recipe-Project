Preparation:  Peel turnips & carrots. Use melon scoop to cut turnips
into large balls.  Slice carrots 1/2" thick; then with paring knife,
cut 4 evenly spaced notches into rim of each slice (don't cut into
center core). Carrots should look like little flowers. Parboil turnip
& carrots in stock until barely tender. Remove from stock & plunge
pieces into cold water; drain. Cut onions, asparagus & baby corn into
1 1/2" pieces. Mince together fresh ginger root & Tientsin preserved
vegetable. Insmall pot or beaker on medium heat, render pieces of
chicken fat.

Stir-frying:  Add peanut oil to hot wok.   When it begins to smoke,
briskly fry crab meat or shrimp for 1 minute. Add asparagus, baby
corn, mushrooms & water chestnuts, stir-frying until they are hot.
Add ginger mixture, then onions.  Stir-fry another 30 seconds. Add
1/2 stock, salt & sugar; bring to boil. Add turnips & carrots. Cover
& reduce heat; simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover, push ingredients out of
liquid, & dribble in cornstarch paste to thicken slightly.  Stir
liquid to prevent lumping while it thickens to a thick soup.
Recombine, then mix in chicken oil. Remove to serving platter.
