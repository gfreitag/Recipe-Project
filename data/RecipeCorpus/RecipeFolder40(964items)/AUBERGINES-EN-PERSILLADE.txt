This is a simple, rather classic way of sauteeing aubergines with
garlic, parsley, spring onions and breadcrumbs. Its mouth-watering
flavours and irresistible textures make a lovely supper dish, served
with a tomato salad and hot, soft rolls.

Cut the aubergines into large cubes. Saute in hot olive oil, shaking
the pan frequently until browned all over on the outside and tender
inside. Dry on kitchen paper and keep warm.

Fry the breadcrumbs in more oil until golden all over, add the spring
onions, garlic and herbs and then return the aubergines to the pan.
Toss over a moderately high heat until the aubergines are sizzling,
add salt to taste, then toss in the parsley and serve in a hot dish.
