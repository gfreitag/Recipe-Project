Title: ARROZ DE POLVO (OCTOPUS RICE)
Categories: Seafood, Portuguese
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Octopus
1 c  Red wine
3/4 c  Olive oil
1    Onion; chopped
2    Garlic clove; finely chopped
3    Tomato; skinned & chopped
1 lg Bell pepper, green; chopped
Salt; to taste
Pepper; to taste
Chilli powder; to taste
1 lb Rice, short grain
Precook octopus in red wine with a little water. The octopus will
exude liquid so that you are likely to end up with more cooking
liquid at the end. Retain this and add water to make it up to 2-1/2
cups. Cut the drained octopus into small pieces.

Heat olive oil in a large saucepan; add a chopped onion and cook
gently, stirring, for 2 or 3 minutes. Add garlic, tomatoes, and
pepper. Season with salt, pepper and chilli powder to taste. Cook for
a few minutes longer.

Add the cooking liquid from the octopus and bring it to the boil. Add
rice (preferably a short-grain risotto rice like arborio) and bring
back to the boil, then turn the heat very low and put the lid on the
saucepan. After 15 minutes, stir to ensure the rice is not catching
on the bottom of the saucepan. In 5 minutes more, taste a grain or
two to make sure it is soft. The rice should still be quite damp.

Serve.
