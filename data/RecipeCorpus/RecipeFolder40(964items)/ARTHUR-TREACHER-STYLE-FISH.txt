2 tb Lemon juice
1 c  Milk -- or more as needed
2 c  Flour
3 c  Pancake mix
2 c  Club Soda (approx.)
1 ts Basil
1 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Garlic salt
Cooking oil
Cut fish fillets in half, making triangular shape. Cover with milk and
lemon juice and refrigerate 3-4 hours. Drain off milk. Dip fillets in
flour to coat each piece lightly. Letdry on a cookie sheet, making
sure pieces do not tough. Add oil to deep fryer or heavy pan to a
depth of at least 3 inches. Heat oil to 425~. Combine pancake mix,
basil, pepper, garlic salt and enough soda to make a thick batter,
about the consistency of buttermilk. Dip floured fillets in batter
and add to the hot oil one at a time. Fry 4-5 minutes. Remove filets
to cookie sheet, again, not letting them touch and keep warm in a
250~ oven. Deep fry remaining filets, keeping the depth of the oil at
least 3 inches. NOTE: Do notheap fish as this creates steam in the
oven and makes coating soft.
