This recipe for "Auntie Ruth's Wash Day beans***(NJMH36B) should
appeal to many on the Forum and is a very flexible recipe. By trial &
error you can fix the amounts of each ingredient to suit your own
taste. Wash dried beans (my family likes baby limas or navy) Cook
according to package directions.
Then add: Simmer all day, adjusting ingredients to taste. Serve with
chopped onions and corn bread for toppings. Nothing fancy-just Midwest
good! FROM: ALICE JOHNSON (NJMH36B)
