Title: ARTICHOKES & PEAS
Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lg Artichokes
1    Lemon (juice only)
2 tb Virgin olive oil
lg Basil leaves;
- sliced in strips
1 lg Onion, white or yellow
- sliced 1/4-in thick
Salt
1 lb Fresh pod peas; -=OR=-
1 c  Frozen peas
Finely chopped parsley
Freshly milled pepper
1 tb Sweet butter
-=OR=-Extra-Virgin Olive Oil
Lemon juice; to taste
-=OR=- Champagne Vinegar
SLICE THE UPPER 2/3 of the leaves off the artichokes, then break off
the remaining leaves, snapping them off at the base. Trim off the
dark green stubs, going around the artichoke with a paring knife. Cut
them in quarters, remove the fuzzy choke and slice each quarter into
pieces 1/4-to-1/2-inch thick. As you work, rub the cut surfaces with
lemon and put them in a bowl with the lemon juice and water to cover.
Gently warm the olive oil with half the basil. When it is fairly hot,
but not sizzling, add the onions and the sliced artichokes. Salt
lightly and give them a stir to coat them with the oil, then add 3/4
cup water and cook over a medium-low flame. As the water cooks off,
add more, in 1/2-cup increments until the artichokes are cooked,
about 25 minutes. Add the peas and continue cooking until they are
done. Let any liquids reduce until they are syrupy. Taste and season
with salt. Add the rest of the basil, the parsley and the butter or
olive oil. To brighten the flavors, stir in a little lemon juice or
champagne vinegar to taste.
