Title: AUNT ANN'S CELERY SEED DRESSING
Categories: Salads
Yield: 3 Cups
1 1/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Dry mustard
2 ts Salt
1 sm Onion, chopped fine
2 c  Oil
1 c  Vinegar
2 ts Celery seed
1    Garlic clove
Mix all ingredients together. I use my blender then I don't have to
chop the onions. This will keep several weeks in a jar with a plastic
lid. Do not use a metal lid, since the vinegar will rust the lid.

You can adjust the sugar and salt to suit your own taste. We find
that 1 1/4 c sugar is too much, and so is 2 t of salt.

The dressing is especially good on a fresh fruit or spinach salad.

This recipe comes from my Husband's Aunt, Ann Mitchell.
