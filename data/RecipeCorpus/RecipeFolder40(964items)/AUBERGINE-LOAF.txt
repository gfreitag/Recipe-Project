Most vegetable 'loaves' take an eternity to make, but this one is the
exception. Everything goes into the blender, and it is made in next
to no time. The result is outstandingly good, a loaf that is
delicious hot, warm or cold. You can also make it using mushrooms
instead of the aubergines, and the result is also memorable.

Cut the aubergine into pieces and mince in the blender. Put into a
bowl. Whizz all the rest of the ingredients in the blender and fold
in the minced aubergine. Bake in a greased loaf tin (500 g or 1 lb)
at 200 degrees C / 400 degrees F / gas 6 for 20 minutes, then at 180
degrees C / 350 degrees F / gas 4 for a further 15 minutes or until a
knife comes out clean from the centre. Cover with a cloth for 10
minutes, then turn out of the tin.
