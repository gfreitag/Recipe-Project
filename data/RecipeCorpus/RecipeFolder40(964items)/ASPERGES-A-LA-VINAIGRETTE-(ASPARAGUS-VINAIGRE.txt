Place asparagus on a platter and let cool to room temperature.

Pass the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper around the table. Pour some oil
(about 2 T) and some vinegar (about 1 t) onto each plate. (Place a
fork underneath the top of your plate, tilting the plate gently
toward you, and pour the vinaigrette into the bottom of each plate.)
Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Serve the asparagus.  Pick up a piece of asparagus from the platter
with your hands and stir the vinaigrette with it a little before
popping the tip in your mouth. Continue stirring and eating until you
get to the tougher bottom part of the stem.  Start over with a new
piece, adding more oil and vinegar as needed. Pass finger bowls or
damp towels after this entree!
