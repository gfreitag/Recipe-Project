Title: ATHOL BROSE
Categories: Beverages, Holidays, Gifts
Yield: 3 Pints
1 1/2 ts Unflavored gelatin
1/3 c  Cold water
1 c  Honey

This brew originated in Athol, Scotland (a district famouse for its
deer hunting).  Early versions included water in which oatmeal had
been soaked overnight.  Here gelating provides for the thickening.

IN a small saucepan, sprinkle the gelatin over water and let soften
for several minutes.  Place over low heat and cook, stirring
occasionally,until gelatin dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in cream
and heat until mixture is quite warm (about 110F), 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove form heat and stir in whisky.

Serve warm or chilled.  Store brose in a sterilized bottle in the
refrigerator, where it will keep for a month or more. If giving as a
gift, place in an old fashioned bottle, and wrap in bright colored
gift napkin or piece of fabric.
