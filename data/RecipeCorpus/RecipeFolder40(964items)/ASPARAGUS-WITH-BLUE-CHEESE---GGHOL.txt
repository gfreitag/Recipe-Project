Title: ASPARAGUS WITH BLUE CHEESE - GGHOL
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Asparagus; cleaned
2 ts Red wine vinegar
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Chives; minced
4 tb Blue cheese; crumbled
White pepper; freshly ground
Snap ends off asparagus spears.  Fill medium skillet with 1-inch
water and bring to a boil.  Add asparagus in single layer and cook 8
to 10 minutes or until tender. Drain well and arrange on a serving
plate. Stir together vinegar and oil in sm bowl.  Add blue cheese and
chives and mix well. Pour over hot asparagus. Season to taste with
plenty of white pepper. Set aside until tepid, then serve.

Hint on cleaning asparagus:  Hold the bottom end of the stem in one
hand and gently bend the stalk with the other. The stalk will break
where it is tender, thus giving you a piece of asparagus that is
entirely edible. With a little practice you will know exactly where
to break the vegetable. Save the broken-off ends for soups. Slice and
add to soup stock, then drain and discard the coarse stalks before
serving.
