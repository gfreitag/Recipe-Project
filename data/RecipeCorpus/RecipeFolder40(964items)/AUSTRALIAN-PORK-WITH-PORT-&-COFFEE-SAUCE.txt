Title: AUSTRALIAN PORK WITH PORT & COFFEE SAUCE
Categories: Pork, Australian
Yield: 8 Servings
4 1/2 lb Pork loin, boneless
1 c  Coffee, strong
1/2 c  Cream
1/3 c  Port
2 ts Sugar
1/4 c  ;Water
2 ts Cornstarch
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Remove rind from pork and trim fat to make a 1/2 inch layer (or
less). Roll and tie the meat. Weigh pork and calculate total cooking
time, (allow 25-30 minutes per pound). Place meat in roasting pan.
Roast pork for 30 minutes.

Combine coffee, 1/4 cup cream, 1/4 cup port & sugar, pour over pork.
Continue roasting pork for calculated cooking time, basting pork
every 15 mins with coffee mixture.

This basting gives the outside a beautiful golden glaze & helps to
keep the meat moist.

Remove pork from oven when cooked. Keep covered in a warm place while
making the sauce.

Skim fat from the pan juices. Place juices in a small saucepan with
water, remaining cream, remaining port and cornstarch. Cook until
thickened, then strain.

Slice pork thinly and place a tablespoon or two of sauce on each
serving. Remaining sauce should be available for guests to add more.
