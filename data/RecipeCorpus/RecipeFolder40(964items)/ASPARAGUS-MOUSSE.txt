Title: ASPARAGUS MOUSSE
Categories: Vegetables, Salads
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Asparagus
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
4 ts Lemon juice
1 tb Green onion, chopped
2    Envelopes unflavored gelatin
1/2 c  Water
1 c  Whipping cream
2    Egg whites
1 ts Salt
Break off tough stems from asparagus and discard. Peel lower half of
asparagus stems; cut into 1-inch lengths. In saucepan of boiling
salted water, cook asparagus for about 10-minutes or until tender;
drain. In food processor or blender, process until smooth. There
should be about 2 cups puree.  Transfer to saucepan. Add mayonnaise,
lemon juice and onion; cook over low heat just until warmed through.

Meanwhile, in small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over water; let stand
for 5 minutes to soften.

Over low heat, warm gelatin until disolved; stir into asparagus
mixture. Transfer to bowl and place in large bowl of ice and water to
chill, stirring frequently, for 10 to 15 minutes or until cold and
slightly thickened.  Remove from iced water.

Whip cream; set aside.  In large bowl, beat egg whites with salt until
stiff peaks form.  Whisk about one-quarter of the beaten egg whites
into cooled asparagus mixture; fold into remaining whites along with
whipped cream.  Pour into rinsed 6-cup mould. Cover and refrigerate
for at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.

To unmould, wrap hot damp tea towel around mould for 1 minute. Using
knife, loosen top edge of mousse from mould. Tilt or gently shake
mould to loosen mousse. Invert rinsed serving platter on top of
mould. Grasp platter and mould; quickly turn over.  Shake using quick
downward motion, to release mousse from mould. Lift off mould. (If
mousse sticks, repeat the procedure.)
