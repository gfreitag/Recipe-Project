Categories: Fruits, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/2 lb Asparagus
2 c  Hulled strawberries
1/4 c  Strawberry vinegar
MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
1 tb Walnut oil
1/2 c  Peanut oil
1 1/2 ts Honey
Trim asparagus and cut each stalk in thirds.  Steam until tender but
still crisp.  (Thin young stalks took 5 minutes.) Plunge in ice
water; drain.

Wash strawberries, then hull.  Cut strawberries in half; combine with
asparagus.

Combine dressing ingredients; toss asparagus and strawberries gently
with dressing. Chill well before serving.

The authors write: "What could be simpler - or more delicious - than
spring's first asparagus combined with spring's first strawberries?"

My notes: Good, and simple.
