Title: APPLESAUCE CAKE BAKED IN A JAR
Categories: Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
2/3 c  Shortening
2 2/3 c  Sugar
4    Eggs
2 c  Applesauce
2/3 c  Water
3 1/3 c  All-purpose flo sifted
1/2 ts Baking powder
2 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Cinnamon
2 ts Ground cloves
2/3 c  Nuts, chopped (optional)
Preheat oven to 325-degrees.

Sterilize 5 straight-sided Ball Quilted Crystal (#14400- 81400)
canning jars, lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes. Keep the
lids and rings in the water until you're ready to use them. Remove
the jars from the water and place them on a clean dish towel to
air-dry (up, not upside down). When the jars are cool enough to
handle, grease the insides with shortening (DO NOT use butter,
margarine, PAM or Baker's Secret); set aside.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon
and cloves; set aside.

Cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a
time until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the applesauce and
water. Blend the dry ingredients into the applesauce mixture. Fold in
the nuts.; set aside. Fill well greased jars half full. Place the
jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll tip over.

Bake for 35 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. like you
would any canned goods.

The method for making the cakes is the same -- no matter which
recipe you use. The only difference will be the ingredients (of
course), the amount of jars needed and the baking times- -that's all,
everything else is the same. Don't limit yourself to the recipes I'm
giving you -- use your favorite quick-bread recipe. I plan on trying
the Carrot Cake recipe I posted.
