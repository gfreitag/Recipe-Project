Categories: New, Text, Import
4 lg artichokes
Salt and pepper
Yield: 4 Servings
:
1/2 c  virgin olive oil
2    lemons -- cut in wedges

Pull off outer layers of deep green leaves from each artichoke and
discard. Cut off stem and set aside. Rub each cut with a lemon wedge.
Place artichoke on its side and cut off top third. Discard these
points. Using a pair of scissors, cut offthe sharp points. Soak 10
minutes in cold water with 1 ounce. lemon juice.

Carefully open the leaves by prying with your fingers as if opening a
flower and the pressing down on the counter the opening face. Drain
each artichoke on paper towels, shaking to remove all liquid. Season
aggressively with salt and pepper between each leaf and all over.

Heat the virgin olive oil in a tall side sauce pan, 8-inch to 10-inch
wide at base until just smoking.

Cook artichokes in this hot oil 12 to 15 minutes, until golden all
over. After 10 minutes of cooking, spritz the pan by shaking your wet
hand over the artichokes to mist them. Be careful: this will cause
the oil to sizzle and spatter..

When the artichokes are cooked, remove each one, and holding the
artichoke by skewering its base with a fork, press the flower side
down to force it further open. Drain on paper towels, season with
salt and pepper again and serve with lemon wedges.
