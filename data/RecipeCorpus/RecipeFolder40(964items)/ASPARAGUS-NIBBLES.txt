Title: ASPARAGUS NIBBLES
Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
25    Asparagus spears -- fresh
Salt to taste
25 sl Bread
White or whole wheat
8 oz Cream cheese -- softened
3 oz Bleu cheese -- softened
1    Egg
Melted butter - 1 to 1 1/2

These wonderful little make-ahead hors d'oeuvres are a treat to
assemble in the spring when asparagus hits the market. You can store
them in your freezer for a time later in the year when the taste
would really hit the spot.

Blanch asparagus spears until barely tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain
immediately and plunge into cold water to stop the cooking process.
Remove crusts from bread and flatten slices with a rolling pin. In a
medium bowl, combine cheeses and egg, blending with an electric
beater. Spread mixture evenly over bread slices. Trim asparagus
spears to same length as bread slices, and then place one spear on
each slice and roll up, jelly roll fashion. Dip each roll in melted
butter to coat all sides, and place on a cookie sheet. Freeze rolls
until hard, then re-package in freezer-storage containers. When ready
to bake, cut frozen rolls into thirds and bake (while still frozen)
in 400 degree oven for 15 minutes or until lightly browned.  Serve
immediately. Yields 75 pieces. (YES: 75) Source: Sandwich Cuisine, by
