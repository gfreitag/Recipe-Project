Title: AUSTRALIAN STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Dates (180g) --  pitted and
Chopped
1 ts Bicarbonate of soda
1 c  Boiling water
2 tb Butter
1 c  Soft brown sugar
2    Eggs
1 1/2 c  Self-raising flour-sifted
Toffee Sauce:
1 c  Soft brown sugar
3/4 c  Light whipping cream.
1/2 ts Vanilla
2 tb Butter
Mix dates and baking soda in a heat-proof bowl. Pour boiling water on
top and leave to stand. Cream butter and sugar until pale, then add
eggs one at a time, heating well after each addition. Gently fold in
sifted flour, stir in the date mixture, and pour into a lightly
buttered 18cm or 7" square or round cake tin. Bake in a preheated
oven (180 C) for 30-40 minutes, until an inserted skewer comes clean.
Combine sugar, cream, vanilla essence and butter in a saucepan, bring
to the boil, stirring, and simmer for five minutes. Set aside until
ready to serve, then quickly reheat when needed. Cut pudding into
squares and place each square in the centre of a warm dinner plate.
Pour hot toffee sauce over each square and serve with fresh cream.
