Title: AUTUMN PEAR SALSA
Categories: Sauces

When looking for grapefruits, try to find the sweet pink ones, as they
complement the pears best.  Serve as a condiment as you would
cranberry sauce with turkey.

1. Peel the grapefruit, removing all white pith. Carefully section the
fruit, then cut each section crosswise into thirds. Place in a bowl
with any accumulated juices.

2. Peel and core the pears, then cut into 1/4" dice. Add at once to
the grapefruit to prevent discoloration.

3. Toss with the remaining ingredients.
