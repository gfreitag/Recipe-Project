Title: ARIZONA PECAN CHOCOLATE RUM PIE
Categories: Pies, Desserts
Yield: 1 Pie
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/4 c  Flour
1/2 c  Lard; chilled
3    Eggs; lightly beaten
3 tb Water
1/4 ts Vinegar
1 1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
3 tb Butter
3/4 c  Dark corn syrup
1/2 c  Brown sugar
3/4 ts Vanilla extract
1 tb Rum
1 1/4 c  Chopped pecans
Mix the salt into the flour and cut in the lard. Measure out 1
tablespoon of the beaten eggs into a small bowl and reserve the
remaining eggs. Add the water and vinegar to the bowl and stir.
Slowly add the liquid to the flour and lard, just until the mixture
holds together to form a dough. Lightly flour a work surface and
rolling pin and roll the dough into an 11-inch circle.  Fit it into a
9-inch pie pan and refrigerate it if you plan to finish the pie after
several hours, or freeze it if you are completing the recipe at this
point. This will prevent shrinkage. Melt the chocolate and butter
together in a heavy saucepan. Set aside and allow to cool. Stir the
corn syrup and sugar into the reserved eggs. Add the chocolate and
butter, vanilla, rum and the pecans. Mix well and pour into the pie
shell. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, or until set. The
filling will rise and then fall. Remove from the oven and cool on a
rack. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.
