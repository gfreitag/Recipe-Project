Title: AVOCADO WITH MUSHROOM FILLING (VEGAN)
Categories: Appetizers, Spreads
Yield: 2 Servings
175 g  Button mushrooms
-- minced in the blender
3 tb Pesto sauce
1 lg Ripe avocado
-- cut in half and stoned
Lettuce leaves to garnish
Mincing fresh raw mushrooms in the blender takes a few seconds only,
and gives a better texture for this dish than chopping them by hand.
Mixed with pesto sauce and heaped into the cavity of a ripe avocado,
this makes a delectable starter.

Steam the minced mushrooms for 3 minutes. Cool, and drain off the
juices. Mix the mushrooms with the pesto and place inside the hollow
of the avocado halves. Place on a bed of lightly dressed lettuce
leaves to serve (see Dressings).
