Title: ARNI SOUVLAKI

NANCY BERRY
1    Leg lamb;about 4 lb. --
Boned
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Dry white wine

3    Bay leaves -- broken in

Black pepper to taste
(CWBJ78A)
Cut lamb into 1 1/2 inch cubes and place in a non-reactive (glass or
earthenware) dish. Add remaining ingredients to lamb, mix well to coat
meat, and cover. You can also place all ingredients in a heavy
plastic bag and seal. Leave in refrigerator to marinate for 12-24
hours, stirring meat occasionally. Lift lamb out of marinade and
thread onto metal skewers. Pieces of bay leaf may be placed between
lamb cubes. Since most vegetables have different cooking times, I
would suggest that you skewer peppers, onions, etc. separately and
serve them together with the lamb. If you wish these may be marinated
also (in a separate bag.) Cook under a hot broiler or over glowing
charcoal, turning and basting frequently with marinade. I like this
best medium rare. Keep checking the meat -- the cooking time will
vary because charcoal fires are so variable. Place on a platter and
garnish with parsley and lemon wedges. Serves 6-8.
