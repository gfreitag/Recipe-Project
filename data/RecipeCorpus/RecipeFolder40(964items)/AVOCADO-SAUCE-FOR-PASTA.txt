Title: AVOCADO SAUCE FOR PASTA
Categories: Pasta, Sauces and
Yield: 1 Servings
1 oz Butter
2    To 3 Spring Onions,Green And
-White Parts, Chop -- * see
-note
1 ts Grated Orange Peel
1 ts Grated Lemon Peel
1/2 ts Ground Coriander -- ** see
Note
6 fl Oz Single (Light) Cream
3 tb Plain Yoghurt
Salt And Freshly Ground
Black Pepper -- to taste
2    To 3 Avocados
* shallots work just as well, although you need more ** we really like
coriander, so we put in a couple of teaspoons

Melt butter in a saucepan, add spring onions and stir-fry 1 minute.
Then add orange and lemon peel and coriander. Remove from the heat
while you prepare cream and yoghurt. Pour cream into a small bowl and
add yoghurt, salt and pepper. Mix well until smooth. Peel, stone and
chop avocados (the size you chop the pieces is personal preference,
but we usually chop into about 1.5 cm cubes).  Add the avocado to the
ingredients in the pan, pour yoghurt mixture over and very gently
heat through. DO NOT BOIL or avocados will become soggy and sauce
will curdle.  Pour over pasta, toss and serve at once.

Note:  This sauce can be started in advance but the avocados should
not be added until the last minute.

For the two of us for dinner, we halve all of the ingredients, and
use one medium to large sized avocado.
