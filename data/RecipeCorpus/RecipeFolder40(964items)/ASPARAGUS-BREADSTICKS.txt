Title: ASPARAGUS BREADSTICKS
Categories: Breads, Appetizers
Yield: 18 Servings
2    Bread dough loaves*
1    Large egg white
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1 ts Dried tarragon leaves
1 ts Dried dill weed
* - frozen white or whole wheat, thawed

Set loaves on a floured board and pat each loaf into a 5x10"
rectangle. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rinse until puffy,
45 minutes to 1 hour.

Cut each loaf crosswise into 9 equal pieces. Pick up the ends of each
piece, and stretch it to the length of a 12x15" greased baking sheet
and set on pan; if dough snaps back, let rest a few minutes, then
stretch again. Repeat to make each stick, spacing about 1 1/2" apart.

With scissors at a 45' angle, snip dough to make cuts about 1/2" apart
along about 4" of 1 end of each stick.

Beat egg white until slightly frothy; brush dough lightly with egg
white. Mix cheese, tarragon, and dill. Sprinkle evenly over dough.

Bake in a 350' oven until breadsticks are browned, 20-25 minutes. (If
using 1 oven, switch pan positions halfway through baking; chill
remaining pans of dough until oven is free.) Transfer breadsticks to
racks.

Serve warm or cool. If you make sticks ahead, let cool, package
airtight, and hold up to 4 hours, or freeze. To recrisp, bake
breadsticks (thawed, if frozen), uncovered, on pans in a 350' oven
until warm, about 5 minutes.
