tablespoon oil over medium heat for 10 minutes and add to the chicken.

STEP #3 - Add lime juice and the artichoke hearts to the chicken.
Cover and simmer for 40 to 55 minutes over low heat.

khoresh and adjust seasoning. Transfer it to a deep casserole. Cover
and place in a warm oven until ready to serve.

STEP #5 - Serve hot from the same dish with steamed basmati; cook it
very slowly with a very tight fitting lid. Add salt to water to help
rice withstand a longer cooking time.

Nush-e jan! (Enjoy this food of life.)

VARIATIONS:  For *ab ghureh* substitute 3/4 cup unripe grape juice
for the lime juice. Frozen (2 9-oz pkgs) or bottled artichokes may be
substituted. Drain well. If pre-cooked, adjust cooking time, adding
artichoke hearts when appropriate to step 3. Chicken can be replaced
with 1 pound lean stew meat such as lamb, veal or beef, cut into 1
inch cubes. In step 1, increase water to 2-1/2 cups; and simmer for
55 minutes insteadof 30 minutes.
