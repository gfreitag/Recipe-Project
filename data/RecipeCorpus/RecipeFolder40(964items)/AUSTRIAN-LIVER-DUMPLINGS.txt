1>. Cut liver into chunks and place into blender until all meat has
been pureed. Soak the roll or bread in water until soft, squeeze out
the surplus moisture and finely mince or grate. Cream the butter with
the other ingredients, finally adding sufficient breadcrumbs to make

soup, simmer in this for 5 minutes. They may also be cooked in stock
and served with meat and gravy.
