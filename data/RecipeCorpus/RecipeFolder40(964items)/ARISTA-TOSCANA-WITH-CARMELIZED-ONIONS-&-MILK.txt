3 lg Spanish onions, -- peeled
3 lb Pork loin, -- with bone
2 c  Whole milk

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Smash garlic cloves to paste and place in roasting pan large enough

bottom of the pan over the garlic. Season the pork roast all over

Remove pan from oven and remove the pork roast to a warm platter.
Place half of the cooked onions and all the drippings into a blender
and blend about 30 seconds or until smooth and thick. Arrange the
other half of the onions in a pile on the serving platter and carve
pork off of bone. Slice meat into 1/2" thick slices and arrange over
onions. Pour sauce from blender over meat and serve immediately.
