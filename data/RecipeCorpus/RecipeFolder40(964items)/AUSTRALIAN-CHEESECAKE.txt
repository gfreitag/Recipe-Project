~----------------- NOTE:  Prebaked crusts are much crisper than the
chilled ones and this can be important if you want a crisp crust.
CRUST: If you are prebaking the shell, preheat the oven to 350
degrees F. Place the crumbs in a mixing bowl and add the butter and
sugar blending well. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and up
the sides of an 8-inch springform pan. Smooth the mixture to form an
even layer on the bottom and sides. Bake the crust in the oven for 10
minutes and let cool to room temperature before filling. NOTE: This
crust can be chilled for 5 to 10 minutes in the freezer until it is
set but is not recommended in this recipe. CHEESECAKE: Preheat the
oven to 300 degrees F.  In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese
and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks, one at a time,
beating well after each.  Beat in the flour, lemon rind, lemon juice,
and vanilla until just mixed.  Whip the cream until stiff in a medium
mixing bowl. Set aside. In another mixing bowl, beat the egg whites
until they form stiff peaks, then fold them into the cheese mixture.
Fold in the reserved whipped cream. Stir in the passion fruit pulp
then pour the mixture into the prepared crust and bake fro 45 minutes
to 1 hour.
Cool, in the oven, to room temperature, then chill.
