Title: ARTICHOKE & CRACKED WHEAT BREAD ABM
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Servings
MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
9 oz Marinated artichoke hearts
1/2 tb Yeast
1 1/2 c  Bread flour
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/3 c  Cracked wheat
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1/2 tb Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
3 tb Parmesan, grated
1 c  Water; warm
Drain artichoke hearts, reserving 3 tb liquid.

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Since the flavor of this loaf is not too assertive, but the texture is
substantial, it is a good sandwich bread for spicy meats, such as
salami or pate, and ripe cheese. For early in the day eating, toast
and spread with orange marmalade or apple butter.
