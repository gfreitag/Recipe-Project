Categories: Cookies
Yield: 2 Dozen
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
1/2 c  Sour cream
1/4 c  Unsalted butter, softened
1 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2/3 c  Apricot jam
2/3 c  Walnuts, chopped
2 tb Raisins
2 tb Golden raisins
Make the pastry:

1. With an electric mixer on medium speed, blend the sour crem and
butter until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the flour and salt and
blend until the dough comes together, about 30 seconds.

2. Form the dough into 2 disks, wrap in plastic and chill overnight.

3. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let soften slightly, for
about 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, with a rack in the
middle. Lightly grease a baking sheet.

4. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each disk to a circle about
9 to 10 inches in diameter and less than 1/8 inch thick.

Prepare the Filling:

5. Spread 1/3 cup apricot jam over the surface of 1 disk, leaving a
1/4 inch border around the edges. Sprinkle 1/3 cup of the walnuts, 1
tablespoon of the raisins and 1 tablespoon of the golden raisins over
the jam.

6. Roll up the dough jelly-roll fashion, pinching the ends together.
Carefully lift the roll with your hands and transfer to the baking
sheet. With a sharp knife, slice the roll halfway through into about
12    sections.

7. Repeat the procedure with the remaining dough and filling.

8. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on the
baking sheet for 5 minutes. Cut the slices through; cool completely
on the sheet. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week or
freeze for several months.
