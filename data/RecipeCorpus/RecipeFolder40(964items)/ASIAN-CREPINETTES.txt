Title: ASIAN CREPINETTES
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 8 Servings
1 lb Ground Lamb
4 tb Fresh Asian or reg. Basil
- (finely chopped)
3 tb Minced Fresh Coriander
1 tb Finely chopped Ginger
2 ts Finely chopped Garlic
1 ts Salt
2 ts Sichuan Peppercorns
- roasted and ground
2 ts Coarse. chopped dried chiles
1 tb Light soy sauce
1 tb Dark soy sauce
2 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
2 ts Chinese sesame oil
1/2 lb Caul fat or crepinette
This is an Asian twist on a French appetizer. Caul fat can be ordered
from your local butcher.

SOAK THE CAUL FAT in a bowl of cold water; this will allow the caul
fat to unravel easily. In a medium-sized bowl, mix the ground lamb
with all the ingredients except the caul fat. Cut the caul fat into
20 (5-inch) squares. Lay out a square of caul fat and place several
tablespoons of lamb mixture onto one end. Fold the sides in to form a
package. Repeat until you have used up all the lamb. Recipe can be
done ahead to this point and refrigerated. Wrap the crepinettes well
in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Approximately 40 minutes before you
are ready to cook, make a charcoal fire and, when the coals are ash
white, grill the crepinettes for about 8 minutes on each side, or
until they are done (firm to the touch). Makes 6 to 8 Servings
