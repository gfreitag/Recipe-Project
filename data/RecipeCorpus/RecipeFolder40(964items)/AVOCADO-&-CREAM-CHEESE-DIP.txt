The mouthwatering texture of this rich green dip is the perfect base
for its fresh, slightly garlicky flavour. A popular favourite for all
times of the year.

Scoop the flesh out of the avocado and blend it thoroughly in the
food-processor with the spinach. Add the mashed curd cheese and
liquidize again. Then mix in the garlic and lemon juice to taste, and
stir in the chopped spring onions. Season to taste with salt and
paprika. Chill for a while before serving.
