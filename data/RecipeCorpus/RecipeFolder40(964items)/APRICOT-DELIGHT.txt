Title: APRICOT DELIGHT
Categories: Fruits, Desserts
Yield: 2 Servings
50 g  Dried apricots
- preferably unsulphured
175 g  Greek yogurt
1    Egg white; stiffly beaten
Grated chocolate
-(to decorate)
This recipe is a long-established favourite and can be made at any
time of the year. If you make it with unsulphured dried apricots the
result will be noticeably more delicious.

Soak the apricots in water for just 1 hour, then chop them roughly.
They will be slightly crunchy. Fold them into the yogurt and mix
well. Fold the stiffly beaten egg white into the mixture and spoon
into two dishes. Sprinkle with grated chocolate. Serve as soon as
possible.
