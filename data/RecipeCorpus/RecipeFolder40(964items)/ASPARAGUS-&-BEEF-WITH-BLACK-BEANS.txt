COVER THE BLACK BEANS with warm water for 5 minutes. Drain. Rinse
thoroughly to remove salt. Put into a bowl with the garlic and
ginger; mash into a paste and set aside. Slice the beef against the
grain into 1/4-inch thick slices; toss with the beef marinade. Set
aside for 10 minutes. Preheat a wok until hot. Add 2 tablespoons of
the oil. Over high heat, add beef and stir-fry for a minute or until
seared; remove and set aside. While wok is hot, add remaining oil,
salt and reserved black-bean paste; stir-fry until fragrant, a few
seconds. Toss in the onions, stir-fry for 10 seconds, then add the
asparagus in 2-or-3 batches, seconds apart, making certain the wok is
hot before adding the next batch. Toss and stir until asparagus are
coated with the oil. Sprinkle with soy sauce, toss together, then
pour in the stock and bring to a boil. If the asparagus needs more
cooking, cover for a minute. Meanwhile, stir the cornstarch, water,
sugar and oyster sauce into a smooth paste. When the asparagus is
tender but still crisp, add the cornstarch liquid into the center of
the wok. Immediately stir until thickened, about 10 seconds. Return
the beef, add a desh of sesame oil; toss to mix. Serve hot over rice.
