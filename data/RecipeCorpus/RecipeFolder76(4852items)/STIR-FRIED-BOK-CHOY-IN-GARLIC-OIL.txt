Title: STIR-FRIED BOK CHOY IN GARLIC OIL
Categories: Oriental, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
3 tb Peanut oil
1 ts Salt
4    Garlic cloves
- lightly crushed & peeled
1 1/2 lb Bok choy
- cut into 1-in pieces
HEAT THE WOK over a high flame for 1 minute. Add the oil, and when
the oil is very hot (this will take just a few seconds; pass your
hand over it to feel the heat, or look for a wisp of smoke), add the
salt, garlic and bok choy. A common mistake is to skimp on oil in
stir-frying vegetables, which makes them dry out and burn. Use enough
oil to coat the vegetables thinly but thoroughly. This may be
prepared in advance and served cold.
