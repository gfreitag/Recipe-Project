Chef's Note:  This soup has been on the menu at the restaurant at The
Mansion on Turtle Creek since it opened in 1985. According to
executive chef Dean Fearing, "When Tortilla Soup is ordered, it is
brought to the table in a tureen for individual service by the
waiter, who garnishes each bowl according to the customer's desire."
