FILLING:

Equiv ) -- stiffly beaten
*A Note from Suzy: As we do not use RAW/UNcooked eggs here in the
northeastern United States due to salmonella bacteria I have
substituted a product called "Just Whites", it works just as well if
not better than egg whites.

CRUST: Combine coconut, flour and melted margarine. Press on bottom
of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 12-15 minutes
until lightly browned. Remove from oven and set aside.

FILLING: Soften gelatin in 1/4 c. cold water. Set aside. In a saucepan
combine egg yolks, 3.4 c. water 3.4 c. sugar. Stir over medium heat
for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add softened gelatin and stir
until dissolved.

Beat cream cheese at low speed while gradually adding gelatin/ egg
mixture until well blended. Stir in lime juice, grated lime, few drop
green coloring. Fold in whipped cream and stiffly beaten egg whites.

Pour filling over cooled crust and chill until firm.

Remove from springform and garnish with grated lime rind. In summer
decorate serving plate with fresh mint leaves if desired.
