In a deep saucepan place 2 cups of milk, 1/4 up of sugar and the mint
sprigs and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat and allow it to sit
for 5-10 minutes. Remove mint and discard. Return pan to moderate
heat and add the bittersweet chocolate. Whisk frequently until
chocolate melts into milk, then remove from heat.

In a separate bowl, mix the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, salt, cornstarch,
cinnamon and cocoa together. Add the remaining 1/4 cup milk and whisk
until smooth. Slowly whisk in the hot milk mixture and return to the
saucepan over moderate heat. Stir sides and bottom constantly with a
spatula until mixture just begins to simmer. Slowly whisk into bowl
with eggs, being careful not to scramble them. Return to pan and cook
over low heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, to cook egg
through and thicken mixture. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.

Pour pudding into dessert glasses or ramekins, cover with plastic or
wax paper directly on pudding to keep skin from forming and
refrigerate for up to 3 days. To serve, carefully remove plastic and
garnish with lightly whipped cream, chocolate shavings and mint
sprigs if desired.
