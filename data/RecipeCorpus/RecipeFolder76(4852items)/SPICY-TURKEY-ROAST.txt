1) Remove mesh from the turkey.  Lay turkey out as flat as possible
on a cutting board, placing the skin side down. 2) Combine the
garlic, rosemary, pepper and salt in the work bowl of the food
processor withthe steel blade in place, or in the blender.  Turn
motor on. Add the oil, processing until coarsely chopped. 3) Spread
half the garlic mixture over the inside of the turkey.  Reroll the
turkey. 4) Tie firmly with string every two inches to return the
turkey to its original log shape. Spread evenly with the remaining
garlic mixture. 5) Place on rack in roasting pan. 6) Roast at 350
degrees for 1-1/2 to 2 hours until a meat thermometer inserted in the
center registers 170 degrees. A long log shape takes less time than a
more compact roast. 7) Remove from oven. Let stand 20 minutes before
removing strings. 8) Cut thin slices to serve. Garnish with rosemary
and red pepper. Scrape up cooking juices from bottom of pan. Spoon
over meat, or thicken with flour and add chicken broth for a gravy,
if desired.
