Title: THE ARK BARBEQUE SAUCE
Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Tomato sauce
3 c  Tomato ketchup
1/2 c  Liquid smoke
2 c  White vinegar
1 tb Tabasco
1 sm Onion -- diced fine
3 tb Prepared mustard
3 lg Cloves  garlic -- minced,
1 1/2 c  Brown sugar
Combine everything in a large pot and mix well. Bring mixture to
rolling boil over high heat, stirring frequently from bottom to keep
onions and garlic from settling to the bottom and scorching. When it
boils, turn heat down and simmer 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Take from heat;
cool at room temperature. Once cooled, cover and refrigerate. It will
keep well for up to a month if covered properly refrigerated.

Serve this sauce with oysters in the shell or with prawns in a
casserole. Oysters, fresh  shucked and topped with this sauce and
then with parmesan cheese, are wonderful.

Another idea for serving: spread the sauce lightly on 6-8 oz salmon
fillets in a baking dish and bake for about 12 minutes in a 425
degree oven.

Wonderful on sliced beef or chicken for quick lunch sandwiches.

Cut French bread, spread the sauce on it, add Double Gloucester or
Leicester cheese and toast/broil from the top.

Or put poached egg on bread or English muffin, spread sauce over the
egg, add grated cheddar cheese, top with jalapeno slices and
toast/broil till the cheese melts. Serve with chilled fruit for a
perfect breakfast.
