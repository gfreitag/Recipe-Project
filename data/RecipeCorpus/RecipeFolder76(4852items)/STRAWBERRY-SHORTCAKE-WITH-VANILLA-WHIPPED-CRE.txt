Yield: 4 Servings

3 tb Fresh lemon juice
12 c  Sugar
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
6 tb Cold unsalted butter -- cut

Recipe in
Living Page 10D)
Heat oven to 375 degrees. Place strawberries in a bowl; sprinkle with
lemon juice and 1/4 cup sugar. Let stand to release juices, about 1
hour.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar, flour,
baking powder and salt. Use a fork or two knives to cut in butter
until mixture resembles coarse meal.

Whisk together egg and 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons cream. Slowly add
this mixture to dry ingredients; mix with a fork until dough just
comes together. Do not overmix.

Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface; pat into a 6-inch
square. Cut four 21/2-inch rounds; place on a parchment-lined baking
sheet. Whisk together egg yolk and remaining tablespoon cream; brush
over tops of biscuits. Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
Cool slightly on wire racks, about
15    minutes.

Slice shortcakes open while warm. Divide strawberries and their juice
among bottom halves of shortcakes; top with large dollops of Vanilla
Whipped Cream and upper halves of shortcakes. Serves 4.
