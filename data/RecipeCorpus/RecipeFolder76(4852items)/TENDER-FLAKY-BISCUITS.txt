Title: TENDER FLAKY BISCUITS
Categories:
Yield: 16 Servings
2 c  Plus 2 tbsp cake flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts EACH baking soda and salt
1/2    Stick cold margarine (not
Spread) -- cut in small
Cubes
3/4 c  Buttermilk
Heat oven to 450.  Have a baking sheet ready.

In a medium bowl, mix flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Cut
in margarine with pastry blended, or work in with fingertips until
lumps are no larger than small peas. Stir in buttermilk with a fork
until mixture clumps together. Press dough into a ball.

On a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll
dough into a 10x6-inch rectangle. With the long edge facing you, fold
in both short ends so they meet in center. Fold dough in half (as if
you were closing a book), forming a packet 4 layers thick. Roll dough
into a 6-inch square.

With a floured knife, cut dough into 16 squares, using a straight
downward motion with each cut (don't saw dough). Place biscuits 1 1/2
inches apart on ungreased baking sheet.

Bake 10-12 minutes until biscuits are lightly browned. Removed to a
wire rack to cool.
