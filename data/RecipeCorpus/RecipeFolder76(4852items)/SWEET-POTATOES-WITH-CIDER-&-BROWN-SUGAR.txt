Title: SWEET POTATOES WITH CIDER & BROWN SUGAR
Categories: Potatoes
Yield: 8 Servings
4 lb Sweet potatoes, peeled and
Cut into 1-inch chunks
2 1/2 c  Unsweetened apple cider
1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
1    Stick unsalted butter
2" piece of cinnamon stick
In a large nonreactive saucepan, combine the potatoes, cider, brown
sugar, 6 tablespoons of the butter and the cinnamon stick. Bring to a
boil over moderate heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer, partially cover
and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are very tender,
about 45 minutes. Let cool slightly, remove the cinnamon stick, and
pass the potatoes through the medium disk of a food mill or puree in
batches in a food processor. Transfer to an overproof serving dish.
The potatoes can be prepared to this point up to 4 days ahead. Cover
tightly and refrigerate. Return to room temperature before
proceeding. Preheat the oven to 325F. Dot the potatoes with the
remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, cover with foil and bake, stirring
once or twice, for about 20 minutes, until steaming. Remove the foil
and bake for
5    minutes longer.
