Known in some areas as vegetable pear or christophine, and as
mirliton in Louisiana, delicate-tasting chayotes (Sechium edule) are
superb when stuffed New Orleans Creole style. They're also wonderful
sliced, steamed until crisp tender, and dressed, along with their
edible single large seed, in a mustard vinaigrette. [PATh 12 Oc 96

Cut off and discard stem end from each squash and slice the vegetable
in half lengthwise. Remove seeds and use in another dish, if desired.
If necessary, cut a thin slice off the rounded side of each half so
it will sit level.

Place halves on a steamer rack set over simmering water, cover, and
steam until crisp-tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from steamer and
let stand until cool enough to handle. Using a spoon, scoop out the
flesh from each squash half into a bowl, leaving a shell about 1/4
inch thick; reserve.

STUFFING:  Heat 3 tablespoons each oil and butter in a skillet over
medium-high heat. Add the yellow and green onions, sweet pepper, and
celery and saute until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add
the garlic and saute 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes, reserved squash
pulp, parsley, thyme, and bay leaf and continue to cook until all the
vegetables are almost tender, about 5 minutes longer. Reduce the heat
to medium-low, stir in the shrimp pieces, and cook until they turn
bright pink. Stir in cooked crab and bread crumbs and season to taste
with salt and black and cayenne peppers.

Mound the stuffing mixture into the reserved squash halves. Dot the
tops with butter and place in a greased baking dish. Bake until the
tops are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Garnish with thyme sprigs
and lemon wedges and serve piping hot.
