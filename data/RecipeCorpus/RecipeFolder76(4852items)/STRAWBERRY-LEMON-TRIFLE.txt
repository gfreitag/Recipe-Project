FOR THE GENOISE: Preheat oven to 350F. Break the eggs into the bowl
of an electric mixer and whisk in salt, then sugar. Place the bowl
over a pan of simmering water and whisk until just lukewarm. Whip by
machine until cold and increased in volume, about 4-to-5 minutes. Mix
cake flour and cornstarch. Sift over egg foam in 3 or 4 additions,
folding it in with a rubber spatula. Pour the batter into a buttered,
paper-lined 10-inch round pan and level it off. Bake the Genoise
layer about 30 minutes until it is well risen, golden and beginning
to shrink away from sides. Unmold immediately and cool on a rack.
Bake and cool the Genoise layer. FOR THE LEMON FILLING: Combine lemon
juice, sugar and butter in a non-reactive saucepan. Bring to a boil
over low heat. Whisk yolks in a bowl and whisk in 1/3 mixture. Return
remaining lemon mixture to a boil over low heat and whisk in yolk
mixture. Continue cooking several minutes, whisking constantly, until
thickened and just at a boil. Pour into a bowl, press plastic wrap
against surface and chill. Immediately before using, whip cream and
fold into lemon curd. FOR THE STRAWBERRY SYRUP: Combine water and
sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Rinse, hull and puree
strawberries. Add puree and kirsch to syrup off the heat. Strain and
chill. To assemble, rinse remaining berries and reserve six for a
decoration. Hull and slice remaining berries. Cut Genoise into thin
vertical slices. Place a layer of cake slices in a glass serving
bowl. Moisten cake with syrup and strew with 1/4 each of the sliced
berries, almonds and jam. Spread with 1/4 of the lemon filling.
Repeat with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of cake slices
and syrup. Whip remaining cream and spread half on the trifle.
Decorate border with remaining cream (pipe with a star tube) and
reserved strawberries. Chill until serving time.
