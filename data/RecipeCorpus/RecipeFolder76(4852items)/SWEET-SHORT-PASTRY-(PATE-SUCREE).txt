100 g  Butter, diced (4 oz)

Put the flour on the work surface and make a well in the centre. Put
the butter in the well and work with your fingertips until completely
softened. Add the sugar and salt, mix well, then add the eggs and mix
again. Gradually draw the flour into the mixture. When everything is
well mixed, knead the dough 2 or 3 times with the palm of your hand
until it is very smooth.

Roll the dough into a ball, flatten the top slightly and wrap in
clingfilm. Leave to rest in the fridge for several hours before
using. It will keep well in the fridge for 3 or 4 days, or can be
frozen for several weeks.
