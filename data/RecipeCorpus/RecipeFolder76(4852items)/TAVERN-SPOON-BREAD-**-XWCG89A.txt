Spoon bread, or batter bread, is a custardy corn bread served souffle
hot from the dish, preferably earthenware, in which it is baked. It
is said that the recipe just happened when a mixture used to make a
corn bread enriched by milk and eggs was left forgotten in a hot
oven.  Virginians have ever since made spoon bread one of their
favored foods.  It is excellent served with herring roe, bacon, or
fried apples. _______________________________________________________
