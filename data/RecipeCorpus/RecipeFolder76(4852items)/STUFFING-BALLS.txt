Title: STUFFING BALLS
Categories: Dressings, Holiday
Yield: 16 Servings
1 x  Turkey giblets
8 tb Butter
4    Celery tops
20 sl Bread
20 sl Bread, salt rising
16 oz Pepperidge Farm stuffing
2 c  Chicken stock
2    Onions, chopped
2 c  Chicken stock
Boil giblets, butter, and celery tops until done. Toast breads, then
break toast into small pieces.  Add Pepperidge Farm stuffing to
toast. Cook chopped onions in stock. When tender, add to bread mix.
If dressing is too dry, add chicken stock for additional moisture.
Preheat oven to 350. Form into serving-size balls and place in
buttered baking dish. Spoon additional broth over balls. Bake 1 hour
or until brown.

This dressing is moist and is very easy to serve.  If I have too much
for Thanksgiving I freeze uncooked balls and use them at Christmas
which helps speed up dinner that busy day. I hope that your kids will
like this recipe; mine always liked the balls.

The one secret to my dressing is Salt Rising bread. My Grandmother
always used it with other bread (we had to keep it a secret because
my father hated salt rising even though you can not tell is is in
there). I also have a hard time making just a little dressing and it
always looks like I'm fixing for an army.
