Remoulade sauce is another Louisiana specialty that varies with the
cook. A piquant mustard-based sauce, it is excellent on cold shrimp
or crab meat, and also goes nicely with hot, crisp fried fish or
shellfish. Try it spooned over hard-boiled egg halves as an
appetizer, or use it as a dip for cooked artichokes.

~----------------- In a medium bowl, whisk together the mustard,
paprika, Tabasco sauce, salt, and pepper. Beat in the vinegar and
then, whisking constantly, add the oil in a slow, thin stream,
continuing to beat until the sauce is thick and smooth.  Stir in the
green onions, celery, and parsley and mix well. Cover the bowl and
let the sauce stand for at least 2 hours before serving to allow the
flavors to blend. Makes 2 cups.

Lagniappe - One-quarter teaspoon of Tabasco sauce gives a pleasing
tang to Hollandaise, Bearnaise, or white sauce.
