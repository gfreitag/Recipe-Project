Title: SPICY CREAM SAUCE WITH SHRIMP FOR LINGUINE
Categories: Tuna
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Flour
1 c  Whipping cream, light
2 tb Marinara sauce
12 oz Shrimp, cooked
1/2 c  Vegetable broth
1 pn Red pepper flakes
1/4 ts Tabasco sauce -- red
Pepper
2    Scallions -- diced
Fresh basil
Salt -- optional
3/4 lb Linguine -- cooked and
Drained
Ingredient Substitutes -- Cream - 1% milk with 1/4 cup Carnation NFDM
powder; or evaporated skim Marinara - tomato sauce; chili sauce
(Heinz); bottled pasta sauce (meatless) Linguine - long pastas like
spaghetti, vermicelli, fettucini. Vegetable broth - fish stock; no
fat and low-salt chicken broth; water.

Prepare pasta.  Shrimp will take 6 to 8 minutes. Make a white sauce --
moderate heat in skillet,  warm olive oil, stir in flour; cook (no
browning), about 1 minute. Remove from heat; stir in the cream. Reduce
heat. Return pan to burner and simmer until thick (about 2 minutes).
Sauce needs to come just to a boil to thicken. Stir in the marinara
sauce. Keep warm.

In separate pan, heat broth, add seasonings and green onions. Add and
cook shrimp until pink.  Add broth from shrimp to the sauce. Taste.
Adjust tabasco. Add salt. Gently transfer shrimp to sauce. Serve over
linguine.

This is good with the smaller shrimp.

Variations-- Add diced sweet bell peppers (fresh) to sauce. Add diced
tomato pulp (no juice, no seeds). Use milk for the sauce and add 1/2
cup ricotta cheese. Add carrots and peas (primavera). Add 1
tablespoon minced, young leaves from society garlic or chives.

Mix the shellfish -- crab, lobster, shrimp.  Okay with imitation
varieties of crab and scallops. Okay with chicken, but use milk and a
touch of sour cream instead of whipping cream.
