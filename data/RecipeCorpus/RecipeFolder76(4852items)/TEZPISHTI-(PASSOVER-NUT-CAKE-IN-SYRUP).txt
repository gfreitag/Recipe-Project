~Jewish, Turkish
2 c  Sugar
2 c  Water
2 ts Lemon juice
5    Eggs
1 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Oil
1    Orange's juice and rind, ~rind grated
2 ts Cinnamon, ground
1 1/4 c  Passover fine matzoh cake ~meal
1 1/4 c  Blanched almonds, finely ~chopped

1.  First make the syrup.  Mix the sugar and water together in a pan
and bring to a boil.  Add the lemon juice and simmer over low heat
from 10 minutes.  Cool the syrup.

2.  To make the cake, beat the eggs until frothy, add the sugar, and
continue to beat until golden and well mixed.

3.  Add all the other ingredients, one at a time, and stir them into a
batter.  Pour the batter into a oiled and floured cake pan, 13x9x2"
and bake in a 350 degrees F oven for 30 minutes. Test the doneness
with a toothpick.

4.  Remove the cake from the oven and pour the cooled syrup over it.
Let the cake stand for 2 hours before serving to allow the syrup to be
absorbed.

Serve at any Passover event, but especially with Turkish coffee.
Makes 1 cake, about 18 pieces.

This wonderful cake is a Passover favorite for visiting friends and
foreigners from New York.  Like so many Turkish sweets, the cake is
bathed in a syrup that keeps it moist but not soggy. The cool syrup
is poured over the hot cake when it is removed from the oven. Almonds
are the nut of choice but there are those who prefer the flavor of
walnuts.
