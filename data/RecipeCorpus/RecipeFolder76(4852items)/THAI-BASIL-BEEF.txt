Title: THAI BASIL BEEF
Categories: Thai, Beef, Spices
Yield: 2 Servings
4 tb Peanut oil
3    Cloves garlic
3    Jalapeno peppers (yes,
-really 3!)
1 lg Green bell pepper
1 lb Beef steak
2 tb Thai fish sauce
1 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Ground white pepper
1/2 c  Chopped fresh basil
-OR-
1 tb Dried basil is a weak
-substitute, but will work
Peel and chop garlic.  Seed jalapenos and remove membrane. Slice. Cut
green pepper into thin slices. Beef should be thinly slice across the
grain.

Heat wok and add the oil and garlic.  Chow for a very brief moment.
Then add the peppers, chow for a few minutes. Next add meat. Chow
again for just a couple of minutes so that the meat sears to medium
rare.

Quickly add the remaining ingredients and toss for a moment.

Serve with thin noodles or rice. 2 generous serving.
