MMMMM----------------PEANUT-COCONUT MILK DRESSING---------------------
1 1/2 c  Coconut milk
1 tb Red curry paste, see recipe
2 c  Unsalted chunky peanut

1/2 c  White vinegar
1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
SALAD: Arrange the lettuce, tomatoes, onion, carrot & cucumber in a
salad bowl & lightly toss.  Add the bean curd & sprouts. Top with the
peanut- coconut milk dressing & garnish with potato chips. DRESSING:
In saucepan over medium heat, stir the coconut milk & red curry paste
together until the mixture turns to a pale amber & a thin coat of oil
appears on the surface. Add the remaining ingredients & stir over a
low heat for 7 to 10 minutes, or until all the ingredients are
thoroughly mixed. The colour will be a pale cocoa brown. Let cool to
room temperature for 1 hour before serving with the salad. The
dressing will keep in the refrigerator for a month, but it does have
a tendency to thicken.  To bring it back to its correct consistency,
add 1/2 ts to 1 tb white vinegar & stir vigorously.
