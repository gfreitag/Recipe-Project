Title: SPINACH & RICE GRATIN
Categories: French/prov, Autumn, Main dishes, Rice, Summer
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Fresh spinach -- thawed
3 tb Olive oil
1 md Onion -- chopped
2    Garlic cloves -- minced
1 1/2 c  Cooked rice
2 oz Gruyere cheese -- grated
2 tb Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
Grated
1/2 c  Parsley -- chopped
Salt and pepper -- to taste
1/2 ts Dried thyme
3    Eggs -- beaten
2 tb Fine dry breadcrumbs
Heat a large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat and add the
spinach. Cook, stirring, until it wilts in the water left on its
leaves. It will take about a minute for all the spinach to wilt after
the water on its leaves reaches a boil. Transfer to a colander and
press out as much water as possible. When the spinach is cool enough
to handle, wrap it in a towel and squeeze out more water. Chop fine.
If you're using defrosted spinach, squeeze out the water.

Preheat the oven to 375#161#F. Brush a 2-quart gratin dish with olive
oil.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed nonstick
skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and saute, stirring, until
tender and just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic
and spinach. Stir together for about 30 seconds, then transfer to a
large bowl. Stir in the rice, cheeses, parsley, thyme, and beaten
eggs. Add salt and pepper to taste. Turn the mixture into prepared
gratin dish and smooth the top with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle on
the breadcrumbs and drizzle on the remaining olive oil.

Bake for 30 minutes or until the gratin is set and the top golden
brown. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Cover and refrigerate.
Cut into squares and serve.

COMMENTS: This is really delicious, but make sure to season well with
salt and pepper or it can be a little bland. Keeps well for several
days and makes perfect picnic food.
