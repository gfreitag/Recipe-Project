It is best that the hen you use died of old age or at least was on
Social Security in her later years. The chicken should stew for 1 to
3 hours and a frying chicken would fall apart. Use a stewing fowl.
Disjoint the pieces and fry until slightly browned. Remove. Add wine,
apples, celery, onion, a few leaves of cilantro, basil, a pinch of
tarragon and 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of paprika to pot. Cover and stir
frequently until mixture is tender. Add chicken and stock, cover and
cook until chicken is just tender. It may take from 1 to 3 hours
depending on age of chicken. Check frequently so you don't overcook.
Remove and place chicken in a shallow roasting pan. Run vegetables
through food mill. If there is too much liquid, boil down. Thicken
with beurre manie, add sour cream and heat - but not to boiling. Add
chicken base or bouillion cubes instead of salt. Pour over chicken
and sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese. Place under broiler until
cheese is bubbling and slightly brown. Modified from Becker's "Joy of
Cooking." I hope you like it. Jim Kessler RBFV65A
