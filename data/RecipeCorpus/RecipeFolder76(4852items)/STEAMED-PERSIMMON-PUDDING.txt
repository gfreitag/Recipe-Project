Title: STEAMED PERSIMMON PUDDING
Categories: Puddings, Holiday
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Persimmon pulp,
-pureed (about 2
-large persimmons)
1/2 c  Milk
2 tb Butter, melted
2 ts Vanilla extract
2 c  Flour, all-purpose
1 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 c  Raisins, golden
1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
Blend together the persimmon pulp, milk, butter and vanilla. Sift
flour, measure, and sift again with sugar, soda, salt and cinnamon.

Combine the liquid ingredients with the dry ingredients, and stir in
the raisins and nuts.  Pour into a well-buttered 6-cup mold. Cover
tightly with a buttered lid.

Place the mold in a deep pan, using a rack or inverted perforated
foil pan to keep the mold out of the water. Pour boiling water into
the deep pan just up to, but not touching, the mold.

Cover tightly and keep the water simmering; add boiling water as
necessary. Steam the pudding for 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours,
depending upon the size and shape of the mold.  The pudding is done
when a toothpick comes out clean.

Cool about 10 minutes before unmolding.  Serve warm, with hard sauce.
