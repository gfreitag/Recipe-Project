A stir-fry with shrimp, vegetables and noodles that make a great
one-dish meal. When using a nonstick skillet to stir-fry, you need
only a tiny amount of oil. For dessert, cheese and pears round out
the four food groups in this meal. Gingersnap cookies are a good
choice since they satisfy a sweet craving but are lower in fat than
most types of cookie.

Sweet and spicy shrimp make an easy, impressive dinner. If you
prefer, you can use wide noodles.

Cut onion in half lengthwise; slice lengthwise into thin strips. Cut
snow peas in half diagonally; set aside.

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook noodles for 7 minutes or
until tender but firm; drain.

Meanwhile, in nonstick wok or large skillet, heat oil over medium-high
heat; cook onion, garlic and ginger, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add
shrimp and snow peas; cook, stirring, for 1 minute.

In bowl, whisk together stock, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, vinegar,
cornstarch and hot pepper sauce; stir into shrimp mixture. Increase
heat to high; cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until shrimp are firm
and pink and sauce is thickened.

Toss noodles with shrimp mixture. Sprinkle with peanuts.
