A Louisiana tradition, these spicy pecans are eagerly anticpated by
friends visiting your home during the holidays. The slow roasting in
a low oven gives them extra crispness. They make a real nice gift,
too. ~------------------------------------------------------
~----------------- Preheat oven to 250oF.  In a small skillet, melt
the butter over medium heat.  Add the garlic, Tabasco sauce and salt;
cook for one minute. Toss the pecans with the butter mixture and
spread the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet.  Stirring
occasionally, bake for 1 hour, or until the pecans are crisp. From:
