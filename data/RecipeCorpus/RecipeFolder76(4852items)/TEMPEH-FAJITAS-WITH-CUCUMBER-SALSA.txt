Combine the marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Stir in the tempeh,
bell peppers and onion.  Marinate at least 30 minutes or up to 2
hours. Preheat oven to 450 F. In a small bowl combine the salsa
ingredients. Cover and chill until ready to use. Sprinkle a little
water on each tortilla and rub it into each tortilla with your
fingers. Stack the tortillas, then wrap in foil.  Set aside. Spread
the marinated tempeh and vegetables on a baking sheet in one layer.
Bake 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender anfd tempeh
begins to brown. So not toss while cooking. Place the tortilla packet
in the oven for about 7 minutes. This will heat the tortillas with a
little steam to soften them. To serve, place a tortilla on each
plate. Spoon some of the tempeh mixture along the center, cover with
a little cucumber salsa, then fold and roll to enclose the filling.
