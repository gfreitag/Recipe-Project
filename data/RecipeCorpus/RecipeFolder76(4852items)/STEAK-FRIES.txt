Gordon Menzies of San Francisco maintains that this recipe will be in
a cookbook he plans to publish soon.

Place potatoes in a plastic bag such as those used in gro- cery
produce sections.

Add remaining ingredients; twist top of bag to create a balloon like
compartment.

Gently twist and massage potatoes in bag so oil and season- ing are
spread throughout potatoes.

Dump potatoes onto cookie sheets in a single layer, cut side down;
use two cookie sheets if needed.

Bake in a 375 degree F. oven, turning at least twice, until potatoes
are lightly browned, about 30 to 40 minutes.

Serve immediately.
