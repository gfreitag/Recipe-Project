together. Chill. Roll about 2/3 of the dough out to a thickness of

the second measure of flour with the ricotta, nuts and angelica. Beat
the eggs until they are light and lemon colored. Gradually beat in
the sugar. Add the vanilla. Stir into the cheese mixture. Pour into
the lined cake pan(s). Roll the remaining pastry to a thickness of

of the tart(s). Bake until firm (about 40 minutes). Cool. Sift
confectioners' sugar lightly over the top(s) just before serving.
