Yield: 4 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
1 1/4 lb Lean ground beef
1 c  Crushed tortilla chips
1/4 c  Fresh or prepared salsa
1    Clove garlic; minced
6    Black olives; sliced
1/2 c  Yellow onions; chopped
1/4 c  Red pepper; chopped
1/4 c  Green pepper; chopped
1    Egg
1/2 ts Chili powder
1/4 ts Barbecue spice
1/4 c  Tomato juice
Black pepper; to taste
Fresh parsley sprigs; for
-garnish
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Stir all ingredients together except
for the parsley until it is well mixed. Place in a vegetable sprayed
or lightly oiled 5 x 9-1/2-inch loaf pan. Bake the meat loaf until it
is done and browned, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let it
stand about 5 minutes.  Take a knife and run it around the sides of
the pan to loosen. Invert the meat loaf onto a large plate or
platter. Garnish with the parsley if desired.  Serve.

Note:  I removed the accumulated juices and fat from the loaf pan
about half way through the baking (using a baster).
