Title: SUKSESSTERTE
Categories: Cake, Desserts
Yield: 1 Cake
7 oz Almonds
7 oz Icing/confectioner's
Sugar
1/2 ts Baking powder
5    Egg whites
Egg cream
5    Egg yolks
4 3/8 oz Sugar
1/2 c  Heavy cream
(I use 38% butterfat)
1 ts Gelatine (heaping)
5 1/3 oz Unsalted butter,
Room temperature (no
Margarine, please ; )
Vanilla, optional
3 1/2 oz Semisweet chocolate
(I use Freia's
Dronningsjokolade)
Brewed coffee,
Milk or butter
Grind the almonds. Mix almonds, icing/confectioner's sugar and baking
powder. Whip the egg whites until they are stiff. Very carefully mix
the almond-mix with the egg whites ("cut" them in). Bake at 175 C
(350 F) for app. 30 minutes in a round mould. It should be golden in
colour, but not brown around the edges.

Let the cake cool. Cut the cake in half horizontally (or make two).

Egg cream:  Heat egg yolks, sugar and cream over low heat until the
cream thickens. Do not boil. Stir constantly (Do not use a metal
whisk in an aluminium pot - except for Halloween - the egg cream will
turn green).

Put the gelatine in water for a few minutes. Then squeeze out excess
water. Heat in a double boiler until liquid. Mix the gelatine with
the butter. (Add vanilla if you use it). Stir well. Add this mix to
the egg cream, a little at the time.

Put the egg cream between the layers of the cake, save some. In a
double boiler, melt the semisweet chocolate. Put the melted chocolate
on top of the cake, decorate with the remaining egg cream. If the
melted chocolate is difficult to work with, add a _little_ brewed
coffee, milk _or_ butter.

This is a rich cake - it will go a long way!
