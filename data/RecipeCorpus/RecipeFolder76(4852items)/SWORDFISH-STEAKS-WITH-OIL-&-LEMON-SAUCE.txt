Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Oregano
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 lb Swordfish,cut into 1/2-in
Pepper,black
1. Preheat the broiler, or prepare charcoal for grilling. 2. Combine
the lemon juice and oregano in a small mixing bowl. Blend well, then
gradually add the oil while stirring with a whisk. Add a generous
amount of black pepper. This sauce is known as a Salmoriglio sauce.
3. When the broiler or charcoal grill is quite hot, place the fish
steaks under the broiler or on the grill. The fish should be quite
close to the source of heat so that it will cook quickly. 4. Cook
about 1 min. on one side, then turn the fish steaks carefully but
quickly and cook about 1 min. or slightly longer on the other side.
Do not overcook or the fish steaks will become dry. 5. Transfer the
fish steaks to a warmed platter and ladle the sauce over them.

This dish is named: Pesce al salmoriglio
