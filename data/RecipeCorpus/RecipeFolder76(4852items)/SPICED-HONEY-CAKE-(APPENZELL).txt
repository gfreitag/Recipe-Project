The Story:

The rural origins of Appenzell cookery are evident even in this
substantial honey cake. It is very fashionable during the festivities
at the end of the year to serve a spiced honey cake following the
example of the famous triangular "Biberli", which also blends honey
and spices. This recipe is inspired by the "Bacheschnitte" which are
served on the "Funkensonntag", a spring festival held to exorcise all
the evil spirits of winter by fire.

The recipe:

Gently heat the honey in a copper bowl or a bain-marie.

Heat the milk with the sugar separately then add to the honey and
stir well over a low heat. Leave to cool.

Put the flour into another bowl and stir in the honey mixture and
then the other ingredients.

Work all these together to a smooth consistency .

Place a greased flan ring (22 ... 24 cm diameter, 3.5 cm high) on a
baking tray and fill with the mixture.

Brush the top with milk and score a decorative pattern on the surface
using a fork.

Bake in the oven for 30 minutes at 180 oC (test with a needle).

When cold, decorate with icing.
