Combine the sesame oil and garlic powder and add chicken to marinate
briefly while wok or skillet is heating. Heat electric skillet or wok
to about 375 degrees and add chicken. STir-fry chicken about halfway
through, after 5-7 minutes. Add onions, celery and carrots and 2
tablespoons of the soy sauce. Stir-fry to mix and add the egg.
Continue mixing quickly. When egg is cooked, add cold rice and
remaining 2 tablespoon soy sauce. Stir-fry over high heat until rice
is hot. This would be good with crisp toasted pita bread and fresh
fruit.
