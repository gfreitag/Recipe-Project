tsp salt and1/8 tsp pepper. Mix well to combine. Divide into 18 small
balls.
Place 1 ball between two pieces of celery and press so that they hold
together. Roll in flour and lay on a piece of wax paper. Continue
until all the meat and celery have been used.
Beat the remaining eggs with a pinch of salt. Heat 1/2 cup oil in a
frying pan; dip stuffed celery in beaten eggs and fry until golden on
all sides. Place in a large skillet in a single layer. Add garlic,
tomatoes, 3 Tbsp oil, remaining parsley and small amounts of salt and
pepper. Place over medium heat and cook, covered for 25 to 30

of time. Reheat a moment before serving, it actually tastes better
than when served immediately after cooking.
