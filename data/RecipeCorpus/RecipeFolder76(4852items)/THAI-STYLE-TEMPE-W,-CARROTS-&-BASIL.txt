Categories: Vegetables, August, Thai
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 lb Tempe, sliced into 1" x 1/2"
x  1/2" pieces
3    Carrots, peeled & bias cut
Into about the same size as
Tempe
2 ts Crushed garlic
3    4 fresh hot chili peppers
(Thai, Seranno, or
Jalapeno), crushed
2 tb Oyster sauce*
1    2 teaspoons sugar
x  Fresh basil leaves (Thai or
Oly basil is best, Italian
Or sweet is ok)
Saute the tempe cubes in oil until golden but not burned. Remove &
drain on paper towels.

Stir fry carrots in 1 tablespoon oil for 3-4 minutes, until slightly
soft. Add the garlic & chilis for 30 seconds, stir, then add tempe &
mix it all up.

Add oyster sauce & sugar.  Stir fry for 2 minutes.

Mix in basil & serve with a mound of steamed rice.

*Oyster sauce is not usually vegan, but I think there are brands with
no oyster extract, only caramel & soy.
