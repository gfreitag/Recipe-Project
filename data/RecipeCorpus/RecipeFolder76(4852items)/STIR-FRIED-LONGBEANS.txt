Title: STIR-FRIED LONGBEANS
Categories: Vegetables, Oriental
Yield: 4 Servings
1 oz Cloud ear fungus
1/2 lb Chinese longbeans
-=OR=- Green beans
1 lb Silk squash or zucchini
2 tb Peanut oil
2 tb Finely chopped shallots
2 tb Coarsely chopped garlic
2 ts Minced peeled fresh ginger
2 tb Oyster sauce
2 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
2 tb Light soy sauce
2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Chicken stock
SOAK THE CLOUD EAR FUNGUS in warm water for at least 15 minutes.
Rinse them several times in cold running water to remove any sand.
Drain thoroughly and set aside. If you are using the Chinese
longbeans, trim the ends and cut them into 3-inch segments. If you
are using green beans, trim the ends and cut them in half. Peel off
the tough outer skin of the silk squash and cut the vegetable at a
slight diagonal into 2-inch pieces. Heat a wok or large saute pan
until hot and add the oil. Put in the shallots, garlic, ginger, cloud
ears and longbeans. Stir-fry for 1 minute, then add the silk squash,
oyster sauce, rice wine, soy sauce, salt, sugar and chicken stock.
Cook over high heat, uncovered, until the vegetables are tender,
about 5 minutes. Serve at once.
