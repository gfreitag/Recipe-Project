Title: THE POSTMODERN MIND
Categories: Alcoholic, Alcohol
Yield: 1 Serving
1/4 oz Creme de banana
1/4 oz Grand Marnier
1/4 oz Creme de cassis
1/4 oz Midori (melon liqueur)
In a well-chilled martini glass, layer liqueurs in order given by
trickling each across the back of a spoon whose tip is held against
the back of the glass (it's tricky; layers will be fuzzy). Or you can
just mix them all up and serve chilled. Serves 1.
