This recipe won two awards in the 1997 Medallion Salsa Challenge for
Amy Chaisson Selig of Your Personal Chef ~ first place for
professional chefs and a tie for most colorful. This recipe makes the
most of flavorful summer fruit.  Freshly grated ginger root gives it
a slightly piquant flavor. By using ripe seasonal fruit, you can
avoid adding a lot of sugar. Delicious over pancakes or French toast
dusted with powdered sugar. Place mango in a large bowl; add
strawberries, kiwi, blueberries, sugar, champagne, ginger root and
chopped mint. Taste and adjust sugar and ginger to taste. Garnish
with fresh mint sprig and serve. Makes 9 (2-tablespoon) servings. **
