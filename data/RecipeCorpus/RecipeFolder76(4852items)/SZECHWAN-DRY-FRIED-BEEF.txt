3/4 lb Boneless lean beef
1 tb Hot bean sauce
1 tb Dry sherry
1/2 ts Sugar
2    Small, dry, hot chile peppe
-crumbled & seeded
1/2 c  Salad oil

-matchstick pieces
2 ts Minced garlic
1 ts Minced fresh ginger
2    Whole green onions, cut in
-1 1/2" lengths
1 ts Sesame oil
1/2 ts Szechwan peppercorns
To prepare peppercorns, place in an ungreased frying pan and cook,
shaking pan frequently, over medium heat until aromatic; cool, then
crush with a mortar and pestle or rolling pin. Set aside. Cut meat in
slices 1/8 inch thick, then cut into shreds 1/8 inch wide and 2
inches long. In a bowl, combine the hot bean sauce, sherry, sugar and
chile peppers; set aside. Pour salad oil in a wok or small deep pan
and heat over medium-high heat to 360 degrees on a deep-frying
thermometer. Add 1/2 the meat and stir to separate shreds. Cook until
meat is dark brown, slightly shriveled, and chewy (about 2 1/2 to 3
minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
Reheat oil to 360 degrees and repeat with remainder of the meat.
Pour off all but 3 T oil.  Increase heat to high. When oil is hot,
add celery and carrot and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add garlic and
ginger and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add onion and stir-fry for 30
seconds. Return meat to pan, add hot bean sauce mixture, and cook,
stirring until most of the liquid has evaporated. Stir in sesame oil
and crushed peppercorns before serving.
