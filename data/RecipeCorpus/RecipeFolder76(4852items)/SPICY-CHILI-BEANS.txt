Canned beans cannot be used in this recipes; the cooking liquid from
the dry beans makes a rich, flavorful broth that forms the base for
the chili.
If you soak the beans overnight you can cut the cooking time in half.
Freeze any leftover chili for a fast meal later. Serve over brown rice
(make 3/4 cup per serving extra rice for tommorows breakfast).

Place the beans and water in a large pot.  Bring to a boil, cover,
reduce heat, and simmer for 2 hours.  Add the remaining ingredients
and cook an additional 2 hours. From the collection of Sue Smith,
