Cooking fresh crab in its shell retains the sweetness of the meat.
Eating crab cooked in this manner is an informal affair, allowing
enjoyment of the company and much conversation between friends.
~------------------------------------------------------
~----------------- Clean the crab by removing the shell from the body
only. Disjoint the legs and crack the shell of the legs with a
mallet. Rinse to remove small pieces of shell, drain and set aside.

Heat a wok or large skillet on medium-high heat.  Add the oil, garlic
and onion.  Stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the cracked crab pieces and
stir-fry for 2 minutes.

Add all remaining ingredients except the egg, cilantro and green
onions. Cover the skillet and continue cooking on medium-high heat
for another 3 minutes, or until the crab is cooked.

Add the egg and stir to combine thoroughly.

Remove to a serving dish and garnish with the cilantro and green
onions.
