SHELL AND DEVEIN the shrimp. In a bowl toss the shrimp with salt; let
sit for 5 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with cold water, drain and pat
dry; set aside. Cut the asparagus diagonally into 2-inch lengths.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Drop the asparagus into the
water and blanch for a few seconds or until it turns bright green.
Remove and shower with cold water to stop the cooking. If using
canned mushrooms, drain and rinse them with cold water; set aside.

oil and garlic; toss until lightly brown. Turn the heat to high and
add the green onions and shrimp to the wok; stir-fry together until
the shrimp turn bright orange and feel firm to the touch, about 30
seconds to a minute. Add the asparagus, mushrooms, sugar, pepper,
fish sauce, oyster sauce and chicken stock; stir-fry together until
the mixture is heated through and sauce has a light cream
consistency. This should take no more than a few seconds.
