1    Onion, finely chopped
1 cl Garlic, finely chopped
Olive oil for frying

These squid are also called Tripiroiak and Jibiones in various parts
of the Basque Country. In the rest of Spain, they are referred to as
calamares. Take apart and clean the fresh squid, taking care to
remove the ink sacs without breaking them. Set the ink sacs aside.
Cut the tentacles into one inch chunks.

Fry one onion and one garlic clove in olive oil. When the onion
begins to take on color, add the chunks of squid tentacles and cook
slowly while stirring in the oil. Add the chopped parsley and bread
crumbs and stir until well thickened.

Stuff the squid tails with this mixture, being careful not to
overfill. Seal the openings with a toothpick. Fry the stuffed tails
in a small amount of olive oil, turning gently, until golden in
color. Meanwhile make the ink sauce.

Ink Sauce:

Brown the other onion and garlic clove in olive oil, and add a crust
of bread. Place the fish broth in a small bowl. Place the reserved
ink sacs in a fine sieve our the bowl and puncture carefully. Blend
the ink and broth. Add this liquid to the onion and garlic and cook
slowly. Add the tomato puree and continue to simmer for a short time.
Run the mixture through a blender.

Place the sauce in a large skillet, add the fried, stuffed squid and
simmer for 15 minutes. Makes three to four servings. Walt
