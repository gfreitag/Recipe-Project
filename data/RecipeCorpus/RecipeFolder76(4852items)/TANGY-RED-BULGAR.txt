Title: TANGY RED BULGAR
Categories: Vegetarian, Slow cooker
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Olive or vegetable oil
1 c  Chopped red or green bell
-pepper, or combination
1 c  Chopped zucchini or yellow
-squash, or both
2 1/4 c  Bloody Mary mix or
-vegetable juice
1 c  Bulgur wheat
1 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Dired basil, crushed, or 1
-tablespoon fresh, minced
1/3 c  Chopped green onions
Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat.  Cook pepper(s) and
squash(es) until tendercrisp, 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Stir in Bloody Mary mix or vegetable juice, bulgur, lemon juice, and
basil. Heat to boiling.  Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer 5 to 8
minutes or until liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally.

Garnish with green onions.  May be served warm or as a salad at room
temperature.

To Microwave:

In a 2quart microwavesafe casserole dish, combine oil, red pepper and
zucchini.  Cover with lid; microwave on high 4 minutes or until
vegetables are tendercrisp, stirring twice during cooking.

Add vegetable juice, bulgur, lemon juice, and basil. Cover and
microwave 10 minutes or until liquid is absorbed, stirring twice
during cooking. Let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Garnish with green
onions.

Crockpot:

I have made this in a crockpot, tossing all the ingredients except the
basil and green onions in and cooking on low for 8 hours, adding the
basil after 7.5 hours, and garnishing with green onions just before
serving. The resulting dish is indistinguishable from one made using
the stove top method.  I refuse to try the microwave method. I
generally use only two cups of Bloody Mary mix since the brand I buy
comes in quart bottles.
