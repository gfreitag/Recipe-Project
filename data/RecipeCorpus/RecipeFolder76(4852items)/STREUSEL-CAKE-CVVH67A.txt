2  pk dry yeast 1/2 c butter 1/2 c warm water 4 c sifted all-purp.
flour 3/4 c milk 1/2 c sugar 1 x grated rind of one lemon 1 ts salt 3
ea eggs
PREPARATION Sprinkle yeast over warm water.
Heat milk, sugar, salt and> the 1/2 cup butter together 'til sugar is
dissolved and butter melted. Cool to lukewarm. Add dissolved yeast.
Place the flour blended with lemon rind in large mixing bowl; form a
well in the center. Add yeast-milk mixture and the eggs. Stir until
blended and smooth. Pour into a buttered 9x13-in baking pan,
spreading dough evenly. Let rise in warm place about 45 minutes.
NOTE: Next time I would inhibit rising to below edge of pan. Mine
rose quite actively, and because of the dough height, the rich
Streusel ran over in the oven a bit.
>>>> NOTE: Streusel
STREUSEL TOPPING
is properly pronounced (Stroyzel, not Stroosel. Streu (Stroy) means
to strew.) 1/2  cup butter 1 cup sugar 1/2 tsp cinnamon Chop butter
into the mixed sugar and cinnamon to form fine particles. Sprinkle
over top of risen batter. Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 30
minutes or until top is golden. NOTE: Author suggests top should be
syrupy, but >> authentic Streusel is crumby (not a negative remark,
quite the contrary! <G>) but moist enough to hold on the dough
without falling off.
