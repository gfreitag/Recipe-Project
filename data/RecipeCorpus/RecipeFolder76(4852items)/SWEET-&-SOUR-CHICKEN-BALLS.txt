5 tb Flour, divided

In a medium bowl, mix together the egg, garlic, salt and pepper. Add
the ground chicken and 2 tablespoons of the flour. Sprinkle the
remaining flour on a sheet of waxed paper. Drop the chicken mixture
by heaping teaspoons onto the floured waxed paper and roll in the
flour to form balls.

Heat the canola oil in a nonstick frypan over high heat. Add the
chicken balls and cook, turning, until brown, about 6 minutes. Remove
the chicken balls and drain on paper towels. Drain the oil from the
frypan, reserving 1 tablespoon.  Drain the juice from the pineapple
into a measuring cup; add water to make 1 cup liquid. Add the
bouillon cube to the pineapple juice and stir to dissolve.  Place the
frypan over low heat; add the pineapple chunks and green peppers.
Stir and cook for about 2 minutes. Combine the cornstarch, sugar and
ginger in a small bowl; stir in the soy sauce and vinegar until
smooth.  Add the pineapple juice and then the cornstarch mixture,
stirring, and cook until clear and thickened, about 5 minutes.

Arrange the chicken balls over sauce and serve with hot cooked rice
and crisp Chinese noodles.
