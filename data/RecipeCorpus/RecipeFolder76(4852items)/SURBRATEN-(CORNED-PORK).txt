Title: SURBRATEN (CORNED PORK)
Categories: Pork, German
Yield: 4 Servings
1 kg Pork (2 lbs 3 oz)
2    Onions, finely chopped
10    Juniper berries [crushed?]
1 lg OR 2 small cloves garlic,
-chopped
Brine:
1 l  Water (4 1/4 cups)
2 tb (approx.) salt
as much saltpeter as fits on the tip of a knife (optional)

Rub the meat with the chopped onion, garlic and juniper berries, then
push into a [tight-fitting] container and pour the cold brine (that
has previously been brought to a boil and then let cool again), with
or without saltpeter, over the meat.  Press down with a board and
weight it with a rock.  The meat has to remain in the brine for three
weeks, during which time it must be turned frequently. At the end of
the three weeks, remove the meat from the crock, briefly rinse it
off. Roast at 390 degrees F in hot lard, along with the chopped
onion, garlic and yellow turnip, until crispy, about 1 1/2 hours.

Serves 4.
