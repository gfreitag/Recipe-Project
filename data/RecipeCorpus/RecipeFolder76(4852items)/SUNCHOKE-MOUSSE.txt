Title: SUNCHOKE MOUSSE
Categories: Vegetables, Healthy
Yield: 4 Servings
1 3/4 lb Sunchokes
-(jerusalem artichokes)
2/3 c  Fromage blanc OR
2/3 c  Cottage cheese, lowfat
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
"Maniere serve a steamed sirloin steak with a mousse made from pureed
steamed sunchokes, low in fat because it's enriched with low-fat
cheese instead of cream. Steamed sunchokes make a magnificent buttery,
ivory-colored puree, silky smooth, nutty, and pleasantly sweet, like a
delicious winter squash. This low-fat recipe is superb, but if you
like, you can replace the cheese with a quarter cup of creme fraiche
(or the same amount of heavy cream mixed with half a teaspoon of
fresh lemon juice) and two to three tablespoons of butter. Serve this
mousse with fish and poultry dishes as well. Maniere made the mousse
up to an hour before the steak and then reheated it, in its serving
bowl, in a second steaming compartment, while the steak steamed. If
you don't have a steamer with two compartments, reheat the mousse in
another steamer or in a saucepan over low heat."

Put the sunchokes on the steamer rack, place over simmering water,
cover, and steam until tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from the
steamer, let cool slightly, and then peel with a pairing knife. Put
the sunchokes into the bowl of a food processor, add the fromage
blanc or cottage cheese, salt, and pepper and puree until smooth.
Transfer to a bowl to keep warm in the steamer, or transfer to a
saucepan and set aside.
