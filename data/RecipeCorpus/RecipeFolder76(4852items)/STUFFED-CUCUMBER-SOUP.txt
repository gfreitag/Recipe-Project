MMMMM--------------------PREPARING CUCUMBERS-------------------------
Select cucumbers which are 7 to 8 inches long, but as small around as
you can get. Peel the cucumbers and then slice each across into four
equal pieces. Using a small spoon scoop out the seeds being careful
to leave a "bottom" in each piece. Preparing the meat stuffing:
Combine the ground pork, garlic, ginger, Cilantro, 4 of the green
onions, and fish sauce. Make a small ball of the mixture and
microwave for about a minute to cook thoroughly.  Taste for
seasoning, and correct if needed. Using your fingers stuff the meat
mixture into the cucumbers (stick a toothpick through the side of the
cucumber and into the meat to hold it in place while it cooks), and
place in the hot stock. Cook about 15 minutes and add the 4 remaining
green onions cut in 2" lengths, the two carrots cut into matchsticks
and the canned quail eggs.  Cook another 5 minutes and serve
immediately. Note: If you can manage to keep the soup just barely
below the boil your finished soup will be very clear.  If that
doesn't work out don't worry.....it will taste just as good! Subj:
