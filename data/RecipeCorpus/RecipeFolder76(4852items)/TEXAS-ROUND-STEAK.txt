amount to make dredging pracitcal.) Place oil in a heavy frying pan
and heat to frying temperature over moderate heat. Add meat and brown
on both sides. Transfer steaks to a 1 1/2 quart casserole. Fry
peppers and onions over moderate heat in the pan in which the meat
was browned, stirring frequently. Remove vegetables with a slotted
spoon and spread over meat. Pour out any remaining fat. Add beef
broth to frying pan and cook and stir over moderate heat to absorb
and brown particles remaining in the pan. Add remaining ingredients
to broth.  Mix well and pour over meat. Stir the meat and vegetables
lightly with a fork to distribute the broth and vegetables. Cover
tightly and bake at 325 degrees for about 1-1 1/2 hours or until the
meat is tender.  Serve 1 piece of steak with some of the sauce per
serving. Food Exchange per serving: 1 FRUIT EXCHANGE + 3 LEAN MEAT
