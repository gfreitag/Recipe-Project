Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 8 Servings
8 lg Champignon mushrooms

Firm to touch)
2    Hard-cooked eggs
1 oz Grated cheese
(Parmesan or similar)
1 sm Sprig basil
1 tb Mayonnaise
Seasoning to taste
(salt, pepper, garlic
Powder or whatever)
Wash mushrooms and cut off stems. With stainless steel or plastic
teaspoon, scoop out mushroom heads. Store covered so they won't stain.

Put eggs, mayonnaise and the cut off mushroom stems in blender or food
processor and shred slightly, so mixture doesn't loose all its
texture.

Place mushroom heads upside down on greased baking sheet and fill with
mixture. Top up with the grated cheese. Bake or grill until cheese is
completely melted and starts to turn brown. Garnish with shredded
basil leaves.
