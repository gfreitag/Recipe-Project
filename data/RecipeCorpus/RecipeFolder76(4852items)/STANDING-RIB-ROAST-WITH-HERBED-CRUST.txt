Title: STANDING RIB ROAST WITH HERBED CRUST
Categories: Beef, Meats
Yield: 6 To 8 serv.
1    Standing rib roast (7-8 lbs)
-(about 3 or 4 ribs)
1/2 c  Fresh thyme leaves; chopped
-(reserve stems)
4    Garlic cloves; peeled and
-cut into slivers
1 tb Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  ;water
2    To 3 tablespoons flour
-optional
Preheat oven to 475 degrees F.  Dry the roast thoroughly. Lightly
score the fat, then rub the whole roast with the reserved thyme
stems. Rub the face and underside of the roast with half of the
garlic slivers. Rub the whole roast with the pepper and salt. Pierce
the fat layer just enough to insert the remaining garlic slivers--do
not pierce into the flesh. Pat and press the thyme leaves into the
scored layer of fat. Place the roast bones down in a shallow roasting
pan just large enough to hold it comfortably. Insert a meat
thermometer in the top of the roast; make sure it is not touching
bone.

Roast for 15 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and
roast until done to your liking: 125-130 degrees for rare, 140-150
degrees for medium, and 160-165 degrees for well done. Count on
cooking times approximately as follows:  For rare, cooking time is
12-15 minutes per pound; medium, 15-18 per pound; well-done, 18-20
minutes per pound.

Remove the roast from the oven and place it on a carving board. Let it
stand, loosely covered with aluminum foil, for 15 minutes before
carving.

Meanwhile, skim all but a few tablespoons of fat from the juices in
the roasting pan.  Place the pan over medium heat; add 1/2 cup of the
water and stir to deglaze the pan, scraping up any bits clinging to
the bottom of the pan.  Add the remaining water.  This juice can be
served with the roast. For a flour based gravy, stir in the optional
flour until it browns before adding the 1/4 cup of water.

To carve, place on a carving board or platter, and cut away the bones.
Place the roast cut-side down on the board and carve into 1/2- to
3/4-inch-thick slices. Serves 6 to 8. Source: San Francisco Chronicle,
