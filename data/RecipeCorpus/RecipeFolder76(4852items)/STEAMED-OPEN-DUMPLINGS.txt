Title: STEAMED OPEN DUMPLINGS
Categories: Oriental
Yield: 6 Servings
1 pk Wonton skins
-(about 30-35 skins per pkg)
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3/4 lb Ground pork
2 tb Minced Smithfield ham
-=OR=- Prosciutto
1 tb Light soy sauce
2 ts Rice wine or dry sherry
1 1/2 tb Finely chopped scallions
1 ts Finely chopped ginger root
1 ts Sesame oil
1    Egg; beaten
1 ts Granulated sugar
COMBINE THE FILLING ingredients and mix them together well. Spoon a
generous portion of filling onto each wonton skin. Bring up the sides
and press them around the filling mixture. Tap the dumpling on the
bottom to make a flat base. The top should be wide open, exposing the
meat filling. Set up a steamer or put a rack inside a wok or large
deep pot. Pour in about 2 inches of water and bring it to a boil. Put
the dumplings on a plate and place this into the steamer or onto the
rack. Cover the pot tightly, turn the heat to low and steam gently
for about 20 minutes. (You may have to do this in several batches.)
Serve the dumplings hot with soy sauce to dip.
