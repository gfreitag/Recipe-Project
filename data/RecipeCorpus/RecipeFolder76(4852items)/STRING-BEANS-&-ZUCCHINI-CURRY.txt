Categories: Side dish, Indian, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Fresh string beans
1/2 lb Fresh zucchini
1 lg Onion
1 tb Ghee
1 ts Cumin
1 ts Coriander
1/2 ts Turmeric
1/4 ts Chili powder
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/4 ts Dark mustard seeds
Salt, to taste
Wash the string beans in water.  Snap the stems off. Break beans into
2 inch long pieces.

With a vegetable brush, clean the zucchini thoroughly under some
running cold water.  Cut and throw away both ends of each zucchini,
and cut into small rounds.

Peel and cut onion into small pieces.

Over a medium heat saute the onion in butter or margarine. When the
onion is soft, add mustard seeds. When seeds start jumping, add
turmeric, cumin, and coriander powders. Saute onion again until it is
fully covered with spices.

Add string beans first.  Mix and cover them for 4 minutes.

Then add zucchini next.  Stir the pan.  Add chili powder, garlic
powder, and salt.  Cook for 8 to 10 minutes.

Serve hot or warm as a side dish.
