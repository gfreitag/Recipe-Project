2 ts Safflower oil
1/4 c  Brandy
3 c  Dry red wine
1 c  Defatted Beef Stock
1 tb Tomato paste
2    Cloves garlic -- mashed
1/4 ts Thyme
1    Bay leaf -- crushed

1. Cut meat into 1-inch cubes. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high
heat, sear beef in 1 teaspoon of the safflower oil until lightly
browned on all sides. Pour in brandy and ignite, shaking pan until
flames subside. Add wine, stock, tomato paste, garlic, thyme, and bay
leaf. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to simmer. Cook, uncovered,
until tender (about 20 to 30 minutes). Preheat oven to 200 degrees F.

2. Peel onions and cut a small X in the top of each to prevent them
from falling apart as they cook. In a small skillet over medium-high
heat, saute onions in 1 teaspoon of the olive oil. Add the water,
cover, and cook for
15    minutes.

3. Drain onions and set aside. In the same pan over medium-high heat,
saute mushrooms in the remaining 1 teaspoon safflower oil for 5
minutes. Set aside.

4. Remove beef from sauce and keep warm on a platter in the oven.
Bring sauce to a boil and reduce to half its volume by simmering,
uncovered, for 10 minutes. Combine together remaining olive oil and
flour and drop into boiling sauce by spoonfuls, stirring with a whisk
until sauce thickens.

5. Return beef to sauce, and add onions and mushrooms. Heat through
and serve over rice.
