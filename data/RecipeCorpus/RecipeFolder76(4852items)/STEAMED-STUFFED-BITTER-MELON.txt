1/2 lb Pork, ground [I minced it

4    Fresh water chestnuts,

1 ts Minced fresh ginger root
2 tb Minced scallion

1/2 ts Sugar
1 tb Thin soy sauce
1    Egg, lightly beaten
1 ts Cornstarch
2 lg Bitter melons, about 3/4 to
-1 lb.
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
2 tb Peanut oil
2 ts Minced garlic
1 1/2 tb Fermented black beans
1 tb Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
3/4 c  Chicken broth
Salt to taste
1/2 ts Cornstarch mixed with 1
-teaspoon cold chicken broth
1 tb Sesame oil
From Ken Hom's book,
-Chinese Technique.
Combine the stuffing ingredients in a large bowl.  Mix them
thoroughly. The hands are the best tool for this job.

Cut the bitter melon into 1-inch slices; discard the end pieces. With
a paring knife, trim out the insides. Lift them out. Stuff the cavity
of each slice with a generous spoonful of stuffing.

Arrange the stuffed pieces of vegetable on a plate and set the plate
on a trivet in a wok over enough hot water to come within 1 inch of
the plate. Cover the wok and steam the food for 20 minutes. Remove
the platter and trivet.

In a separate wok or pan, prepare the sauce.  First heat 2 tablespoons
peanut oil.  Add the garlic and fermented black beans, stir for a
minute, then add the Shaoxing wine, chicken stock and salt. Add the
liquid that results from the steaming of the melon.  Bring the
mixture to a boil. Thicken with the dissolved cornstarch and flavor
with sesame oil.

Pour the sauce over the bitter melons and serve.

Serves 2 as a main course.

NOTE:  Hom makes no mention of blanching although another bitter melon
recipe in another book *does* say that it will cut the bitterness.
