This very elegant salad comes to us from chef Willie White of New
Brunswick's fabulous Algonquin Hotel.  Chef White likes to garnish
this impressive salad with edible flowers such as nasturtiums or
chive blossoms. He says that a Sauvignon Blanc is a nice wine for
accompanying this salad.

For Salad: Cut cheese into 12 rounds, each 2 1/2 inches wide. Give
each cheese round a generous twist of freshly ground pepper and bake
at 400F for 5-6 minutes or until golden brown. Let cheese crisps
cool. Place 1/2 tsp. cream cheese on each parmesan crisp.  Layer each
one with strawberries and greens.  Top off with more greens set in
cream cheese. Garnish with 2 fresh chives and edible flowers, of
desires. Place wedges of strawberries around the plate an

For Dressing: Blend all ingredients except the oil. Add oil slowly
while mixing ( a food processor works well for the entire process).
The dressing is best when made a day ahead of time. Mix well before
serving.
