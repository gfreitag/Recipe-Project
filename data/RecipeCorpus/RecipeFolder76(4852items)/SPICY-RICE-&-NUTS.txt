Categories: Side dish, Grains, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
3 tb Vegetable oil or ghee
1 c  Diced celery
1 ts Asafetida
1 tb Ginger, grated
1/4 ts Chili seeds
1 ts Cumin seeds
1 ts Garam masala
3 c  Long grain brown rice
4 1/2 c  Water

1/4 c  Raisins
1/8 c  Cashews, toasted
1/8 c  Peanuts, toasted
1/8 c  Sliced almonds, toasted
1/8 c  Sesame seeds, toasted
Saute first 3 ingredients together till celery and/or onion turns
translucent.  Add the next 4 ingredients and fry till spices begin to
turn brown and you can smell them in the air. Add the rice and
stir-fry till it begins to turn golden brown.  Then add the next 3
ingredients, mix well with spoon and bring to a boil. Cover and turn
heat down to medium-low so it maintains a gentle roiling boil for 10
to 15 minutes. Turn down and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.  Garnish
with nuts and seeds before serving. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
