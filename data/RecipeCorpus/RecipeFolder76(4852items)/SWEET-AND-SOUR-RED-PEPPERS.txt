Title: SWEET-AND-SOUR RED PEPPERS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 2 Servings
1 lb Red bell peppers
2 tb Fruity olive oil
1    Garlic clove; thinly sliced
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Tomato paste
-(the kind you squeeze
- out of a tube)
1 tb Balsamic vinegar
Small basil leaves
-  left whole, -=OR=-
-Large Basil leaves
-  shredded
SLICE THE PEPPER INTO STRIPS 2- to 3-inches long and about 1/4-inch
wide--or whatever width appeals to you. They can be very skinny, or
nice and wide, too. Heat oil in a large skillet with the garlic. When
it's hot, add the peppers, sprinkled with salt, and stir so that all
are coated with the oil. Cook over a brisk heat, shaking the pan
occasionally until the peppers are hot and beginning to cook, about 5
minutes, then stir in the tomato paste. When it is well incorporated,
add the vinegar and stir. Continue to saute until the vinegar is
reduced and the peppers are as done as you like. They're good when
still somewhat firm--perfect for a little salad--but they can also
cook until they are very soft throughout-- good with pasta or heaped
on garlic- rubbed grilled bread. Toss in the basil, season with
pepper, and heap onto a serving plate.
