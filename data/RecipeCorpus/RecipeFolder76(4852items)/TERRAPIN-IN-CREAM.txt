*DIRECTIONS*

To cook terrapins:  Boil a few and pick them, cutting out the gall
bladder, which is attached to the liver. Be sure not to break the
gall sac. Reserve the eggs, and put all to stew with 1/2 pint of
claret, and rather more Madeira, until done.

Force egg yolks through a sieve, then cream then with butter. Scald
cream over hot water, add seasonings, and beat in egg yolk and butter
mixture. Add terrapin and sherry, and heat thoroughly.
