Title: TERIYAKI HONEY CHICKEN
Categories: Chicken, Japanese
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Fryer; cut-up
1/2 c  Honey
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Sherry, dry
1 ts Ginger, fresh; grated
-(substitute 2 tsp ground
-ginger, if you must)
2 md Garlic cloves, crushed
Place chicken in plastic bag. Combine remaining ingredients in small
bowl ad pour over chicken in bag, turning to coat. Close bag and
marinate in refrigerator for at least 6 hours, turning 2 or 3 times.
Remove chicken from marinade; reserve marinade. Arrange on rack over
foil-lined broiler pan. Cover chicken with foil. Bake at 350 degrees
for 30 minutes. Uncover; brush with marinade. Bake, uncovered, 30-45
minutes or until done, brushing occasionally with marinade. Four
servings.

[Note: When I try this, I think I'll do this on the gas grill and will
probably make double the amount of sauce so that, when I refrigerate
the leftovers for other meals, there will still be plenty of sauce
and it won't be dry.]
