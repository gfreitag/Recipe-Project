Mix the flour and salt together, then add the water, mixing to form a
firm dough. Roll into 6 to 8 balls with floured hands, then roll in a
little extra flour. Put into a saucepan of fast boiling water, cover
and boil hard for 20 minutes. Drain well and serve immediately with
rich, brown gravy as a starter or part of a main course or with
melted butter or golden syrup as a dessert. Serves 3 or 4. If the
dumplings are intended as a dessert, a few currants can be added to
the dough before boiling.

Suffolk  Dumplings,  also  known  as  Hard Dumplings, should be eaten
with two forks being pulled apart to let out the steam.
