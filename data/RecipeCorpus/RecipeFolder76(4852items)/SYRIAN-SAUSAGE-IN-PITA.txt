Categories: Sandwiches, Syrian
Yield: 6 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
2 lb Leg of lamb; ground once
2 tb Fresh tarragon; chopped
2 ts Ground coriander seed
1 ts Allspice
2 tb Red wine
1/4 c  Pine nuts
1 tb Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
5    Feet narrow sausage casing*
Butter and olive oil
6    Individual pita rounds
1    Bunch coriander; chopped
*Note: If you wish to skip the casing step, form the sausage meat into
patties and saute until brown.

To make the sausage meat, combine the first eight ingredients in a
large bowl.  Mix well with your hands. Using a sausage stuffer or a
pastry bag, stuff the casings, twisting every 3 inches.

Saute the sausage in a mixture of half butter and half olive oil until
brown, turning occasionally.  Serve in pita rounds, sprinkled with
plenty of chopped coriander. Makes 6 servings.

Served at the North Star Bar, Philadelphia.  The recipe comes from the
owner's aunt who used to cook for Arab dignitaries visiting the UN.
