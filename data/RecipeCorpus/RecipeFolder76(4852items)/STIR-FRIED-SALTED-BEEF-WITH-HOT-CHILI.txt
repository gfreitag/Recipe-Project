"A few years ago, the Chinese restaurant in the Amarin Hotel served
this dish which I copied.  The Amarin Hotel was a small hotel with
personalized services and very popular with many regular guests. I
worked for a short time at the dress shop there.  The Amarin Hotel is
no more, there is a big modern shopping plaza in its place now. The
shopping plaza has the first Macdonald Hamburger outlet in Thailand
situated there. It is doing very well.  I still miss the Amarin."

Marinate beef with salt and nam pla for 1 hour.  Heat frying pan and
cook the salted beef (without oil) for 5 minutes. Remove and drain on
paper towel.  Heat the oil in a wok over high heat to fry the salted
beef strips until crisp.  Drain oh paper towel.  Heat the remaining
oil.

Stir-fry hot chili, shredded celery and green onion for 1 minute. Add
fired crispy beef.  Season with Maggi sauce. Pour onto serving plate.
