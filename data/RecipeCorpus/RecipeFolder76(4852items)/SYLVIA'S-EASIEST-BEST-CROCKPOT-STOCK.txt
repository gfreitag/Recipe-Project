1    Turkey or chicken carcass
Water
1    Onions
2    Carrots
1 ts Celery seed; or stalks
2    Bay leaves
2 tb Parsley
1 tb Sage leaves
2 tb Oregano leaves
1 tb Rosemary leaves
2    Cloves, whole
Water
Cram as much of turkey carcass & leavings as will fit into crockpot.
(I usually only manage to get about 1/2 of a carcass in.) Use all the
leavings, including skin, even if you plan on defatting the stock. Add
remaining ingredients and cover with water to within an inch or so of
the top.  Cover crockpot and cook on low at least 2-3 DAYS (not a
tyop!). Defat, strain out solids, package in pints or quarts, and
freeze until needed.

Sylvia's comments: This recipe, that I developed, is the easiest I've
ever seen, and it produces the richest, most flavorful stock. If it's
inconvenient to let it cool and package it after 3 days, let it cook
another day or so until it is convenient.  You can't overcook it (at
least I haven't managed to), the longer it cooks the richer it gets.
I do check it every day or so to see if I need to add water, but I
rarely have to. Don't flinch at the cloves, they don't add a clove-y
flavor but they do add a nice hint of something. Since the stock is
unsalted, it is great for anyone trying to restrict sodium intake.
And it tastes so good that I try to snag turkey or chicken carcasses
whenever I can. Let others take home the meat and stuffing, I want
the carcass! <g> I also make stock from the bones of the whole KFC
Rotisserie Gold chicken we buy occasionally.
