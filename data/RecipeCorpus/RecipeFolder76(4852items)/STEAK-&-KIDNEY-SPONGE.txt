3 tb Flour
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Floured steak
1    Floured kidney
1    Onion, diced
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
2 tb Dry sherry
Beef stock
1 tb Butter
2    Eggs
50 ml Milk
200 g  Self-raising flour
This is the no-fuss version great-grandma probably made on washing
day when she hadn't the time to fiddle with pastry or pudding-making.
Though the dish spends a long time in the oven looking after itself,
it takes no time at all to make.

Put three tablespoons of plain flour seasoned with salt and pepper in
a plastic bag and shake to coat with flour. Transfer the floured
steak and kidney to a large casserole with a lid and mix in one
onion, diced. Over the top pour 1 tablespoon Worces- tershire sauce,
2 tablespoons dry sherry and sufficient beef stock to reach the top
of the meat. Cover the casserole and bake in a slow oven (140 degrees
C) for
3    hours.

Cream 1 tablespoon softened butter or margarine, add 2 eggs and 50 mL
milk and dredge in 220 g self-raising flour. Mix to a soft dough,
turn out onto a floury surface and with floury hands pat out to the
same dimensions as the interior of the casserole. Place the sponge
dough on top of the steak and kidney, press well around the sides of
the casserole and cook for a further half hour with the lid on. Cut
the sponge into wedges and serve on top of generous amounts of steak
and kidney.
