TAILLAULE FROM NEUCHATEL: the story

"Taillaule", a sort of sweetened bread, was made differently in the
past. It was a flattened ball of dough baked directly on the floor of
the oven. The surface was cut sharply with a pointed knife or snipped
with scissors to form deep parallel cuts. This gave rise to its name
"taillaule" meaning cut. These early "taillaules" had a somewhat
different flavour from the present day moulded loaves.

The recipe:

Add the yeast, eggs (1), sugar, malt, salt, lemon zest and flour to
the milk. Knead well to obtain a smooth dough. Add the softened
butter and knead again. Finally add the dried fruit.

Cover the dough and leave to rise in a warm place for about 1 hour.

Divide the dough into 2 equal parts as if making two French sticks and
place in 2 fruit cake tins.

Leave again in a warm place to rise to 3/4 height of tin.

Brush with beaten egg (2) and make zig zag cuts with the scissors in
the surface.

Bake in the tins at 200 oC for 25 minutes .

Remove from oven, brush with an apricot glaze and then coat with a
water icing.

Toasted flaked almonds can be sprinkled on top.

Recommended drink: tea or coffee.
