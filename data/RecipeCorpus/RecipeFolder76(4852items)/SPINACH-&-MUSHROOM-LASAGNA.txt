Title: SPINACH & MUSHROOM LASAGNA
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Harned 1994, Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
8    Lasagna strips
1 3/4 lb Spinach
1 ts Margarine
1 ts Marjoram
12 oz Ricotta cheese
Salt and pepper; to taste
6 oz Mushrooms
1 oz Margarine
1/4 pt Vegetable stock
1 ts Soy sauce
3 oz Grated Cheddar cheese
Cook lasagna in plenty of boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and
rinse in cold water.

Prepare the spinach by washing it in several changes of cold water.
Place in a heavy bottomed pot and cook gently without adding more
water, for 6 to 8 minutes. When cooked, strain off excess water and
chop finely. Return to the pot and season well.  Put pan on a gentle
heat, add margarine & marjoram, stir and then remove from heat. When
the spinach has cooled, mix in the ricotta. Check the seasoning.

To prepare sauce, saute the sliced mushrooms in margarine, reduce
heat and continue to cook for 10 minutes in a covered pot so that
plenty of juice is extracted.  Add the stock and simmer another 5
minutes. Puree in a blender for a few seconds.  Add soy sauce and
season to taste.

Lightly oil a square 3 pint dish, spoon in some of the spinach, cover
with 2 or 3 pieces of lasagna and then a coat of the mushroom sauce.
Repeat, ending with the mushroom sauce. Sprinkle with grated cheese.
Bake at 400 F. for 35 to 40 minutes.  Serve immediately.
