Categories: New, Text, Import
3 lb Prince Edward Island mussels
about 50 to 60
Yield: 4 Servings
:
1/2 c  dry white wine
2 1/2 c  basic tomato sauce
1 c  fresh basil leaves
1 c  fresh bread crumbs
1/2 c  extra virgin olive oil

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Clean and debeard mussels. Place mussels in a 12- to 14-inch sautJ
pan or large saucepan with the wine, cover and place over high heat
to steam. Mussels should steam open in 2 to 3 minutes. Drain mussels,
reserving liquid. Place liquid in a medium saucepan and add basic
tomato sauce. Bring to boil, lower heat to simmer and reduce to 2
cups. Allow to cool.

Meanwhile, open mussels and remove the piece of shell that the mussel
has detached itself from. Loosen the mussel from the second shell but
leave it intact in the shell. Lay the mussels on a large baking
sheet. Place 1/2 teaspoon tomato sauce mixture on each mussel.
Chiffonade all basil leaves and place several ribbons of basil over
each mussel. Sprinkle with half a teaspoon of bread crumbs, dot with
2 to 3 drops olive oil and bake for 4 to 5 minutes, or until hot.
Serve immediately with lemon wedges.
