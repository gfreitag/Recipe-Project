1 ts Cornstarch
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt

1. Remove and discard fat from meat. Cut meat across the grain into
thin slices.

2. Combine sherry, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, cornstarch, baking
soda, salt and garlic in medium glass bowl. Mix in meat. Cover and
refrigerate at least 3 hours.

3. Heat oil in wok over high heat. Stir-fry onions in the oil until
golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer onions to serving plate. Keep warm.

4. Add about 1/3 of the meat to wok, spreading out slices so they do
not overlap. Cook slices on each side just until lightly browned, 2
to 3 minutes. Remove meat from pan and arrange over onion slices.
Repeat twice to cook remaining meat.
