Title: STEAK AU POIVRE ***XGMF35B
Categories: Main dish, Beef, French
Yield: 2 Servings
1 x  Peppercorns ; handfull
1/4 c  Butter
1 ts Worchestire
1 1/2 tb Mustard
2 tb Lemon juice
2 oz Brandy
Press the steak into the crushed peppercorns, working it into both
sides of the meat. Brown the meat on both sides, in an uncovered pan
on high heat. Reduce the heat and cook to desired temperature, then
remove and hold warm while preparing the sauce. In the same pan melt
the butter with the remaining ingredients, excluding the brandy. when
all ingredients are combined and bubbling add the steak. Now you have
two options, first increase the heat and continue to cook the
mixture, add the brandy and flambe. Reduce and serve warmed or you
can remove meat after flambing, reduce heat a little, add half and
half, reduce mixture again and pour over steak. Both are excellant,
it just depends if you want a cream sauce or a simple reduction. Hope
you enjoy it! FROM: CINDY TICHY
