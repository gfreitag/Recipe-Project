Title: SWEET HOMINY CHIMICHANGAS WITH FRUIT PUREES
Categories: Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  White hominy (about one 29
-ounce can); drained
4 ts Confectioners' sugar
2 tb Heavy (whipping) cream
1 pt Ripe strawberries; hulled
-(1 basket)
2    Ripe mangos
4 tb Butter
2 tb Dark brown sugar
6    Flour tortillas
1.  In a food processor, blender, or food mill, puree the hominy.
Stir in the confectioners' sugar and cream. Place about 1/3 cup of
the hominy mixture in the center of a flour tortilla. Fold up
envelope style.

2.  Wash out the food processor or other machine and puree the
strawberries.  Clean the machine again.

3.  Peel the mangos; remove the pulp from the pits. Puree the pulp.

4.  When ready to serve, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter with 1
tablespoon of the brown sugar in a large frying pan set over medium
heat. Heat until the butter foams and the sugar melts, stirring to
blend. Add 2 or 3 of the filled tortillas, depending on the size of
the pan, and fry for 1 minute. Turn and fry on the other side until
golden and slightly crisp, about 1 minute more.  Remove to a platter.
Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon brown sugar.
Continue cooking until all the chimichangas are done.

5.  Spoon strawberry puree over one end of each chimichanga; spoon
mango puree over the other.  Eat while still warm and crunchy.

Variations:  Other than strawberries and mangos, you can use apricots;
berries (boysenberry, blueberry, raspberry, mulberry); cherries;
guavas; mandarin oranges or other oranges and tangerines; pineapple;
and peaches. Fruits that are mellow (pear, apple, papaya) don't
provide the needed contrast.  The fruit puree can be embellished with
a dash of: brandy, cassis, grenadine, kirsch and Triple Sec.
