2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Water
2 tb Cornstarch

To prepare the Sweet 'N' Sour sauce, combine sugar, vinegar, and soy
sauce; bring to a boil.  Add tomato, onion, pepper and pineapple.
Combine the cornstarch and water and then add to the vegetable
mixture. Cook until thickened, stirring constantly.  Add one
tablespoon of salad oil. Makes about 4 cups

Place the fillets on a raised rack in a well-greased baking dish.
Spread butter over the trout and cover the pan. Bake at 350 for 20
minutes. Carefully remove fillets. Remove the rack from the pan and
discard the drippings.  Return the fillets to the pan without the
rack. Pour 2 cups of sauce over the fish and return to the oven,
uncovered, for an additional 30 minutes.

Serve fillets on a platter of salad greens, covered with the remaining
sauce, steaming white rice, broccoli in lemon juice, and fresh Italian
bread.

Serves 4.
