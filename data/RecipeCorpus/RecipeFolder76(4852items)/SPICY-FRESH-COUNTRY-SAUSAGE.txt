Title: SPICY FRESH COUNTRY SAUSAGE
Categories: Pork/ham
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Pork butt
3/4    -1 lb.
4 ts Kosher salt (or use canning
Salt)
2 ts Coarsely ground black
Pepper
2 ts Dried sage (ugh, you don't
Have to use this!)
1 ts Dried thyme
2 ts Sugar
1 tb Red pepper flakes
1 ts Cayenne
1/2 c  Water
md Hog casings (optional)
Pork back fat
Put the meat and fat through the meat grinder, using the 1/4-inch
plate, (or use food processor). In a large bowl, mix the ground pork,
fat, spices, herbs, and water, kneading and squeezing the meat until
everything is nicely blended. If you are making the sausage for
patties, simply wrap it in bulk and refrigerate (or freeze) it. Or
stuff the seasoned meat into medium hog casings and tie into 4-inch
links. Fresh sausage will keep for 3 days in the refrigerator, frozen
for up to 2 months.

This recipe gives the basics of sausage making and can be varied. You
can mix in one or more herbs like marjoram, summer savory, or dried
rosemary along with a spice like nutmeg, cloves, allspice, or ginger.
A good rule of thumb is to add 1/2 tsp. of a dried herb and/or a
pinch of spice to the basic recipe. Two tsp. of minced garlic can
also be added. Fry up a small patty to test and taste, and mix in
more flavor as you go.

Southern farm wives used to stuff bulk sausage into small muslin bags
or 'pokes', or fry patties and layer them in their own fat for
preservation over the winter. The modern alternative is freezing.
