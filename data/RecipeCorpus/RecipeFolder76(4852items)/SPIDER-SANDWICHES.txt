MMMMM------------------------INFORMATION-----------------------------
Spider sandwiches: Take bread and put peanut butter on each slice and
cut into a circle. On top place two raisins for eyes and if you want
a nose you can use a raisin for that also. Licorice for whiskers
(black or chocolate) for legs use cheetos for the 8 legs and there
you go a nice treat before trick or treat.
