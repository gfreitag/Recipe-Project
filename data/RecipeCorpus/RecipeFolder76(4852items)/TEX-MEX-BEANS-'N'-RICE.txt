Title: TEX-MEX BEANS 'N' RICE
Categories: Low, Fat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 md Onion, chopped
1    Green bell pepper, chopped
1    Red bell pepper, chopped,
1 sm Can green chiles, chopped
1 cn Black beans
1 cn Garbanzo beans (chickpeas)
Cumin
Cayenne
"Saute" the onion in a little water, until it has browned slightly (I
tend to brown it, then add the water to un-stick it from the bottom
of the pan). Add in the peppers, one type at a time; heat through.
Drain the beans, reserving a little of the liquid (not a lot -- it's
pretty salty), rinse the beans and add them to the pot. Add in some
of the bean liquid and some water, until it's  somewhat soupy.  Heat
thoroughly. Before it's done, add cumin and cayenne to taste (we like
LOTS of cumin, and a touch of cayenne for a bit of byte).

While this was all cooking, you should also have a pot of rice on to
cook. Serve the resulting bean concoction over the rice.
