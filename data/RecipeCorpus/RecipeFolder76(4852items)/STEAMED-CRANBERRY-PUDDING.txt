Categories: Holiday, Desserts
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  Cranberries
-chopped
3/4 c  Walnuts
-chopped
1/2 c  Dried apricots
-chopped
2 c  Flour
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1 c  Bread crumbs
-fine dry
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Chopped cuet
2    Egg
2/3 c  Milk
1 ts Almond extract
Grease two 1 quart moulds and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Combine
the cranberries, walnuts and apricots and dredge with 1/4 cup of the
flour. Sift the remaining flour, baking powder and salt together.
Combine with the bread crumbs. Beat together the brown sugar, suet
and eggs. Add the dry ingredients alternately with the milk to the
suet mixure. Stir in the almond extract and the floured fruit and
walnuts, combining well. Turn the batter into the prepared moulds.
The moulds should be no more than three-quarters full. Cover with a
double thickness of wax paper and foil and tie securely with string.
Place on a rack in a large pot. Pour boiling water around the moulds
to two-thirds of the way up the moulds. Cover tightly and steam for 2
to 2 1/2 hours, or until the top of the pudding is no longer sticky.
Add more boiling water if necessary during this time, but make sure
the water just simmers in the pan as the pudding steams. Remove the
moulds from the water. Let the pudding set in the moulds for about 5
minutes, then turn out onto a warm platter and serve hot with Caramel
Sauce, Almond Sauce or Hard Sauce. If you are using Hard Sauce, try
substituting 2 tbls. apricot brandy for the flavouring. Yield 12
servings.
