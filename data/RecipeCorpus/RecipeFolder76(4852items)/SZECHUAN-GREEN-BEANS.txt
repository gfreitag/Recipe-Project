2    Quarter-sized slices ginger

Peel garlic and ginger.  Smash garlic.  Trim scallions and cut into 2"
lengths (don't be fancy, the next step is a food processor). Place
garlic, ginger, and scallions into a food processor and process until
finely chopped.  Remove to a 14x11x2" dish.  Add oil and pepper
flakes. Cook in microwave, uncovered, at 100% for 3 minutes. Remove
from microwave and stir in remaining ingredients, tossing gently to
coat green beans. Cook, uncovered, at 100% for 10-15 minutes,
stirring 4-5 times. Serve hot or cold.
