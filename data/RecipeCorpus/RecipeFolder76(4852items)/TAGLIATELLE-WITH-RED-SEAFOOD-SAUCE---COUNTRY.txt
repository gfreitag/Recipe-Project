thyme, red pepper, and 1/4 t salt; cook 2 minutes. Add shrimp and cod
to skillet-saute with slotted spoon until shrimp and cod are almost
cooked through-about 3 minutes. Cut calamari crosswise into
1/2-inch-thick rings; add to seafood mixture and cook 1 minute (do
not overcook as calamari will toughen). Remove seafood to large bowl
or plate; cover to keep wann and set aside. 2. Add remaining 3 T oil
to skillet. Stir in tomatoes with their juice, the wine, sugar, and
remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt to skillet to make sauce; cover and
simmer 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cook tagliatelle following package
directions. Uncover sauce and cook 5 minutes longer. Remove from heat
and gently stir in reserved seafood. 3. If desired, just before
serving, steam mussels until they open. Discard any which don't open.
To serve, transfer cooked pasta to serving platter, top with sauce
and seafood mixture and toss until well combined. Garnish platter
with mussels and fresh thyme sprig, if desired. Note: Grippa Brand
