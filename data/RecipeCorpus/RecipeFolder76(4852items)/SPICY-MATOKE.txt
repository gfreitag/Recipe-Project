Title: SPICY MATOKE
Categories: Main dish, African
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 lb Beef chuck, cut into
1/4 c  Water
4    Medium green plantains, or
1 1/2-inch pieces
Small green (unripe) banana
1/2 ts Salt
Peeled and cut into 1/2-inc
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1    Small onion, coarsley
Chopped
1    Fresh hot chile pepper, such
As jalapeno, seeded and
Chopped
1 ts Curry powder
1 ts Ground coriander seed
Thick slices
3 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 c  Well-washed chopped spinach
Leaves (about 5 ounces)
2 tb Unsalted buter, softened
1/2 c  Freshly grated coconut
(optional)
In a 5-quart Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat.
Sprinkle the beef with the salt and pepper. In batches, add the beef
and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 8 to 10
minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the browned beef to a plate
and set it aside.
Add the onion and chile pepper to the Dutch oven. Reduce the heat
to medium and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened,
about 3 minutes. Add the curry powder and coriander, and stir for 1
minute. Return the beef to the Dutch oven, and stir in the water.
Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, until the meat is tender
and the liquid has almost com- pletely evaporated, about 1 hour. (If
the stew looks as if it's drying out, add a little more water.)
Preheat the oven to 350. Lightly butter a 9-inch square baking
dish.
In a large bowl, combine the plantains and spinach, and mash
together with a fork until fairly smooth. Stir in the beef stew.
Spread the mixture evenly in the prepared baking dish, and dot the
top with the butter.
Bake until the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle
with the grated coconut if desired, and serve immediately.
