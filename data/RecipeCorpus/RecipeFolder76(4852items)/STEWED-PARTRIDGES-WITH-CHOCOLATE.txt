Stephen Ceideburg
2    Partridges, trussed
1    Onion, coarsely chopped
1    Head garlic, skinned
3    Or 4 whole cloves
1    Bay leaf
1 c  Dry white wine
1 tb Sherry wine vinegar
Salt, pepper
1 oz Semisweet chocolate, grated
Fried potato slices
From "The Gastronomy of Spain and Portugal," by Maite Manjon.

Put the birds in a casserole with all remaining ingredients except the
chocolate and potato slices, inserting the whole cloves into the head
of garlic. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes to an
hour, shaking the casserole at intervals and adding a little more
wine, if necessary.

Remove the partridges and place on a heated serving platter. Add the
chocolate to the contents of the casserole, cook for 5 minutes, then
rub the sauce through a sieve with a wooden spoon or process in a
blender or food processor.

Arrange the slices of fried potato around the birds, then pour on the
sauce so that it completely covers the birds.
