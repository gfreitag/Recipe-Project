Heat oil in large, deep skillet or Dutch oven. Add garlic and onion.
Cook gently until tender and fragrant, but do not brown.

Add red peppers, and jalapenos.  Cook for 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in
corn and mix together well.  Add stock and bring to a boil. Cook
gently for 5 minutes. Stir in spinach and cook for 5 minutes longer,
just until wilted. Add pepper, salt, if desired and basil. Taste and

the garlic and onion.  I substituted the chicken broth.
