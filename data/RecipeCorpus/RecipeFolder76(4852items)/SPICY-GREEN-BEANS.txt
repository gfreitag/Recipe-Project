Title: SPICY GREEN BEANS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Fresh green beans
1    In cube peeled chopped ginge
10    Whole cloves garlic
1 1/2 c  Water
5 tb Vegetable oil
2 ts Whole cumin seeds
1    Dried hot red chili
2 ts Ground coriander
1 1/4 ts Salt
3 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Ground roasted cumin
Trim  the green beans and cut them crosswise at 1/4 in intervals. Put
the ginger and garlic into the container of an electric blender or
food processor. Add 1/3 of the water and blend until fairly smooth.
Heat the oil in a wide,  heavy saucepan over a medium flame. When
hot, put in the cumin seeds.   Five seconds later, put in the crushed
chili. As soon as it darkens,  pour in the ginger-garlic paste.
Stir and cook for about a minute.   Put in the coriander.
Stir a few times.  Now put in the chopped tomatoes.
Stir and cook for about 2 minutes, mashing up the tomato pieces with
the back of a slotted spoon as you do so. Put in the beans, salt and
the remaining water. Bring to simmer. Cover, turn heat to low and
cook for about 8-10 minutes or until  the  beans  are tender. Remove
the cover. Add the lemon juice, roasted cumin, and a generous amount
of freshly ground pepper.   Turn heat up and boil away all of the
liquid, stirring the beans gently as you do so.
