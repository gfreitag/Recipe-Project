If fillets are thicker than 1/2 to 5/8 inch, carefully cut in
half horizontally (as you would an English muffin). Trim each into a
neat 4-inch square.

Cut off tops and bottoms of peppers to leave a band about 2
inches wide; remove seeds and ribs.  Cut two 4-inch long rectangular
pieces from each.  Cut into 1/8-inch julienne, leaving pieces grouped
in a neat rectangle.  Place salmon on an oiled steamer tray or plate.
Use a cleaver or knife blade to transfer pepper rectangles to fish,
completely covering each fillet.

Scatter bamboo shoots over the fish, then sprinkle with black
beans, ginger and scallions.  In small bowl, stir together soy sauce,
chicken stock, white pepper, vegetable oil and sesame oil. Pour
mixture over.

Steam in covered steamer (making sure that water boils steadily
but does not boil away) until just cooked through and opaque, 5 to 8
minutes (timing varies according to thickness of fish). Carefully
transfer to serving plate, spoon sauce around and serve immediately.
