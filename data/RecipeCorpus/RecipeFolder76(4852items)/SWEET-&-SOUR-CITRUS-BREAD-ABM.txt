Title: SWEET & SOUR CITRUS BREAD ABM
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Ounces
MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
1 3/4 ts Yeast
3 c  Bread flour
3 tb Wheat germ
3 tb Wheat bran
1/3 c  Sugar
1/2 tb Salt
2 ts Orange peel, grated
1 1/2 ts Lemon peel, grated
1    Eggs
3 tb Butter
3/4 c  Sourdough starter
3/4 c  Water; warm
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

The sweet and tart citrus flavor of this loaf complements chicken,
turkey, and cold roast pork. Toast made from this moist, dense bread
has a clear flavor that should not be masked by anything more
overbearing than a slim coating of butter or cottage cheese.
