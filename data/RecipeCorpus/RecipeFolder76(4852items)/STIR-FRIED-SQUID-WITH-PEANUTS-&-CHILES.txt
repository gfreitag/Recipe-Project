1/4 c  Raw peanuts, roughly chopped

1    Or more fresh chile

In traditional Chinese cooking, dishes which are part of a banquet-
style meal usually contain about 1 pound of food. This dish will
serve 4 if there are 3 other dishes besides soup; 6 if there are 6
other dishes, etc.

Saute garlic and chile peppers in half the oil over low heat in a wok
or heavy frying pan until garlic is lightly browned. Add peanuts for
the last 30 seconds. Stir continuously.

Remove ingredients from the pan, add more oil, if necessary, and the
squid. Cook for 30 seconds.  Return peanuts, garlic and chiles to
pan. Immediately add all but 1 Tb of the stock, soy sauce and
cilantro.

Continue stir-frying for another minute.  Add cornstarch mixture. When
sauce thickens, remove from heat and serve.

[Score squid diagonally at three quarter inch intervals. Turn and
repeat at right angles to original cuts. Don't cut all the way
through the squid body.  Cut each scored squid body into three or
four pieces.

When cooked, the squid will roll up and the crosshatching will catch
and hold the sauce.  It's much easier to do than to describe. S.C.]
