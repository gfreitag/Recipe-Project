Categories: Salads, Misc
Yield: 8 Servings
1 lg Can pineapple chunks
2 c  Miniature marshmellows
1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb Flour
1/2 tb White vinegar
1    Egg beaten
2 1/2 c  Diced unpeeled apples
2 1/2 c  Spanish salted peanuts
1    8 0z. cool whip
Drain pineapple and save juice, combine marshmellows and pineapple and
refrigerate over night. In saucepan combine juice, flour, sugar,
vinegar and egg.Cook over low heat until it starts to thicken. Chill
overnight. Next day mix cool whip and sauce and then add the
pineapple marsh- mellow mixture and apples and peanuts then
refrigerate. P.S. I have made this and added cherries instead of
apples and peanuts. Very nice dessert or as a salad.
