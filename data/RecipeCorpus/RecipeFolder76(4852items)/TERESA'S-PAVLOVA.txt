Title: TERESA'S PAVLOVA
Categories: Desserts, Low-cal, Low-fat, Microwave
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ea Egg white, room temperature
2 ts Granulated sugar
1 ea Serving Non-stick Spray(Pam)
1 ts Powdered sugar, divided
1/8 ts White vinegar
1/8 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Fresh strawberries or kiwi
1 tb Whipped topping
Use a shallow rectangular baking dish, approximately 6 by 8 inches.
Spray with non-stick butter flavored cooking spray. Line with wax
paper cut to fit.  Spray again with Pam, dust lightly with 1/2 of the
powdered sugar. Set aside.  Whip egg white until firm peaks form. Add
sugar, vinegar and vanilla and whip until stiff peaks form, about 30
seconds to 1 minute more. Spread evenly in baking dish, and cook in
microwave oven for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on high. The meringue will
stretch and spread while baking, but will shrink back to proper size
while cooling, so don't panic! Cool meringue, and turn out onto wax
paper that has been lightly dusted with the remaining powdered sugar.
Spread with the tablespoon of whipped topping, top with the fruit and
gently roll up. Garnish with small piece of fruit and mint leaves.
