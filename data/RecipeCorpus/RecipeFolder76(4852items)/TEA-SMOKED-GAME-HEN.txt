Categories: Chinese, Game hens, Poultry
Yield: 3 Servings
1 1/2 lb Game hen
Salt; to taste
Freshly ground black -
Pepper; to taste
2 tb Chinese rice wine OR
Dry sherry
2 tb Sesame oil
3 tb Jasmine tea leaves
4 tb Alder or hickory sawdust
6 c  Peanut oil; for deep-frying
Cut the bird in half, using poultry shears or a Chinese cleaver.
Rub the halves with salt and pepper, wine and sesame oil. Allow to
marinate for 2 hours.
Dip the halves into boiling water for 1 minute. Remove and place
on a rack for drying.
Smoke the halves in a Cameron stove-top smoker for 15 minutes,
using the tea leaves and the alder or hickory sawdust.
Place the halves on a plate and steam in a bamboo steamer for 20
minutes.  Allow the pieces to cook, then deep-fry in hot peanut oil
at 375 degrees until golden brown and crispy, about 4 to 5 minutes.
This recipe serves 3 to 4 as part of a Chinese meal.

Comments:  The game hen is a relatively recent bird, a development
of modern agricultural science. However, in old China similar birds
were common and this method of cooking remains a classic.
