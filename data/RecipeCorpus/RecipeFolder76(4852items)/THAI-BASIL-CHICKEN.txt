Categories: Poultry, Thai
Yield: 4 Servings
JUDI M. PHELPS (BNVX05A)
1/4 lb Green beans
1 tb Chopped ginger
1/4 lb Yellow summer squash
4    Hot chili peppers *
1 lg Carrot
1/4 c  Soy sauce (sodium reduced)
1    Sweet yellow pepper

3    Hot chili peppers*
1/3 c  Oil
3 tb Chopped fresh basil
1 lb Boneless chicken breasts
Chili oil (optional)
1 tb Oil
*When handling hot peppers, use plastic gloves as oils are very hot
and can burn eyes. PREPARATION: For marinade, chop ginger and hot
peppers and combine in a glass dish with soy sauce, sherry and oil.
Cut chicken into 1-inch cubes and put in marinade. Cover with plastic
wrap and chill at least 4 hours. Trim beans and cut into 1-1/2-inch
lengths. Cut squash and carrot into 1/8-inch diagonal slices. Seed
yellow pepper and slice into thin strips. Seed and chop hot peppers.
COOKING: Heat wok over high heat with the 1 tablespoon oil. While
heating, remove chicken cubes from marinade. Strain marinade and
reserve liquid. Add chicken to wok. Stir fry over medium high heat
until chicken is almost done about 3 minutes. Remove from work and
set aside. Add beans, sliced carrot, and marinade to wok. Cook about
2 minutes, stirring, and then add squash and peppers. Continue
cooking 2 minutes more. Turn off heat. Return chicken to wok and
toss. Chop and add basil and season with chili oil if desired.
