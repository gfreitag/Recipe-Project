Title: THAI CORN BLACK BEAN SALAD
Categories: Salads, Side dish, Vegetables, Thai
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Corn kernels, cooked
2 c  Black beans, cooked
1/2 c  Celery, sliced
1/2 c  Red onion, diced
1/2 c  Red bell pepper, diced
1/4 c  Cilantro, chopped
2 ea Jalapeno chiles, seeded &
-- minced
2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
1 ts Ginger, minced
3 tb Sesame oil
2 tb Rice vinegar
1 tb Lime juice
Salt, to taste
In a large bowl, combine corn, beans, celery, onion, pepper, cilantro,
chiles, garlic & ginger.  Set aside.

In another bowl, whisk together oil, vinegar & lime juice. Pour over
the ingredients in the large bowl & mix well. Season with salt &
chill until ready to serve.

MARK'S NOTE: I am not sure what makes this "Thai", however the taste
is not bad.  I especially like using black beans in contrast with
other bright colours.  I used galangal in place of ginger in this
recipe plus a pinch of lemongrass.  I replaced the red onion with a
couple of large green onions, chopped.

Next time, I'll use red chiles rather than jalapeno chiles.
Jalapenoes, especially when seeded, do not have much taste. A couple
of red chiles, finely minced should go a long way towards perking up
an otherwise promising dish.  Oh yes, do increase the lime juice. I
used as much juice as I could squeeze out of half a large lime & it
could have still used more, so 1 tb is not nearly enough.  Try
garnishing with kaffir lime leaves as well.
