Title: SPICY BEER BATTER
Categories:
Yield: 10 Servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Ground cayenne pepper - or
More
1 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Salt
8 oz Light beer
Vegetable oil
Sift all the dry ingredients together in a large mixing bowl. Just
before you are ready to fry the food, add the beer and mix well but
do not beat. Dip the pieces of food to be fried into the batter one
at a time. Heat enough vegetable oil to cover the food pieces in a
deep skillet over high heat until a little sample of the batter
sizzles. Lower the food into the oil a few pieces at a time-too many
at one time will lower the temperature below the optimum for
frying-and cook until golden on all sides turning as necessary.
Remove the food from the fat with a slotted spoon or pancake turner
and drain on paper toweling. Serve at once. Typos by Brenda Adams

Jean Andrews.  She says, "This batter is a delightful light, puffy
coating for fish, chili rellenos, shrimp, or anything that needs to
be batter-fried. I like it better than ternpura batter."
