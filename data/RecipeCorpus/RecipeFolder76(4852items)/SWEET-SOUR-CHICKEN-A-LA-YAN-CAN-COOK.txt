1/4 c  Cornstarch

Lots of oil for frying

1/4 c  Chicken broth
1/4 c  Dark brown sugar, packed

2 ts Soy sauce
1/2 ts Orange peel, grated

1 cn 8 oz pineapple chunks
1 cn 8 to 11 oz lychee or
Mandarin orange, drained
Thickener:
1 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Water, cold
Mix chicken, sherry, soy, and salt. Let sit for at least 30 min. Mix
in beaten egg. Combine cornstarch and flour (this makes a coating that
approximates water chestnut flour). Dredge chicken cubes in flour,
shaking off excess. Let rest for a few minutes. Deep fry in hot oil
(360) for 2 (for white meat) to 3 (for dark meat) min. Drain on paper
towels and keep warm.

Saute ginger and garlic in oil over high heat. Add rest of sauce
ingredients. Add peppers and stir-cook for 1 min. Add pineapple and
lychee/orange. Raise heat to high high. Mix cornstarch with water and
mix in. Taste now for seasoning - if it needs a little sugar,
vinegar, or salt, add that now. When sauce thickens and turns glossy,
it is ready.

MEANWHILE, reheat the kettle of oil to high (375) and refry the
chicken for 2 min or until it's golden and crispy on the outside.

Add chicken to sauce and vegetables, toss, and serve with white rice.
