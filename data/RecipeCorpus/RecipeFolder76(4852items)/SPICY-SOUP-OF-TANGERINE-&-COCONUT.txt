Categories: Soups, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Water
1 c  Long-grain white rice
1 cn (14oz) coconut milk
1 c  Vegetable stock
1/2 c  Tangerine juice
(about 2 1/2 tangerines)
1 tb Tangerine zest,
Finely grated
(about 2 tangerines)
1 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Thai chili paste
2 ea Thai chili peppers
-- or serrano chilies
-- stemmed and seeded
2 c  Mushrooms, quartered
1/2 c  Wood ear mushrooms, chopped
1/2 c  Basil, chopped
Salt and pepper
In a saucepan, bring the water to a full boil. Add the rice and boil
for 5 min. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until tender and
the water is absorbed, about 20 min.

Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, combine the coconut milk, chicken
stock, tangerine juice and zest, fish sauce, chili paste, and chili
peppers. Bring to a full boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer
for about 5 min. The stock will be slightly foamy and will have
turned a golden-orange color. Add the mushrooms and wood ears, and
cook until the mushrooms are tender but not mushy, about 5 min, but
no more than 10 min. Remove from the heat and stir in the basil.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.

To serve, divide the rice among 6 individual bowls and spoon the soup
over the top. Serve immediately.

Note: experiment with adding other ingredients, such as shrimp or
fresh artichoke hearts.
