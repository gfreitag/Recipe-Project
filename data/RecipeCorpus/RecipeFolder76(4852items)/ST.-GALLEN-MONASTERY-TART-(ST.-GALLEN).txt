The Story:

It was an Irish monk who established the monastery of St. Gallen in
AD 613 and the town developed around it. The ruling of the monastery
had a great influence over the lives of the surrounding community,
which did not gain its independence until the 14th Century. Although
the townsfolk and countryfolk sometimes suffered under their monastic
rulers, they also inherited certain advantages, one of which is shown
in this recipe. This proves that it is not just a legend that monks
enjoyed good food.

The recipe:

Cream the butter and sugar.

Mix the almonds, cocoa, cinnamon, flour and baking powder together.

Add the milk, beaten egg white and dry ingredients to the creamed
butter mixture.

Work these together quickly until a soft dough is formed, leaving the
sides of the bowl clean.

Cover and leave in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Line a buttered flan ring or tin with 3/4 of the dough. Cover the
bottom with jam.

Use the remaining dough to make strips, then criss-cross lattice
fashion over the tart. Brush with beaten egg yolk.

Bake for 45 minutes at 180 oC.

Serve cold.
