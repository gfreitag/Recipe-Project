Title: STRAWBERRY TORTE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Recipe
6    Egg whites (cold)
2 c  Granulated white sugar
1 1/2 ts White vinegar
1 pt Heavy cream
1 ts Vanilla
1 pk Plain gelatin
2 tb Warm water
2 pt Stawberries
Beat egg whites until foamy. Add sugar and vinegar alternately very
slowly. When stiff, pour into a 9" spring form pan, which has been
HEAVILY GREASED. Coat sides and bottom of pan to form a shell of the
meringue. Bake at 275 degrees for 1 hour without peeking (don't open
oven door). Open the oven after the hour is up and leave for another
1 1/2 hours with heat off. Cool completely.  Soften gelatin in warm
water for a few minutes and when completely cool, whip the cream, add
gelatin mixture, vanilla and a little sugar if desired. Take out
about 8 big stawberries for decoration and slice the rest. Fold
sliced stawberries into the whipped cream. Skim off the hard top of
the center of the meringue. Fill shell with the strawberry mixture.
Crumble the hard top extra meringue on top and decorate with whole
strawberries.  Chill at least
6    hours.  Wow!
