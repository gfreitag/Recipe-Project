Categories: Chinese
Yield: 2 Dozen
1 c  Unsifted all purpose flour
1 c  Plus 2 tablespoons water
Blend water and flour until smooth.  Let stand 15 minutes. Heat a wide
frying pan or griddle with a nonstick finish over medium heat. Using
a wide pastry brush or new, wide paint brush, brush on a thin layer
of batter in approximately a 6-inch square.  If holes appear, brush
over some more batter in the opposite direction. As soon as the
batter appears dry and the edges being to curl (about 15 seconds),
lift wrapper from pan and cool (do not stack).  Repeat until all
batter is used. Fill at once, or separate with pieces of wax paper,
cover tightly and refrigerate for as long as 1 day.  Makes about two
dozen.
