MMMMM-------------------HAVE READY TO PREPARE------------------------
5 lg To 6 Garlic cloves, cleaned
Ginger root (fresh)
4 lg To 5 lg Bell Peppers,*
3 lg To 4 lg Tomatoes,**
* Green or Red, cored and rinsed of seeds ** cored and the insides
spooned out into bowl 3. PREPARATION: In a large frying pan, heat pan
and add olive oil. Press 2 cloves of garlic into oil, and stir. When
it begins to cook, add Bowl #2 (carrots). Stir carefully, and when it
stops spitting, add Bowl #1. Add soy to taste to mixture and toss.
Let cook until onions start to clarify, stirring frequently. Add the
fresh tomato bowl (Bowl #3) and stir until tomatoes are tender. Add
the cooked tomatoes and juice, and stir in well. While cooking, grate
the ginger, add the remaining garlic (crushed). When mixture begins
to dry, add the spaghetti sauce, a dash of nutmeg, a dash of five
spice powder, pepper, and the taco sauce mixture. Stir in the powder
well. Let the sauce cool for a few minutes on simmer, and taste. Add
crushed red peppers to desired taste, but sauce should be hot. I used
about a 1/2 tsp. Add enough water to make it mix well, and add the
meat (Bowl #4). Reduce until semi-thick while stirring (or it will
stick) Let it cool for a few moments. Mix equal amounts of rice and
sauce in a bowl, about 3 Tbsp for each item to be stuffed. Stuff the
tomatoes and peppers carefully, trying to fill all gaps. Arrange on
pan that fits them, and bake at 350 degrees for about a half hour. Be
careful to fill them completely, but not overfill, the idea being
that they should not leak any of the sauce. When done, the skins will
be wrinkled and lighter in color, but still have some crunch. Serve
with extra unused sauce as a toping. The baked sauce will be far less
spicy than the origional sauce. Sauce can also be served over rice.
