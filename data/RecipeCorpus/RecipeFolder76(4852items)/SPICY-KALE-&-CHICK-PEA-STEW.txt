Chickpeas should be soaked overnight in enough water to cover them by
4 inches, drained, and rinsed. In a large saucepan simmer the
chickpeas in the water, covered partially, for 1 1/2 hours, or until
they are tender. In a heavy kettle cook the onions and the garlic in
the oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the
vegetables are golden, add the bell peppers, and cook the mixture,
stirring, for 10 minutes. Add the chick-peas with the cooking liquid,
the kale, the tomatoes with the juice, the tomato paste, the chili
powder, the thyme, the oregano, the red pepper flakes, the cumin, the
sugar, and the bay leaf, bring the liquid to a boil, and simmer the
stew, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Discard the bay leaf, season
the stew with salt, and serve the stew on the couscous or rice. Makes
about 14 cups, serving 8 to 10.
