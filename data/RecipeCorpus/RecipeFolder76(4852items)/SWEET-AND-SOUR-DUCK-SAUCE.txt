Title: SWEET-AND-SOUR DUCK SAUCE
Categories: Canning, Condiments, Fruits, Harned 1994, Sauces
Yield: 1 Batch
3 lb Firm, ripe red plums*
-- pitted, in 1/2" chunks
1/2 ts Peeled, crushed garlic
1/2 lb Onions; peeled
-- finely chopped**
1 c  Rice wine or cider vinegar
1/2 ts Dried crushed red pepper
1 ts Ground coriander
1/2 ts Ground allspice
2 1/2 c  Sugar
*Should yield about 2 quarts.  **Should yield about 1 cup.

Place all ingredients except the sugar in a wide 4-quart saucepan and
bring to boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Boil steadily
for about 30 minutes.

Remove from heat, put through food mill, and return pureed fruit to
pan. Add sugar, place over medium heat, and stir constantly until
mixture again boils. Boil steadily about 30 minutes, stirring often
to prevent sticking; continue boiling about 15 minutes more, stirring
constantly. Sauce is done when about 1/2 tsp. of it holds its shape
on a chilled saucer. Spoon at once into hot, sterilized half-pint
jars and seal. Store at least a week to mellow.

Yield: About 5 1/2 cups.

Lesem writes that her version is "...a fine dipping sauce not just for
roast duck, but also barbecued spareribs. I also like to mix it with
oil and vinegar to glaze spareribs or duckling during the last 20 to
30 minutes of roasting or grilling."
