Categories: Cookies, Pies & past
Yield: 30 Servings
2 oz Emisweet Chocolate Chips
1/2 c  Softened Salted Butter
1 c  White Sugar
2 lg Eggs
2 ts Pure Vanilla Extract
1 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour
1/2 ts Baking Soda
6 oz Semisweet Chocolate Chips
3 oz White Chocolate Chips
1 1/2 oz Milk Chocolate Chips
Preheat oven to 375 F.  Line cookie sheets with waxed paper.

In a double boiler melt the unsweetened chocolate and the first batch
of chocolate chips.  Stir frequently with wooden spoon or wire whisk
until creamy and smooth.

Pour melted chocolate into a large bowl.  Add butter and beat with
electric mixer at medium speed until thoroughly combined. Add the
sugar, eggs and vanilla. Beat on medium speed until well blended.
Scrape down sides of bowl.

Add the flour, baking soda and the three types of chocolate chips.
Mix at low speed just until combined. Chips should be distributed
equally throughout the dough.

Roll a heaping tablespoon of dough into a ball, about 1 1/2 inches in
diameter.  Place dough balls onto paper-lined pans, 2 inches apart.
With the palm of your hand, flatten each ball to 1/2 inch thickness.

Bake for 10-12 minutes.  Transfer cookies with a spatula to a cool,
flat surface.
