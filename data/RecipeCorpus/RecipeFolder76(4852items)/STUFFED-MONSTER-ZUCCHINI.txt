This is of general interest, so I'll post it.  I, too, was recently
given a giant zucchini, big enough to effectively bludgeon someone.
(ironically enough, I got it in a butcher shop my dad dragged me in
to.) I sliced it in half horizontally, scooped out the seeds, and
stuffed it with cooked rice and lentils and baked it. Put some
lentils in a pot with water and boil them until barely soft.  Throw
in some rice and cook until barely done, using as little water as
possible. Meanwhile, sautee some celery, onion and garlic (not too
much garlic.) and add that to the rice and lentils, along with some
ground cumin and thyme. Throw it on the zucchini and bake at around
350 or 400 until the zucchini is soft. The surface of the stuffing
will probably get burned and dried out, but you van just brush it
aside.
