Title: SUN-DRIED SALTY FISH - PLA KEM *
Categories: Thai, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Mackerel
3 tb Salt
1/2 c  Water
One day of bright sunlight is an essential part of this recipe. This
method of food preservation is particularly suitable for fish of all
types, although mackerel is a favorite.
~------------------------------------------------------
~----------------- Remove only the entrails and rinse the fish until
clean. Dissolve the salt in the water and soak the fish overnight in
the salt solution. The next day, hang the fish in bright sunlight and
allow to dry for at least one whole day.  Alternatively, bake the
fish at 325Ã¸F for 45 minutes.

Seafood dried by this method keeps indefinitely, and can be used in
other recipes, such as fried sun-dried fish (Pla Kem Taud).
