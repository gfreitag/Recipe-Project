Categories: Appetizers, Salad/dress, Low fat, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
6    Navel oranges -- chilled
4 c  Spinach -- trimmed
1 1/2 c  Watercress
1 tb Pine nuts
1/3 c  Shallot -- minced
2    Cloves garlic -- peeled and
Minced
5 tb Balsamic vinegar
2 ts Sherry vinegar

To taste
Peel the oranges and remove the white pith.  Over a bowl positioned to
catch the juice, separate the segments of each orange from the
membrane with a sharp knife, discarding the seeds and set them aside.
Squeeze the residual juice from the membranes into the bowl and
reserve.

Combine the spinach and watercress in a mixing bowl.

Put the pine nuts in a small saute pan and cook them over medium heat
for about 6 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until the nuts are
golden brown. Transfer the pine nuts to a small bowl.

Put the shallots, garlic, vinegars, and reserved orange juice into the
saute pan. Bring to a boil over low heat. Stir int he black pepper
then pour the dressing over the spinach and watercress. Toss to coat.

Arrange the mixture on salad plates, spoon orange segments atop each,
and garnish with the pine nuts, and if you like, orange wheels.
