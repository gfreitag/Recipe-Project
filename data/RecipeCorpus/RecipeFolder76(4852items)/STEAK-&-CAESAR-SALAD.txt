Categories: Main dish, Salads
Yield: 6 Servings
2    Romaine
1    Egg
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
1/4 c  Olive oil
3 tb Lemon juice
1 1/2 tb Red wine vinegar
1/2 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Worcestershire Sauce
1    Clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly cracked black pepper
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 c  Crumbled blue cheese
1 c  Croutons, optional
1 1/2 lb Beefsteak, trimmed,

This is a hearty tasty combination of Caesar salad and steak all in
one. Any tender cut of beef, or leftover pieces of filet can be used.
Trim beef into strips 3/4" to 1 inch thick strips.

Wash romaine leaves, shake and dry well and tear into bite-sized
pieces. (May wrap in layers of paper towels, put in plastic bag and
refrigerate to keep crisp.) Combine next 10 ingredients, whisking
well to blend. Set aside.

When ready to serve, bring steak to room temperature. Put greens in
large salad bowl and add Parmesan cheese, blue cheese and croutons.
Cook steak on hot grill, or pan-fry in heavy skillet on high heat
approximately 4-5 minutes each side, for medium rare. Sprinkle with
salt and pepper after turning once. Slice steak across grain in thin
slices and add to salad. Pour on dressing and any meat juices, toss
and serve immediately. Pass extra Parmesan cheese and a pepper mill.
