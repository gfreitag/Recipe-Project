1    Strip thick hickory-smoked
Bacon
1    Skinless, boneless chicken
Breast, (6 oz)
2 oz Grated monterey jack cheese
1/2 ts Butter
1    Button mushroom, sliced

Place bacon in skillet over low-medium heat and fry until crisp. Cut
into 1/4 inch chunks and set aside. Wash chicken breast under cold
running water and pat dry with a paper towel. Place chicken between
sheets of waxed paper, skinless side up, on a cutting board. Flatten
with a poultry hammer until entire breast is 1/4 inch thick. Turn
breast over and place the cheese and bacon in the center. Melt butter
in small saucepan. Add mushrooms, garlic and soy sauce and saute
until tender. Pour over bacon mixture.  Pull all sides of the breast
up and over the cheese to form a large ball shape, completely
covering all ingredients in the middle of the chicken.  Preheat oil
in deep fryer or small skillet to 350 degrees. In small bowl combine
egg and milk and beat to combine. In small bowl combine flour, salt
and pepper. Dip chicken in egg and milk bath and roll in spiced
flour.  Submerge in hot oil and fry 4-6 minutes or until golden brown.
