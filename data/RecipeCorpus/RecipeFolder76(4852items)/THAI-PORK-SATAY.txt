onto the skewers, weaving in-and-out, sideways, in a ribbon fashion.
Marinate for 30 minutes or longer. Preheat grill. Brush strips with
thick coconut cream. Place (brushed side down) over hot coals for 1

coconut cream and grill until cooked. Serve with Spicy Peanut Sauce

TO PREPARE COCONUT MILK AND CREAM: Pour 1 can unsweetened coconut
milk into a tall glass. Allow to sit for at least 1 hour so the thick
cream rises to the top. Skim off top (cream) and set aside. The rest
is thin coconut milk.
