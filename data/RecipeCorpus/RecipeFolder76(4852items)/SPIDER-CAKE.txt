Yield: 4 Servings  :

Take your average cake mix.  Bake it up in 2 metal bowls--1 bigger
than the other.  One unmolded, cut the bigger one (the "body") in
half, horizontally. CAREFULLY scoop out an adequate cavity in each
half. FILL with well-whipped set green Jello, and reattach the
halves. Frost black, arrange on serving platter. Use licorice stix as
legs. Use 2 BIG green gumdrops and 6 little ones as eyes. When the
cake is cut into, it spurts green goop, just like a real spider when
stepped on
