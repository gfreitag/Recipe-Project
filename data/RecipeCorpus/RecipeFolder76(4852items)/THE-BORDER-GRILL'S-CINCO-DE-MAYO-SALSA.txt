Editor's note: The Border Grill is Milliken's & Feniger's wildly
wonderful restaurant that celebrates the flavors of Mexico. Located
at 1445 4th Street in Santa Monica, CA, many of the recipes that have
made this restaurant so popular appear in the owners' latest book
Mesa Mexicana. For those living in the Los Angeles area, tune into
Mary Sue & Susan's new hit show "Good Food" on KCRW (89.9 FM),
