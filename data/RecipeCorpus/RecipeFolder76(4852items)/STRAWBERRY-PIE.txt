MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3 c  Strawberries, sliced
1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 tb All-purpose flour
Preheat oven to 350F. Combine melted shortening, oats, flour & sugar.
Firmly pack 3/4 of this mixture into an 8" X 8" baking dish. Arrange
the strawberries over the top.  Mix together the sugar & flour &
sprinkle on top of the strawberries. Add the rest of the crumble
mixture & pat down gently. Bake for 30 minutes.  Allow to cool
slightly before serving. Alternately, place in the refrigerator & eat
it chilled. It makes the filling more syrupy in consistency.
