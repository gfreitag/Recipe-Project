Title: STRAWBERRY CREAM CHEESE POUNDCAKE
Categories: Cookies, Desserts, Favorites, Home cookin, Judy's
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 lb Butter -- softened
1/2 lb Cream cheese -- softened
2 c  Sugar
1 pn Salt
2 ts Butter flavoring
6    Eggs -- room temperature
3 c  Sifted flour
1 pt Fresh strawberries --
1    Sliced
Cream the cheese, butter, and sugar together until light and fluffy.
Add a pinch of salt and the butter flavoring, and beat the mixture
well. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each
addition. Stir in the flour. Gradually add the sliced strawberries,
gently folding them in after each addition.

Spoon the batter into a buttered and floured cake pan (I use loaf
pans or those nice little mini-loaf sizes for gift-giving), and bake
the cake in a preheated 325-degree (F) oven for one-and-a-half hours,
until the cake begins to shrink from the sides of the pan.

Place the pans on cooling racks until cooled; turn cakes gently onto
wire racks.
