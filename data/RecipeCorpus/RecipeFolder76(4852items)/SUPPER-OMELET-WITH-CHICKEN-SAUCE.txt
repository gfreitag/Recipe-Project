Beat eggs slightly, beat in milk and seasonings.  Heat butter in
non-stick skillet, pour in omelet mixture and cook slowly. Run
spatula around edge, lifting to allow uncooked portion to flow
underneath. When egg is just cooked but still shiny, loosen edge,
roll or fold one half over. Serve on warm platter with sauce.
