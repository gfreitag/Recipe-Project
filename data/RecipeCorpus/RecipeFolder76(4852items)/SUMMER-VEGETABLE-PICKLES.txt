Return cooking liquid to a boil and boil for 3 minutes. Remove from

Divide vegetables among 3 jars (1 or 2 quart jars work best, but any

enough liquid, add a little white wine vinegar to cover. Allow jars
to cool, cover with lids and refrigerate. Pickles will keep up to a
month in the refrigerator.
