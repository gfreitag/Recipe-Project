Title: THREE CHEESE CHICKEN BAKE
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Lasagna noodles
1/2 c  Onions, chopped
1/2 c  Bell peppers, chopped
10 1/2 oz Soup, cream of chicken
4 oz Mushrooms
1/2 c  Pimientos, chopped
1/2 ts Basil leaves
1 1/2 c  Cheese, cottage
2 c  Chicken; cooked
1/2 c  Cheese, parmesan, grated
For low-fat result, use skim milk, lowfat cottage cheese, and
Campbell's Special Request cream of mushroom soup. Turkey may be
substituted for chicken.

Preheat oven to 350.  Cube chicken. Cook noodles for about 10 minutes
in spaghetti blancher or large pot. Combine onions and pepper in
small amount of water in saucepan and cook until onion is tender.

Drain, then add soup, mushrooms, pimiento, milk, and basil. Layer
HALF of soup mixture, half of cottage cheese, half of chicken, and
half of parmesan in casserole. Repeat layers. Cover and bake for 30
minutes.

Sylvia's comments: don't ask me why this is a "three cheese" bake when
there are only two types of cheese. I skipped the onion and bell
pepper and substituted chopped green olives for the pimiento. I also
used three-color rotini (which I had) for the lasagna noodles I
didn't have. Came out great. Definitely a keeper.
