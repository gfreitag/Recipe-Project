You can use the skinned chicken halves as they are, but it is better
to discard the wing, the rib bones and the back bones

With a sharp knife make shallow gashes all over the skinned halves.
Rub the chicken with the salt and then some lime or lemon juice.

In a large bowl combine the yogurt, garlic, cayenne, cumin, coriander,
ginger, food coloring and black pepper. Brush the chicken thoroughly
with this mixture, getting deep into the gashes. Marinate the chicken,
refrigerated, in the mixture for 4 to 5 hours or overnight.

Preheat the oven or broiler to 450F.

Thread each chicken half along its length on a long metal skewer and
cook for 5 minutes on one side, then turn and cook for 5 minutes on
the other side.  Brush with melted butter and cook for 10 minutes
more on each side or until the chicken is done and the suface is
golden brown

Sprinkle with the remaining lime or lemon juice and with black pepper.
Garnish with the lime or lemon wedges and the tomato and onion slices.
Serve hot.
