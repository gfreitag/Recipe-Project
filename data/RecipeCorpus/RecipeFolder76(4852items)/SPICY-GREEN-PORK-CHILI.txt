Title: SPICY GREEN PORK CHILI
Categories: Pork
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 lb Boneless pork chops
16 oz Stewed tomatoes
45 oz Black beans
32 oz Light red kidney beans
1 lg Yellow onion
2    Cloves garlic -- crushed
2 ea Jalapeno peppers -- chopped
1 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Butter
Salt and pepper
Tabasco (just a little)
Water (add to desired
Consistency)
Trim excess fat from chops; dice into bite-size chunks. Lightly saute.
Drain on paper towel; saute onion, garlic, and jalapeno in butter. Add
pork, onion, garlic, and jalapeno together in pot. Add black beans,
kidney beans, and stewed tomatoes.  Do not drain beans. Add 7 ounce
can of diced canned jalapeno.

I usually use a crock pot because the longer the chili simmers, the
better it is.  When done, the pork should be really tender. The pork
will also darken due to the black beans. Can serve in bowls as usual
or over white rice.
