Sweet and Sour Cucumber Relish (Taeng Kwa Brio Wan)

Toss the cucumber, onion and chili flakes together in a bowl. In a
small saucepan, over low heat, dissolve the sugar in the water.
Remove from heat and stir in the vinegar and salt. Pour this mixture
over the veggies. Stir and refrigerate until served.

From "The Original Thai Cookbook" by Jennifer Brennan GD/Perigee,
published by Putnam. 1981.

This a is quick 'n' easy dish that's refreshing--good for a barbecue
on a hot summer day. Some of the sucessful variations that I've tried
have been: Rice vinegar for white, add thinly sliced red or green hot
chilis, use palm sugar instead of granulated.
