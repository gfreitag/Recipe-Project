Title: THE BASIC I-HATE-TO-COOK MUFFINS
Categories: Breads, Muffins, Prodigy
Yield: 10 Servings  1 	C  Beer 2 	C Buttermilk Baking Mix Mix it so it's barely a batter
but no more....don't beat it. Pour it into 8 or 12 greased muffin
tins or cups. Bake at 400' for about 12 minutes. There will be a few
ounces of beer left in the can, but I'm sure you can think of
something to do with it!

Serve hot with butter and jam.....
