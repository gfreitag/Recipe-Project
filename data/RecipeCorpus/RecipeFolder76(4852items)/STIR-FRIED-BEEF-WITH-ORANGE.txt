CUT THE BEEF into thin slices 2 inches long, cutting against the
grain. Put the beef into a bowl together with the soy sauce, rice
wine or sherry, ginger, cornstarch and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil. Mix
well, then let the mixture marinate for about 20 minutes. Heat the
oil in a wok or large skillet until it is very hot. Remove the beef
from the marinade with a slotted spoon. Add it to the pan and
stir-fry it for 2 minutes until it browns. Remove it and leave to
drain in a colander or sieve. Pour off most of the oil, leaving about
1 teaspoon. Reheat the pan over a high heat and then add the dried
chiles. Stir-fry them for 10 seconds, and then return the beef to the
pan. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir-fry for 4 minutes,
mixing well. Serve the dish at once.
