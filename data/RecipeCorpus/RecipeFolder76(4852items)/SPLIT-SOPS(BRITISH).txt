Richard II (1377-1399) The leek was a popular vegetable in the Middle
Ages, perhaps because of the belief that it stimulated the appetite.
But leek also had its harmful effects
: "It causes headache and gives bad dreams . . . after eating it, some
lettuce, purslane, or endive should be taken, to temper its heating
effects." What follows is a medieval cousin to vichyssoise. 1. Remove
green tops and roots of leeks. Cut white section in half lengthwise
and once across the middle. Wash thoroughly. 2. Melt butter in a
heavy saucepan. Toss leeks to coat, and saute over a gentle flame
until they begin to wilt (about 5 minutes). 3.Add wine, salt, and
pepper to taste. Simmer an additional Io to 15 minutes until leeks
are done. 4.Blend in beurre manie to thicken just before serving.
5.Serve in soup bowls over toast or croutons.
