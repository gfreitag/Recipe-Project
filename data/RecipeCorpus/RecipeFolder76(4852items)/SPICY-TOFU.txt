Title: SPICY TOFU
Categories: Main dish, Thai, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Firm tofu
1/4 c  Red onion, sliced
1 ea Green onion, chopped
1/4 c  Mint leaves, chopped
2 lb Assorted vegetables, chopped
2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Lime juice
1/2 ts Ground toasted rice*
1 tb Ground roasted chilies+
Cut the tofu into cubes.  Set aside on paper towels to drain. Heat a
wok & add the tofu without oil. Stir-fry until heated through, but
not crisp. Put in a mixing bowl. Add all the remaining ingredients
except the assorted vegetables & lettuce.  Mix thoroughly. Line a
serving bowl with a layer of lettuce leaves & pour the saute over
them. Serve surrounded by rice & assorted vegetables. *Heat uncooked
rice over moderate heat until golden, stirring to prevent burning.
When the colour is uniform, remove from heat, cool & gring to a
powder. It is best to use a mortar & pestle. +Roast whole chilies,
stems too, in a dry wok until they darken. Be careful that they do
not burn.  Cool. Remove stems & seeds. Grind.
