between Holly McCord of Prevention magazine and chef, Bobbie Flay of
the Mesa Grill, NYC. * Rinse husks; soak 2 hrs. in warm water. *
Puree corn, onion and broth in a food processor. Transfer to a bowl;
cut in margarine. Using your fingers, mix in cornmeal and pepper (to
taste) until margarine is blended. Mash in sweet potatoes. * Drain 16
husks; pat dry. (Tear remaining husks into 1-in.-wide strips for
tying ends.) Lay 2 husks flat, tapered ends facing out and broad
bases overlapping by about 3 in. Place 1/2 C. of cornmeal mixture in
center. Bring long sides up, overlapping slightly; pat to close. Tie
ends with cornhusk strips. Trim ends. * Steam single layers of
tamales, covered tightly, on rack over boiling water for 45 min. To
serve, slit tops; push ends toward middle to expose filling. Top with
1 tbsp. orange-honey butter, as follows: Boil 1 c. orange juice;
reduce to 1/3 c. Remove from heat; cool. Whip in 2 Tbsp. honey, 1
tbsp. light margarine (softened) and black pepper to taste.
