Title: SUPREMES DE VOLAILLE ROUGE ET VERT
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 2 Servings
1    Chicken breast,
-whole
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
Juice of 1 lime
1/2 c  White wine
1 ts Ginger
1    Garlic clove,
-finely chopped
1 pn Tarragon
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
Juice of 1 lime
3 oz White wine
Butter (salted)
3 oz Tomato paste
Mix the marinade ingredients.  Bone the chicken breast, obtaining 2
supremes, and marinate for at least 30 minutes. Reserve bones.

Cook a bouillon using the bones.  You will need about
3 oz of bouillon.

Drain, flatten and flour the supremes.  Saute quickly in clarified
butter, about two minutes on each side. Remove and keep warm.

Raise the heat to high, add wine, lime juice, tomato paste and
bouillon. Cook down until it looks like it's been cooked too much.
Remove from heat and swirl in a goodly chunk of butter. If you remove
the sauce too soon, it will be too soupy. The sauce should be
cinnamon-coloured and shiny. There will be very little sauce, you may
need a rubber scraper to get it out of the pan.

Serve with rice or some other bland vegetable.

Experiment with the sauce, varying the ratio of ingredients. I have
just strained the chunky bits from the marinade and used that. Wear a
raincoat when making the sauce. It splatters.

NOTES:

*  Chicken breasts in tomato-lime sauce -- This recipe was originally
posted to net.cooks in May of '82 by Martin Minow @ decvax. The
French name means "boneless chicken breasts in red and green sauce."
I like it a lot.
