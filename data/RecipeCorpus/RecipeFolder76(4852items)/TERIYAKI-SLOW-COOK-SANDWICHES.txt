and garlic. Stir in meat. Cover; cook on the low-heat setting for 7
to 9 hours or on the high-heat setting for 3 to 4 hours.

Use a slotted spoon to remove meat from juices. Pour juices into a
measuring cup; skim fat. Measure 1 1/2 cups juices (add water if
necessary); place in a saucepan. Stir together cornstarch and the 2
tablespoons water; add to saucepan. Cook and stir until thickened and
bubbly. Stir in the cooked meat. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more.

the unheated rack of a broiler pan. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat for
2 to 3 minutes or until lightly toasted. Top bottom halves of the
toasted rolls with meat mixture and desired toppings. Cover with roll
tops.
