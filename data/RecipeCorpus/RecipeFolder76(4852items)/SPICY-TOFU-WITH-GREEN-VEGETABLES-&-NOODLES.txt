all the sauce ingredients in a small mixing bowl. Heat the oil in a
wok & fry the marinated tofu until it is golden on all sides. Remove,
place on paper towels & pat dry to remove excess oil. Pour excess oil
out of the wok. Stir fry the vegetables in the order in which they
appear listed above. Be careful not to overcook. At the last minute,
pour the sauce over the cooked vegetables & add the tofu. Mix gently.
Serve over Oriental style noodles. VARIATION: Serve over rice instead
of noodles. *Available at most Asian grocery stores.
