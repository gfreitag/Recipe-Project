Categories: Crockpot
Yield: 12 Servings
12 lg Cabbage leaves
1 lb Lean ground beef
1    Egg; beaten
1 c  Cooked rice
1/4 c  Milk
1 cn Tomato sauce; 8 oz
1/4 c  Finely chopped onion
1 tb Brown sugar
1 tb Lemon juice

1 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/4 ts Pepper
Immerse cabbage leaves in large kettle of boiling water for about 3
minutes, or until limp; drain.  Combine egg, milk, onion, salt,
pepper, beef and cooked rice. Place about 1/4 cup meat mixture in
center of each leaf; fold in sides and roll ends over meat.
Place in slow-cooking pot. Combine tomato sauce with brown sugar,
lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce. Pour over cabbage rolls. Cover,
and cook on Low 7 to 9 hours. Makes 6 servings. NOTE: instead of
using the slow-cooking pot, put them in a shallow roasting pan
(covered) in the oven at 350 degrees for (just guessing) about 1
hour. Helen Jolly.
