3 lg Apples, washed
Juice from half a lemon
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1 tb Red hot candies (or 1/2
-teaspoon ground cinnamon)
3/4 c  Water
Core and slice the apples. Place apples in a medium bowl and pour the
lemon juice over them. Toss and set aside.

In a flat pan, combine sugar, candies and water. Bring to a boil over
medium-high heat. Stir until the sugar and candies dissolve. Add the
apple slices, a few at a time. Cook until tender, about 3 to 5
minutes, depending on the thickness of the slices, then remove from
the syrup. Continue this process until you have poached all the
apples. Cover and refrigerate the apples until serving time, and
discard the syrup or refrigerate for other uses.

Serve the apples as a garnish or filling for low-fat cho- colate
desserts.
