Categories: Main dish, Beef, Grill
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Beef flank steak
1/4 c  Dry sherry
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Water
2 tb Lemon juice, fresh
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Ginger-root, grated
1    Garlic clove, minced
Freeze steak for 20 minutes or until firm.  With sharp knife, slice
across the grain into 1/4" thick diagonal slices. Arrange slices in
shallow baking dish. Combine remaining ingredients; pour over meat.
Cover; refrigerate several hours or overnight.
About 45 minutes before cooking, light the fire. Place grill 4"
above the coals.  Drain meat, reserving marinade. Gently lay strips
across grill. Cook 3-4 minutes, turning once and basting with
reserved marinade.
NOTE: If available, use hinged grilling rack, which will make it
easier to turn meat.
