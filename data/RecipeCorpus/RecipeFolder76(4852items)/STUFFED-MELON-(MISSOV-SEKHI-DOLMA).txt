Categories: Armenian, Fruits, Harned 1994, Main dish, Veal
Yield: 2 Servings
1 lg Cantaloupe
2 tb Butter
1/2 lb Ground lean lamb or
1/2 lb Ground lean beef
1 md Onion; finely chopped
1/2 c  Long-grain white rice
-- uncooked
1/4 c  Pine nuts
1/4 c  Dried currants
1 1/2 tb Sugar; or to taste (opt'l.)
1/4 ts Cinnamon

1 c  ;Water
Cut about one inch off the top of the melon; reserve. This will later
serve as a lid.  Clean out the inside of the melon and discard seeds.
With a long handled spoon, scoop out 1 cup of the center pulp and
chop.

In a heavy skillet, heat butter over moderate heat. Add the meat and
onion; saute until browned, stirring frequently. Add the rice, pine
nuts, currants, 1 tb. sugar, cinnamon, salt, chopped melon pulp and
water; mix well.  Cook until liquid in the pan is absorbed, stirring
occasionally. Remove from heat; cool to room temperature.

Sprinkle the inside of the melon with the remaining 1/2 tb. of sugar
and spoon the meat stuffing into it. Cover with the reserved top;
secure with wooden picks. Place in an oiled baking pan just large
enough to hold the melon comfortably.  Bake at 350 F. for one hour,
or until tender.

Uvezian writes: "The exquisitely delicate flavor and aroma of this
unique dish will linger in your memory."
