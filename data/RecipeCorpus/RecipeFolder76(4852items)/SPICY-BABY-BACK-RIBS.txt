This recipe is a favorite of old Charles Franz, whose father Mark is
the chef at Stars.

Combine all seasoning ingredients and pour over ribs. Marinate
overnight in the refrigerator .

Grill ribs over medium heat, using either mesquite or charcoal
briquettes, basting constantly with the marinade for about 1 hour.
The trick is to have just the right heat: too much and the ribs bum,
too little and they do not cook.

Slice and serve with lots of beer++for the parents, that is!

Serves 5.
