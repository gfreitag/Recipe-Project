sugar and stir well. Place over high heat and, stirring constantly,
bring quickly to a full boil, with bubbles over the entire surface.
Add the remaining ingredients except the pectin. Boil hard for 1
minute, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and add the pectin.
Skim off any foam. Ladle into 8 hot half-pint jars. Seal, then
process for 4 minutes in a hot water bath, counting the time from
when the water comes again to a rolling boil after immersing the jars.

This recipe is from Marcia Adams "cooking from quilt country". since
I had to type it up for a relative who requested it I decided I might
as well post it also. It is one of my favorite jam recipes and often
requested.
