of fat from the ham.  Using a small sharp knife, make X shaped cuts
about 2 inches deep and 1 inch apart all over the fat side of the
ham. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Squeeze as much water as possible
from the thawed kale and spinach,  Put then in the food processor
along with the onion, watercress, celery leaves, salt and pepper.
Pulse until the vegetables are finely chopped. Press the vegetable
mixture into the cavities you have cut inot the ham, packing it down
well.  Place the ham fat side up , in a shallow baking pan.  Bake for
2 hours. Stir together honey, vinegar, mustard and ginger and brush
part of mixture onto ham. Continue baking and basting for 30 minutes,
until ham is richly glazed. REmove ham from the oven and let it rest
for 20 minutes for easier carving. Carve carefully, holding the
slices to keep stuffing in place. Garnish platter with watercress if
you like.
