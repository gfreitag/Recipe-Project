SPINACH MENA

[Recipes from folk singer Ritasue Charlestein]

....................................................... ..........
This wonderful Sephardic dish, perfect for Passover, tastes like
spinach lasagna. The filling can also be meat cooked with tomatoes
and spices. .......................................................

PREHEAT oven to 350F. Oil a 8 or 9 inch square pan.

IN medium bowl, mix spinach, parsley, green onions, cottage cheese,
dill, 2 of the eggs, Parmesan and matzoh meal. Season to taste with
salt and pepper.

FILL one bowl with hot water and a second with the remaining 2 eggs
beaten with 2 teaspoons water. Dip one matzoh at a time into water
bath. Leave 2 minutes to soften. Blot with paper towel and dip into
egg mixture.

LINE bottom of one pan with one matzoh. Split 2 matzohs in half and
line sides of pan. Fill with spinach mixture and top with remaining
matzoh.

BRUSH oil on top of matzoh. Bake 30 minutes. Sprinkle with Parmesan
and bake another 15 minutes or until filling is set and top is browned
slightly. It will firm up as it cools. Serve warm. From An Article:
