Title: SPICY EGGS
Categories: Eggs, Brunch, Main dish
Yield: 2 Servings
25 g  Butter
-OR sunflower margarine
2    Spring onions
-- finely sliced
1 ts Garam masala
2    Tomatoes; skinned
- and very finely chopped
1 ts Turmeric (more if desired)
3    Eggs; beaten
Salt and pepper
Coriander leaves to garnish
This is a kind of scrambled eggs 'Indian Style': a stir-fry of spring
onions and tomatoes is flavoured with garam masala and turmeric, and
then the eggs are scrambled into the mixture. Lovely with chapatis
and a mixed salad.

Melt the butter or margarine in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and soften
the spring onions over a gentle heat for 4-5 minutes. Then add the
garam masala and the chopped tomatoes and cook for a further 3-4
minutes. Season with the turmeric, salt and pepper and mix well, then
pour in the eggs and begin to scramble them, stirring with a fork.
When the eggs are lightly set but still moist - not dry and
overcooked - serve at once on warm plates with a mixed salad and
chapatis, garnished with fresh coriander leaves.

To skin tomatoes:

Put the tomatoes into a bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave to
stand for 3-4 minutes, then the skin will peel off easily with a
sharp knife.
