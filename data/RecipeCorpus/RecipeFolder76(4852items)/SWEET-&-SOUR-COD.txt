Rinse fish with cold water; pat dry with paper towels. Cut fish into
1-inch cubes; transfer to shallow glass baking dish or bowl. Combine
wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon
monosodium glutamate; mix well.  Pour mixture over fish; marinate 1/2
hour. Prepare Sweet and Sour Sauce while fish is marinating. Mix
together egg and cornstarch to form stiff batter. Drain fish well;
combine with batter. Carefully drop battered fish, one at a time,
into heated oil in deep fryer or saucepan. Fry, over medium heat,
until crisp and golden brown (approximately 6-8 minutes).  Drain on
paper towels; keep warm. In wok, or large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons
oil. Add remaining ingredients and stir fry to 2-4 minutes, or until
vegetables are tender but not limp. Add Sweet and Sour Sauce and
blend.  Add fish, combine well and serve immediately. Serve with
