cover and let dough rest 15 minutes. Then roll dough into a 12" by 3"
rope. Cut dough into 12 pieces and roll each peace into a 4" round.
Top each round with 2 Tbl of the chilled potato filling and pinch the
edges of the dough over the filling to form a dumpling. Tap the
filled dough with the rolling pin to flatten. Dust the dough with
flour and roll it into a 7" circle. Heat the skillet over medium-high
heat. Brush skillet with oil and cook breadsd on each side until
lightly browned, about 5 minutes total. While cooking subsequent
batches place cooked breads covered on a cookies sheet or tortilla
warmer in a 200 degree oven.
