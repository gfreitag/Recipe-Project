Title: SWORDFISH BOURSIN
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Swordfish steaks
1 c  Chablis
1/2 c  Boursin cheese
1 ea Egg yolk
1 tb Cream, whipping
Swordfish steaks should be cut about 1" thick.  Place steaks in
shallow baking dish with enough wine to cover the bottom of pan. Bake
at 350 degrees 20 to 25 minutes or until the fish flakes when tested
with a fork. Meanwhile, combine Alouette, egg yolk and cream until
smooth.  Remove fish to a broiler proof pan (better still cook it in
one!) and spoon the sauce over the top.  Place under broiler until
sauce turns golden and is browned.
