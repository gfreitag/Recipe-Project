Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil and add beans. Cook for 10
seconds, drain, and plunge immediately into a bowl of ice water.
Drain; peel one end of each bean and squeeze gently to pop bean from
skin. Discard skins. Set beans aside.

2. Cut lemon in half and squeeze over celery. Sprinkle with chopped
parsley. Arrange beans, celery, cheese, endive leaves, and olives on a
serving platter and garnish with parsley sprigs.

*Ricotta salata is a dry cheese available in Italian markets. If you
can't find it, try percorino or feta instead.
