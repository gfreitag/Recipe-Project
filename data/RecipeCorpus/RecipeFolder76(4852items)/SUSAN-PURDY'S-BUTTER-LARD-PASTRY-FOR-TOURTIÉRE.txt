Title: SUSAN PURDY'S BUTTER-LARD PASTRY FOR TOURTIÃ‰RE
Categories: Pastry, Canadian
Yield: 2 Crusts
2 c  Flour, all-purpose
3/4 ts Salt
1/3 c  Lard; cut up
1/3 c  Butter, unsalted; cut up
5 T  ;Water, ice, to 6 T
Sift the flour and salt into the work bowl of a food processor fitted
with a steel blade. Cover the bowl and pulse quickly, turning the
machine on and off two or three times. Uncover the bowl and add the
cut-up lard and butter. Process 5 to 10 seconds until the dough has
the texture of rough cornmeal.

Through the feed tube, add part of the water. Pulse two or three
times. Add remaining liquid and pulse twice or several times,
watching the dough and stopping the instant the dough starts to clump
together. It will still look rough and lumpy. Turn the dough out onto
a piece of wax paper. Lift the opposite corners of the paper and
press on the dough, forming it into a ball. Wrap up the dough and
refrigerate 20 to 30 minutes, or several hours. Divide the dough in
half and use as directed in the Tourtiere recipe.
