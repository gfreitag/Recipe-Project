Contrasting texture, color and appearance are hallmarks of this im-
pressive banquet dish.

Preparation:  Slice bamboo shoot across grain into 2" triangles. Peel
& slice carrots on bias.  Remove strings from peas & wash. If substi-
tuting broccoli, use peeled stems only; slice thinly on bias. Shred
lettuce; arrange like nest on round 10" serving plate.

Making Potato Basket:  Peel, then coarsely shred potatoes. Or, slice
potatoes into thin matchsticks. Rinse potatoes in cold water twice;
soak them 30 minutes in cold salted water; rinse & drain. Slowly heat
deep-frying oil in wok to medium hot; test potato slice: it should
brown in 30 seconds.  Dust potatoes with cornstarch so they will
stick together when fried.  Arrange them in a cross-hatch pattern on
Chinese wire strainer or other suitable strainer to form deep basket.
Press them in position with another strainer. If you use bowl for
pressing, heat it first, because you don't want to cool frying oil.
Immerse in oil & deep-fry until potatoes begin to brown. Remove from
oil; take away top strainer only; drain; reserve.

When ready to serve, heat oil to very hot, but not smoking; deep-fry
potatoes in strainer again until they are brown & crisp. Place basket
in nest of lettuce.

Blanching:  Dip scallops in hot but not boiling water; remove in 15
seconds when scallops are warmed: don`t allow them to cook.

Stir-frying:  As you heat wok to medium hot, stir-fry ginger slices &
garlic to flavor wok; remove when they start to brown; discard. When
wok is hot, add peanut oil & salt; stir. Add bamboo shoots & carrots;
stir-fry 1 minute.  Add stock.  When stock boils, add scallops, snow
peas, sugar, white pepper, gin & soy sauce. Stir 1 minute. Add
cornstarch paste to thicken. Transfer to potato basket. Serve.
