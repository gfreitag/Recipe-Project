Halve or quarter the fish filets so they will fit into a medium-sized
saucepan. Combine the chicken broth, jalapeno juice and lime juice.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Add the fish pieces
and simmer 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the
fish cool in the liquid for 30 minutes. Remove the fish and pat dry
with paper towels. Place the fish in a medium-size bowl and break
into flakes with your fingers or a fork. Add the scallions and tomato
and toss to mix. Season with the salt and pepper. Arrange 2
tablespoons of the fish filling down the center of each taco shell.
Divide the lettuce among the shells and top each taco with 1
tablespoon tomatillo salsa.
