Title: SZECHUAN EGGPLANT
Categories: Main dish, Low-fat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg Eggplant
1 bn Scallions, sliced
2 tb Hot Szechuan sauce
2 tb Reduced sodium teriyaki
-sauce
1/4 c  Cold water
Peel eggplant.  Cut into 2 inch thick rounds, then slice the rounds
into wedges (i.e., think of how pizza is cut). Saute in some water or
broth in a non stick pan, turning to cook the wedges evenly. Cook for
about 3-5 minutes per side, or until the slices are done to your
liking. Add the scallions.  Mix the sauces and water and pour into
the pan. Stir to coat. Serve over plain rice with lots of water (the
sauce I used was HOT!). Notes: I used House of Tsang hot Szechuan
sauce. It was not totally fatfree, but was all I had. The oils were
very far down on the list of ingredients. The teriyaki was FF.  I am
sure that you can find FF Szechuan sauce, however, so I posted this
recipe anyway. Also, I recommend that you use just a touch of the hot
sauce at first.
