Title: THE DREADED HAGGIS
Categories: Lamb, Ethnic
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Sheep's stomach
1    Sheep heart
1    Sheep liver
1/2 lb Fresh suet (kidney leaf fat
-is preferred)
3/4 c  Oatmeal
3    Onions, finely chopped
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/4 ts Cayenne
1/2 ts Nutmeg
3/4 c  Stock
Wash stomach well, rub with salt and rinse. Remove membranes and
excess fat. Soak in cold salted water for several hours. Turn stomach
inside out for stuffing.

Cover heart and liver with cold water, Bring to a boil, reduce heat,
cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Chop heart and coarsely grate liver.
Toast oatmeal in a skillet on top of the stove, stirring frequently,
until golden. Combine all ingredients and mix well. Loosely pack
mixture into stomach, about two-thirds full. Remember, oatmeal
expands in cooking.

Press any air out of stomach and truss securely. Put into boiling
water to cover. Simmer for 3 hours, uncovered, adding more water as
needed to maintain water level. Prick stomach several times with a
sharp needle when it begins to swell; this keeps the bag from
bursting. Place on a hot platter, removing trussing strings. Serve
with a spoon. Ceremoniously served with "neeps and nips"--mashed
turnips, nips of whiskey and mashed potatoes.
