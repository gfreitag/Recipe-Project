Title: STEPHANIE'S CINNAMON ROLLS (CINNABONS)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Warm water
2 pk Dry yeast
1 sm (3 1/2 oz) pkg. instant
-vanilla pudding
2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Margarine, melted
2    Eggs, beaten
1 ts Salt
8 c  Flour
In small bowl, combine water, yeast and sugar. Stir until dissolved.
Set aside.  In large bowl take the pudding mix and milk and prepare
according to package directions. Add margarine, eggs and salt. Mix
well. Then add the yeast mixture. Blend together and gradually add
flour and knead until smooth.  Place in a very large greased bowl.
Cover and let rise until doubled.  Punch down and let rise again.
Then roll out on lightly floured surface to 34 X 21 inches. Take 1
cup margarine melted, and spread over surface.  In small bowl, mix 2
cups brown sugar and 6 Tablespoons cinnamon. Sprinkle all over top of
surface. Roll up from long end very tightly. With a knife put a notch
every 2 inches. Now with a string or I prefer a thread*, place under
roll by notch and criss-cross over to cut roll. (*This makes nice
clean cuts!) Place on greased baking pan, 2" apart. Take hand and
lightly press down roll. (JUST A LITTLE...IT HELPS HOLD IT TOGETHER!)
Cover and let rise till doubled again. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to
20 minutes.  Take them out when they start to turn golden brown. Do
not overbake! Frost warm rolls with the following: CREAM CHEESE
FROSTING 8 oz. softened cream cheese 1/2 cup margarine, softened 1
tsp vanilla 3 cups powdered sugar About 1 Tb. milk (just enough to
fluff) Combine all ingredients and mix till smooth.  Spread on very
warm rolls. NOTE: You can make these the night before. Mix up the
recipe and let it rise once. Punch down and cover for the second
rising, putting in the refrigerator overnight to slowly rise. In the
morning let it complete rising, roll it out and finish it up. They
also freeze well and can be warmed up in the microwave nicely!
