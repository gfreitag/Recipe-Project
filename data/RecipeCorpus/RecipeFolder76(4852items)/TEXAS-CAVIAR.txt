Title: TEXAS CAVIAR
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 10 Servings
2 c  Dried black beans
1    Ham hock
Salt and pepper; to taste
1 tb Oil
1    Onion
2    Green peppers
3    Tomatoes
- peeled, seeded and chopped
PLACE THE BEANS in a pot and fill it with water 4 inches above the
beans. Add the ham hock, cover and place over high heat. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 hours. Add water as
necessary during the cooking so that the beans are always barely
covered. Remove cover during the last hour and let the liquid thicken
a bit. Add salt and pepper at the end. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a
skillet, add the onion and peppers and cook until soft, about 7
minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook another minute. When it's time to
serve the beans, mix the onion, pepper and tomatoes to the beans.
