1/4 c  corn oil
Yield: 1 Servings
12    arbol chiles -- with seeds
2    Roma (plum) tomatoes
6 md cloves garlic
3/4 c  water
1/4 ts Mexican oregano -- toasted
1/4 ts kosher salt
1/4 ts cumin -- toasted and ground

This is typical of what you would find on tables in northern Mexico,
where salsas tend to be a little brutal -- hot and very direct with
uncomplicated flavors. I love this kind of salsa on quesadillas and
broiled meats. A great all-purpose condiment, a spoonful or two will
enliven almost any dish. Be careful, though. People in the north like
their food hot.

Pan roast tomatoes until blistered, deeply browned, and soft. Pan
roast garlic until brown and soft, then peel.

Heat the corn oil in a medium-sized skillet until hot but not
smoking. Fry the chiles, 1 or 2 at a time, until puffed and brown,
about 10 seconds. Do not burn or they will taste bitter. Shake off
excess oil from chiles and place in a blender. Add 2 tablespoons
chile cooking oil, tomatoes, garlic, and water. Blend until smooth.
Add the oregano, salt, and cumin and blend again. Keeps, tightly
covered, about 3 days in the refrigerator.
