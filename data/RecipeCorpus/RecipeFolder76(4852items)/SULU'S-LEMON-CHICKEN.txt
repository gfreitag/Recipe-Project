Title: SULU'S LEMON CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Star trek
Yield: 8 Servings
1    Med onion,thinly sliced
1    Lemon
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Japanese light soy sauce
1/4 c  Sake or white wine
4    Whole chicken breasts,halved
Egg
3/4 c  Flour
1/3 c  Cooking oil
Put onion in large bowl. Cut the ends off the lemon, slice it and add
to the onion. Add the sugar, sake, and soy sauce; stir well. Rinse
and pat dry the chicken breasts, put them in the bowl and spoon the
marinade over them. Marinate them for an hour at room temperature,
stirring occasionally to be sure that all pieces are more or less
equally marinated. In a dish or small mixing bowl, thoroughly beat
the egg. Put the flour in a plastic bag, dip a couple of the chicken
breasts in the egg and shake them with the flour in the bag to coat
them. Heat the oil in the pan and add the floured chicken breasts.
Repeat until all the pieces are coated and in the frypan. Brown the
chicken on both sides over medium heat (it should take about 20 to 30
minutes) and then add the marinade and simmer until the chicken is
well cooked, perhaps another 30 minutes.
