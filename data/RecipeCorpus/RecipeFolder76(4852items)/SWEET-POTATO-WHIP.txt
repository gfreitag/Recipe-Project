Title: SWEET POTATO WHIP
Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 1 Servings
12    Sweet potatoes (pricked all
Over with a fork)
1/2 c  Nonfat plain yogurt
4 c  Defatted chicken broth
Substitute
2 1/4 lb Carrots
Cinnamon or mace to taste
(1/4 tsp)
Salt and pepper to taste
(optional)
Bake the sweet potatoes at 375 for 1.25 hrs or until soft. Let them
cool to room temperature.

Cook the carrots in the broth until tender 20 to 25 minutes Reserve
1/2 c of broth.

Scoop out the inside of the cooled potatoes into a large bowl add the
carrots, 1/2 c of broth, yogurt and cinnamon.

Mash together and then put 1/2 in a food processor then do the other
half. Mix together.

Put in the oven for 15 minutes at 375 before serving.

COMMENTS: The carrots help alleviate the sweetness of the potatoes.

The food processor is not necessary if you have a good potato masher
and the  carrots are tender enough.

This was a great dish to prepare the night before. Except that before
serving you would need to put it in the oven for 30 minutes instead
of 15 minutes.
