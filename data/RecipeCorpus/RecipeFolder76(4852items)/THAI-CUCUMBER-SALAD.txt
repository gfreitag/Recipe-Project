Categories: Salads, Thai, Ours
Yield: 4 Servings

-when I made this for you)

-use green onion)
2 ts Finely chopped lime peel
1 1/2 tb Lime juice
2 ts Fish sauce (or just use a
-little salt)
1 ts Brown sugar

Brown peanuts at high heat in a wok with the oil (or brown in
microwave, one minute at a time). Chop them up. Peel cucumber and
remove seeds. Grate one half of the cucumber with a cheese grater,
and slice the other half in very thin slices (or grate the whole
thing, or slice the whole thing, depending on which you like best)

Mix everything together and serve. Be sure to put the peanuts on just
before you serve it or they will get soggy.
