2 oz Uncooked linguine
1/2 c  Shredded carrot
8 oz Medium shrimp, cooked and
-peeled
1 c  Thinly sliced Boston lettuce
-leaves
1/4 c  Fresh cilantro leaves
2 tb Chopped unsalted,
-dry-roasted peanuts

2 tb Fish sauce
2 tb Chopped fresh cilantro

2 1/2 ts Sugar
2 ts Vegetable oil

2    Garlic cloves, minced
Store the shrimp-pasta mixture and vinaigrette separately in the
refrigerator; toss just before serving. Fish sauce is a salty
condiment that accounts for the high sodium content of this salad. It
comes bottled and is sometimes labeled nam pla in Asian markets or
your supermarket's ethnic-food section.

1. Cook pasta in boiling water 9-1/2 minutes. Add carrot; cook an
additional 30 seconds. Drain, and cool. Combine pasta mixture, shrimp,
lettuce, cilantro leaves, and peanuts in a large bowl; toss well.

2. Combine lime juice and remaining ingredients in a jar. Cover
tightly, and shake vigorously. Pour over pasta mixture, tossing
gently to coat. Yield: 2 servings (serving size: 2 cups).
