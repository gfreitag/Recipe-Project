Categories: Salads
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
1 bn Broccoli (about I pound)
1/4 ts Reduced sodium soy sauce
1 tb Granulated sugar
2 tb Rice vinegar
2 qt Water
2 tb Oriental sesame oil
1 tb Minced garlic (3 cloves)
1 tb Minced fresh ginger
3/4 ts Dried red pepper flakes or
-dried chile flakes
With sharp knife, peel away tough, outer skin covering stem of
broccoli. Cut away florets, cutting up larger pieces on diagonal. Cut
stems into 1-inch sections. Combine soy sauce, sugar and vinegar in
small bowl, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Set aside.

Heat water in large pan until boiling and add broccoli. Return to
boil and cook until stems and florets are just tender, about 3
minutes. (jab pieces with sharp knife--it should go through stems
easily.) Drain in colander and rinse under cold running water to
cool. Drain thoroughly and place in mixing bowl.

Heat wok or skillet over high heat. Add sesame oil and heat until
hot. Add garlic, ginger and red pepper flakes and stir-fry about 10
seconds until fragrant. Add soy sauce mixture and cook about 30
seconds, stirring constantly. Pour sauce over broccoli, tossing to
coat. Let stand at least 30 minutes at room temperature, or cover
with plastic wrap and chill several hours before serving. Serve at
room temperature or cold.
