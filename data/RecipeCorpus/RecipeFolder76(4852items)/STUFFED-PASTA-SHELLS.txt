Stuffing for Shells---

3 c  fat-free mozzarella cheese
1/2 c  fat-free parmesan cheese
2    egg whites

1/2 ts black pepper

To prepare spaghetti sauce, saute mushrooms, onions, peppers, and
garlic until tender. Then, add meat and cook until no pink remains.
Drain. Stir in undrained tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, oregano,
basil, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover; and simmer
for 30 minutes. Then, set aside. Preheat oven at 350. To prepare
stuffing, bring water to a boil in a large pot and add shells. Return
to a boil, then continue cooking for 5 to 6 minutes more, or until
shells are barely tender. Drain and set aside on flat baking sheet
(to prevent sticking). In a mixing bowl, combine cottage cheese, 2
cups mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg whites, parsley, salt,
and pepper. Pour 1 cup of spaghetti sauce onto bottom of a 13 x 9 x
2" pan. Fill each shell generously with cheese mixture, about 1
tablespoon in each shell. Place filled shells in pan. Pour remaining
spaghetti sauce over each shell, then top with remaining mozzarella
cheese. Bake for 45 minutes or until golden.
