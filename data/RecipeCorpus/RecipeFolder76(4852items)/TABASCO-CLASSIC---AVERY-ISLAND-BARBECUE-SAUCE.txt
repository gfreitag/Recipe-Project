~----------------- In a heavy nonaluminum saucepan over medium heat,
melt the butter and saute the onion, celery, pepper, and garlic for 5
minutes, or until the onion is tender but not browned. Add the
remaining ingredients.  Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, until the
sauce thickens, stirring occasionally. Discard the lemon slices and
bay leaf. Brush the sauce on chicken, ribs, frankfurters, or
hamburgers during grilling, broiling, or baking. Makes 2-1/4 cup.
