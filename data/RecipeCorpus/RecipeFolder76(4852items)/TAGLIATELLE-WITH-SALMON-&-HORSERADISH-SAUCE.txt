Cook the pasta according to instructions. Poach the salmon in
simmering, salted water, for about 10 minutes, until just done. In
another pan on low fire, stir the milk and cream cheese until the
cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth. Bring the sauce just to a

bite-sized pieces. Divide the pasta on two plates, topped with salmon
and sauce. Lekker with spinach.
