Title: TAPENADE VERTE (GREEN OLIVE SPREAD)
Categories: Condiments, French, Spreads, Restaurant/
12 oz jar pitted green salad
-olives -- drained
Yield: 1 Servings
:
1    shallot -- finely chopped
1 ts fresh lemon juice
freshly ground pepper
:
1/2 c  olive oil
1    handful chives -- chopped

In a food processor or small mixer, combine olives, shallot, lemon
juice, pepper and half of the olive oil. Add anchovies if desired.

Pulse until mixture is a course paste consistency. Use more oil if
necessary.  I like to vary the coarseness according to what I am
going to serve.  A coarser consistency is good for vegetable crudites
(a basket of green onions, fennel slices, cherry tomatoes). A
smoother tapenade is good spread on thin slices of baguette, toasted,
or thicker chunks of sourdough bread.  For a smoother tapenade, use
all of the olive oil and blend until creamy and smooth.  Top with a
sprinkling of chives and serve.
