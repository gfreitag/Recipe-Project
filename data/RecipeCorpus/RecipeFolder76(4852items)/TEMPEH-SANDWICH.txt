Title: TEMPEH SANDWICH
Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Piece tempeh -- about the
Size of a
Oil
1 ts Soy sauce
Chopped onions and
Mushrooms
2 sl Bread
Mayo or the equivalent
Tomato slices/other raw
Veggies as desired
1.  (I usually use 2 pans (because I add an egg) but you can make
this with one.) Heat oil in pans, saute onions and mushrooms, put
aside when done.

2.  Fry tempeh on both sides. When nearly done, add a teaspoon or so
of soy sauce to each side and turn over to cook (it will splatter).

3.  While this is all cooking (and try to time it to all come out at
the same time), toast your bread and spread liberally with mayo (any
variety), spaghetti sauce or something gooey.

4.  Construct a sandwich with bread, tempeh, tomato, onion/mushroom
mixture, and other veggies (optional). Serve hot.

Author's Notes: Here is one of my favorite recipes that use tempeh.

For an incredibly messy (and non-vegan) option, try adding a runny
fried egg to the sandwich stack. [BTW, it's messy even without the
egg - cut sandwich in half for easier eating]. Tempeh only keeps in
the fridge a couple of days. But it keeps in the free

Difficulty    : easy. Precision
: approximate measurements.
