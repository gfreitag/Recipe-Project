Yield: 6 Servings
2 TB oil
2 md onions -- 1/2-inch cubes
2    garlic cloves -- finely
chopped
:
2 ts ground coriander seeds

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the eggplant, cut-side down,
on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake 30 to 45 minutes, or until soft.
Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Alternatively, you can
grill the eggplant over hot coals. When cool enough to handle, peel
and cut the pulp into large chunks. This can be done a day or two in
advance and keptin the refrigerator. Heat the oil in a large saucepan
over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Then
add the garlic and continue cooking until soft but not brown, about 2
minutes. Add the eggplant, coriander, turmeric, and sugar. Cook until
soft and well combined, about 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the yogurt and
season generously with salt and pepper. Serve hot, warm, or at room
temperature.

Yield: 2 to 2 1/2 cups
