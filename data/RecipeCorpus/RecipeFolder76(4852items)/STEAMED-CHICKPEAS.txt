Title: STEAMED CHICKPEAS
Categories: Vegetarian, Appetizers, Digest
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Dried chickpeas (garbanzos)
8 c  Water
1 ts Salt garlic salt
Soak chickpeas for 6 hours in water.  Pour off water. Steam
chickpeas, for approximately 1 hour, maybe more, until tender and yet
chewy. Do not overcook to mushiness. Drain thoroughly, cool and
sprinkle with salt and garlic salt.

I used a rice steamer and the flavor of the chickpeas is totally
different (almost like a peanut) from the canned or the usual boiled
flavor. They were just del icious!

So just out of curiosity, I tried steaming a small handful of several
different beans, altogether (small red, kidney, black beans, lima,
navy, adzuki, pinto). (By the way, soak black beans separately, they
stain the white beans a very attractive shade of gray!) Same result!
I ended up just snacking on them by the handful. I never even got far
enough to use them for soup or something, they were so good by
themselves! This will be great for summer when it's too hot to cook!

Try experimenting with different spices (cumin, red pepper, cajun,
italian etc.).  I will probably never use canned or simmered beans
again, if I can help it. I'm definitely not a cooking purist, but the
difference with this steaming method is enormous! From Fatfree Digest
