Categories: Digest, Feb95

1 sm Package enoki mushrooms
5    To 6 large dried Shitake
Mushrooms
1 lg Can straw mushrooms
3    To 4 black fungus mushrooms
Or any variety of mushroom
You're comfy with--I
Used a dried version of
These and they became huge!
8 c  Water
1/4 c  Dry sherry or rice wine
1/3 c  Cider vinegar
2 tb Soy sauce
2    To 3 egg whites
3    Sliced scallions
1/4    To 1/2 tsp. white pepper
2 tb Cornstarch
Boil 2 cups of the water and pour it over the Shitake and fungus and
any ever other dried mushrooms you may have chosen. Let this sit in a
bowl for 30 minutes. When the mushrooms have finished soaking,
squeeze the juice out of them and cut them into bit sized pieces; do
not use the stems. Pour the soaking juice into a large soup pan with
5 1/2 cups of water. Bring the water and all the mushrooms EXCEPT the
enoki mushrooms to a boil.

Add rice wine or sherry, soy sauce and vinegar. Reduce the heat and
allow mixture to simmer for at least 10 minutes. (If you're trying to
get other dishes to come out at the same time, this is a good place
to just let the mixture simmer till you're ready for it!)

Mix the cornstarch and the remaining 1/2 cup of cool water in a cup.
Wisk the mixture into the hot soup... this is the possible lump
stage, but with all the mushrooms and egg whites, who will know?).

Drizzle the egg whites into the soup, whisking or stirring
constantly. Add the white pepper.

Wait 2-3 minutes and then dish up the soup, garnishing each bowl with
scallions and enoki mushrooms.  (These last add a lot of flavor!)
