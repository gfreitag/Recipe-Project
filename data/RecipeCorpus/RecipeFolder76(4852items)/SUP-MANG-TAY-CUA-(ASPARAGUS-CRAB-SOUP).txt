The French introduced asparagus to the Vietnamese, who promptly
incorporated this classic vegetable into their cuisine. The
Vietnamese word for asparagus is "Western bamboo," due to its
resemblance to bamboo shoots. asparagus is universally popular
throughout Vietnam, this light, tasty dish will delight your family
as well.

Bring water to a boil and put the pork bones in. Remove the scum, then
cover and continue to boil the bones for 1 hour. Remove the bones
from the stock and discard. Add the salt and the fish sauce to the
stock.

Heat the oil and add the chopped garlic and shallots; add the crab
meat and fry for 5 minutes over high heat. Sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon
of black pepper, stirring constantly, then add the crab meat mixture
to the soup and bring to a boil.  Add the cornstarch-and-water
mixture and stir for a few minutes.

Break the egg open and drop it into the actively boiling soup while
stirring.  Cook, still stirring, for about 2 minutes, then drop in the
asparagus, along with the liquid from the can and the rest of the
black pepper.  Continue to cook until the asparagus is heated through.

Sprinkle the coriander and scallion green over the soup before
serving.

Makes 6 to 8 servings.
