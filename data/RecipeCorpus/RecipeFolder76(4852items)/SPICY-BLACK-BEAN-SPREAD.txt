Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
1 c  Uncooked black beans
1    Bay leaf
1 sm Red bell pepper
1    Jalapeno pepper
3    Garlic cloves
1 ts Cumin
1/4 c  Finely chopped cilantro
1/4 c  To 1/2 cup vegetable or
-chicken stock
Salt and fresh ground black
-pepper to taste
Rinse and pick over the beans. Soak beans overnight in enough water to
cover. Drain and discard water.

Place beans in kettle. Cover with water and bring to a boil; add bay
leaf. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until very tender, 1 to 1 1/2
hours. Drain. Discard bay leaf. Set aside.

Roast jalapeno and red bell pepper in the broiler or over a gas
burner (or on a barbecue grill) until completely charred and
blackened on all sides. Place in bowl and cover with plastic wrap to
steam for 10 minutes. Remove from bowl and wash off all black outer
skin. Remove seeds and chop finely. (If you want a spicier spread,
leave in some of the jalapeno seeds.)

Combine beans, peppers, garlic, cumin and cilantro in a food
processor, and puree to a thick paste. Add enough vegetable or
chicken stock to make a spreadable consistency. Season to taste with
salt and pepper. Cover and chill.

Yields 2 cups.
