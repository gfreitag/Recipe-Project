water. If the clay gets too wet, sprinkle it with a little more flour
and squeeze again.Store the clay in a plastic bag until you are ready
to use it.
2... Cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil.  This will be your
work surface. Do all your modeling and drying on the sheet.
Directions for working with the clay will be given in each projcet

3... Finished objects can be dried in the air, on more quickly in
the oven. To air-dry your objects, place them on the foil covered
cookie sheet in the sun for a few hours, or let them dry overnight.
This way of drying is good for small objects.
4... To oven dry your objects set at low 225~.  Bake small thin
objects for about 15 minutes.  Bake thick objects for about 1/2 hour
each side.
5... After your objects have dried and cooled, they are ready to be
painted with felt tip markers.  To protect the finnish on your object,
brush them with two coats of clear nail polish after the colors are
dry. This will help the colors from coming off.
