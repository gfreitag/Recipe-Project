Title: SPICY BREAKFAST PATTYCAKES
Categories: Cakes, Breakfast
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/4 lb Ground turkey
1/2 c  Onion; minced
1/4 c  Fresh basil; chopped
1/4 c  Fresh parsley; chopped
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Thyme leaves; dried
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1/2 ts Dried red pepper flakes
Fresh ground pepper to taste
2 tb Dried bread crumbs
1    Egg, lightly beaten
2 tb Vegetable oil
1. Combine all the ingredients except the oil in a large mixing bowl,
and stir well but do not overmix. Cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour.

2. Shape the turkey mixture into 12 patties about
2-1/2    inches in diameter.

3. Heat the oil in a large skillet, and brown the patties over medium
heat, on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Then reduce the heat to
medium-low, cover the skillet, and cook, turning the patties
occasionally, until they are crisp and cooked through, about 6
minutes. (You may have to do this in two batches.) Serve immediately.
