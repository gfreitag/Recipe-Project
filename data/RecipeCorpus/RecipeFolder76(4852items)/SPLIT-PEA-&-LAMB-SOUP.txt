=======================================================
==================
1. Sort peas, discarding any debris. Rinse peas; drain, and set
aside.
2. In a 5-6 quart pan over high heat, combine celery, onion, lamb,
garlic, bay leaf, and 1/2 cup water. Cover and simmer rapidly for 10
minutes. Uncover, turn heat to high, and stir often until browned
bits stick in pan. Deglaze by adding 1/3 cup water and stirring to
scrape browned bits free. Stir often until liquid evaporates and
browned bits form again. Repeat deglazing step several more times
until vegetables are a rich brown, about
30    minutes total.
3. To pan, add split peas and 7 cups chicken broth; bring to a boil
on high heat. Cover and simmer until peas mash easily, about 1 hour.
4. Discard bay leaf. (You can chill soup atthis step, and continue
the next day.) Transfer 3 cups soup (but no meat) to a blender or
food processor. Whirl until smoothly pureed. Return to pan. For
thinner soup, add more broth. Stir on high heat until hot.
