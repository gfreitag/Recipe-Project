Title: SWEET & SOUR BEANS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 kg Green or butter beans
Salt
2 tb Oil
3 tb Plain flour
6 tb Vinegar
3 tb Sugar
Cook the beans in boiling, lightly salted water to cover. Make a roux
(see recipe for creamed spinach) with the oil and plain flour and add
the beans together with their cooking water, stirring constantly, to
make a thickish sauce (add more water if necessary). Add the vinegar
and sugar and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Taste and adjust if
necessary by adding more vinegar or sugar. Continue cooking,
stirring, for a few more minutes. Serve.
