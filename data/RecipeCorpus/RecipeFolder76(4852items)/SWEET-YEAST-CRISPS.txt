Title: SWEET YEAST CRISPS
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 5 Servings
1/3 c  Warm water
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 c  Lightly salted butter or
-margarine, at room
Temperature
1/8 ts Salt
2 c  All-purpose flour, sifted
-before measuring
3/4    To 1 cup granulated sugar
Combine the water and yeast in a small bowl; let stand for 2 minutes.
In a large mixer bowl, beat the butter and salt until creamy. Add the
flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. (This can
be done with an electric mixer at low speed.) Stir in the yeast
mixture. Cover the mixture and chill for 1 hour.

Place 3/4 cup of granulated sugar in a pie plate or shallow pan. Drop
level tablespoons of the chilled dough into the sugar. Roll each
tablespoon into a ball and coat well with sugar. Place the
sugar-coated balls in a shallow pan and chill for 30 minutes.

Heat the oven to 375F.  On a well-sugared board, working with one
ball at a time, press additional sugar into the dough while you pat
the ball into a square.  Using a sugared rolling pin, roll each piece
of dough into a square about 3 x 3 inches.  Cut each square
diagonally into two triangles. With a metal spatula, lift the
triangles onto an ungreased baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining
balls of dough.

Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Let the crisps
rest on the baking sheet for 30 seconds before removing them to wire
racks to cool completely.

The crisps taste best when fresh, but can be stored in an air- tight
container.

Makes about 5 1/2 dozen wafers.
