To make the pastry, mix together the flour and the salt. Using your
fingertips, rub the butter and shortening into the flour until the
mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Add water and knead lightly.
Form the dough into a ball, dust with flour, wrap in wax paper and
chill for 1 hour.

Roll the dough thinly and line 6 small tart pans. Prick the base of
the shells and chill for 1 hour.

To make the filling, melt the butter in a pan over medium heat and
add the scallions. When soft, add the spinach, nutmeg and pepper.
Cook for 5 minutes. Place in a bowl and beat in the cream cheese.
Separate the eggs, add 4 yolks, one at a time to the spinach. Add the
cream. In another bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff and fold them
into the spinach mixture.

Preheat oven to 400F. Cover the base of the tarts with wax paper and
dried beans or rice and bake for 15 minutes. Remove beans and paper
and allow the pastry sheels to cool.

Reduce the oven heat to 350F. Fill the shells with the spinach
mixture, dot with butter and bake 15-20 minutes. Allow to cool before
serving. Garnish with watercress and cherry tomatoes.
