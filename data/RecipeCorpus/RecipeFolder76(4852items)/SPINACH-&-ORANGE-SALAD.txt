10 1/2 oz Soft silken tofu

Silken Tofu: available in health food stores, made from extra-thick
soy milk, strained through silk. The liquid is not drained off. The
result is a creamy product that is ideal for spreads, drinks and
desserts. Silken tofu is vacuum-packed and has a shelf life of
several months.

Dressing: Place tofu in sieve; drain for 15 minutes, discarding
liquid. In blender or food processor, combine tofu, mayonnaise,
vinegar, tarragon, sugar, mustard, salt and pepper until smooth.

Spread almonds on baking sheet; bake in 350F 180C oven for 8 minutes
or until golden. Let cool. Meanwhile, tear spinach into bite-size
pieces.

In large bowl, combine spinach, oranges and onion. Toss salad with
half of the dressing. Sprinkle almonds over top.
