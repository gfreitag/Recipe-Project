Categories: Bar-b-q, Sauces

1    Garlic clove,peeled/minced
1/2 c  Green pepper,chopped

1. Heat bacon fat in a large heavy pot over low heat; saute onion,
garlic, and green pepper until limp. Add remaining ingredients, blend
well, bring to simmering, then lower heat and cook slowly until
thick. Remove and discard lemon quarters. This sauce keeps well in
the refrigerator, and Sybil often doubles the recipe to have on hand
to use whenever a barbecue recipe is called for. Heat well before
using. Baste over meat during last 15 minutes of cooking, and, if
desired, spoon over cooked meat before serving.

2. Excellent for chicken, spareribs, pork chops, hamburgers, hot dogs,
steaks and kabobs - just about any barbecued meat.
