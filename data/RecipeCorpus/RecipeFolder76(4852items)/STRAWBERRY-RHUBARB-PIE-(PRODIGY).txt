MMMMM---------------------FLAKY PASTRY DOUGH--------------------------
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Cake flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking powder
3/4 c  Unsalted butter
5 tb Cold water; or more
MMMMM-----------------STRAWBERRY-RHUBARB FILLING----------------------
2 pt Strawberries
1 1/2 lb Fresh rhubarb
1/2 c  Water
3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Fresh, strained orange juice
2 tb Grated orange zest
2 tb Orange liqueur
2 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Butter
MMMMM--------------------------EGG WASH-------------------------------
1    Egg yolk
1 pn Salt
FLAKY PASTRY DOUGH: Combine dry ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir
well to mix. Add butter and rub in finely, making sure to leave the
mixture cool and powdery. Stir in half the water, adding more if the
dough is dry and does not come together. Press the dough together
well, form into a disk, wrap and chill. After preparing the filling,
roll less than half the dough on a floured surface and fit it into a
9-inch glass pie pan. Pour in the filling and spread evenly on the
dough. Roll the remaining dough to a 12-inch disk and cut into
1/2-inch strips. Flour a cookie sheet or cake cardboard and arrange
half the strips on it horizontally, about 1/2-inch from each other.
Weave in the other strips vertically, again about 1/2-inch from each
other, to form a woven perpendicular lattice. Chill the lattice until
firm.

STRAWBERRY-RHUBARB FILLING: For the filling, rinse, hull and slice
strawberries. Rinse, string and cut the rhubarb into 2-inch lengths.
Bring the sugar, water, orange juice and zest to a boil in a
saucepan. Add strawberries and rhubarb and return to simmer, stirring
often. Don't overcook. Drain well and reserve 1 cup of the liquid.
Return reserved liquid to boil. Combine the liqueur and cornstarch
smoothly and stir into the boiling liquid, continuing to stir and
cook until clear and thickened. Allow to simmer 1 minute, stirring.
Stir in the drained fruit and the butter. Chill while preparing top
crust.

EGG WASH: Preheat oven to 375F and set a rack at the lowest level.
Whisk the yolk and salt together until liquid. Remove tart and
lattice from refrigerator. Paint lattice with egg wash and slide it
onto the surface of the filling. Trim away extra dough at edge of
pan, pressing the edges of the top crust well against the top edge of
the bottom crust. Bake about 30 minutes, until well colored and
gently bubbling. If top crust does not color sufficiently, place pie
on top rack of oven for 5 minutes. Cool slightly and serve warm or at
room temperature.
