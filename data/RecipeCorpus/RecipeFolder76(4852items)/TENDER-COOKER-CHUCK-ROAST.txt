Title: TENDER COOKER CHUCK ROAST
Categories: Beef
Yield: 8 Servings
1 tb Oil
3 lb Chuck roast
1/2 c  Water
1    Garlic clove, chopped
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1    Onion, cut up
3    Potatoes, cut up
1 tb Flour
Heat oil in medium sized skillet, sear meat on all sides; place meat
in Tender Cooker.  Add water, garlic, salt and pepper to skillet.
Heat and scrape off any browned meat; pour mixture over meat. Arrange
onion and potato on top of meat.  Place a single 7" circle of foil on
top of food. Cover and add regulator guage, microwave on high 30
minutes. Let pressure indicator drop, remove cover. Remove meat and
vegies, add flour mixed with a little water, stir, microwave,
uncovered, stir once, to thicken juices. (a 400-500 w oven needs an
increase of time of 6 min.)

That is their recipe - I don't do any of the above. My roast is
usually one with a lot less fat in in (as little as I can manage when
I cut a big piece of meat into roast, steak and stew meat) and is
almost always still frozen and so I don't brown it first.  I put the
meat and water in the cooker, cover and cook on high 20 minutes. When
the indicator drops, I add potatoes, onion, carrots, and such
seasoning as I want at the time, rinse the rubber ring, replace ring,
recover (with pressure cap) and micro on high for 10 minutes. Let
pressure drop, thicken juices and enjoy!
