Title: SWEET RED PEPPER RELISH
Categories: Relishes
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Very lge. red peppers,>>>>
Seeded & chopped (4 cups)
2 tb Coarse (kosher) salt
1 1/2 c  White wine vinegar
2 1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Mustard seeds, slightly>>>>
Crushed OR>>>>>>>>>
1/4 ts Fennel seeds
Mix chopped red peppers and salt and let stand overnight in a ceramic,
stainless-steel or enameled container, refrigerated.

Drain off and discard the liquid and put the peppers into a stainless
or enameled pot with the vinegar, sugar and mustard (or fennel)
seeds. Bring to boil, then lower heat to med. and cook, stirring
occasionally, until the peppers are translucent and the relish is the
consistency of marmalade, but syrupy. (If relish begins to thicken
too much before the peppers are translucent, cover pot and lower heat
for a few minutes while the peppers complete the necessary cooking
without too much evaporation.) Don't overcook, or a too-stiff relish
will result.

Prepare 4 half-pint canning jars with 2 pc. screw-on lids, and ladle
relish into each, leaving 1/2" headroom. Process in boiling water to
cover jars by 2" for 10 minutes.

Remove jars and cool.  Ready for use immediately.
