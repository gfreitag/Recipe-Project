Not many bakeries still offer a basic yeasted bread that's rich with
butter and eggs.  This one's delicious - a good bread to introduce a
friend or family member to the delights of whole grain bread. Mix the
water, honey, and yeast and let sit a few minutes. Add remaining
ingredients, adding whole wheat flour as needed. Knead dough well
until it is smooth and elastic.  Let rise, shape into loaves and
place in oiled pans. Let rise again and bake at 350F for 45 min. From
the Arcata Co-op Bakery. Makes 2 - 1 1/2 lb loaves. From: "Uprisings:
Whole Grain Bakers Book"
