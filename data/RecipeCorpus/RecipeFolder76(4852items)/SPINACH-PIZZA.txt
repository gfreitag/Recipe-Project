Title: SPINACH PIZZA
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 5 Servings
2    Or 3 whole Pita Bread
1    10oz pkg frozen spinach
1/3 c  Nutritional yeast
1 md Onion
5    Or 6 plum tomatoes
8 oz Pkg fresh mushrooms
3    To 4 cloves garlic
1 ts Each of the following
Spices: basil, parsley,
Cayenne pepper
1/2    To 1 cup rice milk
4 tb Flour
Thaw spinach completely, press out all water.  Heat milk in saucepan,
when hot but not boiling stir in flour. Stir until sauce begins to
thicken, turn heat down. Add nutritional yeast and spinach. Stir
constantly until thick and gooey, only about 3-4 min.

In separate pan, saute onion, garlic, until onion is tender. Stir in
tomatoes, mushrooms, and spices. Saute until just done. Preheat oven
to 425.  Using a very sharp bread knife, split each pita bread so
that you have two round flat pieces instead of one thick one. Place
each piece of bread on a cookie sheet or pizza pan. Spread spinach
sauce over each. Top with tomato mixture, being careful to avoid the
juice. Bake for 5 to 7 min.

Watch closely so that the edges of the pita don't burn. Makes a nice
crunchy crust.  This made enough for 5 individual pizzas. Sorry, I
don't have nutritional info.
