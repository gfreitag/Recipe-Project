Title: TAMATAR BHAT (TOMATO PILAF)
Categories: Indian, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
3 tb Light Vegetable Oil
1/2 c  Finely Chopped Onion
2 ts Ground Coriander
1 lb Red Ripe Tomatoes, Pureed
With Skin -- --or--
2 c  Canned Tomatoes -- pureed
1/2 c  Water
1 1/2 ts Coarse Salt
1 ts Black Pepper
5 c  Cooked Rice -- * see note
1    To 1-1/2 Cup  Water
3 tb Sweet Butter
Fried Potatoes (See Below)
Or--
Grated Or Sliced Daikon
Radish For Garnish --
(optional)
* preferably day-old basmati rice.

1.  Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
onion and cook, stirring until light brown (about 7 minutes)/ Add the
coriander and let sizzle for 25 to 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and
the 1/2 cup water, mix well, and cook over low heat, covered, for 15
minutes or until reduced to pulpy sauce.

2.  Add salt, pepper, rice, and water.  Gently mix to fold the rice
into the sauce.  Add butter and fold to coat the rice evenly. Cover
tightly and steam the rice over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or
until the sauce is absorbed into the rice.  If you are garnishing the
pilaf with fried potatoes, you can begin making them now while the
rice is cooking. Turn off the heat, fluff the rice, and serve
surrounded with fried potatoes or grated or sliced daikon radish if
desired.

Fried potatoes:

4 tablespoons light vegetable oil 1 pound potatoes, diced into
1/4-inch pieces with skin

Note: I finally added some ghee to brown the potatoes, the vegetable
oil just didn't do it alone.

Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat until it is very
hot. Add the potatoes and cook, turning and tossing, until they are
browned and cooked (20-25 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and
drain on paper towels.

Note:  I folded Spicy Mushrooms with Ginger and Chilies into the
Pilaf. It was very good the first day and exceptional the second day
