:

* Jicama is a Mexican vegetable root, the texture of a turnip or
potato but with its own unique taste. Peel jicama and cut into strips
about 1/2 by 3 inches long to serve with the coleslaw after it is
prepared and chilled.

Combine flour, sugar, salt, celery seed and pepper in pan. Stir in
vinegar gradually. Add water, mustard and onion. Cook over medium
heat, stir constantly. Cook until mixture thickens (don't undercook
or it will have a starchy taste). Stir small amount into beaten egg
yolks; stir egg yolk mixture into the hot mixture. Cook, stirring
constantly for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes more. Add margarine and stir until
thoroughly incorporated. Chill thoroughly. Fold in sour cream.
Combine cabbage, carrots and green peppers (red peppers if you wish).
Toss lightly to blend.
