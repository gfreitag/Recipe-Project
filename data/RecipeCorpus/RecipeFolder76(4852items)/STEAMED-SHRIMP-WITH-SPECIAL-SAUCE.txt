Title: STEAMED SHRIMP WITH SPECIAL SAUCE
Categories: Main dish, Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Large  prawns or shrimp
2 sm Red or green hot peppers
Seeded and thinly sliced
2 tb Light soy sauce
1 tb Hot peanut oil
Place the shrimp, shell still intact, in a bamboo steamer rack. Have
the water in the steamer boiling before you put the shrimp rack in
teh stamer. Steam until the shrimp change color and are hot all the
way through, about 6 minutes. In the meantime, clean the peppers for
the sauce by removing the seeds and slicing the pods. Place the
slices in a small dish and add the soy. Heat the peanut oil in a wok
until is it just smoking hot. Pour the oil into the peppers. Be
careful with this it tends to splatter. Serve the shrimp on a large
platter with the sauce in a dipping dish in the center of the
platter. Each guest will shell the shrimp and dip in the sauce
