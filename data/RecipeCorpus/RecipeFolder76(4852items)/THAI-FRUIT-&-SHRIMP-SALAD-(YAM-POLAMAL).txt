Cut the fruit into bite-sized pieces.  If using pomelo, peel the
individual sections and break them apart into grains about the size
of a grape seed. Toss apple or pear slices in a little citrus juice
to keep them from oxidizing.

Using a small skillet or saucepan, heat the oil over low heat and
gently fry the shallot and garlic in it until lightly browned. Remove
and drain on paper towels. Discard the oil or reserve it for another
use.

Combine the lime juice, salt and sugar (if used) in a medium bowl and
stir to dissolve.  Add the fruits, shrimp and half the garlic and
shallot: toss to coat evenly with dressing. Taste for seasoning and
adjust if necessary. Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with the
remaining garlic and shallot, peanuts and chile shreds.

Serves 4.
