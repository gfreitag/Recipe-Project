Title: TARAMOSALATA
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 8 Servings
3 sl French or Italian bread;-OR-
2 md -Potatoes, boiled & peeled
5 oz Tarama (fish roe)
1 c  Olive oil
1    Lemon's juice (or more)
2 tb Vinegar
1 tb Water (more if necessary)
1/2    Onion, (optional); grated
Soak the tarama in warm water a few minutes, then rinse and drain. If
using bread slices, discard crusts, soak bread in water, then squeeze
dry. Using an electric blender or electric mixer (or old-fashioned
mortar and pestle), thoroughly blend the bread or potatoes and the
tarama. Add the olive oil as slowly as possible, blending at medium
speed, plus a little water if the mixture forms peaks. Add the grated
onion, if desired, then whip at high speed for a few minutes. Note:
The flavor may be mitigated to suit taste by adding more bread or
potato; a too-salty taste may be adjusted by dropping in a few
tablespoons of sour cream while blending. Leftover taramasalata can
be stored in a covered jar in the refrigerator for 7 to 10 days.
