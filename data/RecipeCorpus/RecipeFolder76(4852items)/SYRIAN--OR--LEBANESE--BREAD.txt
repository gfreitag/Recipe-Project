Sift the 3 cups of flour with the salt. Add the yeast mixture. Knead
adding one cup water gradually to make a stiff, but not dry, dough.
Set in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk. Punch the dough
down. Divide into 6 to 8 round balls.  Place on a lightly floured
surface. With a rolling pin, flatten into 1/4 inch thick circles.
Cover with a kitchen towel and let it rise again for 15-25 minutes.
Brush with milk. Heat the oven to 500 degrees for about 15 minutes.

little cool, place them in plastic bags to soften. Excellent for
sandwiches.
