Separate ribs into single pieces and remove all excess fat. Heat
wok til smoking hot.  Add 2 T. oil, stir fry ginger and green onions
until aromatic.  Add rib pieces and stir fry until seared. Add black
beans and garlic and stir fry one minute, mixing well.  Add rest of
ingredients and stir fry one minute until meat is well coated. Simmer
uncovered about 30 minutes until liquid is reduced to a very thick
syrup, stirring frequently. When done, ribs will have a dark glazed
look.
Remove to a baking dish with a grid and keep in warm oven until
ready to serve.  Instead of ribs, you can use chicken wings or
drumsticks.
Serve on a platter with plenty of napkins.

the fermented beans don't make the dish. MM reformatting by Sandy
