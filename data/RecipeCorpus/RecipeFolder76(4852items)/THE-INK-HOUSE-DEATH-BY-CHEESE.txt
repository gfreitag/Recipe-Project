12    Eggs
1 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
2 c  Milk
16 oz Cottage cheese

The night before cut the cream cheese and jack cheese into cubes and
wrap tightly and refrigerate.

In the morning beat the eggs in a large bowl.  Add flour, baking
powder, salt and milk. Use a whip to be sure that all the flour is
absorbed. Beat in the cottage cheese (it will still be in small
curds). Stir in cubed cheeses. Make sure the cream cheese cubes don't
stick together. Pour into large coated baking dish. Dot evenly with
butter.

Bake at 325 degrees for approximately 45 minutes until puffed and
golden on top. Allow to cool 10 minutes and cut into 18 equal squares.
