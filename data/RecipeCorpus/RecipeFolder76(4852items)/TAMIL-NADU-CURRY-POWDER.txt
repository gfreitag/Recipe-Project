PREPARING GROUND SPICES ======================= To toast spices on the
stove top, place them in a dry, heavy-bottomed pan and cook them
briefly (5 to 7 minutes) over low heat, stirring occasionally, until
they darken and begin to release their aromas.  Heated mustard seeds
will begin to pop, and may jump out of the pan, so have a lid ready.
Oven toasting takes somewhat longer; spread the ingredients on a dry
cookie sheet and place in an oven preheated to 200 F; stir every five
minutes or so. Grind toasted ingredients to a powder with a mortar
and pestle, spice grinder, coffee mill (not the same one you use for
coffee), or a blender, the pass them through a fine sieve.
Transferred immediately to a glass container and stored away from
moisture, light, and heat, toasted and ground spices can maintain
their flavor as long as four months.
