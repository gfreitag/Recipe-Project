PASTRY:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

In a bowl, with a pastry blender, or in a food processor, blend or
pulse together flour, butter and salt until mixture resembles meal.
Add 4 tablespoons ice water and toss or pulse until water is
incorporated. If necessary, add remaining ice water to form a dough
and form into a disk. Lightly dust dough with flour and chill,
wrapped in wax paper, for
1    hour.

On a lightly floured surface roll out dough 1/8" thick and fit into a
9 1/2" round tart pan with a removable fluted rim. Prick bottom of
shell lightly with a fork and chill 30 minutes. Line shell with foil
and fill with weights. Bake shell in lower third of oven for 10
minutes. Remove weights and foil and bake shell until pale golden,
5-10 minutes more. Let the shell cool in the pan on a rack.

Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees.

FILLING:

In a large heavy skillet cook onions in lard over moderately high
heat, stirring, until very soft and golden, about 15 minutes.
Transfer onions to a bowl to cool. In a small bowl, whisk together
remaining ingredients and salt and pepper to taste and whisk in
onions.

Pour filling into prepared shell and bake in middle of the oven until
filling is set and top is lightly browned, 25-30 minutes.

Buen Provecho
