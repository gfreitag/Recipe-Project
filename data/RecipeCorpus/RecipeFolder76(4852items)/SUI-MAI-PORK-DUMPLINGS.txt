Categories: Appetizers, Pork, Chinese
Yield: 30 Servings
3    Black Mushrooms, dried
1/3 c  Bamboo Shoots, canned
1/2 lb Pork Loin with Fatback
1 ts Sesame Oil
1 ts Rice Wine or Dry Sherry
1 tb Cornstarch
1    Egg White
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Granulated Sugar
1/4 ts White Pepper, freshly

30    Won Ton Skins, defrosted
* The 1/2 lb pork loin should be ground with 1 ounce of fatback.

Cover mushrooms with boiling water and soak for 15 minutes.
Drain, trim and discard tough stem ends and finely mince caps. Blanch
bamboo shoots for 1 minute in boiling water; drain, pat dry and mince
finely.

In a large bowl, combine pork, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, sesame
oil, rice wine, cornstarch, egg white, salt, sugar and pepper until
well mixed. From into 30 1-inch balls. Trim the corner of won ton
wrappers to form circles; cover with plastic wrap to prevent them
from drying out.

To assemble, place a meatball in the center of each wrapper and
bring up sides, to form an open topped basket. Flatten the top of
each meatball with a butter knife dipped in water and flatten bottoms
of dumpling so they stand upright.  Place on a lightly oiled plate
and set in bamboo steamer or on an inverted heatproof bowl or trivet
set in a wok filled with 2 inches of boiling water.  Cover and steam
for 5 to 8 minutes or until done. Serve meatballs hot and garnish
plate with sprigs of fresh corianders. Makes 30.

Makes 30 dumplings.
