Title: STUFFED PEACHES
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
4 lg Peaches
2 tb Lemon Juice
1/4 c  Chopped Raisins
1 tb Honey
1 ts Vanilla Extract
1 ts Grated Lemon Rind
1/2 ts Ground Cinnamon
1/2 c  Low-Fat Yogurt
Scald peaches in boiling water for 1 minute to loosen skins. Drain,
peel, cut in half and discard the pits. Brush the fruit with lemon
juice to prevent discoloration. With a grapefruit spoon or melon
scoop, remove about half of the pulp from each peach, leaving a
sturdy shell. Brush the insides of the shells with more lemon juice.
Chop the pulp. In small bowl, combine the raisins, honey, vanilla,
lemon rind and cinnamon. Add the peach pulp. Fold in just enough
yogurt to bind the stuffing together. Divide the stuffing among the
peach halves. Serve immediately. From: "The Healing Foods Cookbook"
