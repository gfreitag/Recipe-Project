or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the
center comes out clean. Cool. 5. For the frosting, melt the
butterscotch morselsin a microwave oven on high for 45 seconds. If

boiling, water. 6. Mix the butter with the melted butterscotch. Add
the powdered sugar. Blend with a mixer until the frosting has a
smooth consistency. 7. Spread the frosting on top of the cooled pound
cake. 8. Cut the cake into nine rows. Then make two cuts lengthwise.
