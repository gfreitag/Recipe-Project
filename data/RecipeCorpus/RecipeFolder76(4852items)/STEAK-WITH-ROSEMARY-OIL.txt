Title: STEAK WITH ROSEMARY OIL
Categories: Main dish, Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
2 1/2 tb Olive oil
1 1/2 lb Well-trimmed boneless
-sirloin or rib-eye steak,
-cut 3/4 inch thick
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
4    Sprigs (3-inch) fresh
-rosemary, bruised with the
-back of a heavy knife
1. In a large heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. When it
just begins to smoke, season both sides of the steak generously with
salt and pepper and cook over moderately high heat for 3 minutes per
side for medium rare. Transfer the steak to a warmed platter.

2. Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil and the rosemary to the
skillet and stir frequently until the rosemary begins to color, about
1 1/2 minutes. Scrape the oil over the steak, garnish with the
rosemary sprigs and serve.

To complement the flavor of the rosemary, stick with Cabernet
Sauvignon, which has a hint of herbiness of its own and enough
acerbity to tolerate the bite of the saut E9ed cherry tomatoes. Among
a number of possibilities, consider the 1993 Chateau Montelena or the
1992 Burgess from California-or a Bordeaux, such as the 1992 Chateau
Leoville Barton.
