Title: TEA & LEMON ICE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 pt Strong fragrant tea *
2    Lemons
8 oz Sugar
1/2 pt Water
1    Egg white
6 tb Carbonated water
*Note: Suggested teas are Lapsang Souchong or Earl Grey.

In a Welsh household the kettle sits permanently on the hob ready to
refill the teapot.  This delicious ice makes a refreshing change in
summer. Or serve as a dessert with Welsh cakes or with a plate of
buttered Bara Brith. Makes approximately 2 pints.

Strain the tea and leave to cool.  Peel the lemons, avoiding the
bitter pith, and squeeze the juice. Bring the sugar and water to boil
with the lemon rind, stirring to dissolve all the sugar. Leave it to
cool. Beat the egg white lightly with the carbonated water. Mix all
the ingredients thoroughly with a whisk.

Freeze the mixture - an ice-cream-maker is best.  If you use the
ice-making compartment of the fridge, take it out when frozen, beat
it until it has doubled in volume, and re-freeze it. Don't serve the
ice rock-hard - transfer it to the fridge half an hour before serving.
