Title: SPINACH EMPANADAS
Categories: Pies, Vegetables
Yield: 60 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
16 oz Cream cheese, softened
3/4 c  Butter, softened
2 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/4 c  Onion, finely chopped
3    Garlic clove; minced
4 sl Bacon, cooked and crumbled
1 tb Bacon drippings
10 oz Spinach, frozen; thawed
-and drained
1 c  Cottage cheese
1/4 ts Pepper
1/8 ts Nutmeg, ground
1    Egg, beaten
In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter till smooth.
(Use a stand mixer, since the mixture is heavy.) Gradually add in the
flour and salt. Lightly knead the dough by hand. Cover with plastic
wrap and refrigerate for 3 hours.

In a medium skillet, cook the onion and garlic in the bacon drippings
until the onion is tender but not brown. Mix in the bacon, spinach,
cottage cheese, pepper, and nutmeg; let the mixture cool.

Preheat the oven to 450 F. Roll out the pastry on a floured surface
to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Cut 3-inch circles in the pastry, place 1
teaspoon of the filling in each circle, just to one side of the
center. Moisten the edge of the circle with the egg, fold the dough
in half over the filling to make a semicircular empanada. Seal the
edges with fork tines, and poke the top of each pastry with a fork to
make a vent. Put the empanadas on an ungreased cookie sheet, brush
their tops with egg, and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden.

Makes 60 empanadas.
