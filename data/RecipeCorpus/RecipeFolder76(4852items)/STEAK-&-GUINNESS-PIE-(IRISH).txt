Title: STEAK & GUINNESS PIE (IRISH)
Categories: Irish/brit
Yield: 4 Servings
1 kg Round steak
1 tb Flour
1 ts Brown sugar
1 tb Raisins (optional)
5 x  Onions
300 ml Guinness
8    Slices bacon
3 oz Lard
Chopped parsley
Recipe of short pastry*
*For double-crust pie in deep pie dish.  -- Cut the steak into bite
sized cubes, roll in seasoned flour, and brown in the lard with the
bacon, chopped small.

Place the meat in a casserole, peel and chop the onions, and fry until
golden before adding them to the meat. Add the raisins (if wanted) and
brown sugar, pour in the Guinness, cover tightly and simmer over a
low heat or in a very moderate oven (325-350F) for 2 1/2 hours. Stir
occasionally, and add a little more Guinness or water if the rich
brown gravy gets too thick.  Meanwhile, line a deep pie dish with
half the pie crust: bake it blind:  then add the Guinness/beef
mixture from the casserole, cover with the top layer of pie crust,
and bake until finished, probably about 10 more minutes.  Variation:
for the brown sugar, substitute 3 T honey. Re-Posted by Annette
