edges and along sides. Trim crust 1" higher than pan.  REFRIGERATE.
Roll remaining pastry and cut into lattice strips (3"wide).
Place on parchment lined sheet and refrigerate 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. FILLING: put rhubarb & strawberries in
large mixing bowl. Combine remaing ingredients in another bowl.
Sprinkle mixture over fruit. Turn fruit into prepared crust. Weave
lattice strips over filling, securing ends by pasting to crust with
dabs of water. Turn up overhang, trim, and crimp as desired. Bake
