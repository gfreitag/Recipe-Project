Categories: Soups, Crockpot
Yield: 6 Servings
-EILEEN LAMPARELLI
1 c  Yellow split peas
1    Meaty ham hock
2 qt Water
1/2 ts Dry mustard
4    Carrots; diced
1    Onion; diced
Salt and pepper; to taste
2 tb Dry sherry (optional)
Soak the peas overnight and drain.  Place in the crockpot along with
the ham hock, water, mustard, carrots and onion. Cover and cook on
LOW for 8 to 12 hours. When the peas are tender, mash lightly with a
spoon. Add salt and pepper and if desired the sherry. Heat about 30
minutes more. Sometimes I cook this overnight and just heat up when
it's time to eat.
