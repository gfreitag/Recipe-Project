Here are three recipes for flavored oils for various uses.

ROASTED RED PEPPER OIL:

Puree 1/2 cup roasted red peppers (homemade or commercial). Stir into
2 cups oil.  Let stand at room temperature until color and flavor are
pronounced, about 1 week. Strain and refrigerate. Use for dressings or
drizzled over pizza, pasta and shrimp. Lasts about 6 months.

Makes a little over 2 cups.

BASIL OIL:  From John Ash.

Blanch a bunch of basil (this will keep it bright green) and dry
well. Put in blender or food processor and add oil to cover well.
Blend and put in jar. Allow to settle; strain. Keeps refrigerated for
10 to 12 days. For using decoratively, put in little plastic squirt
tubes.

CHILE OIL:  From "From Pantry to Table, " by Mark Spieler.

Pour 1 cup oil over 2 tablespoons crumbled small hot dried chile
peppers or red pepper flakes, depending on heat of peppers and your
own taste. Some chiles (such as bird's eye) are incendiary and need
to be used sparingly. For more pronounced flavor, gently heat the
chile oil. A bay leaf or two may be added.  Drizzle onto pot stickers
along with soy sauce and a strong, sour vinegar.

Makes 1 cup.
