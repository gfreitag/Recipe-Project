Title: STEAMED BREAD PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Brown sugar
2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Seedless raisins
1 ts Vanilla extract
5    Thin slices good-quality
-white bread
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  (1/2 sticks) butter,
-softened
3    Eggs
In the top of an oiled double boiler, mix the brown sugar and raisins.
Remove crusts from bread, butter the slices on one side, and then cut
them into 1/2 inch cubes; you should have about 2 cups. Place the
cubes on top of the brown-sugar mixture.

In a medium bowl, beat the eggs lightly, then add the remaining
ingredients--just blend, don't overmix. Pour the egg mixture over the
bread cubes, but do not stir in. Cook, covered, over simmering water,
for about 1 hour and 20- minutes.  A knife inserted in the center
should come out fairly clean. (Pudding will continue cooking after
taken out of pan, so don't worry if it is still a bit shaky at the
end of the cooking time.)

Immediately loosen the edges of the pudding with a rubber spatula and
invert onto a 12 inch round platter with a lip. Arrange any stray
raisins decoratively around the edge of the platter. Serve warm.
