3 tb Milk
1 c  Plain Yogurt
2 tb Sugar
1/8 ts Salt
1/8 c  Sieved frozen Strawberries

Soak gelatin in milk, in custard cup. Set cup in boiling water; stir
until gelatin is completely dissolved.
Combine yogurt, sugar, and salt. Stir in gelatin mixture. Stir in
berries and lemon juice. Chill until slightly thickened; beat until
foamy. Fold in whipped cream. Pour mixture in metal ice-cube tray.

strawberries, well crushed. I then froze it in a Donvier ice cream
maker. Delicious!
