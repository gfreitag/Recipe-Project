Title: STEAMED CHERRY POUND CAKE
Categories: Dessert, Steamed foo
Yield: 10 Servings
1 pk Pound Cake Mix -- (16 oz)
2/3 c  -Water
2    Whole Eggs
20    To 30 Marachino Cherries
Drained
3 tb -All-Purpose Flour
Cherry Pound Cake 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours To  Cook: Turn the cake mix,
water, and eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric
beater on low. In a small bowl, combine the maraschino cherries with
the flour. Toss the cherries well in the flour so that all the
moisture on the cherries is absorbed. Pour the batter into a greased
and floured 2-quart mold or spring-form pan, Drop the cherries into
the batter from high enough up so they sink into it. (This maneuver
keeps all the cherries, which are heavier than the batter, from
sinking to the bottom of the cake.) Place the pan in the slow cooker
and cover with a loosely fitting plate. Cover the pot, but prop the
lid open a fraction with a toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess
steam escape. Cook on High for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. When a toothpick
inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, the cake is done.
Cool the cake on a rack for 10 to 15 minutes before you turn it out
of the pan. Let it cool thoroughly before serving. Makes 10 to 12
servings. "Clear & Simple Crockery Cooking", by Jacqueline Heriteau
