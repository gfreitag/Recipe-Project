Title: SPOT REMOVER
Categories: Laundry, Better
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------CHEAPER AND BETTER--------------------------
3 tb Hydrogen peroxide
1 ts Ammonia
** Especially good on delicate fabrics. This recipe is for a small
amount because you must use it and then discard any that might be
remaining. This cleaner will not keep and worse, IT WILL EAT THROUGH
ANY CONTAINER YOU PUT IT IN because the 2 chemicals generate heat if
left together for long.

Mix all in a glass or enamel bowl and dab on stained area. Leave on
for up to 1 hr, rinse off and reapply if necessary.

Hints: Fumes from this cleaner may seem strong, so work in a
WELL-VENTILATED AREA. Perform a PATCH TEST first. Dab a bit of
cleaner onto an inconspicuous part of the garment: inside seam. Wait,
make sure color doesn't run or babric doesn't seem badly affected.
Never combine this cleaner with any cleaner containing chlorine
