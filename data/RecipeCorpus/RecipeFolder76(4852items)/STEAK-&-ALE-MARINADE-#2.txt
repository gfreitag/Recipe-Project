The following is the recipe used in 1978 for the Hawaiian Chicken,
Club Steak, and Kabobs. I have included the original recipe for 64
chicken breasts or 48 steaks. The second recipe is the reduced
version we make for 12 chickens. Mix together well. Allow meat to
marinate a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 48. If holding the
meat longer than 48 hours, pour off the marinade. This recipe is for
12 chicken breasts. 1 c Soy Sauce 1 c Sherry Cooking Wine 1/2 c Red
