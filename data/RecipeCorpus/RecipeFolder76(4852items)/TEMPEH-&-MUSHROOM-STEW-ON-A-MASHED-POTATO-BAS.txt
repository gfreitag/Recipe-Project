Title: TEMPEH & MUSHROOM STEW ON A MASHED POTATO BAS
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Serving
1/3 c  Water
1 tb Soy sauce
1/2 c  Tempeh
1 sm Onion
1 sm Garlic clove
1 tb Vegetable oil
2 c  Mushrooms
1 sm Tomato
1    Bay leaf
1 ts Soy sauce (may be doubled)
6 oz Cooked potatoes (or more)
Soy milk; to taste
Vegan margarine; to taste
Seasoning; to taste
Bring the water and first amount of soy sauce to the boil in a small
pan, place tempeh (defrosted if frozen) in it, lower heat, cover pan
and simmer for 10 minutes; turn the tempeh over and simmer for a
further 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.

Chop the onion and garlic and saute in the oil for a minute or two.
Slice the mushrooms, add them to the pan and cook for another minute
or two.

Dice the tempeh.  Chop the tomato.  Add them to the pan, along with
the bay leaf and remaining amount of soy sauce. Cook, uncovered, for
about 5 minutes, stirring frequently.

Heat and mash the cooked potatoes with soy milk, margarine and
seasoning to taste (or alternately use a packet of vegan instant
mashed potatoes). Make a mashed potato base, remove the bay leaf from
the tempeh mixture, and pile it onto the base.
