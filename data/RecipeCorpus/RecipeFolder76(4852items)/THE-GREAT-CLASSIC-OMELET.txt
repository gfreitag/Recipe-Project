1 1/2 tb Olive oil
1 md Potato, very thinly sliced
4    Scallions, sliced
2 c  Fat free egg substitute
1/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Canned roasted red peppers,

Coat a large no stick frying pan with no stick spray. Add 1/2
tablespoon of the oil and warm over medium heat. Add the potatoes and
scallions and cook for 5 minutes or until potatoes are golden and
fork tender.

In a medium bowl beat together the egg substitute, water and peppers.

Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan and warm over low heat.
Add the egg mixture and cook for 1 minute, or until the edges begin
to set. Lift the edges with a pancake turner and tilt the pan
slightly to allow any uncooked mixture to run underneath.
