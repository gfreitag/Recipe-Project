-fat & minced or ground
1 c  Pork gravy
1 lb Potato; boiled, peeled &

2 T  Parsley; chopped
1/4 ts Thyme

1/8 ts Cloves, ground
1/4 ts Cinnamon, ground
1 ts Salt; or to taste
Roll out half the dough from the Butter-Lard Pastry on a lightly
floured surface to 1/8 inch thickness. Fold in quarters, lift, and
position in a pie plate. Trim a 1/2 inch overhang, brush with the egg
glaze, then refrigerate the pastry-lined pan while you prepare the
filling.

In a frying pan, saut the onion in the oil until transparent. Add the
garlic and saut 1 minute, then add the minced pork. Saut about 3
minutes, then add the veal (if you are using it) and saut until the
meats are browned. Break up any clumps with a wooden spoon. Add about
1/2 cup stock, cover the pan, and simmer about 15 minutes to cook the
meat through. Uncover the frying pan and check the liquid. Remove all
but 2 or 3 tbsp. of the meat juice and stock. Add the potatoes,
celery leaves, parsley, herbs and spices, and stir to blend. Add
salt, taste, and adjust the seasoning. Add, if necessary, just enough
additional gravy or stock to moisten the mixture well without making
it watery.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared pastry shell. Brush some egg
glaze on the overhang of the lower crust. Roll out the top crust on a
lightly floured surface, fold in quarters, lift, and position it over
the pie. Trim a 3/4 inch overhang, then fold the top edge under the
bottom crust overhang and pinch the two together to seal, making a
raised rim all around. Flute the edge as desired.

Bake in the lower third of a preheated 425-degree oven for 15 minutes.
Reduce the heat to 350 degress, raise the pie to the center of the
oven, and continue baking about 45 to 55 minutes longer until golden
brown. Check halfway through the baking time and add a foil edging to
protect the crust from overbrowning if necessary. Cool slightly on a
wire rack, then serve hot or warm.
