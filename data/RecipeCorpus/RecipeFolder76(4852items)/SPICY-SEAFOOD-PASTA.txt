Title: SPICY SEAFOOD PASTA
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Fresh pasta
1/3 lb Small shrimp
1/3 lb Bay scallops
3 1/2 sl Bacon
4 1/2    Shallots, minced
1 tb Sun-dried tomato paste
1 ts Powdered chile pepper or hot
Hungarian pap
5 oz Heavy cream
Boil sufficient water to cook the pasta. Dice the bacon into 1/4"
squares and cook over medium-high heat or until cooked and slightly
crispy. Add shallots and saute till clear. Turn heat to high and add
shrimp; turn. Add scallops when both sides of shrimp are pink;
stir-fry scallops and shrimp until mostly cooked, about three to five
minutes. During this time, add the red pepper.

Put pasta in boiling water (salted and oiled) and cover. Add cream to
shellfish-bacon mixture and keep cooking over high heat to reduce and
thicken the sauce. Add the sun-dried tomato paste and mix into the
cream while the cream reduces. When fairly thick (about the time that
the noodles are done), remove from heat. Drain noodles and place in
warmed serving bowl; cover with sauce, toss well, and serve with
grated parmesan cheese.
