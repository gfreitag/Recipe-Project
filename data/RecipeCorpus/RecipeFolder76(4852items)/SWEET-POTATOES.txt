Title: SWEET POTATOES
Categories: Entrees, Holiday
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/4 lb Sweet potatoes
-(canned or precooked)
2 c  Milk
3 tb Brown sugar
3 tb Butter, melted
1/2 ts Salt
1 ds Pepper
1 ds Cinnamon
1/4 c  Raisins
Marshmallows
Mash sweet potatoes by putting through a sieve or beating in an
electric beater or using a potato masher or food mill. Add milk
gradually (if you add it too fast it splashes and is hard to mix in).

Mix in remaining ingredients.  Put in buttered casserole. Heat through
(bake in slow oven 250 degrees F.) for 20-30 minutes, or in
microwave).

Cover top with marshmallows.  Return to oven until marshmallows are
slightly melted and a bit brown. (If the oven is too hot, the
marshmallows will disappear!) This step cannot be done in the
microwave.
