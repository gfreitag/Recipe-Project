PREPARATION:  For The Sauce, mix all of the sauce ingredients in a
small bowl and set aside.

For The Pork And Vegetables, dissolve 1 1/2 tsp of the cornstarch in
the chicken stock.  Set aside.  Slice the pork thinly against the
grain and rub with the remaining teaspoon of cornstarch. Cut the
broccoli into small florets and blanch in a large kettle of boiling
water until almost tender, about 3 minutes. Drain well and pat dry.
Cut the red pepper into 1/4-inch strips and set aside.  Thinly slice
the scallions, mince the garlic (1 tsp), and ginger (1 1/2 tsp); set
each aside.

COOKING:  In a wok or deep skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil until hot
but not smoking.  Stir-fry the red peppers and cashews until peppers
soften slightly and cashews start to brown, about 30 seconds; remove
and set aside.  Add pork and stir-fry until seared on both sides, or
about 1 minute; remove and set aside with the peppers. Heat the
remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, add the garlic, scallions, and
ginger, and stir-fry until fragrant, about 15 seconds.  Return the
peppers, cashews, and pork to the wok.  Immediately stir in the
broccoli, sauce and cornstarch- stock mixture.  Toss until sauce
coats ingredients and thickens slightly, about 45 seconds.  Serve
immediately with steamed rice.
