hickory in root beer for a unique flavor. Combine all the above
ingredients, blend well and pour over catfish fillets. Allow to set
at room temperature approximately thirty minutes. Smoke fillets for
approximately thirty-five to forty minutes or until flaky. Remove and
allow to cool. FOR TERRINE: Coarsely chop smoked catfish. In a two
quart mixing bowl, add all remaining ingredients, blending well to
incorporate seasonings into the mixture. Adjust salt and pepper if
necessary, and pour mixture into a terrine mold. Place in
refrigerator covered overnight. When serving, remove from mold and
garnish with French bread or garlic croutons. To enhance the
presentation of the smoked terrine, you may wish to color two cups of
mayonnaise, one with red food coloring and one with green. Using a
pastry bag with a star tip, pipe colored mayonnaise around the base
of the terrine. You may also wish to garnish the tip of the terrine
with a small amount of the colored mayonnaise and a fresh tomato rose.
