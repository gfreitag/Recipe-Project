Title: STRAWBERRY MILKSHAKE
Categories: Barry
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Strawberries, hulled and
-washed
2 tb Caster Sugar
4 oz Best Vanilla Ice Cream
1/2 pt Cold Milk
Take the ice cream out of the freezer a few minutes before you make
this to give it a chance to soften slightly. save two or three of the
prettier strawberries for decoration.

Puree the rest with sugar either in a liquidiser or by pushing the
strawberries through a sieve.

Add the ice cream and cold milk together and either process quickly
in the liquidiser or whisk until smooth.

Pour into glasses and decorate each with a slice of strawberry.

Chill in the fridge for ten minutes or so before watching this
disappear in far less time than it took you to make it!
