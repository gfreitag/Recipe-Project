Title: STIR-FRIED SCALLOPS WITH LEEKS
Categories: Oriental, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Fresh scallops
1 lb Leeks
1 1/2 tb Oil, preferably peanut
2 tb Scallions; coarsely chopped
1 tb Garlic; coarsely chopped
2 ts Fresh ginger; finely chopped
1/2 ts Salt
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
2 tb Dark soy sauce
2 ts Chili bean sauce
2 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
2 ts Sugar
2 ts Sesame oil
If the scallops are very large, cut them in half. They are cooked
when they are slightly firm to the touch. I find scallops at their
best when they are just barely cooked through.

DRY THE SCALLOPS WITH PAPER TOWELS and set aside. Trim the leeks and
discard any yellow parts. Cut the leeks at the point where they begin
to turn green and discard the green parts. Split the white parts in
half. Cut the white parts of the leeks at a slight diagonal into
2-inch segments. Wash them well, several times, in cold water. Heat a
wok or large frying pan until it is hot, then add the oil, leeks,
scallions, garlic, ginger and salt and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the
sauce ingredients and stir-fry the mixture for 3 minutes. Lastly, add
the scallops and continue to stir-fry for 4 more minutes, or until
the scallops are just cooked. Serve at once.
