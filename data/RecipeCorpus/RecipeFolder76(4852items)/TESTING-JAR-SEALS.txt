Title: TESTING JAR SEALS
Categories: Canning, Information
Yield: 1 Guide  After cooling jars for 12 to 24 hours, remove the screw bands and test
seals with one of the following options:

Option 1. Press the middle of the lid with a finger or thumb. If the
lid springs up when you release your finger the lid is unsealed.

Option 2. Tap the lid with the bottom of a teaspoon. If it makes a
dull sound, the lid is not sealed. If food is in contact with the
underside of the lid, it will also cause a dull sound. If the jar is
sealed correctly, it will make a ringing, high-pitched sound.

Option 3. Hold the jar at eye level and look across the lid. The lid
should be concave (curved down slightly in the center). If center of
the lid is either flat or bulging, it may not be sealed.
