Cook and drain the spinach, reserving the liquid i case you need it
for the dough. This may be difficult to roll out the first time
through a hand machine. Simply repeat until it rolls smoothly. Don't
be too quick to add liquid to the dough. If dough becomes too sticky
in the extruder, add a little more flour to mix if your machine
allows it, or dust with flour as it comes out to prevent sticking.
This recipe may be difficult to work at first. Notice it makes twice
