Puree chilies, coriander roots, Galanga, lime peel, garlic, onions
and shrimp paste. Add soy beans and rice flour and blend well.
Transfer the soy bean mixture to a bowl and add eggs, Kaffir lime
leaves, cilantro leaves and fish sauce and stir vigorously with a
wooden spoon until well blended. Heat oil in a large flat bottom fry
pan over medium heat. Meanwhile, dip hands in water and form the soy
bean mixture into patties, about 1-1/2 inch in diameter each. Fry
until well done and golden brown. Drain the oil on paper towels.
Serve hot with dipping sauce. Dipping Sauce ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Heat salt,
sugar and vinegar in a small saucepan over low heat until the salt
and sugar is dissolved. Cool a bit, add chilies and stir to mix well.
NOTE: The mixture must be on the dry side. If the mixture is
too soggy it won't be crispy when fried. The solution
would be to lay the patties out on a cookie sheet to
air dry about 15 minutes or so before frying.
