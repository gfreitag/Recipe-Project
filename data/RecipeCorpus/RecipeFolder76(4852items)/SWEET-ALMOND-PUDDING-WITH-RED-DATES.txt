Title: SWEET ALMOND PUDDING WITH RED DATES
Categories: Chinese, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
1/3 c  Sweet rice flour
2 tb + 2 t almond powder
1/2 c  Cold water
3 c  Cold milk
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  Sliced pitted red dates
3 tb Cold milk, if needed
This unusual dish as a dessert, as a mid-way course in a large
dinner, or as a snack.  Pudding may be misleading, since it is really
a thick, hot soup.

In small bowl, mix rice flour & almond powder; add cold water a
little at a time to make a thick, smooth paste. Thin further with 1/2
cup of milk. Pour into heavy saucepan, add remaining milk, and slowly
heat to just under boiling, stirring constantly.  Keep stirring to
prevent lumping & burning. Turn off heat, cover & remove to cool
place. You can prepare this first stage anytime ahead of dinner, keep
covered & refrigerated. Pudding should be finished just before
serving.

Just before serving, reheat pudding, stirring constantly. When hot,
add sugar a little at a time. Keep stirring. Add sliced dates. Cook
just under boiling point for 1 minute.  Add extra milk if pudding
becomes too thick: it should have consistency of melted ice cream.
Pour into individual bowls & serve hot.
