Mix sifted sugar into mashed potatoes, a little at a time, by hand;
do not use electric mixer. Sprinkle waxed paper with additional
confectioners' sugar; take ball of sugar-potato mixture, about the
size of a baseball, roll out as for pastry, and spread with crunchy
peanut butter. Roll over and over like jelly roll; makes enough for
two rolls, each about a foot long. Wrap in Saran or foil and chill
well. Slice into 1/2" thick rounds.
