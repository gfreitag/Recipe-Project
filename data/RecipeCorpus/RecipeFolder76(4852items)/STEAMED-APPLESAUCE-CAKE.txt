pot in a large pot with water to come about 1/2 way up the cans or
smaller pot.  Cover; cook for 2 3/4 to 3 hours at a simmer or till
cakes spring back when touched and a wooden tothpick inserted near
the centers comes out clean. Remove cans or pot from cooker; cool 10
minutes. Unmold cakes; remove waxed paper. Serve warm or cool with
whipped topping, if desired.
