Recipe by: Cheryl Mainard <cmainard@ARTIC.EDU> Cook vegetables and
garlic in the oil with the salt and cumin until soft. Let cool
slightly, then mix in oregano.

Roll out bread dough on a greased baking sheet into a rectangle about
15- by 11-inches.  Spread the vegetables and cheese down the middle
of the dough. Cut dough (using kitchen shears) on opposite sides in
diagonal 1-inch strips.  Fold in the ends, then fold the strips
toward the center, alternating sides for a braided effect. Cover with
a towel and let rise about
30    minutes.

Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Brush loaf with egg glaze. Bake until
golden, about 30 minutes.

NOTE:  This bread can be made 2 days in advance and served reheated
or room temperature
