Title: SUNDAY LOAF
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 18 Servings
3 c  Flour
1/2 c  Sugar
4 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
8 tb Butter, chilled
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Raspberry jam/preserves or
1/2 c  Strawberry jam/preserves
3/4 c  Milk
2 tb Butter
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Raspberry jam or
2 tb Strawberry jam
Servings: 18

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Combine the
flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir
with a fork to mix all dry ingredients well. Cut the butter into
small pieces and drop into the flour mixture. Using your fingers or a
pastry cutter, rub or cut the cold butter into the flour until
mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs. Beat the eggs well in a small
bowl, add the jam or preserves and milk; whisk until the mixture is
blended smooth. Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture and stir
only until no flour streaks show--the mixture wil be lumpy. Spoon
into the loaf pan and bake for about 1 hour 15 minutes, or until a
straw inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow loaf to remain
in the pan for 15 to 20 minutes before turning it out onto a rack.
Meanwhile, make the glaze by combining the butter, sugar, and jam in
a pan. Stir and bring to a simmer; continue stirring until dissolved
and blended. Strain and then spoon the glaze over the loaf after it
has cooled on the rack.
