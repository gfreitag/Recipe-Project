Categories: Pies, Pastries
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Flour
Confectioner's Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Cold Butter
1/3 c  Pecans -- finely chopped
1 c  Granulated Sugar
2    Eggs
5 tb Lime Juice
1 ts Grated Lime Peel
1/2 ts Baking Powder
Whipped Cream -- flavored
With rum
Preheat oven to 350 degrees

SIFT the flour, 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar and salt into a bowl.
Cut into the butter with a pastry blender (or with a whirl or two in
a food processor) until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the
pecans (they do not have to be ground, but a food processor is
excellent for chopping them very fine. ) PRESS the mixture into the
bottom and sides of a pie plate and bake for 25 minutes or until  the
crust is pale gold. Remove from the ove(keep it at 350 degrees) and
let cool while you prepare the filling.

TO DO THIS, beat the granulated sugar, eggs, lime juice and peel,
baking powder and a pinch of salt until smooth. Pour the mixture into
the pie shell and bake another 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and
let cool. When cool, sprinkle the top with confectioners' sugar put
through a flour sifter, and serve with dollops of rum-flavored
whipped cream. Makes 8 servings.
