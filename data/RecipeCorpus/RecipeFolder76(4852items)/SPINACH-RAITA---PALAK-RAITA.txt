Title: SPINACH RAITA - PALAK RAITA
Categories: Vegetables, East/orient
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Fresh spinach leaves
1 ts Salt
16 oz Plain yogurt
1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
1    Green chilli pepper
- fresh, hot
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
Rinse the spinach and cook very quickly in a saucepan until wilted,
with just the moisture remaining on the leaves and a little salt.
Immediately plunge the spinach into cold water to preserve the bright
green color. Drain well, then chop finely and stir in the yogurt,
black pepper and seeded chilli cut into very fine rings. Turn into a
serving bowl and, just before serving, sprinkle with the cayenne
pepper. from Favorite Indian Food by Diane Seed
