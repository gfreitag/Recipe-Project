8    Cabbage leaves

1 c  Quick-cooking white rice
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese

1.  Trim rib of each cabbage leaf very thin.  In 11" by 7" baking
dish, cook cabbage leaves and 2 tablespoons water, covered, on High 8
to 10 minutes until tender; drain. Set aside.

2.  In 2-quart casserole, cook oil and onion, covered, on High 3
minutes. Add mushrooms; cook, covered, 3 to 4 minutes until tender.

3.  On center of each cabbage leaf, place about 1/3 cup rice mixture.
Fold bottom of leaf over filling; fold sides toward center. Roll
tightly, jelly-roll fashion.

4.  In 11" by 7" baking dish, arrange cabbage rolls seam-side down.
Pour spaghetti sauce over cabbage rolls. Cook, covered, on High 8 to

Note:  I find that this was relatively bland, so I tend to add lots
more pepper and a bit more parmesan cheese to the mixture.
