Title: STEAMED CLAMS
Categories: Main dish, Fish, Appetizers, Microwave
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Steamers
1/4 c  Water
1. Place steamers and 1/4 cup water in a cooking bag. 2. Tie the top
of the bag with string. Do not use metal fasteners. 3. Pierce 3 holes
near the top of the bag to allow the steam to escape. 4. Heat in
Microwave Oven 6 minutes or until shells open. Tip: The live clams
can be placed in a shallow pan with enough water to cover. Sprinkle a
handful of cornmeal over them and let stand a few hours or overnight.
They will absorb the cornmeal into their systems and it will clean
out any sand as well as help in whitening the clam meat.
