Title: TANGY CRANBERRY BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Servings
1 tb Yeast
3 c  Bread flour
1/3 c  Cranberries, dried
2 tb Dry milk
1/2 tb Salt
2 tb Butter
3 tb Orange marmalade
1 1/4 c  Cranberry juice
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and

This is supposed to be great for Turkey Sandwiches. If using on
delayed cycle make sure the berries are placed where they will not
absorb all the moisture.
