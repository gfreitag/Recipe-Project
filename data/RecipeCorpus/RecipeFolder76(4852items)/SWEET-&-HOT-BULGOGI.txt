Title: SWEET & HOT BULGOGI
Categories: Korean, Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Flank meat sliced thin 1/4
-inch strips
1 sm Can crushed pineapple
1 bn Green onions (chopped fine)
1 sm Yellow onion (chopped
-coarse)
2 ts Black pepper
1 tb Hot chili sesame oil
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1 tb Brown sugar
1    Clove garlic (diced fine)
1 lg Carrot (shredded)
Mix all ingredients in a large mixing bowl (including juice from
pineapple). Let it marinate overnight or minimum 8 hours. Saute over
med high heat in large skillet or wok until meat is lightly browned.
Ensure the juice is added during cooking.This batch should take two
trips to the stove to cook. I like it served over the wide crispy La
Choy noodles.(my friend prefers the noodles) I would use steamed
rice...
