Title: STEWED FRUITS
Categories: Crockpot, Desserts, Fruits, Harned 1994
Yield: 1 Batch
1 lb Prunes; pitted
8 oz Dried apricots
8 oz Dried pears
3 c  ;Water
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2    Vanilla bean
2    Lemon zest strips, 2" each
2 tb Freshly squeezed lemon juice
Stir all ingredients together in a large heavy saucepan. Bring the
liquid to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to as
low as possible and cook, covered, until the fruit is softened and
tender, 2 hours. Stir the fruits occasionally while they cook.

If you have a crockpot, stir all the ingredients together in it and
cook until the fruit is tender, 6 to 8 hours.

Serve the fruit warm or at room temperature.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

Loomis says that the crockpot method is preferable, for depth of
flavor. She suggests serving this as brunch by itself, over waffles
or pancakes, or for dessert over vanilla or cinnamon ice cream. Or,
eat this on its own for a sweet snack.
