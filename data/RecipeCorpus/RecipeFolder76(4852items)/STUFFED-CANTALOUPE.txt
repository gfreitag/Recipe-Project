Title: STUFFED CANTALOUPE
Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Cantaloupe, medium
White or rose wine
1/4 lb Blue cheese, crumbled
1/2 lb Ricotta or farmer's cheese
1/4 c  Sour cream or heavy sweet
-cream
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper
Cut a slice off the top of the cantaloupe, scoop out the fruit with a
melon-ball cutter. Marinate the melon balls in wine until time to
serve. In the meantime, blend together cheeses and cream. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. Pile the cheese mixture lightly into the
cantaloupe shell. If it does not fill the shell lower the rim of the
shell by cutting with knife in jagged edges to form a "basket edge."
To eat, spear melon balls with toothpicks, and dip them into the
cheese mixture for a very pretty, refreshingly different appetizer.
Makes about 1 cup cheese mixture and about 20 melon balls.
