* For the mixed herbs, use fennel, thyme, marjoram, oregano, rosemary
and/or parsley. (If you don't have fresh herbs, substitute a mix of 3
Tbs blended dry herbs with 1/4 cup minced fresh parsley.) ** You may
substitute
1/4    tsp ground sage.

Place meats and eggs in a large bowl. With an electric mixer fitted
with paddle, or by hand, beat for 2 minutes. Add all ingredients
except bay leaves and chili sauce, and mix thoroughly. Turn mixture
into a roasting pan and firmly pack meat forming it into a long loaf
4 to 6 inches wide and 4 to 5 inches high. Place bay leaves on top.
Cover and chill for at least 2 hours. Remove from refrigerator 1 hour
before roasting. Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake meat loaf for 45
minutes. Increase oven temperature to 425 F and bake for 40 minutes
more. Serve with chili sauce. Makes 8 to 10 servings.

NOTE: As with many meat loaf recipes, you can personalize this by
substituting ground pork, more seasonings and a tsp of cayenne for
the hot sausage.
