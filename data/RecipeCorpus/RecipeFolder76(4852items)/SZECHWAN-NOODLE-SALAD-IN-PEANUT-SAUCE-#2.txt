To make peanut sauce, combine ginger, garlic, 1 tablespoon green
onion, peanut butter, soy sauce, vinegar, chili paste, sugar, sesame
and vegetable oils, sherry, dry mustard, salt and chicken stock.
Blend thoroughly. Cover and set aside. Do not refrigerate.

To make noodles, cook fettuccini until tender. While noodles are still
warm, toss with oil until well coated. Chill. Place carrots in sieve
and pour boiling water over them. Immediately pat dry with paper
towels and chill. Wrap julienned green onions, ham, bean sprouts,
cucumber and red pepper separately and chill until serving time.
Bring noodles to room temperature before serving. At serving time,
place noodles in center of large round bowl or platter. Arrange
vegetables and ham attractively in separate mounds around edge. Blend
peanut sauce again and pour over noodles, vegetables and ham. Toss.
