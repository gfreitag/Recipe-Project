Title: STRAWBERRIES & RICE
Categories: Rice, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Milk
1 tb Gelatine
1/2 c  Rice (uncooked)
1/2 c  Cold Water
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Lemon Juice
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Cream
Heat the milk in double boiler. Add rice, well washed, and salt and
cook until the rice is tender, and the milk is nearly all absorbed.
Stir in carefully the sugar and add gelatine which has been softened
in cold water and dissolved over steam. When the mixture is partly
cold, add lemon juice and when it is  beginning to set stir in
lightly the cream which has been whipped. turn into a wet mold and
set on ice to cool. Turn out and serve with strawberry sauce.

These are rather fun, but now we have to call the iceman.

I've looked to no avail, there is no recipe in the book for Strawberry
sauce. It may have been so common that everyone knew how to make it?
But we will give you some pudding...
