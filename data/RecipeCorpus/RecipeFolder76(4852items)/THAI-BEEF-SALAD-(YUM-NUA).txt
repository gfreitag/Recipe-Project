Title: THAI BEEF SALAD (YUM NUA)
Categories: None, Thai
Yield: 1 Servings
500 g  Fillet beef
Mixed lettuce, cucumber
-and red chillies, arranged
-on a plate
1 c  Fish sauce
2 tb Light soy sauce
4 tb Chopped fresh coriander
2 tb Chopped fresh basil or mint
Juice of two limes
Fry or roast the fillet to 1 below your preferred degree of doneness.
While that's happening, process most of the herbs, the lime juice and
the fish and soy sauces together. Leave some of the herbs for use as
a garnish.

When the meat is cooked, slice it thinly. Put the herb mix in the pan
and heat through. Add the sliced meat, and simmer or a few minutes.
Laty the meat on the salad, and spoon the sauce over it. Sprinkle the
remaining herbs and some sliced chillies on top.

Great with jasmine rice, not bad with couscous or bread.
