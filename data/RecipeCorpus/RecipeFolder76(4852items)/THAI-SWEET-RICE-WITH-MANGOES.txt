GLUTINOUS RICE: Glutinous or sweet rice is a white, short-grained
rice that has a sticky consistency when cooked. It can be found in
Asian markets and many markets with asian specialty sections. CANNED
COCONUT MILK: Canned coconut milk also is sold in Asian markets and
some supermarkets with Asian specialty sections. Do not confuse this
product with the water inside the coconut. SHORTCUT: A Japanese rice
cooker can make short work of cooking the glutinous rice. Rather than
soaking the rice, rinse it 3 times in cold water and drain.  Cook
rice according  to manufacturer's directions. PROCEDURE: Cover rice
with water and soak at least 6 hours or overnight (see shortcut). A
couple of hours or so before serving, drain rice and spread on a
cheesecloth-lined section of a steamer; steam for 45 minutes. During
the steaming, sprinkle the rice 2 times with 1/4 cup water.
Meanwhile, over medium heat using a Dutch oven or large saucepan,
simmer the coconut milk on medium-low heat until it is reduced by
one-third in volume.  Use caution toward the end of simmering,
because the coconut milk can sen spouts of liquid 2 or 3 inches above
the pan toward the end of the simmering time if it is too hot. Remove
from heat and stir in sugar and salt. When rice is finished steaming
and has rested for 10 minutes, blend it with the warm, sweetened
coconut milk; allow to stand for 10 minutes. Immediately arrange rice
on platter and place mango on top. Serve.
