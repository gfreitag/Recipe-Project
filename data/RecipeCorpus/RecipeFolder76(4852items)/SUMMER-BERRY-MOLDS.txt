cheesecloth-lined strainer into a bowl. Pour 1/2 cup beryy juice into
top of a double boiler (not over heat). Sprinkle gelatin over; let
stand to soften, about 5 minutes. Set over simmering water, whisk
until gelatin dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; add
remaining berryjuice. Divide 1 1/4 cups berries among six 6-ounce
ramekins. Pour gelatin mixture into ramekins over berries; cover with
plastic wrap; refrigerate until set, about 4 hours. Meanwhile, make
berry sauce: cook reserved berry solids, remaining 2 tablespoons
sugar and 1/4 cup water in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring
occassionally, 5 minutes. Press mixture through a sieve. To serve,
place a meringue on a plate. Unmold gelatin by dipping ramekin
briefly in hot water and running a knife tip around the edge; invert
onto meringue, and top with another meringue. Garnish with berries
and serve berry sauce on the side.
