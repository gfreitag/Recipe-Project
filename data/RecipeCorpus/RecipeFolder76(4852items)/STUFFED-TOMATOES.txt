:30 Scoop out tomatoes carefully. Toast bread and cut into 1" cubes.
Pour 2 tsp anchovy oil (from can) onto bread, mash anchovies and mix
with bread cubes and inside of tomatoes. Add lots of parmesan cheese
(approx 1/4 cup) to prevent mixture from getting too wet and soaking
up too moisture from inside of tomatoes). Stuff tomatoes with
mixture. Sprinkle parmesan on top. Put in square pan, surround with
1/2" water. Bake 30 minutes at 375F. Mom's recipe originally
