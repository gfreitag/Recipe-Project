Categories: Italian, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Artichokes; large
1    Lemon
4    White bread; slices
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/3 c  Parsley; chopped
3    Garlic cloves; chopped
Salt & pepper; to taste
Water
4 tb Olive oil
Cut off artichoke stems; slice and reserve.  Remove and discard hard
outer leaves of artichokes.  Cut sharp tips off remaining leaves with
scissors. Slice off about 1/2 inch from top end of each artichoke.
Open artichokes gently with your hands.  Remove fuzzy chokes with a
knife or melon-baller. Wash artichokes under cold running water.
Slice lemon in half and rub over cut tops of artichokes.  Set
artichokes with cut part down on paper towels. Remove crusts from
bread. Chop bread into small pieces and place in a medium bowl. Add
1/2 cup oil, parsley, garlic and salt and pepper. Mix well.  Arrange
mixture between artichoke leaves and in centers. Place artichokes and
reserved stems in a large saucepan. Pour water about 1 inch deep in
pan. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons oil. Bring water to a boil. Reduce heat
to medium and cover pan.  Cook artichokes 40 to 60 minutes, depending
on size.  If water evaporates, add a little more. There should be 4
to 5 tablespoons of sauce left in pan.  If too much liquid is left,
uncover pan and boil liquid down. Spoon sauce over artichokes and
stems. Serve hot. Makes 4 servings.
