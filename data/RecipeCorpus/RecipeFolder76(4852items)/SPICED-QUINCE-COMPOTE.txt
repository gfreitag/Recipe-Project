Title: SPICED QUINCE COMPOTE
Categories: Fruits/nuts, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 qt Water
2 lb Ripe (bright yellow) quinces
1 c  Sugar
1/2    Vanilla bean
- split lengthwise
1    Cinnamon stick (2-inch)
4    Cloves
1/8 ts Cardamom seeds
2    Wide strips orange peel
PUT THE WATER IN A SAUCEPAN to heat. Rinse the quinces, then using a
sharp paring knife, quarter the fruits. Carefully cut out the cores.
Hold each piece firmly as you work so that it doesn't snap in 2.
Slice each quarter into pieces about 1/2-inch thick, then cut away
the peels. As you work, put the cores and peels in the pan of
water--they will impart both flavor and body to the water, due to the
natural pectin in the fruit. Allow the skins and cores to simmer
slowly, covered, for about 20 minutes, then strain, keeping the
liquid. Don't worry about the peeled fruit discoloring--it will turn
pink when cooked. Combine the sugar, spices, orange peel and the
strained liquid in a non-corroding pan. Bring to a boil, stir to
dissolve the sugar and add the quinces. Cut out a disk of parchment
paper and place it directly on the surface to prevent any exposed
slices from drying out. Simmer slowly until the quinces have turned
pink and are slightly translucent but still firm to the touch, 2-to-2
1/2 hours. When done, transfer them to a bowl with the syrup and
chill well before serving. Once poached in syrup, quinces will last
for weeks in the refrigerator. Makes 1 Quart
