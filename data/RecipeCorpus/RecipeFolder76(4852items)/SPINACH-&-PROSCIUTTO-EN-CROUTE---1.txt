Recipe by: The Uncommon Gourmet by Ellen Helman A pastry turnover
encasing a spinach, cheese, olive, and prosciutto filling, baked
until golden. This hors d'oeuvre gets a 5-star rating in our home -
it's my husband's favorite.

1. Mix together the oil, garlic, black pepper, and Parmesan. Cover and
marinate for 2 to 3 hours.

2. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured board to form a rectangle
12x20- inches. (Pinch any seams together so that you essentially
have one large piece of dough.) Chill for 30 minutes.

3. Squeeze the spinach of all its liquid. Spread the spinach down the
center of the length of the dough forming a layer 4 inches wide and
extending to within 1-inch of either end.

4. Cover the spinach with half of the Swiss cheese. Blanket the cheese
with even layers of prosciutto. Spoon the marinade over the ham.

5. Sprinkle the remainder of the Swiss cheese over the prosciutto. Top
everything with black olives.

6. Fold the dough like a turnover, overlapping the sides. Crimp the
ends together firmly to seal. Place seam side down on an ungreased
baking sheet.  (Up to this point may be prepared 2 to 4 hours in
advance and refrigerated.  Return to room temperature to bake.)

7. Beat the egg and water together. Brush the pastry with the egg
wash.
This gives the loaf a golden glaze when baked.

8. Bake in a preheated 350F degrees oven for 30 minutes. Transfer to a
platter, cut into 1 and 1/2-inch wide slices, and serve
immediately.
