Title: STUFFING - BREAD LF
Categories: Low-cal, Side dishes
Yield: 12 Servings
3/4 c  Onion finely chopped
1 1/2 c  Celery (with leaves) chopped
1 c  Butter Buds
(or margarine/butter)
9 c  Bread cubes - soft
2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Sage
1 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Pepper
(Allow 3/4 cup stuffing for each pound of ready-to-cook chicken or
turkey. A 1- to 1 1/4 pound Rock Cornish hen requires about 1 cup
stuffing. Allow 1/4 to 1/3 cup stuffing for each rib pork chop and
about 1/2 cup per pound of dressed fish. This recipe makes enough for
a 12-pound turkey.)

Cook and stir onion and celery in Butter Buds (or margarine/butter) in
10-inch skillet until onion is tender. Stir in about 1/3 of the bread
cubes. Turn into deep bowl. Add remaining ingredients; toss. Stuff
turkey just before roasting. If desired, bake the stuffing mixture
separately in a casserole, covered, in a 325 degree F oven for 40 to
45 minutes or in a 375 degree F oven for 20 to 30 minutes.

Stuffing temperatures should reach at least 165 degrees F. To check,
insert a meat thermometer through the body cavity into the thickest
part of the stuffing and let stand for 5 minutes.

Oyster Stuffing: Decrease bread cubes to 8 cups and add 2 cans (8
ounces each) oysters, drained and chopped, with the remaining
ingredients.

Makes 9 cups stuffing.
