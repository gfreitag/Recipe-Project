and pepper to taste Quiche Crust, baked, cooled

* defrost spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; it
should be fairly dry. ** cheese is better if fresh-grated.

Mix the eggs, cream, and milk.  Add the salt and pepper, lemon juice,
and parsley. Stir in the spinach and feta cheese. Fill the quiche
crust, and place the Parmesan on top.

Bake at 375 F. for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the
center comes out dry. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Can also be served at room temperature.
