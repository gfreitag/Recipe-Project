Title: TARAMOSALATA (TARAMA SAUCE)
Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 1 Servings
6 oz Tarama (cod roe)
8 sl White bread, trimmed
1 1/2 c  Best olive oil (more if need
2    Lemons, juiced (or to taste)
1    Sm. onion, chopped fine
Parsley, chopped (opt.)
Chives, chopped (opt.)
Put the tarama in a mixer or blender.  Wet the bread and thoroughly
squeeze out the excess water; add to the tarama. Add a little oil,
and beat until thoroughly blended. Add onions and continue to mix.
Pour additional oil slowly into the tarama, beating constantly, to
make a smooth, cream-colored paste. Add lemon juice, a little at a
time, to taste. The consistency and taste of the taramosalata are a
matter of individual preference.  Some prefer it made with a little
more bread; others like more lemon juice, some like less. No matter:
the end result is always a tasty, rather thick, versatile diplike
sauce.  Serve it in a bowl, with crackers or crusty bread, onion
slices, etc., to "go with." Or garnish with parsley and olives for a
festive platter.  Or use as salad dressing.

NOTE:  Taramosalata in generally placed on the Greek table at the
start of the meal and can be tasted at will throughout the meal.
