Title: TEXAS SKILLET CORN BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 8 Servings
1/4 c  Bacon drippings or oil
1 c  Yellow cornmeal
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1 tb Sugar (optional)
1 c  Buttermilk
2    Eggs, slightly beaten
Heat bacon drippings in a large well-greased black iron skillet. In a
large mixing bowl, mix cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, soda and
sugar. Add buttermilk and stir rapidly.   Add eggs and mix.  Add hot
drippings and stir rapidly.  Pour batter into lot skillet (see note),
cover, reduce heat. Cook on top of stove until bread is lightly
browned and almost cooked through -- enough that you can turn the
corn bread easily with a wide spatula or pancake turner -- about 5 to
6 minutes. Turn and brown on other side, about 2 minutes. Cut into
wedges to serve. Makes 6 to 8 servings Note: If you have an electric
range, heat two burners -- one hot, the other on low.  When you pour
the batter into the hot skillet, move immediately to low-heat burner
to finish.
