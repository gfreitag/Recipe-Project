Title: THAI SIMMERED CHICKEN
Categories: Thai, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Chicken (4 to 5 pounds)
Salt
2 qt Water
3    Stalks fresh lemon grass
8 sl Fresh galangal (or fresh
-ginger)
6    Garlic cloves, smashed
6    Fresh Thai "bird" chiles *
8    Shallots, sliced
6    Fresh kaffir lime leaves
-(optional)
1/4 c  Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
1/2 ts Sugar
1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
1/2 c  Tightly packed fresh
-coriander leaves
1/4 c  Fresh Thai basil leaves,
-cut into thin strips
1 ts Black pepper
* (or 4 Serranos), cut into coarse strips, seeds and all.

Salt the chicken inside and out and let stand for 30 minutes to an
hour.

In a pot the chicken will fit in snugly, bring water to a boil. Add
the chicken and when the water returns to a boil, skim the foam. Cut
off the bottom 1/3 of the lemon grass stalk, discarding the rest. Cut
the bottom on the bias into oval slices and add to the pot along with
the galangal, garlic, chiles, shallots and kaffir lime leaves (if you
can find them).

Turn the heat to medium-low, partially cover the pot, and simmer for
30 minutes.  Then add the fish sauce, sugar and up to 2 teaspoons of
salt (or to taste). Simmer until the skin near the wing starts to
split, about 30 more minutes, then remove the chicken to a large,
round serving bowl leaving the stock in the pot. Cover the chicken to
keep warm.

Add the lime juice to the broth as well as the coriander and basil
leaves. Pour the broth over the chicken, sprinkle with the black
pepper and serve.

The chicken should pull off the bone easily; it's best eaten from
bowls with some of the broth and herbs poured over.
