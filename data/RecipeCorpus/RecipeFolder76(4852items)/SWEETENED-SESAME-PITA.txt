1 ea Recipe basic pita prepared
-- as far as the kneading
3/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Cold water
1 c  Sesame seeds
Shape kneaded dough into an even rectangle & cut in half lengthwise.
Divide into 12 equal portions.  Shape each portion into a smooth ball
& place on a floured surface. Cover with damp towels & let rest in a
warm place for 30 to
45    minutes. 15 minutes before they finish rising, preheat
oven to 425F & lightly grease a baking sheet. Blend sugar with cold
water until you have a thick paste. Add more water if necessary. Set
aside. Working on 2 balls at a time, press each ball flat. Roll out
each round to a 7" circle. Place two rounds on the baking sheet.
Spread the sugar paste evenly over the top of each round. Sprinkle
with 4 ts of sesame seeds. Press down to ensure that the seeds stick.
Score each pita into 8 wedges. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove
from oven, separate the wedges & cool on wire racks. Note, these
pitas do not puff.
