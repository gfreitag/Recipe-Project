If you don't like coriander, use basil or mint instead. For a spicier
dish, increase the chili sauce.

In a blender or by hand, combine coriander, chili sauce, soy sauce,
oyster sauce, garlic and sugar. Spread on chicken and marinate for 4
hours or overnight.

Preheat broiler or barbecue. Broil chicken skin side down for 4
minutes. Turn and broil 4 minutes longer until skin is crispy and
chicken is cooked through. Cut chicken in 1/2-inch strips.

Place lettuce leaves on platter and arrange chicken on top. Carnish
with coriander, mint sprigs and green onions.

To eat in the Thai manner, roll chicken in lettuce leaves along with
herbs and onions. Dipp into dipping sauce. Alternatively, serve
lettuce, chicken and garnishes together.

Tart Sweet Dipping Sauce Tbis is the traditional Thai dipping sauce
used for salad rolls, spring rolls and most everything else.

Combine sugar, water and vinegar. Bring to boil and boil for 5
minutes. Stir in garlic, fish sauce and chili sauce. Simmer for 2
minutes. Cook and add lime juice and shredded carrot.
