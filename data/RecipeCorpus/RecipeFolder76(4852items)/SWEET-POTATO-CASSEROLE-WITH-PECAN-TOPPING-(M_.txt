Peel and slice sweet potatoes into 1/4 inch slices. Cook in water and
drain and mash.  (I prefer to bake mine.) Beat with electric beaters,
stopping every so often to remove any strings that may collect on
beaters. Add butter and sugar to warm potatoes and continue mixing.
Add milk, vanilla and eggs.  Mix well and put in a buttered casserole
dish about 8" x 12". Mix the Pecan Topping ingredients and crumble
over top of casserole. Bake 30 minutes at 350 .  Freezes well before
or after cooking. Serves 8-10.
