Categories: Cookies
Yield: 36 Servings
8 oz Cream Cheese, Softened
1/2 c  Butter
2 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
3 tb Butter, Melted
1 c  Finely Chopped Walnuts
3 tb Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
Yield:  About 36 Cookies

Mix the cream cheese, butter, and flour together, blending well.
Chill to firm the dough.  Roll out about 1/3 of the dough, on a
floured board, into a 12-inch circle. Brush with 1 Tbls of melted
butter. Combine the walnuts, sugar and cinnamon, blending well, and
sprinkle one-third of the mixture onto the dough. Cut into 12 long
triangles and roll up, starting at the outside, so that the point of
the triangle is on the outside. Repeat with the rest of the dough and
sugar mixture. Place on ungreased cookie sheets and bake in a
preheated 350 Degree F. oven for about 10 to 15 minutes, until
lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
