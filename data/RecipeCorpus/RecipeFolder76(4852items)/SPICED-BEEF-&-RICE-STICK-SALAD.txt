well under cold running water, and drain again; set aside.

In a wok or wide frying pan, combine remaining 2 tb. vinegar, sugar,

over noodles and add radishes; mix lightly until well coated.

Mound noodle mixture on one side of a large platter or on individual
plates.  Arrange bean sprouts on other side. Garnish with mint leaves.

Place wok or frying pan over high heat.  When pan is hot, add oil;
then add steak slices, garlic, remaining 2 tb. fish sauce and
remaining 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper. Cook, stirring, until meat is
