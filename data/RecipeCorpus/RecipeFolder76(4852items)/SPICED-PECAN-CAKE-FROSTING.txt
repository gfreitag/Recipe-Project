Title: SPICED PECAN CAKE FROSTING
Categories: Cakes, Toppings
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
3/4 c  Water
8    Egg yolks
1 1/2 c  Margarine, softened
2 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
4 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
2 1/2 c  Pecans; coarsely chopped
Use margarine rather than butter in this frosting because butter
tends to melt out of the frosting as the cake sits awhile. Roast
pecans until dark, then cool. Combine the granulated sugar and water
in a 1 quart saucepan. Cook over medium heat to soft thread stage
(230 degrees on a candy thermometer), about 15 minutes. Do not Stir.
In a large bowl of an electric mixer, beat egg yolks on high speed
just slightly, about 5 seconds. Gradually, add the hot sugar water
mixture. Beat until thoroughly cool, thick, shiny and very pale,
about 10 minutes. Start at low speed so it won't splash; then go to
high speed. If crystal sugar builds up around the sides of the bowl,
don't scrape it into the mixture, it will make the frosting lumpy and
you will have plenty of frosting without it. Gradually, add the
margarine and mix on medium speed until completely blended and very
smooth, about 5 minutes. Blend in the powdered sugar and vanilla
extract on low speed until smooth, then, add the pecans. Beat on high
speed until thoroughly mixed and very thick. If frosting is too
thick, thin with a little cream, milk or water.
