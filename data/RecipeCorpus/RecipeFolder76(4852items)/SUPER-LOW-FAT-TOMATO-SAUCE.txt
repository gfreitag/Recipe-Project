Categories: Sauces, Low-fat
Yield: 2 Cups
14 1/2 oz Can, plum tomatoes,
Undrained
1    Small onion, peeled and
Diced (1/2 cup)
1    (1-2) garlic cloves, finely
Chopped
1 ts Dried basil leaves
1/4 ts (1/4-1/2) crushed red

In medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine all ingredients;
bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low; simmer 10-20 minutes, or until
liquid is reduced by half. In food processor or blender, puree small
quantities of sauce at a time to desired consistency, pulsing on and
off 3 to 4 times for a chunky sauce, longer for a smoother sauce.
