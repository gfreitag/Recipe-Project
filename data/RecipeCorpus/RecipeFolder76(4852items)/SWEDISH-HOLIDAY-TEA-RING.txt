Title: SWEDISH HOLIDAY TEA RING
Categories: Breads, Machine, Holidays, Swedish
Yield: 1 Loaf
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1 c  Warm milk
1    Egg, slightly beaten
3 c  Bread flour
1/3 c  Sugar
4 tb Butter, cut up
1 ts Salt
1 pk Active dry/rapid-rise yeast
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3 tb Soft butter (to 4 tb)
1/2 c  Chopped candied cherries
1/2 c  Golden or dark raisins
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts or pecans
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Ground cinnamon
Measure the dough ingredients into the container of the bread
machine in the order given. (Reverse the order in machines which call
for adding the liquids last of all).

Set the machine to the Dough cycle and press Start.

About 1 1/2 hours later, when the dough is ready, coat a work
surface lightly with nonstick cooking spray.

Turn the dough out onto the surface and pat and roll out to about
16 by 20 inches.  Spread with the butter and sprinkle with the
cherries, raisins and nuts.  Mix the sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle
over.

Roll the dough up to enclose the filling, starting from the 20-inch
side. Seal the roll.

Place on a lightly greased baking pan and pinch the ends together
to make a wreath shape. With a pair of scissors make cuts almost all
the way through the roll from the outside toward the center every 1/2
~inch. Pull the cuts outward and lay dough down with a cut side up.

Let rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes, until puffy. Preheat
the oven to 375 degrees. Bake the tea ring for 20 to 25 minutes until
golden. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack. Frost with a
powdered sugar and milk icing, if desired.  Serve warm. Makes about 8
servings.
