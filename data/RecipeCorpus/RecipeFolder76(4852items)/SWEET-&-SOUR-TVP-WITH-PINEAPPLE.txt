1 1/4 c  Hot water
MMMMM--------------------REST OF INGREDIENTS-------------------------
1 c  Sliced carrots
1    Green pepper cut in 1"square
20 oz Can unsweetened pineapple;
-chunks
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Cider vinegar
2 tb Cornstarch
1/4 c  Tamari
Combine first three ingredients and let stand 5 minutes. Cover
tightly and microwave on medium high power for 10 minutes or add 1/2
c liquid and simmer in a covered pan until tender but not mushy
(20-30 minutes). Bring 1 cup water to a boil and add carrot and
pepper. Cover, return to a boil and cook for 2 minutes to
crisp-tender. Remove from heat, drain, reserving liquid. Return
liquid to pan and add juice from the pineapples. Bring the liquid to
a boil and add sugar and cider-vinegar. In a small bowl, combine the
cornstarch and tamari. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the hot
liquid; the sauce will thicken and come to a boil almost at once. Add
the cooked TVP, the carrots & pepper, and pineapple to the sauce.
Serve over rice or crisp chow mein noodles. This can be made ahead of
time and reheated later. PER SERVING: Calories: 234, Protein: 6gm,
