Title: THE BELGIAN LION -- WHITE BEAN SOUP
Categories: S, O, U, P
Yield: 8 Servings  The white bean soup, (like my mother use to make) that we served at
the Husch winery dinner was well received and several people asked me
if I would give the recipe. Here it is. But keep in mind that this is
not an exact type of recipe. You should be guided by your own taste
and imagination.

For the beans: 1 pound Great Northern white beans 2 carrots 2
branches of celery 1 onion Fresh thyme A few bay leaves Sea salt

Place all ingredients in a pot and cover with plenty of water. Bring
to a gentle simmer and cook until beans are done. Leave beans a bit
underdone. Discard the vegetables and keep beans in cooking broth.

For the soup:  1 to 2 quarts of good chicken or beef broth. Chicken
or beef is a matter of taste and the amount you use will determine
how thick the soup will be. If you serve the soup as one course of a
several course dinner you probably want to keep the soup rather thin.
On the other hand, this soup can be served as a main course and then
could be served quite thick.

2 or 3 carrots, chopped 2 or 3 celery stalks, chopped 1 or 2 leeks,
chopped 1 red onion, chopped 4 or 5 garlic cloves, chopped A bunch of
fresh spinach or red chard. (This is optional.)

Place all the ingredients except spinach or chard in a heavy pan with
some good olive oil. Saut√© the vegetables without browning. Keep them
firm.

Strain the beans and add them to the other vegetables. Add the amount
of stock you want and bring to a gentle simmer. Add salt and black
pepper to taste. If you are using spinach (my preference) or chard,
coarsely chop the leaves, discarding the stems and add to the soup.

If you are serving the soup as a main course you may serve it
accompanied by a good country bread and grated Parmesan or Swiss
cheese.

For the wine? A Marsanne, Semillo Viognier or even a light red like a
Beaujolae or a young Cotes du Rhone.
