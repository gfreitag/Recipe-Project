Categories: Meatless
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lg Baking potatoes
6 oz Fresh spinach
1 c  All-purpose flour; divided
1/4 c  Part-skim ricotta cheese
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
1    Egg
Vegetable cooking spray
2 tb Butter
1 c  Seeded and diced peeled red
-tomato
1 c  Seeded and diced peeled
-yellow toma
1    Garlic; minced
1 tb Red wine vinegar
3/4 c  Grated Asiago cheese; (3

1 tb Chopped fresh chives
Wrap potatoes in foil; bake at 400 degrees for 1 hour. Let cool; peel
and mash.

Remove stems from spinach, and wash leaves. Place a large Dutch oven
over medium heat, and add spinach; cover and cook 2 minutes or until
spinach wilts (do not add water). Press spinach between paper towels;
chop.

Combine mashed potato, chopped spinach, 1/2 cup flour, and next 5
ingredients; stir to form a soft dough. Turn dough out onto a
well-floured surface; knead in remaining flour. Divide dough into 4
portions, shaping each into a 12-inch rope. Cut each rope into 12
(1-inch) pieces; roll each piece into a ball. Drag tines of a fork
through half of each ball, forming a concave gnocchi shape. Place on
a baking sheet coated with cooking spray; set aside.

Bring 14 cups of water to a boil in a Dutch oven. Add half of the
gnocchi, and cook 1-1/2 minutes. Remove gnocchi with a slotted spoon;
place in a colander. Repeat with remaining gnocchi.

Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until nutty-brown
color. Add tomatoes and garlic; saute 2 minutes. Remove from heat;
stir in vinegar.

Place gnocchi in a 2-quart baking dish coated with cooking spray.
Spoon tomato mixture over gnocchi; sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 350
degrees for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with chives. Yield: 6 servings
(serving size: 8 gnocchi).
