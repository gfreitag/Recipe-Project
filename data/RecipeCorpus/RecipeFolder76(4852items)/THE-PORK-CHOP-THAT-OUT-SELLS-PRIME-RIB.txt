6    Iowa pork chops
MARINATING SAUCE:
2 c  Soy sauce
1 tb Dark molasses
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 ts Salt
RED SAUCE:
1/3 c  Water
1    14oz bottle Heinz ketchup
1    12oz bottle Heinz chili
-sauce
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 tb Dry mustard
Mix soy sauce, water, brown sugar, molasses and salt and bring to a
boil. Let cool. Put pork chops in a pan with the bone side up. Pour
marinating sauce over chops. Let stand in refrigerator overnight.
Next day, take chops out of sauce, place in a baking pan and cover
with foil TIGHTLY. Bake until tendeer in a 375 degree oven(about 2
hours). While chops are baking combine all red sauce ingredients in a
heavy saucepan or broiler. Mix dry ingredients and water together,
leaving no lumps. Bring all ingredients to a slight boil. Red sauce
is done. Afer the chops are tender, remove them from oven and dip in
red sauce. Bake singly for 30 minutes at 350 degrees or until
slightly glazed. Serve now or keep chops at room temperature until
you are ready to put on charcoul grill, with grill as high as
possible for 15 minutes.  Alittle blacking does not hurt-BUT WATCH
CAREFULLY. Serve individually on serving plate or platter. Do not
stack (glaze is pretty)
