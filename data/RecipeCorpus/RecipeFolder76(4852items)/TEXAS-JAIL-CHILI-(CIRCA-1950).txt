Texas prison chili got its good reputation from Sheriff Smoot Schmid's
truly fine recipe for the Dallas County Jail. Recently, however, a
Texas prison chili contest was won by Huntsville Penitentiary with a
godawful recipe that called for twice as much cumin as chili powder
and "2 handfuls" of monosodium glutamate. In Texas, this is called
crime deterrence.

Dallas County Chili

Fry suet in a heavy kettle. Add meat, finely diced garlic and
seasonings; cover. Cook slowly for four hours, stirring occasionally.
Add the water and continue cooking until the chili has thickened
slightly, about one hour. Serve plain or mixed with equal portion of
cooked pink or red beans.
