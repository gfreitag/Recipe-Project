Title: SWEDISH FLATBREAD (BAKESTONE RECIPES)
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 8 Servings
8 oz Ground wholemeal flour
8 oz Rye or barley flour
1 ts Salt
8 fl Lukewarm water*
*You may need as much as 12 fl total.  -- Blend the flours together
with the salt.  Mix in sufficient water to bind together into a dough
~- the quantity will depend on the types of flour used. -- Beat until
dough leaves the sides of the bowl, then turn onto a floured board
and knead thoroughly. Heat the bakestone over a moderate heat and
grease it. Divide the dough into four and roll one quarter out into a
round as thin as possible. Using a plate about 8 inches wide, trim
the edges into a neat circle. Prick all over to prevent the dough
bubbling while cooking. ~- Transfer to the bakestone and cook over a
moderate heat for about 15 minutes, or until slightly colored. Then
turn and cook the other side. Repeat with the rest of the dough,
working up the trimmings for re-shaping and baking. -- Cool on a wire
tray.  When cold, store in an airtight container.
(Danish-butter-cookie containers, the big ones, are good for this.)
