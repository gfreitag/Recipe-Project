Categories: Vegetarian, Italian, Pies
Yield: 8 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1 tb Yeast
1 c  Warm water
1/2 ts Sugar
1 tb Oil
3 c  Unbleached flour
1/2 ts Salt
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 c  TVP granules or flakes
7/8 c  Boiling water
1 ts Oregano
1 ts Basil
1/2 ts Fennel seeds
1 tb Olive oil
2 c  Mushrooms, sliced
10 oz Frozen chopped spinach,
-thawed and drained
6 oz Tomato paste
1/4 c  Water
Soymilk or oil for brushing
-top crust
Dough:  In a large bowl, mix together yeast, water, and sugar. Let
stand 5 minutes.  Add oil, flour, and salt. Knead about 5 minutes
into a smooth, elastic ball of dough, Cover and let rise until double
in size. Punch down. Filling:  Mix together TVP, boiling water,
oregano, basil, and fennel seeds. In a large skillet, heat olive oil.
Saute TVP mixture for a few minutes. Stir in mushrooms, spinach,
tomato paste, and water until heated through. Preheat oven to 375
degrees. Roll the dough into a large oblong shape, spread filling
evenly on top and roll up like a jelly roll. Brush top with a little
bit of milk or oil. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. If crust begins to
brown too much, cover with foil during the last 5 or 10 minutes. Cut
into 16 slices to serve. Note: I have used half the oil in the bread
and 1/3 the oil in the filling with good results. Also, salt is
really needed in the filling (if you like salt).
