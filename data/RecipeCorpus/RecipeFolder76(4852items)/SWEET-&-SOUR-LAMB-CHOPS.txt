Categories: Main dish, Meats, Appetizers, Microwave
Yield: 3 Servings
2 tb Butter or margarine
2 lb Shoulder lamb chops
Salt and pepper
8 oz Pineapple chunks in unsweet-
Ened juice, undrained
1/4 c  Firm packed dark brown sugar
1/4 c  White vinegar
1 tb Cornstarch
1/2 ts Brown bouquet sauce
2    Carrots, peeled and
-thinly sliced
1 lg Green pepper, cut into
-1-inch squares
I. Melt butter in a heat-resistant, non-metallic broiler-proof
skillet on a conventional surface unit. When butter is hot, sear lamb
chops on both sides until lightly browned. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper to taste. Or use the "browner" for 4 to 5 minutes per side. 2.
While the chops are browning, drain pineapple juice into a small
heat-resistant, non-metallic bowl. Reserve pineapple chunks; add
brown sugar, vinegar, cornstarch and brown bouquet sauce to pineapple
juice. Stir to combine. 3. Heat pineapple juice mixture, uncovered, 2
minutes in Micro- wave Oven or until thickened and clear. 4. Pour
thickened sauce over browned lamb chops. 5. Add carrot slices and
heat, covered, 5 minutes in Microwave Oven. Add pineapple chunks and
heat, covered, 2 1/2 minutes in Microwave Oven. Add green pepper
squares and heat, un- covered, in Microwave Oven 2 1/2 minutes, or
until lamb and vegetables are tender. Variations: Pork chops, veal
chops, boneless chicken pieces or shrimp may be substituted for the
lamb chops; however, cooking times will have to be adjusted for pork,
chicken, and shrimp. Pork chops will require an extra 2 minutes in
Step 5, as pork should always be cooked to well-done. Chicken should
be cooked for only 4 minutes in Step 5 and shrimp 3 minutes.
