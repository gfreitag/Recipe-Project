Title: SWEDISH TEA RING
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
2    Cakes compressed yeast
1 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
1    Egg, well beaten
1 3/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Melted shortening
6 tb Sugar
5    To 5 1/4 cups flour
1/2 c  Chopped nuts
Soften yeast in water.  Add sugar, salt, shortening, and egg. Add
flour slowly, beating thoroughly after each addition until dough is
just stiff enough to knead. Turn onto lightly floured board and knead
until smooth and elastic.  (This dough should be slightly softer than
a bread dough.) Place in a bowl, cover with a warm, damp cloth, set
in a warm place and allow to double in bulk. Work down lightly. Cover
and allow to double in bulk the second time. Turn onto lightly
floured board and roll in sheet 1 1/2 inches thick.  Spread with
melted butter or butter substitute and sprinkle generously with sugar
and cinnamon, and roll as a jelly roll. Pinch the edges together and
join ends to form a ring. Place in an oiled pan or on an oiled baking
sheet.  Cut the dough with the scissors in 3-inch pieces, cutting 3/4
through the ring. Turn each section so that it lies flat on the
baking sheet. Sprinkle with sugar and chopped nuts. Cover with a
warm, damp cloth and let rise until treble in bulk. Bake in hot oven
(425 F) about 30 minutes.  If desired 1/2 cup raisins may be added to
the dough. The Household Searchlight - 1941
