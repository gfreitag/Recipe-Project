Categories: Dips, Spreads, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 Servings
1 lg Garlic clove; crushed
1    Lemon; juiced

This unusual dip has a strong, distinctive flavour reminiscent of
Middle Eastern cookery - its source. It is delicious with pitta
bread, and with florets of raw cauliflower to dip into it.

Blend the crushed garlic, lemon juice and tahini in the liquidizer
until; they make a smooth purÂ‚e. Season with the cumin and add salt
to taste. Stir in the parsley and mix well. Thin out to a dipping
consistency with more sesame oil.

Put into a serving-dish and sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds.
Put the slices of hard-boiled egg around the edge as a garnish.
