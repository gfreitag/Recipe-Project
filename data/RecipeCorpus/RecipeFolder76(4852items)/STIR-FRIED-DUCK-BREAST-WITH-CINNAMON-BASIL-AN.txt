"This colorful stir-fry draws from both Chinese and Southeast Asian
ingredients and is ideal for a light lunch if served with steamed
basamati rice or cooked noodles."

Skin and bone the duck breasts; slice into 1/2-inch strips. Peel and
sliver the gingerroot. Coarsely chop the basil.

Heat the peanut oil in a large, nonstick saute pan or wok over high
heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking add the duck and red pepper
and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and
ginger and cook 1 minute. Add the sherry, soy sauce, and chopped
basil and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from the
heat and serve immediately, garnished with the sprigs of basil.
