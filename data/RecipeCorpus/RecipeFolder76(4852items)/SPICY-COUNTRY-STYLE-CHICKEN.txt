Title: SPICY COUNTRY-STYLE CHICKEN
Categories: Oriental
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Boneless chicken breasts
- skinned
2 sm Fresh green or red chiles
8 oz Canned bamboo shoots
1/2 lb Zucchini
1 lg Red or green bell pepper
2 tb Oil, preferably peanut
2 tb Chicken stock
2 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
1 1/2 ts Chili bean sauce (or more)
2 ts Granulated sugar
2 tb Dark soy sauce
1 tb Chinese black rice vinegar
-=OR=- Cider vinegar
1 tb Tomato paste
CUT THE CHICKEN BREASTS into shreds about 3 inches long. Cut the fresh
chiles in half, carefully remove the seeds and shred the chiles. (Do
not touch your eyes while doing this, as it will make them sting.)
Then prepare all the vegetables. Rinse the bamboo shoots in clean
water and shred them. Trim the zucchini and shred them. Wash the bell
pepper, remove the seeds and shred it, too. Heat 1 tablespoon of the
oil in a wok or large skillet. When it is almost smoking, quickly
stir-fry the chicken shreds for 1 minute or until the chicken is
slightly firm. Remove the cooked chicken and drain it. Wipe the wok
clean. Reheat it and add the rest of the oil. When it is hot, add the
shredded chiles, bamboo shoots, zucchini and bell pepper. Stir-fry
for about 2 minutes, and then add the rest of the ingredients. Mix
them well and stir-fry for another minute. Return the chicken shreds
and give the mixture a few quick stirs to finish cooking the chicken.
Turn onto a serving platter and serve at once.
