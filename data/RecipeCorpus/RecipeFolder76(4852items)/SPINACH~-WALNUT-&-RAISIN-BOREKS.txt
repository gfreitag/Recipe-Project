Title: SPINACH~ WALNUT & RAISIN BOREKS
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Margarine
2 md Onion, chopped
2 pk (10-oz each) frozen chopped
Spinach thawed and squeezed
Dry
1    Lightly beaten egg
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts/almonds/
Pecan
1/3 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Chopped parsley
3/4 ts Salt
Fresh ground black pepper
1 ts Dried dill
1 lb Phyllo leaves
1 1/2    Stick margarine melted
Poppy seeds
In a large saucepan, cook the onions in 2 Tb margarine until soft, not
brown. Add the well squeezed spinach, egg, nuts, raisins, parsley,
salt, pepper and dill. Mix well. Taste for adequate seasoning. Thaw
the phyllo in the refrigerator for at least a day before using.
Unwrap and unrool dough, covering it with a damp, well-wrung towel to
keep it from drying out as you work. With scissors, cut the dough in
half lengthwise, all at once, rather than sheet by sheet, and stack
all together. Work off this stack. Brush some melted margarine along
half the top strip of dough. FOld the ungreased half over the greased
half and place a spoon of filling in one corner. Fold the strip over,
making a triangle. Continue making triangles as you fold the strip
up, like folding a flag. Tuck under any ragged edges and brush top of
triangle with margarine. Sprinkle with poppy seeds. Place on a baking
tray so as to get as many as possible on one sheet. Continue filling
strips of dough until all filling is used. Bake the boreks, one tray
at a time, in the upper third of a preheated 375 degree oven about
20-25 minutes or until golden, turning pan once after about 15
minutes. Cool the boreks on a wire rack for a few minutes before
serving so condensation doesn't form and soften the crust. Serve
warm. Assembled boreks can be refrigerated for a day or two before
baking, or after baking freeze them on a cookie sheet and then box
them. Rewarm boreks in a 375 degree oven about 10 minutes.
