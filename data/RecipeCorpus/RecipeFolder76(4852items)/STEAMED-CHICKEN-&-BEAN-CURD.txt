This dish looks good, tastes good and is simple to prepare. It is one
of a family of pudding-like dishes.

Preparation:  All mixing can be done in food processor. Or, use
cleaver to finely mince chicken and mash bean curd. In bowl, combine
egg whites, oil, ginger juice, gin, salt, five-spice powder and
sugar; stir to breakdown egg and blend.  Add chicken and bean curd;
mix thoroughly. Dip cabbage leaves in boiling water to make limp.
Wash and peel carrot; slice thinly on bias.

Steaming:  Place limp leaves in shallow bowl.  Arrange carrots on
leaves in decorative pattern.  Pack chicken/bean curd mixture tightly
in bowl to fill it. Steam for about 40 minutes at medium boil.
Steaming will make mixture very smooth and firm (avoid over-steaming,
which causes bean curd to become dry and hard). When ready to serve,
turn out on serving platter; gently remove leaves; cover with glaze.

Glaze:  Heat stock in saucepan; when hot, add cornstarch paste to
thicken. When ready to use, reheat and add sesame oil; pour over dish.
