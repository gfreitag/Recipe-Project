Yield: 6 Servings
6    Boneless skinless chicken
-breasts ( 1-1/2 lb)
1 ts Butter
1/2 c  Dry sherry
STUFFING:
12    Large spinach leaves
1 tb Butter
1    Onion, chopped
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1 c  Coarsely grated zucchini
1/2 c  Coarsely grated carrot

Between sheets of waxed paper, pound chicken to 1/4 inch thickness.

STUFFING:  Trim spinach and rinse under water, shake off excess
water. In saucepan, cover spinach and cook over medium-high heat,
with just the water clinging to leaves, for 1 minute or until just
wilted; drain and set aside.

In nonstick skillet, melt 1 tbsp. butter over medium heat; cook onion
and garlic for 3 minutes or until softened. Stir in zucchini, carrot
and thyme; cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes or until tender.
Remove from heat. Add bread crumbs, parsley, egg white, salt and
pepper; mix well.

Top each chicken breast with 2 spinach leaves; spread stuffing evenly
over spinach. Carefully roll up each breast and tie each end with
cotton string. (Chicken can be prepared to this point, covered and
refrigerated for up to 8 hours.)

In large nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat; cook stuffed
breasts, turning occasionally, for 5 minutes. Pour in sherry; reduce
heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes or until
chicken is no longer pink inside, turning to coat in sauce for last 2
minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes. Untie each roll and cut diagonally
into 3 or 4 slices. Makes 6 servings.  Typed in MMFormat by
