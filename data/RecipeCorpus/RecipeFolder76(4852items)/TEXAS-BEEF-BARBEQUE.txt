Title: TEXAS BEEF BARBEQUE
Categories: Main
Yield: 1 Servings
6 lb Beef brisket
2 qt Bone stock
3    Bay leaves
Salt and pepper
Put the bay leaves in a about a cup of water and bring to a boil. Let
it simmer 10 minutes or so, then remove the leaves and add the bay
tea to the bone stock, along with the salt and pepper. Put the
brisket in your Dutch Oven and add the stock mixture to cover it
about a quarter of the way. Cover and cook over the fire, turning the
brisket about every half hour until it's nearly done.  This can be
determined by forking. Mop it and lay it on the grill to finish
cooking, being sure to turn it and mop it every 20 minutes or so. To
make a good natural gravy, add a little Worcestershire Sauce and
maybe a dash of chili powder to the liquid you cooked the brisket in.
You can also serve this with barbecue sauce.
