6 c  Fresh strawberries
3/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Minute tapioca
1 1/3 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Solid vegetable shortening
2 tb (To 3 T) water

Mix strawberries with sugar and tapioca.  Let stand while making
pastry. Combine flour and salt in bowl. Cut in shortening until
uniform, but coarse.  Reserve about 1/2 cupful of mixture; set aside.
Sprinkle water over remaining mixture in bowl; toss with fork and
press into ball. Roll on lightly-floured board to fit pie plate. Fill
with strawberry mixture. Cut an 8 inch round piece of foil; lay over
filling. Bake in preheated 400 oven for 35 minutes.  Blend reserved
1/2 cupful of flour mixture, brown sugar and cinnamon. Remove foil;
sprinkle mixture over pie. Continue baking for 30-40 minutes or until
crust and crumb topping are browned. Cool.

Note:  If pie bubbles over during baking, place a sheet of foil
beneath it.
