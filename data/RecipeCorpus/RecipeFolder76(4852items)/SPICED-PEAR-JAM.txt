Title: SPICED PEAR JAM
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Chopped cored & peeled pears
1    Package Ball fruit pectin
5 c  Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground clove
1/2 ts Ginger
1/4 ts Allspice
In large kettle dump pears and pectin, mix well. Cook over medium heat
until mixture starts to boil, stirring constantly. Add sugar and
spices (I mixed them together ahead of time). Bring mixture to a boil
once again, stirring constantly. Boil one minute and remove from
heat. Ladle mixture into hot jam jars, cap and processing in boiling
water bath for 10 minutes. Jars will create a seal when they start to
cool. Enjoy!
