Title: TARRAGON LAMB
Categories: Lamb, Main dish, Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
4 lb Leg of lamb
2/3 c  Cream
1 ts Tarragon
1 1/4 c  Dry white wine
1 tb Oil
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Onion sliced
Skin  the  leg of lamb and trim away all the outside fat and as much
of the fat lying between the muscle tissue that you can reach. Score
the flesh deeply with a criss-cross pattern and stuff the slits with
the tarragon. Rub the meat with the oil and cover with the onion.
Place in a suitable dish for marinating and pour over the white wine.
Add a little salt and pepper and leave to marinate for about 2 hours
in a cool place, basting occasionally.  Roast the lamb with the
marinade, basting it frequently, in a warm oven 325 deg F until done.
About 10 minutes before the meat is cooked,  pour off the marinade
and meat juices into a saucepan. Reduce the gravy to half its
original quantity  by  boiling vigorously. Carve the meat into thin
slices and add the resulting juices to the marinade. Arrange the meat
on a serving dish  and  keep warm.   Remove the gravy from the heat,
stir in cream and carefully re- heat the sauce until it forms a
medium-thick consistency. Pour the sauce over the lamb and keep warm.
