Categories: Indian, Sauces
Yield: 2 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
1/2 c  Raw unblanched almonds
1/2 c  Shelled, unsalted raw
-pistachio nuts
2 tb Butter or mild vegetable oil
1 lg Onion, peeled and grated
1/2 ts Ground coriander
1/4 ts Mace
1/2 ts Freshly ground white pepper
2    Green cardamom pods, husked,
-ground
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
1 pn Nutmeg
1/2 ts Saffron threads *
2 c  Heavy cream
3/4 ts Salt, or to taste
* soaked in 2 tablespoons hot water

Serve this smooth sauce on grilled meat or chicken breasts. One
recipe will be enough for about 1 1/2 pounds of cooked meat. For an
exotic twist on an old standby, simmer 1 1/2 Pounds of your favorite
meatballs in it for 15 minutes.

Combine almonds and pistachios in a 10-inch frying pan and dry-roast
over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes. Place in a blender or a food
processor and reduce to a powder. Set aside.

Heat butter in a heavy 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add
onion and cook until lightly browned. Stir in spices and cook until
fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in saffron, cream, salt and powdered
nuts. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer,
stirring occasionally, until sauce is thick enough to coat the back
of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Makes 2 1/2 cups.
