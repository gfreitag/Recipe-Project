4 tb Salt
1 qt Water

Make a brine from the salt and water. Soak the chiles for an hour in
the brine. Heat a good quantity of oil. When it's very hot, deep fry
the chiles until they are crisp. Drain, salt and serve.

This is the simplest way to fix dried chiles. I am told it is eaten
as a snack at movie theaters in Sri Lanka. Since I've never been
there, I don't know if it's true. -- David Cook WALT
