Title: STRAWBERRY CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 cn (about 12oz) tomato sauce
1 c  Strawberry jam
2 tb Red wine vinegar
1 tb Chili powder
1/2 ts Dry thyme
1/2 ts Ground ginger
4    Skinless chicken breasts OR
12    Skinless chicken thighs)
1/2 c  Thinly sliced green onions
In a shallow 3 quart casserole dish, mix tomato sauce, jam, vinegar,
chili powder, thyme and ginger.

Rinse chicken and pat dry, then add to sauce and turn to coat.

Bake in a 400 degree oven, basting occasionally until no longer pink.
Remove and garnish with onions.

Serve over brown rice with green beans (that's what I did anyway) or
whatever side dishes you like best.

If you're using a larger casserole dish, you might want to use a bit
more tomato sauce...and be sure to spray the pan with Pam.
