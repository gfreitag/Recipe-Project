Microwave Cookery, by Carol Medina Maze Tamales de Chili Colorado
Dough In food processor, combine the Chili Colorado, the corn, and
the hominy; process until pureed. (You may need to do this in batches
unless you have a large food processor.)

In a large bowl, combine the pureed chili mixture, the shortening, the
salt, the baking powder, and the cornmeal. Mix dough until smooth.
(The recipe says to use an electric mixer, but I found it easier to
just use a spoon.)
