Title: STRAWBERRY-RHUBARB COMPOTE
Categories: Digest, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Chopped rhubarb (green or
Pink, it doesnt matter)
1 c  Chopped strawberries
1/4 c  (or so) sugar
1/2 c  (or so) water
In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine rhubarb, sugar and water. Bring
to simmer, then turn heat very low. Cook without stirring for several
hours. When the rhubarb is very soft, add the strawberries and cook
for another hour or so. Stir gently. Add more sugar if needed.

The ratio of rhubarb to berries is flexible.  Im sure you can prepare
this recipe faster, but Im told rhubarb likes to stew slowly
(macerate?). I start a batch on Saturday, when Im generally in and
out of the kitchen anyway. I like the compote warm or cold. If youre
feeling decadent, its good over ff ice cream or baked goods.
