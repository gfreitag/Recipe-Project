Shape the meat into 12 thin patties, pressing them just enough to
make the meat cling together.  Cut the cheese into slivers and
arrange on half the patties, leaving space to seal the edges. Place
the remaining patties over the cheese and press the edges firmly to
seal. Grill 4 to 5-inches above hot coals until browned on both
sides, turning as needed to cook evenly. Cook until done as desired,
about 10 minutes total cooking time for rare., 12 to 15 minutes for
medium, and 15 to 18 minutes for well done. Serve hot on toasted buns
with catsup, mustard, pickle relish, or other condiments.
