FOR THE GENOISE: Preheat oven to 350~F. Break the eggs into the bowl
of an electric mixer and whisk in salt, then sugar. Place the bowl
over a pan of simmering water and whisk until just lukewarm. Whip by
machine until cold and increased in volume, about 4-to-5 minutes. Mix
cake flour and cornstarch. Sift over egg foam in 3 or 4 additions,
folding it in with a rubber spatula. Pour the batter into a buttered,
paper-lined 10-inch round pan and level it off. Bake the Genoise
layer about 30 minutes until it is well risen, golden and beginning
to shrink away from sides. Unmold immediately and cool on a rack.
Bake and cool the Genoise layer.
