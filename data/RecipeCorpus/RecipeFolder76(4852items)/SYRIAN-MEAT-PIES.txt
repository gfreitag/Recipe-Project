Title: SYRIAN MEAT PIES
Categories: Mediteranea
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Ground meat
1/2 c  Pomegranate juice
1/4 c  Lemon juice
2 tb Mom's Allspice -- see
Recipie
Salt and pepper -- to taste
Pillsbury Buttermilk
Bisquits
Mix all ingredients (except for the bisquits) and let marinate
overnite in the fridge. As mom described it..."we'll see what it says
in the morning"!

Open the bisquit package, and let them get to room temp. Coat a cookie
sheet with oil, and press those biscuits into 6 inch pies, using more
oil to lubricate them with your fingers. Fill the pies with the meat
mixture, and turn over the ends slightly. Bake at 350 degrees for
about 15 minutes, or until browned. These are great to make ahead of
time...they freeze well, and can be nuked for a lunchtime snack.
