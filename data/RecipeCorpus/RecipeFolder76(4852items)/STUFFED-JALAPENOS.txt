Title: STUFFED JALAPENOS
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 6 Servings
10 lg Pickled jalapenos
10    Pieces Cheddar cheese
2    Egg whites, beaten
3 tb Cornmeal
3 tb Flour
oil for deep-frying

Slit the sides of the peppers, and scrape out the seeds. Stuff with
triangular pieces of cheddar cheese cut to fit the individual peppers.

Dip peppers in an egg wash then into a mixture of half cornmeal and
half flour.  Repeat, and allow to dry for about 15 minutes.

Deep fry in hot fat until the peppers are lightly browned, and the
cheese is just melting.  Drain on absorbent paper, and serve.

You can also use a crabmeat or shrimp salad stuffing for these.
