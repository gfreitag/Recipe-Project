Title: SUNFLOWER PEANUT BUTTER
Categories: Spreads
Yield: 1 Cup
1 c  Sunflower seeds; *
3/4 c  Peanuts; *
;salt to taste
Vegetable oil; as needed
* OR 1 1/4 cups sunflower seed meal OR 1/2 cup sunflower seed butter,
raw or roasted

** OR 1 cup peanut meal OR 1/2 cup peanut butter, raw or roasted

This recipe could be very complicated for a simple nut butter. What is
important is the proportion of sunflower seeds to peanuts. If you
substitute butter for nuts, or meal for sunflower seeds, just be sure
the proportions are correct. You may also use either raw or roasted
nuts, seeds, meals, or butters in any combination.

1. For whole seeds and nuts, grind them together in your blender,
adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup oil to start them into butter. Add salt to
taste.

2. For meals: stir the meals (and salt) together. Add oil to turn
them into butter.

3. For butters: simply combine the two butters, adding salt if
desired.

Combinations: A delicious and crunchy butter could be made by
reserving about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of whole sunflower seeds. Add these
whole seeds (raw or roasted) to the finished butter.
