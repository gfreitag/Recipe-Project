Rinse chickpeas, place in a large bowl and cover with 9 cups water.
Refrigerate and let soak overnight. In a large pot, bring two quarts
of water to a boil. Add sage and bay leaves. Drain chickpeas and
rinse well. Add chickpeas to boiling water and cook until they are
soft, about 30 to 45 minutes.  Drain chickpeas, reserving 2 cups of
cooking liquid. Sprinkle chickpeas with salt and pepper, and lightly
mash them with a fork. Set aside to cool. In a large bowl toss
tomatoes with garlic and parsley. Add cooled chickpeas and toss with
just enough reserved cooking liquid to moisten.  Add vinegar to
taste. Bring a small saucepan of salted water to a boil.  Fill a
large bowl with ice water and set aside. Place escarole leaves in a
strainer and submerge in boiling water until leaves are soft, about 2
minutes. Remove leaves from water and immediately plunge them into
ice water. Drain and pat dry. Lay leaves out flat nad place about 2
or 3 tablespoons of chickpea mixture at broad end of each leaf. Roll
up like a cigar, turning sides in to enclose filling. Serve at room
temperature.
