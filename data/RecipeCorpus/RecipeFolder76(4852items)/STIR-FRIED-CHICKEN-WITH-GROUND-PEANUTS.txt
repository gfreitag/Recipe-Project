Water
Cut the chicken breast into triple-matchstick-sized slivers, rub
these with salt and cornflour, and fold into beaten egg-white. Roast
or fry the peanuts over a low heat until slightly brown and crush or
grind coarsely. Cut the spring onions into short segments, and the
pepper into shreds (discarding the pips). Mix the liquid ingredients
for the sauce thoroughly. Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the
chicken slivers and turn them in the hot oil for 1 minutes. Drain
away any excess oil. Heat the lard in a separate pan. Add the chopped
peppers and spring onions to fry for 1 1/2 minutes.  Pour in the
liquid ingredients for the sauce. Stir quickly to mix.  When the
liquid thickens return the chicken to the pan. Turn and stir the
chicken in the sauce. Sprinkle the peanuts over the chicken. Turn it
over quickly a few times, and serve immediately in a well-heated
serving dish.  The roasted peanuts add an aromatic flavor to this
chicken dish.
