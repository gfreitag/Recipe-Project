Categories: Poultry, Main dish, Oriental
Yield: 1 Serving
1 md To lg whole chicken,
-cut into pieces
-(option: skin removed)
3    Chayote squash, peeled,
-deseeded and sliced
8 cl To 12 cloves of garlic,
-crushed with a knife flat
-and chopped fine
5    6 jalapenos, serranos or
-habaneros, whole
1 pk Fresh spinach
-(or approximately 10 oz.)
10 c  12 c. water
1 md Onion; sliced
1/4 c  1/3 c FRESH ginger;
-peeled and julienned
2 tb Canola oil
4 tb Patis (fish sauce)*
-approximately
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
In a LARGE pot lightly saute the garlic in the oil until lightly
brown. Add ginger and onions, cook till onions turn translucent. Add
chicken pieces, mix well. Add patis and black pepper to mixture. Add
at LEAST 10 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce
heat, cook until the chicken is tender, about 45 minutes. When
chicken is done, add the chayote squash and the chiles, then return
to a boil and cook over a medium heat for about 10-15 minutes until
the squash is tender. Then, add the spinach on top of the soup, cover
and cook until spinach wilts, about 1-2 minutes. Serve with brown
rice, and the traditional Filipino way is to take one of the cooked
chiles out and put it in a small bowl with enough patis to cover,
then smash the chile up in the sauce. You then use the chile/patis
mixture to season, if it's not salty enough. * This is easiest found
in an oriental grocery. The best brand is Rufina,  if you can't get
that, Tiparos (from Thailand) is OK. Submitted By RICHARD EIKENBURG
