Title: STRUDEL PASTRY BASIC RECIPE
Categories: Molto
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Stick butter plus 3 sticks
(cold)
1 ts Salt
2 1/2 c  Flour plus 1 cup
1/2 c  Ice water
In a food processor, place 1 stick of butter, 1 teaspoon salt, and 2
1/2 cups flour and blend until texture of breadcrumbs.  Slowly add
ice water until dough comes together.  Remove and form into a ball,
then flatten it into a 8 by 10-inch rectangle and place in
refrigerator. This is called the pasta mixture.

In a food processor, place 3 remaining sticks of butter and 1 cup four
until blended and scrape out on to a board.  Working quickly, form
this mixture in a 4-inch square and place in refrigerator. This is
called the burro mixture.

After 1/2 hour, when the two mixtures are similar in texture, place
pasta mixture on a well-floured clean marble surface.  Place burro
mixture in center and fold the pasta mixture over it, like wrapping a
gift. Flatten with a rolling pin and roll out to a 8 by 16-inch
rectangle, flouring regularly.  If butter comes to surface, flour the
spot heavily and continue working.  Fold bottom third up and top
third down to form a small package and turn one quarter clockwise.
Pat dough with rolling pin to adhere and roll out to large 8-inch by
16-inch rectangle again. Repeat folding process and refrigerate 30
minutes, covered in a moist cloth. Remove and repeat the
rolling-and-folding process 3 times.  Allow 30 minutes refrigeration
between each maneuver.  The dough is now ready and will keep in the
refrigerator 10 days, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap.
