to 2 tablespoons butter to grease mold. Place a double thickness of

foil, leaving only about 1 inch overhang. If mold has a lid, place on
top. Place rack in steamer and add boiling water just to bottom of

lid. Reduce heat to low and cook at a low boil for 2 hours, adding
boiling water occasionally to keep water level just below rack.

covers and unmold Dust generously with confectioners' sugar. Serve
plain, with whipped cream, a chocolate sauce, or Brandy butter.
