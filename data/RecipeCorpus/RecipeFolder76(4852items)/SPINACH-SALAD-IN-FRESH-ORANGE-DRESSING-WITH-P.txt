Title: SPINACH SALAD IN FRESH ORANGE DRESSING WITH P
Categories: Rosie's
Yield: 4 Servings
6    Navel Oranges, Chilled
4 c  Trimmed spinach 1 lg bunch
1 1/2 c  Trimmed watercress 1 bunch
1 tb Pine nuts
1/3 c  Minced shallots 2-3 large
2    Garlic cloves, peel & minced
5 tb White balsamic vinegar
2 ts Sherry vinegar
Freshly ground pepper
Peel the oranges and remove the white pith.  Over a bowl positioned to
catch the juice, separate the segments of each orange from the
membrane with a sharp knife, discarding the seeds, and set them
aside. Squeeze the residual juice from the membranes into the bowl
and reserve. Combine the spinach and watercress in a mixing bowl. Put
the pine nuts in a small saute' pan and cook over medium heat for
about 6 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until the nuts are
golden brown. Transfer the pine nuts to a small bowl. Put the
shallots, garlic, vinegars and reserved orange juice into the saute'
pan.  Bring to a bowl over low heat. Stir in the black pepper (to
taste), then pour the dressing over the spinach and watercress. Toss
to coat. Arrange mixture on salad plates, spoon orange segments atop
each and garnish with the pine nuts and, if you like, orange wheels.
MAKING ORANGE WHEELS Slice an unpeeled orange into 1/4-inch rounds.
Make a cute halfway across each round, from the peel to the core, and
twist the sides of the cut in opposite directions so that the top
half of the round will stand upright when placed on the salad.
