Recipe by: The Thrill of the Grill by Chris Schlesinger 1. Rub the
brisket thoroughly on all its sides with the barbecue rub, and allow
it to come to room temperature.

2. In the pit of a covered grill, build a very small fire on one side
as far up against one wall as possible. Place the brisket on the
grill on the side opposite from the fire so that none of the brisket
is directly over the flame. Put the top on the cooker, pull up a
chair, and grab the cooler.

This is where a person learns about the Zen of Barbecue. You gotta
keep the fire going, but very quietly. If you've got a thermometer on
your covered grill, you want to keep the temperature between 180 and
220 F. Remer, "Slow and low is the way to go." You have to figure out
your own personal refueling policy. The one I like is one handful of
coals or wood chunks to every beer.

This goes on for about 8 to 10 hours or however long you can make it,
the longer the better. Don't be scared by the darkening of the
exterior, the outside of the brisket will be superdark--my personal
favorite part.

3. Upon completion, pull the brisket out, trim off any excess fat, and
slice it thin. Serve with barbecue sauce on the side--no pro would
ever cover properly cooked brisket with sauce, he'd just dab on a
touch.

Obviously the key here is a tremendous amount of patience and a day
when you want to do nothing but sit around. But the end product is
one of those great culinary events that results from spending a lot
of time doing something that is relaxing and enjoyable. Make sure you
have plenty of tall boys for eating this.
