In New Orleans, Red Beans and Rice has evolved into a traditional
Monday dish, but it's a fine accompaniment anytime for fried chicken,
pork chops, ham, or sausage.  In a large saucepan combine the dried
beans and the water, cover, and soak overnight.  Add the pork, bacon,
or ham and bring to a simmer.  Cook, covered, for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium skillet heat the oil and saute the onion and
garlic for 3 minutes or until golden.  Add the mixture to the beans
along with the parsley, salt, and Tabasco sauce.  Cover and simmer
1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hours longer, or until the beans are tender enough to
mash one easily with a fork.  Add hot water as needed to keep the
beans covered, and stir occasionally.  When the beans are finished
they will have soaked up most of the liquid.  Serve over the hot
cooked rice.
