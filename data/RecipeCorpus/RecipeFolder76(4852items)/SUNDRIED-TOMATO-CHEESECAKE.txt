Ann's notes:  This is a delicious, though unusual color (burnt orange)
appetizer.  I used the not-oil-packed tomatoes and soaked them in hot
water first.  I then added 1 T. olive oil instead of the 1 T. reserved
tomato-oil.  I also cut these into 28 pieces and they were just right
for pick-up appetizers. I found the baking time specified to be too
short. Next time, I would increase the temperature to 375 for the
filled cake to get it done in 20-25 minutes.
