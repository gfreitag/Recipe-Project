2    Pork tenderloins (3/4 to 1

3/4 c  Coconut milk (1/2 of a 14oz

1/4 c  Soy sauce

Rinse meat and pat dry.  Trim fat and silvery membrane from

evenly thick; tie to secure.  Put meat in a zip-lock bag (about 2
quart size). In small bowl, mix coconut milk, 3 Tbs soy sauce,
garlic, 1 tsp coriander, white pepper, and chile paste; pour over
meat. Seal bag and rotate to coat meat with sauce; chill 3 to 6
hours. Turn meat over several times.
Life meat form marinade and drain briefly; discard marinade. Place
meat on a lightly greased grill 4 to 6 inches above a solid bed of
medium coals. Cook, turning often to brown evenly, until meat is no
longer pink in thickest part (cut to test), 18 to 22 minutes, or
until a thermometer inserted in center of meat (not folded end)
registers 155 degrees.
In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine lemon juice, remaining 1
tbs soy sauce, remaining 1/4 tsp coriander, cayenne, and sugar. Heat
in a microwave oven on full power (100 percent) until mixture is hot,
about 30 seconds.
Cut meat across the grain into thin, slanting slices. Spoon sauce
onto meat to taste.  Makes 4 servings.
