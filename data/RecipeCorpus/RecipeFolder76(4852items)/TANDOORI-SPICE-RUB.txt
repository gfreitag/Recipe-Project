The tandoori is an oven used in East India for Cooking. This rub will
give chicken or fish the authentic flavor of food straight out of
Bombay. It works well at high temperatures, so you can use it for
either grilling or barbequing.

Place all ingredients in a resealable plastic bag, close, and shake
to mix thoroughly.
