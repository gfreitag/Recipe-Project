1 1/4 c  Water
2 ts Of vanilla

1/2 c  Whole almonds

Here's an unusual use of the wok.  I don't usually think of fried
rice and fruit going together...

Soak the dried fruit in the water with 1 teaspoon of the vanilla for
40 minutes.

Heat the oil in a wok; add almonds and stir-fry until toasted, about 1
minute.  Remove with a slotted spoon.

Reduce the heat to moderate and add 2 tablespoons of the butter.

Add the onions and stir-fry until lightly browned.

Add 1/4 cup of the sugar and continue to stir-fry until the sugar is
melted and lightly caramelized.

Add 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon and the dried fruit mixture. Stir-
fry for 1 minute.  Remove to a bowl.

Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the wok; add rice, remaining
vanilla, sugar and the salt.  Stir-fry until rice is in separate
grains and some grains have toasted lightly.

Push the rice up the sides of the wok and pour the fruit in the
center. Mix in the rice.

Turn out onto a platter and decorate with the toasted almonds.

Sprinkle with the remaining cinnamon mixed with cloves.

Serves 4.
