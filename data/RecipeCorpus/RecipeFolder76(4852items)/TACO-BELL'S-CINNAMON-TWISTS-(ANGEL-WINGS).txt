Categories: Breads, Tex-mex, Copycat

WALDINE VAN GEFFEN
VGHC42A-----
5    Eggs yolks -- well beaten
5 tb Sour cream
5 tb Sugar
1 tb Almond extract
1/4 ts Salt
2 1/2 c  Flour
Combine all, adding each item as listed, and enough more flour so that
dough is no longer sticky, but still very soft. Roll small portions of
dough at a time to paper-thin. Use lightly floured working surface.
Cut into strips 2"x5" and arrange in single layer on oiled cookie
sheets. Bring enough oil to 400~ in deep heavy saucpan, at least 3"
deep. As you drop the dough into oil, make a 1" slit down center of
each and draw the opposite ends of the strip through the slit.
They'll fall to the bottom but will surface in a few seconds as they
brown, about 2 minutes. Lift out with tongs and drop into large
grocery sack containing about 1 lb of 10-X powdered sugar. Source:
