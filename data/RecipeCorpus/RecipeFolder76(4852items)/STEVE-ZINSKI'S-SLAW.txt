Title: STEVE ZINSKI'S SLAW
Categories: Sides
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Head cabbage
1    Carrot
1 1/2 c  Mayonnaise (Hellman's)
1/4 c  Sugar -- heaping
1/4 c  White vinegar
1 pn Celery seed
Mix mayo, sugar, vinegar, and celery seed in a bowl. Set aside. Chop
the cabbage into -small- pieces (I use the coarse cheese shredder
attachment on my Kitchenaid mixer). Grate (or finely shred) the
carrot and mix with the cabbage. Add the mayo mixture and mix well
with a large spoon. Cover and refrigerate for 4 or more hours.

Enjoy!
