Title: TEXAS HASH (SLIGHTLY ADAPTED)
Categories: Meats, Casseroles
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Ground beef (we also
-sometimes use ground
-turkey)
1 sm Onion, diced
1/2    Sweet green pepper, diced
1 sm Can tomatoes (we like to use
-the Ro-Tel tomatoes and
-green chilies here)
1 c  Cooked long-grain rice (or
-more, depending on how much
-you want/need to stretch
-it)
1/4 ts Chili powder (we use lots
-more, plus a healthy shot
-cumin)
Salt to taste
Cook the meat, onions and sweet pepper in a frying pan until the meat
is browned and the vegetables are tender. Drain off any excess fat.
Add the tomatoes, chili powder, and simmer briefly. Salt to taste.
Mix the meat mixture with the rice, and place in a casserole. Bake at
350 until the mixture is hot and lightly browned. We also like this
topped with grated cheddar or Parmesan cheese (added just before
baking).
