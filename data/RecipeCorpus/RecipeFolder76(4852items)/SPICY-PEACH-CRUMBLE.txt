SPICY PEACH CRUMBLE: This recipe is for microwave directions, but I'm
sure would be just as good if prepared in oven at 350.

To peel peaches, place in boiling water for 30 seconds, then plunge
into ice water. The skin should come off easily.

Crumb Topping (see recipe below)

Place peaches in round microwavable dish, 8 x 1-1/2 inches. Mix
remaining ingredients except Crumb Topping; toss with peaches.
Sprinkle topping over the peaches.

Microwave uncovered on HIGH 10 to 15 minutes, rotating dish 1/2 turn
every 5 minutes, until peaches are hot and bubbly. Let stand
uncovered 10 minutes. Serve warm and if desired, with whipped cream.
Makes 6 servings.

CRUMB TOPPING

1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 cup packed brown sugar 2 tblsp.
margerine or butter, softened

Mix all ingredients until crumbly.
