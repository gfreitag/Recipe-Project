Add onion to skillet; cook over medium heat, stirring, for 4 minutes
or until softened.

Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine ketchup, vinegar, Worcestershire
sauce, sugar, mustard and pepper; pour into skillet. Bring to boil;
return pork and any accumulated juices to skillet, turning to coat.
Reduce heat to simmer; cook, stirring and turning pork chops
occasionally, for about 8 minutes or just until only a hint of pink
remains inside pork chops and sauce is thickened.

If the sauce is too thick, stir in 1 tb of water at the end.
