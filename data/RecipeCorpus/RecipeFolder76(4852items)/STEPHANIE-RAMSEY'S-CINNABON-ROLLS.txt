BUNS:In small bowl, combine water, yeast and sugar. Stir until
dissolved. Set aside. In large bowl, make pudding mix according to
package directions. Add butter, eggs and salt; mix well. Add the
yeast mixture; blend. Gradually add flour and knead until smooth,
adding "sprinkles" of flour as needed to control stickiness. Once the
dough is no longer sticky and is soft and silky feeling (like as
baby's behind), the dough is ready. Place in very large greased bowl.
Cover and let rise until double in bulk (about 1 hour). Punch down
and let rise again (about 45 minutes). On a lightly floured surface,
roll out to a 34" x 21" rectangle. Spread 1 cup of melted butter over
surface. CINNABON TOPPING: In small bowl, mix brown sugar and
cinnamon together. Sprinkle all over top of surface. Roll up very
tightly. With a knife, put a notch every 2 inches. With string or
thread, place under roll by notch and criss-cross over to cut roll
(makes a nice clean cut). Place on greased baking pan, 2-inches
apart. Lightly press rolls down with your hands (just a LITTLE, it
helps to hold them together better). Cover and let rise until double
again. Bake at 350-degrees for 15 to 20 minutes. Take them out when
they JUST start to turn golden. DON'T OVER-BAKE!  Frost warm rolls
with Cream Cheese Frosting. CREAM CHEESE FROSTING: Combine all
ingredients and mix until smooth. Spread on very warm rolls. Rolls
are best when served warm. CARAMEL STICKY BUNS & TOPPING: In a sauce
pan or in your microwave oven combine butter, brown sugar and corn
syrup.  Heat and stir until blended. Pour topping into the bottom of
the pan (pans) you are using for the rolls, place unbaked cinnamon
rolls on top on the caramel sauce. Allow to rise in a warm place
until double in size (about 1 hour). Preheat oven to 350-degrees.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly brown. After removing pans
from oven, cover with foil; invert onto cooling racks, cool 1 minute,
and remove pan. Cool before serving.
