spray. Place rack in a large saucepan or dome-lidded, deep electric
skillet. Add water to a depth of 1 to 1 1/4 inches.  Bring to boiling.

Arrange potato slices over one-third of the rack. Cover and steam for
eight minutes.  Add salmon steaks and top each with two lemon slices.
Cover and steam for six minutes more. Add snow peas and mushrooms.
Cover and steam four to five minutes longer or until fish flakes

Zesty Dill Sauce preparation: In a small bowl, combine all
ingredients for sauce. Makes about six tablespoons sauce. Nutritional
information: One tablespoon of the dill sauce contains 30 calories, 3
grams of fat and 1 milligram of cholesterol.

Cook's Notes:  A 5 1/2 inch collapsible metal steamer, opened flat,
works well in a large saucepan or deep skillet. When adding foods,
cover and adjust heat to maintain water at vigorous boil. so the pan
is filled continuously with steam. Steam can burn so remove the lid
by tilting it away from your face.  Use hot pads and remove food
carefully. Check water level when steaming foods that require longer
cooking times. If necessary, add boiling water to maintain steaming
process.

Menu suggestion:  Serve with a salad of assorted salad greens (Bibb,
romaine, curly red or green lettuce) in individual salad bowls. Top
with cucumber slices and fresh grapefruit segments. Serve the salad
with your favorite reduced-calorie creamy cucumber or Italian salad
dressing.
