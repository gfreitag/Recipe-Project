Split the quail, carefully remove the back and rib bones and brush
with tamarind glaze. Grill the quail over a medium-hot fire 4 to 5
minutes, skin side down. Turn and grill another 2 to 3 minutes,
taking care not to= overcook.

Place purslane salad attractively on plates. Place grilled quail on
top and garnish with mint sprigs, arugula and flower petals.

FOR THE GLAZE:

In a small skillet over medium heat, saute the garlic, shallots and
ginger in olive oil until tender but not brown. Stir the sugar, fish
sauce, water, tamarind concentrate and the lime juice together until
well combined. Add to the garlic mixture and reduce over high heat by
one-third or until slightly thickened. Remove from the heat and let
cool. Store covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Yield: About 1/2 cup

FOR THE SALAD: Wash the purslane and discard any tough stems or
damaged leaves. Chop the onion and bell pepper and rinse in cold
water. Place the onions and peppers in a bowl along with the purslane
leaves, tomatoes, sumac, chile, lemon juice and olive oil. Gently mix
and season with salt and pepper and garnish with roasted beets.
