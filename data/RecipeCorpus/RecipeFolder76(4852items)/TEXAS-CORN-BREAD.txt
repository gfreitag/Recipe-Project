Title: TEXAS CORN BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Yellow corn meal
1/2 c  Flour
1 c  Buttermilk
1/2 c  Sweet milk
1    Egg, beaten
1/4 c  Melted butter
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Soda
1 tb Baking powder
Mix corn meal, flour and salt.  Add all the other ingredients and let
stand at least 5 minutes without mixing. Grease the skillet well and
heat it. Now stir in mixture and pour it into the skillet. Cover the
skillet and bake it on the coals, checking every few minutes to see
that the heat is right. It is cooked when the top crust is a golden
brown color. You will find that the bottom is somewhat moist at this
time. That is fine, for it should be.
