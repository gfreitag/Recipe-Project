Title: SUZY'S FAVORITE BROWNIE MUFFINS
Categories: Dessert, Muffins, Favorite, Suzy, Posted-mm
Yield: 16 Muffins
1 c  All-purpose Flour
1 1/4 c  Granulated Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1 tb Baking Powder
1 c  Unsalted Butter
4 oz Sweet Baking Chocolate
4 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Chopped pecans
MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
Chocolate Frosting
Confectioners' Sugar
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease sixteen muffin cups or use
paper/foil liners

In a large mixing bowl, stir together flour, sugar, salt and baking
powder.

In a small saucepan, melt butter and chocolate together over very low
heat. Stir chocolate mixture into flour mixture.

Add eggs and vanilla extract and mix together just until ingredients
are evenly moistened. Fold in the pecans.

Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each cup
3/4    full.

Bake for 20 min., or until springs slightly to the touch.

When cool can be frosted if desired or sift Confectioners' Sugar over
the tops.

Optional: I like to add a 1/2 cup of chocolate mini-chips to the
batter when adding the nuts.

Yields: 16 Muffins
