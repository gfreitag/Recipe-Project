Categories: Tvfn
1 md pumpkin,about 6" diameter
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  cornmeal
1 1/2 c  buttermilk
1 1/2 c  water
1 1/2 lg eggs
9 TB vegetable oil

Thoroughly clean the outside of the pumpkin. Cut off top of pumpkin
to make a lid. Remove the seeds and scrape out any stringy pulp.
Combine stuffing ingredients and mix well in a bowl. Fill the pumpkin
with the stuffing. (Be sure to leave some space at top.) Cover with
lid, and bake on an oiled cookie sheet for 50 minutes at 400 degrees.
Lower the temperature to 375 degrees for 40 minutes or until the
stuffing sets. (The stuffing is set when a fork is inserted in the
center and comes out clean.) Cut the pumpkin into eight sections and
serve the wedges topped with either cranberry sauce or gravy.
