Categories: Barry
Yield: 2 Servings
8 oz Cooked and Peeled Prawns
1 tb Cornflour
4 tb Orange Juice
1 tb Soya Sauce
1 tb Brown Sugar
1 tb Cider Vinegar
1/2 tb Ground Ginger
2 ts Oil
1 tb Tomato Puree (optional)
2 tb Crushed Pineapple (optional)
Mix the corflour with the orange juice until smooth. Put all the other
ingredients except the prawns into a saucepan, add the orange juice
and cornflour and bring to the boil, stirring regularly until thick
and smooth. If you want a reddish-coloured sauce add the tomato puree
and, if you like the flavour, add the crushed pineapple, or both. Put
in the prawns and heat through for just two minutes, Don't cook them
too long or they'll turn rubbery. Serve with plenty of rice and
stir-fried beansprouts.
