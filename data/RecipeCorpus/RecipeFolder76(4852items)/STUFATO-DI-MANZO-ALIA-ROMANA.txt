Set the oven at 350'F or Mark 4.  Heat the oil and butter in a large
flameproof casserole, put in the beef and brown on all sides, then
take out and put in the onions, garlic and pork. Fry for about 5
minutes, draw aside, shake in the flour, brown it slightly then pour
in the red wine and stock and add the bouquet garni. Season and bring
to the boil. Replace the beef, cover the casserole and braise in the
preset oven for 2 hours, basting well.  Quarter the tomatoes and add
them to the casserole 30 minutes before the end of the cooking time.
Take up the beef, carve and lay in a deep dish.  Skim the gravy,
remove the herbs, reduce gravy slightly and spoon over and round
beef. Arrange polenta balls at each end of the dish. Walt MM Taken
