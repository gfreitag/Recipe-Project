Title: SYRUPS
Categories: Canning
Yield: 1 Text  Adding syrup to canned fruit helps to retain its flavor, color, and
shape. It does not prevent spoilage of these foods. The guidelines
for preparing and using syrups (Table 1) offer a new "very light"
syrup, which approximates the natural sugar content of many fruits.
The sugar content in each of the five syrups is increased by about 10
percent. Quantities of water and sugar to make enough syrup for a
canner load of pints or quarts are provided for each syrup type.

Procedure: Heat water and sugar together. Bring to a boil and pour
over raw fruits in jars. For hot packs, bring water and sugar to
boil, add fruit, reheat to boil, and fill into jars immediately.

Other sweeteners: Light corn syrups or mild-flavored honey may be
used to replace up to half the table sugar called for in syrups. For
more information see Canned Foods for Special Diets.

Table 1. Preparing and using syrups. (Measure of Water and Sugar)

Syrup Type: Very Light.  Approx. % Sugar: 10. For 9-Pt Load: 6-1/2
Cups Water, 3/4 Cups Sugar. For 7-Qt Load: 10-1/2 Cups Water, 1-1/4
Cups Sugar. (Approximates natural sugar levels in most fruits and
adds the fewest calories.)

Syrup Type: Light.  Approx. % Sugar: 20. For 9-Pt Load: 5-3/4 Cups
Water, 1-1/2 Cups Sugar. For 7-Qt Load: 9 Cups Water, 2-1/4 Cups
Sugar. (Very sweet fruit.  Try a small amount the first time to see
if your family likes it.)

Syrup Type: Medium.  Approx. % Sugar: 30. For 9-Pt Load: 5-1/4 Cups
Water, 2-1/4 Cups Sugar. For 7-Qt Load: 8-1/4 Cups Water, 3-3/4 Cups
Sugar. (Sweet apples, sweet cherries, berries, grapes.)

Syrup Type: Heavy.  Approx % Sugar: 40. For 9-Pt Load: 5 Cups Water,
3-1/4 Cups Sugar. For 7-Qt Load: 7-3/4 Cups Water, 5-1/4 Cups Sugar.
(Tart apples, apricots, sour cherries, gooseberries, nectarines,
peaches, pears, plums.)

Syrup Type: Very Heavy.  Approx % Sugar: 50. For 9-Pt Load: 4-1/4 Cups
Water, 4-1/4 Cups Sugar For 7-Qt Load: 6-1/2 Cups Water, 6-3/4 Cups
Sugar Very sour fruit. Try a small amount the first time to see if
your family likes it.

NOTES:

9-Pt Load values are also adequate for a 4-quart load.

Many fruits that are typically packed in heavy syrup are excellent and
tasteful products when packed in lighter syrups. It is recommended
that lighter syrups be tried, since they contain fewer calories from
added sugar
