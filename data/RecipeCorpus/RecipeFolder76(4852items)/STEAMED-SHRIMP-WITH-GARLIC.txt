Categories: Seafood, Steamer
Yield: 4 Servings
20 md Shrimp
4 tb Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Finely minced garlic
4 tb Chopped scallions
2 tb Light soy sauce

Remove shells from the shrimp, leaving the tail sections on, and
butterfly the shrimp by slicing them down the back, not quite in
half. Rinse well and remove the dark vein from each. Drain and pat
dry. Place the shrimp on a platter in one layer

Heat the oil in a wok or skillet; add the garlic. Lower the heat and
cook about 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until the garlic turns
brown. Raise the heat, add the scallions and cook 30 seconds. Add the
light soy sauce, rice wine and sugar and stir for 30 seconds.

Place the dish with the shrimp into a steamer and cover each shrimp
with a teaspoon of the garlic mixture. Cover and steam the shrimp for
6 minutes. Serve immediately.
