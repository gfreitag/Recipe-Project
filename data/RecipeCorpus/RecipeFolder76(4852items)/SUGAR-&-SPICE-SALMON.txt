Title: SUGAR & SPICE SALMON
Categories: Fish, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 c  Gin
1/3 c  Brown sugar
3 tb Coarse salt
1 1/2 tb Mixed pickling spice
1 ts Anise seed, bruised*
1 ts Dil seed, bruised*
1 1/2 lb Salmon filet
At least 2 hours and up to 6 hours before you plan to smoke the fish,
combine marinade ingrdients in a bowl. Place salmon in a plastic bag
or shallow dish, pour marinade over it, and refrigerate it for at
least 1 hour.

Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature.

Remove salmon from refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature
for 30 minutes.  Drain salmon, reserving marinade. Leave any clinging
spices on the surface of the salmon.

Transfer salmon to smoker, skin-side down, and drizzle marinade (with
some of the whole spices) generously over fish. Smoke it until just
cooked through and flaky, about 45 to 55 minutes at a temperature of
225 to 250F.
Have a large spatula and platter ready when you take the salmon off
the smoker, since it will be fragile when done.

Transfer salmon to the serving platter.  Serve it hot or chilled with
some of the whole spices clinging to the fish.

*Bruising technique:  Bruising spices means to almost ~ but not quite
~ crush the whole spice seeds or pods. by pressing on the spices with
a pestle or the side of a knife, you release the natural oils, making
the seasonings more flavorful.
