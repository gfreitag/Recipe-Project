Some cooks are surprised to see ketchup used in Chinese cooking. They
might be less surprised if they knew that the name (and the
condiment) came from Asia in the first place. "Ketjap" (or "kecap",
both pronounced the same) is a Malay word meaning "seasoned Sauce."

Preparation:

Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper and set aside.

Combine sweet and sour sauce ingredients in a medium bowl and set
aside.

Place flour, egg and cornstarch in separate bowls. Coat each piece of
fish with flour, shaking off excess. Dip fish in egg, then dredge with
cornstarch. Set aside for 10 minutes.

Cooking:

Set wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of about 2 inches.
Over high heat, bring oil to 360 deg.F. Add fish,a few pieces at a
time, and cook for 4 minutes or until golden brown. Lift out and
drain on paper towels. Keep warm in a 200 deg.F oven while cooking
remaining fish.

Bring sauce to a boil over medium-high heat. Add carrot and green
onion and cook for 30 seconds. Add cornstarch solution and cook,
stirring until sauce boils and thickens.

Pour sauce on a platter. Arrange fish over sauce and serve
immediately.
