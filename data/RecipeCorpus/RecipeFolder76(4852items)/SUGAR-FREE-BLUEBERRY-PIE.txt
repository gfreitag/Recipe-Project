Categories: Pies, Desserts, Diabetic
Yield: 8 Servings
1    Recipe pastry crust
4 c  Blueberries

8 dr -OR up to...
10 dr Liquid butter flavoring.
LIne 10" pie plate with crust

Pick over, wash and drain berries.

Mix next 6 ingredients together in small bowl

Toss with berries being careful to not crush the berries too much pour
berries in crust, making sure all the "goodies" are scraped from the
bowl.

Cover with top crust, slit for steam to escape.

Bake at 425 for 10 minutes, reduce heat to 325 for 45 minutes or until
crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly.

For a little added flavor to the crust you can sprinkle with a light
mixture of Sweet and Low and cinnamon.

Cool on wire rack, serve with dollop of Lite Cool Whip or small scoop
of vanilla ice cream if desired.

Exchanges, Pie only - 1/8 pie equals 1 fruit, 1 1/2 starch, 1 1/2 fat

I usually put a large piece of foil or a cookie sheet under the pie to
assure that no juices escape into the oven.
