Strawberries with Jazzed up Whipped Cream xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xx

This idea came to me yesterday when I bought my first basket of Oregon
strawberries for this season.  Brag all you want about your regional
products, but there is nowhere on this earth where strawberries are
sweeter or tastier than in Oregon, especially around the Portland
metro area.

Whip cream, add Kahlua during final stage. Place sliced pound cake on
a plate, top with berries and slather on whipped cream.

These recipes are of my own creation and I expect (and deserve)
appropriate credit when you add them to your cookbook
