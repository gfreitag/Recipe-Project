Title: THAI RIBBONS
Categories: Thai, Beef

1 lb Round or flank steak
3 tb Soy sauce
3 tb Rice wine or sherry
3    Cloves garlic, finely

2 tb Finely chopped ginger
1/2 ts Dried hot chili pepper
Cut steak across the grain into 1/4 inch slices.  In a shallow
casserole, mix together remaining ingredients. Add meat, cover and
refrigerate for at least 4 hours, overnight if possible. Soak bamboo
skewers in water for 30 minutes before threading with meat. This
prevents them from burning. Remove meat and reserve marinade. Thread
each slice lengthwise onto a bamboo skewer, in an interlacing
fashion. Broil ribbons or grill on a hot barbecue for 3-4 minutes per
side,basting with reserved marinade. Makes about 30 ribbons or 15
appetizer servings.
