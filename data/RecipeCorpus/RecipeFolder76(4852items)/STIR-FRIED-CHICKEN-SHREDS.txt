Categories: Oriental, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Boneless chicken breasts
- skinned
1    Egg white
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cornstarch
6 oz Fresh bean sprouts
4 oz Snow peas; trimmed
6    Fresh water chestnuts; -OR-
4 oz -Canned water chestnuts

2/3 c  Oil, preferably peanut
1 ts Salt
CUT THE CHICKEN INTO VERY THIN shreds and combine these with the egg
white, salt and cornstarch in a bowl. Mix well and chill in the
refrigerator for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, trim the bean sprouts,
finely shred the snow peas lengthwise, and shred or slice the water
chestnuts. Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet and when it is
almost smoking, add the chicken. Stir- fry quickly for 1 minute.
Drain the chicken in a colander or sieve immediately. Pour off the
oil, leaving 1 tablespoon in the wok. (The rest of the oil may be
saved when it is cooled and used for future cooking with chicken.)
Reheat the wok and stir-fry the vegetables for 2 minutes. Return the
drained chicken to the pan, stir to mix well, and add the salt. Give
the mixture a few more stirs and then turn it onto a warm serving
platter.
