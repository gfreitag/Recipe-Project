Title: SUNBEAM TAPIOCA
Categories: Desserts, Low-fat
Yield: 4 Servings
3 tb Instant tapioca
1 c  Pineapple juice
1 c  Orange juice
1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 c  Mandarin orange sections
-- (canned), drained
1 c  Canned pineapple
-- (crushed or tidbits),
-- drained
Combine the instant tapioca, pineapple juice, and orange juice in a
saucepan.  Cook and stir over medium heat until the mixture comes to a
boil.  Remove from heat; add the lemon juice. Cool, stirring
occasionally. Add the fruit and chill until firm.

HINTS: I used the 'packed in their own juices' tinned fruit, and so
used the juice from the tins plus some water and OJ to make up the
difference.
