The origin was when I was a college student (won't say how long ago).
We were all broke, except that one member of the group had a typical
Italian Mama who sent periodic care packages of exotic goodies.
Another member liked to fish, so we came up with:

Drain artichoke hearts, reserving oil.  Place oil in a small saucepan,
along with almonds, butter, cheese and herbs/spices. Heat until
flavors are well combined.

Meanwhile, place fish fillets in an ovenproof baking dish, folding if
necessary to make an attractive presentation. Chop artichoke hearts,
or arrange hearts to cover fish attractivelyu (a subject of some
debate, I vote for cutting the hearts into attractive portions, and
covering the fish)

Pour the oil/butter/cheese, etc. mixture over the fish, place in a
preheated 350 oven, and bake until the fish barely flakes. (10
minutes or less).

Serve with pasta dressed with oil, garlic and cheese, a green
vegetable. Kathy in Bryan, TX
