Fresh pork lends itself well to steaming, either cubed, sliced or
minced, and combined or topped with "flavoring" ingredients.

Preparation:  Mix marinade. In bowl, mix chopped pork, water chest-
nuts, 1/2 preserved vegetable, & marinade; mix together with your
fingers - it's faster.  Spread mixture on round 12" plate.  Sprinkle
with remaining preserved vegetable.  Refrigerate if working in ad-
vance.

Steaming:  Bring pork mixture to room temperature before steaming.
Bring water in steamer to rapid boil. Steam for about 20 minutes.
Sprinkle with chopped onions just before serving.
