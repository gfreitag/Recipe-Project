MMMMM----------------STEWED FIGS WITH VARIATIONS---------------------
The easiest and most popular method of preparing California figs is by
stewing -- and there are many delightful variations on this delicious
theme. Rinse and drain figs, cover generously with water, cover the
pan, and cook slowly over low heat for 35 minutes. Add sugar if you
wish after cooking.

To vary:

Add a half-slice of orange for every six figs.  Simmer five minutes
more. Serve room warm.

Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice for every four or five figs, with a piece
of lemon rind.  Simmer five minutes more. Serve either warm or
chilled.

Add 1 teaspoon California sherry for every six figs, after figs are
thoroughly cooked.  Chill before serving.

Add either a piece of gingerroot or stick of cinnamon to cook slowly
with figs.

Stewed figs will keep very well in the refrigerator for use at
breakfast, as a meal-starter, or as a healthful and delicious dessert.
