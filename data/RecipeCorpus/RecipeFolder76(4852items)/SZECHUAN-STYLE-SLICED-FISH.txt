Title: SZECHUAN-STYLE SLICED FISH
Categories: Chinese, Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb FRESH RED SNAPPER OR
-GROUPER
1 ts CORNSTARCH
1    EGG WHITE
1 ts PEANUT OIL
1 oz TREE EARS
1 lg RED BELL PEPPER
2 oz SNOW PEAS
2 oz WATER CHESTNUTS
1    IN. PEELED GINGER ROOT
1    SCALLION
1 ts MINCED GARLIC
2 tb SOY SAUCE
1/2 c  CHICKEN BROTH
1/2 tb SUGAR
1/2 tb VINEGAR
1 tb CORNSTARCH
1 tb SHERRY
2 c  PEANUT OIL, FOR FRYING
Slice the fish into pieces 1/3 in. thick and 2 in. square. Combine
the fish with the corn- starch, egg white, and 1 tsp. peanut oil, and
let stand for 20 minutes. Cover the tree ears with warm water and let
stand for 20 minutes. Core and seed the red pepper and cut it into 1
in. squares. Snap the snow peas. Rinse the water chestnuts. Cut the
ginger into thin sli- vers, the scallion, into thin slices, and fine-
ly chop the garlic. Combine the ingredients for the sauce. Heat the
oil in a wok or frying pan- it should be very hot before adding the
fish. Add the fish, piece by piece, and cook for 1 minute. Transfer
the fish with a slotted spoon to a strainer over a bowl to catch the
oil. Discard all but 1/4 cup oil from wok and heat it again. Add the
ginger, scallion, and garlic, and stir-fry over high heat for 10
seconds. Add the pepper, water chestnuts, and pea pods, and stir-fry
for 1 minute. Add the tree ear and fish. Thoroughly mix the sauce and
add it to the wok. Cook the fish, stirring gently, for 1 minute, or
until the sauce thickens. This recipe calls for a slippery black
fungus called tree ears in North America, cloud ears in China, and
jelly mushrooms in Thailand. Tree ears have very little flavor and
are chiefly prized for their slippery, crisp consistency. Available
dried at Oriental markets, tree ears will keep indefinately. They
need only be soak- ed in warm water for 20 minutes before using.
