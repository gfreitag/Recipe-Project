1 1/2 lb Large shrimp
3 tb Oil; preferably canola or
-corn
2 md Onions; chopped
2    Garlic cloves; minced
1 lg Green bell pepper; chopped
1/4 c  Roasted green chile;
-preferably Poblano or New
-Mexican, fresh or frozen
1 ts Cumin seeds; toasted and

1 ts Dried oregano; preferably
-Mexican
1 ts White pepper
1 ts ;salt
1    Bay leaf
1 1/2 c  Rice; uncooked
3 c  Shrimp or seafood stock
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
6    Green onions; sliced
1/2 c  Cilantro; chopped
Peel, and, if you wish, devein the shrimp.  Save the shells for stock.
Refrigerate the shrimp until you are ready to use them.

Warm the oil in a heavy skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add
the onions, garlic, green pepper, and green chile, and saute them,
stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened, about 5
minutes. Add the dried seasonings and the rice, stirring to coat all
the grains, and cook another couple of minutes. Add the stock and the
lemon juice, and bring the liquid to a boil.  Cover the skillet,
reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer 18 minutes. Check the
mixture toward the end of the cooking time, and stir if the rice
appears to be sticking.  Add the shrimp and the sliced green onions,
stirring to incorporate them. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more.

Remove the skillet from the heat, and let the shrimp and rice sit,
covered, for 10 minutes.  Then sprinkle the cilantro over the dish,
and serve it immediately. Eat any leftovers the next day. Source:
