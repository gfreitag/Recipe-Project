Categories: Diabetic, Poultry, Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Cornish game hens
4    Tangerines, peeled,
-seeded, & chopped
1 c  Fresh squeezed orange juice
1/4 c  Zinfandel wine
1 ts Or salt to taste

*NOTE: optional Rinse hens and pat dry. Mix wine, soy sauce, salt,
honey & orange juice together. Rub 1 Tblpsn butter inside each hen.
Sprinkle the cavity with salt. Mix the onion, garlic, pecans,
mushrooms, & tangerines together. Stuff each hen with this mixture.
Heat the liquid mixture until it begins to boil. Turn off & let cool
for 5 minutes. Pour 2 Tblspns of this into each hen. Preheat oven to
325 degrees F then bake hens for 45 minutes. Be sure to baste every
10 minutes with the liquid mixture. Test birds...if not done....cook
until done. **NOTE** I have used this same thing on chickens too as
well Guinea hens. All came out well as did the quail I used it with.
