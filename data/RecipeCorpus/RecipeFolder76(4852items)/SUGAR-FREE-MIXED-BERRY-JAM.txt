Title: SUGAR-FREE MIXED BERRY JAM
Categories: Preserves, Fruits
Yield: 3 Cups
3/4 pt Strawberries; hulled
3/4 pt Blackberries
3/4 pt Gooseberries; trimmed
1 c  Apple juice concentrate
Rinse and drain berries.  Place half of the berries in a blender or
food processor and puree.  Transfer pureed berries to a saucepan
along with unprocessed berries. Simmer mixture gently until fruit is
cooked. Stir in the apple juice concentrate and boil for 15 minutes,
until mixture reaches setting point (220 F. on a candy thermometer).
Mixture is ready when a teaspoonful chilled on a saucer a few minutes
in the freezer does not flow back together when you run a finger
through it.

Remove from heat and pour into sterilized jars.  Seal according to jar
manufacturer's instructions.  Store in a cool place up to 4 weeks, or
in the refrigerator.
