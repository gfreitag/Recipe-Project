Serve this pleasant and unusual entree with sprigs of watercress
dipped in a well-flavoured vinaigrette.

Cut three green cucumbers in half lengthwise.  Scoop out and discard
the seeds, then hollow much of the cucumber flesh out to leave green
shells. Chop the flesh and put it on kitchen paper to drain. Mince or
chop finely 150 g smoked pork loin or ham and 35 g bacon. In a bowl,
combine this mince with the cucumber flesh, 150 g lean minced beef,
20 g crushed garlic, 75 g chopped shallots, 50 g chopped parsley, a
generous tablespoon of chopped fresh tarragon, 1 tablespoon paprika
and salt and pepper. Break two eggs into the bowl and stir the
mixture until well- blended. Use to stuff the cucumber shells and
bake the shells for 45 minutes in a preheated 200C oven.

Makes 6 servings.
