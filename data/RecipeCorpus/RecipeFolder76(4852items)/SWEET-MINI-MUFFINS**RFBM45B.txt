Title: SWEET MINI-MUFFINS**RFBM45B
Categories: Breads, Gifts, Muffins
Yield: 18 Servings
1/4 c  Butter or margarine, at room
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ea Egg
2 c  Flour
4 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Each salt and ground nutmeg
1 c  Milk
1/2 c  Butter or margarine, melted
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 x  Mixed with
1/2 c  Sugar
In s med-size bowl, beat together the 1/4 c butter and the 1/2 c sugar
until blended, then beat in egg.  Sift together flour, baking powder,
salt, and nutmeg. Stir dry ingredients into butter mixture
alternately with milk, blending well after each addition.   Spoon
batter into greased 1 1/2" muffin cups, filling 2/3 to 3/4 full. Bake
in a 375 oven until golden grown (12-18 minutes). Remove from pans.
While muffins are still hot, dip each into melted butter, coating
evenly; then roll in cinnamon-sugar mixture. Place on a plate and let
cool completely. Wrap airtight; store at room temp for up to 1 day,
in freezer for up to 1 month (thaw forzen muffins unwrapped).  On
gift tag, suggest reheating muffins before serving: arrange on a
baking sheet, cover loosely with foil, and heat in a 350 oven for
about 10 min.  Makes 3 dozen mini-muffins. I have made these as full
size muffins many times for breakfast and they're always a hit.
Hope you like them!
