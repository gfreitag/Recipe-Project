Title: TEISEN MEL ( TRADITIONAL WELSH HONEYCAKE )
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 lb Plain white household flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 lb Runny honey
1 tb Runny honey
1/4 lb Butter
1/4 lb Caster sugar
2    Large eggs
1 tb Milk (or double this amount)
Sieve the flour, raising agent and spice into a bowl. Lightly grease
a tin pie plate measuring about 8-1/2-inches across the top. Cream
the butter with 3 oz sugar until creamy and light. Add the egg yolks
then the 1/4 lb honey, gradually. Gently mix in the flour, then the
milk. Spread the mixture in the prepared tin, mounding it slightly in
the centre, and then bake at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for about half
an hour. Let the cake rest in its tin for 2 minutes before turning it
out on to a wire rack. Let it cool for 10 minutes then slide it on to
a baking tray and brush the top with 1 tablespoon warmed honey - or
redcurrant jelly if you prefer. Whisk the egg whites and the
remaining 1 oz sugar to make a glossy meringue mixture. Swirl this
over the top of the cake and bake at 325 F (160 C) gas mark 3 for
about 20 minutes. Serve the cake when it is cold. Makes 1 cake.
