1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 ts Dry mustard
1 tb Onion juice
1/3 c  Cider vinegar
1 c  Oil
1 tb Poppy seeds
MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
1    Head red lettuce
2 bn Of spinach
1/2 lb Bacon
1    Hard boiled egg
This is the first salad I ever tasted that I actually LIKED rather
than just endured.  And that was when I was in my early thirties! I
got it from my cousin and she got it originally from Sunset Magazine
if I remember correctly.  At any rate it's excellent.  One of the few
salads that I consider a full meal in itself. The dressing has become
my house dressing. I usually make a double recipe. Keeps good in the
fridge.

Mix the dressing ingredients and set aside to blend flavors. Clean the
spinach and lettuce and tear into pieces. Fry the bacon crisp and
crumble it into not-too-small pieces. Chop the egg coarsely. Toss it
all together and add dressing to taste.
