Someone wanted a blue cheese vinaigrette recipe a while back. I
really like this one, which comes from a nifty little recipe book I
got for subscribing to Bon Appetit a year or two ago. It calls for
stilton but I use whatever blue cheese (gorgonzola, Roquefort) comes
to hand or seems most affordable at the time.
