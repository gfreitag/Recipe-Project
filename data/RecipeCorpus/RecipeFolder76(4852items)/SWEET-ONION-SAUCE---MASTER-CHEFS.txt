For Sweet Onion Sauce: ======================

In a heavy saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat,
then add onion and meat.  Cook uncovered, shaking the pan and
stirring occasionally, until the meat and the onion are browned
(about 20 minutes.)

Add the vermouth, stirring, to the meat and onions. Then add the
stock and bring the mixture to a boil. Allow the mixture to boil
gently, skimming the surface often until sauce has reduced to a light
syrupy consistency (about 30 minutes or longer.)

Remove the saucepan from the heat and swirl in 2 tablespoons of
butter, bit by bit.  Strain the resulting sauce and season with a
little bit salt and pepper.
Warm the sauce.  Spoon some sauce around the crepes, and serve.
