Categories: Chinese, Seafood

1 lb Large Raw Shrimp (25 To 30

Deveined
1 tb Rice Wine Or Dry Sherry
1 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Salad Oil
4    Green Onions, (Including The

For a Chinese-style feast, offer this exquisite stir-fry with steamed
rice and ginger-seasoned cooked carrots. (Be sure you have all of the
ingredients ready before you start to cook, since stir-frying goes
very quickly.)

In a small bowl, mix the shrimp with the wine and cornstarch.

Heat the oil in a wok or wide frying pan over high heat. Add the
shrimp mixture and cook, stirring, until the shrimp turn bright pink,
(2 to 3 minutes). Add the onions and continue to cook, stirring,
until the shrimp are just opaque in the center, cutting to test,
(about 2 more minutes). Offer soy sauce to add to the taste, if
desired.
