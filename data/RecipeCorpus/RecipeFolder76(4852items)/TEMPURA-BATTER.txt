Title: TEMPURA BATTER
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
3/4 c  Flour
1/4 c  Cornstarch
1/2 ts Baking Powder
1/4 ts Baking Soda
1 c  Water
1    Egg
Makes enough batter to coat about 2 pounds fish or chicken or
vegetables.

Sift together flour, cornstarch, baking powder and baking soda. Stir
in water, then egg; beat with rotary beater or wire whip until smooth
and frothy. For an even better fry... dredge the meat or vegetable in
milk then plain flour, then refrigerate for 1-2 hours before dipping
in Tempura.

[Use ice water in tempura batter. The colder it is the better the
results. S.C.]
