Have everything prepared before you start this dish. Clean the
shrimp and pat dry on paper towels.
Heat a wok or large heavy frying pan over highest heat. When hot
add the oil, salt and garlic and toss for just a few seconds. The
garlic should change color right away. Add the shrimp and toss
constantly until the all change to a bright orange color.  Throw in
the green onions and sesame oil and toss for a few seconds more. Add
the sherry and cover the pan. Turn off the heat and serve immediately.
