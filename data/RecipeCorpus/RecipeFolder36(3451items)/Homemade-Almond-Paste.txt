Title: Homemade Almond Paste
Categories: Holiday, Cake/cookie
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Almond extract
Cream (optional)
2 tb Butter
2 c  Sifted icing sugar
2    Egg yolks
Cream the butter and icing sugar. Add the egg yolks and beat. Stir in
the almond extract. If the mixture is not moist enough, add a few
drops of cream.
After you have spread this paste over the cake, store the cake in a
