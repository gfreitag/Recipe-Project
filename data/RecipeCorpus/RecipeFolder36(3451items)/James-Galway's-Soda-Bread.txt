Title: James Galway's Soda Bread
Categories: Breads, Scot/irish, Guestchefs
Yield: 1 loaf
1 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
1 lb Flour
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
The traditional bread of Ireland

Sift flour, salt, sugar & baking soda together a few times to mix the
thoroughly. Make a well in the centre & stir in the buttermilk
gradually to make a soft dough. Turn out on a floured board & knead
lightly for a few minutes. Flatten it out to about 1/2" thick. With a
floured knife, cut a cross on it to help it cook evenly throughout.

Bake at once in a hot oven (450F, Gas 8, 230C) for 45 min. To test
whether the cake is done or not, tap the bottom - if cooked it should
sound hollow.
