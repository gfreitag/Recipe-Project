Categories: Poultry, Meats, Chinese, Guestchefs
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Water chestnut powder
-=OR=- Flour OR Cornstarch
4 c  Peanut oil; for deep-frying
4 sl Smithfield ham (thin)
1    Whole chicken breast
- boned and butterflied
4    Pieces fresh caul fat
MMMMM----------------------VEGETABLE SAUCE---------------------------
- cut in 3-in pieces
1 tb Light soy sauce
1 tb Chinese rice wine
-=OR=- Dry Sherry
1/2 c  Chicken broth
1 ts Cornstarch; dissolved in
1 tb Chicken broth; (cold)
2 tb Peanut oil
2    Whole garlic cloves; crushed
2 sl Fresh ginger root
4    Fresh water chestnuts
- peeled & sliced lengthwise
1/2 c  Bamboo shoots
- sliced lengthwise
4    Whole scallions
LAY 2 SLICES OF HAM on 1 side of the butterflied breast. Refold the
breast, enclosing the ham. Lay the breast on a sheet of caul fat.
Roll up tight. The caul is sticky, so it needs nothing to seal it.
Dust the surface with water chestnut powder, flour or cornstarch.
Shake off the excess. Heat the oil in a wok to 350F (moderate). Slide
the chicken breasts into the oil, 1 by 1. When they have browned
(about 5 minutes), remove 1 from the oil and press it. If it feels
mushy, it needs more cooking. Remove and drain the chicken. Slice the
chicken, crosswise diagonally, into 1/2-inch pieces.

VEGETABLE SAUCE: Heat the oil in a wok and flavor with garlic and
ginger. Remove the garlic and ginger and add the water chestnuts,
bamboo shoots and scallions to the wok. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, then
add soy sauce, wine or sherry, and chicken broth. When the liquid
boils, stir in the dissolved cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Spread
the sauce on a platter as a bed for the sliced chicken breast.
