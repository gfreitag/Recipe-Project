Title: Michael Loo's Lobster Stew
Categories: Guestchefs, Fish/seafoo, Soup/stew
Yield: 6 to 8
Sherry to taste
1 tb Beurre manie (equal flour
-and butter creamed
-together, optional)
11 oz Can lobster meat
1 qt Milk
3 c  Cream
4 tb Butter
Salt, pepper,
For 1 can of lobster meat, allow 3 times that amount of milk, 2 times
that amount of cream, and 1 teaspoon of butter per ounce of lobster.
Also salt, pepper, sherry to taste. Also, if you like a thick soup,
you can make a beurre manie: mash together 1 1/2 t each flour and
butter until it's a smooth paste.

Heat milk and cream together to the boiling point. In a soup kettle,
saute the lobster in half the butter for a very brief time. Then add
the simmering liquid. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper as
necessary, and a splash of sherry or brandy if you wish. Thicken as
desired by raising the heat to the boil and stirring in the beurre
manie, then lowering the heat to low and cooking until thick: I would
not do this, because I like thin stew. But I might be inclined to
reverse the ratio of cream to milk, or just use cream for the whole
thing. Pour into warmed soup plates or bowls and float a pat of
butter on each serving.
