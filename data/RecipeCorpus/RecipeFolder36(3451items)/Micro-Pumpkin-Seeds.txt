You clean the seeds out of the pumpkin, dry them with a paper towel
(pat dry, no need to rinse with water).  Prepare a glass baking dish
by spraying lightly with PAM.  Place the seeds in the glass
dish and sprinkle with salt or any other seasoning you might prefer.
Place the dish in the microwave and cook for 6 minutes, stirring the
seeds after every minute.
