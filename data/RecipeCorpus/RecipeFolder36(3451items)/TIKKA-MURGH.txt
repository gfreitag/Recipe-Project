MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1/2 ts Red Chilli Powder
1/4 ts Tumeric

Clean, remove skin and debone chicken.  Cut each leg into 4 pieces -
24 tikka in all.

Whisk yoghurt in a large bowl, add the remaining ingredients and mix
well. Rub the chicken pieces with this mixture.  Keep aside for 3 1/2
hours.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Skewer the marinated tikka at least an inch apart. Keep a tray
underneath to collect the drippings.

Roast in a moderately hot tandoor for 6-7 minutes, basting at least
once. In a charcoal grill, for about the same time, basting once. In
a pre-heated oven, roast the tikka for 8-10 minutes, basting at least
twice. Make sure that the chicken does not touch the sides or the
bottom of the oven.
