To Make Molasses Glaze:
In medium bowl combine molasses, bottled hot pepper sauce, ginger,
garlic, and coarsely ground black pepper.  Mix well and set aside.

To Make Roast Goose:
Preheat oven to 425F. Remove giblets from goose to use another
time. Rinse goose in cold water, removing as much fat as possible
from body cavity.  Pat goose dry with paper towels.
Pierce skin all over with tines of large fork.  Season goose with
salt insode and out.  Arrange beast side up on rack in large shallow
roasting pan.
Roast at 425F for 15 minutes.
Reduce oven temperature to 350F.  Continue roasting for 20 to 23
minutes  per pound until thermometer inserted between leg and thickest
part of thigh registers 180F.  (Make sure thermometer does not touch
bone.)
Drain off all fat from pan.  Brush some of molasses glaze
completely over goose.  Continue roasting 20 minutes, brushing with
molasses mixture after 10 minutes.
Remove goose from oven.  Cover with foil and let stand 15 minutes
before carving.

To Make Apricot Stuffing:
While goose is roasting, butter deep 1-1/2 quart casserole.  In
medium skillet, saute onion and celery in hot oil over medium-high
heat until soft, about 4 to 5 minutes.
Pour into large bowl.  Add garlic, cracked pepper, thyme, parsley,
sage, apricots, corn bread, and salt to taste.  Toss to mix.  Set
aside.
In small bowl whisk together egg and stock.  Pour over stuffing.
Mix well.  (Mixture will seem soupy.)  Pour into baking dish.
Bake at 350F for 40 minutes until hot in center.

To serve the whole thing:
Arrange goose on serving platter.  Garnish with apples and grapes.
Carve goose.  Serve with apricot stuffing.
Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
