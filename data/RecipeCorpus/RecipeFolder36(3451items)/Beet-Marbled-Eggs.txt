Title: Beet Marbled Eggs
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 text file  Re: Pickled eggs and beets

Here's a neat little trick that you may or may not know, Neysa.  When
you drop the [hard cooked] eggs into the beet juice, DO NOT peel
them. Instead, bash them around a bit to crack the shells really
well, then drop 'em, shells still on, in the juice.

Drain and shell before serving.  (Sorry for insulting your
intelligence with the last direction, but someone, somewhere out
there is going to miss this step :-)

The result is a pickled egg that looks remarkably like the pretty
marble eggs you can buy for decoration.  They make a beautiful
garnish for a cold meat platter, and amazing looking deviled eggs.
