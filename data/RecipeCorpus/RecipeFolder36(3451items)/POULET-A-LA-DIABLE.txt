Title: POULET A LA DIABLE
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 2 servings
1 tb Mustard; coarse grain
3 tb Vermouth
3 tb Water
2 tb Heavy cream
1 tb Butter or margarine
1 tb Vegetable oil
2    Chicken breast halves
1 tb Dijon mustard
Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed casserole.  Add the oil.  Brown
the chicken on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes each side.  Carefully
pour off any excess fat.  Add the mustards, vermouth and water. Bring
the liquid to a simmer, scraping up the brown bits in the bottom of
the pan. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes.  Test the chicken to make
sure it is done. (Stick the point of a knife into the meat near the
bone. If the juices run clear, the chicken is cooked.) Remove the
meat to individual dishes and cover to keep warm.  Add the cream and
salt and pepper to taste. Mix well.
