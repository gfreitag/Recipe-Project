NOTE: To soften the ice cream, break it up in a mixing bowl by
stirring with a wooden spoon. Do not let the ice cream reach the
melting point. you know, you can change the "rules" and substitute
chocolate or other ice cream flavors for the vanilla. It might not be
the traditional way, but it'll still be good.. and different.
