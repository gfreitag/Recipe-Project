This recipe calls for red pie cherries enhanced with a little kirsch
and topped with a shortcake biscuit featuring cream cheese and
chopped pecans.

Preheat oven to 425^F Grease an 8-inch square baking pan or dish.
In a large mixing bowl, carefully spoon together cherries, juice,
brown sugar, tapioca and kirsch. Pour cherry filling into greased
baking pan or dish; drizzle melted butter or margarine on top and set
aside.

In another large bowl, combine crust ingredients. Stir vigorously
with a wooden spoon about 30 seconds until a stiff dough forms.
Spoon cream-cheese dough on top of cherry-kirsch filling to create a
cobblestone effect. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until crust is golden
brown. Cool 30 minutes; then serve with kirsch-flavored whipped cream.

Makes 5 or 6 servings.
