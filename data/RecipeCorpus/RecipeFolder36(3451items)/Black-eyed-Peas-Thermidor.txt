Title: Black-eyed Peas Thermidor
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Dry english mustard powder
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 c  Spinach leaves, drained
Salt and pepper to taste
1 c  Dried black-eyed peas
3 c  Chicken stock
1    Clove
1 md Bay leaf
1 md Yellow onion(s), peeled
Place beans in colander, rinse, and pick over them. Put beans in large
stockpot, cover with cold water, and soak for at least 3 hours, or
overnight.

Drain beans, return to the pot, and cover with the chicken stock.
Using the clove as a pin, attach the bay leaf to the whole onion. Add
the studded onion to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and
cook, uncovered, until the peas are tender, about 45 min to 1 hour.
Drain the peas, reserving the stock in a clean bowl. Discard the
studded onion. Return the peas to the pot and cover.

Place the mustard powder in a small bowl and gradually mix in 1 tsp
water or cream to make a loose paste (add more water if needed). Fold
the mustard paste,  1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and the cooked spinach
into the reserved chicken stock. Mix the chicken stock mixture back
into the peas, then fold in the cream. Season with salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.

Pour the peas into a casserole dish. Sprinkle the top of the peas
with the remaining Parmesan cheese and bake for 30 min or until the
cheese browns. Remove from the oven and serve immediately.
