Makes 40 sugar plums

In food processor, coarsely chop the dried fruit.  Set aside.
Coarsely chop the nuts with the ginger.  In bowl, combine the chopped
fruit and nuts, along with the lemon peel and Armagnac.  Then mix
together using your hands.  Place the sugar in a seperate dish to use
for coating the 'plums'.  With hands, roll and form fruit-nut balls,
about 1 inch in size.  Roll in sugar and set aside.  Store in covered
container. Refrigerate.  Will 'sit' in fridge for up to two weeks.
Can also be frozen.
