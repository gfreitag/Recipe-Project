Place beans in colander, rinse, and pick over them. Put beans in large
stockpot, cover with cold water, and soak for at least 3 hours, or
overnight.

Drain beans and cover with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then remove
from the heat, drain, and rinse under cold running water. Return the
chick-peas to the pot, cover with fresh water, and simmer over
medium-low heat, covered, for 1 hour or until the beans are tender,
skimming the surface from time to time to remove any scum that rise
to the surface. Drain the chick-peas, then return to the pot. Cover
and keep warm.

Heat the olive oil in a heavy skillet over high heat. Add the
scallions and garlic to the pan and saute for 1 min. Add the
chick-peas, lemon juice, salt and pepper, and stir to mix well. Serve.
