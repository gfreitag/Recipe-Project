Categories: Fish/seafoo, Guestchefs
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 oz Dry white breadcrumbs
1 ts Dry sherry
Pepper
4 oz Bay scallops
1 tb Sweet sherry
1/8 ts Salt

Preheat oven to 550. Turn setting to Broil.

If using cheap scallops, add sweet sherry and salt and marinate for
awhile. Melt the butter. Put half into a serving casserole and mix
the other half with the breadcrumbs.

Put scallops into butter-bottomed casserole and top with crumbs.
Sprinkle sherry and pepper over. Broil until crumbs are golden, just
a few minutes.
