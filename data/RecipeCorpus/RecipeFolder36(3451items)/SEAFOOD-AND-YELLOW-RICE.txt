Title: SEAFOOD AND YELLOW RICE
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Nuts/grains, Oldies
Yield: 1 batch
Parsley, chopped
Garlic, minced
Salt, to taste
Black pepper, to taste
MSG
2 c  Mushrooms, sliced
2 c  Rice, raw
Saffron (1/2 vial),
-shredded
1 lb Scallops
1 lb Shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 lb Crab meat
2 cn Clams (and juice)
1/2 c  Onion, chopped
1/4 c  Bell pepper, chopped
1/2 c  Margarine
Chicken stock (or bouillon)
-and water, to make 4 cups
1 tb Celery, chopped
Saute onion and bell pepper in margarine until translucent.  Add water
(and some chicken stock) and a hint of garlic.  Add celery, parsley,
salt and MSG.  (Water that comes out of seafood will make another 1/2
cup of liquid.)  Add mushrooms and clams; cover and bring to boil over
medium-high heat.

When water comes to rolling boil, put in rice and bring back to LOWEST
boil possible.  Add saffron; cover pot and don't touch it for 15
minutes. Rice should be cooked, but not split at ends yet --> a
little on the dry side.  Dump in all the seafood and stir thoroughly.
Bring back to a simmer; cover and cook 10 minutes.  Might need to
cook a little longer with the top off if the shrimp exude a lot of
liquid.  Check seasonings; can add more butter or pepper.

Mom's notes:

*  Might want to add oysters, too.  Don't drain the clams!

*  If you use canned mushrooms instead of fresh, add them when you
put in the seafood.
