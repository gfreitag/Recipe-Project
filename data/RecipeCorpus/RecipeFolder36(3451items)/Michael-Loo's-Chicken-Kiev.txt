Title: Michael Loo's Chicken Kiev
Categories: Poultry, Guestchefs
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Flour for dredging
Salt and pepper to taste
2    Eggs, beaten
1 c  Breadcrumbs for dredging
1    Stick butter, chilled
6    Boneless chicken breast
-halves
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Green onion, minced fine
Cut butter into 6 portions. Beat chicken pieces between wax paper
until they are thin cutlets. Do not make any holes.

Put one portion of butter in the middle of each cutlet. Sprinkle each
with green onion and salt and pepper. Roll each chicken piece into an
envelope shape, tucking in the sides.

Put a bunch of flour in a bowl; add salt and pepper to taste. Beat
two eggs in another bowl. Put about a cup of soft white breadcrumbs
(stale bread will also do) in a third bowl.

Take each chicken roll and dredge it in flour. Then dip it into the
egg and then roll it in breadcrumbs. You may repeat the egg-crumb
breading once if you like a thick crust. Put the finished rolls in
the fridge for at least an hour to firm up the breading.

Deep fry at 360 until brown on all sides. Serve with rice.
