Categories: Cake/cookie, Nuts/grains, Chocolate
Yield: 36 servings
-Sweetened Condensed Milk
(not evaporated milk)
1 ea (12-ounce) package
-semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/2 c  Creamy peanut butter
1/2 c  Margarine or butter
1 1/2 c  Graham cracker crumbs
1 ea (7-ounce) package flaked
-coconut (2 2/3 cups)
1 ea (14-ounce) can Eagle Brand
Preheat oven to 350 deg.F (325 deg.F for glass dish).
In 13x9-inch baking pan, melt margarine in oven.
Sprinkle crumbs evenly over margarine.
Top evenly with coconut then sweetened
condensed milk.  Bake 25 minutes or until lightly browned.
In small saucepan, over low heat, melt chips with peanut
butter.  Spread evenly over hot coconut layer.  Cool 30
minutes.  Chill thoroughly.  Cut into bars.  Store loosely
covered at room temperature.
Makes 36 bars.
My notes:  I heated the chocolate and peanut butter in the top of a
double boiler over hot water.  Worked great.  They say 36 bars...
this stuff is very rich (to my taste).  Also very
addictive, but very rich.  You could get away with cutting
it into 1" square bars and most people would be happy.
Chocoholics would have to consume more...   I have been
playing with putting chocolate stuff in the freezer in
order to mete it out over a long period, and so as to not
give myself so many calories at once.  These bars are not
great from the freezer, but it is still better than having
to eat the whole pan of them at once!  Anyway, these would
be great at one of your church things where you have to
bring something.
