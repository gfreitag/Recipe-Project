Title: Shiitake Japanese Style
Categories: Vegetables, Japanese
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 tb Mirin
2 1/2 tb Sugar
20    Shiitake caps
2/3 c  Sake
4 tb Dark soy sauce
Note: This is a very versatile way to prepare mushrooms. They go well
with grilled meats, either as an accompaniment or right on the skewer
with lamb or beef. They can be served chilled and sliced and added to
salads, or tossed warm into a salad with walnut oil and sage vinegar.
The marinade, once used, can be chilled and reused several times;
however, it will become more diluted each time by the liquid from the
mushrooms.

Clean the mushroom caps and remove the stems.

In a saucepan, combine the sake, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar and
bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and add the mushrooms. Simmer for
7 min. Remove the mushrooms and use in a salad immediately, or cool
and use later with grilled meats.
