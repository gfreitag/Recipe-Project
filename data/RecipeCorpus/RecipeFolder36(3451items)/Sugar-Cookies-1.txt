Recipe by: Jo Anne Merrill After cookies are baked, frost with a thin
powdered sugar frosting that has been tinted with food coloring.
Sprinkle with decorator sprinkles while frosting is still moist.
1-Cream butter and vanilla together. Add sugar slowly, creaming until
light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each.
2-In a separate bowl, stir dry ingredients together and slowly add to
creamed mixture. Chill for 3 hours or more. 3-Roll chilled dough out
on a well-floured surface to 1/4 inch thick. Cut into desired shapes.
Bake on an ungreased cookie sheet in preheated 375 degree oven for
6-8 minutes. Do not overbake. This makes about 6 dozen small cookies.
