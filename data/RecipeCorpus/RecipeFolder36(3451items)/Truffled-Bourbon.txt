Title: Truffled Bourbon
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 servings
1    Fifth good bourbon
1 oz Fresh truffles
Thinly sliced
Here's how to preserve truffles in bourbon. Cover the truffles
completely with the bourbon. It takes about 1 week for the truffle to
flavor the liquor; the bourbon takes on the truffle essence and keeps
it indefinitely, and you do not need to remove the truffle later. Use
the truffled bourbon in sauces or dishes that call for brandy;
remember to add some of the sliced truffle to the dish.
