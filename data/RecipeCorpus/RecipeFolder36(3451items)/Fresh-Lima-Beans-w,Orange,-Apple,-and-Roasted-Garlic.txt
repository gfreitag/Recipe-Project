Categories: Vegetables, Side dish, Appetizers
Yield: 6 servings
2 lg Oranges
Peeled and segmented
1 lg Granny Smith apple, peeled
Cored and finely grated
1 tb Basil leaves, shredded
2 c  Shelled lima beans
1 c  Orange juice
1 tb Brown sugar
1 ts Roasted Garlic Puree
(see pg 181)
Place the lima beans in a wide, shallow saute pan large enough to
hold the beans in a single layer. Add the orange juice, sugar, and
garlic puree and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until

Remove from the heat and place the beans in a mixing bowl with the

appetizer or side dish.
