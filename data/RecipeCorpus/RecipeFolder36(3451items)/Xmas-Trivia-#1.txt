MMMMM---------------------TRADITIONAL TURKEY--------------------------
What is more traditional than the turkey dinner at Christmas??  But
turkey dinner, though traditional now, was not known in Europe before
1542.  Even then it was served only as one of many festive dishes.
Ordinary families celebrated with goose or beef or Christmas pies of
many ingredients.  Of course, in the great houses and castlesthetable
was laden with the rarer delicacies.  In fact, the whole celebrations
had a ritual.  The celebrations started with the Lord of the
Manorinviting the people from the country side to a Christmas
celebration at his castle.  The great dining hall filled with guests
to partake of the Christmas feast.  The table was crowded with roast
peacock with tail spread and beak gilded, swan, venison, bustard,
goose, chicken, roast beef, mince pie, plum pudding, and every other
delicacy available.
