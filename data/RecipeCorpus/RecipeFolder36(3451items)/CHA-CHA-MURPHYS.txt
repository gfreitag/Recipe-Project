Salt & freshly ground pepper
1/2 c  Monterey Jack cheese OR
1/2 c  Sharp Cheddar cheese; grated
4    Baking potatoes (1-1/2 lb)

Pierce potatoes with a fork and wrap individually in a double
thickness of paper towels.  Microwave on high for 5 minutes.  Rotate
the potatoes and microwave on high until tender, about 5 minutes
more.  Unwrap the potatoes and let cool slightly.
Cut off a 1/4-inch thick slice along the top of each potato.  With a
melon baller or teaspoon, carefully hollow out the potatoes, leaving
the shells. Put the insides in a medium-sized bowl, and mash with a
fork or potato masher.  Add sour cream, buttermilk, cilantro and
salsa; mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.  Fill the shells with
the potato mixture.  Arrange the potatoes in a microwave-safe pie
plate or baking dish.  Cover with vented plastic wrap.  Microwave on
high for 5 minutes, or until heated through.  Sprinkle the potatoes
with cheese and serve.
