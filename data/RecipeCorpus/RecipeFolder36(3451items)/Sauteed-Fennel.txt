Wash the fennel well and remove any discolored outer leaves. With a
sharp knife, split each bulb into 4 pieces lengthwise. Remove as much
of the tough roots as possible without losing any leaves.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the
fennel, flat side down, in the oil and saute for about 2 min. Add the
stock, thyme, and a pinch of salt, and bring to a boil. Reduce the
heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for about 20 min. The fennel should
remain firm. Remove the pan from the heat, season with pepper, and
serve the fennel with its cooking liquid.
