Literally Ochsenmaulsalat means ox-mouth salad. To be authentic you
must use the meat picked from the cheeks and mouth of a cooked corned
beef head.

Place tongue in pot and cover with cold water. Add vinegar, bring to a
boil, reduce heat and simmer slowly for 3 hrs. Cool tongue, peel it,
slice thinly and cut slices into slivers. Mix onion, salt, pepper,
vinegar and oil together and pour over tongue slivers. Adjust the
seasonings. Chill until served and pour off the excess marinade
before bringing to the table.
