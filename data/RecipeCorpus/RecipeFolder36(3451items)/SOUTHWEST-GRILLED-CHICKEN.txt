sections.
In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, mustard, salt,
sugar, black pepper, taragon, and red pepper flakes.  Add the chicken
and turn it to coat with the marinade.
Let the chicken marinate, covered and chilled, overnight.  Drain it
and discard the marinade.  Grill the chicken on an oiled rack set 5
to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning it, for 15 to 20 minutes, or
until it is cooked through.
NOTE: interstingly enough, the restaurant also makes the marinade in
this dish for use as a salad dressing.
