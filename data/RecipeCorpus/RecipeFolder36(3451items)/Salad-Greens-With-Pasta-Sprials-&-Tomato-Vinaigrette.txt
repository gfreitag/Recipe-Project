To make pasta spirals:  Fill a wide shallow pan half full of salted
water.  Bring to a boil and cook noodles until tender.  Drain, rinse
under cold water and pat dry.  Meanwhile, rinse spinach leaves and
while still damp, place in a microwave-safe pie plate.  Microwave
covered on HIGH (100%)
for 1 to 2 minutes or until wilted.  Blot very dry.  Cut out stems.

Arrange a layer of spinach over each noodle.  Slice salmon diagonally
into 1-inch wide strips.  Place diagonally across noodles at 1/2-inchh
intervals.  The strips should touch the short end of the noodles.
Spread with a heaping tablespoon of cheese, spreading to the edges.
(If cheese is difficult to spread, warm it in the microwave until
soft and stir in 1/2 to 1 teaspoon milk).  Roll up tightly into a
spiral.  Place on a plate seam side down and spray tops with no-stick
spray to prevent drying out. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
for at least one hour. (The spirals may be refrigerated up to 2 days).

To prepare salad: Prepare lettuce, spinach, endive and radicchio, wrap
in paper towls, place in a plastic bag and refrigerate (Greens may
be refrigerated overnight.)

To make vinaigrette: In a large skillet over high heat, heat olive
oil. Add green onions, garlic and toomatoes and cook, stirring, just
until the tomatoes begin to soften, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from heat
and stir in vinegar, salt, pepper and basil.  (The dressing may be
refrigerated overnight.)

To assemble salad:  About 10 to 30 minutes before serving, slice pasta
into sprials 3/8 to 1/2-inch thick and let sit at room temperature.
Reheat dressing in the microwave or on top of stove until warm.
Divide greens among salad plates, spoon warm dressing over and top
each with 2 to 3 slices pasta.
