Title: Tamarind Water
Categories: Caribbean
Yield: 1 cup
1 1/2 c  Boiling water
1/2 lb Tamarind pods
(8-10 pods)
Peel the skin off the tamarind pods with a paring knife. Break the
pulp into 1-inch pieces and place in the bowl of a blender with 1 cup
boiling water. Let the tamarind soften for 5 min.

Run the blender in short bursts at low speed for 15-20 seconds to get
a thick brown liquid. Do not overblend, or you'll break up the seeds.
Pour the resulting liquid through a strainer, pressing hard with a
wooden spoon to extract the juices, scraping the bottom of the
strainer with a spatula.

Return the pulp in the strainer to the blender and add  1/2 cup
boiling water. Blend again and pour the mixture through the strainer,
pressing well to extract the juices.

Tamarind water (or puree) will keep for up to 5 days in the
refrigerator and can be frozen for several months.

To make Tamarind Nectar, combine 1 cup tamarind water with 4 cups cold
water, and add sugar to taste.
