MEAT SAUCE Melt butter, saute onion, meat & garlic, stirring until
brown. Add herbs & spices and tomato sauce; bring to a boil. Reduce
heat, simmer, uncovered, about 30 min. Just before assembling
casserole, mix bread crumbs into sauce. EGGPLANT - Halve eggplants
lengthwise. Cut each half across into 1/2" slices.  Place slices in
bottom of broiler pan. Sprinkle with salt & pepper and brush with
butter. Broil 4 inches from heat four minute on each side. CREAM
SAUCE -Melt butter & stir in flour, salt & pepper. Add millk
gradually. Bring to a boil, stirring until thick. Remove from heat.
Beat a small amount of cream mixture into eggs. Blend egg mixture
into remaining sauce.  Mix well and set aside. TO ASSEMBLE - In a 2
qt. shallow baking dish, layer half of the eggplant, overlapping
slightly. Sprinkle w/2 tb of the combined cheeses. Pour meat sauce of
eggplant. Sprinkle w/2 more tb of cheese.  Layer remaining eggplant
over top. Pour cream sauce over all.  Sprinkle w/remaining cheeses.
Bake @350 until brown and top is set, approx. 35-40 min. This sounds
more complicated than it is, and makes a great party dish, as it is
very "forgiving" - eggplant haters won't even know what they're
eating!
