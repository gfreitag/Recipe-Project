Categories: Poultry, Game
Yield: 4 servings
Water
1 md Onion; chopped
2    Carrots; chopped
1    Apple; peeled and chopped
1 cn Con Cream of mushroom soup
(10-1/2 ounces)
1/4 c  Light cream
1/4 c  Red wine
2    Grouse, about 1-1/2 lbs each
Salt
1/2 c  Chopped onion
1/2 c  Chopped mushrooms
1 c  Condensed consomme'
(10-1/2 ounces)
1/8 ts Crumbled oregano
1 c  Wild rice
Rub grouse inside and out with salt.  Combine onions, mushrooms,
consomme', oregano, and wild rice.  Bring to a boil and simmer until
rice is tender, about 40 to 45 minutes, adding water when necessary
to keep rice from sticking.  When rice is tender, season to taste
with salt. Stuff grouse with rice.  Place onion, carrots, and apple
in a shallow roasting pan and place grouse on top, breast side down.
Roast in a preheated 350 F. oven for 30 minutes.  Turn grouse breast
side up and roast until brown and tender, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
Remove grouse to a platter and keep warm.  Strain pan juices into a
saucepan.  Stir in soup, cream, and wine.  Simmer, stirring, until
sauce bubbles.  Spoon sauce over grouse.  Garnish with additional
cooked wild rice.
