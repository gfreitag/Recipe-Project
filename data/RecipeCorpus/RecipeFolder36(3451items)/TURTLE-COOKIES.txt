MMMMM---------------------CHOCOLATE FROSTING--------------------------
1 tb Butter or margarine
1 c  Sifted powdered sugar
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate

Resift flour with soda and salt. Cream 1/2 cup butter and brown sugar
together thoroughly. Add 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk and beat well.
Stir in vanilla. Add dry ingredients and mix well. Arrange pecan
halves in groups of 3 or 5 on greased baking sheets to resemble head
and legs of turtle. Roll rounded teaspoons of dough into balls. Dip
bottom of each into remaining unbeaten egg white and press lightly
onto nuts so tips of nuts show. Bake at 350F 10 to 13 minutes. Cool.

Meanwhile, to make frosting, combine chocolate, milk and 1 tablespoon
butter in top of double boiler. Cook over simmering water, stirring
until smooth. Remove from heat and beat in powdered sugar until
smooth and glossy, adding more sugar if needed. Frost top of cookies.
