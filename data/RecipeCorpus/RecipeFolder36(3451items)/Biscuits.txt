Title: Biscuits
Categories: Breads, Kooknet
Yield: 16 biscuits
1/4 c  Cold Butter; cut in 4-5
-pieces
3/4 c  Cold Milk
2 c  -minus
1 tb All-Purpose Flour
1/2 ts Salt
2 1/2 ts Baking Powder
Heat the oven to 450Ã¸F. Combine the dry ingredients in a large shallow
bowl, stirring with a wire whisk to be sure they are thoroughly
combined. Using your fingertips or a pastry blender, work in the
butter until the mixture is the texture of coarse cornmeal.

Make a well in the center and pour the milk in all at once. Stir the
dough together as quickly as possible, using only 8-10 strokes, then
turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 5-6 times, just
until barely smooth. It should be soft but not sticky.

Gently roll or pat dough out 1/2" thick. Cut circles with a biscuit
cutter or use a sharp knife to cut the dough into squares. Set them
on an ungreased baking sheet, well separated for crisp biscuits,
close together for soft-sided ones, and bake for 12-15 minutes, or
until well-risen and brown. Serve hot from the oven.
