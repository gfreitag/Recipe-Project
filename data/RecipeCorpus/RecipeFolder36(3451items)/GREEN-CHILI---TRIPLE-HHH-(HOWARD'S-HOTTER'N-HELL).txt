Title: GREEN CHILI - TRIPLE HHH (HOWARD'S HOTTER'N HELL)
Categories: Main dish, Chili
Yield: 10 servings
2 ts Ground red chili
1 tb Red chili flakes
1    Tomato
1 cn Tomatillos
4 lb Green chilis
4 c  Wyler's chicken boullion
3 tb Cornstarch
1 tb Oil
2 lb Chicken breasts boneless -
-or Pork Shoulder Roast
2    Onions
2 ts Minced garlic
1 ts Oregano
1 ts Cumin powder
chilis, tomato and tomatillos.  Add oil to heavy, preferably cast
iron, skillet and brown chicken over high heat.  It is best to do it
in two or three small batches.  Remove to large saucepan.  Add onions
and garlic to leftover oil and brown until onions are soft.  Add
oregano, cumin, and red chili, and cook for two or three minutes.
Transfer from skillet to saucepan with chicken.  Add tomato,
tomatillos, chilis, and chicken broth.  Bring to a boil and simmer
for 3 - 4 hours.  Add water as necessary to maintain the desired
consistency.  Add 3 - 4 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with water prior
to serving to thicken as desired.

Eat from a bowl accompanied with a warm flour tortilla or use it as a
sauce over chili rellenos, eggs, enchiladas, or just about anything.
One of my favorite meals is to grill a steak until nice and juicy,
smother with green chili, sprinkle some grated cheese on top and serve
with Mexican rice.
