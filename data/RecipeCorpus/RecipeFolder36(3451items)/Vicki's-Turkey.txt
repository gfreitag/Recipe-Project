Title: Vicki's Turkey
Categories: Poultry, Holiday
Yield: 1 turkey
Kahlua
Apricot preserves
Turkey
Butter, melted
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Rub cleaned turkey with unsalted shortening or butter.  Cover the
bird with a piece of cheesecloth soaked in melted, unsalted butter.
Reduce the heat to 350 and place turkey in oven.

Make glaze of equal parts Kahlua and apricot preserves.  Sounds
weird, but it is delicious.  Baste turkey with glaze right over the
top of the cheesecloth.  (The taste actually permeates the meat.)

Peel the cloth off before presentation (bird is a dark, rich brown)
and serve w/ sauce.

Vicki's notes:

*  The basic technique is from "Joy of Cooking," although Rombauer
says to put it on a rack.  The glaze is from the Kahlua company.

*  The only time I used pop-up indicators is when I was given turkeys
that had them.  I ignored the indicator --> used standard cooking
chart for weight (should be on turkey).  You know how the turkey
keeps cooking even when it's not in the oven?  Sure enough, after he
had been out of oven long enough to serve, the indicator FINALLY
popped up!
