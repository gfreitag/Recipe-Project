Title: Muffuletta Bread
Categories: Cajun/creol, Breads
Yield: 1 servings
3 c  Bread flour
1 1/2 tb Vegetable shortening
Sesame seeds
1 c  Warm water (110F, 45C)
1 tb Sugar
1    Pk 1/4 oz active dry yeast
In a 2-cup glass measuring cup, combine water and sugar.  Stir in
yeast. Let stand until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes.  In a food processor
fitted with the steel blade, combine 3 cups flour, salt and
shortening.  Add yeast mixture.  Process until dough forms a ball,
about 5 seconds. Stop machine; check consistency of dough.  It should
be smooth and satiny.  If dough is too dry, add more warm water, 1
tablespoon at a time, processing just until blended.  If dough is too
sticky, add more flour, 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time, processing just
until blended.  Process 20 seconds to knead.  Lightly oil a large
bowl, swirling to coat bottom and sides. Place dough in oiled bowl;
turn to coat all sides.  Cover bowl with a plastic wrap.  Let rise in
a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about 1-1/2 hours.
Lightly grease a baking sheet.  When dough has doubled in bulk punch
down dough; turn out onto a lightly floured surface.  Form dough into
a round loaf about 10 inches in diameter; place on a greased baking
sheet.  Sprinkle top of loaf with sesame seeds; press seeds gently
into surface of loaf.  Cover very loosely with plastic wrap; let rise
until almost doubled in bulk, 1 hour. Place rack in center of oven.
Preheat oven to 425F (220C). Remove plastic wrap.  Bake loaf in center
of preheated oven 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 375F (190C); bake 25
minutes. The loaf is done when it sounds hollow when tapped on bottom.
Cool completely on a rack before slicing. Makes 1 loaf.
