Title: Shrimp Toast 2
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Asian, Wok
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Corn starch
1    Egg
8 sl Bread (crusts removed)
Oil for deep frying
2    Water chestnuts
1/2 lb Shrimp, cleaned & deveined
Salt
Pepper
1/2 sm Onion
1. Dice onion, water chestnuts, and shrimp together. Mince until fine.
Place in small bowl. Add egg, salt, pepper, and corn starch. Mix
thoroughly. Spread in a thin layer on slices of bread.

2. Pour oil into a wok, halfway up. Turn heat on to highest point.
When you think oil is sufficiently heated, take a bread crust and
test it to see if it is up to the proper temperature. If bread crust
readily browns to a golden colour then oil is ready. If bread crust
fails to brown, then oil is not ready yet. If bread crust turns to a
dark brown, then shut heat off and allow oil to cool at least 5
minutes before turning burner back on. Be sure and retest oil before
deep frying shrimp toast.

3. Place a slice of bread with the shrimp mixture face down in the
hot oil and deep fry about 3 minutes until golden brown colour. Turn
bread and fry reverse side. Remove to paper toweling to drain excess
oil. Repeat procedure until all slices are done.

4. Cut slices of shrimp toast into strips or triangles. Serve
immediately.

NOTE: Very nice to serve for after theatre snack. Shrimp can be
minced and mixed ahead of time. Deep frying can be done at last
minute.
