Karen Mintzias
500 g  Finely ground fatty pork
500 g  Finely ground veal or lamb
1 lg Onion; finely chopped
Combine pork with veal or lamb, onion, parsley, salt and a generous
grinding of black pepper.
Dip panna into a bowl of warm water for a minute or two, remove and
carefully open out a piece at a time, laying it out flat on work
surface. Cut with kitchen scissors into pieces about 10 cm (4 inches)
square. Take a good tablespoon of meat mixture and shape into a thick
sausage about 5 cm (2 inches) long.  Place towards one edge of piece
of panna, fold end and sides over meat and roll up firmly.  Repeat
with remaining ingredients. Thread sausages on flat sword-like
skewers, leaving space between them. Number on each skewer depends on
their length. Cook over glowing charcoal, turning frequently.  Do not
place too close to heat as sheftalia must cook fairly slowly so that
the inside is well cooked and the outside nicely browned without
being burnt.  The panna melts during cooking, keeping the meat moist
and adding flavour. Excessive flaring of fire can be controlled by a
sprinkle of water on the coals. Serve sheftalia as an appetizer or a
main course.
