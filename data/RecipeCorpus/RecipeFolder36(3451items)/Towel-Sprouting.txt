Title: Towel Sprouting
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------METHOD AND INSTRUCTIONS-----------------------
Towel sprouting works best for larger grains and seeds.

1. Soak the seeds in a jar in 3 times as much water as you have seeds
for time given in recipe, then rinse and arrange on a damp towel.

2. Cover with another damp towel, and wrap in plastic wrap or place
inside a plastic bag.

3. Set the towels aside, in a warm (70 degree F), dark place.

4. Dampen the towels daily by misting them with water.

5. If the seeds haven't sprouted after 2 days, change the towels to
prevent spoilage.

6. On about the fourth day, remove the top towel and move the sprouts
into the sunlight so that chlorophyll can develop and turn the leaves
green. Mist as needed.

7. Move the sprouts from the towel to a strainer, and rinse well to
remove the hulls, if desired. Hulls can shorten the storage life of
sprouts, but they also add flavor.

8. Use sprouts immediately in salads, sandwiches, or as the recipe
suggests. To store, put in plastic bags and refrigerate.

9. Wash and dry all equipment and put away for next use.
