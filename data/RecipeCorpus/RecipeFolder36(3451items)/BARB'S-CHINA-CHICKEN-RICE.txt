4    Mushrooms; fresh, diced fine
2    Zucchini; cut into cubes
1 tb Cilantro; fresh, chopped

1 c  Rice; cooked
3/4 c  Chicken broth; or as needed
1/4 c  Slivered almonds
Soy sauce; to taste
1    Chicken breast; boned,
- skinned cut in bite-size
-pieces
1 sl Ginger; fresh, diced

1    Garlic clove; pressed
2 tb Soy sauce
1 1/2 ts Sesame oil
2 tb Canola oil
Place chicken pieces in a bowl with the garlic, ginger, sesame oil,
and 2 tablespoons soy sauce. stir to coat and let stand while
preparing the remaining vegetables.
Put the canola oil into a medium sized skillet (or wok). Saute the
onions until they are limp.  Add the mushrooms and saute until they
give up their juice. Remove the vegetables and reserve.
Put the chicken and it's spices in the skillet, being careful to
drain most of the liquid and cook until it it cooked through and
slightly browned. Add the zucchini and cilantro, and stir fry 3
minutes. Add the rice, the reserved vegetables and enough of the
chicken stock to keep the rice from sticking.
Cook only briefly to allow everything to heat through. Add the
almonds and serve immediately.
Note:  This is a dish I often make when I have leftover rice, and I
very often use up different cooked vegetables in this dish. With
cooked vegetables, simply cut them into small cubes, or julienne and
add them just early enough so that they will be well heated. Try not
to use vegetables that will become mushy with the heating, you will
want them to still be tender-crisp. We often use carrots, broccoli,
even spinach. If you are having Denise Bradshaw over to dinner, throw
in a few peas.
