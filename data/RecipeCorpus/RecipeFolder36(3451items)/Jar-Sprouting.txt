Title: Jar Sprouting
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM----------------------METHOD AND STEPS---------------------------
Jar sprouting works best for small seeds, such as alfalfa, clover or
radish.

1. Rinse the seeds in lukewarm water.

2. Put the seeds in a jar, then add 3 times as much water as you have
seeds. Cover with a plastic mesh lid, cheesecloth, or nylon net, then
fasten with a rubber band or canning jar screw band. You won't need to
remove the mesh covering until the sprouts are ready to harvest. Set
aside and soak for the time given in the recipe.

3. At the end of the soaking time, drain off the water through the
mesh covering.

4. Rinse the seeds with lukewarm water and drain.

5. Set the jar in a warm (60 degree F), dark place, at an angle so the
sprouts can drain.

6. Rinse and drain the sprouts twice a day, or as the recipe directs.
In hot, dry weather, rinse them 3 to 4 times a day. Turn the jar
gently as you rinse and drain so that the sprouts won't break off. If
the weather or your kitchen is very humid, move the sprouts to a dry
place, such as near the stove or wrapped in a towel to keep out the
light, near a sunny window. Too much humidity will prevent sprouting.
Temperatures above 80 degrees F can also prevent sprouting.

7. On about the fourth day, move the jar of sprouts into the sunlight
so that chlorophyll can develop and turn the leaves green. Continue
to rinse and drain.

8. Move the sprouts from the jar to a strainer, and rinse well to
remove the hulls if desired. Hulls can shorten the life of sprouts,
but they also add flavor.

9. Use sprouts immediately in salads, sandwiches, or as the recipe
suggests. To store, put in plastic bags and refrigerate.

10. Wash and dry all equipment and put away for next use.
