Title: Spudnuts
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 dozen
2    Eggs, beaten
1/2 ts Vanilla
6 1/2    To 7 cups all-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
2 ts Salt
1 3/4 c  Milk
1/2 c  Shortening
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Mashed potatoes
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/2 c  Warm water, 110-115 degrees
Scald milk; stir in shortening, sugar and mashed
potatoes. Cool to lukewarm. Blend well.

Sprinkle yeast over warm water and stir until yeast is
dissolved. Add to milk mixture.  Stir in beaten eggs
and vanilla.

Sift 6 1/2 c. flour with baking powder and salt; add
gradually to yeast mixture, mixing well after each
addition. Add another 1/2 c. flour if needed to make a
soft dough you can handle (use no more than
necessary). Turn into greased bowl; turn dough over to
grease top. Cover and let rise in warm place until
doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.

Roll to 1/2 " thickness on floured board. Cut with
floured doughnut cutter, reserving centers to make
Pecan Rolls (recipe follows).

Place cut-out doughnuts on waxed paper; cover with
cloth and let rise in warm place until doubled, about
30 minutes.

Fry a few doughnuts at a time in hot salad oil (375
degrees). Drain on absorbent paper. Spread warm
doughnuts with a thin glaze made of confectioners
sugar and milk, or shake them in a bag containing
sugar to coat them. Makes about 4 dozen doughnuts.
