Title: Mushrooms with Basil in Potato Sauce
Categories: Vegetables, Potatoes
Yield: 4 servings
Firmly packed
1 tb White wine vinegar
1/4 c  Heavy cream
1/4 c  Milk
Salt
2 tb Olive oil
6 sm New potatoes, peeled or
3    Russet potatoes
Peeled and halved
1 lb Mushrooms
(2" or larger caps)
3/4 c  Basil leaves
Bring about 3 qts of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the potatoes,
cover, and cook until the potatoes are soft when pierced with a fork,
about 30 min.

While the potatoes are cooking, clean the mushrooms and set aside.
Place the basil,  1/4 cup water, and the vinegar in a blender and
process until well pureed. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

Drain the potatoes, place in a food processor, and process until well
pureed, stopping occasionally to wipe down the sides with a rubber
spatula. Place the potatoes in a blender and add the cream and milk,
in 2 batches if necessary.  Blend until the mixture is smooth, adding
a little more milk, if necessary, until the mixture has the
consistency of a thickened sauce rather than mashed potatoes. Pour
this mixture through a medium-fine sieve to eliminate any lumps.
Place the sauce in a small saucepan and reheat, stirring. Add salt to
taste and keep warm.

Place the basil puree and the olive oil in a saute pan and begin to
warm over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and saute for 5 min adding a
little salt to taste. evenly divide the warmed potato sauce among 4
plates, covering the plates from rim to rim. Arrange the herb-sauteed
mushrooms in the middle of the sauce and serve immediately.

Note: This sauce can be made ahead of time and reheated in the
microwave, but you may have to add some milk because the potatoes
will absorb some of the moisture while sitting. Also you may have to
add more cream and milk to obtain the right consistency, since some
potatoes have less moisture than others.
