%%%%%  THE BOTANICALLY CORRECT VERSION  %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
If you've ever taken a botany course, you know that every part of a
plant, whether fruit or vegetables, has a name.  There's a science to
it all, the sort of thing Mr. Hoyle would appreciate.  So, let's look
at some definitions.  "Botanically and strictly, fruit is the ripened
ovary of a flower, including its contents and any closely adhering
parts. Examples are cucumber, pepper, tomato, apple, plum,
raspberry." Or even more to the point, fruit is "the seedbearing
product of a plant." According to the Botanists, the parts of
squasyh, eggplants, watermelon, cucumber, and pepper that we ear are
actually very large berries, so we are correctl to call them fruit.
With this light to guide us, we can safely determine that avocado,
string bean, grape, peach and pear, are also, of course, fruit.  Corn
and peas also have seeds, so we may as well include them.  Maybe we
ought to rename that plot out back the fruit garden!
Wait you wail.... You've never called a cucumber or a string bean or a
squash a fruit in your life, and you'r not about to start now.  You
don't like that version of the game.
