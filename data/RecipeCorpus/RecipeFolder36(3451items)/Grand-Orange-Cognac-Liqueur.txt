Title: Grand Orange-Cognac Liqueur
Categories: Beverages, Alcohol
Yield: 1 pint
2 c  Cognac or French brandy
1/2 ts Glycerin
1/3 c  Orange zest*
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
Grand Marnier is a classic orange liqueur to be
savored. While ordinary brandy can be used, we
recommend a good cognac or French brandy for best
flavor. Ready in 5 to 6 months. Makes about 1 pint.

Place zest and sugar in a small bowl. Mash and mix
together with the back of a wooden spoon or a pestle.
Continue mashing until sugar is absorbed into the
orange zest and is no longer distinct. Place into
aging container. Add cognac. Stir, cap and let age in
a cool dark place 2 to 3 months, shaking monthly.

After initial aging, pour through fine mesh strainer
placed over medium bowl. Rinse out aging container.
Pour glycerin into aging container and place cloth bag
inside strainer. Pour liqueur through cloth bag. Stir
with a wooden spoon to combine. Cap and age 3 more
months before serving.

*Note: Authentic Grand Marnier uses bitter Haitian
oranges to produce its classic taste. You may use any
type of orange peel you wish; however, a bitter type,
such as Seville, is preferred for authenticity.
