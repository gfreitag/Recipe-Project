Categories: Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Basil, chopped or
1 ts Dried basil
1 ts Dried sage
1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 lb Wild mushrooms
1/4 oz Dried porcini
2 tb Butter
1 tb Tomato paste
1 c  Heavy cream
1/4 c  Dry white wine
Place the fresh mushrooms in a large saucepan and add  1/2 cup water.
Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat, cover tightly, and let
mushrooms "sweat" for 20 min.

Pour the liquid from the mushrooms into a small saucepan, leaving the
fresh mushrooms in the large pan. Set the mushrooms aside.

Add the dried porcini to the small saucepan and bring to a boil over
high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer the porcini for 20 min or
until very soft. Place the porcini and  1/2 cup of the liquid in a
blender. If there's not enough cooking liquid, add a little water.
Puree until smooth.

Return the mushroom puree to the saucepan and add the butter, tomato
paste, cream, wine, basil, sage, sugar, and salt. Simmer over medium
heat until slightly thickened, about 5 min. Strain the sauce, then
add to the sweated fresh mushrooms. Reheat and serve on its own or
use as a sauce for chicken, pork, veal, or game birds.
