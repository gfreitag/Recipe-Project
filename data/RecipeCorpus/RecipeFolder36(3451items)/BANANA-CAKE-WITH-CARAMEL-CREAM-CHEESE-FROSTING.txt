1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 13- by 9-inch baking pan. Sift
together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.
2. Beat butter and granulated sugar in large bowl of electric mixer
on high speed until light, 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing
well after each addition. Stop the mixer and add bananas, sour cream
and vanilla. Mix in on low speed. Fold in the dry ingredients and
nuts with a rubber spatula.
3. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted
in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool completely on
wire rack.
4. For caramel glaze, combine brown sugar and condensed milk in a
small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until mixture
begins to bubble. Reduce heat to low and add butter; cook and stir
until melted. Remove from the heat and stir in confectioners' sugar
and vanilla. Spread over cooled cake.
5. For frosting, beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Stir in
sour cream, maple and vanilla. Add enough confectioners' sugar to
make a smooth, thick frosting. Carefully spread over caramel glaze.
