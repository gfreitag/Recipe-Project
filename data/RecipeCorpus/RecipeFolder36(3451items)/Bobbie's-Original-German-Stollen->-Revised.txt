Title: Bobbie's Original German Stollen > Revised
Categories: Aust/german, Holiday, Breads
Yield: 2 loaves
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Butter
3    Eggs
1/2 ts Salt
1    Lemon rind; grated
2 tb Dark rum
Butter; melted
7 c  All-purpose flour; divided
2 pk Yeast
1/2 c  Water; warm
1 c  Milk; warm
1/2 lb Raisins
1/2 lb Almonds; chopped
1 1/2 c  Candied fruits; chopped
Add the yeast into the milk and water and let stand until foaming,
about 10 min. Add and mix in 1 cup of flour. Let this sponge rise
in a warm place until doubled in size. Sprinkle the fruit with a
little flour. Beat the butter until softened and gradually add the
sugar. Mix until smooth and creamy. Beat in the eggs one at a
time. Add the salt, rind, rum, nuts and floured fruit. Add the
sponge and 3 cups of the flour. Mix and add the last of the flour.
Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Let rise until doubled
in size.

Punch down, divide into two and place in pans. Brush with melted
butter and let loaves rise again. Preheat oven to 350 and bake
for 45 min.

[Bobbie: This is how it came out. Your recipe has three times
as much fruit in it and a bit less sugar, otherwise it's close to
my stollen recipe which is kinda based on the Joy of Cooking one.
I am assuming that "mixed fruits" means candied fruits like you
buy for fruit cakes but it _might_ mean an assortment of dried and
chopped apricots, dates, currants etc. My recipe also calls for a
glaze: Let cool and spread on a glaze of 1 1/4 c icing sugar, 1/4

c lemon juice and 1 tsp vanilla mixed.
