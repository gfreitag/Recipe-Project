Title: Where's the Heat in Chilies

One of the most often repeated culinary misconceptions is that the
seeds in chile pepper are either the principal or a significant
source of heat.

According to Dave DeWitt, author of The Whole Chile Pepper Book, "The
heat source of chile peppers, capsaicin, is produced by glands at the
junction of the placenta and the pod wall. The capsaicin spreads
unevenly throughout the inside of the pod and is concentrated mostly
in the placental tissue. The seeds are not sources of heat, as
commonly believed. However, because of their proximity to the
placenta, the seeds do occasionally absorb capsaicin through the
processing procedure. For every hundred parts of capsaicin in the
placental tissue, there are six parts in the rest of the fruit
tissue, and four parts in the seeds."

The scientific conclusion that the seeds contain the least amount of
piquancy can be informally confirmed by carefully removing some seeds,
rinsing them, and then chewing them. There are certainly good reasons
to remove the seeds from chiles, including their unpleasant texture
and sometimes bitter taste, but controlling the heat doesn't seem to
be one of them.
