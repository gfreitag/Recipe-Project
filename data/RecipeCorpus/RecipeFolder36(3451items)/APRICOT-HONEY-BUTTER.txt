Title: APRICOT-HONEY BUTTER
Categories: Fruit
Yield: 2 cups
1/2 c  Honey
3 tb Finely chopped crystallized
Ginger
3 c  Dried apricots (2 lbs)
2 tb Grated lemon zest
1/2 c  Fresh lemon juice
In a heavy saucepan, combine apricots, lemon zest, 1/4 cup lemon
juice and 2 cups water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and
simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the apricots
are soft. Transfer the apricots and the cooking liquid to a food

honey and the remaining 1/4 cup lemon juice. Simmer, stirring often,
until very thick, about 1 hour. Stir in crystallized ginger and let
cool. (The butter can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up
to 2 weeks or in the freezer for up to 6 months.) Source: Eating Well
