Title: Asian-Style Sauteed Greens
Categories: Asian, Vegetables, Chinese, Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
-chopped
1 tb Finely grated ginger
1 ts Soy sauce
2 ts Rice wine vinegar
1/2 ts Cornflour
500 g  Baby bok choy
25 g  Shiitake mushrooms
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 ts Sesame oil
1/2 ts Salt
4    Garlic cloves, finely
This dish looks so attractive with the vivid green of the bok choy
and dark earthy brown shades of the mushrooms.  It is also delicious,
light yet filling.  Look for bok choy and shiitake mushrooms at
oriental food stores or good greengrocers.  Many have the fresh
shiitake mushrooms.

Cut the bases off the bok choy, separating the leaves but keeping
plenty of stalk on each leaf.  Wash and dry the leaves and cut each
across into 2 or 3 pieces.  Trim stalks and cut the mushrooms in 1cm
slices.

Heat the oils and stir-fry the mushrooms in a wok or large pan over a
medium heat and add the salt.  Cook the mushrooms until they give up
some juice and reabsorb it.  Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry
for 1 min.

Add the bok choy and continue to stir-fry until wilted.  Have ready
the soy sauce, vinegar, and cornflour combined in a small bowl.  Add
this mixture to the greens and cook for about 1 min or until the
greens are glazed.
