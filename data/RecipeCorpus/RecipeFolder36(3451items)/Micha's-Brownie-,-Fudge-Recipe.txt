Categories: Cake/cookie, Candies
Yield: 8 servings
1 1/2 c  Flour
1 ds Cognac or Vanilla
100 g  Broken Nuts
200 g  Margarine
100 g  Bitter Chocolate

Melt the margarine carefully then melt and stir the chocolate into
it. Mix the other ingredients together, adding the eggs one at a
time. Add half the broken nuts in the mixture. Pour the mixture into
a glass baking tray. Bake in medium heat 25 - 30 minutes. It's done
when you stick a toothpick in and it comes out dry. Don't overbake
Cut into squares while still hot but leave in tray. My notes: Medium
