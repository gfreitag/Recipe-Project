The Rice:

Preheat the oven to 375 F.

In a large, heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the
onion, garlic, bay leaf, clove, and cardamon, and saute for 3 min, or
until the onion is soft. Add the rice and saute for 2 min, stirring
constantly. Add the turmeric, stirring well, then the chicken stock,
salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat. Cover
the pan and cook in the oven for 15-17 minutes, until the liquid is
absorbed.

Remove the rice from the oven and fluff with a fork. Fold in the
lobster and cilantro, then divided among 4 serving plates, garnishing
each with two Oven-Dried Tomatoes. Pass the Yogurt-Mint Sauce at the
table.

Oven-Dried Tomatoes:

Preheat the oven to its lowest temperature, about 200 F.

Slice the tomatoes lengthwise into quarter and lay on a baking sheet
lined with parchment paper, seed-side up. Mix the sugar and salt
together in a small bowl and sprinkle evenly over the tomatoes.

Place the baking sheet in the oven and let the tomatoes dry for at
least 12 and up to 24 hours.

Remove the tomatoes from the oven and cool. Store in an airtight
container until ready to use. Keeps for up to 2-3 weeks. For longer
storage, submerge the tomatoes in olive oil, cover, and refrigerate.

Yogurt-Mint Sauce:

Mix the mint leaves and sugar together in a small bowl, then stir
into the yogurt. Serve.
