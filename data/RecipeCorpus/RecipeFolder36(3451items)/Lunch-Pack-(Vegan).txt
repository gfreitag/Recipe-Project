Title: Lunch Pack (Vegan)
Categories: Snacks, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-----------------PUT INTO PLASTIC CONTAINER----------------------
1    Can sliced water chestnuts
1    Salad tomato, chopped
1 c  To 2c cooked rice, half
-of it wild, half basmati
MMMMM----------------------------ADD---------------------------------
-almost to rim
Sliced fresh mushrooms as
-necessary to fill container
MMMMM------------------DUMP ON TOP--DO NOT MIX-----------------------
Oregano to taste
1/2    Can Hunts tomato sauce
Black pepper to taste
At work, when hunger hits, nuke for 3-5 mins, depending on the
microwave you are using.

Author's note:  I like stuff cooked right, so I use 5 mins to get the
tomatoes nice and done.  Do not mix when adding last ingredients.  If
you mix it, the rice will be to soggy come lunchtime.  Mix just
before nuking.
