Title: YAKIMONDU
Categories: Appetizers, Asian
Yield: 40 servings
2 ts Sesame seeds; toasted
- slightly crushed
2 ts Sesame oil
1/4 ts Ground pepper
40    Wonton wrappers
1/2 lb Nappa cabbage
3/4 ts Salt
8 oz Minced or ground beef chuck
3/4 c  Chopped scallion
1    Garlic clove; minced
1 tb Soy sauce
Sprinkle the cabbage leaves with 1/2 tsp salt and let stand about 15
minutes until they wilt.  Squeeze out any moisture, then rinse and
dry the leaves.  Chop the cabbage.  In a bowl combine the cabbage,
beef, scallions, garlic, soy sauce, sesame seeds, sesame oil, pepper
and 1/4 tsp salt and mix thoroughly.  To make each dumpling, place 1
1/2 teaspoonful filling in the center of a wrapper using two spoons.
Fold the wonton wrapper in half to form a semi-circle (if using round
wrappers) or a triangle (if using square wrappers).  Seal the edges
by moistening them with a little water and pinching them.  You may
freeze the dumplings at this point on a cookie sheet or continue to
use them by frying, steaming or in a soup.

To Fry:  Heat oil in a wok or frying pan to 360 degrees.  Fry about
10 at a time for 3 minutes or until golden.

To Steam:  Arrange on lightly oiled plate, but do not let them touch
each other.  Pour about 2 inches of boiling water into a wok, set the
plates in the steamer and set the steamer in the wok.  Cover the
steamer and cook over medium heat for 20 minutes.

Skillet Method:  In a 12" skillet heat 2 tablespoons of oil until
hot. Fill the skillet with mandu, making sure that they do not touch.
Cook until the bottoms brown; about 1 minute.  Add 1/3 cup water or
beef broth to the skillet and cover and cood for about 10 minutes.

Serve Yakimandu with Dipping sauce.
