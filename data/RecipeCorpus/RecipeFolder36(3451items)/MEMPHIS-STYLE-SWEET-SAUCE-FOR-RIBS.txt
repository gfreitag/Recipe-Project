Title: MEMPHIS STYLE SWEET SAUCE FOR RIBS
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Bbq/grill
Yield: 1 quarts
1 tb Paprika; Hungarian, mild
1 tb Seasoned Salt
1 1/2 tb Garlic Powder; or 5 cloves
-fresh garlic, minced fine
1/8 ts Chili Powder
1/8 ts Anaheim Chili/cayenne
1/8 ts White Pepper
Black Pepper; freshly ground
1/8 ts Numex Chili Powder
1    Neem leaf; crushed or Bay
8 oz Tomato Sauce
1/2 c  Spicy Honey Mustard
1 c  Catsup
1 c  Red Wine Vinegar
c  Water
1/4 c  Worcestershire; smoked
1/4 c  Worcestershire Sauce;regular
1/4 c  Oil
2 tb Tabasco Sauce
1 tb Lemon Juice
2 tb Brown Sugar
Combine ingredients in a large heavy weight Dutch oven. Bring
:
to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
I like to serve this sauce at the table and not baste the
:
ribs with it while they are on the grill. If you paint this sauce on
while the ribs are hot but off from the fire they will glaze and very
slightly brown.
Baste the ribs with this marinade only during the last half hour of
cooking, to glaze the ribs and make them slightly brown...
If this sauce is put on the ribs too early the sugar will blacken the
outside of the ribs and be unpleasant looking but not bad tasting....
The goal is NOT to blacken the outside of the ribs at all, so I
usually serve the sauce at the table near the ribs..... Enjoy this
sauce.

you with the most mouth watering ribs you ever locked a lip on....
