To prepare stuffing, melt butter in skillet and when bubbling saute
onion, parsley and mushrooms 5 min. Mix in anchovies, breadcrumbs and
shrimp or cooked fish. Toss and mix in beaten egg. Rinse and dry
fish; sprinkle inside with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Lard fish
across back with bacon strips. Stuff the fish and truss with skewers
or sew shut.

Spread a little melted butter in a baking dish; add fish and top with
onion slices and parsley. Pour the rest of the butter over the fish
and vegetables. Bake 45 min basting frequently with wine or stock.
Add sour cream to the pan not on the fish for the last 10 min. When
fish is done remove trussing and serve on a heated platter garnished
with the vegetables and covered with the sauce.
