There are almost as many versions of this delicious cold meat as
there are cooks in Ireland.

Method: Thoroughly mix dry ingredients; blend in molasses. Place beef
in a bowl; coat on all sides with spice mixture. Cover with plastic
wrap and refrigerate for 7 days, rubbing spice mixture into meat once
or twice every day.

Put meat in pot. Add Guiness and water to cover. Cover pan; simmer
about 3 hours till tender but not falling apart. Remove from heat,
uncover, and let cool in stock. Lift meat from liquid; wrap in
plastic or foil. Set on platter, with weight on top of meat.
Refrigerate overnight, until very cold. Slice very thin.
