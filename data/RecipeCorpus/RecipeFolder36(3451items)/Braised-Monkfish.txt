1 c  Dry white wine
1 cn (28oz) whole

2 ts Thyme, chopped or
1 ts Dried thyme
Black pepper to taste
2 ts Olive oil
2    Heads garlic

2 oz Sliced prosciutto,

2 1/2 lb Monkfish
Preheat oven to 425 F.

In a large non-stick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add garlic
cloves and cook, stirring, for about 5 min, or until the garlic is
golden. Add prosciutto and cook for 1 min more. Move the garlic and
prosciutto to the side of the pan. Add fish to the pan and cook for 3
min per side, or until browned.

Transfer the fish into a shallow 3-quart baking dish. Pour wine into
the skillet and bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up any brown
bits. Add tomatoes and thyme. Simmer the sauce, stirring to break up
the tomatoes, for about 5 min. Season with a generous grinding of
pepper; pour sauce over the fish. Cover with a tent of aluminum foil
and bake for 20-30 min, or until the fish is opaque in the center.
Serve over hot cooked rice.
