Title: Hollandaise Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 cup
-Salt and pepper
2 ts Lemon juice (approximately)
6 oz Butter
3    Egg yolks
2 tb Water
Melt the butter.  In a small, heavy saucepan set over the lowest
possible heat, whisk the egg yolks with the water, 1/2 teaspoon salt,
and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Whisk constantly until the mixture is light
and and creamy.  Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the warm
butter in a thin stream.  Squeeze in lemon juice to taste and salt
and pepper if needed.

Hollandaise depends on the emulsification of the butter for its creamy
consistency.  The addition of egg yolks makes emulsification less
tricky. The greatest danger in making the sauce is overheating, which
can cook the yolks and cause the sauce to separate.  This sauce is
best served immediately, but it can be kept warm for a short period
by placing it in a tepid water bath or using a wide-mouthed thermos
and whisking periodically.

Yield: 1 cup.
