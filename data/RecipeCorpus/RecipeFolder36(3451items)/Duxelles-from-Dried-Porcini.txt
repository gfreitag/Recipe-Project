There are many times you want a mushroom extract made from dried
porcini. Here's a way to make use of the mushrooms that remain.

Place the butter and onion in a small saute pan over medium heat.
Saute for 2 min. Add the mushrooms, soy sauce, salt and sugar and
continue to saute for another 2 min. Let cool and refrigerate. Can be
refrigerated for 1 week or frozen indefinitely.

Note: Use to cover meat of fish, or as a filling for ravioli or
tortellini. Or wrap them in wonton skins and use in soup.
