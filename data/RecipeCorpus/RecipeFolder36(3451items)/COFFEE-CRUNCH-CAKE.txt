Title: COFFEE CRUNCH CAKE
Categories: Cake/cookie, Breads
Yield: 12 servings
1 tb Soda; sifted
1    (10-in.) angel food cake
2 c  Whipping cream
2 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 c  Sugar; plus...
2 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Strong coffee
1/4 c  Light corn syrup
Combine 1 1/2 cups sugar, coffee and corn syrup in saucepan at least 5
inches deep. Bring mixture to boil and cook to 310F on candy
thermometer or hard-crack stage (small amount of mixture dropped into
cold water will break with brittle snap). Remove syrup from heat,
immediately add soda and stir vigorously just until mixture thickens
and pulls away from sides of pan. (Mixture will foam rapidly when
soda is added. Do not destroy foam by excessive beating.) Immediately
pour foamy mass into ungreased 9-inch square metal pan (do not spread
or stir). Let stand without moving until cool. When ready to garnish
cake, knock hardened mixture out of pan and crush between sheets of
waxed paper with rolling pin to form coarse crumbs. Split cake into 4
equal layers. Combine cream, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and
vanilla in chilled bowl and beat until stiff. Spread about 1/2 of
cream between layers and remainder over top and sides of cake.
Sprinkle generously with crushed topping. Refrigerate until ready to
serve.
