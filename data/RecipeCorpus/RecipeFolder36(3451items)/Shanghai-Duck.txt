The Chinese do not make a fetish of crispiness in their ducks, but of
course the mass-produced Long Island ducks are fatter than anything
that would be available in China or even Taiwan. What's more, the
Chinese do not make a fetish of leanness, either. Here's a recipe
that is neither crisp nor lean:

The duck should be prepared as for roasting - feathers discarded,
excess fat from the cavity removed (you may render this to make a
fine, if unhealthy, cooking fat).

Arrange scallions, ginger slices, star anise, and the neck and
giblets in the bottom of a heavy kettle. Put the duck in, breast
down, and pour all the remaining ingredients over. Cover tightly
(using foil as a sealer if necessary) and bring to a boil. Reduce
heat to low and simmer 45 min. Uncover and invert duck. Re-cover and
cook 30 min. At this point, uncover and skim off accumulated fat
(this also makes a fine, if unhealthy, cooking fat). Check duck for
doneness - it should be just about tender now. Raise heat to medium
and cook 15 to 30 min, basting constantly. The skin should become
dark brown (although not crispy by any stretch of the imagination)
and the sauce should be reduced to a syrup. Serve hot on a platter
with the sauce strained over.
