The Yuletide holidays in Australia are known as the 'silly season', a
time for crowning the Cockroach Queen, competitive sky diving and the
tossing of the equivalent of a telephone pole.  In the land Down
Under, Christmas is a balmy summer of surf championships, yacht
racing and cricket matches.  To be sure, Australians celebrate the
holidays with the age old traditions of caroling, Christmas tree and
Santa Claus, but leave it to the saucy Aussies, to accentuate their
climatic difference. In Western Australia, Boxing Day, December 26,
is celebrated with cheery competitive madness where folks participate
in the Cockroach Crawl, the Tinnie (can of beer) Toss and the Lemon
Drop seed spit.  The culmination of the day results in the annual
crowning of the Cockroach Queen. Come Christmas day in the remote
desert mining town of Coober Pedy, South Australians retreat
underground, not to dig in their opal mines, but to escape the heat
and worship in one fo the five underground churches. Finally a quaint
custom that has developed in some parts of Australia over the years
is that of celebrating Christmas in the middle of the year. These
festivities, known as Yulesfest are a cheery manner of indulging in
hot roast meals and heavy Christmas pudding during the cooler winter
months. Origin: Newspaper insert, Caribou Observer, December 21, 1994.
