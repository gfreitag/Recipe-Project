Title: Pita Bread
Categories: Breadmaker, Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 ts Salt
3 c  Bread flour
2 1/4 ts Yeast
1 c  Water -- plus 3 tbsp
1 tb Shortening
3/4 ts Sugar
Add all ingredients to machine and program for dough and first rise.
Remove dough and punch down and let rest for 5 minutes.  Place 13 x 9
baking pan in oven.  Preheat oven to 500.  On lightly floured work
surface, cut dough in half and cut each half into 6 equal pieces.
Lightly sprinkle with flour.  Shape pieces into smooth balls.  With a
lightly floured rolling pin, roll each ball into a 4" disk.  Lightly
sprinkle both sides with flour.  Cover with a clean kitchen cloth and
let rise 30 minutes on work surface.  Place four pita breads on
preheated baking pan. Bake about 5 minutes or until breads puff up
and just begin to brown. Remove from oven and cool on wire rack.
Continue baking remaining pita breads, four at a time.  Breads will
collapse as they cool.  If they don't, prick them with a fork.
