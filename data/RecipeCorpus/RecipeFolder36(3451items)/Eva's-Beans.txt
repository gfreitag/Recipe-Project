Title: Eva's Beans
Categories: Tex/mexican, Vegetables
Yield: 1 batch
8    Jalapeno peppers, seeded
-cut into strips
4 c  Water
2 c  Beer
1 tb Mexican oregano
2 ts Ground cumin
1 c  Chopped cilantro
Salt to taste
2 c  Pinto beans, washed and
-picked over
8    Roma tomatoes, seeded
-and chopped
1/2 lb Sliced bacon, cut
-into squares
1 lg White onion, diced
1 cl Garlic, crushed
(Eva's beans were HOT, if you don't tolerate hot stuff well, feel
free to reduce the amount of peppers)

Place all ingredients except salt and cilantro in a large pot.  Bring
to a boil, cover, and remove from the heat.  Allow mixture to stand
for 1 hour.

Return the pot to the heat, and simmer until the beans are tender.
Add cilantro and salt to taste.

Remove about 1 cup of the cooked beans from the pot, along with some
of the cooking liquid.  Mash the beans into the cooking liquid, and
return the bean puree to the pot.  Stir to combine.

These may be served as an accompaniment to a meal, or as a meal in
themselves, accompanied by a stack of flour tortillas.

Eva insisted that these beans did not reheat well, and should be made
fresh daily.  I disagree -- the leftovers are great.
