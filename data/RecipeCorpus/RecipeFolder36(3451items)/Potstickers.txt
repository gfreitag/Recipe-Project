Title: Potstickers
Categories: Appetizers, Chinese
Yield: 24 servings
Chili oil
Rice vinegar
24    Potsticker wrappers
3 tb Oil
2/3 c  Chicken broth
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/3 c  Chicken broth
1 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Cornstarch
1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts White pepper
2 oz Chinese sausage -- chopped
6    Dried black mushrooms
1 c  Cabbage -- sliced
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 lb Ground turkey
2 c  Napa cabbage -- sliced
3    Green onions -- chopped
1 tb Ginger root -- minced
Soak mushrooms in warm water to cover until softened, about 15
minutes; drain.  Trim and discard stems.  Finely chop caps.  Combine
regular cabbage and salt in a bowl; let stand for 15 minutes.
Squeeze to remove excess liquid.  Place mushrooms, cabbage and
remaining filling ingredients in a bowl; mix well.  Place a frying
pan over high heat until hot.  Add chinese sausage and cook until fat
is rendered, about 1 minute.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Add
to filling and mix well.  To fill each potsticker, place a heaping
teaspoon of filling in center of potsticker wrapper; keep remaining
wrappers covered to prevent drying.  Brush edges of wrapper in half,
crimping one side to form a semi-circle.  Pinch edges to seal.  Set
potsticker down on a baking sheet, seam side up so that potsticker
will sit flat.  Cover filled potstickers with a dry towel. Place a
wide frying pan over medium heat until hot.  Add 1 1/2 tbsp oil ,
swirling to coat sides.  Add potstickers, half at a time, seam side
up. Cook until bottoms are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add 1/3 cup
broth; reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until liquid is absorbed,
5 to 6 minutes.  Place potstickers, browned side up, on a serving
plate with chili oil and rice vinegar on the side.
