Red Pepper Puree:
Preheat the broiler. Place the peppers in a pan and put in the
broiler. Broiler for 10-12 min, or until the skins shrivel and begin
to blacken. Remove the peppers; place them in a paper bag and let
cool. Peel the skin entirely from the peppers, then slit them open
and remove the stem, seeds, and veins. Place the roasted peppers in a
blender or food processor and add the lemon juice, sugar, and salt.
Blend to a smooth puree. Set aside.

Watercress Sauce:
In a blender or food processor, combine the watercress, 2 tbs water,
and the vinegar until pureed. Pour into a medium saucepan and add the
cream. Bring to a simmer and add fish sauce to taste. If necessary,
thicken lightly by adding the cornstarch mixture and cooking until
slightly thickened. Keep warm.

Cream of Rice Soup:
Bring 5 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Add the rice while
stirring, bring back to a boil, then turn down to a simmer. Cover and
cook for 30 min.

While the rice is cooking, place 2 cups of water in a small saucepan.
Add the porcini, salt, sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, onion, curry
powder, and paprika. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and
simmer for 20 min.

Combine the cooked rice with its liquid, the mushroom mixture with its
liquid, and the milk in a blender. Blend until smooth, adding more
milk if necessary and adjusting for salt.

Stir in 3 tbs red pepper puree. Put into bowl and swirl a teaspoon of
watercress sauce in each.

Note: You may substitute any fresh herb for the watercress.
