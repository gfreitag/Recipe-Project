1 ts Vanila
4    Eggs; large
1/4 ts Ginger
1/4 ts Cinnamon
3    Jalepenos; medium size
32 oz Cream cheese

1/2 c  Sour cream
1/8 c  Sugar
Combine all crust ingredients;  press into the bottom of a 10 inch
spring form pan;  bake for 10 minutes at 350f;  cool
Beat the cream cheese and sour cream until smooth;  add all other
cheese cake ingredients slowly, beating after each addition until
smooth; pour onto crust; bake 1 hour at 225f.
Combine all topping ingredients;  whip to a froth; pour over
cheesecake; bake 15 minutes at 300f.
Cool slowly; chill before serving
Garnish with whipped topping or fruit as desired.
NOTE:
It is supposed to be a little mushy when done rather than solid
like most cheesecakes, however if you prefer a "normal"
cheesecake raise the temp about 25 degrees and cook a little
longer.   The original recipe called for serving warmed (nuked),
I like it chilled with "Union Grill Strawberry Sauce" on top
