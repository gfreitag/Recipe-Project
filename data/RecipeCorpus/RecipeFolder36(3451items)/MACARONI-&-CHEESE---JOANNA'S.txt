MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
2 tb Butter
3/4 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
1    Roll (hard crust sourdough
- or french roll)
Cook macaroni according to package directions.

In large saucepan, melt butter.  Add onion and cook until tender.
Stir in flour, salt. mustard, salt and pepper. All milk slowly,
stirring constantly, and cook until sauce is thickened and bubbly.
Add cheese and stir until melted.  Combine cooked macaroni and cheese
mixture and mix well. Pour into buttered casserole. (I use one that's
about 12" square). Top with topping and bake in 375 oven for 20 - 25
minutes.

To make topping:  tear roll apart and use steel blade of food
processor to chop into fine bread crumbs. Melt better in small
saucepan then add crumbs and toss until covered with butter. Combine
buttered crumbs with cheese and spread over casserole.

I generally serve this with sauteed Kielbasa.

Kraft's Macaroni and Cheese is great and I always have boxes in the
cupboard as it's something my son can make in a hurry. However, "sure
doesn't compare to Mom's!"

As with many of my recipes, I evolved this from one I originally
found on a macaroni box.
