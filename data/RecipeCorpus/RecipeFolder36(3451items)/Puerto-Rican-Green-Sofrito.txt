Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan. Add the onion,

and translucent but not brown, about 5 min, stirring with a wooden
spoon.

Stir in the cilantro, parsley, culentro, salt and pepper. cook the
mixture for a minute or two longer. Correct the seasoning, adding
salt and pepper to taste.

Transfer to a clean glass jar. Refrigerated, it will keep for up to 1
week.

Note: Use sofrito as a starting point for soups, stews, and rice
dishes. Add it to your favorite tomato sauce for pasta.

Note: To make Salsa Verde, mince  1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley as finely
as possible. Wrap the parsley in a clean dishcloth. Tightly twist the
cloth to wring out the parsley juice into the salsa. This gives the
sauce a rich green hue. Stir in 1 tbs finely chopped capers, 1 tbs
chopped pitted green olives, and 1 tbs butter and cook for 1 min
more. Goes great with grilled seafood. Refrigerated, it will keep for
up to 1 week.
