Title: TOFU/MISO/UMEBOSHI(SALTED PRESERVED PLUMS) OKAYU
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
Salted plums---umeboshi (to
Taste)
1    Cake kinugoshi tofu
1 c  Fresh spinach
1 c  Fresh nappa cabbage
1/8 ts Sake or mirin (optional)
1 c  Short grained japanese style
Rice (wash thoroughly)
4 c  Water
2    3 rounded tablespoon white
Miso paste (more or less to
Taste)
1    Or 2 large salted preserved
"Okayu" - Japanese-style porridge.

While you wait for your water to boil:

Break apart tofu into little chunks (dice or just use hands) Wash
spinach well and cut into 1/4" segments Wash nappa cabbage and cut
into 1/4" segments take seed out of umeboshi and cut into small pieces

When water is at a nice rolling boil:

Add miso (make sure it completely dissolves in water) (At this stage,
taste to make sure you have enough miso in water and add more miso or
water for desired taste.) Add rice, tofu, spinach, nappa cabbage, and
umeboshi Add mirin or sake (optional)

Once the mixture come back to a nice boil, put cover on pot and
reduce heat to low simmer for 30 minutes.  Stir occasionally.  Cook
longer if you like a more creamier porridge.

This makes a nice replacement for soup on a cold day.  If eaten as a
meal, I like to puree some raw daikon with a tiny smidgin of fresh
ginger, lemon juice, and soy sauce as a garnish on top of my okayu.
