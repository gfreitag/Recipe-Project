Spread the honey evenly over the racks of lamb.  Sprinkle on the
thyme.

Preheat the oven to 475øF.  Place the racks of lamb in a baking pan
and roast them for 15 to 18 minutes, or until they are golden brown
and soft to the touch.  Remove the lamb and let it rest.

In a small skillet place the butter and heat it on medium high until
it has melted.  Add the chanterelle mushrooms and saut them for 3 to
4 minutes, or until they are tender.  Season them with the salt and
the pepper.

Slice the racks of lamb between the bones.

In the center of each of 4 individual serving plates place a portion
of the Lentils.  Spoon the Port Wine Sauce around them.  Place the
lamb on top of the Lentils.  Place the mushrooms around the lamb.

Lentils: In a medium large saucepan place the bacon and fry it on
medium high heat for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the carrots and onions.
Saut them for 3 to 4 minutes, or until they are tender and the bacon
is brown.  Add the lentils, chicken stock, thyme, salt and pepper.

Bring the liquid to a boil and then reduce it to a simmer.  Cook the
lentils for 1 hour, or until they are tender.  Add more chicken stock
if necessary.

Port Wine Sauce: In a medium saucepan place the shallots and the Tawny
Port.  Heat them on medium low for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the
liquid is reduced to 1/4.

Add the veal stock and cook the ingredients for 20 to 30 minutes, or
until the liquid is reduced to 1/4.  Add the salt and the pepper, and
stir them in.  Strain the sauce.
