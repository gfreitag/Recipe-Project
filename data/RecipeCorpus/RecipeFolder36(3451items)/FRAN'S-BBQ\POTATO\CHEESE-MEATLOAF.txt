Yield: 2 meatloaves
1/4 c  Mustard
1/4 c  Ketchup
2 c  Potatoes; mashed
1 c  Cheese
2 lb Ground beef
4 sl Bread; crumbled
2 c  Baked beans

This is another one of those recipes I made up by combining 3 or 4
other recipes, or parts of them anyway. And of course a couple of
things added just off the top of my head. It is YUMMY!

Mash up the baked beans.  Mix everything together except the potatoes
and the cheese.  Add more liquid or bread as needed to reach desired
consistancy.

Press mixture into the bottom and around sides of two 9x5" loaf pans,
leaving a large trough in the center.  Reserve about 1-1/2 cups of
mixture to cover top with.

Fill troughs of each meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  Cut cheese into
cubes, or grate, and put this on top of the potatoes.

Cover potatoes and cheese with reserved meat mixture. ake for 1 hour
at 350 degrees.
