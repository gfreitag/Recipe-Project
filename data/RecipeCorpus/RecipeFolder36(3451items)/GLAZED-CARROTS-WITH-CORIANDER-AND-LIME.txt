Roughly crush 1 tablespoon of coriander seeds and boil in 1 1/2 pints
of water with a vegetable stock cube and a strip of lemon zest for 5
minutes. Strain, reserving the broth, and discard the seeds and zest.
Pull a bunch of carrots (about 1 lb when prepared) and scrub but do
not peel them. Cut off the leaves, leaving a few with top knots on for
decoration. Cook the carrots in the coriander broth until nearly done
and then drain, saving the broth.

Heat 4 oz of butter in a wok or frying pan, add the carrots, 2
teaspoons of sugar and about 1 pint of the reserved broth. Toss over
high heat until the liquid has almost boiled away and the carrots are
coated in a shiny glaze. Add a good squeeze of lime juice and some
fine shreds of lime zest. Toss again and serve scattered with tiny
sprigs of fresh coriander. This is sufficient for four to six people.
