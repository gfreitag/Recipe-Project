Put flour into a food processor fitted with a metal blade. As soon as
water comes to a boil, with the machine running, pour down the feed
tube in a steady stream. Process until dough forms a rough ball and
pulls away from sides, about 30 seconds. Turn out onto a work
surface. Flour lightly and knead until dough no longer feels sticky
and has a firm, smooth consistency, about 2 minutes. Cover and let
rest while preparing filling.

Put half the cabbage leaves in a food processor. Pulse 4-5 times to a
coarse mince. Remove. Process remaining cabbage in same manner. Wrap
cabbage in a towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. You
should have about 1 1/4 cups. Set aside.

With processor running, drop ginger, green onions and cilantro down
feed tube; process until finely minced, about 15 seconds. Add salt,
white pepper, sugar, soy sauce, wine, sesame oil and cornstarch;
pulse to mix. Add pork; process until finely ground, about 20
seconds. Return cabbage to processor; pulse to mix. Do not puree.
Remove to a bowl, cover and refrigerate.

Dust dough with flour. Knead 2-3 minute,s or until smooth. Roll out
to an 1/8" thick sheet. Cut out 4" rounds; keep covered.

Put 1 tb filling in center of a round. Bring sides of round up over
filling and pinch edge of top of arc to seal. On curved rim of near
side, make 3 small pleats to the left of center; make 3 pleats in the
opposite direction along the other side. Pinch pleated side together
with unpleated side to enclose filling to make a 1/2" flat border on
top. Set dumpling on flat surface with its pleated side facing away
from you. Put both thumbs on the smooth side pushing filling forward
away from you while pulling ends toward you to form a pouch or belly.
Gently flatten dumpling's bottom to create a platform. Set on a tray,
cover and refrigerate, or freeze until ready to cook. Repeat, making
remaining dumplings.

Heat a 9" nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil and arrange
8-10 dumplings platform side down in skillet, touching each other in
a spiral fashion. Fry until bottoms are browned and crusty, about 1
minute. (Lift one to check.)

Add enough diluted chicken stock to come halfway up dumplings; bring
to a boil. Reduce to a low boil and cover; cook until liquid has been
reduced (about 7 minutes.) Gently shake pan from time to time. Pan
should not be dry before cooking time is up; therefore, add water if
it reduces too quickly. Remove cover and nudge with a spatula to
loosen dumplings. Increase heat to high, and fry until pan is dry and
dumpling bottoms are crisp, about 30 seconds. Invert a 8-9" flat
plate over potstickers an turn pan upside down. Repeat with remaining
dumplings.

Combine dipping sauce ingredients together, stir once or twice and
serve with dumplings.
