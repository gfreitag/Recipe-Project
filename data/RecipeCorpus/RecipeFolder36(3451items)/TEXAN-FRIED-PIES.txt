pastry circle. Moisten edges of pastry, fold in half, making sure
edges are even. Press edges of pastry together using a fork dipped in
flour. Heat 1" of oil to 375F in a large skillet. Cook pies until
golden brown on both sides, turning once.  Drain well on paper
towels. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, granulated sugar or
sugar/cinnamon mixture.
Other fruits may be substituted.  Prepare them as you would for a
pie.
