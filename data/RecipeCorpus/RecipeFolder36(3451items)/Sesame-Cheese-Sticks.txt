Categories: Appetizers, Breads, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Cheddar cheese, sharp **
1 tb Or 2 milk
1/4 c  Sesame seeds
1 c  Flour, all-purpose
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 c  Butter, cut into bits, *
* butter should be at room temperature.
** Sharp cheddar cheese should be finely grated
Preheat the oven to 400 F degrees.
In a bowl, sift together the flour, salt, and pepper.  Blend in butter
until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add the cheese and mix well.
Gradually add enough of the milk to make a sticky dough.  On a lightly
floured surface, roll out the dough 3/4-inch thick.  Sprinkle on the
sesame seeds and press them lightly into the dough.  Cut the dough
into 1/2 inch wide strips, 2 inches long.    Place the strips of
dough on an ungreased baking sheet.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or
until golden brown and crisp.  Cool on a wire rack and store in a
covered tin. THE PENNYWHISTLE LUNCH BOX BOOK - jean hores
