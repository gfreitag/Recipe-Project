Title: ROBB'S DRIED FRUIT CREAM SCONES
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 dozen
MMMMM---------------------------SCONES--------------------------------
1/2 c  Chopped dried fruit
(apricots, prunes, etc)
1/4 c  Golden raisins
1 1/4 c  Heavy cream
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Sugar
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
Sugar
3 tb Butter, melted
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Use an ungreased baking sheet.

Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a bowl, stirring
with a fork to mix well.  Add the dried fruit and raisins.  Still
using a fork, stir in the cream and mix until the dough holds
together in a rough mass (the dough will be quite sticky).

Lightly flour a board and transfer the dough to it.  Knead the dough
8 or 9 times.  Pat into a circle about 10 inches round.  For the
glaze, spread the butter over the top and side of the circle of dough
and sprinkle sugar on top.  Cut the circle into 12 wedges and place
each piece on the baking sheet, allowing about an inch between pieces.

Bake for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
