Title: Spinach Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Vegetables
Yield: 1 cup
1 tb Rice wine vinegar
1 pn Nutmeg
1 tb Pernod
1    Vitamin C pill, crushed *
Salt and pepper to taste
4 tb Olive oil
2    Shallots
Finely diced
1 lb Bag spinach
Rinsed well and dried
Stems removed
* The vitamin C tablet will slow down the oxidation process, keeping
the sauce a nice green color longer.

Heat the oil over high heat in a large saute pan. Add the shallots and
saute for 1 min, then add the spinach leaves to the pan. Cover and
let the spinach "sweat" for 1 min.

Remove the pan from the heat and place the contents in a food
processor along with the remaining ingredients. Process on high until
well combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Variation;
To make a warm dip for pita bread, fold in some grated Swiss cheese.
