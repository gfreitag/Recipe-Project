Title: Mung Bean Salad w/Star Anise, Garlic, and Lime
Categories: Salads, Asian
Yield: 4 servings
2    Scallions
Green and white, minced
1 pn Red pepper flakes
4    Heads Belgian endive
Ends discarded, shredded
1 c  Dried mung beans
2 tb Sugar
4    Star anise pods
Juice of 1 lime
2 tb Canola oil
Place beans in colander, rinse, and pick over them. Put beans in large
stockpot, cover with cold water, and soak for at least 3 hours, or
overnight. Drain beans.

In a large heavy pot, cover the beans with cold water and bring to a
boil. Skim the surface when the water reaches a boil. Cover and cook
for about 1 hour or until the beans are tender, skimming the surface
occasionally to remove any scum that rises to the surface. Drain into
a colander and rinse under cold running water to cool.

Cook the sugar, stirring constantly, in a heavy skillet over low heat
until it dissolves and caramelizes, about 3 min. Add the star anise
and lime juice and stir until the sugar completely dissolves. Remove
from the heat.

Place the mung beans in a large bowl. Add the caramel mixture, then
the oil, scallions, and red pepper flakes. Stir well and let cool to
room temperature. Remove the star anise. Serve the beans on shredded
endive.
