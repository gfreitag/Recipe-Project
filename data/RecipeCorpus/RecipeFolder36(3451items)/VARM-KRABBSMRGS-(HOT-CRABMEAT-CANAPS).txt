Categories: West europe, Appetizers, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 24 pieces
1 tb Butter
1 tb Flour
1    Egg yolk
1 c  Light cream
6 sl White bread; home-style
1/2 lb Crabmeat; fresh, frozen or
-canned, drained & picked
1 tb Dry sherry
1 ts Salt
1/8 ts White pepper
1 tb Fresh dill; chopped
In a large mixing bowl, combine the crabmeat, sherry, salt, pepper and
dill and set aside. Melt the tablespoon of butter without browning it
in a small, heavy saucepan, remove from the heat and stir in the
flour. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolk with the cream and briskly
stir this mixture into the butter-flour roux with a wire whisk.
Return the pan to the heat and cook slowly, whisking constantly for a
minute or two until the mixture thickens; do not let it boil. Pour
the sauce over the crabmeat mixture in the bowl and stir together
with a spoon until the ingredients are well combined. Taste for
seasoning.
Cut four rounds from each slice of bread, using a small cookie cutter
or glass. Toast the bread rounds on one side only under a moderately
hot broiler. Remove and spread the untoasted side of each round
generously with the crabmeat mixture, mounding it slightly. These may
be prepared in advance up to this point and then refrigerated. Just
before serving, place under a hot broiler for a minute or so until
the canaps brown slightly. Serve very hot.
