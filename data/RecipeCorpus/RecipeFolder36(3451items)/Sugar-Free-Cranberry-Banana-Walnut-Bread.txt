Categories: Breads, Fruit, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-----------------------FRUIT AND NUTS----------------------------
1 1/2 c  Fresh or frozen cranberries
1/2 c  Walnuts
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1 ts Baking soda
2 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
1 ts Cinnamon
MMMMM----------------------WET INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Unsweetened orange juice
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Mashed ripe bananas
1/2 c  Fruit sweetener
1/2 c  Oil
1/4 ts Grated orange zest

1 ts Baking powder
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray two loaf pans with
lecithin spray. Toast the walnuts in the preheated oven for 7-10
minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool. Then coarsely
chop them with a knife or using a pulsing action in a food processor,
and put them aside. Wash and sort the cranberries, coarsely chop them
with a knife or with the pulsing action in a food processor and put
them aside. Sift the dry ingredients together. Use an electric mixer
on medium speed to whisk together the sweetener, oil, and orange
zest, until thickened, about five minutes. Add the eggs, one at a
time beating well after each addition. Reduce speed and stir in the
orange juice, vanilla and mashed bananas. On low speed, slowly add
the sifted dry ingredients, walnuts, and cranberries. Mix just until
blended, being careful not to over mix. Pour the batter into the
prepared loaf pans. Bake the loaves on the middle shelf in the
preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the
center of each loaf comes out clean. Cool the loaves slightly before
removing them from the pans and cooling them on a wire rack. Wrap the
cooled loaves in plastic wrap and let them sit for a few hours to
overnight at room temperature before slicing.
