Boil 5 cups of water and add 5 chicken bouillon cubes.  Mix until
fully dissolved.  Combine pork, cabbage, onions, ginger, parsley,
salt, pepper, sugar, cornstarch, soy sauce, and sherry.  Place a
spoonful of filling in center of wrapper and brush 180 degrees of
wrapper lightly with water and close potsticker.  Press firmly or use
your fingers to pinch edges together.
Add 1/2 tablespoon peanut oil to non-stick skillet over medium heat.
Arrange gyoza in pan just barely touching each other.  Brown on one
side only until it forms a golden brown crust.  Add 1/2 cup chicken
stock and bring to a boil.  Cover; reduce to a slow boil and steam
for 8 minutes. Remove the cover and cook over medium heat until all
the liquid is absorbed and fully cooked.  Repeat the steps until all
the gyozas are cooked.
