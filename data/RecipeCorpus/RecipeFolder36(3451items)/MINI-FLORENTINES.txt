Title: MINI FLORENTINES
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 60 cookies
1 oz Mixed peel; finely chopped
2 ts Lemon juice
4 oz Chocolate
--(half plain & half white)
2 oz Butter
2 oz Caster sugar
2 oz Glace' cherries
-- finely chopped
3 oz Hazelnuts; finely chopped
Melt the butter in a saucepan, then add the sugar and bring to the
boil, stirring all the time.  Remove from the heat and stir in the
cherries, hazelnuts, peel and lemon juice.  Allow to cool slightly
while you line two baking sheets with nonstick paper.

Set the oven to 180 C/350 F/ Gas Mark 4.

Put little heaps of the mixture, about the size of a hazelnut, on the
sheets, leaving room for them to spread.  Bake for 5-6 minutes, until
they are a light golden brown.  Push the edges in with a knife to
neaten, then leave them to cool on the paper.

Melt the chocolate in two separate bowls set over saucepans of
simmering water, or in a microwave for 3-4 minutes, then spread over
the smooth side of the florentines.  Just before the chocolate sets,
make wavy lines with a fork.  Leave to cool completely.
