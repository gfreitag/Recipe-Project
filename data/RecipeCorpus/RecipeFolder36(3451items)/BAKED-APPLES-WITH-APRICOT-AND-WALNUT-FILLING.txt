Title: BAKED APPLES WITH APRICOT AND WALNUT FILLING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 2 servings
1 tb Unsalted butter; softened
2    Granny Smith apples
1/4 c  Orange juice; fresh
1/4 c  Apricots;dried, firmly
-packed, chopped
1/4 c  Walnuts; chopped
1/4 c  Light brown sugar; packed
In a small bowl combine well the apricots, the walnuts, the brown
sugar, and the butter. Core the apples, making each opening large
enough to hold half the apricot mixture, peel the top third of each
apple, and fill the cavities with the apricot mixture. Arrange the
apples in a deep 2 1/2-quart microwave-safe baking dish so that they
do not touch one another or the sides of the dish, pour the orange
juice around them, and microwave the apples on high power (lOO%),
covered with micro wave-safe plastic wrap, for 7 minutes. Pierce the
plastic wrap with the tip of a sharp knife and let the apples stand
covered, for 5 minutes, or until they are tender.
