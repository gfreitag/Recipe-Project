4    Pork chops
MMMMM-------------------------SEASONINGS------------------------------
1 ds Celery seeds
1 ds Onion powder
1 ds Garlic powder
3/4 c  Sugar, brown
3/4 tb Paprika
3/4 tb Chili powder
Stir seasoning ingredients together.  Lay half of chops in glass pan.
Cover with half of brown sugar mixture.  Repeat, making second layer
with remaining chops and mixture.  Refrigerate to marinate for 12-24
hrs. Mixture will become somewhat liquid while marinating.

Charcoal grill or broil chops to desired doneness.

Sylvia's comments: I have always had awful results from pork chops,
so I sliced about 1-1/4 lb center-cut pork loin (on sale, $1.99/lb)
into 12 thin medallions and marinated them.  The combination of sweet
and chili powder was interesting but not worth making again.
