Title: Sweet Granola
Categories: Snacks
Yield: 4 pounds
1 c  Shredded coconut
3/4 c  Shelled, unsalted
Pumpkin seeds
1/2 c  Pine nuts
1/2 c  Shelled, unsalted
Pistachio nuts
1/2 c  Shelled pecans
Coarsely chopped
4 oz (1 stick) butter
3/4 c  Honey
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1 1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
1 lb Rolled oats
1 1/2 c  Shelled, unsalted
Sunflower seeds
1 1/2 c  Slivered almonds
Preheat the oven to 325 F.

Place the butter, honey, sugar and vanilla in a heavy, medium
saucepan and melt over low heat until smooth.

Place the remaining ingredients in a large mixing bowl and combine
well. Slowly stir in the butter mixture, making sure that each grain
is evenly coated. Spread the granola mixture onto an ungreased baking
sheet and bake for 25 min, or until the grains become crisp and very
lightly browned, stirring occasionally to prevent the granola from
sticking to the pan and burning.

Remove the granola from the oven and let cool. It will get crunchier
as it cools. Can be stored at room temperature in airtight containers
or in the freezer in plastic bags.
