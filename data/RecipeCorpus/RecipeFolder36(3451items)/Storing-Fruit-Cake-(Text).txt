-they are to be served.
-Storing is an important
Factor in the success of
-the cake.
Most cakes become moist and
-mellow and improve in
-flavour if they are
Baked a few weeks before
For best results, let the cake cool completely after it has come out
of the oven. Make several holes through the cake with a skewer and
pour in heated (but not boiled) brandy. Moisten cheesecloth with
sherry or brandy (not table wine) and wrap it around the cake.
Finally wrap the cake in foil and store it in tightly covered tin in
a cool place. Although there is no need to refrigerate a fruit cake,
it should be checked periodically to insure that it hasn't become too
moist or too dry. If it is too moist, there is a danger of moulding.
To avoid this, let the cake air for a while. If the cake becomes dry,
moisten the cheesecloth again with sherry or brandy.
Cakes will cometimes kep for months, sometimes years if they are
stored properly.
