This recipe dates to sometime in the 1915-1920 range,and was an old
recipe then! Persimmons are the fruit of the Persimmon tree,the tree
is used for lumber, and finishes to a beautiful lustre.

Persimmons are like miniature pumpkins, with a dusty-grayish-orange
look, about 1" to 1 1/2" in diameter, with a strawberry-like hull on
the top. They
form as the summer continues, and nothing I know of will eat them
from the tree! Too bitter!

They are NOT edible until AFTER the second frost, and then they
usually fall
from the tree. Harvest them from the ground, picking them carefully,
so as to avoid bruised spots, bird pecks, and general dirt.

Without being frozen, they are as bitter as gall! After freezing,the
tannin (?) turns sweet, and they can be eaten raw. Take care to clean
them carefully, take out the seeds, and put them in the freezer. 48
hours later, take them out, let them thaw for several hours, and
re-freeze them. Repeat the freezing-thawing 3 or 4 times. Test them
carefully to see that they have
turned sweet. There will be no doubt in your mind if they have not!

Combine well and allow the mixture to raise. (time unknown)
When it has risen, then add

cup milk

Stir well and bake in a moderate oven, time unspecified,
~-Mom was from the old school!, and my sister tells me that
this recipe was given to my mother by my great Grand-mother.

It's possible that this recipe dates back to the middle 1800's.
