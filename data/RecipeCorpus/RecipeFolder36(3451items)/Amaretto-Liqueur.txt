Title: Amaretto Liqueur
Categories: Beverages, Alcohol
Yield: 1 recipe
1 c  Brandy
3 dr Yellow food coloring
6 dr Red food coloring
2 dr Blue food coloring
1/2 ts Glycerin
1 c  Granulated sugar
3/4 c  Water
2    Dried apricot halves
1 tb Almond extract
1/2 c  Pure grain alcohol and
1/2 c  Water
Combine sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan.
Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and
simmer until all sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat
and cool.

In an aging container, combine apricot halves, almond
extract, grain alcohol with 1/2 cup water, and brandy.
Stir in cooled sugar syrup mixture. Cap and let age
for 2 days. Remove apricot halves. (Save apricot
halves, as they may be used for cooking). Add food
coloring and glycerin. Stir, recap and continue aging
for 1 to 2 months.

Re-bottle as desired. Liqueur is ready to serve but
will continue to improve with additional aging.

Variation: For a more prominent 'bitter almond'
flavor, add 4 apricot nuts,** split in half, to basic
mixture. Leave in for 2 days to 2 weeks depending upon
depth of flavor desired. Remove and discard apricot
nuts. Continue as directed.

**Note: Apricot 'nuts' come from within the apricot
pit. You may split pits yourself or obtain them dried
at a health food store.
