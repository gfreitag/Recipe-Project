Title: CRAB RANGOON II
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Wonton wrappers
1 ea Egg yolk beaten
4 c  Oil of your choice for deep
8 oz Cream cheese at room tempera
8 oz Crabmeat, flaked
1/4 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Worstershire sauce
Mix crabmeat, garlic powder and Worstershire sauce together in a bowl
and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Place one tsp. of mixture on wonton
wrapper, moisten edges with egg yolk and fold the wrapper in half to
form a triangle then seal edges. Fold the two furthermost points under
so you have something resembling a little bird.  You don't have to do
the last part but I do...it looks decorative. It should look something
like this:  Hope this looks OK on your screen:

In a wok heat the oil to 350 f.  Deep fry the wontons for 2-3 minutes
turning once until golden brown.  Enjoy!  They are delicious!
