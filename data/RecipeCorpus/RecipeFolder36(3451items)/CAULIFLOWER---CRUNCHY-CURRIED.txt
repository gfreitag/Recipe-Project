Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1 ts Salt
2    Medium-sized onions
2/3 tb Oil
1    Large cauliflower (about
2lb.3oz.cut into florets)
Juice of 1/2 lemon
2 tb Toasted sesame seeds
2 tb Toasted cumin seeds
2    Cloves garlic, finely ch.
1 1/2 ts Grated fresh root ginger
2 tb Roasted peanuts, finely ch.
1/2 ts Turmeric
1/4 ts Chilli powder
Toast the sesame seeds then the cumin seeds in a frypan, without any
added oil.  The sesame seeds are ready when they are golden brown,
and the cumin seeds when they pop, smell good, and have all heated
through, in 1-2 minutes if you start with a hot pan.  Grind the
toasted sesame and cumin seeds, separately or mixed.
Mix the toasted seeds, garlic, ginger and peanuts, adding the
:
turmeric, chilli powder, ground cloves and salt, and put aside.  Chop
the onions and put them in a large pot or pan to cook in the oil.
Cook until transparent and lightly coloured, taking care not to let
them burn.  Stir the spice mixture through the onion, then add the
cauliflower which has been broken and cut into florets, each the size
of a walnut.
Add the lemon juice and about 1/4 cup of water, cover, and
:
cook over a moderate heat , stirring and tossing the cauliflower
occasionally, until it is tender-crisp.  Add a little extra water
during cooking if necessary.  If you find that there is liquid left
when the cauliflower is cooked, thicken it with a little cornflour
paste and toss the cauliflower in it.  Taste and add extra salt if
necessary. Serve with dahl, rice, a tomato salad, cucumbers in
yoghurt and toasted coconut.
