Title: PEANUT STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST
Categories: Poultry, Microwave, Crockpot
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Mint, dried
1 pk G. Washington's Golden
-bouillon mix
12    Chicken breasts, boned
1/2 c  Peanut butter
1/8 c  Honey
1 ts Cumin
Bone chicken breasts if needed, keeping meat as nearly intact as
possible. (It's much easier to rip the meat off the bones than any
knifework I've tried to date.)  Pull off shreds and gobbets.
Put peanut butter, honey, cumin and mint in a bowl and mix well.
Microwaving for 30 seconds or so thins it and makes it much easier to
mix.
Spread about 2 tsp of the peanut butter mix in a thin layer over each
piece of breast meat.  Place 1/12 of the shreds and gobbets on the
breast and roll them up into a packet.  Tie the packet shut with
butcher's twine or fasten with a toothpick.
Arrange the twelve packets in layers in the crock pot, being careful
not to let any fall open.
Stir water in to the bowl with any remaining peanut butter and mix
well. Add the packet of bouillon and pour over the chicken packets.
Add water as needed to cover packets to a depth of at least one inch.
Turn crock pot on high for 5 or 6 hours.
Remove packets from pot and let drain on a platter.
All the chicken fat will have migrated to the top of the liquid,
which I suspect would probably make a wonderful flavoring for soups
and other dishes.
