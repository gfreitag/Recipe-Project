Title: Tom's Vegan Reduced Fat French Silk Pie
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
4    Bananas
Chocolate
16 oz Applesauce
1 c  Sugar
Blend the above mercilessly.  If you don't have a blender, melt the
chocolate and beat it in with the rest. Pour into pie crust of your
choice.  Makes enough for an 8 inch pie.
Refrigerate for at least 12 hours before eating.

Tom's Comments:  Naturally you can taste the difference, but it's good
enough that Michelle, who isn't vegan, proceeded directly to the
refrigerator for seconds without passing GO or collecting $200.

Lisa's Note: Tom's recipe doesn't specify sweetened or dark chocolate
or the amount needed.
