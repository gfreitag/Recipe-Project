Chop a slice from the bottom of each ear with a cleaver so that you
can remove the husks easily and stand the ears upright for cutting
off the kernels.  Remove husks and save.  Discard silk. Place cob
upright, cut end down, on a cutting board or wide soup plate and cut
kernels straight down with a sharp knife.  Puree kernels in a food
processor, grinder or blender to make a slightly chunky pulp. Tear
ends of husks slightly to help uncurl them.  In a shallow casserole,
overlap husks to make a solid layer of husks.  Seal top of dish with
aluminum foil.  Bake at 350 degrees for one hour.  Remove foil and
top layer of husks. Ladle sour cream in a mound in the center of the
dish and sprinkle with chili before spooning out portions.
