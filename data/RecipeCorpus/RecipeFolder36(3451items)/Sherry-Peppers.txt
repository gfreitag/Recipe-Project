Title: Sherry Peppers
Categories: Condiments, Caribbean
Yield: 1 bottle
1    Bottle sherry
(pref amontillado)
1/2 c  (to 1 cup) bird peppers
Or Scotch bonnets
Stem the peppers and wash thoroughly. If using bird peppers, leave
them whole. If using Scotch bonnets, cut each pepper lengthwise into
quarters.

Pour 1 cup sherry out of the bottle into a measuring cup. Place the
peppers in the bottle. Top up the bottle with the remaining sherry.
Tightly cap the bottle.

Let the sherry peppers steep for at least 2 weeks, preferably a month,
before serving. To use, sprinkle a few drops into soups, stews,
chowder, or any dish in need of a little fire.

Will keep indefinitely at room temperature.

Variation for Pepper Rum: Add 10 allspice berries, 2 whole cloves,
and 1 sprig of thyme. Prepare as for sherry peppers using 1 bottle
dark rum in place of the sherry.
