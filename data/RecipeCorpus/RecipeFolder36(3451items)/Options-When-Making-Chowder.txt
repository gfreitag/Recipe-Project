Title: Options When Making Chowder
Categories: Soup/stew, Information
Yield: 1 info file
Information only
1.  Substitute some of the water in the broth with a crisp white
wine, or add seasonings such as thyme, parsley, or sage.  Avoid bay
leaves, though. They don't seem to go well with chowder.  But don't
take my word for it...try it and see.

2.  Lobster scraps from a boiled lobster dinner can add depth to the
flavor.

3.  Plain milk can be substituted for the cream, or omitted
altogether.

4.  If your local market can supply one, try a broth made with a cod's
head.

5.  Even if the recipe doesn't call for it, celery is a welcome
addition to chowder.  Even a slice or two of lemon can add a little
zing.

6.  A dash of tobasco sauce never hurt the flavor of a chowder.
