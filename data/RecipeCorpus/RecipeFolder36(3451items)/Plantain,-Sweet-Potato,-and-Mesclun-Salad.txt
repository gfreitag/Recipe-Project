Title: Plantain, Sweet Potato, and Mesclun Salad
Categories: Salads, Potatoes, Caribbean
Yield: 4 servings
Washed and dried
6 tb Sauce Chien
(see pg 49)
Fresh ground black pepper
2    Orange sweet potatoes
(8-10 oz ea)
1    Ripe plantain
4 c  Mesclun (mixed baby greens)
Preheat the oven to 400 F.

Prick the sweet potatoes and plantain in a few spots with a fork.
Place the vegetables on a baking sheet and roast for 1 hour or until
tender. (Alternately, you can steam the vegetables until tender,
about 15 min.) Transfer the vegetables to a plate to cool. Peel the
sweet potatoes and plantain and cut each crosswise into  1/4-inch
slices.

Arrange the sweet potato and plantain slices in a circle around the
outer edge of four salad plates, overlapping sweet potato and
plantain to create a colorful border.

In a mixing bowl gently toss the mesclun with 3 tbs Sauce Chien.
Mound the mesclun in the center of each plate. Drizzle the remaining
sauce over the sweet potato and plantain. Sprinkle the salads with
freshly ground black p and serve at once.
