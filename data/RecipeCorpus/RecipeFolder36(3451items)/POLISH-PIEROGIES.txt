MMMMM-----------------------ACCOMPANIMENTS----------------------------
Vegan sour cream
Warm lecithin by placing the bottle in simmering water on the stove
till lecithin is runny.  Stir into the flours & salt & set aside.

Blend the vinegar, tofu & water till smooth.  Combine with the flours
handling till the dough has a medium stiff consistency.  Roll out
dough on a floured board forming a 21" x 6" rectangle 3/16" thick.
Cut into 8 equal pieces about 3" x 3" each.  (Rolling the dough a
littel thinner may yield another 3 pieces).  Place about 1 1/2 tb
filling on each piece.  Wet the edges of the dough.  Stretch one
corner of the dough to meet the opposite corner, forming a triangle &
press together, sealing the pierogi.

Bring water to a simmer in a large pot.  Drop each pierogi carefully
into the water & cook in the simmering water till the pierogi rises
to the surface.  Remove & drain.  They can be sealed in a plastic
wrap & kept in the fridge or frozen at this point.

To serve the pierogi, saute in oil until lightly browned.  Serve with
vegan sour cream.

POTATO FILLING: Cook potatoes till soft.  Drain & mash immediately
until they are smooth.  This should yield 4 c packed potatoes.  Add
yeast, salt & pepper & mix well.

Saute onions in oil till translucent.  Blend tofu till smooth.  Stir
onions & tofu into the potato mixture.  This filing should keep
refrigerated for a week.

CABBAGE GARBANZO FILLING: Heat oil in a large skillet.  Add cabbage,
onions & seasonings.  Cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add
water & flour & cook till thickened.  If necessary, add more flour a
tb at a time. This filling should keep in the fridge for a week.
