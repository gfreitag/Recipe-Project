Title: Oatmeal Shortbread
Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 16 servings
Unbleached
1 2/3 c  Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Ground Cinnamon
3/4 c  Unsalted Butter -- At Room
Temperature
1/2 c  Light Brown Sugar -- Packed
1 1/4 c  All-Purpose Flour,
1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment
paper.

2. Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar in a
mixing bowl until light and fluffy. In another bowl combine the
flour, 1 cup of oats, salt and cinnamon. Add to the butter mixture,
stirring with a wooden spoon just until combined.

3. Finely grind the remaining 2/3 cup of oats in a blender or food
processor. Dust a pastry cloth or other flat rolling surface with
some of the ground oats. Divide the shortbread dough in half. Roll
out each half into a circle about 8 inches in diameter and 3/8 inch
thick. Sprinkle the remaining oatmeal over the top of the dough and
press it into the surface with the rolling pin.

4. Using a sharp knife, cut each circle into 8 wedges. Prick each
wedge all over with the tines of a fork. Transfer to the prepared
baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, 18 to 20 mins. Cool on a wire
rack, then store in an airtight container up to 1 week.

Makes 16 cookies.
