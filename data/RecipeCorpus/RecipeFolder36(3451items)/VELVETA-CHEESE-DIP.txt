Cook minced garlic in cooking oil, push aside.  Cook onions until
soft and then add green pepper and banana peppers.  When banana
pepers start to soften, add tomatoes.  Cook until soft.  Then add
pimento, garlic, oil, and Velveta (cut into small pieces).  Cook over
very low heat until cheese is melted.

Serve warm with chips, crackers or tortillia chips.
