Tofu may be regular, firm or extra-firm and should be drained prior to

used instead of chili sauce.

drain 20 minutes while you prepare other ingredients.

sauce, honey, sesame oil and crushed red pepper; set aside.

heat (depending upon pan). Add tofu cubes and stir-fry until golden,
about 4 minutes. Transfer to plate using slotted spoon.
4. Add another TB oil to skillet and set over high heat. Chop or slice
mushrooms. Add mushrooms and red pepper to pan; stir-fry until
mushrooms are just tender. Add ginger, garlic and chili pepper;
stir-fry briefly. Remove to tofu platter.
5. Add broccoli florets to skillet and 1/4 cup chicken broth. Let
bubble until broccoli just turns bright green.
6. Whisk broth-cornstarch mixture and add to broccoli; bring to a
bubble. Dump in reserved tofu mixture and stir-fry, adding more
chicken broth if needed to coat evenlTaste and season with more
sesame oil, hot chili oil and/or dried red chili peppers.
