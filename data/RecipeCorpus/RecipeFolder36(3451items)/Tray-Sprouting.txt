Title: Tray Sprouting
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------METHOD AND INSTRUCTIONS-----------------------
Tray sprouting works best for seeds such as mung bean, chia, and
lettuce.

1. Rinse the seeds in lukewarm water.

2. Put the seeds in a jar, then add 3 times as much water as you have
sprouts. cover with a plastic mesh lid, cheesecloth or nylon net, then
fasten with a rubber band or canning jar screw band. Set aside and
soak for the time given in the recipe.

3. At the end of the soaking time, rinse the seeds and spread in a
tray. The tray can be a wooden box with a plastic, nylon, or wire
mesh bottom, or a perforated plastic tray.

4. Cover the tray with plastic wrap and then with newspaper or another
light blocking cover. Keep one end of the tray bottom propped up so
the sprouts can drain. Set the tray in a warm (70 degree F), dark
place.

5. Rinse and drain sprouts twice a day. In hot, dry weather, rinse
them 3 or 4 times a day. Rinse gently so the sprouts won't break,
under a faucet (not full force), the sprinkler attachment of your
sink, or by lowering the tray slightly into a sink of lukewarm water.
Cover the tray again after each rinsing.

6. On about the fourth day, move the tray of sprouts into sunlight so
chlorophyll can develop and turn the leaves green. Continue to rinse
and drain.

7. Move the sprouts from the tray to a strainer, and rinse well to
remove the hulls if desired. Hulls can shorten storage life of
spouts, but they also add flavor.

8. Use sprouts immediately in salads, sandwiches, or as the recipe
suggests. To store, put in plastic bags and refrigerate.

9. Wash and dry all equipment and put away for next use.
