Title: WINTER SQUASH AND FRUIT
Categories: Potatoes, Fruit, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Allspice
pn Grated lemon and orange
Peel
Nonstick cooking spray
(optional)
2 c  Peeled winter squash
1 lg Yam
1/2 c  Dried fruit
1    Apple
1    Pear
1    Banana
1/2 c  Cider
Cut vegetables and fruit into small pieces.  Mix with cider and
spices. Spray ovenproof container with nonstick cooking spray.  Put
vegetables and fruit into it and cover.  Bake in 350 degree oven for
45 minutes. Remove cover and add more cider if necessary.  You need
enough liquid to keep it from burning, but not too much.  Bake for at
least 45 minutes more. The longer you bake it, the more the flavors
blend.  I baked it for 1 1/2 hours more at 325 degrees.

This comes out so sweet it could be either an accompaniment for a
meal or a dessert.

This is a slight modification of a recipe I found in a Blue Cross
magazine.
