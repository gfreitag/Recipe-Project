Title: Kidney Beans
Categories: Vegetables, Information
Yield: 2 1/4 cups
1    Sprig thyme
2    Garlic clove(s)
Peeled and minced
1/2 ts Pepper
1 ts Salt
1 c  Dried kidney beans
6 c  Chicken or vegetable stock
1 lg Yellow onion(s), peeled
Finely chopped
1 ts Olive oil
1 md Bay leaf
Place beans in colander, rinse, and pick over them. Put beans in large
stockpot, cover with cold water, and soak for at least 3 hours, or
overnight.

Drain beans and return to stockpot. Add the remaining ingredients to
the pot and cook gently, uncovered, over medium-low heat until the
beans are tender, 45 min to 1 hour, skimming the surface occasionally
to remove any scum that rises to the surface. If necessary, drain the
beans to get rid of excess liquid. Discard the bay leaf and serve or
save for use in any recipe that calls for cooked kidney beans
