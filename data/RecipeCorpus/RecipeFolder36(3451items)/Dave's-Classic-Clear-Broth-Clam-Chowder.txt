Title: Dave's Classic Clear-Broth Clam Chowder
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Soup/stew
Yield: 1 pot
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Savory
1 tb Flour
1 tb Butter
12    Quahog clams; scrubbed
4 sl Salt pork; diced
2 qt Water or stock
1 c  Carrots; diced
1 c  Onion; coarsely chopped
1 c  Celery; diced
4 c  Potatoes; pared & cubed
Scrub the quahogs well with a stiff brush to remove external sand.
(Don't worry too much about sand inside; quahogs are notoriously
tight clams and don't pick up a lot of grit.)  Steam the clams in
about a cup of water (or half a cup of water and half a cup of dry
white wine) until they open. Discard any that remain closed.  Drain,
reserving the broth.  Remove the clams from the shells, dice the meat
coarsely, and set them aside in a bowl with the broth poured over
them.

In a heavy stockpot, fry out salt pork until crisp.  Add carrots,
onion, and celery and sautee gently just until the onion is
transparent and amber.  Add the water or stock and bring to a boil,
then add potatoes, salt, and pepper.  Simmer for ten minutes, then
add herbs, flour, and butter.  Bring back to a boil and stir in clams
and clam broth.  Simmer for a few minutes and serve.
