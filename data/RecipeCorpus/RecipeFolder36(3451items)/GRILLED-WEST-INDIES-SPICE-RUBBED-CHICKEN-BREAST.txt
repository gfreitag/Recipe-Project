Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM-------------------------SPICE RUB------------------------------
MMMMM--------------------------CHICKEN-------------------------------
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 tb Soft butter
2 tb Molasses
Lime halves for garnish
4    Boneless chicken breasts,
Skin on
4    Firm bananas, skin on
And halved lengthwise
3 Tbs. curry powder
2 Tbs. paprika
1 Tbs. cayenne pepper
2 Tbs. freshly cracked black pepper
3 Tbs. ground cumin
2 Tbs. powdered ginger
2 Tbs. salt
Mix all the spices together well.  Rub this mixture over both sides of
each chicken breast, cover, and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Over a medium fire, grill the chicken breasts skin side down for 7
to 8 minutes, until well browned and heavily crusted.  Turn them and
grill an additional 10 minutes.  Check for doneness by nicking the
largest breast at the fattest point:  The meat should be fully opaque
with no trace of red.  Remove the chicken from the grill.
Rub the banana halves with vegetable oil and place them on the grill
flat side down.  Grill them for about 2 minutes, or until the flat
sides are slightly golden in color.  Flip them and grill for an
additional 2 minutes.
Remove the banana halves from the grill.  Mix the butter and
molasses together and paint this over the bananas.  Serve the chicken
breasts and the banana halves together, sprinkled with a little lime
juice. From "The Thrill of the Grill"
