RULES FOR BAKING A BEAUTIFUL CHEESECAKE
=================================================

1. Beat cheese and sugar together until very smooth and fluffy and the
sugar is completely dissolved.

2. Beat in eggs 1 at a time just long enough to thoroughly blend. DO
NOT OVER BEAT.

3. To avoid cracking on the top of the cheesecake: Place a pan of hot
water on the floor of the oven during baking time.

Check that your oven is NOT drafty.

Check the accuracy of your oven temperature. A too-hot oven WILL cause
cracks.

DO NOT "peek" at the cheesecake during baking time.

Use the proper size pan. If you use another size pan, adjust the
baking time accordingly.

DO NOT over bake. Baking time IS important.

Run a spatula around the sides of the pan to loosen cheesecake
immediately after baking.

Cool the baked cheesecake to room temperature COMPLETELY before
refrigerating. A hot, or even warm cheesecake, in the refrigerator
WILL definitely crack.

4. Even the non-amateur, following all the rules, will occasionally
produce a cracked cheesecake. If so, simply cover the top of the
cheesecake with one of your favorite toppings and pretend you didn't
notice. The cheesecake will taste wonderful just the same. (I think
that's why so many cheesecakes have toppings anyway!)
