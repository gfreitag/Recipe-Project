Chop 2 of the onions and set aside.  Chop remaining onion fine.  Salt
a large skillet.  Turn heat to medium and add meat, finely chopped
onion, and garlic.  Break up meat with fork and cook until it is
browned. Drain fat.

Add barbeque sauce and water.  Bring to a boil.  Add remaining
seasonings.

Cover and simmer over very low heat 30 minutes, stirring and tasting
occasionally, adding tomato juice if mixture is getting too dry.
Chili is best when allowed to age overnight in refrigerator and
reheated.

To construct the plate of 5-way chili, layer spaghetti on a plate (a
small oval plate is traditional), top it with hot chili, then with a
sparse layer of beans, then chopped onions.  Pat on plenty of cheese
while chili is still hot and serve immediately, with oyster crackers
on the side.  Serves 4.
