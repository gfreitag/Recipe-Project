Title: Creme Brulee
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
3    Egg yolks
1 ts Vanilla extract
3/4 c  Light brown sugar
2 1/3 c  Heavy cream
2/3 c  Milk
1/4 c  Granulated sugar
3    Whole Eggs
Preheat oven to 300F.
Heat cream, milk and sugar in a heavy saucepan to almost boiling. In a
separate bowl beat whole eggs and extra egg yolks together well.
Gradually whisk the heated mixture into the eggs, then return mixture
to saucepan. Cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly with a
wooden spoon, until the custard coats the back of the spoon (3-4
min); remove from heat.  Stir in vanilla.

Pour custard into 6 individual custard dishes or into 1 shallow baking
dish about 9" across.  Set dish or dishes in a large pan and place on
the middle rack of oven.  Pour hot water into the outer pan to come
level with custard.  Bake for 35-45 minutes, until center of custard
is set. When done, remove custard from water bath and cool.  Cover
and chill.

A few hours before serving, preheat broiler.  Sift brown sugar evenly
over top of custard, spreading to the edges.  Set custard under
broiler as close to heat as possible.  Broil until browned but not
burned, about 1 1/2 min.  Watch closely.  Remove and chill.

6 servings.
