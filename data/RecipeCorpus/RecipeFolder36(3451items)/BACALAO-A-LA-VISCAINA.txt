-about 2 lbs, or two 14.4oz
-cans of tomatoes, diced
1/4 lb Ham; chopped
MikeNote; Salt Cod, soak for 24 hours and Gently rinse, to remove
most but not all of the salt. Do not break up fish.
Put the potatoes in a large pan of cold, salted water, cutting any
large potatoes in half or quarters first. Bring the water to a boil
and simmer until the potatoes are just tender when pierced with a
fork, 15-20 minutes. Drain and when cool enough to handle,, peel away
the skin. Set aside. In a heavy pan such as a Dutch oven, heat the
olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions, reduce the heat to very
low and slowly saute about one hour. Stir occasionally, watching that
the onion doesn't burn. A few dribbles more of oil may be necessary.
Pre-heat oven to 300F degrees. Turn up the heat, add the garlic and
tomato and cook, stirring constantly until the mixture becomes thick
and the liquid is substantially reduced, about 10-15 minutes. Add the
ham, parsley, pepper, cinnamon and cloves, then gently stir the cod,
potatoes, jalapenos and their juice into the tomato mixture.
Transfer to a 1 to 2 quart casserole, preferably clay, sprinkle with
the olives and bake for 30 minutes. Bacalao a la Viscaina can be made
ahead and re-heated in a 300F oven for 20 minutes or until thoroughly
hot.
