Categories: Kooknet, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 20 crab cakes
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
2 lg Egg yolks
2 lb Jumbo lump crab meat
1/4 c  Unsalted butter, softened
5 c  Cornflakes
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
2 tb Dijon mustard
2 ts Old Bay Seasoning
In a food processor, pulse cornflakes until ground coarse and spread
in a shallow baking pan.

In a large bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, mustard, Old Bay
seasoning, cayenne and yolks and add crab meat and salt and pepper to
taste, tossing mixture gently but thoroughly.

With a 1/4 cup measure, form crab miguel into slightly flattened
rounds about 2 1/2 inches wide and 3/4 inch thick and gently coat
crab cakes with cornflakes, transferring as coated to a
wax-paper-lined baking sheet. Chill crab cakes, covered with plastic
wrap, at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours.

Preheat oven to 400F.

Transfer crab cakes to a large baking sheet. Put about 1/2 teaspoon
butter on each crab cake and bake in the middle of the oven until
crisp and cooked through, about 15 minutes.

Serve with tartar sauce.
