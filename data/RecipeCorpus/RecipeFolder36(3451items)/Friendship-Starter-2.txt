Title: Friendship Starter 2
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Flour
1 c  Milk
1 c  Sugar
Mix together and let sit on counter.  Stir every day until it has sat
for at least 3 to 4 days. You will know it is ready when it keeps
popping the plastic lid off itself, or tends to become really sticky
when you stir it. You can then proceed with any of the friendship
cake instructions using your own starter. Just start with the day one
instructions and continue to add the sugar, flour, etc. Have fun.
Don't feel bad about throwing extra starter away now that you can
create your own whenever you want. From: Sharon Stevens 8/92
