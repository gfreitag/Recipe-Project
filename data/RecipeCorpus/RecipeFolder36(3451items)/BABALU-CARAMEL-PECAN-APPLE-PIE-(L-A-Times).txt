Apple of Babalu's Eye DEAR SOS: Babalu Restaurant in Santa Monica
serves a fabulous caramel pecan apple pie, and I would love to have
the recipe. The double-crust deep-dish pie uses either Granny Smith
or Golden Delicious apples. The top crust has a thick layer of
caramel topping with pecan halves covering the entire top.--MARCIA

DEAR MARCIA: With a description like that, I'm salivating already.

PIE CRUST

Combine flour, sugar and salt. Cut in cold butter. Work dough with
fingers or cutter to form coarse crumbs. Add ice water and mix
lightly until stiff dough is formed. Refrigerate to chill dough.
Divide dough in half. Roll out bottom crust and place over greased
9-inch pie pan, allowing edges to hang over slightly from rim. Roll
out top crust and refrigerate until ready to use.

CARAMEL TOPPING

Combine sugar and corn syrup in saucepan. Stir constantly over high
heat until mixture dissolves and turns rich caramel color. Remove
from heat and slowly stir in whipping cream and butter until smooth.

FILLING

Combine lemon juice, apples, flour, sugar and cinnamon in bowl. Mound
filling over prepared bottom crust. Dot with butter. Top with rolled
top crust. Trim edges and fold under and crimp. Cut few slashes in
top crust for ventilation. Bake at 325 degrees until crust is golden
brown, 1 1/2 hours. Pour Caramel Topping over crust and cover with
pecans. Place pie on foil-lined tray. Return to oven to toast nuts 10
minutes.
Makes 8 servings.
