Title: Crisp Peppernuts
Categories: Cake/cookie, Herbs/spice
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Syrup
1 ts Cardamon
2 ts Soda
1/2 ts Pepper (white)
3 3/4 c  Flour
1 ts Cinnamon
1 c  Butter
1 ts Ginger
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Cloves
2    Eggs
1/2    To 1 tsp oil of anise or
-ground anise
Cream shortening and sugar.  Add eggs one at a time beating well.
Add syrup. Sift dry ingredients with spices and flour.  Add half the
amount of flour; mixing well.  Add remaining flour.  Store
dough in tightly covered container in refrigerator
overnight or longer.  This helps dough to season and spices
to blend.  Roll dough into thin ropes and freeze.  Slice
with a sharp knife 1/4 inch or so. (Should be about the
size of a dime or nickel)  Place pieces separately on
greased baking sheet.  Bake in 375 F oven for appriximately
7 minutes.
Hint:  Roll your ropes of dough in separate shets of waxed
paper.  They won't stick together and are easy to handle.

This is another good Mennonite recipe from Annie Epp, Langham, SK.
