-not just peel)
4 c  Flour (scant), sifted with:
1 ts Salt -- and
3 ts Baking powder
1 1/4 c  Melted shortening
1 c  Sugar
3    Eggs -- beaten
1    Grated lemon (whole
MMMMM------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
1 c  Raisins
1    Orange or 1/2 lemon
1 c  Nuts
Shake of cinnamon
(fills 1/2 of dough recipe)
2 lb Partly cooked pitted prunes
5 tb Or 6 Tb Jelly (whatever kind
-you have on hand)
Combine the dough ingredients to form dough. Grind the filling
ingredients together with a food grinder.

Roll out the dough and cut circles with a glass. Put a spoonful of
filling in the center of each circle, and fold up sides of the dough
to form triangular filled cookies.
Bake at 400 F until lightly browned.

I haven't actually made this recipe, but I've been enjoying the
hamentaschen for years.

For poppyseed filling, I think I'd just use the solo filling from the
can. I've made my own hamentaschen using various jams for filling,
with some success. Good luck.
