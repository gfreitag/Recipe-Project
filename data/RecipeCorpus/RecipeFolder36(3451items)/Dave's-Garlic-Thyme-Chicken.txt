For optimum flavor, prepare chicken pieces several hours in advance.
Rub oil well into chicken breasts with your fingers.  Then rub in the
garlic, chopped lemon thyme, oregano and freshly ground pepper.

Place prepared chicken in heavy skillet.  Add water; cover and cook
over low heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning once, until chicken is
browned on outside and no longer pink in the center.  Serve
immediately. Good with fluffy rice, to catch the herb-scented juices.
