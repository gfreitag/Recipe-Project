Title: Cocoa Fudge
Categories: Candies, Holiday
Yield: 49 servings
-liquid cream substitute
1/4 c  Butter
1 ts Vanilla
2/3 c  Cocoa
3 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Heavy cream or non-dairy
A good basic chocolate fudge. The use of whipping cream or non-dairy
cream substitute makes stirring unnecessary. This makes a very creamy
fudge.

Combine coicoa, sugar, salt, and heavy cream in a large saucepan.
Bring to a rolling boil; then reduce heat to medium and cook to 234
degrees F. without stirring. Remove from heat and add butter and
vanilla. Do not stir. Cool to lukewarm (about 110 degreees F.). Beat
by hand or with mixer until fudge thickens and loses some of its
gloss. Quickly spread fudge in lightly buttered 8-inch square pan.
When cool, cut into squares. Makes about 49 pieces.
