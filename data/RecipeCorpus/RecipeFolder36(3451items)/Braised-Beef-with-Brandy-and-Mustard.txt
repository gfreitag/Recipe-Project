Title: Braised Beef with Brandy and Mustard
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
4    Sun-dried tomatoes
(not oil-packed)
Cut into slivers
3 lg Garlic clove(s)
Peeled, thinly sliced
6    Juniper berries
1    Bay leaf
Black pepper to taste
1 tb Olive oil
1 1/4 lb Bottom round steak
Trimmed of fat and membrane
1/2 c  Brandy
2 c  Beef stock
2 tb Coarse-grained mustard
2 tb Dijon mustard
4    Shallots, peeled
Thinly sliced
Preheat oven to 325 F.

In a Dutch oven or deep skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add meat
and brown on all sides. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels
and drain off all the pat in the pan. Return the pan to the heat and
immediately add brandy, stirring to scrape up any browned bits in the
bottom. Cook until the brandy is reduced to a syrupy glaze. Stir in
stock, mustards, shallots, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, juniper
berries, and bay leaf and bring to a boil. Return the meat to the
pan, cover tightly and place in the oven. Bake, turning the meat
every 30 min, for 1 1/2-2 hours, or until very tender. Remove bay
leaf and season the sauce with pepper. Cut the meat into thin slices,
arrange on a platter, and spoon the sauce over.
