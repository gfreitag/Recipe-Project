Title: VOLCANO
Categories: Kids, Kooknet
Yield: 6 servings
Food coloring -- red
1 ts Vinegar
Clay -- modeling
1 ts Baking soda
My favorite kiddy project is the classic baking soda and vinegar
volcano. Make a volcano out of play doh or modeling clay. In the
crater put baking soda and perhaps a little red food coloring. To
display, pour vinegar in it and watch it erupt!
