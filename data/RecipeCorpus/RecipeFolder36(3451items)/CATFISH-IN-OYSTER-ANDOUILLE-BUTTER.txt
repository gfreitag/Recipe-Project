Title: CATFISH IN OYSTER ANDOUILLE BUTTER
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Chopped green onions
24 ea Fresh shucked oysters
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1 1/2 c  Heavy whipping cream
Salt and white pepper to
Taste
4 sl Cold butter
6 ea 5-8 oz catfish fillets
3/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 c  Eggwash (1 egg, 1/2 cup
Water, 1/2 cup milk)
1/2 c  Unseasoned flour
1/4 c  Julienned andouille sausage
1 ts Garlic
1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms
In a ten inch heavy bottom saute pan, heat oil over medium high heat.
Blend eggwash to ensure that egg, milk and water are well mixed. Dip
catfish fillets into eggwash and then into flour, coating evenly on
all sides. Saute fish, three fillets at a time, until golden brown,
approximately three to five minutes on each side. Once cooked, remove
and keep warm. In the same saute pan, add andouille, garlic,
mushrooms and green onions and saute until vegetables are wilted,
approximately three to five minutes. Add oysters and saute until
their edges are curly. Deglaze with white wine, add heavy whipping
cream and cook until sauce is slightly thickened. Season to taste
using salt and white pepper. Once sauce has thickened, swirl in
butter chips, two at a time, until all is incorporated. The butter
will finish the sauce to a nice sheen. Place two to three ounces of
oyster butter in the center of a serving plate and top with catfish
fillet. Garnish with four cooked oysters per serving.
