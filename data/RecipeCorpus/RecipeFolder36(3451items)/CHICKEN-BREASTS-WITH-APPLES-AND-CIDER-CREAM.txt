In a 2 quart saucepan, reduce the cider to 1/2 cup.  Whisk in mustard,

heat or until the sauce thickens.  Add the seasoning, set aside to
cool and pour into a wide mouth jar.
Dredge chicken in combined flour/salt/pepper.  Heat 3 T oil in a large
skillet.  Add chicken and saute on one side for about 5 minutes. Turn
and saute for 3-5 minutes more or until just slightly undone.
Meanwhile, core and slice apples into 1/4" slices.  Remove chicken;
keep warm. Add remaining 1 T oil to pan.  Add apple slices and saute
for 3-5 minutes or until just tender.  Remove apples.  Add cider
cream sauce to pan and heat while scraping up any little browned bits
from the pan bottom.  Return chicken to warm sauce for one minute,
then top with apple rings and sauce. Heat for one minute and serve.
Can be held in slack oven or very low heat for about 10-15 minutes.
