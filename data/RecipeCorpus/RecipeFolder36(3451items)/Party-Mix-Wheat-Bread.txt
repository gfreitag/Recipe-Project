Title: Party Mix Wheat Bread
Categories: Breadmaker
Yield: 2 servings
2 tb Oil
3 tb Molasses
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 1/8 c  Water; hot tap
1/2 tb Yeast
3 c  Whole wheat flour
1 1/2 ts Seasoned salt
2 tb Powdered milk
Pile everything into the machine in the order listed. Select the
bread cycle.  Remove at the end of the cooling cycle.  The
flavors of the seasonings are most pronounced when the bread is
allowed to cool completely.

Variations:

HIGH-SPEED PARTY MIX WHEAT BREAD  (Hitachi and Regal machines)

Use 2 t active dry yeast and select the "BREAD RAPID" setting.

PARTY MIX WHITE BREAD

Substitute sugar for the molasses and bread flour for the whole
wheat flour.  If you object to the strange tint that the
Worcestershire sauce will give the dough, use Lea & Perrin's
White Wine Worcestershire sauce. Hitachi and Regal owners who
want to use the "BREAD RAPID" cycle can use 2 t of active dry
yeast.

Sylvia's comments: With WW flour, this barely rose and then cratered.
With all bread flour, it mushroomed.  I hoped this would taste like
Chex Party Mix; it just tasted like bread.  Looked like WW because of
the Worcestershire but still tasted white.
