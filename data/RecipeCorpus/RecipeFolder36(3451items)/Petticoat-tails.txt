Title: Petticoat tails
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
50 g  Granulated sugar (2 oz)
4 tb Milk
350 g  Plain flour (12 oz)
170 g  Butter (6 oz)
Sift the flour into a bowl and stir in the sugar. Gently heat the
butter and milk together and as soon as the butter has melted stir
the liquid into the flour to make a soft but not sticky dough.

Turn it onto a floured surface and kneat it lightly. Divide the dough
in half then roll the halves out directly onto a baking tray into
9-inch rounds using a large plate as a guide. Flute the edges.

Cut out a 2-inch circle from the centre but leave it in place. Divide
the outer ring into eight, keeping the inner circle whole. Sprinkle
with granulated sugar and bake at 180 oC (350 oF) for about 30
minutes or until golden brown and crisp.
