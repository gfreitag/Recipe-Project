MMMMM-----------------------ELECTRIC BREAD----------------------------
1/2 c  Creamed corn
3 tb Green chilies; (canned; dice
1 1/2 ts Jalapeno peppers; (canned; d
3 ts Olive oil
1 c  Water
3 ts Yeast
3 c  Bread flour
3 ts Sugar
3/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Cilatro, dried
1 c  Corn meal
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 11 o'clock.  Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Tested in DAK R2D2.  Sylvia's comments:  I used MM to re-size the 1 lb
loaf to 1-1/2 lb, changed the yeast, sugar, and salt amounts to what
works in my ABM, and it came out perfect first time!  I also subbed
thawed frozen corn for the creamed corn, I HATE the stuff and won't
have it in the house, and skipped the jalapeno.  After I added the
water, I thought it needed just a hair more but added a tb of the
juice from the green chiles rather than water.  I wish I'd replaced
more water with chile juice, the bread wasn't spicy at all.

Pam's notes:  I'm putting the ingreds for what they call a "regular
loaf" because the "large loaf" could've been used for special effects
for a volcanic eruption. My sister and I are drooling over the idea
of serving this with chili at a football party this fall. Would also
be great cut into triangles (which is how I cut my bread when I don't
want to plop a big square slice >>> down for somebody); toasted, then
run under the broiler with cheddar cheese on it. YUMMM. Make sure to
drain chilies and peppers well; don't get juice in eyes; I didn't
bother to chop since they were decimated by the kneading anyway...
