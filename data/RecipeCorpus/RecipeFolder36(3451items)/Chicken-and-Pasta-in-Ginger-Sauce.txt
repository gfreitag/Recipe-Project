MMMMM-------------------------THE SAUCE------------------------------
2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Rice vinegar
1/4 c  White cooking wine
2 ts Honey
Olive oil
1 ts Garlic powder
3 ts Ground ginger
1/8 ts Crushed rep pepper flakes
1 ts Dried thyme
2 ts Lime juice
3 ts Dijon mustard
Combine the sauce ingredients, and set aside.

Put the leek and pepper in a large skillet with a little bit of olive
oil. Saute for about 3 minutes, just until the vegetables begin to
wilt. Remove vegetables from the skillet and set aside.  Add chicken
to the skillet (and more olive oil, if necessary), and cook in the
vegetable juices until no longer pink.  Add the sauce to the skillet.
Bring to a boil, and simmer on low heat for about 5 minutes.  Prick
the chicken with a fork, to let the juices seep in.  Add the
vegetables back into the skillet and cook for an additional 5
minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.

While the chicken is simmering, bring a large pot of water to a boil
over high heat.   Dissolve the bouillon cube in the water. Add the
spaghetti, and cook to desired doneness.

Transfer the pasta to a serving bowl. Arrange the chicken and
vegetables and sauce on top, and enjoy!
