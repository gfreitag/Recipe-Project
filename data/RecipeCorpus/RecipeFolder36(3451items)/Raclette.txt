A Swiss cheese delicacy.  There is some confusion over whether
raclette refers to a specific type of cheese or to the dish itself.
(At this writing, I'm not too sure myself).

Light a good fire.  Buy yourself a half wheel of real Raclette
cheese, preferably from the Valais, between three and five months
old.  Scrape off the rind, top and bottom, so that the cheese can
melt more easily. Prepare boiled potatoes in their skins and have  a
ready supply of gherkins or cornichons, pickled onions and black
pepper.  When the fire dies to a mass of glowing embers, procure
yourself a large flat stone and put it before the fire.  Set the half
cheese on top, its cut surface exposed to the heat.  Nearby have a
supply of plates.  As the cheese melts, scrape it off on to a plate
and serve it at once.
