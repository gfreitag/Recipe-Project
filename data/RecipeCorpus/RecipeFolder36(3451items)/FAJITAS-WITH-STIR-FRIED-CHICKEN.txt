TIME-SAVERS:
MICROWAVE TIP: Just before serving, stack the tortillas and wrap them
in a damp paper towel. Cook at 100% for 1 minute.
DO-AHEAD: Since the fajitas are fine served at room temperature, much
of the preparation can be done ahead of time. The sauce (Step 5) can
be made and the chicken marinated in advance. Just be sure to cook the
chicken and warm the tortillas as close to serving time as possible.
