This recipe takes two days. On the first day, prepare the meat and
marinate. On the second day, prepare the veggies and cook.
Place meat in a bowl. In a small bowl, combine black pepper, garlic
and oregano and sprinkle mixture over meat. Mix well to coat.
In a blender, combine lemon juice and olive oil and blend. Pour over
meat, cover and refrigerate overnight.
The next day, brush onions and green pepper with olive oil and
sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Thread meat and veggies,
alternating, on to skewers. Barbecue on grill, being careful not to
overcook. Use remaining marinate to bush on while cooking. Before
serving, sprinkle with salt and fresh lemon juice.
