Categories: Soup/stew, Appetizers, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Almond paste
Grated zest of 1 orange
1 c  Evaporated skim milk
Salt and white pepper
1 1/4 c  Slivered toasted almonds
Grated orange zest
2 qt Chicken or vegetable stock
1/3 c  Long-grain rice
1/2 c  Blanched almonds
1 tb Butter
1    Large onion, chopped
1 tb Finely chopped garlic
1/4 c  Dry Sherry
1.  Spray a large soup pot with Pam.  Add the stock and bring to a
boil. Turn down the heat to medium-low, and add the rice and blanced
almonds. Cover and let cook slowly for 30 minutes.
2.  Meanwhile, spray a 10-inch skillet with Pam, and in it melt the
butter over medium heat.  Add the onion, and saute until it starts to
soften, about 3 1/2 minutes.  Lower the heat slightly, and add the
garlic. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, to soften the garlic
for about 20 seconds.  Stir in the sherry, then crumble in the almond
paste a bit at a time.  Remove the skillet from the heat, and whisk
well to smooth it out.
3.  Lower the heat under the stock to the barest possible simmer.
Add the onion mixture, the orange zest, and evaporated skim milk.
Let cook to blend flavors, 10 minutes more.
4.  Puree the soup, in batches, in a food processor, then put through
a food-mill or power strainer.  Season to taste with salt and white
pepper.
5.  Reheat just before serving, and serve, very hot, in small cups.
Garnish soup with toasted almonds and the merest bit of orange zest.
