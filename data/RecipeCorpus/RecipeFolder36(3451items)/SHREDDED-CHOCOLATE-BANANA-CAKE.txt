Categories: Cake/cookie, Chocolate
Yield: 1 cake
1/4 c  Half-and-half
2 ts Vanilla extract
6 tb Unsalted butter, room temp.
2 tb Shortening
1 c  Sugar
2    Eggs, room temp.
Confectioner's sugar(option)
2 c  All purpose flour, unsifted
1 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
3/4 c  Bittersweet chocolate,
-grated
3    Bananas, fully ripe
Butter or spray with non-stick cooking spray a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan;
set aside.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt onto a sheet of wax
paper. Place the grated chocolate in a bowl and stir 1 ts of the
sifted mixture; set aside.  Mash bananas in a bowl and stir in
half-and-half and vanilla; set aside.
In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream butter and shortening on
moderate speed for 3 to 4 minutes.  Raise speed to moderately high,
add half of sugar and beat for 1 minute; add remaining sugar and beat
1 minute longer, scraping down sides and bottom of the bowl.  Add the
eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Blend in
banana mixture on low speed. On low speed, blend in flour mixture in
2 additions, beating just until particles of flour have been
absorbed. Stir in chocolate by hand.
Pour and scrape the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake for 1 hour or
slightly longer - until risen, golden brown on top, and a wooden pick
inserted in center comes out clean and dry.
Cool on a rack for 3 to 4 minutes.  Carefully invert onto a second
rack, remove pan and invert the cake again to cool right side up. Sift
confectioner's sugar on the top.
