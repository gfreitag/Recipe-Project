ginger, garlic and sherry. Marinate steak over night in the
refrigerator. Dry meat on paper towels. In a wok, heat peanut oil and
saute chopped garlic until it turns golden brown. Remove, leaving at

Make a slurry of the cornstarch and a little water. Pour marinade

green pepper and
water chestnuts in the wok. Add meat and marinade sauce. Add a dash
sesame oil
to taste. Serve over steamed rice.
