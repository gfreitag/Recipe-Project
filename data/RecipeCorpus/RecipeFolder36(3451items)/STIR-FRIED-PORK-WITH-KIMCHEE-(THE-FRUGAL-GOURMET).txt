This dish is so simple that you'll suspect I've made a mistake. No, I
haven't. Once you get the pickles prepared, you're in for some very
profound but uncomplicated Korean cooking.
Heat a wok, add the oil, and chow(stir-fry) the pork for a couple of
minutes, adding salt and pepper. Add the scallions and toss a bit.
Add the Napa Kimchee, garlic, and red pepper. Chow (stir-fry) for a
couple of minutes until all is hot. Remove to a plate and sprinkle
with toasted sesame seeds.
Note: Be careful with the salt because the Napa Kimchee is already
salty.
