Categories: Breadmaker, Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/4 c  Water
1 ts Lemon juice
1 1/2 ts Yeast
2 1/2 c  Bread flour
1/2 c  Whole-wheat flour
Add all ingredients and select dough and first rise setting.  Remove
dough and press dough.  Let rest for 5 minutes before hand shaping.
If using baking stones place on the lower rack of a cold oven.  If
using a 13 x 9 baking pan, dust with flour.  Lightly sprinkle work
surface with flour. Shape dough into a ball.  If sticky, sprinkle
lightly with flour.  Cut in half.  Using both hands, stretch ball of
dough out and down.  Gather the ends to the bottom center and pinch
together to form a plump, round ball. Repeat this process a couple of
times, or until the dough forms into a smooth, tight loaf.  Gently
pinch together the bottom ends.  You should now have a perfectly
round, smooth ball of dough.  Carefully place the loaf on a well
floured baker's peel or the prepared baking pan.  With a very sharp
paring knife, cut the top of the loaf with a large X, approximately
1/4" deep.  Cover with a clean kitchen cloth.  Let rise until doubled
in size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Repeat with the remaining dough.
Preheat oven to 425.  When loaf has doubled in size, sprinkle it
generously with flour and place in preheated oven.  bake for about 30
minutes or until brown in color.  Remove from oven and cool on wire
rack.
