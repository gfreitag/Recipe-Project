Title: Chicken Jambalaya
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Cajun/creol
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Dried basil or thyme
1/2 ts Garlic salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Bottled hot pepper sauce
1    Bay leaf
2 c  Cubed cooked chicken or
-turkey
1/3 c  Chopped celery
1/4 c  Chopped onion
1/4 c  Chopped green pepper
2 tb Margarine or butter
14 1/2 oz Can tomatoes; cut up
1 1/2 c  Chicken broth
2/3 c  Long grain rice
I cheat and use 1 1/2 c water and 1 1/2 teaspoons of chicken bouillon
instead of broth.  The recipe calls for 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of hot
pepper sauce, but my husband is a "the hotter the better" man, so I
use the max amount.  :)  I also usually leave out the green pepper,
but that's just personal preference.  I usually end up doubling this
recipe--it's absolutely fantastic with garlic bread!

In a large skillet cook celery, onion and green pepper in margarine or
butter till vegetables are tender.  Stir in the undrained tomatoes,
chicken broth, rice, basil or thyme, garlic salt, pepper, hot pepper
sauce, and bay leaf.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat.  Cover and
simmer about 20 minutes or till rice is tender.  Stir in chicken;
cook till heated through. Discard bay leaf.
