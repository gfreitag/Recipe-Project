Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday, Nuts/grains
Yield: 12 pounds
1 lb Citron or chopped candied
-lemon and orange peel
1 lb Pecan meats [optional]
1 lb Chopped dates or
-figs [optional]
1 lb Brown sugar [2 2/3 c packed]
15    Egg yolks, beaten
1/2 c  Liquor or fruit juice*
15    Egg whites
4 c  All purpose flour
1 tb Cinnamon
1 tb Cloves
1 tb Allspice
1 tb Nutmeg
1/2 tb Mace
1 ts Salt
2 1/2 lb Currants
2 1/2 lb Raisins
* Use 1/4 cup bourbon, dark rum or brandy with 1/4 cup wine or 1/2 cup
prune, apricot or grape juice.

See "About Butter Cakes" and "About Fruit Cakes" for tips.

Pre-heat oven to 275. Have all ingredients at about 75 deg. Sift the
flour before measuring. Reserve one cup and re-sift the three cups
with the spices and salt.

Wash the currants; cut up the raisins, dates and figs with scissors;
and coarsely break the pecan meats. [I prefer dates, figs or more
raisins to the traditional nuts- JW]  Sprinkle these ingredients with
the one cup of flour.

Cream the butter until soft. Sift the brown sugar and add gradually,
mixing after each addition. Beat in the beaten egg yolks in 3
batches. Add the flour mixture in thirds alternating with the liquor
or fruit juice. Fold in the floured fruit and nuts. Beat the egg
whites until stiff but not dry and fold into the batter.

Prepare 2 4 1/2"x 8 " loaf pans AND 2 9" tube pans and bake at 275
for 3 to 4 hr. If 2 large 5 lb pans are used allow 5 hr. Place a
shallow pan of water in the oven. Remove it for the last hour of
baking. Cool and store.
