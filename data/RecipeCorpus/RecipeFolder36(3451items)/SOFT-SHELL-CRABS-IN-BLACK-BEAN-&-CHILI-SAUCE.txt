When you buy soft shell crabs, be sure they are still alive.
Usually they look quite dead, weak and limp. Touch their legs, eyes,
or mouth. Even if they respond only slightly and slowly, they are
still alive. Refrigerate them as soon as you get home.
Cleaning them is quite simple. Clip off the eyes and mouth. Lift
the top shell and remove the soft feather-like gills and discard
them. Turn the crab bottom up. Tear off and discard the cartlidge.
(the shape of the female's is half-oval, the male's is a narrow
triangle).
