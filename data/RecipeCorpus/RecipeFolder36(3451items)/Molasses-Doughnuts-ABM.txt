Title: Molasses Doughnuts ABM
Categories: Desserts, Breads, Kooknet
Yield: 16 doughnuts
1 ts Ginger
2 ts Cinnamon
3 3/4 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Yeast
1/2 c  Powdered Sugar; or
1/2 c  Granulated Sugar
3 tb Shortening
3    Eggs
1/2 c  Molasses
1/2 c  Water
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Baking Powder
4 tb Buttermilk; dried
Make sure all ingredients are at room temperature.  Place the first 11
ingredients in the machine. Program for knead and first rise and press
start. The dough will be just a little sticky; a tiny amount will
stick to your finger. It does hold some shape while kneading.  Flour
your work surface and rolling pin. When the cycle is complete, turn
the dough out onto the floured surface and let it sit for 10 minutes.
Roll the dough to 1/3" thick. Use enough flour to keep the dough from
sticking. Cut doughnuts with cutter.

Place the doughnuts on a greased baking sheet and cover with a clean
towel. Let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk. Heat 1 1/2 to
2" of oil in saucepan or deep fryer. Use a thermometer to help keep
the temperature constant. Fry 2 to 3 doughnuts at a time.  Fry them
for 2 to 3 minutes, turning frequently and spooning the hot oil over
them. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Check the
first few for doneness. Shake the warm doughnuts, 3 or 4 at a time,
in a sturdy paper bag with sugar in it.
