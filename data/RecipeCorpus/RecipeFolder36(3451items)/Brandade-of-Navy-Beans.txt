Categories: Dips/spread, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
4    Garlic clove(s), crushed
3/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon
1/4 c  Heavy cream
Salt and pepper to taste
1 1/2 c  Dried navy beans
1 md Bay leaf
1    Sprig thyme
1    Sprig rosemary
1 pt Chicken stock
Place beans in colander, rinse, and pick over them. Put beans in large
stockpot, cover with cold water, and soak for at least 3 hours, or
overnight.

Drain beans and return to stockpot.

Place the bay leaf, thyme, and rosemary in a cheesecloth bag tied with
kitchen twine.

Add the chicken stock and cheesecloth bag to the beans. Bring to a
boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the beans are tender
but not mushy, about 35-40 min. Uncover and skim the surface of the
stock from time to time to remove any scum that rises to the surface/

Remove the pot from the heat and discard the cheesecloth bag. Place
the beans in a food processor with the garlic and olive oil and
blend. Slowly add the lemon juice and cream, blending until well
incorporated, but not overmixed. Season with salt and pepper, then
pour into a bowl. Serve with toasted pita or French bread.
