Categories: Vegetables, Side dish, Potatoes
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Water
Pinch salt
Pinch ground ginger
6 lg Sweet potatoes
2 tb Margerine
3/4 c  Dark brown sugar
Place potatoes in a large pan; cover with cold water.  Bring to a
boil; cook 10 mins.  Plunge potatoes in cold water to stop cooking.
When cool enough to handle, peel and discard skin.  Cut potatoes into
thick slices or chunks; refrigerate.  If desired, this can be done
the day before.

In a large nonstick skillet, melt margerine.  Add brown sugar, water,
salt and ginger.  Bring to a simmer; add half of potato slices in one
layer. Cook at a slow boil over medium heat until potatoes are brown
and crisp around the edges.  Turn; brown on other side.  With a
slotted spoon, transfer potatoes to a platter; reserve in a warm
place near the stove. Add remaining potatoes to skillet; cook as the
first batch. Serve immediately.  Makes 8 servings.
