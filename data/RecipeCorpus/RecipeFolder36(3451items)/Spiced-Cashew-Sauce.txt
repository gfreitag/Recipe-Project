Title: Spiced Cashew Sauce

Yield: 2 cups
2 tb Rice wine vinegar

1 ts Salt
1 c  Unsalted roasted cashews *
3 tb Canola or vegetable oil

* If unsalted cashews are not available, use salted ones. To remove
the salt, saute the nuts for 10 seconds in 2 tbs vegetable oil,
remove the nuts from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on paper
towels.

Place the cashes on a roasting sheet in a 300 F oven and heat for

Measure 1 tbs canola oil into a small pan set over medium heat. Add
the garlic and saute until soft but not browned, about 1 min. Remove
from the heat.

Place all of the ingredients, including the warm nuts and garlic, in
a food processor and blend on high speed for 45 seconds. If the
mixture is too thick, dilute with water to desired consistency.
