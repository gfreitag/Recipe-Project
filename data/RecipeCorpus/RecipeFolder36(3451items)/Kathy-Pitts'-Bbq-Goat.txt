Title: Kathy Pitts' Bbq Goat
Categories: Bbq/grill, Meats
Yield: 1 goat
Beer
Lemon pepper
1 sm Goat kid
Orange juice
I've barbecued it succesfully, using a wet marinade of half orange
juice and half beer (marinate at LEAST overnight, longer would be
better.) Rub the meat well with lemon pepper, pop on a covered
barbecue pit with VERY low heat, and hot smoke until tender, basting
occasionally with the orange juice/beer mixture.  This is going to
take a LONG time, something close to 12-18 hours.

The folks who ate the goat said it was delicious.  Personally, I
haven't a clue, because I was so tired of smelling the darn thing, I
didn't eat any.
