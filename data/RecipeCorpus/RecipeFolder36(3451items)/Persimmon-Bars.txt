Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Salt
1 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1 c  Chopped walnuts or
-pecans
-Lemon glaze (recipe
-follows)
1 c  Persimmon puree *
1 ts Baking soda
1    Egg
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Salad oil
8 oz Pitted dates
-(about 1-1/2 c lightly
-packed), finely snipped
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
Persimmon Puree: You'll need fully ripe pointed-tip persimmons--pulp
should be soft and jelly like. Cut fruits in half and scoop out pulp
with a spoon. Discard skin, seeds, and stem.  In a blender or food
processor, whirl pulp, a portion at a time, until smooth (you'll need
2 or 3 med. size persimmons for 1 cup puree). For each cup puree,
thoroughly stir in 1-1/2 tsp. lemon juice. To store, freeze in 1-cup
batches in rigid containers; thaw, covered, at room temperature.

Prepare persimmon puree; measure out 1 cup and stir in baking soda.
Set aside.  In a large bowl, lightly beat egg; then stir in sugar,
oil, and dates.

In another bowl, stir together flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and
cloves; add to date mixture alternately with persimmon mixture,
stirring just until blended.  Stir in walnuts. Spread batter evenly
in a lightly greased, flour-dusted 10 by 15-inch rimmed baking pan.
Bake in a 350 degrees F oven for 25 minutes or until top is lightly
browned and a pick inserted in center comes out clean.

Let cool in pan on a rack for 5 minutes.  Prepare Lemon Glaze: In a
small bowl, stir together 1 cup powdered sugar and 2 tbs. lemon juice
until smooth. Spread over cookies. Let cool completely; then cut into
2 by 2-1/2 inch bars. Store covered. Makes 2-1/2 dozen.
