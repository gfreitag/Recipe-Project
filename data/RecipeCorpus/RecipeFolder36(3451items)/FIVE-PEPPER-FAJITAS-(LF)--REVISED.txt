Slice the chicken into chunks about 1/2 inch square.
Place them in a large bowl.  Squeeze the lime juice over chicken.
Add the garlic, scallions, black pepper, and cumin, and toss to mix.
Slice the bell peppers into strips and set aside. Wrap the tortillas
in a thin, clean dishcloth, place them on an ovenproof plate, and put
the plate in the oven. Warm the tortillas at the lowest setting on
your oven while preparing the fajita mixture.  Heat the oil and water
in a large saucepan over medium heat and add the chicken, bell
peppers, and jalapeno peppers. Add the greater amount of jalapeno if
you like your food very spicy. Saute, stirring frequently, until the
chicken and vegetables are cooked through, about 25 minutes. Add salt
to taste. Spread a spoonful of the fajita mixture in a thick line in
the middle of each tortilla. Top with cilantro, tomato, and salsa to
taste. Roll up the tortillas and serve. Makes 4 servings of 2 fajitas
each.

NOTE:  You can buy prepared salsa in the supermarket or you can make
your own.  See Mexican-Style Hot Sauce recipe.

We made this for dinner, it was DELICIOUS!  Instead of using the
scallions we used a medium onion, sliced thin.
