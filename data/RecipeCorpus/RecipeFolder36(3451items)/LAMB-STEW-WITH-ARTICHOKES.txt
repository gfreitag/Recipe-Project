Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM-----------------------GUY E. ATWOOD----------------------------
1 ts Mint leaves
2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ea Onions, chopped
1    Eggs
1 tb Lemon juice
2 lb Lamb
2 ea Onions
1 tb Oil
2 tb Flour
1 ts Salt
6 ea Artichokes
Cube lamb.  Quarter onions.  In Dutch oven, quickly brown meat and
onions in oil over medium high heat.  Lower heat and sprinkle flour
into pan. Stir until well blended.  Add salt and enough water to just
cover meat. Simmer, uncovered, until meat is half done.

Prepare artichokes by cutting off tops and removing small outer tough
leaves.  With scissors, square cut each remaining leaf. Place in cold
water to which you have added a few drops of lemon juice. Drain and
stand them on meat.  Chop mint leaves and mix with lemon juice; spoon
over artichokes. Lightly salt. Scatter chopped onions over artichokes
and meat. Cover tightly and simmer until artichokes and lamb are
done, about 12 hours.

Remove artichokes and meat and arrange on platter.  Beat egg, add
lemon juice and salt.  Add some broth and mix well.  Add back into
remaining broth and cook over low heat until thickened, making sure
you stir constantly.  Pour over meat and serve with good ol' Oriental
sticky rice or (God forbid) noodles.
