2 oz Prosciutto ham, finely
-chopped
2 c  Bread cubes, lightly toasted
-on a baking sheet
1 lb Fresh chestnuts
2 c  Chicken stock
1/2 lb Breakfast-style or sweet

Peel the chestnuts and cut each into quarters.  Gently simmer the
chestnuts in the stock in a saucepan over medium heat for 10 minutes,
or until tender.

Crumble the sausage and brown it in a frying pan over medium heat.
Transfer the sausage to a colander to drain off the fat.

Melt the butter in the sausage pan.  Cook the celery over low heat
for 5 minutes, or until tender, adding the ham after 3 minutes.
Stir in the bread cubes, cooked sausage, cooked chestnuts, half of
the stock, and salt and pepper to taste.  Add stock as necessary; the
stuffing should be moist but not soggy.

Spoon the stuffing into a buttered baking dish; cover with foil and
bake in a 350 F oven for 15 minutes, or until thoroughly heated.
Alternatively, spoon the stuffing into the cavity of a capon or
turkey.
