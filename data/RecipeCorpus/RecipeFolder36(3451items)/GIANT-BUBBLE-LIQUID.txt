Categories: Kids, Kooknet

5 c  Water; distilled is best
2 tb Glycerine

1/2 c  Joy or Dawn dish detergent
Mix the dish detergent with the water. (Measure carefully, it makes
a big difference. Stir. Add the glycerine (you can usually get this
in a drug store), this makes more durable bubbles. You can bend a
wire coat hanger into a circle and wind a string around it. Depending
on how big you make your circle, you get great big bubbles. The
string helps in getting the liquid to stay on the circle. You can
also use straws and string-Tie a 2 1/2 foot length of string though
two straws and unleash square bubbles <G>. The trick is to dip your
string and straw thing into the solution and wave it in the air.
Break the bubble off by flipping the apparatus up a bit. Plain straws
make good bubble pipes. Also try using the plastic strawberry
baskets, they make lots of little bubbles. It is fun to experiment
with all different bubble makers. Big-time bubble making is a bit
like fishing. You'll have much better luck in cool wet weather. Early
evenings, nighttime and early mornings are often good. Just after a
rain is ideal. Don't throw any leftovers away, the longer it sits the
better it becomes.
