Make the chocolate ice cream: Put the chocolate into a medium bowl.
In a medium bowl,using a wire whisk,stir the yolks,sugar and salt
until blended. In a heavy medium saucepan, bring the cream and milk
to a gentle boil. Remove the pan from the heat. Gradually whisk
about 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the beaten egg yolks until
blended. Return this mixture to the saucepan.

Continue cooking over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a
wooden spoon, for 3 to 5 minutes, until the custard has thickened
slightly. Do not allow the custard to boil. It is done when you can
run your finger down the back of the coated spoon and the path
remains in the custard. Immediately re- move the pan from the heat,
and pour the custard over the chocolate. Let stand for 30 seconds
and then whisk until smooth. Strain the chocolate custard through a
fine-meshed strainer into a stainless steel bowl. Place the bowl
over a larger bowl of ice water and stir the custard for 5 to 10
minutes, or until cool. Remove the bowl from the ice water and stir
in the vanilla. Cover the surface of the custard with plastic wrap
and refrigerate for 2 hours, or until very cold.

Scrape the chilled custard into an ice cream maker and freeze
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pack the ice cream
into a covered container and freeze for at least 2 or 3 hours, or
overnight. Make the mocha chip ice cream: In a medium saucepan,
combine the cream, half- and-half and espresso beans. Bring to a
gentle boil, and remove from the heat. Place the cocoa powder in a
small bowl. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the hot cream mixture to the
cocoa and stir well until a smooth paste forms. Return the cocoa
powder mixture to the saucepan and whisk until smooth. Cover and
allow to infuse for 30 minutes.
