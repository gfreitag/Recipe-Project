Categories: Pasta/rice, Appetizers, Salads
Yield: 6 servings
Fresh ground black pepper
1/4 c  Fresh squeezed lemon juice
2 ts Dried herbes de provence
1 lb Penne
1 1/2 c  Firm-pack chop fresh basil
Few fresh basil leaves
2    Medium-size eggplants
1 c  Olive oil
Salt
2    Medium-size onions, sliced
3    Sweet bell peppers
4    Cloves garlic, minced
PREP: Cut the eggplant into 1-inch cubes; do not peel.  Use red,
green or gold sweet bell peppers, or a mixture; slice thin.
1.  Place eggplant cubes in a shallow baking pan, toss with 1/2 cup
olive oil, sprinkle with salt to taste, and bake in a 400 degree F
oven until cubes are soft but still hold their shape, about 30
minutes.  Set aside to cool.
2.  Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large heavy frying pan.  Add onions
and sweet peppers and cook over very low heat until vegetables are
quite tender and slightly caramelized, about 35-45 minutes.  Stir in
garlic and salt and pepper to taste; cook 5 minutes longer.
3.  Combine the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, lemon juice, herbes de
provence, and salt and pepper to taste.  Whisk and reserve.
4.  Cook penne in 4 quarts boiling water until very al dente.  Drain
and rinse well in cold water, then drain again.  With a sharp knife,
diagonally slice each piece of pasta in half crosswise.  Toss in a
large bowl with onion mixture and reserved dressing.
5.  Toss eggplant cubes and chopped basil with pasta.  Garnish with
basil leaves.
Serves 6 to 8 as first course; 10 to 12 as a salad.
