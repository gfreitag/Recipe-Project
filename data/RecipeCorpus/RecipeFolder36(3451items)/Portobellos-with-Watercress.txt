Title: Portobellos with Watercress
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
Cleaned, stems removed
Sliced 1/2" thick
Salt
Mixed green salad (opt)
1/2 c  Watercress
Stems removed
1 tb White wine vinegar
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 lg Portobello caps
Note: If you want to saute the portobello stems, slice them
lengthwise into quarters; saute them for a minute before adding the
caps because they are firmer and take longer to cook.
Combine the watercress,  1/4 cup water, and the vinegar in a blender
and blend until you have a puree. Transfer to a large saute pan along
with the oil and begin to warm over medium heat. Add the mushroom
caps. Lightly salt the mushrooms, and cover with a loose-fitting lid.
Braise for 3 min. Remove the lid and season to taste. Serve alone or
in a salad with mixed greens.
