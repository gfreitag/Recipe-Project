Categories: Vegetables, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Vermouth, dry
1/2 c  Crme Frache
1/2 c  Jarlsberg cheese, grated
Plus addl for topping
2 tb Heavy cream
4 lg Baking potatoes
Salt & pepper to taste
1/2 c  Onion, yellow, chopped
1/2 c  Mushrooms, fresh, chopped
2 c  Lobster, cooked (or crab)
Scrub and dry the potatoes. Cut a small deep slit in the top of
each. Set the potatoes on the middle rack of a preheated 375øF. oven
and bake about 1 hour, or until potatoes are tender when pricked with
a fork.
Let potatoes cool slightly, cut off and discard the tops, and
scrape the potato pulp into a bowl. Do not scrape so deeply that you
tear the potato skin. Salt and pepper the potato shells; reserve.
Mash the potato pulp; reserve.
Melt the butter in a small skillet and saut the chopped onion,
covered, until tender and lightly colored, about 25 minutes. Add the
mushrooms and saut for another 5 minutes. Stir in the lobster or
crab. Season with salt and pepper, add the vermouth, then raise heat
to a boil. Stir frequently over high heat until all liquid has boiled
away. Stir in crme frache and remove from heat.
Combine lobster mixture with the reserved mashed potato pulp and
1/2 cup Jarlsberg. Taste, correct seasoning; add heavy cream if the
mixture seems too dry.
Stuff the mixture into the reserved potato skins; mound the filling
slightly. Sprinkle additional grated cheese on top and place on baking
sheet.
Bake again at 400øF., until potatoes are hot and cheese is
bubbling. Serve immediately
