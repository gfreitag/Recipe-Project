Title: Vegetarian Spring Rolls
Categories: Main dish, Side dish, Wok
Yield: 1 servings
16    6 inch round rice paper
-wrappers
2 c  Bean thread noodles, soaked
-in hot water and cut into
-2 inch lengths
2 lg Carrots; peeled and shaved
2 tb Chopped green onion tops
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Minced fresh cilantro
1/4 ts Black pepper
Place carrots, green onions, oil, cilantro and pepper into a large
bowl. Toss well.

Fill another large bowl with warm water.  Dip each paper round in
water until softened and translucent, about 10 seconds.  Remove;
drain on dish towel (do not stack rice paper to avoid sticking).

Place 2T noodles and 2T veg mixture along lower edge of rice paper, 1
inch from edge.  Fold bottom of paper over filling; fold sides over
filling. Roll bundle into a cylinder.  Repeat with remaining rice
paper and filling.

Place rolls on a plate; cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate while
preparing the rest of the meal.  Makes 8 rolls, 2 rolls per serving.

Helpful hints:  Bean thread noodles need to be soaked 30 mins prior to
use.  To prepare them more quickly, cook in boiling water until clear
and glossy, 1-2 mins.  To make handling easier, chill soaked or
cooked noodles before cutting to length.  The noodles are too
delicate and brittle to cut before soaking and cooling.

If desired, serve rolls with a simple dipping sauce of 2T light soy
sauce, 2T brown sugar, and 2T lime juice, or top with your favorite
spicy Thai peeanut sauce.

Per roll 104 cals, 1g fat.

Magazine's note:  Bean thread noodles are translucent threads made
from the starch of green mung beans.  Sold dried, they must be soaked
in hot water or deep fried before using.  Also called cellophane
noodles.
