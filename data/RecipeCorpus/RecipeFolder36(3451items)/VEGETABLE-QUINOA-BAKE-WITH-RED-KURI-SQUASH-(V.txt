Title: VEGETABLE QUINOA BAKE WITH RED KURI SQUASH (V
Categories: Blank
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 c  Quinoa, rinsed well
2 c  Peeled and diced red kuri,
Pumpkin, or other winter
Squash
1 c  Chopped kale or escarole
2 tb Fresh parsley or 1TBSP dried
(I forgot!)
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
x  White wine or veggie stock
1 md Onion, chopped
8    To 10 mushrooms, sliced
1 lg Bell pepper, diced
1    Jalapeno pepper, seeded and
Minced (optional) (or more)
1 sm Zucchini, diced
2    Cloves garlic, minced
3 c  Water (I used Frontier No
Salt veggie broth)
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Saute with wine or broth
the onion, mushrooms, peppers, zucchini, and garlic
for about 5 minutes. Stir in rest of ingredients and
bring to a boil. (I did NOT stir in the greens,
instead I placed them in the bottom of the dish
first.) Transfer mixture to a 9x13 casserole dish and
cover. Bake until liquid is absorbed, about 35 to 40
minutes. Remove from oven and fluff with a fork. Let
stand 5 minutes before serving.  Makes 6-8 servings
(acc. to VT... for me it's 4 servings if it's the main
dish).
