The fun of roasting vegetables is devising your own combinations of
vegetables, herbs, oils, and vinegars. Here are some possibilities:

~ butternut squash with hazelnut oil
~ asparagus and mushrooms with walnut oil and tarragon vinegar
~ potatoes and garlic with olive oil and rosemary
~ beets and shallots with raspberry vinegar
~ corn and peas with olive oil, basil and mint
~ wild mushrooms with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, sage, and thyme
~ red onions with olive oil and sherry vinegar
~ eggplant and garlic with toasted sesame seed oil and rice vinegar
~ zucchini, fennel, and tomatoes with olive oil and parsley

Heat the oven to 450 F. Spread the vegetables in one layer in a
baking dish just large enough to hold them. Roast for about 50 min,
shaking the pan once or twice. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and
serve hot or at room temperature.
