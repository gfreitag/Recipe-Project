Spicy Thai Dressing
2 3/16 lb Black Tiger Shrimp, shell on
Commercial Thai Sauce preparations are available such as "President's
Choice - Spicy Thai Dressing" (in Canada). In a stainless steel or
ceramic bowl, marinate the Shell-on Black Tiger Shrimp (rinsed if
defrosted) for 1-1/2 to 2 hours in sufficient Thai sauce to cover. Do
not marinate longer or shrimp will start to cook in the marinate and
take on a rubbery texture. Barbecue shrimp in shells over hot coals
3-4 minutes each side. The shells keep the meat moist. Serve
immediately with a suitable dipping sauce.
