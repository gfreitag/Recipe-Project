MMMMM------------------SESAME-SOY DIPPING SAUCE-----------------------
1 ts Ginger; minced
1 ts Sesame Oil
1/2 c  Soy Sauce
2 tb Chinese Black Vinegar
1 tb Garlic; minced
Squeeze all the moisture from the spinach, then combine it with the
pork, onions, cilantro, soy sauce, sherry, ginger, sesame oil and
garlic; mix well.

Lay a potsticker wrapper on a potsticker press. Spoon 2 ts filling
into the center of the wrapper. Brush the edges of the wrapper with
egg white. Press the two halves of the press together firmly. Gently
remove the folded and crimped dumpling; lay the dumplings on a flat
surface, crimped edges up, to form a flat bottom. Repeat with
remainder of filling and wrappers.

Heat 2 tb oil in a 12" heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add as
many potstickers as you can get in the pan without crowding, and cook
until golden brown on the bottom. Add 1/2 cup of the broth and cover
the pan immediately (as soon as the broth comes in contact with the
oil a major amount of splattering and sizzling occurs, so be
careful.) Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook the dumplings until
most of the liquid has been absorbed and the potstickers are nicely
plumped and a deep golden brown on the bottom.

Remove from heat and keep warm in a 200Ã¸F. oven while you cook the
remaining potstickers in the same manner. In a small container,
combine the dipping sauce ingredients. Serve the sauces in separate
dishes with the potstickers.
