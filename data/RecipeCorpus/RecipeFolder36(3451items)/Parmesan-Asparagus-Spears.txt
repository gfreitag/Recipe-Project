Yield: 8 servings
1 ts Salt
2 1/2 lb Asparagus spears (medium)
2 tb Grated parmesan cheese
1 tb Balsamic vinegar
1 ts Olive oil
1 ts Dijon mustard
Stir together vinegar, oil and mustard in a large bowl.  Set aside
while cooking asparagus.

Heat 2 in. water and half the salt to boiling in a large, deep
skillet. Break or slice off the tough lower stems of the asparagus
spears.  Rinse and place half the spears in the boiling water.  Cover
and cook 5 to 6 minutes, or just until tender crisp.  Transfer
asparagus with tongs or a slotted spatula to the bowl with the
vinegar mixture.

In fresh boiling water, cook remaining asparagus with the rest of the
salt.  Transfer to the bowl with the vinegar mixture.  Toss gently
until spears are evenly coated.

Place asparagus on a serving plate.  Sprinkle evenly with cheese.

For a more sophisticated look, try shaving the cheese witha vegetable
parer instead of grating it.  If you like, garnish th platter with
fresh orange sections.
