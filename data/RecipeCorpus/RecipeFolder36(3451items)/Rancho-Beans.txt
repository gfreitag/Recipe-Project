Title: Rancho Beans
Categories: Side dish, Kooknet
Yield: 6 servings
3 ts Pure Chile Powder
Salt
Black Pepper
1 lb Pinto or Pink Beans
1    Ham Hock
1    Onion; chopped
2    Cloves Garlic; minced
Pick over beans for debris; rinse well and drain. Place in a 4 quart
pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil, simmer 3 minutes. Remove
from heat, cover, and let soak for at least 4 hours.

Pour off water. Add 5 cups fresh water, or just enough to cover beans.
Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to maintain a gentle bubbling.
Add ham bone, onion and garlic. Partially cover (a whisper of steam
should escape.) Cook 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until beans are not
sticking; give them a stir. Keep a kettle with hot water on stove --
if cooking liquid drops below the level of the beans, add no more
than 1/2 cup water.

When beans are tender, add chile powder, salt and pepper. Simmer 30
minutes longer. Scoop out 2 cups beans with a little cooking liquid.
Roughly puree in blender on low speed. Stir puree back into beans and
cook for a few minutes, stirring, until beans have thickened.
