Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 48 servings
4 c  Flour
1/4 ts Baking soda
2 tb Water
1 c  Pecans
1 1/2 c  Shortening
3/4 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
2    Eggs
Preheat the oven to 325.  In a large bowl, cream together the
shortening, sugar and salt with an electric mixer on medium speed.
Add the eggs and beat well.  While mixing, slowly add the flour,
baking soda and water. Chop the pecans into very small bits using a
food processor on low speed. The pieces should be about the size of
rice grains.  Add the pecans to the dough and knead with your hands
until the pecans are well blended into the mixture.  Roll the dough
into 1" balls and press flat with your hands onto ungreased baking
sheets.  The cookies should be about 2" in diameter and 1/2" thick.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are
golden brown.
