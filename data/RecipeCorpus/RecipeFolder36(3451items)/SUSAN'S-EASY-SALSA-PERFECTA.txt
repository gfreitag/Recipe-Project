Title: SUSAN'S EASY SALSA PERFECTA
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
Tomatoes (don't drain, but
Pull them out of the juice)
x  Sea salt and fresh ground
Pepper
x  Squeeze of lemon
x  Fresh cilantro leaves
1    Clove (or 2 small cloves)
Garlic
2    Scallions, with some green
3    6 fresh jalapenos, seeded
(and roasted* for best
Taste)
1    28-oz  can Progresso**
Pulse first 3 ingredients a little. Add remaining ingredients and
pulse. Enjoy.

*Not necessary to roast, but extra delicious if you do.  Just turn the
peppers over a hot burner until skins turn black and blister.  Peel
most off as soon as they're slightly cool, but don't be over-fussy.
The little black bits make the salsa look and taste just like the
best restaurants'.

**Susan says that Progresso brand is essential.  She's tried others,
but this makes the best.
