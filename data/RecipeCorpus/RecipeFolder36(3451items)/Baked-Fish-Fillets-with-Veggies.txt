I take fish fillets (any kind) and put them in an oven proof dish. I
cover with Green Giant vegetable mixtures (any kind that you prefer
or their pasta accents) and then add 1/2 can of tomatoes. I bake in
an oven warmed to 350 for about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle parmesan cheese
on top and serve with rice, baked potato, pasta or just a salad. It's
delicious and doesn't cost any optional calories.

2 oz. cooked fish = 1 protein selection.

This is my own concoction for fish but I cooked it for my
sister-in-law and she loved it.  I'm not much of a fish eater but
with 2 for 1 on the protein, it's becoming more popular in my diet
plans. Lori in MD.
