Da! Russian overabundance of calories? Nyet!
Trim away all fat from meat. Cut into 2" chunks. Place in small bowl
together with onion, garlic, shallot, parsley, cayenne pepper and
pomegranate juice. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Remove meat from marinade and pat dry. Skewer the meat, using four
substantial skewers. Brush with oil. Broil under very high heat,
turning often until done. Some prefer it slightly pink (12 minutes).
Well done will take about 20 minutes. Remove from skewers and serve
on a heated plate with Kasha.
VARIATIONS: Include 2 green peppers cut into 12 chunks, 4 tomatoes
cut into quarters, and 4 small, white onions, peeled and cut in half.
Skewer alternate chunks of vegetable and meat chunks. Proceed
according to recipe.
