Categories: Bbq/grill, Meats, Salsa/sauce, Main dish
Yield: 12 servings
2    Cloves Garlic; Minced
1 md Fresh Or Canned Green Chile
Seeded And Minced; OR
2 ts Chili Powder
1 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly Ground Black Pepper
3 1/2 lb Beef Brisket; In 1 Piece
1 c  Catsup
1/2 c  Cider Vinegar
1/4 c  Worcestershire Sauce
1/4 c  (1/2 Cube) Butter
3    Ribs Celery; Finely Chopped
1 md Onion; Finely Chopped
When the fire has burned down to hot coals, spread to provide
moderate heat and fit a drip pan in front of in the center of the
coals. Place the brisket, fat side up, over the drip pan. Cover the
grill and adjust the dampers to maintain slow steady heat. While the
meat is cooking, in a sauce pan combine all of the other ingredients,
blending well, and simmer for 10 minutes.  After 1 hour, baste the
meat lightly with the sauce and turn the meat as needed to cook
evenly. Replenish the fire as needed, but don't pile the coals, as
the brisket should cook slowly.  Cook 4 to 5 hours total until the
meat almost falls apart. Sprinkle 2 to 3 handfuls of hickory chips,
that have been soaked in water, over the coals. Cover the grill or
enclose the top of the meat in a sheet of foil, tucked around the
bottom edges of the meat and let the hickory smoke the meat for 10 to
15 minutes. Remove the cover and brush the meat with the sauce. Place
the meat on a platter and slice.  It will crumble. Serve the meat and
the remaining sauce on split and buttered sandwich buns. Any leftover
sandwiches can be frozen and reheated in a Microwave or conventional
oven, or the shredded meat and sauce can be frozen together to reheat
later for sandwiches.
