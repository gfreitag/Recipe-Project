Title: Risotto with Saffron and Dried Cherries
Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Arborio rice
1 c  Dry white wine
Salt and pepper to taste
1 c  Dried cherries
Or any dried fruit
6 c  (to 8 cups) chicken stock
4 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
1 pn Saffron threads
1 lg Yellow onion(s), peeled
Finely chopped
Place the chicken in a large saucepan and heat to a simmer. Keep warm.

Heat the oil in a large, heavy saucepan over moderately high heat.
Add the saffron, stir for 1 min, then add the onion. Saute until the
onion is soft but not browned, about 2 min. Add the rice and cook,
stirring constantly, for about 3 min. Immediately stir in the wine
and reduce the heat to medium. Continue to stir until the wine is
absorbed, then add 1 cup of the hot stock. Cook, stirring constantly,
until the stock is absorbed. Continue stirring and adding stock in
1/2-cup portions, allowing each  1/2 cup to become fully absorbed
before adding more, until the rice is tender yet retains its shape.
This will take about 15 min.

Remove the pan from the heat and season with salt and pepper. Cover
the pan and let sit for 2 min, then fold in the cherries. Spoon the
risotto into bowls and serve immediately.
