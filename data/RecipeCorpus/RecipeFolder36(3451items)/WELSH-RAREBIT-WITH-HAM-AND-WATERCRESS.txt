1. Beat eggs until well blended.
2. Stir remaining sauce ingredients, together with the eggs, in a
double-boiler. The type of beer used is a personal preference. A
variety beer such as an imported German, British, etc beer is
recommended so as to make the recipe less ordinary. A Pilsener or
Lager may add more foam to the mixture and make the rarebit lighter
in texture. 3. Bring a double-boiler to the boil then reduce heat to
medium to heat mixture. Leave mixture uncovered and stir mixture
thoroughly about once every minute.
4. When the desired consistency is achieved, Beat mixture with rotary
beater or electric mixer until very smooth. Leave in double-boiler to
maintain temperature.
5. Toast bread slices. Home-made bread, sliced slightly thicker than
commercial bread, is preferrable. Variety home-made breads would vary
texture and flavour.
6. Drape 1 to 2 slices of Black Forest Ham (or alternative
delicatessen meat slices) over toasted bread. Place on dinner plate
and set in warming oven approx 10 min. prior to serving.
7. Steam watercress with julienne green peppers until heated through.
These vegetables should be as close to uncooked as possible, although
heated. Microwave may be utilized (approx 2 min at high). Wild
watercress would enhance flavour.
8. Mound a portion of watercress and green pepper in the middle of
the ham slices on the serving plates. Ladle a generous amount of the
rarebit over the vegetables, ham and toast - allowing it to flow to
cover the plate bottom. Accent plate by dropping thinly sliced
uncooked tomato on the top of each mound.
