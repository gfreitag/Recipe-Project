coarse sieve and then blend again, adding the residue from the
strainer. Continue until you have a puree and all of the mix has
cleared the strainer. Remove to a bowl to free blender for next step.

In the skillet, add the remaining 2 tbs canola oil and bring up to
moderate heat. Add chocolate, cinnamon stick, sugar and salt and cook
for no more than 2 min. Remove to blender and add  1/2 cup warm
water. Blend until nearly a puree (use more water if needed). Strain
and discard coriander seeds stick residue.

Combine both mixtures in skillet and simmer until thick.
