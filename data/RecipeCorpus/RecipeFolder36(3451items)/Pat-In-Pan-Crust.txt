Title: Pat-In-Pan Crust
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
3 tb Cold milk
1 1/2 c  Plus 3 tbsp. all pur flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Sugar
Makes pastry for a single crust 8 or 9 inch pie

Quick, crisp but tender, it needs no rolling out.  This recipe can
only be used for one crust pies.--you can't double the recipe and
roll out a top crust.

Place the flour, sugar, and salt in the pie pan and mix with your
fingers until blended.  In a measuring cup, combine the oil and milk
and beat with a fork until creamy.  Pour all at once over the flour
mixture. Mix with a fork until the flour mixture is completely
moistened.  Pat the dough with your fingers, first up the sides of
the plate, then across the bottom.  Flute the edges.
Shell is now ready to be filled.  If you are preparing a shell to fill
later, or your recipe requires a prebaked crust, preheat the oven to
425 F. Prick the surface of the pastry with a fork and bake 15 min.,
checking often, and pricking more if needed.
VARIATION:  For a 10 inch shell, use 2 cups all purpose flour; 2 tsp.
sugar; 1 tsp. salt; 2/3 cup vegetable oil; 3 tbsp. milk
