Title: Poached Salmon
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Guestchefs, Holiday
Yield: 4 servings
Salt To Taste
White Pepper To Taste
4    Lemon Wedges
2 lb Salmon Fillets
2 tb Chopped Scallions
1 c  Dry White Wine
Scrape away white film on skin side of salmon fillets.  Cut fillets
into 4 pieces about 8 ounces each.  Scatter scallions in a large
skillet wide enough to fit fillets in single layer.  Butter one side
of a piece of aluminum foil as large as the skillet.  Pour wine into
skillet and heat to simmering.  Sprinkle salmon lightly with salt and
pepper.  Gently slip fillets into wine.  Add cold water if needed to
partially submerge fillets. Place foil, buttered side down,  on fish.
Simmer very gently until tops of fillets are opaque and nearly firm,
8-10 minutes.  Remove from heat and let cool in liquid at least 10
minutes.  Salmon can be served warm or at room temperature.  To
serve, drain fillets using a large slotted spatula, and place on
dinner plates.  From: Syd's Cookbook.
