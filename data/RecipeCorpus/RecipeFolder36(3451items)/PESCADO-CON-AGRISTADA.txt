1/2 lemon
To poach the fish, combine the water, lemon juice, parsley, salt and
pepper in a large deep skillet. Add the fish fillets, in one layer if
possible. Bring the liquid to a boil, then lower the heat and cover
the skillet. Simmer the fish for 5-10 minutes, or until it is just
cooked through but not falling apart. (If the fillets are thick,
carefully turn them once during the poaching). Use a slotted spoon to
transfer the fish to a deep serving dish. Reserve the broth.
For the sauce, beat the eggs and lemon juice together in a medium
bowl. In a small bowl, mix the cake meal and water to make a creamy
paste. Stir the paste into the egg-lemon mixture. Then gradually stir
in about 1/2 cup of the hot fish broth. Stirring constantly, add all
the egg-lemon mixture back into the hot fish broth and stir over low
heat until the sauce has thickened. Adjust the seasoning, if
necessary. pour the sauce over the fish. Serve hot or, as is more
customary, refrigerate the fish and the sauce and serve them chilled.
