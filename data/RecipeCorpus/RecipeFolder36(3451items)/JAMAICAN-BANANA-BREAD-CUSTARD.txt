Categories: Desserts, Breads, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
3 oz Eagle brand condensed milk
8    Egg yolks
6    Whole eggs
2 1/2 c  Milk
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Nutmeg
5 tb Butter
2/3 c  Granulated sugar
12 sl Dry bread, no crust, broken
Into 3/4 inch pieces
1 lb Ripe bananas
2 tb Dark Jamaican Rum
3 tb Apricot preserves
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter the bottom of an 8 inch square
baking pan with 1 tablespoon of butter and sprinkle with 2
tablespoons of sugar. Place the bread pieces in the bottom of the
pan. Dot with the remaining butter and sprinkle with 1/4 cup sugar.
Slice the bananas lengthwise into halves. Place on top of the bread
and sprinkle with the rum. Spread the apricot preserves evenly over
the bread and banana mixture. Ladle condensed milk over the bread. In
a medium sized bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and whole eggs.
Heat the milk and remaining sugar until the mixture begins to simmer.
Pour the milk slowly into the eggs, stirring constantly until well
blended. Pour over the bread and banana mixture. Sprinkle with
cinnamon and nutmeg. Place a heavy platter or cutting board over the
pan to weigh down the mixture. Allow to sit for 15 minutes. Bake in
the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until an inserted knife comes
out clean. From "Tropic Cooking/by Joyce LaFray Young" / typed by
