Title: Indian Frybread
Categories: Breads, Amerindian
Yield: 16 servings
2 c  Water
Vegetable oil for frying
4 c  All purpose flour
2 tb Baking powder
1 ts Salt
Mix the flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.  Gradually
stir in the water until the dough becomes soft and pliable without
sticking to the bowl.

Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface 5 minutes, folding the
outer edges of the dough in toward the center.

Return the dough to the bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let rest
30 minutes to allow the dough to rise.

Shape the dough into egg-size balls and roll out on a lightly floured
board to a thickness of 1/2 inch (or thinner, for crispier bread). It
is customary to use your hands, but a rolling pin can be used as well.

Place a piece of dough between your hands and pat it from hand to
hand as you would tortilla or pizza dough, until it has stretched to
8 to 10 inches in diameter.  Repeat with the rest of the dough.

With your finger, poke a small air hole in the center of each piece,
to prevent bursting during frying.

Pour approximately 1 1/2 inches of oil into a large frying pan or
saucepan (the saucepan's greater depth will prevent the oil from
splattering) and heat over mediumm heat until the oil is hot but not
smoking.

Carefully place a piece of dough in the hot oil, slipping it in
gently to avoid splattering.  Cook until the dough turns golden brown

and puffs. Turn over with two forks and cook until both sides are
golden brown.

Remove and drain on paper towels until the excess oil is absorbed.
Repeat this process with each piece of dough.  Keep warm between two
clean towels in the oven on low.  Serve immediately. *********

This bread is served during some of the pueblo Feast Days, at family
gatherings, and at other meals.
