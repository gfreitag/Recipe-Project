Title: CHERRY BREAD PUDDING
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
x  Micro dash of salt
8 sl Cracked wheat bread
1 c  Dried pitted cherries
1/2 c  Organic red flame raisins
Spice (optional)
3    Eggs or equivalent egg
Substitute
1/4 c  Dark honey (or 3x this if
You want it sweet)
1 1/2 c  Nonfat plain yogurt
(approx)
Boil some water, pour over cherries and raisins to soak, set aside.

Beat the eggs and honey with a fork until well blended.  Stir in
yogurt and salt.  Break up about 8 slices of cracked wheat bread, or
crumble it up, and stir in.  Add in plumped up cherries and raisins,
drain the water off first.  Pour into a greased 5" x 7" pan, or a
large pie tin. Bake 400 F until the aroma of bread pudding hits your
nose, about 40 minutes.

Serve with a little cinnamon sprinkled on top.

Notes: This is just right in terms of sweetness for me.  In order to
try to placate the sugar gods, I tried it out with caramel sauce, and
it ruined it for me.  Nothing like the taste of burnt sugar to dull
one's taste buds. Nonetheless, the caramel sauce recipe follows.
Optionally mix some spices in with the eggs before baking, such as
1/4 - 1/2 t of cinnamon, mace, allspice, or cardomon powder.
