Title: Raspberry Napoleon
Categories: Desserts, Fruit, Kooknet
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla Extract
1 c  Fresh Raspberries
1 tb Powdered Sugar
6 tb Cold Butter
3/4 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Sour Cream
1 c  Heavy Cream
Cut the butter into pieces. In the bowl of a food processor, combine
the flour, salt and butter and pulse until the mixture resembles
coarse meal. Add the sour cream and process until the dough just
holds together. Press into a disc, wrap and refrigerate at least 2
hours. Flour the dough and roll out between 2 sheets of waxed paper
to 1/8" thick, about an 11 x 11" square. Transfer the dough to a
baking sheet and prick all over with a fork. Refrigerate 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375Ã¸F. Bake the dough until lightly browned,
15-20 minutes. Let cool completely. Trim pastry to an 8 x 8" square
and cut it into eight 2 x 4" rectangles.

Beat the heavy cream with the sugar and vanilla until it holds firm
peaks. Put the whipped cream in a pastry bag fitted with a star tip
and pipe half of it onto for of the rectangles. Arrange the
raspberries on top of the cream, then pipe a second layer of cream
over the raspberries. Top the cream with the remaining pastry
rectangles, flat side up. Cover and refrigerate until serving. Before
serving, dust each Napoleon with powdered sugar.
