Title: Puerto Rican Adobo Powder
Categories: Herbs/spice, Caribbean
Yield: 1 cup
2 tb Cumin seeds
2 tb Garlic powder
6 tb Kosher salt
2 tb White pepper
In Puerto Rico, adobo is a seasoned salt that is generously sprinkled
on meats and seafood prior to grilling, sauteing, or frying.
Supermarkets sell prepared blends that are loaded with MSG. Here's a
homemade version that lends unexpected excitement to any dish.

Combine the salt, peppercorns, and cumin seeds in a dry skillet and
cook over medium heat until the spices are lightly toasted and
fragrant, about 3 min. Transfer the mixture to a bowl to cool.

Combine the roasted spice mixture and garlic powder in a spice mill
and grind to a fine powder.

Store in an airtight container; it will keep for several months.

Note: Pan-roasting the spices isn't traditional, but it greatly
enhances the flavor.
