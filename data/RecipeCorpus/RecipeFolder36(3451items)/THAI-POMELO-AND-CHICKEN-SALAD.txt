Pomelo looks like a thick-skinned, oversized grapefruit, and it is
sweeter than the normal grapefruit.

PEEL AND SEPARATE pomelo segments. Remove and discard membranes.
Gently flake the flesh. If using grapefruit, drain excess juice.
Chill. In large bowl, combine pomelo and shredded chicken. Mix
together the chopped red chili with fish sauce, sugar and lime juice;
toss with chicken mixture. Arrange on a bed of lettuce, garnish with
coriander leaves, peanuts, and 2 teaspoons of the Crisp Fried Shallot
Flakes.

CRISP FRIED SHALLOT FLAKES: Slice shallots into thin slices. Be sure
they are all the same thinness to ensure even cooking. Heat a pan
with the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add shallots and fry slowly
until browned and crisp, about 5 to 10 minutes. The moisture in the
shallots should be completely cooked out. Drain on paper towel.
Stored in an air-tight container, the shallots will keep several
weeks.
