Title: Sprouting Your Own Seeds

The taste of sprouts varies depending on the type of seed used. Try
mung beans, mustard sees, or alfalfa seeds and add them to salads,
soups, sandwiches, and sauteed fish dishes.

Place  1/2 cup seeds in a colander or sieve and rinse well under
running water, then drain. Soak a clean kitchen towel with water and
place it on a shallow try or baking dish. Sprinkle the seeds evenly
over the wet cloth and place the tray in a dark place, such as in a
closet or at the back of a kitchen cabinet. To keep bugs away, cover
the sprouts with an inverted colander or a fine-meshed sieve. Make
sure that during the entire sprouting process the cloth remains damp,
rewetting it as necessary with fresh water.

Over the next few days, check the seeds to see if they have begun to
sprout. The sprouts are usually ready to harvest after 3 days. To
harvest, simply snip the sprouts with scissors along the stems as you
would trim hair. To increase the flavor of the harvested sprouts via
photosynthesis, place them in direct sunlight 1 day prior to eating.

Makes 2 cups.
