Title: Vegan Waffles or Pancakes (banana)
Categories: Breakfast, Pcake/waffl
Yield: 1 servings
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Nutmeg
Vanilla extract to taste opt
1    Ripe banana, mashed
2 c  Water
1/2 c  Oatmeal
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
Mix together the mashed banana and water.  Add dry ingredients and
mix, leaving lumps in batter.
Cook on a waffle iron according to manu's instructions.

Note: You must leave lumps in batter.  Waffle or pancake batter which
is too smooth will spread out very thin on the waffle iron or pan,
and the result will be a rubbyer, tough cake.

You can add small berries to the mix if desired.
