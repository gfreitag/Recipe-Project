Title: CHOCOLATE CHIP-PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE
Categories: Candies, Chocolate
Yield: 12 servings
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Peanut butter
5 3/4 oz Milk chocolate chips; 1 pk
2 c  Sugar
2/3 c  Milk
2 ts Corn syrup, light
1 ts Butter
Combine the sugar, milk and corn syrup in a heavy 3-quart saucepan and
bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until the mixture boils.
Continue boiling without stirring to the soft-ball stage (243 degrees
F on the candy thermometer).  Remove from the heat.  Add the butter
without stirring and cool to lukewarm, 110 degrees F.  Add the
vanilla and peanut butter then beat until the mixture begins to
thicken and lose its gloss. (Watch carefully as this fudge has a
short beating time.)  Quickly add the chocolate pieces and turn into
a 8 X 8 X 2-inch pan.  While warm, mark into squares. Cool until firm
then cut as marked.  Makes about 3 dozen squares.
