In Santa Maria, California, famous for its barbecue, cooks prepare a
menu that includes these beans. Traditionally, small pink beans grown
locally would be used, but small red beans or pintos can be
substituted.

Cover beans with water and soak overnight. Drain and cover with fresh
cold water and simmer 2 hours, or until tender. Meanwhile, saute
bacon and ham until lightly browned. Add garlic and saute 1 or 2
minutes, then add tomato puree, chile sauce, sugar, mustard, salt and
MSG. Drain most of liquid off beans and stir in sauce. Keep warm over
very low heat, or in low oven until ready to serve. Makes 6 to 8
servings.
