Title: CHICKEN-THYME STEW WITH SOUR CREAM
Categories: Poultry, Oldies, Kooknet
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Chopped parsley
1 1/2 ts Dried thyme
1 ts Chicken seasoning(I added)
1 oz (2 T) dry sherry
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/4 c  Nonfat sour cream
15 oz Boneless chicken breasts
1 tb + 1 tsp olive oil
1/2 c  Chopped onion
2 cl Garlic, minced
1 tb Flour
1 1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms
1 c  Chicken broth
1. Cut the chicken into bite size pieces. In a large nonstick skillet,
over medium high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil until hot but not
smoking. Add the chicken and cook, stirring until browned, about 3-5
minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate and cover loosely to keep warm.

2. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil to the skillet. Add the onion
and garlic, and cook, stirring until the onion begins to brown (3-5
minutes). Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, until the flour is no
longer visible, about 30 seconds.

3. Add the mushrooms, chicken broth, parsley, sherry, thyme, and
pepper, and bring to a boil, stirring, until the mixture has
thickened slightly. Return the chicken to the skillet and cook until
heated through, about 1 minute.

4. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the sour cream.

NOTE: You can make this ahead of time, reserving the addition of the
sour cream just before you serve it. I served this over cooked egg
noodles, with French bread and chunky applesauce, and it was GREAT!
