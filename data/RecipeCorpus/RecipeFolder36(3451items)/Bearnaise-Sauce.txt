~-- In a small non-aluminum saucepan, bring the wine, vinegar, onions,
tarragon, parsley and peppercorns to a boil.  Cook until it is
reduced to about 2 tablespoons.  Strain the liquid and press the
solids to get as much of the flavor from them as possible.  Add the
lemon juice and water to the reduced wine mixture and heat to a
simmer.  Whisk the egg yolks in the top of a double boiler until
thick and lemon colored.  Add the above liquid, a tablespoon at a
time and whisk after each addition.  The mixture should be thick and
almost double in size.  Dribble in the butter, whisking constantly
until the mixture forms a slowly dissolving ribbon when drawn across
itself.  Whisk in cayenne.  At this point it should be ready. It is
important to know that the sauce will thicken considerably within the
first few minutes after it is removed from the heat.  The mistake
that most make, is that they try to make Hollandaise and Bearnaise
sauces too thick while over the heat, and the next thing they have is
scrambled eggs floating in butter.  The sauce will thicken in the
first minute after removing from the heat.  From: Syd's Cookbook.
