Title: About Butter Cakes
Categories: Information, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 text file  For flavor and texture butter is preferred over margarine and
shortening. Lard is better for pastries but not cakes. When creamed
the butter should be at room temp: 70 deg. If cooler it will not
disperse into the other ingredients properly. But if it is melted air
will not properly be incorporated into the batter.

Add sugar and beaten egg yolks gradually; beat well after each
addition. The sifted dry ingredients and the liquids are added in
three or more alternating batches. after adding flour, the mixing
should be gentle so as to not develop the gluten. Mix just so the
flour is not dry; over-blending results in too fine a crumb. The egg
whites are beaten until stiff but not dry and folded or cut in gently
but quickly.

Always pre-heat the oven and grease the bottom but not the sides of
the cake pan.
