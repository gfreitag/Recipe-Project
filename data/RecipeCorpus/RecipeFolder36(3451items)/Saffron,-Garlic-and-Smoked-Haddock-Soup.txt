Title: Saffron, Garlic and Smoked Haddock Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 6 servings
Dill, handful of fresh herb
1 pt Water
8 oz To 12 oz Mackerel,
-undyed fillet, skinned
1 pt Milk
Seasoning
12    Garlic cloves (or more
-to taste
1    Onion, peeled and sliced
1 lb Potatoes, waxy type is best
-scrubbed and diced
1 pn Saffron threads
Simmer the garlic, onion, potatoes and saffron in the water, together
with the dill stalks, saving some of the feathery tops for decoration.

When the vegetables are soft, add the fish, cut into pieces, and let
it steam on top of the vegetables for a minute or two.

Remove the dill stalks and put the fish and vegetables into a blender
with half the cold milk, to cool down the mixture, before belnding
it. Add the rest of the milk and bring to the boil. Season to taste
and serve.

If you prefer a chunkier texture, more of a chowder, do not blend the
mixture.

A grating of nutmeg adds a pleasing flavour to the soup.

The smooth version is also very good served chilled, with the dill
blended with a little cream and swirled in.
