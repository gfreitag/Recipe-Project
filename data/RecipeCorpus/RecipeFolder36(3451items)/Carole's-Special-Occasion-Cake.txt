Title: Carole's Special Occasion Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-------------------------CAKE-----------------------------------
1    Yellow cake mix
MMMMM------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
1 lg Can Crushed Pineapple --
-drained
Cool Whip
1 pk 8 oz Cream Cheese, softened
1 c  COLD Milk
1 pk INSTANT French Vanilla (or
Coconut Cream) Pudding
CAKE:
Bake yellow cake mix following package directions for a 9x13 pan.
Cool cake in pan.

TOPPING:
Put cream cheese, COLD milk and pudding in a deep bowl. The mixture is
very thin at first and will be messy. I place plastic wrap around the
bowl, leaving enough room for the beaters.

Beat for 4 minutes until thick and creamy. Spread on cooled cake.

Place drained crushed pineapple on top of pudding mixture.

Place cake in refrigerator.

When ready to serve, top with lots of COOL WHIP. (For some reason it
doesn't taste as good with whipped cream.)
