Title: LAMB (Skewered) with Salsa
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 2 servings
1 tb Olive oil
1    Clove of garlic
59 1/2 oz Lamb Fillet
2 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Honey
Cut the meat into 1-inch slices, and put them in an unpunctured
plastic bag.  Prepare the marinade by heating for 20 seconds on High
(100% power) in a microwave, or combining over heat on the stove the
lemon juice, honey, oil and garlic, until the honey has melted.  Stir
well and cool to room temperature, then pour over the bagged meat and
leave to stand while you make the salsa.
Thread the marinated lamb onto the soaked skewers.  Cook on a
preheated barbecue or under a preheated grill, close to the heat, for
a short time. The kebabs are ready when the outside is brown and the
inside pink but not red.
Serve two kebabs with an avocade half or with a sliced avocado and
salsa, and slices of your favourite bread.
