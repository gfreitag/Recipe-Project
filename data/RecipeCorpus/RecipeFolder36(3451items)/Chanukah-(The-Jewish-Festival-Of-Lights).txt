CHANUKAH
~~~~~~~~
Chanukah, the Jewish Festival Of Lights starts at sundown today.
Many households will be celebrating with potato pancakes called
latkes and jelly doughnuts.

A LITTLE HISTORY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chanukah celebrates a victtory over tyranny and the rededication of
the ancient temple in Jerusalem in 165 BCE. The temple had been
defiled by the ancient Syrian-Greeks. When te Jews came to cleanse
the temple, they found only one small jar of oil ++ just enought to
keep the eternal light burning for one day. Miraculously, it burned
for eight. To commemorate this miracle, a channukiah (candelabra) is
lit for eight days, beginning with one candle on the first day and
adding one more each evening.

TRADITIONAL FOODS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since the holiday is associated with oil, all sorts of food fried
with oil are eaten at Chanukah, such as latkes and doughnuts.

LATKES
~~~~~~
~ Latkes are traditionally served at the Chanukah by Ashkenazi Jews.
~ The basic latke recipe includes grated potatoes, onions, eggs,
matzo meal and salt. The batter is dropped by spoonfull into a hot
frying pan and cooked until golden and crispy.
~ While easy to make, latkes are sold in many stores this time of
year.

GRATE TRICKS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Every type of potato, except baking potatoes, can be used to make
latkes.
~ To increase the nutritional content of latkes, leave the peel on
the potatoes.
~ Grate the potatoes into cold water to revent discoloration. Drain
and squeeze potatoes before adding to other ingredients.

LATKE SIDECARS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Latkes are traditionally served with apple sauce or sour cream.
~ They can also be served with more savoury accompaniments such as
smoked salmon or as a vegetable with a meal.
~ Try them with sliced fresh fruit, yogurt, fruit compote, jam or
creme fraiche.

JELLY DOUGHNUTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Jelly doughnuts, popular in Israel, are served at Chanukah by
Shephardi Jews.
~ These doughnuts are filled with any type of jam (the jam is
injected into the doughnut after it has been deep-fried) and
dusted with sugar.
