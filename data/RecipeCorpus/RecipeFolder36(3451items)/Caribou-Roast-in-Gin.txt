Title: Caribou Roast in Gin
Categories: Game
Yield: 1 roast
1 md Parsnip; diced
2    Ribs celery; chopped
1 c  Cider Vinegar
1 c  Beef bouillon
1 c  Gin
1    Caribou roast
Strips of bacon
Marinade:
1 md Onion; chopped
6    Peppercorns
2 cl Garlic; minced
Combine all the marinade ingredients except the gin.  Bring to a boil
and simmer about 5 minutes, remove from the heat, add gin and cool.
Place roast in
marinade to cover. Let stand refrigerated for 48 hours or more.

Remove from the marinade; place on a roasting rack in a large
roasting pan and drape with bacon. Roast uncovered in a preheated 350
degree F. oven for 15
min per pound. Remove the bacon for the last 30 minutes of cooking and
baste
roast with the strained marinade and pan drippings.

Remove the roast and let sit 5-10 min before carving. With a little
butter and
flour make a gravy from the pan drippings and balance of the marinade.

The gin is juniper flavored alcohol and juniper is a traditional game
flavoring. The gin works quite well if you don't have any whole
juniper berries available.
