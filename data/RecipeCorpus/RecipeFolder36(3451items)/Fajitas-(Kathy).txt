Title: Fajitas (Kathy)

1.  Fajitas are properly made with skirt steak.  This is a cut of meat
taken from the diaphragm of the steer.  It is tough, stringy, and
requires careful trimming and marination to make it edible, but it
has an excellent, beefy flavor when properly prepared.  If this cut
of meat is not available in your area (and it probably isn't, as
there is only one diaphragm per steer, and I think all of them are
shipped to Texas), you may substitute flank steak.

2.  Fajitas are NOT properly made with chicken, shrimp, shark, or
whatever other yuppie meats the restaurant chooses to toss on the
grill.  If you must use these ingredients, please call the dish
something else ++ Mexican stir-fry, maybe?  This is, to quote Jeff
Smith "Peasant food, raised to glory..." and should not be
adulterated by the addition of wierd ingredients.

3.  Fajitas should properly be grilled outdoors, and accompanied by
grilled onions and peppers (preferably poblanos, but bell peppers may
be substituted).  Accompaniments are a good bowl of beans, some
homemade salsa, lime wedges, not much else.  Fresh, homemade
tortillas are essential, as are copious quantities of cervesa. In
short, this is the food of honest folks who worked hard, and ate
well, using the ingredients they had at hand (usually the meat that
the rich people wouldn't touch), and it's perfectly wonderful eating
all by itself -- without the addition of sour cream, goat cheese,
sun-dried tomatoes, etc.
