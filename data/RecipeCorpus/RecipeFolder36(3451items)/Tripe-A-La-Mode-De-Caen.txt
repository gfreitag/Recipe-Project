Title: Tripe A La Mode De Caen
Categories: French, Meats, Casseroles
Yield: 8 servings
3    Cloves
1    Bay leaf
1    Bouquet Garni*
1/4 c  Calvados*
Cider; or water, to cover
3 lb Fresh tripe
1    Calve's foot; split
2 lb Onions; sliced
1/4 lb Beef suet
1    Onion; stuck with
*Bouquet Garni: Tie in a bunch 3 sprigs each parsley and chervil with
2 sprigs fresh thyme. *Calvados is a French apple brandy. You may
substitute regular brandy and use cider instead of water.

Read about tripe. Trim, wash, soak, blanch, wash again, drain and cut
into 1 1/2" pieces. Wash and blanche a calve's foot. Peel and slice
the onions. Dice the suet.

Line the bottom of a casserole with a layer of onions, then a layer of
tripe and a sprinkling of suet. Continue to build layers and top with
the calve's foot and clove studded onion, a bay leaf and the bouquet
garni. Pour over this the Calvados or brandy and enough water or
cider to cover.

Bring just to a boil. Seal the casserole with a strip of pie pastry
dough and bake in a preheated 250 oven for 12 hours. When ready to
serve break the seal, remove the bouquet garni, bay leaf and whole
onion. Degrease the sauce and pick the meat from the calve's foot.
Return the meat to the casserole to heat through and serve in
preheated individual small casseroles with boiled parsley potatoes.

From the Joy of Cooking.

The New York Times Cook Book suggests the following variations: use 4
calve's feet, add carrots, leeks and celery, lots of coarse freshly
ground black pepper and 1/2 cup Calvados.
