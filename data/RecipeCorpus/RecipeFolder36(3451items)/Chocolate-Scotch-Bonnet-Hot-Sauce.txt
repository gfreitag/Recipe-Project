Title: Chocolate Scotch Bonnet Hot Sauce
Categories: Condiments, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 batch
1/2 ts Ground allspice
1/8 ts Salt (I actually used less)
1 tb Honey
4 ts Dutch cocoa powder
1 c  Dark rum
1/2 c  Fruity olive oil
18    Chocolate Scotch bonnets
-- seeded
1    Red Kishinev pepper; seeded
1    Garlic clove
-- peeled and sliced
1 ts Whole cumin
1 ts Whole coriander seed
In a dry pan, toast the cumin, coriander and garlic over high heat
(shaking the pan all the while) until the seeds begin to pop and smell
swell.  Remove from heat and grind with the salt in a mortar and
pestle until you almost have a paste.

Put the chiles, spice paste, allspice, honey, cocoa, rum and olive
oil in a food processor and puree.  When the sauce is quite smooth,
pour it into sterile glass bottles, cork and refrigerate.

Yield: About 2 pints.
