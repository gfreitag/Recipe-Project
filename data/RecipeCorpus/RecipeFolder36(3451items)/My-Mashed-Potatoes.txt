Title: My Mashed Potatoes
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables, Potatoes
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Margerine
Potato cooking water
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
1 lg Head garlic, split in
-half horizontally
1 ts Oil
Russet potatoes
Preheat oven to 350.  Drizzle garlic with oil.  Cover tightly with
foil and bake for 30-40 mins.  Let cool, then squeeze out garlic
(this can be done way in advance).

Cover potatoes with water (however many you'd like) and bring to a
boil. Cook 20-30 mins until fork tender.  Drain, reserving water.
Mash potatoes with margerine and garlic, adding enough potato water
back in to bring it to the desired consistency.
Add salt and pepper to taste.

My note:  I use up to 5# of potatoes, and then double the garlic.  I
also add chives at the very end and stir them in.  It's great if you
add in a yam/sweet potato or two into the mix of potatoes--adds a
nice color! I use the leftover gravy (made from seasoned, thickened
veg stock), leftoever potato water, peels from the potatoes and peels
from the garlic as a basis for the next pot of soup stock.
