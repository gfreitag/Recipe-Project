***** Lemon Glaze *****

Combine lemon juice and sugar in saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly,
for 1 minute or until syrupy. + I prefer more of a lemon flavor so I
just add a couple of Tbls. or so to suit our tastes. ++ I usually use
a butter knife and poke larger and longer holes (or poke knife into
cake and turn a tiny bit so the lemon juice glaze can get into the
cake lower)
