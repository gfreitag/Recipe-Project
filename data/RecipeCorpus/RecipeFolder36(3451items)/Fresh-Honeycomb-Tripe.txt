Categories: Meats, Spanish

4    Peppercorns
Salt
1/2 ts Mustard
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
2 lb Fresh honeycomb tripe
;water to cover

Read "About Tripe". Trim, wash, soak, wash and drain the tripe. Cut it
into 2" squares. In a heavy pot with a tight fitting lid add enough
water to cover the tripe and the seasonings. Bring to a boil and THEN
add the tripe. Reduce heat immediately. Seal the lid with a strip of
pie pastry dough and simmer 12 hours.

When the tripe is tender serve it with pan gravy seasoned with salt,
mustard and Worcestershire sauce.

Or finish Spanish style by simmering 1/2 hour more with a cup of
tomato puree and a dash of cayenne. In the last 15 minutes add 1/2
cup each cooked minced ham and sliced mushrooms. Serve over steamed
rice.
