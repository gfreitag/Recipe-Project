Lime gravad lax with a salad of watercress, pear and chervil.

FOR THE GRAVAD LAX:

The day before:  remove any small bones that may be in the salmon
with a pair of tweezers and trim any fat or fins.  Mix together the
sugar, salt, pepper and lime zest.  Rub the flesh of the salmon with
vodka and spread sugar mixture evenly over.  Wrap in clingfilm, place
in a shallow dish and cover with a heavily weighted plate.  Leave in
the fridge for 24 hours, turning once.
To prepare the salad:  thinly slice the cured salmon, just as for
smoked salmon, leaving a pale green edge on each slice.  Spread out
on sheets of clingfilm, cover and refrigerate.  Make up the lime
vinaigrette with 1tbsp lime juice to 3tbsps olive oil and season to
taste.  You can add a shot of poire william if you wish and a pinch
of sugar.  Prepare the pear and toss in plenty of lime juice to
prevent it from discolouring.  Wash the watercress, leaving it in
small sprigs and mix with the endive leaves and sprigs of chervil.
Cover and store at the bottom of the fridge.  When ready to serve
toss the salad leaves in the vinaigrette and place on plates.
Interweave with slices of salmon and pear.
