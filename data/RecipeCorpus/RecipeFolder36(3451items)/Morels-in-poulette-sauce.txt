Categories: Salsa/sauce, Guestchefs, Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE:--------------------------------
3    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Heavy cream
Salt and pepper
3 1/2 c  Chicken broth
3 tb Butter
3 tb Flour
MMMMM-------------------------MUSHROOMS:------------------------------
3 tb Butter
1 lb Morels, trimmed, washed,
-squeezed dry.
MMMMM-------------------------FINISHING:------------------------------
Salt and pepper
Fresh ground nutmeg
2 tb Chopped parsley
1 ts Lemon juice or to taste
3    More egg yolks
1 c  Chicken broth
1/4 c  Chopped mushrooms, any kind
3 tb Butter
Reduce the broth by half. Strain. Mix the butter and flour over low
heat, stirring for a couple of minutes but making sure the flour does
not brown. Whisk in 1/4 c broth and then gradually add the rest. Cook
10 min. Turn off heat. Beat yolks and cream together and stir into
the sauce. Bring sauce slowly to the boil and immediately take it off
the heat. Season with pepper; unless you used salt-free broth, you
probably don't need salt.

Melt butter over medium heat. Add mushrooms. Turn heat to high and
cook 2 min. Reduce heat to minimum and cook covered 5 min. Remove
mushrooms to a hot platter and reserve braising liquid.

Put the rest of the egg yolks into a large heavy saucepan. Stir in
broth and the sauce already made. Blend well and cook over low heat.
Add chopped mushrooms, all at once, and stir in. Add cooked mushroom
liquid. Stir in butter a teaspoon at a time. Cook until thick and
strain. Season with pepper, nutmeg to taste, parsley and lemon juice.
Taste for salt and add any if necessary.

Pour finished sauce over mushrooms and serve with toast.
