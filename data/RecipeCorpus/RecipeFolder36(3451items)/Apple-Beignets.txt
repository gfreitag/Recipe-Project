Categories: Desserts, Cajun/creol, Breads, Pcake/waffl
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Applejack
2 lg Apples; peeled, quartered,
-cored and thick sliced
Juice of 1/2 lemon
MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
2 tb Melted sweet butter
-vegetable oil for deep
Frying
2    Egg whites
1 c  Sifted flour
1 pn Salt
2 ts Sugar
1/3 c  Apple cider
-a little water
Place the sliced apples in a bowl and sprinkle with lemon juice,
sugar and liquor. Toss lightly.  Cover and marinate for 40 or 50
minutes. Batter: In a bowl combine the flour, salt and sugar.  Add
the cider and incorporate it into the flour.  Do not over beat, just
blend it in. Add just enough water to give the batter the consistency
of heavy cream. Add the melted butter and let the batter stand for 40
minutes to 1 hour. Heat the oil (to the depth of 3 inches) in a large
skillet.  You do not need a deep fryer. While the oil is getting hot,
beat the egg whites and add them to the batter. Drain the apple
pieces and dip them into the batter. Drop 4 to 6 at a time into the
hot fat and fry them until they are nicely browned. Drain the
beignets on paper towels and sprinkle with lots of confectioners'
sugar. Serve immediately.
