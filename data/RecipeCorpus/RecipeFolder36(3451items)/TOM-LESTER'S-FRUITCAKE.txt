Makes 8 - 8 inch loaves.
Prepare fruits and nuts as desired. Beat eggs in mixer. Begin
creaming the butter. While butter is creaming, add just enough flour
to the fruits and nuts to give each a thin coating so it won't stick
to its neighbor.
When the butter is properly creamed, add eggs, sugar, molasses and
soda, spices, remaining flour, vanilla and brandy. Let mixer go to
work on that.
Scoop a depression in the top of the fruit-nut pile and pour the
batter over it. Then mix and knead almost like you would knead bread.
Pack into 8 (8") well-buttered foil loaf pans which have been lined
with foil or brown paper and buttered. Place in a 225 degree oven
with a shallow pan of water below them.
If the oven temperature is right, they should be done in 3 to 4 hours.
After 1-1/2 hours watch them carefully, and if the edges begin to
crisp before the to cracks in numerous breaks, turn the heat down and
put in a fresh pan of cool water. When little cracks come across the
tops of the cakes they are done.
When cool, remove them from the pans. When cold dab whiskey or brandy
liberally over the outside. Wrap each separately in wax paper, then in
aluminum foil. Cover with newspaper and set away to age in a cool
place. This aging takes about a month; the alcohol will have
evaporated by then and have left only the bouquet and flavor.
