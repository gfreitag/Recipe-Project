Title: Jamaican Patties
Categories: Meats, Pie/tart, Caribbean
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 ml Thyme
1 ml Pepper
50 ml Bread crumbs
125 ml Water
1/2 lg Onion
250 ml Ground beef
2 ml Salt
2 ml Curry powder
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
1 ml Turmeric
75 ml Shortening
25 ml Butter
75 ml Cold water
250 ml All-purpose flour
5 ml Baking powder
2 ml Curry powder
1 ml Salt
Ingredient note: the 75ml shortening and 25ml butter may be replaced
with 100ml of Golden Crisco [yellow label package]. If you like spicy
food, you may want to add chopped fresh chili pepper the way most
Jamaicans do.

1. Peel the onion; then chop it into small pieces. Place it in a
frying pan with the ground beef and cook over medium heat until the
meat is browned, about 5-10 minutes. Stir the meat frequently.

2. Add the salt, curry powder, thyme and pepper. Cook and stir for 1
minute. Add the bread crumbs and stir; then add the water. Cook over
low heat for another 2-3 minutes. The mixture should not be watery.
Set aside.

3. Measure the flour, baking powder, curry powder, salt and turmeric
into a large bowl.

4. Add the shortening and butter (or substitute), cutting them into
the flour mixture with a pastry blender or 2 knives until it
resembles course crumbs.

5. Add the cold water, stirring with a fork until you have a ball of
dough formed. Divide it into 8 equal portions and set aside.

6. Set the oven to 180C. You'll need a small glass of water and about
50ml of flour to assemble the patties.

7. Sprinkle a little flour (about 15ml) on a wooden board and on the
rolling pin. Take one portion of dough and flatten it between your
hands; then roll it out to a thin circle about 16cm in diameter.

8. Space a scoop (40-50ml) of the meat mixture on the pastry circle.
Dip your fingers into the glass of water and moisten the edges of the
dough. Fold the circle in half, covering the meat, and press the
edges together with a fork. [The TV advertised patty presses work
well for this process]

9. You now have a half-moon shape that can be trimmed cleanly with a
knife if the edges are a little ragged. Prick through the top crust
of the patty with a fork and place the patty on a baking sheet.
Continue making the rest of the patties in the same manner,
sprinkling more flour on the board if the dough begins to stick.

10. Bake for 25-30 minutes until the crust is cooked and lightly
browned. Serve hot or cold.
