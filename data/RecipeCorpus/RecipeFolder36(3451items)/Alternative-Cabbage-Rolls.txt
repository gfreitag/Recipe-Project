Bring water & salt to a boil in a pot large enough to hold the whole
head of cabbage.  When it boils, place the whole cabbage in the pot &
poach it until the outer leaves can be pulled away without tearing.
Set aside 8 large leaves with no holes in them.

Place bulgur in a bowl & pour boiling water over.  Fluff with a fork
& set aside until all the water has been absorbed.  Fluff
occasionally.  When the water has been absorbed, mix in the ground
pine nuts.

Heat oil in a skillet.  Saute the onion, garlic & carrots over a low
heat for about 5 minutes.  Be careful not to overcook the vegetables,
but you do need them to be soft.  Stir in the herbs & the paprika &
saute for a few minutes longer.  Mix in the soy sauce & cook for
another minute. Remove from the heat & mix into the prepared
bulgur-pine nut mixture. Stir well, grind in black pepper & check the
seasoning.

Place an eighth of the filling on each cabbage leaf & roll up,
folding in the sides as you roll, ensuring that you have a tight
roll.  Transfer to a large baking dish, lightly oiled.

Put all the sauce ingredients in a food processor & puree into a light
sauce.  Pour over the cabbage rolls.  Cover with foil & bake in a
preheated oven at 350F for 40 minutes.  Serve over rice.
