Categories: Snacks, Caribbean
Yield: 40 pieces
1 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
2 c  Sugar or as needed
1 1/2 lb Fresh tamarind pods
(abt 2 cups peeled pulp)
1    Garlic clove(s), minced
1 ts Salt
Shell the tamarind pods and remove any strings from the pulp. Place
the pulp in a mixing bowl. Add the garlic, salt and pepper, cayenne,
and 1 cup sugar or to taste. Knead together with your fingers to make
a dough-like mixture.

Pinch off 1-inch pieces of the tamarind mixture and roll them into
smooth balls between the palms of your hands.. Place the remaining 1
cup sugar in a shallow bowl. Roll the tamarind balls in sugar until
thoroughly coated, shaking off the excess.

Store the tamarind balls in an airtight container, leaving a little
space between each ball. Place a sheet of waxed paper between layers.
Stored in a cool, dry place, tamarind balls will keep for several
months.

Warn eaters to nibble around the seeds.
