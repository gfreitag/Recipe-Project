Title: Kathy Pitts' Eggplant
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 batch  Try slicing the eggplant in half inch slices, then covering each
slice with a generous amount of salt, and placing it in a sieve.
Place a heavy weight (one of your cast iron skillets would be about
right) on top, and let it sit and drip for about an hour.  (Longer
would be even better). This removes the astringent tasting juices
that many people don't care for.

Rinse the eggplant very well to remove the salt.  Bread the slices by
dipping them in flour, egg, then flour or breadcrumbs.  Fry in hot
olive oil until brown.  (You'll be amazed at the amount of oil this
requires -- eggplant absorbs the stuff like a sponge.)

Now layer the eggplant in a casserole, and cover with a good garlicy
homemade tomato sauce, and a generous handful of grated mozarella and
Parmesan cheese.  Place in a 350 oven, and bake until the cheese is
melted and slightly browned.

Even Wes, who thinks he hates eggplant, will eat it this way.

He also likes it brushed with a little olive oil (herb-flavored oil is
better, basil-flavored oil is best), and grilled, IF I give it the
salt treatment first.
