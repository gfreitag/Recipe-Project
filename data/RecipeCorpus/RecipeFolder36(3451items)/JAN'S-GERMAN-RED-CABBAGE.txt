Title: JAN'S GERMAN RED CABBAGE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
20    Cloves
2    Apples
1 ts Lemon juice
1    Red cabbage
1/4 lb Bacon; sliced
1    Onion
Cut up the bacon into little Â«-inch pieces and fry slowly in the
bottom of a large pot while you... Peel the onion and stab the cloves
into it (15-30 cloves).
Put the onion into the pot and let it warm with the bacon while
you... Cut up the cabbage into roughly bite-sized chunks - somewhat
thicker slices than for slaw.
Put the cabbage in the pot and add enough water to about
half-cover the cabbage; then turn the heat up high. But don't go away!
Quarter, core and peel the apples. Toss them in on top of the
cabbage with a small handful (about a 1/2 teaspoon) of salt. Sprinkle
the lemon juice over it all.
By this time the water should be boiling. Turn down the heat and
put a lid on the pot.
Go away and let it cook for 10 minutes. Stir 'n sniff. Cover and
let it cook another 10 minutes.
Now you can serve it "as is", or you can ladle out part of the
liquid, thicken it with cornstarch or arrow-root, and stir it back in.
