Title: Annatto Oil
Categories: Caribbean
Yield: 2 cups
20    Black peppercorns
1    Scotch bonnet or
2    Jalapeno peppers
Quartered and seeded
2 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Annatto seeds
Optional Ingredients
8    Garlic clove(s)
Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat.

Add the annatto seeds, garlic, peppercorns, and chilies and cook
until the oil is reddish gold and the annatto seeds begin to crackle,
3-5 min. Do not overcook or the oil will become bitter. Remove the
pan from the heat and strain the oil into a heatproof bowl to cool.

Transfer the oil to a clean glass bottle. Store away form heat and
light. Keeps at room temperature for several months.

Variation for Annatto Butter: Prepare recipe using clarified butter
instead of olive oil.

Note: Annatto is a rust-colored seed native to the Caribbean. Other
names include achiote and roucou. Look for it in Hispanic and West
Indian markets. It has a mild, earthy flavor with an iodine tang that
reminds some people of oysters.
