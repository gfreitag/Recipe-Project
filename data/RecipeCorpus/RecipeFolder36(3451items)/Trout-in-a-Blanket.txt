You will probably need a grill basket for this recipe. Marinate the
fish by combining marinade ingreds. Place marinade and fish in a
well-sealed baggie and let sit at room temp. for 1 hour. Turn several
times so that marinade will touch fish inside and out.  Remove fish
from marinade and lightly pat outsides of fish with paper towels.
Salt and pepper insides of fish well, then put 2 slices of crisply
cooked bacon inside each fish. Wrap each fish completely in
half-cooked bacon, using 5 slices per fish. Fasten bacon strips with
round wooden toothpicks. Arrange fish in a grill basket. Place grill
basket on prepared grill and cook for about 5 minutes on each side or
until brown. Bacon should be crisp. Transfer fish to serving platter
and serve. Pass lemon wedges. Gourmet Fish on the Grill formatted by
