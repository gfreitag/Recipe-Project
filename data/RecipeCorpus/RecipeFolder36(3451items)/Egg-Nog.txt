Title: Egg Nog
Categories: Beverages, Cheese/eggs, Alcohol
Yield: 30 servings
1 qt Heavy cream
2 qt Milk
1 qt Vanilla ice cream
Nutmeg
24    Eggs, separated
2 c  Sugar
1 qt Bourbon
2 c  Brandy
Beat egg yolks and sugar until thick. Add Bourbon and Brandy and stir
thoroughly. (The liquor "cooks" the eggs.) Add cream and milk and
continue whipping. Break up the ice cream and add. Beat egg whites
until stiff and fold in. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before
serving. Sprinkle lightly with nutmeg.

NOTE: This is fairly potent and deceptively smooth, so you might wish
to cut back on the Bourbon and Brandy a little.
