Title: HOT PEPPER SALSA
Categories: Chilies, Tex/mexican, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 999 servings
64 oz Catsup (2 bottles)
1 lb Brown Sugar
1 c  Dark Cider Vinegar
1 lb Banana Peppers (hot)
1 lb Green Bell Peppers
2    Large Onions
1    Bulb of Garlic
Grind together peppers, onion and garlic. Blend together catsup, brown
sugar, and vinegar. Stir well and boil 20 minutes.

Pack hot and seal

Note:  I use the cheapest catsup I can get at a warehouse grocery
store. This BURNS EASIL! So keep heat low and stir often
prior to canning.
