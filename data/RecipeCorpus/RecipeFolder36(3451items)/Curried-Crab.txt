Title: Curried Crab
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Curries, Caribbean
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Thyme, fresh or dried
1 1/2 c  Coconut milk
Salt and pepper
2 tb Cilantro
Or flat-leaf parsley
Finely chopped
1 lb Backfin lump crab meat
1 tb Butter or oil
1 lg Onion(s), finely chopped
(abt 1 1/2 cups)
2    Garlic clove(s), minced
2 ts Ginger, minced
2 ts (to 3 tsp) curry powder
Pick through the crab meat, removing any pieces if cartilage or shell.

Melt the butter in a large saute pan. Add the onion, garlic, and
ginger and cook over medium-low heat until soft but not brown, 5-7
min. Add the curry powder and thyme and saute for 1 min. Stir in the
coconut milk, salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat
and simmer for 3-5 min, or until well flavored and slightly thickened.

Stir in the crab meat and gently simmer for 5 min, adding salt and
pepper to taste. Stir in the dumplings and cook until thoroughly
heated (I didn't include the recipe). Sprinkle with parsley or
cilantro and serve.

Notes: This is one of the national dishes of Trinidad and Tobago. It's
traditionally made with land crabs which are almost impossible to buy
in the U.S. If you're using whole crabs, you'll need 4 large blue
crabs or 2 Dungeness crabs.

If using blue crabs, boil them for 1 min. Remove the carapace, gills,
and entrails and cut the crab bodies in half, leaving the legs
attached.

If using Dungeness crabs, which are usually sold cooked, remove the
carapace, gills and entrails, and cut the crab bodies in quarters,
again with the legs intact.

Curried crab is usually served with dumplings.
