Title: Heidi's Potatoes with Portobellos
Categories: Potatoes
Yield: 4 servings
Salt
2 lg Portobellos, cleaned
6 oz Boursin cheese or
Other herbed cream cheese
3 md (to 4) red new potatoes
5 tb Olive oil
2 tb Minced garlic
10 oz Fresh spinach
Preheat oven to 425 F.

Place potatoes in a pot of lightly salted water. Bring to a boil and
cook until very tender when pierced with a fork, about 30 min.

While potatoes are cooking, place 3 tbs oil in a skillet over medium
heat. Add 1 tbs garlic and saute for 1 min. Add spinach and stir
until it begins to wilt. When spinach is fully wilted, add salt to
taste. Spread sauteed spinach over the bottom of a 12-inch glass
baking dish.

Remove stems from mushrooms and cut caps into  1/2-inch pieces. Slices
stems into  1/2-inch-wide pieces. Add remaining oil and garlic to
skillet and saute for 1 min. Add sliced mushroom stems and caps and
saute over medium-high heat. Saute until most of the liquid has
evaporated and the mushrooms have turned nearly black, about 4 min.
Add salt to taste.

When potatoes are tender, remove them from the  water and slice into
1/2-inch-thick pieces while still warm. Layer potatoes over spinach
and lightly salt this layer.

Layer mushrooms over potatoes. Break up    the cheese as much as
possible scatter over mushrooms. Place the dish, uncovered, in the
oven and bake for 20 min. Remove dish and spread the cheese carefully
over the mushrooms with a spatula. This is not a melting cheese, so
you must spread it when you remove it warm from the oven. Serve
immediately.
