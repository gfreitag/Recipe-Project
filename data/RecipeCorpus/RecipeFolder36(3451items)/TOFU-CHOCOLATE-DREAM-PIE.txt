In a food processor whip tofu until smooth. Heat honey 90
Banana
:
seconds in microwave on medium high. Pour honey over cocoa
powder-stir until smooth. Add vanilla. Add chocolate mixture to tofu
and continue blending for one minute. Pour into pre-made pie shell or
custard cups and chill for 1 to 2 hours. Garnish with banana slices.
Mikenote: any berry or nut extract can be used to flavor this pie
but be aware that tofu carries the flavors very well, so be light
handed with any flavor additions.
Mikenote two: I have used the "Oreo" pre-prepared crusts and
the graham cracker pre-prepared crusts with success.....
