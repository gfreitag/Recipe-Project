This table is found in the back of Chef Tell Tells All by Tell Erhardt
which I found at the local library. Publisher is Schiffer Publishing
Limited Box E Exton Pa 19341. Copyright 1979 ISBN 0-916838-27-7. Hope
that you can all use it.

This is appropriate since I am posting it after reading the recipe for
British Christmas Cake.  Here are the weights American to Metric.
They are approximate so you can fudge a little bit.
