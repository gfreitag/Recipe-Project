Grease 5 wide-mouth pint canning jars.  Divide dough evenly between
jars. (Jars will be slightly over 1/2 full.)  Bake at 325 degrees for
50 minutes.  Pull jars out of oven 1 at a time.  Pour glaze over hot
bread. Immediately apply and firmly tighten a two-piece wide-mouth
canning lid.

The lid will form a vacuum seal as the jar cools. Jars of canned
bread may be stored on the pantry shelf with other canned foods or
may be placed in a freezer.  The bread is safe to eat as long as jars
remain vacuum sealed and free of mold growth.
