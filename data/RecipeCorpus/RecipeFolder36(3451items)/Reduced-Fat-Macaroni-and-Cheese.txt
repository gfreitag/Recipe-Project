Categories: Main dish, Low cal/fat, Pasta/rice, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper, ground black
1/4 ts Nutmeg ground
1/4 c  Cheese, parmesan grated
8 oz Macaroni, elbow twists
16 oz Cottage cheese, low-fat 1%
2 tb Flour, all-purpose
2 c  Skim milk
4 oz Cheese, sharp cheddar shred
"They'll never know we sneaked out 10 grams of fat per serving because
this macaroni and cheese is as good as - even BETTER than - the
old-favorite recipe."

Beginning about 45 minutes before serving:

1.  Prepare macaroni as label directs but do not add salt to water;
drain. 2.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Spray shallow,
broiler-safe, 2
1/2-quart casserole with nonstick cooking spray.
3.  In food processor with knife blade attached, blend cottage cheese
until smooth.  (Or, in blender at high speed, blend cottage
cheese with
1/4 cup of the milk called for in recipe, for easier blending.)
4.  In 2-quart saucepan, mix flour with 1/4 cup milk until smooth.
Slowly
stir in remaining cups milk until blended.  Cook over medium heat
until
mixture just boils and thickens slightly, stirring frequently.
Remove
saucepan from heat; stir in cottage cheese, Cheddar, salt, pepper
and
nutmeg.
5.  Place macaroni in casserole; cover with cheese sauce.  Bake,
uncovered, 20 minutes.
6.  Remove casserole from oven.  Turn oven control to broil.  Sprinkle
Parmesan cheese on top of macaroni mixture.
7.  Place casserole in broiler at closest position to source of heat;
broil 2 to 3 minutes until top is golden brown.

This recipe which I've made and enjoyed, comes from the September 1995
issue of Good Housekeeping.
