Yield: 12 servings
Butter; bacon or lard
2 c  ;water
1/2 lb Lebkuchen; grated*
1    Leg of fresh pork; boned,
-rolled and tied
Fresh ground black pepper
Salt
* Lebkuchen are Nurnberg's famed honey cakes.

Rub the tied leg of pork generously with pepper. place on a platter,
cover with foil or waxed paper and keep in a refrigerator two days.
Salt roast on all sides. if the pork has a good deal of fat around
it, it can be browned without adding any more. Otherwise heat lard,
butter or bacon in a Dutch oven and when hot, add pork. Brown well on
all sides, about 15 min. Turn the roast with the string; do not
pierce with a fork. Add water, cover pan tightly and simmer slowly
2-2 1/2 hrs or until tender when pierced with a fork or skewer.

Lay pork on a rack in the roasting pan; cover top and sides with 1/3
of the lebkuchen crumbs. Roast in a 450 oven until crumbs turn golden
brown. Baste with the sauce in which the pork was braised and cover
with another layer of crumbs. Brown, baste, add more crumbs and
brown again until a thick crust forms. Serve with gravy made adding
the braising juices to the roasting pan. It will thicken from any
crumbs that have dropped off the roast. Season the gravy and serve
over the sliced meat. From: The German Cookbook by Mimi Sheraton,
