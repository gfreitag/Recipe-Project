In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the
onion and saute until soft, about 4 min. Add the garam masala, bay
leaf, and apples, and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 min more. Add
the lentils and stock and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a
simmer and cook for about 25 min or until the lentils are tender,
being careful not to overcook them. Remove the pan from the heat,
remove the bay leaf, and adjust the seasoning to taste.

Serve the lentils hot in one large serving bowl. Serve the yogurt and
apple crisps separately to be combined to diners individual tastes.

Apple Crisps:
Preheat the oven to its lowest setting.

In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in the lemon juice. Thinly slice
the apples horizontally into rounds about 1/16-inch thick. Lay the
apple slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush
lightly with the sugared lemon juice. Place the baking sheet in the
oven and allow the apples to dry for 3-4 hours or overnight.

Remove the baking sheet from the oven and gently peel the apple
slices from the paper. Store in an airtight container until ready to
use. They will last for 2 days in the refrigerator.

Curried Yogurt:
Heat a small non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the curry powder
and toast until you can smell its intense aroma, about 30 seconds.
Remove pan from heat.

Combine the curry powder with the banana and yogurt in a serving bowl,
stirring well. Refrigerate until ready to use.

Makes 2 cups.
