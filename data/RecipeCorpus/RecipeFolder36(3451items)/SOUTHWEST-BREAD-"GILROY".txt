1/4 c  Oil Packed Sun Dried Tomato
-drained and chopped
1 tb Chili Powder
3 tb Anaheim Chile; seeded, diced
3 tb Margarine; melted
1 tb Jalapeno Pepper; seeded,
-minced
1 ts Salt
1 ts Cumin; ground
1/2 ts Tarragon flavored Vinegar
4 1/2 c  Bread Flour; divided
Vegetable Cooking Spray
1 1/2 c  Whole Wheat Flour
1 1/2 c  Yellow Cornmeal
1 pk Dry yeast; (2 1/4 ts)
2 c  Very Warm Water 120 to 130d
3/4 c  Plain low-fat Yogurt
1/2 c  Honey
1 c  Black beans; drained
1/2 c  Frozen Whole-Kernel Corn

1/2 c  Red Onion; chopped
1/4 c  Fresh Cilantro; chopped
1/4 c  Garlic; chopped
Combine first 3 ingredients in a large bowl; stir. Add water,
yogurt, and honey; stir. Let stand 30 minutes. Add beans and next 12
ingredients (bean through vinegar); stir. Stir in 4 1/2 cups bread
flour to form a soft dough.
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead until smooth and
elastic (about 8 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1
tablespoon at a time, to prevent the dough from sticking to hands.
Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to
coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85F degrees), free from
drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk.
Punch dough down. Divide dough into 4 equal portions, and shape
each portion into a 6-inch round loaf. Place loaves 4 inches apart on
large baking sheets coated with cooking spray. Make 4 (1/8-inch-deep)
diagonal cuts across tops of loaves. Dust loaves with flour. Cover
and let rise 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Bake at 375F
degrees for 25 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped; let
cool on wire racks.
