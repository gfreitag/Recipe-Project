30g fresh yeast (or 2 sachets, 14g, dried yeast)
3 1/2 tablespoons caster sugar
6 egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla essence
Finely grated rind of 1 orange
Finely grated rind of 1 lemon
250g (1 2/3 cups) plain flour
125g butter, softened
100g (2/3 cup) currants 110g (2/3 cup) sultanas
2 glace apricots finely chopped
2 glace figs, finely chopped
Melted butter

Crumble yeast into a small bowl.  Add 3 tablespoons lukewarm water and
sprinkle with 1 teaspoon caster sugar.  Stand for 2-3 minutes, then
stir to dissolve completely.  Cover with plastic wrap and stand in a
warm, draught-free place for 5-10 minutes, or until frothy. Combine
egg yolks, vanilla, rinds, remaining sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt, add
yeast mixture and mix well.  Gradually add flour, stirring
constantly, until mixture forms a sticky dough.  Turn out on a
lightly floured surface and knead for 2-3 minutes, incorporating more
flour only if necessary - dough should be quite sticky.  Using
fingertips, gradually work in small pieces of softened butter. Knead
dough for 8-10 minutes longer, or until smooth and shiny.

Place in a well-oiled bowl, turn to coat with oil, cover with plastic
wrap and stand in a warm, draught-free place for 1-1 1/2 hours, or
until doubled in bulk.  Punch down dough and gently knead in fruit.
Divide dough into 8 equal portions and place in buttered 1/2-cup
souffle dishes. Cover with a dry tea-towel and stand in a warm place
for about 30 minutes, or until doubled in bulk.

Brush top of each panetone with melted butter and bake in the centre
of the oven at 200C: for 10 minutes.  Reduce temperature to 180C,
brush again with melted butter and bake for 25-30 minutes longer or
until cooked through and the tops are golden.  Turn out on a wire
rack to cool. Serve as an accompaniment to poached fruits and cream,
spread with fresh soft cheese, or cut in wedges to dip in coffee or
liqueur. Panettone can be kept in an airtight container for up to a
week. Bon Appetit, Exec. Chef Magnus Johansson
