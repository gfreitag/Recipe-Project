TURKEY

Combine 1 quart water with 1/2 cup vinegar. Rinse turkey in vinegar
mixture, drain well and soak in remaining quart water mixed with lemon
juice. Drain well and pat dry.
Loosen skin over turkey breast with fingers, starting at neck
opening and moving toward tail. Be careful not to tear skin.
Rub salt into bird cavity, over skin and between skin and flesh. Put
softened butter under skin covering breast.
Combine garlic, pepper, oregano, poultry seasoning and olive oil in
bowl. Place bird in non-reactive container. Rub skin all over with
garlic marinade and dribble with remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar.
Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Next day, remove bird from refrigerator 1 hour before roasting. Just
before roasting, stuff bird partly through neck opening with Picadillo
Stuffing. Sew shut with cotton thread or secure with skewers. Stuff
bird through tail 3/4 full to allow for expansion. Sew or skewer shut.
Truss bird. Rub turkey all over with oil or melted butter. Place
turkey breast-side down on rack in roasting pan. Pour stock and
chopped onion into pan.
Roast turkey at 325 degrees, basting often, until nicely browned and
thermometer inserted into deepest part of thigh reads 175 degrees (155
degrees. Manny), about 15 minutes per pound. Halfway through, turn
bird over and continue roasting. Remove from oven and let stand 30
minutes before carving.

PICADILLO STUFFING

Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown pork slightly
and add salt. Remove to separate bowl and set aside.
Discard all but 1 tablespoon browning oil. Reduce heat to

Add olives, capers, pimientos and their liquid and cook 5 minutes.
Add raisins and reserved pork. Cook, uncovered, 15 minutes, stirring
occasionally.
Remove pan from heat. Add applesauce and eggs. Mix well. Stuffing
may be made day ahead. Refrigerate or freeze if not using
immediately. Do not stuff turkey until just before roasting.
