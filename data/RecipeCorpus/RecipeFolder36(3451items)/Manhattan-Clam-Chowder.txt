Title: Manhattan Clam Chowder
Categories: Soup/stew, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 3 /4
Clam juice
Whole tomatoes (At least 2
-quarts), mashed
Lots of thyme (fresh is
-best)
3    Dozen hard clams
Salt pork or bacon
Onions chopped
Stalks of sliced celery
Potatoes, cubed
Open the clams and save the juice.  Chop them up.  Cook the salt pork
or bacon in the bottom of the soup pot.  Take out when rendered.
Cook the onions and celery in the fat until soft and lightly colored.
Add the clam juice, canned or fresh whole tomatoes and thyme.  Add
potatoes and cook until tender.  Add the chopped clams and simmer a
while longer.  If the flavor isn't strong enough add more thyme and
tomatoes.  Put back the crumbled bacon.

A monster size can of chopped clams and another of clam broth can be
used instead of fresh.  The amounts of vegetables don't matter a lot.
