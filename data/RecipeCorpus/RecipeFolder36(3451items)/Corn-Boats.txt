I've found that this recipe works with many different kinds of
cheeses, including Fontanella and plain sharp cheddar.

Pull a lengthwise strip of corn husk (about 1 to 1-1/2 inches wide)
from each ear to expose kernels and discard husk strip.  Carefully
peel back remaining husks, keeping them attached to stem ends, and
snap ear from stem end.  Discard silk from husks.  Tear a thin strip
from a tender inner piece of each husk and use it tie loose end of
each husk together, forming a boat.  Cut corn kernels from ears and
discard cobs.

In a large skillet saute corn in 4 Tblsp butter over moderately high
heat, stirring, until just tender, about 5 min.  Stir in coriander,
Tabasco, mayonnaise, lime juice, and 2-3/4 cups cheese,
stirring until cheese is melted.  Remove skillet from heat and season
mixture with salt and pepper.

In a small skillet saute bread crumbs in remaining 1-1/4 Tblsp butter
over moderately high heat, stirring, until golden brown, about
2 min.

Preheat broiler.

Brush insides of husk boats lightly with oil.  Divide corn mixture
among husks.  Top corn mixture with bread crumbs and remaining 1/4
cup cheese. Put filled husks on a baking sheet and broil about 4
inches from heat until cheese is melted and tops are browned lightly,
about 2 min. Serves 6.
