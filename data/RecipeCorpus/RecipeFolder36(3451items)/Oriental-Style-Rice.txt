It always seems amazing that the production of great rice is so
difficult for Americans.  We do two things to rice in this part of
the world to ruin it.  One, we put oil in the water when we cook it.
Two, we salt it.  The butter causes the rice to separate but it makes
cooking times troublesome. The salt?  We just do that because we like
salt.

This recipe produces a nice sticky, chinese style rice using American
long rice.  Edible with chop sticks.

The most important thing in making good rice is the pan that you make
it in.  A heavy bottomed pan with a heavy lid is best.  This allows
the rice to steam properly.  Good quality rice won't hurt either.

Place the rice and the water in the pan.  Allow to sit off of the
heat for at least a half hour or as long as an hour before cooking.
Turn the heat on high with the lid on the pan.  When the water starts
to boil, the heavy lid will rattle.  Reduce the heat so that the lid
just dances slightly on the top of the pan.  DON'T PEEK.  Leave the
lid on the pan.  Cook at this light boil for 17 minutes.  Remove from
heat.  DON'T PEEK.  Allow the rice to sit for 15 minutes.  Serve.
