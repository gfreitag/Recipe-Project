Categories: Fruit, Pie/tart, Desserts
Yield: 20 servings
-cornstarch
1 c  Brown sugar substitute

2    To 3  tablespoons
MMMMM-----------------------TOPPING - - -----------------------------
1/2 c  Brown sugar substitute
1/2 c  Melted margarine
1 c  Graham cracker crumbs
2 tb Cinnamon
TOPPING:  Mix the crushed graham crackers, 2 Tsp. of cinnamon, and
the brown sugar or substitute together.  Stir in the melted
margarine and set the mixture to one side.

FILLER:  Mix the sliced apples, 5 Tsp. of cinnamon, corn starch, and 1
cup of brown sugar or substitute together and pour into a 13" x 9"
pan. Sprinkle on the topping and pat down.  Bake 35 minutes in an oven
preheated to 350 degrees.  Let cool and enjoy!!

* * * NOTE * * * When using sugar substitute in the filler, leave out
the corn starch.  In my experience, for some reason, when using brown
sugar substitute corn starch is not need as a thickener.

FOR DIABETICS:  When made with brown sugar substitute, a 2"
square has 2 bread and one fat exchange.
