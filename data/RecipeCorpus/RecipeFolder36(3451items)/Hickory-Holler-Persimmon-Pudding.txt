Title: Hickory Holler Persimmon Pudding
Categories: Puddings, Fruit, Herbs/spice
Yield: 2 cups
1 c  Buttermilk
1 ts Baking soda
1/3 c  Melted butter or margarine
1 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 c  Sugar
2 ea Eggs, beaten
1 3/4 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 c  Half and half
In a large bowl, combine the persimmon pulp, sugar, and eggs.  In a
separate bowl sift the flour with the baking powder.  In a small bowl,
combine the half and half and the buttermilk, and add the baking soda.
Add the flour mixture to the persimmon mixture alternately with the
buttermilk mixture, stirring well after each addition.  Place the
butter in a 9x13 inch cake pan and place in a 325F oven until melted.
Using a pastry brush, coat the sides of the pan.  Pour the excess
butter into the batter.  Add the cinnamon and vanilla, and mix well.
Pour into the pan.  Bake in a 325F oven for 1 hour or until a table
knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  The pudding will puff
up and then flatten as it cooks.  **Variations** Some cooks add nuts,
raisins, or coconut before baking.**
