"You can add sesame and sunflower seeds and coconut to these (to
imitate Nature Classics from Confectionately Yours). I found
refrigerating them made them easier to cut."
Anne's note: the one's I've tried had dried apricots, sunflower seeds
and coconut in them (like an upscale Rice Krispie).

Combine dates, almonds, apricots and orange rind, set aside. In large,
heavy saucepan over low heat, melt butter. Stir in corn syrup and
sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until sugar is
dissolved and mixture comes to a full boil. Remove from heat, stir in
vanilla. Add cereal and fruit-nut mixture, stirring till evenly
coated. Press mixture firmly into greased 9 inch square pan. When
partially cool, cut into bars. Cool completely.
