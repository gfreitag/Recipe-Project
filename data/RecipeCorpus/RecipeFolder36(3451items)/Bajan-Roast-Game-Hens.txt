Title: Bajan Roast Game Hens
Categories: Poultry, Caribbean
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Seasonin'
2 tb Butter or olive oil
4    Cornish game hens
(1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lb ea)
Salt and pepper
Preheat the oven to 400 F.

Remove any lumps of fat from inside the birds. Season the cavities
with salt and pepper and place 1 tbs Seasonin' in each.

Starting at the neck of each bird, worm your finger under the skin to
create a pocket between the skin and the breast meat. Try to loosen
the skin over the breast, thighs, and drumsticks. Work carefully so
as not to tear the skin.

With a small spoon spread 2 tbs Seasonin' under the skin of each bird.
Tightly truss each bird with string. Season the outside of the birds
with salt and pepper. Transfer the hens, breast side up, to a
roasting pan with a rack. Spoon the remaining Seasonin' on top of the
birds and place  1/2 tbs butter on each.

Roast the birds for 30-40 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer the
birds to a platter and let stand for 3 min. Remove the trussing
string and serve at once.
