Title: Chick-Peas
Categories: Vegetables, Information
Yield: 2 cups
Peeled and minced
1 md Bay leaf
1 pn Salt
1 pn Pepper
1 c  Dried chick-peas
1/2 lg Yellow onion(s)
Peeled and chopped
1    Garlic clove(s)
Place beans in colander, rinse, and pick over them. Put beans in large
stockpot, cover with cold water, and soak for at least 3 hours, or
overnight.

Drain beans and cover with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then remove
from the heat, drain, and rinse under cold running water. Return the
beans to the pot and cover with fresh water again. Add the onion,
garlic, bay leaf, salt and pepper, and bring to a simmer over
medium-low heat. Simmer, covered, for 1 hour or until the beans are
tender, skimming the surface of the stock from time to time to remove
any scum that rises to the surface. Drain the beans, then return to
the pot. Keep warm until ready to serve or save for use in any recipe
that calls for cooked chick-peas.
