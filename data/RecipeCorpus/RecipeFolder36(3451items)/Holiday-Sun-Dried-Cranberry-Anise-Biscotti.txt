Title: Holiday Sun-Dried Cranberry Anise Biscotti
Categories: Desserts, Fruit, Italian
Yield: 1 batch
1 c  Sugar
3    Eggs
2 ts Finely grated lemon zest
1/4 ts Lemon extract
2/3 c  Whole sun-dried cranberries
3 c  Flour
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/8 ts Salt
2 ts Ground anise or
3/4 ts Anise extract
2/3 c  Unsalted butter; softened
Mix flour, baking powder, salt and ground anise; set aside.  Beat
butter and sugar until the mixture is well blended.  Add eggs, lemon
zest and lemon extract.  Beat in half the dry mixture and stir in the
remaining half by hand.  Add cranberries.  This dough should look
like classic cookie dough.

Divide the dough in half and spoon each half into a log-like shape
onto a 15" length of waxed paper.  Roll each into an 11" log so that
all the dough is enclosed in waxed paper.  Chill the logs in the
refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

Unroll the logs carefully onto greased cookie sheets.  Press down to
flatten into 11 x 3" rectangles that are about 1" thick.

Bake at 375 F. for 15 to 18 minutes.  Cool for 30 minutes, then slice
the logs crosswise.  There's no need to turn the slices on their
side, unless the bottom of the slices appears to be overbrowned.
Gently separate the slices and return the cookie sheets to a 300 F.
oven for 15 to 20 minutes. If they still appear very soft in the
middle, turn the cookies on their sides and return the biscotti to a
turned-off oven for 20 to 30 minutes. Cool completely.

Yield: 44 4" biscotti.
