Title: Green Tomato Chutney 2
Categories: Vegetables, Can/preserv, Dips/spread
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 lb Onions
8    To 10 Chillies -- (hot)
1/2 oz Dried ginger
1/2 oz Salt
1 pt Malt vinegar
4 lb Green Tomatos
1 lb Apples
1/2 lb Stoned (or stoneless) small
-raisins
1/2 lb Sultanas
1 lb Brown sugar
Peel and cut up the onions, put in a large pan with a little water
and boil until softish (the original used shallots and omitted this
step You need to do this first, as the vinegar has a hardening effect
on onions). Cut up the tomatoes, peel, core and cut up roughly the
apples Bruise the ginger (if whole) and chillies and tie in a muslin
bag (I like to add mustard seed, bay leaves, peppercorns and/or mixed
pickling spice as well) (the foot of an old pair of clean tights will
do, or a jelly bag)
Add everything except half the vinegar and the sugar and simmer until
everything is soft - maybe a couple of hours.

Add the rest of the vinegar and sugar, and simmer until thickish.
Bottle - don't use metal lids or the acid in the vinegar will corrode
them. Improves as it matures.

Yield: about 7.5 lbs.
