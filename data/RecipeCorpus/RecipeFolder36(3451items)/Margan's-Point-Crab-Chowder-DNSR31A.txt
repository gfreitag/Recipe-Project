Title: Margan's Point Crab Chowder DNSR31A
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Soup/stew, Cajun/creol
Yield: 4 servings
3 ea Bay leaves
4 ea Lemon slices
8 ea Dressed crabs and claws
1 qt Water
1 x  Salt, pepper, tabasco/ taste
3 ea Bacon slices, diced
1 ea Onion, large, chopped
2 ea Potatoes, large, diced
1 qt Water
16 oz Tomatoes
1 tb Pickling spices-tied in bag
Brown bacon in 4 qt stew pot or Dutch oven.  Add onion
and saute until yellow.  Add potatoes and 1 qt water,
cooking 10 minutes.  Add tomatoes, pickling spice, bay
leaves, lemon, cooking 5 more minutes.  Add crabs and
1 qt water or more if necessary, to cover crabs, and
cook about 20 minutes.  Add salt, pepper, and Tabasco
to taste.  Since picking out crab meat at the table is
a messy matter, it is neater for the cook to do this,
returning just the meat to the chowder.  This dish is
improved by allowing to stand and reheating at serving
time.  From "Pirate's Pantry" formatted by Mary
