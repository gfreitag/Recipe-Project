Title: Cranberry Sweet Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 8 servings
1 ts Vanilla
3/4 ts Salt
2 1/2    To 3 cups flour
1 c  Cranberries, coarse chopped
2 ts Melted butter
1/2 c  Nonfat milk
1/2 c  + 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar
1    Envelope yeast
1/4 c  Warm water, 105-115 degrees
1/4 c  Nonfat egg substitute
-equivalent to 1 egg
Heat milk and 1/2 cup sugar in saucepan to scalding,
then cool to lukewarm.  Combine yeast and warm water
in mixing bowl, stirring until yeast is dissolved.
Add cooled milk mixture to yeast mixture in mixing
bowl.  Stir in egg substitute, vanilla and salt.  Beat
in 1 cup flour. Beat in enough remaining flour to make
soft dough. 	Knead about 10 minutes, until smooth and
elastic.  Put dough into greased bowl. Let rise in
warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar over chopped
cranberries.  Let stand while bread rises. Drain
excess liquid off cranberries.  Knead cranberries into
dough. Shape into round. Spray baking sheet with
non-stick cooking spray, or grease lightly. Place
dough round on baking sheet. Cover and let rise until
doubled, about 45 minutes. Brush top of bread with
butter. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 tablespoon sugar.
Bake at 375 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden
brown. Let cool to warm. Makes 8 servings.

Notes:

1. It is important to let the milk and sugar mixture
cool completely before adding it to the yeast.  Or
else you will kill the yeast and end up with flat
bread.

2. If after draining the liquid from the cranberries
and kneading in the dough is moist and sticky, just
add a little more flour.
