Mango vinegar isn't a traditional West Indian ingredient, but it
certainly fits the Caribbean palate. use it to give a tropical accent
to vinaigrettes, chutneys, and pickles. Add a few drops to soups,
stews, and sauces.

Pour 1 cup vinegar into a measuring cup. Peel the mango and cut the
flesh off the seed in long, thin strips. Place the mango strips and
chili pepper in the vinegar bottle and refill the bottle with vinegar.

Let steep for at least 1 week before using. Will keep for several
months, provided the mango pieces remain submerged. Store in a cool,
dark place and it will keep almost indefinitely.
