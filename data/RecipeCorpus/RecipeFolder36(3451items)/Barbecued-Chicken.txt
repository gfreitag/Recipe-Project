Title: Barbecued Chicken
Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM---------------------STEPHEN CEIDEBURG--------------------------
1 tb Cider vinegar
1 tb Unsulfured molasses
1 ts Reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 ts Chinese chili paste with
-garlic
3 lb Chicken, cut into 8 pieces,
-skin and fat removed, or:
8    Skinless chicken breasts or
-thighs
1/3 c  Tomato ketchup
1/4 c  Hoisin sauce
Precooking the chicken in the microwave or gently poaching it on the
stovetop before finishing it on the grill ensures that the meat is
cooked through but the sauce is not charred If you like a hotter
sauce, increase the amount of chili paste.

Arrange chicken pieces in a micro-proof dish, with the thickest parts
toward the outside of the dish. Cover with vented plastic wrap and
microwave at HIGH (100%) 8 to 10 minutes, or until tender, turning
pieces twice.

Alternatively, in a wide sauce-pan, cover chicken with cold water and
bring to a simmer, skimming off any froth. Simmer gently until
chicken is tender, 10 to 12 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare the grill or preheat the broiler. In a small bowl,
whisk together remaining ingredients.

With tongs, remove the chicken from the dish or sauce pan and brush
both sides generously with barbecue sauce. Grill over medium-high
heat or broil, basting with the barbecue sauce often, until the
chicken is glazed on the outside and no longer pink inside, about 5
minutes on each side.
