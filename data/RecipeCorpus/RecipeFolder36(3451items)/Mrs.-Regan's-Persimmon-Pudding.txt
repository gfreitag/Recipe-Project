Title: Mrs. Regan's Persimmon Pudding
Categories: Fruit, Puddings, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM-----------------------SYLVIA STEIGER----------------------------
2 ts Baking soda
2 ts Water, warm
3 tb Brandy
1 ts Vanilla
2    Eggs
1 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Butter
1 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Cinnamon, ground
1/4 ts Nutmeg, ground
1 c  Persimmon pulp
Stir together sugar and melted butter.  Re-sift flour with salt,
cinnamon, and nutmeg and add to butter mixture.  Add persimmon pulp,
baking soda dissolved in warm water, brandy, and vanilla. Add eggs,
mixing lightly but thoroughly.  Add raisins and nuts, stirring just
until mixed.

Turn into buttered 6 cup heat-proof mold.  Cover and place on wire
rack in kettle.  Pour in enough boiling water to reach halfway up
side of mold. Cover kettle and simmer 2-1/2 to 3 hours.  Let stand a
few minutes.

Unmold onto serving dish. Pour 1/4 c warmed brandy over pudding and
flame. Serve with whipped cream.

Sylvia's notes: I used the rice bowl to my steamer, and the pudding
was overdone after 40 minutes!  A heavy, moist, not overly sweet
pudding. I couldn't really taste the persimmon.  If I make it again,
I'll definitely give it 5 minutes less in the steamer, although it
didn't taste burnt, it's a deep brown-black on the outside.
