Title: Garbanzo Parsnip Gnocchi
Categories: Pasta, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Gluten flour
2 ts Nut yeast
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts White pepper
Peanut oil; for frying
1 1/4 tb Olive oil
2 c  Coarsely chopped parsnips
3/4 c  Finely diced onions
1 tb Minced garlic
1/2 c  Garbanzo flour
Saute vegs in oil until onions are translucent and parsnips are soft.
Process until a smooth paste is formed.  Add all remaining ingredients
except peanut oil and blend until well mixed.  Heat oil in a 3" deep
skillet to 375.  Fill the bowl of a tablespoon w/batter and use a second
spoon to scoop it into the oil.  It may help to oil the spoon, but I
haven't had any problems.  Don't fry more than four at a time because they
get done in less than a minute and if you leave them longer they'll burn
and the fat content will skyrocket.  Drain and serve.

For the tomato sauce I recomend your basic homemade tomato sauce w/o any
bay leaf but some extra red wine.  Figger it out for yourself.  If you
can't make your own tomato sauce you've already read too far;-)
