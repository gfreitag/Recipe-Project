Title: Mushroom Croustades
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
3 oz Butter
1 sm Garlic clove
Fresh rosemary
4    Wholemeal cottage loaf rolls
1 lb Small cap mushrooms
1/4 pt Double cream
Cut the knobs off the rolls and reserve as lids.  Scoop out most of the
crumb from the rolls, taking care not to pierce the crusts.  Crush the
garlic with a pinch of salt, about 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped rosemary and
a good grinding of black pepper.  Mash these flavourings into 2 1/2 oz
butter and spread it thickly over the insides of the hollowed-out rolls.

Season the cream generously with salt and pepper, add 1/2 teaspoon fresh
chopped rosemary and leave in a cool place to infuse.  Slice the mushrooms
thickly, and heat the oven to 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6.

Sit the rolls on a baking tray and put the lids beside them.  Bake for 10
minutes until heated through and slightly crisp.  Meanwhile heat a large
frying pan.  Add 1/2 oz butter (don't be tempted to use more) and, when the
foam dies down, saute the mushrooms. Cook them, stirring frequently, for
4-5 minutes to reduce them and intensify their flavour.  Pour on the cream
and let it bubble up for a few seconds.  Turn and stir the mushrooms for a
minute or so until every slice is coated with the scant but richly
flavoured sauce.

Away from the heat, check and adjust seasoning.  Pile the creamy mixture
into the freshly baked croustades, top with the lids and serve straight
away with a large green (or tomato) salad on the side.
