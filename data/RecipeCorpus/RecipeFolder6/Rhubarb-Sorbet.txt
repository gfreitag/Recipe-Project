Title: Rhubarb Sorbet
Categories: Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 8 servings
1    Orange (zest only)
2    Egg whites
1 lb Rhubarb (trimmed weight)
4 tb Honey
Prepare and cook the rhubarb at least a day ahead of serving the sorbet.
Wipe and trim the fruit, then slice it quite thinly into a flameproof
casserole.  Sprinke the finely grated orange zest over it and drizzle on 2
tablespoons of the honey.  Cover and leave in a cool place for 2 hours or
more until the sweetener has drawn out some of the rhubarb juices; this
liquid will prevent sticking during cooking.

Cook the rhubarb in the covered dish until perfectly tender - I think
this is best done in a low oven but you can use a very gentle flame on top
of the stove if you prefer.  Let the cooked rhubarb cool slightly, then add
the remaining 2 tablespoons honey and whizz to a very smooth puree in a
food-processor.

When the puree is quite cold, freeze it in a chilled loaf tin, or other
suitable container, until firm round the edges.  Beat the half-frozen
sorbet until slushly.  Whisk the egg whites and fold them in so the mixture
looks like a pale pink snow.  Cover and freeze until solid. Beat to break
up ice crystals and to increase bulk, then freeze the sorbet again until
you are ready to serve it.  Shortbread fingers make a good crunchy
accompaniment.
