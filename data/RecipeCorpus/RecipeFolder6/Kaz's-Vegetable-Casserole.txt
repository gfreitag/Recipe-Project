Title: Kaz's Vegetable Casserole
Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables, Casseroles
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 tb Natural or hazelnut yoghurt
1 tb White wine vinegar
2 ts Brown mustard seeds
4    Mushrooms
2    Onions
5    Mange tout
220 g  Chick peas
400 g  Tomatoes with chili spices
White grape juice is just as good as white wine if you want to avoid the
alcohol. The recipe works well without either.

I made this one up when I couldn't be bothered to follow a recipe, so I'd
be interested to know what you think of it. It is also nice with a crumble
topping - I use an ordinary wholemeal crumble mix and add sunflower seeds
to it, or cashew nuts, to give it a slightly nutty taste.

Preparation: chop the onions into 2cm pieces and finely dice the
mushrooms.
:

Add all the vegetables to a casserole dish, then add the spices, chickpeas,
yoghurt and white wine. If possible leave to marinate for a couple of hours
to let the vegetables absorb the taste.

Microwave on high (650w oven) for 15 minutes, or longer if you want the
vegetables to be soft rather than crunchy - say 20 minutes.

Serve with Biryani rice - I use brown rice with lentils, almonds, sultanas
and a mixture of vegetables such as carrots and broccoli.
