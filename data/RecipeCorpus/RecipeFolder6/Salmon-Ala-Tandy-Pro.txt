Title: Salmon Ala Tandy Pro
Categories: Fish/sea
Yield: 2 servings
4 tb Butter or margarine, melted
2 tb Dill weed, ground
2    Salmon steaks, 1" - 1 1/2"
-thick
Juice of 1/2 lemon
This recipe is really simple. Rinse the salmon well, and place in a glass
bowl. Juice the lemon over the fish and refrigerate for one half hour or
so. Meanwhile, melt the butter or margarine and add the dill weed.

Prepare a hot BBQ fire (or preheat oven to 400F), and grease the rack with
non-stick spray (or prepare a baking dish in the same manner).

Rinse the salmon again, and cover liberally with dill-butter mix and bake
for 20 min. or grill. If you grill, usually grill 4 min. per side.

"I might be so presumptious as to suggest a nice portion of Fettucini
Alfredo, a few fresh green beans, cooked just until done a large bottle of
Chenin Blanc, two candles, and a smile!"
