Title: Salmon Steaks in Herb Blankets
Categories: Fish/sea
Yield: 4 servings
Fresh parsley, chives, mint,
Lemon thyme and tarragon
-- (or herbs of your choice)
4    Salmon steaks, 3/4" thick
4 oz Butter
1    Lemon
Choose a gratin or baking dish which will take the steaks side by side and
use some of the butter to grease it thickly.  Put the fish into it and
season with a squeeze of lemon, a generous grinding of black pepper and a
little salt.  Cover and set aside in a cool place until ready to cook.

To cook, simply dot the fish with the remaining butter, cover with foil
and bake at 375-400 F (190-200 C) gas mark 5-6 for 20 to 25 minutes until
the fish is hot and tender.  While it cooks, chop coarsely and mix together
heady handfuls of aromatic herbs.  I would probably use something like 8
tablespoons parsley, 6 of chives, 4 of mint and no more than 2 teaspoons
each of lemon thyme and tarragon.  You may prefer to use a little dill or
fennel in place of tarragon, or to concoct some quite different cocktail of
your own.

Scatter nearly half the herbs on a warm serving dish and lay the fish
steaks on a bed of herbs.  Scatter more herbs over the fish, spoon on the
buttery cooking juices then the remaining herbs.  Serve with wedges of
lemon and steamed new potatoes.  (Other vegetables are best served as a
separate course.)
