Ben's Chocolate Ice Cream is about as rich as they come. The pinch of salt
helps to bring out the chocolate flavor. Melt the unsweetened chocolate in
the top of a double boiler over hot, not boiling water. Gradually whisk in
the milk and heat, stirring constantly, until smooth. Remove from the heat
and let cool. Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until light anf fluffy, 1-2
minutes. Whisk in the sugar, a little at a time, then continue whisking
until completely blended, about 1 minute more. Add the cream, vanilla and
salt and whisk to blend. Pour the chocolate mixture into the cream mixture
and blend. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 1-3 hours, depending on
your refrigerator. Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and freeze
following the manufacturer's instructions. Makes 1 generous quart.
VARIATION: Chocolate Almond- Add 1 cup roasted whole almonds (salted or
unsalted) after the ice cream stiffens, about 2 minutes before it is done,
then continue to freeze until the ice cream is ready.
