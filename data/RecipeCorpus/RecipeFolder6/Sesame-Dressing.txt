Title: Sesame Dressing
Categories: Sauces, Salads, Pasta, Dressings
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
Tabasco; to taste
1/4 c  Salad oil
1/4 oz Toasted sesame seeds
Peanut butter; to taste
Roasted garlic; to taste
1/4 lb Sugar
1/2 c  Red vinegar
3/4 oz Onion; chopped
1/8 ts Salt
Paprika; to taste
1 tb Dry mustard
Prepare like a vinaigrette dressing. The dry mustard will be the emulsifier
for the oil and vinegar.

This won't have the peanutty taste that the other has, but you can
experiment with the addition of peanut butter and garlic in this recipe. My
suggestion is 2 tbsp of PB and 1 tbsp of roasted garlic.

Also, you may want to convert this recipe. It yields about 1 1/2 quarts.

Karen's note:  This recipe has been resized to make about six 2-tablespoon
servings, so it will now yield about 3/4 cup of dressing.  The notes from
John regarding peanut butter and roasted garlic were for the original
recipe, so you may decrease them as desired.
