Categories: Thai
Yield: 2 servings
1 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Chopped toasted peanuts
1/4 ts Ground dry shrimp
Freshly ground white pepper
1/4 ts Asian chili powder
- (to taste)
1 c  Bean sprouts
- washed & drained
1/4 c  Scallions, cut 3/4" long
Fresh coriander
Wedges of fresh lime
1/3 lb Flat rice stick noodles
- (banh pho), 1/4 " wide
1/4 c  Peanut oil
1/4 lb Pork
- cut into matchstick strips
6    Shrimps, peeled and deveined
1 ts Crushed garlic
1    Egg
2 tb Water
2 tb Rice vinegar
1 tb Fish sauce
Soak noodles in warm water for 60 minutes.  Drain and set aside.

Prepare all other ingredients and arrange near the wok.  You will need to
work fast.

In the wok, fry the pork in the peanut oil at medium heat.  When half
cooked, add the shrimps and garlic and stir.  Cook until shrimp and pork
are done.

Beat the egg and add it to the mixture.  Cook, stirring, for about half a
minute.

Turn the heat to high.  Add the drained noodles to shrimp mixture.  Add
water, vinegar, fish sauce, sugar, shrimp powder, and most of the peanuts.
Sprinkle in white pepper and chili powder.  Toss to combine. Let it cook on
one side (Don't stir; keep checking the underside as if it were a big
pancake).  Flip it over as best you can and repeat until nearly cooked,
about 5 to 10 minutes.

Add most of the sprouts and scallions.  Stir and cook for another minute.

Turn onto a plate.  Top with the rest of the sprouts, scallions, and
peanuts.  Garnish with coriander and serve with a wedge of fresh lemon.
