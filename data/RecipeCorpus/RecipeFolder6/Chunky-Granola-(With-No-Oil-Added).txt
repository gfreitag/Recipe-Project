Title: Chunky Granola (With No Oil Added)
Categories: Rice/grains, Ethnic, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
- rice flour,
- or other whole-grain flour
1 ts Salt (or more, as desired)
1/2 c  Honey (or more,
-- up to double this amount)
1 c  -Hot water, or up to:
2 c  -Hot water *
1 ts Vanilla
8 c  Rolled oats
1 c  Nuts (more if desired,
-- up to double this amount)
1/2 c  Sunflower seeds
1/2 c  Whole millet
-OR- whole buckwheat groats
3 c  Whole wheat flour (or more)
-OR- part cornmeal,
* Note: More water makes the granola chunkier, less makes it crumbly.

Preheat oven to 350 F.  In a large bowl or pot, combine oats, nuts, seeds,
millet, flour, and salt.  Mix together honey, water, and vanilla, and stir
into dry ingredients.  Spread on a lightly oiled baking sheet and squeeze
mixture together to form small chunks, but don't crowd; the chunks need to
bake clear through.  Roast until golden brown, about 10 to 20 minutes.
(With the larger amount of water, reduce heat and bake longer.)  As it
bakes the granola may need stirring to brown evenly.  Cool thoroughly
before storing.

Variations:  Replace part of the water with the freshly squeezed juice of 2
oranges (and add the grated rinds if the oranges were not sprayed with
pesticides), or use 2 teaspoons orange oil.

For "gingerbread" granola, use half molasses (for half honey) and add 2
teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ginger and 1/4 teaspoon cloves.

For a nice change, substitute maple syrup for honey.
