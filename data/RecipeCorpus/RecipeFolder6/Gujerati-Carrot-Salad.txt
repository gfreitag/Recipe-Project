This is a Madhur Jeffrey recipe, published in the Toronto Sun. "Jaffray was
in town last week teaching at the Bonnie Stern School of Cooking. Using
ingredients available locally, primarily in the shops along Gerrard just
west of Coxwell, she wowed the classes with her masterful teaching,
attention to detail and wonderful aromatic dishes. She also proved how good
and easy Indian cooking can be. ...
Jaffray taught us how roasting, crushing and grinding bring out different
qualities in a spice. Crushing mustard seeds, for example, brings out their
heat but tossing them 'til they pop in hot oil calms the heat and brings
out a sweet nuttiness. Black mustard seeds, the finest mustard seeds are
essential and inexpensive ingredient, found in Indian groceries."

Trim and peel and grate carrots. In a bowl, toss with salt and set aside.
In a small heavy pan over medium heat, heat oil. When very hot, add mustard
seeds. As soon as the seeds begin to pop, in a few seconds, pour oil and
seeds over carrots. Add lemon juice and toss. SERVES:4 Serve at room
temperature or cold.
