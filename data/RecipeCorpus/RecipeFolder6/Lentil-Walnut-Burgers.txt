Title: Lentil-Walnut Burgers
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Walnuts; finely minced
1 sm Celery stalk; finely minced
1 ts Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 ts Dry mustard
1 tb Dry sherry
1/2 c  Raw wheat germ
3/4 c  Dry lentils
1 1/2 c  Water
2 ts Cider vinegar
1 tb Margarine
1 c  Onion; finely minced
2    Garlic cloves; crushed
10 lg Mushrooms; minced
This takes about 40 minutes to prepare: you can do "part 1" while "part 2"
is cooking, plus about 1 hour to chill, then 15 minutes to cook.

Makes between 4 to 6 servings, depending on the size of patties you make
and the hunger of participants.

Note: uncooked burgers may be individually wrapped and frozen.

Part 1:  Bring lentils and water to a boil in saucepan. Lower the heat, and
simmer, partly-covered, 30 minutes, or until lentils are soft, and liquid
is gone.  Place in large-ish bowl.  Add vinegar, and mash.

Part 2:  Saute remaining ingredients, except for wheat germ, together over
medium-low heat 10 to 15 minutes, or until all is tender. Add to the mashed
lentils, and mix well.  Add wheat germ and mix again. Chill for about 1
hour.

The Burgers:

1. Make 4-inch patties from chilled burger-mixture.  For freezing, make
patties, place wax paper between each patty and stack; wrap well and freeze
(or wrap individually).

2. Fry burgers in butter until brown, *or* broil about 8 minutes on each
side.  Try putting sesame seeds in pan to keep burgers from sticking to
pan, if it is a problem.

3. Serve either as patties, or as burgers in a whole-wheat bun. Good with
cheese melted on top, basil sprinkled on each burger is tasty also.
