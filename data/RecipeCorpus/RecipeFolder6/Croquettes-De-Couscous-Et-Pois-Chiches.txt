(Couscous-Chickpea Croquettes) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ If using
sunflower seeds, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread seeds on a baking
tray. Remove any shells or discolored seeds. Bake to 5-7 min., until seeds
smell nutty and darken slightly. Grind seeds in a food processor for 30
seconds until coarsely chopped. Add chickpeas and process until well mixed.
Keep mixture in the food processor. In a heavy, 1 qt. pot, combine
couscous, tomato juice and red wine. Stir and bring to a boil. Lower heat,
cover and simmer for 2-3 min., until couscous has absorbed all the liquid.
Let sit 5 more minutes. Add cooked couscous to chickpea mixture along with
remaining ingr. except oil. Mix well, stopping the processor and scraping
down the sides once or twice, until smooth. Lightly oil your hands. Shape 2
to 3 . Tbl. of chickpea mixture between your hands to form a ball. Repeat
with remaining mixture until you have 24 balls. Flatten balls to form
patties about 2" wide and 1/2" thick. Brush croquettes with olive oil and
place on a lightly oiled baking tray. Bake for 15 min, turn the croquettes
over, bruth with oil and bake another 10-12 min. Makes 24 2" croquettes.
These may be served in a sandwich, as an appetizer or as a main dish with
pasta and tomato sauce.
