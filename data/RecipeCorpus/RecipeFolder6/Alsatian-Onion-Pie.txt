Title: Alsatian Onion Pie
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
1/8 ts Nutmeg
2 tb Unbleached flour
1 tb Couscous
1    Wholewheat pie shell
-in a 10-inch tart shell
2 tb Oil (he recommends corn)
3 lg Onions; finely diced
1 c  Soy milk
1/3 c  Firm tofu; crushed by hand
1 1/2 ts Sea salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
Saute onions in oil (I added 1/2 cup water to prevent burning, or you could
substitute water for the oil to reduce fat), until translucent and mostly
soft.  Blend the soy milk, tofu, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and flour until
smooth.  Then combine the onions, the soy milk mixture and the couscous.
Pour into the prepared pie shell.  Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees
F for about 30 minutes.
