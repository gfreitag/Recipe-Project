Title: Stuffed Grape Leaves - Yalanchi Sarma
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
2    Tomatoes; finely chopped
1 ts Dried mint
1/2 ts Allspice
1    Garlic clove; minced
1    Lemon, juiced
-water (as needed)
1 qt Water
8 oz Preserved grape leaves
- stems removed
1 c  Cooked rice
1 md Onion; grated
2 tb Fresh parsley, minced
In a medium saucepan place the water and bring it to a boil.  Remove the
pan from the heat and add the grape leaves.  Let the grape leaves sit in
the hot water for 10 minutes.  Remove them from the water and set them
aside.

In a medium bowl, place the cooked rice, onions, parsley, tomatoes, dried
mint, allspice, and garlic.  Mix the ingredients together well.  Let the
mixture sit for 2 hours.

In the center of each grape leaf place a small amount of the rice mixture.
Fold the bottom of the grape leaf up and the sides over.  Roll the grape
leaf up.

Line the bottom of a large saucepan with some of the grape leaves.  Place
the rolled grape leaves on top, seam side down, so that they are tightly
packed.

Sprinkle on the lemon juice.  Add enough water to cover the rolled grape
leaves.  Place an oven-proof plate on top of the rolled grape leaves to
press them down.  Cover the pot and bring the liquid to a boil over high
heat.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer the rolled grape leaves for 45 to
60 minutes, or until most of the water is absorbed.  Let them sit for 1
hour before serving.
