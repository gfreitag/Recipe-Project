few large pieces, cover with 1 cup water in small saucepan and bring to
boil. Simmer 20 minutes, then puree in blender. Heat oil in pan and add
onions, bay leaves, cloves, coriander, parsley and garlic. Cook over medium
heat several minutes until onions have begun to soften, then add salt,
peppers and cabbage. Stir to combine and coat vegetables with oil. Add 1/2
cup water or stock, cover pan and cook over low heat 10 minutes. When
vegetables have wilted, stir in 1/4 cup pureed chiles or 1 to 2 teaspoons
chile powder. Add tomatoes, their juice and remaining water or stock. Bring
to boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer very slowly 30 minutes. When
finished cooking, remove bay leaves and puree soup until completely
blended. Return it to pan and season with salt, if needed. Add more chile
if desired. Serve soup with swirl of creme fraiche and sprinkling of
chopped cilantro.
