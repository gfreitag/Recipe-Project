Title: Pseftokeftedes Santorini
Categories: Ethnic, Appetizers, Vegetarian
Yield: 36 servings
1 ts Fresh mint (heaping measure)
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Double-acting baking powder
Olive oil; for frying
1 1/4 c  Peeled, chopped plum tomato
-(See Note)
1/2 c  Finely chopped scallions
1    Garlic clove; finely chopped
1 tb Freshly chopped parsley
1/2 ts Oregano
1/4 ts Cinnamon
In a large bowl, combine tomatoes, scallions, garlic, herbs, and spices.
Add flour and baking powder and mix together so that all ingredients are
well blended and have the consistency of a thick batter (about as thick as
pancake batter).

In a large heavy skillet, heat enough olive oil for frying.  Taking a
heaping tablespoon at a time, drop batter into hot oil and fry until golden
brown and crisp.

Remove at once with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Serve hot.

Yield: about 3 dozen

NOTE: In other islands, spinach or 'horta' (greens) are often used instead
of tomatoes.  Follow instructions above, using 1-1/2 cups boiled,
well-drained, chopped spinach, or any other greens.
