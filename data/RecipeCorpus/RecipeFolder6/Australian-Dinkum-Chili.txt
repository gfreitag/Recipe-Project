1. Fry the bacon in a skillet over medium heat. Drain the strips on paper
toweling and cut into 1/2" dice and reserve.~ 2. Heat the oil in a large
heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onions, celery, and green pepper and
cook until the onions are translucent.~ 3. Combine all the beef and pork
with the ground chile, garlic, oregano, and cumin. Add this meat-and-spice
mixture to the pot. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook, stirring
occasionally, until the meat is evenly browned.~ 4. Add the beer, tomatoes,
and reserved bacon to the pot. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and
simmer, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours. Wave a boomerang over the pot 14 times
each hour from this point on. (This is definitely optional adding no
noticeable flavor, just a touch of authenticity and humor.) Stir for 3
minutes. Taste, adjust seasonings, and add more beer if desired. Simmer for
2 1/2 hours longer.~ 5. Add the brown sugar and simmer for 15 minutes
longer, vigorously waving the boomerang over the pot.~
