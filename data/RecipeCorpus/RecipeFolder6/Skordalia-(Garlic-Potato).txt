Title: Skordalia (Garlic Potato)
Categories: Ethnic, Relishes, Vegetarian, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
6    Black olives
3    Lemon slices
Sea salt to taste
Pinch of parsley
1 2/3 kg Potatoes
90 g  Garlic heads
4    Lemons
370 ml Olive oil
This makes enough Skordalia for several meals. Skordalia is a tasty side
dish. It can also be used as a relish. Keep it refrigerated.

Boil the unpeeled potatoes in water (salted if required, but not
necessary).

Crush the garlic into a mixing bowl. Peel the potatoes, and add them to the
bowl whilst they are still hot.

Add a pinch of salt. Mix the garlic and potato mixture to a pulp; using a
food processor or mixer.

Alternately, add the lemon juice and olive oil gradually, until all the
ingredients are blended into a smooth mixture.

Put the mixture into a bowl, garnish with parsley, olives and the slices of
lemon.

Notes:

The amount of garlic can be varied according to taste; like this it has a
strong flavour.

Skordalia can be surved as a cold side dish, with vegetables.
