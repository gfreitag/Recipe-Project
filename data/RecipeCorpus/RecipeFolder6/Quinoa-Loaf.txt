Title: Quinoa Loaf
Categories: Vegetarian, Rice/grains, Ethnic
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Finely diced red bell pepper
1 ts Sea salt
2 tb Sesame seeds
1 1/2 c  Cooked pinto beans
4 tb Tahini
4 tb Whole wheat flour
-(stone-ground)
4 tb Gluten flour
1 1/2 c  Quinoa
3 c  -Water
1/2 ts Sea salt
2 tb Olive oil
2 c  Finely diced celery
1/2 c  Finely diced fennel
1 c  Finely diced onions
4 ts Minced garlic
Place the quinoa in a medium saucepan along with the water and 1/2 teaspoon
salt.  Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, until all the water has
evaporated (about 15 minutes).  Set aside.

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan.  Saute the celery, fennel, onions,
garlic, and bell pepper, along with the salt, marjoram, and cardamom, for
about 5 minutes.  Stir occasionally to prevent burning.  Add the cooked
quinoa and the sesame seeds, pinto beans, and tahini to the sauteed
vegetables.  Blend the ingredients.

Mix the two flours together and blend into the vegetable and quinoa
mixture. Line a large loaf pan with a baking sheet liner and lightly oil
the liner.  (In lieu of the baking sheet liner, you could just oil and
flour the pan.)  Press the mixture into the pan.  Bake at 400 degrees F for
about 45 minutes.  (The loaf should reach an internal temperature of
180-200 degrees F.)  Let the loaf cool, inverted, for 10 minutes before
removing it from the pan.  Serve the loaf in slices, with your favorite
tomato (or other) sauce if desired.
