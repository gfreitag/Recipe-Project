together well.  Add 5 tb of cold water slowly, beating it until the mixture
is smooth & free of lumps.  Slowly add another 3 tb water & continue to
beat until well mixed.  Check the conssitency, it should resemble the
consistency of heavy cream & easily coat a spoon.  If it does not, add more
water, till it does.

Cover the batter & set aside for 10 to 15 minutes to let it settle.

Beat again for a couple of minutes to lighten the batter. Stir in the
baking powder at this point if you want a cake like crust.

Cauliflower florets Eggplant cut into 1/4-inch rounds Potatoes or yams cut
into 1/8-inch rounds Bell peppers, sliced 1/4-inch thick Zucchini, cut on
the diagonal, 1/4-inch thick Asparagus tips, blanched & dried

Heat 3 inches of ghee in a wok or deep skillet till hot.  Dip your
vegetables in the batter & one by one sloip them into the hot oil.  Fry
until the pakoras are golden brown on all sides.  Remove & drain on paper
towels.  Serve immediately.
