Title: Nutritional Yeast "Cheese" Sauce
Categories: Vegetarian, Sauces
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Water
1/4 c  Margarine
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/2 c  Nutritional yeast flakes
1/2 c  Flour
2 ts Salt
Mix dry ingredients in a saucepan; add water nd cook over medium heat,
whisking, until it thickens and bubles. Cook 1 minute. Remove from heat and
add margarine. A dash of red food coloring or a dash of saffron will give
it a more traditional color.

This is a great replacement for Cheez Whiz and other stretchy, melty
cheese sauces.
