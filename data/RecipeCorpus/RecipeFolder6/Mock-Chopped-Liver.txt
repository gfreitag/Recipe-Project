Title: Mock Chopped Liver
Categories: Spreads, Vegetarian
Yield: 12 servings
- and turning brown
2    Garlic cloves (or more)
- (saute with the onions)
1/4 c  Unsweetened peanut butter
- (like Laura Scudders)
- optional
Salt & pepper to taste
Spike seasoning
- (if you have it)
1 c  Dried Lentils;
- cooked until soft, drain.
1 lb Green beans
- boiled or steamed until
- cooked, but not mushy
1/4 c  Peanuts (or more)
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
2 c  Diced onions; sauteed in oil
- until very soft
Blend it all in the food processor until smooth.  I do everything
separately, then mix it all together because my food processor is not big
enough to do it all at once.

Serve as a sandwich spread, or on crackers.

This recipe makes *a lot*.  I think it freezes well, just stir well after
it thaws, and make sure the lentils and green beans are well drained. Serve
with crackers or make sandwiches with it.  This recipe makes quite a lot of
spread.
