Title: Zesty Green Split Peas
Categories: Vegetarian, Low-cal, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
2 ts Ginger; peeled & minced
2 ts Jalapenos; seeded & chopped
4 tb Black mustard seeds; ground*
3 tb -Water
3 oz Coconut, shredded sweetened
1 pn Soy margarine (optional)
2 c  Green split peas;uncooked
8 c  -Water
2    Bay leaves
1/2 ts Ground tumeric
1 ts Salt
2 tb Canola oil;(I used 2 Tsp)
--------------------------------FOR GARNISH--------------------------------
Cilantro, chopped (optional)
*If black mustard seeds are not available, use 1 Tbs dry mustard.

Mix ground mustard powder in with water and allow to sit for 30 minutes.

Bring split peas and water to a boil.  Lower heat to medium. Add bay leaves
and tumeric (I forgot the tumeric--was good anyway). Simmer, covered, until
peas are done, 40 to 45 minutes.  (When pressed between the thumb and the
index finger, they break easily.) While simmering, uncover occasionally and
stir, adding a Tbs or so of hot water if the mixture sticks to the bottom
of the pan.  When cooked, remove and discard bay leaves. Add salt and keep
warm.  Heat oil in a small, 6-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Saute
ginger root and jalape o until ginger is lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes.
Add mustard paste and cook for another minute, stirring constantly. Add
coconut and stir several times. Remove from heat. Pour over the pea mixture
and stir. (I had to drain my peas, because I still had lots of water in
mine.)  Let stand covered for 15 minutes. Add a dab of soy margarine if
desired and garnish with cilantro. (I didn't use the cilantro)

I think this would make a good filling for pita pockets. I didn't think the
peas were "zesty" enough, so I sprinkled hot pepper vinegar on mine.
