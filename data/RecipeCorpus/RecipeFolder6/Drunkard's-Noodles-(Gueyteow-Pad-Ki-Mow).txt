Title: Drunkard's Noodles (Gueyteow Pad Ki Mow)
Categories: Thai, Vegetarian, Pasta
Yield: 2 servings
-- roughly chopped
6    Sweet basil leaves
1 ts Dark soy sauce
2 tb Light soy sauce
1/2 ts Sugar
1 sm Sweet red or green pepper
-- finely chopped
2 tb Oil
1    Garlic clove; finely chopped
2 sm Fresh red or green chilis
-- finely chopped
4 oz Sen yai noodles
1 sm Onion; cut into segments
1 md Tomato; cut into segments
4    Kaffir lime leaves
This is a favourite hangover dish - the chilis kick-start the benumbed body
while the lime leaf refreshes and clears the jaded palate.

In a wok or frying pan/skillet, heat the oil until a light haze appears.
Add the garlic and chilis and fry until the garlic is golden brown.  Add
the noodles, stir, add the remaining ingredients and stir well until the
peppers begin to cook but are still al dente.  Turn on to a dish.
