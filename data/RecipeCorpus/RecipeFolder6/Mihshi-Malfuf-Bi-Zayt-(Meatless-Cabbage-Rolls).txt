Title: Mihshi Malfuf Bi Zayt (Meatless Cabbage Rolls)
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
------------------------RICE AND CHICK PEA STUFFING------------------------
1 c  Chopped, peeled tomatoes
1/2 ts Ground allspice
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 c  Chopped spring onions
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 c  Long grain rice
1 c  Canned chickpeas; drained
1/2 c  Finely chopped parsley
---------------------------------TO FINISH---------------------------------
1 ts Dried mint
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1/2 c  Olive oil
24    Cabbage leaves
3    Garlic cloves
1 ts Salt
Gently fry spring onion in 1/4 cup olive oil for 2-3 minutes.  Turn into a
bowl and add remaining stuffing ingredients, adding salt and pepper to
taste.

Remove leaves from cabbage carefully so as not to tear them, counting
larger leaves as 2.  Par-boil cabbage leaves in boiling water until limp
enough to handle, cooking leaves in 2 to 3 lots.  Drain in a colander.

Cut out larger part of centre rib in each leaf and cut larger leaves in
half down centre.  Line base of a deep pan with ribs and any torn leaves.

Place a generous tablespoon stuffing on base of each leaf, roll up once and
tuck in sides to contain filling.  Roll to end of leaf.  Repeat with
remaining ingredients.

Crush garlic with salt and blend in crumbled, crushed mint and lemon juice.

Pack rolls flap side down in lined pan, sprinkling some of the garlic-lemon
mixture and olive oil between layers of rolls.  Invert a plate on top of
the rolls to keep them intact during cooking.  Add enough cold water to
just cover rolls and put lid on firmly.

Bring to the boil on medium heat, reduce to low and simmer gently for 45
minutes.  Remove from heat and leave aside for 30 minutes.  Serve lukewarm
or cold.
