Melt the butter or vegan margarine in a large saucepan and saute the onion
and celery for 10 minutes.  Stir in the herbs and flour and cook for a
further 1-2 minutes.

Add the stock and stir until thickened, then add the soy sauce, yeast
extract, nuts, breadcrumbs and salt and pepper.

Leave the mixture to cool, then form into 6 flat burgers about 1/2" thick,
and coat with dried breadcrumbs.

Saute the burgers in a very little oil - the frying pan should be "greased"
rather than oily - for about 3 minutes on each side, until browned and
crisp.  Drain on paper towels.  Garnish and serve.

VARIATION: MACADAMIA NUT BURGERS Using macadamia nut of the peanuts makes
these burgers special.  Serve with Bernaise Sauce.
