4 oz Buckwheat
4 oz Onion, diced

Heat oil in a skillet & fry the buckwheat for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add onions &
mushrooms & cook for a few more minutes.  Pour in the wine & stock & bring
to a boil.  Reduce heat & simmer for 20 minutes.  Add more stock if

minutes, then turn out onto a plate.  Serve with roasted vegetables &
greens.
