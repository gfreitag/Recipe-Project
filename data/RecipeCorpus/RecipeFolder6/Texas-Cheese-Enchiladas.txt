Title: Texas Cheese Enchiladas
Categories: Chili, Beans, Mexican
Yield: 4 servings
2    Yellow onions, large, choppe
2 x  Hile powder or ground
4 c  Grated cheese---either Longh
12    Corn tortillas
2 x  Hortening (lard best)
4 tb Cooking oil
2 x  Lour
Allow 3 enchiladas per person. Use a Pyrex utility pan (13-1/2" x 8-3/4")
to cook them. Lightly grease the utility pan (for authenticity use lard).
Preheat the oven to 400. Chop onions and grate cheese. Saute the onions
lightly in 2 T. oil. Melt lard in a skillet; stir in the flour and make a
light roux. Add ground chiles or chile powder, water and salt, and cook
until thick. Of commercial chile powders, Gebhardt's from San Antonio is
best, but not as good as ground *chiles pasillas*. Heat the remaining oil
in a skillet. Using kitchen tongs, dip each tortilla in hot oil until well
softened (about 15 seconds). Hold tortilla up and allow oil to drip back
into the skillet. Using the tongs, dip tortillas in chili gravy. Place the
tortilla in the Pyrex pan, put a good-sized pinch of cheese and onions in
the middle, and roll the tortilla, placing the flap side down. Continue
filling and rolling tortillas until the pan is full. Pour more chili gravy
on top of the enchiladas, sprinkle the top generously with more grated
cheese, and pop into preheated oven. Cook only until the cheese begins to
bubble (about 10 minutes). Serve immediately.
