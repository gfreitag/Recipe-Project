Title: Creamy Green Garlic Dressing
Categories: Dressings, Sauces, Salads, Vegetarian, Garlic
Yield: 1 servings
2 oz Silken tofu; mashed
2    -to
3 tb White wine vinegar
1/2 ts Sea salt; or to taste
2 tb -Water, or more as needed
8 lg Roasted garlic cloves
- peeled
1/2 c  Minced parsley, packed tight
2 tb Finely chopped shallots
1/2 c  Olive oil
NOTE:  To roast garlic, peel off as much papery skin from each large head
of garlic as will come off easily while still keeping the head intact.
Brush each head liberally with 1 teaspoon olive oil.  Place in a small,
shallow baking dish in the toaster oven and roast at 375 F until the
outside is lightly browned and the innermost cloves are soft, about 20
minutes.  Refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 2 weeks.

DRESSING:  In a blender or food processor, combine all of the ingredients
and process until smooth, adding water as required to create a slightly
thick consistency.

Use immediately or refrigerate in a tightly sealed container for up to 1
week.  Bring to room temperature before using and reblend, if necessary.
