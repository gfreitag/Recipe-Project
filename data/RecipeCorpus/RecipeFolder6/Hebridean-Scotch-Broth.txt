Title: Hebridean Scotch Broth
Categories: Soups/stews
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Carrot
1 sl White cabbage (1/2")
1 lg Leek
Black pepper
Parsley; to finish
1 1/2 lb Neck of mutton *
3 pt Water
1 ts Salt
3 oz Barley
1 oz Onion
1    Piece Swedish turnip (5 oz)
*Note: Neck of mutton may be either whole or in chops (use lamb only if you
have to).

Start to cook this dish the day before serving.  Boil the neck of mutton in
a large covered pan in 2-1/2 pints lightly salted water for 2 hours (or
more if the meat needs it).  Skim off all the scum and the excess fat as it
rises to the surface of the water.

Take out the meet when it is tender.  Put in the barley and leave it
soaking in the stock overnight.  Next day, bring the stock and barley back
to the boil.  Prepare and dice all the vegetables except the leeks to the
stock and cook for another 60 minutes.  Add the leeks, cut into fine rings,
10 minutes before the end of cooking.

If you want to have the meat in the stew, strip it off the bones, cut into
small pieces and return it to the soup before reheating thoroughly.

Put a tablespoon of parsley in each plate, and pour in the soup.  If you
prefer a two-dish meal, serve the meat as a main course afterwards with
potatoes - Golden Wonder are Chrissie's preferred variety.  Bake the
potatoes if they are mature.  Or boil them in their jackets if they are
new.  For really fluffy, floury boiled potatoes, Chrissie cooks hers whole
and unpeeled (never cut a Golden Wonder) for 12-15 minutes, depending on
average size.  Then drain out all but a little of the water, lid the pan
tightly and steam the potatoes for another 10 or 15 minutes, shaking
regularly, until they are dry and floury in texture.
