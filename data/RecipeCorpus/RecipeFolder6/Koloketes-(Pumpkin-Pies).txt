Peel pumpkin, remove seeds and cut into 5 mm (1/4 inch) dice.  Measure and
place diced pumpkin into a bowl.  Add remaining filling ingredients, stir
to combine, cover and leave for 12 hours or overnight.

Sift flour and salt into a mixing bowl, add oil and rub in with fingertips
until distributed evenly.  Add water and lemon juice and mix to a firm
dough.  Knead lightly, cover and leave to rest for 30 minutes.

Roll out dough thinly (about the thickness of a normal pie crust) and cut
into 15 cm (6 inch) rounds.  Take a round of pastry and moisten edges with
a little water.  Place a good tablespoonful of filling in centre, fold over
and press edges to seal well.  Flute edge with fingers or press with tines
of fork.

Place finished pies on lightly greased baking trays and glaze tops with an
egg beaten with a little milk.  Bake in a hot oven for 10 minutes, reduce
to moderate and bake for further 20 minutes.  Serve hot or cold.
