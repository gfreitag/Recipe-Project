Title: Rhubarb Raisin Crumble
Categories: Vegetarian, Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 8 servings
1 tb Finely grated orange zest***
2 c  Granola, pref. maple walnut
Maple syrup to taste
3 lb Rhubarb; trimmed *
1/2 c  Strawberry preserves **
1/2 c  Raisins
*Note: Rhubarb should be in 1-inch slices. **Use fruit-sweetened preserves.
***Use organic if possible.

Combine ingredients in a heatproof pan 13x8x2 inches. The combined
ingredients will seem dry; don't be concerned; the rhubarb will give up
considerable liquid as it cooks. Place pan in a cold oven, set temperature
to 375 F, and bake uncovered for 15 minutes. Stir and continue baking until
rhubarb is tender but still firm, about 10 to 15 minutes more.

Add maple syrup to taste if more sweetness is desired.

Notes: This recipe makes a big batch; it can easily be cut in half. When
stored in the refrigerator overnight, this dish takes on a pudding-like
texture.
