Title: Smoked Mackerel with Nuts, Grapes & Brown Rice
Categories: Fish/sea, Rice/grains
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 lb Brown rice
Fresh mint or watercress
2    Lemons
A little sunflower oil
1/2 pt Creamy yoghurt (or more)
2 sm Smoked mackerel
-OR- smoked trout
2 1/2 oz Chopped, toasted hazelnuts
-OR- walnuts
1 lb Seedless grapes
Cook the rice in double its volume of fast boiling salted water.  Refresh
it and dress it with 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon oil and plenty
of salt and pepper.  Stir in the nuts and 5-6 tablespoons chopped mint or
watercress.  (Watercress is good but mint is even better for this dish.)
Press the mixture firmly into a lightly oiled ring mould, cover and chill
for a couple of hours or more.

Close to serving time, halve the grapes and toss them in the juice of half
a lemon plus scant 1 tablespoon oil.  Add some mint or watercress sprigs.
Skin, bone and flake the fish and mix it in gently.  Unmould the ring of
rice, put some of the fish and grape mixture into the centre and garnish
with sprigs of mint or watercress.  Serve the rest of the fish mixture in a
separate bowl, and hand round the well-chilled yoghurt in a second bowl.
