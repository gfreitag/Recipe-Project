Title: BAKED PARTY DIP
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 6 Servings
1 ea Round loaf dark bread
5 ea Green onions, chopped
6 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
2 tb Butter
8 oz Cheese, cream
2 c  Cream, sour
12 oz Cheese, cheddar, shredded
1 cn Artichoke hearts
Bread should be unsliced. Preheat oven to 350. Cut a hole about 5" in
diameter in the top of the bread. (If you wish, make a decorative
zigzag pattern.) Reserve crusty part to make top for loaf. Scoop out
most of soft inside portion and save for another purpose. In skillet,
saute green onions and garlic in butter until onions wilt. Do not
burn! Soften cream cheese and cut into small chunks, then place in
medium-sized bowl; add onions, garlic, sour cream, and Cheddar. Mix
well. Drain non-marinated artichoke hearts and cut into quarters.
Fold in artichoke hearts. Fill hollowed-out bread with this mixture.
Replace top of bread and wrap in a double thickness of heavy-duty
aluminum foil. Bake for about 1-1/2 hours. Remove foil and top of
bread and serve, using thin slices of warm garlic bread as dippers.
Note: The best part of this dish is when the dip is gone and all you
have left is the bread, which is soaked in all those delicious
ingredients. Just break the bread up and pass it around!
