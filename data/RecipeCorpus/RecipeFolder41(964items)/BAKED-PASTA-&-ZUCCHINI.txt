1/2 lb rotini -- colored
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 lb zucchini -- (3 medium)
Salt
:
1 lg onion -- sliced
1/2 lb potatoes -- peel thinly
slice
:
8 TB butter
4 oz Prosciutto -- or
smoked ham -- julienned
:
1 1/2 c  grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 c  fresh parsley -- minced
2 TB chopped fresh basil
1 ts salt
Freshly ground black pepper
:
1 lb tomatoes -- peeled and

TOMATOES:  3 medium, rip.  Or 2 cups drained canned plum tomatoes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cook the pasta according to package
directions. Drain the pasta and set aside.

While the pasta is cooking, trim the zucchini but do not peel. Slice
the zucchini thinly, place in a colander, and sprinkle with salt. Let
stand at room temperature for 30 minutesto drain off excess moisture.

Put the zucchini between 2 layers of paper towels and squeeze dry
with your hands. Place the zucchini in a well-greased 9 x 13-inch
clear baking dish. Top with the onion slices, then with the potatoes.
Dot with 2 tablespoons of the butter and sprinkle the prosciutto on
top. Dot with 2 more tablespoons of butter. Sprinkle 3/4 cup Parmesan
cheese on top.

In a separate bowl, mix the pasta, parsley, and basil with the salt
and pepper to taste. Distribute the pasta over the vegetables in the
baking dish. Dot with 2 more tablespoons of butter. Top the pasta
with the tomatoes, dot with the remaining butter, and sprinkle the
remaining Parmesan on top. The casserole can be refrigerated for 4
hours at this point. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and
bake 45 minutes to 1 hour. Turn off the oven, open the oven door, and
let the dish stand for about 10 minutes before serving. [patH
