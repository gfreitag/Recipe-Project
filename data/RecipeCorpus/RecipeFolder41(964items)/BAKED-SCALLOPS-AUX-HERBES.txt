Melt butter, mix with wine

Mince parsley and chives together.  Set aside 1 TBL, stir rest into
butter mixture.  Add seasonings, pour over scallops and cover with
foil. The scallops can be prepared up to 4 hours in advance,

Preheat oven to 425^.  Bake ramekins 10 minutes, gratin dish 20-25
minutes or until scallop liquid froths. Watch carefully--overcooked
scallops are tough.
