Title: BAKE-IT-ALL-MIX
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  Vegetable shortening
9 c  All-purpose flour -- sifted
1 tb Salt
1/4 c  Double acting baking
Powder*
This Mix collection is from a company called Jewel. I don't think that
their product is available any longer, so I have substituted just the
word shortening for the Jewel shortening. I have had excellant
results using either Crisco or (lately) Mazola shortening in these
recipes. Unfortunately, I think the Jewel shortening has gone to the
shortening heaven with Spry and several others whose name eludes me
now. Thank goodness the recipes have survived!  *4 Tablespoons
Combine sifted flour, salt and baking powder. Stir well. Sift
into a large bowl or pan. Add shortening. Use a pastry blender to
distribute shortening throughout dry ingredients until the mixture
resembles coarse cornmeal and small peas. The Bake-It-All Mix is now
ready to use or store in a canister on your cupboard shelf. A cool
area is desirable. Yield: About 12 cups
