Title: BAKED ACORN SQUASH RINGS
Categories: Digest
Yield: 2 Servings
1    Acorn squash (about 1/2
-pound)
1 ts Maple syrup
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Water
1    Apple, cored and sliced
-(optional)
Wash the squash, then slice it crosswise into 1/4-inch rings. Remove
the seeds and pulp.  Layer the rings in a casserole dish, top with
maple syrup, dust on cinnamon and sprinkle with water. (As an added
touch, slices of apple can be placed in layers alternating with the
squash rings.) Bake, covered, in a preheated oven at 275 degrees for
about 30 minutes. The timing and temperature are not critical, so
this can bake along with other dinner dishes.
