Recipe by: Ladies' Home Journal magazine -- April 1996 Heat oven to
375. Combine sugar, chili powder, paprika, cumin, cinnamon and cloves
in small bowl.  Score top and sides of ham with knife in a crisscross
pattern. Sprinkle with spice mixture.  Place ham in a 17x11-inch
roasting pan. Bake 1 1/2 to 2 hours until instant-read thermometer in
center registers 140. (After 1 hour, cover ham loosely with foil to
prevent over-browning). Combine preserves and orange juice in small
cup. Uncover ham; brush with preserves.  Bake 5 minutes more. Let
