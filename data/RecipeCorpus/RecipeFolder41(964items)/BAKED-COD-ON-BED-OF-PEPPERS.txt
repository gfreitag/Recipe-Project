vegetables.

1. Preheat oven to 350'F.

minutes. Add bell pepper, garlic, allspice, salt and pepper. Cook
another 5 minutes, stirring.

3. Add olives, 1 tablespoon parsley and 1 tablespoon lemon juice; toss
well.

4. Fold a piece of foil, 18" long, in half crosswise; reopen and place
vegetables at center of one side. Top with fish.

5. Drizzle fish with remaining lemon juice. Season with salt, pepper
and remaining parsley.

well to make a tightly sealed packet. Bake for 15 minutes on a baking
sheet. Remove from oven and let rest for 2 minutes.
