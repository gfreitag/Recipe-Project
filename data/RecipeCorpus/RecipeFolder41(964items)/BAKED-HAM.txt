Categories: Penndutch, Ham
Yield: 1 Servings
10 lb Ham
1 c  Brown sugar
1/4 c  Flour
1 ts Mustard, dry
1/4 c  Maple syrup
3 tb Water
1 ea Cloves, whole
Note: This recipe assumes using an uncooked ham. Omit boiling the ham
altogether if using a pre-cooked ham. Wash ham and cover with boiling
water and let cook on top of stove for 4 hours. Let ham stand in
liquid over night. Next day remove the fatty rind, make gashes across
the surface of ham and stick in whole cloves. Make a paste of the
sugar, flour and mustard by adding the syrup and water. Use water in
which ham was cooked if available. Spread over ham and place in
roasting pan. Bake uncovered at 400-F for 45 minutes. Source:
