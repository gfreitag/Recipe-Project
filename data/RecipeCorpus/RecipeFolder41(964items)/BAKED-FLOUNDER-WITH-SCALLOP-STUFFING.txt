Title: BAKED FLOUNDER WITH SCALLOP STUFFING
Categories: Fish, Main dishes, Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Butter
1    Clove garlic -- minced
1 sm Onion -- finely chopped
1/2 lb Scallops -- chopped
Salt
Fresh ground black pepper
Dry white wine
Dry bread crumbs -- fine
6    Flounder fillets -- 5-7 oz
1/4 c  Butter -- melted
1/2 c  Hot water
WHITE SAUCE:
2 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
1 c  Milk
Salt
Fresh ground black pepper
Dry white wine
In a 10 inch skillet, melt the 1/2 cup of butter.  Add garlic and
onion and saute until onions are translucent. Add scallops and cook 2
or 3 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and white wine to taste. Add
sufficient bread crumbs to prepare a moist stuffing. Place each
flounder fillet dark-side-up on a flat surface. Placing the scallop
stuffing in the center of each fillet, divide evenly among the
fillets. Fold both ends of each fillet over the stuffing, overlapping
the ends. Pour the melted butter and the hot water into a 9x12 inch
baking dish. Transfer the stuffed fillets to the baking dish and bake
20 minutes while you prepare a white sauce. WHITE SAUCE:  In a small
saucepan, melt butter, then whisk in flour. Cook over low heat 2-3
minutes, whisking constantly. Then add milk, and salt, pepper, and
white wine to taste.  Increase heat to medium, whisking constantly
until the sauce is thickened. Cook several minutes over low heat,
stirring. When the flounder has baked 20 minutes, pour the white
sauce over the stuffed fillets.  Return the baking dish to the oven
briefly and heat until the sauce begins to bubble. -From Diana Rattray
