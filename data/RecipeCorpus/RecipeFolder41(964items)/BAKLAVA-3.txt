Title: BAKLAVA 3
Categories: Greek
Yield: 1 Servings
-=======
Ingredients:

Syrup:

1.5 cups  sugar 0.5 cup water 1 tblsp mazaher (orange blossom water)
squeeze   of lemon

Baklava:

phillo dough 3 cups chopped walnuts 1 tblsp cinnamon 2 tblsp
1 box
mazaher 2 sticks melted unsalted butter honey 1. Cook syrup first so
that, if you mess up the syrup, you can make another batch.

Combine all syrup ingredients and cook over medium heat and after it
has come to a boil cook for 5 minutes and remove from the heat. Do
not let it get too thick when it's still cooking or it won't be
absorbed by the phillo dough.  Place syrup in the refridgerator.

2.  For the walnut mix - mix walnuts, mazaher and honey. Mix honey in
so that the walnuts stick together but are not dripping.

3.  Using a pastry brush, put a coat of butter on cookie sheet.
Carefully place 1 sheet of phillo on top of butter. Brush sheet with
butter then put another sheet on top of that one. Continue until
you've used 1/3 of the phillo.

4.  Spread the walnut mixture on the phillo, leaving a tiny bit of
space at the edges.  Cover with the rest of the phillo, spreading
butter between each sheet.

5.  Make sure the top of the baklava has butter spread all over it.
Then. cut the baklava in squares.

6.  Place in oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes ~ but watch it
closely.

7.  When the Baklava is done cooking pour the syrup on top - a little
at a time using a spoon or ladle.

The thing to remember about the syrup is hot baklava/cold syrup or
cold baklava/hot syrup.  You want the maximum amount of syrup to be
absorbed.
