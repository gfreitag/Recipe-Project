Title: BALSAMIC GLAZED SWEET & SOUR ONIONS
Categories: New, Text, Import
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Cipolline or small (1 1/2")
-onions
4 tb Virgin olive oil
3 tb Sweet butter
2 tb Sugar
1 c  Balsamic vinegar
1/2 c  Basic tomato sauce
1 c  Water
1 ts Chopped fresh rosemary
-leaves
Peel the onions, leaving and washing any root strand you may find.

In a 12 to 14-inch saute pan over a medium high flame, heat virgin
olive oil until just smoking. Add butter and cook until foam
subsides. Add onions and saute until light golden brown on all sides,
about 8 to 10 minutes. Add sugar, vinegar, tomato sauce and water and
bring to a boil.

Cook onions uncovered, until just al dente, about 10 minutes. If
liquid dissipates too quickly, add more water, a 1/4 cup at a time,
realizing that it is essential not to overcook the onions. The sauce
should just adhere to the onions. Remove from saute pan to an
earthenware dish and hold in a warm place, or allow to cool if you
are serving them later or as an antipasto.
