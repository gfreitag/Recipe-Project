MMMMM------------------PARSLEY-AND-CHIVE SAUCE-----------------------
1 oz Butter

2 tb (heaped) chopped parsley
1 tb (heaped) chopped chives
Salt and pepper
Wash the joint to remove surface blood.  Put the meat into a large
clean pan and cover well with water. Bring to the boil, then turn the
heat down, cover with lid and simmer for 2 hours. Top up if the water
sinks below the level of the meat - at the end of the cooking you
should have 2 pints of liquor.  Leave it to cool, meat and all, and
lift off the white hat of grease (it makes good dripping after
heating gently to drive off the water).  Some families like the fat
left in.

Prepare the vegetables - scrub, peel and cut them into bite-sized
chunks as appropriate.  Wash and slice the leeks into 1/2-inch rings.
Then make the sauces.

For the MUSTARD AND EGG SAUCE: Melt 1 oz butter in a small pan. When
it froths, sprinkle in the flour and fry for a moment until mixture
is sandy. Stir in the mustard powder and tumeric and immediately
whisk in the broth and milk.  Whisk till the mixture thickens. Chop
the egg and stir in. Finish with the vinegar and beat in the extra
ounce of butter. Taste and add salt and pepper.

For the SPICED TOMATO KETCHUP: Chop the tomatoes, skin and chop the
onion. Put all the ingredients except the optional chili into a
lidded saucepan. Bring to the boil, turn down the heat, leave to
simmer gently for 30 minutes.  Push the contents of the pan and boil
it fiercely for a few minutes.  Taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve
either hot or cold. Finish with a few slices of deseeded chili if you
like it hot.

For the PARSLEY-AND-CHIVE SAUCE: Melt the butter in a small pan, stir
in the flour and let it cool for a moment. Whisk in the liquid
gradually and stir over the heat until the mixture thickens. Mix in
the herbs, taste and add salt and pepper.  Reheat the meat in its
broth (the cawl). Remove the meat and keep it warm while you cook the
root vegetables in the broth. Five minutes before you are ready to
serve, add the leeks. While the vegetables simmer, plain-boil the
potatoes separately. Stir the chopped parsley into the soup just
before you bring it to table.

As a second course, serve the meat with the potatoes, and the three
sauces.
