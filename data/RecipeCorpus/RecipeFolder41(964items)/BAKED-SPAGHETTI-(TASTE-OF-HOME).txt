"Every time that I make this cheesy dish, I get requests for the
recipe. It puts a different spin on spaghetti and is great for any
meal. The leftovers, if there are any, also freeze well for a quick
meal later on in the week."  -- Ruth Koberma, Brecksville, Ohio

In a large skillet, saute onion and green pepper in butter until
tender. Add tomatoes, mushrooms, olives and oregano. Add ground beef
if desired. Simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Place half of the
spaghetti in a greased 13-inch x 9-inch x 2-inch baking dish. Top
with half of the vegetable mixture. Sprinkle with 1 cup of cheddar
cheese. Repeat layers.

Mix the soup and water until smooth; pour over casserole. Sprinkle
with Parmesan cheese.  Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 30-35
minutes, or until heated throughout.
