Knead to a smooth dough. Divide the dough into 10 parts and shape
them into round balls. Drop these balls in the boiling dal, reduce
heat. Cook for 25 minutes then remove the cooked flour balls one by
one from the dal. Place the cooked flour flour balls in a greased
baking dish. Bake in a preheat oven 375F (190 C/ gas mark 5) until
the skin of the balls begins to crack and the colour turns light
brown. Place them in a dish and press each of them in the centre with
your thumb. Break lightly and put 1 or 2 tsp ghee in each bafla. Can
be eaten without ghee too.

Heat 3 Tbsp oil in a pan. Fry remaining half of onions until lightly
broened. Pour cooked dal. Stir well. Let it boil 2-3 times. Remove
from heat and sprinkle with chopped coriander. Serve baflas with dal.

Note: Dal (beans) should be poured over the baflas, breaking them
completely. Other vegetable dishes or chutney can be served with it
also.
