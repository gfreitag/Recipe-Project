Title: BAKED SALMON IN FOIL
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
3 1/2 lb Salmon
1    Lemon
Salt and Pepper
1 tb Oil or Softened Butter
Lay a piece of silver foil, large enough to wrap the salmon in a very
loose parcel, on a baking tray. If the salmon is to be served hot,
grease the foil with the butter, or use the oil if serving the salmon
cold. Thinly slice the lemon and put about half on the foil. Put the
salmon on top, with a few slices of lemon inside and lay the rest of
the lemon along the top of the salmon. Season generously and wrap
loosely, making sure the edges are securely folded together so that
no steam can escape. Put into a medium oven, Gas Mk 4,350F,180C, for
10 minutes per pound. If serving hot, take it out of the oven and let
it stand for a further 10 minutes. If serving cold, leave the salmon
in the foil for two to three hours. To serve: Unwrap the fish and
gently pull off the skin.
