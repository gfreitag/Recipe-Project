Categories: Picnic, Dried beans, Vegetables
2 lb white beans -- navy pea
beans
Yield: 12 Servings
:
1    onion -- studded with
2    cloves
1    bay leaf
1 TB salt
1 lb salt pork -- lean
1 lb smoked ham
3    onions
3    garlic cloves
2 ts mustard powder
1/4 c  rum

^^ SOAK washed and sorted beans overnight. ^^ Drain and add fresh
water to come 3 inches above the beans. Add the onion stuck with
cloves, bay leaf, and salt, and bring to a boil. Boil rapidly for 5
minutes. Skim the top, reduce the heat and simmer until the beans are
tender but not mushy. ^^ Meanwhile, put the salt pork in water and
bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 25 minutes. Remove the
pork from the water and cut it first into slices, then into small
pieces. Cut the ham into strips. ^^ Peel and chop the onions and
garlic cloves. Blend the mustard with a little bean liquid. Taste the
beans for seasoning. Place a layer of the beans in the bottom of a
large baking dish. Add a layer of salt pork, ham, onion, and garlic.
Repeat the layers ending with beans on top. Pour the mustard water
over the mixture, and add enough bean liquid to come to the top of
the baking dish. Bake in preheated moderate oven (350F) for 90 mins.
!! Keep the beans moist while baking; add more bean liquid or water.
^^ After 90 mins. remove and pour the run over the beans. Return to
oven and bake another 45 minutes, or until nicely browned and bubbly.
Reheat at picnic on camp stove or serve cold. (c) 1966 by Woman's Day
