Title: BALSAMIC CHARD
Categories: Low, Fat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 bn (~1-1.5 lb?) of swiss chard
(or greens of choice)
1    2 tomatoes, chopped (or one
cn Chopped tomatoes)
1    2 T balsamic vinegar
Freshly cracked black pepper
To taste
Wash the chard and chop or tear into peices, discarding tough stems.
Saute tomatoes over medium heat in large skillet until cooked to
desired consistancy, 5-15 min. (I like mine on the soft side). Add
vinegar, chard and water if needed.  Cover and steam vegetables until
cooked to desired doneness, 5-15 min. Check occasionally to be sure
there is enough water in the pan.

Cooking time for tomatoes and greens depends on how tough the greens
are, smaller, younger leaves will be more tender; and how well cooked
you like the vegetables.
