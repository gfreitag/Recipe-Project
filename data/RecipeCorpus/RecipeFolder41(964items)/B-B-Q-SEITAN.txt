Title: B-B-Q SEITAN
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Portions
1 1/4 lb Raw Seitan
- (1 box Seitan Quick Mix)
1/4 c  Oil for frying
3    Strips kombu sea vegetable
-- (2 to 3 strips,
-- about 12 inches)
1 1/2 c  B-B-Q sauce of choice
Prep time: 1-1/2 to 2 hours (most of time is in cooking)

Heat oil in a pan over medium heat and fry Seitan pieces for a few
minutes on each side until lightly browned. Soak kombu until soft,
then cut into sixteen pieces. Line bottom of 9-inch baking dish with
half the kombu. Place a piece of fried Seitan on each piece of kombu,
overlapping if necessary, to make an even layer. Place remaining
pieces of kombu on top of each piece of Seitan. Pour B-B-Q sauce on
top, then spread with a spoon to cover surfaces.  Gently add enough
water so that the Seitan pieces are almost floating. Cover and bake
at 350 F. for one hour. Add more water if necessary to keep Seitan
very moist.

This recipe has been developed by Bro. Ron Pickarski as part of his
work toward being a participant and finalist in the Culinary Olympics
held in Frankfurt, Germany.
