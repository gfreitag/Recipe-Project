Title: BAKED POLENTA WITH BACON & ONIONS
Categories: Italian
Yield: 1 Servings
3    Slices lean bacon, chopped
2    Onions, sliced thin
1 c  Water
3/4 c  Chicken broth
1/4 ts Dried crumbled sage
1/2 c  Coarse ground cornmeal
1 tb Unsalted butter
1/4 c  Fresh grated Parmesan
In a large saucepan, cook bacon until almost crisp. Remove the bacon
and take out all but 1 tbsp of the fat. Add the onions and cook until
softened but not browned. Transfer the onion to a bowl. To the pan
add the water, broth and sage and bring to a boil. Stirring
constantly, add the cornmeal, a little at a time. Cook over low heat,
stirring almost constantly, until it is thick and pulls away from the
sides of the pan, 20-25 minutes. Stir in the butter, 2 tbsp of the
Parmesan and half the onions. Spread in a 3 cup gratin dish. Mix the
bacon into the remaining onion mixture and spread on top of the
polenta.  Sprinkle on the remaining Parmesan and bake in the middle
of a preheated 400 oven until the cheese is melted and just starting
to brown.  This serves 2 as a main dish, 4 as a side dish. Can be
doubled or tripled and can be made and assembled earlier in the day
and baked when ready to serve.
