2 tb Sugar
1 pk Active dry yeast
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Butter
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Nutmeg
3/4 c  Eggnog; at room temp.*
I adapted a recipe from my food processor bread book for my b/m for
the eggnog bread which you read about. Here is what I did; you may
need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with
it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too
dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!!
* Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in the
microwave) Place ingred. in the B/M according to your manufacturers'
directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as needed This made
a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of my breadmaker. I
used the SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness or darkness
button slightly lighter than the center mark (I have a Welbilt). Let
me know your results, we sure enjoyed it! FROM: LISA CRAWLEY (TSPN00B)
