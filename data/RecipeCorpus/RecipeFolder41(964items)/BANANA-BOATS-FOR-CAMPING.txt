* This recipe is for 1 serving; make as many as you wish.

Slit each banana lengthwise but not all the way through. Leave the
skin on (do not peel). Put 1-2 teaspoons each of the marshmallows and
chocolate chips in slit. Sprinkle lightly with brown sugar. Wrap
tightly in foil, being sure to seal ends. Place on grill over
campfire or coals, seam side up. Takes about 7 minutes to cook.
