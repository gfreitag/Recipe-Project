Title: BAKLAVA ROLLS
Categories: Greek, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 lb Walnuts, finely chopped
2 1/2 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/8 ts Ground Cloves
Syrup:
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Water
1    Cinnamon Stick
2 ts Lemon Juice
1/2 c  Honey
1 lb Phyllo Dough
3/4 lb Unsalted Butter, melted
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Mix first four ingredients together for
filling. Combine syrup ingredients and cook until sugar dissolves and
mixture turns syrupy. Set aside to cool. Remove cinnamon stick before
using.

To Assemble:

Unfold phyllo. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut phyllo sheets
crosswise, into thirds. Cover phyllo not being used with a barely
damp towel. Using two pieces of phyllo - phyllo sheets are so thin
they must be doubled - and keeping narrow ends towards you, brush
with butter. Place 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons filling 1/4 inch from end
nearest you, to within 1/4 inch of sides. Fold long sides in 1/4
inch. Fold over bottom to cover filling.

Place a clean pencil on top of fold and roll into a cigar-like
cylinder.

Push both ends toward center and remove pencil. Place roll on cookie
sheet and generously brush with butter. Repeat with remaining filling
and phyllo.

Bake 25 minutes or until golden brown. Dip hot rolls into cooled
syrup - kitchen tongs work well for this. Place onto a platter to
cool. Cover and refrigerate. Can be frozen.
