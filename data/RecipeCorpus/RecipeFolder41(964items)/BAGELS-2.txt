Title: BAGELS 2
Categories: Breads
Yield: 30 Servings
8 c  Flour
1 tb Salt
1 tb Sugar
2    Cakes fresh yeast
2 c  Lukewarm potato water *
1/4 c  Salad oil
4    Eggs; slightly beaten
2 tb Sugar
2 qt Boiling water
Poppy seed or sesame seed
-(optional)
* (Water which peeled potatos have cooked in. Plain water may be
used, but it's not as good.)
Sift together dry ingredients.  Soften yeast in 1/3 of potato
water. Add to flour.  Add oil to remaining potato water and stir into
the flour mixture.  Add eggs and stir briskly to form a ball of
dough. Knead on a lightly floured board for 10 minutes.  (This MUST
be a firm dough) Add more flour if necessary.  Return to the
bowl--smooth side up. Cover with a towel (tea etc) and let rise at
room temperature until the dough rises to the top of the bowl.  Knead
again on a lightly floured board until smooth and elastic (as for
rolls). Pinch off pieces of dough and roll between the palms of the
hands to form ropes about 6 inches long and 3/4 inches wide. Pinch
the ends together firmly to make a doughnut shape.
Add sugar to boiling water.  Drop bagels into water one at a time.
As they come to the surface, turn them over. Boil 1 minute longer on
the second side.  Place on a greased cookie sheet and bake at 450 F.
until the crust is golden brown and crisp--10 to 15 minutes. Bagels
may be sprinkled with poppy seed or sesame seed before baking if you
like.
