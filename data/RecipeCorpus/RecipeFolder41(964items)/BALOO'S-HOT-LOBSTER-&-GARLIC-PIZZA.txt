Use a pizza dough of your choice to form a crust 30 x 40 cm. Spread
on it 1 cup of tomato paste. Sprinkle the thyme over the tomato
paste. Add half of the grated sharp cheddar (it must be at least 20
months old, a good alternative is Swedish Vaesterbotten cheese). Take
the meat from a freshly boiled lobster of 1 kg (400 g meat) and
slice. Put the lobster slices on the pizza and sprinkle fresh savory
over. Add berbere (a hot Ethiopian spice mix) and press the garlic
over the lobster slices. Cover with the remaining Cheddar and freshly
grated Parmesan. Bake in
225 c  for 10 minutes.
