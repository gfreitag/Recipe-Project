Title: BAKED COUNTRY HAM
Categories: Meats, Pork, Holiday
Yield: 200 Servings
14 lb Uncooked smoked ham
1 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Dry sherry
1/4 c  Honey
1/4 c  Dijon mustard
Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Put ham, fatty-side up, in a foil-lined
metal baking pan. Cover with foil and bake for 3 hours. Combine
remaining ingredients. Remove ham from oven. Carefully trim away all
but 1/8-inch of fat. Score with a sharp knife in a diamond pattern,
making cuts 1/8-inch deep and one inch apart. Pour excess fat from
pan. Line pan with new foil, and put ham in pan. Spoon glaze over ham
and bake for 20 minutes. Raise oven temperature to 325 degrees, and
glaze again. Bake an additional 20 minutes. Glaze once more and bake
15 minutes. Cool before carving into thin slivers. Formatted by T.
