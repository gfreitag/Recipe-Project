Title: BAINBRIDGE BUTTERSCOTCH SHORTBREAD
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 36 Servings
1 c  Unsalted butter
1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Finely chopped walnuts or
Pecans
Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder together and set aside. Cream
the butter until soft and gradually add the sugar. Add the flour
mixture a little at a time and mix well. Refrigerate for one hour.
Divide the dough in half and keep one portion in the refrigerator
while rolling out the other to approximately 1/4" thickness. (The
dough gets soft quickly.) Sprinkle the dough with the nuts and gently
press them in with the rolling pin. Cut into 1-1/2" squares. Pix uses
a paper pattern as she is hopeless at estimating things like this,
unlike Faith. Prick with a fork and place the squares on an ungreased
cookie sheet. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Bake until golden
brown, approximately 15 minutes in a preheated 350F oven. Makes 6
dozen squares. This is a devostatingly rich, crumbly cookie.
