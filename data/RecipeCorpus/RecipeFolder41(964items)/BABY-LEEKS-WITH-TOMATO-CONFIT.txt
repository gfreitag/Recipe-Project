Leek Molds: Lightly oil 4 individual 1 cup souffle dishes, about 4" in
diameter and 2" deep. Linewith clear plastic wrap, smoothing out
wrinkles as much as possible and leaving ends extended over tops of
dishes.

Trim off leek tops so leeks are about 5" long. Blanch leeks in large
pot of boiling water 2 to 3 minutes until leeks are tender but still
retain their shape. Plunge into ice water.

Cut bottom portions of leeks in lengths the same height as the souffle
dishes, about 2". Stand leek pieces on end around inside edge of each
souffle forming a leek "shell," with white portions of leeks toward
bottom of dish. Set aside.

Tomato Gelatin: Sprinkle gelatin over cold water in small saucepan to
soften. Puree 16 cherry tomatoes in food processor. Sieve to remove
seeds and skins. Add tomato puree to gelatin mixture. Stir over
medium heat until gelatin dissolves and mixture almost boils.

Reserve half the gelatin mixture at room temperature. Divide remaining
gelatin mixture among the 4 souffle dishes. Cover and refrigerate
until set, about 1 hour.

Tomato Confit: While molds are setting, in large skillet, saute
chopped onion in hot olive oil over medium high heat until soft.

Add quartered cherry tomatoes. Cook, stirring constantly, until
tomatoes are very soft and form a saucelike consistency. Remove from
heat. Stir in basil, thyme, white vinegar, salt, and pepper to taste.

Pour into bowl, and refrigerate to cool.

Herbed Cream Filling: In small bowl, combine sour cream, chives, salt
and pepper to taste.

Assembly: Reserve half the tomato confit. Spoon remaining confit over
set gelatin in souffle dishes.

Top with a spoonful of cream filling in center, then cover with
remaining tomato confit.

Carefully spoon a layer of the remaining gelatin mixture atop each
souffle.

Cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours until set.

To Serve: Gently loosen plastic wrap from sides of souffle with a
knife. Lift gelatin molds out of souffles using extended ends of
plastic wrap as "handles." Peel plastic wrap from sides.

Lift molds off plastic wrap with a spatula and center each mold on a
serving plate.

Garnish each with 5 prawns and deep-fried vegetables, if desired.
