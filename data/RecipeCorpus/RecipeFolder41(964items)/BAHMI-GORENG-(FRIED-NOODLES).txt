Cook the noodles according to the directions on the pack. Cut the
onions and garlic into fine pieces. Make little balls of the minced
pork and fry this together with the sausages in a wok or wide frying
pan. Then add the cooked noodles and stir-fry. Now add all the
vegetables, soy sauce, shrimp, ham, and spices, add salt and pepper
to taste ans stir-fry till it is thoroughly hot. Serve on a plate.
Add soy sauce, Sambal Oelek, or Sambal Manis to taste.  Sambal Manis
(dark hot condiment) is used more with these two than the soy based
pork ones.
