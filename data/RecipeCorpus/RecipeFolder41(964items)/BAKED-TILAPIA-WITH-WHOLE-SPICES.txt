Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
2 ts Peanut or other vegetable
-oil
1 md Carrot, peeled and cut into
-4-inch sticks
4    Green onions, cut into
-3-inch sections
8    Quarter-size slices ginger
-(no need to peel)
1 ts Whole allspice
3    Star anise pods, broken up
1/2 ts Whole peppercorns
2 sm Dried chiles, any loose
-seeds removed
2    Tilapia, cleaned and scaled
-(2 1/2 to 3 pounds in all)
Salt
3 tb White wine
1/2 c  Fish or poultry stock
1 tb Butter (optional)
This will work with other whole lean fish, including small rockfish or
farmed striped bass, and cuts or 'roasts' of halibut or pink salmon.
Adjust the cooking time according to the thickness and density of the
fish.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Rub a baking dish well with the oil, add the vegetables and whole
spices, and toss to coat them lightly with oil.

Arrange in an even layer. Rinse the fish well inside and out, pat dry,
season lightly with salt, and place on top of the vegetables.

Add the wine and 3 tablespoons of the stock. Make a loose tent of
foil over the tail of the fish and place in the oven.

Bake, rotating the pan once halfway through the cooking time, until a
skewer easily enters the thickest part of the fish, 25 to 30 minutes.

If you have an instant-reading thermometer, it should read 145
degrees F.to 150 degrees F.in the center near the bone. Transfer the
fish to a warm serving platter.

Strain the contents of the baking dish into a small saucepan; discard
the spices and vegetables. Add the remaining stock, bring to a boil
and reduce by a third. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.
Swirl in the butter if desired and pour over and around the fish on
the platter.
