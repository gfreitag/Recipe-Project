Categories: Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 Servings
3 tb Butter
1 tb Oil
3 lb Onion; sliced very thinly
1 ts Salt
1 ts White sugar
3 tb Flour
4 cn Beef consomme
4 cn Water
2 c  Dry red wine
1    Bay leaf
1 ts Sage
1    Sliced french bread; toasted
1    Mozzarella cheese; shredded
1    Parmesan cheese; shredded
Melt butter with oil in large soup pot - add sliced onions and stir
to coat - cover pot and cook over moderately low heat for 15 - 20
minutes - stirring occasionally until onions are tender and
translucent.  Uncover pot and raise heat to moderately high - stir in
salt and sugar (sugar carmelizes and helps onions to brown) - cook
about 30 minutes - stirring frequently until onions have turned an
even deep golden brown. Lower heat to moderate - stir in flour and
add a bit more butter if flour does not absorb into a paste with the
onions. Cook slowly, stirring constantly for 12 minutes to brown
flour lightly.

Remove from heat - pour about 1 cup of warmed consomme into
onion/flour mixture to blend flour and consomme - add rest of
consomme, water, wine, bay leaf and sage - bring to a simmer. Simmer
slowly for 30 - 40 minutes.

If you are not serving right away, let cool, uncovered, then cover and
refrigerate.  Reheat when ready to serve - place in ovenproof soup
bowls - top with a slice of toasted french bread, shredded mozzarella
cheese and parmesan cheese. Place under broiler to melt cheeses until
bubbly.
