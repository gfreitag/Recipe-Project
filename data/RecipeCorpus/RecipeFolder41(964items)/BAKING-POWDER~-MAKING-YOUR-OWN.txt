Title: BAKING POWDER~ MAKING YOUR OWN
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 1 Servings
Cook's Illustrated 5/6/93
1 ts Baking soda -- (an
Alkaline)
2 ts Cream of tartar -- (an
Acid)
For each tablespoon of
Baking powder called for
Unlike baking soda, which keeps forever, baking powder begins to
react and lose its potency the instant you open the can and expose
the contents to humidity in the air. For maximum leavening power, I
recommend buying baking powder in the smallest can available, dating
the can when opened, and discarding the contents after three months.
The alternative, uncommon but hardly daunting, is to make your own
baking powder. Simply combine one teaspoon of baking soda (an
alkaline) and two teaspoons of cream of tartar (an acid) for each
tablespoon of baking powder called for. This substitution works very
well for biscuits.
