Title: BAN-BAN JI (BEATEN CHICKEN)
Categories: Chicken, Appetizers, Chinese
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Chicken breast; poached &
-shredded
5 tb Ginger, fresh; finely
-chopped
7    Garlic clove; finely chopped
12 tb Tahini
12 tb Red oil
4 ts Chinese vinegar
4 tb Soy sauce
3 tb Sugar
1 ts Szechuan "flower" pepper
-ground
5 tb Sesame oil
Poach the chicken breasts very gently, for about 20 minutes total.
Leave them in the water to cool down. Shred them into matchstick
sized pieces of chicken (you can decide whether it's big kitchen
matches or little, book matches).

Mix all the other ingredients in a kitchen blender or food processor
until well-blended.  (This recipe, very minimally adapted from the
book noted below, is a double recipe. My blender, all 650 watts of
brute horsepower, had trouble moving the entire quantity once the
lower part was well- blended -- it would have been better to have
made this in two regular- sized batches, rather than one double-sized
batch.)

Serve the room-temperature sauce over the room-temperature chicken.
(Obviously, can be prepared well ahead of time. Don't shred the
chicken until at most a few hours before the meal, however, because
it will dry out.)  Suggestion: spoon half the sauce over the chicken
just before it's served; reserve the other half for people who want
extra "zip" in their dish. Garnishes optional.

Caution: direct from the cookbook, this produces a fairly spicy sauce
to put on the chicken.  But for people who REALLY want a hot dish,
you can add an almost arbitrary amount of red oil (pepper oil) to the
dish, maybe just cutting back on the sesame oil or the soy sauce if
you do so. I've had this dish so hot that my lips went numb -- best
"bung-bung" (as it's usually spelled) chicken in the world!
