Title: BAKLAVA
Categories: Greek, Desserts
Yield: 24 Servings
4 1/2 c  Walnuts (16 oz), chop fine
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1 lb Phyllo sheets
1 c  Unsalted butter, melted
1 c  Honey
Grease 13" by 9" baking pan. In large bowl, mix walnuts, sugar and
cinnamon, set aside. In baking pan, place 1 sheet of phyllo, allowing
it to extend up sides of pan; brush with butter or margarine. Repeat
to make 5 more layers; sprinkle with 1 cup walnut mixture. Cut
remaining phyllos into approximately 13" by 9" rectangles if desired;
otherwise, just be sure to butter the edges so you can fold them over
after you add the filling. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place one
phyllo rectangle in pan; brush with butter or margarine. Repeat to
make at least 6 layers, overlapping small strips of phyllo to make
rectangels, if necessary. Sprinkle with 1 cup of the walnut mixture.
Repeat step 3 three more times. Place remaining phyllo on top of last
walnut layer. Trim any phyllo that extends over top of pan. With
sharp knife, cut just halfway through all layers in a diamond pattern
to make 24 servings. Bake 1 1/4 hours or until top is golden brown.
Meanwhile, in 1-quart saucepan over medium hear, heat honey until
hot, not boiling. Spoon hot honey evenly over baklava. Cool in pan on
wire rack at least 1 hour, then cover and leave at room temperature
until serving time. To serve: Finish cutting through layers.
