For Fish: (4 servings)

Pour 1/2 cup warm water over raisins and set aside to plump. Slice
onions. In a large frying pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions
and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain raisins, and add to
onions with vinegar and the grated zests. Cook 1 minute. Add 1
teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat oven to 375 degrees F.
Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper and spread onion mixture on top.
Bake until fish is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes.  Sprinkle with
pine nuts just before serving. Work Time: 30 minutes  Total Time:
40    minutes

For Couscous:*  (4 servings) Put the couscous in a 9" square baking
dish about 2" deep. In a saucepan, combine the butter, salt, cinnamon
and 1 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil over high heat. Pour over the
couscous and stir once to combine. Cover with foil and let stand 10
minutes. Uncover and fluff the couscous with a fork before serving.

*You won't get the best results from following the instructions on
the box. This is an even simpler method for making couscous with just
a touch of cinnamon.
