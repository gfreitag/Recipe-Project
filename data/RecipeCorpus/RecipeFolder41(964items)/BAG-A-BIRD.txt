Marinade:  Combine all ingredients in a large bowl.

Chicken:  Mix chicken and marinade together in a large bowl and
refrig- erate for 30 minutes. Remove chicken from marinade and
lightly coat chicken with flour. Heat oil in a large skillet over
medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned.  Remove from skillet
and keep warm. In the same skillet, add mushrooms, wine and 6
tablespoons of the ginger sauce. Simmer over medium low heat for 5
minutes. Do not over cook.

In a blender, blend the first 8 ingredients together until smooth,
then add the red pepper flakes and the sesame oil and blend well.
Refrigerate.

Crepes:  Beat the eggs well. Beat in the milk, salt, flour and the
melted butter until smooth, or in a blender all together. Let stand
30 minutes before cooking. Heat a 10-inch skillet until fairly hot,
but not smoking. Film with butter.  Use a small measuring cup or pour
several tablespoons of the batter into the pan. Quickly tilt the pan
to spread the batter evenly in the pan. Cook until lightly browned.
Turn with a spatula and cook other side for about 30 seconds. Stack
the crepes, using a sheet of waxed paper between each cooked crepe.

To assemble: Remove the chicken from the warming dish and cut into
bite-sized pieces.  In the center of a cooked crepe, using a slotted
spoon put one-sixth of the cooked mushrooms, one-sixth of the cooked
chicken, 1 tablespoon of the ginger sauce and a sprinkle of chopped
green onion. On a serving dish, spoon some of the juice from the
cooked mushrooms and 1 tablespoon of the ginger sauce. Pull up the
sides of the filled crepe to form a bag.  Then tie the top of the
crepe with a strand of the green onion, to hold the crepe upright.
Put the crepe on the juices in the serving dish. Garnish with 1
drained peach half, several sprigs of the watercress and some sliced
green onion.
