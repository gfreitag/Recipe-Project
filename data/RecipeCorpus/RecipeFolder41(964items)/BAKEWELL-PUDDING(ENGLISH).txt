Title: BAKEWELL PUDDING(ENGLISH)
Categories: English
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Puff pastry
FILLING
Strawberry jam
4 x  Egg yolks
2 x  Egg whites
4 oz Butter
4 oz Sugar
Almond essence
Set oven to 425/F or Mark 7. Roll out the pastry on a floured surface
and line a wide shallow dish or a pie plate. Spread the pastry with a
thick layer of strawberry jam. Cream the butter and sugar in a bowl,
mix in the egg yolks, the beaten egg whites and the almond essence.
Spread this egg mixture over thejam in the dish bake for 15 minutes
and then reduce heat to 350/F or Mark 4 for 20 minutes. The filling
is meant to remain soft and is not intended to set.

This recipe first happened by mistake, when the cook at the Rutland
Arms, Bakewell put the egg mixture on top of the jam instead of onto
the pastry for a special strawberry tart. The Bakewell Pudding Shop
claim to be the sole purveyors of the authentic pudding, with the
recipe handed down only to members of the family.
