Title: BAKED PRETZELS
Categories: Breads, Abm, Snacks, Fat-free
Yield: 8 Pretzels
1 1/2 ts Yeast
1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Bread flour
1/2 c  Egg substitute
1/4 c  Water
1    Egg white
1 tb Water
Add yeast, salt, bread flour, egg substitute, and 1/2 cup water in the
order suggested by the bread machine manufacturer and process on the
dough cycle. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray baking sheet
with nonfat cooking spray. When the dough cycle is complete, remove
dough and place on lightly-floured surface. Roll dough into 12x4-inch
rectangle and cut into 8 (12-inch) strips. Pull each strip to about
14 inches in length. Form dough into pretzel shape: Make a circle;
cross the ends at the top, twist the ends once and lay over the
bottom of the circle. Pretzel logs can also be shaped just by making
rolled dough into a 12- to 14-inch rope. Place pretzels on prepared
baking sheet. In a small bowl, combine egg white with 1 tablespoon
water and brush on pretzels. If desired, sprinkle pretzels with
coarse salt, sesame, or poppy seeds. Bake in preheated oven 15 to 20
seconds. Serve with mustard or cheese dip.
