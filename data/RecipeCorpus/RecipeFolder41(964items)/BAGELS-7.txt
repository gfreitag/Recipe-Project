From "The Best Bread Machine Cookbook Ever", by Madge Rosenberg 1.
Add all ingredients for the dough except the barley malt syrup in the
order suggested by your bread machine manual and process on the dough
cycle according to the manufacturer's directions.

2.  at the end of the dough cycle, remove the dough from the machine.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  In a large pot bring 2 quarts of
water to a boil.

3.  While the water comes to a boil, divide the dough into 8 pieces.
Roll each piece into a roll 12 inches long. Make a circle of each
piece, overlapping the ends by at least an inch and pressing or
rolling the overlap tightly to seal.  Let the bagels rise for only
5    minutes.

4.  Add the malt syrup to the boiling water. (The syrup gives the
bagels their golden color.)  Lower a few bagels at a time into the
boiling water. As soon as the bagels rise to the top, remove with a
skimmer or spatula to a lightly greased baking sheet. Sprinkle about
3/4 tsp. of any of the toppings over each bagel and bake 20 minutes,
or until golden.
