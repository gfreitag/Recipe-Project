minutes and season to taste using salt and pepper. Remove from heat
and set aside. FOR COOKING: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place

fillets. Spoon the Creole sauce generously until fish and shrimp are
well covered. Place covered baking dish in oven and cook
approximately thirty minutes or until fish is done. Heat rice under
hot tap water and place an equal amount in the center of each serving
plate. Serve catfish Creole on top of white rice and garnish with
chopped parsley. This dish may also be served over pasta.
