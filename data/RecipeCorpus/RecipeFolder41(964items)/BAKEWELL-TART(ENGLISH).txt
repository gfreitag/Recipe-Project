Title: BAKEWELL TART(ENGLISH)
Categories: English
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Shortcrust pastry
FILLING
Raspberry or
Strawberry jam
4 oz Margarine
4 oz Caster sugar
4 oz Ground almonds
2    Eggs, well beaten
Few drops almond essence
Set oven to 375/F or Mark 5. Line a shallow pie dish with pastry and
spread with a layer of jam. Mix all the other ingredients together
and spread over the jam. Bake for 20-30 minutes until the fllling is
set. This version of the Bakewell Pudding is often preferred both for
its flavour and texture. The use of ground almonds makes the filling
firmer. Another variation of this recipe uses 2 oz. self- raising
flour and 2 oz. ground rice instead of the ground almonds.
