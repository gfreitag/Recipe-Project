Title: BAKED ORANGE ROUGHY WITH CHEESE & MUSHROOMS
Categories: Seafood, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Margarine
4    Large scallions, sliced
1 lb Mushrooms, sliced
1 1/2 lb Orange roughy fillets
1/4 c  Dry white wine
2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Dried marjoram
Black pepper
4    Slices cheese, cut into
-1/2" strips
2 tb Unseasoned bread crumbs
Preheat oven to 400 deg F. Grease a shallow 2-quart baking dish with
margarine. Evenly scatter the scallions and mushrooms over the bottom
of the dish. Place fillets on top in a single layer. (Overlap or tuck
under, the thin ends of the fillets).
Mix wine and lemon juice together and pour over the fish. Sprinkle
with marjoram and black pepper.
Evenly distribute the cheese strips over the fillets. Crumple a
large piece of waxed paper and wet it. Shake off excess water and and
place the paper loosley over the fish. Bake for about 7 minutes.
Remove fish from the oven, take off the waxed paper. Sprinkle fish
with bread crumbs. Bake another 7-9 minutes or until fish is just
done. Remove the fish from the oven and heat the broiler and broil
just long enough to brown the top of the fillets, about 1 minute.

Substitiue: Cod, haddock, catfish, ocean perch or rockfish.
