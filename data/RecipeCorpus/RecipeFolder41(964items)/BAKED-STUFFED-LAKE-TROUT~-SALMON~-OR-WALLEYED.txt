Marjoram goes well with fish, and here's a recipe that uses it both
in and on the fish.  Neither lake trout nor salmon need be scaled,
but do scale the pike.  A whole baked fish on a garnished platter
always looks good to guests. Salt and pepper the fish inside and out,
then stuff it and sew up or skewer the opening.
Place in a buttered pan and lay lemon slices along its length.
Stick a toothpick in each slice.
Add the vegetables, marjoram, bay leaf, and white wine and bake,
uncovered, for about 35 minutes in a 400 degree oven, basting first
with the melted butter and then with the liquid in the pan. CELERY
STUFFING Saute the chopped celery and onions in butter in a small
skillet for 15 minutes, until tender but still with a little bite.
Add the chopped celery tops and the bread crumbs. Season to taste
with salt, pepper, and savory.  Makes 1 cup. FENNEL SEED AND TARRAGON
