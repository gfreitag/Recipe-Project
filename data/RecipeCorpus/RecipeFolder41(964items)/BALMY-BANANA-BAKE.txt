Title: BALMY BANANA BAKE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 2ervings
2 tb Unsalted butter
8    Slightly underripe bananas
3    Juice of limes
3 tb Light brown sugar
This recipe calls for slightly underripe bananas because, as they
cook, they'll soften up quite a bit. Lime juice keeps the bananas from
discoloring, so they are easily made ahead through step 3. The sweet
and tangy combination is just right served after your jazzy meal.

1. Preheat oven to 375'F.

2. Butter a shallow baking dish; reserve remaining butter.

3. Peel and layer bananas in the buttered dish and drizzle with lime
juice.

4. Sprinkle with sugar and dot bananas with remaining butter. Bake
for 30 minutes, basting once or twice with sauce. Remove bananas from
dish carefully with a long spatula. Serve hot, with sauce spooned on
top.
