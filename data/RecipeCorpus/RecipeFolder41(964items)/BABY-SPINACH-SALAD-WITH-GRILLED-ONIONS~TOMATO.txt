Recipe by: Ed Kasky, Executive Chef at Engine Co. No. 28, Los Angeles
Preparation Time: 0:30 FOR THE DRESSING: Place the tomato paste,
tamarind pulp, shallot, and vinegar in a blender an mix well. Slowly
add the oil a drop at a time at first and then in a slow b steady
stream until it is all incorporated. Add the salt. Can be kept in th
refrigerator for 1 week.

FOR THE ONIONS: Peel and slice one large red onion thick enough so
that you can handle the slices and they will not fall apart when you
cook them. Rub them with a little olive oil and cook the onions over
a charcoal fire or under a hot broiler until soft. (Approximately 5
to 6 minutes per side.) Toss in a bowl with 1-1/2 tablespoons
balsamic vinegar so that the slices become single rings. These will
keep refrigerated 2 to 3 days.

TO ASSEMBLE THE SALAD: Wash and dry one medium handful (about 1 cup)
spinach for each portion and toss with enough dressing to coat each
leaf, being careful not to over-dres the salad. Arrange the onions
over the salad and serve. Always serve salads on chilled plates.

CHEF'S NOTE: Tamarind pulp can be purchased at Latin specialty stores.
