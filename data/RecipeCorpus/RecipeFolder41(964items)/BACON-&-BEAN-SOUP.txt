Title: BACON & BEAN SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 8 Servings
3 sl Back bacon
3    Stalks celery, chopped
2 md Carrots, chopped
1 md Onion, chopped
1 c  Chopped turnip
3 c  Beef broth
1    Bay leaf
1/2 ts Thyme
1 cn (19oz) kidney OR pinto
-beans, drained and rinsed
Prep time: 25 minutes.

When the vegetables are finely chopped it takes only a short
simmering time to develop and blend the flavors of the bacon and
assorted winter vegetables. The beans add character and a heartiness
that is satisfying. And an added plus - the soup is better a day or
two after it is made. Store it in a covered container in the
refrigerator.

Cut bacon into thin slivers.  In a 12 cup saucepan, combine
bacon,celery, carrots, onion, turnip, beef broth, bay leaf and thyme.
Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes or
until vegetables are tender. Add beans and continue to simmer 5-10
minutes or until hot, and flavors are blended. Remove the bay leaf
and ladle into warm soup tureen or soup bowls. Makes 8 servings.
