Title: BAILEY'S CHOCOLATE MOUSSE PIE #2
Categories: Irish, Pies, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
6 oz Ready Crust (graham/choc)
1 pk Unflavored gelatine (env)
1 ts Vanilla
3/4 c  Milk
3/4 c  Bailey's Irish Cream
6 oz Semisweet choc chips
2 c  Frozen whipped topping
Choc-dipped strawberries*
*As garnish, if desired.  -- In saucepan, sprinkle unflavored
gelatine over milk.  Let stand about 1 minute. Stir over low heat
until gelatine is dissolved, about 5 minutes.  Add chocolate and
continue cooking, stirring constantly until chocolate is melted: stir
in vanilla. Remove from heat and stir occasionally, adding Bailey's
about five minutes after removal from heat.  When mixture forms
mounds when dropped from spoon, fold in whipped topping. Turn into
crust. Garnish with more whipped topping (or real whipped cream,
later, by preference) and strawberries (if desired). Chill at least 4
hours before serving.
