Title: BAGEL CHIPS
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 10 Servings
1    Bagel
1/8 ts Garlic powder
1/8 ts Onion powder
1/8 ts Cumin
1/8 ts Oregano
1/8 ts Fat-free parmesan cheese
1/8 ts Chili powder
Preheat oven to 400 or toaster oven works fine.  With a sharp knife,
slice bagel into very thin slices so that you can almost see through
them (you'll get about 10 slices). Place slices on a baking sheet.
Lightly spray with cooking spray.  Quickly sprinkle in a small amount
of seasoning (a little goes a long way) or leave plain. Bake for 3 to
4 minutes until lightly browned-be careful; they burn easily. Break
each slice into 4 chips.
