Title: BAILEYS ICE CREAM
Categories: Ice cream, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Double cream
1 c  Full fat milk
1 c  Castor sugar
1/2 c  Baileys
Pinch salt
Whisk all of this stuff together until all the sugar has been
dissolved.

Then freeze as you would normally freeze ice cream, either in an ice
cream maker or in a tub in the freezer whisking every half hour or so.

Because of the alcohol content of this ice cream it will usually take
around 12 hours to become hard.  It does freeze hard so taking it out
the freezer 10 minutes before serving is advised.  It does melt
quickly so you have to eat it fast.

Don't put any more Baileys into the mix.  1/2 a cup may not seem much
but the flavour comes through very strongly.

I prefer this with a little Baileys poured over it.

Make it and enjoy it.  That is an order!
