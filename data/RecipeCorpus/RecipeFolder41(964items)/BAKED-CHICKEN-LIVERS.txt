Title: BAKED CHICKEN LIVERS
Categories: Meats, Low-cal
Yield: 5 Servings
1 lb Chicken livers
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Sage
1/2 ts Dry mustard
NOTE:  Liver is high in cholesterol, about 300 mg per
3 oz serving

Rinse chicken livers, remove any dark spots and fat, and pat dry.
Pierce each liver several times with a fork. (Note: any liver could
be cut into pieces about one or two bite size.)

In a 1 quart casserole, combine livers with seasonings. Stir. Cover
tightly.  Microwave at High for 1 min, then at Medium 5-6 min or until
liver is pink. Allow 5 min after cooking time.

For two servings, start with a bit less than 1/2 lb liver and half the
spices (or sprinkle them from the spice container). Cook about 1/2 min
High, 2 min Medium and check.
