Title: BAKED SQUASH
Categories: Low, Fat
Yield: 1 Servings
4 pk Frozen squash, thrawed (6
Cups)
1/2 c  Toasted oat bran
1/2 c  Maple syrup
1 c  Nonfat dry buttermilk (or
Nonfat dry milk or the vegan
Equivalent)
1 tb Grated fresh orange peel
1 1/2 ts Pumpkin pie seasoning
Mix together oat bran, dry milk, orange peel, and seasoning. Wisk in
squash and syrup. Bake at 350 degrees in a large rectangular pan (I
use glass) for about an hour. Serve hot or cold.

Notes: 1. I buy oat bran in bulk. Toast it at 350 degrees on a cookie
sheet with edges. Stir every 10 minutes until light brown. I add the
orange peel at this point and store it in the refrigerator. Do not
add the orange peel before toasting, it burns. Already grated orange
peel is available but the fresh tastes better.

2. I have made this with many different kinds of squash and or sweet
potatoes.  They are all good.  The frozen squash is just the easiest.

3. Original recipe calls for cinnamon, I like the taste with the
pumpkin pie spice but I've used others. I did not like plain clove.
