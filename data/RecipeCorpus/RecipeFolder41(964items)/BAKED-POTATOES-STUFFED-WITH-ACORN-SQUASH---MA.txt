Categories: Vegetables, Sides, Soup/stews, Potatoes
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Acorn squash (about 1 lb
-each), halved lengthwise
-and seeded
3 c  Coarse sea salt
4    Idaho potatoes (about 2 lb),
-scrubbed and dried
2 tb Olive oil
3 tb Finely chopped fresh sage
3 tb Finely chopped shallots
1 tb Heavy cream
1 1/2 ts Salt
Pinch of freshly ground
-pepper
1/4 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
1. Heat oven to 425'. Place squash on a parchment-lined baking sheet,
cut side down, and bake until tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Set aside
until cool enough to handle. Scoop out flesh; discard the skin. Puree
in a food mill or food processor; drain in a sieve set over a bowl,
about 1 hour.

2. Pour the sea salt into a large roasting pan and place potatoes on
top. Bake for 1 hour. Set aside until potatoes are cool enough to
handle. Reserve salt in the roasting pan.

3. Cut a shallow slash along the top of the potatoes from end to end.
Carefully remove the flesh with a melon baller, leaving 1/4 inch
inside the skin, and put it through a food mill or potato nicer. Set
aside.

4. In a medium saute pan, heat the olive oil over low heat. Add sage
and shallots and saute until shallots are translucent, about 5
minutes. Add squash, potatoes, heavy cream, salt, and pepper. Raise
heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir
in Parmesan and remove from heat.

5. Heat oven to 350'. Spoon filling into a pastry bag fitted with a
large plain tip and fill each potato skin to 1/4 inch over the top.
Return stuffed potatoes to the reserved salt and bake for 30 minutes.
