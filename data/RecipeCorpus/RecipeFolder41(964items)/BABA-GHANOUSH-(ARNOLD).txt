Title: BABA GHANOUSH (ARNOLD)
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 6 Servings
2 md Aubergines
2    Garlic Cloves, peeled
2 tb Tahini
Juice of 1 lemon
1 tb Parsley, Finely Chopped
Olive Oil
Salt and Pepper
Preheat the oven to gas mark 5/375F/190C. Prick the skins of the
aubergines with a carving fork and bake in the oven for one hour, or
until flesh is soft. Remove and allow to cool so you can handle them
without burning your hands. Cut in half and scoop out the flesh into
a bowl. Mash with a fork. You may prefer to use a food processor, but
i like the rough finish achieved with a fork.

Crush the garlic cloves with a hard blow from your hand on the back
of a large sharp knife and then chop the pulp finely. Add this, along
with the tahini, lemon juice and parsley, to the aubergine. Stir
everything thoroughly, and add enough olive oil to give a rich thick
consistency. Season with salt and pepper and serve with warm slices
of pitta bread or hot toast.
