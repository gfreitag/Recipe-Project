Categories: Fruits, Harned 1994, Sephardic, Vegetables, Yemenite
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Guavas
1 tb Oil
1 c  Mushrooms; chopped
1 tb Onion; chopped
1/2 c  Green olives; chopped
2 tb Parsley; chopped
4 ts Chopped fresh dill weed or
1 ts Dried dill
1/2 ts Each salt and pepper
1 tb Sesame seeds
To prepare the guavas for stuffing, cut a thin slice from the top of
the guava.  With a melon ball scoop or small spoon, remove the seeds
and set the guavas aside.

Heat the oil in a skillet.  Add mushrooms, onion, green olives,
herbs, salt and pepper; saute until vegetables are soft. Remove the
mixture from the flame; cool.  Stuff the guavas, filling them to the
top.

Place stuffed guavas in a baking dish just large enough to hold them
and sprinkle sesame seeds over the guava tops. Bake at 325 F. for 1
hour, or until the fruit is tender. Serve hot.
