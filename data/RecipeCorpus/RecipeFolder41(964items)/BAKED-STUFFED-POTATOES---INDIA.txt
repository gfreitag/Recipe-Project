[seperate recipe]
Scrub the potatoes and bake them in a 400 F. oven for
1    hour or until done.

While the potatoes are baking, prepare the filling. Saute the onions
and carrots in the oil until they are tender, for about 10 minutes.
Add the bell pepper and spices and continue to saute for another
minute or two, stirring. Add a little water to the pan to prevent
sticking, cover it, and cook for another 5 minutes, or until the bell
pepper is just tender. Stir in the cream cheese and add salt and
pepper to taste. Set aside.

When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, make a lengthwise cut in
the top of each one and scoop out at least half of the contents. If
you are using large potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise and scoop
them out, leaving about 1/2 inch of potato clining to the skin. Mash
the scooped-out potato and then add it to the vegetable-cream cheese
mixture. Lower the oven heat to 350 F. Fill the potato shells with
this mixture and place them in an oiled baking dish. Cover with foil
and bake for 20 minutes.

Serve topped with Spicy Yogurt Sauce. Baked Stuffed Potatoes served
with Dal and your favorite chutney make a complete meal. Note: this
dish can be prepared ahead. After stuffing the potatoes, wrap them
well and refrigerate for up to two days. When ready to serve, bake
them in a 350 F. oven for about 45 minutes.
