This is another wonderful first food.  Remember: the riper the banana
the easier on baby's digestive tract.

A little mother's milk or formula

Mash thoroughly and slowly mix in the milk.

As baby gets older you might want to try: milk, oatmeal, wheat germ,
cooked egg yolk or yogurt mixed in with the banana.
