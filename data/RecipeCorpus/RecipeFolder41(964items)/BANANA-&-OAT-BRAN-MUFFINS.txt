Title: BANANA & OAT BRAN MUFFINS
Categories: Muffins, Low fat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  All-purpose or unbleached
White flour
1 c  Oat bran
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon (I used 1
ts -I plan to increase more)
1/4 ts Ground ginger (I used 1/2
ts )
1/8 ts Salt (I omitted-usual for
Me)
1 lg Egg white(I omitted-dumb
Question but what purpose
Does it serve?)
1 c  Buttermilk (I used 1%-is
There a real difference?)
1/4 c  Packed light brown sugar
1 lg Ripe banana, mashed (I used
2    Medium)
2 tb Canola or safflower oil (I
Used corn oil-Mazola)
1 tb Mild honey, such as clover
(I omitted)
1/2 ts Grated orange zest (I
Omitted-what is it?)
Preheat the oven to 400. Coat 12 standard muffin tin cups with
nonstick spray(I use large paper muffin cups). In a medium bowl,
combine the flour, oat bran, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon,
ginger and salt. Mix well. Add the egg white, buttermilk, sugar,
banana, oil, honey and orange zest. Stir just until the dry
ingredients are moistened; do not overmix. Didvide the batter evenly
among the muffin cups. Bake on the center oven rack for 14 to 17
minutes, or until the tops are light brown. Loosen the muffins by
rapping the pan sharply against the edge of the counter. Remove them
immediately to a wire rack. Cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
