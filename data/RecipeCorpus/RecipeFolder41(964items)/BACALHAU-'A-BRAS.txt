1 1/2 c  Olive oil
2    Garlic cloves, peeled
8    Eggs

Soak the cod fish at least overnight, longer if possible. Carefully
remove bones and pieces of skin. Peel and cut the potatoes in long,
thick match sticks. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet, add the
garlic cloves and fry till golden. Discard the garlic. Stir-fry the
flaked cod. Add the potato sticks, previously lightly fried in
another skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Let cook for a while
over a low fire and meanwhile beat the eggs in a bowl. Scramble over
the cod and potatoes and let cook till everything is set together,
Sprinkle with the chopped parsley, decorate with black olives, and
serve surrounded by lettuce leaves and tomato slices. Variation:
Bacalhau 'a Lisbonense': In the same skillet you first fried the
potato sticks lightly fry 2 medium onions finely sliced. Add to the
main skillet when you add the potatoes. ----
