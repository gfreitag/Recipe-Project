Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment
paper. With a mandoline or other manual slicer, cut potatoes into
1/8-inch slices. Arrange slices on parchment lined pan and brush with
oil. Sprinkle potatoes with salt and pepper. Bake potatoes in the

immediately transfer slices to a rack to cool completely. Trim salmon
