Title: BAKED PEANUT BUTTER PIE
Categories: Desserts, Pies
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Corn syrup, dark
1 c  Sugar, granulated
1/2 ts Vanilla
3    Egg; slightly beaten
1/2 c  Peanut butter, creamy
1    Pie shell, 9"; unbaked
Blend the corn syrup, sugar, vanilla, eggs, and peanut butter and
pour into the unbaked crust. Bake in a 400 degree oven 15 minutes,
then lower the temperature to 350 degrees and continue baking 30 to
35 minutes more. The center should look "wobbly"; it will set as the
pie cools.
