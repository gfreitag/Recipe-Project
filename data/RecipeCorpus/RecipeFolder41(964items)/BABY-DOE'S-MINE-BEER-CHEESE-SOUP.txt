Title: BABY DOE'S MINE BEER CHEESE SOUP
Categories: Soups/stews, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 Servings
8 c  Milk
2 ts Tabasco sauce
4 ts Worcestershire sauce
4 tb Chicken base *
16 oz Cheeze Whiz
6 tb Cornstarch
1/3 c  Water
1 c  Beer
1/8 ts MSG (I did not use)
Cayenne pepper
Combine milk, Tabasco, Worcestershire, chicken base, & MSG. Bring to a
boil, stirring regularly.

Add Cheeze Whiz, after warming in hot water or in microwave. Mix in
well.

Dissolve cornstarch completely in the water.  Add to soup, which
should thicken immediately.  Reduce heat a bit and stir in beer.

To serve, ladle into bowls and dust with cayenne pepper.

*Chicken base can be found in the spice section.  I used Schilling's
Chicken Flavor Base.  Spice Islands also has a product called Chicken
Flavor Stock Base that is probably the same thing.

I would like to give credit to Scott Hammon, whose extra efforts
succeeded in wrangling this recipe from Baby Doe's chef. Since it's
been many years since I sampled this soup at the restaurant in
Dallas, I can't judge how closely this approximates the original.
But at least the results are tasty! Hope all who try it will enjoy it.
