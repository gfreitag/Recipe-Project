Tomato sauce recipe
Mix all ingredients for meat balls together thoroughly, except the
last, olive oil.  Form into medium sized balls: brown in oil. Set
aside and cook in tomato sauce later.

To make tomato sauce: Heat the oil: add onion, green pepper, garlic,
mushrooms (drained and halved) and saut=82 until golden. Stir in
tomato paste; cook for 4 minutes. Press plum tomatoes through a
strainer; add an equal amount of water. Combine with tomato paste
mixture. Add sugar, salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil; add meatballs
and cook over low heat 1-1/2 hours or until sauce thickens slightly.
Remove meatballs and put aside.

Cook tufoli in 6 quarts boiling, salted water for 12 to 15 minutes or
until almost tender.  Mash meat balls in a bowl. Add spinach (drained
and finely chopped), salt, 2 tablespoons cheese and the egg, mixing
well. Stuff this mixture into cooked tufoli. Cover bottom of a large
casserole with half of sauce and arrange alternate layers of stufted
tufoli and sauce, sprinkling each layer with cheese; finish with
sauce. Cover dish and bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees) for 30
minutes. Serve with extra sauce and cheese. Serves 6 very generously.
