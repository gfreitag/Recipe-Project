2 c  Crabmeat
4 lg Baking potatoes
4 tb Butter
1/2 c  Onion; chopped
1/2 c  Mushrooms; sliced
Ground pepper to taste
1 c  Dry vermouth
2 tb Low-fat plain yogurt
2 tb Sour cream
1/4 c  Half and half
3/4 c  Gruyere cheese
Clean and bake potatoes.  Cool slightly and cut in half, lengthwise.
Place pulp into bowl, leaving about 1/4-inch shell. Reserve skins and
mash pulp. Melt butter in skillet and saute onion until it takes on a
light coloring (about 15-20 minutes).  Add mushrooms and saute
another 5 minutes. Add the crabmeat and pepper. Add vermouth and
bring to a boil. Make sure you stir frequently.  Cook mixture until
liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and add yogurt and sour cream,
then add half and half. Combine crabmeat, onion mixture, pulp from
potato, and about 1/2 of cheese. Add additional ground black pepper
and a bit more half and half if desired. Place the mixture into the
potato skins. Sprinkle with additional 1/4 cup cheese. Bake at 400
degrees F. until cheese bubbles.  This is yummy good!
