Title: BAGELS (KOSS)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
4 1/2 c  Flour
2 pk Active dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water -- 110-115 F
3 tb Sugar
1 tb Salt
1 tb Sugar
In mixer bowl combine 1 1/2 cups flour and the yeast. Combine warm
water, 3 Tbls. sugar and the salt. Pour over flour mixture. Beat at
low speed for 30 seconds, scraping sides of bowl constantly. Beat 3
minutes on high speed.

Stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can mix in with a
spoon. Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Knead in enough
remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough. Continue kneading
until smooth and elastic, 6 - 8 minutes. Cover; let dough rest 10-15
minutes.

Cut into 12 portions; shape into smooth balls. Punch a hole in the
center of each with a floured finger. Pull gently to enlarge hole to
1 1/2 to 2 inches. Place on a greased baking sheet. Cover; let rise
20 minutes. Broil 5 inches from heat for 1 1/2 - 2 minutes on each
side. Tops should not brown.

Heat 1 gallon water and 1 tablespoon sugar to boiling; reduce heat.
Cook bagels, 4 or 5 at a time, for 7 minutes, turning once. Drain.
Place on greased baking sheet. Bake in 375 degree oven 25 - 30
minutes.
