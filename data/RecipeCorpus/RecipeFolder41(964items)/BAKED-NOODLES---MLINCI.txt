DIRECTIONS Crumble yeast into lukewarm water and add beaten egg, salt,
salad oil and flour. Knead well to make a medium dough. Roll out into
rounds as for noodles, only not quite so thin. Pierce each round with
a fork and bake in oven at 325 F until a delicate brown on both sides.
"Mlinci" are baked on the lowest rack in the oven and must be turned.
When baked, cool and break the "mlinci" into a large bowl. Pour over
enough salted boiling water to cover and let stand for two minutes.
Pour off water into another bowl and drain "mlinci" dry. Once again
pour on same water and allow to absorb about one hour. Pour hot
melted butter over "mlinci" and serve. You may substitute poultry or
pork roast drippings for butter.
