Categories: Pasta, Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Medium or Small Shells
-- uncooked
1 tb Cornstarch
1 1/2 c  Milk; divided
1/2 c  Chicken broth
-- homemade or canned
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
1 c  Frozen peas; defrosted
4 oz Canned sliced mushrooms

Prepare pasta according to package directions; drain. Rinse the pasta
under cold running water until cool and drain thoroughly.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In small bowl, stir together the
cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of the milk until the cornstarch is
dissolved. Heat the remaining milk and the chicken broth in a small
saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the cornstarch mixture and heat,
stirring, until the sauce is simmering and thickened. Add the salt
and pepper and simmer 3 minutes. Pour the sauce into a bowl, add the
peas, mushrooms, pimentos, chicken (if using), 1/2 cup of the
Parmesan cheese and the cooked pasta. Stir the sauce in until it and
the vegetables are evenly distributed. Transfer to a baking dish.

Stir 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese and the bread crumbs together in a
small bowl and sprinkle the mixture over the pasta. Bake until the
sauce is bubbling and the topping is golden brown, about 15 minutes.
Serve hot, passing additional grated Parmesan cheese if desired.
