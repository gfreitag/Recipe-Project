CARAMEL FILLING:
Sprinkle 1/2 C sugar in a heavy saucepan; place over medium  heat.
Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar melts and syrup is light
golden brown.
Combine remaining 2 1/2 C sugar, milk, egg, and salt in a  bowl,
stirring well; stir in butter.  Stir butter mixture into hot caramelized
sugar. (The mixture will tend to lump, becoming  smooth with further
cooking.)
Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until a candy thermometer
registers 230 (15 to 20 minutes).  Cool 5 minutes.  Beat with a wooden
spoon to almost spreading consistency, and spread between layers and on

vanilla.  Yield: about 1 1/2 C.
