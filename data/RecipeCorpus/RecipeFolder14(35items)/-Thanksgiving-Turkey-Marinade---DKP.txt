Title:  Thanksgiving Turkey Marinade - DKP
Categories: marinades, poultry, di, holidays
Yield: 1 marinade
See recipe
Thaw turkey (if frozen) on Monday & Tuesday in refrigerator.
On Wednesday, put 3 onions (cut up), 4 garlic cloves (sliced) and 1
large bunch of parsley in cavity of bird.
Pour Vernors (ginger ale) and 8 oz orange juice concentrate in cavity.
Cover and rub bird with Catalina dressing. Sprinkle with seasoned
salt and pepper and paprika.  I put the whole mess in a garbage bag and
marinate it overnight.
Before baking, discard all marinade.
Di Note:  When I finally bought my house, I wanted to have Thanksgiving
here instead of at my mother's (which was traditional).  I had NEVER
done a turkey before.  I bought this HUGE creature and started to
do the marinade thing (my Mom's recipe).  Well, I don't have much
counter space and this bird was a slipping an' sliding all over the
place and I was laughing hysterically.  I was actually fighting this
monster!  My Mom called to see how everything was going and all she
could hear was me cackeling.  She jumped in her car and came over and
here I was, on the floor with this damn bird in my lap and marinade
all over me. It was one of those moments...great marinade tho!
