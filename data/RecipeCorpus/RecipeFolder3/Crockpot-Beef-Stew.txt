Title: Crockpot Beef Stew
Categories: Soups/stews, Beef
Yield: 4 servings
-canned,stewed tomatoes,
-undrained (or plain)
2 tb Flour (or 3)
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Thyme
1/4 ts Basil
2 tb Worcestershire sauce (or 3)
2 1/2 lb Beef, extra lean
7    Carrots, 2" chunks
2 1/2    Potatoes, cut in eighths
2 1/2    Onions, sweet, cut in
-1/4" slices, slices
-cut in half and separated
-into rings.
1    Tomatoes, Italian-style
Layer the veggies and meat (in that order), mix flour and seasonings and
sprinkle over each meat layer.  Sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce, pour
stewed tomatoes over all, cover and cook on Low 10-12 hours.

Variable amounts are for 3-1/2 or 5 quart pots.  I make mine up the night
before and refrigerate.  My hubby (an early riser) puts it on about 7 AM
and it cooks all day.  There is lots of gravy, which may be thickened with
cornstarch if de- sired. Sometimes instead of potatoes, I cook large elbow
macaroni separately (Muellers Ready-cut) and put the  >>>>>> leftover
macaroni in the bowl with leftover stew to soak up the good gravy. I also
add a drained can of cut green beans to the veggies (during the last 4
hours) in that case.
