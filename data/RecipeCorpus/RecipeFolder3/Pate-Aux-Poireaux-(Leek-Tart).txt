Pate aux Poireaux

This leek and cheese quiche from Ile d'Orleans is related to the Flamiche
aux poireuax, a savory leek tart made in northern Franch and Flanders. The
same recipe can also be used to make small tarts.

Heat 4 tablespoons of the butter in a heavy saucepan, add leeks and cook
over low heat for 10 minutes. Add water, cover and simmer gently for 20 to
25 minutes or until tender.
In another saucepan, melt the remaining two tablespoons butter, blend in
flour and cook over medium heat until bubbling. Blend in leek mixture,
bring to a boil and season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.
Beat egg and cream together, blend with leek mixture and pour into
unbaked tart shell. Sprinkle top evenly with cheese. Bake in preheated 400F
oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until cheese begins to brown. SERVES: 6
