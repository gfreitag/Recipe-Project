Categories: Breads, Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Maple syrup
1 tb Vanilla
2    Eggs
4 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
1 c  Pecans
8    Empty beer cans
2 tb Soda
1 c  Dates
2 c  Beer
3 tb Butter
Remove tops from beer cans with can opener; lightly oil insides.  Sprinkle
soda on dates.  Heat beer to boiling and pour over date/soda mixture; set
aside to cool.  Cream together butter, maple syrup, vanilla, and eggs. Stir
in flour.  Add nuts and cooled date mixture.  Spoon batter into cans,
filling only 1/2 full.  Bake with cans standing up on cookie sheet, at 350
degrees for 15-30 minutes; look for tops to split and test for doneness. Do
not cut bread for 1 day; bread may break up, if it is sliced while still
warm.
