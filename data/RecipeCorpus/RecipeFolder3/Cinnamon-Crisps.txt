Title: Cinnamon Crisps
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 24 servings
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/8 ts Salt
24 ea Walnut halves
1 x  -Dottie Cross TMPJ72B
8 tb Unsalted butter; softened
1/3 c  Sugar
1 tb Sugar
1 ea Large egg yolk
1/2 ts Vanilla
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Butter 2 baking sheets. In a medium bowl,
using a hand-held electric mixer set at high speed, beat the butter until
creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and continue beating until the
mixture is light in color and texture, about 2 additional minutes. Beat in
the yolk and vanilla. Sift the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt
onto a sheet of waxed paper. Using a wooden spoon, work the dry ingredients
into the creamed mixture to form a stiff dough. Scrape the dough onto
another piece of waxed paper and form into a thick log about 8 inches long.
Wrap the log in the waxed paper and refrigerate until chilled and firm,
about 1 hour. Using a sharp knife, cut the chilled dough into 24 slices,
each about 5/6 inch thick. Arrange the slices about 2 inches apart on the
prepared baking sheets. Flatten the slices slightly with a fork, and top
each with a walnut half. Bake until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let
cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes, then transfer to wire cake racks
to cool completely. The cookies will keep, stored in an airtight container
at room temperature, for 3 days. Makes 24 cookies. Source: "An Edible
