"Fish and brewis (pronounced "brews") is one of the oldest traditional
dishes of Newfoundland. ... The fish in Fish and Brewis is salt cod and the
brewis is made from hardtack or hardbread, which is avilable everywhere in
Newfoundland and in specialized grocery stores across Canada. The dish is
always sprinkled with scrunchions, crisp fried bits of salt pork.
Fisherman's Brewis is sometimes the same as Fish and Brewis, but often the
fish and bread are chopped while hot and mixed together, or fresh cod is
used instead of salt cod."

Cut cod into serving-size pieces. Soak cod and hardbread separately in cold
water for 8 hours or overnight. Drain fish. In saucepan, cover fish with
cold water. Heat to boiling and boil gently for 15 to 20 minutes or until
tender; drain.
Meanwhile, in skillet, fry salt pork until golden. Brain breadand place
in saucepan, cover with salted water and bring to a full boil. Drain
immediately and serve with fish on warm plates. Sprinkle with scrunchions.
