Tire a la Melasse de Grand-Mere

Quebec's sweet tooth is often satisfied by this old-fashioned candy made
from molasses and sugar. This recipe belongs to Marguerite Legault, a
member of Les Fermieres de Thuroso, a rural woman's group in the town on
the Ottawa River.

In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine molasses, granulated and brown sugars
and water. Heat to boiling and stir to dissolve sugars. Let mixture boil,
without stirring, until syrup reaches the hard ball stage (260F/125C) on a
candy thermometer. Remove from heat, stir in butter, baking soda, and salt.
Immediately pour onto a buttered marble slab or baking sheet.
When cool enough to handle, butter hands and gather taffy into a ball.
Pull taffy between hands and continually stretch and fold again until taffy
turned lighter in colour (this can take from 5 to 15 minutes.)
Stretch and twist taffy into a rope about 1 inch thick and cut into
pieces using buttered scissors. Wrap each piece in waxed paper. MAKES:
