This is an excellent source of protein, carbohydrates, and (cooked in
butter or oil), fat.
Beat the egg, milk,vanilla, and cinnamon together in a flat dish such
as a soup plate or pie pan, that will accomodate the bread and make it
easy to remove the bread once it's wet. Add 1 slice of bread at a
time, turning so that both sides are coated and absorb some of the
liquid. Remove the bread, slice by slice, to a plate. Heat butter or
oil on a large griddle or skillet, reduce the heat, and brown the
bread briefly on each side. Serve with syrup, honey, cooked or raw
fruit, or plain.
