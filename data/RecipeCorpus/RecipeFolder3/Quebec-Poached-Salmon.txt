peppercorns, salt, onion and just enough hot water to cover the fish. Cover
and poach on top of the stove (if using frypan) over low heat, for 10-12

until the salmon flakes. Allow the fish to cool in the liquid. Drain well
and remove the skin. Arrange on platter, then cover completely with the
following sauce. Serve with a cucumber salad.

Sauce Verte: Chop the vegetables coarsely and put in blender with lemon
juice. Cover and blend until it turns iinto a sort of mush with small bits
of this and that in it. Add the mayonnaise and blend. If you don't have a
blender, chop the ingredients very finely and blend them into the
mayonnaise with the lemon juice, crushing them as much as possible to give
color to the sauce.

From the author, "Use salmon steaks for this colourful and tasty dish. It
is then easy to make it for 2 or 10."
