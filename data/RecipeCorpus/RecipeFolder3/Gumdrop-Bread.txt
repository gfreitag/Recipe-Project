Categories: Breads, Desserts, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 12 servings
3 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 c  Small gumdrops cut into 1/2
1/2 c  Chopped nuts
2 1/2 c  Flour
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Packed brown sugar
1/4 c  Shortening

Beat all ingredients except gumdrops and nut in a large mixer bowl on low
speed for 15 seconds. Beat on medium speed, scraping bowl constantly, 30
seconds. Stir in gumdrops and nuts. Pour into a 9 X 5 inch loaf pan that
has been greased on the bottom only. Bake at 350F for 60 to 65 minutes, or
until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Loosen sides of
loaf from the pan. Remove bread from the pan and cool completely on wire
rack. For best results, wrap and refrigerate at least 24 hours before
slicing. Refrigerate no longer than 1 week.
