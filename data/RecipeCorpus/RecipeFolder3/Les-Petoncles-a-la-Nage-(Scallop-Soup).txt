Les Petoncles a la Nage

Claude Cyr, chef-proprietor of Au cion del la baie in Metis sur Mer, makes
a simple soup from scallops and vegetables.

In a medium saucepan, bring wine, fish, stock and vegetables to a boil,
season with salt and pepper to taste. Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes or
until vegetables are tender-crisp. Place 6 scallops in each of 2 heated
bowls. Divide the very hot stock among the bowls, stir briefly and serve at
once. SERVES: 2
