"Potato scones reflect the influence of the Scottish in the Maritimes and
their adaptibility in using the famous P.E.I. potato...Scones were a
favorite Scottish tradition. According to _A Treasury of Nova Scotia
Recipes_ "the difference between bannock and scone (which the Scots rhyme
with 'on', not 'bone') is that the bannock is a rather large, round cake,
and the scone is a smaller triangle or 'farl'..But local usages vary
considerably, Scots being strong individualists.
A similar recipe for German Buns appears in an Ontario cookbook from the
Kitchener area, where German settlers were predominant.
When Their Majesties King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Government
House in Halifax on June 15,1939, scones were served. And Canadian Brits
gathered for "tea at the Empress" in Victoria for scones and tea.

In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt; cut in butter until
mixture resembles coarse meal. Beat eggs lightly; reserve 1 Tbsp. With
fork, stir into dry ingredients along with milk  and potatoes until well
moistened. Knead gently on a lightly floured surface about 20 times. Roll
or pat into circle 1/2 inch thick. Place onto ungreased baking sheet; brush
with reserved egg yolk and sprinkle with more sugar. Cut into 16 wedges,
separating slightly. Bake in 425F oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until
lightly browned. MAKES: 16 SCONES
