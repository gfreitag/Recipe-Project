9-inch-square baking dish. Sift the flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and
sugar into a bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces; cut it into the flour
mixture, using a pastry blender, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Cut the bread into 1-inch-square pieces. Soak the raisins in boiling water
to cover for about 5 minutes, until plump, the drain them. Combine the
bread, raisins, and sliced apples in a bowl. Sprinkle the bottom of the
prepared baking dish with 3/4 cup of the flour mixture, add the apple
mixture, and top with the remaining flour mixture. Bake, uncovered, in the
preheated oven until the top of the brown betty is crisp and golden and the
apples are tender, 35 to 45 minutes. To make the rum whipped cream: In a
chilled medium bowl, beat the cream and sugar until stiff. Beat in the rum.
Serve the betty warm, with the rum whipped cream. Serves 6. Sorce: "An
