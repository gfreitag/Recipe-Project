Make the pancakes in advance and set them in oven to keep them warm.
Poach or fry the eggs. To assemble the faces, place the pancakes on a
plate, with eggs for eyes, orange slices for ears and mouth, and a
tomato half for the nose.
NOTE: For a lighter meal, omit the eggs and use apricot or peach
halves for eyes and half a fresh cherry for a nose. Or, omit pancakes,
assemble eggs directly on plate, and add a smile made from chopped,
sauted potatoes.
