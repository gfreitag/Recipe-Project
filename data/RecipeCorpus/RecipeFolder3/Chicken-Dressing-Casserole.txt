Categories: Poultry, Casseroles, Dressings
Yield: 6 servings
2    Eggs - beaten
2 c  Chicken broth
1/3 c  Celery
1/3 c  Onion
1/2 c  Milk
2    Chickens - cooked and diced
1    6 oz pkg Stove Top herb
-flavor
1 cn Crm of mushroom soup
1/4 c  Margarine (melted)
Combine all ingredients - mix well. Put in greased 13x9 dish or pan. Bake
45 min at 350. Let stand 15 min. 8-10 servings.

"That's the official recipe but here's what I do. Since I'm so lazy I just
buy the boneless skinned chicken breasts and poach them in the microwave. I
don't use margarine, I use butter. It calls for 2 cups of broth but I just
use one 14 1/2 oz can - works fine. And I don't put mine in a 13x9 pan - do
you have any corning ware stuff? It fits real nice in their oval casserole
~ 2 quart I think." (Notes above by Chris)
