You can buy chernushka "black caraway" in some health food stores or from
mail-order. They are nothing like the familiar caraway seeds. This bread is
a New York specialty, usually made in bakeries.

1.  Combine 1/2 cup of the warm water, the yeast and sugar and let stand
until doubled in bulk, about 10 minutes. 2. Dissolve the salt in the
remaining warm water in a mixing bowl. Mix in the sourdough starter, then
the yeast mixture, then the gluten flour and 2 cups of the all-purpose
flour; make a soft dough. 3. Spread 1 1/2 cups flour on the kneading
surface and turn the dough out onto it. Knead, adding more flour if
necessary to make a soft dough that will hold its shape. Do not overknead..
the dough should be only slightly elastic, even a bit sticky. 4. Form the
dough into a ball and put in an ungreased bowl; cover with plastic, and let
rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. 5. Turn the dough out onto a
lightly flour surface and knead it a few strokes to expel air. Cover with a
towel and let rest for 15 minutes. 6. Divide the dough in half. Form each
half into a loaf by flattening in to an inch-thick oval about 12 inches
long, then rolling it up from one long side. Pinch the seam closed. Shape
the ends of the oval loaves neatly and plce them on two cornmeal-dusted
baking sheets, seam down. Cover with towels and let rise until
"three-quarters proofed," or not fully doubled.
