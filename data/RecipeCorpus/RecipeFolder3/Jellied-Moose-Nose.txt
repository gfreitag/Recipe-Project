Title: Jellied Moose Nose
Categories: Meats, Canadian
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Vinegar
1    Upper jawbone of a moose
1    Onion; sliced
1    Garlic clove
1 tb Mixed pickling spice
1.  Cut the upper jaw bone of the moose just below the eyes.

2.  Place in a large kettle of scalding water and boil for 45 minutes.

3.  Remove and chill in cold water.

4.  Pull out all the hairs - these will have been loosened by the boiling
and should come out easily ( like plucking a duck).

5.  Wash thoroughly until no hairs remain.

6.  Place the nose in a kettle and cover with fresh water.

7.  Add onion, garlic, spices and vinegar

8.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the meat is tender.
Let cool overnight in the liquid.

9.  When cool, take the meat out of the broth, and remove and discard the
bones and the cartilage.  You will have two kinds of meat, white meat
from the bulb of the nose, and thin strips of dark meat from along the
bones and jowls.

10. Slice the meat thinly and alternate layers of white and dark meat in a
loaf pan.

11. Reheat the broth to boiling, then pour the broth over the meat in the
loaf pan.

12. Let cool until jelly has set.  Slice and serve cold.

I must confess I have not yet tried this recipe, mainly for lack of a moose
nose...   But, sometime, maybe...
