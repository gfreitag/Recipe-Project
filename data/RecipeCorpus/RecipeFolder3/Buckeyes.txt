Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Confectioners sugar
1/4 c  Butter (at room temperature)
2 c  Crunchy peanut butter (gener
-ic works fine)
Mix well, roll into small balls and dip in mixture of 6 oz chocolate chips
(melted) and 1/4 stick of parafin.  let stand on rack for chocolate to drip
off and firm up. Alternatively, and lots quicker, pat peanut butter mixture
into a buttered pan, and top with melted chocolate chips, mark into SMALL
squares before chocolate gets totally firm.  After standing overnight cut.
These taste just   like the Reese's cups, and keep well in an airtight
cannister.
