Title: Greek Honey Cream with Fruits and Nuts
Categories: Desserts, Greek
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Honey
1 c  Chilled whipping cream
Mixed fresh fruit*
1/4 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts
1/4 c  Coarsely chopped almonds*
1/4 c  Coarsely chopped cashews
1/4 c  Coarsely chopped pistachios
*Note: Almonds should be blanched. ** Suggested fruits: berries, sliced
pears and apples.

Preheat oven to 325 F.  Place all nuts in baking pan.  Bake until lightly
toasted, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Cool completely.

Using electric mixer, beat honey in large bowl until thick and pale, about
2 minutes.  Whip cream in another large bowl until stiff peaks form.  Fold
nuts into cream.  Gently fold cream into honey, leaving a few steaks of
cream.  Cover and refrigerate until well chilled and slightly set, about 2
hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)

Place dollop of honey cream on each plate.  Surround with fruit and serve.
