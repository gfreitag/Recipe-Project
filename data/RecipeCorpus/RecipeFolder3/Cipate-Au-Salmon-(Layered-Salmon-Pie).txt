Cipate au Salmon

"This traditional salmon dish comes from Auberge La Msrtre, an inn on the
north coast near St. Anne des Monts. Proprietors Roger Fournier and Marie
France Crevier specialize in fish and game dishes."

Cut salt pork into thick strips and spread evenly in the bottom of a 2 qt
casserole. Dredge salmon lightly with flour. Arrange half the fish on the
salt pork. Sprinkle with half of the celery, onion and potato slices;
season with salt and pepper to taste.
Roll out half of the pastry, slightly thicker than normal, to fit the size
of the casserole. Cover potato layer with the pastry, cutting two large
vents. Pour in water through the vents until level with the pastry. Layer
with the remaining fish, celery, onion and potato to taste. Cover with top
pastry crust and again cut out two vents. Pour water in vents until level
with pastry.
Bake pie in a preheated 350F oven for 1 1/2 hours or till crust is
golden-brown. SERVES:4-6
