Title: Fried Spare Ribs with Honey
Categories: Ethnic, Pork/ham
Yield: 4 servings
5 tb Soy sauce
3 tb Sherry
4 c  Cooking oil
1 1/4 lb Pork ribs, trimmed
3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Vinegar
1.  Cut the ribs between the bones into single pieces. Heat the sugar,
vinegar, soy sauce, and sherry to a boil. Pour over the ribs and marinate
for at least one hour. 2. Heat the oil in a large wok. Add the ribs and fry
for 5 minutes or until golden brown. Turn off heat and allow to continue
cooking an additional 4 minutes. Remove, drain, and serve. The sweet sauce,
what we call honey, is our special touch. The ribs, if prepared perfectly,
will be crisp on the outside, sweet and tender on the inside.
