Tetes de Violon a l'Ail

The tiny, curled fronds of fern, which have gained a reputation as one of
Canada's national foods, come in a large part from the Matapedia River
valley. At Auberge La Coulee Douce in Causapcal, Suzanne Couisneau likes to
steam fiddleheads, then season then with garlic sauce.

Shake fresh fiddleheads in a paper bag until brown skins come off;
discard skins. Steam fresh or frozen, unthawed, fiddleheads until just
tender. Meanwhile, heat butter in heavy frying pan and saute garlic and
shallots until softened. Blend in soya sauce, sugar and wine. Add steamed
fiddleheads, turning to coat them well in sauce. Serve at once. SERVES:4
