"A traditional Atlantic chowder is made with fish or shellfish, canned
milk, potatoes, onions and is served with a dollop of butter. This version,
which comes from a Nova Scotia fisherman and uses sour cream, fresh cream
and thyme, is quite different and very good. When reheated leftover
chowder, it may be necessary to add a little more milk or cream, because
the fish and potatoes will have absorbed some of the liquid."

Cook the onion in the butter until transparent. Add the thyme and celery
salt. Remove from heat. In a saucepan, pour the whipping cream over the
fish fillets.Cover, bring to a boil and simmer slowly for 10 minutes or
till the fish flakes easily. Remove the fish with a slotted spoon, then
break into small pieces and remove any bones. Add the onion mixture and the
scallops to the poaching liquid. Bring to barely a boil, then simmer for
about 1 minute or till the scallops are opaque. If the chowder is not to be
eaten immediately, refrigerate everything at this stage. Just before
serving, add the fish, lobster, sour cream, potatoes and milk. Heat
through, but do not allow to boil. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into
soup bowls. Sprinkle with paprika. Serve immediately. SERVES: 4-6 from the
Zwicker Inn, Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia
