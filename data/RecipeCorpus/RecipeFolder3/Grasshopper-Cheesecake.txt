Categories: Beverages, Cheesecakes
Yield: 8 servings
1    9-in springform pan
------------------------CHOCOLATE COOKIE CRUMB CRUST------------------------
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1 1/2 c  Chocolate cookie crumbs
1/4 c  Melted butter
-------------------------------CHEESE FILLING-------------------------------
1/2 ts Salt
6    Eggs; separated
1 c  Sour cream
2 oz Semisweet chocolate
- grated to garnish
-  the top of the cake
1 lb Cream cheese
-at room temperature
1 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Green creme de menthe
3 tb Creme de cacao
2 tb Flour
CHOCOLATE COOKIE CRUMB CRUST: Combine chocolate cookie crumbs with melted
butter and cinnamon. Toss and mix well. Press into the bottom and partially
up the sides of the springform pan. Refrigerate and, while making the
filling, preheat the oven to 325F. CHEESE FILLING: Put the cream cheese in
a mixing bowl and beat until light and soft. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar and
mix well. Stir in the creme de menthe and the creme de cacao, flour and
salt. Beat until the mixture is blended well. Add the egg yolks and sour
cream, and beat until the batter is smooth and blended. Combine the egg
whites and 1/4 cup remaining sugar and beat until the whites stand in soft
peaks. Fold the beaten whites into the cream-cheese mixture. Pour the
batter into the crust and bake for about 1 hour, or until the cake has
puffed and trembles just slightly when shaken. A wooden skewer inserted in
the cake should come out almost clean, with just a trace of batter or moist
crumbs on it. Don't overbake; it will settle and firm somewhat as it cools.
Don't worry if the cake cracks as it bakes. Remove and cool. Refrigerate if
standing more than 4 hours. Garnish the top with grated chocolate.
