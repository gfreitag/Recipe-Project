"British Columbia has more than one no-bake square named after one of its
towns. The Squamish bar, peanutty and crisp with cereal, may be pretend to
be a cookie, but, just like its cousin, the Nanaimo bar, it's really candy
and should therefore be cut into very small squares and served as special
treats." Anne's note:I do not know whether there really is a "Squamish bar"
or if Canadian Living made this up.

In large saucepan over low heat, beat peanut butter, sugar and corn syrup
until blended and sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat, stir in rice
cereal and cornflakes. Press into lightly greased (" square cake pan; let
cool. Filling: In bowl, beat icing sugar and butter; beat in cream and
vanilla. Spread over cereal base, chill for 30 minutes. Topping: In double
boiler, over hot water, melt choclate and butter, let cool. spread evenly
over filling, chill for 20 minutes. Cut into squares. (Can be refrigerated
for up to 1 week or frozen up to 1 month. Let soften slightly before
serving.) MAKES: 36 SQUARES
