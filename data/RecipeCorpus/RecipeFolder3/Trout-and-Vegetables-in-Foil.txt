This delicious dish can be prepared for a noon campfire if the camp itself
has a blender or food processor in its kitchen or prepare before the trip
at home.  If the fish is to be a sizable one, be sure to take enough foil
in one piece; if the servings are to be individual for each guest, then cut
the foil accordingly.

Clean the trout and sprinkle inside and out with lemon juice, salt, pepper
and herbs.
Put vegetables through the food processor, mix well and strain.
Saute vegetables in butter until they are soft, and stuff each fish
before wrapping loosely in foil.
Place in ashes or on cookie sheet in 450 degree oven for 15-20 minutes.
Serve.
