Categories: Chocolate, Cakes/choc.

Sandi Brooks wfcj53b
1/4 lb Butter
1 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
1 c  +2T sour cream
2 c  Flour
Cream the butter and sugar. Add the eggs, one at a time. Add the sour cream
and vanilla. Beat until well blended. Sift together the dry ingredients. I
usually just blend them instead of sifting. Add them to the creamed
mixture. Mix well. Spoon about 1/2 the batter into a greased 10" tube pan.
Sprinkle batter with Choc. Chips. I use enough to ALMOST cover the batter.
Spoon the rest of the batter over the Choc. Chips. Sprinkle with remaining
Chips and Cinnamon sugar. Bake at 350 for 40-45 minutes or until cake
tester comes out clean.
