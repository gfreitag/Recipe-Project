Title: Baked Peameal Bacon
Categories: Canadian, Meats, Breads

1    Peameal Bacon, 1 centre cut
"Peameal bacon is a unique Canadian meat, pickled but unsmoked loin of pork
rolled in cornmeal. Usually it is sliced and fried for breakfast but it
excellent baked whole. The cornmeal makes a crisp exterior and the meat,
although quite lean, is particularly juicy, because of the pickling
process. For baking it is important to select a piece from the centre cut,
with a wide band of lean visible on both ends."

Place in an open roasting pan, fat side up. Bake at 350F degrees for 1- 1/2
hours. Serve hot in generous slices with baked beans if desired.
