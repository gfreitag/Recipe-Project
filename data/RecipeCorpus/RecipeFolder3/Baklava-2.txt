*Note: Almonds should be lightly toasted. Combine nuts, sugar, cinnamon and
nutmeg.  Brush a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan well with butter. Separate 25
phyllo sheets from package. Place under a smooth, damp towel to prevent
drying.  Wrap remaining filo well. Freeze for future use. Place one phyllo
sheet in pan. Trim to fit. Brush generously with melted butter. Repeat
procedure until there are 5 layers of buttered phyllo in the pan. Sprinkle
with 1/4 nut mixture. Repeat this procedure two more times, ending with
phyllo.  Drizzle any remaining butter over top.  Bake in 350 degree oven
1-1/2 hours or until golden brown.  Remove baklava from oven. Using a sharp
knife, immediately cut long, diagonal lines from corner to corner, forming
an "X".  Follow these guidelines to cut baklava into serving-size diamonds.
While still hot, pour cooled syrup over baklava. Syrup: Combine sugar,
water, orange and lemon rinds, cloves and cinnamon stick in saucepan. Bring
to boil.  Simmer, uncovered, about 5 minutes to thicken syrup slightly.
Remove from heat.  Discard spices. Stir in honey. Cool at room temperature.
Pour over hot baklava. Allow to stand overnight before serving.
