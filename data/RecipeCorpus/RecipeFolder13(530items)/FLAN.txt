Title: FLAN
Categories: Desserts, Mexican, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
2 C  Milk
1 t  Vanilla extract
3/4 C  Sugar
2    Eggs
2    Egg yolks
In a small kettle, heat about 3 T of sugar with about 1 t of water until
the mixture turns brown. Pour the mixture into 4 gelatin molds. Move the
molds around so that the mixture coats the interior. Set aside.

Mix the eggs, sugar, milk and the vanilla extract.  Pour the mixture into
the molds. Put the molds over a deep pan with water (double boiler or bain
marie technique) for 1 hr in a 350 degree F. oven. Keep the water in the
pan at the same level by adding boiling water. Cool and put it in the
refrigerator. Unmold the flan before serving.

NOTES:

*  A rich Mexican custard -- This recipe comes from the "Delicias
Culinarias" cookbook that I brought from Mexico.

*  You can substitute liquor for some of the milk to make the flan richer.
Personally, I use about 1 cup of milk and about 1 cup rompope (Mexican
eggnog).

*  Be careful when coating glass molds as they can break because of the
sudden change in temperatures. You have to do it fast as the mixture
hardens very quickly.
