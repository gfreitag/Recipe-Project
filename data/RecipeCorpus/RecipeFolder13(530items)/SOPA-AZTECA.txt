Title: SOPA AZTECA
Categories: Soups, Southwest, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
2 C  Consomme
1/4 lb Corn tortilla chips,
-crumbled
1/2 lb Monterey Jack cheese,
-cut into half-inch
-(or smaller) cubes
2 C  Cream of tomato soup
-(use the recipe of
-your choice,
-or open a can)
4 oz Green chilies, diced
-(or use more or
-less, to taste)
Mix soups and bring to a boil.  Fill each soup bowl about 1/3 full with
crumbled tortilla chips.  Place a layer of cheese cubes on top of the
chips. Put one or two spoonfuls of diced, drained chilies on top of the
cheese.

When ready to serve, ladle boiling soup on top of the mixture in the soup
bowls.  Do not stir.  Serve immediately.

The boiling soup melts the cheese, but it also begins to make the chips
soggy as soon as you pour it on. If you chop the cheese into finer cubes,
it will melt more quickly, but if you chop it too fine, or if you grate it,
then the cheese will form a layer on top of the soup instead of remaining
as distinct chunks.

NOTES:

*  Aztec soup:  a simple cheese, tomato and beef soup -- I got this recipe
from my mother, who got it from a friend in Tucson, Arizona.  The recipe is
extremely simple and extremely quick.  I like to serve it with Mexican
chef's salad. Serves 4-6.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
