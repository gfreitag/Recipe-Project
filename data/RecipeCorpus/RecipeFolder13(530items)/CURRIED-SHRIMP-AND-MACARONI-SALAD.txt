NOTES:

*  A cold pasta dish -- This salad is quick and easy.  It's best if made
several hours  before serving, to get the full curry flavor.  It's been a
real hit at potlucks. Yield: serves 4 to 6.

*  A honeydew ball is a ball of honeydew melon that is scooped out of the
flesh of the melon with a "balling spoon" or "melon baller."  About 1 1/3
cups of conchiglie will make about three cups of cooked macaroni.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  25 minutes (includes time to cook macaroni and make melon balls.)
: Precision:  no need to measure.
