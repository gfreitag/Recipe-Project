Title: IRISH'S CRAB BUTTER
Categories: Dips, Party, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
Cocktail sauce
2 T  Lemon juice
1/2 t  Garlic, crushed (or a
-pinch of instant garlic)
1 T  Worcestershire sauce
1/2 C  Butter
1 C  Cream cheese
1/4 C  Mayonnaise
6 oz Crab meat
1 lg Onion, chopped fine
Allow butter and cream cheese to soften before starting.  Mix mayo, butter
and cream cheese. Do not use a blender, as the mixture will get soupy. Add
lemon juice, garlic, worcestershire sauce, pepper, etc. to taste.

Mix in crab (or whatever) and onion.  Of the choices, I feel crab is the
best. Chill at least two hours, cover with cocktail sauce. This is an
important part of the recipe.

I recommend Wakefield crab meat, Shrimp or Shrimp & Crab.  I usually use
Crosse & Blackwell's cocktail sauce, but feel free to use any kind that you
trust.  You can make your own simple cocktail sauce by mixing 3 parts
catsup to 1 part horseradish and adding tabasco, garlic, worcestershire
sauce to taste.

Serve over Triscuits (they're nice and strong, to survive heavy scooping)
or veggies. Irish is the friend from whom I got this recipe.

NOTES:

*  Incredible crab or shrimp dip -- My first encounter with this dip came
at a New Year's party a few years ago. I was standing by the munchies table
trying not to embarrass myself too much, when a woman came up to me and
pointed out this dip. She explained to me that at a previous party she had
lost control eating it and got a spoon!

It's incredibly rich, and requires a lot of will power not to eat too much.
Yield:  Serves 6 gluttons.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 2 hours cooling.
