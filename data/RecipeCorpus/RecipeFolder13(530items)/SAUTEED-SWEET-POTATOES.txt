Title: SAUTEED SWEET POTATOES
Categories: Vegetables, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 C  Lime juice
3 T  Sugar
2 lg Sweet potatoes
1/4 lb Butter (1 stick)
2/3 C  Tequila
Grate the sweet potatoes into pieces about 1 inch long and about 1/4 inch
thick.  Saute the sweet potatoes in the butter for 5 minutes.

Add the tequila, lime juice and sugar, and cook covered, over moderate
heat, for 5 minutes.

NOTES:

*  Sweet potatoes sauteed in lime and tequila -- Rose's lime juice, a
common brand, has a substantial amount of added sugar. Try to find lime
juice without added sugar, or leave all the sugar out of the recipe if you
can't find it. Naturally you will get the best results if you squeeze fresh
limes to get the lime juice.

: Difficulty:  trivial.
: Time:  10 to 15 minutes, most of it spent grating the potatoes.
: Precision:  No need to measure.
