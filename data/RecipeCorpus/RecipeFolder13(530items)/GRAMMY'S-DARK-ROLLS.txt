cooled batter, then mix in dissolved yeast.

Add flour until dough is just soft enough to knead.  Knead lightly.  Place
dough in a greased bowl; cover with a damp cloth.  Let rise in warm place
until  doubled in bulk; about one hour.

Punch down dough and cut into 12 equal pieces.  Shape each piece into a

Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 40 minutes.

NOTES:

*  Holiday rolls with oatmeal and molasses -- This recipe has long been
part of my Thanksgiving tradition. I have long since forgotten its source.

*  These rolls are really wonderful, but they need time to rise.  start
them as early in the day as possible. Don't even think about using the
quick-rise yeasts.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  several hours preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
