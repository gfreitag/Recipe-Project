Categories: Entrees, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
---------------------------------DUMPLINGS---------------------------------
6    Garlic cloves,
-crushed, minced
-or pressed
1 T  Brown sugar
1 T  Sesame oil
1 pk Wonton wrappers
Peanut oil
2 lb Turkey, ground
1 1/2 t  Cornstarch (cornflour)
1 1/2 t  Sherry, dry
3 T  Light soy sauce
1 T  Ginger, grated
-or finely chopped
6    Green onions, chopped
-------------------------------DIPPING SAUCE-------------------------------
6    Garlic cloves, finely
-minced or pressed
1 T  Ginger, finely
-minced or grated
1 T  Red pepper, crushed
1 1/2 C  Fish sauce (You may
-want to dilute this
-with water, depending
-on its strength)
1 C  Vinegar
1 C  Sugar
Make the dipping sauce by mixing together all of its ingredients.  Store in
the refrigerator until you are ready to use it.

Stir together everything but the wrappers and the peanut oil.  Mix
vigorously by hand until it begins to bind together. (About 1 minute or
so.)

Place about 1 1/2 - 2 T of filling in the middle of a wonton wrapper.  Fold
the sides up around the meat so that you have a little bag or cup.  Press
the bottom flat so that the bag doesn't fall over.

Oil racks of the steamer with peanut oil.  Place dumplings in racks.  Steam
for 15 to 20 minutes in covered rack over boiling water.  Serve hot with
dipping sauce.

NOTES:

*  Steamed dumplings (meatballs) -- This recipe is an adaptation of the one
in "The Frugal Gourmet" by Jeff Smith. The bigger the batch, the better.
There are never leftovers. Yield: makes 35-40.

*  These little gems would probably go just fine with a favorite hoisin or
chili dipping sauce.

*  The steamer racks I recommend are the Chinese bamboo ones.  You can
stack them quite nicely (I find that three racks work well) and they sit at
just the right height above the boiling water in a wok. The real advantage
is that water will not condense on your food if you use a bamboo steamer.

*  The dipping sauce is an adaption of one served at the Phoenix Vietnamese
restaurant in Saint Paul Minnesota; it was originally served with egg
rolls, but works splendidly with these dumplings.

*  The original recipe calls for ground pork, but I find ground turkey
preferable.  The flavor is lighter and the calories far fewer.  Pork is
fine, though, and even hamburger could be used in a pinch.

: Difficulty:  easy, but tedious.
: Time:  45 minutes preparation, 15-20 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
