Title: GERMAN FRIENDSHIP CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Sourdough, Usenet
Yield: 1 cake
1 C  Cake starter
--------------------------------STARTER FOOD--------------------------------
1 C  Sugar
1 C  Milk
1 C  Flour, self-raising
------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
2    Eggs
1/2 C  Raisins
1/2 C  Nuts (or other fruits)
15 oz Pineapple chunks,
-drained (one can)
2 C  Flour, self-raising
1 C  Sugar
2/3 C  Oil
2 t  Cinnamon
2 t  Vanilla extract
PREPARE STARTER:

Day 1:  Blend the starter feed together, and then hand mix in the starter.
I find it easiest to mix the flour and sugar together dry, add the milk
to the starter, and then slowly add the flour and sugar to the liquid. The
starter should never be beaten with a blender or refrigerated. Pour the
mixture into a large bowl, cover with cling-film or a damp towel, and leave
to brew.

Day 2:  Thoroughly mix the sourdough, then leave to brew again.

Day 5:  As day 1

Day 6:  As day 2

Day 10:  Print off three copies of this recipe.  Here now is why this is
called a friendship cake.  Take 3 cups of Sourdough mixture, and give them
away with copies of the recipe  as starters to your friends. Then proceed
with the baking.

MAKING THE CAKE:  Blend all ingredients thoroughly with remaining starter.
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Pour mixture into a well-greased baking
tin. Bake for 1 3/4 hours (less in a fan oven), cool.

NOTES:

*  A 10-day Sourdough cake -- This is known as the friendship cake, it's a
bit like a chain letter in that you have to find a set of friends to pass
on the starter to.

During preparation put the starter into a very large bowl (it foams up),
and cover with a lid or with cling film. Yield: Starter and one cake.

*  If you don't get cake starter from a friend, you can probably buy it in
a baking supply store.

*  Vary the spices to taste.  The cake is quite pleasant if you forget
them.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 days brewing starter, 30 minutes preparing cake, 2 hours baking
and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
