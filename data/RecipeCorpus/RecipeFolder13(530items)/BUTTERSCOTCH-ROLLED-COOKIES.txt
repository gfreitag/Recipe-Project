1/2 t  Baking powder
1/4 t  Baking soda

-(optional)

-slightly beaten
1 T  Butter, melted
Mix sugar, salt and butter thoroughly.  Add egg and vanilla and beat till
fluffy.

Sift flour, baking powder, soda and cinnamon and add to mixture.  Chill
well, several hours, or overnight.

MAKE THE GLAZE:  Mix the glaze ingredients together until smooth.

and bake on ungreased cookie sheet for 8-10 minutes at 350 degrees F.  Let
cool and glaze.

NOTES:

*  Rolled cookies for the Christmas holidays -- I almost never make these
cookies except at Christmas time.  They just seem to be Christmas cookies.
(I did make a batch of heart shaped ones last Valentine's day for my
then-fiance.)  I usually make these cookies in  Christmas shapes and frost
them with green and red frosting.  This is a good recipe for kids to help
out with.

*  It helps to keep most of the dough in the refrigerator while you are
cutting shapes.  It cuts much better when it is cold.

*  These are time-consuming and fairly difficult, but worth it.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, overnight chill, 1 hour cutting and
baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
