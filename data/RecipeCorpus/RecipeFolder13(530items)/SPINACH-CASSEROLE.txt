Title: SPINACH CASSEROLE
Categories: Casseroles, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
2 T  Flour
Cheddar or parmesan cheese
-(between 1-2 C), grated
Salt
Pepper
10 oz Spinach, chopped
-(frozen or fresh)
2 T  Butter (or margarine)
1 sm Onion, chopped
Yogurt, plain
-(between 1-2 C)
Rinse and chop the spinach.  Place the chopped spinach in a heavy skillet,
cover, and steam until wilted, stirring occasionally.  There is no need to
add water other than what clings to the leaves from washing. (If you are
using frozen spinach, place over low or medium heat to thaw and allow
excess water to evaporate.) Transfer to small bowl.

In a skillet, melt the butter (or margarine).  Add the onion and cook until
soft.  Add the flour and stir for 1 minute over medium heat.  Season the
mixture to taste with salt and pepper, and then gradually whisk in the
yogurt.

Add the spinach and turn to coat the leaves.  Remove from heat and blend in
the cheese.  Pour into a greased 8x4-inch loaf pan, and bake for 20 minutes
at 350 degrees F.

grated cheese.
