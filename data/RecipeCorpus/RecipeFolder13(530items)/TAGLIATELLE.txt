Title: TAGLIATELLE
Categories: Pasta, Usenet
Yield: 3 servings
6 T  Double cream
4 oz Bacon (chopped)
Salt
Pepper, freshly-milled
15 oz Tagliatelle
3 oz Butter
2    Egg yolks
2 T  Parmesan, grated
Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, add some salt and a few drops
of oil and cook the tagliatelle for 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt about 1 oz of butter in a small pan and cook the chopped
bacon for 3-4 minutes.

Beat the egg yolks together with the remainder of the butter, the Parmesan
cheese, the cream and some freshly-milled black pepper. Drain the
tagliatelle and put it back in the pan quickly so as not to lose heat.

Add the bacon and its juices to the pasta, pour in the egg and cream
mixture and toss well. (If you've done this quickly enough, the heat from
the pasta will cook the egg yolks to a creamy sauce). Season with salt and
pepper if desired, then serve with more Parmesan.

Serve accompanied with green vegetables such as courgettes (zucchini) or
leeks, or with a green salad.

NOTES:

*  Tagliatelle with bacon and cream -- A quick yet rich recipe, originally
published in the recipe column in _BBC Radio Times_ magazine.

*  For aesthetic reasons, green tagliatelle looks best when served.

*  "Double cream" is a product not normally available in North America.  It
has 40 percent butterfat; "whipping cream" has 30 percent butterfat.  If
you make this recipe with whipping cream instead of double cream, then use
about 1 T more butter.

: Difficulty:  moderate (timing is critical).
: Time:  15 minutes.
