NOTES:

*  Don't expect good results with instant grits, use real grits.

*  Editor's note:  grits are ground or cracked hominy.  Hominy is an
American Indian food, which is made from dried corn. There is virtually no
substitute for it, and it is hard to get outside North America. It is a
very popular food in the southern U.S. In parts of Mexico it is known as
nixtamal or sometimes pozole.
