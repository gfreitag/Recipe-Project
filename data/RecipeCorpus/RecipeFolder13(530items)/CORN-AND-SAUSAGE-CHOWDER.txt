Categories: Soups, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
4 C  Corn
2 C  Potatoes, cubed
-(about 1/4")
1/8 t  White pepper
Red pepper sauce
2 C  Milk
2 T  Butter
1    Polish sausage,
-sliced thinly
6 sl Bacon, chopped
1 C  Onions, chopped
1/4 C  Flour
2 C  Chicken stock
1 C  Water
In a big saucepan, brown the sausage and bacon until bacon is crispy.
Remove sausage and bacon with a slotted spoon, and drain on a paper towel.
Discard most of the fat; leave enough to cook the onion. Saute onion in
reserved fat until tender, about 5 minutes.

Gradually stir in the flour.  Add stock and water, stirring constantly. Add
sausage, bacon, corn, potatoes and white pepper.  Add red pepper sauce to
taste.  Heat to boiling.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 15 to 20
minutes.  Stir occasionally.

Add milk and cook until soup is heated through and potatoes are tender. Top
with butter and serve.

NOTES:

*  A rich creamy chowder with corn and sausages -- This chowder is a
variation on a family recipe from an old roommate of mine. (She makes it
without the sausage, and with more water). It goes very well with most
seafood.  I am especially fond of it served with crab cakes. Yield: Serves
6-8.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
