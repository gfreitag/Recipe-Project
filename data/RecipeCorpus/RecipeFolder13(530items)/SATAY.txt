Cut meat into strips, pound meat, then cut into cubes and season with  meat
tenderizer.  Pound separately garlic, onions, lemon grass and langkuas. Mix
together meat, pounded ingredients, salt and sugar.  Marinate for at least
4 hours, preferably overnight.

Thread meat onto skewers.  Sprinkle oil mixture (1/2 oil, 1/2 water) over
meat and grill until done.

MAKE GRAVY:

Make the tamarind paste:  add the tamarind to water and soak for  2 hours.
During this time, squeeze the tamarind so that it becomes  pulpy.  Filter
the liquid through a strainer to remove seeds, stem and skin of the fruit.

Pound the onions, garlic and lengkuas.  Roast the peanuts, remove skins and
grind finely.

Fry the shrimp paste on medium heat for a few minutes.  Add the  onion and
garlic paste to the frying pan.  Fry the onions until white.  Don't brown
them.  Add the lemon grass, lengkuas, dried chilies, peanuts, sesame seeds,
coconut milk, sugar, salt and tamarind paste.  Cook until the gravy is
thick.
