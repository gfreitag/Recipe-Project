NOTES:

*  Fish in a hot garlic/pecan sauce -- The Cajun Cafe in Portland Oregon
serves a sauce whose recipe they got under license from K-Paul's in New
Orleans.  They devoutly refused to answer all of my questions about the
sauce or its ingredients, so I've tried to formulate it on my own, at home.
This stuff doesn't taste exactly like what the restaurant serves, but it's
delicious in its own right.  Maybe it's best to title the recipe "fish with
something not entirely unlike hot fanny sauce."

This sauce is best served with a moderately strong fish:  I would recommend
sturgeon, swordfish, or tuna.

*  If you are cooking more pieces of fish than will fit in the skillet at
once, make the sauce ahead, put it aside (keep warm) and add it before
cooking each piece of fish.

*  Serve with a simple rice or pasta dish.  I use saffron rice with snow
peas, or linguine with shrimp meat and pesto.
