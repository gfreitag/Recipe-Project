Title: FRENCH HERB BLEND
Categories: Condiments, Herbs, Usenet
Yield: 2 cups
5 T  Chives (freeze-dried),
-chopped
2 T  Orange rind,
-desiccated
2 T  Celery seed, ground
1/2 C  Tarragon
1/2 C  Chervil
2 T  Sage leaves
1/2 C  Thyme
2 T  Rosemary
Dump everything together and mix until well-combined.  Pack into small jars
and label (the now-empty spice jars that held the ingredients are a good
size).  Store in a cool dry place.  Crumble spices in hand when using.
Measure spices by volume, not by weight, because of the large variation in
moisture content.

NOTES:

*  A French-style mixture of herbs and seeds -- I found this in some
magazine many many years ago. I usually make it every year or so and give
it  to people as presents. The recipients are continually asking either for
the recipe or refills. This goes well in soups and similar things but is
especially good in scrambled eggs.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
