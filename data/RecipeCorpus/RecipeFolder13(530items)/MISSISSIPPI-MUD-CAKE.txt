Title: MISSISSIPPI MUD CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Usenet
Yield: 1 cake
1 1/2 C  Flour
1/8 t  Salt
1 1/2 C  Peanuts, chopped
2 C  Miniature marshmallows
1 C  Margarine
1/2 C  Cocoa
2 C  Sugar
4    Eggs, slightly beaten
1 t  Vanilla
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Melt the margarine in a saucepan.  Add the cocoa
and stir until blended. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the sugar,
eggs, vanilla, and mix them all together.

Combine the flour, salt and the nuts in a bowl, and stir so that the nuts
are coated with the flour. Add this gradually to the mixture in the
saucepan.

Spoon this into a greased 13 x 9 x 2 pan and bake for 35-40 minutes in the
preheated oven.  Spread the marshmallows on the warm cake.

When the cake cools, you will notice the reasoning behind its name.  It may
not look like much, but it sure tastes great.
