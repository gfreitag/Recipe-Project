Title: EGGS AND MUSHROOMS
Categories: Entrees, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1 sm Onion, chopped
1/2 t  Parsley, dried
Salt and pepper
-(to taste)
2 T  Butter, melted
3/4 C  Monterey Jack
-cheese, grated
4 lg Eggs
2 T  Butter
1/2 lb Mushrooms (fresh),
-sliced
2 T  Flour
1/2 C  White cooking wine
1/2 C  Chicken broth
3 T  Mayonnaise
Saute mushrooms in about 2 tablespoons butter.  Stir in flour.  Blend well.
Add wine, broth, mayonnaise, onion, parsley, salt and pepper.  Cook,
stirring until sauce is smooth.

Pour sauce in shallow baking dish.  Break eggs over sauce, taking care not
to break the yolk (it makes serving easier if the eggs are distributed
symmetrically in the dish.) Pour about 2 tablespoons melted butter over
eggs. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F. until eggs are cooked to
your liking. (I like the yolks hard, so I bake for about 20 minutes.)

NOTES:

*  Eggs poached in mushroom sauce -- I got this recipe off the side of a
bottle of cooking wine (which I had purchased for another recipe).  It
turned out to be so good that I used up the rest of the bottle in repeat
performances.

*  If you use ordinary white wine instead of cooking wine, add about 1/2
teaspoon of salt to it.

*  You can use any mild cheddar cheese in place of the Monterey Jack.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10-20 minutes baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
