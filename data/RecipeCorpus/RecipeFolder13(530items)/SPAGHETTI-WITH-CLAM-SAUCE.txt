Categories: Pasta, Seafood, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
8    Garlic cloves, minced
1 t  Parsley
1 t  Oregano
1 t  Salt
1 lb Spaghetti
1 T  Cooking oil
1/4 C  Parmesan cheese, grated
24 oz Clams (canned), with
-juice (2 standard cans)
8 oz Tomato paste
-(1 standard can)
1 lb Tomatoes (canned),
-with liquid
4 T  Butter, clarified
Saute the garlic in about 2 T of clarified butter until lightly browned.
Stir in the clam juice, tomato paste, tomatoes and liquid, parsley and
oregano. Simmer until reduced by about half. Add the clams and remove from
heat. This sauce should be reheated just prior to serving.

Cook and drain the spaghetti.  In the empty cooking pot, melt the remaining
clarified butter, and return the spaghetti to the pot and stir until coated
uniformly.  Serve with lots of garlic bread and a dry white wine.

"Lowbush Moose (and other Alaskan recipes)" by Gordon R.  Nelson.  I've
modified it somewhat.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.

*  You can use oil instead of clarified butter, at some sacrifice in
flavor.
