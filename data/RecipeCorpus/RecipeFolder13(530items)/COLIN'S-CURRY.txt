MAKE CURRY:  Fry the onion in a heavy casserole in the corn oil until it
begins to soften.  Stir in the garlic, ginger and chilies.  Reduce heat and
fry gently for awhile.

Meanwhile, toast the hard seeds and cinnamon in a dry heavy frying pan
until they begin to pop. Grind the toasted seeds into a fine powder and add
to the frying mixture together with the chile powder and the turmeric.

Add the chopped tinned tomatoes and stir in with about 1 t salt.  If the
mixture is dry, add a little water or stock.  Cover and allow to simmer
gently for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Trim the fat off the pre-cooked meat and cut into bite sized pieces.  When
the sauce has simmered for the 2 hours, switch off and stir in the meat.
Leave to stand preferably overnight, and re-heat before eating.

MAKE RICE:  Heat corn oil in a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Add
cloves, crushed cardamom pods and cinnamon.  Add rice and turmeric and mix
well by swishing the pan round.  Add boiling water and bay leaf and stir.

Cover and simmer gently for 12-15 minutes, until all the water has been
absorbed.  Use a fork to remove the seeds and bay leaf and turn out into a
warmed dish.  Allow to stand in a warm place for 5 to 10 minutes and fluff
up with a fork before serving.

The sauce can be prepared in advance, to use with leftover meat, or you can
NOTES:

*  An Indian-style meat curry -- Having experimented with making
Indian-style dishes for a long time, I have found that this one works every
time and has met with approval from all who have tried it. Yield: Serves
3-4.

*  cook the meat and sauce to order.

*  Plain yoghurt may be substituted for the tomatoes if preferred.

*  Experiment with the seasonings.  As a guide, ginger and chile powder
will increase the heat, coriander will increase the sweetness, and
fenugreek and cumin will increase the bitterness.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 hours cooking, overnight wait.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
