Heat the olive oil in a large ovenproof frying pan.  Crush the garlic and
saute for 15-20 minutes.  Be careful not to burn the garlic.

Clean and trim chicken, leaving the skin on.  Add to frying pan, then add
salt and pepper. Cook on medium heat until the chicken begins to brown.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the vinegar and bring to a boil.  Partially cover, lower heat, and cook
until the liquid is reduced to the original volume.  Add crushed rosemary
to taste. Add wine and sugar, return to boil, reduce heat, and cook
partially covered until the liquid is again reduced to its original volume.
Bake at 350 degrees F. for 15-20 minutes or until brown.

NOTES:

*  Southern-Italian style baked chicken -- This is one of my favorite
recipes. It was recommended by a very close friend who got it from an old
cookbook.
It is very easy and can be whipped up on short notice. I really like it
for its garlic and wine taste.

*  I usually use a white California Zinfandel wine.
