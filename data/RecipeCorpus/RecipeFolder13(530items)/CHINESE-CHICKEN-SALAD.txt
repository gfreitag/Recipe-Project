shred it.

Deep-fry the bean thread in small batches in about 2 cups oil.  Drain.

Shred the green onions and lettuce.  Cut the coriander into about 1-inch
lengths.  Place the chicken, lettuce, green onions and coriander in a large
bowl.  Mix in the dry mustard.  Add the sesame oil, oil, soy sauce,
vinegar, sesame seeds and bean thread. Mix well. Serve.

NOTES:

*  Chicken salad with Chinese seasonings -- This is a delicious salad my
mother has been making for years.  She found the recipe in the cookbook
that came with her wok. If you leave out the fried bean threads, this is a
reasonably low-calorie dish.  And if you use all vegetable oils, there's
almost no cholesterol in it (except for what's in the chicken).  Yield:
serves 3-4.

*  You can add garlic and ginger to the salad dressing that goes on the
salad.

*  This is also good hot, heat it just enough to get it hot and serve
immediately.
