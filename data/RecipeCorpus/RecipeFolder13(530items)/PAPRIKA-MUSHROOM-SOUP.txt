NOTES:

*  A rich dill, paprika and mushroom soup -- I first saw this at "Old Wives
Tale," a restaurant in Portland, Oregon.  The waiter there said that this
had been on the menu every day for a year, and highly recommended it. The
soup was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised to find a recipe for it in
Molly Katzen's "Moosewood Cookbook." Yield: Serves 3-4.

*  Tamari is a kind of soy sauce; if you can't find it, you can use
ordinary soy sauce.
