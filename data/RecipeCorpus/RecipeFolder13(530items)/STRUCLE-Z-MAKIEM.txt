POPPY SEED FILLING
-----------------------------------ICING-----------------------------------
2 T  Lemon juice
1 C  Sugar, powdered
MAKE THE DOUGH:  Soften the yeast in warm water in a bowl.  Mix flour with
sugar and salt.  Cut in the butter until mixture has a fine, even crumb.

Beat eggs and extra yolks; mix with yeast, then stir into the flour
mixture. Add the sour cream and the vanilla and mix well.

Knead dough on floured surface for 5 minutes.  Divide in half and roll each
half into a 12 inch square.  Cover.

MAKE THE FILLING:  Melt butter in a large pan.  Add poppy seed and stir-fry
for 3 minutes.  Add honey, lemon juice and raisins to poppy seeds.  Cover
and remove from heat. Let stand for 10 minutes.

Beat egg whites with sugar until stiff moist peaks form.  Fold in orange
and lemon peels and then gently fold in poppy seed mixture.

Spread half of the filling on each dough square (after you uncover them).
Roll up as you would for a jelly-roll and seal the edges.  Place on greased
baking sheets and cover.  Let rise until doubled in bulk (approx. 1 1/2
hours).

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Bake about 45 minutes, then remove from
oven and cool.

MAKE THE ICING:  Mix powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth.  Spread
this mixture evenly over the rolls.

NOTES:

*  Poppy seed rolls -- This recipe could be used as part of a 12-course
meal known in Polish as Wigilia, or on its own. Wigilia is eaten after
sundown on Christmas Eve. Yield: Makes 2 rolls.

*  You can grind poppy seeds in a mortar and pestle.  Specialty food stores
sell grinders specifically designed for poppy seeds.  Some spice shops sell
poppy seeds already ground, but like all spices they lose their freshness
much more rapidly after they are ground. This year (1987) in Poland, the
people are having a very hard time finding enough poppy seeds for their
strucle z makiem because there is a government crackdown on the growing of
all poppies in an attempt to control opium production.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
