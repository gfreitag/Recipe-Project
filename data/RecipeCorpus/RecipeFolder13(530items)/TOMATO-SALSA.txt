Title: TOMATO SALSA
Categories: Condiments, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
1/4 C  Basil leaves, slivered
4    Plum tomatoes, ripe
-(seeded and diced tiny)
1/4 C  Purple onion, peeled
-and cut into tiny dice
1 1/2 t  Ginger root,
-peeled and grated
1 T  Balsamic vinegar
1/4 C  Olive oil
Salt and white pepper
2    Scallions (cleaned,
-about 3 inches green
-left on, slivered
-lengthwise)
1/3 C  Lemon juice, fresh
1/2 lb Cilantro (typically
-2 bunches; use the
-leaves only)
2    Garlic cloves (peeled
-and finely minced)
In a small bowl, soak scallions in lemon juice for 30 minutes.  Drain
scallions; reserve half of the lemon juice.  Mince the scallions.

In a medium-sized bowl, combine minced scallions, reserved lemon juice and
remaining ingredients.  Mix together well.  Serve over grilled, broiled or
roasted chicken or fish.

NOTES:

*  Tomato salsa for chicken or fish -- This makes a very flavorful topping
for broiled chicken or fish. I got it from a column in the local paper
about bright young chefs. The recipe is from chef Cincy Pawlcyn at Mustards
Grill, Yountville, CA. Yield: serves 6 to 8.

*  The original recipe calls for double this amount of olive oil, but that
seemed excessive.

: Difficulty:  easy if you have a food processor.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 30 minutes soaking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
