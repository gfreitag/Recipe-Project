NOTES:

*  Pork ribs in peach tomato barbecue sauce -- Moons ago my Mom made this
for all us kids. Wouldn't eat it (ribs & peaches? YUCHH!). Years
(literally) passed. Well, if you hadn't guessed, when I tried it, I decided
to post it to the net (as soon as I grew up). Yield: Serves 4 to 6.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 1/2 hours cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
