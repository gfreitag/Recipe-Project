Title: SOUTHERN STYLE PORK CHOPS
Categories: Meats, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 C  Mushroom soup, condensed
-(or make a mushroom-
-flavored white sauce)
1 t  Worcestershire sauce
1 t  Salt
1/8 t  Black pepper
4    Pork chops,
-about 1/2 inch
Shortening or oil
4    Onion slices (we
-like these fairly thick)
1/4 C  Peanut butter
1/4 C  Milk
In a frying pan big enough to hold all of the chops at once,  brown pork
chops on both sides in a little shortening or oil. Pour off fat, leaving
chops in frying pan. Place an onion slice on top of each chop.

Mix peanut butter, mushroom soup, milk, Worcestershire sauce, salt and
pepper. Pour over chops. Cover and simmer over medium to low heat for 45
minutes. You may want to move the chops around in the pan from time to time
to keep them from sticking.

Smooth peanut butter is best.  The chunky variety gives a strange
consistency to this dish.

NOTES:

*  Pork chops in mushroom peanut-butter sauce -- I originally found this
recipe in the "Woman's Day Encyclopedia of Cookery."  It is very easy to
prepare and makes a hearty main dish served over rice or noodles.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes browning, 45 minutes simmering.
