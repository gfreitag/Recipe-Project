Title: SALMON-SPINACH LOAF
Categories: Fish, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
10 3/4 oz Mushroom soup,
-condensed (1 can)
1 C  Cornflakes (uncrushed)
1/4 C  Flour, all-purpose
1 lb Salmon (1 large can)
3/4 lb Spinach, fresh
2    Eggs
2 T  Onion, grated
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Rinse spinach thoroughly.  Cook spinach
with a small amount of water for 5-10 minutes, or until tender. Discard
cooking water.

Clean salmon as desired and drain excess liquid.  Place salmon, spinach,
eggs, undiluted soup, cornflakes, flour and onion in large mixing bowl.
Beat with electric mixer at medium speed for about three minutes or until
ingredients are chopped and mixture is blended. Stop to scrape bowl and
beaters as needed.

Grease a 9x5x2 1/2-inch loaf pan and pack the mixture in.  Bake for 40 to
50 minutes or until set and lightly browned. Cool slightly before serving.
Do not try to unmold; serve directly from baking pan. The finished loaf
will have the consistency of spoonbread.

NOTES:

*  A baked salmon and spinach loaf -- This recipe is a pleasant compromise
between a salmon loaf and a spinach souffle.  It can be made with stale
spinach and canned salmon.  It does not have a strong flavor or texture of
spinach, as do some cooked spinach dishes.

*  You can substitute concentrated dried cream-of-mushroom soup for canned
condensed soup, or use a thick flavored white sauce.

*  There is no point in using good-quality salmon in this recipe; chum or
pink salmon are fine.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
