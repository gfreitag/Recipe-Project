NOTES:

*  A Mexican meat and bean dish, similar to chili -- I got this recipe from
"A Primer on Bean Cookery" by the California Dry Bean Advisory Board. While
not a true chili, chalupa is a Mexican-American favorite for a hearty lunch
or supper. It may be made ahead and reheated, and it freezes well.

*  Chili powder is a mixture of spices, consisting mainly of ground dried
chili peppers.  This recipe may be served with corn chips and condiments
(including chopped tomato, chopped avocado, chopped onion, shredded
lettuce, grated cheddar cheese and hot sauce).

: Difficulty:  Easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 5-6 hours cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
