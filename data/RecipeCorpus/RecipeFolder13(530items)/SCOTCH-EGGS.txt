Title: SCOTCH EGGS
Categories: Entrees, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
6    Eggs, hard-boiled
----------------------------------COVERING----------------------------------
1 T  Mustard
1/4 t  Black pepper
1 lb Sausage meat
1/2 C  Rolled oats
----------------------------------COATING----------------------------------
2    Eggs, beaten
1 C  Bread crumbs
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

MAKE THE COVERING:  Mix all ingredients thoroughly and divide into six
portions.  Cover the eggs:  uniformly cover each hard boiled egg with its
portion of the sausage mixture.

BREAD THE COVERED EGGS:  Roll each egg in bread crumbs, then into beaten
egg, and once again in bread crumbs. Set eggs on a cookie sheet and bake
for 15 minutes. Turn them over and bake another 15 minutes. Serve sliced in
half.

NOTES:

*  Hard-boiled eggs in a sausage/oatmeal crust -- Scotch eggs are great as
appetizers, lunches or dinner!  I took this recipe from my Mom's
collection, but I'm not sure where she got it.

*  Scotch eggs are delicious either hot or cold.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation after eggs are hard-boiled.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
