Title: AYALLA'S BANANA BREAD
Categories: Quick bread, Usenet
Yield: 1 loaf
2 C  Flour
1 t  Baking soda
1 C  Walnuts, chopped
Rum, vanilla, or amaretto
-(optional)
3    Bananas, very ripe
1 C  Sugar
1/2 C  Shortening (butter)
2    Eggs
3 T  Yoghurt or sour cream
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream the shortening and sugar.  Mix in
the bananas.  Mix in the remaining ingredients.  Pour into a greased loaf
pan. Bake 1 hour 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees F.

NOTES:

*  This recipe is from my friend Ayalla -- It makes a heavy, but moist,
loaf of banana bread.

*  If you use more than 3 normal-size bananas, I suggest that you lower the
oven temperature and cook for a while longer.  Otherwise, the crust comes
out almost overcooked while the middle remains moist and almost
undercooked.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  Preparation:  10 minutes; baking:  at least 95 minutes.  Allow
some time for cooling.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
