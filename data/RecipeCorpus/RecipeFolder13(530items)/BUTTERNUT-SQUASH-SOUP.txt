walnuts.

NOTES:

*  Makes a meal with cheese, bread and red wine -- Here is a rich soup
which is easy to make and popular with guests. I like this best with
cheese, bread and red wine as a winter meal, but you can serve it as a
first course.  The original recipe came from _Food & Wine_ magazine a
couple of years ago.

*  As a variation, you may chop some or all of the walnuts in the food
processor or blender while the soup is pureed.  This will give the soup a
slightly different taste and texture.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours cooking.
: Precision:  measure the hot pepper sauce.
