NOTES:

*  Frozen cranberry relish with horseradish -- Susan Stamberg, former
co-host of National Public Radio's "All Things Considered," used to
broadcast this recipe every year around Thanksgiving. She claimed it was
her mother's, but it turned out that her mother got it from a Craig
Claiborne column many years before. Very few people are neutral about this
unusual, rather strong relish, they either love it or hate it. I'm in the
former group.

*  This relish is shocking pink in color, so plan your table setting
accordingly.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight freezing.
: Precision:  measure the horseradish.
