NOTES:

*  Ultimate cheesecake -- This recipe is the original creation of a
co-worker, Don Chaney. I consider myself a cheesecake gourmet, and I rate
this recipe as 8.5 out of 10 (However, there are no 10s). The recipe is so
simple, I almost feel guilty serving it.

*  Variations: Crush some walnuts into the crust.  Pour a can of cherry or
blueberry pie filling over the chilled cake, then chill again.  Put about
2-3 T of your favorite liqueur into the cake filling.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking, overnight cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
