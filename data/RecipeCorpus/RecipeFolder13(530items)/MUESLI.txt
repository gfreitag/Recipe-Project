Title: MUESLI
Categories: Grains, Usenet
Yield: 4 cups
1/2 C  Nuts
3/4 C  Sunflower seeds,
-shelled
1 C  Banana chips
3 C  Rolled oats
1 C  Dried fruit,
-assorted
1 C  Bran
1/4 C  Sesame seeds
Mix all ingredients together.  Serve (about 5 heaped dessert spoons seems
about the right amount) with milk, cream, yoghurt, or whatever you like on
breakfast cereal.  I've heard that fruit juice is an alternative, but I
haven't tried it.

NOTES:

*  The trouble with buying packaged muesli is that it generally contains
salt and sugar, often in larger quantities than you might choose for
yourself. Making your own muesli is quick and easy, and you can change the
ingredients and alter the proportions to suit yourself. After a few
experiments, I've settled on this recipe.

*  Use your own choice of dried fruits.  I like to cut 4 or 5 pieces of
dried apricot into slivers, making up the balance with sultanas or raisins.
I generally use unsalted peanuts, but I'm sure most nuts would be fine (how
about almonds?).  One word of warning:  if you use quick-cooking oats
instead of rolled oats, the result is decidedly mushy.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes.
: Precision:  No need to measure.
