NOTES:

*  Dinner salad made with dandelions and cheese -- The U.S. Department of
Agriculture once had a big presence in the life of the average American.
Their publications on home canning, gardening and cooking found their way
into almost every household in the country.

The USDA Food and Nutrition Service still exists, and they still produce
books and pamphlets on every topic having to do with growing, eating and
analyzing food. In this era of frozen food, microwave ovens and iceberg
lettuce, there's much less demand for their books than there once was.

In time for the Bicentennial, the USDA produced a book called "Favorite
American Recipes," which is a non-copyrighted collection of traditional
American rural and farm recipes.  All are simple and nutritious; most are
also a little dull. Here's one that I like. Yield: serves 4.

*  Make sure that you take the dandelion greens from a lawn that has not
been treated with pesticides or anti-growth hormones recently. (Many lawn
fertilizers also contain weed-control hormones).

*  You can substitute a commercial salad dressing for the oil, vinegar,
pepper and dill.
