Title: VEGETARIAN LASAGNA
Categories: Pasta, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
----------------------------------LASAGNA----------------------------------
-coarsely chopped
8 oz Lasagna noodles
-(1/2 packet)
2    Garlic cloves
1/4 lb Cheese, grated
1 md Onion, chopped
1/2 lb Carrots, grated
1 lb Spinach
5 oz Sweet corn,
-drained (1/2 tin)
1/4 lb Mushrooms,
-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
2 oz Butter
2 1/2 C  Milk
2 oz Cornflour (cornstarch)
Gently fry the carrots and garlic in some butter, set aside.  Gently fry
the onions and mushrooms in some butter, set aside.

Wash the spinach and cook gently in a saucepan without adding any water.
Stir frequently. This really does work and it stops it from going slimy.
Add the corn to this and set aside.

Now make the white sauce.  Melt the butter in a saucepan, take it off the
heat, add the cornflour.  Mix this well.  Slowly add the milk, stirring all
the time.  It is important not to stop stirring, even for a moment. Return
it to the heat and keep stirring until it thickens.

Now build your lasagna.  Take a large square ovenproof dish at least 2
inches deep (we use one about 8 x 12 inches for the quantities given) and
assemble in layers starting with a layer of lasagna, then a layer of sauce,
then one of the previously-prepared vegetable pairs. Repeat the lasagna,
sauce, vegetable pair combination twice more. At this point you should, if
all has gone well, run out of vegetables. Finish off with lasagna and then
sauce.

Top with the cheese and sprinkle on a little paprika if you want.

Bake for about 35 mins at 350 degrees F.

NOTES:

*  A vegetable lasagna with spinach, mushrooms and corn -- This vegetarian
dish can be served on its own or with a side salad.  My thanks to Erica and
Milica who gave me this recipe and who tried different vegetable
combinations until the corn stopped falling out of the sides. Experiment
for yourself, substitute different vegetables according to the season and
your preference. Yield: Serves four to six people.

*  The servings should stay whole as you serve them.

: Difficulty:  easy, but remember to stir the sauce.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 35 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
