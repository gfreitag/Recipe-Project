Title: QUICK AVGOLEMONO SOUP
Categories: Soups, Greek, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1    Lemon, juiced
2 lg Eggs
1 C  White rice, cooked
3 C  Chicken broth
If you don't have any leftover white rice, put about 1 1/2 cup of rice on
to cook.

Heat the chicken broth to boiling.  While the chicken broth is heating,
beat together the lemon juice and eggs in a small bowl or glass measuring
cup until uniform in color.

When the chicken broth is boiling, stir in the cooked rice.  Remove from
heat and stir briskly while slowly pouring the egg mixture into the pot
from about a foot in the air. The soup should end up resembling a cream
soup and there should be no large, visible threads of egg.

NOTES:

*  Greek egg-lemon soup -- This is a perfect way to use up a little
leftover rice.

*  This recipe even works well with canned chicken broth since the lemon
covers up the "canned" flavor.

: Difficulty:  Easy
: Time:  20 minutes if you have to cook the rice, 10 minutes if you don't.
: Precision:  No need to measure.
