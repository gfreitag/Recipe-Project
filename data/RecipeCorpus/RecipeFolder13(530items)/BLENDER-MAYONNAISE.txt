Title: BLENDER MAYONNAISE
Categories: Condiments, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
1 lg Egg
1 C  Oil
1 1/2 t  Lemon juice (juice of
-half a medium lemon,
-up to 2 T)
Place the egg and lemon juice (or vinegar) in a blender.  Blend at a high
speed until the mixture starts to lose some of its yellow color and become
a bit whiter.

Pour the oil in slowly (in a constant stream over the course of about half
a minute). Keep the lid on the blender as you do this (just lift the corner
to pour in the oil),  or else it will spatter everywhere.

NOTES:

*  Many years ago I got tired of store-bought mayonnaise, because for me it
was too sweet and had a rather odd texture.  Learning how to make
mayonnaise turned out to be a challenge, with many failures along the way
(which usually resulted in something on the order of mayonnaise soup). I
find this recipe consistently works well. And surprisingly it, too, has a
rather sweet taste. Yield: 1 cup.

*  As you might guess, the type of oil you use affects the taste of the
mayonnaise.  I suggest that you start with the oil you regularly cook with
and then experiment from there.

*  I've found that the biggest reason for failure is putting in too much
acid (lemon juice/vinegar). The result is something akin to soup. Nothing
will correct this failure. However, you can use this mayonnaise-soup in
potato salad (or other similar salads).

*  You can add small amounts (up to 1 t ) of spices, such as mustard (dried
or prepared) and Tabasco sauce. Add these to the egg/acid mixture before
pouring in the oil, so they get thoroughly mixed into the mayonnaise. This
mayonnaise will normally keep for a maximum of three weeks if kept in a
cold part of the refrigerator (such as the bottom shelf away from the door)
