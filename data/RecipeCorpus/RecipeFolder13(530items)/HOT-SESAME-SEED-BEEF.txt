Title: HOT SESAME SEED BEEF
Categories: Meats, Stir-fry, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
1/2 t  Baking powder
5 t  Sesame oil
5 t  Soy sauce
1 T  Rice wine
1/2 t  Sugar
2 t  Cornstarch
----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
1 1/2 t  Hoisin sauce
1 1/2 t  Oyster sauce
1 T  Sesame seeds
1 1/2 t  Hot bean paste
------------------------------------BEEF------------------------------------
4    Lettuce leaves
-(or less; use
-bok-choy if you
-can get it)
1 t  Minced ginger
2/3 lb Beef tenderloin
-flank
Peanut oil (2-4 T)
Mix together all of the marinade ingredients.  Slice the beef across the
grain into thin, diagonal pieces (about the size of your smallest finger).
Marinate for about half an hour.

Heat the wok until a drop of water dropped into it dances around as it
boils. Add enough oil to coat the wok and saute the ginger. Stir-fry the
lettuce. Stir-fry the beef (in batches so the wok doesn't cool down too
much).

Reduce the heat.  Return the vegetables to the wok.  Add the topping.  Stir
around until everything is mixed and heated evenly.  Serve.

NOTES:

*  Very hot, very simple, very good beef stir-fry -- This recipe has been
floating around for years back east, where it's also known as Hot Flaming
Death.

*  Also add any other vegetables that you feel like.  Sliced carrots or
broccoli are especially nice.

*  Hot bean paste also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc.  This is
the main "spicy" ingredient and should be handled with care. Vary this
ingredient to taste.
