Title: LAMB VINDALOO
Categories: Meats, Indian, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 t  Cinnamon
1/2 t  Cloves
1/2 t  Cayenne
2 t  Mustard seed, ground
1 T  Turmeric
1 C  Wine vinegar
2 md Onions
2 md Potatoes
2 T  Butter
2 lb Lamb, cubed
2 T  Coriander seed
1 T  Cumin seed
2 lb Tomatoes, crushed
14    Garlic cloves, crushed
6    Bay leaves
Ginger (fresh), 2 inches,
-finely chopped
1/2 t  Black pepper, ground
1/2 t  Cardamon seed
Lightly roast the cumin seed and coriander seed by frying with no oil for a
minute or so, stirring constantly.  Grind these and combine them into a
paste with the other spices, the garlic, ginger and the vinegar. Add the
lamb to the marinade and mix well. Refrigerate for 3-24 hours while mixing
every few hours as convenient.

Finely chop the onions and potatoes and saute them for 5 minutes in the
butter.

Add lamb and spice paste and simmer over low heat for half an hour.  The
marinating does add a lot of flavor and makes the meat much more tender.
This can be skipped if need be.

NOTES:

*  A spicy hot Indian lamb dish -- Very loosely based on Dharamjit Singh's
recipe in "Indian Cookery:  A Practical Guide."  Most restaurants that
serve this dish pronounce it vinDAloo, with the stress on the second
syllable.

: Difficulty:  easy (though it's easy to burn the spices while roasting
them).
: Time:  1 hour preparation, 1 day marinating, 1 hour cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
