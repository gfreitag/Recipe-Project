Title: CHICKEN WITH BASIL SAUCE
Categories: Poultry, Australian, Herbs, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
4 lg Chicken fillets
-------------------------------CRUMB TOPPING-------------------------------
3 oz Butter
2    Garlic cloves
2 t  Worcestershire sauce
1/2 t  Mustard, dry
1 C  Bread crumbs, fresh
1/3 C  Parmesan, grated
1 T  Parsley, chopped
1/4 lb Bacon
--------------------------------BASIL SAUCE--------------------------------
1    Egg yolk
1 C  Basil leaves (fresh),
-finely chopped
1/2 C  Oil
1/4 C  White vinegar
1    Garlic clove, crushed
1/2 C  Cream
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Combine bread crumbs, cheese and parsley.
Saute chopped bacon and drain on absorbent paper.  Add the bacon to the
bread crumb mix. This is the crumb topping for the chicken.

In a pan, melt the butter, then add the crushed garlic, Worcestershire
sauce and mustard. Mix and heat through. Coat the chicken fillets with the
butter mixture by dipping them in the saucepan. Arrange in a shallow,
ovenproof dish. Press the bread crumb mixture on top of the chicken pieces
to provide a crumb topping. Bake uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes.

While the chicken cooks, make the basil sauce:  in a saucepan combine all
sauce ingredients except the egg yolk.  Stir until heated and then add the
egg yolk, stirring until thickened. Do not boil. Pour the hot sauce over
the chicken pieces just before serving.

NOTES:

*  Oven-baked chicken pieces with basil sauce -- This recipe came
originally from "The Australian Women's Weekly Dinner Party Cookbook No.
2," available at an Australian news agent near you.

*  The sauce sounds unusual but tastes great.  The fresh basil gives it a
good green colour. Serve with green, vegetables, such as beans and snow
peas, or a leafy green salad for a colour-coordinated dinner.

*  The finer the ingredients in the topping the better will be its effect.
