NOTES:

*  Betty Post's quick fish chowder -- When I left for my first job out of
school, my mother was convinced that I'd starve to death.  She gave me a
set of easy recipes on index cards in hopes that I'd occasionally eat at
home instead of Denny's. This is one of those recipes. It's quick and easy,
and tastes great.

: Difficulty:  Easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 25 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  No need to measure.
