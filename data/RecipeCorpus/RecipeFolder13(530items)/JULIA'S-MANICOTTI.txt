1/4 t  Rosemary
1/4 t  Red pepper flakes

-but dry will do
1 ds Red wine, dry
2 lb Tomatoes, crushed
-(1 large can)
2 lb Tomatoes, whole
-(1 large can)
4 T  Tomato paste
6    Garlic cloves
-(or less)
2 C  Onions, chopped
1/2 C  Olive oil
1/2 t  Black pepper
2    Bay leaves
----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
1/2 C  Parmesan cheese, grated
1/2 C  Romano cheese, grated
1/2 t  Black pepper
1    Garlic clove, crushed
1/2 C  Parsley, chopped
1 lb Ricotta
2    Eggs
1 C  Mozzarella, shredded
MAKE SAUCE:  Saute onions in large pot with olive oil over medium heat. Add
crushed garlic.  Cook until onions start to brown.  Add cans of tomatoes
along with paste, breaking any large chunks. Add in seasonings and red
wine. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20-30 minutes.

MAKE FILLING:  mix filling ingredients in bowl, reserving about 1/2 cup of
the shredded mozzarella to sprinkle on top.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cook manicotti until they are al dente
(follow the instructions on the box). Drain and stuff each with filling
mixture. Cover baking pan with about 1/2 inch of sauce, and arrange stuffed
shells on top. Cover with sauce and reserved mozzarella. Bake at 350
degrees F. for about 20 minutes, until cheese is nicely browned and sauce
is bubbling.

NOTES:

*  This is my (American) recipe for stuffed manicotti shells.  Perhaps it's
not authentic, but it's tasty.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.

*  While I prefer to use true manicotti, regular pasta shells are easier to
stuff and it's okay to substitute.  You can also cut each manicotti down
one side and rewrap it around the stuffing. This freezes well uncooked;
cover with plastic wrap and foil. Let it defrost in a 200 95 oven for an
hour or overnight in the refrigerator. The cheese mixture can be modified
to suit your tastes. Cottage cheese can be substituted for the ricotta.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  1 hour preparation, 20 minutes baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
