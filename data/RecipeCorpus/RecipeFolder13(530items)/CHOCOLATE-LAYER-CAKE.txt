Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine about 1/2 cup sugar with cocoa and
boiling water, and cook over a low heat, stirring constantly, until the
mixture is glossy.  Cool.

Cream the shortening and eggs with the remaining sugar.  Add the cocoa
mixture and the vanilla. Add the dry ingredients and the buttermilk

as it is thicker.
