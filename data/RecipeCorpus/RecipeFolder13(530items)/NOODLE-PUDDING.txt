Title: NOODLE PUDDING
Categories: Puddings, Usenet
Yield: 8 servings
1 t  Lemon juice
1 T  Butter
1/2 t  Vanilla (or to taste)
2    Eggs
1 lb Egg noodles, cooked
-(1 package)
2 C  Sour cream
3 oz Cream cheese
1/2 C  Sugar
Cook the noodles the full time shown on the package for serving.  Our
packages here usually give a time for casseroles and a time for serving.
Drain the noodles, place them in an oven-safe casserole and allow the
butter to melt on them. Stir to mix the butter.

Beat all the remaining ingredients and add to the cooked noodles.  Bake
uncovered at 350 degrees F. for one hour.  The top should be golden brown.

NOTES:

*  A sweet egg noodle kugel -- I usually add more vanilla, but this is the
original recipe I took from my mother.  If you like a soupier noodle
pudding, increase the sour cream and cream cheese.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement ok.
