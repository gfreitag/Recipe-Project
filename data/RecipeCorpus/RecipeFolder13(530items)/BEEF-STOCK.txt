Title: BEEF STOCK
Categories: Soups, Usenet
Yield: 4 quarts
3    Yellow onions, unpeeled
5 qt Water
5 lb Soup bones
1    Bunch carrots
1    Bunch celery
Brown the bones in a heavy pan if there is meat on them.  If there is no
meat, roast the bones in a 400 F oven for two hours, being careful not to
burn them.

Chop the carrots, celery and onions.  The onion skin will add to the color
of the stock.

Place all of the ingredients in a heavy stock pot and simmer for 12 hours.
Add water as necessary to keep the other ingredients covered.  Alternately,
bring to a simmer and place, covered, in a 225 F oven overnight.

Strain the stock.  A layer of fat will form on top of the stock as it
cools. This is a sufficient seal to keep the stock fresh in the
refrigerator for a couple of weeks. It freezes well, too.

NOTES:

*  A basic brown soup stock -- This is a similar stock to the one Jeff
Smith describes in "The Frugal Gourmet." I usually use bones with meat on
them; he recommends meatless ones.
