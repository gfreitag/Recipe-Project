Title: SUGAR COOKIES
Categories: Cookies, Usenet
Yield: 10 dozen
4 C  Flour
1 t  Baking soda
2 t  Cream of tartar
1/2 t  Salt
Extra sugar
-(for dipping)
1 C  Butter, softened
1 C  Salad oil
1 C  Sugar, powdered
-(sifted if it is lumpy)
1 C  Sugar
2    Eggs
1 t  Vanilla
Cream the butter and sugars, then add oil and mix well.  Add the eggs and
vanilla and mix well.

Sift the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt together, then add to
above and mix well.  Refrigerate overnight, or until dough is firm.  If you
want to speed this up, put the dough in the freezer, but keep an eye on it.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Drop dough in 1/2 t amounts on an ungreased
cookie sheet.  Dip a glass in dough and wipe excess off.  Then dip the
glass in sugar and flatten a cookie. Repeat the dip-in-sugar flatten-cookie
sequence until all are done.  The cookies won't spread in baking, so you
can easily judge how far apart to put them (you want room to cook, but not
to grow). If you find that the dough is getting too soft to flatten easily,
put it in the refrigerator between batches.

Bake for about 5-6 minutes, until the edges are JUST beginning to turn
golden brown. Take off the cookie sheet and put on waxed paper or foil to
cool.

NOTES:

*  Delicate and buttery sugar cookies.

*  You can add 2-3 T cocoa to about 1 1/2 cups dough for chocolate cookies,
or add cinnamon to the dipping sugar for spice cookies. I like the sugar
cookies plain, so I've never actually tried this.

*  These cookies don't freeze well, because they pick up the flavors of the
other things in the freezer.  Make only as many as you can eat before they
go stale.
