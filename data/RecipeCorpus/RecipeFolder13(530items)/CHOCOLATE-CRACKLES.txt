NOTES:

*  A traditional Australian sweet snack -- Mention this recipe to an
Australian abroad and he will instantly get homesick.  Yield:  serves 6.

*  Rice Bubbles are called Rice Krispies in North America.  Icing sugar is
confectioner's sugar.  Sultanas are like raisins.  Copha, it would appear,
is utterly unavailable outside Australia. It is a partially-solidified
shortening made of coconut oil.

: Difficulty:  easy if you can get the ingredients.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
