NOTES:

*  An easy quick tummy-warming soup -- One of my favorite cold-weather
soups, this recipe came from a friend of a friend of a friend. The listed
vegetables are really just suggestions. Use whatever suits your fancy, or
is in the refrigerator.

*  Because of the cheese, this soup doesn't survive a night in the
refrigerator very well.
