Title: SOUR CUCUMBER PICKLES
Categories: Pickles, Usenet
Yield: 4 cups
1/8 t  Alum
Cider vinegar
Water
4 C  Cucumbers (small)
4 t  Sugar
2 t  Canning/pickling salt
2 t  Mustard, dry
Wash cucumbers in cool water and pack into a canning jar big enough to hold
them.  Add sugar, salt, dry mustard and alum.  Fill jar about 2/3 full with
vinegar.  Fill remaining portion of jar to cover cucumbers with water.  Put
lid on jar.

Agitate lightly every day for about a week to mix spices in with cucumbers.
Then put in a cool dark place for about 3 months while the cucumbers work.

NOTES:

*  The most lip smackin' pickles you ever tasted, this recipe came from my
wife's grandmother.

*  Don't be too impatient to try the pickles.  They taste terrible if they
haven't worked.  Also, you do not have to seal these jars.  They will keep
for quite some time if stored in a cool/dark location.

: Difficulty:  easy
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 3 months waiting.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
