NOTES:

*  A fruit relish for holiday dinners -- In Chicago, where I did much of my
growing up, there was a company called Indian Trails that made a frozen
cranberry relish, and their relish was traditional at my family's
Thanksgiving dinner. When I moved to Boston I missed it. So I determined
when next I went back to find a package of Indian Trails, read the label
carefully, and duplicate the ingredients.

Alas, the company had gone bankrupt in my absence and there were no
packages anywhere in any reputable store. But I knew about the disreputable
stores as well, so I took myself over to 47th Street and sure enough there
in the frozen foods section I found a pink-marbled, faintly sticky package
of Indian Trails cranberry relish, undoubtedly thawed out and re-frozen at
least a dozen times.

Eagerly I snatched it up, eagerly I read the mysterious ingredients:
cranberries, oranges, sugar.  (This was before the days when they would
have boasted No preservatives! No artificial ingredients!) I returned to
Boston. I tried it: cranberries, oranges, sugar. Based on the original
experience with Indian Trails, I assume my home-made version would freeze
admirably.

One year, in a restless fit, I added a little powdered cinnamon, but that
was silly, and I'm ashamed of myself now.
