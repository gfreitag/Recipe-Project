Title: CRUSTY SCRAPPLE
Categories: Meats, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
1 C  Cornmeal (coarse)
1/2 t  Cayenne
1/2 t  Sage leaves
-(not powdered sage)
1 lb Pork liver
3    Garlic cloves
1/4 lb Butter (1 stick)
3 lb Pork ribs
1 t  Salt
1    Bay leaf
2 t  Thyme leaves
-(not ground thyme)
5    Cloves, whole
2    Yellow onions
Peel and dice one onion.  Simmer pork ribs with salt, bay, thyme, cloves
and onion in the water till the meat falls off the bones. Remove the bones
and gristle, rub the meat into fibers (with your fingers), and reduce this
pork liquor to about 4 cups by further boiling.

Cool 1 cup of the pork liquor and mix it with coarse corn meal and cayenne.
Add the sage, rubbing it between your fingers to crush it as you put it in.

In your Cuisinart, using the steel blade, grind pork liver, the other
onion, and the garlic cloves. Fry the resulting slurry in butter. Add the
cornmeal mixture and the pork-liver mixture to the pork liquor and simmer
the whole thing over a very low flame (or in the top of a double boiler)
for half an hour. Spread thin into two 9-inch square pans to cool. (The
pans needn't be greased.)

To serve, cut and fry squares or fingers with sunny-side-up eggs on the
side.
