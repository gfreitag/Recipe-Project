NOTES:

*  A spicy peanut sauce for chicken, tempeh, or tofu -- My wife and I got
this recipe from the back of a package of Tempeh. We have successfully used
it with chicken chunks also; in fact, we prefer it that way. Yield: Serves
3 or 4.

*  This recipe, if made as suggested, can be very spicy.  We normally cut
the amount of chili powder by half, although that is personal preference.
Experiment with it.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes.
