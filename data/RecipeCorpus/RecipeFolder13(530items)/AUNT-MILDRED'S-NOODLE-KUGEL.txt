Title: AUNT MILDRED'S NOODLE KUGEL
Categories: Desserts, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
1/3 C  Sugar
1 1/2 t  Vanilla extract
12 oz Pineapple, crushed,
-with juice
Cornflake crumbs, to top
1/4 C  Butter
8 oz Noodles, uncooked
3    Eggs, beaten
4 oz Cottage cheese
2 C  Milk
Melt butter in a 9x13 pan.  Add noodles.

Combine remaining ingredients, except crumbs, spread evenly over noodles.
Top with crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees F. for about an hour.

NOTES:

*  Noodle kugel using uncooked noodles -- This recipe is interesting
because you don't cook the noodles first. Yield: Serves 6.

*  This recipe is very simple, but it does taste a little pastier than
recipes that require the noodles to be cooked first.  It also comes out
very flat -- most of the kugel recipes I've made in the past use twice as
many noodles in the same size pan. I found that some of the things can be
increased, i.e., add more noodles, more pineapple, more cottage cheese.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
