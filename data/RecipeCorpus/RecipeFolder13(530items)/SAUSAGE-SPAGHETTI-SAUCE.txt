Title: SAUSAGE SPAGHETTI SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
1 sm Eggplant
1 md Tomato
8 oz Tomato sauce
-(1 standard can)
Salt, pepper, oregano
-to taste
1 lb Italian sausage
2 md Onions
1/2 lb Mushrooms
1 sm Green pepper
-(or use frozen
-diced pepper)
Slice the sausage into bite-size morsels and saute until browned.  Remove
from pan, leaving fat for next step. (While the sausages are browning, you
can cut up the vegetables.)

Slice the onions and the mushrooms.  Cut the peppers into 1/2-inch squares
and dice the tomato. Cut the eggplant into a julienne style.

Add a little oil to the pan and saute the onions, peppers, mushrooms,
eggplant and tomato until the onions are transparent and soft. Add the
tomato sauce and the spices and return the sausage to the pan. Cook about
15 minutes. Serve with fettucine.

NOTES:

*  Spaghetti sauce with sausage, mushrooms and eggplant -- I made up this
recipe the other day to use up some eggplant.  It was an instant hit.
Yield: serves 13.

*  Zucchini can be substituted for the eggplant, and canned tomatoes can be
substituted for the tomato and sauce.  The sauce should be  relatively
thick. The sausage can be hot or mild Italian sausage, but if you use mild
sausage you will need to add more spices.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
