Title: QUICK CHOCOLATE CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Usenet
Yield: 1 cake
--------------------------------CAKE MIXTURE--------------------------------
1/2 t  Bicarbonate of soda
1/4 t  Salt
2    Eggs
1 C  Milk
4 oz Butter (or margarine)
1 1/2 t  Vanilla
1 3/4 C  Flour, self-raising
-(up to 2 C)
1 1/4 C  Caster sugar, or
-white sugar chopped
-in the blender
6 T  Cocoa (Use more if
-you like)
----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
1/2 oz Copha
Nuts
1 C  Cream, whipped with
-a little icing sugar
3 oz Cooking chocolate
Sift the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl.  Soften the butter and
add with the milk and vanilla to dry ingredients. Beat for 2 mins with a
wooden spoon or until smooth. Add eggs and beat another 2 mins. Pour into
an 8-inch round cake tin (I find the collapsible type best). Cook in a
moderate 350-375 degree F. oven for 1 hour.

Turn the cooled cake over, slice into two layers and fill with cream.  Melt
chocolate with copha (do not burn) and pour over cake, dribbling it down
the side. Decorate with almonds, pecans or walnuts.

NOTES:

*  Dangerously delicious chocolate cake.

*  Self-raising flour is popular in Britain and Australia, and hard to find
in North America. Substitute about 2 cups of ordinary flour, all-purpose
with about 1/2 t of salt and about 3 t of baking powder mixed in.

*  The North American equivalent of caster sugar is "granulated sugar."
There is no equivalent of copha, but a mixture of butter and coconut is
better than nothing. Crisco has the right cooking properties to substitute
for copha, but the wrong flavor.

*  You can pour a little Grand Marnier into the cake before spreading the
cream in the middle, but it doesn't need it.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour to cool and 5
minutes decorating. 5 minutes to eat.
: Precision:  Measure the ingredients, though the cocoa and cream are not
critical.
