Meanwhile in a large kettle, mix together the tomato sauce, green chilies
and tomatoes and heat over low heat. When the hamburger is done, mix in
with tomato sauce mixture. Add the spices, salt and sugar, stir well, and
adjust ingredients to taste. It will taste hotter later than it does now.

Simmer for about 1.5 hours, and then add beans and pepperoni.  Simmer for
30 minutes longer. Serve over rice, topped with shredded cheddar cheese.
