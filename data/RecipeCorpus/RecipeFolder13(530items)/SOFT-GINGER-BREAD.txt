Title: SOFT GINGER BREAD
Categories: Breads, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
1 t  Ginger
1 t  Cinnamon
2 3/4 C  White flour
2 lg Eggs
1/4 C  Sugar, powdered
1/4 C  Diluted milk (half
-milk and half water)
1 C  Butter
1 C  Sugar, white
2 t  Baking soda
-(That's SODA, not POWDER)
1 C  Water (boiling)
1 C  Blackstrap molasses
1 t  Salt
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and sugar in a
bowl big enough to hold the entire recipe.

Dissolve the baking soda in about 1 cup boiling water.  Add that mixture
and the molasses, salt, ginger, cinnamon and flour to the butter-sugar
cream. Mix only until moistened and evenly distributed.

Lightly beat the eggs, then add them to the bowl and beat the complete
mixture well. Grease a 9 x 13 shallow baking pan (or a 10-inch round
casserole dish). Pour the mixture into the dish. Bake for about 45 minutes,
or until a poked toothpick comes out clean.

Mix the powdered sugar and the diluted milk together to form an icing, and
brush on to the gingerbread.

Serve warm! You can make a refreshing variation on this basic recipe by
replacing about 1 cup of the flour with whole-wheat flour, reducing the
sugar to about 1/2 cup and increasing the molasses to about 1 1/4 cups.
