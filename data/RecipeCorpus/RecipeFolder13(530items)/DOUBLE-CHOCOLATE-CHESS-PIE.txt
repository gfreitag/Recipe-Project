NOTES:

*  A rich chocolate pie -- I got this recipe from a 1983 calendar.  It's
tried and true and delicious. It's also very simple to make. I usually
double the recipe, since one pie never seems to last long enough. Maybe
that makes it a double double chocolate pie. I've made it using chocolate
almond liqueur instead of creme de cacao. It came out OK, and had a hint of
a nutty flavor in the background.
