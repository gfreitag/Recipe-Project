Title: CHOCOLATE FUDGE
Categories: Candy, Usenet
Yield: 1 batch
2 1/2 t  Butter
1/4 t  Salt
1 T  Corn syrup (light)
1 C  Walnuts (chopped)
1 t  Vanilla extract
1 T  Rum (I use Stroh's
-Inlander rum)
2 C  Sugar (granulated)
1 C  Condensed milk
-(unsweetened!)
2 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
-(I use Hershey's baking
-chocolate; Baker's
-chocolate does NOT work)
Combine sugar, condensed milk, butter, salt, chocolate and corn syrup in a
HEAVY 3-quart saucepan.  Heat slowly.

Stir until everything is melted.  When the chocolate is melted thoroughly,
beat with electric mixer (I ain't proud!) until smooth.

Let cook to halfway between soft and medium ball stage (use candy
thermometer if available). Let cool until barely touchable (due to heat).
Stir in chopped walnuts, vanilla and rum. Beat the mixture until it starts
to set.

When it starts to set, get it into an 8-inch square pan (buttered, of
course). If you wait to do this, you will eat it out of the saucepan.

NOTES:

*  Rich fattening chocolate fudge -- This recipe makes fudge.  Not fudge
brownies, just fudge.  I'm not sure what else to say about it.  Yield:
Makes 1 8-inch pan.

*  This is guaranteed to cause obesity if over-indulged in.

: Difficulty:  Moderate to hard.  Melted chocolate is tricky, and the
timing is fairly important.
: Time:  about an hour.
: Precision:  Measurement important for some ingredients.
