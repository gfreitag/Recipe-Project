Title: THE COUNTESS'S MUSHROOMS
Categories: Entrees, Pasta, Usenet
Yield: 2 servings
2 t  Onion powder
1/2 t  Nutmeg
1/2 t  Tarragon
1/4 t  Curry powder
1/2 t  Black pepper,
-freshly ground
1/4 t  Salt (or to taste)
1 lb Mushrooms, fresh
4 T  Butter
2 T  Flour
2 t  Broth
1 1/2 C  Sour cream
2 T  Lemon juice
1 t  Garlic powder
In a large frying pan, melt the butter.  Saute mushrooms in butter until
tender (about 5 minutes).  Mix flour and chicken base together.  Sprinkle
over mushrooms. Cook one more minute, stirring. Add sour cream, lemon juice
and all seasonings. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more, stirring.

We use chicken broth or chicken bouillon.  If you use a vegetable broth
this is a vegetarian dish.

If you can resist digging in right away, cook this ahead of time to give
the flavors a chance to mellow. At serving time, rewarm carefully over low
heat. This is wonderful as a main dish served over rice, noodles or
fettucini Alfredo.
