Title: ONION SOUP
Categories: Soups, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
2 oz Butter
Salt, pepper
1 1/2 lb Onions
4 C  Beef stock
Peel and slice the onions thinly.  Fry the onions in the butter until
golden brown. This will take about 30 minutes. Add the stock and simmer for
30 minutes. Season and serve.

The amount of onions can be varied down to about half the amount given
above. Onion soup in no way makes me a cannibal.

have. It makes a great starter and is almost trivially easy to prepare.
Yield: Serves 4-6.
