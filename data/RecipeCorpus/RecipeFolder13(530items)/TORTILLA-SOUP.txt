-chopped
Avocado, chopped

12    Corn tortillas
2 C  Tomato sauce
-(2 standard cans)

Cut the tortillas into strips (about 1 inch wide).  Fry the tortillas in
the oil until golden brown and crispy. Dry them in a paper towel and add a
little salt.

To make the soup:  In a medium kettle saute the onions in a bit of oil
until they become translucent. Mix about 2 cups of water with the tomato
sauce and bring to a boil. Set aside. Add salt and pepper to taste.

To serve:  pour the soup into 4 soup bowls.  Put some tortilla strips in
each bowl. Bring them to the table along with the cheese, pork rinds and
avocado. Each person adds the rest to his/her soup to their taste. You can
add some tabasco sauce to the soup to make it hot or use any cheese that
will melt when added to the soup.

NOTES:

*  A soup with crispy tortillas -- This is my recipe for a soup that is
very popular in Mexico. If you have ever wondered what to do with some
leftover tortillas that are in your refrigerator, then read this recipe. If
you haven't wondered, then do it with fresh tortillas.

*  Pork rinds are a typical Mexican snack that is sold in many supermarkets
in bulk or in the snack area.
