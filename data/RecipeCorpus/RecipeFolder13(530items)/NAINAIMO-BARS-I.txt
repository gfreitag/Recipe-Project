NOTES:

*  A Favorite Canadian sweet -- This comes from a page in an obscure
magazine called something like "Canadian Homemaker_, by way of a Canadian
friend, Steve Deering. This is a traditional Canadian sweet, much loved and
admired. The origin of the recipe seems to be lost in the mists of time,
though everyone seems to agree that it comes from the town of Nanaimo, in
British Columbia.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
