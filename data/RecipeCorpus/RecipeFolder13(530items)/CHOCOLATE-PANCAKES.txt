Title: CHOCOLATE PANCAKES
Categories: Desserts, Usenet
Yield: 3 dozen
2 t  Vanilla
1/2 t  Salt
1/2 C  Butter cream
-frosting
3/4 C  Margarine
3/4 C  Cocoa
2 C  Flour
1 1/2 C  Sugar
4    Eggs
Melt the margarine and mix with the cocoa.

In a small bowl, mix flour and salt.

In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs.  Then add sugar, vanilla, and beat well.
Add flour and margarine mixture to this and blend thoroughly.

Heat skillet to medium-low.  Drop small clumps (about 1 T) and cook like
pancakes:  about 1 1/2 minutes on one side, 1/2 minute on the other, then
turn over again and remove after a few seconds. Freeze. When relatively
hard, coat one side with buttercream frosting.

NOTES:

*  Brownies in a skillet -- This recipe is based on a "chocolate turtle"
recipe by Mae Rabenius from a cookbook produced by Faith United Methodist
Church in Phoenix, Arizona.  Yield:  40 pieces.

*  One side of the pancakes may burn.  It doesn't particularly affect the
taste, and if you frost this side, no one will even know.

*  It's not necessary to cook the pancakes completely; if the middle looks
somewhat gooey, don't fret:  it will soon harden.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes to cook, 10 minutes to frost.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
