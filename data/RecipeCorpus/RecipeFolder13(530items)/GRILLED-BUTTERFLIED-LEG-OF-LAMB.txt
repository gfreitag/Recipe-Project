Categories: Meats, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
2 t  Rosemary
1/2 t  Black pepper,
-ground coarse
1/2 t  Marjoram
1/2 t  Oregano
1/2 t  Savory
4 lb Leg of lamb,
-butterflied (approx)
2 t  Salt
2    Garlic cloves, chopped
1 C  Olive oil

1/3 C  Tomato paste
Have the butcher butterfly the leg of lamb, or do it yourself.

Combine all remaining ingredients in a glass, enamel, stainless, or plastic
container and beat with a whisk or fork until combined.  It takes a few
minutes.

Add the lamb, turning it to make sure it is coated on all sides.  Marinate
two hours at room temperature, or overnight in the refrigerator. Check
occasionally to make sure that it is still coated with the marinade and
re-cover as necessary.

Grill outside, or broil inside at about 8 inches from the flame for 15
minutes on each side, brushing occasionally with the marinade. Serve sliced
thin (hot) with the rest of the marinade, heated.

NOTES:

*  Leg of Lamb with Rosemary & Tomato Baste -- My wife and I have used this
recipe a number of times, and have found that the marinade, in and of
itself, is excellent for any type of lamb. Yield: Serves 6-8.

*  This also makes wonderful sandwiches if there are any leftovers.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  several hours marinating, 30 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
