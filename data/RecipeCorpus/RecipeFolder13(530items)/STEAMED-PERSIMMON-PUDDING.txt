Title: STEAMED PERSIMMON PUDDING
Categories: Puddings, Holiday, Usenet
Yield: 6 servings
1 C  Sugar
1 1/2 t  Baking soda
1 t  Salt
1/2 t  Cinnamon
1 C  Raisins, golden
1/2 C  Walnuts, chopped
1 C  Persimmon pulp,
-pureed (about 2
-large persimmons)
1/2 C  Milk
2 T  Butter, melted
2 t  Vanilla extract
2 C  Flour, all-purpose
Blend together the persimmon pulp, milk, butter and vanilla.  Sift flour,
measure, and sift again with sugar, soda, salt and cinnamon.

Combine the liquid ingredients with the dry ingredients, and stir in the
raisins and nuts.  Pour into a well-buttered 6-cup mold.  Cover tightly
with a buttered lid.

Place the mold in a deep pan, using a rack or inverted perforated foil pan
to keep the mold out of the water. Pour boiling water into the deep pan
just up to, but not touching, the mold.

Cover tightly and keep the water simmering; add boiling water as necessary.
Steam the pudding for 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours, depending upon the size
and shape of the mold.  The pudding is done when a toothpick comes out
clean.

Cool about 10 minutes before unmolding.  Serve warm, with hard sauce.
