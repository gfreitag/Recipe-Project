Yield: 4 servings
1/4 t  Black pepper
2 T  Tarragon (fresh),

2 T  Chervil (fresh),
-minced
2 T  Lemon basil, minced
3    Melons, in three

Cut melons of three different colors into melon balls and drain the balls
in a colander. Save the juice to make sherbet.

Make a very strong salad dressing of chicken broth, sherry vinegar, lemon

lemon basil.

Dress the drained melon balls and let the dressing sink in for half an
hour. Serve with sliced ham and toast.

NOTES:

*  Margaret's X-rated melon balls -- I had a lettuce and tomato sandwich
Saturday with mustard instead of mayonnaise.  Better than I would have
feared. But the big discovery of the week is Margaret's X-rated melon
balls. Yield: Serves 4.

*  In truth, I have to report that Margaret herself thought the garlic was
too much; but I didn't.

*  This recipe is not wholly unrelated to fruit curry, another godsend for
the overplump.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes waiting.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
