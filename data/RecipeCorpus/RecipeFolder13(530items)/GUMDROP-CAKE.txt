Title: GUMDROP CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Usenet
Yield: 2 loaves
8 oz Gumdrops (no black
-ones; 2 standard bags)
1/4 t  Nutmeg
12 oz Coconut, shredded
-(1 standard bag)
1 C  Butter
Walnuts, to taste
2 C  Sugar
4 C  Flour
2    Eggs
1 t  Baking soda
1 1/2 C  Applesauce
1/4 t  Salt
1 t  Vanilla
1 t  Cinnamon
1 lb Raisins, white
1/4 t  Cloves, ground
Cream together butter, sugar and eggs in one bowl.  In another bowl, mix
the dry ingredients together (flour, salt, soda and seasonings). Add the
flour mixture to the butter mixture half at a time, alternating it with the
applesauce.  Pick all the black gumdrops out and eat them or throw them
away. Add the nuts, raisins, coconut and remaining gumdrops; blend well.

Line 2 large loaf pans or 5 small loaf pans with wax paper! (Grease won't
work).  Fill pans about 2/3 full.  Bake at 300 degrees F. for about 2
hours. Let cool for about 15 minutes before you try to remove the loaves
from the pan. They should just fall right out when turned upside down, then
peel off the wax paper.

NOTES:

*  Cake with gumdrops, applesauce, raisins and coconut.

: Difficulty:  easy, though creaming butter and sugar without a food
processor is tedious.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 2 hours baking, 15 minutes cooling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

The smaller gumdrops work best when you go to cut the cake.  I can never
find small gumdrops that are not 'spice drops', so I buy the large ones and
cut them into quarters. The cake also slices a lot better when almost
entirely cool. If you try to cut a piece while it's still hot, it'll taste
GREAT, but it will crumble all over.
