Title: BRAN MUFFINS
Categories: Muffins, Usenet
Yield: 12 muffins
3/4 C  Whole wheat flour
3/4 C  Rice flour
1/3 C  Oatmeal, uncooked
1 C  Nuts, chopped
3/4 C  Raisins
3/4 C  Dates, chopped
1    Egg
1 3/4 C  Cream
3/4 C  Vegetable oil
1 C  Wheat bran
1 T  Baking powder
1 t  Salt
1 C  Dark molasses
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease the bottoms of your muffin pan.
Chop the nuts and dates.

Beat the egg, then add to it cream and oil.  Mix this together well, then
mix in the bran and let it sit there and absorb liquid for about five
minutes.

In another large bowl measure and slightly blend the wheat and rice flour
and the oatmeal.

Now that it's been about five minutes, add the baking powder, salt and
molasses to the soaking bran and mix thoroughly.

Dump the bran mixture into the flour mixture and blend a bit, then fold in
the nuts, raisins and dates. Try not to mix too much because over-mixing
can degrade the texture of the muffins.

Fill muffin tins about to the top and bake at 350 degrees F. for about 25
minutes.  You can use milk instead of cream, but the muffins will not be as
rich and moist.

NOTES:

*  Very rich and moist muffins with bran, raisins, nuts and dates -- I
experimented a lot to find the ultimate bran muffin recipe.  I started with
a recipe from the "Betty Crocker Cookbook," but I've changed it enough that
I'm willing to take all the credit for it. Yield: 12 large muffins.

*  Using 1/3 hazelnuts and 2/3 walnuts adds a distinctive flavor.

*  I like to let the batter sit in the refrigerator for a while (a few
hours to overnight) before I bake it.
