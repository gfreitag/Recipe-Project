Title: CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES
Categories: Candy, Usenet
Yield: 2 dozen
1/2 C  Whipping cream
1/4 C  Butter, unsalted
1 C  Sugar
3/4 C  Chocolate, powdered
Put all ingredients in a solid sauce-pan, mix while bringing slowly to the
boil.  Boil gently.  After two minutes you will have a wonderful icing for
cakes, and a sauce for ice cream.

After six minutes (or a little longer if you want your truffles harder)
take sauce-pan off heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly. At this
point you can add dark rum or any other liqueur if you wish. Cool in the
refrigerator for about one hour.

Form into balls about the size of large marbles and roll them in powdered
chocolate.  Cool to room temperature, or chill.

NOTES:

*  Very simple chocolate truffles -- I found this recipe in the flight
magazine for a trip from London to Vienna.  I think Vienna is probably the
best place in the world for cakes and sweets.  Whatever you do, never go to
Vienna if you are on a diet.  This is also the only recipe I have ever
collected that is in cups rather than grams!  Yield:  Makes 25-30.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooling, 1 hour forming balls.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
