Title: LOUBIA BIL LUZ
Categories: Entrees, Algerian, Vegetables, Usenet
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 t  Ground cumin
1/4 t  Paprika
1/4 t  Ground cloves
1 T  Almonds, slivered
1 lb Green beans, fresh
4 C  Water, salted
3 T  Peanut oil
1    Garlic clove, mashed
Clean and trim green beans.  Simmer in lightly salted water until just
tender, about 30-45 minutes. Drain and put in serving dish.

Put remaining ingredients (except almonds) in a saucepan over medium heat
and cook for two minutes, stirring constantly. Add the almonds and stir
briefly to coat. Pour the oil mixture over the green beans and toss gently
until beans are thoroughly coated. Serve warm.

NOTES:

*  Algerian green beans with almonds -- This is a variation on an Algerian
recipe from Rose Dosti's "Middle Eastern Cooking."  Since when is North
Africa in the Middle East? You may well ask.

*  Canned green beans are not an acceptable substitute in this recipe.
Powdered garlic is probably OK.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 50 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
