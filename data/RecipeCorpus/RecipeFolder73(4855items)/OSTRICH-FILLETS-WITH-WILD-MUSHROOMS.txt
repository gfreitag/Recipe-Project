(portabello, shitake)
6    Ostrich fillets
1/2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
1/2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Minced shallots
2 lg Garlic cloves

Slice 1/2 lb portobello, shiitake, or other "wild mushrooms. In a
skillet over medium- high heat, melt 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter
with 1/2 tablespoon olive or canola oil. Add mushrooms and brown
lightly. Add 2 tablespoons minced shallots and 2 large garlic cloves,
finely minced; cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Season with coarse sea
salt, freshly ground black pepper, and dash cayenne pepper. Set
aside. Select a heavy skillet large enough to hold 6 ostrich fillets
without touching and place over medium-high to high heat. Add 1/2
tablespoon unsalted butter and 1 tablespoon olive or canola oil. When
foam subsides, add fillets and saute quickly, turning once, until
nicely browned on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Sprinkle
with coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper as you turn
fillets and be careful not to overcook. Test as directed and transfer
fillets to a heated platter. Pour off any fat in skillet and return
to high heat. Add 1/2 cup beef stock and 1/2 tablespoon tomato paste.
Cook, stirring up any browned bits on skillet bottom, until liquid is
reduced to about 3 table-spoons. Add 1/3 cup dry red wine or Madeira
and boil 2 minutes. Add reserved mushrooms to skillet, heat briefly,
and pour over fillets. Sprinkle with minced fresh parsley and serve
immediately.
