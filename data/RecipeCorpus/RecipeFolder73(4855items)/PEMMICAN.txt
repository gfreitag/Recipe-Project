Title: PEMMICAN
Categories: Game, Caribou, Dried, Jw
Yield: 1 Batch
1 lb Caribou Jerky
2 tb Brown sugar
2 oz Raisins
2 oz Cranberries
5 oz Suet
Run the dry jerky through a food grinder a few times. In a loaf pan
add the cranberries, raisins and brown sugar. When the mixture is
well blended, melt the suet and stir it in. Let the suet cool and
harden. This approximates the old style pemmican made to preserve
meat without refrigeration and to add some vitamin C values.
