NOTES:

*  A rich dill, paprika and mushroom soup -- I first saw this at "Old
Wives Tale," a restaurant in Portland, Oregon. The waiter there said
that this had been on the menu every day for a year, and highly
recommended it. The soup was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised to
find a recipe for it in Molly Katzen's "Moosewood Cookbook." Yield:
Serves 3-4.

*  Tamari is a kind of soy sauce; if you can't find it, you can use
ordinary soy sauce.
