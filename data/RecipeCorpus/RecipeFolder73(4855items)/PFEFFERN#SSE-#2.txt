Title: PFEFFERN#SSE #2
Categories: Cookies, German
Yield: 42 Cookies
2 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Cloves
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Ginger
1/4 ts Cardamom
1/4 ts Pepper, black
1/4 ts Baking soda
2    Egg
1 c  Brown sugar, dark
1/3 c  Walnuts; finely chopped
3 c  Sugar
ds Cream of tartar
1 c  ;Water
2    Egg white
Sift flour with spices and soda. Set aside.  In large bowl, using an
electric beater at high speed, beat eggs and brown sugar until light
(about five minutes). At low speed, beat in flour mixture and nuts.
Mix until well-combined.  Dough will be *sticky*.  With wet hands,
pinch dough by tablespoonsful and roll into 1-inch balls. Place on
lightly greased cookie sheets and bake at 375 degrees for 12 to 15
minutes. Cool on wire rack.

While the cookies are cooling, combine sugar with cream of tartar and
water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring
until sugar dissolves. Boil without stirring for five minutes or
until sugar forms a two-inch thread when dropped from the spoon (235
degrees on the candy thermometer).

Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, with mixer at medium speed, beat egg
whites until stiff peaks form. Pour syrup into egg whites in a
continuous stream, beating constantly. Beat together until mixture is
slightly thickened.

Drop the cooled cookies, a few at a time, into the glaze. With a
fork, turn to coat completely. Lift out and place on a wire rack to
dry or, preferably, roll in a shallow bowl of sifted confectioners'
sugar for a final dusting of crunchy, snowlike frosting.  Store in a
tighly covered container at least a week before using.
