Yield: 1 Servings  :

With a 1-inch melon-ball cutter scoop out enough balls from the flesh
of a pumpkin to measure 2 cups. In an enameled or stainless steel
saucepan combine 1 2/3 cups sugar, 3/4 cup cider vinegar, 1/2 cup
water, 1 cinnamon stick, broken into pieces, 6 cloves, 6 whole
allspice, and four 2-inch strips of lemon peel, bring the liquid to a
boil over moderate heat, stirring and washing down any sugar crystals
clinging to the sides of the pan with a brush dipped in cold water
until the sugar is dissolved, and cook syrup, undisturbed, for 5
minutes. Add the pumpkin balls, simmer the mixture for 15 minutes,
and transfer the balls with a slotted spoon to a 1-pint jar. Reduce
the syrup over high heat to 1 cup, pour it and the spices over the
balls, and let the mixture cool. Chill the mixture, covered, for at
least 3 hours. Transfer the pickles to a small serving bowl. Keep
covered and chilled, for 1 week
