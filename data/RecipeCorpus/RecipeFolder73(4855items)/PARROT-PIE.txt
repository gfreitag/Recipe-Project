* Parakeets are a small, long-tailed tropical parrot.

small bird. Line a pie-dish with the beef, over it place 6 of the
paraquets, intersperse slices of egg, parsley and lemon-rind, dredge
lightly with flour, and season with salt and pepper. Cover with the
bacon cut into strips, lay the rest of the birds on the top,
intersperse slices of egg, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle
with parsley and lemon-rind as before; three-quarter fill the dish
with cold water, cover with puff-paste, and bake in a quick oven.

Time: About 2-1/2 hours. SUFFICIENT for about 12 persons.
