~------------------------------------------------------
~------------- ~-- Wash shrimp and slit down the back so they will be
easy to peel. You may peel before cooking, but traditionally the
shrimp are cooked in the barbecue sauce in the shell.  Combine
remaining ingredients in a saucepan; simmer for 10 minutes. Pour over
shrimp and mix thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate at least 2-3 hours,
stirring occasionally. Heat oven to 300Ã¸F. Place shrimp and sauce in
a shallow pan or black iron skillet. Bake shrimp, turning frequently
until they just turn pink, about 15-20 minutes. Do not over bake.
Shrimp should be tender. From: Syd's Cookbook.
