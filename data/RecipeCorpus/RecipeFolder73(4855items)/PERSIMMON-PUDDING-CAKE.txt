Stir together sugar and corn oil.  Sift together the flour, salt,
cinnamon and nutmeg; add to the sugar and oil. (The batter will be
stiff and crumbly so far.) Dissolve the baking soda in the warm water
and add to the batter.

Mix the persimmons, brandy and vanilla together in a separate bowl
then add to the batter.  Add the egg substitute, mixing thoroughly
but lightly. Add the raisins and nuts; stir until mixed.

Pour batter into a loaf pan lined with foil and sprayed with nonstick
vegetable coating.  Bake in a pre-heated 350-degree oven for about 45
minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Pull the pudding cake out of the pan by the foil and cool.

Serve each slice with 1 tablespoon topping, if desired.

Makes 16 slices.

TOPPING: Blend all ingredients in a food processor with a metal blade
until satin smooth.

Refrigerate in a tightly covered container.

Makes 1 cup.
