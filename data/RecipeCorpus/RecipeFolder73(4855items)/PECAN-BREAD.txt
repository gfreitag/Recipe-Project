Title: PECAN BREAD
Categories: Breadmaker
Yield: 1 Servings
-PHILLIP BOWER   (FHMN87A)
1 pk Yeast
3 1/4 c  Whole wheat flour
1 1/2 c  Milk
1 ts Salt
1 tb Corn oil
1 c  Toasted chopped pecans
Place ingredients in breadmaker. Process on white bread cycle. Any
nut can be substituted for pecans.
They don't really need to be chopped before placing in the
breadmaker. Sometimes I need to add extra flour to this recipe. As
always oat flour is a fine preservative and your bread will keep
longer.
