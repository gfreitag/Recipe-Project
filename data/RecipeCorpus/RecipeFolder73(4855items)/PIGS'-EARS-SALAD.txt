It is important that all ingredients in this recipe be well chilled.

Prepare pigs' ears according to Steps I and II in the basic
instructions. Discard water and return ears to pot with water to
cover, star anise and ginger.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover
and simmer for 45 minutes, or until ears are tender.  Remove ears,
let cool and chill. Cut into thin strips (1/8 inch).

Combine pigs' ears, carrots, cucumbers and onions and toss lightly
with plum sauce.  Season with salt and pepper and a little fresh
lemon juice if a slightly tart flavor is desired. Serve on crisp
lettuce and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Serves 6.

well...  S.C.]
