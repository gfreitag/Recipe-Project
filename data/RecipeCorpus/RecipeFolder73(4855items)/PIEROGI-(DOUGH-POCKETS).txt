4 c  Flour
4 md Eggs
1 ts Salt
1 c  Water
Pierogi (Dough Pockets) Oil

Place flour in a bowl or on a kneading board.  Mix eggs, salt and
water, beating slightly.  Add mixture to flour and knead until the
dough is firm. Divide dough in half or quarters and cover with warm
bowl or towel and let dough rest for 10 to 20 minutes.

Take a piece of dough and roll it out thin on a floured board. Cut
circles (approximately 5 inches in diameter) with a cookie or biscuit
cutter. Place small amout of desired filling in the center of dough,
fold in half, firmly pressing edges together.  Repeat until all dough
and filling has been used.

Fill large pot with water (approximately 3 inches from the top), add a
pinch of salt and about 2 ounces of oil. Bring water to a boil and,
while keeping water boiling, gently place pierogi in boiling water.
Pierogi will rise to the top.  Cook about 5 minutes. Remove gently
with a skimmer or slotted spoon and place in a flat roasting pan
containing about 1 inch of oil.

Allow to cool, remove and place on a cookie sheet or platter till
cold.

Note: Add water to pot as needed.  If water should get starchy
(milky), discard and start over with a pot of fresh water.

When pierogi is cold, place in a  plastic bag and store in
refrigerator or freezer until ready to use. Do not stack or pack
tightly.

When heating pieogi, use large frying pan and saute (with butter,
salt pork or bacon in combination with onions or mushrooms) until
heated through. Serves 8 to 12. Serve with sour cream.
