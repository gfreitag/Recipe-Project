PREPARATION:  Make the Egg Pasta dough; roll as thin as possible. For
farfalle, cut dough into 1-inch wide strips; then cut each strip into
2 inch long pieces. Pinch each piece to form a bow-tie. OR cut dough
into 1/8-inch wide strips for linguine.

For The Pesto, grate the cheese.  Mash the garlic with the salt to
form a smooth paste.  Combine the garlic paste, basil, pine nuts, and
olive oil in food processor or blender. Puree until smooth. Stir in
the cheese. NOTE: Can be made to this point several hours ahead.

COOKING AND SERVING:  Heat the grill or broiler.  Toss the chicken
with vegetable oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil or grill
the chicken, turning once, until just cooked through, about 10
minutes total. Cut into bite-size pieces. Cook pasta in boiling,
salted water until tender, about 3 minutes for fresh pasta. Drain and
return to pot. Toss with chicken and pesto sauce and season with salt
and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Makes 4 servings.
