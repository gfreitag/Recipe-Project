Scatter pine nuts in a pie plate nd bake in a 350 degree oven until
golden, 4-6 minutes. Pour toasted nuts into a food processor along

pepper; whirl until finely chopped. Slowly add the butter and pulse

visible. Shuck oysters and discard top shells. Nestle oysters, in
their bottom shells, in a 1/2 inch layer of rock salt in a baking pan
or shallow oven-proof dish. Spoon about 1 teaspoon butter on top of
each oyster (freeze leftover butter) Bake oysters in a 375 degree
oven until they become firm and butter melts, 8-10 minutes.
