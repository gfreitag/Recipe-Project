Categories: Desserts, Pies, Fruits, Soup/stews
Yield: 8 Servings
Pate Sucree (separate
-recipe), chilled
3 tb Almond paste (about 3 oz)
1 tb All-purpose flour
1 1/4 lb Santa Rosa plums (4 or 5),
-pitted and sliced into
-1/4-inch-thick wedges
2 ts Sugar
1 lg Egg yolk beaten with 1 T
Heavy cream, for egg wash
1/4 c  Plum or red-currant jam
1. Heat oven to 375'. Set a 4 1/2-by-14-inch bottomless tart form on a
parchment-lined baking sheet. Roll out pastry to 1/8 inch thick, it
should be about 3 inches longer and wider than tart form. Roll pastry
onto pin and unroll over form; let extra dough hand over the edge.
Fit dough into form.

2. Crumble almond paste evenly over pastry and sprinkle flour evenly
on top. Neatly overlap sliced plums in a fish-scale pattern on top of
flour and sprinkle with sugar. Fold sides of pastry over plums and
tear to create a 1-inch free-form edge. Chill for 10 to 15 minutes.
Brush pastry with egg wash. Bake until crust is golden brown and
fruit is bubbling, about 35 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, heat jam and 2 T water in a small saucepan over medium
heat. Remove from heat and strain if necessary, discarding fruit
solids. Brush warm glaze over fruit. Cool slightly, remove tart form,
and serve.
