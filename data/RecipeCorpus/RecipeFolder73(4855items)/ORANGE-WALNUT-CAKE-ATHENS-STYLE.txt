Title: ORANGE WALNUT CAKE ATHENS STYLE
Categories: Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 10 Servings
1/2 lb Butter; sweet
2 c  Granulated sugar
4    Eggs
1    Orange,(juice & grated rind)
3 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Walnuts; coarsely chopped
Confectioners' sugar (opt.)
Cream the butter until light and fluffy, then gradually add the sugar.
Continuing to beat, add the eggs one at a time, beating well, on
medium speed, after each addition. Gradually add the orange juice and
rind. Meanwhile, sift the flour with the baking powder and salt and
gradually add to the batter.  Add the walnuts last, blend another
minute on medium high speed, and pour into a greased and lightly
floured 8-inch tube pan. Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 25 to 30
minutes until the color is a light chestnut and the cake springs back
to the touch. (Watch carefully because this cake bakes quickly.) Turn
onto a wire rack, round side up. Dust with confectioners' sugar and
cool thoroughly before slicing.
