Wash the sorrel and dry it well, by hand or in a salad spinner.
Chop the sorrel coarsely, and again squeeze away any liquid.
Blend the sorrel, shallots, pine nuts, parsley, chives, orange peel
and onion in a food processor or blender. (If using a blender, make
sure these ingredients are already finely chopped.)
Add dry mustard, salt, pepper and cayenne, and mix again. SLOWLY
drizzle in the oil while the blade is moving. Transfer to tempered
glass jars and store in refrigerator (for up to 8 to 10 weeks) or in
the freezer for up to a year.
NOTES:  Sorrel's peak season is summer, although you can find
hothouse sorrel year round in some stores. You may reduce the amount
of orange peel by 1/4 or 1/2 if you'd like to emphasize the sorrel or
other flavors. Walnuts or almonds may be substituted for the pine
nuts.
