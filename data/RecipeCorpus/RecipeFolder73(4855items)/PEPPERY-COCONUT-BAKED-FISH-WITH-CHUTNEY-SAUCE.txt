Categories: Fish, Jaw, Main dish
Yield: 8 Servings
3 tb Oil
1/2 c  Butter, melted
3 tb Orange juice
2 tb Lemon juice
2 ts Garlic powder
2 ts Ginger
2 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
1 c  Plain bread crumbs
1 1/2 c  Unsweetened coconut
8    6 oz fish fillets (red
Snapper, bass, turbot, or
Orange roughy)
MMMMM-------------------------FOR SAUCE------------------------------
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
1/4 c  Chutney (like mango)
1 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Curry powder
Heat over to 425 degrees and pour oil into 13x9 baking pan (or spray
with Pam); tilt pan to coat evenly. In shallow bowl, mix butter,
orange juice, lemon juice, garlic powder, ginger, red pepper flakes.
Salt and pepper if desired. In shallow bowl, combine coconut and
bread crumbs. Dip fish in butter mixture and coat with bread crumb
mixture. Bake at 425 for 5 minutes. Turn fillets over; sprinkle with
remaining mixture. Bake an additional 10-15 minutes or until fish is
golden brown and flakes easily. Mix all sauce ingredients. Serve
sauce over fish, garnish with lemon and parsley.

Variation: 1-1/2 lbs of peeled, deveined, butterflied shrimp can be
substituted. Combine the butter, orange juice, lemon juice, garlic
powder, ginger and pepper flakes in a bowl. Add 1 tsp of coconut
extract if you don't have coconut. Put the butterflied shrimp in the
butter mixture and transfer to plain bread crumbs and toss to coat.
Turn shrimp into a "Pam" sprayed pan, separating the ones that
"hunked" together, then into the 425 oven for 5 minutes...flip with a
spatula and another 10 minutes in the oven. If you don't have
chutney, add extra lemon juice...it turns out fine.
