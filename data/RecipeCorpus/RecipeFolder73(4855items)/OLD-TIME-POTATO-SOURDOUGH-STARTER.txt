Title: OLD-TIME POTATO SOURDOUGH STARTER
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Flour, unbleached
2 tb Salt
2 tb Sugar
4 c  Potato water; lukewarm
Put all ingredients in a crock or large jar and let stand in a warm
place uncovered several days.

This is the author's last choice for making a starter, but seems to
be in all the cookbooks dealing with Sourdough Starters. Use only as
a last resort.

NOTE:

All containers for starters not using yeast, must be carefully scalded
before use.  If you are careless or do not scald them the starter will
fail.
