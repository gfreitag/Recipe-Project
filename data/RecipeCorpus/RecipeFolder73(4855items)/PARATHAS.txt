Title: PARATHAS
Categories: Breads, Spicy
Yield: 6 Servings
8 c  Whole Wheat Flour
3 ts Salt
2 c  Water, About
1/3 c  Butter
Yield:  12 To 16 Parathas Cooking Time: 2 To 3 Minutes Each

Sift the flour and salt and gradually add the water, soothing out any
lumps, and making a pliable dough. Knead the dough well. Then cover
it with a damp cloth and allow to stand for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Make
small balls out of the dough.  Roll them out, thin and even. Then
with the back of a tablespoon, rub each pancake with melted butter.
Fold once and rub with more butter. Repeat once, better still twice.
Then roll them out again in triangle shapes.  Heat the griddle and
butter it slightly. Cook parathas on both sides, turning once. When
finished, the bread is of a mild honey color and crisp.  To make them
crisper, substitute some of the water with about 4 Tbls of milk.
