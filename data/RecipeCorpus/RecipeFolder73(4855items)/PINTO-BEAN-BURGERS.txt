Title: PINTO BEAN BURGERS
Categories: Main dish, Grill, Vegetarian, Mark's
Yield: 20 Burgers
2 c  Pinto beans, soaked
4 ea Dried red chiles
4 ea Garlic cloves, halved
4 c  Water
1/2 ts Sage
2 tb Parsley
1/2 ts Hungarian paprika
Salt & pepper
Flour, as needed
Oil, for brushing
Rinse soaked beans.  Cover with water, add the chiles & garlic cloves,
bring to a boil & simmer for 1 hour or until very soft. When cooked,
drain well & mash with a potato masher (Note: I have tried running
these through a processor, but their consistency is much softer). Do
not remove the chiles or garlic unless you really do not want the
extra taste. Preheat the oven to 350F.

Add the remaining ingredients & mix very well.  Add enough flour to
ensure that the patties will hold together. Divide mixture into 20
equal portions & shape into a ball. Flatten each ball into a pattie &
place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet.  Brush each pattie with a
little vegetable oil & bake for 10 minutes. Flip the patties, brush
with oil & bake for another 10 minutes.  The baking helps them hold
together better. Cool on wire racks.

To serve, fry or grill as you would any burger & serve with all the
fixings.  They also freeze reasonably well.
