Select bunches of firm, ripe grapes.  Wash.  Do not remove stems.
Pack in sterilized jars.  Care must be used to avoid crushing the
grapes. Make a sirup, using 3 cups sugar to 2 cups vinegar. Boil
mixture 5 minutes. Pour hot sirup over grapes.  Seal. These grapes,
if stored in a dark place, will retain their color. They may be used
for garnishing. The Household Searchlight
