Season the veal chops with the salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a
large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add the veal chops, and brown 3
to 4 minutes on each side, until nicely browned. Remove from the pan.
In the same pan, saute the onions in the pan juices 3 to 4 minutes,
or until the mushrooms begin to wilt. Add the white wine and reduce
until the wine evaporates. Add the veal stock, sage, and Prosciutto,
and bring to a boil. Return the veal chops to the pan and cover,
leaving the lid slightly ajar. Reduce the heat to low and cook an
additional 10 minutes. Serve the chops on individual plates, with
some of the sauce spooned over each, and accompanied by Roasted
Garlic and Roasted Tomato and Goat Cheese Salad.
