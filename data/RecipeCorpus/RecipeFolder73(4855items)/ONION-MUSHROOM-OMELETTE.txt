Categories: Breakfast, Cheese/eggs, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ts Margarine
1 sm Onion, thinly sliced
2 ts Sugar
1 c  Mushrooms, sliced
1 tb Balsamic vinegar
3    Egg whites
1 tb Milk, nonfat
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Black pepper, ground
1 tb Parsley, fresh - chopped
Prep time: 15 mins. Cook time: 15 mins.

In large nonstick fry pan over medium heat, melt the margarine. Saute
onion with sugar until tender and golden brown, about 4 mins. Add the
mushrooms and vinegar and cook till mushrooms are tender, 3 mins.
Transfer the onion and mushroom mix to a small bowl. In a large bowl,
combine the egg whites, milk, salt and pepper. Beat egg-white mixture
until stiff peaks form. Wipe out nonstick fry pan and coat with
nonstick cooking spray. Place over medium heat. Add the egg-white mix
and gently level using back of spoon. Spread onion-mushroom mix over
half of the eggs. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and cook till eggs
are cooked, 4-5 mins. Using a spatula, carefully loosen the underside
of omelette. Fold in half, cover and cook for 1 minute more. Garnish
with parsley and serve immediately.

Serving tips: If preparing several omelettes, keep the first ones
warm, covered with foil, in a 250 F (120 C) oven until all are ready
to be served.

Additional notes: All the fat and cholesterol in eggs reside in the
yolks, while the egg whites are rich in protein and albumin. For
healthier cooking of any recipe with eggs, substitute 2 egg whites
for each whole egg.
