6    Rock Cornish Hens; cleaned
Salt
Garlic powder
Ground ginger
Flour; for dusting
MMMMM-----------------PEACH AND RAISIN STUFFING----------------------
2    Apples, peeled, cored and
-coarsely chopped
1 c  Frozen peaches; coarsely
-chopped.  You can use fresh
-peaches, but you must peel
-and remove the stones.
1/2 c  Yellow raisins
1 tb Orange peel; grated
1 c  Orange juice or more, as
-needed
2 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Butter (1 stick)
1 pk Herb seasoned stuffing mix
-(8 oz size)
MMMMM----------------------PEACH WINE GLAZE---------------------------
1 c  Peach jam
1/2 c  Butter (1 stick)
1/4 c  Dry white wine
Season hens lightly with salt, garlic powder, and ginger. Dust
lightly with flour.

To make stuffing:  In a saucepan, combine first 7 ingredients and
simmer mixture for 10 minutes.  Add the stuffing mix and stir to
combine. Add a little orange juice, if necessary, so that the
stuffing is soft, but not soupy.

Stuff the hens about 3/4 full and close them with skewers.

Brush the hens generously with melted butter and roast them in a 325
degree oven for 45 minutes, basting them every 15 minutes. Now baste
with Peach Wine Glaze and continue baking and basting for an
additional 30 minutes. Hens will be nicely glazed and browned. Remove
skewers and serve with a buttered vegetable.

Peach Wine Glaze:  In a saucepan, heat together all the ingredients
until butter is melted and mixture is blended.

Note:  Be certain to bake the hens right after stuffing them so that
harmful bacteria does not form. If there are any leftovers, please
remove the stuffing from the hen's cavity before refrigerating.
