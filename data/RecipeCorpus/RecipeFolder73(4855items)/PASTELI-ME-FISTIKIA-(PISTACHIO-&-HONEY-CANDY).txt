Yield: 50 Servings
Karen Mintzias
1 lb Fresh, unsalted pistachios
1 1/4 c  Sugar
1 c  Honey
1 1/2 c  Water
Butter or oil
Peel and place pistachios on a baking sheet, the put in a slow
oven (250 F) to roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cut
into quarters.

Meanwhile combine the sugar, honey, and water in a heavy pan, and
stir over medium heat until dissolved. Lower the heat and boil to the
very firm stage (250 to 256 degrees), toss in the pistachio nuts and
stir, then remove from the heat.  Butter or oil a marble slab, jelly
roll, or any aluminum pan and quickly spread the candy using a
spatula or knife. Allow to cool, the cut into squares and store in
covered containers.

Author's note: A Greek pastry chef told me that glucose and honey are
usually used for this excellent treat.
