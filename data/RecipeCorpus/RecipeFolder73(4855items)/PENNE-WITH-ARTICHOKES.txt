Cut the stems and the top 1/4" from each baby artichoke. Snap off the
outer green leaves. Trim all dark green from the bottom. Cut into
quarters. Rub cut surfaces with lemon half.

Heat oil in large covered skillet or sauce pan.  Add quartered
artichokes. Saute, stirring often, until golden brown (about 7
minutes). Add onion and garlic. Saute until soft (about 2 minutes).
Add wine, allow to reduce slightly (another 2 minutes, perhaps) and
then stir in tomatoes, water and thyme.  Cover.  Cook over low heat
until very tender, 30 minutes.

Boil water for penne.

Remove cover from artichokes.  Add salt and red pepper flakes to
taste. Cook, uncovered for five minutes to slightly thicken sauce.
Shave parmesan. Cook penne.

Drain penne, and toss with artichokes and minced parsley. Serve warm
or at room temperature, topped with shavings of parmesan cheese.
