SAUCE-Preheat a heavy non-aluminum Dutch oven or similar 6-qt pot over
moderately high heat and add the olive oiil. When the oil is
fragrant, add the chicken meat pieces and saute, turning frequently
for 5 or minutes until lightly browned on all sides. Add the onions
and carrots and saute, stirring constantly, until the onions are
trnaslucent, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and saute about 30
seconds. Do not allow the garlic to brown. Immediately add the broth
to the pot. Stir bits and pieces loose from the bottom of the pot.
Add all additional ingredients, lower the heat to a gently simmer and
cover the pot. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the
chicken meat pieces are tender, but not soft, about 5 to 10 minutes.
As the sauce is finishing cooking, add 3 tb oil to a heavy skillet
and saute the bell peppers, squashes and broccoli over medium heat
until just crisp-tender. Add the veggies to the sauce when the
chicken meat is tender, blend all together and turn off the heat.
Adjust the salt, pepper and herb levels to taste. Toss the cooked
pasta with 1 tb oil to prevent sticking and add to the sauce; blend
chicken, veggies and sauce thoroughly and serve along with Parmesan
cheese. Source: The Olive Garden.
