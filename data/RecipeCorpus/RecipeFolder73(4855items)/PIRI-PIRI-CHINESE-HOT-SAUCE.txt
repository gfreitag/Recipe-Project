I felt like a chemist making the stuff.  I put it on a back burner
under the vent and stood back while stirring it. I didn't know what
to expect. I tasted the sauce by just dipping a spoon into it and
letting the sauce drain off the spoon and then gently taking a little
taste by placing the spoon on the tip of my tongue. At first nothing,
then after about 15 seconds or so it kicks in. Actually tasted pretty
good. Walt MM
