Cook the diced potatoes by modified boiling or by cooking them in a
pressure cooker until they are tender. Keep warm until needed.

While the potatoes are cooking, heat the oil in a large skillet. Add
the onion, garlic, and thyme. Saute for 2-3 minutes.

Wash and drain the buckwheat; then add it to the skillet with the
onions. Stir constantly for about 3 minutes.

Remove the skillet from the heat and pour the boiling water over teh
buckwheat. Thencover the skillet, return it to the heat, and simmer
over low heat until the water is absorbed (about 20 minutes).

Add the hot, cooked potatoes and toss lightly.

Place each portion on an individual serving plate and cover it with
sauce. Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired.

Variations:

Add about 1 pound of tofu, cut into small cubes, along with the
potatoes. This addition goes best with the Tahini Miso Sauce.

Serve with Ginger Tofu and replace the Tahini Miso Sauce or the Tofu
and Peanut Sauce with the sauce from the Ginger Tofu recipe.
