Title: PIG NEWTONS
Categories: Appetizers, Spam
Yield: 1 Servings
1 cn Spam
1 cn Pillsbury Crescent Rolls
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Cut the Spam slab in half, then in
1/4 inch slices. Unroll the crescent rolls and separate into 2 long
rectangles. Pat the remaining preforations in the rectangles closed.
Lay the Spam slices end to end down the middle of the dough from one
short edge to the other. Bring the sides to lap over the Spam and
seal with your fingers. Turn over the whole thing. Slice this into 1
to 1 1/2 inch sections and place seam side down on a cookie sheet.
Repeat for the second piece of dough and the remaining Spam. Bake
15-20 minutes until golden brown.

Note: They look like pink Fig Newtons (TM). You may have a few pieces
left for spushie (raw Spam) yum, yum. and We took this to a fancy
cocktail party once and the Pig Newtons were gone before the shrimp!
Serve with a good American Pale Ale, Geary's or Sierra Nevada if you
are home-brew deprived.
