Title: PIROHI DOUGH & FILLINGS
Categories: Christmas, Ethnic, Holiday, Polish
Yield: 6 Servings
Potato water, no salt
4 lg Eggs, beaten
4    To 5 pound flour
PIROHI DOUGH:

Mix together the three ingredients. Knead until hard enough to roll
out like a pie crust. Over-kneading will make it tough.

Roll out - not too thick or thin. Cut into squares.

All fillings (below) should be cold when placed in the center of the
square. Fold dough in half to form a triangle. Tuck in corners and
pinch edges together. Keep fingers dry. When all of the pirohi are
made, drop a few at a time in a pot of salted boiling water. Cook,
for 3 or 4 minutes - should come to the top of the water when cooked.
Remove pirohi from pot and throw into cold water. Remove immediately.
Dry on cloth or brush with butter to prevent them from sticking
together. They may be frozen when dry.

To serve: Place in pan with a little water. Cover with foil and warm
in oven. When warm, pour butter or onion mixture on top and serve.

PIROHI FILLINGS

CABBAGE:

1 can sauerkraut (squeeze out the juice) Vegetable oil 1 head cabbage
1 cup mashed potatoes Salt

Shred and scald cabbage - put in pot of cold water; cook until almost
boiling; drain. Fry cabbage and sauerkraut in oil until golden -
about 3 or 4 minutes. Mix potatoes and salt with cabbage mixture. The
potato will not be tasted; it holds the mixture together.

CHEESE:

1 pound potted cheese 1 cup sweet cream 1 large egg Salt

Blend enough of the cream with the other ingredients to hold it
together.

PRUNES:

Dry prunes, large

Cook prunes until tender. Remove pits. May be rolled in sugar before
placed in pirohi.

POTATOES

3    large potatoes Onion mixture

Boil potatoes in unsalted water. Save water for the dough. Mash and
mix with onion mixture.
