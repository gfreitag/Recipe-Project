Title: PEERLESS CORNBREAD
Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Cake flour
2/3 c  Yellow cornmeal
1 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
1    Egg -- room temperature
1/2 c  Butter -- (1 stick)  melted
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 c  Milk -- warmed
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a 9-inch round, 1 1/2-inch
deep cake pan. With a fork, stir together the cake flour, cornmeal,
baking powder, salt and sugar. Beat the egg, melted butter, oil and
milk in a large mixing bowl until well blended. Add the dry
ingredients to the egg mixture and stir until blended. The batter
will be somewhat thin and light. Pour the batter into the prepared
pan and bake for about 15 minutes, until a straw inserted in the
center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Press the center of the
bread; if it feels slightly firm the bread is done. Be careful not to
overbake. Serve warm wedges of the cornbread with butter and honey.
Yield: 1 9-inch round loaf
