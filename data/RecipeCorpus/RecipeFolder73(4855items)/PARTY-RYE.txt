Title: PARTY RYE
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Hot sausage
1    Onion (chopped)
1 lb Mild sausage
1 ts Italian seasoning
2 lb Velvetta cheese
2    Loaves party rye
Cook sausage and onions, stirring often.  This keeps the sausage in
small chunks.  (I like to fry the sausage in water because that helps
drain off more of the fat.) Add cheese and seasoning and heat until
cheese is melted. Put bread slices on a cookie sheet and spread the
mixture over the bread. Freeze until ready to serve. When ready to
serve, remove from the freezer and bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.

(One loaf of Rye bread makes forty slices)
