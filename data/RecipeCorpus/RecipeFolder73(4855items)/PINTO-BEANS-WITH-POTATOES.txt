Categories: Main dish, African, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Dried pinto beans, soaked
3 lg Potatoes, chopped*

Cover pinto beans with enough water to cover & bring to a boil.
Reduce heat & simmer until they are just tender. Add potatoes, celery
& salt & more water if necessary. Cook over low heat. Just before the
potatoes & beans are tender, gently fry the onions in a heavy
skillet. Using a slotted spoon, add the beans to the skillet & stir
until well mixed & heated through.  Serve hot over rice or a stiff
porridge. *This dish traditionally uses manioc (casava) in place of
the potatoes. If you can get it, use it.
