Dishes which require a long cooking period are particularly
successful when prepared in a clay pot.

Soak the pot in water for 10 minutes.  Dredge the veal in flour
combined with salt, pepper, oregano, parsley and lemon rind. Place
the veal in the pot and add the garlic, carrots, celery, tomato
paste, wine and oil. Cover and place in a cold oven.  Adjust the heat
to 450F and cook for 1 1/2 hours.  Combine the cornstarch with water
and stir into the pot juices. Return to the oven, uncovered, and
continue cooking for 10 minutes until the juices have thickened.
Garnish with lemon slices and serve with rice.

Makes 4 servings.
