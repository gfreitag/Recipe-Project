Categories: Pasta, Sauces, Low-cal, Low-fat
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Large, firm, ripe tomatoes
1 lg Long, red, dried New Mexican
-chile (about 1 1/2 ounces)
1 tb Olive oil
2 md Garlic cloves, chopped fine
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Dried oregano
1 1/2 tb Fresh cilantro, chopped
Cooked Pasta
Preheat oven to 500. With a fork, pierce the tomatoes near their stem
ends. Put them in a baking pan lined with aluminum foil. Put the
chile in a separate foil-lined pan. Put both pans in the oven. Roast
the chile until it turns evenly dark brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove it
from the oven and set it aside. Continue roasting the tomatoes until
their skins are evenly blackened, about 45 minutes. With your hands,
split open the chile and remove its stem and seeds. Break its flesh
and skin into a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Pulse the
machine on and off several times until the chile is finely chopped.
Add the tomatoes to the processor, including their skins and any
juices that have collected in the pan. Pulse the machine until the
tomatoes are chopped to a coarse puree. In a large saucepan or
skillet, heat the oil with the garlic over moderate heat. When the
garlic begins to brown, add the tomato-chile mixture and stir in the
sugar and olive oregano. Simmer until thick but still slightly
liquid, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cilantro and serve over cooked
pasta.
