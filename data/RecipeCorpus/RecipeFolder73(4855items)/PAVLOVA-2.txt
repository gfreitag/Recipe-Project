Title: PAVLOVA 2
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
5    Egg whites
2 ts Cornflour
1 ts Malt vinegar
10 oz Caster sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla essence
Filling
1/2 pt Cream
3 ts Castor sugar
1 ts Orange flavoured liqueur
(I use Grand Marnier)
1 lb Fresh fruit salad
Draw a 9" circle on a baking sheet, preheat oven to to a cool 150øC or
300øF.

Beat egg whites until stiff. Add 4 oz of the sugar and continue
beating for one minute or until the mixture is stiff and glossy.

Fold in remaining sugar, cornflour, vanilla and vinegar.

Spoon 1/3 of the meringue mixture onto the baking sheet and spread
out into the shape of the circle. Put remainder of the mixture in a
piping bag and pipe around the edge of the circle.

Bake for 1 1/2 hours (yes 90 minutes) or until firm and very lightly
browned. Allow to cool completely.

Whip the cream and fold in the sugar and the liqueur. Fill the
meringue case with the cream, and then pile the fruit salad in the
centre on top of it.

Pavlova is a traditional Australian dessert. It is essentially a
meringue base, filled with fresh fruit salad and cream, and is served
with ice cream, jelly and any other sweet goop that appeals at the
time.

There are many permutations, but the essence of the dish is the
meringue shell filled with cream and then fruit salad.

Here the fruit salad might consist of pineapple, passionfruit,
strawberries, kiwi fruit, melons, all diced and mixed.

Jelly here is what I think Jello is in the US.
