~----------------- Mix the meat, onion, salt, Worcestershire sauce,
and pepper together. Shape the mixture into 6 patties, each about
3/4-inch thick. Mix Parmesan cheese and cornflake crumbs.  Dip the
patties into the egg, then coat them with the cornflake mixture.
Brown the patties in a large skillet over medium heat, turning once.
Drain off the excess fat. Mix the tomato sauce and Italian seasoning
and pour over the patties in the skillet. Cover and simmer for 15
minutes.  Top each patty with a slice of cheese and cover. Heat until
the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes. Serve the leftover sauce over
the patties.
