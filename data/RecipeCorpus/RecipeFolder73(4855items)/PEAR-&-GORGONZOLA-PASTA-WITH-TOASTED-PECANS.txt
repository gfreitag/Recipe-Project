Categories: Entree
12 oz dried spaghetti
Yield: 4 Servings
16 oz pears -- soft-ripe
1 TB fresh lemon juice

:

Pears: Bartlett, red Bartlett, or d'Anjou pears (1/2 lb. each). For
the best flavor and texture, choose pears ripe enough to yield to
gentle pressure near the stem. Blue-veined cheeses such as gorgonzola
and cambozola have a rich, nutty flavor; Danish blue tastes sharper.
The American blue cheese is sharper.

This pasta entree was first tried at Ristorante Ecco in San Francisco.
