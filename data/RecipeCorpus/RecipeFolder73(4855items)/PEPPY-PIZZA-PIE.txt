10-inch pie pan. Sprinkle the mushrooms and olives in the meat line
pan then pour the remaining tomato sauce over the vegetables. Bake
uncovered for 25 minutes. The pepperoni gives a red-flecked
appearance to the meat. Sprinkle the pie with the shredded cheese and
bake an additional 5 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes then cut into 6
wedges. NOTE: If a 10-inch pie pan is not available, use a 9-inch one
but put a pan under it to catch the run off of juices. Also you can
use an 8 oz can of cut green beans or whole kernel corn in place of
the mushrooms if desired.
