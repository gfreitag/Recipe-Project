Title: PINK PICKLED SHALLOTS (KN4)
Categories: Relishes, Kooknet, Side dishes
Yield: 2 Half pints
3/4 lb Firm, Fresh Shallots
3/4 c  Red Wine Vinegar
1/4 c  Granulated Sugar
1/2 c  Water
2 ts Whole Peppercorns, Pink
1 ts Mustard Seed
1    Bay Leaf; bruised
4    Fresh Thyme Sprigs; bruised
Peel and cut the shallots lengthwise or crosswise into thin slices.
Set aside. In a small, non-aluminum saucepan, combine the vinegar,
sugar, water, peppercorns, mustard seed, bay leaf and thyme. Bring to
a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 2-3
minutes. Remove from heat and cool.

Using a slotted spoon, pack the shallots into clean, dry jars with
lids. Ladle in the vinegar mixture, dividing the spices and herbs as
evenly among the jars as possible. Attach lids. Store the shallots in
the refrigerator at least a week before using. Will keep for several
months.
