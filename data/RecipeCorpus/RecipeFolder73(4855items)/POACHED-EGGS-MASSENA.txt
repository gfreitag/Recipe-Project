MMMMM----------------------BEARNAISE SAUCE---------------------------
2/3 c  Dry white wine
1/3 c  Tarragon vinegar
3 tb Shallots, minced
2 tb Fresh tarragon, chopped
1/2 ts White pepper
1/2 c  Unsalted butter (1 stick)
3    Egg yolks
Salt and cayenne pepper
4    Whole eggs
2 qt Water
1 tb Wine vinegar
Artichoke Preparation: Cut the stems and most of the leaves off the
artichoke. With a paring knife, whittle off the leaves at the base to
expose the heart. Scrape the fibrous "choke" to leave only the
disk-shaped heart.  Rub the heart with lemon. Cook with salted
boiling water for about 8 minutes.  Drain and refresh with cold
water. Set aside. Bearnaise Sauce: In a heavy saucepan, combine wine,
tarragon vinegar, shallots, fresh tarragon and white pepper.  Boil to
reduce to 3 tablespoons. Let cool. Meanwhile, melt the butter; cool
slightly. Add egg yolks to vinegar mixture and cook over low heat,
whisking constantly, for 1 minute or until the consistancy of
mayonnaise. Do not overcook or it will curdle. Whisk in the warm
melted butter in a thin stream into the wine mixture. The sauce will
thicken. Whisk in salt, cayenne and white pepper to taste. Keep warm
in a pan of warm water. Poach the 4 eggs 3 minutes in 2 quarts of
water and 1 tablespoon wine vinegar. Remove with a slotted spoon and
trim edges. Keep in warm water. To assemble, heat the artichoke
hearts and blot dry. Spoon a bit of the Bearnaise Sauce into each
heart. Place a poached egg on top and spoon more sauce over. Serve at
once.
