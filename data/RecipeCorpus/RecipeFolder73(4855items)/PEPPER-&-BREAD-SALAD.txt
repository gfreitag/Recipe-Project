Spear pepper with fork and hold over open flame until it blisters all
over. Place in plastic bag and set aside until skin loosens, about 30
minutes. Meanwhile, place bread cubes in colander and hold under cold
water to dampen.  Squeeze bread dry.  Place in salad bowl. Add
capers, thyme, green onion and celery. Using sharp paring knife, peel
skin off pepper. Core and dice into half-inch pieces. Add to bread
salad. Stir together oil, vinegar, mustard and pepper to taste in
small cup. Pour over salad and toss well. NOTE: A good quality,
crusty French bread is essential for this salad. It should be at
least one day old. If still soft, place bread cubes on baking sheet
and toast at 350 degrees for 5 to 10 minutes.
