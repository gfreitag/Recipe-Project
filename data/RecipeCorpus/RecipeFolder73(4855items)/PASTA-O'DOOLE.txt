Title: PASTA O'DOOLE
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Small seashells or macaroni
1 cn Great northern beans (no
Other beans taste as good as
These)
16 oz Tomato sauce (use the plain
Variety not the spaghetti
Sauce)
Mix beans (with the liquid) with the tomato sauce and heat. Prepare
pasta and toss with sauce. Add tons of black pepper and eat. I used a
jumbo can of diced tomatoes and pureed them instead since I was out
of the plain tomato sauce. Guess what I ate for lunch today?? This.

Source: This is an old family treat that my Mom used to make when Dad
was out of town since he hates beans.
