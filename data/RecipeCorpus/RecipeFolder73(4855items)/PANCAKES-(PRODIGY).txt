Title: PANCAKES (PRODIGY)
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 3 Servings
3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1 ts (scant) baking powder
1    Egg
1 1/2 tb Vegetable oil
5/8 c  Low-fat milk
SIFT THE DRY INGREDIENTS together into a bowl. Combine the egg, oil
and milk together in another bowl, then stir them into the dry
ingredients until batter is just smooth. Lightly grease a large
skillet or griddle. When hot, ladle the batter onto the griddle.
(Usually, 3 pancakes fit in a large skillet.) Adjust heat to
medium-high. When bubbles appear on the surface of the pancake,
usually after 2 to 3 minutes, lift with a spatula to see that the
underside is browned. Turn and cook the second side until browned,
about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.

Makes 3 Servings (6 4-inch pancakes)
