Grease muffin tins and fill 2/3 full. Bake in 400 degree oven for
about 20 minutes.   Serve with butter and grape jelly!!!!Friend who
gave this to me says they're great. I wonder if they'd be like
chocolate peanut butter cups if  you serve  it  with chocolate syrup
on top.........oh I'm just fantasizing!!!
This uses the real water, not the dehydrated kind.
