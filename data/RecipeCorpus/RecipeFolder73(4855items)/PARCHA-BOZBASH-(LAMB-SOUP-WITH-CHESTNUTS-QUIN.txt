Categories: Soups, Lamb/mutton, Ayzeri
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Boneless lean lamb
; cut in 1" cubes
Salt; to taste
Pepper, black; to taste
3 tb Butter
1 md Onion, finely chopped
4 c  Beef broth
1 md Potato, peeled and cubed
1 sm Quince; peeled/cored/cubed
1/2 c  Dried pitted prunes
OR 1 c fresh sour prunes
1/4 lb Chestnuts, shelled & peeled
2/3 c  Canned chick-peas*
; drained & rinsed
2 tb Ghi
Season the lamb with salt and pepper.  In a heavy pot, melt the 3 tb.
butter over moderate heat.  Add the lamb and onion; saute until
browned, stirring frequently. Add the broth; season to taste with
salt. Cover; simmer 30 minutes.

Add the potato, quince, prunes, and chestnuts.  Cover; simmer 20
minutes. Add the chick-peas and simmer, covered, about 15 minutes or
until done. Stir in the clarified butter and allow to melt before
serving soup.

Note:  1/4 tsp. ginger or a pinch of powdered saffron dissolved in 2
tb. warm water may be added with the chick-peas, and the soup served
sprinkled with 1 ts. crushed dried mint, accompanied by chopped onion
and sumakh on the side.  In the Caucasus, ground kyurdyuk is normally
used instead of the clarified butter, and dried chick-peas* rather
than canned ones. The dried chick-peas are soaked several hours,
drained, and added at the beginning with the broth.

Personal note:  I've found sumakh (labelled as sumac, a spice
mixture) at Middle Eastern groceries.

The author describes this soup as an "outstanding" Azerbaidzhani soup.
