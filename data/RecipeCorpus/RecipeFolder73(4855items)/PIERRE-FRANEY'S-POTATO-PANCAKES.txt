Title: PIERRE FRANEY'S POTATO PANCAKES
Categories: Potatoes
Yield: 4 Servings
3    Potatoes (about 1.25 lbs)
Salt to taste
1 tb Butter
1/3 c  Half-and-half
2    Eggs, lightly beaten
1/3 c  Flour
1/4 c  Finely chopped onion
1/2 ts Minced garlic
2 tb Finely chopped parsley
Freshly ground pepper to
Taste
2 tb Vegetable oil
Put the potatoes in a saucepan and add cold water to cover and salt.
Bring to the boil and cook until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain and
peel the potatoes and put them through a food mill or potato ricer.
In a mixing bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, butter, half-and-half,
eggs, flour, onion, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper. Blend well.
Heat the oil in a skillet, preferably nonstick.  Spoon potato mixture
into mounds and flatten to make patty shape.  Cook 3 to 4 minutes, or
until golden brown on one side.  Turn and cook 3-4 minutes on the
second side, or until golden brown. Do not overcook or pancakes will
be dry to the taste. Serve hot.
