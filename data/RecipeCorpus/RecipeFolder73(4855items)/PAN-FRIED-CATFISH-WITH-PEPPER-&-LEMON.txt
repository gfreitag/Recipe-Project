Title: PAN-FRIED CATFISH WITH PEPPER & LEMON
Categories: Fish, Catfish, Stove top
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Lemon peel - grated
2/3 c  Buttermilk
2 tb Butter
1 tb Parsley, minced
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
4    Catfish fillets
1 tb Vegetble oil
Lemon wedges
Combine cornmeal, flour, lemon peel and cayenne in shallow dish.
Season with salt.  Pour buttermilk into second shallow dish. Dip 1
fish fillet into buttermilk, then into cornmeal mixture, coating
completely. Repeat process with remaining fish.  (Note from me: Let
fish stand for approximately 15 minutes before proceeding.) Melt
butter with oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
fish and cook until crust is golden brown and fish is cooked through,
turning once, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer fish to platter.
Sprinkle with minced parsley. Garnish with lemon wedges.

NOTE:  If you let the fish sit coated for the 15 minutes that I
recommend, this dish will take 45 minutes. Believe me, let the fish
sit for the 15 minutes; it will keep the coating on the fish with no
hassle whatsoever.
