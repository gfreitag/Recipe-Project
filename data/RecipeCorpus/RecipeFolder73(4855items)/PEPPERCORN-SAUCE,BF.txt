Categories: Sauces, Beef, Condiment, Dressings, Salads
4 ea Rib eye steaks -- 1"
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Heavy cream
2 TB Butter
1 TB Peppercorns -- *
1/2 c  Sherry

*Drained canned and mashed The following green peppercorn sauce can
be made many good cuts of steak but I prefer a rib eye or New York
cut: Pat steaks dry and season with salt and pepper. In a heavy
skillet, heat the butter over moderately high heat until it is hot.
Saute the steaks for 3 minutes on each each side for medium rare.
Transfer the steaks to a warm platter and keep warm, covered loosely
in the oven. Add sherry to the skillet, and deglaze it, scraping up
the brown bits and boil the sherry, stirring, until it is reduced by
half. Add cream and peppercorns and boil the sauce, stirring, until
it is thickened slightly. Add the steaks, simmer the mixture, turning
the steaks to coat them with the sauce for 1 minute. Transfer the
steaks to a heated platter.
