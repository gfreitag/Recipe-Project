Title: PEACH MELBA MERINGUES
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lg Peaches, Skinned and stones

4    Tinned peach halves, drained
12 oz Fresh raspberries
1    Egg White
2 oz Caster Sugar
2 oz Icing Sugar, sieved
2 tb Lemon Juice
Mint Sprigs, to decorate
Preheat oven to 220C/400F/Gas Mark 6.

To skin peaches, immerse in boiling water for 30 seconds, then
transfer to a bowl of cold water. With a small sharp knife, loosen
skin at stalk end and gently peel from the flesh, taking care not to
tear it. Place peach halves in a baking dish and put a few
raspberries in each hollow.

Whisk the egg white until stiff. Gradually add caster sugar, whisking
between each addition, until thick and glossy. Place a swirl of
meringue on top of each peach half and bake in a preheated oven for
10 minutes until golden.

Rub remaining raspberries through a sieve, add icing sugar to the
puree and mix well. Add lemon juice to taste.

Place baked peaches on a plate and drizzle raspberry sauce around the
base. Garnish with mint.
