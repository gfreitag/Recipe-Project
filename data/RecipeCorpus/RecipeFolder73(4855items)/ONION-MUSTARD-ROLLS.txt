From The Bread Book by Lena Sturges.  Dissolve yeast in water. Heat
milk until almost simmering.  Into large bowl measure sugar, mustard,
salt, pepper, 2 Tbsp instant minced onion and shortening. Stir in
milk until sugar dissolves and shortening melts.  Cool to lukewarm.
Stir in about 2 cups flour and beat until smooth. Beat in yeast. Stir
in enough additional flour to make a moderately stiff dough.
Onto lightly floured surface, turn out dough and kenad until
smooth and satiny, 5 to 8 minutes.  Shape into ball and place in
lightly greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover and let rise
in warm place until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.  Punch down. Divide
dough into 2 equal portions; shape into balls.  Let rest 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, grease two large baking sheets.
Roll or pat each half of dough into a 9-inch square. Using sharp
knife, cut each into 9 squares. Tuck corners under to form buns.
Place on baking sheet and flatten with palm of hand. Let rise in warm
place until doubled, about 30 minutes.  Combine 2 Tbsp instant minced
onion and 1/4 cup water; allow to stand 5 minutes. Just before
baking, sprinkle buns with onion and poppy seeds, 25 to 30 minutes or
until golden brown. Yield: 18 sandwich buns.
