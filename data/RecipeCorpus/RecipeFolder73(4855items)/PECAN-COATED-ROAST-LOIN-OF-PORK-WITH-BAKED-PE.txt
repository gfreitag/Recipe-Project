Categories: Meats, Pork, Holiday, Kwanzaa
Yield: 6 Servings
4 lb Boneless loin of pork
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 ts Powered sage
1 ts Garlic; minced
Salt and pepper to taste
3 tb Dark brown sugar; packed
1/4 lb Peacan halves; finely chop
8    Canned, freestone peach
-halves
Freshly ground nutmeg
Rub the pork throughly with olive oil.  Combine the sage, thyme,
garlic, salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar in a food
processor or blender and pulse until you have a thick paste. (You may
have to add a drizzle of olive oil to get it started). Slather the
paste over the pork loin, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate it
overnight. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Roll the pork loin in the
chopped pecans and place it in a roasting pan.  Make a tent of
aluminum foil and arrange it over the pork loin, covering the nuts
completely so that they won't char. Roast for 30 minutes; then lower
the heat to 350 degrees. After 30 more minutes, place the peach
halves around it in the bottom of the roasting pan. Sprinkle with
remaining brown sugar and a grinding of nutmeg. After 20 more
minutes, remove foil and continue to roast until the pork is done,
about 20 minutes more.
