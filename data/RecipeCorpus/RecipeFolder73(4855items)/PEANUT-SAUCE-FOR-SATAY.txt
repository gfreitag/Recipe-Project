minutes Meanwhile, dissolve sugar in fish sauce or soy sauce and
tamarind liquid or lime juice.  When onion is browned, add soy sauce
mixture and 1/2 cup coconut milk to pan.  Stir in peanut butter and
cook 5 minutes longer,stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Remove
pan from heat and let cool enough to taste.  It should be pleasantly
hot, but balanced by the sweetness of the sugar, the cooling coconut
milk and the tart flavor of the tamarind. Adjust seasoning
accordingly. Stir in chopped cilantro and serve warm or at room temp.
If it is too thick, thin with coconut milk or water. Garnish with
more cilantro. Makes about 1 1/2 cups
