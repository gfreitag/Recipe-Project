Title: PANFRIED LAKE TROUT FILLETS IN TEMPURA BATTER
Categories: Fish, Jw
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Lake trout fillet or
4    Steaks
1 ts Lemon zest; grated
2 tb Lemon juice
1/4 c  Water
1 c  Corn flour
1 ts Baking powder
1    Egg white
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
Cut fish fillets in half lengthwise.  Combine lemon zest, lemon juice
and water.  Blend in corn flour to form a smooth batter; stir in the
baking powder.  Set aside for 10 minutes.  Beat egg until soft peaks
form. Fold into batter.  Dip fillets in batter, then allow excess to
drain. Shallow fry fish in hot oil for 2 minutes on each side or
until flesh flakes. This is also a great batter for deep fried fish
of all kinds as well.
