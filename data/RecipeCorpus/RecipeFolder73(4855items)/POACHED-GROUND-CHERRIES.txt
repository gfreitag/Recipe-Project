Title: POACHED GROUND-CHERRIES
Categories: Fruit
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Water
4 sl Lemon
1 1/2 pt Ground cherries
"Surprisingly little known nowadays, ground-cherries used to be one
of the more common fruits and still are one of the more delicious.
They grow wild throughout a great part of the courty and are
cultivated in Pennsylvania and the West. In Europe, where there are
different types -- they all belong to the genus Physalis -- they are
eaten raw and used for compotes. In Australia, where the larger ones
are called Cape gooseberries, they are canned and shipped to the rest
of the world. Ground-cherries make wonderful pocket fruit, for each
one is securely packed in its own little husk. When eaten raw they
are refreshingly sweet and rich. It is mystifying to me that they are
not more prized."

Combine the sugar and water, bring to a boil, and boil 8 to 10
minutes. Add the lemon and ground-cherries and cook 5 minutes, at a
rolling boil, removing any scum that forms. Reduce heat, and simmer
until the ground-cherries are just cooked through, about 12 minutes
in all. Cool in the syrup. Serve as a topping for ice cream, or serve
warm over sponge cake or angel cake with whipped cream.
