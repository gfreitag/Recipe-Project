Title: PASTA WITH VEGETABLES
Categories: Pasta, Low-fat, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 Servings
6 oz Pasta, non-egg, your choice
(I like Rotelle for this)
1 ea Yellow onion, largeish
1 ea Green Bell pepper
6 ea Mushrooms, medium
1 ea Zuccini squash
1 cn Hunt's "Light" fat-free
Spaghetti Sauce (26.75 oz)
1 ea Weight Watcher's brand
Fat-free "Grated Parmesan
Italian Topping"
Start a pot of water on high for the pasta, and put a large non-stick
skillet on medium high heat (no added lubrication.) When the water
boils, dump the pasta in and look at the clock.

Meanwhile, wash and cut up the veggies in the sequence given, dumping
each into the skillet and stiring before going on to the next. The
key to this recipe is to cut the vegetables into large enough chunks,
and not to overcook them.  Cut onion into quarters, then slice about
3/4 inch thick. Likewise for the pepper, removing stem, seeds, and
soft parts. Cut mushrooms in half, or quarters if larger. Cut the
zuke in half lengthwise, then slice 1/2 inch thick.

When the pasta has boiled for 10 to 12 minutes, take it off and drain
it. Check that the vegies are not still raw, then pour the can of
sauce in with them. Divide the pasta onto serving plates while the
sauce is heating. Stir the sauce, and when it's hot through, spoon
over the pasta. Top generously to taste with the phony parmesan.

Makes 2 large or 3 smaller servings.  Elapsed time under 20 minutes.
Zero grams fat.
