Categories: Sauces
Yield: 2 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
2 lb Zante grapes *
8 c  Champagne vinegar
4 c  Sugar
5    Or 6 whole allspice berries
* (also called Zante currants and Champagne grapes)

This simple recipe comes from Judy Rodgers of the Zuni Cafe in San
Francisco. She emphasizes using only the most impeccable fruits and
choosing the perfect jar to put them in.

Wash grapes. Remove any damaged or blemished ones. Put in a jar just
large en enough to hold them. Combine remaining ingredi- ents in a
saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 2 or 3 minutes.
Let cool completely. Pour over the grapes, cover and refrigerate 1
week before using. Will keep months in the refrigerator.

Makes about 2 quarts.
