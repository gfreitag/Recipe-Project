Title: PATE A LA RAPTURE  <RAPPIE PIE>
Categories: Chicken, Canadian, Historical, Pies
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Peck potatoes
2    Chickens (3 or 3 1/2 lbs
Each)
3 lg Onions
1/4 lb Butter
6    Strips bacon
Salt & pepper to taste
Poultry seasoning
You will need a grater, a large pan (17"x12"x2"), and a sturdy cloth
bag. Simmer the chickens in a pot on top of the stove with plenty of
onions and seasonings. When cooked, separate the meat from the bones
and chop meat into pieces.  Save the broth.

Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and soak in cold water. Grate about 10
potatoes at a time and then place them in a cloth bag.  Squeeze
tightly until all the water and starch is removed.  Do all the
potatoes this way.

Save the liquid from the potatoes: measure it. You must measure an
equal amount of chicken broth to replace the potato water. When the
potatoes are all squeezed, loosen them in a large pan and gradually
add the measured chicken broth, stirring slowly. The potatoes may
take on a jelly-like appearance. Be sure there are no lumps. Add
seasonings and stir, stir, stir!

Cover the bottom of a well-greased pan with half the potato mixture.
Arrange chicken pieces, chopped onion, and pats of butter on top.
Cover with the other half of the potato mixture.  Then add a bit of
chopped onion, more pats of butter and six strips of bacon. This will
form the crust.  Place pie in a hot (400F) oven for about 2 hours, or
until a brown crust is formed.

Delicious with applesauce or cranberry sauce.

Serves 12.
