Title: PEPPER COATED STUFFED FLANK STEAK
Categories: Beef
Yield: 2 Servings  2 tablespoon instant minced onion 2 tablespoon water 4 tablespoon
vegetable oil divided 1 lb fresh mushrooms chopped 1 1/4 teaspoon
salt divided 1/4 cup dry bread crumbs 1 beaten egg 1 teaspoon coarse
ground black pepper

Pierce both sides of steak with fork tines. To make pockets for
stuffing, with a sharp pointed knife make a crosswise slit in center
of the steak, without cutting through to the bottom, leaving 1/2 inch
uncut on each side. Make a lengthwise pocket on each side by cutting
through the center of the meat to within 1 inch of the sides. Combine
onion with water; set aside for 10 minutes to soften. In a large
skillet heat 2 tablespoon of the oil. Add onion; saute until golden,
about 1 minute. Add mushrooms and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt; saute
until all of the liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes. Add bread
crumbs and egg; mix well and cool. Spoon mushroom mixture into
pockets of steak with remaining 2 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle steak on
both sides with black pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook
over coals 4 minutes on each side for medium rare. * Origin: The
