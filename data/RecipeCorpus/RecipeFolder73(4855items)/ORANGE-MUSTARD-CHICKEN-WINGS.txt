Stephen Ceideburg
2 tb Vegetable oil
2    Garlic cloves, peeled and
-chopped
1/2    Onion, peeled and chopped
1 c  Orange marmalade
1/2 c  Dijon-style mustard
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 tb Dry mustard
1 tb Brown sugar
2 tb Cider vinegar
1/2 ts Salt
24    Chicken wings, about 2 1/2
-pounds
Thoroughly glazed and wonderfully sticky, these are just the way
chicken wings should be. Serve with plain white rice, a green salad
and lots of napkins!

Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and onion and
saute until translucent. Stir in marmalade and re- maining
ingredients except chicken wings. Reduce heat and simmer for 10
minutes, stirring often. Cool.

Put the chicken wings in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Pour the
sauce over the wings, turning to make sure they are well coated. Let
stand for an hour or more, turning from time to time.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Put chicken wings on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake for 20 to 30
minutes, basting occasionally with the sauce left in the bowl.
