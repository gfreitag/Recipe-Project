Title: PICKLED EGGS (DECK)
Categories: Canning, Preserves, Relishes
Yield: 1 Servings
Eggs
Canned beets
White vinegar
Pickling spices
Boil the eggs by putting them in a pan and covering them with ice cold
water.  Put the pan on the stove and bring it to a boil. Remove the
pan from the heat and cover it. Leave it alone for about 20 minutes.
At that time, drain the hot water and refill the pan with ice cold
water to stop the cooking and make them easy to peel. Peel the eggs.
Put them in a large jar. Open a can of beets and pour them over the
eggs. Throw in about a tablespoon of pickling spice (more if you are
doing a lot of eggs), and fill the jar with white vinegar so that all
eggs are completely submerged. Cap the jar and put it in the
refrigerator and let them pickle for at least 2 weeks.  The longer
you let them pickle, the more intense the color (purple!)...and if
you leave them long enough, they'll pickle all the way to the yolk.
These are delicious.
