12 lg Oranges
200 g  Sugar (7 oz)
3 tb Grand Marnier or Cointreau
2 tb Grenadine syrup
ORANGES A L'ORIENTALE Peel the zest from the oranges in long strips,
taking as little of the pith as possible. Cut the zest into very,
very fine julienne strips. Remove the pith in vertical strips to
expose the flesh of the oranges. Then, holding the oranges over a
strainer with a bowl beneath to catch all the juice, cut each segment
away from the membranes that divide one from another, and from the
central core of pith. Squeeze all the discarded membranes to extract
every drop of juice, if any flesh remains on them, and add it to the
already collected juice. Blanch the julienned zest in bouling water
for 1 minute. Refresh in cold water and drain in a sieve. Put the
sugar into a large, wide saucepan and cook over a moderate, steady
heat until the sugar melts and becomes a light golden color. Add the
collected orange juice and, stirring to mix well, cook until the
liquid has the consistency of a light syrup. Add the julienned zest
to the sysrup, as well as the liqueur and the grenadine syrup. If a
scum forms, remove it with a spoon as if you were making jam. Bring
it briefly to the boil. Add the orange segments and shake the pan
well so that they all absorb the syrup. They should be hot, but they
should not be allowed to cook. Set the pan aside. Add another drop of
liqueur to the pan. SERVING: Arrange the segments on four plates to
look like stars. Coat them with the sysrup and decorate with the
julienned zests. ALTERNATIVELY: Serve the oranges in a fruit dish,
with a selection of some other fruit desserts.
