Title: PEANUT SHRIMP CHILI
Categories: Shrimp, Chili, Shrimpchili
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Onion, chopped fine
2 tb Peanut oil
1/2 ts Dried oregano
1/2 ts Ground ginger
2 lb Cleaned shrimp
1/4 c  Water
1 c  Cooked white kidney beans
1/4 c  Peanut butter
3    Minced cloves of garlic
1 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Dried dill
2 tb Chili powder
1 c  Clam juice
2 ts Tomato paste
-salt and pepper to taste
Cook onion in oil until soft and translucent; add the minced garlic
and cook, stirring all the while, for about a minute. Don't let the
garlic burn. Add cumin, dill, oregano, ginger and chili powder and
cook, stirring all the while, for about 2 minutes more.  Add the
shrimp and then quickly add the clam juice, water and tomato paste (I
mix them together as part of the prep, then add them to the pot).
Quickly stir in the beans, season to taste with salt and pepper (I
use no salt and a "pepper melange" of green, pink, white and black
peppercorns). Increase the heat and, as soon as the mixture starts to
boil, remove from heat, whisk in the peanut butter, adjust seasoning,
and serve over rice.
