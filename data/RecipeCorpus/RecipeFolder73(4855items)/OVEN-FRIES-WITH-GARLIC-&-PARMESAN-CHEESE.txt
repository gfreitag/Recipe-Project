1.  Peel potatoes, quarter lengthwise and place in cold water to
cover. Drain potatoes and blot dry with paper towels.

2.  Heat oil in shallow roasting pan over medium high heat. When hot,
add potatoes in single layer without crowding them too much. Brown,
turn and brown other sides, about 9 minutes total. Remove from heat.
Can be made several hours in advance up to this point and kept at
room temperature.

3.  To finish, heat oven to 425 degrees; set rack in middle of oven.
Place potatoes in pan in hot oven. Bake until tender, about 25
minutes. Use tongs to turn once midway. Just before removing, toss
with garlic, red pepper and cheese.  Return to oven for a few minutes
until cheese melts and garlic is fragrant.
