Title: ONION PANCAKES (CHOAN YAO BANG)
Categories: Chinese, Dim sum
Yield: 6 Servings
2/3 c  Flour
1/4 c  Lukewarm water
2    Green onion stalks, chopped
3 tb Dehydrated onion flakes
3    Bacon strips, cook & crumble
Lard
Salt
Sesame seeds
2 tb Oil, (2-3 T)
PREPARATION: Soak dry onion for 20 minutes. Discard water. Mix with
chopped green onions and crumbled bacon. TO MAKE PANCAKES: Mix flour
with water and knead for 5 minutes. Separate into 6 parts and roll
each into a 4 inch round flat dough. Spread a thin layer of lard on
the dough and sprinkle salt and 1 tbsp. filling. Roll up jelly roll
style, pull lightly on both ends to stretch slightly lengthwise. Now
coil it around in a snake like fashion and tuck ends under. Roll out
again to 4 inch rounds. Spread some sesame seeds on the bottom as you
roll, so they adhere to the pancake. COOKING: Heat skillet on medium
heat, add 1 tsp. oil. Brown slowly on both sides until golden. Repeat
with rest of the pancakes, adding a little oil as needed. Serve while
hot. DO AHEAD NOTES: Cook ahead and refrigerate or freeze. If frozen,
thaw out first. Then reheat single layer for 5 minutes in preheated
400 degrees oven or in skillet until thoroughly heated. Great hors
d'oeuvres! COMMENTS: Do not brown bacon until crisp. Cook until firm
only. (If too crisp, the flavor is cooked out.) Finely mince bacon.
Pancakes are good either as luncheon side dishes (serving them whole)
or as hors d'oeuvres (cutting each pancake into quarters). The
traditional version does not include bacon, but Ms. Yee happens to
like the bacon taste. Source: "Dim Sum" by Rhoda Fong Yee. Formatted
