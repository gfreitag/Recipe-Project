Title: OVERNIGHT WHOLE GRAIN CEREAL
Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Part mixed whole grains
(e g. wheat berries, oats,
Buckwheat, hulled barley,
Rye, millet, etc.)
3    Parts water
1/3    Part raisins (optional)
Boil water Add grains [and raisins, if using them] Stir Bring to boil
again Turn off heat Cover pot Leave overnight as is [or in a warm
oven]

(NOTE: I usually add raisins to already cooked cereal because I like
the texture. They turn out differently if they are added in the
cooking stage. They plump up and are really soft, which is nice
sometimes. I guess other types of dried fruit might work too.)

You can reheat this in the morning or eat it at room temp. Suggested
toppings included any of the following:

milk-type stuff molasses fruit sesame salt maple syrup

One variation the cookbook suggests is toasting and then grinding the
grains in a hand grinder before cooking. Apparently, this makes the
grains more nutty tasting.

years ago.
