Had an outstanding weekend at sales this time, including some neat
cookbooks++a Danish one, a Mexican one, an Appalachian one, along
with a small Mongolian Firepot and about two grand worth of software
that I got for thirty bucks.  Things like Ventura publisher and a
complete LAN setup including the hardware.  The guy having the sale
said "Thank God someone came along who knows what this stuff is!" I
was just thankful I got there first!.  No ridged skillet yet and I
still haven't found a good wok for Alison, but the sales are really
picking up again now that spring is here.

Stumbled across this recipe in one of the books and thought it might
be of at least passing to ya...  ;-} Maybe make it with some nice
fresh salmon?

Season fish with salt, pepper, and tarragon leaves and soak in lime
juice for a few minutes.  Set the oven at 375F and bake fish in
buttered baking dish until it flakes easily when pierced with a fork,
about 25 minutes.

While fish is baking, combine tomatoes, parsley, avocado, garlic,
minced onion, oil chili powder, salt and pepper to taste. (We suggest
tasting the guacamole as the chili powder is added, so that you can
get just the degree of heat you desire.)

Spread the above mixture over the cool fish.  Garnish with black olive
rings and strips of sweet red pepper.

Makes 6 to 8 servings.
