Title: PAREVE KISHKA
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Matzoh meal
1 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 c  Farina
2 ea Large carrots, peeled
2 ea Stalks celery
1 ea Large onion
2 ea Large eggs
1/2 c  Cooking oil -OR-
1 x  1/2 cup melted "Nyafat"
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts White pepper
2 tb Paprika
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, blend
together the matzoh meal, flour and farina. Set aside. Dice the
carrots, celery and onion into a blender container.  Add the eggs,
oil, salt, pepper and paprika.  Blend until smooth. Combine the
vegetable mixture with the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl. Blend
well. Divide in half. Form the mixture into 2 rolls about 12 inches
long and place each on a piece of very lightly greased aluminum foil.
Wrap each roll in the foil securely. Place the rolls on a baking
sheet. Bake for 45 minutes. Serve hot. NOTE: "Nyafat" is a brand name
imitation schmaltz available in the kosher section of the
supermarket. For those unfamiliar with it, it's an onion-flavored
vegetable shortening and can be substituted for real schmaltz
(rendered chicken fat). The advantages are (1) lower cost, (2) no
cholesterol, (3) contains no animal products ("pareve").
