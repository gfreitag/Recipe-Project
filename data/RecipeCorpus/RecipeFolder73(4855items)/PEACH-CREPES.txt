Title: PEACH CREPES
Categories: Rosie's
Yield: 8 Servings
MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE CREPES----------------------------
1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1    Egg, lg
3 tb Amaretto-flavored nondairy
-creamer
1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
1 ts Pure vanilla extract
Light vegetable oil cooking
Spray
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FILLING---------------------------
2 c  Fresh orange juice
2 tb Orange liqueur
8    Peaches, peeled and thinly
-sliced
1 ts Honey
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Orange zest
Put the flour into a mixing bowl.  Make a well in the center of the
flour and add the egg.  While whisking, pour in the nondairy creamer
and then the skim milk. Continue to whisk until the batter is smooth
and free of lumps, then whisk in the nutmeg and vanilla.  Cover the
batter and set it aside for 30 minutes. Prehead an 8-inch nonstick
crepe pan or a small, heavy nonstick frying pan for about 1 minute
over medium-high heat. Spray it twice with the vegetable oil. Spoon
just enough batter into the pan to form a thin layer over the bottom,
about 3 tablespoons, and tilt the pan to spread the batter evenly.
Cook the crepe for 1 to 2 minutes, just until the edge is firm and
begins to separate from the bottom. Flip the crepe with a spatula and
cook for 1 to 2 minutes more on the other side, until golden brown.
Remove the crepe to a sheet of waxed paper. Continue the process,
stacking the cooked crepes on the waxed paper, until 8 crepes have
been made. For the filling, combine the orange juice, liqueur,
peaches and honey in a medium frying pan.  Cook for about 10 minutes,
until the liquid turns thick and syrupy. To assemble, lay a crepe on
an individual serving plate. Mound 1/3 cup of the peach slices on the
bottom half of each and flip the top half over. Spoon a tablespoon of
the peach syrup over each and dust with cinnamon and orange zest.
