Categories: Fish/shellf, Low fat, Low cal
Yield: 4 Servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS
1 1/2 lb Fresh tomatoes (about 3 med)
3 tb White onion; grated
1/8 ts Salt
1/4 c  Orange marmalade
2 tb Brandy
2 ts Whole coriander; crushed
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
pn Cayenne
1 1/4 lb Orange roughy fillets
Lemon wedges (1 per serving)
Cut the unpeeled tomatoes in half crosswise, squeeze out the seed
pockets, and cut out the stem ends.  Dice the tomatoes and place in a
saucepan with the onion and salt. Cook over medium heat, 5 minutes,
stirring occasionally.  Add the marmalade and brandy and continue to
cook, 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add the coriander, cinnamon,
and cayenne and cook 5 minutes longer, stirring frequently.

Meanwhile, rinse the fish.  Place it in a skillet large enough to
hold it in a single layer and add enough water to just cover the
fish. Remove the fish and set aside. Bring the water to a boil over
high heat, reduce heat to medium, and add the fish in a single layer.
Bring back to a simmer, cover, and poach 3 to 5 minutes, depending on
the thickness of the fish. Fish is done when mostly opaque but still
barely translucent at the very center.  Remove from the poaching
liquid, draining off as much water as possible.  Place on a platter
and drain again. Pour the hot tomato orange marmalade over the fish,
garnish with lemon wedges, and serve immediately.
