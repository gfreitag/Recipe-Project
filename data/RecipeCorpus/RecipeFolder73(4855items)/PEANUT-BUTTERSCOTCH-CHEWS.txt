Title: PEANUT BUTTERSCOTCH CHEWS
Categories: Candies
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Peanut Butter
6 oz Butterscotch Chips
4 c  To 8 c cereal (Corn Flakes,
-Wheatees, you name it)
Slowly melt the peanut butter and the Butterscotch chips until creamy.
Remove from heat and stir in cereal so that all pieces are as coated
as desired (If you want it sweeter use less cereal if you want to
stretch it out use more.)

NOTE: Do not use Cholesteral free peanut butter. In order for the
Chips to melt they need the oil of the peanut butter. I found this
out the hard way, but I made the best of a bad situation by making
buterscotch
