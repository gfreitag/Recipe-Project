1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Olive oil
2 ts Garlic -- minced
1/2 c  Straight sherry -- not dry

2 qt Boiling salted water
Preheat the oven to 400~. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with
cooking spray. Bake the cod fillets, uncovered, for 5 to 6 minutes,
only until the cod flakes easily. Remove from the oven immediately to
prevent overcooking. Whel cooled, break the fillets in half,
lengthwise, then break each half into approximately 1" pieces and set
aside. SAUCE-In a heavy non-aluminum 3-qt pot, melt the butter, add
the flour and cook on moderate heat for 3 minutes, stirring
constantly with a wire whisk. Do not allow the flour to brown. Add
the milk and salt and bring to just below the boiling point, whisking
constantly. Remove from the heat and keep warm (180~). Heat the olive
oil in a saute pan over medium heat until fragrant, then saute the
garlic only until white throughout. Add the sauteed garlic to the
warm bechamel sauce. Add the sherry to the pan in which the garlic
was sauteed, simmer strongly for 1 minute, then add it to the warmed
sauce. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce. Place the
bechamel/garlic/pasta/sherry mix back onto low heat for a few
minutes, then add the cooked cod, clams, langostinos or shrimp,
crabmeat and chopped parsley to the warm bechamel sauce and blend all
ingredients thoroughly. Serve immediately. Source: The Olive Garden.
