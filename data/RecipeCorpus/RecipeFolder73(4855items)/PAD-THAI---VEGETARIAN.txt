*Fish sauce is made from fermented salted fish.  It can be found in
Asian food stores and requires no refrigeration after opening.

In a covered pot, bring the water to a rolling boil. Blanch the mung
bean sprouts by placing them in a strainer or small colander and
dipping it into the boiling water for 30 seconds. Set aside to drain
well. When the water returns to a boil, stir in the rice noodles and
cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until tender but firm. Drain the cooked
noodles, rinse them under cool water, and set them aside to drain.

Prepare the remaining ingredients and have them near at hand before
you begin to stir-fry.  Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet. Add
the garlic and chile, swirl them in the oil for a moment, and stir in
the grated carrots.  Stir-fry for 1 minute.  Push the carrots to the
sides to make a hollow in the center. Pour the beaten eggs into the
center and quickly scramble them.  When the eggs have just set, pour
in the sauce mixture and stir everything together.  Add the drained
rice noodles and mung sprouts, and toss to distribute evenly. Stir in
the peanuts and scallions, and serve at once.
