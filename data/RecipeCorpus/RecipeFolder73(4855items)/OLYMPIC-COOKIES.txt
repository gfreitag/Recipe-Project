1/2 lb (2 sticks) unsalted butter,
-room temperature
1 ts Pure vanilla extract
3 c  Rolled oats
1 c  Plus 2 tbsp. Gold Medal all-
-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda

rubber spatula, and mix to combine.

ounce ice-cream scoop, scoop two balls, one on top of each other, for
each cookie. Place five cookies on each baking sheet, spacing them
three inches apart.  With damp hands, flatten each into a disc, about
3/4 inch thick and 2 3/4 inches wide. Bake for about 24 minutes,
rotating pans between shelves after 12 minutes.  Transfer to rack to
cool. Yield: 18 4 1/2 inch cookies. Typed in MMFormat by
