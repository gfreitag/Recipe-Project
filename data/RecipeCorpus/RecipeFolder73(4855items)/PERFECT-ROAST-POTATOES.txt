Title: PERFECT ROAST POTATOES
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 8 Servings
4 lb Potatoes, peeled
4 oz Lard or sunflower oil
1 tb Flour
1 ts Mustard powder
Coarse sea salt
Preheat oven to 200'C (400'F). If the potatoes are very large cut
them in half. Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil,
then add the potatoes and cook for
10    mins. Meanwhile, put the lard in a large roasting tin. Put
in the oven for 10 mins until the fat is sizzling hot. Drain the
potatoes and return to the pan. Cover the pan and shake vigorously to
roughen the outside of all the potatoes. Sprinkle the flour and
mustard over the potatoes and shake the pan again. Put potatoes in
the roasting tin, turning each quickly to coat in the hot fat. Bake
for approx. 1 hour or until crisp and golden on the outside. Sprinkle
with sea salt just before serving.
