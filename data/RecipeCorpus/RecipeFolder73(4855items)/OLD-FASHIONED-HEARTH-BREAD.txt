1 pk Active dry yeast
2 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Instant nonfat dry milk
-solids
1 tb Wheat germ
1 tb Butter or margarine
1 ts Salt
Makes 1 loaf

Combine 1/4 cup of the water, honey and yeast.  Stir to dissolve
yeast and let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, dry milk, wheat germ,
butter and salt into work bowl. Process until mixed, about 15 seconds.

Add yeast mixture to flour mixture.  Process until blended, about 10
seconds.

Turn on processor and very slowly drizzle just enough remaining water
through feed tube into flour mixture so dough forms a ball that
cleans the sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl
about 25 times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining water to
make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lightly greased surface.  Shape into ball and place in
lightly greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover loosely with
plastic wrap and let stand in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough.  Shape into smooth ball and place on greased cookie
sheet.  Roll or pat into circle about 6 inches in diameter. Cover
loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in warm place until almost
doubled, about 45 minutes.

Heat oven to 375 F.  Bake until golden and loaf sounds hollow when
tapped, about 25 - 30 minutes.

Remove from cookie sheet.  Cool on wire rack.
