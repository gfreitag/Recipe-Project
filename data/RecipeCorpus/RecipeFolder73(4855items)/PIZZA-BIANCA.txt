Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface.  Divide in half. Pat
each half into round.  Let stand 10 minutes.

Preheat oven to 475 F.  Roll each round out on lightly floured
surface into circle 1/8-inch thick.  Transfer to cake rack or any
flat perforated pan. Spread with sauce. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake on
rack until edges of pizzas are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Serve pizzas immediately.
