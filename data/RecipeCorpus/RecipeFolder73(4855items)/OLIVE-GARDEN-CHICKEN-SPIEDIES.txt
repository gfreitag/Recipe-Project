MARINADE-Add all ingredients except the chicken to a non-aluminum
mixing bowl and mix thoroughly until the sugar and salt are
completely dissolved. Pound the chicken breast between sheets of
waxed peper until an even thickness of 3/16" overall.  Cut the
chicken breast meat into 1" squares and add to the marinade, covering
completely. Allow to marinate for 2 hours, refrigerated. Remove from
the marinade after 2 hours and drain. SPIEDIES-Assemble in the
following order: red bell pepper, onion, chicken (folded into "C"
shape on the skewer), green bell pepper, onion, chicken, alternately,
finishing with a red pepper strip after the 4th piece of chicken on
each skewer. Spread the skewered items out on each skewer, so they
will cook quickly. Place the Spiedies on a grill or a griddle and
cook approximately 1 minute per side, turning 4 times. Adjust the
timing according to your equipment's heat output. Serve immediately,
4 per quest, with dipping sauce, about 1/4 c per serving. SAUCE-Mix
all ingredients together just until blended. Chill 1 to 2 hours to
blend flavors. Serve cold. Source: The Olive Garden.
