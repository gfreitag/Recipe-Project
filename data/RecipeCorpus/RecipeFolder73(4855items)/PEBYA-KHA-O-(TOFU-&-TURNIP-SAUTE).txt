Categories: Burma, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Chinese tofu cake
3 tb Corn OR peanut oil
1 sm Onion, sliced (1/4 cup)
1 sm Rutabaga, peeled, cut into
-1/4-inch-thick
Slices (2/3 cup)
1/4 c  Chopped ripe tomato, fresh
-or canned
1 ts Thin-sliced fresh hot green
-chili
2 ts Soy sauce
1/4 ts Ground cuminseed
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Water
1.  Cut the tofu into 5 rectangles about 1 inch wide, 2 inches long
and 1/4 inch thick.  Dry them well on paper towels.

2.  Heat a dry skillet for 1 minute, then add the oil (this prevents
the tofu fromn sticking).  Fry the tofu over moderate heat to a
light-brown on both sides. Remove and set aside. Remove all but 1
tablespoon oil.

3.  Brown the onion in the oil over moderate heat for 2 minutes. Add
the rutabaga slices and stir fry for 2 minutes. Add the tomato,
chili, soy sauce, cuminseed, and salt and stir fry for 1 minute. Add
the water, cover the skillet, and cook for 5 minutes.

4.  Add the tofu, stir for a moment, cover the skillet, and cook for 3
minutes more.

Serve warm with bread.  An excellent side dish for vegetarians.

Note:  Firm vegetables such as chayote and the white turnip with a
mauve top can also be used in this preparation. The contrast of the
browned tofu and the soft turnip is pleasant to the palate, and the
flavorings give it an unusual and distinctive character.
