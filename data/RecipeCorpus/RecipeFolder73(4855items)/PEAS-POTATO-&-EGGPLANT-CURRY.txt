Categories: Main dish, Indian, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lg Potatoes
1 md Eggplant
1 c  Frozen peas
2    Garlic cloves
1/4 lb Ginger
1    Dried hot chili, -=OR=-
1/4 ts Chili powder
1    Onion
1/2 ts Turmeric powder
2 tb Vegetable oil
Salt, to taste
Wash and cut potatoes in small pieces.  (Each potato cut into 16
sections is the ideal.)  Cut eggplant into thin slices, about 2 to 3
inches long. Put it in water.

With 2 tablespoons of water, blend the cloves of garlic, ginger, dried
chili or chili powder, and onion. Make it a thick mixture.

Put a cooking pot over a low heat.  Add oil.  Add turmeric powder and
blended spices.  When the spices become relatively thick, add
potatoes. Mix thoroughly and put the lid on the pot. Let it cook for
3 minutes.

Now add sliced eggplant.  Mix thoroughly.  Add 1/2 cup of water. Put
the lid on.  Cook for 8 minutes.  You may want to check the
vegetables to make sure that the bottom does not burn.

Add peas and salt.  Mix all vegetables and put the lid back on. Cook
for 4 to 9 minutes.  When the eggplant feels soft, turn off the heat.
Mix again.

Serve hot or warm.
