Title: PECAN CINNAMON BUNS
Categories: Breads, Desserts
Yield: 12 Servings
1/2 oz Yeast
1 tb Sugar
1 c  Lukewarm water
1 ts Salt
1 c  Milk
6 tb Oil
1/2 c  Sugar
3    Eggs
7 c  Flour
1    Brown sugar
1    Light karo syrup
1    Chopped walnuts or pecans
Put yeast and 1 tbl sugar and water in a large bowl. Set aside. Scald
the milk, take off heat.  Add oil, 1/2 cup sugar, salt and cool to
lukewarm.
In a separate bowl, mix eggs and milk mixture.  Slowly add flour.
Knead lightly, place in a lightly greased bowl and let rise until
double in size. Punch down, take about 1/3 of the dough and roll to
about 1/4" thick. Spread with the following...
Melted butter, sprinkle with white sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon.
Roll dough and cut about 1" thick.  Put in *Prepared Pans*
(directions to follow).  Cover and let rise until double in size.
Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes.  Let stand for about 1 minute, loosen
rolls from the sides of the pan and turn out on wax paper to cool.
(at least to cool enough so you can pick them up to eat cause they
are best when warm.)
***** Prepared pans:  Lightly grease bottom and sides of pan. Put a
thin layer of brown sugar on bottom, chopped walnuts or pecans also.
Lightly drizzle melted butter over the sugar and nuts, then lightly
drizzle white karo syrup over the mixture.  If you add too much brown
sugar, butter and syrup all the "sticky" will run off when cooling.
You have to experiment a little to see how much to add to your liking.
