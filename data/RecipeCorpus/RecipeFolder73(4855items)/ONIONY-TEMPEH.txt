Title: ONIONY TEMPEH
Categories:
Yield: 6 Servings
1 pk Tempeh
1/2    Onions; thinly sliced
1 ts Butter
1    Garlic cloves, crushed
1    Chili peppers
1/2 ts Sauce, soy
1 ts Sugar, brown
Dice tempeh and deep fry until crunchy.  Fry onion in butter until
limp; add garlic and chili pepper and saute briefly. Add fried tempeh
and stir around. Add sweet soy sauce and brown sugar. Keep stirring
the mixture. Tempeh is fermented soy beans and paste sold in
"bricks." The idea is to coat the tempeh with the sugary, spicy,
oniony, flavor...so you won't taste the tempeh. (G)
