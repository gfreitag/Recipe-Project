1 pk Active dry yeast
1 c  Warm water
1/2 ts Brown sugar

1 c  Rye flour
1/2 ts Salt
5 tb Extra-virgin olive oil

Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a small bowl.  Add sugar, stir and
set aside until yeast starts to bubble. Sift both flours and salt
into large bowl.  Make a well in the center of flour mixture and pour
in yeast and 2 tbsp. oil.  Stir to make stiff dough.  Knead on
floured surface until smooth, about 15 minutes. Wash and oil the bowl
with 1 tbsp. olive oil. Return dough ball to bowl and turn to coat
with oil. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk,
about 1 hour. In a small skillet, saute onion in 2 tbsp. olive oil
for 5 minutes over medium heat until soft. Cool. Punch dough down and
knead again on a well-floured surface. Work onions and whole olives
into dough as you knead. Oil a baking tray or 9-inch loaf pan. Shape
dough into a ball and place on prepared tray or in pan. Cover and let
rise again in a warm place for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Bake loaf for 1 hour, until lightly browned. Cool on wire rack.
