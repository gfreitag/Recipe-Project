Prepare frozen artichoke hearts according to package directions.
Recipe calls for 4 to 5 ounces total but only 2 ounces are needed for
the soft-cheese filling.

Make FILLING the day before. In a food processor fitted with a metal
blade, puree 2 ounces of artichokes and ricotta cheese until smooth.
In a bowl, combine the puree, mascarpone and parmesan, argula,
parsley and garlic. Mix well.  Refrigerate over night.

Select fresh herbs, one or a mixture:  parsley, basil, thyme,
marjoram, sage, chives

Cut 2" squares from the pasta.  Fill each square with 1/2 to 1
teaspoon of the filling.  Fold the pasta over to form a triangle. Use
water to hold edge. Place in a single layer on a rack until slightly
dry to the the touch (1 to 2 hours). The pasta will cook in 2 to 3
minutes.

Make the sauce.  In a large frying pan over low heat, melt the
butter. Add chopped artichoke hearts and saute until heated through,
about 1 minutes. Drain the pasta bfiefly in a colander and
immediately add it to the artichokes.  Raise the heat to high and
toss the pasta gently. Add the hearts and arugula and toss again
until mixed. Season and serve immediately. Serves 8 first or 4 main
courses.
