Title: OVERNIGHT HASHED BROWN POTATOE CASSEROLE
Categories: Vegetables, Casseroles
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Frozen hashed brown potatoes
1/4 lb Butter
1 pt Sour cream
1 cn Mushroom soup
8 oz Chedder cheese; shredded
1    Onion; grated
3/4 c  Milk* (optional)
Cut butter into potatoes.  Mix rest of ingred. together; pour over
top of potatoes.  Toss.  *1/4 - 3/4 c. milk can be used in place of
one-half of the sour cream. It will make a moister casserole, if
desired. Bake in a 13x9" pan @ 350 for 1/2 hr covered and an
additional 1/2 hr. uncovered. I have used Cheddar Cheese soup, but
reduce the butter as it will be greasy with both.  I also put
additional shredded cheese on top during the second half hour of
baking. Doubles well. Can be refrigerated overnight after mixing all
together. TSPN00B-LISA CRAWLEY
