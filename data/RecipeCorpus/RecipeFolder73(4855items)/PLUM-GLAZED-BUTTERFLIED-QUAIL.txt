Title: PLUM-GLAZED BUTTERFLIED QUAIL
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
12    Quail; thawed if frozen
2 tb Butter or Margarine
1/3 c  Plum Jam
1/4 ts Basil Leaves; dried
1 tb Red Wine Vinegar
Salt
Pepper
Rinse quail and pat dry. Cut through backbone of each bird with
poultry shears or a knife. Place quail, skin-side up, on a flat
surface and press down firmly, cracking bones slightly, until birds
lie flat. In a 2 to 3 cup pan, combine butter, jam, and basil; stir
over medium heat until jam melts. Blend in vinegar and set aside.

Place birds, skin-side up, on a grill 4-6" above a solid bed of hot
coals. Cook, turning occasionally, until skin is browned and breast
meat is still pink at bone, (cut to test) 8-10 minutes total. During
the last 5 minutes on the grill, baste with the jam mixture. Add salt
and pepper to taste.
