Title: PHYLLO~ EATING WELL'S LOW-FAT METHOD
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings  For appetizers with a lot of style but little fat, phyllo pastries
are a natural. The paper-thin sheets of phyllo dough can be rolled,
folded, shaped, seasoned, or filled in countless ways. In typical
phyllo recipes, however, the layers of dough are freely brushed with
melted butter; when baked, the butter keeps the thin sheets separate,
producing a flaky--and fat-saturated--result. We developed a
technique in which the leaves of phyllo are lightly coated with a
blend of egg white and olive oil. During baking, the egg whites
become crisp while the oil keeps the leaves separate. The low-fat
technique has an unexpected and welcome benefit: the pastries turn
out crisper and less oily than those made with pure fat, and filled
pastires don't become soggy.

Frozen phyllo (or filo or fillo) is available in most supermarkets;
it is also sold fresh in some Greek and Middle Eastern specialty
shops. One pound of dough averages 25 large sheets of pastry. Our
recipes were devloped for full-sized sheets, either 14 by 18 inches
or 12 by 17 inches. These appetizers work beautifully for
entertaining because they can be prepared in advance and refrigerated
or frozen.

TIPS:

Phyllo Dough is easy and fun to work with as long as it doesn't get
soggy or dried out. To avoid these potential hazards:

Thaw frozen phyllo in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or
overnight; this will prevent damp spots that could cause the sheets of
dough to stick together.

Remove phyllo from refrigerator, and leave unopened at room
temperature for 1 to 2 hours.

Clear a large work surface before removing phyllo from the box.

Carefully unroll sheets onto a dry surface.

Keep sheets of phyllo covered with plastic wrap or wax paper while
you work; if the dough is left uncovered for even a short period of
time, it dries out and breaks into flakes.

Work quickly and with a gentle hand.
