-Taste
10 tb Butter
3 tb Dijon Mustard
1 c  Ground Pecans
2 tb Vegetable Oil (Preferably

2/3 c  Sour Cream
Place halved chicken breasts between two sheets of waxed paper and
pound with a kitchen mallet or heavy skillet to approximately 1/4"
thickness. Sprinkle lightly with salt and lemon pepper. In a small
saucepan over medium heat, melt 6 tbsp (90 ml) butter. Remove from
heat and whisk or beat in 2 tbsp (30 ml) mustard. Dip chicken pieces
in mustard mixture the coat with ground pecans. Set aside. In frying
pan heat oil and remaining butter over medium heat. When hot, add
chicken breasts and cook 3 minutes per side until lightly browned (do
this in batches, if necessary, to avoid crowding the pan). Remove
breasts when they are browned; keep warm. Discard excess fat and any
bits of pecans remaining in the pan. Return frying pan to medium heat
and stir in sour cream, stirring up browned bits from the bottom of
the pan. Whisk in remaining mustard; add salt and lemon pepper to
taste. Remove from heat. To serve, spoon a dollop of sauce onto the
centre of each heated dinner plate and place chicken breast on top.
Serve with a steamed vegetable to contrast with the flavor and the
texture of the chicken.

Yield: 4 Servings Notes: I usually cut oil and butter amounts in
half, it still comes out fine. I also serve this on top of rice, the
sauce blends well with it. This recipe was the grand prize recipe in
the Edmonton Journal Readers Favorite Recipes 1990-91 Cookbook.  It
has become my personal favorite chicken recipe.
