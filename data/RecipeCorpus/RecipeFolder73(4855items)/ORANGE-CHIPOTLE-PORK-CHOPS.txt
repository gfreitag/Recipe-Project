2    Pork chops 3/4" thick Smoked
-if possible
1/2 c  Orange Juice
2    Chipotles in Adobo (canned)

* Chipotle chiles are a type of smoked Jalapeno typical of Mexico.
They can be found widely as far as I understand. If you cannot find
them canned in adobo , you can use dry ones and reconstitute them,
though I make the dish with the canned ones.

** This dish requires a Flambe, so if you cannot Flambe (or are
afraid to do so), you can always take the orange liqueur and add it
to the marinade before you reduce it though the result is not the
same.

Directions:

In a blender or food processor, combine Chipotles, salt and Orange
Juice. Place in a shallow dish together with pork chops and marinade
in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Take chops out of marinade.
Reserve Marinade. Put marinade in in a small saucepan and reduce
until 1/3 of the liquid remains. In a frying pan, place pork chops
and cook in medium-high heat until cooked through. Take chops out of
the pan, and drain any excess oil. Put pan on high heat and cook
until no liquid remains and a glaze is formed on pan. Take pan away
from the heat and put the pork chops back on the pan. Add the 1/4 cup
Orange Liqueur and Flambe. When the flames die out take chops out of
the pan and keep warm. Put the pan back on the stove and add the
reduced marinade. Heat until starting to boil. Put the chops in a
serving platter and pour some sauce on top. Enjoy. It should be sweet
and spicy.
