Title: PARADIZET
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Recipe
4    Egg yolks
4    Egg whites
5 ts Sugar
1/2 qt Milk
5 lg Cookies (about)
Beat egg yolks with 4 tablespoons sugar.  Beat the egg whites. Boil
the milk with 1 tablespoon sugar.  When the milk is boiling, add the
beaten egg to the boiling milk, spoon by spoon, letting it boil for a
couple of minutes and removing it, spoon by spoon and drop into a
bowl in which you previously place five crunched cookies. Continue
this until there are no more egg whites left. Then pour the remaining
milk over the beaten egg yolks, stirring over a hot plate until it
stiffens (like pudding). When it is thick, pourit over the egg whites
and cookies. Cool in refrigerator and serve cold.
