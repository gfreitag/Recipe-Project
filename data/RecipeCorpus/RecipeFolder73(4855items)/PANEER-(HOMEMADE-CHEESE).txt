Categories: Indian, Cheese
Yield: 6 Servings
1 ga Milk
1 c  Vinegar

In a pot, bring the milk to a boil, but do not let it scorch. Add the
vinegar. Let the mixture separate completely, a few seconds. Strain
the mixture through a cheesecloth. Twist the cheesecloth to squeeze
out the liquid.  Set the cloth on a flat surface and weigh down with
a large saucepan filled with water to the top. Let sit until all the
liquid is gone and a firm cake is formed, 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Cut the
cake into 1-inch cubes.

In a pan, lightly saute the cubes in vegetable oil. Makes enough for 2
recipes.

NOTE:  The unused portion may be wrapped tightly in foil and plastic
and frozen.  Thaw before using.
