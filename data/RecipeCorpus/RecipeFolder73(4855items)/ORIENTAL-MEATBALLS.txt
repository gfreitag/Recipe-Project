Title: ORIENTAL MEATBALLS
Categories: Chinese, Pork
Yield: 6 Servings
1/2 c  Uncooked short grain rice
3/4 lb Lean ground pork
2    Water chestnuts
3 ts Dried shrimp, soaked/minced
1    Stalk green onion, minced
1/2 ts Minced ginger
2 tb Chopped carrot
2 ts Soya sauce
4 ts Cornstarch
1    Egg white

Soak rice in warm water for 1-1/2 to 2 hours.  Drain well and set
aside. Mix pork with the remaining ingredients in a bowl. Form into
14 meat balls: take a fistful of the mixture and squeeze out a
meatball between your thumb and index finger.  Use a wet soup spoon
to remove meatballs from your fist. Roll the meatballs in the soaked
rice until evenly coated. Gently press rice into meatballs.  Steam
over high heat for 25-30 minutes. Add more water to the steamer if
necessary. Serve with soya sauce, if desired.

Pearls can be kept in the refrigerator and resteamed.
