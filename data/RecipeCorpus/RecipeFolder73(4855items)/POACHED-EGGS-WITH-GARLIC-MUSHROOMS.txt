Nothing is more delicious than mushrooms cooked in butter with garlic
and parsley - so simple, yet unbeatable. As a topping for poached
eggs they come into their own as a wonderful light meal at any time
of the year.

SautÂ‚ the mushrooms in the butter or sunflower margarine until lightly
cooked, then stir in the garlic and parsley and cook gently for a
further 2-3 minutes. Season with a little salt and pepper and add the
stock. Heat through. Place the eggs in separate ramekin dishes and
spoon the mushroom mixture over the top. Serve at once with warm
granary bread and a crisp salad.
