Title: PASTA WITH CREOLE SAUCE
Categories: Main dish, Pasta, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
16 oz Red kidney beans, canned
Drained and rinsed
2 ea Bay leaves
1 1/2 c  Onions, diced
1/3 c  Dry red wine
1/2 c  Green bell pepper, thinly
Sliced
2 c  Canned tomato puree
1 tb Garlic, minced
1 tb Oregano, dried
1 tb Thyme, dried
1/8 ts Cayenne
1 ts Rice wine vinegar
8 oz Pasta
Salt & pepper to taste
Prepare the pasta per directions on the package. In a medium sauce
pan, braise the onions in the red wine over medium high heat. When
onions are soft, add the green pepper. Before peppers are completely
softened, add the tomatoes, garlic, oregano, thyme, and two bay
leaves.

Stew all this together for 20 to 25 minutes.

Add kidney beans, cayenne, and the rice wine vinegar. Add salt and
pepper to taste.  Stir well and allow to heat through. Serve sauce
over pasta or rice.

NOTES: I did not braise onions but sauteed them with the garlic in a
little olive oil.  I did not have puree so I used 16 oz can of diced
tomatoes processed in a food processor and added an 8 oz can of
tomato sauce. I brought the sauce to a boil, lowered heat and cooked
for about 1 1/2 hours.
