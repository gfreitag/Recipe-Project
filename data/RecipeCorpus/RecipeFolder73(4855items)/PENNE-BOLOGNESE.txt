Categories: Italian, Low-cal, Easy
Yield: 4 Servings
2 ts Olive oil
1    Onion, minced
1    Carrot, minced
1    Celery rib, minced
1/2 lb Ground beef, lean
1/2 c  White wine, dry
1/3 c  Tomato paste
1 2/3 c  Milk
3/4 ts Slat
1/2 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Oregano
12 oz Penne pasta
1/4 c  Parsley, chopped
3 tb Parmesan cheese
In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil until hot but not smoking
over medium heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until
softened about 5 minutes. Stir in the carrot, celery, and 1/3 cup of
water and cook until the vegetables are tender and the liquid has
evaporated about 5 minutes longer. Stir in the ground beef and cook
until no longer pink about 4 minutes. Add the wine and cook until the
liquid has evaporated about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, 2/3
cup of milk, the salt, pepper and oregano, reduce to a simmer and
cook, stirring frequently, until the milk has been absorbed. Continue
to cook until the sauce is thick and creamy, gradually adding the
remaining 1 cup milk until all has been absorbed about 20 minutes
longer. Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling water
until just tender. Drain well. Transfer the sauce to a large bowl.
Add the pasta, parsely, if desired and the Parmesan and toss to
combine. Spoon the Penne Bolognese into 4 serving bowls. Suggested
accompaniments: Shredded Belgian endive with cooked frown artichoke
hearts tossed with a nonfat Italian dressing.
