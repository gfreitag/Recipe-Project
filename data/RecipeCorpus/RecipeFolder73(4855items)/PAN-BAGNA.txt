Recipe by: Craig Gardiner KNHT09A *NOTE: This must be made a day
ahead of serving.
In a large bowl, finely chop tomatoes, scallions, red onions,
peppers, olives, capers, pickles, garlic and anchovies. Season the
mixture with paprika and salt and pepper to taste. Blend in red wine
vinegar and olive oil.
Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Split a long, narrow loaf of French bread in half lengthwise as
equally as possible.  Carefully pull out the soft bread from the
center, but leave a crust wall at least 1/2 inch thick. Process the
soft bread in the food processor until finely chopped. Add the bread
crumbs to the vegetable mixture with 2 tablespoons more olive oil.
Let rest 20 minutes, then taste again and adjust seasoning, adding
more oil if it seems dry.
Stuff loaf with vegetable/bread mixture, so that all interior
spaces are filled but so that loaf still closes tightly. Tie with
string to hold everything in place, wrap in foil and refrigerate for
at least 24 hours.
Slice loaf into 1-inch slices and serve very cold, 2 or 3 slices
per person.  This is eaten with a knife and fork. This is also very
good made in small, individual loaves.

little more oil.
