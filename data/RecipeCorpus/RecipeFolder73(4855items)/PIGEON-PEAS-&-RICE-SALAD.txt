* A combination of garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, yellow mustard,
paprika, cumin and crushed bay leaf may be used in place of purchased
Caribbean spice blend. Pick over and rinse peas well. In a saucepan
over medium-high heat, bring peas, 3 cups water, garlic and thyme
sprigs to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and let simmer for 45 minutes,
adding 1/2 teaspoon salt towards the very end of cooking time. Drain
peas and remove thyme and garlic. Refrigerate until well chilled.
Meanwhile, cook rice in a saucepan containing 3 cups of boiling water
and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat, cover, and let cook for 45
minutes or until water is absorbed. Let rice cool. In a large bowl,
gently mix together chilled peas, cooled rice, celery, red pepper,
green onions and tomato. In a container with a tight-fitting lid,
place lemon juice, olive oil, honey, salt, pepper, thyme and
Caribbean spice blend; shake well. Pour dressing over salad, tossing
gently to coat.  Chill salad until ready to serve.
