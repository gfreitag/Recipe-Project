*Use Basic Recipe *Use Graham Cracker Crust found under Crust
Variations.

Candy canes, a seasonal favorite, add yummy flavor as well as festive
color to our delectable peppermint cheesecake. We think it works
especially well with our graham cracker crust.

Add 1 tsp peppermint extract to basic recipe with vanilla. Reserve 1
cup batter.  Pour remaining into prepared pan. Add 1/2 cup coarsely
chopped hard peppermint candies and 1-2 drops red food coloring to
reserved batter; swirl into batter in pan.  Bake as directed. Garnish
chilled cake just before serving with crushed peppermint candies, if
desired.
