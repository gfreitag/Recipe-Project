Title: PANCAKES/GUEST CHEF 1H16
Categories: Brunch
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1 ts Baking powder
1 ea Egg
1 1/2 tb Vegetable oil
5/8 c  Milk (we use low-fat)
SIFT THE DRY INGREDIENTS together into a bowl. Combine the egg, oil
and milk together in another bowl, then stir them into the dry
ingredients until batter is just smooth. Lightly grease a large
skillet or griddle. When hot, ladle the batter onto the griddle.
(Usually, 3 pancakes fit in a large skillet.) Adjust heat to
medium-high. When bubbles appear on the surface of the pancake,
usually after 2 to 3 minutes, lift with a spatula to see that the
underside is browned. Turn and cook the 2d side until browned, about
1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Joanna Pruess GUEST CHEF (EXPT46B)
