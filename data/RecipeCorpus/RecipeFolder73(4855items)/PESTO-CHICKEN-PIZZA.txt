Recipe by: hunt@austin.metrowerks.com (Eric Hunt) Marinate chicken
breast in your favorite Italian-style dressing for several hours.
Grill outside until 3/4 done or bake in a 350deg oven for 15 minutes.

Make sure 1/2 c sundried tomatoes are in a 1-c container. Fill
container to top with boiling water, set aside for 10-15 minutes.

Chop chicken into bite-sized pieces. Cover and set aside.

When sundrieds have reconstituted, chop coarsely (at least chop each
tomato in half, depending on how much tomato you can handle in one
bite)

Prepare pizza dough. Spread with a decent amount (not light, not
heavy) of pesto to 1/3 inch from edge of crust. You may want to
initially brush entir surface of dough liberally with olive oil,
depending on your taste.

Strategically place chopped chicken and sundried tomatoes over
surface of pesto. Sprinkle half of the mushrooms on top of all this.

Cover with cheese.

Sprinkle remaining mushrooms on surface of cheese.

Bake at 375 until crust is golden and cheese is bubbly and hinting at
turni golden.

Do not initially overbake chicken, or you will have bite-sized pieces
of leather on your pizza. I know, I got "gourmet" pizza last night
suffering f this affliction.
