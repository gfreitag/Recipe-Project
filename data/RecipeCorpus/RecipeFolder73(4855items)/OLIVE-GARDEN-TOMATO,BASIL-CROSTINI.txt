2    6" Boboli bread shells or --
Similar Italian flat

10 ml Garlic
2 tb Fresh parmesan -- grated
1 1/2 c  TOMATO/BASIL TOPPING
1 1/2 c  Roma tomatoes; seed --
Diced
1 tb Fresh basil -- chopped
1 tb Extra virgin olive oil
1/4 ts Salt
Preheat oven to 400~. GARLIC-OIL-Let 1 clove garlic soak in 2 tb
olive oil for 1 hour before using. Line a sheet pan or cookie sheet
with foil. Dribble 2 tb garlic oil over Boboli, sprinkle with cheese
and bake for 4 to 5 minutes, until hot, but not crisped or dried. Cut
the Boboli into 6 wedges or 2x2" squares. Remove to a serving plate
and cover, generously, with a cold tomato/basil topping, serve
immediately. TOPPING-Blend all ingredients thoroughly and refrigerate
for 2 hours before serving. Just prior to serving, drain in a
colander or strainer to eliminate excess liquid. (My Note: I would
prefer minced garlic mixed with the olive oil). Source: The Olive
