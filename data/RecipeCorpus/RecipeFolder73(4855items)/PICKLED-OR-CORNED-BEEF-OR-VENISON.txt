It is best to cut the meat into 4-6 lb  pieces.  Have a barrel ready
and spread a layer of Salt on the bottom. Rub ea ch piece of the meat
with a mixture of Salt and Pepper and pack down in layers, covering
ea ch with a layer of Salt.  The top layer should be of Salt. Let
stand overnight. In the morning pour on the brine made by mixing all
of the ingredi- ents together, using 1 recipe for ea ch 25 lb s of
meat. (Dissolve the ingredients in the 2 gallons of Water stirring
until the Salt is dissolved.
Test with an Egg; if it floats, fine, if not, add more Salt.) Pour
over the packed Salted meat and if necessary pour on more Water to
cover the meat.
Invert a dish over it and put a heavy weight on it, to be sure that
the meat will not float.  It may be used in 2-3 weeks. For 100 lb s
of meat double all of the ingredients.
