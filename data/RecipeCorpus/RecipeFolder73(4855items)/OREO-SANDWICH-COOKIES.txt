Title: OREO SANDWICH COOKIES
Categories: Ew text imp
Yield: 1 Servings
Cookie  wafers:
1    Box duncan hines dark fudge
1/3 c  Water
2 tb Shortening
-----CREME FILLING------
3 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
1/2 tb Granulated sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Shortening(no substitution)
3 tb Hot water
Preheat oven to 325F.  Blend all ingredients; then knead with your
hands until it is pliable like dough. Form dough into 3/4 inch balls
and press flat, 1/2 inch apart on greased cookie sheets. Bottom of a
glass works nice for this.  Bake 4 to 6 minutes or until cookies are
crunchy. I should think you could refrigerate the dough in cylinder
shaped rolls for a couple of hours and slice 1/8 inch thick, as well.
Let cookies cool on sheets. Combine filling ingredients and mix well.
Form into balls about 1/2 to 3/4 inch in diameter (this is a
preference thing in the U.S. and part of the great Oreo cookie
debate!), again using your hands. Sandwich one filling in the center
of two cookies and carefully press down until the filling spreads
almost to the edge. Makes 2 dozen cookies (4 dozen wafers)
