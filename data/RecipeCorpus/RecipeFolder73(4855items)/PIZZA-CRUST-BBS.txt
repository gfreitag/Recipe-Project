Title: PIZZA CRUST-BBS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Crust
4 1/2 c  Flour (high gluten
-recommended)
1 pk Dry yeast
1 ts Salt
2 c  Warm water
2 tb Vegetable or olive oil
Mix 2 cups of the flour, the yeast and salt. Add the water and oil,
and mix thoroughly. Slowly add the remaining flour until the dough
can be worked by hand. Knead thoroughly. Allow to rise for 30 minutes.

After the rising time, roll out the dough to fit whatever pizza pan or
baking dish you prefer. Top as desired, then bake completed pizza for
12 to 14 minutes at 475 B0 F, testing for doneness after 10 minutes.

Additional note: Since I originally found this recipe, I've learned
that a pizza stone is by far the best way to bake a pizza at home.
Follow the directions that accompany the stone, but typically you
need to preheat both the oven and the stone (i.e., put the stone in
the oven in its final position while preheating the oven) for at
least 20 minutes before placing the pizza in the oven to bake. The
crust should come out just great!
