Categories: Pork
Yield: 8 Servings
1 tb Butter
1    Onion; chopped
1/2 lb Ground lean pork
1/2 lb Ground pork fat
1/2 lb Ground veal
1/2 lb Pork or chicken liver, finel
-y chopped
2    Cloves garlic, peeled
Pinch of ground cloves
1/2 ts Ground allspice
Pinch of ground nutmeg
2    Eggs; beaten to mix
2 tb Brandy

1/2 lb Bacon slices
Melt butter in a small saute pan and cook onion over low heat until
soft but not brown, 10-15 minutes. Leave to cool. In a food
processor, puree the pork, pork fat, veal, pork or chicken liver,
garlic, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, eggs,  cooked onion, brandy, salt
and pepper. Divide the mixture in half if it does not all fit
comfortably in the machine. Saute a small piece of mixture and taste
for seasoning. It should be highly seasoned. If not, add more salt
and pepper. Set oven at 350F. Line the sides and base of a 1-quart
terrine mold with bacon, reserving 2 slices. Pack pork mixture in the
mold and smooth the top. Cut remaining bacon in thin strips and
arrange in a lattice on top of the pate. Cook the pate, uncovered,
ion a water bath until done when  tested with a skewer, 1.1/4 to
1.1/2 hours. Let pate cool to  tepid.  Insert a board that fits
inside the rim of the terrine. Distribute weights on top and chill.
Serve pate from the mold, and cut in slices at the table. The pate
should be made at least 48 hours ahead so that the  flavours mellow.
It can be kept up to 5 days in the refrigerator. Variations:  Pate de
porc solgnote (Pork pate with Hazelnuts) Add 1 cup toasted peeled
hazelnuts to the pork mixture. Pate de Pork Marbree (Marbled Pork
Pate)  Roll each chicken liver in very thinly sliced pork fat or fat
bacon. Make pate mixture without livers. Pack half of the mixture
into the mold and place livers down the center. Cover with remaining
mixture and bake. When sliced, the pate is marbled with liver
outlined in fat. Source: Classic french Cooking
