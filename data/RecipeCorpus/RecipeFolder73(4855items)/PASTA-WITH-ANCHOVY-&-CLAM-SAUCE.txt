If salted whole anchovies are used, wash them in cold running water to
remove most of the external salt and any tiny scales that may be
present. Use the fingers to pull the fillets from the bone. Discard
the bones.
Set the fillets aside.  Open the clams or have them opened and
reserve both the clams and 1 cup of clam juice. Finely chop the clams
and set aside.  Heat the oil and butter in a skillet. Add the garlic
and shallots and cook until light brown.  Add the anchovies and stir
until they dissolve.  Add the parsley, rosemary, reserved clam juice
and white wine and bring to a boil.  Add pepper and a tiny bit of
salt and simmer 15 minutes.  Add the chopped clams and cook 5
minutes. Serve piping hot over the freshly cooked pasta. Serve red
pepper flakes on the side, if desired, but no cheese.
