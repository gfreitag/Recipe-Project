Title: PERSIMMON FUDGE
Categories: Candies, Fruit
Yield: 10 Dozen
6 c  Sugar
2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Cream
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
1 1/4 c  Persimmon pulp (4-5 fruits)
1/2 c  Unsalted butter
1 c  Chopped fresh dates
2 c  Finely chopped nuts
In a large, heavy pot, mix sugar, milk, cream, corn syrup, and
persimmon pulp. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, for 45
minutes to 1 hour, or until mixture reaches the soft-ball stage
(235-240'F). Meanwhile, butter a 9x13-inch baking pan.

When fudge is the proper temperature, remove from heat and cool in
the pan until barely warm. Using a wooden spoon, beat in the butter.
When mixture thickens and butter is absorbed, add dates.

Spread fudge in the prepared pan. When completely cool, cut into small
squares. (If desired, squares may be rolled into balls and then
rolled in chopped nuts.) Chill 1 day. May freeze 3 weeks.

NOTE: To prepare persimmons, scoop soft persimmon pulp out of skins,
discarding seeds and leaves. Puree in a food processor or blender.

How to chop dates: Chop with a chef's knife (with a blade 6 to 8
inches long) dusted with powdered sugar to keep dates from sticking.
Or cut dates with scissors.
