Title: PALM BEACH BROWNIES
Categories: Florida, Nuts, Bar cookies
Yield: 32 Servings
8 oz Unsweetened chocolate
2    Sticks Unsalted butter
2 c  Walnuts, be generous
5 lg Eggs
2 ts Pure vanilla extract
1/2 ts Almond extract
1/4 ts Salt
1 tb Plus 1 teaspoon powdered
-instant Expresso
3 3/4 c  Sugar
1 2/3 c  Unbleached flour -- sifted
Adjust an oven rack one-third up from the bottom and preheat oven to
425 degrees.  Line a 9x11x2-inch pan with foil. Brush well with
melted butter. Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a large
double boiler over hot water on moderate heat or in a small, heavy
saucepan on low heat, stirring occasionally. When combined, remove
from heat and set aside. Break the walnuts into pieces if necessary,
trying to keep them fairly large. In the large bowl of an electric
mixer, beat the eggs with the vanilla and almond extracts, salt,
expresso and sugar at high speed for 10 minutes. On low speed, add
the chocolate mixture and beat only until mixed. Remove the bowl from
the mixer and stir in the nuts. Pour the batter into the prepared
pan. Bake for 35 minutes, reversing the pan from front to back once
to insure even baking.  At the end of 35 minutes, the cake will have
a firm crust, but when tested with a toothpick will appear
underbaked. Do not be concerned, it is done.  Remove the pan from the
oven and let stand until cool. Invert the brownies onto a cookie
sheet and remove the foil. Cover with length of waxed paper and
another cookie sheet, invert again. This cake MUST be covered and
refrigerated for a few hours or overnight before it is cut into bars.

Makes 32 JUMBO brownies.
