Title: PEANUT BUTTER CEREAL SQUARES
Categories: Snacks, Cereal box, Candy bars
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Peanut butter
1 c  Corn syrup
7 c  Cereal (mixture: Cheerios,
-Flakes, Krispies)
1 c  Coconut
1 c  Chocolate chips or M&M's
Pecans (opt)
Place cereals, coconut, chocolate chips, nuts in large bowl and mix
together. Put sugar and corn syrup in saucepan and cook until sugar is
dissolved add peanut butter stirring constantly so peanut butter
doesn't scorch. Remove from heat and pour over cereal mixture. Mix
together well and pat into large buttered (Pammed) jelly roll pan or
two 9X13 pans. Let cool and cut into squares. This is good with most
any cereal except once she put in some Froot Loops and I wasn't so
sure about them but of course it got eaten. One other thing she
always keeps around to snack on is a bowl of salted peanuts and
raisins.
