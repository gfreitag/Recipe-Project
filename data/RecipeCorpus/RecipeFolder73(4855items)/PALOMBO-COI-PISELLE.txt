This is a loose interpretation of a favorite Roman dish. Palombo is
the Italian name for a small shark related to leopard shark,
typically cooked and served with peas. This recipe makes just enough
sauce to moisten the fish; if you want to serve it over couscous, add
another cup or so of tomato juice.

Combine the oil and onion in a large skillet and cook over medium
heat just until the onion begins to color. Add the tomatoes, fresh
peas, salt and pepper and cook until the tomatoes release their
juice, about 5 minutes. (Wait to add thawed frozen peas until you add
the shark.)

Season the shark pieces with a little more salt and pepper and lay
them in among the vegetables. Cover and cook until the shark is
tender, 6 to 8 minutes depending on thickness. Transfer the fish to
warm plates, stir the mint into the skillet, correct the seasoning,
and spoon the sauce and peas over and around the fish.
