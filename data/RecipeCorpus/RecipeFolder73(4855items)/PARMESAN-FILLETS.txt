1 c  Mayonnaise

Combine the mayonnaise with the chives.  Fold 1/2 to 3/4 of the
beaten egg whites into the mixture to lighten the mayonnaise being
careful not to put in too much or the mixture will become loose.

Rinse the fillets in salted water and pat dry.  Place them on an
elevated rack in a large greased baking dish. Cover the fillets
evenly with the mayonnaise mixture; then sprinkle with Parmesan and
parsley. Bake in a preheated oven (425) for about 5 minutes or until
the topping is puffy. Finish the fillets by broiling until the
topping becomes a golden brown.

Garnish with lemon slices and serve with noodles accompanied by crisp
fresh leaf spinach cooked in butter and seasoned with a dusting of
nutmeg.

Serves 6.
