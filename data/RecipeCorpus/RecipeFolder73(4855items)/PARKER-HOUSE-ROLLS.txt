Title: PARKER HOUSE ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
1/2 pk Dry yeast
1 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Warm water
3/4 c  Milk; scalded
-and cooled to lukewarm
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Unsalted butter; melted
3 c  All-purpose flour, (approx.)
COMBINE YEAST, 1/2 the sugar, and the water in the large bowl of an
electric mixer. Let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes. Add the
milk, the remaining sugar, salt and 1/2 the butter. On low speed, add
3/4 cup flour. Beat at medium speed for 3 minutes. On low speed, add
the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a soft dough is formed.
Turn out on a lightly floured board and knead, adding more flour, if
necessary, until smooth and elastic,  8-to-10 minutes. Transfer to a
lightly buttered bowl, turning to coat the dough. Cover and let stand
in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch down the
dough and turn out on a floured board. Let rest for 5 minutes. Roll
out the dough 1/2-inch thick and cut into 3-inch rounds. Make a
crease at the middle of each round with the back of a knife. Brush
lightly with the remaining butter. Fold the dough over and gently
press the edges together. Place the rolls 2 inches apart on ungreased
baking sheets. Cover with flour-rubbed dish towels and let rise in a
warm place for 35 minutes. Preheat oven to 425F. Bake until golden
brown, 12-to-15 minutes.
