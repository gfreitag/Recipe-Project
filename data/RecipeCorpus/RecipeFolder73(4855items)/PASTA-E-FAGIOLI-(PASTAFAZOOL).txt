Categories: Pasta, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings

1/2 lb Italian sausage, sweet
1 c  Onion; finely chopped
1 tb Garlic; minced
2/3 c  Wine, white
16 oz Italian tomatoes, peeled
-& liquid reserved

Peel and crumble sausage.  Cook in a deep saucepan until it has
changed color.  If using a lean sausage, you may need to add a
tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Add the onions and garlic and
saute until the onions are transparent.  Add the wine and let simmer
(not quite boiling) for a couple of minutes.  Then add the tomatoes,
bring to a boil, lower the heat, and add all herbs (except the
parsley), tomato paste, pepper flakes, and canned beans, and let
simmer while the pasta is cooking.

Cook the pasta al dente, drain, and stir into the bean mixture. Toss
in the parsley and stir again.  Add the Parmesan very gradually, and
stir more. Serve immediately.
