Title: PEACH & YOGURT MELBA
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 2 Servings
2    Ripe peaches
1/2    Orange; Juiced
175 g  Greek yogurt
A few raspberries
-(fresh or frozen)
Ripe peaches are marinated in fresh orange juice, which is then mixed
with a yogurt topping. A light dessert, simple to prepare and
refreshing on the palate.

Cover the peaches with boiling water and leave for a minute. Peel the
skins off the fruit, using a sharp knife. Stone and slice them and
put them into a bowl. Pour the orange juice over them and leave to
marinate, turning from time to time, for 30 minutes.

Lift the slices out of the juice and place in the bottom of two glass
dishes. Mix the juice with the yogurt and spoon over the fruit.
Decorate with a few raspberries and it is ready to serve.
