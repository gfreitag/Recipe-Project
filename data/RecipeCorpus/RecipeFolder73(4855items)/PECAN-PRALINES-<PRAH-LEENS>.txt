The quintessential New Orleans candy. And it's pronounced
<PRAH-leens> or <PRAW-leens>, NOT <PRAY-leens>. I've had ferners
(that's Yatspeak for "non-New Orleanian") stand before me and insist
that it's pronounced <PRAY-leens>. Well bra, I'm from The City where
they were invented, and I know how to pronounce it. And you're
certainly entitled to your opinion on its pronunciation, no matter
how wrong it may be ...

Combine the sugar and milk and cook slowly in a heavy pot over a low
flame until it reaches the soft ball stage (238 degrees on a candy
thermometer). Remove from heat and add the butter, vanilla and
pecans. Beat mixture with a wooden spoon until it is smooth and
creamy. Drop by spoonsful onto waxed paper. If the candy does not
harden within 10 minutes, it may be cooked some more.  Walt MM
