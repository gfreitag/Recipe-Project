MMMMM--------------------------NEW YORK-------------------------------
1 c  Warm water as above
1    Envelope yeast
3 1/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar or honey in warm tap water that is
110-115 deg F. (When making the New York Variation, omit the sugar and
proceed as follows). Sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir gently
until it dissolves, about 1 minute. Let stand in a warm spot until a
thin layer of foam covers the surface, about 5 minutes. Discard
mixture and start over if bubbles have not formed within 5 minutes.

If making whole-wheat dough, combine the 2 flours in a bowl and use
as the flour in the directions that follow.

If making the cornmeal dough, combine the flour and cornmeal in a
bowl and use the mixture as the flour in the directions that follow.

To mix and knead the dough by hand: Combine 3 cups of the flour with
the salt in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center of the
flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil, if using. Using a
wooden spoon, vigorously stir the flour into the well, beginning in
the center, and working toward the sides of the bowl, until the flour
is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Dust your hands
with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner: press
down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from
you, then partially fold it back over itself. Shift it a quarter turn
and repeat the procedure. While kneading, very gradually add just
enough of the remaining 1/4 c flour until the dough is no longer
sticky or tacky. This should take about 5 minutes. As you work, use a
metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the
work surface. Continue kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic,
and springy. Too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the flour
and results in a tough crust.

After mixing and kneading the dough, shape the dough into a ball and
place it in a well-oiled bowl, turning to coat completely on all
sides with oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent
moisture loss and set to rise in a draft-free warm place (75-85 deg
F) until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes for quick rising yeast to
1 - 1.5 hours for regular yeast.

With your fist, punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in
bulk to prevent overrising. Shape it into a ball, pressing out all
the air bubbles. If you are using bread flour or semolina flour, turn
the dough in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover again with
plastic wrap and refrigerate it until puffy, from 35 minutes to 1
hour. Omit this step if using all-purpose flour.

If you cannot bake pizza withing 2 hours after rising, punch the
dough down again, turn it in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover
the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. The dough can be
punched down a total of 4 times and kept refrigerated up to 36 hours
before the yeast is exhausted and the dough unusable. Let chilled
dough come to room temperature before proceeding.
