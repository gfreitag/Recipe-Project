INGREDIENTS: Use butter or regular margarine in sticks. Do not use
butter or margarine produced in tubs or squeeze bottles in baking. Do
not use margarine type of products labeled "spread." They will not
perform in the same way as butter or margarine and are not generally
substitutable.

Use all-purpose flour that has not been sifted in these recipes. If
an old recipe calls for sifted flour, remove two tablespoons flour
per cup instead of sifting.

BAKING: Preheat oven for 5 minutes before baking.

Place baking pans or cookie sheets in the center of the oven for best
air circulation. This will help to avoid hot spots in the oven which
could cause burning.

EQUIPMENT: Hershey Kitchens' baking recipes are developed with shiny
metal baking pans (pies are in glass pie plates). If you use dark
metal baking pans, your baking time may be slightly less. If you use
insulated bakeware, your baking time may be slightly longer. If you
use glass baking dishes, lower your oven temperature 25'F.
