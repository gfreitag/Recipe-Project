1 sm Onion
1    Piece of fresh ginger, 1 cm
-grated
1/2 tb Olive oil
150 ml Fish stock
60 ml Dry Sherry
Salt to taste
Cayenne to taste
1 lg Avocado
1/2    Lemon, juice only
300 g  Crabmeat
Cooked pasta for four
If you don't want the trouble of dismantling crabs to obtain the crab
meat, use frozen meat. Canned crab meat is very poor by comparison.
And if you haven't time to make fish stock, chicken stock can be
substituted at a pinch, though the result won't be quite as good.

Boil a large pot of water and cook enough pasta of your choice for 4.
Meanwhile, chop a small onion, grate a centimetre or so of fresh
ginger and simmer them gently in 1/2 tablespoon olive oil until soft.
Add 150 mL fish stock and 60mL good quality dry sherry plus salt and
cayenne pepper to taste. Mash or process together the flesh of 1
large avocado and the juice of half a lemon. Add the avocado to the
fish stock together with 300 g of crab meat, and stir well, leaving
the sauce on the heat just long enough to heat through. Taste and
adjust the seasoning. and add more lemon juice if necessary. Serve
over the hot pasta.
