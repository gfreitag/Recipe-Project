Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Servings
2 3/4 c  Sifted flour
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Salt
2/3 c  Shortening
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Champagne
6    Egg whites
6 lg Marshmallows -- quartered
MMMMM----------------------COCONUT FILLING---------------------------
1/4 c  Butter
16 lg Marshmallows -- quartered
1 tb White wine
1 c  Coconut -- flaked
MMMMM----------------------FONDANT FROSTING---------------------------
1 lb Powdered sugar
1/4 c  Light corn syrup
1/4 c  Water
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1 ds Salt
Few drops almond extract
2    To 3 drops red food coloring
Resift flour with baking powder and salt.  Cream shortening with 1 cup
sugar until light and fluffy. Blend in flour mixture and champagne
alternately, mixing to smooth batter.

Beat egg whites until stiff.  Gradually beat in remaining 1/2 cup
sugar, continuing to beat to stiff meringue. Fold about half of
meringue into batter, mixing gently but thoroughly with whisk. Gently
fold in remaining meringue. Turn into 2 greased and floured 9" cake
pans. Bake at 350 degrees 25-30 minutes, just until cake tests done.
Let stand 10 minutes then turn out onto wire racks to cool. When
layers are cool, fill with Coconut Filling between layers.  Using 2/3
cup Fondant Frosting, spread thin layer smoothly over top and sides.
This seals any crumbs. Pour about 1/2 cup additional frosting over
top of cake and spread quickly to smooth layer. Cover sides of cake
with second layer of frosting. Dip marshmallow quarters in remaining
frosting to coat both sides and set randomly over top and sides of
cake.  Makes 10-12 servings.

Coconut Filling

Combine butter, marshmallows and wine in top of double boiler. Set
over simmering water and stir occasionally until marshmallows are
melted. Remove from heat and stir in coconut.  Cool until thick
enough to spread.

Fondant Frosting

Sift sugar into top of double boiler.  Add corn syrup and water. Stir
over simmering water until smooth. Blend in vanilla, salt, and almond
extract. Stir in food color, if desired. Keep frosting warm while
using so it spreads smoothly.
