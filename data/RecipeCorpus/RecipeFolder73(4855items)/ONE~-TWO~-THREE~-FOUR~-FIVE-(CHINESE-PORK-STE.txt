inches long

Use a sharp knife to cut between the spareribs.  Put the green onions
in the bottom of a large saucepan. Place the spareribs on top of the
green onions.  Add the wine, vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, and water.
Cover and bring to a boil over high heat then reduce heat to low.
Cook about 2 hours, then serve hot.  Makes about 4 servings. Note:
~---- This recipe is really nice, and good for weekends. I suggest
you serve it with white rice to soak up all the liquid.  I think the
name is supposed to indicate how simple it is - it's from an old
chinese cookbook.
