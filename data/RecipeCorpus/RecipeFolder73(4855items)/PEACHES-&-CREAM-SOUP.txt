Title: PEACHES & CREAM SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Peaches
1 tb Lemon juice
1 1/2 tb Amaretto liqueur
6 tb Half-and-half
Grated nutmeg or cardamon
This soup is a good use for overripe or damaged peaches. For a winter
treat, make it with canned peaches.

Drop the peaches into boiling water. Keep the water at a simmer for
about half a minute. Remove the peaches, and let them cool. Then
peel, pit, and slice them. Put the peaches with the rest of the
ingredients into a blender. Blend the soup until it is smooth, then
chill it.

Serve with a sprinkling of nutmeg or cardamon.
