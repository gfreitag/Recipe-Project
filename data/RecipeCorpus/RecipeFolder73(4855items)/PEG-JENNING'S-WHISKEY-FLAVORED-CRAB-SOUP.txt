Title: PEG JENNING'S WHISKEY-FLAVORED CRAB SOUP
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings

MMMMM----------------------------SOUP---------------------------------
1 lb Crab meat
1/2 c  Milk
2 tb Butter
MMMMM------------------------CREAM SAUCE-----------------------------
3 tb Butter
3 tb Flour
2 c  Milk
1 1/2 c  Cream, heavy
4 tb Scotch whiskey
Heat crabmeat in milk and butter.  Make cream sauce by cooking butter
and flour together slowly for 2 minutes, then whisking in milk, and
salt and pepper to taste. Bring to boil and whisk until smooth. Add
cream; stir in crabmeat as soon as it simmers.  When it is just at
boiling point, stir in whiskey.  Serve in heated cups with a
sprinkling of parsley.

No good cook is above profiting by another's mistakes. When his
friend Mrs. Jennings added a splash of Scotch instead of using sherry
in the crab soup she made for him, Beard didn't object to the flavor
but did add her recipe to his lifetime collection.
