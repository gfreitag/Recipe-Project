Split muffins and place on an ungreased cookie sheet, making sure they
don't touch.

Spoon a thin layer of sauce on topthen cover the sauce with a layer of
shredded cheese. Set aside.

Pour the Parmesan into a small bowl and add five drops each yellow,
red and green food coloring until it's an even shade of mold green.
(Use plastic bag to prevent your fingers from staining.) Set aside.

With an adult's help, broil the pizzas until the cheese has melted and
begun to brown. Remove from oven and let cool about 1 minute.

Carefully sprinkle mold on top of hot pizzas. Allow pies to cool
slightly before you slip on a lab coat and serve. Serves 6 peaked
patients.
