Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed oven-proof

fillets and roast in oven for about 4 minutes or until fish is opaque
and just cooked through. Spoon 1/2 cup of Corn Chili into center of a
warmed dinner plate. Top with fish. Mound Mexican Salad on top. Serve
immediately, garnished with lime wedges and cilantro.
