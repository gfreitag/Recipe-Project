Title: PATE DE FOIE GENRE CHARCUTIER
Categories: France, Ham/pork
Yield: 12 Servings
2 lb Pork liver
3/4 lb Lean pork
3/4 lb Fat salt pork
1 sm White onion
1 sm Clove garlic
1 tb Flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground thyme
1 tb Finely chopped parsley
2 lg Eggs
1/4 lb Salt pork
Put the first 5 ingredients through a food chopper, using the finest
blade. Blend in the flour and seasonings and mix well with a wooden
spoon. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Line the bottom and the sides
of a 9 x 5 x 3" loaf pan with thin slices of salt pork. Fill the pan
with the mixture. Cover the top with thin slices of salt pork. Cover
the loaf pan with foil and set it in a larger pan containing boiling
water. Bake in a preheated moderate oven (350^F) 1.3/4 ~ 2 hours.
Cool. Unmold and cut the pate into slices for serving. The pate will
keep in the refrigerator for about 10 days. I have sliced it and
wrapped the slices well and frozen them. Then I just had to take out
as many slices as needed for the first - appetizer ~ course.
