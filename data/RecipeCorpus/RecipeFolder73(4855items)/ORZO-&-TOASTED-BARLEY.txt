Title: ORZO & TOASTED BARLEY
Categories: Side dishes
Yield: 4 Servings
1 ts Vegetable oil; pref. canola
1 c  Barley; quick-cooking
1    Cl Garlic; finely chopped
2 1/2 c  Defatted reduced-sodium chic
1/2 c  Orzo
1 ts Dried thyme leaves; -or-
1 tb Fresh thyme; chopped
1/4 c  Chopped chives; or scallion
Salt and fresh ground black
In a medium-sized heavy saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add
barley and cook, stirring until golden and toasted, about 5 minutes.
Add garlic and stir for 1 minute more. Pour in chicken stock and
bring to a boil. Add orzo and thyme.  Stir once, reduce heat to low,
cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest for 5
minutes to absorb any remaining liquid. Stir in chives or scallion
greens. Season with salt and pepper. Serves 4.

(Footnote:  I am perplexed by that "cutlet cut in half." Which way,
do you think?  Personally, I would do it the long way, that is making
two long, thinner pieces from the thicker cutlet so it would cook
quickly.
