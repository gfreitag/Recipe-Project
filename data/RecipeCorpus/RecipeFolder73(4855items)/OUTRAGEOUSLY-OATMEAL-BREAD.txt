Title: OUTRAGEOUSLY OATMEAL BREAD
Categories: Abm
Yield: 1 Loaf
1 tb Yeast
1/2 c  Oats
3 c  Bread flour
1/2 tb Salt
1 1/2 tb Dry milk
2 tb Oil
2 tb Honey
1 1/4 c  Water
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 11 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

For added texture, add oats after the first knead or at the beep on
the fruit and nut cycle.  For additional crunch, sprinkle a few oats
on top of th loaf after the final rise.

Tried this one yesterday, and not only was it good, it is GONE! I
subbed applesauce for the fat with no problems. I've got a loaf
working now, also subbing whole-wheat flour for part of the white and
with 1/2 c sprouted wheat added.
