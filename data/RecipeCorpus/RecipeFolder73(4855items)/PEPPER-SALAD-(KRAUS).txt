4 lg Sweet peppers *
4 tb Olive oil
2    Garlic cloves, minced
4 tb Italian parsley, finely
-chopped
Salt and freshly ground
-black pepper
2 tb Capers, rinsed
2 ts Balsamic vinegar (optional)
* (an assortment of red, yellow, orange and chocolate)

Roast the peppers in a 425 degree F. oven for 45 minutes, Turn the
peppers several times until the skin is charred all over. Remove the
peppers from the oven and place them in a paper bag for 15 minutes to
let them steam.

Alternatively, the peppers can be grilled whole, then peeled and
seeded. Peel the peppers carefully to remove all the blackened skin.

Cut the peppers open and remove the stem and seeds. Cut the peppers
into 1/4-inch slices.

Over low heat, saute the garlic in the oil for about a minute. Add the
peppers and continue cooking for 5 more minutes. Add half the parsley
and salt and pepper to taste. Remove from the heat and add the
capers. If you want added sharpness, add the vinegar.

Cool and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Garnish with chopped parsley.

Note: These peppers can also used alone or combined with sauteed
scallops and leeks for a wonderful pasta sauce.
