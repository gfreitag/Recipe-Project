Generously season the veal shanks on all sides with salt and pepper.
Dredge lightly in flour, shake off excess. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in
a large Dutch oven. Brown the shanks on both sides until golden, you
may need to do this in batches.

Remove all the shanks from the Dutch oven, and add the onions,
carrots, and celery, cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add
the wine, tomatoes, stock, bay leaf, thyme, and garlic. Place the
seared shanks back into the Dutch oven. Bring to a boil, reduce heat,
cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Adjust seasonings, and serve with
chopped parsley and lemon wedges.
