Ok, all you Nawlins folks++here's some regional recipes for you.
They're from the San Francisco paper so I won't even begin to vouch
for their authenticity, but a couple of them are so complex that they
just about *have* to be real...

Saute green pepper, onion, tomatoes, garlic thyme, ham and sausage in
oil for about 5 minutes.  Add tomato paste and chicken broth; simmer
for 5 minutes.

Add peaches and shrimp; cover and simmer for 5 minutes, until shrimp
turn pink.  Add salt and pepper to taste.

Serve over hot rice.

Makes 4 servings.
