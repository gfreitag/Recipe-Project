Title: PICKLED EGGS (BASIC)
Categories:
Yield: 36 Servings
1 qt Water
1 qt Vinegar, white
2    Onions
1    Yellow waxed peppers (jar)
36    Eggs
Hard boil eggs.  Slice onions very thinly.  Combine water and vinegar
in LARGE container (not plastic). Stir well. Peel eggs, and layer in
jar with sliced onions and peppers. Cover jar and let marinate on
counter. DO NOT REFRIGERATE. Eggs will get spicier the longer you
leave them in marinade. Minimum time is about one week - maximum time
is as long as you wish. When you don't want them to marinate any
longer, remove them from jar and place in container without any
liquid.
