6    Green onions - finely
-chopped
1/4 c  White wine - or vodka
1 1/2 tb Flour
1/4 c  Whipping cream

1 lb Phyllo
1 lb Unsalted butter
Number of Servings:  50

Remove all the meat from the lobster and chop.  Set aside. Melt 2
tablespoons butter in a small skillet, and saute the green onions for
2 or 3 minutes. Add the lobster meat and wine or vodka, and stir
quickly to combine over high heat.  Drain the mixture, reserving the
liquid. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in another skillet.
Add the flour and cook slowly without coloring the flour for 5
minutes. Add the reserved liquid and the cream, and stir constantly
until the mixture begins to thicken. Stir lobster meat back into
mixture, add cayenne pepper and season to taste.  Cool mixture before
filling phyllo. To assemble the triangles, melt and cool the pound of
butter. Place one sheet of phyllo on a flat surface and brush lightly
with butter. Top this with two more sheets, buttering each.  Cut the
sheets in half lengthwise, then cut each half crosswise into 6 equal
parts. Spoon a teaspoon of filling onto the end of each strip and
form a triangle by folding the righthand corner to the opposite side,
as you would a flag.  Continue folding until the entire strip is
used. Preheat oven to 400F. Place triangles on a buttered baking
sheet. Brush the tops of each with melted butter and bake until
golden brown, about 10 minutes.

NOTE:  Filled phyllo triangles can be kept in the refrigerator,
unbaked, for 2 days, or frozen immediately for future use.
