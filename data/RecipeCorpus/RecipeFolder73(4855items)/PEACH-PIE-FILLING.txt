Quality: Select ripe, but firm fresh peaches. Red Haven, Redskin, Sun
High, and other varieties of similar quality are suitable.

Yield: 1 quart or 7 quarts.

Procedure: Peel peaches. To loosen skins, submerge peaches in boiling
water for approximately 30-60 seconds, and then place in cold water
for 20 seconds. Slip off skins and prepare slices 1/2-inch thick.
Place slices in water containing 1/2 tsp. of ascorbic acid crystals
or six 500-milligram vitamin C tablets in 1 gallon of water to
prevent browning. For fresh fruit, place 6 cups at a time in 1 gallon
boiling water. Boil each batch 1 minute after the water returns to a
boil. Drain but keep heated fruit in a covered bowl or pot. Combine
water, sugar, Clear Jel(tm), and, if desired, cinnamon and/or almond
extract in a large kettle. Stir and cook over medium high heat until
mixture thickens and begins to bubble. Add lemon juice and boil sauce
1 minute more, stirring constantly. Fold in drained peach slices and
continue to heat mixture for 3 minutes. Fill jars without delay,
leaving 1 inch head-space. Adjust lids and process immediately.
