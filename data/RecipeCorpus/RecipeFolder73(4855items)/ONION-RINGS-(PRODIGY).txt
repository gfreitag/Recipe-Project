Title: ONION RINGS (PRODIGY)
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
3 md Yellow onions
3/4 c  Flour
1/2    Bottle of beer
1 ts Ground black pepper
1 ts Salt
2    Eggs
Soda water
Frying oil
PEEL THE ONIONS and cut them crosswise into rounds about 3/4-inch
thickness, separate rings and set aside. Place the flour in a mixing
bowl and break in the eggs. Mix, slowly adding the beer until batter
is smooth. Add salt and pepper. The batter should be the thickness of
a thick pancake batter. Thin with up to 1/4 cup of soda water. Heat a
3-inch thickness of frying oil in a deep pot over medium heat on the
stove. When the oil is hot enough for frying (350F), a droplet of
water will dance across the surface of the oil and evaporate. Dip the
onion rings a few at a time in the batter. Remove from batter and let
the excess drip off. Carefully place rings in the hot oil and fry
until golden. Remove the rings as they are done. Keep warm in a 200F
oven until all the rings are fried.
