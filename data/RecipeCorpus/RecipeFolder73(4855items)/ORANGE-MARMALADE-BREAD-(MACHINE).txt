HITACHI
1 c  Tap Water
1/2 c  Orange Marmalade
3 c  All-Purpose Flour

This menu can not be used on delay timer.  **NOTE** The height of
bread will be shorter than the "BASIC WHITE BREAD". Place ingredients
into pan according to directions for machine. Press Start. My notes**
This is especially good for toast.  I might even be tempted to add a
bit of food coloring to give it a deeper orange color... 8-}
