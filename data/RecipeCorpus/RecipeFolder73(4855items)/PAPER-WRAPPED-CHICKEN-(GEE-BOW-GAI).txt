MMMMM----------------WRAPPING PAPER WRAPPED CHICK---------------------
1. Skin and bone chicken; then cut into pieces 1 1/2" x2" long.

2. Sprinkle chicken with each of the ingredients listed under
"marinade," mix well and then add the green onions and ginger.
Marinate for 2 hours.

3. See diagrams for wrapping.

4. Heat the oil to 325 degrees and then carefully put each package
into the oil.  Deep-fry 4 minutes on each side. Put packages in a
strainer to drain off excess oil before serving.

NOTE: Paper Wrapped Chicken may be deep-fried several hours in
advance and reheated in the oven (325 degrees) for 10 minutes just
before serving. 1. Brush center of the paper with oil, and with one
corner of the paper toward you, place 1 piece of chicken and 1 sliver
of green onion about 2" from that corner.

2. Fold the corner to just cover the chicken.

3. Fold once more...about 1 1/4," and tuck second edge under meat
(This forms a triangle.)

4. Make an envelope by folding the left and right corners toward the
middle.

5. Tuck in the flap to close the envelope.
