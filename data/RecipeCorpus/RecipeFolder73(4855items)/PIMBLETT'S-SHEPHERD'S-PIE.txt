Mash potatoes until smooth and fluffy.  Keep warm.

For filling, heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add onions,
parsley, thyme and sage.  Cook 5 minutes or until onions have softened
slightly.  Add beef and water to pan, stirring frequently to break up
meat; cook until no longer pink, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in

occasionally.

Stirring continuously, add flour, bouillon cube, sugar, ketchup,
mustard, worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper to taste. Cook 5
minutes. Skim and discard any fat.

Place meat mixture in buttered ovenproof casserole dish about 9 inches
square.  Spread potato mixture on top. Score topping using prongs of
fork. Bake in preheated 350 degrees F oven 30 to 40 minutes, until
potatoes are golden brown on top and filling is hot.
