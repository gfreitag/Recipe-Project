Title: PEPERONI AL VASO (MARINATED PEPPERS)
Categories: Vegetables, Preserves, Italian
Yield: 4 Servings
6 1/2 lb Green peppers
12    Basil leaves
4 c  White-wine vinegar
4 c  Balsamic vinegar
1 ts Sugar
4 ts Salt
4 cl Garlic, cut in half
4 cl Garlic, chopped
3 1/2 oz Capers
7 oz Canned anchovy fillts
Extra virgin olive oil
Wash, core and seed the green peppers and cut into long thin strips.
In a deep casserole, put both vinegars, the sugar, salt and halved
garlic cloves. Bring to a strong boil, then add the green peppers and
cook for 10 minutes. Remove the peppers from the liquid and place on
paper towels to dry. Put a layer of green peppers into a glass jar
and cover with some chopped garlic, a pinch of capers, a few small
anchovy pieces and a few basil leaves. Add a second layer of green
peppers and repeat the process until all the ingredients have been
used. Top with basil. Add fresh oil, a little at a time, pressing the
jar contents down with your fingers to force the oil well down into
the jar and thoroughly coat all the ingredients. At least 1/2-inch of
oil must cover the top and any air pockets must be eliminated. Seal
the jar hermetically and store in a cool dark place for 20 days.
