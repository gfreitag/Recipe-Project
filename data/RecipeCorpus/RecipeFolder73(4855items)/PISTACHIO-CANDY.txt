Title: PISTACHIO CANDY
Categories: Candies, Gifts
Yield: 4 Dozen
3 oz Box Vanilla Pudding
-mix, (NOT instant)
1 c  Granulated sugar
5 oz Can Evaporated milk
2 tb Butter or Margarine
1 tb Pistachio
Green food coloring
1/2 c  Pistachio nuts, chopped
Grease an 8 x 13-inch cake pan or candy molds (if you have them). Set
aside.

In a medium saucepan, combine the pudding mix, sugar and evaporated
milk. Stir to combine. Over medium heat, bring mixture to a boil.
Continue boiling 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and
stir in the butter and flavoring. Tint to desired color.

Pour mixture into a medium bowl. Beat on high speed with an electric
mixer 4-5 minutes or until mixture thickens and is no longer glossy.
Fold in the pistachio nuts.

Pour mixture into candy molds, or into the greased pan.

Refrigerate until firm.

Wrap candy pieces in plastic wrap, or if you can find it, colored
paper. Of course you'll have to cut the candy in the pan. If you have
small hors d' ouvre cutters, that would work in lieu of the candy
molds. Plain ol' squares work too.

Find a pretty box to put the candy in if you'll be giving these as
gifts. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
