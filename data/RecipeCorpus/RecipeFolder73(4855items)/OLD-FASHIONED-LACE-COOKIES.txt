Title: OLD-FASHIONED LACE COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 48 Servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Finely chopped pecans
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
8 tb Butter
2/3 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
These cylinders-of-lace cookies are a lovely accompaniment to a fruit
or custard, or may be enjoyed all by themselves. You can also whip
cream and pipe it into the delicate cylinders.

PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Sift the flour and toss with the chopped pecans.
Combine the corn syrup, butter and brown sugar in a saucepan. Bring
the mixture to the boil over moderate heat, stirring constantly.
Remove the pan from the heat. Gradually stir in the flour and nut
mixture. Cool slightly. Drop the batter by level teaspoonfuls about 3
inches apart on a non-stick cookie sheet. Bake 5-to-6 minutes, or
until most of the bubbling stops and the cookies are a caramel color.
Remove them from the oven and let them cool on the sheet just until
they can be handled. While the cookies are still hot, remove each in
turn and roll it into a cylinder around the handle of a wooden spoon.
If they are too hard to be rolled, return them to the oven for a
minute to soften them slightly. If they break, eat them. These freeze
well in a tight container.
