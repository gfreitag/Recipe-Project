2 tb Vegetable oil
1 tb Coarsley chopped garlic
8    Shrimp, peeled and deveined
(here you can use a 1/4 lb

Shrimp)

1 tb Fish sauce
2 ts Sugar
2 tb Coarse chpd, dry-roasted
Peanuts
1 c  Bean sprouts
4    Slender green onions,
-sliced in 1 inch length

Soak rice noodles in warm water to cover for 15 to 20 minutes.
Prepare all the remaining ingredients and place them next to the
stove, along with a small serving platter. When the noodles are very
limp and white, drain and measure 2-1/2 cups. Set by the stove as
well. The idea is to keep everything warm. Heat Wok or large skillet
at medium-hi heat and add 1 tbs oil and swirl to coat the surface.
When oil if very hot drop in garlic and toss until golden, about 30
seconds. Add shrimp and toss until they turn pink, for beef or pork
until light brown, no more that 1 min. for shrimp. Remove from pan
and set aside. Add the egg to pan and tilt the pan to spread it into
a thin sheet. As soon as it begins to set, scramble it to break it
into small lumps. Remove and set aside with shrimp. Heat 1 tbs of oil
in wok or skillet and heat 30 seconds and add soften noodles. Thin
noodles to cover the surface of the pan, then clump them together and
gently turn over. repeat this process until the noodles soften and
curl into ivory ringlets. Add fish sauce and turn noodles to evenly
season. Add sugar and peanuts and continue to turn the noodles to
season. Reserve some of the bean sprouts, green onion for garnish.
Add the bean sprouts, green onions and the shrimp and egg mixture.
Cook for 1 minute, turning often. Transfer noodles to the serving
paltter and squeeze the juice of 2 lime wedges over the top. Garnish
with remaining beansprouts and lime and serve at once. Serves 1 very
hungry, or 2 appetizers.
