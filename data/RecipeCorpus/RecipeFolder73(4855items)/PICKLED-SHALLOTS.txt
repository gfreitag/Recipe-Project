Stephen Ceideburg
3/4 c  Red wine vinegar *
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Water
1    Bay leaf, bruised
3    Or 4 sprigs fresh thyme,
-bruised
3/4 lb Fresh shallots, peeled and
-thinly sliced **
* (more or less depending upon strength) ** (do not use shallots that
are withered or sprouting)

From Catherine Brandel. These shallots turn a pretty rosy pink from
the red wine vinegar. They're crunchy because they are not allowed to
cook, simply to soak up the sweet-sour solution. The solution should
not be pickley. Taste it, the amount of water and sugar depends on
strength of your vinegar.

Combine all ingredients except the shallots and bring to a boil.

Put the shallots in a clean, dry jar and cover with the sweet-sour
solution. Let cool cover, and store in the refrigerator. These will
keep 2 weeks or more.

Uses: Add to salads, or meat dishes, or simply nibble them whenever
you feel like it.

Makes about 1 pint.
