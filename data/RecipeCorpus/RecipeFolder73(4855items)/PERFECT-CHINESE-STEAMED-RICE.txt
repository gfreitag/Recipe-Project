Title: PERFECT CHINESE STEAMED RICE
Categories: Oriental
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Uncooked long-grain rice
3 1/2 c  Water
PUT THE RICE INTO A LARGE BOWL and wash it in several changes of water
until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and put in a heavy pot
with the water and bring to a boil. Continue boiling until most of
the surface liquid has evaporated. This should take about 15 to 20
minutes. The surface of the rice should have small indentations like
a pitted crater. At this point, cover the pot with a very
tight-fitting lid, turn the heat as low as possible and let the rice
cook undisturbed for 15 to 20 minutes. There is no need to fluff the
rice before serving it.
