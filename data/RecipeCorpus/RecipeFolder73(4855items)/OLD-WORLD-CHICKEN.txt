Title: OLD WORLD CHICKEN
Categories: Chicken
Yield: 1 Servings
Boneless Chicken breasts
Seasoned bread crumbs
Munster cheese -- sliced
Wine
This is one of those recipes that you use "enough for your family".
For 2 adults I use 3 breasts and cheese slices. Maybe about 1/3 C
crumbs and less than 1/4 C wine. I use Non-alchol wine, zinfandel. No
specific kind was mentioned. Using a meat mallet or heavy cup, pound
the chicken to flatten somewhat. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Dredge
(coat) chicken withcrumbs. Place in baking dish single layer.
Sprinkle with about 1-2 Tablespoons wine. Bake for 20-30 minutes.
Take out and place a slice of cheese on each piece of chicken.
Sprinkle with 2-3 Tablespoons wine. Turn oven up to 350 and Bake
another 20-30 minutes. You will be surprised how good this simple
dish is! Source:  Mr. Food on a radio program 12/94. Formatted for MM
