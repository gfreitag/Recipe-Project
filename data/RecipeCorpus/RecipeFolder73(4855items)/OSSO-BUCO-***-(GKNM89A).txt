Salt and freshly ground pepp

5 - 6   lb veal shank; 2" thick 1. season flour with salt and pepper,
dredge pieces of veal in it and shake off excess. 2. Heat oil and
butter in lg dutch oven, and quickly sear the veal over med-high
heat, browning well on all sides. Transfer veal to paper towels to
drain. 3. Add the onions, garlic, basil, and oregano to the pan and
cook over med heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. 4. Add the
tomatoes, salt and pepper to taste and continue to cook for 10 min.
Skim off any fat. 5. Add the wine, raise the heat, and bring to a
boil; Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered for 15 min. 6. Return the
veal to the pan and add just enough stock to cover the meat.  Cover
and let simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Or bake in 350 degree oven for
the same time. Remove lid and continue to simmer or bake for 1/2 hour
till veal is tender. 7. Just before serving, sprinkle with the lemon
zest and parsley. It is traditional to serve this with risotto
Milanase. It has been suggested that I try ( and I will!) small
potatoes, tossed with some olive oil and garlic or any kind of pasta
treated the same way. Let me know if you try it and what you think!
