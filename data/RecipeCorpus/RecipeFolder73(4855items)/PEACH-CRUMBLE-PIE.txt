Categories: Pies, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 10 Servings
1    No-Roll Pie Shell
-(See RECIPE)
MMMMM-----------------------CRUMB TOPPING----------------------------
1/2 c  Butter
1/2 c  Light brown sugar
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
MMMMM-----------------------PEACH FILLING----------------------------
2 1/2 lb Ripe freestone peaches
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Flour
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1 ts Finely grated lemon zest
PREPARE AND REFRIGERATE pie shell. For the crumb topping: Melt butter
and stir in brown sugar evenly. Stir in flour, then allow to rest 5
minutes. Break up into large crumbs using fingertips. Preheat oven to
350F. Set a rack in the lowest level of the oven. Cut a cross in the
blossom end of each peach and plunge them a couple at a time into a
pan of boiling water for about 30 seconds. Remove to a bowl of cold
water and slip off skins. If peaches are ripe, skins will slip off
easily. If not, touch up with a paring knife. Halve and pit peaches,
then cut each half in 5 or 6 wedges. Place peaches in a bowl and
sprinkle with remaining filling ingredients, toss well to coat and
pour into pie shell. Sprinkle crumbs evenly over filling and bake
about 30-to-40 minutes, until filling is bubbling and crumbs appear
well colored. Cool on a rack and serve lukewarm or at room
temperature.
