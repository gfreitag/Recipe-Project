1 1/2 tb Pumpkin seeds
1/2 ts Coriander seeds
1/2    Inch of cinnamon stick
1/4 ts Black peppercorns
3 cl Garlic
2 ts Sugar

2 tb Butter; unsalted
3 tb Shallots; chopped
1/2 c  Mushrooms; sliced
3 c  Chicken broth
3/4    Piece vanilla bean; split
.  lengthwise
.  *OR*
.  2 Tsp vanilla extract
1/2 c  Half-and-half
1. Place pumpkin and coriander seeds, cinnamon and peppercorns in a
shallow baking pan and bake in a preheated 350-degree oven until the
pumpkin seeds release their oils and turn light brown. Remove and
grind in a food processor, blender or mortar and pestle with
remaining rub ingredients. Grind to a fine powder.

2. Rub the mixture onto steaks and refrigerate 2 to 4 hours.

3. Thirty minutes before serving, melt butter in a 1 1/2 quart sauce
pan. Add shallots and garlic and stir over medium-high heat until
shallots wilt about 10 minutes. Add stock and vanilla bean and bring
to a boil over high heat. Continue to boil the mixture until it is
reduced to 2 cups. Strain sauce, removing vanilla bean. Split bean in
half and scrape seeds into the reduced stock.

4. Meanwhile, prepare the grill with high heat. Place steaks over
coals and grill on two sides until rare, medium rare or as
desired.(For a 3/4-inch rare steak, about 3 minute per side. Check
often. Because the meat is low in fat, it cooks and toughens very
quickly). Ostrich meat toughens quickly and is best cooked no longer
than necessary.

5. Add hslf-and-half and cook over medium-high heat until sauce is
warm. Remove and serve with steak.
