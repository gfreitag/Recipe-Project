Title: PEACHY PIZZA DESSERT
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Unbleached flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/3 c  Butter
2 tb Yeast
3/4 c  Warm water
2 tb Maple syrup
Filling:
2 lb Fresh peaches, pitted and
-sliced
1/3 c  Fresh lemon juice
1/4 c  Unbleached flour
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/4 c  Butter
1/4 c  Maple syrup
1/4 c  Graham cracker crumbs
CRUST:

For the crust, combine flour and baking powder; cut in butter.
Dissolve yeast in warm water and maple syrup. Let sit for 5 minutes,
then stir into flour mixture, blending well. Turn onto floured board
and knead lightly for 5 minutes, adding flour as necessary.  Let
dough rest for 10 minutes. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out the
dough to fit either a cookie sheet or round 10-inch pizza pan.
Transfer dough to oiled pan. If the dough is too sticky to lift from
board to pan, then, using your hands, pat the dough into the pan you
will use. Pinch up edges 1-inch all the way around cookie sheet or
pizza pan to form rim.

Slice peaches and pour lemon juice on top; set aside.

Cut together flour, nutmeg, butter, maple syrup and graham cracker
crumbs. Spread and sprinkle half of it over the bottom of the pizza
dough. Arrange the peach slices on the dough, in layers if necessary.
Sprinkle remaining mixture on top of peaches.  Bake at 350 degrees
25-30 minutes. Serve warm or cooled.

Even if you have never worked with yeast before, you'll find this
crust quite easy.

Serves 6.
