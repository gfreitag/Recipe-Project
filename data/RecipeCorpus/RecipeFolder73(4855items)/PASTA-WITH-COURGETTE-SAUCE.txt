A simple pure of steamed courgettes and garlic is all that this
sauce is - and it is wonderful. The flavours are lovely, the colour
is fresh green. Serve this dish with a tossed salad and some fresh
bread.

Steam the courgettes until tender, about 5 minutes. Cool, chop them,
then put in the liquidizer and blend to a pure with the olive oil.
Season to taste with garlic, salt and pepper.

Cook the pasta in boiling, salted water until 'al dente', then drain
well. Toss the vinaigrette into the warm pasta and serve on warm
plates. Spoon the courgette sauce over the top and garnish with
chopped chives. Sprinkle grated cheese over the top.
