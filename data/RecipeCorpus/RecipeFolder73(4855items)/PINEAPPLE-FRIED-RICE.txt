Title: PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE
Categories: Oriental
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lg Fresh pineapple
2 c  Cooked long-grain white rice
1 oz Chinese dried mushrooms
1 sm Onion; finely chopped
2 tb Oil, preferably peanut
1/4 lb Chinese long beans
-(OR Green Beans),
-trimmed and diced
2    Eggs
2 tb Dark soy sauce
1 tb Fish sauce (optional)
CAREFULLY CUT OFF and save the pineapple top, leaving about 1-inch of
the pineapple under the leaves. Scoop out the inside fruit leaving
the skin of the pineapple whole to use as a bowl for the fried rice.
Coarsely chop the pineapple meat. Soak the dried mushrooms in warm
water for 20 minutes until they are soft. Squeeze the excess liquid
from the mushrooms and remove and discard their stems. Cut the caps
into small dice. Heat a wok or large frying pan until it is hot. Then
add the oil and wait until it is almost smoking. Add the mushrooms,
onions, beans and stir-fry for one minute. Mix in the cooked rice and
stir-fry it for one minute. Add the eggs, soy sauce and fish sauce
and continue to stir-fry for five minutes over high heat. Add the
chopped pineapple and continue to stir-fry for about two minutes.
Scoop the mixture into the hollowed-out pineapple shell, replace the
top and serve the remaining rice on a platter.
