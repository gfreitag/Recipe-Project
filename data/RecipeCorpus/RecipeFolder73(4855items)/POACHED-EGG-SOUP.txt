Heat the broth to simmering. Pour enough of it into a large skillet
to make a depth of about 1" and bring to simmer. Bread the eggs 1 by
1 in a sauce and slide them into the skillet. Simmer for 4 to 5
minutes or until done to your liking. Remove the eggs to soup bowls
with a slotted spoon and fill the bowls with the rest of the broth.
