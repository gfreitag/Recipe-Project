24    Large oysters
1    Pair sweetbreads (about
-1 1/2 pounds)
3    Lemon slices
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Ground mace
1/4 c  Butter

1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Light cream
Drain the oysters, reserving 3/4 c liquor.  Wash the sweetbreads in
cold water.  Let stand in cold water 20 minutes. Drain. Combine the
sweetbreads and lemon slices in a saucepan. Cook, covered, in boiling
salted water for 30 minutes.  Drain and cover the sweetbreads with
cold water. When cool enough to handle remove any connecting membrane
and cut them into 1-inch pieces.  Combine the oysters and
sweetbreads. Sprinkle with the salt, pepper, and mace. Melt the
butter in a small saucepan. Blend the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Slowly stir in the cream and reserved oyster liquor. Cook, stirring,
over medium heat until the sauce is smooth and thickened. Stir in the
sweetbreads and oysters. Pour into a 1 1/2-quart casserole. Bake at
375F. for 25 minutes or until bubbling and hot. Serves 5 or 6.
