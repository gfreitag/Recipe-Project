Title: ORANGE-HONEY MARMALADE
Categories: Jam/jelly
Yield: 1 1/2 cups
2 lb Oranges; weigh w/skins on
3/4 c  Honey
1    Navel orange; rind only
The white rind (between the outer skin of an orange and the tough
shell around the pulp) contains bioflavonoids which good
nutritionists say have an important place in nutrition. Ordinarily
you should eat as much of this rind as you can leave on the orange.
Unfortunately, it cooks up very tough in a marmalade, and, if you
leave patches of it on the chunks of orange, you get tough white
patches of it in the marmalade. So, peel off as much as you can.

We like to use a combination of oranges for this: temples, navels,
juice oranges--whatever is available. But we prefer navels for their
peel which has a good texture and flavor.

Peel the oranges, pit them, and cut up into small chunks. Put them
all in a large pot. Add the honey. Shave the navel orange peel into
fine slices and add. Stir and cook, uncovered, over a simmering-low
flame for about 40 minutes or until thick.

Yield: about 1 1/2 cups.
