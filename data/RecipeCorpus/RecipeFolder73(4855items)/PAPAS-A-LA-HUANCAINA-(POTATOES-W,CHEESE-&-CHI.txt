1/4 c  Lemon juice; fresh
1 1/2 ts Hontaka chili*
1 ts Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 lg Onion; peeled/thin sliced/
-and separated into rings
8 md Boiling potatoes; peeled
1 c  Queso blanco cheese**
2/3 c  Heavy cream
1 ts Turmeric
2 ts Red or green chili, fresh***
1/3 c  Olive oil
1    Red or green chili, fresh;
-stemmed/seeded/cut length-
-wise into 1/8-inch strips
4    Eggs;****
8    Black olives
Bibb or boston lettuce leave
* dried, seeded, and crumbled; OR 3 pequin chilies, crumbled

** coarsely crumbled; OR substitute 1 cup coarsely grated fresh
mozzarella or munster cheese

*** seeded and finely chopped

**** hard-cooked; cut lengthwise into halves

In a large mixing bowl, combine the lemon juice, 1 1/2 teaspoons of
dried chili or the pequin chilies, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a few
grindings of black pepper. Add the onion rings, turning them about
with a spoon to coat them evenly with the mixture. Cover the bowl and
set aside to marinate at room temperature while you boil the potatoes.

Drop the potatoes into a large pot of lightly salted boiling water
(enough to cover them completely), and boil the potatoes briskly
until they are tender but not falling apart.

Meanwhile make the sauce by combining the cheese, cream, turmeric,
chopped fresh chili, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a few grindings of pepper
in the jar of a blender. Blend at high speed for 30 seconds, or until
smooth and creamy. (To make the sauce by hand, beat the ingredients
together until they are well combined.) In a heavy 10-inch skillet,
heat the olive oil over moderate heat. Pour in the cheese and cream
sauce, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring constantly, for 5
to 8 minutes, or until the suace thickens.

To assemble, arrange the potatoes on a heated platter and pour the
sauce over them. Drain the onion rings and strew the rings and fresh
chili strips over the potatoes. Garnish with eggs, black olives and
lettuce.
