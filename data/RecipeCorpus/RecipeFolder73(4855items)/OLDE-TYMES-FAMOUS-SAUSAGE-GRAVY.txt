Title: OLDE TYMES FAMOUS SAUSAGE GRAVY
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
5 c  Water
7 c  Milk
1 lb Pork sausage
1 1/2 c  Flour
2 tb Salt
2 tb Pepper
Mix water and milk in a stock pot. Place on the stove to heat. Do not
boil! The sausage needs to be chopped. If you use links, put them
through a food chopper. If you use bulk, then chop and stir while
cooking. The sausage should be fried in a cast iron skillet. When it
is done, carefully strain and save the grease. Put the cooked sausage
in the milk and water mixture. Put the grease back in the skillet
over moderate heat. Stir in the flour, salt and pepper to make your
roux. Cook this mixture until it will cling to the spoon and come off
the skillet cleanly. When the milk and water mixture is just under
boiling, stir in the roux quickly while turning off the heat to
thicken the gravy. Serve over biscuits or toast.
