Place a pizza stone, baking tiles or an inverted baking sheet on the
bottom or on the lowest rack of a cold oven; preheat for 30 minutes
to 500 degrees F or the highest setting.

Place dough on a lightly floured surface and pat into a disk. Use a
rolling pin or your hands to roll or stretch the dough into a circle
that is 1/4 inch thick and 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Tranfer to a
semolina or cornmeal dusted pizza peel or inverted baking sheet.

Brush the dough with a little of the olive oil to the edge. Spread
tomato sauce over the dough to within 1/2 inch of the edge.
Distribute mozzarella slices over the tomato sauce and season with
salt and pepper. Arrange basil leaves over the mozzarella, reserving
a few for garnish if you wish. Sprinkle with Parmesan. Drizzle with
the remaining olive oil. Carefully slide the pizza onto the heated
pizza stone and bake for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the bottom is crisp
and browned and the top is bubbling. Garnish with the reserved basil
leaves, if desired.
