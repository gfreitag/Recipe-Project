Title: ORECHIETTE PASTA WITH RED ONION
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 6 Servings
3 tb Virgin olive oil
3 md Red onions peeled/sliced
1 c  Water
1 lb Orechiette pasta
1 cn Flat anchovies in oil (1/4"
Pieces)
2 ts Chopped garlic
1/4 c  Chopped fresh oregano
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
Parmesan cheese
Bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil in a pot.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large saucepan.  When it is hot, add the
onions and 1 cup water; mix well and bring the mixture to a boil. Then
reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 10 minutes, until the water
evaporates.  Remove the lid and cook the onions for 5 minutes over
high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned.

Add the pasta to the boiling water and return the water to a boil,
stirring the pasta occasionally at first so it doesn't stick together
or to the pot. Cook the pasta for 12 minutes, or until firm to the
bite (al dente).

Remove 3/4 cup of the pasta cooking liquid from the pot and reserve
it.

Add the anchovies, garlic and oregano to the onions in the saucepan,
mix well and stir in the salt, pepper and the reserved pasta cooking
liquid.

Drain the pasta well and add it to the onion mixture. Toss to mix,
then divide among 6 plates.  Serve topped with the parmesan.
