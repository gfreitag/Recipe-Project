Title: OREGON HAZELNUT SOURDOUGH BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Baquettes
1 tb Dry yeast; OR
1    Cake fresh yeast; crumbled
2 tb Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Warm water
1 1/2 c  Sourdough starter
1 c  Roasted & chopped hazelnuts
-(Oregon hazelnuts)
2 ts Salt
6 c  Unbleached flour, as needed
Cornmeal (optional)
Place the yeast, sugar and warm water in a mixing bowl. Allow mixture
to sit about 5 minutes, or until the yeast has dissolved. Add the
sourdough starter, hazelnuts and salt. Add flour, 1 cup at a time,
until a stiff dough is formed. Turn out onto a floured surface and
knead for 10 minutes. Place dough in a well-oiled bowl. Cover with
plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk (about 1 hour). Punch
down dough and turn out onto a floured surface. Divide dough in two.
Shape into long baguettes and place on a well-oiled baking sheet
sprinkled with cornmeal (optional). With a sharp knife or a razor
blade, make 3-4 diagonal slashes across the top of each loaf. Let
rise in warm place for 40 minutes. Bake in a 400 oven for 20-25
minutes or until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when
tapped. Cool on a wire rack.
