Mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl and refrigerate. If
you're using onions instead of scallions, you may want to minimize the
"bite" of the raw onion. If so, sprinkle the minced onions with salt
and let them sit for a few minutes. Then press them gently in a sieve
and rinse them well in running water. This sauce will keep,
refrigerated for three or four days. Pebre is a perfect complement to
any Chilean main dish.
