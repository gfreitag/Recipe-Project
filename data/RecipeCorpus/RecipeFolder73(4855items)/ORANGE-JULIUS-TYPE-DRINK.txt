Title: ORANGE JULIUS TYPE DRINK
Categories: Beverages, Non-alcohol, Alcohol
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Milk
1 1/2 c  Orange Juice
1 c  Cold Water
1 c  Finely Crushed Ice
Add all these ingredients in a 48oz blender, adjust Quantities for
individual taste.  Blend on Highest Speed for around 5 to 10 seconds
and pour.  To achieve a closer taste to the real thing use Carbonated
Water but regular tap water will due.  You can also substitute
Strawberries or pineapple for the Orange Juice or mix flavors. I have
adjusted the recipe by taking 1/4th the ingredients and use one of
the New hand held blenders to mix a single serving in a cup.

Be sure when you do this you don't fill the cup too full or you'll
have a mess.
