Pasta salads make wonderful meals through all the seasons of the
year. This one is dressed with a lovely mixture of olive oil,
raspberry vinegar and garlic, which soaks into the cooled pasta,
making it special indeed.

Rinse the cooked, drained pasta bows under running water and shake
them dry. Mix them with the courgettes, pimento and chopped tarragon.

Stir the olive oil, raspberry vinegar and garlic together and dress
the salad with the mixture. Leave to stand for an hour or so for the
pasta to soak up the dressing.
