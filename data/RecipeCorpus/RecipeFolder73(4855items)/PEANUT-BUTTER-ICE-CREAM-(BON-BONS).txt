sauce and topped with peanuts. Chocolate bon bon Ice cream or other
favorite flavor hard chocolate topping: Make sure the ice cream is
hard frozen. Melt 12 oz of semi-sweet chocolate pieces and 1/2 cup
margarine in the top part of a double boiler. Remove from heat but
keep warm over hot water. Use a fork to dip ice cream balls into the
chocolate, working as fast as possible. When you've dipped about 10 -
12 pieces, place then in the freezer and continue the dipping. After
the chocolate is firm, you can wrap with foil or plastic wrap. For a
variation with vanilla ice cream, add 1 Tab instant coffee to the
melted chocolate. I have in a hurry, bought icecream at the market
and with a melon spoon dipped the ice cream out into small balls,
frozen them hard and then dipped in the chocolate as above. A quick
delicious treat when you want that something extra but don't have the
time to spend making it or if you have the time, after the first
dipping and letting the chocolate freeze hard, dip a second time.
