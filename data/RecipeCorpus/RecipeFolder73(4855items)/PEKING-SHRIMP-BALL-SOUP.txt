ginger. Add water chestnuts and shrimp; mix well. With oil-coated
hands, roll shrimp filling into walnut-size balls.  Heat a pan of
water to simmering. Drop in shrimp balls a few at a time and simmer
gently until they float (about four to five minutes).  Drain and
discard liquid.  If made ahead, cool, cover, and refrigerate up to
two days.
Soup - Cover bean threads with warm water and let stand for 30
minutes. Drain, then place on a cutting board and cut in 6" lengths.
In a 2-quart pan heat chicken broth, sherry and soy just to boiling.
Add bean threads and mushrooms and simmer, uncovered for 5 minutes.
Add snow peas and cook for two minutes.  Add shrimp balls and cook
just until heated through. Garnish with cilantro and season to taste
with salt.
