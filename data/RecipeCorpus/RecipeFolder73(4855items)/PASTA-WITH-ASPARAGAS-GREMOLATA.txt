MMMMM-------------------------GREMOLATA------------------------------
12    2x1/2" strips orange zest
4 md Garlic cloves
2 tb Whole Italian parsley leaves

Cooked pasta of your choice
Put the orange zest, garlic, and parsley in a food processor fitted
with the metal blade. Pulse the machine several times, stopping to
scrape down the bowl, then process until finely chopped. Bring the
reduced broth to a boil in a saucepan. (To make reduced broth,
briskly boil 2 cups of broth until it evaporates to one cup.) Set it
aside, covered. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over
moderate-to-high heat. Saute the asparagas until tender-crisp, about
3 minutes. Spoon the asparagas over freshly cooked pasta. Sprinkle
with the gremolata, then moisten with the hot broth. Note: Use a
small, sharp paring knife to cut the strips of zest very carefully
from an orange, making sure to remove none of the bitter white pith.
