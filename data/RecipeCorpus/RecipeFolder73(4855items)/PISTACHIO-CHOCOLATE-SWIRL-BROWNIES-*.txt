Yield: 32 Brownies
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
1 c  Butter; softened
2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
4    Eggs
1 3/4 c  Flour

Preheat oven to 350~. Butter a 9x13" pan. Melt chocolate; set aside to
cool. In large bowl, beat together butter, sugar and vanilla until
light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Blend in flour and
salt. Divide batter in half. To one half, add almond extract, chopped
pistachios, and enough green food color to tint batter a light green
(2-4 drops). To other half of batter, stir in melted chocolate and
chocolate chips; mix well. Spoon batter alternately into pan,
checkerboard fashion. Swirl batters to get a marbled effect. Bake for
45 minutes or until tested done. Cool completely; cut into bars.
