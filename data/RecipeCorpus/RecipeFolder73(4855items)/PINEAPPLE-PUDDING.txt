Title: PINEAPPLE PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
4 oz Butter (not margarine)
3/4 c  Sugar
4    Eggs
1 cn Crushed pineapple
4    Pieces of bread, cubed,
-crusts included
Cream room-temp butter and sugar together--this can be done right in
the casserole dish it will be baked in. Beat in eggs, one at at a
time. Stir in the crushed pineapple (make sure you drain it very
well). Fold in the cubed bread--I use white but I guess you can use
whatever. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 45 minutes--the edges will
turn golden brown and it will get all bubbly. Serve warm, as a
sidedish with your meal. It could be used as a dessert, but we
usually indulge with our main meal)

You can cut down on the amount of butter if you want--I usually only
use 3/4 of a stick.  Leftovers heat up very well, too. Enjoy!
