Title: PECAN TART
Categories: Bakery, Desserts, Nuts, Vegetarian, Karen's
Yield: 8 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/8 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground allspice or cloves
1/3 c  Oil
1/4 c  Cold water
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
8 oz Pitted dates
3 tb Maple syrup
3 tb Water or more syrup
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon or allspice
6 oz Pecans (halves or pieces)
-OR- other nuts, chopped
Preheat oven to 375 F.

CRUST: In food processor, combine flour, salt, cinnamon and allspice.
Add oil and process until mixture resembles fine crumbs, about 10
seconds. Add water and process another 10 seconds, until ingredients
are evenly combined and form tiny beads of dough. Transfer to an
ungreased 9" tart pan and press crumbs onto bottom and sides of pan
to form crust. Set aside while you prepare filling.

FILLING: Finely mince dates and combine with remaining ingredients.
Mix thoroughly, then spread filling evenly in crust. Bake for about
30 minutes, until crust and top of filling are both nicely browned.

NOTES: Depending on your individual preference, you may wish to add
more liquid and/or flavoring (water, syrup, orange juice, grated
orange or lemon rind, liqueur, etc) to this recipe. Other nuts work
well too, particularly coarsely chopped almonds or macadamia nuts.
