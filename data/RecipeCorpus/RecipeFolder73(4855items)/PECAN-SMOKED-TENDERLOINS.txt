Title: PECAN SMOKED TENDERLOINS
Categories: Main
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Pork tenderloin
1/2 c  Soy sauce
2    Cloves garlic -- minced
1 tb Grated fresh ginger
1 tb Sesame oil
1/4 c  Honey
2 tb Brown sugar
Combine all ingredients in a shaker and shake like the dickens. I
like to use whole fresh ginger sliced into pieces 1/8-1/4 inch thick.
That way I can remove them before grilling. I am not a big ginger
fan, thus my slicing idea. I really think ginger can over power
milder woods too. However, if you like ginger then go for the grated
ginger.

Marinate for at least 2hrs. or longer. I like overnight.

Start your fire and put on your smokin' wood, I like pecan for this
but use what you prefer. Any flavor should be fine.

Sear over direct heat for about 5-8 min. On a gas grill reduce the
heat to medium and move to *indirect* heat for about 35-40 min. (That
simply means to leave one side's burner ON and put the meat on the
other, OFF, side.)

For charcoal grills, still do indirectly, but just go with the flow.
If you're using a kettle type cooker and have the coals piled up
high, watch your meat thermometer. Actually, watch your thermometer
whatever you do.

Exact times are not really needed if you use a thermometer. The
digital probe thermometer is made for this kind of recipe. Set the
temp watch for 155 temp. and go about your business.

Tenderloins go from perfect to dry rather quickly. They are easy if
you just watch the internal temperature closely. Cook them to an
internal temperature of 155 deg. then transfer the loins to foil for
10 min. The tenderloins will complete their cooking to 160deg. in the
foil. The internal temp. of 160 is perfect to produce moist tender
tenderloins. Great tasting. Be careful not to spill the juices that
will pool in the foil. Pour this juice over the loins in your serving
plate.
