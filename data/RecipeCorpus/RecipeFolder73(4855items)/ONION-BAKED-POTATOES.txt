Title: ONION BAKED POTATOES
Categories: Digest, July
Yield: 2 Servings
2 md Baking potatoes
1 md Onion
x  Salt
x  Pepper
x  Other herbs to taste
2    Pieces wax paper (or foil)
Pieces big enough to wrap
Potaotes in
Slice potatoes into 1" rounds, but retain the potatoe shape, and
place on the wax paper.  Slice onion into 1/4" slices, slip each
slice between slices of potatoes. Sprinkle with spices. Wrap tight in
wax paper. Nuke 20 minutes or until done.  (For oven wrap in alumium
foil and bake 45 minutes at 350deg (I think).)

(I've also cut everything into 3/4" or so chuncks and put in a cover
cassarole pan with spices.  Stir to coat and add a touch of water
(basically just enough to coat bottom of pan). Cook until pieces are
soft stirring occasionally.)
