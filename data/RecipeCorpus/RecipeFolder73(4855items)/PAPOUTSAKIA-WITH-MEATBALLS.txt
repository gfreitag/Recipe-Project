1/2 lb Ground beef
2 ts Fresh oregano; chopped
1    Garlic clove; finely minced
Salt to taste
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 lg Onion; diced medium
8 sm Zucchini; cut in 1/2" pieces
5    Garlic cloves; finely diced
1 1/2 tb Fresh oregano; chopped
12 oz Tomato paste
12 oz Tomato sauce
2 qt Water
1 c  Rice, cooked
In a medium bowl place the ground beef, the 2 teaspoons of oregano,
the 1 clove of minced garlic, and the salt. Mix the ingredients
together with your hands so that they are well combined. Roll the
meat into 1" round meatballs.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.  Place the meatballs on a flat sheet and
bake them for 8 minutes, or until they are pink in the middle. Set
the meatballs aside.

In a large stockpot place the olive oil and heat it on medium high
until it is hot.  Add the onions and zucchini, and saute them for 2
to 3 minutes, or until the onions are clear.

Add the 5 cloves of diced garlic and the 1 1/2 tablespoons of
oregano, and saute them for 2 minutes.

Add the tomato paste and tomato sauce.  Stir the ingredients together
and cook the ingredients for 2 minutes.

Add the water.  Bring the liquid to a boil and then reduce the heat
to low. Simmer the soup for 45 to 60 minutes, or until the desired
consistency is achieved. Add the meatballs and the cooked rice. Add
more salt if necessary.
