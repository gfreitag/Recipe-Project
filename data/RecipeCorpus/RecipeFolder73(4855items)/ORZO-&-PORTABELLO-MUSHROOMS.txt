Title: ORZO & PORTABELLO MUSHROOMS
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Portabello mushrooms
1 c  (before cooking) orzo
4 oz Sundried tomatoes
4    Cloves minced garlic (or to
Taste)
2 tb Capers (or to taste--this
Recipe is pretty loose it
Is
All to taste, really)
1/2 ts Each of thyme, marjoram, and
Oregano
1 c  White wine
x  Salt and crushed red pepper
To taste
you can make this in under 30 minutes if you do it all at once. so
put the water on to boil for the orzo, and put the sundried tomatoes
in a bowl with about a cup of water to reconstitute (rinse them off
first as you will use the soaking water later). wash the portabellos
and cut off the stems. put caps in a dish and sprinkle with the three
herbs, then pour the cup of wine over them to marinate. coarsely chop
the mushroom stems, mince the garlic. in a nonstick pan, sautee the
garlic and mushroom stems in a little tomato water or wine. drain
tomatoes, reserving the liquid, and chop coarsely (it's okay if they
are not fully softened at this point) and sautee. the water should be
boiling now so put the orzo on to cook. scoot the
tomato/garlic/chopped mushroom mixture to the edges of the pan and
place mushroom caps in the middle. pour the tomato water over them,
cover, and simmer until the mushrooms are finished, about 12 minutes
(same time as it takes the orzo to cook--hey!). remove the mushroom
caps to a plate (to two plates I mean) and pour the leftover
marinating wine into the pan, and add capers. cook and stir until
reduced. drain orzo and toss with the mixture, and serve with the
mushroom caps. yum! (I was bad and garnished this with toasted pine
nuts and it was great, but I am eating nutless leftovers now and it
is still really good). sorry my recipes are always so rambling.
