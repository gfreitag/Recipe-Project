Categories: Fish
Yield: 2 Servings
3 c  Water
1 c  Dry white wine
2 tb Finely snipped chives
2 tb Minced fresh bssil leaves
1 tb Chopped fresh dill
1 tb Chopped fresgh rosemary
1 tb Chopped fresh tarragon

This cooking liquid can be frozen for another use as a court bouillon
or as a stock for poaching other fish or boiling lobster.
In a large pot or dutch oven, bring the water, wine, herbs, spices,
and lemon zest to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer 10 minutes.
Gently lower the trout into the liquid.  Simmer, partially uncovered,
until firm to the touch, about 10 minutes (or 10 minutes per inch of
thickness of the fish).
Using 2 spatulas, lift each trout out and place it on a dinner
plate.
Blend the butter with 2 tsps. of the cooking liquid (with as much
of the herbs as you can retrieve), and spoon over the fish. Serve
immediately with lemon wedges alongside.
