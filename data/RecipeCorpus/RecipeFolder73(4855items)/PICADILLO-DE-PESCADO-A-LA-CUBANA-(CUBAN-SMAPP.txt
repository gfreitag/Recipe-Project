uncovered, over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and
simmer over low heat until the fish flakes easily, 8 to 10 minutes.
Transfer the poached fish to a platter and allow it to cool. 2. Place
the bread in a small bowl, and cover with the milk. Set aside. 3.
When the fish is cool enough to handle, flake it and combine it in a
large bowl with the onion and parsley. Squeeze the excess milk from
the bread and add the bread to the mixture, stirring well to blend,
then add the salt, pepper, nutmeg, and lime juice. 4. In a large
skillet over medium heat, heat the oil until it is fragrant, then
cook the fish mixture, stirring, until all the oil is absorbed and
the onion is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the hardboiled eggs and
cook, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, and serve. Alternatively, the dish
can be assembled ahead of time and cooked, stirring, 10 minutes over
medium heat just before serving, adding the hardboiled eggs at the
last moment. Makes 4 to 6 servingsSubj: Zarzuelo de Mariscos
