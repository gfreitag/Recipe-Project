Title: PECAN TASSIES
Categories: Pies, Cheese
Yield: 30 Servings
MMMMM------------------------PASTRY DOUGH-----------------------------
8 tb Butter, softened
3 oz Cream cheese, softened
1 c  Sifted a-p soft wheat flour
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2/3 c  Chopped pecans
1    Egg
3/4 c  Brown sugar
1 tb Butter, softened
1 ts Vanilla
1/8 ts Salt
Prehead oven to 325F.  Mix together the butter and cream cheese in a
small bowl or food processor.  Add the flour and blend thoroughly.
Divide and shape into 30 balls. Wrap all 30 balls together in plastic
wrap and chill slightly.  Place each ball in a tiny ungreased fluted
tart pan or muffin cup.  Line the pans by pressing the dough with
your fingertips against the bottoms and sides. For the filling, place
half the pecans in the dough-lined pan.  Beat together the egg,
sugar, butter, vanilla, sand salt until all lumps are gone. Pour the
egg mixture onto the pecan topped dough. Dot with the remaining
pecans. Bake for 25 minutes or until the filling is set.  Cool 5
minutes on a rack and remove from the pans before they are cool, as
the caramel will set. These tiny tarts freeze easily.
