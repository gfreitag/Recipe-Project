Use Rice sticks or cellophane noodles. Partially freeze beef before
cutting. Cook's notes: Star anise, fish sauce, hoisin sauce and Asian
chili sauce are available at Asian markets or some supermarkets with
large Asian specialty sections. Use caution when working with fresh
chilies. Upon completion of slicing, wash work surface and hands
thoroughly; do not touch your eyes. Procedure: Combine the beef
stock, ginger, star anise, green onions and fish sauce and gently
simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the ginger, anise and green onions.
Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes. Slice the green
onions, onion and basil leaves as thinly as possible. Slice the beef
as thinly as possible across the grain. It helps to partially freeze
the meat before slicing.  Bring 4 quarts water to a boil. Arrange the
bean sprouts, mint sprigs, chilies and lime on a platter. Just before
serving, bring the broth to a boil. Cook the rice sticks in boiling
water for 30 seconds, then drain. Presentation: Divide the noodles
among 4 large bowls. Arrange the scallions, onion slices and beef
slices on top. Spoon the boiling broth on top: The heat of the liquid
should be sufficient to cook the meat. Serve the soup at once, with
the garnish platter on the side. Let each person add sprouts, mint,
chilies, lime, hoisin sauce and/or chili sauce to taste. Yield: Makes
