Title: PINEY WOODS HUSH PUPPIES
Categories: Breads
Yield: 48 Servings
2 1/2 c  Yellow Corn Meal
1 ts Soda
1 ts Salt
2 tb Granulated Sugar
2 tb All-Purpose Flour
1 tb Baking Powder
1    Egg, beaten
2 c  Buttermilk
1 1/2 c  Cooking Oil (about)
Mix all dry ingredients; beat milk and egg together and combine with
dry ingredients; batter should hold its shape when picked up in
spoon. If it is too soft, add more cornmeal. Drop by molded
Tablespoon into 350"F fat and cook about 1 1/2 minutes; turn and cook
on second side 1 minute. Allow oil to heat a few seconds after
removing a batch. Delicious freshly cooked and hot; however, leftover
hush puppies freeze well. When ready to serve frozen hush puppies,
place on oven rack in preheated 250"F until very hot and crisp. Makes
about 48 hush puppies 2" round. Hints on frying: Using a small
diameter heavy saucepan allows using a minimum oil; a 5 or 6 inch pan
with oil 1 1/2 inches deep and heated to 350"F will cook three hush
puppies in about 2 1/2 minutes. When batter consistency is correct
and oil is at 350"F, hush puppies will become firm, round shapes
almost as soon as they enter the hot oil. If they are cooked in oil
that is too hot, they will not cook in the center. Serving
suggestions: Especially good served with fried catfish, trout,
shrimp, oysters, chicken or chicken-fried steak. Source: Texas
