Title: OVEN FRIED PECAN CORNMEAL CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Chicken breast
1 c  Vegetable oil
3 tb Dijon mustard
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Paprika
1 c  Finely ground pecans
1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
HEAT THE OVEN TO 400F. Pound the chicken breast halves to an even
thickness. Pour 1/2 cup of the oil into a 9-by-13-inch baking dish,
and heat it in the hot oven for 10 minutes. Combine the remaining oil
with the mustard, salt, pepper and paprika in a shallow bowl, and mix
well. Combine the pecans and cornmeal on a sheet of wax paper. Dip
the chicken pieces in the seasoned oil, and then in the nut mixture.
Remove the pan from the oven, and place the chicken pieces in the
pan. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn with tongs, and bake for an
additional 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels, and serve immediately.
Serves 4 to 6.
