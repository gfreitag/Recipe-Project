Title: ORANGE & HONEY BREAD PUDDING
Categories: New, Text, Import
1    stick (4 ounces) unsalted
butter
Yield: 4 Servings
:
30 sl French bread, between 1/8
and 1/4-inch thick,
:
1 1/2    inches in diameter, -- about
3    to 4 ounces
2 c  milk
1 c  heavy cream
2/3 c  honey, -- preferably orange
blossom
:
3    California navel oranges
5 lg eggs

Note: The oranges can be peeled and sliced after using their zest to
flavor the pudding. Sprinkle them with a little sugar and orange
liqueur and serve them along with the pudding.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Melt the butter and cool it
slightly. Dip one side of each slice of bread into the butter and
arrange the bread, buttered side up and slightly overlapping in a
shallow 1 1/2 quart baking dish.

Combine the milk, cream and honey in a saucepan. Strip the zest from
the oranges with a vegetable peeler and add to the pan. Be careful
not to include any of the white pith under the zest or the pith might
contribute a bitter flavor. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium
heat, remove from heat and allow to stand about 5 minutes for the
zests to steep and flavor the mixture.

Whisk the eggs until liquid in a large mixing bowl, then whisk in the
hot milk and cream mixture. Do not overbeat or the custard will have
a great deal of foam on the surface. Strain the custard back into the
pan and skim the foam from the surface with a large spoon. Pour the
custard over the bread in the dish, pouring so that the bread is
evenly soaked and rises to the surface.

Place the baking dish in another larger pan and pour warm water into
the pan to come halfway up the side of the baking dish. Bake the
bread pudding for about 45 minutes, until the custard is set and the
bread is an even golden color.
