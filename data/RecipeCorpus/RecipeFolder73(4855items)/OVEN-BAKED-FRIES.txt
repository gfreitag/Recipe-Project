Title: OVEN BAKED FRIES
Categories: Low-fat, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
3 md Baking potatoes, peeled, cut
1 tb Vegetable cooking oil
Cut potatoes in strips after peeling.  (My note:  new potatoes will
not bake as well but you could pat them dry with paper towel and try
them.)

Coat baking sheet with no-stick cooking spray.  Put potato strips into
large bowl.  Drizzle with cooking oil. Toss together well to coat.

Arrange on baking sheet.  Bake in a single layer in 450 F oven for 15
min. Turn and bake about 10-15 minutes longer. (Note: time depends on
thickness, check sooner if you cut them thin.) Test a strip for
crispness.

Makes 4 servings 1 serving = 35 Cal, trace of fat (3 oz potato about 1
starch/bread exchange.  1 cup cooked diced potato 118 cal, 26.5 gm
carb, 3.3 gm protein, .2 gm fat)
