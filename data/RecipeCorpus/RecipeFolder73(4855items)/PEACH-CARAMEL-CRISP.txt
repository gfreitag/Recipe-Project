*DIRECTIONS*

FOR TOPPING: Butter small cookie sheet. Stir sugar and water in heavy
small saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and
boil without sitrring until sugar turns deep golden brown, swirling
pan occasionally.  Mix in almonds.  Immediately pour mixture onto
prepared cookie sheet.  Cool completely. Cut praline into 2-inch
pieces. Finely grind praline in processor. (Can be prepared 2 weeks
ahead. Refrigerate in airtight container.) Combine 1/2 cup praline
and flour in processor (reserve remaining praline for another use.)
Add butter to mixture in processor and cut in using on/off turns
until crumbly. Set aside.

FOR PEACHES: Stir sugar and water in heavy small saucepan over low
heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring
until sugar turns deep golden brown, swirling pan occasionally.
Immediately pour caramel into 9-inch diameter baking dish with
1-1/2-inch high sides. Carefully turn dish to coat bottom and sides
with caramel. Let stand until caramel hardens.

Preheat oven to 375F.  Blanch peaches in large pot of boiling water
for 30 seconds.  Transfer to bowl of cold water using slotted spoon.
Drain. Peel skin off peaches using small sharp knife. Halve and pit
peaches. Cut each half into 4 wedges.  Transfer to large bowl.
Sprinkle cornstarch over peaches; toss gently. Arrange peaches atop
caramel in dish. Sprinkle topping over.  Bake until peaches bubble
and topping browns, about 40 minutes.  Cool until just slightly warm.
Spoon into bowls. Top with ice cream and serve.
