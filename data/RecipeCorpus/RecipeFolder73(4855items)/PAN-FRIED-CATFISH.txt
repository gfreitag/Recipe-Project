RINSE THE BEANS under cold running water, then place them in a
saucepan with the sherry. Place over medium heat and cook for 2
minutes. Add the fish stock, garlic and ginger and cook for another 5
minutes, reducing by 1/3. Scrape the liquid and beans into a blender
and puree. Pass the puree through a strainer to remove the skins of
the beans and replace in saucepan. Add the cream and cook until the
sauce has a consistency to coat the back of a spoon. Off flame, whisk
in the butter. Keep the sauce warm while you cook the fish. Dry the
catfish fillets on towels and dredge lightly in the cornstarch,
shaking off the excess. Heat the oil in a skillet and when hot, place
the catfish fillets in the hot oil. Cook 3 to 4 minutes on each side,
or until crispy and dark golden in color. Remove to paper towels and
pat dry. To serve, mask the bottom of a serving platter with a little
sauce. Arrange the fillets on the platter, and decorate with
cilantro. Offer the sauce on the side.
