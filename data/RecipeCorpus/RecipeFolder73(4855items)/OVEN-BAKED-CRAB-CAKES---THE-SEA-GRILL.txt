Categories: Seafood, Maindish, Appetizers
Yield: 20 Cakes
5 c  Cornflakes
1/2 c  Mayonnaise

2 ts Old Bay seasoning
1/8 ts Cayenne
2 lg Egg yolks
2 lb Jumbo lump crab meat,

In a food procesor pulse cornflakes until ground coarse, and spread
in a shallow baking pan. In a large bowl whisk together mayonnaise,
mustard, Old Bay seasoning, cayenne and yolks, and then add crabmeat,
salt and pepper to taste, tossing mixture gently but thoroughly. With
a 1/4-cup measure form a crab mixture into slightly flattened rounds
about 2 1/2 inches wide and 3/4-inch thick and gently coat crab cakes
with cornflakes, transferring as coated to a wax-paper-lined baking
sheet. Chill crab cakes, covered with plastic wrap, at least 2 hours
and up to 4 hours. Preheat oven to 400F. Transfer crab cakes to a
large baking sheet. Put about 1/2 teaspoon butter on each crab cake
and bake in middle of oven until crisp and cooked through, about 15
minutes. Serve crab cakes with tartar sauce. Makes about 20 crab
cakes. Gourmet June 1995.
