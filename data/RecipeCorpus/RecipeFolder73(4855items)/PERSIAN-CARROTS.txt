3 lg Or 4 medium carrots
1    Onion, sliced
8    Fresh dates
4 tb Sultanas or currants
2 tb Olive oil
100 ml Water
Salt and pepper to taste
This side dish with a difference goes very well with plainly grilled
or roasted chicken or braised lamb.

Wash 3 large or 4 medium carrots and Slice into rounds. Peel one
onion and slice. Stone 8 fresh dates (or substitute dried) and cut
into slices lengthwise. Have ready 4 tablespoons of currants or
sultanas. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a wide saucepan. Add all
the prepared ingredients and stir-fry for a minute or two, then add
100 mL water, cover and bring to a fast boil. Add salt to taste and
put back the lid at an angle so that steam can escape. Cook for about
10 minutes, stirring occasional- ly, until the carrots are tender and
the water has evaporated. If water remains, remove the lid and raise
the heat to dry it off. Serve.
