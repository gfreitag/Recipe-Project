of the oil. "Splutter fry" garlic, garam masala, ginger and chili
powder. Add spinach and tomatoes. If using green peas, mix in here.
Lower heat and cook 20-30 minutes; until spinach cooks down into a

to the top. Add the cheese or tofu. Heat and serve. Serve 2 as a main
dish, 4 if served with other dishes.
