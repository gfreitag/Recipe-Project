4 tb Unsalted butter;
- at room temperature
8    To 10 slices homestyle
- white bread, egg bread
- or brioche, 1/2 inch to
- 3/4 inch thick;
- crusts removed
4    Ripe peaches; peeled, halved
- pitted, sliced and drained
- on paper towels
3 lg Eggs; at room temperature
3 lg Egg yolks; at room
- temperature
3/4 c  Superfine sugar, blend with
- 1/2 ts ground cinnamon and
- 1/4 ts fresh grated nutmeg
2 c  Milk, room temperature
1 c  Heavy cream, room temp
Pinch salt
2 ts Vanilla extract
Confectioners' sugar,
- optional
Lightly butter a 2-quart or slightly larger ovenproof baking dish. Set
aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter the slices of
bread on one side, using the 4 tablespoons butter. Cut each slice of
bread in half on the diagonal, forming two triangles; arrange the
pieces, buttered side down, on the bottom of the baking dish. Scatter
the peach slices over and between the slices of bread. Beat the eggs,
egg yolks and sugar-spice blend in a large mixing bowl for 3 to 4
minutes, or until well blended. Whisk in the milk and heavy cream.
Blend in the salt and vanilla. Pour the mixture over the bread. Let
stand for 30 minutes. Place the dish of pudding in another baking
dish, large enough to accommodate it. Pour enough warm water in the
pan to rise a little less than halfway up the sides of the dish
holding the pudding. Bake the entire assembly on a rack in the lower
third of the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until just set.
(A knife inserted 2 inches from the edge will emerge without any
moist particles clinging to it.) Carefully remove the pudding dish
from the water bath and place it on a cooling rack. Cut the pudding
into squares and serve warm or at room temperature, sprinkled with a
little confectioners' sugar if you like. Serves 8.
