Title: PAPPARDELLE I (PASTA)
Categories: Pasta, Afghani
Yield: 6 Servings
3 1/2 c  Flour, all purpose
2 lg Eggs
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Oil, olive
3/4 c  Water, warm (approximately)
For Pasta:

Place 3 cups of flour on your work surface.  Make a well in the
center of the flour.

Beat the eggs together with the salt and pour into the flour
well.

Stirring the eggs with your fingertips, gradually incorporate the
flour.  When about half of the flour has been incorporated, drizzle 1
teaspoon of olive oil over the egg-flour mixture and stir it in.

Use a little of the remaining 1/2 cup of flour to rub any sticky
bits from your fingers.  Continue to add the unincorporated flour
alternately with warm water, until you have worked in all of the
flour and just enough water to form a mass that is supple but not
sticky.

Knead the mixture until very smooth and silky (about 10 minutes)
adding flour if it becomes sticky, or a little warm water if it
becomes too firm. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.

Go on to the next recipe and prepare the Duck in sauce.
