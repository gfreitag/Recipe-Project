Title: PERFUMED BATH POWDER
Categories: Personal, Better
Yield: 24 Oz
MMMMM---------------------CHEAPER AND BETTER--------------------------
2 c  Cornstarch
1 c  Rice flour
1 ts Orrisroot powder
Several drops perfume or
-essential oil
Easy and inexpensive. Clouds of fragrance. Rice powder is available
from health food stores and orrisroot powder from a pharmacy.

Mix all and store the powder in a tightly closed tin for 1 WEEK so
that the orrisroot powder will absorb the scent. Transfer to other
containers of your choice if desired.

Ideas: Can be sprinkled from the kind of big shaker that is normally
used in the kitchen. For a special gift, cover a box with an antique
style of paper, add a pretty puff topped with a fancy bow.

Variations: An especially nice powder can be made by omitting any
fragrance from the recipe, and adding 1/2t vanilla to the powder and
1-2 vanilla beans. Store in a tightly closed tin. Or, sprinkle a cup
of rose petals into the mixture, cover, and let the roses scent the
powder. 24 oz Typed by Sherilyn Schamber
