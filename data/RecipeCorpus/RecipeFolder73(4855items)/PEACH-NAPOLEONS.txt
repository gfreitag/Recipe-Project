WHIPPED CREAM: Whip ingredients together until nearly double in
volume and soft peaks form. Keep chilled until ready to assemble.

CARAMEL SAUCE: Combine all in a small, heavy saucepan and cook on
high heat until sugar melts and mixture begins to bubble at the
edges. REMOVE IMMEDIATELY. Whisk in very slowly whipping cream. Allow
to cool.

TO ASSEMBLE: With a sharp knife, carefully split each pastry into 2
layers. Place one layer on a plate, spoon some of the whipped cream
mixture on top.

Place second pastry layer over peaches. Dust with powdered sugar and
serve. Repeat with remaining pastries.

Notes:  - I remove the skin from the peaches
- It may take some practice to get the caramel sauce just
:
right, but the results of a perfected caramelizing technique produces
a first-rate flavor. Walt MM
