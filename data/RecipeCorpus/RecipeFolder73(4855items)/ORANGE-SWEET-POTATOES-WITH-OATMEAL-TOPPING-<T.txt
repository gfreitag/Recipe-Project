Title: ORANGE SWEET POTATOES WITH OATMEAL TOPPING <T
Categories: Digest, Nov.
Yield: 1 Servings
5 lb Sweet potatoes (about
7 large)
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/4 c  Oj
1/4 c  Sweet orange marmalade
1 tb Grated peeled ginger
1/4 c  Prepared butter buds
(optional -- I just used
Water because some
People in philly fatfree are
Vegan; 1/4C is half a
Pk )
1    Box Obies oatmeal cookie
Mix
Bake the sweet potatoes until very soft. Allow to cool.

In a bowl, mash together the first 6 ingredients (peel the potatoes
first!). Pour into a 13x9x2 pan (I used an extra large pie pan).

In a separate bowl, mix up the obies mix, so that it is not overly
wet (the

directions say to add 1/4 cup of water, and then add water by the
tablespoon. I think I probably added 2 or 3 tablespoons.) Cover and
chill for 2 hours.

Crumble oatmeal topping over potato mixture, until it's evenly
distributed. Bake at 350F until golden brown, about 10-15 minutes.
(Make sure the oatmeal has cooked through!) If the oatmeal starts to
turn white, take it out -- it's drying out.

Good alternative to marshmallow topped sweet potatoes. Has the Jackie
Manni seal of approval. =-)
