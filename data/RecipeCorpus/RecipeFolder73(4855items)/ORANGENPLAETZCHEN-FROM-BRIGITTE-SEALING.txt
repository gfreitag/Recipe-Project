Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
8 tb Butter(1 stick)soft
1/2 c  Light Brown Sugar
2 tb Orange Peel Grated
1/4 ts Salt
1    Egg
1 oz Semisweet Chocolate,very
Finely chopped
1 3/4 c  Flour
Glaze:
1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
2 tb Orange Juice
4 tb Lemon Juice
Cream butter, sugar, orange peel, and salt in the mixer at high speed
for 1 to 2 minutes, untill light and fluffy. Add the egg and beat 1
minute more at medium speed. Add the chocolate and the flour and beat
at low speed just enough to combine. Divide the dough, flatten each
half into a 6-inch circle, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at
least 2 hours or, better yet, overnight. When ready to proceed,
preheat oven to 375 F. Roll out each circle of dough, one at a time,
between sheets of lightly flowered waxed paper until scant 1/4 inch
thick, sprinkle with flour once during rolling. Carefully pel off the
top piece of paper and, using 2 1/2 inch round cutters, cut the
dough-still on the bottom sheet of wax paper- into rounds but do not
lift from paper. Slide the paper of dough on a cookiesheet and set in
the freezer for 5 minutes. Than use small spatula to remove the
cookies and space 1 inch apart on a lightly greased baking sheet.
Bake the cookies in the middle of the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until
lightly browned on the edges. Transfer at once to wire racks. For the
glaze: whisk the powdered sugar with the juices until smooth. Using
pasrty brush, brush the glaze on the still warm cookies. As soon as
glaze is hard you can store them with waxpaper between the layers in
airtight containers.
