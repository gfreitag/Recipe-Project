Title: OREGON HAZELNUT-LACED CHOCOLATE APRICOT BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Loaves
1 c  Boiling water
1 c  Dried apricots
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Brown sugar
2    Eggs
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
3/4 c  Whole wheat flour
3/4 c  Unsweetened cocoa
3 ts Double-acting baking powder
1 c  Chopped Oregon hazelnuts
Pour boiling water over apricots and let stand until just tender;
don't oversoak. Drain off water and reserve. (If you don't have 1
cup, add more water to it.) Roughly chop the apricots. Pour liquid
into a large mixing bowl, add baking soda, sugars and eggs. Mix well
with a wooden spoon. Then add the apricots, flours, cocoa, baking
powder and nuts, and mix again.

Butter and flour two 9x5x3-inch loaf tins. Divide the batter into 2
equal parts and pour into the tins. Bake in a 350 oven for about 45
minutes, or until the breads have risen, are dark in color and a
toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool on racks and serve.
