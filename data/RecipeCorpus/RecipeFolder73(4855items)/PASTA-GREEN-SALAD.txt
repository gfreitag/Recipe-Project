Note: This is a really simple throw-together dressing that works well
with other seasonings, fresh herbs, lime juice instead of lemon, and
even lowfat mayonnaise and yogurt, too. You can enjoy this creamy
dressing as above for a hearty summer meal, or simply serve it as a
smooth dressing for your tossed green salad.
