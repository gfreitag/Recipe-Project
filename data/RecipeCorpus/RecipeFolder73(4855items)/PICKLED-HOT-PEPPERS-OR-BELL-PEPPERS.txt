Title: PICKLED HOT PEPPERS OR BELL PEPPERS
Categories: Pickles, Peppers, Appetizers
Yield: 8 Pints
4 qt Peppers
4 c  Vinegar
4 c  Water
4 ts Salt
Olive oil (optional)
Wash peppers thoroughly.  Remove core, seeds, and stems of large
peppers. Cut as desired, or leave whole after coring.  The small, hot
peppers may be left whole with stems intact.  Make two small slits in
whole peppers.

Mix vinegar and water; heat to 150-160F./66-71C. about to the
simmering point.  Since it is rather volatile, vinegar should NOT
boil a long time. Pack peppers rather tightly into jars.  Pour hot
vinegar and water over the peppers to 1/2 inch of jar rim.  If oil is
desired, add vinegar to only 3/4 inch of jar top.  Add olive oil to
come 1/2 inch from top. The peppers will be coated with oil when they
pass through the oil layer as you use them. Add salt to taste, seal,
and process 15 minutes in simmering (180-185F./82-85C.) Hot Water
Bath.
