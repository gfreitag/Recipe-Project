Preheat oven to 350F.  Line cupcake baking pans with paper cupcake
liners.

In small mixing bowl, use electric mixer to combine cream cheese, egg
and sugar.  Blend in 2 drops yellow food coloring and 1 drop red food
coloring, adding more coloring if necessary to reach desired shade.
Use mixing spoon to stir in chocolate chips; set filling aside.

In large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda and
salt; set aside.

vanilla.  Add contents of small mixing bowl to large mixing bowl and

cupcake batter, then place 1 teaspoon filling at center of each. As
cupcake bakes, the batter will rise to surround the filling.

minutes or until cupcakes test done.

When done, wear oven mitts to remove pan from oven and turn off oven.

If desired, frost with orange icing--or just let the orange filling
ooze out as a surprise.
