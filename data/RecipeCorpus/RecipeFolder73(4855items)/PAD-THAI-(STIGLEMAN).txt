Ingredient Notes: ================= Re: Chantaboon rice sticks: <I
think the spelling of "chantaboon" can also be found as "jantaboon"
or something like that.>

Re: Pork, Beef, or Chicken, or Shrimp: <I used tofu when I made this.
If you do the the same, press the tofu between three sheets of towel
paper on the top and the bottom. Put a plate on top and a two pound
weight on top of the plate. Wait 20 minutes>

Re: Sliced salted radish: <These are packaged in a plastic see
through flat container and slightly orange in color>

=======================================================
============== ==

Soak rice sticks in lukewarm water for 1 hour, drain and set aside.
Set wok over high heat, for 1 minute. Heat wok with 1 tablespoon of
oil until sizzling hot and coat sides of wok evenly. Add eggs and
fry, until eggs set, turn over and fry, until light brown on both
sides. Remove from wok and slice thin, bite size.  Set aside.

Heat 1/4 cup of oil in wok until sizzling hot.  Add garlic and cook
