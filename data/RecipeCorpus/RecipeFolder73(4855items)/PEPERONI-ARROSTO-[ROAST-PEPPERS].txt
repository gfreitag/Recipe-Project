Title: PEPERONI ARROSTO [ROAST PEPPERS]
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
Peppers, red and/or green
Wash and dry the peppers.  Broil under a preheated broiler as close
to the heating element as possible, or on a rack on the barbecue
grill. Cook and turn them as the skin chars to black. Roast until
skin is completely black. Allow peppers to cool uncovered. Peel the
peppers with a sharp knife and paper towels. Do not hold under water
as this washes away the flavor. Cut in half and discard the seeds and
the white ribs. Cut into strips about 1/2" wide, if desired.

The peppers are now ready to be served all'olio with a little lemon
juice, or to be used in other recipes.
