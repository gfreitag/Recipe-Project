Many a good barbeque sauce is based on fruit nowadays. Since in fact,
botanically speaking, a tomato is a fruit, I suppose one could argue
that fruit is the most common constituent of any barbeque sauce.
Still, one based on peaches might seem to be asking a lot of taste
buds primed to mediate the hot, spicy flavors of a grill. In
actuality, it provides a soothing contrast to them.

Melt the butter in a small stainless steel or flameproof ceramic
saucepan set over low heat.  Add the onion, and saute until golden.
Stir in the brown sugar, cloves, and cayenne pepper, mixing well.
Drain the peaches, reserving the syrup. Cut the slices in half and
add them to the saucepan. Lightly blend in first the Bailey's Irish
Cream then the pickles. Simmer, stirring gently occasionally for 20
minutes, or until the sauce thickens nicely.  Chill before serving.
This entire sauce may be blenderized to give it a smooth consistency..
