NOTES:

This week I thought I'd try a dessert recipe since Brandon's birthday
is Wednesday and his request was peach pie. This peach pie is one
easy dessert too. You can make your own pie crust, or buy a frozen
one at the store to save time (although I recommend making one). I
bought some canned peaches in light syrup and plan to add about 2
tablespoons sugar or less. Judge for yourself as to how sweet you
want it to be. I also will add a little cinnamon to the crumb
mixture. Yum! Peach pie is one of my favorites. Wish me luck and
Brandon a "Happy Birthday"!
