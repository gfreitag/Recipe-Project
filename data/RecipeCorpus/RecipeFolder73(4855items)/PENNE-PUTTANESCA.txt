3 md Garlic clove; peeled &
-minced
2 tb Parsley; finely chopped
1 tb Red pepper; crushed
1/4 c  Capers; rinsed, drained
24    Kalamata olive, pitted
To prepare the marinara base:  Combine the garlic and basil in a food
processor or blender and chop finely. Add the salt, black pepper and
water; process 30 seconds. Stir into the tomatoes and set aside.

To prepare the puttanesca sauce:  Heat the olive oil in a large saute
pan. Add the anchovies and cook, mashing with the back of a spoon,
until disintegrated. Add the garlic, parsley and crushed red pepper
flakes. Cook 1 minute.  Add the capers and olives; cook seconds.

Stir in the marinara base and simmer 5 minutes.  Keep warm.

Cook the pasta in lots of boiling water according to package
directions. Drain and put back into the hot pan.

Add the sauce and Parmesan.  Stir well and transfer to a heated bowl
for serving.

Note:  The original recipe called for 2 Tbsp salt and 3 Tbsp crushed
red pepper flakes.  Times testers felt that the reduced amounts were
adequate. [Moderator's Note: Maybe for the salt....]

Obmodification:  I plan to reduce the olive oil to 1/4 cup next time,
which is probably more than adequate and cuts down a bit on the fat.

This is from the new Seattle Times column, By Request, which helps
readers get recipes for favorite dishes they have enjoyed at restau-
rants, and to locate recipes they have heard about or lost. As a
puttanesca connoisseur, I've found that Salvatore Ristorante Italiano
in Seattle makes the *best* puttanesca I've had at any restaurant in
the area. The following has been shared by the owner, Salvatore
Anania. Hope you enjoy it as much as I.
