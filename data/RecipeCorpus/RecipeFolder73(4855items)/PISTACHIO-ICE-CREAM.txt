Title: PISTACHIO ICE CREAM
Categories: Desserts, Ice cream
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/2 c  Milk
3    Eggs
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Whipping cream, whipped
1 1/4 c  Pistachio nuts.
1 tb Pure vanilla extract
1 tb Pure almond extract
BLANCH  the nuts by placing in a bowl for one minute and pouring
boiling water over it (  the nuts should be out of the shells). Drain
and peel. BLEND the nuts, the milk, the eggs, and the sugar until you
have a green smooth liquid.  Pour into a saucepan. COOK over low heat
until the custard thickens, about 25 minutes or so. Do not boil or it
will curdle. COOL. When cool, add vanilla and almond extracts.  Stir.
FOLD in whipped cream.

FREEZE in an ice cream maker or in a container or bowl in your
freezer. If you use the bowl in freezer method, you should pull the
bowl out 2 or 3 times and mix the mixture with a mixer. The frozen
custard on the sides of the bowl should be moved into the rest of the
mixture. This incorporates air and breaks up ice crystals.

This ice cream takes a LOT of time, particularly considering that you
have to blanch the nuts.  If you don't mind lots of peel in your ice
cream, you can pass, but this makes a really unsavory ice cream.

If you've never had homemade ice cream before, you will be surprised
at the richer, tastier, smoother, and denser ice cream a homemade
version will give you. You will have to soften it before scooping it,
as real ice cream always requires.
