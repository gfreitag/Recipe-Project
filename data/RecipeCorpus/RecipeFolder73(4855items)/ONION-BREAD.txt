4 1/2 c  Bread Flour

This recipe will make two loaves of bread in a standard loaf pan and
calls for using a bread machine to do most of the labor.

Place all ingredients into the bread machine in the order listed.
Dried minced onions may be substituted for diced onion but water MUST
be increased to approx. 2 1/2 cups. Place bread machine on setting
for white bread and start.  When bread has completed it's second
kneading, remove dough.  Cut dough in half and shape into two loaves
and place in two greased and floured loaf pans. Place into a warm (90
deg) oven on the top rack.  Place a pot of water that has been
brought to a boil on the rack below the bread.  Cover bread with a
moist tea towel.

Allow bread to rise until doubled in size.  Remove towel and bake at
350 deg. for approx. 45 mins. Remove from oven and remove bread from
loaf pans to cool. This bread is particularly good when toasted.
