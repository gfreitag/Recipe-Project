SUCCESS HINTS: For added texture, add the oats after the first knead
or at the beep on the fruit and nut cycle. For additional crunch,
sprinkle a few oats on top of the loaf after the final rise. Instant
oatmeal doesn't work, but quick-cooking oats do. This recipe can be
made with the regular, rapid, or delayed time bake cycles. CALORIES:
