Title: PAD THAI (7)
Categories: Thai
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Rice stick noodles
-(10-16 oz pkg = 0.3-0.5 kg)
2 tb Oil (30 ml)
3    Garlic cloves, or more
- crushed or minced
8 oz Shrimp, peeled (optional)
8 oz Chicken, Pork or more Shrimp
- (Optional), cut into dice
- or matchsticks
3    Eggs
1 c  Bean sprouts
1/4 c  Chopped/ground peanuts
1    Red chile (optional)
- finely chopped
-OR-
1 ts -Red pepper flakes
1 c  Sliced cabbage
Cilantro leaves
Lime wedges
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1/4 c  Thai Fish Sauce
1/4 c  White Vinegar
2 tb White sugar
3 tb Paprika
Soak the rice noodles in cold water at least two hours before cooking.
Drain.

In a large wok, heat oil and stir-fry garlic for 30 seconds. Add
shrimp and other meat if used.

Add the noodles, and stir-fry until al dente.  Add sauce ingredients,
cook to allow most of this to be absorbed (2 minutes or so).

Spread the noodles, etc.  out to the sides, and add eggs. Some will
crack the eggs directly into the wok, others will pre-scramble. If
cracked into the pan, start stirring them up when partially cooked,
so you get 'streaky' yellow and white eggs.  As they cook, fold the
noodle mixture back in.

Add 1/2 the bean sprouts, peanuts, red pepper, folded into the
mixture.

Serve hot, garnished with the rest of the bean sprouts, chopped
cabbage, cilantro.  Serve with lime wedges to be squeezed into the
noodles.

In my house, we have doctored this with thai hot chile sauce, sweet
and sour sauce, or sate-style peanut sauce. It takes to any of these
very well, depending on your tastes.
