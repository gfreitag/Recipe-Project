Poach chicken breasts in lightly salted water or chicken broth until
done, about 10 minutes.  (Or season the chicken with salt and pepper
and bake it at 375 F. for 25 minutes). When chicken is cool, remove
the meat from the bones and slice the meat thinly against the grain.

Cook linguine in salted water according to package instructions.
Rinse with cold water to cool.  Drain linguine.

Place the chicken, linguine, peppers, scallions and peanuts in a large
bowl.

Prepare vinaigrette by whisking together all the ingredients.
Gradually pour the dressing over the salad; mix well. Garnish with
cucumber slices (peel the cucumber, cut it in half, remove the seeds
and slice it) and watercress sprigs.
