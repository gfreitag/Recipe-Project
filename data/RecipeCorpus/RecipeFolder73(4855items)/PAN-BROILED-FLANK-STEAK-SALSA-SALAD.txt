Heat a black iron skillet until very hot; add some Kosher salt. Add
the flank steak and saute, without stirring for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn
over and pan broil for another 4 minutes or until rare.

Cut the steak, on the bias, into very thin strips, across the grain
and toss, while still warm with some salsa and fresh lime juice;
season with salt.

Make a wreath of the greens on a plate, mound the salsa steak in the
center and garnish with chopped red pepper and cilantro, if you wish.

Yield: 2 servings
