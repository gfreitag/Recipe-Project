Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter two 9-inch round cake pans. Line

and salt. Whisk yolks, oil, water and vanilla in large bowl until
soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue
beating until stiff but not dry. Fold dry ingredients into yolk
mixture. Gently fold in beaten whites.  Pour batter into prepared
pans. Bake until lightly golden and tops spring back when touched,
about 30 minutes. Invert cakes onto racks and cool. Mix pineapple
juice, coconut cream and rum in small bowl. Brush tops of cakes with
juice mixture. For Frosting: Using electric mixer, beat powdered
sugar, butter, cream, egg, vanilla and coconut extract in large bowl
until smooth and creamy. Transfer 1 cup frosting to small bowl. Stir
in crushed pineapple. Add rum to remaining frosting in large bowl.
Set 1 cake layer on plate. Spread with pineapple frosting. Top with
second cake layer smooth side up. Frost top and sides of cake with as
much of remaining frosting as desired.  Sprinkle top of cake with
coconut. From "Bon Appetit" magazine, date unknown.
