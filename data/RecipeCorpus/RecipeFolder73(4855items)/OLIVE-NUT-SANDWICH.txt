Yield: 4 Servings
6 oz Cream cheese
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
1/2 c  Pecans,chopped

2 tb Olive juice

Let cream cheese stand at room temperature until soft. Mash with a
fork and add mayonnaise. Add chopped pecans, olives, olive juice and
pepper. Stir well. This will be mushy. Refrigerate in pint jar for at
least 24 -48 hours.  It will then become thick. (Believe it or not.)
You will have nearly a pint of delectable spread! It's best served on
very thin toast or fresh, thinly sliced bread will do. A little
lettuce is a good touch, and cutting into finger tip sizes completes
the feeling of first class.
