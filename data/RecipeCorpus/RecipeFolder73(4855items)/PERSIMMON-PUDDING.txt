Title: PERSIMMON PUDDING
Categories: Desserts, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Pureed persimmons (skinned)
2 ts Baking soda
1/2 c  Butter; room temperature
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
1 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Rum
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Chopped walnuts or pecans
1 c  Raisins
FILL KETTLE THAT IS LARGE enough to hold a 2-quart pudding mold with
enough water to come halfway up sides of mold. Place kettle over
medium heat and let water come to boil while you prepare pudding
batter. Mold must have lid or be snugly covered with foil while
steaming (coffee can with plastic lid will work). Place rack or Mason
jar ring on bottom of kettle so that water can circulate under mold
while steaming. Grease the mold. In small bowl, combine persimmon
puree and baking soda. Set aside while mixing other ingredients
(persimmon mixture will become quite stiff). In mixing bowl, cream
butter and sugar. Add eggs, lemon juice and rum and beat well. Add
flour, cinnamon and salt and stir to blend. Add persimmon mixture and
beat until well mixed. Stir in nuts and raisins. Spoon batter into
mold, cover tightly and steam 2 hours. Remove mold from kettle and
set aside 5 minutes. Turn onto rack to cool completely or to cool
just a little and serve warm. ~--
