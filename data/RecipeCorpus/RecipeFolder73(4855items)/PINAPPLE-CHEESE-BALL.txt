Title: PINAPPLE CHEESE BALL
Categories: Appetizers, Creamcheese
Yield: 1 Lrg. ball
16 oz Pkgs. Cream Cheese
7 oz Can crushed pineapple, very
Well drained
2 c  Crushed pecans
1/4 c  Chopped green pepper
2 tb Chopped onion
1 ts Seasoned salt
While cream cheese is softening, drain the pineapple in a sieve. It
must be very dry or the ball will be hard to work with. Mix cheese
with dry pineapple, green pepper, onion, seasoned salt and one cup of
the pecans. Place in the refrigerator, cover with saran wrap
overnight to allow to harden. With a spatula force the cheese up into
the shape of a ball. Place the remaining cup of pecans on a sheet of
waxed paper and roll the ball shape out onto them, rolling and
shaping the ball as you cover the entire ball with pecans. Place on a
large platter and surround with half slices of sliced pineapple or
just crackers. I find this is so pretty, I usually have to start it
myself. No one wants to cut into it.
