Place the meat in a mixing bowl.  Heat the oil in a small cast-iron
skillet, add the onion and cook, stirring, until wilted. Add the
garlic and cook briefly, stirring. Do not let the garlic burn. Remove
from the heat and let cool.

Add the cooled onion mixture, chili powder, cumin, ground pepper, red
pepper flakes, Worcestershire sauce, and salt to the meat and blend
well. Divide the mixture into 4 patties of equal size.

Heat a heavy cast-iron skillet large enough to hold all the patties
in one layer.  Do not add fat of any kind. When the skillet is quite
hot and smoking, add the patties. Cook until well browned on one
side, then turn and cook 3 minutes more on the second side for medium
rare. Cook longer if desired.  Transfer to a warm plate.

Heat the butter in a small skillet.  Add the shallots and cook,
stirring for 1 minute.  Add the wine and broth and let cook until
reduced about 1/4 cup.  Check for seasoning and sprinkle with
parsley. Serve immediately. Note: If a heavy black cast-iron pan is
not available, use a heavy bottomed fry pan.   Serves 4 Typed in
