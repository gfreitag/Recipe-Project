ORANGE APRICOT BREAD

Soak apricots in enough cold water to cover for 1/2 hour. Squeeze
juice from orange into a measuring cup and add enough boiling water
to make a cup. Pur ornage skins, drained apricots and raisins through
a food chopper. Cream butter and sugar, add vanilla, egg and fruit
mixture and beat smooth. Add dry ingredients alternately with orange
juice and water, blending after each addition. Bake at 350 F for an
hour in a greased and floured pan (9x5).
