Title: PESTO SAUCE-STILL LIFE BY MOLLIE KATZEN.
Categories: Pesto, Sauces, Pastas
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  (packed) fresh
Basil leaves
1 c  (packed) fresh parsley
2    6 oz cans pitted
Black olives
4 cl Garlic
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1. Clean and dry the basil and parsley.  Run through a food processor
(with steel blade) or blender until very finely minced. Remove to a
large bowl. 2. Drain the olives and add them to the food processor or
blender, along with garlic.  Puree until smooth, and add to the herbs
in bowl. Stir in lemon juice.

This is good for 1 1/4 lbs of pasta.  Toss hot pasta in the sauce. It
keeps a week in the refrigerator and can also be frozen. This serves
about 6 people. If you are a big fan of fresh tomatoes, toss some in
with the pasta (with some good olive oil, of course)--very delicious!
