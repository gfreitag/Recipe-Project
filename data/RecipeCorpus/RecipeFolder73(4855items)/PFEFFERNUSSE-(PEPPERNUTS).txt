Title: PFEFFERNUSSE (PEPPERNUTS)
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 12 Dozen?
20 oz Dark Karo Corn Syrup
2 c  White granulated sugar
1 c  Butter plus 1 cup lard
--OR--
2 c  Crisco
1 ts Salt
4    Eggs, beaten slightly
1 c  Buttermilk
3 ts Baking soda
1 ts Anise oil
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Cloves
1/3 ts Ginger
2 c  Finely chopped nuts
10 c  Flour
Boil the Karo syrup for 2 minutes, and then add the sugar, butter, and
salt.  Stir until sugar and shortening are melted, then cool. When
cool, add remaining ingredients (except flour). Add flour in
increments until dough is very stiff.  Chill thoroughly (can even be
frozen).

Roll chilled dough into rolls about the width of a finger. Cut with a
knife into small 'pillows'.  Pat pillows flat and bake in moderate
oven (350 degrees? ~- time is unknown so I'd have to guess maybe 8-10
minutes. This is an old recipe of my grandmothers and it doesn't^?
specify).
