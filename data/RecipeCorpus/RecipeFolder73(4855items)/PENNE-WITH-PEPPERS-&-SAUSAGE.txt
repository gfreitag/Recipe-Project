Heat a skillet over moderate heat, add sausage and cook until browned.
Remove sausage and drain on paper toweling. Discard all but 1
tablespoons of fat. Add onion to fat in skillet and cook slowly until
soft but not browned. Add garlic and cook a minute or two more. Add
red and yellow bell peppers and toss to coat with oil. Add tomatoes,
wine, Worcestershire and seasonings. Cook at a simmer, covered,
stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, adding sausage pieces
toward the end of that period. Uncover and cook over high heat to
reduce to desired consistency. In the meantime, cook penne until al
dente in ample boiling salted water. Drain pasta and toss in a heated
bowl with a tablespoon or so of good olive oil. Serve pasta in heated
bowls with sauce and a sprinkling of parsley.
