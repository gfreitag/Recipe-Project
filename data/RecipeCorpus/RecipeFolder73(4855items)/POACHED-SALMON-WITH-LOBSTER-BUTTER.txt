Title: POACHED SALMON WITH LOBSTER BUTTER
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 12 Servings
1    Whole 7-8 lb. salmon
Salt
MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE BUTTER----------------------------
1/2    Lemon (juice only)
1    Green-black lobster brain OR
4 tb Reduced lobster stock *
6 oz Butter
*Note: Lobster stock should be made from shells and heads, then
heavily reduced to make 3-4 tablespoons.

Scale, gut and wipe the fish.  Rub the inside cavity with salt. If
you have a fish kettle, steam the salmon whole over boiling water for
30-35 minutes (making sure the water is kept topped up).  Or wrap the
fish in lightly oiled foil and bake it in the oven for an hour at 325
F (170 C) gas mark 3. Leave it to rest while you make the butter.

Warm the lemon juice in a small basin over a saucepan of simmering
water. Beat in the nuggets of cold butter, adding more as each one
melts. Do this gently ~ it can split if you overheat it (revive it
with a quick splash of cold water).  When you have an unctuous smooth
sauce like thin cream, sieve and whisk in the green goo from the head
of the lobster - which immediately turns the butter a wonderful
orange-pink.

Serve the salmon when it is just cool but still sweet-flavoured and
full of its own juices, with piping hot baked potatoes and warm
lobster butter.
