Skinned, grilled peppers in a garlic and tarragon dressing, arranged
decoratively on a plate, make an elegant, light starter to a meal. Try
using other coloured peppers, too - yellow, purple or white - to vary
the effect.

Wash the peppers and cut into quarters. De-seed and remove the
inedible parts. grill the peppers for a few minutes, skin-side up.
Leave to cool. Now remove the skin, which should peel away easily.
Cut the peppers into strips.

Mix together the garlic, lemon juice, chopped tarragon, and some salt
and pepper and sprinkle over the peppers, trickle the olive oil over
the top and garnish with the sprigs of tarragon.
