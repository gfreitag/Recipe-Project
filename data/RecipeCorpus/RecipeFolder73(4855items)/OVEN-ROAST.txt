Title: OVEN ROAST
Categories: Beef, Main dish, Regional
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Boneless rump or
-eye-of-round roast
1 1/2 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/2 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Seasoned salt
1 ts Pepper
Water
1/4 c  Flour
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Rub roast with Worcestershire sauce and
soy sauce; rub next 3 ingredients into meat. Wrap roast tightly in a
double thickness of aluminum foil or in heavy-duty aluminum foil and
place in a roasting pan. Bake for 3 to 3 1/2 hours or until meat is
very tender. Carefully unwrap roast, pouring drippings into baking
dish. Place roast on a serving platter; keep warm.

Measure drippings; add water to make 3 cups.  Pour into a saucepan,
add flour, and whisk until smooth. Cook over medium heat until thick
and smooth, whisking constantly. Serve with the roast and mashed or
boiled new potatoes.

"Cooking until very tender to us means fall-apart tender."
