Title: PAN-FRIED ABALONE
Categories: Seafood, Shellfish
Yield: 2 Servings
2    Abalone steaks
3 tb Butter
1 tb Oil
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
1 tb Lemon juice
2    Sprigs of Parsley
Recipe by: Fannie Farmer Tenderize the abalone steaks by pounding
with a wooden mallet. Use persistent, firm strikes, and flatten them
to quarter inch thickness. Do not overcook, or the abalone will
become tough and rubbery.  Thirty seconds to a side is enough. Less
is better.

Pat the abalone dry.  Melt the butter with the oil in a large
skillet. When the butter foams and is very hot, add the steaks.
Season with salt and pepper and fry 30 seconds on each side. Transfer
to a warm platter, drizzle with lemon juice and garnish with parsley.
