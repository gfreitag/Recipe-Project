Title: PASTA WITH MUSSELS IN WINE
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Mussels (in their shells)
White wine (enough to fill
-a large shallow saucepan
-about 1/2 an inch)
2 lg Cloves garlic, finely
-chopped
2 tb Olive oil
1 ts Freshly ground pepper
3 tb Chopped fresh basil
1 lg Tomato, coarsely chopped
2 lb Pasta (good with a ribbon
-noodle like linguine or
-fettucini)
Thoroughly wash the mussels, pulling off all beards, and scraping
shells as necessary. Place in saucepan with wine. Cover tightly and
steam until the shells open (don't overcook or they will become
rubbery). Remove mussels with a slotted spoon, leaving the wine broth
in the pan. While the mussels cool a bit, put wine broth over medium
heat and add garlic, olive oil, pepper, tomato, and basil. (Use less
oil to make this low-fat dish even lower in fat). Simmer until
mixture reduces to about 2/3 or half its original volume. While it is
simmering, remove the mussels from their shells. When sauce has
reduced, add mussels to sauce, and simmer another minute. Pour sauce
over hot linguini or fettucini and serve!

This was a great low-fat dinner, and served with a boston lettuce
salad with an olive oil/balsamic vinegar/fresh basil/ground pepper
dressing was just fabulous! You could use shrimp instead of mussels
for a different version too.
