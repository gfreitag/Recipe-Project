Title: PLUMS - HALVED OR WHOLE
Categories: Fruits, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 14 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 9 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
A bushel weighs 56 pounds and yields 22 to 36 quarts--an average of 2
pounds per quart.

Quality: Select deep-colored, mature fruit of ideal quality for eating
fresh or cooking. Plums may be packed in water or syrup.

Procedure: Stem and wash plums. To can whole, prick skins on two
sides of plums with fork to prevent splitting. Freestone varieties
may be halved and pitted. If you use syrup, prepare very light,
light, or medium syrup.

Hot pack -- Add plums to water or hot syrup and boil 2 minutes. Cover
saucepan and let stand 20 to 30 minutes. Fill jars with hot plums and
cooking liquid or syrup, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.

Raw pack -- Fill jars with raw plums, packing firmly. Add hot water or
syrup, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.

Adjust lids and process.

Processing directions for canning plums in a boiling-water, a dial,
or a weighted-gauge canner are given in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.
