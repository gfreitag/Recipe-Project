Title: PARMESAN-CRUSTED LEMON CHICKEN
Categories: Chicken
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Chicken breasts - halves,
-boneless, skinless
5 tb Lemon juice - fresh
2    Eggs
1 1/4 c  Breadcrumbs - dry
1/2 c  Parmesan -grated
2 ts Lemon peel- grated
1/2    Stick butter - (4
-tablespoons)
Lemon wedges
Pound each chicken piece to thickness of 1/2 inch between sheets of
waxed paper.  Place chicken in baking dish. Pour 4 tablespoons lemon
juice over chicken and turn to coat.  Let stand 10 minutes. Beat eggs
with remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice in medium bowl. Combine
breadcrumbs, Parmesan and lemon peel in shallow dish. Dip 1 chicken
breast into egg mixture. Dip into breadcrumbs to coat; gently shake
off excess. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining
chicken, egg mixture and breadcrumbs. [Note from me: Let breaded
chicken sit on wax paper for at least 10 minutes and the coating will
not fall off the meat when sauteeing.]

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high
heat. Add 1/3 of chicken to skillet and saute until golden brown and
cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to platter and
keep warm. Repeat with remaining chicken in 2 more batches, adding 1
tablespoon butter with each batch.  Garnish platter with lemon wedges
and serve.
