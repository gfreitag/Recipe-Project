Title: PEACHES - HALVED OR SLICED
Categories: Fruits, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 17-1/2 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
quarts; an average of 11 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
A bushel weighs 48 pounds and yields 16 to 24 quarts--an average of
2-1/2 pounds per quart.

Quality: Choose ripe, mature fruit of ideal quality for eating fresh
or cooking.

Procedure: Dip fruit in boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds until skins
loosen. Dip quickly in cold water and slip off skins. Cut in half,
remove pits and slice if desired. To prevent darkening, keep peeled
fruit in ascorbic acid solution. Prepare and boil a very light,
light, or medium syrup or pack peaches in water, apple juice, or
white grape juice. Raw packs make poor quality peaches.

Hot pack -- In a large saucepan place drained fruit in syrup, water,
or juice and bring to boil. Fill jars with hot fruit and cooking
liquid, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Place halves in layers, cut side
down.

Raw pack -- Fill jars with raw fruit, cut side down, and add hot
water, juice, or syrup, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.

Adjust lids and process.
