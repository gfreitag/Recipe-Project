Toss all the breading ingredients into a large, tightly-sealed
plastic bag. Seal and shake well to mix. Remove two pieces of chicken
from the ice water. Roll each piece in the yogurt. Put the chicken
into the plastic bag, reseal, and shake to coat thoroughly. Transfer
the breaded chicken to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat the process
until all 12 pieces are breaded. Spray the chicken lightly with the
vegetable oil. Place the baking sheet on the bottom shelf of the oven
and bake for 1 hour, turning pieces every 20 minutes to allow for
even browning. Serve hot or at room temperature.
