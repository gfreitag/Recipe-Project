Title: ONION CUMIN RICE
Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Rice/grains, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Yellow onions; thinly sliced
Olive oil
6    Whole cloves
1/2 ts Red pepper flakes
1 c  Uncooked long-grain rice
3 tb Ground cumin
1 tb Coriander
1 tb Ground ginger
1    Cinnamon stick
Salt; to taste
1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
2 1/2 c  Hot chicken stock
Saute onions in a small amount of olive oil until they are lightly
browned. Push the onions to one side of the pan and pour a little
more olive oil into the middle of the pan. The oil must be hot enough
for the cloves to sizzle when you add them.  Test with one clove
before adding the others. Allow the cloves to sizzle for about 30
seconds, but do not let them scorch.  Add the pepper flakes and rice.
Saute until the rice is lightly colored.  Then add the cumin,
coriander, ginger, cinnamon stick and salt to taste. Combine well and
heat. Add the lime juice and chicken stock, stirring to blend, and
cover the pan.

Cook over the lowest possible heat for 15 minutes, without removing
the lid.  Remove the cinnamon stick and cloves and serve the rice
immediately.

Meras notes that this spicy dish goes well with any grilled fish.
