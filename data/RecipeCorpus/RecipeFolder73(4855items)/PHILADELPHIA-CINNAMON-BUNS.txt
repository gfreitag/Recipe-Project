Title: PHILADELPHIA CINNAMON BUNS
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
6 tb Butter
1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Sugar
2 c  Flour
1 ts Salt
4 ts Baking powder
1    Egg, beaten
1/2 c  Water
2 ts Cinnamon
4 tb Raisins
2 tb Brown sugar *
Melt 4 Tbsp. butter.  Cool.  Sift 2 Tbsp. sugar with flour, salt and
baking powder.  Add beaten egg and 2 Tbsp. of the melted butter to
water, and add slowly to dry ingredients to make soft dough. Knead
lightly. Roll out 1/4" thick on floured board; brush with remaining
melted butter. Mix 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle with raisins
over dough. Roll as for jelly roll.  Refrigerate 1 hour. * Cream 2
Tbsp. butter with 2 Tbsp. brown sugar. Spread this mixture on bottom
and sides of a 2 or 10" cast-iron baking pan (or skillet), and heat
just long enough for butter to melt. Cut dough into 1" pieces and
place with cut edges up on pan, about 1/2" apart. Lots of
cinnamon-sugar will fall out when you cut the buns. Sprinkle this on
top of the pieces in the pan. * As oven heats to 400 degrees, allow
dough to stand 15 minutes. * Bake 25 minutes. Remove from pan at
once, turning upside down to serve.  Buns will expand to form a large
cake. There will be about a dozen buns. Pull apart to eat.
