1 1/2 c  Chicken Stock
2/3 c  White Wine
1 c  Mushrooms; raw, minced

Melt butter and saute onions until golden brown. Stir in flour and
cook, stirring, until the mixture is lightly browned. Gradually stir
in stock, wine , mushrooms, and shrimps. Cook slowly over low heat,
stirring constantly, for 10 minutes. Open oysters and put them in
their deep shells on individual ovenproof baking dishes. A bed of
rock salt will help the shells stand firmly upright. Bake the oysters
in their own juices in preheated moderate oven (350F) for about 6
minutes. Beat egg yolks with cream and beat hot sauce into the
mixture. Reheat the sauce but do not boil. Cover each oyster with
some of the sauce and sprinkle lightly with equal parts of dry bread
crumbs and parmesan cheese. Return the oysters to the oven for about
10 minutes, until the topping is browned.
