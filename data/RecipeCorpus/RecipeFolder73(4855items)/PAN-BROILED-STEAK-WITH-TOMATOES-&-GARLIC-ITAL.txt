Title: PAN-BROILED STEAK WITH TOMATOES & GARLIC-ITAL
Categories: Italy, Low carb, Meats
1/4 c  olive
Yield: 4 Servings
1 ts finely chopped garlic
2 c  seeded sliced tomatoes
1 ts crumbled dried oregano
1 ds freshly ground black pepper
Salt to taste
3 lb beef T-bone, porterhouse or
sirloin steak -- 1
inch thick

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a haevy 8 in skillet over
moderate heat.  Remove the pan from the heat, add the garlic, and
stir for 30 seconds with a wooden spoon. Add the tomatoes, oregano,
1/2 teaspoon of salt and a few grindings of pepper, and cook over
moderate heat, stirring with the wooden spoon.  When the tomatoe
liquid has boiled away, remove the pan from the heat. In a 10 in
skillet, heat the remaining two tablespoons of olive oil.  Over high
heat, brown the steak in the oil for a couple of minutes on each
side. Reduce the heat to moderate and spoon the tomato sauce over and
around the meat. Cover and cook for three to five minutes, or until
the steak is done to your taste. (To test, make a small incision near
the bone, and judge the redness of the meat.) To serve, scrape off
the tomato sauce, and transfer the staek to a carving board. Simmer
the sauce for 1-2 min, scraping in any potcake from the bottom of the
pan. Taste for seasoning.  Slice the staeak and serve with sauce.
