Title: PEACH/CANTALOUPE SOUP WITH BLUEBERRIES
Categories: Digest, July, Soups
Yield: 1 Servings
6    Fresh peaches
1 c  Orange juice
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 lg Cantaloupe
Peel and slice peaches.  Simmer in orange juice with nutmeg (cinnamon
might be good too).  Puree, adding also as you puree: 1/2 large
cantaloupe.

Taste the resulting 'soup'.  Thin with orange juice if it seems too
thick, add a touch of honey or sugar if your fruit wasn't sweet
enough for your taste.   Chill.

Serve garnished with handfuls of fresh blueberries.
