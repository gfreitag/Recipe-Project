Title: PLAINS MUSCADINE JELLY
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 24 Servings
Prepapred fruit
Sugar
Place your grapes in a large enamelized pot and add sufficient water
to cover. Bring slowly to a full boil. Reduce heat and let simmer
until very tender, stirring frequently. Press through a coarse sieve,
to remove skins and seeds, then turn pulp and juice into a jelly bag.
Drain well but do not squeeze the bag or jully will be cloudy.
Measure juice - for each 6 cups of juice add 4-1/2 cups sugar. Set
over high heat and bring to a full boil, stirring constantly. Boil
hard until jelly falls lazily from the spoon in "sheets" (220'F. on
thermometer). Remove from heat and skim. Seal in hot sterilized jars.
