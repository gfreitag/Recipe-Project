Title: OLD-FASHIONED CHEWY DOUBLE GINGER COOKIES
Categories: Biscuits
Yield: 72 Servings
1/2 c  Shortening
1 c  Sugar
2 lg Eggs
1 c  Molasses
3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Ground ginger
1 1/4 ts Baking soda
1 ts Ground cloves
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 c  Fine-chopped crystallized
-ginger
Sugar
In large bowl, cream together shortening and one cup sugar until
light and fluffy.  Beat in eggs one at a time; beat in molasses.

Stir together flour, ground ginger, baking soda, cloves and cinnamon;
stir into creamed mixture in three parts. Mix in crystallized ginger
until smooth.

Remove dough from bowl and wrap in floured wax paper; refrigerate
overnight.  (Dough will be quite soft.)

With lightly floured hands, form dough into 1" (2.5 cm) balls; gently
roll in sugar.  Place about 2" (5 cm) apart on greased baking sheets.

Bake at 350F (180C) for 10 - 12 minutes or just until set. Remove to
wire racks to cool.

Makes about 6 dozen. I'm not much of a cookie baker because it seems
so much effort for something that is gobbled down so quickly, but
these are worth the trouble (I always set some aside for myself, just
to be sure I'll get some). Guten Apetit!
