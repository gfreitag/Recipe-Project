Categories: Appetizers, Main dish
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 lb Ground lamb
1 lg Yellow onion; chopped fine
1 bn Parsley; chopped
1 bn Fresh mint; chopped
1 c  Pine nuts
1/2 c  Fresh lemon juice
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1    Jar grape leaves *
-Water (as needed)
*Note: Grape leaves should be washed and stems removed.

In a large bowl place the lamb, onions, parsley, mint, pine nuts,
lemon juice, olive oil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix the
ingredients together with your hands so that they are well combined.

Lay a grape leaf out flat.  Place approximately 3 ounces of the lamb
mixture in the center of the grape leaf. Fold over the stem end. Fold
over the two sides. Roll up the grape leaf so that the mixture is
completely encased.  Repeat this process until all of the meat
mixture is used.

Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Line the bottom of a large baking dish
with approximately 10 grape leaves.  Place the stuffed grape leaves
in the dish so that they are tightly packed. Cover the stuffed graped
leaves with water and bake them for 1 hour.
