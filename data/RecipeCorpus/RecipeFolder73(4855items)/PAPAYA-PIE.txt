Title: PAPAYA PIE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
4 lb Papaya fruit
1 tb Ground cinnamon
1 tb Ground nutmeg
1 tb Ground pumpkin pie spice
1/2 lb Brown sugar
1 c  White sugar
3    Eggs, beaten
1    9" Pre-made pie shell
-(Graham cracker shell)
Cut fruit meat from skin; cut fruit into chunks. Add sugars, let set
10-15 minutes. Place sugared fruit in a pot large enough to handle,
cook over medium heat until fruit is tender and is easily broken into
smaller pieces, about 30 minutes. Stir occassionally, to keep papaya
from sticking. Add spices about halfway through the cooking process.
When papaya is cooked, allow to cool about 15 minutes, add the beaten
eggs, and place in the pie shell. Bake at 350 deg F for about 45
minutes.
Taste and is similar (sorta) to pumpkin pie.... my opinion. Filling
is similar to the sugary part of pecan pie.
