Title: ORANGE ICE
Categories: Beverages, Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Lemons
9    Oranges
1 1/2 qt Water
4 c  Sugar
1    Egg whites
Juice lemons and oranges, being very careful to extract every seed,
as they cause a bitter taste.  To a syrup made of water and sugar add
juices, and when partly frozen add the meringue of one egg.

When frozen fill in the orange fruit cases ad place in Ice-cream Cave
for three or four hours, and it is then made more delicious by
covering the ice in each case with a meringue and browning quickly
with a red hot salamander, serving immediately. The orange pulp taken
from cases can be used in obtaining juice.
