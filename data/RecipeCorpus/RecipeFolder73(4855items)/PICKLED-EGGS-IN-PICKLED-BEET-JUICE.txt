Title: PICKLED EGGS IN PICKLED BEET JUICE
Categories: Eggs, Pickles
Yield: 1 Servings
1 x  Beets, small young
MMMMM-----------------------------S----------------------------------
2 c  Sugar
2 c  Water
2 c  Vinegar
1 ts Cloves
1 ts Allspice
1 tb Cinnamon
Select small, young beets.  Wash.  Leave 3 inches of tops on and
roots. Cook until skins slip easily (about 15 minutes).
Pack beets into jars within 1/2 inch of top.  Pour boiling liquid
syrup over beets to within 1/2 inch of top of jar. Process for 30
minutes in boiling water bath.
After the beets have had time to "cure" (about 2 months), we then eat
about 1/2 of the beets out of a quart jar, drop hard- boiled eggs
into the pickled beet juice, and put into the refrigerator for about
2 weeks. By then, the beet color will have penetrated into the whites
of the eggs nearly to the yolk area. Of course, a much simpler way
would be simply to buy a large jar of pickled beets, eat about 1/2,
and drop in hard- boiled eggs; then, refrigerate and leave for a
couple of weeks until the beet juice has penetrated.
