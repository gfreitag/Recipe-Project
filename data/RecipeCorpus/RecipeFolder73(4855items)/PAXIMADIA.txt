Title: PAXIMADIA: GREEK WALNUT COOKIE SLICES
Categories: Cookies, Ethnic
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Oil
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3    Eggs
4 c  Flour
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Allspice
1/2 c  Walnuts or almonds chopped
1 ts Anise ( optional )
These are very similar to biscotti but are not necessarily twice
baked. I make this at Christmas time for my Greek friends . Beat oil
and sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time. Combine remaining
ingrdients and mix into creamed mixture with wooden spoon. Form dough
into 4 oval loaves on baking sheet.Score into 1/2 inch slices. Bake
325 for 25 minutes or done. Slice completly through while warm and
cool completely. These freeze well. If you want a harder cookie you
can return just baked cookie to oven, reducing heat 200 and bake 20
minutes longer.
