Title: ORIENTAL STUFFED EGGPLANT
Categories: Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
3 tb Soy sauce
3 tb Water
2 ts Ginger, grated
1 ts Sesame oil, toasted
1 tb Rice vinegar
1/3 lb Tempeh, cut into thin strips
4 ts Vegetable oil
3 ea Japanese eggplants, halved
3 tb Sesame seeds
1 tb Mellow miso
2 tb Mirin
1 ts Ginger, grated
1 tb Water
Preheat oven to 350F.

Combine soy sauce, water, ginger, sesame oil & vinegar in a shallow
glass dish.  Add tempeh & marinate it for several hours. Remove
tempeh & reserve the marinade. Saute the tempeh in 3 ts oil until it
is evenly browned on all sides.  Add reserved marinade & continue to
saute until the liquid has been absorbed.

Brush the cut surfaces of the eggplant with the remaining oil. Bake
until tender, about 15 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to
handle. Scoop out the flesh being careful not to break the skins.
Chop pulp into a mixing bowl.

Lightly toast the sesame seeds in a small skillet over a very low
heat. Stir constantly to prevent burning. When the begin to crackle,
remove from heat & grind ni a mortar & pestle. Place in a large bowl
& mix in the remaining ingredients.  Fold in the tempeh & eggplant
pulp.

Spoon prepared mixture into the eggplant shells & bake until browned
which should take about 20 minutes.
