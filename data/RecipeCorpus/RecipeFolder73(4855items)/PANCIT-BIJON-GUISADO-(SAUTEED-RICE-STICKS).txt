Bring chicken and pork to boiling in 1 1/2 cups water. Reduce heat and
simmer 15 minutes. Remove from heat; when cool enough to handle,
slice meat into small pieces. Reserve the broth. Heat oil in a very
large, wide saute pan. Saute onion and garlic until onion is
transparent. Add meats, shrimp, soy sauce and fish sauce and stir-fry
5 minutes. Over high heat, add cabbage, carrots, celery, salt, pepper
and 1 cup of broth. Stir-fry for 2 minutes. Set aside 1 cup of
mixture. Reduce heat to lowand add rice sticks, stirring and tossing
gently with wooden spoons until heated through and mixed with meat
and vegetables, about 3 minutes. If the mixture seems dry, add more
broth. Transfer to platter, spoon reserved mixture on top and garnish
with chopped scallions, cilantro and egg slices. Squeeze lime over
each serving and sprinkle with additional garnishes. Serve with soy
sauce.
