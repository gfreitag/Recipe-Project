spoon. Gradually add the oil, cream and lemon juice, while beating
constantly. Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste and blend
thoroughly.  Adjust seasoning. Arrange potatoes on a serving platter,
top with the cheese sauce and garnish with the lettuce leaves, eggs

I've tried to make the sauce in my blender but it didn't work to well.
