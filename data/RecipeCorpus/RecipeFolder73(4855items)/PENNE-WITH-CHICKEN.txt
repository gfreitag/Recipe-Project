Title: PENNE WITH CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 lb Boneless chicken breasts
1 1/2 ts Olive oil
1/2 c  Green onion; chopped
3    Garlic cloves; crushed
28 oz Ital. tomatoes; with juice
12    Fresh basil leaves; chopped
1    Can Pitted ripe olives;drain
1/2 ts Hot pepper flakes; crushed
10 oz Penne; or other tube pasta
3 oz Part-skim mozzarella; diced
1 tb Fresh parsley; chopped
1/2 c  Fresh Parmesan; grated
Earlier in the day, add enough water to the skinned chicken to cover
it. Poach chicken in simmering water (uncovered) until chicken is no
longer pink. This will take about 8 minutes. Allow chicken to cool in
poaching liquid. (I put it in the refrig. rather than leave it at
room temp. Cooling it in the liquid makes it more tender) Later,
remove chicken from poaching liquid and chop it into small or
bite-size pieces. Save the poaching liquid to add to the water you're
going to cook the pasta in. In large non-stick pan, cook the onion
and garlic in heated olive oil until softened. Add hot pepper flakes
and tomatoes and juice. Cook about 30 minutes over med. heat until
sauce thickens. Cook penne in poaching liquid with additional water
as needed. Combine chicken with the sauce mixture in serving bowl.
Add parsley and cheese. Sprinkle with parmesan and serve immediately.
