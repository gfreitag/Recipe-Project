Title: PEPPERY MOLASSES CRISPS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 45 Servings
1/2 c  Molasses
3 tb Butter or margarine, cut
Into pieces
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Plain yogurt
"These extremely thin crackers have an intriguing balance of peppery
snap and rich sweetness. They are addictive by themselves and make an
elegant hors d'oeuvre when spread with herbed cream cheese. 350~F. 10
to 15 minutes

Combine the molasses and butter in a small sauce pan. Stir over low
heat until the butter is melted. Remove from the heat and cool
slightly.

In the food processor or a large bowl, combine the flour, pepper, and
salt and mix well. Stir the yogurt into the molasses mixture and then
add to the flour mixture and blend to form a smooth dough.

Remove the dough to a lightly-floured sheet of wax paper or lightly
buttered aluminum foil and shape it into a log or cylinder
approximately 1-1/2 inches thick and 12 inches long. Roll the log in
the wax paper or foil and chill until firm, 45 minutes minimum.

Preheat the oven to 350~F.

When ready to bake, slice the log into 1/4-inch slices. Roll each
slice with a floured rolling pin to form very thin ovals, about 1/16
inch thick. The ovals may stick either to your rolling pin or to your
rolling surface. Gently peel them off. Place the ovals on a lightly
greased or parchemnt-lined baking sheet and prick each one 2 or 3
times with the tines of a fork.

Bake 10 to 15 minutes, until the crackers are medium brown. Those
that are rolled slightly thinner than the others will brown first. Be
ready to remove those from the sheet to cool while the others
continue baking. Cool on racks. The crackers will crispen while
cooling. Yield: 40-45.
