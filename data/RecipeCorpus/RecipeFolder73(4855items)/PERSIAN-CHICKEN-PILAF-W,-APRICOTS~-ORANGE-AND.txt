Chicken Rice Pilaf Mix
**NOTE - Obviously the recipe recommends using Near East Pilaf mix,
but any packaged mix will do. We use the Mahatma Saffron Rice mix,
which is a little less than 6.25 oz, but it still turns out great.
Toss chicken with paprika, cinnamon and cardamom. In large nonstick
skillet, heat 2 Tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken,
cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from skillet, set
aside. In same skillet, heat remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil over medium
heat. Add onion; cook 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in rice
pilaf mix, contents of Spice Sack, broth, apricots, and orange zest;
bring to a boil. Cover; reduce heat to low. Simmer 15 minutes. Stir
in reserved chicken and almonds. Cover; continue to simmer 5 to 10
minutes or until liquid is absorbed.
