Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lg Ears of fresh corn
--cooked
1 tb Unsalted butter
3 oz Lean smoked slab bacon
- preferably apple-smoked,
- diced and blanched
2 lg Onions
-- peeled and finely minced
6 c  Fish bouillon

2 md Russet potatoes

2 c  Flaked smoked bluefish

Cut the corn off the cooked cobs with a sharp knife. You should have
about 2 cups. Set aside.

In a 4-quart casserole, melt the butter over low heat, add the bacon
and saute until lightly browned. Remove with a slotted spoon to a
side dish and reserve.

Discard all but 3 tablespoons of fat from the casserole, add the
onions and cook until soft and lightly browned, about 20 minutes,
stirring often. Add the bouillon and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the
potatoes and simmer until barely tender.

Remove casserole from heat, add the corn and let cool completely. Just
before serving, bring the soup back to a simmer, add the smoked fish
and just heat through. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding a large
grinding of black pepper. Spoon into individual soup bowls, garnish
with parsley or cilantro leaves and serve hot, accompanied by crusty
French bread. 6 SERVINGS.

This delicious interpretation of a classic chowder is the signature
dish of the talented chef of Topper's in Nantucket.
