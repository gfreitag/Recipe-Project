Title: PASSOVER MATZO BALLS
Categories: None, Passover
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Matzo meal
1 tb Potato starch
1/3 c  Water (scant)
1 pn Salt
Mix together and refrigerate 1/2 hour.  Roll into 8 balls and drop
into boiling vegetable broth seasoned-water. Turn down heat and boil
gently for 20 minutes. Remove from water with slotted spoon and bake
for 10 minutes at 350 degrees on lightly Pam-sprayed cookie sheet.
They can be made ahead and refrigerated until use. Do not put cold
matzo balls into warm soup; warm them up first by dunking in hot
water. Serve with vegetable broth.

This makes very small matzo balls, so plan on 3-4 per serving. Each:

Alternate recipe:

SOUP NUTS

Follow the same ingredients preparation as above. Roll into 16 balls.
Boil for 1 minute, then place on sprayed baking sheet and bake for 35
mins. at 400 degrees. If made that day, I don't think these need to
be refrigerated. Calories:  10 each
