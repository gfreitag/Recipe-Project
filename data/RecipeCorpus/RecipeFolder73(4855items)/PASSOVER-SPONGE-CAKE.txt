Yield: 1 Servings
9    Eggs, separated
1 3/4 c  Sugar
3/8 c  Potato starch
1/4 c  Cold water
5/8 c  Cake flour
1/2    Orange-juice and rind
1/2    Lemon-juice and rind
Separate eggs putting whites in mixing bowl and yolks in cold water.
Beat whites by hand or electric mixer until stiff but not dry.
Gradually add sugar.  Add yolks and water mixture and beat well. Add
juices and rinds and beat well.  Add cake flour and starch that have
been mixed with very low mixer or by hand.  Be sure that the flour
mixture is thoroughly blended. Put in Angel Food cake pan and bake

"cook-friendly", easy and quick. You can improvise by adding nuts,
cinnamon-sugar, or other things but the basic recipe is moist and
tasty and wonderful especially as the base for fruits.)
