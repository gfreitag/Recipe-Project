Sift the dry ingredients together. Blend in the lard to form a coarse
mixture. Gradually add the milk until a soft dough is formed. Roll the
dough until it is fairly thin, although it should be thicker than a
regular pie crust. Butter the dough with soft butter, cover with 1/4
inch of brown sugar and sprinkle with cinnamon. Roll the dough up
like a jelly roll and slice into circles about 1/2 inch thick. Pour
water into a casserole dish. Put the sliced dough into the casserole
and bake at 375F for about 30 minutes or until the pets de soeur are
golden brown. VARIATION: Cranberry jam may be substituted for the
sugar and the cinnamon.
