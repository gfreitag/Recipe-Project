Title: PASTINA-STUFFED AVOCADOS
Categories: Salads, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Ripe but firm avocados
1/2 ts Saffron threads
1 c  Pastina (6oz)
2 c  Chicken stock (480ml)
2    Fresh tomatoes, skinned,
-seeded & chopped
2 tb Diced onion
1/4 c  Fresh parsley, chopped
2    Green onions, sliced in
-thin rounds
Salt & pepper
1/2 c  Vinaigrette (120ml)
And, of course, there had to be an avocado recipe in the book...

In El Salvador saffron rice is often served with avocado. I use
pastina here as an alternative to both rice and couscous, and serve
it cold, stuffed into avocado halves. You can use any favorite
vinaigrette in this recipe.

Heat 1/4 cup of chicken stock and steep threads 20 minutes. Cook
pastina in chicken stock with diced onion and steeped saffron. When
cooked, drain and mix well with remaining ingredients. Stuff avocado
halves. Serve as main course at lunch or first course at dinner.
