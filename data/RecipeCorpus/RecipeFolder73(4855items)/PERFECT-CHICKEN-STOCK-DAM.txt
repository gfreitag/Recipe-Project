Categories: Poultry, Soups
Yield: 1 Batch  1. Follow Steps for perfect poached chicken. 2. After removing bones
from chicken, return them to the saucepan and
bring liquid to boil again. Cover, Reduce heat, and let simmer 3-4
hours, set aside. 3. Pour Stock through a strainer into a bowl. 4.
When stock is completely chilled, remove all fat from surface and
discard. 5. Reheat stock just enough ot liquefy and pour into ice
cube trays.
Freeze, then place in sealable plastic bags and keep frozen. 6. Use
frozen chicken stock cubes wherever you want a little added flavor,
such as sauteing chopped onion in a non-stick pan without added
fat,
or when cooking vegetables. 7. Once you have chicken stock cubes
on hand you'll find lots of uses
for them. Note: 1 cup chicken stock cubes used in a day is
equivalent to 1 joker card or 25 optional calories. Keep track and be
honest. If you cheat you just cheat yourself.
