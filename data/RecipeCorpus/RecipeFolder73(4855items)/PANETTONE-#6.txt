Measure carefully, adding ingredients in bread machine pan in the
order recommended by the manufacturer - except cherries, raisins or
currants and almonds.  Select Sweet or Basic/White cycle.  Use Light
or Medium crust color.  Add red and green candied cherries, raisins
or currants, and almonds at the raisin/nut cycle or 5 minutes before
last kneading cycle ends.  The dough becomes VERY SOFT and WET in
appearance at this point! DO NOT add flour, as the bread will become
tough.

Remove baked bread from pan and cool on wire rack. PER SERVING: 260
