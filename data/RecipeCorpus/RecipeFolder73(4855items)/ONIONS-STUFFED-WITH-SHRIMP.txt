6 md Red onions
2 tb Olive oil
1    Green bell pepper; chopped
1 sm Green hot pepper; ribbed,
-seeded, and minced
2    Garlic cloves; minced
3    Tomatoes; peeled and
-coarsely chopped
1/2 lb Tiny or small shrimp; (raw
-best, but cooked and frozen
-also acceptable)
2 tb Coriander; roughly chopped
-(cilantro)
Salt and pepper to taste
3 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
1/4 c  Dry white wine
3/4 c  ;water from cooking the
-onions
1    8-oz can tomato sauce
1/4 c  Dry bread crumbs
Peel the onions and boil in water for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and
cool. Reserve the cooking water. When the onions are cool enough to
handle, scoop out the centers, leaving a shell about 1/4 inch thick.
Set aside the shells and pulp.

Heat the olive oil and saute the bell pepper with the hot pepper
until they are soft.  Add the garlic and cook for only a minute or
two before adding the tomatoes. Continue cooking until most of the
juice evaporates. Stir in the shrimp, coriander, and salt and pepper
and remove from the heat. Stuff the shrimp mixture into the onion
shells and place them in a small ovenproof casserole.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Heat 2 tablespoons butter and saute 1
cup of the reserved onion pulp until the onions are translucent.
Sprinkle with the flour and stir until the mixture browns uniformly.
Immediately add the wine, the reserved water from the onions, and the
tomato sauce. Simmer for about 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens.

Pour the sauce over the stuffed onions.  Sprinkle with the bread
crumbs and dot with the remaining tablespoon of butter broken into
bits. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 15 to 20 minutes or until nicely
browned. Source: Narsai M. David.
