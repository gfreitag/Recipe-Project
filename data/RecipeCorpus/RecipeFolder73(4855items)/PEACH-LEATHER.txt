Categories: Fruits/nuts
Yield: 6 Servings
10 lg Fully ripe peaches
1 c  Sugar
Peel and slice peaches to measure 10 cups. Put peaches in large
saucepan. Add sugar and bring mixture to boil, stirring until sugar
is dissolved. Working in batches, pour mixture into blender or food
processor and puree. Cool to lukewarm. Meanwhile, prepare smooth,
level drying surface in full sunlight. Cover baking sheets,
jelly-roll pans or other flat surfaces with plastic wrap. Pour peach
puree onto prepared surface, spread to 18-inch thickness and let dry
in sunlight. Cover with screen to avoid insects. Drying may take 20
to 24 hours. Bring puree inside at end of day and finish drying
second day. Or set sheets of fruit in baking pans in oven at 150F and
leave door open. Fruit is dry when puree can be peeled off plastic
easily. For storing, roll up leather with plastic wrap. Wrap in more
plastic wrap and seal tightly. Leather will keep at room temperature
about 1 month, in refrigerator about 4 months or 1 year in freezer.
Tear or cut into strips to eat.

apricots and pears, may be substituted for the peaches. Compatible
combinations of fruits also may substituted for a single fruit. Makes
