format by Ursula R. Taylor who got this from Robbie Shelton in the
Oct. 1995 cookbook swap on Delhi - Cust 229.
Combine margarine, mustard, Worcestershire sauce and onions. Split
rolls lentthwise and spread both halves gererously with margarine
mixture.
Cut cheese slices in hal and place on bottom half of roll. Divide
shaved ham equally and place on top of cheese. Put top half of roll
on ham. Wrap each sandwich in foil. Bake at 350~ for 5 minutes. If
sandwiches are frozen, bake at 350~ for 10 to 15 minutes.
These sandwiches can be prepared ahead of time and frozen. Then
relax, knowing they may be heated as needed.
Note:  variations of this sandwich - shaved roast beef or corend
beef are both delicious insted of ham. Poppy seeds may be added to
maragarine for more flavor. And instead of French-style rolls try
whole wheat, onion OR simple hamburger buns.
