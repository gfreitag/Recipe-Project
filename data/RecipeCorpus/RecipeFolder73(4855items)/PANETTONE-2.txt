3 tb Sugar; divided

then gradually beat in sifted flour; beat at high speed for 5

spray. Punch dough down, then turn into prepared mold; bake in middle
of center oven rack for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325
and bake until top is browned and cake begins to pull away from mold,
about 30 minutes longer (cover with foil if Panettone is browning too
quickly). Unmold onto wire rack and let cool.
