Title: PISELLI ALLA TOSCANA
Categories: Vegetables, Side dish, Vegan
Yield: 2 Servings
225 g  Frozen peas
1    Garlic clove
-- finely chopped
2 tb Olive oil
2    Slices of bread
-- crusts removed
Vegetable oil for frying
Salt and pepper
Lightly cooked peas are tossed in olive oil and garlic, and then
mixed with tiny cubes of fried bread. Delicious.

Pour boiling water over the peas and allow to stand for 5 minutes.
Drain. Put them into a pan and cook them with the garlic in the olive
oil over a gentle heat for 3 minutes. Add a little water and turn the
heat up for another minute or two, then season with salt and pepper.

Cut the bread into tiny dice and fry in vegetable oil until golden all
over. Drain, and dry on kitchen paper. Toss these croÂ–tons into the
peas and serve immediately.
