Recipe by: "Chili Madness" by Jane Butel (Queen of Chili) Melt lard,
butter, or drippings in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add the
onions and cook until transparent but not browned, about 5 minutes.
Combine meat with garlic, ground chilis and cumin.
Add this meat-spice mixture with a fork and cook, stirring
occasionally, until meat is evenly browned. Stir in water and salt.
Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 2
1/2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally, until meat is very tender and
flavors are well blended. Add more water if necessary. Taste and
adjust seasonings.

Serves 6.
