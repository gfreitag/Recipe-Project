Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
4    To 4-1/2 cups all-purpose
-flour
2 pk Dry yeast
1/3 c  Non-fat dry milk
1 1/2 c  Hot tap water (120 - 130
-degrees)
2 tb Shortening, room temperature
2 tb Sugar
1 pk Onion soup mix (1-3/8
-ounces)
2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
1    Egg, room temperature
You will need two medium baking pans (greased or Teflon) or one baking
sheet (greased or Teflon).  If glass pans are used, reduce oven heat
by 25 degrees.

In a large mixer bowl combine 2 cups of flour and the yeast. In a
saucepan measure milk, water, shortening, sugar, soup mix, and
cheese. Stir over a low heat until warm (120 degrees). Pour this into
the dry mixture, add the egg and beat at a low speed in the electric
mixer for 30 seconds. Scrape down bowl. Turn mixer to high for three
minutes. Stop the mixer, and with a wooden spoon gradually stir in
more flour to form a soft dough that will clean the sides of the bowl.

Kneading:

Sprinkle the work surface with flour and turn the dough onto it, Knead
until the dough is smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with the
inverted bowl and let it rest on the counter top for twenty minutes.

Shaping:

To make two twist loaves, divide the dough into 4 parts. Shape each
piece into a smooth 12 inch roll. Twist 2 pieces together and press
ends to seal. Tuck under the sealed ends, place loaf in prepared pan.
Loaves can also be baked on a baking sheet.  Place them 2 inches
apart.

Rising:

Cover with wax paper or foil until doubled in size (about 45 minutes).
Dough will rise to about 1/2 inch above the edge of the pan.

Baking:

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake in oven until the crusts have
browned. The loaves will draw away from the sides of the pan. When
tapping, the bottom crust yields a hard, hollow sound, the bread is
done. Remove bread from the oven.  Turn out on metal cooling racks.
Brush with melted butter for a nice soft finish.
