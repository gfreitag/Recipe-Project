Sushi, a representative food of Japan, is a vinegared rice garnished
with an assortment of fresh vegetables, fish and seasonings. You'll
find many of the ingredients ... and the bamboo mat ... at an
Oriental food store.

RICE:

Cook rice in water for about 25 minutes or until all the liquid is
absorbed. Spread rice evenly over bottom of a large glass or wooden
bowl.

Mix vinegar, sugar and salt together in a small bowl.

Sprinkle vinegar mixture generously over the rice. You may not need
all the vinegar mixture. The rice should remain somewhat dry.

With a large wooden spoon, mix rice with a slicing motion.

Leave the rice in the bowl, covered with a damp cloth.

ROLLS:

1 pk Nori Seaweed, large or medium (Quality nori seaweed must be
crisp. Look for a well-sealed package.) 1 Bamboo Mat, medium or
large, for rolling sushi

FILLINGS ... Chose from these combinations:

1    Cucumber, cut into thin strips the same length as seaweed 1
Avocado, peeled, pitted and cut into thin strips Fresh Cilantro,
minced

2 oz Daikon Radish, cut into strips 2 oz Pickled Ginger 4 oz Small
Shrimp, cooked

4 oz Prosciutto 1 Cucumber, cut into thin strips 1 Avocado, peeled,
pitted and cut into thin strips 2 oz Pickled Ginger

TO ASSEMBLE SUSHI ROLLS:

Place one sheet of nori seaweed on the bamboo mat.

Spread approximately 3/4 cup rice onto seaweed; flatten with the back
of a spoon.  Leave uncovered 3/8 inch (1 cm) at front of sheet and
3/4 inch (2 cm at end of sheet.

Place all filling ingredients at center.

To form roll, lift one end of the mat and begin to roll and compress
the seaweed.  Use the mat only to help form the roll. (It may be
difficult at first to keep the mat from rolling with the seaweed.)

Moisten end of seaweed with a small amount of water to seal the roll.

Cut into rounds approximately 1/2 inch thick.
