Categories: Pate', Apples, Appetizers
Yield: 10 Servings
1 c  Butter
1/2 c  Onions; chopped
2 tb Shallots; chopped
1/4 c  Apples; chopped, peeled
1 lb Chicken livers; halved
1/4 c  Apple wine or brandy
3 tb Whipping cream
1 ts Lemon juice
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/2 c  Butter; clarified
Apple slices (optional)
Soften 10 tablespoons butter and set aside. Melt 3 of remaining
tablespoons butter in skillet. Add onions and shallots. Cook until
tender, stirring, about 5 minutes. Add chopped apples and cook until
tender, about 3 minutes. Place apple mixture in blender. Melt
remaining 3 tablespoons butter in skillet. Add chicken livers and
stir 3 to 4 minutes until livers are browned outside and pink inside.
Add wine and cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Transfer liver mixture
to blender with apple mixture. Add 2 tablespoons cream and blend at
high speed until smooth. Add more cream, if necessary, to make
mixture smooth. Press through medium-fine strainer into mixing bowl.
Cool thoroughly, stirring once or twice. (Pate will become oily if
not completely cooled.) In another bowl, cream 10 tablespoons
softened butter with electric mixer and add liver mixture, a little
at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in lemon juice,
salt and pepper. Pour pate into crock or ramekins, smoothing top with
spatula. Pour enough clarified butter over top to form seal. Store in
refrigerator up to 1 week or freeze, in appropriate containers, if
desired. Serve chilled and garnished with apple slices, if

desired.
