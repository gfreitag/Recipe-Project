(This is much easier to do if the meat is partially frozen). If meat
is partly frozen, allow to thaw and then dry the meat. Combine
sherry, soy sauce and cornstarch; pour over the meat, stirring to
coat. Heat 2 tb. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium high
heat. Add mushrooms and pea pods; stir-fry 3 to 4 minutes. Remove
vegetables; reserve. Drain marinade from beef and reserve. Add
remaining oil to the skillet. Stir-fry beef strips (1/2 at a time), 1
to 2 minutes. Return vegetables, beef and marinade to the skillet;
cook and stir until sauce thickens. Serve beef mixture over the
lettuce. Garnish with the noodles and pepper slices if desired.
