Carrots are a good source of vitamin A, while baked potatoes are a
natural carbohydrate.

Sweet butter (or better yet, plain yogurt) Mother's milk, formula
(optional)

Scrub potato, puncture it with a fork and place in preheated, 450
degree oven for 45-60 minutes until done.

Meanwhile, scrub and chop carrot and steam in a few inches of water
until tender.

Mash potato and carrot together with a small amount of butter or
yogurt and warm milk if desired. Refrigerate leftovers.
