Meanwhile, pour boiling water over bean sprouts; let stand one minute.
Drain; cool under cold water and drain well.

Thoroughly toss chicken mixture with bean sprouts, green onions and
walnuts.

Place about 1/2 cupful of chicken mixture in center of each parchment
square.  Fold bottom point of parchment over filling; crease just
below filling and fold point over and under filling. Fold side points
over filling, overlapping slightly.  Crease paper to hold folds. Fold
remaining corner down so point extends below bottom of bundle; tuck
this point between folded sides. Crease paper to hold folds. Repeat
with remaining parchment squares. (Ends up looking like small
envelope, with flap tucked under bundle)

Place bundles seam side down, in single layer on steamer rack. Set
rack in large pot or wok of boiling water. (Do not let water level
reach the bundles) Cover and steam about 7 minutes or until chicken
is tender. Serve immediately
