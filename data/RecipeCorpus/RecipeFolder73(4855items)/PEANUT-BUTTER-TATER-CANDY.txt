Title: PEANUT BUTTER TATER CANDY
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Servings
-Helen Jolly mdfd30e-
1 md White potato
1 pk Confectioners' sugar
1/4 c  Salted peanuts; chopped,
- optional
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Smooth peanut butter
Boil potato (with skin on) until done.  Peel; remove any eyes or
spots.
In a mixing bowl, mash the potato thoroughly with a fork or
electric mixer at slow speed.  Add vanilla. Gradually add
confectioners' sugar ((use a fork, as mixture begins to firm) until
it forms a ball. Turn out on a confectioners' sugar covered surface
(instead of flour). Roll the ball out flat and oblong until it is
1/4-inch thick.
Spread peanut butter evenly over the flat surface. Sprinkle the
chopped peanuts evenly over peanut butter (if you opt to use them).
Cut the flat surface in half the short way. Roll jelly-roll fashion,
sealing the edges. (2 rolls.)   Place in refrigerator until chilled
and firm. Slice into 1/3-inch pieces. Keep refrigerated until ready
to serve.
