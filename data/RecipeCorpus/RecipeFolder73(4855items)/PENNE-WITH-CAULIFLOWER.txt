4 tb Olive oil
25 g  Raisins; soaked in

An unusual combination of tastes makes this a pasta dish with a
difference - raisins and pine nuts give it a quite distinctive
quality. Serve it with a tossed green salad.

Steam the cauliflower florets 'al dente'. Cut them into thin slices.
Saute the onion in the oil over a moderate heat until it begins to
brown. Simmer, partially covered, for 5 minutes. Stir in the raisins,
pine nuts and cauliflower and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Toss the cooked penne with half of the sauce and spoon the rest over
the top. Sprinkle the dish with the grated cheese and garnish with
the parsley. Serve hot, on warmed plates.
