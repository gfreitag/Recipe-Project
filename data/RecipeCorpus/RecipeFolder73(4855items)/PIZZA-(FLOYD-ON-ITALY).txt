Title: PIZZA (FLOYD ON ITALY)
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Plain FLour
1 oz Fresh Yeast, dissolved in
-warm water
1 ts Salt
1/2 pt Hand-hot water
Sift the flour on to a work surface and make a well in the middle.
Pour the dissolved yeast into the well, add the salt and mix. Bit by
bit add the warm water, kneading all the time to make a soft, pliable
dough. Knead dough until it is light and elastic, then form into four
balls. Put them on to floured plates, cover and leave in a warm place
to prove (rise) for about 1 hour. Roll out dough balls into circles
12 inches in diameter. Drizzle a little olive oil over the surface of
each and top with ingredients of your choice. Bake for 12-15 minutes
in the oven at it's highest temperature, on a flat metal baking tray
that's been preheated, so that the base cooks crisply.
