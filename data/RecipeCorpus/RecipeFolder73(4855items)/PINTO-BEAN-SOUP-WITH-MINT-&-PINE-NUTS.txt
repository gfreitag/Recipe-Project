Salt
1 c  Half and half

Soak beans overnight; drain.  Transfer to a large soup pot and cover
the beans with fresh water.  Bring to a boil for 5 minutes, then
drain and rinse them.

Warm the oil in the soup pot, add the onion and chile and briefly cook
together.  Next add the beans and 10 cups of water; bring to a boil.
Simmer until beans are tender, about 45 minutes for new beans, longer
for older beans.  Season to taste with salt, then continue cooking
until they are completely soft.

Puree half the beans and cooking liquid at a time in the blender until
smooth.  Return the puree to the pot. Add cream and reheat. Chop
toasted pine nuts finely. Stir in the chopped herbs, reserving some
of the chives. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with remaining
chives and the pine nuts.
