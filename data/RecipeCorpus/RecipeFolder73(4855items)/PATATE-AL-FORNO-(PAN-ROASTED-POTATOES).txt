Title: PATATE AL FORNO (PAN-ROASTED POTATOES)
Categories: Side dishes
Yield: 6 Servings
18 sm New potatoes
6 tb Butter
Paprika
Salt
Fresh ground pepper
Boil potatoes in the jackets until barely tender. Drain. Melt the
butter in a baking dish large enough to hold the potatoes. As soon as
they are cool enough to handle, peel the potatoes and place them in a
dish. Sprinkle with paprika and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Bake in a 350 F oven for about 15 minutes, shaking the pan
occasionally so the potatoes are coated with butter.

Serves 6.
