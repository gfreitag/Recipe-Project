Title: ONION FOCCACIA
Categories: Bakery, Italian, Breads, Snacks, Mark's
Yield: 1 Foccacia
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1/2 tb Yeast
1 c  Lukewarm water
1/2 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
2 ts Rosemary, ground
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Wheat germ
3 c  Flour
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
3 md Onions, diced
1 1/2 tb Olive oil
Salt & pepper
Olive oil, for brushing
In a mixing bowl, combine the yeast, water, sugar, salt, oil &
rosemary. Let stand until the yeast starts to froth. Mix in the wheat
germ & 1 c flour.  Beat well & let sit for 5 minutes. Knead in the
remaining flour & knead until the dough is soft & pliable. Lightly
oil a clean bowl & cover with a towel.  Let rise until doubled in
bulk.

Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet & saute the onions, reduce
heat to low & cook until the onions begin to caramelize. Remove from
heat & set aside. Preheat oven to 350F.

Roll out the dough to fit into a cookie sheet or on a pizza stone.
Lightly sprinkle the cookie sheet with cornmeal & place the dough on
the sheet. Stretch into the corners & build up the edges slightly.
Let rest for 10 minutes.

Brush the dough with olive oil & spread the onions over the top.
Generously salt & grind fresh black pepper over the top. Bake for 25
minutes or until the crusts are done. Cut up & serve immediately or
let cool. This is equally good cold & served at room temperature.

NOTE: I thought this recipe was from "Friendly Foods" by Ron
Pickarski, & it is not.  It is also not in Carol Field's "Italy in
Small Bites", so if someone has the source for this recipe I'll
gladly give it the credit. In the meantime, this is what I do for
onion foccacia & I guess it comes from my head each time.
