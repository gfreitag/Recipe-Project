Categories: Main, Dish
Yield: 4 Servings
3 tb Vegetables oil
4    To 4 1/2 pounds oxtails
4    Celery stalks, chopped
2    Carrots, chopped
2    Leeks, chopped (white and
-pale green parts only)
1    Onion chopped
6    Garlic cloves, chopped
1    750-ml bottle dry red wine
12    Sprigs fresh thyme
12    Sprigs fresh parsley
8    Whole cloves
4    Bay leaves
5 c  Chicken stock or canned
-low-salt broth
2 tb All purpose flour
Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over high heat. Season oxtails
with salt and pepper. Add to Dutch oven and cook until brown on all
sides, about 12 minutes. Transfer oxtails to platter. Add celery,
carrots, leeks, onion and garlic to pot and saut√© until golden brown,
about 8 minutes. Arrange oxtails over vegetables. Add wine, thyme,
parsley, cloves and bay leaves. Boil until liquid is reduced by half,
about 15 minutes. Add stock. Bring to boil. Reduce heat. Cover Dutch
oven tightly and simmer until meat is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours.

Remove oxtails from cooking liquid. Tent with foil to keep warm.
Strain cooking liquid. Skim fat from surface and reserve. Transfer 2
tablespoons skimmed fat to heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.
Add flour and stir until mixture browns, about
10    minutes. Whisk in cooking liquid. Simmer until sauce
thickens enough to coat back of spoon and is reduced to 2 cups,
stirring frequently, about 45 minutes. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Return oxtails to sauce, cover
and refrigerate.)

Rewarm oxtails in sauce over low heat. Transfer to large bowl and
serve.
