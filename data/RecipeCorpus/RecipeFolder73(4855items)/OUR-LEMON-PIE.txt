Categories: Diabetic, Desserts, Pies
Yield: 8 Servings
3 tb Margarine;
10    Graham cracker squares;
1/2 c  Skimmed evaporated milk;
-cold
1 pk Dream Whip;
27 pk Equal sweetener;
2    Egg yolks;
2 lg Lemons; 1/2 cup juice
3    Egg whites;
3 tb Sugar;
Melt margarine on medium to low heat.  Roll graham crackers into
crumbs with rolling pin.  Mix crumbs and melted margarine. Pat to
make crust on bottom and sides of pie pan. Chill.

Add cold evaporated milk to Dream Whip (do not add vanilla). Sprinkle
in 24 pkg. Equal.  Mix and beat according to directions. Beat egg
yolks slightly, and gradually stir in lemon juice. Gradually fold in
the whipped Dream Whip.  Spread in pie crust.  Turn on broiler so it
will get hot. Beat 3 egg whites frothy (use clean beaters so whites
will beat up as fluffy as possible).  Add 1 tbs. sugar and beat until
blended in. Add another tbs. sugar and 3 Equal pkg. and beat until
soft peaks form. Spread meringue over top. Spread meringue to stick
to the edges so it won't shrink when you broil it.

Put under broiler for 30-60 seconds until meringue is lightly
browned. IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG AT ALL AND IS EASY TO BURN. The flavors
will blend better if you chill for 5 hours.
