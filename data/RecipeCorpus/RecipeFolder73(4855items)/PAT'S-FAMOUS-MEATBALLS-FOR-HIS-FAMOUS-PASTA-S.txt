Title: PAT'S FAMOUS MEATBALLS FOR HIS FAMOUS PASTA S
Categories: Italian, Meats
Yield: 24 Meatballs+
4 1/2 lb Ground chuck or lean beef
2    Eggs
1 tb Garlic salt
1 tb Italian seasoning
3 c  Or more Italian bread crumbs
3/4 c  Or more Grated Romano cheese
In a very large bowl, add all ingredients except the cheese. The
mixture will be very very dry (this is good, as the crumbs will ab-
sorb any fats in the sauce!). Mix well. Add the cheese. Form
meatballs to the size you desire and saute all sides until just
brown. Drop in the sauce you are making. This recipe will make 24 +/-
"larger than golf-ball size", or smaller, depending on your desires.
