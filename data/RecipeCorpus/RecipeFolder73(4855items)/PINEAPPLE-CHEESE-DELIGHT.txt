Beat egg yolks and sugar till light and lemon-colored. Add the

speed till batter is smooth. Do not over beat. Fold in lemon rind.
Set aside.

Beat whites and sugar till soft peaks form. Fold the egg yolk mixture
into the beaten egg whites. Fold the cheese into the batter. Pour
into a 10" x 4" tube pan. Bake in a preheated oven at 350F for about
55 minutes or until cake tester comes out clean. Invert pan and let
cool.

In a clean saucepan (not greasy nor wet), mix sugar and egg whites.
Cook slowly over low flame. Stir with clean wooden spoon so mixture
will not stick to your cooking pan. When sugar has melted, transfer
to mixing bowl. Beat at high speed. Add lemon flavor, lemon juice and
yellow color. Frosting should stand and have soft peaks but not dry.
Frost sides and top of cake. Granish with red cherries and finely
chopped walnuts.
