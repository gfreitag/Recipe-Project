In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour with the Parmesan, salt
and pepper.  Make a well in the center and add the eggs and 1/4 cup
of water. Beat the eggs and water together and gradually incorporate
the flour mixture to form a smooth batter.  Add 1/8 teaspoon of the
Tabasco and set aside to rest for 30 minutes. In another bowl,
combine the mayonnaise, lemon juice, lemon zest, garlic, thyme, olive
oil and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon Tabasco. Whisk to blend and set
aside for at least 30 minutes. (The recipe can be prepared to this
point up to 1 day ahead. Refrigerate the batter and mayonnaise. If
the batter becomes very thick, thin it out with a little water.)
Preheat the oven to 250F. In a large skillet, heat the peanut oil
over moderately high heat to 350F. Dredge the crabs in the remaining
1 cup flour and shake off the excess. Dip 4 of the crabs in the
batter, let some of the batter drip off, and then fry them in the
skillet, turning once, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Drain on paper towels, place on a heatproof platter and keep warm in
the oven. Repeat with the 4 remaining crabs. Scoop out some of the
bread from the center of the rolls to hollow them slightly. Spread 2
heaping teaspoons of the mayonnaise on each half. Assemble the
sandwiches by placing 2 or 3 slices of tomato and 4 or 5 arugula
leaves on the bottom half of each roll. Set the fried crabs on top
and close the sandwiches. Serve immediately. Serves 8. Recipe from
Food & Wine, June, 1991.
