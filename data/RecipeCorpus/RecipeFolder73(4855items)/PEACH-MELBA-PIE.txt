1.  Preheat oven to 425 F.  Slice peaches into 1/2-inch-thick wedges.
They should measure about 4 cups. Place in a large bowl with
raspberries. Measure sugar, flour, cinnamon and nutmeg into a small
bowl. Stir with a fork until blended.  Add to fruit and stir until
evenly distributed.

2.  Roll out half the pasttry and fit into a 9-inch pie plate without
stretching dough.  Do not trim edge until top dough is in place. Do
not prick bottom. Then roll out remaining dough into a 10-inch
circle, about 1/8 inch thick.

3.  Pour filling into pie shell.  Dot with butter. Moisten edge of
pastry with water.  Place 10-inch circle of pastry over filling.
Gently press seams together to seal. Trim dough to 1/2 inch beyond
tim of plate. Then turn edge underneath and flute rim. Cut 2 or 3
(2-inch) slits on top crust to allow steam to escape.

4.  Make a glaze, if you wish, by whisking egg together with milk in a
small bowl.  Brush evenly over pie crust. Place pie on bottom rack of
preheated 425 F oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until pastry
starts to turn golden.  Then redue oven heat to 350 F and continue
baking 45 to 50 minutes or until peaches can easily be pierced with a
fork.
