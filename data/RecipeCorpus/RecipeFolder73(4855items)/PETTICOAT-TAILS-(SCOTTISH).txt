Title: PETTICOAT TAILS (SCOTTISH)
Categories: Breads, Scottish
Yield: 12 Servings
8 oz Flour
4 oz Cornflour or Rice Flour
4 oz Butter
4 oz Icing Sugar
Caster Sugar for Dredging
Set the oven to 350F/Gas 4. Grease a baking sheet. Cream the
:
butter and icing sugar together in a bowl. Sift in the flours and
work into a smooth dough; if the dough is too dry a little water can
be added to moisten. Divide into two. Roll out on a floured surface
and shape into two thin rounds. Place on the sheet and prick all over

minutes until pale golden in colour. Sprinkle with the caster sugar
while still warm. Cut into the triangles and cool on a wire rack.
