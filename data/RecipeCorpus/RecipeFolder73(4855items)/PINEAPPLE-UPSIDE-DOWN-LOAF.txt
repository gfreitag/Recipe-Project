Title: PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN LOAF
Categories: Breads, Holiday
Yield: 6 Servings
8 oz Pineapple rings, drained
4    Maraschino cherries, halved
2 pk Coffee cake mix (10.5 ozs.
-each)
2    Eggs
1 c  Milk, divided
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously butter the bottom and sides
of an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Cut pineapple rings in half. Place
4 pineapple-ring halves decoratively on the bottom of the prepared
pan, and the remaining 4 halves standing along the long side of the
pan. Place cherry halves, cut-side-down, in the center indentations
of the pineapple-halves. Sprinkle bottom and sides of the pan with 1
1/2 packets of the crumb mixture from coffee-cake mix. Discard
remaining crumb mixture. Prepare bags of coffee-cake mix with eggs as
package directs, but use the milk instead of water called for.
Squeeze batter from both bags gently over streusel, pineapple, and
cherries. Let stand 10 minutes. Tap pan gently on counter to release
any air bubbles. Bake 40 to 50 minutes, or until a wooden pick
inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool on a wire rack for
20 minutes. With a long, serrated knife, cut the top of the bread
level with the top of the pan. Invert bread onto a serving plate
while warm. To serve, cut with a sharp (not serrated) knife.
