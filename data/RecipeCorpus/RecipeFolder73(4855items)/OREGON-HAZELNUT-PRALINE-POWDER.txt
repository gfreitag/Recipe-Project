Title: OREGON HAZELNUT PRALINE POWDER
Categories: Candy, Condiments
Yield: 2 Cups
1 c  Roasted Oregon hazelnuts
-(whole)
3/4 c  Sugar
3 tb Light corn syrup
3 tb Water
1/4 ts Salt, optional
Butter a cookie sheet lightly. Spread the roasted Oregon hazelnuts on
it and place them in a 250-degree oven to warm through. Leave them
for 10 minutes, shaking the pan once or twice. Turn off oven, open
the door, and leave the pan in it. Combine sugar, corn syrup and
water in a small heavy saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil over high
heat; after boiling starts, wipe down with wet pastry brush any sugar
crystals on the sides of the pan. Boil the syrup until it begins to
turn a light caramel color; it will register between 320 and 340
degrees on a candy/jelly thermometer. Remove from heat and quickly
add the salt, and the warmed nuts. Stir the mixture quickly (it
hardens fast!),then pour it onto the buttered cookie sheet that held
the nuts; spread it out with a wooden spoon or spatula. Cool the
brittle completely, then break it into small pieces. Working in
batches, grind it into a fine powder in a food processor or blender.
Store the Praline Powder in an airtight container Will keep several
months at room temperature, or at least 2 years in freezer.
