Drain beans and use the liquid to boil the meat for about 2 hours at
low heat.  Add about 1-2 teaspoon of salt (to taste!). You get a
better stock when you put the meat in the cold liquid, heat to boil
and then continue cooking slowly. Peel potatoes and boil until done.
You needn't add salt because the beef broth will be salty enough.
Reserve the water as well; you may need it to add to the stew when it
turns out to thick. Take the meat out of the broth after two hours
and cut it apart. You should add the lean parts to the stew. Now add
the drained beans. Mash the potatoes and add them as well.  When you
are lazy you might use instant potato puree, but that's not quite as
good as the real thing. Heat the stew while stirring well.  If you
consider it too thick add a bit of the reserved potato water. (BTW,
the right consistency *is* rather thick!) Season to taste with
savory, pepper and salt. Optionally you can add a cube of beef stock,
although that isn't really necessary (my Mom does, my Granny
doesn't...). I like to season the bean stew with vinegar, but this is
also a matter of taste.  Just try and experiment a bit!
