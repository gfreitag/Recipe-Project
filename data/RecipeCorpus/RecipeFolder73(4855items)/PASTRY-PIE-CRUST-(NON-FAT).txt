Categories: Misc
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Flour
1/3 c  Corn syrup
2 tb Milk, skim
Preheat oven to 475.  Combine dry ingredients and liquids separately.
Then sprinkle liquid mixture over dry mixture, combining with fork
until mass will hold together. Do not overwork dough. Form dough into
ball and roll out on floured surface, or roll out between two pieces
of floured waxed paper. Place circle of dough in pie pan. Ease down
into pan without stretching.  Trim off any edges that hang over. If
baking unfilled, prick bottom and sides with fork and bake 10
minutes. If baking filled, use baking times with recipe. To prevent
edge crust on top of pie from getting too brown, place foil over
exposed top of crust while it bakes until last ten minutes. Makes one
crust.
