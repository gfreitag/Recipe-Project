Coarse salt
The sauce: Finely chop onion, celery, garlic, carrots and parsley
together on a board or in a food processor. Cut pancetta into small
pieces.

Heat the oil in a terra-cotta or enamel saucepan. When hot, add the
chopped ingredients and pancetta and saute slowly over low heat for
about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Mix in
ground beef and when it is no longer reddish, add wine and let it
evaporate for about 5 minutes.

Pass the tomatoes through a food mill to remove seeds and, when the
wine has evaporated, add tomatoes to the saucepan. Taste for salt and
pepper and simmer slowly for about 25 minutes.

Dolce-forte: Put all 5 ingredients in a small bowl and set aside for
about 20 minutes. When the meat sauce is ready, add the dolce-forte
to the saucepan. Stir to incorporate and simmer 5 minutes longer.

The pasta: You can make it by hand, of course, but this seems the
simpler way. Place ingredients in a food processor with the metal
blade and pulse on and off until a ball of dough forms. Turn out,
gently knead into a ball, cover with a towel and let rest about 1/2
hour. Divide dough into quarters and knead until smooth by putting
through pasta machine rollers, starting with widest setting and
working down to the last setting (pasta will be very, very thin). Cut
into tagliatelle (the wider cutter) and let stand on a board, loosely
covered with a clean towel, until needed (do not let dry out).

Bring a large pot of cold water to a boil. Add coarse-grained salt to
taste. Prepare a warmed serving dish by spreading 1 cup of the sauce
over the bottom.

Add the pasta to the boiling salted water and cook for about 30
seconds after the water has returned to a boil. Drain and put in
prepared serving dish. Pour remaining sauce over pasta and toss very
well. Serve immediately.
