Title: OVEN FRIED FISH
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Fat-free crackers processed
-to fine crumbs (or fat free
-bread crumbs)
1/4 ts Dry mustard powder
1    Egg white
2 tb Non-fat milk
1 lb Fish filets of choice
-(orange roughy or other
-mild white fish)
Lemon wedges (optional)
Preheat oen to 425.  Process crackers into fine crumbs using a food
processor or blender.  Stir dry mustard into crumbs. Beat egg white
with milk in a broad, shallow bowl. Spread cracker crumbs on a plate.

Dip fish filets one at a time into egg white mixture, then place in
cracker crumbs and turn to coat all surfaces. Bake 15 minutes, until
coating is crisp and fish flakes easily with a fork.

Serve with lemon wedges, if desired.

The book reccomends making this with Health Valley Fat Free Herb
crackers, but I just used the Premium fat free crackers that I
already had. I think it would be better with the herb crackers
because it was very bland with the plain crackers.  The fish had a
nice "non-fishy" flavor though, which my hubby said was greatly
improved with lemon pepper.
