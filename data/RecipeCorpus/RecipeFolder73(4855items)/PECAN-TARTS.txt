To make tart shells place flour, cold butter, 3 tablespoons sugar and
salt in food processor. Process, using quick on and off motion, until
mixture resembles coarse meal. Combine 2 egg yolks and 1 tablespoon
cream in small bowl. With motor running, add egg mixture to flour
mixture. Process just until dough begins to form. Add enough
remaining cream to form dough that holds together. Scrape dough onto
piece of foil. Wrap airtight and refrigerate until well chilled, at
least 1 hour. Divide dough into 6 or 8 equal portions, depending on
whether pan size is 3 or 4 inches. Roll each portion out onto lightly
floured pastry cloth. Carefully transfer pastry to tart pans. Press
against bottoms and sides of pans, then trim excess around rims. If
pastry tears, patch with small bits of pastry trimmings. Reserve any
remaining pastry, wrapped airtight, for another use. Refrigerate
pastry-lined tart pans until ready to use.

To make sauce, heat 1/2 cup sugar in small, heavy skillet or saucepan
over medium heat until melted and medium amber in color. Carefully
pour in 2/3 cup cream all at once, being careful to avoid splatters.
Stir in 2 tablespoons butter. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium
heat until caramel dissolves and sauce is smooth. Remove from heat.
Store at room temperature if not using immediately, as sauce will
harden if refrigerated.

To make filling, combine corn syrup, 3/4 cup each sugar and brown
sugar, 4 eggs and 2 egg yolks in medium bowl. Stir until blended.
Heat 3 tablespoons butter in small skillet over medium heat until
butter is foamy and light brown in color. Remove from heat and whisk
into corn syrup mixture.

To assemble tarts, set pastry-lined tart pans on large baking sheet.
Divide pecans among tart pans and pour filling over them or pour in
filling and arrange pecans on top in symmetrical pattern. Bake at
375F 35 to 40 minutes. Remove to wire rack to cool. Serve tarts at
room temperature topped with caramel sauce. Makes 6 to 8 tarts
