orange thinly. Plunge peaches into a large pot of boiling water for
10 seconds. Remove peaches with slotted spoon and plunge in bowl of
ice water. Peel and set aside. Repeat this blanching and chilling
process with the orange slices and set aside. Using a medium-heavy
saucepan and medium heat, combine sugar and vinegar and heat until
sugar is dissolved. Add bag of spices and peaches and cook over low
heat for 8 minutes, then remove with slotted spoon and divide between
2 or 3 two-cup glass preserving jars. Add orange slices to the same
sugar mixture and cook over low heat for 5 minutes, then remove with
slotted spoon and add equal amounts to each of the jars of peaches.
Discard spice bag and boil syrup over medium heat for 4 - 5 minutes.
Pour over fruit in jars. Let cool, then seal shut. Store in a cool
place for up to 1 month, then refrigerate. Serve with roast pork,
goose or ham. Makes from 2 to 3 pints.
