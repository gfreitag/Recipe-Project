Yield: 2 Servings
8 oz Pasta, homemade or store-
Bought
1/2 c  Heavy cream
4 oz Cooked salmon, cubed or in
Rather large pieces
Pepper to taste
4 oz Fontina cheese, diced
Set a large pot of cold water to boil.  When it reaches a full boil,
toss in a pinch of salt, and when the water returns to a boil, start
cooking the pasta. In the meantime, in a saucepan heat the cream,
salmon, and pepper for a few minutes. When the pasta is al dente,
drain well and return to its pot.  Immediately toss on the cubes of
Fontina and pour on the cream sauce. Heat thoroughly for a few
moments, tossing so that the Fontina melts into creamy strands. Serve
immediately.
