"This syrup is delicious with fruits, in a marinade for chicken or
pork, or as the basis of a cooling drink." (add water or sparkling
water to dilute).

In a non-aluminium saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Pour over the
rosemary and let steep for 1 hour. Strain. Remove the zest from 5 of
the oranges and set aside, then squeeze the juice into a large bowl.
Set a rack over the bowl and arrange the zests on the rack. Combine
the rosemary infusion and the sugar mixture in a saucepan and bring
to a boil over high heat, boiling until you have a heavy syrup about
20 minutes. Pour the boiling syrup over the zests and let it drain
into the juice. Return the juice mixture to the saucepan. Bring
quickly to a boil, remove from the heat, and return to the bowl to
cool. Skim, then bottle and store in the refrigerator.
