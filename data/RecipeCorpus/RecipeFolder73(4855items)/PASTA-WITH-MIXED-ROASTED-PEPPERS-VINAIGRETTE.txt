Roast, peel, stem, and seed the peppers. To Roast peppers: Place them
in a foil-lined baking sheet in a 500 degree oven. Roast until their
skins are evenly blistered and browned, about 25 minutes, turning
them 2 or 3 times so they roast evenly. Remove them from the oven and
cover them with a kitchen towel. When peppers are cool enough to
handle, pull out their stems, peel away their blackened skins; open
the peppers up; and remove their seeds, using a teaspoon to pick up
any stray ones. Tear the peppers up into 1/2 to 1/2-inch wide strips,
and save their juices, set aside. In a large skillet, heat the olive
oil with the garlic over moderate heat. When the garlic sizzles, add
the pepper strips and their juices. Then stir in the vinegar. As soon
as the liquid sizzles, stir in the basil and parsley and spoon the
sauce over cooked pasta.
