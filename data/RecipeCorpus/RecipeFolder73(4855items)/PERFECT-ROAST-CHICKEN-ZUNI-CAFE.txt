Title: PERFECT ROAST CHICKEN ZUNI CAFE
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
1    2 3/4 - 3 lb Free Range
Chicken
(Chicken should be yellow;
Not pale white)
Trim the fat.  Remove giblets.  Slip two peeled garlic cloves and a
sprig of fresh marjoram (you can use any herb - except rosemary)
under the skin of the breast on each side.

Generously sprinkle kosher salt and pepper all over the bird, very
generous with the salt.  Then, refrigerate overnight (usually they
let it sit for 24 hours).

Zuni Cafe roasts the chicken in a beehive oven made of brick over a
wood fire, oak and almond or apple, for a special smoky taste which
can't be replicated at home.

Place the chicken on a pan (you can use a rack if you like so the
juices fall down into the pan) and cook it for approximately 25 - 40
minutes depending on the oven temperature. The oven temperature
should be as hot as you can get it -- maybe 450 - 500 degrees. When
the juices run clear and the chicken is brown, it is done. The
important thing is to keep an eye on the chicken so it doesn't over
cook.

Let the chicken sit for awhile (5 min.), cut it up and Enjoy!!!
