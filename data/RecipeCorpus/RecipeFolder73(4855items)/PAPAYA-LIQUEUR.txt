Title: PAPAYA LIQUEUR
Categories: Alcohol, Beverages
Yield: 1 Pint
1    Papaya
1 c  Vodka
1 sm Lemon wedge, scraped peel
1/4 c  Sugar syrup, optional to
-taste (see recipe)
Look for medium-sized papaya (slightly larger than a pear) with
smooth, unbruised skin, and a fruity aroma. Best time is May and
June. Dark spots on the skin are a bad sign and will cause a bad
flavor (check stem for decay and softness). Cut papaya in half,
remove seeds, and peel skin. Cut in medium chunks and place in vodka
with lemon peel(twist to release flavor). Let steep for 1 week.
Strain and squeeze fruit, extracting juice. If desired, add sugar
syrup. Store for 3 weeks. Yield: 1 pint Container: quart jar
