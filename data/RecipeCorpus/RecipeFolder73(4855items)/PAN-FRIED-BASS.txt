Title: PAN-FRIED BASS
Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Bass, cleaned, head and
Tails removed
Bacon drippings
Corn meal
Salt and pepper
Wipe the fish with a cloth dipped in lightly salted water. Rub the
fish lightly with bacon drippings and roll in corn meal. Dust a
little salt and pepper in the cavities. Heat bacon drippings in a
cast iron fry pan. Drippings should be 1/4 - 1/2 inch deep and hot
enough to brown a 1 inch cube of bread in 2 minutes (no hotter). Cook
fish until it is browned on one side, about 4 minutes, then turn and
brown on the other side. Drain on paper towel before serving. Source:
