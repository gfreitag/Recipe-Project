BREAKFAST PANCAKE. Sift the flour before measuring. Resift with the
salt, sugar and baking powder. Beat the eggs lightly and combine with
the melted butter and milk. Mix the liquid ingredients quickly into
the sifted ingredients. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours
(the longer the better). Preheat the griddle. The griddle is ready
when a drop of cold water skitters about on the surface of the
griddle for several seconds before evaporating. Use a tablespoon to
gently spoon the batter onto the griddle. When bubbles appear on the
top of the griddle cakes, check the underside of to see how they are
doing. Turn when golden brown. The second side will take only about
half as long as the first to cook. Serve hot with syrup, bacon,
sausages, etc.
