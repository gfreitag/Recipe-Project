Title: PASTA PRIMAVERA (LACTO)
Categories: Digest, Mar95
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2    To 2/3 lb pasta (I like
Fusili--the spirals)
1    Onion
1/2 lb Mushrooms
4    Or 5 cloves garlic
1 ea Some dry sherry
1    Tin SKIM evaporated milk
(less than 3 g fat per tin)
1    Red pepper
1    Green pepper
1 ts Salt
1 ea Black pepper
Chop the onion, garlic, and mushroom.  Saute over high heat in enouch
sherry to keep it wet for about 10 minutes. Put the pasta water on to
boil.

Reduce the heat under the veggies and add the tin of milk. Put the
pasta in the boiling water.  Simmer the sauce over low heat while the
pasta cooks. Chop up the red and green peppers and add them to the
simmering sauce. Add salt & black pepper to taste. Let simmer for
about 5 minutes, which should be enough time to cook the pasta.

Drain the pasta, pour the sauce over the pasta, and serve. Sprinkle
with a bit of parmisan cheese or nutritional yeast, and more black
pepper, to taste.

Variations:  obviously, vary the vegitable content. Sun dried
tomatoes are one of my favourite candidates.
