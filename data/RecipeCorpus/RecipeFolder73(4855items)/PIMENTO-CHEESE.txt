From Jeff Murphy:

This is my mother's recipe.

She ground a jar of pimentos first, then maybe half a thing of
Velveeta (you do all this to taste - you're a cook: make it taste
good) to push the remaining pimentos through the grinder; added a
fair amount of mayonnaise, a teaspoon of prepared mustard, salt, and
lots of pepper. Stirred it up, spread it on a single piece of bread
folded over (I don't know why that tasted better; maybe it was
because *she* made it) - although today I would serve it open-faced,
leave out the salt, and add some green salad olives on top.
