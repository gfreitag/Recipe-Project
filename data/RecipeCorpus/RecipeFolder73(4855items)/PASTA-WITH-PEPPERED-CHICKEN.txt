Title: PASTA WITH PEPPERED CHICKEN
Categories: Cheese, Main dish, Pasta, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Bone-in chicken breast
2 ts Black peppercorns; cracked
2    Garlic cloves; minced
3 tb Olive oil
1 1/2 c  Chicken broth
1 tb Lemon juice; or to taste
Salt; to taste
2    Or 3 sprigs savory or
2    Or 3 sprigs parsley
12 oz Dry ribbon noodles
-- such as linguine
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
1/2 c  Fresh grated Parmesan cheese
Skin and bone chicken breasts and cut them on the diagonal into strips
about 3/8" wide.  Toss chicken with cracked pepper, garlic, and 1 tb.
of the olive oil. Marinate, covered and refrigerated, for an hour or
as long as overnight.

When ready to serve, bring ample water to boil to cook the pasta.

Heat remaining olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add
chicken and lightly brown it all over, about 3 minutes. Add chicken
broth and lemon juice; reduce heat to a simmer.  Simmer the sauce for
about 8 minutes.

Cook pasta until it is just done.  While pasta is cooking, chop
savory or parsley leaves and add them to the chicken. Adjust sauce
with lemon juice and/or salt to taste.

Drain pasta and toss with the chicken.  Serve the dish hot, passing
the Parmesan separately.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

Belsinger and Dille write: "Pepper's pungency plays off the flavors of
starches and mild meats especially well. For a vegetarian version of
pasta with pepper, toss hot pasta with the Spicy Butter with Four
Peppercorns, some lemon juice, and chopped savory or parsley; serve
with Parmesan."
