MMMMM-----------------------PEANUT FILLING----------------------------
2 c  Confectioner's Sugar
2 tb Butter or margerine; soft
1 tb Milk
2 ts Granulated sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Creamy peanut butter
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
6 oz Chocolate chips; semi-sweet,
-=OR=- milk chocolate
1 1/2 tb Solid Vegetable shortening
Mix first 6 ingrediants together by hand or with blender until
blended. Mix in Peanut Butter.Line Jelly Roll pan with wax paper(I
used foil and it worked fine) Roll teaspoons of filling into 3/4 inch
balls(I used my hands to do this--it wasn't sticky at all... more
creamy. And make the balls on the small side...they seem to taste
better that way). Place on lined pan...refrigerate for at least 2
hours.

Melt chips and shortening together on stove (I use the microwave for 2
minutes on high).  Use a toothpick to dip into melted mixture). I dump
about 10 balls into chocolate, roll around with a spoon and lift them
out with the toothpick-- Before chocolate sets, decorate with colored
sugar, non-pareils etc.  Refrigerate 10-15 minutes to set chocolate.
Remove from paper or foil. Store in airtight container in
refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Yields: 60 little Balls.
