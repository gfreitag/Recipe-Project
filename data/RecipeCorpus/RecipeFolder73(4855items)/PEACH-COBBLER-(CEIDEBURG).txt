MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
Place the prepared peaches in an 8-inch square baking pan and sprinkle
evenly with the sugar.  Drizzle on the lemon juice and dot with the
butter. Set aside.

TOPPING:

Combine the flour, sugar salt and baking powder in a large bowl and
stir together with a fork.  Cut the butter into bits and drop it into
the bowl, then cut it into the flour mixture until dough resembles
fine, even crumbs. Slowly add the milk, stirring with a fork. Gather
the dough together and place it on a lightly floured surface. Knead 8
to 10 times, until it is fairly smooth.  Roll or pat the dough into a
shape that will fit the baking dish ++ it should be no more than 1/2
inch thick , so trim edges if necessary.

Place the dough over the fruit in the pan, pressing it down into the
fruit all around the edges.  Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until the
juices are bobbling, the biscuit crust is golden brown and the
peaches are tender when pierced through the crust with a knife.
Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack.  Serve warm with heavy
cream.

Serves 6.
