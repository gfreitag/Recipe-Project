Title: PASTA & POTATO STEW
Categories: Soups, Vegetables, Pasta
Yield: 8 Servings
1 lg Onion, coarsely chopped
1/3 c  Celery, chopped
1 ts Olive oil
1/4 c  Dry red wine or grape juice
2 cl Garlic, minced
2 c  Roma tomatoes, chopped
1/3 c  Fresh parsley, chopped
1/3 c  Carrots, chopped
1 c  Cooked & diced red potatoes
1 c  Macaroni, cooked
2 c  Cooked kidney beans
8 c  Vegetable broth or water
1 tb Basil, dried
1/2 ts Oregano, dried
1 ts Chives, dried
In a large soup pot over medium high heat, saute onion and celery in
oil and red wine until onion is limp but not brown. (add some of the
stock if onion starts to stick) Add garlic, tomatoes, parsley and
carrots; cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add remaining
ingredients; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook
uncovered until vegetables are soft; about 15 minutes. Before
serving, puree 1 cup of stew in a blender and add back. Adjust
seasonings as needed.

Variation: For a thicker stew, use uncooked diced potatoes and
macaroni. Cook until potatoes and pasta are tender, about 25 minutes
instead of the original 15. Proceed with remaining steps.
