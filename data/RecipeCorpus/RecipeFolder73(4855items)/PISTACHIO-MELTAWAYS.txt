Title: PISTACHIO MELTAWAYS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 60 Servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Shelled and chopped
Pistachio nuts, toasted
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
8 tb (1 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
1/2 lb (8 ounces) Monterey Jack
Cheese, shredded (2 to
2-1/2 cups, loosely packed)
1/4 c  Half-and-half
"Exceedingly rich, these crackers have a pronounced pistachio flavor.
They are quite versatile and can be enjoyed with a cup of hot tea or
a dish of ice cream. 325~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to
325~F.

Mix the flour, nuts, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl or in
the food processor. Cut the butter into the flour mixture until it
resembles coarse meal. Add the cheese and mix until the cheese is
coated evenly.

Slowly add enough of the half-and-half to form a dough that will hold
together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out to about 1/4 inch thick. With a
sharp knife, cut the dough into 2-inch squares and arrange them on an
ungreased baking sheet. Make sure the edges are not touching.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Don't let these Meltaways get more than
medium brown. Cool them on a rack. Yield: 50-60.

VARIATIONS: If pistachios are not available, cashews or macadamias are
excellent substitutes.
