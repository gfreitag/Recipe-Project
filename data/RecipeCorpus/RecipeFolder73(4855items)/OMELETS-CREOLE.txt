Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Eggs, Cheese
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Onion,chopped
1/2 c  Green bell pepper,chopped
1/2 c  Celery,finely chopped
2 tb Butter or margarine
1 cn Tomatoes(16oz)

MMMMM--------------------------OMELETS-------------------------------
8    Eggs
1/2 c  Water
4 tb Butter or margarine
1. In medium saucepan over medium heat, cook onion, bell pepper and
celery in butter, stirring occasionally, until tender but not brown,
about 5 minutes.

2. Stir in tomatoes, breaking apart with spoon if necessary.

3. Stir in seasonings; increase heat to high and cook, stirring
occasionally, until mixture thickens, about 8 to 10 minutes.

4. Stir shrimp into tomato mixture, then reduce heat to low; simmer
just until heated through, about 2 to 3 minutes.

5. Prepare omelets; while omelet is still moist and creamy-looking,
fill each with 1/2 cup hot shrimp mixture.

6. With pancake turner, fold omelet in half or roll; invert onto
plate with quick flip of the wrist or slide from pan onto plate.

7. Top each omelet with 2 tablespoons shrimp mixture.

*** OMELETS ***

1. Mix eggs and water.

2. In 7- to 10-inch omelet pan or skillet over medium-high heat, heat
1 tablespoon butter until just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water.

3. Pour in 1/2 cup egg mixture (mixture should set immediately at
edges).

4. With inverted pancake turner, carefully push cooked portions at
edges toward center so uncooked portions can reach hot pan surface,
tilting pan and moving cooked portions as necessary.

NOTE: It is better to fill slightly underdone omelet; heat retained
in eggs completes the cooking. For a more authentic touch, add a few
drops of hot pepper sauce. Round out the menu with okra and rice.
