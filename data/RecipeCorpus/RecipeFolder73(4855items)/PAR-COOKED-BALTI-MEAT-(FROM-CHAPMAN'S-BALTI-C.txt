Title: PAR-COOKED BALTI MEAT (FROM CHAPMAN'S BALTI C
Categories: Balti, Indian, Meats
Yield: 16 Servings
6 lb Meat (lamb, beef, pork),
-cut into 1/4 inch cubes,
-weighed after cubing
1 pt Stock or water
4 tb Balti masala paste
Preheat the oven to 375F. Bring the stock or water to the boil in a
large lidded casserole dish. Add the meat and masala paste and
simmer, stirring occasionally. Cover and put in the oven, and cook
for 20 minutes. Inspect it and add water if needed.  Cook for another
20 minutes and test the meat for tenderness: it should still "resist"
a little and feel not quite ready. If it's reached this stage, remove
the casserole from the oven, remove the meat, cool it, package it in
plastic containers or Ziploc bags, and freeze: or refrigerate until
needed (if you're going to need it in no more than 8 hours). Reserve
the stock: it too can be frozen and added to Balti sauce or curry
sauce as desired.
