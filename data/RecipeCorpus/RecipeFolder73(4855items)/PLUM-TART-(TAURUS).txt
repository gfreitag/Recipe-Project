Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 c  Flour
2 tb Sugar
1    Pinch of Salt
10 tb Vegetable shortening
4 tb Cold milk
2 lb Ripe plums
3/4 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Cream cheese
2 ts Cornstarch
2 tb Kirsch
Servings:  6

Prepare pastry - combine flour, sugar, salt and cinnamon, cut in
shortening (may use butter if desired). Make well in center, add
milk, blend. Mix to a dough, wrap and let chill for 20-30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Roll pastry to line a 10" pie pan, trim and crimp edges, prick bottom
and sides with fork and bake for 20 minutes. Remove and let cool.

Rinse plums, cut in half, remove pits.  Place in saucepan with brown
sugar over low heat. (They are moist enough not to need any water.)
Cover and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and using
slotted spoon remove plums. Reserve juices.

Spread cream cheese evenly over bottom of pastry, arrange plums over
cheese.  Whisk cornstarch into plum juices, return to heat, stirring
until thickens, cook, stirring occasionally, for a few minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in Kirsch, pour over plums, using a pastry
brush to spread the mixture evenly.  Chill until the glaze has set.

A soft, beautiful dish that will appeal to the esthetic in Taurus.
Plum tart is particularly delicious served with whipped cream or a
thick custard and a sweet white dessert wine.
