Title: PANZAROTTI (FRIED CHEESE-FILLED CRESCENTS)
Categories: Italian, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Plus
3 tb Butter
Salt
1    Egg yolk
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
4 oz Mozzarella
3 oz Cooked ham
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
Pinch of nutmeg
2 tb Chopped parsley
2    Eggs, beaten
Oil for frying
Sift the flour into a mound, make a well in the center and add the
butter, cut into pieces, a pinch of salt and an egg yolk. Mix
together, kneading and gradually adding sufficient water to obtain a
smooth elastic dough. Shape into a ball, cover and leave to stand in
a cool place for at least 1/2 hour. Roll out, folding the dough over
on to itself a few times, as if making flaky pastry, then roll out
into a thin sheet. Cut into circles about 3 inches in diameter. Dice
the Mozzarella, cut the ham into pieces and place in a bowl with the
2 whole eggs, grated Parmesan, pinch of nutmeg and chopped parsley.
Mix well, then spoon a little into the center of each circle. Brush
the edges with beaten egg, fold over and press gently. Heat plenty of
oil in a skillet.  When hot, dip the crescents in beaten egg and then
fry, a few at a time, until golden brown and puffed up. Drain well on
paper towles and serve piping hot.
