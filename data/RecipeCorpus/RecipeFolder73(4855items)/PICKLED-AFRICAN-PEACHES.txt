Title: PICKLED AFRICAN PEACHES
Categories: African, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
4 lb Slightly under ripe peaches
3 c  Sliced onions
1/3 c  Olive oil
1 tb Turmeric
1 tb Ground cumin
2 ts Minced garlic
1 ts Minced ginger
1 ts Dried red pepper
1/2 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Ground cardamom
1/2 ts Dry mustard
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground cloves.
2 c  White wine vinegar
2/3 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
2/3 c  White sugar
Haven't made this for a couple of years, but it's pretty tasty. Saute
onions in olive oil for five minutes or until tender. Add spices and
saute for 2 minutes. Stir in vinegar and sugars, then simmer, partly
covered for 15 minutes.

Blanch peaches slightly in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain, peel
pit and slice.  Add to onion mixture and simmer just until tender.
Transfer with slotted spoon to sterilized mason jar.

Reduce syrup over high heat to 1 1/2 cups.  Add slowly to jars to
almost cover fruit.  Stir.  Fill jars slowly with syrup, cap loosely
and cool.

Tighten caps and let stand in dark place at least 2 weeks.

I don't remember where this came from, but I suspect that it was
either Gourmet or Sunset Magazine.  In my handwritten copy it also
called for 2 teaspoons ground cumin as well as one tablespoon. I
omitted it above, but I think it should have been 2 teaspoons ground
coriander.
