(Note from Larry: I have 2 other .. very similar .. recipes. Both have
almost identical ingredients. The difference lies in the directions
and Rose's comments. I felt it was necessary to add the reference to
Tony Roma's in the title for this reason. 4/14/95) Slice onions
crosswise and separate into rings. Combine milk, eggs and salt to
taste in mixing bowl. Soak onion rings in mixture 30 minutes. Place
pancake mix in shallow bowl. Heat oil for frying in skillet to 375
degrees. Remove onion rings from milk mixture, dip in pancake mix and
place in hot oil. Fry rings until golden brown. Drain fried onion
rings on paper towels. Pack fried onion rings solidly, but loosely,
without pressing, into 8x4-inch loaf pan. Bake at 400 degrees 10 to
15 minutes. Turn onto serving plate. Garnish with parsley. Each

column, 1/26/95, H27. "DEAR SOS: Would it be possible to get the
recipe for the onion loaf served at Tony Roma's restaurants? It's
outstanding. ~Betty "DEAR BETTY: Thank you. We love the rings too.
The Tony Roma restaurant chain would not share its trade secret, but
a close facsimile recipe was developed by home economist, Donna
Deane, director of The Times Test Kitchen. Tony Roma's staff did,
however, offer a tip: Pack the onions loosely (not firmly) in the
loaf pan so they do not become soggy."
