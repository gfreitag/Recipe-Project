Title: PEARS WITH BILBERRIES
Categories: Desserts, Fruits, Vegan
Yield: 2 Servings
2 lg Pears; peeled & left whole
25 g  Butter
- cut into small pieces
1    Glass of red wine
40 g  Caster sugar
1    Cinnamon stick, 2.5 cm
100 g  Bilberries (or blueberries)
Crme fraiche (Vegans omit)
Poaching pears in a slow oven transforms them completely, and although
cooked through until soft, they do not lose their firm, grainy
texture. A little cinnamon and red wine flavour the sauce, and the
bilberries are an inspired touch.

Arrange the pears in an ovenproof dish. Add the butter, red wine,
sugar, cinnamon stick and bilberries or blueberries.

Bake at 200 degrees C / 400 degrees F / gas 6 for 1 hour, covered
with foil and basting every 10 minutes. Serve hot or warm, with crme
fraiche.
