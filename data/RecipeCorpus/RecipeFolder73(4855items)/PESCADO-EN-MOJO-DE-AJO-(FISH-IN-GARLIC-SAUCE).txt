Title: PESCADO EN MOJO DE AJO (FISH IN GARLIC SAUCE)
Categories: Fish, Mexican
Yield: 1 Batch
Skinless fillets of any
Mild white fish
Flour
Clarified butter
A LOT of garlic)
Juice of one lime
Additional lime wedges
Use only Clarified butter (don't think of using margarine)

Dust the fillets lightly with flour.  Meanwhile, heat some of the
clarified butter in a frying pan until hot but not smoking. Saute the
fish until lightly browned (some Mexican cooks fry fish until it is
the approximate consistancy of our potato chips <crisps>, but I feel
this is taking authenticity a bit too far
:-).

Remove the fish from the pan, and add additional butter if needed
(you will want about 2-3 Tbsp. of melted butter per fillet to sauce
the finished dish). Add garlic to the pan and saute garlic until it
is a light brown color.  Do not allow it to burn, but do allow the
garlic to take on some color and become slightly crisp. Squeeze in
the lime juice.

Pour the hot butter/garlic mixture over the fish, and serve.

This dish is quite common in Southern Mexico, and traditionally would
be served with black beans (either whole or refried); perhaps a
simple dish of rice, cooked in chicken broth with chopped cilantro
and a few diced green chiles; a side relish of homemade fresh salsa
(see Pico de Gallo).
