PREPARATION OF DOUGH: 1. Sprinkle the yeast and half the sugar on the
warm water in a small bowl. Stir until yeast dissolves. Let stand
until mixture is dubbly. 2. Put most of the flour and the salt into a
medium bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture and oil and keep stirring
until a smooth soft dough forms. 3. Knead on a floured surface, using
as much of the remaining flour as necessary to form a stiff elastic
dough. Place dough in a large greased bowl, cover and let rise in a
warm place until doubled in volume (30 to 45 minutes) and not sticky.
While the dough is rising, prepare your topping sauce. 4. Punch down
dough. Knead briefly on lightly floured surface to distribute air
bubbles; let dough rest 5 minutes longer. 5. Flatten dough into
circle on lightly floured surface. Roll out from center towards edges
to form a flat round, then place in a greased 12-inch pizza pan.
Sprinkel dough with extra virgin olive oil. 6. Pour preferred topping
over pizza dough and bake in oven preheated to 220C(450F) until
golden brown (about 20 minutes). Cut into wedges and serve.
