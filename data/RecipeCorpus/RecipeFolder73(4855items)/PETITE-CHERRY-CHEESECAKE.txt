Title: PETITE CHERRY CHEESECAKE
Categories: Cheesecakes
Yield: 24 Servings
-Barb Day
16 oz Cream cheese; softened
3/4 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
1 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Vanilla
24    Vanilla wafers
21 oz Cherry pie filling
Beat cream cheese; sugar, eggs, lemon juice and vanilla until light
and fluffy. Line muffin tins with paper baking cups, and place a
vanilla wafer in the bottom of each. Fill each 2/3 full with the
cream cheese mixture. Bake at 375 degrees 15 to 20 minutes, or until
set. Top each with about 1 tablespoonful of the pie filling.
I use different pie fillings, and sometimes more than one when
making a recipe, they look very nice on frilly paper doilies, with
the different colors of toppings. If you make marzipan, some green
marzipan leaves look pretty on top, and at times I have made some
little chocolate doodle figures to use with these. Barb Day
