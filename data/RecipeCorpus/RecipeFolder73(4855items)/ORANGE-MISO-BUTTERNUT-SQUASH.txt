Title: ORANGE-MISO BUTTERNUT SQUASH
Categories: Digest, Side dish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Butter nut Squash, peeled
-and coarsely diced
1 c  Carrots, thinly sliced
1 c  Onions, coarsely chopped
2/3 c  Orange juice
1 1/2 tb Miso, white
-Broth as needed
Dissolve miso in orange juice and set aside. Cook butter nut squash in
water until it just looses its firmness and drain. Meanwhile saute,
in a large skillet, the carrots and onions in broth until onions are
just translucent and the carrots are crisp tender. Add the squash and
orange juice mixture to the carrots and onions. Continue cooking
until the squash has the desired texture and the moisture has boiled
off.

This recipe is my adaption of one from Friendly Foods by Ron
Picarski. The combination of orange juice and white miso gives the
dish a very pleasant taste.
