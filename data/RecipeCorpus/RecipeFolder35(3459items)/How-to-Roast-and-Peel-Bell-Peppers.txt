Peppers are among the few foods you're actually allowed to burn.
Charring the skin imparts a distinctive smoky flavor and brings out a
pepper's sweetness. Here's how:

1. Place 4 hard, firm shiny bell peppers directly on a gas or electric
burner preheated to the hottest setting. Roast the peppers until
completely charred and black on all sides, turning with tongs. This
will take about 6-8 minutes. Be sure to roast the ends of the peppers
as well. Peppers can also be roasted under the broiler or over a high
flame on the grill.

2. Wrap the roasted peppers in wet paper towels for 5 minutes or
place them in a sealed paper bag. This helps steam off the skin. To
peel the peppers, scrape off the charred skin with a paring knife,
stiff brush, or your fingers.

3. To core and seed the peppers, cut them in half lengthwise. Cut out
the stem end. Trim or scrape away any white pith and seeds inside.
Roasted peppers are great marinated in balsamic vinegar and olive
oil. Slice them into salads or purÂ‚e them in soups and sauces.

4 bell peppers makes about 1 cup roasted peppers.
