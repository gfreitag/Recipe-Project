Title: Mom's Alfredo Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Italian, Pasta/rice
Yield: 1 batch
Black pepper to taste
1/4 ts Nutmeg, grated
1 pt Heavy cream
1    Stick butter
1 c  Parmesan cheese, grated
This sauce goes so well with one particular pasta that it's hard to
think of it as anything but "Fettuccine Alfredo."  However, for a
change of pace it's also good tossed with cheese tortellini or any of
the short, twisted pasta.  If the heavy cream and butter alarm you,
it's better to choose a different sauce, rather than substituting
other ingredients.

Heat cream in a large saucepan, but don't let it boil.  Melt butter
in a large skillet.  Stir in the warm cream, then the cheese, pepper
and nutmeg. Add hot pasta and toss well to thoroughly coat.

For a light meal, marinate cooked vegetables in a vinaigrette
dressing for an hour or more at room temperature.  Toss with hot
pasta such as penne, shells or bows, and serve with garlic French
bread. ** Mom's recipe card file  **
