Another recipe from Publix, Cocoa Beach, Florida.

Wash and scrape artichokes. Drop into boiling salted water. Cook until
tender. Drain and melt butter; add white wine, tabasco sauce and
parsley. Pour these ingredients over the artichokes or cream in a
cream sauce.

Drain the artichokes as soon as they are tender; if permitted to cook
beyond this point they will become tough.
