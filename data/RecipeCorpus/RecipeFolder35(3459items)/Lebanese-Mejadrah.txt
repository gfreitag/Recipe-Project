1 1/2 c  Long-grain rice

3 c  (to 4 C.) chicken stock
Onions:

Peel and slice onions into ¬-inch slices and separate them into rings.
Place in a large bowl and cover with milk. Soak, stirring once or
twice, for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the flour, salt and pepper
together in a large paper bag. DRain and discard milk and shake
onions in flour mixture. Heat 1-inch of oil in a heavy iron skillet
to about 375øF. on a deep fry thermometer. Fry the flour-coated
onions a few at a time until crisp and golden, about 3 minutes. Drain
on paper towels, set aside and keep warm in a low oven.

Lentils and Rice:

Melt butter in a heavy 2«-qt. shallow casserole. Add onions and
garlic and saut over medium heat for 1 minute, stirring until the
onions are translucent. Stir in rice and continue to stir until the
grains are coated with the butter, about 2-3 minutes. Add stock and
salt and pepper, and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover casserole
tightly with aluminum foil and reduce heat as low as possible. Cook
for 40 minutes (depending on type of rice used) and don't peek.
Remove foil and fluff rice with a fork, scraping up the bottom crust
and stirring it into the rice.

Meanwhile, in a 3-qt. saucepan, cover lentils with water by about 2
inches. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer until lentils are tender,
about 25 minutes. Drain and rinse lentils with hot water.  Season and
stir into rice when it's finished, and top with the crisp, fried
onions.

Note: The rice and lentils can be made ahead, covered loosely with
foil and kept warm in a preheated low 250øF. oven until serving time.
