Title: Smoking Salmon And Trout Part XI - Pickle Smoked Fish
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Can/preserv, Information
Yield: 1 text file  Pickle smoked: fish are pickled before smoking. This is a good way to
enhance the taste of lean fish that do not otherwise smoke well.

Prepare and defat skinless fillets: To do this, when you fillet, leave
plenty of meat on the backbone where the meat is especially fat. Cut
off the belly portion. Skin the fillet leaving about 1/8" meat on the
skin. Make cuts on either side of the lateral line, lift it out and
discard it. Divide the fillet into pieces of different thickness.

The pickling procedure is similar to corning meats. The flavored
sugar-salt brine is weaker than normally used and the fish brined
longer to achieve a cured taste. prepare brine in the following
proportions: 4 tb mixed pickling spice, 3 cups salt and 2 cups brown
sugar per 4 qts water. Keep the brine and fish below 45 deg F at all
times. Use a salinometer and maintain salinity at 60 deg minimum at
all times adding more salt periodically if needed. Don't over pickle;
remove the thinner pieces as they become cured.

Overhaul [stir and move around] the pieces daily to ensure even
pickling. When ready rinse off the pieces and let water drain off.
Cold smoke at medium density 7 to 10 hours depending on thickness or
30 to 48 hours natural draft depending on thickness and weather.
Continue until the flesh is firm enough for slicing. Cool the
finished product almost onto freezing before wrapping to prevent
sweating and spoilage. Freeze the surplus. Serve as for Lox and
Scotch smoked.
