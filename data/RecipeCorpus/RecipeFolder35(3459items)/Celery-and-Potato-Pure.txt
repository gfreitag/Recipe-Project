Title: Celery and Potato Pure
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables, Potatoes
Yield: 4 servings
Into large chunks
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1 pn Grated nutmeg
2 bn Celery (abt 1 3/4 lb ea)
1/2 c  Chicken stock (approx)
5 tb Butter
5    Baking potatoes (8oz ea)
-peeled and cut
Remove the tough outer celery ribs and reserve them for another use.
Rinse the hearts well and dry them. Cut off the root and «-inch off
the top; chop the rest of the celery into approx. 1-inch pieces,
including all of the leaves. (You should have about 4 cups.)

In a large frying pan, combine the celery, stock, and 1 tbs of the
butter. Cover and simmer over low heat until the celery is tender,
about 30 minutes. Uncover and cook about 5 minutes longer to
evaporate the liquid. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, cook the potatoes in boiling salted
water until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.

In a food processor, pulse the celery until smooth. If the pure is
thin and watery, return it to the heat and reduce until thickened.
(You should have about 1 cup celery puree. By itself this would make
a good sauce for poached chicken or fish.)

In a large mixing bowl, combine the potatoes, 4 tbs. butter, the
cream, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. With a potato masher or whisk, mash
the potatoes until fairly smooth. Stir in the celery pure. Taste for
seasoning and add salt and pepper as needed.
