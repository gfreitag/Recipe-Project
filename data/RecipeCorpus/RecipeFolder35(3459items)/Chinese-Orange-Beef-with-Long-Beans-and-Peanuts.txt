Freeze the beef and let it thaw slightly to make it easier to cut.
Cut beef first into Â«-inch slices, then into strips and then into
pieces about the size of a large peanut.

Place beef on a flat platter. Whisk together the garlic ,soy, sherry
and cornstarch. Add the sugar, salt and orange peel and mix well.
Pour marinade over beef and let stand for 30 minutes, turning once or
twice to coat the meat completely.

Fill a 3-qt. saucepan about 3/4 full with water and bring to a boil.
when water is boiling rapidly, add the long bean pieces, bring water
to a boil again and parboil beans for 3 minutes. Drain beans and set
aside.

Heat a 12-inch non-stick skillet or wok over high heat and add 1 tbs
of corn oil. Tip skillet or wok to cover surface with the hot oil.
Add the beef along with the marinade and quickly stir with a wooden
spoon (if using a wok, use can use Chinese stir-fry metal tools,if
desired). Stir-fry only until beef loses its red color, about 30
seconds. Remove to a plate, then add the rest of the corn oil to the
same skillet. Add the long beans, stirring vigorously for about 10
seconds, then add the chicken stock. Stir once or twice, cover and
cook for about 2 minutes. Uncover, add the reserved beef, and mix
thoroughly for about 15 seconds. Transfer to a serving platter, then
top with the peanut halves and serve, accompanied by a bowl of rice,
if desired
