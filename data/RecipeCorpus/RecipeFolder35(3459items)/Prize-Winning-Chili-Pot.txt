In dutch oven or large pot or kettle, heat oil over medium
heat.  Add a third of the meat.  Cook and stir until it loses
pink color.  Remove with slotted spoon to platter and repeat
with remaining meat.  Return meat and collected juices to pan
along with the minced onion, chili powder, cumin, paprika,
oregano, garlic, salt, thyme, sage, chicken broth, beer and
tomato sauce (i.e. everything except sugar & pepper).  Bring
to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, partially covered for 1.5
hours, stirring occasionally.  Just before serving, stir in
the sugar and black pepper.

Serve with a dollop of sour cream or spoon over beans, rice
or pasta if desired.

Makes about 6 to 8 servings.
