Title: Cuban Caramel Custard
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
4 lg Eggs
4 lg Egg yolks
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/4 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Water
1/2    Lemon -- juice only
Combine the sugar, water and lemon juice in a saucepan and cook,
stirring, until the sugar dissolves.  Boil the syrup, uncovered,
without stirring, until it thickens slightly and reaches 225, about 7
minutes.  Pour all but about 1/4 cup of the syrup into a heatproof
bowl; set aside to cool. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350.
Continue to cook the reserved 1/4 cup syrup, without stirring, until
it turns medium amber, 3 to 5 minutes. Immediately pour the caramel
into an 8" square baking dish, tilting the dish to coat the bottom
evenly.  Set aside.  Add the eggs, egg yolks and vanilla to the bowl
of cooled syrup; whisk until blended.  Place the baking dish in a
roasting pan; pour the custard mixture into the caramel lined dish.
Place the roasting pan on the center rack of the oven.  Pour in
enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the baking dish.
Bake until the custard is almost set but still quite liquid in the
center (it will firm as it cools), about 25 minutes.  Remove from the
water bath and cool the custard on a wire rack.  Chill the custard
until cold, at least 2 hours.  Run the tip of a knife along the edge
of the custard and unmold onto a serving plate, so the caramel side
is up.  Serve in small portions.
