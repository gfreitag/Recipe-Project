Tandoori Ovens are like small clay furnaces. Because the heat is
fierce and evenly distributed the food cooks fast. A similar effect
can be achieved by grilling or barbecuing the food. The traditional
flavour and reddish colour of tandoori food is produced by first
marinating it in a spicy yoghurt mixture tinted with a red food
colouring or paprika. Submitted By KAZ LANGRIDGE   On   09-24-95
