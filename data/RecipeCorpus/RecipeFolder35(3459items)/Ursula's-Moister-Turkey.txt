Title: Ursula's Moister Turkey
Categories: Holiday, Poultry
Yield: 1 servings
Fresh sage and thyme
2    Oranges -- quartered
2    Carrots -- cut in chunks
2    Ribs Celery -- cut in 1"
-pieces
1 cn Chicken stock
1 cn Consome
(You do not need to baste
This bird)
lg Roll of heavy foil
3 lg Onions -- sliced
1    12 to 24 lb Turkey
Salt and pepper
Brandy or Grand Marnier *
*  (also put 2 T. in gravy with drippings and cornstarch in water)

Preheat oven to 475 degrees.  Tear off 4 large pieces of foil about
2 1/2 feet long.  Fold together 2 pieces to form a big square. Fold
several times so that they are well-sealed.  Repeat with other two
pieces.  Place one double sheet of foil in a pan large enough to hold
the turkey.  Cover the bottom with onion slices.

Rub inside turkey cavity with salt and pepper.  Rub outside with
brandy.  Loosen the skin around the leg and thigh by rubbing hand
between skin and meat.  Tuck sage and thyme under the skin of legs and
thigh.  Put oranges, carrots and celery in turkey cavity. Place
turkey on onions and foil and pull foil up to form a container.

In a small sauce pan, bring the chicken stock and consome to a
boil.  Pour boiling liquid over the turkey.  Place other double sheet
of foil on top of turkey; blouse it up a little over the turkey, then
fold the two big pieces of foil together well around all edges to
seal.

Cook at 475 degrees 1 hour for 12 pounds, and an additional 5
minutes for each pound.  (For example, a 14-pound bird would take
one hour and 10 minutes.)  Pull the turkey out.  VERY CAREFULLY
peel back the top piece of foil so the turkey can brown.  Turn oven
down and cook at 375 degrees for the same amount of time that you
cooked at the high temperature.  Permit to stand at least 30 minutes
before cutting.

DON'T need to baste!
