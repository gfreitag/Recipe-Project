Place the meat in a mixing bowl with the garlic, cardamon, and fresh
ground pepper and marinate for 15 minutes. Combine the yogurt,
mustard, cognac and flour in a small bowl and whisk until smooth.

Heat the oil in a large non-stick fry pan. Cook the onions over
medium-low heat for 10 minutes, or until a deep golden brown,
stirring often. Add the sugar after 5 minutes to help the onions
brown.

Just before serving, season the beef with salt and pepper. Increase
the heat to high, add the beef to the onions, and saut for 1-2
minutes, or until cooked to taste. Stir in the yogurt mixture and
bring to a boil. Correct the seasoning, adding salt and pepper to
taste. Sprinkle the beef with the chives and serve at once.
