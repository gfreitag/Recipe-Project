Title: Mom's Ragu
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Italian, Pasta/rice
Yield: 1 batch
Salt & black pepper to taste
1 c  Dry white wine
1/2 c  Milk or half and half
1/8 ts Nutmeg
16 oz Can Italian tomatoes, pushed
. through a sleve (to remove
. seeds)
1/2 c  Pammesan cheese, grated
3 tb Olive oil
3 tb Butter
1 md Onion, chopped
2    Celery, chopped
1 md Carrot, chopped
6 md Mushrooms, chopped (opt)
3/4 lb Lean ground beef
(preferabiy ground chuck)
This is probably the forerumner of all those familiar Italian-American
tomato-meat sauces for spaghetti. Try it on meat tortellini too, or
any short pasta with twists, grooves or crinkles that hold the sauce.
It's also an excellent sauce for lasagne.

Heat oil and butter over medium heat in a large heavy pot or skillet.
Add onion, celery and carrot and cook until onion is translucent and
soft but not brown, about 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until
soft, another 4 or 5 minutes. Add meat, salt and pepper. Cook while
stirring, just until meat loses its red color. Do not brown. Add wine
and simmer until it evaporates, 10 to 15 minutes. Add milk and
nutmeg. Cook until milk evaporates, about 4 or 5 minutes. Stir in the
tomatoes. When sauce retums to a low botl, reduce heat and cook at a
very low simmer for 3 to 4 hours. Stir occasionally toward the end of
cooking. Before serving, stir in the cheese.

Htnt: Gentle cookmg is the key to a successful
ragu. Neither the vegetables nor the meat
should brown, and the entire sauce
should cook at a long, slow simmer.

If you're using this in a lasagne recipe that ends with a layer of
grated cheese, omit the cheese in this recipe.
