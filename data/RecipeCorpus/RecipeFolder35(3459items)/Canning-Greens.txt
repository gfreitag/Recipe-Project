You'll need all the basic equipment for steam pressure canning, plus a
large saucepan. This recipe is for the hot pack method only.

1. Choose freshly picked, young, tender greens.

2. Organize and prepare equipment and work area.

3. Wash greens thoroughly in several changes of water and pick over
carefully.

4. Cut out any tough stems and mid ribs.

5. Put greens in large saucepan with just enough water to prevent
sticking (usually the water that clings to the leaves is enough).
Heat just until greens are wilted, turning greens when steam begins
to rise around the edges of pan. Before packing, cut through greens
several times with a sharp knife or kitchen scissors.

6. pack hot cooked greens very loosely into hot pint or quart jars to
within 1 inch of tops. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to each pint jar, 1
teaspoon to each quart, if desired. Pour in boiling water to within 1
inch of top of jars.

7. Run a slim, non metal tool down along the inside of each jar to
release air bubbles. Add more boiling liquid to within 1 inch of tops.

8. Wipe tops and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth.

9. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

10. Process at 10 pound pressure, 1 hour and 10 minutes for pints, 1
hour and 30 minutes for quarts. follow manufacturer's directions for
your canner.

11. Follow basic steps for steam pressure canning, 10 through 24.
