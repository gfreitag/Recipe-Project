Categories: Vegetables, Cheese/eggs, Breakfast
Yield: 3 servings
MMMMM-----------------****** INGREDIENTS ******----------------------
1/3 c  Water
1/2 ts Salt
ds Pepper
3 tb Butter, divided
1 ea Tomato, sliced
1 pk (10-oz) frozen chopped
-broccoli, cooked and
-well-drained
1 pk (3-oz) cream cheese, cubed
1/4 ts Seasoned salt
6 ea Eggs
MMMMM------------------****** DIRECTIONS ******-----------------------
Add cheese and seasoned salt to hot broccoli; stir until cheese is
melted. Keep warm while preparing omelets. Mix eggs, water, salt and
pepper with fork. For each omelet: Heat 1 tablespoon butter in omelet
pan or skillet (approx. 8-inch) until just hot enough to sizzle a
drop of water. Pour in approximately 1/2 cup egg mixture. Mixture
should set at edges at once. With pancake turner [very large spatula
works well, too], carefully draw cooked portions at edges toward
center, so uncooked portions flow to bottom. Tilt pan as it is
necessary so uncooked eggs can flow. Slide pan rapidly back and forth
over heat to keep mixture in motion and sliding freely. While top is
still moist, place approximately 1/2 cup broccoli mixture on half of
omelet; top with 2-3 tomato slices. With pancake turner, fold in
half, turning out onto platter with a quick flip of the wrist. Makes
3 servings. <Best Recipes> Happy cooking! -Ed-
