Yield: 6 servings
-softened
1/4 ts Salt (optional)
1/4 ts Pepper
12 oz Fettuccine
1 1/2 c  Frozen peas
2 tb Chopped fresh chives or
-green onion
1 tb Butter
2 sm Clove garlic, minced
3    Green onions, chopped
1 tb Flour
1 c  Milk
2/3 c  Chicken or vegetable stock
4 oz Herbed cream cheese,
This mild herb flavored dish will please the pasta lover in all of us.
For a pretty color contrast, you might want to sprinkle it with
chopped sweet red pepper.  For a sophisticated touch, replace half
the herbed cream cheese with a creamy goat cheese, if desired.

In small saucepan, heat butter and cook the garlic and onions until
shiny and soft.  Sprinkle with the flour and stir to coat.  Pour in
the milk and the chicken stock, increasing temperature to medium.
Cook until starting to thicken.  Add the cheese and heat until melted.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.   Cook the pasta noodles
according to directions, drain and rinse with hot water. Return pasta
to pot and add the frozen peas.  Pour hot sauce over top of pasta and
stir until combined.  The heat from the sauce should be adequate
enough to thaw the peas and heat them prior to serving.  Arrange on
platter, sprinkle chives or green onions over top and serve
immediately.
