marinate for at least 4 hours in the refrigerator. Prepare a fire in
the grill using a combination of coals and pimento wood. If you don't
have pimento wood, substitute apple wood or hickory, or build a fire
with just charcoal. Place the chicken on the grill over white hot
coals. Jerk (cook) over a very slow fire for 1 to 1 1/2 hours,
turning over every 10 minutes or so.

The chicken takes on a very dark color when done. David's jerk
chicken is cooked over an open fire with the grill at a height of
about 1.5 feet above the fire. At no point is his grill closed.
YIELD: 6 Servings. Jerk Rub: Mix together all ingredients to make a
paste. A food processor fitted with a steel blade is ideal for this.
Store leftovers in the refrigerator in a tightly closed jar for about
a month.

YIELD: about 1 cup. From Helen Willinsky's book JERK Barbecue From
