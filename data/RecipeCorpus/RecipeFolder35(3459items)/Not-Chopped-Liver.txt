Title: Not Chopped Liver
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Cooked green peas *
1/4 c  Vegetable stock (approx)
1 tb (to 2 tbs)
-dried bread crumbs
Salt, black pepper
-and cayenne pepper
2    Eggs
1 tb Olive oil
1 sm Onion(s), finely chopped
1    Garlic clove(s)
-finely chopped
5 oz Mushrooms, finely chopped
-(2 cups before chopping)
* If using frozen peas, thaw but don't cook them.

1. Boil the eggs, starting with cold water, for 11 minutes. Rinse
under cold water and peel. Halve the eggs and remove the yolks,
reserving half of 1 yolk, discarding the remaining yolks. Coarsely
chop the whites.

2. Heat he olive oil in a non-stick fry pan. Cook the onion and
garlic over medium heat until soft but not brown, about 3 minutes.
Increase the heat to high and add the mushrooms. Cook until most of
the mushroom liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes.

3. Stir in the peas and vegetable stock and simmer until most of the
stock is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Stir in enough bread crumbs to
hold the mixture together. Coarsely purÂ‚e the mushroom mixture with
the hard-cooked egg white in the food processor and let cool. Correct
the seasoning, adding salt, pepper, or cayenne to taste.

4. Transfer the mixture to a bowl or serving plate. Push the reserved
half egg yolk through a sieve over the Not Chopped Liver or finely
chop it and sprinkle on top. Serve with saltine crackers or pita
chips.
