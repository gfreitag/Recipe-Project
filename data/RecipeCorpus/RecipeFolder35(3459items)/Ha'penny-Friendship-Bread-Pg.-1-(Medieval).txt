It may take 3 notes to do this entire recipe as should be done.

Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off. In large bowl,
combine 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast; blend well.

In small saucepan, heat water and oil until very warm (120-130
degrees F.). Add warm liquid to flour mixture. Blend at low speed
until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed.

Stir in additional 3 1/2 to 4 cups flour, until dough pulls cleanly
away from sides of bowl.

On floured surface, knead dough until smooth and elastic, about 10
mins. Place dough in greased bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap
and cloth towel. Let rise in warm place (80-85 degrees F.) until
light and doubled in size, about 1-1/2 hrs. Punch down dough several
times to remove air bubbles.  Allow to rest on board covered with
inverted bowl for 14 mins. Shape as desired.
