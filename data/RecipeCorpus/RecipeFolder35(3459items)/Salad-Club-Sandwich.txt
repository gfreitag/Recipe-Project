a fork so that the mayonnaise has a slightly chunky texture.  Set
aside.

Cook the turkey bacon over medium heat until just cooked through but
not too crispy.  Drain on paper towels.  Set aside.

Coat the avocado slices in the lemon juice to prevent discoloration.

Halve the rolls and scoop out some of the interior.  Spread both
sides of each bun with the bleu-cheese mayonnaise.  Lay egg slices
over the bottom halves.  Cover with the avocado slices and top evenly
with the chicken. Cover with the tomato slices and sprinkle with
chives.

Add two bacon slices to each, then a lettuce leaf and cover with the
tops of the buns.
