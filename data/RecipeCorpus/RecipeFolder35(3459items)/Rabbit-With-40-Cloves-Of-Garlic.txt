Categories: Game, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
Fresh
1/4 ts Dried rosemary -- or 1 sprig
Fresh
Garlic croutons -- recipe
Follows
Fresh parsley -- chopped
Red wine -- Cotes du Rhone
3 lb Rabbit -- cut into pieces
1    Bottle
2 tb Olive oil
Whole salt -- to taste
Ground pepper -- to taste
40    Cloves garlic -- unpeeled
1/4 ts Dried thyme -- or 4 sprigs
The day before you wish to serve this, place the rabbit in a
GLASS bowl and pour on the red wine.  Cover and
refrigerate overnight, turning the pieces once.  An hour
before cooking, remove the rabbit from the wine, and pat
dry with paper towels.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat the oil over medium  heat in a heavy-bottomed
flameproof casserole.  Add the rabbit and salt and pepper.
Saute for 5 minutes, then turn the pieces over and saute
another 5 minutes.  This can be done in batches.  Don't
worry if the pan scorches a bit;  it won't affect the flavor
of the dish.  Remove from the pot.

Add the garlic and saute, stirring, fro 5 minutes, until
beginning to brown.  Spread in a single layer and return
rabbit pieces to the pot.  Add the red wine, thyme, rosemary,
and more salt and pepper to taste, and cover tightly.

Place the pan in the oven and bake 1 hour or until the
rabbit pieces are falling away from the bone.

When the rabbit is very tender, remove pieces and the garlic
and place on a platter.  Place the pot over high heat and
reduce the wine until thick.  Pour over rabbit.  Sprinkle with
parsley and serve, placing a couple of croutons on each plate,
a piece of rabbit or two, and several garlic cloves, which are
to be squeezed out onto the croutons.

CROUTONS:  Slice French Baguette very thin (1/4-1/2 inch)
and brush slices with olive oil.  Place on a cookie sheet and
toast a few minutes in  350 degree oven.  This can be done
while sauteing rabbit.
