Title: Helen's Pumpkin Pudding
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ginger
1/2 ts Nutmeg
2    Eggs, beaten
1 1/2 c  Browned, strained pumpkin
2 tb All purpose flour
1 c  Brown sugar
2 c  Milk
1 c  Carnation 2% canned milk
This recipe calls for browned pumpkin which is accomplished by
buttering a heavy cast iron frying pan and cooking the 2 cups pumpkin
over medium heat, stirring and turning so all parts dry properly.
Keep this up til it is reduced to 1 1/2 cups.  It will be slightly
browned.

Place the browned pumpkin in a bowl, sprinkle with flour and brown
sugar and stir til thoroughly mixed.  Add spices and eggs and beat
well. Scald milk.  Add the canned milk to scalded milk.  Add milks to
pumpkin mixture Beat together til well mixed.

Place mixture in a greased casserole and place it in a larger
casserole with hot water that comes half way up the outside of inner
casserole. Place in a 325 F oven and oven poach til a knife comes out
clean when tested. Serve hot or cold.

This is actually my pumpkin pie filling, but I prefer it without the
pastry and it is better for me.  No great amount of fat in this one.
