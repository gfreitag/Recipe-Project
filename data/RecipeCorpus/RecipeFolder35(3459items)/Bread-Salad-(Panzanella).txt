This Tuscan salad makes a very satisfying lunch on a hot day.
Traditional versions call for the bread to be soaked first in water.
I like to use dry, crusty bread it adds delicious texture to the
salad.

3 cups cubed crusty bread (sourdough, French, or peasant bread) 6
small Italian plum tomatoes, cored, seeded, and diced 1 large
cucumber, seeded and diced 1 medium-size red onion, 0nely chopped 1/4
cup chopped fresh parsley Salt and freshly ground black pepper to
taste 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar

1. Preheat the oven to 350-F. Spread the bread cubes on an ungreased
jelly roll pan in a single layer and place in the oven for 10
minutes. Transfer to a large serving bowl and allow to cool slightly.

2. Add the tomatoes, cucumber, onion, and parsley, season with salt
and pepper, pour in the oil and vinegar, and toss well. Allow to
stand for at least 15 minutes before serving. Toss again and serve.
