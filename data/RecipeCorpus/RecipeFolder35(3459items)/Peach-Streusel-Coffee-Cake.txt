Combine the dough ingredients in the machine's bread pan, and turn the
machine on the RISE setting so that it will mix, knead, allow the
dough to rise once. Combine the filling ingredients and set the
filling aside. Stir the topping ingredients together until moist and
crumbly. Set the topping aside.

Roll the dough into a 12 x 8-inch rectangle on a lightly floured
surface. Transfer the dough to a baking sheet coated with cooking
spray. With a sharp knife, make 2-inch long cuts at 1-inch intervals
on both of the long, 12-inch sides. Spoon the filling down the center
third of the dough. Fold the strips diagonally over the filling,
overlapping the strips to create a braided look.

Brush the top of the coffee cake with skim milk and spread the
streusel topping over the loaf. Cover and let the dough rise in warm
place until doubled in bulk; about 45 mins. Bake at 350 F for 25
mins, until golden brown. Cover loosely with foil during last 10 mins
to prevent excess browning. Serve warm. This makes 12 servings.

For variety, substitute apples or pears for the peaches. To save
time, a 20-ounce can of peach-pie filling may be substituted for the
fresh peach filling.
