This recipe makes about nine 1/2 pint jars. You will need all the
basic equipment, in addition to a fine sieve.

1. Organize and prepare ingredients, equipment, and work area.

2. In a large preserving kettle, cook tomatoes, peppers, bay leaves,
and salt for 1 hour over medium heat, stirring occasionally.

3. Press through a fine sieve and return to kettle. Discard seeds and
bay leaves.

4. Add garlic, if used, and continue to cook over medium to medium low
heat, stirring frequently, until tomato mixture is thick enough to
mound on a spoon, about 2-1/2 hours. Remove garlic.

5. Pour hot paste into hot 1/2 pint jars to within 1/4 inch of tops.
Run a slim, non metal tool down along the insides of jars to release
any air bubbles. Add additional paste, if necessary, to within 1/4
inch of tops.

6. Wipe tops and threads of jars with damp clean cloth.

7. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

8. Process in a boiling water bath 45 minutes.

9. Follow basic steps for boiling water bath canning, 10 through 19.
