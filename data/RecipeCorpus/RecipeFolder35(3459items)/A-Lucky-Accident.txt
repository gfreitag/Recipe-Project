* This is what I happened to have on hand. Any canned tomatoes would
do.

** That's what I had leftover in the fridge. Use a 6oz can.

Put 3 quarts of water in the bottom of a large stock pot with a pasta
insert. Add the tomato liquid and tomato paste. Put all of the other
ingredients in the pasta insert. Bring to a boil over high heat,
lower the heat, cover and simmer for about 3 hours. Lift out the
pasta insert, letting out the liquid fall back into the pot. Press
down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible and return
all the liquid to the pot. Discard the solids.

Note: This started out to be vegetable stock to use up some leftover
stuff I had on hand, but after I strained the stock I decided to use
it as a cooking liquid for pasta. The pasta thickened and flavored
the stock to such an extent that I decided to save the leftovers to
use as a tomato-vegetable soup. I may add some vegetables and small
pasta to that. Submitted By DIANE LAZARUS   On   10-07-95
