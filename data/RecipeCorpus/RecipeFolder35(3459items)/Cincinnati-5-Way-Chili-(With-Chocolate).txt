MMMMM-------------------CONSTRUCTING THE CHILI------------------------
1 lb Cheddar cheese -- grated
-fine & fluffy
8 oz Very thick spaghetti
1    16 oz can Kidney beans
2    Onions -- chopped
Salt a large cast iron skillet.  Turn heat to medium and add meat,
onions and garlic.  Cook until meat is browned.  Add tomato sauce,
ketchup, water and vinegar.  As mixture begins to boil, add
everything else. Adjust spices to taste, adding more salt if it needs
perking up, more cinnamon, cloves and mace if you want it sweeter,
more chocolate for body. Cover and simmer at very low heat for about
one hour, stirring and tasting occasionally, adding tomato juice if
it's getting too dry to ladle up easily.

The bottom layer is always spaghetti.  Break it into 4 inch pieces and
boil in salted water with 2 tbsp. olive oil.  Melt some butter into
just cooked noodles.  Cover several plates (oval ones are
traditional) with spaghetti. Ladle on enough chili to cover the
spaghetti.  Wash and heat kidney beans with 2 cups of water, then
drain.  Spoon a sparse layer of the beans atop the chili.  Spread
onions out, to taste, over the beans. Quickly, so it will melt,
spread lots of grated cheese to cover everything.
