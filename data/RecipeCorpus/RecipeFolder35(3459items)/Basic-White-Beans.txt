Title: Basic White Beans
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 2 1/2 cups
2    Garlic clove(s)
A few parsley sprigs
A few thyme sprigs or
1/2 ts Dried thyme
1 ts Salt
1 c  Dried white beans
2 c  Water
1    Bay leaf
1/2 ts Black pepper
1    Unpeeled carrot, halved
1    Spanish onion, quartered
1. The night before, spread the beans in a large pan and remove and
small stones and bits of dirt.

2. Wash the beans by placing them in a bowl and covering them with
cold water. Let the beans settle to the bottom of the bowl. This
allows the dirt to float to the top. Pour off the water.

3. Cover the beans by 4-inches or more with cold water. Soak the
beans for 6-8 hours or overnight.

4. The next morning, pour off the water and place the soaked beans in
a pot with a tight-fitting lid. Add the cold water, bay leaf, pepper,
carrot, onion, and garlic. Tie the parsley and thyme in cheesecloth
and add it to the pot.

5. Cover and bring to a simmer over high heat. Turn the heat to low
and simmer slowly for 1 hour. Add the salt during the last 15 minutes
of cooking.

6. Remove the bay leaf, garlic, onion, carrot, parsley, and thyme.
Wring the cheesecloth out over the beans to extract as much flavor as
possible. Serve hot or at room temperature or use in any recipe that
calls for cooked white beans.

Can be prepared up to 4 days in advance. Refrigerate if you're
keeping them for longer than a few hours.
