1/4 ts Saffron infused in
1 tb Warm water
1 tb Tomato paste
1 ts Grated lemon zest
6 c  Vegetable stock

1/4 c  Cilantro

2 tb Olive oil

2 ts Coriander seeds
1 ts Turmeric
1 ts Cumin seeds
1    Cinnamon stick
1    Bay leaf
1/2 lb Potatoes, peeled
-cut in 3/4" dice (2 cups)
1/2 lb Winter squash, peeled
-cut in 3/4" dice (2 cups)
1/2 lb Parsnips, peeled
-cut in 3/4" dice (2 cups)
Note: Start with whole coriander and cumin seeds. Roast them in a dry
fry pan until very fragrant, then grind them in a spice mill.

1. Heat the olive oil in a large casserole pan. Add the onion and
cook over medium heat for 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic and ginger
and continue cooking for 2 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to
brown.

2. Stir in the coriander, turmeric, cumin, cinnamon stick, and bay
leave and cook for 1 minutes, or until the mixture is very fragrant.
Stir in the potatoes, squash, parsnips, chickpeas, apricots, prunes,
saffron, tomato paste, lemon zest, vegetable stock, salt and pepper,
and cayenne and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer,
uncovered, until the vegetables are tender but not soft, about 40-50
minutes. If the stew begins to dry out, add more stock. It should be
quite moist.

3. Just before serving, remove the cinnamon stick and bay leaf.
Correct the seasoning, adding, salt and pepper, cumin or cayenne to
taste. The stew should be highly seasoned. Sprinkle with the chopped
cilantro and serve at once. Tagines are traditionally served over
couscous with harissa as a accompaniment.
