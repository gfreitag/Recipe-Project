Title: Poisson Cru  (Tahitian Raw Fish Salad)
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Salads
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Tomato; coarsely chopped
1/2 bn Green onions; trimmed
.  and sliced
2 tb Chives or parsley; minced
2 ts Lime zest; grated
1 lb Yellowfin tuna
1/3 c  Lime juice
1/3 c  Coconut milk
pn Salt
1/2 c  Carrot; shredded or grated
1/2 c  Cucumber; thinly sliced
If red and yellow tomatoes are available, use some of each in this
recipe. Other herbs, red onions, slivered lettuces, diced bell
peppers and minced hot chilies are a few other ideas for additions
and/or alterations.

Sometimes a pinch of sugar is added to POISSON CRU to enhance the
sweetness of the dish, but this can be done to taste.  The recipe we
suggest here does not include sugar.

**  Directions  ** Cut the tuna into 1/2-inch thick strips about 2
inches long.

In a large, non-reactive bowl (such as glass), combine the lime juice,
coconut milk and salt and stir to mix.  Add the tuna, carrot,
cucumber, tomato, green onions, chives and lime zest.  Stir to mix
and taste for seasoning.  Serve right away.
