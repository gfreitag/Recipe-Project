1/8 ts Freshly ground pepper
Vegetable oil
1 ea 7 to 8 pound capon
1 ts Dried parsley flakes
3/4 ts Dried whole thyme

roasting pan; cover, and refrigerate overnight.
Brush capon with oil.  Insert meat thermometer in breast or meaty

degrees for 2-1/2 hours or until meat thermometer registers 185
degrees. Baste capon frequently with pan drippings. If capon gets too
brown, cover lightly with aluminum foil.  Capon is done when legs
move easily.
Transfer capon to serving platter; reserve pan drippings for gravy.
Let capon stand 20 minutes before serving.
