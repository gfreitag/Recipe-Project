Garam Masala is a mix of ground spices which have strong, but not
necessarily hot, flavours such as cinnamon, cloves and peppercorns.
It is used in many meat and vegetable dishes. This combination of
spices gives a medium strength mix.

Heat a heavy based pan then add the cardamom seeds, cumin seeds and
coriander seeds and cover with a lid. Shake over the heat for 1-2
minutes. Take care not to let the seeds burn in the pan and let them
cool before grinding.

Mix all the ingredients and grind to a fine powder using a coffee
grinder, food processor or pestle and mortar.

Store in an airtight jar.
