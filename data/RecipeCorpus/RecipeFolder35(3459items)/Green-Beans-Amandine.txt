Title: Green Beans Amandine
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
-stem ends removed
1 lg Garlic clove(s), minced
2 ts Olive oil
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
3 tb Chopped raw almonds
-or shiitake mushrooms
-(see note)
1 ts Melted butter
1/2 lb Green beans
1. Preheat the oven to 325øF.

2. Toss the almonds with the butter in a baking dish and roast until
they're dark brown, about 10 minutes. Set aside.

3. Steam the beans for 4-6 minutes until done.

4. While the beans are steaming, saut the garlic in the olive oil in
a large skillet over low heat. When the garlic just begins to turn
golden, add the salt and pepper and stir. Add the beans and stir
again for 1 minute. Sprinkle with the roasted almonds. Serve hot.

Note: Instead of topping the beans with roasted almonds, you can cut
fresh shiitake mushrooms into thin strips and brush them with olive
oil. Heat a wok or cast-iron skillet, add the mushrooms, then blacken
the mushrooms by cooking them over high heat for 1 minute on each
side. Scatter the blackened shiitakes over the green beans.
