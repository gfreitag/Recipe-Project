Categories: Fish/seafoo, Sandwich, Bbq/grill, Low cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Mango ketchup -- See Recipe
1/4 lb Spinach
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
1 ts Dill -- chopped
1    Loaf French bread
1 lb Fresh red snapper
3    Egg whites
2 tb Green onions -- chopped
1 tb White Worcestershire sauce
1 tb Thai fish sauce
NOTE:

This recipe calls for "Mango Ketchup" (the recipe is included in this
cookbook), which requires 24-hour advance preparation.

STEP ONE:

Chop the red snapper by hand or with a steel blade in a food
processor. Place the snapper into a large stainless steel bowl. Add
the egg white, worcestershire sauce, fish sauce, green onion, and
dill. Mix together well. Add to this mixture enough bread crumbs to
bind mixture together. Form into 4 burger shapes, 1/2-inch thick, and
let chill for about 1/2 hour in the refrigerator.

STEP TWO:

Heat a grill or broiler until very hot. Meanwhile, clean and dry the
spinach. Drizzle a little olive oil over the burgers just before
grilling. Grill the burger over high heat for about 1-1/2 minutes,
being careful not to overcook the fish.

STEP THREE:

Serve the burger immediately on French bread with the spinach leaves
and dressed with Mango Ketchup.
