Title: Gnarled Witches Fingers (Halloween)
Categories: Holiday, Poultry
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Bread crumbs
Pitted black olives --
Halved lengthwise
Shredded lettuce
1 tb Vegetable oil
4    Boneless chicken breasts
1 c  Flour
1    Egg -- beaten
Grease cookie sheet with oil, set aside.
Carefully cut chicken breasts partway to create five fingers (the
uncut part will be the palm of the hand).  Slice them a little
crooked for effect. Dust in flour, dip in egg, coat in bread crumbs,
broil 5 minutes each side til golden and cooked through.
Trim the tips with the olive fingernails and serve on lettuce.

Truth be known, I'm going to try shake'n'bake this year to ease my
meal prep time on this busy, busy day of the year.
