Title: Jenny Chips
Categories: Snacks, Low cal/fat
Yield: 80 chips
2 ts Extra-virgin olive oil
-or as needed
Salt and pepper
2 lg Baking potatoes
-well scrubbed
Spray oil
1. Preheat the oven to 350Ã¸F.

2. Thinly slice the potatoes no more than 1/8-inch thick. Blot the
potato slices dry.

3. Lightly spray the back of a baking sheet with spray oil. Arrange
the potatoes on top of the sprayed surface in a single layer and
lightly brush them with olive oil. Season the slices with salt and
pepper.

4. Bake the chips until golden brown, 15-20 minutes. Transfer to a
cake rack to cool.

Note1: If you have a non-stick baking sheet, you can omit the spray
oil.

Note2: If you have any chips left over the next few days and they
become soggy, simply bake them again for a few minutes and they'll
regain their crispness as they cool.
