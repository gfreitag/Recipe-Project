1 1/2 c  Flour

1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1    Egg -- lightly beaten
2 tb Margarine, lowfat
1/2 c  Plus 2Tbl Milk, nonfat
1 1/4 c  Raspberries
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.

BATTER:
Sift flour, sugars, baking powder, salt and cinnamon together into a
medium size bowl and make a well in the center. Place the egg, melted
margarine and milk in the well. Stir with a wooden spoon just until
ingredients are combined. Quickly stir in the raspberries and lemon
zest. Fill each muffing cup three-fourths full with the batter.

STREUSEL:
Combine all streusel ingredients in a bowl and stir to combine.
Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the top of each muffin. Bake until
nicely browned and firm, about 20 to 25 minutes.

GLAZE:
Mix sugar and lemon juice. Drizzle over warm muffins with a spoon.

Best if served warm, and the same day they are made.

If you are watching Cholesteral, use 1/4 cup Egg Beaters instead of
whole egg.

If you use frozen berries, use unsweetened and drain them well. If you
cannot find unsweetened frozen berries, cut granulated sugar in
batter to 1/8 cup.
