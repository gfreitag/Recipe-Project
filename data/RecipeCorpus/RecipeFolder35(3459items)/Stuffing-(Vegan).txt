Categories: Side dish, Holiday
Yield: 1 servings
;black pepper to taste
;ground sage to taste
1 lg Bag pepperidge farms
-whole wheat/white bread
-stuffing cubes, the ones
-with no seasoning
Veg broth to add moisture
-if needed 1-2c
1 c  Onions; chopped
1/2 c  Onions; pureed
2 c  Celery; chopped
1 c  Celery; pureed
1 c  Carrots; chopped or grated
1 lb Mushrooms; or 8oz canned
-mushrooms, sliced
2 tb Dried parsely
1 ts Old bay seasoning
Heat onions, celery, shrooms and spices in a large pot until it all
boils. Simmer about 5-10 mins or until the chopped onions are
translucent.  Cool for 10 mins, then add stuffing mix.
Mix well, adding broth if necessary for moisture.  Place in a big
covered baking dish and cook in a preheated 350 oven for 30 mins.
Take cover off during last 10-15 mins to crisp top.

Lucinda's notes:  This is a very sticky, moist stuffing--just how I
like it. Those of you who prefer the top to be crispy can bake it
uncovered for the last few mins, OR broil the top til crispy.
You can probably add some of the vegetarian Italian sausage that
comes in links browned first for a more traditional taste.  Add
chopped apples, chopped spiach, or any other vegetable you like can
probably be added. Even my father in law, diehard New Englander and
meat-and-potatoes man, liked this.
