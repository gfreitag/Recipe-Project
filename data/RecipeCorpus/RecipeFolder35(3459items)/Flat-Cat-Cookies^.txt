Spatula
with an adult's help, preheat oven to temperature specified on
package.

Sprinkle flour on a clean, flat surface and roll out cookie dough
slightly thicker than what the package calls for. then, using butter
knife, cut out cookies in the shape of a flattened cat. Use a large
spatula to carefully transfer cookies to cookie shee

Bake according to package directions. While they're cooling, count out
enough cinnamon candies to put two eyes and a nose on each cat.
Carefully flatten between the front and bakdof two spoons and set
aside.

Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheet for about 3 minutes and
then press in eyes and nose. Transfer to wire rack to continue
cooling. Dribble jam here and there on each cookie for blood. Makes
approximately 3 dozen kitty road kill (HEY BODLE!!!!!)

Sicko serving suggestion: Instead of making each cookie in a perfect
cat shape, make a few that are missing a limb and/or tail. Why not
even sever a head or two? Drip jam blood at stumps for an
authentically dismembered look?
