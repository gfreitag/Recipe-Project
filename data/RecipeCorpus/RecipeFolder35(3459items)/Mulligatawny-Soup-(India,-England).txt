============================
This Indian soup, the name which means "pepper water", originated as
a simple broth seasoned with a sharp curry mixture. However, the
English living in India preferred a more hearty soup, so they added
mutton and vegetables to the well seasoned broth.
Since mutton is not always appreciated by everyone, a version
substituting chicken for mutton was developed. The chicken
adaptation had found favor on the European continent and even
Austrailia. Today Mulligatawny sometimes appear on menus as thin
clear soup and sometimes as a very thick stewlike dish flavored
with curry and made with meat, or more often chicken. A variety of
other ingredients such as rice, apple, egg and lemon juice are
usually added.
