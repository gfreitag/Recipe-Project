Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM--------------------------CARAMEL-------------------------------
1/2 c  Water
1 1/2 c  Sugar
MMMMM----------------------------FLAN---------------------------------
6    Eggs
1 c  Pumpkin
12 oz Evaporated milk
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Water
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Ginger
To prepare the caramel, combine the sugar and water in a heavy
bottomed saucepan and cook over medium heat without stirring until it
caramelizes into a rich amber color, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from
the heat immediately to stop the cooking.  Pour equal amounts of the
liquid caramel into a 9" cake or pie pan.  Set aside.  Preheat the
oven to 350.  In the bowl of a standing electric mixer, using the
whisk attachment, combine the sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg and
ginger.  Begin mixing at moderate speed and add the eggs.  When the
eggs are well mixed, about 1 minute, add the pumpkin. Continue mixing
for 30 seconds until the eggs and pumpkin are incorporated. With the
mixer still running, add teh evaporated milk, vanilla and water;
continue blending for an additional 1 minute until you have a smooth
mass. Pour into prepared pan.  PLace in a deep-sided roasting pan and
pour in hot tap water to reach halfway up the sides of the pan. Cover
the roasting pan with foil and carefully transfer to the middle shelf
of the oven. Bake for 60 to 75 minutes.  The cooked flan will jiggle
slightly when shaken and a paring knife inserted in the center will
come out clean. Remove the pan from the water and set aside to cool.
Once cooled, refrigerate the flan until well chilled to allow it to
set. To serve, unmold the flan by running the point of a small paring
knife along the inside of the pan. Cover with a chilled plate and
invert.  The caramel should spill out to form a sauce for the flan.
Garnish with cinnamon-flavored whipped cream if desired.
