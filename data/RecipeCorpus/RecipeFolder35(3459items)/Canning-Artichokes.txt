Artichoke hearts are a real treat out of season. They're precooked and
canned in an acid solution, so you'll need a large kettle as well as
the basic equipment for steam pressure canning.

1. Choose evenly sized, uniformly green artichokes, with a compact
globe shape and tightly closed leaves.

2. Organize and prepare equipment and work area.

3. Remove outer leaves of each artichoke until you come to light
yellow or white leaves or brats. Cut off tops of buds and trim heart
and stem to a cone shape. Wash each heart in cold water as soon as
you've finished trimming it. Drain.

4. Cook artichoke hearts for 5 minutes in a large kettle of boiling
water mixed with 3/4 cup vinegar per gallon. Drain.

5. Pack hearts into hot pint or quart jars to within 1 inch of tops.

6. Prepare canning liquid of 1 gallon water, 3 tablespoons salt, and
3/4 cup vinegar or lemon juice; bring to boil. Pour boiling canning
liquid into jars to within 1 inch of tops; make sure hearts are
covered.

7. Run a slim, non metal tool down along the inside of each jar to
release air bubbles. Add more boiling liquid to within 1 inch of tops.

8. Wipe tops and threads of jars with damp clean cloth.

9. Put on lids and bands as manufacturer directs.

10. Process at 10 pounds pressure, 25 minutes for quarts and pints.
Process very large hearts 10 minutes longer, Follow manufacturers
directions for your canner.

11. Follow basic steps for steam pressure canning, 10 thru 24.
