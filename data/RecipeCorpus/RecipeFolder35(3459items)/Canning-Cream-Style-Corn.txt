Title: Canning Cream Style Corn
Categories: Can/preserv, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
-Makes 2 pints
3 lb To 6 lb corn in husks
You don't add real cream to the kernels; the cream is juice from the
cob that you scrape off with the back of a knife. You'll need all the
basic equipment. Pick corn in small quantities (2 to 3 dozen ears at
a time) and rush it to the kitchen. This recipe calls for pint jars
only.

1. Home grown, very fresh corn is best. Work with small quantities, 2
or 3 dozen ears at a time.

2. Organize and prepare equipment and work area.

3. Husk corn and remove all silk. Wash corn well.

4. Cut corn from cob at about center of kernel.

5. Scrape cobs with back of a knife to remove "cream." Mix cream with
corn.

6. COLD PACK: Pack corn and cream into hot jars to within 1 inch of
tops. Don't shake or press down; corn needs room to expand as it
cooks. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to each jar, if desired. Pour in boiling
water to within 1 inch of tops of jars. HOT PACK: Measure corn and
cream into a large saucepan or pot and add 1-1/2 pints boiling water
for each quart of cream corn. Heat to boiling and boil 3 minutes.
Pack corn and cooking liquid into hot pint jars to within 1 inch of
tops. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to each jar, if desired.

7. Run a slim, non metal tool down along the inside of each jar to
release air bubbles. Add more boiling liquid to within 1 inch of tops.

8. Wipe tops and thread of jars with a damp clean cloth.

9. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

10. Process at 10 pound pressure, 1 hour and 35 minutes for cold
packed pints, 1 hour and 25 minutes for hot packed pints. follow
manufacturers directions for your canner.

11. Follow basic steps for steam pressure canning, 10 through 24.
