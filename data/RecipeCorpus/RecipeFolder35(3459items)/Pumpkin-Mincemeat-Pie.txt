=========================================

Probably my favorite, this pie has the nifty addition of a mincemeat
layer which gives a delcious, tangy flavor and nutty texture.

2 ea Eggs
3/4 c Light Cream
1/2 c Brown Sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon; ground
1/2 ts Ginger; ground
1/4 ts EACH: Ground Cloves and Salt
1 c Mincemeat 9 in Unbaked Pie Shell

In bowl, whisk together pumpkin puree, eggs, cream, brown sugar,
cinnamon, ginger, cloves and salt. Spread mincemeat over bottom of
pie shell; top with pumpkin mixture. Bake in preheated 375F oven
about 45 minutes, or until pumpkin is set in center. Makes 6 servings.
