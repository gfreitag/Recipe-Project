1/4 ts Turmeric
1/4 ts Ground chillies

1 md Cauliflower; 450g florets
5 tb Vegetable oil

Boil the potatoes in their jackets and let them cool completely. (Day
old cooked potatoes that have been refrigerated work very well for
this dish) Peel the potatoes and cut them into 2 cms dice.
Break up the cauliflower into chunky flowerets, around 4 cms
across at the head, and around 4 cms in length. soak the florets 30
mins in water then blanch 4 minutes and refresh. Drain.
Heat the oil in a large preferably non stick frying pan over
moderate heat. When good and hot, add the whole cummin seeds and let
them sizzle 3-4 seconds. now put in the well drained cauliflower
florets and stir fry for about 2 minutes. Let the caulflower brown in
spots. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer for around 4-6 minutes or
until the cauliflower is almost done but still "al dente". Put in the
diced potatoes, and other ingredients. Stir gently to mix. Continue
to cook uncovered on low heat for another 3 minutes or until potatoes
are heated through. Stir gently as you do so. Correct seasoning and
serve.
