Yield: 4 servings
-salt and pepper
8    Scallions, washed and
-trimmed to the length
-of the fish
1    Stick (8 oz) butter/marg
Juice of 1 lemon
12 lg Fresh sage leaves
1 c  Whole hazelnuts (wild
-if available)
6    Slices smoked country
-style bacon
4    Trout (about 8oz. each)
-with head left on
S & P to taste
Flour seasoned with
Spread hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast in a preheated 350'F oven
about 15 minutes or until the skins split. Place them in a dish and
cover with plastic wrap until they cool, then rub them inside a towel
to remove as much skin as possible. Chop medium.

Cook bacon in a large heavy skillet until crisp, reserving the
drippings in the skillet. Drain bacon. Salt and pepper the cavity of
the trout. Dredge the trout in the seasoned flour. Place 2 trimmed
scallions in the cavity of each fish. Heat bacon drippings in skillet
and fry the trout about 6 minutes each side.

In a small saucepan, heat together the butter, lemon juice and sage
leaves. Spoon the lemon sage butter over the trout and sprinkle with
the hazelnuts and crumbled bacon.

This works well with any white, fine fleshed, mild fish. I have used
it with whiting with good results. I have substituted other nuts as
well with `some' success. To cut down on the fat content I have
replaced half the butter with fish stock and then thickened slightly
with a little cornstarch or arrowroot. Enjoy!!! later mike
