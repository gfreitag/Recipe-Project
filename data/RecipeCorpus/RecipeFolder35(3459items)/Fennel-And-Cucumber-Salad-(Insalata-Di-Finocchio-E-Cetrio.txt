The aromatic anise flavor of the finocchio gives this refreshing
salad its distinctive taste. Serve this as a first course in
combination with one or more other salads or antipasti.

1 medium-size fennel bulb, stalks and leaves removed 1 large cucumber,
peeled 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil Juice of 1 lemon 1 clove
garlic, minced or pressed 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley Salt and
freshly ground black pepper to taste

1. Cut the fennel bulb in half lengthwise and slice across the bulb as
thinly as possible, preferably in a food processor fitted with a
slicing disk or with a mandoline. Cut the cucumber in half
lengthwise, cut out and discard the seeds, and slice crosswise as
thinly as possible.

2. Combine the sliced fennel and cucumber in a medium-size serving
bowl. Add the oil, lemon juice, garlic, and parsley and season with
salt and pepper. Toss well to combine, cover, and allow to stand for
at least an hour at room temperature, stirring occasionally, before
serving.
