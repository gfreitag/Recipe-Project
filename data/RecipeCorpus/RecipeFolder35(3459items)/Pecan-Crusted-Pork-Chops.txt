Any kind of nuts can be substituted for the pecans. Try walnuts,

lightly golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool and then chop finely. Place
in a shallow bowl and add salt and pepper. Stir to mix well. Raise
oven temperature to 375~.
Place flour in another shallow bowl. In a third bowl, whisk eggs until
well blended.
Coating evenly and completely at each step, first dip chops, one at a
time, into flour, shaking off any excess. Then dip into egg and then
into finely chopped pecans.
In a large ovenproof frying pan over medium heat, melt butter. Add
chops in a single layer and cook uncovered, turning once, until
golden on both sides, 5 to 6 minutes total. Place frying pan in the
oven and continue to bake until firm to the touch and pale pink when
cut in the center, 10 to 12 minutes; do not allow the nut coating to
burn. Transfer chops to a warmed platter and garnish with parsley
sprigs. Serve immediately.
Serves 6.
