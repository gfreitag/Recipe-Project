Oven poaching is not traditional, but it cooks the pears gently and
evenly, and infuses them with a fantastic amount of flavor.

1 cup sugar 3 cups dry Italian red wine, such as Chianti or Spanna
Rind of 1 lemon, coarsely chopped 6 pears (Bosc, Bartlett, or
Comice), preferably with stems and all about the same size, or 12
Seckle pears

1. Preheat the oven to 300-F.

2. Combine the sugar, wine, and rind in a heavy casserole large
enough to hold the pears in a single layer. Place over medium-low
heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved.

3. Peel the pears, leaving them whole with the stems on. Place the
pears in the pot with the sugar-and-wine mixture and add enough water
(1 to 2 cups) to bring the liquid up to the tops of the pears. Cover
the casserole and place in the oven. Bake for 3 hours, or until the
pears are tender when pierced with a sharp knife. Allow the pears to
cool to room temperature, then chill for several hours before serving.

Note: For a thick, syrupy sauce for the pears, remove the pears from
the pot once they cool and set them in a serving bowl or in
individual serving dishes. Place the casserole on the stove over
medium-high heat, bring the wine mixture to a boil, and cook briskly
for 5 to 7 minutes, until the mixture is thick and syrupy. Pour the
syrup over the pears, allow to cool, and refrigerate before serving.
