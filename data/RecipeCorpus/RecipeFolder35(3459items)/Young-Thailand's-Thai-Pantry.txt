[From Young Thailand
-Cookbook by Wandee Young]
Tiny pointed Thai bird chiles look cut but pack a searing punch. Red
and green chiles (both dangerous) are usually sold in small plastic
bags. C O C O N U T  M I L K ====================== Cans of
unsweetened coconut milk are becoming widely avaailable. Young uses
Aroy brand. B A S I L ========= Thai basil is grey-green with a
narrow leaf. It's flavor is more intense than western basil. C O R I
A N D E R ================= These droopy green leaves go into many
Thai sauces and decorate every dish. F I S H S A U C E
=================== This dark potent sauce (nam pla), sold in tall
bottles, is drained from fish fermented with salt. It's a staple of
Thai and Vietnamese cooking. A spoonful flavors most dishes. F R I E
D T O F U =================== You'll find these golden pre-fried
squares of beancurd in the refrigerated section of an Asian
supermarket. G A L A N G A L =============== This aromatic relative
of ginger is sliced, unpeeled into Thai soups. L E M O N G R A S S
=================== These pale green stalks are an essential
ingredient in Thai dishes. They give off a distinctive lemony flavor
when crushed and sliced. L I M E L E A F ================ You'll find
kaffir lime leaves floating in soups or finely shredded. These dried
leaves must be soaked in cold water 20 minutes before use. Like
lemongrass, they're tought o chew. Substitute 1 tablespoon lime
juice. O Y S T E R   S A U C E ======================= This satiny
dark brown sauce is made from soy sauce, oyster extract, sugar and
thickener. Young recommendsthe Panda brand. R I C E S T I C K S
===================== Don'tbe intimidated by all the foreign writing
on these clear packages of clear rice noodles. For pad thai you'll
need the wider noodles, which look like dry linguine. Wandee preferes
Ivory brand. Rice noodles should be soaked in cold water, then
quickly boiled or stir fried. T A M A R I N D =============== This
sweet-and-sour fruit comes from a fuzzy light brown pod. The pulp
(with seeds) is sold in a flat square as tamarind paste. It must be
mixed with water and strained before using. Source: "Thai
