-coarsely chopped (1 cup)
3 c  Bok choy, napa and
-other Chinese vegetables
-coarsely chopped
2    Dried Chinese or Japanese
-black shiitake mushrooms
2 tb Soy sauce or to taste
10 c  Water (or as needed)

1 bn Cilantro, with stems
1. Tie the star anise and Sichuan peppercorns in a piece of
cheesecloth or wrap them in a piece of foil and pierce all over with
a fork

2. combine the onion, carrot, scallions, garlic, ginger, cilantro,
Chinese vegetables, shiitakes, soy sauce, and water in a large
stockpot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered,
adding water as necessary to keep the vegetables submerged, for 1
hour, or until the vegetables are very tender.

3. Remove the spice bundle and black mushrooms. Discard the former and
reserve the latter for stuffings. For a clear stock, strain the
liquid into another container, pressing with the back of a spoon to
extract the juices, then refrigerate of freeze. Refrigerated stock
will keep for 3-4 days; frozen it will keep for 6 months. For a
thicker, richer stock, pure the liquid and vegetables, then strain.

Note: Use for Asian-style soups and stir-fries. To make a wonderful
Asian vegetable soup, discard the bouquet garni and pure the broth
and vegetables in a blender. Season with soy sauce and pepper and
serve.

Makes 8 cups soup.
