* Shrimp must be pre-cooked before using.

Use a 10 ounce package of tiny mixed vegetables if preferred. Precook
and drain before using.

Drain and rinse the canned crab, or use fresh precooked. Melt the
margarine in a skillet and saute the onions and celery. Cook about 5
minutes or until vegetables are limp and onion is translucent. Stir
in the flour and blend well. Remove from heat and stir in the milk
gradually.

Return to heat and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is
thickened, about 2-3 minutes.

Add peas, crab, shrimp, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, salt and
black pepper. Heat thoroughly but do not boil. Remove from heat and
add cheese, stirring until melted. Return to heat if needed to melt
cheese completely but DO NOT boil.

To serve, heat pastry puffs until warm, fill with sauce mixture and
sprinkle capers on top.
