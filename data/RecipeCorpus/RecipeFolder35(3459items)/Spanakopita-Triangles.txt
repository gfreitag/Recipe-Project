Title: Spanakopita Triangles
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Dill weed
3 pk Frozen spinach -- thawed
Nutmeg -- to taste
1 pk Phyllo dough -- room temp.
2 c  Butter -- melted
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Onion -- chopped fine
2    Eggs
12 oz Feta cheese -- crumbled
1/2 c  Parsley -- minced
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Heat oil in small skillet.  Add onion and cook until translucent and
golden. Squeeze spinach dry. Beat eggs in a large bowl until light and
lemon colored. Stir in cooked onion, feta, parsley, dill, and spinach.
Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.

Remove phyllo from package; unroll and place on large sheet of waxed
paper. Fold Phyllo crosswise into thirds.  Use scissors to cut along
folds into thirds.  Cover with another sheet of waxed paper and a
damp cloth.  Lay 1 strip of phyllo at a time on a flat surface and
brush immediately with melted butter.  Fold strip in half lengthwise.
Brush with butter again. Place rounded teaspoonful of filling on one
end of strip; fold over one corner to make a triangle.  Continue
folding end to end, as you would fold a flag, keeping edges straight.
Brush top with butter. Repeat process until filling is used up.

Place triangles in a single layer, seam sides down, on ungreased
jelly roll pan.  Bake about 20 minutes or until lightly brown.  Serve
warm.
