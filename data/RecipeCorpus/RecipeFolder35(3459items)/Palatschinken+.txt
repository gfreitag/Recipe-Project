Title: Palatschinken+
Categories: Jewish, Aust/german, Breakfast
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 c  Apricot or strawberry jam
1 tb Brandy
MMMMM---------------------------CREPES--------------------------------
1 c  Milk
2    Eggs
1 c  Flour
pn Salt
2 tb Sugar
MMMMM-----------------------TO COOK CREPES----------------------------
Butter as needed
Stir the brandy into the jam and set aside.

Sift the flour into a bowl along with the salt and sugar. Gradually
add the milk, to make a smooth batter. Add the lightly beaten eggs
and stir again until the batter is once more smooth.

Heat a 9 inch skillet (nonstick would be perfect) and pour in just
enough melted butter to cover the whole surface of the pan when the
pan is tilted. Pour in enough batter to cover the pan thinly, but
completely. *Tip-Kind of rotate the pan just after batter is poured
in to spread the batter all around quickly. It's really easy and
after a couple crepes you'll be an expert! Cook the crepe over medium
heat until the underside is lightly browned and the pancake is firm.
Turn the crepe over and brown it lightly on the other side. Don't
overcook as they can become stiff. Tranfer the crepe to a platter and
cover with a thin coating of the jam. Roll it up neatly, place it on
an ovenproof or silver platter and keep it warm in a 250 degree oven
with a tea towel placed over the top. Repeat this procedure until all
the batter is used, laying the Palatschinken side by side or stacking
them like logs. Dust the finished Palatschinken generousely with
vanilla sugar or powdered sugar and serve.

In Vienna, oftentimes, this was served as a meal but nowadays we
usually serve it as a Sunday brunch.
