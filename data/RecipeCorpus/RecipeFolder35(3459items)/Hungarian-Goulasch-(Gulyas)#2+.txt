Title: Hungarian Goulasch (Gulyas)#2+
Categories: East europe, Hungarian, Main dish, Meats, Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Water
2 lb Beef (rump, round or chuck)
-lamb or veal is nice too
1 c  Sweet red and green pepper
-chunks (or peppers of your
-choice)
Salt to taste
2 ts Dried marjoram
1 ts Caraway seeds
1 ts Lemon zest
1 cl Garlic
3/4 c  Butter
1 tb Tomato paste
1 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
2 lb Onions, sliced
Crush together the marjoram, caraway, garlic and lemon zest.

In a large kettle, combine the butter (or fat of your choice), 1 tb.
tomato paste, the crushed seasonings and the sliced onions. Saute the
onions, stirring all the while, until the onions are golden. Add the
paprika, stir and saute 30 seconds longer. Add the beef, lamb or
veal, (cut in uniform chunks), the water and salt to taste. Cover the
kettle tightly and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is
tender. Add a bit more water during cooking, only if it is necessary.
Just before the goulasch is done, add 1/2 cup more water and let the
sauce boil up once more. If more sauce is preferred, sprinkle it with
1/4 cup flour just before the water is added at the end and add 1
more cup of water.

Serve the goulasch with speaetzle, noodles or boiled potatoes. Our
personal preferance (and one that is commonly used in Vienna) is
zemmel knoedle (kaiser roll dumplings.)

In Hungary, slivered grteen peppers are sprinkled on this gulyas. It
may also be sprinkle with bits of sweet red pepper.

This recipe was carefully put together by studying several gulyas
recipes and eating many variations of it in Vienna where the
Riemermans fell in love with the dish. You can still play with it as
we are as we intend to keep doing.

The best one I ever had was at the Prater in Vienna. It was lamb,
served with a not so hot long pickled pepper, a large semmel knoedle,
and a half a weiner, mysteriousely cut to look like a swan.
