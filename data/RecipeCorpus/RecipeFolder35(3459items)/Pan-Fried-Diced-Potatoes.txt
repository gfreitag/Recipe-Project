Title: Pan-Fried Diced Potatoes
Categories: Potatoes
Yield: 4 servings
Salt
1 1/2 lb Waxy boiling potatoes
Vegetable oil
1. Peel the potatoes and cut them into «-inch dice. Wash them in two
changes of cold water and pat dry.

2. Choose a skillet that can loosely accommodate all the potatoes.
Pour in «-inch oil and turn the heat to moderately high. When the oil
is hot, add all the diced potatoes and lower the heat to moderate.
Cook until tender when pierced but still pale, not having yet formed
a crust. Remove from the heat. Using a slotted spoon, remove the
potatoes to a plate and let cool completely, reserving the oil in the
pan.

heat. When the oil is hot, return the potatoes to the pan and cook
until light brown and crusty on all sides. Transfer the potatoes to a
warm platter, sprinkle with salt and serve.
