Title: Coquille Of Lobster Savannah
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Locke-Ober Cream Sauce --
See Recipe
1/2 c  Pimientos -- diced
4    3-pound Lobsters -- boiled &
-cooled
4 ts Parmesan cheese -- grated
2 oz Butter
2 c  Mushrooms -- sliced
1 c  Bell peppers -- diced
1 tb Spanish paprika
1 1/2 c  Sherry
1 ds Salt -- to taste
1 ds Black pepper -- to taste
NOTE: If you are using lobsters smaller than three pounds each, you
will need enough smaller lobsters to produce a total of about 8 cups
of meat after boiling and cooling.

STEP ONE: The Sauce-- Heat butter to melting point in a large
saucepan, add mushrooms and green pepper. Cook until tender. Add
paprika and stir in sherry. Cook until liquid is reduced by half.
Salt and pepper to taste; add cream sauce (see recipe for "Locke-Ober
Cream Sauce" included in this cookbook) and pimientos and blend well.
Bring to a simmer.

STEP TWO: The Lobster-- This can be done while vegetables are cooking.
Remove claws and knuckles from lobster. Hold lobster with its top
side up. With kitchen shears, cut an oval opening in top of shell
from tip of tail to base of head. Remove meat from body, claws, and
knuckles. Cut in a large dice.

CHEF'S NOTE: Discard intestinal vein and stomach--a hard sac near the
head--before dicing.

STEP THREE: Add meat to sauce and simmer slowly for 10 minutes. Divide
mixture evenly and spoon mixture in scallop shells or ovenproof
dishes with a piping of Duchesse potatoes around the edge. Dust with
grated parmesan cheese and brown in a 375-degree F oven for 15
minutes. Serve.
