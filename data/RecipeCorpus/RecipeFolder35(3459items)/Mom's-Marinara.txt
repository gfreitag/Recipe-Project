Title: Mom's Marinara
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Italian, Pasta/rice
Yield: 1 batch
.  2 16oz cans peeled
.  Italian tomatoes
1/4 ts Dried red pepper flakes
1/2 c  Italian parsley; chopped
or
1/2 c  Olive oil
2 cl Garlic; minced or chopped
2 lb Tomatoes; fresh, peeled &
.  chopped
.
**  NOTE:  to peel tomatoes, drop them into boiling water for 30
seconds. The skins will then slip off easily.

Heat the oil in a large skillet and saute garlic over low heat for a
few minutes, until golden.  Add the remaining ingredients and simmer,
stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.  Or if you prefer a smoother
sauce, push the ingredients through a sieve after they've cooked
about 15 minutes, then return the mixture to the skillet and continue
cooking.

*************** Additions and/or Alterations to the Marinara Sauce

For a touch of fragrance and sweetness, add 1/4 cup chopped fresh
basil leaves with the tomatoes and a pinch of sugar (unless using
canned tomatoes with the sugar added).

For a mysteriously rish flavor, stir in 2 or 3 minced anchovy fillets
before adding the tomatoes.  Use as many as 6 fillets for a strong
anchovy flavor.

For additional flavor, saute 1 finely chopped carrot, onion and celery
stalk with the garlic, before adding the tomatoes.  Puree the
ingredients in a food processor after they've cooked about 15
minutes, then return to the skillet and continue to cook for an
additional 15 minutes.

For shrimp or red clam sauce, add 1 pound of shelled and deveined
shrimp for the last few minutes of cooking (until the shrimp turn
opaque), or 2 6 1/2oz cans of minced clams.

*************** NOTE: When pasta is oversauced, it loses its own
distinctive flavor. Pasta sauce is meant to compliment, not
overpower, the pasta it's served with.
