Title: Decorator Pie Shell   (part 1)
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 1 9" shell
.  cut into 1/4-inch pats
2 tb Vegetable shortening; chilld
3 tb Ice water
1 1/2 c  Flour; all-purpose
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Sugar
6 tb Butter; unsalted, chilled &
**  Making the Dough  ** 1. Combine the flour, salt and sugar in a
medium-sized bowl.  Scatter butter pats and shortening over the
mixture and cut it with fingertips or a pastry blender until the
mixture resembles coarse meal.

2.  Drizzle 3 Tbsp of the water over the mixture.  Using the blade of
a rubber spatula, cut the mixture into little pieces.  Press down
with the broad side of the spatula so pieces stick together in larger
clumps. If the dough resists gathering, sprinkle the remaining water
over the dry, crumbly patches and press a few more times.  Form the
dough into a ball. Wrap it in plastic wrap, flatten into a 4-inch
disk, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.

**  Lining the Pie Plate  ** 1. Unwrap the dough and place on a
floured surface.  Dust the top with flour. Roll the dough in all
directions, from center to edges. When the disk is 9-inches in
diameter, flip over and continue rolling in all directions until 13
to 14 inches in diameter and 1/8-inch to 3/16-inch thick.

2.  Fold the dough in quarters.  Lay in a 9-inch Pyrex pie plate with
the folded corner at the center.  Gently unfold, draping the excess
over the plate lip.  Trim the excess to an even 1/2 to 1/4-inch all
around. If making applique-type decorations, retain the excess dough
for this use.

3.  Tuck the overhanging dough back under itself so the folded edge
overhangs the plate by 1/8-inch; press lightly to seal.  Select the
decorative edge and follow the accompanying instructions.

**  Baking the Crust  ** 1. To firm up the shell, refrigerate for 20
minutes.  Prick the bottom and sides at 1/2-inch intervals. Flatten a
12-inch square of aluminum foil inside the shell, pressing it flush
against the sides and over the rim. Cover any exposed sections of rim
with strips of foil. Prick the foil bottom in ten or twelve places.
Chill at least 30 minutes (preferably 1 hour or more).

2.  Heat the oven to 400Ã¸F.  Bake the shell for 15 minutes, pressing
down gently on the foil with a mitt-protected hand to flatten the
puffs. Start preparing the filling of your choice while the shell is
baking. Remove the foil and bake the shell for 8 to 10 minutes
longer. Pour warm filling into the hot pie shell and bake as directed.

*********************************** ** Making the Decorative Edges **
*********************************** Dough manipulation is the quickest
technique because you're working with the existing dough. The applique
method requires more working time since you must shape separate
pieces of dough before attaching them to the rim. Once your shapes
are molded or cut, arrange them around the rim and press down gently
to assure adhesion.

**  Button  ** Roll marble-sized balls of dough between your palms,
then flatten them slightly as you position them around the rim.

**  Crisscross  ** Place narrow 2-inch long strips cut from rolled
dough around the rim, slanting in one direction. Add a second tier
slanting in the opposite direction to create the crisscross pattern.
Tuck the ends under the outside edge. The pie filling will conceal
the inside ends.

**  Fluted  ** Press the tines of a table fork into the edge, keeping
the spacing uniform all the way around the pie crust.

**  Leaves  ** Draft a leaf pattern on cardboard, then cut out the
pattern. Cut the rolled dough around the pattern and score the veins
using the tip of a knife. The finished leaves drape and overlap the
rim.

**  Pinched Edge  ** To create a pinched edge, push the dough with
your thumb against the side of the thumb and forefinger of your other
hand. This will create a high ridge with a subtle zigzag. Continued
