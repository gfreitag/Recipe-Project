Categories: Salsa/sauce, Low cal/fat

1 sl Country-style white bread
-crumbled (abt 1/4 cup)
1 tb Olive oil
1/4 c  Flat-leaf parsley, chopped
2 tb Red wine vinegar
-or to taste
1/2 ts Sugar

Soak the dried chilies in warm water for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350øF. Place the jalape¤o, tomatoes, and garlic
on a piece of lightly oiled foil in a roasting pan. Roast for 30
minutes, or until the garlic is soft. Toast the nuts on a baking
sheet in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until lightly browned. Toast
the bread to a dark golden brown and crumble it into small pieces.

Drain and chop the soaked dried chilies. If a milder sauce is desired,
remove the seeds. Saut the chilies in the oil in a small fry pan for
1-2 minutes, or until crisp and fragrant. Let cool.

Grind the nuts and toast to a fine powder in a food processor. Add the
fried chilies, jalape¤o, garlic, and parsley, and pure to a thick
paste. Add the vinegar, sugar and enough stock to make a pourable
sauce. Correct the seasoning, adding salt and pepper, and vinegar to
taste.

Serve with grilled chicken, baked fish, pork or veal, or even on
pasta.
