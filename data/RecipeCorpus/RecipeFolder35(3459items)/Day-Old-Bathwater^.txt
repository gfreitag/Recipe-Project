About 45 minutes before serving time, set cans of lemon and limeade
and the container of sherbert out to thaw. After 15 minutes, scoop
out half of the sherbert's containers contents and place it into a
brownish color. Place the remaining sherbert back in

Prepare lemon and limeades according to the package directions and
pour into the punch bowl.

Carefully float spoonfuls of the brown blended sherbert on top of the
lemnade mixture, spreading it around to look like dirty brown suds.
Do not stir. Use a ladle to serve punch in cups. Serves about 30
dirty, nonbathing buddies.

Sicko serving suggestion: Float a handful of green, yellow and white
tiny after dinner mints (tiny bars of soap), on top of your scummy
punch.
