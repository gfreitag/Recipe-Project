Cut chicken into 1-1/2 x 1/2 inch strips.  In bowl, blend soy sauce
and hoisin sauces, water, orange juice concentrate, peanut butter,
chili paste and sesame oil until smooth.  Stir in cornstarch.  Add
chicken and stir to coat; marinate for 15 minutes.

Cover mushrooms with warm water; soak for 15 to 50 minutes or until
softened.  Drain and rinse; discard stems and slice caps into thin
strips.

Meanwhile, break noodles into 1-1/2 inch long pieces.  Place in bowl
and cover with water; soak for 5 minutes, then drain.  In saucepan of
boiling water, cook noodles for 5 minutes.  Drain and rinse with cold
water; drain well.

In wok or skillet, heat peanut oil over med-high heat; cook ginger,
garlic and onions for 30 seconds.  Add red pepper and mushrooms; cook
for 3 minutes.  Add chicken with marinade; cook for 3 to 4 minutes or
just until chicken is no longer pink inside.  Stir in noodles and
coriander; let cool.

Dip rice papers, one at a time, into warm water to soften; lay out on
damp tea towels in a single layer.  Place about 2 Tbsp filling in
centre of each triangular sheet (or 1/4 cup in each round sheet).
Fold up bottom over filling; fold sides over and roll up tightly.

(Rolls can be covered with damp tea towel in separate layers and
refrig- erated for up to 8 hours)

In wok or Dutch oven, heat oil over med-high heat to 375F.  Fry
rolls, in batches, for about 5 minutes or until crisp and golden on
all sides. Drain on rack.  Makes 16 large or 30 small rolls.

Instead of deep-frying, steam spring rolls in greased steamer for 5
minutes, or bake for 20 minutes in 400 degree oven.

Assembled spring rolls can also be eaten without being cooked.
