Yield: 40 servings
Melted & divided

1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
5 1/2 c  Flour -- or 6
2 c  Potatoes -- finely shredded
1 c  Shredded cheddar cheese

Each
2 tb Sugar
1/2 c  Warm water
1 c  Milk
5 tb Butter or margarine --
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water;
let stand until foamy, about 5 min. Add milk, 3 tablespoon butter,
salt, cayenne pepper and 2 1/2 cups flour; beat on medium for 2 min.
Stir in potatoes and enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured board; knead until smooth and elastic. (dough
will feel slightly sticky.) Place in a greased bowl, turn once to
grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled,
about 1 hr. Punch the dough down. Pat into a 1/2 inch thick
rectangle. Sprinkle cheese evenly over dough. Fold dough over the
cheese and knead into dough. Shape into two round loaves; place in
greased 9 in. round baking pans. Cover and let rise until doubles,
about 45 min. Cut an x on top of each loaf; brush with remaining
butter. Bake at 400 deg. for 35 to 40 min. or until golden brown.
Remove from pans to cool. Yield: 2 Loaves. (about 40 sliced.)
