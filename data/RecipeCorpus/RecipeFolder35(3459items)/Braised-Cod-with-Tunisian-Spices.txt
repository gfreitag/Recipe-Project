Note: You can also make this dish with snapper, hake, or bluefish.

Run your fingers over the fish, feeling for bones. Remove any you
find with tweezers of needle-nose pliers. Cut fish into 4 pieces.

Combine the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, red pepper flakes, caraway
seeds, and salt in a small, dry skillet. Roast over medium heat for
2-3 minutes, or until the spices are fragrant. Grind the spices in a
spice mill. Rub the fish with the spice mixture and let stand for 10
minutes.

Oil a baking dish just large enough to hold the fish and arrange half
the garlic, onion, and tomato slices over the bottom. Place the fish
pieces in the dish and top  with the remaining garlic, onion, and
tomato slices. Pour the fish stock and lemon juice over the fish.

Can be prepared to this point up to 2 hours ahead

Preheat the oven to 400Ã¸F. Bake the fish for 20-30 minutes, or until
cooked to taste. Sprinkle with parsley and serve at once.
