A luscious treat with a lot of sweet peach flavor. Make this in the
summer when fresh peaches are plentiful. Serve with fresh raspberries.

2 pounds fresh peaches, peeled and pitted 1 tablespoon amaretto or
other almond liqueur 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 3/4 cup (about)
Sugar Syrup

1. Place the peaches in a food processor fitted with the steel blade.
Cover and process for about 30 seconds, until the peaches are pureed
and smooth. Add the amaretto and lemon juice and process for 5
seconds longer. With the machine running, add the sugar syrup slowly.
Taste and add more if necessary. Transfer the peach mixture to a
mixing bowl and refrigerate until the mixture is cold.

2. Pour the peach mixture into your ice cream maker and freeze
according to the manufacturer's directions. When frozen, transfer to
a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid and allow to harden for
several hours in your freezer before serving.
