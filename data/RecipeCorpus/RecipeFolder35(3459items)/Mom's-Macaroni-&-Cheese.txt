(This was one of my favorite dishes as a child.  I don't remember ever
watching my mother measure any of the ingredients for this dish.  But
this is the recipe she sent me after I moved out-of-state and called
home wanting some of her recipes.  Also she always baked this in a
large cast iron skillet.)
