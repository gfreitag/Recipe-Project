Title: Pickled Lemons
Categories: Condiments, Low cal/fat
Yield: 1 pint
1/2 c  (to 1 cup) lemon juice
Extra-virgin olive oil (opt)
3    Lemons
1/2 c  Kosher salt
Scrub the lemons and dry well. Cut each lemon into 8 wedges and each
wedge in half. Remove any seeds. Place the lemons in a bowl with the
salt and mix well. Transfer the lemon mixture to a clean glass jar
with a glass or plastic-coated lid. Add lemon juice to cover.

Seal the jar and let the lemons pickle at room temperature for at
least 5 days, shaking the jar from time to time to mix the juices.
For extra flavor, stir in a tbs or two of olive oil. Store in the
refrigerator.

Great for enlivening seafood, pasta, or grain dished. Pickled lemons
will keep almost indefinitely, and a little goes a long way. A tiny
spoonful of the juice makes a wonderful addition to salad dressing.
