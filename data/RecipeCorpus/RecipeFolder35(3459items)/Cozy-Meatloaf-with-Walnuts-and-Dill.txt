Title: Cozy Meatloaf with Walnuts and Dill
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Nuts/grains
Yield: 8 servings
1/3 c  Dill, snipped
3 tb Fresh parsley, chopped
2 ts Ground cumin
2/3 c  Tomato sauce
1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
1/2 ts Black pepper
4    Strips of bacon
1    Onion, chopped
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 cl Garlic, chopped
1 1/2 lb Ground beef chuck
1/2 lb Ground pork
2 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
2 tb Soda water
1/3 c  Ground walnuts
A combination of beef and pork form the groundwork for this meatloaf,
flavored with the requisite onion, and bound with eggs and ground
walnuts. The walnuts replace the more typical soft bread crumbs and
are a pleasant counterpoint to the seasoning of cumin and snipped
fresh dill.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

In a small skillet, cook the onion in the oil over low heat until
slightly soft, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, raise the heat
to moderate and cook for 45 to 60 seconds.  Remove from the heat and
cool completely.

Lightly but thoroughly mix the onion/garlic mixture together with the
beef, pork, eggs, soda water, walnuts, dill, parsley, cumin, tomato
sauce, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.

Form the meat mixture into a loaf in a lightly oiled 13x9x2-inch
baking pan.  Lay the strips of bacon on top of the loaf lengthwise.
Bake for about 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until the meat is cooked
through and the bacon is golden.  Cut into thick slices for serving
and accompany with your choice of vegetables.

SUGGESTION:Serve the meatloaf with green beans tossed with crumbled
feta cheese and garlic-roasted potatoes.

Makes 8 servings.
