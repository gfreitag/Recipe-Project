Title: Egg Nog Custard Sauce
Categories: Ice cream, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
5 lg Egg yolks
1 ts Rum extract
2 c  Whole milk
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
6 tb Sugar
Rinse a heavy saucepan with cold water; shake dry (this helps prevent
sticking).  Add the milk and 3 tbsp of the sugar and bring the mixture
nearly to a boil over medium heat.  Set aside.  In a bowl, whisk the
egg yolks with the remaining 3 tbsp sugar until blended but not
fluffy. Gradually whisk in about 1/2 of the milk to warm the eggs.
Pour all of the egg mixture into the simmering milk.  Cook, stirring
constantly, until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of a
spoon, usually about 7 minutes; do NOT boil.  Immediately pour the
custard through a fine sieve into a clean bowl.  Stir in hte vanilla
extract and rum extract.  Cool briefly in the refrigerator, stirring
once or twice.  When chilled, cover the bowl until needed.
