Comments: "The history of the above recipe is not really well known
to me, but I do know that it is quite old. It was used on many
occasions, like at church suppers and bazaars.  It was served to the
people for dessert after a hot supper.  Usually a hot sauce was
poured over it. Our grandmother and great grand-mothers served it
numerous times to their families and it certainly was enjoyed by all
and helped keep them healthy and happy."
