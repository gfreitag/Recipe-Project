Title: Swiss Chard
Categories: Holiday, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
Lemon Juice
Vinegar
Swiss Chard
Salt
Ground Black Pepper
I got this recipe from Publix when my husband and I went to Florida
in May.

Swiss Chard is best steamed, as this preserves the delicate flavour.
Wash leaves very throughly to remove all sand or soil. Trim any tough
stems. Cut in large pieces and put in a saucepan with a small amount
of boiling, salted water. Cover and steam for 10 to 12 minutes or
until chard is tender. Don't overcook. Remove from heat, season to
taste with salt and pepper, and add a little lemon juice or vinegar.
