Kalbsbries Imperial:
Soak 3 pairs of sweetbreads in cold water for 1/2 hour.  Cover them
with boiling water; add 1 teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons vinegar, and
simmer for 15 minutes.  Plunge the sweetbreads into cold water and
trim the tubes and membranes.  Press the sweetbreads lightly under a
cloth. Make small incisions and stud the sweetbreads with little
wedges of tongue.  Use about 2 thick slices.
Saute the sweetbreads in 5 tablespoons butter for 10 minutes, or
until they are golden.  Cut them in half lengthwise and fill each
half with 1 tablespoon of goose-liver pate.  Arrange in a shallow
copper pan 3 cups cooked rice mixed with 3 tablespoons butter, 2
tablespoons chopped parsley, and salt to taste, and lay the
sweetbreads on the rice.  Cover with 1-1/2 cups paprika sauce and
sprinkle with 3 tablespoons Parmesan cheese.  Bake the sweetbreads in
a hot oven (400F) for 6 minutes, or until the cheese is browned.
Surround the rice with green peas and decorate the pan with sprigs of
parsley.  Serve from the pan.

Paprika Sauce:
Saute 1 onion, very finely chopped, in 3 tablespoons butter until
it is golden.  Add 2 tablespoons flour sifted with 1 tablespoon
paprika and stir well.  Gradually add 1-1/2 to 2 cups beef stock and
stir the sauce until it is smooth.  Simmer it for 20 minutes, strain
it, add 1/2 cup heavy cream, and bring it back to just under a boil.
