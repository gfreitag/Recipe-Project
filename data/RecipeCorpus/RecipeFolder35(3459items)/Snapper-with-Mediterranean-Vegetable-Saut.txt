but not soft. Correct the seasoning, adding salt, pepper, and cayenne
to taste. The mixture should be very flavorful.

Preheat the oven to 400øF. Cut the snapper into 4 pieces and season

excess. Heat the remaining 1 tbs oil in a non-stick fry pan with a

To serve, transfer the fish, skin side up, to a plate or a platter.
Spoon the vegetable mixture around it and serve at once.
