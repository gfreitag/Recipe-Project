WHIPPED CREAM FILLING:

amount of food coloring to mixture, and beat until soft peaks form.
Yield: 3 cups.

CHOCOLATE FROSTING:
Combine first 3 ingredients in a mixing bowl; beat at medium speed
of an electric mixer until mixture is smooth.  Add egg white, butter,
and vanilla; beat until smooth.  Set bowl in a pan of ice water, and
beat until frosting is thick enough to spread.   Yield: 1-3/4 cups.

NOTE: To make marbled chocolate curls, melt 12 ounces
chocolate-flavored candy coating (squares, wafers, or morsels) in a
double boiler placed over hot water.  Pour onto a smooth surface,
such as marble or an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet.  Then melt 12
ounces vanilla-flavored candy coating.  Stir a small amount of
green-paste food coloring into vanilla coating; pour over chocolate
layer. Using a spatula, swirl the two colors to creat a marbled
effect, covering a 12" x 9" area. Let stand at room temperature until
coating cools and feels slightly tacky but is not firm. (If coating
is too hard, curls will break; if too soft, coating will not curl.)
Pull a cheese plane across coating until curl forms.
