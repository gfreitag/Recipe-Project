Title: Watermelon Cooler
Categories: Fruit, Beverages
Yield: 4 servings
1 pt Lemon Sherbet
1 qt Ginger Ale
2 c  Watermelon Balls
1 c  Blueberries
I got this recipe from Publix in Cocoa Beach, Florida when my husband
and I went there in May 1995. It sounds ideal for the hot weather in
Florida - and for the hot summer we had in England this year :)

Divide the watermelon balls among 4 tall glasses. Add a 1/2 cup scoop
of lemon sherbet to each glass. Fill glasses with ginger ale.
