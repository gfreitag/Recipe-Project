Title: Rock Cafe Old Fashioned Greasy Hamburger
Categories: Main dish, Route 66, Meats, Sandwich
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 ts Pepper
1 ts Onion -- finely chopped
1/4 lb Ground Beef -- coarsely
Ground
1/2 ts Salt -- or to taste
Mix all ingredients, light pat into a burger about 1/2 inch thick. If
you want a juicy burger, don't pack the meat. If the meat is too
lean, mix a little ground suet with the patty. Fry patty on grill or
in an iron skillet for a few mins, turn and cook a few mins longer.
Overcooking dries out the meat. Lightly butter the top and bottom of
a bun, place on grill until golden brown. Spread mustard on bottom
half, pile with chopped onions, pickles, and meat patty. Spread
mayonnaise or mustard on top half of bun. Pat the top of the bun with
a spatula loaded with hamber grease. Provide lettuce, tomato, and
catsup to be used if desired.
