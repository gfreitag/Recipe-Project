MELTING CHOCOLATE
Chocolate scorches easily,
-so always melt it over hot
-- not boiling
- water.  It is best to use
-a double boiler, but you
-can improvise by
Using a cup or bowl in a
-small saucepan over very
-gentle heat.  The
Water must be kept below
this, add 1-2 tbsp of vegetable shortening (never use butter as it
contains moisture which will cause the chocolate stiffen even more!)
to the chocolate and stir vigorously.  You can also melt chocolate
directly over very low heat in a heavy gauge saucepan, but you must
watch the mixture carefully. HOW TO MAKE CHOCOLATE CURLS Use a
vegetable peeler with a long narrow blade and a chunk or bar of
chocolate. Warm chocolate and blade slightly.  Be sure your peeler is
absolutely dry. Draw the peeler along the smooth surface of the
chocolate. HOW TO GRATE CHOCOLATE Be sure that the block of chocolate
is cool and firm.  Grate on hand grater, cleaning the grater often so
that the chocolate doesn't clog the surface of the blade. You can use
a blender, but be sure to cut the chocolate into small pieces first.
HOW TO STORE CHOCOLATE Chocolate should be stored in a cool, dry
place at a temperature of about 60F. If the chocolate becomes too
warm, the cocoa butter rises to the surface and forms a dusty gray
film known as "bloom."  This "bloom" is not harmful and, once the
chocolate is melted, it returns to its natural rich brown color. If
you do store chocolate in the refrigerator or freezer, take in out
and let it stand until it returns to room temperature before you use
it in a recipe. Chocolate is very sensitive to sudden changes of
temperature and you will not get the best results if you do not treat
it with respect. Origin: Farm Journal's Choice Chocolate Recipes
