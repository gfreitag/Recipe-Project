Categories: Soup/stew, Poultry, Vegetables, Meats
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Marjoram
1/2 ts Thyme
1/8 ts Allspice
1/8 ts Sage
1/4 ts Savory
1 c  Warm milk
1/8 ts Pepper
1/8 ts Salt
1    Whole chicken (5-7 lbs.)
1 1/2 c  Smoked ham
1 md Onion, minced
1 lg Clove garlic, minced
4 c  Water
1/2 lg Green bell pepper, chopped

Wash chicken inside and out. Place chicken in a large stock pot. Fill
pot with enough water to cover chicken to a depth of one inch. Cover,
bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until chicken separates from
bones, about 2 hours. With a wide slotted spatula remove chicken to a
plate. Refrigerate until cool enough to handle. Strain broth to
remove any bones and refrigerate. When broth is cool skim fat from
the top. Return 8 cups of broth to pot. Freeze remaining broth for
later use. Yield: 20 cups broth.

Add the spices, ham and 4 cups of water to broth. Cover, bring to a
boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1/2 hour. Meanwhile remove skin and
bones from chicken, and discard. Coarsely chop chicken and peppers.
Mince onion and garlic, add to broth. Simmer for 1/2 hour longer,
stirring occasionally. Remove cover and bring to a boil; add corn and
return to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 1/2 hour, stirring
occasionally. Warm milk and slowly add to chowder, and stir as it is
poured in. Simmer, uncovered 15-20 minutes more.

Note: Freezes well.
