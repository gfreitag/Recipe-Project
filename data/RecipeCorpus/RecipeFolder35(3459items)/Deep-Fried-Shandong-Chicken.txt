Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Wok
Yield: 4 servings
-shredded
2    Cloves garlic -- finely chop
& fry
2 1/2 lb Chicken
2 ts Salt
Oil -- for deep frying
1    Green onion, white part only
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1/2 c  White rice vinegar
1 c  Chicken stock
1 tb Light soy sauce
1/2 ts Salt
1    Red chili peppers --
-deseeded & sliced
4    Cloves garlic -- sliced
1 ts Chili paste
Rub the chicken inside and out with salt and set aside for 30 minutes.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and put in the chicken. Lower
heat to the minimum and simmer the chicken for 30 minutes.  Drain the
chicken, pat dry and hang in an airy place to dry thoroughly.  Just
before the dish is required, heat oil for deep frying in a wok.  To
ensure a crisp texture, make sure the chicken is completely dry.
Lower the whole chicken, breast side down, into the oil and fry for
about 5 minutes until golden brown. Turn and fry the other side for
another 5 minutes.  Remove chicken from oil, drain, chop into
bite-sized pieces and arrange on a serving dish deep enough to
contain 1 1/2 cups sauce.  Tip out all the oil from the wok but do
not wipe.  Add the sauce ingredients and simmer for 2 minutes.  Pour
over the chicken and garnish with the green onion and deep fried
garlic.
