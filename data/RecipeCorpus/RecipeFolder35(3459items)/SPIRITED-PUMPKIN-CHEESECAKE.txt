MMMMM----------------2 TB BUTTER: MELTED & COOLED---------------------
1/8 ts Ground mace
3 lg Eggs; room temp
2 lg Egg yolks; room temp

Pecan Crust:  Heat oven to 350, place rack in center. Coat bottom and
sides of 9" spring form pan evenly with unmelted butter and set
aside. Mix dry ingredients in med. bowl. Drizzle melted butter over
dry mix and stir and toss to coat until slightly darkened and
uniform. Press crust evenly on sides and bottom of pan and
refrigerate 5 minutes. Bake until crust is slightly dry, 8 - 10
minutes, cool on wire rack to room temp. Cheesecake: Cut cream cheese
into 1" chunks, place in large mixer bowl and beat at med speed until
completely smooth. Continue beating while slowly adding brandy. Add
pumpkin and mix well. Continue beating while very slowly adding
sugars, scraping sides of bowl as needed. Beat until smooth, add
spices blend well. Beat whole eggs with the yolks in small bowl at
med speed until blended. Add eggs, about 1/4 c at a time to cheese
mix, beating well and scraping sides of bowl after each addition.
Pour batter into cooled Pecan Crust, spread top smooth. Gently rotate
pan several quarter-turns to settle batter. Bake until sides of cake
are well set and center is just set, about 1 hour and 25 minutes.
Turn oven off. Let cake stand in oven with door propped open 8" for
30 minutes. Place on wire rack away from drafts, let cool undisturbed
until sides and bottom are completely cooled. Remove sides of pan and
refrigerate uncovered overnight or at least 8 hours. Cover loosely
with plastic wrap and refrigerate until serving time. from "The
