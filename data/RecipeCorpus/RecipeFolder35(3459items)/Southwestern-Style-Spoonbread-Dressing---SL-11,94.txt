2 1/4 c  Water
2 lg Eggs
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground red pepper

Prepare cornbread according to package directions; cool and crumble

Cook cumin seeds in a heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring
constantly, 3 minutes or until seeds are more fragrant and lightly
browned.  Cool seeds and crush; set aside.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; add celery and next 3
ingredients, and cook, stirring constantly, until tender.
Stir celery mixture, crushed cumin, stuffing mix, and next 5
ingredients into crumbled cornbread.

Bake at 350F for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until lightly browned.
Garnish, if desired.  Yield: 8 servings.

On a Lighter Side:
To save 51 calories and 8.1 fat grams per serving, prepare
cornbread mix using egg substitute and nonfat buttermilk.  Substitute
2 tablespoons reduced-calorie margarine for the 1/4 cup butter.
Substitute 5 cups plus 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium, ready-to-serve,
fat-free chicken broth for condensed chicken broth and water, and 1/2
cup egg substitute for eggs. Instead of greasing the baking dish,
coat it with vegetable cooking spray. Bake at 350F for 1 hour and 5
minutes.  This version makes a firmer textured dressing than the
original.
