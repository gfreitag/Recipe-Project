Like all oils, it is 100% fat. Sesame oil is, however, one of my only
oil indulgences because it takes so little to flavor a dish. Here is a
TVP-based Bul-Gogi recipe that I threw together after reading a bunch
of beef Bul-Gogi recipes and a couple of TVP ones; it turned out
pretty good. Before anyone balks at the oil and sesame seeds, keep in
mind that his makes a LOT of food. Most Bul-Gogi recipes call for
truly mind-warping amounts of sesame oil and sesame seeds; I've
really cut it nearly to the bone here: Bulgogi-Style TVP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Recipe By: Curtis Jackson Serving Size: 5
Preparation Time :0:20 3 c rice ++ uncooked measure 5 c water 3/4 c
soy sauce ++ or less, to taste 2 tb Sugar ++ or honey 4 ea Cloves
fresh garlic ++ minced 1 ts Black pepper ++ or more to taste 1 tb
Sesame oil ++ so sue me 2 tb Toasted sesame seeds ++ so sue me
(again) 12 ea Spring onions (green onions, scallions) ++ sliced,
incl. tops 12 ea Thai hot chile peppers ++ minced, OPTIONAL 5 tb
Vegetarian beef-flavor bouillon powder* ++ OPTIONAL * if using
flavored TVP, reduce or omit 3 c Beef strip style TVP ++ flavored or
not

Cook the rice separately and serve the sauce over it when done. Start
cooking the rice before you start preparing the sauce and everything
will get ready about the same time. Place all ingredients except TVP
in a 3-quart or larger saucepan that can be covered and mix well.
Bring just to a gentle boil, then add TVP and mix well. Simmer
covered, stirring occasionally to ensure that TVP gets fully
hydrated, until most of the liquid has been absorbed, at least 10
minutes. Serve over the rice. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Serving Ideas : Thai Jasmine or Basmati rices are both excellent.
NOTES : Bulgogi is the name for the Korean beef that is marinated in a
sesame-teriyaki style marinade, then grilled and served wrapped in
lettuce leaves with rice and hot bean paste. This dish attempts to
capture the essential flavors of bulgogi in a "meat" (TVP) sauce
served over rice. Curtis Jackson - cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com
