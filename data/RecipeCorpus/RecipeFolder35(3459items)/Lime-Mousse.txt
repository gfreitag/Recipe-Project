Title: Lime Mousse
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
3/4 c  Lime juice
5    Limes -- zest only, grate
2 c  Heavy cream -- chillled
8 tb Unsalted butter
5    Eggs
1 c  Sugar
Melt butter in the top part of a double boiler over simmering water.
Beat eggs and sugar in a bowl until light and fluffy.  Add mixture to
melted butter.  Cook gently, stirring constantly, until mixture
becomes a custard, about 8 minutes.  Do not overcook or eggs will
scramble.  Remove custard from heat and stir in lime juice and grated
zest.  Cool to room temperature.  Using an electric mixer, whip
chilled cream until very stiff--almost, but not quite, to the point
where it  would become butter. Stir lime custard into whipped cream
until just incorporated.  Pour into 8 individual serving glasses or a
serving bowl.   Chill for at least 4 hours.
