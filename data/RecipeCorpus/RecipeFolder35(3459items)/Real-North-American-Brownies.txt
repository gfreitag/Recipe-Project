These brownies are rich, chewy and very delicious.

Melt butter and chocolate at very low temp and allow to cool.
Beat the eggs until smooth and a little frothy. Add salt, vanilla and
cooled melted chocolate and butter mix. Add sifted cocoa, flour and
pecans. Spread mixture into a greased 9 x 13 inch cake pan and bake
at 350F (180C) for 25 to 30 minutes.

* there is no leavening agent, it's not a mistake
* these brownies are expecially nice if frozen after cutting into
squares.
