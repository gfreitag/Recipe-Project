Title: New Mexico Pumpkin Candy (Trude Duckworth)
Categories: Candies, Vegetables, Holiday
Yield: 3 servings
Sugar, coarse grained *
1 qt Pumpkin cubes
1 c  Brown sugar
Put pumpkin in a pan and cover wtih water.  Bring to a boil and cook
15-20 mins.  Drain, RESERVING LIQUID.  There should be about 1 1/2 c
liquid. Mix liquid with brown sugar, pour over pumpkin, and boil 15
mins. LET PUMPKIN PIECES STAND IN SYRUP OVERNIGHT. Next day boil the
pumpkin in syrup for 5 mins.  Take pumpkin pieces from the syrup and
set on wax paper lined tray in the sun to dry. (If your climate isn't
as dry as the southwest, you might try putting the candy on foil
instead of wax paper nad putting the candy in the oven on warm - the
lowest possible setting - overnight.) After about 10 hrs, roll pieces
in granulated sugar.

* The coarse sugar that is purchased in Mexico is better than U.S.
superfine. Turbinato sugar or raw sugar will give you the effect of
Mexican sugar.
