pick meat off bones when cool. Strain broth. To the broth, add 6 to 8
chicken bouillon cubes, 6 grated carrots, 4 stalks chopped celery, 2
chopped onions, 2 Tbs chopped parsley, 2 leeks, chopped (if used,
omit one onion), and salt and pepper to taste. Boil until tender and
add diced chicken and bring to a boil, Add dumpling dough by small
spoonsful onto hot vegetables, not directly into liquid. Cook
uncovered 10 mins. Cover and cook another 10 mins. Check to see when
dumplings are fluffy.

DUMPLINGS: Mix 1 1/2 cups flour, 2 tsp baking powder, and 3/4 tsp
salt. Then thoroughly cut in 3 Tbs shortening. Next stir in 3/4 cup
of milk. This will be thinner than regular biscuit dough.
