Title: Vanilla Sugar #1
Categories: Herbs/spice, Condiments
Yield: 2 cups
2 c  Granulated sugar
1    Vanilla bean
Slice vanilla bean lengthwise to open, then cut into 1/2-inch pieces.
Place it with sugar in a clean, dry, 1-quart canning jar and screw
the lid on tightly.  Give it a good shake to combine, then set aside.

Every so often, give the jar a shake or open it up and stir it with a
fork to break up the clumps that will form as the moisture from the
bean get drawn into the sugar.  The sugar will be infused with
vanilla flavor in about eight weeks.

To use, sift the sugar into a shaker jar, reserving the vanilla bean
bits. The bean will have lost much of it's potency, but can be used
to flavor another batch of sugar or to make vanilla extract.

Vanilla sugar is used sprinkled on cookies and doughnuts, in tea or
coffee, or wherever else you want! <g>
