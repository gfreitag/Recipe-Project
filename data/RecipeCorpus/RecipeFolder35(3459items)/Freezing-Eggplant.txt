1. Choose plump, firm, evenly and darkly colored eggplant and harvest
before inner seeds mature.

2. Wash, peel, and slice 1/3 inch thick. Work quickly because eggplant
discolors if allowed to stand.

3. Blanch 4 minutes. Add 1/2 cup lemon juice or 4-1/2 teaspoons
citric acid to 1 gallon blanching water. Cool; drain well.

4. Tray freeze or pack into containers. Seal, label, and freeze. to
make slices easier to separate, pack with a piece of freezer wrap
between them.

5. Cook frozen eggplant about 5 to 10 minutes. It's best cooked in a
sauce, or thawed to be coated and fried, or used as an ingredient in
Ratatouille or Moussaka.
