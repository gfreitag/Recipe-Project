Title: Nougat #1 [NY Times]
Categories: Candies, French, Italian, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 3/4 lb
1/2 ts Salt
2    Egg whites, at room temp.
1/2 c  Honey
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 1/2 c  Shelled almonds
1/2 c  Pistachios [opt'l]
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Water
3 tb Light corn syrup
Blanch the almonds and while soft, cut lengthwise into slivers. Brown
lightly in a 350 deg F oven stirring often. Blanch the pistachios by
covering with boiling water for 5 min, draining and slipping off the
skins. Dry by spreading on paper towels.

In a one quart saucepan combine the sugar, water, half the corn syrup
and the salt. Cook together, stirring, until the sugar dissolves.
Cook to 290 deg [a small sample of syrup forms a brittle ball in cold
water- "soft crack stage"]. Remove from the heat.

In a large bowl beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Add the
cooked syrup gradually while beating. Boil together the honey and
remaining corn syrup to 290. Add gradually while beating to the egg
white mixture. Add the almonds [and the pistachios]. Stand the bowl
of candy mixture on a rack in a pan of boiling water and steam,
stirring occasionally until a spoonful of candy, cooled, is not
sticky to the touch about 1 1/2 hr. Add the vanilla.

Line a 11"x7" pan with baker's wafer paper, turn the nougat into the
pan and cover with more paper. Place another pan on top and weigh
down. Let stand overnight. Turn the candy out of the pan and cut into
bars. Wrap in waxed paper and store in a covered tin box in a cool
place.
