This is so good, and not the kind of fruitcake that usually comes to
mind. It contains no candied fruit, so is good for people like me who
abhor the stuff but still want to share in the cakes!

* Put 4 cups flour in a 300 degree oven til tan. Hmm, can't remember
how long this takes... 15 minutes or so? Watch it like a hawk and stir
occasionally.  It will change consistency a bit, kind of lumpy.  But
it smells wonderful.  And if there's any leftover, it makes the BEST
gravy for roast beef..

Cream lard and sugar, beat in molasses.  Mix coffee and soda, stir
into previous mixture.
Combine the raisins and the currants.  Stir in 1 c. of the browned
flour.
Stir in remaining 2 cups of flour and salt into first mixture.  Then
stir in dried fruit/flour mixture.

Grease two bread pans (standard size).  Line with brown grocery
sack/mailing paper, and grease again.  Pour in batter.

Bake in a slow oven, about 275 degrees til baked, about an hour. Cover
with brown paper toward end of baking if it gets too dark on top.

Cool in pan. Keep well wrapped.   ENJOY!!!
