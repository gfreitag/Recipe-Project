A version of the French clafoutis, this rich-tasting dish is easy to
prepare. A cherry-pitting tool makes it that much easier.

1 pound bing (dark red) cherries, stems removed and pitted 5
tablespoons granulated sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 cup
all-purpose four Pinch of salt 2 cups whole milk, light cream, or
half-and-half 3 large eggs, lightly beaten Confectioners' sugar for
garnish

1. Preheat the oven to 375-F. Generously butter a shallow 10-inch
glass or ceramic baking dish (such as a pie plate or tart pan).

2. Arrange the cherries in a single layer in the bottom of the baking
dish. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the sugar and the cinnamon over the
cherries.

3. Put the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl. Using a wire
whisk or hand mixer, slowly add the milk and beat to combine with the
flour. Add the eggs and beat vigorously for 2 to 3 minutes, until the
mixture is light and foamy. Beat in the remaining sugar. Pour the
egg-and-milk mixture over the cherries. Place on the middle shelf in
the oven and bake 35 to 45 minutes, or until lightly brown and puffy.
Allow to cool slightly. Sprinkle heavily with confectioners' sugar
and serve warm.
