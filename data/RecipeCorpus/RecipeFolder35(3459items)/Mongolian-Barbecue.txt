Thinly slice the meats across the grain, in 2 to 3-Inch strips, and
arrange the meat and vegetables on separate platters.

SAUCE: Simmer the soy sauce, water, peppercorns, anise and garlic for
a few minutes in a saucepan, then strain and cool.  Add the wine,
sugar, ginger root, 2 cups of the scallions or leeks and 2 cups of
the Chinese Parsley. Refresh the sauce with the remaining scallions
or leeks and parsley as cooking progresses.  Taste to correct the
seasoning, then divide among the guests bowls.  (NOTE:  Do Not taste
the sauce after the raw meat has been dipped in it! Just a
precaution.)

TO ASSEMBLE:

To assemble the barbecue, place the cooking appliance in the center
of the table, heating and greasing the cooking surface with the salad
or peanut oil.  (At intervals, scrape off the charred food bits with
a spatula and re oil the cooking surface and resume cooking).  Guests
put the meat and vegetables on the plates and then place small
portions on the cooking surface and spoon some of the sauce over the
grilling food, flipping the food over with chopsticks after about 1
minute on the grill. Cook to the desired doneness of each guest.
