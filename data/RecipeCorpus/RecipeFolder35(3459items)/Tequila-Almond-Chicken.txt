4. Remove the garlic slices from the chicken marinade. Pat the almond
mixture on both sides of each breast half to coat thoroughly.

5. In a large non-stick skillet, melt 1 tbs of the butter in « tbs of
the olive oil over high heat. Add 2 of the chicken breast halves,
reduce the heat to moderate and cook until golden brown on the

chicken to plates and wipe out the skillet. Repeat with the remaining
butter, oil and chicken. Season the tomato-avocado salad with salt
