Title: Pears Poached in Peppered Port
Categories: Fruit, Low cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
1    Cinnamon stick
5    Cloves
1 ts Cornstarch
8    Sprigs mint for garnish
4    Pears
1    Lemon
3 c  Port wine
1/4 c  Sugar or to taste
20    Black peppercorns
Peel the pears, cut in half lengthwise, and core with a melon baller.
Remove 3 strips zest from the lemon with a vegetable peeler. Cut the
lemon in half and rub the peats with one half to prevent browning.
Juice the other half.

Combine the lemon zest and juice, port, sugar, and spices in a deep,
wide saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, add the pears,
cut side up, and cover the pan. Poach the pears for 3-12 minutes
depending on their ripeness, or until very tender. They should be
easy to pierce with a toothpick. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the
pears, cut side down, to a wire rack to cool.

Boil the poaching liquid until only 1Â« cups remain. Dissolve the
cornstarch in 1 tbs cold water. Whisk into the sauce and boil for 30
seconds. Strain the sauce and chill.

Arrange the pears, cut side down, on a cutting board. Using a sharp
knife, starting at the wide end of each pear, make a series of
lengthwise parallel cuts almost to the stem end. Do not cut all the
way through; the slices should be attached at the end. Gently flatten
each pear with the palm of your hand to fan out the slices. Spoon the
sauce on a platter or on individual plates. Using a spatula, arrange
the fanned-out pears on top. Garnish with mint sprigs and serve at
once.
