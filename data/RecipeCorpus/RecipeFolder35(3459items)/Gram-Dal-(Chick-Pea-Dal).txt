Title: Gram Dal (Chick Pea Dal)
Categories: Main dish, Indian, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1 ea Bay leaf
2 1/2 tb Coconut, fresh, chopped
2 1/2 tb Raisins
1 1/4 c  Green peas
1/4 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Garam masala
1 c  Chick peas
2 1/2 c  Water
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Turmeric
1/4 c  Ghee
1 pn Cumin seeds
1 pn Asafetida
1 1/4 ts Ginger, grated
Soak chick peas for at least 2 hours.  Drain & rinse.  Bring to a
boil in the water & add the salt & turmeric.  Boil hard for 5 minutes
& remove any scum that forms on the surface.  Reduce heat & simmer
until tender. This will take about 1 hour, but it can take longer if
your peas are old. When tender, remove from the heat.

Heat ghee in a large pot.  Add cumin seeds, asafetida, ginger & bay
leaf. Fry for a few seconds, stirring as the spices cook.  Add the
coconut, raisins & peas.  Cook over a medium heat for 3 minutes,
stirring occasionally.  Stir in the cooked chick peas, followed by
the rest of the ingredients.  Simmer for another 15 minutes & serve.
