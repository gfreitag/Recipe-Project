In a wide heavy skillet, heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil over medium
heat. Add the sausages and brown well on all sides, turning
occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, in a separate deep skillet
heat the remaining 3 tbsp of oil over medium heat.  Add the onions,
peppers and garlic, tossing to coat with oil.  Cook, tossing
occasionally, until the vegetables are slightly wilted, 6 to 8
munutes. Stir in the vinegar, tomatoes, salt and oregano.  Tuck the
browned sausages into the pepper mixture.  Cook, covered, over medium
heat for 15 minutes.  Uncover the pan and cook, stirring occasionally
until the vegetables are cooked through and the vegetable mixture has
thickened slightly, about 15 minutes longer.  Stir in the basil,
pepper and salt.  Add a few drops more vinegar, if needed to give it
a pleasant tang.  Serve hot with plenty of good italian bread.
