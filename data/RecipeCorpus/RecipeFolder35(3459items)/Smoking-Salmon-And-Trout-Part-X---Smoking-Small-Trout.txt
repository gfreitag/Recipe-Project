Yield: 1 text file  Unboned: Make an 80 deg sal brine with 8.5 oz salt per quart water,
score skin and brine 1 hr. Spit them through the eyes with a heavy
wire [a welding rod works well here]and hold the belly open with
small match stick sized sticks. Dry at 90 deg F for 30 min [forced
draft] or 1 hr or more [natural draft]. Then smoke at 160 deg F for 1
1/2 hrs [forced] or 3 hrs or more [natural].

Depending on the shape desired and the boning method used, spit
through the eyes and prop open with match stick sized wood, or hang
over a dowel, or rolled and skewered. Drying and smoking temps and
times are the same as for unboned.
