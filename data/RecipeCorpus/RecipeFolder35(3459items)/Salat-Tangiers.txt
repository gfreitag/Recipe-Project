Title: Salat Tangiers
Categories: Salads, African
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Green beans
1/3 c  Red onion
1/3 c  Currants
1/2 c  Almonds
1 1/2 c  Couscous
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/4 c  Boiling water
1 c  Carrots
1    Bell pepper
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
3 tb Orange juice
4 tb Fresh parsley
1 tb Fresh spearmint
1/2 c  Oil
4 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Cinnamon
Dice the bell pepper and carrots, cut the green beans, chop the red
onion and almonds. Put couscous and salt in large bowl; stir in
boiling water. Cover and let sit for 5-10 minutes, stirring
occasionally to fluff. Steam carrots, bell pepper and beans
separately (instructions say this but I steam them all together). As
soon as each vegetable is barely tender, add to couscous. Stir in red
onions, currants and almonds. Whisk together marinade ingredients.
Toss couscous and vegetable mixture with marinade, chill for at least
one hour before serving. Submitted By KAZ LANGRIDGE   On   09-24-95
