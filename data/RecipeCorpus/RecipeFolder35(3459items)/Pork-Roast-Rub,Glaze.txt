Title: Pork Roast Rub/Glaze
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Allspice
1/4 ts Ground anise
2/3 c  Maply syrup
2 tb Olive oil
1 ts Mace
1/2 ts Cardamom
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ginger
Mix all the dry ingredients together on a plate, stirring until
combined.  In small bowl, combine the maply syrup and the oil.  Set
aside.  Take thawed roast and dab into the spices, coating all sides.
If any dry mixture remains, rub into roast making sure it is
completely coated.  Place roast in roasting pan, and using pastry
brush, gently use the glaze to coat over top of the spices.  Roast in
a 325-350F oven until done, basting with more glaze occasionally
during roasting process.
This turns out very nice, and apple sauce makes a great accompaniement
to this as the spices in the glaze compliment the apple sauce.
