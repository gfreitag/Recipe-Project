Title: Sugar-Free Breakfast Fruit Muffins
Categories: Breakfast, Muffins, Low cal/fat
Yield: 16 muffins
MMMMM----------------COLUMBUS DISPATCH; 3/24/1993---------------------
1/4 c  All Bran cereal
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
1 ts Cinnamon, ground
2 lg Bananas, very ripe
6 oz Frozen orange juice juice
-concentrate, thawed
2    Eggs
2 c  Flour
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Beat bananas, orange juice concentrate and
eggs together until well blended. Stir remaining dry ingredients
together and add to the banana mixture.  Beat just until blended.

Spoon into non-stick muffin cups that have been sprayed with cooking
spray; fill muffin cups half full.  Bake 14-18 minutes.

Sylvia's comments: Instead of using non-stick cooking spray, I lined
the muffin cups with paper liners like I usually do.  Big mistake --
more muffin stuck to the liner than got eaten!  The kids loved them,
and I'll just remember to use cooking spray next time.
