*Kim chee and Grits recipes to be supplied if required.

Have a shot of your preferred inspiration. Chop one large beet root
into 1/4" dice and simmer in a half cup water until softened. Set
aside. Have another shot. Prepare a small batch of grits and have
ready well aged kim chee. Set aside. In a blender or food processor
process the beets and cooking liquor until smooth; add tofu and
process further. Add salt and pepper to taste. Optionally add a
little MSG to fully develop this truly intriguing blend of flavors.

Combine the grits and kim chee. Stuff squid with the grit dressing
and marinade in the beet-tofu vinaigrette for 2 hours. Have a few
more shots while waiting. Transfer the squid to a well oiled
casserole and pour over the vinaigrette; cover and bake in a 350
oven until tender. If you are thirsty, have another drink while the
squid is cooking.

Serve with rice and the balance of the liquor on the side.

Note: There are no substitutes for the tequila/bourbon; this dish
does not taste right if sober!
