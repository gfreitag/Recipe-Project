The Italian Way; Judith
This recipe dates from the Renaissance. Although it is traditionally
prepared with the precious, specially aged balsamic vinegar, your
standard supermarket variety balsamic vinegar can do justice to the
berries. This is the best way to treat berries that look beautiful
but lack taste. The vinegar somehow finds the flavor hiding within
the fruit and brings it out.

2 quarts fresh strawberries, stems removed and cut in half lengthwise
1/4 cup confectioner's sugar 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Place the strawberries in a large serving bowl. Sprinkle the sugar
over the berries and pour the vinegar over the top. Toss well and
chill for at least an hour. Toss well again before serving.
