Title: San Fernando Valley Beans
Categories: Side dish, Sausage, Vegetables
Yield: 10 servings
2    Cloves garlic -- peeled
1 1/2 c  Tomato juice
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Chili powder
Sour cream -- optional
1 lb Dried kidney beans
1/2 lb Bulk sausage
1/2 c  Brown sugar
2 lg Apples -- cored & thin
Sliced
4 md Onion -- sliced
Rinse and sort through beans, discarding any debris.  Soak beans
overnight in enough water to cover by about 2".  Drain beans, return
to pan and add water to cover by 2".  Bring to a boil; then reduce
heat, cover and simmer until beans are very tender to bite, about 1
1/2 hours.  Drain and set aside.  Crumble sausage into large pan.
Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until lightly browned.
Discard fat from pan; then add sugar, apples, onions, garlic, tomato
juice, salt, pepper and chili powder.  Stir until blended.  Bring to
a boil ove high heat and add cooked beans.  Then reduce heat and
simmer, uncovered until liquid has evaporated, at least 2 hours.  If
desired, top each serving with a dollop of sour cream.  (Note these
changes:  I used bulk turkey sausage.  Also when I added all the
ingredients it seemed pretty dry so I also added 1 1/2 cups water
before the final 2 hours of cooking. It worked very well.)
