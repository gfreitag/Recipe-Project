Categories: Pasta/rice, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Penne
1/2 c  Olive oil
14 oz Tuna in water
2 tb Black olive paste
1 ts Red pepper flakes
Black pepper
Salt
1 lg Onion
4 md Carrots
1/4 c  Sun-dried tomatoes,
Oil-packed
1 c  Parsley -- tightly packed
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.  Thinly
slice the onion.  peel and slice the carrots 1/4" thick.  Finely
julienne the sun-dried tomatoes.  Rinse and mince the parsley.  Add
the pasta to the boiling water before cooking the sauce.  Heat the
olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion and
carrots and saute until somewhat softened, 5 minutes.  Add the
sun-dried tomatoes, lower the heat, cover and simmer until the
carrots and onions are completely tender, 7 to 10 minutes more.  Add
the tuna to the skillet along with the black olive paste and pepper
flakes; saute a few minutes longer just to heat the tuna through.
Remove the skillet from the heat.  When the pasta is tender but still
firm to the bite, drain it well.  Stir the parsley into the sauce and
season to taste with salt and pepper.  To serve, dish some pasta into
each bowl and ladle the sauce over top.
