Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Flour
1/4 ts Salt
pn Cinnamon
OAT CRUNCH TOPPING
1/2 c  Oatmeal
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
1/2 c  Unsalted butter -- cut into
-pieces
CUSTARD SAUCE
2 c  Milk
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
5    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Sugar
PEAR FILLING
9 c  Pears (about 3 1/2 lb) --
-peeled & sliced
3/4 c  Sugar
Bring the milk nearly to a boil in a heavy saucepan.  Meanwhile whisk
the yolks and sugar in a mixing bowl until blended.  Gradually whisk
the scalded milk into the egg yolk mixture; return to the pan.  Stir
constantly with a wooden spoon over medium heat until thickened
enough to coat the back of a spoon evenly, about 7 minutes.  Do not
boil.  Pour into a bowl and stir in the vanilla.  Cool thoroughly,
stirring occasionally; then chill, covered.  Preheat the oven to 375.
In a mixing bowl toss the pears with the lemon juice.  In a small
bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, salt and cinnamon until
blended.  Add this mixture to the pears; toss to combine and transfer
the mixture to a well-buttered 8" square pan. In mixing bowl or food
processor cut together the oatmeal, flour, brown sugar and butter
until crumbled to the size of large peas.  Scatter the topping
mixture over the pear slices.  Bake until the topping is nicely
golden, 35 to 40 minutes.  Cool briefly on a wire rack; then serve
warm, passing the cold custard sauce separately.
