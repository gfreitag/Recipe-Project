Categories: Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Plus 1 tsp cornstarch
2 c  To 3 cups muscadines
3 c  Water
4 md Firm, ripe pears
Rinse muscadines; combine muscadines and water in a medium saucepan.
Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer 45 minutes.  Remove
from heat; mash muscadines with a potato masher.  Strain through a
jelly bag, reserving 1-1/4 cups juice; set aside.
Peel pears, leaving stems intact.  Cut a thin slice from bottoms,
so that pears can stand upright.  Place pears in a steamer in an
upright position; cover and simmer 15 to 20 minutes or until pears
are tender.
Combine sugar and cornstarch in a small saucepan; gradually add
reserved muscadine juice, stirring well.  Bring mixture to a boil,
and cook 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.
Place pears in individual compotes; pour sauce over pears.
