Cut four 12-inch sheets of parchment paper and lightly butter a 5-inch

arrange equal portions of the white fish, tuna, scallops and shrimp;
set aside.

In a 2-cup glass measure, place the mushrooms, asparagus, carrot,
shallot and wine. Cover with vented plastic wrap and microwave on
HIGH until the asparagus is crisp-tender, 2-3 minutes.

Using a slotted spoon, remove the vegetables and spoon them over the
seafood. Add the mustard, marjoram, salt and pepper to the cooking
juices left in the glass measure; stir to mix. Spoon the wine mixture
over the seafood.

Bring all four sides of parchment together and tie like a beggar's
bag with colored yarn, paper curling ribbons, a strip of plastic wrap
or string. Place the bags on a microwaveable plate. Microwave on HIGH
4-5 minutes, turning each bag halfway after 2 minutes. Let stand 3
minutes before placing on serving plates for diners to open at the
table.
