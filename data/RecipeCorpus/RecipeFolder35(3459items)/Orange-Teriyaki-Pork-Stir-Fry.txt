Categories: Meats, Fruit, Wok, Dips/spread
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Gingerroot
1 tb Vegetable oil
12 oz Fast fry boneless pork
-cutlets, thinly sliced
1    Bag (750gram) frozen stir
-fry vegetables
1 1/2 ts Grated orange rind

When you use frozen prepared stir fry vegetables, the only cutting
required is slicing the pork and mincing the garlic.  Serve over hot
cooked rice.

Whisk together the orange rind and orange juice, teriyaki sauce,
mustard, cornstarch, garlic and ginger.  Set aside.  In wok, or large
high sided skillet, heat the vegetable oil.  Stir fry the sliced pork
until no longer pink and set aside on a plate.  Add the vegetables,
stirring over high heat until most of the water evaporates and the
veggies become glossy. Set aside in bowl. Pour the orange juice
mixture into the wok, and stir until thick and shiny.  Add the
vegetables and meat, and stir until coated with sauce.  Makes 4
servings.
