Title: Veggie Pie
Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian, Meats
Yield: 1 servings
Crust pie -- unbaked
Pastry for a 10" single
MMMMM------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
1/2 md Sized Turnip or a whole
-small one
2 md Potatoes
3    Or 4 Parsnips
3    Or 4 Carrots
MMMMM-------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
Freshly ground black pepper
Topping-----
1 c  Fresh bread crumbs
1    Or 2 tsp Dried basil
Margarine or oil -- for
Toasting
1/4 c  Olive oil -- or any cooking
Oil
1/4 c  Flour
2 c  Vegetable stock
1 ts Marmite
1    Or 2 tsp Soya sauce
1 ts Dried basil
Cut up and boil potatoes, parsnips, carrots and turnip until cooked
but not soft.

Note:  I just use a mixture of whatever veggies I have on hand and
cook enough to fill the 10" pie plate - I like it quite full, heaped
up really.

Mix the cooked vegetables with the mixed sauce ingredients and pour
into the unbaked pie shell.

Heat the oil or margarine in a frying pan over medium heat and toast
the crumbs and basil until crispy and light brown.  Watch closely to
make sure they don't burn.

Sprinkle over the veggie mixture in the pie plate and bake at 425
until the pastry is cooked and the mixture is bubbling.  The topping
may get quite dark but this is O.K.
