4.) Before placing liver under fire, smear with oil, crushed
garlic and a little Burgundy wine.

5.) Dip slices of liver in beaten egg and seasoned bread crumbs
before frying with onions.

6.) Cover liver with milk and let stand for 20 minutes before

as the most expensive cuts.

7.) Put calves-liver slices in sizzling skillet and turn them
