Title: Beurre Maitre D'Hotel #2
Categories: French, Meats
Yield: 1 /2 cup
1 tb Freshly chopped chives
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/4 lb Sweet butter
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Freshly minced parsley
Cream the butter and mix the remaining ingredients, adding the lemon
juice a little at a time. Turn onto waxed paper, form into a roll and
refrigerate til hardened. Slice off portions to garnish steaks and

Variations using different fresh herbs (minced shallots or garlic,
mustard, horseradish, and so forth) are also wonderful.
