Title: Jeff's Casserole
Categories: Meats, Casseroles
Yield: 1 servings
Cheese (or favorite brand)
1    Tomato, chopped
1    Green onion, chopped
1 lb Hamburger
1/2 sm Onion, chopped
1 cn Cream of mushroom soup
1    Box Kraft Macaroni and
Brown hamburger and onion together with a pinch of salt and pepper.

Prepare Mac and cheese as per box instructions.

In a casserole dish (these measurements fit in a bread pan - just
barely) layer 1/2 the hamburger mixture, 1/2 of the soup, and 1/2 of
the mac & cheese, repeat layers with remaining halves.  Sprinkle the
top with the chopped tomato and onion.  Cover with foil to keep
everything from drying out.  Bake at 350 for 30 min. and serve.

Note:  this reheats very well, but shouldn't be stored too long.

This actually looks like the college version of many other hamburger
casserole recipes, but I happen to think this one can stand all on
