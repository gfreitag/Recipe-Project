Title: Smoking Salmon And Trout Part XVI - Caviar
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Can/preserv, Information
Yield: 1 text file  Salmon caviar is second only to sturgeon in quality.

To make red caviar you need a piece of 1/4" to 1/2" mesh screen at
least one foot square,depending on the egg size. first choice is
plastic or stainless steel but plain steel can be coated with
vegetable oil and galvanized can be coated with resin. Separate the
eggs from the membrane by gently rubbing the skein of eggs over the
screen. Discard the membrane and blood vessels remaining on the
screen after most of the eggs have passed through.

Make an 80 deg sal brine [ 1 cup + 2tbs salt to 1 qt water]. Gently
stir the eggs in the cooled brine from 15 to 30 min. The uptake of
salt will depend on the maturity of the eggs; they should become
opalescent. Do not over salt. drain for 8 hours. Keep cool but above
40 deg so the eggs do not congeal. Pack into jars. Refrigerate
between 34 and 36 deg. up to a year. Over 40 deg it will have a very
short life.

N.B. Once sealed in jars it MUST be kept refrigerated at all times to
prevent possible BOTULISM. some caviars can be pasteurized with
minimal loss of flavor and color but not salmon. Rely on good
refrigeration instead.
