Organization Tips *****************
Here are a few other suggestions that will help you better
:
organize yourself for all of your cooking and baking.

Know the specific requirements of the item or items you are to
prepare. Are there special ingredients needed? Is the butter
.
:
to be
cold, room temperature or melted? Are the nuts blanched,
:
sliced,
slivered or chopped? Should the oven be preheated? To what
temperature? Is extra time required for chilling or heating
:
:
the
ingredients? Is it necessary to wait before serving?
:

Pay close attention to what you are doing while you work,
.
giving
special consideration to every detail, especially with new
:
recipes
or unfamiliar techniques. Allow yourself plenty of time to
:
finish
a recipe, including the final decoration.
:

Always begin by preparing the baking pans, adjusting the oven
shelves, and preheating the oven to the required temperature.
.
:
Then
when the mixture is ready for the oven there will be no delay
before baking. This is especially important with cakes, which
:
:
may
deflate and lose their lightness, with pie crusts, which may
collapse, and with puff pastry, which will not rise if the
:
:
oven
temperature is not hot enough.
:

Avoid opening the oven door during the early baking stage.
.
Other
than with small cookies, which you can peek at after 5
:
minutes,
generally you should wait at least 15 to 20 minutes, or until
approximately half the baking time has elapsed before opening
:
:
the
door.
:

Don't work against yourself by being a pot-saver in order to
.
save
clean-up time. Use all of the pots, pans, bowls, spoons,
:
spatulas,
equipment and towels that you need to get the job done. But
cleanup after yourself frequently to avoid confusion.
:
:

And, most of all, enjoy yourself. Put your heart into everything you
make, infuse it with love, and you will be transformed in the
process, as will be everyone who works by your side or eats the food
you prepare. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   10-11-95
