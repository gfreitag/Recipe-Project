I first tasted this salad in a hotel restaurant in Sirmione, a
medieval walled city on Lake Garda in northern Italy. I have no idea
what variety of mushrooms they served, but I have made this salad
many times and have used most of the "wild" varieties available in my
grocery store, as well as plain white mushrooms, all with wonderful
results. Use the freshest, best-quality mushrooms, since the taste of
the mushrooms really comes through.

1 pound fresh mushrooms (crimini, portobello, shiitake, or white
cultivated, or a mixture of two or more varieties), stems removed,
caps thinly sliced 1/4 pound Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, shaved paper
thin 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons fresh lemon Juice
Freshly ground black pepper to taste Salt

1. Place the mushrooms and cheese in a medium-size serving bowl.

2. Combine the oil, lemon juice, and a few grinds of the black pepper
in a small mixing bowl. Pour over the mushroom-and-cheese mixture and
toss gently but thoroughly to distribute the dressing. Add more oil, a
tablespoon at a time, if the mixture seems too dry. Season lightly
with salt. Be careful not to oversalt since the cheese will also add
saltiness. Serve immediately.
