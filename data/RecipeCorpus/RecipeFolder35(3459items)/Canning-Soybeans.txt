Categories: Can/preserv, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings

You must really rush soybeans from the field to the jar, they start
to lose flavor almost as soon as they're picked. Soybeans have to be
briefly boiled before processing. All the basic equipment is used.

1. Choose only young, tender beans.

2. Organize and prepare equipment and work area.

3. Wash, drain, and shell beans. Wash again.

4. Cook beans in just enough boiling water to cover for 3 minutes.
Pack beans into hot jars to within 1 inch of tops. Add 1/2 teaspoon
salt to pints, 1 teaspoon to quarts, if desired. Pour in boiling
water to within 1 inch of tops of jars.

5. Run a slim, non metal tool down along the inside of each jar to
release air bubbles. Add more boiling liquid to fill to within 1 inch
of tops.

6. Wipe tops and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth.

7. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

8. Process at 10 pounds pressure, 55 minutes for pints, 1 hour and 5
minutes for quarts. Follow manufacturer's directions for your canner.

9. Follow basic steps for steam pressure canning, 10 through 24.
