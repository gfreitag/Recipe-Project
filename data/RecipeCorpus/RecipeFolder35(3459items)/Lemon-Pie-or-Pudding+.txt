Has anyone (like myself) ever looked for a recipe for simple lemon
pudding? I found it a difficult task. I found this from which I can
lift a recipe for that stuff which I seek. I might even try the pie
sometime as it looks like good eatin' too.

Recipe from; 10,000 Tastes of Minnesota from the Womens's Club of
Minneapolis.
