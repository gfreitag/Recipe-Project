The Turkey:
Preheat the oven to 350F, then turn up to 500F.  Arrange the
anchos on a baking sheet and heat in the oven until softened, about 2
minutes. Cut open the anchos, discard the stems, seeds, and veins,
rinse the anchos and place in a small bowl.  Cover with boiling
water, and let soak for 30 minutes. In a food processor, combine the
anchos with some of the soaking liquid, the garlic, onion, lime
juice, oil, and salt. Process until smooth, about 2 minutes.  The
ancho puree can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated in a
covered container.
Score the turkey skin at 1" intervals and rub the ancho puree over
the turkey breast.  Let marinate at room temperature for about 1
hour. Cook the turkey breast in a preheated 400F oven for about 30 to
40 minutes. The internal temperature should register 180F.  Slice and
serve with the salsa.

Corn and Tomato Salsa:
Cook the corn in salted water to cover until tender, about 2 to 4
minutes.  Drain and rinse under cold water, then scrape the kernels
from the cob.  In a medium-size bowl, stir together the corn and
remaining ingredients until well blended.  Cover and refrigerate
until ready to serve.
