Title: Roast Turkey With Kahlua Glaze
Categories: Holiday, Poultry, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
See below
The basic plot is you rub the turkey with unsalted shortening, and
then cover it with cheesecloth soaked in melted, unsalted butter.
(Rombauer says to put it on a rack, but I don't.)  Then put it in an
oven that was preheated to 450 degrees, but reduce the heat to 350.
Then you supposedly baste every 10 minutes or so.  (Not!)

I use a glaze -- which I also use to baste -- of 1 part Kahlua to
1 part apricot preserves.  Sounds weird, but I always get rave
reviews. Yes, I baste it right over the top of the cheesecloth.
Actually permeates the meat.  Then I peel the cloth off before
presentation (bird is a dark, rich brown) and serve w/ sauce.

BTW, the only time I used pop-up indicators is when I was given
turkeys that had them.  I ignored the indicator --> used standard
cooking chart for weight (should be on turkey).  You know how the
turkey keeps cooking even when it's not in the oven?  Sure enough,
after he had been out of oven long enough to serve, the indicator
FINALLY popped up!
