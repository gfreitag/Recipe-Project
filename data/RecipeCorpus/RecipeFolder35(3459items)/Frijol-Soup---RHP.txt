Place the beans in a large, deep, heavy stockpot ot Dutch oven;
cover with water, and allow to sit overnight.  Drain.  Add the 2
quarts of water, onion, tomato, chillies, and salt.  Cover and bring
to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer,
covered, until the beans are very soft, 4 to 5 hours.  Be careful not
to let the beans cook dry and burn.  Add boiling water as needed,
never cold water or the beans won't be tender.  You can cook a ham
bone with the beans if you like, but true Mexican beans seldom have
added meat.
Once the beans are cooked, add the garlic and cilantro, then puree
the soup in a blender in batches, adding water until the desired
consistency is reached.  This soup may be served thick and eaten as
the main dish or thinner if served before the meal.  Pour the soup
into warmed bowls and add a dollop of sour cream and a sprig of fresh
cilantro to each. Serve immediately, with toasted tortilla chips.
