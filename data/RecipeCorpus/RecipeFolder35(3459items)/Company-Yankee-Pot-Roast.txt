kettle under the meat, add water and onion and bay leaves. Simmer

Add remaining ingredients EXCEPT for the mushrooms and peas.  Simmer
for an additional 30 minutes or until vegetables are done.

Remove meat and bay leave - thicken liquid with a flour and water
paste. Add the peas and mushrooms just to warm through.
