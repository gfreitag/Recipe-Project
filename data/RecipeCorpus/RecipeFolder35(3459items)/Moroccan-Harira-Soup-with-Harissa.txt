Starter: Prepare 2-3 days in advance. Mix the flour and water
together in a small non-metallic bowl, cover lightly with waxed paper
and allow to ferment at room temperature in a warm place for 2-3
days. Stir it each morning with a wooden spoon.

Soup: Heat oil over medium heat in a heavy 7-qt. pot. Sear the lamb
shank in the oil, add the chopped onions, celery and carrots. Add the
pepper, cinnamon, allspice and saffron and saut, stirring
occasionally, over medium-low heat, until the vegetables are wilted.
Add the chicken wings and water, raise the heat to medium and bring
to a boil. Skim foam from surface and add the barley, rice and red
lentils. Cover, lower heat to simmer and cook for 50 minutes.

Lift out chicken wings and lamb shank and let meats cool enough to
handle. Pure the tomatoes and tomato paste in the bowl of a food
processor and add to the simmering soup. Then, in the same unwashed
food processor, process the parsley, cilantro, and ¬ cup of water and
add to the soup. Stir in the salt and the cooked chick-peas and
simmer for 10 minutes more. Meanwhile, remove the meat from the
chicken wings and add to the soup. Then cut the lamb from the bone
into bite-size pieces and add them to the soup as well. Add 2 tbs of
the sourdough starter to the hot soup and stir occasionally to
thicken the soup and to heat the meats.

Serve in large bowls with a wedge of lemon to be squeezed into the
soup at the table and Harissa paste, if desired.

Harissa Paste: Drain the chile peppers, discarding the water, and add
all the ingredients except the olive oil to a small spice mill and
pure. Put the pure in a jar and float some olive oil on  the
surface. Refrigerate; it will keep well for 2-3 weeks. Use sparingly.
