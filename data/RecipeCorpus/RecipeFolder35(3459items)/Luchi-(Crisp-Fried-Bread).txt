Title: Luchi (Crisp Fried Bread)
Categories: Indian, Breads
Yield: 20 luchis
2 tb Water
Oil for deep-fat frying
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 pn Salt
2 tb Ghee
Sift together the flour & salt.  Mix in the ghee & add then add just
enough water to make a stiff dough.  Knead very well for 10 to 15
minutes. Divide the dough into 20 balls, cover & set aside for 20
minutes.

Roll out each ball on an unfloured board into small, flat, thin
circles. If the dough is stiff, try lightly greasing the rolling pin.
Roll each luchi as thinly as possible.  If you make puri, roll them
out thinner than you would when making puri.

Heat 2 or 3 inches of oil in a skillet or wok until it is very hot.
Drop the luchi into the hot oil & press down lightly with the back of
a spoon. They will puff up exactly like puri.  Drain & serve
immediately.
