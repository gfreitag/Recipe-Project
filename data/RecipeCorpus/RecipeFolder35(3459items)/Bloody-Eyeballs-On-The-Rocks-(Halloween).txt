Title: Bloody Eyeballs On The Rocks (Halloween)
Categories: Beverages, Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
12    Pimiento-stuffed olives
46 oz Cold ginger-ale -- divided
12    Red radishes, washed, ends
-removed
Prepare these bloody balls the day before you plan to serve them.
Using a stiff vegetable brush, scrub part of the red skin off the
radish, leaving enough to look like a bloody eyeball.
Using the tip of the vegetable peeler or a small knife, carefully
scoop out a small hole in each radish. Stuff a green olive, pimiento
side out, in each hole. Place 1 radish eyeball in each section of an
empty ice cube tray (You may need to pare your eyeballs down a bit to
fit). Fill the tray with water and freeze overnight.
Evenly divide ginger ale into six glasses. Place 2 eyeball ice cubes
in each one.
