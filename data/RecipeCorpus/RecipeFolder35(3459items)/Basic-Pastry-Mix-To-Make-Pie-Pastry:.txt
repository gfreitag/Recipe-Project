Place the pastry mix in a medium bowl. With a fork, gently mix in just
enough water to moisten dry ingredients. Form into a ball. For ease of
handling, wrap and chill until ready to use. Roll out as for standard
pastry. Follow specific recipe directions (for single or double
crust) to fill and bake pie. Or bake without filling at 400 deg. for
10 minutes or until the pastry is light golden brown
