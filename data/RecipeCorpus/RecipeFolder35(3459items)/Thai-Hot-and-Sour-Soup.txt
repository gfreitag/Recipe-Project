Title: Thai Hot and Sour Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Thai
Yield: 4 servings
1    Med onion, thinly sliced
2    Thai or jalapenos, sliced
4 oz Fresh oriental mushrooms
8 oz Shrimp, small
1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
2 tb Scallions, thinly sliced
1/3 c  Cilantro leaves, fresh
5    Stalks fresh lemongrass
- or 4 strips lemon zest
1 tb Minced galangal OR ginger
4 c  Chicken stock
3 tb Fish sauce
1 ts Thai chili paste
1    Ripe tomato, eight wedges
Trim the top, bottom, and outer leaves of the lemongrass, using only
the tender inner portions.  Thinly slice the core on the diagonal.
Don't use dried lemongrass.  Substitute instead the 4 strips of lemon
zest and mince finely.

Combine the lemongrass, galangal chicken stock, fish sauce, and chili
paste in a large saucepan and bring to a boil.  Simmer 5 minutes.

Add the tomatoes, mushrooms (quartered), chilies, and shrimp and
simmer for another 2 minutes, or until the shrimp are firm and pink.
The soup can be prepared ahead to this stage.

Just before serving, pour in the lime juice, scallions, and cilantro.
Soup should be spicy and quite sour.  Add more/less lime juice/chili
paste for more/less tartness/hotness.  Suggest to your guests that
they eat around the lemongrass pieces.
