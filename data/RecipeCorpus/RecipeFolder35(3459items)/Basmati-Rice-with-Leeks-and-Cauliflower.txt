tsp of the salt. Return to a boil. Add the cardamon pods, cover, and
turn the heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and
allow the rice to relax covered, for 15 minutes.

oil until they soften, about 5 minutes. Add the anise or fennel seeds
and stir for a few seconds. Add the cauliflower and toss.

3. Stir in the remaining « tsp salt, pepper and stock. Bring to a
simmer over medium heat until the stock has evaporated and the
cauliflower is just cooked through, 4-5 minutes.

4. Stir the rice into the vegetables.

Optional: 5. Spread the Red Bean Sauce on individual plates and top
with the rice, leek, and cauliflower mixture. Serve hot or at room
temperature.

Serves 8 as the base for beans, 10 to 12 as a side dish.
