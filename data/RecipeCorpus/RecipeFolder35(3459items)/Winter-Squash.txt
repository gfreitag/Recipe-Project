Prep Tips

A pound of squash usually yields about 1 3/4 cups of cooked meat.

To cut a small winter squash, first knock off the dried stem by
pressing it firmly against the counter. Then, with a whack, sink the
blade (not the tip) of a large chef's knife or cleaver into the
squash, and press down on it heavily or tap it with a mallet, using a
rocking motion to help the knife work its way through.

To peel squash whose surfaces are warty or convoluted, first stem cut
and seeded pieces until tender, at least 20 minutes. Or brush squash
pieces with oil and bake, cut side down, at 350øF for a bout 30
minutes, until the skin is soft when pressed. Then slice off the skin.

To bake whole squash, pierce it in several places with a knife, then
set it in a baking dish and bake at 350øF for 1 hour, or until
tender. Halve the squash, remove the seeds, season and eat (you can
roast and salt the seeds for great out-of-hand eating). Or scoop out
the meat to use for a pure, pie, soup or other dish.

Quick Fixes
