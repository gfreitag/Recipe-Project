ARTICHOKES 1. Choose artichokes that are uniformly green, with a
compact globe shape and tightly adhering leaves. Size doesn't affect
quality or flavor, but do handle artichokes of similar size together.

2. Remove the outer leaves until you come to light yellow or white
leaves or bracts. Cut off the tops of the buds and trim the heart and
stem to a cone shape. Wash each heart in cold water just as soon as
you've finished trimming it. Drain.

3. Blanch 7 minutes. Cool; drain well.

4. Pack into containers.

5. Seal, label, and freeze.

6. Cook frozen artichokes about 5 to 10 minutes or until tender.

ASPARAGUS 1. Choose very fresh stalks that are brittle and beautifully
green. The tips should be compact and tightly closed.

2. Wash well and sort by size. Remove scales with a sharp knife.

3. Break off the tough ends. Leave the stalks whole or cut into 1 or
2 inch lengths.

4. Blanch small stalks for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes; medium stalks 2 to 3
minutes; large stalks 3 to 4 minutes. Cool; drain well.

5. Tray freeze or pack into containers, alternating tip and stem
ends.

6. Seal, label, and freeze.

7. Cook frozen asparagus 5 to 10 minutes.
