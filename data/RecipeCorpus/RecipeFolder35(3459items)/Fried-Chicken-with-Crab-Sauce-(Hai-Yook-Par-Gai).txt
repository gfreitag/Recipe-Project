Crab sauce:  Flake crab, removing any bony tissue.  Heat oil in small
sauce pan and fry ginger and spring onions on low heat, not allowing
to brown. Add stock, bring to boil.  Add crab meat and season with
pepper. When sauce begins to boil, dribble in egg white, stirring
with a fork. It will set in shreds.  Stir in arrowroot mixed with
cold water, cooking until clear and thick.
