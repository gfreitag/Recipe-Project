Drain the wheat berries and chick-peas and set aside. To a large,

onions, garlic and turnips. Tie the celery, carrots, parsley and
peppercorns in a cheesecloth sack for easy removal and tuck into the
pot. Simmer, covered, for 1¬ hours.

Lift out the chicken, marrow bones and bundle of vegetables. Set the
chicken aside to cool and discard the bones and the bag of vegetables.
Pure the soup and the remaining vegetables in a food processor in
batches, returning each batch to the pot. Bring to a boil again, add
the soaked chick-peas and wheat berries, lower the heat and simmer,
covered, for 45-60 minutes or until the grain and chick-peas are
tender.

Meanwhile, when the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the skin
and the bones and discard them. Tear the chicken meat into large
pieces and add to the pot. Add salt. In a small skillet, melt the
butter and stir in the Syrian Mixed Spices. Dribble over the soup
before serving right from the pot. The spices will float on top,
dotting the surface in a polka-dot design. Ladle into soup b owls
while the soup is still piping hot.
