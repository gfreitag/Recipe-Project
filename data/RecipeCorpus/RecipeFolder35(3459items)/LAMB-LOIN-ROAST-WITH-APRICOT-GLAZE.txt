Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 servings

1 ts Olive oil
2 ts Chopped fresh rosemary
1 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Seasoned pepper
Festive rice
1 ea (2 1/2- to 3-pound) lean
-fresh lamb loin roast,
Bone-in (bone Just cut
-through at one-inch
-intervals)
1/2 c  Apricot jam
1 tb Horseradish
In a small bowl, blend apricot jam, horseradish and mustard; set
aside. To prepare roast: Place bone side down on flat surface. Pull
meat flap down to be even with bone and form roast into a tight roll.
Tie string around length of roast to prevent bones from spreading.
Tie roast at one-inch intervals, securing the rolled shape, making
sure string does not slip into cuts. Using a roasting pan with rack,
place lamb on rack, bone side down. Brush with olive oil and rub
rosemary, garlic powder and seasoned pepper. Roast lamb in preheated
350-degree oven to desired degree of doneness; 31 to 35 minutes per
pound or 150 degrees for medium-rare, 36 to 38 minutes per pound or
160 degrees for medium. During the last 30 minutes of roasting, brush
with apricot glaze several times. When the lamb is done, remove from
oven, cover and let stand for 10 minutes. Slice and serve over
festive rice. Makes four servings.  Tip: How to order roast: Ask for
a lamb loin roast, bone-in.  Have meat cutter cut through bone at
about one-inch intervals so roast can be sliced. Cuts should be no
more than one inch deep. Festive Rice: In large skillet melt one-half
cup butter or margarine and saute 1 1/4 cups diced mixed dried
fruits, one-third cup slivered almonds and one-quarter cup sliced
green onion for two to three minutes. Serve in three cups cooked rice
and heat through. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
