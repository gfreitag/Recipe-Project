ds Salt
2 cn Crushed pineapple, drained .
Use 1 lb 4 oz cans
1 lb Cooked extra wide noodles

Combine all ingredients except egg whites.  Beat egg whites and fold
into batter.  Pour into 9" x 13: glass baking pan.  Sprinkle a little
extra cinnamon on top. Bake 1 hour at 350.

Note: Folks raved and wanted recipe. I used yolkless noodles, no fat
cottage cheese, sour cream and butter. Next time I will try it with
egg beaters.  I really don't think the eggs needed to be separated.
