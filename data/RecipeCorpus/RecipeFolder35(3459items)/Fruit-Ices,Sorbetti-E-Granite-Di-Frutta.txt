Italian ices have been a traditional treat in Italy for centuries. The
distinction between sorbetti and granite is not exactly clear. I like
to think of a sorbet as having a puree of fruit as the base and a
granita only fruit juice. Sorbetti need to be frozen in an ice cream
maker, whereas granite, which are more icy and granular, can be
frozen in a bowl in your freezer. Whichever you choose, these cold
confections are a perfect ending to any meal. Serve with almond
biscotti.

Note: If you prepare a sorbet or granita a day or more in advance, it
will become too hard to scoop and serve. In that case, allow it to
defrost slightly for 2 to 3 hours in your refrigerator before serving.
