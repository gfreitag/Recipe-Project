Categories: Cake/cookie, Chocolate, Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM-------------------------CAKE-----------------------------------
4 lg Eggs
1 1/2 ts Vanilla Extract
4 c  All-Purpose Flour
1 ts Kosher Salt
3 ts Baking Powder
4 lg Bartlett Pears, Firm; Peel,
Halve, Core -- cut in
1/4    " slices
1/2 lb Unsalted Butter -- softened
2 1/2 c  Sugar
MMMMM-------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
1 c  Heavy Cream
2 tb Brandy
6 oz Bittersweet Chocolate --
Coarsely chopped
1. Preheat oven to 400 F. Butter and flour a 10-inch tube pan. 2.
Spread the pear slices on a baking sheet and roast until tender,
about 10 mins. Transfer the pears to a food processor and puree until
smooth. Set aside. Reduce to oven to 350 F. 3. Cream the butter and
sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add the eggs,
one at a time, mixing until very light; batter may appear curdled at
this point. Mix in vanilla and the pear puree. Sift together the
flour, salt, and baking powder. Mix dry ingredients into the batter
just until combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake
until the top springs back when touched in the center, about 1 hour.
Place on a rack to cool. Turn the cake out of the pan and re-invert
onto a cake plate. 4. Put the chocolate in a double boiler over
barely simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted. Whisk in the
cream and brandy. If the sauce was made ahead, rewarm before serving.
To serve, place a slice of cake on a plate and spoon the chocolate
sauce beside it. Serves 8 to 10.
