Title: Skeleton Bones
Categories: Snacks, Holiday, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 c  Salted almonds
1 3/4 c  Flour
4 lg Egg whites
1 3/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Grated orange peel
With an electric mixer on medium speed, beat egg whites and sugar with
orange peel and baking powder until blended.  Gradually add nuts and
flour, beating until mixture is thoroughly mixed.

Cover and chill until firm enough to handle, at least 1 hour or up to
1 day.

Lightly flour your hands and pinch off a 3-Tbsp-size piece of dough.
On a lightly floured board, use the palms of both hands to evenly
roll an 8-inch-long rope.  Cut rope in half; roll each half out again
to 8 inches. Fold 1 inch of each end back onto rope; pinch ends to
make bone-end shapes. Repeat to shape all the dough.

Place bones 1 inch apart on buttered and flour-dusted 12x15 inch
baking sheets.  Bake in a 325~ oven until cookies are lightly browned
on bottoms, about 20 minutes.  (If using 2 pans in 1 oven, switch
positions halfway through baking).  With a wide spatula, transfer
bones to racks to cool. Serve or store airtight up to 3 days.

Makes about 2 dozen.

Notes: Be sure to use *only* the 3-Tbsp-size dough to size bones. Any
bigger and you'll end up with clubs, not bones.  The finished shape
looks like a femur (thigh-bone).  Also, try rolling the dough out and
use bone-shaped cookie cutters.  Don't place cookies closer than
1-inch apart - they spread during baking!
