Title: My Basic Baking Mix
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM----------------------MM BY H. PEAGRAM---------------------------
4 tb Baking powder
1 tb Salt
9 c  Flour
1 lb Shortening
This is best made in a food processor, but can be done by hand. In
processor, just throw everything in; process just enough to make a
crumbly mixture.  By hand, put flour, salt and baking powder in a
large bowl and mix.  Add shortening and blend in with pastry blender
or knives. Keep in airtight container away from heat. Use in any
bisquik or baking mix recipes.
