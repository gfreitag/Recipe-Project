Categories: Aust/german, Holiday, Cake/cookie
Yield: 30 servings
1/2 c  Unsalted butter -- at room
Temperature
3/4 c  Firmly packed light brown
Sugar
1/4 c  Light molasses --
Unsulfured
1    Egg
2 c  Confectioners' sugar -- for
Dusting (approx)
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Crushed aniseeds
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Ground allspice
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
1/8 ts Ground cloves
In a medium bowl, sift together flour, salt, pepper, aniseeds,
cinnamon, baking soda, allspice, nutmeg and cloves. In a large bowl,
using an electric mixer set on medium speed, beat together butter,
brown sugar and molasses until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.
Beat in the egg. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour
mixture. Cover and refrigerate for several hours. Position rack in
middle of oven and preheat to 350~F. Butter 2 baking sheets. Scoop up
pieces of the dough and roll between your palms into balls 1 1/2
inches in diameter. Place the balls on the baking sheets, spacing
them about 2 inches apart. Bake until cookies are golden brown on the
bottom and firm to the touch, about 14 minutes. Transfer baking
sheets to racks and let cookies cool slightly on the sheets. Place
confectioners' sugar in a sturdy paper bag. Drop a few cookies into
bag, close top securely and shake gently to coat the warm cookies
with the sugar. Transfer to racks and let cool completely. Repeat
with the remaining cookies. Store in airtight containers at cool room
temperature for up to 1 week. Makes about 2 1/2 dozen cookies.
