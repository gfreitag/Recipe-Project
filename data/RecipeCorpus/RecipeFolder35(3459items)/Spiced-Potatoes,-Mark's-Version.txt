Categories: Side dish, Indian, Vegetables, Potatoes
Yield: 4 servings
3 ea Dried red chiles
1 ea Bay leaf
1 1/2 ts Chili powder
1 ts Turmeric
2 ts Garam masala
1/4 c  Cilantro, chopped
4 tb Vegetable oil
6 md Potatoes, cut into bite-
-- sized pieces
1 md Onion, very finely chopped
2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
Salt & pepper
Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan with a good base over medium
heat. When hot, put in the potatoes & stir well.  Reduce the heat to
low & cook very gently, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.  Add
the onion & garlic & continue to cook over the low heat for another
10 minutes.  By this time, the potatoes should be cooked through.  If
not, cook them for another 5 minutes.  Be careful that you do not
overcook them or else you may get a soggy mess.  Season with salt &
pepper.

Crumble in the red chiles & stir in the bay leaf.  Add the remaining
spices in order, except for the cilantro, & continue to cook over the
low heat & stirring once or twice for a further 5 minutes.  If you
have the heat very low, you should not have a problem with it
sticking.  If it does stick, sprinkle in a few drops of water.  Stir
in the cilantro & serve immediately.
