Make a sponge in a small bowl by dissolving the yeast in the warm
milk, then stirring in 2 tablespoons each of the sugar and the flour.
Let sit covered for about 10 minutes. In a medium-size bowl cream the
butter, then slowly beat in the remaining sugar until smooth. Stir in
the egg yolks, cream, lemon rind, mace, salt, the sponge, and the
remaining flour. Beat 100 strokes.  In a separate bowl beat the egg
whites until stiff, then mix them into the dough by cutting through
the batter with a spatula and folding the whites in as best you can;
this is more difficult with an elastic yeast dough, and you won't
incorporate them completely. Now cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
place over a bowl of warm water. Let rise 1 hour. With a spatula cut
through the dough to break it down. Using well-floured fingers, pull
off pieces of dough about the size of ping-pong balls and slap them
down onto a floured surface; the dough will be soft and very sticky.
Pat gently - always with well-floured fingers - to make rough circles
and place them 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Paint the
tops with egg glaze. Then make an indentation with the back of a
floured spoon in the center of each round and fill with about 1
teaspoonful of jam. Let rise for 30 minutes in a warmish place. Bake
in a preheated 375 F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.  Serve warm. The Book
