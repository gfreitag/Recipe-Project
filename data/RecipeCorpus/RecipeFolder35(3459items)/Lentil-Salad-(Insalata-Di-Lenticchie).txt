Simple but very satisfying. Serve this salad on a bed of crisp greens
with some fresh crusty bread.

1 cup brown lentils 4 cups water Salt and freshly ground black pepper
to taste 1/4 cup chopped red onion 1/2 cup finely chopped carrot 1
tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1
tablespoon red wine vinegar

1. Combine the lentils and water in a large saucepan and bring the
water to a boil over high heat. Then cover the pan, reduce the heat
to medium-low, and simmer for 30 to 35 minutes, until the lentils are
tender. Drain well, cover, and allow to cool to room temperature.

2. Transfer the lentils to a medium-size serving bowl and season with
salt and pepper. Add the onion, carrot, parsley, olive oil, and
vinegar and toss well to combine before serving.
