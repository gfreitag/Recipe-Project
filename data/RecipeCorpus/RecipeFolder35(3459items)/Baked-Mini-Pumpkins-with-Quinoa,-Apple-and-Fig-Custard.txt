Categories: Vegetables, Nuts/grains
Yield: 8 servings
1 md Granny Smith apple
-peeled, finely chopped
A few drops of lemon juice
6    To 8 dried figs, diced
1/2 c  Toasted pecans,
-coarsely broken
1 c  Heavy cream
1 tb Fine sugar
1 ts Brandy
Fig leaves for plates (opt)
8    Miniature pumpkins
-(3/4 lb ea)
1 1/2 c  Milk
3    Eggs
1 pn Salt
1/2 c  Light brown sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 3/4 c  Cooked quinoa (use Method 1)
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Pumpkin pie spice
Slice off the stem ends of the pumpkins about 1 inch down, making a
lid. Set the lids aside. Scoop out and discard the seeds and strings
from the center, leaving about a 1/2-3/4 inch wall. Place the
pumpkins in one or two shallow baking dishes.

Preheat oven to 350Ã¸F and boil a kettle of water. In a large mixing
bowl, add the milk and eggs and whisk to combine. Add the salt,
sugar, vanilla and whisk again. Then stir in the cooked quinoa and
the remaining ingredients except the heavy cream, sugar and  brandy.
Fill each pumpkin with 4-5 tablespoons of the filling. Pour 1 inch of
boiling water into the bottom of the pans and bake for 45-60 minutes.
Test the flesh of the pumpkin with the point of a knife to see if
they are tender. Remove them from the oven and cool to lukewarm.

Whip the ream and sugar with a beater until stiff. Then whip in the
brandy and set aside.

Serve the pumpkins warm on a fig leaf or a paper doily. Place the
reserved lid on the side of the plate for decoration and spoon some
brandied whipped cream on top of each pumpkin.
