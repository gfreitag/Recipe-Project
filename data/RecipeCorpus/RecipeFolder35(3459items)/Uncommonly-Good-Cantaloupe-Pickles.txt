Categories: Can/preserv, Pickles
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Whole cloves
1 ts Ground mace
4 c  Brown sugar
1 md Not quite ripe cantaloupe
1 qt Vinegar
2 c  Water
2 ea Sticks cinnamon
These are extraordinarily good pickles to serve at parties or company
dinners. The recipe makes four 1/2 pint jars. You will need all the
basic equipment plus a large saucepan and mixing bowl and a
cheesecloth spice bag.

1. Peel and seed the cantaloupe, cut it into 1 inch chunks and put in
large mixing bowl.

2. In a saucepan, combine vinegar and water. Tie whole spices in a
cheesecloth bag and add to the saucepan along with mace. Heat to
boiling.

3. Pour boiling, spiced vinegar over cantaloupe in mixing bowl. Set
the bowl aside and let it stand overnight.

4. Organize ingredients, equipment, and work space.

5. Drain vinegar into saucepan and heat to boiling. Add cantaloupe and
sugar; heat to boiling, then reduce the heat and simmer about 1 hour,
or until transparent.

6. Meanwhile, wash and rinse jars; keep them hot in a low oven or pan
of hot water.

7. Pack hot cantaloupe into the hot jars to within 1/2 inch of tops.

8. Boil the vinegar sugar mixture about 5 minutes or until syrupy.

9. Pour the syrup into hot jars to within 1/2 inch of tops. Run a
slim, non metal tool down along the insides of jars to release any
air bubbles. Add additional syrup, if necessary, to within 1/2 inch
of tops.

10. Wipe tops and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth.

11. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

12. Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. Follow the basic
steps for boiling water bath canning, 10 through 18.
