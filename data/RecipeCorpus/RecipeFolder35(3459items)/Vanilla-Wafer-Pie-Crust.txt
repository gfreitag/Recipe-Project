Title: Vanilla Wafer Pie Crust
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
40 ea Vanilla wafers
6 tb Butter
Melt butter. Crush wafers very fine. Mix together and press into a
pie pan. You can put it in the freezer while you make the filling. It
compliments the filling and does not overpower it like the graham
crust does. By Linda McBee From recipe collection of Ellen Cleary
