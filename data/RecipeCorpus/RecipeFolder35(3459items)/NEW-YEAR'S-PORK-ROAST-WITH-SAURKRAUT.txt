Categories: Meats, Main dish, Sandwich, Holiday
Yield: 4 servings
1    PORK ROAST
1    HOT DOGS WITH SKIN
1    SAURKRAUT
1    BEER
1    MASHED POTATOES
Put the pork roast in a roasting pan on a RACK.  Fill the roasting
pan with saurkraut and cover.

At midnight on New Year's Eve put it into a 175 f oven.  When you
wake in the morning (on New Year's Day) check to see if the pork
roast is dry.  If it is add beer; either way, let it cook until noon.

At noon bury the hot dogs in the saurkraut for 15-30 minutes and
serve hot dogs with saurkraut.   Let the roast cook for 4-5 more
hours.

Make mashed potatoes and spread the pork and saurkraut all over the
whole works.   Eat.

*If you use hotdogs without skin they will fall apart.
