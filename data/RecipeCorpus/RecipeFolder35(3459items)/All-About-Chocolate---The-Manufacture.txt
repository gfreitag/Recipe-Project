The sacks of cacao beans are opened at the chocolate factory and
carefully inspected for quality and then cleaned thoroughly.  Next,
the beans are roasted in rotating machines at very high temperatures
to bring out the distinctive chocolate aroma.  The roasting process
lasts from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on the variety and
condition of the particular bean. Buring the process, a skilled
supervisor periodically takes samples to assure a uniform quality of
roasst.  When the beans are properly roasted, they are cooled quickly
and their thin shells are removed by a "cracker and fanner".  The
remaining meat of the bean, called the nib, is ground between heavy
steel discs.  During the grinding process, the heat releases the
cocoa butter in the nibs, forming a semi-liquid paste, known as the
chocolate flavor liquor.  This semi-liquid paste is then poured into
molds and allowed to cool until hard. The resulting cakes are
familiar to every homemaker.  They are unsweetened or bitter
chocolate. The make cocoa powder, the chocolate liquor is melted and
placed in a hydraulic press. Chocolate liquor contains about 50%
cocoa butter. Part of this cocoa butter is squeezed out under
tremendous pressure. The remaining hard mass, known as "cocoa cake,"
is ground into a fine powder. This is packaged and sold in
supermarkets as ordinary cocoa of "breakfast cocoa."  "Ready to
serve" or "sweet milk cocoa: is a combination of cocoa powder, sugar
and milk. Milk chocolate is made by adding sugar, cocoa butter and
milk solids to the chocolate liquor according to standard formulas.
This liquid mixture is then formed into the familiar bars, patties,
Easter bunnies, etc. Origin: Farm Journal's Choice Chocolate Recipes
