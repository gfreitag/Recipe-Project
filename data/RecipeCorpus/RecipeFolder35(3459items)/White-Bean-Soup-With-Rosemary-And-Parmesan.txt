A sturdy soup that is a meal in itself, this is a popular dish in
northern Italy, especially Tuscany, where the locals are nicknamed
mangiafagioli, or "bean eaters."  Feel free to substitute other dried
beans such as chick-peas (garbanzo beans), white kidney beans or
cannellini beans. If you like, garnish with croutons in addition to
the Parmesan and parsley.

Pick over and discard any damaged beans or stones.  Rinse the beans.
Place in a bowl, add plenty of water to cover and soak for about 3
hours. Drain the beans and set aside.

In a large soup pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the
onion, carrot and celery and saute, stirring, until the vegetables
are soft, about 10 minutes.

Add the garlic and rosemary and continue to saute for 3 minutes. Add
the drained beans and the stock or water. Bring to a boil, reduce the
heat to low and simmer gently, uncovered, until tender, 1- 1-1/2
hours. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

Place one-third of the bean mixture in a blender or in a food
processor fitted with the metal blade.  Puree until smooth. Return
the puree to the soup and reheat gently. Season to taste with salt
and pepper.

Ladle the soup into individual bowls.  Garnish with the Parmesan
cheese and parsley and serve immediately.
