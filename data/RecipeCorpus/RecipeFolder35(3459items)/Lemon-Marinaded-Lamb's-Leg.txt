Here's something I tried last week: I marinaded cuts from a lamb's
leg in a marinade of olive oil, lemon juice, finely chopped onion and
garlic, salt, crushed peppercorns a bay leaf and a couple of sprigs
of fresh thyme. The marinade I usually make for this dish contains
white wine, which I had to substitute with lemon juice, because my
guest has to avoid alcohol for health reasons.

I sauteed the lamb in olive oil over very high heat, just so they were
browned on the outside yet still pink on the inside. I served them
with garlic and basil butter (with a pinch of ginger powder added).

Much to my surprise, I couldn't really taste the ingredients of the
marinade. When I used wine for this marinade I always could taste it.
The lemon juice seemed to blend in more with the taste of the lamb.
It made the meat more tender and the taste creamier. Somehow it
totally took away the sweaty part of the taste of lamb while subtly
enhancing the more appealing parts.
