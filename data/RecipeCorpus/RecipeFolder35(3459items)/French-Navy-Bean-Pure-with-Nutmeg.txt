Salt and pepper to taste

To a 3-qt. saucepan, add beans and water to cover by 2 inches. Add
carrot, onion and garlic. Tie parsley, thyme and bay leaf together
with string and add to the pot. Bring to a boil, lower heat and
simmer with the pot lid slightly ajar, until the beans are tender.
(If current-crop French navy beans are used, the time should be about
30 minutes. If marrow beans are used, increase cooking time to 1¬
hours and check to see if additional water is needed so that the
beans remain covered.) Remove and discard the carrot, onion, herbs
and bay leaf. Drain beans, transfer to the bowl of a food processor,
add the butter, cream, salt, pepper and nutmeg and process to a
pure. Scrape pure into an ovenproof and serve warm.
