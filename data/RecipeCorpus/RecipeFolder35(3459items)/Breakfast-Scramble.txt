Melt butter in a wide frying pan over medium high heat.  Add potatoes;
cook, turning occasionally with a spatula, until lightly browned,

onion and bell pepper over potatoes; cook for about 1 more minute.
Meanwhile in a small bowl, beat eggs, water, hot pepper sauce, lemon

uncooked egg flow underneath; repeat until eggs are done to your
liking.  Season to taste with salt; top with sour cream, if desired.
