Categories: Appetizers, Holiday, Kids
Yield: 1 servings
Salt
1 lg Pumpkin
Butter or margarine, melted
Scoop the seeds and pulp from lg. pumpkin.  Seperate the seeds and
wash in cold water in a colander.  When seeds are dry spread them out
on a cookie sheet and toast in oven at 400 degrees.  Stir frequently
and watch closely. They don't taste good burned!  It usually takes
about 30 minutes to toast but check at 15 - 20 minutes for crispness.
Put warm seeds in a bowl and toss with a little melted butter and
salt. Submitted By SUE TOLENE   On   10-10-95
