Title: Eboney And Ivory Chocolate Truffles
Categories: Chocolate, Candies
Yield: 1 servings
-into 1/4 inch pieces
6    Fluid oz. double cream
2 1/2 oz Cocoa powder
7 1/2 oz White chocolate, chopped
-into 1/4 inch pieces
8 oz Plain chocolate, chopped
Place the white and dark chocolates into separate stainless steel
bowls. Heat the cream in a 2-pint saucepan over medium heat. Bring to
a boil. pour 2 fluid oz. of boiling cream over the white chocolate
and the remaining over the dark chocolate and allow to stand for 4 to
5 minutes. Stir each with a spearate whisk until smooth and allow to
cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Refrigerate the two ganaches for
15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Line a baking sheet with
greaseproof paper. Portion 36 heaping tsp. of dark chocolate into
separate mounds onto the greaseproof paper. Top each tsp. of dark
chocolate with a level tsp. of white chocolate. To fashion the
truffles, roll each portion of chocolate in your palms in a gentle
circular motion, using just enough pressure to form smooth rounds.
Roll the rounds of chocolate in cocoa powder till completely covered.
In place of cocoa powder, you may enrobe the truffles with several
other coatings, like chopped nuts, shredded coconut or the Ultimate
Chocolate Ganache. Or you can place a pistachio or hazelnut in the
center of the chocolate-truffle mixture and roll the chocolate around
the nut. Truffles may be refrigerated for several days before
serving. Do, however, bring the truffles to room temperature before
serving (15 to 20 minutes).

Notes: If the heat of the cream is not sufficient to thoroughly melt
the chocolate, or if the chocolate doesn not completely dissolve
while you are stirring, then place the bowl of chocolate over very
hot water (not simmering or boiling) and continue to stir to a smooth
texture.

Makes about 3 dozen.
