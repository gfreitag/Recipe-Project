Put the crust ingredients in the machine's bread pan. Use the RISE
setting so that the machine will mix, knead, and allow the dough to
rise. Roll the dough into a 15-inch circle. Place it in a 14-inch
pizza pan coated with cooking spray, and form a rim of dough around
the edges.

Cut a 7-inch "X" in the center of the dough. Cut another "X" to form
eight wedges in the center. Combine the tomato paste and garlic, and
spread the mixture in a 3-inch-wide border evenly around the edges of
dough. Top the tomato paste with the remaining ingredients in the
order listed. Pull the cut points of dough over the filling. Moisten
the points with water and tuck under the outer rim. Press to firmly
seal. Bake at 425 F for 15 to 18 mins. THis recipe makes 8 slices.
