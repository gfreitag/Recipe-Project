Tear raisins into variously sized scab like pieces and set aside.

Toast bread until golden brown.

Carefully place hot toast on a plate.

Spread each slice of toast first with butter and then with jam.
Artfully arrange scabs on jam and eat. Serves 1 wounded worshiper.

Sicko serving suggestion: Surreptitously place a raisin scab on the
gauze part of a sterile, non-medicated, bandage and apply it to the
clean, dry appendage of your choice. Then tell your intended victim
that you're so hungry you could eat a scab. Whip off your bandage and
chow do
