beans and wash again. Wash the green beans, trim, string, and cut

pan boil beans 3 minutes. Drain both vegetables. Cut corn from cob
and mix with hot, drained beans.

5. Pack hot vegetables into hot jars to within 1 inch of tops. Add 1/2
teaspoon salt to each pint, 1 teaspoon to quarts, if desired. Add
boiling water to within 1 inch of tops of jars.

6. Run a slim, non metal tool down along the inside of each jar to
release air bubbles. Add more boiling water to within 1 inch of tops.

7. Wipe tops and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth.

8. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.
