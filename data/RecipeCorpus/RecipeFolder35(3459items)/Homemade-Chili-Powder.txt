Title: Homemade Chili Powder
Categories: Herbs/spice, Chili, Low cal/fat
Yield: 1 cup
2 ts Cumin seeds
2 ts Dried oregano
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
2    Dried ancho chilies
2    Dried pasilla
-or mulato chilies
4    Dried chipotle chilies
Preheat oven to 300Ã¸F. Stem the chilies and roast them on a baking
sheet for 10 minutes, or until crisp. Let cool. Place the cumin seeds
in a dry skillet over medium heat and cook for 30 seconds, or until
fragrant and lightly toasted.

Break the chilies open and shake out the seeds. For a hotter chili
powder, leave the seeds in. Combine the chili pieces, cumin seeds,
and other spices and grind to a fine powder in a spice mill. Store in
an airtight container.

Note: This powder isn't particularly hot, but it's loaded with flavor.
