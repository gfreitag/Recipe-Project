Title: Vanilla Custard For Dessert Tostada
Categories: Masterchefs, Tex/mexican, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
5 oz Sugar
10    Egg yolks
13    Fluid ounces  Heavy cream
In a two quart saucepan, bring sugar and cream to a boil. Whisk in egg
yolks, turn heat to low, and continue to stir constantly until custard
thickens and thoroughly coats a spoon.

Strain custard into a stainless steel bowl set inside another bowl
filled with ice and stir frequently. This is to ensure rapid cooling
of custard so that it does not curdle. Wrap custard and reserve in the
refrigerator.

NOTE:
This recipe is used to prepare the "Dessert Tostada" recipe in this
cookbook, but can be prepared on its own.
