Categories: Desserts, Pie/tart
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1/4 c  Unsalted butter -- cut into
-1/2" pieces
1 c  Graham cracker crumbs
1/4 c  Sugar
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 tb Unsalted butter -- softened
1 tb Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Heavy cream -- well chilled
8 oz Cream cheese -- softened
1 c  Creamy peanut butter
1 c  Powdered sugar
MMMMM-----------------------FUDGE TOPPING----------------------------
Chopped
1/2 c  Heavy cream
6 oz Semisweet chocolate --
Preheat the oven to 350.  In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker
crumbs, sugar and butter until well blended.  Press evenly into a
buttered 9" pie pan, reaching up to but not over the rim.  Bake until
lightly browned, about 10 minutes.  Cool the crust completely on a
wire rack. Beat the cream cheese and peanut butter with an electric
mixer at medium speed until well blended.  Add the powdered sugar,
butter and vanilla and continue beating until fluffy.  Whip the cream
until not quite stiff. Fold a large spoonful of the whipped cream
into the peanut butter mixture to lighten it; gently fold in the
remainder.  Carefully spoon the filling into the cooled crust,
spreading evenly.  Loosely cover the pie and refrigerate until firm,
about 3 hours.  (You can put it in the freezer, if you'd like to
speed it up.)  Bring the cream to a simmer in a small, heavy
saucepan. Add the chocolate and stir until smooth.  Set aside to cool
to lukewarm. Gently spread the topping over the cooled pie.
Refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours.  Serve cold.
