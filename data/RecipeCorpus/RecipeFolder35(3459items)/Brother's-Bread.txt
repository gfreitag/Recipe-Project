Title: Brother's Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 servings
6 c  Unbleached flour (to 7 cups)
Cornmeal
Vinegar
1 tb Active dry yeast
2 1/2 c  Warm water
1 tb Sugar
1 1/2 tb Salt
Combine yeast and water in large bowl, stirring until yeast is
dissolved. Stir in sugar and salt. Mix well. Set aside for 5 minutes.

Beat for 10 minutes, gradually adding flour until dough begins to
pull away from sides of the bowl.

Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Knead for 8 to 10 minutes until
dough is smooth and elastic, adding flour as necessary to prevent
stickiness.

Lightly oil a large bowl. Place dough in bowl and turn to coat on all
sides. Cover with plastic warap and let rise in a warm, draft free
place until doubled in bulk. About 1-1/2 hours.

Grease a baking sheet and sprinkle with cornmeal or line with kitchen
parchment.

Punch down the dough. Divide in half, shape into two round loaves and
place on the baking sheet. Carve an X in the top of the loaves and
spray lightly with vinegar. Place in cold oven and bake at 400
degrees F for 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Spraying with vinegar works better than placing a pan of hot water in
the oven while the bread is baking, and gives a nice, chewy surface.
There is no noticeable vinegar flavor in the crust after it is baked.

Makes 2 round loaves
