1/2 lb (2 cups) Cheddar cheese,
-grated
1/2 c  Margarine

processor, then place metal chopping blade in work bowl and add
margarine. Combine salt, paprika, and flour in separate bowl. Turn on
food processor, and slowly add flour mixture through the feed tube.
Stop processing as soon as ingredients are combined. Measure
approximately one teaspoon of this mixture and form an "eyeball"
around an olive.  Turn the olive in the "eyeball" so that it is
"staring" outward.  This recipe will yield about 24 "eyeballs".

Line up the eyeballs on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake in the oven

If you want to make these ahead of time, freeze them UNBAKED on the
cookie sheet and transfer to a plastic bag when frozen. Then just
thaw and bake when needed.
