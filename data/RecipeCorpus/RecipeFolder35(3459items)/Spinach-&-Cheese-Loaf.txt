Categories: Breadmaker, Breads
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM--------------------1  OR 1 1/2 POUND----------------------------
2 tb Mustard
1 pk (10 Oz) Spinach, Frozen,
-Chopped -- thawed
3 tb Parmesan Cheese -- grated
1 1/4 c  Swiss Cheese, Reduced-Fat --
-shredded
1 2/3 c  Bread Flour
3/4 c  Oat Bran
1 tb Sugar
2 ts Yeast
1/2 ts Sea Salt
3/4 c  Water
Put the first seven ingredients in the machine's bread pan. Turn the
machine in the RISE setting so that the machine will mix, knead, and
allow the dough to rise once. After the dough has risen, turn it onto
a lightly floured surface, and shape the dough into a 9 x 12-inch
rectangle. Place the dough on a baking sheet coated with cooking
spray.

Spread half of the shredded cheese over the center third of the
rectangle along the 12-inch length. Squeeze the excess water from the
spinach; combine the spinach and parmesan cheese, and spread it over
the shredded Swiss cheese. Top with the remaining shredded Swiss
cheese.

With a sharp knife, make cuts from the filling to the dough edges at
1-inch intervals along the sides of filling. Alternating sides, fold
strips at an angle over the filling. Cover and let rise in a warm,
draft-free place until it is doubled in size; about 30 mins. Brush
the top with egg white glaze or skim milk. Bake at 375 F for about 25
mins, until golden brown. Serve warm. This loaf makes 12 slices.
