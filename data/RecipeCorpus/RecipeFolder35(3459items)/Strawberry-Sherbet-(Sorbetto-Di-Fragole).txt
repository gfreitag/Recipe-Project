The sweet sensation of fresh strawberries makes this sorbetto
spectacular. You can even use out-of-season berries with excellent
results. The quantity of sugar syrup may vary, depending on how sweet
the strawberries are.

1 quart fresh strawberries, stems removed, butted, and cut in half
3/4 cup (about) Sugar Syrup 1 tablespoon sweet liqueur such as kirsch
(optional)

1. Place the strawberries in a food processor fitted with the
double-edge steel blade or a blender and puree. With the machine
running, add the sugar syrup slowly. Taste and add more if necessary.
Add the liqueur and continue processing for about 5 seconds longer.
The mixture will be quite thin.

2. Freeze the strawberry mixture in an ice cream maker according to
the manufacturer's directions. Transfer to a plastic container with a
tight-fitting lid and allow the sorbetto to harden in the freezer for
several hours before serving.
