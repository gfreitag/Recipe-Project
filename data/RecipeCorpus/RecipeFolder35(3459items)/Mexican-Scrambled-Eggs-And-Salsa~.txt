A colorful spicy salsa without the cholesterol!

Combine beans, tomatoes, corn, white parts of green onions, cilantro,
chile sauce, cumin, salt, and orange juice in a bowl. Drain and
reserve the juice from the combined ingredients. (about 2 minutes)
Mix arrowroot with a tiny amount of water. Pour arrowroot mixture
into reserved juice. Heat to thicken. Heat olive oil and toasted
sesame oil in a frypan. Add diced onion and saute over medium heat.
Add serrano chile and continue sauteing. Add tomatoes, cilantro and
eggs or egg substitute. Shake eggs down into the pan and leave alone.
Push to center once in a while. Let cook until set. Mix the yogurt
and chopped cilantro. (This will be used as the topping - like sour
cream) Pour heated sauce over salsa. (this makes it shiny)

To serve:  Take a spoonful of eggs and place on a hot tortilla. Place
another tortilla on top and another spoonful of egg mixture. Take a
heap of salsa and place around the sides of the tortilla and a dollop
of "sour cream" on top of the eggs.
