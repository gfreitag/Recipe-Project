Categories: Potatoes, Side dish, Low cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
-peeled, cut in 1" dice
Salt and pepper
1/2 c  Non-fat sour cream
1 pn Cayenne pepper
1/4 c  Vegetable stock
-or skim milk (opt)
1 tb Olive oil
1    Onion(s), finely chopped

1. Heat the oil in a large non-stick fry pan. Saut the onion and
garlic over medium heat for 6-8 minutes, or until golden brown,
stirring often. Add the curry powder after 4 minutes.

2. Cook the potatoes in at least 4 quarts of rapidly boiling salted
water until very tender, 10-15 minutes.

3, Thoroughly drain the potatoes in a colander. Return to the pot and
mash the potatoes. Do not pure the potatoes in a food processor, or
the mixture will become gummy.

4. Stir the onion mixture into the mashed potatoes with the sour
cream, salt and pepper and cayenne. If the potatoes seem dry, add a
little vegetable stock or skim milk. Correct the seasonings and serve
at once.

Note: This mixture also makes a great filling for turnover and pasta.
