Categories: Salads, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Salt
2 md Oranges
1/2 tb Olive oil
1 1/2 c  Onion(s), thinly sliced
4 md Beets (or 6-8 small ones)
1    Rosemary sprig
1/4 c  Rice vinegar
1/4 c  Orange juice
MMMMM-----------------------BEET DRESSING----------------------------
1 ts Balsamic vinegar
1 tb Olive oil
1. Remove the stems and leaves from the beets, leaving an inch or two
of stem attached to keep the beets from bleeding. (Save the young,
tender beet green. When blanched, they can substitute for Swiss
chard.) Scrub the beets with a vegetable brush to clean them. Steam
until almost soft, 15-20 minutes. Remove beets from steamer and set
aside to cool.

2. Reduce the liquid remaining in the pot to 1 cup. If you end up with
less, add enough water to make 1 cup.

3. Place the beet liquid, rosemary, rice vinegar, orange juice, and
salt in a saucepan and reduce over low heat until ¬ cup remains,
about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Set aside.

4. Meanwhile, peel and section the orange, removing the white
membrane. Set aside.

5. Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Add the
olive oil and then the onions, lower the heat to medium and saut the
onions until they're almost black, 10-15 minutes. Let cool.

6. When the beets have cooled, peel them and cut them into thin
strips.

Can be prepared to this point 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate until
ready to serve.

7. To make the beet dressing, add the olive oil and balsamic vinegar
to the reserve ¬ cup beet mixture and stir until blended.

8. Place the dressing in a bowl. Add the orange sections, sauted
onions, and julienned beets. Gently fold together and serve.
