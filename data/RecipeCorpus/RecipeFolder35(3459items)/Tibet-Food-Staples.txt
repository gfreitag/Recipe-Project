MMMMM-----------------------FOOD OF TIBET----------------------------
In their homeland, dishes use "Tsampa", a flour ground from roasted
barley. Tibetan staples include barley, yak meat, yak milk, and a tea
flavored with salt, baking soda and yak butter.  Yak meat is similar
to beef, but not quite.

Typical foods include noodles; goat cheese; a limited variety of
vegetables such as potatoes, radishes, cabbage, bok choy and
cauliflower; and some lamb, chicken, eggs and fish. Dinner might be a
meat broth with noodles. Sweets are rarely eaten, they eat fruit and
juice instead, or for some, a favorite dessert is sun dried yak
cheese.

Tibetans use mild seasonings and not too many spices. The Indian
influence is evident with the use of red and Basmati rice, the flat
chapati bread, and curried dishes. Noodles and the momos are of
Chinese origins.
