Title: Gingery Chicken & Spinach Soup
Categories: Main dish, Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
Breast halves
1/2 bn Green onion
2 c  Vermicelli
4 tb Lemon juice
Salt and pepper
Sesame seeds -- optional
1    Onion
1/2    Inch ginger root
1 tb Sesame oil
6 c  Chicken broth
10 oz Chopped spinach
1 lb Boneless skinless chicken
Finely chop the onion.  Peel and mince the ginger.  Heat the oil in a
soup pot over medium heat.  Add the onion and ginger, increase the
heat to high, and saute for a few seconds to release their aroma.
Add the broth and spinach.  Cover the pot and bring the liquid to a
boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the spinach is thawed, about
10 minutes.  Meanwhile cut the chicken into thin shreds or 3/4"
chunks.  Slice the green onions. When the spinach has thawed, stir
the soup, then add the chicken and noodles.  Cover and simmer
until the noodles and chicken are cooked, about 5 minutes.  Add the
green onions and the lemon juice.  Season to taste with salt and
pepper.  Serve immediately, passing the sesame seeds for sprinkling
over each portion.
