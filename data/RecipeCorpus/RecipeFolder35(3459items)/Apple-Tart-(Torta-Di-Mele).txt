This is my favorite tart. The layer of applesauce makes a delicate
filling and the sliced apples give a decorative finished appearance.

1 recipe Basic Pie Pastry (see preceding recipe) 1 cup prepared
unsweetened applesauce (preferably the kind you make yourself) 2 or 3
large, crisp, tart apples (Mcintosh, Macoun, Empire, or Granny Smith)
Juice of 1/2 lemon 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup apricot preserves

1. Preheat the oven to 375-F. Prepare the pie pastry, roll it out,
and line a 9-inch tart pan. Crimp the edges.

2. Spread the applesauce over the bottom of the pastry. Cut the
apples in quarters, peel, and cut away the cores. Cut each piece of
apple into evenly thin slices and arrange in an overlapping fashion
over the applesauce in concentric circles. Squeeze the juice over the
apple slices, sprinkle the sugar evenly over the top, and place on
the middle rack of the oven. Bake for about 1 hour, until the pastry
is golden brown and the edges of the apple slices begin to brown.
Remove from the oven and cool on a rack.

3. Just before serving, heat the preserves (you can do it easily in
the microwave: put the preserves in a microwave-safe, heat-proof glass
measuring cup, heat on high power for about 1 minute, until the
preserves are melted and bubbling), and use a teaspoon to spread
evenly over the top of the apples. Serve from the pan.
