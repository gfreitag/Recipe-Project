Title: Quark
Categories: Cheese/eggs
Yield: 3 servings
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
8 c  Whole milk
Place the milk and buttermilk in a stainless steel bowl. Cover and let
stand at room temperature for 24 hours.

After the milk has coagulated, remove the plastic wrap and place the
bowl over boiling water. Cook (do not stir) until the curd is semi
firm. Remove from heat and refrigerate until completely cool.

Line a strainer with cheesecloth. Pour in the cooled mixture and let
drain over a bowl or sink, draining out all the liquid. Remove the
quark from the cheesecloth and refrigerate until ready to use.
