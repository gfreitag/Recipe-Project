Baking yeast bread in Colorado is not difficult.  Bread dough doubles
in size more quickly at high altitudes than at low altitudes. The
rising time for your recipe should be decreased. The dough should be
allowed to rise only long enough to double its size. Allowing bread
dough to rise too long may cause over-fermentation resulting in bread
with a coarse open texture and a yeasty flavor.  To test whether or
not the dough is light enough to punch down, press tip of finger into
dough.  If a dent remains in the dough, it is ready to punch down.
The following adjustments may also help convert a bread recipe into
one suited for high altitudes:

Decrease yeast by 1/2 teaspoon for every tablespoon of yeast in the
recipe. Decrease sugar by 1 teaspoon for every tablespoon of sugar in
the recipe. Decrease total time for rising by about 30 minutes for a
two-loaf recipe. Flours tend to absorb more liquid in high, dry
climates such as Colorado's. Therefore try using a little less flour
in your recipe. However, it is best to judge by the "feel" of the
dough rather than the amount of flour used. Changes in weather and
humidity can also cause differences in the actual amount of flour
needed. Add flour until you have a soft dough that pulls away from
the sides of your mixing bowl. It is not necessary to adjust oven
temperature for yeast breads at high altitudes. Colorado Wheat
