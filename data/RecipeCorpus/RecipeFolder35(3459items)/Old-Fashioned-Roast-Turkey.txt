Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Oldies
Yield: 20 servings
1 ea 26-ounce jar spiced crab
-apples; drained
Fresh parsley sprigs
1 ea 12 to 14 pound turkey.
2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Butter or margarine; melted
-and divided
Remove giblets and neck from turkey.  Rinse turkey thoroughly with
cold water; pat dry.  Sprinkle salt over surface and in cavity of
turkey.
Close cavity of turkey with skewers; tie ends of legs to tail with
string or tuck them under flap of skin around tail.  Lift wingtips up
and over back so that they are tucked under turkey securely.
Brush entire turkey with about 1/4 cup melted butter; place breast
side up on rack in a roasting pan.  Insert meat thermometer in breast
or meaty part of thigh; making sure it does not touch bone.  Bake at
325 degrees F for 5 hours or until meat thermometer registers 190
degrees. Baste turkey frequently with remaining melted butter and pan
drippings. If turkey gets too brown during baking, cover lightly with
aluminum foil.
When turkey is two-thirds done, cut the cord or band of skin
holding the drumstick ends to the tail.  This will insure that the
inside of the thighs are thoroughly cooked.  Turkey is done when the
drumsticks are easy to move.
Transfer turkey from roasting pan to serving platter.  Let stand 15
minutes before carving.  Garnish with crab apples and parsley.
