1. Combine the onion, garlic, and olive oil in a large soup pot over
medium-low heat and cook until tender, about 5 mins. Add the beans and
broth. Season with salt and pepper and simmer until beans are almost
tender, about 1 hour. 2. When the beans are tender, add the carrots,
celery root, and turnip and continue simmering until vegetables are
barely tender, about 10 mins. Add the fusilli and simmer until pasta
is tender. Stir in the vinegar and adjust the seasoning with
additional salt and pepper. 3. While the soup is cooking, make the
pesto. Combine the sage, rosemary, garlic, tomatoes, and capers in a
blender or use a mortar and pestle to make a paste. Set aside. 4.
Ladle the soup into 4 large bowls. Swirl a spoonful of pesto into
each bowl, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and serve immediately.
Serves 8 as a first course or 4 as a main dish.
