Categories: Indian, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 batch
MMMMM------------------------SAMOSA DOUGH-----------------------------
5 tb Cold water
-- or as needed
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Oil
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Ground coriander
1/8 ts Turmeric
1/8 ts Ground ginger
1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
1/8 ts Ground cardamom
1/4 ts Sugar
Oil, for frying
1 tb Oil
1/2 md Onion
2 ea Garlic cloves
16 oz Cooked pumpkin puree
-- canned or homemade
1 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper, or to taste
In a food processor or by hand, combine flour and salt.  Add oil,
mixing until flour resembles fine crumbs.  Add just enough cold water
to form a medium-soft dough.  (If using a food processor, dough will
form a ball and leave sides of work bowl.)  Refrigerate dough,
covered, while you prepare filling.

In a skillet, saute onion and garlic in 1 tablespoon oil.  When onion
and garlic are soft and translucent, add pumpkin and seasonings. Cook
over medium heat, stirring frequently, until mixture it thick, about
10 minutes. Set aside to cool before filling samosas.

Assembly:  Roll out small 1-inch balls of dough into very thin
circles. Cut each circle in half.  Place a rounded teaspoonful of
filling into the middle of one semi-circle, then roll dough up to
encase filling, forming a cone-shape in which the circle's rounded
edge becomes the wide end of the cone.  Pinch wide end of cone
closed. Repeat for remaining dough and filling until all samosas are
filled.

Heat a couple of inches of oil over moderately-low heat.  Fry samosas
in hot oil until golden brown and crisp.  Remove and drain on
absorbent paper.
