Title: Cake (Vegan)
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Scant soy/ricemilk/water
-any works fine
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Oil; or 1/4c water plus
-oil
1 c  Sugar; or even 1/2c works
Bake at 375 for 30 mins in greased pan.

Natasha's notes:  This is a small recipe.  I'd double it for 4
servings, triple it if your house likes cake!

Natasha's variation suggestions:
sweet and light lemon cake:  add 1/4-1/2c lemon juice instead of
water/milk (for double-triple recipe)

orange cake:  add 2c orange juice instead of water and cut back sugar
(double recipe)

torte:  cut 1 or 2 apples into slices and lay them on top.  You can
sprinkle with cinnamon and or sugar if you'd like.
Plums actually work really well like this--cut them in half...you need
about 10.  Again, this works for double or triple recipe.  Be sure to
make this in a a large round pan for the right look.  You may also
want to use the full quantity of oil so that it's richer (instead of
eggs, you know).
