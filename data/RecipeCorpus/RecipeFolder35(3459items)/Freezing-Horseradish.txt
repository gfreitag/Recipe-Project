Title: Freezing Horseradish
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Grated horseradish
2 tb To 3 tbsp white vinegar
Yield varies widely depending on the size of the root and the method
of preparation.

1. Choose tender small to medium roots.

2. Wash well and remove small roots and stubs.

3. Pare and grate root outdoors, if possible; or if you must work
indoors, pare, cube, and grate the root in a blender or food
processor with tap water to cover or with a couple of ice cubes. Add
water until horseradish reaches desired consistency. Add 2 to 3
tablespoons of white vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt to each cup of
grated horseradish to stop enzyme action. THE EARLIER IN GRATING
PROCESS YOU ADD THE VINEGAR, THE MILDER THE HORSERADISH WILL BE.

4. Pack into jars, screw on lids, and freeze. Horseradish prepared in
this fashion can also be kept in jars in the refrigerator for a long
time. To use frozen horseradish, thaw to desired temperature.
