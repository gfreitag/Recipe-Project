Continued from **  Decorator Pie Shell   (part 1)  **

**  Reverse Bead  ** Press the rounded end of a chopstick into the
rim in two staggered rows.

**  Reverse Scallop  ** Use the tip of a vegetable peeler to leave
scalloped impressions. Hold either side of the peeler up, or
alternate the up and down positions for a more ruffly effect.

**  Ribbon  ** Arrange 1/2-inch wide dough strips in an undulating
wave pattern. Use the longest strips your dough allows without
breaking, and tuck under the loose ends in order to keep the pattern
even.

**  Rope  ** Gently squeeze the dough between the thumb and
forefinger of your right hand. To make the rope spiral the other way,
use your left hand.

**  Rose  ** Mold a grape-sized piece of dough into a narrow cone
about 1/4-inch long. Flatten a nickel-sized piece of dough into a
triangular shape resembling a guitar pick, then make the edges
irregular. Press one point of the triangle against the base of the
cone and let the broader part curl up and around and off the tip of
the cone to form the first petal. Continue adding ever smaller petals
in this way.

**  Stars  ** Use a small cookie or cana;e cutter to cut motifs such
as stars from the rolled pastry dough.

**  Teardrop  ** Use the metal hanging loop at the end of a wire whisk
handle to make these teardrop impressions.
