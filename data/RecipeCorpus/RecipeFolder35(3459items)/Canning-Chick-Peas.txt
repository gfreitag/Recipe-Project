Can your shelled chick peas for use in salads and casseroles. You'll
need all the basic equipment.

1. Choose only young, tender chick peas.

2. Organize and prepare equipment and work area.

3. Wash, drain, and shell. Wash again.

4. COLD PACK: Pack chick peas loosely into hot jars to within 1 inch
of tops of pint jars, 1-1/2 inches of tops of quarts. Don't press
down or shake peas to pack more in the jars. They need space to
expand as they cook. If desired, add 1/2 teaspoon salt to pint jars,
1 teaspoon to quarts. Pour in boiling water to within 1 inch of tops
of jars. HOT PACK: Cook chick peas in just enough boiling water to
cover for 3 minutes. Pack into hot jars to within 1 inch of tops. Add
1/2 teaspoon salt to pints, 1 teaspoon to quarts, if desired. Pour in
boiling water to within 1 inch of tops of jars.

5. Run a slim, non metal tool down along the inside of each jar to
release air bubbles. Add more boiling liquid to fill to within 1 inch
of tops.

6. Wipe tops and threads of jars with damp clean cloth.

7. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.

8. Process at 10 pounds pressure, 55 minutes for  pints, 1 hour and 5
minutes for quarts. Follow manufacturer's directions for your canner.

9. Follow basic steps for steam pressure canning, 10 through 24.
