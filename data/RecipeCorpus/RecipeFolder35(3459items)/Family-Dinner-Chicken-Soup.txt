Title: Family Dinner Chicken Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Poultry, Main dish, Crockpot
Yield: 1 servings
3 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Tabasco sauce
1 ts Salt
3 1/2 c  Water, or to cover
2 1/2 lb Chicken pieces
1    Onion; chopped
3    Potatoes; peel, dice
4    Carrots sliced
3    Stalks celery; sliced
Combine all ingredients in large kettle. Cover and cook on low heat 2
~ 3 hours. Stir occasionally. Add water if necessary. Before serving,
remove bones (this is dated 1926 - I think they were using stewing
hens, which are much tougher that the friers we get now. I only cook
this about 1 hour.The chicken should be tender enough to be falling
off the bone.)This can also be cooked on a Crockpot, on "low" about
10 - 12 hours. It's from a Tabasco Sauce ad, dated 1926/1976 and it's
as good as it sounds. Heather Smith near L.A. 'u'
