Title: Baklava 4
Categories: Desserts, Middle east
Yield: 6 servings
2 c  Sugar or honey
1    Geranium leaf or
1/2 ts Rose water Optional
1 c  Water
1 tb Lemon juice
2 c  Walnuts or pistachio nuts
-fine chopped
1 lb Package fyllo dough
1 lb Unsalted butter
1/2 c  Sugar
Syrup
If fyllo is frozen defrost at room temperature 4-5 hours. When
working with fyllo dough always keep sheets that are not being used
covered with a damp cloth.

Combine nuts and sugar, mixing well.  Set aside.  Butter the bottom
of a 14 X 10 inch baking pan.  Divide the package of fyllo dough into
two sections; leaving one half for the bottom layer and the other
half for the top. Melt the butter.  Lay 2 sheets of fyllo over the
bottom of the pan. Brush on butter then take two more sheets and lay
them over the two sheets in the pan.  Repeat this procedure until
half of the pound (of fyllo) is used. Spoon nuts evenly over the last
layer.

Continue to butter two sheets and place them over the nuts, repeating
the same procedure until all sheets are used. Brush the top layer
with butter. Cut into 1 1/2 inch diamond shaped pieces.

Bake at 300 degrees for 1 hour or until golden brown.  Remove from
oven and pour cold syrup over the Baklava.  Saturate well.

Syrup: If honey is substituted for sugar, use only 1/2 cup water in
the recipe, following these directions.

Combine sugar and water.  Stir until dissolved.  Boil over medium
heat for 5 minutes. Add lemon juice (and geranium leaf or rose water
if desired). Boil for 5 more minutes.  Remove from heat and cool.
