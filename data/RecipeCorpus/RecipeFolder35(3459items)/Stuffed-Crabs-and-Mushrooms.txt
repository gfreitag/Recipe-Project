Title: Stuffed Crabs and Mushrooms
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 6 servings
Juice of 1/2 lemon
1 ts Capers
1 ts Chopped parsley
2    Egg whites, beaten stiff
2 tb Butter
1 tb Flour
1/2 c  Cream
1 c  Mushrooms
1 lb Cooked crabmeat
Melt the butter and add the mushrooms, sliced or chopped.  Cook until
they are tender.  Remove the mushrooms or put them to one side of the
pan and add the flour.  When that is well blended add the cream.  When
the cream sauce is thick, remove from the fire and add the other
ingredients in the order given.  Put the mixture back into the crab
shells, or if the shells are not available ("this dish is delicious
made from canned crabmeat!"), bake in a buttered casserole in a
moderate oven (350) for about twenty minutes.  Eight
servings.--William's Recipe
