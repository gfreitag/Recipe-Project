Title: Kartoffle Bolla (Potato Balls)
Categories: Breads, Side dish, Penndutch, Potatoes
Yield: 1 batch
Salt and pepper to taste
Flour
8 md Potatoes; unpeeled
1    Onion; finely minced
1    Egg
Boil potatoes until tender and then cool thoroughly.

When quite cold, remove and discard skins.  Mash potatoes with a fork
and set aside.

Fry onion in a little butter until yellow-brown.  Add to potatoes
along with egg, salt, and pepper, and mix.  Add flour enough to mold
into balls; use only enough flour to hold the mixture together.

Drop the dumplings into boiling salted water or broth and cook
uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes.  When dumplings rise to the top they
should be cooked sufficiently, when remove from kettle with a skimmer
to a platter.

Serve cut in half and strewn over bread crumbs, browned in butter.
