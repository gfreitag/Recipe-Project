Title: Raised Doughnuts (Betty Crocker)
Categories: Breads, Pastry
Yield: 2 dozen
1/4 c  Water
1    Egg
1/4 c  Soft shortening
3 1/2 c  Flour
3/4 c  Milk, warm
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
1 pk Yeast
Soak yeast in water and set aside (5min).  Mix together milk, sugar
and salt. Add yeast. Stir in remaining ingredients. When the dough
begins to leave the sides of the bowl, turn it out on to a lightly
floured board to knead. Knead dough until it is smooth, elastic and
doesn't stick to the board.  Place in greased bowl turning once to
have the greased side up. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in
warm, draft free spot until double in size (1-2 hours).  Punch fist
into center of dough. Pull edges into center and turn completely over
in bowl. Let rise again until almost double (30-45 min).

Roll out dough 1/3" thick.  Cut with floured 3" doughnut cutter.  Let
rise on board until very light (30-45 min).  Leave uncovered so that
a crust will develop on the dough.  Drop into hot deep fat (375F)
Drain on absorbent paper.  For sugared doughnuts, place in bag with
granulated sugar and shake. From: Joan Mershon Date: 09-14-94
