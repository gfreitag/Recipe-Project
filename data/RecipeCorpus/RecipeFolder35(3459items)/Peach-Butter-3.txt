-peeled and pitted
And half as much sugar (2
-cups peaches and 1 cup
My M-I-L makes it as soon as the peaches are ready every summer and it
tastes just like eating a peach.  She usually cooks 12 cups peaches
and 6 cups of sugar per batch and usually makes 2 batches at a time.
It takes a very large pan to cook it in big batches, a dutch oven will
hold 6 cups peaches and 3 cups sugar very nicely.  It will bubble out
of the pan when it starts to bubble and thicken, so you don't want to
start out with a full pan.
