Title: Gianni's Bread And Cabbage Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 10 servings
1 c  Parmesan Cheese -- grated
4 oz (To 5) Pancetta Or Bacon --
-chopped
2 qt Beef Broth
1    (1 Lb) French Bread Loaf
1    Head Savoy Or Green Cabbage
(2-2 1/2 Lbs)
1 lb Fontina Cheese -- thinly
Sliced
1. Cut bread into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Core cabbage and thinly
slice. In a 6- to 8-qt pan, layer 1/3 each bread, cabbage, fontina,
and, finally, parmesan. Repeat, making 2 more layers. With your
palms, press ingredients firmly to level. 2. In a 3- to 4-qt pan over
medium-high heat, stir pancetta frequently until slightly crisp,
about 5 mins; discard fat. Scatter meat over cheese in soup pan. In
pancetta pan, bring broth to boiling and pour over layered
ingredients. 3. Cover soup pan tightly with a domed lid (or domed lid
made of foil); mixture puffs up, and cheese sticks if it touches the
lid. 4. Set soup pan in a rimmed pan to catch any overflow. Bake in a
400 F oven until a crusty crown forms, about 1 1/2 hours. Dip down
through ingredients and laadle soup into bowls. Makes 10 servings.
