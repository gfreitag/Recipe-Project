NOTE: If you can't buy squid already cleaned, here's how to handle
these whole mollusks.  If a recipe calls for tubes, buy twice as much
whole squid. You'll lose half the weight during cleaning.

TO CLEAN SQUID: 1. Cut off the tentacles just in front of the eyes. 2.
Using your thumb and forefinger, squeeze the cut edge of the tentacles
to coax the cartilage or "beak" out; discard the beak.  Rinse the
tentacles; if large, cut in half lengthwise, and set aside to
cook. 3. Pull the head and viscera out of the body tube and discard.
4. Pull the long clear quill out of the body tube and discard. 5.
Rinse the tube under cold running water and pull the skin (the colored
surface) off the tube; discard.  Run water inside the tube and
reach
inside to pull out any viscera that remains.  The tube should be
empty.  Slice or stuff.

Directions:

Combine the potatoes, onion, bell peppers, garlic, bay leaf and oil
in a 2-quart glass measure or casserole.  Cover with vented plastic
wrap or a lid and microwave on HIGH for 6 minutes.

Stir in the tomatoes, clam juice, wine and turmeric, re-cover and
microwave on HIGH for 6 minutes longer, or until bubbles form around
the edge. Cut the squid tubes crosswise into 1/4-inch rings; leave
the small tentacles whole and cut the large tentacles in half.

Stir the squid into the steaming mixture until the rings firm into "O"
shapes, about 1 minute.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
