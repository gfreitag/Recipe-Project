12 oz Fat free cottage cheese
1/3 c  Low-fat vanilla yogurt
3 tb Honey
3 ea Egg yolks (or 1/2 cup
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 c  White grape juice
optional: low calorie sweetener or a few drops to taste
1 1/2 cups washed fresh blueberries
3/4 cup washed, hulled sliced fresh strawberries
Combine cheese, yogurt, honey and egg yolks (or substitute) in
food processor or blender and process completely smooth. Combine
egg whites and salt in an electric mixing bowl and beat stiff.
Pour the cheese mixture into egg whites and gently but thoroughly
fold together. Spoon mixture into a non-stick 9-inch round cake
pan or springform pan that has been liberally sprayed with
cooking spray. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven 45 minutes.
Remove from oven and cool, then chill. Cake sinks in the middle
to form a depression for fruit filling. Remove the cake from pan
before filling.
To prepare filling: While the cheesecake is baking, simmer white
grape juice in an uncovered saucepan until reduced by half.
Remove from heat and allow to cool, add sweetener to taste. When
the cake is cool, arrange blueberries in the center surrounded
by a ring of sliced strawberries. Spoon the white grape glaze
over the fruit. Refrigerate and chill thoroughly. Yields 9
servings about 110 calories each. You could substitute white
Chardonnay or other white wine for part of the grape juice if so
inclined.
