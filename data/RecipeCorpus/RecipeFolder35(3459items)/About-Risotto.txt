To Ensure Perfect Risotto Every Time:

~ Use Arborio rice and never wash it.

~ Use a wide, heavy-bottom pot.

~ Never cover the pot.

~ Your risotto is only as good as the stock you use, so make sure
it's rich and flavorful. Non-vegetarians can experiment with check
and beef stocks.

~ Add the stock one ladle at a time. Don't let the liquid in the pan
totally evaporate before you add more. Keep the heat under the rice at
medium and the liquid at a quick simmer.

~ Keep a pot of stock simmering on a back burner and add a ladle each
time the rice appears to have absorbed most of the liquid. You
probably won't use all the stock called for in each recipe, but it's
better to heat extra stock than to run the risk of not having enough.

~ Stir frequently, especially when the rice is nearly done. However,
there's no need to stand in front of the pot and stir continuously
while the risotto is cooking.

~ The rice should be firm but tender, with no hard center core.
REmove the risotto from the heat as soon as it's cooked. Serve
immediately.
