Title: Bean Minestrone
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
16 oz Kidney beans
1/2 ts Dried marjoram
Salt and pepper
10 oz Chopped spinach -- thawed
1 c  Macaroni
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese -- grated
Fennel
1    Clove garlic
1    Bulb
2    Carrots
2 tb Olive oil
3 c  Water
28 oz Italian tomatoes
10 oz Frozen corn
Mince the garlic.  Trim the feathery tops from the fennel and cut the
bulb lengthwise in half; cut out the core and coarsely chop the
fennel into 1" pieces.  Peel and slice the carrots 1/2" thick.  Heat
the olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat.  Add the garlic,
fennel, and carrots and saute until the vegetables are hot and
sizzling, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the water, cover and simmer over low
heat until the vegetables are barely tender, about 5 minutes.  Add
the tomatoes with their juices and break them up with a wooden spoon.
Add the corn and kidney beans.  Bring the liquid to a boil over
medium heat. Add the marjoram and salt and pepper to taste.  Reduce
the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the flavors come together,
about 30 minutes.  Stir the macaroni and frozen spinach into the soup
and simmer until the pasta is tender, about 10 minutes more.  Remove
the soup from the heat, stir in the parmesan and adjust the
seasoning.  Serve hot.
