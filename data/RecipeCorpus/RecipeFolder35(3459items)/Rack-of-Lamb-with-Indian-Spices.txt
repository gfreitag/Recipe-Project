Title: Rack of Lamb with Indian Spices
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Low cal/fat
Yield: 2 servings
2 ts Turmeric
2 ts Paprika
2 ts Ground cumin seeds
2 ts Ground coriander seeds
1 ts Salt or to taste
Black pepper
-and cayenne pepper
1    Lemon cut into wedges
-for garnish
1    8-rib rack of lamb
1 sm Onion(s)
3    Garlic clove(s)
-minced (1 tbs)
1 tb Ginger, minced
1/4 c  Cilantro, finely chopped
-plus 1/4 cup for garnish
1 c  Non-fat yogurt
3 tb Lemon juice
Trim as much of the exterior fat off the rack as possible and scrape
the ribs clean. (Better yet, have your butcher do it.) Combine the
remaining ingredient, except the cilantro and lemon for garnish, into
a large bowl. Whisk to a smooth paste. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Marinate the lamb for 8-24 hours (the longer the better), turning 3-4
times.

Preheat the grill. Grill the lamb over medium-high heat, basting with
the marinade for 4-6 minutes per side for medium-rate, or until
cooked to taste. The lamb can also be roasted in a 400Ã¸F oven for
15-20 minutes.

To serve, carve the lamb into chops. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve
with lemon wedges.

Note: A more economical version of this dish could be made with lamb
chops.
