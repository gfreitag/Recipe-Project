Title: Ravine Brownies
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Chopped Nuts
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
1/2 c  Butter
1 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
Melt chocolate and butter together.  Cool thoroughly.  Add sugar,
eggs, flour, vanilla and nuts.  Beat well.  Spread evenly in greased
pan (8x8 inches).  Bake in 350F oven for 15 to 20 minute, or until
done. Test with a toothpick; if tester comes out sticky -- but not
doughy -- brownies are done.  They will be soft and chewy.
