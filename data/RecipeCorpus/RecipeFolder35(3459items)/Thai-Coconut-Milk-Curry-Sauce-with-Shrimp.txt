If using the coconut, scatter it in a pie tin or baking pan and bake
in a 350Ã¸F oven, stirring often, until golden, 6-8 minutes. Pour into
a small bowl and set aside.

Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pan. Stir in the pasta
with 1 tsp salt, if desired. Boil uncovered until tender, about 12
minutes. Drain.

In a small bowl, combine the coconut milk, fish sauce, brown sugar,
and cornstarch; set aside. In another bowl, combine the basil, mint
and green onion; set aside.

Heat the oil in a wok or large fry pan over high heat. Add the ginger
and curry paste and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the
coconut milk mixture and bring to boil. Add the shrimp and peanuts
and simmer until the shrimp is opaque in the center, about 3 minutes.
Set aside 3 tbs of the basil mixture; gently stir the rest into the
sauce along with the lime juice.

Put the pasta in a large serving bowl. Pour the seafood and sauce
over the pasta and gently toss to coat. Sprinkle with the roasted
coconut and reserved basil mixture and serve.
