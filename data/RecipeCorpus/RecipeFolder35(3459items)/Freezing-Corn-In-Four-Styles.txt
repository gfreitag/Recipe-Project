WHOLE KERNEL CORN 1. Choose well developed ears with plump, tender
kernels and thin, sweet milk. Press a kernel with a thumbnail to
check the milk. Corn must be fresh to freeze.

2. Husk, remove the silk, and trim the ends. Sort by size.

3. Blanch small ears (1-1/2 inches or less in diameter) 1 minute;
medium ears (2 inches or in diameter) 8 minutes; large ears (more
than 2 inches in diameter) 10 minutes. Cool; drain well.

4. Cut kernels from the cob at 2/3 the depth of the kernel.

5. Tray freeze or pack in containers, leaving 1/4 inch head space.
Seal, label, and freeze.

6. Cook frozen corn 3 to 4 minutes.

CREAM STYLE CORN 1. Prepare as for whole kernel corn, but cut the
kernels from the cob at 1/2 the depth of the kernel. Then scrape the
cob with the back of a knife to remove the milk and heart of the
kernel.

2. Pack with liquid in containers as for whole kernel corn. Seal,
label, and freeze.

3. Cook as for whole kernel corn.

PRECOOKED CORN 1. Choose, husk, and sort corn. Don't blanch.

2. Cut corn from cob as for cream style corn.

3. Heat corn with about 1/4 cup water for each pint of corn over low
heat, stirring frequently, just until thick.

4. Pour hot corn into another pan and set pan into ice water to
cool. Stir frequently to hurry cooling.

5. Pack in containers, leaving 1/4 inch head space. Seal, label, and
freeze.

6. Cook just until heated to serving temperature. Note: Don't cook
more than 3 quarts of corn at one time.

CORN ON THE COB 1. Choose corn and prepare as for whole kernel corn.

2. Blanch small ears (1-1/2 inches or less in diameter) 6 minutes;
medium ears (2 inches in diameter) 8 minutes; large ears (more than 2
inches) 10 minutes. Cool thoroughly; drain well.

3. Pack in containers or wrap ears individually or in family size
amounts in freezer paper, plastic wrap, or foil, then in plastic
freezer bags. Seal, label, and freeze.

4. Thaw frozen corn on the cob before cooking, then cook about 4
minutes.
