Combine the egg whites, egg, milk, 6 tbs herbs, salt, pepper, and
nutmeg in a large bowl and whisk until smooth. Sift in the flour. Mix
with a wooden spoon to obtain a loose, sticky batter (the consistency
of apple sauce). If it's too thin, add a little flour.

Bring a t least 2 quarts water to a rolling boil in a large, deep
saucepan. Add 1 tsp salt. Place a spaetzle maker over the pan, load
it with dough, and cut tiny droplets into the water. Cook for 1
minute, or until the water returns to a boil and the spaetzle rise to
the surface. Remove the spaetzle with a skimmer or slotted spoon and
transfer to a colander to drain. Continue cooking the spaetzle this
way until all the batter is used up.

Transfer the spaetzle to a bowl and toss with olive oil. Sprinkle
with the remaining herbs and serve at once.
