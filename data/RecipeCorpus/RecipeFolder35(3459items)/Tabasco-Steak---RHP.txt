Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Meats
Yield: 10 servings
2 cl To 4 cloves garlic; peeled
-and crushed
1/2 c  (1 stick) butter
5 lb 3-1/2" thick sirloin butt
-beefsteak
2 sm Bottles Tabasco Brand Pepper
-Sauce (or to taste)
Place the piece of beef in a plastic zip-lock bag with the
contents of 2 bottles of Tabasco Sauce.  Soak the beef in the sauce
in the refrigerator for 3 days; turn often.
Remove the beef from the sauce and cook over mesquite wood coals.
When the coals are at the hottest stage, put the steak on the grill 2
inches above the fire.  Care must be taken to prevent flame-ups
during cooking. Cook for 10 minutes, turn and cook on the other side
for 10 minutes; repeat for two more 10-minute periods.  While the
meat is cooking, blend the garlic with the softened butter and
slightly melt.
After the meat has cooked for 40 minutes, remove from the fire and
place on a cutting board; allow to rest for 10 minutes before carving.
After carving, brush the slices with the garlic butter.  The meat will
have a tangy crust but is not pungent in spite of the Tabasco.
