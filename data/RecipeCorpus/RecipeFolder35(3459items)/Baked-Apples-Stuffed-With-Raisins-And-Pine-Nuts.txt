MELE AL FORNO CON UVETTA E PIGNOLI - The raisins and pine nuts give
these baked apples an Italian flavor. Serve them warm at the end of a
hearty midwinter meal.

1. Preheat the oven to 350-F.

2. Using an apple or zucchini corer, cut out the cores and seeds from
the apples. Peel the skin from around the tops and bottoms. Arrange
the apples in a glass or ceramic baking dish. Combine the pine nuts,
walnuts, raisins, and sugar in a food processor fitted with the steel
blade. Pulse the machine on and off a few times so that the mixture
is coarsely chopped. Using a teaspoon, fill the cavities of the
apples with the nut mixture from both the top and bottom ends and
gently press the mixture to pack it firmly. Leave a little of the
filling spilling out of the apple tops.

3. Pour the apple cider into the baking pan. Bake the apples for 1
hour. Serve warm or at room temperature. These can be refrigerated
and reheated before serving.

Makes 6 servings.
