Categories: Meats
Yield: 2 1/2 cups
1/2 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Capers; or more
Salt and fresh ground pepper
3 tb Bacon fat; or butter
3 tb Flour

Most caper sauces are mayonnaise based and destined for fish dishes.
This on is good with tongue and beef:

Melt bacon fat in a saucepan and add flour; stirring with a whisk
until blended. Bring the broth to a boil separately and add all at
once whisking vigorously. Cook until thickened. Add the cream, salt,
pepper, and capers. Reheat gently before serving without boiling or
the cream will curdle.
