cut into strips 1 small onion, chopped fine 1 clove garlic, minced X
celery (approx. 2 times the volume of onion) X cooking spray X
parsley (small handful, chopped). 2 loaves dry bread cubes (cube and
toast in oven until very dry) 3 cups defatted chicken, turkey or
vegetable stock X small handful parmesan cheese (or whatever your fat
intake can bear) 1 tsp. dry sage (or 1 T fresh) X dash of nutmeg X
salt and freshly-ground black pepper to taste Saute the onion,
celery, and the lunch meat in cooking spray until the onion is clear,
not brown. Remove from heat. In a separate container, gradually add
broth to very dry bread crumbs, until moist but not soaked (don't add
all at once). Combine all ingredients, and bake inside the bird, or
in an uncovered glass casserole until heated through and crisp on
top. From: anitaepler@eworld.com - AnitaEpler at eWorld
