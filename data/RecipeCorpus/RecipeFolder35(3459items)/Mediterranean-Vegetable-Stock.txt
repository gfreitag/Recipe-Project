1. Tie the bay leaves, thyme, and peppercorns in a piece of
cheesecloth or wrap them in a piece of foil and pierce all over with
a fork.

2. Combine the onion, leek, garlic, celery, carrots, bell pepper,
fennel, tomatoes, basil, parsley, zest, vermouth, juice, saffron, and
water in a large stockpot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and
simmer uncovered for 1 hour, or until the vegetables are very tender,
adding water as necessary to keep the vegetables covered.

3. Strain the stock, pressing with the back of a spoon to extract as
much liquid as possible from the vegetables. Let the stock cool to
room temperature, then refrigerate or freeze. Refrigerated stock will
keep 3-4 days; frozen, it will keep for 6 months. For a thicker,
richer stock, remove the bouquet garni and orange peel and pure the
liquid and vegetables, then strain.

Note: Use the stock for dishes of Spanish, Italian, Provencal, and
North African origin. Or to make a wonderful Mediterranean Vegetable
Soup, discard the bouquet garni and pure the stock and vegetables in
a blender. Season with salt and pepper and serve.

Makes 8 cups soup.
