the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Cut or process in the
butter until the mixture resembles small corn niblets. Add the milk
and mix quickly.

Roll out dough onto a flowered surface to a 12 x 10 inch rectangle
Spread the dough with the softened butter, and arrange the rhubarb on
top. Sprinkle sugar all over, and dust liberally with cinnamon. Roll

seam side down. Cut the roll into 12 slices. Arrange cut side up on
an oiled 3 qt. flat glass baking dish.

Poor cooled sauce over the top. Bake for 35 minutes, until the
dumplings are puffy and golden brown. Serve with cream if desired.

NOTE: Frozen rhubarb can be used. Do not thaw before arranging on
dough. Cook the same length of time.
