Title: HOMEMADE KAHLUA II
Categories: Beverages, Alcohol
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
3 c  Good Vodka
6 ts Vanilla extract
3 c  Sugar
12 ts Really good instant coffee
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
1 c  Any Brandy
3 c  Water
2 tb Fresh coarsely ground coffee
Mix first 4 ingredients and simmer them for 1.5-2 hours with
occasional stirring. Cool. Add the rest of the stuff. Filter and pour
into dark bottles. I use a metal mesh to keep out the coffee grounds.
Keep the bottles in a cool, dark place for 3 months (YOU HEARD IT
RIGHT!). Shake every day. (The bottles, I mean).
