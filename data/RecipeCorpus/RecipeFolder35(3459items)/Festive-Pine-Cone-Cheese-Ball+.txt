Combine everything but the almonds thoroughly. Shape and place on a
rather large platter forming the shape of a pine cone (flat against
the platter.) place in fridg to chill for about a half an hour. Stud
cheese with almonds to cover it. Try to do it in rows to resemble a
pine cone.

Put back in fridg till serving time. Just before serving, place a few
small pine branches around the cheese ball. Really festive and a show
stopper.

Serve with crackers.

Got this recipe from a friend who is a chef and a teacher at our local
cooking school "Cooks' of Crocus Hill" - B.J. Carpenter B.J. brought
this to a Christmas party and I weedled the recipe out of her.
