Title: Rosettes (deep-fried cookies; Pizzelle/Rosette Iron)
Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 18 cookies
1/2 c  Water or Milk
1/2 c  Flour *see note
Oil for deep-frying
Powdered Sugar for dusting
1    Egg
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Vegetable oil
Heat oil (2-3") in small, deep saucepan to 400 degrees.  In
small deep bowl, beat egg, sugar and salt.  Beat in 1 Tb. oil, the
water or milk (milk makes a richer cookie), and flour until smooth.
Heat rosette iron by placing in hot oil 1 minute.  Tap excess
oil from iron on paper towels; dip hot iron into batter just to top
edge (don't go over top).  Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds.
Immediately remove rosette; invert on paper towel to cool.  (If
rosette is not crisp, stir in small amount of water or milk.)
Heat iron in hot oil and tap on paper towels before making each
rosette.  (If iron is not hot enough, batter will not stick.)  Just
before serving, sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired.

* If using self-rising flour, omit salt.

Makes 18 rosettes.
