Title: Hamilton Yellow Squash Casserole
Categories: Holiday, Vegetables, Casseroles
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Milk
Buttered Cornflake crumbs
2 lb Crookneck (yellow) squash
2 tb Butter
4 oz Shredded Cheddar cheese
2    Eggs -- beaten
This recipe is fairly rich-tasting, appropriate for Thanksgiving.
Note: the cornflake crumbs are important since their flavor
really meshes well with the squash; breadcrumbs don't work nearly as
well.

Slice squash into bite sized pieces and cook covered in a little water
about 10 min until tender. Drain thoroughly. Add the butter and
cheese and close the lid to let them melt.
Mix up eggs, sugar, salt and milk in a small bowl and stir this into
the squash. Turn everything into a greased 2 qt casserole dish, top
with the crumbs. Bake 400F 20 min or until cooked through (it will
take a lot longer if you've let it cool awhile before cooking).
