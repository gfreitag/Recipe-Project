Title: Hot Escarole With Potatoes & Garlic
Categories: Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 2 servings
1    Head escarole
2 tb Balsamic vinegar
1/8 ts Salt
Fresh ground pepper
1 1/2 lb New potatoes
2    Cloves garlic
1/2    Jalapeno pepper
1 tb Olive oil
Scrub but do not peel the potatoes.  Cover with water and bring to a
boil; cook potatoes about 20 minutes, until tender.  Slice the garlic
and mince the jalapeno for about 30 seconds.  Remove the tough stems
and any spoiled leaves from the escarole.  Wash and dry.  Trim off
the bottom; cut the leaves in half crosswise and add to the garlic.
Cook over medium heat just a few minutes, stirring occasionally to
wilt leaves completely.  When the potatoes are cooked, cut into
bite-size pieces and stir into the escarole along with the vinegar.
Season with salt and pepper.
