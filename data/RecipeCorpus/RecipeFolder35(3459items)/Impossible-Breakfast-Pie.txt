Title: Impossible Breakfast Pie
Categories: Breakfast, Meats, Cheese/eggs, Pie/tart
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Oregano leaves
1 lb Sausage
1 c  Cheese, cheddar, shredded
6    Eggs
2 c  Milk
1 ts Dry mustard
1 c  Bisquick
Brown and drain sausage. Mix all ingredients together and cover.
Refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 350.  Pour into greased 2-qt. casserole; bake until
knife inserted in center comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Sylvia's comments: This rose so much, it was about 1" over the top of
the casserole!  2 adults and 2 children almost polished the whole
thing off. Easy to make and flavorful, although the hour cooking time
(50 minutes worked in my oven) limits it to weekends for us; I don't
get up an hour before breakfast on weekdays. But for a special
weekend breakfast, it's great.  I'd also like to try it split, 2
servings to a foil pie pan; I bet it would take less baking time that
way.
