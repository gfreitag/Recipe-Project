This is another recipe I got in the States, probably from a
supermarket or other (and no, I didn't go shopping on holiday!) but I
can't remember which one. The recipe card is headed Goodings Words
Worth Eating btw.

Preheat the oven to 325. Cut 14 small slits into fat on the lamb.
Insert slivers of garlic. Combine pepper, garlic salt and dry
mustard. Rub over meat surface. Place lamb in flat baking pan. Top
with orange peel. Bake uncovered for 30-35 minutes per pound or until
a meat thermometer reaches 175. Prepare glaze while lamb is baking;
combine 4 glaze ingredients and heat for 3-5 minutes. Spoon glaze
over lamb during last 30 minutes of baking time. Remove lamb from the
oven, allow to sit in pan for 10-15 minutes. Baste with pan juices.
Transfer to a serving platter. Garnish platter with orange slices
centred with a teaspoon of mint jelly.

Serve with new potatoes and fresh peas or fresh asparagus. This glaze
is also delicious on broiled lamb chops.
