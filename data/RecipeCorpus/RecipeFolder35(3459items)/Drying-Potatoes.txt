OVEN DRYING, The Best Way To Dry Foods; by Irene Crowe ISBN
0-8362-0664-9. Riced Potatoes: Boil potatoes in their jackets until
done. Cool, then peel and place into ricer or striner. Do not attempt
to process them unless they are cold, as they will form a gummy mess.
Directions continue for oven drying, but I think we can use our
gadget, since this book is dated 1976 BD (before dehydrators). When
dry, store in airtight containers. Drying time: 4-6 hours in oven.

To reconstitute riced potatoes, merely drop into boiling water. Use
from 4 1/2 to 5 cups of water for 1 cup riced potatoes. Stir
constantly for 15 mins. Shared by: Dan Klepach
