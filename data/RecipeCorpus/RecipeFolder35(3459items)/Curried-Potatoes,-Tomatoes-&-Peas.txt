Title: Curried Potatoes, Tomatoes & Peas
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 servings
1 ts Ground coriander
1 lb Tomatoes -- garden fresh
10 oz Frozen peas
1/8 ts Salt
Fresh ground pepper
1 1/2 c  Plain yogurt
1 lb New potatoes
1 lg Onion -- chopped
1/2    Jalapeno pepper
1 tb Canola oil
1/4 ts Ground turmeric
1 ts Ground cumin
1/2 ts Ground ginger
Scrub but do not peel the potatoes and place them in a pot with water
to cover.  Cover and boil about 17 minutes, or until tender.  Chop
the onion and mince the jalapeno.  Heat the oil in a large nonstick
skillet; add the onion and jalapeno along with the spices and saute
until the onion begins to brown.  Coarsely cube the tomatoes and add
to the skillet along with the peas; cook just until the peas are
heated through and the tomatoes have given up their juices.  When the
potatoes are cooked, drain them and cut into halves or quarters.  Add
them to the vegetables.  Season with salt and pepper.  Stir to coat,
and serve with yogurt on the side.
