Title: Mrs. Mary Randolph's Braised Wild Duck
Categories: Main dish, Game, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Honey or brown sugar
1/2 ea Lemon peel; grated
1 ea Bouquet "sweet herbs" (bay,
-chervil, parsley, tarragon,
-or rosemary)
1/2 ts Cornstarch, dissolved in->
1 tb Water (optional)
Croutons (optional)
4 ea Wild ducks; with giblets
Salt and pepper
1 ts Powdered cloves
8 ea Shallots (or scallion or
-onion equivalent)
4 sl Bacon (or butter)
1/2 c  Wine
1/3 c  Vinegar
While simmering duck giblets and necks in 1-1/2 cups water, rub the
insides of the ducks with salt, pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon cloves each.
Place in the cavity of each bird its own giblets, two peeled
shallots, and a tablespoon of butter.  Cover each bird's breast with
butter (or with a strip of bacon held in place with wooden
toothpicks) and sew up cavity.
Place fowls in casserole dish, preferably one that will just hold
them snugly, and add the remainder of the ingredients (except for the
cornstarch and the croutons).  Put in 500 degree oven for 15 minutes,
uncovered, then turn down heat to 300 degrees and continue braising
(now covered) for about 25 minutes more.
Baste occasionally (half broth, half wine) and each time you baste
press the herb bouquet with bowl of spoon to release herb essence.
You may thicken the pan juices, after the birds are removed, with
cornstarch dissolved in water.
Near the end of the braising you may wish to fry 2 to 3 pieces of
bread in bacon fat, or in garlic butter, cube into croutons, and
place a few on top of the sauce in the boat and the remainder in a
bowl beside the sauceboat.
