Title: Ha'penny Friendship Bread-Pg. 3 (Medieval)
Categories: Breads, Medieval
Yield: 2 servings
*****  NONE  *****
TO DECORATE: Make small 1/2" slit in top crust of each loaf; insert
shinny copper penny. Tie loaves with ribbon and decorate with small
sheaf of wheat or other grain, dried flowers, silk flours or dried
berries. Attach friendship note which will follow on last note.

TO PRESERVE BREAD: Allow loaves to dry in cool dry place for several
days until VERY HARD. Spray or brush clear, glossy polyurethane or
spray clear, glossy resin around loaf. Let dry; repeat with second
coat. When dry, decorate as desired.

TIP: Loaves may be brushed with mixture of 1 egg white and 1 tbsp.
water before baking. If desired, sprinkle with sesame or poppy seed.

For crusty topped loaves, set small pan of water in oven while bread
is baking.
