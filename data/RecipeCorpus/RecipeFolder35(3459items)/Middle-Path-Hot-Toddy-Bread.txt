3 c  Warm Water

In a large mixing bowl, combine water, yeast, ginger, honey and
molasses. Set aside and allow to soften until bubbly. When ready, add
whole wheat flour, potatoes and nut mixture. Add enough unbleached
flour to make a stiff dough. Sprinkle 1 cup of unbleached flour on a
bread board or pastry cloth and turn dough onto it. Knead until dough
is smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, turning to coat the
top. Cover the bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place (85 F)
until double in bulk (about 1 hour). Punch down dough to original
size. Divide into half and shape into 2 loaves. Place in 9 x 5 x 3
greased loaf pans. Let rise again until double (about 1 hour). Bake
in a preheated 375 F oven for 45 mins. If desired, dough may be
divided into thirds and baked in three 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 pans. Makes 2
large loaves.
