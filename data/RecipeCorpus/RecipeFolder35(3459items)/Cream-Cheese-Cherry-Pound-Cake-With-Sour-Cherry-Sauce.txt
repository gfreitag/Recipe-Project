1. To make the topping, place butter, sugar, flour, salt, and nutmeg
in a bowl and rub between your fingers until mixture resembles coarse
meal. Set aside. 2. To make the cake, preheat the oven to 350 F.
Butter and flour a 9-inch tube pan. 3. Put the dried cherries in a
bowl and pour boiling water over them. Let stand for 5 mins. Drain.
4. Using an electric mixer, cream the butter, cream cheese, and sugar
until light and fluffy, stopping to scrape the bowl from time to
time. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Mix in the vanilla. 5. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and
salt. Add to the butter mixture in thirds. Gently stir in the milk
and the cherries. Scrape the batter into the pan and top with the
crumb mixture. Bake until a skewer inserted into the center of the
cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Place on a rack to cool for 15
mins. Turn the cake out of the pan, invert, and let it cool
completely. 6. To make the sauce, combine the cherries, sugar, and
cinnamon in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Simmer, stirring
occasionally, for 10 mins. Stir in the vinegar. Stir in the
cornstarch mixture and cook until the sauce begins to thicken, about
2 mins longer. Strain. To serve, cut the cake into slices, place on
plates, and spoon a little of the sauce around each slice. Serves
about 10.
