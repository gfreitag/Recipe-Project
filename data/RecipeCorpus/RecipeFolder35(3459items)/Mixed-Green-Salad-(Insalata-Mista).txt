This is probably the most common salad found in Italy. The greens
should always be crisp and fresh, and well rinsed in several changes
of cold water to be sure no dirt or grit is left on the leaves, then
patted or spun dry. Just as important is the dressing, which is a
delicate combination of mostly olive oil with just a hint of vinegar
or lemon juice and salt as seasoning. The dressing should wet- never
drown- the greens.

8 cups greens (combination of redleaf, Boston, or romaine lettuce,
curly-leaf chicory, radicchio, and arugula), stems removed and torn
into bite-size pieces 1 scallion, white and green parts, finely
chopped Salt to taste 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon
red wine vinegar

1. Combine the greens and scallion in a serving bowl. Refrigerate,
uncovered, until ready to serve.

2. Just before serving, season the salad with salt. Pour the olive
oil and then the vinegar over the lettuce. Toss well and serve.
