Title: Generic Muffins and Variations - Part 1
Categories: Breads, Muffins
Yield: 24 small muff
1    Or 2 eggs [4]
2 tb To 4 T melted butter [5]
3/4 c  Milk [6]
2 c  Cake Flour [1]
1/2 ts To 1 tsp salt
2 tb To 4 T Sugar [2]
2 ts Baking powder [3]
Sift flour and measure it. Resift with salt, baking powder and sugar.
Beat the eggs in a separate bowl; add and mix the butter and milk. To
mix add the optional ingredients to the flour mixture and then beat
in the liquid ingredients to the dry ones with a few swift strokes...
a minimum of strokes; ignore the last few lumps so as not to develop
and toughen the wheat gluten.

To bake fill a well greased [ or use cooking spray or teflon if you
are seeking low fat recipes ] or cup-cake paper lined muffin pan
about 2/3 full with water in any empty wells so to protect the pan
and moisten the muffins while baking. Bake at once in a pre-heated
400 deg oven for 20-25 min. Let muffins cool slightly before removing
from pan. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   10-19-95
