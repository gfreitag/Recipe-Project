Title: Lemon Omelet with Papaya
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Breakfast, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 ea Papaya, seeded and sliced
Watercress sprigs (garnish)
2 ea Eggs
1 ts Honey
1/2 ts Grated lemon rind
(My note: I would use 1 whole egg and 1 egg white.) Beat eggs with
honey, lemon rind and vanilla until well combined. Pour egg mixture
in an omelet pan or skillet coated with no-stick spray. Cook over
medium heat, pulling the edges of the omelet toward the center of the
pan and swirling the pan to allow uncooked egg to reach the edge.
When the eggs are cooked and just set on top, remove from heat.  Lay
two slices of papaya down the center of the omelt, fold the omelet
over the papaya and slide omelet onto a plate. Garnish with
additional papaya slices and watercress. From: The Lose Weight
