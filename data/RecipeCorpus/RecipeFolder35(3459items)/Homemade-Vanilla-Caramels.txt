Title: Homemade Vanilla Caramels
Categories: Candies, Tasteofhome, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 c  Light cream, divided
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  White sugar
2/3 c  Corn syrup (clear white)
Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and 1/2 cup cream in a heavy saucepan.
Cooking over low heat, stirring constantly, heat through until sugar
crystals dissolve.  Add the vanilla and increase heat until a nice
low boil is obtained. Stirring constantly, continue to cook until
soft ball stage is reached, and slowly add 1/2 cup cream.  Continue
to cook until cream is absorbed and then slowly add remaining 1/2 cup
of cream. Continue to cook until 238-240F on candy thermometer is
obtained. Remove from heat. Carefully scrape hot caramel mixture into
a greased pan and cover with clean towel.  Allow to sit until almost
completely cool and set. Using a sharp knife run under hot water (and
keeping water flowing to run knife under while cutting) slowly cut
into squares. Allow to sit until completely cool.  Wrap individual
squares with plastic wrap or wax paper, twisting the tops closed.
Can then be stored in a large plastic sealable bag. Origin: Sharon
