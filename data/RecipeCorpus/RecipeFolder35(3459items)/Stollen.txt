Put all ingredients except the fruits and almonds in the machine's
bread pan. Turn the machine on the RISE setting so that the machine
will mix, knead, and allow the dough to rise once. Add the fruits and
almonds after 12 mins, or when the machine signals.

After the dough has risen, turn it onto a floured surface. Shape it
into a 6 1/2 x 8-inch oval. With the side of your hand, crease the
oval down its length, just off center. Fold the smaller side over the
larger side. Place the loaf on a baking sheet coated with cooking
spray.

Cover the dough with a towel and let rise in a warm place until
doubled in size; about 1 hour. Brush the top lightly with egg white
glaze or skim milk. Bake at 350 F for about 30 mins, until the top is
golden brown and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped. This recipe
makes 16 slices.
