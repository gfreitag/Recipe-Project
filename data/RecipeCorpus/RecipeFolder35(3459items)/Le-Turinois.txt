Title: Le Turinois
Categories: Desserts, Cake/cookie, Chocolate, French
Yield: 4 servings
8 oz Dark chocolate
Vanilla essence -=OR=-
Rum -=OR=- Brandy
2 lb Chestnuts, unpeeled-=OR=-
1 1/2 lb Chestnut puree unsweetened
5 oz Castor sugar
1/2 c  Water
Peel the chestnuts. Nick a thin strip from the outside skin, and put
them into a saucepan of cold water. Bring to the boil, and remove
from heat.
Taking them out one by one, take off the hard ouside shell, and the
thin bitter inner skin. Leave any difficult one to one side, then put
them into boiling water again, and try again.
Now simmer the chestnuts in water flavoured with a vanilla pod until
really tender, but not completely falling to a mush. Drain and pass
through a fine sieve.
Cream the butter thoroughly, add the sugar by degrees and beat until
white. Break up the chocolate, and melt in a small pan with the water
stir to obtian a smooth cream. Allow to cool a little, then add to
the butter mixture with the chestnuts. Flavour to taste with vanilla
essence or rum or cognac. Lightly oil a loaf tin, and line it with
greaseproof or baking paper. Turn the mixture into the tin, smooth
over and leave to set in a cool place overnight. Nest day, turn out,
cut into slices and serve with chantilly cream and langue de chat
biscuits. A good beaten egg custard could substitute for the whipped
cream.

If you ONLY have access to sweetened chestnut puree, then reduce the
amount of sugar in the recipe appropriately. BUT be aware that the
recipe is far better if made with freshly pureed chestnuts.
