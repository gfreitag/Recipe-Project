Categories: Pasta/rice, Sausage, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese -- freshly
-grated
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Fennel seed
Black pepper -- to taste
5 tb Olive oil
4    Cloves garlic -- slivered
1 lb Italian sausage
4 c  Broccoli flowerets
12 oz Penne
Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large skillet.  Add the garlic, and saute
over medium heat until it is golden and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.
Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon.  Set it aside.  Remove 2 of
the sausages from their casing and crumble the meat.  Cut the
remaining sausages into thirds. Add all the sausage to the same
skillet, adn cook over medium heat until browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
Then cover, and simmer until cooked through, about 10 minutes.
Remove the meat with a slotted spoon and set aside. Pour off all but
2 tbsp fat.  Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
Add the broccoli and blanch it for 3 minutes.  Remove the broccoli
with a slotted spoon and drain, reserving the cooking liquid. Rinse
the broccoli under cold water, drain again and set aside.  Bring the
broccoli cooking liquid to a boil again and add the penne.  Cook at a
rolling boil until just tender.  Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the
cooking liquid. Keep the penne warm in a covered bowl on top of the
stove.  In a large saucepan, heat the sausage, broccoli, reserved 1/2
cup cooking liquid, and remaining 4 tbsp olive oil.  Place the pasta
in a heated serving bowl and add the sausage mixture.  Top with the
parmesan cheese, salt, fennel seeds and pepper.  Toss well and
sprinkle with the reserved garlic. Serve immediately with parmesan
cheese.
