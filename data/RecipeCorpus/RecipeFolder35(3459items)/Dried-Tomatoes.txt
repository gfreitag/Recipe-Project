Categories: Low cal/fat
Yield: 1 cup
3    (to 4)
-garlic clove(s), minced
1 bn Basil
2 ts (to 3 tsp)
-extra-virgin olive oil
16    Plum tomatoes or
8 lg Round tomatoes
Cooking spray
1 ts Kosher salt
-or to taste
Black pepper
1. Preheat the oven to 200øF. Wash and dry the tomatoes. If using plum
tomatoes, cut them in half lengthwise. If using round tomatoes, cut
them in half widthwise. Arrange the tomatoes on a baking sheet
sprayed with cooking spray. Generously sprinkle the tomatoes with
kosher salt, pepper, and minced garlic. Stem the basil and place one
leaf on each tomato. Lightly drizzle the tomatoes with olive oil.

2. Bake the tomatoes at 200øF. for 12-14 hours, or until shrunken,
wrinkled, and almost dry. Don't let them dry out completely or they'll
become tough, and don't let them brown.

3. Let the tomatoes cool to room temperature, then transfer to a
sterile jar. If desired, add olive oil to cover. You can use a few
drops of the intensely flavored oil on salads or steamed vegetables.
Store in the refrigerator. Without oil, they will keep for 4-5 days;
in oil they will keep for 6 months.
