lb Total)
1 c  All-Purpose Flour
1 qt (Approx) Salad Oil, for
-frying
Salt -- optional
1    Dried Ancho Chili (About 1/2
Oz)
1    Dried Calif Or New Mexico
Chili ( 1/4 Oz)
3    Red Or Yellow Onions (1 1/2
1. Stem and seed chilies; spread chilies flat in an 8- to 9-inch
square pan. Bake in a 300 F oven until just toasted, 5 to 8 mins;
watch carefully, as they burn easily. Cool. 2. In a blender, whirl
toasted chilies until finely ground; set aside. 3. Peel and thinly
slice onions; separate into rings. Place half of the flour and ground
chilies in a plastic bag, add half of the rings, and shake to coat
rings evenly with flour-chili mixture. Repeat with remaining flour,
ground chilies, and onions. 4. In a deep 5- to 6-qt pan over high
heat, bring about 1 in salad oil to 325 F on a thermometer. Add
flour-coated onions, about 1/4 of them at a time; cook, stirring
often, until onions are golden brown, about 5 mins. The temperature
of the oil will drop at first, then rise again as onions brown;
regulate heat accordingly. With a slotted spoon, remove onions and
drain on paper towels. 5. Serve warm onion rings piled in a paper
napkin-lined basket or plate; sprinkle with salt as desired. Makes
about 6 cups, 12 servings.
