Title: Apricot Crepes
Categories: Breakfast, Pcake/waffl, Fruit
Yield: 16 servings
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Butter (or marg.); melted
1 c  Jam, apricot
1 c  Walnuts; ground
Sugar, powdered
2    Eggs; beaten
1 c  Milk
1 c  Club soda
2 c  Flour, all-purpose
1/4 ts Salt
Combine eggs, milk and club soda quickly.  Add flour and salt,
stirring constantly; stir in vanilla.  Brush the bottom of a 6 or 7"
crepe pan or heavy skillet lightly with melted butter, and place pan
over medium heat until just hot, not smoking.

Pour 2 tablespoons batter in pan, and quickly tilt pan in all
directions so batter covers pan in a thin film.  Cook about 1 minute.
Lift edge of crepe to test for doneness.

The crepe is ready for flipping when it can be shaken loose from pan.
Flip the crepe and cook about 30 seconds on the other side; this is
rarely more than a spotty brown and is used as the side on which
filling is placed.

Spread jam over each crepe, and roll up; keep warm while making the
remaining crepes.  Sprinkle with walnuts and powdered sugar before
serving. Serve warm.

NOTE: Crepes can be made in advance and stacked between layer of waxed
paper or paper towels to prevent sticking.  crepes can be frozen,
filled or unfilled.  Heat them in a covered dish at 300 degrees to
thaw.
