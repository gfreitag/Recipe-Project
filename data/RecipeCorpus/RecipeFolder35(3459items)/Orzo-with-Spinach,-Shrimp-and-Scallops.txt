transfer the seafood to a bowl and cover to keep warm.

Return the water to a boil and stir in the orzo with 1 tsp salt, if
desired. Boil uncovered until tender, 8-10 minutes. Drain. Cover and
set aside if not ready to use.

Meanwhile, heat a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the pine nuts
and cook, stirring often, until golden, about 6 minutes. Pour from
the pan and set aside. Heat the oil in the pan, add the garlic and
cook until tender, about 1 minute. Add the spinach and orzo and stir
until heated through. Stir in the seafood, pine nuts and cheese.
Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
