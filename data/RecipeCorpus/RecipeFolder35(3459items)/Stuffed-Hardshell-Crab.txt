As you have noticed by now, Cajuns andd Creoles stuff
everything! Crabs are no different.  The stuffed crab is
presented in many ways on Louisiana menus, but mostly as an
entree or as part of a seafood platter.

2 pounds white or claw crabmeat
12 crab shells, cleaned
3/4 cup melted butter
2 cups chopped onions
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped bell pepper
1 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/4 cup diced garlic
salt and cracked black pepper to taste
2 cups seasoned Italian bread crumbs

Have your seafood supplier clean and package twelve hard shell crabs.
These shells will freeze well, so you may consider buying them
well in advance. In a heavy bottom saute pan, heat butter
over medium high heat. Saute onions, celery, bell peppers,
and garlic until vegetables are wilted, approximately three
to five minutes.  Add crabmeat and blend well into
vegetable mixture. Continue to cook until juices are
rendered from vegetables and crabmeat. Season to taste
using salt and pepper.  Remove from heat and sprinkle in
bread crumbs, a little at a time, until proper consistency
is achieved. Stuffing should not be too dry.  Adjust
seasonings if necessary.  Place an equal amount of stuffing
in each crab shell and continue until all stuffing is used.
Additional bread crumbs may  be sprinkled on top of stuffed
crab. Allow to cool and wrap individually for the freezer
or drizzle with a small amount of melted butter and bake at
350 degrees F, approximately fifteen to twenty minutes.
