====================
[Makes 6 to 8 servings]

1/3 c  Sunflower oil
2 tb Ice water
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon

3) Press the dough firmly into a ball. Then place it between two
sheets of plastic wrap. Roll, from the centre outwards, to 1/8" (3
mm) thickness. Fit the pastry loosely into a 9" (23 cm) lightly oiled
pie plate. Bake for 10 minutes. 4) Thoroughly combine all of the
filling ingredients with an electric mixer or food processor. Pour
the filling into the pie shell. 5) Bake at 350F (180C) for 30 to 40
minutes. A tooth pick inserted halfway between the centre and the
outside edge should come out clean when the pie is completely cooked.
6) Allow to cool before serving. ** Variations ** Add 1 teaspoon
freshly grated orange rind. Add 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves. Mix in by
hand, 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans. Note: To cook pumpkin or
squash: cut in quarters; remove seeds; bake at 350F (180C) for about
30 to 45 minutes. Contributed by: Walter Brown, ab684
