Title: Pasta With Roasted Garlic Sauce
Categories: Pasta/rice
Yield: 8 servings
16 oz Fusilli
Salt
Fresh ground pepper
2 lg Garlic bulbs
1 1/2 c  Chicken or vegetable broth
1/2 c  Sour cream
1/4 c  Heavy cream
To roast garlic preheat oven to 450.  Peel outer skin from garlic
bulb. Keeping the bulb intact, cut a small slice off the top.
Separate unpeeled cloves and place them in a pie dish.  Spray with
Pam.  Bake, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes or until soft when
squeezed.  When cool enough to handle, remove peel and chop coarsely.
In a 4 cup microwave measure combine garlic, broth, sour cream, heavy
cream and salt and pepper. (Sauce may be refrigerated overnight.)
Shortly before serving bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Cook pasta according to package

directions. Microwave sauce, covered with plastic wrap, on high for 2
to 4 minutes, or until hot.  Drain pasta, return to saucepan and toss
well with sauce.  If too dry, add more broth or cream.  Season with
salt and pepper to taste.  Serve immediately.
