Title: Hummus bi Tahina (Cold Chick-Pea and Garlic Puree)
Categories: Middle east, Dips/spread
Yield: 2 cups
2 ts Salt
3 md Garlic Cloves, peeled and
-finely chopped
1/4 c  Lemon juice, fresh
1 c  Tatatoor sauce
1 1/3 c  Garbanzos, dried
OR
2 c  Canned garbanzos, drained,
-rinsed,
PLUS
1/2 c  To 2 cups cold water
Instructions:

If your are using dried garbanzos (chick-peas), start a day ahead.
Wash the peas in a sieve under cold running water, then place them in
a large bowl or pan and add enough cold water to cover them by 2
inches. Soak at room temperature for at least 12 hours.  Drain the
peas and place them in a heavy 2 to 3 quart saucepan.  Add the salt
and enough fresh water to cover the peas completely.  Bring to a boil
over high heat, reduce the heat to low and simmer partially covered
for about 2 to 3 hours until the peas are very tender.  Replenish the
liquid with boiling water from time to time to keep the peas covered
throughout the cooking period. Drain the peas and reserve the cooking
liquid. In a small bowl, mash the garlic to a paste with a pestle or
the back of a spoon. Add the peas and 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking
liquid or water, and mash vigorously to a smooth puree.
(Alternatively, mash the garlic with a pestle or the back of a spoon,
then force the garlic, peas and 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid or
water through a fine sieve or a food mill set over a bowl.) With a
large spoon, beat in the lemon juice, a few tablespoons at a time.
Beating constantly, pour in the taratoor in a slow thin stream and
continue to beat until the mixture is smooth.  Hummus should be thin
enough to spread easily; if necessary, add up to 1/2 cup more of the
chick-pea cooking liquid or water, beating it in a tablespoon at a
time. To serve, spread the hummus on a plate, or spoon it into a bowl.
