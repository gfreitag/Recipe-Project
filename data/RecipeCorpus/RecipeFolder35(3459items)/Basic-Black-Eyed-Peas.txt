Title: Basic Black-Eyed Peas
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 2 cups
1    Branch of sage
-with 3-4 leaves or
1/2 ts Dried sage
Salt and pepper to taste
1 c  Dried black-eyed peas
3 c  Vegetable or other stock
1    Bay leaf
5    (or 6) parsley sprigs
1. Although it's not necessary to soak black-eyed peas, you can if
you have the time. If so, wash and drain them, then place them in a
bowl with water to cover by 4-inches. Let soak for 2-4 hours.

2. Drain the beans and combine with the stock in a large pot over high
heat. Bring to a simmer, then add the bay leaf. Lay the sprigs of
parsley and sage across the top of the beans. Partially cover and
simmer until the beans are tender, about 45 minutes. (Increase the
cooking time to 1 hour or more if the beans were not soaked.)

3. Remove the bay leaf, parsley, and sage. Add salt and pepper if the
beans are to be eaten without further preparation. Serve hot.

Can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.
