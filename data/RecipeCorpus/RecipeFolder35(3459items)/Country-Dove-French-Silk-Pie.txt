Combine crust ingredients and blend well. Pat thin layer of mixture
into bottom and sides of a 10-inch pie pan. Bake in preheated 350 F
oven for 20 mins. Allow to cool.

Cream butter and sugar thoroughly. Blend in vanilla and chocolate and
mix well. Add eggs one at a time, beating with mixer on high speed
for at least 5 mins after each addition. Pour mixture into a pie
shell and chill in refrigerator for several hours or overnight. The
crust and filling freeze well at this stage if making the pie ahead
of time.

Whip cream to soft peak stage. Add sugar and vanilla and continue to
whip until cream stands in firm peaks. Spread over pie and grate
sweetened chocolate on top.

Makes 8 servings.
