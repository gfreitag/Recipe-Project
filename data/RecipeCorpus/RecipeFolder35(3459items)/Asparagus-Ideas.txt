1. Garnish cooked asparagus with pimento bits and/or salted mushrooms.

2. Top with crumbled bacon bits (incidentally, these are usually made
of soya and are vegetarian - but check first!), grated or slices of
cooked egg.

3. Combine asparagus with small new potatoes, slices of celery or
water chestnuts.

4. Serve cooked asparagus in a light French dressing for a salad.
