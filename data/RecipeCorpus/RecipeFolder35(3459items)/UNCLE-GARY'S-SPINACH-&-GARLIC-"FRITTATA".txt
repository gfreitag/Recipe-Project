Title: UNCLE GARY'S SPINACH & GARLIC "FRITTATA"
Categories: Pie/tart, Vegetables
Yield: 1 pie
1/2 c  Romano; grated
1/4 c  Parmesan; grated
50 oz Spinach, frozen; cooked 3/4
-of the way
1 ts Pepper
2    Garlic bulbs; peeled &
-minced
1/4 c  Olive oil
2    Eggs; slightly beaten
1/2 c  Bread crumbs, fresh
Cool the cooked spinach - then place it in the center of a clean
towel. Twist the towel to drain ALL the water.  This is so very
important. Next, remove the spinach from the towel, place on a
cutting board and chop up well.

Move the chopped spinach to a big bowl, add the minced garlic, eggs,
oil, both cheeses, pepper, and mix with your hands. Then add the
bread crumbs and complete mixing.

In the meantime, heat your oven to 425.   Grease an 8 or 9" cake tin
and coat it lightly with olive oil.

Place the spinach mixture in the cake tin - pat it down to remove all
the air bubbles.  We also want to compact this dish.  (Use a butter
knife - smooth it out evenly) Bake 40 minutes at 425.  Remove.  Cut
around edges.

When cooled, remove it from the cake tin and place it on several
layers of absorbent towels for about 20 minutes. Flip it over and
repeat. Finally, place it on a dinner plate, let cool completely to
room temperature.
