Title: Spiced Salt (Adapted From Vong, Manhattan)
Categories: Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Cloves
2 ts Cumin Seed -- optional
1 ts Celery Seed -- optional
1/2 c  Kosher Salt
2 tb (Heap) Star Anise
2    Cinnamon Sticks -- broken in
Pieces
3 tb Sichuan Peppercorns
Grind the star anise, cinnamon stocks, peppercorn, cloves, and cumin
seed, if using separately in a spice grinder. If using celery seed,
leave whole. Combine the spices and salt in a bowl and mix
thoroughly. Store in an airtight container. This Thai-spiced salt is
used in place of table salt at Vong Restaurant. It is particularly
good with chicken or fish steaks or fillets. Try rubbing it on an
hour before grilling. It can be left on for a spicy seasoned crust.
It is also great for adding zing to cold rice, pasta salads, or even
grilled vegetables. Makes 1 cup.
