Categories: Desserts, Pie/tart
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
6 tb Unsalted butter -- melted
1 1/2 c  Graham cracker crumbs
2 tb Sugar
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
pn Salt
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
2 tb Unsalted butter
3/4 c  Dark brown sugar
1/3 c  Cornstarch
3 c  Milk
4 lg Egg yolks
MMMMM-------------------WHIPPED CREAM TOPPING------------------------
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
2/3 c  Heavy cream -- well chilled
1 tb Powdered sugar
Preheat the oven to 350.  In a bowl, combine the graham cracker
crumbs, sugar, and butter; toss to moisten the crumbs.  Press evenly
into a buttered 10" pie pan, reaching up to but not over the rim.
Bake for 10 minutes.  Cool the crust completely on a wire rack.
Meanwhile, stir together the 1/2 cup of the brown sugar and the
cornstarch in a bowl. Stir in 1/4 cup of the milk and the egg yolks;
set aside.  Bring the remaining 2 3/4 cups milk, the remaining 1/4
cup brown sugar and the salt to a boil in a saucepan over medium
heat.  When the milk is boiling, add a splash to the egg yolk mixture
in the bowl and whisk well.  Repeat the process 2 to 3 times.  Scrape
the mixture into the saucepan and bring to a boil, whisking
constantly.  Be sure to whisk around the edges of the pan. Boil,
whisking, for 2 minutes.  Strain the custard into a clean bowl. Whisk
in the vanilla and butter until smooth.  Place a sheet of wax paper
or plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard to prevent
skin forming; refrigerate until cooled, about 2 hours.  Pour the
cooled custard into the crust. Top with wax paper or plastic; chill.
Up to 1 hour before serving, whip the cream and powdered sugar until
nearly stiff; stir in the vanilla. Pipe or spoon a wide border around
the edge of the pie. Chill until needed and serve cold.
