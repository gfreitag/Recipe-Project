This is one of the simplest desserts. Roasted chestnuts make a
delicious fall dessert, especially when served with a dessert wine
and dried figs.

2 pounds fresh chestnuts in their shells

1. Preheat the oven to 400-F.

2. Using a sharp knife, cut an X in the top side of the chestnut
shell. Arrange the chestnuts in a single layer in a baking pan and
place them in the oven. Roast for 20 minutes. Allow to cool slightly
and serve warm in their shells. Shells will peel off easily.
