Title: Phillipine Chicken
Categories: Crockpot, Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Soy sauce
2    Garlic cloves; chopped
6    Chicken Breasts, skinned
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Vinegar
Put in crockpot. Cook for 6 to 8 hrs on LOW. Serve over rice. The
original recipe used 1 chicken, cut up. I used frozen, boneless
chicken breasts straight from the freezer and reduced the water to
3/4 cup. This is the best "new" recipe I have tried in ages.
