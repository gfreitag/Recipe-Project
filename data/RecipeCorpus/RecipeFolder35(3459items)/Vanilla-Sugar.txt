Because of its fragrance, vanilla sugar seems sweeter than unflavored
sugar, either granulated or powdered.  Use granulated

vanilla sugar sparingly to enhance the flavor of sliced fruits; and
use it, too, in place of regular sugar in delicate pastries and
desserts. Sprinkle a snowfall of powdered vanilla sugar over crepes,
sponge cake, Ladyfingers, or Pound Cake.  It is also particularly
good for making icings. Simply bury one, two, or even more vanilla
beans in a jar of sugar and cover it with a tight lid.  If you want
the beans to flavor the sugar more quickly, cut them lengthwise with
kitchen shears. Do this over the container of sugar so the tiny seeds
~ source of much of the flavor - will land where they belong.
Fine-quality vanilla beans will aromatize for many months, so it's
feasible to add more sugar as you use your supply.  When the beans
are quite dry, they can still be used to flavor custards or syrups
before being discarded; or powder them in a spice mill and use the
mild vanilla "dust" as a flavoring. The slight dampness of vanilla
beans may cause powdered sugar to lump, but this is no problem if you
sift it before using it. Better Than Store-Bought From the collection
