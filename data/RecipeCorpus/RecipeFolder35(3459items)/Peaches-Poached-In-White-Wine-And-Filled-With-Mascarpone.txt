PESCHE RIPIENE
This is a simple dessert to prepare, but very elegant. Serve it in
large goblets for an impressive effect.

1 cup dry Italian white wine, such as Pinot Grigio or Chardonnay 1/2
cup sugar 6 large peaches (about 2 pounds), peeled, halved, and
pitted 1 cup mascarpone 1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts

1. Combine the wine and sugar in a large, shallow, non-aluminum
saucepan with a cover. Place over medium heat and stir until the
sugar dissolves. Place the peaches in the pan, cut side down. Cover
the pan, raise the heat to medium-high, and bring the liquid to a
boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, keep covered, and simmer the
peaches for 10 minutes. Turn the peaches over and cook for an
additional 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool. Refrigerate
for at least 3 hours before serving.

2. Just before serving, place the peaches, cut side up, with some of
the cooking liquid in individual serving dishes. Place a heaping
tablespoon of the mascarpone-and-nut mixture in the center of each
peach half. Garnish with chopped walnuts.

VARIATION: Omit the mascarpone-and-nut mixture and serve the poached
peaches with fresh raspberries or blackberries and some of the
poaching liquid.
