Title: Bul Kogi (Fire Beef)
Categories: Meats, Korean, Microwave
Yield: 1 recipe
1 tb Rice vinegar
1 tb Toasted sesame seeds
1 1/2 ts Minced garlic
1/8 ts Black pepper
1 lb Beef flank steak
2 1/2 tb Sliced green onion top
2 tb Low-sodium soy sauce
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1 tb Sesame oil
Slice flank steak across grain into 1/8" slices.  Place in a 1 1/2
quart casserole.  Combine green onion, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil,
vinegar, sesame seeds, garlic and pepper in a 1 cup glass measure.
Pour over meat, cover and marinate in refrigerator for 1-2 hours.
Remove lid and cover casserole with waxed paper. (This will hold in
heat but not "steam" the meat during microwaving.)  Stirring midway
through cooking, microwave on high 6 minutes, or until meat is no
longer pink.

NOTE: Serve with rice.  The marinade is cooked with the meat and does
provide extra liquid that can be spooned over rice. Traditionally
there isn't any liquid since the meat is grilled.
