1. Cut the ends off squash, and cut into 1/4-inch slices. Set aside
2. In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, begin to saute onions and

garlic in the cooking spray, over medium low heat. After about 5
minutes, add squash, herbs, and salt. Stir, cover, and cook about 10
minutes more. 3. Gradually sprinkle the flour, stirring constantly.
Continue to stir over low heat for 5 minutes. 4. Pour in wine, stir
briefly, COVER and let simmer at least 20 minutes, stirring carefully
every 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow the soup to cool enough
to puree it. (Don't cheat on the time, you'll end up with winey
soup!) 5. Puree the soup with milk in a food processor until smooth
(I needed to use two batches - A) and return it to soup pot. Adjust
the seasonings, and add black pepper to taste 6. Heat -gently- just
before serving (I think it's worth using fresh herbs, just in
principle. Even more reason: leaving out the butter and high-fat milk
makes this soup bland if you use the dry herbs. Incidentally, I'm not
a big squash eater, but this is SO YUMMY, I'll certainly make it for
every day - A) From: anitaepler@eworld.com - AnitaEpler at eWorld
