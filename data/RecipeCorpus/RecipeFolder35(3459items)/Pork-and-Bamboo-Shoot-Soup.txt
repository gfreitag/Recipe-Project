This northern Thai soup works well with tinned bamboo shoots and is
thus well suited to the Western kitchen. I also find that in winter,
black radish substitutes very well.
Heat the oil in a large Saucepan and stir in the garlic, and ground
spices. Fry a few seconds until the garlic is just lightly browned.
Stir in the pork and stir fry the meat until browned on both sides.
Add the fish sauce, sugar and stock and bring to the boil. reduce the
heat, cover and simmer 15 minutes.
Add the thinly sliced bamboo shoots or radish, stir well, return
to the boil, adjust the seasoning, and serve garnished with a light
sprinkling of finely chopped spring onions (scallions) or watercress.
