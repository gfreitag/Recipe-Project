Title: Low-Fat Chocolate Pudding
Categories: Desserts, Puddings, Low cal/fat
Yield: 2 servings
1/8 ts Ground cloves
1 c  Skim milk
1/2    Vanilla bean, split or
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa
1/3 c  Sugar
1 tb Cornstarch
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
Combine the cocoa, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and cloves in a bowl
and whisk until smooth. Scald the milk with the vanilla bean in the
top of a double boiler.

Whisk the scalded milk into the cocoa mixture in a thin stream.
Return this mixture to a heavy saucepan and boil for 1 minute,
whisking constantly to prevent the milk from scorching. Remove the
pan from the heat and remove the vanilla bean. (If you're using
vanilla extract, whisk it in at this point.)

Transfer the pudding to a bowl and press a piece of plastic wrap on
top to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool to room temperature,
then chill. Spoon into bowls for serving.
