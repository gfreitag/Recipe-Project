Categories: Seafood, Cajun/creol, Stove top
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
1/4 t  Thyme
pn Cayenne
1 1/2 c  Hot cooked rice
1 c  Chopped onion
1/4 c  Chopped celery
1/2 c  Water
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
3 ea Cloves garlic, minced
1/8 t  Freshly ground black pepper
6 oz Raw peeled shrimp
1/2 c  Chopped green onion
2 T  Dry brown "roux" (recipe
-follows)
Cook the vegetables in a saucepan over high heat, stirring frequently
to prevent sticking and burning, until the vegetables color slightly,
about 2 minutes. Add the "roux" and blend in the water. Add all the
seasonings and simmer slowly for 20 minutes. Just before serving, add
the shrimp and cook for 2 minutes, or just until they turn pink and
are good and hot. Spoon the rice into warm serving dishes or bowls
and ladle the Etouffee over. Don't overcook the shrimp. They should
be firm with a nice al dente texture. Watch the liquid. You want a
sort-of gravy affair, not dry. Washed crawfish meat can be
substituted for the shrimp. Dry "Roux" 1 cup all-purpose flour Put
the flour in a heavy skillet and place over moderate heat. Stir the
flour around often with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Pay attention to
the cooking because the flour will take about 5-7 minutes to begin
coloring. At this point you have a blond "roux". For the next 5-7
minutes it will darken until it reaches a light wood color. Stir
constantly to keep the flour in the bottom of the skillet moving so
it will not burn, and so that all the flour in the pan will color
evenly. The whole process takes about 15 minutes of close attention
to get a good rich "roux". When the flour is cooked without oil it
will not become as brown as we eventually want it to. When you mix it
with an equal amount of liquid to add it to a dish it will darken
properly. What you donUt use immediately can be stored unrefrigerated
in a tightly capped jar almost indefinitely.
