Title: Almond and Pistachio Brittle
Categories: Candy, Dessert, Indian
Yield: 8 servings
3/4 c  Pistachios, slivered
3/4 c  Unblanched almonds, slivered
Vegetable oil
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
1 c  Sugar
Oil a large wooden board or marble slab, rolling pin and blade of a
large knife.

In a heavy 3-quart saucepan, heat 1/2 cup oil over medium high heat
for 5 minutes.  Add sugar and cook until sugar begins to turn golden,
2 to 3 minutes.  When oil begins to separate from sugar, start
stirring constantly until sugar is completely dissolved and no lumps
remain (about 2-3 minutes).  Mixture should be smooth and light
brown. Pour off as much of the oil as can be easily removed, leaving
the syrup behind in the pan. Reduce heat to low, stir in nuts, then
remove from heat. Immediately pour mixture onto prepared board. Roll
out to 1/4-inch thickness. Quickly cut into small squares while still
hot. Store brittle in airtight container.
