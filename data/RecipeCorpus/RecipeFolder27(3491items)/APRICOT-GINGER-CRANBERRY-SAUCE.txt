Categories: Salsa/sauce, Fruit, Side dish, Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
12 oz Fresh (or thawed frozen)
-cranberries
1/2 c  Plus 1 tbsp. sugar
1 tb Minced, pared, fresh ginger
INGREDIENTS:
14    Dried apricots, each cut
-into 3 strips
1/2 c  Cranberry juice
Soak  the  dried  apricots  in the cranberry  juice  in  a  medium
saucepan for  ten minutes.   Add the remaining ingredients and  stir
them well. Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until the
cranberries have popped and the syrup has thickened slightly - that
should take about 5 minutes.    Let  the sauce cool to room
temperature, then refrigerate it (covered) until it's *cold*.  It can
be stored in the fridgipater for up to a week. Transfer the sauce to
a serving dish and serve while it's still cold.  The colder the
better, so long as it isn't frozen.
