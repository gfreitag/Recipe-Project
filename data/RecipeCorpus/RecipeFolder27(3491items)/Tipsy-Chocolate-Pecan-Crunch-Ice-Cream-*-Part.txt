8    Egg yolks
1 oz Unsweetened chocolate;
-broken into 1/2 oz pcs
1/4 c  Myer's Dark Rum
1 c  Pecan halves
2 c  Heavy cream
2 c  Granulated sugar
2 c  Half-and-half
1/4 t  Lemon juice
EQUIPMENT: Measuring cup, measuring spoons, baking sheet with sides,
2 2 1/2-qt. saucepan, whisk, metal spoon, cook's knife, cutting
board, 2-qt. plastic container w/ lid, electric mixer with paddle,
rubber spatula, instant-read test thermometer, 2 stainless steel
bowls (1 large), ice cream freezer

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast the pecan halves on a baking
sheet in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Cool to room
temperature. Combine 1 1/4 cups of sugar and the lemon juice in a 2
1/2-qt saucepan. Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will
resemble moist sand). Caramelize the sugar for 8 to 10 minutes over
medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a whisk to break up any
lumps (the sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then light
brown as it caramelizes). Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the
unsweetened chocolate and stir gently to blend. Pour the
chocolate-caramel mixture over the pecans and stir with a spoon to
completely coat the pecans with the chocolate caramel; spread the
mixture evenly over the bottom of the baking sheet. Freeze the
chocolate pecan crunch for 20 minutes. Remove from the freezer. Chop
the chocolate pecan crunch into 1/4" pieces. Store in a sealed
plastic container in the freezer until needed.
