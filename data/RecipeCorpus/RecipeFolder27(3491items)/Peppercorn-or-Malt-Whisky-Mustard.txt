MMMMM--------------------MALT WHISKY MUSTARD-------------------------
5    Fluid ounces malt whisky*

Grind the mustard seeds in a clean coffee grinder.  Put them in a
glass or ceramic bowl, stir in the water and leave about 10 minutes.
Then mix in the rest of the ingredients with a wooden spoon.  If the
mixture seems too dry add more liquid.  It should be moist but not
running. Cover the bowl and leave overnight.  Pack into clean, dry,
small pots or jars. Seal with plastic-lined lids or with clean corks.
Keep at least 2 weeks before opening.

Note:  The authors mention that the mustards need time to mellow.
They are acrid-tasting at first but mellow in a few weeks and won't
spoil with age. If the mustards dry out, they can be revived by
adding wine, vinegar or oil.
