1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. In a large bowl, beat together corn oil and
granulated sugar with an electric mixer until well blended. Add cocoa,
cranberry sauce, orange juice, and orange zest. Beat until well
blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

2. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add to
cranberry mixture and beat on low speed just until combined. Stir in
chocolate chips and pecans. Turn batter into a well-greased 12-cup
bundt pan, spreading evenly.

3. Bake 45 to 50 mins, or until a cake tester inserted in center
comes out clean. Let cake cool in pan 20 to 30 mins, then unmold onto
a rack and let cool completely. Dust top with a sifting of powdered
sugar before serving.
