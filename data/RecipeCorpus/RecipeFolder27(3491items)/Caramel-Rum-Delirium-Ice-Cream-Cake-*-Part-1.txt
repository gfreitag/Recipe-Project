-(recipe posted earlier)
1 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 t  Lemon juice
4 T  + 2 t unsalted butter
2 c  + 1 T all purpose flour
2 t  Baking soda
1/2 t  Salt
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 lb Cream cheese; softened
EQUIPMENT: 2 1/2-qt saucepan, whisk, stainless steel bowl, 9 x 3-inch
springform pan, electric mixer with paddle, rubber spatula, red
toothpick, 10-inch plate, serrated slicer, large 100%-cotton kitchen
towel, cake spatula

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. To prepare the caramel flavoring,
combine the granulated sugar and lemon juice in a 2 1/2-qt saucepan
and stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist
sand). Caramelize the sugar for 5 to 6 minutes over medium-high heat,
stirring constantly to break up any lumps (the sugar will first turn
clear as it liquefies, then brown as it caramelizes). Remove the
saucepan from the heat and carefully add the heavy cream; stir to
combine (the mixture will steam and boil rapidly as the cream is
added). Transfer the caramel to a stainless steel bowl and allow to
cool to room temperature.
