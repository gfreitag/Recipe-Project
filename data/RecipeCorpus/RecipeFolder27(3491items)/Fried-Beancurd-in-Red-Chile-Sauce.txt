Title: Fried Beancurd in Red Chile Sauce
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Asian
Yield: 4 servings
1    Fresh chile (green or red)
-- minced
1/2 ts Sugar (optional)
19 oz Tofu, preferably firm
Vegetable oil; for frying
1 ts Crushed toasted sesame seeds
2 tb Korean red chile flakes
2 tb Tamari or soy sauce
1 tb Water
1 ts Sesame oil
1    Garlic clove; minced
3    Scallions; sliced
In a bowl, combine red chiles, tamari or soy sauce, water, sesame oil,
minced garlic, sliced scallions, fresh chile and sugar (if using). Set
aside until tofu is fried.

Cut tofu into serving portions or largish chunks, and pat dry with
paper towels.  Heat 1 or 2 inches of vegetable oil in a skillet or
wok set over moderately high heat. Fry tofu pieces until golden brown
on all sides, turning as necessary. Remove tofu from oil and place in
a deep serving dish or shallow bowl.  Pour chile mixture over tofu,
turning pieces to coat evenly. Spinkle with crushed toasted sesame
seeds and serve warm with hot steamed rice, and assorted vegetable
relishes or dressed salad greens.

Leftovers can be coarsely chopped and mixed with some corn kernels or
other veggies for a yummy (cold or hot) filling in flour tortillas.
