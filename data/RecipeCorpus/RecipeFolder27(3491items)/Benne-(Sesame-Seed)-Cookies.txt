Title: Benne (Sesame Seed) Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 ts Salt
3/4 c  Butter or margarine, melted
1    Egg
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Benne (sesame) seeds
1 1/2 c  Brown sugar, packed
1 c  All-purpose flour

Known as sesame seeds in most of the country, "benne" is the name
southerners learned to call these seeds, which were brought from
Africa by slaves. Toasting benne seeds develop their flavor and also
gives these cookies a slightly crunchy texture.

Heat oven to 375ø. Toast benne seeds on ungreased baking sheet until
light brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Watch closely so they don't burn.

In a large bowl, mix all ingredients. Drop dough by 1/2 teaspoonfuls
1 1/2 inches apart onto greased baking sheet. Bake at 375ø until
light brown, about 4-6 minutes. Cool about 2 minutes before removing
from baking sheets to wire rack to cool completely. Store in tightly
covered cookie tin when thoroughly cooled.

Yield: about 6 dozen. Pat Thomas, retired food editor, Yakima WA
