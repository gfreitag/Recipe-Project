-across, and I must say it
Is both very easy and VERY
-good to eat.  I halved the
-following recipe (but
Used the full amount of
-garlic, plus 2 c of meaty
-red sauce, about 4 oz. of
The following recipe is for
-"focaccia Romana," or
-Roman focaccia, from Jeff
Smith's "The Frigal Gourmet
-Cooks Three Ancient
-Cuisines."  He recommends
It as the best dough for a
-pizza crust he's run
pepperoni, 8-9 fresh mushrooms and 8 ounces of whole-milk mozzarella)
and the results were great.  Lacking quick-rise yeast, I used regular
yeast and just ate a little later ++ no problem there.  And of
course, I made the dough into a pizza instead of a plain focaccia
(which is like a thick pizza (also round, but thicker) but without
toppings. 2 pkg fast-rising dry yeast 2 c tepid (90F) water 2 Tbsp
sugar 4 Tbsp olive oil 1/2 c oil 1 tsp salt 5 1/2 c unbleached white
flour 3 cloves garlic, crushed 1/4 c olive oil for topping (if making
focaccia only) 1 Tbsp whole rosemary (ditto) 1 Tbsp kosher salt
(ditto) Dissolve the yeast in the tepid water. Add the sugar, olive
oil, oil, and salt. Mix in 3 c of the flour and whip until the dough
begins to leave the sides of the mixing bowl, about ten minutes [!!].
I [Smith] use my KitchenAid mixer for the whole process. Mix in the
remaining flour by hand or with a dough hook and knead the dough
until it is smooth. Allow the dough to rise twice, right in the bowl,
and punch down after each rising. Oil 2 baking sheets, each 13 inches
by 18 inches, and divide the dough between the 2 pans.  Using your
fingers, press the dough out to the edges of each pan. Allow to rise
for about 30 minutes and brush with the crushed garlic mixed with the
oil for topping. Sprinkle the rosemary and kosher salt on top. Bake
at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes.
