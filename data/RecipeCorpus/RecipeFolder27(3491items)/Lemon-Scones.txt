mixture resembles coarse meal.  Blend in eggs and just enough milk or
buttermilk to form soft but not sticky dough.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface.  Gently roll or pat
dough to about 1/2-inch thickness, lightly flouring as necessary to
prevent sticking.  Cut out rounds using 2-inch flourd biscuit cutter.
Set 1/2 inch apart on prepared baking sheets.  Brush with cream. Bake
