add additional 2 1/4 cups flour or enough to make soft dough,
blending thoroughly.

Turn out onto lightly floured board and knead until smooth and
elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, turning to

let rise in warm place until doubled in volume.  Punch down and let

Beat egg with water.  Place dough on lightly floured board and divide
in half, then divide each half into 3 equal pieces.  Roll each into
12-inch rope.  Lay 3 ropes parallel and begin braiding in the middle,
working out to each end (make braids very loose). Pinch ends together
securely. Repeat with remaining ropes. Place loaves on baking sheet,
brush tops with beaten egg and sprinkle with seeds. Cover with
plastic wrap and allow to rise until doubled.

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Bake loaves until golden and bread sounds
hollow when tapped, about 35 to 45 minutes.  Cool on racks.
