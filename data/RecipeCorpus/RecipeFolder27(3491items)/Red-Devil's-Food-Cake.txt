1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans. Dust with
flour; tap out excess.

2. In a large bowl, beat together butter and sugar with an electric
mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 mins. With mixer
on low, beat in cocoa until well blended. Return speed to medium and
add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

3. Mix together tomato juice and vinegar. Sift together flour and
baking soda. With mixer on low speed, beat into chocolate mixture
alternately with tomato juice mixture just until combined. Turn
batter into prepared pans.

4. Bake 35 to 40 mins, or until a cake tester inserted in center
comes out clean. Let cakes cool in pans 10 mins, then unmold to racks
and let cool completely.

5. Fill and frost with Fudge Frosting. Sprinkle walnuts over top and
press into sides of cake.
