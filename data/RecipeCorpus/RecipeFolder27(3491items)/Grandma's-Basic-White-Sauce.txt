Title: Grandma's Basic White Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts White pepper
1/8 ts Fresh ground nutmeg*
1 tb Butter*
1 sm Chopped shallot (about 2 tb)
2 tb Flour
1 1/2 c  Warm milk*
In a medium sauce pan melt the butter over moderate heat.  Add the
shallot and saute, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Lower the heat, add the
flour, and cook stirring, 3 minutes more or until the roux is golden
and bubbling. Pour in the milk and bring it to a simmer, stirring
constantly, for 5 minutes or until thickened and smooth.  Add the
salt, pepper and nutmeg. The recipe makes a scant 2 cup, but easily
doubles if you need more.

*We substitute unsalted butter (or Weight Watchers low-fat
substitute) for Grandma's butter, and use skim milk or 2% lowfat
instead of the whole milk she used, with no trouble at all.
