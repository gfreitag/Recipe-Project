Chop onions fine; peel tomatoes; chop and save juice.  Chop red

in squares. Put lard to melt in a sop pot; add chopped onions, ham,
and the sliced okra. When well browned, add tomatoes with juice; cook
until tender. Then add oysters, shrimp, and crab (which have been
prepared). Add red pepper, bay leaf, parsley, and thyme.  When
everything is well fried and browned, add 3 quarts water.  Let simmer
gently one hour or longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Serve with cooked rice.
