MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
2 T  Peanut oil**
Cornstarch paste
4 lg Cloves garlic
1/4 c  Canned baby clams*
Preparation:  Wash broccoli and cut off flowerettes (save for another
dish). With small paring knife, carefully peel outer skin off broccoli
stems, beginning at the base.  Leave inner stems whole.  Cut stems on
the bias into 1/4" slices. Rinse fermented soy beans. Peel garlic.
Mince together soy beans and garlic; then mash to a paste using
mortar and pestle; set aside.  Place drained baby clams in stock. If
substituting fresh clams, crabmeat or shrimp, wash, shell and chop
into small pieces. Stir-frying:  Heat wok to hot, then add first of
oil.  When oil just begin to smoke, add broccoli and toss quickly to
avoid burning. Stir-fry about 1 minute.  Turn heat down to moderate
(or on electric range, remove from heat).  Push broccoli up side of
wok; add remaining oil to bottom of wok; add soy bean mixture.  Press
and stir until odor of beans and garlic is present. Return to high
heat and immediately recombine with broccoli, stirring constantly for
about 30 seconds. Beans and garlic will burn easily, so keep mixture
moving. Quickly add clams and stock; stir-fry for another 30 seconds.
Cover for 30 seconds to finish cooking broccoli. Remove cover;
thicken with cornstarch paste to light sauce.
