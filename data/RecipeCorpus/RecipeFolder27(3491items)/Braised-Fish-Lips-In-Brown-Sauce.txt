would spareribs. Blanch them in boiling water. Add cooking wine to
boiling water and blanch twice more to remove the fishy smell. Blanch
the ham, mushrooms and bamboo shoots in boiling water. Heat soup
stock and add soy sauce, MSG, salt, sugar, ginger juice and molasses
to it. When it comes to a boil, put in the fish lips and simmer for
10 minutes. Continue to simmer for a short while. Add cornstarch
mixture to thicken the sauce. Sprinkle with peppercorns. Transfer to
plate and serve. This is a famous banquet delicacy. Submitted By
