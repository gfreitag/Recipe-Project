Title: Steak in Red Wine Sauce
Categories: Meat
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Dry red wine
1/4 c  Beef stock or bouillon
1 pn Dried thyme
Salt and pepper to taste
2 lb Filet mignon strip steaks
2 tb Oil
2 tb Unsalted butter
1/4 c  Chopped shallots or scallion
1/2 ts Finely minced garlic
TRIM STEAKS TO REMOVE any excess fat, and set aside. Heat the oil in a
skillet or saute pan over high heat. Add steaks and sear on each side
for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium high, and cook the steaks for
2 to 3 minutes on a side for rare meat, or longer to taste. Remove
the meat from the pan, and place it on a serving platter in a 200F
oven to keep warm. Pour off the grease, and place the pan over medium
heat. Add the butter, and saute the shallots and garlic, stirring
frequently, for 5 minutes. Raise the heat to medium high, add the
wine, stock and thyme, and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced
by 1/2. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour the sauce over the
steaks. Serve immediately.
