At Olivieri Prince of Steaks in Philadelphia, chef/owner Rick Olivieri
(third generation) tells us about the original. "It all started in
1932 with my grandfather Pat. He owned a small hot-dog stand but got
tired of eating hot dogs every day, so he sent his brother around the
corner for sliced steak. He prepared it, slapped it into a hot-dog
bun and was just about to eat it when a cabbie pulled up and said,
'Hey, that looks good.' The rest, as they say, is history, part of
which included the addition of cheese in the late 1940's, when they
were looking to try something new."

To make one cheese-steak sandwich, take the steak (Olivieri's
recommended cut: the eye of the chuck) and slice it very thin. Panfry
in large skillet with no grease or oil, just enough water to moisten.
Right before it's done, top with desired cheese (American, provolone,
mozzarella or Cheez Whiz) until melted. Put meat and cheese on the
hoagie roll, then top with fried onions. Add additional toppings if
desired. *Article from Woman's Day magazine*
