Complete Title; Creamed Chicken and Potato Soup with Avocado and
Capers Directions: In a heavy 5 quart casserole, combine the chicken,
shinbone and water. The water should cover the chicken by about an
inch; if necessary add more water. Bring to a boil over high heat,
skimming off the scum that rises to the surface.  Add the onion, bay
leaf, cumin, thyme, salt and pepper. Reduce the heat or low, cover
and cook for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is tender.  Transfer
the chicken to a platter. Pick out and discard the shinbones and
onion, strain the stock through a fine sieve and return it to the
casserole. Remove the skin from the chicken with a small knife or
your fingers. Cut or pull the meat away from the bones; discard the
skin and bones. Cut the chicken meat into strips1/4 inch wide and1
to11/2 long. Return the stock in the casserole to a boil over
moderate heat, and drop in the potatoes.  Cover and cook for 30
minutes, or until the potatoes are soft, then mash them against the
sides of the pan with a spoon until the soup is thick and fairly
smooth.  Add the corn and chicken, and simmer, uncovered, for 5 to10
minutes, depending on the tenderness of the corn. To serve, pour 3
tbs. of cream and1 tsp of capers into each of 6 deep soup bowls.
Ladle the soup into the bowls and float the sliced avocado on top.
