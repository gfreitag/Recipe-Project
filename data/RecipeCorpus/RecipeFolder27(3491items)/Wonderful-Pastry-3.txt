edges together or press piece of pastry over tear.) With paper side

into plate. (For two-crust pie follow individual pie recipe. For 8"
or 9" pie shell, see below.)

min.; if bubbles appear, prick. Cool on wire rack before filling.

water for milk; for pie shell, 1/4 cup minus 1 teasp. ice water. Beat
water with salad oil until thickened and creamy. Then add
immediately, all at once, to flour. When rolling dough, use unfloured
board instead of waxed paper if desired.
