Title: Ricotta Cheese Pie with Pine Nut Crust
Categories: Dessert, Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1/2 c  Pine nuts
1/4 c  Butter unsalted
3/4 c  Crumbs from amaretto cookies
MMMMM-----------------------CHEESE FILLING----------------------------
2 tb Four
2 ts Lemon peel
2    Eggs
15 oz Ricotta cheese
1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Sour cream
Berries, grapes, or orange garnish.

To make crust, place melted butter in 9 inch pie plate. Stir in cookie
crumbs and pine nuts until well blended. Press firmly against bottom
and sides of dish to form crust. Heat until set.

To make filling, combine ricotte cheese, sour cream, sugar, flour,
lemon peel, and eggs in 8 cup glass measure. Heat until center is
very warm to the touch, stirring every two minutes. (Microwave is
easy). Mixture will be a little lumpy at this point but will cook
into a smooth pie. Pour filling into crust, smoothing it evenly on
top. Place pie on top of microwave proof cereal bowl and microwave on
medium for 8 to 14 minutes or until almost set in center, rotating
one quarter turn once or twice. Let stand directly on counter for 30
minutes.  Chill for 3 hours or overnight before serving. Garnish pie.
To test to see if done, touch the top 1 inch from the center with
your finger. When top adheres to your finger, cheese cake underneath
should appear to be moist but set, not gooey. Sides should begin to
pull away from dish.
