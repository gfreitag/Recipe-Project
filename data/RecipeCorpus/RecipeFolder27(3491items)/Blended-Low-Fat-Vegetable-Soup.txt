Title: Blended Low Fat Vegetable Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetable, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 c  Carrots, thinly sliced
1/2 c  Tomato, chopped, seeded
1 t  Fresh parsley, chopped
1/4 t  Basil leaves
1/8 t  Pepper
1/4 c  Diced onion
2 pk Instant chicken broth &
-seasoning mix.
2    Garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 c  Zucchini, thinly sliced
Combine onion, garlic and broth mix in a pot.  Cook and stir
occasionally until the onion turns translucent.  Then add the rest of
the ingredients, with stirring.  Cover and cook on low heat, with
occasional stirring for roughly 10 minutes.  Add 2 cups of water and
bring it to a boil.

Then reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook 'til the veggies are soft,
maybe 20 minutes.  Then with a hand blender blend for a little bit
right in the pot to thicken the soup, being sure to leave a lot of
chunks of vegetables. The amount you blend depends on you own tastes.
Blend a few seconds, stir, and try it.

Shirley makes triple batches of this, because we love it, and because
it gets better and better when reheated as left-overs.  You might try
more pepper, it is very good as a peppery soup.
