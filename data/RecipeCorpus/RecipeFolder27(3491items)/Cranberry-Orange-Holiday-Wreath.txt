Prepare Cranberry Orange Nut Filling; set aside.

salt. Heat milk, water, honey and margarine until very warm (125 to
130 degrees F); stir into dry mixture.  Mix in 1 egg and enough
remaining flourto make soft dough.  On lightly floured surface, knead
until smooth and elastic, about 4 to 6 minutes.  Cover; let rest on
floured surface 10 minutes.

On floured surface, roll dough to 16X9-inch rectangle.  Spread with

up from long edge as for jelly roll; pinch seam to seal.  Place,
seam-side down, on baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray.  Form
into a ring and pinch ends to seal.  With sharp knife, cut slits
starting from outer edge, 2/3 of the way through dogh at 1-inch
intervals.  Turn each section on its side to show filling.  Spray
dough with cooking spray.  cover; let rise in warm draft-free place
until doubled in size, about 30to45 minutes.

Beat remaining egg; brush on dough.  Bake at 375 degrees for 25-35
minutes or until done.  Tent with foil during last 10 minutes of
baking to prevent over browning.  remove from sheet; coon on wire
rack.  Drizzle with confectioners sugar glaze.
