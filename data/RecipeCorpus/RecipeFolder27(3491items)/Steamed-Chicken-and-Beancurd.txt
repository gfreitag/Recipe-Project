Categories: Chicken, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
1 pn Sugar
1/2 c  Stock
Cornstarch paste
1 c  Chicken meat, minced
3 ea Egg whites
1 T  Gin
1/4 t  Salt
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
1 lg Carrot

3 lg Cabbage or lettuce leaves
2 c  Beancurd, mashed
1/2 t  Ginger juice
1 T  Peanut oil
1/2 t  Five-spice powder
All mixing can be done in food processor.  Or, use cleaver to finely
mince chicken and mash beancurd.  In bowl, combine egg whites, oil,
ginger juice, gin, salt, five-spice powder and sugar; stir to break
down egg and blend. Add chicken and beancurd; mix thoroughly. Dip
cabbage leaves in boiling water to make limp.  Wash and peel carrot;
slice thinly on bias. Steaming: Place limp leaves in shallow bowl.
Arrange carrots on leaves in decorative pattern.  Pack
chicken/beancurd mixture tightly in bowl to fill it. Steam for about
40 minutes at medium boil.  Steaming will make mixture very smooth
and firm (avoid over-steaming, which causes beancurd to become dry
and hard).  When ready to serve, turn out on serving platter; gently
remove leaves; cover with glaze. Glaze: Heat stock in saucepan; when
hot, add cornstarch paste to thicken. When ready to use, reheat and
add sesame oil; pour over dish.
