Name: Seasoned Mashed Potatoes with Fish and Vegetables

THE SAUCE:  Preheat the oven to 20 degrees F.  Drop the quartered
baking potatoes into a large pot with enough lightly salted boiling
water to cover them, and boil briskly until they are tender but not
falling apart. Meanwhile, make the sauce by combining the chopped
onions, lemon juice, 1 tb. of salt and 1/8 ts. black pepper and
Cayenne pepper, and beat them together with a whisk or fork.  Then
beat in 1 cup of the oil. Drain the potatoes and mash them to a
smooth puree either with a fork, a potato ricer or an electric mixer.
Beat in the sauce a tb. or so at a time and taste for seasoning.
Transfer the potatoes to a large heatproof serving platter, mound
them in the center, and cover the platter loosely with foil. Keep the
potatoes warm in the oven while you prepare the other ingredients.

THE TOPPING:  In a small saucepan, combine the sliced onions and chili
strips and add sufficient salted water to cover them completely.
Bring to a boil over high heat, then drain off all the water, and in
its place pour in the 1/2 cup of olive oil, the vinegar, 1 teaspoon
salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.  Bring this to a boil, then cover the
pan and simmer the mixture over moderate heat for about 5 minutes.
Turn off the heat and cover the pan to keep it warm.
