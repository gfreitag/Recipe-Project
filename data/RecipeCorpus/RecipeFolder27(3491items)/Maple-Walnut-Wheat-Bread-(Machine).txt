One of our favorite restaurants makes all its own baked goods. At
dinner, they feature a homemade loaf with a tantalizing flavor. We
finally discovered it's maple. After dining in that exceptional
restaurant many times, this bread has become a must. We have created
it for you. From "Easy Baking" by Claudia Burns and Tom Lacalamita
