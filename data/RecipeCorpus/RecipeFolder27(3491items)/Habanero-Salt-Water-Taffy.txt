Title: Habanero Salt Water Taffy
Categories: Candy, Hot/spicy, Chilies
Yield: 2 1/2 pounds
4 ts Glycerin
4 tb Butter
1/2 ts Habanero Chile, minced fine
4 c  Sugar
2 c  Light corn syrup
3 c  Water
3 ts Salt
Combine sugar, syrup, water, salt and glycerin in a heavy saucepan.
Place on low heat and stir until sugar dissolves.  Then cook without
stirring to the hard ball stage (260).

Remove from heat and add butter and minced Habanero chile.  Stir until
butter is melted, then pour into 2 buttered shallow pans (about 13 x
9).

When cool enough to handle, gather into a ball and pull until rather
firm. Stretch out into a long rope and cut in 1 or 2" pieces.  Wrap
each piece in waxed paper when hard; twist paper at both ends.  This
will keep the candy from becoming sticky.

Makes about 2 1/2 pounds.

Note: This is not for the feint of heart or pallet.  This is only for
the confirmed Chile-Heads who are looking for a real kick.

WARNING: NOT FOR CHILDREN
