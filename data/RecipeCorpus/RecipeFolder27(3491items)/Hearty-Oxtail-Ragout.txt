Place oxtails, pig's feet and onions in casserole. Add salt and
pepper. Brown quickly in a preheated 450-F oven (this will take
approximately 30 minutes). Add to the casserole the sliced onions,
carrots, leeks, thyme, rosemary, bay leaf, ginger, wine and enough
water to cover. Cover and bake for 4 to 5 hours. Pour off the juices
into a saucepan and place over low heat. Mash together equal
quantities of flour and butter with a fork. Form into small balls.
Stir these gradually into the juices, cooking until slightly
thickened. Return the juices to the casserole. Serve with potatoes
cooked in their jackets and some sour pickles. Coleslaw is a good
accompaniment to this substantial dish. A light dessert like lemon
ice would be a suitable finale.
