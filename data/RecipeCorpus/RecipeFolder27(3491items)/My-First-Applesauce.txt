Title: My First Applesauce
Categories: Mom's, Fruit, Microwave, Kids
Yield: 17 1-oz-serv.
6 md Golden Delicious apples
WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT AN APPLE A DAY WILL KEEP THE DOCTOR AWAY, BUT
WE DO KNOW THIS APPLESAUCE IS DELICIOUS AND CONTAINS LOTS OF VITAMINS
AND MINERALS.  WE RECOMMEND USING GOLDEN DELICIOUS APPLES IN BABY'S
FIRST SAUCE SINCE THIS VARIETY IS THE LEAST ACIDIC.  IF YOU CAN'T
FIND THEM, ANOTHER ALL-PURPOSE COOKING APPLE SUCH AS ROME CAN BE
SUBSTITUTED.  jUST BE SURE TO AVOID THE ACIDIC GREEN-SKINNED APPLES,
SUCH AS GRANNY SMITHS, IN THE FIRST YEAR.  LEAVING THE PEEL ON THE
APPLE DURING COOKING MAKES FOR A MORE NUTRIENT-RICH AND TASTIER SAUCE.

Wash, quarter, and core apples just before cooking.  Place prepared
apple quarters in a steamer basket set in a pot filled with a small
amount of lightly boiling water.  Cover tightly (for better nutrient
retention) and steam for 10 to 12 minutes or until apples are tender,
replenishing water during steaming if necessary.  Check for doneness
with a toothpick or fork; apples should pierce easily.  Set apples
and cooking liquid aside to cool. Strain cooked apples in a food mill
to puree and remove the skins. Or scrape the apple from the skin and
puree in a food processor fitted with the steel blade.  Add about 1
tablespoon reserved cooking liquid per apple to puree, adjusting
consistency according to the age and preference of your baby.

MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS: Place prepared apple quarters in microwave-safe
dish. Add Â¬ cup water and cover tightly with plastic wrap, turning
back one corner to vent. Microwave on HIGH for 3 minutes, stir apples
thoroughly, re-cover and cook for 3 to 6 minutes or until tender.
Check for doneness, cool, and proceed with recipe.

Makes 16 to 18 1-ounce or heaped tablespoon baby servings.

Line a cookie sheet or platter with waxed paper.  Place applesauce in
heaped tablespoons (like cookie dough) on waxed paper.  Freeze.  When
frozen, peel off and store in bulk in large plastic bags.  Be sure to
label with identity and date.  Refrigerate 2-3 days, freeze up to one
month (longer in deep freeze).

You can also peel a few of the cooked apple quarters, slice thickly,
and freeze for a soothing snack for teething babies or summertime
finger food.
