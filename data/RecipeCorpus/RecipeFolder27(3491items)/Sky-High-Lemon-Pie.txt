Title: Sky-High Lemon Pie
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
1 T  Grated lemon rind
6 T  Lemon juice
2 T  Lemon extract
4 oz Can toasted coconut chips
1    Recipe plain pastry for 1  9
-inch crust
2 1/4 c  Sugar
4 T  Cornstarch
4 T  Flour
1/4 t  Salt
2 c  Water
4    Eggs, separated
Prepare pastry recipe.  Roll out to a 12 " round on a lightly floured
pastry cloth or board; fit into a 9" pie plate.  Trim overhang to
1/2"; turn under flush with rim & flute to make a stand-up edge;
prick well all over with a fork.

Bake in hot oven, 425, for 15 minutes or until golden; cool
completely on a wire rack

Mix 1-3/4 cups of the sugar, cornstarch, flour, and salt in a
medium-size bowl.

Heat water to boiling in a medium-size saucepan.  Lower heat to
medium; slowly add sugar mixture, stirring gently but constantly.
Cook, stirring constantly, 5 to 7 minutes or until mixture holds a
line when cut with a spoon; remove from heat at once.  Do not let
mixture boil.

Beat egg yolks slightly in bowl; stir in 1/2 cup hot mixture; quickly
stir back into mixture in saucepan.  Cook, stirring constantly over
medium heat, for 3 minutes or until mixture thickens.  Remove from
heat.

Stir in lemon rind, juice, butter or margarine until blended.  Pour
into cool pastry shell.

Beat egg whites with lemon extract until foamy, white and double in
volume in bowl.  Sprinkle in 1/2 cup sugar, 1 Tbsp. at a time,
beating all the time until sugar dissolves and meringue stands in
firm peaks.

Pile onto hot filling, spreading to edge of crust. This keeps
meringue from shrinking.  Sprinkle with coconut chips, or place them
in a pretty pattern on top.

Bake in moderate oven, 350 F degrees, 12 minutes, or until peaks of
meringue are a golden brown.  Cool completely on a wire rack before
cutting
