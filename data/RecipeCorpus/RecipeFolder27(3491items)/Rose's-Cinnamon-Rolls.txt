BASIC SWEET DOUGH  (makes enough for two dozen cinnamon rolls)

1  qt milk 3 oz yeast (6 small squares) 2 cups sugar 14 cups all
purpose flour 1 tb salt 1 lb sweet butter 12 egg yolks

Scald milk and cool to lukewarm.  Add yeast, 1 c. sugar and 2 c
flour. This is your sponge.  Let it rise about 30 minutes. In a large
bowl, sift in the rest of the flour, salt and remaining sugar.  With
your fingertips, work butter into the dry ingredients, then add yolks
and the yeast sponge. Stir, then work with your hands until quite
thick. Knead the dough on a board sprinkled with flour until it
becomes smooth and elastic. You may have to add more flour to make
for easier handling. Cover and let rise about 1 - 1 /2 hours. Punch
down and knead again for a few minutes. Cover and let rise again for
30 minutes.

POWDERED SUGAR GLAZE

2  cups powdered sugar 1 tsp vanilla 1/4 cups hot water (approx)
