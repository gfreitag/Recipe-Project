Rosendale Road London SE21 8LG Serves 4-6 METRIC/IMPERIAL U.S. 900
g/2 lb leeks 2 lb 900 g/2 lb potatoes
2 lb fine sea salt and freshly ground
black pepper 100 g/4 oz Gruyere cheese 1/4 lb dash of wine vinegar
Cut the leeks into 2.5 cm/1 inch chunks, including as much of the
green part as is possible. Wash thoroughly. Peel the potatoes and cut
into 2.5 cm/1 inch chunks. Simmer together with the leeks in boiling
salted water for 30-35 minutes or until very soft. Drain the
vegetables, then mash together until they resemble a puree of
potatoes. Mix in the grated cheese and the vinegar, with salt and
pepper to taste. An alternative version is to halve the amount of
potatoes, and to cook the vegetables in a mixture of white wine and
water.
