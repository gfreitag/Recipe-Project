1. Preheat oven to 450ø (if using cooking stone, it should heat in
oven for at least 20 minutes before baking).  Put tomatoes into a
baking dish; lay onions across top and drizzle oil evenly over all.
Roast in oven for 20 minutes; stir in garlic and mixed vegetables and
roast for another 20 minutes, or until tender.  Stir in oregano,
thyme, salt, tofu, and feta.

2. Roll or stretch out pizza doughs and place on floured pizza peel or
cookie sheet.  Divide roasted mix between the two doughs, placing
down the middle as for a burrito.  Gently fold the dough over the
filling and pinch closed.  Seal well and handle with care as any
holes will prevent the calzone from puffing up.  Bake for 20 minutes,
or until golden brown.
