Recipe by: The Frugal Gourmet On Our Immigrant Ancestors Soak the
mushrooms and drain them, reserving the soaking water. Chop the
mushrooms into 1/2-inch dice. Pour the mushroom water through a fine
strainer into the Beef Stock, avoiding any sand or grit that may be
in the bottom of the bowl. Bring the 2 cups of water to a boil in a
medium saucepan. Add the barley and simmer, covered, until all the
moisture is absorbed, about 15 mins. Stir the butter into the barley.
Set aside. Heat the Beef Stock in a large pot and add all the
remaining ingredients, except the garnish. Bring to a simmer and add
the barley/butter mixture, stirring well to separate the grains.
Cook, uncovered, until the barley is tender, about 1 hour. Add salt
and pepper to taste. Garnish with a dollop of sour cream as a garnish.
