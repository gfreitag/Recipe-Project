Name;  Fish Fillets with Tomato and Wine Vinegar Sauce

Pat the fish fillets completely dry with paper towels.  Sprinkle
them on both sides with the salt, coat them with the flour and shake
vigorously to remove the excess.  In a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet,
heat the oil over moderate heat until a light haze forms above it.
Drop 2 or 3 fillets into the hot oil and cook for about 2 minutes
on each side, turning them over with a wide metal spatula.  Transfer
the fillets to paper towel to drain, and fry the remaining fish. Then
arrange them in one layer on a large serving platter.
Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, vinegar, garlic, bay leaf, salt,
and a few grindings of pepper to the oil remaining in the skillet.
Bring to a boil over high heat and, stirring occasionally, cook
briskly until the mixture is thick enough to hold its shape almost
solidly in the spoon. Taste for seasoning.
With a spatula, spread the hot tomato sauce mixture evenly over the
fish and cool to room temperature before serving.  Psari savori is
often accompanied by crusty loaves of fresh bread and a green salad.
