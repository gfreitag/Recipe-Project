Title: Swiss-Style Onion Flatbread
Categories: Bread, West europe
Yield: 28 servings
3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Lightly salted butter
4 c  Diced yellow onions (about 1    2 3/4 ts Salt
1    To 1 1/4 cups cold water
-1/4 lbs)
Chewy rounds of skillet-cooked bread with sauteed onions mixed into
the dough are good as a snack or as a savory accompaniment for soup,
salad or cheese.

Makes abut 28 rounds

*1/4  lb slab bacon

1.  Heat butter in medium skillet over high heat until hot; reduce
heat to medium-high.  Add onions; saute, stirring occasionally, until
soft but not brown, 10 to 15 minutes.  Cool.

2.  Mix 3 cups of the flour and the salt in large bowl.  Add 1 cup of
the water, the onions and their liquid; stir to form a soft dough
(use part or all of the remaining 1/4 cup water if needed). Knead
dough on lightly floured surface to form smooth dough, using as much
of the remaining flour as needed to prevent sticking.

3.  Tear off small pieces of dough, slightly larger than an unshelled
walnut.  Roll on floured surface into 4-inch rounds.

4.  Heat large heavy skillet over medium-high heat; rub with bacon to
coat lightly with fat.  Place as many rounds of bread in skillet as
will fit in single layer; cook until lightly browned on bottom, 5 to
8 minutes. (If breads begin to get too dark, reduce heat.) Turn
rounds and brown the second side, about 8 minutes. Remove breads;
keep warm wrapped in cloth. Repeat, rubbing skillet with bacon as
needed and cooking remaining pieces of dough.  Serve flatbread warm.
