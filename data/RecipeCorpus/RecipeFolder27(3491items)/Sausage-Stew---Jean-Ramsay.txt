Title: Sausage Stew - Jean Ramsay
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Celery, chopped
2 lg Cans of Tomatoes, diced
12 sm Whole new potatoes
8 oz Can Tomato paste
Salt & Pepper
1 lb Mushrooms, cut in half
If desired
1 lb Sausage(Smoked)
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 ts Oregano
1 ts Fennel
2 ts Garlic powder
1 c  Onions, quartered
4 lg Carrots, peeled & Chopped
In a Dutch oven heat oil. add the onions, fennel, garlic, celery
and salt and pepper.  Saute until onions and celery soft and
transluccent. Add remaining ingredients except for the sausage. Cook
for about twenty minutes over low heat.  Add sausage.  Simmer for
another twenty minutes until sausage is heated.

TIP:   Boil Sausage for a few minutes before  adding to the stew.
I puncture the skin of the sausage before adding to the boiling
water to release most of the fat.
