2    Garlic bulbs; whole
12 oz Brie cheese;room temperature
Cocktail bread, crispbread,
French bread; sliced 1/2"
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Remove some of the outer layers from
garlic, but leave bulbs intact.  Place on a baking sheet and bake for
about 40-50 minutes or until cloves are soft. Test with a toothpick
or skewer. To serve, gently separate the cloves and arrange on a
serving plate. Place the Brie on a larger plate, surrounded by the
bread of your choice. Place red pepper strips in a small bowl and
provide a small fork. Each guest should spread Brie on a piece of
bread with a spreading knife, squeeze a garlic clove directly on to
it, then top it with a strip or two of red pepper. You might prepare
a few at first as examples.
