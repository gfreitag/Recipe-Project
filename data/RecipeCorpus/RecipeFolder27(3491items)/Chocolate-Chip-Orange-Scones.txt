1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar,
cocoa, baking powder, and salt. With 2 knives or a pastry cutter, cut
in butter until pastry is crumbly. Stir in chocolate chips and orange
peel.

2. In a small bowl, beat cream and egg yolks with a fork until well
blended, then quickly stir into dry ingredients until dough is soft
and holds together.

3. On a greased foil-lined baking sheet, drop dough by scant 1/4
cupfuls into 12 mounds. Brush with egg white.

4. Bake 13 to 18 mins, or until a toothpick inserted in centers comes
out clean. Do not overbake to avoid drying out scones. Let cool in
pan.

NOTE: Dough can also be prepared in a food processor: Combine flour,
sugar, cocoa, baking powder, and salt. Process to mix. Add butter and
process with on/off motion until mixture is crumbly. Add cream and egg
yolks and process until dough holds together. Stir in chocolate chips
and orange peel. Continue as directed in step 3.
