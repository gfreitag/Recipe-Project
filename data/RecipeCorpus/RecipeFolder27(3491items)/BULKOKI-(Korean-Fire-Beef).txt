Title: BULKOKI (Korean Fire Beef)
Categories: Beef, Asian
Yield: 1 servings
-diagonal
3/4 c  Soy Sauce
1 T  Toasted Sesame Seed
2 c  Beef Broth
1/4 t  Powdered ginger
1/8 t  Sweet basil
2 lb Sirloin Steak
1 md Carrot
1/2 c  Orange Juice
1 t  Sesame Oil
1/4 t  Garlic powder
1/4 t  Black pepper
5 ea To 6 Scallions, sliced
Freeze steak till fairly firm, barely yielding to finger pressure, or
if already frozen remove from freezer about 6 hrs. prior to
preparation time. Cut steak into portions that are about 4" x 3"
(handsize), then turn each piece on its side and slice thin slices
off each portion. BE CAREFUL! In a pie pan, soak steak in marinade
made of garlic powder, ginger, black pepper, sweet basil, soy sauce,
orange juice and sesame oil, for at least 20 min. Mix and dunk the
pieces once or twice, so that all are covered. The carrot needs to be
cut in very thin slices. The way I do this, for this particular dish,
is to first peel the carrot with the potato peeler. Then use the
peeler to peel 1-2" strips of carrot, turning as you go. When the
carrot is peeled down to a skinny strip, where it is too hard to work
with, cut off the skinny end and eat it! Then move your peeler down
to the next section. In restaurants, this is cooked on a special
table top grill. At home, you can stir fry it in a wok or fry pan.
When ready to cook, heat the wok or fry pan a minute (dry) then
remove the beef pieces from the marinade with a fork and toss them
in. Don't worry about trying to drain them. Add the scallions and the
carrot. Stir fry until the beef is just barely pink in a few places,
or however you normally eat your steak (don't overcook). To stop the
beef from cooking beyond desired doneness, toss in the beef broth.
Add 2 to 3 T of the marinade and the sesame seeds, heat just to
serving temperature. Serve with steamed rice.
