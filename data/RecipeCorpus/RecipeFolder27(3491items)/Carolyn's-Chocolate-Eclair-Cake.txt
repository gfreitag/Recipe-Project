Categories: Cake/cookie, Chocolate, Pudding

3 c  Milk
1    8 oz. container Cool Whip
1 cn Milk Chocolate Frosting
1    Box or Whole Graham Crackers
2 sm Boxes of French Vanilla
Instant Pudding
....The Mix.....

Combine pudding, milk and Cool Whip.  Stir until thickened.

....The Layers....

In the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan, place a layer of graham crackers. Pour
1/2 of the mixture on top of the crackers. Place a layer of graham
crackers on top of the mixture. Pour the rest of the mixture on top
of the graham crackers.  Place a layer of graham crackers on top of
the mixture. Spread mixture with milk chocolate frosting.

..THE BIG CHILL..

Chill Over night.

Enjoy!

Comments:  What happens here is, when the mixture chills overnight the
graham crackers are kind of absorbed and the result is a taste just
like chocolate eclairs. On the last layer, I spread the crackers with
the frosting before I put them on the cake and then spread the
balance of the frosting over the top. It was a lot easier.
