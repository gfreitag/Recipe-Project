Title: Shiitake with Bacon and Herbs
Categories: Mushroom, Pork, Herbs/spice
Yield: 2 servings
-finely chopped
2 tb Dry red or white wine
-or dry sherry
Salt and pepper
1 tb Parsley; chopped
1/2 lb Fresh shiitake mushrooms
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1/4 ts Rosemary
1 sl Bacon (thick - 2 oz)
1    Stalk celery
Separate stems from caps. Rinse stems and slice very thinly. Combine
stems in small saucepan with stock and rosemary. Simmer, covered,
until tender, about 10 minutes; do not drain. Meanwhile, clean caps
with a soft brush. Break caps into large bite-sized pieces or leave
whole, as desired.

Cook bacon in a 10-inch heavy skillet (preferably nonstick) over
medium-low heat until barely colored. Drain bacon on paper towels.
Pour off fat; return bacon to skillet. Add celery; increase heat to
medium and stir until softened, about 2 minutes. Add shiitake caps;
toss until barely softened, about 1 minute. Add stems and stock. cook
over medium-high heat until most of the liquid evaporates, about 5
minutes. Pour in wine or sherry, increase heat to high and toss until
the liquid has almost evaporated, about 1 minute. Season with salt
and pepper and sprinkle with parsley.

Note: this basic recipe serves as a prototype, to be modified as
desired; try substituting mushroom stock for  wine, thyme for
rosemary, or adding garlic or shallots.
