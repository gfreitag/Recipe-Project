One that I've been making for a  couple of years it a Berry vinegar.
I give this along with a bottle of good olive oil and it makes a
great gift...so easy to make.  I buy those neat corked bottles from
William Sonoma and fill them one each, stick them in a gift bag, put
a little "fun gift paper" in and under the tree they go.

Berry Vinegar

Put fruit into 6 cup GLASS jar. Sprinkle with sugar then pour on
vinegar. Cover with lid and let stand for 2 weeks. Strain through
double-thickness cheesecloth. Discard fruit. Pour vinegar through
funnel into clean bottles and seal.
