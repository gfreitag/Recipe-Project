Categories: Bread
Yield: 8 servings
-cubes
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped hot
-chilies, fresh or canned
4 oz Can whole-sweet red
-pimentos, roasted 1/2 cut
-into long strips,
Other 1/2 coarsely chunked
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
8 tb Butter
3/4 c  Milk
2 lg Eggs
8 oz Can cream style corn
1 1/4 c  Water ground cornmeal
-(white)
10 oz Sharp cheddar cheese ----
-1/4 cup coarsely grated
Remainder cut into 1/4 inch
In a small saucepan, melt 6 Tbsp. butter over low heat.  Do not brown.
Preheat oven to 400.  Put remaining 2 Tbsp. butter into an 8 inch
diameter baking casserole;  heat in oven no more than 4 to 5 minutes
to avoid browning butter.  Rotate and tilt casserole to coat inside.
Set aside. In large mixing bowl, beat milk and eggs.  Smoothly blend
1 cup white cornmeal, melted butter, corn, diced cheese, chillies,
chopped red pimento, baking soda, salt.  Mix thoroughly.  It should
have the consistency of southern cornbread, moderately runny but not
down right liquid. If it seems to runny work in 1 or 2 tbsp. white
cornmeal. Give butter in casserole a final swizzle, then pour in
batter, smoothing it level. Sprinkle grated cheese over top and
decorate with pimento strips. Do not cover. Place casserole, exactly
in center of oven. Bake until a knife lightly pushed in center comes
out clean and dry- usually 40 to 50 minutes. Serve at once. Cut into
fairly thin, pie - shaped wedges. (You can let the bread cool to room
temperature.) It stores well tightly wrapped in the refrigerator, but
it is best not to serve it cold. One loaf makes about 8 servings.
