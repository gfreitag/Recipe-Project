Title: Knishe Dough
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 36 servings
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Water
1 tb Oil
2 c  Sifted all purpose flour
3    Eggs; well beaten
1 ts Baking powder
Mix all ingredients and form into smooth dough-and roll it to 1/8 inch
thickness OR use WONTON wrappers I have had excellent results. Fill
with anything your heartdesires-my favorite is potato. All you do is
make mashed potatoes, season them to taste, and let them cool. You
may also use kasha-anything! Moisten the edges and fold over the
filling, and press edges together. Place in a pan greased with hot
oil and bake in a 350 oven until brown and crisp. I promise, you will
come out with a product similar to the famous Mrs. Stahl's of
Brooklyn... Lesleigh Hershkowitz FROM:
