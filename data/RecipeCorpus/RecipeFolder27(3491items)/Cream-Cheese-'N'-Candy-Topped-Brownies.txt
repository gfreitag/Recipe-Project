Preparation Time: 0:50 1. Preheat oven to 325 F. To make brownies, in
a 2-qt glass bowl, combine butter and chocolate. Heat in microwave on
High 1 1/2 to 2 mins, until melted and smooth when stirred. Whisk in
granulated sugar, eggs, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, and salt until well mixed.
Whisk in flour until combined. 2. Spread batter evenly in a buttered
8- or 9-inch square baking pan. Bake 30 to 35 mins, or until set. Do
not overbake. Brownies should still be moist. Let cool in pan. 3. In
a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, powdered sugar, and
remaining 1 tsp vanilla until smooth. Spread over cooled brownies.
Sprinkle candy on top. Refrigerate until set, 1 hour or longer. Cut
into 25 squares. Keep refrigerated.

Note: These brownies are also great without topping. Prepare as
directed, adding 1 Tbs instant espresso powder along with sugar to
brownies. Stir in 1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans before spreading in
pan. Proceed and bake as directed above.

NOTES : These brownies are a cross between a brownie and cheesecake.
