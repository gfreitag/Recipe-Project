Title: Holiday Rainbow Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday, Dessert
Yield: 1 servings
2 pk Jello, different colors,
(raspberry, lime, etc.)
1 pk White cake mix, 2-layer size
(3 oz each)
Prepare the cakes according to the directions, using two round cake
pans. When they are baked, leave in pans.  Dissolve the jello in
seperate bowls using only one cup hot water for each one.  Don't add
the second cup of cold water.  Make pencil size holes in the all
ready baked cakes. Pour one color of the jello into one cake, and the
other color in the other cake. Chill in fridge for at least four
hours or until jello is set. Remove from pans, frost with dream whip
or whipped cream and keep in fridge until needed. This one is really
easy to make, and looks like you spent lots of time making it!
