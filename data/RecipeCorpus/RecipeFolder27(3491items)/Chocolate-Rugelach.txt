Preparation Time: 0:37 1. To make chocolate pastry, in a food
processor, combine cream cheese, butter, cocoa, granulated sugar, and
vanilla. Process until smooth. Add flour. Process until well blended
and dough begins to cling together in a ball. Cover and refrigerate
several hours or overnight. 2. Preheat oven to 350 F. In a medium
bowl, combine chocolate chips, walnuts, brown sugar, and cinnamon. 3.
Divide chilled dough into 3 equal portions. On a floured work
surface, roll each portion into an 11- or 12-inch circle. Spread a
third of nut-chocolate chip mixture over each circle of dough. Cut
each circle into 16 equal wedges. Roll up wedges, beginning from wide
end. Press tips to secure. Place rugelach point side down on
ungreased cookie sheets. 4. Bake 15 to 17 mins, or until set. Let
rugelach cool 5 mins on pans, then remove to racks to cool
completely. While warm, sift powdered sugar over tops.
