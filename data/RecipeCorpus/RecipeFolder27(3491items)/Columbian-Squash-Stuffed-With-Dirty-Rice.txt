The Columbian squash used in this recipe may be replaced with a small
pumpkin, as the edible portions are similar in color, taste and
texture. Cut and remove a section of the squash top as if you were
about to carve a "Jack-O-Lantern". Remove the seeds and stringy parts
of the vegetable. Mix the salt and McIlhenney Co. Tabasco sauce and
rub onto the inside of the squash (or pumpkin). Replace the squash
top, and microwave on high for about 5 minutes. While squash is in
the microwave, brown the ground meats, along with the chicken giblets
in a small amount of olive oil in a heavy skillet. When the meats are
browned, drain off excess fat, then add beef stock or water bring to
a boil, add the package of dirty rice mix, return to boil, lower heat
and simmer 5 minutes. Place the mixture into the squash or pumpkin,
replace the top and microwave on high for about 6 minutes per pound
of squash.
