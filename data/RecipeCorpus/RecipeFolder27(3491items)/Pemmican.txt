Title: Pemmican
Categories: Snack, Game
Yield: 1 batch
2 oz Raisins
5 oz Suet
1 lb Jerky (venison, beef, etc)
2 tb Brown sugar
The Indians used pemmican as a trail food.  It keeps well for long
periods of time.

Run dry jerky through a food grinder a few times until it is the
consistency of fine meal.  For each pound of jerky meal, add 2 ounces
of raisins and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  When the mixture is well
blended, melt the suet and stir it in.  The result when the suet
hardens and cools is pemmican.  There are many variations on this
simple theme. Submitted By JANIE YOUNG   On   02-14-95
