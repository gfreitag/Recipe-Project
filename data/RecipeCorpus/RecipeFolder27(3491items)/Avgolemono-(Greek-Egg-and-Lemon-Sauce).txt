Avgolemono is easy to make and creates quit a stir at a formal dinner
party.  It is an almost ethereal sauce, light, foamy, and a beautiful
pale yellow color.  It is a great accompaniment to roasted meat or
chicken, or poached fish, and it is heartily recommended for boiled
artichokes. Add another cup of chicken stock and serve this as a
perfect first course soup.

In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk until lemon
colored and frothy, then beat in the lemon juice until the mixture is
very foamy. Whisk in the hot stock a little at a time until the sauce
is light in color and foamy.  Serve immediately.

Yield: About 2 cups
