Title: Jello Fruit Pie
Categories: Pie/tart, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
2 1/2 T  Cornstarch
1 c  Water
Whipped Creme
4 Cups Fruit (frozen is alright)
3/4 c  Sugar
3 1/2 T  Jello
Flavor of fruit.
Baked Pie Shell
Combine sugar, cornstarch and water in heavy saucepan,  Cook medium
heat until thick and fairly clear.  Remove from heat and add Jello
Mix. Stir until dissolved.  Stir in fruit, pour in shell and chill.
Serve with whipped cream **Use all of a small package of Jello with a
little more juice or water and fill 2 small crusts. **I usually fill
the pie shell with the berries so they all stand up nice. I always
use the entire little box of jello and make a 9 or 10 inch pie. From:
