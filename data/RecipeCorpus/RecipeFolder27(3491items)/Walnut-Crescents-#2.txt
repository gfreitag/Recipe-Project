Title: Walnut Crescents #2
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
2    Egg yolks
1 c  Sweet butter
Confectioners sugar
1 3/4 c  Flour
1/3 c  Sugar
1 1/4 c  Ground walnuts
Legend has it that bakers started making pastry in the form of
crescents following the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683.

Preheat oven to 350Ã¸.

In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar and ground walnuts. Make a little
well in the flour mixture and add the egg yolks. Cut butter into
small pieces and add to the flour mixture. Knead thoroughly and shape
into a ball. Add flour, if needed, to prevent the dough from sticking
to the bowl.

Cut the ball in 4 parts and shape each part in a roll about inch
thick. Cut 1/4-inch pieces and form small crescents in the palm of
your hand. Place crescents on a greased baking sheet and bake about
9-10 minutes, until light brown.

While still warm, roll the crescents in the confectioners sugar (be
careful, they break very easily), then place them on a board to cool.
Store in a cookie tin. The flavor actually improves with time.

Yield: about 3 dozen. Franziska Mayer, Washington, DC
