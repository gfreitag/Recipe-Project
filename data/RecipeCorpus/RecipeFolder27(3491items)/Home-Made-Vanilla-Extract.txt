Categories: Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Water
1 c  Granulated sugar
2    Whole vanilla beans
1 1/2 c  Vodka (the cheap-o stuff
-works just fine)
Anyone interested in a recipe for home-made vanilla extract?  It
makes a fun gift for Christmas, packaged in a small jar with ribbon
around neck, included recipe for same, a bag of brownie or cookie mix
which requires vanilla and a brownie pan.  It IS alcohol-based.
Perhaps someone has another recipe for one that does not require
alcohol? Could this be one of those "chemistry" things again?  I
apologize for typing this in as I still haven't made friends with my
software but folks who know how to doctor it to adapt to their recipe
pgm. will find it a tasty and CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP Holiday idea.
Better start it now, though! It takes about 7 weeks to "steep" it but
you can fudge a little on that timing, I'm sure.

VANILLA EXTRACT

In a 3 cup glass container with a tight fitting lid, combine vanilla
beans with the vodka.  Cap and allow to "steep" at room temperature
for three weeks.  Remove vanilla beans and strain liquid through a
cheesecloth, if necessary.  In a medium saucepan, combine water and
sugar, stirring constantly, until it comes to a boil and sugar
dissolves. Remove from heat and cool.  Stir into vodka that has been
strained. Pour mixture into a bottle; cap and allow to sit at room
temperature one month. Yield:2 cups vanilla extract
