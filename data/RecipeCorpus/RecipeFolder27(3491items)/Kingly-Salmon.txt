MMMMM-------------------------KINGLY RUB------------------------------
Kingly Mop (optional)
Remainder of Kingly Rub
1 c  Cider vinegar
1/4 c  Oil, preferably canola or
-corn
Serves 8
1/4 c  Dried dill
1/4 c  Brown sugar

2 t  Fresh ground black pepper
3 lb To 3-1/2 pound salmon tail

The night before, combine the rub ingredients.  Open the fish flat
and rub spice mix into the opened fish using about 2/3's of the rub.
Fold the salmon back to the original and place in a plastic bag and
refrigerate overnight. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing
the temperature to 180 to 200 F. Remove the salmon from the
refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. If you
plan to mop, make it up and warm it in a saucepan over low heat.
Transfer the salmon to the smoker, skin side down, placing the fish
as far from the heat as possible. Cook for 50 to 60 minutes, mopping
it after 10 and 30 minutes or as appropriate. It should flake easily
when done. It will fall apart easily. From: Smoke & Spice by Cheryl
