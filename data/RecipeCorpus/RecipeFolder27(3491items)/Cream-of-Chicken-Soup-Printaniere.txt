Put the vegetables, chicken, vermouth, and 3 cups of chicken stock in

as necessary, until the chicken is just lightly springy to the touch.
Remove the chicken and let the vegetables simmer for 5 minutes or
more until tender. Correct the seasoning and remove the pan from the
heat.

While the vegetables finish cooking, cut the chicken breasts
lengthwise into julienne strips. Add the chicken to the vegetables
and let steep for several minutes or longer to pick up the aromatic
flavors. Add the Rice and Onion Soup Base to the saucepan and bring
just to a simmer. Taste very carefully and correct the seasoning.
Remove from the heat. Ladle the soup into warm bowls and top each
serving with a dollop of sour cream or crme frache (optional) and a
sprinkling of parsley.

Variation: for Cream of Mushroom Soup, make the Rice and Onion Base
with 1 cup chicken broth and 6 cups of milk. Meanwhile, dice 1 quart
of fresh mushrooms. After pureeing the base, bring it to a simmer and
fold in the mushrooms and 1 sprig of tarragon (or 1/4 tsp dried).
simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in « cup or so of
sour cream, simmer a moment more and carefully correct the seasoning,
adding a few drops of lemon juice if needed.
