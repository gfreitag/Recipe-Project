Categories: Pork, Nuts/grains, Rice dishes
Yield: 3 servings
1 pk Onion soup mix
3 ea Pork Steaks
1 1/2 c  Water
1 c  Rice, Uncooked
1 cn Cream of Mushroom soup
Mix water, rice and soups.  Pour into large baking pan. Place 3 each
Pork steaks on top of rice mixture. Bake 1 hour in 350 degree oven
covered with foil. Uncover, bake 1/2 hour.

MY NOTES: Cream of celery soup makes an interesting change from cream
of mushroom. Also, substitute cream of chicken soup, and
boneless,skinless chicken breasts for the pork.
