Categories: Bread, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Lemon juice
1    Lemon's rind, grated
3/4 c  Blanched almonds, chopped
TOPPING:
1/4 c  Sugar
Juice of one large lemon
1 1/2 c  Flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Butter or margarine
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3    Eggs
3/4 c  Milk
Bread:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease and flour 9x5x3-inch loaf pan.
In bowl, sift flour, baking powder, and salt together; set aside.

In large mixing bowl, cream butter/margarine and sugar until fluffy.
Add eggs 1 by 1.  In 3 equal batches, alternately add dry ingredients
and milk. Stir in 2 tablespoons lemon juice and rind. Fold in nuts.
Pour batter into prepared loaf pan, spreading evenly with rubber
spatula. Bake 1 hour and test for doneness. (During last 15 minutes,
cover loosely with aluminum foil, if necessary to prevent bread from
becoming too brown.)

Meanwhile, in bowl, combine 1/4 cup sugar and juice of 1 lemon,
stirring with fork until sugar is dissolved.

Leave bread in pan and place on wire cooling rack.  Make tiny holes
in top of bread with toothpick.  Pour lemon/sugar mixture slowly
across top, giving time for topping to be absorbed into warm loaf.
Allow 15 minutes to set.  Remove bread from pan and finish cooking on
wire rack. Makes 1 loaf.
