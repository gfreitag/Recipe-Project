Title: Pecan Cashew Popcorn Balls
Categories: Snack, Holiday, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Butter
2 c  Pecan halves; toasted
2 c  Cashews; lightly toasted
8 c  Popped popcorn
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Brown sugar; firm pack
1 c  Light corn syrup
2/3 c  Water
Combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup and water in a
heavy pan fitted with a candy thermometer and place over high heat.
Bring mixture to a boil and add the butter, stirring until it has
melted. Continue cooking until the mixture reached 350~, 20-30
minutes. In a LARGE, lightly oiled bowl, toss the nuts and popcorn
together. Carefully pour the hot syrup over the popcorn- nut mixture.
Carefully, but quickly, toss the mixture with a long-handled wooden
spoon to coat the popcorn and nuts completely with syrup. As soon as
the mixture is cool enough to handle, quickly shape into 3" balls and
place the balls onto a nonstick or lightly oiled baking sheet to
coool. Store, tightly wrapped, in a cool place. Wrap popcorn balls
individually in squares of amber cellophane, tied up with gold or
orange and black ribbon (these are meant for Halloween). Or pile the
balls together into a basket with red apples and wrap the basket up
in cellophane with orange and black ribbon. Or place the balls in a
brown paper bag and tie with a ribbon.
