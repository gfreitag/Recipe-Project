surface, roll out bread dough with a rolling pin to a 12 x 18-inch

chips, melted butter, lemon zest, walnuts, and currants. Spread over
dough to within 3/4 inch of edges. Starting from a long side, roll up
dough jelly-roll fashion. Pinch edges to seal. 2. Carefully lift roll

to hold together. Let rise in a draft-free area about 45-60 mins, or
until doubled in size. 3. About 15 mins. before rising is completed,
preheat oven to 350°F. Bake 30 to 35 mins. Let cool on baking sheet.

cream and remaining 1 Tbs butter. Heat in a microwave on High 1 to 1

smooth when stirred. Let chocolate glaze cool slightly before using.
