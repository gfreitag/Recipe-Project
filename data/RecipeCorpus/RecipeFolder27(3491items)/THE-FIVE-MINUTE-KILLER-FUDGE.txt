Title: THE FIVE MINUTE KILLER FUDGE
Categories: Candy, Chocolate
Yield: 16 servings
1 1/2 c  Semi-sweet Chocolate Chips
1 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Nuts
2/3 c  Evaporated Milk
1 2/3 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Miniature Marshmallows
Read all of the instructions before starting.  Wise advice would be
to have the ingredients in the 3rd paragraph ready to go, and also
the pan already buttered.  Do all of this BEFORE you begin to cook.

Combine Milk, Sugar, and Salt in saucepan over medium heat Bring to a
boil and cook 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly (start timing when the
mixture starts to "bubble" around the corners of the pan). Remove
from heat. Add Marshmallows, Chocolate Chips, Nuts and Vanilla. Stir
vigorously for 1 minute (or until Marshmallows are completely melted
and blended).

Pour into a buttered 8" square pan.  Cool until it doesn't fall out or
slosh around in pan.  Eat!

For the totally inept in the kitchen (or kids):

Don't leave out ingredients...So what if you can't find the vanilla.
If you leave it out, the fudge will taste about the same, but it will
be hard enough to use as asphalt patch. You'll ruin the pan using a
chisel to get the fudge out...Don't overcook!...Mix well! You should
end up with a uniform texture about the same appearance as Hershey's
Syrup... It has to cool before it turns solid...Buttering the pan
means putting just a little butter or margarine on a clean piece of
paper toweling and rubbing the bottom of the pan with it. Pretend
your waxing the car.
