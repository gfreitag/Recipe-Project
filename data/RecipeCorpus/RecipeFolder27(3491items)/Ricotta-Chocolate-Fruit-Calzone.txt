combine ricotta cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and cream. Beat with
electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and almost smooth, 1

lightly floured pastry cloth and trim corners of each to make a 9- to

ricotta filling mixture on half of each pastry round to within 1 inch
of edges. Top each with half of strawberry slices. With a pastry
brush or fingers, spread some of beaten egg around edges of pastry.
Fold pastry round in half like a turnover to form a half-moon shape.
