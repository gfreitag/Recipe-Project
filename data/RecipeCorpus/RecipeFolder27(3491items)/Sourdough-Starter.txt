Categories: Bread
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Sugar
4 c  Flour
1    Raw potato, quartered
1    Cake or envelope of dry
-yeast
4 c  Warm water
Dissolve yeast in warm water, and then mix all ingredients in a one
gallon crock. (Do not use a metal container.) Cover with a
close-fitting lid and let the starter rise until light (12 hours in
warm weather, longer in cool weather). Do not let the starter get
cold, ever. After using part of the starter, add one cup warm water,
two teaspoons sugar, and enough flour to mix to the starter's
original consistency. Add more potato occasionally as food for the
yeast, but don't add more yeast. Use daily for best results. Starter
improves with age.
