Preheat oven to 350 F.  Beat eggs well.  Add sugar, beating
continuously. Add remaining milk, lemon extract, vanilla and butter.

Combine rice and milk with egg mixture and pour into 8x8-inch pan.
Sprinkle with nutmeg.  Place pan in larger pan, taking care that
sides of smaller pan do not touch larger pan.  Bake until custard
begins to set, about 30 minutes.  Stir in raisins and continue baking
until knife inserted in center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.
Remove from oven and set custard pan on cake rack.  Cool slightly
before refrigerating.
