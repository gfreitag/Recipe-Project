Title: Company Chicken Roll-Ups
Categories: Mixes, Chicken, Mushroom, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 8 servings
Flour
1 t  Salt
1    Egg, slightly beaten
1 c  Milk
2 c  Dry breadcrumbs
Oil for frying
1/2 c  White sauce mix
1 c  Cool water
1 c  Grated cheddar cheese
4 oz Sliced mushrooms, drained
6    Whole chicken breasts,
Skinned and boned
In a small saucepan, combine white sauce mix with cool water. Cook
over low heat until thick and smooth, stirring constantly. Add grated
cheddar cheese and mushrooms. Stir until cheese is melted. Pour into
8" square pan. Chill until set.  Lay large pieces of chicken breasts
on a generously floured surface with sides just touching. Fill in any
gaps with small pieces of chicken.  Sprinkle generously with flour.
Cover with plastic wrap and pound together with a wooden mallet. Roll
lightly with a rolling pin to form a rectangular shape, about 8 by
20.  Remove plastic wrap. Sprinkle with salt. Cut cheese mixture in
1/2 to 3/4" strips. Lay about half of the cheese strips along the
long edge of chicken.  Carefully wrap chicken around cheese mixture
and roll up lengthwise like a jelly roll. With a sharp knife, cut
into 2 to 3" pieces. Combine egg and milk in a shallow dish. Dip
chicken pieces in egg mixture, then in breadcrumbs. Place on a wire
rack to dry out, about 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 350. Fry chicken
in hot oil aobut 1 minute on each side, until golden.  Place in a 9 x
13 baking pan. Cover and bake 45 minutes, until chicken is tender.
Melt remaining cheese mixture and serve over chicken rolls.  Note:
After chicken has been breaded, it can be loosely covered and
refigerated for a day, then cooked the next day. Breaded chicken
rolls can also be frozen on a baking sheet, then stored in freezer
bag. Thaw several hours, then fry and bake as directed.
