Peel the oranges, remove the pith and pips, slice the flesh and
finely chop the peel.  Core and chop the apples.  Drain and chop the
ginger. Put the oranges, apples, orange juice, ginger, currants,
chilli, salt and pepper into a saucepan.  Cover and simmer until the

will take about an hour. Put into clean, warm jars and cap with
plastic-lined lids.

it with cold poultry or soft white cheese or with cream cheese on
brown bread.
