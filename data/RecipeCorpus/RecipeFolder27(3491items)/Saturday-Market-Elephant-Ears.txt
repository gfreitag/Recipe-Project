Title: Saturday Market Elephant Ears
Categories: Bread
Yield: 12 servings
4 c  Flour
6 tb Sugar
1 pk Dry yeast
1 c  Warm water
2    Eggs beaten
Servings: 12

Sugar and cinnamon mix - set aside

Soften yeast in warm water.  Combine all ingredients except the
cinnamon sugar  mix.  Mix well.  Divide dough into 12 pieces. Let sit
10 minutes. Roll out on a lightly floured board. Using hands, stretch
each piece into circular shape. Heat vegetable oil in 10 skillet
(cast iron is best). Place each circle of dough in the hot grease.
Turn once - the surface will bubble and blister and should be lightly
browned.  Turn with spatula and broad knife.  Place on absorbent
paper toweling. Sprinkle immediately with mix of sugar and cinnamon.
If you tear a hole in the circle as it is being stretched that will
not matter.

This will be a favorite for all ages.  The recipe has been around a
long time, but each time we make them someone has never heard of
individuals making them.
