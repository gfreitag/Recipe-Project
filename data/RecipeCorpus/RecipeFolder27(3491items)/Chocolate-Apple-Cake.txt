Preparation Time: 1:30

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Generously grease a 12-cup bundt pan.

2. In a large bowl, beat together oil, butter, and granulated sugar
with an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended, about 2
mins. With mixer on low, beat in cocoa, 1 tsp cinnamon, nutmeg, and
allspice. With mixer on medium, add eggs, one at a time, beat well
after each addition.

3. Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt. Add to chocolate
mixture, beating only enough to combine. Stir in apples and currants.
Turn batter into prepared pan and spread evenly.

4. Bake 55 to 60 mins, or until a cake tester inserted in center
comes out clean. Let cool in pan 20 mins, then unmold onto a rack to
cool completely.

5. Meanwhile, prepare glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together powdered
sugar, remaining 1 tsp cinnamon, and brandy until smooth. Drizzle over
cool cake, letting some run down side. Serve warm or at room
temperature.
