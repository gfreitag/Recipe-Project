PLACE THE BEANS IN A SIEVE and wash them well under cold running
water, picking through them to clean. Either soak them in cold water
to cover overnight, or bring them to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, then
remove from heat and allow them to stand covered for 1 hour. Either
tie the cinnamon stick, garlic and peppercorns in cheesecloth, or
break the cinnamon stick into small pieces and place all the
flavoring agents in a tea ball. Bring the beans to a boil and simmer,
covered, for 30 minutes, or until they are cooked but still slightly
crunchy. Drain and chill well. Combine the beans with the papaya and
jicama. For the dressing, peel and mince the garlic and shallots.
Combine them in a small bowl with the remaining ingredients. Combine
the dressing with the jicama, papaya and beans. Let the salad sit
refrigerated for at least 20 minutes before serving. Serves 6. (If
you can't find jicama, you can use peeled apple.)
