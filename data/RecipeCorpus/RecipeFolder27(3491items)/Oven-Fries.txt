Categories: Kids, Side dish, Low-cal/fat, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1/8 ts Onion powder
1/8 ts Pepper
1/8 ts Chili powder
2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
4 lg Baking potatoes, unpeeled
1 tb Vegetable oil
Salt
1/2 ts Oregano
Preheat the oven to 450F. Slice the potatoes to form french fries.
Place the potatoes in a plastic bag with the oil and shake. Add the
salt, oregano, onion powder, pepper, chili powder, and cheese, and
shake again. Spread out the potatoes, so that they are close but not
touching, on a large cookie sheet with sides. Bake for 20 to 30
minutes, turning a few times, until the fries are crisp. *By Trudy
