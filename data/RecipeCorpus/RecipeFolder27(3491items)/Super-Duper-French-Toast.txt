Title: Super Duper French Toast
Categories: Breakfast, Bread, French
Yield: 6 servings
1    Loaf French Bread
Butter, margarine or cooking
-oil
Powdered sugar
6    Eggs, slightly beaten
1/2 pt (1 cup) whipping cream
1 c  Orange juice
1    To 1 1/2 ounces Orange
-Liqueur
*  Mix eggs, whipping cream and orange juice.  Then add liqueur to
taste. Pour into large casserole or glass baking dish.

Remove ends from the bread and cut loaf into 12-15 slices, each about
3/4" thick.  Place slices in egg mixture and let stand for a few
minutes to absorb some of the liquid; then turn so the other side of
the bread can absorb some of the mixture. Cover tightly with plastic
wrap and refrigerate until you are ready to prepare the French Toast.
Some cooks soak the bread in the egg mixture overnight, refrigerated
so that it becomes almost custardlike in texture.

*

Preheat heavy skillet or electric griddle to 325-350 degrees. Melt
butter, margarine or place oil in skillet.  Place four or five slices
in to cook, but do not crowd.  Cook on one side until golden brown,
turn and cook on the other side.  Remove and keep warm while you cook
remaining slices, adding more oil or butter as needed. Place toast on
serving plates and dust with powered sugar.  Garnish with fresh
fruit, if desired, and serve with honey, jam or syrup of your choice.
Yields 4-5 Serv.
