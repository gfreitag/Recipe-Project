Hi Scott, hi Stacy!  Know you love desserts, so I thought I'd share
this fabulous recipe from Bon Appetit with you. Granted, it is a bit
time-consuming, but should keep you busy - and...it is so worth the
wait. Whisk yolks, 6 tablespoons sugar, and Marsala in large metal
bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not
allow water to touch bottom of bowl).  Using portable electric mixer
beat until mixture triples in volume about 5 minutes. Cover
zabaglione and refrigerate until well chilled.  (Can be prepared 2
days ahead). Place mascarpone in large bowl. Using electric mixer
whip cream with 2 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl to soft peaks.
Fold into mascarpone. Gently fold in zabaglione. Refrigerate until
well chilled about 3 hours. Combine espresso coffee, rum, 3
tablespoons sugar, and vanilla in small bowl. Brush over both sides
of cake pieces.  Place generous tablespoon mascarpone mixture in
bottom of each of 8 balloon-shaped wineglasses. Set cake square or
wedge into each at angle. Top with remaining mascarpone mixture.
Combine shaved chocolate and ground coffee

desserts.  Refrigerate until chilled at least 30 minutes and up to 3
hours. NOTE:  Instead of 12x6x1 layer sponge cake cut into eight 3
squares you may use a 9 round sponge cake cut into 8 wedges. Take all
the time you need to enjoy this scrumptious recipe! Rita in ever so
sunny and beautiful Scottsdale....02/22/92
