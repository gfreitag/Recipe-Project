MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
1    Egg
METHOD: Have all your meat and vegetables cut and ready to go.

Put broth/water and soy sauce in a pan to bring to a boil. In another
dutch oven (cast iron preferable) place raw rice and vegetable oil to
roast till brown and puffy, stirring most of the time so it doesn't
burn. Ideally liquid comes to a boil at same time rice is brown and
puffy. Pour the broth/water/soy sauce mixture over the very hot rice
very slowly (much spluttering) don't get burned. Add the vegetables
that need the most cooking at this time i.e. the celery and
scallions. Cover tightly and simmer for about 10 minutes. Lift cover
and put in the rest of the ingredients, stir and cover tightly once
more. Continue simmering for another 5 to 10 minutes till liquid is
absorbed, vegies are crunchy tender, rice is tender and all is hot.
Place in warm serving dish.

GARNISH: Beat egg well. Heat a small, nonstick skillet, add the egg
(swirl, much like a crepe) cook (without stirring) till the egg is
set and the top almost cooked too. Remove from the pan, cool slightly
and roll up. Cut into 1/4" "noodles". Spread over the top of the dish.
