Title: Sana Pakoras
Categories: Appetizer, Indian, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 ts Indian chili powder
1/4 c  Water
1 c  Minced onion
2/3 c  Finely diced boiling potato
2 tb Finely diced tomato
Vegetable oil
1 c  Besan (chick-pea flour)
2 tb Chopped cilantro
1 tb Dried pomegranate seeds
-- (half-crushed)
1    Serrano chili; minced
1 tb Coriander seeds
1 ts Salt
In a large bowl, mix together besan, cilantro, pomegranate seeds,
chili, coriander seeds, salt and chili powder.  Blend in enough water
to make a thick batter.  Stir in onion, potato and tomato.

In a deep fryer or heavy large saucepan, heat oil to 350 degrees F.
Fry heaping tablespoons of the batter in batches until golden, about
2 minutes. (Take care not to crowd the pakoras while cooking.)
Remove from oil and drain pakoras on paper towels.

Increase oil temperature to 400 F.  Refry pakoras until crisp and
edges are brown, taking care not to crowd, about 1 minute.  Remove
from oil and drain on paper towels.  Can be prepared up to 3 hours
ahead. Serve at room temperature or reheat in a 250 F oven.  Serve
with cilantro and mint chutney.
