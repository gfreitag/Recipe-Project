1. Preheat oven to 275Â°F. In a medium bowl, beat egg whites with
cream of tartar and salt with an electric mixer on medium until stiff
peaks form. Turn mixer to high and gradually beat in sugar. Add
vanilla and beat until glossy, stiff peaks form.

2. Spread meringue in a greased 9-inch pie pan, building up sides.
Bake 60 to 70 mins, until meringue is cream colored. Turn oven off;
leave in oven with door ajar 1 hour. Remove from oven and let cool to
room temperature.

3. When shell is cool, fill with Chocolate Chantilly. Refrigerate
until chilled, 2 to 3 hours.

NOTES : Classic ---light and easy. Use up extra egg whites to make
this
shell. The Chantilly filling is a rich mousse chocolate, made
without eggs.
