Title: Grandma Rose's Blueberry Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Fruit
Yield: 12 servings
1 ts VANILLA
1 c  MILK
2 c  FLOURED BLUEBERRIES
2 tb SUGAR
1 ts CINNAMON
1/2 lb SOFTENED BUTTER
2 c  SUGAR
4    EGGS
3 c  SIFTED FLOUR
3 ts BAKING POWDER
1/2 ts SALT
MIX TOGETHER BUTTER, 2 CUPS SUGAR, 4 EGGS, BAKING POWDER, SALT,
VANILLA AND MILK. ADD FLOUR AND MIX WELL. FOLD IN THE FLOURED
BLUEBERRIES. LINE A 9" X 13" PAN WITH ALUMINUM FOIL. POUR THE BATTER
INTO THE PAN AND SPRINKLE THE TOP WITH MIXTURE OF 2TB SUGAR AND 1 TS
CINNAMON. PREHEAT OVEN TO 350. BAKE FOR 45 MINUTES. REMOVE FROM PAN.
ALLOW TO COOL BEFORE REMOVING ALUMINUM FOIL. NOTE: COATING THE
BLUEBERRIES WITH FLOUR STOPS THEM FROM SINKING IN THE
BATTER. THE ALUMINUM FOIL PREVENTS THE CAKE FROM PULLING APART
IF ANY OF THE BERRIES STICK, THIS PROVES OUT TO BE BETTER THAN
GREESING THE PAN. GOOD LUCK, GRANDMA ROSE.
