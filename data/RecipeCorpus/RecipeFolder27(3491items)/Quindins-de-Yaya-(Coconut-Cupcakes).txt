Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).  In a large mixing bowl, beat
the 4 tablespoons of butter, sugar, orange flower water, cloves and
cinnamon together with a large spoon, mashing and beating against the
side of the bowl until the mixture is light and fluffy.  Beat in the
egg yolks one at a time and then the egg whites, beating vigorously
until the batter is smooth.  Add the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, and
continue to beat until all the flour has been absorbed.  Then stir in
the coconut. With a pastry brush, liberally coat the insides of two
12 cup muffin tins with melted butter.  Pour enough batter into each
cup to fill it about halfway.
Place the filled muffin tins in one or two large shallow baking
pans and pour in enough boiling water to reach at least halfway up
the side of the tins.  Bake the cupcakes in the middle of the oven
for 40 minutes, until they are slightly brown on top.  Let them cool
to room temperature, then run a small, sharp knife around the inside
rim of each muffin tin, invert the pans, and turn the cupcakes out
onto a rack to cool.
