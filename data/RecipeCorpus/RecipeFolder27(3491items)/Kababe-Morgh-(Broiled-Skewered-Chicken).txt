Title: Kababe Morgh (Broiled Skewered Chicken)
Categories: Middle east, Chicken
Yield: 4 servings
1/8 ts Ground saffron; (or 1/8 tsp.
;saffron threads pulverized
;with a mortar/pestle or the
;back of a spoon) dissolved
;in 1 tablespoon of warm
;water
1 c  Onion; finely grated
1/2 c  Lemon juice, fresh
2 ts Salt
2    Chickens; (2 pounds each),
;each cut into 8 serving
;pieces
4 tb Butter; melted
In a stainless steel, enameled or glass bowl combine the onion,
lemon juice and salt, stirring until they are thoroughly blended. Add
the chicken and turn the pieces about with a spoon to coat them well.
Marinate at room temperature for at least 2 hours or in the
refrigerator for 4 hours, turning the pieces over occasionally.
Light a layer of coals in a charcoal broiler and let them burn
until a white ash appears on the surface or preheat the stove broiler
to its highest point.
Remove the chicken from the marinade and string the pieces tightly
on 4 long skewers, pressing them together firmly.  If you are
broiling the chicken in an oven, suspend the skewers side by side
across the length of a large roasting pan deep enough to allow about
1 inch of space under the meat.
Stir the melted butter and dissolved saffron into the marinade and
brush the chicken evenly on all sides with 2 or 3 tablespoons of the
mixture. Broil about 3 inches from the heat for 10 to 15 minutes
turning the skewers occasionally and basting the chicken frequently
with the remaining marinade.  The chicken is done if the juices that
trickle out are yellow rather than pink when a thigh is pierced with
the point of a small, sharp knife.
Serve at once.  Kababe morgh is traditionally accompanied by chelo
and may be garnished, if you like, with tiny, whole cherry tomatoes.
