Cook the shrimp in the water and wine with a pinch of salt for 2
minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, and when cool enough to handle,
remove the shells. Reserve the cooking liquid. Chop the shrimp into
very small pieces, and mix with the scallions, tarragon, ginger, red
pepper, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Place equal portions
of this filling on each of the fillets, and roll them up. Place flap
side down, in a flameproof dish just large enough to accomodate the
rolled fillets comfortably, sprinkle them with salt and pepper, and
then pour the reserved shrimp cooking liquid over and around them.
Bring to a simmer on top of the stove, then cover loosely with foil
and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 10 minutes.
