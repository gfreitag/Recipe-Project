1 pk Active dry yeast
-or 1 scant tb. bulk yeast
1/4 c  Tepid water

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 1/2 ts Cinnamon

1/2 ts Vanilla
Disolve the yeast in the warm water in a large bowl. Stir in the
milk, 1/4 cup of the sugar, the shortening, egg and salt. Mix with a
spoon till smooth. Mix in enough of the flour to make the dough easy
to handle, but still slightly sticky and soft. . Turn out onto a
lightly floured board and knead till smooth and elastic, about 8 to
10 minutes. Let the dough rest while you while you wash the mixing
bowl, dry and grease it with shortening. Put the dough into the bowl,
turning to grease the top. (At this point, the dough can be covered
and refrigerated 3-4 days, punching it down when it gets too big for
the bowl.) Cover and let rise in a warm place until double, about 1
1/2 hours. (Dough is ready when an indentation remains when touched.)
Punch the dough down and roll it into a rectangle 12x9 inches. Spread
the rectangle with the softened butter and mix the 1/4 cup sugar, the
cocoa, and the cinnamon together (also the optional pecans)
sprinkling it over the buttered dough when done. Roll up, beginning
at the 12" side and when fully rolled up, pinch the seam to seal. cut
the roll into 12 even slices and place in a lightly greased baking
pan 9x9x2". Cover and let rise until double (about 40 minutes). Heat
the oven to 375 degrees. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes (checking after 20
minutes to see if the rolls are getting too dark at which time you
could cover lightly with a piece of foil till finished baking. Spread
with powdered sugar frosting while still warm.
