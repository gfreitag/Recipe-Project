Categories: Breakfast, Vegetable, Doughnut
Yield: 30 doughnuts
1 c  Milk, scalded
4 1/2 c  To 5 cups hot roll mix
Vegetable oil for frying
Vanilla glaze (see swedish
Cinnamon twists)
1 T  Yeast
1/2 c  Lukewarm water
2    Eggs, beaten
1/2 c  Melted butter or margarine
3 T  Sugar
1/2 c  Instant potato flakes
Lightly grease two baking sheets.  In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in
lukewarm water.  Stir in eggs and butter or margarine.  Add sugar,
potato flakes and milk.  Blend well.  Add 4 1/2 cups of hot roll mix
and stir thoroughly.  Add additional hot roll mix to make a soft, but
not too sticky dough.  Turn out on a lightly floured surface.  Knead
about 5 minutes until dough is smooth and satiny.  Lightly butter
bowl.  Put dough in bowl and turn to butter top.  Cover dough and let
rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  Punch down.  On a
lightly floured surface, roll dough out about 1/4" thick.  Cut with a
floured doughnut cutter. Place on prepared baking sheets.  Cover and
let rise until doubled in bulk, about 30 to 40 minutes.  In a deep
fryer or electric skillet heat 1/2" of oil to 375. Fry doughnuts
about 1 minute on each side, until golden brown. Drain on paper
towels.  While still warm, brush with vanilla glaze. Submitted By MEG
