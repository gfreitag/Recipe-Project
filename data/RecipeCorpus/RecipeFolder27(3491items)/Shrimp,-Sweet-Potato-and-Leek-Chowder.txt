Make the stock: heat the oil in a heavy medium saucepan. Add the
onion and chile and cook over moderately high heat, stirring
occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the clam juice,
shrimp shells, tomato paste and 1 cup of water and bring to a boil
over high heat. Reduce the heat to moderate and simmer for 20
minutes. Strain the stock into a large heatproof measuring cup. You
should have 4 cups of stock; boil to reduce if necessary.

Make the soup: Set a large saucepan over moderately high heat until
hot. Add the bacon and cook, stirring, until crisp, about 4 minutes.
With a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain.
Stir in the leeks, onion, celery and garlic and cook, stirring
occasionally, until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Add the
shrimp stock and sweet potato and simmer over moderately low heat
until the sweet potato is tender, about 20 minutes.

Add the shrimp and the bacon and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the milk
and paprika, season with salt and pepper and heat through; do not let
the chowder boil or it will curdle. Ladle the soup into warmed soup
plates and garnish with the chives.
