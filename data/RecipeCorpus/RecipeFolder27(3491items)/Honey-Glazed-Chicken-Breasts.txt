Categories: Poultry
Yield: 8 servings
1 ts Rosemary
10 3/4 oz Condensed chicken broth
1 c  Water
4    12 oz chicken breasts
1/3 c  Honey
Green grapes optional
Watercress optional
1/4 c  Almonds, sliced
1    Medium onion, sliced
1    Stalk celery sliced
1    Carrot sliced
1    Sprig parsley
1    Small bayleaf
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
The day ahead, arrange sliced almonds in a single layer in a shallow
baking pan.  Broil 1 minute or until almonds are golden brown. Watch
as almonds burn very quickly. May have to stir them several times.
Transfer and cover for next day.

In a 6 qt. kettle, combine onion, celery, carrot, parsley, salt,
pepper, rosemary, bay leaf, undiluted chicken broth and water. Bring
mixture to a boil and add the chicken breasts and cover. Simmer 30
minutes or until chicken is tender.  Remove from heat and place
immediately in the refrigerator to chill overnight.

Next day, place chicken mixture over low heat and cook until chicken
is heated through, about 10 minutes. Remove chicken from broth and
place skin side up in a large, shallow baking pan. Spoon 1 cup
chicken broth into the pan.  Strain remaining broth; discard
vegetables and save broth for use in other recipes for soups or
stews. Using a pastry brush, brush chicken with half of the honey.
Broil, 4 inches from heat source, for 2 minutes. Brush again with
honey and broil until hicken is glazed and golden brown.

Remove chicken from broiler and arrange the honey-glazed breasts on a
heated platter.  Sprinkle with sliced almonds and garnish, if
desired, with green grapes and crisp watercress. Serve immediately.
