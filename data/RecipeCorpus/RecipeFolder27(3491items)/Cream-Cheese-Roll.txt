Title: Cream Cheese Roll
Categories: Bread, Breakfast
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Warm water (110 degrees)
2    Eggs, beaten
4 1/2    To 4 3/4 cups all-purpose or
-bread flour
1 c  Sour cream
1/2 c  Softened margarine or butter
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
2 pk Active dry yeast
Heat sour cream and margarine on low heat until margarine starts to
melt. Stir in sugar and salt.  In large bowl, sprinkle yeast in warm
water, stirring until yeast dissolves.  Add sour cream mixture, eggs
and 4 cups flour.  Stir, adding additional flour until dough is not
sticky. Knead for 3-4 minutes on lightly floured surface until dough
is smooth. This is a very soft dough.

Place in greased bowl, turning once.  (Dough may be refrigerated
overnight and made into rolls the next day.)  Let rise 30 minutes.

FILLING: 3/4 cups sugar 2 packages (8-oz) cream cheese, room
temperature 1 egg, beaten 1/8 tsp salt 2 tsp vanilla

Prepare filling by creaming sugar with cream cheese; add egg, salt and
vanilla.

Divide dough into 8 equal parts.  Roll each on floured surface into 8
x 6 inch rectangle.  Spread 1/8 of cream cheese filling on each. Roll
up beginning with long side.  Pinch edges and fold ends under
slightly. Place rolls seam side down on bakng sheet coated with
non-stick spray. With kitchen shears, cut each roll diagonally at 2
inch intervals, 2/3 of the way through roll to resemble braid.

Cover; let rise in warm place until double the size, approximately one
hour.  Bake at 375 degrees for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
While warm, may be spread with a glaze of:

1  cup powdered sugar 1 tsp vanilla 1 1/2 to 2 Tbsp milk
