Title: Whole Wheat Croissants
Categories: Bread
Yield: 24 servings
1 1/2 tb Honey
2 c  Butter, 1/2" pieces
1    Egg
1 tb Water
2 tb Yeast
3/4 c  Water, warm
1 3/4 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
1/2 c  Water
Combine yeast and warm water, stirring a little to dissolve yeast.
Let sit about 10 minutes.  Add 1/2 of flour; add water and honey;
whisk until smooth.  Cover bowl and let stand 1 1/2 hours.

Combine remaining flour with butter, and flatten butter pieces.  Pour
yeast batter into flour mixture; fold together with spatula; just
moisten flour without breaking butter pieces.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface.  Pat dough down and roll
into a 18" x 12" rectangle; if too sticky, sprinkle with flour. Use a
metal spatula to fold 1/3 of dough toward center; then fold from
other side, 1/3 of dough over first 1/3. Lift folded dough off work
surface, and scrape surface clean. Sprinkle work area with flour and
repeat, rolling and folding 3 more times. Dough must be hard; if not,
freeze for 45 minutes.

Pat dough into rectangle.  Cut into parts, 1 part for each 4
croissants. For instance, for 24 croissants:  cut in 1/2 lengthwise,
then cut each half into 3 pieces, for a total of 6 (4x6=24).  Work
with one piece at a time, holding others in refrigerator until ready
to use.  Roll each piece individually into 5 1/2" x 14" rectangles.
Cut into two 5 1/2" x 7" pieces. Cut each piece diagonally to form 4
triangles; roll from wide end to point. Place on ungreased cookie
sheets. Curve ends to crescent shape.

Beat egg with water; brush croissants with this and set them aside 1
hour. Reglaze with egg/water mixture.  Bake at 375 degrees until
puffed and brown. Let cool slightly and serve.
