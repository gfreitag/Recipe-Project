Preparation Time: 1:30

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Genereously grease a 12-cup bundt pan.
Scatter 1/4 cup almonds over inside of pan. In a large bowl, beat
together butter, cream cheese, and 1 3/4 cups sugar with an electric
mixer on medium until light and fluffy, about 2 mins. Add cocoa and
beat well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

2. Sift together cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Add to chocolate mixture. Beat with mixer on low until blended.

3. In a small bowl, mix together remaining 1/4 cup almonds, remaining
1/2 cup sugar, apricots, and chocolate chips. Spoon half of cake
batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle 2/3 of apricot mixture over center
of batter (mixture will burn if it touches the sides or middle tube
of pan). Spoon on remaining batter and sprinkle remaining apricot
mixture on top.

4. Bake 50 to 55 mins, or until a cake tester inserted in center
comes out clean. Let cake cool in pan 15 to 20 mins, then invert onto
a rack to let cool completely before serving.
