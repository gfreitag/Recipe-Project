Wash the kale or collard greens under cold running water.  With a
sharp knife, trim away any bruised or blemished spots and cut the
leaves from their tough stems.  Shred the leaves into 1/4 inch
strips. In a large pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil over high
heat. Drop in the greens and cook them uncovered for 3 minutes. Then
drain them in a colander, pressing down on the greens with a spoon to
extract all their liquid. In a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet, melt the
bacon fat over moderate heat, and when it is hot, but not smoking,
add the greens. Cook, stirring frequently, for 30 minutes, or until
the greens are tender, but slightly crisp. Don't let them brown. Stir
in the salt and serve at once. If the greens must wait, cover them
with foil, and keep them warm in a preheated 250 degree (F) oven.
