THE DAY BEFORE combine all dried fruits, nuts and zest in a mixing
bowl. Add the candied ginger and the spices and toss well to mix. Add
molasses and liquids and mix well. Cover and let stand overnight at
room temperature. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 275F. Grease 4
(9-by-5-by-3-inch) loaf pans, line them with waxed paper and grease
the paper. Coat lightly with flour. Sprinkle 1 cup flour over fruit
mixture and stir it. Combine the remaining 3 cups of flour with
baking powder, baking soda and salt and sift them together on a sheet
of waxed paper. Cream the butter, add the brown sugar and beat well.
Add eggs, 2 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the
vanilla. Add all dry ingredients and beat until batter is blended and
smooth. Pour batter over fruit, mix well until everything is coated
with batter. Divide batter among loaf pans, filling to 1/2 inch below
top. Bake for 2 hours. Don't worry if they crack on top. Cakes are
done when a straw inserted in the center comes out clean.
