This Irish dish is best made with coarse skinned baking
potatoes,because they breack down easily to produce fluffier mashed
potatoes.

Peel potatoes.  Cut each into 3 chunks.  In 12 cup casserole, sprinkle
potatoes with 2 tbsp water, cover, and microwave on high for 15-18
minutes or until tender, rearranging occasionally. Mash well. Stir in
milk, onions and butter. Microwave, uncovered on high for 1 minutes
or until heated through.  Add salt and pepper, beat until smooth.
Makes 4 to 6 servings.
