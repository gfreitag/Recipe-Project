2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
12 oz (2 3/4 cups) walnut pieces
12 oz Semi-sweet chocolate*

The ultimate indulgence!

Use the middle rack of the oven. Preheat oven to 425ø. Butter bottom
and sides of two 13 x 9 x 2-inch aluminum pans, and dust lightly with
flour.

For brownies, melt chocolate, butter and coffee on top of a
double-boiler. Blend until smooth.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat eggs, salt, sugar and extracts
until light in color and creamy. Add melted chocolate to creamed
mixture, then mix in the flour and fold in walnut pieces.

Pour batter evenly into pans. Reduce oven to 375ø and bake for 30
minutes. Test for doneness with a toothpick (center will come out
clean and dry). Remove from oven and refrigerate immediately to cool.

To make icing: in the top of a double-boiler, add white chocolate,
chopped in pieces, sugar and cream. Heat until smooth; sugar should
be completely melted. Pour over cooled brownies. Sprinkle walnuts on
top. Return to refrigerator for chocolate to set.

Serve at room temperature, or freeze in trays, or serve individually
by wrapping in saran wrap and foil.
