1. Melt white chocolate in a double boiler over hot --- not boiling
~-- water or in a glass bowl in a microwave on Medium about 2 to 3
mins, stirring several times. In a medium saucepan, heat cream to
boiling; boil 30 secs. Whisk cream into white chocolate until
thoroughly blended and smooth. Refrigerate 5 to 6 hours, or
overnight, until well chilled.

2. Meanwhile, prepare bittersweet chocolate cups. Place 10 paper
muffin cups in muffin tins. In a microwave or over low heat, melt
bittersweet chocolate until smooth and shiny when stirred. Using a
table knife or pastry brush, coat inside of paper muffin cups with
melted chocolate. Be sure coating is not too thin, or cups will break
when paper is peeled away. Refrigerate until set and well chilled, 2
to 3 hours. Remove cups from muffin tin and peel off paper. Place
chocolate cups on a baking sheet. Cover loosely and return to
refrigerator.

3. Place white chocolate mousse in a large bowl. Beat with an electric
mixer on high speed, until mixture is fluffy, stiff, and holds its
shape when beaters are lifted, 4 to 6 mins. Do not overbeat.

4. Reserve some raspberries for garnish and gently fold remaing
raspberries into white chocolate mousse. Spoon into chocolate cups.
Return to refrigerator and chill at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours
before serving. Serve garnished with raspberries.

Note: White chocolate and raspberry mixture can also be served alone
(without chocolate cups) in stemmed glasses for an attractive dessert.

NOTES : The section on making chocolate cups is useful for many other
unique desserts.
