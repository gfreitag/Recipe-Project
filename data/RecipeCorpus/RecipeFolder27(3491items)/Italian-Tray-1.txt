THIS IS BASICLY AN ANTIPASTO SALAD, MORE OR LESS

Get out a beautiful glass serving tray or any other large
serving tray and arrang carefully the following:

Make carrot curls.  Use a potato peeler to give you long, thin
stirps. Roll up strips and crowd, side by side, in a deep bowl. Cover
with water and chill.

For celery branches, cut vcelery stalk in 3-inch lengths and make
small slices on each end--not quite trhough to the middle. Place in
bowl, cover with water and chill.

For radishes, make many "almost through" slices on the tip. They will
open after they've been placed in a bowl, covered with water and
chilled. (Carrots will curl, radishes will open, and celery will turn
into miniature branches if, after they are cut, they are submerged
into a bowl of cold water and refrigerated a few hours or overnight.)
