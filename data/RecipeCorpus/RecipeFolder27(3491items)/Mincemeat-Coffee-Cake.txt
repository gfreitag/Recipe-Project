1 ts Cinnamon, ground
1/8 ts Allspice, ground
1/8 ts Cloves, ground
1/8 ts Mace, ground
5 c  Flour (to 5 1/2 cups)
1 1/2 c  Mincemeat, prepared
Confectioners' sugar
2 pk Active dry yeast (1/4 oz.

In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup milk.  Add sugar, butter,
eggs, salt, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, mace, 2 1/2 cups flour and
the remaining milk.  Beat until smooth.  Stir in enough remaining
flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured board; knead until
smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl,
turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until
doubled, about one hour. Punch dough down; let rest 10 minutes.  Turn
onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 16x12 inch rectangle.
Spread mincemeat to within 1 inch of edges. Roll up from one long
side.  Pinch seams; join and seal ends to form a circle. Place in a
greased 10 inch fluted tube pan. Cover and let rise until nearly
doubled, about 30 minutes.  Bake at 375 for 40 to 45 minutes or until
golden brown.  Cool 10 minutes in pan before removing to wire rack.
Just before serving, dust with confectioners' sugar. Yield: 12 to 16
