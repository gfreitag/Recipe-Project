Title: Jim's Hot Maple BBQ Sauce
Categories: Syrup, Tomato, Salsa/sauce, Bbq/grill
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 t  Basil
1/4 t  Salt
3 c  Tomato juice
1/2 c  Maple syrup
2 md Jalapeno peppers, chopped
-(optional)
2 sm Cloves Garlic, minced
1/4 c  Onion, chopped
In a saucpan, Combine all ingredients except maple syrup. Bring to a
boil; reduce heat and simmer until reduced by half. Add maple syrup;
bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until it reaches desired
thickness. Strain and bottle. As with any tomato sauce, this will
burn on the bbq. So baste in the last 5 minutes of cooking. It's best
if injected into chicken or into a beef roast and basted in last 5
minutes as above. Yield: 6-8 ounces, depending on thickness. Note:
This gets better as it ages. Will keep in refrigerator up to a month.
This is also good on hamburgers, hot dogs, sausage and ribs. I make
this both with and without jalapeno, for our fire department chicken
bbq each year. They always run out of chicken and last year they did
1,000 chickens. SOURCE:*Jim Bodle POSTED BY: Jim Bodle 3/94, 2/95
