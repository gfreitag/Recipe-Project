In a medium saucepan, bring honey, molasses and brown sugar to a boil,
stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat; cool until slightly warm.
In a large bowl, beat together cooled honey mixture, egg, lemon peel
and orange peel.  Add flour, chopped almonds, baking soda, cinnamon,
cloves and nutmeg, beating until blended.  Stir in candied orange
peel and citron until blended.  Dough will be stiff, but sticky. Wrap
and refrigerate several hours or overnight.  To bake cookies, preheat
oven to 350F (175C). Grease baking sheets.  Divide dough into 2 equal
portions. Work with 1 portion of dough at a time.  On a floured
surface, roll dough 1/4 inch thick.  Using floured 2-1/2- inch cookie
cutters, cut into hearts or rounds. Place cookies 1 inch apart on
greased baking sheets. Bake 12 minutes or until done. Meanwhile,
prepare Sugar Glaze; keep hot. Remove cookies from baking sheets;
cool on racks. Brush hot cookies with hot Sugar Glaze. Decorate with
almond slices and candied cherries, if desired. Allow cookies to dry.
Store in an airtight container 1 to 2 weeks to age and soften. Put a
slice of apple in the container to help soften the cookies. It will
take a few days, but check daily to make sure apple doesn't mold.
Makes about 50 (3-inch) hearts or rounds.

In a medium saucepan, combine granulated sugar and water.  Bring to a
boil; reduce heat and simmer 3 minutes.  Remove from heat; stir in
