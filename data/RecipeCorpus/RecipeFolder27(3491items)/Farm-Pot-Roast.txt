AN EXCELLENT POT ROAST GREAT FOR ENTERTAINING

Dredge the meat in the 1/4 cup flour, season with salt and a
little pepper if you like.  Brown slowly on all sides in shortening
with garlic cloves in a heavy kettle. Watch that garlic--when it's
brown lift it out! Add vegetables, return garlic, season to taste.
Add 1/2 cup water. Simmer covered, until tender, about 3-1/2 hours.
Turn the pot roast occasionally, adding more water if needed.  Remove
the meat, strain vegetables, and measure broth in pot and add enough
meat stock to make 2 cups. Blend and add the 2 tablespoons of flour
and 1/4 cup cold water. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened.
