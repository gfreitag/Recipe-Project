Title: Kalamarakia Tighanita (Deep Fried Small Squid)
Categories: Middle east, Greek, Appetizer, Seafood
Yield: 8 servings
Black pepper; freshly ground
1 c  Flour
3    Lemon; cut lengthwise into
;wedges
Skordalia; (garlic & potato
;sauce), optional
Vegetable oil; or shortening
;for deep fat frying
4 lb Squid, small; cleaned and
;cut crosswise into 1/2 inch
;thick rings
Salt
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees (F) and line a baking pan with paper
towels.
In a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet, heat 1 to 2 inches of oil until
hot but not smoking, or until it reaches a temperature of 375 degrees
on a deep frying thermometer.  Wash the squid under cold running
water and pat them completely dry with paper towels.  Sprinkle the
squid liberally with salt and a generous grinding of pepper.  Pour
the flour into a shallow bowl.
A dozen or so at a time, drop the squid into the flour and toss them
about to coat them evenly.  Then shake the squid in a sieve to remove
the excess flour.  Drop the squid into the hot oil and fry them for
about 5 minutes, or until golden brown on all sides.  As they brown,
transfer them with a slotted spoon to the lined pan to drain, and
keep them warm in the oven while you flour and fry the remaining
batches.
Mound the squid on a heated platter, garnish with lemon wedges and
serve them, if you like, with a dip of skordalia.
