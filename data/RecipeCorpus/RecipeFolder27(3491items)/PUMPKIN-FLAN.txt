Title: PUMPKIN FLAN
Categories: Vegetable, Dessert, Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
-evaporated milk
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 tb Brandy (or Asbach-Uralt),
-optional
1/4 c  Brown sugar, packed
INGREDIENTS:
1 c  Pumpkin
1/4 c  Honey
3/4 ts Cinnamon
5    Eggs
1 cn (13 oz.) Carnation
(TIP:) Six individual custard cups can be used as well as the form in
the main recipe section.   Bake them at 325 degrees for 45 minutes,
and test with a knife at the edge of the custard.   The center will
continue to cook when  removed  from the oven because of the small
size. Cover and chill. For a pumpkin flan "brulee" sprinkle the brown
sugar over the BAKED custard (rather than in the bottom of the cup)
and broil 4 inches from the heat until the  sugar  bubbles, watching
every second....it burns *very* easily. When the sugar bubbles,
remove it immediately, cover and chill.

Combine  the pumpkin,  honey and cinnamon.   Beat the eggs.    Add
milk, vanilla and pumpkin mixture to the eggs.  Stir in the brandy,
mixing well.

Sprinkle  the  brown sugar over the BOTTOM of a  buttered  10-inch
baking dish.  S-l-o-w-l-y  pour in the custard mixture and place the
baking dish in a pan of hot water.   Bake (together with the pan of
hot water) at 350 degrees for one hour, or until the custard is set.
Insert a knife into the custard.  If it comes out clean, the custard
is done. Cover and chill for 2 to 4 hours before serving.
