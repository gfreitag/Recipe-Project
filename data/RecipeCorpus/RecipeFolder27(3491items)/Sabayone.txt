In the top of a double boilier, combine the egg yolks and sugar,
beating well.  Add the wine to the egg mixture.  Have the water inthe
double boilier, simmering and place the pan with the egg mixture on
top. Whisk the mixture constantly until it thickens into a fluffy
custard, about 5 minutes.  Remove the egg mixture from the heat and
beat until cool. Fold the stiffly beaten whipped cream into the
cooled egg mixture and add the liqueur.  Spoon the mixture over the
cherries and serve.
