Preparation Time: 0:25 1. Preheat oven to 350 F. In a large bowl,
beat together butter and sugars with an electric mixer on medium
speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 mins. Beat in eggs and vanilla
and continue beating 2 mins. Beat in flour, baking soda, and salt
until well blended, 1 to 2 mins. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts. 2.
Drop dough by generous tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart on foil-lined
cookie sheets ( about 12 to a pan). Flatten dough rounds slightly
with fingertips. Bake 8 to 10 mins, or until very light golden. Do
not overbake or cookies will be too hard when cool. Let cookies stand
5 mins, then remove to wire racks to let cool completely.
