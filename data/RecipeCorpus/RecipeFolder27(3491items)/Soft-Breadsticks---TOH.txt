Title: Soft Breadsticks - TOH
Categories: Bread, Diabetic
Yield: 12 servings
3 c  Flour, divided
Cornmeal
1    Egg white
1 tb Water
Coarse salt (optional)
1/4 oz Active dry yeast
1 c  Warm water (110-115 degrees)
3 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
In mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water.  Add sugar, salt and oil;
stir until dissolved.  Add two cups of flour; beat until smooth.  Add
enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured
board; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Place
in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in
a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  Punch dough down and
divide into 12 portions. Using your hands, roll each portion into a
10x1/2 inch strip. Place 1 inch apart on a greased baking sheet
sprinkled with cornmeal. Let rise, uncovered, until doubled, about 45
to 60 minutes.  Beat egg white and water; brush over breadsticks.
Sprinkle with coarse salt, if desired. Blase baking sheet on middle
rack of oven; place a large shallow pan filled with boiling water on
lowest rack.  Bake at 400 for 10 minutes. Brush again with egg white.
Bake 5 minutes more or until golden brown.
