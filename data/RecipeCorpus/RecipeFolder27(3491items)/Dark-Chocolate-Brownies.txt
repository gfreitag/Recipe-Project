Categories: Cake/cookie, Chocolate
Yield: 16 servings
3    Jumbo eggs
1 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Vanilla
1 1/2 c  Walnuts; coarsely chopped
- OR pecans
2/3 c  Unsalted butter
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate;
- cut into small pieces
2 oz Semisweet chocolate;
- cut into small pieces
1 c  Granulated sugar
3/4 c  Light brown sugar; packed
PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 375~. Melt the butter with the four squares of
chocolate in a large saucepan over low heat, stirring often. Remove
the pan from the heat and mix in the granulated and brown sugars,
eggs (one at a time), flour, salt, vanilla and nuts. Spread the
batter into a well-buttered 9x9" baking pan, pushing it well into the
corners and smoothing the top. Bake the brownies uncovered for 35-40
minutes, or until the brownies feel fairly firm and begin to pull
away from the sides of the pan. Cool the brownies in the upright pan
on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes. Cut them into large squares.
