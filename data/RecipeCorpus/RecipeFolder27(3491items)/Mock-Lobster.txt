Title: Mock Lobster
Categories: Fish
Yield: 10 servings
1/2 c  Horseradish; prepared
1/4 c  Sour cream
2 lb Haddock; fillet
Tomato juice; or V8/to cover
1/2 c  Chili sauce
Poach fish in tomato juice to cover with spices of your choice or in
V8. Simmer until fish flakes. Mix the other ingredients together and
adjust for YOUR taste. Add the sauce to the fish...making sure it is
not too thick. It should look like lobster salad and you can use
diced celery and/or onion. In the 50's whenever you went to a
luncheon at the Temple it seems that this was the dish of choice. I
guess we were trying to prove we could have 'lobster' and be kosher
too, <GRIN>!!!! Anyway it is quite good. If you have a fovorite
lobster or shrimp salad; you could just substitute the fish. Back in
those days it was cheaper...now who knows??? Recipe originally taken
from the LEVITTOWN JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER COOKBOOK; circa 1956.
