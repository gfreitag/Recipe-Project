Rinse the beans under cold running water and combine them with 5
cups of water in a heavy 5 quart casserole.  Bring to a boil, reduce
the heat to low and let the beans simmer, half covered.
In a heavy 8 to 10 inch skillet heat the oil over moderate heat.
Add the onions and garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5
minutes, or until the onions are soft and transparent but not brown.
Stir in the tomatoes, basil, oregano and a few grindings of pepper,
raise the heat and boil briskly, stirring, until the mixture becomes
a thick puree. Add the puree and the squash to the simmering beans.
Cover and cook over low heat for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  When the beans
are tender, stir in the corn, and simmer 5 minutes.  Season with
salt, and transfer the beans to a serving bowl. Serve hot in soup
plates. If you like, serve pebre sauce with the beans, topping each
portion with a spoonful of sauce.
NOTE:  If fresh cranberry beans are unavailable, substitute 1 1/2
cups of dried cranberry or navy beans.  Rinse them, bring to a boil
in 6 cups of water, and boil for 2 minutes.  Turn off the heat and
let the beans soak for an hour.  Add the puree and squash and proceed
with the recipe.
