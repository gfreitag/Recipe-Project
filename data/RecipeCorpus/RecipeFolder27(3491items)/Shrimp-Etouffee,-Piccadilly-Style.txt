1 1/2 lb Frozen shrimp
6-8 shakes tabasco

Saute onions and bell pepper in margarine or butter until tender. Add
cream of mushroom and celery (low-salt)soups, tomato sauce, and crab
boil. Simmer 15 minutes, stirring often. Rinse shrimp in very hot
water to break apart, drain and add to sauce. Simmer until shrimp are
tender, approximately 10-15 minutes. You may wish to under cook the
shrimp if you're going to chill then reheat the etouffee in the oven
(at about 325 until warmed completely through; be sure to cover pan).
Can double or triple recipe. Serve over boiled long-grain rice. The
old bay brand seasoning is very salty so that is why you use the
low-salt soups.
