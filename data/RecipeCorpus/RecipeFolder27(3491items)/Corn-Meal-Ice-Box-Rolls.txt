Prize winning recipe

Make a sponge of the yeast, 1/2 cup water, and 3 tablespoons flour.
Cover and allow to stand until light.  Sift corn-meal slowly into the
boiling water, add salt, and stir constantly until thick. Cook over
hot water 30 minutes.  Add shortening, sugar, and potato water
(prepared by boiling 1 cup diced potatoes in 2 cups water). Stir
until well blended. Cool. Add the sponge.  Add sufficient flour to
make a dough stiff enough to knead. Turn onto lightly floured board.
Knead until smooth and elastic. Cover with a damp cloth and allow
dough to double in bulk. Knead down. Cover closely and place in
refrigerator. Remove portion of dough required from refrigerator 2
hours or more before rolls are needed. Allow dough to warm to room
temperature.  Form into rolls.  Place in well-oiled pans.  Cover and
let rise until treble in bulk.  Bake in hot oven (450Ã¸ F) about 15
minutes. The unused portion of the dough should be worked down,
covered closely with waxed paper, and returned to the refrigerator
until needed. 75 rolls. Mrs. L. Carlile, Sheridan, WY.
