Title: Ham Steaks with Whiskey Sauce
Categories: Meat
Yield: 4 servings
1 oz Flour
1 oz Butter
3/4 c  Water or stock
Salt or pepper to taste
4 x  Ham steaks
2 tb Finely chopped onion
1 tb Brown sugar
1 tb Whiskey
Brush steaks with melted butter.  Snip fat to prevent curling, and
grill for 7-8 minutes each side. -- To make sauce, gently fry onions
in remainder of butter until cooked. Remove from heat and stir in
flour gradually. Add stock.  Return to heat.  Add sugar and bring to
the boil. Simmer gently for about 2 minutes to cook flour. If sauce
seems a little thick, add more water.  Add whiskey and season to
taste.  Place gammon steaks on a warmed serving platter and pour on
sauce.
-- Serve with peas and carrots, or sauteed potatoes.
