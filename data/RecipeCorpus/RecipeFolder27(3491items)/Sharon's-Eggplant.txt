Categories: Vegetable, Tomato, Side dish
Yield: 1 servings
Freshly ground pepper
2-3 cups yogurt

Slice eggplant lengthwise.  Fry in a hot skillet with a bit of olive
oil, until slightly browned.  Set aside. Using same skillet, sautee
onions, and tomatoes until glossy and starting to soften.  Add the
tomato paste and fresh pepper. Layer eggplant on bottom of casserole,
spoon tomato/onion mixture over top.  Spoon 1 to 1-1/2 cups yogurt
over onion mixture and sprinkle with parsley.  Layer remaining
eggplant, tomato/onion mixture, rest of yogurt and parsley.  Sprinkle
a bit of parmesan over top and bake in a 350 oven.  I didn't catch
the time, but I baked it for about 30-45 minutes. Origin: Adapted
