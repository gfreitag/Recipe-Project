pan with 2-inch-high sides.  Combine butter and both chocolates in
top of double boiler set over simmering water; stir until melted.
Remove from over water and cool mixture slightly.

Using electric mixer, beat eggs, sugar and vanilla in large bowl until
slightly thickened, about 1 min. Beat in chocolate mixture. Add flour,
baking powder and salt and mix until combined. Stir in 1 cup chopped
Heath bars. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining 2
tablespoons chopped candy.  For fudgy consistency, bake until tester
inserted into center comes out with moist batter still attached.
about 27 min.; for cakelike texture bake until tester inserted into
center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 35 min.
Cool. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and store at room
temperature.)

Rewarm sauce over low heat. Cut brownie into 9 pieces. Spoon warm
caramel sauce onto 8 plates. Place 1 brownie in center of each
(reserve extra brownie for another use). Surround each with 3 small
scoops of ice cream.
