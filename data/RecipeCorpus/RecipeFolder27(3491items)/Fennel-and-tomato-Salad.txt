baked, creamed, grilled or steamed, with a little butter or parmesan
and salt, it makes an excellent side dish. *Stir-fry it withother
Mediterranean vegetables. *Delicious dipped in batter and fried,
tempura-style. *Excellent in soup. *Gives a wonderful flavour to fish
and seafood dishes. Submitted By FLEURETTE DELISLE   On
