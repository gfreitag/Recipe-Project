1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. In a large bowl, beat together butter and
granulated sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until light
and fluffy, 1 to 2 mins. Beat in melted chocolate, mashed potatoes,
and coffee powder until well blended. Add eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each addition.

2. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat into chocolate
mixture alternately with Irish liqueur just until combined. Turn
batter into well-greased 12-cup bundt pan.

3. Bake 45 to 50 mins, or until a cake tester inserted in center
comes out clean. Let cake cool in pan 15 mins, then unmold onto a
wire rack and let cool completely. Sift powdered sugar over top of
cake before serving.

NOTES : Leftover mashed potatoes keep this cake moist. Use the real
thing---not instant mashed potatoes, which will alter the
taste.
The generous amount of Irish creme liqueur imparts an
intriguing
flavor to this special cake.
