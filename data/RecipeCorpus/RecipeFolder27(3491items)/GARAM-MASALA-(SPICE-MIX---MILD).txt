Title: GARAM MASALA (SPICE MIX - MILD)
Categories: Indian, Vegetarian, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 ts Mace
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1 oz Cinnamon
1 oz Black pepper
3 oz Coriander seeds
1 oz Cumin seeds
1/4 oz Fenugreek seeds
1 oz Cloves
2 oz Cardamon seeds (brown best)
Roast coriander seeds, cumin, and fenugreek seeds separately for a few
minutes until their rich aroma is given off.  Combine with all other
ingredients and grind.

Pass the mixture through a sieve and store in an airtight jar.

NOTE:  Roasting the ingredients separately is important since each
gives off its characteristic aroma at a different time.
