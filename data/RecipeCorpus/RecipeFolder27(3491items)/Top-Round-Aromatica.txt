Title: Top Round Aromatica
Categories: Beef
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Dry red wine
2 tb Cognac
1/2 c  Heavy cream (optional)
2 tb Fresh chopped parsley
ÿSalt
Parsley sprigs
2 lb Top round beef steak, cut
ÿ1 inch thick
1 1/2 tb Crushed black (Java) pepper
1 tb Butter
1/4 ts Garlic powder
1 tb Vegetable oil
This is SOOOO good. I make it without the sour cream and it is SOOOO
good without the sour cream that it is probably devine with it.
Warning: once you start cooking this, you should have your
accompaniments ready; the cooking goes pretty fast.  I heat up a
toaster oven first and when the time comes to keep the steak warm, I
turn OFF the toaster oven and pop the steak in (it JUST fits).

Combine crushed pepper, butter, and garlic into a paste. Spread
evenly on both sides of the steak.  Heat oil in heavy frying pan over
medium high heat.  When very hot, add steak and brown evenly on both
sides.  Allow 7 minutes per side for rare, 8 minutes for medium rare,
and 9 minutes for medium.  Place steak on a serving platter and keep
warm.

Deglaze the pan with the wine and cognac and cook 1 minute.  Reduce
heat, add cream and chopped parsley and continue cooking 1-2 minutes,
stirring constantly.  Season to taste with salt.

Carve steak diagonally across the grain into thin slices.  Pour the
sauce over steak and garnish with parsley.
