A typical stew which blends the Oriental and the Western cuisines. It
is said that Philippine dishes require garlic and bay leaf from
Spain, pepper from Malay, soy sauce from China, and vinegar to prove
it's a native of the Philippines. DIRECTIONS: Broil chicken and veal
on rack close to source of heat. Turn once to brown all sides.
Transfer to flameproof serving casserole with cider vinegar, soy
sauce, garlic, bay leaf and peppercorns. Let stand at least 1 hour,
turning meat pieces several times. Add water to cover meat. Cover
casserole and let simmer very slowly for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. At the end
of the cooking process there should be very little sauce left in pan.
If necessary, remove cover and let simmer until liquid reduces.
Remove bay leaf. Garnish with pimento. Serve each portion over 1/2
cup rice. *From Weight Watchers International Cookbook* Submitted By
