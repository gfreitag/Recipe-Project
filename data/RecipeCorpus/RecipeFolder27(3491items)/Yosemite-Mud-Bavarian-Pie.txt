1. To make Bavarian filling, in a glass measure, sprinkle gelatin over
coffee to soften; set aside. In a medium saucepan, whisk together
sugar, milk, and cocoa. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce to
low and cook 2 mins. Remove from heat; stir in reserved gelatin
mixture and refrigerate until mixture holds its shape.

2. Whip 1 cup cream until stiff and fold into gelatin mixture until no
streaks of white remain. Turn into chilled Chocolate Coconut Crust.
Sprinkle marshmallows and walnuts over top. Refrigerate 6 hours or
overnight.

3. Just before serving, make topping: In a small glass bowl, melt
chocolate chips and butter in microwave on High 30 to 40 seconds, or
until melted and smooth when stirred. Stir in remaining 1 Tbs cream.
Let cool for 5 mins, then drizzle over pie and serve.

NOTES : A fabulous pie with a chocolate coconut crust, a chocolate
Bavarian filling and a rocky road-style topping. This will send
any chocolate lover into waves of wild ecstasy.
