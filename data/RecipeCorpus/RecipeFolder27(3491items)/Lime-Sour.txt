Title: Lime Sour
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Condiment
Yield: 1 batch
1 1/2 ts Salt
Juice of 15-20 limes
Strain the juice and add the salt.  pour into a clean pint bottle (a
half wine bottle is fine), tie on a muslin cover and let stand at room
temperature 2 weeks to age.  Then cap the bottle or decant into
smaller bottles.  Keep in a cool place.

Save empty Worcestershire or soy sauce bottles with their plastic
shaker caps.  They are ideal for Lime Sour and Mushroom Ketchup

Note:  The authors say that this recipe originally comes from Jean
Hewitt's "New York Times Heritage Cookbook."  Ordinary limes are
acceptable to use, however the recipe is from Key West where wild Key
limes are used. This is good for soups (like carrot), casseroles,
fish, vinaigrette or mayonnaise. You can mix it with honey for a
dressing for fruit salad.
