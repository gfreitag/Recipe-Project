Recipe by: Valerie Whittle Wash beans and pick over, removing pebbles
or dirt.  Place in large pot and add cold water to cover. Soak
overnight. Drain.  Add fresh water to cover Brind to a boil; boil
about 1 1/2 hours or until bean skins begin to break but beans are
intact. To test, remove a few beans with a spoon and blow on them;
the skins should ruffle. Put beans and liquid into a large ovenproof
pot. Add salt, mustard, molasses and brown sugar.  Score the rind of
the salt pork and press into the top of the beans.  Add enough water
to cover, if necessary. Bake at 300 degrees, uncovered, until beans
begin to simmer, about 45 minutes to an hour. Cover and bake for 8
hours, adding more liqui as necessary. Do not stir. Uncover for last
30 minutes of baking.
