Brownies

Brownies have been an American favorite for close to one hundred
years. Time your brownies carefully so they do not come out too "wet"
or "dry": test for doneness several times during baking.

Your guests won't know you've used a packaged brownie mix for this
one-and don't tell them.

Prepare brownies as directed on package, stirring chocolate chips or
walnut pieces into batter before baking. Let brownies cool, cut into 1
1/2-inch squares and refrigerate for 2 hours.

To prepare icing, cream together butter, salt, peppermint extract and
confectioners sugar until smooth. Spread over brownies. Let icing set.

Spread chocolate fudge topping over the top of each frosted brownie
square. Place the brownies in the freezer for 5-10 minutes. Remove and
serve or keep in a cool spot until serving.
