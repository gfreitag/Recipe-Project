Title: CHRISTMAS PASTA SAUCE *** (PDFX51B)
Categories: Pasta, Salsa/sauce, Italian, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 c  Dry red wine
1/2 c  Tomato paste
1 c  Italian tomatoes; chopped
2 tb Parsely *
1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
Small carrot;*
Small onion;*
Small celery stk;*
Large garlic clove*
1 lb Italian sausage
1/3 lb Ground beef
6 1/2 oz Pancetta; diced
1/2,1   oz dried porcini mushrooms * Finely chopped This is the other
recipe I described.  According to the author, this ragu from Emilia
Romagna is served by many Italians with the traditional pasta course
at Christmas. It is really good.  Enjoy- 1. Soak the porcini in warm
water for at least 1/2 hour. Remove from the water, squeeze dry and
chop. 2. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan or flameproof casserole, heat
the olive oil over moderate heat. Add the carrot, onion and celery
and saute until the onion is golden, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic
and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 3.  Add the sausage, ground
beef and pancetta to the pan. Cook over moderate heat, stirring to
break up the meat, until the beef and sausage are no longer pink.
Drain off any fat. Season with the salt, pepper and nutmeg. 4. Pour
in the red wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until it evaporates,
about 5 minutes.
Add the tomato paste, tomatoes, porcini and 1/2 cup of warm water.
Simmer for 30 minutes.  If the sauce gets too thick, add a little
more water. (The recipe

can be made to this point up to 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate;
reheat before serving.)  Add the parsley just before serving. FROM:
