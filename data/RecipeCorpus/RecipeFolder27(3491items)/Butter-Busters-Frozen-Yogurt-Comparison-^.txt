Remember to multiply the calorie content by the number of ounces you
eat. For example, one large nonfat sugar free at ICIBY at 12 oz.
would be 204 calories. Even though lowfat yogurt may look like a good
choice because it is only .25 or .75 an ounce, remember, you must
multilply that time the number of ounces you are eating. If your low
fat choice contains .75 fat grams an ounce and you order a 12 ounce
cup, you would be consuming 9 fat grams!
