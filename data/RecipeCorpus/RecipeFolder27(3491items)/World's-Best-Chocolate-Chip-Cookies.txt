Title: World's Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie, Chocolate
Yield: 1 servings
3 c  Flour
3/4 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Salt
3 c  Semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 c  Chopped nuts (optional)
3/4 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Brown sugar
1 c  Butter
1 tb Vanilla
2    Eggs, slightly beaten
This recipe is said to have come from a famous cookie maker. So make,
bake, and compare to see if these cookies aren't "the real thing." One
feature that distinguishes these cookies from traditional chocolate
chip cookies is their perfect size. It comes from using a small size
ice cream scoop to drop them onto the cookie sheet.

Preheat oven to 350ø.

In a large bowl, combine sugars; add in butter and cream together
with the sugar. Add vanilla and eggs; mix together.

In a separate bowl sift the dry ingredients and add to the creamed
mixture. Mix well; the dough will be stiff. Add the chocolate chips
and nuts (if using).

Line the cookie sheets with baking parchment or wax paper. Drop
dough with a small ice cream scoop onto the sheets. Bake 10-12
minutes at 350ø. Remove from oven and cool on wire racks.

Variation: For ice cream sandwiches, turn one cookie face down,
place a scoop of ice cream on it and top with another cookie.

Yield: 2 1/2 dozen. Sally Meddock, author of Super Soups (published
