Title: Spaghetti Alla Carbonara [Charcoal-Makers Spaghetti]
Categories: Pasta, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 4 servings
3    Eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 c  White wine
1 ts Pepper
1 lb Spaghetti
1/4 lb Lean bacon [pancetta], diced
3/4 c  Grated parmesan cheese

~--- This recipe is much better with Italian-style bacon [pancetta],
which is salted and peppered but not smoked.
~---------------------------------------------------------------------
~-- Dice the pancetta into small pieces. Start a pot of water
boiling; add salt and spaghetti as in package directions. While
spaghetti is cooking, saute pancetta over low flame until crisp. Mix
cheese, eggs, and wine together in a bowl. Drain spaghetti; return it
to the warm pot (NOT over heat). Pour egg mixture over hot spaghetti
and toss. Add the pancetta and toss some more; very little fat is
produced by the pancetta but try to get some of it in the mixture.
The hot spaghetti cooks the eggs adequately. Transfer to a hot
platter; serve with additional cheese. Submitted By NICK LA ROCCA
