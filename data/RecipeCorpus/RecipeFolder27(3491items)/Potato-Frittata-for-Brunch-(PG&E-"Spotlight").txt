=========================== > Directions < ===============

Peel potatoes, slice very thinly and set aside. Slice onions very
thinly.

Heat oil in a 10 inch nonstick, oven-proof skillet. Layer potato
slices in pan and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes; lower heat if
potatoes begin to brown. Using a pancake turner, turn potato slices
over, sprinkle onions on top and cook for 5 more minutes. Repeat 2
more times, turning onion with potato, until potatoes have cooked for
20 minutes total. Onions will be translucent and potatoes will be
soft and slightly golden.

Beat eggs with a whisk in a large bowl. Add rep pepper, salt and
pepper, beat again and pour mixture into skillet. As egg begins to
cook and become firm around the edges, carefully lift edge with a
flexible spatula, allowing uncooked egg to slide under the cooked
egg. Cook for 5 minutes on top of the stove. Then sprinkle with
Parmesan cheese, place skillet in oven and bake at 350 degrees for 15
minutes, until golden.

Loosen frittata from skillet edge with spatula and slide onto a large
serving plate. Cut into wedges and serve. Frittata can be enjoyed
either warm or at room temperature.
