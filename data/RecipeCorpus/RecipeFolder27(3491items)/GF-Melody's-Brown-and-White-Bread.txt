basic, easy-to-make recipe and when others tried it, the consensus
was "Wonderful." 1. Place all ingredients, except the warm water, in
bread pan and press start. While the machine is kneading, gradually
pour in the water.  If the dough does not mix well, use a rubber
spatula to assist it occasionally. 2. After the baking cycle ends,
remove bread from pan, place on wire rack, and allow to cool 1 hour
before slicing. Crust: Medium Optional Bake Cycles: Sweet Bread,
