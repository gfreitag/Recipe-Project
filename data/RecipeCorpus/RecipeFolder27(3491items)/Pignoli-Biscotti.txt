Title: Pignoli Biscotti
Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert, Nuts/grains
Yield: 48 cookies
2 T  Lemon zest
2 c  Flour PLUS
2 T  Flour
1 1/2 c  Baking powder
1/4 t  Salt
2/3 c  Pine nuts
1/2 c  Butter
3/4 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
2 T  Lemon juice
Place nuts in pan and bake in 350'F. oven 4-5 minutes. Stir
occasionally, checking to see that nuts don't burn. Let cool.

In a bowl, beat butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in eggs, lemon
juice and zest. Batter will look curdled, but don't worry. Combine
flour, baking powder and salt and stir into creamed mixture until
blended. Mix in nuts.

Divide dough in half. On a greased and floured baking sheet, pat out
the dough into 2 logs, 1/2" high, and inch and a half wide and 14"
long. Bake in a 325'F. oven 25 minutes and let cool on rack 5 minutes.

Place on a cutting board and cut diagonally into 1/2" thick slices.
Lay slices flat on baking sheet and return to oven for 10-15 minutes
to dry slightly, turning once. Makes 3 1/2 to 4 dozen cookies.
