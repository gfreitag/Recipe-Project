Title: Cerises A L'Aigre-Doux
Categories: Appetizer, Fruit, Marinade, French
Yield: 1 batch  For each pound of morello cherries (the bright red bitter cherries
which come into season in August) use 6 oz white sugar, 12 fluid
ounces wine vinegar, and 6 whole cloves.  Leave an inch or so of
stalk on the cherries, discard any that are at all damaged or
bruised, and pack the rest into wide preserving jars, filling them
about three-quarters full.

Boil the vinegar, sugar and cloves together for 10 minutes.  Leave
until cold and then pour over the cherries.  Screw down the tops and
leave for a month before opening.

Note:  The authors say that these are served like olives and that the
recipe originally came for "French Provincial Cooking" by Elizabeth
David. They suggest using these as part of a mixed hors-d'oeuvre and
that they will keep for one year.
