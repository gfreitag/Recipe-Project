1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. In a 2-qt glass bowl, combine butter and
chocolate. Heat in a microwave on High 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 mins, until
mixture is melted and smooth when stirred. Stir in rum, coffee
powder, brown sugar, eggs, and flour; mix until smooth and well
blended. Stir in 1 cup nuts.

2. Turn into a greased 9-inch glass pie plate. Sprinkle remaining 1/2
cup nuts on top. Bake 25 to 30 mins or until puffed (pie should still
be moist inside). Do not overbake. Let pie cool to room temperature
before serving topped with whipped cream.
