Name; Oven-Braised Chicken with Kumquats

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees (F).  Pat the pieces of chicken
completely dry with paper towels, sprinkle liberally with salt, and
arrange them side by side in a baking dish large enough to hold them
in one layer. Mix the orange juice, lemon juice and honey together
and pour it over the chicken, turning the pieces about in the mixture
until they are well moistened.
Rearrange the chicken pieces skin side down in the baking dish and
scatter the chopped peppers over them.  Bake uncovered and
undisturbed in the middle of the oven for 15 minutes.  Turn the
pieces over, add the kumquats and baste thoroughly with the pan
liquid. Basting occasionally, bake the chicken 30 minutes longer, or
until the leg or thigh shows no resistance when pierced with a fork.
To serve, arrange the chicken and kumquats attractively on a heated
platter, pour the pan juices over them and garnish with lemon or
orange slices.
