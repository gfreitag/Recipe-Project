salt and pepper; process briefly to combine. Add the cottage cheese
mixture and scallions to the grated potatoes and mix well. Turn into
the prepared baking dish and sprinkle with grated Cheddar cheese and
paprika.

The recipe can be prepared in advance to this point and stored,
covered, in the refrigerator, for up to 2 days.

Bake for 30-40 minutes or until golden brown.
