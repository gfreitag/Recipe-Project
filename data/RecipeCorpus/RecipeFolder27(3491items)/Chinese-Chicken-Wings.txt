Title: Chinese Chicken Wings
Categories: Poultry, Chinese
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1 ts Sesame oil
1 tb Sesame seeds
1/4 c  Chicken broth
12    Chicken Wings, about 2 lbs
1/4 c  Soy Sauce
2 tb Dry sherry
2 tb Oil
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1 tb Grated fresh ginger
Remove wing tips and discard. Cut each wing in half at the joint.
Place in large baking pan. In bowl combine soy sauce, sherry, oil,
garlic, ginger, salt, and pepper. Whisk to combine. Pour mixture onto
chicken wings. Turn wings to coat, cover, and refrigerate for 45
minutes to 1 hour. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Remove cover from
wings, turn wings to coat once more. Place in oven and bake until
golden, 30 to 35 minutes, basting and turning every 5 to 7 minutes.
After 30 minutes, reposition oven rack to 4 inches below broiler, and
preheat broiler. Broil wings 3 to 5 minutes or until dark golden
brown. Transfer to serving plate. Place baking pan on medium to
medium high heat. Add approx 1/4 cup chicken broth or water to
"deglaze" the pan. Also add sesame oil. Reduce liquid in pan to half,
being sure to scrape bottom to remove browned bits. Pour liquid over
wings, sprinkle on sesame seeds. ***The flavor of the wings is not
"teriyaki" which to me means is a dark soy sauce based sauce that is
also sweet. As you can see from the ingredients there is absolutely
no sugar in this.

Where the sodium content using regular soy sauce is high, I tried the
recipe using "low sodium" soy sauce and it comes out fine!
