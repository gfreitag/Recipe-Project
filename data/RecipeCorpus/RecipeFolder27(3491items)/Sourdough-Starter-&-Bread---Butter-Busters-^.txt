MMMMM--------------------------STARTER-------------------------------
Place milk in a glass container and allow to stand at room
temperature for 24 hours. Stir in flour and yeast. Let stand
uncovered in a warm place 2-5 days, depending on how long it takes to
bubble and sour. If it starts to dry out, stir in enough tepid water
to bring it back to the original consistency. Once it has a good sour
aroma and is full of bubbles, it is ready to use. Try to maintain
about 1 1/2 cups of starter. Each time the starter is used, replinish
with a mixture of equal parts milk an dflour. Leave at room
temperature several hours or overnight, or until it begins to fill
with bubbles. Then cover and stir in refrigerator. Starter is best if
used at least once a week. If starter isn't used for 2 or 3 weeks,
spoon out and discard about half and replenish as described. Given
attention, a starter becomes more flavorful with age. Starter can be
frozen if it is not to be used for several weeks. This will slow down
yeast action. Starter should be left at room temperature for 24 hours
after thawing. Bread: Combine above thoroughly (using half of the
flour) and let stand uncovered to ferment overnight in a warm place.
Next morning, after the mixtuer has risen and fallen, stir down any
crust  that may have formed. Add the rest of the flour. When
thoroughly mixed, turn out onto a board that has been sprinkled with
flour to prevent sticking. Shape dough into 2 loaves, put in bread
pans, brush lightly with liquid Butter Buds and let rise, covered,
until almost doubled in size. Bake in a preheated 400F oven 45-50
minutes. Note: This recipe works GREAT in a bread machine. Simply put
all of the ingredients in the machine, adding the dry ingredients
first. Serving size, I assume, is 1 slice. Per serving: 82 cal., 0.4g
