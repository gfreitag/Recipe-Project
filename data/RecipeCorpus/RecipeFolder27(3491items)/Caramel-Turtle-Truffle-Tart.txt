Preparation Time: 1:03 1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. To make crust, in a
food processor, combine butter, sugar, and vanilla. Process 1 min.
Add flour and process to blend. With machine on, add egg through feed
tube, and process just until dough forms and leaves sides of bowl. 2.
Press dough evenly into bottom and all the way up sides of an 11-inch
fluted metal tart pan with a removable bottom. Press a sheet of foil
on top of crust and line with pie weights or dried beans. Bake 10
mins. Remove foil and weights and bake 5 to 7 mins longer, or until
golden. Let cool. 3. Meanwhile, prepare truffle mixture. In a 1-qt
glass bowl, combine chocolate chips and 1/3 cup cream. Heat in a
microwave on High 1 to 1 1/4 mins, or until chocolate is melted and
smooth when stirred. When crust is cool, spread 3/4 of truffle
mixture evenly over bottom of crust. Refrigerate 15 mins, or until
truffle mixture is set. 4. In a large skillet, combine caramels and
remaining 1/2 cup cream. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring often,
until caramels are melted and mixture is smooth, about 3 mins. Stir
in pecans. Spread evenly over chilled truffle mixture. 5. Heat
remaining chocolate truffle mixture in microwave on High 15 to 20
sec, if necessary, to melt. Drizzle with a fork over top of tart.
Refrigerate until filling is set, at least 1 hour. Before serving,
remove side of pan and, using a sharp knife, cut tart into slices.
