Yield: 12 servings
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1 pn Salt
12 oz Ghirardelli bittersweet
-chocolate
1/2 c  Butter
8    Eggs, separated
DIRECTIONS: In heavy saucepan, melt broken chocolate with butter,
stirring constantly until smooth. (Or microwave on medium for 2 1/2
to 3 minutes; stir until smooth.) Beat egg yolks a few minutes with 2
Tbsp of the sugar and vanilla. Remove melted chocolate from heat;
using wire whip, quickly stir in beaten egg yolks. Beat egg whites
with salt, gradually adding remaining sugar, beating until soft peaks
form. Place chocolate mixture into a large bowl with beaten egg
whites on top. Using wire whip carefully combine the two mixtures. Do
not overmix.

Cut parchment paper to fit bottom of a 9" spring form pan. Butter
bottom of pan and top of paper. Spread batter into prepared pan. Bake

and a toothpick comes out clean in center. Cool on wire rack. Cake
will shrink down as it cools. Remove pan and loosen cake from paper.
Top with either Dark Chocolate Glaze* or Whipped Cream Frosting with
Raspberry Sauce*. For chocolate-glazed cake, trim top straight, and
turn cake upside down on a flat cake plate. For Whipped Cream
Frosting, place cake top side up.
