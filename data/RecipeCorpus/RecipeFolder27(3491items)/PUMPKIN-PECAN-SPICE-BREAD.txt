Categories: Breadmaker, Holiday
Yield: 3 servings
1/2 c  Milk

3 c  Bread flour
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 1/2 tb Butter; room temperature
1 ts Salt
1 ts Pumpkin pie spice
1 lg Egg
Process the ingredients according to the manufacturer's instructions
for the basic bread setting. Remove the bread from the bread pan to a
rack to cool.  Wrap in aluminum foil ior a paper bag to store. This
is for a 1 1/2 pound loaf.  I have set the serving for "3" if you
make a 1 pound loaf, set the servings for "2" and let the great MM
make the conversion for you. From: Bread in Half the Time -by Linda
