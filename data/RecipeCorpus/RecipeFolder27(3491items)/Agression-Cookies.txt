Title: Agression Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 10 servings
3 c  Flour
1 tb Baking soda
2 c  Chocolate chips
3 c  Brown sugar
3 c  Margarine
6 c  Oatmeal
Put the ingredients in large bowl. Mash, squeeze, knead, etc until it
is completely blended. Form into small balls about 1 to 1 1/2 inches
in size. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Butter the bottom of a
small glass and dip into white sugar, then pound the cookies flat.
Bake at 350 degrees for about 10 to 12 minutes. This is a good recipe
to use when you need to get rid of some agressions because the dough
is too heavy for most mixers. So you have to use your hands and beat
it!! You can also use peanut butter or butterscotch chips or a
mixture of them.
