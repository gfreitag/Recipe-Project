Title: Black Bean & Root Vegetable Stew
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Soup/stew, Casserole, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Parsley
1 md Parsnip, quartered
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 c  Green peas
1/2 c  Mushrooms, halved
Salt & pepper
Water or stock to cover
1/2 c  Black beans, soaked
1/2 md Turnip, cut into rounds &
-- each round halved
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1 md Onion, sliced
2 lg Carrots, quartered
1 ts Dill weed
3 lg Potatoes, quartered
In the bottom of a large casserole dish, arrange the turnip slices &
sprinkle with the nutmeg.  Layer the rest of the vegetables in order,
sprinkling in the herbs after each layer.  Top with the soaked beans.
Pour over enough water or stock to cover & season with salt & pepper.
Cover with a good tight-fitting lid & place in an oven pre-heated to
300F. Cook for 3 hours.  If you desire, add dumplings & cook for a
further 30 minutes.

NOTE: I made this recipe to emphaise the taste of the root
vegetables. Add whatever vegetables & herbs you wish.  I used black
beans to add some protein.  If exchanging legumes, be sure to use
ones that can stand a lot of cooking, kidney beans or chick peas, for
example.
