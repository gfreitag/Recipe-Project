mixing bowl, add the other ingredients and mix well.  It should be
creamy and spreadable.  Pack into ramekins, small pots with lids, or
any other pretty receptacle that is to be part of your gift.  Seal
the tops with clarified butter or cover with plastic wrap.  Store as

Note:  The authors say that these are good at tea time with toast, for
grilled sandwiches or with crudites.  Good, strong cheese is
essential.
