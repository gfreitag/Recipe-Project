Title: 100% Whole Wheat Bread (Machine)
Categories: Bread, Breadmaker
Yield: 1 loaf
1 tb Butter/margarine
1/4 c  Honey
1 1/4 c  Warm (105ø-115ø) water
2 1/2 ts Dry yeast
3 c  Whole wheat flour
1 ts Salt
2 tb Nonfat dry milk
Add ingredients in the order listed. All ingredients must be at room
temperature, unless otherwise noted. Select whole grain and baking
control for light. Press start. Tent a piece of aluminum foil, shiny
side down, over glass dome at start of baking. Remove when cooling
begins. Bread will be ready in 4 hours and 10 minutes.

Hand made 100% whole wheat bread usually doesn't rise very much.
That's why the Bread Machine is such a great invention. Its superior
kneading action makes very elastic doughs, plus it can be programmed
for long rising periods.
