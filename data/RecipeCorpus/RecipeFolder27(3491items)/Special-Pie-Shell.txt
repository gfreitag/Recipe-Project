Title: Special Pie Shell
Categories: Pie/tart, Dessert
Yield: 1 pie shell  MERINGUE SHELL:  Adds glamour to any cream or chiffon pie filling!

Beat 2 egg whites with 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar, 1/8 teaspoon
salt, and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla until foamy; gradually beat in 1/4 cup
C and H Granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Beat until stiff
peaks form, then spread roughly in buttered 8" or 9" pie pan, piling
it higher near edge but not touching side of pan.  Bake at 275 F for
1 hour until creamy in color and firm to touch.  Cool away from draft.

CRUMB CRUST:  A crunchy, flavorful pie shell to  use with any chiffon
pie filling.

Combine 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs and 1/4 cup C and H
Granulated Sugar; add 1/3 cup melted butter or margarine and mix
well.  Press into bottom and around sides of 9" pie plate.  Bake at
375 F about 7 minutes. Cool.  C and H Golden or Dark Brown Sugar in
place of granulated sugar adds extra flavor.  Cornflake, vanilla
wafer or gingersnap crumbs may be used instead of graham cracker
crumbs.

MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS:  Melt butter in 9-inch pie pan in microwave at
full power 1 to 1-1/2 minutes.  Combine crumbs and sugar, stir into
butter until well blended.  Evenly press crumb mixture against bottom
and sides of pan. Microwave at full power 2 to 2-1/2 minutes or until
firm when touched; turn pan once.
