Title: Japanese Skewered Lamb
Categories: Low-cal/fat, Meat
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Sherry
2    Garlic cloves
1/4 ts Ground ginger
1 1/2 c  Bouillon
2 lb Lean boneless lamb
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1 tb Honey
2 tb Vinegar
Before cooking:  Cut the lamb into strips that are 1/8 inch thick,
1/2 inch wide and 3 inches long across the grain. Combine the
remaining ingredients (crushing the garlic with a garlic press), and
pour the mixture over the meat.  Turn the meat to coat it well and
let it stand uncovered for 1 hour at room temperature - or covered
overnight in the refrigerator. Turn the meat occasionally so it gets
seasoned evenly. Weave the meat onto skewers. Broil them about 4
inches from the heat source for about 2 minutes on each side. Makes 8
servings. Calories per serving: 248
