Categories: Fish

1/4 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Chopped parsley
1/4 ts White pepper
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Fresh chopped rosemary (2 t

1 c  Orange juice
1 c  White wine

REMOVE THE SKIN FROM THE FILLET, if necessary, and go over the fillet
carefully with your fingers to remove any small bones. Wash and pat
dry with paper towels. Grill the fish for 3 to 4 minutes on a side,
depending on thickness, turning gently. The fish should still be
slightly translucent in the center since it will continue to cook
after being taken off the grill. While the fish is grilling, boil
down the marinade until it is reduced by half. Spoon a few
tablespoons over each portion of fish. Serve immediately. Note: The
fish may also be served at room temperature or chilled.
