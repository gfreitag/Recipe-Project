Melt the butter in a heavy pot and add the flour.  Over a low heat
cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Slowly add the warmed stock
and when well mixed, add the celery, onions, greeen onions, bay
leaves, thyme and garlic. Let this simmer for 45 minutes. Chop the
artichoke hearts fairly fine and then add to the pot along with the
artichoke water (which is approximately 2 cups).  Cook at a low
simmer for another 30 minutes. Puree 4 cups of the soup in a blender
and add pureed mix back to pot. Repeat with 4 more cups of the soup
retrieved from pot (yeah, you'll be pureeing part of what was already
pureed; trust me, it makes for a good consistency). Add salt and
pepper to taste, the Tabasco, wine and cream and bring to a simmer.
Add bouillon cube and fines herbes. Do NOT boil. To serve, ladle soup
into warmed soup bowls, sprinkling with a bit of parsley over each
bowl.

Serves 8.

* If using salted stock, you may want to use unsalted butter and
eliminate boullion cube after a taste test to check saltiness.
