NOODLES: This is a lost art. may I add that I usually use wonton
skins and make life easy for myself; but once in awhile.... Add salt
to eggs,add eggs to flour. mix with your hands until the dough leaves
the sides of the bowl. It should be fairly stiff. Knead until dough
is smooth and elastic. Roll out on a lightly floured board (or on a
white cloth). Roll and stretch until it is paper thin...well very
thin. Cut into 3" squares. Place one T of filling in center of each
square and fold to make a triangle. Crimp edges with a fork and cook
in boiling water. If you have a pasta machine (or I sometimes use FP
go for it. Cook until they rise to the top; about 10 or 12 minutes.
DO NOT COOK IN THE SOUP. You may warm them in the soup.
FILLINGS. These days I zap all the ingredients for each type of
filling in the FP...leaving the eggs for last. For the cheese
filling, you just want to combine. I would serve all but the cheese
with Chicken Noodle soup. the Cheese Kreplach are usually served on
the side (for a dairy meal) with sour cream. Each of these recipes
makes about 30; figure at least 3 each
