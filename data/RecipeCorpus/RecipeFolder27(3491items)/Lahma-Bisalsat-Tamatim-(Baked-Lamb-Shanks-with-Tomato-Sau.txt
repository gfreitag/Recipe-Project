Title: Lahma Bisalsat Tamatim (Baked Lamb Shanks with Tomato Sau
Categories: Middle east, Meat, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 servings
Black pepper; freshly ground
1 pn Cayenne pepper
9 md Tomato; fresh, ripe, peeled,
;seeded and finely chopped,
;or 3 cups canned, drained,
;chopped tomatoes
3 c  Water
1 tb Olive oil
4    Lamb shanks, meaty; each
;about 3/4 pound
2 md Onion; cut into 1/4 inch
;slices
1 ts Allspice
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1 ts Salt
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees (F).  Using a pastry brush apply the
tablespoon of olive oil to the bottom of a baking dish large enough
to hold the lamb shanks comfortably in one layer.  Place the shanks
in the dish and bake in the middle of the oven for 30 minutes,
turning the pieces occasionally so that they color evenly on all
sides.
Remove the dish from the oven and spread the onion slices over the
lamb. Sprinkle them with the allspice, nutmeg, salt, a few grindings
of black pepper, cayenne, and spread the tomatoes on top.  Pour in
the water and bring to a boil on top of the stove.  Bake on the
lowest shelf of the oven for 1 hour, or until the lamb is tender and
shows no resistance when pierced with the point of a small, sharp
knife. Serve directly from the baking dish or arrange the shanks on a
heated platter and pour the sauce over them.
