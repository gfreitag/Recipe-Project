1    Egg, lightly beaten
1 ts Vanilla extract
6 oz Milk chocolate, cut into
1/4    " to 1/2" pieces
6 oz Bittersweet chocolate, cut
-into 1/4" to 1/2" pieces
1 c  Toasted walnuts, coarsely
-chopped (*)
8 tb (1 stick) UNSALTED butter
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Buttermilk, at room

1 c  Packed dark brown sugar
(*)  Place the walnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake
at 400 degrees for about 5 minutes, shaking the sheet a couple of
times. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly butter twelve 3-by-1 1/4
inch muffin cups.

In a medium saucepan, over low heat, melt the butter and unsweetened
chocolate.  Remove the pan from the heat and cool the mixture until
tepid. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda and
salt. In another bowl, stir together the buttermilk and brown sugar
until smooth. Then stir in the chocolate/butter mixture, egg and
vanilla until combined. Make a well in the center of the flour
mixture. Add the liquid ingredients and stir just to combine.  Stir
in the chocolates and walnuts.

Spoon the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups.  Bake 19 to 22
minutes, or until a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center
of one muffin comes out with a few crumbs remaining. Remove the
muffin tin or tins to a wire rack.  Cool the muffins in the pan(s)
for 5 minutes. Remove the muffins from the cups and finish cooling on
the rack. Serve warm or cool completely.  Store the muffins in an
airtight container at room temperature. Makes about 12 muffins. From:
