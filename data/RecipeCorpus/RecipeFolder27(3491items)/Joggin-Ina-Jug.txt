Title: Joggin Ina Jug
Categories: Beverage, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
-(some use 1 until they get
-used to the vinegar taste)
1 c  Apple juice
1 c  Grape juice
1    Or 2 Tbs apple cider vinegar
Some folks also add a cup of cranberry juice to the above. Keep
pouring the portions in a quart or gallon jug.  Seems to last forever.

The "Joggin' In a Jug" mixture has a higher vinegar taste than the
above recipe.

This is an old folk's remedy that comes out of Vermont.  A man named
Dr. Jarvis (if memory serves me correct) spread the news all over
Vermont about the benefits of taking apple cider vinegar.  The older
(and smarter) folks mix one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a
glass of room temperature water then add one tablespoon of honey to
that. The apple cider vinegar acts like a rotor rooter in your veins
and the honey gives energy. You'll notice a remarkable improvement in
your energy level after a month.
