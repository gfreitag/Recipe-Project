1/3 c  Chopped nuts
3 tb Butter or margarine,
Yield: 2 - 8 inch cakes

1.  Sprinkle yeast and 1/2 tsp of the sugar over very warm water in a
1 cup measure.  Stir to dissolve yeast. Let stand until bubbly, about
10 minutes.

2.  Combine 2 cups of the flour, salt, lemon rind and the remaining
sugar in a large bowl; make a well in the middle. Beat eggs and egg
yolks in a small bowl just to mix. Pour eggs, yeast mixture and warm
milk into well. Stir liquids into flour until smooth.  Beat well.

3.  Add softened butter gradually, beating well.  Stir in 1 more cup
of the flour.  Beat until dough leaves the side of the bowl.

4.  Knead on a lightly floured surface; until smooth and elastic,
about 8 minutes.

5.  Press dough into a buttered large bowl, turn to bring buttered
side up; cover.  Let rise in a warm place, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until
doubled in volume.

6.  While the dough is rising, make Cheese Filling: Beat cream cheese
and cottage cheese in a small bowl with an electric mixer until
smooth; beat in egg yolk and sugar. Stir in lemon rind.

7.  Make Crumb Topping: Combine nuts, flour, butter, sugar and
cinnamon in a small bowl.  Grease two 8 x 1 1/2 inch pans.

8.  When dough has doubled, punch down, knead in raisins; divide
dough into four equal parts; press two parts into the bottoms and
about 1/2 inch up the sides of the prepared pans; spread each with
about 1 cup of the cheese filling.

9.  Shape remaining dough into 2 8-inch circles; place on top of
cheese filling.  Press the handle of a spoon into dough around edges
to seal.

10. Sprinkle half the crumb topping over each.  Let rise in a warm
place until dough reaches the top of the pans, about 1 hour.

11. Bake in a preheated 350 F degree oven for 40 minutes; or until the
cakes sound hollow when tapped. Cool on a wire rack. (Place foil
loosely over the crumb topping; invert onto rack, then turn right
side up.) Let cool at least 30 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with
powdered sugar.
