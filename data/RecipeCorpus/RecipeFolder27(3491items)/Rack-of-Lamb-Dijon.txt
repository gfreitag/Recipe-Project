Title: Rack of Lamb Dijon
Categories: Meat
Yield: 2 servings
Italian bread crumbs
1    Rack of lamb; medium
Dijon mustard
Have the butcher take off the chine bone--or at the very least score
it through so that the chops can be cut. The ends of the chops should
be 'Frenched"...so you can see the bone. Put dijon all over the
lamb...coat it well.  Pat the bread cumbs on top of the mustard, so
that they adhere. particularly important on the rounded side...the
top. Place lamb in a pre-heated over...450 degrees.  Roast for about
35 minutes. This will give you a RARE lamb rack...the only way as far
as I am concerned. Rest for 10 minutes and serve. Will serve two, or
one very hungry person. Recipe was adapted from FINALLY   MICHAEL'S
(RESTAURANT) in Framingham, MA. Enjoy!!!!!
