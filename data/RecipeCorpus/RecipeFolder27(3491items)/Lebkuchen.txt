One of our all-time favorites.  This spicy, fruited cookie is best
made early to give it time to mellow.

1. Heat honey to boiling in a small saucepan; pour into a large bowl.
Cool about 30 minutes.

2. Stir brown sugar, egg, lemon rind and lemon juice into cooled
honey; blend well.

3. Sift flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, cloves and
baking soda onto wax paper.  Stir into honey mixture a third at a
time. Add citron and almonds.  Dough will be stiff but sticky.  Wrap
in foil or transparent wrap; refrigerate several hours, or until firm.

4. Roll out dough, 1/8 at a time, on a lightly floured pastry board,
to a 6x5-inch rectangle.  Cut into 8 rectangles, 2-1/2 x 1-1/2
inches. Place 1-inch apart on greased cookie sheets.

5. Bake in moderate oven (350-degrees F) 10 minutes, or until firm.
Remove to wire racks.

6. While cookies are HOT, brush with HOT sugar glaze.  When cookies
are cool, decorate with almond halves, candied cherry halves and
pieces of citron, if you wish.  Use confectioners' sugar and water
mixed to a smooth paste as "glue."  Store cookies in
wax-paper-separated layers in a tightly covered container for 2 weeks
to mellow.

Makes about 5 dozen cookies.

SUGAR GLAZE:

Combine granulated sugar and water in saucepan.  Bring to boiling;
lower heat; simmer 3 minutes.  Remove from heat; stir in
confectioners' sugar. Makes about 3/4 cup.

(ELB Note: 1/2 sugar glaze is plenty.)
