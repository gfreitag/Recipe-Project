Title: Challah with candied fruit
Categories: Bread, Jewish, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
2    Eggs, lightly beaten
2 tb Butter, melted
1    Egg yolk
Poppy seeds
1/2 c  Coarsely chopped candied
-fruit
1 tb Dry yeast
1 tb Sugar
1 1/4 c  Water
4 1/2 c  -+
1 tb All-purpose flour
2 ts Salt
Method: Combine the yeast and sugar in the mixing bowl of the
Kitchen-Aid and disolve in 1 1/4 cups of warm water.

In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour and the salt. Add
the eggs amd melted and cooled butter and 2/3 of the flour mixture to
the yeast mixture. Mix at speed 2 for 2 minutes; add the rest of the
flour (along with the chopped candied fruit) up to the point that the
dough starts to leave the sides of the bowl. Grease large bowl and
place the dough in it, turning to grease the top. Cover with a tea
towel. Let rise in a warm draftless place for approximately 1 hour.

Take 2/3 of the dough and make a braid with it about 1 foot long.
Place it on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Put kiddy corner squarely
in the middle. Take the side of your hand as if in a Karate chop and
press frimly down the length of the larger bread, spreading the dough
somewhat as you go so that the smaller braid will not slip off.
Brush the braid with the egg yolk. Take the other 1/3 of the dough
and make a smaller braid (about 10 inches) which you center carefully
on the larger braid. Brush the top braid with egg yolk. Let rise in a
warm place again for about 40 mintues, don't let it rise too much.

Bake in a pre-heated oven (375 degrees), for 40 to 45 minutes. Check
after about 25 minutes to see that it isn't getting too dark, if it
is, place a piece of foil lightly over the top. When done, cool on a
metal rack. When the loaf is only a little warm, drizzle some
powdered sugar frosting over the top.

We tried this and it is truly wonderful. It would be great for either
Chanukah, Christmas or Easter brunch.
