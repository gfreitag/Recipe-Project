Title: Cranberry Almond Relish
Categories: Condiment
Yield: 1 batch
1 ts Salt
12 oz Sugar
Juice of 1 large orange
1/2 c  Chopped, blanched almonds
12 oz Cranberries
8    Fluid ounces water
8    Fluid ounces wine vinegar
1 1/2 ts Allspice
1 1/2 ts Freshly ground nutmeg
Put the cranberries in a saucepan with the water and vinegar.  Bring
to a boil and simmer until the berries pop. Mash them on the side of
the pan with a wooden spoon.  Stir in the sugar and spices, salt and
orange juice. Boil slowly, stirring once in a while until the mixture
has thickened. It will take about 30-40 minutes.  Add the almonds
during the last few minutes of cooking and stir them in well.  Pour
into clean, warm jars and cover with plastic-lined lids.

Note:  The authors say that this is good with turkey, chicken, duck,
other game birds, and ham and can be made with fresh or frozen
cranberries.
