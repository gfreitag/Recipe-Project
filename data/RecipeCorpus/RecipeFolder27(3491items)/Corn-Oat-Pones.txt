your choice of herbs, if desired
i.e. rosemary, thyme, oregano) except for oil in medium bowl. 3.
Pour 1/2 (or less) the boiling water and oil into dry ingredients at
the same time. Add only enough water to make a very stiff semi-dry
mixture. 4. Let cool for 30 minutes then form into 3 to 3 1/2 inch
patties and
place on greased cookie sheets. 5. Place cookie sheets in a
pre-heated oven (350 to 375 degrees) for an
hour or until brown around the edges. At this point, turn off the
oven
and leave the pones inside, undisturbed, while the oven cools.
This is
to dry them further.

These Pones will keep in the freezer for months.
