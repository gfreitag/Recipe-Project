1. In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in water and oil and let stand
until it bubbles, about 10 minutes.  Slowly stir semolina, 1« cups
all- purpose flour, and salt into the yeast mixture.  Turn the dough
out onto a well-floured work surface and knead until smooth, about 15
minutes.  Dough should be moist, but not sticky.  Add flour if needed.

2. Pan spray a large bowl (I use olive oil in a spray bottle), put in
the dough and cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel.  Refrigerate
overnight, or let rise in a warm place away from drafts, until
doubled in size, about 1 hour.

3. Punch down dough and cut it in half for two medium (11-inch)
pizzas. These are a good size for individual or two-person pizzas,
and can be baked on a cookie sheet, pizza stone, or made deep-dish in
an oiled cast- iron skillet or baking dish.  Larger pizzas tend to be
doughy and take longer to bake, but a full recipe of dough will fill
a cookie sheet nicely. Cut the dough into four to eight pieces for
mini-pizzas if you need to please a bunch of kids or a group that
can't agree on toppings.

4. Rolling the dough with your palm, shape each piece of dough into a
ball. It should be smooth and not too sticky.  To save time, double
the recipe and freeze extra dough balls for later use.  Wrap them
well, and defrost a ball anytime you need one.

5. Flour the ball lightly, flatten and roll out on a floured surface
until desired size and thickness (1.8- to 1/4-inch thick is usual),
or hand stretch and lay it on a floured pizza peel or back-side of a
cookie sheet. Spinning your dough in the air will dazzle your guests
~- practice can make this a handy skill -- and it makes the best
crust.  If you are using a pizza peel or cookie sheet to transfer the
pie to a hot cooking surface, be sure to dust the peel with cornmeal
or flour to help it slide.

6. Combine flavors and textures like squash, roasted onions, nuts, and
mushrooms, or contrast tangy with sweet, crunchy with smooth,
traditional with exotic.  Spoon on your sauce first, 1/4 to 3/4 cup
per medium pizza, leave «-inch uncovered around the edge.  Be careful
not to sauce the center too heavily or your slices will be limp.

7. Sprinkle the pizza with carmelized onions, sauted peppers or
mushrooms, steamed greens, roasted squash and eggplant, fresh
tomatoes, or whatever appeals to you.  Add little chunks of seasoned
tofu, tempeh, seitan, or the Pizza "Sausage" (recipe separately).
Olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and capers all give pizza a nice tang.
Good cheese tastes great, but it's easy to overload on the fat.  Try
using less of a very good cheese, or one of the low-fat or nonfat
cheeses.  If you are a vegan, you can use one of the tofu-based
cheese substitutes.  Cover the pizza evenly, but vary the toppings so
that each bite has a new surprise.  Fresh garlic and onion should go
on top so that they can brown.  Add fresh herbs and Parmesan just
after you take the pizza out of the oven.

8. Preheat the oven (and cooking stone if using) at least 20 minutes
at 450ø.  Bake mini-pizzas 10-15 minutes and larger pizzas for 15-20
minutes, or until the bottom is crisp and browned (less with a
cooking stone).
