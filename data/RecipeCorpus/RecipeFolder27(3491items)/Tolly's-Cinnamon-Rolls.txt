remaining flour to form workable dough.  Turn dough out onto lightly
floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
Transfer dough to oiled bowl, turning to coat all surfaces. cover
with damp towel and let stand in warm draft-free area until doubled,
about 1 hour.

Grease 2 large baking sheets.  Punch dough down.  Turn out onto
lightly floured surface and roll out into 12x18-inch rectangle.
Spread with butter. Sprinkle evenly with brown sugar, nuts, raisins
and cinnamon. Starting from 1 long edge, roll dough up as for jelly
roll. Cut into slices slightly over 1 inch thick. Arrange on prepared
baking sheets, tucking ends of dough under. Let stand in warm
draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Bake rolls until golden, about 25 to 30
minutes.

Manwhile, prepare icing:  Combine all ingredients in small bowl of
electric mixer and beat at high speed until smooth using only enough
orange juice to form spreadable icing.  Frost rolls while still hot.
