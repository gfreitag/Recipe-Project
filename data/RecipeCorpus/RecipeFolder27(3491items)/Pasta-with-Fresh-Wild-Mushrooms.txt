Categories: Pasta, Vegetarian, Italian, Mushroom
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/2 lb Papperdelle or other wide
- type of pasta
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
2 tb Olive Oil
1 cn 15 oz diced Italian Tomatoes

A combination of fresh mushrooms including portobello, shiitake and
crimini works best.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Heat oil in a
skillet over medium-high heat.  Add garlic and cook for a few
seconds.  Add tomatoes with their juice and cook for about a minute.
Add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper.  Continue cooking and
stir occasionally until the mushrooms have given up most of their
liquid.  Add the wine and cook for another minute or two until most
of the wine has evaporated.

Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until tender but firm - al
dente.  Drain and transfer to a serving dish.  Pour mushroom sauce
over pasta and combine.  Top with minced parsley.  Serve immediately.
