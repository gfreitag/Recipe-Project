HOW TO PLAN A BALANCED DIET
Yield: 1 servings

One of the easiest ways to make sure that your toddler or preschooler
is getting the right amount of vitamins and minerals is to use the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's new food guide triangle, a graphic
illustration of a balanced diet.

Food groups are placed on the triangle in order of their prominence
in the diet, from the base up. At the base are breads, grains and
cereals. Most chilren can eat the recommended six servings per day
from this group. On the next level are fruits and vegetables. Offer
five servings of fruits and vegetables daily. Make sure that at least
one serving is high in vitamin C. Fortified juice, citrus fruits,
melon, mango, potatoes, ad broccoli are good sources. And at least
one serving should supply vitamin A, some sources of which are dark
green and orange vegetables.

The dairy and meat groups are on the next level. Serve foods from the
dairy group three times a day and foods from the meat group two to
three times a day.

Just how big should these servings be? As a rule of thumb, serve your
child one tablespoon per year of age from each food group. If your
child is three, for example, serve her three tablespoons each of rice
(bread group), carrots (vegetable group), applesauce (fruit group),
and chicken (meat group). A serving from the dairy group is one-half
cup of milk or one-half ounce of cheese.

If your child won't eat the whole serving, don't worry. Chances are
he'l make up for it the next day. Unless your child's diet stays
off-balance for a long time, he'll get all the nutrients he needs.
