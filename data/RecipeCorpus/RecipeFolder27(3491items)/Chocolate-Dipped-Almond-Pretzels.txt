Preparation Time: 0:35 1. In a medium bowl, beat together butter,
sugar, almond paste, and egg with an electric mixer on medium, until
well blended, about 2 mins. Add flour and beat until a dough forms.
If dough is too soft to roll, cover and refrigerate 1/2 hour. 2.
Preheat oven to 325 F. Divide dough into 2 equal portions. Pat each
portion into a 4 x 5-inch rectangle.. Cut each portion into 20
(1-inch) squares. On a sheet of wax paper, roll each square of dough
with fingertips into a 6 1/2- or 7-inch-long rope. Twist into pretzel
shape and place 1 1/2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. 3.
Bake 10 to 12 mins, or until edges are just golden. Pretzels will be
pale. Let stand on pans 5 mins, then remove to racks to cool
completely. 4. Dip top sides of cooled pretzels in melted chocolate.
Let dry on racks.
