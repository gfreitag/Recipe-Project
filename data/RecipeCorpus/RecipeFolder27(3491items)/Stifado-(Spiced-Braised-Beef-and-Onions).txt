Title: Stifado (Spiced Braised Beef and Onions)
Categories: Middle east, Greek, Beef, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1    Cinnamon stick, 4 inch
2 ts Salt
Black pepper; freshly ground
2 lb Onions, small white; each
;about 1 inch in diameter
1/4 lb Feta cheese; cut into 1/2
;inch cubes
6 tb Olive oil
3 lb Beef, lean boneless; cut
;into 2 inch cubes, prefer
;round or chuck
1 qt Water
6 oz Tomato paste; can
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
1/2 ts Cumin seeds
In a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet, heat the olive oil over moderate
heat until a light haze forms above it.  Pat the cubes of beef
completely dry with paper towels and brown them in the hot oil in 3
or 4 batches, turning them frequently with a slotted spoon and
regulating the heat so the beef colors deeply and evenly without
burning. As they brown, transfer the cubes to heavy 6 to 8 quart
casserole.
To the fat remaining in the skillet, add the water, tomato paste,
vinegar, cumin, cinnamon, salt and a few grindings of pepper.  Bring
to a boil over high heat, meanwhile scraping in any brown particles
clinging to the bottom and sides of pan.  Then pour it over the meat
in the casserole. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the
casserole tightly and simmer for 1 hour and 15 minutes before adding
the onions.
To peel the onions easily, drop them into a large pot of rapidly
boiling water and cook briskly for 1 minute.  Immediately drain them
in a sieve or colander and run cold water over them.  Then trim the
ends with a small, sharp knife and slip off the peel.
Stir the onions into the casserole, re-cover and cook for 30 minutes
longer, or until the beef and onions are tender.  Stir in the cheese
and simmer uncovered for 2 or 3 minutes until the cheese softens
somewhat and is heated through. Taste for seasoning and serve
directly from the casserole.
