Categories: Chicken, Soup/stew, Low-cal/fat, Vegetable, Mushroom
Yield: 6 servings
Salt and Pepper
1/2 lb Baby Onions, peeled
1/2 c  Evaporated Skim Milk
1 tb Cornstarch
Lemon Juice
1/2 ts Lemon Rind, finely grated
Parsley, chopped
12    Chicken Thighs
1 lg Onion
3    Cloves
1 lg Carrot, cubed
1    Bouquet Garni
4 c  Fat-Free Chicken Broth
1/2 lb Mushrooms
1 tb Oil
Remove and discard skin and fat from the chicken thighs; place in a
frying pan. Add onion stuck with cloves, carrot and bouquet garni.
Cover with chicken broth, season and slowly bring to a boil. Turn
down to a simmer and cook until tender, lid askew, for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, saute the mushrooms in the oil, season with salt and
pepper, cover and cook gently until mushrooms give up all their
juices. Remove the mushrooms to a plate leaving the juices in the
skillet. Add the baby onions to the skillet and cook, covered, until
tender. If needed, add 1 or 2 tb of water or broth while cooking. Mix
together onions and mushrooms, set aside.

Remove the cooked chicken thighs to a plate, strain the cooking broth
into a bowl. Return the chicken thighs to the pan and spread the
onions and mushrooms over them.

Bring broth to a simmer in a saucepan. Mix the evaporated milk with
the cornstarch and slowly pour, stirring, into the chicken broth.
Stir until thickened, add the lemon juice and rind, correct the
seasoning and pour over the stew. Heat well and serve sprinkled with
parsley.
