I too like Mustard Sauce, and have enjoyed making it for many years.
Recently, I came upon this recipe in the Pillsbury Spring Celebrations
classics 27, 1983. It's great with won tons, and on sandwiches. In
small saucepan, combine dry mustard, sugar, salt, vinegar and egg.
Cook over low heat 2 to 3 minutes until thickened, stirring
constantly. Chill 10 to 15 minutes; stir in mayonnaise.
Refrigerate leftovers 3/4 cup. This recipe has more flavor than the
others. If you use any recipes that taste bland, including restaurant
offerings, I usually touch them up with a slight amount of sugar and
salt. Dry Mustard, which I purchase by the pound, vinegar and water
has very little flavor. Hope this helps. Merry Christmas and May God
Bless You. Karin in San Jose FROM: KARIN DAWSON (KXVR83A)
