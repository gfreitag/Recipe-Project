1/2 t  Lemon juice
4    Center-cut pork chops,
(about 3/4" thick)
1 T  Olive oil
MMMMM--------------------HOT PINEAPPLE SALSA-------------------------
1/2 c  Red onion, finely chopped
1/4 c  Jalapeno peppers, seeded,
& finely chopped
1/2 t  Salt

Chopped fresh parsley
1 cn Crushed pineapple (20 oz),

Preheat the oven to Broil.

Combine the oil, pepper, thyme and lemon juice in a small bowl. Brush
the mixture evenly on both sides of the pork chops.

Prepare the Hot Pineapple Salsa.  Combine all of the ingredients in a
medium saucepan over medium heat.  Heat, stirring occasionally, until
heated through, about 5 minutes.

Broil the pork chops 6 inches from the heat source for 14 to 16
minutes, turning once, until the meat is cooked through and no longer
pink in the center.

Serve the broiled pork chops with the warm pineapple salsa and steamed
carrots on the side, if you wish.

NOTE:  "The salsa is heated through to bring out the flavors.  It is
also excellent served with grilled or broiled chicken and strongly
fish such as tuna, swordfish or sea bass."
