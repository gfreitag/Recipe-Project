Drain Oysters, reserve liquid.  Beat egg and add to reserved liquid,

drinking glass, do not crush very fine, dip Oysters in liquid and
then in the Crackers, place on a plate, cover, refrigerate for 1
hour. Crush more crackers because the old ones are wet.  dip the
oysters again in liquid and Crackers, refrigerate again for 30
minutes or so. Deep fry until golden, drain and serve warm.  Add
seasonings to suit your self, probably does not need salt, I do not
use Hot Sauce unless a friend I know asks for it.
