Title: Lemon-Rosemary Tofu
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
16 oz Extra-firm tofu, pressed
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
2 tb Fresh rosemary, chopped fine
1/2 ts Kosher salt
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
3/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
3 tb Balsamic vinegar
1/3 c  Tamari
1/4 c  Canola oil
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

2. For the marinade, in nonreactive bowl, whisk together all marinade
ingredients.

3. For the tofu, place tofu in nonreactive ovenproof dish just large
enough to hold it in one layer.  Barely cover with marinade.  Bake
until tofu has absorbed most of marinade, 50 to 60 minutes.  Cool
tofu in marinade.

4. Refrigerate remaining marinade for another use, such as Wild Rice
and Corn Salad with Lemon-Rosemary Tofu or Lemon-Rosemary
Tofu-Roasted Pepper and Pesto Sandwiches (see recipes, separately).
When tofu is cool, cut each piece in half crosswise for sandwiches,
or cut into 3/8-inch cubes for salad.  Marinated tofu will keep 2 to
3 days in tightly covered container in refrigerator.
