3 c  Heavy cream
WHITE CHOCOLATE "ICE CREAM"
2 pt Strawberries; stem/quarter
1 pt Blueberries; stem/washed
1/2 pt Blackberries
12 T  Unsalted butter
2 c  Granulated sugar
6    Egg whites
1/4 t  Pure vanilla extract
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/2 pt Red raspberries
EQUIPMENT: Measuring cup, measuring spoons, paring knife, 9-inch cake
circle, parchment paper, electric mixer w/ paddle and balloon whip,
rubber spatula, double boiler, whisk, 2 baking sheets, cake spatula,
46-oz juice can, 100%-cottong kitchen towel, food processor with
metal blade, ice cream scoop

With a pencil, trace a 9-inch circle on each of 8 sheets of parchment
paper (each one cut to fit a baking sheet). Preheat oven to 350
degrees.

Combine butter and 1 1/2 cups of sugar in the bowl of an electric
mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat the butter on low for 1 minute, on
medium for 1 minute, and on high for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides
of the bowl and beat on high for 1 additional minute. Once again,
scrape down the bowl.

Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over high
heat. Place the egg whites in the top half of the double boiler and
continuously whisk the whites while heating to a temperature of 110
degrees, about 1 minute. Slowly pour 1/2 of the beaten whites into
the butter mixture while mixing on high, about 1 minute. Scrape down
the bowl. Slowly add the remaining whites while mixing on high.
Scrape down the bowl. Mix on high for 15 more seconds. Add the
vanilla extract and beat on high for 5 seconds. Add the flour, mixing
on low for 10 to 15 seconds, until the batter pulls away from the
sides of the bowl. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Use a rubber
spatula to finish mixing the batter, until it is smooth and
thoroughly combined.
