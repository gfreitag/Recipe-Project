Preparation Time: 0:30 1. Preheat oven to 300 F. In a 2-qt saucepan,
bring corn syrup to a boil over medium heat. Add peanut butter and
butter, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring constantly, until
butter is melted and mixture is well blended. Remove from heat. Stir
in oats, brown sugar, flour, and baking powder. 2. Drop by level
teaspoonfuls about 3 inches apart onto foil-lined cookie sheets. Bake
10 to 12 mins, or until golden. Let cookies cool at least 2 mins on
pans before removing with a wide spatula to wire racks to let cool
completely. 3. When cool, sandwich 2 cookies together with a little
melted chocolate in between. Let stand at room temperature or
refrigerate until chocolate is set.
