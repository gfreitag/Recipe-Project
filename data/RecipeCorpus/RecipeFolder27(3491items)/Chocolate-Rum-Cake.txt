Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 12 servings
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Milk
Non stick cooking spray
Chocolate rum frosting
1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
1/2 c  Walnut halves
About 20 candied cherries
3/4 c  Butter-flavored shortening
2 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
4    Eggs or 1 cup egg substitute
2 oz Melted unsweetened chocolate
1/3 c  Rum
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
With electric mixer at medium speed, beat shortening and sugar until
creamy.  Add egg, melted chocolate and rum; beat 1 minute.  In
separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt;
stir well to combine.  Add small amounts of flour and small amounts
of milk alternately to creamed mixture, beating well after each
addition. Continue to beat until well blended.  Pour batter into 3 (9
inch) cake pans that have been coated with non stick spray.  Bake in
a preheated 350 degree oven 22 minutes, or until wooden pick inserted
into center comes out clean. Let cool 10 minutes in pans; transfer to
wire racks to cool completely before frosting.  Use about 1 cup of
frosting between layers of cake. Sprinkle chopped walnuts between
each layer. Spread remaining frosting on top and sides of cake.
Decorate top with walnut halves and candied cherries. May substitute
coffee for the rum.  You can also substitute 3 tablespoons
unsweetened cocoa powder and 1 tablespoon butter for each ounce of
unsweetened chocolate.   Recipe by Pauline Heideman in St.Louis
