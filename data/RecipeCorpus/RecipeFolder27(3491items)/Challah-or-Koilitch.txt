Title: Challah or Koilitch
Categories: Bread, Jewish
Yield: 10 servings
2 ts Salt
2    Eggs, lightly beaten
2 tb Butter, melted
1    Egg yolk
Poppy seeds
1 pk Yeast
1 tb Sugar
1 1/4 c  Tepid water
4 1/2 c  --+
1 tb All purpose flour
Method: Combine the yeast and sugar in the mixing bowl of a table top
mixer and disolve in 1 1/4 cup tepid water.

In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour and the salt. Add the
eggs and melted and cooled butter and 2/3 of the flour mixture to the
yeast mixture. Mix at speed 2 for 2 minutes,then add the flour up to
the point that the dough leaves the sides of the bowl. Grease large
bowl and place the dough in it turning to grease the top. Cover with
a kitchen towel. Let rise in a draftless warm place for aproximately
1 hour. Take 2/3 of the dough and make a braid with it about 1 foot
long. Place it on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Put kiddy-corner,
squarely in the middle. Brush braid with the egg yolk. Take the rest
of the dough and make a smaller braid only 10 inches long. Take the
side of your hand and press firmly along the top of the larger braid
(to keep smaller braid in place as it is baking). Place smaller braid
on top. Brush the top braid with egg yolk and sprinkle liberally with
poppy seeds. Let rise in a warm place again, about 40 minutes, don't
let it rise too much. Bake in preheated oven at 375 degrees for 40 to
45 minutes. Check after about 25 minutes to see that it isn't getting
too dark. If it is, place a piece of foil over it for the balance of
the baking time. Wrap leftovers, if any, in wax paper.
