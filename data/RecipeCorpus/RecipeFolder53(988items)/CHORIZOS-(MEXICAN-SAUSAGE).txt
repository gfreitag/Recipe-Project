Title: CHORIZOS (MEXICAN SAUSAGE)
Categories: Pork, Mexican, Meats
Yield: 10 Servings
2 lb Pork tenderloin (ground ok)
5    Chiles anchos
1/2 ts Coriander seeds (toasted)
1/2 ts Peppercorns
1/8 ts Cumin seeds
2 tb Sweet paprika
2/3 c  Mild white vinegar
1/2 lb Pork fat
2    Chilies pasilla
3    Cloves
1/2 ts Oregano (Mexican Blended)
4    Garlic cloves (peel/crush)
2 1/2 ts Salt
2 fl Vodka (if wanted)
Chop the meat roughly, (or purchase ground pork), together with the
fat.

Toast the chilies well, turning them from time to time so they do not
burn. While they are still warm and flexible, slit them open and
remove the seeds and veins. As they cool off they will become crisp.

Grind the spices together withe the chilies.

Mix the ground spices and chilies with the rest of the ingredients
and rub them well into the meat with your hands.

Cover the mixture and set it aside in the refrigerator to season for 3
days, stirring it well each day. (Before using, fry a little of the
meat and taste to see if it has enough salt and seasoning.)

Normally the meat would be put into sausage casings, however, I just
use it straight from the bowl.  If you don't want to stuff the meat
into casings at all, leave it to mature for about a week. Store it in
containers in the freezer compartment of the refrigerator.
