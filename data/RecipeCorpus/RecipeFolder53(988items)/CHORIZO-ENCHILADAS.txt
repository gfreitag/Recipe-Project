Title: CHORIZO ENCHILADAS
Categories: Texmex, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Chorizo, link or bulk
4 c  Red chile sauce
12    Corn tortillas (1 pkg.)
Cooking oil
3 c  Longhorn cheese, grated
1 pt Sour cream
2 c  Shredded lettuce
1    Recipe guacamole, OR
2 c  Prepared guacamole
Ripe olives
Remove sausage from casings if using links, and crumble. Place in a
heavy frying pan and cook, stirring often to keep the sausage
crumbly. Drain well.  It's really greasy. Add red chile sauce (you
may used ready prepared sauce also--or substitute chunky style
picante sauce) to drained meat in frying pan and cook and stir to
blend flavors, abt. 15 min. Place 6 earthenware plates in an oven set
at 350 F. to warm. Lightly fry the tortillas and drain between layers
of paper towel. Assemble individual servings like lasagna, starting
with spoonful of sauce on plate and ending with sauce sprinkled with
cheese.

Heat in the oven to melt the cheese, for 3 to 5 min. To serve, top
with sour cream and garnish with lettuce, guacamole and ripe olives.
