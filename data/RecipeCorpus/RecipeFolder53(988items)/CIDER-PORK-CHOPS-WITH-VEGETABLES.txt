2 tb Olive oil
2 c  Apple cider or juice

In a small bowl combine salt, thyme and pepper. Rub thyme mixture
onto both sides of chops. In a 12-inch skillet brown chops in hot oil
over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Remove chops from
skillet.

Add cider and sherry to skillet, scraping up any browned bits. Return
chops to skillet; add onions, potatoes, carrots and turnip. Bring to
boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer about 45 minutes or until
tender, stirring occasionally. With a slotted spoon, transfer chops
and vegetables to a serving platter, reserving the liquid in the
skillet. Cover platter and keep warm.

For gravy, boil remaining liquid, uncovered, over medium-high heat
until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 8 minutes. In a small bowl slowly stir
half-and-half into flour and nutmeg; add to reduced liquid, stirring
constantly. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir
for 1 minute more. Pass gravy with chops and vegetables.
