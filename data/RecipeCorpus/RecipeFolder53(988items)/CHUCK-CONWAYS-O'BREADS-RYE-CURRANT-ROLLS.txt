Title: CHUCK CONWAYS O'BREADS RYE CURRANT ROLLS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Dozen
1 c  Emeril's sourdough starter
3 c  Bottled water
4 1/2 c  Flour
2 1/2 c  Stone ground rye flour
2 tb Coarse salt
2 c  Dried currants
Corn meal
In a large mixing bowl stir together starter and water. Mix in half
of the white flour and half of the rye, one cup at a time, and salt.
Stir in currants, remaining rye flour and enough of the white flour
to make a stiff dough. When dough is too stiff to stir, turn out on
to work surface. Knead until it comes together in a mass, about 8
mins; dough will still be slightly sticky. Transfer to a clean mixing
bowl, cover and set aside until double in size. Turn out dough on
lightly-floured surface and punch down with floured hands. Knead
briefly and divide in two. Roll each half into a log about 3 inches
in diameter; cut each into 12 rolls. Using palm of hand roll each
piece of dough into a small, tight round roll. Place rolls, about 2
inches apart, on a cornmeal dusted baking sheet. Cover and set aside
to rise, until barely doubled. Preheat oven to 450~. Bake for 30
mins. For crusty rolls, spray walls of oven with water with a plant
mister. Formatted by jayne@idt.net
