Title: CHRISTMAS FRUIT CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Low-cal
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  Wholewheat flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1/3 c  Low-fat margarine
1 c  Mixed dark and light raisins
1/2 c  Almonds, chopped
1/2 c  Hazelnuts, chopped
Rind of 1 orange fine grated
1 3/4 c  Grated carrots
1/2 ts Mixed baking spices (allsp?)
1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 c  Granulated sweetener
2    Eggs, beaten
3 tb Orange juice
2 tb Brandy or rum (optional)
Heat oven to 350F.  Mix flour, baking powder and salt together and
rub in the margarine until mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.

Add fruit, nuts, orange rind, carrots and spices and mix well.

Mix the sweetener into the eggs and beat into the dry ingredients. Add
enough orange juice to make a soft dough.

Put the mixture into 8" round or 7x7" nonstick cakepan and bake for
45-60 min.  (or use larger pan and reduce cooking time) When ready,
the cake should be firm to the touch and a toothpick should come out
clean. Cool in the cake pan.

Turn out upside down, make a few toothpick holes in the bottom and
spoon in any leftover orange juice and alcohol if using. Store in an
airtight container.

Suggested icing is made with apples and cottage cheese.
