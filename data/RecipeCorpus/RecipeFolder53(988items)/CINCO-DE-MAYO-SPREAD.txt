Title: CINCO DE MAYO SPREAD
Categories: New, Text, Import
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Cream cheese
2 tb Milk
1 c  Tomato Salsa Cruda
1 c  Cilantro Pesto
1 c  Avocado Salsa
To prepare the Cinco de Mayo Spread, select a springform pan or
straightsided dish that is 5 to 6 inches in diameter and 2 inches
deep. Line the bottom and sides with plastic wrap, smoothing out the
plastic as much as possible.

Beat half the cream cheese with the milk, so it is easily spreadable.
Spread this mixture evenly over the bottom of the pan. Chill for 30
minutes. Spread the Cilantro Pesto evenly over the cream cheese and
chill. Beat the remaining cream cheese with the Tomato Salsa Cruda
and carefully spread it over the Cilantro Pesto. Chill for at least 4
hours. Place a serving platter on top of the springform pan and,
holding the dishes with both hands, flip them over. Remove the
springform ring and bottom. Gently pull the plastic wrap off. Just
before serving, spoon the Avocado Salsa over the top of the spread.
Serve immediately.
