Title: CHRISTMAS CAPPUCCINO
Categories: Beverages, Christmas
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 c  Espresso beans
3 c  Boiling water
2 tb Sugar
1    Vanilla bean, split
4 c  Milk
4 oz. bittersweet chocolate,
-chopped
Whipped cream - optional
in a coffee mill, finely grind the beans.  In a coffee maker, brew the
espresso with the boiling water.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon and set
aside. Using a small knife, scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean
into a medium saucepan.  Pour in the milk and scald over moderate
heat, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add chocolate and stir until
melted. Cover and keep warm over very low heat.

Divide the hot espresso into 4 cups.  In a blender, begin whipping
half of the warm chocolate milk at low speed. Gradually increase the
speed to high and blend until frothy, about 1 minute. Pour the
chocolate milk into the cups of coffee, stir briefly and top each
serving with some of the milk froth.  Sprinkle the reserved cinnamon
sugar on top. Serve immediately with a dollop of whipped cream, if
desired.  Recipe by Yvonne Womack(Quick & Easy Cooking ch)  Serves 4
