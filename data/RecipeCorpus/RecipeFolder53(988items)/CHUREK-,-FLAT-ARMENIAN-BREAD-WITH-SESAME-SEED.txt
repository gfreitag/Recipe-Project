Title: CHUREK / FLAT ARMENIAN BREAD WITH SESAME SEED
Categories: Breads, Dumplings
Yield: 10 Servings
1 pk Dry yeast
1 tb Sugar
2 1/4 c  Water -- lukewarm
6 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 lb Unsalted butter -- melted
1 tb Salt
2 tb White sesame seeds
Sprinkle the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the sugar into 1/2 cup of
lukewarm (110-115F) water in a small, shallow bowl. Let stand for 2
or 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve the yeast completely. Set the
bowl aside in a warm, draft-free spot (such as an unlighted oven) for
about 5 to 10 minutes, or until the mixture almost doubles in volume.

Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the
center. Pour in the yeast mixture, remaining water, remaining sugar
and salt. With a large spoon beat the flour into the liquid
ingredients, continuing to beat for as long as 10 minutes, or until a
soft, spongy dough is formed. Cover loosely with a kitchen towel and
set aside in the warm, draft-free spot until the mixture doubles in
volume.

Preheat the oven to 350F.  Place the dough on a lightly floured
surface and divide it into 10 equal parts. Roll each part out as
thinly as possible into circles, then place 2 or 3 circles on a
cookie sheet. Sprinkle lightly with cold water and a few sesame seeds
and set the cookie sheet on the floor of the oven. Bake for 20
minutes, or until the bread is a pale golden brown.  Transfer the
breads with a wide spatula to a wire cake rack and bake the remaining
rounds similarly. The bread will keep several days at room
temperature if wrapped securely in foil.
