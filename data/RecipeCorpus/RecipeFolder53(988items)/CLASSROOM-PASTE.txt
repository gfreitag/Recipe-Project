How to Use It:  Classroom paste is a good all-purpose paste,
especially appropriate for work with children. It is also excellent
for papier-mache projects. Stored in a closely capped jar, this paste
will keep for several weeks.  It keeps longer than Paper Paste and is
a little softer. If it gets too thick it can be thinned with hot
water for easy spreading.
