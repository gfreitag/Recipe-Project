Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
8 oz Butter, room temperature
8 oz Soft dark brown sugar
10 oz Self-raising flour
1 ts Baking powder
1 pn Salt
2 tb Cocoa (rounded T's)
Grated rind of 1 orange
4    Eggs
1/2 c  Guinness
MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
4 oz Butter
8 oz Confectioners' sugar
Orange(juice, grated rind)
Preheat oven to 375F.  Grease 2 8-9-inch cake pans. Cream the butter
and sugar until light and fluffy. Sift the flour, baking powder, salt
and cocoa into a bowl. Add the orange rind to the creamed butter and
beat in the eggs, one at a time, including a spoonful of the measured
flour mixture with each one, and beating well between additions.
Gently mix in the Guinness, a tablespoonful at a time, including
another spoonful of flour with each addition.  If there's any flour
left over, fold it in gently to mix;  blend thoroughly without
over-beating. Divide the mixture between the tins, smooth down, and
put the cakes into the center of the preheated oven. Reduce the heat
to moderate (350F) and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the cakes are
springy to the touch and shrinking slightly in the pans. Turn out and
cool on a wire rack. . Meanwhile, make the icing. Cream the softened
butter and icing sugar together thoroughly, then blend in the grated
orange rind and enough juice to make an icing that is soft enough to
spread. When the cakes are cold, use half the icing to sandwich them
together, and spread the rest on top.
