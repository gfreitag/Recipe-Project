1 ts Minced garlic
3 c  Small broccoli florets
1    To 2 T water
18 oz Soft silken tofu
1 tb Prepared mustard

1    To 2 T. nutritional yeast

Crust:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Grind oats to a coarse flour n a
blender or food processor. Place ground oats in a large bowl. Stir in
whole wheat flour, white flour, salt and baking powder. Drizzle 1/4
cup canola oil over flour mixture and mix lightly; add more oil of
necessary, until mixture looks like wet sand. Drizzle lemon juice,
honey or maple syrup and 2 T water over dough.  Mix lightly with a
fork until dough forms a ball, adding more water if necessary. Roll
out dough between sheets of waxed paper. Sprinkle sesame seeds evenly
over bottom of a quiche or pie pan, then place dough in pan. (If
using a pie pan, fold excess dough over to form an edge about 2/4
inch thick; try to keep edge even, smooth and slightly away from the
edge of pan.) Prick sides and bottom of crust with a fork. Bake for
20 minutes, remove from oven and reduce temperature to 350 degrees.
Filling: Heat 1 teaspoon water or oil in a skillet over medium heat.
Add onion and saute for 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute for 30
seconds. Add broccoli florettes and 1 to 2 tablespoons water, then
cover. Steam until broccoli is bright green and slightly tender but
not soft, about 2 minutes. Drain vegetables if necessary; place in
prebaked pie crust and spread evenly over bottom. In a blender or
food processor, whip tofu, mustard, basil or rosemary, nutmeg, salt,
pepper and nutritional yeast. Blend 1 to 2 minutes, until very
smooth. Pour tofu mixture over vegetables in pie crust. Place red
pepper or black olives on top if desired. Bake 40 minutes, until
slightly puffy. Allow to cool 5 to 10 minutes before slicing. Serves
6. Variation: substitute 3 cups of any vegetable for the broccoli.
Try lightly steamed asparagus, sauteed mushrooms and leeks, or red
pepper and zucchini. Veganized version of classic tofu recipe in
