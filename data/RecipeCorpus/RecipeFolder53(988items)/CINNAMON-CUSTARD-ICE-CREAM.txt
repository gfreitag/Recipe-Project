Title: CINNAMON CUSTARD ICE CREAM
Categories: Ice cream
Yield: 1 Quart
2 c  Milk
2 c  Heavy cream
3/4 c  Sugar
2 lg Cinnamon sticks
3    Egg yolks; beaten
In a medium-sized, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the milk, cream,
sugar, and cinnamon sticks. Heat the mixture until it simmers,
stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and leave to
steep, covered, for 2-3 hours. You can leave the cinnamon to soak in
the cream mixture even longer if you want a more defined cinnamon
flavor.

Heat the liquid again to just below a simmer. Stir a ladle of the hot
liquid into the egg yolks, then whisk the yolks into the cream
mixture. Continue stirring over very low heat, never allowing the
mixture to boil, until the custard thickens, about 8-10 minutes.

Pour the custard into another container and allow it to cook, then
chill it. Remove the cinnamon sticks, strain the custard if needed,
and freeze it in an ice cream freezer accoridng to manufacturer's
instructions.
