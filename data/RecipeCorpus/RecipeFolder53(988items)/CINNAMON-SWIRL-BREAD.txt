Title: CINNAMON SWIRL BREAD
Categories: Digest, July, Ovo lacto
Yield: 2 Servings
6    7 c all-purpose flour
2 pk Yeast
2 c  Milk (what ever version you
Use - I use 1/2%)
1/4 c  Sugar(I used an unrefined
Granulated sugar I get at my
FS)
1/4 c  Applesauce
2 ts Salt
6    Egg whites
x  Cinnamon and sugar mix (1 c
Sugar to 4 teaspoons
Cinnamon)
Raisons if desired
~ Mix 3 cups flour and yeast in large bowl. - Warm milk, sugar,
applesauce, salt over stove until warm to touch (115deg). When warm
mix into flour mixture, ADD EGGS and beat at high speed for three
minutes. - Stir in as much of the remaining flour as possible.  (I
stired in 3 cups.) - Turn out on floured board and knead in as much
of the rest of the flour as possible to make a soft elastic dough. -
Put in greased bowl and let rise. (I used a touch of lf spray oil and
covered with a wet papertowel. Terry cloth will stick and make a
mess.) Let rise until double (about 1 1/4 hours). - Punch down.
Divide in half.  Let rest 20 minutes. - Roll out into a15"X7"
rectangle (I used slightly larger because I have 9" loaf pans.) Wet
surface slightly with water and sprinkle with 1/2 cinnamon mixture,
make sure to get close to edges. - Sprinkle with raisons if desired.
Roll up like a jelly roll and tuck edges under. Put in sprayed loaf
pan and let rise until double, about 30-40 minutes.  Bake at 375 deg
about 45 minutes or until done.  (Once the bread gets nice and brown,
cover with foil and cook another 15 minutes.)  Let cool some before
cutting.
