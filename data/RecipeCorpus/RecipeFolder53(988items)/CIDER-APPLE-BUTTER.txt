Title: CIDER APPLE BUTTER
Categories: Sauces, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 1 Servings
5 lb Apples, cooking type
1    Lemon; juice & grated peel
1    Orange; juice & grated peel
2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Allspice
1/4 ts Cloves
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1 1/2 c  Apple cider
3 c  Brown sugar
Core and quarter apples, but do not peel.  Place in crockpot with
apple cider.  Cook on high until very soft, about 1 1/2 hours. Put
cooked apples in blender or food processor, and puree. Measure,
(there should be about 6 cups). For every cup fruit pulp, allow 1/2
cup brown sugar. Return to crock pot.  Stir in lemon and orange peel
and juice, cinnamon, allspice, cloves and nutmeg.  Cover.  Cook on
high until thick and dark, about 4 hours. At this point you can put
it into hot sterilzed glasses and seal, freeze it it batches or
refrigerate and use within a couple of weeks. We usually refrigerate
since it goes quick around here.
