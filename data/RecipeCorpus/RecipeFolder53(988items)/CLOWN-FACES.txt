Make the pancakes in advance and set them in oven to keep them warm.
Poach or fry the eggs. To assemble the faces, place the pancakes on a
plate, with eggs for eyes, orange slices for ears and mouth, and a
tomato half for the nose. NOTE: For a lighter meal, omit the eggs and
use apricot or peach halves for eyes and half a fresh cherry for a
nose. Or, omit pancakes, assemble eggs directly on plate, and add a
smile made from chopped, sauted potatoes.
