Title: CLEM'S BAKED BEANS
Categories: Improv, Kohl, Side dish
Yield: 20 Servings
Pork & beans
Onions, diced
Brown sugar
Honey
Catsup or Picante sauce
Bacon strips (optional)
Into a large oblong baking pan add enough pork and beans (or
precooked navy beans) to fill the pan.  Dice up about 1/2 small onion
per can of beans. Add about 1/4 cup of brown sugar per can of beans.
Add about 1/4 cup of honey per can of beans.  Add about 1/2 cup of
catsup and/or Picante sauce (the more, the hotter...but yummie
good!). Stir it all to mix thoroughly, then add bacon strips to cover
the top.

Bake in a slow oven, about 300 degrees, for 2 hours or more.

NOTE:  Can be started the night before by putting the beans in a 325
degree oven for 30 minutes, then turn the heat down to 200. Let cook
for 8 hours or more.
