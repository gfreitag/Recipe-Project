In a heavy soup pot, saute onion, green pepper, celery, carrot, and
garlic in olive oil until soft.

Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, basil,  bay leaf, salt and pepper. Heat to
boiling, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered for 2 hours. Remove and
discard bay leaf.

Add the halibut, shrimp, scallops and wine, simmer 10 minutes.

Place clams and fish in pot and steam 5 - 10 minutes until the clams
open and the fish is flaky.*

Serve in soup bowls, sprinkled with parsley, accompanied by French or
sourdough bread.

*I have found it easier to steam the clams open separately and add
them to the soup.
