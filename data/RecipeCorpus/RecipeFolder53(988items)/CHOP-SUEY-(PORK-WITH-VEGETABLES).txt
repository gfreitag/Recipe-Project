Title: CHOP SUEY (PORK WITH VEGETABLES)
Categories: Pork
Yield: 4 Servings
2 ts Oil
2 c  Cold diced roast pork
2    Carrots; pared, sliced thin
-diagonally
1    Kohlrabi, peeled, quartered,
-sliced thin
1    Onion, diced
1    Chinese vegetables, mixed, c
-anned; drained
3 ts Soy sauce
Water
Salt
Rice; cooked
# Note:  Fresh vegetables may be substituted for the canned Chinese
vegetables. Use about 2 to 3 cups of a combination of thinly sliced
green or sweet red pepper, celery, mushrooms, etc. plus a cup or so
of bean sprouts. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet. Add the pork and
cook, stirring, over high heat for about 1 minute or until any bits
of fat on the pork are crisp. Add vegetables, soy sauce, and a couple
of tablespoons of water and toss to mix.  Cover skillet and cook over
medium heat only until carrots and turnip are crisp-tender. This will
take less than 10 minutes if the vegetables have been cut thinly
enough. Stir in 2 tb. cornstarch mixed with about 1 cup of water to
make a sauce and cook for a minute or less, stirring gently, until
thickened. Serve with rice. Adapted from: _The Plan-Ahead Cookbook_
