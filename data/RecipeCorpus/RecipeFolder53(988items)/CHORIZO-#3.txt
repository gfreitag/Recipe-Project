Categories: Meat
Yield: 24 Servings

3 tb Red chili powder
3 tb Salt
2 tb Hot paprika
1 tb Minced garlic
1 tb Dried red chili flakes

(Bon Appetit, May 1986)

Combine pork, chili powder, salt, paprika, garlic, chili flakes and
oregano in large bowl. Cover mixture and marinate in refrigerator
overnight.

Soak casings in cold water mixed with distilled vinegar 1 hour.
Rinse. Slip one end of casing over faucet and run cold water through.
Clip out or tie closed any sections with holes. Soak in cold water
while preparing filling.

Coarsely grind pork misture in meat grinder or processor. Return to
bowl. Make well in center of meat mixture. Add tequila and red wine
vinegar to well; knead into meat.

Attach stuffing horn to grinder. (casing can also be stuffed with
pastry bag fitted with 1/2 inch plain tip, or a kitchen store will
have a small metal sausage stuffing horn for a few dollars). Wring
out casings and place one end over horn. Gradually push all of casing
onto horn, leaving 6 inch overhang. Tie knot in overhang. With one
hand, feed meat mixture into grinder. Meanwhile, anchor casing on top
of horn with thumb of other hand, allowing casing to unroll as
mixture is extruded. Stop occasionally to mold meat. Pierce any air
bubbles with fine needle. Do not pack too full or sausage will burst
as filling expands during cooking. Remove horn and knot casing. Knot
3 inch pieces of string around sausage at 4 inch intervals. Cut into
individual sausages. Place on paper-towel lined pan and refrigerate
uncovered overnight.
