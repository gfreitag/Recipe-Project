Categories: Condiments, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Mustards, Spreads
Yield: 1 Batch
1/2 c  Mustard seed; light or dark
3 tb Dry mustard powder*
-- lightly packed
2/3 c  ;Water
3/4 c  White wine vinegar or
3/4 c  Oriental rice vinegar
3 tb Mild-flavored honey or
2 tb White corn syrup plus
1 tb Strongly flavored honey
2 ts Salt
2 tb Chopped fresh tarragon** or
2 ts Dried tarragon; crumbled
*Preferably Colman's.

**Or more to taste of either the fresh or dried tarragon.

If using a spice mill, grind the mustard seed in it to the texture of
coarse meal.  Stir the ground seed with the mustard powder and water
and set it aside, uncovered, for at least 2 hours or as long as
overnight, giving it a stir when you think of it.

If using a blender or food processor to do the grinding, combine the
seed, mustard powder and water in the container; process everything
to a coarse puree.  Set the mixture aside as described.

Combine the mustard mixture with the vinegar, honey, salt and
tarragon. Process the mixture in a blender or food processor to the
texture that suits you, from slightly coarse to creamy.

Store in a clean, dry jar, tightly capped, at room temperature if you
would like it to mellow gradually, or refrigerate it at once to
retain maximum hotness. It can be used at once, but a few days' rest
in the jar will allow the flavor to develop.  After the mustard has
rested for a day or two, taste it and decide whether to add more
tarragon, honey or vinegar. Good with summer picnic foods.

Yield: About 2 cups.  Keeps indefinitely, either at room temperature
or in the refrigerator.
