Title: CIMA ALLA GENOVESE INFO
Categories: Veal, Afghani
Yield: 12 Servings
Info
Because Cima alla Genovese has so many ingredients and direction
lines, I've had to split it up into three different recipes for
import. This is one of my favorite recipes for impressing guests
because it is relatively easy, yet it looks so tempting difficult to
do.

Please be sure to collect all three recipes before you begin
cooking or you'll be sorely disappointed.... <smiling>:

Cima alla Genovese I (Stuffing)
Cima alla Genovese II (Salsa Verde)
Cima alla Genovese III (Assembly)
