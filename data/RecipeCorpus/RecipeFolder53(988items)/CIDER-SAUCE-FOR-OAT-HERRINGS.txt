1 oz Flour
10 fl Cider or apple juice

Salt and pepper as desired
Melt butter, add flour and cook for 2-3 minutes so that the raw
flavor of the flour has time to mellow. Remove from heat and slowly
add the cider, stirring all the time. Season to taste, bring to the
boil, and cook for a few minutes.  Remove from heat again, add the
milk or cream, and reheat carefully. Serve in a hot sauce boat.
