"This recipe..appeared in the Toronto Star many years ago as a result
of a contest to create a sauce similar to Swiss Chalet's barbecue
sauce. Home economist Kay Spicer created the winning recipe."

Anne's note: Swiss Chalet is a chain of Canadian chicken restaurants.
This sauce is brushed on the chicken before cooking and served at the
table in small containers to dip the chicken pieces in.

Pour cups of water and tomato juice into 1 1/2 qt saucepan. Add
bouillon cube, paprika, sugar, salt, basil, parsley, poultry
seasoning, thyme, ginger, mustard, onion powder, bay leaf,
Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco. Stir well or whisk to mix. Bring to
a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes. Remove bay leaf. Stir
in lemon juice.

Mix cornstarch and 1 Tbsp water to smooth paste. Add to mixture and
cook, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes until sauce thickens.
Whisk in oil.
