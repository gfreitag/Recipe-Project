HEAT ALL INGREDIENTS EXCEPT LEEKS TO BOILING. REDUCE HEAT, COVER, AND
SIMMER 30 MIN. ADD LEEKS AND HEAT TO BOILING. REDUCE HEAT, COVER, AND
SIMMER 10-15 MIN.
Note: I use MUCH less chicken than this.  Makes a thick soup, almost
like a stew. 02, 1993 D.WEISSGERBE [RICK W] at 07:09 EDT

Hello to you too Sylvia!

Not new ... just not a frequent poster <G>. I'm in the process of
moving my data base over to Meal-Master (Compu-Chef just got too
unstable when the count went over 6000) and cleaning things up. 02,
