Title: CLOTTED CREAM PART 1
Categories: Desserts
Clotted cream is a traditional product of South West England and
Yield: 1 Serving
the traditional farmhouse method of manufacture is as follows:

1.  Channel Island milk is placed in shallow pans or bowls and left
until the cream rises to the top.

2.  The milk is then scalded for about one hour by placing the pan or
bowl over a pan of water maintained at a temperature of about 180^F
(82^C).

3.  The cream is ready when it is straw colored and wrinkled in
appearance. It is then cooled overnight or for about twelve hours.

4.  When cool the cream should be skimmed off the surface using a
perforated skimmer or a shallow spoon.

5.  If the skimmed cream is left in the refrigerator for a few hours
it will thicken further.

Alternatively, clotted cream can be made using the direct scald
method. Double cream is placed in shallow pans or bowls and scalded
as for the traditional method. After scalding and cooling the whole
contents of the pan are used as clotted cream.
