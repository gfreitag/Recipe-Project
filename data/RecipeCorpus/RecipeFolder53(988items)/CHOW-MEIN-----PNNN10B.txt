Title: CHOW MEIN
Categories: Chinese, Main dish
1 lb Pork -- cut in thin strips
Yield: 4 Servings
3 c  Celery -- thin sliced
1 c  Onion -- sliced
6 oz Can mushrooms -- drained
3 TB Cornstarch
1/4 c  Water
10 oz Chicken broth
1/4 c  Soy sauce -- light
5 c  Water chestnuts -- drained

In hot deep skillet or wok, brown meat in 1 tsp. oil. Remove from
pan. Add 1 tsp. oil to pan and cook celery and onion until crisp
tender. Add mushrooms.  Blend cornstarch into water and when smooth
add chicken broth and  soy sauce.  Put meat back into pan with
veggies and add bean sprouts and  water chestnuts. Pour sauce over
all and heat through. Serve over chow mein noodles with steamed rice
on the side.  Note: to cut down on sodium I rinse all canned
vegetables well. If you like you can add chopped green peppers, fresh
mushrooms and thin sliced cabbage when stir frying the vegetables.
You can also use chicken or beef if you prefer not touse pork. I
like pork because that's the way my mom always made this recipe.FROM:
