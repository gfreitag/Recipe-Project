Categories: Candies
Yield: 30 Servings
MMMMM----------------------HAZELNUT PRALINE---------------------------
1 c  Whole hazelnuts
1 c  Sugar
MMMMM--------------------------TRUFFLES-------------------------------
8 oz Semisweet chocolate;
-finely chopped
1/2 c  Unsalted butter; chilled and
-cut into 8 pieces
3 tb Brewed coffee
1 tb Hazelnut liqueur (Frangelico
2/3 c  Hazelnut Praline
Unsweetened cocoa powder
MMMMM--------------------------COATING-------------------------------
12 oz Semisweet chocolate;
-finely chopped
6 tb Hazelnut praline
Make the praline: 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the
hazelnuts on a baking sheet. Toast for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the
smell permeates the air. To see if the nuts are toasted, cut one in
half; it should be golden brown in the center. Remove from the oven
and let cool slightly. To remove the skins, place the nuts on a towel
and rub; the skins will slip off.

2. Lightly oil a sheet of foil; set aside.

3. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the sugar, stirring
occasionally. It should start to melt after about 6 minutes. The
sugar will be lumpy and granular, and look like a mistake.
Persevere!. Within the next few minutes, those lumps will melt into a
smooth, amber-colored liquid. Lower the heat and stir in the toasted
hazelnuts, coating the nuts thoroughly. The mixture will be very
sticky. Immediately scrape the mixture with a metal spoon (do not use
a rubber spatula) onto the foil, spreading it out. Use a metal spoon
dipped in water to flatten it. The praline will become brittle and
difficult to pour as soon as you remove it form the heat, and you
will not be able to scrape every last drop from the pan -- don't
worry. (To clean the pan, soak it in hot, soapy water. The sugar will
dissolve.)

4. Let the praline cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Break
it into pieces and put it in a food processor. Pulse to chop as
finely as possible into a lumpy powder. You should have 2 cups; the
praline can keep idefinitely in an airtight container in the freezer.

Make the truffles: 5. In a microwave-safe medium bowl, combine the
chopped chocolate and the butter. Heat on high for 1 minute. Stir
until smooth. If the chocolate is still fairly solid, heat for
another 30 seconds. Stir the mixture until smooth. If there still
seem to be several unmelted pieces of chocolate, heat again for about
20 seconds, and then stir.

6. Add the coffee and hazelnut liqueur and stir until smooth.

7. Add the hazelnut praline and mix in thoroughly.
