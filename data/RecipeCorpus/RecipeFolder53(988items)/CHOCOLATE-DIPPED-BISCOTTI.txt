Title: CHOCOLATE-DIPPED BISCOTTI
Categories: Cookies, Italian, Davidson
Yield: 48 Biscotti
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Butter, sweet; melted &
-cooled
2 tb Pernod
1 1/2 tb Bourbon
2 tb Anise seed
3 lg Egg
1 c  Almonds; chopped
2 1/4 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
12 oz Chocolate chips; semi-sweet
2 tb Shortening
In a large mixing bowl, stir together the sugar and melted butter.
Add the Pernod, bourbon and anise seed. Beat in the eggs, then stir
in the nuts. Sift the dry ingredients together. Gently stir in the
dry ingredients until well incorporated.  Cover with plastic wrap and
chill for about three hours.

Preheat the oven to 375 F.  Butter two cookie sheets. Shape the dough
on cookie sheets into three loaves, well spaced. Each loaf should be
about two inches wide and 1/2" thick. Bake for about 20 minutes,
until the loaves puff up and brown.

When the loaves are cool enough to touch, cut each loaf into diagonal
slices about 1/2" thick.  Lay the slices on their cut sides and toast
them at 375 F. for an additional 15 minutes or until lightly browned.
Cool.

Dip biscotti in chocolate the day they are to be served. In the top
of a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips with the shortening,
stirring frequently.  (If you're *really* ambitious, add a little
chocolate wax to get a good do on it.)  Remove from heat and stir
until a candy thermometer read 85 F. Holding each cookie by its
bottom, gently dip the tops into chocolate.  Turn immediately and
allow to dry, uncoated side down, on wax paper.  Repeat until all are
done.
