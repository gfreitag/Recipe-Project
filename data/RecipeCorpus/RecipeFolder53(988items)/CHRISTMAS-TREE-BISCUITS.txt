Preheat oven to 190'C (375'F). Grease two baking sheets. Sift the
flour, bicarbonate of soda and spice into a bowl. Rub the butter into
the flour until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the
sugar. Add the golden syrup and egg and mix to form a dough. Gently
knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth, the roll out to
1/4 inch thick. Use christmas cutters to cut out 16 shapes. Lift
shapes on to baking sheets and bake until just firm to the touch.
Make a hole large enough for gold thread at the top of each biscuit.
Transfer to cooling rack and leave until cold. To decorate, roll out
fondant icing on a clean surface dusted with icing sugar. Cut out
shapes with cutters and place on biscuits, securing them with a
little water. Make a hole for thread as before. Decorate with piped
glace icing, silver balls, sweets or coconut. Thread each biscuit
with gold thread and hang on Christmas tree, if liked.
