Sprinkle yeast over warm water; stir to dissolve.  Add molasses, then

beaten egg white. Allow to rise 30-40 minutes. Stir in first of the
unbleached flour (A) until blended; beat 10 minutes. Cover bowl, set
in warm place and let rise about 1 hour 20 minutes. Fold in melted
butter and salt. Add pastry flour and additional unbleached flour

together in one piece, turn out onto floured surface. With floured
hands, knead dough, adding flour and reflouring board as needed.
Knead until smooth and somewhat shiny. Place dough in oiled bowl,
roll dough to oil top, and cover with towel. Let rise until doubled
in size. After dough has risen, roll out to 12" x 14" (if making 16
rolls; figure 3/4" x 14" for each roll when scaling). Spread with
soft butter. Sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon and raisins. Roll up
(crimp edges to roll).  Cut into 3/4" sections.  Lay rolls flat on
oiled cookie sheets and let rise 30 minutes. Mix egg with water and
brush over rolls. Bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. Makes 16 rolls
