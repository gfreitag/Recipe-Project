Categories: Chinese, Chicken
Yield: 4 Servings
4 c  Chicken broth
2 c  Diced celery
1 c  Diced onion
1 c  Chopped cabbage (bok choy if
-available)
2 tb Peanut oil
1 1/2 c  Sliced fresh mushrooms
1 1/2 c  Fresh bean sprouts
2 tb Dark molasses
1 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Butter
2    Eggs, beaten
4    To 5 Tbl cornstarch
1 lb Cooked, boned chicken, torn
-into bite-size shreds
1 cn Chow mein noodles
In a saucepan, bring the chicken broth to simmer.  Add the celery,
onion, and cabbage.  Simmer, stiring occasionally, until the celery
is soft.

Heat the peanut oil in a large skillet or wok.  Saute the mushrooms
until they begin to soften.  Add the bean sprouts; cook and stir
until they are soft.  Use a slotted spoon to place the celery, onion,
and cabbage in the skillet.  Add the molasses and soy sauce. Stir and
cook, adding enough broth to keep it moist and loose.

Melt the butter in a small pan over medium-high heat. Cook the eggs
until firm, with minimal stirring.  You want an "egg pancake". Remove
the eggs from the pan, season to taste, and slice into thin strips.

Dissolve the cornstarch in the remaining chicken broth. Stir into the
vegetables in the wok, and stir as the mixture thickens. Add torn
chicken and heat through.

To serve, put a layer of chow mein noodles on each plate and heap
with the chicken and vegetable mixture. Top with the shreds of eggs.
