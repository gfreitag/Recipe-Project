Red Delicious is the world's most popular apple.  Over 150 different
strains of Red Delicious are grown commercially. They are bright to
dark red color, sometimes stripped. Red Delicious apples are also
easily recognized by the distinctive knob at the base. The flavor is
sweetly mild and the aroma distinctly apple-y. The flesh is
fine-grained, juicy and crunchy.  Red Delicious apples are America's
favorite snacking apple and are perfect for salads.

Sprinkle apple cubes with sugar, lemon juice and salt. Add celery and
nuts. Fold mayonnaise into whipped cream. Fold gently in lettuce
lined bowl.
