Many thanks to Laurie from Virginia.  Laurie sent me a recipe for
cinnamon-pineapple sauce that I made the other day. It was
incredible... even better than the one I had at that restaurant...
and VERY EASY!

Combine ingredients in 2 qt. saucepan.  Cook over medium high heat,
stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and heated through,
about 3 ~ 5 minutes. I used this sauce for dipping chicken nuggets
into.

Thanks again, Laurie!!!
