***Excerpt from "Square Meals": "No one who loves to eat can visit
Cincinnati without falling in love with the most eccentric and
delicious noodle dish of all--5-Way Chili. Invented by Greek
immigrants in the 1920s, it is unique to southern Ohio, and served
only in chili parlors, most of which are fluorescent-lighted
luncheonettes that haven't changed much since 1950. Nobody in
Cincinnati gives out their recipe. It is a dish of startling
complexity, so dizzingly spicy..." THIS IS A 2 PART RECIPE. Salt a
large cast iron skillet. Turn heat to med and add meat, onions, and
garlic. Cook until meat is browned. Add tomato sauce, catsup, water,
and vinegar. As mixture begins to boil, add everything else. Adjust
spices to taste, adding more salt if it needs perking up, turmeric
and cumin for a sweatier chili flavor, cinnamon, cloves, and mace if
you want it sweeter, cardamom for more bang, unsweetened chocolate
for body. Cover and simmer at very low heat for about 1 hr, stirring
and tasting occasionally, adding tomato juice if it is getting too
dry to ladle up easily.
