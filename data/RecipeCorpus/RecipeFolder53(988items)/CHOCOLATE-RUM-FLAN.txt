-14.5oz
1 cn Evaporated milk, 12 oz
2    Eggs

Heat the sugar in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat,
stirring constantly until the sugar has melted and is a light amber

ramekins or molds, or a 9x4 inch loaf pan. Pour the flan mixture over
the caramel. Place in a water bath and bake uncovered for 15 minutes.
Reduce heat to 350 degrees F and continue baking until set, when a

the oven and let cool completely. To serve: Run a knife around the
edges of the ramekins or mold and invert the flans onto a serving
platter or individual plates.
