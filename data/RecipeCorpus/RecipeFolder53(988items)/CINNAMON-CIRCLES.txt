Title: CINNAMON CIRCLES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Butter softened
2/3 c  Powdered sugar
1 ts Pure vanilla extract
2 c  All purpose flour unsifted
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Semisweet/milk chocolate

In a large mixing bowl with electric mixer set at high speed, beat
butter until smooth; gradually add sugar; beat until light and
fluffy. Beat in vanilla. In a medium bowl combine flour, cinnamon,
baking powder, and salt. Add to butter mixture, beating until just
combined; cover bowl. Chill dough until firm but not hard, about 30
minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Shape dough into 3/4 inch balls
using 1 tablespoon dough for each. Place on ungreased cookie sheets 2
1/2 inches apart. Using the bottom of a floured glass, press each
ball into a 2 inch circle. Bake until just golden around the edge,
about 6 minutes. Do not over bake. Remove from baking sheets to a
wire rack; cool completely. In a small saucepan over very low heat
melt chocolate morsels, stirring constantly. Frost half of each
cookie using a small spatula. Place on a rack to set. Refrigerate in
a tightly covered container.
