Yield: 999 Servings
1 pk Whole almonds with skin on
2    Egg whites
2 tb Cold water
2 c  Powdered sugar
1/2 c  Cornstarch
1/2 c  Cinnamon
Dash of salt
Preheat oven to 250 degrees.

Beat egg whites and cold water to a slight froth.  Add almonds to egg
whites and soak to coat well, about 15 minutes. Drain almonds in a
colander (but don't let them dry out, they should be damp).

Sift together the powdered sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon and salt, three
times.  Coat the almonds iwth the cinnamon-sugar mixture. An easy way
to do this is to place the sifted cinnamon mixture into a small paper
bag and drop inthe almonds, a few at at ime, hold bag closed and
remove from bag with a slottted spoon, place on cookie sheet,
continuing until all almonds are coated.

Place on an ungreased cookie sheet, in a single layer and bake for 2
1/2 to 3 hours, taste for doneness but do not let them get too brown.
