stirring occasionally to prevent scorching; add chicken, boned and
diced, and the seasonings; mix well and remove from heat; let cool to

Brunswick stew benefits from long slow cooking. In some homes,
it is a rule that the stew cannot be eaten the day it is made. The
flavor will always
improve with age.
