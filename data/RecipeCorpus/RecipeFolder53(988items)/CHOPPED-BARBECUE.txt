Recipe by: Sylvia Woods Preparation Time: 2:00 1) Rinse the pork
roast and pat it dry with paper towels. Combine the red pepper, salt,
and black pepper.  Rub the mixture into all sides of the pork Cover
loosely with wax paper and refrigerate overnight.

2)  Place the seasoned pork in a shallow roasting pan and let stand
at room temperature 1 hour.

3)  Preheat the oven to 300oF.  Pour the vinegar to taste over the
pork (more for a sharper flavor, less for a more mellow flavor).
Scatter the chopped onions and green peppers into the pan. Roast the
meat until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast
registers 180oF. S roast and let stand 1 hour. Keep the pan juices.

4)  Remove the meat from the bone, if necessary, and chop it into
roughly 1/4-inch pieces.  Heat the barbecue sauce in a large saucepan
over a low heat until hot. Skim the fat from the pan drippings and
add the drippings to the barbecue sauce.  Stir the pork, onions and
green peppers into the sauce and warm without boiling until heated
through. Serve hot.
