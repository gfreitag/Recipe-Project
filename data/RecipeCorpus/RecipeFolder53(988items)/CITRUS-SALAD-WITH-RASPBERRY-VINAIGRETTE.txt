2 tb Oil, sesame
2 tb Oil, walnut
4 tb Veinegar, raspberry
1 ts Honey OR
1 ts Sugar, brown
The orange, grapefruit, and asian pear should be peeled, sectioned
and all of the membrane should be removed.

Any mixed greens that you would like to eat "raw" can be mixed and
placed in a mound in the middle of a round plate (individual serving).
Around this mound of greens, arrange alternating slices of pear,
orange and grapefruit.

To add a variety of flavors and textures to the salad, toss in any
desired amount of any or all of the following: thin slices of water
chestnut, julienne strips of purple onion, little bits of candied
ginger, and toasted walnuts.

For the dressing, mix all of the ingredients together in a
blender, or whisk them together vigorously. If you like a little
sweetness to your vinaigrette dressings, add a little honey, or a
little brown sugar and mix in thoroughly.

Drizzle the dressing over the salad and serve.
