Mix crumbs; 2 tbs. sugar; and butter.  Press over bottom and 1/2
inch up sides of a 9 inch cheesecake pan with removable rim. Bake in
a 350 degree oven until lightly browned, 10 minutes. Beat cheese,
sour cream, eggs, remaining sugar, peel, juice, and flour until
smooth. Pour into crust. Bake in 350 degree oven until center jiggles
only slightly when pan is gently shaken, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool;
spread with topping. Cover and chill until cold, at least 4 hours or
up to the next day. Top with lime slices and enjoy.

TOPPING Mix 1 cup light or regular sour cream and 2 tsp each sugar
and lime juice. That's all of the recipe folks. I hope you enjoy it
in good health if you decide to make it! FROM: P FRISCHKNECHT
