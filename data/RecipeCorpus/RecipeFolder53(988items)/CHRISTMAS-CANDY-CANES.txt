Categories: Candies, Holiday
Yield: 1 Servings
-Miles Kimball
3 c  Sugar
1 ts Peppermint flavoring
1/2 c  Water
3/4 c  Lt. corn syrup
3/4 ts Red vegetable coloring
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
Any self-respecting Christmas tree has a right to complain If it isn't
decked out with a candy cane. The sugar, water, syrup, and cream of
tartar you combine and heat till the sugar's dissolved real fine.
Divide into two saucepans, boil, but don't stir, please, Until each
lot 280 degrees. Add 1/2 ts peppermint to each lot and add the
coloring to one, the other not: place on an enamel or marble table to
cool. (First oiling the table, as a general rule). Like taffy you
stretch and pull and form into ropes of red and white, now twist them
around again and again.
And form them into your candy cane.
Now on an oiled surface you allow them to harden, then announce to
your family that these is ready for your Christmas tree. FROM:
