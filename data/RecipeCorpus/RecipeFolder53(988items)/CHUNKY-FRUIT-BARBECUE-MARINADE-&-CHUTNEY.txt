Yield: 8 Servings
16 sm Shallots -- peeled and

1 1/4 c  Dry white wine
4 md Apricots -- pitted and
Chopped
2 lg Peaches -- pitted and

In a small saucepan, combine shallots and wine; bring to a boil over
high heat. Reuce heat to medium low and let simmer, uncovered, until
shallots are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Combine remaining ingredients
in a large saucepan, add shallots and wine, and bring to a boil over
high heat. Reduce heat to medium; cook until fruits have broken down
but are still somewhat chunky, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool. Transfer
half of the sauce to a food processor and puree. Use this as a
marinade (and to baste with while grilling). Serve the other half as
a chutney.
