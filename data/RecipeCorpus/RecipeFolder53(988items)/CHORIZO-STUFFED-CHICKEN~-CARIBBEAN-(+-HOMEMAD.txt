1. Throughly wash and dry the chicken breasts 2. Cut a slit in the
thickest part to put in the chorizo sausage. Divide the sausage among
the breasts. 3. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven until hot, put in the
stuffed chicken breasts, (you can keep them together with toothpicks)
and brown on all sides.  About 10 min.? drain fat. 4. Add all of the
remaining ingredients. Heat to boiling, reduce heat, cover and simmer
until chicken is tender. 5. Remove bay leaves. Arrange the chicken
breasts on a large platter and serve with  the remaining sauce.  I'd
serve with rice or hot cooked black beans. Now for homemade Chorizo!
Secret. Don't buy it at the Supers! There are mystery ingredients
that you probably wouldn't want to eat. Easy to make, double, and
freeze for meatballs.
