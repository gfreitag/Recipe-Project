The long, slow cooking of sauerkraut with pork spareribs and kielbasa
mellows the sharp flavor of sauerkraut. Dark rye bread and a crunchy
salad are all that is needed to complete this meal.

Cut ribs between bones into single pieces. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. Brown ribs in oil in large skillet. Remove ribs. Add
garlic, bacon and onion to skillet and saute until onion turns
golden, stirring occasionally.

Stir in sauerkraut, carrots and caraway seeds. Spoon sauerkraut into
bottom os casserole to cover. Arrange half of ribs over sauerkraut
along with potatoes and kielbasa. Spoon remaining sauerkraut over top
of meat and vegetables. Top with remaining ribs. Pour over chicken
broth and white wine. Bake at 325'F. 2-3 hours or until ribs are
tender.
