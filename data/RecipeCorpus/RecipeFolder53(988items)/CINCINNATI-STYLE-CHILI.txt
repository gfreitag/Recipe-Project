Title: CINCINNATI-STYLE CHILI
Categories: Beef, Jvn, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Beef, ground
2 md Onions, chopped
2    Garlic cloves, minced
1 c  Thick barbecue sauce
1/2 c  Water
1 tb Chili powder
1 ts Black pepper
1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate,
Grated
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Tumeric
1/4 ts Allspice
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1/4 ts Ground coriander
1/4 ts Ground cardamon
1/2 ts Salt
Tomatoe juice, as needed
9 oz Spaghetti, cooked & lightly
Buttered
16 oz Can kidney beans
1 lb Cheddar cheese, finely
Shredded
Brown the meat with half the chopped onion and garlic, stirring to
keep it loose. (Set the remaining onion aside to top the chili when
its done). Drain any fat from the pan. Add barbecue sauce & water &
bring the pan to a boil. Simmer 30 min. stirring occasionally. The
chili will thicken as it cooks. Add tomatoe juice as necessary to
create a brew that ladles up easily. Allow the chili to rest at least
30 min in a covered pan at room temperature. (Chili can be
refrigerated & reheated to serve.) To make eash plate, start with a
layer of spaghetti & top it with hot chili, then a few beans, then
the reserved onions to taste. Pat on the cheese so the chili's heat
can begin to melt it. Serve immediately with oyster crackers.

I add the kidney beans just before the chili is finished cooking
instead of adding as a layer at serving time.
