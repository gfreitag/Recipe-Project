1/2 c  Bean sprouts
6    Snow peas

1    Garlic clove
2 tb Oil

Soak dried mushrooms. Slice roast pork, celery, cabbage and bamboo
shoots. Blanch bean sprouts. Stem snow peas. Shred ginger root and
crush garlic. Heat oil. Add ginger root and garlic; stir fry to brown
lightly. Add pork and stir fry a few times. Then add in sherry to
blend. Add all vegetables except snow peas and stir fry 1 minute
more. Add stock and heat quickly. Then cook,covered, 3 minutes over
medium heat. Stir in snow peas. Combine mixture with tossed noodles
(*See below) Variations: Substitute cooked beef,ham, chicken, duck,
crabmeat, lobster or shrimp. You can also add shredded green onion to
the garlic/ginger mixture. I use Shaoxing wine instead of sherry,
which is more authentic. *To cook noodles, prepare boiling water with
a little salt. Add noodles and cook until barely done. Drain and
rinse with cold water to stop cooking. Separate noodles with a fork,
then toss them with a little sesame oil or peanut oil and set aside
until they are ready to go into your stir-fry for the final heat. You
will want about a pound of noodles for the above recipe. This recipe
is simply a guideline for a dish that can be varied in a thousand
ways!
