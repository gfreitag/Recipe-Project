Peel onions and slice 1/8 inch thick, preferably in a food processor.
Melt butter in a 6-quart (or larger) stockpot.  Add onions; cook,
uncovered, over low heat for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. (The
long cooking time makes the onions mellow and sweet.) Stir in pepper,
paprika and bay leaf; saute over low heat 10 minutes more, stirring
frequently. Pour in 6 cans broth and wine.  Increase heat and bring
to a boil. Dissolve flour in remaining 1 can broth.  Stir into
boiling soup. Reduce heat and simmer slowly for 2 hours. Adjust color
to a rich brown with caramel coloring, season with salt. Refrigerate
overnight. To serve, heat soup in microwave or on stove top. If
desired, pour into ovenproof crocks or bowls. Top with a slice of
breat and a sprinkling of grated cheese. Heat under the broiler until
cheese melts and bubbles, about 5 minutes. Leftover soup can be
frozen. Yield: 4 quarts.
