Title: BASIC GUIDELINES FOR MAKING VEGETABLE STOCK
Categories: Soups
Yield: 8 Servings
2 qt Cold water
8 c  Vegetables -- cut into 1"
Pieces
First choose the ingredients to reflect the soup in which the broth is
being used. A general guideline for making vegetable broth is to use
about 8 to 12 cups of vegetables cut into pieces no bigger than 1
inch. Put these with 2 quarts of cold water in a large nonreactive
pot with no more than six different herbs. Bring to a boil over high
heat, then lower the heat and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Strain and
use as is or concentarte the flavor by simmering to the desired
strength (by taste).

When using dried herbs, lessen quantities by one-half to two-thirds
but always add *to taste*

NOTES : Stock is very personal. It's quickly prepared. Or make ahead
and freeze in a size that's convenient for you. -- Maggie Cabbage
family vegetables were left off the list of ingredients because they
give a strong (dominant) flavor; the flavor grows stronger (ages in
the freezer). If you like, use mild cabbages: napa, bok choy, a
little savoy, young brussels. Or use chard and endive. When using
cabbage, try to use the broth right away. Also, straining is
important.  Use a very fine sieve. -- Maggie and patH
