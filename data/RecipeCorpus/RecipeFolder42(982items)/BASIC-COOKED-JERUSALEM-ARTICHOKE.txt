Categories:
Yield: 6 Servings
Jerusalem artichokes
Lightly salted water
Fresh lemon juice
Salt and pepper
Jerusalem artichoke, also known as sunchoke, is a seasonal vegetable
that looks a bit like fresh ginger, and tastes like a cross between
potatoes and artichokes.  We enjoy it very much in Israel. To prepare
jerusalem artichokes as a side dish, peel and cook in boiling
lightly-salted water for 1/2 to 1 hour, covered, until soft. Add salt
and pepper to taste, and sprinkle with lemon juice.
