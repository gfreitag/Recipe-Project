I have a receipe for Banana-Walnut Bread which I found in my Better
Homes & Gardens Bread Machine Bounty. Add ingredients to machine
according to manufactrers directions, adding the banana with the
milk. (Use light setting, if available.)

I have not tried this receipe yet so let me know if its good or not.
