CAKE:  1.  Preheat oven to 350^  F.  Grease two 9" x 1 1/2" round
cake = pans.  Line the bottoms with parchment or wax paper. Grease
again and = flour. 2. In a food processor puree the bananas. Blend in

combine. Set aside. = Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda,
and salt in medium = mixing bowl. 3. In a large mixing bowl cream the
butter with an electric mixer until = smooth and light. Add 1/2 the
banana mixture and all the dry = ingredients. Mix on medium speed two
minutes until light and fluffy. = Add the rest of the wet mixture and
beat on high speed for one minute. = Fold in grated chocolate. 4.
Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, which should be =
half full. Bake for 30-32 minutes or just until a toothpick inserted
in = the center comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes. Run a
small, = metal spatula around the sides, then unmold and peel off the
paper = lining. Cool the cake to room temperature before assembling.
FROSTING: 1. Heat cream and chocolate in a heave saucepan over low =
heat, stirring occasionally to melt and blend the chocolate. Remove =
from the heat, stir in the powdered espresso, then pour into a clean
dry = container.  Once the cream reaches room temperture, cover
directly with = plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming. Chill in
the freezer until = very cold, about 1 hour, or refrigerate for up to
3 days. 2. Once the cake has cooled to room temperature, beat the
ganache (do = not use a whisk beater) on medium-low speed to soft
peaks.  Increase to = high speed and continue beating until the
frosting reaches a thick = spreading consistency. Spread the frosting
immediately, while it is = smooth. 3. Frost as desired for a festive
look:  spread 3/4 cup of frosting = between the layers and another
3/4 cup on top. Mask the sides with a = very thin layer. With a
pastry bag fitted with a large open star tip = pipe a continuous
vertical pattern all around the sides. Pipe stars = around the top of
the cake. Finished, the cake keeps refrigerated up to = 3 days. For
best results slice the cake chilled, but let sit 1/2 hour = at room
temperature before serving.
