1 ts Sugar
1 c  Warm water
2 tb Warm water (105F-to-115F)
3 c  Bread or unbleached flour

STIR YEAST AND SUGAR into water; let stand until foamy, about 5
minutes. For food processor fitted with metal blade or mixer with
dough hook, put remaining bread ingredients into bowl. Turn machine
on and slowly add yeast mixture. Mix until dough cleans sides of
bowl. If dough is too sticky, add more flour by the tablespoon,
working it in before adding more. If dough is dry and crumbly, add
more water by the teaspoon, working it in before adding more. Once
desired consistency is achieved (moist but not too sticky), mix dough
until well-kneaded, uniformly supple and elastic, about 40 seconds in
food processor, or 6 minutes in mixer. If mixing by hand, put
ingredients into large bowl and make well in center. Pour yeast
mixture into well and work into ingredients in bowl, then knead on
floured board until dough is elastic and smooth, about 10 minutes.
Transfer dough to large plastic bag, squeeze out air and seal top.
Place in bowl. Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1-to-1 1/2
hours. Oil 8-cup-capacity bread pan (9-inch). Punch dough down and
shape to fit pan. Cover loosely with plastic. Let rise in warm spot
until doubled, about 1 hour. 15 minutes before baking, put rack in
center of oven; set oven at 375F. When dough has doubled, brush top
with egg white. Bake until loaf is golden and sounds hollow when
rapped on bottom, about 35 minutes. Immediately remove loaf
