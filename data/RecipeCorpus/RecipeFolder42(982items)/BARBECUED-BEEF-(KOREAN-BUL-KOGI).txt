Title: BARBECUED BEEF (KOREAN BUL KOGI)
Categories: Main dish, Meats, Korean, Ethnic
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Sirloin Steak
3    Scallions
4    Cloves garlic
5 tb Soy Sauce
2 tb Sesame oil
1/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Sherry
1/4 c  Beef stock (optional)
1/8 ts Black pepper
1.  Slice the steak very thin on the bias. Score each piece with an X.

2.  Chop the scallions and crush the garlic. Combine these
ingredients with the remaining seasonings in a bowl. Add the meat to
the marinade and mix well until all sides of the steak are coated.

3.  The meat may be grilled immediately. The best results are
obtained if the steak is marinated for 2 hours. The marinade will
keep overnight

Variation: Use rib steak or flank steak.

Bul Kogi is so popular that many Koreans consider it the national meat
dish.  Serve with rice and kimchi.
