Title: BASIC CREME BRULEE-WASHINGTON POST
Categories: Dessert, France, Pudding
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Whipping cream
1/2 c  Sugar
1    Vanilla beans, split
Or
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
5    Egg yolks
Preheat oven to 325 F. Combine cream, half the sugar and vanilla in a
heavy saucepan and scald (bring just to a boil). Remove from heat. If
using a vanilla bean, cover and let infuse for 10 minutes, then
remove bean. Meanwhile, wisk the egg yolks with the rest of the sugar
until slightly thickened. Slowly wisk a small amount of the cream
mixture iinto the egg yolks. (This will warm the egg yolks and
prevent them from curdling.) When the yolks have warmed up , wisk the
yolk mixture back into the rest of the cream. Strain this cream
mixture into four 6 oz ovenproof ramekins. Put the ramekins into an
ovenproof pan and put it in the oven. Fill the pan 1/3 to 1/2 full of
water. Bake until barely set, about 40 to 45 minutes. (When gently
shaken, the custard should jiggle but not be too loose.) Remove
ramekins from water bath, wipe bottoms and chill in refrigerator
several hours to overnight. To serve: Spread an even layer of sugar
on each crreme brulee and melt the sugar carrefully with a small
propane torch. Allow sugar to harden for a few minutes, then serve.
To use a broiler instead of a torch, place ramekins in a large pan
surrounded by ice (this keeps the custard ffrom overcooking.) Broil
as close as possible to the heat source until the sugar melts and
caramelizes, about 2 to 3 minutes. Once the sugar has hardened serve
immediately.

NOTES : Creme Brulee originated in England.  It was later given a
French name.  Burnt cream doesn't sound as romantic. Recipe by:
