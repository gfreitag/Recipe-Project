Title: BASIC SOURDOUGH BREAD**
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Sourdough starter
2 1/2 c  Flour
2 c  Warm water
3 3/4    To 4-1/4 C flour
3 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking soda
3 tb Vegetable oil
Cold water

Mix 1 st 3 ingreds. in 3 qt. glass bowl with wooden spoon until
smooth. Cover; let stand in warm, draft-free place for 8 hours. Add
3-3/4 C flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and oil to the mixture in
bowl. Stir with wooden spoon until smooth and flour is completely
absorbed. (Dough should be just firm enough to gather into a ball. If
necessary, add remaining 1/2 C flour gradually, stirring until all
flour is absorbed.) Turn dough onto heavily floured surface; knead
until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl;
turn greased side up. Cover; let rise in warm place until double,
about 1-1/2 hours. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when
touched.) Punch dough down; divide into halves. Shape each half into
a round,  slightly flat loaf. Do not tear dough by pulling. Place
loaves in opposite corners of greased cookie sheet. Make three 1/4"
deep slashes in each loaf. Let rise until double, about 45 minutes.
Heat oven to 375. Brush loaves with cold water. Place cookie sheet in
center of oven; it should not touch the sides of the oven. Bake,
brushing occasionally with water, until loaves sound hollow when
tapped, about 50 minutes. Remove from cookie sheets; cool on wire
racks.

Be sure to let dough rise completely both times - it might take
longer than the estimated times given.
