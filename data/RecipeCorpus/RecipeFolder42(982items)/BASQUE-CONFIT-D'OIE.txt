Title: BASQUE CONFIT D'OIE
Categories: Spanish, Basque, Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
9 lb Fesh goose
3/4 lb Goose fat
3/4 lb Pork fat
1 1/2 c  Kosher salt
4    Bay leaves, broken
3 tb Fresh thyme leaves
3 ts Freshly ground pepper
1 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 ts Freshly ground cloves
15    Garlic gloves, peeled
( preserved goose in it's own fat )

Cut up goose, cutting thighs and back into two parts, and breast into
four. Remove wing tips and set aside.( Save for stock or soup )

Put fat (goose and pork) into large Dutch oven with 1/2 cup water and
cook on low heat until all fat has rendered.Discard scraps. Mix
together salt, herbs, and spices (excluding garlic).Rub goose pieces
with salt mixture, using entire amount. Put pieces in heavy plastic
bag, close tightly, and refrigerate for 2 days, turning bag often.
Remelt fat. Wipe goose pieces dry and put them in the melted fat in
Dutch oven.Add garlic and weight meat down with heavy plate.Put Dutch
oven on very low heat and cook very slowly for 1 1/2 hours.

Pour 1 inch of cooking fat into the bottom of a clean dry crock and
allow fat to harden.Pack partly cooled pieces of goose into crock and
then strain cooking fat over pieces. A thick layer of fat should
cover the pieces of goose and there should be no air spaces between
meat pieces.Cover tightly and refrigerate.Keeps up to 1 year.

A pice of confit ( with a little of the fat) is good added to a stew
or casserole as a flavor booster. It is also good served, in small
portions, warmed over low heat, and poured over mashed potatoes or
rice.
