Title: BASIC WHITE SAUCE WITH MILK (BECHAMEL)
Categories: Sauces, Low fat
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Nonfat milk
sm Piece of onion (about 1
TAB)
2 tb Grated carrot
1/8 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
1/8 ts White pepper
2 tb Instant nonfat dry milk
1 tb Cornstarch or arrowroot
2 tb Flour
In a small saucepan combine milk, onion, carrot, nutmeg and pepper.
Bring to a boil, then cover, remove from heat and allow to steep for
ten minutes. Pour the warm milk through a strainer, pressing down on
the vegetables to obtain all the juices. Let cool. Combine dry milk,
cornstarch or arrowroot and flour. Add one or two TAB cooled milk to
the dry mixture and stir to a smooth paste. Return the milk to the
saucepan, add the flour paste and stir over medium heat until mixture
boils and thickens. If sauce will not be used immediately, cover and
refrigerate. Cold sauce will thicken; thin with a little flavored
cooking juice, wine or stock. Makes about 1 cup; recipe is easily
doubled.

VVegetables steeped in hot milk add flavor to this versatile sauce,
which can replace the butter-flour-milk white sauce in any of your
recipes. It also forms the base of a salt-free cheese sauce that in
its turn can dress vegetables, open-fac sandwiches, macaroni or baked
potatoes.
