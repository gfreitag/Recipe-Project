Select fresh tender beets and cut off the tops and roots. Wash the
beets, without removing the skins, and boil in a large pot with ample
water.  Meanwhile, clean the beet greens with the stems; add to the
pot after the beets have cooked 30 min.  When beets are tender,
remove and strain the liquid.  Peel the beets and cut them into round
slices; chop up the greens. Mound greens in center of a platter and
surround them with the beet slices.  Pour oil and vinegar over all,
and serve. or serve with Skordalia (garlic) Sauce. Serve hot or cold.

SKORDALIA SAUCE:  Clean garlic and mash it completely (you may use
food processor).  Mash in potatoes, one by one, until you have a
thick paste (the more potatoes you use, the more sauce you get--but
less potent). Alternately add the oil and vinegar, beating
constantly. If the sauce is too thick for your taste, add a little
water or fish or chicken stock. NO LUMPS IN THIS SAUCE, P-L-E-A-S-E !!

NOTE:  Many people like to add almonds or walnuts to skordalia.
These are mashed to a pulp and added to the paste before the
potatoes, oil, and vinegar.
