Title: BASIC FOCCACIA
Categories: New, Text, Import
Basic Dough:
Yield: 4 Servings  :
1 1/2 c  warm water -- (110 to 115
degrees)
:
1 TB sugar
1 pk yeast 3 1 /4 c all-purpose flour
2 ts salt
Topping:
:
2 TB olive oil
1    Roma tomato, -- sliced
thinly
:
2 TB chiffonade of basil
1/4 c  grated Parmesan cheese

In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in the warm water. Sprinkle the
yeast over that mixture and

let stand for 10 minutes, to bloom (it should begin to foam). In the
mixer bowl with the dough hook attached, add 3 cups of flour, salt
and yeast mixture. Slowly turn it on and work the dough together.
Turn it up to medium and mix for 5 minutes. If the dough is sticky,
continue mixing and gradually add the remaining flour. Place this
smooth ball of dough into an oiled bowl, cover and set aside to rise
for 3 hours.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Punch down the dough, and remove it
from the bowl onto a lightly oiled, 9-inch by 13-inch sheet tray.
Spread the dough out onto the sheet tray. Using your fingertips, make
"dimples" in the dough. Drizzle the dough with olive oil, sprinkle on
the basil, spread out the tomato slices, sprinkle on the cheese and
bake for 30 - 35 minutes.

Yield: 6 appetizers
