Title: BARLEY MUFFINS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 Big muffin
2 1/2 c  Barley flour
2 ts Baking powder
ds Salt
2    Eggs
1/4 c  Rich cream
1/4 c  Honey
Sift together the barley flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat eggs
slightly.  Combine eggs, cream, and honey with dry ingredients and mix
well.  Pour batter into muffin tin and bake at 400 F for 25 minutes
The same book says barley flour can be substituted for white flour
and make an all-barley bread.  So it seems one could substitute oats
for some of the barley in this recipe to make Barley/oats muffins.
