Title: BARBEQUED PORTOBELLO MUSHROOMS
Categories: Digest, August

When I get invited to a bar-b-q, my favorite things to bring are
portobello mushrooms and corn on the cob. They're easy to deal with.
Marinate the portobellos in balsamic vinegar for an hour beforehand
and then throw 'em on the grill like burgers.  I remove the stem and
cut slits on the cap. In a group of non-vegetarians, the sight of 5"
diam. mushrooms on the grill is a conversation-starter.
