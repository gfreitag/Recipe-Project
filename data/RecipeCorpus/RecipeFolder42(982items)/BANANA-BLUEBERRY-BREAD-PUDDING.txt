Here's a variation on bread pudding from the Noble House B&B,
Bridgton, ME.  Crumble the banana bread into small pieces or grate it
if it is stale. Place in bowl with milk and beaten eggs, ( use 3 or 4
eggs) mixing well. Oil a 1 1/2 to 2 quart baking dish and pour in
mixture. Dot with 1 Tablespoon butter, broken into bits. Sprinkle on
granola and top with blueberries over entire surface.  Bake at 350~
about 45 minutes or until pudding sets.  Serve warm or cold with
yogurt, applesauce, or as is.
