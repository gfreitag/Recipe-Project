Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
6 c  Water
2 ts Salt
2 lb Boneless lamb, cut into
Serving chunks
3    Cloves garlic, crushed
1 c  Barley
2 tb Olive oil
1>. Place the water, salt, lamb and garlic in a 4-quart heavy, covered
saucepan. Bring to a boil, turn to a simmer, cover and cook for 2
hours. 2>. Remove all from the pot, reserving the broth. Remove the
fat from the broth and add enough water to make six cups. 3>. Place

meat and broth to the pan and bring to a light boil. 5>. Simmer,
covered, for 25 minutes or until the barley is soft and tasty and the
liquid is absorbed. 6>. Serve with crusty Italian bread or with pita
bread.
