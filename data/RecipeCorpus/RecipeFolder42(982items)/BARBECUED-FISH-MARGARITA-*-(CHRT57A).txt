Place fish in a non-aluminum dish large enough to hold it in a single
layer. Combine tequila, triple sec, lime juice, salt, garlic, and 2t
oil and pour over the fish, rubbing all over. Cover and marinate for
1/2 hour at room temperature or up to 3 hours in the refrigerator,
turning occasionally. Just before serving, combine tomatoes, onions,
chilies, cilantro, sugar and salt to taste. Heat the grill to VERY
hot. Remove fish from marinade, pat dry (reserving marinade) and
brush lightly with 1 t oil and grind pepper over the surface. Cook on
a greased grill for about 4 minutes per side, or until flesh is
opaque. Meanwhile, boil marinade in a saucepan for 2 minutes, remove
and discard garlic cloves, and spoon a little over the fish. Spoon
the tomato salsa along side and serve.
