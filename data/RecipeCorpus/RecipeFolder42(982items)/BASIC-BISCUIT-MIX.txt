8 c  Martha White Self-Rising --
Flour --  sifted
1 c  Shortening
Cut shortening into flour with pastry blender or two knives until
mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Store in a tightly covered container
at room temperature. Mix will keep up to 4 months. To prepare
biscuits, preheat oven to 450. Lightly grease a baking sheet. Add 1/3
cup milk to 1 cup Basic Biscuit Mix for 5 to 6 biscuits (double for
more biscuits). Stir with a fork only until dough leaves sides of
bowl. Turn dough out onto lightly floured board or pastry cloth;
knead gently just until smooth. Roll out to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut
into rounds with floured 2-inch cutter. Place on prepared baking
sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Makes 5 to 6
biscuits per 1 cup mix. NOTE: If using Martha White All-Purpose
Flour, sift 1/4 cup baking powder and 1 tablespoon salt with flour.
