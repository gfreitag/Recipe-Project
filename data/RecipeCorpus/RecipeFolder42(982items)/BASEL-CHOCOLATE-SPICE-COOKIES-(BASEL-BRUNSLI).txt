Title: BASEL CHOCOLATE-SPICE COOKIES (BASEL BRUNSLI)
Categories: Cookies, Swedish
Yield: 2 Servings
1 1/4 c  Blanched whole almonds
-(about 7 ounces)
1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
3 1/2 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
2 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/8 ts Ground cloves
3 oz Bitterswet (not unsweetened)
-or swmisweet
Chocolate, chopped fairly
-fine
1/4 ts (generous) almond extract
2 lg Egg whites
2    To 5 Tbl confectioners'
-sugar for rolling out
-cookies
Heat oven to 325F.  Line several baking sheets with aluminum foil.

In a food processor, process the almonds and 1 cup powdered sugar
until the almonds are powder-fine but not oily; stop the processor
and scrape down the sides several times. Add the cocoa powder,
cinnamon, cloves, and chocolate; continue processing until the
chocolate is finely ground. Add the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar,
the almond extract, and egg whites; process until the mixture is
blended and just forms a mass. Set the dough aside for 5 to 10
minutes to stiffen slightly.

Generously dust a work surface with powdered sugar. If the dough
seems too soft to roll out easily, dust it with more sugar and knead
until the consistency is manageable, but avoid adding any more sugar
than absolutely necessary.  Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness,
lifting it with a spatula frequently and redusting the surface and
rolling pin with powdered sugar to prevent sticking.  Cut out the
cookies using a 2 1/4-inch heart-shaped (or similar) cutter.  Use a
spatula to transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheets, about
1 inch apart.

Bake the cookies for 9 to 12 minutes or until almost firm on top and
slightly puffy.  Let them stand on the foil lined baking sheets until
completely cooled. Peel from the foil. Store airtight for 3 to 4 days.
Freeze, airtight, for longer storage.

Makes about forty 2 1/4-inch cookies.
