Title: BASIC RED CHILE SAUCE
Categories: Condiments, Mexican, Sauces
Yield: 4 Cups
8 ea Dried red chiles*
4 c  Water
2 tb Flour
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 lg Garlic cloves, chopped
1 pn Dried oregano
1 ts Cider vinegar
*For a spicy sauce, use 1 New Mexico and 7 California chiles.
Eliminate the New Mexico chile for a milder sauce. Wearing gloves,
use a small knife to remove chile stems and seeds, then wash the
chiles well. Place in a saucepan with the water and bring to a boil
over high heat; boil for 5 minutes, then allow to sit for 10 to 15
minutes. Whirl the water and chiles in a food processor or blender,
in batches if necessary, for 20 to 30 seconds, or until the skins are
finely chopped. Pass through a strainer, pressing the chile pieces
through with a wooden spoon. In a medium skillet, make a roux by
combining the flour and oil. Saute over low heat for 2 minutes, then
add the garlic, chile mixture, oregano and vinegar. Stir well and
simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. The sauce will keep in the refrigerator,
tightly covered, for about 5 days, or it can be frozen for 2 to 3
months.
