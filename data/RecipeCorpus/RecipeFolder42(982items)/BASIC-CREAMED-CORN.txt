Melt butter, stir in flour. Add milk slowly, stirring with whisk until
completely blended, thickened and gently bubbling. Add kernels and
simmer about 3 minutes. Season with salt and white pepper.

Leftover Creamed Corn; pureed in blender or food processor, makes a
quick sauce for shrimp, scallops or crab. Mix cooked seafood into
corn sauce, simmer gently and spoon over a toasted English muffin.

Although any variety of fresh corn will do, white, thin-skinned
kernels make a superb creamed vegetable dish.
