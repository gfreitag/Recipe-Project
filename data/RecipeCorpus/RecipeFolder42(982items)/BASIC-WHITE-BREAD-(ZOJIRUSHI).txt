Title: BASIC WHITE BREAD (ZOJIRUSHI)
Categories: Breads4, Brdmachine
Yield: 1 Loaf
1 1/2 c  Water
2 tb Oil
3 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
2 tb Powdered milk
4 3/4 c  Bread flour
3 ts Yeast*
*I use 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of the yeast from Sam's.

Combine all ingredients in pan.  Set timer for Quick Baking (2 hours)
and light crust. Makes a 2 pound size loaf.

NOTE: This is a basic white bread that you can use as a base for other
flavored breads.  This bread has a nice firm yet light texture. I add
basil or Italian seasoning and/or garlic powder for an Italian
flavored bread that's great with spaghetti. I sometimes substitute
1/4 cup oatmeal for 1/4 cup of flour for the added nutrients.
