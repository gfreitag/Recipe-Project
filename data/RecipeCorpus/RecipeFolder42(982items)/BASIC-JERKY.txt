Title: BASIC JERKY
Categories: Dehydrating, Preserving, Meats
Yield: 1 Recipe
1 1/2 lb Lean boneless meat
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1 ts Worcestershire
1/2 ts Onion powder
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 ts Garlic powder
1/4 ts Liquid smoke
Vegetable oil cooking spray
Freeze meat until firm but not hard; then cut into 1/8 to
1/4-inch-thick slices.

In a medium-size glass, stoneware, plastic or stainless steel bowl,
combine soy sauce, Worcestershire, onion powder, pepper, garlic
powder, and liquid smoke.  Stir to dissolve seasonings.  Add meat and
mix until all surfaces are thoroughly coated. Cover tightly and
refrigerate for at least 6 hours or until next day, stirring
occasionally; recover tightly after stirring.

Drying the jerky:  Depending upon the drying method you're using,
evenly coat dehydrator racks or metal racks with cooking spray; if
oven drying, place racks over rimmed baking pans.

Lift meat form bowl, shaking off any excess liquid. Arrange meat
strips close together, but not overlapping, on racks.

Dehydrator drying:  Arrange trays according to manufacturer's
directions and dry at 140-degrees until a piece of jerky cracks, but
does not break, when bent (8 to 10 hours; let jerky cool for 5
minutes before testing).

Pat off any beads of oil from jerky.  Let jerky cool completely on
racks; remove from racks, place in a rigid freezer container, and
freeze for 72 hour.  Then store in airtight, insectproof containers
in a cool, dry place; or freeze or refrigerate.  Makes about 3/4
pound.

Storage time:  Up to 3 weeks at room temperature; up to 4 months in
refrigerator, up to 8 months in freezer.
