and discard stems; then, chop into very small pieces.

Shell, devein and wash prawns.  Chop into very small pieces

Peel and crush water chestnuts with the flat side of the cleaver. If
you don't have a cleaver, chop the water chestnuts into very fine
pieces.

Add all other ingredients and mix well.  1 teaspoon of filling is
used for each wonton.

With one corner of the skin toward you, place 1 teaspoon of filling
about an inch from the corner.

Fold one corner to cover the filling.

Told once more...about 3/4 inch.

Turn the won ton so that the triangel is toward you. Dampen the left
corner with a little water.

Swing the right corner away from you and place it on top of the
dampened left corner.  As you make this fold, simultaneously pull the
filling toward you with your middle finger. You should finish with a
little "hat-like" effect.
