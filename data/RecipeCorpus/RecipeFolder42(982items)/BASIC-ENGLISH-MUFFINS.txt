Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Servings
MMMMM--------------------YEAST-FLOUR MIXTURE-------------------------
2 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Sugar
2 ts Salt
1    Envelope active dry yeast
MMMMM-----------------------LIQUID MIXTURE----------------------------
1 3/4 c  Milk
1/4 c  Water
1 tb Butter
MMMMM---------------------REMAINING INGREDS--------------------------
1    Egg
4 c  All purpose flour, divided
1/2 c  Cornmeal
Yeast-flour Mixture: In large bowl of mixer stir together 2 c flour,
the sugar, salt and dry yeast; set aside.

Liquid Mixture: Heat milk, water and butter until very warm (120 to
130 degrees F).  Add gradually to yeast-flour mixture and beat at
medium speed 2 minutes. Add egg and 1 c flour; beat at high speed 2
minutes. Stir in just enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.
Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, adding
more remaining flour if dough is sticky.  Cover with plastic wrap and
let rise in warm, draft-free place until double, about one hour.
Punch down. Cover and let rise again until double, about 45 minutes.
Punch down.  On lightly floured surface roll out 1/2 inch thick. With
a 3 1/4 inch round cutter cut out muffins. Sprinkle cookie sheets
lightly with cornmeal. Add muffins, about 1 inch apart. Sprinkle with
additional cornmeal.  Cover; let rise until double, about 45 minutes.
Heat lightly greased griddle or heavy skillet. With wide spatula
carefully remove muffins (do not compress or puncture or they will
collapse) to griddle.  Bake over very low heat 8 to 10 minutes on
each side until light brown. (Muffins should sound hollow when
tapped) Cool on racks. To serve, split with fork tines; toast.

VARIATIONS - ONION: Add 1 envelope onion soup mix and 3 T nonfat dry
milk to yeast-flour mixture and decrease salt to 1 t. Increase butter
to 2 T. Substitute 1 3/4 c water for the milk in liquid mixture
(total 2 c water).
