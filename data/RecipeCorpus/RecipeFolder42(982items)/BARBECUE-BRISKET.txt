Title: BARBECUE BRISKET
Categories: Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Brisket
Adolph's Meat Tenderizer
Garlic salt
Liquid Barbecue Smoke¨
Worcestershire sauce
Prepared barbeque sauce
Pierce brisket all over with meat fork.  Sprinkle Adolph's meat
tenderizer on both sides of meat. Let stand one hour at room
temperature. Sprinkle on garlic salt. Place meat inbaking dish or zip
lock bag. Pour 2-4 oz. liquid smoke over meat (depending on how big
brisket is). Cover and refrigerate overnight. Turn over in the
morning. Five to eight hours before serving add 5 tablespoons
Worchestershire sauce. Cook covered in a 225¡ oven. The last hour of
cooking, pour about (9 oz) one half bottle of barbecue sauce (Kraft
original or your favorite kind) over meat. If desired the sauce can
be thickened with a little cornstarch-water paste. Slice thin and
serve. The meat will not burn, but it will become tender and fall
apart the longer it cooks. Enjoy the smell while it's cooking and the
compliments when you serve it!
