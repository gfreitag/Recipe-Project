Fat grams    per serving:
:40 Bring water to a boil in a large heavy pot. Add salt and reduce
heat until water is simmering. Take cornmeal by the handful and add
to water very slowly, controlling the flow to a thin stream through
your fingers. To avoid lumps, stir quickly with a long handled wooden
spoon while adding cornmeal.  If necessary, stop adding cornmeal from
time to time and beat mixture vigorously.  Cook, stirring constantly,
20 to 30 minutes. Polenta will become very thick while cooking. It is
done when it comes away cleanly from the sides of the pot.  Pour
polenta into a large wooden board or a large platter. Wet your hands
and smooth out polenta evenly, about 2 inches thick.  Let cool 5 to
10 minutes or until polenta solidifies. Cut cooled polenta into
slices 1 inch wide and 6 inches long. Place slices in individual
dishes. Serve hot, covered with your favorite sauce. Makes 6 to 8
servings. Variation: Fried Polenta (Polenta Fritta): Prepare polenta
and let cool completely.  Cut cooled polenta into slices 2 inches
wide and 6 inches long. Pour oil about 1 inch deep in a large
skillet. Heat oil until a 1-inch cube of bread turns golden almost
immediately. Fry polenta slices on both sides until light golden.
Drain on paper towels. Serve hot. It is importent to insure the oil
is hot enough, otherwise the polenta will absorb oil and your polenta
will be greasy and unpalatable.
