Title: BARBECUED LIMA BEANS (USDA)
Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
2 lb Dry lima beans -- small
3 qt Boiling water
8 oz Salt pork -- finely diced
1/4 c  Instant minced onion
3 tb Prepared mustard
2 ts Worcestershire sauce
2 ts Chili powder
1/8 ts Garlic powder
2 cn Tomato soup, condensed --
(10 1/2-oz each)
1/4 c  Vinegar
1 1/3 tb Brown sugar
2 c  Bean cooking liquid
Line four 8x8-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap. Allow
enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six servings
or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be served
without freezing.

Add beans to boiling water; return to boiling.  Boil beans 2 minutes;
then soak beans 1 hour (or overnight, if preferred).

Cook beans slowly until tender, about 45 minutes. Drain; save 2 cups
cooking liquid.  Brown salt pork with onion. Mix remaining
ingredients with salt pork mixture. Add beans; stir gently. Pour
one-fourth of mixture into each baking pan.  Spread mixture to avoid
air pockets.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Bake 30
minutes.

TO FREEZE:  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Complete
wrapping by pulling paper up over top of food. Put edges of wrap
together and fold several times so paper lies directly on top of
food. Fold ends of freezer wrap over the top and seal with freezer
tape. Label with name of food, date of freezing, and last date the
food should be used for best eating quality (about 6 months).  Freeze
immediately for 10 to 12 hours before removing packages from the pans.

TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD:  Preheat oven to 400B0 F. (hot). Remove freezer
wrap. Place food in baking pan.  Bake 1 hour or until center is hot.
