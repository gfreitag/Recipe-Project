seasoning on the inside curl of the lettuce leaves. Set aside.

4. Grill the steak for 1 to 3 minutes for rare, medium, or well done,
according to taste, over charcoal or in a gas or electric broiler.
Take 1 lettuce leaf, put several slices of steak in the center, add
about 1 tablespoon of the seasoned scallions, a sliver or two of
garlic, fold the lettuce over the steak and eat. Make as many
sandwiches as you can eat.

Serve with rice and side dishes or as a glorified appetizer with
drinks.
