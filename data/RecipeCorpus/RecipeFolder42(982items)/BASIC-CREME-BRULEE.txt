Title: BASIC CREME BRULEE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Whipping Cream
5    Egg Yolks
1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb Vanilla Extract
1/2 c  Light Brown Sugar -- firmly
Packed
Combine the first 4 ingredients, stirring with a wire whisk until
sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth. Carefully pour the egg mixture
evenly into 5 (5x1) round baking dishes or custard cups. Place in a
roasting pan large enough to accomodate the dishes and add 1/2-inch
of water to the roasting pan. This step creates a water bath to
prevent curdling. Bake at 275 for 45 to 50 minutes or until almost
set. Cool the custards in the water in the pan set on a wire rack.
Remove from pan when cooled, cover and refrigerate overnight. When
ready to serve, sprinkle about 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar evenly
over each custard; place each custard on a cookie sheet or jelly-roll
pan. Broil 5 inches from heat. If using an electric oven, leave door
partially open. Broil until the sugar melts. Let stand 5 minutes to
allow sugar to harden.

NOTES:

Handle with care. These are extremely hot. Place custards as close to
heat source as possible. To achieve a "cracked" effect, broil
custards in a pan full of ice. Dixie Crystals sugar is reputedly the
best for making this dessert. ***When finished cooking, the center
will still be slightly liquid.
