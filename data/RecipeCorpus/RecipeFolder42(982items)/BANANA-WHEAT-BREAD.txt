This is the recipe I have used for my Hitachi bread machine. We
really like it. You could use all white flour instead of wheat if you
like. I add the walnuts at the beginning with other ingred. It seems
to mix better. You can also add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon if you like. We
like it better without. Sandy in Arroyo Grande, CA 8:49am PST FROM:
