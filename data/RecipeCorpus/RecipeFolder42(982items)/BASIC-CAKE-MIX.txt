Title: BASIC CAKE MIX
Categories: Misc
Yield: 60 Ounces
3 c  Flour; sifted
2 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Baking powder
1 c  Butter
1/2 c  Vegetable shortening
Sift flour, sugar, and baking powder together.  Cut in butter and
shortening with a pastry blender or two knives. You can also use your
food processor for this step.

Store mix in a covered container in the refrigerator and use within
the month.

Note: Store mix in the refrigerator rather than on the pantry shelf
because it contains butter.  It will still be as convenient as a
packaged mix, however, as the recipe for Quick Pound Cake shows.
