Title: BASIL SMOKED SHRIMP & SCALLOP KEBABS
Categories: Fish, Herbs
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Applewood chips
1/2 lb Large shrimp (about 12),
Peeled and deveined
1/2 lb Sea scallops (about 12)
1 c  Chopped fresh basil (leaves
And stems)
Soak the applewood chips in water for 1 hour.

Soak four 6-inch amboo skewers in water for 15 minutes. Thread the
shrimp and scallops alternately onto each skewer.

Line a wok or a straight0sided fry pan with a double thickness of
aluminum foil.  Drain the applewood chips and combine them with the
basil in the bottom.  Insert a low rack that wil keep the skewers
raised, but still allow a cover to fit.

Place the skewers across the rack and cover the pan. If using a wok,
ring 2 wet towels around the cover; for a fry pan, drape a wet towel
over the cover and secure tightly.

Smoke the kebabs for 15 minutes over medium-high heat. Remove the pan
from the heat and set it aside for 5 minutes before uncovering. Serve
immediately.
