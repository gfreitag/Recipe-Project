Title: BASIC STOCK
Categories: Soups
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 lb Chicken pieces
1 1/2 lb Pork spareribs
15 c  Water
3    (to 4) pieces fresh ginger,
Unpeeled and crushed
3    (to 4) scallions, each tied
Into a knot
3 tb (to 4T) Chinese rice wine or
Dry sherry
Trim off any excess fat from the chicken and spareribs. With a sharp
knife, chop them into large pieces.

Place the chicken and spareribs in a large pot or pan with the water.
Add the ginger and scallion knots.

Bring to a boil and, using a strainer, skim off the froth. Reduce the
heat and simmer, uncovered, for 2-3 hours.

Strain the stock, discarding the chicken, pork, ginger, and
scallions; add the wine or sherry and return to a boil. Simmer for
2-3 minutes. Refrigerate the stock when cool. It will keep for up to
4-5 days. Alternatively, it can be frozen in small containers and
defrosted when required.
