Title: BASTILLE DAY GRILLED LAMB WITH ROSEMARY
Categories: Lamb
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lg Clove garlic, minced
1 tb Fresh rosemary, minced
1 tb Olive oil
2 ts White wine vinegar
2 ts Dijon mustard
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 lb Leg of lamb*
Freshly ground black pepper
*Brought to room temperature. A butterflied leg of lamb has a center
portion and two flaps. This recipe uses only the center portion. The
remaining portions can be stored in the freezer for later use. The
larger flap (sirloin) can be grilled. The smaller one is excellent to
use for kebabs. If you're cooking for a larger group, use the entire
leg.

1. Prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire. Or heat oven to 450 degrees
and line jellyroll pan with aluminum foil.

2. Combine garlic, rosemary, oil, vinegar, mustard and salt in a small
bowl. Rub over entire surface of lamb. (Can be done as long as 12
hours ahead of time, if desired.)

3. Place lamb on grill or baking sheet and sprinkle generously with
ground pepper. Grill or bake until it registers 120 degrees on an
instant reading thermometer for rare, 22 to 25 minutes; or longer as
desired. Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
