Title: BASIC SWEET DOUGH
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Very warm water (105 F to
-115F)
2 pk Active dry yeast
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/3 c  Instant nonfat dry milk (in
-dry form)
2 lg Eggs, at room temperature
1/2 c  Lightly salted butter or
-margarine, at room
Temperature
1 ts Salt
5 c  All-purpose flour (up to 5
-1/4 cups)
Combine the water, yeast, and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Let stand
for 2 minutes.

Add the dry milk, eggs, butter, salt, and 2 1/2 cups of the flour. Mix
until smooth, then beat for 2 minutes. Stir in enough of the remaining
flour to make a soft dough.

Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface (using some of the
remaining flour) and knead for 6 to 8 minutes until smooth and
elastic, adding only as much flour as needed to prevent the dough
from sticking.

Place the dough in a greased bowl; turn once to bring the greased
side up. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled
in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.

Punch down the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Use
this Basic Sweet Dough to make:

Cinnamon Twist Scandinavian Almond Ring Honey Almond Twist

A delicate, not-too-sweet dough that lends itself admirably to
toppings and fillings made of fruits, nuts, and spices. It can be
shaped into twists, rolls, rings, and braids.  Each of the
accompanying recipes calls for half a recipe of the dough.  Double
the filling if you wish to make two coffecakes, or make two different
coffeecakes from one batch of dough. Either way, you can freeze one
to use later.
