1    Yeast; dry; envelope
1 c  Water; warm (105-115~)
5 1/2 c  All purpose flour
1/4 c  Olive oil
4 ts Basil; crumbled dried
1/4 ts Sage; crumbled dried
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1 3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper; freshly ground
1/2 c  Water; warm (105-115~)
(Makes 2 baguettes.) Sprinkle yeast over 1 cup water in bowl of
heavy-duty electric mixer; stir to dissolve. Let stand 5 minutes.
Thoroughly mix in 1 1/2 cups flour. Sprinkle 1/2 cup flour over
dough. Cover with towel. Let rise in warm draft-free area until
doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Heat oil in heavy small skillet over low
heat. Add basil and sage and stir until aromatic, about 1 minute.
Cool. Blend 1 cup flour, oil mixture, wine, salt and pepper into
dough, using dough hook. Slowly add remaining 1/2 cup water. Stir in
2 1/2 cups flour 1/2 cup at a time. Knead dough in mixer until smooth
and resilient, about 10 minutes, adding more all purpose flour if
sticky. Grease large bowl. Add dough, turning to coat entire surface.
Cover bowl. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled,
about 1 1/4 hours. Grease two baking sheets. Punch dough down. Divide
in half. Form each piece into 14-inch-long loaf. Place on prepared
sheets, seam side down. Let rise in warm draft-free area until almost
doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400~. Slash tops of loaves
with sharp knife. Bake until breads sound hollow when tapped on
bottom, about 50 minutes. Cool on wire racks before serving.
