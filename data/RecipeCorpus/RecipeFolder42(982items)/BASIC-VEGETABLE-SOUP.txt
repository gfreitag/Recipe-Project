Categories: Vegetables, Soups, Healthwise
Yield: 6 Servings
3 c  Beef broth -- *see note
2 c  Water
1 c  Tomato juice
2    Potatoes -- medium size
3    Carrots -- diced
1 sm Onion -- diced
2    Celery stalks -- diced
1/4 c  Green peppers -- diced
1/2 c  Green beans -- chopped
1/2 c  Lima beans
1/2 c  Corn
4 tb Margarine -- solid
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Salt -- or to taste
* Use about 6 cups liquid. You may mix chicken and beef broth (canned
lowfat, not bouillon cubes) with water and tomato juice or vegetable
juice cocktail to suit your tastes.

1. Melt 4 tablespoons margarine in skillet. Add the chopped green
peppers, carrots, celery and onion. Saute on low heat until
vegetables are softened and onion browned lightly. Add this to the
broth mixture which has been placed in a large, heavy pan with lid.

2. Add to this the potatoes, green beans, lima beans and corn. Cover
and simmer for about 45 minutes or until all the vegetables are done.
Add the salt and pepper.

3. Remove about 2 cups of the mixture and put into blender. Puree this
mixture and return to pot with rest of soup. Turn off heat and cover
soup. Best if allowed to set for up to 1 hour to blend flavors. Since
this is a basic recipe for soup, you can add the vegetables you
prefer and follow the directions above to finish the soup. Some
suggestions: Add bay leaf, shredded cabbage, chopped zucchini, diced
turnips, fresh tomatoes, okra or parsley. For added nutrition, serve
with a sprinkling of lowfat cheese on the hot soup. Also good
sprinkled with toasted croutons. This stores very well in
refrigerator and is actually improved with time.
