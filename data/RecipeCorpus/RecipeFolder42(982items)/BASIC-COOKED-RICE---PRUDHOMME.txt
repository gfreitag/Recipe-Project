In a 5x9x2-1/2-inch loaf pan, combine all ingredients; mix well. Seal
pan snuggly with aluminum foil.  Bake at 350F until rice is tender,
about 1 hour, 10 minutes. Serve immediately. However, you can count
on the rice staying hot for 45 minutes and warm for 2 hours. To
reheat leftover rice, either use a double boiler or warm the rice in
a skillet with unsalted butter. From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana
