Title: BASIC SALAD DRESSING 2
Categories: Low-cal, Salads
Yield: 8 Servings
2 tb Red wine vinegar
2 tb Acceptable vegetable oil
4 tb Water
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/8 ts Garlic powder
1/8 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Fresh lemon juice
In  jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine all ingredients. Shake well
and refrigerate.  Makes 1/2 cup. (Half of published recipe.) My note:
I frequently use bottled lemon juice which has sodium listed, but
there can't be much sodium in 1/2 tsp. divided among 8 servings. If
you use fresh lemon juice, extra can be frozen in an ice cube tray or
small container.
