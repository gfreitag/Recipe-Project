Title: BASIC BALTI SAUCE
Categories: Indian, Sauces, Balti
Yield: 4 Servings
3 tb Vegetable oil
4    Onions, chopped
Small piece of ginger,
Peeled and grated
1    Large garlic clove, crushed
1    Tomato, chopped
1 tb Paprika
1/2 ts Turmeric
1/2 ts Cumin (ground)
1/2 ts Ground coriander
1 ts Chili powder
Fresh chopped coriander
(a handful)
Salt to taste
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over moderate heat. Fry the onions,
ginger and garlic until the onions are translucent. Add the tomato
and stir-fry, breaking it up with the spoon. Pour in 300 ml / 1/2 UK
pint water, and stir in the other ingredients.  Bring to the boil.
Lower heat, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and
allow to cool. Pour into a blender or food processor and liquidize.

(Note:  this is only one formula of thousands possible. There's no
more a single recipe for Balti sauce than there's a single recipe for
chili. Some cooks like more garlic, some more chili powder;  some use
fresh chilies as well:  some add yogurt, coconut, cream...you name
it.)
