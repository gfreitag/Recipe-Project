The term "3/down" refers to the weight of the ribs. In this case, it
is three pounds or less for each slab of 10 to 12 ribs.

Combine salt, sugar, cumin, pepper, chili powder and paprika to make
barbeque rub.  Rub ribs thoroughly with this mixture. Place ribs on
baking sheets and cook in 180 degree oven for 3 hours. Do not turn;
solow cooking infuses spices.

Remove from oven.  (ribs may now be covered and refrigerated up to 2
days before grilling)

Use very low charcoal fire with rack set as high as possible. Grill
ribs 5 minutes to 30 minutes per side, depending on heat and
temperature of ribs. Ribs should have light outer crust and be heated
throughout.

If you prefer juicy ribs, coat with basting sauce just before
removing from grill.  Otherwise serve dry with sauce on side. Remove
ribs from grill, cut in between bones and serve.

Note:  Recipe is easily halved or doubled.  Keep 2:1 proportion of
sauce to rub.
