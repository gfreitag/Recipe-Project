1. Combine the egg white and sugar in a mixing glass, and stir with a
bar spoon to dissolve the sugar. Add the cachaca, lemon juice and ice
cubes. Place a bar shaker on top of the mixing glass and, grasping
the glass and shaker firmly together with both hands, shake them
vigorously 9 or 10 times. Remove the shaker, place a strainer on top
of the glass and pour into a chilled old-fashioned glass. With a
sharp knife, slit the lemon slice from the peel just to the center,
and use the slit to hold the slice on the rim of the glass.
