Title: BANDA KOPIR TARKARI (VEGETABLES STIR FRIED WI
Categories: Side dish, India, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 ts Turmeric
1/2 lb Potatoes, cubed
1    Onion, finely chopped
1    Bay leaf
1/2 ts Cumin, ground
1/2 ts Ginger, ground
1/4 ts Chili powder
4    Tomatoes, chopped
1 c  Cabbage, finely sliced
1/2 c  Peas
Oil
Salt
Start by heating the oil in a heavy pan and put in the tumeric and
some salt. Fry for a few seconds and then add the cubed potatoes,
turning frequently so that they turn yellow from the tumeric. Cook
them for 5-10 minutes (they will complete their cooking later) and
remove them from the oil and set aside. Adding more oil if necessary,
now saute the onion slices until they are soft and transparent. Then
add the bay leaf, cumin, ginger and chili powder. Stir well and put
in the tomatoes. When they have begun to break down, add the cabbage
bit by bit, stirring it in well so that it is sauteed in the spices.
Cover and cook gently for 3-5 minutes. Finally put in the peas and
semi-fried potatoes and seasoning.Mix well, replace the cover and
continue to cook for 5-10 minutes or until potatoes are ready.
