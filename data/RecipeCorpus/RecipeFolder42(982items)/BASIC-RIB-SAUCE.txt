Title: BASIC RIB SAUCE
Categories: Bbq sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Ketchup
1/2 c  Brown sugar
3/4 c  Water
4 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/2 ea Onion diced
1 tb Onion soup mix
1 tb Maple syrup
Combine all ingredients.  Simmer for 15-30 minutes until sauce is
correct thickness.  Place par-boiled ribs on grill. Baste and smear
with sauce. Turn and baste periodically. I leave ribs on a low grill
for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  You may decide to use a water pan for moisture.
