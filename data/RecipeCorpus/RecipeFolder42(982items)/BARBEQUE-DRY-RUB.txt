Title: BARBEQUE DRY RUB
Categories: Rubs
Yield: 1 Servings
4 tb Cumin
4 tb Thyme
4 tb Garlic powder
4 tb Black Pepper, freshly ground
2 tb Cayenne Pepper
2 tb Salt
2 tb Curry Powder
1 tb Onion Powder
1 tb MSG or other flavor enhancer
-(optional)
In a small bowl or glass jar with a lid, combine all the ingredients.
Stri or shake to mix.  Use immediately or store in a cool, dark place
for several months.

This rub is pretty strong and so I do not recomment it for thin cuts
(like ribs).  Bit it is swell on heavier cuts of meat such as beef
round, prime rib, pork shoulders, and even the whole hog. With this
recipes, you have enough for five shoulders or four hams. Best if you
let the meat marinate, losely covered, in the refrigerator for a good
twenth-four to forty-eight hours after being rubbed.
