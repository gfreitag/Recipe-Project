2 tb Light soy sauce

CUT THE PIECE OF PORK BUTT in half. Cut the two halves into 3/4-inch
strips. Put the strips in a bowl with the marinade and mix well to
coat them thoroughly. Marinate at room temperature for 3 hours, or
overnight in the refrigerator. Remove the pork from the marinade and
baste the strips with the malt-sugar mixture. Use curved skewers
(available in Chinese cookware shops and some restaurant- supply
stores) to hang the meat from the top shelf of the oven over a large
pan filled with water to a depth of 1/4 inch. Roast the pork at 350F
for 45 minutes, basting occasionally with the malt sugar or honey.
Increase the heat to 425F and roast for 20 minutes to finish the
pork. When the pork is cool enough to handle, cut it into 1/2-inch
slices. Arrange the pork slices on a platter. Serves 4 to 6 as a main
course accompanied by vegetables, 8 to 10 as an appetizer.
