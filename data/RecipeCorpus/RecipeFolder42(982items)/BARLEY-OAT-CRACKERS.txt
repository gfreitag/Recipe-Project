Title: BARLEY-OAT CRACKERS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 70 Servings
1 1/2 c  Rolled oats (oatmeal)
1 1/2 c  Barley flour (if
Unavailable, use all-
Purpose flour)
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Baking soda
1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
1 tb Honey
1/2 c  Warm water
"Barley flour gives these crackers lightness, and the oats provide a
sweet, nutty flavor. For those cracker-lovers who are allergic to
wheat, oats and barley are a blessing. Try these crackers with a
glass of cold, freshly squeezed orange juice for a quick and
nutritious breakfast. 350~F. 15 to 20 minutes Preheat the oven to
350~F.

Grind the oats in a blender or food processor to a fairly fine
consistency (about 25 pulses with the food processor). In a large
bowl or in the food processor, mix the oats with the flour, salt, and
baking soda. Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse
meal.

In a small bowl, dissolve the honey in the warm water and slowly
blend this sweetened water into the flour mixture until the dough
will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/8 inch. Cut out 2-inch crackers
with a cookie cutter, juice can, or knife and arrange on a lightly
greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.

With the tines of a fork, prick each cracker 2 or 3 times. Bake for 10
minutes. Turn the crackers over and bake another 5 to 10 minutes, or
until very lightly browned. The flavor of these crackers is best if
they are not allowed to become more than pale brown.

Cool the crackers on a rack. Yield: 60-70.
