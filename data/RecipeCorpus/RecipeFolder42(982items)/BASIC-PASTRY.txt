Categories: Pastry, Desserts, Pie
Yield: 2 Servings
5 c  All-purpose flour
1 lb (500g) cold shortening
1    Egg
1 tb White vinegar
Ice Water
1.  Measure flour and place in a large bowl.  Cut cold shortening
into 1" cubes and add to flour.  Using a pastry blender or 2 knives,
cut shortening into flour until it is the consistency of coarse meal.
Make a well in centre.

2.  Place egg and vinegar in a measuring cup.  Add ice water to bring
it up to 1 cup.  Whisk to break up egg and blend with water. Add
liquid to flour mixture all at once. Then, using a fork, work until
all dry ingredients are moist.  Using your hands, gather dough into a
firm ball. Do not over- mix or knead dough. Cut dough into 4 equal
pieces.

3.  Wrap each piece of dough individually and refrigerate until well
chilled, at least 30 minutes but preferably overnight. Well-wrapped
pastry will keep well inthe refrigerator for a least a week or in the
freezer for several months.
