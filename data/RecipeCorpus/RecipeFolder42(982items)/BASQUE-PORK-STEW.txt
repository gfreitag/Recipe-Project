Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Lean pork shoulder
3 tb Olive oil
Salt
Pepper
2    Onions, thickly sliced
1 c  Chicken stock
2 tb Tomato paste
2    Sweet red peppers, in strips
1/4 lb Prosciutto or ham,
-coarsely chopped
10    Garlic cloves, thin sliced
1 ts Paprika
1 ts Dried thyme
1/4 ts Hot pepper flakes

Cut pork into 1-1/2-inch cubes. In deep skillet or shallow saucepan,
heat 1 tb of the oil over medium-high heat; brown pork in batches,
adding more oil as necessary. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Transfer
to plate.

[Tip: Brown meat in batches. Adding too much meat to the skillet at
one time will cause meat to steam, not brown nicely.]

Add onions to skillet; cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally,
for 5 minutes. Add stock and tomato paste; bring to boil, deglazing
pan. Return pork to skillet; stir in red peppers, prosciutto, garlic,
paprika, thyme and hot pepper flakes.

Grate rind from orange; add to stew. Peel orange; chop coarsely and
stir into stew. Reduce heat; cover and simmer over low heat, stirring
occasionally, for 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until pork in tender. Taste and
adjust seasoning.

[Can be prepared up to 2 days ahead, covered and refrigerated. May be
frozen for up to 2 months, thaw in refrigerator and bring to room
temperature. Reheat over medium-low heat.]
