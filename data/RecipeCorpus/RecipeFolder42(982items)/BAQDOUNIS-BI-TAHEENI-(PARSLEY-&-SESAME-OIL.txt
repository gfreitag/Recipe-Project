This parsley sauce is not as well known as hummus bi taheeni but it is
equally flavorful and makes an excellent meat or bland fish
accompaniment.

Crush garlic with salt and work into a smooth paste with a little
lemon jui ce. Mix taheeni with the garlic and slowly add lemon juice
with the water u ntil a smooth sauce like thick cream is formed. Add
parsley and more salt a nd lemon juice enough to give it a tart
flavor. Serve cold.

Makes about two and a half cups of sauce.

To make this sauce quickly in the electric blender, add lemon juice
and water alternately in small amounts to the taheeni. Add garlic
crushed with salt. Blend in parsley at low speed last. Parsley should
be recognizable so do not overblend the sauce at the end.
