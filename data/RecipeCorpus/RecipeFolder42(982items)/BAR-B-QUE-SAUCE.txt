Title: BAR-B-QUE SAUCE
Categories: Sauces, Seasonings
Yield: 8 Servings
1 ts Oil
1    Garlic clove
3 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 ts Mustard
1/2 c  Water,cold
1/2    Onion
3 tb Vinegar
2 tb Molasses
1 c  Catsup
1 ts Cornstarch
1. Heat oil in pan. Dice onion, add to pan. Brown onions over high
heat, add garlic, if desired. Stir as needed, so the onion doesn't
burn. When onion turns clear, add the following and quickly stir in
vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, molasses and mustard. When these have
mulled together, stir in catsup and cold water with cornstarch
stirred in.
2. Simmer sauce over low heat, for at least ten minutes. Take care it
doesn't burn. More water can be added, to thin, or to make more
sauce. The corn starch will thicken the sauce as it simmers.
3. This sauce can be used as a marinade for beef, pork or chicken.
Remove meat from sauce to BBQ, or bake in sauce in oven at 350'F.
Usually marinade enough chicken for 6-8 people in half of this recipe
and freeze the other half of the sauce, for another time.
