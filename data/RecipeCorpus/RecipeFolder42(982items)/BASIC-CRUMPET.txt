Title: BASIC CRUMPET
Categories: British, Breads
Yield: 8 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
OR 1 cake compressed yeast
1/4 c  Water*
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
3 tb Butter or margarine
1 c  Milk, scalded
1    Egg
3 c  All purpose flour
*Use very warm water (105-115 degrees for dry yeast, lukewarm (80-90
degree) for compressed yeast.

Sprinkle dry yeast or crumble cake yeast into water.  Let stand for a
few minutes; then stir until dissolved.  Add sugar, salt, and butter
to warm milk, stirring to dissolve; cool to lukewarm.  Add egg, yeast
mixture and flour and beat thoroughly.  Let batter rise in warm place
for 30 minutes; with spoon beat for 3 minutes.

Repeat rising and beating and then rising again.

Pour batter into greased 4 inch muffin rings on medium hot greased
griddle (325 degrees on electric griddle) filling rings one third
full.

Bake until well risen and browned on one side.  Turn over, rings and
all, and brown on other side (should take about 18 to 20 minutes)

Remove, cool, split, and toast.

Although crumpets are similar to English muffin, crumpets are softer
in texture with surface holes appearing during the pan cooking; these
holes enable the crumpet to absorb great quantities of butter.
