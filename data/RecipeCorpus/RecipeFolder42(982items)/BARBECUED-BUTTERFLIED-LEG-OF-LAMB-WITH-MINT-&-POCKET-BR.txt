Title: BARBECUED BUTTERFLIED LEG OF LAMB WITH MINT & POCKET BR
Categories: Meats, Lamb, Holiday
Yield: 9 Servings
1    Leg of lamb (5-6 lb)*
3/4 c  Balsamic vinegar
1/3 c  Mint jelly
1/3 c  Minced fresh mint leaves
Fresh mint sprigs (opt)
Salt
Pepper
Small pocket bread**
* - boned and trimmed of surface fat

** - or regular pocket bread, cut in half crosswise

1. Lay meat boned side up. Slash about halfway through thickest
portions, as needed, and pull meat, patting cut edges down, to make
the piece relatively even.

2. Place lamb in a 9x13" pan. In a 1 1/2 quart pan over medium-high
heat, stir vinegar with 1/3 cup mint jelly just until boiling. Stir
in mint and pour evenly over lamb. Cover and chill 2 hours or up to a
day. Turn meat over occasionally.

3. On firegrate in a barbecue, with a lid, ignite 50-60 charcoal
briquets. When briquets are dotted with ash, in about 30 minutes,
spread them into a single layer; scatter 10-12 more briquets over
coals. Set grill 5-6" above coals. Lift meat onto grill; reserve
marinade. Put lid on barbecue and open vents.

4.Turn meat as needed to brown evenly; baste with marinade. Cook until
thickest part of meat is done to your liking; for rare (140' on a
thermometer) in center of thickest part, allow about 40 minutes total.
Thinner sections will be well done.

5. Transfer lamb to a platter and let rest 5-10 minutes. Garnish with
mint sprigs. Slice meat thin. Season to taste with mint jelly, salt,
and pepper. Eat with knife and fork or tuck into pocket bread.
