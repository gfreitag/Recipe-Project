Title: FLAGEOLETS WITH PESTO
Categories: Main dish, Salad
Yield: 2 Servings
400 g  Canned flageolets
2 tb Pesto sauce (see recipe)
-Or a little more
75 g  Small button mushrooms
-- finely sliced
This is a fantastic salad, prepared in no time at all, and at very
little cost. Serve it with warm nan bread and one or two other
interesting salads.

Drain the flageolets and reserve a little of the liquid. Mix the
pesto with 1 tbs of the liquid, adding more if necessary to bring to
a mayonnaise consistency. Dress the flageolets in the pesto mixture,
and fold in the mushrooms. Mix well. Leave to stand at room
temperature for an hour or two before serving. Heap on to soft
lettuce leaves lightly dressed with vinaigrette and serve.
