Title: FOCACCIA (ITALIAN FLATBREAD)
Categories: Breads, Italian, Ethnic
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/2 c  Flour, bread
1 tb Dried rosemary leaves
2 ts Salt
1/2 tb Yeast
3 tb Oil, olive
1 c  Water; hot
Oil, olive
Mix 1 1/2 cups of the flour, the rosemary, salt, and yeast in a large
bowl thoroughly. Add 3 tablespoons oil and the hot water. Beat on low
speed 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly. Beat on medium speed 1
minute, scraping bowl frequently.  Stir in enough remaining flour to
make dough easy to handle. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface.
Knead 5 to 8 minutes or until smooth and elastic.  Place in greased
bowl; turn greased side up. Cover and let rise in warm place about 1
hour or until double. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when
touched.) Punch down dough. Brush 12-inch pizza pan or large cookie
sheet with oil. Press dough in pizza pan or flatten into 12" circle
on cookie sheet. Make depressions, with fingers about 2 inches apart,
into dough.  Brush with oil; sprinkle with pepper. Let rise uncovered
in warm place
30    minutes.

Heat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until golden
brown. Brush with additional oil.  Serve warm.

*If using quick-acting yeast, omit first rise.  After kneading, cover
dough and let rest 10 minutes.  Press dough in pan and continue as
directed.

High altitude directions (3500 to 6500 feet): Rising times may be
slightly shorter.
