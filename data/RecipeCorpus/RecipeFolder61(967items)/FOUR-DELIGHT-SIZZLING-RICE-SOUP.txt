This soup makes a showy presentation.  At the table you slide fried
rice cakes into the soup to create a crackling, sizzling sound.
Actually, you can add the rice cakes to almost any soup and give the
soup a sizzling name.  The trick is to be sure that both rice cakes
and soup are piping hot.
In a bowl, blend soy, sherry and cornstarch.  Add prok and mix until
well coated.  Let stand for ten minutes. In a 2-quart pan, heat
chicken broth to boiling.  Add pork, stir several times, then reduce
heat and simmer for five minutes.  Add mushrooms, water chestnuts,
and peas. Simmer, uncovered, for 2 minutes. Add green onion, salt to
taste and sesame oil.
Keep soup hot while you fry sizzling rice cakes per recipe. Pour hot
soup into a warm tureen and carry to the table. Bring hot fried rice
cakes to the table in a bowl and immediately slide into the soup.
