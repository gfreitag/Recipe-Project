This Southwestern-style dish from the Cervena venison people packs an
intense flavor punch.

To make the avacado cream, place all ingredients in a processor or
blender and blend until smooth.

Combine all the meat spices in a large bowl. Place the venison in the
bowl and mix to coat well. Brush off excess coating and let stand 1
hour.

Heat the barbecue grill; oil the grill.

Brown venison well over high heat, turning often and basting lightly
with olive oil. When done to your taste, remove from grill, cover
with foil and let stand about 5 minutes; serve with coriander cream.
