Rinse the fish, pat dry and cut into pieces to fit comfortably inside
each pepper. Combine minced garlic and salt in a medium bowl and mash
to a paste with the back of a spoon.

Add the lemon juice, coriander, pepper and 1 tablespoon olive oil and
stir to combine. Bruise 3 or 4 of the basil leaves and add them to
the marinade. Add the fish pieces, toss gently to coat evenly, and
marinate for 1 to 2 hours.

Cook the pasta until just done, drain, and rinse with cold water.

Warm the peppers (loosely covered to prevent drying) and serving
plates in a low oven.

Heat 2 skillets over medium-high heat, 1 for the fish (nonstick if
possible) and 1 for the sauce. Remove the fish from its marinade and
add it to the dry skillet.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to the other skillet, add
the sliced garlic and cook until it begins to color. Immediately add
the tomatoes and pasta and toss to coat evenly. Add the basil leaves,
remove from the heat, and season to taste.

Spread the contents evenly on the plates and lay the peppers on top.
As the fish pieces are done, tuck them inside the the peppers.
Drizzle or brush the tops of the peppers with the extra-virgin oil
and serve.

Serves 4.
