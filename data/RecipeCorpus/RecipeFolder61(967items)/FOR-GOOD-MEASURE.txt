Categories: Info
Yield: 1 Info
No ingredients
Measure ingredients such as baking powder, baking soda and salt in
standard measuring spoons. (Do not use kitchen flatware as measuring
equipment.)

Measure butter or margarine by sticks if indicated in the recipe or
use the indicated markings on wrapper. If necessary, pack into nested
measuring cup and level with knife.

Measure brown sugar by packing into nested measuring cup. Level
surface with knife. When removed from cup, the brown sugar should
remain in the shape of the cup.

Measure flour and other dry ingredients in lightly spooning into
nested measuring cups. Level with a straight-edged spatula or knife.

Measure liquids in a regular liquid measuring cup; read amounts at eye
level.

When adding dry ingredients alternately with liquid, begin and end
with dry ingredients. Beat just until smooth after each addition;
over mixing will reduce volume.
