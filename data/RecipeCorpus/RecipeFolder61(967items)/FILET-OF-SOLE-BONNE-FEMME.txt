-chopped
1 lb Mushrooms; chopped
3 lb Sole Filets
1 1/2 c  Dry White Wine
1 tb Lemon Juice

1 ts Salt
1/4 ts White Pepper
1 1/2 tb Flour
1 c  Heavy Cream
Grease a 12" skillet with 2 tb butter or margarine; sprinkle with
shallots or green onions; add mushrooms. Fold filets in half or
thirds; place in pan. Add wine and water to just cover filets. Add
lemon juice, parsley, salt and pepper. Cover with a circle of wax
paper with a small hole cut in the center. Bring to a boil. Reduce
heat; simmer 3 minutes. Remove filets to a serving plate; keep warm.

Blend flour and 1 tb butter or margarine (beurre manie.) Reduce
liquid in skillet by half. Add beurre manie, a small amount at a
time, stirring until sauce is smooth. Add cream; bring to a boil;
correct seasoning. Remove from heat. Add remaining butter or
margarine a little at a time, rotating skillet to effect a gradual
melting. Pour over filets. Glaze quickly under the broiler or in a
425Ã¸F oven. (The purpose of the glazing is to improve the appearance
of the dish, and could be omitted without changing the taste in any
way.)
