Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Light brown sugar, packed
1 c  Warm water (105F-to-115F)
3 c  Bread flour
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour

STIR YEAST AND SUGAR into warm water; let stand until foamy, about 5
minutes. Put both flours, salt and oil into food processor work bowl
fitted with metal blade. Turn processor on to combine mixture. With
processor running, slowly add yeast mixture. Mix until dough cleans
sides of bowl. If dough is too sticky, add more flour by the
tablespoon, working it in before adding more. If dough is too dry and
crumbly, add more water by the teaspoon, working it in before adding
more. Once desired consistency is reached, process dough until well
kneaded, uniformly supple and elastic, about 40 seconds. Add walnut
pieces and process for 10 seconds. Remove blade. Then remove dough
from bowl and press all loose walnuts into it. Transfer dough to
large plastic bag, squeeze out air and seal at top. Place dough in
bowl. Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Oil baking
sheet. Punch dough down and shape into smooth ball. Place round side
up on baking sheet. Cover loosely with oiled plastic. Let rise in
warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. 15 minutes before baking,
preheat oven to 400F, with rack in center of oven. When loaf has
doubled, slash loaf for surface design. Lightly brush with glaze.
Bake until loaf is deeply browned and sounds hollow when rapped on
the bottom, about 35 minutes. Immediately remove from pan to cool on
rack.

NOTE: (To toast nuts, spread single layer on jelly roll pan and bake
in 350F oven until fragrant and toasted, 8-to-10 minutes, watching
carefully to avoid burning) Makes 1 Loaf
