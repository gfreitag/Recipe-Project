Title: FIG ICE CREAM
Categories: Ice cream, Fruits, Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Very ripe figs
3 tb Water
1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
1/2 c  Sugar; plus:
1 tb Sugar
3    Egg yolks
Vanilla; to taste
Cognac or brandy (optional)
-- to taste
Wash the figs, cut off the stem ends, and cut in quarters into a
non-corroding saucepan.  Add the water and cook slowly until very
tender, about 20 minutes, stirring often. The cooking time will
depend on the variety of fig you are using and how thick the skin is.
Coarsely chop the figs in a food processor, or put them through a
food mill, or crush well with a potato masher. Warm 1 cup of the
cream with the sugar in a non-corroding saucepan, stirring
occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved.  Whisk the egg yolks
just enough to mix them and whisk in some of the hot cream mixture to
warm them. Return to the pan and cook over low heat, stirring
constantly, until the custard coats the spoon. Strain through a
medium-fine strainer into a container. Add the remaining cream and
1-1/2 cups of the fig puree.  Flavor to taste with a few drops each
of vanilla and Cognac or brandy. Chill thoroughly. Freeze according
to the instructions with your ice-cream maker.
