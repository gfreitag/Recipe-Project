Prepare the fettucine.  Clean any soil clinging to the morel stems.
Place the mushrooms in a spice mill and grind to a fine powder.
Combine the powder with the semolina and all-purpose flours in a food
processor and process briefly to blend.  Beat the eggs, egg yolks and
oil together and, with the motor running, add the mixture to the
flours. Process until a neat ball forms on top of the blade, about 45
to 60 seconds. Remove the dough from the machine and knead for a
minute on a very lightly floured surface. Pat into a thick cylinder
and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

About 1 hour before serving time, cut the dough across into 6 pieces.
Knead, stretch, and cut each piece in a pasta machine or by hand.
Spread the fettucine on a tray dusted with semolina. Cover with a
towel until cooking time.

Prepare the sauce.  Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover for 5
minutes.  (Halve and rinse fresh morels.) Drain the mushrooms, halve
them lengthwise and rinse briefly. Cut into small pieces. Heat the
butter in a skillet and add the morels and shallots. Cook over low
heat until the shallots are tender.  Add the cream and simmer,
stirring often, until the sauce is lightly thickened, about 15
minutes. Season with salt, white pepper and nutmeg to taste.  The
sauce can be prepared and gently reheated just before serving.

Rub any fuzz from the fiddlehead ferns and trim the tails to leave
about 1/2 inch.  Drop them into boiling salted water and cook until
tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well. At serving time, heat them
through in the butter.

About 20 minutes before serving time, sprinkle the pheasant breasts
lightly with salt and white pepper and let them sit at room
temperature until you are ready to cook. Heat the butter in a large,
heavy skillet. When it foams, add the breasts and brown lightly for
about 5 minutes. Turn and cook over moderately low heat until they
are nicely browned and barely done in the center, about 5 more
minutes. Remove them and let them sit for 5 minutes.

Drop the noodles into a large quantity of boiling salted water.
Return to a boil, stirring.  Cook about 1 minute, just until tender.
Drain them thoroughly and toss with three-quarters of the sauce.

Arrange the fettucine on 4 serving plates.  Slice each pheasant
breast in 6 vertical slices and fan over the pasta. Top with the
remaining sauce and surround with the fiddlehead ferns.
