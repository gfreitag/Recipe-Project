Title: FOCCACCIA
Categories: Italian, Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Pizza dough
Olive oil
Seasonings
Let the dough rise for about 4 hours until double in size. Punch down
and roll out to fit a shallow paking pan or pizza pan. The dough
should be about 1 inch thick. Spread olive oil thinly on top. Salt
and top with a season of you choice. I love Rosemary. You can also
add sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, onions, or any other herbs. Bake at
375 for 25-30 min or until golden. Cut into squares and serve.
