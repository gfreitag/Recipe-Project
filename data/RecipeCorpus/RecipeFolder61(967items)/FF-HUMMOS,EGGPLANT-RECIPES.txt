Title: FF HUMMOS/EGGPLANT RECIPES
Categories: Digest, Jan.
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Garbanzo beans
x  Eggplant
x  Lemon (1 juiced)
x  Garlic (6 cloves)
For fatfree hummos, I soak and cook garbanzo beans, 1/2 to 1 pound
depending on what you want.  I bake one whole eggplant in the oven
until the skin is black and the flesh is soft.

Cool and peel the eggplant, blend in the food processor or blender
with the garbanzo beans, adding the juice of one lemon, a couple or
six cloves of garlic and salt to taste.  Blend it all up until
smooth. Yuuummy.
