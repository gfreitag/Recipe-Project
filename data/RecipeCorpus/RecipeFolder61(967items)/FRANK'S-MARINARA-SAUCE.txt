Title: FRANK'S MARINARA SAUCE
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
4 tb Extra virgin olive oil
6    Garlic cloves, baked and
Pureed
2 cn Italian peeled tomatoes
(303 size)
1 cn Tomato paste (6 oz size)
1 sm Onion, finely chopped
6 ea Anchovy fillets
2 ts Sweet basil
1/2 ts Oregano
1 ea Lemon peel strip
2 ts Black pepper
To bake garlic, first, cut the tops off the garlic heads and place
them into a shallow baking pan with the cut sides up. (I normally
bake several heads at once, they don't last long around here!) Then
pour olive oil over the garlic, cover the pan with aluminum foil, and
bake at 400 degrees for 1 hour. When the heads are cooked (they will
become soft and mellow), set them aside and let them cool to room
temperature.
Puree 6 cloves of garlic and the anchovies together. In a 5-quart
Dutch oven, heat the olive oil and gently blend in the pureed garlic
until smooth. Then add both the peeled tomatoes and the tomato paste,
along with the onions, and cook over medium heat until the mixture
begins to reduce and thicken.
Now, add the sweet basil, oregano, and lemon peel and stir
everything together well. Then cover the pot, reduce the heat to low,
and simmer for about 45 minutes.
At this point, add the black pepper and season the sauce with salt
to taste (it may not need any, depending upon the saltiness of the
anchovies). Then cover and simmer for another 15 minutes.
