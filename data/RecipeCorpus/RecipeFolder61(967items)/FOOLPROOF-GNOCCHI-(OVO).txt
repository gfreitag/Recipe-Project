Title: FOOLPROOF GNOCCHI (OVO)
Categories: Digest, Dec.
Yield: 1 Servings
1    5-oz  box instant potato
Buds
2 c  Boiling water
1    Egg's worth egg replacer (or
Two egg whites -- necessary
For binding)
2 c  Flour (whole wheat works
Fine)
Mix the potato buds and water together like mashed potatoes. Cool.
Add egg replacer and flour. Knead lightly on floured board. Take a
small protion at a time and roll on flloured board into strips about
1 inch thick. Cut small pieces about 1 inch long. Roll each piece
over a fork, making an impression with your thumb, to give the pieces
the classic gnocchi shape. Be sure to keep the dough floured well, or
it will become sticky. Place the peices on a floured cookie sheet,
making sure they don't touch. Drop the pieces into boiling water.
After they reach the surface (which may be almost immediately), cook
them _gently_ (don't boil them!) for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and serve
with the sauce of your choice.

I'd be interested to hear any experiences you might have with the
recipe.
