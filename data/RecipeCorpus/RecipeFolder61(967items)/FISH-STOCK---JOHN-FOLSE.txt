Ask your seafood supplier to reserve two pounds of white fish bones
and heads or two pounds of whole inexpensive white fish for this
stock. Combine all ingredients in a two gallon stock pot. Bring to a
rolling boil, reduce to simmer and cook for forty-five minutes.
During the cooking process, skim off all impurities that rise to the
surface. Add water if necessary to retain volume. Strain through fine
cheese cloth or strainer. Return stock to low boil and reduce to two
quarts.
