BEULAH RD, PITTSBURGH WINE: BORGOGNO BAROLO 1. Preheat oven to 375F.
2. Horizontally slice each filet butterfly-style-leave one edge in-
tact so filet is not completely cut through. Season with salt,pepper
and garlic. 3. In cen- ter of each filet place 2 slices prosciutto,
one slice mozzarella and several slices of truffle or mushrooms. 4.
Close halves of each filet like a sandwich. Press meat together
around edges to seal. 5. Beat parsley and grated cheese into eggs. 6.
Dip meat into milk, then into bread crumbs and finally into eggs.  7.
Heat butter and oil in saute pan until bubbling hot. Add filets and
cook over low heat until nicely browned on both sides. 8. Drain off
cooking fat. Add lemon juice,wine and chicken stock to skillet and
place in pre- heated oven for approx. 10 minutes-less time is
required for rare,

longer for well-done. 9. Pour a little pan juice over each filet, then
garnish with sprigs of watercress or en- dive.
