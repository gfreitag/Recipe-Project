~=> Menu Red Caviar Canapes Strawberry Surprises Fondue Bourguignonne
Meat Dip Sauces: Mock Bernaise, Anchovy, Garlic, Mustard Plum Elite
Espresso coffee (no recipe) Light California champagne (no recipe)

~=> Serving Suggestion Starched blue linen, crystal serving dishes,
white porcelain and sterling champagne glasses all bring a touch of
elegance to an intimate deck-side gathering. Arched candelabra with
tall white tapes would be perfect for illuminating the fondue dish.
Each guest could be handed a porcelain salad size plate with blue
linen napkin folded on top and frosted sliver champagne glass.
Remember to preheat your best demitasse cups for the expresso.

~=> Red Caviar Canapes chopped chives

Mix onion juice, lemon juice and cream cheese.  Using a pastry tube,
form a crown of this mixture on rounds of toast. From the jar of
caviar, take a dab to fill each center. Decorate the edges with
chopped chives.

~=> Strawberry Surprises  (note:  NO LIE!!!) 2 lbs fresh strawberries
1 cup powdered sugar 1 cup light rum 1 cup vodka 1 cup Triple Sec

Gouge out the stems so the hollow center of the strawberries are
exposed. Place them in a plastic container and sprinkle the powdered
sugar over them. Add the rum, vodka and Triple Sec and gently tumble
until well mixed. Refrigerate covered for at least 2 days
occasionally tumbling. Gently remove strawberries from marinade and
serve cold in pre-chilled crystal bowl.  Sip the marinade!!!

~=> Fondue Bourguignonne 1 1/2 lbs beef tenderloin (cheaper cuts may
need to be tenderized) peanut oil

Cut meat into bite-sized pieces and set aside.  Pour oil into your
fondue dish or chafing dish until it is at least 3 inches deep. Heat
the oil t about 360~ or until it will cokk a test chunk of meat in
three minutes. Each guest spears a chunk of beef with a fondue fork
and cooks it to taste in the hot oil. (It's nice to mark the forks
with a colored dot on a piece of tape so they will be recognized).
After the pieces of meat are cooked, each guest dips the choice
morsel into one of the variety of elegant sauces.
