Using sharp knife or cleaver, trim lamb of fat and gristle and remove
any tendons. Separate muscles of meat and remove any filmy skin. Cut
meat across grain into thin slices about 1/6" wide and 1 1/2" long.
Place slices in bowl. Add soy sauce, wine, sugar, ginger root and
cornstarch and toss lightly to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and
marinate 30 minutes in refrigerator. Prepare sauce and set aside.
Heat wok or skillet. Add 1/4 cup corn oil and heat to about 400'F.
Add lamb slices and stir-fry over high heat, stirring continuously,
until meat loses red color and separates. Remove with slotted spoon
and drain in colander. Clean out skillet. Reheat skillet, add 1
tablespoon corn oil and 1 tablespoon sesame oil. Heat until very hot.
Add garlic and leeks and stir-fry over high heat about 1 1/2 minutes,
until leeks are just tender. Add cooked lamb and stir-fry sauce and
toss lightly to coat. Transfer to serving platter.
