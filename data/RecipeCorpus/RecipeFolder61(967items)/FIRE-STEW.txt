Title: FIRE STEW
Categories: Spices/etc., Soups/stews
Yield: 12 Servings
2 1/2 lb Sugar-cured ham
6 oz Dr. Schnitzel's hot sauce
4 oz Scotch Bonnet pepper sauce
1 lb Lentils
1 lb Kidney Beans
4 oz Tabasco Sauce
Water
Put the ham, lentils and beans in enough water to cover. Cook until
beans are done.  Put in all hot sauces. Cook several more hours,
until the flavor is all through the ham, which is thoroughly broken
apart.

Serve with something cold to drink.  It's great for your sinuses.
I just threw this together because I was feeling reckless, but the
taste was wonderful, and the stuff freezes well, too. Both Dr.
Schnitzel's and the Scotch Bonnet pepper sauce are habaÂ¤ero sauces,
which I think accounts for the wonderful flavor (as well as the
heat.) Tabasco alone would work, if you used a *lot*, but the flavor
wouldn't be as good, I think.

Happy sweating!
