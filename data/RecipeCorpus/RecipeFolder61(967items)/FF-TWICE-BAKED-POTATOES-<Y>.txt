Title: FF TWICE BAKED POTATOES <Y>
Categories: Digest, Oct., Lacto
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Baking Potatoes
x  Nonfat Plain Yogurt
x  Seasonings
x  Molly McButter
They are also good twice baked.  After they have baked the first time,
slice the top off (this makes a delicious potato skin treat), scoop
out the insides, mash or beat with a mixer til smooth. (If you eat
dairy, a little nonfat plain yogurt mixed in gives it a nice tang.)
Add any other seasonings and/or Molly McButter, if desired, when
mashing. Put potato back in the shells. Sprinkle with paprika and
bake until completely heated through, approximately 20-30 minutes, at
425 degrees.
