Without a doubt, this is England's most famous dish. Always deep
fried, the fish is mostly cod, and the batter made with eggs, milk
and flour.Liberally salted, the fish and chips are traditionally
doused with malt vinegar and wrapped in newspaper, so that everything
goes limp. My recipe is designed not to flaunt tradition, but to make
the taste available to those who count fat grams for good reason. My
method delivers this "grease heaven" for a mere 13 grams of fat per
serving...or 23 percents calories from fat. The peas are definitely
not "classic" -t hey simply don't behave well in a newspaper...but
then who does?

Helpful Hints BIG CHIPS. The bigger the better! We experimented for
some time with the idea that the larger the french fry the lower its
fat content would be. It's simply a matter of exposed surface area.
By cutting a large russet potato lengthwise into three slices both
ways, you'll get nine potato sticks between 1/2" and 3/4". When they
are cooked, you'll experience a completely new and fabulous taste -
potato, almost free of grease. DIRECTIONS: THE CHIPS: Preheat the
oven to 500F. In a large frying pan, heat the oil and fry the potato
sticks until brown on all sides - about 13 minutes. Transfer the
potatoes to a roaster pan and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven
and sprinkle with the salt. THE FISH: In a small bowl, combine the
cornmeal, bread crumbs, cayenne, salt, parsley and dill. Spread the
mixture out on a large plate. Pour the milk, flour and oil out, each
onto its own large plate. Set all 4 plates side by side.
Dip the fillets first into the milk and then into the flour, turning
until completely covered. Next dip the fish back into the milk, then
into the bread crumb mixture and through the oil. Place the breaded
cod on a baking sheet and bake for 8 minutes (you can time the fish
to cook for the last 8 minutes with the chips.) THE PEAS: In a medium
saucepan, bring the water to a boil and simmer the peas, salt, mint
and sugar until the peas are tender - about 3 minutes. TO SERVE:
Divide the fish and chips among 4 dinner plates. I serve this classic
with a "handy" wedge of lemon (easy to squeeze), peas and watercress.
It's the combination of golden browns and vivid greens and lemon
yellow that makes such a great picture.
