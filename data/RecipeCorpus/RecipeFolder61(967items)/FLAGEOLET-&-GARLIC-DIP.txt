Title: FLAGEOLET & GARLIC DIP
Categories: Dips/spread, Appetizers, Vegan
Yield: 2 Servings
175 g  Canned flageolets
2 ts Ground cumin
2 ts Coriander
2 ts Turmeric
1 lg Garlic clove; crushed
1/2    Lemon; juiced
3 tb Olive oil
-or slightly more
Salt
The soft green colour of flageolets is highlighted by turmeric, and
the rest of the spicing gives this dip a vaguely oriental feeling. It
is rich, nourishing food best served with crudits and bread-sticks
or pitta bread.

Put the flageolets, spices, garlic and lemon juice into the blender
and whizz to a thick pure with some of the juices from the can.
Gradually stir the oil into the mixture to thin out to a dipping
consistency. Season to taste.
