Title: FLORENTINE ONION SOUP - CARBACCIA
Categories: Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Olive oil
4 lb Yellow onions, cut in half
-lengthwise thinly sliced
2 ts Sugar
Salt
750 ml White wine
4 c  Chicken broth
1    Cinnamon stick
4 c  Stale Italian or French
-bread, torn
Parmesan cheese, grated
In a Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium high heat. Add the onions
and toss to coat with the oil. Cover tightly, reduce the heat to
medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are
soft an just beginning to color (30 minutes).

Remove the cover, increase the heat to medium, and cook, stirring
occasionally, until the onions are amber (45 minutes). Sprinkle with
sugar and a little salt. Cook, stirring frequently until the sugar
melts and the onions are caramelized (5 more minutes). Add the wine,
broth, and cinnamon stick. Stir well, and bring to boil. Cover
tightly, reduce heat to low and simmer gently for one hour, stirring
occasionally.

Add the bread to the simmering soup and continue cooking until the
bread disintegrates, 30 to 45 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent
the soup from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Discard the cinnamon
stick. Using a wire whisk, whip the soup until the bread is well
incorporated. Taste and add more salt if needed. Garnish with
Parmesan. From the cafe creosote web page.
