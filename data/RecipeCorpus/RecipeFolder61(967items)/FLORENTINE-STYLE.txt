I did some research on Florentine, and decided there is no one recipe
to follow, so I`ll give you my version. The florentine part of tne
recipe is basically a bed of spinach. The meat is varied, such as
fried fish, veal cutlets, sliced steak. pork cutlets, chicken
cutlets. Use your imagination.

Wash and cook the spinach in a small amount of water. Drain well
(squeeze with hands when cool enough), chop coarsely. In a large pan
melt butter in olive oil and when hot add spinach and fry lightly.
Season with salt, pepper, + nutmeg. Sprinkle in the flour, add the
warm milk and stir. Simmer for a few minutes. Transfer to a baking
dish and keep warm in oven. Prepare meat or fish. When ready top the
spinach with the meat and serve hot.
