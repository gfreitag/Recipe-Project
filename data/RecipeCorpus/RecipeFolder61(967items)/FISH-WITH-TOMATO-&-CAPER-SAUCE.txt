The sauce is the important element in this Maltese dish. It can be
served with fish cooked plainly in any manner++grilled, fried,
poached, baked or barbecued.

Chop 1 large onion and 4 cloves of garlic.  Fry gently in a
tablespoon of oil until golden.  Add 1/2 kg of peeled and chopped
ripe tomatoes (or use a 400 g tin), 1 tablespoon tomato paste, 1/2
teaspoon sugar, juice of 1/2 lemon and salt and pepper to taste.
Simmer for 15 minutes then add 3 tablespoons of capers, the zest of
1/2 lemon and 2 tablespoons chopped mint.  Cook until the sauce is
thick and serve with 4 portions of cooked fish.

Makes 4 servings.
