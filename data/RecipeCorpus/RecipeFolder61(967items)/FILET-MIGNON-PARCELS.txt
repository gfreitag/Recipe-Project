Preheat oven to 400 degrees Season Filet Mignons with salt and pepper
and sear quickly in 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon olive
oil. Cool. Melt 6 tablespoons butter and remaining olive oil in a
skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and saute, stirring, until
they release their liquid. Add Madeira and chives and cook over
mediumlow heat until soft. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Cool. Melt remaining butter. Cut phyllo sheets into thirty six 8 1/2-
inch squares. To make parcels: Place one phyllo square on flat
surface, brush with butter, place another square on top of first with
corners turned 45 degrees. Continue in this way, turning each square
before placing on top of the other so the corners do not lay on top
of one another. Each parcel should contain 6 sheets of phyllo. Keep
phyllo covered as you're working so it doesn't dry out. Spoon 2
tablespoons of mushrooms into center of each packet. Place tenderloin
on top of mushrooms. Top tenderloin with another 2 tablespoons of
mushrooms. Gather edges of phyllo together and gently twist. Tie with
a leek ribbon. Transfer to parchmentlined baking sheet, brush lightly
with melted butter and bake approximately 20 minutes, or until beef
