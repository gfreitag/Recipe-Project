Cut beef into 1/2-inch slices; cut slices into 2-inch strips. (For
ease in cutting, partially freeze beef about 1-1/2 hours.) Cut bacon
into 1/4-inch pieces; fry in Dutch oven until crisp. Remove bacon
with slotted spoon; drain on paper towels.  Pour off fat and reserve.
Cook and stir onions and garlic in 2 tablespoons of the reserved
bacon fat until tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove onions.  Cook and
stir beef in remaining bacon fat until brown, about 15 minutes. Stir
in flour to coat beef; gradually stir in water. Add onions; beer, bay
leaf, brown sugar, salt, thyme, and pepper. Add just enough water to
cover beef if necessary. Heat to boiling; reduce heat.  Cover and
simmer until beef is tender, 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Remove bay leaf. Stir
in vinegar; sprinkle with bacon and parsley. Serve with noodles.
