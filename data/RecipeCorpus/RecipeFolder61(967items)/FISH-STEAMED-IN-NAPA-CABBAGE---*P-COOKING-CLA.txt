~----------FOR THE FISH:-------------- BRING A POT OF WATER to a
boil, and blanch the cabbage leaves until pliable, about 2 minutes.
Drain and set aside. Cut the salmon and sole into 1/2-inch cubes, and
set aside. Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the
shallots and garlic, and saute, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes.
Add to the fish, along with the lemon juice, pepper, salt, thyme and
basil. Place 2 cabbage leaves overlapping slightly. Divide mixture in
the center of the six sets of leaves. Roll cabbage, tucking in the
sides to enclose the filling, and secure the rolls with toothpicks.
Place in a bamboo steamer, and steam over boiling water for 7 to 10
minutes. While the rolls are steaming, puree the stock, peppers,
lemon juice, anchovy paste and pepper in a blender or food processor
with a steel blade. Pour into a small saucepan, and bring to a boil
over medium heat. Reduce by half, stirring frequently. To serve,
place a pool of sauce on the plate, and top with a cabbage roll.
Note: The cabbage rolls can be refrigerated for a day before cooking,
tightly covered with plastic wrap. Do not steam until just prior to
serving. The sauce can also be prepared a day in advance, and
refrigerated. Reheat over a low flame, stirring occasionally.
