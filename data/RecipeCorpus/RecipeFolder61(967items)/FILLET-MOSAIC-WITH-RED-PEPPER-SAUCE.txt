Categories: Fish, Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Thin sole fillets
1/2 lb Thin salmon fillets
12    Lge spinach leaves; rinsed
2 c  Fish or chicken stock
1    Shallot; minced
1/2 c  Dry white wine
2    Large red peppers *
1 tb Apple jelly

*Note: Red bell peppers should be roasted, peeled and pureed. Cut
sole into 24 (1/2-inch-wide) strips, about 5 inches long. Cut salmon
fillets into 12 (1/2-inch-wide) strips 5 inches long. Trim stems from
spinach leaves. Blanch spinach in hot water about 3 seconds to
soften. Drain. Roll lengthwise as thinly as possible. To prepare each
serving, place 6 sole strips lengthwise side by side. Tightly weave a
spinach strip among sole strips at top. Below weave salmon strip. Now
weave in another spinach strip. Continue to alternately weave salmon
and spinach strips. You will need 3 salmon strips and 3 spinach
strips for each sole mosaic. Continue to weave remaining 3 portions.
Set aside. Place stock and shallot in skillet large enough to hold
fish squares. Bring to boil, then reduce heat. Using wide slotted
spatula, lower fish squares into hot broth. Cover and simmer over
very low heat 5 minutes. Carefully remove. Keep warm. If your skillet
is not large enough to hold all of fish, cook them in batches. Skim
any white residue from remaining broth in skillet. Add wine to broth
and simmer over high heat until broth is reduced by half. Stir in red
pepper puree, apple jelly and lemon juice and season to taste with
salt and pepper. Strain sauce, then nap bottom of serving platter or
individual plates with some of sauce and cover with sole squares.
