Title: FRASER CANYON BANNOCK
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Flour
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Baking powder
2 tb Brown sugar
2 tb Lard
2/3 c  Water
Mix together dry ingredients; cut in lard with a pastry blender until
mixture resembles fine crumbs. Sprikle water over pastry, a little at
a time, stirring with a fork until mixture forms a soft dough. Turn
dough out onto a light floured board. Knead about 10 times. Roll out
to 1/2 inch thick circle; place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at
450 for 10-15 minutes until golden. Cut in wedges and serve hot with
butter.

** This is the city slicker method, now on to the "native" method,
the one that native Indians used long before the white man came to
the Caribou.*

Same ingredients.  Put in bowl and mix with hands until thoroughly
combined. Work with dough until it feels soft and satiny, about 3-5
minutes.  Take handful of dough and pat between palms until you get a
saucer sized form. Wrap around sturdy stick and cook over open camp
fire until golden brown. Can be eaten alone, broken in pieces and
buttered and jammed, or if you want to get fancy, stuff with cooked
ground beef mixture. The best way to eat it is at night when the kids
have gone to bed, and you are sitting around the campfire swapping
horror stories. Eat it plain, it is fantastic.
