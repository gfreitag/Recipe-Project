Categories: Pasta, Italian, Dairy, Mrs. g, Sauces
Yield: 4 Servings
- G Granaroli XBRG76A
2 oz Mozzarella
2 oz Gruyere
2 oz Fontina
2 oz Mild Provolone
1/4 c  Butter
1/2 ts Flour
1 1/8 c  Milk
12 oz Pasta
Salt
Pepper
Grated cheese
Heat half the butter in a pan. When it melts add the flour. When it
begins to bubble add the milk and mix well. Cook on low for 5 min. It
will start to thicken. Mix often to avoid lumping and sticking. Cut
all the cheese into smallstrips. Gradually add the cheese mixing well
while it melts into a velvety sauce. Season with salt and pepper and
serve over hot, cooked pasta of your choice. Top with grated cheese.
**You may vary some of the cheeses, but never the Fontina. That is
the essential flavor.
