Pastry: Toss flour with spoon and lightly measure leveling off each
cup. Combine flour and salt in large bowl. With pastry blender cut in
shortening to size of small peas. Add cold water, tossing with a fork
until pastry clings together. Press firmly into a ball and divide in
half. Filling: In 2 qt. saucepan, melt margarine and saute onion
until clear. Add rice, stirring to coat. Add 11/2 cup water, cover
and steam over low heat until tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in
parsley, cool, cover and chill. Remove backbone and skin from canned
salmon and break into large flakes.

Sauce: Make a roux with margarine and flour. Stir in liquid and cook
over medium heat stirring constantly until thickened. Stir in dill
weed, season salt and shrimp. Cool.

To assemble: Draw a fish shape on light cardboard to fit diagonally
on a large baking sheet. Roll out pastry and cut out fish shape.
Place on sheet. Spread rice mixture over pastry within 1" of edge.
Arrange fish over rice. Spoon sauce over salmon. Roll out remaining
pastry to cover and gently place over fish. Moisten edge with ice
water and press top crust to seal. Cut excess pastry from around
edge. Create fish scales by pressing with fork. Using a knife, cut in
slit for mouth and x for eye. With scissors, make rows of snips 1"
apart along back toward tail. Brush with beaten egg. Bake at 425 for
15 minutes, then at 375 for 40-45 minutes until golden brown. Slide
off end of tray onto serving platter. (May need to cool slightly to
firm crust before moving.) Garnish with lemon slice twists and
parsley and place green olive slice for eye. Serves 10-12.
