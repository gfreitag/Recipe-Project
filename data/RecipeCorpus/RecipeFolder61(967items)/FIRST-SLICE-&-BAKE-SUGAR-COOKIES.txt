Combine flour, salt & baking powder. With an electric mixer at
medium-low speed, beat the butter & sugar until light & fluffy. Beat
in egg & vanilla. Reduce speed to low, beat in flour mixture until
just combined. Divide dough in half & shape each piece into a log
about 1" in diameter. Cover with plastic wrap, & twist the ends of
the wrap to force dough into a smooth cylinder. Refridgerate until
almost firm (about 30 min). Spread about half the nuts on a work
surface (a wide, 2" deep plastic container works well, and is
re-sealable afterwards for storage). Roll one log in the nuts so that
the entire surface is coated. Re-wrap & chill for at least 30 min.
Repeat with the other log. Heat oven to 350~. Cut the chilled dough
into slices about 3/8" thick. Put on ungreased baking sheets about 2"
apart, & bake until edges start to brown, about 8-10 min.

Options:  Replace Nuts with coloured sprinkles, or coloured sugar
crystals. Or with the tiny coloured chocolate chips you can find in
Bulk stores (very festive).  Or coconut, dyed or white. Use your
imagination, anything tiny (& edible) will work.
