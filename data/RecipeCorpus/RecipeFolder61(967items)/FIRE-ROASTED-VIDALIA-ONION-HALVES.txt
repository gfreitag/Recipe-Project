8    Whole sweet onions --
Vidalia

Place each onion half, cut side up, on a 10-inch square of heavy-duty

pepper. Turn onions cut side down; pat a piece of bacon onto the side
of each one. Fold foil into neat packets. Heat grill to medium hot.
Place foil packets on grill; cook for 20 to 30 minutes (if grill
becomes too hot, move onions to a cooler part), until tender and
slightly charred. Let onions cool in packets for 15 minutes. Remove
foil, reserving juices; discard bacon. Serve onions warm or at room
temperature on a platter with Spice-Rubbed salmon; drizzle remaining
juices over top.
