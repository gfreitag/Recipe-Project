Title: FF NO-CREAM ASPARAGUS SOUP (VEGAN)
Categories: Digest, Nov., Opt. lacto
Yield: 1 Servings
2 md Onions, chopped
2 md Leeks (white and pale green
Parts only), chopped
6 c  Vegetable stock
2 lb Asparagus, each cut into 4
Pieces
x  White pepper
1 pk Butter buds (optional)
Microwave the onions and leeks until tender or saute in water over
medium heat until tender.  Add stock and the asparagus and simmer
until tender, about 15 minutes. Puree soup in blender in batches and
strain through a fine strainer.  Return to pot and season with white
pepper to taste. You may now add the butter buds if you desire a
butter flavor.

Makes about 8 cups.  Can be served hot or cold.  Keeps well in the
refrigerator for several days.

I use this as my basic soup recipe and have successfully replaced the
asparagus with beets, broccoli, carrot, acorn squash, butternut
squash, and red kuri squash. You can make quite an impression by
making both the acorn and butternut squash soups at the same time and
serving them in the same bowl.  Just slowly pour both soups into
opposite sides of the bowl at the same time.  I usually serve this
with garlic croutons.
