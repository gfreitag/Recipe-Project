"I like to bring my mom's fruit salad to potlucks. It's smooth sauce
combined with all the colorful fruit makes it different than any other
fruit salad I've tried. I've given out the recipe more times than I
can remember." - Anne Heinonen Drain pineapple, reserving 1 cup juice
in a small saucepan. Set pineapple aside. To saucepan, add sugar,
flour, eggs, orange juice, lemon juice and oil. Bring to a boil,
stirring constantly. Boil for 1 minute; remove from the heat and let
cool. In a salad bowl, combine the pineapple, fruit cocktail, oranges
and bananas. Fold in whipped cream and cooled sauce. Chill for
