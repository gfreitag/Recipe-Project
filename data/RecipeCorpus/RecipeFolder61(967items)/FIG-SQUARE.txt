Title: FIG SQUARE
Categories: Breads, Vegetarian
Yield: 16 Servings
1 pk (or 1 tablespoon) Active
-Dried Yeast
1/4 c  Warm Water (110 to 115
-degrees)
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Vegetable Oil
1/2 c  Milk, at room temperature
1    Egg
1 ts Orange Rind, grated
1 c  Whole Wheat Flour
1 1/2 c  Unbleached White Flour
1 1/2 c  Dried Figs, snipped
1 c  Water
1/2 ts Ground Allspice
Confectioners' Sugar
-(optional)
Soften the yeast in the warm water.  Combine the sugar, salt, oil,
milk, egg and orange rind in a large bowl. Beat well. Add the yeast
mixture and the 1 cup of whole wheat flour. Beat. Add the remaining
flour. Extra flour may be needed if the dough is sticky.

Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5
minutes. Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel and let
rise for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, prepare the fig filling by combining the figs, water and
allspice in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer
until the mixture is thick. Mash the figs with a potato masher or
large spoon during cooking. Cool.

Punch down the dough.  Roll into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle 8 inches
wide. Spread with the fig filling. Roll up like a jelly roll. Fit
into a lightly oiled 8-inch-square pan. Seal the edges together. At
each corner cut with a scissors to fit into the shape of the pan.
Make two slashes on top of each side. Let rise until doubled, about
30 minutes. Bake in a 350-degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Cool.

May be sprinkled lightly with confectioners' sugar just before
serving.
