Title: FREEZER BREAD DOUGH
Categories: Bread/yeast, Homemade mi
Yield: 76 Servings
2 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
2 pk Dry yeast
2 c  Skim milk
3 tb Margarine -- melted
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
2 ts Salt
2    Egg whites -- whipped
5 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
In a mixing bowl, combine 2 1/2 cups flour and yeast. In a saucepan,
heat milk, margarine, sugar, and salt just until warm (115 to 120
degrees), stirring constantly until margarine almost melts. Add
liquid to dry ingredients in mixing bowl along with egg whites. Beat
at low speed for 1/2 minute, scraping sides of bowl constantly. Beat
3 minutes at high speed. Stir in remaining flour as you can mix in
with a spoon. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in
enough flour to make a stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8
minutes total). Divide dough into thirds. Shape each of 2 portions
into loaves. Store in freezer container with a double thickness of
waxed paper between. Divide remaining dough into 16 balls. Arrange
balls 1" apart in a freezer container.
