Place Rock Cornish game hen halves, skin side down, on hot grill
rack; cook, covered with grill cover, 10 minutes. Turn hens over;
cook, covered, another 10 minutes. Brush hot red pepper sauce
liberally over chicken; cook, covered, 5 minutes longer until chicken
is cooked through.
Serve when chicken is well glazed, garnishing with herb sprigs.
NOTE: Hens may be baked in oven. Heat oven to 450F. Prepare sauce
as directed. Place hen halves, skin side up, in a baking or roasting
pan. Bake 25 minutes until cooked through. Brush sauce over hens;
cook 10 minutes longer until sauce begins to brown.
