1/2 c  Flour
1/2 c  Salt
Water*
Food coloring
*1/2 to 3/4 cup, enough to make the consistancy of a thick gravy.
Mix the food coloring into the water and then add the salt and
flour. Mix well.
Note: I bought the Tupperware small snack cups (the ones in red,
blue, yellow and green) and then matched the colors. It makes a great
gift and easy to find the color.
