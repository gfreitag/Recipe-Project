Title: FRANK & VEGETABLE CASSEROLE
Categories: Casseroles
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Frankfurters, boiled

20 oz Broccoli spears

20 oz Cauliflower (frozen),
-cooked
6 lg Potatoes, diced
-and cooked (approx.)
1 lb Cheddar cheese, sliced
Thinly slice franks (18-20 slices per frank).  Break cauliflower into
bite sized florets.  Separate broccoli into individual spears.

Combine all franks and vegetables in a 6-8 quart pot and mix well.
Spread into baking pan(s).  (I use 2 9x9 baking pans.) Cover
ingredients with a layer of sliced cheese.

If cooking immediately, bake uncovered at 350 degrees F. for 15
minutes or until cheese melts.  If coming from refrigerator, cook
covered at 350 degrees F. for 30-35 minutes, then uncovered for 10-15
minutes until cheese melts and ingredients are evenly warmed.

NOTES:

*  Casserole with frankfurters, vegetables and cheese.

*  As a variation, cube half of the cheese and mix in with the
vegetables, then top with remaining sliced cheese.

: Difficulty:  Easy.
: Time:  45 minutes cooking, 15 minutes preparation, 15 minutes
baking. : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
