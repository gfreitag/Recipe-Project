Categories: Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 5 Servings
16    California dried figs
1    No.2 can pie cherries
1 ts Cinnamon
2 tb Cake flour
1 c  Sugar
3 tb Butter; melted
Biscuit dough
With scissors, snip off fig stems, and cut figs into small bits. In a
pudding dish, combine figs, cherries and their syrup. Mix cinnamon,
cake flour and sugar together and stir into fruit. Melt butter and
stir into fruit.  Make half the amount of your favorite biscuit
recipe - or use biscuit mix - and be sure to add 1 Tbsp. sugar and 1
tsp. cinnamon and 3 Tbsps. more milk than the recipe calls for. Drop
biscuit dough from a teaspoon onto the fruit.  Bake in a hot oven
(450 F.) for 6 minutes, then lower heat to moderate (350 F.) for
about 20 minutes or until cobbler is bubbly and biscuits are quite
done.  Serves 5 or 6. Extra good when served with top milk or cream
flavored with cinnamon, vanilla and generously sweetened.
