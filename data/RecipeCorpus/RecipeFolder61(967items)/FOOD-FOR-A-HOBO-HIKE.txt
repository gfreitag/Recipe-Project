Title: FOOD FOR A HOBO HIKE
Categories: Fish, Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
4 cn Tuna (3 oz each)
4 cn Baked beans (6 oz each)
4    Oranges
4    Plastic
4    Bandana clots
4    Children
Place 1 can tuna, 1 can beans, 1 orange, and 1 fork on each banadana.
Bring up corners and tie securely.  Tie end to children's belt loop
or attach to a stick and send them off on their hobo hike. Pack
another hobo pouch for yourself and go along.  Make sure someone has
a Scout knife with a can opener attachment to open cans (much more
fun struggling with one of these things than to take a conventional
can opener).  The oranges serve as both a drink and a dessert.  Poke
a hole in one end and after all the juice has been sucked out, open
it and eat the flesh. The tuna and beans, of course, are eaten just
as they come from the can. The bandanas serve as little tablecloths,
napkins, and kerchiefs to be worn back home. Children love this hobo
picnic--it's easy for you, nutritious, filling, and fun from them.
