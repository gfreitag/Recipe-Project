Categories: Soups, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 c  Butter, unsalted
1 md Onion, coarsely chopped
1 1/2    Carrots ***
3    Celery ***
2 sm Leeks ***
6    Parsley stems
2    Garlic, cloves, crushed,
-- peeled
2    Bay leaves
1/2 ts Juniper, berries
1 lg Tomato, cut into wedges
3 lb Bones, fish, and trimmings
1 c  Wine, white, dry
6 c  Water, cold (approximately)
1/4 ts Salt (or to taste)
4    Clams
8    Oysters, shucked
1 oz Mung bean threads **
8    Radicchio leaves
1/4 ts Saffron threads
** Soak the mung bean threads (also called cellophane noodles)
in hot water for twenty minutes. Drain, and cut into 2-inch lengths.
Set aside.

*** Split the carrots, celery and leeks lengthwise in half.
Clean, peel, and slice the vegetables into 1/2-inch-thick slices.

Melt the butter in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the
onions, carrots, leeks, parsley, garlic, bay leaves and juniper
berries, tossing the mixture well to coat with butter. When the
vegetables begin to sizzle, reduce the heat to medium low and cover.
Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.

Add the tomato to the stockpot and stir for 1 minute. Add the
fish bones and trimmings and white wine. Cook this mixture for 5
minutes, stirring occasionally. Add cold water to cover and raise
heat to medium high.  Bring to a boil, skimming all of the froth from
the surface as it forms.  Immediately lower heat and simmer gently,
uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes.  Strain the mixture, pressing the
solids firmly to extract all liquid.  Discard the solids. Add salt to
taste.

Heat 4 cups fish broth in a saucepan.  Steam clams separately in
small amount of broth just until shells open, removing each shell as
it opens. Transfer to 4 warm soup bowls; strain clam broth into warm
fish broth, avoiding any grit at the bottom.

Add oysters to fish broth and cook gently over low heat,
uncovered, just until edges curl, about 1 minute. Place 2 oysters in
each bowl. Ladle warm broth into bowls and add 2 tablespoons mung
bean threads. Add radicchio leaves and saffron and serve.
