Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease six 6-oz custard cups. Heat
the butter in a 10-inch skillet, over medium heat until it is melted.
Cook the onion in the butter until tender but not browned. Add the
halibut or cod pieces and the milk, then heat to simmering (Do NOT
boil) and reduce the heat.  Cover and simmer for 5 minutes or until
the fish flakes easily with a fork.  Place the mixture in a food
processor work bowl or blender container.  Cover and process on high
speed about 1 minute, stopping the blender occasionally to scrape the
sides, until smooth. Mix the fish mixture, bread crumbs, slat,
nutmeg, pepper and the eggs together. Pour into the custard cups.
Place the cups in a rectangular pan, 13 X 9 X 2-inches, on the oven
rack.  Pour very hot water into the pan to within 1/2 inch of the
tops of the cups. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven or until
a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Unmold and serve with
the Curry Sauce.

CURRY SAUCE:

Stir in the flour, curry powder, salt and pepper. Cook over low heat,
stirring constantly, until smooth and bubbly then remove from the
