Title: FIESTA RICE
Categories: Rice, Mexican
Yield: 6 Servings
1 md Onion finely chopped
1/2 sm Green pepper, chopped
3 tb Margarine or butter
16 oz Stewed tomatoes
1 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
3 c  Cooked rice
Cook and stir onion and green pepper in margarine in 10 inch skillet
until onion is tender.  Stir in tomatoes, salt, pepper and rice.
Simmer uncovered over low heat until hot, about 15 minutes. My
husband likes dry rice as well, I haven't timed it when I make this
so you may need to cook it longer to get it to the consistency you
want it.
