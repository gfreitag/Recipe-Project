**To make the garlic croutons, cut crusts from thick, day-old bread.
Cut bread into large cubes.  Spread a cookie sheet with garlic oil -
either oil in which whole garlic cloves have been steeped, or oil
that has been heated gently with a cut garlic clove, pressing on
clove to release oils. Toss croutons in the garlic oil, then bake at
400 F., turning often, 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown.

If frozen, unwrap fish and allow to stand at room temperature for 15
to 20 minutes, or until soft enough to cut. With a sharp knife, cut
into 2" cubes.

Meanwhile, heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan.  Add prepared onions,
carrots and celery and saute, stirring, 3 to 5 minutes over medium
heat. Add garlic and saute another 1 or 2 minutes. Add tomatoes (and
their juices), stock and wine.  Tie bouquet garni spices in a
cheesecloth bag and attach with string to pot handle for easy
removal. Place in tomato-wine mixture and let come to a boil,
uncovered.  Boil 5 to 10 minutes, then reduce heat to low.  Add fish
cubes and cover pot. Simmer 15 minutes or until fish flakes easily
with a fork.

Serve on top of garlic croutons in heated bowls, garnished with
chopped fennel or parsley.

Yield: 4 to 5 servings.
