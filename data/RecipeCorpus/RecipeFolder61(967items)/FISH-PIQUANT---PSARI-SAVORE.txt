Categories: Greek, Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
Karen Mintzias
1 kg Fish
Seasoned flour
Oil for frying
3    Garlic cloves;
- finely chopped
1 ts Rosemary spikes
1/4 c  Wine vinegar
1/4 c  Dry white wine or water
Any fish suitable for frying may be used - whole fish, fish slices or
fillets.

Coat with seasoned flour and shallow fry in hot oil until golden
brown and cooked through.  Drain on absorbant paper and place in a
single layer in a serving dish.  Keep hot.

Drain most of the oil from the pan, leaving about 1 tablespoon.
Return pan to heat and add garlic, rosemary and 3 teaspoons of the
seasoned flour. Stir well and cook until flour is golden.

Remove pan from heat and pour in vinegar, swirling pan contents to
blend. Return to heat and stir in wine or water. Let sauce bubble
gently for 1 minute.  Pour over sauce and serve immediately.

Note: Trout is exceptionally good prepared this way.
