Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------YIELD: 18 COOKIES--------------------------
2 ea Eggs
1/3 c  Honey
1/2 c  Unbleached flour
1/3 ts Banana; or lemon extract
1 ea Beat the eggs with the egg
-beater or the electric
Mixer for two minutes.
2 ea Add the honey gradually to
-the eggs and beat for 10
MINUTES more.
3 ea Slowly add the flour to the
-egg/honey mixture after
the 10 minutes of beating. Keep beating until the mixture is smooth.
4. Add the extract and beat for 2 more minutes. 5. Warm the frying
pan over a low heat (or turn the electric grill on to low). 6. Drop
the cookie batter by tablespoons into the frying pan or onto the
electric grill. Make sure that you leave space between cookies; you
don't want them running into each other in the pan. You will have to
make several batches. 7. Toast the cookies about 1/2 minute on each
side. Turn them over with the spatula. Keep cooking and turning them
until they are light brown. This should only take a few minutes. 8.
As each panful is toasted and while the cookies are still hot, remove
the cookies, place them on a clean surface and place a strip of your
fortune telling paper into the center of each. Fold up* the cookies.
9. Put the cookies on a rack to cool. 10. Make another batch. Notes:
FOLDING: This is a case of a picture being worth a thousand words,
but the general idea is: 1. Fold the cookie in half, (with the
fortune inside). 2. Bring the two "points/corners" together towards
the back, as if you were going to fold into quarters, but keep the
pancake flat. "You can have some fun with your family and friends
with these cookies. Before you begin baking them, write out fortunes
on 18 Small pieces of paper (about 1/2x1-1/2 inches). Set these aside
within easy reach because you will be inserting them in the cookies
as you make them. ++++-
