Yield: 2 Servings

75 ml Water
40 g  Mozzarella, sliced

Substantial, warming food for cold weather, this dish is rich and
nourishing. Gorgeous with a mixed salad dressed with a garlicky
vinaigrette.

Cover the rice with the water and bring to the boil. Then cover with
a lid and simmer until all the water is absorbed, about 2-10 minutes.
Stir it to fluff it up then toss in all the cheeses and the herbs.
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Finally fold in the beaten egg
and put the dish in a pre-heated oven at 220 degrees C / 425 degrees
F / gas 7 for 8-10 minutes. Serve very hot.
