Categories: Poultry
Yield: 15 Servings
1 c  Minced mushrooms
2    Cloves garlic -- minced
1/4 c  Minced onion
1/4 c  Sherry
1 ts Olive oil
3 tb Chopped parsley
1/2 c  Crumbled feta cheese
1/4 c  Grated low-fat mozzarella
Cheese
1/4 ts Dried oregano
1/4 ts Dried thyme
1/4 lb Finely minced smoked turkey
Or ham -- trimmed of fat
15    Sheets filo dough
1/3 c  Unsalted butter -- melted
1. In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute mushrooms, garlic,
and onion in sherry and olive oil until soft. Add parsley, feta,
mozzarella, oregano, thyme, and turkey. Remove from heat.

2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil two 9- by 12-inch baking
sheets.

3. Lay filo dough on a clean, dry surface. Cut each sheet in half
widthwise to make 30 smaller sheets. Stack them evenly on top of each
other, and cover with a piece of plastic wrap and a slightly dampened
dish towel as you do the next step.

4. Butter 1 sheet and cut into 3 long strips. Lay the 3 strips on top
of each other. Place about 2 tablespoons of filling in the lower
right section near the edge. Fold bottom right corner of filo over
filling to meet left edge, creating a small triangle. Continue
folding pastry, as you would a flag, until you reach the top. You
will end up with a triangle-shaped pastry.

5. Lightly butter top of filled triangle and place on prepared baking
sheet. Repeat process until all the filling has been used.

6. Bake pastries until golden (20 minutes). Serve warm.

Makes 30 pastries.
