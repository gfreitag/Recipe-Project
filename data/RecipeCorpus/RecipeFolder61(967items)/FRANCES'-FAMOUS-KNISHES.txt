Title: FRANCES' FAMOUS KNISHES
Categories: Appetizers, Jewish, Potatoes, Side dishes
Yield: 36 Servings
2 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Shortening
1 lg Onion -- diced
2 lb Potatoes -- peeled
3 tb Oil -- or chicken fat
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
Cook potatoes in water.  In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder, 1/2
teaspoon salt and shortenng, blending with your fingers. Add 2/3 cup
watr from the cooking potatoes. Knead lightly. Dough should be soft,
but firm enough to roll. Add a bit more flour, if necessary. Smooth
into a ball and cover bowl.

Brown onion in oil.  Drain and mash potatoes and add onion. Add salt
and pepper.  Roll 1/3 of the dough into a thin rectangle, about
7"x14". Place a strip of potato mixture about 1 1/2" wide and high
along the long edge. Roll like a jelly roll. Cut into 1 1/4" pieces.
Take each piece and stretch the dough to cover the cut edges,
unrolling slightly, if necessary. Knishes should be flat on the
bottom and rounded on top. Don't worry if the dough tears of potato
shows through. Repeat the process twice more with the remaining dough
and potatoes.

Place knishes on greased pans.  Bake 30 minutes at 400F, or until
slightly browned.  If they are going to be frozen, bake only
partially, and finish baking when ready to serve.
