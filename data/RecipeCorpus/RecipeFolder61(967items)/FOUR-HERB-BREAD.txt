This recipe works well in the large size loaf machines. I have a Dak
R2D2 machine. If you don't have the herbs called for, you can
substitute whatever herbs you like. Put all the ingredients in, in
the order listed (if using a dak), or in the order your machine
likes. Select the white bread setting and a medium crust setting.
Depending on your climate you may need to add a TBS more of water. I
usually use Gluten, but when I first made this WITH gluten it
exploded over the top of the pan and onto the dome. So I dont put
gluten in the recipe. I think it has something to do with the B for B
flour. I seem to use less gluten in the breads when I am using that
flour. Formatted by Elaine Radis
