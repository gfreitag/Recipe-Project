Title: FRANK'S N'AWLINS SCALLOPED POTATOES
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
8 c  Potatoes - raw, white,
-thin-sliced
6 tb All purpose flour
2 ts Salt
1 ts Black pepper
1 c  Onion - minced
1/2 c  Green onions - finely
-sliced
1/2 c  Parsley finely chopped
5 c  Milk - scalded
2 tb Butter - (1 ounce)
First, take a 4-quart casserole dish and butter the bottom and sides.
Then mix together well the flour, salt and black pepper, and preheat
your oven to 350F degrees. Next, take one-third of the Potatoes and
make a layer on the bottom of the casserole dish.  Then sprinkle the
slices gently with one-third of the flour mixture. Then sprinkle on
one-third of the onions, green onions and parsley.  [I'd mix these
together well and then separate into thirds.] Repeat this process
until you "layer on" all the Potatoes, flour, onions, green onions
and parsley. Now, scald the milk and melt the butter into it. And
when thoroughly blended, gently pour the mixture uniformly over the
layer Potatoes. At this point, cover the casserole with tight-fitting
aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Then uncover the dish and bake
for another hour (or until the Potatoes are browned and tender).
Serve 'em piping hot! And you'd better have enough for seconds!
