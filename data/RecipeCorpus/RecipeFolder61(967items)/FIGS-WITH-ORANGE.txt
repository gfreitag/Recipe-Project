1    Cinnamon stick

This is a wonderful way to use dried figs, poaching them in an orange
syrup and then adding fresh orange segments. You can make this
dessert at any time of the year, served with a delicious mixture of
Greek yogurt and honey.

Put the orange juice and sugar into a pan with the spices and heat
gently until the sugar dissolves. Add the figs and lemon juice, and
put in enough water to just cover the fruit. Cover the pan and simmer
gently for 5 minutes. Remove the figs and boil the syrup hard until
it reduces. Pour over the figs, add the orange segments, and chill.
Just before serving, stir the honey into the Greek yogurt and pass it
around to spoon over the fig dish.
