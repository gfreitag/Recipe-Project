Title: FLAESKEAEGGEKAGE (BACON & EGG CAKE)
Categories: Denmark, Cheese/eggs, Ham/pork, Appetizers, Upload
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Bacon; preferably Danish
6    Eggs; lightly beaten
1 tb Flour, all-purpose
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Milk, whole
3 tb Chives; finely cut
Cut strips of bacon in half crosswise. Fry over moderate heat, but
DO NOT let them get too crisp. Drain on paper towels, set aside in
warm 200F oven. Reserve 1 tablespoon bacon drippings.
Beat flour and salt into eggs only long enough to combine them.
Slowly beat in the milk. Warm the reserved bacon drippings over
moderate heat in a 10" heavy skillet and pour in egg mixture. Turn
heat very low and let the eggs set into a firm custard. Do not stir.
This should take about 20 minutes. An asbestos pad will help prevent
the bottom of the egg cake from burning.
Arrange bacon slices and chivers over the top of the finished cake.
Serve directly from the pan.
