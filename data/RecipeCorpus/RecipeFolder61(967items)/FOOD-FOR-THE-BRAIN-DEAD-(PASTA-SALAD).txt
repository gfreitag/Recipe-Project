Title: FOOD FOR THE BRAIN DEAD (PASTA SALAD)
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
x  Frozen mixed vegetables
x  Sweet potato
x  Bottled fatfree dressing
x  Cooked pasta
I went home from work last night, too tired and frustrated from a day
of working on the office budget to think about going out to eat and
completely disinterested in being creative.  I came up with a bag of
frozen mixed veggies, cut up a sweet potato and nuked it all, then I
added a bit of a bottled fatfree dressing intended for salads and put
it over pasta.
