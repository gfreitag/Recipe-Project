Forfar Bridies are a great specialty in Angus, and on market day
people come from all over Angus to enjoy the Forfar Bridies. They are
the Scottish equivalent of Cornish pasties.

Prepare pastry and roll out dough on floured board into 4 large
ovals. Cut the steak into 1/2 inch squares. Chop suet finely. Place
the meat in a bowl with the onions and suet, add seasonings and mix
well. Divide into 4 portions and place on each oval. Wet the edge of
the pastry and fold each oval in half, crimping the edge with your
finger and thumb. Make a hole in the top of each. Bake on a greased
baking sheet for 45 minutes. Oven = 400 degrees F. Serve hot.
