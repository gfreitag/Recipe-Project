Title: FLEA BASHER
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Baking soda
1/4 c  Corn starch
1/2 c  Diatomaceous earth
diatomaceous earth: not the kind used for pool; the kind sold at
nursery stores such as Nurseryland Garden Centers or Orange County
Farm Supply in Orange.  Your carpets should be vacuumed, cleaned and
dry. Cover fish tanks and any electronic equipment that could be
damaged by powder. Cover your nose and mouth with a dust mask, sold
at hardware or drugstores. Keep your pets, incliding birds, out of
the way until the dust has settled. Using a flour sifter, sprinkle
the mixture liberally on all carpeted areas, including under
furniture and in closets. Rub it in with a broom. Wait at least 24
hours and vacuum, then vacuum frequently. DO NOT USE THE MIXTURE ON
YOUR PET. MORE IMPORTANT-do not let children breath this.
