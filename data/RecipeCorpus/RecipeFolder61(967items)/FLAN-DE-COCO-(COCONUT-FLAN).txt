1 c  Sugar
2 c  Half-and-half or light cream
4 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
2 lg Egg yolks
1/2 c  Tightly packed finely
-chopped shredded sweetened
-coconut
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
Fresh berries for garnish
1 ea Preheat the oven to 350
-degrees. In a small, heavy
-saucepan over
medium heat, cook 1/2 cup of the sugar, stirring constantly after it
starts to bubble, until it caramelizes, 6 to 8 minutes. Divide the
syrup among 8 custard cups, or pour into a 2-quart ovenproof mold,
and swirl to coat the bottom. Set aside. 2. In a medium-size, heavy
saucepan over medium heat, heat the half-and-half and sugar almost to
scalding, and set aside. 3. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and yolks
together until blended. Gradually add the cooled half-and-half,
coconut, and vanilla, and mix well. 4. Pour the mixture into the
prepared custard cups or mold, place in a large pan, and fill the
outer pan with lukewarm water two thirds the height of the cups or
mold. Bake 1 hour for a large mold and slightly less for custard
cups, or until a cake tester inserted in the flan comes out clean.
Remove from the water bath, allow to cool to room temperature, cover,
and refrigerate. 5. To unmold, run a knife along the inner edge of
the mold or cups and invert the custard onto a plate. Spoon the
caramel over the top and garnish with fresh berries. Makes 8 servings
Variation: Combine 1 pint of berries with sugar to taste, puree in a
food processor fitted with a steel blade or blender, and spoon around
the flan. FLAN DE COCO Coconut Flan
