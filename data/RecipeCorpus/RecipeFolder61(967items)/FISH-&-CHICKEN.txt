Grilled Fish A La Marocaine

This picante, pungent Moroccan marinade can be used for any fish
suitable for grilling or broiling and can also be used to marinate
fish before baking.  It's good with firm, white fleshed fish.
Directions: Pound together the garlic, salt, cilantro, paprika, cumin
and cayenne. Stir in the lemon juice and olive oil. Marinate fish
steaks or whole fish in this for several hours, turning from time to
time.

Grill the fish for 4 minutes for each 1/2 inch thickness, turning
halfway through. Baste with the marinade and serve at once, garnished
with additional cilantro. Chill leftovers and serve cold the next day.
