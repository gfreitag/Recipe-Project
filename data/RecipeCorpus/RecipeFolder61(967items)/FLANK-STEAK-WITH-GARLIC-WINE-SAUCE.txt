Title: FLANK STEAK WITH GARLIC WINE SAUCE
Categories: Garlic, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Flank Steak (1 piece)
1 x  Salt & Pepper, To Taste
2 tb Unsalted Butter
2 tb Unsalted Butter, Softened
2 tb Thinly Slice Scallions
1 c  Dry Red Wine
1 x  Garlic Puree(1 head Roasted)
Sprinkle flank steak with salt and a generous amount of freshly ground
black pepper.  Heat a wide heavy skillet. Do not add fat. When hot,
cook seasoned steak until seared and well browned on each side (about
1 minute per side).  Reduce heat and add 2 T butter. Cook 3 to 5
minutes on each side.  For best results, the meat should be quite
rare. Remove the meat from the pan and keep warm.  Pour off the fat
in the skillet and add the scallions and red wine.  Bring to a boil
and whisk in the garlic puree. Boil until the wine is reduced by
half, thickened, and syrupy. As it boils, scrape up the browned bits
in the skillet with a wooden spoon. Stir in the meat juices that have
accumulated unter the flank steak. Boil for 1 or 2 seconds more.
Remove from the heat.  Gently swirl in the 2 T soften butter so that
it incorporates into the wine. Quickly slice the meat, against the
grain, into thin strips. Arrange the slices on a hot platter, pour
sauce down the center of them and serve at once.
