Combine the crust ingredients in a mixing bowl. Spread crust across

Put the filling ingredients in a food processor; blender, or electric
mixer bowl. Process (or blend) until smooth then pour gently over the
graham cracker crust. Bake in a 375 degree oven for 30 to 35 minutes
or until done. (The top will be brown and circular cracks will
appear. If you shake the pan, the cheesecake should quiver slightly,
as if it were custard. Do not overcook.) Take the cheesecake out of
the oven. Leave the oven on. In a mixing bowl, combine the sour cream
topping ingredients and stir until blended. Spread the sour cream
topping over the top of the hot cheesecake. Return cheesecake to the
oven for 5 minutes. Remove cheesecake from the oven. Let cool on the
counter for about one hour.
Refrigerate at least 3 hours, preferably overnight. ENJOY ! !
