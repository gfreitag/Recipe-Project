Title: FINAL SCREAM RED HABANERO PASTE BY BALOO
Categories: Redhabanero, Spice paste, Baloo
Yield: 5 Deciliter
1/2 kg Red Habanero - fresh
1 dl Redwine Vinegar
2 dl Thyme - fresh
2 tb Cumin
3 tb Salt
Remove the stems and the seeds from the habanero. DON'T REMOVE THE
VEINS! Put all ingredients in a food processor, using the steel
blade, and mix 10 minutes until you have a smooth paste.  This sauce
is best when used fresh, but if you want to make enough to keep for
some weeks or months you can boil it and put in sterilised jars.
This makes a fruity but EXTREMELY HOT chile sauce. Be careful.

Wash your hands with 80% alcohol after you handled the habaneros!
Don't touch your eyes or your private parts before you have washed
your hands with alcohol! It will burn for hours.
