Fresh fish filets or steaks
;(thick halibut or salmon

2 c  Olive oil

-Garnish
Lemon Wedges
Place the garlic, rosemary, oregano, parsley and black pepper in a
food processor and chop coarsely.  Rub both sides of desired fish and
place in a glass baking dish. (Do not add any salt or acids such as
lemon juice or vinegar at this time!)  Add the oil and turn the fish
a couple of times. The fish should be nearly or completely submerged
in the oil. For best results, the fish should be covered and
refrigated overnight. You may also marinate it for a few hours.

To cook, pat off the excess oil and lightly salt to taste. Grill,
broil, or bake to your liking.  Do not over cook! Serve with lemon
wedges. The leftover herbed oil can be refrigerated for a few day and
reused only for fresh seafood preparation.
