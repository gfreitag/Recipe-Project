Title: FREE FORM TART SHELLS
Categories: New, Text, Import
Dough:
Yield: 4 Servings  :
1/4 c  granulated sugar
1 c  flour
1/4 ts salt
1/8 ts baking powder
8 TB unsalted butter, cut into
tblp pieces, -- very cold
:
1    egg mixed with 1 teaspoon
water
:

In a food processor, combine the sugar, flour, salt, baking powder.
When well combined, add the butter and pulse the machine until the
butter is broken up into the flour mixture. Add the egg and water and
process until the dough forms a dough.

Transfer the dough into waxed paper; pat it (with floured hands if
need be) into a flat round and refrigerate for 30 to 45 minutes or
until it has relaxed and you can roll it out.

Divide the dough into approximately 8 equal pieces. On a lightly
floured board roll out the pieces until slightly thicker than
1/8th-inch thick. Rather than bother fitting them into tartlet shells
and prebaking them, simply shape them into rough rounds (3 inches or
3 1/2 inches round) or cut them into hearts or rectangles. Transfer
the free form shapes to a baking sheet and chill 20 minutes while you
preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Scraps can be shaped into smaller
cookies.

Prick the dough with a fork (just as you would the bottom dough of a
tartlet shell) so the dough doesn't puff up. Bake for 10 to 12
minutes or until edges are brown. Remove them from the oven to a rack
and let them cool. When completely cool top with whatever you like.

Yield: dough for 8 free-form tarts
