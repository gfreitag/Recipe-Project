:

*This will do for a whole flank steak, but with just the two of us I
use about 1/3 of a flank steak. This is so good that I serve it to
company with my famousMarchand de Vin sauce. It is great because 1)
there is no oil in the marinade and 2) flank steak is just about the
lowest fat of beef around. I've tried the low sodium soy sauce,
yukkkkkkk. So if sodium is a problem, you may have to skip this one.

Mix marinade ingredients.  Marinade beef an hour or so at room temp,
or overnight in the frig.  Turn occasionally or put in reclosable bag
and press out air. Broil to your liking. Recipe By
