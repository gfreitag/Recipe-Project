VANILLA ICE CREAM In a medium heavy sauce pan, combine the cream
and the half and half. Split the vanilla beans in half lengthwise
and, using the tip of a knife, scrape out the small seeds into the
cream mixture and drop in the pods. Bring the mixture to a boil, then
remove from the heat. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks
and sugar until thickened and pale. Pour in the hot cream mixture and
stir until well combined. Strain into a large container and
refrigerate until cold. Wash and dry the vanilla pods and reserve for
another use. When the cream mixture is cold, pour it into the bowl of
an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturers
instructions. Yield: 3 cups From: Abra Bennett
