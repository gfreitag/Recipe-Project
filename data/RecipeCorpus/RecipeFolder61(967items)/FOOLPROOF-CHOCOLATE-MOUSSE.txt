Title: FOOLPROOF CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
1 pk Chocolate instant pudding
1    Cool Whip or Whipped Cream
Make the pudding according to package directions. Fold it into some
Cool Whip or Whipped Cream. Refrigerate. Eat.

Notes from Brett Jones: "...first, you get something that tastes
almost exactly like the real thing and second, it always sets (unless
you add too much whipped cream!) and is rarely grainy.

Variations:  Swirl a little raspberry jam through it or add your
favorite liqueur.
