Second Part: Flavoring oils and vinegars.

Class from Cook's of Crocus Hill class in the fall of 1993.

OILS; Garlic in oil at room temperature is dangerous.

Put herbs in jar-press down-Pour oil over all. Olive oil or canola
oil. A mixture is nice. Cover and put in the fridg for 7 to 10 days.
Take out and let warm to room temperature if the oil is hard. Strain
and put back in the fridg. I have frozen oil with sucess.

Put lemon flavors together.

Put the other flavors together (this also applies to the flavored
vinegars.)

Mixes; 1. Italian parsley, thyme, garlic and oregano. 2. Rosemary and
thyme 3. lemon mix-with garlic

Canola shouldn't emulsify in the fridg.

These are good with stirfry, salads, and drizzled over toasted french
bread.

VINEGARS;

You can let these set out virtually forever.

Use only apple-cider vinegar-it comes only in quart size jars. The
other is flavored and tastes funny.

You can also use wine vinegar.

Stuff the bottle half full with herbs, then fill with vinegar.

Good Mixes; 1. Lovage, tarragon, garlic and chives. 2. Lemon
basil-opal-different variaeties. 3. Marjoram is nice in vinegar.
