This recipe is an adaptation of several of the potatoe chowder
recipes that Lawrence Kellie posted a while back. Some of the the
ingredients also came from the top of my head. It turned out VERY
well, though it does look a little odd.  My husband LOVES it.  I
finally came up with my idea of what Corn/potato chowder should be.
My 3-1/2 year old son's (vegetable hater) only comment as he shoveled
it down was "yummy". I will definately be making this one again. I am
glad I wrote the changes down this time, I usually don't.

This can either be cooked as direced in the recipe, or for about 10
hours in the crock pot, on HI, adding the milk powder and cheese at
the end.

In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat.   Saute onion and celery
until softened but not brown. Add potatoes, Chicken broth, S&P, basil
and carrots. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes
until potatoes are just tender. Brown sliced sausage pieces in a fry
pan, add to chowder.  Add cream of mushroom soup and corn. Simmer
until potatoes and carrots are done to your desired level of
mushiness ( I like em mushy in my chowder). Add grated cheese and
milk powder. If the chowder is too thin, you can remove some of it
and put throught the blender to thicken, if it is too thick, add
water.  Adjust seasonings if desired. Serve with bread or crackers.
