Title: FEUERZANGENBOWLE
Categories: Beverages, Alcohol, German
Yield: 8 Servings
3    Bottles of red wine
1    Piece of orange peel
1    Piece of lemon peel
5    Cloves
1    Small sugar hat
1    Bottle of golden rum
-at least 108 proof
Put orange peel, lemon peel and cloves into a tea filter bag, tie
shut with white yarn. Hang into a copper kettle, pour in wine. Heat
up close to boiling point, but make sure it never gets to boil. Put
the kettle in the middle of your table so all your guests can watch
the ceremony :-). You normally use a "Feuerzange", but as I supect
this might be hard to get outside Europe I guess you can also use a
grid from your barbecue set - especially the ones you normally use to
barbecue herrings in should work pretty well. The point is that you
should be able to put the sugar hat on it (lying on its side) and
place the whole thing safely over the kettle. Once you've got that
far, you're ready for the ceremony. First, dim your lights. Then pour
some rum onto the sugar hat, best using a ladle, and light it (this
is why the rum has to be at least 108 proof). Keep the flames burning
by ladeling more rum on the sugar hat, until the sugar has completely
melted and dripped into the wine. Remove the "Feuerzange" and the bag
with the spices. Serve in heat-proof glasses.

Variation: Many people like to add sugar and/or a little orange juice
(preferably freshly pressed).
