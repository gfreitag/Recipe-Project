"Daliah Organ says that secret to making them fluffy is refrigerating
the for at least 2 hours before shaping them, then cooking them for 1
hour. Her whole family loves them, except Johnny,who likes matzo
balls hard. For him, she removes a few after 1/2 hour of cooking.
Dalian flavors them differently, according to her mood. Instead of
the dill, she sometimes uses 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of sugar
and sometimes uses ground green cardamom seeds. As it has more
flavor, Daliah likes to use chicken fat rather than vegetable oil.
She prefer Streit's matzo meal. The water that she cooks the matzo
balls in is always well seasoned. She serves at least 2 per person."
Combine eggs with chicken fat or oil. In another bowl, combine matzo
meal, salt and dill. Stir 2 mixtures together, Add chicken soup or
water. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. Shape mixture (it
should be like dough) into golf-ball sized balls, moistening hands
with water to prevent sticking. Drop balls into large pot of boiling
water seasoned with salt and pepper. (The more matzo balls you are
cooking the larger the pot should be.) Reduce heat, cover and simmer
1 hour. After cooking, matzo balls should be the size of meatballs.
Remove matzo balls from water and place in chicken soup to absorb
flavor. MAKES: 4-6 SERVINGS
