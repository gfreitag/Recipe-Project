Title: FIDDLEHEAD FERN SOUP
Categories: Maine, Soups & ste
Yield: 4 Servings
4 c  Fiddleheads -- fresh &
Cleaned
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 sm Onion -- minced
2 c  Chicken stock
2 c  Milk or cream
1/2 ts Lemon zest
Salt and pepper -- to taste
Paprika
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the
fiddleheads, return to a boil and cook until they are almost tender
and turn pale green, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
Coarsely chop and reserve. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium
heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until they
become translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the fiddleheads and chicken
stock. Stir, increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a gentle
boil. Cover and cook until the fiddleheads are thoroughly tender,
about 5 minutes. Add the milk, reduce the heat to medium, and heat
until nearly boiling. Do not let the soup boil or the milk will
curdle. Stir in the lemon zest and season the soup to taste with salt
and pepper.  Divide the soup into four bowls, garnish with paprika
and serve immediately.
