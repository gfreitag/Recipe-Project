Title: FIVE CUP BREAD
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Self rising flour
1 c  Dried fruit
1 c  Granola
1 c  Water
1 c  Sugar
NOTES:  Self rising flour can be made by mixing together the
following: 1cup all purpose flour, 1/4 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp
baking soda, and 1/4 tsp salt. (this is used as 1 cup self-rising
flour). For the dried fruit I used dried raisins, apricots, anything
I happen to have on hand, or a mixture of any. The granola can be
Meusli, homemade granola, any high fiber commercial granola, or plain
rolled oats.

Mix all ingredients together (soupy mixture) and put in large loaf
pan.

Bake at 350 for approx. 1 hour.  Serve buttered.
