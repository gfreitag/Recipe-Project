Title: FIRE & ICE TOMATOES
Categories: Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Recipe
6 md Tomatoes, quartered
1 md Onion, sliced
1 md Green pepper, cut in strips
1/4 c  Water
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Celery salt
1 1/2 ts Mustard seeds
1 lg Cucumber, sliced
3/4 c  Cider vinegar
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
1/8 ts Black pepper
In a large bowl combine tomatoes, onion, green pepper, and cucumber.
In a small saucepan combine vinegar, water, sugar, celery salt,
mustard seeds, salt, cayenne pepper and black pepper. Bring to a
boil, boil 1 minute. Pour hot vinegar mixture over tomato mixture.
Cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight to blend flavors. Serve
with slotted spoon.

My note:  This is HOT.  Even Daryl said it was too hot! I think
biting into those mustard seeds really gets ya. I'd cut the cayenne
in half and probably the mustard seeds too. It's very pretty to look
at, and was a nice tomato dish to have in the dead of winter. We
served it with a fairly bland dish made from just some short grain
brown rice and some peas, carrots, and corn thrown in at the end
(frozen).
