roasting pan with a tight fitting cover. Over the brisket place the
following in this order: pepper, worcestershire sauce, onion soup
mix, chili sauce and beer.  Lay carrots in the pan around brisket.
Tear bread into small pieces and tuck under the brisket, so liquid is
covering the bread. Cover and bake in preheated 350 degree oven for
one hour. Reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees and braise another 2
to 2.5 hours or until tender. Remove from oven and let stand until
cool.  Remove meat and slice. Arrange meat slices and carrots on
oven-proof platter; cover with foil. To make gravy: Take the bread,
half the onions and 2 cups liquid from roasting pan. Place in blender
or food processor and process until blended. Return mixture to pan
and blend with remaining liquid. About 1/2 hour before serving,
reheat meat and carrots with half the gravy. Pour remainder in gravy
boat and pass separately.  >From "Cooking in Clover," published by
