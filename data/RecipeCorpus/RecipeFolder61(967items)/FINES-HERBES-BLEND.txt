Title: FINES HERBES BLEND
Categories: Condiments, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Seasonings
Yield: 1 Batch
1 c  Fresh chervil; packed
1/2 c  Fresh chives
1 c  Italian, flat-leaved parsley
-- packed
1/2 c  Fresh tarragon
To prepare fresh herbs after harvesting, remove stems. Wash well, then
spread loosely on paper towels.  Let them stand overnight, changing
paper towels if needed, to completely rid them of any clinging drops
of water.

Place dry herbs in food processor bowl.  Using steel blade, process
on high until herbs are finely chopped. Some herbs may stick under
the blade, so stop several times and stir. Let stand in fine mesh
strainer to dry further.

Yield: About 1 cup.  Keeps in an airtight container in a cool, dark,
dry spot for several months. Use a spoonful to season salad
dressings, sauces, omelets and herb butters. Freeze small amounts for
use in winter soups and stews.
