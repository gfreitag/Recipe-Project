Title: FRAGRANT FRIED RICE
Categories: Grains, Main dish, Side dish
Yield: 2 Servings
1 ts Ground turmeric
1 ts 5-spice
2 tb Sunflower oil
175 g  Long-grain rice, cooked
Salt
Browned pine nuts
-- to garnish
Simplicity itself, the aromatic spicing of turmeric and five-spice
transforms rice both in colour and in flavour. The golden dish is
finally garnished with browned pine nuts, which add their
irresistible crunch to the soft rice.

Simmer the spices in the oil for 2-3 minutes, then add to the drained
rice and toss well. When well mixed together and heated through,
season to taste, separate the grains with a fork and serve garnished
with the browned pine nuts.
