Title: FORCEMEAT STUFFED SPECKLED
Categories: Wildgame, Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Forcemeat, 3-4 lb, speckled
1    Egg white
1/2 c  Heavy cream
3/4 c  Fish, raw
Salt
Paprika
Put fish through meat grinder then pound to a paste in mortar or in
chopping bowl. Work in gradually the unbeaten egg white and add the
seasonings. Press the fish through a sieve and add the cream. This
stuffing is quite rich, but if a plainer one is preferred the same
proportions of raw fish and seasonings are to be used, the fish being
treated as above; then, when pounded to a paste add one-third cup of
soft bread crumbs cooked in five tablespoonfuls of milk. Mix all
thoroughly and bind with one unbeaten egg. Stuff fish and bake in 375
degree oven for 25 minutes or until flaky. Serve with good sauce.
