Title: FISHY FRIES
Categories: Main dish, Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
213 g  Canned pink Alaska salmon
100 g  Plain flour
Salt and pepper; to taste
1 tb Vegetable oil
150 ml Skimmed milk or water
2    Egg whites
Sunflower oil
-(for deep fat frying)
MMMMM--------------------------TO SERVE-------------------------------
Spicy tomato sauce; and/or
Tartar sauce to serve
Drain the can of salmon and flake. Set aside.

Put the flour into a bowl along with the seasoning and vegetable oil.
Gradually beat in the milk or water until smooth and thick.

Whisk the egg whites until they are stiff and fold these into the
batter along with the salmon flakes. Heat the oil for frying in a
deep fat fryer, over a moderate heat. Carefully drop tablespoons of
the salmon batter into the hot oil. (It is better to cook the salmon
fries 4-5 at a time depending on the size of your fryer. Keep the
prepared ones warm in a low oven whilst cooking the rest.)

Turn each salmon fry over after about 45 seconds to brown the other
side. Use plenty of oil for frying as the batter will need to rise
and move about the pan to cook properly. When golden brown all over,
remove from the oil with a slated spoon and drain on absorbent
kitchen paper. Serve the fries hot with tomato sauce or tartar.

Serves 6-8. Approx. 220 kcals per serving
