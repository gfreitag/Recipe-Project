Title: FLAVORED VINEGARS
Categories: New text im, Marinades, Sauces, Salsas
Yield: 1 Servings
Flavorings -- such as
1    Sprig fresh herbs
Peppercorns
Fresh chilies
1    Clove garlic
Vinegar -- such as
White- or red-wine
Cider

Rice-wine vinegar
Vinegars keep for up to a year. Use good-quality red-wine or
white-wine vinegar or cider, sherry, champagne or rice-wine vinegar.
For vinegar containers, I like to recycle attractive bottles. They
must be in excellent condition, free of chips and cracks.

Sterilize the bottles before using: Wash with hot soapy water and
rinse well. Place on a wire rack in a large pot and add water to
cover the bottles; bring to a boil and let boil for 15 minutes.

Transfer the bottles to a clean towel, then use a chopstick or skewer
to poke desired flavorings into sterilized bottles. Experiment with
different combinations and amounts.  Addvinegar to fill, using a
funnel. Seal tightly with clean new corks, plastic stoppers or
screw-on tops. Store in a cool, dry place for at least a week to
allow flavors to blend.Store at room temperature.
