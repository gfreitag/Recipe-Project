milk. Stir in sugar and salt and cool to lukewarm. Dissolve yeast in
warm water. Stir cooled milk mixture into yeast mixture. Add flour
and mix well. Turn out on a floured board and knead until
elastic--about 5 minutes. Place in a greased bowl. Cover and let rise
in a warm place until doubled--about an hour.

While dough is rising, brown hamburger, onion, and celery in a small
amount of oil; stirring so that the hamburger will be crumbly. Pour
off excess fat. Stir in remaining ingredients. Simmer gently 10
minutes.

When dough has doubled, roll out very thin on a floured board. Cut
into 6 envenly sized squares. Divide beef mixture into 6 equal
portions and put 1 portion in the middle of each dough square. Fold
over as for turnovers and seal edges with a fork.

Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and let rise in a warm place
for 30 minutes. Make a small slit in the top of each Foldover. Bake
at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes. Let cool.

When cool spread butter on each cooled Foldover and wrap in foil. If
you make large batches for future Foldovers, now is the time to
freeze them.

At picnic time, put wrapped Foldovers on a grate an heat. Thawed
Foldovers will take 5 minutes per side; frozen Foldovers will take
close to 20 minutes per side.
