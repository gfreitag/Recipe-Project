Chicken flavored coleslaw. A family recipe. The best tasting basic
chicken salad around. Cook chicken gently in simmering water or
stock. Do not boil, this would make tough chicken. Add onions stuck
with cloves. Cook 1-1 1/4 hrs. Pull meat apart in lg chunks. Add
mayo, vinegar, and sugar. Add a drop or two of cold water for
spreading consistency. Assemble sandwich.
