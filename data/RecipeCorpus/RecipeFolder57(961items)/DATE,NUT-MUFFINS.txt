Title: DATE/NUT MUFFINS
Categories: Muffins
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/4 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking soda
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 c  Wheat germ or bran
1/2 c  Chopped dates
1/2 c  Chopped nuts (walnuts)
2 tb Oil
3 tb Molasses
1 c  Apple juice
1 ts Lemon zest
1/4 ts Allspice
Mix flour and leavenings in a large bowl. Stir in bran or germ,
dates, and nuts. Mix remaining ingredients in another bowl until
smooth; add to flour mixture. Stir just to combine. Drop into muffin
cups (makes 12 small ones, less more satisfying larger ones).
Sprinkle rolled Oats on top to look pretty. Bake at 375 degrees for
15-20 minutes.

Non-vegan slightly higher-fat alternative: substitute buttermilk and
and egg for the apple juice.
