Title: CRUNCHY PEANUT CRACKERS
Categories: Bakery, Crackers, Nuts
Yield: 60 Crackers
1 c  All purpose flour
1/3 c  Corn meal
1 c  Roasted, unsalted peanuts
1 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Sugar
3/4 c  Water
1 c  Peanut butter, crunchy
-- smooth
Preheat oven to 350F. In a food processor, combine flour, corn meal,
peanuts, salt & sugar & pulse until the peanuts are finely chopped.
Alternatively, chop the peanuts by hand & mix together with the
flour, corn meal, salt & sugar. In a separate bowl, whisk together
the water & peanut butter until smooth. Add to the flour mixture &
blend to form a cohesive dough. Divide dough into 2 equal portions.
Roll out each portion of dough on a floured surface into a rectangle,
3/16" to 1/4" thick. This dough is very crumbly, so fix any cracks
that occur by pushing the dough back together with your fingers. Cut
the dough into squares (or use a cookie cutter for other shapes)
about 2" across & place on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Prick each
cracker with a fork. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until the crackes are
a deep brown. Cool on a rack. Serve as part of a snack.
