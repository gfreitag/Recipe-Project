CURRIED POTATO CHOWDER: In a large nonstick covered skillet that has
been lightly sprayed with cooking spray, cook onions and garlic over
low heat until onions wilt, about 15 minutes. Stir frequently.
Uncover, stir in sugar, and continue to cook, stirring often, until
onions begin to brown. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan. bring stock to
a boil. Add potatoes, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook unitl
potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes.  Add
onions.  Add wine to skillet; stir to lossen any browned bits.  Add
wine mixture to potato mixture. Return to soup to a simmer. Cook for
another 5 to 10 minutes, until potatoes begin to fall apart and soup
thickens.  Stir in curry powder and dry mustard. Remove soup from
stove; stir in yogurt. Return soup to stove; heat through. Do not
allow to boil. Ladle into hot soup plates; with grated lemon zest and
cucumber slices. ( I would add instant potatoes to make thicker
potato soup) CORN CHOWDER VARIATION: Omit curry powder, dry mustard,
and plain nonfat yogurt.  Chop onion and potatoes into small dice.
Cook as directed until potatoes are just tender. Add corn just before
serving. Garnish with each serving with chopped turkey bacon.
