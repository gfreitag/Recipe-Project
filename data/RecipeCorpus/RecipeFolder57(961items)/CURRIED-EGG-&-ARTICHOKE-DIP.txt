Title: CURRIED EGG & ARTICHOKE DIP
Categories: Vegetarian, Lacto
Yield: 1 Servings
2    To 3 hard boiled eggs
1    (10 oz.?) can unmarinated
(plain) artichoke hearts
x  Mayonnaise
x  Sour cream
x  Cumin powder
x  Curry powder
Chop the eggs and artichoke hearts into chunks big enough to eat and
small enough to scoop up on a cracker. Mix equal parts sour cream and
mayonnaise, enough to make it all moist and tasty, and add spices to
your taste @ 2 parts curry to one part cumin.  I like it spicy
myself, but you don't want to overwhelm the delicate flavour of the
artichoke. Exceedingly popular at parties, and goes quickly; I make a
batch, put it in the refrigerator, and gnosh my way through it in a
day or so!
