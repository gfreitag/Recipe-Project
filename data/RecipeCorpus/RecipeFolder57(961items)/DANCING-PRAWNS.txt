I *think* this came from Sunset Magazine.  There's nothing hot in the
ingredient list, but it would be real easy to put some cayenne or
mashed up chili peppers in the marinade. Probably more authentic as
well.

This attractive Thai presentation looks best with shrimp with their
heads still attached.  Try it with large tiger prawns or fresh
carids. Pound the garlic, shallot, galangal and lemon grass to a
paste in a mortar with a pinch of salt.  Transfer to a shallow bowl
and stir in the lemon juice, soy sauce and wine.

Using a small knife or scissors, split the shrimp shells down the
back, but leave attached.  (If the heads are present, carefully
separate the shell where the tail joins the head, then split the tail
shell open.) Devein if necessary.  Toss in the marinade and let stand
for 30 minutes to 3 hours.

Thread single shrimp lengthwise on skewers, starting at the tail end
and coming out through the head.  Push the skewer on through until
the pointed end extends at least 3 inches beyond the shrimp. Handling
by the pointed ends, grill until the meat is opaque.  To serve, place
the orange or apple cut side down on a plate and insert the pointed
ends of the skewers. Garnish with coriander sprigs and lime wedges.

Serves 4 as an appetizer or side dish.
