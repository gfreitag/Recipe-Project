A mayonnaise base is seasoned with curry, garlic, and Worcestershire
sauce which blend together for an unusual flavor. This dip is always
a smashing success. It's also fabulous as a sauce for cold steak,
pork, or lamb, and divine with cold, poached shrimp! 1. Combine all
ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for
at least 24 hours, allowing the flavors to blend together. (This dip
will keep refrigerated for 2 to 3 weeks.)

2. Present with an assortment of lightly blanched and raw vegetables.

About 2 cups of dip
