Categories: Vegetarian, Low-fat, Soup
Yield: 5 Servings
2 md Butternut squash, or acorn
-squash
2 1/2 c  Water
1 c  Orange juice
1 tb Butter, or oil
1 c  Onion, chopped
2    Cloves garlic, crushed
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cumin
1/2 ts Coriander
1/2 ts Ginger
1/4 ts Dry mustard
1/2 lb Mushroom, sliced
1 ds Cayenne, to taste
Lemon juice, fresh
Yogurt, for the top
1. Preheat oven to 375F Split the squash lenghwise, remove seeds, and
place face-down on a lightly oiled tray. Bake until soft (about 30 to
40 minutes.) Cool, then scoop out the insides. Measure out 3
cups'-worth place this in a food processor or blender with the water,
and puree until smooth. (You may need to do this in batches.)
Transfer to a kettle and stir in the orange juice.

2. Heat the butter or oil in a skillet, and add onion, garlic, salt,
and spices. Saute over medium heat until the onion is very soft -
about 8 minutes. (You may need to add a small amount of water to
prevent sticking.) Add mushrooms, cover, and cook about 10 minutes
over medium heat, stirring occasionally.

3. Add the saute to the squash, scraping the skillet well to salvage
all the good stuff. Add cayenne and heat gently. Once it is hot,
taste it to correct the seasonings. This is a fairly sweet soup; you
may choose to adjust this by adding the fresh lemon juice ..to taste
and topping each bowlful with a small spoonful of yogurt. Recipe by:
