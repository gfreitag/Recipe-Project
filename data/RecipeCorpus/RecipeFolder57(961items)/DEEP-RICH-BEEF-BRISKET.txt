Title: DEEP RICH BEEF BRISKET
Categories: Outdoor, Beef
Yield: 6 Servings
Beef brisket (3-5 lb)
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Pepper
2 tb Peanut or canola oil
1 c  Water
1 ts Instant beef bouillon
2 lg Onions, thinly sliced
2 lg Tomatoes, diced with seeds
.removed (see note)
3    Cloves garlic, crushed
1/4 c  Catsup
2 ts Cornstarch
3 tb Water
Arrange charcoal for indirect cooking (not directly under meat). Place
flour, salt, pepper and paprika in a large zip-lock baggie. Place
meat in bag and shake to coat.  Heat oil in a large skillet and sear
meat until it is browned. Set brisket aside; add water and bring to a
boil. Add bouillon and dissolve. Stir in remaining ingredients
(except cornstarch and 3 tbsp water); mix well and remove from heat.
Place brisket on center of a large piece of tin foil. (Set skillet
aside, you will be using it later on.) Pour bouillon mixture over
both sides of brisket. Wrap brisket tightly with two more sheets of
tin foil turning the wrap 90 degrees after each wrapping. This will
help keep the juices from seeping out.

When coals are white hot throw the brisket on. Cover and cook for
about 2 hours; turning it over after one hour. Add more charcoal as
necessary. Remove from grill and carefully open package without
spilling juices. Pour juices into skillet; recover brisket to keep
warm. Combine cornstarch and water; mix well. Pour into skillet and
heat to boiling to make gravy; stirring constantly. Serve brisket
when gravy has thickened.

NOTE: To remove seeds cut tomato in half. Hold it over the sink and
gently squeeze with your fingers. The pulp and seeds will begin to
loosen and you'll quickly get the hang of it. Rotate tomato half
around with your fingers to completely remove pulp and seeds. Repeat
with remaining half and then dice.
