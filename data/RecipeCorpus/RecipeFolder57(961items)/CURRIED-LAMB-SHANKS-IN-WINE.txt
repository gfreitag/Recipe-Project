Title: CURRIED LAMB SHANKS IN WINE
Categories: Lamb, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 4 Servings
4 tb Oil
4    Lamb shanks
4 tb Flour
1 1/2 ts Curry powder
1 c  Water
1 c  Dry white wine
Salt, garlic salt and pepper
1    Onion slice thinly
I cook lamb occasionally in my Asian recipes, but not often as no one
but myself likes it here.  The main thing to remember about lamb is
that it should be medium rare. Actually, I like it seared on the
outside and nearly raw in the middle, but these days that's not such
a hot idea. Heat oil in a heavy skillet with a tight-fitting lid. Add
shanks and brown slowly on all sides.  Remove shanks form pan. Add
flour and curry powder to drippings and blend well; add water and
wine, stirring, until thickened.

Return shanks to pan, season with salt, garlic salt and pepper. Top
with onions.  Cover and simmer gently for 1 1/2 hours until tender.

Serves 4.
