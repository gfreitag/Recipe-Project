Title: CURRIED PUMPKIN RICE
Categories: Vegetables, Grains
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 c  Rice; long grained
2 tb Butter or
-oil
1    Onion; small - chopped
1 c  Pumpkin; diced -raw
1 ts Curry powder
2 c  -Water
pn -Salt
Heat butter or oil in medium size saucepan, add onions. Cook about 3
minutes till wilted, add pumpkin . Cook another few minutes till
pumpkin softens (about 5 minutes) ; stir in curry. Cook one minute.
Add rice; coat well with onion mixture. Add water and salt; bring to
a boil. Lower heat, cover. Cook gently 15 minutes. Turn heat off,
allow to rest at least 7-10 minutes to absorb water before serving.
Adjust seasonings to taste if necessary. Although I have not tried
it, I assume any firm winter squash could be substituted for the
pumpkin.
