Categories: Meats
Yield: 10 Servings
1    Trimmed beef tenderloin*
*(3-1/2 to 5 lb)
MMMMM---------------------MARINADE AND SAUCE--------------------------
2 c  Soy sauce
2/3 c  Dark sesame oil
6 lg Garlic cloves; chopped
2 tb Fresh chopped ginger
PLACE THE TENDERLOIN in a non-aluminum pan. Mix together the soy
sauce, oil, garlic and ginger, and pour 1/2 of the marinade over the
tenderloin. Reserve the remaining for the sauce. Cover the beef with
plastic wrap and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Remove the
tenderloin from the pan and place it on a charcoal grill over a low
fire, covered, or place in a pan in a 400F oven. Cook until rare (the
internal temperature should be 140F), turning if necessary. Remove
from heat. If cooking in the oven, bring the remaining marinade and
pan juices to the boil and pour over the meat. Serve hot or cold. May
be made ahead and reheated.
