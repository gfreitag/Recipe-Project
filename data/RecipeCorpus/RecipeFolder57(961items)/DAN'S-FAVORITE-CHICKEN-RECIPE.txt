Title: DAN'S FAVORITE CHICKEN RECIPE
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Chicken -- cut up
1    Jar spaghetti sauce
Dried oregano
Garlic salt
1    Crock pot
1    Full working day
1.  Cut chicken into pieces, if needed. 2.  Dump chicken pieces into
crock pot. 3.  Dump 1 jar spaghetti sauce over chicken. 4. Shake
dried oregano and garlic salt (or your other favorite additives to
spaghetti sauce), to taste. 5.  Put lid on crock pot and turn the pot
on LOW. 6. Have a nice day, don't worry, be happy. 7. Come home, fix
a pot of rice or pasta, maybe a salad, and a loaf of french bread. 8.
CAREFULLY remove the chicken from the crock pot to a serving platter
(it's tender and will fall apart at the slightest provocation), then
spoon the leftover liquid into a gravy boat or whatever you serve
spaghetti sauce in. 9. Fight over who gets the top pieces with all
the oregano and garlic salt piled on top.
