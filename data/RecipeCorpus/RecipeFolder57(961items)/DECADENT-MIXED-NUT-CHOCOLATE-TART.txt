5 oz Semisweet baking chocolate
-- chopped
3 tb Powdered sugar, sifted
2 tb Orange-flavored liqueur

2 ts Grated orange zest
3/4 c  Roasted mixed nuts*

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

Heat oven to 450. Line an 8-inch tart pan (removable bottom) with pie
crust dough. Trim outside edge to 3/4 inch from pan; fold crust
inside and press crust firmly against sides of pan. To keep sides
from falling, line crust with aluminum foil and fill with dry rice or
beans. Bake 10 minutes. Remove foil and rice. Prick bottom of crust
with fork; return to oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until edge is light
golden brown. Cool. For chocolate filling, melt chocolate in bowl in
microwave on HIGH for about 2 minutes. Immediately add remaining
ingredients except nuts; whisk until smooth. Reserve 2 tablespoons
filling for glaze. Pour chocolate filling into tart; spread to make
even layer. Gently press whole cracked nuts into chocolate filling
covering entire surface. To glaze tart, whisk enough very hot water
into the reserved filling to make a pourable glaze. Drizzle over
nuts, using the tines of a fork. Refrigerate 1 hour before serving.
