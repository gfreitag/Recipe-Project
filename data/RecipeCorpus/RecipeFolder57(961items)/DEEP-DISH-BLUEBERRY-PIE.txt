Categories: Cooking, Live
For the dough:
Yield: 1 Servings  :
1 1/3 c  All-Purpose Flour
2 TB sugar
1/4 ts salt
1/2 c  Cold Unsalted Butter -- cut
into bits
:
1 lg Egg Yolk, Beaten Lightly
With 1 1/2 Tablespoons Ice
Water
For the filling:
:
:
:
3 TB cornstarch
3 TB rum or water
1 TB fresh lemon juice
2/3 c  sugar
1/4 ts cinnamon
8 c  blueberries -- picked over
An egg wash made by beating
:
1    egg with 2 teaspoons water
1 1/2 TB sugar

Make the dough: In a bowl stir together the flour, the sugar, and the
salt. Add the butter, and blend the mixture until it resembles coarse
meal. Add the yolk mixture, toss the mixture until the liquid is
incorporated, and form the dough into a ball. Dust the dough with
flour and chill it, wrapped in plastic wrap, for 1 hour.

Make the filling: In a large bowl stir together the cornstarch, the
rum, the lemon juice, the sugar, and the cinnamon. Add the
blueberries, and combine the mixture well.

Pour the filling into a 6- to 7-cup gratin dish or other shallow
baking dish. Roll out the dough slightly larger than the dish. Roll
out the dough slightly larger than the dish on a floured surface and
drape it over the filling. Fold the overhang under, pressing the
dough to the edge of the dish, and crimp the edge decoratively. Make
slits and holes in the crust for air vents, brush the crust with the
egg wash, and sprinkle it with the sugar. Bake the pie on a baking
sheet in the middle of a preheated 375 degree F oven for 1 hour to 1
1/4 hours, or until the filling is bubbly and the crust is golden.
Transfer the pie to a rack and let it cool. The pie may be made 1 day
in advance and kept at room temperature.

Yield: 1 pie
