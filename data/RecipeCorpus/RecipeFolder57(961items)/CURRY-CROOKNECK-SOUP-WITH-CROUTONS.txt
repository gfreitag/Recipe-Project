Preheat oven to 325F. Spray a large heavy saucepan with vegetable oil
and place over medium-high heat. Add the sweet potato and onion and
saute for 5 minutes stirring, adding several tablespoons of water to
prevent sticking, if necessary. Add the ginger, squash, stock, and
curry powder. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for
45 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the croutons: Coat the bread slices
generously with vegetable oil spray and place on a baking sheet.
Sprinkle with curry powder and Parmesan. Bake for 2 to5 minutes, or
until crunchy and lightly browned and cut into croutons. In a food
processor or with an immersion, or hand, blender, puree the soup
until smooth. Ladle into individual serving bowls, top with croutons
and sprinkle with chives. [McRecipe:patH 18 Aug 96] Recipe By
