Crisp outsides and chewy centers, are often achieved by undercooking.
In this recipe a small amount of corn syrup is substituted for some
of the granualted sugar, for a chewy texture without being soft or
undercooked. Store cookies in the refrigerator. Mix flour with soda
and salt. Set aside. With an electric mixer, cream the butter until
softened. Add sugar; cream until light and fluffy. Blend in the corn
syrup, scraping down the bowl often. Blend in the lightly beaten
eggs, and vanilla and almond extracts. If the mixture seems curlded
or unhomogenous, add a bit of the flour mixture to bind it. Stir dry
ingredients into creamed mixture, scraping down sides of bowl
occasionally. Stir in chocolate pieces gently by hand. Chill batter
20 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Drop by rounded
teaspoonfuls onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Flatten cookies very
slightly. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 12 minutes, or until cookies are
lightly golden brown. Cool 1 minute on pans, then remove to cooling
rack. Store in the refrigerator to preserve flavors. Yield: 4 dozen.
