Title: CUTTYHUNK PAPRIKA SCALLOPS
Categories: Main dishes, Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 c  Seasoned bread crumbs
1 tb Paprika
1/4 c  Flour
1 3/4 lb Scallops
4 tb Butter
1/2 c  Scallion -- chopped
2 tb Parsley -- chopped
Combine bread crumbs, paprika, and flour in a mixing bowl. Add the
scallops and toss thoroughly to coat. Melt the butter over medium
high heat in a large frying pan. If you do not have a pan large
enough to hold scallops in 1 layer, cook them in 2 batches. Add the
scallops and cook for 5 minutes, stirring gently. Let them brown
nicely, then add the scallions and parsley. Cook for 3 minutes and
serve on hot plates, garnished with lemon slices. The nutty flavor of
short grain brown rice is perfect with this scallop dish.
