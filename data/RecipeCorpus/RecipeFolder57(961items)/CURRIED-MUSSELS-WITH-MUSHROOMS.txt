The photo of this recipe looks wonderful too.  Whole shelled mussels
in a white "curry" sauce along with slices of button mushrooms and
other goodies.  The curry isn't what we would normally think of as a
curry++ there isn't any curry powder called for (though it would
probably be good).

1:  Scrub mussels under cold running water; remove beards. Combine
mussels and water in large saucepan, cover, bring to boil, reduce
heat, simmer for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain mussels,
remove and discard shells; reserve mussels.

2:  Place chillies in small bowl, cover with boiling water, let stand
for 10 minutes; drain and chop chillies. Heat ghee in medium frying
pan, add chillies, ginger, garlic, lemon grass and shallots, stir
over medium heat for about 2 minutes or until shallots are soft.

3:  Stir in coconut milk, sauce and sugar, bring to boil, reduce heat,
simmer, uncovered, for 1 minute. Stir in mushrooms, cook over medium
heat for 1 minute. Blend flour with extra water, stir into mushroom
mixture, stir over high heat until sauce boils and thickens.

4:  Stir in mussels and basil, stir over medium heat until heated
through.

Serves 4.

NOTE:  Recipe is best made just before serving.  This recipe is not
suitable to freeze or microwave.
