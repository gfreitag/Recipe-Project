Title: CRUNCHY CHINESE NOODLES
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 2 Servings
125 g  Egg noodles
2 tb Dark sesame oil
1    2.5cm piece of Root ginger
-- finely grated
1    Garlic clove; crushed
2 tb Soy sauce
3    Spring onions
-- finely sliced
25 g  Pine nuts
-- browned under the grill
Fresh coriander leaves
-- to garnish
The crunch of browned pine nuts gives this simple mixture of egg
noodles, garlic and ginger a mouth-watering texture. The dish is made
in a matter of moments, and a finishing touch of fresh coriander
makes all the difference, adding its distinctively oriental flavour.

Cook the egg noodles in boiling, salted water until soft - about 4-5
minutes. Heat the oil in a wok and soften the ginger and garlic
gently in it for 3-4 minutes, then toss in the noodles until well
coated. Stir in the soy sauce and spring onions and cook for another
3-4 minutes. Finally stir in the pine nuts and mix thoroughly. Serve
immediately, garnished with fresh coriander leaves.
