Title: CURRIED PUMPKIN-APPLE SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 1 Servings
3 tb Olive oil
1    Clove garlic, mashed
1 1/2 c  Chopped onion
1    Large apple, peeled/chopped
1 tb Curry powder
2 c  Pumpkin puree
4 c  Chicken broth
1 c  Milk (I use 2% milk)
Salt and pepper
Heat olive oil in 6 qt. saucepan. Saute garlic, onion and apple. Stir
in curry powder and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add
pumpkin and broth, bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce
heat and simmer about 30 minutes. Puree all in blender or food
processor. Return to saucepan and stir in milk. Season with salt and
pepper to taste. Serves 6-8.

I haven't tried it yet, but I'll bet a chopped carrot could be added
also.
