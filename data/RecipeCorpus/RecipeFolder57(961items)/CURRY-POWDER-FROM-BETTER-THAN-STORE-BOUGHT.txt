dedicated to spices; grind into a powder; store
1/2 cup. Note: Don't make a large amount of powder at once, as the
flavors fade or become acrid if kept too long. This is a mild and
more delicate powder than any
store-bought version; make a small amount at first and adjust to
your own taste. Chuck Ozburn
