I got this recipe from a lady who is now in her 90's and still going
strong. She said this recipe came from the 1920's sometime and was
used in my neck of the woods, out Barkerville way. (a gold rush town
from the 1890's that has been made into a tourist trap) Because there
were so many Chinese that came up to make there fortune, it ended up
being called Chinese Chews, but she swears that the name is Date
Chewsticks.

BEGIN RECIPE::::::::

NOTE:  no margarine or shortening!!!!

Beat eggs and sugar, add baking powder, vanilla, and flour. Add the
dates last and mix thoroughly.  Batter will be thick. Pour into a
greased 8 x 8 pan and bake at 350 for 25 to 30 minutes. When cooled
sprinkle icing sugar over the top and rub in until completely coated
with icing sugar.

Can be doubled and baked in a 9 x 13 pan.  Takes about 10 - 15 minutes
longer.

I have also used that candied fruit that is available at Xmas in
place of the dates and it is wonderful. To make it real fancy for a
"DO", use a paper doily before sprinkling the icing sugar on top.
