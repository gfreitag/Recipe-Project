Sugar
Rosewater
Ginger, ground
Almond Syrup
Maple Syrup
Biscotti
Whipping Cream
Fruit, fresh
Prepare a simple syrup by bringing 2 parts of water and 1 part sugar
to a boil. Remove from heat and add flavoring. Rosewater (to taste)
for a Middle Eastern accent or ground ginger (and use the ginger
biscuits) for a spicier dish or choose almond syrup or maple syrup or
a good shot of brandy. Place as many biscotti as desired in a shallow
bowl or on a plate. Spoon a little of the hot syrup over the
biscotti. You will use approximately 1 Tbsp per cookie.  Let soak for
5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whip some cream. You'll want about 1 Tbsp
per cookie. By the time the cream is whipped, the biscotti should be
softened. Drain off any excess syrup and spoon the cream onto the
soaked cookies. Serve immediately. (Good, too, the next day when it's
soggy). Fresh fruit such as strawberries or cherries are a wonderful
foil against the dessert's sweet richness.
