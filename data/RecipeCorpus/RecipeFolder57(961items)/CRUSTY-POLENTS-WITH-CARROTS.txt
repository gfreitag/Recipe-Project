Categories: New import
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Minced garlic
1/2 c  Minced onion
3 tb Vegetable oil, divided use
1 c  Polent (coarse cornmeal)
3 c  Canned vegetable broth
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1 lb Package fresh baby-cut
Carrots
2 tb Fresh rosemary leaves,
Minced
1 qt Mixed salad greens
Preheat oven to 400 F. In large saucepan, saute garlic and onion in 1
tablespoon oil over medium heat for 1 minute or until garlic and onion
become fragrant. Add broth and bring to a boil.

Simmer, stirring, until very thick and spreadable, about 5 minutes.
Pour into a wide, shallow and oiled baking dish or ovenproof tray,
patting with oiled fingers into an 8-inch square. Sprinkle with
cheese. Bake 20 minutes or until crusty. Keep warm.

Heat remaining oil in large skillet and add carrots, stirring to coat.
Cover an cook over medium heat for 7 minutes, stirring once. Add
rosemary and greens and saute uncovered from 1 to 2 minutes, just
long enough to wilt greens.

Cut polenta in 4 squares and spoon carrots over each square. Makes 4
servings.
