This variation on pancakes uses the yellow puffs of the dandelion, a
good source of Vitamin A. In a bowl mix together flour, baking powder
and salt. In a separate bowl, beat egg, then mix with milk or water
and olive oil. Combine with dry mixture.  Stir in yellow flowers
carefully, taking care not to crush them. Lightly spray a griddle or
frying pan with vegetable oil.  Heat until thoroughly warmed.  Pour
batter onto griddle by spoonfuls and cook like pancakes. Makes 10
fritters.
