according to directions, and let cool. When cool, prick holes in the
tops of the brownies with a fork and pour the coffee liqueur into
them. Let stand.

you can use the low calorie pudding mix (it tastes the same).Break
the candy bars up into very small pieces with a food processor or a
kitchen hammer.

3. Break up half the brownies and place in the bottom of a large
trifle dish or glass bowl. Cover with half the pudding, half the
candy and then half the whipped topping. Repeat layers with remaining
ingredients.

Typists note: To cut the calories, you can use low calorie whipped
top- ping, low calorie brownie mix, low calorie pudding and omit
candy.

Very very good and very very filling.
