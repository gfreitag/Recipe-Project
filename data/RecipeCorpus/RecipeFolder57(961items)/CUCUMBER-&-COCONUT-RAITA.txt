Got some cucumbers languishing in the fridge? Probably won't be after
you see the next four posts...

Raitas or yoghurt salads provide a cool and refreshing contrast to hot
curries in an Indian meal.  However, raitas like this one can also be
used as a dip for crudites or as a light lunch served with naan or
paratha breads.

Peel 500 g cucumber and halve lengthwise. out the seeds and slice the
cucumber finely, about 3 mm thick.

Have ready a large pot of boiling water and bowl of ice-cold water.
Drop the cucumber to the boiling water for 2 minutes, then scoop out
and into the cold water. (Using a deep-fry basket makes this easier.)
Drain the cucumber and dry it thoroughly.

In a bowl, mix 500 mL yoghurt (low fat can used), salt to taste, 1
tablespoon finely chopped parsley, 2 tablespoons of finely chopped
dill, 2 tablespoons of toasted and chopped walnuts or pecan nuts, 1/3
cup of grated fresh coconut (or use dried shredded coconut pre
moistened with about one and a tablespoons of boiling water) and 1
hot chopped finely.

When well blended, stir in the the cucumber.

Heat a tablespoon of oil in a small pan, then add two teaspoons of
black mustard seeds.  When the mustard seeds sizzle and turn grey,
tip seeds and oil into the cucumber mixture and stir well.
Refrigerate for an hour or so to allow the flavours to blend.

Makes 5 or 6 servings.
