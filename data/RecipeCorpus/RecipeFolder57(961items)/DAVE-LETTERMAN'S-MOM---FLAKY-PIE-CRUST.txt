In a medium bowl, cut shortening into flour, sugar, and salt until
the mix looks like cornmeal or small peas. In another bowl, slightly
beat egg yolk and combine with milk and lemon juice. Add to flour
mixture and mix by hand until it forms a ball. Roll on well-floured
pastry cloth with a well-floured rolling pin.

This pastry maintains its flaky qualities even after being rolled out
a number of times.

Makes pastry for one 2-crust pie or two single-crust pies.
