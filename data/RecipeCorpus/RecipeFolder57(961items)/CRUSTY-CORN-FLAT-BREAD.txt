Here's a couple of off beat bread recipes I thought might interest
you. This and the following recipe are wheat free breads.

Combine 1/2 cup of the rice flour, the yeast, sugar and 1/2 cup of
the warm water in a 2-cup glass measure; stir to combine, then let
rest in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 10 minutes.

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and draw two 8-inch
circles on it.

Combine remaining 1/2 cup rice flour, corn flour, cornstarch, xanthan
gum powder and salt in a large bowl; mix to blend.

Beat eggs lightly; set aside 1 tablespoon for brushing tops of
loaves. Add remaining 1 cup warm water and the corn oil to beaten
eggs. Using a wooden spoon, stir egg and yeast mixtures into flour
and beat until smooth. Using a rubber spatula, spread soft dough into
circles on marked parchment paper, heaping it up slightly in the
center.

Cover loaves lightly with greased plastic wrap and let rise until
doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 425F.

Beat a few drops of water into the reserved beaten egg and brush over
loaves.  Dust lightly with rice flour. Using a razor blade, slash
tops of loaves into a large diamond grid pattern. (Use an up-and-down
cutting motion rather than dragging the blade through the soft dough.)

Bake for 20 minutes, until well browned.

Makes two 8-inch diameter, 11-ounce loaves.
