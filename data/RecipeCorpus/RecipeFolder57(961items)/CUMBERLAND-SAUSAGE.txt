Title: CUMBERLAND SAUSAGE
Categories: Pork, British
Yield: 4 Servings
6 oz Pork back fat; minced
1 lb Shoulder of pork; minced
1 oz Stale breadcrumbs
1/2 sl Smoked bacon; minced
Salt
Pepper
Nutmeg
Mace
The pork should be boned and skinned.  Mix the shoulder and the fat.
Add 8 tablespoons hot water to the crumbs. Mix everything together
(use your hands), seasoning well with pepper, and adding a generous
pinch of both the spices.  Fry a spoonful of the sausage to test the
seasoning. Fill the sausage casings as usual. Prick in a few places
and allow to sit overnight before cooking.  ...These are very good
baked in a buttered baking dish at 350F until browned. Turn after 20
minutes, and raise the heat if the sausages are cooking too slowly.
