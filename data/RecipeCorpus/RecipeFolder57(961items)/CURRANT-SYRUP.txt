"This syrup can be refrigerated for about a month, but must be used
within two weeks after a bottle is opened." Add several tbsps to
glass and fill with cold water or sparkling water and ice.

Mash the fruits together and let them stand in a warm place for a day.
Strain the juice into a nonreactive pan, and add 4 cups (1 lite) of
sugar to each 2 1/2 cups (625 ml) of liquid; place over low heat or
inside a pan partly filled with simmering water and stir to dissolve
the sugar. Cool the syrup, then skim it, pour it into bottles and
cork them tightly.
