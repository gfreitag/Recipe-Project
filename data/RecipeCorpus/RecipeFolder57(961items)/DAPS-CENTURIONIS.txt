Title: DAPS CENTURIONIS
Categories: Main dish, Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM------------------ROMULAN LAMB AND LENTILS-----------------------
1    6 to 7 lb leg of lamb
Flour
1    Onion; cut into chunks
Salt and pepper
2 tb Cooking oil
1 c  Onion; chopped
2 c  Lentils
10 oz Beef broth
10 oz Water
1    Bay leaf
1 c  Green onions; sliced
1/2 c  Chopped parsley
1/3 c  Pan gravy for roast lamb
1    Roasting bag
About 4 hours before you want to serve, get the leg of lamb ready and
put it in the oven; Preheat the oven to 350 degrees, dust the inside
of the baking bag with flour, put in the large onion as a layer of
chunks and put the leg of lamb in on top of that. Sprinkle the lamb
with salt and pepper and close the bag. Poke some holes in the top of
the bag. If you wish, stick a meat thermometer into the thickest part
of the roast, right through the bag so you can read the dial: 160 to
190 degrees covers the range from moderately rare to well done. About
40 minutes before serving time, get the lentils going. Heat the oil
in a saucepan and cook the chopped onion until soft and golden. Add
the lentils, beef broth, water, bay leaf, salt and pepper. Simmer for
about 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Fish out the bay
leaf and add the green onions and the parsley. Mix well, and as you
are serving, stir in 1/3 cup of pan gravy from the roast, with as
little fat as possible.
