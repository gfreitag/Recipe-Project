Categories: Vegetables, Vegan
Yield: 3 Servings

150 ml Hot water
1/2 ts Turmeric
1/2    Dried chilli
- soaked in warm water
1/2 ts Cumin seeds

The spiciness of chilli, the flavours of garlic and cumin are the
oriental tastes for this rich and creamy way of cooking cucumber.

Dissolve the creamed coconut in a jug of hot water, and stir in the
turmeric. Fry the chilli, cumin seeds and crushed garlic in the oil
for 2-3 minutes, then toss the prepared cucumber into the pan.
Stir-fry for a minute or so. Pour the coconut milk in and heat
through. Simmer for 5 minutes and it is ready to serve.
