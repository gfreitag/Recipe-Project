Title: CURRY POWDER (SAROJINI MUDNANI'S #1)
Categories: Mix, Indian
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------TO PARCH-------------------------------
2 oz Cummin seed
1 oz Black pepper
6 oz Coriander seed
1/2 oz Fenugreek seed
MMMMM-------------------------UNPARCHED------------------------------
1 oz Cloves
1 oz Cardamom
2 oz Red chilles (hot ones)
2 oz Cinnamon
1 oz Mace
Take the first four ingredients (those headed "To Parch") and roast
in a moderate oven, or parch in a dry frying pan, until a rich aroma
is given off, but taking care not to burn them. Allow to cool before
mixing with the second batch of ingredients.
Put the mixed cooled spices in a grinder (we use an old coffee
grinder) and grind until finely powdered. Pass through a fine sieve,
and if necessary re-grind. Store the mixed spices in a large jar with
an airtight stopper. All spices keep best if stored in a cool dry
dark place. Curry powder, if kept in an airtight jar, improves with
moderate keeping (up to a year or so).
