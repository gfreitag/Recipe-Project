Title: DATE CHUTNEY
Categories: Condiments, Indian, Vegetables
Yield: 3 Cups
8 oz Pitted medjool dates
1/4 ts Red chili powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Cumin powder
3 c  Water
1/2 ts Tamarind paste
This recipe calls for tamarind paste, a sweet-and-sour flavoring made
from the beanlike tamarind fruit.  If you can't find tamarind paste,
add 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup vinegar to dates during cooking.

Place dates in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Cook until
soft and tender, about 25 minutes.  Or cook dates for 15 minutes in a
pressure cooker.  Set cooked dates aside to cool.

Puree dates in small batches in a food processor or blender, adding a
little water as needed to make a smooth paste.

Melt tamarind and spices to pureed dates.  Stir well. Add more water
as needed to make a thick sauce.
