The Cholesterol-Saturated Fat Index: "In order to make it easier for
people to select foods that are low in BOTH cholesterol and saturated
fats, we have devised a Cholesterol-Saturated FAt Index(CSI). The CSI
enables you to grasp the contribution of both saturated fat AND
cholesterol in one food compared to another. The CSI reflects our
findings that the amount of saturated fat in the diet is just as
important as the amount of cholesterol in terms of dietary control of
the cholesterol and LDL in the blood.
The lower the CSI number, the better the food choice for the
prevention of heart disease(and the other disorders.....).
The New American Diet bySonja L. Connor,M.S.,R.D and William E.
Connor,M.D. I recomend very highly that you purchase and read the
Connor's book. Besides the recipes which are included in this DB the
book is filled with the latest research on degenerative diseases and
diet.
