Title: DAN'S CREAMY CHICKEN & PASTA
Categories: Pasta, Poultry, Chicken, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Thin spaghetti (dry)
2 qt Chicken broth
3/4 c  Sliced celery
3/4 c  Slivered onions
1 c  Cooked chicken, diced into
Bite-sized pieces
4 tb Butter (up to 8 tb can be
Used for a richer product)
3 tb Grated parm or romano cheese
1 c  Milk
2 tb Flour
Salt and Pepper to taste
1)  Bring the broth to a boil in a large pan.  While it is coming up
to the boil, add the celery, onion and chicken.

2)  Break the thin spaghetti into smaller pieces, about 3 or 4 inches
in length.  Drop them into the boiling broth.

3)  Cook the spaghetti until done.  Most of the broth will be
absorbed by the pasta.  If it gets too dry add a little water.

4)  In a small bowl, wisk together the milk and the flour until the
flour is completely incorporated.  Pour it into the boiling spaghetti
pot and stir to completely mix.

5)  As soon as the sauce has thickened, shut off the heat and
immediately add the grated cheese.

6)  Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper according to taste.
This tasting is very important because some of the initial broth
which you used will have varying amounts of salt.  I happened to use
a homemade broth which had a little salt in it and I needed to add
salt. If you use a canned broth, it will probably not require as much
salt as most canned broths have plenty to begin with.
