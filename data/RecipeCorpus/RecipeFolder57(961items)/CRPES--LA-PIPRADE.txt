Categories: Main dish, Cheese/eggs, Brunch
Yield: 3 Servings
MMMMM-----------------FOR 9-10 CM (4 IN) CRPES----------------------
40 g  Flour
1    Egg
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Vegetable oil
50 ml Milk
MMMMM----------------------PIPRADE MIXTURE---------------------------
175 g  Onions; finely sliced
2 tb Vegetable oil
175 g  Green pepper
-- de-seeded and sliced
2    Ripe tomatoes
-- skinned and chopped
2    Garlic cloves; crushed
1 tb Parsley, chopped
1 tb Fresh basil leaves, chopped
50 g  Gruyre cheese
-- diced very small
Salt and pepper
These little crpes are made with a French country recipe for onions,
peppers and tomatoes cooked with garlic, basil and parsley. The
piprade mixture is folded into the pancake batter and the crpes are
cooked until golden. Lovely with a tossed green salad.

Blend the ingredients for the crpe batter together and allow to rest
for an hour.

Cook the onions gently in the oil for about 10 minutes, covered,
stirring occasionally until soft and sweet. Add the sliced peppers
and cook for a further 5 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes and garlic
and cover the pan for several minutes, until the mixture is well
reduced. Continue to cook over a slightly raised heat for 5 minutes,
adding the herbs and stirring the mixture thoroughly. Season to
taste. Add the cheese to the piprade mixture and stir into the crpe
batter. Fry in a hot pan with a little oil, as for ordinary crpes,
turning so that they cook until golden on both sides.
