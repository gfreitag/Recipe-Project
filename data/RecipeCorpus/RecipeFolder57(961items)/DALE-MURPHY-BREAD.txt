This savory bread is filled with meat, cheese, herbs and olives and is
perfect for a trip to the ball park. It was named for Dale Murphy, a
former player for the Atlanta Braves.

IN FOOD PROCESSOR OR mixing bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups of the bread
flour, yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water, butter and egg to the
yeast mixture. Process or knead, adding enough flour in 1/2-cup
increments, to make a soft dough. Knead until elastic and smooth, 1
minute in a food processor or 10 minutes in a mixer or by hand. Place
in oiled plastic bag or turn in greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap
and let rest 15 minutes or, if you have time, let it double. On a
lightly floured board, roll the dough to a 14-by-10-inch rectangle.
Place on a greased baking sheet. Spread pesto sauce down the center
third of dough, lengthwise. Dot with olives, mozzarella and
Garlic-and-Herb Cheese. Top with ham strips and sprinkle with peppers
and sun-dried tomatoes.

TO ENCASE FILLING, cut the unfilled dough diagonally on each side to
1-inch strips down the length of each side of the dough. Criss-cross
the strips, bringing one strip over the center from one side, then a
strip from the other, until the length of the filling is encased with
the overlapping strips. Let double, uncovered, in a warm place for
half hour. Preheat oven to 400F. Combine egg and water and brush the
glaze on the loaf. Bake until done, about 25 minutes. Remove from pan
and cool on wire rack before slicing. Serve warm or at room
temperature.

HOMEMADE GARLIC AND HERB CHEESE: Blend the cream cheese, butter and
garlic in a food processor until smooth. Add the herbs and combine.
Salt and pepper to taste. Can be made one week ahead, covered
tightly, and refrigerated. Makes about 2 1/2 to 3 cups.
