Title: DAL (LAUREL'S KITCHEN)
Categories: Digest, Oct.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Yellow or green split peas
1 ts Salt
1    Onion
1/2    Green pepper
1 ts Tumeric
1/2 ts Curry powder
1 1/2 ts Black mustard seeds
1    Lemon juiced
Boil the yellow split peas in 2 cups water for about 30
minutes--until they are tender but not so long that they lose their
shape. They should be rather dry, like mashed potatoes, but keep an
eye on them. You may need to add a little more water along the way.
Stir in salt. While the peas are cooking chop onion and green pepper.
Combine with tumeric and curry powder and set aside.

Heat up a heavy pan with a lid.  When it is very hot, add mustard
seed and cover.  The seeds will pop noisily; shake the pan during
this process to make sure they don't burn. (Traditionally, you do the
seed popping in oil. It works without, but you need to be ready to
add the next ingredients quickly.)  When the sound quiets down, add
the onion mixture and a little water for saute.  Saute until onion is
transparent and golden, and then stir this mixture into the peas
along with the lemon juice. Serve with Chapatis (Indian bread) or
over basmati rice, or whatever creative way you feel like doing.

Makes about 4 cups.

NOTE: I realize mustard seed is high fat ingredient, but it adds so
much to the flavor, and so little fat over all, I kept it in. The
recipe will work without it, though it's not quite the same.

(well, no added fat)
