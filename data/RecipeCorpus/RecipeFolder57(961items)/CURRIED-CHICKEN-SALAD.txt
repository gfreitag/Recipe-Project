Preheat oven to 350.  Lay chicken on a rimmed baking sheet and cover
tightly with foil.  Bake fo 20-25 minutes until cooked through but
still moist and juicy.  Cool to room temp.  Cut into bite-size
pieces. Combine with celery, pineapple, raisins and nuts.  (It is
best to add pineapple just before serving, because it it sits with
the chicken for more than a few hours, the acid will turn the chicken
mushy.) Serve on greens, or in pita bread, or on melon rounds.
