1/4    Stick butter or margarine

spoon. Cut each half into 4 strips and each strip into 2 inch pieces.
Place in a glass bowl and sprinkle with vinegar, salt and sugar;
toss. Marinate at least 2 hours in refrigerator (longer time for more
sour taste). Drain and pat dry with towel. Saute onions in butter
until tender, but not brown. Increase heat and add cucumbers,
stirring and cooking until crisp tender. Add cream and continue to
cook until cream is reduced slightly and coats the cucumbers.  Remove
from heat and garnish with chopped parsley. Serve immediately.
