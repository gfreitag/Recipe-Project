1/2 c  Flour
1    Egg, slightly beaten
1 ts Curry powder
1/2 lb Carrots, scraped and coar
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Flat beer
1    Egg white
Combine flour, salt, egg, 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and beer to
make a smooth batter.  Cover with plastic wrap for several hours at
room temperature, the longer the better. (It can also be refrigerated

oil doesn't need to be more than one inch deep for this. Remove
fritters with slotted spoon, and let them drain on paper towels.
