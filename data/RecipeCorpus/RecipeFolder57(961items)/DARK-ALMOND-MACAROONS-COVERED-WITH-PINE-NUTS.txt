Preheat oven to 350, place the oven racks into the middle of the oven
and line one or two sheet pans with foil.

In a food processor grind the almonds fine using a pulsing action.
Add the sugar and process until blended. Remove to a mixing bowl and
stir in the vanilla, honey and egg whites.

Place the pine nuts on a plate.  Drop the batter in heapin table
spoons into the pine nuts and roll gently to cover each cookie with
pine nuts. After roling, the cookies should be shaped like short logs.

Place on the lined pans about two inches apart.  Bake in a preheated
oven for 18 minutes until golden brown on top and wel browned on the
bottom. If baking two sheets at a time, switch them top to bottom
halfway through baking.

the foil off the still warm cookies and cool completely.

NOTES : Very distinctive, thse macroons are not too sweet, but are
crunchy and chewy and rich with the exotic flavor of toasted pine
nuts.
