Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
400 ml Custard apple flesh
200 ml Cream
100 g  Caster sugar
Delicate in flavour, this ice-cream originates in the Caribbean. It
could hardly be simpler to make.

Puree 400 mL of custard apple flesh (you will need 2 medium to large
custard apples). Add 200 mL cream and 100 g caster sugar Stir well
then stir again from time to time until the sugar has dissolved. Pour
into an ice-cream maker and freeze. Or if you don't own this
appliance, pour the mixture into a metal freezing tray(s) and freeze,
stirring with a fork from time to time as an icy mush forms at the
edges.

When the whole mixture is a mush remove from the fridge, beat well and
freeze again until required. Soften in the body of the fridge for
15-20 minutes before serving.
