Prepare pasta according to package directions. While pasta is
cooking, heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the
onion, scallions, garlic and jalapeno pepper. Saute until the onion
is wilted and begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Stir in the curry
powder and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato and soy sauce, reduce
the heat to low and cook until the tomato begins to give off liquid.
Stir in the vegetables and cook 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.

Just before draining the pasta, stir 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid
into the curry mixture. Return the skillet to low heat and cook until
heated through.

Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Add the curry mixture and
stir well to coat the pasta with sauce. Add honey and raisins. Stir
well. Serve at once, passing the lime wedges separately.
