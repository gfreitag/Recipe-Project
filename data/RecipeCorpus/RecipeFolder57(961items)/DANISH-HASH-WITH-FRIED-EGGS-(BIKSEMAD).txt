Fat grams    per serving:
:45 In a wide frying pan over medium heat, melt 3 tablespoons of
butter. Add onions and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until they
are limp and golden (about 15 minutes). When onions are cooked,
transfer to another container and keep warm. Then, in the same frying
pan over medium-high heat, melt 3 tablespoons more of the butter and
cook potatoes, turning as needed to brown on all sides; add to onions
and keep warm. Add 1 tablespoon more butter to the pan and cook beef,
stirring occasionally, until it is browned and heated through. Add
beef to container with onions and potatoes; keep warm. Again using
the same frying pan add broth, Worcestershire, salt, and pepper. Cook
over high heat until reduced by about half; then pour over hash
mixture. Mix lightly but thoroughly. Using the same pan, melt 1 to 2
tablespoons butter and fry eggs until done as desired. Spoon hash
onto a warm platter and arrange eggs on top. Garnish with the lettuce
and tomatoes. Serve with coarse salt, if you wish. Makes 4 to 6
servings. Biksemad (bick-sa-mod) is the Danish name of this delicious
beef and potatoe hash. It makes a delightful entree for a casual
supper or brunch. From the "Sunset Scandinavian Cook Book", published
