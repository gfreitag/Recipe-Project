Title: CURRIED VIDALIA ONION FRITTERS
Categories: Side dish, Mine
Yield: 20 Fritters
1 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder
2 ts Curry powder
1 ts Salt
1    Egg
1 ds Vinegar
A few dashes hot sauce
1 lg Vidalia onion, peeled
-halved, thinly sliced
Vegetable oil for frying
Mix all the dry ingredients together in a bowl.

Beat the liquids together. Pour over the dry ingredients and combine.
Add the sliced onions and mix well. If possible, let stand for 1 hour.

In a large saucepan or deep skillet heat 3 inches of vegetable oil to
350F over medium heat.

Drop the batter into the hot oil by tablespoonfuls, being careful not
to crowd the pan. Cook until browned on one side and turn. When the
fritters are deep golden brown all over, remove them and drain on
paper towels. Break one open to test for doneness; if underdone in
the center, reduce the heat a bit, and fry another minute. Repeat
until all the batter is used up and serve immediately.
