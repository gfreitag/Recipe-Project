To make the chocolate mousse:  bring the cream to the boil. Squeeze
the gelatine leaves to remove excess water and add to the cream with
the chocolate.  Remove from the heat and stir constantly until the
chocolate and gelatine have dissolved.  Set aside to cool. When the
chocolate cream is cool, fold through the whipped cream and set
aside. To make the chocolate sponge: beat the eggs with the sugar
until pale and thick and carefully fold in the sifted flour and
cocoa. Line a 20x30cm baking sheet with baking paper and spread the
mixture onto the paper to a thickness of 1cm.  Bake in a preheated
200c oven for about 10 mins, then remove and set aside to cool. To
make the orange confit sauce: melt the sugar in a saucepan with the
lemon juice and cook until the mixture forms a golden caramel. Remove
from the heat and carefully pour the orange juice on to the caramel
and stir to combine. Remove from the heat, stir through the orange
zest and set aside to cool. To assemble the torte: spread a 2cm thick
layer of mousse onto the chocolate sponge, cover and refrigerate
until set. To serve:  cut the torte into triangular slices, place on
a serving plate and dust with cocoa.  Spoon around some orange confit
sauce, arrange a triangle of chocolate on top and serve with segments
of orange. Typed for you by Sherree Johansson.
