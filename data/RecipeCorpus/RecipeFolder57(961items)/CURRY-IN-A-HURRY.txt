Title: CURRY IN A HURRY
Categories: Indian, Curry
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Shrimp or boneless, skinless
-chicken breasts
2 1/2 tb Oil
1 1/2 ts Curry powder
1/4 ts Red chili powder or
-cayenne pepper
1 ts Crushed garlic
1 cn Crushed or whole skinless
-tomatoes, chopped (1 lb)
1 ts Crushed ginger (opt)
Salt to taste
1 tb Heavy cream (opt)
1/4 c  Fresh chopped coriander
1/2 ts Lemon juice
If using shrimp, clean and devein. Saute them lightly on both sides
until they become pinkish, then set aside. If using chicken, cut the
meat into 1" strips and set aside. In a saucepan or wok, heat the oil
and "splutter fry" the curry powder and red chili powder and then the
garlic rapidly for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, then add the ginger,
if desired, and salt; mix well and bring to a boil. Add the chicken
or shrimp, and simmer until cooked (3-5 minutes for the shrimp, 6-10
minutes for the chicken). Finally, do the "fimmering" process,
simmering on high heat until the oil floats to the top for a minute
or so. Remember that overcooking or overspicing can kill the curry.
Use the optional cream to tame the curry or adjust the flavor.
Garnish with freshly chopped coriander and a squeeze of lemon juice.
Serves 2 as a main dish, 3-4 when served with other dishes.
