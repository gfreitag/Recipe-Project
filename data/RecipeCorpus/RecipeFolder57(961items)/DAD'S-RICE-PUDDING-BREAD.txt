Note just above the recipe says that this bread was inspired by fond
memories of Linda's Dad sitting at the table pouring milk over his
rice and putting cinnamon & sugar on top. Also notes to watch dough
ball as it varies each time you make it and that if you use freshly
cooked rice you will need to add extra liquid. 1. Place all
ingredients except raisins in bread pan, using the least amount of
liquid listed in the recipe. Select Light Crust setting and
Raisin/Nut cycle. Press start. 2. Observe the dough as it kneads.
After 5 to 10 minutes, if it appears dry & stiff or if your machine
sounds as if it's straining to knead it, add more liquid 1 tbsp. at a
time until dough forms a smooth, soft, pliable ball that is slightly
tacky to the touch. 3.  At the beep, add the raisins. 4. After the
baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake rack, & allow
to cool 1 hour before slicing. CRUST: Light -- BAKE CYCLE: Raisin/nut
~- OPTIONAL BAKE CYCLES: Standard, Whole Wheat, Sweet Bread..
