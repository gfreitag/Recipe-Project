Title: CUCUMBER SOUP WITH PISTOU
Categories: Vegetables, Soups
Yield: 6 Servings
1 tb Olive oil
1    Leek (white part plus 1 inch
-of green) chopped
1    Stalk celery with leaves,
-chopped
1 lb Cucumbers, peeled, halved,
-seeded, and chopped
2 ts Lemon juice
4 c  Chicken stock
Pistou:
2    Cloves garlic, finely minced
1/4 c  Minced fresh basil
4 ts Finely chopped walnuts
2 ts Parmesan cheese
4 ts Olive oil
1/2 md Sized tomato, peeled,
-seeded, and chopped
To prepare the soup: In a medium-size saucepan, heat oil over low
heat. Add leeks and celery and cook until vegetables are soft, about
10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add cucumbers, lemon juice and
stock. Bring to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce heat to low and
simmer for 20 minutes, or until cucumbers are tender. Cool slightly.
To prepare Pistou: With a mortar and pestle, mash together garlic,
basil and walnuts to a paste. (you can also use a bowl with a wooden
spoon). Work in a little cheese and oil and one-third of the tomato.
Keep adding cheese, oil and tomato. The mixture will not be a true
emulsion but a barely fluid paste.

Transfer cucumber mixture to a food processor or blender and puree, in
batches, until smooth.  Ladle soup into serving bowl. Pass the pistou.
Allow 1 tablespoon of pistou per serving to be placed in the center
of the bowl, then swirl into soup.
