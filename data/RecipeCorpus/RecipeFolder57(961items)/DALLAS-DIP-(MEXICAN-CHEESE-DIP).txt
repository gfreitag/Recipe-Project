Title: DALLAS DIP (MEXICAN CHEESE DIP)
Categories: Dips
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Hamburger
1 md Onion -- chopped
1 sm Green pepper -- chopped
1 sm Can
(mild or hot)
16 oz Can
1/2    Stick margarine
2 lb Box
Chopped green chilies --
Chopped tomatoes
Velvetta cheese -- cubed
Cook hamburger, onion and green pepper until hamburger is done. Drain
well. Add green chilies, tomatoes, cheese and 1/2 stick margarine.
Cook until all the cheese is melted. Serve with tortilla chips. I
like this best when it has cooled just slightly because it thickens.
This recipe will make about 2 1/2 quarts but it freezes really well
and heats up good in the microwave.
