Title: CRYSTALLIZED VIOLETS
Categories: Flowers, Candies, Holiday, Info/tips
Yield: 1 Servings
1 tb Powdered gum arabic
1 tb Rose water
Violet blooms
Superfine sugar
NOTE: Both gum arabic and rose water are available from drugstores or
cake decorating supply stores.

Dissolve the gum arabic in the rose water and leave until the solution
becomes a paste.  Using a small brush, paint each violet all over
with the solution, then dip the flowers in superfine sugar. Leave to
dry on a wire rack in a warm place.  Store the petals in an airtight
container, and use them on desserts as an edible garnish.
