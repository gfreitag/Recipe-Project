Title: CRYSTALLISED CHESTNUTS
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
500 g  Chestnuts
1 c  Sugar
1    Stick cinnamon, 5 cm long
1/2 c  Water
1 1/2 tb Rum
These titbits are good with strong coffee to round off a meal.

Simmer 500 g peeled chestnuts in water for 20 minutes or until soft.
Do not stir in case the chestnuts break up. When they are cooked,
remove them gently from the water to a colander, using a slotted
spoon.

In a saucepan boil together without stirring 1 cup sugar, a 5 cm
stick of cinnamon and half a cup of water, until a drop forms a soft
ball in cold water. Skim the surface, cool, and add 1.5 tablespoons
rum and the chestnuts. Stir mixture gently with a wooden spoon until
it becomes creamy. Pour onto a greased platter and separate chestnuts
with a spoon.
