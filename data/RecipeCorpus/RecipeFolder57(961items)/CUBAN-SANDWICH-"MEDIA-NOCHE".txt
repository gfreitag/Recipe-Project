Title: CUBAN SANDWICH "MEDIA NOCHE"
Categories: Sandwiches
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Cuban Roll
2 ts Mayonnaise
2 ts Dijon mustard
2 oz Roast Pork
2 oz Ham, cooked
1 oz Swiss cheese
3    Tomato slices
1    Iceberg lettuce leaves
3 sl Dill pickle
1 tb Butter
Slice open the roll lengthwise.  Spread the bottom with mayonnaise,
the top with the mustard.  Layer the sandwich with the pork, ham,
cheese, tomato, lettuce, and pickle.  Cover with the top of the roll.

Lightly butter the entire outside of the sandwich.  Place in a
skillet over medium heat.  Place a weight, like a bacon press, on
top, or flatten the sandwich with a long spatula.

Cook the sandwich until crusty and golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3
minutes per side, adding butter as necessary.  Slice the sandwich in
half on the diagonal and serve at once.
