Stem, seed, and dice peppers.  [Scotch Bonnets can be substituted for
the Habaneros.]  Dice onions and tomatoes. Mix in all other
ingredients and chill (overnight is best) until the flavors blend.

Serve with tortilla chips.  Not for the heat intolerant! WARNING: You
may want to use gloves to handle the peppers, ESPECIALLY the
Habaneros.

* Hot Pepper Vinegar:

A home-bottled, *HOT* pepper vinegar is the best choice. If that is
not available, a commercially bottled vinegar can be substituted. You
can, however, easily bottle your own pepper vinegar to control the
heat and flavor content.

[See recipe] Dat'l Do-It Hot Pepper Vinegar is also great substitute.
However, it comes in very small bottles. Since we were continually
"topping it off," we decided to mix it in quantity. Add seven bottles
of Dat'l vinegar, peppers and all, to approximately 3/4 gallon of
white vinegar, and allow to steep for a week before using. The
quantities specified are actually more diluted than the original
product, so you may choose to use the original formula directly.
