Categories:
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
3/4 c  Yellow cornmeal
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
2    Eggs
3 tb Butter -- melted
3 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Milk
1 1/2 tb White vinegar
1 c  Heavy cream
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter an 8-inch square baking dish,
and place it in the hot oven while you prepare the batter. Sift or
stir together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder and baking soda. In
a mixing bowl, beat the eggs and the melted butter until
well-blended. Add the sugar, salt, milk and vinegar and beat well.
Stir the dry ingredients into the egg mixture just until the batter
is smooth. Pour the batter into the heated dish. Pour the heavy cream
into the center of the batter. Do not stir. Check the cornbread after
45 minutes. It is done when the top becomes lightly browned. Serve
warm. Yield: 1 8-inch square loaf
