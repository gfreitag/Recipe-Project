Title: DEB'S ZABAGLIONE
Categories: Desserts, Eggs, Dkuhnen msn
Yield: 2 Servings
4 lg Egg yolks
3 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Marsala Wine
On top of a double boiler or bain-marie, whisk the egg yolks and sugar
until dissolved.  (I use an electric hand mixer) Add the marsala
slowly, while whisking constantly. Continue to whisk until the
mixture is thick and VERY fluffy.  Serve warm in a pretty long
stemmed glass. This can also be served as a sauce on top of fruit and
or angel food cake.
