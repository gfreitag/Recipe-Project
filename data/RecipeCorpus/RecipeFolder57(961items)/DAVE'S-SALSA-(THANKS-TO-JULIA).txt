Here's my favourite salsa recipe. Quick to make, and delicious. As
with most recipes of this type, the quantities are variable according
to personal taste, but this is what I like...

Drain a little of the juice out of the tomatoes (otherwise it gets a
little too runny), and then mix all of the ingredients together. The
number of chiles depends very much on personal taste, and on the type
available (here in the UK we get a much more limited range on sale),
but I'm sure you can all figure out just how hot you want to make it.

If possible, leave it to stand for at least half an hour before
eating, or even overnight, but I can rarely wait that long before
getting the munchies.

How to eat: well, anyway you like. My favourite is to make a big bowl
of salsa, take a big bag of tortilla chips, and then to while away
the evening on the sofa dunking one into the other.
