Title: CURRIED HAM & TURKEY (USDA)
Categories: Freezes wel, Usda
Yield: 24 Servings
1/2 c  Butter, margarine -- or
Turkey fat
1 c  Unsifted flour
2 1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1 1/2 ts Curry powder
4 ts Sweet pepper flakes
1 tb Instant miced onions
2 1/4 qt Hot milk
1 1/4 lb Cooked turkey -- diced (4
Cups)
3/4 lb Cooked ham -- diced (2
Cups)
Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
served without freezing.

Melt fat.  Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and curry powder. Add pepper
flakes and onion. Stir in milk slowly. Cook until thickened, stirring
constantly. Stir in turkey and ham.

TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Heat to serving temperature after turkey
and ham are stirred into hot mixture. Serve over hot toast or
biscuits.

TO FREEZE:  Pour each fourth of the mixture to be frozen into a
baking pan. Pack food tightly to avoid air pockets. Cool for 30
minutes at room temperature. Complete wrapping by pulling paper up
over top of food. Put edges of wrap together and fold several times
so paper lies directly on top of food.  Fold ends of freezer wrap
over the top and seal with freezer tape.  Label with name of food,
date of freezing, and last date the food should be used for best
eating quality (about 6 months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12
hours before removing packages from the pans.

TO HEAT FROZEN CURRY:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Remove
freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. Bake 1 hour or until mixture
is bubbly at edges. Stir occasionally during heating. After heating,
stir gently until sauce is smooth.  Serve over hot toast or biscuits.
