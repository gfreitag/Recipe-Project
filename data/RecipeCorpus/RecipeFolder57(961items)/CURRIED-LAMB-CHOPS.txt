-the rack, about 2 lbs
Salt and freshly ground
-pepper to taste
1 tb Curry powder
1 tb Peanut oil

Lamb is one of the greatly under-utilized meats here in the US, I
think. There are a variety of recipes from around the world to
inspire you. Actually, I was looking for my Mongolian lamb recipe but
don't have it typed in (just use any ol' Mongolian beef recipe and
substitute lamb for the beef and don't over cook it).

Sprinkle the chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Rub them on
both sides with curry powder to coat evenly.

Heat oil in a skillet large enough to hold the chops in one layer.
Add the chops and cook until browned on one side, about 2 minutes.
Turn and brown on second side, about 2 minutes. Turn onto the fatty
rims and continue cooking until the rims are rendered of fat, about 2
minutes.

Turn the chops flat side down and cook, turning them occasionally. The
total cooking time should be about 15 minutes. Transfer the chops to
a dish and pour off all the fat from the skillet.

Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to the skillet and heat. Add the
shallots and cook, stirring, about 15 seconds. Add the wine and bring
to a boil. Cook for about 1 minute and then add the chicken broth and
tomato paste. Cook over moderately high heat until reduced to about
1/3 cup. Swirl in the remaining butter and pour the sauce over the
chops. Serve sprinkled with parsley.

Serves 4.
