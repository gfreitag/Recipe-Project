Title: DATE & ORANGE CHUTNEY
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 Recipe
1 lb Untreated oranges
3 1/2 c  Sugar
7 tb Golden syrup
2 tb Coarse salt
1/4 ts Dried chilies; crushed
6 3/4 c  Malt vinegar
1 lb Onions; chopped
1 lb Dates; stoned and chopped
1 lb Raisins
Grate the orange zest and set aside.  Remove the pith from the
oranges and discard the seeds.  Finely chop the orange flesh. In a
large, stainless steel saucepan, combine the sugar, syrup, salt,
chilies, and vinegar. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring to
dissolve the sugar. Add the oranges, onions, dates, raisins, and half
the grated zest. Reduce the heat and simmer until thick, about 1
hour. Stir in the remaining orange zest. Spoon into warm, sterilized
jars. Leave to cool, then seal. Store in a cool, dark place.
