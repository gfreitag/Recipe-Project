2 tb LIGHT CORN SYRUP 2 ts VANILLA EXTRACT Make the dark chocolate
mousse: Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9 1/4-by-5 1/4-by-2
3/4-inch metal loaf pan. Line the pan with plastic wrap so that the
plastic extends about 1 inch beyond the rim of the pan. Place the
chocolate in a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade.
Process for 30 to 45 seconds, until finely chopped. In a small
saucepan, combine the milk, sugar and salt. Cook over medium heat,
stirring with a wooden spoon, until the sugar dissolves and the
mixture comes to a gentle boil. With the motor of the food processor
running, pour the hot milk mixture through the feed tube. Process for
15 to 25 seconds, until the chocolate is completely melted. Scrape
down the sides of the work bowl. Add the oil, rum and vanilla and
process for 15 to 25 seconds, until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
Scrape the chocolate mixture into a large bowl. Let the chocolate
mixture stand for a few minutes, until tepid. In the chilled 4
1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the wire whip
attachment, whip the cream at medium-high speed until soft mounds
barely start to form and the cream is still pourable. Do not overwhip
the cream. Using a large rubber spatula, gently fold one-third of the
whipped cream into the tepid chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in
the remaining whipped cream. Do not overfold the mousse, or it will
become grainy. Scrape the chocolate mousse into the prepared loaf pan
and smooth the top with the rubber spatula. Wrap the loaf pan in
plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Freeze the terrine for at least 6
hours or overnight, until firm. (The terrine can be prepared ahead to
this point and kept frozen for up to 1 month. ) Continued.......
