Title: CURRY CHICKEN WITH GRAPES
Categories: Poultry, Salads
Yield: 8 Servings
8    Chicken breast
-halves (boned)
6 c  Grapes, seedless
-(or less; vary amount
-to taste)
2 c  Mayonnaise
4 ts Curry powder
3 ts Olive oil
1 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Black pepper, ground
1 ts Fruit vinegar
Make the sauce by mixing together all ingredients except the chicken
and the grapes. Season to taste (sample by dipping a grape into the
sauce and then eating it).

Broil the chicken breasts (3-5 minutes on each side in a preheated
broiler), then dice or shred into small bite-sized pieces.

Mix chopped chicken with about 2 cups of whole grapes. Cover with the
sauce. Add more grapes to taste. My taste is to add vast quantities of
grapes.

NOTES:

*  Chicken fruit salad curry -- One day I was invited to a beach
picnic, and asked to bring a salad. A friend and I got together in
his kitchen and concocted a curried chicken salad with grapes. It was
delicious, but we forgot to write down the recipe. After some more
experimentation, I have come up with this recipe. I don't know if it
is the same as what we made that day at the beach, but it is
delicious.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes including cooking the chicken.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
