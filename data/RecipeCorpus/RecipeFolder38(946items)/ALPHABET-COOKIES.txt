Categories: Desserts, Cookies
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 ea STICKS BUTTER OR MARGARINE
3/4 c  SUGAR
1 ea EGG
1/2 ts VANILLA OR ALMOND
1 x  EXTRACT (to taste)
2 c  ALL PURPOSE FLOUR
1/4 ts BAKING POWDER
1/4 ts SALT
1 x  MILK FOR BRUSHING ON TOP OF
1 x  SUGAR FOR DECORATING
Use an electric mixer and beat butter or margarine until soft. Add
3/4 cup sugar and beat until fluffy. Add egg and vanilla or almond
flavoring and beat again. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together
and add to butter-sugar-egg mixture a little bit at a time. Divide
the dough into 2 parts, wrap in plastic wrap and put in the
refrigerator for 30 minutes to get hard enough to play with like
modeling clay. Then make small balls of dough and roll into ropes.
Shape the ropes into numbers or letters on an ungreased cookie sheet,
leaving a little space between them. Brush with a little milk,
sprinkle on a bit of sugar and bake at 375 degrees F for about 10
minutes.  Cool on a rack.
