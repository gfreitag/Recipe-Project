in a mixing bowl. Sift together the flour and cornflour and add, with
the almonds and sugar, to the butter. Work the ingredients together
with the hands. Turn out on to a very lightly floured surface and
finish kneading until the dough is smooth. Roll the dough into two

about 25-30 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before cutting and then
place on a wire rack to finish cooling.
