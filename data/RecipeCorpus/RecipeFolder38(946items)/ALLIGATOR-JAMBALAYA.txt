Recipes from Chef John Folse Chef John Folse Home Page In deep frying
pan (cast iron preferably) saute the bell pepper, garlic, parsley and
celery. While this is cooking, add tomatoes & their liquid, the
chicken stock &, green onion to a pot that can cook on the stove and
in the oven (Corning ware ) Stir in spices, sauteed vegetables raw
rice, sausage and alligator fillet pieces. Cook on medium-high heat
until liquid is absorbed (stir occasionally to make sure rice doesn't
burn on bottom) and then bake covered in the oven for 25 minutes.
Good luck, I done this three times and the usual comment is its
superb but where is the alligator...
