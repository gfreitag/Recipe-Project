Title: AFTERNOON TEA SANDWICHES (INFO)
Categories: Showers, Weddings
Yield: 1 Servings
Info
*  The sandwiches should be small enough to be eaten in two or three
bites.

*  Use fresh, close-textured white or brown bread, thinly sliced.

*  Whipped butter at room temperature is easy to spread without
tearing the bread.  Spread it thinly right to edges of bread.

*  Sandwiches with fillings like ham, chopped egg, smoked salmon or
anchovy paste can be made early in the day. Trim crusts within an
hour or two of serving.

*  Hold the sandwich firmly and trim crusts with a sharp knife. Cut
into four triangles or three rectangles; cover with dampened tea
towel and refrigerate.

*  To serve a dozen or fewer guests, three varieties are sufficient.
For larger occasions, provide about five varieties.
