1. Cream butter and sugar in large mixer bowl with electric mixer.
Beat in egg until light. Stir in corn syrup, orange rind and water.
Mix flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and salt. Stir into
butter mixture to form a dough. Divide dough in half. Wrap in wax
paper and refrigerate overnight.

2. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Have lightly greased baking sheets
ready.

3. Roll out one piece of dough at a time on a lightly floured
surface or between sheets of floured wax paper to 1/8 -inch
thickness. Cut into shapes with cookie cutters. Place on baking
sheets, leaving 2 inches between each cookie. Bake until golden, 8 to
10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool.

4. For icing, mix egg white and almond extract in small bowl until
frothy. Stir in confectioners' sugar until mixture is a drizzling
consistency. Drizzle over cookies. Let stand until icing sets. Store
covered.

Note: This recipe uses raw egg white. Cases of salmonella poisoning
have been traced to raw eggs, although this is rare and usually
associated with the yolks.

These orange-flavored ginger cookies captured third place for Janis
C. Peterson of Geneva, Illinois. The rolled, cutout cookies are easy
to bake, have a delicious combination of fresh tastes and are sure to
bring pleasure to the recipients. from the Chicago Tribune fourth
