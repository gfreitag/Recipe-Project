Title: A BOWL O' RED
Categories: Soups/stews, Vegetables, Chili
Yield: 8 Servings
6    To 12 chilies
3 c  Cold water
1 pk Soy or textured vegetable
-protein (12oz)
2 tb Oil
1 md Onion; chopped
1 cl Garlic; minced
1 tb Cumin
1/2 ts Red pepper
1 tb Paprika
12 c  Water
Wash, stem and remoeve seeds from the chilies.  Put chiliesin 3 cups
cold water and bring to a boil. After about 45 minutes to an hour the
skins should slip off easily. Mash the pulp into a paste. If this
seems too difficult, you can substitute chili powder at the ratio of
1 tablespoon chili powder to a pod of chili. Read the instructions on
the soy or TVP package to see if the product was soaked beforehand.
If not, use some of the water to prepare this ingredient. Saute the
onions in the olive oil until translucent. Add the garlic and spices
, then the 12 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then add the nuggets.
Reduce to a simmer, cook for 30 minutes to an hour.  If this seems
too runny, you can thicken with masa, the cornmeal flour used in
tortillas. When made in bulk, this chili can readily be frozen.
