The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra
knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a
lighter loaf.  When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset
the machine and start again.  Some manufacturers produce home
bakeries with a whole wheat cycle; if your machine doesn't have one,
this start- again method works as an easy alternative. SUCCESS HINTS:
The gluten gives the whole wheat flour the structure necessary for a
good loaf. If your market doesn't stock wheat gluten, try your local
health food store. Remember the extra knead.  It's especially
important in 100% whole wheat bread. Because of the extra knead, us
this recipe only on the regular bake cycle. CALORIES: 125 PROTEIN:
