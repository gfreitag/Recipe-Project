In a medium mixing bowl, blend together 1-1/2 cups flour, sugar,
baking powder, salt, oil, milk, egg and 1 cup blueberries. Beat
thoroughly for 30 seconds and spread in a greased round 9x1-1/2-inch
pan or an 8x8x2-inch pan. Combine 1/3 cup flour, brown sugar,
connamon and butter. Sprinkle over batter and top with the remaining
berries. Bake in a 375 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until done.
Don't overbake. Serve warm with butter or honey. Serves 8.

Sonya's note: If I remember correctly, this takes a bit longer to
bake than what is in the instructions, but it is worth the wait!
