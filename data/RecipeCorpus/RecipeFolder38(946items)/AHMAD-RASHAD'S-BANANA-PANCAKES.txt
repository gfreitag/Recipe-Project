According to NBC sportscaster Ahmad Rashad, men and women behave very
differently in the kitchen. "When men cook, it usually looks like a
disaster area," says the former Minnesota Viking. "And there's no
rhyme or reason to what they make. My father sometimes cooked chicken
for breakfast. And when he cooked, everything came out six times
bigger than when Mom cooked."

Rashad's father prepared banana pancakes for him when he was a little
boy, back in Tacoma, Washington. Washad, in turn, makes them for his
5-year-old daughter, Condola Phylea. On Super Bowl Sunday, he
promises, she'll be starting off her day with a short stack.

1. In a mixing bowl, using a hand or electric mixer, beat eggs for 2
minutes until frothy. Add flour, baking powder, milk and oil. Stir in
bananas.

2. On a hot griddle, pour 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. Cook until
edges become dry, about 2 minues per side. Top with banana slices.
Drizzle with honey or maple syrup and sprinkle with pecans.
