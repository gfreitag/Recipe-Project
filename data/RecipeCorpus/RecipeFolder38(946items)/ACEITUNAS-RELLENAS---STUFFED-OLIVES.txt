Title: ACEITUNAS RELLENAS - STUFFED OLIVES
Categories: Appetizers, Mexican
Yield: 6 Servings
7 1/2 oz Can Pitted Olives
3/4 oz Can Anchovy Fillets, Cut In
- Small Pieces
1    Can Chopped Pimentos
1    Clove Garlic, Mashed Or
- Pressed
1/3 c  Wine Vinegar
1 tb Olive Oil
Oil From Anchovies
1/4 c  Minced Parsley
Drain olives and stuff with the anchovy fillets. Combine the other
ingredients, except parsley; pour over the olives and marinate
over-night. Mix in parsley half an hour before serving. If the idea
of stuffing the olives throws you, don't do it.  Simply add the
anchovies to the marinade and pour over the olives. These will keep
for a week or more if parsley is added just before serving.
