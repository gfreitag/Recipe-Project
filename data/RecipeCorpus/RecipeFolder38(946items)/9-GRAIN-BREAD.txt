THis bread will not only nourish you, it will surprise you with its
unique and delightful flavor and texture. Definetly worth the extra
effort of finding the 9-grain mix ingredients. The mix will keep well
in the refrigerator - we're sure you'll want to make this bread again
(try a handful in pancakes!).

Mix the water, molasses, malt and yeast.  Add the 9 grain mix, flour,
salt and oil (you can also make a sponge and wait, but it's not
necessary). Mix, and knead dough well. Let rise, shape into loaves
and let rise again in oiled bread pans.  Bake at 350 F for 45 min.
