Preparation time: 2 hours Cooking time: 15 to 20 minutes

1. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Have ready ungreased baking sheets.
2. Beat butter in large bowl of electric mixer until light and
fluffy. Beat in half of the flour, the sugar, vanilla and water until
thoroughly combined. Beat in the remaining flour.
3. Use a scant 1 tablespoon of dough and press it flat and thin with
your hands. Put a chocolate mint wafer in the center and fold the
dough over to completely cover each chocolate and to form a neat,
rectangular package. Pinch the edges to seal. Place 1 inch apart on
ungreased baking sheets.
4. Bake until bottoms are lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool a
few minutes on the baking sheets and then cool completely on wire
racks.
5. For icing, mix confectioners' sugar and milk to make a thin icing;
color icing as desired. Use a small spatula to ice cookies. Decorate
as desired so cookies resemble Christmas packages.

For variety, second-place winner Carol Feezell of Skokie, Illinois
uses several kinds of miniature candies in her pretty cookies. She
suggests filling the cookies with chocolate mint wafers, such as
Andes, or Hershey's Miniatures. We also enjoyed Lindt's orange
chocolate thins when we made the cookies in the Tribune test kitchen.
