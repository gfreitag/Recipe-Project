3    Garlic cloves, minced
2    Onions, chopped
2    Carrots, diced
1 tb Red wine vinegar
1/2 ts Dried rosemary, crushed

19 oz Can Romano or kidney beans,

onions and carrots, covered, for about 10 minutes or until softened.
Stir in vinegar, rosemary, pepper and hot pepper flakes; cook,
covered, for about 15 minutes or until onions are very soft. Stir in
sauce; bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer for about 5 minutes or
until thickened. Stir in beans; set aside.

Meanwhile, in large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta for 5
minutes. Add broccoli; [tip: peel broccoli stalks so that they will
cook in the same amount of time as the florets.] cook for about 1
minute or until pasta is almost tender and broccoli is bright green
and still crisp. Drain and return to pot. Stir in tomato mixture.
Pour into greased 8-inch square baking dish; sprinkle with Romano
cheese. Cover with foil.

[Can be prepared to this point and cooled in refrigerator. Cove and
refrigerate for up to 4 hours. Let stand at room temperature for 30
minutes before baking. Add 30 minutes to baking time.]

Bake in 350F 180C oven for about 35 minutes or until heated through.
Broil, uncovered, for about 2 minutes or until browned and bubbly.

Serve with crisp cucumber and red onion salad.
