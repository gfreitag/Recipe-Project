Starting a day ahead, peel the turnips &, one at a time, slice them
in the following fashion: Make thin slices down to within 1/8" of the
base, move the turnip a half turn clockwise & make similar slices
intersecting the first ones.  Now cut each turnip into quarters. In a
mixing bowl, stir the salt into 1/4 c cold water. Add the turnips.
Soak in the refrigerator for 24 hours. The following day, cover the
dried red pepper with cold water & soak at room temperature for about
1 hour, or until soft. Cut off the top of the pepper, remove &
discard the seeds, slice the pepper crosswise into very thin rings.
Wrap the piece of kombu in a damp towel and let it rest for about an
hour, or until it is soft and pliable. Cut into strips 1" by 1/8"
wide. Drain the turnips & squeeze them firmly until dry. Combine the
vinegar, 1/2 c cold water, sugar & a sprinkle of soy sauce in a 1 1/2
to 2 qt jar & stir thoroughly. Add the turnips, pepper rings and
kombu, & stir again. Cover tightly with a jar cover or plastic wrap,
& refrigerate for at least 12 hours before serving. Will keep for 3
or 4 days.
