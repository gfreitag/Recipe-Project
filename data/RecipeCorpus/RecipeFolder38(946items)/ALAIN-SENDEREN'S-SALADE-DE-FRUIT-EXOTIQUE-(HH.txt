Categories: Desserts, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Plus 2 teaspoons sugar
1/2    Vanilla bean, split
3    Coriander seeds
1    Whole clove
1/4 ts Five-spice powder
Zest of 1 lime
Zest of 1/2 lemon
1/2 ts Chopped fresh ginger
1    Sprig of fresh mint (OPT)
1 tb Fresh lime juice
1    Pineapple
1    Mango
2    Large kiwis
2    Passion fruits
And ideal fruit salad or dessert for Winter, because the tropical
fruits are available year-round and ripen naturally. The riper and
more fragrant the fruit, the better the salad. 
In a small saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups water with the sugar, vanilla
bean, coriander seeds, clove, five-spice powder, lime and lemon
zests, ginger, and mint, if using. Simmer over moderate heat for 10
minutes. Set aside to cook.  Then stir in the lime juice. (The syrup
can be made up and refrigerated for up to a week before serving the
salad.) 
Slice off the top and the rind from the pineapple; quarter it
lengthwise. Reserve 3 of the quarters for another use. Slice 1 of the
quarters crosswise 1/8-inch thick. Using a sharp paring knife, peel
the mango and slice lengthwise, parallel to the pit on both sides,
into disks 1/8-inch thick.  Slice each mango disk in half lengthwise.
Peel the kiwis and halve lengthwise.  Cut each half lengthwise into
thin wedges. 
Divide the fruit evenly and arrange in each of 4 shallow soup bowls,
overlapping the slices to form a decorative pattern. Strain the
reserved syrup and divide equally among the 4 servings. Cover with
plastic wrap and refirgerate for at least 1 or up to 4 hours. Just
before serving, halve the passion fruits crosswise. Using a teaspoon,
scoop the pulk out of each half onto the fruit in each bowl. 
