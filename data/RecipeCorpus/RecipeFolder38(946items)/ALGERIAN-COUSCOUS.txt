drop back into pan, making sure couscous is lump free. Let this dry
while preparing remainders. Fry onions garlic, pepper, carrot and
eggplant with chicken and lamb in oil. Then add chickpeas( if using
dried ones ) and enough water to cover. Add pimento and salt and
pepper to taste,Bring to a boil and fasten colander over kettle to
fit snugly. Spoon couscous into colander and let steam for 45
minutes, then dump couscous back into pan to let dry again. Add
tomatoes, beans or peas and cook another 1/2 hour. Now attach
colander and let couscous steam another 15 minutes. Add artichoke,
canned chickpeas to the stew.  Cook a few minutes longer. Add some
butter to the couscous and place couscous shaped into a cone on a
serving platter. surround by meat and vegetables. Note: this is only
one version of many different types of couscous preparation. It is
thought that the name of this grain comes from the soft rumbling
noise that the couscous makes in a steamer. There is a special
couscous pot but a colander can suffice.
