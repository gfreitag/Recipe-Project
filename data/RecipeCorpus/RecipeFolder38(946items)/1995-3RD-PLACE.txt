Categories: Cookies, Holiday
Yield: 6 Dozen
3 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Unsweetened cocoa
3/4 ts Baking soda
1 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Mace
1 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1/2 ts Allspice
1/4 lb Candied pineapple
1/4 lb Citron
1/4 lb Candied orange peel
1/4 lb Pitted dates
1/4 lb Figs
1/4 c  Dried or candied cherries
1 lb Chopped pecans
1 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Dried currants
1 c  Unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3    Eggs
1 tb Cold, strong coffee
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ready ungreased or parchment-lined
baking sheet(s). Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and
spices. Cut candied fruits, dates and figs into small pieces and toss
with a small amount of the  flour mixture. Combine in a large bowl
with the pecans, raisins and currants.  Set aside.

2. Beat butter and sugar in large bowl of electric mixer on high
speed until light, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time,
mixing well after  each addition. Mix in the coffee. Stop the mixer
and add the flour mixture.  Mix on low speed just until combined.
Using a wooden spoon, fold in the fruit  and nut mixture to coat all
the pieces.

3. Drop batter onto baking sheet in walnut-size mounds leaving about
2 inches between each cookie. Bake until set and tops are lightly
browned, 14 to 16 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Store in
an airtight container,  with a small wedge of apple to keep them
soft. The cookies may be glazed or sprinkled with confectioners'
sugar, if desired.
