Title: ALL-AMERICAN PIE PASTRY
Categories: Pies
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Frozen lard or shortening
- cut into bits
3 tb Ice water
To ensure a tender crust, this recipe should not be doubled.
Thoroughly freezing the lard or shortening will give you the flakiest
crust.

PLACE THE FLOUR AND SALT in the bowl of a food processor and pulse 2-3
times. Scatter the lard or shortening over the flour mixture.
Sprinkle with the water and process about 5 seconds or until dough
just begins to form. Shape into a ball, then flatten it slightly.
Dust lightly with flour and place in the center of a 2-gallon-size
plastic storage bag. It may be refrigerated at this point up to 40
minutes. With the storage bag open and the dough circle centered in
the bag, roll the dough into a circle that almost touches the edges
of the bag. Cut and discard the top sheet of the plastic bag so that
the dough is lying on the bottom sheet. Flip onto the pie plate; peel
the plastic off and discard. Cut the pastry so it hangs about an inch
over the rim. Lightly press the overhanging pastry under (between the
pastry and the pie tin). Pinch or crease the edges of the pastry in a
zigzag or fluted pattern. This is not only decorative, it also acts
as a wall to keep the filling in. Yield: 1 single-crust 8- to 10-inch
pie shell.
