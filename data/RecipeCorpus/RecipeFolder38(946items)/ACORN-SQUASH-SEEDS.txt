Title: ACORN SQUASH SEEDS
Categories: Snacks, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ea Acorn squash
1 ts Margarine
Salt to taste
NOTE:  Acorn squash seeds taste similar to pumpkin seeds except that
the hulls on the squash seed are smaller. Therefore they are less dry
tasting than pumpkin seeds and don't get caught in your throat as
easily.

Cut uncooked squash in half and scoop out seeds. Clean pulp and
strings off the seeds in a collander under running water. Set the
seeds on a towel to dry. Preheat oven to 350 deg. The seeds in a
small bowl. Either melt margarine and pour onto seeds or put solid
margarine into bowl and mix with you hands (my preferred method).
Spread seeds evenly on a cookie sheet. Place in oven and cook 10 min.
or until just starts to turn brown.
