Yield: 12 Servings
1/3 c  (approximately) corn oil
6 lb Beef chuck -- in 1/2-inch
Cubes
c  Minced onion
1/3 c  Minced garlic
3 c  (approximately) beef broth

If needed
1. In a large heavy skillet over moderately high heat, warm 3
tablespoons of the oil. Brown beef in batches, adding more oil as
necessary and transferring meat with a slotted spoon to a large
stockpot when well browned. Do not crowd skillet.

2. Reduce heat to moderately low. Add onion and garlic and saute until
softened (about 10 minutes). Add to stockpot along with broth, beer,
the water, chili powder, tomato, tomato paste, and oregano.

3. In a small skillet over low heat, toast cumin seed until fragrant;
do not allow to burn. Grind in an electric minichopper or with a
mortar and pestle. Add to stockpot.

4. Over high heat bring mixture to a simmer. Add salt, cayenne, and
more chili powder to taste. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and
cook, partially covered, until beef is tender (about 1-1/2 hours).
Check occasionally and add more broth if mixture seems dry. If chili
is too thin when meat is tender, stir in up to 2 tablespoons masa
harina. Cook an additional 5 minutes to thicken. Serve chili hot.
