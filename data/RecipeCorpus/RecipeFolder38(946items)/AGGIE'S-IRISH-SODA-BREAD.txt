Title: AGGIE'S IRISH SODA BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
3 c  Unbleached white flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
12 tb (1 1/2 sticks) cold, sweet
-butter
2 c  Raisins
1    Egg
1/2 c  Honey
1 c  Buttermilk
Makes 1 large loaf.

Preheat oven to 350F.

Sift the flour, baking powder, soda and salt into a large mixing
bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces and add. Cut it into the flour
with a pastry blender until the mixture is the size of peas. Add the
raisins and toss to distribute evenly, using two forks.

Beat the egg in another bowl until very frothy.  Beat in the honey.
When it is well blended, beat in the buttermilk.

Gradually pour the liquids into the flour, tossing all the while with
a fork so the mixture gets evenly moistened. Continue tossing lightly
with two forks until the batter comes together; it doesn't have to be
completely mixed and should be very rough and lumpy.

Butter a heavy skillet or casserole, 10 to 11 inches in diameter and
2 to 3 inches deep.  Round is the traditional shape. Spoon batter out
into the pan and push it gently to fill the pan. It can mound up
somewhat in the middle. Bake at 350 F about an hour or until the
middle is set. Cut out a piece to test if necessary.

Cut into wedges and serve warm from the pan.
