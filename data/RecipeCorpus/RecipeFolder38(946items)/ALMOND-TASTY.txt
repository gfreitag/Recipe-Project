Title: ALMOND TASTY
Categories: Alcohol, Beverages
Yield: 1 Pint
1 c  Unsalted almonds, chopped
1 ts Chocolate extract
1    Vanilla bean (1 inch)
1/2    Orange peel, scraped
2 c  Vodka
1 sm Lemon wedge, scraped peel
Lightly pound almonds with hammer (in bag or cover with paper towel)
and combine with other ingredients in bottle. Be sure to thoroughly
scrape orange and lemon peels. Let steep for two weeks, turning bottle
occasionally. The chocolate extract tends to settle on the bottom and
the finished liqueur may need to be mixed before serving. Strain and
filter. Experiment with different variations of this recipe, perhaps
alternating hazelnuts or adding some spices. Yield: 1 pint Container:
