(Units: 100 g = 3 1/2 oz; 1 dl = 3 1/2 fl oz = 2/5 cup; 180 oC = 350
oF; 200 oC = 400 oF; 230 oC = 450 oF; 250 oC = 475 oF; 2.5 cm = 1
inch)

Preparation:

Pre-heat the oven to 200 oC. Butter and flour a tart tin with a
removable base 22 cm in diameter.

Roll out the pastry to fit the tart tin. Line the tin with the pastry
and prick the bottom all over with a fork. Bake it for 10 minutes at
the bottom of the pre-heated oven. Leave the pastry shell in the tin.

Cooking:

Lightly brush a thin layer of apricot glaze over the bottom of the
pastry shell.

Put all the remaining ingredients for the filling into a saucepan and
heat them gently, stirring to mix them well as they melt.

Raise the oven to 210 oC. When the filling is melted, spread it in a
thin layer on the glazed pastry shell.

Cook it for about 15 minutes: it is ready when the filling begins to
bubble.

Leave the cake to cool in its tin, then take it out.

Serving:

Cut the cake into little triangles or rectangular pieces. Serve them
with coffee, like 'petits fours'.
