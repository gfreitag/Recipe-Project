Title: ALASKA PATTIES
Categories: Main dish, Fish, Kids
Yield: 4 Servings
105 g  Canned pink Alaska salmon
25 g  Cream or curd cheese
2    Spring onions
- finely chopped
1/4    Red pepper; finely chopped
200 g  Strong plain flour
2    Eggs; beaten
1 pn Salt
2 ts Freshly chopped basil
435 g  Canned tomato soup
50 g  Cheddar cheese, grated
Pre-heat oven to 375 F, 190 C, Gas mark 5.

Drain the can of salmon. Flake the fish. Mix with the cheese, onions
and red pepper. Set aside. Put the flour into a bowl, add the eggs,
salt and basil. Mix well to form a soft dough. Divide into egg size
pieces. Knead until smooth.

Roll the dough pieces on a lightly floured board to a maximum 2mm /
1/10 inch thick or roll each piece through a pasta maker reducing the
setting to 5 or 6 over 3 or 4 rollings. Cut the pasta sheets into 3cm
/ 1 1/2 inch squares. Put salmon filling onto one corner of each
square then fold in half diagonally to make a triangular "pattie".
Dry on silicone paper for 1 hour before cooking, turning each pattie
over after 30 minutes to dry undersides.

Put the soup into a casserole dish and drop the salmon patties into
it. Cover with a lid and cook in the oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and
sprinkle with the cheese. Continue cooking for a further 10 minutes.
Serve with salad.
