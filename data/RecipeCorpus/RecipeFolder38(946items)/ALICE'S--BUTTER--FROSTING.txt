Title: ALICE'S  BUTTER  FROSTING
Categories: Kaz
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Butter flavored Crisco or 2
Sticks (1/4 lb
2/3 c  Milk
1 tb Vanilla
Mix sugar and Crisco together.  Heat milk until hot on finger. (Do not
boil.)  Add half of the milk to sugar ~ Crisco mixture and beat 2
minutes. Add rest of milk and beat 8 minutes longer (a total of 10
minutes all together). The beating breaks up the sugar granules to a
whipped cream consistency, but is a butter type.

To make a whipped cream frosting, use white Crisco instead of
butter-flavored. (This is Audrey's (my sister-in-laws recipe.) (I use
these often as I don't always have confectioners sugar on hand.)
