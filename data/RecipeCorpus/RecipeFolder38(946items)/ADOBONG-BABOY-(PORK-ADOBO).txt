Title: ADOBONG BABOY (PORK ADOBO)
Categories: Phillipines, Ham/pork
Yield: 3 Servings
1 lb Pork Loin - cut into chunks
1    Head Garlic
1/4 c  Soy Sauce
1 ts Black Pepper(freshly ground)
1/2 c  White Vinegar
1 tb Vegetable Oil
Place the pork in a medium-size pot together with the garlic, soy
sauce, pepper and vinegar and let stand for 2 hours. *(See note
below) Cook slowly in the same pot until the pork is tender (about 30
minutes). Transfer pieces of garlic to a seperate pan and fry in hot
oil until brown. Add the pork pieces to the garlic and the fry until
brown. Drain. Add the broth to the fried pork and garlic and simmer
for 10 minutes.

* Note (I usually brown the pork BEFORE I add it to the soy sauce
mixture in order to render more of the fat out.
