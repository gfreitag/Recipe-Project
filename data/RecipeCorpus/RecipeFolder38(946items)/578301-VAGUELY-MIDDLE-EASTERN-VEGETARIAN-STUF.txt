Bring 2 cups of water to boil, adding the rice and turmeric. Return
to a boil, cover and simmer for 25 minutes. Cook the lentils in 3
cups of boiling water until soft. Saute the onion, pepper, and garlic
in olive oil. In a large bowl, combine the sauteed vegetables, rice,
lentils, almonds and raisins.  Fill each cabbage leaf with about 1/2
to 3/4 cup filling, beginning at the thick end of the leaf. Begin to
fold this over, folding the edges in as you go to make a neat roll.
Place the rolls in one or two casseroles, covering with the sauce. To
prepare the sauce, combine the tomatoes, vinegar, basil and cinnamon
in a large saucepan. Adjust the cinnamon/basil mix until it's hard to
taste either seasoning alone, and then add the salt and pepper.
Simmer for 10 minutes. Bake the cabbage rolls covered at 350 degrees,
45-60 minutes.
