Title: 1~ 2~ 3~ PUNCH
Categories: Gin
Yield: 1 Servings
26 oz Rye --
2    Bottles sherry
3    Bottles ginger ale
2    Whole oranges -- sliced
Pour 2 bottles of the ginger ale into a bundt pan and add some of the
orange slices. Freeze and use as ice ring as it doesn't dilute the
punch when it melts.  Punch does become smoother as the ring melts.
Put orange slices in the punch bowl and add other ingredients. (You
may wish to have one more bottle of ginger ale to make the ice ring.)
