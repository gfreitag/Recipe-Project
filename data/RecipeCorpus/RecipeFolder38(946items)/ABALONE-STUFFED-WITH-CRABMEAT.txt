MMMMM--------------------------ABALONE-------------------------------
Butter or margarine
2    Shallots; minced
1 c  Cooked crabmeat
Salt, white pepper
1 ds Red pepper
1/2 ts Dry mustard
1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/2    Lemon (juice only)
4    Large abalone steaks
2    Eggs; beaten
Flour
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in skillet and stir in flour. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, over medium heat about 1
minute but do not allow flour to brown. Add milk and cook and stir 1
or 2 minutes until mixture comes to boil and thickens. Set aside. For
abalone, melt 1 tablespoon butter in small saucepan, add shallots and
cook until tender but not browned. Add crabmeat and heat thoroughly.
Add enough white sauce to bind, about 1/2 cup. Season to taste with
salt and white pepper and add red pepper, mustard, Worcestershire and
lemon juice. Carefully pound abalone steaks between 2 sheets of waxed
paper until very thin (unless purchased already pounded). Dip abalone
in eggs seasoned to taste with salt and white pepper. Coat with flour
and set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy skillet. Add
abalone and brown quickly on one side. Turn and brown other side. Do
not overcook as abalone will toughen. Place abalone steaks on platter
and spoon crabmeat stuffing on each. Roll and arrange on serving
platter, seam down. If desired, serve with any remaining sauce.
