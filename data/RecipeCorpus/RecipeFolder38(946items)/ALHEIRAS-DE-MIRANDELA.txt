Title: ALHEIRAS DE MIRANDELA
Categories: Meats
Yield: 15 Units
3 lb Lean beef*
1 1/2 lb Calf meat
1/2 lb Chicken
1/2 lb Turkey
1/2 lb Rabbit
1 1/2 lb Day old wheat bread
1/4 lb Ham (optional)
4    Garlic cloves
4 ts Olive oil
2 oz Pork drippings**
Paprika, salt and
-piripiri to taste
10    Feet tripe casing
*    Or lean pork, or a mixture of both, for cost reasons. **
Probably a modern addition, or replacement for suet. You may change
the proportions of chicken/turkey/rabbit - it may be all chicken,
etc., provided the total amount remains the same. You can use
partridge, quail, duck, and so on... Boil the meats together long
enough to make the bones separate from the meat by themselves.
Reserve the resulting broth and set meats aside. In a large bowl
place the thinly sliced bread and add the reserved broth. Cover with
a towel and, as soon as the bread is soft enough, mash it with an
wooden spoon. Add the mashed garlic and ground piripiri, paprika and
a little salt. Add the meats cut in very little pieces. Mix
thoroughly. When everything is completely mixed add the olive oil and
the pork drippings, hot. Fill the casing using a suitable funnel. Tie
each 'alheira' so that it's about 8" long, with the filling
concentrated in the middle section, leaving the ends almost empty.
Smoke for 2 or 3 hours a day, for a week. Tie both ends together
before selling or using - the 'alheira' should be U shaped. A typical
way of serving 'alheiras' is frying them in hot oil, and presenting
them with fried eggs and potato chips. Some add broccoli as a side
dish.
