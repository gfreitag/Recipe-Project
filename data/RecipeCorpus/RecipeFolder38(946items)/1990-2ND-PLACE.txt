Second place went to Nancy Rullo, of Bloomingdale, for her recipe for
Mom's sugar cookies in the shape of Santa Claus faces, iced with a
cream cheese frosting and decorated in traditional holiday colors.
The recipe, Rullo wrote, was one that her mother had found in her
mother's first cookbook. As children, Rullo and her brother would
help cut out the Santa Claus shapes and watch them bake. from the
