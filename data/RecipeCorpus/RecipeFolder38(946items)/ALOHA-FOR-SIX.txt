onion, sugar, 1/2 ts of the salt, the vinegar and garlic. Cover and
stir occasionally, for about 20 minutes or until translucent but not
browned. Remove from pan and set aside.

Recipe can be prepared to this point and refrigerated in airtight
container for up to 8 hours.

Increase heat to high. Add broccoli, red pepper, pepper and remaining
salt to pan; toss to combine. Add stock; returning onions to pan.
Cover and cook, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes or until broccoli
is tender-crisp.
