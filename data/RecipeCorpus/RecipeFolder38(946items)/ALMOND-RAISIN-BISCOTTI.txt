Categories: New text im, Biscotti, Cooking rig
3 lg Eggs Separated
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/3 c  (5 1/3 Tablespoons) Butter
melted and cooled
:
1 c  Lightly Toasted And Coarsely
Chopped Almon
:
1/2 c  Raisins -- * see note
2 TB Chopped Candied Orange Peel
<<Or>>
:
3 TB Orange Zest -- grated
3 1/2 c  Unbleached All-Purpose
Flour
:
1 1/2 ts Baking Powder

Preheat the oven to 325=B0F. Butter a baking sheet or line it with
parchment. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with 3/4 cup of the
sugar until light and the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the melted
butter, almonds, raisins and orange peel. In a separate bowl, beat
the egg whites until they just begin to form peaks and gradually beat
in the remaining 3/4 cup sugar until the whites form stiff peaks.

Sift the flour and baking powder together. Fold in 1/3 of the flour
into the yolks; then fold 1/3 of the egg whites in. Repeat,
alternating, until well combined. The dough will be firm and slightly
sticky. If the dough is too soft, add more flour. With floured hands,
divide the dough into two logs approximately 1 1/2 inches wide.
Arrange the logs on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20 to 25
minutes or until they are lightly brown and firm to the touch. Remove
from the oven and set the baking sheet on a rack for 10 minutes. On a
cutting board, cut the logs on a diagonal into slices 1/2 inch wide.
Return the slices to the baking sheet and bake for 5 to 7 minutes on
each side or until the biscotti are very lightly browned and crisp.
Cool on racks and store in airtight containers.

Yield: About 36 biscotti
