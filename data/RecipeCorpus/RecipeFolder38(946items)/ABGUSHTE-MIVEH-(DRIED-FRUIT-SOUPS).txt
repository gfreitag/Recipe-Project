1 lb Lean lamb or beef stew meat
1 lb Lamb or beef soup bones
7 c  ;water
1    Limu omani (dried lime);
-optional
Freshly ground black pepper
2 tb Ghee or butter
1 lg Onion; finely chopped
2 ts Turmeric

Cut meat into small cubes and place in a soup pot with bones, water,
and dried lime if available.  Bring slowly to the boil, skimming when
necessary.  Add salt and pepper, cover and simmer gently for 1 1/2
hours or until meat is almost tender.  Remove bones and dried lime if
used.

In a frying pan, heat ghee or butter and fry onion until transparent,
stir in turmeric, and cook until lightly browned. Add to soup with
dried fruits (these may be washed if necessary, but do not require
soaking). Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.  Add sugar and lemon or
lime juice to taste so that soup has a pleasant sweet-sour flavor.
