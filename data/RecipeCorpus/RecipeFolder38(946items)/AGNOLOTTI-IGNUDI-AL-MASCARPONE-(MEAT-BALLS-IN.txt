Cut the prosciutto and pancetta into small pieces and remove the
casing from the sausages. Using a meat grinder, grind together the
prosciutto, pancetta, and sausages. Place the ground meat in a
crockery or glass bowl, add the butter and eggs, and mix very well
with a wooden spoon until the butter is completely incorporated. Add
the bread crumbs and Parmesan, and season with salt and pepper. Cover
the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before using.

When ready, bring the broth to a boil in a large pot over medium heat.
Meanwhile, place a large skillet with the butter over low heat. When
the broth reaches a boil, start shaping the meat mixture into tiny
meat balls; a heaping tablespoon of mixture will be enough to prepare
several. Make sure the meat balls are solid with no holes inside.
Drop the balls into the boiling broth a few at a time, and as they
rise to the top, tansfer them with a slotted spoon to the skillet
containing the butter. When all the meat balls are cooked and in the
skillet, add the mascarpone and heavy cream. Mix very well and simmer
for 1 or 2 minutes, or until the mascarpone is completely dissolved.
Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Mix very well, then transfer to
a warmed serving platter. Serve immediately, with some Parmesan on
the side.
