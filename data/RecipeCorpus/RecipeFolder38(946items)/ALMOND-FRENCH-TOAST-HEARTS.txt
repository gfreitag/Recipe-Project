Title: ALMOND FRENCH TOAST HEARTS
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 2 Servings
6    1" thick slices bread
1/4 c  Milk
2    Eggs, beaten
1/2 ts Almond extract
2 tb Butter or margarine
Sifted powdered sugar
Fresh strawberries (opt)
MMMMM-----------------------ALMOND BUTTER----------------------------
1 c  Butter, softened
3 tb Sifted powdered sugar
1 ts Almond extract
Cut a heart shape from each bread slice, using a 3 1/2" heart shaped
cookie cutter. Reserve bread trimmings for other uses.

Combine milk, eggs and almond extract in a shallow dish; stir well.
Dip 3 heart shaped bread slices into egg mixture, turning to coat
both sides.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet or on a hot griddle;
arrange the 3 slices of bread in the skillet, and cook over medium
heat 3 minutes on each side or until golden.  Transfer to a serving
plate, and keep warm.
Repeat procedure with remaining bread slices, egg mixture and butter.
Sprinkle French toast with powdered sugar.

Spoon Almond Butter into a pastry bag fitted with a decorative tip
and pipe butter onto center of each heart, if desired. Garnish with
fresh strawberries if desired.

For Almond Butter: Combine all ingredients in a medium mixing bowl;
beat at medium speed of an electric mixer until smooth. Chill until
slightly firm but still soft enough to pipe.
