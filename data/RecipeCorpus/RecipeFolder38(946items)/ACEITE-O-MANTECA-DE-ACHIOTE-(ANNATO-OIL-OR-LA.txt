Title: ACEITE O MANTECA DE ACHIOTE (ANNATO OIL OR LA
Categories: Caribbean, Condiments, Upload
Yield: 1 Cup
1 c  Oil, vegetable
1/2 c  Annatto seeds
Heat the oil in a small saucepan, add the seeds and cook over low
heat for about 5 minutes, stirring from time to time, until a rich
orange color is obtained. Cool, strain and store in a covered jar in
the refrigerator. It will keep for several months.
If the seeds are cooked too long, the orange color will change to a
golden color and much of the flavor is lost. Very stale seeds will
give off all their color in one minute of cooking. Watch the saucepan
carefully and remove it from the heat immediately the color begins to
lighten.
