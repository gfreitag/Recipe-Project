[I think this recipe assumes raw crabmeat to start; refer to
instructions below about boiling crab meat and alter technique if
using pre-cooked crab meat, perhaps by just boiling some ginger and
cloves in small amount of water and adding a bit to flavor crab. --
cmt]

Put crab meat in boiling salted water along with ginger piece and
cloves. Cook about 15 minutes, until meat is tender enough to flake
with a fork. Drain, flake and set aside.

In a heavy pot, heat oil to a moderate temperature and add other
ingredients in the following sequence, stirring for a minute or so
between each: onions, ground ginger, tomatoes, tomato paste, green
pepper, paprika, cayenne, and dried shrimp.  Reduce heat and simmer
for 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly, until vegetables are cooked.
Add crab meat and stir another couple of minutes to heat it through.
Then spoon the mixture into clean crab shells or ramekins (small
individual baking dishes).

Sprinkle bread crumbs on top of each crab and toast under an oven
broiler, being careful not to let the crumbs scorch. Garnish with egg
and parsley.
