Title: AIOLI SAUCE - GARLIC MAYONAISE
Categories: Sauces, Condiments
Yield: 1 Cups
5    Garlic cloves
1    Egg, at room temperature
1 c  Olive oil, at room temp.
1 tb Lemon juice
Crush the garlic in a food blender. Add the egg, and blend for 15
seconds. Very slowly add the oil through the top of the blender so
that an emulsion can take place. Stir in the lemon juice by hand.
Hint: To get the smell of garlic off your hands, simply rub your
hands in used coffee grinds. End of odor. In Italy, it is common to
eat a whole coffee bean after a big meal so that your lover will not
be bothered by garlic.
