MMMMM-------------------FOR FILLING AND ICING------------------------
3/4 c  Orange juice; strained
2 tb Lemon juice
3/4 c  Sugar; granulated
1 tb Orange rind; finely grated
Makes: Icing and filling for one cake. SEE: Cake, 1-2-3-4 Cake by
James Beard for the cake recipe.
Mix the orange juice, lemon juice, sugar and orange rind
:
together and drizzle the mixture over the three still warm cake
layers. Be careful not to let it all soak into one spot.
Then pile the layers on top of each other. The juice mixture

will give the cake a lovely, fresh, fruity flavor and it is not rich
like a chocolate or other candy flavored icing. Leave the cake to
cool.
