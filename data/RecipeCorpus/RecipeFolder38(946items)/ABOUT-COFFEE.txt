Start with a thoroughly clean coffee maker. Wash after each use with
hot, soapy water and rinse well with hot water; never scour with an
abrasive pad. When cleaning an automatic coffee maker, follow the
manufacturer's directions.

Always use fresh coffee and freshly drawn cold water. Never use hot
water, especially in automatic coffee makers; it changes percolating
time.

Serve steaming-hot coffee as soon as possible after brewing. If
coffee must stand any length of time, remove grounds and hold coffee
at serving temperature over very low heat.

Keep ground coffee tightly covered.

PREPARATION METHODS Automatic: Follow manufacturer's directions for
selecting grind of coffee (special ones are available), measuring and
brewing the coffee and holding the coffee at serving temperature.

Drip: Measure cold water and heat to boiling. Preheat coffeepot by
rinsing with very hot water. Measure drip-grind coffee into filter
paper in cone or into filter section of coffee-pot depending on the
type of drip pot used. Pour measured fresh boiling water into upper
container; cover. When dripping is completed, remove upper container
and filter section.
