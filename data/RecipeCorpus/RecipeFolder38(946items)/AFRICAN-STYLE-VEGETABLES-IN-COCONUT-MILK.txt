Title: AFRICAN STYLE VEGETABLES IN COCONUT MILK
Categories: Side dish, African, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Ghee -=OR=- vegetable oil
3 ea Whole cloves
1 lg Onion, chopped
2 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
1 c  Potatoes, cubed
2 c  Carrots, diced
2 c  Green beans, chopped
1/2 tb Berbere
1/2 tb Hungarian paprika
1/2 c  Coconut milk
Salt & pepper
Cilantro, chopped
Heat ghee or vegetable oil with the whole cloves over low heat. When
hot, add the onions & garlic & saute, stirring occasionally, for a
few moments. Add the carrots & potatoes & continue to saute for 5
minutes, stir to prevent sticking.  Add the green beans & saute for
just a few more minutes. Slowly stir in the coconut milk.  Use only
as much as you need to create a thick sauce: the vegetables should
not be swimming in milk. Carefully bring to a boil, reduce heat &
simmer until the vegetables are cooked, 15 to 20 minutes.  Stir
occasionally otherwise the milk & vegetables will burn. Garnish with
cilantro. Serve with an Ethiopian Lentil stew or with an Indian dal
to mix cuisines, & bread. If you prefer the vegetables to be hotter,
add more berbere. It is best if this dish is made ahead of time &
then left to let the flavours marry. In place of cilantro, use fresh
parsley.
