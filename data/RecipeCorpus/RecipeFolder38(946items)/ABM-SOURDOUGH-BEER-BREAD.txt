Categories: Breads, Tested, Breadmaker
Yield: 14 Servings
1 ts Yeast
2 c  King Arthur allpurpose flour
2 ts Sugar
1 tb Lecithin granules
1 ts Salt
3/4 c  Rye sourdough starter*
1/4 c  Flat beer
2 tb Water
Place in pan in the order given. Bake on basic bread cycle. This can
probably be timed. With only 2 cups of flour, this makes a small (14
oz) loaf with a crunchy crust and a light interior.  Not a dense
bread. It's a rustic looking loaf that ought to be just the thing
with stews or hearty soups. *Rye sarter: 2 c Rye flour, 2 c warm
water, 1 pkg yeast in a glass container.  Leave at roomtemp for about
3 days stirring when you think of it.  When it starts to smell like a
brewery, you can refrigerate it. Just bring it back to room temp
before you use it. Adapted from BREAD MACHINE BAKING, Brody & Apter
