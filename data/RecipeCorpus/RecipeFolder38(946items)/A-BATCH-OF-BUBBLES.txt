Mix all ingredients in a flat container such as a dishpan or baking
pan. You can make bubbles with purchased wands, but it's much more
fun to make your own bubble blowers from items you find around the
house. For example, poke the bottom out of a paper cup and dip the
end in the mixture; also try a slotted spoon, a plastic berry basket,
and drinking straws.
