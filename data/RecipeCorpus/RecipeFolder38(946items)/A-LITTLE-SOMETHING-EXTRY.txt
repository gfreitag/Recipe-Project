Dress the meat (hopefully it will come to you this way and you won't
have to do it yourself).  Soak fore one (1) hour in mild vinegar and
water to remove the gamey taste; drain. Cut the meat in serving size
pieces as you would chicken, salt and pepper the meat, cover with
water. Add the seasoning and boil until partially tender. Remove from
the heat and drain. Brown the meat in a small amount of shortening
then place in a roasting pan.  Make a thin brown gravy with flour and
meat drippings; pour over the meat.  Place peeled sweet potatoes
around the meat and bake at 350 degrees until the potatoes are done.
Good luck.
