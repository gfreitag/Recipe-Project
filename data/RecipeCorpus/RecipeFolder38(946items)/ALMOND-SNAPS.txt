1/2 c  Margarine or butter
1/3 c  Corn syrup
1 c  Ground almonds
1/2 c  Flour
2 tb Water
Line a cookie sheet with foil and grease it. Set aside. In a small
saucepan combine brown sugar, margarine and corn syrup. Cook over
medium heat until margarine is melted and mixture smooth. Remove from
heat and stir in almonds, flour and water. Drop by rounded teaspoons
onto cookie sheet. Bake only 3 or 4 at a time in a 350 F oven for 6
to 8 minutes.Let stand on cookie sheet about 2 minutes. Immediately
remove cookies one at a time and roll around a metal cone, cool on
wire racks. Instead of using a metal cone for shaping you can use a
greased wooden spoon handle or make a cone from pliable cardboard. If
cookies become too hard before you get them shaped, return to oven
for about 30 seconds.
