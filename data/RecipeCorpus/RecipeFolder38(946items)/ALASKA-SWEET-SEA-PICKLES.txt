Categories: Condiments, Holidays
Yield: 1 Servings
4 lb Bulb kelp
1 c  Salt
2 ga Water
1/2 ts Alum
2 qt Water
3 1/2 c  Sugar
1 pt White vinegar
1/2 ts Oil of cloves
1/2 ts Oil of cinnamon
Cut kelp in 12 inch lengths and split bulbs.  Remove dark surface
layer with a vegetable parer.  Soak 2 hours in brine solution
prepared by dissolving 1 cup salt in 2 gallons water. Care must be
taken to keep kelp covered with brine.  Remove kelp from brine and
wash thoroughly with cold water.

Cut kelp into 1 inch cubes and soak in alum solution (1/2 teaspoon
alum to 2 quarts water) for 15 minutes. Drain and wash in cold water;
drain again. Place in enamel kettle and cover with boiling water.
Cook only until kelp can be pierced with a fork.  Drain.

Combine sugar, vinegar and oils; boil 2 minutes; pour over cooked
kelp. Let stand ovenight in an enamel kettle or crock. In the morning
drain off syrup and reheat to boiling point. Pour back over kelp and
allow to stand 24 hours.  The third morning, heat both kelp and syrup
to boiling point. Pack in hot sterilized jars and seal while hot.

NOTE:  The giant kelp is easily recognized by the floating bulb
attached to a long, hollow stem rooted to the bottom of a shallow bay
or channel. Gather during June, July and August when the kelp is in
its prime. Use only the ones rooted to the bottom.  The kelp is
washed, peeled and used the same as green tomatoes or cucumbers for
pickles and relishes.
