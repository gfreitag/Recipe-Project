1/2    Stick butter
2 c  Crawfish tails -- ground
2 c  Cooked long-grain rice
1/2 c  Bell pepper -- chopped
2 sl Bacon; crisp -- crumble
1 tb Parsley -- chop fine
1/2 c  Shallots -- chop fine
1/4 ts Basil
ds Thyme 1 ts Salt ds Tabasco 3    Eggs; well beaten Mix crawfish
tails, rice, bell pepper, bacon, parsley, shallots, basil, thyme,
salt and Tabasco together well. Pour the eggs over the mixture and
blend them into the rice mixture. Let mixture "set" in the fridge for
about 30 minutes, covered. Melt butter in skillet or griddle. Then,
keeping your hands moist with a few drops of water shape the mixture
into small squares, about 3x3x1/2" and plop them on the griddle. They
will sizzle nicely and turn light brown in a few minutes. Flip over
and fry until brown. Source: The Frank Davis Seafood Notebook (wrv)
