MMMMM--------------------HEAT SCALE - MEDIUM-------------------------
Combine all ingredients in a non-reactive heavy saucepan, allow to
steep for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Bring mixture to a low
and gentle boil while stirring continuously. Remove saucepan from
heat and allow to cool thoroughly. Strain through a very fine sieve
and pour the strained oil into a bottle and cap tightly. This oil
will remain up to 6 months if it is refrigerated and capped tightly.
This is a MEDIUM HOT condiment.
This oil is used both to color and to flavor dishes. Use it in
place of vegetable oil for South American recipes. Use only annatto
(achiote) seeds that are bright-reddish in color; seeds that are
brownish are old and have probably lost much of their flavor.
