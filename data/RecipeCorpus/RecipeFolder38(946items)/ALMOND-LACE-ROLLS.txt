Title: ALMOND LACE ROLLS
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Servings
3/4 c  Unblanched almonds,*
1/2 c  Butter
1/2 c  Sugar
1 tb (rounded) flour
1 tb Heavy cream
1 tb Milk
* finely ground

These cookies require precision timing and fast action but the
results are worth the trouble. I make them for holidays and special
occasions, but they are delicious anytime.

Preheat oven to 350ø. Butter and flour baking sheet.

In a small, heavy pan, place all ingredients. Cook over low heat,
stirring constantly until butter melts. Drop by teaspoonful: onto
baking sheet (do not bake more than six at one time).

Bake at 350ø for 7-9 minutes. Cookies should be only slightly brown
and still bubbling at the center. Let cool only for a minute or so
until the edge is firm enough to lift with a thin spatula Then,
working quickly, lift cookies and turn them top side down onto paper
towels. Roll over the handle of a wooden spoon to get a cylinder
shape and let cool until crisp.

Use a fresh cookie sheet for each baking to avoid cookies sticking on
sheet. If cookies get too firm to roll over the spoon handle, place
back in the oven for a few moments.

Store cookies in an airtight cookie jar or tin. They will keep for a
long time, and can be made well ahead of the holiday season.

Variations: These cookies also can be left flat-make them smaller if
you do that; however, they don't have the flair of the rolled lacy
effect. Or roll ends of cooled cookies in melted chocolate.
