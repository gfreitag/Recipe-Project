Title: ALMOND NOUGAT
Categories: Candies
Yield: 2 Servings
1 1/2 c  Light corn syrup
2 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Water
2    Egg whites
1/2 ts Almond extract
Red or green food coloring
1/4 c  Soft butter or margarine
1 c  Toasted chopped almonds
1/4 c  Chopped candied cherries
DIRECTIONS: Mix first 4 ingredients in heavy saucepan. Cook, stirring,
until sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, until a small
amount of the mixture dropped in cold water forms a hard ball
(250-F). Beat egg whites until stiff, but not dry, in large bowl of
electric mixer. Gradually beat in about one fourth (not more) of the
syrup, and continue beating until mixture holds its shape. Cook
remaining syrup until a small amount of mixture separates into hard
and brittle threads when dropped in cold water (300-F). Gradually
beat into first mixture, and continue beating until the mixture
begins to hold its shape. Add flavoring and food coloring to tint a
delicate shade. Beat in butter; continue beating until very thick and
satiny. Stir in nuts and cherries. Press into a buttered 8x8x2" pan,
smoothing top. Let stand until firm. Turn out of pan, and cut in 1
1/2" by 1" pieces. Wrap each piece individually in waxed paper. For
best flavor, store several days in a cool place before serving.
