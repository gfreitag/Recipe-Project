In a skillet, melt bacon grease over medium heat. Saute meat, onion,
garlic tomatoes, chilies and potatoes until the onion softens. Add
salt, oregano, chili powder and cilantro; simmer 2-3 minutes. Place a
scant 1/2 cup meat filling on each tortilla. Fold, envelope-style,
like a burrito. Fry seam side down, in 1/2 inch of hot oil (360-375
degrees) until crispy and brown. Turn and brown other side. Drain
briefly on a paper towel. Place on a serving plate and top with
shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, guacamole and salsa. Place
shredded lettuce next to chimichanga and top with tomatoes and
olives. Serve immediately. Yield: 12 servings. Though still debated.
Tuscon is generally credited as the original home of the chimichanga
(a fried "burro", as we call them, stuffed with meat, onions and
chilies).  I've combined several recipes into this one, and it's
fairly authentic.
