The following four recipes are from a Chron article called "Foreign
Intrigue" by Alice Cuneo that featured recipes from various
consulates in the City.  This first one is from the Consulate of the
People's Republic of China.  It's a sophisticated (but uncomplicated)
banquet dish featuring abalone, shrimp and porkfat.

Abalone stuffed with minced shrimp, from Shen Xuliang of the Chinese
consulate.

Trim the abalone, removing rough parts, and cut into flat rounds. Chop
shrimp and fat pork to a paste consistency; stir in the water
chestnuts, chives and ginger water. Season with salt and MSG.

Create the abalone "sandwiches" by spreading an abalone round with
shrimp paste, then topping with another round. Dredge "sandwiches" in
maize flour and set aside.

Heat chive and ginger oil in a wok over medium heat, swirling the oil
to coat all sides of the wok.

Dip the abalone "sandwiches" in the flour, then in eggs. Fry in the
hot oil until abalone is tender and golden. Add Shaoxing wine,
chicken stock, salt and MSG. Bring to a simmer, adjust the seasonings
and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.  Serve immediately.

NOTE:  Chive and ginger oil is oil in which chives and ginger have
been cooked.  To make at home, heat 4 ounces oil in a wok set over
medium heat. Toss in 1 or 2 tablespoons fresh snipped chives and 3
slices fresh ginger. Stir-fry until fragrant, then proceed with
recipe. (Remove ginger slices before serving.)

Ginger water is available in Chinese markets.
