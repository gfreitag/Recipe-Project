Title: ABLESKIVER (PANCAKE BALLS)
Categories: Swedish
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Sifted flour
2 tb Sugar
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Cardamom
3/4 ts Salt
Combine:
1 c  Thick sour cream
2/3 c  Milk
3    Egg yolks, beaten
2 tb Melted butter
Set an ableskiver pan over low heat

Sift together and set aside:

Make a well in center of dry ingredients.  Add liquid mixture all at
one time, stirring until well blended.

Beat until rounded peaks are formed:  3 egg whites. Gently spread
batter over egg whites and fold together.

Test ableskiver pan by dropping on it a few drops of cold water; if
drops dance around in small beads, temperature is right. Grease well
with butter (About
1/2    tsp. per well)

Pour batter into wells, filling about one half full. With a fork turn
ableskivers frequently to brown evenly. Do not pierce. Ableskivers
are done when a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Serve
immediately sprinkled with Confectioners' sugar.  If desired,
accompany with a tart jam.  About 4 doz. balls.
