This winning recipe is from Mila Tomisek of Chicago. She prefers to
use unsalted butter, but says margarine can be substituted. The
cookies are very fragile.
Mila first began baking these small, buttery, crescent-shaped
cookies with her grandmother during World War I; today, at 82, she
still bakes them for her children and grandchildren. from the Chicago
