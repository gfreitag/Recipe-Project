Title: ALMONNAISE
Categories: Vegetarian, Try it
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Almonds, blanched
1/4 c  Soy milk
1 ts Nutritional yeast
1/4 ts Garlic powder
1/4 ts Seasoned salt
1/4 c  Soy milk
1 1/4 c  Oil, sunflower
3 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Cider vinegar
Water can be substituted for soy milk.
Process almonds to fine powder in blender or food processor. Add soy
milk, yeast, garlic powder, and salt. Blend well, then add remaining
soy milk to form smooth cream.
With blender running on low, remove insert in top and drizzle in oil
in thin stream until mixture is thick. Keep blender running and add
lemon juice and vinegar. Blend on low for 1 minute longer, to allow
mixture to thicken to desired consistency.
Refrigerate tightly sealed; this will keep 10-14 days in
refrigerator.
Yields 1-1/2 to 2 cups Note: Do not be discouraged if, on occasion,
your Almonnaise does not thicken to your expectations. Homemade
mayonnaise products are among the most sensitive to prepare, and
sometimes they just don't respond.  This recipe has been made
successfully by many people, but once in a while it fails even for me
[the author of The American Vegetarian Cookbook].  For every failure,
however, I've had hundreds of successes that make it worth the small
risk.
