Recipe by: Rachel Hosford Spence --ALASKA <JSRKH@ACAD1.ALASKA.EDU>
Mix the refried beans and taco seasoning together (I also mix the
chili's in with this, but some people put the chilis as a layer) Mix
this really well (I used a food processor, but today I am going to
use my mixer). This is the first layer.

Put a layer of sour cream on top of the refried beans, taco seasoning
and chilis.

Next put a layer of well mixed/mushed avacados (you need enough to
cover the pan, I use a cake pan normally) on top of everything else

Next sprinkle cheeses on top (I just thought about it and I put the
avacado first and then the sour cream, but I suppose it doesnt
matter). I think the more cheese the better myself *grin*!

Next cut up tomatoes and add as many as you like, which I like to use
at least 2 cut up tomatoes.

Last put chopped up olives.

Put in the oven until the cheese is melted. I use a low heat so that
everyt else warms up.

Last but not least pull out the chips and dip! Everyone really enjoys
this dip. I hope you do too.
