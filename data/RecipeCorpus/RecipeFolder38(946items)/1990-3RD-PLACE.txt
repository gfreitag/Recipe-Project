Title: 1990 3RD PLACE: SHORTBREAD SHEEP
Categories: Cookies, Holiday
Yield: 16 Servings
2 c  Unsalted softened butter
1 c  Sugar
4 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time: 20 to 25 minutes

1. Cream butter and sugar in large mixer bowl until light and
fluffy. Beat in flour and salt. Knead the dough briefly until smooth.
If dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour. (Dough can be
refrigerated up to several days; soften slightly before shaping
cookies.)

2. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready.

3. Pat half of the dough out on lightly floured surface to 1/2 -inch
thickness. Use cookie cutters to cut out desired shapes. Place
cookies 2 inches apart on baking sheets. Bake until light brown on
edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
Note: The sheep cookie cutter used by Koenig is a Hallmark cutter
that is no longer available. A sheep pattern can be made out of
cardboard and placed over dough; cut out the shape with a small knife.

Third prize went to Betty J. Koenig, of Hammond, Ind., for her
recipe for shortbread cookies in the shape of sheep. Betty uses a
sheep cookie cutter to make these cookies. She suggests using your
fingertips to dimple the dough to resemble their wooly coats. If
desired, a small piece of chocolate can be used for eyes after
baking. Chicago Tribune, December 13, 1990 from the Chicago Tribune
