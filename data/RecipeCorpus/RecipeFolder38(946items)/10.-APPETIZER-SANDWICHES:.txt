Title: 10. APPETIZER SANDWICHES:
Categories: Appetizers, Oddball, Quick
Yield: 1 Servings
1 cn Asparagus (long stems)
1    Loaf
Butter
Mayonaise
Salt and pepper
GOOD square white bread
carefully remove asparagas spears from tin, spread on towel to drain
for at least two hours ;(if some are very "fat" split in half.

remove crusts from bread

carefully spread each square with butter, and then spread carefully
and generously with mayonaise.

take a spear and put diagonal on bread - sprinkle generously with S &
P

roll from corner to make a tube.  I then cut the tube in half to make
smaller portions - your choice

pile in bowl or on plate, cover with aluminum foil (putting in
Tupperware doesn't seem to have the same effect, who knows why)

Refrigerate for several hours.

Remove from frig at least 1/2 hour before serving.

So - easy right - make it in the morning - and the 1/2 hour out of
frig is while you're driving to the party ... every party I took
these two they were the first thing gone, men, kids, everyone said,
these are weird, humm but good!
