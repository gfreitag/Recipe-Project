MMMMM---------------------YIELD: 6 SERVINGS--------------------------
1/2 c  Onion; slice
10 cl Garlic; slice thin
2 c  Carrots; slice thin
1 c  Water
3 ea Tb Corn oil
1 ts Ground Tumeric
1 ea Fresh hot green peppers;
-halve to 3 peppers
1 lb Cabbage; chop coarse
I'd substitute dry berebere. In dry pan over moderate low heat, stir
fry onion, garlic, and carrots for 2 mins. Add 1/2c of the water and
cook 5 mins longer. Add the oil and continue to simmer. Add the
tumeric, chilies, and cabbage. Cover the pan and steam to reduce the
bulk for 2 mins. Stir well and add the quemam, tomato paste, salt and
the potatoes. Cover the pan and cook for 5 mins. Add the remaining
water and simmer for 5 minutes more to soften the potatoes and
thicken the sauce somewhat. Serve at room temperature with Injeera.
