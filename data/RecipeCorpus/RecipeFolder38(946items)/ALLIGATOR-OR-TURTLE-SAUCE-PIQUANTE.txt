oil to make a roux. Add vegetables and tomato paste and cook slowly
for 30-40 minutes. Add chunks of alligator meat with enough boiling
water to cover. Boil down for 30 minutes. Add celery, shallots, green
peppers, bay leaves, Allspice, sugar and Chinese vegetables. The last
ingredients give a nice body to the roux, particularly the crunchy
water chestnuts. If desired, sherry or red wine may also be added to
the sauce. Raise heat and thicken. Add sliced lemon and butter just
before serving. This recipe for sauce piquante may be used for many
other kinds of meats. Festival: Kliebert's Annual Alligator Day;
