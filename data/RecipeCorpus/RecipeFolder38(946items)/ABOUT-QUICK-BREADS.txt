As their name suggests, quick breads are just that-fast and very easy
to make. Quick breads range from pancakes to tender, flaky biscuits
to moist, rich nut breads.

Quick-acting baking powder rather than slower-acting yeast is the
leavening agent for quick breads. It consists of an acid, such as
cream of tartar, and an alkali, such as baking soda, which react with
one another in the presence of moisture to form a gas. In batter or
dough this gas forms tiny bubbles that expand quickly, creating the
structure of the quick bread. To be sure it is always fresh, purchase
only a small quantity of baking powder at a time.

BAKING TIPS

Use shiny pans and cookie sheets, which reflect heat, for golden,
delicate and tender crusts on muffins, coffee cakes and nut breads.

Grease only the bottoms of muffin cups; muffins will then be nicely
shaped and have no rim around the top edge.

Grease only the bottoms of loafpans for fruit or nut breads. The
ungreased sides provide a surface for the batter to cling to while
rising during baking, which helps form a gently rounded top.

Cool nut breads completely before slicing to prevent crumbling. Cut
with a sharp, thin-bladed knife, using a light sawing motion.
