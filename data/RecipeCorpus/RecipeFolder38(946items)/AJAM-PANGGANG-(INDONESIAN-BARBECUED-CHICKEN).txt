Title: AJAM PANGGANG (INDONESIAN BARBECUED CHICKEN)
Categories: Fruits, Harned 1994, Indonesian, Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Broiler chicken
1 c  Kecap (or ketjap) manis*
2    Garlic cloves
-- peeled and mashed
2 tb Fresh lime juice
1/2 c  Melted, unsalted butter
1/2 ts Grated fresh ginger
1 ts Sambal oelek**
1 pk Kroepoek oedang***
Cornstarch to thicken
-- marinade for sauce
*Sweet soy sauce.

**Hot pepper sauce.

***Shrimp puffs.

Note:  Ingredients from Indonesia are available at many Dutch,
Chinese, Vietnamese and Indonesian specialty stores. This...dish is
good with Nasi Goreng (fried rice).

Cut chicken into 8 pieces.  Combine remaining ingredients, except
shrimp puffs, in large bowl.  Add chicken pieces; toss to coat.
Marinate 2 hours at room temperature, stirring occasionally. Remove
chicken pieces from marinade (reserving some of the marinade for
basting and the rest for sauce).

Roast, uncovered, at 400 F. for 35 to 40 minutes or until done,
basting as needed.  If browning too quickly, cover with foil. (In
summer, barbecue over charcoal fire.)

Heat reserved marinade with cornstarch until thickened and serve as
sauce, if desired.  Serve with shrimp puffs on the side. For these,
simply deep-fry in hot fat or oil (375 F. on fat thermometer),
draining at once on paper towels.  The chips will puff up as soon as
they hit the fat.

Yield: 4 servings on its own, 6 as part of an Indonesian rice table.
