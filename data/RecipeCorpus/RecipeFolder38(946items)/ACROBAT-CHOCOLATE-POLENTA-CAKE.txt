Title: ACROBAT CHOCOLATE POLENTA CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 8 Servings
12 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
3/4 lb Sweet butter
8    Egg yolks
1 c  Brown sugar
1/3 c  White sugar
1/3 c  Ground almonds
1 tb All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Cornmeal
8    Egg whites
1 tb Cream of tartar
In a large saucepan over very low heat, melt chocolate. Add butter,
stir until melted and remove from heat (the mixture should be body
temperature, not too hot to touch with a finger). In a large bowl,
combine egg yolks, brown and white sugar, and stir until well mixed.
Add the chocolate, and stir well until combined. In a small bowl,
combine almonds, flour and cornmeal, stir until well mixed. Pour this
into the chocolate and stir until combined. In a large bowl with an
electric mixer, beat the egg whites with cream of tartar until they
form stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into the chocolate in three
batches.  Chef Dale Nichols warns that folding egg whites into
chocolate takes a real knack and suggests using your hand as the
paddle.  To do this by hand, use your hand as a paddle and push your
palm down to the centre of the bowl, and slide up the side of the
bowl and turn your hand over. Do not over-mix or you will knock the
air out of the egg whites causing a much denser texture. Bake in a
buttered, floured 10 inch spring form pan for 5 minutes at 400F.
Reduce heat to 350F and bake for another 20 to 30 minutes, or until
cake tests done in the centre. Let cool completely before removing
from pan.
