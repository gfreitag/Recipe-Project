TO PREPARE THE DIPPING SAUCE:  In a small bowl, add water, fish
sauce, lime juice, sugar, and chilies; stir until the sugar
dissolves.  Sprinkle with the chopped peanuts.

TO PREPARE THE SPRING BUNDLES:  In a large bowl (at least 9- inches in
diameter), place the rice vermicelli.  Add enough hot water to cover
and let soak for until soft, 10 minutes.  Drain in a colander and set
aside. Add 2-inches of warm water to the same bowl.  Immerse 1 rice
paper round. Let soften for 20 seconds and remove to work surface.
Scatter a few mint leaves in the center of rice paper.  Top with 2
shrimp halves. Layer on 2 tablespoons of the softened vermicelli, 1
tablespoon of the beans sprouts, and 3 tablespoon of the shredded
lettuce leaves. Fold the top and bottom edges of the rice paper over
the filling. Then fold over the both sides to enclose the filling in
a rectangular "bundle" (the edges will stick together).  Place
seam-side down and cover with a damp towel. Repeat with the remaining
rice papers and filling.

TO SERVE:  Line each of serving plates with 2 of the lettuce leaves.
Top with 2 of the filled spring bundles, 1/4 of the julienned
carrots, and 1 or 2 of the cilantro sprigs.

TO EAT:  Wrap each bundle in a lettuce leave with a few pieces of the
carrot and cilantro leaves.  Dip into the dipping sauce.
