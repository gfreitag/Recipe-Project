Assembly: =========

Using a broad-bladed sandwich spreader, mound the shrimp on the
bread slice to a thickness of a scant 3/4 inch, tapering the mound
where it meets the edge of the brad to form a smooth dome.

Sprinkle some sesame seeds and ham bits thinly on top, then
press on a single coriander leaf.

Deep-fry, topping side down, in 350 F oil until the topping is
golden, about 4 minutes.

Using long cooking chopsticks or tongs, turn the toasts to brown
the underside of the baguette.

Remove promptly to paper towels to drain.  Serve with warm or
cooled plum sauce.

** This plum sauce can be made from pureed soft plums simmered
with sugar, rice vinegar and plum wine to taste.
