Title: Barry's Dark Chocolate Pudding
Categories: Desserts, Chocolate, Puddings
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Cornstarch
1 ts Vanilla
1/8 ts Salt
3 tb Butter or Margarine
3 c  Milk
3/4 c  Hershey's European Style
Cocoa
3/4 c  Sugar
Mix all ingredients together, stirring until chocolate is dissolved.

Place mixture in the top part of a double boiler (have water boiling
at start of cooking) Stir continuously until pudding is thick and
smooth. Cook for several minutes longer. Pour into serving dishes or
cups and refrigerate.  This pudding is also excellent served hot.

If you are a chocoholic like me, and in a hurry, you can cook it
directly on the stove stirring constantly so it doesn't stick or
burn, and it cooks a little faster.

Be sure to use the european style cocoa as it is a "Dutch-Processed"
cocoa that has a richer flavor and darker color.
