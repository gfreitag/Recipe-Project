Title: About Tongue
Categories: Meats, Information
Yield: 1 text file  The most desired, in order of preference, are: calf, lamb, beef and
pork. All are tasty. They can be purchased fresh, smoked and pickled.
To prepare: scrub the tongue well. If it is smoked or pickled you MAY
wish to blanch it first, by simmering for about 10 minutes. Immerse
the tongue in seasoned boiling water to cover, reduce heat and simmer
gently for at least one hour and up to 3 hours for large beef
tongues. Then drain, plunge into cold water to cool the meat enough
to handle, skin it and trim any bones and gristle from the root.
Finally return it to the cooking water to re-heat it before serving.
Or chill it entirely and serve as a cold-cut. To carve, start by
cutting through the hump parallel to the base, but towards the tip
cut an the diagonal for a better looking presentation. It is
excellent served with mustard sauces, devilled mayonnaise,
horseradish,dill pickles and pickled beets or just a generous
sprinkling of salt and freshly ground pepper.
