spinning, add garlic, chiles and dried shrimp powder, if using. Add
the lime-juice mixture and process until smooth. Transfer the
dressing to a bowl; add tomatoes and a handful of the carrots. Use a
large flat spoon to press and mash the tomatoes and carrots into the
dressing.  Gradually add the remaining carrots until the salad is
fully blended.  (The salad can be prepared ahead to this point and
stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.) Line a platter
with lettuce, place cabbage wedges around the edge, mound the carrot
salad in the center and serve. 68 calories per serving: 2 g protein,
