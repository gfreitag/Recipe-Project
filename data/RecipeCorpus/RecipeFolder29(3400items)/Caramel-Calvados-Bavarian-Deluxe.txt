Title: Caramel Calvados Bavarian Deluxe
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 10 servings
-Cream
4 c  Macedoine of Fruit
2    Recipes of Ladyfingers
1    Recipe of Caramel Bavarian
This dessert is an assembly of three recipes. Two days before dessert
day prepare a macedoine of very tart apples such as green
Grannysmiths , sugar and Calvados or other fine apple brandy. Add a
little lemon or ascorbic acid to keep the apples from browning. Also
prepare 2 recipes of Ladyfingers and store uncovered to allow them to
go slightly stale. You will also need 3/4 cup Caramelized sugar made
ahead for the Bavarian cream.

One day  before prepare a batch of Caramel Bavarian cream using
Calvados rather than rum as the flavoring but do not leave it long
enough to set, just slightly thickened. Sprinkle a little more
Calvados on the stale Ladyfingers to moisten slightly. Line the
bottom and sides of a mold with them. Decorate the centre with apple
slices. The pudding will be inverted when it is unmolded and these
apples will show on the top of the finished dessert.

Then build a pattern of alternating Bavarian mixture, Calvados-apple
Macedoine and dry ladyfinger crumbs, starting and ending with the
cream. Make a pattern of Ladyfingers on the top.

Refrigerate and chill at least 12 hours before unmolding.
