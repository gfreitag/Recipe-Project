minutes more.

Meanwhile, slowly heat the salt pork in a large skillet so that the
fat is rendered. Raise the heat to medium high, add the onions and
saut for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the celery and carrots and
continue to cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes more. Add the
vegetables and the spice bag, stir in the thyme and sage and cook for
another hour.

Remove and discard the spice bag and the ham hock, if used. Pure the
soup in batches in a food processor, and return to the pot after
pureing. if the soup is too thick, add more water for desired
consistency. Reheat soup over low heat, stir in the cayenne, wine,
tomato paste, vinegar and molasses and simmer for 3 minutes more.

Taste for salt and add if necessary. When ready to serve, ladle the
soup into serving bowls and sprinkle with some chopped egg white.
Float a slice of lime on the surface of  each bowl and sprinkle with
a little minced parsley.

Note: if cured ham is used, pure it with the soup.
