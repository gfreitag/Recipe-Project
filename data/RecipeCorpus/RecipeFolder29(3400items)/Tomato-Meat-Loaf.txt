Title: Tomato Meat Loaf
Categories: Meats, Herbs/spice
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM------------------------SERVINGS: 4-----------------------------
1/4 c  Onion, finely chopped
4 tb Catsup
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1 ts Sugar
1 lb Beef **
1 c  Cereal, whole wheat flakes
1 ea Egg, beaten
1 c  Milk
1 tb Horseradish
** Use ground round or chuck, or a mixture of ground beef and ground
pork. Or be real decadent and use 1/3 each ground beef, pork, and
veal- delicious! My notes: I usually triple the recipe, which makes
just the right amount to nearly fill 2 meat loaf pans. I freeze the
extra meat loaf for another meal. Defrost several hours- leave
covered with aluminum foil if still partially frozen. Increase baking
time and remove foil during last half hour. Combine all ingredients
except 3 Tbsp catsup. Pack in a greased or oiled 7-1/2 x 3-1/2 x
2-1/2 inch loaf pan. Spread remaining catsup (using more, if desired)
over top. Bake at 375-F for 1-1/4 hours. Gravy may be made from the
pan juices, if desired. My notes: I usually just serve this with
baked potatoes, using the pan juices as is. Leftovers make delicious
sandwiches- just spread with a little more catsup. From Sallie Krebs
