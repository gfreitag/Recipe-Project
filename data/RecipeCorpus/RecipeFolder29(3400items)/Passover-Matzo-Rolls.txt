PASSOVER MATZO ROLLS
====================
This recipe comes from a poster-sized sheet of recipes printed by
Manischewitz many years ago (probably before I was born). Besides
making reasonably good mock "rolls," it's also great fun for kids to
make (very sticky!). INGREDIENTS (Makes 12) 2 c matzah meal 1 ts salt
1 tb sugar 1 c water 1/2 c peanut oil 4 ea eggs PROCEDURE: (1)
Combine matzah meal with salt and sugar. (2) In a medium saucepan,
bring oil and water to a boil. (3) Remove the saucepan from the heat
and add the matzah meal,mixing well. (4) Beat in the eggs thoroughly,
one at a time (this is where it starts to get sticky).  Let the
mixture stand for about 15 minutes (can be refrigerated). (5) With
well-oiled hands, shape it into rolls and place on a well-greased
cookie sheet (you will have to keep re-oiling your hands). (6) Bake
in a preheated 375 deg. F degree oven for 50 minutes or until golden
brown. RATING: Difficulty: easy. Time: 35 minutes preparation
(including waiting),50 minutes baking. Precision: measure the
ingredients. CONTRIBUTOR: Tovah HollanderUCLA Comprehensive Epilepsy
