Soak the porcini mushrooms in 1 1/2 c of warm water for at least 30

liquid for use elsewhere.  Squeeze the porcini & wash in fresh water.
Cut into very fine pieces.

Clean fresh mushrooms with a damp cloth & dice them.  Place in a
medium- sized bowl.  Add the porcini, tomatoes, rosemary, sage,
garlic & pepper. Mix together well.  Toss with the lemon juice & oil.
Cover & leave for 24 hours.

Just before serving, add the salt.  If it seems to be too moist, then
drain off the extra moisture.

Use as an appetizer salad or as a topping fro grilled bread.  Or
omit, the lemon & use as a pasta sauce.
