CLASSIC CHALLAH
===============
MAKES 3 SMALL OR 1 LARGE
-CHALLAH
2 ea Pk Active Dry Yeast
2 c  Warm Water (110 to 115F)
1/4 c  Sugar (plus a pinch)
Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup of the warm water with a pinch of
sugar. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat together the remaining
1 1/2 cups warm water, 1/4 cup sugar, oil, salt, and the yeast
mixture. Add 3 of the eggs and blend well. Add the flour, 1 cup at a
time, blending after each addition, until the dough is thick enough
to work by hand, 4 to 5 cups. Spoon the dough out on a floured board
and knead for 5 to 10 minutes, adding additional flour to make a
smooth and elastic dough. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, and oil
the top of the dough. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place
until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down the dough, turn
it over, cover, and let it rise 30 minutes longer. Divide the dough
into 3 parts. Divide each part into 3 parts. This will make 3
individual challahs. Form each part into a long rope. Pinch together
one end of each of the 3 ropes and braid the ropes, pinching the
other ends together. To shape for Rosh Hashanah (round challah):
Using one third of the dough, form into a large rope, 12 to 15 inches
long and several inches thick. Starting in the center, begin making
concentric circles of the rope until a large snail-shaped is created.
Seal ends. Place the round challah in a large cake pan, oiled and
generously sprinkled with cornmeal. Place the individual challahs on
baking sheets or in bread pans lightly greased and generously
sprinkled with corneal. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm
place until doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375F. Brush with
the remaining egg, lightly beaten, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on racks.
