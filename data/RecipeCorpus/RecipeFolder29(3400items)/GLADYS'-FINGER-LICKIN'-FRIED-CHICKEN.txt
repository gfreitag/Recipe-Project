- it's key to the taste)
WASH FRYER PIECES; pat dry with paper towels. Combine flour, salt and
pepper in large plastic bag. Shake pieces to coat well. Heat oil in
large 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add chicken
pieces, being careful not to crowd pan. (It may be necessary to cook
chicken in batches). Decrease heat to medium. Cook, uncovered, until
well browned on underside, about 15 minutes. Use tongs to turn. Cook,
uncovered, until browned on underside, about 12-15 minutes. Transfer
chicken to double-thickness of paper towels to blot excess fat.
