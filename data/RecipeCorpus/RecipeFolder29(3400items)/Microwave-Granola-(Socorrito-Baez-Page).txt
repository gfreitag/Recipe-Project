1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Butter
1/2 c  Honey
3 c  Oats (rolled or oatmeal work
-fine)
3/4 c  Shelled sunflower seeds
Microwave butter in large bowl on HIGH until melted (30 secs or so.)
Add honey.  Mix oats, nuts, seeds, wheat germ, and sugar. (You can
vary the nuts and use more or different dried fruits like dates,
coconut, prunes, currants, almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, or whatever.)
Mix well with butter. Microwave on HIGH 2 mins and stir. Microwave 1
min and stir. Add raisins or other fruit. Microwave 1 min on HIGH til
toasty, then stir. Spread on cookie sheet or clean counter until
cool.  Store in tightly covered container.

When cooking, do not use butterscotch, chocolate, or peanut butter
chips as they will just melt and gum up the cereal.  Just toss them
in after cooling if you like. From: Kristin Tremayne Date: 18 Jan 95
