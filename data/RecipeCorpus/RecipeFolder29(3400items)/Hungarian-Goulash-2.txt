Heat the oil in a stockpot.  Place onions in the heated oil and
sprinkle paprika over them.  Saute the onions and paprika for about 3
minutes to draw out their flavors.  Add the meat cubes and brown them
for 5 to 6 minutes, carefully turning cubes so they brown on all
sides. Make sure they mix well with the paprika and onions.  Remove
the meat mixture to a side dish.  Deglaze the pan by adding 3/4 cup
of the water and mixing it with the drippings in the pan.  Return
sure the meat mixture to the stockpot and add the remaining 3/4 cup
water, broth, salt, and marjoram. Make sure the meat is covered with
liquid. If not, add more water. Cover stockpot and simmer the goulash
for 1 hour over low heat. Add more water as needed to keep meat
covered. After 1 hour add the bell pepper strips and tomatoes. Cover
and continue more simmering 7 to 8 minutes more, stirring
occasionally.  The meat should be tender and slice easily.  Garnish
each individual bowl or one large tureen of goulash with caraway
seeds, and serve.  (Goes well with new potatoes and rice as well as
dumplings.) Tastes good with a dollop of sour cream. Food Exchanges
