Title: Apple Cheddar Pie
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 8 servings
6 oz Shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 c  Ice water
8 c  Peeled, sliced apples
-- (about 8 medium apples)
2/3 c  Sugar
3/4 ts Cinnamon
2 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Enriched Corn Meal
-- (Aunt Jemima or Quaker)
1 ts Salt (optional)
1/3 c  Margarine or butter; plus...
2 tb Margarine or butter
1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
Combine 2 cups flour, corn meal and salt.  Cut in 1/3 cup margarine
and shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in cheese.
Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring lightly until mixture
forms a ball. Divide dough into 2 parts, 1 slightly larger; shape
each to form ball. Wrap securely in plastic wrap or wax paper; chill
about 30 minutes. Roll large ball on lightly floured surface to form
11-inch circle. Fit loosely into 9-inch pie plate; trim.  Roll
remaining dough to form 12-inch square. Cut into 12 x 3/4-inch
strips.*

Heat oven to 400 F.  Combine remaining 1/3 cup flour, apples, sugar
and cinnamon; spoon into crust.  Dot with remaining 2 tablespoons
margarine. Weave strips atop filling to make a lattice crust.  Trim
even with outer rim of pie plate.  Fold lower crust over strips; seal
and flute. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until crust is light golden
brown, shielding edges with aluminum foil if necessary.  Cool
slightly.

*NOTE: To make a double crust pie, roll remaining dough to form
10-inch circle instead of cutting strips.  Prepare filling as
directed. Place top crust over filling; trim.  Turn edges under;
flute. Cut slits in top crust to allow steam to escape.
