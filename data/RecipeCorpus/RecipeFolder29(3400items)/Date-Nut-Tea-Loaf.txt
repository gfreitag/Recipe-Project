Title: Date-Nut Tea Loaf
Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 1 loaf
2 c  Chopped pitted dates
8 tb Unsalted butter; softened
1/2 c  Light brown sugar
2    Extra-large eggs
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/3 c  Buttermilk
3/4 c  Chopped walnuts or pecans
2 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground allspice
Preheat the oven to 350F.  Butter and flour a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan.

Sift together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt,
cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.  Place the dates in a bowl, sprinkle
them with 1 tablespoon of the sifted mixture and mix, coating the
dates as evenly as possible.  (The dates, if they are very soft, will
clump together--just stir the flour in and around, separating the
nuggets as you go.)

Cream the butter in the large bowl of an electric mixer on moderate
speed for 3 minutes.  Add the sugar and beat on moderately high speed
for 2 minutes.  Beat in the eggs, one at a time, blending well after
each addition.  Beat in the vanilla extract.  On low speed, add half
of the sifted ingredients, the buttermilk, then the balance of the
sifted ingredients, mixing until the particles of flour are absorbed.
Stir in the dates and walnuts or pecans.

Pour and scrape the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake the cake for 1
hour, or until a wooden pick inserted into the cake emerges clean and
dry. The baked cake will pull away slightly from the sides of the pan.

Cool the cake in the pan on a rack for 4 to 5 minutes, invert onto
another rack and turn rightside up.  Cool completely.  Store in an
airtight container.
