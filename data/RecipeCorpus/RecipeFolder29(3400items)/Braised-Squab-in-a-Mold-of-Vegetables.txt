Squabs and Sauce: =================

Brown pigeon wings and neck in the oven and reserve.  This will
tend to darken the sauce and bring out the flavor of the squab bones.

Salt and pepper the squab inside and out.  In a large saute pan,
heat butter (do not use too much butter or birds will deep fry).  Add
the squabs and brown carefully on every side.  Place the birds in
warm spot.

Discard the used butter from the pan, and add four tablespoons of
fresh clarified butter.

Add bacon and onions to the pan and saute to a blond color.

Add cabbages.  Cook over low heat for twenty minutes, stirring
occasionally.

Add veal stock to cover the contents of the pan and adjust the
seasonings.  Bring to a boil.

Place the squabs on the cabbage in the saute pan then brush with
clarified butter, and cook in a 450 F for 10 minutes.

Remove the squabs from the pan, bone them and put the bones in
the saucepan with the previously cut wings and necks.  Reserve the
squab meat.

Into the saucepan with the necks, wings and bones, strain the
juice from the cabbage mixture.  Add veal stock if liquid is needed.
Reserve the cabbage.

Over medium heat, cook the strained cabbage juice and bones for
at least one-half hour, then strain through chinois and reserve the
sauce.

Vegetables and Molds: =====================

Cook the carrots, turnips, and broccoli in heavily salted water
until crisp.  Cool the vegetables in a bowl placed in ice water.

Select the largest turnip, slice it at its widest part into 4
slices, about an 1/8-inch thick and about 3 1/2 inches in diameter.
In the middle of each of these turnip slices, cut a round hole about
the size of a quarter or slightly larger.

Cut the remaining turnips and carrots into 40 rectangular slices
about 1 1/2 inch by 1 inch by 1/8 inch.

On the bottom of 4 buttered 4-inch souffle molds, place one each
of the large turnip slices.  Arrange the remaining vegetables slices
around the inside edge of the molds, alternating carrot and turnip
slices.

Place a broccoli flower, stem off and head down, into the hole
in the bottom of each mold.  This will be the centerpiece of your
mold when unmolded later.

Cover the broccoli with one layer of cabbage packed well over and
between the broccoli and vegetables.  Top this cabbage layer with a
layer of squab meat.

Add more cabbage, pressing hard to form the mixture at the top
of the mold.

Place the molds of squab and cabbage onto a small sheet pan.
Surround the molds with a little water (a 1/4-inch in depth or a
little more). Put a small sheet of buttered parchment paper on each
mold (butter side down). Reheat for 20 minutes in your oven at 450 F.

(Note: If molds are not to be cooked until a later time, they
should remain in the oven about 20 minutes on low heat before being
cooled and stored away in a refrigerator.)

Unmold on serving plates.  Spoon warmed sauce around molds and
serve.
