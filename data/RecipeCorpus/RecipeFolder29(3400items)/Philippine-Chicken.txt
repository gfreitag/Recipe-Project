Title: Philippine Chicken
Categories: Crockpot, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Soy sauce
2    Garlic cloves; chopped
6    Chicken Breasts, skinned
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Vinegar
Put in crockpot. Cook for 6 to 8 hrs on LOW. Serve over rice. The
original recipe used 1 chicken, cut up.

Gaye's Notes: I used frozen, boneless chicken breasts straight from
the freezer and reduced the water to 3/4 cup. This is the best "new"
recipe I have tried in ages.
