Categories: Countyfairs, Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
& Sliced
1 tb Butter, melted
Topping
1 c  All-Purpose Flour
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Baking Powder
2 1/2 ts Butter
3/4 c  Milk
1 c  Brown Sugar, firmly packed
1/4 c  All-Purpose Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Cider Vinegar
1 c  Water
1/2 ts Ground Cinnamon
1 ts Vanilla Extract
6 c  Apples, Peeled, Cored
* Preheat oven to 375 F.

1. Put brown sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and 1/4 tsp salt in a 1-qt
nonaluminum saucepan. Add the vinegar and water and cook over
moderate heat, stiring constantly, until thick. Remove from heat and
let stand until comfortable to the touch. When cool, stir cinnamon,
vanilla and butter into the spiced syrup.

2. Generously butter a 7 x 11-inch (6-cup) glass baking dish or its
equal. Arrange the apple slices in it. Pour the spiced syrup over the
apples.

3. Make the topping. Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder together.
Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal, then stir
in the milk just until combined. Drop by tablespoonfuls over the
apples. Bake for 45 mins, or until bubbling.
