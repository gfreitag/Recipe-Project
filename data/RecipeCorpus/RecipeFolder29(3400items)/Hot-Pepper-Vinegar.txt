Title: Hot Pepper Vinegar
Categories: Hot/spicy, Condiments, Chilies
Yield: 1 quart
2 tb Cilantro; dried
1 qt Vinegar, distilled white
20    Hot peppers; fresh, mixed
5 cl Garlic
1 tb Black peppercorns; whole
The above ingredients are approximations.  Vary them to control the
flavor and heat content to your preference.

Select a variety of hot peppers based on flavor and color.  Stem
them, and slit them open along the length of the pepper.  Peel the
garlic cloves and split them at least in half; in thirds if they are
large. Put the peppers, garlic, peppercorns, and cilantro in a
sterilized bottle with a tight fitting lid.  Add the vinegar until
the bottle is filled to the top and seal.

Let the mixture sit for one week in a cool, dark place.  Make sure to
shake it gently at least once a day.  Taste constantly, and enjoy the
slowly building heat and flavor.  At the end of the week, you can
strain the mixture if you desire.  Or, for a hotter brew, leave in
the ingredients for another 1-3 weeks before straining.

Better still is to leave in the ingredients, and to top off the
vinegar with fresh as it is being used.  When the heat and flavor
starts to waver, strain the ingredients and replace with fresh ones.
