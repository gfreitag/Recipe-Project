Categories: Condiments, Herbs/spice, Indian
Yield: 1 batch
1 ts Lime juice
1/2 ts Sugar
Salt; to taste
1 ts Vegetable oil
1/2 ts Mustard seeds
1/2 ts Cumin seeds
2 md Bunches fresh coriander*
1 md Bunch fresh mint
6    Fresh jalapenos; or to taste
1 sm Onion; chopped
1/2    Inch piece fresh ginger
-- peeled and grated
*Usually called cilantro when fresh.

Coarsely chop coriander, mint, and peppers.  Process the first eight
ingredients in a blender, adding enough water to make a coarse paste.
Transfer to a nonmetallic container.

Heat oil in a saucepan.  Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.  Add
cumin seeds and stir until fragrant.  Remove from heat and add to
chutney. Mix well before serving.  The chutney is best when made just
before serving, but leftovers may be refrigerated and used within 24
hours.

"Herb Companion" writes: "This tongue-tingling chutney from India
goes well with party snacks, breads, and rice dishes.  The spiciness
can be adjusted to individual palates."
