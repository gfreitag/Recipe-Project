Title: Baby Turnip Gratin+
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 c  Gruyere cheese, grated
1 1/2 c  Evaporated skim milk
1 1/2 lb Small to medium turnips
Salt and pepper to taste
1 1/2 ts Fresh thyme, 3/4 ts. dried
Peel the turnips, and slice them into thin rounds. Bring 3 to 4
quarts of water to a boil, add a tablespoon of salt, and cook the
turnips for a minute to remove any bitterness. Pour them into a
colander to drain.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter shallow gratin dish. Cover
the bottom of one large or 2 small gratin dishes with an overlapping
layer of turnips and season with salt, freshly ground pepper and some
of the thyme. Make a second layer of turnip slices and the
seasonings, enwing with the cheese. Pour the milk over all and bake.
Check after 15 minutes and baste some of the milk over the top if it
has begun to boil. Remove the gratin when most of the milk has been
absorbed and there is a golden crust over the top, about 30 minutes
in all. Set it aside to cool for a few minutes.

If you can, slide a spatula under the gratin and slide it onto a
plate.

Note: When I find this gratin delectable is in the early spring when
the turnips are very small. Be sure to use the tops for greens!
