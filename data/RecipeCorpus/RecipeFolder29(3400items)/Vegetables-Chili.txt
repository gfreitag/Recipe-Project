Notes/Hints: For fat free, spray vegetables with Pam and omit oil,
thus "wilting" them instead of cooking in oil. Wilt means using
little heat and covering the pan. Also, because of use of canned
vegetables, this recipe may not be suitable for those on a low-sodium
diet. Suggested toppings for chili:  non-fat sour cream, non-fat
cheddar cheese substitute, and chopped scallions.
