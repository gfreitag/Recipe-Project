Title: Catherine Russell's Maple Mousse
Categories: Countyfairs, Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Maple Syrup
4    Egg Whites
2 c  Heavy Cream
3 c  Milk
4    Egg Yolks
2 c  Sugar
2 tb Flour
1. In a large saucepan, scald the milk by heating it just until little
bubbles form at the edge of pan. DO NOT LET IT BOIL. Remove from heat.

2. Beat the egg yolks well. Mix 1 cup of sugar with the flour. Add the
maple syrup, sugar-flour mixture, and the beaten yolks to the
saucepan of milk. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the
mixture thickens enough to coat a wooden spoon, approx. 10 mins.
Remove immediately from heat and let cool. Cooling will take 30 mins
or longer.

3. In a bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. In another
bowl, whip the cream, slowly adding the remaining cup of sugar, until
soft peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the whipped cream.

4. When the custard has cooled, fold the egg white-cream mixture into
it. Spoon the mixture into 2 refrigerator ice cube trays and place
in freezer. Stir the mixture twice as it freezes, to break the
crystals.

Freeze until firm. This fancy dessert can be topped with fresh
raspberries.
