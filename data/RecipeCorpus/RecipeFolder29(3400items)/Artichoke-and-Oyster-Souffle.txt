Categories: Seafood, Vegetables, Masterchefs, New orleans
Yield: 4 servings
Oyster Souffle Base **
Oyster Sauce **
4 md Artichokes
1 md Lemon, halved
** See recipes for Oyster Souffle Base, and Oyster Sauce.

Trim the artichokes and rub the cut ends with lemon.  (This
prevents oxidation which can turn the ends of the artichokes brown.)

Drop the artichokes into boiling salted water and cook for 30
minutes or until the bottoms are just tender and a leaf pulls out
with only slight resistance.

Remove the choke from the water, re-form the cooked artichoke and
stuff with the souffle base.

Preheat your oven to 375 F.

Bake for 20 minutes or until the souffle is puffed and brown.

Serve topped with Oyster Sauce.
