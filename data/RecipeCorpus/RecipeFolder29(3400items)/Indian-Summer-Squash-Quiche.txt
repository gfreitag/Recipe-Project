Title: Indian Summer Squash Quiche
Categories: Vegetables, Pie/tart
Yield: 6 servings
2    Eggs
3/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Buttermilk -- powdered
1/4 ts Oregano leaves
1/2 ts Salt
1    Pie crust -- unbaked
1    Onions -- chopped
1 tb Butter
1 c  Summer squash -- sliced
1/2 c  Cheese -- shredded
2    Egg yolks
Swiss cheese is recommended.

Saute onion in butter until tender.  Simmer or steam squash in a small
amount of water until just tender.  Drain on paper towels, removing
as much moisture as possible.

Preheat oven to 375.  Put onions in pastry shell, arrange squash on
top. Cover with cheese.  In separate bowl, beat egg yolks, whole
eggs, water, buttermilk powder, oregano and salt.  Pour into crust.
Bake 35 minutes, until custard is set.  If crust becomes too brown,
cover top with foil strips.

Cut into thin wedges to make 12-16 appetizer pieces, or cut into 6-8
wedges for side dish or entree servings.

Notes:  Other herbs may be substituted.  If using fresh herbs,
increase quantity to 3/4 teaspoon.  Other vegetables may be
substituted also; lightly cooked carrots, asparagus, cauliflower, or
broccoli would work well.
