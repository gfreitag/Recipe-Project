Title: Settler's Cranberry Sauce
Categories: Can/preserv, Salsa/sauce, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
No Ingredients Found
A quart of the ripe picked berries, stewed with as much water as will
keep them from drying to the pan, closely covered; a pound of soft
sugar must be added when the fruit is burst; boil half an hour after
you add the sugar, and stir them well.  When quite stewed enough,
pour them into a basin or mould;  When cold they will be jellied so
as to turn out whole in the form of the mould.  This jam is usually
served with roasted venison, mutton and beef.  It make rich
ope-tarts, or can be served at tea table in glass plates, to eat with
bread.  The Indians attribute great medicinal virtues to the
cranberrry, either cooked or raw.  In the uncooke state, the berry is
harsh and very astringent.  They use it in dysentery, and also in
applications as a oultice to wounds and inflammatory tumours, with
great effect. Origin: The Canadian Settler's Guide, written in 1855.
