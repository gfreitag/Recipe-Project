From the author: "In my recipe, smoked shoulder or butt of pork is
combined with winter vegetables and chicken.  The smoked pork is
already cooked, which greatly reduces boiling time.  The chicken legs
and thighs go in last because they cook quickly.  Serve guests a
little of each ingredient along with Dijon-style mustard, grated
horseradish and cornichons. A mixed green salad is all you need on
the side."
