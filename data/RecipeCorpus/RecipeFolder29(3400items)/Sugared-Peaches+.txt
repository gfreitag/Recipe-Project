MMMMM------------------FRESH PEACHES IN SEASON-----------------------
Light cream, sour cream, or
-creme fraiche
Sugar to taste-using
-powdered sugar, maple sugar
-brown sugar, or maple syrup
The earliest peaches in season are usually the white ones. To ripen
peaches keep them out of the refrigerator in a plastic bag in a dark
place for a day or two or put them in a bag with a ripe apple and
make a hole in the bag, and store it in a dark place. When peaches
are fully ripe you can peel them the way the Greek and the Portuguese
waiters do; rub each peach with the dull side of a butter knife
without breaking the skin. This loosens the skin so that, with
practice, it can be removed in one piece with a squeeze of the hand,
a spectacular trick.

The same problem with ripeness applies to the peaches having yellow
and orange pulp, which are available later in the season. Sometimes
you can try anything and if the peaches are hard when you buy them,
they will never ripen properly. Buying them ripe is the better thing.

Depending on size, allow 1 to 3 peaches per person. Slice the peaches
at the last possible moment to prevent them from discoloring. Add
sugar to taste, the ammount will vary greatly, depending on the
acidity of the peach. Some peaches will require a mere sprinkling
while others require none at all. Several sugars can be
used-confectioners sugar, granulated sugar, brown sugar, Demerara
sugar or maple sugar. Maple sugar is also good. Light cream, sour
cream, and cre`me fraiche are natural companions to peaches.
