Title: Cream Wafers
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 5 dozen
MMMMM---------------------------WAFERS--------------------------------
1/3 c  Heavy whipping cream
Granulated sugar
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Butter or marg., softened
MMMMM-----------------------CREAMY FILLING----------------------------
1 ts Vanilla
Few drops food coloring
1/4 c  Butter or marg., softened
3/4 c  Powdered sugar
Mix flour, softened butter and whipping cream. Cover and refrigerate
at least one hour. Heat oven to 375. Roll about 1/3 of the dough at a
time 1/8" thick on floured cloth-covered board [keeping remaining
dough refrigerated until ready to roll]. Cut into 1 1/2" circles.
Transfer circles with a spatula to waxed paper coated with sugar.
Turn each circle so both sides are coated with sugar. Place on an
un-greased cookie sheet. Prick each circle with a fork 4 times. Bake
7-9 min or until just set but not brown. Cool. Just before serving
make sandwiches with 1/2 tsp of the creamy filling.

For the filling, beat butter, sugar and vanilla until smooth and
fluffy. Tint with food color if desired. Stir in a few drops of water
if the mixture is too stiff to spread.
