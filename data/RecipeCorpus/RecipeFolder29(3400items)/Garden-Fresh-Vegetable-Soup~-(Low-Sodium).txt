Categories: Low cal/fat, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/2 c  Broccoli florets
1/2 c  Small mushrooms --
Quartered
1 sm Yellow squash (about 1/4 lb)
Sliced 1/2" thick
1/2 c  Plain low-fat yogurt
1 tb Unsalted margarine
4 sm White onions -- peeled
3 tb Flour
2 1/2 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
1 md Carrot, peeled, and sliced
Diagonally -- 1/2" thick
1 1/2 ts Dried tarragon -- crumbled
1 ts Lemon juice
In a large heavy saucepan, melt the margarine over moderate heat. Add
the whole onions and cook, turning frequently, for 8 to 10 minutes or
until browned on all sides; transfer to a plate lined with paper
towels and set aside.

Blend the flour into the saucepan drippings and cook over moderate
heat, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually whisk in the chicken
broth and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened--about
3 minutes.

Add the reserved onions and the carrot, tarragon, lemon juice, and
pepper. Bring to a boil, adjust the heat so that the mixture bubbles
gently, cover, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Add the broccoli,
mushrooms, and squash, cover, and cook about 5 minutes longer or
until all the vegetables are tender.

Gradually whisk in the yogurt and heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Do not
boil or the mixture will curdle.
