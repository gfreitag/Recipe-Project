Title: Lillie's Squash Dinner In A Skillet
Categories: Countyfairs, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings  Use any tender summer squash; yellow, banana, zucchini, crookneck, or
pattypan. You can even try a combination of the above. The amount of
squash required will be based upon the number of people eating.
Start, by cutting up an onion and saute it in oil and butter. Add the
squash of your choice, sliced or cubed. Put in a light sprinkling of
caraway seed as a flavor enhancer. Add one potato per person, cut up
like the squash.

Now add smoked sausage or ham, cut up; then a clove or two of garlic,
if you desire. Then sprinkle with seasoned salt, very lightly because
the sausage or ham will add flavor. Cover with a tight lid. The
squash will make the necessary liquid, but if it's too dry, add a
little chicken broth. Cover again and smother until the potatoes are
done. Great with rye bread. A whole meal in one pot.
