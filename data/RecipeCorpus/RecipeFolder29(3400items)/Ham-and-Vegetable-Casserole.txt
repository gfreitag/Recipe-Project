Cook potatoes in boiling salted water until tender, about 15-20

and season to taste with a little salt and pepper.  Spread potato
mixture on bottom and up sides of a 2-quart casserole to form a
shell. Cook frozen mixed vegetables according to package directions.
Drain and set aside.

In a saucepan, melt the 3 tablespoons butter, blend in flour, salt,
and pepper.  Add milk.  Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Add
Swiss and Parmesan cheeses.  Stir until melted. Stir in cubed ham and
cooked vegetables.

Spoon mixture into potato-lined casserole, making sure mixture is
below the edge of the potato shell.  Brush exposed surface of
potatoes with melted butter.

Bake, uncovered in a 375 degrees oven until mixture is heated through
and potatoes are lightly browned, about 30-35 minutes.

Makes 6-8 servings.
