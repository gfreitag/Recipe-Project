This is a quick introduction to some ancient native Roman recipe
ingredients...such as:

Caroenum:  Boiled must (you have to boil the new wine or grape juice
until
it is only half the amount you started with).
:

Defritum:  Either thick fig syrup, or must that's boiled until you
have
only a third of the amount with which you started.
:

Liebstoeckl:  In Latin it's called "levisticum officinale". It's an
umbelliferous plant with yellowish flowers. Its dried
roots
are used as spice.  It seems to be a kind of celery.

Liquamen:  A salty fish sauce.  Most of the time you can replace it
with
salt.
:

Passum:  Very sweet wine sauce, made by boiling the must (new wine or
grape juice) to thicken it.  (Maybe add honey?....just a
:
guess)

Poleiminze: A kind of mint that's growing in inundated areas. Just
replace
it with ordinary mint.
:

Saturei:  In Latin it's called "satureia hortensis".  It's a violet or
white flowered kind of labiate plant which grows mainly in
Southern Europe.  It's used as a spice plant, especially for
bean dishes.

:

Silphium:  Its other names are "Laser" or "ferula asa foetida".  It's
also
called a "hing" in the Indian cuisine.  It is an onion and
garlic subsitute and should be used rather sparingly
:
:
because of
its very strong taste and smell.

Also, here are some useful conversions:

5 ml = 1 tsp
15 ml = 1 tbsp
28.3 g  = 1 ounce (100 g = 3.5 ounces)
454 g  = 1 pound (1 kg = 2.2 pounds)
250 ml = 1 cup
1 L  = 4 cups
180 deg C  = 350 deg F
220 deg C  = 425 deg F
