Heat oven to 400 degrees.  Make filling:  In large bowl, combine
strawberries, rhubarb, sugar, flour, vanilla and allspice until
well-blended.  Set aside.  Make pastry dough:  In a medium size bowl,
combine flour, salt, baking powder and sugar.  Using a pastry blender
or two knives, cut butter into flour mixture until the mixture
resembles coarse crumbs.  Slowly add the cream, stirring with a fork,
until the dough holds together in a ball.  Lightly flour a work
surface and a rolling pin. Roll the dough evenly, from the center
outward, into an 8-by-12 inch rectangle 1/4 inch thick.  Spoon fruit
mixture into a 9 by 13 inch baking pan.  Sprinkle the orange rind
over the fruit. Place the pastry dough over the fruit.  Using sharp
knife, cut steam vents in the dough. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or
until the pastry is lightly browned and the fruit is tender. Remove
the pan from the oven and set on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes.
Serve warm.
