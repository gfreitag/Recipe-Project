Categories: Cake/cookie, Countyfairs
Yield: 1 servings
2 1/2 c  Sugar
6    Egg Yolks, lightly beaten
1 c  Buttermilk
1 1/2 ts Baking Soda
2/3 c  Seedless Raisins
1 c  Pecans, chopped
6    Egg Whites
Caramel Icing
(separate recipe)
3 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Ground Allspice
1 ts Nutmeg, freshly grated
1 ts Ground Cloves
1 c  Blackberry Jam
1 c  Strawberry Jam
1 c  Peach Preserves
1/2 lb Unsalted Butter, softened
* Heat oven to 350 F.

1. Prepare four 8-inch cake pans, cut 4 rounds of parchment paper to
fit bottoms of pans. Butter the pans liberally and position the
parchment liners.

2. Sift together the flour, salt, allspice, nutmeg and cloves. Set
aside. Push the blackberry and strawberry jams and peach preserves
through a sieve into a bowl. Set aside.

3. In large bowl of heavy-duty mixer, cream the butter and sugar
together until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks and combine well.

4. Put in the buttermilk in a 2-cup and stir in the baking soda.

5. With mixer on low speed, add the flour and buttermilk mixtures
alternately, beginning and ending with flour. Beat until batter is
smooth. Stir in jams, raisins and nuts.

6. Beat the egg white until they form stiff, unwavering peaks. Scoop
the whites over the batter and gently fold then in with a rubber
spatula. Pour the batter into the baking pans, dividing it evenly and
smoothing the tops with spatula.

7. Bake in center of oven 30 to 35 mins, or until a toothpick
inserted in center comes out clean. Let cool 10 mins on wire racks,
then turn out on racks to cool completely. When completely cooled,
frost with caramel frosting.
