Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
-1/4"
Slices, and separated into
-rings,
Or 6 large zucchini, cut
-into 1/2"
Slices
Vegetable oil
2 c  Self-rising flour
2/3 c  Yellow cornmeal
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
1 3/4 c  Milk
1    Egg, beaten
6 lg Onions, peeled, cut into
"Use yellow cornmeal if you can find it.  East of the Mississippi, the
favored color is white.  The closer you get to Texas, the easier it
is to find yellow in supermarkets."

Combine first 4 ingredients in a large bowl; beat in milk and egg.
Let stand 5 minutes.  Add onion or zucchini slices to batter in
batches and toss with hands until vegetables are well coated. When
you are ready to fry them, pick up vegetables, allowing excess batter
to slide back into bowl. Places slices immediately in hot oil (375
degrees), and deep-fry until browned, turning once.  Drain in a
colander, and sprinkle with additional salt, if desired.

Note:  Don't drain on paper towels; the fried food will get soggy.
Also, try not to stack them tightly.  Air needs to circulate around
fried food so it will remain crisp.
