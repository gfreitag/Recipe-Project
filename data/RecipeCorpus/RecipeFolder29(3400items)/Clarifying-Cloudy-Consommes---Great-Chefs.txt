Clarifying Cloudy Consomme: ===========================

Mix vegetables with egg whites.

When consomme is cold, add the vegetables and egg whites mixture
and bring to a boil, then lower the heat.  A crust will form on the
top. Let the consomme simmer until clear.

Strain by moving crust to the side and pouring through
cheese-cloth without breaking the crust.
