"I made these banana squares often.  They freeze well and make a great
snack to have on hand when friends drop by for coffee." - Susan Miller
Whipped cream and sliced bananas, opt.

In a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form; set
aside. In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Beat in
egg yolks; mix well.

Add bananas. Combine flour and baking soda; add to creamed mixture
alternately with milk, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla.
Fold in egg whites.

Fold in nuts if desired. Pour into a greased 13x9x2" baking pan.
Bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes.

Cool on a wire rack. If desired, garnish with a dollop of whipped
cream and a few banana slices.

* = To sour milk, place 1 tsp. white vinegar in a measuring cup. Add
enough milk to equal 1/4 cup
