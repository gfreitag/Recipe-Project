each blintz, pour enough batter to thinly coat pan bottom and tilt
immediately so that batter spreads over the entire bottom surface of
the pan. Lightly brown one side of the blintz and slide it out onto a
towel, cooked side up. 3. Prepare the filling by mixing all the
ingredients until smooth. 4. With cooked side up, place 1 heaping
tablespoon of the filling in the center of each blintz and gently
fold the sides over to form an envelope., being careful not to crack
the blintz. 5. Heat the remaining butter or margarine in a large

sour cream, honey or confectioner's sugar. NOTE: Because of the
coarseness of the matzo meal, these blintzes will be thick. Makes 8
