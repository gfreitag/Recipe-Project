Title: Still Cove New England Fish Chowder
Categories: Seafood, Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1/2    Bay Leaf
1/8 ts Thyme
4    Potatoes, peeled and diced
1 1/2 qt Milk/ Light Cream
1/4 lb Salt Pork
1/2 c  Bacon, diced
2 lb Haddock Or Cod
Salt And Pepper, to taste
Fry the salt pork in a heavy kettle unti crisp (use low heat).
Remove salt pork and add onion to the fat and cook until tender, then
add potatoes and enough water to cover them.  Cook, covered, over
moderate heat until potatoes are just tender but not soggy.  Rinse
the fish and cut crosswise in fairly large pieces.  In another kettle
or saucepan simmer the fish in just enough water to cover for about
15 minutes, or until it flakes easily. Strain the stock into the
potato and onion mixutre.  Take all bones and skin from the fish and
add to the first kettle.  Now melt the butter in a Dutch oven or
kettle and blend in the flour and seasonings. Slowly add milk and
cream, stirring until thickened and smooth. Add the fish mixture and
simmer for about 15 minutes, covered.

Cool and store in the refrigerator overnight.

Before serving heat  gently, stirring constantly.  Do not boil, as
boiling will toughen the fish.  If the chowder is too thick, add some
more chream while it is heating.  Sprinkle with paprika and serve in
deep bowls with crackers.

Makes 4 quarts.
