Heat the extra oil in a large, shallow pan. Add the potatoes in a
single layer. Cook, turning once, until the potatoes are golden brown.

Roll out the pastry between two sheets of greaseproof paper to fit a
23cm fluted flan tin. Line the tin with the pastry and bake for 25-30
minutes or until crisp and golden brown.

Spread the onion filling over the base of the cooked pastry. Arrange
the potatoes on top of the onion. Spread over the sour cream and
sprinkle with paprika. Bake in a hot over (200C) for 8 minutes or
until the top is golden brown. Serve hot or at room temperature.
