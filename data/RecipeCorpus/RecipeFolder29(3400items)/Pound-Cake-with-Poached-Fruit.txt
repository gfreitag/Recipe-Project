(My note:  I doubt that there can be zero CHOLESTEROL because of the
pound cake using eggs--but that's what the newspaper said so that's
what I typed.) I got this from Candy Sagon's (THE WASHINGTON POST)
column appearing in THE OLYMPIAN, 4/5/95--this may or may not be a
recipe attributable to Katherine Alford (NYC cooking teacher and
chef). The picture accompanying the column said "Special to the
Olympian."
