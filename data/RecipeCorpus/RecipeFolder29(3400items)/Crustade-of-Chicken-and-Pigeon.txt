Categories: Poultry, Pastry, Game, Medieval
Yield: 6 servings
2/3 c  Dry white wine
x  Several grinds black pepper
4    Cloves
1/2 oz Butter
2 oz Mushrooms, roughly chopped
1 oz Raisins
3 lg Eggs
x  Salt and pepper, to taste
1/2 ts Ginger, ground
8 oz (to 12 oz.) wholemeal or
-wholewheat pastry
(depending on whether you
-want a lid on your
-crustade)
1    Pigeon
2    Chicken joints (two breasts
2/3 two whole legs)
2 c  Water or chicken stock
Roll out 8 ounces of the pastry and line an 8-inch flan dish; back the
crust blind.  Put the pigeon in a pot with the stock, wine, pepper and
cloves and cook very slowly for an hour.  Add the chicken and
continue to cook for a further 45 minutes or till the meat of both
birds is really tender.  Meanwhile, cook the mushrooms lightly in the
butter.  Remove the birds from the stock and bone them.  Cut the
flesh into qhite small pieces, mix it with the mushrooms and the
raisins and spread them over the base of the flan case.  Beat the
eggs with a fork and season with the salt, pepper, and ginger.  Add 1
cup of the cooking juices and pour over the meat in the flan case.
If you want to have a lid.  roll out the rest of the pastry and cover
the flan.  Bake in moderate oven (350 degrees F) for 25 minutes if
uncovered, 35 minutes if covered.  Serve warm with a good green salad.

For a more 20th century flavor -- double the chicken, leave out the
pigeon, and substitute 1 oz. chopped fried bacon for the raisins.
