Title: Ella Walker's White Fruitcake
Categories: Breads, Cake/cookie
Yield: 12 servings
Cherries
(13 1/2 Oz Ea)
2    Containers Candied Pineapple
(13 1/2 Oz Ea)
1 lb White Raisins
1/2 lb Currants
1/2 lb Walnut Halves, shelled
1 c  Unsweetened Pineapple Juice
1/2 c  Light Corn Syrup
Additional Nuts And Cherries
For decorating
1 lb Butter, at room temperature
2 c  Granulated Sugar
10    Eggs
4 c  Flour, unsifted
1 ts Mixed Pastry Spices *
1/2 ts Mace
2 ts Baking Powder
1 ts Salt
2    Containers Glace Red
Cherries
(13 1/2 Oz Ea)
2    Containers Glace Green
* Substitute a mixture of ground cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and
cloves.

* Preheat oven to 250 F. Line an 18 x 12 x 2-inch pan with 4 layers of
brown paper. Grease the top layer and over it with a sheet of waxed
paper. (The brown paper prevents burning over the long baking
period.) You can also use 2 smaller pans.

1. Use an electric mixer and beat the butter and sugar together on
low, then moderate, speed until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one
at a time, and beat after each addition. Batter should be well mixed.

2. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, spices, baking powder and
salt. Work in the cherries, pineapple, raisins, currants and walnuts.

3. Add the flour mix to the butter mixture, and blend. Place in the
prepared pan and bake for 2 hrs. Cool on a cake rack.

4. When cake has cooled enough to handle, cut it into 3- x 6-inch
sections. Make the glaze by combining the pineapple juice and corn
syrup and bring to a rolling boil. Brush sections with the glaze and
decorate with nuts and cherries. When the glaze has cooled, and not
before, wrap the sections in wax paper and then in foil. Store in
tins. This cake will keep for a long time.
