Title: Diabetic Chocolate Smunchies
Categories: Diabetic, Desserts
Yield: 35 servings
70    Graham cracker squares
Low-cal whipped topping
1 pk Sugar-free chocolate pudding
2 c  Nonfat milk
3 c  Peanut butter
MY NOTE:  The first time you might want to use just part of the
pudding for smunchies.  Some whipped topping recipes and mixes freeze
OK for a few days but haven't tested any longer than a week.

Mix chocolate pudding according to directions on package using nonfat
milk. Cool thoroughly.  Mix peanut butter with pudding. Drop 1 Tbsp.
onto 1 square graham gracker. Place (1 Tbsp ?) low-calorie whipped
topping on top of pudding mixture, cover with second graham cracker
square. Freeze until ready to use.
