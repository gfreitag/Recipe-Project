"People in Mississippi say, It ain't Mississippi mud if it doesn't
leave your mouth coated with sugar."

Prehat oven to 350 degrees.  Sift flour, baking powder, and salt
together 3 times.  Set aside.  Combine sugar and cocoa; mix well.
Beat egg yolks in large bowl of electric mixer. Beat in water,
vanila, and sugar mixture at medium speed. Beat in flour mixture.
Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; stir one-fourth of chocolate
batter gently into whites. Fold egg whites into remaining batter.
Pour into a greased and floured 13x9x2" baking pan and bake for 25 to
30 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out
clean. Remove from oven and sprinkle marshmallows evenly over cake.
Bake 5 minutes longer, or until marshmallows begin to melt.  Cool in
pan on a wire rack. Spread with Mud Icing. From: "Original Whistle
