Title: Red Lobster Cheese Rolls
Categories: Breads, Pastry, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Cold water; scant cup
3 oz Sharp Cheddar cheese;
Grated
1 oz Butter; OR margarine
1 x  Garlic salt; or powder
1 x  Parsley flakes
1 x  Italian seasonings
2 c  Bisquick
These do freeze, however, so it's worthwhile making the larger batch
and freezing the ones you do not plan to use immediately. Preheat
oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by large
spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes. After
baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed with
garlic powder, parsley flakes and italian seasoning. (Amounts will
vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.) Serve
hot.

Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick, 1/2 cup cold
water, and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will yield about 12 biscuits.
