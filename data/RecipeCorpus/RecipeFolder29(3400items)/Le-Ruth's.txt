Great cooking is both an art and a science, and nobody
exemplifies a greater mastery of both aspects than Chef Warren Le
Ruth. After working in the laboratories of corporate food service
companies developing products and flavors, he decided it was time to
return to his roots in New Orleans and open a showplace for a special
brand of Creole cuisine.

Ensconcing Le Ruth's in a comfortable remodeled house, Chef Le
Ruth set about developing a new haute Creole style based on New
Orleans provender prepared with classic European techniques,.  The
combination is unique and wonderful --- a perfect blending of
time-proven dishes with a special flair, always balanced and always
consistent.

Chef Warren Le Ruth is still experimenting with flavors, for
himself, for fellow chefs, and for corporate clients.  His
measurements are precise, worked out over years of trial (but not of
error), and each ingredient is meticulously weighed or meted out with
careful thought ot its effect on the final product.

Because Chef Le Ruth has done all the preliminary work, the
recreation of his dishes is relatively simple, sometimes deceptively
so. While loose interpretation of recipes is often encouraged in this
book, with Le Ruth's formulas strict adherence is suggested.  Each
stop and each ingredient is there for a purpose.  The beautiful food
created by Le Ruth the Artist has been carefully thought out by Le
Ruth the Scientist.
