Categories: Fruit, Information
Yield: 1 servings  Wash, hull and slice into large shallow pan.  Sweeten - 1 cup sugar
to 4 cups prepared berries - or to taste.  Stir and let stand in pan
until sugar dissolves (just a few minutes) then put in freezer
containers leaving 1/2 inch head space for expansion.  Put into
