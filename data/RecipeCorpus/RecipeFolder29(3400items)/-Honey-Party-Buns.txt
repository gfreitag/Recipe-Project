1
water 2
water (110-115 degrees) 2 eggs, beaten 1 tsp. baking powder 1 tsp.
salt 3 1/2 cups whole wheat flour 4-4 1/2 cups flour Sliced ham,
cheese and lettuce

Place butter and honey in a large mixing bowl; pour boiling water
over and set aside to cool to 110-115 degrees.  In a small bowl,
dissolve yeast in warm water; set aside.  To honey mixture, add eggs,
baking powder and salt. Add yeast mixture and whole wheat flour; beat
until smooth.  Stir in enough flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto
a floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes.
Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let
rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down;
divide in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half to 1/2"
thickness; cut with a 2 1/2" cutter. Place on greased baking sheets.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake
at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from
pans to cool on wire racks. Make into small sandwiches, if desired,
by filling with ham, cheese and lettuce or just serve plain.
