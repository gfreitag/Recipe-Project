1. In a stainless steel or enamel saucepan combine all the ingredients
through the oil.

2. Set aside to mellow for 1 hour, or more if possible.

3. Strain the sauce and discard the ginger (if using fresh), garlic,
bay leaf, and lemon slices. Add the butter, salt, and Tabasco sauce,
and simmer for 3 mins.

Makes 4 cups. A more delicate baste than traditional Southern barbecue
sauces. It has a bit of a tang and is not very sweet, It does not
overpower the taste of the meat or fish it is used on. Especially
fine on chicken. Use as thin a coating as possible for best results.
