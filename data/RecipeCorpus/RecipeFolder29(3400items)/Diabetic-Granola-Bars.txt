Categories: Diabetic, Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 24 servings
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1/2 c  Rolled oats
1/2 c  Raisins; chopped
1/2 c  Dried apricots; chopped
1/2 c  Sunflower seeds
1/2 c  Wheat germ
2 tb Sesame seeds
1/3 c  Vegetable oil
1/3 c  Brown sugar, packed
1/4 c  Molasses
6 oz Frozen orange juice concentr
2 c  Flour, whole wheat or all-p
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Ground cinnamon
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Cream the oil, brown sugar, and molasses
together in a bowl.  Add the defrosted unsweetened orange juice
concentrate.

Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and ginger. Blend into the
creamed mixture.

Stir in the oats, raisins, apricots, sunflower seeds, wheat germ, and
sesame seeds.  This makes a very stiff batter.

Spread in a greased 9 x 13 pan.  Bake about 20-30 minutes or until
light brown.  Cut into bars.  These are more like a dense cake than
commercial granola bars.
