Title: Finnish Barley Bread
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
1 c  Water
2 c  Pearl barley
2 c  Buttermilk
2 c  Barley flour
You will need a medium size bread bowl, an 8-inch cast-iron
skillet, and a blender.  Combine the pearl barley and the buttermilk
in the bowl cover and let soak overnight. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees.  Add water to the buttermilk mixture, then transfer to the
blender and blend until the barley becomes pulverized. (It won't
become a smooth puree.) Return the batter to the bread bowl, add the
barley flour, soda and salt and mix well. Turn the batter out into
the skillet. Bake in the center of the oven for 50 minutes. Let cool
on rack before serving.  Serving suggestions include having it with
soup or with jam or honey.
