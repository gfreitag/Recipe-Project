White Wine Sauce: =================

In a saute pan heat the butter, then add the shallots, and
mushrooms. Cook briefly for about two minutes.

Add the wine and 1 cup of fish fume, cook about 5 minutes more.

Add cream to thicken (sauce should be more white than gray).
Reduce for 20 minutes, then strain through chinois.

Reduce again for 3 - 4 minutes more.  Sauce should be thick
enough to coat a spoon.

Whip, add salt and pepper and reserve.

Fish: =====

Slice the salmon from the boned fish at an angle, about 1 to 1
1/2 inches thick.  Pound the filets thin under a dampened plastic
paper and store in parchment paper until ready to cook.

Salt the salmon lightly inside and out.

In a non-stick pan, heat 2 tablespoons of butter.  When the
butter is hot, take the pan off the heat, place the salmon in the
pan, return the pan to heat, and cook briefly (three to four minutes.)

Remove from heat, turn once, and place back on the heat.  Cook
for three or four minutes more.

Take the pan off of the heat and turn the salmon one last time
for the "cool side" to absorb some of the juices.

To serve, spoon sauce into a pool on a serving plate, place
salad in center of the plate, and arrange salmon on the salad.

Garnish with red basil leaves.
