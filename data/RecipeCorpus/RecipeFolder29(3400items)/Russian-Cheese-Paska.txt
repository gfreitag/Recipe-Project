**Molded in the shape of a pyramid, cheese paska is the traditional
companion of the Ukrainian Easter bread, also called paska (recipe
given separately). This delicate spread may be served as a cheesecake
dessert, or spread in a thick layer on slices of kulich.**

Cream butter and sugar until well blended.  Split vanilla bean;
scrape out seeds and add to butter.  Add lemon peel, salt, egg yolks,
mixing well. Beat in cottage cheese, cream, fruit (optional), and
nuts.

Line a Russian paska mold or a 2 to 2-1/2 qt. clean clay or plastic
flower pot (with drain at base) with 2 or 3 layers rinsed, wrung
cheesecloth. Spoon cheese into mold; fold cloth over top of cheese.
Cover with lid or plate.  Place weights (canned foods or brick) on
the lid.  Elevate mold for drainage in shallow pan.  Refrigerate
until firm, at least 24 hours. Unmold onto serving plate.

You may write the Cyrllic letters X B (Christ is risen) on sides of
pyramid with icing or diced glazed fruits.  Decorate top with tiny
fresh or icing flowers.  Surround base with lemon leaves and colored
eggs. Serve with slices of kulich or Ukranian Easter Bread.  Serves
