Title: Clam And Corn Souffle
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Melted butter
2 tb Minced onion
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Worcestershire
1/2 c  Sharp cheese, shredded
1 1/4 c  Soda crackers, crumbled
1 c  Milk
2    Eggs, beaten
1 cn Minced clams, undrained
1 c  Frozen corn
A real taste teaser.  No one will guess what is in it.

Corn should be thawed, but not cooked.

Soak crackers until soggy in milk and eggs -- about half an hour.
Then add all but the cheese.  Mix gently and refrigerate in a 1 1/2
quart casserole.

When ready to bake, place casserole, uncovered, in 300 F oven for 50
minutes. Sprinkle cheese on top and allow it to bake just long enough
to melt cheese, about 10 minutes more.

Good with Molded salad.
