1/4 c  Dry Bread Crumbs
1 tb Onion, grated
1    Egg, beaten
1/2 ts Salt
1 pk (10 Oz) Spinach,
-frozen, chopped
3/4 c  Swiss Cheese, shredded
2 tb Parmesan Cheese, grated
1. Place spinach pkg in microwave and cook on High 4 to 5 mins or
until defrosted. (Adjust for your oven). Drain, pressing down hard to
extract as much liquid as possible.

2. Mix the spinach well with the Swiss and Parmesan cheeses, bread
crumbs, onion, egg and salt. Shape into 1-inch balls, using 1 1/2 tsp
of mixture for each ball. Place on wax paper-lined baking sheet and
cover with plastic wrap. Freeze overnight. (To keep longer, pack in
dozen lots in suitable freezer containers and label. Keep no longer
than 2 weeks.)

3. To serve, place balls on microwavable paper-towel-lined baking
sheet. Microwave on High for 2 mins. (Adjust for your oven.) Reduce
power to Medium or half power. Microwave 4 1/2 to 6 mins, or until
hot and just set, rearranging once or twice.
