Title: Almond Meringue - Master Chefs
Categories: Basics, Masterchefs, New york
Yield: 4 cups
-- plus more as needed
3/4 c  Almonds, ground, blanched
-- (about 2 ounces)
6    Egg whites, at room temp.
2 1/2 tb Sugar
2 1/2 c  Sugar, powdered, sifted,
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Cut out three 10-inch parchment paper
circles and one 10-inch cardboard circle.  Set the parchment circles
on baking sheets.

Beat egg whites to soft peaks and gradually add 2 1/2
tablespoons of sugar and continue beating until stiff.  Combine 2 1/2
cups of powdered sugar and ground almonds; fold into egg whites.

This mixture can now be used to form layers, or designs or
whatever your choose.  Simply spoon mixture into a pastry bag fitted
with the tip of your choice, and pipe your designs onto parchment
paper covered baking sheets.

Dust lightly with powdered sugar (optional.) Then bake the your
meringue until crisp and very lightly golden (for designs about a
half inch thick, it takes 25 to 30 minutes.)

Cool on the finished baked meringue on racks.
