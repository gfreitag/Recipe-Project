Categories: Pizza, Potato
Yield: 1 pizza
-sliced 1/4" thick
1/2 c  Tomatoes; chopped
1/2 c  Arugula; chopped
1/4 c  Red onions;
1 tb Blue cheese;
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper;
1 pk (8-oz) Italian bread shell;
-(such as Boboli)
2 ts Olive oil;
1/4 c  Tomato sauce;
2 cl Garlic; minced
1/2 ts Red pepper; crushed
8 oz Sm. red potatoes; cooked
* ABOUT ARUGULA: A somewhat bitter-tasting and assertive green,
arugula can be found in most large supremarkets.  Look for small,
bright green leaves. Plan to use arugula within a few days: it
preishes faily quickly.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.  Place the bread shell on a large baking
sheet. Brush with the oil and top with tomato sauce.  Sprinkle with
garlic and pepper flakes.  Top with the potatoes, tomatoes, arugula,
onions, blue cheese and black pepper.   Bake until the bread is
golden brown and the cheese has melted, 15 to 20 minutes.  Serves 2.
