* Toast just until the odor of the oregano is noticeable, do not
burn. Oregano will begin to smoke lightly when ready.

** Mince the garlic, and saute it quickly in a very hot pan with
as little olive oil as possible.  Toast it until it's slightly
browned. Remove from heat and reserve.

Marinate the steaks in lime juice, water, and salt for 1 hour.

Sauce: ======

In a grinder or mortar, put the toasted oregano, bay leaves,
allspice, peppercorns, cumin seeds, whole clove, salt, coriander,
cinnamon stick, fresh garlic clove, and sugar.  Grind thoroughly then
add toasted garlic.

Put the ground mixture in a saute pan and add 3/4 of a cup of
water, 1/2 cup of red wine vinegar, and simmer for 15 minutes.

Assembly: =========

Meanwhile, remove the steaks from the marinade, take off their
skins, cube, then pat dry.

Heat another saute pan, then add olive oil.  Put the swordfish
into the pan and saute until it has a light, golden crust.

Reserve the swordfish on a serving dish.

Pour the oil from the pan and deglaze the pan with 1/4 cup red
wine vinegar.  Add herb and vinegar sauce to deglazed pan and bring
to a boil. Add a touch of water if sauce becomes too thick.

Spoon sauce over fish and garnish with sweet onions and red
chilies. Serve at room temperature.
