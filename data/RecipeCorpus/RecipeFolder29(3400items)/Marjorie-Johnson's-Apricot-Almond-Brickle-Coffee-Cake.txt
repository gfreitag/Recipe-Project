Yield: 2 servings
MMMMM--------------------------THE CAKE-------------------------------
1 1/2 ts Baking Powder
1 1/2 ts Baking Soda
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Light Sour Cream
1/2 c  Dried Apricots, chopped
1/2 c  Almonds, Toasted, chopped
1/2 c  Almond Brickle Chips
12 tb Butter, at room
-temperature
1 1/2 c  Granulated Sugar
4 lg Eggs
1 ts Vanilla Extract
1 ts Almond Extract
3 c  All-Purpose Flour
MMMMM-------------------------THE GLAZE------------------------------
2 ts (To 3) Milk
1/2 c  Confectioner's Sugar
1/4 ts Almond Extract
* Preheat oven to 350 F.

1. Grease and lightly flour two 9-inch layer cake pans. Set aside.

2. Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and the sugar
until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, and beat well after
each addition. Beat in the vanilla and the almond extracts.

3. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together. Stir
the flour mixture, alternating with the sour cream, into the butter
mixture, beginning and ending with the flour.

4. Put 1/4 of the batter in each pan. Sprinkle half of the apricots
over each batter, followed by 1/4 of the nuts and 1/4 of the brickle
chips. Divide the remaining batter and pour it into the pans,
followed by the remaining nuts and chips. Bake for 35 to 40 mins.

5. Meanwhile, prepare the glaze by combining the sugar and almond
extract in a small bowl and add just enough milk to make it
spreadable consistency.

6. Cool the layers on racks. Drizzle the cooled cakes with the glaze.
