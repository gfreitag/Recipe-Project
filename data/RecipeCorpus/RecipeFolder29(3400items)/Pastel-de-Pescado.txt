For Pastry: ===========

In a mixing bowl or processor, combine the flour, the salt, and
sugar. Cut in 1/2 cup of butter until crumbly.  Add just enough cold
water so that they dough holds together in a ball.  Seal in plastic
wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

For Filling: ============

Working in small batches, blanch the Swiss chard in boiling
salted water.  Drain, rinse under cold water, and thoroughly squeeze
dry. Chop the chard finely and set aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and oil in a large skillet.  Add
chilies, garlic, ginger and saute over medium heat for 1 minute
without browning. Add the onion, and cook with stirring until
translucent. Add the nutmeg, cumin and thyme and cook 1 minute
longer. Add Swiss chard and stir until completely dry.  Remove from
heat, season to taste with lemon juice and salt, and set aside.

To Assemble: ============

Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to a very
large circle 1/4 inch thick.  Fold into quarters and carefully
transfer the dough to a buttered 9-inch springform pan.  Unfold the
dough and gently fit it into the bottom of the pan, leaving a
generous overhang. Brush the bottom and sides with some of the egg
yolk mixture and set aside to dry for about 10 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 F. Spread half of the Swiss chard filling
over the dough and arrange fish fillets on top.  Cover evenly with
remaining Swiss chard.  Gently gather up the edges of the dough in
the center, and twist it into a topknot, pinching the knot with thumb
and forefinger. Leaving a knot 2 to 3 inches high, cut off the excess
dough. Brush with the remaining egg yolk mixture and sprinkle with
mustard seeds, and cut several slashes around the top.

Place on a baking sheet and bake until golden, 1 to 1 1/4 hours.
Cool completely on a rack before removing sides of the pan.  Cut into
wedges and serve at room temperature.
