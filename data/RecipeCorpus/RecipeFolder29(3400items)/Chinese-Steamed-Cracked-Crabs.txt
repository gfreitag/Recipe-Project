It's crab season here in the San Francisco bay area.  Heap and heaps
of luscious Dungeness crabs are showing up all over the place.
Steamed or live++take your pick!  I was in Oakland's Chinatown last
weekend shopping at the Sam Yick gorcery and saw a couple of boxes of
still- kicking Blue crabs for a buck seventy-nine a pound.  Good
eatin' ahead! 1 crab, live in the shell, about 2 pounds 2 green
onions, bruised and cut in half 2 quarter sized slices of ginger 1
tablespoon Shao Hsing wine or dry sherry Ginger, Green Onion and
Vinegar Dipping Sauce

Kill and clean the crab.  Place it, top shell down, on a heat-
resistant plate.  Scatter the onion, ginger and wine on top of the
crab. Put the crab and plate into a preheated steamer. steam over
high heat for 15 minutes. Remove and cool. Disjoint and crack the
crab and arrange on a platter. Dip the meat into the dipping sauce
and eat with green onions and ginger. Use the tip of the leg to dig
out the meat. Serves 2 as a light meal. GINGER, GREEN ONION and
VINEGAR DIPPING SAUCE 4 tablespoons finely shredded green onion 2
tablespoons finely shredded ginger, preferably young ginger 1/4
teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 5 tablespoons vinegar 3 1/2
tablespoons peanut oil Scatter green onions in a shallow saucer. Top
with the shredded ginger.  Sprinkle sugar and salt evenly over the
ginger.  Pour the vinegar over the ginger.  Heat the oil until it's
hot but not smoking, and pour it over the mixture.  It should sizzle
lightly.  If it is too hot, let it cool. Makes about 2/3 cup. Joyce
