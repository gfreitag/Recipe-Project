Since 1918 local trenchermen have counted on Arnaud's to provide
them with fine food for all occasions.  Chef Claude Aubert provides
them with old favorites from the Creole repertoire as well as new
sensations from his native country of France.  In the tradition of
great French cooking, Chef Aubert relies on the best ingredients at
hand, and as a knowing chef he blends the familiar with the exotic to
give Arnaud's food is a special quality.

The first course in this menu combines artichokes, a favorite of
New Orleanians, with escargots, in a tomato sauce.  The complementary
flavors constitute a comforting vehicle for the snails.  The bourride
is a familiar fish stew in France, not often seen in this country.
When made with Gulf of Mexico fish such as pompano, trout and drum,
and freshwater species like catfish and crawfish, however, the dish
seems as natural as gumbo. This contrapuntal blend of familiar and
exotic gives signature to Chef Aubert's delicious food.

If Gulf fish are unavailable to you, take a page from the Chef's
book and use the freshest varieties available to do a little creating
of your own.
