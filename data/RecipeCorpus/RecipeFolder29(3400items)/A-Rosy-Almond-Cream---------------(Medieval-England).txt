Categories: Medieval, English, Desserts, Nuts/grains, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
3 oz Sugar
1 tb To 2 tblspns wine vinegar
-(don't worry-- used by
-ancient Romans to emphasise
-the flavor of the fruit)
Crystallised petals to
-decorate
2 1/2 c  Milk
2 oz Ground almonds
1 1/2 oz Rice flour
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Ground ginger
12 oz Berries or currants,
-fresh or defrosted
Put milk in pan with ground almonds, bring to a boil, and simmer for 3
minutes. Meanwhile, mix the spices with the rice flour in a pan, then
gradually add the hot almond milk. Cook them together till the mixture
thickens slightly. Add the fruit with the sugar. Cook them all
together gently till the sugar is melted and the fruit well mixed--
it should not totally disintegrate although it should be partially
mushed. Add the vinegar to taste and spoon the dessert into glasses.
Chill for a couple of hours but serve at room temp., decorated with
another berry or with a crystallised rose or violet petal.
