Pat salmon dry with paper towels.  Dip 1 side of each piece in
flour, shaking off any excess.

Heat the clarified butter in a large skillet over medium-high
heat. Working in batches if necessary, saute salmon floured side
down, shaking the skillet occasionally to break the fish loose of the
bottom, until golden ( 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.)

Carefully turn salmon and brown the second side.

Transfer to warm serving plates, blotting up any excess fat from
the fish.  Keep warm.

Pour off butter from the skillet and add wine, scraping up any
browned bits.

Add cream, anchovies and tomato and boil until very lightly
thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.

Lower heat and swirl in butter, 1 or 2 pieces at a time.

Add chives and adjust seasonings to taste.

Pour sauce over the fish, and garnish with broccoli florets, and
serve.
