Set aside at room temperture for approximately 2-3 hours or
refrigerate overnight. Meat will look wet. Pat dry but don't remove
rub. Pre-heat gas grill on HIGH for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to MEDIUM
and place meat on center of grill. Close cover and grill for 10-15
minutes; turn meat over and grill for an additional 10-15 minutes for
medium-rare. Use tongs. Don't pierce meat with fork, so as to retain
