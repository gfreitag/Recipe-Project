Preheat the oven to 375 F. Grease muffin cups or line paper liners.

To make the topping, combine the sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a small
bowl. Drizzle the melted butter over the mixture and combine with a
fork or your fingers until it forms crumbs. Set aside.

To make the batter, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt,
and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar and beat
until fluffy. Beat in the egg, then add the milk gradually, beating
after each addition. Add the batter mixture a small quantity at a
time, beating after each addition. Beat until smooth.

Fold the blueberries into the batter, stirring gently by hand until
they are evenly distributed. Spoon the mixture into muffin tins and
sprinkle each cake with a little crumb topping. Bake 40 to 45 mins,
or until golden brown.
