Title: Bileela (Hot Wheat Cereal)
Categories: Middle east, Breakfast, Nuts/grains
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Sugar
1 c  Kamh (whole wheat grains)
7 c  Water (4 to 7 cups)
In a heavy 3 to 4 quart saucepan, combine the whole wheat grains
and 4 cups of water.  Bring to a boil over high heat, cover tightly,
reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 2 hours, or until the
grains burst open and become soft.  Check the pan frequently after
the first hour of cooking and stir in more water, a cup at a time, as
needed.
Add the milk and sugar, cover again and simmer for 20 minutes more,
or until the wheat grains are very tender and the cereal has the
consistency of oatmeal.  Serve hot, with additional sugar and milk or
with honey and cream.
