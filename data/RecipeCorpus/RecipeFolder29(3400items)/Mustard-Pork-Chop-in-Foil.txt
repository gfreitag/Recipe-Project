Stephen Ceideburg
1/4 ts Vegetable or olive oil
1    Thick slice onion
5 oz Boneless pork chop
Hands on time: 5 minutes. Baking time: 20 to 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Tear heavy-duty foil to make a 12-inch square; smear foil with oil.
Place onion slice on half of foil. Trim fat from chop, spread both
sides with mustard, place on onion, sprinkle with salt and pepper,
top with rosemary if desired. Close foil to form triangle, roll edges
and crimp firmly to seal, turning sealed edges upward. (A surprising
amount of juices are generated during cooking.) Place in baking pan
(lest those juices leak) and bake 20 to 30 minutes, depending on
thickness of chop, or until chop is no longer pink in center.

Transfer packet to dinner plate, open and turn chop with onion and
juices onto plate. Serve, if desired, with potato or sweet potato
baked in same oven.
