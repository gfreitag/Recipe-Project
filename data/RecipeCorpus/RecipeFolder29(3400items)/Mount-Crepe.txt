In large, deep bowl or food processor, blend together flour, cocoa,
milk, egg substitute, egg white, fructose, and melted margarine. Let
stand 20 mins.

Spray 10-inch, non-stick frying pan. With ladle, pour about 5 Tbs
batter into hot pan. Swirl batter evenly in pan. Pour off excess
batter after pan bottom is covered with batter.

Cook crepe over medium heat until bottom is cooked. Turn crepe over
and continue cooking until done. Invert crepe on clean kitchen towel.
Continue until all crepes are done. While crepes are cooling, prepare
filling.

FILLING: In large bowl, mix cheese, yogurt, and peaches (reserve 3
slices for top of mount). Mash peaches as you mix filling, adding
aspartame and enough juice from peaches to make a smooth filling.

TO ASSEMBLE: Set first crepe in center of serving dish. Spread
lightly with filling. Continue until all crepes have been stacked.
Top with final layer of peach-cheese filling, and place remaining
peach slices on top. You can arrange top slices in flower shape for
elegance. Slice crepe "mount" carefully with sharp or serrated knife
into 8 servings.
