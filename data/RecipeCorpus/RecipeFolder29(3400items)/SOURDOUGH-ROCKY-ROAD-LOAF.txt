The same flavor treat, but beats cold ice cream on a winter's night...

Dissolve yeast and a teaspoon sugar in lukewarm water; set aside until
bubbly.

Measure out sourdough starter in a large mixing bowl. Add yeast
mixture to starter with milk, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, salt egg and
oil.  Mix well. Add enough flour until the dough pulls away from the
side of the bowl. Turn out onto floured surface and knead until
smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, turning
once.  Cover with a cloth and let rise in a warm place free from
drafts, about 1 to 2 hours or until doubled in size.  Punch down
dough, roll out to 1/2 inch thickness in a 14" by 10" rectangle.
Spread with softened butter.  Mix 1/3 cup granulated sugar, brown
sugar and cinnamon together.  Sprinkle over butter along with nuts,
chocolate chips and marshmallows.  Roll up jelly-roll style, seal
edges and shape into a loaf.  Place in a well greased loaf pan, cover
with a cloth, and allow to rise for 1 to 2 hours. Bake at 375 for 40
to 50 minutes or until done.  Allow to cool in pan for 5 minutes
before removing. Makes 1 loaf.
