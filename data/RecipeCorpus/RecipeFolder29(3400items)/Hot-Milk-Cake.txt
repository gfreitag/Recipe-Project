Title: Hot Milk Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Countyfairs
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Sifted All-Purpose Flour
1 tb Vanilla Extract
1/4 ts Salt
2 ts Baking Powder
1 c  Milk
4 tb Butter
4 lg Eggs
2 c  Sugar
NOTE: From Helen Hubbard (her recipe), Be sure to put the baking
powder in last. If you DON'T, the cake will not rise properly. She
also says it is very nice with fruit or juice plain with a cup of hot
tea.

* Preheat oven to 350 F. Thoroughly grease a 9- or 10-inch tube pan.

1. Heat the milk and butter together in a saucepan until the butter is
melted and mixture is lukewarm. In a large bowl, beat the eggs until
foamy. Add the sugar gradually, as you continue to beat and beat
until light and fluffy. Add the milk-butter mixture. Add the flour
and beat well, then beat in the vanilla and salt. Last of all and
most importantly, add the baking powder.

2. Pour and scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Bake 45 mins, or
until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a
rack. Additional suggestions from Helen: Cake could be dusted with
confectioners' sugar or drizzled with chocolate glaze or even
strawberry slices that are sugar-sprinkled. On occasion, she also has
added a tsp of orange or lemon juice and a tsp of grated orange or
lemon peel to the basic batter.
