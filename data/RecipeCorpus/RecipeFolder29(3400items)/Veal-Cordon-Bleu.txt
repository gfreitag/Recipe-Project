Title: Veal Cordon Bleu
Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Flour, seasoned with salt
-and pepper
1 lg Egg, beaten with
1 tb Oil
1/2 c  Breadcrumbs
1/4 c  Oil
5 tb Butter
4    Thick veal chops
1/4 c  Chopped Prosciutto
-or other good ham
1/4 c  Grated Swiss cheese
1 cl Garlic, crushed
2 tb White wine
Salt and pepper to taste
With a sharp knife cut a slit into each chop to make a pocket. Mix
the ham, cheese, garlic, salt, pepper and wine. Spoon the mixture
into the pockets and seal slits with toothpicks. Refrigerate for 30
minutes. Coat the chops with seasoned flour and brush with beaten egg
and oil, then roll in bread crumbs. Heat oil in frying pan. Add
butter and when it is foaming, cook the chops until tender, brown and
crisp. Drain on paper towels. Deglaze the pan with a little more
white wine and pour over the chops.

This technique works very well with pork chops and chicken breasts as
well. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   04-01-95
