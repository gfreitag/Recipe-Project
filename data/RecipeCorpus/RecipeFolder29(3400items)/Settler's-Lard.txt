This is made from the inner or kidney-fat of the hog.  It should be
cut up in small portions, and boiled down on a slow fire.  Let the
fat boil till all the oil is extracted; but be careful not to let it
burn.  When it has ceased to make a noise, be on the watch; it is
ready to strain off into clean, dry jars.  The best, are the
stone-jars, with covers to them.

**MY NOTE**  This is amazingly close to how I have rendered lard.  I
use my biggest roasting pan, cut the chunks of fat up, and put it in
the oven at 225.  The part about her saying when it ceases to make
noise is very true....  I also press the cooked stuff to get more
liquid out of it, and then pour it into a bowl.  I then let it sit
for a few minutes to let any impurities settle, then ladle it into
those little plastic margarine 1/2 pound containers.  I usually let
them sit on the counter until they have solidified, then store them
in the freezer.  It makes excellent oil for deep frying, and
regardless of what they say about cholestrol and stuff, it makes the
absolute best pie crusts.... Origin: The Canadian Settler's Guide,
