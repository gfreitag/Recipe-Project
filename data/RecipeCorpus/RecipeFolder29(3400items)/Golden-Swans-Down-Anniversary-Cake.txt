* Tip:  Process toasted almonds with sugar and orange zest in a food
processor for perfect texture.

Preheat oven to 350. Combine eggs, 1/4 cup sour cream and vanilla. Set
aside. Mix together dry ingredients and orange zest in a large bowl.
Add butter and remaining sour cream. Mix on low speed until
moistened. Beat on medium speed until creamy. Gradually add egg
mixture in thirds, mixing well after each addition. Spread batter in
prepred 9-cup fluted tube pan. Bake until tester inserted in center
comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes. Remove cake from oven. Poke holes
in top of cake. Brush with 1/2 of the Grand Marinier Syrup. Cool in
pans 10 minutes. Invert onto cooling rack. Brush with remaining
syrup. Cool before glazing with Chocolate Ganache.

GRAND MARNIER SYRUP:  Heat sugar, orange juice and Grand Marnier in a
small saucepan until sugar is dissolved.

CHOCOLATE GANACHE GLAZE:  Process chocolate in food processor or grate
until very fine. Scald cream in a small saucepan. Add grated
chocolate. Cover and let sit for 5 minutes. Gently stir until smooth.
If necessary, stir on low heat to melt chocolate. Place cake on
cooling rack with waxed paper underneath to catch the drippings. Pour
ganache glaze over cake.
