Categories: Diabetic, Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
Egg wash for pies and tarts
1    Basic pie crust, bottom
3/4    Inch wide lattice strips
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 ts Almond extract
6 c  Fresh dark sweet cherries
1 2/3 tb Cornstarch
3/4 c  Fruit sweetener
Prepare the bottom crust according to the directions. The lattice
strips can be cut in advance and refrigerated, covered with plastic.
Remove them 10 minutes before they are needed for ease in handling.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Pit the cherries. In a medium size
bowl, mix all filling ingredients, except the pitted cherries. Toss
the cherries in the mixture to coat them evenly. Pile the cherry into
the unbaked crust. Prepare the egg wash and brush it onto the rim of
the crust. Top the pie with interwoven lattice strips. Trim from the
edge of the pie any pastry extending beyond the edge of the pie pan,
and seal by pressing lightly with the tines of a fork. Brush the
lattice top with egg wash. To bake the pie, place it on a baking
sheet in the preheated oven, directly on the oven floor of a gas oven
or on the lowest shelf of an electric oven. Bake at 350 for one to
one and one quarter hours, until the crust is golden and the filling
is bubbling to within three inches of the center of the pie. Cool the
pie before cutting and serving. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On
