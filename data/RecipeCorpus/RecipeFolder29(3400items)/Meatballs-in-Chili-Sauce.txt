Hi Robert!

RP> I've seen 'veggie burgers' mentioned on tv, but can't find RP>
them in the stores. Anybody got a quick, easy and tasty RP> recipe ?

Here's on that we like. They freeze well, so I make a big batch,
varying the spicing on my day off. Great for those days when I'm in
"Dinner is what falls out of the freezer first" mode. You might find
morning star farms veggie burgers near the frozen breakfast foods.
They have sausage and hamburger imitations.
