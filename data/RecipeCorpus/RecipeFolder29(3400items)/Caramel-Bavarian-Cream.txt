Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
3    Beaten egg yolks
1 ts Vanilla
1 tb Dark rum
1 c  Whipped cream, unsweetened
- and unflavored
1 tb Gelatin
1/4 c  Water
3/4 c  Caramelized sugar
1 c  Hot milk
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
Soak the gelatin in the water. Prepare 3/4 cup Caramelized sugar.
When the sugar is slightly cooled put it in the top of a double
boiler with the hot milk, sugar and salt. Stir over hot water until
dissolved. Pour part of this mixture over the beaten egg yolks and
return the sweetened yolks to the double boiler. Stir and cook the
mixture over hot water until it coats a spoon heavily. Stir in the
soaked gelatin until it is dissolved. Cool the custard. Add the
vanilla and rum. Fold in the whipped cream. Place the bavarian in a
wet mold. Chill at least 12 hours or more before serving, if you plan
to unmold it. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   04-05-95
