Title: Fresh Fruit Ices
Categories: Healthy, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
See below
Just put the fruit in a blender and blend until smooth. Then pour
into a bowl or shallow pan and place in the freezer. Stir the mixture
every 15 minutes or so to break up ice crystals and prevent the
mixture from freezing solid too fast. These take at least 1 1/2 to 2
hours and 6 to 8 vigorous stirrings to finish.

Don't prepare them more than 8 hours in advance, since ices are best
served right from the freezer. If you must work ahead, cover the
finished product tightly with foil to prevent flavor loss. Serve in
chilled dishes, garnished with mint leaves or fresh fruit sections.
For special treats, try the following flavor combinations. Each
recipe serves 2.

FENNEL-HONEYDEW ICE: 1 cup honeydew puree; 1/4 tsp. fennel seed; 1/4
tsp. lime juice.

BERRY ICE: 1 cup berry puree (use raspberries, blueberries or
strawberries); 1/3 cup water; 1 tbsp. honey; 1/2 tsp. lemon juice.

NUTMEG-PEACH ICE: 1 peach, sliced; 3 tbsp. nonfat yogurt; dash grated
nutmeg.
