Lightly grease an 8 x 8 baking pan.

In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar and eggs, mixing well for 1
minute.

Beat in the melted butter.

Add the milk and mix well.

Slowly add the dry mixture until all is moist.  Do not over-mix.

Mom's Notes.  This is my neighbor Frank's recipe.  It is really good.
It is not grainy like most corn bread is. If you like corn bread, you
should try this one. One change he sometimes makes, is to replace the
milk with orange juice.  I haven't tried it that way, but he said it
is delicious. Submitted By CAROLYN STEWART   On   03-27-95
