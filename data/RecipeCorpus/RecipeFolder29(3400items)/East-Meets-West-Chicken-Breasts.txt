Flatten chicken breasts so that they are even and are not thicker

Mix yogurt and soy sauce in a shallow bowl.  Mix sesame seeds and
bread crumbs on a small plate.  Dip each chicken breast half in the

Place on baking rack.

Bake for 15 minutes.

While the chicken is baking, in a small bowl, mix the raspberry
preserves, soy and horseradish together.  The sauce may be served at
room temperature or heated until warm in the microwave (about 45
seconds on 100% power).

To serve, place a chicken breast on each plate and drizzle with the
raspberry sauce.
