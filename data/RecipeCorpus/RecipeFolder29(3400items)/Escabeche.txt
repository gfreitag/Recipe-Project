Yield: 4 servings
Pepper
Olive oil
1 1/2 lb Fish
Salt
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1 sm Bell pepper, seeded & diced
1/2 md Onion; sliced
Angostura Bitters -=OR=-
Dry Vermouth
6 oz Lemon juice  ) these are
6 oz Orange juice ) fluid oz
6 oz Olive oil    ) 4 to a cup
1    Ripe avocado; peeled sliced
1 lg Orange; sliced
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
1/2 md Onion; peeled & sliced
1    Avocado; peeled & sliced
Season the fish. Leave for half an hour then cook in olive oil until
golden brown on both sided. Do not overcook. Put into a dish.

Heat all marinade ingredients, except bitters or vermouth, and let
them boil together for a couple of moments. Pour them over the fish.
Add Vermouth to taste, or bitters, and a little salt, though this
will most likely not be necessary. Cover when cold and leave in the
refigerator overnight. Add extra slices of avocado pear and onion
just before serving.

Apart from the juices, which take the place of vinegar, and the olive
oil, the quantities of the other flavouring ingredients are variable.
The important thing is that the fish should be covered; and that you
should find the balance of flavours agreeable to _your_ taste. A
beautiful dish, particularly if you use a pink Spanish onion, to
contrast with the orange, deep green and soft pistachio green of the
other ingredients. the juice will be slightly jellied. A most
refreshing dish.
