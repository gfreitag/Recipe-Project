For Chili-Corn Sauce: =====================

Coarsely chop the reserved trimmings from your onions and
peppers; set aside.

Cut the whole onion and peppers into a neat fine dice; set aside.

With a small paring knife remove the corn kernels from the cob,
reserving the cobs, and combine kernels with the diced vegetable
mixture.

In a large heave saucepan heat 2 tablespoons of oil until very
hot but not smoking.  Add the meat cubes and stir over high heat,
shaking the pan, until the meat is nicely browned (about 7 minutes.)

Add the chopped vegetable trimmings to the meat and toss 4 to 5
minutes.

Add the garlic to the mixture and toss 2 minutes.

Add the chili powder, ground red pepper and black pepper to the
mixture and stir for 2 minutes.

Add the vermouth and reduce the mixture for 2 minutes.

Add the Veal Stock and reserved corncobs and bring the mixture
to a boil, stirring.

Boil mixture gently, skimming any fat from the surface
frequently, until the stock has reduced to a light syrupy consistency
(20 minutes or more.)

Add the cream and continue to boil gently, skimming, until
liquid is reduced and coats the back of a spoon (about 8 minutes or
longer.)

Remove and discard corncobs.

Strain half of the mixture into a clean saucepan, add corn and
vegetable mixture to strained liquid, boil for 2 minutes, and set
aside.

(Combine unstrained half and solids from strained half and
reserve as a stew for another meal.  Further cooking may be
necessary.)
