SALT DILL PICKLES ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My mother, a superb pickler,
maintains that the crunchiness and good green color of pickled
cucumbers are achieved by first pouring boiling water over the
cucumbers, blanching them for a few seconds and then refreshing them
immediately with cold water.

2 lb Small Cucumbers (1kg); blanched and refreshed 2 oz Dry Dill
Stems and Flower Heads (50g); bruised 5-6 ea Fat Cloves Garlic;
peeled; quartered 1 ts EACH: Black Peppercorns, Allspice and Mustard
Seeds 4-5 ea Bay Leaves x Water x Salt 3-4 ea Small Hot Chillies (to
taste) x Vine Leaves

Wash and blanch the cucumbers. Refresh and arrange in a crock or a
large glass jar in layers, interspacing them with dill, garlic and
spices. Pour cold water, to cover, over the cucumbers in the crock.
Pour out the water into a measuring jug. Salt with 1 tb (30g/1oz)
salt for each 2 cups water (500ml/1pint). Dissolve the salt well in
the measured water and pour over the cucumbers. Place vine leaves on
top, then fit a heavy plate or wooden cover inside the crock and
place a weight on to hold the cucumbers submerged. Leave in a
warmplace to ferment. Skim as needed during the fermentation period.
When bubbles disappear, the pickles are ready use; this can take up
to 2 weeks or in a warm, sunny place it can take as little as 4-5
days. When fermentation stops, keep the pickles in a dark, cool place
or refrigerate.
