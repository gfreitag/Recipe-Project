Title: Potato Noodles
Categories: Pasta, Side dish, Aust/german
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/8 ts Salt
1/3 c  Olive oil for sauteing
1 lb Idaho potatoes
3/4 c  Flour
1    Egg
1.  Boil the unpeeled potatoes until tender and refrigerate
overnight. The next day, peel the potatoes and force them through a
fine sieve.

2.  Mix the sieved potatoes, flour, and egg to form a dough. Season
with nutmeg and salt.  Roll the dough into a finger-thick cylindrical
shape and cut it into inch-long sections.  Roll each section into
noodles thick in the middle and tapering at the ends.

3.  Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil.  Add the noodles and simmer for
about 5 minutes, until the noodles rise to the surface. Remove the
noodles with a slotted spoon and refresh in ice water.

4.  Heat the olive oil in a skillet and saute the potato noodles over
medium high heat until golden brown.

Serves 6.
