Title: Mary's Kolaces (Yeast Dough Fruit-Filled Cookies)
Categories: Cake/cookie, Countyfairs
Yield: 72 servings
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Lemon Rind, grated
6 c  (To 7) All-Purpose Flour
1/2 c  Butter, melted
Mary's Poppy Seed Filling
(separate recipe)
1 1/2 c  Ground Nuts
2 pk Active Dry Yeast
1/4 c  Lukewarm Water
1 tb Sugar
1/2 lb Butter
2 c  Milk
3    Eggs
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Grated Mace
1. Sprinkle the yeast over the water; add the sugar and let sit until
bubbling, about 10 mins.

2. In heavy saucepan, heat the butter and milk over moderate heat
until the milk is warm and butter is melted.

3. In a bowl, bread maker or in a heavy-duty electric mixer, beat the
eggs and sugar together until the mixture is light and thick. Add the
milk-butter mixture, yeast, mace, salt and lemon rind.

4. With wooden spoon, or in a bread mixer equipped with a dough hook,
beat in the 6 cups of flour, 1 cup at a time. If the dough seems
liquid, beat in some or all of the remaining flour. When the dough is
too thick to mix with a spoon, or it pulls away from side of the
mixer, turn it out on a floured board. Knead 8 to 10 mins until the
dough is smooth and no longer sticky. Place in a butter bowl, turn to
coat completely, cover with kitchen towel and let rise in a warm
place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hrs.

5. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and cut into 6 large
pieces. Divide each piece into 12 small ones.

6. Form walnut-sized balls by rolling dough on surface with your palm.
Place 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Brush each ball with
melted butter. Let rise 30 mins or until almost doubled in size.

* Heat oven to 400 F.

7. With your finger, press a nest in the center of each ball, so that
the dough forms a shell 1/2 inch thick. Fill with your poppy seed
filling. Top with a sprinkle of ground nuts. Let rise until light,
about 10 mins. Bake for 10 to 15 mins, or until browned.
