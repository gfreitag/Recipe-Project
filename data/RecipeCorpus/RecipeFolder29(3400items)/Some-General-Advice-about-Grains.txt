What Kind of Pot to Use
Yield: 1 info

Non-stick   a cleanup blessing. Make sure it has a tight lid so no
steam (or very little) can escape. How deep? How wide? A deep pan is
best to keep the grains covered with liquid/ A wide-bottomed pan
cooks faster, but needs to be checked more frequently to see if you
have the proper amount of water.

Cooking the Grain

Over medium-high heat. bring the liquid to a full rolling boil before
adding the grain. Add the grain and bring it to a boil again, then
cover, reduce the heat to simmer   or use a flame tamer, particularly
for electric stoves that don't adjust from high to low immediately.

When Is It Done

It's done when the grain reaches your personal preference. Some
prefer a very soft grain, while others favor a more chewy bite.
However, all the liquid should be absorbed.

When cooking, don't stir. Grains bruise easily and tend to get sticky.
Don't peek while they cook. Steam will escape each time the lid is
lifted.

If the grain is not to your taste after the liquid has been absorbed,
add some boiling water and continue to simmer. Bite-test a grain to
see if it is done. The underside of a tight pot lid collects
moisture, so after cooking, slip a piece of paper towel between the
pot and the lid so that the accumulated moisture will be absorbed.
Let it stand for 5-10 minutes before fluffing with a fork to separate
the grains. If some water still remains on the bottom of the pot,
just drain it off.

How Much to Cook

The cooking charts in this book are based on one cup of dry grain,
which may yield more cooked grain than some recipes require. Keep any
leftover cooked grain in the freezer for future use.
