Title: Rpm Patties
Categories: Countyfairs, Bbq/grill
Yield: 3 servings
1 ts Pepper -- freshly ground
1 ts Ground Cinnamon
3    Spiced Apple Rings -- diced
3    Spiced Apple Rings -- whole
1 lb Ground Pork
2 tb Sugar
2 tb Soy Sauce
1 tb Horseradish -- grated
1. Mix all the ingredients together lightly but thoroughly, except the
whole spiced apple rings. Do not compress the meat too much or the
patties will be tough.

2. Shape the mixture into 6 patties. Place each apple ring between 2
of the patties and pinch the edges together to seal in the ring.

3. Place the patties on foil on the grill so that they cook just
enough to firm and hold their shape, then transfer directly to grill
rack. Cook, turning once, until done; an instant-read thermometer
will read 160 F.

Note: these patties may also be broiled or fried.

Mary Ann Lienhart-Cross (the M in RPM) says that this recipe was a
collaboration of 3 people [R(oger), P(atty), and M(ary)] for a Pork
Cookoff at the ELKHART COUNTY 4-H FAIR of Goshen, In. Fair dates: End
of July for 9 days. BTW. It won there and at the Indiana State Fair.
