For the Stuffing: =================

Soak the bread in heavy cream and crush the peppercorns.  In a
bowl, mix the ground meat and mushrooms with the bread and cream
mixture, peppercorns, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

Place 2 heaping tablespoons of stuffing into the pocket of the
chicken leg.  Fold the breast flap over the stuffing, then fold the
thigh flap over the other flap.  Press the globi, fold-side down, on
the table so that the leg bone sticks straight up forming a pear
shape. Place the leg with bone up in a greased baking pan and brush
with melted butter.

Bake in 350 F oven for 30 - 40 minutes or until the chicken is
cooked through.

For the Sauce: ==============

In a small saute pan, put a 1/4-cup of cognac and peppercorns.
Heat briefly, cover, then remove from heat.

Meanwhile, remove the chicken from the oven and place it in a
warm place.  Pour the fat out of the chicken baking pan and place the
pan back on the burner.

Deglaze the pan with a 1/2-cup more cognac.

Mix together the veal demi-glace and cream and add to the baking
pan. Bring the mixture to a boil.  Continue boiling until it becomes
thickened, then strain through chinois.

Add the rest of the cognac to the peppercorn/cognac sauce.
Flame the sauce, then combine it with the baking pan sauce and reduce
slightly. Adjust the seasonings.

To Assemble: ============

Place each globi on a dinner plate and surround it with sauce.
Garnish with par-boiled mushrooms and other vegetables.  Place a
frill on the knob end of each globi and serve.
