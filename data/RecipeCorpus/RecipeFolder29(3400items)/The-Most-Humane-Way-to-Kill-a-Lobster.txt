Title: The Most Humane Way to Kill a Lobster
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 info  The lobster's blood, or life fluid, flows almost randomly through the
body spaces...Any large incision made in the shell allows the liquid
to drain out (it forms a pale blue clot); the lobster then slowly
suffocates because the main function of this fluid is to transport
oxygen around to body tissues. Thus, plunging a knife between the
eyes is slow suffocation, as is plunging a knife in the back where
tail joins chest. This last is not only slow suffocation, but, worse,
it severs the intestine, dumping its contents over the t ail meat.
The only knife work that can be effective is plunging it in  inch
across the underside, close to the chest; this severs the spinal cord
and kills the lobster, as well as draining out its life fluid.

Many humanitarians, including for a while the International Society
for the Protection of Animals, have been under the delusion that
setting lobsters in cold water and bringing them slowly to the boil
was the kindest treatment. NO! This, again, is slow suffocation plus
death by drowning.

The most humane way to deal with live lobsters is to plunge them head
first and upside down into boiling water. Since their circulatory
functions are centered at the back of the head, they die within a few
seconds. Then, if you are to cut up the lobsters before proceeding to
cooking, remove them in about a minute, when limp. Otherwise,
continue to boil them for the amount of time specified in the recipe.
