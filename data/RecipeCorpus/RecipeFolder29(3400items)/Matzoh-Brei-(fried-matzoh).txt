Title: Matzoh Brei (fried matzoh)
Categories: Breakfast, Jewish, Passover
Yield: 2 servings
Salt, sugar, cinnamon
Oil for frying
2    Matzoh
2    Eggs
1/4 c  Milk
Soak the matzoh under running water for several minutes.  You want it
soft, not mushy.  My Mom breaks the matzoh up first, I don't. Anyway,
break the matzoh up into bite size pieces. Beat the eggs with the
milk and add seasonings.  Just like French toast. Soak the matzoh
pieces in the beaten eggs until the eggs are soaked up. Fry in hot
oil turning occasionally, sort of like scrambled eggs. Take your
time, you want them hard on the outside.

Serve as is or with powdered sugar or syrup. Credit: Unknown.
