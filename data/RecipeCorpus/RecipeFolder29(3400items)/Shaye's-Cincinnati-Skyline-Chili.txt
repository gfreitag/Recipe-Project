TIMESAVING FOOTNOTE: I am now a firm believer in buying the "Shredded
Beef" at your supermarker butcher counter, which dispenses almost
entirely with the chopping process.  Another alternative is to find a
butcher with a "chili plate" for a coarse grind.  Make sure you let
it cook at least 3 hours --6 or 12 hours is even better.
