Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease an 8-inch square or 9-inch round baking
pan.

In a small mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, half of the
sugar, and the butter until blended. Press into the bottom of the pan.

In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, gradually adding the
remaining sugar, until smooth. Add the eggs and blend thoroughly.
Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 30 mins. Let cool, then add
the filling. Chill and serve with whipped cream if desired.

FILLING: In a small saucepan over moderate heat, combine the sugar,
cornstarch, and nutmeg. Gradually add the water and stir. Add the
butter and raspberries and bring to a boil, stirring gently. Boil for
2 mins, or until thickened.
