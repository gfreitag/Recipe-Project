Categories: Cake/cookie, Vegetables
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 c  Shortening
1 c  Sugar
2    Eggs, separated
1/2 ts Almond extract
1/3 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Milk
4 c  Cut rhubarb
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Quartered marshmallows
1 3/4 c  Sifted flour
2 ts Baking powder
1/8 ts Salt
Cook rhubarb over low heat until juice begins to run, add sugar and
marshmallow and mix well.  Simmer about 10 minutes and pour into
greased cake pan.  Sift flour, baking powder and salt together.

Cream shortening with sugar until fluffy.  Add egg yolks and
flavorings and beat thoroughly.  Add sifted dry ingredients and milk
alternately in small amounts beating well after each addition.  Beat
egg whites until stiff but not dry and fold into batter.  Pour over
rhubarb mixture and bake in a 350 degree oven for 40 to 50 minutes.

Loosen cake from sides and bottom with a spatula and turn out onto
cake plate.  If marshmallows are very fresh, do not add to rhubarb
until just before cake batter is poured on. Randy Rigg
