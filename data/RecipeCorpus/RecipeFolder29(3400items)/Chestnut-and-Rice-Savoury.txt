Title: Chestnut and Rice Savoury
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 serving
2 oz Dried chestnuts
2 tb Water
1 ts Yeast extract
1 ts Tomato paste
1 sm Onion
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 sm Tomato
1 c  Mushrooms
1/2 c  Brown rice, cooked
Cover the chestnuts with boiling water and leave them to soak for
several hours, then cook them until tender.  (If the chestnuts are
soaked in warm water in a wide-rimmed thermos flask, or in a warm
cupboard, them may be tender enough not to require more cooking.)

Chop the onion and saute it in the oil in a saucepan for about 3
minutes.

Skin and chop the tomato.  Slice the mushrooms.  Add them to the pan
and cook for a further 3 minutes or so.

Add the rice and chestnuts to the pan and stir well.  Then add the
water, yeast extract and tomato paste.  Mix together very thoroughly
as it heats up so that the yeast extract is amalgamated evenly into
the mixture. Continue cooking over a gentle heat until all the
ingredients are well heated.
