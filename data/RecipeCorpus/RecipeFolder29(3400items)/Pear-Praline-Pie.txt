Preheat oven to 350 F.

First prepare the topping by mixing the brown sugar, pecans, and
flour in a bowl. Cut in the butter and blend until the mixture
resembles very coarse cornmeal.

Prepare the filling by tossing the pears with the sugar, flour, lemon
zest, ginger, and salt. Stir until the pears are well coated.

Sprinkle 1/4 of the pecan mixture over the pie crust. Top with the
pear mixture and sprinkle with remaining pecan topping.

Bake for 40 mins. Serve hot or cold, with ice cream or whipped cream,
if desired.
