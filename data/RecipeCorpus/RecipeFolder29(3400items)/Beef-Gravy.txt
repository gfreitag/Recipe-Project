Title: Beef Gravy
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 2 1/2 cups
-browned in the oven
6 tb All-purpose flour
MMMMM---------------------------STOCK--------------------------------
-peeled
2 tb Tomato paste
1 ts Whole black peppercorns
1/2 ts Dried mustard
2 cn (10oz ea) beef broth
2 c  Water
1/2 c  Dry red wine or sherry
Any meat scraps you have
-in your refrigerator
2 lg Carrots, cut in chunks
2 lg Stalks celery
-cut in chunks
2 lg Onion(s)
-cut in thick slabs
3    Whole garlic clove(s)
Put the flour in the oven for a few minutes. When it's light brown,
it's done.

Put the meat scraps into a large saucepan along with all the other
ingredients. Bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and let simmer for a
couple of hours. Skim off the scum on the surface occasionally. The
stock should reduce by at least a quarter.

When the stock has been reduced, pour it through a strainer lined
with a clean dish towel. Check the seasoning. If there's enough time,
let the stock cool.

Pour  cup of the meat drippings into a medium saucepan. Scrape up as
much as you can of the browned bits on the bottom of the pan and add
them to the drippings. Over low heat, stirring with a whisk, begin to
heat the drippings and browned bits.

When the drippings begin to sizzle, stir in the 6 tbs. of browned
flour. Whisk until the mixture begins to form a paste. Pour in 2 cups
of hot stock all at once. Immediately start whisking until the stock
and flour mixture are combined. Keeping the heat low, simmer the
mixture for about 5 minutes. Turn up the heat slightly and cook,
whisking often, until the mixture reaches a gravy-like consistency.
Check the seasoning and serve immediately.
