For the Chicken: ================

To bone the chicken, producing two servings (or globi) per
chicken, begin by cutting down along the breast bone, scraping along
the bone to keep the meat intact.  Disjoint the wing and continue
boning along the wishbone.

Turn the chicken over and cut along the back bone, carving out
the meat from the bone.  Disjoint the thigh and continue to remove
the entire half of the chicken with the skin intact.

Cut off the wing at the first joint leaving only the shoulder
bone attached to the carcass.  Scrape the meat off of this remaining
wing bone to remove the bone, leaving meat and skin attached to the
half chicken.

Remove the thigh bone, leaving meat attached to the chicken
half. Cut around the knob end of the leg, releasing the skin and the
tendons. Press the leg meat and skin firmly toward the thigh so that
1 1/2 to 2 inches of the leg bone is exposed.  Cut the knob off the
end of the leg bone.

Repeat the process with the second half of the chicken.

Marinate the chicken meat for one hour in cognac, thyme and bay
leaf.
