2 ts Salt
2 ts Olive oil
2 ts Dried yeast
1 c  Warm water

let rise until doubled.  Turn the dough onto an oiled 10 1/2" X 15

dimple the top of the dough with your fingertips & sprinkle with some
extra salt & 2 ts of oil.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until golden.
Slide off baking sheet onto a rack & let cool for a few minutes
before eating warm or at room temperature.

VARIATION: Focaccia Dolce. Substitute 2 oz raisins & 1 oz pine nuts
for the olives, herbs & garlic.  Soak the raisins in warm water for
30 minutes before using & toast the pine nuts.
