Whether you are celiac or not, this is a very good quiche and not
much more difficult to make than one with a pastry crust. (her
publisher is a celiac)

To make the crust: mix the shredded potatoes and oil in a bowl, then
press into a buttered quiche dish or a 9 inch pie plate. Bake at 425F
for 15 minutes.
Spread the onion over the bottom of the half-baked potato crust.
Cover with cheese, then spread the hsm on top of the cheese. Beat the
eggs until light and blend in the milk. Pour slowly over the ham. Add
more milk if necessary to almost fill the dish. Bake at 350F for
about 30 minutes, or till quiche is golden brown. This quiche reheats
quite nicely, if necessary. Source: Edna Stabler, shared by Anne
