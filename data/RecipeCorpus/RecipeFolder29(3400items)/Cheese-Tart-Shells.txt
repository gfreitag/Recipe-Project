1 1/2 c  Unbleached Flour
1/2 c  Vegetable Shortening
5 oz American Cheese Spread;1 Jar
CHEESE TART SHELLS: Combine the shortening and cheese spread in a
medium bowl.  Cut flour into the cheese mixture with two knives until
well blended.  Shape into a roll 1 1/4-inch in diameter and 12 inches
long. Wrap completely in waxed paper or plastic wrap. Refrigerate for
1 hour or longer.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the dough
from the refrigerator and unwrap.  Slice 1/8-inch thick. Using 12 (2
3/4-inch) muffin cups or 3-inch tart pans, place 1 slice of dough in
the bottom of each.  Overlap 5 slices around the outside of each.
Gently press together. Pierce the bottoms and sides with a fork. Bake
18 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven until lightly browned. Cool in
the pans on a rack and gently remove the shells when cold to the
touch. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   03-30-95
