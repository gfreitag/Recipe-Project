Title: White Chocolate Mousse - Great Chefs
Categories: Basics, Masterchefs
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Rum, white
1 lb Chocolate, white, melted
Creme fraiche
Raspberry puree
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Water
8 lg Egg whites
6 lg Egg yolks
In a saucepan, heat the sugar and water until the mixture forms
a soft ball.

Put the egg whites in the bowl of a mixer, and beat them until
medium stiff (beating first on medium, then on high).

Add the sugar and water (soft ball stage) from the saucepan to
the egg whites and continue to beat briefly until a stiff meringue is
formed.

Place the egg yolks in a metal bowl and beat them over heat with
a whisk.  Add rum to the egg yolks - still beating over heat.  Fold
the egg yolks into the egg whites.  Fold the melted chocolate into
the egg mixture. Refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours.
