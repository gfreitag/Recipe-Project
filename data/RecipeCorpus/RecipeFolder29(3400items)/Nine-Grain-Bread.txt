Title: Nine Grain Bread
Categories: Fatfree, Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  White flour
1 3/4 c  Whole wheat flour
3/4 c  9-Grain cereal
3 ts Yeast
1 1/3 c  Skim milk
3 tb Honey
2 1/2    To 3 T. orange juice
Concentrate

Mix in the order recommended by your breadmaker.  I know most
breadmakers only require 1.5 t. yeast, but ours calls for 3 t. yeast.
