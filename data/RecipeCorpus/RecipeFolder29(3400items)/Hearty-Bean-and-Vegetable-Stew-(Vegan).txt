Title: Hearty Bean and Vegetable Stew (Vegan)
Categories: Crockpot, Soup/stew, Vegetarian
Yield: 12 servings
MMMMM----------------------DEAN ORNISH M.D---------------------------
1/2 c  Mushrooms - diced
1    Onion - diced
1 ts Basil, dried
1 ts Parsley, dried
1    Bay leaf
3    Clove garlic - minced
1 ts Black pepper - ground
1 c  Rice or pasta - cooked
1 lb Beans, assorted, dry
2 c  Vegetable juice
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/3 c  Soy sauce
1/3 c  Apple or pineapple juice
Vegetable stock or water
1/2 c  Celery - diced
1/2 c  Parsnips - diced
1/2 c  Carrots - diced
Sort and rinse beans, then soak overnight in water.

Drain beans and place in crockpot.  Add vegetable juice, wine, soy
sauce, and apple or pineapple juice.  Cover with vegetable stock or
water; the amount added depends on whether you prefer a soup (more
liquid) or a stew (less).  The juice adds just a tad of sweetness and
the soy sauce adds depth and the tang of salt.

Cook at high for 2 hours.  Add vegetables, herbs, and spices, and
cook for 5-6 hours at low until carrots and parsnips are tender.
When tender, add rice or pasta and cook for one additional hour.

Notes: For beans use 3 or 4 kinds, such as: black, red kidney, pinto,
baby lima, lentil, and green and/or yellow split peas.

Most soups and stews can be prepared in a crock pot.  Just decrease
the liquid ingredients (not as much liquid will evaporate from a
closed slow-cooker) and let it rip for 6 or more hours.
