Yield: 1 1/4 pounds
2    Egg whites
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Nuts; coarsely chopped
1/2 c  Syrup, light corn
2 1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Water
Combine corn syrup, sugar, salt, and water in saucepan.  Cook over
medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved.  Cook,
without stirring, to firm ball stage (248 degrees) or unitl a small
amount of syrup forms a firm ball which does not flatten when dropped
into very cold water.

Just before syrup reaches 248 degrees, beat egg whites with electric
mixer or rotary beater until stiff but not dry.  Pour about one-half
of the syrup slowly over egg whites, beating constantly.  Cook the
remainder of the syrup to soft crack stage (272 degrees) or until a
small amount of syrup separates into threads which are hard but not
brittle when dropped into very cold water.

Add syrup slowly to the egg white-syrup mixture, beating constantly.
Continue beating until mixture holds its shape.  If mixture becomes
too heavy for beater, continue beating with a wooden spoon.  Add
vanilla and nuts.  Drop from tip of spoon onto waxed paper.
