Crush enough of the strawberries to make 1 cup. In a saucepan,
combine the crushed berries, sugar, cornstarch, and water. Cook over
moderate heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens.
Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.

Slice the remaining strawberries and place them in the pie shell.
Pour the cooked mixture over the top and refrigerate for 3 hours, or
until the pie is set. Serve with whipped cream if desired.
