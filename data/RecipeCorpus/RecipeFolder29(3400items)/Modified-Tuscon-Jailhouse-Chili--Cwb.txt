MMMMM------------------------PREPARATION-----------------------------
Dice onion, and puree garlic. To puree garlic, put a clove under a
knife blade, hit the blade, which will remove the peel, then dice the
clove, add a little salt, and crush the diced clove under the blade
of a heavy knife until pureed. Saute onions in olive oil; when onions
clear, add garlic puree. Stir quickly (less than a minute) to avoid
onions browning.  Remove sauteed onions and garlic from skillet.
Brown beef in skillet; drain well. Add sauteed onions and garlic,
stir quickly, then pour into crockpot. Add all other ingredients and
stir. Cook eight hours on low, four hours on high.

OPTIONAL: Best cooled and re-heated. Garnish with grated sharp Cheddar
cheese and sliced green onions; serve with corn chips.

To use dried instead of canned beans, soak two and two-thirds cups
(one pound) pinto or kidney beans overnight in three times their
volume of water. Add salt to the water the next morning, and
slowly bring to a boil.  Boil ten minutes, cover, and let simmer
for two hours until beans are tender.  Drain before using in
recipe.
