Pieces
pn Salt
2    Eggs, beaten
1 c  Brown Sugar
3/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking Powder
Preheat oven before you get started. You are using a "quick oven" and
the setting is 375 F.

Combine the batter quickly, and drop spoonfuls 2-inches apart onto
baking sheets. Bake 4 to 5 mins; cool on racks.

NOTE: This recipe is from the 1911 edition of the DEERFIELD FAIR
COOKBOOK. One of the testers suggests adding 1 tsp of any flavoring,
such as vanilla, almond, lemon or orange. She also used a buttered
baking sheet.

These must be watched CLOSELY; they burn easily.
