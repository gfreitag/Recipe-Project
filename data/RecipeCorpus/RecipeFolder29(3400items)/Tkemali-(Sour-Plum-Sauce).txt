Title: Tkemali (Sour-Plum Sauce)
Categories: Russian, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
Chopped
1/4 c  Coriander Seed, Fresh Green
Or 1 Tbs Dried
1/2 sm Hot Red Pepper -- finely
Chopped
1 ts Salt
24    Plums (Golden Gage) (Unripe)
OR
36    Plums (Japanese)
3 md Garlic Cloves -- finely
Chopped
1 1/2 c  Coriander Leaves And
Feathery Tops -- finely
Wash the plums, then prick the skin of each one. Put in a large
enameled pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the
heat and simmer for at least an hour. The long slow simmering process
helps to extract the fruit's pectin which makes the tkemali nice and
thick. Add water as necessary to maintain a volume of approximately 1
to 1 1/2 qts. Once well cooked, cool and put through a sieve or
colander. Separate the pits from the skin and pulp that won't go
through, then put the skin and pulp in a food processor and
liquidize. Add to the sieved plum sauce. Return to the pot and add
the garlic, coriander, hot pepper, and salt. Bring to a boil,
stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, and cook for 8 to 10 mins.
Put immediately into a sterilized quart jar and keep in the
refrigerator. The tkemali will keep for months in a cool place.
(Author's Note) Mirabelle or Japanese plums are identical to the
Alycha plum used by Georgians.
