** Bouquet garni is a cheesecloth bag (or some other porous
material) in which you've put some rosemary, thyme, bay leaf, and
crushed peppercorns.  There is no rule for how much of each you'd use.

Tomato Sauce: =============

To prepare the tomatoes, drop them briefly into boiling water,
then remove and plunge them into cold water and peel.

Remove the seeds and chop the tomatoes.

Melt butter in a saute pan and add minced shallots.  Saute,
covered, for 5 minutes over low heat.  Add tomatoes and bouquet
garni. Season to taste.  Cook covered over medium heat for 30 minutes.

Remove shallots and bouquet garni, then puree.  Reserve sauce.

Pasta Roll: ===========

In a saute pan, melt the butter and add the diced ham and
scallions. Cook over medium heat for about 2 minutes until scallions
are soft.

Beat the cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, Ricotta cheese, and
pepper together until smooth.

Add the sauteed ham and scallions to the cheese mixture; then add
eggs, and mix well.  Cover and refrigerate at least 2 - 3 hours.

Spread half of the filling on one of the pasta sheets - leaving a
half-inch border around the edges.  Brush the border with a little
melted butter.

Place a layer of sliced Prosciutto to cover the filling mixture
then beginning at one of the short ends of the pasta, roll it up.  Do
not roll too loosely or the poaching liquid may seep into the
cheese/meat mixture.

Wrap roll in a double thickness of cheesecloth and tie each end
securely with string.

Repeat for second pasta sheet.

Fill a large saute pan with chicken stock.  Bring the stock to a
boil and add pasta rolls.  Reduce the heat to simmer and cook gently,
turning occasionally, for 25 minutes.

Drain and cool before removing string and cheesecloth.  Cut each
roll in half-inch thick slices.  Pour some of the tomato sauce into a
pool on the bottom of individual serving plates and arrange the
slices on the plates.

Garnish with chopped chives.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
