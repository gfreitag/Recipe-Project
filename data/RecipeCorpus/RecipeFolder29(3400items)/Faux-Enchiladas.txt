Title: Faux Enchiladas
Categories: Tex/mexican, Microwave, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 serving
1/2 c  Diced onions
1 tb Red chile powder (to taste)
1/2 pk Corn tortilla chips
1/2 cn Enchilada sauce
1 c  Shredded cheese
Place 1/2 of the chips in a microwave save casserole bowl.  Sprinkle
all of the cheese (Longhorn, cheddar, anything works), over the
chips, and pour 1/2 of the enchilada sauce over everything. Microwave
on High for about 2 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and
bubbly. Remove, add the rest of the chips, and blend in.  Pour the
remaining enchilada sauce over it, microwave on high for another
minute or so, just until hot. Do not overcook.

Doing this in 2 steps is very important.  If you do it all in one,
you will end up with an "Enchilada Soup" with very little texture,
and not terribly appetizing.

Note:  This yields one LARGE serving.  May be easily doubled.  A
fried egg and/or sour cream on top is very nice, too, on *any*
enchilada. Cooked meat (chicken, etc.) may be added in step 1 if
desired. Other spices, esp. cumin and cilantro may be added.  Depends
on the nature of the enchilada sauce you use.  Some need more beefing
up than others. TO BOB NEWMAN  Submitted By JOHN FARROW  SUBJ PIE
