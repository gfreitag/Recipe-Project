Title: Pickled Hot Red Peppers
Categories: Vegetables, Pickles, Hot/spicy
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Bay leaf; torn into quarters
2 c  Distilled white vinegar
2 c  Water
2 ts Salt
4 tb Olive oil, or as needed
2 lb Small, fresh hot red peppers
4    Garlic cloves; peeled
-=OR=- More if you like
8    Whole allspice
24    Peppercorns
RINSE AND DRAIN THE PEPPERS; trim stems to a stub. Pack the peppers
into 4 wide-mouthed pint canning jars, dividing them equally. As the
peppers are packed, scatter among them a share of the seasonings:

In each jar place: 1 clove garlic split; 2 whole allspice; 6
peppercorns; and a piece of bay leaf.

Combine the vinegar, water and salt in a stainless-steel or enameled
saucepan and heat the mixture to simmering. Pour the hot solution
over the peppers, covering them completely and leaving 1 inch of head
space. Remove any bubbles and add liquid if necessary to maintain
head space. (If there should be insufficient solution to cover the
peppers, make more in the same proportions; no harm will be done if a
few moments are required to do this.) Add enough olive oil to each
jar to cover the surface of the liquid, about 1 tablespoon. Seal the
jars with new two-piece canning lids, according to manufacturer's
directions and process for 15 minutes in a boiling water bath. Cool,
label and store the jars. The peppers are good to eat after 2 weeks,
but they will be better after at least a month's rest in the jar.
