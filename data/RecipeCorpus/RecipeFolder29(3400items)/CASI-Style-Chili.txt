Appreciation Society, International (CASI) chili-cookoff winners tend
to use blnded chili powder and also Jalapeno chiles, which are
usually removed before serving. The beef is cubed, and masa, which is
a flour made from ground dried corn and available in Latin Markets,
is used to thicken the chili.

Brown the meat and onions in the oil or fa.

Add the tomato sauce, beer, beef stock, chiles, cumin, garlic, black
pepper, and 2 tablespoons of the Chili Powder. Simmer the chili over
a low heat for 2 hours until the meat is tender.

To thicken, make a thin paste of the masa and water. Quickly stir
this into the chili -- if done too slowly it will lump.

Add the remaining Chili Pepper and Paprika. Simmer for an additional
15 minutes. Remove the jalapenos and serve.
