Title: Red Lobster's Cheesy Garlic Rolls (Kathy's)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
6 oz Grated mild cheddar cheese
2 1/2 lb Baking mix *
21 oz Cold water
*RL uses a specially made product, but Bisquick buttermilk baking mix
is a decent substitute

Mix together above ingredients (by hand, an electric mixer will NOT
work) until JUST combined --do not overmix. Scoop with a 1 1/2 ounce
scoop onto 2 parchment-lined baking sheets (20 per sheet), and bake
in a 450 convection oven for 4-5 minutes.  Rotate the sheets, and
bake another 4-5 minutes. (Note, a commercial convection oven cooks
about 25 percent faster than a home oven -- for the same results,
increase the baking time somewhat, but be careful not to overbrown
the rolls, they should be a light golden brown).

Remove rolls from the oven, and brush with garlic butter mixture
(again, RL uses a proprietary product, but you can make a decent
imitation by adding garlic powder, NOT salt) to taste, plus some
dehydrated parsley flakes to liquid margarine.  Do not add too much
butter to the rolls, or the garlic flavor will overpower the cheese.

For variations, increase the cheese to 8 oz. (better, and the way the
Lobster used to do it), or substitute about 5 oz. shredded Parmesan
(NOT the dried stuff that comes in a can) for the cheddar. The
Parmesan variation is excellent. IMHO, better than the original. As a
breakfast bread (or snack for the cook), you may also add 4-5 slices
of crisp cooked bacon to this.  In this case, brush with regular
liquid margarine instead of garlic butter.

Note: this is a half recipe for the ones made at the Lobster.  It
makes 40 rolls, which is a LOT for home use.  You might want to scale
it down somewhat.
