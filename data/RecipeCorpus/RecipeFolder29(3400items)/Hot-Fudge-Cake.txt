"Here's a wonderful way to top off a great meal...a rich, chocolatey
cake that's not overly sweet.  Mom served it with a scoop of ice
cream or cream poured over. I'd always have room for a serving of Hot
Fudge Cake." -- Vera Reid, Laramie, Wyoming.

In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, 2 tablespoons cocoa, baking
powder and salt.  Stir in the milk, oil and vanilla until smooth.
Spread in an ungreased 9-inch square baking pan.  Combine brown sugar
and remaining cocoa; sprinkle over batter.  Pour hot water over all;
do *not* stir. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 35-40 minutes.  Serve warm.
Top with whipped cream or ice cream if desired.
