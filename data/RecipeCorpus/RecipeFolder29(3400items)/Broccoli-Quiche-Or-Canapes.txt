1 pk Knorr asparagus soup mix* --

1 bn Broccoli -- cooked, chopped
1/3 c  Green onions, including tops

*Note: Knorr leek soup mix makes a good substitute.  The asparagus
soup mix is difficult to find.  If using the leek soup mix, reduce
the amount of chopped green onions slightly.

Mix filling together and pepper to taste.

For quiche: Pour into pie shell and bake at 325F for approximately 60
minutes. Makes one large quiche.

For canapes: Roll out pastry.  Cut into rounds with cookie cutter.
Place rounds in tiny muffin tins.  (Choose cookie cutter size such
that the pastry rises slightly above the top of the muffin tin.)
Press pastry into tins slightly with a shot glass.  Fill.  Bake at
350F for 20 minutes. Makes about 90 canapes.  Can be frozen.
