Categories: Ice cream, Desserts, Chocolate
Yield: 1 1/2 pints
3 c  Half and Half; or light
-cream, at room temp
4 oz Semisweet chocolate;
-finely chopped
4    Egg yolks
1/8 ts Salt
3/4 c  Sugar
2 tb Water
In medium bowl, whisk the yolks and salt until combined.  In heavy
medium saucepan, dissolve the sugar in the water over low heat. Bring
to a boil over medium high heat, stirring constantly, then boil
withoug stirring until the syrup turns a deep amber.  Remove the pan
from the heat and carefully stir in the half and half.  Return to the
heat and continue cooking, stirring to dissolve any hardened caramel.
Cook until the mixture comes to a gentle boil, 7 to 10 minutes. Whisk
about half the hot caramel mixture into the egg yolks to warm them.
Return the warmed eggs to the saucepan and continue cooking over low
heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture coats the back of a
spoon, about 10 minutes. Whisk in the chocolate until smooth. Strain
the ice cream base into a bowl and let cool to room temperature.
Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours or overnight.
Transfer the mixture into an ice cream maker and freezer according to
the manufacturer's directions.  Source: Mrs Fields I Love Chocolate
