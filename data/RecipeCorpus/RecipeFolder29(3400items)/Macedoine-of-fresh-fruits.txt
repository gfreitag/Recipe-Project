Title: Macedoine of fresh fruits
Categories: Fruit, Desserts
Yield: 1 batch
Liquor,a liqueur or wine
A variety of fresh fruits
Powdered sugar
These fruit and wine or liqueur combinations should be composed of
perfect, fresh, unblemished naturally ripened pared, seeded and
sliced seasonal fruits. Try strawberries, raspberries, peaches,
apricots, melon balls, cherries and/or nectarines. Be sure to prick
the fruits to allow the marinade to soak in. If you use raw apples or
pears marinade the slices for several hours in the wine or liqueur or
they will be too hard.

Some good combinations are: cognac and oranges, brandy with cherries
and clove-studded peaches and port with melon balls.  A macedoine is
usually served cold but may be flambe'ed at room temperature with
extra liquor.

Place the prepared fruit in layers in a crystal bowl with a
sprinkling of powdered sugar on each layer. Stir the fruit gently
until the sugar is dissolved then add for each quart of fruit 2 to 4
tbl cognac, brandy, rum or Kirsch. Serve over vanilla ice cream or
with cake. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   04-05-95
