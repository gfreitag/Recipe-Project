This recipe is in a lovingly written collection of traditional
recipes from old Jewish, Muslim and Christian Jerusalem families. The
sweet "kugel" is attributed to Rivka Vinegarten, the curator of Or
Chaime Museum in old Jerusalem. Her father, Rabbi Avraham Mordechy
Vinegarten, was the last rabbi of the old Jewish quarter at the
outbreak of the 1948 war.

KUGEL YERUSHALMI

Cook the noodles in plenty of boiling salted water for about 5 minutes
until they start to get tender. Drain and rinse in cold water.
Transfer into large mixing bowl. Heat the oil and sugar in a small
frying pan, carmelise it until it is dark brown but not burned. Pour
the caramel over the noodles and mix well. Add the rest of the
ingredients and combine throughly. Pour into a well-greased round
oven dish. Cover the dish tightly and bake for 1 1/2 hours in a
moderate oven (gas 5, 190C, 375F) or until the kugel crust is brown
and crisp. Allow to cool for a few minutes and unmould by inverting
the baking dish onto a flat tray. Serve hot, warm or cold.
