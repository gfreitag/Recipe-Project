Categories: Cake/cookie, Vegetables, Fruit
Yield: 4 loaves
1/4 ts Ground cardamom
1 1/3 c  Dark raisins
1/3 c  Chopped walnuts
8 tb Unsalted butter; softened
1 c  Granulated sugar
2    Extra-large eggs
2 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/4 c  Sour cream
1 3/4 c  Peeled, shredded carrots;
-about 4 medium carrots
1 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1 c  Unsifted cake flour
1/3 c  Unsifted whole wheat flour
1/3 c  Yellow cornmeal
1 1/4 ts Baking soda
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1/4 ts Ground allspice
Preheat the oven to 350F.  Butter and flour four 5x3x 2 3/4-inch loaf
pans.

Sift together the all-purpose flour, cake flour, whole wheat flour,
cornmeal, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger,
allspice and cardamom.  Toss the raisins and walnuts with 2 teaspoons
of the sifted mixture.

Cream the butter in the large bowl of an electric mixer on moderate
speed for 5 minutes.  Add the sugar and beat on moderately high speed
for 3 minutes.  Beat in the eggs, one at a time, blending well after
each addition.  Blend in the vanilla extract.  On low speed,
alternately add the sifted mixture in three additions with the sour
cream in two additions, beginning and ending with the sifted mixture.
Stir in the carrots, raisins and walnuts.

Pour and scrape the batter into the prepared pans, dividing it evenly
among them.  Bake the loaves for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a wooden
pick inserted into each loaf emerges clean and dry.  A baked loaf
will pull away slightly from the sides of the pan.

Cool the loaves in the pans on a rack for 3 to 4 minutes, invert onto
another rack and turn each rightside up.  Cool completely.  Store in
an airtight container.
