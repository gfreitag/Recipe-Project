Title: Caramelized Sugar
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 cup
1/4 c  Water
1 c  Granulated white sugar
1 tb Water
A marvelous flavoring: while its caramel flavor is strong, its
sweetening power is reduced by half. Heat the sugar in a very heavy
non-ferrous pan over very low heat. Add 1 tbl water. Stir constantly
with a long handled spoon for 8 to 10 minutes until the sugar is
melted and straw colored. Remove the pan from the heat. Add 1/4 cup
water VERY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY for a quick addition might cause an
explosion [of steam]. This safeguard against the spurting liquid will
also help make the syrup smooth. To make the syrup heavier, return
the pan to the heat for another 8 to 10 minutes until the sugar
mixture is the color of maple syrup.Toward the end of this process,
to avoid cooking it too dark, you may remove the pan from the heat
and let the caramelization reach a bubbling state from the stored
heat of the pan. Store the syrup in a covered jar unrefrigerated on a
shelf for future use. The syrup hardens on standing but is easily
remelted by heating the jar in hot water.
