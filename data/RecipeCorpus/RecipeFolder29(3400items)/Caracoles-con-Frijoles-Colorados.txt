*** To cook the kidney beans properly, soak 1 1/2 cups of dried kidney
beans in 4 cups of water overnight.  Drain, place in a pot of water to
cover by 2 inches, and bring to a boil.  Simmer, covered, over medium
heat until tender.

Heat 2 tablespoons of oil and 2 tablespoons of butter together
in a large skillet over a medium-high heat.  Add the shallot and
garlic and saute, stirring constantly, until lightly golden, about 3
minutes. Add the chilies, nutmeg, cloves, and cumin and cook,
stirring for 2 more minutes.

Add the snails to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally,
for 5 minutes.  Add the Pernod and cook until it evaporates.

Add the beef stock and bring the mixture to a boil and cook,
stirring, 2 to 3 minutes longer.  Add the beans and a 1/4 cup of
parsley, stirring briefly, just until the beans are heated through.
Remove from heat and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive
oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4
cup of parsley and serve warm.
