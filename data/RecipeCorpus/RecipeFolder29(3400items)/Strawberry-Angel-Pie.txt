Preheat oven to 250 F.

Prepare the crust. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy.
Add the cream of tartar and continue beating until the egg whites are
stiff.

Add the sugar and beat in. Spread the egg whites evenly over a 9-inch
pie plate. Bake for 20 mins, then increase the oven temp to 300 F and
bake an additional 40 mins.

In the meantime, prepare the filling. In a medium-sized saucepan,
combine the egg yolks, sugar, and lemon juice. Add the reserved
strawberry liquid and cook over moderate heat until mixture thickens.
Remove from heat.

In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water and let sit
for 3 to 4 mins, until the gelatin softens. Add to the filling
mixture along with the crushed strawberries and set aside to cool.

Beat the heavy cream until stiff and spread a thin layer onto the
cooled pie shell. Cover with the strawberry filling and top with the
remaining whipped cream. Chill well before serving.
