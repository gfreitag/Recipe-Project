Title: Dolly's Hot Chili Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
-removed, ground
5 1/2 c  Distilled White Vinegar
3 tb Pickling Salt
4 c  Sugar
20 lg Tomatoes, Red Ripe
-peeled and chopped
6 lg Onions -- ground
12    Hot Peppers, Seeds
Makes 6 pints.

1. In a large heavy nonaluminum kettle, cook the vegetables with the
vinegar and salt over moderate heat, uncovered, until reduced to about
half, about 2 hours.

2. Add the sugar and cook until thick, about 1 hour, stirring
frequently. The sauce should be bright red. Pour into hot sterilized
jars, seal, and process in a boiling water bath for 10 mins.

NOTE: If you want a less fiery sauce, use only a few hot peppers and
substitute ground sweet red bell peppers for the rest of the 2 cups.
Also, Dolly Kress says she adds the sugar late in the cooking process
so that the sugar does not carmelize and turn the sauce dark in color.
