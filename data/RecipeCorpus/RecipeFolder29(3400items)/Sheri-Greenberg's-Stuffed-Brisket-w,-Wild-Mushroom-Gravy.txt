FOR THE STUFFING: In large mixing bowl, stir together the broth & the
matzo farfel; mix well.  Let the mixture stand 5 minutes and stir in
eggs gently. In a skillet, cook the onion in the chicken fat over
moderately low heat, stirring until it is softened.  Add the carrot &
celery, cook the mixture for 5 minutes or until the carrot is
crisp-tender. Stir in the spinach. Cook the mixture over moderate
heat, stirring, until liquid is evaporated. Stir vegetable mixture
into the matzo-farfel mixture with the salt and the pepper.  Let
stuffing cool.

FOR THE BRISKET: Fill the brisket pocket with the spinach stuffing &
the pepper as follows: Place 1/3 stuffing in mixture in pocket, then
flatten stuffing with your hand to evenly distribute.  Place 1/2 red
pepper mixture over stuffing, pressing firmly. Cover with another 1/3
stuffing. Place remaining pepper pieces over 2nd layer of stuffing.
Top with remaining 1/3 stuffing.  Fasten the edges of the pocket
together with skewers or until top is browned. Transfer brisket top
side up & seasoned with salt & pepper, to rack of a foil-lined
broiler pan. Broil under a preheated broiler about 4" from the heat
for 6 to 10 minutes, or until top is browned. In a roasting pan
combine tomatoes, carrots, onions, the cheesecloth bag of spices, the
garlic and the broth. Add the brisket & braise it, covered, in the
middle of a preheated 350 F oven 2 hours. Add the red potatoes and
continue cooking 1-2 hours more, until it is fork-tender. Transfer
the brisket to a cutting board; let it stand, covered loosely with
foil for 20 minutes.  Reserve the braising mixture with the
vegetables. Discard the cheesecloth.

FOR THE GRAVY: In a heavy fry pan, brown the matzo cake meal over
moderately high heat, stirring constantly, for 5-7 minutes, or until
is golden brown.  Stir in 2 tb of chicken fat.  Add 3 c of the
reserved braising mixture until in a steady steam, whishing the
matzo-meal mixture until it is thickened.  If a smoother gravy is
desired, in the a blender puree the matzo-meal mixing in batches.  In
a skillet, saute mushrooms in the remaining 2 tb chicken fat over
moderate heat, stirring until the liquid they give off is evaporated.
Stir in the parsley & salt & pepper to taste.  Add the mushrooms
mixture to the matzo-meal mixture. Stir in enough of the remaining
braising mixture to thin the gravy to the desired consistency, and
heat the gravy until it is heated through. Serve the brisket, sliced,
with the gravy.
