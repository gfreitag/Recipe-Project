Make pasta as usual.  Meanwhile, heat a dutch oven over med. heat.
Add a little veg stock. Chop chilis into large chunks and saute in
stock (include the seeds) for about 2 minutes. Add chickpeas and more
veg stock and cook for 5-10 mins. Add the butterbeans with liquid and
the rest of the veg stock. Let simmer and liquid reduce some.

If chilis are not hot enough, puree in blender or chopper 1 or 2
jalepanos and add. Then add tobasco to taste.

I am drooling thinking about the leftovers in the fridge. I can't
wait to make and eat more.
