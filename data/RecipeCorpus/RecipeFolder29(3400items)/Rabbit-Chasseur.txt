Yield: 4 servings
Flour
Salt (to taste)
Pepper, white (to taste)
3 ea Bay leaves
1 tb Paste, tomato
2 c  Wine, white
2 ea Rabbits, cut into serving
-- pieces
1/4 c  Oil, peanut
1/4 c  Onions, chopped
1 lb Mushrooms, sliced

MMMMM------------------------BUERRE MANIE-----------------------------
2 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
Heat the peanut oil in a skillet and dust the rabbit with flour.
Brown the rabbit over high heat quickly then pour off the oil and
fats that accumulate.

Add onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, flour, salt, pepper, bay
leaves, and tomato paste and cook for 5 minutes.

Add the wine and bring the mixture to a boil.

Preheat your oven to 350 F.

Bake the rabbit in your oven for 45 minutes.

Remove the rabbit and thicken the sauce with the beurre manie
(you know that fancy chefs have to have fancy names ...  this is a
"roux".) For the beurre manie, simply melt the butter in a saute pan,
add the flour and then cook over medium heat for a minute or two to
take the "floury" flavor out of the mix.

Pour the sauce over the rabbit and serve.
