Title:  CANDIED YAMS
Categories: Side dish, Holiday
Yield: 6 servings
2 ts Vanilla
1/2 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
3 lb Med-size sweet potatoes
1 c  Sugar
1 1/2 tb Cornstarch
1 1/2 c  Water
Miniature marshmallows (optional)

Scrub sweet potatoes and cook in boiling water covered 25 to 40
minutes or just until tender (don't overcook).  Rinse under cold
water to stop cooking process; drain on paper towels.  Peel and set
aside.

Combine sugar and cornstarch in a small saucepan; stir in water until
smooth.  Cook over medium heat until thickened, stirring constantly
until sugar melts.  Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut potatoes into chunks or slices and
arrange in a single layer in a greased shallow 2-quart baking dish.
Pour sugar mixture evenly over potatoes. Combine brown sugar and
cinnamon; sprinkle evenly on top. Bake for 30 minutes. If desired,
drop some marshmallows over potatoes after 20 minutes of baking time.
