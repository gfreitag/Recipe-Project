Title: Berbere (Ethiopian Hot Pepper Seasoning)
Categories: African, Condiments
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Ground fenugreek seeds
1 1/4 c  Cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
1/2 c  Paprika
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1 ts Fresh ground black pepper
1 ts Ground ginger
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground cardamom
1/4 ts Allspice
1/2 ts Ground coriander
2 tb Salt
Here's the pepper seasoning used in Doro Wat.  I made the full amount
and it makes a lot.  I used whole spices, ground, then toasted. This
has a lot of potential as a basic seasoning.  I can easily see it
being used in a curry or other kinds of stews.

In a heavy saucepan, toast the following ground spices together over
a low heat for 4 to 5 minutes:  ginger, cardamom, coriander,
fenugreek, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and allspice.  Shake or stir to
prevent burning. Add the salt, cayenne pepper, paprika and fresh
ground black pepper and continue toasting and stirring for 10 to 15
more minutes.

Cool and store in tightly covered glass jar.  This will keep in the
refrigerator for 5 or 6 months.

Makes 1 1/2 cups.
