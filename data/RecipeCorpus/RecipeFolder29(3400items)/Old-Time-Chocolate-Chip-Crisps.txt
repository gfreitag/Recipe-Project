Title: Old-Time Chocolate Chip Crisps
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 5 dozen
2/3 c  Less 1 tablespoon granulated
-sugar
2    Extra-large eggs
2 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
16 oz Semi-sweet chocolate chips
-(2 1/2 cups or 1 12-oz bag
-plus 1/2 cup)
1 2/3 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1/3 c  Unsifted cake flour; plus
-1/2 teaspoon
1 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 lb Unsalted butter; softened
-(2 sticks)
1 c  Light brown sugar
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line two cookie sheets with lengths
of parchment paper.

Sift together  twice the all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking soda
and salt.

Cream the butter in the large bowl of an electric mixer on low speed
for 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally.  Add
the light brown sugar and granulated sugar; beat on moderate speed
for 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber
spatula to keep the mixture even-textured.  Beat in the eggs, one at
a time, blending well after each addition.  Blend in the vanilla
extract. On low speed, add the sifted mixture and mix until the
particles of flour are absorbed. Stir in the chocolate chips.

For each batch, drop rounded tablespoon-size mounds of dough onto a
lined sheet, spacing the mounds about 2 1/2 to 3 inches apart (9
mounds to a standard size sheet).

Bake the cookies for about 14 minutes, or until golden brown all
over. To remain crisp, the cookies must bake to an even brown color.
After 1 minute, transfer the cookies to cooling racks using a wide
metal spatula. Cool completely.

Store in an airtight container.  (The author wraps about 8 of these
cookies in clear cellophane, ties them on either end with ribbons,
and gives them to friends that way.)

VARIATION:  Add 1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts, pecans or macadamia
nuts.
