Title: Diabetic Banana Smunchies
Categories: Diabetic, Desserts
Yield: 26 servings
52    Graham cracker squares
2 c  Peanut butter
2 c  Ripe bananas
My suggestion:  Mash one banana into a measuring cup. Measure an equal
amount of peanut butter.

Mash very ripe bananas into a smooth paste.  Mix in peanut butter.
Chill well.  Drop 2 Tbsp. onto one square graham cracker, cover with
second graham cracker square. Freeze until ready to use.
