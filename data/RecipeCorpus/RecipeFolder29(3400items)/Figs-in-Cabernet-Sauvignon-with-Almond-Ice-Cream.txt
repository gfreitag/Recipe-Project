1.  In a saucepan, bring milk to a boil.  Place the sugar and egg
yolks in a mixer or bowl and whip well, then add vanilla bean paste.
Add milk to the sugar and eggs, while whipping.  Put this mixture
into a large metal bowl and heat slowly.  Using a wooden spatula,
move egg yolks around so they will not cook.  When puffed and mixed,
cool by placing the bowl in ice water.

2.  Peel the figs, cut in half and sprinkle tops with sugar.
Place them in a flat bowl with the wine (Cabernet Sauvignon or Port)
and marinate overnight (at least 2 - 3 hours).  Reserve marinade and
figs.

3.  Pour the Creme Anglaise into a saucepan, mix with 3/4 cups
of the almonds and pistachio paste, then process in an ice cream
machine.

4.  To serve, put the figs on a plate.  Shape the chilled Creme
Anglaise into quenelles and add to the plates.  Pour marinade over the
figs, add whipped cream mixed with sugar.  Sprinkle with almonds
(chopped) and serve.
