Tie up the brisket with strong thread or string. Cover it well with
water in a braising-pan and bring it to the boil. Skim. Salt the
water and add the spice and vegetables. Simmer until tender, for
about three hours. Remove the meat.
To make the sauce (1), first melt the butter in a saucepan, then
add the flour, cook a little and stir until smooth. Slowly stir in
the gravy, ketchup, browning, wine and sliced vegetables; bring to
the boil and simmer until the vegetables are tender. Season with
pepper and salt. Skim the fat from the surface and serve the brisket
in the sauce. Serve with pickles.
For a sharper sauce (2), put the parsley, onion and cucumbers into
the gravy, season, bring to the boil, and then simmer. Add the butter
rolled in flour to thicken the sauce, then the pickled walnut and the
capers. Simmer for 10 minutes and then pour over the beef.
