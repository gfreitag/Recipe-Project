Title: Basic Egg Ravioli Dough
Categories: Native amer
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Salt
1 ts Vegetable oil
3 c  Sifted all purpose flour
4    Eggs
Pour the flour into a mound on a flat working surface.  Make a
depression in the center with your hand that almost reaches through
to the board. Crack the eggs directly into the well and, with a fork,
whip in the salt and oil, mixing the flour in from around the edges.

Mix and knead the dough with your hands 8 to 10 minutes, until the
dough has a smooth and elastic consistency.  If the dough seems a bit
dry, add a little water; add a little more flour if it seems to
moist. Once you have obtained the desired consistency, cover the
dough with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator 15 minutes.

Divide the dough into handfulls and roll out each section to a very
thin, even, almost translucent thickness.

Use your imagination to cut the dough into any size or shape.  Any
filling can be used to make the ravioli.

Variation:  To make blue cornmeal ravioli, substitute  a combination
of 1 cup finely ground blue cornmeal adn 1 1/2 cups flour for the
flour in this recipe.  Increase the number of eggs to 5.
