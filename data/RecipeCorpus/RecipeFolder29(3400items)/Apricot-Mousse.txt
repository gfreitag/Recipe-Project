In a large saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Remove from the heat,
add the gelatin, and stir until dissolved. Set aside and allow to
cool.

Rinse the apricots well, halve and remove the pits. Puree in a
blender or food processor until smooth. Add the pureed apricots and
brandy to the cooled gelatin mixture and refrigerate until slightly
thickened (about 1 hour).

Beat the apricot mixture slightly, then fold in the whipped cream.

Transfer the mousse to a mold or serving dish and chill until firm.
