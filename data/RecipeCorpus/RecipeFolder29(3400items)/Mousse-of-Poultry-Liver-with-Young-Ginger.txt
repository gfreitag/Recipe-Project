Mousse: =======

Grind the onion and livers in a food grinder.  Add shallots,
thyme, garlic, parsley, and basil and process.

Place the processed mixture into a bowl, add eggs, lard, bread
crumbs (epice parisienne or cayenne pepper is optional), salt and
pepper. Mix well.

Put the mixture into a processor and blend it until smooth.  Add
about 1 cup of cream while blending.

Pour back into a bowl and adjust the seasoning: (Note: mixture
should be more liquid than thick -- add more cream if needed.) Strain
through chinois.

Pour mixture into chilled, well-buttered ramekins.  Put a layer
of water in a saute pan and place the ramekins on the pan.  Cover the
ramekins with buttered parchment paper, (butter side down) then bring
to a boil.

Place the boiling ramekins in a 450 F oven for 8 minutes.
Remove parchment and let set for 2 minutes.

Tomato Sauce: =============

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan.  Add onion and garlic and cook
until transparent.  Add bouquet garni.  Sprinkle onion mixture with
flour to thicken sauce.

Add tomatoes immediately and mix well.  Reduce the heat.  Add 1
cup of water and cook 20 - 30 minutes.  Salt and pepper to taste.

Remove bouquet garni and put mixture into a food processor and
blend thoroughly (do not blend too much or color will change).

Strain through chinois.  You may add 1 tablespoon of butter for
extra flavor if desired.

Assembly: =========

Unmold the mousse onto a serving plate.  Spoon tomato sauce over
the mousse.  Top with chopped chives, carrots, chervil, and
watercress. Garnish with bay leaf.
