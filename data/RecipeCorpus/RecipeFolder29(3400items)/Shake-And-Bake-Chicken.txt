Title: Shake And Bake Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Paprika
3/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Savory
2 ea Eggs
1 ts Black Pepper
3 ts Salt
1 ts Poultry Seasoning
Put 2 eggs in a bowl and mix well. Then dip each piece of chicken in.

Mix the rest of the ingredients real well. Use a plastic bag to shake
the chicken. You can fry your chicken in a frying pan, but I prefer
to put this in a casserole dish with a bit of water. Bake in a 325 F
oven for 2 hour, coverd. It comes out so tender, sorry Colonel but
this is much tastier!

Tested; We liked it, Lee
