Title: Vanilla Butter Wafers
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 2 servings
1    Egg
1/3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 lb (1 stick) butter
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
Adjust two racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat to 350
degrees. Cut aluminum foil to fit cookie sheets.

In the small bowl of an electric mixer cream the butter.  Add the
vanilla and the sugar and beat very will for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the
egg and beat well again for 2 or 3 minutes more.  On low speed add
the flour, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and beating only
until smooth.

Transfer the dough to a shallow bowl for ease in handling.

Use a slightly rounded teaspoonful of the dough for each cookie (keep
these small).  If you place the dough neatly and carefully the
cookies will bake into perfect rounds, which is the way they should
be.  Place the mounds of dough 3 inches apart on the cut aluminum
foil.  Slide cookie sheets under foil.

Bake for 12 - 15 minutes, until the edges are well browned.  Reverse
the sheets top to bottom and front to back once to insure even baking.

With wide metal spatula transfer the cookies to racks to cool.  Makes
2 dozen.
