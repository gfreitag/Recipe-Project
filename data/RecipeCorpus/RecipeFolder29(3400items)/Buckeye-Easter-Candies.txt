this sometime ago, and it started an echo-wide discussion on the use
of petroleum byproducts in foodstuffs...few rocks were thrown, and we
divided about equally on those who add the paraffin themselves and
those who buy the prepared product, and pretend not to know that the
paraffin is there...either way, these are good, and while you're at
it, you might as well go ahead and make a double batch...
