Consomme: =========

Wash and purge crawfish in 3 quarts of salted water for 30
minutes.

Rinse and drain the crawfish and place them in another pot with
9 cups of water and chopped vegetables.  Bring to a boil and add
seasonings.

Simmer for 30 minutes.  Do not boil too fast or the consomme will
become cloudy.

Dip the crawfish out of the liquid and allow them to cool.

Strain the consomme.

When crawfish are cool enough to handle, remove meat from shells
and return to the strained consomme just before serving.

Clarifying Cloudy Consomme: ===========================

Mix vegetables with egg whites.

When consomme is cold, add the vegetables and egg whites mixture
and bring to a boil, then lower the heat.  A crust will form on the
top. Let the consomme simmer until clear.

Strain by moving crust to the side and pouring through
cheese-cloth without breaking the crust.

Consomme en Croute: ===================

Put the crawfish tails and coarsely chopped truffles in an oven
proof cup and pour the consomme over them.

Cover each with a puff pastry top.  (Puff pastry may be
purchased in dough form at the supermarket.)

Bake at 425 F for 12 to 15 minutes or until the dough is browned
and crisp.
