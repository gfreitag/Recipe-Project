Boil noodles in plenty of salted water, drain well. Melt the butter
in a heavy bottomed pot. Add the noodles and fry for a few minutes
until heated through. Fold in the cheese and cream and heat for a few
minute more. The cheese should not cook as it becomes stringy and
unpleasant. Add salt and pepper, sprinkle with parsley, and serve
hot. Some strong, dry, grated cheese, such as parmesan or katchkaval,
can be sprinkled on top.
