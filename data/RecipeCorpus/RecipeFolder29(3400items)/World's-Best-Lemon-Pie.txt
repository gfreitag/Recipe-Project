"Mother's pies were always so wonderful, with tender, flaky crusts.
Through the year we enjoyed berry and apple pies, but in summer the
order of the day was lemon meringue - so light and refreshing!" -
Phyllis Kirsling

In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch, flour and salt.
Gradually stir in water.  Cook and stir over medium heat until
thickened and bubbly. Reduce heat; cook and stir 2 minutes more.
Remove from the heat. Gradually stir 1 cup into egg yolks; return all
to saucepan. Bring to a boil. Cook and stir for 2 minutes.  Remove
from the heat. Stir in the butter, lemon juice and peel until smooth.
Pour into pastry shell. In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites and salt
until stiff but not dry peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar until
soft peaks form. Spread over pie, sealing edges to pastry. Bake at
350 degrees for 12-15 minutes or until meringue is golden. Cool.
Store any leftovers in the refrigerator.
