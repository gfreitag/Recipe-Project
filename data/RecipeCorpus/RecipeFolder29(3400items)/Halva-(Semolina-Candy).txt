Title: Halva (Semolina Candy)
Categories: Middle east, Greek, Candies
Yield: 60 candies
2 c  Sugar
3 c  Milk; combined with 1 cup
;water
1 c  Olive oil
3 c  Semolina; or 3 cups white
;corn meal
In a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet, heat the oil over moderate heat
until a light haze forms above it.  Pour in the semolina in a slow,
thin stream, stirring constantly.  Reduce the heat to low and,
stirring occasionally, simmer for 20 minutes, or until all the oil
has been absorbed and the meal turns a light golden color.  Add the
sugar and then gradually stir in the milk and water mixture. Continue
cooking for about 10 minutes longer, stirring constantly until the
mixture is thick enough to hold its shape almost solidly in the
spoon. Watch for any sign of burning and regulate the heat
accordingly.
Pour the halva into an ungreased 6 by 10 by 2 inch baking dish,
spreading it and smoothing the top with a metal spatula or the back
of the spoon. Cool until firm.  Just before serving, cut the halva
into 1 inch squares.
