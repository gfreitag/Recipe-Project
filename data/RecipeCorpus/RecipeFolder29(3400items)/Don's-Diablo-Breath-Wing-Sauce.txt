Here is a recipe for a sauce for chicken wings. I made it up some
months back, and have given it to several friends. They all raved
about it. My family likes it and I hope that you do too! Enjoy! <
DON'S DIABLO BREATH WING SAUCE > Mix the vinegar with the butter then
add the garlic. Heat and add the cayenne flakes, Tabasco sauce, and
mustard. Bring to a boil and turn off the heat. Pour the
butter/vinegar sauce over the chicken pieces that you have deep-fried
in peanut oil, and serve. Makes sauce for 2-3 dozen wings **NOTE** I
use this on all parts of a chicken. Try hot chicken legs, breasts,
thighs, etc!!! From: Don Houston
