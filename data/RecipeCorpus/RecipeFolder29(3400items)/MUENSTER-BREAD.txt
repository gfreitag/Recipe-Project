"The recipe makes a
-beautiful round golden
-loaf.  With a layer of
-cheese
Peeking out of every slice,
-it's definitely worth the
-effort." - Melanie Mero
2 pk (1/4 oz. ea.) active dry
-yeast
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in milk.  Add butter, sugar,
salt and 2 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining
flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured board; knead until
smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl,
turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until
doubled, about 1 hour.  In a large bowl, beat egg and yolk; stir in
cheese.  Punch dough down; roll into a 16" circle. Place in a greased
9" round cake pan, letting dough drape over the edges.  Spoon the
cheese mixture into center of dough.  Gather dough up over filling in
1 1/2" pleats. Gently squeeze pleats together at top and twist to
make a top knot. Allow to rise 10-15 minutes. Brush loaf with egg
white. Bake at 375 degrees for 45-50 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for
20 minutes. Serve warm. Makes: 1 loaf From: "Taste of Home" Magazine,
