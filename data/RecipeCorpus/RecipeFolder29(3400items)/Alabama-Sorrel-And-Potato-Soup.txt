Title: Alabama Sorrel And Potato Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Potato
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Sorrel Leaves, chopped
1 c  (To 1 1/2) Milk
Salt And White Pepper,
Fresh Ground, to taste
Fresh Lemon Juice, to taste
Fresh Chervil Or Parsley,
Chopped, for garnish
2 qt Water
2 lb Idaho Potatoes, peeled and
Cubed
6 tb Butter
4    Leeks, White Part Only,
Rinsed Well, thinly sliced
1/2 c  Cold Water
1. Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan and add potato cubes.
Simmer, uncovered, until they are tender, about 25 mins.

2. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a heavy stainless steel or enamel
saucepan or soup pot, and add the leeks along with the cold water.
Allow the leeks to cook until they are limp and water has boiled
away, about 5 mins. (Do not allow the butter to sizzle or the leeks
to get the least bit brown.) Stir in the sorrel leaves and cook until
they wilt, about 1 min. (They will turn to an odd shade of green.)

3. Add the leeks and sorrel to the pot with the potatoes and their
liquid. Add the milk as needed, starting with 1 cup. Simmer a few
mins. Puree in blender (or processor) or mash and strain through a
sieve. If soup is too thin, then simmer longer to reduce; if too
thick, add more milk to thin. Season with salt and white pepper. Add
lemon juice to taste.

4. Pour piping hot into warmed bowls or a tureen for an exciting
start to a dinner party. Garnish with a sprinkle of chervil or
parsley.

SERVES 4 to 6.
