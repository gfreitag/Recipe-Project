makes even a large batch disappear first." - Rita Wilken

In a skillet over medium heat, saute the onion in butter until tender.
Transfer to a large bowl.  Stir in the next 8 ingredients.  Divide
between two ungreased 13x9x2" baking pans.  Stir 2 cups of water into
each pan. Cover and bake at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.  Uncover and
sprinkle with cheese.  Return to the oven for 5-10 minutes or until
cheese melts.
