Title: Homemade Chocolate Liqueur
Categories: Beverages, Chocolate
Yield: 1 servings
5 tb Unsweetened cocoa
1 ea Vanilla bean, split
1 1/2 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Water
3 c  Vodka
Combine sugar and water in small saucepan; cook over medium heat,
stirring occasionally, until mixture boils.  Reduce heat to low;
simmer, stirring occasionally, until sugar has completely dissolved.
Remove from heat; cool to room temperature.  Measure 1 cup of the
mixture; combine with vodka, cocoa and vanilla bean in clean 2-quart
glass container. Cover tightly; keep in cool dark place for 14 days,
shaking thoroughly every 2 days. Strain liqueur through dampened
coffee filter paper into clean glass container.  (Change filter paper
in mid-process or, if necessary, let drip overnight as cocoa residue
is very thick.)  Repeat straining process if residue remains.  Remove
vanilla bean.  Cover tightly; let liqueur age in cool, dark place for
at least 1 month.  About 1 quart. From: Hershey's Chocolate Treasury
