Categories: Chili, Countyfairs
Yield: 8 servings
1 qt Water
Salt
Ground Black Pepper
2 tb Chili Powder (To 3 Tbs)
2 cn Pinto Or Kidney Beans,
(15 To 17 Oz Cans)
3 lb Beef Chuck, Coarse Grind
2 md (Or 3) Onions
1    Bell Pepper
1    Clove (Or 2) Garlic
1/2 ts Oregano
1/4 ts Cumin Seed
2 sm Cans Tomato Paste
1. Brown the chuck in an iron kettle. (If you don't have an iron
kettle, you are not civilized. Go, git one.) Chop the onions and bell
pepper and add to the browned meat. Crush or mince the gralic and add
to pot. Then add the oregano and cumin seed.

2. Add the tomato paste. If you prefer canned tomatoes or fresh
tomatoes, press them thru' a colander. Add about 1 qt of water. Salt
liberally and grind in some black pepper, and for starters, 2 or 3
Tbs of chili powder. (You may use chili pods, if you wish.)

3. Simmer for 90 mins or longer, then add the beans. Pinto beans are
best; but kidney beans will do. Simmer for 30 mins more. Throughout
the cooking process, taste test from time to time and adjust
seasonings according to individual tastes. When it seems right to
you, let it sit for several hours. Heta as much as you require;
refrigerating the rest. Tastes better the 2nd day, much better on the
3rd day and according to Glen, "absolutely superb" on the 4th day. He
says you can't imagine the delights awaiting you after 1 week.
