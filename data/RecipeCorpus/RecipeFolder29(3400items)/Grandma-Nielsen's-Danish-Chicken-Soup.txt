1. Make the broth by placing the chicken in a large heavy pot and
cover with water by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, lower heat and cook,
skimming off foam. Cook until very tender. Remove chicken from the
broth.

2. Add to the broth the onions, celery, carrots, potatoes, salt and
celery salt. Cook until vegetables are just tender. Set aside.

3. Make the meatballs, by placing the beef in a large bowl. Add the
flour, salt, onion salt, pepper and eggs. Using your hands, mix well.

4. To a 6-qt kettle half full of water, add the salt, prepare the
meatballs by wetting your hands and rolling the meat mixture into
3/4-inch balls. Place them on a wet cookie sheet. When the water
reaches a rolling boil add a batch of meatballs; let them bob to the
top and continue boiling to 1 min. Remove with slotted spoon and
place in a bowl. Repeat until all meatballs are cooked. Keep the
cooking water to add to the broth if necessary.

5. Make dumplings: In a saucepan, bring the water, salt and butter to
a full rolling boil. Remove from heat and stir in the flour with a
wooden spoon until a stiff ball forms. Add the eggs, one at a time,
stirring. (For more dumplings, double this part of the recipe.)

6. To a 6-qt saucepan half full of water add the salt and bring to a
boil. Prepare the dumplings by wetting hands and rolling the dough
into 3/4-inch balls. Place on wet cookie sheet, ready to be dropped
into boiling water with a wet spoon. Cook in batches; when the
dumplings rise, remove them with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl.

7. When you are ready to serve, heat the broth with the vegetables'
add any or all of the meatball-cooking water. Bring to the boil and
reduce the heat. Add the meatballs and dumplings and just heat
through. Adjust seasoning, if necessary.

NOTE: The reserved chicken meat can be used for another meal. From
H.E. Elstermeier's grandmother.
