Yield: 24 servings

All-Purpose Flour
2    Eggs, slightly beaten
1/2 c  Milk
2 c  (To 2.5)
1 ts Salt

Wash & pitted
1. Mix the eggs and milk in a bowl; stir in 2 cups of flour and the
salt. Add more flour if necessary to make dough stiff enough to
handle but not sticky to touch. Knead well, and pat dough out on a
floured surface. Cut into 24 pieces, each about the size of a walnut.

2. Shape a piece of dough into a little cup  with your fingers. Wrap
it around a clean plum, covering completely, pinching to seal tightly.
Continue with remaining pieces and plums.

3. Let the dumplings rest 15 to 20 mins. Drop them into 4 inches of
boiling water and coo, covered, for 15 to 18 mins. Lift out with a
slotted spoon, letting them drain. It may be necessary to cook them
in 2 batches.

4. To serve hot, split and pour on melted butter, and sprinkle with
cinnamon and sugar. Note: Any leftovers can be crisped in butter for a
breakfast treat.
