Hold each chili with a fork over a gas flame, turning until
lightly roasted on all sides.  Place the chili in a bowl with 2 cups
of warm water, and soak for 20 minutes.

Prepare achiote oil by stirring together annato seeds and
vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat for 2 minutes.  Remove
from the heat and cool.  Oil will keep indefinitely, tightly covered,
in a cool place.

For Potato Mixture: ===================

Stir 1/4 cup achiote oil into mashed potatoes (reserve remainder
of the oil for another use).  Add lime or lemon juice and salt to
taste. Set aside.

For Sauce: ==========

Drain ancho chilies, reserving soaking liquid, and place them in
a processor with the olive oil, fresh chilies, and garlic.  Process
until smooth.  With the machine running, add 1/2 cup of walnuts, 1/2
cup reserved pepper soaking liquid and 2 tablespoons of salt.
Process until smooth. Add half of the crumbled cheese and process
until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl.  Coarsely chop the remaining
walnuts and add them to the mixture with the remaining cheese; salt
and pepper to taste.

Shape potato mixture into about 2 dozen 1 1/2-inch balls.
Arrange them on a bed of lettuce leaves, spooning a little sauce on
top. Garnish with eggs, corn, coriander and olives.  Serve at room
temperature.
