Title: Torta Rustica
Categories: Breads, Appetizers
Yield: 1 servings
Water squeezed out
1/4 lb Proscuitto, thinly sliced
1/2 lb Provolone cheese
1 1/2 c  Ricotta cheese
2 tb Chopped fresh herbs
1/4 lg Salami
1    Egg, beaten
Salt & pepper to taste
1 lb Frozen, unbaked bread dough,
Thawed
1 lb Sliced ham
1 lb Mozarella
14 1/2 oz Can roasted red peppers
13 oz Jar marinated artichoke
Hearts, sliced
5    Hard-cooked eggs, peeled
20 oz Pkg frozen spinach, thawed,
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a 4 x 10 inch loaf pan.

On a floured board, roll out the bread dough to a square large enough
to line the pan, with enough excess crust to drape over the edge.

In the bottom of the pan and on top of the dough, place a layer of
half the ham.  Top the ham with a layer of a quarter of the
mozzarella. Lay half the peppers to cover the mozzarella, sprinkle
half the artichokes over the peppers.  In the center, line the eggs
lengthwise down the middle. On both sides of the egg put half the
spinach.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover the egg and spinach
with a layer of all the proscuitto. Spread all the ricotta over the
top of the proscuitto and sprinkle with the herbs. Top with the
sliced salami.

Repeat layers with remaining ham, mozarella, pepper, artichokes and
ending with the mozarella.  Fold the excess dough over the top of the
layers to cover.  Brush with beaten egg.

Bake for 40 minutes until golden brown.  When cooled, cover and place
in refrigerator.

To serve, remove the torta from the refrigerator and let it come to
room temperature.  Unmold and serve in 1" slices.
