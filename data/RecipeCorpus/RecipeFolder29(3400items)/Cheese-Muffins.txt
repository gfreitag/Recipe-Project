1. Preheat oven to 375 F. Thickly grease 9 muffin cups or use paper
liners.

2. Melt the butter and set aside.

salt, and paprika.

4. In another bowl, combine the eggs, milk, melted butter, and thyme;
whisk to blend.

5. Add the milk mixture to the dry ingredients and stir until just

pieces of cheese over each, then top with another spoonful of batter.
For even baking, half-fill any empty muffin cups with water.

before unmolding onto a rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.
