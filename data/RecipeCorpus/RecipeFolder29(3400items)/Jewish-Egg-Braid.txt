This exquisite bread is traditionally made for the Sabbath and
holidays. If there is any left over, it makes delicious toast and
French toast.

1 pkg active dry yeast 3/4 C warm water (105 to 115F) 2 T sugar 1 t
salt 1 egg 1 T oil 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 C flour Oil 1 egg yolk 2 T cold
water Poppy seeds

Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl. Stir in sugar, salt, 1
egg, 1 tablespoon oil and 1 1/4 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir
in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle. Turn dough
onto lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5
minutes. Place in greased bowl. Turn greased side up. Cover and let
rise in warm place until double, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (Dough is ready if
indentation remains when touched.) Punch down dough and divide into 3
equal parts. Roll each part into a rope, 14 inches long. Place ropes
close together on lightly greased baking sheet. Braid ropes gently
and loosely. Do not stretch. Pinch ends to fasten. Tuck under braid
securely. Brush with oil. Let rise until double, 40 to 50 minutes.
Heat oven to 375F. Mix together egg yolk and 2 tablespoons water.
Brush braid with egg-yolk mixture. Sprinkle with poppy seeds. Bake
until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Submitted By BARRY WEINSTEIN
