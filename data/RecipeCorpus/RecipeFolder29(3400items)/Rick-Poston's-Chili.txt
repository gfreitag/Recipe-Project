The ingredient list and instructions are "specific". Rick notes that
you should cook this by the "DUMPS". Makes just over 2 qts.

In a large heavy Dutch oven or kettle, heat the Crisco until sizzling.
Brown the meat cubes, stirring often. Pour off accumulated juices,
and add the first DUMP. Cook the chili covered through all stages and
DUMPS, and stir it frequently. (If additional liquid is needed during
cooking, add more beef broth.)

Cook DUMP 1 for 1 hour. Squeeze the chili pod juices into the pot.
Discard the pods.

Add ingredients in DUMP 2 and cook for 1 hour 25 mins, then add DUMP 3
ingredients.

5 to 10 mins before presentation to judges or guests, add the KICKER
ingredients. Stir well, dish up. Very, very rich.
