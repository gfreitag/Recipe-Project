second time and set aside.
Prepare the muffin tins by placing 1 tablespoon margarine or
:
butter into each cup. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon light brown sugar on top
of margarine. Finally, sprinkle chopped pecans in each cup.
Whisk the wet ingredients in a small bowl.
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir
:
:
just until mixed. (Do Not Overstir)
Spoon the batter into prepared muffin tins. Do not fill the
:
muffin tins as full as you would for regular muffins.
Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 15-20 minutes for
:
regular size muffins or 20-25 minutes for jumbo muffins.
When the muffins are done, immediately turn them upside-down
:
on a baking sheet; DO NOT REMOVE FROM THE MUFFIN TIN!! Allow the
muffins to cool in this position for at least 7 1/2 minutes. Remove
the muffin tin. (You may need the help of a knife to free the pecan
sticky muffins.)
* I personally recommend using the jumbo muffin tins for
:
these.

(Serve these as soon as you can after baking. Tastes best

warm.) Submitted By ELAINE PONCELET   On   04-11-95
