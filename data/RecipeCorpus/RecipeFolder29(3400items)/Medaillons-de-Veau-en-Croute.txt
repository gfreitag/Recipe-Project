For Veal and Sauce: ===================

Cut the loin of veal into 6 slices 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick.
Flatten the slices slightly with a cleaver or knife blade.  Pat the
slices dry and sprinkle with salt and white pepper.  Dredge the
slices in all purpose flour, shaking off any excess to leave a very
light coating. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of butter over
high heat. Add the meat (work in batches if necessary) and saute
until golden, shaking the pan occasionally and turning the slices
once, about 2 minutes. Lower the heat to low, cover the pan and cook
for 2 minutes. Transfer the meat to a platter and pour off all but 1
tablespoon of butter from the skillet. Add shallots, raise the heat,
and stir for 1 minute. Add the wine, scraping up any browned bits in
the pan, and boil until reduced by half.  Add Veal Stock and any
juices from the veal and boil until reduced by about 1/3.  Strain the
sauce and set it aside.  Chill meat, covered.

To Assemble: ============

On a lightly floured work surface, roll out about 1/3 of the puff
pastry into a rectangle, 1/16-inch thick.  Cut 6 pastry ovals roughly
the shape of veal medallions but somewhat larger, to leave a generous
border. Roll out remaining pastry to large rectangle about 1/8 inch
thick. Cut out 6 slightly larger pastry ovals, reserving trimmings
for another use.

Place the thinner set of pastry ovals on a large ungreased baking
sheet.  Brush the pastry lightly with egg yolk mixture, then place
chilled veal medallion in the center of each oval.  Spread a layer of
cooled duxelles stuffing on each, mounding it slightly and dividing
it evenly. Top each medallion with one of the thicker pastry ovals,
smoothing it gently without stretching.  Press edges of the pastry
together firmly to seal. Brush pastry with egg wash.  With a large
round cutter or knife, trim off the edges of the pastry, leaving a
1/2 inch border. Use a small knife to trace a leaf pattern in the top
of each pastry; score a few lines along the sides.  Place the baking
sheet in the refrigerator for 20 minutes or longer.

Preheat the oven to 425 F. Bake veal en croute on the center rack
until golden brown, about 14 minutes.  Meanwhile, reheat sauce,
reducing it further if necessary until it coats a spoon lightly.
Serve veal surrounded with some of the sauce and garnished with
watercress sprigs; serve remaining sauce separately.
