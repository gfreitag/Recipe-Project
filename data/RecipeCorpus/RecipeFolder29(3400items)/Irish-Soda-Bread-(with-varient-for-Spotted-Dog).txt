Title: Irish Soda Bread (with varient for Spotted Dog)
Categories: Breads, Fruit, Irish
Yield: 2 servings
2 ts Sugar
1 ts Salt
2 1/2 c  Buttermilk ***
6 c  All purpose flour
2 ts Baking soda
2 ts Baking powder
3 tb Cornstarch
MMMMM--------------------ADD FOR "SPOTTED DOG-------------------------
1/2 c  Raisins or sultanas
***  may substitute 2 1/2 cup water and 10 tablespoons buttermilk
powder.

Preheat Oven to 375 degrees.

Add all of the dry ingredients in a large bowl and mix very well.  (If
making Spotted Dog varient, then add raisins.) Pour all of the
buttermilk into the bowl at once and stir, using a wooden spoon, just
until a soft dough is formed.  Do not try to make it smooth at this
point.  Pour the contents of the bowl out onto a plastic counter and
knead for a minute or so until everything comes together.  You may
need to add a bit more flour depending on humidity.  The dough should
be smooth, not sticky.

Divide the dough into two portions and shape each into a round loaf,
pressing the top down a bit to just barely flatten it.  Place the
loaves on a large ungreased baking sheet.  Sprinke some additional
flour on the top of each loaf and, using a sharp paring knife, make
the sign of the Cross in slashes on the top of each.

Allow the loaves to rest for 10 minutes and then bake on the middle
rack of the oven for 40 minutes, or until the loaves are golden brown
and done to taste.

Cool on racks.

close Irish friend gives her stamp of approval on this as being an
authentic Irish soda bread.  She supplied the "Spotted Dog" varient.
