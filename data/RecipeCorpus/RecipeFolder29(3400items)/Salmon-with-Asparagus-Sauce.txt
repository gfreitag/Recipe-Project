MMMMM--------------------------ASSEMBLY-------------------------------
2 oz Butter
8 ea Salmon, steaks, 3/4-inch
-- thick, boned
For the Sauce: ==============

Wash the asparagus and snap off the white ends.  Set aside all
tops and half that number of ends.  Plunge the tops into a large pot
of salted, boiling water and cook until limp but not for too long.
(Note: Cook slightly longer than for eating.  If undercooked, they
will not process well; if overcooked, they will taste earthy.)

Drain the asparagus thoroughly and, while still hot, run it
through food processor with unsalted butter for 3 - 4 minutes until
smooth, scraping down the sides of the processor frequently.

Meanwhile, chop asparagus ends to remove the dry hard field cuts
and simmer with cream.  Cook the ends slowly for 20 minutes, then
strain, pressing through gently.  Just before serving, combine
asparagus, butter and cream.  Heat slowly to just below boiling
point. Adjust the seasonings to taste.

To Assemble: ============

Salt and pepper the salmon steaks.  Melt the butter in a heavy
enamel or copper saute pan.  When the butter begins to brown, add
salmon and cook one side for 30 seconds.

Remove the pan from heat, turn the salmon carefully, and let
cook in the hot pan off of the heat for 30 seconds.  Salmon will
still be quite rare.  If you like your fish done more, add to the
cooking time slightly. Don't overcook!  The salmon loses a lot of
flavor when overcooked.

Place the salmon on a towel (cloth or paper) to drain.

Just before you finish cooking the salmon, spoon some of the
sauce onto heated plates; then place the cooked drained salmon on top
of the sauce and serve immediately.
