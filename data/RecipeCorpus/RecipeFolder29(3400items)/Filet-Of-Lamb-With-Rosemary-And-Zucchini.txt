Title: Filet Of Lamb With Rosemary And Zucchini
Categories: Meats, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  White wine
3 tb Cooking oil
1/2 lb Zucchini -- chopped
1 sm Bunch fresh mind
Grapes for garnish
2 lb Boneless lamb filet
3    Cloves Garlic
1 sm Bunch dried rosemary
White peppercorns & Salt to
Taste
Heat skillet over high heat. Sprinkle rosemary, salt and pepper over
lamb filets (there was no mention of the garlic except in the
ingredients list--I would chop it fine and sprinkle it on the lamb
filets also); turn and repeat on other sides. Add cooking oil to
skillet. Brown filets on all sides. When filets are a deep golden
brown place in pre-heated 350 degree oven for 5 mins. to thicken the
juices. Meanwhile, in a saucepan over low heat, add a little cooking
oil. Sprinkle fresh mint into oil. Add chopped zucchini and season
with salt. Stir occasionally until zucchini is cooked. Remove filets
to a serving platter. Sprinkle with white wine. Pour pan juices over
filets. Let set while preparing the individual servings. To serve
place a helping of zucchini in center of plate. Slice a filet into
medallions and place on both sides of the zucchini. Garnish with
grapes. Spoon some of the juices (that collected on the platter) over
the meat. Repeat with other servings.
