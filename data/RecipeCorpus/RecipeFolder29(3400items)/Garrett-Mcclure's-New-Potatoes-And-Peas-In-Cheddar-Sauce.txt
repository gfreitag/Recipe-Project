Categories: Countyfairs, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
1/8 ts Ground Red Hot Pepper
1 ts Salt
1 c  Milk
2 c  Peas, Frozen, Thawed,
-Or Cooked Fresh
4 oz Cheddar Cheese, shredded
2 lb New Potatoes,
-cut in 1" chunks
3 c  Chicken Broth
2 tb Butter
2 tb Flour
2 ts Dry Mustard
1. Bring the potatoes and broth to a boil in a 3-qt saucepan. Cover,
reduce the heat to low, and simmer 15 to 20 mins, until the potatoes
are tender, but still firm. Drain, and reserve 1 cup of broth for the
sauce.

2. Make the sauce, by melting the butter in the same saucepan. Add the
flour, dry mustard, red pepper and salt, and whisk over low heat until
smooth and frothy. Let the mixture bubble for about 3 mins, stirring
often to prevent browning. Gradually whisk in the cup of broth and
the milk. Increase the heat to moderate and whisk the mixture for 2
to 3 mins until the sauce thickens.

3. Add the peas to the sauce and bring to simmer, stirring gently.
Add the potatoes and stir gently to coat. Reduce the heat to
moderate-low. Cover and heat 5 mins, stirring once or twice. Remove
from the heat, and stir in the cheese. Serve at once.
