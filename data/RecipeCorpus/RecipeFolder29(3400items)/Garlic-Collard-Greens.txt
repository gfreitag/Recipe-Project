Categories: Side dish, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Salt
Black pepper to taste
Tabasco sauce
2 lb Trimmed collard greens
- washed, cut into 1" slices
1/4 c  Sliced fresh garlic
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
In a large pot, boil the collards until very very very tender.  Drain
cooked greens thoroughly in a large strainer or colander.

Heat the oil in a skillet or the pot that was used to cook the
collards. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic
is nicely browned and crisped.  Add drained collards, season with
