Title: Vegetable Lasagna #2
Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Thyme
1 ts Basil
3 tb Canola oil
3 sm Onions; -OR-
1 lb Mushrooms
3    Celery stalks
1 1/2 c  Cauliflower
9    Lasagna noodles
-(OR as much as needed)
1 lb Tofu
1/2 c  Tomato paste (or sauce)
1    -to:
2 c  Tomato sauce
-(as much as desired)
1 bn Chard (or spinach)
3 tb Nutritional yeast
Mash up the tofu in a bowl and add salt, nutritional yeast, spices,
tomato paste.  Chop the celery, cauliflower, and onion finely and
saute in oil. When mostly cooked add the mushrooms, sliced.  When the
mushrooms are done, add the vegetables to the tofu and mix well.

Cook the lasagna noodles in water until done.  This can be done
beforehand to save time.  Grease your casserole pan lightly with some
oil to help prevent sticking.  Place a layer of noodles down and
spoon some tomato sauce over it.  Put a layer of tofu/veggies down.

Saute the chard (or spinach) in a pan with just a little bit of oil.
When completely cooked down and soft, add half to the lasagna,
spreading evenly over the layer.  Add more sauce then noodles, then
tofu than another layer of chard.  Top with more sauce, more noodles
and a large amount of sauce (to prevent any burning or drying out of
the noodles when they're cooked). Preheat oven to about 350 or 375
and cook roughly 35 minutes, or until bubbly and hot.  SERVE!  I
guarantee it'll be among the best lasagna you've ever had....
