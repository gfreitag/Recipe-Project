"This pie is my specialty.  It's fairly simple to make but so
dramatic to serve.  The ultimate taste of spring, this luscious pie
has such a big, fresh berry taste I've had many requests to bring it
to gatherings." - Janet Mooberry

In a large mixing bowl, mash enough berries to equal 3 cups. In a
saucepan, combine the sugar and cornstarch.

Stir in the mashed berries and water; mix well.  Bring to a boil over
medium heat, stirring constantly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes.
Remove from the heat; add food coloring if desired. Pour int a large
bowl.

Chill for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until mixture is just
slightly warm. Fold in the remaining berries. Pile into pie shell.
Chill for 2-3 hours. In a small mixing bowl, whip cream until soft
peaks form. Sprinkle pudding mix over cream and whip until stiff.

Pipe around edge of pie or dollop on individual slices.
