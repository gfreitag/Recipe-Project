For meat sauce, heat oil in large saucepan or dutch oven over high

to medium. Stir in onions, garlic and green peppers. Cook 5 minutes
or until vegetables are softened. Add tomato-mushroom sauce, carrot,
sugar, salt and pepper. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer
uncovered for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, prepare
mushroom sauce. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in
onion. Cook 5 minutes or until softened. Add mushrooms, salt and
pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes or until
mushrooms are tender. Disolve potato starch in water; stir in
mushroom mixture. Cook, stirring, until mixture comes to boil and
thickens. Remove from heat. In shallow pan, whisk together eggs and
wine. Dip two matzohs into mixture, soaking about 10 seconds. Place
matzoh side by side in greased 9 by 13 inch baking pan. Pour third of
meat sauce over over top and continue layering, finishing layers with
soaked matzohs. Pour in any remaining egg mixture. Pan will be very
full. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated 375F oven 30
minutes. Spread mushroom sauce over top. Bake 15 minutes, uncovered,
