Catharine Parr Strickland Traill was born in London, England, in
1802. She was the youngest daughter of Thomas Strickland, and of her
eight brothers, and sisters, five also became writers.  Catharine's
first book, "The Blind Piper and Other Tales," was published in 1820.
Several others, most of them for children, were published before she
came to Cananda. In 1932, Catharine married Thomas Traill, an officer
in the Royal Scots Fusiliers, and in the same year they emigrated to
Canada to take up a military grant. They settled in the vicinity of
Peterborough, where Mrs. Traill's brother, Samuel Strickland, had
already established himself, and where her sister, Susanna Moodie,
was also to come.  She lived in the Peterborough-Rice Lake-Lakefield
area until her death at the age of 97 in 1899. Besides coping
successfully with the trials of backwoods existence, Mrs Traill was
the mother of nine children, and ardent botanist, and the author of a
number of books written in Canada.  In addition to the Canadian
Settler's Guide (originally titled The Female Emigrant's Guide) these
were: The Backwoods of Canada, 1836; Canadian Crusoes, 1853; Stories
of the Canadian Forest, 1857; Canadian Wild Flowers, 1868; Stufies if
Plant Life in Canada, 1885 (new edition in 1906); Pearls and Pebbles,
1894; Cot and Cradle Stories, 1895. Origin: Back of The Canadian
