Title: 993998 Chimichangas (Fried  Beef-Filled  Flour  Tortillas
Categories: Tex/mexican, Breads
Yield: 12 servings
1 ts Ground cumin
1/8 ts Pepper
12    (10 inch) flour tortillas
Fat for frying
2 c  Shredded lettuce
2 c  Guacamole
Radish roses
2 lb Beef stew meat
1 1/2 c  Water
2    Cloves garlic, minced
2 tb Chili powder
1 tb Vinegar
2 ts Dried oregano, crushed
1 ts Salt
In medium saucepan combine meat, water, garlic, chili powder, vinegar,
oregano, salt, cumin and pepper.  Bring to boiling.  Cover; reduce
heat and simmer about 2 hours or until meat is very tender. Uncover
and boil rapidly about 15 minutes or until water has almost
evaporated. Watch closely and stir near end of cooking time so meat
doesn't stick. Remove from heat. Using 2 forks, shred meat very fine.
Meanwhile, wrap stack of tortillas in foil; heat in 350 degree oven
for 15 minutes. Spoon about 1/4 cup meat mixture onto each tortilla,
near one edge. Fold edge nearest filling up and over filling just
until mixture is covered. Fold in the two sides envelope fashion,
then roll up. Fasten with wooden pick, if needed. In heavy skillet or
saucepan fry filled tortillas in 1/2 inch hot fat about 1 minute on
each side or until golden brown.  Drain on paper toweling. Keep warm
in 300 degree oven while frying remaining chimichangas. Garnish with
lettuce, Guacamole and radish roses.
