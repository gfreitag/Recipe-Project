Categories: Masterchefs, New york
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM--------------------------CARAMEL-------------------------------
1 ea Bay leaf
3 ea Cloves, whole
1 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Water
MMMMM--------------------------CUSTARD-------------------------------
1 tb Sherry, sweet
4 c  Milk
1 c  Cream, whipping
1 ea Bay leaf
8 ea Egg yolks
2 ea Eggs
1 c  Sugar
1 tb Amaretto OR
For Caramel: ============

Combine the ingredients in a small, heavy saucepan.  Bring the
mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally and
brushing down any sugar crystals from the side of the pan with a
brush dipped in cold water. Continue to cook, without stirring, until
syrup turns a medium amber color.

Immediately strain caramel (reserving the bay leaf) into a 12 x
4 1/2 x 4-inch terrine or 9x5x3-inch loaf pan.  Swirl rapidly to coat
the bottom and sides.  Invert the mold over parchment paper or waxed
paper. Cool.

For Custard: ============

Preheat the oven to 375 F. In a large mixing bowl, whisk
together the egg yolks, eggs, sugar, and amaretto until pale and
light, about 3 minutes. Gently whisk in the milk and cream.  Strain
into the mold and place the mold in a roasting pan.  Put the pan on
the center rack of the oven and place a bay leaf in the center of the
custard.  Add enough hot water to the roasting pan to come 1.3 of the
way up the outside of the mold. Bake until just set, about 1 1/2
hours ( the 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan may take slightly longer.) Remove
from the water bath and cool to room temperature on a rack.
Refrigerate if desired.  Place reserved caramelized bay leaf on top,
slightly overlapping baked leaf.  Serve cold or at room temperature.
