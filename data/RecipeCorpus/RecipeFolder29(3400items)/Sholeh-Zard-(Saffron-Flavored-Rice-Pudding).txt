Categories: Middle east, Desserts, Puddings
Yield: 12 servings
;with mortar/pestle or with
;back of a spoon & dissolved
;in 1 tablespoon of water
1/2 c  Rose water; (bottled)
6 tb Blanched almonds, slivered
4 tb Pistachios, unsalted;
;slivered or finely chopped
1 ts Ground cinnamon
8    Blanched almonds; whole
2 qt Water
1 c  Iranian rice; or other long
;grain white rice, washed
;and soaked
2 c  Sugar
8 tb Butter; 1 quarter pound
;stick, cut into Â« inch
;pieces
1 1/2 ts Saffron threads; pulverized
In a heavy 4 to 5 quart saucepan, bring the water to a boil over
high heat.  Stirring constantly, pour in the rice in a slow thin
stream. Reduce the heat to the lowest possible point and simmer
uncovered for 30 minutes. Stir in the sugar, then add the butter and
the saffron mixture and continue stirring over low heat until the
sugar has dissolved, the butter has melted, and the rice is bright
yellow. Stir in the slivered almonds, and 1 tablespoon of the
pistachios and, stirring frequently, cook for 30 minutes longer, or
until the mixture is thick enough to hold its shape almost solidly in
the spoon.
Stir in the rose water and ladle the mixture into a large heatproof
serving bowl, spread it out evenly with a spatula and sprinkle the
top with two thin crossing lines of cinnamon to divide it into
quarters. Sprinkle each quarter with the remaining 3 tablespoons of
pistachios nuts and decorate with the whole almonds.  Refrigerate for
at least 2 hours, or until the pudding is thoroughly chilled and
firm. Serve directly from the bowl.
