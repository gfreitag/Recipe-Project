Categories: Dress/stuff, Pastry, Masterchefs, New york
Yield: 1 servings
2 1/2 c  Mushrooms, thinly sliced
Pepper, ground (to taste)
2 tb Shallot, chopped
2 tb Parsley, chopped
2 sm Brains, calf, (12 ounces)
1/4 c  Vinegar, wine, white (opt)
1 ea Bay leaf
2 tb Butter, unsalted
For Duxelles Stuffing: ======================

Soak the calf brains in a bowl of cold water with 2 tablespoons
of vinegar about 30 minutes.  Drain and carefully remove as much of
the membrane and veins as possible from the brains.  Set aside.  In a
small saucepan, combine 3 cups of cold water, the remaining 2
tablespoons of vinegar, a little salt and bay leaf.  Bring to a boil,
and simmer for 10 minutes.  Gently add the brains and immediately
remove the pan from the heat.  Let the brains sit in the liquid,
covered, for 8 minutes, then transfer them with a slotted spatula to
a small bowl. Set aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-high
heat. Add mushrooms, sprinkle with salt and black pepper, and stir
until nearly dry, about 8 minutes.  Add the shallot and cook for 2
minutes longer. Add cooked brains, and stir, breaking up the brains,
until mixture is almost pureed.  Add 1/4 cup of reserved Veal Stock
to the mixture and simmer briefly until thick.  Remove from the heat,
stir in parsley and adjust seasoning.  Cool mixture completely, then
chill, covered.
