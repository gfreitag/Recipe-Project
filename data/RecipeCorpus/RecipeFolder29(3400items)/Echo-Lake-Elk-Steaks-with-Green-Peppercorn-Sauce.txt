MMMMM-------------------GREEN PEPPERCORN SAUCE------------------------

4 tb Unsalted Butter
1/4 c  Whole Green Peppercorns
Wash steaks and pat dry.  Carefully trim away all visible fat. Combine
garlic and olive oil.  Pour over steaks and marinate, refrigerated,
for 2 to 4 hours.  Season steaks with salt and freshly ground pepper.
Broil 5 - 7 minutes per side or until meat has only a hint of pink.
Serve with GREEN PEPPERCORN SAUCE.

GREEN PEPPERCORN SAUCE: ~---------------------- In small sauce pan,
melt butter and stir in remaining ingredients. Heat to boiling,
stirring occasionally. Note: ~---- Simple fare with a touch of
elegance. Venison or red stag steaks can be substituted for elk. When
serving Venison or Red Stag Steaks, PORT WINE SAUCE is better than
the green peppercorn sauce.
