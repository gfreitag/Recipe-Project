place overnight. The next day, refrigerate. Stir each day with a
wooden spoon to retard spoilage. On the fifth day, measure out 1 cup

cup white flour, 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup sugar. Stir well. Refrigerate
and stir daily. On the 10th day, measure out 1 cup, if desired, to

plus extra to feed as before and refrigerate. Thereafter, use the
starter almost daily or as desired, feeding every five days.
