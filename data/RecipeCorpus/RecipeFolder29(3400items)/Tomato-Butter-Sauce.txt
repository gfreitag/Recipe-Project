Title: Tomato Butter Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Question?
Yield: 2 cups
1 1/2 ts Coriander seeds
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1/2 lb (2 sticks) cold butter
-cut into tbs pieces
Salt and pepper to taste
2 c  Dry white wine
1 1/4 c  Sherry vinegar
1 c  Plum tomatoes
-coarsely chopped
3 lg Shallots, chopped
1 1/2 ts Black peppercorns
1. In a large nonreactive saucepan, combine the wine, vinegar,
tomatoes, shallots, black peppercorns, and coriander seeds and boil
over high heat until reduced by three-quarters, about 30 minutes. Add
the cream and boil for a few minutes to thicken slightly.

Can be prepared to this point up to 1 day ahead. Let cool, then
strain and refrigerate. Return to a simmer before proceeding.

2. Reduce heat to low and start whisking in the butter, a few pieces
at a time, adding more before the last batch is fully incorporated.
Remove pan from heat the moment all the butter is incorporated;
overheating will cause the sauce to separate.

3. Pass the sauce through a fine strainer into a clean nonreactive
pan. Season with salt and pepper. Keep the sauce in a warm place
until time to serve. Pour over pasta.
