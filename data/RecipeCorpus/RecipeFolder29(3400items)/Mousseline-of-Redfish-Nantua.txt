Title: Mousseline of Redfish Nantua
Categories: Seafood, Masterchefs, New orleans
Yield: 4 servings
Pepper (to taste)
1 ds Nutmeg
1 ds Pepper, red
Sauce Nantua **
1 lb Fish, fresh
1 ea Egg white
1 qt Ice cream
Salt (to taste)
** See Sauce Nantua recipe.

Puree the fish, making sure to scrape down the sides of the food
processor to insure good results.

Add the egg white and blend for 30 seconds, then add half of the
cream and process for another 30 seconds.

Remove this mixture to a mixing bowl over ice and beat in cream
with a wooden spoon until light.

Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and red pepper.  Pour the
prepared mixture into small individual dishes or custard cups.

Place dishes in a pan and add water halfway to the rims.

Cook in a 350 F oven for about 15 minutes or until the
mousseline is firm to the touch.

Unmold and top with Sauce Nantua.

Note: It's difficult to know how much seasoning to put in to
this dish - so I suggest you cook one of the dishes first - taste it
and then adjust the seasonings.
