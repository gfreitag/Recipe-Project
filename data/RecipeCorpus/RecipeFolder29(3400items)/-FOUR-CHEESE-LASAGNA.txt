"Cheese really stars in this lasagna, which I created a few years
ago.  It can be prepared ahead of time and baked later.  I sometimes
make up a couple batches and freeze them in case company drops by." -
Janet Myers

In a skillet, cook beef, onion and garlic until beef is browned and
onion is tender; drain. In a blender, process the tomatoes until
smooth. Stir into beef mixture along with mushrooms, tomato paste and
seasonings; simmer 15 minutes. In a bowl, combine cottage cheese,
Parmesan, cheddar, 1/2 cup mozzarella and eggs.  Spread 2 cups meat
sauce in the bottom of an ungreased 13x9x2" baking dish. Arrange half
the noodles over sauce. Spread cottage cheese mixture over noodles.
Top with remaining noodles and meat sauce. Cover and bake at 350
degrees for 45 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle with remaining mozzarella.
Return to the oven for 15 minutes or until cheese melts.
