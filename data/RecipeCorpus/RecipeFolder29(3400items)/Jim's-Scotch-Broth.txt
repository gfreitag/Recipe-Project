Title: Jim's Scotch Broth
Categories: Soup/stew, Meats, Nuts/grains
Yield: 8 servings
2    Carrots, peeled and diced
2    Ribs celery, diced
1    Onion, diced
Salt & pepper
3 lb Stewing lamb
8 c  Cold water
1/2 c  Pearl barley
2 tb Butter
1/2 c  Turnip, diced
In a large stock pot, cover the lamb with cold water; bring to a
boil. Add the barley, cover the pot, and simmer until the meat and
barley is tender- 1 hour. Remove the meat from the broth. Cut the
meat from the bone, discard the bones and return the meat to the
soup. Continue simmering. In a skillet, melt the butter over medium
heat. Add the carrots, turnip, celery and onion and cook stirring
often for 10 minutes. Add the vegetables to the soup. Simmer until
the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes more. Season with salt
and pepper.

This is getting away from the classic version but-

1/2 c parsnip
Optional:
1/2 c shredded cabbage
sliced leek, white and green sections
1
1/4 t cayenne
1/2 t thyme or sage
1   T Worcestershire sauce
