Melt 1 tablespoon butter in small skillet over moderate heat.  Add
onion, saute until softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Let
cool to room temperature.

In a large bowl, wisk together eggs and mayonnaise.  Stir in
scallions, parsley, lemon juice, Tabasco, mustard, salt, pepper and
1/4 cup cracker crumbs.  Gently stir in sauteed onion and crab,
keeping crab pieces as large as possible.  Season to taste.

Put remaining cracker crumbs in medium bowl.  To make 3-inch ["]
cakes, use 1/3 cup of the mixture for each; for 2-1/2" cakes, use 1/4
cup, and for 1-1/2" cocktail cakes, use a generous 2 tablespoons.
Measure crab mixture and shape into patties.  One at a time, put them
in cracker crumbs, turning once to coat.  Reshape if necessary and
place on platter or waxed paper. If making ahead, cover and chill.

Place large heavy skillet over moderate heat.  Add 1 tablespoon of
remaining butter and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil.  Add half of the crab
cakes and cook until crusty and deep golden brown on one side, 3 to 5
minutes.  (Tiny ones will take only 2 to 3 minutes per side.)  Turn
and brown for 3 to 4 minutes longer.  Drain on paper towels.

Add remaining butter and oil to the pan and cook remaining crab cakes.
Drain briefly.  Sprinkle lightly with chopped parsley before serving.

Makes 8 to 12 (2-1/2 to 3") or 18 (1-1/2") cakes.
