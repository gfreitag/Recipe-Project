reduce to simmer and keep it there during the cooking process.

2. Set top of double boiler over simmering water, and add 4 cups
boiling water. Add salt, then gradually, sprinkle in the cornmeal,
whisking constantly to avoid lump formation.

3. Cover and cook until polenta is very soft and smooth, 1 1/4 to 1

Polenta can be a tedious thing to make properly. The kitchen's of
Cook's magazine researched it's preparation very carefully and came
up with this recipe which is really very simple and yet turns out as
good or perhaps better than any time and effort consuming method.
