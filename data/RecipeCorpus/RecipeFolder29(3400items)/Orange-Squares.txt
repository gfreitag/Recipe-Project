Preheat oven to 350 F.

In a small bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and
nutmeg; set aside.

In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
Beat in the egg and vanilla. Alternately add the flour mixture and
orange juice and zest in three parts, beating well after each
addition. Stir in the coconut and carrots and mix well.

Pour into a greased 8- x 11-inch baking pan and bake for 35 mins.
Meanwhile, prepare the glaze. Using a wire whisk, combine the glaze
ingredients in a bowl. Spread on the orange squares after cooling and
cut into squares. If a thicker glaze is desired, add more
confectioners' sugar by the tsp when whisking.
