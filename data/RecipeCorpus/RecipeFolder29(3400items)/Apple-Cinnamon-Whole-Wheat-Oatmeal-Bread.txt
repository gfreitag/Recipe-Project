Title: Apple-Cinnamon-Whole-Wheat-Oatmeal Bread
Categories: Fatfree, Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1/3 c  Diced apple
1/4 c  Wheat gluten
3 1/4 c  Whole-wheat flour
1/2 c  Oats (I used quick)
3 ts Yeast
1 1/3 c  Apple juice
2 tb Orange juice concentrate
1 tb Honey
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cinnamon
Mix in the order recommended by your breadmaker.  This uses the
powdered-milk white/wheat setting on the Black & Decker. This makes a
good-sized loaf, and it has a lovely aroma. The apple pieces are
indistinguishable at the end (the bread maker must blend them up).
