Title: Roast Chicken Breast
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 servings
No Ingredients Found
Roast chicken breast - I usually sprinkle with a liquid like lemon
juice, then coat with a seasoned breadcrumb blend.  Make a bunch of
this and put it in an old shaker (like a Mrs. Dash shaker or
something) out of breadcrumbs and herbs like sage, parsely flakes,
Basil, onion powder, marjoram, or else the Mrs. Dash, a little salt
and pepper.

Cook it for about 35-40 minutes at 350-400 degrees, perhaps in a
toaster oven.  Serve with rice (to make the rice less boring, add
chicken bullion mix, raisins, herbs, whatever)
