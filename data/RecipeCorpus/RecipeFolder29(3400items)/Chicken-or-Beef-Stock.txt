Note: To make beef broth, use 3 lb of short ribs of beef and 3-4 beef
marrow bones instead of chicken.

Place the chicken pieces in a large 7-9 qt. Dutch oven or stockpot.
Add the water and bring slowly to a boil. Skim the foam off the
surface as it collects. Add the onions, carrots, leek, garlic,
celery, peppercorns and salt. Return to a boil again, then reduce
heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, skimming the surface as necessary.
Tie the bay leaf, parsley, dill and thyme together, add to the pot
along with the parsnips and parsley root. Simmer for 1 hour more.
Strain into a large container, pressing the solids against the
colander to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the chicken
and vegetables. Taste for seasoning, cool and refrigerate or freeze
in 1-qt. containers for future use.
