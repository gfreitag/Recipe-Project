Title: Roasted Rice Powder
Categories: Herbs/spice, Thai, Vietnamese
Yield: 1 /4 cup
1/4 c  Raw glutinous rice
Heat a small, dry skillet over medium-high heat.  Add rice and stir
constantly as rice heats.  After several minutes it will have a
lightly toasted aroma and will begin to turn pale brown. Keep
stirring until all the rice has changed to a light tan color, then
transfer to a spice grinder or mortar & pestle and grind to a fine
powder. Roasted rice powder keeps well in a sealed glass jar for
several months. Use as needed in Thai & Vietnamese dishes.  From
