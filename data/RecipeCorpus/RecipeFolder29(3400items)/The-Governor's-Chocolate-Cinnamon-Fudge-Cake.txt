Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM--------------------------THE CAKE-------------------------------
1 c  Water
1 ts Baking Soda
1 ts Ground Cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Buttermilk
2    Eggs, slightly beaten
2 c  All-Purpose Flour
1 c  Granulated Sugar
1 c  Packed Brown Sugar
8 tb Butter

MMMMM------------------------THE FROSTING-----------------------------
(3 1/2 to 4 cups)
1 ts Vanilla Extract
1 c  Chopped Pecans
6 tb Milk
1/4 c  Cocoa Powder
8 tb Butter
1    Box Confectioner's Sugar
* Preheat oven to 375 F.

1. Whisk the flour and the sugars together in a large bowl. Place the
butter, Crisco, cocoa, and water in a saucepan and bring mixture to a
rapid boil. Pour it over the flour mixture and stir well.

2. Add the baking soda, cinnamon, salt, buttermilk and eggs. Blend
rapidly, and pour into a 9 x 13-inch baking pan. Bake for 30 mins. Do
not overbake; a soft velvety texture is special to this cake.

3. As the cake bakes, make the frosting by placing the milk, cocoa and
butter in a saucepan, heat and blend with a whisk. Off the heat add
the sugar, vanilla and pecans. Spread the hot frosting on the hot
cake.
