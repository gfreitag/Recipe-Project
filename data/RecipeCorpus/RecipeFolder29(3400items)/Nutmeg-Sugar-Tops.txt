Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 3 dozen
1 3/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
3/4 lb (3 sticks) unsalted butter;
-softened
2/3 c  Unsifted confectioners'
-sugar
1 3/4 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1 1/4 c  Unsifted cake flour
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/8 ts Cream of tartar
1/8 ts Salt
MMMMM-------------------TO FINISH THE COOKIES------------------------
Granulated sugar, for
-sprinkling on the cookies
Ice-cold water, for brushing
-the cookies
Sift together the all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder, cream
of tartar, salt and nutmeg.

Cream the butter in the large bowl of an electric mixer on low speed
for 5 minutes.  Add the confectioners' sugar and beat for 1 to 2
minutes on moderate speed.  Blend in the sifted mixture on low speed.
The dough will be quite sticky.

Place the dough on a large sheet of wax paper, place another sheet on
top and roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/3 inch.
Carefully transfer the sheet of dough onto a cookie sheet and
refrigerate until very firm, about 4 hours, or overnight, if you
wish. (The sheet of dough can be stored in the refrigerator, well
wrapped, for up to 2 days.)

Peel off the wax paper just before cutting the dough.  Stamp out 1
1/2 to 1 3/4 inch rounds or squares and place them, 2 inches apart,
on the lined cookie sheets.  Lightly brush the tops of the cookies
with cold water and sprinkle with granulated sugar.  Reroll the
scraps, refrigerate until firm and cut the remaining cookies.

Bake the cookies in a preheated 350-degree oven for 17 to 20 minutes
or until set.  After 1 minute, transfer the cookies to cooling racks
using a wide metal spatula.  Cool completely.

Store in an airtight container, for up to 2 weeks.  The author says
these are "heavenly" served with a baked or poached fruit compote.
