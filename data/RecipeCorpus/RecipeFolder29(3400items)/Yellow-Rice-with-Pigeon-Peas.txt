1 c  Cooked pigeon peas

1 c  Uncooked rice

In a small pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Put the achiote seeds
in for a minutelong enough to release their yellow color and flavor
but not long enough to turn too brown. The oil should be a bright
yellow-orange. Strain the oil into a medium saucepan and discard the
achiote seeds.

Add the onion to the oil and saut until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add the green pepper and garlic, stirring lightly. Add the tomatoes,
capers, cumin, salt, oregano, pigeon peas, cilantro and rice. Stir
over medium heat for 2 minutes, then add the water. Stir frequently
until the water comes to a boil and reduce until it's level with the
rice. Reduce the heat to low and cook for another 20-25 minutes,
until all the water is absorbed.
