1/4 ts Salt
4 c  Flour
1 ts Almond Extract
1 c  Sugar
1 lb Butter (No Substitutes)
-at room temperature
1 lg Egg
*Position 2 racks in the oven. Preheat oven to 350 F.

1. Preferably using standing electric mixer, cream together the sugar
and butter until light and fluffy. At moderate speed, add the egg and
the salt. Add the flour, a little at a time. When it is incorporated,
beat in the almond extract.

2. Do NOT refrigerate; it must be soft. Pack it into a cookie press
and press in rings or designs of your choice onto 2 ungreased cookie
sheets.

3. Place in oven and bake for 5 mins, then switch the positions of the
sheets. Bake for 10 to 20 mins in all, until cookies are golden and
lightly browned on the edges. Cool on racks. Continue baking until
all dough is used.
