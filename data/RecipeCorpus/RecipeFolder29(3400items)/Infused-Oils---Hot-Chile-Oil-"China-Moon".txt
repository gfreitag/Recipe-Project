Title: Infused Oils - Hot Chile Oil "China Moon"
Categories: Condiments, Chilies, Chinese
Yield: 3 cups
4 lg Garlic cloves
- peeled and smashed
2 tb Ginger, fresh minced
2 1/3 c  Oil, Corn or Peanut
1/3 c  Oil, Sesame, Japanese
2/3 c  Chile Flakes, dried red
-shockingly pungent
1/3 c  Beans, Black fermented
- Chinese; coarsely chopped
-(do not rinse them)
Combine all ingredients in a heavy, non aluminum 2 to 2 1/2 quart
saucepan. Rest a deep-fry thermometer on the rim of the pot. Over
moderately low heat, bring the mixture to a bubbly 225 degrees to 250
degrees, stirring occasionally. Let simmer for 15 minutes, checking
to ensure the temperature does not rise. Remove from the heat and let
stand until cool or overnight.

Scrape the oil and solids into an impeccably clean glass or plastic
container. Store at room temperature.

Use the oil wherever you want to light a spark.  The "goop" that
settles to the bottom is a wonderful spicy addition to sauces,
noodles, fillings and marinades.

The day I made my own hot chile oil, I swear I grew a foot as a cook!
Not at all difficult and eminently satisfying, I recommend this
recipe to any aspiring cook. Like grinding and brewing your own
coffee after a lackluster life of instant, the sheer flavor and
freshness of this chile oil will knock your socks off.
