Categories: Fish, Herbs/spice, Main dish, Medieval
Yield: 6 servings
x  Fresh thyme or 2 tsp dried

-scant tsp dried
1 ts (to 2 ts) coarse sea salt

The herbs listed are what might have been used in Anglo-Saxon East
Anglia, but use whatever you might fancy.  Try to use fresh, although
dried is acceptable.

DIRECTIONS:

Put one sprig or generous shake of rosemary down the middle of each
fish. Chop all the other herbs and seasonings and mash them into the
soft butter.  Use this to coat the fish generously on each side.
Griddle, barbeque or grill it for 4-5 minutes on each side or till
the skin is well browned and fle flesh flaking off the bone.  Bast
now and then with the butter which runs off.  Serve at once with lot
of fresh bread and a salad or a simple green vegetable.
