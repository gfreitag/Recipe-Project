Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Plus 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil
1 c  Chopped onion
1 c  Water
1 c  Milk
3/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper

Combine first 3 ingredients; measure out and reserve 1/4 cup flour
mixture. Place remaining 1/2 cup flour mixture in a shallow dish.
Pound steaks to 1/4" thickness; dredge in flour mixture, coating well
on both sides and pressing flour into meat.  Heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a
large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Dredge steaks again in
any remaining flour mixture and fry until browned on both sides,
adding 1 or 2 Tbsp. additional oil to skillet if needed.  Remove
steaks and set aside.

Add onion to skillet, and saute' until lightly browned. Add water,
stirring to loosen clinging particles.  Return steaks to skillet;
cover and simmer 30 minutes, or until tender. Remove steaks,
reserving drippings in skillet. Add reserved 1/4 cup flour mixture to
skillet, stirring until smooth.  Cook until lightly browned, stirring
constantly.  Stir in milk with a wire whisk. Cook, stirring
constantly, until thickened. Return steaks to skillet, turning to
coat with sauce; simmer until hot.
