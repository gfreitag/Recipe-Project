Yield: 8 servings

Salt and pepper to taste
1 1/2 lb Small carrots

1. In a large saucepan of boiling salted water, cook the carrots until
tender, about 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the carrots
to a plate to cool. Add the asparagus tips to the boiling water and
cook until just tender, about 3 minutes. Drain the asparagus and
rinse with very cold water until cool.

refrigerate.

2. Shortly before serving, melt 1 tbs butter in a large skillet. Add
the carrots, cover, and cook over moderate heat until warmed through.
Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a plate and cover to keep
warm. Add the remaining 1 tbs butter to the skillet and reheat the
asparagus similarly. Season with salt and pepper and serve with the
carrots.
