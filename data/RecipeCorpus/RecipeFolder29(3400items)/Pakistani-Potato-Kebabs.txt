Title: Pakistani Potato Kebabs
Categories: Potato
Yield: 20 pieces
-chopped, tightly packed
6 tb Breadcrumbs
2 tb Lime juice
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1/2 c  Clarified butter
-vegetable oil
-or combination
1 1/4 lb Red potatoes (4 med)
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Onion(s), finely chopped
4 1/2 ts Ginger, finely chopped
1    Green chile
-cored, seeded,
-finely chopped
3/4 ts Cumin seeds, toasted
1/3 c  Cilantro leaves and stems
Put potatoes in a saucepan, cover with water, and add the salt. Cover
and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook for another 15 minutes, or
until potatoes are thoroughly cooked and soft enough to mash. Drain
and cool.

In a large mixing bowl, mash the potatoes, leaving them a little
chunky, Add the onion, ginger, chile, cumin seeds, cilantro,
breadcrumbs, lime juice, salt and pepper. Blend thoroughly. Let
mixture stand for 15 minutes, then shape into small patties, about
2-inch in diameter and -inch thick, taking care to smooth out the
edges so the patties don't come apart as they cook.

Heat the butter or oil in a heavy skillet. When it's sizzling hot,
put as many patties in the pan as will fit without touching. Turn
when they're crispy and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Cook the other
side until crispy, and remove from pan with a slotted spatula. Dry on
a cooling rack covered with paper towels. Fry the remaining kebabs.
Serve immediately or put in a low oven to keep warm.
