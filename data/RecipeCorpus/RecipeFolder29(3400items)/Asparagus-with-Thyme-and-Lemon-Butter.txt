Categories: Vegetables, Microwave
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Thyme, fresh, minced
OR
1/2 ts Thyme, dried
1 lb Asparagus
2 ts Unsalted butter
1/4 ts Lemon peel, yellow outer
-skin only
Hold each asparagus spear in both hands and bend until the tough
bottom part breaks off.  Discard the tough parts.  Use a
swivel-bladed vegetable peeler to peel the spears, leaving on a slice
of peel here and there for color.  Arrange the spears on a flat plate
in a star-burst design with the tender tips at the center.  Sprinkle
on about a tablespoon of water, cover with vented plastic wrap and
microwave on full power for 4 to 5 minutes, depending on the
thickness and toughness of the spears. Let stand for about 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the butter, lemon peel and thyme in a small bowl.
Cover with vented plastic wrap and microwave on full power until the
butter is melted, about 40 seconds.  Toss the asparagus with the
butter and serve warm or\very slightly chilled.  Serve as a first
course or side dish with delicately sauced fish or shellfish. Makes 4
servings. Per Serving: 46 Calories, 3 g Protein, 5 g Carbohydrates, 2
