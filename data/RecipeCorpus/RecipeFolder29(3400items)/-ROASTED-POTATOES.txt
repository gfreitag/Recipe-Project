Title:  ROASTED POTATOES
Categories: Potato, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 ts Kosher or sea salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
18 sm Potatoes, quartered
3 tb Olive oil
1 tb Thyme
"These are simple to prepare, and so delicious.  For best results, use
small new potatoes. If you can get them, try Yellow Finns, creamers,
or Yukon Gold potatoes."

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine the potatoes and olive oil in a
roasting pan, turning the potatoes so that they are coated with oil.
Sprinkle on the thyme, salt, and pepper, and roast uncovered for 30
to 45 minutes or until fork tender and nicely browned.  Stir
occasionally during cooking.
