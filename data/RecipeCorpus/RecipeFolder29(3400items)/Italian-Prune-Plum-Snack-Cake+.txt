Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. sift together flour, baking powder,
salt, and sugar. Cut in butter until well blended. Stir in egg and
milk (enough milk so that it is very thick but still batter like.)
Turn mixture into a greased 8 x 8 x 2" pan. Press in prunes, dust

walnut meats. Bake for 30 minutes.

I have frozen the prune plums, whole, in the fall, took out, stoned,
cut in half and made this cake with them. Fresh or frozen plums, it
is one of our family favorites and I believe, my favorite cake!
