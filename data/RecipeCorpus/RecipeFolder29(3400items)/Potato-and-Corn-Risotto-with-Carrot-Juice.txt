1. Heat olive oil in a medium non-stick skillet. Add scallions and

browned, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate;
cover with foil and keep warm.

2. In a medium nonreactive saucepan, combine potatoes, corn, carrot

cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are just tender and
the liquid is reduced by half; about 15 minutes. Raise the heat to
high, add the lemon juice, and bring to a boil. Add the heavy cream
and lower heat to moderate. Stir in the butter, Parmesan, salt, and
white pepper.

3. Ladle potato risotto into warmed shallow bowls or soup plates,
garnish with the fried scallions and chervil and serve at once.
