6 x 1-cm/ 1/2-inch-thick slices venison fillet or haunch Bacon fat or
lard for rubbing Pepper sauce for veal or venison to serve Basting
Sauce: 350 ml/12 fl oz/1 1/2 cups red wine 3 tablespoons oil 1/8
teaspoon ground ginger Salt and black pepper

Venison fillet was the most prized cut.  It might be scored in lozenge
shapes with a knife point or parboiled and larded with salt pork
before being spit-roasted whole.  Modern farmed venison, however,
seems to be tenderised better by being marinated.

Combine all the basting sauce ingredients and soak the venison slices
in the sauce for at least 2-3 hours; elderly meat will need longer.
Pour off the sauce into a jug when you are ready to cook.  Put the
meat on a board and pat it dry, then nick the edges of the slices and
rub them all over with the fat.

Thread the slices on skewers or lay them on a greased grill grid.
Heat the grill to medium-high and grill the meat like steak until
medium-rare or well done, as you wish.  (For well-done meat, reduce
the temperature after searing both sides and cook slowly.)  Baste the
meat with the reserved basting sauce while cooking and turn it once
using a fish slice; do not prod it with a fork.  When done, transfer
the slices to a warmed serving platter, and serve at once, with the
hot Pepper Sauce in a sauce boat.
