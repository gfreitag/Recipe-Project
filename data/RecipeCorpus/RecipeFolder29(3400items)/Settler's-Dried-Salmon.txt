Split the fish down and remove the back-bone; having gutted and
scaled it, wipe it dry, but do not wash it; lay it on a boards, and
strew salt on the inner side; let it lie for two days, turning it
each day; then wash the inside from the salt, string on a willow
wand, and hang up up in the sun and wind to dry for several days;
smoke it, but not to much. The Indians use but little salt in drying
their fish, and smoke them with the wood or bark of red cedar; but
this fragrant wood is not common, and other wood will answer.  Some
merely dry them in the sun, witout smoking. Corn cobs burnt give a
fine flavour either meat or fish, and should be laid aside for such
purposes.  When required for the table, soak for a few hours in warm
water, and boil or fry. Origin: The Canadian Settler's Guide, written
