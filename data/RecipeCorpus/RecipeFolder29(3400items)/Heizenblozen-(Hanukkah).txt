HEIZENBLOZEN
============
2 ea Eggs
pn Salt
1 c  Flour
Mix the eggs, salt, and flour and knead until soft and elastic. Roll
out to a very thin sheet on a floured board. Cut into 2-inch squares
with pastry wheel. Make a slit through the center of each square and
pull one corner through the slit. Drop into hot, deep fat and fry
until a delicate brown, turning if necessary. They fry quickly and
must be watched so they don't become too brown. They'll puff up on
all sorts of odd shapes while frying. Drain on paper towels and while
hot, dust with icing sugar and cinnamon. Makes about 2 dozen. From An
