Title:  FRENCH FRIES
Categories: Potato, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
Kosher or sea salt
Peanut oil for frying
5 lb Potatoes, Kennebecs
-preferably
Scrub the potatoes and cut them lengthwise.  We use a 3/16"-square
cutter, but you can cut them any size you like.  Soak them in water
to remove excess starch, and dry them.

Just before serving, heat the oil to 375 degrees and fry the potatoes
in small batches until golden brown and crispy, about 3 minutes.
Drain them on a cookie sheet and sprinkle with salt.

Thicker fries should be fried twice; fry them first at 325 degrees,
for 5 to 8 minutes, remove them and drain them, and then fry them
again at 375 degrees until the desired color and crispness are
reached.
