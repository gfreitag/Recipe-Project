Title: Anadma Bread
Categories: Breads, Countyfairs
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Salt (Plus 2 Tsp)
3 pk Active Dry Yeast
6    Eggs
10 c  (To 12) All-Purpose Flour
3 c  Yellow Cornmeal
6 c  Water
12 tb Unsalted Butter
-cut in pieces
1 1/2 c  Molasses
1. Stir the cornmeal into the water in a large saucepan and bring to a
boil, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and add butter, molasses
and salt. Let the mixture cool to lukewarm (110 to 155 F). Sprinkle
the yeast over the mixture and let soften for a few mins.

2. Transfer the batter to a large mixing bowl. Stir in eggs.

3. Add 6 cups of flour gradually, stirring to make a stiff dough.
Turn out on a floured board and begin to knead; add more flour as
needed to make the dough manageable. You will add 4 to 6 cups more
flour, depending on humidity. Knead 10 to 12 mins, until the dough is
smooth and elastic.

4. Put the dough in a large greased bowl withplenty of room for the
dough to expand. (Suggest a soup kettle or other large cooking pot).
Cover with oiled plastic wrap or a a lid and let rise until it
doubles, about 1 1/2 hours.

5. Form the dough into loaves and fit into oiled bread pans, to make 4
large or 6 small loaves. (Suggested pans: 4 x 8 x 3-inch or 3 1/2 x 7
1/2 x 2-inch) Cover lightly with kitchen towels and let rise again
until doubled, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 F.

6. Bake the loaves until they begin to brown, about 10 mins. Reduce
heat to 325 and continue baking. Small loaves need about 20
additional mins; large loaves need 30 mins. Remove from pans and cool
on racks.

Notes from Caroline indicate that you can use a standing heavy-duty
mixer with dough hook and knead the amount on 2 or 3 batches. She
says overbaking is the biggest mistake any home baker can make,
because it kills the flavor.
