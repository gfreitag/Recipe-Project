Brioche: ========

In a bowl, mix the flour, sugar, yeast and salt.  Blend well.  Add
eggs and continue mixing until dough is smooth.  Add butter in 4
stages, working each piece into the dough before adding more.
Continue mixing until dough is very elastic and clings to the spoon.
Cover with plastic and chill for six hours.  Unwrap the dough and cut
it in half.  Shape each half into a ball and then work into a loaf
with the palm of the hand. Place each loaf into a clean loaf pan and
let stand in a warm spot. When the dough has become slightly puffy,
deflate with hands. Allow the dough to rise again, to the top of the
pan.  Bake in a preheated 350 F oven for about 45 minutes, until the
dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and is golden brown.  Turn
loaves out of the pans and let them cool on a wire rack. (Only one
loaf is used in this recipe.)

Fruit and Custard: ==================

Mix the eggs, sugar, and flour together until smooth.  Pour in the
cream and blend well.  Peel, core, and slice the apples.  Cut the
crust off of the brioche, slice, then cut into triangles.

Butter a 1-quart souffle dish and line the bottom with one-third
of the brioche slices.  Cover the brioche with apple slices, then
pour one-third of the custard over the apples.  Form a second layer
of brioche slices and cover with a layer of raspberries (sliced
strawberries may be substituted.) Pour another one-third of the
custard over the raspberries. Top with remaining brioche and custard.
Bake at 375 F for 60 - 70 minutes or until the top is golden brown
and the custard is slightly firm. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and
serve when completely cool.
