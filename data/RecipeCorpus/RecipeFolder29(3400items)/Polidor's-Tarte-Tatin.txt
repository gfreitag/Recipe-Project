Pack the apples into the skillet in concentric circles, standing on

bubble in the caramel, 5-8 min. Place the skillet in the oven and
bake for about 25 min, until the apples are tender. Remove the
skillet from the oven and increase the temperature to 425. Roll the
pastry into an 11 inch round. Drape over the apples tucking the edges
between the fruit and the side of the skillet. Make six 1 inch slits
on top and place the skillet on a baking sheet. Bake in the upper
third of the oven for 25 min, until the pastry is golden brown.

invert onto a serving dish. Serve with creme fraiche, cream or ice
