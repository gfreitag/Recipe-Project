"Fresh, colorful and lightly coated with a delectable dressing, this
salad is perfect for a special meal or Sunday dinner.  Mom made it
look so tempting with the crisp radishes and crumbled bacon." ...
Vera Reid; Laramie, Wyoming.

Toss lettuce, radishes and onions in a large salad bowl; set aside.
In a skillet, cook bacon until crisp.  Remove to paper towels to
drain. To the hot drippings, add vinegar, lemon juice, sugar and
pepper; stir well. Immediately pour dressing over salad.   Toss
gently. Crumble the bacon and sprinkle on top.
