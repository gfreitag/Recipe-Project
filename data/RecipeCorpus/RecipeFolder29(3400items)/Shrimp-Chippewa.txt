Title: Shrimp Chippewa
Categories: Seafood, Masterchefs, New orleans
Yield: 4 servings
4 ea Garlic, cloves, chopped
7 c  Stock, chicken
1/4 c  Parsley, chopped
56 md Shrimp, raw, peeled
1 1/2 c  Mushrooms, sliced, fresh
1 1/4 c  Onions, green, chopped
1 1/2 c  Butter
Add the parsley and green onions to the chicken stock.  Set
aside. (This will allow the parsley and green onions to merge with
the stock before further use.)

Saute the shrimp, garlic and mushrooms with a 1/2 cup of butter.

Combine the chicken stock mixture with the shrimp and mushroom
mixture and bring to a boil.

Take the pan off of the fire and add the remaining butter, with
stirring, a little at a time, until all of it has been added and
melted. (The butter will thicken the sauce).

Serve in a soup plate with French bread for dipping.
