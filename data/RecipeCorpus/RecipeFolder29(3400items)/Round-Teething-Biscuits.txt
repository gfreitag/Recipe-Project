Title: Round Teething Biscuits
Categories: Kids
Yield: 3 servings
2 1/2 c  Flour
2    Eggs
1 c  Sugar
Break egg into a bowl and stir until creamy.  Add sugar and continue
to stir.  Gradually add enough flour to make a stiff dough.  Roll out
between 2 sheets of lightly flour waxed paper to about 3/4 inch
thickness. Cut in round shapes.  Place on lightly greased cookie
sheet. Let it stand overnight, 12 hours is best.  Bake at 325 degrees
until browned and hard for approximately 20 to 25 minutes. These
babies work, and the dogs kinda like them too!  Actually you get
about 1 dozen biscuits. Randy Rigg Submitted By RANDY RIGG   On
