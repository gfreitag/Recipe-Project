Title: Mom's Slow Cook Chili
Categories: Chili, Meats, Crockpot, Mom's
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Chili powder
1 lg Can of Hunt's Chili Beans
3 c  Water
1/2 ts Paprika
1 lb Ground chuck
Salt to taste
Onion powder to taste
Garlic powder to taste
3    8 oz cans of tomato sauce
Brown the hamburger in a pan or at the bottom of the pressure cooker.
Add salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder to taste. Add the
tomato sauce, water, chili powder and paprika. Stir well. Mount the
lid on the pressure cooker and bring to full pressure. Let the gauge
rock for 10 minutes slowly. Bring pressure down immediately by
immersing in water or letting water run over the top of the cooker.
Remove lid and add entire can of chili beans. Place on stove at
low-medium heat until mixture heats thoroughly. Makes enough for 4
people with lots of leftovers. (It tastes even better reheated the
next day, we think!) Serve with crackers or biscuits. If you use a
crock-pot instead: Follow basic directions, putting all ingredients
except chili beans together in the pot. Let cook about 7-8 hours. Add
the chili beans in the last 2 hours or so. If you don't have time for
that, you can cook it all in the pot, then transfer it to a stock pot
before adding the chili beans. Heat that on the stove for a few
minutes. From: Pat Stockett Date: Tue, 10-0
