Title:  SCALLOPED POTATOES
Categories: Potato, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
Salt and pepper
1/2 c  Whipping cream
Milk
2 lb Russet potatoes
3 tb Bacon drippings
3 tb Butter
1 tb Flour
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Peel potatoes and cut into very thin
slices. Melt together bacon drippings and butter.  Arrange a single
layer of potatoes in bottom of a greased shallow 1 1/2-quart baking
dish.  Drizzle some of the bacon drippings and butter, and sprinkle
lightly with some of the flour, salt and pepper.  Repeat layers using
remaining ingredients, except cream and milk.  Pour cream over
potatoes; add milk, if necessary, to barely cover potatoes. Cover
loosely with aluminum foil; bake at 350 degrees for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2
hours, or until potatoes are tender.  Uncover, raise oven temperature
to 400 degrees and bake 10 to 15 minutes or until potatoes are
browned on top. Variation:  Scalloped potatoes with ham.  Layer 1/2
cup minced Smithfield or country ham with the potatoes.
