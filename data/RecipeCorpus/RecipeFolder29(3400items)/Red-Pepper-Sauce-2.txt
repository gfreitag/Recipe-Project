Categories: Salsa/sauce, Vegetables, Seafood
Yield: 1 servings
2 ea Large garlic cloves -
-chopped
1 ts Dijon mustard
1/2 ts Fresh lemon juice
1 ea 7-oz. jar roasted bell
-peppers - drained, chopped
1 c  Reduced-calorie mayonnaise
-(I use real mayo)
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
Puree all ingredients in food processor until almost smooth. Season
with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and

This is a great sauce with crab cakes; another suggested use is a
spread for turkey sandwiches. We also use plain old roasted red bell
peppers (homemade or the ones in a jar) on sandwiches; it really adds
a nice flavor.
