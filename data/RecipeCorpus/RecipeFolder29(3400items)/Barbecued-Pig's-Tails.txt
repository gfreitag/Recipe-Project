Categories: Meats

-pepper to taste

We attribute this recipe to the Mennonite colony of Ontario.  It's
often served at picnics and is known as one of the favorite foods at
stag parties.

Prepare pigs' tails according to Step I in basic instructions; cut in
3-inch pieces.  Place pigs' tails on a rack and bake in a 300F oven
for 2 to 3 hours, until meat is tender and most of the fat has baked
off. An alternate method to this is to simmer the pigs' tails in
acidulated water for 1 1/2 hours.

Combine all other ingredients for barbecue sauce, coating tails well.
Grill over hot charcoal, turning and basting, until crisp.  If fresh
rosemary is available, break off several branches, tie them together
and use as a basting brush.  For barbecuing, we prefer leaving the
tails uncut or halved so as to have fewer piece to constantly turn.

Serve with traditional barbecue accompaniments such as corn-on-the-
cob, French bread and green salad.

Serves 6 to 8.
