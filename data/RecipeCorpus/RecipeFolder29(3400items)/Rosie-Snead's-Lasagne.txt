cold water. Set aside.

3. In a large bowl, beat the eggs. Stir in the ricotta, 1/2 cup of
grated cheese, the parsley, salt and pepper. Oil a 13 x 9 -2-inch
baking dish. Spread half the noodles evenly in the dish; follow with
half of the egg-cheese mixture; half of the mozzarella, then half of
the meat sauce. Repeat the layers. Sprinkle remaining grated cheese
over the top.

4. Bake for 35 mins, or until bubbling. Let stand 10 mins to settle.
