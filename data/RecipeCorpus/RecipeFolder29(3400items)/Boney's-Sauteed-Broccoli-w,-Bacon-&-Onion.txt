Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 serving
1 md Yellow onion;
1/2 c  Chicken stock;
1/4 ts Fresh ground black pepper;
1    Bunch broccoli;
1/4 lb Sliced bacon;
1/2 ts Salt;
Wash and dry broccoli.  Cut tops into florets.  Trim stem end (peel
stems, if desired), and cut crosswise diagonally into 1" pieces; set
aside. Halve, peel and mince enough onion to measure 1 cup; set
aside. Coarsely chop bacon.  In medium, heavy-gauge skillet or saute
pan, cook bacon over medium heat, stirring constantly, 2 - 3 minute.
Add minced onion to saute, stirring constantly, 2 - 3 minutes, or
until onion is soft and transparent and bacon is cooked.  Add
broccoli and cook high heat, tossing gently, 1 minute. Stir in
chicken stock, salt and pepper. Partially cover pan, reduce heat to
medium, and cook 3 - 5 medium, or until broccoli is tender. Transfer
broccoli to a heat-proof platter, cover with foil, and keep warm in
200 degree oven until ready to serve. Source: The San Diego
