Title: Hot Fudge Pudding Cake
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 servings
4 tb Butter Or Margarine --
Melted
2 c  Walnuts -- chopped
2 c  Light Brown Sugar
1/2 c  Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
3 1/2 c  Boiling Water
2 c  Flour
4 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
1 c  Milk
In a bowl, sift together the flour, salt, sugar, and the 1/3 cup
cocoa. Stir in the milk, butter, and nuts. The mixture will be quite
thick. Spread it in a 9 x 13-inch baking dish or other shallow
casserole. Sprinkle over it the combined brown sugar and 1/2 cup
cocoa and pour boiling water over all. Bake in a preheated 350 F oven
for 45 mins. Bubbles will appear around the edges. The top will be
firm but will "float". Serve warm.

Author's notes: "This yummy dessert is rich, rich, rich and sweet,
sweet, sweet. Served hot and topped with whipped cream or light
cream, it is hard to beat."
