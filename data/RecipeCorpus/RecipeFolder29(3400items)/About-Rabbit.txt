Title: About Rabbit
Categories: Game, Information
Yield: 1 text file  Rabbit, squirrel, muskrat and ground hog may all be used in any
chicken recipes. Handle rabbit with gloves when cleaning to avoid the
possibility of Tularemia infection. Cook the meat to well-done. The
meat is tenderest if hung 2-4 days or cooked when VERY fresh, before
rigor mortis sets in. Wild rabbit has dark meat; many domestic hares
have all white meat.

To dress: sever the front legs at the first joint and discard. Cut
through the skin around the hind legs across the hip. Peel down the
skin off the legs. Tie the hind feet together and hang over a hook.
The skin will pull down over the upper legs, body and then the
forelegs. Pull it over the head, then sever and discard the head and
skin. Alternatively in the field step on the front paws and tug
upwards on the back leg skin and then stand on the hind paws and pull
upwards to peel the skin over the head.

Gut and clean, retaining the heart and liver. Wash the carcass in
acidified water ie water with a dash of vinegar. Rinse, pat dry with
paper towels and sprinkle lightly with pepper.

To cut into serving pieces: Rabbit is carved differently than
chicken. The best way is to sever the four legs and cut the back into
three sections for a total of seven portions.
