To three gallons of pickle, strong enough to float an egg, add 1/4
pound of alum, 1 quart of treacle, 1 oz of potash, mix them well
together; pack the beef or pork, and pour the pickle on it; cover it
close; in about three weeks it will be fir for use.  The meat must
not be salted, but packed as it comes from the butcher, and the
pickle poured over it. Origin: The Canadian Settler's Guide, written
