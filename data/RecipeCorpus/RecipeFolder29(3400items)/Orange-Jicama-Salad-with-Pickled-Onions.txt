Categories: Side dish, Vegetables, Low cal/fat
Yield: 8 cups
1 ts Citrus zest
1 pn Red hot chili flakes
1 c  (prox.) Freshly chopped
. cilantro
1 c  Pickled red onions (see
. next recipe)
4 ea Navel oranges PLUS
1 ea For juice or other citrus
. fruit
1 lb (or more) Jicama root
1/2 c  Mixed citrus juice (see note
. above)
Jicama, a large, spherical root vegetable with a pale, brown papery
skin, is a leguminous tuber.  Its white flesh, which doesn't
discolor, is delightfully crisp and juicy, like a water chestnut.

First grate some of the orange peel, if using, then cut off all the
peels, slicing beneath the white pith of the orange.  Slice the
orange into rounds or segments and set on a platter.

Peel the jicama and cut it into cubes or strips,, and add to the
platter with the oranges.

Make a mixture of citrus juice or use only orange juice with a
squeeze of lemon juice to taste.  The juice should be tart enough to
be lively. Mix with the zest, chili flakes, and cilantro, then pour
over the fruit and jicama.  Scatter the pickled onions over all, toss
lightly and carefully with your hands, and serve.

Variations:  Include sliced radishes and add them just before
serving. Use fresh green chilies, minced or sliced in rounds and
scattered over the top. Grate some ginger and mix it with the citrus
for an entirely different flavor.  If you don't like cilantro, try
using parsley or a mixture of parsley and dill.  Pomegranate seeds
scattered over the top would make a beautiful, jewel-like garnish.
