1 lg Cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tb Olive oil
1 tb Fresh lime juice
2 lb Roasting chicken, skinned
-and trimmed of fat
1/2 ts Ground cumin
Salt & fresh pepper to taste
MMMMM------------------------GUAVA GLAZE-----------------------------
3/4 ts Red wine vinegar
1/2 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1/2 c  Diced fresh papaya
3/8 c  Guava jelly
3/8 c  Bottled guava nectar/juice
1/8 c  Fresh lime juice
1 1/2 tb Jalapeno jelly
3/4 ts Worcestershire sauce
To marinate and roast chicken:  Season chicken inside and out with
cumin, salt and pepper.  Mix together the garlic and oil and rub over
the chicken.  Tie the legs together and tuck the wing tips under the
back. Set the chicken in a shallow glass dish and sprinkle with lime
juice. Cover and marinate for 2 to 3 hours in the refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil,
set chicken in the pan, cover loosely with aluminum foil and roast
for 45 minutes.
To make gauva glaze:  Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine guava
jelly, guava nectar or juice, lime juice, jalapeno jelly,
worcestershire, vinegar, paprika and cumin.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce
heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until the sauce has thickened
and reduced to one cup, ten to fifteen minutes.  Remove from the heat.
To glaze chicken:  Once the chicken has roasted for 45 minutes,
brush it with hot glaze and return to the oven.  Roast uncovered,
brushing with glaze every ten minutes, for 20 to 30 minutes longer,
or until the juices run clear when the thigh is pierced with a fork
and a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 180 degrees.
Transfer the chicken to a warmed platter and brush with glaze one
last time. Bring the remaining glaze to a simmer.  Remove from the
heat and stir in papaya. Serve the chicken with the glaze alongside.
