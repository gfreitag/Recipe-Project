KOSHER DOESN'T MEAN SWEET
The term "kosher wines" used to be an oxymoron. They were sweet and
syrupy, and tasted like alcoholic grape juice. These wines still
exist as Manischewitz (18 on the (*) LCBO's sugar scale) and Mogen
David ( a mere 15). In comparison, the sweetest port is 11 on the
scale. There is no Talmudic injunction that says kosher wine has to
be sweet. Today, the top producers in Israel, California and Europe
are using the noble grapes (Chardonnay, Cabernet, Sauvignon and the
like) to produce fine dry wines that are also kosher. To be kosher, a
wine must be under rabbinic supervision. Currently at Vintages there
are several kosher wines worthy of the Passover table.

HAGAFEN WHITE TABLE WINE 1993: (Can.$13.80) From Napa is "MEVUSHAL" -
that is 100 per cent kosher. It has a soft peach-floral flavor with a
hint of residual sweetness.

HERZOG JOHANNISBERG LATE HARVEST RIESLING 1991: A medium-sweet dessert
wine from California (Can.$9.70 half-bottle) is kosher but not
MEVUSHAL.

YARDEN FROM ISRAEL: Yarden of Israel offers two white varietals.

CHARDONNAY 1993: (Can.$14.95) Chardonnay has a spicy-apple-lemon taste
with a toasty finish.

SAUVIGNON BLANC 1993: (Can.$13.75) The Sauvignon Blanc is elegant with
grassy, green bean and green pepper flavors, very true to the grape.

YARDEN: CABERNET SAUVIGNON 1991 (Can.$16.95) In red, Yarden does a
Cabernet Sauvignon which has a herbaceous blackcurrent and bell pepper
flavor, very much in the California style.

On general listing, the Carmel wines from Israel are MENVUSHAL. In
whites, there's FRENCH COLOMBARD and SAUVIGNON BLANC (Can.$7.05 for
each) and the sweet CHATEAU RICHON (Can.$6.95). There is CARMEL
GRENACHE ROSE (Can.$7.10). In red, CARMEL CABERNET SAUVIGNON
(Can.$7.05) is dry, but CARMEL CONCORD and SACRAMENTAL are 23 and 18
respectively on the sweetness scale. From Article: Kosher Doesn't
