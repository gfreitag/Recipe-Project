Title: Acharuli Khachapuri (Adjarian Cheese Bread)
Categories: Breads, Russian
Yield: 1 servings
4    Eggs
4 ts Butter
1    Recipe Deda's Puri
1/2 lb Eng. Lancashire Or Med-Sharp
White Cheddar -- grated
Preheat oven to 425 F. Prepare the dough and divide into 4 equal
parts. Form each into an oval and pat down with floured hands until
1/2-inch thick. Depress the center of each to about 1/6 inch
thickness and to within 1/2 inch of edge. Place the dough on an
ungreased or nonstick baking sheet. Bake for 15 mins, then remove
from the oven. Fill the bottom of each bread with cheese, then break
an egg on top. Return to the oven, reduce temperature to 375 F, and
continue baking for 8 to 10 mins. The khachapuri will be done when
the egg white is set, and the yolk is soft, and the bread is golden
color. Remove from oven and serve with a pat of butter on top of each
yolk. (Author's Note): you mash the butter, egg, and cheese together
with a fork and push them inside the thick outer edge of the bread.
It is then cut with a knife and fork and eaten.
