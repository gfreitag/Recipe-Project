Title: Yeast Starter Mix
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings

In a quart jar, mix 1\4 C. sweet milk and 1\4 C. cold water, add 1\2
C. sugar and 1\2 C. flour.  Put in warm place and stir once in
awhile. In two days add 1 T. flour.  Let stand nine days.  Before
using to bake the next day, add a little cold water and stir well. At
bedtime, pour into a crock or pan.  Use only a quart of water the
first time. Mix to make a batter, cover and let stand until morning.
Take out 3 or 4 tablespoons, place in a jar and add about 1 C. sugar,
more if you want sweeter bread. Set this away for the next time,
keeping in a cool place. To the rest of the sponge, add salt.  Be
sure you take the starter out before adding the salt! Now proceed as
with any bread.  If this is used at least twice a week, to keep the
starter fresh and alive, this works fine.
