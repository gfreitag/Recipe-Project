Dissolve yeast in water.  Add milk, sugar, salt, eggs, butter and 3
1/2 cups flour; mix well. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a
soft dough. On a floured board, knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8
minutes. Place in greased bowl; turn once to grease top.  Cover and
let rise until almost doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Punch down.  Cover
and let rise until almost doubled, about 30 minutes. Divide into 6
portions.  On a floured board, shape each into a 14" long rope.  For
each loaf, braid 3 ropes together on a greased baking sheet; pinch
ends to seal. Cover and let rise until doubled, 50 60 minutes. Beat
egg yolk and water; brush over loaves. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Bake at 375 degrees for 30-35 minutes.
