Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM-----------------------SOURCE: TASTE----------------------------
170 g  Feta cheese, crumbled
2    Eggs, beaten
Sea salt and freshly ground
-black pepper
1 lg Savoy cabbage
2 tb Olive oil
2 cl Garlic, crushed
7 1/2 g  Broken walnuts
Take off the outside leaves of the cabbage (cut out and throw away the
thick spines) and blanch.  Slice the rest of the cabbage and stir fry
in the olive oil and garlic for a moment, so that it is reduced in
bulk but still crunchy.  Throw it into a bowl and add the walnuts,
feta cheese and beaten eggs, mix thoroughly and add seasoning.
Butter a souffle dish, line the bottom and sides with the cabbage
leaves and spoon in the walnut mixture.  Cover with greaseproof
paper, place in a preheated oven 220C for 1/2 hour or until it has
risen.  Take out and leave to settle for 5-10 mins, then unmould
while it is still warm and serve at once with porcini sauce (See
Recipe for Porcini Sauce).
