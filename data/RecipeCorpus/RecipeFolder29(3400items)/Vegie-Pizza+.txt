Mozerella, grated

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread rolls flat in jelly roll pan
and form outer ridges. press and pinch dough so there are no holes or
gaps, just one solid sheet. Bake 10 minutes till light golden brown.
Cool completely. mix cream cheese, mayo and spices together well and
spread evenly over crust.

Sprinkle your choice of chopped vegies (about 1/4" chop) over the
cream cheese mixture. Top with cheese. I have found this a case of
"less is more". The pizza is very hard to handle when eating if there
is too much "stuff" on top of it.

You could leave this in the refrigerator overnight if you wish. Just
cover with plastic wrap.

Cut in squares to serve.
