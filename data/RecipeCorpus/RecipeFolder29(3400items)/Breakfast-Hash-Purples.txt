Soak the purple potatoes in a bowl of water for about a half an hour.
This makes it very easy to scrub the skins, eliminating the need to
peel them and lose those  nutrients.  After scrubbing, pat them dry
and cut them into approximately 3/4" cubes. Be careful where you cut
them, as they can stain (purple potato juice!). Put them in a mixing
bowl. Wash, trim, and slice the green onions. Add to potatoes. Finely
chop the garlic and add to potatoes. Wash and cut up the red peppers
to taste. I like fairly large hunks of sweet red pepper. Add salt,
pepper, and pepper powder to taste.

Spray a little bit of pam or other cooking spray in a non-stick
roasting pan. Bake in a 400-degree oven for approximately 1/2 hour.
This time will vary with the size and amount of the potato pieces.
Stir occasionally while baking. I have found that ensuring that they
lie in a single layer works the best and yields a crispy, not soggy,
crust on the potatoes.

Sorry about the approximate amounts.  I make this different every
time.  We find that the combination of purple, green, red, and white
makes a dish that is a visual delight.  It's also a low fat
replacement for those greasy breakfast hash browns.
