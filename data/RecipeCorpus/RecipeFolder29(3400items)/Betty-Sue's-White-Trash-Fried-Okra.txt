Title: Betty Sue's White Trash Fried Okra
Categories: Vegetables, Whitetrash
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 c  Corn meal or cracker meal
Salt and pepper
1 lb Fresh okra, cut into rounds
OR
2 pk Frozen, cut into rounds
Season okra with salt and pepper, then coat with the corn meal (shake
in a bag) until okra is coated. Fry okra in a hot skillet with a
little oil and fry until golden brown, about 12-15 minutes. Allow to
drain on paper towel to absorb excess grease.  Serve hot.  Serves 4.
Mrs Swilley says, "Ssteer clear of al those fancy frozen packages of
this-in-a-sack or that-in-a-sack.  Loose frozen vegetables are just
as good, but make sure you season them like you like them." Origin:
