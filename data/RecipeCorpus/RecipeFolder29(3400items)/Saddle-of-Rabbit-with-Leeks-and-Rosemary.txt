** The "saddle of a rabbit" is the rabbit's back from the first
rib to the beginning of the legs.

Marinade: =========

Put the saddle of the rabbit in a small bowl with 1 cup of white
wine and 1 sprig of rosemary.  Chop the carrot, onion, celery, and
garlic add them to the marinade.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap
and store in the refrigerator for 24 - 48 hours.  (The longer the
better for the flavor of the rabbit meat.)

Rabbit: =======

Preheat your oven to 450 F.

Remove the rabbit from the marinade and dry with a cloth.  Salt
and pepper the rabbit.

In a medium roasting pan, add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1
tablespoon of olive oil.  Heat the mixture until the butter sizzles.

Place the rabbit in the pan, skin side up, and brown.  Turn,
wrapping flaps around the filet to protect it, and cook until light
brown. Place the pan in the 450 F oven and cook for 10 minutes, until
medium rare. Baste often.

Add the vegetables from the marinade to the pan with the rabbit
and cook for another 5 minutes, basting and turning occasionally.

Remove the rabbit from the pan and place it aside in a warm
location. Trim the saddle flaps from the rabbit and chop the flaps
coarsely.

Sauce: ======

Return the chopped flaps to the pan with the vegetables.  On the
stove top, saute briefly and skim the fat.

Deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup of wine, add the rabbit stock and
reduce by one-half.

Add the tomato and saute while stirring.  Strain the hot mixture
through a sieve, reserving the liquid (for sauce) and discarding the
vegetables. Add the butter to the liquid and whisk until smooth.

Leeks: ======

Julienne the leeks.  Rinse in cold water and drain well.

In a medium saute pan, add 1 tablespoon butter and leeks.  Cook
slowly for 2 - 5 minutes.  Leeks should remain crisp.  Adjust the
seasonings and set the leeks aside in a warm place.

Assembly: =========

Remove the filet of rabbit from the saddle.  Cut the saddle bone
crosswise and place one section on each of two plates.  Surround the
saddle bones with leeks.

Cut the filet of rabbit into very thin slices lengthwise.  Fan
slices on top of the leeks.

Cover with sauce, garnish with sprigs of rosemary.  Serve
immediately.
