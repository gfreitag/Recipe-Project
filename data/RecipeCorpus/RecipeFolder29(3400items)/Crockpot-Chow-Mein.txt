Title: Crockpot Chow Mein
Categories: Poultry, Crockpot
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Teriyaki sauce
Parsley
3 ds Tabasco
2    Handfuls of bean sprouts
6    Chicken thighs; skinned
6 oz Mushrooms; sliced
1    Onion; sliced
3    Garlic clove; minced
Put everything except the bean sprouts in a crock pot in the morning.
Mix them up and set to low.  Should be mostly done when you get back
home. Prepare some rice to spoon over.  After you start the rice put
bean sprouts in the crock pot and mix up.  When the rice is done, the
chow mein is done. Serve over the rice.  Note that the chicken is so
tender that it will literally fall off the bone.  What I like to do
is de-bone all my pieces and mix everything (chow mein, rice) up
together.
