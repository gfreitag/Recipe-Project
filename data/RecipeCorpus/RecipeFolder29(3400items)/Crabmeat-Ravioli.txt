Sauce Bechamel: ===============

Melt the butter and add flour, salt and pepper.  Cook for 2 or 3
minutes, whisking all of the time.

Add cream gradually, whisking to avoid lumps until the sauce
thickens. Let simmer until reduced to 1 cup.  Set aside to cool.

Crabmeat Filling: =================

Add the crabmeat to the sauce bechamel.

Melt the butter in a pan and saute the onions until they are
clear but not browned.

Add onions and crumbs to the cream sauce, mix, then cool.

Form into balls the size of large marbles.

Ravioli Dough: ==============

Put the flour into a bowl and add remaining ingredients.  Work
with your hands or a wooden spoon until a dough forms and can be made
into a ball.  Knead for 5 or 6 minutes and set in a bowl to rest.

After an hour, put the dough on a floured board and roll paper
thin.

Assembly: =========

Place the crabmeat balls about 1 1/2 inches apart on a sheet of
the pasta dough.  Paint the area between the balls with water and top
with a second sheet of dough.

Form the ravioli by pressing around each ball to form a seal.
Dust with flour and cut into squares.

Boil for 5 minutes in rapidly boiling salted water.

Serve with the following sauce.

Sauce: ======

Reduce the cream by one-third and season with salt and pepper.

Whisk in the butter and serve over ravioli.  Top with the grated
Parmesan cheese.
