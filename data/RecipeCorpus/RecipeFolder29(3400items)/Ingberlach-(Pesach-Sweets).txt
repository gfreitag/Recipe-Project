Title: Ingberlach (Pesach Sweets)
Categories: Desserts, Jewish, Passover
Yield: 1 servings
x  Sugar
1 c  Walnuts (150g/6oz); coarsely
Chopped
1 tb Ginger (scant)
INGBERLACH (PESACH SWEETS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2 lb Carrots (1kg); scraped and
Washed
x  Water OR Orange Juice
Cover the cleaned carrots with water or orange juice, bring to the
boil and simmer until they are soft but not mushy. Drain and allow to
cool. Grate the cooked carrots on a fine grater. Squeeze out
superfluous moisture and measure the pulp. Allow 1 cup/250g/8oz sugar
to every 1 cup/250g/8oz carrot pulp. Return the pulp to a clean heavy
bottomed pot (a preserving pan is best), add the warmed sugar and
bring to the boil. Stir all the time to prevent scorching. When the
mixture comes away fro the pan sides and shows signs of whitening in
places, stir in the ginger and the nuts. Take off the heat and spread
evenly on a wetted board or marble slab. Allow to cool and dry. Cut
into neat diamond shapes, turn over and allow to dry on the other
side. Store in an airtight tin. Separate each layer of INGBERLACH
with wax paper and dusted with sugar.
