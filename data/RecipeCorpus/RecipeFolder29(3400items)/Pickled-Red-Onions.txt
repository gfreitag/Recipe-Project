. 1/4 tsp Red Peppercorns
1 ts Sugar
1 ea Garlic clove, sliced (opt.)

Peel the onion and slice into thin rounds.  Separate the rounds and
put them in a colander large enough to hold them comfortably.  Place
the colander in the sink.

Bring about a quart of water to a boil and pour it over the onions,
letting it drip right through the colander.  Transfer the onions to a
bowl and add the vinegar, cold water, spices, sugar, and garlic, if
using. If the onions aren't covered by the liquid, add more as
necessary, using equal parts water and vinegar.  Cover with plastic
wrap and refrigerate until cool and the color is diffused, about 30
minutes. Keep in the liquid, refrigerated, and use as needed.
