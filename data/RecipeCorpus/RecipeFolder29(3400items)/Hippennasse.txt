Prepare the basket molds by greasing the bottoms of teacups.

Bake cookies 2 - 3 minutes in a 375 F oven.  While still soft,
mold into desired basket shapes, then continue baking until light
brown and completely dry.

Cool and store in an air-tight container until used.

To serve, fill cookie baskets with fresh fruit such as
raspberries. Garnish with strawberry or apricot puree and fresh mint
leaves.
