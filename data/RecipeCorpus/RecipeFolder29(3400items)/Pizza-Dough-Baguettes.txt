2 ts All-purpose flour, divided

- Crust
Light vegetable oil cooking
I use pizza dough to make great, hearty baguettes for my bruschetta
and grilled vegetable sandwiches.  To yield two 9-inch baguettes,
follow the recipe for pizza dough up to the point at which the dough
has risen for an hour, to double its original size.

Transfer the dough to a work surface taht has been dusted with
cornmeal. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, until elastic,
repeatedly pushing it away from you with the palm of your hand, then
folding it over toward you, and pushing it away again in a wavelike
motion.

Cut the dough in half.  With the palm of your hands, roll each piece
into a narrow rope 9 inches long.  Spray a cookie sheet 3 times with
light vegetable oil cooking spray and place the dough on the sheet.
Cover with a towel and put the cookie sheet in a warm spot until the
halves of dough double in size, 30 to 40 minutes.

Toward the end of this second rise, preheat the oven to 375o.

With a razor blade, make 3 diagonal slashes on the top of each
baguette. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of all-purpose flour over each.  Bake
for about 25 minutes, until the baguettes are brown and sound hollow
when tapped.

Transfer the baguettes to a wire rack to cool.
