Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM----------------VEGETARIAN GOURMET;SUMMER 92---------------------
1/2 ts Parsley
1/2 ts Sage, rubbed
1/2 ts Thyme leaves
6    Squash, yellow
3/4 c  Cheese, ricotta
4    Onions, green; chopped
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Remove and discard stem ends of the
squash. Slice the squash lengthwise, scoop out seeds and place the
halves side-by-side on a baking sheet. Combine remaining ingredients
in a mixing bowl. Fill the hollows in the squash evenly with the
cheese mixture. Bake 15-20 minutes or until squash is tender. Serve
immediately.

Sylvia's comments: This is a recipe with infinite possibilities!  I
used large summer squash and saved the removed seeds, then added just
garlic salt, since I wanted to taste it "as is" before I made a lot of
modifications.  But it should take almost anything!  I'm planning to
add different cheeses, chopped olives, and every spice in my spice
cabinet. If you really couldn't handle a meatless main dish, sausage,
bacon, or any cooked diced meat should work great.
