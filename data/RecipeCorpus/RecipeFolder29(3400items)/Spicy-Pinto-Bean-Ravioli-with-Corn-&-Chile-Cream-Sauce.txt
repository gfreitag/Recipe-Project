1 ts Salt
Soak the beans overnight in water to cover.  In the morning rinse the
beans with cold water ande place them in a saucepan with enough fresh
water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat and
simmer several hours, until the beans become soft and begin to split.
Add water when necessary and stir occasionally to prevent the beans
from burning. Remove from heat.

To perpare the bean puree, toast the oregano and cumin in a dry saute
pan over medium heat until lightly browned.  Remove from the pan and
set aside. Add the unpeeled garlic to the pan and roast over medium
heat until it is soft and blackened in spots.  Let cool, then peel
and mash with a knife.

In a saucepan, saute the onion in 1 tablespoon of the oil over
moderate heat until it is lightly browned.  Reduce the ehat to low,
add the garlic, and cook 1 minute.  Add the oregano, cumin, chile
powder, salt, beans and just enough water to cover, 2 to 3 cups.
Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce heat and simmer uncovoered
30 minutes.

Puree the bean mixture in a food processor until smooth.

In a cast iron skillet, heat the remaining oil over high heat to its
smoking point.  Add the bean puree and stir 1 minute.  Reduce the
heat to moderate and cook 5 minutes, while stirring, until the bean
puree is a medium paste.  It will thicken as it cools.

Next prepare the ravioli dough following the directions given. Divide
the dough in half and roll out each portion of the dough 1/8 inch
thick into a rectangle 12-X-15 inches.  With the back of a knife,
lightly mark 3-inch squares into the doug.  With a basting brush,
spread a thin layer of egg wash about 1-inch wide along the marked
lines on the dough. Place 1 tablespoon bean filling in the center of
each square with a spoon.

Roll out the remaining dough to the same size as the bottome layer and
place on top.  With your fingers, press down around each mound of
filling to release the air and seal each piece of ravioli.  Cut
between the mounds with a pasta crimper and sealer, making sure the
top and bottom layer of the pasta dough are sealed securely.  Set the
ravioli aside while you make the sauce.

To make the cream sauce, roast the anaheim chiles, then peel, seed,
devein, and dice them.  Combine 3 cups of the corn, 2/3  of the diced
anaheim chiles, the serrano chiles, salt, and pepper in a food
processor and process about 2 mintues, until smooth.  Scrape the
sides and process another 30 seconds.  Push through a fine sieve and
discard the skins.

Put the mixture in a saucepan and heat over moderate heat 3 minutes,
slowly adding the cream while stirring.  Add the reamaining corn
kernels and diced anaheim chiles.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer
5 minutes until the corn is tender.  Set aside to keep warm.

Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.  Place the ravioli
in the water and cook 3 to 5 minutes, until tender.

Drain the ravioli and serve immediately with the cream sauce.  Allow
2 to 3 ravioli per person.  Garnish with red and green chiles.
