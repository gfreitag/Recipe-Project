Chef Willy Coln is fascinating to watch as he darts about his
shiny kitchen.  No steps are wasted as he assembles what he needs for
a particular dish.  When he sets to the task, he is a blur of
activity. When he comes into focus, the dish is completed.

One reason for this efficiency is the design of the kitchen,
which Chef Coln had specially built.  Another is his experience in
running kitchens, first in his native Germany, then through Europe
and the Caribbean, and finally in the United States.  Coln has
trained cooks of many nationalities, and he has learned from them as
well.

This give-and-take in matters culinary has put a special brand on
Coln's style.  His dishes are solidly based on a classic foundation,
yet their superstructure is a delightful blend of imagination and
creativity. Although the ingredients may reflect a mixed heritage,
the whole is always a unique combination that surprises and delights
the palate.

Note how the menu proceeds with the amalgamation of styles, yet
ends with a perfectly orchestrated feeling.  From spicy to rich to
soothing, this menu is a mark of Chef Willy Coln's expertise and his
sensitivity to the nuances of the total dining experience.
