plain. ~

~ For increased flavor and moistness, add gravies and sauces to your
foods. ~- Mix butter or margarine into soups, vegetables, mashed
potatoes, cooked cereal, rice and other hot foods. Serve breads hot
(more butter can be used as it melts into the bread). ~

~ Use mayonnaise in salads, deviled eggs and sandwiches. ~

~ Sour cream or yogurt can be used on vegetables such as potatoes,
beans, carrots and squash. Sour cream or yogurt can be used in
gravies or casseroles, as a salad dressing or a dip. For a tasty
dessert, scoop sour cream or yogurt on fresh fruit, add brown sugar
and let it sit in the refrigerator for a while. ~

~ Spread honey, cinnamon and sugar or jelly on bread, rolls or
crackers. Honey or sugar may be used in hot drinks or on cereal. ~

~ Cream cheese can be spread on bread, rolls or crackers, added to
casseroles or as a topping on cakes and cookies. ~

~ Add raisins, dates or chopped nuts and brown sugar to hot or cold
cereals, meats, sauces, vegetables, salads, desserts and baked
products.

~ Add marshmallows to fruit, hot chocolate, desserts, sweet potatoes
or glazed carrots. ~

~ Add whipping cream to pies, fruit, puddings, hot chocolate, gelatin
and other desserts. ~

~ Have snacks ready to eat. Nuts, dried fruit, candy, buttered
popcorn, crackers and cheese, granola, ice cream and popsicles all
make good snacks. Milkshakes add calories and protein and are easy to
prepare.
