brandy to taste Worchestershire sauce to taste

Have your fish dealer prepare the squid (skin, remove the long bone
on the inside, the yellow deposit, and the ink sac). Wash the squid
well, dry thoroughly, and cut crosswise into 1/4" slices resembling
rings. Poach in white wine to cover just until tender. Drain. Cool to
room temperature. Thoroughly wash and scrub the mussels, removing
grit and sand. Place the mussels in a large pot. Pour in 1/2 cup
boiling water, cover and steam over medium heat  for 5 minutes or
until the shells open. They should be cooked and served the same day
you buy them. Arrange an assortment of the seafood attractively on 8
plates. Garnish with lemon wedges. Whisk together the oil and lemon
juice, and drizzle the mixture over the seafood. Using a whisk,
combine the mayonnaise, catsup, brandy, and Worchestershire sauce.
Serve a dollop of this sauce on each plate. Makes 8 servings.
