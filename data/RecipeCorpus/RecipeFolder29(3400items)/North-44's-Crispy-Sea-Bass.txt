A favorite of Tom Cruise's while he was filming in Toronto.

Wasabi - powdered Japanese horseradish - is sold in Japanese food
shops and some supermarkets.

1. Combine fish sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, lime juice, orange juice,
mustard, honey and cayenne, whisking until smooth. Pour over fish; let
stand at least 10 minutes. 2. Combine salsa ingredients. 3. For tahini
butter: In small saucepan over high heat, bring to boil wine, vinegar,
onions, salt, pepper and cayenne. Boil about 5 minutes or until
reduced by half. Remove from heat. Add tahini, lime juice and butter,
mixing with electric hand mixer until smooth. 4. In bowl, combine
wasabi and water to form sauce-like consistency. 5. On plate, combine
flour and salt. Dredge fish with flour. Cook fish in oil in large
skillet over medium-high heat about 7 minutes, turning once, until
crisp, golden and just flaking. 6. To serve, place warm tahini butter
on individual plate. Drizzle decoratively with wasabi on top. Top
with fish. Garnish with salsa and extra fresh coriandr. 7. Makes 4
servings.
