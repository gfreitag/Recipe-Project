Some folks add tomatoes, some add okra, but whatever else you add, if
it has rice and peas, it then has to be called by it's White Trash
name of Hoppin' John.

Always eaten on New Year's Day, with the more you eat, the more good
luck you will have in the coming year.  Kaye Kay states "That's common
knowledge.  You can make it out of crowder, field or cow peas."
