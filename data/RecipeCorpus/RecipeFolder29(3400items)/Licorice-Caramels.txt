Categories: Candies
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Light corn syrup
1/8 ts Salt

1/2 ts Black or red coloring paste
1 c  Butter (not margarine)
2 c  Sugar
14 oz Can (1-1/4 cups) sweetened

"A mild, unbelievably delicious licorice flavor.  You'll find black
and red paste for coloring these candies in specialty and
cake-decorating stores. The black caramels also make great Halloween
treats--"

Line a 9 x 9 x 2 inch baking pan with foil, extending foil over he
edges of the pan.  Butter the foil; set aside.

In a heavy 3 quart saucepan melt the butter over low heat.  Add the
sugar, sweetened condensed milk, corn syrup, and salt; mix well.
Carefully clip a candy thermometer to side of the pan.

Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently; till candy thermometer
registers 244; firm-ball stage.  The mixture should boil at a
moderate, steady rate over entire surface.  Reaching firm-ball stage
should take 15 to 20 minutes. (Mixture scorches easily.)  Remove from
heat; remove candy thermometer from saucepan.  Add anise extract and
coloring, stir to mix.

Quickly pour candy, without scraping into the buttered-foil-lined
pan. Cool for several hours or till firm.  Use foil to lift candy out
of pan onto cutting board.  Peel foil away; discard.  With a buttered
sharp knife, cut immediately into 1-inch squares; wrap individually
in waxed paper.,  Makes 81 pieces (about 2-3/4 pounds)

To wrap caramels:  Tear off 6-inch strips of waxed paper; cut each
strip into 4 inch widths, making pieces 6 x 4 inches.  Roll caramel
in length of paper; fold flaps under.  Set caramels into gift boxes
with flaps underneath.  The caramels will pack neatly and stay
tightly wrapped.
