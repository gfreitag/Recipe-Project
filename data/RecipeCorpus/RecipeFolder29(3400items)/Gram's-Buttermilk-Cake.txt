1/4 ts Ground Cardamom
1 c  Buttermilk
1/2 ts Baking Soda
1 tb Water
4 lg Egg Whites
1/2 c  Crisco
1 1/2 c  Granulated Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
2 1/4 c  All-Purpose Flour

1/2 ts Wilton's Maple Flavoring
-(or more), optional
1/2 c  Pure Maple Syrup
8 tb Unsalted Butter
-at room temperature
* Preheat oven to 350 F.

1. Grease 3 9-inch round cake pans, and cut a circle of wax paper to
line the bottom of each.

2. In a large bowl, cream the Crisco and 1 cup of granulated sugar
together until light and fluffy. Beat in vanilla. Set aside.

3. Sift the flour, baking powder, and cardamom together. Set aside.

4. Pour the buttermilk into a bowl or 2-cup measure. Dissolve the
baking soda in the water and add to buttermilk.

5. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy, using a
stationary or hand-held electric mixer. Still beating, add remaining
1/2 cup of sugar gradually until soft peafs form.

6. Add the dry ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk mixture,
to the creamed mixture, beating well after each addition. Fold in egg
whites. Divide the batter between the 3 prepared pans.

7. Bake for 30 mins, or until a toothpick inserted in center of layer
comes out clean. Cool the layers, in the pans, on racks for 10 mins.
Turn the cakes out of the pans and let cool completely on racks.

8. Make the frosting. With a mixer, cream the maple syrup and butter
until fluffy and smooth. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar
beating well. Add the the optional maple flavoring. Beat until
frosting is smooth and shiny, 2 to 3 mins. Frost the 3-layer cake,
and decorate as desired.
