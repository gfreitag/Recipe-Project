Sometimes folks forget how satisfying oranges can be when served as a
dessert.

For each serving peel 1 or 1 1/2 oranges very carefully with a sharp
knife, removing all the white pith, and cut them into 3/8" slices.
Sugar them lightly, sprinkle them with orange flavored liqueur and
chill them.

In Spain and Mexico the oranges are peeled and sliced as above and
arranged in layers in a serving dish. Each layer is sprinkled with
confecitoner's sugar and cinnamon. Extra orange juice is sometimes
added.
