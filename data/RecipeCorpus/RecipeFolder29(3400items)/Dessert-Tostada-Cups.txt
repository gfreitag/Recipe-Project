Title: Dessert Tostada Cups
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 tostadas
6    Corn or flour tortillas
3 tb Butter
6 tb Sugar
Place 1/2 tablespoon of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a
frying pan large enough to hold a tortilla.  Set over medium heat
until the butter foams and the sugar melts.  Stir.  Add a tortilla to
the pan and fry over medium to medium-high heat until the tortilla
puffs up, about 1 minute.  Turn and fry on the other side until well
browned, about 1 minute more.  Remove the tortilla to a small bowl,
pressing down the center to fit the shape of the bowl.  Let cool
until set, then remove the tostada cup from the bowl.  Add more
butter and sugar to the pan and continue with another round until all
the tortillas are fried and formed.

TIPS:  These can be made several hours in advance.  They hold their
shape after cooling till set in a bowl.  Use 4-inch hors
d'oeuvre-size corn tortillas for smaller desserts.
