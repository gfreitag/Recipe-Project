This recipe was found in the DEERFIELD FAIR COOKBOOK, 1911. Like most
old recipes, it was very sparse on directions; since it assumed you
knew how to cook. The proportions here can be adjusted since you
obviously will not be making this much.

Sprinkle a little salt between each layer of meat. Pour brine over
meat scalding hot. YIELD: Makes a lot.

Another old recipe from the section on the DEERFIELD FAIR of
Deerfield, N.H. Fair dates: 4 days, 1st week in October.
