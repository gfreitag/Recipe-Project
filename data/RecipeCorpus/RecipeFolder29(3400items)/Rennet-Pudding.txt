Categories: Desserts, Puddings

Nutmeg
2 c  Milk

From the Joy of Cooking: "This favorite English dish is made of milk,
coagulated with extract from the lining of unweaned calve's
stomachs.It has a consistency much like that of a tender blanc-mange"
[cornstarch or almond milk with gelatin pudding].

Put into a bowl in which it will be served, the milk warmed to
exactly 98 deg F, add the sugar, rennet and brandy. Let stand 1 1/2
hrs to coagulate and sprinkle with the spices.
