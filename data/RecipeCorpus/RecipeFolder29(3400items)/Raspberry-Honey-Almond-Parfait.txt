For Honey-Almond Parfait: =========================

Place outer ring of 8-inch springform pan on flat serving plate;
put in freezer.  Whip 1/2 cup cream until stiff; refrigerate.

In top of double boiler or mixer bowl that fits snugly into a
saucepan, whisk together egg, egg yolk, honey and vanilla seeds.
Place over pan of boiling water and whisk vigorously until lightly
thickened, 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove from heat and continue beating
until thick and completely cooled.

Fold in almonds and reserved whipped cream.  Pour into chilled
springform mold.  Dip a finger in cold water and run around rim of
mixture, forming clean edge.  Return to freezer.

For Raspberry Parfait: ======================

Coarsely mash 14 ounces raspberries in food mill, processor or
with back of large wooden spoon.  Place in saucepan with 1/3 cup
sugar and bring to boil.  Boil gently, stirring often, for 5 minutes.
Strain to eliminate seeds.  Transfer to shallow bowl and cool in
freezer or refrigerate.

Meanwhile whip 1 cup cream until stiff; refrigerate.  Beat egg
whites until they form soft peaks; then gradually add 1/2 cup sugar
and continue to beat until stiff and shiny.  Partially fold in cooked
raspberry puree and framboise; add whipped cream and gently fold
until blended. Pour mixture over honey-almond layer in springform
mold, smoothing top with spatula.  Freeze several hours or overnight.

For Raspberry Sauce: ====================

In saucepan, combine all sauce ingredients except lemon juice.
Bring to boil, then boil gently, stirring, about 7 minutes.  Reduce
heat, stir in lemon juice, and keep warm.

To garnish, remove parfait from freezer.  Carefully release
springform ring (if difficult, warm ring slightly withy your palms).
Whip 1/2 cup cream until stiff; form decorative border or rosettes
around top and bottom edge of parfait by piping whipped cream through
pastry bag fitted with star tip.  Arrange 2 raspberries and 2 or 3
almond slices on top of each serving.  Cut into wedges.  Serve with
warm raspberry sauce, if desired.
