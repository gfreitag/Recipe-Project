Title: Asparagus Sauce - Great Chefs
Categories: Basics, Salsa/sauce, Masterchefs
Yield: 1 servings
Salt (to taste)
Pepper (to taste)
1 1/2 lb Asparagus, medium/small
2 oz Butter, unsalted
2 c  Cream, heavy
Wash the asparagus and snap off the white ends.  Set aside all
tops and half that number of ends.  Plunge the tops into a large pot
of salted, boiling water and cook until limp but not for too long.
(Note: Cook slightly longer than for eating.  If undercooked, they
will not process well; if overcooked, they will taste earthy.)

Drain the asparagus thoroughly and, while still hot, run it
through food processor with unsalted butter for 3 - 4 minutes until
smooth, scraping down the sides of the processor frequently.

Meanwhile, chop asparagus ends to remove the dry hard field cuts
and simmer with cream.  Cook the ends slowly for 20 minutes, then
strain, pressing through gently.  Just before serving, combine
asparagus, butter and cream.  Heat slowly to just below boiling
point. Adjust the seasonings to taste.

Preparation time:  3/4 Hour
