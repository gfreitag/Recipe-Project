Title: Poori - Fried Puffed Bread
Categories: Breads, Indian
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Water (approx)
Vegetable shortening OR oil
For deep frying
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1/4 lb Butter
Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Using 2 knives or a pastry
cutter, cut in the butter until small particles are formed. Stir in
the water to make a soft dough. Put the dough on a lightly floured
board and knead until it is smooth and holds together. Roll out the
dough very thin with a lightly floured rolling pin. Cut the dough
into 5-inch circles. Heat the vegetable shortening or oil until it
reaches a temperature of 370 F. Fry a few pieces of dough at a time
for 2 to 3 minutes, turning once until lightly browned. Drain. Serve
hot. Makes 8 to 10. From: Marianne Riolo-Minahan Date: 28 Mar 94
