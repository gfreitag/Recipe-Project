*** Bouquet garni is a bag made of cheesecloth containing leek,
parsley, thyme, and bay leaf tied inside of it.  It adds flavor and
aroma to your dish without leaving the solid herbs and spices in the
dish itself. After use, the cheesecloth bag is removed and discarded.

Heat butter in medium saucepan.

Add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.

Add bouquet garni and wine; bring to a boil.

Meanwhile, in mixing bowl, mash together marrow and flour with
fork until nearly smooth.  Whisk into wine mixture and boil gently,
whisking occasionally, until reduced by half.

Add Veal Stock and simmer gently until thickened enough to coat a
spoon lightly.
