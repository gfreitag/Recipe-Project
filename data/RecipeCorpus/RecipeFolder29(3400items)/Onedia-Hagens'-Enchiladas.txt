Categories: Countyfairs, Main dish
Yield: 24 servings
1/4 c  Flour
2 tb Chili Powder
2 c  Stewed Tomatoes,
With Juice, chopped
20    To 40 Corn Tortillas
Vegetable Oil, for frying
1 lb Velveeta Cheese, grated
Chopped Scallions,

(See Note), optional
2 lb Ground Beef, Lean,

2 1/2 c  Onion, chopped
1 tb Salt
1 ts Black Pepper, freshly
Ground
3 c  Water
4 tb Butter
2    Bell Peppers
Seeded and chopped
2    Cloves Garlic, minced
NOTE: Use a combination of cherry and jalapenos.

1. First, cook the meat. In a large heavy pot, place the meat, 1/2
cup of onion, 2 tsp of salt and black pepper. Add the water and bring
to a boil; then lower the heat and simmer for about 20 mins. Remove
from heat and let juices rise.

2. In a large heavy soup pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter over
moderate heat. Cook the remaining 2 cups of onion, the peppers and
garlic for abour 6 mins, stirring constantly. Stir in flour, the
remaining tsp of salt and the chili powder. Stir for 2 mins. Add the
tomatoes.

3. Draw off 2 cups of the meat stock and add the the chili mixture.
(The meat should now be rather dry. If not, cook it down for a few
mins.) Set the meat aside. Simmer the chili mixture, uncovered, until
thick, about 40 mins, stirring often.

4. Lightly fry the corn tortillas in oil just until they turn limp.
Dip them into the sauce, and fill with about 3 Tbs meat and
sprinkling of grated cheese. Roll up, and arrange on a warm platter
and top with remaining sauce, meat and cheese. Add a sprinkling of
scallions. Serve hot peppers on the side, if desired. (This is a mild
version, but you can add more chili powder if you want a hotter
version.)
