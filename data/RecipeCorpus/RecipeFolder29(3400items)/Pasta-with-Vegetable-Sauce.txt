Title: Pasta with Vegetable Sauce
Categories: Low cal/fat, Healthy
Yield: 1 servings
4 oz Vegetables
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Basil
Black Pepper
2 1/2 oz Eggless pasta
2 md Tomatoes
1 sm Onion
2 ts Garlic
Preparation:

Prepare the vegetables; chop the tomatoe and peel and chop the onion
and garlic clove.

For the 115g of vegetables, any that you have in the cupboard can be
used.

I used the following:

fennel onion leek celery red chilli green chilli

I also added some fennel seed, oregano, basil and mustard seed to the
pasta before serving, as well as a bit of Pesto and low fat spread.

Directions

1. Bring a pot of water to a rapid boil and add the pasta. Boil for
10/12 minutes until just tender.

(I microwaved the pasta, which was fresh, for 7-8
minutes in a 650W microwave on high - works just as well as
boiling.
If you do this, add boiling water to cover the pasta before you
microwave it)

2. Place the chopped tomatoes in a saucepan (or large frying pan) over
a medium heat. Stir frequently until the liquid begins to bubble.

3. Add the onion and garlic and stir frequently until soft. Add the
remaining ingredients, stir well and leave to cook for 10-15
minutes,
stirring occasionally. Add a little water if necessary.

4. Drain the pasta, serve onto a warmed plate and spoon the sauce
over.

NB: instead of two chopped tomatoes I used a 435g (for 2 people) tin
of
chopped tomatoes with peppers and onions and added a little water
because there didn't seem to be enough liquid for the vegetables
to
cook.
