Title: Granola III
Categories: Breakfast, Nuts/grains
Yield: 12 servings
1/4 c  Honey
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Toasted wheat germ
1/2 c  Raisins
2 1/2 c  Quick-cooking oatmeal
1 c  Shredded coconut
1/3 c  Untoasted sunflower seeds
1/4 c  Hulled sesame seeds
4 tb Margarine
1/4 c  (packed) dark brown sugar
Preheat the oven to 300F.

Spread the oatmeal, coconut, sunflower seeds and sesame seeds in a
large, lightly  buttered roasting pan or ovenproof dish (about 11x17
inches is best, although a smaller pan will do).  Bake for about 20
minutes, tossing several times.

Meanwhile, combine in a small saucepan the margarine, brown sugar,
honey and salt and bring to a simmer, stirring.  Add the vanilla off
the heat.

Reset the oven to 350~ then add the wheat germ to the toasted mixture.
Dribble the sugar-honey mixture syrup over the granola, tossing with
a fork to coat the dry mixture evenly.

Return the pan to the oven and bake for 5-6 minutes longer.  Add the
raisins, toss to distribute, and press the granola down firmly into
an even layer. Bake 5 minutes or so longer, or until the granola is
golden.

Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.  Slip a flexible spatula
under the granola to break in to large pieces.  Let cool completely
and store airtight.

Makes 6 cups.
