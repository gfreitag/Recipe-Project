Title: Simple Baked Eggplant
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
1 ea Low-sodium tamari
1 ea Balsamic vinegar
1 ea Red pepper to taste
1 ea Eggplant sliced 1/2" thick
1 ea Sliced tomato
1 ea Basil to taste
Bake eggplant on a baking sheet at 400 degrees for about 8-10
minutes. When I turned the slices over and topped them with basil and
sliced tomato like the recipe said, I brushed them with a mixture of
low-sodium tamari and balsamic vinegar. I added some pieces of red
pepper at this time, too, and brushed them with the mixture. Eight
minutes or so more in the oven, and it was YUMMY!
