"The night before you plan to barbecue, stir together the dry rub
ingredients in a small bowl. Combine 2 tablespoons of the rub with the
other marinade ingredients in a blender and puree. Place the brisket
in a plastic bag and pour the marinade over it. Refrigerate the
brisket overnight.
Before you begin to barbecue, take the brisket from the
refrigerator. Drain and discard the marinade. Pat the brisket down
with all but 2 tbsps of the remaining rub, coating the slab well. Let
the brisket sit at room temperature for about 45 minutes.
Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature up to
200 to 220 degrees F.
Transfer the brisket to the smoker and cook for 3 hours. Place the
meat on a sheet of heavy-duty foil, sprinkle it with the rest of the
rub, and close the foil tightly. Cook for an additional 1-1/2 to 2
hours, until well-done and tender.
Let the brisket sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Trim any
excess fat and slice the brisket thinly against the grain, changing
direction as the grain changes...". Serve with your favorite barbecue
sauce.
