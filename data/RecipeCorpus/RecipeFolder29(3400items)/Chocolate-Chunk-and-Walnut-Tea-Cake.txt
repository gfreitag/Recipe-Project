Title: Chocolate Chunk and Walnut Tea Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Chocolate
Yield: 1 loaf
3/4 c  Chopped walnuts
8 tb Unsalted butter; softened
3/4 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 c  Light brown sugar
2    Extra-large eggs
1 ts Vanilla extract
2/3 c  Milk
1 1/4 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1/4 c  Plus 2 tablespoons unsifted
-cake flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
2    Bars (3 oz each) bittersweet
-bar chocolate*; cut into
-small chunks
*Such as Lindt "Excellence" or Tobler "Tradition"

Preheat the oven to 350F.  Butter and flour a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan.

Sift together the all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder and
salt. Toss the chocolate chunks and walnuts with 1 tablespoon of the
sifted mixture.

Cream the butter in the large bowl of an electric mixer on moderate
speed for 3 minutes.  Add the granulated sugar and beat on moderately
high speed for 2 minutes.  Add the light brown sugar and continue
beating for 1 minute longer.  Beat in the eggs, one at a time,
blending well after each addition.  Beat in the vanilla extract.  On
low speed, add half of the sifted ingredients, the milk, then balance
of the sifted ingredients, mixing just until the particles of flour
are absorbed. Stir in the chocolate chunks and walnuts.

Pour and scrape the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake the cake for
55 minutes to 1 hour, or until nicely risen and a wooden pick
inserted into the cake emerges clean and dry.  The baked cake will
pull away slightly from the sides of the pan.

Cool the cake in the pan on a rack for 3 to 4 minutes, invert onto
another rack and turn rightside up.  Cool completely.  Store in an
airtight container.
