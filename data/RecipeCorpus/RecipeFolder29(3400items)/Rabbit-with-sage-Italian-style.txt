Title: Rabbit with sage Italian style
Categories: Game, Italian
Yield: 4 servings
Salt and Pepper to taste
Flour for dredging
1 ts Balsamic vinegar
1 c  Dry white wine
2 c  Chicken stock
4 sl Bacon
2    Garlic cloves, peeled
1 tb Dried sage
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
3 lb Rabbit, cut into 8 pieces
Chop the bacon and the garlic very fine. Crumble and add the sage.
Season the rabbit parts with salt and pepper and dredge them lightly
in the flour. Heat the vegetable oil in a large casserole, add the
rabbit and cook until browned, turning it once, about 3 minutes per
side. Discard the oil from the casserole. Add the bacon mixture, and
return to the heat, cooking 3 minutes and stirring occasionally. Add
the Balsamic vinegar and white wine, and simmer 5 minutes. Add 1 cup
of the stock, salt and pepper to taste, and cover the casserole.
Simmer until the rabbit is tender, about one hour, stirring
occasionally and adding the remaining stock gradually to keep the
meat moist. Transfer the rabbit pieces to a large serving dish and
pour the sauce over them.
