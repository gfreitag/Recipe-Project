slice the salmon crosswise 1/8 inch thick.

Wasabi Sauce: In a food processor, combine the wasabi powder,
vinegar, and mustard. Add cup water and with machine on, slowly pour
in the oil to form a lightly thickened sauce. Add the salt and
process briefly. Makes about 1 cup.

Chive Oil: In a food processor, mince the chives with the lemon juice
and salt. With machine on, slowly pour in the oil and blend until
smooth. Transfer the oil to a jar and let steep overnight in the
refrigerator.

The next day, return the oil to room temperature, then strain into a
clean jar. Makes about  cup.
