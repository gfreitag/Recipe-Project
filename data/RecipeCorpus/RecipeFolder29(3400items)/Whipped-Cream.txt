Title: Whipped Cream
Categories: Information, Desserts
Yield: 1 text file  This is whipping cream, at least one day old which is expanded from 1
cup to 2 cups by the incorporation of air. The bowl, beaters and
cream should ALL be chilled to produce firm whipped cream that is not
oily. In warm weather beat over ice to avoid turning into butter. To
beat cream in an electric beater, start at medium until the cream
starts to thicken ,then lower the speed and watch carefully not to
over beat or churn.

If it's absolutely necessary to hold whipped cream up to 24 hours,
incorporate a small amount of gelatin, confectioner's sugar or
cornstarch.

For sweetened or flavored whipped cream add to each 2 cups of whipped
cream [1 cup of whipping cream] 1 to 3 Tbl Confectioner's sugar, 1/2
tsp vanilla, 1 Tbl rum or liqueur, or up to 1/2 cup jam, marmalade or
fruit puree'. Submitted By JIM WELLER   On   04-05-95
