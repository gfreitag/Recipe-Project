NOTE: This recipe was developed by a long-ago next door neighbor.
She used to serve it to her family with tomato soup and crackers, for
supper.  My family liked it with a green vegetable or salad, and
crusty bread. I also liked to serve it with fresh boiled corn on the
cob. SHARED with pride by Jean Polzin
