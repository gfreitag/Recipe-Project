Title: Basil Puree - Great Chefs
Categories: Basics, Masterchefs
Yield: 1 cup
3/4 c  Oil, olive
1 bn Basil, washed, stemmed
Puree the basil with 1/2 cup of olive oil.  Cover with a bit of
olive oil and refrigerate for up to two weeks if desired.  (The
length of time the basil is in oil helps to diffuse the flavor into
the oil. On the other hand, after two weeks, the fresh basil begins
to lose its bouquet, and taste to natural spoilage.

Discard after 6 weeks and start fresh.
