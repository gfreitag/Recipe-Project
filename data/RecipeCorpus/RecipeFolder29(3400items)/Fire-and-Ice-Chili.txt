Recipe by: Kenny Rogers, Midwest Living, October 1994
Drain the pineapple, reserving the syrup.  In a Dutch oven, cook
the pork, half at a time, in hot olive oil until brown. Return all of
the meat to the pot. Add the first chopped onion and 1 garlic clove.
Cook over medium heat until the onion is tender, stirring
occasionally. Add the reserved pineapple syrup, undrained tomatoes,
tomato paste, green chili peppers, green pepper, onion, 2 garlic
cloves, chili powder, cumin, jalapenos and salt.  Bring to boiling;
reduce the heat. Cover and simmer the chili for 1 1/2 hours, stirring
occasionally. Add the pineapple chunks. Cover and simmer for 30
minutes longer.  Let the diners add their own toppers.  Makes 8 to 10
servings. Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).
