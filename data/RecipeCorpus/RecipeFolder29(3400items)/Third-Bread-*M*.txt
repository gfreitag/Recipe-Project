Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Honey
3 c  Bread flour

===FOR 11/2 LB. LOAF===
1 pk Yeast
1 1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Rye flour
Put ingredients into pan in the order listed, select white bread

and push start.
NOTE: Using  two flours and a meal, this is called third bread and

was found in many old cookbooks. It is a light, honey colored

bread. It will sink a bit in the middle, but has a chewy crust and

a sweet, very satisfying flavor.
