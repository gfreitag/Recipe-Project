Chef Roland Huet of Christian's restaurant is a Gallic perpetual
motion machine.  He is everywhere at once, chopping here, shaking a
pan there, stirring everywhere.  Each movement is quick, but carefully
measured, so that nothing is wasted.  When he comes to rest, it is to
present a finished dish of the highest order.

Chef Huet is French, but his cooking at Christian's is an
amalgam of French and New Orleans cuisine.  His mousseline de
poisson, sauce Nantua, is pure French, but he uses Louisiana redfish
for the mousseline and local crawfish for the sauce.  All of his
dishes reflect his French mastery of cooking and many call on local
touches to give them their special cachet.

One of Chef Huet's maxims is to prepare everything from scratch.
He even makes his own vinegar for the chicken dish and his own ice
cream for the dessert.  He also has a smoker to provide his with the
highest quality smoked products.

Although you can follow Chef Huet's recipes and create delicious
dishes, you should allow plenty of time to complete them.
Perseverance and care,m coupled with proper ingredients, will yield
the desired results.
