Makes 2 cups.  This basic white sauce, although attributed to the
French, was widely used in ancient Greek cookery.

Melt butter in a pan, add flour, and stir until smooth.  Lower heat,
and gradually add the hot milk, stirring constantly until it
thickens. Season with salt and pepper.

VARIATIONS:

When used for Moussaka, add a dash of nutmeg.

When used with Pastitsio add 1/2 tsp cinnamon.

FISH:  Substitute fish stock or clam broth for half of the milk in the
basic sauce and add the juice of one lemon.  For fish casseroles,
pour the sauce over the fish, dot with butter, sprinkle with grated
cheese, and lightly brown under the broiler.

FOWL:  Substitute chicken stock or stock from the entree for half of
the milk.  Add a dash of cinnamon, a dash of brandy and a tsp of
grated orange peel.

VEGETABLES:  Substitute chicken stock for half of the milk in the
basic recipe, add the juice of one lemon, a dash of thyme and 1/2 cup
grated cheese.  Blend well and serve heated over the vegetables.

PASTA:  To 2 cups bechamel sauce, add 1 cup chicken stock, 1 cup
grated cheese, and 1/4 lb butter.  Blend until smooth and use for
macaroni and noodle casseroles.  For an enhanced flavor, add crumbled
feta cheese, and brown a few minutes under the broiler before serving
the pasta.

RAISIN SAUCE:  Soak raisins in the sherry for about an hour.  To one
cup of bechamel sauce, add the raisins, nutmeg, cinnamon and lemon
juice. Simmer over medium fire, stirring frequently, for 15 minutes
until the sauce is well blended.  This is excellent over broiled fish
and fowl, either as a sauce or lightly broiled under broiler.

GRAPE SAUCE:  To one cup bechamel sauce, add the grapes, brandy, pan
drippings and butter in a skillet.  Simmer while stirring with a
wooden spoon until smooth.  Taste for salt and pepper and enrich to
your taste by adding butter and more brandy.  If a sweeter sauce is
desired, add 1/4 cup of the liquid from the grapes.
