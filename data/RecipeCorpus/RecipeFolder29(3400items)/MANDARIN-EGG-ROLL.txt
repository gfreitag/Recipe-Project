Title: MANDARIN EGG ROLL
Categories: Stir fry, Chinese, Meats, Appetizers
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Bean sprouts
1 c  Shredded celery
1    Scallion, shredded
1 ts Sesame seed oil
Salt and white pepper
8    Riceflour egg roll wrappers
1    Egg white; lightly beaten
1 1/2 c  Dried black mushrooms
5 1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1/2 ts Crushed fresh garlic
1/2 ts Crushed ginger root
1/2 c  Cooked ground pork
1 tb Cooking wine
1/2 c  Cooked shrimp
1 c  Shredded bamboo shoots
Soak the mushrooms in hot water 15 minutes. Drain, cut off tough
stems and shred to make 1/2 cup.  Place 1/4 cup oil in a wok over
high heat until hot. Add the garlic, ginger and pork.  Stir-fry 2
minutes. Add the cooking wine and shrimp and stir-fry 2 minutes. Add
the mushrooms and remaining vegetables and stir-fry 2 minutes.  Add
the sesame seed oil and salt to taste. Mix. Drain off excess liquid
and set the vegetable mixture aside. In a clean wok, heat 5 cups
vegetable oil to the boiling point, about 400 F. Working with one at
a time, lay the egg roll wrappers on the counter and place 1/8 of the
reserved vegetable mixture on one end of each. Moisten the edges of
the wrapper with the egg white and roll the wrapper, tucking in the
ends at both sides of wrapper as you roll. Deep-fry the egg roll
about 5 to 10 minute. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels.
