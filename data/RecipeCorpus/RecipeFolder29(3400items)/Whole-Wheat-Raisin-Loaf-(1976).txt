Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off.  In large bowl,
combine 1 1/2 c flour, 1/2 c sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and yeast;
mix well.  In medium saucepan, heat milk, water and oil until very
warm (120 to 130 degrees).  Add warm liquid to flour mixture. Blend
at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. By
hand, stir in whole wheat flour, rolled oats, raisins and an
additional 1/4 to 3/4 c flour until dough pulls cleanly away from
sides of bowl.
On floured surface, knead in remaining 1/4 to 3/4 c flour until
dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Place dough in greased
bowl; cover loosely with greased plastic wrap and cloth towel. Let
rise in warm place (80 to 85 degrees) until light and doubled in
size, 20 to 30 minutes.
Grease two 8 x 4 or 9 x 5 inch loaf pans.  Punch down dough several
times to remove all air bubbles.  Divide dough in half; shape into
loaves. Place in greased pans.  Cover; let rise in warm place until
light and doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes.
Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Uncover dough.  Bake 40 to 50 minutes or
until deep golden brown and loaves sound hollow when lightly tapped.
If loaves become too brown, cover loosely with foil last 10 minutes
of baking. Immediately remove from pans; cool on wire racks. Brush
tops of loaves with butter; sprinkle with 1 t sugar. Lenora Smith, LA.
