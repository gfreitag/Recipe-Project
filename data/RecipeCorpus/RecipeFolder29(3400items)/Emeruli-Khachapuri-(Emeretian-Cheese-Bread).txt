Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
pn Salt
1 c  Unbleached Flour
1/2 c  Yogurt
1 tb Sunflower Oil
1/2 ts Baking Soda
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
(See Below) -- grated
1    Egg
1 lb English Lancashire Cheese

Tkemali -- (see recipe)
Preheat oven to 400 F. Mix the yogurt, oil, baking soda, and salt in a
medium bowl. Add the flour, mix well, and knead for 6 to 8 mins to
promote elasticity. Work in extra flour if the dough is a bit sticky.
Let the dough rest while preparing the filling. Beat the egg lightly.
Reserve 1 tsp of the egg for glazing the bread. Mix the remaining egg
with the grated cheese. (NOTE: you may substitute 1/2 lb Lancashire
and 1/2 lb Monterey jack, grated; OR you may substitute a
medium-sharp white cheddar.) Put the dough on a floured surface and
roll it into a circle 12 to 14 inches round by 1/4-inch thick. Put
the cheese and egg mixture on top of the dough and spread to within 2
inches of edge. Pick up the edges of the dough and gather them
together like a drawstring bag. Press out all the air, thenpinch and
seal the edges together. Pat the surface with floured hands and
gently flip the khachapuri over, sealed side down, onto a nonstick
baking sheet. Glaze the top with reserved egg and make a small
1/2-inch hole in the center to allow steam and heat to escape while
it is baking. Place in the upper 3rd of oven. Bake for 5 mins, then
reduce the heat to 350 degrees and bake for 15 to 20 mins. Serve hot,
cut into wedges or slices, with tkemali, as an appetizer or a snack.
To cook on top of stove, do not glaze or make a hole in the center.
Cook uncovered, over low to medium heat for 8 to 10 mins in a lightly
oiled cast-iron griddle or frying pan. Turn and cook on the 2nd side
until golden. Brush top with melted butter once cooked. (Author's
Note): Puri dough may be substituted. Authentic homemade khachapuri
is made with yogurt/baking soda dough. Yeast dough (puri) is more
commercial.
