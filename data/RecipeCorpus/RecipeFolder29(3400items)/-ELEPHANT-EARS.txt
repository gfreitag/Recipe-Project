Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Add milk, sugar, salt, shortening, and
2 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to
form a soft dough. On a floured board, knead until smooth and
elastic, 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl; turn once to grease
top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch down and shape into 15 ovals, 5 1/2" round by 1/8" thick. Heat
3-4" of oil to 375 degrees in a deep-fat fryer. Fry ovals, one at a
time, 3 minutes per side or until golden brown. Drain. Mix sugar and
cinnamon; sprinkle over warm pastries.
