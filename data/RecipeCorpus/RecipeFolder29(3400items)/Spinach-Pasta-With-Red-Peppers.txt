Title: Spinach Pasta With Red Peppers
Categories: Fatfree, Pasta, Vegetables
Yield: 5 servings
1 ts Rosemary, crushed
1 c  Water
1 ea Lemon juice to taste
3 lg Red peppers, sliced thinly
1    Box wide spinach noodles (24
Oz)
10    (or more) cloves of garlic,
Pressed
3 tb Capers plus a bit of caper
Liquid (more if you love
Capers)
1 tb Basil
Saute garlic, herbs and capers by your favorite saute method.  Add
water and red peppers, and simmer the red peppers until they are
slightly softened. A bit of crunch is a good thing. There should be a
fair amount of liquid left when you are done simmering.

Cook some wide spinach noodles (I used 24oz for five of us) until
they are just a hair underdone and then drain.  Toss them with the
peppers and liquid over a low heat until pasta is coated and liquid
is absorbed.
