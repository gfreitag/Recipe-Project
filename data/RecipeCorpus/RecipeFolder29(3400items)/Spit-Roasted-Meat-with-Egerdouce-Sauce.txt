In medieval Europe, the spits were turned by kitchen boys and were
periodically dusted with spices and herbs.  Since forks were still
most unknown, the slices of meat were eaten in the fingers, but
accompanied by sauces.  These were laid in small dishes (sauc-ers)
along the tables, and diners would dip the little finger of the right
hand only into the sauce and spread it on their meat.  This finder
was never licked but carefully wiped on a napkin out of respect for
fellow diners.

In the modern kitchen -- any joint of meat can be used, but it should
be flavoured if the egerdouce sauce is to be served with it.  Cook it
on a spit, a barbeque, or on an open rack in the oven.  Sprinkle it
lightly with ground mixed herbs, plus a little of any spice that you
fancy.

DIRECTIONS:

Gently cook the onions in the oil till they are soft.  Add the fruit
and spices and cook for a few minutes.  Melt the sugar in the wine
and vinegar and add this to the onion and fruits.  Simmer all
together, covered for 15 minutes, then process or liquidise.  Return
the mixture to the pan and add the breadcrumbs and enough water to
make a thick but not claggy sauce. Adjust the seasoning to taste and
serve with the roast meat.
