To prepare dough:  In food processor (or strong blender) fitted with
steel blade combine water, yeast and sugar.  Let stand 10 minutes
until foamy. Add flour and salt.  Pulse 3 to 4 times to combine. With
machine running, add oil.  Process dough for 40 seconds to knead. On
lightly floured surface, knead dough an additional 2 to 3 minutes,
adding a little more flour if necessary.

Place dough in medium bowl brushed with oil.  Turn to coat.  Cover
with clean towel or plastic wrap.  Let rise in warm, draft-free place
until doubled in size (about 1 hour).

To prepare topping:  Combine peanut butter, 1 tablespoon oil, vinegar,
chili powder and cumin in small bowl.  Set aside.

Preheat oven to 500F.

Lightly oil 12-inch pizza pan.  Punch down dough.  Place in center of
pan. With fingers, press dough to edges of pan.

Spread peanut butter mixture to within 1/2-inch of edge.  Sprinkle
remaining ingredients evenly over top.  Drizzle with remaining oil.

Bake 12 to 15 minutes on bottom rack of oven until crisp and browned.
