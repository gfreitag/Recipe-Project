Title: Majorcan 'Pizza' (Coca)
Categories: Vegetables, Appetizers, Breads
Yield: 1 servings
5 lg Garlic coves, minced
2 lg Red bell peppers, chopped
1 bn Swiss chard, ribs removed
-and thinly sliced. Leaves
-thinly sliced
2 ea 1 Lb frozen bread doughs
-thawed
9 tb Olive oil
1/2 ts Black pepper
2 md Onions, chopped
Place each loaf of bread dough in a separate bowl. Add 1 Tbsp of oil
to each bowl, season each with 1/4 tsp pepper. Knead each in the bowl
until the oil is well incorporated, about 3 minutes. Let dough rest
in the bowl for 10 minutes.

Oil two baking sheets. Turn out dough on to a floured surface and
knead 1 minute. Roll out with a floured rolling pin into an irregular
rectangle, pulling and stretching the dough as necessary. Transfer to
a prepared sheet and brush with 1 Tbsp of oil. Let dough rise
uncovered in a warm draft-free spot about 30 minutes (until puffy).

Preheat oven to 400 F.  Heat 3 Tbsp of oil in a large skillet. Add the
onions and garlic, saute for 1 minute. Add bell peppers and chard
ribs and saute until tender, about 10 minutes. Add chard leaves and
saute until wilted (about 3 minute) and coated with oil. Season with
salt & pepper.

Make indentations all over the dough with your fingers. Brush with
olive oil. Spread vegetables over the dough leaving a 1" border. Bake
until golden about 25 minutes. Serve warm or room temperature.

Cocas are a traditional street food in Palma, Spain.  The name comes
from the Latin verb coquere, meaning to cook.  These are usually
eaten as a snack but make a great appetizer to a meal.  I have also
made these using arugula lettuce instead of the chard. And of course
you can use your favorite home-made bread or pizza dough instead of
frozen dough.
