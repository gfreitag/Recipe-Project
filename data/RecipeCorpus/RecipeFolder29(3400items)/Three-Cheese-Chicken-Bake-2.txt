Title: Three Cheese Chicken Bake 2
Categories: Casseroles, Poultry, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Pimentos, chopped
1/2 ts Basil leaves
1 1/2 c  Cheese, cottage
2 c  Chicken; cooked
1/2 c  Cheese, parmesan, grated
8 oz Lasagna noodles
1/2 c  Onions, chopped
1/2 c  Bell peppers, chopped
10 1/2 oz Soup, cream of chicken
4 oz Mushrooms
May use skim milk or low-fat cottage cheese. Turkey may be
substituted for chicken.

Preheat oven to 350.  Cube chicken. Cook noodles for about 10 minutes
in spaghetti blancher or large pot. Combine onions and pepper in
small amount of water in saucepan and cook until onion is tender.

Drain, then add soup, mushrooms, pimento, milk, and basil. Layer HALF
of soup mixture, half of cottage cheese, half of chicken, and half of
parmesan in casserole. Repeat layers. Cover and bake for 30 minutes.

Sylvia's comments: don't ask me why this is a "three cheese" bake when
there are only two types of cheese. I skipped the onion and bell
pepper and substituted chopped green olives for the pimento. I also
used three-color rotini (which I had) for the lasagna noodles I
didn't have. Came out great. Definitely a keeper.
