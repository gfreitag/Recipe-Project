Title: Orange-Ginger Sauce
Categories: Desserts, Salsa/sauce, Condiments
Yield: 1 cup
1 1/2 oz Fresh ginger; peeled, and
-cut into very 1-inch long
-matchsticks; about 1/4 cup
1 1/2 c  Fresh orange juice
1/2 c  Triple Sec or other orange
-liqueur
1 c  Sugar
Combine all of the ingredients in a small nonreactive saucepan.
Bring to a boil, stirring to melt the sugar.  Cook at a low boil
until the mixture lightly coats a wooden spoon and drips rather than
runs off the spoon, about 30 minutes.  Chill before serving, or cover
and refrigerate for up to several weeks.

Makes 1 1/4 cups.

This can keep in the freezer for several months, but it won't freeze
solid.
