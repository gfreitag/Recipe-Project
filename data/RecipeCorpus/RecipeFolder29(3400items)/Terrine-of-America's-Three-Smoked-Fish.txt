For Mousse: ===========

Process fish fillets, smoked white fish, and egg yolks to smooth
puree in processor, working in batches as necessary and scraping down
sides occasionally.  Add egg whites one by one, blending well.
Gradually add cream, scraping sides of bowl as needed.  Transfer
mousse to bowl and place bowl in a larger bowl of ice.  Stir in 1/2
cup parsley, hot pepper sauce, salt and a pinch of pepper.  Adjust
seasonings to taste and chill well.

Lightly butter a 12 x 3 x 4-inch ceramic terrine (a standard 9 x
3-inch loaf pan can also be used).  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Place well
chilled smoked salmon on work surface and split it down center,
removing any small bones.  Cut each half into rectangles about 2
inches wide and the length of the mold, squaring off edges neatly.
Cut two rectangles of smoked sturgeon to the same size.

Use a rubber spatula to spread 1/4 inch layer of mousse evenly
over the bottom and sides of the mold.  Lay one rectangle of smoked
salmon down the center.  Spread a 1/2 inch thick layer of mousse over
the salmon, smoothing neatly.  Top with a layer of smoked sturgeon,
then 1/2 inch layer of mousse; repeat until mold is filled, ending
with smooth layer of mousse. Tap filled pan gently on work surface to
eliminate air bubbles. Top with buttered aluminum foil, buttered side
down.  Wrap a second layer of foil over top and place mold in a
roasting pan.

Place the pan on the center rack of your oven and pour hot water
into roasting pan to come about halfway up outside of terrine.  Bake
45 to 60 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in center comes out
clean (a 9 x 3 inch mold may take as long as 1 hour and 10 minutes.)
Remove the mold from the water bath and cool on rack.

For Dressing: =============

Place egg yolks and water in bowl of mixer and beat until
creamy.  Add oil very slowly.  When about half of the oil has been
incorporated, begin alternating oil and vinegar, adding them in a
thin stream.  Whisk in sour cream briefly, then Champagne.  Add salt
and pepper and chill dressing, thinning, if necessary, with a little
milk.

To garnish; separate the hard cooked egg yolks from egg whites
and chop each coarsely.  Use a napkin to press whites and yolks
separately through a sieve.

To serve, run a knife around the edges of the terrine, then
unmold by inverting it onto a serving platter.  Holding a kitchen
towel dipped in hot water over the mold for a few seconds, lift off
the mold.  Slice the terrine with a knife dipped in cold water.
Cover the bottom of each chilled serving plate with dressing.  Center
a slice of terrine on each plate. Surround the terrine with a ring of
chopped egg yolk and egg white, onion and parsley.  Place 6 small
spoonfuls of caviar, 2 of each kind of roe, over the garnishes around
the plate.

Serve immediately.
