Terrific meal." - Karen
2
(4 oz.) shredded sharp cheddar 2 tsp. dill weed 1 egg 3/4 cup milk

In a large bowl, combine flour and sugar.  Cut in butter until
crumbly; stir in the cheese and dill. In a small bowl, beat egg and
milk; pour into dry ingredients and stir just until moistened. Batter
will be very thick. Pour into a greased 8x4x2" loaf pan. Bake at 350
degrees for 35-40 minutes or until bread tests done. Cool in pan 10
minutes before removing to a wire rack.

*Note: As a substitute for self-rising flour, place 1 Tbsp. baking
powder and 1 tsp. salt in a measuring cup.  Add enough all-purpose
flour to equal 2 cups.
