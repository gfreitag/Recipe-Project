Title: Supermarket Bbq Sauce
Categories: Bbq/grill, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
Juice of 1/2 lemon
1 ts Ground black pepper
1/2 ts Tobasco (or more to taste)
1 c  Ketchup
2 tb Dark brown sugar
1 tb Dark molasses
Mix the ingredients. For items that take a while to cook, like
chicken, don't put the sauce on until it is almost done. If you put
it on too early, or if the fire is too hot, the sugar and molasses
will burn, and that's how you get that unpleasant charcoaly taste.
