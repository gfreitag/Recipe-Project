Categories: Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Parsley, minced
1 tb Oregano, minced or
1 ts Dried oregano
2 oz Prosciutto, cut in slivers
5    Eggs
Salt and pepper to taste
3 ds Tabasco sauce
1 c  Light cream
-or half and half
1 tb All-purpose flour
2 tb Soft butter
1/2 c  Fine bread crumbs
1 1/2 c  Cooked millet (use Method 2)
1/2 lb Green beans, cooked
-coarsely chopped
1 lb Asparagus, cooked
-coarsely chopped
2    Thin leeks, white only
-thinly sliced
1 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
Preheat oven to 350F. Line the bottom of a 2-qt. springform pan with
aluminum foil (going up 1 inch on the sides to prevent leakage).
Butter the foil evenly and sprinkle with the bread crumbs. Rotate the
pan to let the crumbs adhere to the sides and then shake out the
excess. Place the millet evenly on the bottom of the pan, then layer
each vegetable over the millet in the order given, sprinkling  cup of
the cheese and part of the parsley , oregano and prosciutto over each
layer.

Then, in a medium bowl, beat together the eggs, salt and pepper,
Tabasco, cream and flour and slowly pour the mixture over the layered
vegetables. Place the pan in another, larger pan and pour 1 inch of
boiling water into the bottom of the second pan. Bake for 50 minutes
to 1 hour, or until the center is almost set. Remove from oven and
let stand for 10 minutes to firm up the center.

Place on a serving plate and remove the sides of the springform,
leaving the base intact. Carefully turn down the edge of the aluminum
foil and cut it away with a pair of scissors, keeping the foil under
the base. Cover the edge with a ring of parsley. Blot up any
accumulated liquid on serving plate with paper towels. Serve warm or
at room temperature.
