Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Dry mustard
1 ts Cayenne -- ground

1 ts Salt
1    Egg
2 c  Vegetable oil (in all)
2 c  Basic Beef Stock
2 tb Unsalted butter

Reduce the stock in a saucepan over high heat to 1/4 cup. Set aside.
In a 1-quart saucepan melt the butter over high heat.  Add the
onions, celery, garlic and bay leaf; saute for about one minute,
stirring frequently. Stir in the white pepper, mustard and cayenne;
cook and stir about one minute. Reduce heat to medium-low and add the

In a food processor or blender, beat the egg about 30 seconds.  Add
the vegetable mixture and blend about 15 seconds.  With the machine
running, gradually add 1 1/3 cups of the oil in a thin, steady
stream, then in the same manner add the stock, then the remaining 2/3
cup oil. Blend about 30 seconds more, pushing the sides down with a
rubber spatula.

Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.
