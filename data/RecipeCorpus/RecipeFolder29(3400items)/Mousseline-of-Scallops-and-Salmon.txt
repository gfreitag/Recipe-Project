For the Mousseline: ===================

Grind the scallops and the shrimp (separately) in a meat grinder
or food processor, then cool both in the refrigerator for 1/2 hour.

Place the scallops in a bowl with 1 egg, 1 egg white (reserve
the yolk for the salmon), salt, pepper, and nutmeg.  Put the scallop
mixture in a food processor and run for 1 minute.  Slowly add cream
until blended (about 3 seconds).  Do not overblend or mixture will be
buttery.

Add truffles to scallop mixture and set aside.

Place the salmon in a processor bowl with the other egg, the
reserved egg yolk, salt and pepper.  Process for 1 minute.

Butter the ramekins or molds, then spoon the scallop mixture into
them.  Put the salmon mixture into a piping tube and pump the mixture
into the center of the mold (or simply pour mixtures into the mold.)

Place the ramekins or molds in a shallow pan containing 1 inch of
water; cover the pan with aluminum foil pierced with small holes to
allow steam to escape.  Bake in a 350 F oven for 30 minutes.

For the Sauce: ==============

Put the shallots, vinegar, and wine into small saucepan and cook
until half of the liquid is gone.

Add cream and bring to a boil, then whip.

Add butter in small pieces and whisk over medium heat.  Remove
from heat and adjust the seasonings.

For the Garnish: ================

Saute spinach and watercress in butter for 1 minute.  On hot
serving plates, arrange some of the spinach and watercress in small
circles the same size as the ramekins or molds.  Unmold the
scallop-salmon mousse onto the vegetables, top with sauce(s).

Note: You may use a combination of sauces to form a design on the
plate (American sauce, genoise sauce, tomato sauce can be used
interchangeably).
