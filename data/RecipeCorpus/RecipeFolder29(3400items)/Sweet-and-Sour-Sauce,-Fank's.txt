Title: Sweet and Sour Sauce, Fank's
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Cajun/creol, New orleans
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Cornstarch
1/4 c  Cold water
1/2 c  Water
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
1/4 c  Sugar
4 oz Plum jelly
In a heavy saucepan, mix together over medium heat the water, red wine
vinegar, and the sugar. Then, when the sugar dissolves and the mixture
comes to a SLOW BOIL, add the plum jelly and the soy sauce. Continue
to cook and stir constantly over medium heat until the jelly
dissolves and becomes smooth and the strong vinegar aroma disappears.
Then to thicken the sauce, mix the cornstarch and water together in a
small bowl, add it gradually to the scp, and cook it over medium heat
for 1 minute (or until the sauce reaches the consistency you desire).

VARIATIONS: 1) To make a peppery sweet and sour sauce, add 2
tablespoons of crushed red pepper flakes to the saucepan when you
stir in the plum jelly. 2)  To make a minty sweet and sour sauce,
follow the recipe to the letter but substitute 4 ounces of mint jelly
for the plum jelly. 3) To make yellow Chinese hot sauce, follow the
recipe to the letter but substitute undiluted frozen pineapple juice
for the jelly, eliminate the granulated sugar, and substitute white
pepper for the crushed red pepper flakes. But watch this stuff!  It
gets hot!
