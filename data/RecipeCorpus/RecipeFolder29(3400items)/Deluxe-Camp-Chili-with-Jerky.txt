Title: Deluxe Camp Chili with Jerky
Categories: Chili, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Cumin (powdered)
1/4 ts Garlic powder
Water as needed
Flour for thickening
-formatted by S.Grabowski
6 oz Jerky
3 tb Oil
1 ts Whole cumin seed
4 tb Chili powder
1 ts Onion flakes
Cut jerky into small, bite-sized pieces, remembering it will swell.
In a heavy pot, simmer jerky and cumin seeds gently in moderately hot
fat/oil for one to two minutes, stirring steadily to prevent burning.
Add chili powder and continue to stir until well mixed. (Amount of
chili powder will depend on the hotness of the jerky and your
taste.)Add onion flakes, oregano, powdered cumin, garlic powder, and
enough water to cover generously. Stir. Simmer one to two hours,
adding water as the jerky takes it up. Allow chili to cool, and
reheat before serving. If a thicker chili is prefered, add a little
flour mixed to a paste with hot liquid from the pot and cook to
desired consistency, stirring frequently. AUTHOR'S NOTE: Chances are
no salt will be needed at all, since there will probably be enough in
the jerky. FROM the Great American Chili Book
