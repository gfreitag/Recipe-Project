Title: DRIED TOMATO DRESSING
Categories: Condiments, Salads
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Dried tomatoes, 4" diameter
Vinegar, red wine
1/2 c  Olive oil
1 ts Basil, dried
1 ts Thyme, dried
1/2 ts Rosemary, dried
Start this 6-12 hours before you want to use it on a salad.

Break the dried tomato into small pieces. Put in a ceramic bowl. Pour
on just enough vinegar to barely cover the tomato pieces. Crumble the
dried herbs over the tomato pieces. Mix them in a bit. Add the oil.
Stir. Leave to marinate in the fridge, stirring occasionally until
you are ready to dress the salad.

We put this on a romaine lettuce salad. The salad also had anise
slices, and orange pieces. I don't think we put any onion in, but I
was a bit tipsy on my friends' homemade wine when I was putting
together the salad so can't remember what all went in it. It was a
fairly simple green salad though. No celery or carrots or green
peppers in it.

This recipe for dressing got rave reviews from my friends and will be
the recipe I include with the dried tomatoes I made for Christmas
gifts this year.
