2 1/2 pt Warm water to mix

FOR SMALL QUANTITY
2 tb Flour
2 tb Oatmeal
1 ts Baking powder
Water to mix
Mix the oatmeal, flour and salt in a warm bowl. Cream the yeast with
the sugar and add 1/2 pint of the warm water. Pour the yeast mixture
into the dry ingredients and add the rest of the water, mixing slowly
until a thin batter is formed. Set aside in a warm place until well
risen, about 30 minutes. Grease a large frying pan and heat. Pour
cupfuls of the batter on to the hot pan and cook like thick pancakes
for 4-5 minutes on each side. The oatcakes will keep for 2-3 days.
Serve warmed up in a frying pan with bacon and eggs or with lemon
juice and sugar or toasted with cheese or golden syrup. To make a
small quantity mix the flour, oatmeal and the salt with the water to
form a thin batter and add the baking powder just before cooking.
