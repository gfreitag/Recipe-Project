MMMMM----------------------------1 LB---------------------------------
1/2 c  Water (for Welbilt machine
Add 1 tb more water)
1    Egg

1 ts Salt
2 tb Melted butter
1 tb Sugar
2 ts Gluten
2 tb Dry milk powder
1 1/2 ts Red Star Active Dry Yeast
2 tb Melted butter for topping
For my Hitachi:  Have all ingredients at room temperature. I
microwave the water and butter for approx. 50 sec on high, then stir
in the egg to warm it as well.

Place ingredients in machine in order suggested by manufacturer.
Select dough cycle.  At end of dough cycle, remove dough and turn out
onto a lightly floured board (or counter top) Cover with cloth and
let rest 10 minutes.

For 1 1/2 loaf, divide into 16 pieces of dough. For 1 lb loaf, divide
into 12 pieces of dough.  Form each piece into a ball and place in a
9x13 pan for large recipe, or 9 inch square or round pan for the
smaller recipe.

Hint:  On a cool day you can preheat oven at 140 for 1 mins, turn
oven off. Place covered rolls in oven and let rise until doubled (30
to 45 minutes)

After dough has doubled, remove pan from oven keep covered and then
preheat the oven to 400.

Brush rolls with melted butter:  Bake 15 - 17 minutes or until golden
brown.  Remove and cool on rack.
