1/4 c  Hazelnuts
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/4 ts Lemon juice
MMMMM-------------------DOUBLE MOCHA ICE CREAM------------------------
8 oz Semi-sweet chocolate;
-broken into 1/2 oz pcs
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate;
-broken into 1/2 oz pc
1/4 c  Brewed coffee; full strength
2 tb Instant espresso powder
2 c  Heavy cream
1 c  Half-and-half
1 c  Granulated sugar
5    Egg yolks
EQUIPMENT: 2 baking sheets with sides, 2 large 100%-cotton towels,
food processor with metal blade, 2 2 1/2-qt saucepans, metal spoon, 2
2-quart plastic containers with lids, double boiler, electric mixer
fitted with a paddle, rubber spatula, 2 stainless steel bowls (1
large), instant-read test thermometer, ice-cream freezer

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast and skin the hazelnuts, then
allow the nuts to cool to room temperature. In the bowl of a food
processor fitted with a metal blade, chop the hazelnuts into pieces
1/8 inch in size. Spread the chopped hazelnuts onto a baking sheet
with sides.

Combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar and the lemon juice in a 2 1/2-qt
saucepan. Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist
sand). Caramelize the sugar for 4 1/2 to 5 minutes over medium-high
heat, stirring constantly with a whisk to break up any lumps (the
sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then light brown as it
caramelizes). Pour the caramelized sugar over the chopped hazelnuts.
Stir the mixture with a spoon, then spread it into an uneven mass,
about 4 to 5 inches in diameter. Allow the pralines to cool to room
temperature. Break the pralines into uneven pieces, then place in the
bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Chop the pralines
into 1/8-inch pieces. Transfer the chopped pralines to a plastic
container with a lid. Freeze until needed. Makes 1 1/2 quarts
