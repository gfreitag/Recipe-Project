1 c  Dark rum
3/4 c  Water plus 1 teaspoon

2 tb Shortening

My Grandmother's recipe calls for greasing a 10 in tube pan. I use a
12-cup bundt pan with excellent results. 1.Combine cake mix, pudding
mix, eggs, 1/2 c of the rum, 3/4 c of the water and the oil in a
large mixing bowl. Beat at low speed until ingrediants are moistened.
Then two minutes at medium speed. Stir in 1 cup of the chocolate
chips. Pout batter into prepared pan. Bake 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in
pan 15 minutes. Remove from pan, finish cooling on a wire rack. 2.In
a small saucepan, heat preserves and remaining 1/2 c rum to make
glaze. Strain through sieve to remove seeds. Place cake on serving
plate. Prick the surface of the cake with a fork, or a tooth pick. (I
use this time to vent frustations) Brush the raspberry glaze evenly
over the cake. Use all the glaze. It does take a few minutes to do
this. Just make sure its evenly applied. 3.In a bowl, combine
remaining 1 c of chocolate chips and shortening. Microwave on high 1
minute. (I know, my Grandma never had a Microwave, I just updated the
recipe, because in this case the technology makes this process
painless and quick, and I'm less likely to burn the chocolate.) Stir
to make a smooth icing. Drizzle chocolate icing over the cake. Let
stand about 15 minutes. 4.In a small bowl, combine vanilla baking bar
and remaining 1 teaspoon of water. Microwave on high 30 seconds (or
until melted). Drizzle vanilla icing over the chocolate icing.
Grandma always served this tasty morsel with very strong coffee.
