The night before, put the steaks in a dish in single layers. Wipe
them on both sides with an even coating of corn oil. Dust them on
both sides with a generous amount of season salt. Drizzle each steak
with wine or juice. Seal the dish in doubled foil or plastic wrap and
refrigerate it for about 24 hours prior to preparing the final dish.
Remove the steaks from the fridge and coat both sides well in the
bisquit mix. Combine the butter with the oil in a large skillet until
melted. Brown both sides of each steak, till crispy. Transfer right
back to the same  baking dish and seal in foil. Bake at 375~ about 30
