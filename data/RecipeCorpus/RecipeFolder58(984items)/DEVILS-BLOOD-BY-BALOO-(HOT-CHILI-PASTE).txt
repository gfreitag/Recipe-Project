Title: DEVILS BLOOD BY BALOO (HOT CHILI PASTE)
Categories: Spice paste, Chili, Baloo
Yield: 35 Centiliter
400 g  Red chilis such as cayenne
-or Spanish pepper
15 ml Honey
15 ml "Liquid Smoke"
25 ml Cognac
For this recipe I use fresh red chiles (sold as "Spanish Peppers" in
Sweden). Roast the chiles until the skin start to blacken. Let them
cool. Skin and seed the chiles. Mix chiles, honey, cognac and salt in
a food processor on high speed until you get a smooth paste. Boil the
paste 5 minutes and fill it in small glass jars. Will keep for many
months in the refrigerator. This makes a very hot chili paste. Use it
with care.
