The pie -- optional
Peel, halve and core the apples. Cut each half into 5 or 6 wedges.
Melt the butter in a wide, shallow, slopingsided pan over medium
heat. When the butter begins to sizzle, add the sliced apples and
cook, tossing or gently stirring, until they begin to sizzle about a
minute. Add the lemon juice and sugar and continue to toss or gently
stir often until the apples are tender, but still fairly firm about 5
minutes longer. If the appleshave exuded a large quantity of juice,
they will reabsorb it as they cool. Pour the filling out into a
nonreactive pan, or a pan lined with plastic wrap, on which the apple
slices will fit in a single layer. Sprinkle with the cinnamon and let
cool. Set a rack at the upper and lower thirds of the oven and
preheat to 400 degrees. Roll out the bottom crust and arrange in pan.
Pour the cooled filling into the bottom crust. Roll out the top crust
for double crust pie. Cut several slashes in the top crust and
carefully brush with egg wash. Be careful not to leave puddles of
liquid on the crust. If you wish, sprinkle the top crust with sugar.
Place the pie in the oven on the lower rack and lower the temperature
to 375 degrees. Bake the pie for about 40 minutes, until the crust is
baked through and a deep golden brown and the filling is gently
bubbling. If the top crust has not colored sufficiently after 30
minutes, move the pie to the upper rack of the oven for the last 10
minutes. Cool the pie on a rack. Yield: One 9inch pie
