1    1663 recipe
Take a pint of cream and strain 4 eggs into it, and put in a little
salt and a little slice nutmeg. Season it with sugar somewhat sweet;
then take a penny loaf of fine white bread sliced very thin, and put
it in a dish that will hold it, the cream and the eggs being put to
it; then take a handful of raisins of the sun being boiled, and a
little sweet butter, so bake it. From: The Margaret Rudkin Pepperidge
