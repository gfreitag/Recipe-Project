Title: DESSERT CORNBREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Cornmeal (yellow or white)
1    Egg
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 c  Honey or molasses
1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
1/4 c  Oil
2 ts Baking powder
3 c  Milk
1/2 ts Salt.
Combine dry ingredients.  Combine wet ingred.  Mix together.

Mixture will be quite watery.  Pour into greased pan or dish (8" x
8", or something similar).  Bake for 30 min. at 325 degrees, or until
top is springy when gently touched. Serve hot in a bowl or dish. The
center will be somewhat like custard, so you might not wish to eat it
in your hand like you would a piece of bread.

It may be served with honey, jam, or milk, or plain. Yuummmmy.
