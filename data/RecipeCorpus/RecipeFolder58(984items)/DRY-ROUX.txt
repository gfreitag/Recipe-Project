Title: DRY ROUX
Categories: Cajun
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Information
The traditional roux is an important element of many Cajun and Creole
dishes.  It is a mixture of half flour and half fat (oil or butter)
cooked to progressive degrees of color from blond to brown depending
on the richness and the "smokiness" of the flavor you are trying to
achieve, the brown being the richest. This typical ingredient is a
problem to low-fat, low-calorie, low-cholesterol cookery because of
its high oil content, but making a "roux" without the oil is simple.

For use in Cajun dishes, gravies and as an all around flavorful
thickening agent.

Make several cups at a time and store in tightly closed jar in
refrigerator.

Put 1 to 3 cups flour into heavy skillet and place over moderate
heat. The amount of flour depends only on size of skillet and size of
storage container you will use.

Stir the flour around often with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Pay
attention to the cooking because the flour will take a few minutes (5
or so) to begin coloring. Stir constantly to keep the flour in the
bottom of the skillet moving so that it does not burn. Continue until
all the flour is desired color, probably about like a light peanut
butter color. The entire process takes 15 to 20 minutes to get enough
rich dry roux to use for many dishes. Most dishes will call for
several tablespoons full. Later -- when the dry roux is mixed with
liquid, it will take on a darker color.
