Title: DELICE AUX NOISETTES
Categories: Desserts, Nuts, Kump
Yield: 6 Servings
1    10-in prebaked quiche shell
1 1/2 c  Hazelnuts
1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
1 pn Cream of tartar
1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Confectioners' sugar
1/2 tb Vanilla
2 lg Eggs
PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Whip 1/2 cup of the cream in a chilled bowl or
over ice till soft peaks form, then add the confectioners' sugar and
vanilla and beat just to stiff peaks. Place in strainer lined with
cheesecloth and set over a bowl. Place the hazelnuts on a tray in the
oven for about 10 minutes. Do not let them burn. Take them out and
skin them. Keep 1/2 cup of the nuts warm. In a stainless steel or
aluminum saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of the sugar and 3 tablespoons of
water to boiling. Add a pinch of cream of tartar and continue cooking
to a light brown color. Lightly oil a baking sheet with 1 to 2
tablespoons of oil. When the syrup is a light brown, pour the 1/2 cup
of warmed nuts into it and stir with a wooden spoon to coat the nuts
evenly. Immediately pour them out onto the oiled baking sheet. Let
cool, 10 minutes, to make nougatine. Grind the remaining 1 cup nuts
with 3/4 cup of the sugar in a food processor to form nut butter.
This will take from 6 to 10 minutes. The food processor may have to
be scraped down from time to time, but the oils must emerge and it
must be somewhat like a peanut butter. When the nougatine is cooled
and hardened, chop it coarsely with a knife into pieces small enough
to eat. Mix 1 cup of cream and the eggs together, add to nut butter
and pour into a quiche shell. Sprinkle the nougatine over the top.
Bake 25 to 35 minutes until browned and set. Serve the quiche tepid
with dollops of whipped cream placed on the top with a tablespoon. Or
decorate with whipped cream piped through a pastry bag.
