Title: DOUBLE CHOCOLATE PUDDING
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
1 c  Minus 2 Tb. sugar
1 2/3 c  Milk
1/8 ts Salt
3 tb Cornstarch
3 tb Unsweetened cocoa
1/3 c  Cold milk
2 tb Cold unsalted butter
1/2 ts Vanilla
Whipped cream
Chop or grate chocolate, and melt chocolate in the top of a double
boiler over gently boiling water.  (The water should just barely
touch the bottom of the upper pot.) Slowly stir in the sugar, 1 2/3
c. milk, and salt. Heat, stirring, until chocolate is melted and
mixture is blended.

While mixture heats, sift cornstarch and cocoa together and stir into
1/3 c. milk until dissolved. Stir slowly into hot chocolate milk.
Keep stirring constantly and gently for 7 or 9 minutes, or until
pudding thickens and almost mounds.  Cover and cook, without
stirring, for about 10 minutes.

Remove top of double boiler from heat and gently stir in butter, cut
into small pieces.  (If you use salted butter, eliminate salt from
recipe.) Cool slightly for 5 to 7 minutes, then very gently stir in
vanilla. Pour into individual cups or a single bowl.  Cover with wax
paper to prevent skin from forming.  Cool; chill a few hours. Serve
with whipped cream.
