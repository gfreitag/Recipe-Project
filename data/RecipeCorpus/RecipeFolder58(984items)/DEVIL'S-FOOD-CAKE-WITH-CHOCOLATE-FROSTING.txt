Categories: Cakes, Low-fat
Yield: 12 Servings
Nonstick spray coating
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 3/4 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
1 1/2 c  Skim milk
1/2 c  Margarine, softened
1 ts Vanilla
2    Egg whites
1/4 c  Sugar
Spray two 9 x 1 1/2" round baking pans with nonstick coating and dust
lightly with flour; set pans aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine
flour, 1 1/4 cups sugar, cocoa powder, and baking soda. Add milk,
margarine and vanilla.  Beat with an electric mixer on low speed
about 30 seconds or until combined.  Beat on medium to high speed for
2 minutes, scraping sides of the bowl occasionally. Thoroughly wash
the beaters. In a small mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until soft
peaks form (tips curl). Gradually add the 1/4 cup sugar, beating
until stiff peaks form (tips stand straight). Fold into the batter.
Pour the batter into the prepared pans. Bake in a 350F oven for 25-30
minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted near the center comes
out clean.  Cool cakes in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Remove
cakes from pans and cool them thoroughly on wire racks. Spread the
Chocolate Frosting between the layers, then frost sides and top.
CHOCOLATE FROSTING: In a medium mixing bowl, beat 2 tablespoons
margarine and 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder until margarine is
softened. Gradually add 1 1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar, beating
well.  Slowly beat in 3 tablespoons skim milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla.
Slowly beat in 1 1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar and additional skim
milk, if needed, to make of spreading consistency.  Makes 1 cup.
