flour, salt, and paprika. Coat the chicken with the flour, shaking
off the excess. Reserve the flour mixture.

heat. Add the chicken, meaty side down, and cook for 1 1/2 minutes on
each side or until well browned. Remove to a plate with a slotted
spoon.

3.  Pour the broth into the flour mixture remaining in the bowl and
whisk until smooth.

4.  Drain the fat from the skillet and wipe it clean. Add the chicken
broth mixture and 2 tablespoons of the dill. Stir to mix. Add the
chicken meaty side up, and the potatoes. Bring to a boil over high
heat. Reduce the heat to low.  Cover and simmer for 10 minutes.

5.  Lay the asparagus over the top.  Cover and simmer for 15 to 20
minutes more, or until the chicken and vegetables are tender.

6.  Remove the pan from the heat.  Stir in the lemon juice and the
remaining 2 tablespoons of dill.
