Title: DEER SAUSAGE PEPPERONI
Categories: Wildgame, Venison
Yield: 1 servings
5 lb Deer, ground
5 lb Pork butt, ground
1 lb Pork fat, ground
2 1/2 oz Sausage seasoning
SEASONING:  I use a commercially prepared sausage seasoning such as
Dan-Dee Seasoning Metairie Louisiana

Mix ground meats with seasoning and form into patties 3" in diameter,
3/8 " to 1/2 " thick. Place patties on squares of waxed paper, four
high, and place six squares in a plastic Ziploc bag and freeze.
Recipe makes 78 patties when 5-5-1 pounds of meat used.

IMPROVE by using smoked sow belly (Kroger, bacon department) instead
of fat pork, This gives smoked flavor to sausage.  Makes a very lean
sausage which needs water to cook.
