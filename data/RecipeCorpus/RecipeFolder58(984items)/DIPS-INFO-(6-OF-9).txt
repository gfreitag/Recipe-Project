********** To withstand the test of dipping,
breads must be firm enough in texture to successfully transport the
dip from the bowl to the mouth.
Chunks of coarser breads, such as French, Italian, and some ryes work
well, as do toasted or dried breads. Pita bread cut into triangles and
toasted is a tasty and versatile dipper. The following recipes, Herbed
Croutons and Bread Sticks, are good for dipping.
HERBED CROUTONS: Using 4 cups of crustless bread that is fresh or
one day old, cut into 2-inch squares or tear into chunks. (You can
also use cornbread.)  Gently toss the bread chunks with 1 cup of
melted butter or regular margarine which has been laced with the herb
suggestions below. Place on a cookie sheet and toast in a 400 degree
F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes if a soft center is desired or for 20 to
25 minutes for crunchier croutons.
Makes enough for about 2 1/2 cups of dip.
HERB COMBINATIONS FOR THE ABOVE RECIPE: Variation 1: 2 Tbls Dried
Tarragon
Onion Powder Variation 2: 2 Cloves Crushed
1/2    Tsp
Garlic (Use a
Press)
Salt Variation 3: 1 Clove Crushed Garlic
Dried Basil
1/4    Tsp
1    Tbls
Grated Parmesan Cheese
for garnish. (Sprinkle
over the croutons just
before toasting.) Variation 4: 2
Tbls Italian Seasoning Variation 5: 2 Tbls Minced Onion
Salt BREAD STICKS: Melt 1/4 cup of butter or
1/4    Tsp
regular margarine and mix with 1/4 tsp garlic powder. Prepare frozen
soft bread sticks according to the directions on the package but
brush with the garlic butter before baking.  When done, let cool for
about 2 hours. Cut each bread stick into 4 equal pieces. Place on an
ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 225 degrees F. for 30 minutes or
until the bread sticks are dry and crisp.
One package of frozen bread sticks makes enough for about 2 1/2 cups
of dip.
