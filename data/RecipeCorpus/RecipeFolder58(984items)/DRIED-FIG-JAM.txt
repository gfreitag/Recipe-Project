Categories: Canning, Fruits, Harned 1994, Jams, Preserves
Yield: 1 Batch
28 oz Dried figs (used both
-homemade and commercial)
5 c  ;Water
1/2 c  Fresh lemon juice
3 c  Sugar
Seeds from juiced lemons
1 ts Ground cardamom
1 tb Dark rum
Place figs in 4 qt pot.  Add all water, cover pot, bring to a boil and
remove pot from heat.  Let the pot of figs sit for at least an hour to
plump them. Remove figs from the dark water with a slotted spoon.
Reserve the water. Cut stems off figs with scissors and chop figs
medium coarse by hand or in a processor. Add lemon juice and sugar to
the fig water. Set water to a second boil, then reduce heat and let
simmer for 5-10 minutes. Tie up seeds into a cheesecloth bundle and
drop in fig water. Drop the chopped figs into the fig water. Bring
fig jam to another boil, then let simmer for 15-20 minutes.  Jam
should be slightly thickened. Remove from heat. Take out the
cheesecloth bag. Stir in the rum and cardamom well. Ladle into 1 pint
jars (1/2 pint works, too), leaving 1/4" headspace. Seal jars
according to manufacturer's instructions. Process jars for 15 minutes
in a boiling water bath. Yield: About 4 pints.
