Title: DILL DRESSING
Categories: Seasonings, Sauces
Yield: 1 Cup
1 1/2 tb Dijon-style mustard
3 tb White wine or herb vinegar
1/3 c  Olive oil
1/3 c  Chopped dill
1/4 c  Chopped chives
Chopped tarragon leaves
-- (from 3-4 sprigs)
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
"I offer this dressing as an example of how well dill combines with
other herbs and how many foods it can complement. Try it with carrot
and cabbage slaw, with green salad, beet salad, and composed salads
containing raw fennel or steamed asparagus or cauliflower. It makes a
delicious and different dipping sauce for steamed artichokes and
gives new interest and flavor to chicken, fish, and meat salads ~-
it's surprisingly tasty with canned tuna.  You may substitute chervil
or basil for the tarragon and garlic chives for the chives.  Using an
herb vinegar containing the chosen herb heightens the flavor."  --

DIRECTIONS: =========== Mix the mustard with the vinegar in a bowl.
Whisk in the olive oil, then stir in the dill, chives, and tarragon.
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add a little more vinegar or
oil if you like.
