Categories: Casseroles
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM-----------------------TURKEY MIXTURE----------------------------
2 1/4 c  Chicken broth, defatted
1/2 c  Chopped celery
1/4 c  Chopped onions
2 md Carrots, coarsely chopped
3 tb Cornstarch
1 3/4 c  Evaporated skim milk
3 c  Cooked, chopped turkey
-breast
1 c  Frozen peas, thawed
1/4 c  Snipped fresh parsley
1/2 ts Dried sage
MMMMM------------------------PASTRY CRUST-----------------------------
3    Sheets phyllo dough
To Make the Turkey Mixture:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a
medium saucepan, combine 2 cups of the broth, the celery, onions and
carrots. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Cover and simmer
about 5 minutes or until the veggies are tender.  In a custard cup,
stir the remaining 1/4 cup of the broth and the cornstarch until
smooth. Slowly stir this into the broth-veggie mxiture.  Then stir in
the milk. Cook and stir over medium heat until the mixture comes to a
boil. Reuce the heat. Cook and stir for 1 minute more. Then stir in
the turkey, peas, parsely and sage. Transfer the mixture to a shallow
2-quart casserole.

To Make the Pastry Crust:  Lay one sheet of the phyllo dough on top
of the turkey mixture.  Spray the dough with no stick spray. Repeat
layering and spraying the phyllo dough two more times. Fold or
crumple the edges of the dough and tuck them inside the casserole
dish. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown.

I added potatoes, mixed veggies, tobasco sauce and some liquid smoke
to enhance the flavor.  Very good and light. Even though the phyllo
dough crust will get soft once you refrigerate it, it will get flaky
again if you reheat it in the oven.
