MMMMM---------------------FOR SMALL QUANTITY--------------------------
2 tb Flour

Water to mix
* If you can't get fine oatmeal, use Quaker oats and grind fine in a
food processer. Mix oatmeal, flour and salt in a warm bowl. Cream
yeast with sugar and add 1/2 pint of the warm water. Pour the yeast
mixture into the dry ingredients and add the rest of the water,
mixing slowly until a thin batter is formed. Set aside in a warm
place until well risen, about 30 mins. Grease a large frying pan
heat. Pour cupfuls of the batter onto the pan and cook like thick
pancakes for 4 - 5 mins on each side. Serve warmed up in a frying pan
with bacon and eggs or with lemon juice and sugar, or toasted with
cheese or golden syrup. To make a small quantity mix the flour,
oatmeal and salt with the water to form a thin batter, and add the
baking powder just before cooking. The oatcakes will keep for 2 - 3
days, or for 3 months if frozen.
