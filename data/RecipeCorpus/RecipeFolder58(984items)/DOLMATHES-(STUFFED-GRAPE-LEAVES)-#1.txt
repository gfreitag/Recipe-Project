Yield: 30 To 40
MMMMM-----------------------JUDI M. PHELPS----------------------------
30    To 40 grape leaves *
1/2 c  Olive oil
1 md Onion; finely chopped
1/2 c  Raw long-grain rice
1/4 c  Pine nuts
3 tb Tomato paste
Juice of 1 lemon
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Salt
3/4 c  ;boiling water
Lemon wedges; for garnish
*These leaves are packed in jars in brine.

Rinse grape leaves in warm water and drain in a colander. In a medium
saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over moderate heat. Add onion
and saute until limp. Add rice and pine nuts and saute, stirring 3-4
minutes.

Add tomato paste, lemon juice, cinnamon, salt, and boiling water.
Cover and cook over low heat for 15-20 minutes or until rice is
tender and all liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and let stand
covered for one hour.

Placing a grape leaf right side up in front of you, place a heaping
teaspoon of filling in a horizontal line along the middle of the
leaf. Roll stem end of leaf up over filling, then fold in sides, then
fold over top. Squeeze the stuffed rolled grape leaf gently in your
hand; this will help keep it closed.  Continue stuffing grape leaves
until all the filling is used.

Pour 2 tablespoons olive oil in the bottom of a lage shallow pot or
frying pan.  Place the stuffed grape leaves close together in a
single layer in the pot. Pour over remaining 1/4 cup olive oil. Place
a large heavy plate or flat casserole cover over the grape leaves to
keep them from unfolding while they cook. Cover the pot and cook over
very low heat for one hour. Let cool with plate on top of them.
Remove from pan and refrigerate. (These are best made a day or two or
up to a week ahead.) Bring to room temperature before serving. Serve
garnished with lemon wedges.
