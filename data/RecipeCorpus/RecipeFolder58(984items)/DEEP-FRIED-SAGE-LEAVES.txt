Enright says that Chef Willy Brand, of Toronto's George Brown College,
first tasted these when he worked in Switzerland, where the sage
leaves were popular at cocktail parties. She also says that these are
good served with selected cheeses, or with deep-fried wedges of
camembert or brie and a tomato dipping sauce.
