Categories: Pets
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Beef, chicken, or vegetable
-stock
1 c  Bread or all-purpose flour
1 c  Whole wheat or rye (or other
-dark) flour
1 c  Bulgar wheat
1/4 c  Non-fat dry milk powder

Use dough cycle. Roll dough to 1/4" thickness. Cut with cookie
cutters or knife. Place on baking sheets sprinkled with cornmeal.
Cover with clean kitchen towels and let rise in warm place about 45
minutes. Bake at 325-degrees for 45 minutes. When all are baked, turn
off oven and return all cookies to cooling oven overnight to harden.
Store in airtight container.

(Using a 3.5" bone shaped cutter, I get about 30-35 cookies from this
recipe. Sam the Wonder Dog adores them.)
