Title: DELICATE WHOLE-WHEAT PASTA
Categories: Breads
Yield: 8 Servings
1 c  Flour, whole-wheat pastry
1 ts Salt
1 c  Flour, unbleached
2    Eggs
2 ts Olive oil
2 tb Water; (more as needed)
Sift flours and salt together into a large mixing bowl or food
processor. Add the eggs and oil, and work together until you have a
moderately sticky lump (if working by hand) or a grainy mixture (if
working with a food processor). Add 2 T. water, and work the dough
until you have a fairly firm lump. Add a little more water or flour
as needed to get a good-feeling texture. If working by hand, don't
try to reincorporate the flakes that fall off the main lump. Knead
the dough gently for 5 minutes, wrap in a damp dish towel, and let it
rest 30 minutes to an hour. Divide the dough into 8 parts and roll
out very thin with a rolling pin or pasta roller. It will thicken and
shrink a bit after the rolling, so roll a little thinner than you
want it to end up. Makes 24 lasagne noodles, or enough
spaghetti/fettucine for 8.
