This is one of my favorites.  Deep fried tofu with a peanut sauce for
dipping.  This one calls for pressing the tofu first. It makes it
denser.

1:  Wrap tofu in 3 sheets of absorbent paper, weigh down with plate;
let stand for 4 hours.

2:  Just before serving, cut tofu into 2cm cubes. Deep fry cubes in
hot oil in batches until well browned; drain on absorbent paper.
Serve hot with warm peanut sauce.

3:  Peanut Sauce:  Combine coriander root, chilli, garlic, sugar and
vinegar in pan, stir over heat until sugar is dissolved. Stir in
peanut buffer and coconut milk, stir until heated through. Serve
sprinkled with fresh coriander and chilli, if desired.

Makes 6 servings.

Sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Storage: Covered, in refrigerator.
Freeze: Not suitable. Microwave: Sauce suitable.
