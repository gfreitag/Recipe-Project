Yield: 8 Servings
Panache
1    Yellow bell pepper --

2 c  Jicama -- julienned
1 c  Yellow onion -- sliced thin
1    Jalapeno -- finely chopped
4    Limes
1    Orange

1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
Cayenne to taste
Oil for deep frying

1    Avocado -- sliced
Cilantro
Make the panache the day before serving. Mix the pepper, jicama,
onions, and chili in a bowl. Squeeze the juice from the limes and
orange and pour over the vegetables. Toss with a little salt and
allow to marinate overnight, stirring occasionally. To make the crab
balls, mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. Toss with your
hands, breaking up the pasta slightly and making sure the ingredients
are well mixed. Form into 35 balls about the size of a walnut and fry
in 350F fat until golden brown.

Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, and
keep warm in a 150F oven while completing the frying process. To
serve, place 4 to 6 crab balls on each plate with some of the panache
next to them. Garnish with 2 avocado slices and a few sprigs of
cilantro. Note: The crab mixture can be made the day before serving
and kept refrigerated, tightly covered with plastic wrap. If the
balls are fried in advance, or if there are leftovers, reheat them in
a 400F oven for a few minutes to crisp.
