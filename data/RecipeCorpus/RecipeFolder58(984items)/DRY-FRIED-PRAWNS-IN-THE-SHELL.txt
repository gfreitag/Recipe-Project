The trick to eating these is to pop them into your mouth and then
separate the shells from the meat with your teeth and tongue. If the
shells are crispy enough, eat 'em shells and all. The sauce cooks
into the shells making them very flavorful.

Leave shells and legs on the prawns. Rinse in cold water. Pat
completely dry with paper toweling.

To devein prawns, cut a 1/4-inch deep by 1/2-inch long incision down
the outside curve of each shell. (Pointed kitchen shears are useful
for this job.) Grasp the black vein and gently pull out and discard.

Preheat a wok or skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the oil,
salt, ginger and garlic.

Crush the ginger and garlic against the side of the pan with the back
of the spatula to squeeze out their juices (about 30 seconds); remove
ginger and garlic and discard.

When the oil is hot but not smoking, place a single layer of prawns
flat in the pan. Fry without stirring until browned and crusty, about
1 minute. Turn the prawns and fry without stirring until browned on
the second side, about 1 minute. Remove and keep warm while frying
remaining prawns.

When the last batch is done, increase heat to high. Return all the
prawns to the pan, along with the green onions, pepper, sugar, wine
and soy sauce. Quickly toss over high heat until liquid is reduced
and a glaze coats the shrimp, about 30 seconds. Serve on a bed of
watercress.
