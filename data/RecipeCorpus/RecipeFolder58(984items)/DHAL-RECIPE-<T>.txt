Saute in water or broth the onion, garlic and spices. Add the
lentils, hot water and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and
simmer until lentils are tender, about 45 minutes. Remove cover and
simmer over very low heat, stirring frequently, about 20 more
minutes, until lentils are mushy and thick, about the consistency of
refried beans. Garnish with onions, thinly sliced and browned, or a
squeeze of lemon. Serve with rice.
