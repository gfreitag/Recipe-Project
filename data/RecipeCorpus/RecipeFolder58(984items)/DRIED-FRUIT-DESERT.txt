2 c  dried apricots -- washed
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  drambuie
1 c  whipped cream

1. Place dried fruit and drambuie into a small, deep, heavy-bottomed
saucepan and gently heat. Simmer for 5 min, but do not boil. Be very
careful of flames, as drambuie may ignite. 2. Remove from heat and
place in sterile perserve jar. Let cool then cover and refigerate. 3.
Keep fruit for at least one week. (Fruit should keep for up to a
month.)

To serve, place chilled fruit and juice into shallow glass desert
bowls and top with fresh whipped cream. (You may flavor the cream
with a slight shot of dranbuie.)
