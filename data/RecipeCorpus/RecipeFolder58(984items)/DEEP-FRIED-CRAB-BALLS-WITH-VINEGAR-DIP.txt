2 tb Dry sherry
1 ts Salt

You can serve this dish hot or cold.  We prefer the crab balls hot,
when their exterior is crisp and the meat hot and moist. They also go
better with the vinegar dip when hot. If you prefer to serve them
cold or at room temperature, delete the dip, or substitute something
like mustard and catsup.

Preparation: If you're using food processor, crab and pork fat should
be cold.  Cut pork fat into cubes. Trim and cut scallion into 1"
sections, including greens. Using steel blade, place water chestnuts
and scallion in bowl; pulse/start to chop vegetables.  Add crab meat
and pork fat; pulse/start to mince.  Add eggs, sherry, salt, corn-
starch and minced ginger. Pulse/start 3 or 4 times to blend. Don't
overdo it; you don't want a puree.

Deep-frying: In wok or deep-fryer, heat oil until bubbles form around
a bamboo chopstick held upright in oil. Using teaspoon, form small
ball of crab mixture. Test cooking temperature; it should brown and
cook through in about 5 minutes; adjust heat if necessary. Proceed
with deep-frying about 6 balls at a time; avoid crowding them. Drain
on bamboo strainer or towel. If you can't serve them immediately,
refry briefly to crisp skin. Avoid overcooking.

Vinegar dip:  Mix ingredients in a shallow bowl; place on serving
platter and surround with crab balls.
