Title: DRUNKEN FISH B1
Categories: Fish, Chinese, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 oz Black fungi
1    (2-lb) sea bass or
1/2 lb Sole fillet
2 tb Cornstarch
1    Egg white
- (1/2 egg white if
- sole fillet is used)
1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Sugar
3 tb Pale dry sherry
1 1/2 c  Soya bean oil
The day before, soak black fungi as in With Three recipe (see index).
Skin the sea bass fillets under cold running water and pat dry with
absorbent paper towels. Using a cleaver or sharp knife, cut the
fillets into pieces 2 inches square by 1/2-inch thick. Place 1
tablespoon of cornstarch and the egg white in a bowl and add the sea
bass pieces. Toss lightly until each piece is coated. Combine chicken
stock, salt, sugar, and sherry in another bowl. Heat the soya bean
oil in a wok to 315 F to 320 F. Lay the coated sea bass pieces
carefully in the hot oil. Fry for 2 minutes, making sure that the
pieces do not stick together. Remove pieces and rest on a dish to
drain. Pour out remaining oil, leaving only enough to lightly coat
the wok's surface. Add chicken stock mixture to wok along with the
drained sea bass pieces. Bring to a boil and add 1 tablespoon
cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon of water. Return to a boil and
pour over the black fungi bed previously prepared. Serve.
