Title: DIABETIC PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES
Categories: Diabetic, Desserts, Cookies, Exchanges
Yield: 24 Servings
1/2 c  Peanut butter
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 c  Brown sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 lg Egg
1 1/2 c  Whole-wheat flour (or less)
2 ts Baking soda
My note:  tested using 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour. YUM! These are
large cookies, 2 tsp sugar per cookie.

Preheat oven to 350 F.

Cream together the peanut butter and vegetable oil in a bowl. Add
brown sugar, vanilla, and egg.  Beat well.

Add flour (reserve 1/4 - 1/2 cup) and baking soda. Blend thoroughly.
Add enough extra flour so that you can shape dough into balls and
place on an ungreased baking sheet. Can be made as 36 medium (my
choice) or
48    small cookies.

Flatten with a fork, bake about 10 - 15 minutes or until lightly
browned.
