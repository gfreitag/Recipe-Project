Categories: Desserts, Fruits
Yield: 8 Servings
FILLING:
6 lg Spy apples
1 lg Bartlett pear
1/2 c  Dried apricots
2 ts Lemon juice
1/3 c  Granulated sugar
2 tb Cornstarch
1 ts Cinnamon
Pinch nutmeg
PASTRY:
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
Pinch salt
1/3 c  Lard or unsalted butter,cold
-cut into bits
1/4 c  Unsalted butter, cold, cut
-into bits
1    Egg
1/4 c  Water, cold
Preheat the oven to 400Ã¸F.

To make the filling, peel, core and slice the apples and pear. Chop
the apricots coarsely (scissors work well).

Mix the fruits together and then toss with the lemon juice, sugar,
cornstarch, cinnamon and nutmeg. Arrange in a 13 x 9 inch casserole or
baking dish (approximately 3 inches deep).

To make the pastry, combine the flour with the salt. Cut in the lard
and butter until they are in tiny pieces. Beat the egg with the water
and sprinkle enough over the pastry so that you can gather the dough
into a ball.  Reserve the remaining egg mixture. Roll out the dough
to fit the top of the baking dish. Fit the pastry over the fruit
mixture. Brush the top with remaining egg wash and prick the dough
with a fork.

Bake for 50 to 60 minutes.  If the top browns too much, reduce the
heat for the last 20 minutes of the baking time. Serve warm. Yield:
12 servings. Typed in MMFormat by cjhartlin@msn.com Source: Cooking
