To form the medallions, place two deboned fillets flat on the table
and back to back.  Roll from the narrower belly end and secure with
toothpicks, forming a salmon roll. Slice the roll into 1 inch thick
medallions. Combine dill, lemon peel, pepper and salt and sprinkle
over the medallions. Place on a greased rack over the liquid,
steaming for 10 minutes.

In a small bowl, blend the butter and dill together. Spoon butter onto
plastic wrap and shape into a roll. Refrigerate until firm.

Slice zucchini into thin pieces, removing any seeds. Saute lightly in
butter.

Remove the medallions from the steamer and place on a serving platter
covered with fresh spinach.  Surround with the sliced zucchini and
top with dill butter.

Serves 4.
