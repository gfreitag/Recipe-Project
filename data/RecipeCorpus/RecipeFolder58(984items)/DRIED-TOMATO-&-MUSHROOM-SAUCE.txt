Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM---------------------HOUSTON CHRONICLE--------------------------
8 oz Mushrooms, fresh
1    Garlic cloves, crushed
1 c  Light cream
12    Tomatoes, dried
Clean and slice mushrooms.  Put mushrooms and garlic in 4-cup measure.
Cover with vented plastic wrap. Microwave on high 3 minutes. Do not
drain. Combine half and half and dried tomatoes in blender or food
processor. Process until tomatoes are chopped.  Pour mixture onto
mushrooms. Cover and microwave on medium-high 3 minutes, until
mixture is very hot. Excellent over drained hot pasta, topped with
Parmesan cheese.

Sylvia's comments: I thought this looked blah; I was right. It was
okay with a lot of added garlic salt, but not worth the trouble and
expense of the ingredients.
