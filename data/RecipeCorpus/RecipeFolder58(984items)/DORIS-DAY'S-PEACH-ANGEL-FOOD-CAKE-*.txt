Yield: 1 Cake

1 pk Angel food mix
2 c  Heavy cream
1 lb Fresh peaches
1 ts Ascorbic acid or lemon juice
" I wonder how they manage to sift so much glamour into a package
mix. The peaches and cream of this, my favorite recipe, are like
adding solid lyrics to music that sings alone...even the best can be
improved." Doris Day

Prepare angel-food mix according to directions. After mix cools, cut
into 3 layers. Whip cream until it stands in peaks. Peel, slice,
sweeten peaches to taste. Dissolve ascorbic acid (or) lemon juice and
add to prevent discoloration. Spread part of whipped cream on one
layer of cake, cover with peaches. Repeat, stacking layers on top of
each other. Top off with peaches and whipped cream. Serve
immediately. (A saw-toothed knife is best for cutting angel food
cake.) Saw, don't cut!
