Title: DONNA GERMAN'S SOURDOUGH STARTER
Categories: Breads, German
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Lukewarm water or milk
2 c  Bread or unbleached all
-purpose flour
2 1/2 ts Yeast
Mix together in a GLASS or PLASTIC BOWL the above ingredients. Do not
use metal utensils.  Cover the bowl with a tight fitting lid and
allow to sit in a warm, draft-free location for 4 to 7 days, gently
stirring once a day.

You may use your starter after 4 days.

To use your starter, simply remove the amount called for in the
recipe and add to the other ingredients. Replace the amount removed
with equal amounts of water/milk and bread/unbleached all purpose
flour. I always used bread flour.

After feeding your starter, leave on counter for 24 hours. At the end
of that period you may refrigerate your starter. You must refeed at
least once every 7 days, so I use my starter once a week. If you do
not plan to use it, then take one cup out and throw away and feed.

If you will be away on vacation you may freeze your starter, thaw it
in the refrigerator upon your return. As soon as it is thawed, remove
at least one cup and feed as above.

I alternate feedings, one week with milk, the next with water.
