Categories: Soups
Yield: 2 Quarts
MMMMM----------------INGREDIENTS PREVIOUSLY MADE---------------------
2 1/2 qt Chicken Stock;
-(See other recipe)
Put the previously prepared, cold, fat-free, 2-1/2 quarts of chicken
stock in an 8 quart pan. Add a whole stewing fowl or roasting chicken
weighing between 4 and 5 pounds. Bring slowly to a boil. Skim off any
scum that forms on the surface; reduce heat; cover and simmer gently
until the chicken is very tender, about 1 hour for a young chicken,
or 2 to 2-1/2 hours for a fowl. Remove the chicken/fowl and either
serve it as poached chicken, or remove the skin, take the meat from
the bones, and use it for other dishes such as chicken salad, hash,
chicken pie, or creamed chicken, etc. Strain the broth through
several thicknesses of cheesecloth into a bowl; let cool, then skim
off the fat. You now have 2 quarts of beautifully rich, strong broth
which can be used for cooking. Should you want to reduce it even
more, and clarify it for consomme' ... see the recipe: Chicken
Consomme' by James Beard. For chicken consomme' the broth must be
absolutely fat-free and clear. Therefore, it's important that you
strain the above through several thicknesses of cheesecloth, let
cool, and skim off all the fat.
