Title: DOUGH ENHANCER
Categories: Breads
Yield: 32 Servings
1 c  Lecithin granules
1/2 tb Vitamin C powder
1/2 tb Ginger, ground
Mix all ingredients and store in tightly closed glass jar.

Add 1 tb dough enhancer with each recipe calling for 2 or 3 cups of
flour. Alternately, double the amount of yeast in the recipe to
figure out the amount of dough enhancer to add. For instance, if your
recipe calls for 1/2 tb yeast, add 1 tb dough enhancer.  Stir into
dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients. Start machine.

Apparently, the ginger gooses the yeast and makes it act more
swiftly, the ascorbic acid strengthens the gluten, and the lecithin
aids the oil in causing the strands of gluten to slip against each
other more easily and thus rise better.

THE BREADMACHINE COOKBOOK IV by Donna Rathmell German has a section
titled "Dough Enhancers" and in that section it mentions Lecithin.
"Lecithin is a food supplement which is obtained from oil in egg
yolks or soy beans. It improves moisture and assists in expansion and
elasticity of the bread dough. Add between 1 and 1 1/2 tsp. of
lecithin granules per cup of flour."
