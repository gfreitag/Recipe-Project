Title: DESSERT BLUEBERRIES IN ARMAGNAC SYRUP
Categories: Canning, Desserts, Fruits, Harned 1994, Sauces
Yield: 3 Pints
2 pt Baskets ripe blueberries*
6    To 9 tb. Armagnac**
-- or to taste
3 c  ;Water
2 1/4 c  Sugar
*About 6 cups, either wild or cultivated.

**Cognac can be substituted for the Armagnac.

Sort blueberries, discarding any that are damaged or overripe, then
rinse and drain them.  Roll them on a terry towel to remove as much
moisture as possible.

Divide berries among 3 hot, clean pint canning jars, shaking them
down as you go so they are lightly packed; leave 1/2" of headspace.
Pour 2 to 3 tb. of Armagnac, according to taste, into each jar.

Boil the water and sugar together in a large saucepan, uncovered, for
3 minutes.  Fill the jars with the syrup, leaving 1/2" of headspace.
Remove any bubbles, adding more syrup if necessary. Seal jars
according to manufacturer's directions; process for 15 minutes in a
boiling-water bath. Cool, label and store the jars.

Keeps for at least a year in a cool pantry.

Witty writes: "Blueberries in brandied syrup can launch several
dessert possibilities.  Add spoonfuls of berries and syrup to fresh
autumn fruit - diced apples or pears, or both and sliced blue plums -
for an instant compote; ladle berries and syrup over ice cream, or
angel cake, or a vanilla-flavored rice pudding or blanc mange; fill
meringue shells with the berries and top them with whipped cream; or
layer the fruit and syrup with lightly whipped fresh ricotta in
parfait glasses."
