Title: DRY CURE SOUTHWEST JERKY
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
1 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
3 tb Chili powder
2 ts Cumin
2    Cloves garlic minced
2 lb Steak sliced thinly
Combine ingredients and thoroughly mix together. This is a dry
marinade so there is no liquid. Sprinkle the spice mixture on the
meat slices and work into the grain with your fingers. Cover and
marinate overnight. Place trays in the oven and dry at 145'F. for
first 4 hrs. then set oven 130'F. until dry.(4 to 8 hrs.) Jerky
should be hard but not brittle. Blot up any fat that appears with
paper towels. *For a chewy texture, slice the meat with the grain, or
across the grain for more tender jerky. Thats all! It may take a few
trys to figure out exactly how long to dry the meat, but you're still
eating while you're trying so it's not that bad. Well, good luck, I
hope that you like it. And, sorry this note is so long.
