Title: DOUBLE PEA SOUP
Categories: Soups, Jaw, Low-fat
Yield: 8 Servings
1 tb Olive oil
3 md Yellow onions, finely
Chopped
3    Cloves garlic, minced
4    Scallions, including tops,
Thinly sliced
2 c  Chopped lettuce (Boston,
Iceberg, or red leaf)
1/4 c  Minced fresh mint or 2 tsp.
Mint flakes, crumbled
1 ts Ground ginger
6 c  Water
1 1/2 c  Dried split green peas
1 ts Salt
10 oz Package frozen green peas,
Thawed
2 c  Skim milk
Parmesan cheese for garnish
Heat the oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven for 1 minute. Add the
onions and garlic and saute stirring occasionally, until limp, about
5 minutes. Add the scallions and toss to coat with the oil, then stir
in the lettuce, mint, and ginger. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Add
the water, split peas, and salt, and bring the mixture to a boil.
Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer 30 minutes longer. Add the
green peas and simmer, covered, until both the split peas and green
peas are tender, about 5 minutes. In a food processor or an electric
blender, puree the soup, working in batches if necessary, for 20
seconds. Return the soup to the saucepan and stir in the milk. Cover,
set over moderate heat, and bring to serving temperature, 3 to 5
minutes. Adjust the salt and sprinkle with the cheese.

jessann's note: these kind of soups are what the "Braun hand held
blender" were invented for! :)
