sieve to drain; set shells upside down on paper towels and let drain.
Discard seeds from tomato pulp; reserve liquid. Chop pulp and set
aside.

In small nonstick skillet heat 2 teaspoons oil; add onion and garlic
and saute until onion is golden. Stir in currants, salt, pepper, and 2
tablespoons of reserved tomato liquid; remove from heat and stir in
rice, nuts, parsley, mint, and sunflower seed.
