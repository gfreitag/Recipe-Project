Title: DIXIELAND FRYCAKES
Categories: None
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 c  Boiling Water
1 1/3 c  Grits
2 tb Golden Syrup, Honey or
-Light Molasses
1 tb Butter
3/4 c  Milk
2/3 c  All Purpose Flour
4 ts Baking Powder
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Vegetable Oil
1 c  Golden Syrup, Honey or
-Light Molasses
Combine the boiling water and grits in a heatproof bowl. Stir in the
first measure of syrup and the butter. Set aside for 5 minutes. Stir
in the milk. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a sifter.
Sift the flour mixture onto the grits. Stir until well combined. Heat
1 teaspoon of oil in a large, non-stick skillet. Spoon the batter
into the skillet to form 3 1/2" pancakes (they are fragile and its
just about impossible to turn them without breaking if they're
larger). Fry until golden on one side. Use a pancake turner to
carefully turn the cakes. Fry until golden on the second side.
Continue the process, adding oil to the skillet as needed. Serve warm
with syrup, preserves and/or fresh fruit.
