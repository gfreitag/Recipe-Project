Title: DIVINITY
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Egg whites
1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
2 c  White or brown sugar*
1 tb Vinegar*
1 c  Broken nutmeats
1 c  White raisins
If you use the brown sugar and vinegar, you may prefer to call this
Sea Foam. 1. Bring egg whites to room temperature. 2. Bring water and
corn syrup to a boil in a heavy pan. Add white or
brown sugar and vinegar, and stir until dissolved. 3. When
boiling, cover pan and cook about 3 minutes until the steam has
washed down any crystals that may have formed on the sides of the
pan. 4.  Remove lid and cook over moderate heat, without stirring, to
the hard
ball stage, about 250F.  While syrup is cooking, beat egg whites
in
a large bowl until they just hold their shape. When the syrup is
ready, pour it slowly over the egg whites in a steady thin stream,
whipping slowly at the same time.  Toward the end, add the syrup
more quickly and whip faster.  Do not scrape pan. 5. After all the
syrup has been added, put in nutmeats and raisins. 6. Beat until
candy can be dropped onto a buttered surface into patties
which hold their shape. ~--
