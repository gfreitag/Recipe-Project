MMMMM-------------------------THE CREPES------------------------------
3/4 c  Flour, pastry, whole wheat
1/4 ts Salt
2 ts Vegetable oil, cold pressed
1 1/4 c  Soymilk, mild
1. To prepare the sauce, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small saucepan,
add the flour and whisk while cooking for 1 minute. Remove from the
heat and pour in the hot soymilk all at once. Whisk briskly and
return to the heat. Bring to a boil,continuing to whisk, and cook for
2 minutes mor or until the sauce has thickened. If lumps appear
during cooking, beat with an eggbeater until smooth. Remove 1/4 cup
of this white sauce and reserve for use in the filling. Combine the
rest of the white sauce with the Tomato Sauce and reheat just before
serving.

2. To prepare the filling, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large
skillet and add the mushrooms, garlic, thyme, basil, salt and pepper.
Mix well, cover and cook for 20 minutes. Remove the cover, add the
walnuts and cook a few minutes more to absorb the extra liquid.
Combine with the reserved white sauce.

3. Prepare the crepes last. Sift together the flour and salt.
Combine 2 tablespoons of oil and soymilk and mix well. Pour the
soymilk mixture into the flour and mix well. If there are small
lumps, beat with an egg beater for 30 seconds, not more. Heat an
8-inch, nonstick, coated skillet, or coat an uncoated sillet with a
thin film of lecithin. When a drop of water sizzles on the skillet,
the skillet is ready to cook the crepes. Pour a couple of tablespoons
of the batter into the skillet, immediately tipping the skillet
around in all directions to coat the bottom completely. Cook for
about 1 minute or until the crepe is golden brown. Loosen the edges
of the crepe from the skillet and turn over with a spatula. Cook for
another minute. Repeat until all the batter is used up. Stack the
crepes on a dish until ready to use.

4.  Lay a row of filling down the center of each crepe and roll up.
Place them side by side in a serving dish, cover with warm sauce and
serve.
