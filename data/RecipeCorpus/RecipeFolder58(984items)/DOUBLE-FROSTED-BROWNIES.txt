Title: DOUBLE-FROSTED BROWNIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 1 Dozen
MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
2 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
-(2 squares)
1/4 lb Butter
2 lg Eggs
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Nuts, chopped
-(walnuts are traditional)
MMMMM-----------------------FIRST FROSTING----------------------------
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Butter
1/2 c  Half-and-half (also
-called light cream)
1 ts Vanilla extract
MMMMM----------------------SECOND FROSTING---------------------------
3 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
-(3 squares)
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Melt about 2 oz of chocolate and the
butter in a heavy saucepan, then let it cool. Be careful not to let
the chocolate burn.

Beat the eggs in a large bowl until they are blended. Add about 1 cup
200 g of sugar and mix well. Stir in chocolate-and-butter mixture.
Mix until the chocolate is fully incorporated, with no streakiness.
Add the vanilla, flour, salt and nuts. Stir just until the flour is
incorporated; over-stirring will make a tough brownie.

Spread the mixture in a greased pan, about 11 x 7 inches, that is
about 1 1/2 inches deep. Bake in pre-heated oven for 20 to 25
minutes. Cool in the pan on a rack. While it is cooling, follow these
instructions to make the first frosting:

Mix about 1 1/2 cups sugar, about 1/3 cup butter and about 1/2 cup of
half-and-half in a heavy, medium-size saucepan. Bring to a boil, then
cook over moderate heat without stirring until a small amount of the
mixture forms a soft ball when dropped in ice water, or it reaches
236 degrees F. on a candy thermometer.

Remove from heat immediately and cool in a pan of ice-water until the
candy is lukewarm. DANGER: melted sugar cools very slowly. You can
burn yourself badly by testing it with your finger.

Add about 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the candy. Beat it until it is
creamy and of a spreading consistency. This is most easily done with
an electric mixer, although you can use a heavy wire whip. Spread the
frosting over the brownies.

Melt the remaining 3 oz chocolate and spread over the frosting just
put on the brownies. Cover as evenly as possible. Cool for several
hours in a refrigerator, then bring to room temperature and cut into
pieces to serve.

Be very careful when melting chocolate.  It burns easily. A double
boiler is probably the best way thing to use.

It is critical to cook the first frosting to just the right point. If
cooked too little, it will be too thin to beat to a creamy
consistency. If cooked too much, it will be too brittle. So keep a
close eye on it; sugar tends to cook slowly to the soft-ball stage,
then it cooks quickly.

NOTES:
