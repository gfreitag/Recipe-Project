1 3/4 c  Sugar
1 3/4 c  Flour
2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
5 oz Unsweetened chocolate,
-melted

1 ts Vanilla
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
6 oz White chocolate
1/4 c  Butter - NOT margarine
1/4 c  Whipping cream
Whipped cream
Grease and flour (I used cocoa) 9" springform.  (I used a 9x13" glass
casserole).  Mix all in order. Bake 350F for 35-40 minutes, until a
toothpick comes out of the center clean.

Cool 10 minutes.  Remove from pan.  (I left it in the casserole) Push
handle of a wooden spoon into the cake to make holes all over the top.

Melt white chocolate (CAREfully - it'll burn easily) along with
butter and whipping cream.  Beat smooth and cool slightly. Pour into
holes in cake and cool. Cover with whipped cream, drizzle chocolate
over top. (I used whipped topping, because I wasn't sure how well
whipped cream froze. I covered it and froze - it was great. I just
cut slices as I needed them and left it in the freezer.)
