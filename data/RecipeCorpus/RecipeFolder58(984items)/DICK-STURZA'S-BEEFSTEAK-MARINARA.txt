Dick Sturza was all set for a juicy beef Stroganoff; the beef was
cubed, the mushrooms were sliced, and all the other necessary
ingredients were at hand. Then tragedy struck. The sour cream had
gone over the hill, and there was no time to replace it. He
improvised brilliantly by creating this beefsteak marinara, a
casserole with satisfying complexity of flavor that can be started
well before the dinner hour and will require little attention before
serving time.
=======================================================
============== ===
1. Cut meat into 3/4" cubes. Pour 1 tablespoon oil into a 10-12"
frying pan over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add meat, a
portion at a time, cooking until well browned; stir often. Transfer
meat with a slotted spoon to a shallow 3 to 3 1/2 quart casserole.
2. Add 1 tablespoon oil to the frying pan along with onion, garlic,
and mushrooms; stir often until onion is limp, about 10 minutes. With
a slotted spoon, transfer mixture to casserole. Melt butter in frying
pan, add flour, and stir until mixture bubbles. Smoothly blend in
consomme, wine, tomato paste, parsley, basil, oregano, and tomatoes
(break them up with a spoon) and liquid; stir until boiling.
3. Mix sauce with ingredients in casserole. Cover tightly with foil
and bake in a 350'F. oven until meat is very tender when pierced,
about 2 1/2 hours. Serve over hot cooked spaghetti and add salt and
pepper to taste. Makes 4-5 cups.
