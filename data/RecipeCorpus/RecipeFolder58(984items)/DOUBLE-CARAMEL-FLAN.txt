Categories: Mexican, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 8 Servings
1/3 c  Sugar
2 c  Milk
2/3 c  Caramel powder (recipe
-precedes)
6 lg Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan, frequently shake sugar over
medium heat until all is melted and the color is deep amber, 3 to 5
minutes. Immediately pour into an 8- to 9-inch diameter
straight-sided baking dish or pan (at least 1-qt. size).  Quickly
rotate dish to coat bottom.

In a 1- to 1 1/2-quart pan over medium-high heat, stir milk and
caramel powder until all the caramel melts (it hardens first), about
7 minutes. In a bowl, whisk some hot liquid with eggs and vanilla;
stir back into pan. Remove from heat.

Pour mixture into prepared baking dish.  Set dish in a larger rimmed
pan, pour 1 inch boiling water into outer pan. Bake in a 350F oven
until center of flan jiggles only slightly when gently shaken, 35 to
45 minutes.

Remove dish with flan from water.  Let cool, then cover and chill for
at least 3 hours or up to 2 days. To serve, run a thin knife between
flan and dish. Invert platter over flan; holding together, invert.
Lift off pan. Cut into wedges.

Makes 8 servings.
