Title: DOWN-HOME MASHED POTATOES
Categories: Potatoes, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
1    11-ounce potato per person
1 tb Butter for each potato
Milk as needed (1/4 to 1/2
-cup per potato)
Salt and white pepper, to
-taste
Paprika, for garnish
Mashed potatoes need not be perfectly smooth; in fact, a few small
lumps improve the texture.  Nor should the milk be premeasured and
heated: The quantity needed will depend on the type and age of the
potatoes. (Mealy baking potatoes that have been stored for a long
time take more milk than new potatoes.) just pour milk in gradually,
beating after every addi- tion, until the potatoes are just right.  A
few minutes in the oven before serving will reheat and puff up the
potatoes .

1.  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, peel
potatoes and quarter or halve them (depending on size). Drop potatoes
into the pot as they are peeled, even if water is not quite boiling
yet. Cook potatoes over high heat until fork tender (about 25 minutes
after water comes to a boil).  Some pieces can be left a little
underdone. Drain well.

2.  Place potatoes and butter in a large bowl.  Using a potato masher
or fork, coarsely mash them together. Make a well in the center and
pour in a small amount of milk.

3.  With an electric mixer (not a blender or food processor, which
will turn potatoes into a starchy goo) beat potatoes, adding more
milk a little at a time as needed, until the desired texture is
obtained. Tasting carefully, add salt and pepper.  At this point,
potatoes can be set aside, uncovered, until the rest of dinner is
nearly ready. one half hour before serving time, preheat oven to 350F.

4.  Mound potatoes in an oven proof casserole, sprinkle with paprika,
and bake uncovered for 20 minutes.
