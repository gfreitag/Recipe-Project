Categories: Mexican Breads
Servings: 12
4 c  Flour
1 T  Baking powder
2 t  Sugar
1 1/2 t  Salt
1/4 c  Shortening or lard
1 1/4 c  Water or more if needed
Sift dry ingredients together. Cut in shortening until
crumbly. Add water and mix until holds together. Knead
10-15 times until dough forms a smooth ball. Cover and
let set for 20 minutes. Divide dough into two parts.
Roll dough to 1/8" thickness on lightly floured board.
Cut into 3" squares or triangles. Do not allow to dry;
cover those waiting to fried. When ready to fry, turn
upside down so that surface on bottom while resting is
on top when frying. Fry in 3" hot oil until golden
brown, turning once. Add only a few at a time to
maintain proper temperature. Drain on paper towels.
