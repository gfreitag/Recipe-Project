Title: Pecan Pralines - Patout
Categories: Cajun Candies
Servings: 24
2 c  Heavy cream
4 c  Raw or brown sugar
1 t  Vanilla
2 c  Pecan halves
2 T  Butter
Alex Patout swears his recipe makes "The creamiest
pralines anywhere" Butter a medium saucepan--this will
make it easier to clean later.  Pour in the cream and
place over high heat.  When it begins to boil, add the
sugar and stir rapidly until it dissolves.  Then stir
in the vanilla and pecans and continue to cook over
medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture
reaches the soft-ball stage (236F on the candy
thermometer). Remove from heat and quickly beat in the
butter--this helps arrest the cooking process.  The
candy should lose its glossy color and become very
cloudy.    Lay out a long strip of waxed paper on a
work surface.  Moisten it with a damp towel.  Drop
good-sized spoonfuls of the hot praline mixture onto
the waxed paper, stirring the mixture occasionally as
you go along to keep it well combined.  Remove the
pralines from the paper before they have cooled
completely--later on it will be hard to remove them
without breaking them.  Store in tightly sealed
containers, with layers of waxed paper in between.
