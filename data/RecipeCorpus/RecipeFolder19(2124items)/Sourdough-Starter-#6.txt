Title: Sourdough Starter #6
Categories: Breads
Servings:  1
1 c  Milk
1 c  Unbleached Flour
Let milk stand for a day or so in an uncovered
container at room temperature.  Add flour to milk and
let stand for another couple of days. When it starts
working well and smells right, it is ready to use.
NOTE: All containers for starters not using yeast,
must be carefully scalded before use.  If you are
carless or do not scald them the starter will fail.
