Title: Sur Le Gril Chopped Liver
Categories: Meats
Servings:  4
1 lb Fresh Calves' Liver
2 tb Salad Oil
3 tb Butter
1 ea Large Spanish Onion, chopped
1 ea Egg, hard-cooked, mashed
1 x  Salt
1 x  Freshly Ground Pepper
With a sharp knife, remove the tough outer membranes
from liver. In a heavy skillet, heat oil and add
chopped onions. Cook over medium high heat until
translucent and golden brown. Remove with a slotted
spoon and set aside.
Add butter to skillet. Heat until melted. Add liver
pieces. Over medium heat, fry liver until just done -
3 minutes on each side. Alternatively, liver can be
brushed with butter and broiled. To test for doneness,
cut a piece from liver slice. If still pink, continue
cooking for 30 - 60 seconds. Overcooking causes the
liver to be dry and tough. For finely mashed egg that
disappears in the liver mixture, force egg through a
wire strainer. For best results, separate the hard
cooked whites from yolks and sieve them separately.
Set aside. Fit meat grinder with a medium blade and
place cooked liver and cooked onions in the grinder.
Grind, then regrind the ground mixture. In a medium
mixing bowl, combine the twice ground meat and onions
mixture with the sieved eggs. Add salt and pepper.
Taste and adjust seasoning. If desired, add a few
drops of commercial gravy browning liquid to heighten
color. Refrigerate for 24 hours before serving. Serve
with slices of tomato, cucumber and dark rye bread.
Serves 4.
