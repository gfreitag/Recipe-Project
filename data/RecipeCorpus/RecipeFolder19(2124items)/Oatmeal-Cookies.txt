Categories: Children Low-cal Cookies

1/4 t  Salt
2 T  Light Sesame Oil

Preheat the oven to 375 deg F. Mix the dry
ingredients in a bowl. Add the oil and mix. Add the
juice (plus remaining ingredients, if desired.) If the
dough seems too dry, add more juice. Drop by the
teaspoonful onto a greased cookie sheet and flatten
slightly to ensure a crisper cookie. Bake until golden
brown, about 15-20 minutes. VARIATIONS:

Use oat flour and add 1 T arrowroot flour or powder.
* Use pineapple juice instead of apple for sweeter
cookies. * To use leftover oatmeal, use 1 cup juice
and 2 T honey or other sweetener.
