Heat the oil in a large pot over a medium-high flame.
When hot, put in the  peppercorns,  cloves,  bay
leaves,  and cardamom pods.   Stir for a second.  Now
put in the onions,  garlic and ginger.   Stir and fry
until the onions develop brown specks.  Now add the
meat, ground cumin, ground coriander,  cayenne pepper,
and 1q/2 of the salt.   Stir and fry for  a minute.
Add  1 tablespoon of the yogurt.   Stir and fry for
a  minute. Keep doing this until all yogurt has been
incorporated.  The meat should also  have a slightly
browned look.   Add the spinach and the  remaining
salt.   Stir to mix.   Keep stirring and cooking until
the spinach wilts completely.   Cover  tightly and
simmer on low heat for about 1 hour  or until meat is
tender. Remove the lid and add the garam masala.  Turn
the heat to medium.  Stir and  cook  another  5
minutes until most of the water  in  the  spinach
disappears and you have a thick,  green sauce.
Remove the whole spices and serve.
