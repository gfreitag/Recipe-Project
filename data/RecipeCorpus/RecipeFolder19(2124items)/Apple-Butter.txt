Title: Apple Butter
Categories: Fruits Spreads
Servings: 12
3 qt Unsweetened Applesauce
2 lb Granulated Sugar
1 lb Brown Sugar
3/4 c  Apple Cider
--------------------------SPICES--------------------------
1/2 t  Nutmeg
1/4 t  Allspice
3/4 t  Cloves
3 t  Cinnamon
The thicker skinned, late Summer and Fall apples
produce a grainier texture that's best for applesauce.
Stir applesauce, sugars, and cider together and cook
in a slow oven (325 deg F.) for 3 hours, stirring
occasionally.  Add spices. Return to oven and cook 1
hour more. Apple butter requires long, slow cooking.
(Can also be made in a crockpot.)
