Poach chicken by placing in a large pot with enough
cold water to barely cover.  Add peppercorns, bay
leaf, parsley, thyme and one each: onion, carrot and
celery cut into quarters.  Bring to a bare boil with
lid on; reduce heat to low and simmer for 50 minutes.
Cool in poaching liquid, then drain, skin and shred.
To make curry flavouring, soften diced onion in hot
oil, then add curry powder and cook over medium-high
heat for a further 3 minutes.  Add wine and water.
Boil rapidly until reduced to about 3 tablespoons.
Strain and let cool. Prepare curry mayonnaise by
combining all ingredients until smooth. Place peppers
in a large bowl (reserving a little for garnish), with
chicken, pasta, salt, pepper and curry mayonnaise.
Mix gently until well- coated.  If mayonnaise mixture
is too thick, add warm water gradually until a smooth
consistency is attained. Place a portion of salad on
bed of spinach and sprinkle reserved peppers on top.
Assemble just before serving, as the mayonnaise
quickly loses its fresh look.
