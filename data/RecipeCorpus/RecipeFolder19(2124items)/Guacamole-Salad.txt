Title: Guacamole Salad
Categories: Mexican Salads Appetizers
Servings:  4
5 ea Large avocados
1 ea Medium garlic clove, minced
1 ea Medium tomato, chopped
4 oz Can chopped green chili
2 1/2 T  Lemon or lime juice
1 t  Salt
Peel and chop avocados into a bowl. Mash with garlic
and lemon juice. Add remaining ingredients, mixture
will be chunky. To prepare individual salads, spoon
mixture on shredded or whole lettuce leaves. Top with
diced tomato for garnish and serve with tortilla
chips. If made ahead of time, save pit and put in dip
until time to serve to prevent darkening.  NOTE: This
is my own recipe and the chili can be adjusted to
taste. Also, I sometimes replace the tomato and green
chili with salsa.
