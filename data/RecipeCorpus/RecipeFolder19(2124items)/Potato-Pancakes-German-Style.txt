++++++++++++++ ++++ Grate raw potatoes into water to
which lemon juice has been added.  Place potatoes in a
strainer or cheese cloth and drain off liquid.  Drain
well. Beat raw and cooked potatoes with egg, milk, and
salt to form a batter. Using 3 T oil for each batch,
drop batter for 3 or 4 pancakes at a time in hot oil
in a large frypan.  When firm on the bottom side,
loosen edges and turn.  Brown on other side.  Remove,
drain on paper towel, and keep warm. Continue until
all batter is used.  Serve immediately. NOTE: If
potato cakes are served with meat, sprinkle with salt.
Sprinkle with sugar if served with applesauce.
