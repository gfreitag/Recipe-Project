Title: Stuffed potatoes
Categories: Children Side dishes
Servings:  4
4 x  Med Potatoes, baked
1 T  Unsalted Butter
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Grated Cheddar Cheese
1/4 t  Salt
1 c  Broccoli florets, parboiled
For little people these can be a meal in themselves.
Adults might want to add fish or chicken or perhaps
just a salad.  Preheat the oven to 350 deg F.
Carefully spoon the potato out of the skin; save the
skins. Mash the potatoes with butter until fluffy,
then add the milk and mash smooth. Mix in the cheese,
salt, and broccoli and scoop the mixture back into
potato skins. Bake in a shallow pan for 10 min or
until cheese is melted and tops of potatoes are
lightly browned.
