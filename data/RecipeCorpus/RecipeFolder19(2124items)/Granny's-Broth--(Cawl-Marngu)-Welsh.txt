Title: Granny's Broth  (Cawl Marngu) Welsh
Categories: Soups
Servings:  4
2 lb Best end of neck Welsh lamb
1 ea Small swede (Turnip)
1/2 lb Carrots
1 lb Potatoes
2 ea Large leeks
1 oz Parsley
1/2 oz Flour
1 x  Salt and pepper
Put the meat into the saucepan, cover with cold water,
add salt and pepper, bring slowly to the boil and skin
carefully.  (This can be done the night before and the
fat allowed to set on the surface.  This makes it
easier to skim off.)
Then add the carrots (cut in half), the swede (sliced)
and the white of the leeks, and simmer gently for 2 -
2 1/2 hours. Add the potatoes (cut in four) and
continue to simmer for another 30 minutes.
When the potatoes are almost cooked, thicken with
flour and a little water. Lastly, add the green of the
leeks and parsley (chopped) and simmer for further 10
minutes and serve in basins while hot. Cawl was the
dish most commonly served for dinner on the farm
during the winter months in th ecounties of South and
West Wales. The broth itself would be served in basins
or bowls, with bread, and the meat and vegetables
served as a second course. Croeso Cymreig
