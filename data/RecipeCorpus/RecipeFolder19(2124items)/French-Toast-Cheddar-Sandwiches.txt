Set out a heavy skillet or cast iron griddle.  Beat
the eggs slightly in a pie tin or shallow bowl and add
the milk or cream and salt, set aside. Spread the
bread slices out on a flat working surface.  Spread
one side of four slices of bread lightly with the
prepared mustard.  Top each with a slice of cheddar
cheese.  Butter the remaining four slices of bread and
top each cheese slice with bread, butter side down.
Heat the butter in the skillet or on the griddle.
Carefully dip each sandwich into the egg mixture,
coating both sides.  Allow the excess egg mixture to
drain back into the bowl.  Dip only as many sandwiches
as will lie flat in the skillet or griddle.  Cook over
low heat until browned.  Turn and brown the other
sides.  Repeat for the remaining sandwiches and if
necessary, add more butter to the skillet or griddle
to prevent sticking.  Or you can place the sandwiches,
after dipping, on a well greased baking sheet and
brown in the oven at 450 degrees F. for 8 to 10
minutes.  Serve hot.
