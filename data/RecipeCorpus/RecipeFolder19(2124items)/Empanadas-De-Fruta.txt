---------------------------DOUGH---------------------------
6 c  Flour
1 t  Salt
1 T  Sugar
3/4 c  Shortening
1 1/2 c  Water
-----------------------FRUIT FILLING-----------------------
20 oz Mixed dried fruit
1/2 lb Raisins
3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 t  Cloves
1 t  Cinnamon
1/2 t  Nutmeg
1 c  Pinon nuts(other nuts okay)
Mix flour, salt and sugar; add shortening and mix
well. Add beaten egg to water and then to dry mixture.
Dough should be soft but not sticky. Make small balls
of dough. Roll out to 5 inches diameter and 1/8"
thick. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling on half of
rolled out dough turning other half of dough over and
pressing edges together. Pinch edges between thumb and
fore finger giving the dough a half-turn. Fry in deep
fat until golden brown. Drain. To make fruit filling,
add enough water to cover the dried fruit and raisins.
Cook over low heat until tender. Add sugar, spices,
and nuts. Mix until well blended. ( A 21 oz. can of
fruit pie filling can be substituted for the fruit
filling.)
