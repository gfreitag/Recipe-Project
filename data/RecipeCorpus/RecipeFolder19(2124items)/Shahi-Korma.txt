8 ea cloves garlic
1 ea 1" cube of fresh ginger
5 T  blanched slivered almonds
1 c  water or beef broth
7 T  vegetable oil
2 lb boned lamb or beef (1" cubes
10 ea whole cardamom pods

1 t  ground coriander

1/4 t  garam masala
Put the garlic,  ginger,  almonds,  and 6 tablespoons
water in a blender and blend until you have a paste.
Heat  the oil in a wide,  heavy,  preferable non-stick
pot or wok over a medium-high heat.  When hot. put in
just enough meat pieces so they lie, uncrowded in a
single layer.    Brown the meat pieces on all sides,
then remove them with a slotted spoon and put them in
a bowl.   Brown all the meat this way.
Put the cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon into the hot
oil.  Within seconds the cloves will expand.  Now put
in the onions.  Stir and fry the onions until they
turn a brownish color.  Turn the heat down to medium.
Put in the paste from the blender as well as the
coriander, cumin, and cayenne. Stir  and fry this
mixture for 3-4 minutes or until it too  has  browned
somewhat.    Now  put in the meat cubes as well as any
liquid that might have accumulated in the meat bowl,
the salt, the cream, and rest of the water or broth
(a bit more for beef).   Bring to a  boil.   Cover,
turn heat  to  low  and simmer lamb for 1 hour and
beef for  2  hours.   Stir frequently during this
cooking period.   Skim off any fat that floats to the
top.  Sprinkle in the garam masala and mix.
