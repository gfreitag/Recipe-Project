Title: Roasted Garlic
Categories: Garlic Appetizers
Servings:  1
1 x  Whole Heads Of Garlic
1 x  Toasted Rounds French Bread
1 x  Softened Sweet Butter
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Remove the papery outer covering of whole garlic head,
but do not separate the cloves or peel them.  Place as
many whole heads of garlic on a large square of
heavy-duty aluminum foil as there are people to be
served.  Fold up foil so that the cloves are
completely wrapped. Bake in the preheated oven for 1
hour 15 minutes. Serve each diner a head of garlic and
some bread and butter.  Separate cloves.  Hold a clove
over a piece of buttered bread and squeeze.  The
garlic puree will pop out, like toothpaste from a
tube.  Spread and eat. GARLIC PUREE:
To make a batch of Garlic Puree for later use, let
roasted heads of garlic cool, unwrapped for at least 5
minutes. Gently separate the cloves and squeeze each
one over a fine meshed sieve, so that the softened
garlic pops into the sieve. With wooden spatula or
wooden spoon, rub garlic through the sieve into a
small container or bowl. Cover tightly with plastic
wrap and refrigerate the puree if needed. QUICK PUREE:
If you are in a hurry, you may skip the refinement of
the sieve.  Simply squeeze the cloves, one by one,
over a bowl.  When they have all been squeezed, use a
rubber spatula to push the puree into a neat mound
cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until
needed.  It will keep for months.  To keep
indefinitely, cover with a film of olive oil.
