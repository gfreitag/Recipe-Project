Work butter into flour with a fork and add sugar,
sour cream, and lemon rind, kneading to form a dough.
Form into a roll, wrap in waxed paper, and let rest
for 1/2 hour.  Cut roll in half. Roll out 1 part to
fit a 9"x9" pan. Line with apple slices and sprinkle
with raisins and sugar. Roll out remaining dough and
cut into strips to form a lattice pattern on top of
the apples. Brush with egg yolk, to which a little
cold water has been added.  Bake at 325 deg F. for
about 20 minutes, until golden brown. Dust with
confectioners' sugar while still warm, if desired, and
cut into 1" x 2" strips.  Makes about 30. Serve warm
or cold.
