Title: Assam Spicy Shrimp
Categories: Fish Main dish
Servings:  6
------------------------MARINATING------------------------
1 1/2 c  Water
2 lb Headless shrimp
1 T  Oyster sauce
1/2 t  Hot chili sauce
6 oz Tamarind
--------------------------COOKING--------------------------
3 oz Young ginger root
4 ea Large garlic cloves
1 t  Blachan
2 ea Small red onions
3 T  Oyster sauce
1 T  Dark soya sauce
1 T  Hot chili sauce
3 T  Oil
1/4 c  Packed brown sugar
MARINATING:  Break tamarind apart, place in a small
saucepan with water. Simmer, covered, for about 10
minutes or until pasty coating separates from seeds.
Press through a sieve or food mill to extract all
pulp and soupy liquid.  Discard seeds.  Rinse shrimps
thoroughly, pat dry and marinate fro 1 hour with 1
tablespoon of this tamarind liquid, the oyster sauce
and hot chili sauce. COOKING:  Meanwhile, cut young
ginger into toothpick-sized slivers.  If using mature
ginger, peel and sliver.  Peel and sliver garlic.
Place blachan in a non-stick pan and heat gently fro
3 to 4 minutes to develop the flavors.  Pell and cut
red onions into wedges.  Combine oyster, soy and chili
sauces with blachan; stir into remaining tamarind
liquid.  Heat a large wok over high heat.  When a drop
of water sizzles immediately into steam pour in 2
tablespoons of the oil.  Swirl up sides of wok, and
when just at smoking point, dump in ginger and garlic.
Stir fry until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Adding
more oil as needed, stir frey shrimp in batches until
orange red, about 3 minutes.  Pour sauces over all the
shrimp in the wok and cook at a brisk bubble over high
heat until shrimps are aromatic and sauces have
reduced and thickened to enrobe the shells, about 8
minutes.  Mix in sugar and onion wedges, taste to
adjust seasoning, sweetening and spiciness.  Makes
plenty for 6 as a principal dish with rice, enough for
8 with other dishes.
