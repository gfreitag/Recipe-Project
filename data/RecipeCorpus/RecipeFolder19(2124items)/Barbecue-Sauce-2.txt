Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl

over high heat until crisp. Stir in the onions, cover
pan, and continue cooking until onions are dark brown,
but not burned, about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Stir in the seasoning mix and cook about
1 minute.  Add the stock, chili  sauce, honey, pecans,
orange juice, lemon juice, orange and lemon rinds  and
pulp, garlic, and Tobasco, stirring well.  Reduce heat
to low;  continue cooking about 10 minutes, stirring
frequently. Remove orange  and lemon rinds.  Continue
cooking and stirring about 15 minutes more  to let the
flavors marry.  Add the butter and stir until melted.
Remove from heat.  Let cool about 30 minutes, then
pour into a food  processor or blender and process
until pecans and bacon are finely  chopped, about 10
to 15 seconds.  This sauce may be used to barbecue
chicken, pork or ribs. Makes about 5 Cups. From Paul
