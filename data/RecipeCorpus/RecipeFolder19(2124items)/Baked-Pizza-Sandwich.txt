Cook and stir the meat in a large skillet until
brown.  Drain off the excess fat.  Stir in half of the
tomato sauce and the oregano leaves into the meat
mixture.  Heat to boiling then reduce the heat and
simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.  While the meat
mixture is simmering, mix the baking mix, egg and the
milk.  Measure out 3/4 cup of the batter and set
aside.  Spread the remaining batter in a greased
baking pan 9 X 9 X 2-inches.  Pour into the remaining
tomato sauce over the batter, spreading evenly.  Layer
4 slices of the cheese, the meat mixture, the
mushrooms and the remaining cheese on top of the
batter and tomato sauce.  Spoon the reserved batter on
the top of the cheese.  Sprinkle the batter top with
the grated Parmesan cheese and bake, uncovered, until
it is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.  Cool for 5
minutes before cutting into squares and serving.
