Title: Rice, Apple and Raisin Dressing
Categories: Cajun Main dish
Servings:  8
-----------------------SEASONING MIX-----------------------
2 t  Salt
1 1/2 t  White pepper
1 t  Garlic powder
1 t  Dry mustard
1 t  Ground cayenne pepper
1/2 t  Black pepper
---------------------RICE INGREDIENTS---------------------
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 c  Chopped onions
1 c  Chopped green bell peppers
1/2 c  Pecan halves, dry roasted
1/2 c  Raisins
4 T  Unsalted butter
1 1/2 c  Uncooked rice (converted)
3 c  Pork, beef or chicken stock
2 c  Chopped unpeeled apples
Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl
and set aside.    In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil
over high heat until very hot, about 2 minutes.  Add
the onions and bell peppers; saute about 2 minutes,
stirring occasionally.  Add the pecans (we ran out of
pecans, so Lucy substituted hickory nuts - good!) and
continue cooking for about 3 minutes, stirring
occasionally.  Add the raisins and butter (these are
added together so the raisins will absorb as much
butter as possible).  Stir until butter is melted,
then cook until raisins are plump, about 4 minutes,
stirring occasionally.  Add the rice and seasoning mix
and cook until rice starts looking frizzly (a bit like
ce Krispies)  Chef Prudhomme recommended using
converted rice.  Lucy used brown, long grain rice -
super!.  This will require about 2 to 3 minutes,
stirring almost constantly before the rice looks
"frizzly". Stir in the stock, scraping pan bottom
well, then stir in the apples. Cover pan and bring to
boil; lower heat and simmer covered for 5 minutes.
Remove from heat and let sit, *COVERED*, until rice
is tender and stock is absorbed, about 30 minutes.
(We cook the rice this slow way to let the flavors
build to their maximum.)   Serve immediately, allowing
about 3/4 cup per person. From Paul Prudhomme's
"Louisiana Kitchen"
