~----------------- Mix meat and salt.  Shape mixture
into 4 patties, each about 3/4 of an inch thick.
Press pepper into both sides of the patties.  Cook
the patties in a large skillet over medium-high heat,
turning once, until the desired doneness is reached,
about 8 minutes.  Drain off the fat. Sprinkle the
cognac over the patties, immediately ignite, if
desired. Remove patties to a warm platter.  Stir the
wine into the drippings in the skillet.  Heat just to
boiling, stirring constantly.  Serve sauce over the
patties.
