firm, even crust.  Bake in a 375-degree oven for 5
minutes. Cool. For glaze, drain pineapple, reserving
juice(unsweetened juice).  Cut pineapple into small
pieces and set aside. Add enough unsweetened pineapple
juice (about 1 1/2 cups) to the reserved juice to make
1 3/4 cups total liquid.  In a small sauce pan stir
together pineapple liquid and gelatin, then let stand
5 minutes.  Stir over low heat until gelatin
dissolves.  Cover and chill to the consistency of
unbeaten egg whites (partially set).  Spread 1/3 cup
of the glaze over botton of crust.  Slice bananans and
arrange over glaze.  Top with another 1/3 cup of glaze
and arrange strawberries over glaze.  Stir together
pineapple pieces and remaining glaze, then spoon over
strawberries.  Chill for 2 to 4 hours or until set.
Before serving, arrange kiwi fruit on pie.
