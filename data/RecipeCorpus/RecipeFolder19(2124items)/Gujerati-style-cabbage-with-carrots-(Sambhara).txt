Categories: Indian Ethnic Side dish Spicy
Servings:  4
1/2 lb cabbage
1/2 lb carrots
1/2 ea Fresh hot green chili
2 2/3 T  vegetable oil
1 pn Asafetida
2/3 T  whole black mustard seed
1 ea Hot dried red chili
13/16 t  salt
1/3 t  sugar
2 2/3 T  chopped fresh coriander
2/3 t  lemon juice
Core  the cabbage and cut it into fine,  long shreds.
Peel the carrots and grate them coarsely.  Cut the
green chili into thin, long strips. Heat  the  oil in
a wide,  casserole-type pot over a medium-high  flame.
When  hot,  put in the asafetida.   A second later,
put in the  mustard seeds.   As soon as the mustard
seeds begin to pop, put in the dried red chili.   Stir
once.  The chili should turn dark red in seconds.  Now
put in the cabbage,  carrots and green chili.   Turn
the heat down to medium and stir the vegetables around
for half a minute.   Add the salt,  sugar and green
coriander.   Stir and cook for another 5 minutes or
until  the vegetables  are  just done and retain some
of their crispness.   Ad  the lemon juice.   Stir to
mix.   (Remove the whole red chili before serving to
those unfamiliar with Indian foods.)
