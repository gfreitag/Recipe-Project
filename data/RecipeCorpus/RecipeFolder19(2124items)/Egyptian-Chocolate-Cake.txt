2 t  Baking Powder
1 t  Cinnamon; Ground
1/8 t  Cloves; Ground
4 oz Semisweet Chocolate

Sift the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and cloves
together; set aside. Combine chocolate and coffee in
small saucepan.  Cook over low heat until the
chocolate is melted, stirring constantly.  Remove from
heat and cool to room temperature.  Cream the butter
and sugar together in a mixing bowl, until they are
light and fluffy.  Use an electric mixer set on medium
speed.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after
each addition. Beat in vanilla and chocolate mixture.
Add dry ingredients alternately with milk to the
creamed mixture, beating well after each addition.
Pour batter into 2 greased and waxed paper-lined
8-inch cake pans.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree F.
oven for 30 minutes or until cake tests done. Cool in
pans on racks for 10 minutes.  Remove from pans; cool
completely on racks.  To assemble the cake, place one
cake layer on serving plate. Spread with Cinnamon
Whipped Cream.  Top with second cake layer.  Frost
sides and top with remaining Cinnamon Whipped Cream.
Refrigerate until serving time.
CINNAMON WHIPPED CREAM:
Chill large mixing bowl and beaters.  Combine cream,
sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon and beat with an electric
mixer set at high speed until soft peaks form and
mixture is thick enough to spread.  DO NOT overbeat or
you will have butter instead of whipped cream.
NOTE:
The original recipe came from a GI who found it in
Egypt when he was stationed there.  Hence the name.
The whipped cream frosting was added later but really
adds to the recipe.
