the  mixture, yogurt  and  water.   Pour  sauce back
into  skillet.   Add  chicken  to skillet.  Place over
medium high head and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat,
cover and simmer until chicken is tender and sauce is
thickened,  about 45  minutes.   Remove from head.

low heat.  Transfer to serving dish, garnish and
serve immediately.
