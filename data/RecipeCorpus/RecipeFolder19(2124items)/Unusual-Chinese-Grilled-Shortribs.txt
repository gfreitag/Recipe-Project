4 ea Large, Meaty Shortribs
1/3 c  Oriental Toasted Sesame Oil
4 1/2 T  Peanut Butter
4 T  Brown Sugar
2 1/4 T  Curry Powder

Make shortribs into short, flat strips.  Begin by
placing rib fat-side-up on cutting board and cut 1/4"
high layer almost (but not through) the bottom-most
section of the rib.  Turn meat over and continue to
make 1/4" layers until the rib is completely layered
and is now one long strip. Using the edge of a Chinese
knife or otehr flat surface, pound meat until it is
off an even thickness. NOTE:  Chill the meat well.
This cutting method will not work well on room
temperature ribs. MARINADE:  (Curry Based Blender
Sauce) Blend all liquid ingredients in a blender for
about 15 seconds at "Blend" speed.
Grate the fresh ginger root and combine with the
minced garlic. Mince the white (only) portion of the
green onions.  Add all ingredients to blender mixture
and operate on "low" for about 45 seconds. Rub suace
onto butterflied ribs and refridgerate for 2 or more
hours. NOTE:  This sauce is excellent for chicken, too.
Place ribs on grill, basting often with sauce until
done, about 30 minutes depending on heat of grill.
Watch carefully to determine when done.
