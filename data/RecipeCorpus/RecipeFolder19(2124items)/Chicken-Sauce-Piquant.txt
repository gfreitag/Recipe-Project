Title: Chicken Sauce Piquant
Categories: Cajun Main dish Poultry
Servings: 30
2 c  Bacon drippings (for roux)
6 c  Plain flour
7 c  Onion, chopped
1 c  Bell pepper, chopped
3 c  Green onions, chopped
1 c  Celery, chopped
3 c  Parsley, chopped
1/4 c  Garlic, chopped
1 x  Bacon drippins/brown chicken
20 lb Baking hens, (see directions
1 x  Water
1 lb Mushrooms, sliced
16 c  Tomato sauce
8 c  Chablis wine
1 1/2 pt Stuffed olives
6 T  Lea & Perrins
8 T  Louisiana hot sauce
1 t  Dried mint, crushed
6 T  Salt
The bacon drippings are for browning the chicken.
The 20 lbs of chicken should be cut up in 2-inch-long
pieces. Justin likes more wine in this sauce than some
peoples.  If you don't wish to use all 8 Cups of
Chablis in the sauce, feel free to drink what the
sauce don't take.  Make sure you taste your sauce as
you add the wine.  Me, I likes it.  My wife, she
don't. Make a roux.  (see the recipe for Justin
Wilson's roux, also posted here).  Add onions, bell
pepper, green onions, and celery and saute until
onions are tender and clear.  Add parsley and garlic
and saute. Brown off chicken while roux is being made.
After onions, etc. are tender, add water to bring
roux to a smooth paste.  Add all other ingredients and
enough water to cover well.  Bring to a boil, and then
cut heat.  Cook for about 4 to 6 hours. Serve over
spaghetti.  This is for a party and will serve 20 to
40 people.  You can freeze what you don't eat. From
