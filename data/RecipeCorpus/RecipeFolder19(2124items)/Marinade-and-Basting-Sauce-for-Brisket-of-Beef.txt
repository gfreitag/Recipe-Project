Title: Marinade and Basting Sauce for Brisket of Beef
Categories: Cajun Sauces
Servings:  8
3 c  Dry red wine
3 t  Salt
1 c  Olive or peanut oil
3 T  Poupon mustard
2 T  Wine vinegar
2 T  Prepared horseradish
2 t  Onion powder
3 T  Lime juice
1 t  Garlic powder
2 t  Ground cayenne pepper
Mix all of the ingredients really well and then pour
over whole beef brisket.  Let marinate for several
hours, or overnight if possible.  Also, use this
marinade as a basting sauce.
Some people may find Justin's 3 cups of dry red wine a
little bit too much for their taste.  No problem, use
as much as you like in the sauce, and drink the rest.
Sure won't go to waste. From Justin Wilson's "Outdoor
Cooking With Inside Help"
