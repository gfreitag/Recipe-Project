Title: English Toffee
Categories: Desserts Candies Londontowne
Servings:  1
2 c  Sugar
1 c  Butter
2 T  Vinegar
1/4 c  Safeway gourmet golden syrup
1/4 c  Water
Combine all ingredients in large saucepan. Bring to a
boil, stirring until all dissolved, then boil without
stirring until the mixture is dark golden. Test by
spooning a few drops into a cup of cold water. The
toffee is done when it hardens at once into a crisp
ball. Take off heat and pour into a flat oiled pan to
make a layer about 1/2 inch thick. When toffee is
tepid, score into squares, and when cool break with a
hammer and store in an airtight container. Makes about
1.5 pounds. Mrs. Thomas H. Morton
