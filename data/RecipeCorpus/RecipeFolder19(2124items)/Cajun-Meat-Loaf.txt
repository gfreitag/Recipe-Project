Servings:  6
-----------------------SEASONING MIX-----------------------
2 ea Whole bay leaves
1 t  Salt
1 t  Ground cayenne pepper
1 t  Black pepper
1/2 t  White pepper
1/2 t  Ground cumin
1/2 t  Ground nutmeg
---------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS---------------------
4 T  Unsalted butter
3/4 c  Finely chopped onions
1/2 c  Green bell peppers, chopped
1/4 c  Green onions, finely chopped
2 t  Minced garlic
1 T  Tabasco sauce
1 T  Worcestershire sauce
1/2 c  Evaporated milk
1/2 c  Catsup
1 1/2 lb Ground beef
1/2 lb Ground pork
2 ea Eggs, lightly beaten
1 c  Very fine bread crumbs
Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl
and set aside.
Melt the butter in a 1-quart saucepan over medium
heat. Add the onions, celery, bell peppers, green
onions, garlic, tabasco, Worcestershire and seasoning
mix. Saute until mixture starts sticking excessively,
about 6 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping
the pan bottom well. Stir in the milk and catsup.
Continue cooking for about 2 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Remove from heat and allow mixture to
cool to room temperature.
Place the ground beef and pork in an ungreased
13x9-inch baking pan. Add the eggs, the cooked
vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs, remove the bay
leaves. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the
center of the pan, shape the mixture into a loaf that
is about 1-1/2 inches high, 6 inches wide and 12
inches long. Bake uncovered at 350F for 25 minutes,
then raise heat to 400F and continue cooking until
done, about 35 minutes longer. Serve immediately as is
or with Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef.
This is best using both ground pork and ground beef,
as the pork gives more flavor diversity. However, you
can make it with ground beef only. From Paul
