NONBREAD SANDWICHES:
* Lettuce Rollups: Use romaine, iceberg, or escarole.
You can even use spinach leaves if you have the
patience. Spread them with cream cheese, ricotta, or
any other filling. Or roll the lettuce around pieces
of cheese and chicken or turkey, perhaps with a
pineapple chunk if the kids like to mix tastes.
* Turkey Rollups: Use turkey instead of lettuce and
fill with the spread or filling of your choice.
* Variations: Use other wrappings for your rollups.
These could include cheese slices or low-fat sliced
luncheon meat.
