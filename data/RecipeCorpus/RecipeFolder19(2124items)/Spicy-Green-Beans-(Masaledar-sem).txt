1 1/2 lb fresh green beans
1 ea In cube peeled chopped ginge
10 ea Whole cloves garlic
1 1/2 c  water
5 T  vegetable oil
2 t  whole cumin seeds
1 ea Dried hot red chili

Trim  the green beans and cut them crosswise at 1/4 in

container of an electric blender or food processor.
Add 1/3 of the water and blend until fairly smooth.
Heat the oil in a wide,  heavy saucepan over a medium
flame.   When hot, put in the cumin seeds.   Five
seconds later,  put in the crushed chili. As soon as
it darkens,  pour in the ginger-garlic paste.   Stir
and cook for about a minute.   Put in the coriander.
Stir a few times.  Now put in the chopped tomatoes.
Stir and cook for about 2 minutes, mashing up the
tomato pieces with the back of a slotted spoon as you
do so.  Put in the beans,  salt and the remaining
water.  Bring to simmer.  Cover, turn heat  to  low
and cook for about 8-10 minutes or until  the  beans
are tender.   Remove the cover.   Add the lemon
juice,  roasted cumin, and a generous  amount of
freshly ground pepper.   Turn heat up and boil  away
all of the liquid, stirring the beans gently as you do
so.
