simmer for 2 minutes. Thicken with cornstarch and turn
off heat. Slowly pour in beaten eggs in a thin stream
while stirring. Serve immediately. Garnish with green
onion.
If soup is to be prepared ahead of time, do not add
cornstarch and eggs until serving time. Otherwise the
egg will be overcooked and spoil the appearance. Soup
should be quite hot and sour. Adjust the hotness with
varying amount of white pepper and the sourness with
different amounts of vinegar.
