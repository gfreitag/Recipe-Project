Flatten chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper
to thickness of 3/8 inch, using meat mallet or rolling
pin.  Mix cheese, breadcrumbs, minced parsley, salt
and pepper in large bowl.  Whisk egg with milk in
medium bowl to blend.  Dip chicken into egg, then into
breadcrumb mixture, coating completely and pressing to
adhere.  Shake off excess breadcrumbs.  Heat oil in
heavy large deep skillet to 375 degrees. Add chicken
and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about
4 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer to paper
towels and drain. Transfer chicken to platter. Melt
butter in small saucepan. Mix in lemon juice and pour
over chicken.  Garnish with lemon wedges and parsley
sprigs. *** My notes:  I found that 3/4 cup each
parmesan and breadcrumbs makes too much coating for 4
chicken breasts, so I reduced the amounts to 1/2 cup
each- which is still about enough for 6 breasts. I use
Bertolli Extra Light olive oil for frying, and just
enough to cover the bottom of the skillet.
