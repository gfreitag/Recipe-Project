Title: Guacamole
Categories: Dips
Servings:  5
1 ea Yellow onion quartered
1 ea Juice of 1/2 a lemon
1/3 c  Mayonnaise
1/2 t  Crushed chili peppers
1/2 t  Salt
2 ea Ripe avocados, halved pitted
Put the metal blade chopping in your food procesor,
then place the onion, lemon juice, mayonnaise, chili
peppers and salt in the work bowl.  Run the processor
nonstop for 10 seconds.  The onion should be minced,
and the other ingredients blended together. Use a
tablespoon to scoop out large chunks of avocado into
the work bowl. Clean out each avocado shell as
thoroughly as possible.  Distribute the chunks of
avocado around the chopping blade of the food
processor.  Pulse process two or three times, until
the mixture is churned, but lumpy (like cottage
cheese).
