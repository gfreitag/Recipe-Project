++++++++++++++++++ Lay steaks on a flat surface.
Spread each with mustard; sprinkle with salt and
pepper.  Divide pickles, salt pork (or bacon), and
onion among the steaks equally.  Roll up steaks
jelly-roll fashion; secure with beef-roll clamps,
toothpicks, or thread.  Heat oil in a heavy saucepan,
add the steak roll, and brown well on all sides, about
15 minutes.  Pour in hot beef broth, peppercorns, and
bay leaf.  Cover and simmer for 1 hour and 20 minutes.
Remove beef rolls, discard clamps, and arrange on a
preheated platter.  Blend cornstarch with a small
amount of cold water, stir into gravy and bring to a
boil.  Boil until gravy is thick and bubbly.  Correct
seasonings and serve separately.
