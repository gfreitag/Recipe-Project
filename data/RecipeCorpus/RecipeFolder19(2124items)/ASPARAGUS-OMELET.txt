Categories: Cheese/eggs Asparagus
Servings:  2
1/2 lb Asparagus, trimmed
2 T  Butter
1 x  Small clove garlic,minced
1/2 lb Mushrooms, sliced
4 x  Eggs, lightly beaten
2 T  Milk
1/2 t  Salt
1/4 t  Crushed dried basil or
3/4 t  Minced fresh basil..........
1 ds Freshly ground black pepper
Cut asparagus in 1 inch pieces; cook in boiling
salted water until tender, about 2 to 4 minutes.
Drain thoroughly.
Melt 1 T butter in 8 inch skillet, preferably one
with non-stick lining; saute garlic and mushrooms
until done and moisture has evaporated.  Remove from
pan; keep warm.
In a small bowl, combine eggs, milk, salt, basil
and pepper.  Melt remaining butter in skillet until
foamy, swirling it around pan to coat evenly.  When
hot enough that a drop of water sizzles when dropped
in, pour in egg mixture.  Tip pan so eggs coat skillet
evenly.  As eggs cook, periodically lift up cooked
edges, tilt pan and let uncooked egg run underneath.
When eggs are cooked, but surface is still shiny,
place asparagus and mushrooms on one side; slide out
of pan, folding side without vegetables over top.
Serve immediately
