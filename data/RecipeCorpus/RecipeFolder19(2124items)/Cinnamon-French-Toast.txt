This is an excellent source of protein,
carbohydrates, and (cooked in butter or oil), fat.
Beat the egg, milk,vanilla, and cinnamon together in
a flat dish such as a soup plate or pie pan, that will
accomodate the bread and make it easy to remove the
bread once it's wet. Add 1 slice of bread at a time,
turning so that both sides are coated and absorb some
of the liquid. Remove the bread, slice by slice, to a
plate. Heat butter or oil on a large griddle or
skillet, reduce the heat, and brown the bread briefly
on each side. Serve with syrup, honey, cooked or raw
fruit, or plain.
