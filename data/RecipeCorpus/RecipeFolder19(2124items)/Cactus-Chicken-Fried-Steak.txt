SALT-------------------------- *  Both of these items
should be available at grocery and specialty stores
that handle Mexican foods. Add the Jalapeno
seasoning salt to the flour and mix well.  Dip each
steak into the seasoned flour, then dip into the egg

the egg wash), and dip the meat back into the seasoned
flour, coating each steak well.  Heat the vegetable

and the drippings.  Add 3 Tbls of the leftover
seasoned flour.  Mix well and cook over medium heat,
stirring constantly, until the oil and flour are
golden brown.  Remove from the heat and add the milk
and chicken bouillon or chicken base.  Return to the
heat and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, until
the gravy thickens. Serve spooned over the steaks.
