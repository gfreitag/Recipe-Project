Title: Enchiladas Verdes (Green Enchiladas)
Categories: Mexican Main dish
Servings:  4
12 ea Corn tortillas
4 T  Oil or lard
1 ea Clove garlic
1 T  Flour
4 c  Green chili sauce
1 ea Salt to taste
2 c  Grated cheddar or jack chees
1/4 c  Minced onion
Fry tortillas in fat to soften. Heat garlic in oil
then discard garlic. Blend flour into oil. Stir in
green chili sauce and heat thoroughly. If mixture is
too thick, add water. Add salt to taste. Layer
tortillas with sauce, minced onion and cheese on
oven-proof plates. Sprinkle cheese on top. Use 3
tortillas for each serving. Place in oven to allow
cheese to melt.    NOTE: For a real New Mexican touch
place a poached or fried egg on top. The egg seems to
help meld the flavors.
