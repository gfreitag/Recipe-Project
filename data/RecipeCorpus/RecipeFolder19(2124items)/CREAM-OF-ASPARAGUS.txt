Categories: Asparagus Soups
Servings:  9
1 1/2 lb Fresh asparagus
1 1/2 c  Chopped onion
6 T  Butter + salt
6 T  All-purpose flour
2 c  Water or stock
4 c  Hot milk
1/2 t  To 1 t dill weed (to taste)
1 t  Salt
1/2 t  White pepper
2 T  Tamari soy sauce
Break off and discard tough asparagus bottoms.
Break off tips; set aside.  Coarsely chop stalks;
cook in skillet with onion in butter, salting lightly.
After 8 to 10 minutes, when onions are clear,
sprinkle with flour.  Continue to stir over lowest
possible heat 5 to 8 minutes. Slowly add water or
stock, stirring constantly.  Cook 8 to 10 minutes
stirring frequently, until thickened.  Cool slightly.
In blender, puree sauce bit-by-bit with milk until
thoroughly smooth.  Return puree to 3-quart pan-
preferably a double boiler.  Add dill, salt, pepper
and tamari.  Heat gently but don't boil.  As it heats,
cook asparagus tips in boiling water until tender, but
still very green, about 2 minutes; drain. Add whole to
soup.
