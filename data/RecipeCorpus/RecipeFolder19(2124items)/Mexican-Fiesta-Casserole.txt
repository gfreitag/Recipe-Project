~----------------- Heat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Cook and stir the meat in a large skillet until
brown.  Drain off the excess fat.  Season the meat
with the salt and pepper, then set aside.  Mix the
cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise and onion and set this
mixture aside.  Stir the baking mix and water together
until a soft dough forms.  With floured fingers, pat
the dough in a greased baking pan, 13 X 9 X 2-inches,
pressing the dough 1/2 inch up the sides of the pan.
Layer the meat, tomato slices, and green pepper onto
the dough. Spoon the sour cream mixture over the top
and sprinkle with the paprika, if used.  Bake
uncovered until the edges of the dough are light
brown, 25 to 30 minutes.  Cool 5 minutes and then cut
into squares.
