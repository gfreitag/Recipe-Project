1 ea Onion, large chopped
1 ea Green pepper, med., chopped
1 ea Zucchini, thinly sliced
1 c  Corn kernals
14 oz Tomatoes, canned plum w/juic
3 ts Tamari

Use cooked beans, or cook one cup of dry kidneys (or pintos) beans in
3 cups of water in a pressure cooker. Add a bay leaf or two, some
chili powder, cumin, a chopped onion, and perhaps a green pepper to
the water. Clean the dry beans and cook about 30-40 minutes in a
pressure cooker. Heat the oil in very large skillet.  When it is hot,
add the onion and saute over moderately low heat until the onion is
translucent. Add the green pepper and saute until it softens
somewhat. Add the remaining ingredients, including the beans, and
simmer over very low heat for 15 minutes stirring occasionally.
Serve on its own in bowls garnished with a chili and cheese, or even
better over brown rice.
