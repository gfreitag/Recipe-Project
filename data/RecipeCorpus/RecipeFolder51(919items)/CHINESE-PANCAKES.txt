Title: CHINESE PANCAKES
Categories: Chinese, Breakfast
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
3/4 c  Very hot water (or more)
2 tb Sesame oil
PUT THE FLOUR into a large bowl. Stir the hot water gradually into the
flour, mixing all the while with chopsticks or a fork until the water
is fully incorporated. Add more water if the mixture seems dry.
Remove the mixture from the bowl and knead it with your hands until
smooth. This should take about 8 minutes. Put the dough back into the
bowl, cover it with a clean, damp towel and let it rest for about 30
seconds. After the resting period, take the dough out of the bowl and
knead it again for about 5 minutes, dusting with a little flour if it
is sticky. Once the dough is smooth, form it into a roll about 18
inches long and 1 inch in diameter. Take a knife and cut the roll
into equal segments. There should be about 18. Roll each segment into
a ball. Take two of the dough balls, dip one side of one ball into
the sesame oil and place the oiled side on top of the other ball.
Take a rolling pin, and roll the two together into a circle about 6
inches in diameter. It is important to roll double pancakes in this
way because the resulting dough will remain moist inside and you will
be able to roll them thinner but avoid the risk of overcooking them
later. Heat a skillet or wok over a very low heat. Put the double
pancake into the wok or pan and cook it until it has dried on one
side. Flip it over and cook the other side. Remove from the pan, peel
the pancakes apart and set them aside. Repeat this process until all
the dough balls have been cooked. Steam the pancakes to reheat them,
or you can wrap them tightly in a double sheet of foil and put them
into a pan containing 1 inch of boiling water.
