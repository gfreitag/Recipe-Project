Title: CHICKEN WITH ONION MARMALADE
Categories: Poultry, Main dish, Low-fat
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Chicken breast halves
-(4-5 oz ea) boned & skinned
3 tb Cream sherry
2 md Red onions (about 6 oz each)
1/2 c  Dry red wine
1 tb Red wine vinegar
1 tb Honey
Parsley sprigs (optional)
Salt and pepper
Rinse chicken and put in a heavy plastic food bag; add 2 tablespoons
sherry.  Seal bag; rotate.  Chill at least 30 minutes or up to 6
hours; turn over several times.

Meanwhile, thinly slice onions; wrap several slices airtight and
chill up to 6 hours.  In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high
heat, combine remaining onion slices, wine, vinegar, and honey. Stir
often until liquid evaporates.  (If made ahead, cover and set aside
up to 6 hours; stir over medium-high heat to warm.) Remove from heat
and mix in remaining 1 tablespoon sherry.

Arrange breasts in a single-layer with marinating liquid in a 9- by
13-inch pan.  Bake, uncovered, in a 450 F oven just until meat is
white in thickest part (cut to test), 12 to 15 minutes. With a
slotted spoon, transfer chicken to a warm platter.  Spoon onion
mixture over chicken. Garnish with reserve onion slices and parsley.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
