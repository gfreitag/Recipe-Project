Yield: 4 Servings

2    Mandarines
1    Chicken
Sprigs thyme
3    Mandarines, juice only
Pomegranate, juice only
1    Pomegranate, quartered,
-seeds reserved
1 tb Butter, softened
1 tb Flour
This very seasonal dish - both mandarines and pomegranates are well
into their seasons now - is simple but unusual.

Segment 2 mandarines, being careful to remove as much pith as
possible, and if possible remove the seeds.

Remove the fatty pads from the cavity of a chicken and put the
chicken in an ovenproof dish, preferably a glass chicken roaster to
maximise final moistness. Surround the chicken with the mandarine
segments and a few sprigs of thyme. Halve and juice 3 more mandarines
and pour the juice over the chicken. Juice half a pomegranate and
add. Season. Roast in a 190 C oven for about an hour or until the
juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pierced with
a skewer. If not using a glass roaster with a lid, baste at intervals
during cooking.

Meanwhile cut another pomegranate into quarters and twist each wedge
to help free the seeds. Coax them out and reserve. Work together a
tablespoon of softened butter and a tablespoon of plain flour (to
make a buerre manie).

When the chicken is cooked, remove it and the mandarine segments to a
serving dish and keep warm.

Skim the sauce if necessary, then simmer it and add the beurre manie
in small pieces, whisking all the time until it is sufficiently
thickened. Taste the sauce for seasoning and pour over the chicken
and mandarines. Scatter the pomegranate seeds over the mandarine
segments and serve.
