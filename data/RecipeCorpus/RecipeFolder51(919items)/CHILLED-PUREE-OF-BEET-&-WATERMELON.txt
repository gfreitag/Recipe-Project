Title: CHILLED PUREE OF BEET & WATERMELON
Categories: Vegetables, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 md Onion; peeled and sliced
1/2 lb Beets; peeled, roughly diced
4 c  Chicken stock
-OR Low-sodium chicken broth
1 ts Salt
2 1/2 c  Diced seeded watermelon
- (rind removed)
HEAT THE OIL IN A STOCK POT over low heat, add the onions and cook
slowly, stirring, about 7 minutes. Add the beets and continue to cook
slowly, covered, until most of their water has been released and they
have fallen apart, about 35 minutes. Stir often to avoid sticking and
burning. Add the stock and salt, cover and bring to a boil. Reduce
the heat and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. When the soup is
finished cooking, strain and reserve the liquid. Transfer the beets
to a blender or food processor and add the watermelon. Puree until
very smooth. Return the puree to the pot and add the reserved liquid.
Chill the soup well, about 4 hours before serving.
