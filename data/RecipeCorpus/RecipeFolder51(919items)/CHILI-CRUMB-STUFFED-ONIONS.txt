Categories: Side dish, Vegetables, Jaw
Yield: 4 Servings
4 lg 14 to 16 oz each sweet
Texas onions
3/4 c  Dry bread crumbs
1/2 c  Chopped celery
1/4 c  Yellow cornmeal
1/4 c  Melted butter
2 ts Chili powder
2 ts Oregano
1/2 c  Water
To prepare each onion for stuffing, cut a thin slice from root end.
Slice off about 3/4 inch from stem end, leaving skin on. With small
knife or apple corer, scoop out onion and reserve for stuffing. Use a
spoon as needed to make a 1/2 inch shell. Do not cut through bottom
of shell. Each onion will hold about 3/4 cup stuffing. Finely chop
enough reserved onion to measure 1 1/2 cups. In medium bowl, mix
chopped onion with remaining ingredients except water. Place onions
in baking dish. Spoon filling into shells, mounding up. Add water to
dish and cover. Bake at 400 degrees until onions are tender, about 35
to 40 minutes.
