Spelling The word "chile" is both an adjective and a noun referring
to the plant and pod of a hot pepper, as in "chile pepper" (singular)
and "hot chilies" (plural). On the other hand, "chili" or "chilli" is
a stew-like mixture. "Chili powder" is a spice blend used to make
chili; it usually contains a combination of dried ground New Mexican,
Anaheim or Cayenne chile peppers, as well as garlic, cumin and other
spices.
