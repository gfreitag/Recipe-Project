Title: CHILI PASTE (PUREE)
Categories: New, Text, Import
see below
Yield: 4 Servings  :

Any combination of: 6 ounces dried Ancho, Chipolte, Cascabel, or other
chiles

Remove the stems and seeds from your choice of dried chiles. Pour
boiling water over the chiles

to cover and soak 30 minutes. Drain the chiles and puree them
thoroughly in a food mill or food processor fitted with a metal
blade. If you use a food mill, the result will be a smooth paste. If
you use a food processor, you may want to press the paste through a
sieve to produce a totally smooth paste. The paste can be stored,
covered and refrigerated 10 days to 2 weeks; if covered with oil, it
will keep in the refrigerator several months.

Yield: 1 1/2 cups
