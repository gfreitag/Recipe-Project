Title: CHILI SAUCE 3
Categories:
Yield: 5 Quarts
50 lg Tomatoes
12 lg Onions; chopped
5 lg Sweet red peppers; chopped
1 lg Bunch celery; chopped
3    Or 4 cloves garlic; crushed
2 ts Dry mustard
1 qt Cider vinegar
3 c  Light brown sugar
2 1/2 ts Salt
1 tb Ground pepper
2 1/2 tb Whole allspice
Scald and peel the tomatoes, cut into pieces and remove the seeds.
Put them to cook in a large kettle.. Bring to a rolling boil, lower
heat and continue to cook. As they cook, the solids will settle and
almost clear water will rise to the top.  Remove as much of this as
you can, so the sauce will be thick and not runny. When the tomatoes
are fairly thick, add the onions, red peppers, celery and garlic.
Blend the mustard with a little vinegar and add the mustard paste,
vinegar, brown sugar, salt, pepper and the allspice which has been
tied in cheesecloth. Cook gently 1 1/2 hours. Remove the spice bag
after the first half hour. Taste and add seasoning if needed. Pack
into hot sterilized jars and seal at once.
