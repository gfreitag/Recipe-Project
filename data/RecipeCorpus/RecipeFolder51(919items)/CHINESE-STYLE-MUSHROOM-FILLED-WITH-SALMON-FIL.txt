MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
Mushrooms, Inoki,
-- julienne
Carrot, julienne
Mushroom, Shitake,
-- julienne
Celery, julienned
Salt (to taste)
Pepper (to taste)
Oil, for frying
MMMMM-----------------------BRAISING SAUCE----------------------------
Lemon grass, white part
-- only, minced
2 tb Shallot, minced
2 tb Rice wine
2 tb Fish sauce
1 ts Sesame oil
2 tb Broth, chicken
1 ts Sugar
Rice, cooked
Cilantro (garnish)
Preparation: ============

First julienne the mushrooms and vegetables into thin, short
strips. Set aside.

Cut the salmon steak in half.  Take each half and slice it most of
the way through horizontally so the two pieces fold back on a hinge
like a hamburger or hot dog roll.

Prepare a braising glaze by mixing the "sauce" ingredients above
in a small bowl and stir and set aside.

Assembly: =========

Into each of the two salmon "sandwich" pieces, add a touch of salt
and pepper to taste and then add portions of Shitake, and Inoki
mushroom, celery and carrot as filling for the "sandwiches."

Close up the "sandwiches" and set aside.

To Cook: ========

In a small saute pan, heat a bit of peanut oil over high heat
until it begins to smoke and then put the salmon sandwiches in to
brown both sides (about 1 minute each side.)

When both sides are browned, add the braising sauce to the salmon.
Cover and braise over medium heat until the salmon is done ( 2 to 3
minutes).

Transfer the cooked salmon sandwiches to a serving plate and serve
with cakes of sticky rice and garnish with julienne fans of Szechuan
pickle.

Top with drippings from the saute pan, and pieces of Cilantro.
