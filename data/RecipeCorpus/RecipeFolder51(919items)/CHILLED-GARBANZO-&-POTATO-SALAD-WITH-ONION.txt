Title: CHILLED GARBANZO & POTATO SALAD WITH ONION
Categories: Pulses and, Salads, Sauces and, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Red Potatoes -- * see note
3    Italian Plum Tomatoes --
(red-ripe)
1/2 md Red Onion -- minced
16 oz Can Garbanzo Beans
1/4 lb Fresh Spinach -- ** see
Note
-----The Dressing-----
1 tb Extra Virgin Olive Oil
2 tb Red Wine Vinegar
4    Cloves Garlic -- minced
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Fresh Ground Black Pepper
1 tb Fresh Parsley -- minced
1/2 c  Water
1/4 ts Crushed Dried Hot Red
Chilies -- (or to taste)
* small red potatoes, scrubbed and cut into bite-sized pieces **
washed and finely chopped (optional)

First, mix all the stuff together for the dressing in a small bowl or
a measuring cup. Let that sit for at least a few minutes usually, if
you make it first, then do the potatoes and tomatoes, that's plenty
of time.

Next, bring about 4-6 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan (more is
better, but leave room for the potatoes), and add the scrubbed
bite-sized potato pieces. Bring back to a boil, and boil for 4-5
minutes. Do not overcook! You don't want them to be hard, but you
don't want them to be mush, either. Drain the potatoes, and rinse
well under cold water (or cover with cold water, then drain and
rinse).

Drain the garbanzo beans and rinse them thoroughly under cold water.

Cut the tomatoes into bite-sized pieces, but smaller than the potato
pieces. Chop up the spinach (if you're using it). Mix everything
together, including the dressing, in a bowl that is big enough to
stir it without dumping bits over the side.

Cover the bowl, and chill for at least 4 hours, tossing it once or
twice to make sure the dressing continues to coat things.

My modifications to this recipe were to increase the garlic, cut back
a lot on the oil, increase the potatoes, omit the sweet bell pepper,
and add an extra plum tomato. This is my favorite potato salad.
