Title: CHINESE BEETS
Categories: Vegetables, Newspaper
Yield: 4 Servings
6 c  Sliced beets, cooked  OR
3 cn Sliced beets, (12-16 oz can)
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Vinegar
2 tb Cornstarch
24    Whole cloves
3 tb Ketchup
3 tb Cooking oil (optional)
1 ts Vanilla extract
ds Salt
1 1/2 c  Beet liquid
Drain beets, saving 1 1/2 cups of the beet liquid. Place the beets in
a medium saucepan along with the reserved liquid and the rest of the
ingredients. Mix well, then cook over medium heat for 3 minutes or
until the mixture thickens. Let it cool, then store in the
refrigerator. They don't last long, so be ready to fix another batch.

(These are regular red beets pickled with an Oriental flair. My
mother, the original Heloise, brought this recipe back from China
when she and my father lived there after World War II. You can use
either fresh or canned beets. Bon appetit!--Heloise)
