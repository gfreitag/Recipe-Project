Title: CHICKEN WITH WATER CHESTNUTS
Categories: Poultry, Chinese
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Boneless chicken breasts
- skinned
1    Egg white
1 ts Salt
2 ts Cornstarch
1/2 lb Water chestnuts, fresh
- or canned (drained weight)
1/2 c  Peanut oil
1 tb Finely chopped garlic
2 ts Finely chopped ginger
1 tb Chili bean sauce
2 tb Dark soy sauce
2 ts Rice wine or dry sherry
2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Sesame oil
CUT THE CHICKEN into 1/2-inch cubes. Combine it with the egg white,
salt and cornstarch in a small bowl and put the mixture into the
refrigerator for about 20 minutes. If you are using fresh water
chestnuts, peel them. If you are using canned water chestnuts, drain
them well and rinse in cold water. Coarsely chop the water chestnuts.
Heat a wok or large saute pan until it is hot and add the oil. When
it is moderately hot, add the chicken cubes and stir to keep them
from sticking. When the chicken pieces turn white, about 2 minutes,
quickly drain the chicken and all the oil into a stainless steel
colander set in a bowl. Clean the wok and reheat. Return 2
tablespoons of oil to the wok, add the garlic and ginger, and
stir-fry for 30 seconds. Then add the water chestnuts, chili bean
sauce, soy sauce, rice wine, sugar and salt and continue to stir-fry
for 1 minute. Return the chicken to the wok and continue to cook for
another 2 minutes. Add the sesame oil, give the mixture a final stir,
and serve at once.
