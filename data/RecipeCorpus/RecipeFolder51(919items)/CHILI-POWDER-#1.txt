Break up the New Mexico, chipotle, and mulato chiles. Toast the
chiles in small batches on an ungreased skillet, or comal over medium
heat until they just begin to release their aroma. Do not let them
darken or the may become bitter. 2. Toast the cumin, coriander, and
cloves on an ungreased skillet, or comal over low heat until they
release their fragrance and become lightly roasted, about three
minutes. 3. Grind the toasted spices and celery seed (best to use a
spice grinder). 4. Grind the chiles in a spice grinder or food
processor. 5. Mix the ground chiles, spices, and ground cayenne. This
receipe is an adaptation of one appearing in "New Southwestern
Cooking" by Dille & Belsinger. Since I never have the chiles called
for in the receipe, I invariably "wing it." The spices seem to be the
important factor so substituting different chiles doesn't make a
major difference in the finished product. >From Glen Hosey's Recipe
