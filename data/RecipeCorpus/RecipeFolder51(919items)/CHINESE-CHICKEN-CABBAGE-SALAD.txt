Title: CHINESE CHICKEN CABBAGE SALAD
Categories: Salads
Yield: 1 Servings
2 tb Sugar
2 ts Accent*
2 ts Sesame oil
1 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Vinegar
1/3 c  Salad oil
1 bn Bok Choy
1 bn Napa cabbage
1 pk Ramen noodles
1    Chicken breast (optional)
4    Green onions
1 1/2 c  Unsalted peanuts (up to 2 c)
Mix dressing ingredients (sugar, Accent, oils, pepper and vinegar)
and let stand.  Boil and shred chicken breast. Slice bok choy and
cabbage and dice green onions. Break noodles into small pieces.
Combine bok choy, cabbage, chicken, noodles, onions and peanuts. Pour
dressing over combined ingredients and toss to coat.

* Instead of Accent, you can use 1/2 t. each of garlic and celery
salt and 1 t. seasoned salt.

Note: if served immediately, noodles are very crispy. I prefer to let
it sit in refrigerator for a while to "mellow."

This makes a good sized bowl of salad; not sure of the exact
servings, but at least 4-6 people.
