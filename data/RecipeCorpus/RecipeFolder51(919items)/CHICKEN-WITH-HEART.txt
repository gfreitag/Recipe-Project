Categories: Poultry, Maine
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Chicken breast halves --
Boned
2 tb Flour
1/4 ts Fresh ground black pepper
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Red onion -- thinly sliced
1/4 c  Madeira wine

Slice chicken into 2-inch strips. In a shallow bowl, combine flour and
pepper.  Lightly dredge chicken pieces in seasoned flour and shake off
excess. (Dredge just before sauteing or flour coating will become
gummy). In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Add
chicken and saute, turning once, until lightly golden on both sides,
about 2 minutes on each side.  Transfer chicken to plate. Reduce heat
to medium, add onion and cook, stirring constantly and scraping any
bits that cling to bottom of pan.  Add wine, turn heat to high and
cook, stirring constantly until wine has reduced to half, about 1
minute. Stir in artichoke hearts, reduce heat to medium and cook,
partially covered, stirring frequently for about 3 minutes. Stir in
lemon thyme. Return chicken to pan. Continue cooking over low heat,
partially covered, for an additional 2 minutes. Season with salt.
Serve immediately.
