Title: CHICKEN WITH FORTY CLOVES OF GARLIC
Categories: Poultry, Chicken, Main dish
Yield: 8 Servings
8    Chicken legs (cut into
Drumsticks and thighs)
2/3 c  Olive oil
4    Celery ribs, sliced thin
6    Sprigs parsley
1 tb Tarragon
1/2 c  Dry vermouth
2 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/8 ts Nutmeg
40    Cloves of garlic, peeled
Rinse the chicken in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Put
the oil in a shallow dish or a plate and turn all the chicken pieces
in the oil to coat all sides. Lay the celery slices in the bottom of
a heavy 6-quart casserole with a tight fitting cover.  Add the
parsley and tarragon. Lay the chicken pieces on top and sprinkle with
vermouth, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper and nutmeg. Pour the oil remaining
in the plate into the casserole. Toss in all garlic and sprinkle with
the remaining salt. Lay a piece of aluminum foil on top of the
casserole, to make a tight seal. Set on the casserole lid.  Bake in a
375-degree oven for 1 1/2 hours without removing the lid.  Serve with
hot toast or thin slices of French bread or pumpernickel, spread with
the softened buttery garlic cloves.
