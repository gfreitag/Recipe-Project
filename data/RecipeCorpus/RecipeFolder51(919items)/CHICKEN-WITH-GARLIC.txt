Categories: Poultry, Main dish

2 sm Heads garlic
Water
1/4 c  Chopped Italian parsley
Salt and pepper
2 tb Unsalted butter

If using whole chickens, halve chickens and bone completely except
for wing joint.  If only using breasts, bone completely. Place the
heads of garlic in water to cover in a small saucepan and bring to a
boil. Drain. Peel the garlic and cut each clove into paper-thin
slices. Toss in a bowl with the parsley, and season to taste with
salt and pepper. Loosen the chicken skin and stuff about 2 teaspoons
garlic mixture between the skin and the meat. Reserve remaining
garlic mixture. Set chicken aside. Prepare hot coals in a grill.
When the coals are ready, grill the chicken 5 to 7 minutes on each
side, or until the flesh is no longer pink. Do not overcook the
chicken or it will become dry. Heat the butter in a skillet, add the
reserved garlic mixture, and saute a few seconds. Add the lemon juice
and adjust seasonings.  Heat through. Place the chicken on a large
heated platter and spoon the garlic sauce over it.
