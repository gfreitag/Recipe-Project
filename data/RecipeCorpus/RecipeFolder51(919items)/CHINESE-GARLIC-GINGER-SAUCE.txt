Title: CHINESE GARLIC GINGER SAUCE
Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 1 Servings
3/4 c  Cold Water
2 tb Oyster Sauce
1 tb Cornstarch
This is the sauce I use on broccoli chicken.  If you want more of a
ginger and garlic taste I would add garlic and ginger in with the
chicken (or whatever meat you are using for the dish).

Wisk the above ingredients together and pour over stir fried chicken
and broccoli.  Pull vegetables up on sides of wok and let sauce
thicken in well of wok (appox. 3 min.). Stir sauce, chicken, and
broccoli together to coat.

Serve.
