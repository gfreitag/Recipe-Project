I had this when visiting friends in N'awlins.  He didn't know the
source of the recipe, but this was sure passable chili. In a large,
heavy pot, brown the meat with the onions and the garlic. Drain off
the fat and stir in the chili powder (depending on quality, you may
want more - we get real cool stuff up here in the north). Add
chilies, tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaves, salt, oregano, vinegar,
and brown sugar.
Cover the pot and cook for 2 hours over low heat.
Add beans and cook, uncovered, 30 minutes more.
Serve with side dishes of corn chips, shredded lettuce, and shredded
Cheddar cheese.
