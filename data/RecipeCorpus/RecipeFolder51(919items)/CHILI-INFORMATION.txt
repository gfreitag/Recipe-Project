-Chilies come in many shapes
-and sizes, but one thing
-they all are....HOT!
-Some are hotter than
-others, some mildly hot,
-but they add excitement to
-a variety of nationalities
-cookery.  Interestingly
-enough, although many
-chilies are sold when they
-are various shades of
-green, yellow, or red,
-they will all turn red if
-left of the vine long
-enough. Major varieties
-include Caribe and Flaoral
-Gem which are yellow
-chilies; Fresno which is
-light gree; Jalapeno, a
-dark green chili: Verde or
-Anaheim, the longer
-shaped green chili which is
-used in preparing chili
-relleno; Pasilla, a
-dark green, pointed chili;
-and the tiniest but hottest
-all, the
-Serrano chili.  Many are
-available all year.
HOW TO CHOOSE AND STORE: Chilies should have bright, shiny skins and
shouldn't be shrivelled. Store in the refrigerator.

BASIC PREPARATION FOR COOKING: In commercial canneries, the tough
though thin skin of the chilies is removed either in a lye bath or in
huge blast furnaces which rush the chilies through and char the
outside skin without harming the meat at all. In the kitchen, though,
thses methods are a bit extreme! There ARE easier ways. If you are
preparing one or two chilies, spear them with a fork and char the
skin over the surface unit of your range. Rotate until the skin is
black or blistered. Put in a small paper sack and close the sack for
a few minutes to let the chilies steam. Slip off the skin. If you are
doing anumber of chilies, here is another method.

BROILER METHOD: Spread chilies on broiler pan under high heat. Turn
chilies frequently until charred or blistered. Put in paper bag for
15-20 minutes. Remove skins, trim off stem and remove all see and
veins. (The seeds are the hottest part of the chili.)

**NOTE OF CAUTION** The juice of chili peppers is not only hot
enought to light a fire in your food, but it can also cause a lot of
discomfort if rubed on the skin. Always remember to wash your hands
thoroughly after cutting or handling chilies. If you have ever
inadvertently rubbed your face or eyes with chili juice on your
hands, you know what we mean! If you're using freshly chopped chilies
in salads, sauces or vegetables, chop them as finely as possible. A
tiny morsel goes a long way.
