Categories: Rice, Native amer
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Wild rice, rinsed in cold
-water
2 1/2 c  Water
1 ts Salt
4    Strips bacon cut into
-julienne strips
1/3 c  Bacon drippings (add melted
-butter to make 1/3 cup)
6    Eggs
1/2 ts Salt

Place the wild rice, water and 1 ts salt in a saucepan, and bring
slowly to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until all water is
absorbed.

Render the bacon in a large heavy skillet. Drain bacon on paper
towels; save drippings.  Add enough melted butter to drippings to
measure 1/3 cup.

Beat eggs, 1/2 ts salt and pepper until light. Pour into skillet in
which you browned the bacon, and brown the eggs slightly. Then turn
gently, as you would a pancake, and brown on the other side. When
eggs are firm, cut into julienne strips. Lightly toss the bacon,
julienne egg strips, chives, bacon drippings plus melted butter with
the rice. Serve hot as a main dish.
