Title: CHINESE EGG DROP SOUP
Categories: None
Yield: 2 Servings
2 c  Chicken Broth
1    Egg (Room Temperature)
Heat the broth in a saucepan until it boils vigorously. Reduce the
heat to a slow simmer (bubbles form and collapse BELOW the surface of
the liquid). Break the egg into a cup and beat very lightly (just
enough to combine yolk and white). Hold the cup in one hand, about 5
inches above the soup, while gently swirling the fork in WIDE circles
in the soup with the other. Slowly pour a thin stream of egg into the
soup, catching the egg with the fork (in the soup) and drawing it
into wide circles in the soup. Interrupt the pouring several times so
as to form several long, filmy threads. Season to taste. Add a
generous squeeze of lemon. Serve immediately. Posted By
