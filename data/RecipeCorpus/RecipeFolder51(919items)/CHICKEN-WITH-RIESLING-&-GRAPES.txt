Title: CHICKEN WITH RIESLING & GRAPES
Categories: Poultry, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 2 Servings
2 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb Olive oil
Whole chicken breast, halved
Shallot, minced
Garlic clove, minced
2 ts All purpose flour
1/3 c  Riesling wine
1/2 c  Chicken broth
2 ts Lemon juice, fresh
1/8 ts Dried thyme, crumbled
1/4 lb Green seedless grapes *
*  halved crosswise (about 3/4 c) In a large skillet, heat the
butter and oil over moderately high heat, until the foam subsides. In
the fat, brown the chicken on all sides for about 8 minutes, or until
it's golden brown. Transfer it with tongs to a plate. Reduce the heat
to moderately low and in the fat remaining in the skillet, cook the
shallot and garlic for about 3 minutes.  Stir in the flour and cook
the roux, stirring, for about 2 minutes.  Add the Riesling and cook
the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the broth, lemon juice,
thyme, and salt/pepper to taste and bring the mixture to a boil,
stirring. Return the chicken to the skillet with any juices from the
plate and simmer the mixture, covered, for 15 minutes. Add the grapes
and simmer the mixture, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5
minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
