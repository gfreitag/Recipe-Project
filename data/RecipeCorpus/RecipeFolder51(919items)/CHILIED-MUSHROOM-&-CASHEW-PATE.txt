In a medium skillet, over a high heat, melt the butter. Saute the
mushrooms 3 to 4 minutes. Add the onion, cook until translucent then
add the garlic for a minute or so, then the spices. Cook until the
mixture is fairly dry. Cool. In a food processor fitted with a metal
blade or blender, chop the cashews finely and slowly; add the oil to
make a paste. Add the mushroom mixture and continue mixing until
smooth. Taste and add more chile powder or salt, if necessary. Place
in a serving bowl and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve at room
temperature. Yield: about 3 1/2 cups Copyright, 1996, TV FOOD
