Title: CHINESE STYLE BREWED TOFU.
Categories: Chinese, Pork, Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
1 md Firm tofu (carefully
Sliced into 1/2 inch
Cubes)
1/4 c  Ground pork
(or ground beef)
3 tb Vegetable oil
2 tb Soybean sauce
1/2 tb Granulated sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Chopped green onion
1/2 tb Chopped garlic
1 1/2 c  Water (or unsalted
Chicken broth)
(optional). mixture of
1/2ts cornstarch and 1Tb
Cold water
step 1. heat the oil on the fry pan. 2. add in ground pork, stir fry
them until cooked (lightly brown) 3. scoop ground pork to one edge of
the fry pan, and add chopped garlics 4. stir fry garlic and ground
pork few times and then add soybean sauce, sugar, and salt to taste(I
prefer not to add too much) 5. careful slide the tofu cubes into the
fry pan. Tofu is fragile, so after they are set into the pan, DONT
stir fry them. if you really need to move them, PUSH them tenderly by
the flat side of the spoon. 6. add water to boil to 10 min. (close
the lid on and simmer, and I prefer a longer time to 20 minutes if I
am not in a hurry) 7. now you can smell how good it is to cook with
soybean sauce and sugar in chinese food, after the tofu cubes absorb
the sauces and are done, spread over the mixture of cornstarch and
cold water and heat up to boil again until the sauce becomes a little
bit thick, 8. sprinkle the chopped green onion and ready to serve. be
careful to PUSH or scoop the tofu to the serving plate, you dont want
to smash the tofu cubes and let the savory sauces come out of them.:>
THis dish goes greatly with rice.
