Categories: Info, Kooknet
Yield: 1 Info  To roast chile peppers: Cut a slit near the stem of each chile pepper.

Skewer chile peppers and sear over an open flame, 6" to 10" from
heat. Turn chilies, until blistered all over (if not removing skin)
or until slightly burned, but not blackened (if removing skin), about
8 minutes. Or place chilies on a grilling rack or baking sheet and
broil in oven 4" from heat for about 8 minutes.

If not removing skin, cool, chop and use immediately.

If removing skin, place chilies in an airtight container or paper
bag. Seal and let sweat for 20 minutes. When cool enough to handle,
remove chilies one by one and slip off skins or peel with a paring
knife.

To prepare chilies for stuffing: Roast and peel chile peppers as
directed above. Cut a circle around the stem and detach the core with
the seeds. Carefully scrape out any remaining seeds.

To remove some of the heat from a chile pepper: Wash the chile and
cut it lengthwise. Remove the seeds and ribs, where heat-producing
capsium is most concentrated.

Soak the chile flesh in an equal mixture of cold water and vinegar
before using.

To remove some of the heat from a chile papper recipe: For simmering
dishes, cut a few slits in a whole chile, skewer it on a toothpick
and add it to the dish while cooking. Remove and discard the chile
before serving.
