Categories: Chinese, Chicken
Yield: 4 Servings
MMMMM--------------------------CHICKEN-------------------------------
8    Chicken breasts, boned and
- skinned
1 c  Slivered almonds
1 bn Chives
4    Garlic cloves; finely minced
1 tb Finely minced fresh ginger
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
2 ts Grated lemon peel, or:
- finely minced lemon peel
1/2 c  Lemon juice
6 tb Sugar
1/4 c  Chicken broth
2 tb Light soy sauce
1/2 ts Salt
MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
2 tb Cornstarch
1/4 c  Cooking oil
Salt and pepper
1 c  All-purpose flour
4 tb Unsalted butter
ADVANCE PREPARATION: Dip each chicken breast in water and then gently
flatten with a meat pounder or rolling pin until the breast increases
in size by about one-third. Set aside. Toast the almonds in a 325 F
oven until light golden, then set aside. Mince the chives and set
aside. Combine the garlic and ginger and set aside. In a small bowl
combine the sauce ingredients and mix well. LAST-MINUTE COOKING:
Combine the cornstarch with an equal amount of cold water. Preheat
the oven to warm. Place a small noncorrosive skillet or saucepan over
medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon cooking oil and then garlic and ginger.
Saute briefly, then add the sauce. Bring to a low boil and reduce the
heat to simmer. Sprinkle the chicken on both sides with a little salt
and pepper. Dust with flour, shaking off any excess. Place a 12-inch
skillet over high heat. When hot, add the butter and remaining 3
tablespoons of oil. When the butter bubbles, pan-fry 3 or 4 chicken
pieces at a time. Cook for about 1 minute on each side. The chicken
is done when the meat turns color and feels firm to the touch (do not
overcook).  Transfer the chicken to a heated platter or dinner plates
and keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining chicken. Bring
the sauce back to a low boil and stir in a little of the cornstarch
mixture to lightly thicken it. Spoon the sauce over the chicken.
Sprinkle the almonds and chives on top.  Serve at once.
