Categories: Indonesian, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 lb Squid
1/2 c  Diced onion
2    Cloves garlic, minced
3    Or 4 semi-hot fresh red
-chiles, minced, or 1
-teaspoon sambal ulek
1/2 ts Kosher salt
2 tb Oil
1 ts Paprika, if needed
2 tb Tamarind Water or lemon
-juice
In its most authentic form, this sambal is bright red with chile and
quite hot.  If you prefer it a little milder, use fresh chiles that
are not too hot, such as the milder strain of jalapenos now on the
market; otherwise, use less chile and make up the color difference
with paprika.

[Personally, I'd use crushed and soaked annatto seeds. They add red
color without the paprika taste.  S.C.]

1.  Clean squid.  Remove purplish outer skin and cut sacs into rings.

2.  To prepare in a mortar:  Pound onion, garlic, chiles, and salt
together to a coarse paste.  To prepare in a blender or food
processor: Grind together with oil.

3.  In a wok or skillet, heat oil over low heat and add paste. (If
oil was used in grinding paste, add paste to dry pan.) Cook slowly
until quite fragrant and oil is well stained with red. Add paprika if
necessary to enhance color.

4.  Turn heat to medium-high, add squid and Tamarind Water, and cook
just until squid is done (about 2 minutes). Serve hot or at room
temperature.

Serves 4 to 6 with other dishes.
