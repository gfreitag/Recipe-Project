Title: CHICKKEN A LA MYRNA
Categories: Main dish, Chicken, Casserole
Yield: 4 Servings
-GRAMMIE'S KITCHEN
1    Chicken; cut up
1 c  Cream of mushroom soup
1 pk Onion soup mix
1/2 c  Dry sherry
1 cn Mushrooms; (small) or fresh
MIX EVERYTHING TOGETHER and pour over the chicken. Bake at 350
degrees for about an hour.  You can do almost anything to this recipe
that you like. I.E., leave out the mushrooms, use fresh, change the
cream of soup to another flavor, use another wine or leave out . You
can also use chicken parts and take off the skin. If you use the same
concoction over a pot roast it will taste completely different. Cover
the pot roast when you bake;  chicken bakes uncovered.  ( Forgot to
say that) Anyway enjoy,

This recipe was given to me about 25 years ago by Auntie Myrna
Waltzer. We first had it at her house. Its great for quick meals and
for camping. You can use this with the foil technique over a fire.
Change the flavor of the soup and you change  the dish.
