Place chicken in pot, cover with water. Bring to boil, simmer 20
minutes. Remove, drain on paper towels. Place vegetable oil in
deep-fryer, heat to 350 F. Test for readiness by dropping a rice
noodle into oil. If it sinks, oil isn't hot enough. When it pops up
immediately, put in dough strips, fry to a light tan color. Remove
and drain on paper towels. Divide noodles into 3 parts, deep-fry
separately. Noodles should explode on contact with hot oil & should
be removed instantly, before oil is absorbed. Drain on paper towels.

Deep-fry chicken 5 minutes.  Remove, drain on paper towels. Bone, cut
into strips, including skin. Place chicken meat in large bowl. Add
mustard, five-spice powder, sesame oil, soy sauce, almonds, green
onions, & salt.

Mix well. Add crisp-fried wonton strips & noodles; mix well. They'll
break. Pile salad on bed of lettuce, don't toss.
