Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 Servings
2/3 c  Sunflower seeds, hulled
-- & raw, optional
2 c  Chickpeas, cooked
1 c  Couscous
1/2 c  Tomato juice
1/2 c  Red wine, dry
3 tb Soy sauce

2 tb Red wine vinegar
2 ts Rosemary
1 ts Thyme

1/2 tb Olive oil
If using sunflower seeds, preheat oven to 350F. Spread seeds on baking
tray. Remove any shells or discolored seeds. Bake 5-7 mins, until
seeds smell nutty and darken slightly. Grind in food processor until
coarsely chopped. Add chickpeas and process until well mixed. Keep
mix in food processor. In heavy pot, combine couscous, tomato juice
and red wine. Stir and bring to a boil.  Lower heat, cover and simmer
2-3 mins, until couscous has absorbed all the liquid. Let stand 5
more mins. Add cooked couscous to chickpea mixture along with
remaining ingredients except oil. Mix well, stopping processor and
scraping down the sides once or twice, until smooth. Lightly oil your
hands.  Shape 2-3 tb of chickpea mixture between your hands to form a
ball. Repeat with remaining mixture until you have 24 balls. Flatten
balls to form patties about 2 inches wide and
1/2    inch thick. Brush croquettes with olive oil and place on
lightly oiled baking tray. Bake 15 mins, turn croquettes over, brush
with oil and bake another 10-12 mins. You can bake croquettes ahead
of time, refrigerate and reheat before serving. Serve with Sauce
