Saute vegetables in butter until almost soft.  Cut chicken into bite
size chucks.  Season chicken with five spice powder sparingly. Add
chicken and mushrooms. Stir fry on high heat very fast, until chicken
is done. Turn down heat. Then add apple cider, soy sauce and
pineapple juice. Can add more soy sauce and pineapple if needed. Add
sugar. Mix cornstarch and water together and add and turn on very
high heat until thickens. Can add just a very little pinch of five
spice to mixture, but be careful with five spice. It's very strong.
To make lower fat, can saute vegetables with 1/2 margarine and 1/2
chicken broth. Can make lower in Sodium if use low sodium soy sauce.
When seasoning chicken breasts, use five spice sparingly. Toss with
noodles.
