Title: CHICKEN WITH HAM & PROVALONE CHEESE
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
3    Whole chicken breasts
9    Slices cured Polish ham
2 1/2 tb Seedless raspberry jam
1 1/2 c  Uncooked rice
3 c  Water
1 1/2 lb Broccoli
7    Slices provalone cheese
Use vegetable oil or cooking spray to lightly grease a large baking
dish. (I used a 9x12" cake tin.)  Remove the broccoli heads from the
stems. Trim the stems, slice and chop coarsely like celery. Put the
rice and the chopped broccoli stems in the bottom of the baking dish.
Spread the ham slices with raspberry jam and wrap them (raspberry
side down) around all sides of each chicken breast. Arrange the
chicken breasts down the center of the dish, break the broccoli head
into pieces and place around the chicken.  Add 3 c. water.

Cover and bake 45 min. at 350'F.  Remove dish from oven (to check
chicken for doneness, cut into it with a knife or fork -- meat should
be white, juices should run clear), cover chicken breasts with slices
of cheese and put additional pieces of cheese over the rice and
broccoli, then return to oven and bake uncovered another 5-10 min.
until cheese is melted. It will look & smell wonderful!  Split
chicken breasts to serve 4-6.

I suppose this is similar to chicken cordon bleu (?), but it seemed
much easier than stuffing deboned chicken breasts, and the rice and
broccoli are delicious cooked this way.  I didn't add salt, pepper,
or other seasonings because the ham I used was so delicious and
strongly flavored; use your judgement. Asparagus and/or mushrooms
would probably be good substitutes for the broccoli.  I liked the
subtle flavor added by the raspberry jam, which was not too sweet;
probably you could substitute another jam or a small amount of honey.
