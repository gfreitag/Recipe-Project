Title: CHILAQUILES (PRODIGY)
Categories: Breakfast, Cheese
Yield: 4 Servings
6    Eggs
4    Corn tortillas
2    Avocados
2    Tomatoes
4 tb Lime juice
4 ts Olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tb Butter or margarine
2    Onions; finely diced
1 c  Cooked beef, chicken or pork
- (diced or shredded)
1 ts Chili powder
1/2 ts Ground cumin
Cilantro
BREAK THE EGGS in a mixing bowl and beat them lightly. Cut the
tortillas into eighths and add to the eggs. Let sit 15 minutes. Cut
the avocados in half from tip to stem, and remove the pit. Using a
paring knife, slice the flesh in each half from tip to stem in
1/2-inch slices without cutting through skin. Using a large spoon,
scoop the flesh out of the skin in 1 piece. Lay cut side down on each
plate and fan out the slices. Cut the tomatoes into slices and lay
slices next to the avocado. Drizzle with lime juice and oil, and
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a large skillet
over medium heat and add the onion, chili powder and cumin. Cook,
stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add meat; cook just until warmed.
Add the beaten eggs and tortillas and cook, stirring, until eggs are
cooked to desired doneness. Arrange a mound of eggs on each plate
next to the avocado and tomato. Garnish with some cilantro. Serve
immediately.
