1/2 c  Carrots, chopped
10    Napa cabbage leaves, chopped
-and ends removed
2    Stalks bok choi, chopped
4 c  Fresh bean sprouts
1/2 md Onion, chopped
4    Cloves garlic, minced
1/2 c  Bamboo shoots, chopped
1 c  Water chestnuts, chopped
1 lb Ground pork, cooked
1 lb Small shrimp, cooked
1/2 lb Ground beef, cooked
1/4 c  Cooking wine
1/4 c  Soy sauce
3 tb Sesame oil
1 pk Egg roll skins or wrappers
Oil for frying
1    Egg, beaten
Mix filling ingredients together. Put mixture in the freezer awhile to
cool. Warm meat tends to soften the wrappers and make things messy.

Heat vegetable oil in fryer to 325 degrees.

To roll, place about 3 tb filling mixture in the center of the
wrapper. Fold 1 corner over mixture and fold in ends. Continue
rolling. Brush egg mixture on exposed corner of wrapper to help seal
egg roll.

Put egg rolls in hot oil, a few at a time, and fry a few minutes on
each side until golden brown. Remove to drain on paper towels. Serve
warm with soy sauce, hot mustard, or sauce of your choice. Makes 18
egg rolls.
