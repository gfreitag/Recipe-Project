Firefighters cookbook, compiled by John Sineno, one of New York's
bravest and well fed!! Brown sausage, ground meat, onion, and garlic

cover, and simmer 1 1/4 hours.  After cooking time is up, add the
beans and stir. Top with grated Monterey Jack cheese and finely
chopped scallions. FROM: THOMAS BROWN
