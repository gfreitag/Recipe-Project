Title: CHINESE BBQ PORK
Categories: Pork, Chinese
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Boneless pork shoulder, cut
-into 8"x2-1/2"x1/2" pieces
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
5 ts Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
2    Garlic cloves, minced
1 ts Ginger juice
4 tb Ketchup
4 tb Soy sauce
5 ts White wine
1 ts Five spice powder
MMMMM-----------------------BASTING SAUCE----------------------------
1 tb Hoisin sauce
1/4 c  Honey
Marinate pork for 2-4 hours, or overnight if you wish. Preheat oven
to 375F and place marinated pork on a rack over a roasting pan filled
with 1 cup of water. Bake for 20 minutes, basting occasionally with
remaining marinade. Turn and bake another 20 minutes.

Take pan out of oven, swich oven to broil.  Baste both sides of pork
with basting sauce and broil for 1 minute on each side.

Let pork cool and cut into thin slices.  Serve hot or cold. Keep in
tightly sealed container in refrigerator or in freezer if not served
right away. Reheat with a little water in roasting pan, or wrap in
foil.

Notes:  Let the meat marinade at least 8 hours - you will get a much
more tender result.  Make extra, it's really good... We serve it cold
on a plate with pickled ginger and green onion flowers as a starter
to a Chinese meal. Or add it to 'La Choy' frozen wonton soup along
with some green onion, and slivered vegetables for a 'homemade' look.
