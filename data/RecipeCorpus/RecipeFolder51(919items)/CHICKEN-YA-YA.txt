Title: CHICKEN YA YA
Categories: Cajun, Low-cal, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
1    2 1/2-3 lb chicken skinned a
1/2 ts Red pepper
1/2 ts Paprika
1 c  Finely chopped onions
1/2 c  Finely chopped celery
2 tb Tomato paste
1 tb Low sodium Worcesterschire
1/4 ts Ground ginger
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Chili powder
1 tb Reduced calorie margarine
1/2 c  Finely chopped bell pepper
1    6 oz can orange juice
2 tb Honey
1 ts Grated orange peel
1/4 ts Hot sauce
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the chicken halves in an
eight inch baking dish sprayed with vegetable cooking spray. Combine
the salt, red pepper, chili powder and paprika; mix well and sprinkle
over the chicken;  set aside.

In a medium skillet over high heat, melt the margarine. Add the
onions, bell pepper and celery; saute, stirring constantly for five
minutes. Add all the remaining ingredients. Cook, constantly
stirring, for five more minutes, or until thge sauce thickens, then
remove from the heat and pour over the chicken. Cover with aluminum
foil and bake for 30 minutes. Turn the chicken over and baste with
the sauce.  Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes longer, or until the
chicken is tender, basting often.

note:  Rather than use margarine to saute the vegetables, I have used
Pam, spraying both the vegetables and the pan. Works just as well.
Also, for a little spicier dish, try using Chinese red pepper instead
of the ground red and use a Tbsp of hot sauce. I also usually leave
out the ginger.
