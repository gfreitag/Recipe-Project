1    To 2 T chopped fresh
Cilantro (see note)
1/4 c  Tomatillo (green) taco

Garlic, minced

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Put rice on to cook. Mix yogurt with
cilantro and taco sauce. Set aside. "Saute" onions and garlic in wine
till soft.

In a casserole dish spritzed with PAM layer: corn, cooked rice,
olives, zucchini, onion/garlic. Pour beans over all. Cover and cook
in 350 oven for 30 minutes or until heated thoroughly.

Sprinkle tomatoes over top and drizzle with yogurt mixture. Serve.

Notes:

Buy fresh cilantro, wash, dry completely, chop and freeze spread out
on a piece of wax paper. Store in a zip lock baggie and then you can
have fresh cilantro anytime.

I bought the grocery store brand of "Mexican style chili beans." They
have little/no fat in them.

Variations: scallions: shredded lettuce on top with tomato, mushrooms
sauted with onions, etc.

restaurant. The measurements are flexible
