Title: CHILLI SAUCE
Categories: Hot, Sauce, Relishes, Condiments
Yield: 1 Bottle
4 c  Apples (green)
1 1/2 c  Chilli
2 c  Sugar
4    Onions
1 tb Salt
3/4 c  Vinegar (white) or brown
Chop onions finely also chillies and apples.  Add all other
ingredients. Cook until tender -  simmer gently. To make a hotter
sauce leave seeds in chillies. Suggest using the hot chillies about
4cm long. I made some with hot mex chillies and left the seeds
in---WOW -- Doug likes it like that. I also halfed the sugar as he
thought it was too sweet. Also I put Chillie onion and apple through
food processor one ingredient at a time, it makes cooking faster and
you get a wetter end product. About 20 min. cooking.
