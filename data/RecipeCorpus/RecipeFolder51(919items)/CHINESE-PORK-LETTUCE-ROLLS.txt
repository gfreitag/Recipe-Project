Categories: Pork
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Heads Boston lettuce
Dried Chinese mushrooms --
6    8 mushrooms
8 oz Waterchestnuts -- canned
1/2 c  Bamboo shoots
1 lb Ground pork
1    Egg
1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
4 ts Cornstarch
2 tb Dry sherry
3/4 c  Chicken broth
1/2 ts Salt -- to taste
1/4 c  Corn oil
1 c  Celery -- minced
1. Black mushrooms are optional. If using, soak in boiling water for
30 minutes, drain, cut off stems, and chop. 2. Wash lettuce, dry, and
arrange 16-20 of the largest leaves on a serving plate, then
refrigerate. Use head lettuce if Boston lettuce is not available. 3.
Mince the waterchestnuts and bamboo shoots; add to drained mushrooms.
Set aside. 4. Mix together the pork, slightly beaten egg, soy sauce
and 3 teaspoons (1 tablespoon) of the cornstarch. Set aside. 5.
Combine sherry, 1/2 cup broth and salt. Add remaining 1 teaspoon
cornstarch to the remaining 1/3 cup broth, blend well. 6. Heat a wok
or heavy skillet; add oil to the hot skillet. Add pork mixture and
cook, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes. 8. Add mushroom mixture;
cook, stirring constantly, 2 minutes. 9. Stir in wine mixture and the
cornstarch mixture. 10. Add celery and stir until celery is heated
through. If celery is minced fine enough, it won't need any further
cooking time. 11. Place meat on a serving dish. To serve, let each
guest fill a lettuce leaf with pork and roll the leaf. This is to be
eaten with the fingers.
