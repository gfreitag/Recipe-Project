Title: CHILEAN SWEETCORN PARCELS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 3 Servings
8 lg Chinese leaves
400 g  Canned sweetcorn; drained
4    Milk (4-5 tbs)
2    Eggs, beaten
2 tb Finely chopped fresh herbs
- (e.g. marjoram, basil,
- coriander, etc.)
Pepper to taste
Serves 3-4

This recipe was given to me by a friend who lived in Chile for several
years, and it has become a firm favourite. A sweetcorn paste tasting
of fresh herbs is poached inside a wrapping of Chinese leaves. A
delicious supper dish. Serve on rice or with noodles.

Steam the Chinese leaves for a minute or two until supple but not too
soft. Liquidize all the rest of the ingredients together to a paste.
Divide the mixture into eight and put spoonfuls into the centre of
each leaf. Wrap up like a spring-roll, with the ends folded in, and
secure with a wooden cocktail stick. Steam over hot water for 20-25
minutes until the filling is set.
