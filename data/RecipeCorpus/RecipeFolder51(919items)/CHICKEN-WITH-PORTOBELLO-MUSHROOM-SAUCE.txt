Recipe by: Food & Wine Jan-96 1. Preheat oven to 425F. Arrange the
mushrooms, stemmed side down on a baking sheet. Brush the mushrooms
with 1 teaspoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for
about 12 minutes or until tender. Thinly slice the mushrooms and
transfer to a plate.

2.  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet.
Season the chicken breasts wiith salt and pepper and add half the
breasts to the skillet, skin side down. Cook over moderately high
heat, turning once, until well browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to
a plate and repeat the process with the remaining breasts. Pour off
the fat from the skillet. Return all the chicken to the skillet,
lower the heat to moderate, cover and cook until opaque throughout,
about 5 minutes longer. Transfer the chicken to a large plate and
keep warm.

3.  Add the white wine to the skillet and boil over high heat,
stirring to scrape up any browned bits, until reduced by half, about
5 minutes. Add the chicken stock and reduce by half, about 3 minutes.
Add the cream and continue boiling until reduced by half, about 3
more minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper.
Set each chicken breast on a large plate and spoon the sauce over and
serve.
