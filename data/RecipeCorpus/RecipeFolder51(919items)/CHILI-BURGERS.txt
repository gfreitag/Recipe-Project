While gorund turkey and ground lamb give new excitement to burgers,
beef is still the meat of choice for Chili Burgers. (Use a light
touch when mixing beef with other ingredients. If you overmix, the
burgers will be too dense in texture.) Fresh lemon zest and dill add
a bright flavor to the robust chili spices. Garnishes are optional,
but it's fun to serve burgers with all of your favorite chili
toppings.

1. Prepare hot coals for grilling.

2. Place beef in a bowl and mix well with the tomato, olives, garlic,
mustard, chili powder, basil, oregano, lemon zest and dill. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. Gently form the mixture into 4 patties.

3. Grill the burgers over hot coals, 3" from heat, for about 4
minutes per side for rare meat.

4. Serve immediately on buns. If desired, top with sour cream, sliced
scallions and grated Monterey Jack cheese.
