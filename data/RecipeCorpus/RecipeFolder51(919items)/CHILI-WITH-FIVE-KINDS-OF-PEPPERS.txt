Yield: 1 Servings
1    Big jalapeno
2    Cuban frying peppers
1    Hot hungarian,

1 c  Dried black beans
1 c  Dried pinto beans

2    Onions (white and yellow?)
3    Garlic cloves
x  Tomatoes (3 big beefsteak or
About 8 roma)
x  Cumin, coriander, oregano,
Salt, pepper to taste

Soak the beans overnight, then simmer until tender (1 to 2 hours) I
tend to add some seaweed while cooking (dump in a bowl so you can use
the bean pot for frying) roast the cumin in a frying pan (optional,
but valuable) I used about 2 to 3 tsp chop onions and garlic, saute
in oil chop peppers, saute with onion & garlic add chopped tomatoes,
cook a until soft Add the beans, and some bean liquid Add the spices
and cook for another hour or so
