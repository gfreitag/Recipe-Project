Title: GINSENG SHREDS STIR RICE - FOR A SPECIAL MEAL
Categories: Chinese, Rice, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
9 c  Pre steamed rice
2    Ounces finely chopped
-Ginseng
2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 ts Salt
3    Onions shredded
3    Sweet peppers shredded
1 lb Celery
Steam and simmer rice.  Use 1 heaping tablespoon vegetable oil and
stir rice in a skillet over a big fire for 1 or 2 minutes. Take out
the rice.

Heat the remaining vegetable oil over a big fire until hot. Put in
finely chopped Ginseng, onions, peppers, celery and salt and stir for
2 minutes. Let sit, covered, for 7 minutes. Then it's ready.

Almost all Chinese soups and stews are adaptable to Ginseng, with the
exception of those having citrus fruits as an ingredient. I've given
you a start here, but experiment. Dig up a Chinese cookbook and try
out a few recipes.
