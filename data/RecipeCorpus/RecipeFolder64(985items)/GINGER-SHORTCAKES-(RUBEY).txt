Title: GINGER SHORTCAKES (RUBEY)
Categories: Jane, Rubey
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  White all-purpose flour
1/4 c  White sugar
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Ground ginger
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
1/4 c  Molasses
1/2 c  Nonfat milk
1 tb White sugar
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In food processor, blend together
flour, sugar, baking powder, soda, salt and ginger. Cut butter into
bits and add to processor. Pulse several times until mixture
resembles coarse meal. Add molasses and milk and mix briefly until
mixture forms a ball. Turn onto lightly floured board and pat flat,
about 1-inch thick. Cut into six 3-inch rounds (an empty can works
nicely). Place on lightly spray-greased baking sheet. Sprinkle tops
with sugar. Bake in preheated oven about 15 to 18 minutes. Cool on
rack. (Can be served slightly warm.) Using your fingers, split each
shortcake into 2 3-inch rounds. Top bottom half with 1/6 of the
Peaches and Cream. Place top half of shortcake over the filling.
Repeat for remaining servings.
