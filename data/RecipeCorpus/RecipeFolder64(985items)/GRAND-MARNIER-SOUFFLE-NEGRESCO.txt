Title: GRAND MARNIER SOUFFLE NEGRESCO
Categories: Eggs
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Egg yolks
1/3 c  Sugar
1 c  Heavy cream
3    Egg whites
Few drops of lemon juice
1/3 c  Grand Marnier
1.  In a large bowl, combine the egg yolks and half the sugar; beat
until
very thick and light in color. 2. In a medium bowl, whip the cream
until it holds in soft peaks. Set
aside. 3. In another medium bowl, beat the egg whites with the
lemon juice until
foamy.  Gradually add the remaining sugar while continuing to beat
until firm but still glossy. 4. Stir the Grand Marnier into the
egg yolks.  Gently fold in the whipped
cream, then fold in the egg whites. 5. Spoon the mixture into 6
individual souffle molds, leveling off the
tops.  Make collars by folding sheets of aluminum foil into strips
and wrapping the stips around the molds.  The upper edges of the
strips should be about 1 inch above the tops of the molds. Secure
with string.  Fill molds to top of collar.  Cover with plastic
wrap and freeze. 6. Serve either in the molds, with the foil
collar removed, to unmolded
onto chilled dessert plates. ~--
