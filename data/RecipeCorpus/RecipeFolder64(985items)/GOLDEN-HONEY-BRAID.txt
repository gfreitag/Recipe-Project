Title: GOLDEN HONEY BRAID
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2    To 3/4 cup warm water
4 tb Honey
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/8 ts Ground saffron, optional
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Golden raisins, optional
Honey
Makes 1 loaf

Combine 1/4 cup of the water, 1 tablespoon of the honey, yeast and
saffron, if desired.  Stir to dissolve yeast and let stand until
bubbly, about 5 minutes.

Fit processor with steel blade.  Measure flour, oil, remaining 3
tablespoons of the honey and salt into work bowl. Process until mixed,
about 15 seconds.

Add yeast mixture to flour mixture.  Process until blended, about 10
seconds.

Turn on processor and very slowly drizzle just enough remaining water
through feed tube into flour mixture so dough forms a ball that
cleans the sides of the bowl. Process until ball turns around bowl
about 25 times. Turn off processor and let dough stand 1 to 2 minutes.

Turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough remaining water to
make dough soft, smooth and satiny but not sticky. Process until
dough turns around bowl about 15 times.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface.  Knead raisins into dough, if
desired.  Shape into ball and place in lightly greased bowl, turning
to grease all sides. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in
warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough.  Divide dough into 3 equal parts. Shape each part
into strand 20 inches long.  Braid strands loosely together and place
on greased cookie sheet or in greased 2 quart ring mold or tube pan.
Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in warm place until
almost doubled, about 45 minutes.

Heat oven to 350 F.  Bake until golden and loaf sounds hollow when
tapped, 30 - 40 minutes.

Remove immediately from cookie sheet or pan and place on wire rack.
Brush honey over crust.  Cool.
