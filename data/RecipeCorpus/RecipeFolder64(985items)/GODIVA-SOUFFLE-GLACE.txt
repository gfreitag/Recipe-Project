Title: GODIVA SOUFFLE GLACE
Categories: Chocolate, Godiva
Yield: 8 Servings
8    Eggs
1 c  Sugar
1 tb Instant Coffee Granules
2 tb Cocoa Powder
1 ts Vanilla Extract
1/2 c  Godiva Liqueur
3 1/2 c  Heavy Cream
Shaved Chocolate
Fold waxed or parchment paper pieces lengthwise, spray with vegetable
coating, and secure around eight 4 oz. souffle dishes to make 2in
standing collars. In a stainless steel bowl over simmering water,
whip the eggs, sugar, coffee and cocoa powder until mixture is
thickened and hangs in the hoop of a wire whip.

Remove from heat, add vanilla extract and Godiva Liqueur and cool.
Whip the cream until stiff and fold into the eggs in four batches.
Divide the mixture among six greased souffle dishes, allowing for a
one inch extension over the top of each dish, and place immediately
in the freezer. If enough mixture remains, use to fill the remaining
souffli dishes and freeze as well. To serve, remove the collars and
garnish with shaved chocolate. webmaster@godiva.  com
