Yield: 1 Recipe
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
8 c  Flour
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/2 pt Sour cream
2 c  Milk (about); scalded
2 oz Yeast
3    Egg yolks; beaten
1/4 lb Sweet butter
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 1/2 lb Ground nuts
1 tb Honey
3    Egg whites
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Heavy milk or cream
1/3 c  Sweet butter
DOUGH: Dissolve yeast in about 2 teaspoons sugar and 1/2 cup warm
water; let stand until it bubbles.  Sift flour in large bowl and add
salt and 1/2 cup sugar. In another bowl beat 3 egg yolks, 1 teaspoon
vanilla and sour cream; add yeast; add scalded milk and sweet butter
which was added to the milk and cooled.  Add this to the flour bowl
and knead to a soft silky dough, not sticky.  Let rise in a greased
bowl until double in bulk. Make sure the dough is soft as it has to
stretch.

On floured cloth roll dough to about 1/4 to 1/2 inch in thickness;
stretch gently so it won't break. Stretch oblone bout 30 x 20 inches
(use rolling pin if necessary) and fill with following filling.

FILLING: Scald milkj with butter.  In bowl add ground nuts, honey,
vanilla, sugar and scant of salt (that's what it says! -KM), then add
scaled milk with butter. Mix, then add stiffly beaten egg whites. If
thick, add a little more milk.  Spread on dough like you would for
nut roll and roll like a jelly roll (make as sweet as desired).
Grease roasting pan 4 to 6 inches in depth and fill pan; start at one
edge of pan; make a "U" shape. Do not cut if roll is longer; turn
again. Brush with milk. Prick with knife on top for air bubbles. Let
stand 1 hour. Bake at 350 F for 1 hour. Take out and brush with
butter. Let cool, then flop it on a cloth and place it on a rack to
cool.
