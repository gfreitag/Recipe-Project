Title: GORGEOUS SALAD W/DRIED TOMATOES
Categories: Digest
Yield: 1 Servings
-Big salad bowl (12"
-diameter?) filled with
-equal parts escarolle and
-romaine
1/2 c  Or more roasted red peppers,
-bite sized pieces
1/4    -1/2 cup dried tomatoes
2 tb Balsamic vinegar to taste
1    To 2 tablespoons raisins
1 tb LF parmesean, if you can
-find some that's decent!
1    Thin-sliced green onion
Toss!  Munch!  Nice with a piece of multi-grain toast and/or a cup of
miso soup.

I think when I make this for company I'll use both red and yellow
peppers to roast. Last night I tried some Mazetti's (sp?) roasted red
peppers, which are packed without oil. Also, you would never have
gotten me to mix raisins with anything savory a few months ago, but
this really is good!
