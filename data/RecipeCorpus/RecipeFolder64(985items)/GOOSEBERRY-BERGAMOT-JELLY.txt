Title: GOOSEBERRY BERGAMOT JELLY
Categories: Jellies, Fruits, Salt-free
Yield: 8 Half pints
4 qt Fresh gooseberries
3    Heaping handfuls of chopped
1 c  Chopped bergamot leaves,
-tightly packed
12 oz White sugar per pint juice
Wash and sort gooseberries.  Place in a large enamelled pot and crush
berries. Add chopped bergamot leaves.  Add enough water to cover and
simmer until soft, then pour into a clean jelly bag.  Let drip
overnight.

Measure the juice and add the sugar.  Stir over a low heat to
dissolve the sugar, then bring to a rolling boil.  Boil until jelly
sheets on a spoon. Skim if a skin forms on the surface.  Pour into
hot sterilized jars and seal.

The bergamot is not the European bergamot, but rather the North
American herb, Monarda didyma, and related species.

This is my own tried and true recipe, so please enjoy it.
