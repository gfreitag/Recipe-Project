2 qt Water
1/2 lb Ground pure beef suet
1 lg Sweet onion; finely chopped
2 lb Lean beef
- coarse ground or 1/4" cube
6 tb Chili powder or to taste

* = Can substitute 2 - 15 1/2 oz. cans each, pinto beans and 2 quarts
water.

Soak dry beans in water to cover overnight; drain. Add 2 quarts water;
simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until done. Drain, reserving
1 cup of cooking liquid; set aside. In large 3 quart Dutch oven or
heavy kettle, melt suet.  Add onion; saute over medium heat until
transparent. Add meat and brown, stirring often. Drain all but 2
Tbsp. of drippings; add seasonings, cocoa and chilies.  Cover; simmer
for 1 1/2 hours, stirring often.  Add tomato juice to keep chili to a
medium consistency. If a thinner chili is desired, use reserved bean
juice. To serve, add warm pinto beans to chili or serve as a side
dish.  Add a dollop of sour cream on each bowl.  This is a spicy,
meaty chili.
