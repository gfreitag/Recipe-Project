The Riverside Park in the historic little southeast Iowa town of
Bentonsport is where Jane Dooley of Fairfield, Iowa, and her family
gathers for summer reunions. Her chicken and vegetables steam on the
grill in easy-to-serve foil packets.

1.  Place each chicken breast on an 18-inch square piece of heavy-duty
foil.

2.  Divide all vegetables among foil packages and season with some
salt
and pepper.  Drizzle with some apple juice.  Seal foil well,
leaving
room for steam.

3.  Place directly over medium-hot coals.  Grill 20 to
25    minutes, turning
once, till chicken is done and vegetables are tender. Open
packets to
serve.  Drizzle with preserves, if you like.

Picnic Hint:  Assemble chicken-filled packets at home, and transport
them to the picnic site in a cooler filled with ice. To melt
preserves, place in a heavy-duty plastic container and set it in the
sun on your car's dash or back window.  Or place in metal bowl off to
the side on the grill till melted.
