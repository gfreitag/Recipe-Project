Title: GOLDEN COURGETTES WITH CHEESE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 2 Servings
1 md Onion; chopped
2 tb Oil
1    Pinch of saffron
450 g  Yellow courgettes, sliced
100 g  Cheddar, grated
2    Eggs; beaten
Salt and pepper
Serves 2-3

The golden colour of this dish is as appetizing as its flavours -
saffron adding its gold to the yellowness of the courgettes. The dish
is delectable with new potatoes and a leafy side-salad.

Soften the onion in the oil over a very gentle heat, covered, for
about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time. Add the saffron and
season to taste with salt and pepper. Steam the courgette slices
until tender. Mix the two together and place in a baking-dish. Add
the cheese to the beaten eggs and season with salt and pepper. Pour
over the vegetables and bake at 190 degrees C / 375 degrees F / gas 5
for 20 minutes, until the topping is risen and set.
