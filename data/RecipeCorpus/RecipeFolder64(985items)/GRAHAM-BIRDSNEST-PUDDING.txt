Title: GRAHAM BIRDSNEST PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
Apples
Flour
1 c  Milk; sour
1/2 c  Sugar
1/3 ts Baking soda
Lay in a deep dish, nice quartered apples, and pour over them a thin
batter made of flour, one teacup of sour milk, one-half cup of sugar
and about one third of a teaspoon of soda. Bake in a moderate oven
till the apples are thoroughly cooked.

Baked in the manner of a fruit cobbler, we assume this apple dish was
made with graham, or whole wheat flour, although white flour was
plentiful by 1861 and was preferred for dessert recipes. The quaint
name may have referred to its appearance and could have prompted
California Farmer to publish it.
