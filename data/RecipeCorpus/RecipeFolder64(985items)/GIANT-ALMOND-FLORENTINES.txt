Preparation Time: 0:41 1. Preheat oven to 375 F. Grease six 8-inch
foil pie pans. Foil pans must be used for easy removal of baked
florentines in 1 piece. 2. In a medium-large heavy saucepan, combine
butter, sugar, honey, and cream. Heat to boiling over medium heat,
stirring frequently. Cook 1 1/2 mins, stirring constantly. Remove
from heat. Stir in almonds. 3. Divide mixture evenly among greased
pie pans. Using back of wooden spoon, pat evenly into bottom of pans.
Bake pans 3 at a time, on a single oven rack, 10 to 14 mins, or until
a rich golden brown. Rotate pans during baking, if necessary, to
avoid overbrowning. Let cool completely in pans. Refrigerate 10 to 15
mins for ease in unmolding. 4. With fingers, carefully press in pan
bottoms from underneath and pop florentines out in 1 piece.
Refrigerate florentines, stacked between layers of wax paper until
thoroughly chilled, about 3 hours. 5. Spread melted chocolate coating
over bottoms of chilled florentines. Let stand until chocolate is
set. Wrap each florentine separately in plastic wrap. Store in
refrigerator.

NOTE: Use melted chocolate-coating wafers, which are available at cake
decorating and candy supply stores, to spread on the bottoms of
florentines for best results. This type of chocolate will stay shiny
and give your florentines a professional look. These make fantastic
holiday gifts.
