MMMMM----------------------------SOUP---------------------------------
5 c  Vegetable Stock
5 c  Chicken stock
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2    Bunches watercress, chopped
3    Green onion, finely chopped
Meatballs: Finely chop 12 of the water chestnuts. Reserve the
remaining ones for garnish. Combine the pork, ginger, chopped water
chestnuts, soy sauce, cornstarch, salt and pepper. Mix well and form
into balls 3/4 inch in diameter. These may be made in advance and
frozen. Be sure to thaw completely in refrigerator before poaching.

Soup: Bring the vegetable stock and chicken stock to a simmer in a
large pot. Put a fourth of the meatballs in the broth and poach until
they rise to the top.
Remove and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining meatballs. About 20
minutes prior to serving, return stock to a boil and add the
meatballs. Cook 10-15 minutes (Note: Meatballs will be slightly pink
in the center even after the second cooking.) Season with salt and
black pepper to taste. Turn heat to medium low. Add the watercress
and green onions. Cook, uncovered, for a few minutes until watercress
is slightly wilted and bright green in color. Add the remaining water
chestnuts and cook for 1 minute so that they remain crisp.

Serve immediately.
Serve as the first course of a traditional Chinese dinner or alone
as a light nutritious supper.
