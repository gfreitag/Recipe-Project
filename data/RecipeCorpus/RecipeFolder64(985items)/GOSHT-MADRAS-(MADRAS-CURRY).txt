Title: GOSHT MADRAS (MADRAS CURRY)
Categories: Lamb, Indian
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Lamb; cubed in 1" cubes
-(if you're going to be
-*really* authentic,
-use kid goat instead)
Lemon juice
2 ts Salt
1 lg Onion; chopped fine
2    Garlic clove; chopped fine
2    Chiles, dried; chopped fine
2 tb Coriander; ground
1 ts Cumin, ground
1 tb Turmeric
1 ts Ginger, powdered
2 ts Pepper, black
4 oz Tomato paste
1 1/4 c  Beef stock
1/4 c  Ghi
2 tb Garam masala
Sprinkle the lemon juice and salt over the meat. Mix the onion,
garlic and chili together well. Heat the ghi in a heavy saucepan over
medium heat and fry the onion mixture for 2 minutes. Add the
coriander, cumin, turmeric, ginger and pepper, stir well and cook
another 2-3 minutes. Add the lamb and lemon juice; stir well to coat
the meat with the spices. Cook 5-10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste
and beef stock, bring to a boil then cover and simmer gently 30-40
minutes until the meat begins to get tender. Sprinkle in the garam
masala and cook for a further 10 minutes. The gravy should by this
stage be very thick; if it is not, remove the lid from the pan and
increase the heat to boil off excess moisture until the gravy
thickens.
