Title: GINGERBREAD RICE-BRAN MUFFINS
Categories: Digest, Sept., Ovo
Yield: 12 Servings
1 1/2 c  Rice bran
1/4 c  Raisins
3/4 c  All-purpose flour or
Whole-wheat flour
1/2 c  Hot water
1 1/2 tb Baking powder
3/4 c  Molasses
3/4 ts Ginger
2 tb Corn syrup
3/4 ts Cinnamon
2    Egg whites
This recipe is from the 8-Week Cholesterol Cure Cookbook by Robert E.
Kowalski, pg290.  The only change I made was 2 Tbsp corn syrup
instead of 2 Tbsp canola oil. Oh, AND this is the only ff muffin
recipe I have made where the muffins don't stick to the paper cups
when you eat them right out of the oven!

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Mix dry ingredients, including raisins,
together in a large bowl.  Mix moist ingredients in a blender and
then add to dry ingredients. Pour batter into muffin pans lined with
paper baking cups.  Bake about 13 minutes.
