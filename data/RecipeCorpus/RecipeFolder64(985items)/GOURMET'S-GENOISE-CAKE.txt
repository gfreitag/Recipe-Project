Title: GOURMET'S GENOISE CAKE
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
4 lg Eggs
2/3 c  Sugar
2/3 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla
1/4 c  Clarified butter, melted and
-ooled to lukewarm
In a metal bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar. Set bowl on a pan
of simmering water, and whisk mixture until it is warm and the sugar
is dissolved. Remove bowl from pan and, with an electric mixer, beat
at moderate speed for 10-15 minutes or until it is triple in volume
and cooled to room temperature.

Meanwhile, sift flour with salt onto a sheet of wax paper. In a bowl,
combine the vanilla and butter. Sift and fold flour mixture into the
egg mixture in batches until the mixture is just combined. Stir a
fourth of the mixture into the butter, and fold the butter mixture
back into the batter.

Line bottom of a buttered 8-1/2-inch springform pan with wax paper,
butter the paper and dust with flour, shaking out the excess. Pour
batter into the pan, smoothing the top.

Bake in the middle of a preheated 350f oven for 30-35 minutes or
until a tester comes out clean.  Let the cake cool in the pan on a
rack for 5 minutes, then remove side of pan, and invert onto the
rack. Remove paper carefully and let cake cool completely.
