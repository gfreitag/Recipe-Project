Title: GIANT BUBBLE LIQUID
Categories: Info/tips
Yield: 1 Servings
-Jo Ferry cmsj69b
1/2 c  Joy or Dawn dish detergent
5 c  Water; distilled is best
2 tb Glycerine
Mix the dish detergent with the water. (Measure carefully, it makes
a big difference. Stir. Add the glycerine (you can usually get this
in a drug store), this makes more durable bubbles.
You can bend a wire coat hanger into a circle and wind a string
around it. Depending on how big you make your circle, you get great
big bubbles. The string helps in getting the liquid to stay on the
circle.
You can also use straws and string-Tie a 2 1/2 foot length of string
through 2 straws and unleash square <G> bubbles. The trick is to dip
your string and straw thing into the solution, then wave it through
the air. Break the bubble off by flipping the apparatus up a bit.
Plain straws make good bubble pipes. Also try using the plastic
strawberry baskets, they make lots of little bubbles. It is fun to
experiment with all different bubble makers.
Big-time bubble making is a bit like fishing. You'll have much
better luck in cool wet weather. Early evenings, nighttime and early
mornings are often good. Just after a rain is ideal. Don't throw any
leftovers away either. The longer your solution sits, the better it
gets.
