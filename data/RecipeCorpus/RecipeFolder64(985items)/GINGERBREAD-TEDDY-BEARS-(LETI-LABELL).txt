Categories: Cookies, Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
Here's one of my old
Favorites
Decorate, but it's fun and
They taste WONDERFUL.
Better than
Gingerbread men!
They are a lot of work to
1 c butter or margarine 2/3 c packed brown sugar 2/3 c dark corn
syrup, light corn syrup, or molasses 4 c flour 1 1/2 tsp ground
cinnamon 1 tsp ground ginger 1/4 tsp baking soda 1/2 tsp ground
cloves 1 beaten egg 1 1/2 tsp vanilla Miniature semisweet chocolate
pieces Decorator Icing (see recipe) (optional)

In a saucepan, combine butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup. Cook and
stir over medium heat until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved.
Pour into a large mixing bowl. Cool 5 minutes.

Mix flour, cinnamon, ginger, soda and cloves. Add egg and vanilla to
butter mixture; mix well. Add flour mixture; beat till well mixed.
Divide dough in half. Cover; chill 2 hours or OVERNIGHT.

For each bear, shape dough into one 1-inch ball, one 3/4 inch ball,
six 1/2 inch balls, and five 1/4 inch balls.

On an ungreased cookie sheet, flatten the 1-inch ball to 1/2 inch for
the body. Attach the 3/4 inch ball for the head, and flatten to 1/2
inch. Attach the 1/2 inch balls for arms, legs, and ears. Place 1 of
the 1/4 inch balls on the head for the nose. Arrange the remaining
1/4 inch balls atop the ends of the arms and legs for paws. Use
miniature chocolate pieces for the eyes and navel.

Bake in a 350 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until done. Remove
and cool on a wire rack.

If desired, pipe on bow ties with Decorator Icing.
