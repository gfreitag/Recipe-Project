Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
2 ts Dry yeast
1/4 c  Rye flour
1 tb Milk
2 tb Olive oil
1/2 ts Salt
1 3/4 c  Unbleached flour
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 oz Sonoma goat cheese *
2 oz French goat cheese *
7 oz Mozzarella; shredded
2    Slices prosciutto **
2 tb Finely cut fresh chives
2 tb Minced fresh parsley
1    Thyme sprig; chopped
1    Marjoram sprig; chopped
2    Sm. cloves garlic; minced
Black pepper
*Note: Sonoma goat cheese (or other goat cheese) and French goat
cheese (such as Boucheron) should be crumbled. **Prosciutto should be
julienned. To make dough, mix 1/4 cup lukewarm water, yeast and rye
flour in bowl. Let rise 20 to 30 minutes. Add 1/2 cup lukewarm water,
milk, olive oil, salt and all-purpose flour. Mix dough with wooden
spoon, then turn out onto floured board and knead until soft and
slightly sticky. Use quick, light motions with hands to prevent dough
from sticking. Add more flour to board as needed but no more than is
absolutely necessary. Knead 10 to 15 minutes until dough is soft and
elastic. Place dough in bowl that has been brushed with olive oil.
Oil surface of dough to prevent crust from forming. Cover bowl with
clean towel and place in warm place, about 90 to 110 degrees, to
rise. Let dough rise 40 minutes. Meanwhile, to make filling, combine
goat cheeses, mozzarella, prosciutto, chives, parsley, thyme,
marjoram and garlic in large bowl. Add pepper to taste and mix well.
Roll out pizza dough to circle about 14 inches in diameter or divide
dough into 2 or 3 pieces to make small calzone. For 1 large calzone,
place entire filling on half of dough circle, leaving 1-inch margin
around edges. Moisten edges with water and fold over other dough half
to make edges meet. Fold up edges to form running curl, pinching to
seal tightly. Place on floured paddle and slide onto oven floor. For
smaller calzone, use same method, adjusting amount of filling as
needed. Bake at 450 to 500F 15 to 25 minutes, or until bottom of
calzone is crisp. For small calzone, reduce cooking time by half.
Makes 1 large or 2 to 3 small calzone
