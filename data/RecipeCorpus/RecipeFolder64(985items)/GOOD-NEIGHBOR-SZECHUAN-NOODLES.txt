Requested by Louisvillean Carol Grady, who wrote: "I am addicted to
the wonderful food available at Louisville's Good Neighbor Foods
Co-op Cafe, but I know I can't ask you to obtain recipes for all of
their creations. Let's start with three of my favorites: hummus,
Szechuan noodles and maple pumpkin pie."  Alice Colombo responded: "I
have to agree with you - all are winners." Posted by Cathy Harned.
