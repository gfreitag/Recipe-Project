Title: GOLDEN ZUCCHINI~ ETC. BALTI
Categories: Balti, Vegetarian, Indian
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Yellow zucchini/courgette
1    Onion
1    Yellow or Orange Pepper
2    Small Red or Yellow Tomatoes
1    Clove Garlic
1/4 ts Turmeric
1/4 ts Chopped chilies (dried)
1    Small Cayenne chili
1 c  Balti Sauce
1/2 c  White wine, or
1/2 c  Vegetable stock
Vegetable oil for frying
Scrub all vegetables and dry. Heat oil in karahi. Saute onions until
transparent:  add turmeric, garlic and chopped dried chilies, and
saute for another minute (be careful not to let the garlic scorch),
then remove onions and garlic and set aside.  Reheat oil slightly.
Slice half the zucchini/courgette into rounds: chop the rest into
"matchsticks". Slice and roughly chop the tomatoes:  seed and chop
the peppers and chili. Quickly stirfry all these vegetables for about
two minutes or until partially cooked:  add the onions and garlic
again, then the balti sauce. Cook for about 5-10 more minutes until
you like the consistency. If you like, add white wine or vegetable
stock and cook a little longer until sauce reduces thick again. Serve
in karahi with naan bread, or (if you're feeling pedestrian) on a
plate, with rice.
