Title: GNOCCHI
Categories: Pasta, Low-fat
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Potatoes, boiled until
-tender and then riced or
-grated
3 c  Flour
1    -2 t. guar gum dissolved in
-water
2 ts Salt
mix everything together until you have a smooth dough. cut into
thumb-sized pieces and drop into boiling water. After they float to
the surface, wait 1-2 minutes and then retrieve them with a slotted
spoon. I found that using whole wheat flour kind of killed the potato
taste of the gnocchi, so if I make these in the future I'll probably
use white flour. Of course, this is a personal decision.  I thought
about trying some of the more exotic flours to see if they create a
less grainy taste; any suggestions?
