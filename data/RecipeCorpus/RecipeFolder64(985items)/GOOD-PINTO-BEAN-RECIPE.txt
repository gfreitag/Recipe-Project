Title: GOOD PINTO BEAN RECIPE
Categories: Appetizers, Pulses and, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Dried Pinto Beans -- soaked
Overnight
6 c  Cold Water
1    Bay Leaf
3    Fresh Sage Leaves
1    Or 2 Dried New Mexican
-Chiles - seeded
1/2 c  Hot Water
1 tb Olive Oil -- or vegetable
Oil
1 c  Chopped Onion
Salt
1 3/4 ts Cumin
3    Garlic Cloves -- finely
Chopped
1/2 ts Chipotle Puree
2 ts Fresh Sage -- chopped
Drain and rinse beans; place in large saucepan with cold water, bay
leaf, and whole sage leaves. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook
until tender. Meanwhile, cover chiles with hot water, soak about 20
minutes, and puree in a blender. Heat oil in large skillet; add
onion, 1 tea salt, and 1 tea cumin. Saute until tender; add garlic
and saute 1-2 minutes more. Add beans and broth to the onion along
with 1/2 tea salt, the remaining cumin, and the chili puree. Cook
medium about 25 minutes, stirring as needed. The beans should be soft
but not mushy. Add chopped sage and salt to taste. Note: I made this
at a school using canned beans, eliminating the soaking and long
cooking. I also used your basic chile powder instead of the dried
chiles, also eliminating the soaking. The chipotles are crucial,
though - salsa works as well as the puree, though you need to use a
little more
