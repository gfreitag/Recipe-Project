This comes from the New Basics Cookbook and is one I have just got to
try.

Preheat the oven to 350F.

Sprinkle the pork chops all over with the ground ginger.

Melt the butter in a large skillet, and brown the pork chops over
medium- high heat, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the chops to a
flameproof baking dish.

Add the ginger ale, fresh ginger, and crystallized ginger to the
skillet, and cook over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour this over
the chops, transfer to the oven, and bake for 30 minutes.

Sprinkle the walnuts and raisins over the chops, and bake an
additional 15 minutes.

Transfer the chops to a serving platter and keep warm. Add the cream
to the baing pan and place it over high heat. Cook, scraping up the
brown bits, until the sauce is slightly reduced and thickened, aobut
2 minutes. Pour the sauce over the chops and serve immediately.
