Title: GLAZED ALMOND BRIE
Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs, Fruits/nuts
Yield: 16 Servings
1 3/4 oz Wheel imported Brie cheese
- well chilled
2 tb Confectioners' sugar
1/2 c  Sliced unblanched almonds
Red & green seedless grapes
- in clusters, for garnish
WITH A SMALL, flexible knife, cut away rind from top of chilled
cheese. Be careful not to remove or split the rind on the sides. It
will form a wall for the melted cheese. Sift 1 tablespoon of
confectioners' sugar evenly over the surface and arrange almonds on
top, pressing gently into place. The cheese can be prepared to this
point as many as 2 days in advance. Cover loosely with foil and
refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before heating, place rack 6
inches from heat source and preheat the broiler. Line large baking
sheet with aluminum foil, place cheese on it and sift 1 tablespoon of
confectioners' sugar over nuts. Broil cheese until top is evenly
browned--about 1 to 2 minutes. Rotate cheese, if necessary, for even
browning. Watch carefully so it does not burn. Use foil to lift
cheese and transfer it to serving platter. Tear foil and gently
remove it. Garnish with clusters of grapes. Volume I of Abby Mandel's
