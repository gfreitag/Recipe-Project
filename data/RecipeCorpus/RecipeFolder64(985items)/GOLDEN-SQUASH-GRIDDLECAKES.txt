Title: GOLDEN SQUASH GRIDDLECAKES
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 c  Cornmeal
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground ginger
2    Eggs, beaten
1/2 c  Buttermilk
1 c  Well-cooked, smoothly mashed
-butternut squash
Servings: 4 to 6

margarine maple syrup, applesauce or fruit butter

Combine the first 5 ingredients in a mixing bowl. In another bowl,
combine the egg, buttermilk, and squash and stir together until
smooth. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in
the wet mixture. Stir together until completely combined, but do not
overbeat.

Heat a nonstick griddle. Melt just enough margarine to coat it
lightly. Pour the batter onto the griddle in scant 1/4 cupfuls enough
to make 3-inch cakes. Cook on both sides until golden. Keep the
griddlecakes warm in a covered casserole dish in a 200 deg. oven
until all are done. Serve at once with your favorite topping. Posted
