Here's the recipe you wanted from Ken Haedrich's Home For the Holidays
cookbook.
Butter the sides only of an 8-in. springform pan. Make the crust by
mixing the cracker crumbs and 1 T. sugar in a bowl. Add the butter
and rub it in until all of the crumbs are dampened by the fat.
Distribute the crumbs loosely but evenly in the pan and press them in
; pushing them slightly up the sides. Cover and chill while you make
the filling; preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using an electric
mixer, cream the cream cheese, honey, and sugar until light and
fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then add the remaining
ingredients and continue to beat until evenly blended; use the
greater amount of ginger if you want a pronounced ginger flavor, the
lesser amount for a subtle effect. Scrape the filling into the pan
and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cool the cake thoroughly on a
rack--it will take several hours--then cover, still in the pan, and
refrigerate for 12 hours before unmolding and slicing.

Note: Ken Haedrich writes, "I have played around some with baking
cheesecakes in a water bath, curious to see if it made any difference
in the final cake. It seems to improve the texture a little bit,
making it creamier. And I'm not sure if this is just a coincidence,
but my water bath cakes don't split on top after they come out of the
oven, perhaps Formatted by Elaine Radis
