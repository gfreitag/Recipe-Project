soften. Stir in the flour then gradually add the milk, stirring until
you have a smooth sauce. Remove from the heat and stir in the fish,
seasoning and add bayleaf.

Spoon into a 1.1 litre (2 pint) ovenproof pie dish and set aside
whilst preparing the topping.

Set oven to 200C/400F/Gas Mark 6.

Bring a pan of lightly salted water to the boil, cut the potato into
small chunks and slice the carrots. Cook until tender then drain and
mash until smooth.

Stir in half of the cheese. Whip the egg white until stiff and fold
into the potato mixture.

Spoon or pipe over the fish mixture and sprinkle with remaining grated
cheese.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until topping is golden and bubbling.
