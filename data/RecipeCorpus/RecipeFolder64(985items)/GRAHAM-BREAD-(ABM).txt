Title: GRAHAM BREAD (ABM)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/2 c  White flour
1 pk Yeast
2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Ginger
1 c  Milk
3/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Molasses
3 tb Butter
1 ts Salt
3 c  Graham flour
In large bowl stir together white flour, yeast, cinnamon and ginger.
In saucepan combine milk, water, molasses, butter and salt. Heat to
115 to 120 degrees, and butter is almost melted.  Add to flour
mixture, beat on low speed of electric mixer 1/2 minute, scraping
sides of bowl constantly. eat three minutes on high, stir in graham
flour. Stir in as much remaining flour as you can stir in with a
spoon. Turn out onto floured surface. Knead in enough white flour to
make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic, (8 to 10
minutes). You can use a bread machine for this, or personally I now
use a Kitchenaid mixer with dough hook (since my two bread machines
died). Shape into a ball, place in greased bowl, turn over once to
coat.  Cover, let rise until double, about 1 hour. Punch down, divide
dough in half.  cover let rest 10 minutes. Shape into two loaves,
whatever shape you want, and place in bread pans, pie pans for round
loaves, or free form on a cookie sheet. Cover, let rise until double,
about 30 minutes. Bake 375 25 - 30 minutes. Cool before slicing. This
is one of the best breads I have ever tasted.
