Yield: 2 Servings
225 g  Carrots; trimmed

150 ml Vegetable stock

A classic way of cooking carrots, particulary good in summer using
fresh baby carrots and parsley from the garden.

Cook the carrots in boiling salted water for 5 minutes, or until they
are just tender. Drain them in a colander, and refresh them under
running cold water. In a frying-pan toss the carrots in the butter
over moderate heat until they are well coated. Add the stock, sugar,
and salt and pepper to taste, and cook the mixture over a moderately
high heat, tossing the carrots, until the liquid is reduced to a
glaze. Stir in the parsley and the dill. Serve hot.
