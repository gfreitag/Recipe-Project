Title: GORDITAS
Categories: Mexican, Appetizers
Yield: 24 Gorditas
2    Dried ancho chilies or if
You can't find ancho chilies
Substitute 1/2 tsp. crushed
Red chilies
8 oz Can red kidney beans
1 c  Water
1 3/4 c  Masa harina
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Baking powder
Fat for frying
1 1/2 c  Guacamole
Radish slices
Open the chili peppers, cut off the stems and discard, remove the
seeds and discard also.  Finely chop the chilies. Cover with boiling
water to rehydrate. Allow the chilies to sit for about one hour, then
drain off the water.  Put the chilies into a blender and add the
undrained beans, water, and a half teaspoon of the salt. Replace lid
on blender and blend on high speed, until well mixed and smooth.  Mix
the masa harina, 3/4 salt and the baking powder.  Add bean mixture
and mix very well. Cover this mixture and allow it to stand for 15
minutes. Divide dough into 24 peices. Pat all peices separately, into
2 inch rounds. In a frying pan, heat about 1/8 inch of fat. Fry the
gorditas until they are crisp (about 2 mins. per side). Drain them on
paper towels, until no longer greasy. Put a teaspoonful of guacamole
on top of each gordita and garnish each with a radish slice.
