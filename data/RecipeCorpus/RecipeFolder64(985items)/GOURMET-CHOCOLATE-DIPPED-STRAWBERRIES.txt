Title: GOURMET CHOCOLATE DIPPED STRAWBERRIES
Categories: Ghirardelli, Desserts
Yield: 12 Servings
1 pt Large strawberries with
-stems
8 oz Ghirardelli Sweet Chocolate
DIRECTIONS: Carefully rinse strawberries. Using paper towels, dry
berries thoroughly. Break chocolate into sections. Finely chop 5 of
the sections and reserve. Break remaining sections into double boiler
over 1" simmering water. Stir constantly until melted and smooth. (Do
not overheat.) Remove pan of chocolate. Add reserved finely chopped
chocolate, stirring until smooth. Melted chocolate should be thick
enough to hold a shape when stirred. Hold each strawberry by stem or
a fork. Tilt the pan and use a spoon to coat each berry with
chocolate. Hold each berry upside down to catch drips. Place in
fluted foil cupcake liners or on pan covered with plastic wrap. Chill
until firm or freeze a few minutes to serve immediately.
