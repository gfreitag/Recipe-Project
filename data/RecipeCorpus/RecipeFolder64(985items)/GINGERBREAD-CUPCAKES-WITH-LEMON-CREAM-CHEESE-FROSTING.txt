Categories: Cakes, Cheese, Shara
Yield: 12 Servings
1 1/4 c  Flour
1 1/2 ts Ground ginger
1 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1/2 ts Allspice
1/4 ts Salt
1/2    Stick unsalted butter PLUS
2 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 c  Granulated sugar
1/2 c  Molasses
1 lg Egg, beaten lightly
1 ts Baking soda
8 oz Cream cheese, softened
1 1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
1/2 ts Vanilla
1 ts Grated lemon zest
2 ts Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Sliced crystalized ginger
Into a bowl sift together the flour, the ground ginger, the cimmamon,
the cloves, the allspice, and the salt.  In another bowl cream 1/2
stick of the butter, add the granulated sugar, and beat the mixture
until it is fluffy. Beat in the molasses and the egg, beating until
the mixture is smooth. In a measuring cup combine the baking soda
with 1/2 cup boiling water and stir the mixture to dissolve the
baking soda. Stir the mixture into the molasses mixture (the mixture
will appear curdled) and stir the molasses mixture into the flour
mixture, stirring to combine the ingredients well. Line twelve
1/2-cup muffin tins with paper liners and spoon the batter into the
liners, filling them halfway.  Bake the cupcakes in the middle of a
preheated 350~ F oven for 20 minutes, or until a tester comes out
clean. (The cupcakes will be flat or slightly indented on top.)
Transfer the cupcakes to a rack and let them cool.

In a bowl cream together the cream cheese and the remaining 2
tablespoons butter, add the confectioners' sugar and the vanilla, and
beat the mixture until it is fluffy and smooth.  Beat in the zest and
the lemon juice and chill the frosting for 30 minutes. Frost the
cupcakes and top each with some ginger.  Makes 12.
