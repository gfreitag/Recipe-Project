Gene Hill, who lives in Davis, California, bakes this bread at least
twice a week.  He recommends trying it as a toasted cheese sandwich.
Grill it with thin slices of red onion or bell pepper and cheese.

1.  Place the buttermilk, melted butter, rice vinegar, and salt in
bread pan.  Stir with a rubber spatula.

2.  In a large bowl, combine all the dry ingredients except the
yeast. Mix well with a whisk.

3.  In a separate bowl, combine the eggs and water; beat lightly.

4.  Place 1/2 of the dry ingredients in the bread pan. Add the egg
mixture. Add the remainder of the dry ingredients; sprinkle the yeast
on top. Select Light Crust setting and press Start.

5.  Observe the dough frequently during the kneading cycles. If it
does not appear to be mixing well, use a rubber spatula to assist it
occasionally.

6.  After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on wire
rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.

VARIATIONS * You can substitute olive oil for the butter. * Replace
1/4 to 1/2 cup of the rice flour with another gluten-free flour, such
as yellow or blue corn flour, polenta meal, or soy flour. * You can
add at least 1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese for a new flavor. * Saute
some onions in the melted butter, allow them to cool, then add them
and your favorite herbs to create an onion/herb bread.
