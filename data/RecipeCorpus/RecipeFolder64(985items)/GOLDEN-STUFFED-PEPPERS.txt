Categories: Main dish
Yield: 2 Servings

Pepper
Yellow peppers have a gentler, sweeter flavour than red or green, and
this mellowness is taken up by the grated courgettes and sweetcorn in
the stuffing. The stuffed peppers are covered with grated cheese and
baked - a delicious meal that you can serve with rice or potatoes and
a tossed salad.

Blanch the peppers in boiling water for 5 minutes, then drain, cut in
half and deseed them. Mix the grated courgette and chopped onion into
the sweetcorn pure and add half the cheese. Mix well and then stir
in the beaten egg. Mix thoroughly and season to taste. Pile into the
halved peppers. Sprinkle with the rest of the cheese and bake at 180
degrees C / 350 degrees F / gas 4 for 25 minutes. Serve hot.
