Categories: Pies, Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
3/4 c  Finely chopped ginger snaps
1/2 c  Finely crushed grah. cracker
1 tb Sugar
3 tb Butter, melted
1    Env. unflavored gelatin
8 oz Can pineapple slices
2    Small bananas
2 c  Sliced strawberries
2    Kiwi fruit, peeled and slice
Stir together gingersnaps, graham crackers and sugar.
Drizzle with margarine, tossing to combine.  Press onto bottom and up
sides of a 9" pie plate to form a firm, even crust. Bake in a
375-degree oven for 5 minutes. Cool. For glaze, drain pineapple,
reserving juice(unsweetened juice).  Cut pineapple into small pieces
and set aside. Add enough unsweetened pineapple juice (about 1 1/2
cups) to the reserved juice to make 1 3/4 cups total liquid. In a
small sauce pan stir together pineapple liquid and gelatin, then let
stand 5 minutes. Stir over low heat until gelatin dissolves. Cover
and chill to the consistency of unbeaten egg whites (partially set).
Spread 1/3 cup of the glaze over botton of crust. Slice bananans and
arrange over glaze. Top with another 1/3 cup of glaze and arrange
strawberries over glaze.  Stir together pineapple pieces and
remaining glaze, then spoon over strawberries. Chill for 2 to 4 hours
or until set.
Before serving, arrange kiwi fruit on pie.
