Make this dessert in early summer when gooseberries come into season
~ one of the most lovely of our soft fruits. Gooseberries make
gorgeous pies and crumbles too - but this recipe, for all its
simplicity, brings out the best in them.

Dissolve the sugar in the water with the vanilla stick, stirring, and
boil for 5 minutes until it is syrupy. Add the gooseberries to the
syrup and poach very gently for 10 minutes. Cool. Serve chilled, in
two glass dishes, with crme fraiche or Greek yogurt.
