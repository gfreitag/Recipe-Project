MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
Cutting against the grain, slice flank steak into strips about 2
inches long by 1/4 inch wide. (slightly frozen meat makes this task
easier ++ FHT). Combine batter ingredients and mix with steak slices;
toss to coat and set aside. Cut up green and red peppers into same
size strips and mix with garlic and ginger. Combine sauce ingredients
and set aside. To cook Ginger Fried Beef, put 10 cups cooking oil
into a deep fryer or pot and preheat to 250 degrees F.  Fry coated
meat mixture, a few pieces at a time, until crispy, about seven to
ten minutes. Set meat aside on a paper towel to drain and keep oil at
same temperature for second stage frying. Put 3 Tbsp cooking oil in
wok and heat. Add green and red pepper mixture and stir-fry over high
heat 15 to 20 seconds. Add sauce mixture and cook another 15 to 20
seconds until somewhat thickened. Cooking times may be a little
longer on a conventional stove. Deep fry beef a second time for one
minute.  Remove from oil and add to stir fry; toss lightly to coat
thoroughly and serve. Enjoy. The Ginger Beef Peking House Restaurant
serves the best Ginger Fried Beef in Calgary. Contributed by Fred
