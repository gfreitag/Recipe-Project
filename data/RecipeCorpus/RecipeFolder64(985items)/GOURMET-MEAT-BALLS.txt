Title: GOURMET MEAT BALLS
Categories: Meats
Yield: 2 Servings
2 tb Onion, minced
1 c  Bread crumbs, soft
1 tb Butter
3/4 c  Milk
1 ts Salt
1 lb Ground chuck
1/2 c  Chili sauce
1 c  Sour cream
Cook onion in butter until its transparent.  Pour milk over bread
crumbs and let stand until milk is absorbed, beat with fork to a
smooth mass. Add beef, onion, salt and mix only until blended. Form
into small balls and brown in 10 inch skillet; no fat needed. Combine
sour cream, chili sauce and pour over meat balls. Simmer gently for
10 minutes, turning meat balls once or twice as they cook. You can
serve them on steamed rice, buttered noodles or as I do, on mashed
potatoes. Randy Rigg
