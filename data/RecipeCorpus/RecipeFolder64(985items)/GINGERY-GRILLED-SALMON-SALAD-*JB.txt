1/4 c  Nonfat plain yogurt
2 tb Finely chopped fresh ginger
2    Cloves garlic, finely
-chopped
2 tb Fresh lime juice
1 tb Freshly grated lime zest
1 tb Honey

1. In a small bowl, whisk together yogurt, ginger, garlic, lime
juice, lime zest, honey, oil, salt and pepper. Place salmon in a
shallow glass dish and pour marinade over it, turning the salmon to
coat on all sides. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 20 to
30 minutes, turning once or twice.

2. Meanwhile, prepare a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill. (Do not
use a grill pan; salmon will stick.)

3. Using a long-handled barbecue brush, coat the grill rack with oil.
Place salmon, skin-side up, on the grill. Cook for 5 minutes. Using 2
metal spatulas, carefully turn the salmon pieces over and cook just
until opaque in the center, 4 to 6 minutes longer. With 2 spatulas,
remove salmon from the grill. Slip off the skin.

4. Toss watercress salad with dressing and divide among 4 plates. Top
with a piece of grilled salmon. Garnish with lime wedges. Serve
immediately.
