Title: GF PAT'S BROWN & WHITE RICE FLOUR BREADS AN
Categories: Breads
Yield: 14 Servings
2 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Wrist-warm water
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 1/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
1 c  Brown rice flour
2 c  White rice flour
1/4 c  Sugar
4 ts Xanthan gum
OR 1 tbsp dry pectin
2/3 c  Non-instant dry milk
OR 1/3 cup soy powder
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 lg Eggs
Dissolve 2 tsp sugar and 1/2 cup water in 2 cup bowl. Sprinkle on
yeast. Set aside for 10 minutes or until froth nearly reaches top.
Combine water and shortening in saucepan. Heat until shortening
melts. Cool to lukewarm. Combine dry ingredients in mixer bowl.  Add
yeast mix to flours. Blend well.  Add shortening mix. Blend well. Add
eggs. Mix at highest speed with mixer for 2 minutes (my note ~ assume
this requires a strong mixer with a dough hook?)  Let dough rise in a
warm place until doubled, about an hour. Pour dough into greased,
small bread pans 3/4 full or into cans for round breads.  Let rise
again. Bake at 400 for 10 minutes. Place foil over breads and bake
for 50 minutes. Remove from pans immediately, cool on rack. Recipe
may be doubled.  Dough may be shaped for hot dog or hamburger buns
after first rising.  For herb bread, add 2 Tbsp fennel seeds or dried
herbs of choice to dry flour.
