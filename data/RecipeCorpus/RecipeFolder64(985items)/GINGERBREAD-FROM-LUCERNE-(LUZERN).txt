Gingerbread from Lucerne, the story:

There has always been a place for gingerbread on market stalls and at
fairs. It was customary for a young man to offer his sweetheart a
gingerbread cake, which she would acceptwith delight. Since the Middle
Ages, Lucerne has seen the creation of a large number of such
delicacies influenced by its governors and merchants.

The recipe:

Add the lemon juice to the cream and leave for a few minutes. Mix
together the cream, pear puree sugar, mixed spices and bicarbonate of
soda. Add the flour. Mix until well blended and then add the nuts.

Fill a flan ring (24 cm diameter, 6 cm high) and bake in the oven for
50 minutes at 190 oC.

Serve cold.
