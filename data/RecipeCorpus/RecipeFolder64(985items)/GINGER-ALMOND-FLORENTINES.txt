Recipe by: Williams-Sonoma Kitchen Library - Cookies & Preparation
Time: on T
Preheat oven to 350~. Line 2 large, heavy baking sheets with
aluminum foil. Lightly butter foil.
Combine cream, granulated sugar, brown sugar and butter in a heavy
saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, just until
sugars dissolve and butter melts. Add almonds, flour, ginger, and
orange and lemon zests. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly.
Remove from heat.
Drop 1 tablespoon batter (batter will be runny) onto a prepared
baking sheet. Repeat five times, spacing cookies 3 inches apart.
Repeat with second baking sheet.
Bake until deep brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Using a
round cookie cutter or a glass 3 inches in diameter, push hot cookie
edges in toward center to neaten them, shaping into 3-inch rounds.
Slide foil off sheets. Line the same sheets with new foil, butter
foil and repeat with remaining batter.
Cool cookies completely on the foil. Carefully peel cookies off
foil and arrange them smooth-side up on the baking sheets. Spoon 1
teaspoon of the hot chocolate coating in center of each and, using a
small icing spatula or knife, spread to edges. Refrigerate until
chocolate is set, about 30 minutes. Store layered between waxed paper
in airtight container in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
Makes about 2 dozen.

CHOCOLATE COATING:  Combine chocolate and shortening in top of
double boiler. Melt over (not touching) water just until smooth,
stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Alternatively, melt
chocolate and shortening in heatproof bowl placed over (not touching)
simmering water. Dip one flat side of biscotti into warm chocolate or
spread like icing. Refrigerate until chocolate sets.
Makes about 3/4 cup.
