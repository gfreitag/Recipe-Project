Title: GOOEY CHEESE BREAD ABM
Categories: Breads, Kooknet, Cyberealm
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 c  Water
2    Eggs
1/4    Unsalted Butter
1 ts Honey
1 ts Salt
2 1/2 c  Flour
2 ts Yeast
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
3 c  Swiss Cheese; shredded
Place all dough ingredients in pan and program for knead only. Press
start. The dough will be slightly sticky. After the kneading cycle,
transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic
wrap, and let it rise in the refrigerator overnight, or as long as 24
hours. Grease and flour a 9" cake pan. Preheat the oven to 375øF.
with the rack in the center position.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly
floured work surface. Roll the dough to a 14 x 10 rectangle with the
long side nearest you. Sprinkle 2 cups of the cheese over the surface
of the dough. Starting with the edge closest to you, roll the dough
up like a jelly roll. Press the edges together and turn it over so
the seam is now facing down. With the seam still down, roll the
cylinder around itself in a coil and transfer it to the prepared pan.
Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top of the loaf and allow to
rise, uncovered for 20 minutes. Bake for 35 minutes at 375øF., then
turn the oven down to 350øF. and bake for 10 more minutes. If the
cheese begins to brown quickly during the first 35 minutes, turn the
oven down sooner.
