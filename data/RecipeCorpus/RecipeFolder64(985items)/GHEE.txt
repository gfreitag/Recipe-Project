Title: GHEE
Categories: Indian, Balti, Fat
Yield: 12 Servings
2 lb Butter
Put the butter into a good-sized nonstick pan.  Melt at the lowest
possible heat.

When it's all melted, increase heat slightly.  There must be no sign
of smoke or any other undue activity indicating too much heat. Leave
the butter to stew (the only word for it, really) for about an hour.
Watch it carefully to make sure it doesn't get too hot and start to
scorch. The milk solids will fall to the bottom of the pan: others
will float on top.
DON'T STIR or agitate the pan under any circumstances!

At the one-hour point, carefully skim off any remaining floating
stuff with a skimmer or slotted spoon. Remove the ghee from the heat
and allow it to cool for 10-15 minutes.  Strain it into a heatproof
jar through a triple thickness of cheesecloth, or a thickness of
butter muslin if you can get it, or even through paper towels.

The ghee will solidify, but it won't get too hard.  It should be light
yellow and have a lovely butterscotchy aroma. Keep it tightly covered
in a cool place.  It will keep almost indefinitely if you've
successfully gotten all the milk solids out.

Cholesterol alert, for those needing one:  This is 100% pure
butterfat. Use in moderation.
