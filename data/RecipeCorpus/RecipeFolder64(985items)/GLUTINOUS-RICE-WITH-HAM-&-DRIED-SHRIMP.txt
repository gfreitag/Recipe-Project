Glutinous rice is a sticky rice high in the B vitamins. Many Chinese
cat it in the winter time because its high protein content keeps them
warm.

Place rice in a heat proof earthen pot.  Add water and bring to boil.
Lower heat to medium and cook, uncovered, until all water is
absorbed. Combine remaining ingredients and place on top of rice.
Cover and cook at lowest heat for 20 minutes.  Let stand for
10    minutes before serving.
