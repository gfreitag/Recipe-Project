Title: GRAND OPERA CREAMS
Categories: Candies
Yield: 24 Candies
2 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Light cream
2 tb Butter
2 tb Light corn syrup
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
2 oz Semisweet chocolate
2 ts Solid vegetable shortening
Combine sugar, salt, cream, butter, and corn syrup in a heavy 2
1/2-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook at a
gentle boil, stirring frequently, until the mixture reaches 238
degrees F on the candy thermometer (soft ball stage).

Remove from heat and cool, without stirring, until mixture is 110
degrees F. Add vanilla and beat vigorously until candy is thick and
loses its gloss. Quickly drop by teaspoonfuls into mounds on waxed
paper. If the candy gets too stiff and dry before this is completed,
knead each dropped candy between fingers or roll between the palms of
the hands. It will soften and become more attractive. Let candy stand
until firm to the touch.

Meanwhile, melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering
water. Stir in vegetable shortening. Spoon a small amount of chocolate
glaze over each cream. Let stand until set. Wrap in plastic and store
in refrigerator. Makes about 24 candies.
