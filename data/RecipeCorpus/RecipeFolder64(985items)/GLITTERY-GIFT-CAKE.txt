combine vanilla chips & corn syrup. Melt over low heat until mixture
is smooth, stirring constantly. Refrigerate 15-20 minutes or until
mixture is firm enough to knead. Knead until smooth. Divide mixture
into 2 parts, making 1/4 & 3/4 portions. Knead a few drops of green
food coloring into 1/4 of mixture. Wrap in plastic wrap. Knead a few
drops red food coloring into 3/4 of mixture. Place red mixture
between 2 sheets of parchment paper or on surface sprinkled lightly
with powdered sugar; roll out mixture into 16*6" rectangle. With
knife or pastry wheel, cut lengthwise into 3/4" strips. Place strips
on cake to resemble ribbon on a package; fold additional strips to
form bow. Roll out green mixture as directed about to 1/8 inch
thickness. Using holly leaf cutter, cut out 8 leaves. Score veins
with tip of knife. Tuck leaves around bow for garnish. Sprinkle
ribbon & leaves with edible glitter.

TIPS: Edible glitter is available at kitchen specialty shops.

To keep parchment paper from slipping while rolling out ribbons, tape
to counter. Submitted By THESERVS@GATE.NET (THOMAS E. HAUG) On THU,
