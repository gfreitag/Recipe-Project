Title: GORGONZOLA WAFERS
Categories: Crackers, Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
1/2 lb Blue cheese
8 tb Unsalted butter, 750f.
1 c  All-purpose flour
3/4 c  Pine nuts
1/4 ts Salt
Grease a cookie sheet lightly. Cook's notes: Use room temperature
Gorgonzola or blue cheese that has been crumbled. Do not use a double
or triple creme blue cheese in this recipe. Preliminaries: Preheat
oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a baking sheet with butter.
Procedure: Combine the cheese and butter in a food processor fitted
with the metal blade or an electric mixer; blend until creamy. Add
the flour, pine nuts and salt, processing just to blend. Form into
two 1-1/2 inch diameter cylinders and wrap each in plastic wrap or
wax paper. Refrigerate until firm, several hours or overnight. Slice
the dough into rounds about 1/8 inch thick and place about 2 inches
apart on cold, lightly greased baking sheets. Bake in a preheated 375
degree oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Immediately remove
from the baking sheets and cool on wire racks. Presentation: Serve
cold. Store in airtight containers.
