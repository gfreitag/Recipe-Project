DIRECTIONS:

Fill a large, high sided skillet with salted water and bring to a
boil. Add the asparagus and cook until barely tender, about 10
minutes. Drain in a colander, refresh under cold water and drain
again. Pat dry and spread on a platter.

In a small saucepan, melt 3 Tbsp of the butter. Drizzle it over the
asparagus. Wrap 1 piece of prosciutto around the middle of 1 thick or
2 thin asparagus stalks.

Place the flour on a plate. Beat the eggs in a wide shallow bowl.
Roll one of the asparagus bundles in the flour, then dip in the egg
and return to the platter. Repeat with the remaining bundles.

In a large skillet, heat the remaining 3 Tbsp butter and the oil over
moderate heat. Working in batches, add the asparagus bundles and fry,
turning once, until golden, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels;
serve at once.
