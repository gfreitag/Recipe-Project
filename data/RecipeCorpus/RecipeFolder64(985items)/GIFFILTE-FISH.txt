Yield: 18 Servings
5 lb Fish; equal amounts
-pike, carp, etc
3    Onions; sliced

3    Large carrots; sliced
1    -Water; to cover
1    -Salt; to taste
1    White pepper; to taste
4    Eggs
2 tb Matzo meal
1    Salt to taste
1    White pepper to taste
1/4 c  Water
Carrots; sliced for pan
Onions; sliced for pan
1 bn Beets; sliced (optional)
Have fish man grind: 5 lbs.fish filets-equal amounts; white fish and
pike;and a small amount of carp or buffle carp; In a large kettle:
heads,bones,and trimmings of fish; 3 onions,sliced; 1 celery
stalk,sliced; 2 large carrots,sliced; water to cover; salt to taste;
white pepper to taste;  Bring to boil. While this is simmering
prepare the fish.
Combine in Food Processor: 1 onion; 4 eggs; add mixture to: ground
fish; 2 tbs.matzo meal ; salt to taste; white pepper to taste; 1/4
cup water; Shape fish mixture into balls. I used to do this by hand;
chopping in a large wooden bowl with a hack messer. Be CARFUL, you
don't want mush but distinct tiny peices.
Take another pan; and layer the beets on the bottom; some sliced
carrots, onions, fish; repeat with everything but the beets. end eith
some carrots. Pour the broth from the OTHER kettle over the fish.
Simmer,covered for 2 hours.  When cool,remove fish balls to platter
and garnish with sliced cooked carrots. Strain broth and chill.
Serve with jellied fish broth and fresh ground horseradish. NOTE: The
beets are unusal but my Mom and Bubbe ALWAYS used them. They do two
things; keep the fish from 'catching' on the bottom and give the
broth a ruby red color; but not the fish; they remain white.

I have never served it with anything but plain freshly grated
horseradish.
