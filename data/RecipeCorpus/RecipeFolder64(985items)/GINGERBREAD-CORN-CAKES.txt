MMMMM--------------------------PANCAKES-------------------------------
3/4 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 c  Unbleached flour
1/4 c  Yellow cornmeal; preferably
-stone ground
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Ground ginger
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/2 ts Salt
2 lg Eggs
1/4 c  Unsulfured molasses
1 2/3 c  Milk
1/4 c  Flavorless vegetable oil
MMMMM----------------------WARM APPLESAUCE---------------------------
1 1/2 c  Sweetened or unsweetened
-applesauce
3 tb Unsulfured molasses
1 tb Sugar; optional
In a lg. bowl, combine dry ingredients.  Toss to mix well. In a
separate bowl, beat eggs lightly.  Whisk in molasses and milk. Make a
well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the liquid.
Whisk several times, just until smooth; do not overmix. Stir in the
oil. The batter will be thin at this point, but it will thicken as it
stands. Let rest 5 mins. If it still seems a bit thin, thicken by
whisking in a few tbspfuls of flour.

Cook on a preheated greased griddle or skillet for 1.1/2 mins., flip,
and cook for about 1 min.  Serve with Warm Applesauce or maple syrup.

Warm Applesauce - puree applesauce, molasses, and sugar (optional) in
a food processor.  Add just enough water to bring it to the
consistency of a thickish sauce. Transfer the sauce to small
saucepan. Heat, thinning if necessary, with a little more water.
Serve over Gingerbread Corn Cakes.
