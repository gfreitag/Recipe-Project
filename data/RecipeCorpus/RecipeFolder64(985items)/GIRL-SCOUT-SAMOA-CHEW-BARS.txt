Title: GIRL SCOUT SAMOA CHEW BARS
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Samoas cookies
1/4 c  Melted margarine
1/4 c  Graham cracker crumbs
6 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
2 oz Butter
2 c  Corn syrup
2 c  Sugar
6    Eggs
2 c  Pecan halves
1/2 c  Small semisweet
-chocolate chips
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-by-11-inch pan about 2 inches
deep, then line it with baking parchment. Process the Samoas cookies
and the graham cracker crumbs in a food processor, then add the
melted margarine. Pat this  mixture into the bottom of the pan.

Melt the semi-sweet chocolate and the butter together in one pan. In
another pan, combine the corn syrup and the sugar; heat until smooth.
Then add  it to the chocolate mix.

Add eggs to the mixture. Combine pecan halves and the small chocolate
chips to the mixture. Pour into crust and bake for 45 minutes to an
hour until center remains a little loose. This recipe is essentially
a chocolate pecan pie, creator Paul Philpot says, and when done will
be firm on top but a bit damp with a few cracks in the surface. Cool
before cutting.
