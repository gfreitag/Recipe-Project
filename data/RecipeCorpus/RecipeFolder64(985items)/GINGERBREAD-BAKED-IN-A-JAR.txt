Title: GINGERBREAD BAKED IN A JAR
Categories: Gifts, Cakes
Yield: 1 Servings
2 1/4 c  All purpose flour
3/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
2 ts Ground ginger
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1 c  Margarine; softened
3/4 c  Water, hot
1/2 c  Molasses
Preheat oven to 350 degrees (pan method) or 325 for jars.

Grease (use shortening) a 9x9x2 inch baking pan or 5 (12 oz) Kerr
Quilted Crystal Jelly Jars (#14400-80400)--they MUST have straight
sides, no buldges in the jars. Also, the jars will have to be
sterilized first--boil them for 10 minutes, leave the lids and rings
in the water until you're ready to use them; remove the jars and
allow them to air-dry and cool before greasing. Use a pastry brush to
grease the jars. DO NOT use Pam or Baker's Secret!

In a large bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda,
salt, ginger, cinnamon and cloves. Stir in margarine, water and
molasses until well blended. Pour into prepared pan or divide equally
among the 5 jars. Place jars on a cookie sheet or they'll tip over.

PAN METHOD: Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 40-50 minutes or
until cake tester inserted in center comes out clean. Cool slightly
on wire rack.

JAR METHOD: Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for 35-40 minutes or
until cake tester inserted deep into the center of each jar comes out
clean. Have your lids ready (HOT). Take one jar at a time from the
oven (USE HEAVY DUTY MITTS--the jars ARE HOT!) and place a lid on,
then the ring. Tightly screw on lids. Allow to cool on your counter
top. You'll know when the jars have sealed, you'll hear a "plinking"
sound. If you don't hear the sound, wait until the jars have cooled,
then press down on the jar lids, they shouldn't move at all. Lynn
