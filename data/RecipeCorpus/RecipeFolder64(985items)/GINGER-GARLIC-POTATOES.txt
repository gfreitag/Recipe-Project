Title: GINGER-GARLIC POTATOES
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 1 Servings
1 x  Potatoes, cooked, peeled,
And cut in 3/4 inch dice
1    2" x 1" x 1" in piece of
Fresh ginger, peeled and
Coarsely chopped
3    Cloves garlic
3 tb Water
1/2 ts Turmeric
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cayenne
1 ts Fennel seeds (optional)
Blend the water and spices (except the fennel seeds) into a paste.
Heat some oil in a pan  (I use a wok.) When hot, put in the fennel
seeds, and then the paste. Fry the paste for a few minutes (donUt
lean over the pan and inhale too deeply.) Add the potatoes and fry
until encrusted with the paste.

Potatoes can also be cooked in the basic hash-brown method, or boiled
or steamed, or baked, or cooked with a bchamel sauce, or mashed, or
whatever.

This is unquestionably one of the best potato recipes ever. It comes
again from Madhur Jaffrey.  On this, I give exact measurements.
