Title: GLUEHWEIN
Categories: Beverages, German, Alcohol
Yield: 4 Servings
60 g  Sugar
1/2    Cinnamon stick
4    Cloves
Peel of 1/2 lemon
1/8 l  Water
1 l  Red wine
Juice of 1/2 - 1 lemon
Put cinnamon, cloves and lemon peel in a paper tea filter; tie it
shut with a piece of white yarn. Together with the water and the
sugar, bring it to a boil in a pot, let sit for 20 minutes. Take out
the tea filter, add the red wine and heat. The art is to heat the
wine up as close to its boiling temperature without ever getting it
to boil (the most important thing about making gluehwein is that the
wine must NEVER boil). Finally, add lemon juice to taste.

Possible variations: ~ leave away the lemon juice or use orange juice
instead ~ leave away the lemon peel ~ instead of boiling the tea
filter, put it directly into the wine, heat,
and let soak for 30 - 45 minutes (you don't need the water this
way); if
you chop up the ingredients before putting them in the filter, you
get a
more intensive flavor ~ add a few drops of vanilla ~ add a little
cardamom and/or ginger ~ vary the quantities of cinnamon, cloves and
sugar ~ to get the possibly most famous type of gluehwein, the
Nuernberger
Christkindlesmarkt-Gluehwein, use blueberry wine instead of red wine
