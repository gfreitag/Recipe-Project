Yield: 2 Servings
450 g  Aubergines, sliced
Olive oil for frying

A simple dish of aubergines, fried until golden, is topped with a
mouth-watering mixture of chopped shallots, garlic, parsley and
breadcrumbs. Delicious with a tomato and onion salad, some tossed
lettuce and warm granary bread.

Fry the sliced aubergines briskly in the olive oil for 2-3 minutes on
each side. Cook a few slices at a time. When all the aubergine slices
are cooked, return them to the pan.

Mix the shallots, garlic, parsley and breadcrumbs together. Sprinkle
this mixture over the aubergines, season and cook over a low heat for
a further 10 minutes.
