Put fruit in a bowl, drain and reserve juice.

Put champagne and the hot pepper in a small saucepan, bring to a boil
and remove from heat.  Discard hot pepper and let champagne sit for
10 minutes. Combine fruit and lettuce in a salad bowl or individual
salad bowls. Add Rice Dream to cooled champagne and mix well. Pour
over salad and serve immediately.

The original recipe called for heavy cream, and I have tested it with
Rice Dream.  It tastes great, but Rice Dream does have fat. I have
not tried low fat soy milk (can't find it, for one thing), but the
vanilla flavor would probably be perfect. It is also good, though not
as good, without a cream substitute at all. A sweeter wine such as
Riesling is better without Rice Dream.

NOTE:  boil the wine longer if you want all of the alcohol out. I
don't serve this to children or alcoholic friends. Most of it seems
to be gone, however.
