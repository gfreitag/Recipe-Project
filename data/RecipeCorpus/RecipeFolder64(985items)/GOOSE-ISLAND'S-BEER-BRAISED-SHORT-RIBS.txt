Categories: Beef
Yield: 4 Servings
8    Beef short ribs
1 c  All-purpose flour
;salt & pepper to taste
1/2 c  Oil; preferably canola
2 tb Unsalted butter
4 lg Onions; chopped
4    Cloves garlic; peel/sliced
48 oz Brown ale
3    Thyme sprigs
2    Bay leaves
2 tb Tomato paste
1 1/2 qt Beef broth; or chicken

1. Pat ribs dry with paper towels; remove any slivers of bone. Pour
flour onto a paper plate or shallow soup dish and season generously
with salt and pepper. Coat ribs in seasoned flour; set aside.

2. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add
ribs and brown on all sides, about 10 minutes total. (Do not crowd
pan; work in batches instead. Lower heat if necessary to prevent
burning.)

3. Transfer browned ribs to Dutch oven or large, heavy-bottomed pot.
Pour off fat from skillet. Add butter; onions and sliced garlic to
pan; cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Spoon over ribs.

4. Pour beer over ribs and onions; heat to a boil. Lower heat and
simmer, uncovered, until beer is reduced by one third, about 45
minutes. Add thyme, bay leaves, tomato paste and stock. Cover pot and
simmer until meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.

5. Remove ribs to a serving platter or bowl; keep warm. Remove and
discard thyme and bay leaf. Pass broth and onions through food mill
into a sauce pan. (Alternatively, puree the onions with a little
broth in food processor.) Skim fat from sauce. Reheat, boiling
briefly if necessary to thicken, and adjust seasoning to taste.
Portion sauce onto warmed plates. Top with ribs. Pass horseradish at
table.
