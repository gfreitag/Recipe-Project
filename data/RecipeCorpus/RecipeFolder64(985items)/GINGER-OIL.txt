Ginger oil can be made quickly by putting twelve slices of ginger and
a half cup of peanut oil in a small frying pan and cooking over
medium heat until the ginger is browned and the oil is almost
smoking. Remove the pan from the heat and take out the ginger; what
remains is a tasty oil that you can use to dress pasta or make into a
sauce for fish. For a spicier oil, add a few whole, dried hot peppers
with the ginger. For the simplest sauce made from ginger oil, just
whisk in two tablespoons of soy sauce (I like Kikkoman's best). This
quantity is enough to sauce about two pounds of fish fillets--salmon,
tuna,or whitefish. For a light main dish, poach the fish--and add a
few thin slices of ginger to the poaching liquid. (By Jackie Shen)
