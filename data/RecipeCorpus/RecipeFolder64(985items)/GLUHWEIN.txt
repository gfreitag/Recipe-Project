Long years ago, the Christmas Gluhwein was served to the guests in a
king-sire stein, Into a pitcher a hot poker was thrust, And good old
days were then discussed.

Here's how you make this fine liqueur that wins the heart of the
connoisseur. Wait for some cool brisk holiday weather, '

Then mix these ingredients all together.

Heat in a saucepan but do not boil, because if you do the mixture you
spoil. Then into a pitcher strain as you pour.

You're ready now for the epicure.

Thrust in the hot poker - there you are; Frohliche Weihnachten und
Prosit Neujahr!
