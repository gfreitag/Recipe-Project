Title: GIPSY HOUSE GRAPE JELLY
Categories: Preserves, Fruits
Yield: 1 Servings
4 1/2 lb Grapes
Sugar
Put the washed bunches of grapes into the pan and just cover with
water, holding the fruit down with your hand. Simmer then gently
until they are soft, about 20 minutes. Strain off the juice using a
nylon muslin bag. Measure the liquid: for every 1 pt liquid, allow 1
lb sugar. Return the juice to the pan, bring to the boil, add the
sugar and boil until setting point is reached. Ladle into jars, allow
to cool and wax seal. This jelly can be flavoured with a small piece
of cinnamon or a clove added to each pot.
