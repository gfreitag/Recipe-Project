MMMMM-------------------------MAIN DISH------------------------------
2    Rock Cornish game hens
-(1 lb. each)
1/4 c  Corn syrup
1 tb Prepared mustard
-(Dijon or spicy)
1 sm Garlic clove
-peeled and finely chopped
Salt to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
-to taste
Juice of 1/2 lemon
-(reserve other half)
To make the curry powder, grind the spices together until they
resemble a coarse powder, either with a mortar and pestle or in a
clean electric coffee grinder.

If the hens are frozen, thaw overnight in refrigerator. Rinse hens
with cold water; pat dry.

In small bowl, combine curry powder with syrup, mustard, garlic, salt,
pepper and lemon juice. Preheat oven to 375 F.

Cut reserved lemon half in half again; place inside hens. If desired,
truss (tie or skewer) hens, to secure legs. Line a shallow roasting
pan with foil, dull side facing up, for easy cleanup. Place hens in
pan and brush with some of the glaze. Reserve remainder of glaze for
frequent basting.

Bake in oven 1 hour or longer, until juices run clear (meat should
still be juicy.)  Baste often for crispy, golden skin. Halfway
through baking, cover legs and wing tips with foil to prevent
scorching.

Serve with rice and stir-fried vegetables.
