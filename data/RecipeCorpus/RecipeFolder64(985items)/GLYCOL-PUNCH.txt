Glycol Punchhas two primary ingredients: Diet Mountain Dew, which has
an decidedly evil odd yellow glow to it. Diet is necessary so that
you don't over sugar people. BTW, we also tried other sodas,
including Squirt, 7-up and Sprite, but none had that evil yellowness.

A flourescent blue liquid. I know for a fact that the raspberry
"little hugs" drinks for kids are the perfect color. There is a
recent Kool-Aid blue flavor that I'm sure would work well, too.

For the "little hugs" the ratio is about 4-5 barrels to 1 2-liter
bottle of soda.  Adjust as you think best. I'd start by pouring out
the soda and adding the blue. You know you've got it right when you
get the sickly yellow-green of many Glycol-based Antifreezes. Plus,
when you drink, it fizzes!
