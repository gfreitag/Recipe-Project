Categories: Desserts, Ice cream, Flowers
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/4 c  Water
4 tb Sugar; more if desired
1/2 c  Gillyflowers (clove pink)
-(Dianthus Caryophyllus)
Lemon verbena (optional)
- finely chopped
1    Lemon; juice only
1    Egg white

Make a simple syrup with the water and sugar.  Bring to a boil and
cook over low heat till sugar is dissolved. Add gillyflowers (and
lemon verbena, if using) and remove from heat. Put a lid on the pot
and leave it on until mixture is cool.  When cool, pour into an ice
cube tray without dividers and place in the freezer. After ice
crystals have formed, transfer sorbet mixture from tray into mixing
bowl, add lemon juice (to taste) and egg white and whip.  Put back
into tray, freeze again, and whip again just prior to serving.
Garnish each serving with one perfect flower, preferably a
gillyflower.
