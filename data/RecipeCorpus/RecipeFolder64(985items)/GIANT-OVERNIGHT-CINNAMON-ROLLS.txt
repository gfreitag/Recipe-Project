MMMMM---------------------------ROLLS--------------------------------
1 pk Pillsbury Hot Roll Mix
2 tb Sugar
1 c  Water; heated to 120-130
2 tb Butter or margarine; soft
1    Egg
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/4 c  Butter or margerine; soft
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 c  Raisins
1/4 c  Finely chopped nuts
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
1 tb Butter or margarine; soft
2 tb 2-3 tb milk
1/2 ts Vanilla
Grease 13x9x2 inch pan. In large bowl, combine flour mixture with
yeast from foil packet and 2 tb sugar; blend well. Stir in HOT water,
2 tb margarine and egg until dough pulls away from sides of bowl.
Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. With greased or floured
hands, shape dough into a ball. Knead dough for 5 minutes until
smooth. Cover with large bowl; let rest 5 minutes.

On lightly floured surface, roll dough to 15x10 inch rectangle.
Spread 1/4 cup margarine or butter evenly over dough. In small bowl,
combine 1/3 cup sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle with raisins and nuts.
Starting with 10-inch side, roll up tightly, pressing edges to seal.
Cut into 6 slices and place, cut side down, into greased pan. (At
this point, dough can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated
overnight. Dough may rise in refrigerator. If necessary, let dough
stand at room temperature before baking until almost doubled in
original side. Then, bake as usual).

If baking same day, you still cover loosely with plastic wrap and
cloth towel. Let rise in warm place (80-85 degrees) until almost
doubled, about 30 minutes. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Then, uncover
dough and bake rolls for 20-30 minutes till golden brown. Cool 1
minute. Remove from pan and cool for 10 minutes. (This keeps bottom
from getting soggy.)

Drizzle glaze ingredients over rolls which may have been placed back
in pan first.

TIP: To speed up the process of rising, I heat oven to about 200
degrees for 5 minutes or so, then turn it off before putting pans in
just to rise before final baking. I do this when you can't ensure
room being at proper warmth or drafty. Otherwise, rolls will take too
long to rise and will be either heavy in consistency or too small.)
