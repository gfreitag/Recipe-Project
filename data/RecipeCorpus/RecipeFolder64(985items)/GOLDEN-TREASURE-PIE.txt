++++++++++++++ ++++ Combine the undrained pineapple, 1/2 cup of
sugar, cornstarch and water in a small saucepan. Cook over medium
heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil.  Cook
for 1 minute more. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature.
Combine the 2/3 cup of sugar and butter in a bowl, beating, using an
electric mixer set on medium speed, until well blended.  Add the
flour, cottage cheese, vanilla, and salt, beating until smooth.  Add
the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Blend in
the milk.  Pour the pineapple mixture into the unbaked pie shell and
then gradually pour the cottage cheese mixture over the pineapple
layer, being careful not to disturb the first layer. Bake at 450
degrees F. for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 325 Degrees
F. and bake for 45 minutes more, or until a knife inserted halfway
between the center and edge comes out clean.  Cool on a wire rack and
serve at room temperature.
