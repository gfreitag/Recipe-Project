Make the sauce:

1.Bring cream and Café Godiva Special Roast to simmer in heavy small
saucepan. Add chocolate; stir over low heat until smooth and mixture
begins to thicken. Add nutmeg. (Can be made one day ahead. Cover and
chill. Before serving stir over low heat just until melted.)

Make the brownies:

1.Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350
degrees F. Line a 9-inch square baking pan with 2-inch-high sides
with foil, overlapping the sides. Butter and flour the foil. 2.Stir
the first four ingredients in a heavy medium saucepan over low heat
until smooth. Cool slightly. Whisk in 1 1/2 cups sugar and the eggs.
Stir in flour, then chopped bittersweet chocolate and nuts. Transfer
to prepared pan. 3.Bake until a tester inserted into the center comes
out with moist crumbs attached, about 30 minutes. Cool on rack. (Can
be made 8 hours ahead.)

Assemble the servings:

1.Using the foil sides as an aid, lift the brownie from the pan. Fold
down the foil sides. Using a 3 3/4 inch round cookie cutter, cut out
4 rounds, preserving the scraps for another use. 2.Place one brownie
on each plate. Cover with chocolate curls. Spoon the warm sauce
around the brownies. Sift sugar over each serving.
