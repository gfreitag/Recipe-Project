Title: CALIFORNIA DIP BREAD (ABM)*
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Loaf
1 pk Yeast
3 1/3 c  Flour
1/4 ts Baking soda
1    Egg
3/4 c  Cottage cheese
3/4 c  Sour cream
3 tb Sugar
1 1/2 tb Butter
1/4 c  Water
1    Envelope Lipton's Onion
Slightly warm the next 6 ingredients and pour into pan. Select white
bread and push 'start'.

NOTE:  I have made this recipe manually, and it's fabulous. I used an
entire envelope of Lipton's Recipe Secrets (Onion), and did the
following:

Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 warm water in the bottom of large mixing
bowl. Add the butter, egg, sour cream, and cottage cheese (all
slightly warmed) and mix well. Stir in the soup mix and the sugar,
and lastly the baking soda, mixing all well.  Add the flour about 1
cup at a time, mixing thoroughly - after last addition, start using
you hands to mix and knead. Knead well (about 10-15 minutes) until
dough is elastic (my dough was too sticky and I ended up adding a
little additional flour). Let rise until double (about 1 1/2 hours)
in a lightly greased bowl (<-- important! I didn't grease the bowl
and it got sticky on the bottom); punch down and knead lightly. Place
dough in greased baking container of choice, and let rise again until
double again (about another 45 minutes). Bake at 350 degrees for
40-45 minutes, or until cake tester comes out clean. Remove from pan
immediately and cool completely on cooling rack. This recipe made
enough for 1 loaf in my breadcrock (about 3/4 of the dough), and the
remaining 1/4 made 2 mini-loaves. The mini-loaves, however, only bake
about 15 minutes or so.  Would probably produce two regular-sized
loaf pans of bread. Would be excellent with deli meats or used
grilled for other sandwiches! The mini-loaves or a decorative tube
pan would turn it into wonderful cocktail bread.  Tastes like a very
moist, slightly sweet double-onion bagel.  I am anxious to use this
same recipe and experiment with other soup mixes!!
