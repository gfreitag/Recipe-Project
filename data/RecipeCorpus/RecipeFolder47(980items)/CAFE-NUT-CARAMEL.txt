Title: CAFE NUT CARAMEL
Categories: Desserts, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
1 cn Eagle Brand Condensed Milk
-(caramelized)
1/4 c  Hot coffee
1/2 c  Pecan nut meats
(This recipe earned $25 for Mrs. George H. Plum, 440 Camden Ave.,
Moorestown, New Jersey.)

Blend caramelized Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk (see Magic
Caramel Pudding recipe), and hot coffee, beating until smooth. Chop
pecan nut meats and add. Pour into sherbet glasses. Chill. May be
garnished with whipped cream.  Serves six.

NOTE:  I have just completed assembling the above recipe. Tastes
good. If it sets up a bit more it will make a nice pudding. If it was
heated, it would be nice over a couple of scoops of vanilla ice
cream. No way it's gonna serve six, though.
