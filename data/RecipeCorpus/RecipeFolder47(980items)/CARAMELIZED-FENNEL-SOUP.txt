Title: CARAMELIZED FENNEL SOUP
Categories: Soups
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Fennel bulbs; trim/mince
6 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
4 c  Vegetable or chicken broth
1/2 c  Whipping cream; opt
Sea salt; to taste
MMMMM-----------------------BOUQUET GARNI----------------------------
Fresh rosemary
Fresh parsley
Bay leaf
Fresh thyme
Tie together with twine
1. Combine fennel and oil in large, heavy-bottomed stockpot. Stir to
coat fennel with oil. Cook, covered, over low heat 10 minutes,
stirring occasionally. If fennel burns it will give the soup a bitter
taste.

2. Remove lid; continue to cook over low heat. Pieces should gradually
brown and caramelize. Add bouquet garni and broth; simmer; covered, 30
minutes.

3. Discard bouquet garni. Using an immersion blender, roughly puree
soup in stockpot. (Alternatively, pass soup through coarse blade of
food mill or puree coarsely in batches in food processor; and return
to stockpot.) Soup should be creamy but not totally smooth. Stir in
cream, if using; reheat. Taste for seasoning. Serve piping hot in
warmed shallow soup bowls.

NOTE: Fennel has a tough outer skin. It's well worth it to peel it
with a vegetable peeler.
