Title: CANDIED MINT LEAVES
Categories: Candies, Desserts, Snacks
Yield: 10 Servings
40    Apple or Pineapple Mint
-Leaves (select tender
-leaves with no blemishes)
2    Egg whites (may need more)
Water
Powdered sugar
The large downy leaves of the apple and pineapple mint leaves take up
this coating very well which will not readily adhere to most of the
varieties of the mint. This is a nice confection that has many uses.
******************************************************* **************
Froth up the egg whites with a little water. With a small brush,
paint the leaves with the egg white and dust both sides with the
powdered sugar. Set each leaf on a sheet of wax paper and allow to
dry. They will dry with a frosty crystalized coating and make a nice
garnish for desserts or a pleasant candy treat.
