to form thin layer. Arrange half of strawberry slices and all of kiwi
slices in decorative pattern, handling kiwis as little as possible.

mango slices over surface to form another layer. Spoon over more
gelatin mixture to cover fruit. Again, allow to set. Top with layer
of remaining sliced strawberries. Spoon over more gelatin mixture to
cover berries. Allow to set. Top with papaya slices. Pour over
remaining gelatin mixture. Chill until completely set.

To make dressing, blend honey, mayonnaise and whipped cream. Add fruit
puree. Unmold terrine onto serving platter and cut into slices about
3/4-inch thick. Serve each slice with dollop of dressing. Garnish
with mint sprigs and more fresh fruit, if desired.
