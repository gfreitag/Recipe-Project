1    Capon about 6 lbs
Juice of 2 lemons
1/4 c  All-purpose flour
Salt and pepper
1 c  Butter
1/2 lb Bacon; diced
5 sm Yellow onions
3/4 c  Irish whisky
1    Garlic clove
1/2 ts Ground allspice
1 c  Dry red wine
1 c  ;water
2    Egg yolks
2 tb Light cream
1 lb Pearl onions
1 lb Mushrooms
Cut up capon as for fricassee.  Dip pieces into lemon juice and then
into 3 tablespoons flour, seasoned with salt and pepper. Brown in
butter. Add bacon and small yellow onions; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon
flour, and brown again.  Flame capon with Irish whisky. Add salt,
pepper, garlic, and allspice.  Cover with wine and simmer gently for
60 minutes or until done.

For the sauce make a broth with the neck, feet, and giblets. Strain
off the liquor from the bird and add to the broth. Reduce to half by
rapid boiling. Thicken with raw egg yolks beaten with cream; reheat
but do not boil after adding egg.

Serve capon in a dish garnished with the pearl onions and mushrooms,
each cooked separately in water and lemon juice. Pour part of the
sauce over the capon and serve the remainder separately. Makes 8 to
10 servings. Source: Woman's Day Encyclopedia of Cookery.
