Drain watermelon honey until all the tiny particles of melon are
comparatively free from sirup.  Prepare a heavy sirup made of 2 parts
sugar and 1 part water. Tint a delicate green with food coloring.
Flavor with mint.  Add the drained particles.  Simmer until nicely
colored. Drain. Roll in granulated sugar.  Dry in very slow oven (300
F). A portion of the sirup may be colored pink and flavored with rose
or raspberry before the melon is added.  If the natural color is
desired, roll the drained particles in sugar, and dry. Any variety of
flavors and colors may be obtained. The Household Searchlight
