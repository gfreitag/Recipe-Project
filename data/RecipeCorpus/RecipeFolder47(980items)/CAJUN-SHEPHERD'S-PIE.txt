MMMMM-------------------------VEGETABLES------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Julienned zucchini (see note
1 c  Julienned squash (see Note)
1 x  Very Hot Cajun Sauce/Beef
NOTE:  To julienne squashes, cut peelings 1/8 inch thick and cut
these
into strips 1/8 inch wide and 2 inches long; use only strips that
have
skin on one surface.  Cut carrots and onions into similar strips.
In a 13x9-inch ungreased baking pan, combine the beef and pork. Mix
in the eggs and bread crumbs by hand until thoroughly mixed. Set
aside.    In a 1-quart saucepan, combine 3 tablespoons of the
butter,
the onions, celery, bell peppers, garlic, Worcestershire, Tabasco
and
meat seasoning mix.  Saute over high heat about 5 minutes, stirring
frequently and scraping the pan bottom well.  Remove from heat and
cool.  Add the sauteed vegetable mixture and 1/4 cup of the milk to
the meat and mix well by hand.  Form into a 12x8-inch loaf and
center
in the pan.  Bake at 450F until brown on top, about
30    minutes.
Remove from oven; pour off drippings, reserve 2-1/2 tablespoons. Set
meat and drippings aside.    Meanwhile, boil the potatoes until fork
tender; drain, reserving about 1 cup of the water. Place the
potatoes, while still hot, in a large mixing bowl with the
remaining 1
stick butter, 1/2 cup milk, the salt and white pepper. Stir with a
wooden spoon until broken up, then beat with a metal whisk (or
electric mixer with a paddle) until creamy and velvety smooth.
(NOTE:
Mix in some of the reserved potato water if potatoes are not creamy
enough.)  In a large skillet (preferably non-stick) combine the
reserved drippings with the carrots, onions and vegetable seasoning
mix; saute over high heat 1-1/2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add
the
zucchini and yellow squash and continue sauteing until vegetables
are
noticeably brighter in color, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring
occasionally.  Remove from heat.    Mound undrained vegetables on
top
of the meat loaf, away from the edges.  Layer the mashed potatoes
evenly over the top of the vegetables and top edges of the meat,
using
all the potatoes.  Bake at 525F until brown on top, about 8 to 10
minutes.  Serve immediately with about 1/2 cup Very Hot Cajun Sauce
(see recipe) under each serving. From Paul Prudhommes "Louisiana
