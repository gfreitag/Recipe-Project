MMMMM--------------------------COOKIES-------------------------------
1 c  Brown sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Butter, softened
1    Egg
1/2 ts Vanilla
1 3/4 c  Flour, sifted
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Cinnamon
MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar
1    Egg white,
-slightly beaten
1 tb Butter, melted
1/8 ts Salt
1/2 ts Vanilla
Food coloring
-(optional)
Mix sugar, salt and butter thoroughly.  Add egg and vanilla and beat
till fluffy.

Sift flour, baking powder, soda and cinnamon and add to mixture. Chill
well, several hours, or overnight.

MAKE THE GLAZE:  Mix the glaze ingredients together until smooth.

Roll the dough out until it is about 1/8 inch thick. Cut into fancy
shapes and bake on ungreased cookie sheet for 8-10 minutes at 350
degrees F. Let cool and glaze.

NOTES:

*  Rolled cookies for the Christmas holidays -- I almost never make
these cookies except at Christmas time. They just seem to be
Christmas cookies.
(I did make a batch of heart shaped ones last Valentine's day for my
then-fiance.)  I usually make these cookies in Christmas shapes and
frost them with green and red frosting. This is a good recipe for
kids to help out with.

*  It helps to keep most of the dough in the refrigerator while you
are cutting shapes.  It cuts much better when it is cold.

*  These are time-consuming and fairly difficult, but worth it.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, overnight chill, 1 hour cutting and
baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
