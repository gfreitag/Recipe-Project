Title: CANDYCANE'S BROWNIES
Categories: Brownies
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 c  Butter (1 1/2 sticks)
4 oz Unsweetened baking choc.
2 c  Sugar
3    Eggs
1 ts Vanilla
1 c  Flour
1 c  Nuts, chopped
10 x  Caramels (Kraft)
In large bowl, melt butter and chocolate in microwave for 5 minutes,
or in pan on stove over low heat (if in pan, stir constantly). Stir
until completely melted. Add sugar and mix til sugar is absorbed by
chocolate. Add eggs and vanilla and stir, then add flour and stir til
lumps are gone, don't stir more than that.  Mix in nuts. Pour thin
layer of batter into greased 8x12 pan (just enough to cover the
bottom). Melt carmel in microwave for 30 seconds, or in pan until
soft. The carmel will still be in squares, but it will be warm and
soft. With fingers, flatten squares into larger squares and put on
top of brownie layer. Add the rest of the batter. Bake at 350 for 35
to 40 minutes.
