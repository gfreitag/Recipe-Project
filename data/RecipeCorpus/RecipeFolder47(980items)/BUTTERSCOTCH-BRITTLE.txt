Title: BUTTERSCOTCH BRITTLE
Categories: Candies
Yield: 1 Batch
2 c  C&H Golden Brown Sugar
1 c  Light corn syrup
1/4 c  Water
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
Combine sugar, syrup, water, and salt in a 3-quart saucepan. Slowly
bring to a boil, stirring constantly until sugar completely
dissolves, then frequently to prevent burning. Boil to 285 degrees
(soft-crack stage). Add butter and continue to cook, stirring
constantly until temperature reaches 295 degree (hard-crack stage).
Remove from heat; let set a minute until bubbling stops.  Pour into a
well-buttered 13x9-inch pan. Cool, then break into pieces. Makes
about 1-1/2 pounds.
