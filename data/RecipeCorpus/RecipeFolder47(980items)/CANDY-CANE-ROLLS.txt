Title: CANDY CANE ROLLS
Categories: Breads, Holiday
Yield: 24 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water (110ø to 115øF)
3/4 c  Warm milk  (110ø to 115øF)
1/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Shortening
1 ts Salt
1    Egg, lightly beaten
3 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Candied cherries, quartered
1 c  Confectioner's sugar
1 tb Milk
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add warm milk,
sugar, shortening, salt, egg and 2 cups flour; beat until smooth.
Stir in cherries.  Add enough of the remaining flour to form a soft
dough. Turn onto a floured board; knead until smooth and elastic,
about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease
top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down; let rest for about 10 minutes.  Divide dough into
half. Roll each half into a 12x7-inch rectangle. Cut twelve 1-inch
strips from each rectangle. Twist each strip and place 2-inches apart
on greased baking sheets, shaping one end like a cane.  Cover and let
rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375øF for 12-15 minutes
or until golden brown.  Cool completely. Combine confectioner's sugar
and milk; frost rolls.
