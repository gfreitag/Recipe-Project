The flavor of this golden brown fudge comes from the caramelized
sugar. Combine 4 cups sugar and cream in a heavy 4-quart saucepan.
Set aside. Melt 2 cups sugar in a heavy 10-inch skillet over medium
heat. Stir sugar constantly until it begins to melt. Heat sugar-cream
mixture over medium heat. Continue melting sugar in skillet, stirring
and watching closely so it does not scorch. As soon as it is
completely melted, por liquid sugar in a thin stream into boiling
sugar-cream mixture, stirring constantly. Do not let sugar remain
over heat after completely melted; this will produced a scorched
taste. Cook com- bined mixtures to 246 degrees F. Remove from heat
and add baking soda and butter. Stir in and let candy stand for 30
minutes. Add nuts. Stir to mix; pour into buttered 9-inch square
pans. Cool slightly and cut into squares. Makes about 78 pieces.
