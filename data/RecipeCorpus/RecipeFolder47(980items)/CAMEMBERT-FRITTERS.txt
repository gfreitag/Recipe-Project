Veg. oil for dep fat frying

Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over med. heat. Quickly blend in
the flour. Add the milk gradually, stirring thoroughly. Bring to a
boil, reduce the heat, and cook slowly until the sauce is thickened
and smooth, about 4 minutes.  Add the cheese to the sauce and stir
until it has melted. Add salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Remove
from the heat and allow the sauce to cool slightly. Spread the
mixture 3/4 inch thick on a baking sheet. Cover lightly, place in the
refrigerator, and leave until cool and firm--about 2 hours or
overnight. Cut the cheese mixture into squares, or use a 1 1/2 inch
round cookie cutter. Beat the eggs with the water. Roll the cheese
pieces in the bread crumbs, then dip them in the egg mixture. Roll
them in the crumbs again, and shake off any excess crumbs. Heat the
veg. oil to 375 F. in a deep-fat fryer or heavy saucepan. Drop the
cheese pieces a few at a time into the oil. DO NOT CROWD THE PAN. Fry
just until they are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on paper
towels. Serve hot. Makes 10 to 12 fritters.
