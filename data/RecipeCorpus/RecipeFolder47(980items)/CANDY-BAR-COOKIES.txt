In large bowl, combine all base ingredients except flour; blend

flour; mix well. If necessary, refrigerate dough for easier handling.
Heat oven to 325 degrees.  On well-floured surface, roll half of
dough to 12 x 8 inch rectangle. Using pastry wheel or knife, cut into
2 inch squares. Place 1/2 inch apart on ungreased cookies sheets.
Bake at 325 degrees for 12 to 16 minutes or until set. Cool on wire
racks. Repeat with remaining dough.
In medium saucepan, combine caramels, 1/4 c whipping cream and
1/4 c butter; cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until caramels
are melted and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat; stir in 1 c
powdered sugar and chopped pecans.  (Add additional whipping cream a
few drops at a time, if needed for desired spreading consistency.)
Spread 1 t of warm filling on each cookie square.
In small saucepan, combine chocolate chips, 2 T whipping cream
and 1 T butter; cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until
chocolate chips are melted and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat;
stir in 1/4 c powdered sugar and 1 t vanilla.  Spread glaze over
caramel filling. Top each cookie with a pecan half.

Cool. Prepare filling as directed above; spread over base. Prepare
