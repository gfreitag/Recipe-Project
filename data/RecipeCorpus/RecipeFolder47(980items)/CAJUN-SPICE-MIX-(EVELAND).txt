Title: CAJUN SPICE MIX (EVELAND)
Categories: Spices
Yield: 1 Servings
-Cajun
1/2 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Red pepper
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Onion powder
1/4 ts Thyme (ground)
1/4 ts Oregano
1/4 ts White pepper
Mix ingredients together and store in air tight container.

This spice mix is loosly based on a spice mix from the Prudhomme
Family Cookbook's recipe for Fried Catfish and Sweet Hushpuppies. It
can be used to season any seafood dish. I also use it to season
Porcupine Meatballs and other "cajun" inspired dishes.
