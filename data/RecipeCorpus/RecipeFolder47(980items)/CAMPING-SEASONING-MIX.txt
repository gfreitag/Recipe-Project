Title: CAMPING SEASONING MIX
Categories:
Yield: 25 Servings
1/3 c  Salt
1 tb Paprika
1 tb Garlic Powder
2 ts Onion Powder
1/2 ts Cayenne or substitute Curry
1/2 ts Pepper
Mix well and store in a double zip-lock bag or a good screw-top
container. I usually make up 2 or 3 combinations when back-packing so
that I have seasoning for meats, fish or the ubiquitous curry.
