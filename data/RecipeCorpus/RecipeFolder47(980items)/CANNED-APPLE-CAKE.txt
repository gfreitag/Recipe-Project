Title: CANNED APPLE CAKE
Categories: Cakes, Preserves, Fruits, Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
2/3 c  Shortening
1/2 ts Baking powder
3 1/3 c  Sugar
2 ts Baking soda
4    Eggs
1 1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Applesauce
1 ts Cinnamon (ground)
3 1/3 c  Flour
1 ts Cloves (ground)
1 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Pecans (chopped)
Grease 8 WIDE-MOUTH pint canning jars with melted shortening. Use a
brush and avoid getting grease on the jar rims. Cream shortening and
sugar. Beat in eggs and applesauce. Sift together the dry ingredients
and blend them into the applesauce mixture.  Add the raisins and nuts
and divide the batter evenly between 8 widemouth pint jars. The jars
will be more than half full.  Bake open jars about 60 minutes in an
oven at 325 degrees. When done, quickly remove one hot jar at a time
and clean its sealing edge. Immediately apply and firmly tighten a
two-piece wide-mouth canning lid. The lid will form a vacuum seal as
the jar cools. Jars of cooled bread may be stored on the pantry shelf
with other canned foods or may be placed in a freezer.  The bread is
safe to eat as long as jars remain vacuum sealed and free of mold
growth.

NOTE: The lady who contributed this recipe to the magazine noted that
she had some of this cake that is one year old and is still
delicious. I have personally made this and have several jars that are
still good over 5 months later.  I plan to save one jar from my
original batch and see how long it will keep. (Nancy)
