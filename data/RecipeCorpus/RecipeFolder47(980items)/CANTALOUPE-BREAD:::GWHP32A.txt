* Make Canteloupe liquid in a blender from approximately 1 1/2 cups of
seeded and peeled ripe cantaloupe chunks, then heated. Place all
ingredients into the pan in the order listed, set darkness control at
10 o'clock Select white bread and push "Start." This is a soft,
sticky dough. If any of it clings to the sides ofthe pan at the end
of the first kneading, you can push it down with a rubber spatula.
This unbelievably delicious bread is based on an equally unbelievable
Texas treat consisting of peeled cantaloupe segments arranged on a
serving plate in a sunburst pattern with bread cubes piled in the
center and covered with cream sauce,then dusted with paprika and/or
dotted with "red jelly." You can spread your own jelly on these
slices, perhaps over a layer of cream cheesefluffed with mashed
cantaloupe, to savor the full range often tantalizing tastes. Shared
