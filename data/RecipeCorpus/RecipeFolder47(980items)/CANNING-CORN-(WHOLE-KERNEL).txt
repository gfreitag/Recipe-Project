Title: CANNING CORN (WHOLE KERNEL)
Categories: Vegetables, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Quantity: An average of 31-1/2 pounds (in huss) of sweet corn is
needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 20 pounds is needed
per canner load of 9 pints. A bushel weighs 35 pounds and yields 6 to
11 quarts--an average of 4-1/2 pounds per quart.

Quality: Select ears containing slightly immature kernels or of ideal
quality for eating fresh. Canning of some sweeter varieties or too
immature kernels may cause browning. Can a small amount, check color
and flavor before canning large quantities.

Procedure: Husk corn, remove silk, and wash. Blanch 3 minutes in
boiling water. Cut corn from cob at about three-fourths the depth of
kernel. Caution: Do not scrape cob.

Hot pack--To each clean quart of kernels in a saucepan, add 1 cup of
hot water, heat to boiling and simmer 5 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of
salt per quart to the jar, if desired. Fill jars with corn and
cooking liquid, leaving 1-inch headspace.

Raw pack--Fill jars with raw kernels, leaving 1-inch headspace. Do not
shake or press down. Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart to the jar, if
desired.

Add fresh boiling water, leaving 1-inch headspace.

Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 or
Table 2 according the the method of canning used.
