Title: CARAMELIZED BANANA MOUSSE
Categories: Fruits, Desserts, Yogurt
Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Butter
1/2 c  Brown sugar
2 c  Sliced bananas
1/2 c  Plain yogurt
2    Egg yolks
1/3 c  Sugar
1 pk Unflavored gelatin
4 oz Orange juice
3 c  Whipping cream
3 tb Sugar
2    Egg whites
Chopped walnuts for garnish
Melt butter in nonstick frying pan.  Add brown sugar and bananas.
Saute bananas until they are well coated and soft. Remove from heat
and let cool a few minutes. Add yogurt and puree with bananas in
blender. Beat egg yolks and 1/3 cup sugar in stainless stell bowl
over hot water bath or top half of double boiler until mixture
lightens in color and becomes fluffy (about 2 minutes). Add gelatin
that has been softened in orange juice to egg mixture and continue

beating for another 2 minutes.  Remove mixture from heat and combine
with banana puree, mixing thoroughly. Refrigerate for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, whip cream and 3 tbsp sugar into soft peaks. Beat egg
whites until they form firm peaks. Fold 2/3 of the whipped cream
(reserving 1/3 for garnish) into the chilled banana puree. Fold in
egg whites. Chill for 4-6 hours. Top with remaining whipped cream and
chipped walnuts. Serve 6-8.
