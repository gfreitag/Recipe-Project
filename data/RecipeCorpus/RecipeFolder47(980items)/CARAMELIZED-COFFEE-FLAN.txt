Place sugar in a small heavy saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly with a wooden spoon, until sugar crystallizes into lumps
(about 15 minutes). Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until
sugar melts and turns a light golden brown (about 15 minutes).
Quickly pour hot caramel mixture into an ungreased 8-inch round
cakepan, tilting to coat bottom evenly. Set aside (mixture will
harden).

Combine eggs and remaining ingredients in a large bowl; beat with a
wire whisk until coffee granules dissolve. Pour egg mixture over
caramelized sugar in cakepan.

Place cakepan in a large shallow baking dish. Pour hot water into
outer baking dish to a depth of 1-inch. Cover with aluminum foil, and
bake at 350 degrees F. for 55 minutes or until a knife inserted near
center of flan comes out clean. Remove pan from water, and let cool.
Cover and chill at least 8 hours.

To serve, loosen edge of custard with a spatula, and invert onto a
serving plate.
