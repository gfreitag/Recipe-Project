Categories: Cajun, Salads
Yield: 10 Servings
5 tb Mayonnaise, (heaping)
1 ts Louisiana hot sauce
2 tb Yellow mustard (heaping)
2 tb Ketchup
2 tb Olive oil
1 tb Wine vinegar
1 ts Garlic salt
1 tb Lea & perrins
1 ea Juice of mediums size lemon
3 ts Salt (to taste)
4 ea Bell peppers, sliced
2 ea Onions, medium, shredded
1 ea Large cabbage, shredded
Put mayonnaise and mustard in a bowl large enough to hold complete
mixture, but shaped so that the mixture can be beaten with a fork.
Beat mayonnaise and mustard until combined. Add olive oil slowly,
beating all the time. Beat until mixture has returned to the
thickness of original mayonnaise. Add Louisiana hot sauce, continuing
to beat. Add ketchup and keep beating. Add salt and garlic salt,
beating all the time. Add wine vinegar (this will thin the sauce
down). Beat this thoroughly, adding the lemon juice as you do so.
Taste for salt and pepper. Place shredded cabbage, peppers, and
onions in a large salad bowl. pour sauce over and toss well. This
should be done about an hour before serving. Tastes even better the
next day. From Justin Wilson's "Outdoor Cooking With Inside Help"
