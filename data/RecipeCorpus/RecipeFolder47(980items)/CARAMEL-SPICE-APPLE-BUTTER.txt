Title: CARAMEL SPICE APPLE BUTTER
Categories: Preserves, Jams
Yield: 6 Servings
4 lb Rome apples
4 1/2 lb Granny Smith apples
1 c  Water
4 c  Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Cloves
1/4 ts Ginger
2 tb Lemon juice
Wash apples and cut into pieces; combine with water in a large covered
sauce pot.  Cook until soft, about 30 minutes. Press through a food
mill; measure 12 cups apple pulp; and return to sauce pot. Heat 2
cups sugar in a saucepan, stirring until sugar melts and turns a rich
golden brown. Carefully pour into apple pulp. Sugar will crackle and
harden. Add remaining 2 cups of sugar and spices. Cook, uncovered,
about 1 hour or until apple butter thickens, stirring occasionally to
prevent sticking. Stir in lemon juice. Pour hot into hot jars,
leaving 1/4 inch head space. Adjust caps.  Process 10 minutes in
boiling water bath. Yield: 6 half pints.
