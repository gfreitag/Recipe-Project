1. In a heavy saucepan, saut the shallots in the olive oil over
medium heat until they begin to color, 3-5 minutes. Add the garlic
and saut for 1 minute.

2. Add the flour; stir and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine, stock ,
pine nuts, parsley, salt and pepper. cook over medium heat until the
sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. If using cilantro, add it now.

3. Process the sauce in a blender or food processor. The blender
yields a smooth sauce; the food processor, a finely minced one.
