Title: CAJUN CHICKEN MORSELS
Categories: Appetizers, Poultry
Yield: 8 Servings
1 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
1 c  Pecans -- chopped
1 tb Dried oregano
2 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Dried thyme
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
Salt -- to taste
12 tb Unsalted butter
4    Whole chicken breasts
Without skin -- boned
(cut into 1" pieces)
Combine the flour, pecans, oregano, cumin, thyme, cayenne, and salt to
taste in a shallow dish. Melt 6 tablespoons of the butter in a small
saucepan. Dip each chicken piece first in the butter, then in the
flour mixture to coat well. Melt 3 tablespoons of the remaining
butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add half the chicken
pieces and saute until browned on all sides and cooked through.
Remove from the pan and keep warm.  Repeat with the remaining 3
tablespoons of butter and the chicken. Serve the chicken morsels with
toothpicks and your favorite mustard for dipping.
