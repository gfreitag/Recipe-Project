Title: CALZONE WITH SUN-DRIED TOMATOES
Categories: Italian, Pizza
Yield: 4 Servings
Deep-Dish Pizza Dough
1 tb Oil from sun-dried tomatoes
1 md Onion, finely chopped
1    Clove garlic, minced
Or pressed
1 c  (8 oz) ricotta cheese
1/4 c  Chopped sun-dried tomatoes
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1/4 lb Sliced prosciutto or dry
Salami, cut into strips
2 c  (1/2 lb) shredded whole-
Milk mozzarella cheese
Cornmeal (for baking sheet)
Olive oil
1. Prepare Deep-Dish Pizza Dough and let it rise.

2. While dough rises, prepare filling. In a medium frying pan heat
tomato oil over moderate heat; add onion and cook, stirring often,
until soft but not browned. Mix in garlic, then remove from heat.

3. In a medium bowl mix ricotta cheese with dried tomatoes and
parsley; stir in cooked onion mixture.

4. Divide dough into two equal portions. Roll each half out on a
floured suface to a 12-inch circle. Spread half of the ricotta
filling over half of each circle of dough, leaving about a 1/2-inch
margin.

5. Sprinkle half of each circle with half of the prosciutto strips
and 1 cup of the mozarella cheese. Fold circles in halves over
filling, moistening and pinching edges together (or pressing with
tines of a fork) to seal.

6. Preheat oven to 450~ F. Sprinkle a large, greased baking sheet
lightly with cornmeal. Place calzone well apart on prepared baking
sheet. Let rise until puffy (12 to 15 minutes). Brush tops lightly
with olive oil, then serve hot.
