In a two quart heavy bottom sauce pan, melt butter over medium high
heat. Add garlic, green onions, mushrooms, tomatoes and andouille.
Saute three to five minutes or until all vegetables are wilted. Add
shrimp, crabmeat and crawfish. Cook for an additional ten minutes.
Deglaze pan with white wine and lemon juice, and continue cooking
until volume of liquid is reduced to one half. Add heavy whipping
cream and, stirring constantly, reduce until cream is thick and of a
sauce like consistency, approximately five minutes. Add diced red
bell pepper and chipped butter, two to three pats at a time, swirling
pan constantly over burner. Do not stir with a spoon, as butter will
break down and separate if hot spots develop in the pan. Continue
adding butter until all is incorporated. Remove from heat, add
parsley and season to taste using salt and pepper. Gently fold in
cooked fettuccine and serve. May be chilled and served as a cold
pasta salad.
