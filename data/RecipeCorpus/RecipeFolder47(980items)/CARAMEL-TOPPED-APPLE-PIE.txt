Title: CARAMEL TOPPED APPLE PIE
Categories: Pies
Yield: 8 Servings
5 1/2 c  Peeled, sliced tart apples
-(about 2 lbs.)
1/4 c  Water
Unbaked 9" pastry shell
3/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Graham cracker crumbs
1 tb All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 c  Chopped pecans
1/3 c  Butter or margarine, melted
1/2 lb Vanilla caramels *
1/2 c  Milk
* Make this pie with the popular cellophane-wrapped caramels sold in
supermarkets, or try candy-shop or gourmet caramels, if you like.

In a 3- to 4-quart pan, combine apples and water. Bring to a boil;
boil for 1 minute, then pour into a 10- by 15-inch rimmed baking pan
to cool quickly. When cool, spoon apples into pastry shell.

Combine sugar, cracker crumbs, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, pecans, and
butter; sprinkle over apples. Bake in a 425 degree oven for 10
minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350, continue to bake until
apples are tender when pierced, 20 more minutes.

Meanwhile, combine caramels and milk in the top of a double boiler.
Stir over simmering water until melted and smooth. Pour caramel sauce
over pie; continue to bake until caramel just begins to bubble at pie
edges, about 10 more minutes.  Let cool.

Preparation Time:  About 35 minutes (includes 10 minutes for sauce)

NOTES: I have wondered if a caramel ice cream topping would work just
as well, however, I have not tried substituting.
