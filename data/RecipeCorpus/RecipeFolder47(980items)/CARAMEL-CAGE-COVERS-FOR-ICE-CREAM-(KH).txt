Title: CARAMEL CAGE COVERS FOR ICE CREAM (KH)
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 c  Water
1 c  Sugar
1 pn Cream of tartar
Aluminum foil
6 oz Ladle
Vegetable oil
Candy thermometer
Cover the outside (rounded part) of a 6 oz ladle with aluminum foil.
Making sure to keep the surface smooth and tight. Lightly oil the
domed surface of foil.

Now pour into a saucepan the sugar, water and cream of tartar. Shake
the pan to mix and cover. Heat this covered mixture over medium low
heat until the sugar dissolves. Remove lid and continue cooking the
syrp until it turns a light gold color (about 340 degrees F. on candy
thermometer).

Remove the pan from the heat and let sit at room temperature for 6-8
minutes. The syrup will turn a darker gold color.

Now you are ready to make the cages. Just hold the foil covered ladle
over the pan, dip a spoon into the caramel mixture and drizzle over
ladle, moving you hand around in a swirling motion to form a wed or
lattice pattern on the foil. Prop up the ladle so the caramel cage
cools completely (about 10 minutes).

Pry foil away from the ladle carefully so as not to break the fragile
cage. Trim away the uneven strands with scissors to form a nice
straight bottom. Now carefully peel off the foil and you have a
beautiful candy cage to place over a single scoop of ice cream. Try
to find a dish so the cage fits on the edge of the dish. Instruct
your guests to tap the cage with the back of a spoon and enjoy the
special effect.
