Title: CANDIED ORANGE PEEL
Categories: Fruits, Holiday
Yield: 3 Servings
INGREDIENTS:
8    Oranges
Water
1 c  Boiling water
4 c  Sugar
Makes about 3-4 lbs of candy.

(TIP):   Collect  the  orange  halves over a period of time and
refrigerate them in a plastic bag until you have enough to prepare
candied peel. You may candy *whole* orange halves, if you wish.
Just boile them without cutting them into strips. When cooled, they
make lovely containers for candies and nuts, or holiday desserts.

Wash the oranges.  Cut into halves and squeeze out the juice. Use the
juice for some other purpose,  of course. Place the oranges into a
large saucepan and cover with cold water.

Place over high heat and heat to a boil.   Add cold water to cover
again. Heat to a boil and drain.
Repeat this process five times in all. Drain well and scoop out the
pulp. Cut the oranges into 1/4 inch wide strips.

Combine  1 cup of boiling water with 2 cups of the sugar. Heat until
the sugar is dissolved.   Stir in the orange strips. Place over
medium heat and boil for about 30  minutes,  until  all  the liquid
is evaporated. Watch carefully so the peels don't scorch.
Cool.   Roll the strips  in  the remaining 2 cups of sugar. Place on
waxed paper  to  dry. Package and store in airtight containers.
