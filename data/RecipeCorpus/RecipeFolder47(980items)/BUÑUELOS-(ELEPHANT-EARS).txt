Yield: 6 Servings
1 pk Yeast, dry
1 c  ;Water, warm
2    Egg; beaten
4 c  Flour

Soften yeast in warm water.  Combine all ingredients except cinnamon
sugar; mix well.  Divide dough into 12 pieces. Let rest for 10
minutes. Roll each piece out on a lightly floured board. Using your
hands, stretch each piece into a circular shape.

Heat vegetable oil in a 10-inch skillet (cast iron is the best).

surface will bubble and blister and should be lightly browned.

sugar.
