Title: CANDY MELT ROSES
Categories: Candies
Yield: 6 Servings
14 oz Candy Melts - (1 package)
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
Melt candy melts according to package directions.  Add heated light
corn syrup and stir until thoroughly mixed. Let set at room
temperature in an airtight plastic bag for at least 24 hours or up to
one week. Candy becomes easier to work with as it sets.  When ready
to use, knead a small amount until it reaches a workable consistency.

MODELING A ROSE: Start with the base and mold a cone that's
approximately 1-1/2 inch high from a 3/4-inch diameter ball of
modeling candy. Next, make petals. Flatten 3/8-inch ball of modeling
candy into a circle that's about 1/4-inch thick on one side and about
the diameter of a dime. Make several petals this size. Wrap first
petal around the point of the cone to form a bud.  Now press three
more petals around the base of the bud. Gently pinch edges of petals.
Make five more petals using slightly larger balls of modeling candy.
Flatten, then thin edge with finger and cup petals. Press petals
under first row of petals. Continue adding petals, placing them in
between and slightly lower than previous row. For a fuller flower,
continue adding petals in this manner.

TO MAKE CANDY LEAVES: On the back of clean, thoroughly dried, grape
or rose leaves, paint on melted Candy Melts with a soft pastry or
decorator's brush. Pull out pointed or curved edges to resemble
certain kinds of leaves. Let coating set and when completely dry,
carefully peel off candy.
