Pour oil from above into bottom of stock pot, adding enough to cover
the bottom of the pot, if necessary. Make a roux by adding an equal
amount of flour, cooking until thickened. Add the following:

Simmer for 25 minutes.  Add drained tofu, place lid on pot and simmer
for another 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 3 or 4 fresh bay
leaves and let cool for 15 minutes. Reheat if necessary and serve

reduced to taste.
