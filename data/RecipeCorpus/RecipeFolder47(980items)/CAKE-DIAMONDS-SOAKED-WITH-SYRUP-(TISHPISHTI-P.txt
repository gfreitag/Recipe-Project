2 tb Honey
1 ts Lemon juice; preferably
-fresh
For the dough, combine the matzo meal, cake meal, 1/2 cup sugar,
ground almonds, cinnamon, and cloves in a medium-sized bowl. Add the
oil, egg, and 3/4 cup water, and mix very well for form a stiff
dough. Knead the dough with your hands a few times to complete the
mixing. Evenly press the dough into a greased 8-inch-square baking
pan. Use a knife to cut the dough into diamonds.  First, cut the
dough crosswise into about 4 even rows. Then make diagonal, parallel
cuts through the rows. (If desired, cut the dough into squares,
instead.)  Press a whole almond into the center of each piece. Bake
the cake in a preheated 375-degree oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or
until it is browned and firm.

Meanwhile, prepare the syrup.  Put the sugar and water into a small
saucepan.  Stir over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves and
the syrup comes to a boil; then boil the syrup, uncovered and
undisturbed, for 8 minutes.  Stir in the honey and lemon juice.
Remove the syrup from the heat, and set it aside to cool slightly.

When the cake has finished baking, remove it from the oven, and recut
the pieces.  Pour the syrup evenly over the hot cake. Let the cake
rest for several hours to completely absorb the syrup. After the
syrup has been absorbed, cover the cake with aluminum foil or plastic
wrap and store it at room temperature. Makes about 16 pieces. Source:

Note:  This is a passover version of a cake popular with Turkish and
Greek Jews throughout the year.  The cake is soaked in a sugar-honey
syrup after it is baked. For best flavor and texture, tishpishti
should be made at least one day ahead.  It will stay well for several
days.
