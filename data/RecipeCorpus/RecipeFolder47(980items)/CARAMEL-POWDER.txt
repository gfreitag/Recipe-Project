For years one of my favorite things has been the sheets of "caramel"
that resulted when I baked a ham and the glazing ran down onto the
foil lined baking pan, then set up. Never occurred to me to use it in
a recipe, but it did to someone at Sunset Magazine.  The illustration
in the magazine shows the flan garnished with crunched up chunks of
the un powdered caramel.

Line a 10- by 15-inch baking pan with a single sheet of foil, folding
up at edges.

Pour 2 cups sugar into a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan, place
over medium-high heat. Shake pan often until most of the sugar
liquefies, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; tilt pan to mix
hot caramel with sugar until all is melted and the color is deep
amber, 3 to 5 ea minutes.

Immediately pour hot caramel into foil-lined pan. Using hot pads to
protect hands (mixture is very hot), tilt pan to spread caramel in
thin layer. Set aside until hard and completely cool, about 30
minutes.

When cool, lift foil from pan; peel foil from caramel. Break caramel
into chunks.  To make powder, whirl chunks in a blender or food
processor fitted with metal blade (container must be completely dry).
If you use a blender, you may need to make powder in several batches.
Use, or store airtight at room temperature for up to 1 month.

Makes about 1 3/4 cups.
