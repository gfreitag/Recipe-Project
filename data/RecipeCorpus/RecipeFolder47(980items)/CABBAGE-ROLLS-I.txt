* Vegetarian use vegetable stock rather than chicken stock. 1. To make
sauce: In a 2 quart saucepan over medium-low heat, saute' the celery
and onions in the stock for about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes,
basil, vinegar and oregano.  Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Set
aside while you make the rolls. 2. To make the cabbage rolls: In a
small saucepan over low heat, saute' the onions, mushrooms and garlic
in the stock for 3 to 5 minutes.  Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in
the rice or barley, tomatoes, bread crumbs, soy sauce, parsley, curry
and pepper. 3. Blanch the cabbage leaves in boiling water for about 3
minutes, or until pliable. Drain. Place about 1/2 cup of mixture on
each leaf. Roll the leaf tightly to enclose the filling. 4. Coat a
9x9 baking dish with no-stick spray. Add the rolls, seam side down.
Spread 1 cup of the tomato sauce over the rolls.
Cover with foil and bake at 400 F for 25 to 35 minutes. Serve the
heated cabbage rolls with the remaining sauce.
