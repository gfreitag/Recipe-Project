-CAPITOL LUNCH CHILI SAUCE
1 lb. hamburger 4 green peppers (chopped) 4 onions (chopped) 3 celery
stalks (chopped) 3 pcs. chopped garlic

Mix hamburger and chopped ingredients in a saucepan. Add app. 3 cups
of water.  Cook slowly until mixture begins to thicken.

When  it thickens, add 3 tablespoons of chili powder, then add salt
and pepper to suit your taste.

The  secret of this sauce is that you must cook it S-L-O-W-L-Y (3-4
hrs.), stirring often.

When  finished cooking, add 3 tablespoons of dried mustard and stir in
well.   For best results, use hot dogs with the "skin" on them
(Capitol Lunches  the Martin Rosol's brand). Put the hot dog on a
FRESH roll, spread on some fresh mustard,  fresh  chopped onion,
spread on the sauce, and ENJOY!

(Note:  This recipe makes a LOT of sauce, as you can imagine, since
the quantities are for use in a restaurant. Use smaller amounts of all
ingredients to suit your needs.) Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40
