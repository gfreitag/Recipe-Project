Title: BUTTERMILK-APRICOT SCONES
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
2 c  Flour
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
MMMMM---------------------MOIST INGREDIENTS--------------------------
1/4 c  Margarine or butter, chilled
-and cut into small pieces
1/3 c  Chopped dried apricots
1/4 c  Buttermilk or yogurt
1/4 c  Apricot nectar
1    Egg, lightly beaten
Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl; cut in margarine with a pastry
blender (or two forks) until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add
the apricots and toss well, making sure each piece is well coated in
flour and not clumped up with other apricot pieces. Make a well in
the center of the mixture.  Combine buttermilk, apricot nectar, and
egg; add to the well and mix with dry ingredients, until dry
ingredients are moistened (dough will be sticky).

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, flour you hands, and
kneaded 4-5 times or knead it while still in the bowl (not
traditional, but it seems to work for me). Pat dough into a 9" circle
on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray.  Cut dough into 8
wedges. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes, or until golden.

Serve warm.

Each scone will be around 230 calories (30% from fat) more or less,
depending on the fat content of the buttermilk. I find yogurt works
as well as buttermilk in the recipe. You could also brush the top of
the scones with a little beaten egg white and sprinkle with sugar
before backing, for a little extra sweetness.
