Title: CALZONE (FILLED TURNOVERS)
Categories: Italian, Pizza, Main dish
Yield: 4 -6 serving
Basic pizza dough
2 c  (about 8 oz) shredded fresh
Mozzarella cheese
2 c  (about 1 lb) ricotta cheese
1/2 c  (about 2 oz) freshly grated
Parmesan cheese
Cornmeal, if using a pizza
Peel
1/2 c  Olive oil, approximately
1 c  Peeled, seeded, chopped, and
Well-drained vine-ripened or
Canned Italian plum tomatoes
5 oz Prosciutto or other
Flavourful ham, slivered
3    Garlic cloves, minced or
Pressed (optional)
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
In a large bowl, combine the mozzarella, ricotta, and 1/4 cup of the
Parmesan; reserve. Roll out or stretch the pizza dough into circles.
Working with 1 circle at a time, place the dough on a pizza pan
generously sprinkled with cornmeal or on a lightly oiled pizza
screen. Brush dough all over with olive oil, then cover half of dough
circle with a generous portion of the cheeses, leaving a 1/2-inch
border around the edges. Sprinkle with the tomatoes, prosciutto,
garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Fold the uncovered side over
the filling and press the edges of the dough together to seal.  Brush
the dough with olive oil. Transfer to an oven preheated to 500
degrees and bake until the crust is golden brown and puffy, about 15
minutes.  Remove from the oven to a plate, lightly brush with olive
oil, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and serve immediately. Serves 4
to 6 as a main course, 8 to 10 as a starter.
