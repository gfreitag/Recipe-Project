Title: CANDIED GRAPEFRUIT PEEL

2 md Grapefruit (or 3), peels of
Water
3 c  Sugar
Food coloring
DIRECTIONS: Cover peel with cold water. Bring to boil and cook until
tender, pouring off water and adding fresh cold water several times.
Drain. With spoon, remove white inner portion of peel. With knife or
tiny star cookie cutter, cut a few stars from peel, if desired. With
scissors or sharp knife, cut rest of peel in thin strips. Make syrup
by boiling 2 cups sugar with 1 cup water. Add a little red or green
food coloring. (A drop or two of yellow coloring with red improves
the finished color.) Add peel; cook over low heat until peel has a
clear, candied appearance. Remove peel, 2 or 3 pieces at a time,
allowing excess syrup to drain back into saucepan. Roll strips
separately into remaining 1 cup sugar until well coated. Place on
rack to cool. Store in tightly covered container in cool, dry place.
Keeps at least a month.
