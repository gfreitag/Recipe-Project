Categories: Cajun, Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
2    Whole bay leaves
1 ts Salt
1 ts Ground cayenne pepper
1 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts White pepper
1/2 ts Ground cumin
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
MMMMM----------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS---------------------------
4 tb Unsalted butter
3/4 c  Finely chopped onions
1/2 c  Green bell peppers, chopped
1/4 c  Green onions, finely chopped
2 ts Minced garlic
1 tb Tabasco sauce
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/2 c  Evaporated milk
1/2 c  Catsup
1 1/2 lb Ground beef
1/2 lb Ground pork
2    Eggs, lightly beaten
1 c  Very fine bread crumbs
Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
Melt the butter in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the
onions, celery, bell peppers, green onions, garlic, tabasco,
Worcestershire and seasoning mix. Saute until mixture starts sticking
excessively, about 6 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping the
pan bottom well. Stir in the milk and catsup. Continue cooking for
about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and allow
mixture to cool to room temperature. Place the ground beef and pork
in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan. Add the eggs, the cooked
vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs, remove the bay leaves. Mix by
hand until thoroughly combined. In the center of the pan, shape the
mixture into a loaf that is about 1-1/2 inches high, 6 inches wide
and 12 inches long. Bake uncovered at 350F for 25 minutes, then raise
heat to 400F and continue cooking until done, about 35 minutes
longer. Serve immediately as is or with Very Hot Cajun Sauce for
Beef. This is best using both ground pork and ground beef, as the
pork gives more flavor diversity. However, you can make it with
ground beef only. From Paul Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen" Submitted
