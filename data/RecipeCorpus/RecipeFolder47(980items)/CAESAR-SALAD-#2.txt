Make dressing by whisking together vinegar, anchovy, if desired,
mustard, minced garlic and pepper. Slowly whisk in 1 cup olive oil,
drop by drop at first. When all the oil has been added, whisk in
lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce.  If you omit the anchovy,
season with salt, if desired.
To prepare croutons, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and vegetable
oil in skillet.  Saute sliced garlic until lightly browned, about 3
minutes. Remove with slotted spoon. Add bread to oil and cook over
medium heat, stirring and flipping pieces often, until golden on all
sides. Remove croutons and drain on several layers of paper towels.
To make salad, remove and discard outer green leaves of romaine.
(The best Caesar is made with the inner light green and white parts
of the lettuce.) Tear leaves into 2-inch pieces; rinse and thoroughly
dry lettuce. Count on about 2 cups of torn leaves per person.
To assemble salad, place torn romaine in a large bowl. Sprinkle
with 1/4 cup cheese.  Add croutons and toss well. Add remaining 1/4
cup cheese and toss again. Add dressing, toss well; serve at once.
