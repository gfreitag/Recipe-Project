Cook noodles according to package directions and set aside. In a large
skillet, saute mushrooms, green and red peppers, and green onions in 2
tablespoons of butter. Cook for 5 minutes, add garlic and stir. Remove
vegetables from pan and set aside.  In the same pan, melt the
remaining butter over medium heat, blend in flour, then gradually
pour in milk. Stir until smooth and thickened. Blend in seasoning
salt, wine, white pepper, and 1 cup of the shredded cheese. Cook and
stir until cheese melts. To the sauce, add the noodles and
vegetables. Pour all into a 1-1/2-quart casserole and top with
remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes
until bubbly.

Note:  This sauce can be made ahead of time, covered, and
refrigerated. Let stand for 20 minutes or so at room temperature
before baking. You might need a little more butter, I had to use more
than stated in the ingredients; you may get by with the amount listed.
