MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar

1/4 c  Chocolate chips

Sift together sugar, flour and salt.  Work the wine in gradually,
kneading to a soft dough.  Roll out on a floured surface to 1/8-inch
thickness, and cut out five-inch discs. Wrap each disc around a
cannoli form, sealing the edge with egg white.

Heat oil, five inches deep, in a small, deep saucepan, and fry one at
a time until golden and crisp.  Remove with tongs, let oil run off,
and drain on a paper towel. Let the pastry cool slightly, then slip
it carefully off the form.

Note:  Shells will keep for a week or two in a sealed container, so
they can be made ahead.

Filling:  In a mixing bowl, beat the ricotta with an electric mixter.
Add remaining filling ingredients. Stuff shells just before serving.
Sprinkle with powdered sugar.
