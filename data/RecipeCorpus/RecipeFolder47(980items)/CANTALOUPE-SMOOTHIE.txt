If on a hurried morning you eat nothing but this smoothie, you will
still be doing your body a favor. The drink packs a powerful punch of
potassium, calcium, vitamin C and beta carotene.

Place unpeeled banana in the freezer overnight or for up to 3 months.
Remove banana from the freezer snd let it sit for 2 minutes, or until
the skin begins to soften. With a paring knife, remove the skin.
(Don't worry if a little fiber remains.) Cut the banana into chunks
and put in a blender or food processor. Seed the cantelope quarter
and cut the flesh from the rind. Cut the flesh into chunks and add to
the blender. Add the remaining ingredients and blend until smooth.
