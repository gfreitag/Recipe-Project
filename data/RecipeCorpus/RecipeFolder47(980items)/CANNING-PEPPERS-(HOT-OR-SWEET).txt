Title: CANNING PEPPERS (HOT OR SWEET)
Categories: Vegetables, Canning
Yield: 1 Recipe  Hot or sweet, including chiles, jalapeno, and pimnto

Quantity: An average of 9 pounds is needed per canner load of 9
pints. A bushel weighs 25 pounds and yields 20 to 30 pints--an
average of 1 pound per pint.

Quality: Select firm yellow, green, or red peppers. Do not use soft or
diseased peppers.

Procedure: Select your favorite pepper(s). Caution: If you choose hot
peppers, wear plastic gloves while handling them or wash hands
thoroughly with soap and water before touching your face. Small
peppers may be left whole. Large peppers may be quartered. Remove
cores and seeds. Slash two or four slits in each pepper, and either
blanch in boiling water or blister using one of the following methods:

Oven or broiler method: Place peppers in a hot oven (400 degrees F) or
broiler for 6-8 minutes until skins blister.

Range-top method: Cover hot burner, either gas or electric, with
heavy wire mesh. Place peppers on burner for several minutes until
skins blister.

Allow peppers to cool. Place in a pan and cover with a damp cloth.
This will make peeling the peppers easier. After several minutes,
peel each pepper. Flatten whole peppers. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to
each pint jar, if desired. Fill jars loosely with peppers and add
fresh boiled water, leaving 1-inch headspace.

Adjust lids and process following the recommendations in Table 1 or
Table 2 according to the method of canning used.
