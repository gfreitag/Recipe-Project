Combine soup and water in your bread machine's pan and let sit 15
minutes. Add the remaining ingredients in the order listed. Fire it
up on the "BREAD" setting. Let it cool completely, preferably
overnight to develop the onion flavor.  Toasting will also sharpen
the onion flavor.

To suit your own taste, you can vary the flour in any combination
equaling 3 cups.  Remember that 100% whole wheat will make a shorter
loaf.
