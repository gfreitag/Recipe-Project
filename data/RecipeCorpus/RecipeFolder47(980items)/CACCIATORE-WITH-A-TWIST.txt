Title: CACCIATORE WITH A TWIST
Categories: Italian, Pasta
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Uncooked Rotini (Spiral
Pasta) -- I had multicolored
2 ts Olive Oil
1 md Onion -- sliced
1 sm Green Bell Pepper, Seeded --
Cut into strips
2    Garlic Cloves -- minced
1/2 lb Turkey Breast -- cut into
Strips
15 oz Can Garbanzo Beans
15 oz Can Tomato Sauce
3/4 tb Dried Oregano Leaves
Cook rotini to desired doneness as directed on package. Drain; keep
warm.

Meanwhile, heat oil in large non-stick skillet over medium hear until
hot. Add onion, bell pepper, garlic, and turkey; cook and stir 5 to
10 minutes or until turkey is no longer pink. ( I cooked the onion
for awhile first, added the meat and pepper and then finally in the
last few minutes added the garlic...I don't like over done garlic).

Add tomato sauce, beans and oregano; mix well.  Bring to boil. Reduce
heat; cover and simer 10 minutes or until thoroughly heated.

Serve over rotini.

Bonus idea.... Instead of rotini use radiatore (pasta nuggets) and
cannellini beans.. with another type meat if wanted. This is another
recipe in the same issue. They suggest to serve with parmesan cheese
