Title: CANNING FRUIT-BASED BABY FOODS
Categories: Canning, Information
Yield: 1 Guide  You may prepare any chunk-style or pureed fruit with or without sugar,
using the procedure for preparing each fruit. Pack in half-pint,
preferably, or pint jars and refer to the processing times in Table 1.

Caution: Do not attempt to can vegetables, red meats, or poultry
meats, because proper processing times for pureed foods have not been
determined for home use. Instead, can and store these foods using the
standard processing procedures; puree or blend them at serving time.
Heat the blended foods to boiling, simmer for 10 minutes, cool, and
serve. Store unused portions in the refrigerator and use within 2
days for best quality.
