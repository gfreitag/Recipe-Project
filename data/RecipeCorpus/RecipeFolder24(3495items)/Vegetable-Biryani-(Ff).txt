Parboil good rice (not the supermarket junk rice, get a nice basmati
~- most indians seem to favor elephant brand). water sautee your
favorite veges, but dont make them soft. add roasted cumin, very
little turmeric, cayenne pepper and garam masala (i usually mixes the
spices and dry roated together before adding to veges). in a large
pan with a lid layer rice/vege/rice (and repeat as needed). Stick a
in few potatoes, a few sticks of cinnamon, a few black cardamoms, and
many cloves of garlic, and some curry leaves. On top pour in saffron
dissolved in skim milk. Add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup water. Secure and
seal the lid (i seal by sticking dough right around the lid). bake in
oven at medium (350 or so) for about an hour (just when you are ready
to eat take it out). Its great and FF!! (i like to bake it enough to
get some burnt rice at the bottom of the pan. you may want to spray
the pan lightly with PAM to make it easier to get the burnt rice out)
