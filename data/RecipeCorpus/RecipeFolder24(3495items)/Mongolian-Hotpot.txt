Slice lamb very thinly and arrange on two large plates.  Put stock
into a large saucepan with ginger and garlic and simmer for 15
minutes.  Put scallions, coriander, spinach, bok choy and noodles
into separate serving bowls. Combine the ingredients for dipping
sauce and divide between six small dishes. Put stock into a special
Mongolian hotpot or a fondue pot. Add scallions and bring back to the
boil. Transfer pot to burner. Each person uses fondue forks or
Chinese wire strainers to cook pieces of food in stock. The food is
then dipped in sauce before eating. Any remaining spinach and bok
choy are finally added to the pot with coriander and noodles. When
noodles are tender, the soup is served in bowls. From:
