Title: Crispy Oatmeal Cookies
Categories: Diabetic, Cake/cookie
Yield: 36 cookies
1 c  Quick rolled oats
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/3 c  Butter (margarine)
1/3 c  Lightly packed brown sugar
1/4 c  Warm water
1 c  Flour, divided 1/4 cup aside
My note:  these keep fairly well in a covered container, and freeze
well according to the cookbook.  Try ginger (used in some Australian
ANZAC cookies) instead of cinnamon.

Cream butter and sugar together thoroughly, then beat in water.  Set
aside 1/4 cup flour for rolling.  Mix together the remaining dry
ingredients, then stir them into the creamed mixture.

Add the remaining flour gradually to the dough until it is stiff
enough to roll.  Divide the dough into 3 lumps about the same size.
Roll each lump of dough out about 1/8 inch thick and cut into 12
pieces about the same size. This is much easier than trying to use a
cookie cutter if you need to know cookies per serving.

Place on a lightly greased cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 F about 10
minutes or until golden brown around the edges.  Remove from pan,
cool. Store in a covered container.  Makes about 36 cookies.
