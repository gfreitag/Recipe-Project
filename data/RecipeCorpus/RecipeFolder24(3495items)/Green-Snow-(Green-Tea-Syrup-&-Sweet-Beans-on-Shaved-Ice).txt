[Author's note]: "I had this dish for the first time at the Kitcho
restaurant on the outskirts of Kyoto.  I was entranced by it.  It was
so light -- a perfect way to finish off a summer meal.  It consisted
of a mound of shaved ice, overflowing with a green tea syrup and
topped with sweet azuki beans.  You may use one of two different
types of powdered green tea for this dish. There is an instant green
tea which is cheaper, and then there is the more expensive "matcha",
a fine powdered tea used in the elegant Japanese tea ceremony."

DIRECTIONS: Put the beans and 3 cups water in a small pot.  Bring to a
boil.  Cover, turn heat to low and cook for 2 minutes.  Turn off the
flame. Let the pot sit, covered, for 1 hour.  Bring to a boil again.
Cover, turn heat to low and simmer 30 minutes.  Add the 5 tablespoons
sugar and simmer vigorously, uncovered, for another 10 to 12 minutes.
Cool the beans in their liquid and then drain.

Combine the 1/2 cup sugar with 1/2 cup water in a small pot and bring
to a boil. Turn heat to VERY low and simmer 3 to 4 minutes.  Cool.
Mix in the tea. (Taste as you go; add more or less tea, as you like.)

Pile a cup of shaved ice in the center of each of four ice-cream
bowls. Divide syrup over the ice. Divide beans into four portions and
scatter them over the top.
