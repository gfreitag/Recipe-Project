Title: Smen (Cooked and Salted Butter)
Categories: Condiment, Moroccan
Yield: 1 batch
1 tb Kosher or pickling salt
1 lb Sweet butter, cut up
In 2-quart saucepan, melt the butter over moderate heat, stirring
frequently to avoid coloring it.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat and
simmer, undisturbed, for 45 minutes, or until the butter is clear and
the solids on the bottom are light brown.

Spoon the clear liquid into a cheesecloth-lined strainer (lined w/4
layers of cheesecloth over a bowl), and to keep the smen from turning
rancid repeat the straining; the smen must be absolutely clear.
Discard the milk solids in the saucepan.

Stir in the salt, then pour the liquid butter into a sterile, airtight
1-pint glass jar, cover, and store in a cool place or in the
refrigerator.

Note:  This will keep a long time, six months or longer.

Yield:  About 1 cup.

Wolfert notes that, while this basic smen cannot be compared with the
taste of the herbed smens produced by the Fassis, this recipe tastes
nutty because of the cooking of the butter, and she also says that
this recipe is more practical than herbal smen because it will keep
much longer.
