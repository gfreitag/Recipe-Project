quail eggs: allow 4 to 6 quail eggs per person mayonnaise: 8 egg
yolks 1 tablespoon French mustard 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 litre olive oil juice of 2 lemons a little boiling water

To prepare eggs: put eggs in a large saucepan and slowly bring to the
boil. Simmer for 5 minutes.  Drain and stand under cold running water
to cool. Drain well.

To make mayonnaise: put egg yolks in small bowl and beat well. Add
mustard and seasonings and 1/2 teaspoon of oil.  Beat again.  Still
beating, add oil, drop by drop, until the mayonnaise becomes thick
and creamy. Then add oil 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well between
each addition. Add lemon juice and pour in 1 tablespoon of boiling
water, continuing to beat well. Adjust seasonings.  Store in airtight
container in refrigerator. Serve eggs in their shells. Each guest
removes the shells and dips eggs in mayonnaise to eat. Jocelyn Van
