Title: Marguarita Chicken
Categories: Main dish, Poultry
Yield: 2 servings
1 1/2 oz Tequila
1 tb Minced lime zest
1 1/2 tb Crushed garlic, or to taste
Salt to taste
1 1/2 lb Chicken breasts, boneless
-and skinless
3 oz Frzn limeade concentrate,
-defrosted
Cut the chicken into 1/2"x1 1/2" strips. Combine all ingredients in a
large mixing bowl. If you have the time, refrigerate this so the
chicken can marinate, preferably overnight. If you do not have the
time, go straight to the cooking phase; however, the taste will not
be as strong.

Preheat oven to 400xF. Pour the chicken and marinade into a shallow
pan and bake for 30-40 minutes, tossing the chicken every 10 minutes.
Cook until golden brown. Serve hot, with Spanish rice.
