Crust: Grind gingersnaps and sugar in a food processor to fine
crumbs. With machine running, slowly add butter.  Press mixture into
bottom of a 9 or 10" spring-form pan.  Freeze for 15 minutes (can be
prepared up to 3 days ahead).

Filling: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 F.  Blend
all filling ingredients in food processor until smooth, stopping once
to scrape down sides of work bowl.  Pour filling into crust-lined
pan. Bake until edges of cake begin to pull away from sides of pan
and cake begins to brown (about 45 minutes); center will *not* be
firm.

Topping: Whisk together all ingredients. Without removing cake from
oven, pour topping evenly over hot cake, starting at the edges.
Spread evenly with a spoon or spatula.  Continue baking until edges
begin to bubble (about 10 minutes).  Cool on rack and refrigerate at
least 12 hours. (Can be prepared up to 2 days ahead).  Run a sharp
knife around edge of pan before removing the form.  Press hazelnuts
around top edge of cake for garnish.

Serves 10 (more or less).
