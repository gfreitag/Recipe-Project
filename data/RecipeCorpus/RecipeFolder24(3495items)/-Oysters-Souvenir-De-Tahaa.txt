Oysters and Breading: =====================

Beat the eggs in a bowl and set aside.  Add fresh herbs to the
bread crumbs and set aside.  Shuck oysters and save juice and shells.
Place the oysters on a dry towel.  Sprinkle well with flour.  Dip
oysters into egg mixture and then into crumb/herb mixture.  Place
oysters on a dry towel and put them in the refrigerator.

Cream of Shallots Sauce: ========================

In a saucepan, cook the shallots, white wine, oyster juice and
lemon juice until all of the liquid has evaporated.  Add the cream
and bring to a strong boil, whisking constantly.  Whip in the small
pieces of butter until melted.  Remove from heat.  Season to taste
with salt and pepper. Strain through fine sieve into another pan and
keep warm.

Assembly: =========

In a large saute pan, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1
tablespoon of butter.  Heat until the butter sizzles.

Add the oysters and cook for 1 minute on each side until light
brown and crispy on the outside.

Remove and place the oysters on paper towels to soak up some of
the fats.

Warm serving plates.  Pour some of the sauce onto the plates and
place an oyster shell in the center of the plate with a garnish of
parsley and half a lime.

Arrange the oysters in circular pattern around the garnish.
Serve immediately.
