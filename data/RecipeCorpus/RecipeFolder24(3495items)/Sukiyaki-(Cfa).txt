Cook this mixture of meat and vegetables at the table in a chafing
dish or on a small burner.

Arrange beef, long rice, bamboo shoots, onions, mushrooms, onion
tops, and soybean cake attractively on a large platter, keeping each
item separate.  In the container to be used for cooking, heat suet
and saute meat until golden brown.  Stir in rice, bamboo shoots,
onions, and mushrooms.  Cook 10 minutes.  Then add sugar, sherry, soy
sauce, and MSG and mix well.  Add green onion tops and soybean cake,
if desired, just before serving.  Since sukiyaki should be served
hot, begin cooking second portion after serving first.

EGG: Serve one raw egg in each small individual bowl.  Let each
guest beat egg slightly with chopsticks.  Dip each biteful of hot
sukiyaki into egg.

RICE:  Cook 1 1/2 cups white rice.  Serve in a large bowl, letting
each guest dip rice into individual dishes.
