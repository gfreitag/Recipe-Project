Clean the squid and peel the shrimp.  Clean and scale the fish, but
leave the heads and tails on.  Cut into good-sized chunks.  Cut the
onion in half, and then slice each half in the thinnest possible
slivers. Add them to the garlic and olive oil in a big, heavy soup
pot, and saute over medium heat.  When the garlic is golden discard
it. When the onion slivers are translucent, add the cut-up squid, and
cook and stir until their color changes.  Add the vinegar, and when
that has evaporated, add the tomatoes (mashing them in the pot), fish
chunks, clams, shrimp, salt and 2 or 3 twists of the peppermill. Add
enough water just barely to cover fish. Bring to a boil, reduce the
heat, and cook for about 20 minutes, or until the clams are opened
and the meatiest fish is cooked. Taste for salt, and adjust if
necessary. Sprinkle in the parsley, and cook another 1 or 2 minutes.
Serve with slices of crusty, hot Italian bread. When serving the
soup, try to give a goodly variety of fish chunks, shrimp and clams
to each plate first, and then ladle out about a cup of broth per
plate. From The Romagnolis' Table by Margaret & G. Franco Romagnoli.
