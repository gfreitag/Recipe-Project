Categories: Bread, Diabetic, Fruit, Muffin
Yield: 10 lg muffins
MMMMM----------------------------NUTS---------------------------------
1 c  Walnuts
MMMMM----------------------WET INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1/3 c  Water or 2 eggs
1/2 c  Fruit sweetener
3/4 t  Vanilla extract
1 2/3 c  Mashed bananas
2/3 c  Unsweetened applesauce
3 T  Apple butter
1/2 c  Oil
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
3/4 t  Salt
1 1/2 t  Cinnamon
1/4 t  Nutmeg
3 1/2 c  Brown rice flour
1 3/4 t  Baking soda
1 3/4 t  Baking powder
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly spray a regular size muffin
tin with lecithin spray. Toast the walnuts in the oven for 7-10
minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool, then coarsely
chop them with a knife or with the pulsing action in a food
processor. Whisk the wet ingredients together in the order listed
until well blended. Sift together the dry ingredients into a large
bowl. Make a well in the center, and stir in the wet mix. When half
mixed, stir in the toasted walnuts. Be careful not to over mix, the
batter should remain lumpy. Using a rounded #12 scoop (1/2 cup) place
the batter into the prepared muffin tin. Bake the muffins on the
middle shelf of the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, turning the
muffin tin once if necessary to allow for even browning. Let the
muffins cool in the pan for 5 minutes before removing them to a wire
rack to cool completely.
