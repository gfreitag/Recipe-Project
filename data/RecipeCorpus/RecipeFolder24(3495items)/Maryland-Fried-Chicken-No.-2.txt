Title: Maryland Fried Chicken No. 2
Categories: Chicken, Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Flour
1/4 t  Pepper
1    Butter
1    Fryer
1/2 t  Salt
1    Lard
1 c  Milk
Cut up chicken into serving pieces. Sift flour and mix with salt and
pepper. Dredge chicken pieces well on both sides with seasoned flour.
Have about 1/2 inch of hot fat in a large frying pan. Put chicken in
and cover pan for five to seven minutes. Uncover and turn chicken
with underside is a rich, golden brown. Cover again for the same
length of time, then remove top and finish browning chicken. Reduce
heat, remove excess fat from pan, add a very little water, cover
again and steam until tender, juicy, and done through to the bone.
This will take about ten to 20 minutes longer, depending on the size
of the pieces. Take chicken out and arrange on a hot serving platter.
To make cream gravy, pour off most of the fat, leaving the brown
crumbs. Put a small lump of butter in the pan and scrape up all the
crusty brown bits. Add a little seasoned flour and blend until
smooth. Pour in gradually a cup of rich milk and stir until creamy
and thickened. Test seasoning. Strain through a coarse sieve, if
necessary. Gravy may be served over chicken or in a sauce boat. Fried
mush is a nice accompaniment, surrounding chicken on the platter.
