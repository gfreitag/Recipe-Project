MMMMM---------------------PICKLING SOLUTION--------------------------
3 ts Cloves, whole
3    Bay leaf
1 1/2 c  Sugar
7 1/2 c  White wine vinegar
3 ts Allspice, ground
Scald onions for 2 minutes in boiling water. Drain and place in cold
water and peel. In a large bowl, stir half of the salt into half of
the water until the salt has dissolved. Add the onions. Cover the
bowl and leave the onions to soak for 12 hours.

Drain the onions, discard the brine and wash and dry the bowl.
Dissolve the remaining salt in the remaining water and pour it over.
Cover bowl and leave for a further 36 hours.

Drain onions and pack them into clean, dry preserving jars. Set aside.

In a medium sized pan, dissolve the sugar in the vinegar over low
heat, stirring constantly.  When the sugar has dissolved, add the
allspice, cloves and bay leaf and bring the vinegar to a boil. Boil
mixture for 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat.  Cover the pan
and set aside to cool.  When vinegar is cool, pour it over the onions
to cover them completely. Seal the jars and store them in a cool, dry
place.
