MMMMM----------------------FRUIT AND SEEDS---------------------------
4 t  Caraway seeds
3/4 c  Raisins
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1 1/2 t  Baking powder
3/4 t  Salt
5 c  Unbleached white flour

1 c  Unsweetened applesauce
2    Eggs
3/4 c  Cold butter

1 1/3 c  Buttermilk
Begin by plumping the raisins. Bring 1 cup water to a boil, add the
raisins, when the water returns to a boil, turn the heat off. Let the
raisins plump for at least 10 minutes. Drain the raisins, saving the
raisin water for another use. Set the raisins aside. Preheat the oven
to 350 degrees, lightly spray a regular size muffin tin with lecithin
spray. Cut the cold butter into 1/2 inch pieces, sift the dry
ingredients together into a medium size mixing bowl or the mixing
bowl of an electric mixer. With the mixer on its lowest spead use the
paddle attachment or your beaters to cut the cold butter into the dry
ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Stir in the
plumped raisins and the caraway seeds. In a small bowl, whisk the
sweetener, buttermilk, applesauce, and eggs, and add to the flour
mixture. Stir together on medium low speed just until mixed. Use a
rounded #12 scoop (1/2 cup) to place the batter into the prepared
muffin tins. Bake the muffins on the middle shelf othe preheated oven
for 30-35 minutes. Turn muffin tins once if necessary for the muffins
to brown evenly. Let the muffins cool in the pan for 5 minutes before
removing them to a wire rack to cool completely. Submitted By JANE
