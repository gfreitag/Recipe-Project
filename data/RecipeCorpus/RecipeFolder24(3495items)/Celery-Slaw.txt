Title: Celery Slaw
Categories: Diabetic, Vegetable, Side dish
Yield: 6 sweet ones
2 tb Sugar(used sugar substitute)
1/2 ts Salt;
2 tb Vinegar;
1/2 c  Walnuts; coarsely chopped
-(optional)
3 c  Celery; thinly sliced
1/2 c  Carrots; grated
1    Apple; unpeeled, cored, and
-diced
1/2 c  Mayonnaise;(low-cal)
Combine celery, carrots, and apples.  Thoroughly blend remaining
ingredients and fold into celery mixture.  If desired, fold in
walnuts or sprinkle over top as a gamish.  Chill at least 30 minutes
before serving in lettuce-lined bowl.  Delightly crunchy! Food
Exchange per serving: 1 FAT EXCHANGE + 1/4 FRUIT EXCHANGE (IF YOU
USED THE BIGGEST APPLE EVER). I would cut this recipe down to make
this be 1 fat exchange for me and use sugar substitute. Could be used
as a side dish for the vegetarian.
