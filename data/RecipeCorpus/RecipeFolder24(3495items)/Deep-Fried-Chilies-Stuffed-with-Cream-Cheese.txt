Title: Deep-Fried Chilies Stuffed with Cream Cheese
Categories: Tex/mexican, Appetizer, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 12 chilies
3 oz Cream cheese
1/3 c  All-purpose flour
1    Egg; lightly beaten
1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
Cheese
Red picante salsa or
Red molcajete salsa
2 c  Corn oil or other vegetable
Oil
12    Fresh jalapeno or yellow
Wax chili peppers
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Distilled white vinegar
1/2 ts Salt
The day before serving, place the oil in a small frying pan over high
heat and heat until very hot. Add the chilies, a few at a time, and
fry until well-blistered, about 3 seconds on each side.  Using a
slotted spoon transfer the chilies to a large bowl filled with cold
water. Remove the pan from the heat and let the oil cool, then
reserve in a covered container for cooking the stuffed chilies the
next day. With the chilies still in the water, peel off the skins
with your fingers, or use a knife if necessary. Then make a
lengthwise slit in each one and remove the seeds and ribs; leave stem
intact. Discard the water.

In a bowl stir together the 1 cup water, vinegar and salt. Add the
chilies, cover and let soak at room temperature for 24 hours to
reduce the piquancy.

Drain the chilies, rinse under cold water and drain again; pat dry.
Carefully stuff each chili with an equal amount of the cream cheese.
Place the flour, egg and Parmesan cheese in separate shallow bowls.
Dip the stuffed chilies, one at a time, first in the flour, than in
the beaten egg and finally in the cheese, coating completely each
time.

Pour the reserved oil into a small frying pan over medium heat. When
the oil is hot, add the chilies, a few at a time, and fry until
lightly golden, about 2 minutes on each side. Using a slotted spoon,
transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve warm with salsa on the side.
