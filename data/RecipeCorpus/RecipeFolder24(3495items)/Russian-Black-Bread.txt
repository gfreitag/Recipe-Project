Title: Russian Black Bread
Categories: Ussr, Bread
Yield: 2 loaves
2 pk Dry active yeast
2 1/2 c  Water
1/4 c  Vinegar
1/4 c  Dark molasses
1 oz Unsweetened chocolate
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
-(1/2 stick)
1 ts Cornstarch
1/2 c  Cold water
4 c  Rye flour
3 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Granulated sugar
2 ts Salt
2 c  100 percent bran cereal
2 tb Caraway seed, crushed
2 ts Instant coffee granules
2 ts Onion powder
1/2 ts Fennel seed, crushed
Combine rye and all-purpose flour, set aside. In large bowl
thoroughly mix 2 1/3 cups flour mixture, sugar, salt, cereal, caraway
seed, instant coffee granules, onion powder, fennel seed and yeast.

Combine water, vinegar, molasses, chocolate and butter in
saucepan. Warm over low heat. Gradually add to dry ingredients. Beat
at medium speed with electric mixer for 2 minutes, scraping bowl
occasionally.

Add 1/2 cup flour mixture. Beat at high speed 2 minutes, scraping
bowl occasionally. Stir in enough additional flour mixture to make
soft dough.

Turn out on lightly floured board. Cover dough with bowl. Let
rest 15 minutes. Then knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 to 15
minutes. (Dough will be sticky.) Place in greased bowl, turning to
grease top. Cover and let rise in warm place, free from drafts, until
doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Divide dough in half, form into 2 loaves and place in 9-by-5-
inch loaf pans. Or form into 2 round balls and place on greased
baking sheet.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until bread
sounds hollow when tapped on the top.

Meanwhile, combine cornstarch and 1/2 cup cold water. Cook over
medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Stir
constantly for 1 minute. As soon as bread is baked, brush cornstarch
mixture over tops of loaves. Return bread to oven. Bake 2 to 3
minutes or until glaze is set. Remove from pans. Cool on wire racks.
