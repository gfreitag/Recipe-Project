Put olive oil in the bottom of a large pot and add onion, garlic,
ginger and other spices as you prepare them.  Rinse lentils and add
them to the pot.  Add 2 cups of water, bring to a boil and reduce
heat. Cover and simmer 30 minutes, or until lentils are tender.

Serve over rice with baked squash.  When serving this dish with a
side of baked winter squash, begin baking the squash first:  Cut it
in half, clean out the seeds and place cut side down on a baking
sheet for 30 minutes. Turn cut side up and cook until tender, up to
30 minutes more. Meanwhile, prepare the lentils.
