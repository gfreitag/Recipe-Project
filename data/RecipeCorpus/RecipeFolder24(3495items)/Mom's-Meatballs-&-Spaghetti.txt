Categories: Burgers, Vegetable, Pasta
Yield: 12 servings
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
2 cn Tomato Paste - 6 oz cans
12 oz Water
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
Parsley
Italian seasoning
1/2 sm Onion
2 tb Olive Oil
Garlic Salt
2 cn Progresso Crushed Peeled
Italian Tomatoes with Added
Puree - 28 oz cans
2 cn Tomato Sauce - 6 oz cans
MMMMM-------------------------MEATBALLS------------------------------
1/2 ts Sweet basil
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Fine bread crumbs
1/2 c  Water
3 lb Hamburg
3    Eggs
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Italian seasoning
Sauce: Chop onion and saute in olive oil and garlic salt until
golden. Do not burn.  Add remaining ingredients and simmer 2 to 3
hours . Stir occasionally.

Add meatballs.

Meatballs: Mix all together lightly. Roll in hands into medium size
balls. Drop into sauce and simmer for 4 to 5 hours stirring
occasionally.

Hint.....3 lbs of hamburg makes a lot of meatballs, you may want to
add one more of each of the canned stuff in the sauce recipe.

Do not let the sauce burn.  I cook with a diffuser under my pan so I
do not have to watch it so carefully. They work well.

Note:  Sometimes, I also add Medium Hot Sausage (that has been cooked
till the fat is out of them and drained well) at the same time I add
the meatballs.

Enjoy
