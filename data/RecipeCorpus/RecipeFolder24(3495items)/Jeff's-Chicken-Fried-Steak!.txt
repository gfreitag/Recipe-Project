Title: Jeff's Chicken Fried Steak!
Categories: Beef, Sthrn/livng, Meat
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
Oil for cooking
1/2 lb Round steak
1 c  Flour
1 c  Milk
1    Egg
MMMMM------------------------CREAM GRAVY-----------------------------
Salt
Pepper
1 c  Milk
1 c  Water
1/4 c  Flour
Heat 1/4 inch oil in heavy frying pan to medium high.

Combine 1 cup milk with the egg, whisk to mix.  Pour into 9" round
shallow pan.

Season 1 cup flour with the garlic powder, salt and pepper. Sift
together into 9" round shallow pan.

Tenderize the round steak well, trimming off excess fat and
ligament.

Dip the meat into the egg and milk mixture, then dredge in the
seasoned flour, pressing the flour into the meat.  Repeat for a
crispier coating.

When oil is hot, place the meat into oil, adjusting temp. to allow
the meat to cook for 9-12 minutes.  This allows additional
tenderizing of the meat.

When fried steak is golden brown, remove to drain on paper towels.

CREAM GRAVY:

Pour off all but 4 tablespoons of the cooking oil from the pan.
Over medium heat, slowly stir in the 1/4 cup flour, stirring
constantly.

Combine the 1 cup milk and 1 cup water, slowly add to oil/flour mix,
stirring constantly.  Stirring with a large spatula helps.  Loosen
brown bits from bottom of pan while stirring, there's great flavor
there.

Add salt and pepper to taste, raising heat to bring to a boil.  When
bubbly, lower heat and continue to stir, simmering for 5 minutes.

It's traditional to serve the meat with mashed potatoes, covering
the meat and potatoes with the gravy.  Large yeast rolls go great
with this meal too.

Well worth the effort!

Enjoy!   Jeff Duke
