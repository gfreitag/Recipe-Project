Title: Vermicelli Alla Marinara
Categories: Italian, Pasta, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 6 servings
1 t  Salt or to taste
6 T  Grated Parmesan opt.
PASTA==
6 qt Water
6 t  Salt
1 1/4 lb Vermicelli
SAUCE==
1/4 c  Olive oil
1    Garlic clove, peeled
1    Red pepper pod, seeded
3 c  Peeled plum tomatoes
1/2 t  Oregano
1 T  Chopped fresh parsley
Heat the olive oil in a small frying pan over medium heat along with
the garlic and red pepper.  When the garlic is golden and the pepper
deep brown, remove them: they've done their flavoring job.  Cool the
pan and then add the tomatoes, crushing them slightly as you stir
them in. Add the oregano and bring the combination back to a boil,
reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook about 20 minutes, or until the
sauce has thickened. Add the parsley and salt.  Cook and drain the
pasta and put it on a serving platter.  Cover with sauce, and gently
turn the pasta over and over. Sprinkle with cheese if you wish and
serve at once. From The Romagnolis' Table by Margaret & G. Franco
