Title: Golden Potato Rolls
Categories: Diabetic, Bread, Vegetable
Yield: 1 batch
1/2 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt
8 c  To 8 1/2 C A-p flour,
-divided
2    Eggs, beaten
1 pk Active dry yeast (1/4 oz.)
1/2 c  Warm water
-(110-115 degrees F.)
1 c  Milk
3/4 c  Shortening or margarine
1 1/4 c  Leftover mashed potatoes
Dissolve yeast in water; set aside. In a saucepan, combine milk,
shortening, and potatoes; cook and stir over low heat just until
shortening is melted. Remove from the heat and place in a large bowl
with sugar, salt, 2 cups of flour and the yeast mixture. Add eggs;
mix well. Cover loosely and allow to stand for 2 hours (the dough
will be like a sponge). Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make
a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth
and elastic, about 6 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once
to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled,
about 1 hour. Punch down and divide into thirds. On a floured surface
roll each portion into a 12 inch circle. Cut each circle into 12 pie
shape wedges. Beginning at the wide end, roll up each wedge. Place
rolls, point side down, on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise
30 minutes or until nearly doubled. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 15
minutes or until golden. Yield: 3 dozen.
