Yield: 1 servings
1 t  Garlic powder
2 t  Sage

All in all, a rave review soup even from "Mr. I Hate Soup", himself. I
often cook my beans in a crock pot, but when I am in a hurry I use a
little multi cooker pot.  It was sold as a deep fryer, but for
obvious reasons I don't use it that way anymore!! :-)
