Title: Pan Fried or Sauteed Yellow Perch
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb Butter
Cornmeal
1    Lemon (opt.)
6 sm Yellow perch
7-9 " long
4 tb Bacon fat or lard
Salt and pepper
Dress, scale, and what the fish, pat dry, salt and pepper, then
dredge them in the meal or meal-flour combination.
Heat the fat until it is hot enough to cook at once, but not
burning, sputtering hot.  Lay in the fish, turn heat down to barely a
medium flame, and begin to brown the fish. Keep the fish loose from
the pan bottom with a thin metal spatula.
Taking 8-10 minutes to a side (turn heat low if it seems to fry too
fast), brown the fish slowly until crisp.  Do not overcook. When the
flesh is opaque the fish is done; one hopes it's all browned by then.
Add 4 Tbs. butter to the skillet after removing the fish and
squeeze in the juice of a lemon, stir the fat and juices to loosen
the dredgings, and pour over the browned fish.

VARIATION:  After removing the fish from the skillet, toss about 1/3
cup of chopped black walnuts.  Brown lightly with the remaining
butter and sprinkle over the fish before serving.
