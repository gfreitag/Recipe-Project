Title: Halloween Snake Hot Dogs
Categories: Sandwich, Holiday, Hot dogs, Kids
Yield: 1 servings
1    Hot dog bun
1    Hot dog
Take hot dog and make horizontal slits (that go a little more than
halfway through the hot dog) down half the length of the hot dog. For
the other half of the hot dog do the same thing but make the slits on
the opposite side.  When boiled (or microwaved) the hot dog will
twist like a snake. Serve on a hot dog bun with chili or cheese if
desired. Submitted By JEANNE GEAKE   On   10-17-94
