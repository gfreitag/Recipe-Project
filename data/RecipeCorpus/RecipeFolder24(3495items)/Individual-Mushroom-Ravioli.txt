To make pasta: put all ingredients in a food processor and process
until dough forms a mass.  Turn on to a floured board and knead a
little. Wrap in plastic wrap and set aside for 1 hour.  Put through
rollers of pasta maker on mark 6, folding dough in three as you would
to make puff pastry. Cut resulting dough in four pieces to make it
easier to manage and put through the roller until you reach number 2
on the dial. Spread the strip on a floured tea towel and repeat
process with other pieces of dough. Allow to stand until strips start
to curl at the edges. To make filling: toss baby sliced mushrooms in
butter for a few minutes with salt and pepper and a little water.
Remove from pan and reserve juices. To make sauce: toss sliced field
mushrooms in butter and salt and pepper for a few minutes, add
reserved juices and some cream and cook a little. To make the
ravioli: cut 24 large circles of pasta.  Paint edges of 12 with
beaten egg. Pile an equal amount of mushroom filling in centres and
place other circles of pasta over top.  Press well together with
fingers to seal. Bring two pans of salted water to the boil. Drop
ravioli in water and boil for 12 minutes. Drain, place on individual
heated plates, pour on hot sauce, serve at once. Bon-Appetit,
Exec.Chef. Magnus Johansson
