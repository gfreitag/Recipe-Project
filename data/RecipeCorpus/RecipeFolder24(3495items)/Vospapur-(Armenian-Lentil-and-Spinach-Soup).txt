Title: Vospapur (Armenian Lentil and Spinach Soup)
Categories: Asian, Soup/stew, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
-- rinsed and drained
20 oz Frozen spinach; thawed
29 oz Canned chopped tomatoes
-- including juice
Salt and pepper; to taste
4 tb Lemon juice
-- or more to taste
1 lg Onion; chopped
3    Garlic cloves; minced
1 ts Ground cumin
1/2 ts Ground coriander
1 ts Hot Hungarian paprika
-- or more to taste
6 c  Defatted chicken stock
1 1/2 c  Dried lentils
Heat a non-stick soup pot or Dutch oven over high heat. When the pan
is very hot, all at once add the onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, and
paprika. Let sit for 30 seconds without stirring, then add 1/4 cup of
the chicken stock. Saute over high heat, stirring, for 4 minutes.

Add another 1/4 cup of the chicken stock and scrape the bottom of the
pot. Add the lentils and spinach and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.

Add the remaining 5 1/2 cups of chicken stock and the tomatoes and
bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, season with salt and pepper,
and simmer, covered, until the lentils are tender, about 50 minutes.

Season with the lemon juice and additional salt and pepper, if
needed. Let sit for 5 minutes before serving.

Serving Ideas : Serve with a good dense hearty bread.

NOTES: (adapted from the original recipe by Curtis Jackson):
"Vospapur is the generic Armenian name for lentil soup. This version
makes a rich soup that, like most, is better the second or third day.
Don't omit the lemon juice; the soup will taste rather plain without
the edge of tartness it provides. In addition, you may wish to serve
lemons or lemon juice on the side so people can doctor their
individual servings should they so desire."
