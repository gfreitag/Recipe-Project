Title: Bacardi Rum Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert
Yield: 10 servings
4    Eggs
1/2 c  Cold water
1/2 c  Salad oil
1/2 c  Dark rum
-GLAZE:
1/4 lb Butter
1/4 c  Water
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Rum (dark is best but white
-will do)
1 c  Chopped pecans or walnuts
1 pk Yellow cake mix (18-1/2
-oz.)
-(if using cake mix
-w/pudding, use 3 eggs
-instead)
1 pk Instant vanilla pudding
-(3-3/4 oz.)
-(use chocolate pudding if
-using chocolate cake)
CAKE DIRECTIONS: Preheat oven to 325F. Grease and flour 10" tube pan
(or 12 cup bundt pan). Sprinkle nuts over bottom of pan. Mix all cake
ingredients together.  Pour batter over nuts.  Bake 1 hour.  Cool.
Invert on serving plate.  Prick top (I prick deeply, but not to
bottom of cake, using long-tined fork).  Spoon and brush glaze evenly
over top and sides. Allow cake to absorb glaze and continue until
glaze is used up. GLAZE DIRECTIONS: Melt butter in saucepan.  Stir in
water and sugar. Boil 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from
heat. Stir in rum.

This is a great recipe for Rum Cake put out by Bacardi.  You can also
use Chocolate Cake and it comes out delicious.  Especially if you add
a few tablespoons of Kahlua to the final rum glaze (10" tube pan or
12 c. Bundt). I always use Duncan Hines cake mixes as I've found them
to be very moist. From: Michelle Bass
