and boil uncovered, until barely tender to bite, 6 to 8 minutes.
Drain, rinse with cold water, drain well.  Spread out in a single
layer on a double thickness of paper towels; let stand 20 to 30
minutes. In a bowl, mix mix pasta with 2 tablespoon oil to coat. Into
a deep 3 to 4 quart pan, pour about 1 inch salad oil.  Heat to 375 on
a thermometer. Drop pasta, 1 piece at time into the oil ( don't 1
piece on top or it will stick); add 1/2 to 3/4 cup at a time. Cook,
with out stirring, until pasta is crisp and light gold, 3 to 5
minutes. Lift out with slotted spoon and set on paper towels to
drain. Repeat to cook the remaining pasta. Place pasta in large paper
or plastic bag.  Add cheese, Italian herbs, garlic powder, and salt
and cayenne to taste.  Shake well to coat pasta.  Serve or, if made
ahead, let cool and store airtight up to 5 days.  Makes about 6 to 7
cups, 12 to 14 snack servings. Source: Sunset Recipe Annual; 1989
