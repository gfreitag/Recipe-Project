1/2 ea Lemon
1 tb Oil, olive
1/2 lb Pasta, fresh
1 bn Chives
7 tb Butter
2 lg Shallots, chopped

Frog Leg Sauce: ===============

In a saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of butter.  Saute the chopped
shallots in butter until they're golden brown.

Add 1 1/2 pounds of frog legs, white wine, salt and pepper.
Cover and cook slowly for 10 minutes.

Strain the liquids from the mixture back into the saute pan.
Reserve the legs.

Replace strained stock in saute pan, add 1 cup of cream and
reduce by half.  Set aside but keep warm.

Frog Legs: ==========

Debone the frog legs.  Place the meat in a meat grinder or food
processor with the filet of sole and grind thoroughly.

Add egg, salt and pepper, and 1 cup of cream (adjust to
consistency and taste.) Process the mousseline and reserve.

Pasta: ======

Boil salted water, add olive oil and pasta.  When pasta is al
dente, strain and cool under running water.  Set aside.

Mousseline: ===========

Butter four ramekins or molds.

Put the mousseline into a pastry bag and squeeze it into the
molds, leaving a hole in the center of each mold.

Fill center with frog leg meat and top with mousseline.  Tamp
gently to remove trapped air bubbles.

Place the molds onto a pan or tray in which you've poured about
an inch of water.  On top of each mold, place a layer of buttered
parchment, (butter side down), then a layer of foil.  Bake for 15
minutes at 400 F.

To Assemble: ============

To serve, saute pasta in 3 tablespoons of butter, adjust
seasoning, then layer on serving plates.

Remove mousseline from molds and place on pasta.

Bring the sauce to a boil, and add heavy cream to adjust
consistency if necessary.  If sauce is too thick, thin with white
wine.

Add butter, lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Pour sauce over mousseline and sprinkle with chopped chives.
