roulade: a little butter 4 x 60 g eggs 2 cups flaked smoked trout
salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan
cheese filling: 1 carton sour cream, lightly beaten 4 tablespoons red
salmon eggs 6 spring onions, sliced finely

To make roulade: butter a 30 cm x 2O cm lamington tin.  Line with
greaseproof paper and butter again.  Separate eggs.  Beat yolks and
add fish, seasonings and 1 tablespoon cheese.

Beat whites and carefully fold into fish mixture.  Pour mixture into
prepared tin and cook on centre shelf of a pre-heated 200'C oven for
10 to 15 minutes until roulade has risen and is firm.  Sprinkle a
tea-towel with remaining cheese, and turn roulade on to this. Remove
greaseproof paper and roll up roulade, with help of tea-towel. Tip on
to cake cooler, and allow to cool.  When cooled, unroll roulade,
trimming edges if necessary. Spread with sour cream and salmon eggs,
sprinkle with the spring onions and freshly ground pepper. Roll up
again and transfer to serving dish. Cut in slices to serve.
