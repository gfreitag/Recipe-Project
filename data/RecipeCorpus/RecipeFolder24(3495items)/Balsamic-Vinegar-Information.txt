Title: Balsamic Vinegar Information
Categories: Salad, Dressing, Information
Yield: 1 servings
ds Sugar
Garlic cloves; crushed; as
Many as desired
3    Parts balsamic vinegar
1 1/2    Parts olive oil
ds Salt
ds Freshly ground pepper
Incorporate olive oil slowly by drizzling it in and whisking as you
go. I often inundate the dressing with lots of fresh basil or
cilantro. We haven't had any bottled dressing in this house in years.
If I haven't made salad dressing, we don't eat salad! Hope this
helps..Ed MM Format Norma Wrenn npxr56b
