Potatoes are an important ingredient in rustic Italian cooking.
Recipes run the gamut from simple roasted potatoes with rosemary to a
scalloped dish smothered in cream and flavored with porcini
mushrooms.  This vegetarian dish take its cue from the Tuscany
region, noted for its olive oil, vinegars and wines.  Serve with a
crisp salad and grilled sausages. 2 large baking potatoes 3/4 tsp
salt 2 tbsp olive oil 2 cups sliced mushroom (about 8 oz) 1/2 cup
freshly grated parmesan cheese 1 onion, sliced 2 cloves garlic,
minced 1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley 1/2 tsp dried thyme 1/4 tsp
pepper 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Peel, and cut potatoes into thin slices.  In bowl, toss potatoes
gently with 1/2 tsp of the salt and half of the oil.  In separate
bowl, toss together mushroom, half of the parmesan, the onion,
garlic, parsley, thyme, pepper and remaining salt.  In 8 cup greased
casserole dish, arrange one third of potatoes in slightly overlapping
layer.  Cover with half of the mushroom mixture, then one third of
the mozzarella.  REpeat layers. Arrange remaining potatoes over top.
Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and parmesan.  Drizzle with
remaining oil.  Bake in 400F oven for 40-45 minutes, or until tender.
