Title: Dad's Lemon Jello Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert
Yield: 1 cake
4    Eggs
3/4 c  Oil
3/4 c  Water
1 pk Yellow or lemon cake mix
-without pudding or not
-"extra moist" type stuff
-Duncan Hines was last known    1 1/2 c  10x sugar
6 tb Lemon juice
3 oz Lemon Jello
Prepare cake mix as directed, but using listed ingredients.  Bake in
13 X 9 inch pan at 350F for 30 minutes.  Mix together the 10x sugar
and lemon juice.  While the cake is still very hot from the oven,
pour over the top of the cake slowly, allowing it to sink in to the
cake. Unlike many other recipes of this type you do NOT have to poke
any holes. This was one of about 3 things my Dad would cook (the
others being steak and BBQd turkey).
