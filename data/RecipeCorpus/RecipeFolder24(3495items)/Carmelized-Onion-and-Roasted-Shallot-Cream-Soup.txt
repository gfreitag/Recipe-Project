heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onions and sugar and cook
until onions carmelize, stirring frequently to prevent any sticking,
about 50 minutes. Add whole shallots, 1/2 cup sherry and dried herbs
to onions. Cook until almost no liquid remains in pot, stirring
occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add both stocks and simmer 25 minutes.
Add cream and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.  (Can be
prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to simmer before
continuing.) Add remaining 1/4 cup sherry, fresh thyme, parsley and
Tabasco to soup. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle soup into bowls.
Garnish with sage leaves if desired and serve.
