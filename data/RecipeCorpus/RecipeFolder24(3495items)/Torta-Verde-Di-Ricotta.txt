Title: Torta Verde Di Ricotta
Categories: Italian, Pie/tart, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
8 T  Grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 c  Up to ...
1/2 c  Flour
1 t  Salt
4 T  Unsalted butter
1    Two-crust pie pastry
FILLING==
10 oz Pkg frozen spinach *OR*
10 oz Fresh spinach
1 lb Ricotta
1 lg Egg
1/2 t  Freshly grated nutmeg
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Barely cook the spinach (if using
frozen, it's done by the time the ice has melted; if using fresh,
remove the stems and boil until limp).  Drain it, pressing with a
spoon against the side of the strainer to remove all water possible.
Mince the spinach finely. Put the ricotta in a medium-sized bowl, add
the spinach, and mix well. Add the unbeaten egg, the nutmeg, 1 t salt
and stir. Fold in 4 T of the Parmesan cheese and flour.  Roll the
pastry dough out just a big bigger than a 10 1/2" pie pan, using all
the dough to get one nice, thick crust, and crimp the edge. Spread
the filling in the unbaked crust. Sprinkle the top with the rest of
the Parmesan cheese, and dot with butter. Bake about 40 minutes or
until the crust is light brown and the filling is puffed and toasty.
Cool a few minutes before eating or you'll burn your tongue. From The
