Title: No Knead Rolls
Categories: Bread
Yield: 3 servings
1/4 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Soft shortening
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Warm water
2 pk Dry yeast
4 c  Sifted flour
1    Egg
Pour water in large mixing bowl.  Add yeast.  Let stand a few
minutes; stir to dissolve.  Add half of the flour, sugar, salt,
shortening, and egg. Beat until smooth, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Add rest
of the flour. Scrape sides of the bowl.  Cover; let rise in warm
place until double in bulk, about 30 minutes.  Grease muffin pans.  I
pinch off 3 small balls of dough per muffin to make cloverleaf rolls.
Bake 10 to 15 minutes at 350 degrees. Randy Rigg
