Most rustic types of bread consist of just flour, yeast, water and
salt. I usually vary mine using a cracked wheat and also semolina
flour. It seems to give the bread character. When I was under a
Neurosurgeon, we were talking about sugars in the American diet and
he said in Iran, the bread was made with out any sugars. I don't use
a bread machine either. I bake mine on unglazeed quarry tiles and
throw ice cubes in the bottom when I put the bread in. Gives it a
nice rustic flavor and appearance. Sunday I made Pizza using 3 cups
unbleached white flour and 2 cups cracked wheat flour along with 2
pks yeast, 2 cup water and 1 tsp salt. (no fats-no sugar) Put veggies
on the top, using fresh tomatoes. It made to large rounds. Again the
only fat was the pam on the bottom and Pam on the top plus 1 Tbs.
grating cheese for both pizzas. Worked out to be about 1/2 veggie and
2 bread for 2 slices. Tasted a heck of a lot better than some of the
commercial pizzas.
