1) Place the egg yolks in a blender, food processor or deep bowl.

small
whisk.

3) If using the machine, pour the oil through the funnel in a thin,
steady
stream with the machine running. If mixing by hand, add oil a few
drops
at a time, beating well in between each addition.

4) When half the oil has been added, the rest may be added in a thin
steady stream while beating constantly with a small whisk.

5) Mix in the relish, parsley, lemon juice and tobasco. Beat the egg
whites until stiff but not dry and fold into the mayonnaise created
through step 4.

6) Broil the fish about 2 inches from the heat source for about 6-10
minutes, depending on the thickness of the filets.

7) Spread the sauce over each filet and broil for 3-5 minutes longer,
or
until the sauce puffs and browns lightly.
