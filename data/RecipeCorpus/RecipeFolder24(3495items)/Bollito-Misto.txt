Title: Bollito Misto
Categories: Italian, Beef, Chicken, Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
4 t  Salt
10    Peppercorns
1 t  Marjoram
1 t  Thyme
2    Bay leaves
1 sm Cotechino sausage
2    Eggs, whites only (opt)
1 1/2 lb Beef brisket
3 lb Chicken
1 1/2 lb Small beef tongue
4    Celery stalks with leaves
2    Carrots
2    Onions
1/4 md Turnip
4    Plum tomatoes
Put the beef pieces into a big pot, at least 8 quarts. Add the 5
vegetables and enough cold water to cover everything.  Add the salt
and peppercorns. Put the pot on a high heat, bring to a boil, and
scoop off any froth that forms.  Add the herbs, reduce the heat, and
simmer for 1 hour. Add the chicken.  Prick the skin of the cotechino
on all sides and put it on to boil in abundant cold water.  When it
boils, reduce the heat, and simmer 2 hours.  When it's time to serve,
remove the meats and chicken from the pot, saving the broth.  Remove
the cotechino from its pot, and throw away that water.  Cut the
chicken in the usual pieces of leg, wing, half breast, etc. Skin the
tongue, and slice it very thin, slightly on the diagonal. Slice the
beef and the cotechino. Put all the meats and chicken on a large,
well-heated platter, baste with a bit of the hot broth and serve with
Salsa Verde (see recipe).  Strain the broth into another big pot.  If
you wish to clarify it, beat the egg whites slightly, bring the
strained broth to a boil, add the beaten egg whites, and let them
boil, beating with a whisk for about 2 minutes, or until the little
particles floating in the broth have been caught by the egg whites.
Pour through a cheesecloth-lined sieve into another pan.  Use half
the broth for cooking rice, pasta or gnocchi as a first course.  From
The Romagnolis' Table by Margaret & G. Franco Romagnoli.
