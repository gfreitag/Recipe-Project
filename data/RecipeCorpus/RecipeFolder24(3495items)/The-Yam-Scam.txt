Title: The Yam Scam
Categories: Vegetable, Information, Sweetpotato
Yield: 1 servings
-Yams can grow two to three
-feet long and some
-can weigh as much as 80
-pounds.  According to
-horticulturist U.P.
-edrick, the word 'yam'
-means "to eat" in the
-dialect of Guinea.  In the
-Unite States today it is
-possible to find true yams
-in some urban
-ispanic markets.
-Are Sweet potaotes the same
-as yams? No...and yes.
-Literally and
-botanically speaking, the
-two are not related.  Yams
-are large, starchy,
-edible turberous roots that
-belong to the genus
-DIOSCOREA. They grow in
-tropical and subtropical
-countries and require eight
-to ten months of
-warm weather to mature.
Both the yam and the sweet potato grow underground and have
yellowish-orange flesh, but there the similarity ends.  Yet the two
became entwined in this country by household vernacular in part
through the work of a publicity campaign.  Earlier this century,
sweet potato promoters attached the word yam to the deep orange,
moist fleshed varieties of sweet potatoes, and left the words "sweet
potato" to the smaller, yellowish, and drier fleshed varieties.  The
two types of sweet potato are interchangeable in cooking, but bring
different tastes, textures, and colors to your plate. Centennial and
Puerto Rico are two popular moist fleshed (formerly called yam)
varieties; Nemagold, New Jersey Orange, and Nugget have the lighter
and drier (sweet potato) flesh.

Today it is common to find either or both words used in supermarket,
although sweet ptoato promoters wish we would all stop saying yam.
The North Caroline SweetPotato Commission currently urges the world
to spell "sweetpotato" as one word.  But it's an uphill battle.  If
you Mama called them yams, for certain you will too.
