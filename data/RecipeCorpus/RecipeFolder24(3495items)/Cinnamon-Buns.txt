Categories: Diabetic, Vegetarian, Bread
Yield: 12 servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
3 c  Whole wheat flour
1 1/3 c  Lukewarm water
1 ts Honey
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 tb Cinnamon
2 tb Water
2/3 c  Raisins
1/2 c  Smooth natural peanut butter
1/4 c  Honey
1/2 c  Unsweetened applesauce
Combine the water, honey, and yeast in a large bowl.  Let sit for 5
minutes until foamy.  Add the flour 1 cup at a time, beating well
after each addition.  When the dough becomes to stiff to mix, turn it
out onto a floured board and knead for 5 to 10 minutes until smooth
and elastic. Put it in a very lightly oiled bowl, cover, and allow to
rise for 1 hour. <If a very light dough is desired, you may punch it
down, cover, and allow to rise another 40 to 45 minutes)

While the dough is rising, combine the peanut butter and honey in a
saucepan and mix over low heat until easily blended (or warm in
microwave until easily blended).  Beat in all the remaining
ingredients except the raisins.

Remove the risen dough from the bowl and knead about ten times on a
clean board.  Roll out into a large rectangle about 15" X 14". Spread
with filling to 1/2" of the edge.  sprinkle raisins evenly over the
filling. Roll the rectangle into a log, starting at the 15-in side,
pinch the edges to seal, and slice into 1" thick rounds. <They will
be VERY gooey> Place on a nonstick baking sheet, cover, and allow to
rise for about 20 minutes, or until light.  Bake in a preheated 350 F
oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown on top.
