24    Sheets phyllo dough
1/2 c  Unsalted butter, melted

Apples give a distinctive twist to this traditional Greek dessert.
Sauteing them first to let the water evaporate ensures a crisp crust.

Prep time:  1 hour plus cooling Baking time: 35 to 40 minutes

Apple Layer:  Peel and slice apples.  Melt butter in Dutch oven over
high heat.  Add apples, sugar and cinnamon; cook, stirring
occasionally, until apples are tender and juices are evaporated, 15
to 20 minutes. Cool.

Nut Mixture:  Combine all ingredients in small bowl.

Preheat oven to 400^F.  Trim phyllo sheets to 13x9-inch rectangles;
cover with plastic wrap.  Brush 13x9-inch metal baking pan with
butter. Place 1 phyllo sheet in pan and brush with some of the melted
butter (keep remaining phyllo covered). Layer 5 more phyllo sheets on
top, brushing each with butter. Spread 2 cups nut mixture on top and
repeat layering with 6 more phyllo sheets and butter.  Spread apple
mixture on top; repeat layering with 6 more phyllo sheets and butter.
Sprinkle remaining nut mixture on top; sprinkle with bread crumbs and
layer with the 6 remaining phyllo sheets and butter.

With sharp knife, cut lengthwise through pastry and filling into 1 1/2
inch-wide strips, then cut diagonally at 2-inch intervals to make
diamonds. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until golden. Drizzle honey on top
and bake 5
