Source: The National Culinary Review, Feb'94 The delicate flavors of
ginger, soy sauce and sesame blend beautifully with steamed tilapia,
served on a bed of spinach.  To complete the Asian theme, serve with
steamed rice and vinegared cucumber. 2 tablespoons sesame seeds 2
pounds fresh spinach, washed and stems removed, or 1 (16-ounce)
package frozen spinach, defrosted 2 tablespoons freshly grated ginger
1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
Salt and pepper 4 tilapia fillets (about 1 1/2 pounds total) Method:
Toast sesame seeds until evenly browned and fragrant. Drain, dry and
coarsely chop fresh spinach. If using frozen spinach, squeeze out
excess liquid.  Heat vegetable oil in a medium frying pan; add ginger
and cook, stirring, 30 to 60 seconds.  Add spinach and cook,
stirring, until warmed through, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in soy sauce and
season to taste with salt and pepper.  Season both sides of tilapia
fillets with salt and pepper.  Steam fillets until they flake easily
and are opaque all the way through, 8 to 10 minutes. While fillets
are cooking, reheat spinach.  Remove from heat and stir in half the
sesame seeds. Adjust seasoning.  Arrange spinach on 4 warmed dinner
plates, top with a tilapia fillet and sprinkle with remaining sesame
seeds. Submitted By SHERREE JOHANSSON   On   10-14-94
