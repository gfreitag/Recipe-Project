This roast chicken is extremely moist and tender.  The lemon is
refreshing on the rich, buttery skin.

Wash chicken and drain.  Sprinkle the oregano inside chicken, and
put the 2 cloves peeled garlic inside.  Melt butter in the roasting
pan and roll chicken in it; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Place
chicken, breast side down, in a pan and roast, uncovered, in a hot
oven (400 degrees (F)) for 45 minutes, or until golden brown.  Turn
chicken, breast side up, and continue roasting 30 to 45 minutes
longer, or until golden brown on top. Reduce heat to slow (300
degrees) and continue roasting 1 hour longer.

Squeeze lemon juice over all, put on the cover, and let stand in
the oven 15 minutes longer.  Remove to a platter, sprinkle with
oregano, and carve. Stir water into the drippings, heat, and pour
over the chicken.
