This salad is easy to prepare and keeps well.  It is always a
favorite at potlucks.Place the shredded cabbage in a large salad
bowl.Toast the almonds and sesame seeds by placing them in an
ovenproof dish and baking at 350 degrees for 5 to 10 minutes until
lightly browned and fragrant. Add to cabbage, along with the
onions.Coarsely crush the ramen noodles and add them to the salad,
uncooked, along with the packet of seasoning mix.Mix the dressing
ingredients together and pour over salad. Let stand 30 minutes or
more before serving.  The longer the salad stands, the softer the
noodles become.  Serves 6 generously. From: The Peaceful Palate by
Jennifer Raymond Tip @ class: Use maple syrup as sweetener.  Add
seasoning packet from soup to dressing instead of to salad (dissolves
and distributes better throughout salad).
