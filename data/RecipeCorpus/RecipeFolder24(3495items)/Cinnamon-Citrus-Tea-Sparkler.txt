Title: Cinnamon Citrus Tea Sparkler
Categories: Beverage
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  -=TO=-
1/2 c  Orange juice or tangerine
-juice concentrate, thawed
1 1/3 c  Tea concentrate (qv)
1    Cinnamon stick, 2" long
Orange peel (colored part)
2 1/3 c  Water, sparkling
Combine tea concentrate, orange peel and cinnamon stick in a
saucepan and bring to a boil.  Cover and chill until cold, about 1
hour. Discard orange peel and cinnamon stick and combine with
sparkling water. To make liquid layers, pour thawed orange juice into
bottom of each glass, then gently pour in tea concentrate.  Stir
before sipping.
(Or, dilute the concentrate to strength, and pour the tea onto a
spoon resting right on the surface of the juice layer.  The spoon
breaks up the vertical motion of the incoming liquid and helps keep
the layers separate.)
