Categories: Appetizer, Snack, Holiday, Kids
Yield: 1 servings

Red food coloring
Eggs; hard boiled

Cut hard boiled eggs in half lengthwise.  Remove yolks and make
filling for deviled eggs.  Cut out small hole from bottom center of
each egg (about 5/8" diameter.) Poke a black olive partway through
each hole and hold in place by filling eggs with yolk filling.  Place
each egg, olive side up, on a ritz cracker.  Paint red lines,
resembling blood veins, with a toothpick on the eye.
