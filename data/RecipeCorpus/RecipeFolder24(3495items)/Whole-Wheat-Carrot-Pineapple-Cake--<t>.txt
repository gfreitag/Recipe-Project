Title: Whole Wheat Carrot-Pineapple Cake  <t>
Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert
Yield: 1 servings
2    Egg whites or Ener-G
Replacements
1 c  Finely shredded carrot
1/2 c  Juice packed pineapple (with
Juice)
1 t  Vanilla (I was out and
Didn't miss it)
1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
3/4 c  Sugar
1 t  Baking powder
1 t  Baking soda
1 t  Cinnamon (or more to taste -
I like LOTS)
1/2 t  Salt (optional)
2/3 c  Applesauce
In a large mixing bowl, combine dry ingredients.  Make a well in the
center and add in remailing ingredients.  Mix well (use an electic
mixer if you want your cake especially light).  Bake in a Pam sprayed
8 or 9 inch square pan at 350F (180 C) for 30-35 minutes or until
toothpick-test done.* I didn't use a frosting-it was very moist and
yummy without. If you must, you could mix ff cream cheese, vanilla
and powdered sugar and frost with that.

*insert toothpick into center of cake.   If it comes out clean, the
cake is done.

Margie - I'm still working on the cookies!
