VEGETABLE EXCHANGE + 1 FAT EXCHANGE NANCY O'BRION NOTES: (What I
would do, becauce I LIKE mushrooms, I would just add some fresh
mushrooms instead of cream of mushroom soup and even the bag of
potato chips could be done away with. Depends on what it what kind
they are.) Source: Southern Living, Our Best Recipes by Lena Sturges
