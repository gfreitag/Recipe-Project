Title: Aunt Sara's Tarts
Categories: Dessert, Pie/tart
Yield: 10 servings
- Apple grated
1 ea Egg
2 tb Lemon Juice
1/4 c  Oleo (1/2 stick)
1/4 c  Currants
2 tb (Heaping) Cooked Apple or
- Apple Sauce or one small
Preheat oven to 450F.  Cream Oleo and Sugar, mix in the rest.  Fill
unbaked tart pastry 1/2 to 2/3 full.  Bake at 450F until pastry sets
(about ten minutes) then 375F until pastry is golden and top of the
pasty starts to brown (about 25 min.). Cool in muffin tin about 10
min.
~----Pastry=========================================================
Use about 1 1/4 c Flour for pastry (one crust pie).  After roll out,
cut into 3 1/2" to 4" circles (my cutter is 3 1/2" but I think 4"
would be better). Ease pastry circles into muffin tin cups to form a
small "pie" in each muffin cup.  Makes 10 Tarts.
~----Substitutes=====================================================
Apple:  I prefer a fresh grated apple (good eating apple such as Red
Delicious).  You can use Raisins in place of Currants, but not really
as good. Try Butter in place of Oleo, I prefer Oleo.  Realemon OK in
place of fresh Lemon Juice.
