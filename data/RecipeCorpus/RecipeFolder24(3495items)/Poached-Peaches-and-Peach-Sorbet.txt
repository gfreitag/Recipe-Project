peaches, ripe but firm Sorbet: syrup from cooking peaches 4 large
yellow peaches, ripe but firm sauce: 1 punnet ripe strawberries

To make syrup: put water and sugar into large pan and bring to the
boil. Boil for 4 minutes then remove saucepan from heat.

To poach peaches: plunge peaches one at a time in boiling water for a
few seconds.  Remove from water with slotted spoon; remove skins. Cut
peaches in half and remove stone; slide into syrup.  Gently poach
until just cooked.  Carefully remove peaches to a bowl and pour syrup
over, allow to cool.  Cover and chill.

To make sorbet: peel peaches as above, then puree in food processor.
Add most of peach syrup from bowl, leaving a little to keep peaches
moist. Make sorbet in an ice-cream maker according to manufac-

turer's instructions.

To make strawberry sauce: hull strawberries, and puree in food
processor. Add a little sugar if necessary.

To assemble: place one scoop of sorbet on a plate, put half a peach
on top, then drizzle strawberry sauce over. Bon-Appetit, Exec.Chef.
