Categories: Bread, Breadmaker, Fruit
Yield: 2 servings
1 1/2 T  Butter
1 1/2 T  Dry milk
1 t  Cinnamon
1 1/2 t  Dry yeast
1/2 c  Candied fruit
HITACHI
Using MIX BREAD cycle
1 1/8 c  Tap water
3 c  All purpose flour
1 t  Salt
1 T  Sugar
Place ingredients into pan according to manufacturers directions.
Add the candied fruit when the machine beeps during the kneading
cycle. **MY NOTES**  The original recipe called for 2 tbsp of sugar,
but I cut it down because of the sugar content in the candied fruit.
For the teaspoon of cinnamon, I used a combination of cloves,
cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice to EQUAL a teaspoon.  Next time I may
add a bit more spices. It came out smelling spicy, but the flavours
were more subdued that what I like...8-} I also used the dry
buttermilk powder in place of the dry milk. Crust came out nice and
light, it rose nicely, and turned out wonderful. 8-} Origin: Hitachi
