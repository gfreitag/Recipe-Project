Title: Lavender Shortbread
Categories: Dessert, Cake/cookie
Yield: 48 servings
1 tb Fresh mint, chopped
2 1/3 c  Flour
1/2 c  Cornstarch
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Butter (3 sticks)*
;room temperature
2/3 c  Sugar
2 tb Lavender florets, chopped
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
Lavender powdered sugar**
*No substitutes.

**To make lavender powdered sugar, put a few lavender flowers in a
sealed, pint jar of powdered sugar for a day before using sugar.

Preheat oven to 325 F.  Cover two baking sheets with parchment or
brown paper.

In a large bowl with an electric mixer, cream together the butter,
sugar, lavender and mint; mix until light and fluffy, about 3
minutes. Add flour, cornstarch and salt; beat until combined.  Divide
dough in half. Flatten into squares and wrap in plastic.  Chill until
firm.

On a floured board, roll or pat out each square to a thickness of
3/8". Cut the dough into 1 1/2" squares or rounds.  Transfer to
baking sheets, spacing cookies about 1" apart.  Prick each cookie
several times with the tines of a fork.

Bake 20 to 25 minutes until pale golden (do not brown).  Cool
slightly, then transfer to a rack.  Sprinkle with lavender powdered
sugar. Store in tin cookie boxes or sealed containers.

Yield: About 4 dozen.

Shepherd writes: "A lovely rich shortbread with a hint of sweet
lavender fragrance and flavor.  Perfect to serve with tea in the
afternoon."
