Categories: Greek, Stuffing, Burgers, Meat, Chicken
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 c  Walnut meats; chopped
1 1/2 ts Poultry seasoning
1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
2 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1 pk Zwieback; (6 oz.)
6    Eggs
1 lb Chestnuts; optional
3 md Onions
1/2 c  Water
1/2 lb Hamburger
8 oz Chicken livers; chopped
1/2 c  Butter; or margarine
3    Carrots; peeled & chopped
2    Celery stalks; sliced
You can either bake this stuffing in a separate pan or spoon it
inside a chicken or turkey and roast as usual.  The carrots and
raisins give the stuffing a pleasant sweetness; walnuts add a crunchy
texture.

Cut a 1/2 inch slit in the side of each chestnut, cover with boiling
water, cook 10 minutes, and drain; then peel and chop.  Peel and chop
onions; boil in the 1/2 cup water just until the water boils away.
Brown the hamburger, chopped livers, and cooked onions in butter
until meat is browned.  Add the chopped chestnuts, raisins, carrots,
celery, and nut meats; simmer 3 to 4 hours, or until very mushy.  (If
necessary, add more water.)

Add the poultry seasoning, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove the last
half hour of cooking.  Mash well with a potato masher.  Crush
zwieback finely and mix in.  Beat eggs until light, and stir into the
sloghtly cooled stuffing. Turn into a greased 9 inch square baking
pan, cover pan with foil, and bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees)
for 1 hour.
