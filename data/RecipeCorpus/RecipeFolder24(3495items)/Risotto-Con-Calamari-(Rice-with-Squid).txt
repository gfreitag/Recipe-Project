4 T  Olive oil

1/2 ea Chili pepper, deveined;
Clean the squid, reserving their ink sacs and the tentacles.  Cut the
squid into 1/2-inch-wide rings or into pieces.  Chop the tentacles.
In a wide, shallow casserole, preferably earthenware and about 12
inches across, heat the oil and saute the onion until it is wilted.
Add the squid rings and tentacles and saute for 5 minutes; then add
the chopped pimiento, tomato, garlic, parsley, salt, pepper, saffron,
and chili pepper. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Break the ink sacs
into a cup and mix with the wine. Pass this mixture through a sieve
several times until most of the ink is extracted. Reserve. Add the
rice and boiling hot broth to the casserole and stir in the ink
mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and cook over
medium-high heat, uncovered, and stirring occasionally, for 10
minutes, or until the rice is no longer soupy but some liquid
remains. Decorate with the pimiento strips and transfer to a
325-degree oven. Bake for 15 minutes, uncovered, until the liquid is
absorbed but the rice is not quite done.  Remove from the oven, cover
lightly with foil and let sit for 10 minutes. While the rice is
resting, make the garlic sauce. Place the crushed garlic in a
processor or blender. Very gradually, with the motor running, pour in
the oil.  Blend until smooth.  Serve separately. This recipe is based
on Penelope Casas' Arroz Negro from her excellent book The Foods and
Wines of Spain.  The result is a superb, rich black risotto. Use only
Italian short-grain rice; otherwise the dish will not work. The rice
will be mushy. Yield: 4-6 servings. Note: Serve this dish with a
salad and a dry white wine.
