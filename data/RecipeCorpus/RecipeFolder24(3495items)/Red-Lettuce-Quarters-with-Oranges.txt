Title: Red Lettuce Quarters with Oranges
Categories: Salad, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
1 T  Sherry or cider vinegar
2 t  Honey
2 t  Canned green peppercorns,
-drained and chopped
1 md Lettuce head, 6-8 oz (red
-oak leaf, leaf, or romaine)
2 lg Oranges
1/4 c  Reduced-fat mayonnaise
Lengthwise, cut lettuce through core into quarters. Immerse in water
and gently swish to remove dirt; shake gently to remove water. Wrap
in towels, slip into plastic bags, and chill 30 minutes or up to a
day.

Grate enough orange peel to make 1/2 teaspoon. Cut remaining peel and
white membrane off oranges. Over a bowl, cut between membranes to
remove orange sections. Squeeze membrane over bowl. Drain off all the
juice and measure; you need 3 tablespoons (save extra juice for
another use).

Whisk together the 3 tablespoons orange juice, orange peel,
mayonnaise, vinegar, honey, and peppercorns. If made ahead, cover and
chill fruit and dressing separately up to 4 hours.  On each of 4
salad or dinner plates, place 1 wedge of lettuce. Top with equal
portions of fruit and dressing. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On
