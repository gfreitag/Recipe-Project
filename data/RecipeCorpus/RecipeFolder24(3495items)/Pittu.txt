Title: Pittu
Categories: Main dish, Indian
Yield: 1 servings
75 ml Hot water
180 ml Thick coconut milk
250 g  Rice flour
250 g  Coconut
1/2 ts Salt
Roast and sieve the flour well. Grate  the coconut. Place the flour
in a bowl and add the salt.  Slowly pour in the hot water, mixing
with your fingers as you do so until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add
the grated coconut and mix well in. Place the mixture in the pittu
mould and place over a pan of boiling water until steam emerges from
the top of the pittu mould. Cover with  half a  coconut  shell  and
steam for a further 5 minutes or until done.

Note:  If a pittu mould is not available, mould dough into loaf
shape, wrap in muslin and steam   for about 15 minutes. From "A taste
of Sri Lanka" by Indra Jayasekera, ISBN #962 224 010 0
