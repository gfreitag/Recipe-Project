Preparation Time: 3:30

STEP ONE: To Make the Stock-- In large pot combine ducks, 2 stalks
celery, one small onion (sliced), diced carrots, salt, and gallon
water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 3 hours, from time to time
skimming off the foam.

STEP TWO: To Make the Gumbo-- Make the roux of flour and vegetable oil
until dark and brown. Add the bell peppers, red and black pepper,
celery, and onions. Remove the ducks from the stock and reduce the
broth to 2-1/2 quarts. Strain and pour over the roux. Simmer the
gumbo for 20 minutes.

Remove all the meat from the bones, dice in 1/2-inch squares, and add
to the gumbo. Broil the sausage, slice, and also add to the soup. Add
the oysters and scallions at last and bring to a boil.

Serve over rice with Tabasco sauce as needed.
