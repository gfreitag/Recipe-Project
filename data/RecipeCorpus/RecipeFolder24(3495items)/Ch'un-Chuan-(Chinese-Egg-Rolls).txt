About 3 hours before serving*:

1.  Make Shrimp Filling as follows: Mix shrimp, bean sprouts, celery,
mushrooms, 1 1/2 t salt, MSG and sugar, then refrigerate.

2.  Now make batter for Egg-Roll Wrappers by thoroughly combining
flour, 1 t salt, 3 eggs, beaten.  Then stir in 1 C water, a little at
a time, until a smooth, thin batter.

3.  Now cook the Egg Roll Wrappers as follows: Heat 1 t salad oil in a
skillet 7" across the bottom, over medium heat. Then pour in 3 T
batter (full 1/4 cup). Rotate skillet until batter covers bottom,
then let it cook until surface is set; do not turn.  When set,
carefully slide it onto paper toweling.  (If wrapper sticks roll one
edge of it over and loosen bottom with a spatula.)

4.  Wipe any particles from bottom of skillet, then repeat step 3
until all batter is used up,  letting each wrapper cool on its own
piece of paper toweling.

5.  Now fill each Egg Roll Wrapper as follows: Drain Shrimp Filling
well, then place 1 heaping Tablespoon of it, off center, on one of
the wrappers. Fold 2 sides of wrapper over filling, then brush
exposed part of wrapper with some of remaining egg, beaten. Next,
starting from filling end, roll up filling in wrapper. When all egg
rolls are filled, refrigerate them, uncovered, for 1 hour.

6.  Then to fry egg rolls: Heat 1" of salad oil in skillet to 375øF,
or until a 1" square of day-old bread browns in 40 seconds. Fry egg
rolls, two at a time, until well browned on both sides, draining them
on paper toweling.

7.  When all the egg rolls have been fried, reheat them, uncovered,
on a cookie sheet in a 400ø oven about 10 minutes.

8.  Meanwhile, for the Hot Mustard Sauce, stir enough water into dry
mustard to make it the consistency of mayonnaise.

9.  These Egg Rolls, with the Mustard Sauce are delicious before a
main dish of frozen or canned Chicken Chow Mein. Fruit and hot tea
make nice top-offs.

*If preferred, Egg Rolls can be made 1 week ahead, then wrap and
freeze. Or make 1 day ahead, then refrigerate.
