200 g white chocolate 7 egg yolks 150 g castor sugar 300 g unsalted
butter, softened pinch salt 150 g Amaretti biscuits, finely crushed
tablespoons chocolate liqueur (Ashanti Gold or creme de cacao) 500 ml
thickened cream Garnish: small Amaretti biscuits 2 tablespoons
chocolate liqueur 1/2 cup milk

Put chocolate in a bowl over hot water.  Cover and stand until
chocolate is melted.  Whip with spoon until smooth.  Beat yolks and
sugar together until sugar is dissolved and mixture is light and,
fluffy. Add melted chocolate and gently mix in with wooden spoon.
Beat butter, salt, Amaretti crumbs and liqueur until creamy.  Add two
mixtures together and whisk again. Beat cream and add to mixture,
beating with a whisk or electric beater until well mixed.  Butter a
22 cm oblong cake tin and line bottom with buttered greaseproof
paper. Dip amaretti biscuits in a mixture of liquer and milk, one at
a time, and arrange, upside down, in tin. Spoon in marquise mixture,
cover and refrigerate overnight.  Marquise must be very cold and well
set. Turn out and slice thinly as this is a very rich dessert.  Serve
with a raspberry or chocolate sauce. Bon-Appetit, Exec.Chef. Magnus
