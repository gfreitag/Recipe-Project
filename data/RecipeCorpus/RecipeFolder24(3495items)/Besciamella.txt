Title: Besciamella
Categories: Italian, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 12 servings
1/2 t  Salt
Freshly ground pepper to
-taste
8 T  Unsalted butter
3/4 c  Quick-mixing flour
4 c  Milk
1/2 t  Freshly grated nutmeg
Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over low heat.  Add the flour all
at once, and stir rapidly with a wire whisk until blended.  When you
use the quick-mixing flour that has a granular feeling, lumps never
form. With ordinary flour, lumps are a good possibility.  Heat the
milk to scalding (just under a boil, when a skin has formed on the
top), and add it all at once to the butter-flour mixture, stirring
vigorously with a whisk. Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring
constantly, until the sauce has thickened and is smooth, about the
consistency of a thin pudding. Add the nutmeg, salt, and a few grinds
of pepper. Cool the sauce for about 15 minutes before using. It
becomes firmer as it cools. From The Romagnolis' Table by Margaret &
G. Franco Romagnoli. Submitted By TERRI WOLTMON   On   10-01-94
