Title: Apricot Muffins
Categories: Diabetic, Bread
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 ts Ground cardamom or ginger;
1/3 c  Chopped walnuts;
3 tb Vegetable oil;
1 tb Sugar;
1    Egg;
1/2 c  Apricots; finely snipped
1/3 c  Unsweetened apple juice;
1 c  Whole wheat flour;
2 ts Baking powder;
1/4 ts Baking soda;
Soak the apricots in the apple juice for 10 minutes.  Combine the
flour, baking powder, baking soda, spice and walnuts in a bowl.  Beat
together the oil, sugar, and egg.  Add the apricots, with the juice
and egg mixture to the flour.

Mix just until all the ingredients are blended.  Spoon into oiled
muffin tins or (my choice) paper muffin cups (sprayed with non-stick
spray). Fill cups 3/4 full.  Bake in 350 F oven for 10 to 15 minutes,
or until golden brown.

Suggestions:  Use raisins to test the recipe if you do not have
apricots. Leave out walnuts to reduce the fat and use 2 egg whites
instead of the whole egg to reduce cholesterol if desired.
