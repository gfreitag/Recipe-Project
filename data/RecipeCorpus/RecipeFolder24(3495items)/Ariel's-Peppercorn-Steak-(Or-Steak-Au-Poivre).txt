Title: Ariel's Peppercorn Steak (Or Steak Au Poivre)
Categories: Main dish, Meat
Yield: 1 servings
Coarsley Crushed Peppercorns
Red Wine
Cream
Cognac
1 x  8 to 12 oz New York Sirloin
1/4 c  Olive Oil
1/4 c  Teriyaki Sauce
2 tb Worcestershire Sauce
1) Combine olive oil, teriyakia and worcestershire sauces to form a
marinade for the meat. Or, you may use a marinade recipe of your
choice. Marinade the steak at least a few hours, or overnight in
the
fridge turning the meat occasionally.

2) Crush enough peppercorns to cover the steak on both sides. Put the
crushed peppercorns on a cutting board and press the steak onto the
peppercorns to coat. Do the same for both sides of the steak.

3) Heat a heavy skillet (preferably cast iron with grill lines) and
plop
the steak into it. Depending on the meat and the marinade, you may
have
to add a bit of oil.

4) Cook both sides evenly until the meat is medium rare, or to your
liking.

5) Put the meat on a heated plate. Keep the liquid in the skillet and
add
some wine to deglaze the skillet. (ie collect all the remains into
a
sauce). Cook (fairly high heat) until the sauce thickens, stirring
occasionally.

6) For more sauce, or Steak au Poivre la Creme, add cream and cook a
little longer. Usually you need to do this to thicken the sauce.

7) Add cognac, cook some more. Sauce should always be thick. Pour
sauce
over steak and optionally flambe in cognac (Steak au Poivre
Flambe).

Serve with Parisienne potatos and carrots.
