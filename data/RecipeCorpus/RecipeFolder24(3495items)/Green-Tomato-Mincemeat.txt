1 ts Ground nutmeg
4 c  Chopped green tomatoes

Place the tomatoes in a non-aluminum container.  Sprinkle the
tomatoes with the coarse salt, let stand for 12 hours, and drain.

In a large non-aluminum pot, combine the tomatoes with all of the
remaining ingredients.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce
the heat to low and simmer gently, uncovered, stirring occasionally,
until thick, about 1 hour.

Pour into six 2-cup sterilized glass canning jars, cover tightly, and
refrigerate for up to 6 weeks.

store them for the winter on the shelf. Unfortunately, they don't
seem to survive more than a month, my whole family loves mincemeat!"
