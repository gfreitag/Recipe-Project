1 c  Mung bean sprouts
1 sm Bag potato chips -=OR=-
-- potato sticks, optional
1 lg Head lettuce, torn
2 md Tomatoes, quartered
1 sm Red onion, thinly sliced
1 md Carrot, thinly sliced

MMMMM----------------PEANUT-COCONUT MILK DRESSING---------------------
-- butter
1/2 c  White vinegar
1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
1 1/2 c  Coconut milk
1 tb Red curry paste, see recipe
2 c  Unsalted chunky peanut
SALAD: Arrange the lettuce, tomatoes, onion, carrot & cucumber in a
salad bowl & lightly toss.  Add the bean curd & sprouts.  Top with
the peanut- coconut milk dressing & garnish with potato chips.

DRESSING: In saucepan over medium heat, stir the coconut milk & red
curry paste together until the mixture turns to a pale amber & a thin
coat of oil appears on the surface.  Add the remaining ingredients &
stir over a low heat for 7 to 10 minutes, or until all the
ingredients are thoroughly mixed.  The colour will be a pale cocoa
brown. Let cool to room temperature for 1 hour before serving with
the salad.

The dressing will keep in the refrigerator for a month, but it does
have a tendency to thicken.  To bring it back to its correct
consistency, add 1/2 ts to 1 tb white vinegar & stir vigorously.
