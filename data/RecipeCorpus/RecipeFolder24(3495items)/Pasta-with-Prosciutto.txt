Title: Pasta with Prosciutto
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Diced Prosciutto
4 T  Chopped Parsley
1 ea Freshly ground black pepper
4 ea Lightly beaten eggs
4 T  Butter
1 1/2 lb Dried Spinch Pasta
1 ea Salt
3/4 c  Heavy Cream
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan Cheese
Melt the butter in a large pan and add the prosciutto.  Saute for 4-5
minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat and set aside.

Cook the pasta in boiling salted water until it is "al dente".  Drain
and add to the sauteed prosciutto.  Add the parsley, salt and pepper
to taste, and the cream.  Toss well and put over very low heat until
it is very hot.
Remove from heat and add the eggs, tossing to distribute them well.

Serve immediately and pass the parmesan cheese separately.
