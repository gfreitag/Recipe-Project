WARNING!  This is not a recipe for company. It is an oriental
equivalent to macaroni and cheese or sloppy joes. Quick, tasty, and
flexible. My wife thinks this is just what a busy houseman(wife)
needs. I try to include it at least once a week in our meals.  It is
not scientific and any similarity to jokes of the "Take one from
column A, and two from column B" variety is fully intentional.  The
quantities are not expected to be exact, nor the results.  This
tastes the same, yet different, each time.

OK, here we go.  Look in your refrigerator and see what you've got,
then start.  Remember, after you have cleaned and cut your
ingredients the cooking time is less then 15 min. so have your table
set before you put the meat to the heat.

Take one from column A, and two from column C, OR Take one from
column A, and one from column B, and one from column C.

Before heating up the Wok it is wise to start the rice cooking.

Mix the water and flour together.  Heat up the wok on high heat with
half the oil and add the ingredients from column A.  When the
ingredients are cooked but not well done throw the  ingredients from
column C in. Without stirring, add the remaining seasonings on top.
Let things saute a little then toss to spread the oil and seasonings.
Put the top on.

Check your rice now!

Wait a min. and then toss again.  Toss every min. or so until the
vegetables are cooked but still crisp.  Add the ingredients from
column B (if any.) Stir a few times and turn down the heat.  Now you
add the water (more if you want more gravy, less water without flour
if you want a natural gravy) and toss one more time.  Cover and let
sit.

Your rice should be finished now.  Serve the Rice and the "Wok Luck"
separate.

The above works for a family of 2 adults and 2 small children. Adjust
for your group.
