In a large bowl, mix together the flours, oats, salt & sunflower
seeds. Add oil, warm millet, yeast & remaining warm water.  Mix into
a stiff dough. If too stiff, add more water, or add more water if too
sticky. The dough should be light & spongy.  Knead vigorously for 10
minutes.

Divide dough into 2 equal portions.  Lightly oil loaf pans, roll our
dough & place in pans.  Lightly brush the tops of the loaves with oil
& let rise in warm place for 30 minutes.  Bake at 375F for about 30
minutes or until lightly browned.  Lightly oil the crust to tenderize.
