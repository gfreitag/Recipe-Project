In a heavy flameproof 4 to 5 quart casserole, heat the olive oil,
tipping the casserole to coat the bottom evenly and turning the heat
down to moderate if the oil begins to smoke.  Pat the chicken dry
with paper towels and brown it in the oil, a few pieces at a time.
Start the pieces skin side down and turn them with tongs.  Add the
wine, vinegar, water, onions, carrots, leek, salt and bouquet, and
bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover the
casserole, and simmer undisturbed for 30 minutes, or until the
chicken is tender but not falling apart. Remove the bouquet, and
arrange the chicken pieces in a deep serving dish just large enough
to hold them snugly in one layer. Pour the cooking liquid with the
vegetables over the chicken.  Decorate the top with the lemon slices,
and cool to room temperature.  Cover the dish and refrigerate for at
least 6 hours, or until the cooking liquids have jelled.  serve on
chilled plates, as the first or the main course.
