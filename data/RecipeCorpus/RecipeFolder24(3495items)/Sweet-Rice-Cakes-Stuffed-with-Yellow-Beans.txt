Title: Sweet Rice Cakes Stuffed with Yellow Beans
Categories: Dessert, Thai, Rice, Vegetarian, Beans
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb White sesame seeds
1/4 c  Sugar
2 c  Rice flour
1/2 c  Yellow mung beans
2 c  Dessicated coconut
1/2 ts Salt
Simmer the mung beans in 1 c cold water for 20 minutes.  Drain & set
aside. Mix the coconut with the salt, sprinkle evenly n a plate & set
aside. In a small pot, over low heat, toast the sesame seeds until
light brown. Mix the seeds into the sugar evenly spread on the dish &
set aside.

In a large bowl, mix the rice flour with 1/2 c water & knead into a
dough the consistency of pie crust.  Mold into 1 1/2" balls, then
flatten with the palm of your hand to form patties 1/8" thick & 2"
wide. Fill a large bowl half full with water & bring to a boil. Cook
the rice cakes for 4 to 5 minutes or until they start to float.

While still hot, coat each side of the cakes with the coconut-salt
mixture. Place 1/4 to 1/2 ts of the mung beans into the centre of
each cake. Fold the edges over & pinch closed to form a half circle.
Dip each into the sesame seed-sugar mixture, coating both sides well.
Serve hot or cold. They will keep in the refrigerator  for 2 to 3
days.
