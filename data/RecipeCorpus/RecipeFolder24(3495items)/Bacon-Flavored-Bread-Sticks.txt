2 pkg active dry yeast 2 cups lukewarm milk (105-115 degrees) 1/2 cup
butter or regular margarine, melted 1 tsp salt 1 tsp sugar 1 tsp
ground cardamom 5 1/2 to 6 cups sifted flour 1 lb bacon 1 1/4 cup
chopped onions 1 egg, beaten Coarse salt

In large bowl dissolve yeast in warm milk. Add butter, salt, sugar,

Place in greased large bowl, turning dough over so that top is
greased. Cover with towel; let rise in warm place until doubled,
about 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, in 12" skillet over medium heat, cook bacon and onions

Cool completely.

Punch down dough. Cover and let rest 10 minutes.

On lightly floured surface knead bacon mixture into dough. Roll dough

Cut dough in half to make 2 rectangles. Cut each rectangle into thirds
crosswise to make smaller rectangles. Cut each small rectangle into 6
sticks about 4 1/2 " long.

Place sticks 2" apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise
until doubled, about 30 to 45 minutes.

Bake in 375 degree oven 15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.

Makes 36 sticks.
