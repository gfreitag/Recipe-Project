Title: Basil Beer Bread
Categories: Bread, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 loaf
1/2 c  Chopped fresh basil leaves
1 1/2 c  Warm beer
3 c  Self-rising flour
3 tb Sugar
Preheat the oven to 350 F.

In a large bowl, mix the flour and sugar.  Stir in the basil, then the
beer.  Mix until thoroughly blended, then pour into a well greased
9x5x3" loaf pan.  Bake until a straw inserted in the center comes out
clean, about 50 minutes.  Turn the bread out of the pan and cool on a
rack. Slice the bread thinly.

The authors write: "Before the Burpee Seed Company introduced its
Purple and Green Ruffles basil varieties, they asked prominent
gardeners such as C.Z. Guest and Elvin McDonald to test-grow the
plants. In one corner of her gracious Long Island estate, Mrs. Guest
has a working garden where she and Elvin grow herbs and vegetables
for the kitchen and flowers for bouquets, and where they work with
new plants. When they were asked to test the Ruffles basils, they
decided to investigate other basil species at the same time, checking
on their appearance in the garden as well as the different flavors
they might bring to the kitchen. 'Since we both write syndicated
columns about gardening, we're constantly experimenting,' says Elvin.

"Globe basil, a favorite edging plant; curly basil, a beautiful
garnish as well as a tasty seasoning; aromatic lemon basil; and spicy
cinnamon basil were among those grown and harvested for use in the
kitchen. 'Both C.Z. and I like simple foods,' Elvin says, 'so I love
to experiment with new flavors in old standbys like baked apples or
bread.'"
