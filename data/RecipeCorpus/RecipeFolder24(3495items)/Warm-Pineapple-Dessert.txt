Title: Warm Pineapple Dessert

1/2 c  Dark rum
1 lg Ripe pineapple
2 T  Brown sugar
Remove green top and place pineapple on the barbecue, as far away
from the flame as possible.  Turn the pineapple so that it cooks on
all sides. The object is to heat it through, and as this is done so
slowly, the pineapple will appear to be very ripe when the cooking is
finished. Cook for 1 hour or more if necessary.  The outside of the
skin should not be burnt, only well scorched. Mix the brown sugar and
rum, and when you have peeled and sliced the hot pineapple, pour a
little of the mixture over each slice. Bon-Appetit, Exec.Chef. Magnus
