"Whenever I'm invited to attend a potluck, people usually ask me to
bring this tempting caserole.  The turkey, ham and cheese are
delectable combined with the crunchy

topping.  When I bake a turkey, I prepare the leftovers for this dish,
knowing I'll be making it again soon." - Joyce Paul 4 cups cubed
