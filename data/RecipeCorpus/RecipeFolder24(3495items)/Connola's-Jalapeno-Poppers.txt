Title: Connola's Jalapeno Poppers
Categories: Tex/mexican, Vegetable, Appetizer
Yield: 12 servings
1 ts Parmesan; grated
-or Locatelli or Romano
Salt & Pepper
1 1/2 c  Bread Crumbs; seasoned or
-unseasoned
Vegetable Oil
-for deep frying
12 lg Jalapenos; seeded and
-cut in half
2 c  Monterey Jack Cheese
-shredded
1 lg Egg
2 tb Milk
1 tb Flour
Wash jalapenos, cut in half and take out seeds.  Stuff each half with
grated jack cheese. In shallow bowl, mix flour, egg, parmesan, milk,
salt & pepper to taste. Place breadcrumbs in flat dish. Dip jalapeno
in egg mixture and then in breadcrumbs.  Place in freezer for 1/2
hour. Take out of freezer and deep fry in hot oil until golden brown.
The seasoned breadcrumb will give you more flavor and since it is
salted, you don't need to add much salt to the egg mixture. The
unseasoned breadcrumb will give your coating more of a firm
consistency when fried.

VARIATIONS: Use jack cheese with pimentos for a mild flavor, or
jalapenos for a double inferno.  Also, add some chili powder and/or
cumin to the egg mixture for a more "Mexican" type flavor.
