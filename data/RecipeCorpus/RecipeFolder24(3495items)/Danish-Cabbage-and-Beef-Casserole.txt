Title: Danish Cabbage and Beef Casserole
Categories: Beef, Casserole, Vegetable, European
Yield: 1 servings
1/8 ts Cinnamon
1/8 ts Ground cloves
1/4 ts Thyme
1/4 ts Basil
4 c  Shredded cabbage
1 lb Ground beef
1 md Onion
1    Clove garlic minced
1 ts Salt
15 oz Tomato sauce
Brown the ground beef in a large skillet with the onions and garlic,
drain off the fat. Add the remaining ingredients except cabbage to
the meat mixture, and simmer for 10 minutes. Put half of the cabbage
into a 2-quart casserole dish, top with half of the meat mixture, top
with the remaining cabbage, and finally top the cabbage with the
remaining meat mixture. (The casserole dish will be rather full, but
that's OK, it will cook down).

Cover the casserole and bake in an oven preheated to 350F / 175C for
45 minutes.
