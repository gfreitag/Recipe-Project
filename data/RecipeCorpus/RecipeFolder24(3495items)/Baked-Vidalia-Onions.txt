-=OR=-
Cut onion down to the root end in 8 wedges.  Do not cut through the
root so onion stays together.  Divide butter in 4 pats and place one
on top of each onion.  Wrap each onion separately in foil.  Sprinkle
with crumbs and salt and lots of freshly ground pepper to taste. Bake
at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until onions are soft. Randy Rigg
