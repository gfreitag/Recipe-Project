Equipment (cont'd) ******************

Optional Equipment: *******************

Free standing, heavy duty mixer; 5 quart capacity is my preference.
These mixers come with a paddle, a whip, and a dough hook. If you
plan to make many cakes, I suggest you purchase an extra mixing bowl
and whip attachment.

Food Processor, great for chopping nuts and making pie crusts.

Electric knife: almost nothing works better than an electric knife for
cutting beautiful slices of cake. Electric knives cut right through
the toughest of nuts or the most ornery raisins.

Drum sifter, very efficient when sifting large quantities. Be sure to
have a mixing bowl just the right diameter of your sifter, to be the
most efficient.

Ice Cream Scoops: #12, #24 and #40, these are indispensable for well
formed muffins and cookies, as well as for scooping perfect rounds of
ice cream.

Apple peeler/corer/slicer: for peeling, coring and slicing apples. A
wonderful hand operated tool that saves much time and energy and
applies. A must if apple pie is your family's favourite.

Marble surface, because marble stays cool in any weather, it is
wonderful for rolling out pie dough or for working with puff pastry.

Pastry wheel for cutting lattice strips for pies. Purchase the kind
that has 2 cutting wheels, one fluted and one plain.

Ruler for cutting straight lattice strips, or straight puff pastry,
or for measure dough for cinnamon rolls.

Kitchen scale, by far the most accurate method of measure
ingredients, as there is less room for error.

Doilies for placing under pies, tarts, and cakes.

Cardboard cake rounds, 8 inch and 10 inch.

Cake turntable, makes frosting and decorating cakes much easier.
