4 oranges 1 teaspoon salt water 2 cups castor sugar 3 tablespoons
castor sugar (extra) 155 g dark chocolate

Cut oranges in half and remove flesh and pith.  Cut rinds in 1 1/4 cm
strips.  Combine salt and 2 cups water.  Add pieces of rind.  Stand
the mixture overnight, drain and put orange strips in a pan with 4
cups of water.  Boil gently for 20 minutes.  Remove from heat, drain
and stand orange on cake rack to dry.

Put sugar and 1 1/4 cups water in a pan and stir over low heat until
sugar has dissolved.  Add rinds and boil until transparent (15
minutes). Strain off the syrup.  Spread strips on a cake rack and
sprinkle liberally with rest of castor sugar.  Spread them on an oven
tray and cook in 100'C oven for 40 minutes to dry.  Melt chocolate in
top of a double boiler and dip the orange rinds.  Store in an
airtight tin. Pat Hobson. Bon-Appetit, Exec.Chef. Magnus Johansson
