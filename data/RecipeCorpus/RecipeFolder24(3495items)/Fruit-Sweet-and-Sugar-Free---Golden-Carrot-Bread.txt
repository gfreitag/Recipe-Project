Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Golden Carrot Bread
Categories: Bread, Fruit
Yield: 2 loaves
1/2 c  Butter
1/3 c  Fruit sweetener
2/3 t  Salt
5 c  Unbleached white flour
3 md Carrots
2 c  Water
1 1/2 t  Dry baker's yeast
2 t  Fruit Sweetener
1/3 c  Lukewarm water
Pell and slice the carrots, cook them with the 2 cups of water in a
small covered pot until soft. Drain carrots, reserving 3/4 cup of the
cooking water. Puree the carrots and the reserved cooking water in a
blender or food processor. Stir the yeast and 2 teaspoons of
sweetener into the 1/3 cup lukewarm water. Set aside until the yeast
is bubbly, about 5 minutes.

To prepare the dough by machine: ********************************
Melt the butter or margarine and combine it with the remaining 1/3
cup of sweetener, the pureed carrots, and the salt in the bowl of an
electric mixer. When the mixture is lukewarm, use the dough hook to
stir in the activated yeast and 5 cups of the flour to form a medium
soft dough. Once the flour is incorporated, increase the mixer speed
to medium and knead the dough for 5-7 minutes, adding only enough
additional flour to form a dough that comes off both the sides and
bottom of the bowl.

To prepare the dough by hand: ***************************** Melt the
butter and combine it with the remaining 1/3 cup sweetener, the
pureed carrots and the salt in a medium bowl. When the mixture is
lukewarm, stir in the activiated yeast and 5 cups of flour to form a
medium soft dough. Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface. Turn
out the dough onto your table and knead it, adding additional flour
only if necessary to keep the dough from sticking. Knead the dough
for 10 to 15 minutes, until it becomes smooth and quite elastic.

Raising the dough and forming Loaves or Rolls:
********************************************** Place the well kneaded
dough in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic and let
the dough rise in a warm, draft free place until doubled. Remove the
plastic from the bowl and, using your fist, gently deflate the dough
by punching it down. Knead the dough in the bowl 8 to 10 times. Cover
the bowl with plastic wrap and again let the dough rise until
doubled. Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a very lightly
floured surface. Form the dough into two loaves or 20 rolls, or a
combination of both. Place the loaves into standard size bread pans,
and rolls onto baking paper lined baking sheets. Place the rolls
three inches apart to allow room for them to spread as they rise.
Lightly cover the bread and/or rolls with an oiled piece of plastic,
and let the dough rise until doubled in size. Preheat oven to 350
degrees. For loaves, use a serrated knife to make a diagonal slash
across the tops of the loaves. Place them on the middle shelf in the
preheated oven, and bake for 45 to 50 minutes. The tops will be
golden brown and the bread will slide easily out of the baking pans
when the loaves are done. Give the bottom of the loaf a tap, it
should sound hollow. Let the loaves cool out of their pans on a wire
rack. For rolls bake them for 25 minutes until they are golden brown.
Remove the rolls from the baking pan and cool them on a wire rack.
