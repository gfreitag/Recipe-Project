Categories: Poultry, Turkey, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2 t  Capers
1 c  Cool chicken broth or water
-mixed with
2 t  Cornstarch
1/2 c  Pine nuts, toasted
1 1/2 lb Boneless turkey fillets
Salt
Pepper
Bakers Joy vegetable spray
1/2 c  Dark or golden raisins
1/2 c  Dry white wine
Pat the turkey fillets dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper.

You will probably need to sear the turkey in batches so that it will
brown. Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Spray
one side of the turkey fillets with Bakers Joy. Cook 1-2 minutes or
until golden. Spray the remaining side, turn and cook for an
additional minute. Hold seared turkey fillets on a warm plate and
repeat with remainder.

Add the raisins, wine, capers and chicken broth mixed with cornstarch
to the same pan, stirring constantly until slightly thickened. Return
turkey to the pan to heat.

Serve turkey on individualy plates with sauce spooned over the top.
Sprinkle each portion with toasted pine nuts.
