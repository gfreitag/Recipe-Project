Tested in DAK 1-1/2-lb R2D2.  Sylvia's comments: GREAT bread for
times when you need an extremely portable meal.  As I modified it, it
really tastes like chicken and stuffing!  I took this on a trip to
have something meal-like to feed the kids right in the car, and they
loved it. Save this recipe to use up your Thanksgiving/Christmas
leftovers!
