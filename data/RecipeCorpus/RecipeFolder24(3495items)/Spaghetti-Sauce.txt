Title: Spaghetti Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
None
I just make my own. Takes about 10 minutes to chop and 20-40 minutes
to simmer, depending on how soft you want the tomatoes. Amounts are
approximate, since I never measure anything for this.

In a large pan combine:

1/2   red onion (if I feel oniony, I use a whole one) 6-12 Roma
tomatoes, chopped coarsely 1 can Italian style tomatoes with juice 1
can tomato sauce (large)

1 heaped tablespoon tomato paste (if you like the taste of tomato
paste, use more; if you hate the taste of tomato paste, skip it and
use corn starch (see below))

spice to taste with sweet paprika and ground white pepper.

Bring to a boil, then simmer stirring occasionally until about 10
minutes from done. That is usually when the sauce starts to thicken a
bit and the tomatoes are soft. Then add:

1/2 pound of mushrooms (If I feel mushroomy, I use 1 pound) 1/2 pound
of tofu in small cubes (optional) 1/2 bunch of chopped parsley
Optional herbs: fresh basil leaves or fresh oregano

Simmer for 10 more minutes and serve.

Note: If you want the sauce to thicken faster, add some cornstarch
and cook on high for a while. Remember to dissolve the cornstarch in
a bit of cold water before adding it. I use one heaped teaspoon.

This serves 2 very hungry people for a main dish and there is usually
enough left for a small leftover dinner.
