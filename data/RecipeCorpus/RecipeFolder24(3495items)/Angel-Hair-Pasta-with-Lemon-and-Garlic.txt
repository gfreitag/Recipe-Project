Title: Angel Hair Pasta with Lemon and Garlic
Categories: Pasta, Italian, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 servings
4 oz Semoliina angel hair pasta
- dried
1/4 c  Fresh basil, chopped
2 tb Parmesan cheese,
- freshly grated
Black pepper, freshly ground
- to taste
1 ts Olive oil
2    Garlic cloves, peel & mince
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/4 c  Lemon juice, freshly squeeze
1 c  Tomato, chopped (1 medium)
4 oz Spinach angel hair pasta
- dried
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat and maintain at a
boil.

Put the olive oil and garlic in a saut* pan and cook over medium heat
just until the garlic begins to brown.  Remove the saut* pan from the
heat and pour in the wine.  Return it to the heat.  Cook for another
1 to 2 minutes, until the wine has been reduced by half.  Stir in the
lemon juice and tomato.  Remove the pan from the heat.

Place the pasta in the boiling water and cook to desired doneness, 30
seconds to 1 minute.  Drain the pasta and put it into a warm serving
bowl. Add the basil, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper, along with
the tomato mixture.  Toss and serve immediately.

Delicate angel hair pasta demands a light and elegant sauce, such as
this simple white wine mixture flecked with bits of fresh tomato and
basil. It's a terrific first course of luncheon dish.  I find the
spinach and semolina varieties to be somewhat sturdier than plain
wheat-flour angel hair pasta, but you still need to handle them
carefully. Cook for only 30 seconds to 1 minute, toss, and serve
immediately.
