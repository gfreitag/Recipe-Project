Title: Soapmaking Substitutions
Categories: Homemade, Information
Yield: 1 servings
No Ingredients Found
Substitutions: Do not substitute oils, coloring or any thing else in
the recepie. Oils have different sponification points they require
different amounts of lye

to make soap. Food coloring will not work in soap. It seems to
dissapear. Use nothing but essential oils to scent soap. Perfumes and
other scents will cause the soap to separate and you'll have a mess
instead of soap. Origin: Crafting Echo Shared by: Donna Merrill
