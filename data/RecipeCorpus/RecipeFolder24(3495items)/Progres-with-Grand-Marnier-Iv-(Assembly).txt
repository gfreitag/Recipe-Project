Syrup: ======

In a small saucepan, bring the water and sugar to a boil.  Take
off of the heat and cool in refrigerator.  Add Grand Marnier to
cooled syrup and reserve.  (Note: three-fourths of this syrup-Grand
Marnier mixture will be used in the mousse; the remainder will be
used to bunch the various layers of the Progres.)

Creme Noisette: ===============

Put the hazelnut paste and Kirsch into a bowl and mix with a
spatula. Add 4 ounces of buttercream and blend well.  Refrigerate for
5 minutes.

Chocolate Cream: ================

Melt the chocolate, then cool.  Add half of the chocolate to the
buttercream.  Mix well, then add remainder of the chocolate (must be
done in steps or cream will break).  Refrigerate.

Assembly: =========

Remove the biscuit from the refrigerator and cut it to the shape
of the mold.  Put bottom biscuit into mold and brush with syrup.
Spread layer of creme noisette on top of syrup.  Refrigerate for 2
minutes.

Add a layer of mousse, then place top biscuit on mousse.  Brush
with syrup again, then spread with a layer of chocolate cream.
Freeze for 5 - 30 minutes.

Pipe layer of chocolate cream on top.  Unmold and serve on tray
with garnish of sugar and real flowers.
