3 cups (approx) freezable whipped topping (ER's favorite) may be made
with 2 tb. icing or confectioner's sugar.  This is from another file
called Mock Whipped Cream. 10 calories/2 tb, 1.48 gm carbohydrate
estimated. Mix with fruit and freeze, or serve on top of slightly
thawed fruit - it takes about a cup of home-made whipped topping to
make the calories or carbohydrates of a milk exchange.
