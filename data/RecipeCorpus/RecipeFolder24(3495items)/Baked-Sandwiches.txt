Categories: Diabetic, Sandwich, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 12 servings
1 1/2 lb Lean ground beef
1/2 c  Chopped onions
1 c  Tomato sauce
1/4 c  Catsup
1 ts Garlic salt
1/2 ts Leaf oregano
1 pn Pepper
1 1/4 c  Water at 110 to 115 F
2 1/4 ts Quick-rise yeast (1 pkg)
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1    Egg
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 1/2 c  Graham flour
FILLING
May be frozen.  Defrost in the fridge, on the way to a picnic or in
the microwave if you want them in a hurry.

Combine water and yeast in mixer bowl and let stand 5 minutes.  Add
all purpose flour and mix at medium speed for another 4 minutes. Turn
the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead a few times,
form into a ball and place in a well-greased mixing bowl. Turn the
ball over to grease the top, cover with a cloth and let stand at room
temperature to rise until doubled in volume.

While the dough is rising, cook the meat and onions over medium heat,
stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and the meat is
browned. Drain.  Discard fat and juice, return meat and onions to the
pan. Add tomato sauce, catsup, seasoning and cook over medium heat
until the meat is dry with no noticeable liquid.  Set meat mixture
aside to cool until dough is ready.

After the dough has doubled in volume, transfer it to a lightly
floured working surface.  Knead lightly.  Form into a roll and cut
into 12 equal portions.  Form each portion into a little ball, cover
with a cloth and let rest for 10 minutes.

Roll each ball out to form a circle 5 to 6 inches across.  Put about
1/4 cup of the meat mixture in the center of the circle.  Pull the
dough up around the filling and press together at the top.  Place on
a well greased cookie sheet, cover with a cloth and let stand about
30 to 40 minutes at room temperature or until doubled in volume. Bake
at 350 F for 40 to 45 minutes or until lightly browned and firm.
Serve hot, using 1 sandwich per serving, or refrigerate or freeze to
be used later.
