Line a colander with a double-layer of cheesecloth or other suitable
filter (I use a porous cloth napkin). Place the colander over a large
bowl to catch the dripping whey. Spoon the yogurt into the colander.
Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6-24 hours. The
longer the refrigeration time, the thicker the resulting "cheese."
Discard the whey, or use it in soups or casseroles. (Whey contains
significant amounts of calcium and potassium.)

Per 1 tb of unseasoned yogurt cheese: 16 calories, 2 grams protein, 2
gram carbohydrates, 0 gram fiber, 0 gram fat, 22 milligrams sodium.
