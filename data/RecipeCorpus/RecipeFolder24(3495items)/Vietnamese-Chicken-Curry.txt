1 ts Ground cumin
1 tb Minced fresh lemongrass or
1 ts Sereh (lemongrass) powder
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/16    To 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper

1/3 c  Unsweetened coconut milk
1 c  ;Water
1 ts Vietnamese fish sauce

1 ts Canola oil or

4    Chicken breast halves

2 tb Minced shallots or
2    Garlic cloves; mashed
2    To 3 tsp. minced fresh or
-- rehydrated turmeric
-or-
1 1/2 ts Ground dried turmeric
1 ts Ground cinnamon
Heat oil in a large skillet over a moderate flame until very hot but
not quite smoking.  Add the chicken breasts and saute, turning once,
until golden.  Add shallots and spices, using the smallest quantity
of cayenne and adding more later to taste.  Saute until the
ingredients are fragrant, then add the coconut milk, water and fish
sauce. Cover the skillet and simmer 10 to 20 minutes, or until
chicken is cooked through. Serve immediately.

Carlson writes: "Curries appear in all Southeast Asian and Indian
cuisines. Fresh turmeric gives more pungency to this Vietnamese dish,
but dried turmeric, either store-bought or rehydrated and ground at
home, is a satisfactory substitute."
