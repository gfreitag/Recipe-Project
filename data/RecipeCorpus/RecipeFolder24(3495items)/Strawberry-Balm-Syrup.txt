"Delicious with ice cream, waffles, or in a drink. Try making it with
lemon verbena or lemon thyme, too."

To make a drink: put several tbsps in bottom of glass, add cold or
sparkling water and ice.

Wash and hull the strawberries, place in a bowl, and crush with the
back of a wooden spoon or a potato masher. Line a medium bowl with
cheesecloth, pour the crushed strawberries and their juice into the
cloth, then gather up the corners and squeeze until all the juice has
been extracted. Weigh the juice, then combine it with an equal amount
of sugar and the lemon balm in a non-aluminium saucepan. Bring to a
boil and boil it for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, skim any foam
from the top, and let cool. Discard the lemon balm before bottling.
Store in the refrigerator.
