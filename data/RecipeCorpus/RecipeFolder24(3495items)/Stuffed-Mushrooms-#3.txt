Sliced Ripe Olives
Preheat oven to 325øF.  Remove the stems from the mushrooms and
reserve them for another recipe. If you want you can mince some of
the stems and include them with the stuffing mix.  Combine the bread
crumbs with the sour cream and mix until well blended.  Add onion and
green peppers.  Mix well. Fill each mushroom cap with the stuffing
mix and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 20 - 30 minutes or until
hot.  Remove from oven.  Garnish with sliced olives and serve as a
great appetizer.  CAUTION:  Since mushrooms contain a large amount of
water it is necessary for these little beauties to cool a little
before eating.  The very hot water in them can cause burns to the
mouth and then your guests can't enjoy the entree. From: Syd's
