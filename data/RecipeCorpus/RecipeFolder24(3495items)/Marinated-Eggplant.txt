Title: Marinated Eggplant
Categories: Vegetable, Masterchefs
Yield: 6 servings
2 1/2 c  Oil, olive
1/2 c  Vinegar, red wine
Flour
Salt
Pepper
1 md Eggplant
4 lg Eggs
2 ts Parsley
6 ea Bay leaves
1 ts Rosemary, (opt)
3 md Garlic, cloves, crushed
Cut the eggplant into slices of about 3/4-inch thick.  Arrange
them on a dishtowel, side by side, and sprinkle them with salt.  Let
them "rest" for about 10 minutes (the salt helps to leach out the
water and prepare the surface of the eggplant to accept the coatings
and marinade) and then wipe them dry.  Set them aside for later.

In a bowl, beat the eggs with the parsley, a pinch of salt, and
pepper.

Heat 2 cups of oil in a deep skillet.

Flour the eggplant slices lightly, then dip them in the egg
"wash." Saute the individual slices in hot oil until golden brown
(about 1 minute each side) then place them on an absorbent towel to
cool.

Meanwhile, pour the remaining oil into a heavy saucepan with the
crushed garlic.  Saute the garlic until it's golden.

Remove the heavy saucepan from the heat and add vinegar.

Return to heat and add bay leaves, rosemary, and pepper to
taste, then simmer for 1 minute.  Set aside.

In a bowl with a lid, assemble one layer of eggplant then
sprinkle liberally with marinade.  Add another layer of eggplant and
sprinkle with marinade.  Continue the process until all of the
eggplant is used then pour the remaining marinade over the whole dish.

Cover, then turn upside down to mix in the marinade.  Let this
stand for 2 hours at room temperature.  (It will hold for 2 days at
room temperature or up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.)

Unmold onto a serving plate and serve at room temperature.
