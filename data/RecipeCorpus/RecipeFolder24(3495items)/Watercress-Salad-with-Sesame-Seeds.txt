Title: Watercress Salad with Sesame Seeds
Categories: Salad, Japanese
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Sugar
1 tb Roasted sesame seeds
-(crushed)
2 bn Fresh watercress
1 1/2 tb Rice vinegar
2 tb Soy sauce
Trim away about 1-1/2 inches of the coarser watercress stems.  Wash
watercress.

Bring 4 cups of water to a boil.  Add the watercress.  Boil on medium
heat for about 5 minutes or until watercress is just tender.  Drain
in a colander and run cold water over the watercress to fix the
bright-green color.  Drain, squeezing out as much water as possible.

Separate watercress sprigs so they are not in a tight wad and place
in a bowl.  Mix the vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, and sesame seeds in a
small cup. Pour the dressing over the watercress salad and place a
mound each in the center of four small Oriental bowls or small
plates. Serve cold or at room temperature.
