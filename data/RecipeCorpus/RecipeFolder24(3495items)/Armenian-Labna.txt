Shape labna into walnut-sized balls.  Roll in a mixture of chopped
fresh herbs: dill, mint, chives - whatever herbs are available.
Drizzle a little olive oil over.  These little cheeses can be
preserved in olive oil. Place the balls on a plate and place in the
refrigerator for a few hours to firm. Place in a sterilised jar. Add
dried herbs of your choice. Cover with a good quality olive oil.
These cheeses can be stored at room temperature but it is advisable
to refrigerate before using. Helen Gray. Bon-Appetit, Exec.Chef.
