Veal: =====

Lightly flour the veal slices.

In a saute pan, warm the oil then saute the veal for 1 minute on
each side.

Drain off the oil and add wine to the pan (do not cover the veal
with the wine).  Bring the liquid to a boil, then lower the heat and
add chicken broth, brown gravy, and mustard sauce.  Add 1 teaspoon of
chopped parsley and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.

Remove the veal slices from the pan and arrange them onto a
serving dish.

If your sauce is too thick, add a little broth; if it's too
thin, add some cream.  Heat the sauce well and pour it liberally over
the veal.

Garnish the dish with chopped parsley.
