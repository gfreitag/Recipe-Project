Title: Poached Pears with Pepper
Categories: Dessert, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
1/3 c  Sugar
2 ts Black or white peppercorns
1/2 pt Whipping cream
6 sm Firm-ripe pears; abt. 2 lbs.
-- preferably Comice or
-- Anjou
750 ml Bottle dry red wine
Pare the pears, leaving stems intact.  With paring knife or vegetable
peeler, remove as much of the cores as possible from the blossom ends.

Place wine and sugar in a non-corrodible pan just large enough to
hold the pears.  Cook, stirring occasionally, over high heat until
sugar is just dissolved.  Reduce heat to medium and add pears and
peppercorns.

Simmer pears, turning them occasionally, until they are tender, about
25 minutes.  Remove from heat and let them cool to room temperature,
then transfer the pears to a serving dish.  Strain poaching liquid
and boil until it is reduced by half.  Cool to room temperature.

Whip the cream to soft peaks, with a little sugar if desired.  Chill
the cream for a few minutes or as long as 2 hours.  Pour poaching
liquid over pears and serve the whipped cream on the side.
