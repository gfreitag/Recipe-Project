Queen Ida writes, "A moist and spicy holiday dressing" is how my
daughter, Ledra, describes this piquant dish as prepared by my
daughter-in-law. The dressing is fully cooked, and needs only a few
minutes in the oven or microwave to reheat.  Despite the modern
shortcut (a muffin mix), it takes a little time to prepare, but the
giblets and broth can be cooked a day early, cooled, and refrigerated
until the next morning. Ingredients may be halved to serve 6 as a
dressing to accompany roast chicken or duck."

===========DIRECTIONS===================================== 1. Place
giblets, the water, celery halves, carrot, quartered onion, and salt
in a large, deep saucepan.  Bring just to a boil, skim until foam (if
any) subsides, reduce heat, and boil slowly until giblets are tender
(about 1 hour).  Drain, reserving solids and liquids separately. Chop
giblets or pulse in a food processor.

2.  While broth cooks (if you are making the dressing all in one day),
prepare corn muffin mix according to package directions and bake in a
cake pan until golden brown.  Let cool; crumble into small pieces.

3.  Meanwhile, chop the vegetables and mix the garlic and seasonings;
reserve.

4.  In a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown the sausage.  Drain off
the fat and add the butter, vegetables, and seasonings.  Cook,
stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat, until vegetables wilt.
Add reserved giblet broth and giblets and bring to a simmer.  Simmer
about 20 minutes. Stir in crumbled corn bread.  Stir in additional
chicken broth a small amount at a time, folding together well, until
mixture is moist but not soggy.  Taste carefully and correct
seasonings. Dressing should be spicy to your palate.  Pack mixture
into an ovenproof or microwaveable pan, and reserve while preparing
the remainder of the meal.

5.  Reheat shortly before serving.
