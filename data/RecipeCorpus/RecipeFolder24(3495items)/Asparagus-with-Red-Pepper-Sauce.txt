Title: Asparagus with Red Pepper Sauce
Categories: Diabetic, Side dish, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
(you might want to try
Rice vingegar)
1/2 ts Fresh Thyme Leaves
Salt & Pepper
1 lb Asparagus Stalks;
3 lg Large Red Peppers
3 1/2 tb Olive Oil
1 tb Balsamic Vinegar
Peel the asparagus if necessary and cook the stalks in lightly salted
water for 4 to 8 minutes, depending on thickness, or until fork
tender but stiil firm. Drain under cold water and set the stalks
aside. Broil the peppers on all sides until lightly scorched. Place
the cooked peppers in a paper bag for 10 minutes. Remove the peppers
and peel off the skin. Cut open the peppers and remove the stem,
seeds and white flesh. Puree the peppers in the food processor. Mix
in the olive oil, Balsamic Vinegar and thyme. Taste for seasoning and
add salt and pepper if desired. Place equal amount of the puree on 4
serving dishes. Top with equal amounts of asparagus. Food Exchange
per serving: 1 VEGETABLE EXCHANGE + 1 FAT EXCHANGE (I would cut back
even more on the fat, only using what is neccesary...)
