1) Mix spices in a small bowl. 2) Combine 1 cup of chopped onion, 1
cup finely chopped eggplant, 1 cup of okra (I put in a food processor
and pulse to chop finely) 3) Heat non-stick skillet or pot over high
heat about 4 minutes. Add chopped vegetables, bell pepper and
seasoning mix, stir and cook for about 5 minutes. Vegetables should
stick to bottom of pan, then you unstick and stir them so that they
carmelize (brown) a little but don't burn. 4) Stir in 1 cup of apple
juice, stir to unstick from bottom, add 1 cup of tomatoes.  Cook,
stirring occasionally until most of liquid evaporates, about 20
minutes. 5) Add remaining onions, okra, eggplant and tomatoes (tomato
sauce if used). Scrape to clear bottom and cook 10 minutes or more
until eggplant is cooked.

Notes --- This is from Paul Prudhomme's Fork in the Road.  I used to
be warry of okra, but in Oklahoma in the heat of August it's about
the only vegetable that still grows (even the tomatoes stop setting
fruit when it gets too hot).  I also used frozen okra.  I like the
okra in this recipe. When well cooked, the gumminess goes away and
its serves as a thickener to the dish.  If you're warry of okra, you
might want to reduce the total amount to 1 cup and let the eggplant
and tomotoes dominate. Prudhomme always uses onion powder and garlic
powder in his spice mixes, which I used to think was redundant when
using real onions, but it actually imparts a different flavor. He
places great emphasis on cooking the vegetables a long time in a
non-stick skillet and letting them brown a little to carmelize and
develop the flavors, and it does pay to be patient.  The original
recipe had a total of 2 1/2 cups of apple juice, but that seemed like
too much to me and I already had plenty of liquid from the canned
tomatoes.
