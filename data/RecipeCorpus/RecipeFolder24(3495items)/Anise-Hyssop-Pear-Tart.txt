Title: Anise Hyssop Pear Tart
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Dessert
Yield: 1 tart
3 oz Cold cream cheese
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/3 c  Sugar
1 1/2 tb Cornstarch
2    Egg yolks
Pernod liqueur*; to taste
1    To 1 1/2 c. coarsely chopped
-- anise hyssop leaves and
-- flowers
2 c  Half-and-half
3 lg Ripe Bartlett pears; pared
-- halved and cored
1/2 c  Cold butter or margarine
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
-- flower stalks
3    Or 4 fresh anise hyssop
*Optional.

In a saucepan, combine chopped anise hyssop leaves and flowers and
half-and-half.  Slowly bring to a simmer.  Remove from heat and allow
anise hyssop to steep for 2 to 3 hours.

With a knife, decoratively score round sides of pears.  Lay pears,
flat side down, in a buttered 9x13" pan.

Cut butter and cream cheese into cubes.  Combine in a food processor
with flour.  Whirl until mixture holds together.  Press this dough
evenly over bottom and sides of an 11" tart pan with removable bottom.

In a 375 F. oven, set pastry on a low rack and pears on a rack above.
Bake until crust is golden and pears turn brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
Cool.

Strain and discard the leaves from the half-and-half.  In a saucepan,
mix sugar and cornstarch, then stir in the cooled half-and-half. Stir
over medium-high heat until boiling.  Stir some of the cream into the
egg yolks, then add the yolks and cream back to the pan and stir 1
minute. Stir in Pernod if desired.  Pour hot anise hyssop cream into
crust. Set pears, round side up, in cream.  Let cool, cover lightly,
and chill 8 hours or overnight.

Before serving, scatter anise hyssop florets between the pears and
place a small leaf cluster in the center of the tart.

Yield: 6 to 12 servings.
