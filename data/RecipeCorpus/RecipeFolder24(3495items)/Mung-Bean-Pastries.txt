Title: Mung Bean Pastries
Categories: Thai, Dessert, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 dozen
3/4 c  Coconut milk
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Yellow mung beans, optional
1/2 c  Mung bean flour
3/4 c  Sugar
2 dr Red or green food colouring
1/4 c  Rice flour
In a large bowl, combine the mung bean flour, sugar, food colouring &
2 c cold water.  Stir until the flour is almost dissolved.  Strain
through cheesecloth into a pot.  Over medium heat, stir the liquid
until all remaining solids are completely dissolved & the mixture is
thick & sticky enough to coat a spoon.  Cool for 15 minutes.

Cover a baking sheet with waxed paper.  Drop the mixture by the
spoonful onto the sheet.  Do not allow the circles to touch.  Let
cool to room temperature.

In a large bowl, combine the rice flour, milk & salt, stirring until
dissolved.  Strain into a pot & cook over medium heat for 10 minutes.
Drop 1 ts of this onto the cooling gelatin circles.

In a dry skillet, toast the yellow mung beans until they turn light
brown. Generously sprinkle onto the pastries & refrigerate for 1 hour
before serving.  They will keep in the refrigerator for 2 or 3 days.
