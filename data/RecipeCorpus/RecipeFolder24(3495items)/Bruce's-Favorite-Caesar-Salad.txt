Title: Bruce's Favorite Caesar Salad
Categories: Salad, Appetizer
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Worcestershire Sauce
3/4 c  Olive Oil
Red Wine Vinegar
1 x  Lemon
Fresh Grated Parmesan Cheese
Croutons
1/2 lb Bacon
1 x  Head of Romaine Lettuce
1 x  Tin of Anchovy Filets
1 tb Fresh Ground Black Pepper
4 cl Garlic
1 x  Egg Yolk-use Extra Large Egg
1 tb Prepared Hot Mustard
3 ds Tobasco Sauce
1) Cook the bacon until very crisp. Set aside and allow to drain on
paper
towels.

2) Place egg in a glass of warm water and set aside until it reaches
room
temperature (10-15 minutes).

3) Crush the garlic in a large wooden bowl. Add the anchovies and
crush
into a pulpy mass. Mix with black pepper.

4) Add mustard, worcestershire sauce and tobasco. Separate the egg,
keeping
the yolk. If you can't find any extra large eggs then 2 small eggs
is
fine. Stir in each of these ingredients thoroughly as you add each
one.

5) SLOWLY add the oil from the anchovy tin, using a french whisk to
mix.

6) SLOWLY add olive oil, rapidly whipping until you get a thick
paste. You
may have to vary the amount of oil to achieve this (at least 3/4
cup).

7) Squeeze in some red wine vinegar to taste. Once around the bowl is
usually enough.

8) Squeeze in one lemon for the juice, again to taste.

9) Just before serving, add the lettuce, croutons, crushed bacon and
parmesan cheese. Toss Thoroughly.

The trick to this is the dressing should be quite thick before adding
the red wine vinegar and lemon juice.

You may want to add more garlic, tobasco, worcestershire, mustard
depending on how spicy you like your Caesar Salad. From the kitchen
