Because the number of ingredients and directions lines exceeds
the limits of this Meal Master program, I've taken the liberty of
splitting up this recipe into three parts.  Please capture all three
parts before attempting to cook this recipe or you'll find yourself
in a quandary at some point!  ;-) :

Progres with Grand Marnier I (Biscuit)
Progres with Grand Marnier II (Buttercream)
Progres with Grand Marnier III (Mousse)
Progres with Grand Marnier IV (Assembly)
