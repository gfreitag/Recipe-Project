Shatta, like zhoug, should be put in a jar and placed in the
refrigerator, for use in many recipes.  It also will keep for many
months.

The author writes: "Shatta...is less powerful than zhoug.  Its bright
red color adds a rich hue to sauces and salads and enhances its
delicious taste.  Shatta is a pleasure."
