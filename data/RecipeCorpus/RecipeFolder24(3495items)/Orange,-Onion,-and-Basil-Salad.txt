Title: Orange, Onion, and Basil Salad
Categories: Fruit, Salad
Yield: 6 servings
Freshly ground pepper
2    Rounded tb. pine nuts
2    To 3 cups fresh basil leaves
-- unblemished
Salt
3 lg Or 4 small navel oranges
2 lg Or 3 small red onions
-- sliced 1/8" thick
1 sm Turnip; julienned*
7 1/2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
2 tb Balsamic vinegar
*Franklin Adams occasionally juliennes a small turnip and adds it to
this salad.  He says the flavor provides a nice surprise; the pink
and white of the turnip a good color note.

Grate the zest from one of the oranges and place it in the bottom of
a wide salad bowl.  Without peeling, slice all the oranges about 1/4
to 3/8 inch thick.  Squeeze the juice from the end slices into the
bowl over the zest. Remove any seeds, then remove the peel from each
slice by laying it flat and turning it as you take a series of
straight downward cuts, leaving no white pulp.  Place the peeled
slices in the bowl. Separate the onion slices into rings and add to
the bowl.

In a small bowl, whisk together 7 tb. of the olive oil, the vinegar,
and some pepper.  Pour this vinaigrette over the onion and orange
slices. Toss gently, being careful not to break up the orange slices,
until the oranges and onions are coated.  Marinate for 30 minutes to
1 hour.

Heat the remaining 1/2 tb. of oil in a skillet; brown the pine nuts
over medium heat until they are medium tan - don't allow them to
blacken.

Wash and dry the basil.  Chop the leaves if they are large; leave them
whole if they are small.  Just before serving, add the basil and pine
nuts to the salad bowl, toss gently, and serve.  Salt to taste.
