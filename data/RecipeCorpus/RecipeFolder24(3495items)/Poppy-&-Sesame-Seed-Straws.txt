Title: Poppy & Sesame Seed Straws
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 60 servings
2 tb Olive oil
1/4 ts Salt
6    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18"
2 tb Poppy seeds
2 tb Sesame seeds
1 lg Egg white
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly coat 2 baking sheets with
nonstick cooking spray or line with parchment paper. Heat a small
heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the poppy and sesame seeds and
cook, stirring until they are aromatic and toasted, 2 to 3 minutes.
Turn out onto a plate to cool. In a small bowl, whisk together egg
white, oil and salt.
Lay a sheet of phyllo on a work surface with a short side toward
you. With a pastry brush, lightly coat the lower half of the sheet
with the egg-white mixture and sprinkle with 1 tsp. seeds. Fold the
upper half over to cover the lower half. Brush the right half of the
folded sheet with egg-white mixture, sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. seeds and
fold the left half over the seeds. Brush the bottom half of the
folded sheet with the egg-white mixture, sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. seeds
and fold the upper half over. Finally, brush the top with the
egg-white mixture and sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. seeds. Cut into 10 short
strips using a knife or serrated pastry cutter. With a wide spatula,
transfer the strips to the baking sheet, placing them about 1/2 inch
apart. Repeat the procedure with the remaining 5 sheets of phyllo,
egg-white mixture and seeds. Bake the straws for 8 to 10 minutes,
until golden and crisp. Transfer to a rack to cool.
The straws may be stored in an airtight container at room
temperature for 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 months.
Makes about 5 dozen straws.
