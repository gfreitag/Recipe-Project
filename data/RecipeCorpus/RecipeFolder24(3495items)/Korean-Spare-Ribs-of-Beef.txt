1 t  Finely grated fresh ginger
1 T  Sugar
1/2 t  Ground black pepper
2 T  Toasted crushed sesame seeds
2 T  Medium dry sherry
2 kg Beef short ribs
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1/2 c  Water
4 T  Finely chopped spring onions
2 t  Finely grated garlic
The short ribs should be cut into 8 cm lengths.  Cut them with a saw
if the butcher has not already done so.  Slash meat nearly to bone to
allow marinade to penetrate. Combine all other ingredients in a large
bowl, add ribs, mix well and allow to marinate in refrigerator, at
least overnight; twenty-four hours is better. Prepare barbecue well
ahead so that coals have enough time to become glowing. Put meat on
grill with bone side downwards and cook until brown. Turn and cook
other side until well done. Turn pieces frequently so that all are
brown and crisp.  Fedor Mediansky Bon-Appetit, Exec.Chef. Magnus
