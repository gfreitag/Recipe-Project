arranged on top of several different kinds of lettuce. Celery sticks

of Garden Turkey and Rice Salad features wheat germ and cooked brown
rice, crunchy vegetables and lean turkey breast. Freshly squeezed

white. Dip chicken into egg white mixture and then into wheat germ
mixture, coating chicken thoroughly. Place on broiler rack sprayed
with no stick cooking spray. Broil 3 minutes; turn. Broil an
additional 24 minutes or until juices run clear. Slice into strips
and serve over mixed greens with celery sticks and salad dressing.
