Categories: Bread, Diabetic, Fruit, Nuts/grains, Muffin
Yield: 10 lg muffins
MMMMM-----------------------FRUIT AND NUTS----------------------------
1 2/3 c  Pineapple (crush/drain)
1/2 c  Pecans
1 c  Pealed and diced apples
MMMMM----------------------WET INGREDIENTS---------------------------
2    Eggs
1 t  Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Oil
14 T  Fruit sweetener
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1 t  Cinnamon
1/2 t  Nutmeg
1/2 t  Salt
2 3/4 c  Unbleached white flour
1 t  Baking powder
1 t  Baking soda
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly spray regular size or mini
muffin tins with lecithin spray. Toast the pecans in the oven for
7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool, then
coarsely chop the nuts with a knife or with a pulsing action in a
food processor. Drain the crushed pineapple, reserving the juice for
another use. Whisk together the wet ingredients in the order listed
until well blended. Sift together the dry ingredients into a large
bowl. Make a well in the center and stir in the wet mix. When half
mixed, stir in the diced apples, drained pineapple and toasted
pecans. Do not overmix, the batter should remain lumpy. Use a rounded
#12 (1/2 cup) scoop to place the batter into regular size muffin tims
or use a #24 (2-3 tablespoons) scoop for the mini muffin tins. Bake
either sized muffins on the middle shelf of the preheated oven. Bake
regular sized muffins for 25-30 minutes, and mini muffins for 15-20
minutes. Turn the muffin tins once, if necessary, for the muffins to
brown evenly. Let the muffins cool in the pan for 5 minutes before
removing them to a wire rack to cool completely.
