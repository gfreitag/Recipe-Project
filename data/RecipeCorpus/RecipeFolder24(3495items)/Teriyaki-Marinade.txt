Teriyaki could be called the national marinade of Japan.  It goes
equally well with seafood, poultry and meat.  Mirin is sweetened rice
wine. It's available at Asian markets and health food stores.  If
unavailable, use sake, sherry or white wine and increase the sugar.
The maple syrup adds a New Age touch.

Peel and mince ginger and garlic.  Finely chop green onions.  Place
ginger, garlic and green onions in bowl and stir in soy sauce, mirin,
sesame oil and maple syrup. Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 to 2
pounds lamb, chicken or shrimp. From: Sherree Johansson Date: 24 Apr
