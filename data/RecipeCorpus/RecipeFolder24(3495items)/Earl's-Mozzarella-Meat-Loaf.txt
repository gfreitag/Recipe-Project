Categories: Diabetic, Meat, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 8 servings
2    Egg whites
4 oz Part-skim mozarella cheese
-cut in 1/4-inch cubes
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
2 T  Parsley; chopped
3/4 ts Salt; optional
1/8 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Catsup
1 lg Onion; coarsely chopped
1 T  Olive oil
1    Sweet red pepper; chopped
1 cl Garlic; finely chopped
1 ts Leaf basil; crumbled
1/2 ts Lef thyme; crumbled
1 1/2 lb Lean ground beef
1/2 lb Ground pork
1 c  Old-fashioned oats; uncooked
Preheat oven to moderate (375 degrees).  Line jelly-roll pan with
aluminum foil.

Saute onion in oil in large skillet over medium heat 3 minutes.  Add
red pepper, garlic, basil, and thyme, saute 5 minutes.

Combine beef, pork, oats, egg, whites, mozzarella, Parmesan, parsley,
optional salt, and pepper in large bowl.  Add vegetable mixture.
Shape into large oval on prepared pan.

Bake in moderate oven (375 degrees) for 30 minutes.  Brush loaf with
catsup.  Bake 25 minutes or until cooked through.  Let stand 10 minute
before slicing.

Judi's Notes:  I would bake this meat loaf in a loaf pan due to
possible grease escaping from the jelly roll pan.  I would also spoon
off some of the fat from the loaf after 30 minutes.
