heat until hot. Add the garlic, ginger and pork. Stir-fry 2 minutes.
Add the cooking wine and shrimp and stir-fry 2 minutes. Add the
mushrooms and remaining vegetables and stir-fry 2 minutes. Add the
sesame seed oil and salt to taste. Mix. Drain off excess liquid and
set the vegetable mixture aside. In a clean wok, heat 5 cups
vegetable oil to the boiling point, about 400 F. Working with one at
a time, lay the egg roll wrappers on the counter and place 1/8 of the
reserved vegetable mixture on one end of each. Moisten the edges of
the wrapper w/ the egg white and roll the wrapper, tucking in the
ends at both sides of wrapper as you roll. Deep-fry the egg roll
about 5 to 10 min. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels.
