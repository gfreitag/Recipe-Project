Ellen and Dick Brennan say, in their book The Commanders Palace New
Orleans Cookbook, "Commanders is famous for its turtle soup, which is
considered a great delicacy.  Years ago we used to have soft-shelled
turtle stew, but that animal is now an endangered species.  We now
use loggerhead and snapper turtles from our own bayou waters, which
are more abundant. This soup is dark, thick, rich--a stew-type dish,
filling enough to make a whole meal itself."
