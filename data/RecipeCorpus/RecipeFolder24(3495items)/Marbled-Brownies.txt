(From "San Francisco Encore," by the Junior League of San Francisco.)

Butter a 9" square pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder and
salt. Set aside. Melt the chocolate with the butter. Remove from heat
and let cool slightly. Beat the 2 eggs until foamy. Add the 3/4 cup
sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Continue beating until light
lemon-colored. Beat in the chocolate mixture and then the dry
ingredients. Mix well. Set aside 3/4 cup of the mixture. To the
remainder, stir in 1/2 cup of the nuts. Spread this mixture into the
prepared pan.

Preheat oven to 350'F. Beat the cream cheese with the butter until
smooth. Add the 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 cup sugar and beat until
fluffy. Beat in the 1 egg. Spread cheese mixture over the chocolate
layer. Place heaping tablespoons of the reserved 3/4 cup chocolate
mixture over the cheese, forming 8 or 9 mounds. With a small spatula
of knife, cut through the mounds in a zigzag layer, going almost but
not quite through the bottom. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup
nuts. Bake for 35 minutes. Let stand at room temperature for a few
hours before cutting.

Makes 24 brownies.
