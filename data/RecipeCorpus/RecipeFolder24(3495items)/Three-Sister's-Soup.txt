"We still grow squash, beans and corn together in the garden", said
Bertha Skye, "just as the Iroguois, who called them the three sister,
did years ago." This fall harvest soup has become chef Skye's
signature soup since it won her a gold medal at the 1992 Culinary
Olympics in Frankfurt. 2 cups corn kernels 2 cups chopped green beans
2 cups cubed butternut squash 1-1/2 cups diced potatoes 2 tbsp all
purpose flour 2 tbsp butter, softened 3/4 tsp salt 1/2 tsp pepper

In large pot, combine corn, green beans, squash, potatoes and 5 cups
waters.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat; simmer, covered, for about 10
minutes, or until vegetables are almost tender.  Blend together flour
and butter.  Stir into soup.  Increase heat to medium.  Cook for 5
minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in salt and pepper.  Makes 4-6
servings. Origin: Canadian Living, October 1994. Shared by: Sharon
Stevens, Sept/94.
