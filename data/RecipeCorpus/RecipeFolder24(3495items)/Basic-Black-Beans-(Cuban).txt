Categories: Caribbean, Beans, Main dish, Vegetable

3 tb Minced garlic
1/4 c  Olive oil
3 tb Cider vinegar
1/4 c  Sherry wine
Salt; to taste
14 oz Dried black beans
2 qt ;Water
1/8 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Ground oregano
2 ts Ground cumin
1    Green pepper; quartered
Rinse beans and discard any stones. In a large pot, soak beans
overnight in water with baking soda, oregano, cumin and green pepper.

The next day, add onion, garlic, olive oil, cider vinegar, sherry and
salt to the water and cook on medium-low heat for about 3 hours or
until the beans are very tender and liquid is reduced and somewhat
thickened. Make sure liquid in pot does not entirely boil away.  To
prevent beans from burning, add more water when necessary.

Recipe from Sandy Vasquez of Honduras and Miami, FL, who got the
recipe from her Cuban grandmother. Tried on 09/01/90 when Sandy
taught a Cuban cooking class at The Cookbook Cottage/1279 Bardstown
Rd./Louisville, KY 40204. Posted by Cathy Harned.
