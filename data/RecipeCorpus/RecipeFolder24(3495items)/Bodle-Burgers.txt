Title: Bodle Burgers
Categories: Seafood, Bbq/grill, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1/8 t  Cayenne
1/4 t  Thyme
1 lb Fresh squid (Reserve
-Liquor)*
1/4 lb Tofu
*The squid we get here is already cleaned, cut up and packed in
water. If you use fresh squid there will not be any liquor. The
moisture from the tofu will hold it together. Put squid in a blender
a little at a time. Chop up real fine. Add enough liquor to keep
moist; but not wet and add tofu a little at a time until well
blended. Form into 1/4 pound patties. Baste with your favorite bbq
sauce as you cook them on you bbq. About 2 minutes on each side
should be enough. Serves 4.
