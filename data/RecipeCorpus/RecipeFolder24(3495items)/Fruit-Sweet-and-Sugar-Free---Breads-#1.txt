Yield: 1 servings  Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free by Janice Feuer 1993 Royal Teton Ranch

There is so much joy in making bread. If the promise of having that
wonderful and all pervading aroma of fresh baked bread throughout your
kitchen is not enough reason to get you started, then consider the
unrivaled experience of feeling the alive and vibrant dough in your
hands, and the expectancy and comfort of that first soft bite of
fresh baked bread still hot from the oven.

Yeasted: ******** All of these yeast bread recipes have been
perfected at the Ranch Kitchen Bakery, and many of them have been
blue ribbon winners at the local Park County or Montana State fairs.
As The Ranch Kitchen is nestled in the Gallatin Mountain Range at
over 5,000 feet in elevation, all of our yeast doughs rise very
quickly. Therefore I suggest giving the dough a second rising before
forming it into loaves or rolls. You may or may not choose to do
this, though a second rising at any elevation helps produce a fine
textured bread with a more developed flavour.

The yield is given in both the size and number of loaves or rolls and
in pounds. When a number of loaves or rolls is given, they are for
1-1/2 pound loaves baked in standard 4"x8" loaf pans, and for 2 ounce
to 3 ounce rolls.

Bread making is easy to master once you know a bit about the principal
ingredients and the techniques for working with them. I have included
tips for making yeasted breads by hand as well as by machine. If you
choose the efficiency of kneading your dough in an electric mixer
with a dough hook, you will still have the pleasure of having your
hands on the dough when you punch it down after it has risen and when
you form your loaves. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   09-30-94
