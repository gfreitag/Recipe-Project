Title: Watermelon Salsa
Categories: Misc/food
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Balsamic Vinegar
1    Red Onion
1    Watermelon
1 bn Cilantro
Halve the watermelon, scoop out meat.  Seed (this took forever!) cut
up into presentable pieces, not too big.  Save one of the halves to
serve the salsa in.  Reserve some of the watermelon juice. Chop
cilantro (watch out for stems!) Chop onion.  Amounts will depend on
size of the watermelon. I used a fairly small melon and used about
1/2 bunch of cilantro, one red onion, and a cup each of watermelon
juice and balsamic vinegar. I also added some jicama for some extra
crunch.

Mix everthing gently in a large bowl or container, chill, serve in
watermelon shell, if you like.  It's not complicated, just tedious,
but worth it!!  Serve as side dish or salad. This does not keep too
well, it gets slimey in a day or two.
