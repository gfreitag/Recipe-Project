I have been told that this dish is almost the national dish of the
Philippines. In addition to pork, Adobo can be made from chicken,
though the procedure is slightly different. The dish can also be
enhanced with the addition of (about 1/4 c) fish sauce in the cooking
process, and with deep-fried dried shrimp used as a garnish. The
shrimp and fish sauce can be purchased in Oriental food stores. Also,
the combined ingredients (minus the garnish) can be marinated for a
couple hours, and the cooking time can be reduced to as little as
half an hour, depending upon the cut of pork used. The following
method is my preference:

Place pork (shoulder) in saucepan. Add vinegar, soy sauce, garlic
(pound bulb lightly to loosen individual cloves), bay leaves, pepper,
a pinch of salt, and the water. Cover saucepan, bring to boil, then
simmer for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the meat is tender.
Strain cooking broth into another saucepan and reduce liquid to about
a quarter of a cup, more or less to taste.
Separate the garlic from the meat, and peel the cloves. Fry them
gently in the lard til brown. Add the pork and fry until brown. Add
the reduced broth and let the adobo simmer over low heat for about
five minutes.
Serve hot with a good oriental rice.
