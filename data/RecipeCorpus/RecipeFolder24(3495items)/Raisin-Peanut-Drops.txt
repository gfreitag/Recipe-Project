Title: Raisin Peanut Drops
Categories: Candy, Chocolate
Yield: 36 pieces
Roasted Peanuts
1 c  Miniature Marshmallows
2    8 oz Milk Chocolate Bars
1 c  Raisins
1 c  Chopped, unsalted dry
Cover a large cookie sheet with wax paper or aluminum foil; set aside.

Break up candy bars and place in a 2-quart measure or casserole.
Microwave on high 1 minute; stir. Microwave on high 1 to 2 minutes,
or just until most chocolate pieces melt. Stir until all chocolate
melts and is smooth.

Stir in raisins, peanuts and marshmallows.  Drop by teaspoonfuls onto
covered cookie sheet.  Let cool until firm. Store in an airtight
container. Makes 36 candies.

Note:  I had to put these into the frig for about 15 minutes to
really firm up.  They are delicious.
