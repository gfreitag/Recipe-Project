-the water for gravy)
2-3 cubes (or envelopes,
-or tsp) bouillon (chicken
-for chicken gravy,
Beef for beef gravy)
3-4 tbsp dried onion flakes
ds Of cayenne
ds Of garlic powder
2-3 tbsp cornstarch
Cold water
You can end up with perfect
-gravy every time even if
-you don't have any
Pan drippings to start
-with.  Simply use beef or
-chicken bouillion in
Place of the drippings.
-Though.. drippings as a
-starter seems to make a
More full bodied gravy.
2-3 cups pan drippings
1-2 cups boiled potato
-water (don't drain off
After removing roast (turkey, chicken, beef or pork) from pan, put pan
directly over burner.  Add potato water and scrape sides of roasting
pan until all 'drippings' have been scraped off and dissolved in
liquid. Bring to a boil, add the onion flakes, bouillon, cayenne and
garlic. Allow to boil while mixing up the cornstarch and cold water.
With a wire whisk, while liquid is at a fast boil, slowly drizzle a
little of the cornstarch mixture into pan.  Quickly stir until
thickened.  If needed, add more cornstarch mixture until you get the
gravy to the consistency you desire. This is the easiest way I have
found for making gravy.  I not only use this for roasts, I also use
this as a sauce for my stir fried vegetables to create a 'chop suey'
type of dish. Origin: Sharon Stevens Shared by: Sharon Stevens,
