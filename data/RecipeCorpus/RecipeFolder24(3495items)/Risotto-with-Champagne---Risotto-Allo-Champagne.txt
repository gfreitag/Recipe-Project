Whoever created this outstanding dish deserves a toast, with
champagne of course.

Prepare chicken broth.  Heat broth in a medium saucepan.  Melt 1/4 cup
butter in a large saucepan.  When butter foams, add onion.  Saute over
medium heat until pale yellow.  Add rice and mix well.  When rice is
coated with butter, add 1 or 2 ladles of broth, or enough to cover
rice. Stir over medium heat until broth has been absorbed. Continue
cooking and stirring rice, adding broth a little at a time over about
10 minutes. During remaining 10 minutes of cooking, add champagne, 1
cup at a time (instead of adding broth).  Do not add more champagne
until previous amount has been absorbed.  Rice is done whien it is
tender but firm to the bite. Stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and
remaining butter. Season with salt. Place in a warm dish.  Serve
immediately with remaining Parmesan cheese.

Makes 6 servings.
