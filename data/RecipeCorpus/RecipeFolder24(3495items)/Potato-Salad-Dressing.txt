Title: Potato Salad Dressing
Categories: Dressing, Salad
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 t  Mild vinegar (I use rice
Vinegar)
1 t  Gourmet mustard of your
Choice
2 ds Garlic powder
2 c  Fatfree Ranch Salad
Dressing
2 T  Reduced Fat Mayonnaise*
1 t  Superfine sugar
1 t  Celery seed
* I use reduced fat mayonnaise instead of fatfree because I think the
fatfree is totally tasteless and why bother.  I make this very
rarely, so I justify the use of the mayonnaise to myself.

This is better if you make the potato salad ahead of time and let it
sit over night in the fridge so the tastes can marry well.

I hope you enjoy it!
