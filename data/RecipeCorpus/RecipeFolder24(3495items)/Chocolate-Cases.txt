To melt chocolate: break off as much chocolate as you require in small
pieces.  Stand in shallow bowl over pot of boiling water, off the
stove. Cover bowl so steam won't spoil the chocolate as it melts.

To make chocolate cases: spray some paper sweet cases with vegetable
oil and using one teaspoon of melted chocolate for each case, run
teaspoon around twice to coat each case thoroughly.  These chocolate
cases will store up to one month in an air-tight container in the
refrigerator.

To make mousse filling: melt chocolate with water and sugar in a
double boiler, stirring until creamy.  Cool a little and stir in cut
butter and Cointreau.  When thoroughly mixed, stir in beaten egg
yolks. Cook in a double boiler until mixture thickens, then fold into
stiffly beaten egg whites.  When cool, fill chocolate cases. Grate
some dark chocolate by hand with a knife and sprinkle filled cases
with grated chocolate. Store in airtight container until ready to
serve. Pat Hobson. Bon-Appetit, Exec.Chef. Magnus Johansson
