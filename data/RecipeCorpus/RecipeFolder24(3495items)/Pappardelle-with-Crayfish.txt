*Dry vermouth can be used instead of Retsina.

**Preferably Italian pappardelle.

***If you cannot find crayfish where you live, substitute medium
shrimp.

In an enamel pot, reduce Retsina over medium heat to about 1/3 cup.
Add the cream, shallots, cayenne, thyme, tomato paste and orange
zest; combine, then reduce again by one-third.  Set aside.

Seed and vein the peppers.  Cut lengthwise into 1/2" slices and steam
until barely tender, about 3 or 4 minutes.  Set aside.

In a very large pot, bring 6 to 8 quarts of salted water to a boil.
Add the pasta and cook until al dente, 9 to 12 minutes.  While the
pasta is cooking, heat the sauce over low heat and stir in the
crayfish tails. Cook until the crayfish is warmed through.  When the
pasta is done, drain it and transfer to a large serving bowl.  Stir
in the butter, the crayfish sauce, and a generous grinding of black
pepper. Garnish with basil leaves, lemon slices, and whole crayfish.
