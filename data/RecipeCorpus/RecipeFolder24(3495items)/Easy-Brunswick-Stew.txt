Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings

-MM BY H PEAGRAM
1 lb Ground beef
1 md Onion, chopped
2 cn Tomatoes, diced
2 cn Cream-style corn
1    10-oz  can barbecued pork
2 cn Boned chicken
Brown ground beef with onions, stirring to break up clumps. When meat
is no longer pink and onion is transparent, drain and mix with
remaining ingredients in a Crock-pot. Cook for 6 hours on low. Serve
hot with fresh hot bread (we like cornbread), barbecued pork or
chicken, or both. This freezes well and keeps for several days in the
refrigerator.

Note:  this recipe does not do well on stovetop; it burns easily on
even the lowest heat setting on my stove. If you don't want to use the
Crock-pot, try a slow oven or a microwave on a low power setting.
