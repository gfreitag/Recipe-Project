Title: Burro E Parmigiano
Categories: Italian, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 6 servings
8 T  Grated Parmesan cheese
8 T  Unsalted butter
1/2 c  All-purpose cream
Put the butter and cream in a wide, shallow serving bowl or deep
platter in a warm (200 degree) oven.  When the butter has melted,
stir in about 2/3 of the cheese.  Keep this cream sauce warm while
waiting to add pasta or gnocchi.  After the addition, turn over the
mixture until the sauce is well distributed and sprinkle with
remaining cheese. From The Romagnolis' Table by Margaret & G. Franco
