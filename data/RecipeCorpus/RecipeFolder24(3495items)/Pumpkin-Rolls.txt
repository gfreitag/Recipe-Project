1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
3/4 ts Cloves
3/4 ts Nutmeg
3/4 ts Ginger
2 1/2 c  To 3 cups all purpose flour
1 1/2 c  To 2 cups whole wheat flour

1.  In a large bowl or food processor, dissolve yeast in water.  Add
honey, margarine, salt, dry milk, pumpkin, spices.  Beat well to
blend, then gradually beat in about 4 cups of the combined flours to
make a stiff dough.

2.  Turn dough out onto a floured board and knead until smooth about
15 to 20 min, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking.

3.  Turn dough over in a bowl coated with nonstick spray, cover and
let rise in a warm place until doubled (1 1/2 - 2 hours)  Punch down
dough, knead briefly on a lightly floured board to release air.

4.  Divide dough into 24 equal pieces.  Shape each into a smooth ball
and place balls in 2 greased 9-inch round baking pans coated with
nonstick spray.  Cover and let rise until almost double.

5.  Bake in a preheated 375 F oven for 25 minutes or until browned.
Cool on racks.
