Beef stew
Use a pumpkin large enough to hold beef stew.  Cut top of pumpkin
like you would if you were going to carve it.  Take out all the seeds
and goop from the inside.  When beef stew is cooked, put it in the
pumpkin, put the lid on the pumpkin, and put it in a 350 degree oven
for 1 hour. When serving from the pumpkin scrape some of the pumpkin
flesh for each bowl. Submitted By JEANNE GEAKE   On   10-17-94
