Categories: African, Soup/stew, Meat
Yield: 4 servings
2 ts Minced fresh turmeric
-- or rehydrated turmeric
-or-
1 ts Ground dried turmeric
1 ts Ground cinnamon
3/4 c  Orzo noodles or
1/2 c  Rice
1    To 2 tb. lemon juice
1/8    To 1/4 tsp. salt
1    To 2 tsp. sugar
2 tb Flour
1/2 c  ;Water
1    Egg
1/2 c  Dried chickpeas
-- (garbanzo beans)
-or-
16 oz Can chickpeas
5    To 6 cups water
1/2 lb Boneless lean lamb cubes
1    Or more lamb bones (opt'l.)
4    Chicken legs or thighs
2 c  Chopped fresh tomatoes
-- or same amount canned
1 c  Chopped onions
1/2 c  Chopped celery tops
1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
Rinse and pick over dried chickpeas.  Soak overnight in a large
quantity of water.  The following day, pour off the soaking liquid
and place the chickpeas in a large kettle or stockpot.  (Or boil
chickpeas in water for 2 minutes, then let them soak for 1 hour.) Add
6 cups of water, cover the pot, and simmer about 60 to 90 minutes, or
until tender. If you're using canned chickpeas, drain and rinse them
and put them in the pot with 5 cups of water.

Add the lamb, bones, chicken, vegetables and spices. Cover the pot and
bring the liquid to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer for
about an hour.  Add the noodles or rice and cook 15 to 20 minutes
longer. Add the smaller amounts of lemon juice, sugar and salt, then
taste for seasoning and add more as needed.  Whip the flour and 1/2
cup water together until any lumps are dispersed, and stir the
mixture into the soup. Heat to thicken, stirring constantly.  Beat
the egg slightly and stir it in.  Heat just until the egg strands are
cooked and serve immediately.

Carlson writes: "This spicy soup is enjoyed throughout the year in
Morocco, but it is obligatory fare after a day of fasting during
Ramadan."
