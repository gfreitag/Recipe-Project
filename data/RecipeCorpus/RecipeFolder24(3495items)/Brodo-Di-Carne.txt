Title: Brodo Di Carne
Categories: Italian, Meat, Beef, Soup/stew
Yield: 1 batch
1 sm Onion
3    Plum tomatoes *OR*
1/2 T  Tomato paste
2    Soupbones
2    Egg whites (optional)
1 lb Up to ...
1 1/2 lb Beef (brisket or bottom
-round cut)
3 t  Salt
1    Celery stalk with leaves
1    Carrot
Put the beef and all the other ingredients in cold water to cover (3
quarts should be enough; if not, add a bit more).  Bring to a boil
slowly, uncovered, over low heat.   When the liquid first boils,
scoop off any froth that forms, lower the heat to a simmer, cover the
pot, and cook for about 3 hours.  The meat should be tender, the
broth a light, clear brown, and flavorful.  Strain the broth, saving
the meat for future use and throwing out the now overcooked
vegetables and the bones. If the broth is fatty, you may chill it and
then remove the congealed fat, or just take it off immediately with a
spoon or a bulb baster. If you want a really clear broth, beat 2 egg
whites lightly, bring the defatted broth to a boil, and mix in the
egg whites, beating with a wire whisk. Boil until the particles have
been absorbed by the cooked egg whites, or for about 3 minutes. Turn
off the heat, and when the broth has settled, scoop off the now
speckled egg whites with a slotted spoon and pour the broth through a
sieve lined with 2 layers of cheesecloth. From The Romagnolis' Table
by Margaret & G. Franco Romagnoli.
