One exciting dish with the three colours of the Italian flag and three
deliciously different tastes.

Prepare chicken broth.  Heat broth in a medium saucepan.  Melt 3 Tbsp
butter in a large sauce pan.  When butter foams, add onion, saute over
medium heat until pale yellow.  Add rice and mix well.  When rice is
coated with butter, add wine.  Cook, stirring constantly, until wine
has been evaporated.  Stir in 1 or 2 ladles of broth, or enough to
cover rice. Stir over medium heat until broth has been absorbed.
Continue cooking and stirring rice, adding broth a little at a time
over a period of 10 minutes. Divide rice into 3 equal portions.  Put
1 portion of rice into each of 2 small saucepans, and leaving third
portion in original pan. Add parsley and basil to 1 pan, tomato paste
to another pan, and nothing to the third pan. Continue cooking and
stirring rice, adding more broth to each pan when needed.  After 5 to
10 minutes when rice is tender but firm to the bite, add 1 Tbsp
butter and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese to each pan. Mix to blend. Season
with salt. Arrange rice in a large warm serving dish with white rice
in the middle and red and green rice on each side. Serve immediately
with additional Parmesan cheese.

Makes 6 to 8 servings.
