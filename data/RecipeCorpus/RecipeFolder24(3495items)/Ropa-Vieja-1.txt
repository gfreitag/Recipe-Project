and green pepper and saute until transparent.  Add the garlic, bay
leaf, oregano, cumin, and cook 5 minutes longer.

Combine tomato sauce, sugar, vinegar, stock, salt, and wine.  Add to
saute. Stir to mix well and bring to a boil.  Lower heat and cook for
approximately 30 minutes, stirring at intervals.

In a 2-1/2 quart casserole with cover, place the shredded meat.  Pour
sauce over the meat and mix well.  Cover and simmer for another 20 to
30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Serve over white rice accompanied
by very ripe fried plantains, when available.
