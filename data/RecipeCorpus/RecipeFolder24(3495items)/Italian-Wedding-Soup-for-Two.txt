To one quart water add four bouillon cubes, Boil a sheaf of spaghetti
in this mixture. The sheaf of spaghetti should be as big as your
thumb. While the spaghetti is cooking, make a paste of: 3 egg yolks
1/4 lb. of butter 2/3 cup of parmesan 1/4 tsp. freshly ground Grenada
Nutmeg Add a little broth to the paste & whisk. Add a little more &
whisk. Add more until paste has become a liquid & then combine all.
This with a salad & French bread is a perfect supper for a wedding
couple.
