Categories: Rice, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings

-cooked brown basmati rice
-to serve vegetables over
4 md Parsnips, sliced thin (peel
-them first)
1 bn Bok choy, chopped/sliced, in
-fairly large chunks
1 cn Black beans, rinsed &
Put the sliced parsnips in a casserole (at least 4 qt.) with a
tablespoon of water. Microwave on high for five minutes or until a
fork can pierce the slices.  Dump the black beans in, and stuff the
bok choy on the top.  If the water has dried up, add a little more.
Microwave until the bok choy is wilted and the stem tender-crisp.
Stir and serve over cooked rice. Let everyone add their own teriaki
sauce.

The natural flavors of the vegetables make this appealing, so go easy
on the sauce or any spices you are inclined to add.
