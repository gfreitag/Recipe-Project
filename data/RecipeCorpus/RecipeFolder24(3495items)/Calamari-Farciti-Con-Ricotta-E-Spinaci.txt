Categories: Seafood, Italian, Vegetable, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM---------------------YIELD: 4 SERVINGS--------------------------
2/3 lb Ricotta
1 ea Egg
1 T  Italian parsley; chopped
Salt, kosher; to taste
Pepper; to taste
1/2 c  Dry white wine
2 c  Canned Italian tomatoes
1 ea Lemon; quartered
8 lg Squid (about 2 pounds)
1 md Onion; minced
1 ea Garlic clove; minced
2 T  Olive oil
1 T  Butter
1/2 lb Spinach, fresh
-or
1/2 ea Pk Spinach, frozen; thawed
If using fresh spinach, trim stems and wash.  If using frozen,
squeeze dry. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Clean the squid and
chop the tentacles finely.  Set them aside. Saut the onion and the
garlic in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the butter until the
onion is soft. Add the tentacles and cook for 2 minutes. Add the
spinach and saut, stirring, until it has wilted. Drain off any extra
liquid and cool the spinach. In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta,
egg, parsley, and the cooled spinach mixture. Mix thoroughly and
season with salt, pepper, and hot pepper flakes. Stuff the mixture
loosely into the squid and close the openings securely with a
toothpick. Use the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to grease a
rectangular baking dish large enough to hold the squid comfortably in
one layer.  Arrange the squid in the dish and add the wine and
tomatoes. Season with salt, pepper and more hot pepper flakes, if you
wish. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the squid is tender and the
sauce has thickened. If there is too much sauce, raise the oven
temperature and allow the liquid to reduce.  If there is too little,
add more white wine. Serve the squid with lemon quarters. Do not
overstuff the squid or they may split while they cook.  Rice and
braised fennel go well with this dish.
