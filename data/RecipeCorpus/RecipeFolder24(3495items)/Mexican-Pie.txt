Categories: Pie/tart, Tex/mexican, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
Salt and pepper, to taste
4 c  Cooked kidney beans, mashed
1 1/2 c  Cornmeal
1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking powder
3 c  Water
2 tb Water or vegetable oil
1 md Onion, diced
1    Green bell pepper, chopped
2 c  Frozen corn kernels
1 sm Can green chilies, chopped
1 c  Tomato sauce
2 tb Chili powder
Heat the water or oil in a large pot over medium heat and cook the
onion for 10 minutes.  Add the green pepper, corn, green chilies,
tomato sauce, chili powder, and salt and pepper and cook for 5
minutes.

Add the mashed beans and cook 10 minutes more over low heat.  Remove
from the heat and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350F.

Combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and water in a large
saucepan and cook over medium heat until the mixture thickens,
stirring constantly with a wire whisk to keep the cornmeal from
lumping. Spread half the cornmeal mixture over the bottom of a
nonstick baking dish. Spread the bean mixture over the cornmeal
mixture, and then add the remaining cornmeal mixture on top,
spreading to cover the beans. Bake for 45 minutes or until the
cornbread is golden.
