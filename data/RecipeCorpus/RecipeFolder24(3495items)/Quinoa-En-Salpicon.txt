heat; simmer 10 minutes longer.  Drain the quinoa and cool.

While the quinoa is cooking, make the vinaigrette.  In a bowl, whisk
together the lime juice, pepper, chile and salt.  Gradually add the
olive oil, stirring constantly.  Set aside.

When the grain has cooled, assemble the salad.  In a bowl place the
quinoa with the cucumber, tomato, scallions, parsley and mint.  Toss
to mix the ingredients, then add the vinaigrette and toss thoroughly.
Season to taste with salt and white pepper.
