Pastry: 180g butter 270g plain Flour 1/2 teaspoon salt chilled water
Filling: 6 eggs 300g caster sugar 3 tablespoons flour 560ml
buttermilk 90g melted butter juice of 1 or 2 limes 1 teaspoon vanilla
extract rind of 1 lime, finely grated cinnamon To serve: rind of 1
lime, coarsely grated creme fraiche

To make the pastry: process the butter, flour and salt in a food
processor until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. With the
motor still running, slowly add the iced water until the pastry forms
a ball. Refregerate the pastry for 1 hour, then roll it out and line
a 23cm fluted flan tin.  To make the filling: beat the eggs and sugar
until light and creamy.

Stir in the flour and add the buttermilk, melted butter, lime juice,
vanilla and finely grated rind.  Pour the filling into the pie shell,
sprinkle with cinnamon and bake in a preheated 190-C oven for 30
minutes or until the filling has set and the pastry is a light golden
colour. Remove from the oven and chill the pie.

To serve: sprinkle the coarsely grated lime rind over the pie and
serve with creme fraiche.  Rosie Cochrane Bon Appetit - Exec.Chef
