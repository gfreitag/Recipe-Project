Title: Ground Meat Kabaabs
Categories: Main dish, Meat, Indian
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 t  Salt
1 lg Clove Garlic, crushed
1/2 t  Ground Ginger
1 t  Lime juice
1 t  Garam Masala
1    Egg
1 T  Oil
1 md Onion, chopped
1 T  Besan flour
1 t  Ground Cumin
1 t  Chirongi nuts
6    Almonds
1 t  Poppy seeds
450 g  Lean Braising steak
1/2 t  Papaya pulp or meat tender.
This dish takes about 1 hour to prepare.  Cook the onion briskly
without any oil in a heavy-based or non-stick frying pan until
transparent.  Roast the besan flour and grond cumin together, then
remove them from the pan and roast the chirongi nuts, almonds and
poppy seeds;  grind these ingredients together.

Mince the meat to a fine paste with all the remaining ingredients
apart from the egg and oil.  Mix the egg thoroughly into the meat
paste, then make small sausage shapes from this mixture.  These
should be fixed on to skewers and (ideally) they should be cooked
over charcoal.  Alternatively, lightly brush the kabaabs with oil and
cook them under a hot grill.  Turn the kabaabs several times during
cooking.  Serve with a salad and thinly sliced onions.
