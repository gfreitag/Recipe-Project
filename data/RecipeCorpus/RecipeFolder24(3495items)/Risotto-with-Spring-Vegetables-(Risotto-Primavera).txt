Prepare chicken broth.  Heat broth in a medium saucepan.  Melt 1/4 cup
butter in a large saucepan.  When butter foams, add onion.  Saute over
medium heat until pale yellow.  Add rice and mix well.  When rice is
coated with buter, add wine.  Cook, stirring constantly, until wine
has evaporated.  Stir in 1 or 2 ladles of broth, or enough to cover
rice. Stir over medium heat until broth has been absorbed. Continue
cooking and stirring rice, adding broth a little at a time, about 10
minutes. Add asparagus tips, peas, zucchini and mushrooms. Cook about
10 minutes longer or until rice is done.  Rice should be tender but
firm to the bite. Remove pan from heat.  Add basil, parsley, 1/3 cup
Parmesan cheese and 1 Tbsp butter; mix well.  Season with salt.
Place in a warm dish. Serve immediately with remaining parmesan
cheese.
