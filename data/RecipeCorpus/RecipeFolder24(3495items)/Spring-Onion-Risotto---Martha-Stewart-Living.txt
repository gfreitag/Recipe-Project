until wine is nearly absorbed. Add a ladleful of stock and cook,

simmering at all times. Continue stirring in stock a ladleful at a

adjust seasonings, and garnish with chives and chive blossoms, if

NOTE: If you can't find Taleggio, substitute one or two tablespoons of
unsalted butter, and increase the Parmesan to one-half cup.
