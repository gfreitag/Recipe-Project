celery and add to stuffing mixture.  Add bacon and pour grease over

of warm water as needed in order to bind the mixture together until
it holds its own shape. Rinse turkey and salt the inside.  Loosely
pack the inside of turkey with stuffing. Dry off the outside of the
turkey by blotting it with paper towels.  Use additional butter to
lightly coat the outside and top of bird, lightly salt and pepper,
and then cook according to directions. (20 per lb) If you are lucky
enough to have stuffing left over, shape into balls to place beside
the turkey when it has about 1-1/2 hours left to bake. Origin:
