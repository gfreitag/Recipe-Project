Categories: Diabetic, Dessert, Cake/cookie
Yield: 18 servings
1 ts Instant tea
2 tb Water
1/2 c  Margarine, melted
Fortunes on slips of paper
3    Egg whites
1/2 c  Sugar
1/8 ts Salt
1/4 ts Vanilla
1 c  All-purpose flour
Mix egg whites, sugar and salt thoroughly with spoon.  Mix in
remaining ingredients, except fortunes.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap
and chill for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Grease baking sheet.  Have clean white cotton
gloves ready to use when folding and shaping the hot cookies.  If
gloves are not available, use two pieces of paper towelling folded to
several thicknesses to protect fingers from the hot cookies.  Also
have some clean muffin tins ready to hold baked cookies while they
cool.

Shape and bake 2 cookies at a time.  For each cookie, drop 1 teaspoon
batter onto a baking sheet.  Spread the batter with back of spoon to
make a 3-inch circle.

Bake at 350F for 3 to 5 minutes, or until edges turn light brown.

WORK VERY QUICKLY.  Remove one cookie with wide spatula to counter
top. Place a fortune paper across center of cookie.  Using gloves or
paper towelling, fold edge of cookie over to make a semicircle.  Hold
cookie on the ends and place the middle of folded edge over top of
muffin pan; bend ends down.  Place folded cookie carefully in a
muffin cup to cool. Repeat process.  Makes 36 cookies.
