Title: Indian Red Gun Powder (Molaha Podi)
Categories: Indian
Yield: 1 batch
2 tb Sesame seeds
1/2 ts Salt; or to taste
1 1/2 tb Brown sugar or palm sugar or
-jaggery
1 ts Vegetable oil
2 tb Channa dal
2 tb Urad dal (white gram)
15    Dry red chile pods
1/2 ts Asafetida
Heat the 1 ts. oil in a wok or heavy skillet over medium heat for 3
minutes. Add the urad and channa dal and chiles.  Fry, stirring
constantly, until the beans begin to turn color, about 3 minutes.

Stir in the asafetida and sesame seeds. Continue frying until the
contents of the pan are nicely browned and smell roasted, about 3
minutes. Turn off the heat, transfer mixture to a plate, and cool
completely. Blend in the sugar and salt.  Grind the mixture to a
powder using a coffee grinder (my preferred method), or a large
mortar and pestle or spice mill. The powder should be neither coarse
nor as fine as flour; it should have a grainy texture.

This mixture stays fresh indefinitely if stored in an airtight
container in a cool place.  Optionally, just before serving, blend a
little oil into as much powder as you might use.

From Julie Sahni's Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking. From:
Jonathan Kandell <jkandell@SkyBlu.CCIT.Arizona.EDU> in
rec.food.recipes. Kandell wrote that this "spicy powder is extremely
hot, but very tasty and addictive.  I find myself eating it plain,
unable to stop; but I'm a strange one." Formatted by Cathy Harned.
