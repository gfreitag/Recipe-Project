Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Hot pepper sauce
5 tb Cheese, blue, crumbled
Lettuce, Romaine
Celery leaves
4 ea Breasts, chicken, halves,
-- broiler/fryer, boned,

2 tb Butter, melted
Pound the chicken breasts down to a 1/4 inch thickness.

In a large glass bowl, make the marinade by mixing together the
butter and hot pepper sauce.

Add the chicken into the marinade, turning to coat; cover and
refrigerate 15 - 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.

Remove the chicken from the marinade and spoon 1 tablespoon of
the blue cheese onto the center of each chicken breast.  Fold in the
sides, rolling the chicken around the blue cheese.  Secure with
wooden picks.

Place the chicken rolls in a baking pan.  Bake in 400 F oven for
30 minutes or until chicken is fork tender.

Set the temperature control at broil or 450 F. Arrange the oven
rack so the chicken is about 8 inches from the heat.  Broil the
chicken for about 5 minutes or until brown.

Remove the wooden picks from the chicken.

Arrange lettuce and chicken on platter.  Garnish with celery
leaves and remaining blue cheese.
