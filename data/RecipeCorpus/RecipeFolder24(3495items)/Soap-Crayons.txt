Categories: Information, Homemade
Yield: 20 servings
2 ea Tb Hot water

Have one large bowl and several small bowls, one for each color.  YOu
will also need an ice cube tray with different sections, or
containers to act as small molds. Put soap flakes in a large bowl and
drop the hot water itno the soap flakes, stirring constantly. The
mixture will be extremely thick and hard to stir. Spoon some of the
soap into each of the small bowls and color each separately, adding
the color by drops until the soap has teh consistency of a very thick
paste. Press spoonfuls of the soap into your molds and set the
crayons in a dry place to harden. They should take a few days to a
week to dry completely. When dry, remove from the molds and allow to
dry for a few more days before using. Yield: 20 Crayons SOURCE:
