~  Alway encourage sensible drinking and be sure to establish a
designated driver at the start of your party.  Don't allow your
guests to drink and drive.  If necessary, call a taxi for any quest
who shouldn't drive. - Always serve plenty of food with alcohol.
High protein, high starch foods such as cheese, meat, breads and
cakes will slow the rate that alcohol is absorbed into the
bloodstream. - Offer guests their choice of attractive alcoholic and
non-alcoholic drinks. - Make sure that all drinks are measured.
Several jiggers at the bar will help ensure that each drink is the
same size. - Plan activities for you guests. The more there is to do
other than drink, the less people will drink to excess. - Providing
your guests with coffee and tea about an hour before festivities end,
and at the same time closing the bar, is a gracefull way of promoting
responsible behaviour. Origin: Alcohol Recipe Booklet. Shared by:
