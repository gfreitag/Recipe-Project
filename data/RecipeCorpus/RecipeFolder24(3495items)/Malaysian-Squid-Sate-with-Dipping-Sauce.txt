Thread the squid rings and tentacles (through the fleshy part) on
bamboo skewers, leaving about 3 inches for a handle. Wrap the handle
in aluminum foil (or soak skewers for 1 hour in water before using.)
Combine cumin, coriander and hot peppers. Toast in a dry skillet
until fragrant; grind go a powder. Mix well with fish sauce, lime
juice and brown sugar. Add squid, marinate on a tray 30 minutes,
turning from time to time. Meanwhile, get a hot fire going on a
grill, and make a dip sauce by combining remaining ingredients. Grill
squid about 90 seconds on each side. Serve with dipping sauce on the
side. per Stephen Ceideburg
