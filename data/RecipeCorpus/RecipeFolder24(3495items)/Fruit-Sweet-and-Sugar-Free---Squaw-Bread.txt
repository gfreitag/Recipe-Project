Categories: Bread, Fruit
Yield: 2 round loaf
3 c  Unbleached white flour
1 T  Salt
1 c  Rye flour
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 c  Cornmeal for baking pan
Softened butter for
1 1/4 c  Raisin water
1/2 c  Raisins
1 c  Lukewarm water
2 T  Dry baker's yeast
1/2 c  Fruit sweetener
1/3 c  Oil
garnish

First plump the raisins by brining 1-1/4 cups water to a boil and
adding 1/2 cup raisins. Turn off the heat and let the raisins sit in
the water for at least 10 minutes. Drain the raisins, reserving the
raising water. Add only enough lukewarm water to the raisin water to
make a total of 2-1/4 cups. Put the raisins aside.

To Prepare the dough by machine: ********************************
Combine the oil, unbleached white flour, salt, rye flour, and 2 cups
of the whole wheat flour in the mixing bowl of your electric mixer.
Stir in the activated yeast. Once the flour is incorporated increase
the mixer spead to medium. Use the dough hook to knead the dough for
about 10 minutes, adding only enough flour to form a medium stiff
dough that comes off the sides and bottom of the bowl. Reduce the
speed and gently knead in the raisins.

To Prepare the dough by hand: ***************************** Combine
the oil, unbleached flour, salt, rye flour, and 2 cupts of the whole
wheat flour in a medium size mixing bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir
in the activated yeast. Mix all together to form a medium soft dough.
Sprinkle a little whole wheat flour on your work surface. Knead the
dough, adding additional flour only if necessary to keep the dough
from sticking. Knead the dough for 15-20 minutes until to becomes
smooth and quite elastic.

Raising the Dough and Forming the Loaves:
***************************************** Place the well kneaded
dough in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
let the dough rise in a warm, draft free place until doubled. Remove
the plastic wrap from the bowl, and using your fist, gently deflat
the dough by punching it down. Knead the dough in the bowl about 10
times. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and again let the dough rise
until doubled in size. Punch the dough down again and turn out onto a
very lightly floured surface. Divide the dough in half, Knead each
half 8-10 times. Turn the dough over and, by placing your fingers on
the bottom of the dough and your thumbs on tope, "cup" each half to
form 2 round loaves. Place them on a cornmeal sprinkled, baking paper
lined baking pan. Put the loaves in a draft free spot to proof until
doubled in size.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. With a serrated knife, cut a cross
on the top of each loaf. Bake the loaves in the preheated oven for
45-50 minutes. When the loaves are removed from the oven, brush their
tops with softened butter.
