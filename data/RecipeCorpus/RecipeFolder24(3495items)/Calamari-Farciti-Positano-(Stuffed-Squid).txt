Clean and skin the calamari.  In a skillet, heat the olive oil and
pancetta over medium heat. SautÂ‚ the onions, garlic, red and green
bell peppers, and crushed red pepper until onions are lightly
browned. (Pancetta is Italian bacon, and can be obtained at any good
Italian supermarket). Stir in the mushrooms and cook until mushrooms
become moist. Add parsely, celery leaves and chopped squid tentacles
and cook for a minute while stirring lightly. Add wine and bring to a
boil. Stir in the rice thoroughly. Remove from heat and allow to
cool.  When mixture is lukewarm, stir in bread crumbs, cheese, and
egg, plus salt and pepper to taste. Load the mixture into a pastry
bag with a large tip.  Squeeze the stuffing into the bodies of the
calamari. After stuffing all the calamari, fold the open ends shut
and secure with toothpicks. PREHEAT OVEN TO 400 DEGREES F. To make
the sauce, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute
the garlic and crushed red pepper for 30 seconds, then add tomatoes,
juice, and fish stock. Bring to a boil and reduce by about one-third.
Add basil and salt and pepper to taste. Put the stuffed calamari into
the sauce.  Return the sauce to a boil, then put the skillet into a
400-degree oven for 10 minutes.  Remove the calamari from the sauce
and keep warm. Put the sauce over a medium heat and reduce for 10
minutes, until appropriately thick. Add chopped parsley and stuffed
calamari.  Heat through, and serve with lots of sauce. Suggested
wine: Lacrima Christi Rosato
