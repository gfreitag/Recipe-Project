completly with water) Rinse beans next morning, add water to cover,
put ingredients into pan and par boil them,together for 45 to 60
minutes. (beans are ready for baking when you can remove one with a
spoon, blow on it and the skin shrinks back. Bake in a bean pot for
3hrs. at 225F, then 3hrs at 300F. Also you have to add water to them,
just enough to keep them covered. Stir every now and then.
Note: Old Timers would only use Salt Pork not bacon, my
mother said so!
