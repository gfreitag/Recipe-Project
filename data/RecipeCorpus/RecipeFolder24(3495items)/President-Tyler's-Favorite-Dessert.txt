President Tyler called his favorite dessert Tyler's Pudding, but most
desserts then were referred to as pudding.  Today we call this recipe
a coconut custard pie.  If you shred fresh coconut, as the Tylers
did, the recipe makes as rich and fresh a pie today as it did when
Tyler enjoyed it. 4 eggs. slightly beaten 1/2 c sugar 1/4 tsp salt 1
1/2 c milk, scalded 3/4 c heavy cream, scalded 1 tsp vanilla extract
1 c shredded fresh coconut One unbaked 9-inch pastry shell

Add sugar and salt to eggs in a bowl and beat until just blended.
Gently mix in the scalded milk and cream and vanilla extract.  Strain
mixture into a bowl; stir in the coconut.  Turn into pastry shell.
Bake at 450F for ten minutes.  Reduce temperature to 350F and bake
about 25 minutes longer, or until knife inserted halfway between
center and edge of filling comes out clean.  Cool on a wire rack.
Store in refrigerator until to serve. Makes one 9-inch pie. Source:
