Title: Custard Sauce (Creme Anglaise)
Categories: Dessert, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
2 t  Vanilla (or other flavor)
-extract
1 T  Butter, softened
1 1/2 c  Milk
4 ea Egg yolks
1/3 c  Sugar
Heat the milk to almost a simmer in a small saucepan. Beat the egg
yolks with the sugar in a mixing bowl. Beat yolks and sugar until the
mixture is thick and forms a ribbon. Beat in the vanilla, and then
add the hot milk slowly. Pour back into the saucepan, and cook over
very low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the
mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove
immediately from the heat, and whisk in the softened butter. Press
plastic wrap directly into the surface. The plastic wrap prevents a
crust from forming. Chill well before serving.
