Title: Arni Sti Stamna (Lamb in a Pottery Dish)
Categories: Greek, Meat, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
5 oz Kefalotiri or feta cheese
-- cut into 6 slices
1 tb All-purpose flour
3/4 c  Dry white wine
1/2 c  Hot water
1/2 c  Pure olive oil
1    Leg of baby lamb (5-6 lbs)
-- boned and cut into
-- 6 large chunks
1    Lemon; juiced
2 lg Ripe tomatoes
-- peeled, seeded & diced
Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a large, heavy skillet.  Saute the lamb
chunks until they are evenly browned.  Transfer them to a shallow
pottery baking dish large enough to hold all the meat in 1 layer.
Sprinkle with lemon juice, spread the diced tomatoes on top, and
season with salt and pepper. Place one slice of cheese on each piece
of lamb.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.

Heat the remaining oil in the skillet and add the flour.  Stir over
medium heat for a few minutes, until the mixture is smooth and
lightly colored. Turn the heat to low and add the wine and hot water.
Stir constantly until the mixture thickens slightly.  Pour the sauce
over the lamb. Place the cover on the pottery dish and carefully wrap
the whole dish in aluminum foil to seal in the moisture.  Bake for
about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove the foil and serve immediately.
