Source: The National Culinary Review, Feb'94 This recipe can also be
prepared on an outdoor grill.  You can substitute a commercial
Jamaican seasoning mixture for the Jamaican jerk rub, if desired. Red
beans and rice are a typical Jamaican side dish that would go well
with the tilapia fillets. 4 tilapia fillets (about 1 1/2 pounds
total) 2 plantains or large under-ripe bananas 1 tablespoon butter or
margarine Jamaican jerk rub 1 jalapeno pepper, cored, seeded and
finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced 1 tablespoon grated
fresh ginger 2 tablespoons allspice, freshly ground, if possible 1/2
teaspoon nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon freshly ground black
pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Method: Make
jerk rub by combining jalapeno pepper, garlic, ginger, allspice,
nutmeg, cinnamon, pepper and salt.  Add oil, stirring to make a
coarse paste.  Rub jerk mixture on both sides of tilapia fillets.
Cover and refrigerate for about 15 minutes.

Broil fillets on oiled rack 2 to 3 inches from heat for 3 to 5
minutes. Turn carefully and broil for another 3 to 5 minutes. While
fillets are cooking, peel plantains and slice on the diagonal into
1/2-inch slices. Saute in butter over medium-high heat until browned,
1 to 2 minutes. Turn and brown other side.  Arrange fillets on 4
warmed dinner plates with sauteed plantain slices alongside. Serve
with red beans and rice, if desired.
