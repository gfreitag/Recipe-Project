Yield: 1 batch
1 1/2 tb Garlic; minced
-- (abt. 12 large cloves)

1 c  Chopped fresh cilantro

In blender, puree enough chili peppers to measure one cup when done.
Puree parsley & cilantro together; blend well w/the pureed chili

Store zhoug, refrigerated.  Will remain fresh for many months.

Yield:  1 1/2 cups.

The authors write: "Spicy zhoug is a source of pride among the
Yemenite population.  Made with the sharpest of chili peppers, it is
eaten with classically oriental Jewish meals.

"More than just a condiment, zhoug is a tradition.  Yemenites believe
that daily consumption of zhoug wards off disease and strengthens the
heart. Zhoug can be an addition to salads and a sauce for various
kinds of meat, fish, and poultry dishes."

Caution:  While quite hot, this stuff is addictive!  It's excellent
slathered on Saltines and accompanied by a cold brewski.  I've seen
people go through entire containers of zhoug, which was nicknamed
"Truth or Dare" here to separate the wheat from the chaff as far as
heat lovers go.
