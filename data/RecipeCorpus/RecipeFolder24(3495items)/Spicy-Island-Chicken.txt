Title: Spicy Island Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Low-cal/fat, Chicken, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
8 oz Green beans; frozen
1 pk Chicken-flavor noodles&sauce
1 c  Noodles; uncooked, 2 c large
1 tb Coconut, flaked
1 c  Chicken, cooked
2 3/4 c  Water
1 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Curry powder
2 ts Lime juice
If using large noodles or macaroni, use 2 c uncooked.

Shred chicken.  Stir together water, garlic, curry, and lime juice.
Bring to boil, then stir in noodles & sauce and additional noodles.
Continue boiling over medium heat 5 minutes, until noodles are almost
tender. Stir frequently, as the noodles will not be covered by the
water. Stir in frozen vegetables, then chicken and coconut; heat
through.

Sylvia's comments: In spite of its name, this was more flavorful than
spicy.  For a more fiery effect, use more curry powder.
