Categories: Diabetic, Bread
Yield: 16 servings
1/2 ts Salt
3 tb Soft margarine or veg. oil
3/4 c  Raisins (optional)
1 3/4 c  Buttermilk
OR 1 3/4 tb lemon juice
OR 1 3/4 tb vinegar

1 c  All-purpose flour (see note)
3/4 c  Whole-wheat flour
3/4 c  Rye flour
3/4 c  Graham flour
3/4 c  Rolled oats
2 tb Granulated sugar
1 tb Baking powder

Mix vinegar or lemon juice with milk for sour milk and set aside.  If
using powdered skim milk, use almost 2/3 cup powder and enough water
to make 1 1/2 cup milk.  Stir, then add lemon juice, then add enough
water to make the 1 3/4 cup measure.

If you do not have all the different kinds of flour, use what you do
have to make 3 1/4 cups, or try 1/4 cup wheat germ or bran plus 3 cups
all-purpose flour.  Make a note of the ingredients and a note of the
result.

Sugar could possibly be left out, especially if 2 tbsp. or more of
raisins (or finely chopped dates) are used.

Combine dry ingredients in a bowl.  Cut in margarine or oil.  Stir in
raisins (if using) and add buttermilk or sour milk to make a soft
dough.

Knead lightly on a floured surface until smooth.  Place on a greased
baking sheet and flatten into a circle about 2 1/2 inches thick.  Cut
large X about 1/4 inch deep on top.  OR make 2 smaller loaves.

Bake at 350 F for about 1 hour or until toothpick inserted in the
center comes out clean.
