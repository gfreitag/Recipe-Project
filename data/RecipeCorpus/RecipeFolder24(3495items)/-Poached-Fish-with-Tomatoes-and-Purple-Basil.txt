2 ea Halibut, filets,
-- (@ 6oz ea)
5 oz Butter, unsalted
1 c  Tomatoes, seeded,

Remove the skin from the filets.  In a saute pan, melt 1 ounce of
butter, and add the fish.  Cover the fish with fish stock and adjust
the seasoning.  Cover with buttered parchment paper, (buttered side

Turn the fish and cook an additional 2 minutes.

Remove the pan from the heat, remove the parchment paper, and let
the pan sit for a minute.

Remove the fish from the pan and drain on a napkin.  Pass the fish
stock through a strainer to another saute pan and bring to a boil
over high heat. Reduce by one-third.

Add the tomatoes and basil to the reduced liquid, heat through,
then add 4 ounces of butter, salt and pepper, and whisk.

Place the fish on a serving plate, spoon the sauce over the fish,
and garnish with basil leaves.
