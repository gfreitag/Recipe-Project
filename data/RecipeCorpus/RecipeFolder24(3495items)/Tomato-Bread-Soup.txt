No Ingredients Found
In Italy, bread is usually bought fresh daily because it contains
little or no fat and doesn't keep well.  The Italians however, have
come up with a myriad of dishes like this that use up leftover bread.
This fresh tomato soup is perfect for those last few days of Indian
summer, when tomatoes are still plentiful and the evenings have a
hint of the chill to come. 1 tbsp olive oil 1 small leek (white part
only) chopped 4 cloves garlic, minced 2 cups chopped peeled tomatoes
(about 1 lb) 1/3 cup chopped fresh basil 1-1/2 cups vegetable or
chicken stock 1/2 tsp salt and pepper 2 cups day old cubed Italian
bread 2 tbsp freshly grated parmesan cheese

In heavy saucepan, heat oil over medium heat.  Cook leek and garlic,
stirring for 3 minutes or until softened.  Stir in tomatoes and basil.
Bring to boil.  Boil gently for 5-10 minutes or until slightly
thickened. Add 1 cup of the stock, salt and pepper.  Bring to boil,
stirring. Remove from heat and stir in bread.  If necessary, warm
remaining stock and add enough to reach desired consistency.  Serve
in warmed soup bolws, sprinkle with parmesan.  Makes 2 servings. Per
