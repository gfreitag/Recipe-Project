Using wet, hot towels, moisten the bean curd skin sheets and set aside
until ready to use. Cover with hot towels to retain the moisture. In
separate small bowls, cover the dried shrimp and mushrooms with a
little boiling water. When soft, drain and mince finely with a knife
or cleaver. Mince the ginger. Finely chop scallions. In 1 tablespoon
oil, stir-fry the minced shrimp, mushrooms and bamboo shoot, adding 1
tablespoon of the soy sauce, the sherry, sugar, flavor enhancer and
black pep- per to taste. After a minute, when most of the liquid has
evaporated, stir in the scallions and remove the filling to a
container to cool. In a large, flat, rectangular pan, combine chicken
stock and remaining soy sauce. Dip a softened bean curd sheet into
stock mixture and lay out flat on a work surface. Sprinkle lightly
with filling. Repeat dipping process with a second bean curd sheet,
laying it on top of the first and sprinkling it with a little
filling. Cover with a third sheet which has been dipped in the stock
but do not sprinkle with filling. Make sure all the corners of the
bean curd skin package are thoroughly moistened and gently fold into
a 7x5-inch shape. Set aside. Make a batter by combining the eggs with
a little water and beating. Stirring vigorously, pour the egg mixture
into the flour. The resulting batter should have the consistency of
heavy cream. Add more water if necessary. Heat oil for deep-frying in
a wok to 300 F. Moisten the whole pie with the egg batter and gently
slip into the hot oil. Increase the heat and cook, turning
occasionally and gently, until the pie is golden brown on both sides.
The pie may form pockets of air in the center and puff up. If this
happens while you are cooking it, prick them with the point of a
sharp pin. Drain well and cut in 8 to 10 rect- angular pieces. Serve
wrapped in a PANCAKE with SAUCE and a SCALLION BRUSH and garnish with
parsley and decorative radishes. PANCAKES: Pour the boiling water
into the flour and mix well with chopsticks. Gather the dough into a
ball and on a well-floured surface, knead about 10 minutes until
dough is smooth and satiny. Set aside, cover with a damp cloth and
let rest about 15 minutes. After resting, roll dough into a
cylandrical shape about 1-1/2 inches in diameter. Cut crosswise into
12 rounds. Lightly brush some oil on one side of each piece. Place
two pieces together with the oiled sides together, resembling a
little sandwich. Roll each sandwich into a 6 to 7-inch circle. Cook
the dough circles one at a time on an ungreased skillet over low heat
1 minute, then turn over. When very lightly browned, remove from heat
and carefully separate into individual pancakes. Serve immediately or
reheat by heating them over a small quantity of water. SAUCE: Combine
all ingredients and serve as a sauce for the vegetable pie or for
Peking Duck. SCALLION BRUSHES: Trim off root ends of scal- lions. Cut
2-3-inch pieces off lower white end. Using the point of a small,
thin, sharp knife, score the white ends in 1-inch cuts, cutting away
from the greens. Evenly space 5-8 cuts a- round the circumference of
each stalk, so that the ends may open out. When cut, drop in ice
water until the ends curl. Temperature(s): HOT Effort: DIFFICULT
