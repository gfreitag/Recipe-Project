Title: Roasted Peppers
Categories: Appetizer, Italian
Yield: 1 various
Garlic, minced
Olive oil
lg Bell peppers
Salt and pepper
This is the traditional way to roast peppers.  Use red, yellow or
green bell peppers.  Try a combination.

Begin by lighting a charcoal fire, letting it burn until the coals
glow and are no longer flaming.  Peppers can also be roasted on a
stovetop char grill or under the oven broiler.

Rinse the peppers.  Place over or under the heat source and broil
turning frequently until the skins are charred and blistered and the
peppers are softened.

Place the peppers, a few at a time, in a brown paper bag and close.
Allow to stand for 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the bag and remove
the skins and seeds under cold running water.  The skins will peel
away easily. Cut into 2 inch strips and place in a bowl.  Season with
salt and pepper. Add minced garlic if desired.  Cover with olive oil
and serve at room temperature.  These will keep in the refrigerator
for several days.  Cover completely with olive oil prior to
refrigerating.
