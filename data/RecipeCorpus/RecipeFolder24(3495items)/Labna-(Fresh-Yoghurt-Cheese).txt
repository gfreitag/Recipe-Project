1 t  Salt
1 kg Full milk natural yoghurt
Mix yoghurt with salt.  Line a plastic strainer with cheesecloth or
muslin. Pour in yoghurt and leave to drain for 2 days in the
refrigerator. The whey will drain away, leaving a soft piquant
cheese. Pour off the accumulated whey from time to time so the cheese
is not sitting in moisture. The texture should be that of cream
cheese. If there is too much retained moisture, the cheese will not
keep its shape. Use as a whole cheese mixed with fresh herbs, chopped
chives, spring onions or sprinkled with paprika. Serve with pita.
