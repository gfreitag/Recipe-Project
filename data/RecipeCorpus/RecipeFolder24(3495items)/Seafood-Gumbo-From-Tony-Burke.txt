1) *Make seafood stock from shrimp heads and shells, crab bodies, fish
carcasses or all of the above, substituting ham hocks, chicken backs,
or necks, or other meats depending on availability. (For the 4 quarts
of stock you will need about 4 pounds of shells, bones and meat.)
Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer several hours. Strain the
stock, discarding solids. (If time is a factor, simmer shrimp heads
and shells and ham hocks in chicken stock for at least an hour.) 2)
Cook okra in the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat, stirring
and scraping until some of the sliminess is gone; about 15 minutes.
Add tomatoes, onions, celery, garlic, peppers, vinegar, the seasoning
and herb mix and cook over low to medium heat for about 1/2 hour,
stirring and scraping often. 3) Blend the roux into the okra and
tomato mixture. Very slowly blend the stock into the mixture. Simmer
about 1 hour. 4) Add crab and shrimp and simmer 10 to 15 minutes. Add
oysters and simmer about 5 minutes. Add green onions. Serve over rice
with file` powder added to taste at the table. (File` powder should
not be cooked.) Source: Overton Anderson
