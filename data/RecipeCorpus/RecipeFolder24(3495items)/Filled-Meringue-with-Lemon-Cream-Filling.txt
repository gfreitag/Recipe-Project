MERINGUES

Preheat oven to 150 C (300 F).  Cover a baking sheet with parchment
paper or aluminium foil.  Trace one 9" circle or eight 3" circles;
set aside.

In large bowl, beat egg whites with electric mixer until foamy; add
cream of tartar and vanilla.  Beat on medium speed until soft peaks
form.

Gradually add sugar 1 tablespoon at a time beating on high speed
until very stiff peaks form (tips should stand straight).

Spread meringue over circle(s), building up sides to form a shell.
Bake 50 minutes for single shell or 35 to 40 minutes for mini shells.
Turn off oven;  let meringue(s) dry in oven at least one hour.

LEMON CREAM FILLING

In medium saucepan, combine sugar and cornstarch; stir in milk.

Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until bubbly.  Reduce
heat; cook 2 minutes longer.

In small bowl, lightly beat egg yolks.  Gradually add about 1/2 cup
of hot milk mixture to eggs, stirring constantly.  Return hot eggs to
saucepan; cook until very thick.

Remove from heat.  Beat in sour cream, lemon rind and lemon juice.
Chill until thickened, about 2 hours.

Spoon Lemon Filling into meringue shell(s).  Garnish with whipped
cream and fresh fruit if desired.  Chill 2 to 4 hours before serving.
