Title: Masala Tea
Categories: Beverage, Indian
Yield: 8 servings
12    Black Peppercorn;(opt)
12 ts Sugar;(or to taste)
6 ts Leaf Tea (heaping) OR
-9 tea bags (orange pekoe)
6 c  -Cold Water
1/3 c  Milk;(or to taste)
1    3" stick Cinnamon
6    Green Cardamoms, whole
4    Cloves, whole
Combine water and milk in a deep pan, and bring to a boil. Add
the spices and sugar. Stir to blend, and turn off the heat. Cover the
pan, and let the spices soak for at least 10 minutes.
Add the tea leaves or tea bags, and bring the water to a second
boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 5 minutes. Uncover, check
the color and taste, and if desired add more milk and sugar. Strain
the tea into a warm teapot, and serve immediately.

Note: This is the way traditional spiced tea is made. You may,
however, omit the milk or sugar, or both, in which case reduce the
quantity of tea to 2 heaping teaspoons or 3 tea bags.
