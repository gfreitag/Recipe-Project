Title: Rogig (Grape Walnut Candy)
Categories: Middle east, Candy
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Cornstarch
3/4 c  Corn syrup
Walnut halves
3 qt Grape juice
3 c  Flour
3 c  Sugar
First, string the walnut halves on thread. Using medium to heavy
cotton thread, cut thread to about 24 inches long. With a thin
needle, carefully pass the thread through the walnut halves, leaving
some extra string exposed on either end. Knot both ends of the string.

Blend flour, sugar, cornstarch and corn syrup. Add juice and mix until
smooth. Pour half of the mixture into a large, heavy saucepan, bring
to a boil and boil, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick.
Remove from heat.

Dip one string of walnuts at a time into the hot grape juice mixture
several times, and let the excess coating drip into the pan. Transfer
the walnuts to a drying rack - you can rig up a rack by propping a
broom handle between two chairs; place a pan and newspapers
underneath to catch the drips - and dry overnight. Reserve leftover
cooked grape mixture.

The next day, cook the remaining grape mixture. Pass the remaining
mixture through a sieve and add to the grape mixture in the pan. Dip
the walnuts several more times in the hot grape mixture. Hang to dry
several days in a dark, cool place. To store or serve, remove walnuts
from the string and rll rogig in powdered sugar. Store in a covered
jar or tin.

NOTE: White grape juice or other fruit juices such as pear or apple
can be used.
