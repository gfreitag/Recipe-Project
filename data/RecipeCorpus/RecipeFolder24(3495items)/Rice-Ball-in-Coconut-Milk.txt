Title: Rice Ball in Coconut Milk
Categories: Dessert, Thai, Rice, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Rice flour
1/2 c  Arrowroot
3 c  Coconut milk
Mix the rice flour, arrowroot & 1/4 c cold water.  Turn the mixture
out onto a smooth surface & knead it to the consistency of a pie
crust. Add more water if needed.  Shape into 1 1/2" balls.

Fill a large pot half full with water & bring to a boil.  Drop the
balls into the boiling water, four at a time.  Boil for 4 to 5
minutes or until they float to the top.  Cook the rest of the balls
this way.

In a large pot, heat the coconut milk, sugar, salt & vanilla over
medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes.  Add the rice balls & cook, stirring
constantly, until the milk starts to boil.  Serve hot.
