A very special way a doing trout fillets, inspired by a dish created
by chef Seppi Renngli at the Four Seasons. In a skillet large enough
to hold the fillets melt about 3 tablespoons butter and, when almost
sizzling, add trout.  Saute on one side for about 3-minutes, turn,
cover for a minute, and then saute the other side. A total of 6-7
minutes should do it.
Salt and pepper the fish and remove to a warm place, add nuts for a
moment to the pan to toast, then toss over the trout fillets.
Meanwhile, in a separate small, sturdy pan, heat enough oil so that
a small strainer can be lowered into it.
Let capers drain in the strainer.
Returning to the trout pan, splash in tablespoon or two of wine,
then add stock and cream and boil down rapidly, stirring in just a
taste of the tomato paste and a little more butter. When reduced and
slightly thickened, spoon this little bit of pan sauce over the
fillets.
Now quickly lower the capers into the almost smoking oil. Let them
sputter and sizzle a few seconds, then remove the strainer and shake
free of oil.  Distribute fried capers in neat piles at either end of
the fillets and serve immediately.
