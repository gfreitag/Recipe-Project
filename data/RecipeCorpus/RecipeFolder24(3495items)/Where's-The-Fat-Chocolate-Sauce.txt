Byal writes: "Attention, chocoholics.  You can now stir up a fudgy
chocolate sauce, completely free of fat, that rivals the real thing.
Our fat-saving tips are simple.  Use unsweetened cocoa powder and
evaporated skim milk instead of chocolate and cream.  To add silky
thickness, stir in a little cornstarch.  For each tablespoon of
sauce, you'll save more than 100 calories and 9 grams of fat over hot
fudge sauce."
