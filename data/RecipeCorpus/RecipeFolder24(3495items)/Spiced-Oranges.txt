Put oranges and salt in a large saucepan, pour in enough hot water to

reduce heat to low and simmer until oranges are tender - about 50
minutes. Remove pan from heat, drain oranges and place on a board to
cool. Bring sugar, golden syrup, vinegar, water, cardamom seeds,
peppercorns, cinnamon, allspice and cloves to boil over moderate
heat. Set aside to cool. Using a sharp knife, cut oranges in thin
slices. Pour sugar-vinegar syrup through a strainer into a large
saucepan and discard solids. Add orange slices, place pan over
moderate heat and bring to the boil, shaking pan and stirring gently
to avoid breaking orange slices.  Reduce heat and simmer for 20
minutes. Remove mixture from heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
