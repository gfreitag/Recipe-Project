Categories: Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
(celery, carrots, green
Pepper, canned
Tomatoes, mushrooms,
Eggplant, whatevers
Available)
1/2    To 1 cup apple juice
x  Water
2    Onions, chopped in food
Processor
x  Several cloves garlic,
Crushed
2    3 teaspoons semi-hot curry
Powder (a good blend)
x  Variety chopped vegies
In non-stick pot, place onions and garlic, stir til lightly browned,
add a little water and deglaze, add spices.   Cook about five minutes
until onions are soft, adding a little more water as needed to
prevent burning. Add vegies, apple juice, cook til vegies are done.
I never made this with generic curry powder, I don't think it would
be as good.
