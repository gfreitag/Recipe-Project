Real sugar - add 48 calories & 12.4 grams carbohydrate per extra Tb.
Cornstarch - add 29 calories & 7 grams carbohydrate per extra Tb. Egg
~ subtract 1 med-fat meat exchange if not used. Adjust for the number
of servings.

Note:  original recipe is for a sauce, try 2 tbsp cornstarch and
divide among 3 dishes for a pudding/pie filling with one crumbled
graham cracker and a shake of cinnamon in the bottom of each dish.

EGGLESS:  1 or 2 extra tsp. cornstarch (5 tsp or 2 tb.) would likely
thicken the sauce without the egg.  1 tsp. cornstarch plus 3 tb.
liquid is given as an equivalent to 1 whole egg in the book called
Substituting Ingredients.

Lemon Sauce may be served with cake, gingerbread, and crisp meringues
with strawberries or other fruit (Pavlova is the common name in
Australian cookbooks).
