Quickly when the pieces are

"Chicken Like `The Kernel's'
Begin with about 3 lbs

-depth of oil about 3
-inches) to a temperature of
425 ea Degrees.
I prefer my Oster Super
-Cooker++but using an
-electric deep fryer I would
Have the temperature at 400
-degrees. Put about 2 cups
-milk or Club Soda or
Beer in a deep, narrow bowl
-& dip each piece chicken
-in the liquid, letting
The excess drip off. Dust
-lightly but evenly in Aunt
-Jemima Pancake Flour
(or a good brand). DO NOT
-OVERCOAT!!! Dry pieces a
-few minutes without
2 pk Good Seasonings Italian or
-Mild Italian Salad
-Dressing mix
Used right from the package.
3 T  Flour
2 t  Salt (that's not too much)
1/4 c  Lemon juice (or vinegar)
2 T  Margarine or cooking oil
Spread this paste evenly
-over chicken pieces; stack
-in a bowl; cover and
Refrigerate at least two
-hours or better yet,
-overnight. About 1 hour
Before serving, heat about
-1 1/2 pints cooking oil in
-heavy saucepan (9
Inches in diameter, with
letting them touch each other. Fry few pieces at a time. Place on a
cookie sheet without letting them touch each other and bake uncovered
350 degrees 30 minutes. Serves about 6 to 8 people. I encourage you
to experiment with amount of salad dressing mix according to your own
taste preferences. But much of it washes off in milk so 2 pkgs
needed! Cracklin Good Gravy Blend till smooth 1 c water & 1/4 cup
cornstarch (in blender). In sauce pan over medium heat combine this
with 10-oz can Banquet Chicken Broth or home made stock, 2 chicken
bouillon cubes, two (10-oz ea) cans Franco American Beef Gravy. Stir
until thick & clear. Serve over chicken, thoroughly heated. Serves 6
nicely. A PINCH of sage to this does wonders for flavor. Bouillon
powder may be substituted for the cubes if you wish." To go with the
above, we have the following... "Keen-tucky Coleslaw Slice enough
cabbage, paper thin, that you have 6 cups. Toss lightly with 1/4 cup
sugar, 1 cup finely shredded carrots. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper, & drench it all with 1/2 cup milk. Cover &
refrigerate it about 15 minutes. Meanwhile combine 1 cup mayonnaise
(NOT salad dressing), 1/2 cup dairy buttermilk, 1/2 teaspoon celery
seed, 2 or 3 drops hot pepper sauce, 3 tablespoons dry minced onion.
Mix well with cabbage mixture. Refrigerate again at least an hour
before serving. Drain some of the dressing first and serve it
separately at the table. The coleslaw does settle quite a bit during
refrigeration. Keeps 24 hours only. Serves 6 to 8 nicely."
