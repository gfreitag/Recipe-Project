Though much of Oriental cooking calls for honey, the sugar, in the
amount listed here, is very necessary to the result of this recipe.
It adds a wonderful and authentic quality that honey cannot equal.

Slice the steak very thin across the grain diagonally, from top to
bottom. The objective is to end up with wide, thinly sliced pieces.
Score each piece lightly with a cross. Combine the remaining
ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Add meat to the marinade, making
sure that all the sides are well coated. Meat can be grilled
immediately, but it is best to marinate for at least two hours, or
longer.
To cook: A charcoal grill will give the best results by far,
but in a pinch the meat can be grilled on an open electric grill or
in the oven broiler.
Great with sticky rice and various Korean Kim Chi's,
store-bought or otherwise.
