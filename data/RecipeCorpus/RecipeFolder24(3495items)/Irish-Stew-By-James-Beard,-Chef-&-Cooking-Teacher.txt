James Beard's Irish Stew

* Instructions *

Trim the fat from the chops, leaving the meat on the bones. Butter a
2 or 2-1/2 quart casserole dish. Preheat the oven to 300dF.

In the bottom of the casserole dish arrange a layer of one-third of
the potatoes and cover with a layer of chops topped with a third of
the parsley-thyme mixture.

Add a layer of half the onions, then a third more potatoes, the
remaining chops, herbs, remaining onions, and finally, the remaining
potatoes and herbs. Season well with salt and pepper and add the
water.

Cover and cook the stew in the preheated over for 2 to 2-1/2 hours, or
until the meal is tender and the potatoes and onions are soft.

Serve in soup plates with a sprinkling of parsley on top, and drink
beer with with if you'd like.

Irish stew always benefits from being cooked the day before and
allowed to cool thoroughly. You may refrigerate. Skim off any fat and
reheat the stew before serving.
