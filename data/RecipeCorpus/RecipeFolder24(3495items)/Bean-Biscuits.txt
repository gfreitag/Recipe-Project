Revised after testing Feb 94.  Used 1 1/2 cup flour NOT 2 1/2 cups as
printed in the book.  The 1 cup beans probably replaced 1 cup flour
in the original recipe.

Stir dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl.  Cut in butter until
mixture resembles crumbs.

In food processor or blender, puree beans with milk.  OR mash beans
and stir in milk.  Stir into dry ingredients all at once to make
light soft dough.

Turn out onto lightly floured board, sprinkle with flour and knead
about 20 seconds.

Shape biscuits by rolling, patting and cutting or divide dough into 16
pieces and shape by hand.

Bake at 400 F for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.
