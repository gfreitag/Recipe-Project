Title: Spoon River Rolled Cookies
Categories: Diabetic, Dessert, Cake/cookie
Yield: 36 servings
1 ts Nutmeg; (optional)
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Sour cream;
1/2 c  Vegetable shortening
1 1/4 c  Sugar;
2    Eggs, (large)
1 ts Vanilla
1 ts Lemon extract;
3 c  All-purpose flour
Cream shortening and sugar together at medium speed until well
blended. Add eggs and flavorings, and beat at medium speed until
creamy, scraping down the bowl before and after adding eggs and
flavorings. Stir flour, nutmeg if desired, baking powder, baking soda
and salt together to blend well; add, along with sour cream to
creamy. Cover and refrigerate from 3 hours to overnight. Return dough
to room temperature. Roll out on a lightly floured board to 1/4"
thick. Cut with a 2 1/2 round cutter or an equivalent (see Note
below). Place dough on cookie sheets that have been sprayed with pan
spray or lined luminum foil.  Bake at 350 for 8 to 10 minutes, or
until cookies are lightly browned.  Remove them to a wire rack and
cool to room temperature.
NOTE: Nutritive values for these cookies are based on the use of
the 2 1/2 round cutter and weight of a little over 1 ounce per
cookie. You may use other cutters as long as the finished cookie
weighs about 1 ounce per cookie, and you might even make a 2-ounce
cookie and figure the nutritive value and exchanges as twice those
for the smaller cookie. You may add flavorings other than vanilla and
lemon; if add nuts, raisins and the like, however, you are altering
the nutritve values and exchanges for each cookie. Food Exchanges per
serving: 1 STARCH/BREAD EXCHANGE + 1 FAT EXCHANGE CAL: 108, FAT: 5g,
