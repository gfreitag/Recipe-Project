Tart case: puff pastry filling for 1 tart: 1 teaspoon juniper berries
1/2 cup gin 2 quail flour 1 tablespoon butter oil white wine 12 black
grapes 1/2 cup strong concentrated stock watercress for garnish

To cook tart case: roll out pastry thinly on lightly floured board.
Line 13 cm quiche tin with pastry.  Bake blind in a pre-heated 200'C
oven for 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Tart cases can be made
the day before then reheated in the oven before adding the filling.

To make filling: marinate juniper berries in gin for at least 12
hours. Ask the butcher to bone quail, remove legs and leave breast in
one piece. Coat quail pieces lightly in flour.  Heat butter and oil
in pan, add quail, cook for 2 minutes on each side until brown.

Pour off oil, add juniper berries, a little of the gin and a dash of
white wine Cook for a few minutes, add grapes and stock.  Cook for a
further 3 minutes over high heat.  Remove quail and grapes and put
into heated tart shell.  Reduce sauce a little if too thin, or if too
thick, add a little white wine.  Pour sauce over quail.  Garnish with
watercress. This quantity will fill one tart. Helen Spry.
