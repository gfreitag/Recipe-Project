Downside-Up Apple Pie, a double crust pie that you invert on a plate
and then you have a caramel pecan topping.

Pastry for double 9-inch crust pie

Caramel-Pecan Mixture: 3 Tbsp soft butter 1/2 c brown sugar, packed
1/2 c pecan halves

6 med tart apples 1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice 1/4 c brown sugar, packed
2 Tbsp flour 1 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp nutmeg 1/4 tsp salt

Prepare pastry and chill.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Caramel Pecan Mixture:  Cream the butter and brown sugar.  Spread
evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan.  Press the pecan halves
in an even design.

Roll out half the pastry to fit over the pecan layer, draping 1-inch
over the pie pan.

Combine the apples with lemon juice, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon,
nutmeg and salt.  Pour into the pastry.  Pack down well.

Roll out the second half of the pastry to cover the apples.  Seal
edges by folding bottom crust over top crust.  Moisten water with
edges as you go. Flute edges with a fork.  Make vents in the top.

Bake 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350F and bake 30 - 35 minutes
longer. Cool 10 minutes and invert onto a serving plate.
