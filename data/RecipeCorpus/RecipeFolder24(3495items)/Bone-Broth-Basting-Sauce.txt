Oldtime chefs call beef broth bone broth ++ too often overlooked as a
meaty-flavored ingredient in a basting sauce ++ as for them, it
started with a good soup bone.  This sauce can be used on beef or
ribs. For Lamb, make a lamb broth of lamb stew meat and bones. Yield:
4 1/2 Cups (Enough To Baste About 5 Pounds Of Meat.) 1 Tsp Salt 1 Tsp
Dry Mustard 1 Each Bay Leaf, Finely Crumbled And Stem Removed 1 Tsp
Paprika 1 Tsp Hot Pepper Sauce
Chili Powder (Or To Taste) 1/2 Tsp
1/2 Cup Worcestershire Sauce 1/2 Cup Cider Vinegar 3 Cup Beef Broth,
Tbls    Soy Sauce
Homemade If Possible 1/3 Cup Vegetable Oil 1
1 Clove Garlic, Crushed

In a stainless-steel or enamelware saucepan, blend the salt, mustard,
bay leaf, chili powder, and paprika.  Slowly stir in the pepper and
Worcestershire Sauces to dissolved the mustard, then stir in the
vinegar, beef broth, oil, soy sauce, and garlic.  Bring to a boil.
Let cool, pour into an airtight jar, cover, and refrigerate overnight
before using. Brush on beef, pork, or lamb for barbecuing. Left over
sauce takes on a smoky flavor of the meat, so some chefs thing it is
even better the next time around. Refrigerate any leftover sauce and
use within a few days or freeze. From Barbecued Ribs And Other Great
