Categories: Bread, Nuts/grains
Yield: 2 servings
2 ea Pk Dry yeast
1/2 c  Walnut Oil

Walnut Oil is essential++much cheaper in health food stores than a
gourmet shop.  Sift flour, salt and sugar into a warm bowl.  Dissolve
yeast in 1/2 cup of warm milk, and pour it into the middle of the
flour, together with the walnut oil and the rest of the milk.  Knead
well until the dough is firm and blended into a smooth, springy ball
(about 10 minutes). Leave in a warm place to rise for 2 hours or
until doubled, or in a cool place overnight.  Punch down dough and
let rise a second time.  Punch down again and mix in the walnuts and
onion, shape into rounds, and leave on a greased baking tray or in
two casserole bowls to rise for 45 min. Bake at 400 for 45 min, or
until the loaves sound hollow when tapped. Use a Pizza stone if
possible. Makes 2 loaves
