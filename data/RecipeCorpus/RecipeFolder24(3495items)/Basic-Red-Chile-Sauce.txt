Title: Basic Red Chile Sauce
Categories: Tex/mexican, Salsa/sauce, Chilies
Yield: 1 batch
-- finely chopped
1 pn Dried oregano or
1 ts Fresh oregano
1 ts Cider or white wine vinegar
8    Dried red chiles*
4 c  ;Water
2 tb Flour
2 tb Vegetable oil
2    To 3 large garlic cloves
*For a spicy sauce, use 1 New Mexico and 7 California chiles.
Eliminate the New Mexico chile for a milder sauce.

Wearing gloves, use a small knife to remove chile stems and seeds,
then wash the chiles well.  Place in a saucepan with the water and
bring to a boil over high heat; boil for 5 minutes, then allow to sit
for 10 to 15 minutes.  Whirl the water and chiles in a food processor
or blender, in batches if necessary, for 20 to 30 seconds, or until
the skins are finely chopped.  Pass through a strainer, pressing the
chile pieces through with a wooden spoon.

In a medium skillet, make a roux by combining the flour and oil.
Saute over low heat for 2 minutes, then add the garlic, chile
mixture, oregano and vinegar.  Stir well and simmer for 15 to 20
minutes. The sauce will keep in the refrigerator, tightly covered,
for about 5 days, or it can be frozen for 2 to 3 months.

Yield: Approximately 4 cups.
