Title: Cranberry Orange Muffins
Categories: Muffin, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
1 x  Equivalent of one egg (1/4 c
-fat-free egg substitute)
2 T  Nonfat yogurt, OR 2 Tbsp
-applesauce
6 oz Fresh cranberries (chopped),
-OR 1 cup dried cranberries
1/2 c  Nuts (optional!)
2 c  Flour
1/2    - 3/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 t  Baking powder
1/2 t  Baking soda
3/4 c  Orange juice
1 T  (or more!) grated orange
-zest
Mix dry ingredients (1st group) in med-large bowl. Mix wet
ingredients (2nd group) separately. Combine both groups, then add in
fruit, and nuts if desired. Bake in LIGHTLY greased/Pammed muffin pan
at 375 degrees for 20 minutes, or till firm to touch and light brown
on top. Makes 12 muffins.

This basic recipe is very flexible.  A few days ago I took out 1/4 cup
flour and added 1/2 cup wheat bran - worked fine.  I've also used
lemon juice, lemon zest, and raisins instead of the cranberries.  The
nuts can be varied or just plain omitted (my husband likes the nuts -
but to adhere to the rules of this list, you'd probably want to forgo
them). Any kind of fruit can work - raisins, chopped dates, currants,
dried cherries, dried apricots, etc.  The amount of sugar depends on
the fruit used and your individual taste - cranberries are on the
tart side. Experiment - this recipe seems to be fairly forgiving!

I'll try to remember to bring in some other muffin recipes - like
banana wheat-bran, and oat-bran raisin.
