Title: Brodo Di Pollo
Categories: Italian, Poultry, Chicken, Soup/stew
Yield: 1 batch
3 t  Salt
5    Peppercorns
1    Soupbone
3 qt Cold water
2    Egg whites (optional)
3 lb Chicken
1    Celery stalk with leaves
1    Onion
1    Carrot
4    Plum tomatoes
Put everything into a big pot over a low heat, add the water, and
bring it to a boil slowly.  Once the pot boils, scoop off the froth
that forms, cover, and reduce the heat to a simmer.  Cook for at
least 2 hours, but 3 is even better.  Strain, using a colander or
sieve lined with 2 layers of cheesecloth to catch the bits of
vegetable and bone marrow. Skim off excess fat with a bulb baster, or
chill thoroughly and remove congealed fat from the top with a spoon.
If you want a very clear broth, beat 2 egg whites lightly, bring the
defatted broth to a boil, and mix in the egg whites, beating with a
wire whisk. Boil until the particles have been absorbed by the cooked
egg whites, or for about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat, and when the
broth has settled, scoop off the now speckled egg whites with a
slotted spoon and pour the broth through a sieve lined with 2 layers
of cheesecloth. Use the boiled chicken for other soups or put it
through the meat grinder for use in filling pasta like cannelloni or
cappelletti. From The Romagnolis' Table by Margaret & G. Franco
