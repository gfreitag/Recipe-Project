Title: Baked Green Tomatoes
Categories: Casserole, Vegetable, Tomato
Yield: 24 servings
3 c  Coarse butter-cracker crumbs
2    Sticks butter
15 lg Green tomatoes
Salt and pepper
2 c  Brown sugar
Cut tomatoes in half and arrange in an oiled shallow casserole.
Season with salt and pepper and spread each with a tablespoon of
sugar. Cover with crumbs and dot with butter.  Bake at 350 F until
tender but still firm - the time will depend on the size and
greenness of the tomatoes - but will probably range from 30 to 40
minutes.

Note: 1/2" slices may be baked in this same manner.  Bake 25 minutes.
