Title: Simple Vegetable Ragout with Parsley
Categories: Side dish, Vegetable, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 lb New potatoes; sliced
Salt and pepper; to taste
1/2 lb Zucchini; sliced
1/2 lb Fresh button mushrooms
1/2 lb Shelled peas
1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
-- (heaping cup)
2 tb Chopped fresh mint
1    Or 2 tb. soy sauce (opt'l.)
3    Or 4 dried cepes or morels
1 1/2 tb Sunflower oil
1/2    To 1 lb. yellow onions
-- thinly sliced
-or-
1/2    To lb. chopped shallots
2    Garlic cloves; chopped
1/2 lb Carrots; thickly sliced
1 1/4 c  Chicken or vegetable stock
Soak the dried mushrooms in hot water until they are soft, about 20
to 30 minutes.

In a large saucepan, frying pan or wok with a cover, heat the oil and
saute the onions over medium heat until they are transparent but
still maintain their shape, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Add the garlic,
carrots, and about 1/2 c. stock.  Cover tightly and continue to cook
until the carrots are tender-crisp, about 10 minutes.

Add potatoes and cook an additional 15 minutes.  If the ingredients
seem too dry, add more stock.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Add zucchini, cover again, and cook for another 5 minutes.  Add the
fresh and dried mushrooms and the peas.  Simmer for another 5
minutes, until all the vegetables are lightly cooked.  Stir in the
parsley and mint. If desired, add soy sauce just before serving.
