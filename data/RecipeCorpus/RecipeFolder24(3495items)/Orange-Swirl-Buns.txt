Sprinkle yeast on lukewarm water in mixing bowl; stir to dissolve.

flour. Beat with electric mixer at medium speed until smooth, about 2
minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Or beat with spoon until batter
is smooth.

Gradually stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough that
leaves the sides of the bowl. Turn out on floured surface and knead
until smooth and satiny, about 10 minutes.

Place dough in greased bowl; turn over to grease top. Cover and let
rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.

Combine 1/2 cup butter, 1 1/2 cups sugar and orange rind in bowl; mix
well. Set aside.

Divide dough in half. Roll out half into 14 x 7" rectangle. Sprinkle
with 1/2 of sugar mixture. Roll up like jelly roll from long side.
Cut into 12 slices. Place in greased 13 x 9 x 2" baking pan. Repeat
with remaining dough/ Let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.

Bake in 350 degree oven 25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from
pans; cool on racks. While still warm, glaze with Thin Orange Icing.
Makes 24 rolls.

Thin Orange Icing: Combine 2 1/2 cups sifted confectioners sugar and 3
tbsp. orange juice in small bowl; beat until smooth.
