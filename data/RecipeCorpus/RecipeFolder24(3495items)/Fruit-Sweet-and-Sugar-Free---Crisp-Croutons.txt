Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Crisp Croutons
Categories: Bread
Yield: 4 cups
pn Ground black pepper
pn Salt
4 c  Cubed bread
6 T  Olive oil or melted butter
1 t  Dried ground thyme
1 T  Dried basil
1 T  Dried oregano
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Stir the herbs and seasonings into
the olive oil or melted butter. In a large bowl, drizzle the oil or
butter mixture over the cubed bread, tossing to mix well. Spread the
cubes in a single layer on a paper lined baking pan. Depending on the
dryness of the bread, bake for 10-30 minutes in the preheated oven.
Stir the croutons every 10 minutes so they brown evenly. Cool the
croutons before sprinkling on salads.

Croutons freeze well stored in plastic bags for many months. Stored
at room temperature croutons will keep for a couple of weeks.
