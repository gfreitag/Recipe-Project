-1/2-inch cubes
4 ea Cloves garlic, minced

Method: In a large pot, heat the oil until hot.  Quickly add the beef
and brown over medium heat.  Remove the meat and add the garlic and
onions. Saute the mixture until the onions are glossy.  Add the beer
and reduce by half.  Add the meat, cumin seed, chili peppers,
paprika, oregano and stock. Simmer for 45 minutes or until slightly
tender. Add the chopped peppers and continue to simmer for 20 minutes
or until tender. Optional: Shortly before serving, add the semisweet
chocolate for a surprising taste sensation. Chef's note: Adding the
peppers at the end of the cooking process can control the amount of
heat to suit one's taste. To roast cumin seed: Place 2 tablespoons
cumin seed in a saute skillet without any oil over medium heat,
shaking the pan constantly for 5 to 6 minutes. This will greatly draw
out the aroma. To roast ancho peppers: Place the dried chili peppers
on a sheet pan and place in a preheated 400' oven and roast for 12 to
15 minutes. Remove and cool. Grind in a food processor until fine.
