From Murray V.F. Jones of the New Zealand Diabetes Association "Make
sure that the eggs are fresh and at room temperature," he cautions.
"Try kiwi fruit", he suggests, as a garnish. You'll need a piece of
kitchen parchment.

1. In a bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the sweetener and
salt, and continue beating. Beat in the cornstarch, vanilla and
vinegar until soft peaks form. Work quickly, and take care not to
overbeat.

2. Rinse a piece of kitchen (grease proof) parchment with water.
Place on a baking pan.

3. Pile the egg white mixture onto the parchment in a 1 1/2 inch high
circle. Bake at 250F for 1 hour or until firm.

4. Remove from oven and cool in the pan. Invert on a platter and peel
off paper. Peel and slice the kiwis crosswise into circles, leave
some round or cut some in half. Arrange in attractive designs on the
pavlova. Cut in four portion. Serve cold.
