Yield: 6 servings
4 tb Butter; melted
3 lb Trout; dressed, OR 4 lb.

MMMMM----------------------OYSTER STUFFING---------------------------
1 tb Parsley, chopped
1 ts Salt
1/8 ts Poultry seasoning

Clean, wash, and dry the fish.  Sprinkle inside and out with salt.
Stuff fish loosely with Oyster Stuffing and sew the opening with
needle and string, or close with skewers.  Place fish in a greased
baking pan. Brush with melted butter.  Bake at 350 degrees for 40 to
60 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.  If
fish seems dry while baking, baste occasionally with drippings or
melted butter. Remove string or skewers and serve immediately on a
hot platter either plain or with a sauce.

Oyster Stuffing: Drain oysters, reserving liquor, and chop. Cook
celery and onion in butter until tender. Combine oysters, cooked
vegetables, bread cubes, and seasonings, and mix thoroughly.  If
stuffing seems dry, moisten with oyster liquour.  Yield: enough
stuffing for a 4-pound fish.
