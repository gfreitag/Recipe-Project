"A few years ago, the Chinese restaurant in the Amarin Hotel served
this dish which I copied.  The Amarin Hotel was a small hotel with
personalized services and very popular with many regular guests.  I
worked for a short time at the dress shop there.  The Amarin Hotel is
no more, there is a big modern shopping plaza in its place now.  The
shopping plaza has the first Macdonald Hamberger outlet in Thailand
situated there. It is doing very well.  I still miss the Amarin." 2
cups shredded Flank steak or beef tenderloin 1 teaspoon salt 1
tablespoon nampla (fish sauce) 1/2 cup chili cut into strips 1/2 cup
celery cut into 1 inch lengthwise 1 teaspoon Maggi sauce 1 cup oil

Marinate beef with salt and nampla for 1 hour.  Heat frying pan and
cook the salted beef (without oil) for 5 minutes.  Remove and drain
on paper towel.  Heat the oil in a wok over high heat to fry the
salted beef strips until crisp.  Drain oh paper towel.  Heat the
remaining oil. Stir-fry hot chili, shredded celery and green onion
for 1 minute.  Add fired crispy beef.  Season with Maggi sauce.  Pour
