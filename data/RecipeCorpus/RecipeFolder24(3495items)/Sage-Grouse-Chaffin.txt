Title: Sage Grouse Chaffin
Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Game
Yield: 4 servings
2    Garlic cloves, large
5 sl Bacon
3/4 c  Chicken broth
1/2 c  Vermouth, French dry
1/2    Lemon, juice only
1    Sage Grouse, cleaned and
-soaked overnight in salt
-water
1    Onion, quartered
2    Carrots, scrubbed not peeled
2    Celery ribs, leaves attached
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
2 tb Chives, finely chopped
Pan juices
1 tb Cornstarch in 2 T cold water
Soak a clay roaster. Stuff cavity of the bird with vegetables. Truss
grouse securely and place breast-side-up in the clay pot.

Lay bacon over breasts of the bird. Add liquid ingredients to the pot
and cover. Place in a cold oven. Adjust the oven temperature to 450
degrees and cook for 90 minutes. The first time you make this, you
may want to check the bird after an hour just to make sure there are
still juices in the pot.

Bring the drained pan juices to a boil and add the cornstarch/water
mixture. Add the chives and pour over the grouse.

The sage grouse will be a golden brown and so tender that you will not
believe it si a sage grouse! I serve this with steamed zucchini, rice
pilaf, a large green salad and a bottle of good burgaundy.
