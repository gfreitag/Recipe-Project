Title: Marrakesh "Pizza" (Khboz Bishemar)
Categories: Bread, Moroccan, Pizza
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  ;Lukewarm water
1 pk Active dry yeast
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
1/4 ts Ground cumin (heaping tsp.)
1    Dried red chile pepper
1 ts Paprika (heaping tsp.)
1/4 lb Mutton or beef suet
-- (about 1 cup)
-- tightly packed
3 tb Chopped parsley
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
1 ts Salt
2 c  Unbleached flour
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
4 ts Sweet butter; melted
Sprinkle the yeast over 1/4 cup lukewarm water.  Stir to dissolve and
let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes, or until the yeast has
become bubbly and doubled in volume.

Meanwhile, make the filling.  Chop or grind suet; pound the parsley,
onion and spices in a mortar or chop finely to a paste.  Mix with the
suet and set aside.

Mix the flour with the salt and make a well in the center.  Pour in
the bubbling yeast and enough lukewarm water to form a ball of dough.
(Add more water if the dough seems hard to handle.)  Knead well until
smooth and elastic, about 20 minutes.  Separate the ball of dough
into 4 equal parts.

Lightly flour a board.  Begin patting the first ball of dough down to
a disc shape, stretching and flattening it to make a rectangle
approximately 8 x 14 inches.  Spread one-quarter of the filling in
the center. Fold the right and then the left side of the dough over
the filling. Press down on this 'package' and begin flattening and
stretching it (with the filling inside) until it is the same size (8
x 14 inches) as before. Repeat the folding, this time right side over
center and left side under. Repeat with the remaining 3 balls of
dough. Set aside, covered, in a warm place for 45 minutes.

Heat the griddle.  Prick the 'packages' with a fork six or seven
times on both sides.  Place on the griddle - they will begin to fry
in the fat released from their fillings.  Fry the 'packages' 10
minutes on each side, until crisp.  Dot each package with a
teaspoonful of melted butter before serving.

Wolfert writes: "It may seem odd to stuff bread with fat and spices,
but the idea is extremely ingenious: the fat runs out through holes
pricked in the dough, becomes the medium in which the bread is fried,
and leaves behind its flavor and an array of spices and herbs that
make it taste strikingly like pizza crust."
