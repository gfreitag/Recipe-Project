Title: Peperoni Arrosto
Categories: Italian, Appetizer
Yield: 6 servings
8 T  Olive oil
Salt to taste
6 lg Up to ...
8 lg Bell peppers (any color)
2    Lemons
Gas stove:  turn the grates of the top burners upside down to cradle
the peppers and set the flame at medium high.  Put the peppers on the
grates and keep an eye on them as they roast.  As soon as one side of
a pepper is blackened, turn it a bit to the next uncharred portion.
Keep turning until all the outer skin in blackened and blistered.
Electric stove: put the peppers in the broiler, as close to the
heating element as possible, and keep turning them as they blacken.
We have to admit that this broiling process doesn't cook the peppers
as well as the gas burners: it tends to overcook them.  If, however,
you use really fresh, plump peppers, the results are good.  Roast
until the outer skin of the peppers is completely charred. Both
methods, final steps: Put the charred peppers under a cold stream of
water and peel off the black with your fingers. This makes a great
mess in the sink, but the taste of the peppers will repay you for the
cleanup.  Cut off the top stems, take out the inner seeds, and slice
the peppers lengthwise into 1/4 to 1/2 inch wide strips. Drain
briefly and put in a serving dish.  Squeeze the lemons and pour their
juice over the peppers.  Add the olive oil, and salt to taste. Baste
well. The roast peppers can be served right away, but they improve if
they marinate for half an hour or so.  From The Romagnolis' Table by
Margaret & G. Franco Romagnoli.
