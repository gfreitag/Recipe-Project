Title: Pumpkin Tea Ring
Categories: Diabetic, Dessert, Bread
Yield: 25 servings
16 oz Pumpkin; canned
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Cloves
1/2 c  Dark raisins or currents;
2 tb Margarine
2 tb Honey;
1 tb Active dry yeast;
1/4 c  Warm water
1 c  Milk; skim
1/4 c  Vegetable oil;
2 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
5 c  Whole wheat flour;
(5 1/2 c)
Soften yeast in the water.  Combine the milk, oil, and salt in a
large bowl with 2 cups of the flour.  Add yeast mixture, pumpkin,
cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and raisins.  Mix well.  Stir in 3 more
cups of flour. Beat. Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover with damp
towel, and let raise in in a warm place until doubled in bulk (about
1 hour). Punch down dough and turn onto a lightly flour surface and
knead in the remaining flour to make a smooth elastic dough, about 5
minutes. Melt the margarine and honey together in a saucepan.  Break
off 2-inch of the dough and shape into balls.  Dip the honey mixture.
Place in an oiled 10-inch tube pan. Cover and let raise until doubled
(about 1 hour). Bake in a 350 F oven for 50 to 60 minutes.  Cool 10
minutes before removing from the pan. Serve warm.
