For the Pasta: ==============

Place your flour on a work space.  Add the egg, olive oil,
water, salt and pepper.  Mix and roll the dough into a ball, then
continue working by hand until smooth and consistent.  Dust the dough
lightly with flour. Run the dough through a pasta machine to form
noodles.

Dust with flour and reserve.

For the Sauce: ==============

Melt the butter in a saute pan.  Add the mushrooms, shallot
puree, peppercorns, and bay leaves.  Reduce the mixture over high
heat for about 2 minutes.

Add chicken stock and continue cooking over medium heat for 2 to
3 minutes.

Add cream, bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce by one-third
and make it a smooth consistency.  Adjust the seasoning.

In another saute pan, add Madeira wine to 3 tablespoons of
truffles. Reduce over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes.

Strain the cream sauce into the truffles and wine, then reduce
it to a smooth consistency.

To Assemble: ============

Cook the pasta in plain boiling water, then drain.  In a saute
pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of chopped
truffles, salt, and pepper.  Add pasta to the saute pan.

Add a little cream truffle sauce and heat.

In another saute pan, saute 1 tablespoon sliced cepes, 1
tablespoon sliced shitake and 1 tablespoon of sliced chanterelle
mushrooms in 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Strain.

To serve, ladle some of the sauce onto a serving plate, swirl
pasta in the center and garnish with a quarter of the sauteed
mushrooms.  Top with chopped truffles.
