Coarsely chop shrimp into small pea-sized morsels. Toss with 1/2
teaspoon salt; set aside for 10 minutes. Combine pork, ginger, sugar,
pepper, soy sauce, sherry, sesame oil, cornstarch, green onions,
water chestnuts and remain- ing salt. Add to shrimp; mix well. Work
with 1 won ton at a time; keep the remaining skins covered with a
damp towel. Place a wrapper flat in your palm with a corner pointing
away from you and a corner pointing at you. Put about 1 heaping
teaspoon fill- ing in the top corner (a little way down from the
point). Fold the point toward you over filling. Tucking in filling,
roll corner over toward the center of the wrapper. The won ton should
look like a triangle. Pinch around filling to contain it. Place won
ton on a work surface, Using both hands, grasp the 2 op- posite.
corners of the won ton and pull them up over filling, overlapping
them a bit. Moisten overlapped edges with water; pinch to seal. Set
on a baking sheet and cover with a cloth. Repeat with remaining
ingredients. The dumplings are now ready for boiling. Or freeze them;
they'll keep for several months. Makes about 5 dozen won tons. PER 6
