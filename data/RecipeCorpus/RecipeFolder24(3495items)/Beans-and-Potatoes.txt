Title: Beans and Potatoes
Categories: Beans, Casserole, Potato
Yield: 8 servings
2    Stalks celery, chopped
Salt to taste
1 lg Sweet onion, sliced
2 c  Dried pinto beans
3 lg Potatoes, peeled and
Chopped
Cook beans until tender. That's about 20 minutes in the pressure
cooker (what a marvel of technology!). Obviously, a lot longer if you
don't have one. You could use canned beans too, if you wanted to be
quick about it.

Add potatoes and celery and cook until potatoes are tender. In the
pressure cooker that takes anywhere from 2-8 minutes, depending how
finely you chop the potatoes. I cut mine into large cubes and it took
about 4 minutes (but I live at 5500, so adjust accordingly).

Salt to taste.

Saute onion until browned. Mix in with beans and potatoes.

If you like it hot, a shot or two of hot sauce would be good.
Extremely filling!!!!

: This is adapted from *The Africa News Cookbook.* It goes MUCH
faster if you have a pressure cooker. That's what I used and you can
go from dried beans to dinner table in about an hour. :
