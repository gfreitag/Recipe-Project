Title: High Plains Jerky
Categories: Beef, Can/preserv
Yield: 6 servings
1 lb Top round steak
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
2 t  Ground dried red chile,
-preferably New Mexican or
-ancho
1 t  Onion powder
Serves 6 to 8 as a snack
1/2 c  Worcestershire sauce
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Brown sugar
4 ea Garlic cloves, minced
2 t  Fresh ground black pepper
About 2 hours before you plan to barbecue, place the meat in the
freezer to make slicing it easier.  After 30 to 40 minutes, remove
the meat from the freezer and slice it as thin as you can with a good
sharp knife. Trim the meat of all fat. Combine the marinade
ingredients in a lidded jar. Place the meat in a plastic bag or
shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Marinate for about 1
hour. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bring the temperature to 200
to 220F. Remove the meat from the refrigerator, drain it, and let it
sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the meat to a
sheet of heavy-duty foil, separating the pieces. Place the meat in
the coolest part of your smoker and cook until the meat begins to
blacken, about 45 minutes.  Wrap the foil loosely over the meat and
continue barbecuing for another 1 to 1-1/4 hours, until well-dried.
Remove the jerky from the smoker and let it cool to room temperature
before serving.  Refrigerate any leftovers. From: Smoke & Spice
