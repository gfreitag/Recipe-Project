Title: Licorice Drops
Categories: Candy, Dessert
Yield: 2 servings
1 T  (15 ml) black food colouring
1/4 t  (1 ml) anise extract or
-pulverized anise seeds
1 c  (1/4 liter) granulated sugar
1/4 c  (50 ml) brown sugar
1/4 c  (50 ml) water
1/4 c  (50 ml) light corn syrup
Put the sugars, water and corn syrup into a pot, set the pot over
medium heat and stir.  When the batch has boiled for the first time,
wash the sugar crystals down from the sides of the pot.  Put the
thermometer in the pot and cook without stirring to 290F (143C) [soft
crack stage].  Take the pot from the heat and add the food colouring
and the anise flavouring and stir them in gently. With a teaspoon,
drop round patties about the size of quarters onto a greased baking
sheet. If the candy in the pot gets too firm for spooning, reheat it
gently until it softens. Cool the drops completely but not in the
refrigerator or the pieces will stick. Wrap the drops individually in
wax paper or cellophane.
