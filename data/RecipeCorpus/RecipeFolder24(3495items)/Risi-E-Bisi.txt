Title: Risi E Bisi
Categories: Italian, Soup/stew, Rice, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
10 oz Pkg frozen peas *OR*
1 lb Fresh peas
1 c  Rice (NOT quick cooking)
1 qt Chicken broth
Grated Parmesan cheese
2    Slices prosciutto
1 sm Onion
3 T  Chopped fresh parsley
3 T  Olive oil
3 T  Unsalted butter
Cut the prosciutto in tiny squares, mince the onion, chop the
parsley. Put the oil and butter in a big, heavy pot over medium heat
and add all the chopped ingredients.  Saute until the onion is
translucent and limp. Add the peas and enough water to cover (about
1/2"), and cook for 5 minutes. Add the rice and broth, and bring to a
boil. Reduce the heat, and simmer about 15 minutes, stirring
frequently, or until the rice is tender. The soup is now very thick.
If you prefer a thinner soup, add an extra cup or two of hot broth at
this time. Serve with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese on each portion.
