Substitute fructose in recipes calling for sugar. Since it is a
natural sweetener there should be appreciable change in blood sugar
levels.
Fructose does not break down in cooking like some artificial
sweeteners.
General rule of thumb is to use 1/3 less fructose thatn the amount of
sugar called for. It can be used in all diets,but diabetics should
check with their doctors if there's any doubt about using it.
