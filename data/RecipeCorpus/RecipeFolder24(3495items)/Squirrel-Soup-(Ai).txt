Throw the squirrel's body on hot coals to singe off all the fur. Skin
the body, cut off the feet and head, clean the inside and wash the
body well. Let the body soak overnight in water to cover, to which
1/2 tsp. salt has been added. Boil about 10 minutes, then discard
this water. Boil in fresh water about 2 hours or until done, and
cool. Bone, and cut up the meat into small pieces, saving the broth.
Cut up one small onion and 1 large or 2 small potatoes and add to the
broth, Return the meat to the broth also and cook until vegetables
are done. Season to taste. This is an old-time recipe. In today's
cooking, one may add whatever vegetable you wish to the soup. SOURCE:
