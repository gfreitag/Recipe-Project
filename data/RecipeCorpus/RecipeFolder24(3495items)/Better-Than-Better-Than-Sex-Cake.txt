minutes or until golden. Cool completely. (If using a food processor,
process until ingredients are a coarse mixture.

For pudding, beat egg yolks and set aside near stove. Whisk the sugar,
flour and milk in amdeium saucepan until free of lumps. Set over
medium heat and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spatula, just
to a boil. Remove from heat and whisk a little bit of the hot, thick
pudding into the beaten egg yolks then pour the yolk mixture back
into the pudding, whisking really well. Continue to cook 1-2 minutes,
stirring constantly, until thick.

Pour pudding into bowl and add vanilla nd butter, stirring until
butter melts. If pudding has lumps, pour through a large, fine-mesh
strainer. Chill, with plastic wrap pressed directly on surface of
pudding, until ready to use.

Beat cream cheese, sugar, vanilla and lemon juice just to blend. In
seperate bowl, whip 1 cup cream to medium-stiff peaks. Fold a scoop of
whipped cream into beaten cheese then fold remaining cream into
cheese. Set aside.

caramel or chocolate sauce. Spread pudding over pineapple; spread
whipped cream evenly over pudding. Chill well.

To make glaze, melt chocolate and butter over low heat, stirring until
smooth and completely melted. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla.
