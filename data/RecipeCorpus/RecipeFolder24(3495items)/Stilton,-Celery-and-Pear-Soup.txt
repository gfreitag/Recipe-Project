The sweetness of the pears in this soup counteracts the acidity of the
Stilton.

Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the chopped onions and celery.
Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, then add the chopped
pears and the chicken stock.

Simmer gently for 20 minutes.

Cool the soup, then liquidize it, adding the crumbled Stilton. Sieve
the liquidized soup (this is the only way to get rid of the stringy
celery bits).  Pour the sieved soup into a clean pan, and season to
taste with pepper and nutmeg (with Silton no salt is needed !).
Reheat and, just before serving, stir in the chopped parsley.
