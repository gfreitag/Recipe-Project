Categories: Bread, Vegetable
Yield: 4 loaves (8
-and oil-cured ripe olives
2 T  Dried rosemary
1/2 t  Salt
1 T  Olive oil
1 pk Active dry yeast
2 c  Warm water (110F to 115F)
2 T  Sugar
4 c  Unsifted bread flour
1/2 c  Chopped and pitted green
1. In large bowl, sprinkle yeast into 1/2 C water. Stir in the sugar
and let mixlure stand until foamy-about 5 minutes.

2. With wooden spoon, beat 3 1/2 C flour, remaining 1 1/2 C water,
and the olives, rosemary, and salt into yeast mixture until combined.

3. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead dough, adding
remaining flour as necessary to prevent sticking, until smooth and
elastic-about 10 minutes.

4. Wash, dry, and lightly oil mixing bowl. Place dough in oiled bowl,
turning to bring oiled side up. Cover with clean cloth; let dough
rise in warm place until double in size-about 1 1/2 hours.

5. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets. Divide dough into quarters; shape
each quarter into 8 by 3-inch loaf. Place 2 loaves on each greased
sheet; cover loosely with clean cloth and let rise in warm place
until double in size-about 40 minutes.

6. Heat oven to 400'F. When loaves have doubled, brush tops with
olive oil. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned and loaves
sound hollow when tapped on top. Cool on wire rack at least 10
minutes before serving.
