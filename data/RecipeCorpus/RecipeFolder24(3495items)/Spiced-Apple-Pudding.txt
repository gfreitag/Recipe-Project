Title: Spiced Apple Pudding
Categories: Diabetic, Dessert, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
1/3 c  Granulated sugar substitute;
1/2 ts Cinnamon;
2 c  Unsweetened apple juice;
1/3 c  Cornstarch;
1    Egg; (or 2 yolks)
MY NOTE:  This recipe is marked in the allergy category only because
it is a pudding without milk, also low in protein. It is one of my
favorite ways to use up egg yolks or prepare a dessert when I've run
out of milk. Probably does not require as much sweetening as stated
in the recipe - start with 2 Tbsp. sweetener and add more if
necessary. Cost to make the whole recipe is around $1.22.

In a heavy saucepan, combine 1/2 cup apple juice and cornstarch; mix
well. Add remaining juice.  Place over medium heat and cook,
stirring, until mixture comes to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for
2 minutes. Remove from heat.

In a bowl, beat egg with a fork.  Add 1/2 cup of hot mixture to
beaten egg. Stir until smooth.  Return immediately to hot mixture,
stirring constantly. (The hot mixture will cook the egg.)

Stir in sweetener and cinnamon.  Pour into 4 dessert dishes, cover
with plastic wrap to prevent skin from forming.  Cool to room
temperature or chill in refrigerator.

If you prefer to use real sugar, mix 2 TBSP with the apple juice in
the saucepan.  Divide the cooked pudding into 6 small dishes so that
there is approx. 1 tsp sugar per serving if you are allowed this much
on your meal plan.  94 calories, 21 grams carbohydrate estimated.
