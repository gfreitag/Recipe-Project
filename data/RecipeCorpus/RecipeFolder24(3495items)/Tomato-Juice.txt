Yield: 1 servings
No Ingredients Found
Wash and drain, firm, fresh, red ripe tomatoes. (One small decayed
spot can cause the whole batch to spoil.)  Remove core and blossom
ends. Leave tomatoes whole and bake in oven, or cut into small pieces
and cook slowly (simmer) until soft, stirring often.  Press through a
fine sieve or food mill.  Salt, sugar and spices, to taste, may be
added to the juice. Reheat juice until it is almost, but not quite
boiling. Pour hot, into hot jars, leaving 1/4 inch (6 mm) head space.
Adjust caps. Process pints 35 minutes, quarts 45 minutes in boiling
water bath. From: Ball Blue Book Shared By: Pat Stockett
