Title: Corn Griddle Cakes
Categories: Bread, Breakfast
Yield: 1 servings
2 T  Sugar
1/2 t  Salt (we use less)
2    Eggs, separated
3/4 c  Sour milk
2 T  Margarine, melted
2 c  Corn kernals (whole, not
-creamed)
1/2 c  Corn meal
1/2 c  Flour
1/2 t  Baking powder
1/2 t  Baking soda
Method:

Sift together the dry ingredients and add to the corn.  Stir in
beaten egg yolks, then the sour milk, then the melted margarine.
Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold in.  Cook on a hot, greased
griddle until nicely browned on both sides, turning once.  Serve with
molasses or syrup.

NOTE:   This makes a thin-ish batter that looks a lot different from
the pancake batter that you're probably used to.  Make sure you stir
the batter to stir up the corn kernals before pouring out onto the
griddle.
