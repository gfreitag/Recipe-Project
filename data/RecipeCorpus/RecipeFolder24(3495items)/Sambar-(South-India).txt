STORY One reason the food of southern India is different from that of
northern India is that for much of the year, the climate of the south
is hotter. So eating less sunstantial foods with spices like chilies
and ginger, which induce sweating, is a practical way to keep cool.
The nutritious bean and rice pancakes called DOSA play an important
role in the cuisine of southern India. Here they accompany SAMBAR, a
simple stew, flavored with masala paste, coconut milk and tamarind
concentrate. Serve with spicy chutney and a fresh mango for dessert.

This aromatic stew goes well with any starchy food. For an authentic
flavor use asafetida (a resin with a taste of garlic) and tamarind (a
tart brown fruit) -- both available from Indian food shops.

DIRECTIONS:

For COCONUT MILK, combime coconut and boiling water in a blender or
food processor. Run at high speed for 5 minutes. Let rest until cool
enough to handle (about 20 minutes). Line a colander with chessecloth
or nylon sheer material. Pour cooled coconut mixture into cloth and
drain. Squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Discard fibrous pulp.

For COOKED PEAS, bring split peas, tumeric and coconut milk to a
simmer. Stir at first to prevent sticking. Simmer until peas have
softened (about 45 minutes).

For MASALA PASTE, toast mustard, cumin and coriander seeds in a deep
frying pan until popping. Put in a blender or food processor with
butter, ginger, chili and asafetida. Blend until smooth, scraping
down sides as necessary. Fry masala paste on low heat until aromatic
(about 10 minutes).

To ASSEMBLE STEW, stir the fried masala mixture, okra, tamarind and
salt into cooked peas. Simmer until okra has softened (about 5
minutes). Serve immediately, or let cool and reheat. Serve over DOSA
and garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves.

Makes 2 cups - 20 minutes preparation - 30 minutes cooling - 1 hour
