Remove fat,muscle & any gristle from meat. Cut in 1/2 lengthwise.
Slice each piece crosswise, against the grain & on a slight slant, so
you have 1/4-in. slices. Place in bowl & marinate for 1 hr. in soy
sauce,sherry,egg,salt,pepper & cornstarch. Heat a wok hot & dry. Add
oil. When it's just beginning to smoke,add meat mixture, stirring it
quickly so the pieces separate. After 1 min.,drain through a colander
or sieve, reserving 2-3 tbs. oil. Prepare the Imperial Sauce. Return
reserved oil to the wok. Add mushrooms,bamboo
shoots,ginger,garlic,snow peas & meat. Move wok back & forth rapidly
in the air so the vegetables are flipped into the air continuously.
Add Imperial Sauce & continue flipping vegetables & meat 3 min. or
until the sauce thickens. If desired,sprinkle a few drops of sesame
oil on mixture. Serve. Don't mistake Oriental for American sesame
oil. They are totally different. Effort: AVERAGE Time: 01:40 Source:
