Title: Mustard, German-Style
Categories: Salsa/sauce, German, Condiment, Herbs/spice, Spread
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Salt
2    Cl garlic
Minced or pressed
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Ground allspice
1/4 ts Dried tarragon leaves
1/8 ts Turmeric
1/4 c  Yellow mustard seed
2 tb Black or brown mustard
Seed, heaping
1/4 c  Dry mustard
1/2 c  Water
1 1/2 c  Cider vinegar
1    Small onion chopped
2 tb Firmly packed brown sugar
In a small bowl, combine mustard seed and dry mustard.  In a 1- to
2-quart non-aluminim pan, combine remaining ingredients.  Simmer
uncovered, on medium heat until reduced by half, 10-15 minutes. Pour
the mixture into the mustard mixture.  Let mixture soak at room
temperature 24 to 48 hours, adding additional vinegar if neccesary in
order to maintain enough liquid to cover seeds.

Process the seeds and mixture in a blender or food processor until
pureed to the texture you like --this can take at least 3 or 4
minutes. Some prefer whole seeds remaining, others a smooth paste.
The mixture will thicken considerably upon standing.  If it gets too
thick after a few days,stir in additional vinegar.

Scrape mustard into clean, dry jars; cover tightly and age at least 3
days
