"Few people think of roasting summer vegetables in the oven, yet high
heat keeps them juicy and flavorful. Lightly seasoned with herbs and
a touch of olive oil, this dish cooks quickly and is excellent either
served hot, at room temperature or cold."

Preheat oven to 425F. In a large bow, toss together peppers, onions,
squash, garlic, olive oil, oregano, salt and pepper. Spread the
vegetables on a baking sheet or metal roasting pan and roast for 20
minutes, or until tender, stirring several times. Transfer to a
serving bowl and cool slightly. Add parsley and vinegar and toss
until mixed. Taste and adjust seasonings. SERVES: 6
