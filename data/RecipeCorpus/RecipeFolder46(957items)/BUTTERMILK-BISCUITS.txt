Title: BUTTERMILK BISCUITS
Categories: Breads, Cookies
Yield: 30 Servings
4 c  Flour
2 tb Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 tb Sugar
2/3 c  Butter, softened
1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
1/4 c  Butter
Sift flour with baking powder, soda, salt, and sugar. Cut in 2/3 cup
butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add buttermilk, stirring
until dry ingredients are moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly
floured surface; knead lightly 4 or 5 times.  Roll dough to 1/2 inch
thickness; cut with a 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter. Place biscuits on a
lightly greased baking sheet. Brush tops with 1/4 inch melted butter.
Bake at 450 F for 8 minutes or until golden brown.

Note:  When cutting biscuits, never twist the cutter; that will seal
the edges and prevent proper rising. If the cutter is not cutting all
the way, consider a new cutter.
