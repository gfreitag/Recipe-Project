2/3 c  Buttermilk
1/3 c  Olive oil
1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
1/4 c  Mayonnaise
3 tb Garlic chives; snipped
1 ts Fresh minced tarragon
2 ts Coarsely ground green
-- peppercorns
1/2 ts Salt (approximately)
1/4 ts Sugar
Whisk buttermilk, olive oil, lemon juice and mayonnaise in a small
bowl until mixture is smooth and well blended. Blend in remaining
ingredients. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate
for at least 30 minutes.  Correct seasoning and allow to come to cool
room temperature before serving.

Yield: About 1 1/2 c. dressing.

Belsinger and Dille write: "This tangy dressing goes well with all
kinds of salad greens and is especially good with cucumbers and
summer-ripe tomatoes.  Pour it over steamed and sliced new potatoes
for a delicious warm potato salad.  Coarsely crack the peppercorns in
a mortar and pestle or use the flat side of a chef's knife to crack
them on a cutting board. The dressing will keep, in a tightly covered
jar, in the refrigerator for about a week."
