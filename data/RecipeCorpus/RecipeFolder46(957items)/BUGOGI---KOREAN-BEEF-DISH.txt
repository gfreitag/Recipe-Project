Title: BUGOGI - KOREAN BEEF DISH
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Beef tenderloin,
-sliced very thin
2    Cloves fresh garlic, crushed
2 tb Granulated sugar
1 tb Sesame oil
Black pepper good sprinkling
Roasted sesame seeds
-(also a good sprinkling)
1    Green onion, finely chopped
2 tb Soy sauce
3 tb Water
In a glass or plastic bowl, mix everything together. Cover and
refrigerate for 1-2 days.  (You can cook immediately, but of course,
it won't taste as good.
:-) )

In a skillet, heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium-high to
high heat.  Cook the beef slices, turning until meat reaches desired
degree of doneness (about 1-2 minutes).

Serve with rice and green vegetables.

NOTES:  The recipe says 'serves four,' but then again, I ate a batch
of this myself without complaining too much. I guess it depends on
how hungry you are and what else you're serving. ;-)

I also usually omit the sesame seeds, since neither my SO nor I like
them. Hasn't killed me yet.

I got this recipe from the Atlanta Journal/Constitution, near
Christmas (it was part of a list of dishes that the paper's
contributors served at their own Christmas dinners; they had a Cuban
writer, someone Russian, etc. I do not recall the name of the South
Korean woman whose recipe this is, alas).
