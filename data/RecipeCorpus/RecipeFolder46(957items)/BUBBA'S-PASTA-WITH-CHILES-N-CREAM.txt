Your favorite chile(s)
-julliened
2 tb Olive oil
Juice and zest of 1 lemon
1 ts Salt
While water for pasta is heating up to rolling boil, prepare onion and
chile(s). Zest lemon. Roll around counter top while gently pressing
down with your palm. Slice and squeeze. reserve zest and juice. Heat
saut pan over med. high heat add oil. Add onion and saut till onion
starts to turn translucent. (Water should be at a boil by now, so add
pasta.) Add you chile and continue cooking till onions just start to
caramelize. Add cream and cook approximately 2 more minutes. Add
juice to cream mixture and 1/2 of the jest reserving rest for
garnish. (This is the only tricky part-if you add the juice and the
cream at the same time the cream will break or curddle but will not
if the cream is cooked a bit first) Stir frequently, let sauce cook
and thicken some. Pasta should be cooked. Drain well and toss with
cream sauce add salt. You can use dry pasta but the timing will be
off so adjust accordingly. As I said, very fast and cheap. The sweet
of the onion and the heat of the chile plus the play against the
cream and the texture of the chile against the pasta makes this dish
superb. I hope you will enjoy. Walt - MM Chile-Heads
