Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Granulated sugar
3 tb To 5 Tbsp cold water
pn Salt
1/2 c  Cold butter
1.  Blend flour, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl. Cut butter
into 1/2-inch cubes and add to flour mixture. Using a pastry blender
or 2 knives, cut butter into dry mixture until it is the consistency
of coarse meal.

2.  Gradually sprinkle 3 tablespoons water over flour mixture, using
a fork to work liquid into flour.  Then work in just enough remaining
water so dough can be gathered into a firm ball.

3.  Flatten ball slightly with the palm of your hand. Wrap pastry and
refrigerate at least until chilled, about 30 minutes. Pastry will
keep well in the refrigerator for several days. It also freezes well.
