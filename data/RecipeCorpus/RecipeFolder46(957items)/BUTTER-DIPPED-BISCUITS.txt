Title: BUTTER-DIPPED BISCUITS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 18 Servings
1/4 c  Butter
1 1/4 c  Unbleached All Purpose
Flour
2 ts Sugar
2 ts Baking Powder
1/2 ts Salt
2/3 c  Milk
Heat the oven to 450 degrees F.  Heat the butter in a square pan 9 X
9 X 2-inches, in the oven until the butter is melted. Mix the flour,
sugar, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Add the milk and stir
with a fork just until a soft dough forms, about 30 strokes. Turn the
dough out onto a well-floured cloth-covered board. Coat the dough
lightly with flour. Knead lightly about 10 times. Roll or pat the
dough into an 8-inch square. With a floured butter knife, cut the
dough into halves, then cut each half into 9 strips.  Dip each strip
into the melted butter, coating both sides. Arrange the strips close
together in two rows in the pan. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until
golden brown.
