1/3 c  Olive oil

Cook rice in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender,
about 30 minutes.  Drain well.  Let cool to room temperature.

Combine 1/4 cup oil, 2 tablespoons soy sauce and 2 tablespoons
Worcestershire sauce; pour over zucchini and onion slices in a shallow
dish.  Let marinate 30 minutes, turning vegetables over once during
this time.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  When coals turn white, drain
mesquite chips (if using) and scatter over coals. When chips begin to
smoke, place onion and zucchini on grill, seasoning with salt and
pepper. Cover and cook until tender and brown (about 8 minutes),
turning occasionally and brushing with marinade. Remove vegetables
from grill. Cut onion slices into quarters and zucchini into 1-inch
pieces. Place in a serving dish with cooled rice and corn.

Whisk together orange juice, lemon juice, 1/3 cup oil, 3 tablespoons
soy sauce and 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce. Pour 1 cup of
dressing over salad and toss to combine.  Stir in parsley and season
with salt and pepper.  Serve salad with additional dressing on the
side.
