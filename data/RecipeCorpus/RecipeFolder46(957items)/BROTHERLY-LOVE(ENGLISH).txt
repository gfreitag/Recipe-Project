Title: BROTHERLY LOVE(ENGLISH)
Categories: Cakes, English
Yield: 1 Cake
1 lb Flour
1 ts Salt
2 oz Lard
1/2 oz Yeast
1 ds Caster sugar
1/2 pt Warm water
2 oz Granulated sugar
Set oven to 425/F or Mark 7. Mix the flour and salt together, then
rub in 1 oz. of the lard. Cream the yeast with the sugar and stir in
the water and allow to sponge. lVlake a well in the flour and add the
yeast mixture. Mix well then turn out on to a lightly floured
surface. Knead, then cover and leave in a warm place until the dough
has doubled in bulk. Knead again, then roll out into an oblong 1/2
inch thick. Flake the remaining lard and dot evenly over the dough,
then sprinkle the sugar over. Roll up like a Swiss Roll, put on to a
greased baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes. When removed from the
oven brush the top with a little milk while warm to give a sheen. An
alternative way of baking Brotherly Love is to cut the `Swiss Roll'
into 1 inch slices and put on a greased baking sheet to cook for 30
minutes.
