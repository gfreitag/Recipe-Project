spray. Add celery, onion, carrot, and thyme; cover and cook, stirring
occasionally, over low heat, until tender, 10 minutes. Add broth and
rice; bring to boil and simmer 10 minutes.

4. Transfer to blender in small batches and carefully blend until
smooth. Return soup to pot.  Stir in asparagus, green onions,
parsley, soy sauce, pepper sauce, and pepper to taste; return to
simmer. Ladle into bowls and garnish with reserved asparagus tips and
parsely springs. Makes 7 cups.
