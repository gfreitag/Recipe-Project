Title: BROWN & SERVE ROLLS (KH)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
9    To 10 cups all-purpose
Flour
1 tb Salt
2 c  Warm water
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Milk
2 pk Active dry yeast
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
Stir together 3 cups flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large mixer
bowl Heat water, milk, and butter until very warm (120 to 130F). Add
liquid ingredients to flour mixture; beat until smooth, about 3
minutes on high speed of electric mixer. Gradually stir in enough
more flour to make a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface;
knead until smooth and elastic (5 to 8 minutes). Shape dough into a
ball, place in an oiled bowl, and turn to oil top of dough. Cover;
let rise in a warm place until double in bulk (30 to 45 minutes).
Punch dough down. Divide in half. Shape each half into rolls. Let
rise in a warm place until double in bulk (30 to 45 minutes). Bake at
375F 20 to 25 minutes, or just until rolls begin to change color.
Cool in pans 20 minutes. Finish cooling on wire racks. Wrap tightly
in plastic bags and refrigerate up to 1 week, or freeze up to 2
months. Before serving, place rolls on ungreased baking sheet. Bake
at 400F 10 to 12 minutes.
