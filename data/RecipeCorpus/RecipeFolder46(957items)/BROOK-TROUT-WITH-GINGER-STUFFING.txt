Title: BROOK TROUT WITH GINGER STUFFING
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Boneless brook trout
-- about 1/2 lb. each
-- with the heads on
1/4 lb Peeled and deveined shrimp
-- cut into small pieces
1/4 c  Heavy cream
1 tb Grated fresh ginger
1    Be chopped shallots
1 ds Tabasco
Salt
Freshly ground white pepper
4 tb Milk
4 tb Flour for dredging
2 tb Vegetable oil
4 tb Butter
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
4 sl Lemon
2 tb Chopped parsley
1.  Place the shrimp, cream, ginger, shallots, Tabasco and salt and
pepper to taste in the bowl of a food processor. Start blending,
puree until the mixture is smooth and thick. This should take about
30 to 40 seconds.

2.  Open the brook trout, divide the stuffing in four equal portions
and spread the mixture evenly on the right fillet of the open trout.
Fold the left fillet to enclose the stuffing.

3.  Pour the milk in a shallow platter and mix the flour with salt and
pepper onto a flat dish. Dip each trout in the milk, remove excess and
dredge in the flour mixture, patting to be sure the flour adheres.

4.  Heat the oil in a non-stick skillet large enough to hold the
trout in one layer without crowding. Add the trout and brown
thoroughly on one side. Then turn the trout with a spatula on the
other side, the process should take about 4 `minutes on side
depending on the thickness of the trout. While the fish is browning
on the second side, baste the top with hot oil from the pan to
prevent them from drying out. Transfer to a warm platter, keep warm.

5.  While the pan is still warm, wipe it out with a paper towel and
return it to medium heat to melt the butter and cook until the butter
is a hazelnut color. Add the lemon juice, pour and divide the butter
over the trout. Garnish with the lemon slices and sprinkle the
parsley over all. Serve very hot.
