Use buns for small pie shells. For cocktail parties, use smaller
rolls. Split in half and hollow into shells by removing part of the
soft inside crumbs with the point of a sharp knife. Brush with
butter. Sprinkle with a little plain or cinnamon sugar for sweet
fillings; leave plain or dust with Parmesan cheese for salty
fillings. Arrange on a baking sheet and bake at 350~ until golden and
crisp, about 20 to 25 minutes. To serve hot; reheat in the oven,
empty and fill with a hot filling just before serving. Source:
