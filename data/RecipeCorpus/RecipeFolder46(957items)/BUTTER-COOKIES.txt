Title: BUTTER COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 2 Dozen
1/2 c  Butter (unsalted),
-at room temperature
1/2 c  Sugar, granulated
1 1/2 c  Flour, white
1 lg Egg
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
Beat the butter with the sugar.  Add the egg and vanilla and beat
until you get a uniform mixture.  Mix the flour and baking powder and
gradually blend them into the mixture. When you're done, you should
have a rather sticky dough.

Shape the dough into balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Roll them in
sugar and place them on an ungreased cookie sheet, leaving about an
inch of space between cookies, so that they don't stick together when
they expand.

Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes. Remove from
oven, let them cool for a while, and start eating right away.

NOTES:

*  After reading the ingredients on a can of imported Danish butter
cookies, I thought: "Hey! I can do this myself!", so I developed the
following recipe. It doesn't resemble the original too much, but
considering that the cookies don't stay around for more than two
days, and that even my mother liked them, they must be good! Yield:
Makes 2-3 dozen cookies.

: Difficulty:  Easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 20 minutes baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.
