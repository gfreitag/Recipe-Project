In large bowl, mix two flours and salt.  Add eggs and milk; blend to
form a medium soft dough.  Knead dough on a floured board for a few
minutes. Place dough into a sealed container or zipper-top plastic
bag; let rest for about 20 minutes.  Cut dough into 12 or 16 pieces,
depending upon pretzel size you prefer.  Roll each piece into a rope
and a twist into desired shape. Place pretzels on a lightly oiled
baking sheet; brush with egg white. Sprinkle with salt, sesame or
poppy seeds. Bake at 425d for 15-20 minutes. Serve warm.

Makes 12-16 pretzels.
