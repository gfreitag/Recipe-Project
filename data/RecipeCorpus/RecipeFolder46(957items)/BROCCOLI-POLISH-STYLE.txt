The simple device of topping cooked broccoli with chopped hard-boiled
egg and fried breadcrumbs makes a light, appetizing meal served with
buttered rice and either a side vegetable dish or a tossed salad.

Lay the broccoli spears in a warm dish and season them with salt and
pepper. Sieve the egg yolk and chop the white finely. Mix with the hot
breadcrumbs and strew over the warm broccoli. Heat through for 5
minutes at 180 degrees C / 350 degrees F / gas 4 and serve warm.
