Categories: Alcohol, Mixed drink, Beverages
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Part Malibu Rum
1    Part Bacardi Rum
1    Part Kahlua
1    Part Creme de Cacao
1    Part Coco Lopez
1    Part Bailey's Irish Cream
Put all ingredients in blender, add ice and blend. I find that
putting the Kahlua in after all the others have been blended and then
mix in the Kahlua seems to keep it from frothing up. Serve in a tall
glass with a straw. Top with whipped cream if desired, but not
necessary.
