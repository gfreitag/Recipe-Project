Title: BROCCOMOLE (MCDOUGALL)
Categories: Digest, Jan., Mcdougall
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Cooked broccoli stems, tough
Outer layers peeled off
1 1/2 tb Fresh-sqeezed lemon juice
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1/8 ts Garlic powder
1/2    Tomato, diced
1    Scallion, sliced
1    Canned green chili, chopped
In a food processor, blend the broccoli stems with the lemon juice,
cumin, and garlic powder until completely smooth. Add the remaining
ingredients and mix well by hand, but do not blend. Chill before
serving for best flavor.

Note:the above was copied directly from the book.  I doubled the
recipe. I also used a fresh green chili instead of canned, which I
don't think I can get over here. It was very tasty, but do not expect
it to taste like avocado.  Think of it as a really good broccoli dip,
and not necessarily as a replacement for something else. Everyone at
my party the other night enjoyed it.
