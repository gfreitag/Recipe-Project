Title: BUTTERFLY COOKIES
Categories: Chinese, Cookies, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Package won ton wrappers
1 c  Powdered sugar
Oil for deep frying
Fixed these guys last night.  Good stuff!  Quite simple to do. I also
tried using granulated sugar and cinnamon as well as the powdered
sugar. All were equally good.

Yield: About 80

PREPARATION: Cut each won ton wrapper into 2 rectangles. Lay one
rectangle on top of the other to form a double thickness. Make three
1/2-inch slits in the center, lengthwise. To form a bow, pull one end
through the middle slit.

COOKING: Deep fry butterflies until golden, about 1 minute or less.
Drain on paper towel. Sift powdered sugar over both sides. Cool.

DO-AHEAD NOTES: These keep several weeks in air-tight containers. [Fat
chance! They didn't even make it through the next day! S.C.]

COMMENTS: These can also be made from egg roll wrappers but they're
three times as large.  I prefer using won ton wrappers because I
think their mini size makes them more attractive.
