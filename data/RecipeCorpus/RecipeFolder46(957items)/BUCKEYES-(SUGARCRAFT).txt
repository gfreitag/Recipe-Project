Title: BUCKEYES (SUGARCRAFT)
Categories: Candies
Yield: 20 Servings
1/4 lb Margerine
1 c  Peanutbutter
3/4 lb Powdered sugar
1 lb Dipping chocolate*
Combine ingredients thoroughly. Roll into 1-inch balls and turn onto
wax paper-covered cookie sheet. May need to let set awhile or chill.
Melt dipping chocolate (*avail. Sugarcraft) in top of double boiler
or in microwave on 50%.    Don't have chocolate hotter than 120
degrees! Drop a ball of candy into chocolate, leave top uncoated.
With a table fork dipped under the ball, lift it and let the excess
chocolate run off of it. Place it on the wax paper covered cookie
sheet, using a toothpick to hold the ball so fork can be removed.
Store tightly covered in a cool dry place. Will keep 3-6 weeks.
