Combine all ingredients in the top of a double boiler, beating with a

water, beat constantly with rotary egg beater, and cook 7 minutes, or

beat until thick.  Makes enough for tops and sides of two 9-inch
layers. To make Burnt sugar syrup, place 1/2 cup sugar in heavy
skillet over medium flame. Stir constantly as sugar melts, then
becomes dark mahogany color, and smokes noticeably. Remove at once
from fire, add VERY SLOWLY 1/3 cup hot water, and stir until
dissolved.
Cool.  Measure 1 1/2 to 2 Tablespoons for frosting.
Store remaining burnt sugar syrup in a jar to use for cakes and
frostings. Kate Smith Collection  Published 1940 by General Foods
