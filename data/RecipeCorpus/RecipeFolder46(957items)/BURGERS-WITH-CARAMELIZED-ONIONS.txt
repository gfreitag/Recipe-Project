Categories: Vegetarian, Burgers
Yield: 8 Servings
1/3 c  Bulgur
2 ts Olive oil

In a small bowl, combine bulgur with 1/2 cup warm water; let stand
for 30 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the bulgur is
tender. Prepare the Harvest Burger in a medium bowl. Set aside while
it absorbs water.

Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over low heat. Add
onions and sugar; saute until the onions are very tender and golden,
about 15 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup water and vinegar. Season with salt
and keep warm.

Prepare a grill or preheat the broiler. Combine the Harvest Burger
and bulgar in the same bowl. Add tomato paste, parsley, salt and
pepper; mix thoroughly but lightly. Shape into 8 patties. Grill or
broil on a lightly oiled rack until browned and cooked through, about
5 minutes per side. Place the patties on buns, top with the
caramelized onions, and garnish with lettuce. Serves 8
