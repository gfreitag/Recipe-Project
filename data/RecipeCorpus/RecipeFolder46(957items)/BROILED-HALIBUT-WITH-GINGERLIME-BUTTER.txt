*** BROILED HALIBUT WITH
GINGER-LIME BUTTER ***
6 tb Unsalted butter, softened
2 tb Chopped chives
Juice of 2 limes
2 ts Grated lime rind
1 ts Grated fresh ginger
1/2 ts Chopped fresh thyme leaves,
Or 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
Coarse salt and freshly
Ground black pepper to
Taste
4    Halibut steaks
Chopped parsley for garnish
First make the butter.  Using an electric beater, if available, and a
warm bowl, beat the butter for a couple of minutes to make it fluffy.
Gradually add  the chives, lime juice, lime rind, ginger, and thyme.
Season with salt and pepper and mix well.  Form the butter into a
ball, wrap it in aluminum foil, and refrigerate. Use the freezer
compartment if you are making the butter within 2  hours of serving
the fish, so that the butter is not too soft. Pat the fish steaks dry
with paper towels.  Season them with salt and pepper and wrap them in
buttered foil.  Broil over hot coals or under high heat for 5 to 7
minutes on each side, depending on the thickness of the fish. Test
for doneness by opening the foil and seeing if the fish flakes when
prodded with a fork. Arrange the fish on individual serving plates.
Cut the butter in neat, even slices and place them on the fish
steaks. Garnish with parsley and serve.

Yield:  4 servings.
