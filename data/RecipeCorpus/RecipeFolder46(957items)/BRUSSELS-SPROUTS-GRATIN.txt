Title: BRUSSELS SPROUTS GRATIN
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Brussels sprouts
2 oz Bacon
1 tb Unsalted butter
- for greasing gratin dish
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 tb Fresh bread crumbs
4 tb Unsalted butter; in bits
PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Prepare the brussels sprouts by cutting a thin
slice off the root end of each and then cutting an X in that end so
it cooks evenly inside and out. In a large pot of boiling, salted
water, blanch sprouts until they are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.
Drain, refresh in ice cold water, and drain again. (Do not let the
sprouts sit in water for more than a minute.) Saute bacon until limp,
not crisp. Drain and coarsely chop. Mix the sprouts and bacon
together and spread the mixture in a buttered gratin dish. Pour cream
over the sprouts-bacon mixture and dot with bread crumbs and butter.
Bake for 20 minutes or until hot.
