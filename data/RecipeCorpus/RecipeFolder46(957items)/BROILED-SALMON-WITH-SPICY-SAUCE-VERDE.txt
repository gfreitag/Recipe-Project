Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
4    Green New Mexican chilies
-or:
1/2 sm Green bell pepper plus:
2    Jalapenos
2 ts Chopped scallions, including
-green tops
2 ts Vegetable oil
3 tb Green peppercorns in brine,
-drained
2 ts All-purpose white flour
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/4 c  Skim milk
1 tb Hot-pepper sauce, preferably
-habanero chili sauce
1 tb Chopped fresh dill
4    Salmon steaks, 6 oz each
Note: In place of the fresh chilies, you can use canned green ones,
which do not need to be roasted and peeled. Drain them well.

Preheat broiler. On a foil-lined baking sheet, broil peppers for 7 to
8 minutes, or until blackened, turning once. Place in a paper bag and
set aside until cooled. Remove skin, stems and seeds. Chop finely.

In a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat, saute scallions in oil
for 2 minutes until softened. Add green peppercorns and saute for 2
minutes more. Add flour and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
Stir in wine and milk and blend well. Add chilies, hot-pepper sauce
and dill. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer about 5
minutes, or until the sauce has been reduced and thickened.

Broil salmon for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until fish flesh is
opaque. Remove the skin from the steaks before serving. Place some of
the sauce on a plate and place the salmon on top of it.
