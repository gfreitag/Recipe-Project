Title: BROILED SESAME TROUT
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Serving size rainbow trout
Or other locally available
Trout, pan-dressed
1/2 c  Lemon juice
4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Sesame seed
3/4 c  Butter or margarine
With a sharp knife, make 3 light slashes on each side of fish,
without cutting flesh too deep.
In a 13" by 9" baking pan, mix lemon juice, salt and pepper. Add
fish and turn over to coat with marinade. Cover; refrigerate at least
3 hours turning occasionally.
In a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat, toast sesame seed until
golden, stirring and shaking pan occasionally. Add butter or
margarine and heat until melted.
Place fish on rack in broiling pan.  Drain marinade from baking pan
into sesame seed mixture.  Preheat broiler if manufacturer directs.
Broil fish about 5 minutes on each side, basting frequently with
sesame seed mixture.
Test fish for doneness with a fork.  Trout are cooked when their
flesh flakes easily.
With pancake turners or spatulas, lift fish carefully onto warm
platter and spoon hot juices over it. The Good Housekeeping
Illustrated Cookbook, Hearst Books, NY, 1980. Carving a Whole Fish
With a sharp knife, cut the top side of fish into servings, just down
to the bone.
Carefully ease cooked meat away from the rib bones; lift one section
and place it on warmed plate.  Repeat with remaining sections.
Lift off all bones and carve the lower section in the same way. (If
the fish is stuffed, remove stuffing after cutting top of fish and
before removing bones to serve lower portion.)
