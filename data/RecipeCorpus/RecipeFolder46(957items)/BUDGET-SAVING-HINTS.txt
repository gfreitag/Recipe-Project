Title: BUDGET SAVING HINTS

Yield: 1 Servings

(1) Buy whole chickens and cut it up.  You'll save 30 ~ 40 percent
over pre-cut chicken.

(2) For beef and pork always buy the family pack. Again about a 15%
savings. (3) Pasta !!! Cheap and really versitile. Always have lots on
hand. Lasagna can be especially good. Make a big one, cut it into
meal size individual portions and freeze them.

(4) Rice !!!  Again cheap and you can do a lot with it. Take 2 cups
of rice steam, when done scramble 3 eggs, throw in some green onions
and any left over chicken scraps (when butchering a chicken there's
always little bits and pieces kicking aroud), add the rice, some soy
sauce and fry it on up.

(5) Stir fries.  Lots of inexpensive veggies and some meat.

For 4 and 5 you don't need a wok just a big fry pan. A wok is nice
but not really needed.

(6) Always have something like Kraft Dinner, etc. on hand for those
nights you really don't fell like cooking for yourself. As a bachelor
or bachelorette sometimes it's a real drag to cook but for health
reasons you should eat something.

(7) A microwave is a must.  You can pick up a little one for no more
than $80 dollars.  They really help for defrosting and heating
leftovers
