Title: BROWN JASMINE RICE SALAD
Categories: Digest, August
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
1/2 c  Chopped
Cilantro
6    Thin ginger slices (I used
More)
2 tb Fresh lime juice
1/2 c  Soy sauce
2 1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Honey or brn. sugar
MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
3 c  Cooked and cooled Wild Blend
Rice (I used Lundberg
Blend)
3 c  Cooked and cooled Basmati
Rice (these can be cooked
Together)
1 ts Ground chilli (I used
Cayenne pepper)
1 c  Green beans thinly sliced
Steamed and cooled
1 c  Snow peas, thinly sliced
1    Cucumber thinly sliced and
Quartered
1 c  Bean sprouts
1 c  Finely diced orange
1 c  Finely diced tart apple
Chunks
1 cn Sliced water chestnuts
1/2 c  Chopped cilantro
1 1/2 tb Lime juice
Sauce: Combine sauce ingredients in saucepan, bring to rolling boil.
Reduce heat, simmer until sauce is consistency of maple syrup, about
20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.

My personal preference is to half the soy sauce, water and honey or
brn. sugar.  You may want to experiment by making a whole batch and
adding it to the salad to suit your preference. I used a considerable
amount more cilantro, lime, and ginger than the recipe calls for but
I love spicy things.

Combine salad ingredients, drizzle sauce over and toss gently. Chill
and serve.
