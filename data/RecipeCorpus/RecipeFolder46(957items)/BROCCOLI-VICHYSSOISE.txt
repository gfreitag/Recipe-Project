Categories: Soups, Potatoes
Yield: 8 Servings
4    Medium-size leeks (about 1
-pound)
2 ts Non-diet, tub style
-margarine
3 1/4 c  Chicken stock or broth
-(defatted), divided
3 1/2 c  Peeled and diced potatoes
-(1-1/2 pounds)
3 c  Broccoli florets
1/4 ts White pepper
1 1/2 c  Whole milk
Salt to taste
1 tb Lemon juice
1    To 2 tsp. finely chopped

Thoroughly was leek leaves, which tend to collect sand. Trim off and
discard root ends and all but about 1 inch of green tops. Peel off and
discard 1 to 2 layers of tough outer leaves. Cut leeks crosswise into
1/2 inch pieces.

In Dutch oven or large saucepan, melt margarine over medium heat. Add
leeks and 3 Tbsp. of stock; cook, stirring frequently, about 10
minutes, until leeks are tender but not browned. If liquid begins to
evaporate, lower heat slightly and add more stock.  Add remaining
chicken stock, potatoes, broccoli and pepper.

Lower heat, cover, and simmer about 11-14 minutes, until potatoes and
broccoli are tender.  Remove pot from heat and let cool slightly. In
batches, puree mixture in a blender on low speed 10 seconds. Then
raise speed to high and puree until completely smooth. Return puree
to pot in which it was cooked.  Add milk; stir to mix well. Simmer an
additional 4 - 5 minutes. Refrigerate about 5 hours. Before serving
stir in lemon juice and add salt, if desired.  Garnish with chopped
chives.
