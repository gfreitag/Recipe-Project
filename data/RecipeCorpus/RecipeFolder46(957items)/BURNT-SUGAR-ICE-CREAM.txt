Categories: Desserts, Ice cream, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 4 Servings
2/3 c  Sugar
1 c  Heavy cream
1 1/2 c  Milk
4    Egg yolks
pn Salt
2 ts Brandy
1/4 ts Vanilla
Melt the sugar in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring
constantly, until it turns dark brown. Meanwhile, combine the cream
and milk in a saucepan and heat until mixture bubbles around the
edge. When sugar has caramelized, remove from heat and slowly begin
stirring in the hot milk mixture.  Be careful; the mixture will
bubble violently at first. Just stop pouring and stir until the
bubbling subsides, then continue pouring until all of the milk has
been incorporated an the caramel has completely dissolved.

Place egg yolks in a bowl, add salt and beat to combine. Slowly stir
in half of the hot milk mixture. Pour back into the remaining hot
milk and cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until the
custard thickens lightly.  Remove,from heat and stir in brandy and
vanilla.

Refrigerate until completely chilled.  Freeze in an ice cream machine
according to manufacturer's directions.

Serves 4.
