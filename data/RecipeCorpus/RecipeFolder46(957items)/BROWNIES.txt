Categories: Cookies, Desserts
Yield: 16 Servings
1 ea STICK BUTTER OR MARGARINE
2 ea SQUARES UNSWEETENED CHOCOLAT
1 c  SUGAR
2 ea EGGS
1 ts VANILLA
1 ts BAKING POWDER
1/2 c  FLOUR
1 c  CHOPPED NUTS
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Melt the butter and chocolate
together in a large saucepan over very low heat. Be sure you
don't let the butter and chocolate burn!  Beat the eggs. Let the
butter and chocolate cool a bit, then add the beaten eggs and all
the other ingredients.  Stir together until well blended. Grease
an 8 inch square baking pan and pour in the brownie batter. Bake
for 20 minutes and place the baking pan on a rack to cool. While
the brownies are still warm, cut into squares but don't remove
from the pan until cool.  They will be too sticky. Sprinkle with
a little confectioner's sugar if you like.  Now don't eat too
many!!
