WALNUT SAUCE WITH FENNEL: Put the walnuts, garlic and bread crumbs in
a food processor and process briefly until everything is the texture
of fine crumbs. With the motor running, gradually pour in about 1 cup
of the water. Stop and scrape down the sides, then add enough water
until it is the consistency you want. (It will thicken somewhat as it
sits.) Stir in the oil and fennel seeds and season to taste with salt
and pepper. THE EGGPLANT: If the eggplant is mature with lots of
developed seeds when sliced, lightly salt the slices and let them sit
for 30 minutes. Blot with paper towels to draw off bitter juices. If
the eggplant is light-colored and firm, without the presence of large
seeds, just slice it and go onto the next step. Preheat the broiler.
Brush both sides of the eggplant generously with oil. Place about 3
inches from the heat source and broil until golden brown. Turn the
rounds over and broil until nicely colored and tender. If the
eggplant looks dry, brush a little more oil over the top. Set the
broiled eggplants on a platter and spoon a little of the walnut sauce
over the tops. Season with pepper and garnish with the fennel leaves
or parsley. Serve hot or slightly cooled. (NOTE: If you are not
planning to use the sauce right away, omit the garlic and add it just
before you use it. This way the sauce will keep well for at least a
week, refrigerated)
