Title: BUL-KO-KEE OR "FIRE BEEF"
Categories: Cyberealm, Meats, Kooknet
Yield: 2 Servings
1 lb Thinly sliced sirloin
1/4 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Minced garlic
1 ts Sesame oil
1/2 c  Chopped green onions
Mix soy, sugar. garlic, oil, and green onions in a mixing bowl. Add
sirloin.  Mix it all together by hand. Let marinate at least 1 hour,
covered and refrigerated. Heat wok to high. Add a little more oil.
Add meat mixture to the wok and cook at high until the meat is done.
Serve over hot rice.

**I often add vegetables such as onion, green peppers, or broccoli to
the wok after the meat has begun cooking, so they will be cooked yet
crisp.
