Scrub beets, pare and cut into quarters.  Place in a clean jar or
crock and sprinkle with the salt.  Boil the water and pour into the
jar. Cook, add the bread to aid in the fermentation, cover with the
cheesecloth and tie with the string.  Set in a cool place to ferment
for about 1 week. (Do not do this in hot humid weather; it will
decompose, not sour.) Remove any mold as it appears.  Flavor develops
in 1 to 2 weeks. Remove the bread, mold, and cheesecloth.  Taste.  It
should be sourish but mild, not brackish. Pour into clean dry jars
and cover, keeping it refrigerate until ready to use. It will keep
well in the refrigerator.
