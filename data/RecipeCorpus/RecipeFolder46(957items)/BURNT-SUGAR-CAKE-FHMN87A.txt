Categories: Amish, Cakes, Desserts
Yield: 12 Servings
3/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Boiling water
2/3 c  Butter softened
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
2    Eggs, separated
3 c  Sifted CAKE flour
1 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Milk
In a small, heavy skillet or saucepan, heat the 3/4 cups of sugar over
medium heat.  Lowerthe heat to medium low as a syrup forms, and stir
frequently, breaking up the sugar lumps with the back of a spoon.
Cook for about 30 minutes, or until a brown syrup forms and the
mixture begins to smoke.  Very gradually stir in the 3/4 cup of
boiling water and remove from heat. Cool thoroughly. Reserve 1/2 cup
of the syrup for the cake, the remaining is for the frosting.
Preheat the oven to 375F.. In a mixer bowl, cream the butter and
the 1 Cup of sugar together until light (about 3 minutes.) Gradually
beat in the 1/2 cup of the burnt sugar syrup. Add the vanilla and the
egg yolks 1 at a time, beating after each addition. Sift together the
flour, baking powder, and the salt.  Add the flour mixture
alternately with the milk and beat until smooth. Beat the egg whites
until stiff. Gently fold in whites by hand then pour the batter into
two 8 inch greased pans. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Cool and frost
with either Burnt Sugar 7 Minute or Burnt Sugar Buttercream frosting.
