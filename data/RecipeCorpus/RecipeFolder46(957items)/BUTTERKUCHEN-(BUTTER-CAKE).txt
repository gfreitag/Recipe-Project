Title: BUTTERKUCHEN (BUTTER CAKE)
Categories: Cakes, German
Yield: 12 Servings
2    Env active dry yeast
1/2 c  Water, warm
3/4 c  Milk
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Butter
4 c  All-purpose flour, sifted
Grated rind of 1 lemon
3 ea Eggs
----Butter Topping----
1/2 c  Butter (1 stick)
1 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/3 c  Almonds, blanched, slivered
Sprinkle the yeast over warm water. Heat milk, sugar, salt and the
1/2 cup butter together until sugar is dissolved and butter melted.
Cool to lukewarm. Add dissolved yeast. Place the flour blended with
lemon rind in large mixing bowl; form a well in the center. Add
yeast-milk mixture and the eggs. Stir until blended and smooth. Pour
into a buttered 9x13-inch baking pan, spreading dough evenly. Let
rise in warm place about 45 minutes.

Chop the butter into the mixed sugar and cinnamon to form fine
particles. Sprinkle over top of risen batter. Add the almonds. Bake
in oven preheated to 375 F. for 30 minutes, or until top is golden
and syrupy. Makes about 12 servings.

Variations: Streuselkuchen: This is much the same as Butterkuchen
except that the lemon rind is omitted from the butter and a crumb
topping of 1 1/2 cups flour, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup ground almonds
and 8 Tbsp (1 stick) butter are sprinkled over batter. If desired,
1/4 tsp cinnamon may also be added to the topping mixture.

Apfebutterkuchen (a Bremen specialty). Prepare as for Butterkuchen,
place sliced peeled apples over top of dough before placing in oven.
Cover apples with same Butter Topping. Almonds are an optional
addition (and very good!).
