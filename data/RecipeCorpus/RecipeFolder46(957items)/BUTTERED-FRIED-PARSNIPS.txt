Title: BUTTERED FRIED PARSNIPS
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Parsnips
4 tb Butter
1/8 ts Nutmeg
Salt & Pepper; To Taste
1 tb Parsley; Chopped
Wash, trim and scrape the parsnips.  Cut into uniform pieces and boil
in salted water, 25 to 30 minutes or until tender. Drain well, and
let dry. Just before serving, heat the butter in a skillet and saute
over moderate heat until light brown on all sides, letting the
parsnips caramelize a little in their own sugar.
Season with the nutmeg, salt and pepper and serve in a warm vegetable
dish, garnished with parsley.
