5 lb Wings,tips removed and
Separate at the joint
1/2 c  Orange juice
2    Jalapeno peppers seeded
And diced
3    Large cloves of garlic
2 c  Red wine vinegar
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
2 c  Salad oil
For the marinade combine all, but the oil in the blender..with motor
running on low add oil slowly If you don't do this slowly the oil will
separate later..put the wings in a gallon size freezer zip lock bag
and add marinade..let set overnight...........the recipe for the dry
rub I use on all meat I BBQ..This recipe fills and old Lawry seasoned
salt shaker..If thats too much cut in half... 6 Tbsp Chili powder 4
Tbsp ground cumin 1 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper mix well and pour into
shaker.........Drain wings and place on a large jelly roll pan..mine
hold 4-5 lbs. packed tight. sprinkle with the dry rub
liberally...Bake in a pre-heated 425 degree oven for 15-25
minutes..depending on how big the wings are..remove from oven and
drain..I put another cookie sheet over the first one to hold the
wings in place and pour off all the juices..there will be a lot..when
cool..just cover the whole thing and put in the refrigerater till
ready to serve...Now for the sauce....this is a doozer and worth all
the effort so don't give up on me about now!!!! 2 Cups chicken
broth..canned is fine 1/2 cup honey 1 1/4 Tbs chili powder 1 tsp
cayenne pepper 1 tbs corn starch 1 cup water.........Place broth,
honey, chili powder, and cayenne in a saucepan and bring to a
boil..Reduce by 1/3.. Mix cornstarch with water, and add to the
boiling sauce, lower temp. a little and cook till it is thick enough
to coat a spoon..10-15 min usually...........Now when you are ready
to serve all this up preheat the broiler or your grill I usually do
mine in the oven since I leave mine on the cookie sheet..Brush the
wings with the sauce and put under the broiler till hot and
crispy..they will almost char a little on the tips from the
honey...Heat the remaining sauce and serve with the wings as a
dip..my kids even dip their fries in the sauce...I promise that
