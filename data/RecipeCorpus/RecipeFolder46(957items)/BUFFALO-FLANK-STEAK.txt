Melt the butter in a heavy frying pan.  Dust the steak with flour and
brown well. Add enough boiling water to just cover the meat. Cover
and cook very slowly, until the meat is fork tender. Remove to a warm
platter, season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with parsley. Cut in
thin slanted slices against the grain of the meat to improve

and bake in a slow oven (300 F.) for 1 1/2 hours or until meat is
tender. Watch carefully that it does not become dry.
