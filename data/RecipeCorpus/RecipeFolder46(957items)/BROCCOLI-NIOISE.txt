100 g  Onions, very finely chopped

This classic French way of cooking vegetables, with onion, garlic and
fried breadcrumbs, is quite delectable piled on to triangles of puff
pastry and served piping hot.

Steam the broccoli until tender, about 5 minutes. Soften the onions
in the oil over a very gentle heat, covered, stirring from time to
time until they are soft and sweaty. This will take about 10 minutes.
Stir in the garlic and season with a little salt and pepper. Toss in
the cooked broccoli spears and place in a warm dish on the triangles
of puff pastry. Serve sprinkled with the fried breadcrumbs.
