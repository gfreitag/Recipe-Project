Title: BROCCOLI-BASED PASTA SAUCE
Categories: Digest, Sept.
Yield: 1 Servings
1    To 2 heads of broccoli
1    Onion, chopped
3    To 4 garlic cloves, chopped
1 c  Vegetable broth (or more)
1    Lemon juiced
1 ds Salt
x  Pepper to taste (1 tsp)
Steam 1-2 heads of broccoli until real soft. Meanwhile saute 1 chopped
onion and 3-4 cloves of chopped garlic
(more if you love garlic) in some white wine or broth. When
everything is done, dump into blender and add 1 cup veggie broth,
juice of 1 lemon, dash of salt, and pepper to taste (I use about    1
tsp.) and blend until smooth and thick. Add more broth if necessary
for processing. If you eat dairy you can also add parmeasan cheese.

I know this sounds too simple but it makes a heavenly pasta sauce and
keeps real well in the refrigerator for leftovers.
