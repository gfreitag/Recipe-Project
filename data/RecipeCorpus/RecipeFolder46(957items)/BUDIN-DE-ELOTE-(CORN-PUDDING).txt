Title: BUDIN DE ELOTE (CORN PUDDING)
Categories: Mexico, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
Jim Vorheis
1 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Toasted fine bread crumbs,
-approximately
For the budin:
2 c  Corn kernels*
1/2 c  Milk
5 tb Unsalted butter
3    Eggs
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Sea salt, or to taste
Heat the oven to 300 F.  Place a heavy baking sheet on the lower rack
of the oven.  Butter a 1-quart baking or souffle dish and sprinkle
with the bread crumbs. Set aside.

Put the corn and milk into a food processor and process for 10 to 15
seconds or until reduced to a textured puree. Beat the butter until
creamy and gradually add the corn and the eggs, one by one, beating
after each addition.  Add the sugar and salt.

Pour the mixture into the prepared dish and bake until the mixture is
firmly set and beginning to brown around the edges - about 35 minutes.

Either serve from the dish or carefully unmold onto a serving dish.

* Starchy field corn works best, ears of corn left intact that have
been picked a few days earlier, for the starches to heighten, can be
used.
