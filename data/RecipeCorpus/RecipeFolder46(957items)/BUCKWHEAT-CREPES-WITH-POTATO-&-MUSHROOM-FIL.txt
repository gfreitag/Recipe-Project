Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
12 lg Buckwheat Crepes
1 lb Portobello or shiitake
-mushrooms
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Butter
2    Cloves garlic; minced
Salt to taste
3 lg Yellow onions; chopped
1 ts Olive oil
2 lg Russet potatoes
1/2 c  Dry white wine
Flat-leaf parsley; coarsely
-chopped
Fresh ground black pepper
4 oz Swiss or Fontina cheese;grat
Clean the mushrooms and cut them in 1/2-inch dice. Heat a tablespoon
of olive oil and a teaspoon of butter in a large non-stick skillet
and stir the minced garlic in it for a minute. Add the mushrooms and
a little salt, and saute for 10-12 minutes, until they are tender and
starting to sizzle.

In another skillet, cook the chopped onions in the remaining olive
oil and butter, with a dash of salt, until they are soft and turning
golden.

Peel the potatoes and cut them in 1/2-inch dice. Combine them in a
saucepan with the white wine and enough water just barely to cover
them, as well as 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Bring the water to a boil,
lower the heat to a simmer, cover the pan tightly, and cook for 10-15
minutes, until the potatoes are just tender. Remove the lid and
continue cooking gently, stirring once or twice, until the liquid is
reduced and thickened to a sauce. Stir in the sauteed onions and
mushrooms, as well as chopped parsley and fresh-ground black pepper
to taste.

Allow the potato-mushroom mixture to cool slightly, then fill the
crepes. Spoon 2-3 rounded tablespoons of filling across the center of
each crepe, then sprinkle a litle grated cheese over the filling
before rolling or folding the crepe loosely over it. You should have
about a dozen filled crepes.

Cover the crepes loosely with aluminum foil and bake in a 350 degree
oven for 10-15 minutes, or until they are hot through and the cheese
is completely melted.
