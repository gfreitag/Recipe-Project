In 1954, in Miami, FL, James McLamore and David Edgerton built the
first Burger King Restaurant. By 1991 more than 6,400 Burger King
outlets could be found in fourty countries and all fifty states. That
gives this burger giant more than $6 billion in sales each year,
making it the 2nd largest fast-food chain. (McDonald's is the
largest.)
For many, the favorite item on the menu is a flame-broiled
hamburger conceived by the partners on a business trip from Orlando
to Miami in 1957. Dubbed the "Whopper," this sandwich is
overwhelmingly popular; figures show that Burger King sells more that
540 million annually, or nearly 2 million a day. And with more that
1,023 different combinations of the eight-or-so ingredients,
including a vegetarian version, you really can "have it your way."
