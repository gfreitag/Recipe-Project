Title: BUTTERMILK CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
6    Chicken breasts
1/2 c  Butter milk
1 1/2 c  Flour
1/2 ts White pepper
1 ts Salt
1    Canola oil for frying
Wash chicken breasts remove skin and visible fat,leaving the bone.
Pat dry with paper towel. Pour buttermilk in shallow bowl. In second
bowl, mix flour, pepper and salt. Put skillet on high heat and add
canola oil about 1/2" deep.
Dip each breast in the buttermilk,making sure it is completely
coated. Dip in the bowl off flour,turning to thoroughly coat both
sides.Shake each piece to remove loose flour. Place chicken in the
hot oil,flesh side down.
When skillet is full,turn heat down to medium and let chicken fry
until just golden brown and crispy,then turn and let second side get
golden.Be careful when turning not to break the buttermilk crust.
Reduce the heat to low,cover and cook 25 minutes.Check to make sure
heat is not too high and chicken does not brown to fast. Remove lid
and turn pieces over once more.Turn heat up-but not too high-- and
cook a few minutes longer until crust is crisped. If crust on the
sides of the breast is still soft and mushy,turn those pieces on
their side in the oil for a minute or two so they can fry up crisp.
Makes 6 servings.
