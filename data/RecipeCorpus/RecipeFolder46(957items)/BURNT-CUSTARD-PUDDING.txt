Title: BURNT CUSTARD PUDDING
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
3 c  Milk
1/2    Vanilla bean
- slit and scraped, -=OR=-
1 ts -Vanilla extract
4    Eggs; whole
2    Egg yolks
2 tb Flour
3/4 c  White sugar
1/4 c  Brown sugar
COMBINE MILK AND VANILLA in a pot, place over high heat, bring to a
boil and immediately remove from heat. Remove vanilla bean, dry well
and store in an airtight plastic bag. You can use a vanilla bean
about 3 times. Meanwhile, combine eggs, yolks, flour and 1/2 cup of
white sugar in a mixing bowl and mix well. Slowly pour scalded milk
over the egg mixture, mixing all the time. Pour this mixture back
into the pot and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring with a wooden
spoon, until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Scrape the
cooked mixture into a bowl and let cool. When cool, cover and place
in the refrigerator to chill. Not more than 30 minutes before
serving, mix remaining white sugar together with brown sugar. Divide
the custard between 4 soup bowls and sprinkle the surface with all
the sugar. Wipe the bottom of a 6-inch heavy skillet to remove any
loose debris and place over high heat. When the skillet is very hot,
use it to burn the surface of the custard. Carefully press the
surface of each custard with the bottom of the hot skillet. The sugar
will quickly burn and there will be a lot of smoke. Quickly wipe the
bottom of the skillet after each custard is burnt and replace on the
heat for a minute to get it hot. Don't refrigerate custards after
burning and serve within 30 minutes.
