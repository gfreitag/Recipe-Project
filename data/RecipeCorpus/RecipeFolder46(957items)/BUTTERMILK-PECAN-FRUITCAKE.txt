1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
3 c  Pears, dried, chopped
2 c  Pecans, chopped
1 c  Butter
3 c  Sugar

Preheat oven to 400; grease and flour 4 loaf pans. Separate eggs. Mix
flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add pears and pecans;
stir again.  Set aside. In large bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add
egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add

buttermilk, blending well after each addition.

With clean dry beaters, beat egg whites until they stand in firm,

then fold in remaining whites.  Fill each pan 2/3 of batter.

center of each cake comes out clean. Ten minutes before cakes are
done, rotate pans back to front to cakes on each rack brown evenly.
Let cakes cool five minutes on wire racks, then turn out and finish
cooling right side up on wire racks.

Before serving, decorate top of fruitcakes with whole nuts and mixed
candied fruit peel.
