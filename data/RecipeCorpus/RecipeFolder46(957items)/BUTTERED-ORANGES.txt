-decoration, optional
To prepare the Orange Shells: Hold the orange so the stalk (or navel)
is at the base and using a small knife cut off the top about two
inches down. Scoop out all the flesh, being carefully not to break
the skin. This can be done quite easily with a teaspoon. Using a pair
of scissors, cut off the stalk that remains in the bottom, wash the
orange and set it aside (the top can be discarded). Repeat this
procedure with three more of the oranges. Grate the peel off the
remaining orange and then squeeze the juice from this orange into the
bowl. Place the flesh you have extracted from the other oranges in
the sieve and squeeze the juice in the same bowl. Mix the juice with
the sugar and egg yolks in a double boiler over low heat. Beat with a
wire whisk until the mixture begins to thicken. Remove the top of the
double boiler and cool in a bowl of cold water while you continue to
stir; then add the sherry and rosewater. Remove the bowl from the
cold water. Cut the butter into 1-inch cubes and mash it into the
mixture piece by piece. Add the orange peel. Whip 3/4 of the cream
and fold it into the mixture. Pour the mixture into the four orange
shells and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Before serving, place
three crystallized violets on the top of each orange; whip the
remaining cream and force it through a pastry tube in a curly pattern
around the top edges. SERVES:4
