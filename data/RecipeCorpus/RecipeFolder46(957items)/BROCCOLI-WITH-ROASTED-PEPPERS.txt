Categories: Digest, Dec.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lg Bunch broccoli
1    Garlic clove, thinly sliced
3 tb Roasted peppers, diced
2 ts Finely chopped marjoram or
1/2 ts Dried
1 tb Finely chopped parsley

Cut the broccoli into fairly large flowerets; peel the stems and cut
into spears or rounds.  Steam it, and while it steams prepare the
rest of the ingredients.

When the broccoli is cooked, warm some water in a large pan and add
the sliced garlic.  Then add the steamed broccoli, peppers, marjoram,
and parsley. Saute over lively heat until everything is warmed. Serve
warm. (She also suggestsd serving it with a lemon wedge as a warm
salad.)
