Title: BUFFALO CHICKEN WINGS #2
Categories: Appetizers, Chicken
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Chicken Wings
Oil For Frying
1/2 c  Butter
1 tb Tabasco Sauce
1 tb Hot Pepper Sauce
Blue Cheese Dressing
Chilled Celery Sticks
Fry up the chicken wings that have had the tips removed and cut in
half at the joint in 1/4 cup of butter until golden brown. Allow the
wings to cool before frying a second time, yes they are fried a
second time so if you are a calorie watcher you can stop now. They
can be fried the first time a day ahead. Before frying the second
time mix the Tabasco and Hot Pepper sauce with the melted butter. Fry
the wings a second time in the HOT butter until wings are heated. You
need to use enough Tabasco and Hot Pepper sauce to give the butter a
reddish color. Serve with chilled celery sticks and blue cheese
dressing.
