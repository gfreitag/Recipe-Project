Title: BROILED SCALLOPS & BACON HORS D'OEUVRES
Categories: Pork, Seafood
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Sea scallops
1/3    Bacon
Recipe by: Felicia Pickering <MNHAN063@SIVM.SI.EDU> Remove any tough
cartilage from the sides of the scallops, wipe off any bits of shell,
and pat them dry. In a large frying pan, partially cook bacon until
it has released its fat but is still limp and flexible; remove it to
brown paper or paper towels and drain it well. Cut the bacon pieces
in halves or thirds so that they are just long enough to wrap around
a scallop with a slight overlap.  Wrap each scallop with a piece of
bacon and secure the wrap with a toothpick. Place the wrapped
scallops on a rack that is set in a baking pan and cook under a
preheated broiler, turning once, just until the bacon is crisp and
the scallops are opaque. Serve immediately.

Variations: Roll the scallops in pancetta or prosciutto instead of
bacon. Add something crunchy - a length of scallion or a thin slice
of kohlrabi - next to the scallop before rolling it in the bacon.
Substitute drained water chestnuts for one-third of the scallops
