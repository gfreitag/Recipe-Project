Title: BUTTERHORNS
Categories: Breakfast, Desserts, Breads
Yield: 36 Servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
3    Eggs, beaten
1/4 c  Water
4 1/2 c  Flour
3/4 c  Scalded milk
3/4 c  Butter, melted
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Shortening
1/2 ts Salt
Soften yeast in warm water with 1 tbs of sugar. Set aside. In another
large bowl combine milk, shortening, sugar, and salt. Cool to
lukewarm then add yeast mixture and mix well. Add eggs. Measure in
flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well until dough is smooth, soft and
elastic, and no longer sticky. Knead lightly on floured surface. Form
into ball. Place in warm bowl, cover and let rise in a warm, draft
free place until doubled; about 2 to 2-1/2 hours with regular yeast.
Punch down, knead lightly and divide into thirds. Roll each third
into a 12 inch circle.  Brush with melted butter. Cut into 12
pie-shaped wedges and roll (starting at wide end ending at the point)
each wedge into a crescent. Brush each crescent with melted butter.
Place on greased baking sheet and let rise until very light (about an
hour). Bake at about 375 degrees for about 12 minutes or until light
golden brown. Experiment with your oven, as the temperature can vary
between 350 and 400 degrees.  If the rolls burn on the bottom before
turning light brown, the oven is too hot.
