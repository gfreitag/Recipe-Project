Title: BUTTERCUP SQUASH~ BARNARD INN STYLE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 ea Medium buttercup squash
1/4 c  Butter
1 x  Salt
1 x  Nutmeg
1/4 c  Vermont maple syrup
2 ea Large Cortland apples
12 ea Cranberries
1 x  Sugar syrup (one part sugar
1 x  To one part water)
Blanch cranberries in sugar syrup, being careful not to boil. (They
shouldn't burst.)  Cool and leave in syrup for one hour or refrigerate
overnight. Slice the apples into 1/4 inch (approximately) slices and
spread on buttered tray. Cut one medium buttercup squash (unpeeled)
into eight pieces and steam until the inside is soft, while the shell
remains somewhat firm. Scoop out slightly cooled meat and mash. Whip
the mashed squash with about one-fourth cup of butter, nutmeg, and
salt to taste, and about one-fourth cup of maple syrup (depending on
dryness of the squash) to achieve a consistency that will hold its
shape. Squeeze through a piping bag (or substitute) and mound onto
the apple slices. Cortland preferred because it doesn't discolor
quickly.)  Place a blanched cranberry on top. Just before serving,
heat on buttered tray in preheated 350Ã¸ oven for 10-15 minutes.
These may be prepared ahead and refrigerated until ready to heat and
serve. by Chef/Owner Sepp Schenker From In Season, a publication of
