1. Cook the rice according to package directions.

2. About 15 min before the rice is ready, melt the butter in a large
heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and saute, stirring
often, until the onion is very soft and just begins to color, about
10    min.

3. Stir in the garlic and the walnuts. Saute over medium heat,
stirring, until the walnuts and onions are golden and the garlic is
tender.

the onions and walnuts on top and lightly fluff with a fork. Garnish
with the scallions.

This goes great with broiled fish fillets.
