Soak lima beans overnight in cold water then drain. Combine first 6
ingredients in small piece of cheesecloth and secure with a string.
Add to an 8-quart pot with the stock and bring to a simmer over
medium-high heat. Add hen, giblets, and 1 chopped onion. Simmer,
covered, until the chicken is tender, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Chill
overnight if desired. Skim fat from surface of stock.  Remove
chicken; discard skin and bones and cut meat into bite-size pieces.
Set aside. Cook bacon until crisp in medium skillet over medium heat.
Remove with slotted spoon to paper towel and drain well. Add to
stock.  Pour off all but 2 tblsp fat and place skillet over high
heat. Add remaining onion and saute quickly until browned. Add to
stock along with potatoes, tomatoes, lima beans, tomato paste, red
pepper, salt, and pepper, and stir to combine. Cover partially and
simmer until beans are tender, about 40-60 minutes.  (Stew can be
prepared several days ahead to this point and refrigerated.) Stir in
reserved chicken, okra, and corn. Bring stew to simmer, then drop
dumpling batter in by tablespoonfuls. Cover pot securely and simmer
until dumplings are puffed and a toothpick inserted in center comes
out clean, about 15 minutes. Turn into soup tureen to serve or spoon
dumplings into heated bowls and ladle soup over. Corn Dumplings:
~-------------- Combine flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and
sugar in medium bowl and mix well. Cut in butter using a pastry
blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in
corn using fork, then add milk and stir just until moistened; _do not
overmix_. Add to stew and cook as directed.
