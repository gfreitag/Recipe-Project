Yield: 4 Servings
2 tb Peanut oil
4    Chicken thighs

2 lg Onions; cut in 1/2" wedges
4    Cloves garlic; thin sliced

"Luscious and spicy, serve this simple Burmese curry with steamed
rice and stir-fried vegetables to make a complete meal."

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

In a large, nonstick skillet, heat the peanut oil over moderate heat.
Add the chicken in batches and brown on all sides. Remove with a
slotted spoon and place in a baking dish large enough to accommodate
the chicken and the coconut milk in one layer.

Using the same skillet and the oil and chicken fat remaining in it,
cook the onions, garlic, jalapeno peppers, caraway, and cinnamon over
high heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat
and add to the chicken. Pour the coconut milk into the hot skillet
and stir, scraping the bottom to remove any browned particles. Add to
the onions and chicken and mix well.

Bake, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven, add the
basil, and mix gently. Season with salt and pepper, and serve
immediately.
