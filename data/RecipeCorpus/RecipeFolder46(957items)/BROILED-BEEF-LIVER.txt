Title: BROILED BEEF LIVER
Categories: Meats
Yield: 80 Servings
1 lb Sliced beef liver
French dressing
I love liver. One of my favorite ways to prepare it is broiling. I
place the liver on the broiler pan, cover it with bottled french
dressing and broil about three minutes. Turn it over, cover with more
dressing, and broil another three minutes.

I found the most common problem with cooking liver is over cooking
it, why in the world does it have to be cooked like shoe leather?
