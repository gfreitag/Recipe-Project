Grease a jelly roll baking sheet.  Line with parchment paper. Grease
the parchment paper.  Sift dry ingredients together. Beat eggs at
high speed about 5 to 10 minutes. Add sugar by tablespoonfuls.
Continue beating until the butter is very thick. Then add lemon juice
and water. Fold in dry ingredients in four stages, 1/4 cup at a time.
Spread evenly on the baking sheet.  Bake at 375 F. for 15 minutes or
until the sponge springs back when tested.  Sift powdered sugar onto
the sponge. Turn cake out onto a clean tea towel. Remove parchment
paper. Trim edges of the sponge if they are crispy.  Roll up gently,
leaving towel inside, while still warm. Let cool.

Beat egg whites, and when foamy add the cream of tartar. When soft
peaks form, gradually beat in the sugar. Beat until meringue is stiff
and glossy. Pipe meringue through a pastry bag, making and equal
number of stems and caps to resemble small mushrooms.  Bake mushroom
pieces at 250 F. about 45 minutes.  When cool, glue them together
with butter cream icing and dust lightly with cocoa in a fine
strainer. Beat egg yolks and butter together until smooth.  Add
coffee and milk. Gradually add powdered sugar. Beat until smooth. Mix
about 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup of the frosting with green food coloring for
the ivy decoration.

To assemble:  Unroll cooled sponge, remove towel, spread, cake with
butter cream icing. Roll up.  Cut off at a diagonal, a 2" slice. This
is the tree stump. Frost the outside, then add the stump and frost.
Make ivy patterns. Add the mushrooms.  Dust the whole cake very
lightly with powdered sugar, to simulate snow. Keep in refrigerator.
Cut with serrated knife.
