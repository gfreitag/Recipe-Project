Side ribs are cheaper than back ribs - there is lots of bone, but you
can still get nice portions of meat. Five-spice powder, available in
Chinese grocery stores and supermarkets, is a mixture of cinnamon,
fennel, cloves, star anise, and black pepper.

Cut ribs into small sections; trim fat. in large saucepan, cover ribs
with cold water. Add onion and bay leaf. Bring to boil; simmer for
35-40 minutes or until fork-tender. Drain, discarding onion and bay
leaf.

Sauce: Meanwhile, in small saucepan, combine juice, honey, soy sauce,
ginger, five-spice powder and garlic. Bring to boil; reduce heat and
simmer for 10 minutes.

Arrange ribs in single layer in 13x9-inch baking dish. Spoon sauce
over top. Bake in 350F 180C oven, turning twice and basting
occasionally, for 30-35 minutes or until ribs are glazed and sauce is
thickened and sticky. 6 servings for $7.76 CDN [Mar/95]
