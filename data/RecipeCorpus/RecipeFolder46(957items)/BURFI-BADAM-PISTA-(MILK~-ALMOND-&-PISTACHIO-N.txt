Title: BURFI BADAM PISTA (MILK~ ALMOND & PISTACHIO N
Categories: Candies, Indian
Yield: 1 Servings
9 oz Khoa; (see directions)
3 oz Castor sugar
1 oz Almonds
2 dr Kewra essence or 1 drop
- itar kewra
1/2 oz Pistachio nuts
4 md Silver leaves (optional)
Prepare khoa (dried fresh whole milk) by boiling 2 pints Jersey milk
or 960 mls buffalo milk briskly in a heavy pan (karahi). Stir all the
time until it dries up (takes about half an hour) and see that the
fire burns well, as slow heating turns the khoa creamy in colour. The
finished product should be white if properly prepared. Keep aside and
allow it to cool.

Add castor sugar (or substitute powdered sugar) to khoa and mix
thoroughly. Then cook for 10 minutes, taking care not to let the
mixture stick to the bottom. Mix minced almonds and pistachios; stir
for 2 to 3 seconds, remove from the heat and allow it to cool; add
kewra essence or the itar.

Invert a thali or a tray and grease its back; put the mixture over it
and roll out as neat and aas straight as possible. Decorate with
silver leaves. When it cools down and becomes firm, cut into diamond
pieces. Keep in an air-tight tin.
