Title: BUTTERMILK PANCAKES
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 16 Cakes
1/2 c  Buttermilk; to 3/4 cup
2 tb Butter; melted
1    Egg
1 c  Flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
2 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
Beat the buttermilk, butter and egg lightly in a mixing bowl. Mix the
flour, baking soda, sugar and salt and add them all at once to the
first mixture, stirring just enough to moisten the flour. Lightly
butter or grease a griddle or frying pan and set over moderate heat
until a few drops of cold water sprinkled on the pan form skittering
globules. Pour about 1/4 cup per pancake on the griddle; bake until
the cakes are very bubbly on top and the undersides are lightly
browned. Turn with a spatula and brown the other side.  Place
finished cakes on a heated plate in a very slow (200 F) oven until
ready to serve.
