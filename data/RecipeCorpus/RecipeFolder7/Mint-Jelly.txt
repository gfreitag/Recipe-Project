Title: Mint Jelly
Categories: Toppings, Preserve
Yield: 6 servings
3 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Mint leaves
1/2 c  Commercial pectin (boxed)
1/2 c  Vinegar
Green coloring
1 c  Water
Combine vinegar, water, mint leaves, and enough coloring to give tint
desired. Add sugar, stir, and bring to a boil.  Add pectin at once,
stirring constantly, and bring again to a full boil for 1/2 minute.  Strain
off mint leaves and pour into glasses.

**When cold, cover with paraffin.  Approximate yield: 6 (6 oz.) glasses. My
note:  The newer directions call for the jelly to be sealed while scalding
hot.  I've also put lids on and put it in the freezer.  If you have trouble
with thickening use more pectin.
