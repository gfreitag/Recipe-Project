raisins, or raisins and nuts. NONBREAD SANDWICHES: * LETTUCE ROLLUPS: Use
romaine, iceberg, or escarole.  You can even use spinach leaves if you have
the patience.  Spread them with cream cheese, ricotta, or any other
filling.  Or roll the lettuce around pieces of cheese and chicken or
turkey, perhaps with a pineapple chunk if the kids like to mix tastes. *
TURKEY ROLLUPS:  Use turkey instead of lettuce and fill with the spread or
filling of your choice. * VARIATIONS:  Use other wrappings for your
rollups.  These could include cheese slices or low-fat sliced luncheon
meat.
