Cut a lengthwise slit down one side of each poblano chile.  Carefully
remove the seeds and membranes and set aside.  Cook and stir ground beef
and onion in a 10-inch skillet until beef is brown and drain.  Stir in
remaining ingredients except the eggs, flour, oil, Walnut Sauce,
Pomegranate seeds and cilantro.  Cover and simmer for 15 minutes.  Fill
chiles with beef mixture.  Cover and refrigerate for an hour.  Beat egg
whites in a large bowl until stiff.  Beat egg yolks and fold them into the
egg whites.  Coat filled chiles with flour; dip into the egg mixture. Heat
1/4-inch of oil in an 8-inch skillet until hot.  Cook chiles, one at a
time, in the oil, turning once, until puffy and golden, about 2 minutes on
each side; drain.  Place on cookie sheet and keep warm in a 200 degree F
oven.  Prepare Walnut Sauce and spoon over the chiles.  Sprinkle with
pomgranate seeds and cilantro.  Serve hot. WALNUT SAUCE: Mix all
ingredients.
