Dry Mustard Powder
Water
Mustard loses potency if heated therefore the traditional recipe calls for
COLD water. Mix mustard powder and cold water in proportions to make a
smooth paste but only enough for current use. Let stand for at least 10
minutes before serving to allow the enzymes to develop. Serve: with beef,
ham, cheese and sausages.
