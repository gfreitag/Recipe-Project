Title: Rice and Sour Cream Casserole
Categories: Casseroles, Mexican, Rice/grains, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Cooked Rice
1    Salt & Pepper To Taste
1/2 c  Grated Cheddar, Garnish
3/4 lb Monterey Jack Cheese
3 c  Dairy Sour Cream
2 cn Diced Green Chiles
Cut Jack Cheese into strips about 1/8" thick. Thoroughly mix sour cream and
chiles. Butter a 1-1/2 quart casserole. Season rice with salt and pepper.
Layer rice, sour cream mixture and cheese strips, in that order, until you
finish with rice on the top. Bake in 350Ã¸F oven for about 30 minutes.
During the last few minutes of baking sprinkle the grated cheddar cheese
over the rice and allow it to melt before removing casserole from oven. I
have been told this dish should be illegal, it is so good.  From: Syd's
