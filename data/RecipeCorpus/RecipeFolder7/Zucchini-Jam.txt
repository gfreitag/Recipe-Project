Title: Zucchini Jam
Categories: Toppings, Preserve
Yield: 6 servings
5 c  Sugar
13 oz Crushed pineapple
6 oz Apricot Jello
6 c  Zucchini-peeled and grated
1/4 c  Water
1 pk Sure-Jell
Boil the zucchini and water until soft.  Add Sure-Jell and bring to a hard
boil.  Add sugar and pineapple.  Boil 5 minutes.  Remove form heat. Add
apricot Jello.  Stir well.  Pack in sterilized jars and seal.

I use the Sure-Jell Light and use only 3 1/2 cups sugar.  This is an orange
colored jam and really tastes great...unless you don't like apricots or
pineapple!
