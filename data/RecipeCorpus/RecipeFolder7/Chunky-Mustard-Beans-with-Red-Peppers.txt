Title: Chunky Mustard Beans with Red Peppers
Categories: Pickles, Beans
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/3 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
1 c  Cold water
2 c  White or cider vinegar
1 tb Celery seeds
1 1/2 ts Mustard seeds
2 lb Green and/or yellow beans
2 c  Julienne strips of red
-peppers (sweet)
1 1/2 c  Onions, coarsely chopped
1 ts Tumeric
1/3 c  Dry mustard
1/3 c  All purpose flour
Remove stem end from beans; cut beans into 1 inch lengths.  There should be
about 8 cups. In a large pot of rapidly boiling water, cook beans, about
1/3 at a time, until tender-crunchy, about 3 minutes. As each batch cooks,
transfer immediately to large bowl of cold water to chill. Blanch peppers
and onions in similar way, boiling peppers for 1 minute and onions for 2
minutes.  Drain thoroughly. In a medium bowl, blend tumeric, mustard, flour
and salt into sugar. Stir in cold water to make a smooth paste. In a large
heavy preserving kettle, combine vinegar and celery and mustard seeds;
bring to boil. Stir in about 1 cup of spiced vinegar into mustard paste,
then whisk mustard past into spiced vinegar in saucepan. Cook over medium
heat, whisking constantly until sauce is smooth. Reduce heat and simmer
uncovered, for 5 minutes.  Pour drained vegetables into sauce; mix well and
return to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 4 - 5 minutes or until vegetables
are tender.  Ladle into hot sterilized jars leaving 1/8 inch head space.
Seal.  I prefer to process these in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes for
1/2 pint jars and 15 minutes for pint jars. Makes about 9 cups.
