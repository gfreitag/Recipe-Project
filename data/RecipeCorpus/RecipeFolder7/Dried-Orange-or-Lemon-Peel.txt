a cheese or vegetable grater

Use the coarse side of a cheese grater to grate off the citrus skin in
strips; use only the orange (or yellow) part of the skin avoiding the
bitter white part.  Spread the peel strips on two ceramic plates and let
dry, uncovered, at room temperature, for 3 to 4 days.  When the peels
become brittle and shriveled, store them in a small glass jar.

To use:  Whirl the whole dried peels in a blender or food processor until
powdered, or use a mortar or pestle.  The strong citrus oil will stay
within the dry peels and will be released fully upon powdering. Use whole
dried orange peel in tea blends and to perk up hot chocolate. Use powdered
orange or lemon peel in place of extract in baking; also in toppings, to
flavor sugar-bowl sugar and to flavor honey, duck, and barbecue sauces.
