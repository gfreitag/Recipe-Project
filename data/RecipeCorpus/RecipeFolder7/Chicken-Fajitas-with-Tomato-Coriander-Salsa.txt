about 4 minutes per side.  Set aside, covered, and keep warm. Heat oven to
375F.  Wrap tortillas in foil and warm in oven for 10 minutes. Pit, peel
and cut the avocados into 1/2-inch cubes.  Cut the chicken into thin
slices.  Divide chicken among the tortillas.  Top chicken in each tortilla
with 2 tablespoons Salsa, 2 tablespoons sour cream and chopped avocado. Use
