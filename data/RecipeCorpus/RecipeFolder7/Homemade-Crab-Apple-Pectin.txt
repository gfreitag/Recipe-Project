Title: Homemade Crab Apple Pectin
Categories: Toppings, Preserve
Yield: 1 servings
3 c  Water
2 lb Sliced unpeeled crab apples
Simmer, stirring for 30 to 40 minutes, adding water as needed.  Plop into
colander lined with one layer of cheesecloth and set over a bowl; press to
force the juices.  To clear, heat the collected juice and pour through a
stout jelly bag that has been moistened in hot water.  The result is the
pectin you will use right away, can (1/2" headroom, process 185 F for 15
min), or freeze.  Refrigerate after opening.

Liquid pectin is especially helpful in making peach, pear, strawberry or
other jellies whose fruit is low in pectin.

4-6 tb of homemade pectin for every 1 cup of prepared juice should give a
good gel.  For tart apple pectin, start with 4 pounds sliced apples with
peels & cores and 8 cups of water.  Simmer 3 min, press through sieve.
Return liquid to heavy kettle and cook briskly, stirring, until volume is
reduced by one-half.  Clarify and use as above.
