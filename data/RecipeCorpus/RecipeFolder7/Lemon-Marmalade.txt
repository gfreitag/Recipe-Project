Title: Lemon Marmalade
Categories: Condiment, Preserve
Yield: 6 servings
8 c  Sugar - granulated (actually
-8 to 10 cups)
3 lb Lemons - Meyer or regular
-lemons
Slice the lemons as thin as possible.  Discard ends.  Remove all seeds and
tie them in a square of doubled cheesecloth.  Put lemons and seed bag in a
nonreactive bowl with enough water to cover.  Let stand overnight.

Measure the lemons and water into a wide, shallow, nonreactive pan. Add an
equal volume of sugar and cook over low heat until sugar is dissolved.
Raise heat to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently and skimming off
the foam as it rises, until temperature reaches 220F, about 1/2 hour.
Remove marmalade from heat.

To test for consistency, drop a little marmalade on a saucer and put the
saucer into the freezer until marmalade is cold, about 5 minutes. Tip the
saucer:  the marmalade should just barely run.  If too thin, return the
marmalade to medium-high heat and cook, testing often, until it has reached
the right consistency.

Put marmalade into hot, sterilized pint or half-pint jars.  Store in
refrigerator up to 1 month or, for longer storage, seal according to
reliable canning instructions.
