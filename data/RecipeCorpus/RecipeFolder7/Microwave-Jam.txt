Title: Microwave Jam
Categories: Condiment

1/4 ts Ground cinnamon.
To make Microwave Jam:

Only a small amount of fruit necessary and NO pectin.  And the jam cooks up
so fast you can even serve it warm 20 minutes after you start.  Color and
flavor are lovely, too.  Store in  the refrigerator for up to three
months---OR IT CAN BE FROZEN. (which is what we do!)

Prepare specific fruit as directed below.  Place in a 3-quart casserole.
Add specific amount of sugar, butter, lemon juice and flavoring.  Cook,
UNCOVERED, on high about 15 minutes, boiling.  Boil ONLY 2 minutes.  Test
again.
