Title: Apricot-Jalapeno Jelly
Categories: Toppings, Spices/etc., Hot, Preserve
Yield: 6 servings
1    And 1/2 cups dried apricots,
-chopped
6 c  Sugar
3 oz Liquid pectin
4    Drops red food color
1/2 c  Jalapeno peppers, stems &
-seeds removed
1 lg Red bell pepper, stem &
-seeds removed
2 c  Cider vinegar
Put jalapenos, bell pepper, & vinegar in blender.  Puree 'til coarsely
ground and small chunks remain.

Combine apricots, sugar, & jalapeno/pepper/vinegar mixture in large
saucepan. Bring to a boil. Boil rapidly, 5 minutes. Remove from heat; skim
off any foam that forms.

Allow mixture to cool for 2 minutes.  Then mix in pectin (and food coloring
if you're going to use it).

Pour into sterilized jars, seal, and cool.  (I processed in a boiling water
bath for 10 minutes.)

Yield:  3 pints (I got 7 half pint containers.)

Gerlach also wrote:  "This recipe calls for apricots but peaches,
nectarines, and pears work equally well.  Any fresh green chile can also be
substituted, depending on your heat preference.  Serranos will make it
hotter; roasted, peeled New Mexican chiles will tame it down."
