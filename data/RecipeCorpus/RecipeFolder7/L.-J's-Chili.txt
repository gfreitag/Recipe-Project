Cut beef into 1 inch chunks or thereabouts. Let beef soak in a bowl with
the tomatoes and juice, lemon juice, mushrooms, black pepper, crushed
chilis and onions over night. Brown the meat in a skillet. In large pot
throw in the tomatoes and crushed chillis, onions, meat, paste, everything
except the beans and peppers and slow cook for three hours. Next chop your
green and red peppers into long slivers or if you prefer diced. Also stir
in your beans and cook slowly for one more hour. All cooking must not have
the lid on. With the thick "soupy" ring around the pot; stir back into the
simmering chili.

You might like the chili hotter or maybe milder, depends on your taste.
What ever you do, don't ruin the chili by making it hotter with hot sauces,
this has a tendency to make the chili into "superficial" body heat not a
deep solid heat. To accompany the chili try and get your hands on some
"Agua Dente" (fire water) 80% alcohol (national drink in Colombia). I
guarantee you will see God!
