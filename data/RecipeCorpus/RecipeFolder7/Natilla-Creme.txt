Title: Natilla Creme
Categories: Mexican, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
3/4 c  Sugar
1/8 ts Salt
1    Nutmeg
4    Eggs, separated
1/4 c  Flour
1 qt Milk
Servings:  6

Make a paste of egg yolks, flour and 1 cup of the milk. In a medium
saucepan, add the sugar and salt to the remaining milk and scald at medium
temperature. Add the egg yolk mixture to the scalded milk and continue to
cook at medium temperature until it reaches the consistency of soft
custard. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Beat egg whites
until stiff but not dry and fold into the custard. Chill before serving.
Spoon custard into individual serving dishes. Sprinkle each with nutmeg
before serving.  Or spoon custard over chilled guava slices. Served over
guava is my personal favorite.
