When Grandmama made these little pies she included anise, which grew wild
around our rancho.

Sift together first 4 ingredients. Cut in the shortening and butter using a
pastry blender or 2 knives. The mixture should resemble coarse meal.

Combine brandy and milk, and drizzle over flour mixture, stirring with a
fork to distribute. Do not over-blend.

Form into a flat disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

To make the filling, blend together the pumpkin, brown sugar, spices, egg
and vanilla.

When dough is chilled, roll out thinly on a floured board or pastry cloth.
Cut into 4- or 5-inch circles. Place about 2 table- spoons pumpkin filling
on the lower half of each dough circle. Fold over top half. Press the edges
together with a fork. Brush tops with egg wash and place on a baking sheet.
Bake 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden.

While still warm, sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar. These may be baked 1
day ahead. Before serving, warm in a 350 degrees for 8 minutes.

Makes 14 to 16 empanadas.
