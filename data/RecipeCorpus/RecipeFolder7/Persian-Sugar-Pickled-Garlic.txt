Separate garlic cloves, but do not peel.  Place all ingredients in a large
heavy-bottom saucepan.  Bring to a boil; cook for 10 minutes, stirring from
time to time.  Reduce heat to moderate and cook 5 minutes.  Cool to room
temperature.  Transfer to a large glass or ceramic jar large enough to hold
garlic and the liquid.  Tightly seal.  Refrigerate at least 1 month before
serving.  The garlic improves with age for as long as 15 years.
