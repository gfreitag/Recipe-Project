Plain Boiled Rice
Jim Vorheis
1 c  Unconverted long-grain rice
2 c  Cold water
Put the rice into a bowl, cover with very hot water, and leave to soak
about 8 minutes.  Drain, rinse well, and set aside.  Put 2 cups water in a
heavy pot or earthenware bean pot, bring to a boil, sprinkle in the rice,
and return to the boil.  Cover the pan, turn the heat to the lowest
possible point, and cook until all the water has been absorbed by the rice,
shaking the pot from time to time so that it does not stick. Test the rice
after about 15 minutes; if soft but not mushy, turn off the heat and leave
the rice sitting, still covered, for a further 5 minutes. Very carefully
loosen the rice with a fork, fluffing it up. Cover again and leave to sit
for another 15 minutes.  Add salt if desired.
