Title: Peppy Dill Wedges
Categories: Pickles
Yield: 16 servings
1 c  Cider vinegar
1 c  Water
1 tb Dill seed
1/2 ts Crushed red pepper
4 c  Cucumber wedges quartered 1"
2    Cloves garlic, optional
2 tb Pickling salt
2 c  Ice cubes
Cut large cucumber lengthwise in quarters, then in 1" long pieces.

Combine cucumber, garlic, if desired, and salt in a glass bowl.  Cover with
ice cubes.  Let stand in a cool place at least 6 hours or overnight. Drain
well.

Combine vinegar, water, dill seed and crushed red pepper in a saucepan.
Bring to a boil.  Add drained cucumbers, return to boil.  Cover and cook 2
min.  Remove garlic cloves.  Spoon into hot sterilized jars.  Wipe jar
rims.  Seal.

MY NOTE:  this recipe did not call for processing in a hot water bath so I
made 1/2 batch and kept them in the fridge.  Similar recipe in Bernardin
Guide to Home Preserving calls for processing 10 minutes at altitudes up to
1000 ft.
