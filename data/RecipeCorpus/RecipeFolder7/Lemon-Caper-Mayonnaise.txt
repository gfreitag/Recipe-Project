Title: Lemon Caper Mayonnaise
Categories: Condiment, Sauces
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 ts Capers; chopped, drained
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
1 tb Lemon peel; minced
Mix all ingredients together in small bowl.  (Can be prepared 5 days
ahead.  Chill.)
Note from me:  I would suggest adding a drop of Tabasco to this
mixture.  Some white pepper wouldn't hurt if it still needs flavor. Bon
Appetit, March, 1991.
