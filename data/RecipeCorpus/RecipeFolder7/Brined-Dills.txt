Title: Brined Dills
Categories: Pickles
Yield: 6 servings
1 pt White vinegar
2 ga Water
1 lb Salt
48 sm Cucumbers
1    Box whole pickling spices
3 bn Dry dill
Wash and drain cukes. Put down a layer of dill in a large crock. Layer
cukes, dill, pickling spices  (and whole rocambole and washed grape leaves
if desired)  in crock. Stir together remaining ingredients and pour over
cucumbers until well covered. (make more brine as necessary) Place a heavy
plate on top of cukes, and weight it down with a large jar filled with
water.  Do not fill crock to the top as it may overflow when the cukes
release water. Let sit for approx 3 weeks, or until cukes are uniformly
colored throughout and well flavored with dill. Remove cukes from brine and
wash, discarding any soft cukes. Pack pickles into clean quart jars adding
1-2 cloves sliced rocambole  (or garlic), 1 t peppercorns, 1/4 t pickling
spices, and 1/2 t turmeric. Make up fresh brine from recipe above, bring to
a boil and pour over dills in jar leaving 1" of headroom. Seal jars and
process in boiling water bath 5 minutes.  Start counting time the second
the jars are placed in the boiling water. Wait at least three weeks before
eating.
