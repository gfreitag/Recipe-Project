Title: Salsa Mexicana (Cruda)
Categories: Mexican, Salsa
Yield: 6 servings
3    Chiles seranos, finely
-chopped, with seeds
1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
1/3 c  Cold water
1 md Tomato (6 ounces)
4 tb Finely chopped white onion
2 tb Roughly chopped fresh
-coriander
Chop the unskinned tomato and mix with the rest of the ingredients.

Although this can be made up to three hours ahead, it is best made at
almost the last minute, for it soon loses its crispness and the coriander
it's sharp flavor.
