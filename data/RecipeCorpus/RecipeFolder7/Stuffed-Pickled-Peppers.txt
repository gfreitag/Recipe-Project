A lot of trouble, but a conversation piece when finished. Old time cooks
called these and stuffed whole fruits "mangoes."  They were favorites in
English-American homes because the flavor is superb with baked ham, game,
roast pork, and with baked beans.  Serve whole as a salad, or slice and use
as garnish.

Wash all vegetables thoroughly before chopping; drain peppers; cut off tops
and save; remove seeds and membranes.  Cover tops and peppers with water
and bring to boiling; boil gently 10 minutes, or until almost tender.
Drain, and let cool.  Combine chopped vegetables.  Mix remaining
ingredients; pour over vegetables and mix well.  Stuff into peppers, do not
pack too tightly.  Place top on each pepper.  Tie in place with string.
Place peppers in wide mouthed jars or in a large crock or jar. Heat
together in agate or enamel kettle all of the following ingredients except
olive oil.

3 pints cider vinegar 1 quart water 1/2 cup salt 1 Tbsp. celery seeds 1 1/2
Tbsp. mustard seeds 4 Tbsp. whole cloves 2 Tbsp. whole allspice 1 (three
inch) stick cinnamon, broken 2 blades mace, or 1 Tsp. ground mace Olive oil

Bring spice mixture to boiling; pour over stuffed peppers.  Let cool. To
each 3 peppers in jar or crock add about 1/2 cup olive oil.  Cover. Let
stand in cool place 10 days or longer before using.  To serve, remove
string, drain stuffed peppers.

Note:  Use remaining oil and spice mixture in salad dressings or for
marinade.
