for 30 minutes. Drain well and return to the bowl. Squeeze the roasted
garlic pulp from the heads into a bowl, taking care to remvoe any bits of
skin from the pulp. Add the roasted garlic to the currants, along with the
cream cheese and almonds. using an electric mixer, beat on low speed until
all ingredients are thoroughl combined. Season with salt and pepe.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. Can be refrigerated for up
to 5 days.
