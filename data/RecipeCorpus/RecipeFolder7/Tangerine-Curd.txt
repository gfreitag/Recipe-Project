Title: Tangerine Curd
Categories: Toppings
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 lb Butter
4 oz Sugar
8    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Tangerine juice
1/4 c  Lemon juice
2    Tangerines; Grated zest only
This makes a delicious filling for cakes and tarts and can also be used as
a spread for biscuits, scones or croissants.

COMBINE THE JUICES, ZEST, SUGAR and butter in a saucepan and bring to a
boil over medium heat. Beat the yolks in a bowl until liquid. Beat 1/4 of
the boiling liquid into the yolks and return the remaining liquid to a boil
over low heat. Beat the yolk mixture into the boiling liquid and continue
beating until it thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Do not allow the curd
to boil or it will scramble. Pour into a clean bowl, cover surface with
plastic wrap and chill.
