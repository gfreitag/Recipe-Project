Title: Pickled Herring
Categories: Pickles, Fish/sea
Yield: 10 servings
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Pickling spice
4    Bay leaves
6    Fillets salt herring
4 lg Onions, thinly sliced
1 c  White vinegar
1/2 c  Water
Wash the herring fillets well under running cold water.

In a glass or crockery bowl, place the fillets.  Cover the fillets with
cold water and refrigerate overnight (about 10 to 12 hours).

Rinse the fillets again and place them in a glass or enameled casserole or
baking pan.  Cover the herring with the sliced onions, making layers in
necessary.

Now make the marinade.  In a saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, sugar,
pickling spice, and bay leaves.  Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.
Cook for 3 to 5 minutes until the sugar is dissolved.  Cool slightly and
pour over the herring fillets.  Cover and place in a cool spot or
refrigerate and marinate for 2 to 3 days before serving.

Remove the herring fillets from the marinade and slice into bite-size
pieces.  Place the pieces in a serving bowl.  Remove the bay leaves from
the marinade. Mix the marinade and onions with the herring pieces, and
serve.  Makes 10 to 12 servings.

ADVICE FROM MAMA:  While ny father used an old-fashioned enameled pan in
which to soak and marinate the herring, I prefer to use those nice plastic
containers that come in different shapes and sizes, each with its own lid.
They're manufactured by Rubbermaid and sold in grocery stores and hardward
stores.  Sometimes progress is great.
