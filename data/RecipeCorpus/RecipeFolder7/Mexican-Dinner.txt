*DIRECTIONS*

Prepare the sauce by browning the onions and garlic on the oil.  Add the
remaining ingredients and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Tear off four 12 inch lengths of extra wide aluminum foil. On each length
of foil place 1/4 of the meat, top with 1/4 of the vegetables and pour over
1/4 of the sauce.  Bring the edges of the foil up and leaving room for the
expansion of the steam, seal well with a double fold wrap. Turn ends
tightly.  Place the packets on a preheated gas barbecue over medium heat
and cook until the meat is tender (1 to 1-1/2 hours), turning the packets
frequently.

When the packets are ready to serve, cut open and top each with 1/4 of the
cheese and green onion.  Serves 4.
