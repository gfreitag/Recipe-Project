Categories: Sauces, Mexican, Salsa
Yield: 1 servings
1 pn Sugar
Salt, to taste
2 c  Tomatoes, canned, with juice
1 sm Onion
2    Chile serrano
Now are we talking about the mild, Old El Paso-type green chiles (which are
a mild sort of chile poblano), or are we talking about jalapenos and
serranos?  It makes a buncha difference.  Salsa picante (which is what we
mean when we talk about "salsa" down here) is made with one or both of the
last two.  Acting on the presumption that it's salsa picante that you mean,
here's a recipe.  One serrano equals two jalapenos.  If you use jalapenos,
removing the veins from the inside will make it less hot.

Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend until finely
chopped.  Pour into a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer
30 minutes.  Cool slightly, pour into a pint jar, and refrigerate, or
process in a boiling water bath 10 minutes (in which case reduce the
cooking time the same amount). This sauce will keep three to four weeks in
the refrigerator. Cooking Texas Style Candy Wagner & Sandra Marquez
