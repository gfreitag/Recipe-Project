Title: No Pain Salsa
Categories: Sauces, Mexican, Salsa
Yield: 6 servings
1 lg Handful fresh cilantro OR
2 tb Dry cilantro
1/2    Clove of garlic
1 tb Lemon juice
14 1/2 oz Red Gold tomatoes
L large onion
3    Or 4 bannana peppers (not
-hot!)
Put into blender and blast until its chopped up real good. This makes about
a pound of salsa.  In fact it fits into an empty Sams Choice Salsa jar just
fine.  She also sometimes puts green peppers into the recipe which doesn't
make it hot either. This recipe satisfies my need for salsa, however, I
like it hot sometimes myself.
