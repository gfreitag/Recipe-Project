Title: Menudo Estilo Norteno
Categories: Soups/stews, Mexican
Yield: 6 servings
3    Cloves garlic, peeled
1 1/2 c  Canned hominy
6    Peppercorns
1 ts Oregano
2 ts Salt, or to taste
1    Calf's foot (1 to 1-1/2 lb)
4 qt Water
2 lb Honeycomb tripe
3 lg Chiles anchos
1    Large onion
2    Canned, peeled green chiles
Cut the calf's foot into four pieces.  Cut the tripe into small squares.
Put them into the pan with the onion, garlic, peppercorns, salt, and water.
Cover and bring to a boil.  Lower the flame, open the windows(!) and simmer
uncovered for about 2 hours, or until the tripe and foot are just tender
but not too soft.

Meanwhile, toast the chiles anchos well on a dry skillet, turning them from
time to time until the skin is charred.  Slit them open (wearing rubber
gloves, if you like keeping your skin) and remove the seeds and veins.
Grind them dry to a fine powder.  Add it to the pot as the meat is cooking.

Remove the pieces of the calf's foot from the pan, and when they are cool
enough to handle, strip off the fleshy parts.  Chop them roughly and return
them to the pan.  Add the hominy and continue cooking the menudo slowly,
still uncovered, for another two hours.  Adjust the salt to taste.

Sprinkle with oregano and serve.
