Boil tomatillos in water with garlic,chiles,salt and pepper until
soft,about 15-20 minutes.  puree cooked sause in blender to liquefy.while
blending,add washed cilantro leaves.set aside. the sauce yield is about
2and1/2 cups.it will thicken upon standing and you may need to thin with
chicken stock.  simmer chicken in lightly salted water until tender about
10-15 minutes.cool chicken will be slightly undercooked.shred cooked
chicken and then,just prior to serving,heat in 1 cup chicken stock.this
will heat chicken without overcooking.    in medium skillet,heat oil to 300
degrees.pass tortillas into hot oil for a few seconds to soften and
seal.remove carefully and set aside between paper towels.do this just prior
fill softened tortillas with shredded chicken and 1-2
to assembly
tablespoons sauce.roll up and place seam-side-down in casserole.pour green
sauce over top and garnish with sour cream and cheese. place in 375-degree
oven 5-8 minutes or just long enough to melt cheese. note:sauce may be made
a day in advance,but the dish is best when chicken is freshly prepared.
