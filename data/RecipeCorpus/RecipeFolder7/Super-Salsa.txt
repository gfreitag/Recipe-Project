Title: Super Salsa
Categories: Sauces, Salsa
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Salt
1/4 c  Chopped Garlic
1/4 c  Cornstarch
Water
4 qt Peeled & Chopped Tomatoes
2 c  Chopped Onion
1 c  Chopped Jalapenos
1/4 c  Sugar
Combine vegetables and seasonings in a large saucepan. Dissolve cornstarch
in just enough water to make a smooth paste; add to vegetable mixture and
stir thoroughly. Simmer 45 minutes. Refrigerate. Recipe can be halved.

To can, place in individual jars and process 10 minutes in boiling water
bath.

NOTE: To aid in peeling tomatoes, place each tomato in hot water for a few
moments just before attempting to peel.

You can halve the entire recipe if you want, but if so, be sure to halve
the Jalapeno & garlic! This is easy and VERY tasty!... I'm not much into
super hot salsa either, but I usually decrease the Jalapeno & Garlic to
make this recipe just strong enough to make me sweat!! ;)
