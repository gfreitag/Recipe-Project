Title: Apricot Preserves
Categories: Spreads, Preserve
Yield: 12 servings
Juice of 1 lemon
1 1/2 pk "Einsiedehilfe" ('Preserving
-Aid') dissolved in
4 kg Pitted, very ripe apricots
-(8 lbs 12 oz)
3 1/4 kg Sugar (7 lbs)
hot water

Cook apricots and sugar to setting point, continually skimming off foam.
Shortly before done, add lemon juice.  Remove from heat. Stir in
'Preserving Aid' dissolved in hot water.  Pour into hot, dry, sterilized
jars. Seal jars with cellophane the top of which has been dipped in rum and
smooth the overhang over the jars' necks, tying with thin twine.

Makes 12 half-liter jars and one quarter-liter jar.  (Between 13 and 14 1
pint jars).

"Einsiedehilfe" ('Preserving Aid') is sold (in Austria) in 15 gram packages
and consists of 65 percent sugar and 35 percent benzoic acid.

To test for setting point:  Spoon a little of the conserve onto a chilled
saucer. Leave for a few minutes - then hold saucer upside down. If conserve
doesn't run, then setting point has been reached.
