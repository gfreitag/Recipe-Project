Categories: Cakes
Yield: 6 servings
1 c  Sugar
1 tb Grated orange peel
5    Eggs, room temperature
2 c  Flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Soft butter
-----------------------------------GLAZE-----------------------------------
3 tb Powdered sugar
2 tb Orange juice
2 tb Lemon juice
1. Set the oven to the lowest rack, and preheat to 350F.

2. Grease and flour a 9 x 5 loaf pan. Mix flour, poppy seeds and salt
together and set aside.

3. In a large bowl, cream the butter and eggs, one at a time. Beat well
until light and fluffy and the batter has increased in size. Fold in the
flour mixture, one third at a time. Pour into the pan.

4. Bake 60 minutes or until lightly browned. If the cake browns too quickly
shield with foil the last 10 minutes.

5. Cool pan on rack for 10 minutes. Remove from the pan, and cool and then
brush with the glaze. Let the cake stand 1-2 days for the best flavor.
