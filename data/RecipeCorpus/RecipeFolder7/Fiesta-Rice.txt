Title: Fiesta Rice
Categories: Rice/grains, Mexican
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
3 c  Cooked rice
1 md Onion finely chopped
1/2 sm Green pepper, chopped
3 tb Margarine or butter
16 oz Stewed tomatoes
Cook and stir onion and green pepper in margarine in 10 inch skillet until
onion is tender.  Stir in tomatoes, salt, pepper and rice.   Simmer
uncovered over low heat until hot, about 15 minutes. My husband likes dry
rice as well, I haven't timed it when I make this so you may need to cook
it longer to get it to the consistency you want it.
