1 ts Baking powder
9 oz Hazelnuts
5 oz Butter
6 oz Powdered sugar
-------------------------------FOR THE GLAZE-------------------------------
1 tb Hot water
A few whole hazelnuts
4 oz Powdered sugar
1 ts Rum
1.  Grind the hazelnuts and set aside.

2. Separate the eggs and beat the yolks with the butter until creamy. Mix
the flour with the baking powder, add the ground nuts and then add all of
this to the egg yolk mixture.

3. Beat the egg whites until very stiff; fold into the flour-egg yolk
mixture carefully by hand. Grease muffin tins and fill the cups half full
with batter.

4. Bake at moderate heat (325F) for 25 minutes. Don't open the oven door or

VARIATION: Cut the cakes twice with a sharp knife and fill with apricot
marmalade. Put them back together and glaze and decorate as before.
