Categories: Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1 pn Nutmeg
27 oz Apricots, fresh
3 oz Butter
Cinnamon sugar
Sugar cubes
1 3/4 lb Potatoes
1/3 lb Flour
1 1/3 oz Cream of wheat
2    Eggs
12 oz Butter
1 ts Salt
1. On the day before, cook and peel and grate the potatoes. Mix in the
flour, cream of wheat, eggs butter, salt and nutmeg. Knead well and roll
out on a well floured board, about 1 cm thick and cut into 3 x 3 inch
squares. Wash the apricots and remove the stones. Put a cube of sugar in
place of the stone, put the apricot back together and place in the middle
of the square. Fold the dough over and with well-floured hands knead it
into a dumpling.

2. Finish all squares the same way. Bring a pot of water to a boil (with a
pinch of salt) and slide in the dumplings and let them simmer (don't let
them get stuck on the bottom) for about 6-8 minutes. Shake the pot gently
so they don't get stuck. They are done when they drop to the bottom. Serve
them hot ripped open at once with cinnamon sugar on top.
