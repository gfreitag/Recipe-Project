Title: Heart Healthy Pie Crust
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 8 servings
2 c  Unbleached flour
1/3 c  Olive oil
1/4 c  Water -- ice cold
Preheat oven at 350.  Prepare a 9" pie pan with cooking spray and
flour. Place flour in a bowl and drizzle with oil.  Use a pastry
blender to evenly distribute the oil and produce a mixture the
consistency of coarse cornmeal.  Sprinkle on the water, 1 tablespoon
at a time, and continue mixing until you can gather the dough into a
ball.  Roll the dough into a 11" circle onto a floured surface.
Patch any cracks that may form, but otherwise try not to handle the
dough more than necessary.  Transfer the dough to a pie plate.  Trim
the dough, leaving a 1" overhang.  Crimp the overhanging dough into a
decorative edge.  Chill the crust 20 minutes. Fill and bake according
to your pie recipe directions.
