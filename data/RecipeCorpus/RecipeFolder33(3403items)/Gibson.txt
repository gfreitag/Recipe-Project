Title: Gibson
Categories: Mixed drink, Beverages, Alcohol
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 oz Gin
1/2 oz Dry vermouth
1    Pearl onion
Fill a mixing glass with ice. Pour in gin and dry vermouth. Stir (or
shake) and strain into a martini glass. Garnish with a pearl onion.

As you can see, a Gibson is a martini with a pearl onion instead of an
olive. To make a dry or extra dry Gibson, follow the recipes for dry
and extra dry martinis, substituting the pearl onion garnish for the
olive.
