Recipe by: I Love Popcorn Preparation Time: 0:20 Preheat oven at 350.
Spread coconut in a large baking pan and toast for 8 to 10 minutes in
oven. Stir it 3 or 4 times so it toasts evenly.  To make syrup,
combine sugar, salt, corn syrup, margarine, and water in a 2 quart
saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar
dissolves. Continue to boil gently until the mixture reaches 270 on a
candy thermometer. Remove from heat and stir vanilla.  Pour the syrup
over warm popped corn, coconut and pineapple, and stir with a spoon
until all kernels are coated. Shape like chocolate bars.
