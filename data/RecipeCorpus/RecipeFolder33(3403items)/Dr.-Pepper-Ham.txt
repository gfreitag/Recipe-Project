Title: Dr. Pepper Ham
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 servings  The ingredients are very simple...

1 ham, any size (preferably natural ham on the bone, but processed
works
well, too.) 1 Dr. Pepper (3 ltr. size)

Line a deep, round roasting pan with aluminum foil.  Score the ham on
all sides approximately 1/2 to 1" deep, depending on the size of the
ham. Then, place the ham in the roasting pan.  Pour Dr. Pepper over
the ham liberally, allowing it to soak into the scores.  Then cover
the ham with aluminum foil and place in a 350 degree oven.  Every
half hour, remove the pot from the oven, turn the ham over, and
resoak with Dr. Pepper. Let the ham cook a minimum of 3 1/2
hours...more for a larger ham. Remove from the pot and serve.

The carbonation cooks away.  The secret is that the main ingredient
in Dr. Pepper is prune juice and other fruit juices which cook down
into the meat. It doesn't taste fruity, though.  It just makes the
sweetest, juiciest ham you have ever tasted.

Barry's notes:  The ham was so-so.  The family was not impressed nor
was I. Submitted By BARRY WEINSTEIN   On   07-31-95
