* Use a blender or food processor for this recipe.

Put all ingredients in blender and turn to puree mode until of desired
consistency. (Make only about 2 servings at one time so the blender
will not be overfilled.) If using a food processor, use the steel
knife to process; 8-10 seconds will be sufficient.

Serve in a tall glass.
