Categories: Appetizers, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
4 lg Artichokes, fresh
3/4 c  Sun-dried tomatoes
1 sm Eggplant, peeled & diced
2 c  Vegetable stock
1/4 c  Onion, chopped
1 tb Basil, chopped
1 tb Oregano, chopped
2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
1/4 ts Black pepper
Prepare the artichokes by washing under running water, pulling off the
tough outer leaves & trimming the stem so that it can stand upright.
Steam until a petal near the centre pulls out easily, depending on
the size of the artichoke, this can take anywhere from 25 to 40
minutes. Remove from steamer.

Halve artichokes lengthwise, remove & discard the centre petals & the
fuzzy centres.  Remove outer leaves & reserve.  Trim out the hearts &
chop finely.  Set aside.

Pour boiling water over the sun-dried tomatoes & let stand for 10
minutes before draining.  Set aside.  Meanwhile, simmer the eggplant
in the stock for 10 minutes, drain.

Blend the eggplant, tomatoes & the rest of the ingredients in a
processor until smooth.  Stir in the artichoke hearts.  Arrange
artichoke leaves on a serving platter.  Spoon one teaspoon of the dip
onto the wide end of each leaf & serve.
