Title: GAME HENS WITH SAFFRON AND WALNUT SAUCE - Bon Appetit
Categories: Bon appetit, Main dish, Poultry, Game
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 c  (about) canned low-salt
-chicken broth
1/4 ts Saffron threads
2 c  Walnuts
2    Garlic cloves
1/2    Jalapeno chili, seeded
1 ts Ground coriander
1 1/2 tb White wine vinegar
2 tb Olive oil
3    1 3/4-lb game hens, halved
Fresh cilantro sprigs
Pomegranate seeds (opt.)
Combine 1/4 C broth and saffron in small saucepan. Bring to simmer;
remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes.

Puree nuts, garlic, jalapeno and coriander in processor until mixture
resembles paste and oil begins to separate from nuts, stopping
occasionally to scrape down sides of processor. With processor
running, add saffron mixture, then vinegar. Add 3/4 C broth. Transfer
to saucepan. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill.)

Preheat oven to 500'F. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high
heat. Add hens in batches; cook until golden, placing another skillet
atop hens to flatten for even browning, about 3 minutes per side.
Place hens in roasting pan. Roast until just cooked through, about 12
minutes.

Stir sauce over low heat until just warm. Thin to sauce consistency
with additional broth if necessary. Place 1 game hen half on each of
6 plates. Spoon sauce over. Garnish with cilantro and pomegranate
seeds, if desired, and serve.
