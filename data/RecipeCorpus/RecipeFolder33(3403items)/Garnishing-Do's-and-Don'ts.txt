The key word to remember when choosing a garnish is 'complimentary'.
The garnish should compliment the food it is placed with, not only in
color, but in texture, size and taste.  The garnish around a main
dish should never mask or overpower the flavor of the food being
presented. When carefully selected and well prepared, food will be
attractive by virtue of its own natural goodness.  A cook who wants
the meal to look as good as it tastes and taste as good as it looks
will learn to think color, size, texture and shape when choosing the
best garnish for adding a new dimension to the food and to the whole
meal. Good food, well prepared, coupled with good design involving
color, form and pleasing combinations all add up to a successfully
garnished meal. Garnishes, as a rule, should not only be edible and
attractive, they should also be tasty. As with most rules, there are
exceptions; when using a garnish around a main dish such as a rib
roast, leg of lamb, ham, etc., it is permissilbe to use uncooked
vegetables such as beets and turnips. Fresh flowers and fresh leaves
are also in good taste when they are used properly. Plastic leaves
and flowers will do little if anything at all, to enhance the
appearance of food, so it is a good rule to stay away from anything
artificial when garnishing.
