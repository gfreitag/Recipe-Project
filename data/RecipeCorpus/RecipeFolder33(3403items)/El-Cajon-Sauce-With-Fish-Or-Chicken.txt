Title: El Cajon Sauce With Fish Or Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Fresh dill -- chopped
1/2 c  Fresh parsley -- chopped
1    Garlic clove -- minced
1    Egg white -- hard-cooked
1/4 ts Dry mustard
2 tb Lemon juice
1/4 ts Black pepper
1/2 c  Olive oil
4    Sun-dried tomatoes -- drain,
Chop
4    Fish fillets -- *see note
* Use this sauce on broiled fish fillets or on poached chicken. To
cook any firm-fleshed white fish: brush with melted margarine and
broil until fish flakes easily with fork -- usually takes only 5
minutes for a 1/2-inch thick fillet.

SAUCE: 1. Chop the dill and parsley very finely. Mince the garlic.
Chop the hard-boiled egg white very finely. Drain the sun-dried
tomatoes and chop finely. 2. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl
except for oil. Blend well with a whisk; slowly pour in the oil while
continuing to whisk the mixture. Set aside while broiling fish or
poaching chicken. 3. Place the broiled fish or poached chicken on
serving plates and place about 1/4 of the sauce on each plate. Serve
immediately.
