FOR CRUST: Preheat oven to 350F. Finely grind graham crackers with
sugar in processor. Add 2 1/2 T rum and process until crumbs are just
moist, adding more rum by 1/2 teaspoonfuls if mixture is dry. Using
paper towel as aid, press crumb mixture onto bottom of 9
inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4 inch-high sides. Bake crust
until dry and slightly puffed, about 12 minutes. Cool on rack.
Maintain oven temperature.

FOR FILLING: Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar in
large bowl until smooth. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating just until
blended after each addition. Mix in extract. Pour filling into crust.
Bake cake until filling begins to puff and crack around edges and
center moves only slightly when shaken, about 40 minutes. Remove cake
from oven; maintain oven temperature.

FOR TOPPING: Mix sour cream, sugar and rum in small bowl. Spread
topping evenly over hot cheesecake. Bake 5 minutes. Transfer cake to
rack and cool completely. Cover cake with foil and refrigerate
overnight.

Run knife around pan sides to loosen cake. Release pan sides. Overlap
mango slices decoratively atop cake. Stir jam in small saucepan over
low heat until melted. Brush jam over fruit.
