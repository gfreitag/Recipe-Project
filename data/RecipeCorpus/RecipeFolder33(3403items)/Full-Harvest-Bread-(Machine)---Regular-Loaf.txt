Rather than sweet, this loaf is a full-bodied squash bread,
reminiscent of acorn squash.  The pumpkin seeds are a wonderful,
distinctive touch; they give the bread crunch along with a special
taste of autumn.

Success Hints
-------------

Be sure to use plain canned pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling).

Use regular or rapid bake cycle.
