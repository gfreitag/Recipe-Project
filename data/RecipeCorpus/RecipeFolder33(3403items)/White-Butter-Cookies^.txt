Title: White Butter Cookies^
Categories: Cake/cookie, Oldies, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Butter
1 c  Lard
3 c  Sugar
2    Eggs
1 c  Sour cream
1/2 ts Baking soda
2 ts Vanilla
Flour
Cream butter, lard and sugar. Add eggs and sour cream; mix well. Sift
together flour and baking soda; add to mixture. Mix well, roll out on
floured board and cut into any shape. Bake in moderate oven for about
10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Makes over 100 cookies, but
is that enough? Many of the recipes in this collection did not
contain amounts or oven temperatures. I have typed them in as they
appear in the book, typos and all.
