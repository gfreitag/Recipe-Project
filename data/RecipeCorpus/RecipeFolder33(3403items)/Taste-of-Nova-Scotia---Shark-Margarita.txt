Title: Taste of Nova Scotia - Shark Margarita
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Bbq/grill, Canadian
Yield: 8 servings
8    Shark steaks, 1-inch thick
1/3 c  Lime juice
1 ts Lime rind, grated
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1/4 ts Ground ginger
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
1 ts Pepper, freshly ground
1 tb Liquid honey, or maple syrup
Rinse shark in cold water and pat dry. In a large bowl, combine lime
juice and rind, garlic,  ginger, vegetable oil, pepper and honey.

Add shark, stirring to coat well. Cover with plastic wrap and
marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes or refrigerate for up to
1 hour, turning shark occasionally.

Drain shark, reserving marinade. Grill shark steaks 4-inches from
medium-hot coals on a barbecue, or broil in oven on a medium-high
setting, brushing with reserved marinade, for 5 to 6 minutes per side.

Cooking with medium heat, not high, is important in order to keepthe
fish from toughening and drying out.
