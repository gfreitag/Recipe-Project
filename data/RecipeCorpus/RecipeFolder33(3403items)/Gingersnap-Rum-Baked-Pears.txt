Use enough gingersnaps to equal about 1/2 to 3/4 cup crumbs. Crush
gingersnaps in blender or food processor. Add half the pecans and
pulse just to chop. Toast the remaining pecans (or use untoasted ) as
garnish. Add 1 teaspoon margarine (melted), 1 teaspoon rum, and 1
teaspoon orange juice. Pulse 1-2 times only. Wash pears, peel, halve,
and core. Place in shallow baking dish, cut side up. Place the crumb
mixture into each pear cavity, dividing equally. Dot with remaining
margarine. Drizzle the remaining rum and orange juice over the
filling in pears. Pour hot water to a depth of about 1/4 inch in
baking dish. Place dish in preheated 350-degree oven and bake for 20
minutes or until golden brown. Remove from dish with slotted spoon
and place 2 halves on each serving plate. Garnish with remaining
pecan halves. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on each plate.
Garnish with a few perfect raspberries if desired.
