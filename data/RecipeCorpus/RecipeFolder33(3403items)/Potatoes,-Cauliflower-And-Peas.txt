10 oz Frozen green peas
1/2 ts Ground turmeric
1 ts Ground cumin
3/4 ts Red pepper powder
1 ts Ground coriander

Cook the cauliflower, potatoes and peas, separately, in boiling water
until almost tender.  Drain each vegetable and set aside to dry on
paper towels. In a bowl combine the turmeric, cumin, red pepper
powder and coriander. Heat the oil in large non-stick skillet over
moderate heat. Add the spice mixture to the pan.  Stir-fry for about
5 seconds to release flavors. Add the cauliflower, potatoes and peas,
and stir fry until they are very lightly browned.  Add the tomatoes
and continue cooking over low heat for 1 to 2 minutes, crushing the
tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Add about 1/4 cup of water.
Reduce the heat to low.  If using frozen peas, add at this point.
Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 to 4 minutes or
until the vegetables are tender.  Add salt to taste. Garnish with
coriander leaves.  158 calories and 3 grams fat.
