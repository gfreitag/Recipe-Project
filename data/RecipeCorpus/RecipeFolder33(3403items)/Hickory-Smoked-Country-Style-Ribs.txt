Categories: Bbq/grill, Alcohol, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2    Recipes of spicy bbq shake
A double recipe of country
-style pork ribs
2    Onions minced
8    Garlic cloves minced
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1/2 c  Worcestshire sauce
plenty of freshly ground black pepper

Prepare the spicy bbq shake and the bourbon bbq sauce.

Rub the shake on all sides of the ribs and place them in a large bowl.
Distribute the minced onion and garlic evenly over the ribs.  Combine
the soy and worcestshire sauce and drizzle the mixture over the ribs,
tossing well.  Sprinkle with pepper. Marinate of 2 hours at room
temperature, or longer in the refrigerator.

Thirty minutes before cooking, soak 6 hickory wood chunks in water.
In a covered grill over a low fire, cook the ribs bone-side down for
3 hours, or until tender and juicy and deeply colored.  Add dampened
hickory wood chunks to the fire while cooking, and add more charcoal
as needed.  Baste the ribs with the barbecue sauce toward the end of
cooking.  Serve the cooked ribs with barbecue sauce on the side.
