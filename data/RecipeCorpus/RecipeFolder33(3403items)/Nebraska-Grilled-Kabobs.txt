Guests at Kay Kruger's backyard barbecues in Gordon, Nebraska (135
miles southeast of Rapid City, South Dakota), often create their own
kabobs. Kay completes the feast with a fruit salad and some garlic
bread.

1. In a 1-cup measure, stir together the vinegar, cooking oil, soy
sauce, ketchup, onion salt, garlic powder and pepper.

2. Place the meat in a plastic bag. Set in a bowl; pour marinade
atop. Seal bag.

3. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 24 hours. Drain, reserving
marinade.

4. Meanwhile, cook any vegetables that need precooking

5. Thread meat and fruits or vegetables alternately on 4- to 5-inch
skewers. Brush with reserved marinade.

6. Grill kabobs directly over medium-hot coals for 8 to 12 minutes or
till done, turning. Makes 4 or 5 servings.

Vegetable/fruit options: Choose from broccoli or cauliflower
flowerets, baby squash cut into 1/2-inch slices, halved tiny new
potatoes, baby carrots or fresh ears of corn, green onions or leeks
cut into 1-inch pieces. Or choose uncooked vegetables or fruits:
1-inch pieces of red or green sweet pepper, peeled and seeded papaya,
fresh pineapple or peeled jicama (Mexican potato), or apple wedges or
orange slices. Or choose fresh or frozen and thawed artichoke hearts
and pea pods.
