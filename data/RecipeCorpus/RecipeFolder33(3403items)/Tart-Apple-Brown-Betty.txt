Title: Tart Apple Brown Betty
Categories: Desserts, Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Bread crumbs
1/4 c  Margarine -- melted
4 c  Apple slices -- tart
1/2 c  Packed brown sugar
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
1    Lemon -- juice and peel
1/2 c  Apple juice
* Use whole grain bread to make the crumbs. Substitute 1-2 tablespoons
wheat germ for equal amount of crumbs if preferred.

1. Prepare apples: peel, core and slice thinly to equal 4 cups. Use
Granny Smith or other tart apples. 2. Grate the rind of 1/2 of the
lemon, being careful not to include any of the pith just below the
peel. Juice half the lemon, or all if it is a small lemon. 3. Mix
bread crumbs with melted margarine and blend. 4. Mix sugar with
nutmeg, lemon peel and juice; blend. 5. Grease a casserole dish with
margarine. Put a layer of crumbs on bottom, spread half the apples
atop then half the sugar mixture. Put the rest of the apples, then
the sugar and top with remaining crumbs. Add 1/2 cup very hot apple
juice or water. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for 40 minutes or
until done. Cover loosely with foil tent for first 20 minutes to
prevent crumbs browning too quickly.
