Put all the bouillon ingredients together in a saucepan.  Simmer for
30 minutes.  Strain and replace the liquid in the pan.  Add the
salmon, bring to the boil and boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat
and set aside; the salmon will continue to cook in the bouillon while
you make the mayonnaise. Put the eggs in a food processor or blender
with the mustard, salt and pepper.  Switch on and whilst blending,
pour in the oil and vinegar in a steady stream until the sauce
thickens. Add the chopped herbs. Check that the salmon is cooked
(10-12 minutes). Lift on to a serving dish. Garnish with sliced
cucumber and serve hot or cold with the mayonnaise.
