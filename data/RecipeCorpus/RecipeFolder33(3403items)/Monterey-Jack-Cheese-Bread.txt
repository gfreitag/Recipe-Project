Categories: Breads, Tex/mexican
Yield: 1 servings
4 oz Monterey jack cheese -- cut
In 1-inch cubes
3    Eggs
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 ts Dried rosemary
1/2 ts Dried basil
1 1/2 c  Buttermilk baking mix
1 tb Black olives -- chopped
1 tb Green chiles -- chopped
1 tb Dried tomatoes -- optional
* Substitute either cheddar or Swiss cheese for the Monterey Jack.

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease an 8-inch pie plate. 2. Cut
cheese into 1-inch cubes. Fit the steel knife blade into the work
bowl. Process cheese until chopped into 1/4 inch pieces. Remove 1/2
cup cheese from bowl and set aside for topping. 3. Add eggs, milk,
rosemary, basil and biscuit mix to cheese in bowl. Process until
batter is smooth, 10-15 seconds, stopping machine once to scrape down
sides of bowl with rubber spatula. 4. Pour into prepared pie plate.
Sprinkle top of batter with remaining cheese. Bake until bread is
light golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cut into wedges to serve. Makes
4-6 servings.

NOTE: I also add one or all of the following: tablespoon of chopped
green chiles, tablespoon of chopped black olives, or a tablespoon of
chopped sun-dried tomatoes (packed in oil or rehydrated). If using
these optional ingredients, add after processing other ingredients.
Stir in gently.
