Title: Prawns with Chimichurri Sauce
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Salsa/sauce, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
2    To 10 cloves garlic, peeled
& coarsely chopped
1    Red jalapeno pepper, stemmed
-seeded and coarsely chopped
1/4 c  Fresh oregano leaves
1 c  Fresh parsley leaves
1/4 c  Red-wine or sherry vinegar
1/2 c  Olive oil
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 lb Jumbo prawns
1. Prepare the garlic.  Traditionally this is a garlicky sauce, but
the amount of garlic used would be according to personal taste.

2. Combine the garlic and jalapeno in a food processor and mince
finely. Add the oregano and parsley and pulse to a fine chop.  Add
the vinegar, olive oil and salt, processing until smooth and
emulsified. (The sauce can be used immediately; or pour into a jar,
cover and refrigerate until ready to use.)

3. Remove about 1/3 cup of the sauce to use as a baste for the prawns.
Prepare a charcoal or gas grill.  Place prawns on a well-oiled grill,
4 to 6 inches from the source of heat.  Baste and cook about 3 to 4
minutes per side, or until prawns are pink and cooked through.

4. Serve with the remaining sauce on the side.

Note: The sauce can also be used with beef, chicken or pork.
