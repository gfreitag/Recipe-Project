One of life's simple pleasures!  This recipe blends the fruit right
into the loaf unless you add the raisins in mid-cycle; it's your
choice.

Success Hints
------------- For whole raisins in the
bread, add fruit at the beep on the fruit and nut cycle or after the
first knead.

If using the rapid bake cycle, add raisins with other ingredients.

This recipe can be made with the regular, rapid or delayed time bake
cycles.
