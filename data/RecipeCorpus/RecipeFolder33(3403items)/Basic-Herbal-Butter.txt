Categories: Herbs/spice, Dips/spread
Yield: 1 servings
4 tb Unsalted butter
1 tb To 2 T fresh herbs chopped
Or 1 t dried herbs
1.  Beat the softened butter until creamy.  Blend in the chopped
herbs. 2. Place the butter on waxed paper and form ti into a roll or
other shape with a flat-bladed knife.  (A pastry bag can be used to
create more intricate shapes.) 3. Allow the butter to rest in the
refrigraaator for at least two hours so the butter will completely
absorb the flavor of the herb. Note: For an elegant touch, reserve
some fresh herbs to decorate the top of the butter before serving.
