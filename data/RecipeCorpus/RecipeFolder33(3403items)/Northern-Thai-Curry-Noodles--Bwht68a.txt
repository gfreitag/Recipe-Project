in 1 cup thick coconut milk over low heat until fragrant. At the same

put a desired amount of noodles in the serving dish. Drizzle about
1/2 Tbsp coconut milk. Top with the curry and sprinkle chopped
cilantro, chopped onions, fried rice noodles,lime juice and ground
chilies to taste. Makes about 6 servings.
