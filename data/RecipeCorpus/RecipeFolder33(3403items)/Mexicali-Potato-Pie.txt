1/4 ts Red pepper flakes

with 2 inches salted water, bring the water to a boil, and simmer the
potatoes, covered for 30 to 40 minutes, or until they are tender.
Drain the potatoes and let them cool until they can be handled.  Peel

In a small skillet cook the onion with the red pepper flakes in 2
tbsp of the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until it is softened,
add the mixture to the potato with the eggs, cheese, chilies, olives,
lemon juice salt and pepper and combine the mixture well.  Coat the
bottom and side of a 9" pie plate, sprinkle with the remaining 3 tbsp
crumbs.  Spread the potato mixture in the pie plate, sprinkle it with
the remaining 3 tbsp crumbs and drizzle the remaining 2 tbsp oil over
the top.  Bake the pie in the middle of the oven for 1 hour, let it
cool on a rack for 5 minutes, and cut it into wedges. Serve the pie
warm or at room temperature.
