Categories: Meats, Chinese, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 lb Pork, shredded
1 tb Cornstarch
1 tb Wine or Sherry
3    Eggs, beaten
Oil for frying
1    Garlic clove, minced
1 c  Chinese cabbage, shredded
2    Green onions, shredded
1/2 c  Bamboo shoots, shredded
1/2 c  Mushrooms, sliced
1 c  Hoisin sauce
1 tb Soy sauce
1/2 ts Sugar
MMMMM----------------------CHINESE PANCAKES---------------------------
2 c  Flour
3/4 c  Boiling water
Sesame oil
Make the pancakes by placing the flour in a bowl and making a well in
the center.  Add water, stirring quickly with a fork until a dough
has formed. It shouldn't be too sticky and you may not need all the
water. Turn dough onto lightly floured board, knead until smooth,
adding more flour if necessary.  Place dough in bowl and cover. Allow
to rest 30 min.
Moisten hands with oil.  Pull off plum sized pieces and flatten.
Brush each ball with oil. Roll ball into a 6 inch circle. Repeat with
all dough. Fry each pancake until 1 side puffs up. Turn and repeat on
other side. Let cool.

Marinate pork one hour. in cornstarch, salt, pepper, sherry and enough
beaten egg to moisten it.  Heat wok, add oil. Stir fry pork and
slightly beaten eggs, stirring so pieces separate.  Once eggs form
themselves into curds, remove and set aside. Add more oil to the wok
and lightly brown garlic. Add all vegetables, stir frying until just
cooked, about 3-4 min. Return meat and eggs to vegetables, add 2 ts
hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sugar, salt and pepper.  Combine well. In a
steamer, re-heat the pancakes. Spread each Chinese pancake with
hoisin sauce. Add a good 2 T of filling to bottom 1/2 of each pancake
and roll up like crepes.  Serve.

Source: I forget the name of the cookbook since it was before I
started keeping track of where a recipe came from, and I've since
given the book away, but it had all chinese recipes in it.
