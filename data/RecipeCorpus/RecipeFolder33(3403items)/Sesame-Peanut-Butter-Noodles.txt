Recipe from the famous Shun Lee restaurant in New York City-Chef
Michael Tong. * Use smooth or chunky peanut butter instead of sesame
paste if preferred. Use hot sauce instead of Szechaun chili paste if
preferred. 1-In a large saucepan, bring 6 cups of water to a boil.
Add the noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are
tender, 7 minutes or less. Drain and run under cold water so they are
thoroughly chilled and the strands are separated.  Drain thoroughly.
Turn the noodles into a bowl and toss with 1 teaspoon of sesame oil.
2-Spoon the sesame paste or peanut butter into a mixing bowl.
Gradually add the hot water. Stir in teh chili paste, sugar, garlic,
vegetable oil, soy sauce, vinegar, salt and 1 tablespoon sesame oil.
Mix until well combined. 3-Arrange the noodles on a serving dish.
Spoon the sauce over the noodles. Serve warm or cold. Recipe from
