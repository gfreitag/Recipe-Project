Title: Tuna-Rice Casserole w/Cheese
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Casseroles
Yield: 1 servings
2 cn Cheap water-pak Tuna
(grated, flake or chunk)
2 cn Cream of mushroom Soup
8 oz Shredded cheddar
2 c  Rice
1 qt Chicken broth
8 oz American cheese slices
1/2 ts White pepper
Cook rice in the chicken broth. While rice is cooking open the tuna
and use a fork to separate it from packed form into small pieces.
Transfer cooked rice to a large casserole dish and mix in tuna,
mushroom soup, shredded cheddar and white pepper. Place in a 325
degree oven for 20 minutes. Cover top of tuna-rice mixture with
American cheese slices and return to oven until cheese begins to
brown or 15 minutes.

At Uncle Dirty Dave's Kitchen we pop the casserole under a broiler
for a couple of minutes to really brown the cheese topping. Let
casserole sit for 15 minutes or so before serving. This allows dish
to "set" so you can serve it like cake or pie. Refrigerate leftovers;
nukes well. Simple and tasty, my favourite kind of dish.
