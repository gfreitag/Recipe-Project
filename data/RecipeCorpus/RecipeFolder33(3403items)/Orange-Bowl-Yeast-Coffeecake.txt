Title: Orange Bowl Yeast Coffeecake
Categories: Breads, Desserts
Yield: 2 servings
2 pk Yeast
1/4 c  Warm water
1/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Margarine
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Milk -- scalded
2 lg Eggs
1/4 c  Orange juice
4 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Packed brown sugar
2 tb Orange peel -- grated
1 c  Nuts -- walnuts or pecans
1. Sprinkle yeast in 1/4 cup warm (not hot) water. Let stand 5-10
minutes to soften. 2. In mixing bowl, combine 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup
softened margarine, salt and scalded milk. Cool to lukewarm. 3. Whisk
in eggs, orange juice and yeast. Gradually add flour to form a stiff
dough. You may not need all the flour. 4. Knead on floured surface
until smooth and satiny. This should take 3-5 minutes. Place in
greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover and let rise in warm
place until light and doubled in size, about 1 hour. 5. Cream 1/2 cup
margarine; add 1 cup brown (or white) sugar and orange peel. Set
aside. 6. Roll out half of dough on floured surface to a 12 x 8-inch
rectangle. Spread with half of orange filling; sprinkle with 1/2 of
chopped nuts. Start with 12-inch side and roll in a jelly-roll
fashion. Cut into twelve 1-inch slices. 7. Arrange slices 1 inch
apart on bottom and sides of well-greased 2-quart casserole or
oven-proof mixing bowl. Place remaining slices in center of dough.
Repeat with remaining dough to make second cake. 8. Cover and let
rise in warm place until light and doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
9. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for 35 minutes or until golden
brown. Invert immediately onto wire rack; let cool.

Yield: 2 cakes.
