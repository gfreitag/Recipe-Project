Yield: 6 servings
Shimizu BWHT68A
3    Very ripe plantains --
Peeled
And cut into 3 equal pieces
Crosswise -- then slice
Each
Into 3 pieces lengthwise
1/2 c  All purpose flour
1/2 c  Rice flour
1/4 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 tb White sesame seeds
1 3/4 c  Coconut milk
1/2 c  Sweetened coconut flakes
4 c  Oil for frying (approx.)
Heat oil in a large frypan or a wok over medium heat. Meanwhile,
combine all purpose flour, rice flour, sugar, salt, sesame seeds,
coconut milk and coconut flakes in a bowl and stir to mix well. Drop
a few pieces of plantains at a time into the bowl and coat each piece
well with a spoon. The batter should be on the thicker side so it can
cling to the bananas. When the oil reaches the proper temperature,
carefully drop the plantains pieces in hot oil. Fry until medium
brown on both sides, turning occasionally. Drain on a cake rack over
a cookie sheet. Serve with hot or cold beverages. Makes 27 pieces.
NOTE: Try to find ripest plantains possible. If using regular
bananas, reduce sugar by 1 tbsp. and cut 4 pieces to a banana only.
Sweet potatoes and/or taro roots, cut french fries style (large
pieces) may also be used with or instead of bananas. Some Thai
grocery stores carries fresh Thai bananas called Kluay Nam Wa. That
is the best kind to use in this recipe.
