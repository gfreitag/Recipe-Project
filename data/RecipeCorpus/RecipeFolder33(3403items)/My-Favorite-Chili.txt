Title: My Favorite Chili
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Ground beef
3 tb Chili powder
6 oz V-8Â® vegetable juice
1/2 c  Chopped onions
32 oz Kidney beans -- drain and
Rinse
16 oz Italian tomatoes -- crushed
16 oz Mexican tomatoes -- stewed
1 ds Worcestershire sauce
Brown the ground beef and drain completely. Mix in chili powder and
onions and stir 2-3 minutes. Mix tomatoes and V-8 juice in large
heavy skillet with cover. Combine browned beef in pan with tomatoes.

Simmer, stirring  occasionally, for approximately 40 minutes. Add
drained and rinsed kidney beans and continue to simmer for 15-20
minutes longer. Cover and let set for up to 1 hour for flavors to
blend.

Serve with choice of sour cream, cheddar cheese, chopped green onions
or white onions and homemade cheese biscuits.

Serving Ideas : Serve with fresh apple slices, coleslaw, cheddar
biscuits.

NOTES : For spicier chili and a different taste, use the V-8 hot and
spicy juice. Worcestershire sauce is optional but recommended.

This recipe was developed many years ago when, as a Navy wife, I
often had to use the lowest price food and still get nutritional and
good-tasting meals prepared. We still love this and often have it
served with our favorite dishes of homemade coleslaw, biscuits made
with cheddar cheese and wheat germ, and some fresh crisp apple slices.
