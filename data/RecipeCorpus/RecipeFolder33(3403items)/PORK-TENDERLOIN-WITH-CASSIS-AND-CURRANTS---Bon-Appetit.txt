Categories: Bon appetit, Main dish, Meats
Yield: 2 servings
1/4 c  Dried currants
1 c  Canned low-salt chicken
-broth
1 c  Canned beef broth
5 tb Butter
1    10-oz pork tenderloin,
-trimmed of all fat
All purpose flour
1/2 c  Creme de cassis liqueur
3 tb Red wine vinegar
Place currants in small bowl. Pour enough warm water over to cover by
1 inch. Let stand 30 minutes. Drain. Set aside. Combine both broths
in medium saucepan and boil until reduced to 1 C, about 10 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375'F. Melt 2 T butter in heavy large skillet over
medium-high heat. Season pork with salt and pepper. Coat with flour;
shake off excess. Add to skillet. Cook until brown on all sides,
about 6 minutes. Transfer tenderloin to small baking pan (do not
clean skillet). Bake pork until thermometer inserted into center
registers 155'F, about 15 minutes. Tent with foil to keep warm.

Meanwhile, pour fat from skillet. Add currants, cassis and vinegar to
skillet and boil until liquid is reduced by half, scraping up any
browned bits, about 5 minutes. Add reduced broth mixture and boil
until liquid is reduced to scant 1/2 C and mixture is slightly
syrupy, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Gradually add remaining 3
T butter, whisking just until melted. Season to taste with salt and
pepper.

Cut pork crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange pork on plates
and spoon sauce over.
