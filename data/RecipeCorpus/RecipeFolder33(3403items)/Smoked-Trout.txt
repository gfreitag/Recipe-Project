Title: Smoked Trout
Categories: Fruit, Bbq/grill, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 ga Water
1 1/4 c  Salt
5 lb Trout fillets
1 lb Wood chips hickory/apple/oak
Dissolve salt in 1 gallon of water. Place fish in salt water and
marinate in refrigerator 1 hour. Remove trout, rinse and dry
thoroughly. In 2 quarts fresh water, soak wood chips for several
hours or overnight. Refrigerate the fish while soaking the chips.
Bring a covered grill (charcoal, gas or electric) to low heat. Cover
heated coals with 1/3 of the hickory chips. Place fish, skin side
down, on well greased grill about 4 6 inches from coals. Close grill
hood and open vent to circulate smoke. Add additional wood chips as
necessary. Smoke trout to 105-175 degrees approximately 1 hour or at
200 degrees 30-40 minutes. Trout is done when the cut surface is
golden brown and flakes easily with a fork.
