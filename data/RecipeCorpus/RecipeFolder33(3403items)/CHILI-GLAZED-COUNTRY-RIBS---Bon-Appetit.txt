Yield: 4 servings
6    Garlic cloves, unpeeled

3/4 c  Water
1 ts Dried oregano
1/2 ts Ground cumin
2 tb Cider vinegar
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
Pinch of ground cloves
2 1/2 lb Country-style pork ribs
1 1/2 tb Honey
Heat heavy medium skillet over low heat. Add garlic and cook until
tender and skin is blackened in places, turning occasionally, about
15 minutes. Remove from skillet; cool and peel. Add chilies to
skillet; toast until skin begins to blister, about 30 seconds per
side. Transfer chilies to large bowl. Add enough boiling water to
bowl to cover chilies. Let stand 20 minutes. Drain. Transfer chilies
and garlic to blender. Mix in 1/2 C water, oregano and cumin. Puree.
Measure 3/4 C chili puree into bowl (reserve remainder for another
use). Stir in vinegar, cinnamon and cloves. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. (Can be prepared 4 days ahead. Cover and chill.)

Place ribs in large pan. Coat ribs with half of chili mixture. Cover
and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 325'F. Drizzle remaining 1/4 C water around ribs.
Cover with foil and bake 1 hour, basting occasionally with pan
juices. Uncover ribs and continue cooking until very tender, basting
frequently, about 30 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 350'F. Mix
honey into remaining chili mixture. Brush glaze over ribs. Bake until
glaze is set, about 15 minutes.

*Chilies are available at Latin American markets and some
supermarkets.
