2 c  Mashed potatoes

1/4 c  Water
2 tb Shortening
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Flour

Combine water, 2 tablespoons shortening, salt and pepper in a medium
saucepan. Bring to a boil. Stir in flour. Cook and stir until mixture
forms a ball. Cool slightly, about 2 minutes. Beat in egg (dough will
be very thick). Add potatoes. Mix well. Drop by rounded
tablespoonfuls, a few at a time, into hot oil. Fry 3-5 minutes. Turn
