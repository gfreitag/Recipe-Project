Place ribs in a baking dish, bowl or heavy duty plastic bag.  Combine
other ingredients and pour over ribs.  Toss ribs so all are evenly
coated. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.  Remove ribs
from the sauce and place on smoker grid.  Baste with sauce before
cooking and once during cooking. * This sauce can be used on bone-in
ribs, just increase cooking time. CHARCOAL: Use 5-7 lbs. charcoal, 3
quarts hot water, 2 wood sticks and smoke 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours.
