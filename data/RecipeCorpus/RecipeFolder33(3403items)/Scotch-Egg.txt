Title: Scotch Egg
Categories: Scot/irish, Cheese/eggs, Snacks
Yield: 4 servings
12 oz Pork sausage
2 ts Parsley; finely chopped
4    Eggs
1 oz Flour
Salt & pepper to taste
4 oz Dried breadcrumbs
1    Egg; beaten
Oil for frying
Boil the eggs for 10 minutes.  Cool and remove the shells. Place the
sausage meat in bowl.  Add the chopped parsley and mix well; hands are
best.  Coat the eggs with the seasoned flour and cover completely
with a layer of sausage meat; wet hands help to mould it evenly. Dip
into the beaten egg and roll in the breadcrumbs.  Fry in deep fat
until golden brown.  Drain well on kitchen paper. Serve hot or cold.
Serves 4.
