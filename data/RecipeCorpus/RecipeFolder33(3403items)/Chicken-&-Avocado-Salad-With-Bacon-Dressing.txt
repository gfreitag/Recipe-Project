Categories: Main dish, Poultry, Salads
Yield: 6 servings
3 c  Chicken broth
6    Boneless skinless chicken
Breast halves
MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
8 sl Bacon -- cut in 1/2" pieces
1    Egg yolk -- hard boiled
2 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Dijon mustard
1/2 c  Oil
SALAD:
2    Avocado
2 tb Lemon juice
3/4 c  Celery -- thinly sliced
1/2 c  Green onion -- minced
Lettuce leaves
Tomato slices
In a skillet bring the broth to a boil, add the chicken breasts in one
layer, reducing the heat to keep the broth at a bare simmer, and
simmer them, turning once, for 7 minutes.  Remove the skillet from
the heat and let the chicken cool in the broth for 30 minutes.  To
make the dressing cook the bacon in heavy skillet over moderate heat,
stirring until it is crisp.  Transfer it to paper towels to drain and
reserve 2 tbsp of the fat. In a food processor blend the egg yolk,
lemon juice mustard, reserved bacon fat, oil and salt and pepper to
taste.  Add the bacon and blend the dressing for 5 seconds.  Transfer
the chicken with a slotted spatula to a cutting board, reserving the
broth for another use.  Pat chicken dry and cut it into bite size
cubes.  Cut the avocado into cubes and in a bowl combine it with the
lemon juice, chicken, celery, green onion and pour the dressing over
the mixture and toss the salad gently. Serve the salad on lettuce
lined plates and garnish with tomato slices.
