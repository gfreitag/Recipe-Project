Preheat oven at 450.  Prepare a baking sheet lined with foil with
cooking spray.  Rinse fillets; pat dry with paper towels.  In a small
covered saucepan cook the carrots in a small amount of boiling water
about 4 minutes or until nearly tender. Drain well.  To assemble each
package, fold each piece of waxed paper in half crosswise.  From
each, cut out a half heart shape 6" longer and 2" wider than fillets.
(The fold will be the center of the heart.)  Open each heart shape
piece of paper.  Place a fillet on the right half  of each heart,
tucking under any thin edges of the fillet. (If fillet is less than
1/2" thick, stack fillets to about 1/2" thickness.).  In a small
mixing bowl stir together mustard, honey, and lemon pepper seasoning.
Spread mustard mixture over fish portions. Top with the carrots and
onions.  Fold left of each heart over the fillet, matching edges.
Starting at the top of each heart, seal the packages by folding the
edges together in a double fold.  Fold only a small section at a time
to ensure a tight seal.  Then twist the tip of each heart to seal the
packages.  (The secret to a beautifully puffed papillote is a tight
seal.) Place the packages on a baking sheet.  Bake for 12 to 15
minutes or just until fillet begins to flake easily and the paper
puffs up (carefully open paper to check doneness.)  To serve, cut a
large X on the top of each package, then pull back the paper.
Transfer packages to dinner plates.
