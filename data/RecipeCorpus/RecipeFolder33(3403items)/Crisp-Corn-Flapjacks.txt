Title: Crisp Corn Flapjacks
Categories: Pcake/waffl, Nuts/grains, Breakfast
Yield: 5 servings
1 1/3 c  White Cornmeal

Most people mean "Pancakes" when they use the word "Flapjacks". There
is a difference. "Flapjacks" are cornmeal pancakes, not wheat cakes.

Preheat the griddle. Sift the flour. Place the cornmeal, salt, baking
soda and flour in a bowl. Cut the butter in using a pastry blender.
Combine the buttermilk and eggs and beat. Stir the liquid quickly
into the sifted ingredients. Make the cakes small for easy turning.
Beat the batter before each spoonful is placed on the griddle.
