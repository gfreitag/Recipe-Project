Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
2    Leeks -- white part only
1    Onion
3    Potatoes
2 tb Margarine
3 c  Chicken broth
2 c  Half and half
White pepper -- to taste
Salt -- to taste
1. Trim leeks and wash well to remove all sandy particles. Slice
white part of leeks, onion and potatoes into thin slices. 2. Melt
margarine in a large saucepan with lid. Saute leeks and onions until
tender; do not brown. 3. Add potatoes and chicken broth. Bring to a
boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover pan and simmer 15-20
minutes or until potatoes are tender. Let cool to room temperature.
4. Process soup in blender or food processor until smooth; blend in
about 3 batches to prevent overfilling blender. Pour puree into a
large bowl. Stir in half-and-half. 5. Refrigerate at least 2 hours.
Serve this soup cold, adding salt and pepper to taste if you wish. If
you wish to serve this warm, bring to serving temperature over a very
low heat; do not allow soup to boil.

Yield: about 5-6 servings.
