Title: Green Tomato Pickles From The South
Categories: Can/preserv, Healthy
Yield: 16 servings
Four 1-pint canning jars
7 lb Green tomatoes
1 c  Coarse salt -- non-iodized
4 c  Cider vinegar
2 c  Sugar
4 ts Whole cloves
4 ts Mace -- whole
2    Cinnamon sticks
* You will need 1 gallon sliced tomatoes for this recipe; about 7
pounds of green tomatoes are sufficient.

1. Wash, remove stem ends and slice enough tomatoes to yield 1
gallon. 2. Place half the sliced tomatoes in a large bowl, sprinkle
with 1/2 cup coarse salt, add remaining tomatoes and sprinkle with
remaining 1/2 cup salt. Cover and set aside overnight. 3. Drain
tomatoes very thoroughly; discard liquid. Heat 4 cups vinegar and 2
cups sugar to boiling in a heavy saucepan or kettle. Stir until sugar
is dissolved. 4. Make a spicebag by cutting a double thickness of
cheesecloth into a 10-inch square. Place the cloves, mace, and
cinnamon, which has been broken into smaller pieces, onto the
cheesecloth. Tie the corners to secure spices from becoming loose. 5.
Add spice bag to hot vinegar mixture; add drained tomatoes and simmer
for 10 minutes. 6. Immediately pack into drained, sterilized jars;
seal tightly.

Yield: About 4 pints pickles.
