Title: Black Beans With Saffron Rice (Vegetarian)
Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Pasta/rice
Yield: 8 servings
2 c  Black beans
4 c  Water
1    Onion -- halved
3    Bay leaves
6    Garlic cloves -- whole
2 c  Rice
1/3 ts Saffron
Garnish:
6    Tomatoes -- seeded and
Chopped
2 c  Onions -- chopped
6 tb Olive oil
2 tb Wine vinegar
1 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
4 tb Fresh basil -- or parsley
Black pepper
* Use Vidalia onions for the garnish if available. If not, use other
sweet onions such as Maui, Walla Walla, Texas 1015, or Imperial Sweet.

1. Rinse and sort the beans. Put into a large, heavy pot with lid.
Cover with the 4 cups water. Bring to a boil, cover, and remove from
heat. Let stand for 2 hours.

2. Add the halved onions, bay leaves and garlic to beans. Place over
low heat and cook, covered, until beans are tender; about 1-1/2 to 2
hours. Check water and add more if needed while cooking.

3. Remove and discard the onion, bay leaves and garlic cloves. Keep
beans warm.

4. Prepare the garnish about 1 hour before serving. Place the
tomatoes and onion into a serving bowl. Add the olive oil, vinegar,
cumin, cayenne, parsley or basil and black pepper to taste. Toss to
blend.

5. Bring 4 cups water to boiling in a heavy saucepan with tight
fitting lid. Add the rice and saffron threads (do not use too much
saffron). Stir well, cover, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes or
until the rice has absorbed all the water.

6. To serve, place the rice, black beans, and the garnish into
separate bowls. Guests can serve themselves by placing a serving of
rice, topping with the beans and lastly with the garnish on their
plates.

* Cut this recipe in half if you wish. It is really best not to
double this as cooking times will vary depending on the size and
thickness of cookware used.
