Title: Wheat Germ And Honey Bread For Abm
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 pk Yeast
1 c  Whole-wheat flour
2 c  Bread flour
1 tb Wheat germ
1 tb Vital gluten
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Honey
1 tb Margarine
1 c  Buttermilk
1/4 c  Water -- *see note
* This recipe is for an automatic breadmaker. Your breadmaker may
require a little less liquid. Start with only 1/8 cup water instead
of the 1/4 cup listed in the recipe. Check the dough ball while it is
kneading and add more liquid, one teaspoon at a time, if necessary.

Put ingredients into your breadmaker according to manufacturer's
directions. In a Zojirushi, the liquid ingredients should be put in
first, followed by the dry ingredients, with the yeast to be added
last. To make a softer crust, put the finished loaf of bread into a
plastic bag while still warm.
