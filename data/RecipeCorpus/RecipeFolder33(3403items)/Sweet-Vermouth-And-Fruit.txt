Title: Sweet Vermouth And Fruit
Categories: Desserts, Alcohol
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Heavy whipping cream
1/2 c  Sweet vermouth
1 ds Ground nutmeg
8 c  Mixed fruit -- * see note
* Use a variety of fruits. Some suggestions: melon balls, grapes
(both red and green), strawberries, sliced fresh peaches or
nectarines, bananas, raspberries.

Place the fruit in a large bowl; pour sweet vermouth over. Fold
carefully to cover all fruit with the vermouth. Let marinate, tightly
covered, in refrigerator for 2-4 hours. Just before serving, whip
heavy sweet cream until soft peaks form. Do not overbeat. Fold gently
into fruit. Spoon into decorative sherbet or dessert glasses.
Sprinkle very lightly with freshly ground nutmeg. Sprinkle with
toasted coconut if you like.
