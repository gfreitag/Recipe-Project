Title: Sour Cream And 7-Up Biscuits
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 18 servings
4 c  Biscuit mix
1 c  Sour cream
6 oz 7-UpÂ®
Mix the sour cream into the biscuit mix, using a pastry blender or two
table knives, until mixture is crumbly. Add 7-Up all at once, stir
quickly with a large fork. Turn out onto lightly floured board and
quickly knead 6-8 times. Don't overmix or biscuits will be tough. Pat
into a square and cut into about 18 equal pieces using a knife dipped
in flour. Can also use a  2 to 3 inch biscuit cutter. Preheat oven to
400 degrees and cook biscuits for about 7 minutes.
