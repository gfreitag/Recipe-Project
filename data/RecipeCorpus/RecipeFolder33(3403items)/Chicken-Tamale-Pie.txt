Yield: 6 servings

3    Skinless, bonelss chicken
-breast halves (about 1 lb)
-cut into 3/4" pieces
-(see note)
1 md Onion, chopped
2    Garlic cloves, minced

-diced
1 c  Stewed tomatoes
1/2 c  Chicken broth
1 tb Chili powder

Salt to taste
1/4 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
4 c  Warm water
1 1/2 c  Yellow cornmeal
2 tb Butter
1/2 c  Shredded Cheddar or
-Monterey Jack cheese
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken
pieces and saute, stirring frequently, until browned on all sides,
about 3 minutes. Add onion, garlic and peppers, and saute until
onions and peppers have softened. Stir in tomatoes, chicken broth,
spices, salt, cilantro and 1 tablespoon of cornmeal. Bring to a boil,
and stir until mixture thickens. Remove from heat and set aside.

In a large, heavy saucepan, combine water, remaining cornmeal and 1
teaspoon salt over medium high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring
constantly. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring frequently, until
mixture is thick and smooth, about 5 minutes. Add butter and half of
the cheese, stirring until melted.

Spread about a third of the cornmeal mixture in a greased 8x11"
oven-proof casserole or baking pan. Spread the chicken mixture over
the cornmeal. Top with the remaining cornmeal mixture, spreading the
cornmeal to the corners and edges of the baking dish to cover the
filling. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top of the cornmeal.

Bake at 375'F. for 25-30 minutes, until the casserole bubbles and the
top of the cornmeal is lightly browned. Serve immediately.

NOTE: Cooked chicken, boned and cut into bite-sized chunks, can be
substituted for the boneless chicken breasts. If using precooked
chicken, add the chicken just before you bring the tomtao mixture to
a boil. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-07-95
