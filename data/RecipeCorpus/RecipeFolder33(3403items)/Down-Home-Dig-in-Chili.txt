Melt lard in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add onions, bell
peppers, celery, and garlic and saute until onions are translucent,
about 10 minutes. Remove vegetables using slotted spoon and set
aside. Increase heat to high.  Add beef and pork; sprinkle with salt
and pepper. Cook until browned, stirring frequently, about 10
minutes. Return vegetables to pot. Add tomatoes, ale, chili powder,
chiles, cayenne and cumin. Reduce heat, cover *partially* and simmer
2 hours, adding reserved tomato liquid if chili appears dry.  Taste
and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Uncover and simmer until
thickened and meat is tender, about 2 more hours. Season chili with
hot pepper sauce if necessary.  Serve with green onions, cheddar
cheese, avocado, sour cream and chopped jalapenos on the side. Can be
prepared up to 3 days ahead; in fact, better if refrigerated
overnight before serving.  Freezes up to 1 month. For a great meal,
serve with margaritas and/or beer, corn bread, green salad or
coleslaw, and apple crisp for dessert.
