Title: Powter Strawberry Parfait
Categories: Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 c  Strawberries; very ripe
-fresh pureed, or 2 10oz
-pks frozen with juice
3 ts Plain gelatin
6 tb Sugar
4 tb Orange juice
1/2 c  Chilled evap skim milk
In a small saucepan combine strawberries, 4T sugar and 1t gelatin.
Cook and stir over low heat until sugar and gelatin are dissolved. Do
not let it come to a boil.  Pour into large mixing bowl and place in
freezer to chill.

Heat orange juice and 2t gelatin in saucepan until gelatin dissolves.
This can boil softly.  Then keep on very low heat while preparing the
next step.

In a small mixing bowl, beat skimmed milk on very high speed until it
becomes frothy (about 3 mins).  While mixing, pour the warm orange
juice mixture into the milk mixture.  The milk will start to thicken
and become creamier as the orange juice mixture cools.  When this is
accomplished, remove from mixer and set aside.

Take the strawberry mixture from the freezer and mix on high speed
until it becomes creamy (about 3 mins).

Fold the two mixtures together until well incorporated.

Pour the parfait into champagne glasses.  Chill for 30 mins and serve
plain or with fresh berries on top.  If you need to chill it longer,
take it out of the frig 30 mins before serving.
