3/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1. Heat oil in a deep-fat fryer or deep heavy skillet. Time heating
so it will be ready when you are prepared to begin frying doughnuts.
Use Canola oil if you prefer, but peanut oil has a higher smoking
point and is a good choice for frying. 2. In a large bowl, combine
flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cut in
margarine using a pastry blender or two knives. 3. Make a well in
center of mix and add mashed bananas and eggs. Mix well. You can do
this with a wooden spoon, or since dough will be very stiff you may
want to use your hands to mix it well. 4. Place dough on a lightly
floured surface and roll to 1/2-inch thick. Cut with a 2-1/2 inch
doughnut cutter that you dip in flour as needed. 5. Deep-fry, a few
at a time, until golden brown. Drain on brown paper bags. Fry the
doughnut "holes" also. 6. Combine sugar and cinnamon in a paper bag
or place on a shallow plate. Coat warm doughnuts with this mixture.

Yield: about 22 doughnuts and 22 centers.
