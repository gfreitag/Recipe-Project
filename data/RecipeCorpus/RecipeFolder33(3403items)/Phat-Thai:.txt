*Finely slivered fresh red and green I haven't tried this recipe yet,
but it comes from a pretty reliable cookbook called Practical Thai
Cooking. Boil noodles in lightly salted water for 7 min. or until al
dente. Drain. Heat oil in wok/frying pan over medium heat.  Add
garlic and stir-fry until color changes.  Add the pork and stir-fry
for 3-4 min. Add the noodles, stir well, and add all the Seasonings.
Stir-fry for 5-7 min., being careful not to break the noodles.
Transfer to serving dish and serve with the Condiments on the side.
