Mix together the vegetables & layer in a large bowl.  Sprinkle each
layer with salt. Pour in just enough water to cover.  Place a plate
on top to keep the vegetables submerged.  Cover & refrigerate for 8
hours or overnight.  Drain, rinse in several changes of water & drain
again.

Meanwhile, place 4 sprigs of basil in a small jar.  Add whole garlic
& just enough oil to cover.  Cover tightly & refrigerate for 8 hours
or overnight.

Prepare pickling brine by boiling the water, vinegar & sugar.  Bring
to a boil, stirring till the sugar is dissolved & then keep hot until
ready to use.

Sterilize 4 500mL canning jars.  In each one, place a basil sprig,
garlic clove & 1/2 ts mustard seeds.  Without forcing, pack the
vegetables into the jars leaving 3/4" headspace.  Pour pickling brine
into each jar up to 1/2" of the top.

Remove any air bubbles by sliding a rubber spatula around the edge of
the jar; wipe rims & fir lids.  Process in a boiling water bath for
20 minutes. Remove, cool, label & store.
