Preheat the oven to 350.  Grease 3 9-inch round cake pans.  Line
bottoms of the pans with wax paper: grease and flour the paper.
Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a
medium bowl.  Beat the butter in a mixer bowl till creamy.  Beat in
the brown sugar till light.  Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating
well after each addition.  Beat in the vanilla.  At low speed, add
the dry ingredients alternately with the sour cream, beginning and
ending with dry ingredients. Stir in the hot water: beat at low speed
just till blended.
Pour into the prepared pans.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until a
toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool in pans on
wire racks for 10 minutes.  Unmold and cool completely. Frost when
completely cooled.
