Title: Treacle and Marmalade Tart
Categories: Scot/irish, Pie/tart, Condiments
Yield: 8 servings
8 oz Short crust pastry
8 oz Golden syrup
4 oz Marmalade
8 oz White breadcrumbs
2 tb Lemon juice
Set oven to 350Ã¸F or Mark 4.  Roll out the pastry, and line an 8 inch
flan dish.  Trim the edges and reserve the extra pastry. Sprinkle the
breadcrumbs evenly over the pastry base. Warm the syrup and marmalade
very gently in a saucepan over a very low heat. Stir in the lemon
juice. Pour the mixture over the breadcrumbs. Roll and cut the
left-over pastry into thin strips and make a lattice pattern over the
tart. Cook for 25-30 minutes until golden brown. Serve hot or cold
with whipped cream. Serves 6.
