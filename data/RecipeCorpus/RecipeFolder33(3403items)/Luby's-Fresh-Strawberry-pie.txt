Categories: Desserts, Pie/tart, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
4 pt Strawberries, hulled
& washed
Strawberry pie glaze
(recipe follows)
4 c  Prepared whipped cream
(recipe follows)
2    9" cooked pie shells
Spread the inside (bottom and walls) of each cooked pie shell with a
heaping 1/4 cup of the glaze. Gently mix the strawberries with 2 cups
of the remaining glaze and divide equally into each of the cooked pie
shells.

Mold mixture into pie shell.  For each pie, pour 1 cup of the
remaining glaze over strawberries, filling in holes and gaps, making
a relatively smooth mound. (You will have about 1 cup of glaze left
over when finished. Reserve for another use).  Refrigerate and let
set for 2 hours. Top each pie with 2 cup prepared whipped cream.

Cut each pie into 6 equal slices and serve chilled.

Strawberry pie glaze: 3 cups water, 3 oz. package strawberry gelatin,
3 cups granulated sugar, 1 cup cornstarch dissolved in 1 cup water, 2
T red food color.

Place water, strawberry gelatin and sugar in heavy saucepan and bring
to boil, stirring occasionally.  Pour cornstarch/water mixture into
saucepan when mixture begins to boil.  Lower heat and whisk mixture
until thick and clear, about 5 minutes.  Add food coloring.  Remove
from stove and allow to cool.  Don't refrigerate.

Whipped Cream: 16 oz heavy cream, chilled, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1/2
teaspoon vanilla.

Place ice in a mixing bowl and let sit for 5 minutes.  Pour ice out of
mixing bowl and wipe with clean, dry towel to remove moisture.  Pour
cream into bowl and mix with electric mixer on high speed until
stiff. Add powdered sugar and vanilla to bowl and whip for about 15
seconds before adding to pie.
