Title: All about Fudges

Here are a few helpful
-hints on fudgemaking.
Always use a heavy pan.
Be sure sugar is dissolved before candy boils.  Thus always start
candy cooking over a low fire. Butter sides of pan to prevent candy
from overflowing.  This also helps eliminate candy from becoming
sugary. To prevent grainy candy, try adding a little vinegar to the
other ingredients. You will find it will become much creamier. For
smoother and creamier fudge, add a teaspoon of cornstarch to each cup
of sugar. To avoid burning candy drop three or four marbles into pan.
Boiling keeps marbles in constant motion; it does most of the
stirring for you. (This idea was garnered from an old-time candy
maker, and I  would not recommend it today. Many marbles are now made
of plastic or other materials that cannot withstand high
temperatures.) THE FUDGE DOCTOR Condition: Fudge doesn't get thick.
It is undercooked; therefore, return to heat and recook. Condition:
Fudge gets hard in pan.  It has been overcooked.  Add a few
tablespoons of milk and recook over low heat and stir until softened.
FUDGE VARIATIONS After fudge has been made and begins to thicken,
stir in one or more of the following:  chopped walnuts, pecans, or
peanuts, peanut butter, raisins or coconut. SOURCE: How to make Candy
