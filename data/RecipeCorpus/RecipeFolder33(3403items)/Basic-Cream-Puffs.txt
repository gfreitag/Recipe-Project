Title: Basic Cream Puffs
Categories: Pastry
Yield: 12 servings
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Margarine -- solid
1 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  All-purpose flour
4    Eggs
1. Heat water, butter, sugar and salt to a full rolling boil in large
saucepan. 2. Add flour all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden
spoon until mixture forms a thick, smooth ball that leaves the sides
of pan clean, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. 3. Add eggs, one at a
time, beating hard after each addition with wooden spoon or electric
hand mixer, until paste is shiny and smooth.

Shape and bake, following your recipe instructions, for making the
puffs and filling with a creamy filling of your choice.

* Most cream puff recipes instruct you to bake at 375 degrees until
puff is delicately browned and there are no beads of moisture
visible. Test for "doneness" by taking a puff out of the oven; if it
does not fall, it is done.
