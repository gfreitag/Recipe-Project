From The New York Cookbook by Molly O'Neill. "Leona Singer, who lives
in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, learned this recipe from her
mother and she swears by it.  'Every time I look at the recipe, I
think it's too easy to be true, but this dish is delicious, and
whenever I serve it, my friends ask me for the recipe.'" 2 packages
frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained 2 cups plain Pepperidge
Farm stuffing 1 onion, chopped 4 eggs, beaten 8 Tbsp (1 stick)
unsalted butter, melted 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
Preheat the oven to 375. Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl.
Form the mixture into bite-size balls and place on a baking sheet.
Bake until heated through, about 20 minutes.  Serve either as an
appetizer or side dish. (The spinach balls can be frozen on the
baking sheet. Defrost for 20 minutes before baking as above.) Makes
about 36, serves 6.
