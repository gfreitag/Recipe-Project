Categories: Bon appetit, Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 4 servings
8    Oranges
1 c  Dry white wine
3/4 c  Sugar
1    2-inch piece vanilla bean,
-split lengthwise
1 ts Grated orange peel
1 c  Fresh or frozen cranberries
Vanilla ice cream (opt.)
Cut peel and white pith from oranges. Working over bowl to catch
juices, cut between membranes of oranges to release segments; add
segments to juices. Combine wine, sugar, vanilla bean and orange peel
in heavy large saucepan. Stir over high heat until sugar dissolves
and mixture boils. Continue to boil until thickened to syrup
consistency, about 5 minutes. Add cranberries and simmer just until
berries burst, about 1 minute. Add orange segments and collected
juices and bring just to simmer. Transfer compote to bowl.
Refrigerate uncovered until well chilled, about 3 hours. (Can be
prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.) Discard vanilla
bean. Serve compote with ice cream if desired.
