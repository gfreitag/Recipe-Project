Third-place winner Kathy Smith, Sioux Falls.

Heat an electric fry pan to 350'F. Spray bottom and sides of fry pan
with non-stick spray or heat enough vegetable oil to completely cover
the bottom of the pan.

Thinly slice enough raw potatoes to cover the bottom of the pan. Add
onion, green pepper and salt and pepper to taste. Put cover on the
fry pan and let cook until potatoes are nearly done. Add one can of
Spam. Cut into small cubes.

When the Spam has been heated through, beat eggs and put them evenly
over the mixture. Put the cover back on the fry pan and let it cook
until the eggs are set.

Sprinkle shredded mild cheddar cheese over the top of the pizza. Put
the lid back on and let it cook until the potatoes are done
completely and the cheese is melted. Cut into serving pieces and
remove with a pancake turner. This recipe can also be made in a
skillet on the stove. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-08-95
