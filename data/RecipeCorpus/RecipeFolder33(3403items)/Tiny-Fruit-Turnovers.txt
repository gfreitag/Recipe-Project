Categories: Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 36 servings
3 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Margarine
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2 lg Eggs
1 tb Lemon peel -- grated
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
6 oz Dates -- pitted
1/2 c  Dried apricots -- 6 ounces
1/2 c  Apricot nectar
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Lemon juice
1 ts Lemon peel -- grated
1/2 c  Nuts -- chopped
1. Sift flour with baking powder and salt. Set aside. 2. In large
bowl, beat sugar, margarine, eggs, and lemon peel with electric mixer
set on low to medium. Beat until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in
flour mixture until well combined and smooth. Form a ball of the
dough and wrap tightly. Refrigerate a few hours or overnight. 3. Make
filling before continuing with cookie dough. In small saucepan
combine chopped, dried apricots, apricot nectar, sugar and 1/2 cup
water. Bring to a boil, turn to simmer, and cook, covered, for 15
minutes. Add chopped dates and cook 5 minutes longer, stirring often,
watching carefully to see that the fruit doesn't dry out and stick.
Mixture should be thick. Remove from heat and add the lemon peel,
juice and chopped nuts. Use your choice of nuts; walnuts or pecans
are good choices. Mix well and cool completely. 4. Divide dough into
4 parts and work with one part at a time, keeping rest refrigerated
until ready to use. On lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 10 x
12 inch rectangle. Use a sharp knife dipped in flour to cut dough
into 12 rectangles. Or use cookie cutter to cut dough into 12 pieces.
5. Use spatula to place cookies onto lightly greased cookie sheet.
Spread 1 teaspoon filling on half of each piece; fold over and use
floured fork to seal edges firmly. Prick tops in one or two places.
Bake in preheated 375-degree oven for 10-12 minutes until lightly
browned. Do not overcook. Continue with remaining dough, greasing
cookie sheet each time.

Yield: About 48 turnovers.
