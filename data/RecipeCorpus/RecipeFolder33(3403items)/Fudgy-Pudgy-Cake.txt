Categories: Desserts, Cake/cookie
Yield: 14 servings
2 1/2 c  Sifted cake flour
1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa
2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Baking powder
3/4 ts Salt
1 lb Brown sugar
3/4 c  Vegetable shortening
3 lg Eggs
1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Buttermilk
1 c  Hot water
Buttercream Filling
Chocolate-Sour Cream Frostig
Preheat the oven to 350.  Grease 3 9-inch round cake pans.  Line
bottoms with wax paper: grease and flour the paper.
Combine the flour, baking soda, cocoa, baking powder, and salt
in a medium bowl.  Place the shortening in a large mixing bowl.
Gradually beat in the brown sugar with an electric mixer till light
and fluffy.  Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each
addition.  Add the vanilla extract.  At low speed, beat in the dry
ingredients alternately with the buttermilk, beginning and ending
with the dry ingredients.  Beat until blended.  Stir in the hot
water: beat at low speed just till mixed.
Pour the batter into the prepared pans.  Bake for 20 to 25
minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cool in the pans on wire racks for 10 minutes.  Unmold and cool
completely.
To assemble the cake, spread Buttercream Filling between the
layers. Cover the cake and refrigerate 30 minutes or till the filling
is firm. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the frosting.
Store any leftover cake in the refrigerator.
