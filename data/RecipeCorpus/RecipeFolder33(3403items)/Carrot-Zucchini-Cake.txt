A pecan/cream cheese icing tops this double-vegetable cake from Maxine
Nelson of Elkhart, Indiana. Try the Elkhart County Fair baker's
masterpiece as a layer cake or in an oblong pan.

Pecan/Cream Cheese Icing (recipe follows)

1. Grease and flour a 13x9x2-inch baking pan or two 9x1 1/2-inch
round cake pans; set aside.

2. Stir together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, soda, salt and
nutmeg.

3. In a large mixing bowl, beat butter with an electric mixer on
medium speed for 30 seconds. Add sugar and vanilla; beat till well
combined.

4. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each.

5. Stir together the milk and lemon juice. Add dry ingredients and
milk mixture alternately to beaten mixture, beating on low speed
after each addition, just till combined.

6. Stir in the carrots and zucchini and fold in the nuts. Pour batter
into the prepared pan(s).

7. Bake in a 350-F oven 45 to 50 minutes (about 40 minutes for 9-inch
pans) or till a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
Place 13x9-inch cake in pan on a wire rack and cool thoroughly. Or
for round layers, cool in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Remove
cakes from pans; cool on wire racks.

8. Frost top of cake in 13x9-inch pan or frost and fill 9-inch layers
with Pecan/Cream Cheese Icing.
Pecan/Cream Cheese Icing: Combine two 3-ounce packages cream cheese,
softened, 2 teaspoons vanilla and 4 teaspoons milk. Beat till smooth
and fluffy. Gradually add 4 1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar to creamed
mixture; beat till smooth and fluffy. Stir in 1/2 cup finely chopped
pecans. If necessary, add additional milk to make frosting of
spreading consistency.
