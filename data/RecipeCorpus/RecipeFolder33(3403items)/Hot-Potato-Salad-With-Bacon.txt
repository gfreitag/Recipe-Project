and shake pan over low heat to dry potatoes. Peel and cut into about
1/4-inch pieces. 2. Place in a large bowl and toss with the 1 cup
chopped onions, chopped parsley, salt and black pepper. 3. Combine
2/3 cup vinegar, 1/3 cup water and 1-1/2 teaspoon sugar in a small
pan; heat to boiling. 4. Place the egg into a small bowl and beat
slightly with a wire whisk. Continue beating while slowly pouring in
the vinegar mixture. Slowly pour in the salad oil, whisking
constantly. 5. Immediately pour this mixture over the warm potatoes
and stir to coat evenly. Place the potatoes into a large skillet over
low heat until heated throughout. Cook the bacon until crisp; drain,
crumble and sprinkle over potatoes. Serve immediately.
