Whether blue or bleu, there are no tow ways about it - a bleu cheese
lover will love this bread.  This moderately-textured loaf makes
great croutons and wonderful toast points for parties.  Or serve it
warm with your favorite steak.
Success Hints
-------------

The sharper the bleu cheese, the stronger the flavor in the bread.
Danish bleu is suggested.

As with all cheese recipes (due to differences in liquid content),
loaf appearance will vary.

Use regular or rapid bake.
