Title: APPLE-HORSERADISH KETCHUP
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
3 lb Tart apples, peeled,
-quartered and cored
1/2 c  Water
1 1/2 c  White vinegar
1/3 c  Freshly grated horseradish
3/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt
3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
3/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
3 3/8 ts Dry mustard
1/4 ts Ground cloves
Combine the apples and water in a large, heavy saucepan. Cook the
apples, uncovered, over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until
the apples are soft and have dissolved into a lumpy sauce, about 30
minutes. (The amount of time will depend on the variety of apple
used.) Remove the pan from the heat and let the apple-sauce cool a
few minutes. Transfer the applesauce to the container of a food
processor. Process the sauce until smooth. Rinse out the saucepan and
return the applesauce to it. Add the vinegar, horseradish, sugar,
salt, cinnamon, pepper, mustard and cloves. Bring the ketchup mixture
to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat
to low and simmer the ketchup, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring
frequently. Remove the ketchup from the heat and let it cool to room
temperature. Store the Apple-horseradish ketchup, covered in the
refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Makes about 4 cups. San Francisco
Chronicle, date unknown.
