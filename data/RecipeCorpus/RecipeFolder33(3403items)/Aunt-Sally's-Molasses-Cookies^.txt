Categories: Cake/cookie, Oldies, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Shortening or lard
1 c  Molasses
2 ts Baking soda dissolved in
1/2 c  Hot coffee
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground cloves
3 c  To 4 flour
MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
1    Envelope unflavored gelatin
3/4 c  Water
3/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Powdered sugar
3/4 ts Baking powder
1 ts Vanilla
Cream shortening until fluffy. Add molasses; beat well. Add
soda/coffee, salt, nutmeg and cloves. Stir in enough flour to make a
dough suitable for rolling out. Cut into any shape. Bake on greased
cookie tins at 350 degrees for about 6 minutes. Watch them closely.
Cool and frost.

Frosting: In a small saucepan, soften gelatin in water. Add sugar,
bring to a boil and simmer 10 minutes. Take off fire, add powdered
sugar. Beat hard till foamy. Add baking powder and vanilla and beat
until very thick (this takes a long time). Frost cookies; let dry.

A note about Molasses Cookies: Molasses cookies are very common, but
they are not easy to make, the reason being that there is no rule you
can work by which will answer in all cases. All molasses does not
work alike. Some kinds will bear more water than others, and the
weather has to be taken into consideration. You can use more water in
cold weather than warm, at times 1/2 molasses, 1/2 water. Be very
careful and do not work more than necessary to mix.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
