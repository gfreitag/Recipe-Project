A north-woods touch, precooked Minnesota wild rice, flavors these pork
patties from Katie Koziolek, who lives near Freeborn, Minnesota (80
miles south of Minneapolis). For summer entertaining at her Oak Hill
Farm, Katie asks guests to bring salads and bar cookies. She supplies
the burgers and

Condiments: sliced sweet onion, cooked bacon slices, dill pickle
chips, sliced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, colby and Monterey Jack
cheese slices, mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard

1. In a mixing bowl, combine pork, pepper, salt and wild rice. Mix
well. Shape into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.

2. Grill meat on the rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium
coals 14 to 18 minutes or till no pink remains, turning once halfway
through cooking.

3. Serve on buns. Top with your choice of condiments.

Makes 4 servings.

Oak Hill Farm Burger: Prepare as above, except use a garlic-pepper
seasoning blend for the seasonings and omit wild rice. Serve on buns
with your choice of onion, bacon, pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese,
mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard. Makes 4 servings.
