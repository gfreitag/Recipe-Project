Preheat oven at 300.  Prepare baking pan with cooking spray.  Season
with salt, pepper, and thyme.  Dredge in flour on both sides.  Shake
off excess flour.  Heat a skillet with oil over medium heat for 2 to
3 minutes.  When oil is ready cook chicken breasts for 3 to 4 minutes
on each side.  Set aside in prepared baking pan. Bake for 10 minutes
with one of the following additions: ¥With Lemon: De glaze the same
skillet with 1/4 cup lemon juice. Add chicken and bake. Before
serving, garnish each portion with a wedge of lemon. ¥With Mushrooms:
Cook 2 tablespoons minced onions for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add 1 pound
sliced mushrooms. Cook until mushrooms are slightly browned. Pour on
1/4 cup chicken broth or yogurt. Reduce over high heat for 3 minutes.
Spread over chicken. ¥With Onions, Garlic, and Parsley: Cook 1/4 cup
onions and 2 tablespoons minced garlic over medium heat. Be careful
not to burn.  Spread on chicken and bake. Add 1/2 cup parsley just
before serving. ¥With Tomato and Herbs: Cook chicken in olive oil.
Add 1/2 cup diced onion and 1 tablespoon minced garlic to the hot
skillet. When onion looks glazed, add 1 diced red or green pepper and
1 cup stewed tomatoes. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon each marjoram, rosemary,
basil, thyme, and parsley. Add 1/4 cup chicken broth. Simmer for a
few minutes. Serve chicken on a bed of sauce. ¥With Spicy Sauce: Cook
1 tablespoon onion until glazed. Add 1 cup chicken broth, 2
tablespoons stewed tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon allspice, and 1/4 teaspoon
each cumin and red pepper flakes. Return chicken to skillet.
Cover and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes instead of baking.
