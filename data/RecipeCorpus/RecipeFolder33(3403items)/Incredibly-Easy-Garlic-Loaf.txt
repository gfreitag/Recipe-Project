Title: Incredibly Easy Garlic Loaf
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Bread dough
1/4 c  Margarine
1    Egg
Garlic salt -- * see note
Parsley -- ** see note
* Use about 1 tablespoon garlic salt, or make a combination of 1
teaspoon garlic salt and 1 very finely minced garlic clove. ** Use up
to 1 tablespoon parsley as you desire.

Thaw the bread dough only long enough to be able to slice it. Don't
thaw completely. Cut into 15 pieces. Melt solid margarine in small
pan; add parsley, garlic salt and about half of one beaten egg. Roll
each bread slice into a ball; dip in the margarine mixture. Arrange
in a SINGLE layer in a lightly greased 9 by 5-inch pan. Let rise in a
draft-free warm place for about 2-1/2 hours. Bake in a preheated
350-degree oven for about 25 minutes, or until top is golden brown.
Let cool slightly, remove from pan and serve immediately.
