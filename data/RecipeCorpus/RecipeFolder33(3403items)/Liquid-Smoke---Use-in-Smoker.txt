Categories: Bbq/grill
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM----------------FROM : RICHARD DOUVILLE, FRI---------------------
As the Liquid Smoke I use
-is very intense, it is
-used in relatively small
MMMMM------------------QUANTITIES.  FOR EXAMPLE-----------------------
A single teaspoon can be placed in the water pan/catch pan of an
outdoor smoker (along with all of the herbs, onions, water, etc., to
boost flavor and smokiness. A single teaspoon can be used to add an
unusual flavor to about a gallon of pre-mixed Bloody Marys. Outdoor
Smoker Pan Solution: 2 onions, halved 1 celery bottom (the root end
that is normally thrown out) 1 Tablespoon dried thyme 6 garlic
cloves, smashed 3 Tablespoons Angostura or Peychaud Bitters 1 to 2
teaspoons Liquid Smoke Water to cover Place all ingredients in the
water bowl of an outdoor smoker, before smoking your fowl, beef,
pork, etc. The aromatic liquid left in the pan may be strained off,
defatted somewhat, then used to make a very smokey gravy BASE for
your cooked foods.
