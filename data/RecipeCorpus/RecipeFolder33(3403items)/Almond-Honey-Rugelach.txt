Categories: Breakfast, Cake/cookie, Desserts
Yield: 32 servings
1 c  Butter or margarine
3 oz Cream cheese
1/2 c  Honey
2 c  Flour
1 ts Lemon juice
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1 c  Almonds
1/2 c  Dried cherries
Cream butter and cream cheese until fluffy.  Add 3 tablespoons honey
and mix well.  Mix in flour until dough holds together.  Form into a
ball, wrap and refrigerate 2 hours or longer.

Divide dough in 4; on a floured board roll each portion into a 9-inch
circle.  Combine 2 tablespoons honey and lemon juice; mix well.  Brush
dough with honey mixture; sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon over entire
surface.  Combine almonds and dried cherries; drizzle remaining honey
over mixture and mix well.  Spread 1/4 of almonds mixture onto circle
of dough, stopping 1/2-inch from outer edge.  Cut into 8 triangular
pieces.  Roll from wide outer edge toward tip.  Gently bend both ends
to form a crescent. Place on oiled parchment paper-lined baking sheet
and refrigerate 20 mins. or longer.  Repeat with remaining dough and
filling.  Bake at 350 degrees F 20 to 25 minutes or until golden
brown.  Cool on racks.

Freezing tip: For longer storage, package unfrozen crescents in
freezer-safe container or bags and freeze until ready to bake.
