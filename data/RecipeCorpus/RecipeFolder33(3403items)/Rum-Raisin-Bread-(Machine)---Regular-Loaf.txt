Rum raisin is another of those versatile breads that can stretch from
breakfast to dessert.  Sweeter and richer than our standard raisin
bread, Rum Raisin is subtle enough not to be overwhelming while rich
enough to stand out.  Serve it with Honey Butter spread for a real
treat.

Success Hints
-------------

Soak raisins in spicy rum overnight and drain before using.  Measure
raisins after they have soaked.

For additional rum flavor add 1/4 t rum extract.  For a non-alcoholic
version, pre-soak the raisins in water and use rum extract.

Use regular or rapid bake cycle.
