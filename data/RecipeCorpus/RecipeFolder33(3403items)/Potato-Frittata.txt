Title: Potato Frittata
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
2    Potatoes
2 tb Vegetable or olive oil
1    Red or green bell pepper
2    Garlic cloves, peeled and
-minced
Salt
Pepper
1 ts Thyme or oregano
5    Eggs
Peel potatoes and cut them in 1" squares. Add oil to a 10" skillet
and, when it's hot, add potatoes. Cook over medium heat, stirring
occasionally.

Meanwhile, core and slice bell pepper. Add it to the skillet and stir
them occasionally.

Peel and mince garlic. When the potatoes and peppers are nearly
tender, add garlic and cook until it is aromatic. This process, from
potatoes to garlic, will take about 20 minutes.

Beat the eggs. When the vegetables are soft, pour the eggs over the
top. Lift the edges of the eggs as they set around the sides of the
pan, and let uncooked eggs flow underneath. When eggs are gently set,
slice the frittata into 4-6 pieces and serve on a plate with salad
and a roll. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-07-95
