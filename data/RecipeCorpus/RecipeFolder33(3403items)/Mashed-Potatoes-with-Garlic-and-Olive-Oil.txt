From "Cold Weather Cooking" by Sarah Leah Chase.

Place potatoes and garlic in pot amply covered with water; bring to a
boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook for 35-45 minutes; drain; set aside
garlic; return potatoes to pot and cook over medium heat for 2-3
minutes to evaporate water. Place potatoes in large mixing bowl;
squeeze the garlic pulp from skins and add to potatoes; beat potatoes
with electric mixer until fluffy. Slowly beat in olive oil. Season.
Serve at once. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-09-95
