electric mixer beat 4 of the eggs with the sugar, vanilla and salt
until the mixture is thick and pale.  Stir in the chocolate mixture
until it is just combined and add the flour and the chocolate chops,
stirring until the batter is just combined. Spread the batter in the

Drop the mixture by heaping tbsp on the brownie mixture, pull the
back of a spoon through the peanut butter mixture to swirl the
mixtures and bake the brownies in the middle of the oven for 30 to 35
minutes. Let the brownies cool completely in the pan on a rack and
cut them into squares.
