1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Margarine
1 1/2 c  Sugar

extract and grated lemon peel until smooth. 3. Gradually add flour
mixture, beating until well combined. Form dough into a ball, wrap in
foil and refrigerate overnight. 4. Divide dough into 4 parts.
Refrigerate until ready to roll out. On floured surface roll dough,
one part at a time, 1/4-inch thick. Using a 2 to 3-inch cookie cutter
or glass, cut out cookies. Use a spatula to carefully pick up and
place cookies on a lightly greased cookie sheet 2 inches apart. 5.
Lightly brush cookies with lemon juice and sprinkle with additional
sugar. Use colored sugar for decorative look. 6. Bake in preheated
375-degree oven for 10-12 minutes until golden brown. Do not
overcook. Remove cookies to wire rack to cool completely. Complete
baking using one part cookie dough at a time, greasing the pan each
time.

Yield: about 5-6 dozen cookies.
