Categories: Cajun/creol, Meats
Yield: 8 servings
6 sl Bacon
Salt
Pepper
3 lb Lean boneless beef chuck, or
-rump, cut into 2" chunks
5 tb Butter
5 tb Flour
4 lg Onions, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 c  Beef stock
2 cn Beer (10 oz)
1 1/2 ts Sugar
1 tb Vinegar
1 lg Bay leaf
3 lg Cloves garlic
5    Parsley sprigs, finely
-chopped
1/8 ts Red pepper (cayenne)
In a heavy black iron Dutch oven fry bacon until crisp and set aside.
Pour off almost all the fat, leaving just enough to have a thin film
on the bottom. Salt and pepper meat lightly. Heat fat until smoking
hot, and brown meat, a few pieces at a time. If needed, add a little
more bacon fat. When all the meat is browned remove and add butter to
the pot. When the butter melts stir in flour until well blended and
light brown. Add onions and saute until soft and lightly browned.
(You may need a little more bacon fat.) Add beef stock, beer, red
pepper. Stir constantly over low heat until well blended and mixture
begins to boil. Add sugar, vinegar, bay leaf, and garlic. Simmer for
2 to 3 minutes; then taste the sauce to see if salt and pepper are
sufficient. Stir in parsley.Return meat to the pot. There should be
enough sauce to cover, but if you are a little short, add beer. Stir
gently; cover and place in the lower part of oven at a temperature to
keep it simmering for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The meat should be
fork-tender when ready. Serve with rice or noodles if you prefer.
