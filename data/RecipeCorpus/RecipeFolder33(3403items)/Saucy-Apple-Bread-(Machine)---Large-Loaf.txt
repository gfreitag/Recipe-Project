Did you ever hear the cooking tip about putting a slice of fresh
apple in your cake saver to keep your cake moist?  Well, the fresh
Granny Smith apple in this recipe works the same way in this tangy,
long-lasting bread. Even days later it retains a nice moistness that
makes it a favorite for those times when you need to bake ahead.

Success Hints
-------------

Core & dice unpeeled apple.

The Granny Smith apple adds a tartness to the bread.  For a sweeter
bread, try using a Rome or a McIntosh.

Use regular or rapid bake cycle.
