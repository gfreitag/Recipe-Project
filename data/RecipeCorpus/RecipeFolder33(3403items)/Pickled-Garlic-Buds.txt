Title: Pickled Garlic Buds
Categories: Snacks, Condiments, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
1/3 c  Rice vinegar
1/3 c  Soy sauce; reduced sodium
1/3 c  Honey
20 ea Garlic bud spears
6    To 8 inches tall
1 c  Water
These are quick refrigerator pickles that are tasty additions to just
about everything except dessert. Chop or slice thin the long way and
try them on sandwiches, in omelets and with most any grain or bean
dish.

Mix vinegar, soy sauce and honey together; set aside. Lay garlic buds
flat in a large skillet with a tight fitting lid. Add the water,
cover and bring to a boil; reduce heat to a low simmer and cook about
3 minutes or until stems are just tender. Reserve liquid for other
uses such as soup or sauce.

Using tongs, move garlic buds to a large, flat, refrigerator glass or
ceramic container with a cover. Pour vinegar mixture over garlic buds;
close container and refrigerate.

Pickled garlic spears will be ready to use after marinating at least
overnight. Pickles keep refrigerated about 3 weeks. The marinade can
be used again for another batch of garlic buds, or use it as a garlic
flavored base for barbecue sauce.
