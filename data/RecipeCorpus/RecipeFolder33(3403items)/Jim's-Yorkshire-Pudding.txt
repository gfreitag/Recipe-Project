Many Yorkshire pudding recipes in American cook books call for butter
and all milk/no water; that's a Pop-over or something not a real
Yorkshire Pud. This pudding needs no butter or fat in the batter as
there is plenty of beef fat in the pan for flavor.

The ingredients are so simple that the final product is a real
surprise to first time cooks 'cause it's SO GOOD!

It used to be the custom in England to cook the pudding in a tray
under the roast and catch all the drippings. You get a tastier result
from making small puddings in muffin trays in a hot oven after the
roast is out as they puff up more and brown nicely.

In olden days it was served before the roast which would be served
with gravy covered potatoes AND bread to stretch out the meat.
Today's diet conscious hosts would usually serve the puddings with
the roast instead of potatoes and bread.

N.B. The ingredients must be at room temp when mixed to maximize the
puffing effect.

Preheat the oven to 400 F

In a bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Make a well in the
centre and pour in the milk. Stir. In another bowl beat the eggs
until fluffy and then add the water. Beat this mixture into the
batter until large bubbles form. [Let stand up to an hour if you need
to finish the roast.]

Heat the muffin tins in the oven. Pour beef drippings or melted suet
into each muffin hole to a depth of 1/4". It should be hot enough to
sizzle but not smoke. Pour in the batter about 5/8" to 3/4" deep.
Bake at 400 F for about 20 minutes; reduce heat to 350 F and bake
another 10 to 15 minutes. Serve at once with the roast, gravy, and
hot mustard or horseradish.
