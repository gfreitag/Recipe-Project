This refreshing salad is one of those California inspirations that
seem to have been passed around from chef to chef, restaurant to
restaurant. We think it may have originated at Cafe Beaujolais in
Mendocino.  It is particularly good with a grilled main dish or an
Italian style entree. For us, curly parsley works best in this dish,
but others prefer the Italian flat leaf.  The most important thing is
that the parsely is FRESH.

Mix together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, pepper and salt.
Toss the parsley and tomatoes together.  Drizzle the dressing over
and toss to coat. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and serve immediately.
