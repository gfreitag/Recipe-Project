Title: Herb and Spice Butter
Categories: Herbs/spice, Dips/spread
Yield: 1 servings
8 tb Unsalted butter softened
2 tb Fresh rosemary, chopped
1 tb Fresh tarragon, chopped
1 tb Fresh chives, chopped
1 tb Curry powder
1.  Beat the softened butter until creamy.  Blend in remaining
ingredients. 2.  Place the butter on waxed paper and form it into a
roll or other shope with a flat-bladed knife.(A pastry bag can be
used to create more intricate shapes.) 3. Allow the butter to rest in
the refrigerator for at least two hours so the butter will completely
aabsorb the flavor of the herbs.

tips:  spread over lamb chops during grilling and serve with baked
potatoes, steamed vegetables and rolls.
