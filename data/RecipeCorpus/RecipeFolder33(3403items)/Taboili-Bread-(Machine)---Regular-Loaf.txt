This is a bread that's definitely different.  Inspired by the Middle
Eastern bulgar wheat dish, this medium-bodied loaf offers a unique
blending of tastes and textures.  It can't be beat for a meatloaf
sandwich, or try it with a Greek salad or slices of warm feta cheese.

Success Hints
-------------

For additional flavor, add 1/2 t of dried mint leaves.

Place apricots away from water.

Taboili mix can be found in the gourmet or health food section of your
grocery.

Use regular or rapid bake cycle.
