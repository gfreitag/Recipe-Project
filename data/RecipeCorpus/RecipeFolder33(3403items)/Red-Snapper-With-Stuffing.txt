Categories: Fish/seafoo, Healthy
Yield: 6 servings
4 lb Red snapper -- * see note
1 ts Salt
2    Celery stalks -- diced
1    Yellow onion -- diced
1/2 c  Bell peppers -- chopped

1/2 c  Sour cream

* A 3-4 pound red snapper with head and tail attached makes an
impressive presentation.

Peel the lemon, using the peel for zest, and chop the lemon into small
pieces, discarding seeds. 1. Wash fish under cold running water,
taking care to wash inside thoroughly. Dry completely. Sprinkle
inside with 1/2 teaspoon salt and set aside while preparing stuffing.
2. Melt margarine in skillet; add onions, celery and green peppers.
Saute until onions are limp and translucent. Add remaining 1/2
teaspoon salt and the remaining ingredients. Blend well. 3. Stuff the
fish cavity loosely; fasten with metal skewers and use string to tie
securely. Grease a baking dish or pan large enough so fish won't be
crowded. Place fish in pan and bake in preheated 350-degree oven for
35-40 minutes. Baste with vegetable oil every 7-8 minutes until fish
flakes easily. 4. Remove the skewers and allow to set for about 5
minutes. Serve immediately.
