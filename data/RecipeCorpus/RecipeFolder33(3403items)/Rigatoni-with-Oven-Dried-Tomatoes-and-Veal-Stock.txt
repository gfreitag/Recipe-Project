Pour in the veal stock and cook over high heat until the stock is

the white wine in a separate pan and set aside. Into the reduced veal
stock, stir the dried tomatoes, and the tomato paste. Reduce the heat
to low and cook for another 10 minutes. Stir in the cream, white
pepper, salt and black pepper. Adjust seasoning, if necessary.

over. Top with sauteed mushrooms and grated Parmesan cheese. Serves 6
as an entree.

may be substituted for veal stock.
