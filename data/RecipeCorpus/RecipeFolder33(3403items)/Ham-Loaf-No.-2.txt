Mix all ingredients well and shape into loaf. Place in pan large
enough to have at least 2 inch margins around loaf. Bake at 350
degrees for 1 hour, basting occasionally with Meat Glaze:

Heat all except pineapple to quick boil. Simmer 10 minutes, then add
pineapple. Spoon what is leftover from the basting to the cooked loaf.
Glaze is also good as a sauce for little meat balls served as an
appetizer. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-03-95
