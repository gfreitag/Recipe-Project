Title: 549350 Calf's Foot Jelly
Categories: Dips/spread
Yield: 1 servings
4    Calves' feet
3 qt Water
Whites of 2 eggs
1/2 lb Powdered sugar
2    Lemons
Clean the feet thoroughly and boil them slowly until the three quarts
of water are reduced to one.  Strain and set away until cold. Remove
the grease and place the jelly in a saucepan, being careful to avoid
the settlings.  Add the sugar, lemon juice and whites of eggs; let
all boil together for a few minutes.  Pour into bowls or glasses and
set away to cool.  This is much more nourishing than the commercial
gelatin. Submitted By BARRY WEINSTEIN   On   08-01-95
