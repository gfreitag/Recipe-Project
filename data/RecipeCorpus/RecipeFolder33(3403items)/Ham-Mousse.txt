Categories: Newspaper, Meats, Alcohol
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Unflavored gelatin
1 c  Vegetable or chicken stock
1 c  Whipping cream; whipped
1 1/4 c  Ham; diced
1 ts Prepared horseradish
1 ts Dijon-style mustard
1/2 ts White pepper

Soften the gelatin in the broth in a saucepan.  Place over medium
heat and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the
heat and let cool to room temperature.

Place the whipped cream in the refrigerator.  Pour 1/4-cup of the
gelatin mixture into a 4-cup chilled mold and place it in the freezer
until set, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, place the ham, horseradish, mustard, pepper, Madeira and
3/4-cup gelatin broth in a food processor and process until fine.
Scrape into a work bowl.  Fold in the whipped cream.

Pour the mixture into the prepared mold.  Chill at least 4 hours
before unmolding.  Garnish with quarters of hard-cooked eggs before
serving. Makes 10 buffet servings or 6 regular servings.
