chicken breasts and trim off any fat. Flatten them by pounding
lightly, then marinate in the wine and salt for 15 minutes.

minutes.

While the chicken is steaming, make the Sauce.  Place the coconut
milk in a saucepan and add the curry paste, fish soy, salt and sugar.

peppery. Warm 8 plates. Place a chicken breast on each and spoon 1/4
cup sauce around it. Serve warm with rice, noodles or mashed potatoes.
