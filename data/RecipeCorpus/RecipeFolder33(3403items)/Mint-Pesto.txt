Title: Mint Pesto
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Firmly packed mint leaves
1 tb Chopped nuts
1/4 ts Salt
1 sm Clove garlic, minced
Olive oil
3 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
Toss the fresh mint leaves into a food processor or blender along
with the salt, garlic and nuts.  (Pine nuts are good; walnuts are
okay also.)

Start the food processor and then slowly add olive oil.  Don't
process too long or add too much oil; aim for a consistency that can
be spread with a knife.  When done processing, remove it to a dish
and stir in the cheese.

This is great spread across the top of broiled salmon or halibut
fillets. You can also toss it with pasta as a simple side dish, or
add broiled or steamed slices of chicken, seafood, or vegetables to
make a main dish.
