Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Honey
2 tb Butter or margarine
1    Cinnamon stick
1    Orange peel
6    Flour tortilla
Vegetable oil
Combine honey, butter, cinnamon stick and orange peel.  Cook over low
heat at least 10 minutes.  Remove cinnamon stick and peel before
serving.  Cut each tortilla into six wedges.  Deep-fry tortillas,
smooth-side up, at 375 degrees F about 30 seconds.  Turn and deep-fry
30 seconds longer or until golden brown.  Tortillas should puff as
soon as they are put in hot oil. Remove from oil to paper towel-lined
tray.  Serve crisp tortilla with honey dip or spoon dip over chips.

Oven Method:  Brush both sides of whole tortillas with vegetable oil.
Cut into wedges before baking, if desired.  Place on baking sheet and
bake at 325 degrees F about 12 minutes or until crisp and browned but
not hard. Submitted By DAN KLEPACH   On   08-14-95
