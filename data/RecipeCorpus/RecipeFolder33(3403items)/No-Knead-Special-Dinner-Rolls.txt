Title: No-Knead Special Dinner Rolls
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 servings
2 pk Yeast -- not instant
1 c  Warm water
2 c  Hot water
3/4 c  Oil
1/4 c  Honey
2 ts Sea salt -- * see note
2    Eggs -- beaten
6 c  Whole-wheat flour --
Unsifted
* Use only sea salt if possible.

1. Dissolve yeast in the 1 cup warm water in large bowl. Allow to
stand for about 5 minutes. 2. Add the hot water, oil, honey, salt,
and beaten eggs. Mix well. Add flour gradually. Mixture will be
sticky, but do not knead. Cover and chill overnight (this is very
important). 3. Shape into rolls and place in greased pans. Bake in
