Recipe by: Lean Italian Cooking Preparation Time: 0:15

Preheat oven at 450. Prepare a 9 x 13 x 2" baking pan with cooking
spray.

In a mixing bowl, combine garlic, thyme, lemon peel, salt, pepper,
and bread crumbs.  Stir in egg white and mix well; set aside.  Wash
cod steaks in cold water and blot dry. Place steaks at least 2" apart
in prepared pan and brush them with lemon juice. Carefully spoon
bread crumb mixture over each steak, pressing lightly to adhere. (Try
not to get any bread crumb mixture in bottom of pan; it will as burn
as fish cooks.)  Bake until fish barely flakes, about 15 to 20
minutes.  Transfer steaks to platter, garnish with thyme, and serve.
