Title: Szechuan Peanut Sauce
Categories: Chinese, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
5 oz Chunky peanut butter
2 tb Low sodium soy sauce
1 1/2 tb Water
2 tb Sugar
6    Garlic cloves -- minced
1 tb Cilantro -- chopped
4 ts Hot chili oil
* Cilantro is usually sold in small bunches. You will need only about
1/3 of an average bunch or 2-3 of the stems with leaves attached. It
may also be sold as coriander or Chinese parsley.

Place all ingredients in food processor EXCEPT cilantro. Process only
long enough to thoroughly combine. Add finely chopped cilantro after
processing is done. If added to the mixture first it will take on an
unappealing color although it does not change the taste in any way.

Yield: 1 cup or enough for 14-16 servings. Use about 1 tablespoon of
sauce per serving of chicken or fish.
