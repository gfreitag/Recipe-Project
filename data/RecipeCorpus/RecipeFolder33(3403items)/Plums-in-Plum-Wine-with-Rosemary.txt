Title: Plums in Plum Wine with Rosemary
Categories: Can/preserv, Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 2 quarts
2 1/2 c  Fresh plums
2 1/2 c  Plum wine
1 1/2 c  ;Water
2 c  Sugar
6    3" sprigs fresh rosemary
Wash and dry the plums, then prick each one several times with a
toothpick or skewer.

Combine the plum wine, water, sugar and two rosemary sprigs in a
nonreactive pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently,
until the mixture boils and sugar is dissolved.  Remove the pan from
the heat, cover, and let steep for 30 minutes.

Prepare the jars, lids and boiling-water bath.  Remove the rosemary
and bring the liquid to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring
occasionally. Fill each hot, dry jar with plums and two rosemary
sprigs, leaving 1/2" headspace.  Pour the liquid over the fruit until
just covered. Wipe the rims with a clean towel and attach lids
securely. Place the jars in the boiling-water bath and, when water
returns to a boil, process for 25 minutes.  Remove the jars, cool,
label and store.

Oster writes: "Use small sweet plums for this dish.  The plum wine is
a Japanese sweet wine that is usually found in liquor stores near the
sake. The resinous quality of the rosemary keeps this dessert from
being cloying. To serve, warm the plums and spoon vanilla ice cream
over them."
