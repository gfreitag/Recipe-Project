Every joy which comes to you is a jewel which should be carefully
placed in the jewel casket of the mind. But the thefts, the
disappointments, the mistakes should be left with their own hour and
day. Yesterday belongs distinctly to the past. The failures which
belong to it are perished. It is wicked, inhuman to dig up the
remnants of each and rehash it today. Half the failures made by both
men and women are brought about by their dwelling on other past
failures. Half the misires of both heart and mind are repeated
because they are not left to the past. No man or woman could possibly
live properly today if they spend time in living over the yesterday.
Every well-balanced man and woman does each day that which he
believes to be right. When tomorrow comes let today enjoy the peace
of the past.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
