An egg cream is made with very cold seltzer or club soda, U-bet
chocolate syrup and ice cold milk. Start by putting about 1 to 1-1/2"
milk in a tall glass.

Add about the same amount of chocolate syrup.  Add the seltzer and mix
vigorously until the ingredients are combine.  If you've done it
correctly, there will be about 2" of white 'cream' at the top of the
glass.

An egg cream is never taken through a straw.  You should always drink
it from the glass!
