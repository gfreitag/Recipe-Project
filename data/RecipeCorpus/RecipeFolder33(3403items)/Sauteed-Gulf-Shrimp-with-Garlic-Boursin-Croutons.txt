Seafood seasoning:  Combine all spices and set aside.

Shrimp:  Heat the oil in a large skillet and add onions, garlic and
shrimp over medium heat until shrimp are half cooked.  Add seafood
seasoning, cream, lemon juice and Worcestershire and, over high heat,
reduce mixture by half.  Add scallions and whisk in butter in
tablespoon increments. Incorporate well and season with salt.

Croutons:  These croutons are the size of a slice of bread cut about
1/2 or 3/4" thick, resembling croutons that you would find in a bowl
of French onion soup, rather than ones you would find in a box of
store-bought croutons.

Toast the bread.  In a mixing bowl, thoroughly combine remaining
ingredients and spread on the toasted bread.  Warm slightly.

Divide the shrimp and sauce evenly among 4 soup bowls; garnish with
croutons.  Serve hot.
