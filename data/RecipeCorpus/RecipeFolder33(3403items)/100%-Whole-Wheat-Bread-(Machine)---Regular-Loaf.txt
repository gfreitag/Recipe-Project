The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra
knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a
lighter loaf.  When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset
the machine and start again - or use the whole wheat cycle, if it's
available on your machine.
Success Hints
-------------

If your market doesn't stock wheat gluten, try your local health food
store.

Remember the extra knead (as usual for wheat bread) - it's especially
important for 100% whole wheat bread!  You should use only the
regular bake cycle.
