In both England and Canada, fresh oysters on the half shell were
always the traditional way to start a Victorian Christmas feast.  If
fresh oysters aren't available, or you don't like them, this
refreshing seafood salad is a wonderful substitute.

Scrub mussels and cut off beards.  Discard any that remain open after
you have tapped them on the counter.  In saucepand, combine wine,
onion and lemon rind.  Bring to a simmer and add mussels.  Cook,
covered, for about 5 minutes, or until mussels are open.  Discard any
that don't open after boiling.  Remove mussels and allow to drain.
Add shrimp and salmon to same saucepan.  Cook at a simmer for about 4
minutes or until salmon just turns pink and is firm to touch. (Turn
both salmon and shrimp 1/2 way through cooking to ensure even
cooking. Remove with slotted spoon, allow to drain slightly.
Refrigerate until cold. Bring liquid to boil again and continue to
boil until reduced to about 1/3 cup. Strain and cool. To the cooled
liquid, add the mayonnaise, capers, mustard and parsley. Add enough
pepper for taste.  Stir in the chilled seafood, red onion and fennel.
Toss gently to coat well.  Refrigerate, covered, for about 3 hours or
up to 8 hours. To serve, line salad plates with lettuce leaves and
spoon seafood mixture on top.  Garnish with wedges of lemon.
