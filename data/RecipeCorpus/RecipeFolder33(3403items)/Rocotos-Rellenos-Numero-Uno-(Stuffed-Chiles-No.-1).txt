Wash the chiles, leave the stems intact, open half way, and
carefully remove the seeds.  Place the peppers in a large pot, cover
with water, and boil the chiles slowly for 3 minutes.  Drain the
chiles carefully, keeping them intact, and set aside.
Place the pork in a medium saucepan, add the 3 cups water, and
bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 1 hour, or
until the pork is tender.  Drain the mixture and reserve the cooking
liquid. Grind the pork using a coarse setting on the grinder and set
aside.
Heat the oil in a medium skillet and saute the onions and the
garlic. Add the ground pork, peanuts, peas, salt, and pepper, amnd
enough of the reserved pork stock to keep the mixture moist.  Mix in
the chopped eggs and remove from the heat and let the mixture cool
for a few minutes.
Stuff the chiles with this mixture and close as tightly as possible.
Beat the egg whitesw until they are quite stiff and then fold the
well beaten egg yolks into the whites.
Heat the oil, and when it is ready, dip each pepper into the egg
mixture and deep fry for 30 to 60 seconds, until the outside is
golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
