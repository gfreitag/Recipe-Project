2 1/2 lb Pork (80% lean)
1 1/2 ts Marjoram
2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Warm water
2 1/2 ts Powdered sage
1/2 ts Savory
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
Cut pork and fat into 1/4 inch cubes, using coarse blade of meat
grinder, grind meat. Place in Large bowl.  Mix Spices in the 1/4 cup
warm water and knead the mixture into the meat thoroughly. To make
breakfast sausage, add sage with a heavy hand for that country
kitchen taste. For a spicy sausage, add 1/8 tsp. cayenne. Form into
patties or rolls shaping the meat, stuff into natural casings to make
links. If freezing the sausage, do not add salt or sage or it will
cause an off flavor. Can freeze six months in freezer. Contributor

husband wanted a recipe that tasted like the sausage his grandmother
made.  M. Watkins.
