Title: Braised Beef German (Sauerbraten)
Categories: Meats, Aust/german
Yield: 8 servings
4 lb Top round or boneless chuck
1 1/4 c  Boiling water
1/4 ts Dried sage
1 1/4 ts Salt
1/3 ts Pepper
4 tb Butter or margarine
1/4 c  Maderia wine
1 1/2 tb Meat extract
2/3 c  Tarragon vinegar
2/3 ts Dried thyme
1 1/4 tb Dry mustard
4 tb Flour
1 cn (1/2 cup) tomato paste
Preparation time: 2 1/2 hours

Note: Save all used ingredients. Many are used again later.

Important note: Begin this dish three to four days before you plan to
serve it.

Add the 1 1/2 tablespoon meat extract to the 1 1/4 cup boiling water,
stir until well mixed, add 2/3 cup tarragon vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon
sage, 2/3 teaspoon thyme, 1 1/4 tablespoon dry mustard, 1 1/4
teaspoon salt, 1/3 teaspoon pepper. Stir to mix thoroughly.

Wipe the meat with a clean, damp cloth and place meat in a deep bowl.
Pour the hot liquid from the above step over it, cover, and keep in
the refrigerator 3 days. Turn the meat at least once a day.

After 3 days, drain the meat, and saute' it in the 4 tablespoons
melted butter in an iron or cast aluminum kettle 5 minutes, turning
on all sides. Remember, save the liquid.

Remove the meat from the kettle. Stir the 4 tablespoons flour into the
drippings left in the kettle from the last step. Add the liquid in
which the meat soaked for three days, (I told you to keep
everything), stir and simmer until thick and smooth.

Place the meat in this gravy, cover and simmer 2 1/2 hours. Turn it
several times in the kettle.

Remove the meat to a hot platter, add the 1/2 cup tomato paste and 1/4
Maderia wine to the gravy in the kettle. Stir, heat 1 or 2 minutes
and pour over the meat.

When you eat this, think of me. I just love this stuff. Green beans,
Au gratin potatoes, and a good bottle of NAPA Valley Cabernet
Sauvignan go well with this meal. Enjoy ...
