Select tiny white pickling onions.  Peel and place in a salt brine
made by dissolving 1 1/2-pounds of salt in 1-gallon of water. Use
enough brine to come 5 to 6 inches above onions. Allow onions to
stand in brine for five weeks.  If necessary, use a weight to hold
onions under brine.

Drain from salt solution.  Pour boiling water over onions, let set 2
hours. Drain and pack in sterilized jars.

Make a syrup of equal portions of sugar and vinegar and bring to
boil. Pour boiling hot over onions in jar. Cover jar but do not seal.

Drain off vinegar solution for 3 mornings, reheating it and pouring
over onions in jar.  With the third and last heating, add 1 teaspoon
pickling spices to each pint jar of onions, pour boiling solution
over them.

Fill jar to within 1/2-inch of top.  Put on cap, screw band firmly
tight. Process in Boiling Water Bath for 5 minutes.
