I have several recipe translations for ardei. This is as close as I
can get, and I know gram fried the rice in fat, then meat and
whatever veggies were on hand. Thickened with a roux and add tomatoes
and/ or sauce and simmered to desired consistency, slowly, about 40
min. Adjust seasonings.
This is literal- Wash and clean inside of peppers; mix ingredients in
order given, except tomatoes and water. Stuff peppers with meat
mixture, place in dutch oven or heavy pan with good cover and bake 40
min with tomatoes and water added. Let simmer until meat is well
cooked. Adjust heat down as it cooks, keeping right at simmer point.
If sauce is too thin thicken again with roux and serve with chilled
sour cream.
