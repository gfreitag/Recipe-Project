Title: Mr. Bill's Beerbelly Bread
Categories: Breads, Alcohol
Yield: 1 servings
5 c  All-purpose flour
3 ts Double-acting baking powder
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Sour cream -- 12 ounces
5 tb Sugar
12 oz Beer
1 tb Margarine
1/2 ts Mixed herbs -- optional
* If using self-rising flour, omit the baking powder and salt. Use a
combination of herbs and spices as you wish. Try some dried basil,
oregano, sage and rosemary.

1. Combine the sifted flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large
bowl; blend well. 2. Pour in the sour cream and beer and mix
thoroughly but do not beat mixture. Grease a 2-1/2 quart baking dish
or similar sized pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 3. Pour mixture
into pan and bake for 40-45 minutes. 4. Remove and brush top with 1
tablespoon margarine. Return to oven and bake 15 minutes longer, or
until browned and sounds "hollow" when tapped.
