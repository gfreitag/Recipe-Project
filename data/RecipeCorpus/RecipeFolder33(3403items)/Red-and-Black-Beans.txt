Recipe by: Stephanie da Silva Preparation Time: 0:15 Preheat oven at
350. In a large saucepan, combine the soaked beans and vegetable
stock. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 45
minutes or until the beans are tender.  Add the tomatoes, onion,
corn, green pepper, red pepper, garlic, cumin and chili flakes.
Simmer for 15 minutes. Season to taste with pepper and salt.  Steam
the corn tortillas (the microwave works fine for this) until soft
enough to roll without breaking. Using a slotted spoon, fill each
tortilla with a generous 1/2 cup of beans. Roll and place seam side
down, in a nonstick baking dish. Pour the beans and their sauce over
the stuffed tortillas and bake for 15 minutes, or until bubbling hot.
