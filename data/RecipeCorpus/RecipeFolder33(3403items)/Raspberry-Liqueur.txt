Title: Raspberry Liqueur
Categories: Mixed drink, Beverages
Yield: 1 servings
2 1/2 c  To 3 cups raspberries
-rinsed
2 c  Brandy  -- approximately
3/4 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Water
1 tb Lemon zest  -- grated
1/2 ts Glycerine; optional
-thickener
Lightly crush 2 cups of the berries with a fork; place in a quart-size
glass canning jar or any other that has an enamel-lined lid. Pour in
enough brandy to cover the berries. Addequal portions of the
remaining berries and brandy to reach the top of the jar's lip; make
sure that all the berries are covered by the brandy. Pour in just
enough brandy to begin a small overflow, then thightly cap the jar
and wipe the outside clean. Allow to steep in a cool, dark place for
2 months. Or, tape a piece of black construction paper around the
jar. Every 2 weeks, gently shake the jar to distribute the flavors.

After 2 months, gently pour the jar's contents through a regular
strainer or sieve; discard the residue. Follow this by 2 strainings
through slightly dampened cheesecloth or through a large clean coffee
filter placed inside a funnel; loosely cover the contents with
plastic wrap, since the process may take several hours.

In a small pan, combine the sugar, water, and lemon zest. Bring to a
boil over moderate-high heat. Simmer, uncovered for 5 minutes. Let
cool to room temperature. Add the optionalglycerine, if desired.

Funnel into a glass bottle, then funnel in the sugar syrup through a
strainer, to remove the zest.

Cover tightly; shake to blend. Let mature at room temperature, or
slightly cooler, for at least 1 month.  Can use vodka instead of
brandy. From "Glorious Liqueurs," Mary Morris.
