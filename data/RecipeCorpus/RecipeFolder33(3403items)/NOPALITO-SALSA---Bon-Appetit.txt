NOTE: This unusual salsa calls for canned or bottled nopaltos, the
stems of the prickly pear cactus. Available in the Mexican section of
many supermarkets, they're sometimes labeled natural tender cactus,
If you cannot find nopalitos at your local market, simply substitute
cooked green beans. Use this tasty salsa as you would any other-with
meats, chips and tacos.

Combine all ingredients in medium bowl. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, about 2 hours. (Can
be prepared 6 hours ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
