Title: Ham Stuffed Bell Peppers
Categories: Cajun/creol, Vegetables
Yield: 12 servings
3    Ham steaks, ground
12 md Sized bell peppers
1    Stick butter or margarine
5    Bell peppers, chopped fine
2    Cloves garlic
1/2 c  Cream
Salt
Red pepper
Black pepper
2    Chopped onions
6    Fresh tomatoes, chopped
7 sl Toasted bread, well crumbled
Onion tops, chopped fine
Parsley, chopped fine
Scoop out the 12 peppers and chop all insides and tops along with the
other 5 bell peppers. Parboil the 12 peppers. Drain and put into a
square baking dish to which a little cooking oil has been added to
prevent sticking. Meanwhile, saute ham in a little butter until
brown. Add all chopped seasonings and chopped bell pepper to ham
mixture, then add chopped tomatoes. Simmer on low heat about 1 hour.
Add the bread crumbs, enough to make it stiff enough to stuff. Add
melted butter, cream, parsley, onion tops and red and black pepper to
taste. If more liquid is needed, add more cream; toss all well and
fill the peppers. Cover the tops with crumbs and bake in a 350 degree
oven for 30 minutes. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-03-95
