always a challenge.  In bread machines, it becomes its own art form!
Experiment - it's the hallmark of a sourdough baker!

Success Hints
-------------

Follow preparation instructions for your chosen starter.  Starter may
take 24 hours to 4 days to activate.  Always feed your starter equal
parts flour and water (85 degrees).

Use regular bake cycle.

The more active the starter, the less you'll need.  Sourdough purists
may omit the yeast listed above.

Timing and temperature are the key elements of success.

Careful observation will reveal your starter's peaking schedule.
Starter should be peaking when loaded into the machine - frothy
and
bubbly, not just foamy.

Optimum room temperature for culture activation and machine
baking is
85 degrees.

If starter peaks at an inconvenient time, store it in the
refrigerator. Reactivate by feeding again and placing in an 85-95
degree place for 6-12 hours.

Save some of the active starter for your next batch.  Refrigerate in
an airtight container.
