Title: Hot Corned Beef Sandwich
Categories: Sandwich, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
2 md Idaho potatoes
2 tb Snipped fresh chives
2 tb Chopped flat-leaf parsley
Coarse salt to taste
Coarsely ground black pepper
-to taste
2 tb Vegetable oil for frying (or
-more if necessary)
1/4 lb Lean corned beef, sliced
1/4 c  Prepared coleslaw
When grating the potatoes, don't be concerned with the starchy liquid
that they give off. This will help bind them instead of using flour.
If you don't have or don't like coleslaw, spread a small amount of
mustard on the potato pancake instead, before adding the corned beef.

1. Coarsely grate the potatoes into a bowl, working quickly to prevent
discoloration. The potatoes should give off a starchy liquid. Add the
chives, parsley, salt and pepper; mix well.

2. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large, non-stick skillet over
medium-high heat until hot. Prepare 8 potato pancakes: Add 2
tablespoons of the potato mixture per pancake to the skillet,
flattening the pancakes with the back of a spatula. Cook until the
pancakes are golden brown, 2-3 minutes per side. Add extra oil to the
pan, if necessary, and fry the remaining pancakes.

3. Preheat oven on "low." Wrap the corned beef in aluminum foil and
warm through in the oven about 10 minutes.

4. Divide the corned beef evenly among 4 pancakes, topping each with 1
tablespoon coleslaw. Cover with the remaining 4 pancakes. Serve
immediately.
