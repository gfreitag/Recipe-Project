This oven cooked beef stew is slow cooked with soy sauce and wine to
allow the subtle flavors to come out. You'll love it.

Blend 2 tablespoons soy sauce with 2 tablespoons flour in 2 1/2 to 3
quart sauce pan. Add beef to this mixture, toss to coat meat.

Add the 4 medium chunked carrots, 2 large sliced onions, 1 cup thinly
sliced celery, 1 clove garlic, minced, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 1/4
teaspoon ground marjoram, 1/4 teaspoon ground thyme, and 1 cup dry
red wine to the meat. Stir gently. Cover tightly, bake at 325 for 1
hour.

Open pot, add 1 cup sliced mushrooms, stir gently, cover and bake 1
1/2 to 2 hours longer, or until meat and vegetables are tender.

Serve above on rice, potatoes, or noodles. A very dry red or white
wine would properly enhance this meal, and maybe you.
