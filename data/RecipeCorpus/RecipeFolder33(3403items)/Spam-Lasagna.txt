SPAM LASAGNA

1. Brown the ground beef in a skillet.  Drain off all the fat. Add the
garlic, salt & wine.  Simmer a few minutes.  Then stir in the crushed
peeled tomatos and tomato paste.

2. Put on low heat & cook, stirring occasionally for about 15
minutes.. Cook the lasagna. (look on box for specifics).

3. Combine eggs, Ricotta, Parmesan, parsley and pepper (dash or two)
and blend 'em up good. Key to this is SMOOTH.

4. Slice SPAM real thin, I like to use a cheese slicer.

5. In a greased glass baking pan (approx. 12 X 8 X 2 inches or
therebouts), arrange a layer of lasagna. Spread a layer of the
Ricotta mix on top of the lasagna.  Make a layer of SPAM slices on
top of the Ricotta mix. Top SPAM with a layer of meat sauce &
sprinkle with a couple handfuls of the Mozzarella. Repeat this
layering until you run out of stuff.

6. Bake this pie in a 350 degree oven for about a half an hour, until
bubbly & a nice brown crust has formed on top.  Let it stand a few
minutes after taking it out of the oven, it will be HOT. Should make
enough for about 6 hungry SPAM lovers!
