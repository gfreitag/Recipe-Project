Yield: 2 cups
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 1/2 tb Balsamic vinegar
2 lg Garlic cloves
-- thinly slivered
1 ts Black peppercorns, crushed
1/4 ts Dried thyme
6 1/2 oz Fresh shiitake mushrooms
-- stems trimmed
6 1/2 oz Fresh oyster mushrooms
1/4 c  Packed chopped arugula
3 1/2 oz Enoki mushrooms

In a non-reactive container, combine olive oil, vinegar, garlic,
peppercorns and thyme.  Let stand 4 hours or overnight.

Brush a little of the oil mixture all over shiitake and oyster
mushrooms. Grill shiitake and oyster mushrooms on barbecue (medium
heat) until tender, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes.  When
cool, chop coarsely. Combine chopped mushrooms, arugula, enoki
mushrooms, and red pepper in a bowl; pour remaining oil mixture over
and toss to combine. Add salt to taste. Serve with chunks of crusty
bread.
