Title: Easy Beer Bread
Categories: Breads, Alcohol
Yield: 1 loaf
2 c  Self-rising flour
3 tb Sugar
1 cn Beer (12 oz)
Spray a 9"x5"x3" loaf pan with non-stick spray. Mix flour, sugar, and
beer together to make a soft, sticky dough.  Pour dough into loaf pan
and bake at 350 F for 1 hour.  Allow to cool in pan and it usually
dumps out easily. This makes a quick & easy bread for those non-bread
bakers out there. I've tried it and it makes a fairly dense chewy
bread. Great with BBQs or accompaning a salad.  Good toasted too. The
kind of beer can make a big difference in the taste of the bread, so
experiment with some dark flavorful brews.

A couple of variations: Salsa Bread - add an extra 1/2 cup flour and
1/2 cup of your favorite salsa to the batter. Jalapeno Cheese - mince
up 2 or 3 jalapenos and grate 1/2 cup of chedder cheese. Mix into
batter and bake as above. Dill-chive bread - Add 1 Tbsp dry dillweed
and 1 Tbsp chives to the batter.
