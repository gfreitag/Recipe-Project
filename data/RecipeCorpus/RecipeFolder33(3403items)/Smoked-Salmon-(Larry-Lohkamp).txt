Categories: Fruit, Herbs/spice, Bbq/grill
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Pure salt
1/2 c  Honey
1 c  Soy sauce
2    Garlic cloves, crushed
1/2 sm Onion, crushed
1/2 c  Red wine (cheap)
1/2 ts Sweet basil
1/4 ts Red pepper
1    Salmon
This pickle is the product of 2 years of testing.  The only problem
with it is that you may not get to eat much of it.  I put 15 lbs of
Coho salmon in the smoker last week and only have 2 lbs left.  It's
amazing how many friends you have.

Put salt in a 1 qt jar.  Warm honey so it will flow.  Put honey and
soy sauce in a glass bowl and microwave on HIGH for 2 mins. Whisk
until honey is dissolved, then pour into the jar.  Shake well to
dissolve the salt. Add garlic, onion, wine, basil, and red pepper.
Add cold water to make 1 qt of pickle.

Fillet the salmon.  Scrape skin side with a knife under running water
to remove slime.  Work quickly so that water doesn't degrade the
meat.  Cut into chunks.

Place the salmon skin side up in a glass container; do not use metal
or plastic.  Cover with pickle and store in refrigerator. Pickle time
is 8 hours per inch minimum.  The pickle is balanced so that longer
times will not over-cure.

Remove salmon from pickle and rinse quickly in cold water.  Allow
salmon to drain and set up in refrigerator (skin side down) until
surface is shiny and tacky to touch.

Follow directions for your smoker.  For Little Chief model use 2 to 3
pans of apple chips and hold in the smoker for about 12 hrs. If you
freeze your smoked salmon, it will pick up water and soften when
thawed.  It can be put back in the smoker for several hours to
restore texture.
