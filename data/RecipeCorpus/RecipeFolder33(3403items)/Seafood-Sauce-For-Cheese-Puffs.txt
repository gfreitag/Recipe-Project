Title: Seafood Sauce For Cheese Puffs
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 6 servings
2 tb Celery -- diced
2 tb Grated onions
3 tb Margarine
3 tb Flour
1 1/2 c  Milk
10 oz Frozen peas
5 oz Crab meat -- canned
4 oz Cooked shrimp -- * see note
1 ts Lemon juice
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
1 tb Capers -- drained, rinsed
3/4 c  Cheddar cheese, shredded
* Shrimp must be pre-cooked before using.

Use a 10 ounce package of tiny mixed vegetables if preferred. Precook
and drain before using. Drain and rinse the canned crab, or use fresh
precooked. Melt the margarine in a skillet and saute the onions and
celery. Cook about 5 minutes or until vegetables are limp and onion
is translucent. Stir in the flour and blend well. Remove from heat
and stir in the milk gradually. Return to heat and cook, stirring
constantly, until mixture is thickened, about 2-3 minutes. Add peas,
crab, shrimp, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, salt and black
pepper. Heat thoroughly but do not boil. Remove from heat and add
cheese, stirring until melted. Return to heat if needed to melt
cheese completely but DO NOT boil. To serve, heat pastry puffs until
warm, fill with sauce mixture and sprinkle capers on top.
