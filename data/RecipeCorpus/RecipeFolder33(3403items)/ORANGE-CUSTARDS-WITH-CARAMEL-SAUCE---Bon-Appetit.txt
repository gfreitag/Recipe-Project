MMMMM--------------------------CUSTARDS-------------------------------
1 c  Milk (do not use low-fat or

1 c  Whipping cream

3 lg Eggs

2    Oranges
FOR SAUCE: Combine 1/2 C water and sugar in heavy medium saucepan
over high heat; stir until sugar dissolves. Boil without stirring
until syrup turns deep amber color, brushing down sides of pan with
wet pastry brush to keep sugar crystals from forming and swirling pan
occasionally. Remove from heat. Carefully add 1/2 C water (mixture
win splatter). Stir over low heat until smooth. Cool. (Can be made 3
days ahead; chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.)

FOR CUSTARDS: Preheat oven to 325'F. Bring milk, cream and orange
peel just to simmer in heavy medium saucepan. Whisk sugar, eggs and
yolks in medium bowl until thick. Gradually whisk hot milk mixture
into egg mixture. Stir in Grand Marnier. Divide mix ture among six
3/4-cup ramekins. Place ramekins in baking pan. Pour enough hot water
into pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake until custards
are set, about 30 minutes. Transfer ramekins to rack, cool. Chill at
least 3 and up to 24 hours. Cut peel and white pith from oranges. Cut
between membranes, releasing segments. (Can be made 3 hours ahead.
Cover, chill.) Place oranges atop custards. Spoon sauce over.
