about 15 minutes. Drain, and return to the pot.
Add the stock, onion, mushrooms, and ham to the kale.  Cook slowly,
stirring frequently , for 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, and
cook until the liquid has reduced and thickened and the stew is well
flavored, 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Serve sprinkled with the fresh herbs.
