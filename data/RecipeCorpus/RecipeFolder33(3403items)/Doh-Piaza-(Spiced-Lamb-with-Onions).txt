Title: Doh Piaza (Spiced Lamb with Onions)
Categories: Indian, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
1 1/2 kg Shoulder of lamb or mutton
1 kg Onions
6    Cloves garlic
1 1/2 ts Finely grated fresh ginger
3 tb Yoghurt
2 ts Chilli powder
1 ts Paprika
3 tb Chopped fresh coriander
Leaves
2 tb Ground coriander
2 ts Black cummin seeds
3 tb Ghee
3 tb Oil
8    Cardamon pods
1 ts Garam masala
Cut meat into large cubes.  Slice half the onions finely and chop the
rest. Put the chopped onions into container of electric blender with
garlic, ginger, yoghurt, chilli powder, paprika, coriander leaves,
ground coriander and black cummin seeds.  Blend until smooth.

Heat ghee and oil in a large heavy pan and fry the sliced onions,
stirring frequently, until evenly browned.  Remove from pan.  Add
cubed meat to pan, not too many pieces at one time, and fry on high
heat until browned on all sides.  Remove each batch as it is browned
and add more.  When all the meat has been done and removed from pan,
add a little more ghee or oil if necessary and fry the blended
mixture over medium heat, stirring all the time, until it is cooked
and gives out an aromatic smell.  Oil should start to appear around
the edges of mixture.  Return meat to pan, add cardamon pods, stir
well, cover and cook on low heat until meat is almost tender. Sir
occasionally.  It might be necessary to add a little water, but
usually the juices given out by the meat are sufficient.  When meat
is tender and liquid almost absorbed add garam masala and reserved
fried onions, replace lid af pan and leave on very low heat for a
further 15 minutes.

Serve with rice or Indian bread.
