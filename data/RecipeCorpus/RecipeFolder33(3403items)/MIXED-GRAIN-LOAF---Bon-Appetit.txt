Categories: Bon appetit, Breads
Yield: 1 loaf
1 1/2 c  Nonfat milk
1/4 c  Pure maple syrup, honey or
-molasses
1    Envelope dry yeast
3    To 3 1/2 C all purpose flour
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/2 c  Old-fashioned oats
2 tb Unprocessed bran
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Hulled unsalted sunflower
-seeds, toasted
-(about 1 1/2 oz)
Stir milk and syrup in heavy small saucepan over low heat until
thermometer registers 105'F to 115'F. Remove from heat. Sprinkle
yeast over; let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine 2 1/2 C all purpose flour, whole wheat flour,
oats, bran and salt in large bowl of electric mixer fitted with dough
hook. Add milk mixture; mix on low speed until soft dough forms,
about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 C more all purpose flour; beat at medium
speed until soft and pliable, about 10 minutes. Turn out dough onto
floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, adding more all
purpose flour if too sticky, about 3 minutes. Place dough in lightly
oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then towel.
Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about
1 hour.

Lightly oil 9x5-inch loaf pan. Punch down dough; let rest 10 minutes.
Turn out dough onto floured surface. Roll out dough to 10-inch
diameter round. Sprinkle with sunflower seeds. Fold dough over seeds;
knead until seeds are incorporated. Shape into oval loaf, place seam
side down in prepared pan. Cover with plastic. Let dough rise in warm
draft-free area until doubled, about 35 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350'F. Remove plastic from bread. Bake
until bread is golden and sounds hollow when tapped on bottom, about
45 minutes. Cool in pan 5 minutes. Turn out loaf onto rack; cool
completely. (Can be made 2 weeks ahead. Wrap tightly antifreeze.)
