2 lb Fish fillets, preferably
-oily fish such as
-swordfish, tuna or shark
1/2    Juice of lemon
Salt
Pepper
California Charmoula
4    Artichokes
4    Russet potatoes, sliced
Rub fish fillets on all sides with lemon juice and salt and pepper to
taste. Pour California charmoula mixture in large steel work bowl.
Dip fish fillets in charmoula, shake off excess. Set aside on plate
to marinate at least 45 minutes.

Trim artichokes by pulling off any leaves clinging to stem and 2
outer rows of leaves around base. Holding artichoke in 1 hand and
sharp paring knife in other, turn artichoke, trimming away outer
leaves. When outer leaves have been trimmed where yellow bases show,
lay artichoke on side and cut away top, roughly at where leaves swell
out. Set artichoke upside down on flat cap, and divide in quarters
lengthwise. Trim away hairy chokes.

Toss cleaned artichokes and potatoes in work bowl with remaining
charmoula and stir well to coat.

Remove artichokes and potatoes, reserving leftover charmoula in work
bowl, and scatter over bottom of baking dish. Lay fish pieces on top
of vegetables and seal dish tightly with foil. Bake at 400'F. 30
minutes. Remove foil, pour remaining charmoula over all, and return
to oven 20 minutes, or until vegetables begin to turn crusty and
brown.
