Categories: Salads, Chinese
Yield: 6 servings
1 lb Pork tenderloin
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
2 tb Brown sugar
1 1/2 tb Soy sauce, low sodium
2 tb Sherry
1 tb Hoisin sauce
MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
2 tb Oil -- *see note

MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
6 oz Vermicelli
1 c  Carrots -- julienned
1 c  Pea pods
4    Green onions
1 tb Sesame seeds
* Use olive oil or a mixture of olive and peanut oil.

1. Cut the pork into very thin slices, suitable for stir-frying. Mix
brown sugar, 1-1/2 teaspoons soy sauce, sherry (optional) and Hoisin
sauce. Pour over the pork strips in heavy plastic bag. Tie bag and
put mixture into refrigerator to marinate up to 1 hour, turning bag
occasionally.

2. To prepare the dressing, combine oil, sugar, 2 tablespoons soy
sauce, ginger root and Tabasco or other hot sauce. Blend and put into
refrigerator to chill.

3. Cook vermicelli to desired doneness. Add the pea pods and carrots
during last 2 minutes of cooking. Drain and immediately rinse with
cold water. Put into large bowl. Pour the dressing over vermicelli
mixture, add the green onions (slice into thin rounds, tops
included). Set aside while preparing pork.

4. Remove the pork from refrigerator and put into a wok or large heavy
skillet. Include some of the marinade. Stir pork strips until browned
and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Drain and add to the salad
mixture. Mix the salad well. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour to allow
the flavors to blend. If desired, sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds
just before serving.

NOTES : Steamed broccoli flowerettes go well in this salad, and
chopped waterchestnuts will add some crunch.
