Title: Multi Layered Salad For A Crowd
Categories: Salads
Yield: 300 servings
12    Heads lettuce
12 c  Sliced celery
48    Hard boiled eggs, sliced
6 lb Frozen peas
7    Green peppers, chopped
5    5oz cans water chestnuts,
Sliced thin
6 sm Jars mayonnaise
6    16oz containers of sour
Cream
8 tb Sugar
4 lb Grated cheddar cheese
27    28 oz bacon bits for garnish
(or real bacon, crumbled)
Wash, drain and tear lettuce into small pieces.  In large pans or
bowls, arrange lettuce on bottom, then layer the next ingredients as
given. Mix the mayonnaise, sour cream and sugar together and spread
over salad to cover top layer.  Seal to edges.  Sprinkle grated
cheese over top and then bacon bits on top of cheese.  Seal tightly
with plastic wrap or airtight lid.  Allow to sit overnight in fridge.
MUST be allowed to sit overnight... much better flavour when made the
day before.
