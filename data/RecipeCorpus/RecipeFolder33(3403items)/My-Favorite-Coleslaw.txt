Title: My Favorite Coleslaw
Categories: Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1    Cabbage head
1    Onion -- minced
2 tb Salad vinegar
1/4 c  Sour cream
1/4 c  Mayonnaise -- * see note
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
Paprika -- optional
Green bell peppers, slivered
Optional
Red bell peppers, slivered
Optional
1/2 ts Dry mustard -- optional
1/4 ts Celery seed -- optional
* Use only real mayonnaise, not salad dressing. This coleslaw must be
allowed to blend flavors in refrigerator for 2 hours or more
(overnight is best) for best taste.

Shred cabbage in VERY thin strands. Sprinkle evenly with vinegar,
minced onion, fresh ground black pepper and sugar. Put into airtight
bowl or plastic bag and refrigerator for 1 hour or more. Mix sour
cream, mayonnaise, dry mustard (if desired) and salt. If using green
and red sweet peppers, sliver them before adding to sour cream
mixture. Add celery seeds at this time also if you are using them.
Add this mixture to chilled cabbage and shake in plastic bags or stir
gently to mix thoroughly. Place back in refrigerator for 2 hours or
more.
