Title: Grilled Steaks and Tomatoes with Basil-Garlic Bread
Categories: Bbq/grill, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
2    T-bone steak
3 tb Olive oil
1 ts Dried basil
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1    French bread
6    Tomato slice
2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
Combine oil, basil and garlic powder; reserve.  Place beef steaks on
grid over medium coals.  Grill steaks 10 to 14 minutes for rare (140
degrees) to medium (160 degrees), turning once. Season with salt and
pepper, if desired. Meanwhile cut bread in half lengthwise; brush
with 1 1/2 tablespoons basil mixture evenly on cut side of bread.
Brush remaining basil mixture on one side of each tomato slice. About
five minutes before steaks are done, place bread, cut-side down, and
tomatoes on grid with steaks; grill 2 to 3 mins. Turn bread and
tomatoes over; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Continue grilling 1 to
3 minutes or until bread is golden brown and tomatoes are just heated
through. Cut bread diagonally into slices. Carve steaks into thick
slices. Serve with bread and tomato slices. Submitted By DAN KLEPACH
