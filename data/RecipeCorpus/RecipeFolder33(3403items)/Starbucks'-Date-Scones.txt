Title: Starbucks' Date Scones
Categories: Breads
Yield: 12 scones
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 c  Bran
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Salt
2 ts Cinnamon
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Unsalted, chilled butter
1    Egg
2/3 c  Buttermilk
2/3 c  Chopped dates
1. Combine the all-purpose and whole wheat flours, the bran, baking
powder, soda, salt, cinnamon, and brown sugar.

2. Cut in the butter.  (Or combine in a food processor, just until
crumbly.)

3. Add the egg, buttermilk and dates; do not overmix.  (If the dough
seems too sticky to work with add a couple more tablespoons flour.)

4. Shape the dough into a rectangle about 1-inch thick on a floured
surface.  Cut into 12 triangles.  Bake on an ungreased baking sheet
in a preheated 350-degree oven about 25 minutes.  Cool on a rack.
