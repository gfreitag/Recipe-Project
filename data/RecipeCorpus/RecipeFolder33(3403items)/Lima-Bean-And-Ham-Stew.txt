Title: Lima Bean And Ham Stew
Categories: Meats, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
3    Ham hocks
1 lb Lima beans
3 c  Chicken broth
3 c  Water
2    Garlic cloves
2    Bermuda onions
1 c  Celery -- diced
1 c  Carrots -- sliced
1    Bay leaves
Hot pepper sauce --
Optional
1. Prepare lima beans by picking over to remove any debris that might
be in package. Rinse beans well. Cover with about 8 cups water. Bring
to a boil, cover and boil 2 minutes. Remove from heat, keep covered
and allow to stand for 1 hour or more. 2. While beans are soaking,
prepare the ham hocks (or use meaty ham bones). Combine the 3 cups
broth and 3 cups water in a large heavy pan with lid; bring to a
boil. Add the ham and simmer for about 1 hour. 3. Drain the beans,
running hot water over beans briefly to rinse. Add the beans to the
ham mixture. Slice the onions and separate into rings. Add the
onions, along with the carrots, celery, and bay leaf, to the pot.
Mince the garlic cloves or use a garlic press; add to mixture. Add
fresh ground black pepper and salt if you prefer. Ham is salted
already so you may not want to add salt at this point. Pour
additional broth or hot water over this mixture to reach about 1 inch
above the ingredients. 4. Simmer for about 1 hour, stirring several
times, checking to see if you need to add more liquid. After beans
and vegetables are tender, remove the ham hocks or bone. Remove the
meat from bones and add back to the bean mixture. Taste and add more
salt or pepper if you wish; also add hot pepper sauce to your taste.
