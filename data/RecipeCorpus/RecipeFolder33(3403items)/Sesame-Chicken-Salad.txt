1 tb Sesame seeds
3    Whole chicken breasts
6 c  Water
2 tb Soy sauce

This is a bit more substantial than what one usually thinks of when
dealing with Chinese Chicken Salad. The chicken breasts are cooked in
the Chinese manner by boiling and then steeping off the heat. This
gives chicken that is cooked but extremely juicy and tender.

1. Sprinkle sesame seeds into small, shallow baking pan or cookie
sheet with sides. Bake in preheated 350 degrees F (180 C) oven until
golden, 5 to 8 minutes.

2. Combine chicken, water, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of the soy sauce, the
salt and fivespice powder in 3 or 4-quart (3 or 4 L) sauce- pan.
Cover and cook over high heat until water boils. Reduce heat and
simmer 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Let chicken stand in water
1 hour.

3. Remove chicken from water (reserve water) and drain. Remove and
discard chicken bones. Cut meat into 1/2-inch (1.5 cm) wide slices.

4. Cut celery into diagonal slices. Heat reserved water over high heat
until it boils. Add celery and cook until crisp-tender, 1 to 2
minutes. Drain celery well.

5. Combine remaining 1 tablespoon (15 mL) soy sauce with oils, ginger
and pepper in large bowl. Add chicken and celery. Toss until
completely combined. Transfer mixture to serving dish. Sprinkle with
sesame seeds.
