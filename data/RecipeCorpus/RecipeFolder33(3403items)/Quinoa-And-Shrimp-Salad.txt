QUINOA AND SHRIMP SALAD

Quinoa (pronounced kween wa) is an ancient South American garin
that's a complete protein, healthful and delicious. You can use rice
or couscous in its place. Serve this as an appetizer or light main
course.

Rinse quinoa well in strainer. Bring large pot of water to boil; add
salt and quinoa; cook about 12 minutes, until just tender. Drain in
strainer, rinse with cold water and gently squeeze dry. Place in
bowl; add shrimp, fresh coriander and chives.

For the dressing, whisk together jalapeno, garlic, salt, pepper, lime
juice, honey, soy sauce and olive oil. Toss gently with quinoa. Adjust
seasoning to taste.

Makes 4 servings.
