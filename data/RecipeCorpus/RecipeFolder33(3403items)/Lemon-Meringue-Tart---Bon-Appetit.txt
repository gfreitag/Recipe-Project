FOR CURD: Combine lemon juice, sugar, cream and yolks in heavy small
sauce- pan and whisk to combine. Cook over medium-low heat until
mixture thickens and just begins to bubble, stirring constantly,
about 7 minutes. Immediately transfer to bowl. Press plastic wrap
onto surface to prevent skin from forming. Chill until cold, at least
2 hours.

FOR CRUST: Combine flour, 2 T sugar and salt in processor. Add chilled
unsalted butter and process using on/off turns until mixture resembles
coarse meal. Gradually add 3 T water and blend using on/off turns
until mixture forms moist clumps. If dough is too dry, add more water
by teaspoonfuls. Gather dough into ball. Flatten into 8-inch disk.
Wrap in plastic; chill 1 hour. (Curd and dough can be pre- pared up
to 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated. Let dough soften briefly at room
temperature before rolling.)

Preheat oven to 450'F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to
12- inch round. Transfer to large baking sheet. Sprinkle dough with 2
T sugar. Place lemon pieces on dough, leaving 1 1/2-inch border.
Sprinkle 2 T sugar over lemon pieces. Fold dough border in over lemon
pieces; press edges lightly to seal. Bake until crust is golden,
piercing through lemon pieces with toothpick if crust bubbles, about
25 minutes. Cool tart completely. (Can be made 4 hours ahead.)

FOR MERINGUE: Preheat oven to 450'F. Using electric mixer, beat egg
whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Add sugar and beat until
mixture is stiff but not dry.

Spread lemon curd over lemon pieces in crust, covering completely.
Spread meringue over, covering curd completely and sealing to crust
edges. Bake until meringue is golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer tart
to platter.
