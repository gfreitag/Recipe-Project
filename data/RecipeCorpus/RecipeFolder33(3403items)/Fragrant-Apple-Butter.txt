Title: Fragrant Apple Butter
Categories: Dips/spread, Healthy
Yield: 1 servings
3 lb Apples -- quartered
2 c  Apple cider
3 c  Sugar
2 ts Ground cinnamon

1. Peel, core and quarter apples. Place into a large pot along with 2
cups apple cider. Simmer uncovered until apples are very soft. This
should take about 1 hour. Add more cider if apples become too dry. 2.
Fit steel blade into a food processor work bowl. Place 3 cups of the
apples in the bowl and process until they are pureed, about 30
seconds. Remove from bowl and repeat until all apples are pureed. 3.
Return puree to pot and sweeten to taste. You may not want to use the
full 3 cups of sugar. Substitute part brown sugar if you wish. Stir
in cinnamon. Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Apple butter should
be thick and dark brown. 4. Pour into sterilized jars. Cover tightly
and store in refrigerator up to 1 month.
