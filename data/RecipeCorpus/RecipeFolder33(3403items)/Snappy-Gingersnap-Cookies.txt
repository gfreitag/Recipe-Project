Philip Maschka, who summers at Iowa's West Lake Okoboji, bakes these
spicy molasses classics for the Clay County Fair. His wife, Ruthann,
provides the recipe. She's shipped the cookies to their children all
over the U.S.

1. In a mixing bowl, beat the shortening with electric mixer for 30
seconds.

2. Add the brown sugar, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, salt and
cloves; beat till combined.

3. Beat in the molasses and egg.

4. Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer. Stir in any
remaining flour with a wooden spoon.

5. Cover and chill the dough for 2 hours or till it's easy to handle.

6. Shape dough into 1-inch balls and roll in more granulated sugar.
Place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.

7. Bake in a 375-F oven for 8 to 9 minutes or till balls set and tops
are cracked. (Don't bake on lower oven rack and don't overbake.) Cool
cookies on waxed paper or a wire rack (cookies will be softer if
cooled on waxed paper). Philip recommends sampling some while they're
warm.

Makes about 60 cookies.
