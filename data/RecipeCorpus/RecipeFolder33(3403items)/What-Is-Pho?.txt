WHAT IS PHO?

Pho, also known as Hanoi Beef Soup, is a popular Vietnamese soup. In
America, Pho is eaten as either lunch, dinner, or just an afternoon
snack. Traditionally though, in Vietnam, Pho is eaten for breakfast.

WHAT SHOULD I GET IN MY PHO?

When ordering Pho, you will usually have a variety of types to choose
from. Pho can be gotten with meatballs, ground beef, bible tripe,
beef tripe, soft tendon, brisket, and a variety of other tasty
things. And if none of those sound appealing to you, you can always
get your Pho plain. Well, not exactly plain, you don't eat your Pho
just like that. It is customary to add Mint leaves, bean
sprouts,lemon and lime juice, plum sauce and jalepeno sauce to your
bowl of Pho as well. Therefore, everyone's Pho is unique to
themselves and their individual taste. For hundreds of years now,
Vietnamese families have been having Pho for dinner. Now, we are
fortunate enough to have a multitude of Pho restaurants so we too can
enjoy Pho. Below, you can see a Vietnamese family travelling miles to
the marketplace most likely to buy ingredients for Pho.

DOES PHO HAVE NAY NUTRITIONAL VALUE?

Pho actually has a lot of nutritional value. It is made from only all
natural, home grown ingredients. In ancient times, Pho was given to
the sick in order to remedy them. It is believed that Pho has many
beneficial values and is therefore eaten a lot.

BUT HOW DO I PRONOUNCE PHO?

In America, many people like to ignore the accent and pronounce it
Pho. This is incorrect and may be insulting if heard by someone
Vietnamese. When pronouncing Pho, don't forget that's an o, not an o.
If that doesn't help, it is kind of pronounced like "fuh".

THE TAO OF PHo

Many philosophers have attempted to relate Pho to everyday life. The
most common theory about Pho and Life was written down hundreds of
years ago on parchment by an unknown philosopher.

He said the following:

Life is like a big bowl of Pho. It is constantly surprising you with
things unexpected. When you get meatballs, it means you are having
rocky times. When you get beef tripe, you are having trouble
internally with your emotions.

BUT WHERE CAN I FIND PHO?

Unfortunately, no one has made Pho in a can yet. So, in order to find
Pho it would help if you live in a big city or an area with a large
Vietnamese population. Check your local Yellow Pages for the Pho
nearest you!
