Preheat oven at 350. Prepare pizza pan with cooking spray and flour.
To prepare crust, in a mixing bowl, combine for 30 seconds 1 1/4 cups
flour, yeast, salt, water, and oil. Beat for 3 minutes more. Using a
spoon, stir in as much remaining flour as you can. Turn out onto
lightly floured surface. Knead in enough flour to make a stiff dough
that is smooth and elastic. Cover; let rest for 10 minutes.  To
prepare sauce, heat oil in a skillet and cook onion and bell peppers
over medium heat, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add tomato sauce,tomato
paste, chili powder, red pepper, black pepper, parsley, and beans,
after lightly mashed. Spoon mixture evenly over crust. Sprinkle
cheeses evenly over crust. Bake for 15 minutes or until crust is
golden. Remove from oven, let stand for 2 to 3 minutes, then cut into
slices.
