Title: Cream Cheese-Lemon Pound Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1    Yellow cake mix
8 oz Cream cheese
4    Eggs
3 oz Lemon gelatin powder
3/4 c  Milk
1/2 ts Lemon extract
2 tb Lemon zest
* Use regular size cake mix, non-pudding type. Grate lemon peel for
zest, careful not to include any of the white part of the peel.

1. Place the cream cheese in large bowl. Beat at medium speed with
electric mixer until cream cheese is light and fluffy. Add eggs, one
at a time, beating well after each addition. 2. Blend together the
gelatin and cake mix; add alternately with the milk, in two or three
additions, to the cream cheese mixture. Beat just until smooth, do
not overmix. Stir in the extract and lemon zest. 3. Grease and flour
a tube or bundt pan. Pour in the mix and bake in a preheated
350-degree oven for 50-55 minutes, checking after 50 minutes. Serve
this alone, or, if you prefer, make a thin glaze to pour over top
from confectioner's sugar and lemon juice.
