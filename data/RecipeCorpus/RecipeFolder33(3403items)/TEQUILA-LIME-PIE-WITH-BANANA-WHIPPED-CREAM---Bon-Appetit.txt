FOR CRUST: Combine flour and salt in processor. Add shortening and
butter and cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse
meal. Using on/off turns, gradually blend in enough water until
mixture forms moist clumps. Gather dough into ball; flatten into
disk. Wrap in plastic and chill 30 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead.)

Preheat oven to 350'F. Roll out dough on floured surface to 16-inch
round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Cut off excess
dough, leaving 1/2-inch overhang. Fold overhang under to form
double-thick edge. Crimp edge decoratively. Pierce crust all over
with fork. Bake until crust is golden, piercing bottom if crust
bubbles, about 35 min- utes. Transfer to rack and cool.

FOR FILLING: Whisk first 5 ingredients in top of double boiler to
blend. Set over simmering water and whisk until custard thickens and
registers 170'F on candy thermometer, about 4 minutes. Remove from
over water. Add butter and whisk until melted. Cool slightly. Pour
filling into crust. Refrigerate until filling sets, at least 3 hours
or overnight.

FOR TOPPING: Puree ripe banana in processor. Using electric mixer,
beat cream and sugar in medium bowl to stiff peaks. Fold banana into
cream.

Spoon topping over pie. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead; r@gerate.)
Cut into wedges and serve.
