Title: Thai Sweet & Sour Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Appetizers
Yield: 6 servings
2 1/2 tb Garlic -- chopped (opt)
5 md Chilies (or to taste)
1/2 c  Vinegar
3/4 c  Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
Nam Pla (Thai fish sauce) --
See note below
Puree chilies (and garlic, if used) in vinegar in a blender and pour
into a small saucepan. Add sugar and salt. Cook over low heat until
the liquid is syrupy, stirring constantly. Cool and serve. Great with
fried spring rolls. NOTE: Store the sauce in a glass jar in the
fridge. It'll keep up to a month. Reheat in the microwave about 1
minute before serving. NOTE: (Added by Terry) Most Thai restaurants
I've eaten in also include a spall amount of Nam Pla in the
sweet/sour sauce. The fish sauce is very strong so add and taste a
few drops at a time.
