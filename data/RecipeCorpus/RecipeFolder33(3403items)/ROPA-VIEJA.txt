Ropa vieja ("old clothes" in Spanish) was a traditional way to serve
leftover roasts in old Cuba. The tomatoes, garlic, onions, and green
peppers that form so much of the traditional seasoning of Spanish
America are found here. This is traditionally served with French-
fried potatoes. Ingredients: 2 pounds leftover pot roast 2 tsp salt

freshly ground black pepper to taste    2 cloves garlic, minced 3 tbs
2 onions, chopped 2 tomatoes,
2 green bell peppers, chopped 1 tbs
vegetable oil
peeled, chopped
capers Directions: Serves 8. Shred the meat into strips and season it
with the salt, pepper, and garlic. In a large heavy skillet, heat the
oil and brown the onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers for 5 minutes
over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Add the meat and capers.
Lower the heat and continue to cook for 10 minutes. Serve hot. Posted
