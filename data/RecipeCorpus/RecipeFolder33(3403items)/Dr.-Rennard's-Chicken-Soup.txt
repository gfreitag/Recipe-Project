Title: Dr. Rennard's Chicken Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 16 cups
1    Stewing chicken or "hen",
-preferably whole (~4 lb)
3 lg Peeled onions, halved
1 lg Peeled sweet potato, halved
3    Peeled parsnips, halved
2    Peeled turnips, halved
12 lg Peeled carrots, halved (2lb)
6    Celery stalks, halved
1 bn Parsley, trimmed of stems
Salt to taste
Fresh ground pepper to taste
Put chicken in a very large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a
boil and add the root vegetables. Simmer for 1 hour. Add the celery
and parsley and simmer 90 minutes, or until the vegetables are very
soft. Remove the chicken (reserving for another purpose). Drain the
vegetables into a colander, saving all the broth. In a food
processor, puree the vegetables. Return the puree to the broth. Skim
off the fat before serving. (To make fat removal easy, chill the
soup, skim, then reheat to serve.) Add matzoh balls if you like.

NOTE: A stewing chicken, sometimes marked "hen," makes the best soup.
It's often in the supermarket's frozen poultry section. If you can't
find one, substitute a roasting chicken or, as a last resort, a fryer.

NOTE: Leave the chicken whole and vegetables in large chunks to make
them easier to separate after cooking.

THE DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION: Freeze the soup in small containers and
use it when a cold strikes.

THE ACTUAL THERAPUTIC AGENT? Rennard suspects the ingredients, after
prolonged cooking, interact to boost the cold-fighting effect.
