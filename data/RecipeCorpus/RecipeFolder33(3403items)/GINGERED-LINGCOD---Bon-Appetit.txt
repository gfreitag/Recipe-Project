mixture. Season dressing with salt and pepper. (Can be made 4 hours

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Bring 3 C
water to boil in medium saucepan. Stir in rice and salt. Reduce heat
to low, cover and cook until water is absorbed and rice is tender,
about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and keep covered.

Meanwhile, cook sliced carrots in large pot of boiling salted water 3
minutes. Add broccoli florets and cook 2 minutes. Add trimmed snow
peas and cook until vegetables are just crisp-tender, about 1 minute.

alongside and serve.
