Title: Indonesian Beef Satay
Categories: Meats, Indonesian, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Beef flank steak
2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
1    Clove garlic, minced
Green onion tops
4 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Finely chopped onion
1 ts Packed light brown sugar
1/8 ts Curry powder
Fresh pineapple chunks
Cucumber chunks
Red bell pepper strips
Peanut curry sauce
1/2 c  Plain non-fat or low fat
-yogurt
2 tb Cream of coconut
2 tb Creamy peanut butter
1/4 ts Curry powder
1/4 ts Grated fresh ginger
Allow at least 3 hours to marinate the beef.

Initial preparation: Partially freeze beef flank steak to firm. Soak
12-10" bamboo skewers in water at least 10 minutes.

Combine all above ingredients except the beef and peanut curry sauce.

Cut steak slices diagonally against the grain into 1/8 inch thick
slices. Place beef slices in the marinade you made earlier, place in
refrigerator 3 to 4 hours. Turn occasionally.

Prepare peanut curry sauce as follows: plain non-fat or low fat
yogurt, cream of coconut, creamy peanut butter, curry powder, and
grated fresh ginger.

Remove beef from marinade, place meat, pineapple, cucumber chunks,
green onion tops, and red bell peppers on skewers as desired.

Place the skewers with meat and other stuff on it, on the grill, it
should have medium hot coals. Stay close, this doesn't take long. Turn
occasionally and brush with the marinade sauce that you used earlier.
Remove from fire when meat is done to your taste.

Push the meat, etc. from your skewer to your plate. Spoon peanut curry
sauce over it, AND ENJOY!!!

This recipe requires no additional side dishes, but from experience I
can give you a strong hint, finish it off with ice cream, and a
bottle of good Port wine. Trust me ...
