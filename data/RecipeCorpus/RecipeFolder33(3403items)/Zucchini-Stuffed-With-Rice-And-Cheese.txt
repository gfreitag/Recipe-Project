Categories: Pasta/rice, Cheese/eggs, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
2 md Zucchini
1/4 c  Finely chopped onion
1 tb Butter
3/4 c  Cottage cheese
2/3 c  Cooked brown rice
1    Beaten egg
2 tb Chopped parsley
1 ds Salt
1 ds Pepper
Grated Cheddar cheese
Trim the ends off the zucchini and cook in a small amount of boiling
water for about 8 minutes, or until barely tender.  Cool. Cut the
zucchini in half, scoop out the centers, and chop them. Scrape away
any large seeds.

Saute the onion in the butter, and then mix it with the chopped
zucchini, cottage cheese, rice, egg, parsley, salt, and pepper.

Fill the zucchini shells with this mixture and arrange them in a
baking dish.  Bake covered, for 25 minutes in a 350 degrees F oven.
Remove the cover, sprinkle on the grated cheddar, and return to the
oven just long enough to melt the cheese.

Makes 4 servings.
