Make the filling first.  Chop the meat finely and season. Set aside.
Set oven to 375 Ã¸F or Mark 5. Sieve the flour and salt into a bowl.
Boil the lard, water and milk together in a saucepan. Make a well in
the flour and pour in the hot mixture: mix well with a knife and
knead until smooth. Roll out two thirds of the paste on a floured
surface, keeping a third for lids. Cut into 6 circles and press into
deep patty tins. Spoon the meat into each tin, moistening each
filling with a spoonful of stock, gravy or water. Cut the remaining
dough into 6 smaller circles for lids. Brush the edges with water and
seal. Make a split in each pie lid to allow steam to escape. Brush
with egg yolk.  Cook for 30-40 minutes. Serve hot or cold.

As a variation, add some chopped onion, mushrooms and/or parsley to
the filling.
