Title: Frijoles Negros A La Oaxaca (Black Beans)
Categories: Tex/mexican, Vegetables
Yield: 12 servings
2 lb Black beans -- * see note
12 c  Water
2    Garlic cloves -- chopped
1    Onion -- chopped
1 1/2 ts Cumin seed
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
1 1/2 lb Ham hocks -- ** see note
This dish takes about 10 hours to prepare, so plan ahead.

* Dried pinto beans can be used, but the recipe will lose its
authenticity. ** Use about 1-2 pounds of meaty ham hocks.

Pick over beans, wash thoroughly and drain. Place in very large
casserole. Cover with the water; add garlic, cumin, onion, salt,
pepper and ham hocks. Cover tightly and bake at 275 degrees for about
10 hours, or until beans are tender. Check and stir a few times,
keeping beans from drying out. Skim off fat before serving. Season to
taste.
