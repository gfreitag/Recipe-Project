MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 c  Margarine
2 c  Confectioner's sugar
4 tb Milk
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/2 c  Creamy peanut butter
For the muffins, line 24 (2-1/2 inch) muffin pans with paper liners.
Use a non-pudding type cake mix. Place the cake mix in a large bowl
along with the peanut butter. Use an electric mixer at medium speed
to mix until coarse crumbs form. Continue with cake mix directions
but omit the oil called for on package. Spoon batter into muffin
cups, filling each half full. Top each with 1 teaspoon jelly. Add
enough batter to cover jelly, filling each cup to 3/4 full. Bake in
preheated 350-degree oven for 20 minutes or until cakes spring back
when lightly touched. Cool in pan on wire rack for 10 minutes. Frost
if desired.

FROSTING: Place cocoa and margarine in large bowl. Using a mixer at
medium speed, beat cocoa and margarine until smooth. Gradually beat
in sugar, alternating with milk and vanilla. Beat in peanut butter
until frosting is fluffy.

Yields: 24 cupcakes and enough frosting for all.
