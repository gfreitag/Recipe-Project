Recipe by: Mr. Food Cooks Like Mama

To prepare spaghetti sauce, saute' mushrooms, onions, peppers, and
garlic until tender. Then, add meat and cook until no pink remains.
Drain. Stir in undrained tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, oregano,
basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover; and
simmer for 30 minutes. Then, set aside. Preheat oven at 350. To
prepare stuffing, bring water to a boil in a large pot and add
shells. Return to a boil, then continue cooking for 5 to 6 minutes
more, or until shells are barely tender. Drain and set aside on flat
baking sheet (to prevent sticking). In a mixing bowl, combine cottage
cheese, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg whites,
parsley, salt, and pepper. Pour 1 cup of spaghetti sauce onto bottom
of a 13 x 9 x 2" pan. Fill each shell generously with chesse mixture,
about 1 tablespoon in each shell. Place filled shells in pan. Pour
remaining spaghetti sauce over each shell, then top with remaining
mozzarella cheese. Bake for 45 minutes or until golden.
