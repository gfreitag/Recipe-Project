Title: Deep South Chocolate Pie
Categories: Chocolate, Pie/tart
Yield: 8 servings

3 tb Cocoa
1 1/2 c  Milk
4    Egg yolks
4 tb All-purpose flour
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/2    Stick margarine
MMMMM--------------------------MERINGUE-------------------------------
4    Egg whites
8 tb Sugar
4 tb Cornstarch
1 pn Cream of tartar
1/2 ts Vanilla -- optional
Beat egg yolks. Mix sugar, flour, cocoa and milk together. Blend and
add to egg yolks. Chip up the margarine into small pieces and add to
the egg mixture; add vanilla and blend. Cook over medium heat until
margarine is melted, stirring constantly. Pour into unbaked pie crust
and bake in preheated 350-degree oven until firm and pastry is
browned (about 30 minutes). Check since time will vary.

MERINGUE: In large mixing bowl, combine egg whites and pinch of cream
of tartar. Beat until stiff but not dry. If you desire, add 1/2
teaspoon vanilla extract. Mix 8 tablespoons sugar with 4 tablespoons
cornstarch and gradually add to egg whites. Beat well for at least
five minutes, as mixing too little will cause the meringue to
separate. Spread on top of pie, sealing to edges. Bake for few
minutes until meringue is light golden brown. Cool a few minutes
before slicing.
