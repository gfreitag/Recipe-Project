Title: CUMIN FLATBREAD - Bon Appetit
Categories: Bon appetit, Breads, Side dish
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/3 c  Warm water (105'F to
-115'F)
1    Envelope dry yeast
3 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
1 tb Minced lemon peel
-(yellow part only)
2 1/4 ts Coarse salt
2 ts Ground cumin
3 c  Bread flour
1 tb Cumin seeds
1 tb Sesame seeds
Place warm water in bowl of heavy duty mixer. Sprinkle yeast over and
stir to combine. Let stand 10 minutes. Add oil, lemon peel, salt and
ground cumin. Using dough hook attachment, gradually beat in flour.
Continue beating 5 minutes. Turn out dough onto lightly floured work
surface and knead until smooth dough forms, about 2 minutes (dough
will be very soft).

Lightly oil large bowl. Add dough; turn to coat. Cover with plastic
and let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1
hour.

Preheat oven to 400'F. Line 12x18 inch baking sheet with heavy-duty
foil. Brush foil with oil. Place dough in pan. Using fingertips,
press out dough, covering pan completely (dough will be very thin).
Sprinkle with cumin seeds and sesame seeds. Bake until golden, about
30 minutes. Loosen bread from foil. Serve warm or at room temperature.
