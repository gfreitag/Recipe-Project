This recipe, adapted from the brioche leaf in James Beard's "New
Recipes for the Cuisinart" (Cuisinarts, 1976), can be varied in many
ways. Sprinkle raisins over the cinnamon sugar, for example. Or
sprinkle the rolled-out dough with chocolate chips fold it in the
same way and you'll end up with a nice pain au chocolat. Or spread
the dough with any kind of fruit jam ... you get the picture.

Combine yeast, sugar and milk in small bowl. Set aside to proof.

In food processor combine flour, salt and butter and pulse to cut in
butter finely. Add yeast mixture and pulse again, then add eggs and
process until dough gathers in ball that comes cleanly away from the
sides of work bowl and rides around on top of blade. Process 1
minute. Then remove ball to lightly floured board and knead 1-2
minutes until smooth.

Form dough in smooth ball and place in lightly oiled bowl, turning to
coat all sides of ball. Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Set aside in
warm place to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Alternatively, place kneaded dough ball in lightly sealed plastic
food bag and refrigerate overnight. Dough will rise slowly in plastic
food bag and just need to be brought to room temperature before
rolling out.

When risen, punch dough down and flatten into rectangle. On lightly
floured board, roll out to 1/2" thick. If dough is square, cut in
half. Brush top surface with melted butter and sprinkle with cinnamon
sugar. Fold long side of dough rectangle 2/3 of way across dough.
Fold remaining 1/3 of dough over as in letter. Brush top with butter
and sprinkle again with cinnamon sugar. Cut into 2" wide sections,
transfer to ungreased baking sheet. Let rise again until puffy, 15-20
minutes. Bake at 350'F. 20-30 minutes, until light-brown. Makes 18-20
cinnamon brioches.
