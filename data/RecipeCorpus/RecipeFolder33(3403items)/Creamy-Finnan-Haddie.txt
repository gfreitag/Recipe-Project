1 pt Milk
2 oz Butter
2 tb Flour

**  Finnan Haddies have a lovely subtle flavour ideal for this dish;
other smoked haddock (or salmon), however, can be substituted if
necessary.

Place the fish in a large saucepan.  Cover with the milk. Add the
bayleaf and pepper.  Bring to the boil. Reduce heat and simmer gently
until the fish is cooked.  Carefully lift the fish with a slice,
drain and place in a heated shallow serving dish; cover with foil and
keep warm. Strain the fish milk into a jug.  Melt the butter in a
saucepan. Stir in the flour and mustard.  Cook for 2 minutes. Add the
fish milk. Bring to the boil, stirring continuously until it
thickens. Remove from the heat. Stir in the cream. Reheat the sauce
but do not boil. Pour over the fish. Serve with boiled potatoes and a
fresh green vegetable. Serves 4.
