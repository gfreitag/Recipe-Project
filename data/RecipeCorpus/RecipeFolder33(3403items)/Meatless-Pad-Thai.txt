(Thai Meatless Fried Noodles) Brown garlic in oil in large wok over
medium heat. Add noodles and water, decrease temperature to low.
Saute until noodles become soft. Add a little more water to prevent
drying if necessary. Add tofu, salted radish, peanuts, dried shrimps,
fish sauce, sugar and vinegar. Increase temperature to medium and mix
quickly. Make an empty circle in the middle and add eggs plus 1 tbsp
of oil. Scramble and let sit for 1 minute to cook. Turn the eggs over
and let sit for another minute then break into little pieces with
spatula. Now combine noodles and eggs together well. Increase heat to
high and add bean sprouts. Saute 2-3 minutes longer. Remove from heat
and sprinkle ground chilies, sugar, green onion and lime juice. Serve
hot. Makes 10 servings.

NOTE: When making 1 or 2 servings at a time, oil may need to be
increased to prevent the noodles from sticking together. Use 1 egg
for each serving (10 eggs for 10 individual servings instead of 6
eggs for 10 whole servings) Adjust seasonings to taste. Happy (Thai)
