Categories: Fruit, Relishes, Newspaper
Yield: 6 cups
5 c  White part of the watermelon
-  rind
4 tb Salt
6 c  Water
4 c  Sugar
2 c  White vinegar
1    Lemon; thinly sliced

Read "Canning Chutneys and Pickles" first.

Peel the outer thin green skin off the whole watermelon first.  (It is
easier to cut off while whole.)  Cut the watermelon into wedges and
remove and reserve the pink flesh for another purpose (such as
eating! ;+} ))

Cut the white rind into 1-inch pieces and put into a large bowl.
Sprinkle with salt and add cold water to cover.  Soak overnight -- at
least 12 hours.  Drain the pieces in a colander and rinse well with
cold water.

Place in a saucepan, cover with water, bring to a boil and boil for
10 to 15 minutes or until the flesh can be pierced with a knife.

Drain in the colander.

Combine the remaining ingredients in a large saucepan and bring to a
boil. Cook 10 minutes, then add the rind and simmer gently uncovered
for about 1 hour or until the rind is clear.  Remove the fresh ginger.

Ladle pickles and liquid into warm jars cleaned by the dishwasher
method, leaving 1/4-inch space for expansion.  Divide the lemon
slices and spices among the jars.  Secure with lids washed and heated
according to directions.

Screw on the lids and process in boiling water for 10 minutes.
Remove onto towel or board and allow to cool, then store in a cool
dark place. Lable and decorate.

** NOTE:  Whole preserved ginger is available at Asian grocers.
