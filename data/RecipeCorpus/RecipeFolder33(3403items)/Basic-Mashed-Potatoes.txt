Title: Basic Mashed Potatoes
Categories: Vegetables, Potatoes
Yield: 8 servings
2 lb Baking potatoes, cubed
3/4 ts Salt
4 tb Butter, softened
1 c  Milk, warmed
1/8 tb Pepper, ground
Bring pot of water and 1/2 teaspoon salt to boil. Drop in potato
chunks. Cook until tender, about 15 minutes, depending on size of
potato chunks. Drain and allow potatoes to set for 2 minutes. Return
to warm, dry saucepan over medium-low heat. Toss potatoes for about 2
minutes more, then remove from heat and mash potatoes with a fork (or
put through a food mill or ricer). Using a wire whisk, hand-held
mixer of potato masher, beat in butter and milk 2-3 tablespoons at a
time.

Season with additional salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately or
keep warm in top half of a double boiler.
