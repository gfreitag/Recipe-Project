CREPES:

Combine flour, salt, eggs and egg yolk.  Gradually stir in milk and
water. Beat until smooth.  Chill for 1/2 hour.  Heat crepe pan until
very hot and brush with melted butter.  Pour batter to form a very
thin layer. Cook until golden brown and then cook other side. (Note
from me: I never cook the other side of a crepe.)

LUCIFER FILLING:

Whip together cream cheese, chocolate and enough milk to make fluffy
filling.  Spoon filling in crepes, roll, and serve with Flaming
Lucifer Sauce.

FLAMING LUCIFER SAUCE:

Combine butter, sugar, cornstarch and water in large skillet and heat,
stirring, over low heat until butter melts.  Add 3 tablespoons creme
de cacao and simmer 5 minutes.  Add remaining creme de cacao and
brandy or rum.  Ignite and pour over crepes.

From "The Seven Chocolate Sins" by Ruth Moorman & Lalla Williams,
1980.

This book has some great recipes but they are not carefully edited
and do contain some obvious mistakes.  But I usually read the recipes
care- fully and make any adjustments that I think they should have
said <grin>. I have tried a few from this book and we loved them all.

BTW, the book is divided into the seven deadly sins; this is from the
sin of gluttony (one of my favorite sins...).
