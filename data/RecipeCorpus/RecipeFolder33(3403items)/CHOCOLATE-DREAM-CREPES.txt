MMMMM---------------------------CREPES--------------------------------
1/2 c  Flour
1 tb Cocoa
2 ts Sugar
1 ds Salt
3/4 c  Milk
1/4 ts Almond extract
1    Egg
2 ts Butter; melted
Oil
Filling:  Combine chocolate chips and butter in the top of a double
boiler; bring water to a boil.  Reduce heat to low; cook, stirring
often, until chocolate melts.  Remove from heat.  Add confectioners'
sugar, Karo, creme de cacao, water, and vanilla, and stir until
smooth.

Spoon about 3 tablespoons ice cream down the center of each cr#pe;
fold sides over, and place seam side with on serving dishes.  Spoon
warm chocolate sauce over each; sprinkle with pecans.

Cr#pes:  Combine flour, cocoa, sugar, and salt.  Add milk and almond
extract; beat until smooth.  Add egg and beat well; stir in butter.
Refrigerate 2 hours.

Brush bottom of a 6" cr#pe pan or heavy skillet with oil; place over
medium heat until just hot, not smoking.

Pour 2 tablespoons batter into pan; quickly tilt pan in all
directions so batter covers the pan in a thin film.  Cook 1 minute or
until lightly browned.

Lift edge of cr#pe to test for doneness.  Cr#pe is ready for flipping
when it can be shaken loose from the pan.  Flip the cr#pe, and cook
about 30 seconds on the other side. (This side is rarely more than
spotty brown, and is the side on which the filling is placed.) Place
cr#pes on a towel to cool.  Stack between layers of waxed paper to
prevent sticking. Repeat until all batter is used.
