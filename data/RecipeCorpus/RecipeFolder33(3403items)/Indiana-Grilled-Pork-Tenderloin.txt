One secret of this cookout recipe from Pat and Jeryl Hochstedler of
Goshen, Indiana, is their method of "injecting" the meat using a
special cooking syringe. We revised their recipe so you can baste the
tenderloin with Pat and Jeryl's savory sauce, a winner at the Elkhart
County Fair.

1. For the basting sauce, in a small saucepan, stir together all
ingredients, except the pork.

2. In a covered grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan.
Test for medium heat above the pan. Place tenderloin on the grill
rack over drip pan, but not over coals.

3. Insert a meat thermometer. Baste meat with sauce. Lower the grill
hood.

4. Grill the meat for about 30 to 45 minutes or till a thermometer
registers 160-F to 170-F, brushing frequently with sauce. Store the
remaining basting sauce in the refrigerator. Bring the sauce to
boiling before using it again.
