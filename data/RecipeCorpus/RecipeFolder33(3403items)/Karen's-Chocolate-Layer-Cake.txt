Preheat the oven to 350.  Grease and flour 2 9-inch round cake
pans.
Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and instant
coffee powder.  In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks until
well-blended. Beat the butter and shortening in a bowl with a mixer
till creamy. Gradually beat in the sugar till light and fluffy.  Beat
in the egg yolks, melted chocolate, and vanilla.  At low speed, beat
in the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk, beginning and
ending with dry ingredients. Beat until blended.  Beat the egg whites
in a clean bowl with clean beaters till foamy.  Gradually increase
the speed and beat till stiff peaks form. Fold gently into the batter.
Pour the batter into the prepared pans.  Bake for 30 to 35
minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cool in the pans on wire racks for 10 minutes.  Unmold and cool
completely. Fill and frost the cake when completely cooled.
