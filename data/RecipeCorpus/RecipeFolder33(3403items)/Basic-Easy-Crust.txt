Title: Basic Easy Crust
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 2 -9" crusts
3 c  All-purpose Flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Margarine
1/2 c  Crisco
1    Egg
1 tb White Vinegar
3 tb Ice Water, increase to 4
- tablespoons if necessary
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Using a pastry
blender, cut in the margarine and shortening. Keep working the flour
and shortening until the mixture is rather grainy, like coarse
cornmeal.

Mix the egg and vinegar together and, using a wooden fork, stir the
mixture into the flour.  Add enough of the ice water so that the
dough barely holds together. Place on a marble pastry board or a
plastic countertop and knead for just a few turns, enough so that the
dough holds together and becomes rollable.

Jeff Smith, The Frugal Gourmet, says: "I roll out my dough on a piece
of waxed paper.  It is easy to handle that way. If you have a marble
rolling pin, the rolling out will be easy. If you use a wooden one,
be sure to dust a teaspoon of flour on it a couple of times when you
are rolling out the dough."
