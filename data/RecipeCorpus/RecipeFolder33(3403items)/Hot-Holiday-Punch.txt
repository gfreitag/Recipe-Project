Recipe by: Jo Anne Merrill Preparation Time: 0:15 Cinnamon sticks are
optional but make a very pretty addition as stirrers in steaming hot
mugs of punch.  Combine all the ingredients in a very large heavy
pan, except the cinnamon sticks.  Bring to a boil and turn to simmer
for few minutes. You can put the ingredients in a crockpot after it
has boiled and keep warm over low heat.
