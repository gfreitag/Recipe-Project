1 tb Mayonnaise
1 ts Prepared mustard

Midnights are made with soft egg buns, which are available in Spanish
markets.  Midnights are made commercially in a sandwich grill, but
the home cook will have excellent results using an oven.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Spread one half of each bun with
mayonnaise, and the remaining halves or slices with mustard.
Distribute the filling ingredients evenly between the
mayonnaise-spread halves, starting with the pickle, followed by the
cheese, pork, and ham, and top with mustard- spread halves, making 2
sandwiches.

Place the sandwiches on a lightly oiled baking sheet and brush the
tops lightly with butter.  Place a heavy cast- iron skillet over both
sandwiches to weigh them down and bake until crisp and hot, 15 to 20
minutes. Makes 2 sandwiches. From: Earl Shelsby Date: 09-15-94
