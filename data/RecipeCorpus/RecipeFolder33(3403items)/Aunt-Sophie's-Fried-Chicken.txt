Title: Aunt Sophie's Fried Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb - 3 lb frying chicken; cut
-up
1 c  Flour;
1 tb Salt; or TO TASTE
1 tb Paprika;
1/2 ts Ground red pepper;
2 c  Shortening;
Wash chicken and dry it well on a towel.  In a brown bag, mix the
flour, salt, paprika and pepper together.  Shake the chicken, a few
pieces at time, in the bag.  Heat shortening to the point of smoking
in two 10" black iron skillets, if you have them or any heavy pan and
pans. The objective is to have enough space to keep the pieces of
chicken from touching. Put 6 pieces of chicken, skin side down in
each pan. Leave flame on high for 5 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium,
cover pan and cook 15 minutes. Chicken should be crisp on the outside
and moist inside. Lay on a brown paper bag to drain, then place on a
baking sheet on a rack and keep warm in a 300 degrees oven. Serves 6.
