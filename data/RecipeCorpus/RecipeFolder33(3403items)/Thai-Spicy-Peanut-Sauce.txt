Yield: 4 servings
BAMBERGER
1/2 c  Coconut milk
2 tb Red curry paste
1/2 c  Chunky-style peanut butter
1/2 c  Chicken stock
3 tb Brown sugar
2 tb Tamarind liquid -- or
Squeezed lime juice
1 tb Fish sauce
1/2 ts Salt
Warm the coconut milk in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stirring
occasionally, heat the milk until it reaches a gentle boil and tiny
beads of oil glisten on the surface, about 5 minutes. Add the curry
paste and stir occasionally until it dissolves into the coconut milk
and releases its fragrance, about 3 minutes.  Add the peanut butter,
chicken stock, and sugar and cook gently until the sauce is smooth,
about 5 minutes.

Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining ingredients.
