One bite of this light, sweet loaf and you can feel the tropical
breezes. The pineapple and coconut add sweetness and flavor, but the
macadamia nuts are the real stars of the show.  This is one bread
that's better served cool than hot - the pineapple is especially
enhanced with cooling.

Success Hints
-------------

* Pineapple should be unsweetened crushed.  Drain well.  For extra
flavor, reserved pineapple juice may be substituted for up to 2/3 of
the water.

** Macadamia nuts should be quartered or coursely chopped.

Use regular or rapid bake cycle.
