The name comes from the French word, jambon, meaning ham.

Put sausage in large, heavy iron skillet and cook. Add onions and let
cook with sausage until onions are clear. Add parsley and garlic.
Cook for a few minutes until parsley is limp. Add water, tomatoes
(mashed with spoon), thyme, and salt. Bring to a boil. (May be
prepared in advance to this point.) If made in advance, bring this
mixture to a boil again. Add rice and shrimp. Stir once and put heat
on low and cover. Do not stir again. You may check the mixture and
lift with fork if it is sticking. If it looks like more liquid is
needed, add 1/2 cup water. Cook the rice approximately 30 minutes or
until the grains of rice are tender and separate easily. It can be
held until time to serve. Serves 40. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI
