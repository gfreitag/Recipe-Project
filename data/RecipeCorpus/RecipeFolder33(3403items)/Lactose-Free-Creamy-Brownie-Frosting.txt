Title: Lactose Free Creamy Brownie Frosting
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
3 tb Butter flavored Crisco
3 tb Dutch process cocoa
1 tb Honey
1/4 ts Vanilla
1/4 ts Almond extract
1 c  Powdered sugar
1 tb Non dairy liquid creamer
In a small bowl cream Crisco, cocoa, honey and flavorings. Add
powdered sugar and creamer. Beat to spreading consistency, adding
additional creamer if needed.  Makes frosting for one 9x13 cake or 20
- 24 cupcakes.

Notes: I created this for my mother who is lactose intolerant because
she dearly loves chocolate frosting.  You could use water as the
liquid in this, however the creamer makes a richer tasting frosting.
