Title: Top Gun Bourbon And Sweet Potato Pie
Categories: Pie/tart, Holiday
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Sweet potatoes -- mashed
3    Eggs
4 tb Margarine
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
1 ts Nutmeg
1 tb Lemon juice
1/2 c  Bourbon
1    9 inch pie crust -- unbaked
Mix together all ingredients thoroughly. Pour into 9-inch unbaked pie
crust and bake at 325 degrees for 45 minutes. This has a strong
bourbon taste. You might want to use only half the bourbon called for
with another liquid to make up the remaining liquid needed.
