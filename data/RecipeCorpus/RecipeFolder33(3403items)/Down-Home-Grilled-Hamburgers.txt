3    Green onions -- chopped,
With tops
3 tb Bread crumbs
1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
1/2 ts Lemon pepper
1 lb Lean ground beef

1. Prepare white or yellow sweet onion by slicing in thick slices,
place in plastic bag or glass jar with ice water, seal and
refrigerate until ready to use. This makes the onions very crisp and
juicy.

2. Slice a vine-ripened tomato into thick slices. Mix sour cream,
chopped green onions, bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce and lemon
pepper seasoning. Mix this in with the ground meat until combined
well. Shape into 4 patties.

3. Cooking the hamburger patties:

GRILL: Place meat on grill over hot coals and cook to desired
doneness, turning only once or twice.

BROIL: Place meat in broiler pan; broil to desired doneness.

MICROWAVE: Place meat in a microwave-safe dish and cover loosely with
plastic wrap (made for microwave purposes); vent one edge slightly.
Microwave on highest power for 3 minutes. Turn patties over and cook 3
minutes longer or until desired doneness. Rotate the dish 1/4 turn
every 1-2 minutes. Drain well.

4. Mix the mayonnaise, mustard and catsup. Blend well.

5. To serve, divide the catsup mixture evenly on the warmed hamburger
buns, top with a meat patty, tomato slice, onion slice and shredded
lettuce. Also good with alfalfa or radish sprouts.

Serving Ideas:  Serve on July 4th with baked beans, coleslaw and
watermelon.
