Yield: 12 servings
MMMMM------------------------FIRST LAYER-----------------------------
1/4 c  Cold water
1 tb Gelatin
4 c  Cranberry sauce -- 2 cans
1 c  Crushed pineapple
1/2 c  Black walnuts -- chopped
MMMMM------------------------SECOND LAYER-----------------------------

1/4 c  Cold water
1 tb Gelatin
1 c  Mayonnaise
1/2 c  Evaporated milk
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Black pepper -- or white
Cranberry layer: 1. Put into a small bowl the 1/4 cup cold water and
sprinkle in 1 envelope gelatin. Let soften for 5 minutes. 2. Blend in
large bowl 4 cups whole cranberry sauce (two 16-ounce cans), drained
crushed pineapple and the walnuts. 3. Dissolve gelatin thoroughly by
placing bowl in very hot water. When gelatin is dissolved, stir it
and then blend into the cranberry mixture. Put mixture into a mold.
You will need a 3-quart mold that has been lightly oiled for this
recipe. Do not use olive oil. Chill mixture until slightly set.

Chicken layer: 4. Repeat for gelatin as in first layer. Blend
together the mayonnaise, evaporated milk, salt and pepper. Stir in
the dissolved gelatin. Fold in the chicken, celery and parsley. 5.
When first layer is slightly set (the consistency of unbeaten egg
whites) turn the chicken mixture onto the cranberry layer. 6.
Refrigerate until firm. Unmold onto chilled serving platter,
decorated with curly lettuce if you prefer. Serve with additional
mayonnaise.
