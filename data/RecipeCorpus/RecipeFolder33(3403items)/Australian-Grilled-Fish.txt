Title: Australian Grilled Fish
Categories: Bbq/grill, Down under, Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
4    Fish steaks
1/4 c  Lime juice
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 ts Dijon mustard
2 ts Fresh ginger root -- grated
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
Black pepper
* For the steaks: they should be 8-10 ounces and 1-inch thick each.
Use Swordfish, Halibut or Salmon steaks.

1. In a bowl, combine the lime juice, 1 tablespoon oil, ginger,
cayenne pepper and enough freshly ground black pepper to suit your
taste. 2. Marinate the fish in the marinade for 45-60 minutes. Turn
steaks 2-3 times. 3. Have the grill prepared with white coals and
brush the cooking grill with the remaining one tablespoon oil. 4.
Grill the fish, brushing several times with the marinade, until
cooked through and opaque in the center. Turn fish after about 4-5
minutes. Total grilling time will depend on your grill and the heat
of the coals.

* To broil instead, use a broiler pan brushed with oil and broil until
center is opaque. Will take about 10 minutes total in broiler. Turn
steaks after 5 minutes, and baste often with marinade.
