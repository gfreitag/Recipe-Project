Unique is the word for this loaf.  Don't let the combination of
ingredients scare you off - the texture created by the feta cheese
combined with the smallest hint of cucumber makes this a wonderful
bread. This is definitely a bread to accompany a hot meal; try it
with char-grilled marinated lamb chops or your favorite lamb kabobs.

Success Hints
-------------

Cucumber should be peeled, seeded and then pureed.

If the feta cheese is packed in water, drain well.

Use regular or rapid bake cycle.
