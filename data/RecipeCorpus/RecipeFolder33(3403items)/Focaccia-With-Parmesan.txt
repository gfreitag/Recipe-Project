Title: Focaccia With Parmesan
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Breads
Yield: 4 servings
1 pk Yeast -- not instant
1 ts Sugar
1 1/4 c  Warm water
2 3/4 c  Bread flour
6 tb Olive oil
1/2 ts Salt
4 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 ts Dried rosemary -- crushed
1 tb Cornmeal
1 ts Salt -- coarse
Black pepper
1. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 3/4 cup warm water, about 110
degrees. Set aside for 15 minutes until very foamy. 2. Stir 1 cup
flour into the yeast. Cover with plastic wrap and let this sponge
proof in a warm place until tripled in volume and very bubbly, about
3 hours. 3. Into the yeast mixture add the remaining 1/2 cup warm
water, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon regular salt, Parmesan
cheese and rosemary. Add enough of the remaining flour to form a soft
and workable dough. Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth
and elastic, about 10 minutes. 4. Oil a large bowl. Put the dough
into the bowl, cover loosely and let rise in a warm place until
doubled in size, about 1-1/2 hours. 5. Sprinkle a baking sheet with
the cornmeal. Divide the dough into 4 parts and roll each into a
circle about 7 inches in diameter. Place on the baking sheet. Use the
tips of your fingers to make dimples in the dough. Spoon a tablespoon
of olive oil on each bread piece and sprinkle with the coarse salt
and pepper. 6. Bake in a preheated 475-degree oven for 20 minutes or
until golden brown.
