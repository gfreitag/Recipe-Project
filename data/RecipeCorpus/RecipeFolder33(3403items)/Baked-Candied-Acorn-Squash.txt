Title: Baked Candied Acorn Squash
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
2    1 1/4 pound acorn squash
- halved & seeded
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
1/4 c  Honey
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/8 ts Ground ginger
1/4 ts Ground mace
1 tb Lemon juice
1 tb Pecans -- chopped
Preheat the oven to 350.  Arrange the squash cut side up in a shallow
baking pan.  In saucepan combine the butter, honey, sugar, cinnamon,
ginger, mace and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring until
the sugar is melted.  Add the lemon juice and divide the mixture
among the squash halves.  Add enough hot water to the baking pan to
reach 1/4" up the sides of the squash and bake the squash in the
oven, basting them occasionally with the sugar mixture, for 1 hour.
Remove the squash from the oven and increase the oven temp to 375.
Drain off all but 2 tbsp water from the pan, sprinkle the pecans into
each squash and bake the squash, basting them occasionally, in the
oven for 15 minutes more, or until they are glazed well and golden.
