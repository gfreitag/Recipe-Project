From Sunset Books "Low-Fat Cookbook."

Soak sun-dried tomatoes in hot water to cover until very soft (about 1
hour). About 30 minutes before serving, heat oil in a 4-5 quart pan
over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, carrot, bell pepper, mushrooms
and eggplant, cook, stirring often, until all liquid has evaporated
and vegetables are soft (about 20 minutes).

Drain soaked tomatoes, discarding liquid; chop tomatoes and add to
eggplant mixture along with peperoncini, Roma tomatoes, zucchini and
olives. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring often, unti almost
all liquid has evaporated (8-10 minutes). Meanwhile, in a 6-8 quart
pan, cook spaghetti in 4 quarts of boiling water just until tender to
the bite (10-12 minutes). Drain well and place in a warm wide serving
bowl.
