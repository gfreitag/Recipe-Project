This heavy, dark bread is a traditional pumpernickel - the kind that
will have you reaching for smoked salmon and cream cheese.  The loaf
is shorter and denser than most becaue of the heavy flours, which
call for an extra knead.  With bread machins, that simply means one
extra button to push.

Success Hints
-------------

Remember the extra knead - use the "whole wheat" cycle or simply
restart the machine after the first knead.

Use regular cycle.
