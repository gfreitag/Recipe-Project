Title: Brunch Coffee Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Breakfast
Yield: 1 cake
3 oz Pkg. cream cheese
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
2 c  Biscuit mix
MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
1 c  Sifted powdered sugar
1/4 ts Vanilla and
1 1/2 tb Milk
1/3 c  7-up
1/2 c  Jam (your choice)
Cut cream cheese and butter into biscuit mix 'til mixture in
crumbly-blend in 7-up.  Turn biscuit dough onto lightly floured
surface and knead 8-10 strokes. Roll dough on wax paper to form
12"x8" rectangle. I make mine a little larger as it doesn't last very
long around here. Turn onto greased baking sheet and remove wax
paper. Spread jam preserves down CENTER of dough. Make 2 1/2" slits
at 1" apart on both long sides of rectangle. Fold each strip over jam
on an angle...like you're making x's. Remember to tuck in the top and
bottom edges too. Bake at 425o for 15-20 min. Drizzle warm coffee
with icing

ICING:
Blend to a spreading consistency, drizzle over the top and enjoy!
