Yield: 12 servings
1    Box cake mix
20 oz Crushed pineapple in syrup
Undrained
1 cn Cherry pie filling
1 c  Pecans -- chopped
1/2 c  Margarine
* Use a standard sized cake mix, but do not use one with pudding in
the mix. Some good choices are German chocolate or plain chocolate
mix. Use a 13 x 9 x 2-inch pan -- important for even baking. Do not
grease pan.

1. Pour the undrained pineapple in pan and spread evenly. Layer the
pie filling fairly evenly over pineapple. Sprinkle the dry cake mix
over and pat down with fingertips VERY LIGHTLY. Sprinkle the chopped
pecans over mix and dot with the margarine cut into tiny pieces. 2.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake for 50-55 minutes, or until set
when pressed lightly with fingers. Serve warm or cold.
