The major work for this salad is cutting up the vegetables. Try to
make all the same size. When you clean your shrimp, leave the tails
on, so they can be picked up easily.

1. Place potatoes in a pot with water to cover and bring to a boil.
Cook until tender, 5-7 minutes. Drain and set aside.

2. Place carrots in a pot with water to cover and bring to a boil.
Cook until tender, about 2 minutes. Drain and set aside.

3. Peel, seed and cut avocado into 1/4" dice. Toss in the lemon juice
and set aside.

4. To prepare salad, cover bottom of a large platter or shallow bowl
with lettuce leaves. Arrange potatoes, carrots, avocado, beets and
pickle - plus eggs and shrimp, if desired - decoratively on top in
rows, wedges or circles. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and chopped dill.
Serve dressing in a bowl alongside.
