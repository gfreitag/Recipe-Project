The seeds inject a crunchy, chewy texture so stisfying, you won't
even need a toaster for crispness.  High in fiter and high in taste,
this bread brings a new dimension to an avocado and sprout sandwich.

Success Hints
-------------

* Experiment with unsalted seeds for different taste and texture; try
equal amounts of pumpkin seeds, flax seeds and sunflower seeds.

For best results, use the "extra knead" process and add seeds near
the end of the first knead.

Gluten is available in health food stores & nutritional departments.

Use regular, rapid bake or timed bake cycle.
