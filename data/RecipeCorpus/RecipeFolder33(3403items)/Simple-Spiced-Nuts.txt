Title: Simple Spiced Nuts
Categories: Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 cup
1 c  Walnuts, pecans, almonds, or
-raw cashews or sunflower
-seeds
2 ts Vegetable oil
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
Heat nuts with vegetable oil until the nuts are evenly golden or
browned and smell toasted. You can do that by stirring them almost
constantly in a skillet, watching carefully so they don't burn. Or
you can spread them on a baking sheet and roast them in a 300-350'F.
oven, shaking occasionally and watching so they don't burn.

When the nuts are toasted, sprinkle with salt, sugar and cayenne. Use
on salads, grilled or roasted vegetables or other vegetable dishes.

Use about 1 tablespoon of nuts per serving of salad or vegetable,
chopping them smaller if desired. Store nuts at room temperature for
no more than 2 weeks, or in the freezer or refrigerator to prevent
them from becoming rancid.
