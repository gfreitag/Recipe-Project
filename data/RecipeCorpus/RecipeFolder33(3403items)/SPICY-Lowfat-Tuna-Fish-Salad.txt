Categories: Fish/seafoo, Hot/spicy, Salads, Low cal/fat
Yield: 4 servings
2 cn Tuna (unsalted)
4    (to 6) Serrano chilis,

20    Cilantro leaves, finely

NOTE:  I HATE the taste of creamy tuna fish with eggs, and I'm always
watching my fat content.  Here's a great (modified) recipe from
the LA Times.  Very easy to make, and super tasty...

Adjust all ingredients to your personal taste.  But the combination of
ingredients always makes this taste great.

Serve with pita breads or with a salad for a light and spicy lunch.
