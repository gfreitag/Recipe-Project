Title: Rhubarb Sauce^
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Oldies, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  To 3 rhubarb, chopped
1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Sugar or more
Put rhubarb and water into a kettle. (If the kettle is stained, it
won't be when you're through.) Bring to a boil and cook a few seconds
until tender. Stir in sugar. Chill and serve. it's good for breakfast
too. this is even better if you put in about 1 cup of strawberries.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
