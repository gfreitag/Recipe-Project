Title: Crispy Roast Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1    Onion, sliced
2    Carrots, peeled and thinly
-sliced
2 c  Chicken stock
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
2 tb Grainy, Dijon-style mustard
1/4 c  Balsamic vinegar
2 tb Soy sauce
3    Garlic cloves, minced
2 ts Minced fresh ginger root
1/4 ts Black pepper
1    Fryer chicken, cleaned and
-patted dry (3 1/2-4 1/2 lb)
Combine the mustard, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and pepper in
a small mixing bowl. Taste for seasoning. Place the chicken in a
large, non-aluminum mixing bowl. Starting around the main body
cavity, carefully slip your hand under the skin, being sure not to
tear it. (You may need to use gloves is you have long fingernails.)
Pat the marinade under the skin and all over the bird on both sides
on top of the skin. Cover the chicken and marinade for at least a few
minutes and up to 8 hours in the refrigerator.

Preheat the oven to 425'F. Place the chicken, breast-side up, on a
rack in a roasting pan or on a vertical roaster. Sprinkle the onion
and carrots on the bottom of the pan and add 1 cup of the stock.
Roast the chicken for about 45 minutes to 1 hr or until the juices
run clear when the thigh is pierced with a knife. Halfway through the
cooking, add the remaining cup of chicken stock to keep the bottom of
the pan from scorching. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before
carving. Carve the chicken and arrange on a serving platter. Remove
the fat and then scrape up the juices and vegetables and pour them
over the chicken pieces to serve.

The chicken can be marinated up to 8 hours ahead and held in the
refrigerator. Also, it can be cooked in advance, then served cold.
