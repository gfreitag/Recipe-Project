FOR CRUST: Combine flour, sugar and ground cinnamon in processor.
Using on/off turns, cut in chilled unsalted butter and vegetable
shortening until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 3 T ice water and
process until moist clumps form. If dough is too dry, add more ice
water by teaspoonfuls. Gather dough into ball. Flatten into disk.
Wrap dough tightly in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour. (Crust can be
prepared 3 days ahead. Keep refrigerated. Let dough soften slightly
at room temperature before rolling.)

FOR FILLING: Combine fresh lemon juice, sugar, eggs, egg yolks and
grated lemon peel in top of double burner set over simmering water
(do not let top of double bouer touch water). Whisk until mixture is
thick and thermometer registers 160F, about 13 minutes (do not boil).
Remove from heat. Gradually add butter, whisking just until melted.
Refrig- erate lemon curd filling until cold, stirring occasionally,
about 1 hour. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

Preheat oven to 350'F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to
15- inch round. Transfer dough to 11-inch diameter tart pan with
removable bottom. Gently press dough into place; freeze 15 minutes,

Line crust with aluminum foil. Fill crust with dried beans or pie
weights. Bake 15 minutes. Remove beans and aluminum foil and bake
until crust is golden brown, piercing with fork if crust bubbles,
about 25 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool completely.

Pour lemon filling into prepared tart crust. Cover and refrigerate
until filling is set, about 3 hours. Transfer to platter. Cut lemon
tart into wedges and serve with sauce.
