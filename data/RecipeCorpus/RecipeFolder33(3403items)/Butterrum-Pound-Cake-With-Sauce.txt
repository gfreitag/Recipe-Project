Title: Butterrum Pound Cake With Sauce
Categories: Cake/cookie, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Butter -- * see note
1/4 c  Packed brown sugar
2 tb Whole milk
1 c  Confectioner's sugar
1 ts Rum -- ** see note
1 lb Cake
* Using real butter yields a richer-tasting cake, but solid margarine
can also be used -- NOT diet or soft margarine. ** Add vanilla
flavoring instead of rum if preferred.

Purchase a pound cake or prepare one from a mix, following directions
on package. For the frosting, combine butter, brown sugar, and milk
in a saucepan. Bring to a full boil and add the confectioner's sugar
and rum or vanilla flavoring. With a whisk, beat mixture until
smooth. Add a bit more milk if needed, to make a fairly thin sauce
that will pour easily onto cake. Punch holes in cake with fork tines.
Pour the warm sauce slowly over cake.
