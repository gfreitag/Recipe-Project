BEANS: Place white beans and red beans in large pot. Add enough cold
water to cover by 4 inches. Bring to boil over high heat; boil 2
minutes. Remove from heat. Cover and let beans stand 1 hour.

Drain beans. Rinse well and return to pot. Add ham hocks and next 4
in- gredients. Season with pepper. Bring to simmer over high heat.
Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until beans are tender but not
soft, stirring occasionally, about 50 minutes. Add lima beans. (Can
be made 1 day ahead. Cool 1 hour. Refrigerate beans in their cooking
liquid.)

MEATS AND LEEKS: Heat heavy 12-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
Season duck with 3/4 t allspice, salt and pepper. Cook duck in
batches in Dutch oven until brown on all sides, about 20 minutes per
batch. Return all duck pieces to Dutch oven; cover and cook duck
until tender, turning occasionally, about 15 minutes. Using tongs,
transfer duck to large bowl. Season lamb with 3/4 teaspoon allspice,
salt and pepper. Fry lamb in duck drippings in same Dutch oven until
brown, about 6 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer lamb to another
bowl. Season pork with remaining 3/4 t allspice, salt and pepper. Fry
pork in same Dutch oven until brown, about 6 minutes. Using slotted
spoon, transfer pork to another bowl. Spoon off and discard all but 2
T duck drippings.

Add leeks to same Dutch oven and saute over medium-high heat until
gold- en, scraping bottom of pot occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add
wine; boil until reduced to glaze, scraping up browned bits, about 5
minutes. Transfer leek mixture to small bowl. Set aside.

Discard ham hocks from beans. If necessary, rewarm bean mixture over
medium-low heat just until heated through, stirring frequently. Using
slotted spoon, transfer 2 C beans to processor. Add 1/2 C bean cooking
liquid to processor and puree. Add bean puree to leek mixture and mix
well.

ASSEMBLY: Preheat oven to 375'F. Using slotted spoon, transfer 4 C
beans to 12-quart Dutch oven. Arrange half of duck, lamb, pork and
sausage over. Sprinkle with half of garlic, rosemary, thyme and bay
leaves. Sprinkle with half of Cognac. Spoon 1 can drained tomatoes
over. Spoon half of leek-bean mixture over. Season with salt and
pepper. Repeat layering with 4 C beans, meats, garlic, herbs, bay
leaves, Cognac, tomatoes and leek-bean mixture. Season with salt and
pepper. Top with remaining beans. Pour remaining bean cooking liquid
over.

Cover cassoulet and bake 1 1/2 hours. Uncover and bake until juices
thicken, pressing every 30 minutes to submerge crisp top layer, about
1 1/2 hours longer. (Can be prepared 4 days ahead. Cool 1 hour.
Refrigerate; cover when cold. Before continuing, rewarm covered
cassoulet in 400'F oven 1 1/2 hours. Uncover and cook until bubbling
and heated through, about 45 minutes more.)

TOPPING: Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add
breadcrumbs saute until crisp and golden, about 8 minutes. Set aside.
Mix tomatoes and parsley in bowl. Season with vinegar, salt and
pepper. Serve cassoulet, passing breadcrumbs and tomato mixture
separately.
