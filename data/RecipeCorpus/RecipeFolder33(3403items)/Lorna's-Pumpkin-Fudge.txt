This unforgettable fudge from Lorna Brandt of Cherokee, Iowa, was a
winner at the Clay County Fair. The pumpkin adds a unique flavor and
golden color.

1. Butter a 13x9x2-inch baking pan.

2. In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, combine sugar, butter, evaporated
milk, pumpkin, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg.

3. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat. Boil
over medium-low heat till mixture registers 234-F (soft-ball stage)
on a candy thermometer, stirring constantly (should take about 25
minutes).

marshmallow creme, nuts and vanilla. Mix till well combined.

temperature. Cut into squares. Wrap tightly and store in refrigerator.
