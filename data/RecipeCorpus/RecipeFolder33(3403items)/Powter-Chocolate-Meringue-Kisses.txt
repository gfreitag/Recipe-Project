Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 10 servings
1 tb Sifted cocoa powder
1 oz Unsweetened chocolate
-melted and cooled
4    Extra large egg whites
1 pn Salt
1 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
;extra cocoa powder for
;dusting sheets
Preheat oven 300.  Grease 3 cookie sheets lightly and dust with cocoa
powder.  Shake sheets lightly to completely cover with cocoa.  You
will need about 3 cookie sheets because this recipe makes 50 cookies,
and you will want to bake them one after another.

Melt chocolate, then set aside to cool.

Beat egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form.  The eggs
must form soft peaks or the cookies will not hold their shape.

Add sugar slowly and continue beating until very stiff and shiny.

Using a spatula, fold in vanilla extract, melted chocolate, and 1T
cocoa powder until incorporated.

Drop on cookie sheets 1 heaping teaspoon at a time.  Space the
mixture 2 inches apart.  They will have the shape of chocolate kisses.

Bake 30-40 mins.  Remove cookies immediately from cookie sheet.  Cool
completely and store in an airtight container.
