Tomorrow is Thanksgiving in Canada and I thought I'd share my recipe
for smoked turkey.  I can almost guarantee that once you've had it,
it'll never go back in the range oven or God forbid microwave again.

You need a smoker.  I would suggest a wet smoker.  I paid $72.95
Canadian for mine.  It looks like a big pot on three legs with a
domed top.

A 15 pound turkey is about as big as will fit.

In addition to the smoker you need:

Unstuffed turkey Meat thermometer (optional)

Something that makes fire to light the charcoal with.  The two sticks
approach takes too long <grin>..  A Bic or equivalent will do nicely.

There are two porcelin <--Spelling coated metal bowls inside the
smoker. Fill the bottom bowl with charcoal and light it off.  In the
meantime soak about two cups of wood chips in water for 20-30
minutes.  When the charcoal is good and hot sprinkle about 1/2 of the
would chips on the charcoal. Put 2 quarts of water, the rosemary and
white wine in the top bowl. Put the grill on top and place your
rinsed and salted turkey on the grill. Place the domed lid in place
and your on your way.

Check the charcoal and water once an hour making sure the charcoal
stays hot and the water bowl is kept about 1/2 full.  Add additional
wood chips every second hour. If your using a thermometer, cook until
you reach the recommended poultry temperature, otherwise cook for
about 1/2 per pound.
