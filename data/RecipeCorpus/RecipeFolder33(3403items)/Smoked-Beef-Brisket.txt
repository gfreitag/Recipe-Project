Prepare marinade and place in a covered dish large enough to hold the
brisket laying flat.  Place the brisket in the refrigerator and
marinate with turning every 6 hours for 48 hours.  Remove from
refrigerator 2 hours before smoking and allow to warm to room
temperature.  Smoke in smoker set at 190-225 oF for 6 to 7 hours.
Place marinade in water pan in smoker.
