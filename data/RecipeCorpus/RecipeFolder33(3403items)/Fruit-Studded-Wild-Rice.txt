Wild rice is a most festive choice for the holidays. Be sure to rinse
it before use, to wash off dust. It's expensive, so I've added white
rice to make enough for eight people. - Sheila Lukins

1. Place the dried cherries, raisins and dried apricots in a small
bowl and cover with boiling water. Let the fruits soak for 30
minutes. Drain the fruits well; reserve.

2. In a heavy saucepan, bring 5 cups of water to a boil. Add the wild
rice, reduce heat slightly and cook at a gentle simmer, uncovered,
for about 40-45 minutes or until rice is just tender. Drain.

3. In another heavy saucepan, bring 2 1/2 cups of water to a boil.
Add the white rice, reduce heat slightly, cover and simmer for 20
minutes or until the rice is tender and all of the liquid has been
absorbed.

4. Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add the
onion and cook, stirring, for 5-7 minutes or until wilted. Add nuts,
if desired, and cook for 2 minutes more, stirring. Remove from heat.

5. Add the drained fruits, the cooked rices, orange zest, orange
juice and parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper, fluffing up
the rice with a fork.
