Categories: Greek, Dips/spread, Tomatoes, Can/preserv
Yield: 1 quart
3 lb Cherry tomatoes
Boiling water
2 ts Slaked lime *
2 qt Water
5 c  Sugar
2 c  Water
1    Cinnamon stick
10    Whole cloves

Wash the firm, ripe cherry tomatoes and blanch in boiling water to
cover. Drain and slip off the skins, and place in a large bowl.
Meanwhile combine the lime with 2 quarts water and shake thoroughly,
allowing residue to settle to bottom of jar.  Pour the lime water
over tomatoes and soak 10 minutes.  Lift tomatoes out of water with
slotted spoon and save the lime water.  Using tip of sharp knife
incise bottom of each tomato with a small cross.  Slightly squeeze
and simultaneously shake each tomato to discard seeds and put back
into the lime water to soak another 30 minutes until firm.  Drain,
thoroughly inverted, on linen towels. To make the syrup, combine the
sugar and 2 cups water in jelly pan, stir and bring to boil. Skim,
add the spices and boil for 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Cool
tomatoes overnight in syrup and continue cooking to soft ball stage.
Remove from heat, add tomatoes.  Cool.  Slip an almond inside each
tomato. Store cherry tomatoes in sealed containers.
