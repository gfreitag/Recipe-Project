Title: Cranachan
Categories: Scot/irish, Breakfast
Yield: 6 servings
1 pt Double cream
3 tb Honey (heather honey
. is best)
3 tb Whiskey (as in good Scotch)
4 tb Yogurt; plain
1 oz Fine oatmeal
6 oz Raspberries
Toast the oatmeal in a pan under a hot grill until golden.  Set aside
to cool.  Put the cream, honey and whisky in a bowl and whip together
until it forms peaks.  Fold in the yoghurt.  Spoon the mixture into a
serving dish and chill in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.  Before
serving, sprinkle the oatmeal over the mixture and pile the
raspberries in the centre. Serves 6.

Ideally Cranachan should be made with Crowdie, a soft Scottish cheese
but yoghurt makes a good substitution.
