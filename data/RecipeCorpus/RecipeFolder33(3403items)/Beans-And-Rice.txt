Combine rice and water in saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat,
cover, and cook for about 50 minutes or until rice is tender and
liquid is absorbed.  While rice cooks, heat oil in a large deep
skillet or saucepan and sautÂŽ garlic, onion and peppers over
medium-low heat until vegetables are wilted (about 10 minutes
depending on how coarsely chopped the peppers are).  Add beans,
tomatoes and juice, thyme, oregano, and hot pepper, stirring to
combine well.  Simmer gently for 15 minutes or until peppers are
tender.  Taste and add salt.  Spoon cooked rice into warmed pasta
bowls and top with the beans mixture.
