Soaking the ham in burgundy, port or red wine will greatly improve the
flavor and tenderness of a bone-in ham.  The wine removes any trace
of salt from the ham and leaves it fork-tender and very sweet.

Score ham, place on smoker grid and smoke according to cooking
charts. Mix brown sugar, mustard, ginger and cloves, adding enough
pineapple juice to make a rather thick paste.  Forty-five minutes
before end of cooking time coat ham with brown sugar mixture and
continue smoking.
