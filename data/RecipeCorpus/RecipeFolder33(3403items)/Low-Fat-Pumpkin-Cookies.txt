Title: Low Fat Pumpkin Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 36 servings
3/4 c  Pumpkin
1/2 c  Fat-free plain yogurt
2 tb Fat-free plain yogurt
1 ts Vanilla
2 c  Unbleached flour
1 c  Raisins
3/4 c  Brown sugar -- packed
2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Ginger
1/2 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Allspice
1/2 ts Nutmeg
Preheat oven at 350.  Prepare baking sheets with cooking spray.  In a
mixing bowl, combine pumpkin, yogurt, and vanilla.  In another mixing
bowl, combine flour, raisins, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, baking
soda, salt, allspice, and nutmeg.  Mix wet ingredients with dry
ingredients just until moistened.  Drop by tablespoonfuls onto
prepared baking sheet, 2" apart. Bake for 15 minutes, until they seem
firm.

Storage: Since these cookies have no added fat they don't store well.
They become stale quickly and stick together if stacked.  As soon as
they cool, wrap in layers separated by wax paper and freeze.  To
serve, simply let them thaw to room temperature.
