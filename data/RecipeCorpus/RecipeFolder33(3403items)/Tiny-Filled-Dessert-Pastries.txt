Categories: Appetizers, Pastry
Yield: 96 servings
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Margarine
2    Egg yolks
1/2 c  Sour cream
2 c  Pecans -- ground
2/3 c  Dark corn syrup
Confectioner's sugar
1. Do not sift flour. Place flour in large bowl. Using pastry blender,
blend in the margarine until coarse crumbs form.

2. Slightly beat the egg yolk and stir into flour along with sour
cream. Mix well. Place on a lightly floured surface and knead until
smooth.

3. Cover and chill 30 minutes.

4. Mix the nuts and corn syrup in small bowl.

5. Roll out half the dough (keeping other half in refrigerator) until
dough is 1/8th inch thick. Cut dough into 2 inch squares. Place 1/2
teaspoon filling on each square, placing diagonally on dough. Moisten
the 2 opposite corners slightly with water; fold over filling and
press edges together with your fingers.

6. Bake on cookie sheet in preheated 400-degree oven for 12 minutes or
until edges are light brown. When cool, sprinkle with sifted
confectioner's sugar. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.

Yield: About 8 dozen squares.
