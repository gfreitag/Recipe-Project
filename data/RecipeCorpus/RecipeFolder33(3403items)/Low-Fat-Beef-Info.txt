* 3 ounces of cooked meat is about the size of a deck of playing
cards.

Before cooking, trim away excess fat using a sharp knife.

Tender Tips and a Freebie: Long cooking over low heat helps tenderize
lean cuts.  Stews are ideal made with chunks of round steak - just
remember to use plenty of liquid and keep the lid on the pot.

Marinating also helps tenderize.  Always include an acid (Vinegar
orlemon juice) in marinade and marinate at least 6 hours.  Grill
quickly, being careful not to overcook.
