Title: Mayan Kings' Chocolate-Chile Dip
Categories: Dips/spread
Yield: 6 servings
8 oz Milk chocolate (Ghiradelli
-is good; just avoid
-paraffin-based products)
1 ts Powdered sugar
1/4 ts Cinnamon
2 ts Finely-ground Chimayo red
-chile
1/2 ts Vanilla extract (Mexican
-vanilla if available)
1/2 c  Whipping cream
Break chocolate into 1" pieces. Add chocolate and all remaining
ingredients, except whipping cream, in a fondue pot, chaffing dish or
double boiler. While blending over low heat, slowly add whipping
cream as chocolate melts, until mixture is completely smooth. If it
becomes too thick, it can be thinned with the addition of a bit of
warm cream or milk.

Recommended as a dip for Five Spice Tortillas (another recipe in the
book) as well as for fresh strawberries, pineapple, bananas, pound
cake and ladyfingers and can be served over crepes stuffed with
poached pears. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-09-95
