Title: Broiled Lemon Caper Swordfish
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
4    Pieces swordfish, cut 1"
-thick (6-8 oz ea)
4 tb Olive oil
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
1    Garlic clove, pressed
1 1/2 tb Drained tiny capers
1/2 ts Finely grated lemon zest
1 tb Chopped parsley
The greatest danger when cooking swordfish is drying it out. A light
brush with oil is a nice way to retain moisture. Once the fish is out
from the broiler, it will cook for a minute or two, so bear this in
mind when testing it.

1. Preheat the broiler. Brush the fish lightly on both sides with 1
tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

2. Place the fish on a small wire rack set inside an ovenproof dish.
Broil 4" from heat source for 4 minutes. Carefully turn the fish over
and cook another 4 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, combine the remaining oil, lemon juice, garlic, capers
and lemon zest in a small saucepan. Place over low heat and cook,
swirling the pan, for 2-3 minutes to heat through. Stir in the
parsley. Place the swordfish on dinner plates and spoon the sauce on
top. Serve immediately.
