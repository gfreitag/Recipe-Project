Recipe by: Fifty Two Meat Loaves Preparation Time: 0:15 Preheat oven
at 350.  Prepare a loaf pan or muffin tins with cooking spray and
flour. In a large skillet, warm oil over medium heat.  Add onions,
garlic, oregano and cayenne, cover and cook, stirring once or twice,
for 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and 1 teaspoon of the salt, raise the
heat to medium-high and cook uncovered, tossing and stirring the
mushrooms often, until they render their juices and are tender, about
10 minutes.  Stir in 1/2 cup of ketchup, remove from heat and cool to
room temperature. Position a rack in the middle of the oven.  In a
mixing bowl, combine the turkey, mushroom mixture, egg whites, bread
crumbs, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and black pepper and mix
thoroughly.  Add the cubes of mozzarella and mix until evenly
distributed.  Transfer the meat mixture to a shallow baking dish and
shape it into a flat loaf about 2 1/2" thick.  Smooth the top of the
loaf or muffin tins with the back of a spoon.  Spread the remaining
1/2 cup pizza sauce evenly over the loaf.  Lay pepperoni slices
evenly over the sauce, overlapping them if necessary and using them
all. Bake for about 1 1/4 hours, pouring off accumulated pan juices
as necessary. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
