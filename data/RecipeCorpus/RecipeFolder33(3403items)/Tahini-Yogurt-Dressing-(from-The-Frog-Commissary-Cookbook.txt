Title: Tahini-Yogurt Dressing (from The Frog Commissary Cookbook
Categories: Dress/stuff, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
8 oz Plain yogurt
1/3 c  Tahini
3/8 ts Ground cumin
1/8 ts Ground coriander
1/4 ts Minced garlic
1 tb Lemon juice
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
Whisk the yogurt gradually into the tahini until well combined.  Add
the remaining ingredients and blend well.

The authors of this quite good cookbook suggest that it be used over
sliced ripe avocadoes, garnished with 3/8 cup slivered almonds,
toasted, or try it with a chicken-bacon-avocado salad, as a dip for
crudites, or with a mixed vegetable salad in a pita bread.
