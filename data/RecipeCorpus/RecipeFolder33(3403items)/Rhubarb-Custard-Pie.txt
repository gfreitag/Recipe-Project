Title: Rhubarb Custard Pie
Categories: Pie/tart, Pastry
Yield: 8 servings
2    Pie crust
2    Eggs
1 c  Sugar
2 tb Unsalted butter -- cut &
Softened
1/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Lemon zest -- grated
1 lb Rhubarb -- cut into 1"
Chunks
2    Cloves
1    Egg -- beaten with:
1 ts Water
Roll out one pie crust 1/8" thick on a floured surface, fit it into a
9" pie plate and trim it flush with the surface.  Chill the shell for
at least 30 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 400.  In a bowl with an
electric mixer beat the eggs until they are well combined, add the
sugar, a little at a time, beating, and beat the mixture until it is
light and fluffy. Beat in the butter, flour, nutmeg, cinnamon and
zest.  Arrange the rhubarb in the shell with the cloves and pour the
egg mixture over it.  Roll out the remaining dough 1/8" thick on a
floured surface and drape it over the filling.  Trim the top crust,
leaving a 1/2" overhang, fold it under the bottom crust, pressing the
edge to seal it, and crimp the edge decoratively.  Brush the dough
with the egg wash and cut slits in the top crust with a sharp knife
to form steam vents.  Bake the pie on a baking sheet in the oven for
10 minutes, reduce the oven temp to 350 and bake the pie for 30 to 40
minutes more, or until the crust is golden.  Serve warm or at room
temp.
