* See recipe in this cookbook to make your own Jalapeno Jelly, or you
can use a store-bought one for this recipe. A food processor is not
necessary for the preparation of this recipe, but it will take longer
without.

Fit the steel knife blade into the work bowl of the food processor.
Process onion until chopped in 1/4-inch pieces. Melt margarine in a
medium skillet. Saute onion in skillet until tender. With steel knife
blade still attached, process eggs, jelly and cream cheese until
smooth, about 30 seconds. Pour mixture into skillet with onions and
scramble until eggs are dry.
