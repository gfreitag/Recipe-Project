From George Harrison. Original recipe from "Mary Frampton and Friends
Rock and Roll Recipes." Doubleday, 1980.

Heat a small amount of oil in a frying pan. When oil is good and hot,
add the red chile and cumin seeds. When the seeds stop sputtering,
brown the onions and garlic in seasoned oil.

In a separate deep pan, wash the lentils in plenty of water. When
clean, liberally cover with water. When the onions are browned, add
them to the pan of lentils. Now add the tomatoes, peppers, bay leaf,
salt and pepper. Potatoes and carrots and small boiling onions may be
added for a more substantial meal.

Bring to a boil, cover and turn down to very low heat. The soup is
ready to serve in an hour and tastes even better the next day.
