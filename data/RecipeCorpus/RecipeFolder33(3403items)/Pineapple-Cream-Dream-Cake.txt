1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Sugar
2 1/4 c  Crushed pineapple -- 1 20 oz
Can
1 c  Whipping cream
1 tb Confectioner's sugar

1. Prepare cake mix according to directions. Do not use cake mix with
pudding. Cook in 2 layers. 2. Drain the pineapple well, reserving
juice. 3. For icing, combine flour and sugar in a saucepan. Stir in 1
cup of pineapple juice that has been drained from the crushed
pineapple. Blend and bring this mixture to a boil, stirring
constantly. Boil and stir for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in
crushed, drained pineapple. Allow to cool. 4. Whip the cream until
slightly stiff peaks form. Fold half the cream into cooled pineapple
mixture. To remaining whipped cream add 1 tablespoon confectioner's
sugar and whip only until blended. 5. Spread 1/3 the pineapple mix on
one cake layer. Top with the second layer and spread with remaining
mixture. Use the whipped topping to spread on the sides of cake.
Garnish the top with the kiwi fruit sliced thin. Use the strawberries
whole as a garnish on top or place around side of cake. Chill cake
for at least 6 hours before serving.
