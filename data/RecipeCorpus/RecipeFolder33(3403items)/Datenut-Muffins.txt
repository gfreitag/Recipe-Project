Title: Datenut Muffins
Categories: Muffins, Desserts
Yield: 12 servings
1 1/2 c  Dates
3 c  Hot water (120 degrees)
3/4 c  Margarine
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2 lg Eggs - extra large
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1/3 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Water
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 c  Pecans, coarsely chopped
2 1/2 c  All purpose flour, sifted
Soak the dates in 3 cups hot water for 10 minutes. Drain the water and
refrigerate dates for about 30 minutes; they must be cold before
using. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Cream together margarine and sugar.
Add the eggs, vanilla, salt, 1 1/2 cups water, baking soda, pecans
and flour, mixing as little as possible, until just moist. Fold in
the dates. Place in muffin cups and bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 25
minutes.

Note: Using half the amount of margarine decreases the fat amount by 6
grams per serving and the difference isn't noticed and does not
compromise the flavor.
