FOR TOPPING: Melt butter in heavy 10 inch diameter skillet over
medium-high heat. Sprinkle sugar over and cook until deep golden,
stirring frequently, about 3 minutes. Add apples (caramel will
harden). Cook until apples are just tender and caramel liquefies,
stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle cinnamon over apples.
Continue to cook until apples are very tender and caramel is very
thick, about 1 minute. Rearrange apples evenly over bottom of same
skillet. Cool 15 minutes.

FOR CAKE: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350'F. Sift
first 6 ingredients into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat
butter in large bowl until fluffy. Add both sugars and beat until
well blended. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating after each addition. Beat
in vanilla. Using rubber spatula mix in dry ingredients, then diced
apples. Spoon batter into skillet; smooth top.

Bake until top of cake is deep brown, edges begin to pull away from
sides of skillet and tester inserted into center comes out clean,
about 55 minutes. Cool 5 minutes. Invert large plate over skillet.
Using hot pads as aid, firmly hold plate and skillet together and
turn over, letting cake fall onto plate. Lift skillet off. Transfer
any apple slices left in skillet to top of cake. Serve warm with
whipped cream.
