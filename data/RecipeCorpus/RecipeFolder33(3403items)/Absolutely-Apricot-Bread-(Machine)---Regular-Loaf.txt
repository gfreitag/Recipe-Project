This is bread with the jam alread inside!  It's a coffee bread, a
snack bread or the perfect after-school bread.  The finely textured
sweet bread also happens to be lovely, with the summery orange
apricots floting in the golden loaf.
Success Hints
-------------

Use the "light" crust feature if your machine provides it.

Use dried apricots preserved without sulfur dioxide, which sometimes
deactivates the yeast.

Use a jam with a high fruit content and few other additives.

Use regular, rapid or delayed time bake cycle.
