Place all of the ingredients, except the ribs, in a blender and blend
to a fine sauce.  Marinate the ribs in the sauce for at least 2
hours, longer if time permits.  Sear over high heat on the grill,
then move the ribs to the side of the grill off the fire and cook
slowly for 1 hour or until done. Turn and baste with the sauce
several times while they cook.
