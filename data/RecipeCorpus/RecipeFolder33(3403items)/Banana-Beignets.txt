Yield: 1 servings
3    Bananas, up to ...
4    Bananas (slightly under-
Ripe), cut in 1" thick
Slices
1/2    Lemon, juice of
-sugar
1/4 c  White rum
MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
1 c  Sifted flour
1 pn Salt
2 ts Sugar
1/3 c  Warm beer
-a little water
2 tb Melted sweet butter
-vegetable oil for deep
Frying
2    Egg whites
Place the banana slices in a bowl and sprinkle with lemon juice,
sugar and rum.  Toss lightly.  Cover and marinate for 40 or 50
minutes. Batter: In a bowl combine the flour, salt and sugar.  Add
the beer and incorporate it into the flour.  Do not overbeat, just
blend it in. Add just enough water to give the batter the consistency
of heavy cream. Add the melted butter and let the batter stand for 40
minutes to 1 hour. Heat the oil (to the depth of 3 inches) in a large
skillet.  You do not need a deep fryer. While the oil is getting hot,
beat the egg whites and add them to the batter. Drain the banana
slices and dip them into the batter. Drop 4 to 6 at a time into the
hot fat and fry them until they are nicely browned. Drain the
beignets on paper towels and sprinkle with lots of confectioners'
sugar. Serve immediately. Variation: apple slices can be substituted
for bananas. From "Seasonal Kitchen" by Perla Meyers.
