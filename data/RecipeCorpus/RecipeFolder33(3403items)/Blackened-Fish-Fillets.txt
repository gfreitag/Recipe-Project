Mix dry ingredients on large plate.  Heat olive oil in heavy skillet
(do not use lightweight or non-stick skillet).  Dip each fillet in
egg white (in the 9 x 12 pan) and then dip in the dry ingredients,
patting the fillets by hand. Cook fish on each side for 2 to 3
minutes, being careful when turning them over. The fish will look
charred "blackened" and there may be some smoke, but not an excessive
amount. The blackening forms a spicy, crunchy coating, sealing in
moisture and flavor.
