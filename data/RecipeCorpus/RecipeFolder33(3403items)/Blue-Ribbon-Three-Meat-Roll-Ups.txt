Iowa State Fair cookout champion Gary Kuper of Adel, Iowa (12 miles
west of Des Moines), sent us his prizewinning recipe. Gary rolls
together beef round steak, bacon and ham for an irresistible
marinated trio.

1. For marinade, combine the 1/2 cup cooking oil, vinegar or lemon
juice, 2 cloves garlic and pepper. Place beef steak in a plastic bag;
set into a shallow dish. Pour marinade over meat. Seal bag. Chill
meat for 12 to 24 hours, turning bag occasionally.

2. Meanwhile, prepare sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the 1/4 cup
cooking oil, butter and 2 gloves garlic. Cook over low heat till
butter is melted. Remove from heat; whisk in sour cream. Set the
sauce aside.

3. Drain the meat, discarding the marinade. Cut the beef into strips
that are about 6 inches long by 3/4 inch wide.

4. Using the same number of strips of bacon as there are strips of
beef, cook bacon in a large skillet till bacon is cooked, but not
crisp.

5. Cut ham into 6x3/4-inch strips.

6. For each roll, place a strip of beef atop a bacon strip. Place 1
or 2 strips of ham atop each beef strip. Beginning at short side of
stack, roll up meat. Thread rolls onto skewers, leaving 1/4 inch
between each.

7. In a covered grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan.
Test for medium heat above drip pan. Place kabobs on the grill rack
over the drip pan. Brush with some of the sauce. Lower the grill hood
and grill for 15 to 20 minutes or till meat is of desired doneness,
turning and brushing with sauce once.

Makes 6 to 8 servings.
