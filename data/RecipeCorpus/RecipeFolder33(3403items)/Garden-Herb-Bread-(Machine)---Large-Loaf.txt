[This bread deserves some SERIOUS raves  Electric Bread's description
says most of it, but I like it so much I've used the bread for turkey
stuffing - absolutely outstanding!]

The fragrance of turkey stuffing will fill your home while this
flavorful bread is baking, thanks to all those aromatic dried herbs.
This loaf is excellent for any cold meat sandwich you can drem up -
including turkey and cranberry - and it makes downright tasty
croutons.

Success Hints
-------------

Use dried herbs that are flaked and not ground.  If using ground,
reduce the amount by half.  If using fresh herbs, double the amount.

Any combination of spices may be substituted according to your tastes.

Use regular, rapid bake or timed bake cycle.
