Combine egg with 1/4 cup pineapple syrup. Sprinkle over flour mixture
while tossing and stirring with fork. Add liquid to only the driest
parts, pushing lumps to side, until dough is moist enough to hold
together. 4. Divide dough in half. Form squares and roll out one
portion on floured surface to a 12-inch square. Spread with softened
margarine. Cut into 4 squares; then cut each square diagonally to
make 8 triangles total. Repeat with remaining dough for a total of 16
triangles. 5. Combine brown sugar with 2 tablespoons flour and
nutmeg. Roll pineapple spears in this mixture then place along wide
end of triangle. Roll to the pointed end, tucking in sides. Place on
greased cookie sheets and insert a wooden popsicle stick into each
one. Bake in preheated 375-degree oven for 15-20 minutes until light
golden brown. Cool, then spread with caramel sauce; roll in chopped
nuts or coconuts.

CARAMEL SAUCE: In top of double boiler, combine caramels and
evaporated milk. Heat until caramels melt, stirring occasionally.
Remove from heat and add 1/4 cup margarine and 1 cup sifted powdered
sugar. Beat with wire whisk until smooth.
