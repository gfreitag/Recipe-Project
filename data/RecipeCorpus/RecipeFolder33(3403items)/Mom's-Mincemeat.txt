Title: Mom's Mincemeat
Categories: Can/preserv, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 batch
3 lb Green tomatoes; chopped
3 lb Apples; chopped, unpeeled
3 lb Brown sugar
2 lb Rasins; chopped
1 tb Salt
1 c  Beef suet; chopped
1 c  Vinegar
2 tb Cinnamon
2 ts Cloves
1 ts Nutmeg
1 ea Orange w/peel; chopped
Grind tomatoes, drain well (use coarse knife on blender or grinder).
Measure juice and discard.  Put same amount of water in tomato
mixture and bring to a boil, drain again, measure juice and discard.
Put same amount of water (as juice discarded) and bring to a boil
again. Drain well, add remaining ingredients to and including
vinegar. Cook until mixture is clear.  Add spices and cook until
thick.

Put into jars and seal.  Does not need cold packing.  Do not put
spices in until after mixture cooks clear, then add spices & cook
about 3-4 hours until thick.

Notes:

We couldn't find beef suet, so we substituted fat trimmings from beef.

We packed it hot into jars and processed it in a pressure canner, 10
minutes @ 10 psi pressure.  This is for our altitude at @ 5000 feet,
and should probably be less for lower altitudes.  It worked well for
us this way.
