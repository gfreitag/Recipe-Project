CRANACHAN & SHORTBREAD
======================
-
Cranachan
=========

This is a variation of the traditional Scottish dessert, often served
at Harvest festivals. The secret of the dish is not to sweeten the
cream but to allow the toasted oatmeal to develop a nutty flavour,
making a beautiful contrast with the jam.

Serves 4

INGREDIENTS:

1/2 pint double cream
8   oz   blackcurrant jam
1/2 cup  medium oatmeal
Dash Creme de Cassis (opt)

Melt the jam mixed with creme de cassis over a medium heat, adding
extra whole berries if you like. Toast the oatmeat under a slow grill
making sure the oatmeal doesn't brown - just let the flavour mature.

Add half the toasted oatmeal to the cream and whip to a full
consistancy. Pour the jam into wine glasses and fill with the cream
mixture. Sprinkle the rest of the oatmeal on top. The jam should
still be warm when the dish is served, contrasting with the cream.

Serve with shortbread then sit back and smile smugly at guests'
compliments.

Variations: Any harvest fruit instead of blackcurrant. To accent the
nutty flavour of the toasted oatmeal, add crushed hazelnuts.

"Traditional" Cranachan
=======================

Also known as Caledonian Ice, Iced Stapag and Cream Crowdie.

Serves 4

INGREDIENTS:

double cream
1   pint
2   tablespoons castor sugar
coarse oatmeal
Drambuie or whisky Blackcurrants to taste (opt)
1/2 cup
Dash

Whip the cream, add sugar and whisky. Freeze until edges crystalise.
Toast the oatmeal and mix it through the iced cream mixture, return
to the freezer and freeze until solid. Remove iced cream half an hour
before serving.

If you're using blackcurrants or other berries, serve them fresh with
the iced cream and shortbread.

Shortbread
==========

Shortbread is a commonplace cake in Scotland, often served with
scones and other cakes for afternoon tea.

The usual shape of shortbread is round flat 1/4" - 1/2" thick cakes
with the edges pinched with the finger and thumb to form sunrays - a
tradition which is thought to have arisen from pre-christian
sunworship. It is also baked into 4" x 1/2" x 1/4" fingers.

Shortbread is mandatory at Christmas and Hogmany (New Year's Eve),
when it is served with whisky. However, it should be noted that the
shortbread is not a pre-requisite for the whisky on these occasions...
