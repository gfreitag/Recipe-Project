Risotto al Pomodori Secchi,
-Piselli, e Caprino
The intense taste of the sun-dried tomatoes gives this risotto its
formidable character. Sallie's Notes: Amounts in brackets are for 2
servings, as I make it. My modifications/notes are also in brackets. 5
tablespoons unsalted butter [2 Tbsp] 2 tablespoons pure olive oil [1
Tbsp] 1/2 cup finely chopped onion [1 small shallot] 2 cups uncooked
Italian short-grain rice (Arborio, Vialone, or Carnaroli) [2/3 cup]
1/2 cup dry white wine [1/3 cup] 6 1/2 cups (about) hot chicken broth
[14 1/2 oz can- low salt] 1/2 cup coarsely chopped sun-dried tomatoes
packed in oil [3 halves] 1 cup fresh shelled peas or defrosted frozen
peas [about 1/2 cup] 4 ounces creamy goat cheese, crumbled [about 2
Tbsp] 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese [about 1/4 cup] 1. Place
3 [1] tablespoons of the butter with the oil in a heavy 4-quart
saucepan or casserole over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook,
stirring, for about 3 minutes, until it begins to soften. Add the
rice and stir well, using a wooden spoon, to combine. Add the wine
all at once and cook, stirring, until it is mostly absorbed by the
rice, about a minute or two. [I now add the sun dried tomatoes and
the first addition of broth] 2. Begin to add the broth, about 3/4 cup
at a time, stirring well until each addition of broth has been
absorbed by the rice. Continue to add the broth, stirring, until the
rice is tender but firm, al dente, about 20 minutes. [add about 1/2
cup at a time- I also usually put the peas in the broth so they'll
cook while the rice is cooking. Don't add peas to the rice until the
end, though] 3. Turn off the heat and stir in one last addition of
broth, the remaining butter, the sun-dried tomatoes, peas, goat
cheese, and Parmesan until the cheeses melt and are incorporated into
the rice. Serve immediately. [I save only about 2-3 Tbsp broth to
stir in at the end]
