In a mini food processor or blender, combine the ginger, garlic and 1
tbsp of water and process to a smooth paste.  Combine the ginger and
garlic paste, red pepper powder, tumeric and 1 tbsp of the crushed
black pepper. Rub the mixture into the chicken, cover and marinate
for one hour.  Heat oil over moderate heat in a non-stick saucepan.
Add the cinnamon, cardamom and cloves.  Stir for 30 seconds or until
fragrant.  Add the curry leaves. Stir.  Add the chopped onion and
saute for 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low.  Add 2 tbsp of
water, reduce the heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the
onions are golden brown.  This will take about 20 minutes.  Add the
chopped tomatoes and ginger and garlic paste. Cook, mashing the
tomatoes with a wooden spoon.  Add the green chilies and the chicken
with 1/2 cup of water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 5
minutes.  Add the crushed peppercorns and coriander leaves. Continue
cooking until the chicken is cooked, adding more water if necessary
to prevent sticking.  Add salt to taste.  Let stand for a few minutes
to allow flavors to develop.  Can be prepared 1 to 2 days in advance
or frozen. Reheat gently, adding more water if necessary.  229
