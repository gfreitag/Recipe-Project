Title: Apple-Almond Pastries
Categories: Pastry
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Margarine
1 c  Apples -- sliced thin
3 tb Sugar
2 tb Almonds -- sliced
3 tb Apricot preserves -- or
Peach
1. Sift the 1-1/3 cup flour with the salt into a large mixing bowl.
Cut in the solid margarine or butter with pastry blender until
mixture is the size of small peas.

2. Sprinkle 4-5 tablespoons water, a little at a time, over the flour
while stirring with a fork, until mixture is just moist enough to hold
together.

3. Form into a square and flatten to 1/2 inch. Roll out on floured
surface to 12 inch square. Place on ungreased cookie sheet.

4. Toss sliced apples with 1 tablespoon of flour. Place slices down
center third of dough. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar over apples.

5. Fold up about 1/2 inch at each end. Fold sides over apples,
leaving an inch of apples showing down center. Sprinkle with 1
tablespoon sugar and sliced almonds.

6. Bake in preheated 450-degree oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden
brown.

7. Spread immediately with preserves. If preferred, omit the
preserves and frost with a thin glaze made of powdered sugar thinned
with milk and vanilla or orange extract.
