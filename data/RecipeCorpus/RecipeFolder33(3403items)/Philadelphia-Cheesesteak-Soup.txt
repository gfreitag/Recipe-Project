Here's a spin off of the popular Philadelphia cheesesteak sandwich.
If you like, stir in some slice hot Italian peppers, that's how many
Philadelphians enjoy their cheesesteaks.

Cut each steak into 1/2 inch strips.  In saucepan, over medium heat,
cook onions and green peppers in the margarine until crisp tender.
Add the steak strips and continue sauteing until beef changes color,
stirring often.  Stir in soup until smooth.  Gradually stir in the
water and worcestershire and heat through.  Serve topped with toasted
bread cubes. Makes 3 cups or 2 servings.
