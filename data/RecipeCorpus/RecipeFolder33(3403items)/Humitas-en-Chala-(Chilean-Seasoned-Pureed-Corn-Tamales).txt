1/2 c  Milk

Puree the corn kernels with the milk in a food processor.  Add the
salt, pepper, and chile powder and mix well.  In a large frying pan,
heat the margarine, and saute the onion, squash, red bell pepper, and
cilantro for 10 minutes.  Add the pureed corn and cook, stirring
continuously until it thickens, about 5 minutes.  Add the grated
cheese, mix well, and remove from heat.
Blanch the banana leaves or corn husks in boiling water and drain.
One at a time, remove each husk and spread about 4 tablespoons of the
corn mixture in the center of each husk.  Fold the husk around the
corn mixture to make a square packet, and tie securely with kitchen
string. Make sure that all edges are sealed, and that no batter can
escape from the husk. When all of the husks are filled, place them in
a large pot of salted water to cover, and simmer on low heat,
covered, for about 1 hour. Serve in their husks, warm.  They can also
be steamed.
