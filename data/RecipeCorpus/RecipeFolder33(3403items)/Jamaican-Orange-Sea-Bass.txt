-(more or less to taste)
3    Clove Garlic, minced or
-pressed
3    Green onions, minced
1/4 c  Orange juice, freshly

1 tb Vegetable oil

Description:

Based on the classic jerk seasoning, this marinade adds distinctive
flavor from orange zest to balance with the zesty spice from fresh
chile. Ground allspice can be used in place of the freshly ground
whole berries, but the flavor will not be as pronounced.

Along with the Island Black Bean and Rice Salad, sliced fresh mangoes
with a squeeze of lime juice would be ideal with this zesty grilled
fish.

Instructions:

Finely crush the allspice berries with a mortar and pestle, or grind
them with a spice grinder.  In a small bowl, combine allspice with
the jalapeno chili, garlic, onions, orange zest, oil, salt and
pepper. Stir to mix well. Preheat the grill.

Set the sea bas fillets in a shallow dish and lightly spoon the
marinade mixture over.  Turn the fillets so they are evenly coated in
the marinade and set aside 10 to 15 minutes (chill if the ambient
temperature is quite warm).

Put the fish fillets on the hot grill, with the oranges slices
alongside. Cook until the fish is just opaque through. 3 to 4 minutes
per side. Turn the orange slices occasionally, so they brown evenly.

Serve the grilled sea bass with a grilled orange slice and the Island
Black Bean and Rice Salad alongside.
