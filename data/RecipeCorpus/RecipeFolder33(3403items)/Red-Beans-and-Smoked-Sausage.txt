Title: Red Beans and Smoked Sausage
Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Smoked sausage (regular or
-Polish-type)
1 lb Dry red kidney beans
8 c  Water
1 tb Cooking oil
1 lg Onion, chopped coarse
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
Saute onions in oil for 1 minute in large stewing kettle. Add the 8
cups water and the washed beans and cook over low heat for about an
hour or until the beans begin to get soft. Remove 2 or 3 tablespoons
beans and mash, then return them to pot and stir. Continue cooking
until bean gravy becomes milky and thickened. Cut sausage into 1 1/2
inch pieces and add to beans and continue to cook, covered, for 15
minutes, then add 1 level tsp. salt and however much pepper you can
stand---remember there is usually some pepper in the sausage. Never
fry or boil the sausage before adding to beans. Serve over rice.
Serves 4, but to increase to 6, just add more sausage. Never freeze!

Leftover ham, or ham hocks may be substituted, but must be cooked
along with the beans.
