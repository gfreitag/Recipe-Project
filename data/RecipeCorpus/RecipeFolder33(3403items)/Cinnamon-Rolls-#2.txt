In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in lukewarm water.  Blend in eggs and
oil or margarine.  Add 5 cups of hot roll mix.  Stir well.  Add
additional hot roll mix to make a soft, but not too sticky dough.
Knead about 5 minutes until dough is smooth.  Lighly butter bowl. Put
dough in bowl and turn to butter top.  Cover dough with a damp towel
and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Generously grease 2 baking sheets. Prepare cinnamon sprinkle. Punch
down dough. Let stand 10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll
out dough to a 12 x 24 rectangle, about 1/4" thick. Spread generously
with cinnamon sprinkle. Roll dough like a jelly roll and cut with a
sharp knife into 24 1" slices. Place on prepared baking sheets. Cover
with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk,
about 30 to 60 minutes. Preheat oven to 375. Bake 20 to 25 minutes,
until golden brown.  Prepare sweet glaze and brush on while rolls are
still warm. Submitted By MICHELLE HOWE   On   07-27-95
