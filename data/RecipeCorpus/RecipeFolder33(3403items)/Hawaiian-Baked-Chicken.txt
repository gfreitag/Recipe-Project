Title: Hawaiian Baked Chicken
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 8 servings
4 lb Chicken -- *see note
1    Yellow onions -- chopped
3 tb Margarine
3/4 c  Ketchup
1/3 c  Cider vinegar
3 tb Packed brown sugar
1/4 c  Pineapple juice
1/2 c  Pineapple chunks in juice
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
2 ts Mustard
1/8 ts Black pepper
1/2 c  Dried apricots -- minced
1/2 c  Water
* Use whole chickens that you cut into pieces or use breast only. If
using breast only you may need to shorten cooking time by a few
minutes.

1. In large heavy skillet, heat a small amount of oil and brown
chicken on all sides. Drain and place in a 13 x 9 x 2-inch pan. 2. In
a saucepan, melt the margarine and saute the onions until soft and
translucent. Combine the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.
Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour this mixture over
the chicken. 3. Bake in 350-degree oven for about 1 hour, basting
occasionally. Cover loosely with foil if necessary while cooking the
last 30 minutes. Serve this with any juices in pan.
