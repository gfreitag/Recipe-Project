From "Big Flavors of the Hot Sun" (William Morrow, $27.50) by Chris
Schlesinger and John Willoughby. Swordfish is an outstanding fish for
grilling, right up there with tuna. The meat is firm and steak-like,
its relatively high oil content keeps it moist and its flavor is mild
but distinctive.

Rub the swordfish lightly with vegetable oil, sprinkle liberally with
salt and pepper and grill over a medium fire for 4-5 minutes per
side, turning once, until almost completely opaque. Remove from the
grill and serve, accompanied by the relish (recipe follows).
