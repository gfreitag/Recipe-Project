Title: Frozen Fruit Bars
Categories: Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
2/3 c  Graham cracker crumbs
10    Gingersnap cookies
2 1/2 tb Margarine -- melted
1/2 c  Nonfat dry milk
1/2 c  Orange juice
1    Egg white
1 tb Lemon juice
1/4 c  Sugar
8 oz Crushed pineapple --
Drained
1. Place the canned pineapple into a sieve over a bowl to drain
thoroughly. 2. In a small bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and
melted margarine; blend well. Press the mixture firmly into an 8-inch
square freezer safe dish. 3. In a separate bowl, combine the milk
powder, orange juice, lemon juice and egg white. Using a mixer, beat
at high speed for about 3 minutes. Add the sugar and continue beating
for 3 minutes more. Gently fold in the drained pineapple. 4. Spoon
the mixture into the graham cracker crust. Sprinkle the gingersnap
crumbs in a decorative pattern; a circle looks especially festive.
Cover with foil or plastic wrap; freeze for at least 8 hours. 5. Let
stand a few minutes before cutting into serving size portions. Good
to make ahead for a cool summer treat. If desired, decorate the top
with bits of candied fruit in a decorative pattern, pressing down
slightly, then sprinkle the gingersnap crumbs along the outer edge in
a circle before freezing.
