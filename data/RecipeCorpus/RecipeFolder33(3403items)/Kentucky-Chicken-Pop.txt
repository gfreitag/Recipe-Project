Kentucky Chicken Pop
====================
Preparation Time: 1 hour
Baking Time: 1 - 1 1/2
Hours
-Serves: 6
5 cup pumpkin seeds 1 cup freshly popped Kentucky Poppers Microwave
Popcorn, either flavor 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds 1/2 teaspoon ground
coriander 1-1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder 1 large garlic clove 2
medium-sized tomatoes, coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons tomato paste
1-2 cans chicken broth 6-8 pieces of chicken (2 whole, boneless
breasts, divided, and 4 thighs make a nice presentation), skinned X
salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 2-3 tablespoons peanut oil

Place pumpkin seeds, popcorn, cumin seeds, coriander, chili powder and
garlic in blender or food processor; process several seconds or until
pasty. Add tomatoes, tomato paste and process 10 seconds. Slowly add
chicken broth ** until mixture resembles a smooth, heavy, but not
pasty, sauce. Set aside. In a large, heavy skillet or Dutch oven,
heat oil over medium-high heat and brown chicken pieces. Drain on
paper towels and place in a greased, shallow baking pan (11"x7"x2")
in a single layer. Pour sauce over all, cover with tin foil and bake
in a 350 oven 1 hour or until chicken is very tender.* Pumpkin seeds
come already roasted and salted or just plain. Use either, but
remember to adjust salt.

** Use only as much chicken broth as needed
