1 c  All-purpose flour

1/3 c  Bacon fat -- or shortening
1. Fry bacon until crisp; break into large pieces.

vegetable shortening instead.

3. Brown ground beef in large skillet, drain well. Stir in corn, green
pepper, onion, corn meal, oregano, chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt,
pepper, tomato sauce and half the mild green chiles. Keep warm while
preparing pie crust.

4. CRUST: Combine 1 cup flour and 2 tablespoons cornmeal. Cut in bacon
drippings with two knives or pastry blender until mixture is the size
of small peas. Sprinkle 3-4 tablespoons water over mixture; stir with
fork until dough holds together. Form into a ball and flatten to 1/2
inch thick. Keep edges smooth. Roll out on a floured surface to a
diameter 1-1/2 inch larger than inverted 9-inch pie plate. Fit into
pie plate and fold edges to form a rim, then flute edges.

5. Place the ground beef mixture into pie crust. Bake in preheated
425-degree oven for 25 minutes.

6. Combine egg, milk, 1/2 teaspoon salt, dry mustard, Worcestershire
sauce, half the sliced olives, 2 tablespoons mild green chiles and
shredded cheese. Spread on top of beef mixture. Top with bacon and
remaining olives. Bake for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted and
bubbly. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.
