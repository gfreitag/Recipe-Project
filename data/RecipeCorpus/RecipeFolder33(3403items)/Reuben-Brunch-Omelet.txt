Title: Reuben Brunch Omelet
Categories: Breakfast, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 4 servings
8 lg Eggs
1 ts Caraway seed
1 c  Sauerkraut -- drained
4 tb Margarine
8    Swiss cheese slices -- thin
3/4 lb Corned beef brisket --
Sliced thin
4 tb Thousand island salad
Dressing
5    Gherkins
* Omelets will be prepared one at a time in omelet or similar pan, so
it is a good idea to have oven barely warm to keep prepared omelets
in while preparing others.

Have corned beef sliced into thin slices, about 12 pieces if possible.
Drain sauerkraut through strainer over bowl until very well drained.
Discard liquid. Mince one gherkin and add to the thousand island
dressing. 1. Break eggs into bowl, add 1/2 cup water and caraway
seeds (unless sauerkraut already has caraway in it). Beat eggs until
thoroughly blended. 2. Place omelet pan over medium heat. When hot,
add 1 tablespoon solid margarine to pan and tilt to coat sides and
bottom. Turn heat to medium-high. Pour in one quarter of eggs. Using
wide spatula or fork, pull cooked eggs toward center, allowing
uncooked part to flow to outside. While top is still moist and
creamy, add 2 slices Swiss cheese to one side of omelet, top with 1/4
of the corned beef and then top with 1/4 cup sauerkraut. Fold other
side over and immediately remove to serving plate. Keep in barely
warm oven while preparing remaining 3 omelets. Wipe pan with paper
towels between each omelet.

To serve, top each with 1/4 of the dressing and serve one gherkin
along side omelet.
