2 3/4 c  Bread flour
1    Envelope quick-rising yeast
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Celery seeds
1 c  Plus 2 T  (about) hot water
-(125F to 130F)

2 tb Sugar

Combine bread flour, 1 envelope yeast, 1 t salt, 1 t sugar and celery
seeds in food processor and blend. With machine running, gradually
pour hot water through feed tube, adding enough water to form smooth
elastic dough. Process 1 minute to knead. Grease medium bowl. Add
dough to bowl, turning to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then
towel; let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in
volume, about 35 minutes.

Flour baking sheet. Punch dough down and knead on lightly floured
sur- face until smooth. Divide into 8 pieces, Form each dough piece
into ball. Place dough balls on prepared sheet, flattening each
slightly. Using serrated knife, cut X in top center of each dough
ball. Cover with towel and let dough bails rise until almost doubled
in volume, about 20 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375'F. Grease another baking sheet and sprinkle with
cornmeal. Bring 8 C water to boll in large saucepan. Add baking soda
and 2 T sugar (water will foam up). Add 4 rolls and cook 30 seconds
per side. Using slotted spoon, transfer rolls to prepared sheet,
arranging X side up. Repeat with remaining rolls.

Brush rolls with egg white glaze. Sprinkle rolls generously with
coarse salt. Bake rolls until brown, about 25 minutes. Transfer to
racks and cool 10 minutes. Serve rolls warm or at room temperature.
(Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm
