Title: Beef-Cheese Stuffed Tomatoes
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
6    Tomatoes
1/2 lb Ground beef -- * see note
1/2 c  Onions -- chopped
1/2 c  Green peppers -- diced
1/4 c  Dark corn syrup
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1 ts Basil -- or 2 tsp fresh
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
1 c  Bread stuffing cubes,
Seasoned
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
3/4 c  Mozzarella cheese, part skim
Milk -- shredded
* Omit ground beef for a meatless dish, or substitute part ground
beef, part mild Italian sausage. For best taste, try to get
vine-ripened tomatoes.

1. Cut slice off top of tomato and scoop out pulp. Use a melon baller
or grapefruit spoon for ease of removing pulp. Chop pulp and tops
then drain and set aside.

2. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium heat and brown beef, onion
and green peppers, about 5-7 minutes. Drain off excess fat that
accumulates.

3. Add chopped tomato tops and pulp, corn syrup, Worcestershire sauce,
basil, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for 10 minutes until thick and
bubbling. Remove from heat, add stuffing mix and Parmesan cheese.

4. Spoon carefully into tomato shells. Place tomatoes into an 11 x 7 x
2-inch pan or baking dish that will hold all tomatoes without
crowding. Top each tomato with 2 tablespoons mozzarella cheese.

5. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for 25-30 minutes or until heated
thoroughly.
