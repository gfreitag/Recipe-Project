Saute about 2 minutes and stir in chicken stock, herbs, andouille and

to high and add red peppers, stirring continually until peppers are a
little charred. Stir in dried tomatoes and reduce heat to medium. Add
heavy cream, stirring occasionally. When cream boils, reduce to low,
and leave on heat until shrimp is ready.

In a separate saute pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat and
stir in shrimp. Add sherry and saute until shrimp are opaque, about
3-5 minutes.

Pour cream sauce into shrimp and stir. Serve over pasta and garnish
with fresh tomatoes.
