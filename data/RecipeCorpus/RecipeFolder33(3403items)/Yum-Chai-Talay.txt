(Thai Hot and Sour Seafood Salad) Pound cilantro roots, garlic and
chilies in a mortar or blender coarsely. Add sugar, lime juice, salt
and blend well, set aside. Bring a pot of water to a boil over high
heat. Put squids in a strainer, lower the strainer into the water and
boil briefly just until the squids are cooked (DO NOT overcook). Lift
the strainer up and drain well. Pour the squids into a mixing bowl
and set aside. Bring the water to a boil again and repeat the boiling
steps with the fish fillets and mussels. Com- bine the squids, fish,
mussels and the dressing well. Add mints and celery leaves and mix
briefly. Serve immediately, alone or with cooked rice (goes well with
alcoholic beverages).
