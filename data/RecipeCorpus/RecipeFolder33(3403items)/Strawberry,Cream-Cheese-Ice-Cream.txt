This taste sensation from Len Harms of Goshen, Indiana, resulted from
his wife's kitchen disaster. Loanne's strawberry jam didn't gel one
year, and Len used up the surplus spoonable jam in this heavenly ice
cream. It won first place at the Elkhart County Fair.

1. In a heavy medium-size saucepan, combine eggs, sugar and
half-and-half. Cook and stir over medium heat for about 12 minutes
till thickened and bubbly. Cover and chill mixture for 1 hour.

2. Beat the cream cheese till it's smooth. Gradually beat in the
cooled egg-sugar mixture.

3. Stir in the lemon juice and vanilla Stir in the whipping cream.

4. Freeze in a 4- or 5-quart ice cream freezer according to the
manufacturer's directions. When mixture is frozen, remove the dasher
and stir in the strawberry ice cream topping with a long-handled
spoon till marbled, but not thoroughly mixed.

Makes about 3 quarts.
