Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
4    Loin Pork Chops
4 tb Dijon Mustard
4 tb Dark Molasses
4 tb Bourbon
1/4 ts Tabasco Sauce
1/4 ts Orange Rind, Grated
1/2 lb Yams, Peeled & Sliced
1/3 c  Lime Juice
2 tb Shallots, Minced
1 tb Parsley, minced
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper, cracked
1/2 c  Peanut oil
1    Head chicory,
Chunked small
Red cabbage, shredded
1    Tart apple, cored
Start the barbecue, it will be ready when all the coals are evenly
covered with a thick layer of gray ash. The pork chops should be cut
1" thick. Cut the tart apple into wedges. The chicory chunks should
be cut into bite sized chunks. Place the pork chops in a large dish.
Combine 1/2 the mustard, 1/2 the molasses, 1/2 the bourbon, 1/2 the
Tabasco and the orange rind. Mix well. Add the yams to the chops.
Pour the mustard mixture over the yams and chops. Marinate at room
temperature for at least 30 minutes. Remove the meat and yams from
the marinade, scraping most of it off. Grill, covered, six minutes
per side for the meat, eight minutes per side on the yams, turning
once, until cooked through. Pork should be white but moist when cut.
Yams should be browned and soft. Whisk the remaining mustard,
molasses, bourbon and hot sauce with the lime juice, shallots,
parsley, salt and pepper. Whisk in the oil to make a dressing.
Arrange the chicory chunks, shredded cabbage and apple wedges on a
platter. Drizzle with dressing. Serve. From: Joel Ehrlich
