Title: Orange Tea Mix
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 servings

1/2 c  Lemonade powder
1/2 ts Ground cloves

Combine all ingredients in a food processor using the steel knife

this in small batches by hand or in the blender, but not as
effectively.

Directions for use: Stir 2 heaping teaspoons into one cup of hot
water. To make iced tea, let cool, then serve over ice.
