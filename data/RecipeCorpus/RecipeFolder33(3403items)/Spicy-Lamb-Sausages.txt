Title: Spicy Lamb Sausages
Categories: Meats, Sausage, Hot/spicy
Yield: 15 servings
3 lb Lamb leg meat, fat included
2 c  Full-bodied red wine
1/2 c  Sliced onion
2    Bay leaves
2    Garlic cloves
2 tb Fresh rosemary
2    Chipotle peppers
1 1/2 tb Kosher salt
1/2 tb Fresh ground pepper
1/2 ts Juniper berries
Cut meat into 1" cubes. The raio of meat to fat should be
approximately 2 to 1. If it isn't, add back fat until the proper
ratio is reached.

Combine all ingredients in a glass bowl and marinate for 48 hours in
refrigerator. Remove bay leaves and put all ingredients through meat
grinder with large-hole disk. Mix well and cook a small amount of the
sausage mixture to check seasonings. Correct seasonings. Form into
patties or use hog-casing to form links. Before serving, grill or fry
until cooked through. Serve hot or at room temperature, with fruited
mustard.

NOTE: Chipotle peppers are smoked jalapenos; they're available at
gourmet shops and specialty stores canned or dried.
