Yield: 4 servings
4 oz Flour: self-rising
2 oz White breadcrumbs
3 oz Suet; shredded
2 oz Sultanas
2 oz Currants
2 oz Brown sugar; soft
1 tb Golden syrup
1/2 oz Mixed spices
1    Egg; slightly beaten
4 oz Milk
Grease a 3 pint pudding basin.  Mix all the dry ingredients in a large
bowl.  Stir in the egg, syrup and milk to make a soft consistency.
Fill the basin with the mixture, leaving plenty of room for the
pudding to swell. Cover with a layer of greaseproof paper buttered on
both sides and cover and seal with kitchen foil.  Place on a

warm syrup and whipped cream. Serves 4.
