1 c  Sugar, brown
1/2 c  Sugar, white
1/2 c  Butter; softened
1/2 c  Shortening
2    Eggs
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
2 1/2 c  Flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
12 oz Semi-sweet chocolate pieces
1 c  Walnuts or pecans; chopped
GUIDANCE:

After procurement actions, decontainerize inputs.  Perform measurement
tasks on a case-by-case basis.  In a mixing type bowl, impact heavily
on brown sugar, granulated sugar, softened butter and shortening.
Coordi- nate the interface of eggs and vanilla, avoiding an overrun
scenario to the best of your skills and abilities.

At this point in time, leverage flour, baking soda and salt into a
bowl and aggregate.  Equalize with prior mixture and develop intense
and continuous liasion among inputs until well-coordinated. Associate
key chocolate and nut subsyststems and execute stirring operations.

Within this time frame, take action to prepare the heating
environment for throughput by manually setting the oven baking unit
by hand to a temperature or 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees
Celsius). Drop mixture in an ongoing fashion from a teaspoon onto an
ungreased cookie sheet at intervals sufficient enough apart to permit
total and permanent separation of throughputs to the maximum extent
practicable under operating conditions.

Position cookie sheet in a bake situation and surveil for 8 to 10
minutes. Initiate coordination of outputs within the cooling rack
function. Containerize, wrap in red tape and disseminate to
authorized staff personnel on a timely and expeditious basis.

Total Lead Time: 35 minutes.

OUTPUT:

Six dozen official government chocolate-chip cookie units.
