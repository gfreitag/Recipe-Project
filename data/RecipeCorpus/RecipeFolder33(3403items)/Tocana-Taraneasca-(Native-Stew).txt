1 x  Recipe
Native stew is whatever meat you have on hand, beef, pork, lamb,
veal or venison but must be lean cuts. Melt a couple tablespoons of
fat or bacon grease in a skillet and fry chopped onions until golden
brown. Dredge meat

chunks in seasoned flour and add to skillet and cook stirring
constantly until meat is browned. Add a couple of chopped ripe
tomatoes and simmer slowly for 20 min or more, add diced boiled
potatoes, adjust seasoning adding paprika and simmer till done. Serve
hot topped with sour cream and minced fresh parsley.
Most of the time the meats are cubed and thrown into a pot of ice
cold water, washed once or twice and let stand in the same. May be
thickened with a roux, as soaking meat adds water to recipe, but
makes nice gravy. Submitted By MARK MIKLAS   On   07-28-95
