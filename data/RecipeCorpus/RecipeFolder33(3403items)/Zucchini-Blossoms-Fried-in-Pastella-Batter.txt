Title: Zucchini Blossoms Fried in Pastella Batter
Categories: Side dish
Yield: 4 servings
14    Zucchini blossoms
Vegetable oil, enough to
-come 3/4" up the side of
-the skillet (about 1 1/2
-cups)
1 c  Water
2/3 c  All-purpose flour
Salt to taste
Make the batter: Put 1 cup of the water in a soup plate and gradually
add the flour, sifting it through a sieve and constantly beating the
mixture with a fork until all the flour has been added. The batter
should have the consistency of sour cream.

Wash the blossoms rapidly under cold running water and dry them
gently on paper towels. Cut the base of the blossom on one side, and
open the flower flat, without dividing it.

Heat the oil over high heat. When it is very hot, dip the blossoms
quickly in and out of the batter and slip them into the skillet. When
they are golden brown on one side, turn them and cook them to golden
brown on the other side. Transfer to paper towels to drain, sprinkle
with salt, and serve promptly while still hot.
