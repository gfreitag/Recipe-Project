Preheat oven at 400 or toaster oven works fine.  With a sharp knife,
slice bagel into very thin slices so that you can almost see through
them (you'll get about 10 slices). Place slices on a baking sheet.
Lightly spray with cooking spray.  Quickly sprinkle in a small amount
of seasoning (a little goes a long way) or leave plain.  Bake for 3
to 4 minutes until lightly browned-be careful; they burn easily.
Break each slice into 4 chips. Store in an airtight container for up
to 3 days.
