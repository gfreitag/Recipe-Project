Title: Tomato-Basil Soup
Categories: Appetizers, Soup/stew, Vegetables, Tomatoes
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Tomatoes, diced
2 ea Garlic cloves, coarsely
-- chopped
2 tb Olive oil
1/4 c  Dry red wine
5 c  Vegetable stock
1 cn Tomato paste, optional
2 bn Basil, coarsely chopped
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
The tomatoes need to be diced into bite-sized pieces.  Set aside.

Heat olive oil until it is warmed.  Add the garlic & saute it very
gently only until it becomes fragrant.  Add the tomatoes, stir once &
add the remaining ingredients except the basil & salt & pepper. Raise
the heat a little, cover & let the soup cook gently without ever
letting it quite come to the boil.  Let it cook like this for 45
minutes. You want the tomatoes to be softened.  Add the seasonings &
the basil. Cook long enough to warm the basil through.  Serve with
freshly baked, crusty, Italian bread.

MARK'S NOTE: If you want a thin soup, omit the tomato paste.  If you
want it to be thicker, add the paste, but it will make quite a
difference to the texture of the soup.  If serving as a lunch, or
with only a light main course, then the paste makes this a rich &
satisfying soup: if serving purely as an appetizer, then omit the
tomato paste.

Also, do not let the soup come to a full rolling boil.  It is best
served warmed.  Once you add the basil, you may want to switch the
heat off & let the soup sit for a while, reheating just before
serving.
