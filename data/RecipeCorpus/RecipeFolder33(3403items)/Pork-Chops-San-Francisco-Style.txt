Title: Pork Chops San Francisco Style
Categories: Meats
Yield: 4 servings
4    3/4" Pork Chops
1 ts Peanut Oil
1 cl Garlic, Minced
The Sauce:
2 ts Safflower Oil
4 tb Sherry
4 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Brown sugar
1/4 ts Red pepper, crushed
2 ts Cornstarch
2 tb Water
Trim the pork chops of all fat. Heat the oil in a skillet and brown
the chops on both sides. Remove the meat from the skillet. Add more
oil if needed. Saute the garlic for 1 minute - careful, don't burn
it. Combine the oil, sherry, soy sauce, brown sugar and red pepper.
Place the chops in the skillet. Pour the sauce over the pork chops.
Cover the skillet tightly. Simmer over low heat until the chops are
tender and cooked through (30-35 minutes). Add water (1-2
Tablespoons) if needed to keep the sauce from cooking down too much.
Turn the chops once during the cooking. Remove the chops to the
serving platter. Dissolve the cornstarch in water. Add to the sauce,
stirring, and cook until the sauce thickens. Pour the sauce over the
chops and serve on a bed of noodles. From:    Joel Ehrlich Submitted
