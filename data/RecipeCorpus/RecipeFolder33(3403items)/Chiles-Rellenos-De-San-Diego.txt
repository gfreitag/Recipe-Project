Title: Chiles Rellenos De San Diego
Categories: Tex/mexican, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 6 servings
1 pk Taco seasoning mix
16 oz Tomatoes
7 oz Green chiles -- canned
1/4 lb Monterey jack cheese -- *see
Note
Salt -- optional
1/4 c  Flour
2    Eggs
1/4 ts Cream of tartar
1 c  Canola oil
*Cut the cheese into 6 strips.

1. For the spicy tomato sauce which goes on top, combine the taco
seasoning mix and tomatoes in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce
heat and simmer for 15 minutes. 2. If fresh chiles are used, cut off
the stem ends and rinse with cold water to remove seeds. Broil the
chiles until the skin browns and blisters. Peel the chiles
immediately, while they are still warm. If canned chiles are used,
gently rinse with cold water to remove seeds; pat dry. Stuff each
chile with a strip of cheese. 3. Combine the flour and salt. 4.
Separate the eggs. Beat yolks until lemon yellow and slightly
thickened. Beat the whites until they are foamy. Add the cream of
tartar and continue beating until the whites hold a stiff peak.
Carefully fold yolks into whites. 5. Heat the oil in a skillet. 6.
Roll the stuffed chiles in the flour. Dip into egg batter. Fry in hot
oil on each side until golden. Drain and serve with spicy tomato
sauce.

Yield: 6 rellenos.
