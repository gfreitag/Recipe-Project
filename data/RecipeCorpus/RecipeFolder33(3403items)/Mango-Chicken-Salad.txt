Categories: Salads
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Cooked chicken (see note)
1    Mango
1 cn Plain yogurt or sour cream
-(8 oz)
1 tb Minced fresh ginger
1    Garlic clove, peeled and
-minced (opt)
1    Red bell pepper, cored and
-minced

Pepper to taste

Cook the chicken as desired. (Leftover chicken from the grill is the
most delicious in this salad, but you can also cook the chicken in
water or in the microwave.) Set aside to cool. When chicken is cool
enough to handle, skin and cut into 1/2" chunks. Put in a bowl.

Peel the mango, cut it into small pieces, about a 1/2", and add it to
the bowl along with remaining ingredients. Stir gently until well
combined.

Serve on top of lettuce.

Curried mango chicken salad variation: Season the mixture with 1
teaspoon curry powder and a little ground hot pepper, if desired.

NOTE: To cook chicken in a microwave, place breast halves (or
equivalent weight) on a plate and cover with waxed paper. Microwave
on high power for 8-9 minutes, rearranging twice during cooking.

If you don't own a microwave, heat 1/2" of water in the bottom of a
12" skillet. Place chicken pieces in water and return to the boil.
Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer the meat 10 minutes (longer for
dark meat) or until only the faintest hint of pink ramains in the
meat. (Cut into it to see; you'll be cutting it into pieces later
anyway.) Turn the meat over halfway through cooking. Cool and chop as
required. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-07-95
