Title: Churros De Platano (Fried Plantains)
Categories: Fruit, Tex/mexican
Yield: 6 servings
3    Plantains -- peeled, * see
Note
Lemon juice
4    Eggs
1/4 c  Flour
1/2 ts Salt
Oil -- ** see note
* If plantains (fat, red-skinned cooking bananas) are not available,
use large, green-tipped bananas. DO NOT use overripe bananas. ** For
frying, use part olive oil, part Canola oil.

Peel and split the bananas lengthwise. Cut each piece in half and dip
in lemon juice. To make batter, beat the egg yolks until thick and
light. Add flour and salt. Beat egg whites until stiff, not dry, and
fold into yolks. Drop the drained bananas pieces into the batter, one
at a time. Pick up with slotted spoon and slide gently into hot oil
in heavy skillet (oil about 1 inch deep). Cook over medium heat,
turning almost immediately. Cook until browned on both sides. Drain
on paper toweling.
