3 tb Honey
3 tb Orange juice -- or lime
Juice
1/2 c  Light whipping cream
* Use berries of your choice. Some good ones to use in this salad are
strawberries, raspberries, blackberries.

1. Prepare fruit by peeling oranges and grapefruits, then slice into
thin slices, removing all white pith. Arrange decoratively on a large
platter, leaving center free for dressing container. 2. Scatter green
and red grapes on oranges and grapefruit. Place berries, a few in
each group, around edges of salad. Tuck in slices of avocado here and
there. Kiwi fruit can be used here for a colorful and delicious
addition.

DRESSING: Chill bowl and beaters, then whip chilled cream until it
piles softly. Blend honey and orange juice or lime juice. Beat the
two mixtures together, only enough to combine well.

Pour dressing into a serving container and set in middle of fruit
platter, or serve on the side.
