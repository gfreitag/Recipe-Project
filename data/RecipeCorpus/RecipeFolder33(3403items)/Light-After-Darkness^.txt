Light after darkness, Gain after loss, Strength after suffering, Crown
after cross, Sweet after bitter, Song after sigh, Home after
wandering, Praise after cry. Sheaves after sowing, Sun after rain.
Sight after mystery, Peace after pain. Joy after sorrow, Calm after
blast. Rest after weariness, Sweet rest at last. Near after distant,
Gleam after gloom, Love after loneliness, Life after tomb. After long
agony, Rapture of bliss, Right was the pathway leading to this.

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
