Cooking  times will vary but this will work on almost any  type of
covered BBQ or smoker. I don't like to fire  up  all  that often, and
usually have company planned when I do one of these. So they are
fairly large.

In  a large bowl, or on the counter top (like I do it)  combine
everything except the cheese dip and bbq sauce.

Fix yourself a large sheet of aluminum foil. (I usually make it double
wide). Move the meatloaf over onto the foil and form  a large  loaf.
I also like to turn the edges of the foil  over  a couple of times,
because of the weight.

After you have formed the loaf, open the cheese dip and  spread over
the top of the loaf. The spread BBQ sauce over the top  of the  cheese
(Piquante  sauce  or  salsa  makes  an   excellent substitute for the
BBQ sauce..I don't recommend ketsup at all.)

When the coals are ready on your BBQ, put the meatloaf on,  and then
put the cover on it. Usually takes around 45-60 minutes to cook.  Use
a meat fork or an ice pick to put some holes in  the foil  after you
get it on, so that the fat can drain off,  into the coals. I usually
do a few around the edges, as well as some through  the  meat  in
various places. Whenever I check  the meatloaf, I also check and make
sure the grease is draining ok.

Will  serve  at least two people. The doritos give the  loaf  a
totally different flavour, and also combine to make  a  fairly tight
meatloaf. Excellent sandwiches. Last time I did one at  a small
party, it fed 16 people.
