MANGO SALSA

Chef Francisco Rivera of Galileo serves this jazzy salsa on greens
with tender-sweet leaf-wrapped sea scallops. He marinates the
scallops briefly with a sprinkle of olive oil, black pepper, chopped
basil and garlic, wraps them in vine leaves and grills them on an
oiled grill 3 minutes a side.

Mix ingredients gently and let sit several hoursto blend flavors.
Serve at room temperature. Excellent with fish.
