Title: Sauteed Salmon with Asparagus and Fresh Dill
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 6 servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS (QNTJ65A)
1/2 md Red onion
2 md Red potatoes (about 3/4 lb)
1 lb Fresh asparagus
2 tb Fresh squeezed lemon juice
1 lb Salmon steaks
1 tb Olive oil
4    Garlic cloves; minced
1/4 ts Salt
Pepper to taste
1/4 c  Fresh dill; minced
6    Wedges lemon
Cut the onion in half lengthwise and slice thinly. Scrub the potatoes
and dice them; do not peel.  Snap off and discard the rough stem ends
of the asparagus and cut the stalks at a slant into 2-inch lengths.
Heat 3/4 cup water and the lemon juice to a boil in a skillet that
has a tight-fitting lid.  Rinse the salmon and place into the boiling
water. Cover, reduce heat to low, and poach for 4 minutes, then turn,
cover, and cook 3 to 5 minutes longer, depending on the thickness of
the fish.  Fish is done when mostly opaque but still barely
translucent at the very center. Remove from the water and set aside
on a tea towel.

Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan or skillet over medium heat.
Add garlic and stir for a moment or two, then add the onion and
potatoes and saute 7 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add the
asparagus, salt, and pepper and saute, stirring frequently 7 minutes
more, until asparagus is fork tender. Meanwhile, remove any skin and
bones from the salmon and break up into bite-size pieces. Add to the
skillet along with the fresh dill, toss to combine well, and heat
through for one minute. Serve very hot, passing the lemon wedges.
