Categories: Bon appetit, Main dish, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
6    6-oz boneless rib-eye steaks
-(1 inch thick), excess fat
-trimmed
1 1/2 ts Coarsely ground black pepper
2 tb Vegetable oil
3 tb Minced garlic
1/2 c  Dry red wine
1/2 c  Canned beef broth
4 ts Country-style Dijon mustard
4 1/2 tb Butter, cut into pieces
3 tb Minced fresh parsley
Season steaks on both sides with salt. Rub pepper into both sides of
each steak. Divide oil between 2 heavy large skillets and heat over
medium-high heat. Add 3 steaks to each skillet and cook to desired
doneness, about 3 1/2 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to
platter. Tent with foil to keep warm.

Divide garlic between skillets; saute 30 seconds. Divide wine between
skillets; boil until reduced by half, stirring up any browned bits,
about 1 minute. Combine contents of skillets in 1 skillet. Add broth
and mustard and whisk until blended. Boil until slightly thickened,
about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Add butter; whisk just
until melted. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over steaks.
Top with parsley.
