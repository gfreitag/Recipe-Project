Categories: Wok, Chinese, Fish/seafoo, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
18 lg Shrimp, peeled & deveined
Salt & pepper; to taste
1    Egg white
1/2 ts Cornstarch
2 c  Oil
1    Garlic clove; chopped
1/2 c  Diced onion

Hot sauce (see recipe)
Marinate the shrimp in salt, pepper, egg white, & cornstarch for 30
minutes. Heat wok hot & dry. Add oil. When just beginning to smoke,
add shrimp, stirring quickly so that pieces separate. After 2
minutes, drain through colander or sieve, reserving 2-3 tbs. oil.
Prepare the Hot Sauce. Return reserved oil to wok. Add garlic &
onion, letting them brown slightly. Add water chestnuts, mushrooms &
shrimp. Blend in Hot Sauce & flip contents of wok for 1-2 minutes or
until everything is hot. Place on serving platter & sprinkle with
chopped scallions.

Note: Flipping wok is better than stir-frying since the food is not
touched in any way.
