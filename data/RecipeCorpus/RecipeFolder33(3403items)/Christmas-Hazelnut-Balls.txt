Title: Christmas Hazelnut Balls
Categories: Cake/cookie, Holiday
Yield: 20 servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Margarine
1 c  Hazelnuts -- or pecans
2 tb Sugar
1/8 ts Salt
1 ts Vanilla extract
Confectioner's sugar
1. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl except the confectioner's
sugar. Use a large wooden spoon or your hands to mix thoroughly. 2.
Refrigerate dough for 30 minutes -- a very important step. 3. Form
dough into 1-1/4-inch balls. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie
sheet. Bake in preheated 375-degree oven for 15-20 minutes or until
set but not brown. Do not overcook. 4. Let stand 1 minute in pan then
remove to wire rack. Cool until barely warm. Roll in sifted
confectioners sugar. Cool completely, then just before serving, roll
again in the confectioners sugar.

Yield: about 20 balls. Do not make them too large or they will not
cook properly.
