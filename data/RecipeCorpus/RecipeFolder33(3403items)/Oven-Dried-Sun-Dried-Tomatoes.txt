Title: Oven Dried Sun Dried Tomatoes
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
Tomatoes (from 10 to 1000!)
Salt (coarse is better)
Vinegar
Olive Oil
Assorted herbs, optional
Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Half or Quarter the tomatoes depending on
size. Place them cut side up on baking sheets and salt them down. The
salt is used mainly to expedite the drying process. Bake at 300 for
four to eight hours--until 'maters are dried. Dip in vinegar, and
pack in sterilized jars with Olive Oil. Add herbs if you wish
(Oregano seems an obvious first choice, but others would be
interesting). Refrigerate. Keeps for many many months. USES: In cold
salads, tossed in pasta (hmmm...like a creme sauce with slivers of
dried tomatoes...I'm getting hungry...), in omlettes, etc. etc.
