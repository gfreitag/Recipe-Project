Categories: Bon appetit, Desserts, Ice cream
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Santa Rosa or other red-
-fleshed plums, pitted,
-chopped
1    Vanilla bean, split
-lengthwise
3/4 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Water
1/2 c  Hazelnuts, toasted, chopped
1 tb Brandy
1 pt Vanilla frozen yogurt,
-slightly softened
3    Plums, halved, pitted,

Puree chopped plums in blender until smooth. Press puree through
sieve into bowl, Transfer 1 1/2 C puree to small saucepan. (Reserve
remaining puree for another use.) Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into
saucepan with puree.

Lightly oil baking sheet. Stir sugar and water in another small
saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to high
and boil without stirring until syrup is deep brown, brushing down
sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally.

Working quickly, pour half of caramel into plum puree (caramel will
harden on contact). Set aside. Immediately mix hazelnuts into
remaining caramel in pan. Scrape nut mixture onto oiled baking sheet.
Let stand until completely cool. Coarsely chop praline.

Stir puree in saucepan over medium heat until caramel melts, about 2
minutes. Transfer plum sauce to bowl; cool. Mix in brandy. (Praline
and sauce can be prepared 2 days ahead. Store praline airtight at room
temperature. Cover sauce and refrigerate.)

Finely chop enough praline to measure 1/4 C. Wrap tightly and
reserve. Fold remaining coarsely chopped praline into frozen yogurt;
freeze until firm, at least 1 hour and up to six hours.

Spoon some plum sauce into hottom of each of 6 stemmed glasses. Top
with half of plum slices, then 2 small scoops vanilla frozen yogurt.
Spoon remaining plum sauce over. Top sundaes with remaining plums and
reserved praline and serve.
