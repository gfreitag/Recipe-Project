When you brown the pot stickers and then cook them in water, they
have only a fraction of the calories and fat of the deep fat-fried
Thai Wontons. Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray; add
1/2 teaspoon oil. Place over medium-high heat until hot. Add
gingerroot and garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until tender.
Remove from heat, and stir in chicken and next 6 ingredients.

Cut egg roll wrappers in half lengthwise.  Lightly brush edges with 1
tablespoon water.  Place about 1 tablespoon chicken mixture at base
of a wrapper half; fold the right bottom corner over to form a
triangle to end

of wrapper half. Repeat procedure with remaining wrapper halves and
chicken mixture. Coat skillet with cooking spray; add 1 tablespoon
oil. Add filled egg roll wrappers; cook 1 minute oneach side or until
golden. Add 2/3 cup water; cook 5 minutes or until water evaporates,
turning once. Combine apricot spread and remaining ingredients; stir
well. Serve pot stickers with apricot sauce.  Yield: 16 appetizers.
