Title: Tarragon Poached Fish
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Healthy
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 lb Fish fillets -- * see note
1 tb Margarine
1/2 c  Chopped green onions
1/4 ts Tarragon
2/3 c  Chicken broth -- low sodium
1/4 ts Salt -- to taste
Black pepper
Lemon wedges
* Use fresh fish fillets or steaks. If using frozen, allow extra
cooking time.

Rinse fish and pat dry. In large heavy skillet, melt margarine over
medium heat (use olive oil instead of margarine if desired). Add
chopped onions and tarragon leaves. Cook until onions are limp; about
3 minutes. Add broth and bring to a boil. Place fish in single layer
in this mixture. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until just
translucent. Do not overcook.

* Approximate cooking time: if using fresh fillets about 3/4 inch
thick, will take about 6 minutes, 1-1/2 inch thick will take about 12
minutes.

Carefully remove fish from pan, place on serving plate and keep warm.
Turn heat to high and allow the juices in pan to cook until reduced
to about one half. Pour juice over fish and immediately serve with
lemon wedges, salt and pepper if desired.
