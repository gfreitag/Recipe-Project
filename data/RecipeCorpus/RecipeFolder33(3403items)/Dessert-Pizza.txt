* Use a deep dish 9-inch pie crust for this recipe or use an

1. Place pie crust on cookie sheet to thaw. When thawed, use hands to
press flat and shape into 12-inch circle. Flute edges and pierce all
over gently with a fork. Bake in preheated 425-degree oven 10-12
minutes or until lightly browned. 2. Place cream cheese in a large
bowl and beat, with mixer set at high speed, until smooth. Add orange
peel and beat until well mixed. While beater is running, slowly pour
in corn syrup and continue beating until light and fluffy. 3. In a
small bowl, beat milk and pudding mix at low speed for 2 minutes,
then fold into cheese mixture. 4. Spoon onto cooled pie crust;
sprinkle with toasted coconut. 5. Peel orange and slice thin,
removing all white pith and seeds. Arrange slices on top of coconut
along with kiwi slices. Halve grapes and press, cut side down, in a
decorative pattern. Place whole or half strawberries in a pattern
also. Lightly sift powdered sugar over the top of pizza; cover
loosely with plastic wrap and chill until serving time.
