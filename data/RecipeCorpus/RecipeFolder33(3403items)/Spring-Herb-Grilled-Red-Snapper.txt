These fish are easily cleaned by carefully cutting a 2" slit along the
bottom, reaching in with your finger toward the gills and removing the
innards. Serving them whole allows your guests to enjoy all the sweet
tender meat.

1. Prepare grill with hot coals or preheat the broiler.

2. Rinse the fish inside and out, then pat dry. Brush the snapper
inside and out with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place 3 or
4 sprigs of thyme inside each fish. Close the openings with small
metal skewers.

3. Lightly oil the grill rack and place the fish on the rack, 4" from
the heat source. Grill until cooked through, 4-6 minutes per side,
turning once. Serve immediately on a decorative platter garnished
with remaining thyme sprigs, the lemon halves and some fresh
nasturnium flowers, if available. Serve the Light and Hot Sauce
alongside.
