2 lg Onions; sliced
2 tb Soy or fish sauce
2 c  Turnips; diced

Ask the butcher to saw the shin bones into 1-1/2 inch lengths.
Drop into a large pot of boiling water, return to a boil, and simmer
for 5 minutes. Drain.  In a large saucepan melt the lard and fry the
annatto seeds until the fat is red.  Strain off and discard the
seeds, fry the garlic and onions in the colored lard to soften and
color. Remove. Fry the meat, 4 to 5 pieces at a time, until evenly
colored. Add water to cover and soy or fish sauce; bring to a boil.
Cook for 1-3/4 to 2 hours over medium-low heat.  Add onions and
vegetables with salt and pepper and cook until almost tender.  Grind
peanuts and rice to a coarse powder. Add to the stew and cook until
the sauce is thick. Check seasoning, and serve hot.
