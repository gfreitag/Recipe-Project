Yield: 1 servings
3 tb Butter
1/4 c  Chopped onion
4 c  Cherry tomatoes
1/2 c  Brown sugar or honey
3/4 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Buttered bread crumbs
Saute onions in butter.  Add washed cherry tomatoes with stems
removed, 6 Tbsp. of brown sugar or honey and salt.  Cook very slowly,
using asbestos mat under skillet to prevent sticking, until liquid
evaporates. Put mixture in baking dish.  Top with bread crumbs and

Another way to serve cherry tomatoes is sauteed in butter with garlic,
chives, dill or shallots. Or leave their stems on and dunk them raw
in sour cream and chives.
