(Fruitwood gives an especially nice flavor.) Sear roast until brown.
Let fire die down and then continue to grill with lid on.  Turn roast
occasionally and grill approximately 1 hour (depending on fire) or
until just beyond pink in the center.  Place pork on platter and
cover with foil to keep warm. Quickly make sauce by bringing marinade
to boil in small non-aluminum pan. Add 1/2 cup water and boil 3
minutes.  Reduce heat and add:

and top rounds with sauce.
