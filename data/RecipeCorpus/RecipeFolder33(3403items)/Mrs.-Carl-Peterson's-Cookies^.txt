Categories: Cake/cookie, Oldies, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Lard or shortening
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Molasses
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Ginger
1    Egg
2 c  Flour
Beat lard until it is soft. Add sugar and beat again. Add egg, beat
until it's fluffy. Put in molasses, baking soda, and ginger and mix
well. Stir in flour. Drop by spoonfuls onto a baking sheet. Bake in a
moderate oven about 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Grandma Signe
wrote in her book, next to this recipe, the single word "good".

Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos
and all.
