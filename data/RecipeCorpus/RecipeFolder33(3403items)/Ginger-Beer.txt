Title: Ginger Beer
Categories: Beverages, Mixed drink
Yield: 1 servings
3/4 c  Ginger
6 c  Water -- boiling
2    Whole limes -- Key Limes
Prefered
1 1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Yeast
Dump all this crap together in a really big mason jar or some other
jar that can be sealed and  stir it all up until it is all dissolved.
Seal the sucker up nice and tight and stuff it in the closet behind
the vacuum cleaner or your bill box.  Make sure the closet isn't too
hot or too cold-- you know keep the stuff at room temperature. Now
forget about it. Listen to BBBB six to eight times in a row (wait at
least twenty four hours). Go to the closet open the sucker up, strain
the shit through a pair of panty hose, then refrigerate the stuff
until its really really cold. Drink it straight or use it in some of
the recipes that follow. (like a dark and stormy) Gives you Ã”bout 1/2
gallon.
