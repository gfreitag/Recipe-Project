Title: Black Bun
Categories: Scot/irish, Cake/cookie, Alcohol, Holiday
Yield: 1 cake
8 oz Flour
1 lb Currants
1 lb Raisins
2 oz Mixed peel; chopped
4 oz Caster sugar
4 oz Almonds; blanched & chopped
1/4 pt Milk
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Ground ginger
1/2 ts Ground allspice
pn Ground cloves
pn Black pepper
1/2 ts Bicarbonate of soda
1 tb Brandy
12 oz Shortcrust pastry
1    Egg; beaten for glazing
Set oven to 350Ã¸F or Mark 4.  Mix the flour, bicarbonate of soda,
spices and sugar in a bowl. Add the raisins, currants, mixed peel and
almonds. Moisten the mixture with the milk and brandy and stir well.
Roll out two-thirds of the pastry to line a well greased 10 inch cake
tin. Fill with the fruit mixture and make a lid with remaining
pastry. Seal the edges using a little cold water; press firmly. Brush
with beaten egg. Finally make four holes with a skewer right to the
bottom of the tin. Bake for 2-2 1/2 hours; the cake is ready when a
skewer pushed in comes out clean. If the top is browning too much,
protect with greaseproof paper. Cool, slice and serve.

This festive cake is traditionally eaten at Hogmanay.
