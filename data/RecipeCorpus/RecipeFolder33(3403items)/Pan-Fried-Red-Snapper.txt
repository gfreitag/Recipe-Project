From "Bobby Flay's Bold American Food" (warner Books, $34.95):
American red snapper is sometimes hard to find, but it is the best,
so ask for it at your fish market. Some of the imported snapper is
hardly worth bothering about, and you may want to substitute halibut
or sea bass if only the imports are available. Cook the fish
naturally - never dredge it in flour before frying.

In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat the oil until it begins to
smoke and then add the butter. Season the fillets on both sides with
salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, starting
with the skin-side down. (If you have an electric range, brown the
fillets on one side, turn them, and finish cooking in a preheated
350'F. oven for 3 minutes.) Remove the cooked fillets to a warm plate
and serve immediately with the vinaigrette (recipe follows).
