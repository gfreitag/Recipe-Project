Title: Indiana Farm Sausage
Categories: Sausage
Yield: 1 servings
2 lb Lean ground pork, at room
Temperature
1/3 c  Finely chopped onion
2 ts Finely minced fresh parsley
2 ts Salt
1 ts Rubbed sage
1 ts Dried basil (optional)
1 ts Dried marjoram (optional)
1 ts Chili powder
1 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Ground red pepper
1/4 ts Dried thyme (optional)
In a deep bowl, combine all ingredients, using hands if necessary. On
wax paper, shape and roll mixture into 2 logs, 6 inches long and 2
inches in diameter.  Wrap in plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate
overnight.

To serve, slice the rolls into rounds about 1/2 inch thick and fry in
a heavy skillet over medium-low heat for 3 to 4 minutes on each side
or until done.  Drain on paper towels and serve immediately.

An alternate way to prepare sausage is to shape mixture into large
marble-size balls.  Freeze if desired.  To serve, bake frozen on a
rack, starting in a cold oven, for 20 min. at 325 F.
