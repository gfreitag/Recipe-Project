-2-1/2 lbs)

-orange
Finely pared zest of 1/2
-grapefruit
4 tb Light brown sugar, or to
-taste
3/4 c  Pineapple juice

This is a particularly good treatment for a pineapple that turns out
not to be as sweet as it should be.  The better the port, the better
the dessert. Make this dessert a day ahead for the best flavour.

Peel, slice and core the pineapple and cut into 1 inch cubes or thin
slices.  In pan, cook the zests, sugar and pineapple juice. Cook
until the zests are tender, about 5 minutes.  While the liquid is
still warm, add the pineapple pieces and stir in the port.
Refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight.  Allow to come up to
room temperature before serving or flavours will be lost.

VARIATION: Cut pineapple into tiny cubes.  Pour a little tequila over
it just before serving.  Garnish with mint sprigs.  This Mexican idea
for a hot weather dessert also work well as a first course.
