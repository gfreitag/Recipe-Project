Title: Jalapeno Grits in Red Pepper Cups
Categories: Side dish, Nuts/grains, Chilies
Yield: 8 servings
4 md Red bell peppers
Olive oil
1 c  Old-fashioned
-or medium-ground grits
4 tb Unsalted butter
1 md Jalapeno chile, minced
1 c  Heavy cream
Salt and freshly ground
-black pepper
1/2 c  Plain dry bread crumbs
1. Preheat the broiler. Halve the bell peppers crosswise. Remove and
discard the stems, seeds and ribs. Using your hands, lightly rub the
peppers with olive oil. Place them, cut side down, on a lightly
greased baking sheet and broil, turning once, until lightly charred.
(Alternatively, grill the pepper cups on a hot grill, turning, until
lightly charred.)

2. In a large saucepan, bring 4 cups of lightly salted water to a
boil over high heat. Gradually whisk in the grits. Reduce the heat to
low, cover and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the grits
are tender, smooth and thick, about 20 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small nonreactive skillet over
moderately high heat. Add the jalapeno and cook, stirring, until
slightly soften, about 2 minutes. Stir the butter and jalapeno into
the grits along with the heavy cream. Season well with salt and black
pepper.

4. Preheat the oven to 375F. Sprinkle half of the bread crumbs in the
bottom of the 8 red pepper cups. Divide the grits among the pepper
cups, mounding them slightly. Sprinkle the remaining bread crumbs on
top. (The recipe can be made to this point up to 3 hours ahead. Cover
and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before
proceeding.) Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes until hot. Serve at
once.
