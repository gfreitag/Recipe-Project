Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Cream sherry
3 tb Honey
1/3 c  Soy sauce
1/2 ts Fersh ginger root; grated
2    Cl Garlic; pressed
3 tb Vinegar
Mix honey into sherry until smooth, add soy sauce. press garlic and
add to the mixture. Grate ginger root and stir.

Add 2 tbls vinegar - taste - if you want it more sour add 3rd tbls
vinegar.

Grill chicken as per your own liking, tourning often every 5-8 min to
prevent charringand brush top side only after turning each side.

If the sauce is to thin you can thicken it with a bit of cornstarch
and water. When it is thick enough so it doesn't run off immediately
you have it just right. Offer left over sauce for dipping chicken in.

For mexican flavor add chili powder and cayenne to taste.

For lamb add mint to basic sauce

For beef add cinnamon and curry powder (madras) to basic sauce.

For pork add brown sugar and cinnamon to basic sauce.

For other variations, add pineapple chunks and/or bell pepper chunks,
red, green, yellow make for great coor and taste. You can put in a
touch of garlic and onion is always good in it.

Of course the chunky stuff will have to be added after you are through
BBQing and have it at the table for the dipping  or pouring over
meat. Cook peppers, onions and garlic in the sauce after the bbqing
is done. If y bbq with chunks they fall into bbq and give you a burnt
smell.
