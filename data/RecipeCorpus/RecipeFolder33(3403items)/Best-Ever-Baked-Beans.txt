Combine all ingredients, except in bacon, in large ovenproof
container. Lay bacon strips on top.  Place on smoker grid and smoke
for 2 to 2-1/2 hours.

Note from me:  If you don't have a smoker, you can cook at about 350
F for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the bacon is curling.  Better
flavor in a smoker, but divine beans without!

This is undoubtedly one of the best baked bean dishes we've ever
tasted. Easy to make and no tending necessary.  You can have ribs
smoking on the bottom rack and beans on the top rack.  Add garlic
bread and coleslaw, potato salad or macaroni salad and you've got a
Super Bowl party, bowl game or Monday Night Football dinner!

Fred Towner: This is very similar to what I used to make, except I
used to use dry mustard and in place of the molasses I used to use
maple syrup. Source: "Cook'n Cajun Water Smoker Cookbook" by Sondra
