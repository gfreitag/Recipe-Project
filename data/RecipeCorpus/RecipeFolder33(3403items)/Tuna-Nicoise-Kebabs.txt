Title: Tuna Nicoise Kebabs
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Newspaper, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2/3 c  Italian dressing
1 1/2 tb Rosemary; chopped
1 lb Tuna steak
1 lb Red potatoes; scrubbed
8    Scallions, trimmed
1    Head romaine lettuce;
-  separated into leaves
1/2 c  Nicooise or other black
-  olives
2    Plum tomatoes, cut into
-  wedges
In a measuring cup, combine the Italian dressing and rosemary.  Place
the tuna in a shallow dish.  Pour 1/2 cup of dressing over the tuna
and stir to coat.  Reserve remaining dressing.  Refrigerate the tuna
up to 2 hours.

Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water until barely fork tender,
about 8 minutes.  Drain and add warm potatoes to shallow dish with
the tuna, turning to coat with the marinade.  About 15 minutes before
cooking, add scallions to tuna and potatoes, turning to coat with
marinade.

Thread scallions, tuna and potatoes onto 4 long metal skewers,
beginning and ending with scallions and alternating chunks of tuna
and potatoes in the center.  Grill the kebabs (or broil 6 inches from
heat), turning once or twice, until tuna is no longer pink, potatoes
are tender and scallions are browned (about 10 minutes).

Serve kebabs on a bed of romaine lettuce and drizzle with remaining
Italian dressing.  Garnish with olives and tomatoes.
