Combine all marinade ingredients and using a wire whisk, stir to
ensure that all seasonings are well blended. Add chicken breasts and
cover with the marinade. Allow to sit at room temperature for thirty
minutes.

FOR SMOKING: Prepare home style smoker according to manufacturer's
instructions. Have available chips of pecan wood and sugar cane if
possible. In the water pan, place one quart of water and two cans of
Barq's root beer. The root beer will give the chicken a taste that is
certainly unique. Once smoker is ready, place water pan in position
and add small amounts of pecan wood and sugar cane to hot coals.
Place chicken breasts on middle smoker rack and cook according to
directions. Check for doneness at one hour. The chicken breasts may
be eaten warm on colored lettuces as an entree salad or sliced cold
and served with sweet mustard as an appetizer.
