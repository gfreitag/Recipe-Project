Brandy
OR:
Dark rum
* Use brandy or rum for this recipe, with ripe, unblemished fruit in
season. Use a crock or jar with tight fitting lid.

1. Remove stems from fruit but leave fruit whole. Peel large fruits
such as peaches, apricots and plums. 2. Place fruit carefully into
the container of your choice. Fill the container completely but
without packing the fruit to avoid bruising. 3. Add enough brandy or
rum to completely cover fruit. Close container tightly and store at
room temperature. Let stand at least 3 weeks before using; 4 weeks is
even better. 4. As you use the fruit replenish with more fruit and
cover with more brandy or rum.

* Use a variety of fruits and berries. Some suggestions are: peaches,
plums, apricots, grapes, blackberries, raspberries, cherries and
nectarines.
