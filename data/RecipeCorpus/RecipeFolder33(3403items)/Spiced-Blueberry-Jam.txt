Title: Spiced Blueberry Jam
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Dips/spread, Fruit
Yield: 3 cups
7 c  Blueberries (or two 12-oz
Packages frozen blueberries)
1/2 c  Plus 2 Tbsp apple-grape
Concentrate sweetener (see
Separate recipe)
2 tb Orange juice
2 tb Water
3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground cloves
1/4 ts Ground mace
1. If using fresh blueberries, wash, drain and remove any bits of
stem.

2. In a 4-quart saucepan, combine the berries, apple-grape sweetener,
orange juice, water, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and mace.  Bring to a
boil and reduce the heat to medium.  Cook at a low boil 20 minutes,
stirring often, until very thick.  (To test for gelling, put about
1/2 teaspoon jam on a chilled saucer and place in freezer for 1
minute.  If, when cooled, jam wrinkles when touched, it is done.)
Skim the foam from the top of the jam during the cooking time.

3. Ladle into freezer containers, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.  Cool,
cover and place in freezer.
