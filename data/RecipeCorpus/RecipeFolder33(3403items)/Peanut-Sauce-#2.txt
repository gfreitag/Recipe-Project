Title: Peanut Sauce #2
Categories: Thai, Condiments
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 c  Peanut oil
1/2 c  Raw peanuts
2    Fresh jalapeno peppers
1 sl Fresh ginger
4    Garlic cloves
1/3 c  Unsweetened coconut milk
2 ts Dark soy sauce
4 ts Fish sauce
1 ts Sugar
1 tb Fresh lime juice
1 pn Salt
1/2 c  Minced cilantro leaves
Heat the peanut oil to nearly smoking in a saucepan. Turn off the
heat and add the peanuts. The peanuts should cook to a golden brown
in 3-5 minutes. If you burn them, throw them out and start all over
again or your sauce will be bitter. You may have to turn on the heat
again, but stir the peanuts if you do. Using a slotted spoon,
transfer the peanuts to the container of a food processor or blender,
along with 1 T of the peanut oil (reserve the rest) and blend them to
a rough paste. Add the chiles, ginger, garlic and continue to blend.
Add the remaining ingredients except the cilantro, and blend until
smooth. If it is too thick, add more oil. Stir in cilantro, and serve
with satay.
