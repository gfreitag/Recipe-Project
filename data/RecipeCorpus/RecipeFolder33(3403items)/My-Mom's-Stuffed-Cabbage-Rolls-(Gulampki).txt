Take one medium head of cabbage and put under hot water and let it
run over the cabbage until the leaves come off easily. Prepare a
large pot of hot water, and let it simmer to a rolling boil. Put the
cabbage leaves in the hot water for a few minutes until they are

Roll the meat mixture in the long part of the cabbage leaf and fix it

wrap with bacon. Put into a large baking dish (enamel is preferable)
and bake at 350 F for about 1/2 hour until brown.

Pour tomato sauce, which has been mixed with oregano, garlic, onion
flakes and salt, over the rolls. Canned, crushed tomatoes and paste
may also be used.

Bake at 350F for about 1 hour, or until bacon is brown.

Happy Eating!!!!!
