Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 4 servings

1. Dissolve yeast in warm water (105-110 degrees) in mixing bowl. Let
stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Mix in remaining ingredients
with a wire whisk or mixer until smooth. 2. Cover tightly and
refrigerate up to 24 hours. 3. To prepare the griddle, heat over high

medium and use about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. Cook until
pancakes are dry around edges and top is bubbly. Turn and cook other
side until browned.

Yield: 12-14 pancakes.

Prepare this batter the night before, remove and let stand at room
temperature for about 10 minutes before cooking.
