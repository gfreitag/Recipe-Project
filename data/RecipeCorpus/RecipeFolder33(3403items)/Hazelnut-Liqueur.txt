Title: Hazelnut Liqueur
Categories: Mixed drink, Beverages, Alcohol
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 lb Hazelnuts  -- finely
Chopped
1 1/2 c  Vodka
1/3 c  Sugar
3 tb Water
1 ts Vanilla extract
In a glass bottle or jar, steep the chopped hazelnuts in the vodka for
about 2 weeks in a cool, dark place, gently shaking the bottle every
day.

Gently pour the contents through a strainer or sieve, pressing hard
on the nuts to release all the flavor.

Follow this by 2 strainings through slightly dampened cheesecloth or
large coffee filter; loosely cover the contents with plastic wrap,
since the process may take several hours.

In a very small saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Bring to a
boil over moderate-high heat.

Simmer, uncovered for 5 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Stir
in the vanilla.

Funnel into a glass bottle, the funnel in the sugar syrup. Cover
tightly; shake to blend. Let mature at room temperature, or slightly
cooler, for at leat 3 weeks.

Homemade version of Frangelico.  "Glorious Liqueurs" Mary Morris.
