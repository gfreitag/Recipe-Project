Categories: Breads, Meats
Yield: 8 servings
1 pk Yeast -- not instant
1/4 c  Water
1/2 c  Milk
1 c  Mashed potatoes
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 lg Egg
1 1/2 c  Ham -- diced
4 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 c  Sesame seeds
1. Soften yeast in 1/4 cup warm water in a large mixing bowl for
about 5 minutes. 2. Stir in milk which has been scalded and cooled to
lukewarm. Add potatoes, oil, sugar and salt. Cut salt amount if
mashed potatoes were prepared with salt. Add egg, ham and 2 cups
flour. Beat very well. 3. Cover and let rise in warm place until
light and double in size, about 1 to 1-1/2 hours. 4. Stir in
remaining flour (may not need quite all) to form a stiff dough. Knead
until smooth, about 4-5 minutes. 5. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sesame
seeds on greased cookie sheet. Roll out half of dough on cookie sheet
to a 14 x 10-inch rectangle. Brush with milk and sprinkle with 1
tablespoon sesame seeds. Repeat with remaining dough, using a second
cookie sheet. 6. Cover and let rise until light, about 1 hour. Bake
in preheated 400-degree oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
7. Cool, then cut into 1-inch squares to serve with Swiss Fondue or
cut into large slices to serve with soups or stews.
