Title: Pumpkin And Maple Sugar Pie
Categories: Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
16 oz Pumpkin, canned
2 tb All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/2 ts Ground ginger
1 tb Margarine
1 c  Sugar
1 c  Milk
2 tb Maple syrup
2    Eggs
1    9 inch pie crust -- unbaked
1    Whipped cream -- optional
In a mixing bowl, combine all ingredients except the last two. Pour
into the pie shell. Bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Reduce heat
to 350 and continue baking for about 45 minutes more, or until knife
inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool to room temperature,
refrigerate. Garnish with whipped cream if desired. Try to use REAL
maple syrup for this pie; it does not taste the same with the
imitation type.
