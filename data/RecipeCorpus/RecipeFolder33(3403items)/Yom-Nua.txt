RECIPE
(Thai Beef Salad) Here is a sure fire winner of a Thai dish. We call
it beef salad and the Thai name is Yom Nua. To make it, use round
steak or a roast. Slice it up into 1/2 to 3/4" slabs if it's thick.
Sprinkle with meat tenderizer. Broil or grill until medium rare.
Slice into strips about 1/8" thick. The strips should be bite sized.
Slice red or yellow onion very thin and break up the rings. Use about
1/2 onion per pound of meat. Place meat in a large bowl and add
onions with some lemon juice, ground chili peppers, fish sauce (Nam
Pla), and MSG. Mix it all together then mix in one thin sliced
cucumber, 5 or 10 mint leaves, and a pinch of Chinese parsley
(optional). Make a bed of lettuce and put the mixture on it. Serve
with hot white rice. Wing Means, El Paso
