Title: Smoked Turkey (Justin Wilson)
Categories: Bbq/grill, Herbs/spice, Cajun/creol
Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM--------------------WATER PAN SEASONINGS-------------------------
1 c  White wine - dry
1 ea Onion - whole
1 ea Garlic clove - whole
1 tb Liquid smoke
1 ts Dried mint - crushed
2 tb Parsley, chopped
6    Drops Peychaud's bitters
2 tb Lea & Perrins Worcestershire
-sauce
Prepare smoker.  While briquets are starting to burn, sprinkle
carcass and cavity with salt and cayenne pepper.  I put a whole onion
inside the cavity, but you can make a stuffing if you like.  Be
careful not to use ingredients in the stuffing that will spoil too
quickly.

I put a pork roast on the top rack of my smoker and a turkey on the
bottom rack.  Then I fill the water pan plumb up and let it cook
while I sleep at night.
