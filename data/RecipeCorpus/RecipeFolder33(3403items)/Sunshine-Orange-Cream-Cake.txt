Title: Sunshine Orange Cream Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1/3 c  Margarine
3 tb Packed light brown sugar
2/3 c  Sugar
1/3 ts Vanilla extract
2    Eggs
1 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Baking soda
2 ts Double-acting baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 pt Sour cream
2/3 c  Milk
1    Orange -- *see note
* Peel orange, cut into quarters and thinly slice across the
sections, or cut into a pretty pattern of your choice.

1. Cream margarine and sugars until light and fluffy. Blend in
vanilla. Beat in eggs one at a time. 2. Stir flour, salt, soda, and
baking powder together thoroughly; blend into creamed mixture
alternately with 1/2 cup sour cream and milk. Begin and end with
flour. 3. Pour into greased and waxed paper-lined (grease the waxed
paper lightly also) 13 x 9 x 2-inch pan. Bake in preheated 350-degree
oven, 25-35 minutes or until done. 4. COOL COMPLETELY before removing
from pan. 5. Cut cake in half to form 2 layers 6-1/2 by 9 inches.
Spread 3/4 cup sour cream over layer, arrange orange slices on sour
cream. Top with second layer. Garnish each serving with additional
sour cream and orange slices.

* The sour cream is an acquired taste. You may prefer to sweeten it
with sugar or honey, or with a mix of half sour cream and half
sweetened whipped cream.
