Title: Eggs Baked in Peppers - Washington Time
Categories: Breakfast
2 large, round red peppers
Yield: 4 servings
8 eggs
salt and pepper
2 Tbs.  unsalted butter
1 cup   tomato sauce

1. Select well-shaped peppers that will sit upright.  Halve them
crosswise and remove seeds.  Trim stems but do not make a hole. 2.
Parboil peppers in simmering, salted water until just tender, then
drain peppers. 3. Break eggs 2 eggs into each pepper half.  Season
and top with a 1/2 tablespoon slice of butter.  Place peppers in
small baking pan, pour in 1 inch of hot poaching water, and bake
briefly at 375 degrees until eggs set. 4. Ribbon with tomato sauce.

My suggestions.  Try a spice such as Szechuan Style Pepper or Herb
Pepper Blend instead of the salt and pepper.  (Szechuan is copied
from the label of a McCormick spice jar.  Spell checker suggests the
spelling Szechwan.)

This also could be cooked at a low at a medium setting in a microwave
oven.
