Title: Braised Chicken with Apricots
Categories: Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
5 oz Dried apricots
2 tb Vegetable oil
3 1/2 lb Frying chicken, quartered
1 c  Coarsely chopped onion
2 lg Ripe tomatoes, peeled,
-seeded and chopped
-(2 cups)
1 ts Salt
1 ts Hot paprika
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground coriander
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
2 c  Cooked basmati rice
Pout 1 cup hot water over dried apricots and let them plump while
assembling the other ingredients.

Heat oil in a large skillet or large, deep saucepan and brown the
chicken pieces on both sides over medium heat. Remove chicken from
the pan and set aside. Cook the onion in the skillet until wilted,
about 5 minutes, then stir in the tomatoes, the apricots and their
soaking liquid, the salt, paprika, cinnamon, coriander and pepper,
scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan as you do. Return
the chicken pieces to the skillet, turning them in the sauce to coat.
Cover, lower heat and simmer 25-30 minutes, turning the chicken once.

Skim any surface fat from the sauce and correct the seasoning. Serve
immediately over cooked rice.
