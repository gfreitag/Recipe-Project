This rich but light rye is the cornerstone of a traditional Swedish
breakfast.  The anise and orange peel add just a kiss of flavor to
complement the rye.  Nice with a slice of cheese, a soft-boiled egg
in an egg cup and a cup of strong black coffee!

Success Hints
-------------

You can produce flat ale by opening a dark beer and stirring until the
bubbles disperse.  Scoop off residual foam before measuring ale.

This recipe can be made with the regular or rapid bake cycle.
