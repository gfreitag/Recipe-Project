Title: Healthier Pot Roast
Categories: Meats
Yield: 8 servings
2 lb Beef bottom round
2    Onions -- chopped fine
2    Garlic cloves -- minced
1 ts Coriander seed
1 1/2 ts Ground cumin
10 oz Tomato paste
4 oz Green chili peppers --
Chopped
Black pepper -- to taste
1. Trim meat of all external fat. Use a deep, heavy pot with lid.
Brown meat on all sides. You should not need any added fat to brown
adequately.

2. Add onion and garlic; cook until the onion is soft, about 3-4
minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in coriander, cumin, tomato
paste, 3/4 cup water, chilies and black pepper. Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 2-1/2 to 3 hours or until meat is
tender.

* For freezing, slice into thin slices and freeze in individual
portions. Cover with some of the sauce before freezing. Thaw and
reheat slowly.

Serving Ideas : Serve with noodles and steamed broccoli.

NOTES : This is a healthier version of the traditional pot roast; it
uses a minimum amount of fat when cooking beef. Recipe By
