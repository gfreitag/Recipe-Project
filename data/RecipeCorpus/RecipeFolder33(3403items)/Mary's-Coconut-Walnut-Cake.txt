Canfield Fair ribbon-winner Mary Hartman of Canfield, Ohio, generously
glazes this buttermilk cake with coconut syrup. Baked in a fluted
tube pan, the moist cake freezes well for a make-ahead
special-occasion dessert.

Coconut Syrup (recipe follows)

1. Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan Or fluted tube pan; set the pan
aside.

2. In a mixing bowl, combine eggs, sugar, oil and coconut extract;
beat well.

3. Stir together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add
to egg mixture alternately with buttermilk, beating well after each
addition.

4. Stir in walnuts and coconut. Pour batter into prepared pan.

5. Bake in a 325-F oven for 60 to 65 minutes or till a toothpick
inserted near the center of the cake comes out clean. Place cake on
wire rack; cool in pan for 10 minutes. Remove cake from pan and poke
small holes in the top with a toothpick or a long-tined fork. Brush
hot Coconut Syrup over hot cake. Cool. (Cake freezes well.)
