FOR MERINGUES: Preheat oven to 200'F. Line 2 baking sheets with
parchment paper. Trace two 8-inch circles on 1 sheet; trace one
8-inch circle on second sheet. Turn parchment over.

Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in large
bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar, beating until whites
are thick and glossy (mixture will resemble marshmallow creme). Add
grated orange peel, ground nutmeg and almond extract and beat 4
minutes (meringue will soften). Spread 1 1/2 C meringue in each
traced circle. (To make cookies, drop remaining meringue by heaping
tablespoonfuls outside circles.)

Bake until meringues are dry and just beginning to brown lightly,
about 55 minutes. Turn off oven; keep oven door closed. Leave
meringues in oven 1 hour. Carefully peel parchment off bottom of
meringues.

Place 1 meringue layer in bottom of 9-inch-diameter springform pan
with 2 3/4-inch-high sides. Spread raspberry yogurt over. Top with
second meringue layer; press gently to adhere. Spread orange yogurt
over. Top with third meringue layer; press gently to adhere. Cover
and freeze overnight. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Keepfrozen.)

FOR COMPOTE: Combine first 5 ingredients in heavy large saucepan.
Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. increase heat and boil
until reduced to generous 3/4 C, stirring occasionally, about 20
minutes. Transfer to bowl. Cover; chill until cold. (Sauce can be
made 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.)

Working over bowl to catch juices, cut between orange membranes to re-
lease segments. Combine orange segments, peaches and raspberries in
bowl. Pour sauce over and toss.

Run knife around pan sides to loosen torte. Sift powdered sugar over.
Serve torte with compote.
