MMMMM----------------------PRIMAVERA SAUCE---------------------------
1/4 ts Crushed red chile flakes
2 ea Bay leaves
2 tb Olive oil
1 c  Red onions, chopped
4 ea Garlic cloves, chopped
1/4 c  Green bell pepper, diced
2 c  Zucchini, cubed
1/4 c  Dry white wine
2 ea 28 oz cans whole plum
-- tomates
1 cn Tomato paste
2/3 c  Peas, fresh or frozen
MMMMM--------------------------GNOCCHI-------------------------------
6 md Potatoes, peeled & quartered
4 c  Semolina flour
SAUCE: Heat red chile flakes & bay leaves in oil in a large pot for 1
minute.  Add onion, garlic & green pepper & saute for 3 minutes. Stir
in zucchini & simmer for 5 minutes.  Add wine & simmer for a further
minute. Stir in tomatoes followed by the tomato paste & cook gently
for 20 minutes. Remove from heat & set aside.

GNOCCHI: Cook potatoes until they can be pierced with a fork.  Drain
& mash thoroughly.  Add 3 c semoina & knead until a dough forms.  Add
more flour as necessary until the dough is no longer sticky.  Divide
into quarters & turn onto a floured surface.

Roll each quarter into a cylinder no more than 2" in diameter & cut
into 1" slices.  With a floured fork & thumb, make an indentation in
the centre of each slice & with a gentle rolling motion flip over to
form gnocchi. Set aside & repeat until all dough has been prepared in
this way.

Fill a very large pot with salted water & bring to a full rolling
boil. Place gnocchi in the water, lower to a simmer & stir gently
occasionally. The gnocchi will rise to the surface when it is done.
When this happens, simmer for 8 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon
& place in a casserole. Preheat oven to 350F.

When all the gnocchi has been cooked, toss with the sauce & bake in
the oven for 15 minutes.  Do not cover.  Serve hot.
