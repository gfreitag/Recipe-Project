FOR SAUCE: Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add

Saute until shallot is translucent, about 2 minutes. Remove from

cook until pears are soft, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.
Discard juniper berries. Puree sauce in processor until smooth.
Return mixture to saucepan. Add remaining 1 T bourbon and thin with
more stock, if desired. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be
prepared 1 day ahead Cover and refrigerate.)

FOR LAMB: Preheat oven to 375'F. Combine mustard, maple syrup, shat-
lot, garlic, rosemary and thyme in small bowl. Season with salt and
pepper. Set aside. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high
heat. Add lamb; cook until brown, about 1 minute per side. Remove
from heat; pat lamb dry. Bnish with mustard mixture and sprinkle with
walnuts; press nuts into lamb.

Place lamb on rack in roasting pan. Pour water into roasting pan to
depth of 1/2 inch. Cook until meat thermometer inserted into thickest
part of lamb registers 130'F for medium-rare, about 25 minutes.
Transfer lamb to platter. Let stand 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring sauce to simmer. Cut lamb between bones into 4 double
chops. Place 2 double chops on each plate and serve with sauce.
