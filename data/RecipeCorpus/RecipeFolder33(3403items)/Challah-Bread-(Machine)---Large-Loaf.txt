Success Hints
-------------

For traditional braided Challah, mix ingredients (without poppy
seeds) in the dough cycle.  Turn dough out onto a floured surface,
punch down, divide into ropes and braid, pinching dough together at
ends. Top with poppy seeds.  Lift onto greased baking sheet and allow
to double, about one hour. Bake at 375 degrees for 20-25 minutes.

Use regular or rapid bake cycle.
