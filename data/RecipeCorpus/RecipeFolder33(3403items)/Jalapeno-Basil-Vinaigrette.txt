Title: Jalapeno-Basil Vinaigrette
Categories: Dress/stuff, Hot/spicy
Yield: 2 cups
1 tb Olive oil (for cooking)
1 c  Olive oil
1    Jalapeno pepper
2 tb Diced red onion
1 tb Minced garlic
1 tb Dijon-style mustard
1 tb Balsamic vinegar
1 tb Rice vinegar
1 tb Asian sesame oil (dark,

2 tb Basil chiffonade *
1 tb Ancho chili powder

As soon as the snapper comes off the pan, hit it with the vinaigrette
(which has to be at room temperature).

In a small saute pan over high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil
and cook jalapeno on all sides until skin is charred. Let pepper cool
and then slice it thinly, including seeds and stem.

In a large mixing bowl, combine remaining ingredients, including salt
and pepper to taste, with jalapeno, and whisk until blended. (May be
prepared 6 hours ahead, covered and refrigerated. Bring to room
temperature before serving.)

Spoon charred jalapeno-basil vinaigrette to taste over fish as soon
as you take it from pan and serve it immediately.

* Chiffonade, literally translated from French, means "made of rags."
In the kitchen, it refers to thin shreds or strips cut from such
vegetables as lettuce, spinach, sorrel or other greens.
