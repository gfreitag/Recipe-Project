MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
4 tb Margarine
1/2 ts Chili powder
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb All-purpose flour
2 c  Tomato juice
1. Cut the core from cabbage. Under running water, carefully remove
about 15 leaves to use for the recipe. Have about 2 quarts water
boiling; add 1 teaspoon of salt. Dip the cabbage leaves in boiling
water, 3 at a time, for about 3 minutes. Remove with tongs, drain and
set aside.

2. Mix the meat, onion, cooked rice, margarine, bread crumbs, sage,
pepper, nutmeg and salt. Lay a cabbage leaf on a flat surface. Put
2-4 tablespoons of the mixture on each leaf, depending on the leaf
size. Put the meat near the base of the leaf, fold leaf up and over
the meat, turning under the sides. This will make about 15 rolls.

3. Place the rolls, seam side down, in a greased 2-quart casserole
dish. Make two layers of the rolls. Place this dish on rack over 2
inches of simmering water in wok or large heavy pan with rack. Cover
pan or wok and steam for 35-40 minutes.

TOMATO SAUCE: Melt 4 tablespoons margarine in a skillet. Add the salt,
chili powder and the flour. Mix to a smooth paste. Cook over high
heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil. Remove from
heat and slowly stir in the tomato juice. Return to heat and cook
until it boils and thickens.
