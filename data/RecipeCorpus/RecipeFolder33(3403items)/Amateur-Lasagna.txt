Title: Amateur Lasagna
Categories: Casseroles, Pasta/rice
Yield: 10 servings
10 oz Frozen spinach
60 oz Spaghetti sauce -- two 30 oz
Jars
2 c  Ricotta cheese, part skim
Milk
1 1/2 c  Mozzarella cheese, part skim
Milk -- shredded
1    Egg -- beaten
8 oz Lasagna noodles
1/8 ts Black pepper
1/2 ts Oregano -- optional
1/2 ts Basil -- optional
1/2 c  Vegetable juice cocktail
1/2 c  Water
* Spaghetti sauce is available in a 30 ounce jar and also in smaller
containers. For this recipe, I use about 1-1/2  to 2 jars of the Ragu
Sauce in the 30 ounce container.

1. Thaw the spinach and squeeze dry.

2. In a large container mix the two cheeses, beaten egg, black pepper,
oregano and basil. Add the thawed spinach and blend well.

3. Use a 13 x 9 inch pan. Put a small amount of the sauce in bottom
and spread lightly to cover bottom. This keeps the lasagna from
sticking as it cooks, and enables you to remove it easily in neat
portions.

4. Place one third of the uncooked noodles, one third of the sauce
and one third of the cheese-spinach mixture. Make 3 layers this way,
ending with the sauce.

5. Combine the water and vegetable juice cocktail or tomato juice.
Pour this carefully around the edges of the casserole, moving the
noodles slightly with a spatula to get the liquid distributed evenly.
Sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese if desired.

6. Cover tightly with foil. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour to 1 and
1/4 hours. Remove foil and continue baking for a few minutes more,
until lightly browned and bubbling.

7. Let stand for at least 15 minutes before serving. This lasagna can
be sliced with a flat edged spatula and lifted out in serving-sized
portions.
