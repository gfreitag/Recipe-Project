1. Crush garlic in bowl and add bread which has been torn into small
pieces. This helps give the soup consistency. Add sliced cucumber,
diced green pepper, water and olive oil. Allow this mixture to
marinate for several hours. 2. Add cut-up tomatoes, onions, pimiento
and salt to chilled mixture. Blend in blender or food processor until
the texture you prefer. Chill thoroughly. 3. Just before serving, mix
in vinegar, cold stock and herbs. For added color, flavor and
texture, garnish with garlic croutons, watercress or lime slices.
