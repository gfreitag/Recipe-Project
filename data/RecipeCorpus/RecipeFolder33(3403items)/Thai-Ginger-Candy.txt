Title: Thai Ginger Candy
Categories: Thai, Desserts
Yield: 1 servings
68    GAEW SHIMIZU
14 oz Young ginger -- peeled and
1/8    " thick pieces
8 1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  -water
8 ts -salt
2 ts Lime juice
1. Place ginger slices in a pot and pour in enough water to cover all
the pieces. Bring to a  gentle boil and let the boiling continue for
several

minutes then drain. Repeat this procedure 3-4 times to get rid of the
spiciness.

2. Poke holes in the gingers with a fork or a bamboo skewer and blot
with paper towels (doing this will assure proper absorption of
syrup). Place in a glass jar big enough for ginger and syrup.

3. In a pot, combine 1 1/2 cups sugar, 2 cups water, 2 tsp salt, 2
tbsp lime juice and bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from the
heat and cool. Pour the syrup into the finger jar and cover tightly.
Let stand overnight.

4. Next day, pour out only the syrup into a pot and add 2 cups of
sugar and 2 tsp salt. Bring to a boil or until sugar and salt is
dissolved. Cool and return the syrup to the jar. Cover and let stan
overnight.

5. Next day, repeat step 4, but with only 1/2 cup sugar and let stand
overnight again.

6. Repeat step 5 once more but let stand 2 nights this time.

7. Pour ginger/syrup into a strainer and discard the syrup. Spread
ginger pieces in a single layer on a foil-lined cookie sheet and dry
in the sun or in an oven (lowest heat) until the gingers become
glazed or glisten and dried. Place in a large bowl or zip lock bag
and coat with the remaining sugar (measured at the beginning of this
recipe). Store in an airtight container. Keeps up to 4 months. Serve
with unsweetened tea or other hot beverages. Happy (Thai) Cooking!!
