Keep multiplying in these proportions until you got enough to do you.
This is an excellent thing to do to a 10-lb-or-so whole brisket (_not_
trimmed---you want the streak of fat in the middle to baste the meat
as it cooks).  If you don't have a smoker where you can leave this on
for about 10 or 12 hours, you can do it in the oven, running it at
about 175 F for about 10 hours, and watching it occasionally
(although I have, with success, put a brisket in the oven, gone to
bed, and had it cook through the night for the next day's lunch).  Do
this right, and you come out with a fine-tasting piece of meat.
Wonderful for largish picnics and such.
