1    Chicken breast
1 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Cornstarch
1 tb White vinegar
1 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Dry sherry
1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Cornstarch
Vegetable oil; for blanching
3    Dried red chile pods
1    Green onion; white part only
1/2 ts Fresh minced ginger
1 cl Garlic; minced
2 ts Sesame oil
Pound chicken slightly with a mallet to tenderize and flatten. Cut
into 3/4" by 3/4" pieces. Combine the 1 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 tsp
cornstarch; set aside. Combine next eight ingredients; set aside.

To oil blanch, set wok over high heat for about 1 minute. Add 2 cups
oil and heat to 350 degrees. Add chicken and blanch for 3 to 4
minutes until golden brown. Remove chicken and drain, reserving oil.

To stir fry, remove all but 2 Tbsp oil from the wok. Reheat, swirling
pan to coat sides. Add chili pods and seeds; stir fry about 30
seconds. Return chicken and add green onion, ginger and garlic, stir
frying for another 30 seconds. Pour in the sauce mixture you have set
aside and cook until thickened.

To serve, stir in the sesame oil.

Note: Chile pods are browned to produce the aroma while the seeds are
used to make the dish spicy and hot. Take care not to burn the seeds
or let them get too dark. Shared by Allison Cozzi. From Roy Crockett
