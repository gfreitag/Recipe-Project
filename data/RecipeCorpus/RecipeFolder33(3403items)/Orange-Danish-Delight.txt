Yield: 24 servings
1 pk Yeast
1/2 c  Warm water
1/2 c  Margarine
1 3/4 c  Sugar
2 ts Salt
3/4 c  Milk -- scalded
2 ts Vanilla extract
2 tb Orange peel -- grated
3 lg Eggs
5 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Margarine -- melted
1/2 c  Brown sugar -- packed
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1 1/2 c  Pecan halves
1/3 c  Orange juice
1. Combine yeast and 1/2 cup warm water. Let stand to soften, about 5
minutes. 2. In large mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup softened margarine,
1/2 cup sugar, salt and scalded milk. (Scald milk by heating until
bubbles form around edges and top has a film on it. Do not boil.)
Allow mixture in bowl to cool to lukewarm. 3. Stir in vanilla, orange
peel, 2 eggs, 1 egg yolk and yeast. 4. Gradually add flour to form a
stiff dough, beating well after each addition of the flour. Let rise
in warm place until light and doubled in size, about 1-1/2 to 2
hours. 5. Place a piece of foil on a cookie sheet then turn up all
sides by one inch. Do 3 sheets. Foil size depends on cookie sheet
size. Grease the foil. 6. Roll out dough on floured surface to a 20 x
10-inch rectangle. Brush with 2 tablespoons melted margarine then
sprinkle with 1/4 cup sugar. Fold in thirds. Turn dough 1/4 turn and
repeat folding 2 more times. Roll dough to a 20 x 10-inch rectangle;
spread with remaining melted margarine. Combine brown sugar and
cinnamon: sprinkle on dough. 7. Cut into two 10-inch squares. Roll up
each piece in jelly-roll fashion. Cut each into 12 slices. 8. Place
eight rolls in each foil-lined pan; flatten each to 1/4 inch thick.
9. Combine orange juice and reserved egg white; brush rolls, using
all of mixture. Sprinkle 1/2 cup pecans and 2 tablespoons sugar over
each pan of rolls. Press pecans into rolls. Let rise until light,
about 30 minutes. 10. Bake in preheated 400-degree oven for 17-20
minutes until golden brown. Remove from pan immediately.

Yield: 24 rolls.
