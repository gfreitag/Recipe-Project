I saw your tips on using roasted red bell peppers, Mary.  We love
'em, too. We also like *smoked* red bell peppers.  You smoke them
about 1-1/2 to 2 hours on a hot smoker with lots of hickory chips and
then you can use them like the roasted ones or in a delicious soup,
which I'll post for you in the next message.  We also use the roasted
red bell peppers that come in a jar in the market; there's a favorite
sauce that I'm posting for you, too.
