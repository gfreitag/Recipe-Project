Marinate about fifteen pounds of salmon fillets, rinse and dry well
then cut lengthwise in strips about two inches wide for 6 to 8 hours.
Hang (use cooking twine and a needle to string fillets) for 6 to 8
hours. Hang fillets from rack in smoker or place on lightly oiled
foil on rack. Smoke from 2 to 6 hours depending on smokiness and
dryness desired.

This salmon will keep in the frig for two weeks, or frozen (God
Forbid) for 3 to 6 months.
