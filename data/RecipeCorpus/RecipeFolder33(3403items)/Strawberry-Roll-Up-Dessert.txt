5    Egg whites
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
3/4 c  Powdered sugar

1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 pt Strawberries
1 c  Whipping cream
Beat egg whites until frothy. Add cream of tartar and beat until
stiff. Beat in 3/4 cup powdered sugar gradually. Blend in the beaten
egg yolks, flour and vanilla. Grease a jelly-roll pan. Pour in the
batter and bake in a preheated 325-degree oven for 20 minutes or
until cake is done. Turn cake out onto kitchen towel that has been
sprinkled with powdered sugar. Carefully roll up the cake inside the
towel and let cool. Unroll; arrange fresh or thawed strawberries over
cake. Spread with the one cup of whipped, sweetened cream. Roll up
again and chill. Leave as is or frost with a butter cream frosting
and decorate with additional strawberries.
