Can
1/2 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Sugar
2 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Light corn syrup
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 lg Eggs
1 tb Lemon juice
3 oz Cream cheese -- softened
1/2 c  Sour cream
Candied citrus peel -- * see
Note
* Make candied orange peel for cooking purposes by shredding the peel
of an orange into very thin strips. Avoid getting any of the white
pith below the peel. Mix 1/2 cup water and 1 cup sugar in a saucepan.
Bring to a boil and add the orange peel. Boil for 5-10 minutes,
stirring often to prevent sticking. Let cool in pan, then remove peel
from syrup to drain and dry on waxed paper. You can freeze orange
peel after cooling for future recipe use. This is not as sweet as
regular candied orange peel, but works well for cooking purposes.

PIE CRUST: 1. Combine flour with salt. Cut in shortening with pastry
cutter until mixture is like coarse cornmeal. Sprinkle with 6-7
tablespoons of syrup drained from peaches while tossing mixture with
a large fork until mixture holds together. 2. Divide dough into 2
parts. Roll out one part on lightly floured surface, 1-2 inches
larger than an inverted 9-inch pie plate. Fit dough into plate and
flute edges. Roll second half of dough and cut into shapes with
cookie cutters or glass dipped into flour. Leave on pastry board
while preparing filling.

FILLING: 3. Drain peaches and cut into slices, reserving syrup.
Combine slices with 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, corn syrup, cinnamon,
vanilla and cooled candied orange peel (2-3 tablespoons). Put mixture
into pie crust and dot with margarine.

TOPPING: 4. Place in small saucepan the eggs which have been beaten
slightly, add 1/3 cup sugar, lemon juice and 2 tablespoons peach
syrup. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick. 5. Combine
softened cream cheese with the sour cream. Add the hot mixture to
this and beat until smooth. Spread over the peach filling. 6. Place
the cut-outs of pastry on top of pie and bake in preheated 425-degree
oven for 10 minutes. Cover edges of pastry with foil; bake at 350
degrees for 30-35 minutes longer or until crust is deep golden brown.
