Julie Herron of Salem, Ohio, uses her mother's recipe for her angel
food cake. It won Julie a blue ribbon at Ohio's Canfield Fair.

1. Allow egg whites to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

2. Sift together powdered sugar and flour; set aside.

3. In a large mixing bowl, beat whites, cream of tartar and salt till
foamy.

4. Gradually add granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating
on high speed till stiff peaks form.

5. Quickly beat in vanilla and almond extract. Sprinkle flour-sugar
mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, over beaten egg whites, folding in gently
just till flour-sugar mixture disappears.

6. Push batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Gently cut through
batter with a knife or spatula to remove large air pockets.

7. Bake in a 375-F oven for 35 to 40 minutes or till top springs back
when touched lightly with your finger. Invert cake in pan on a funnel
and let the cake hang till completely cool. Loosen the sides of the
cake with a narrow-bladed spatula or knife; remove cake from pan.

Makes 12 servings.

Note: For easy entertaining, serve fresh fruit and fruit sauce over
the cake. Source: Midwest Living, August 1995
