1    One-inch piece dried
-tangerine peel (optional)
2 tb Salted black beans
1 ts Peeled, minced fresh ginger

-sauce or:
2 tb Light soy sauce
1 tb Rice wine
1 ts Sesame oil
1 sm Red or green chile pepper,

1    Green onion, chopped
Cut ribs between the bones into 1-inch pieces. Trim off excess fat.
Put ribs into a mixing bowl.

Soak the optional tangerine peel in hot water for 10 minutes. Drain,
finely mince and set aside.

Rinse the black beans with warm water; drain. Gently mash the beans,
ginger, garlic, salt and sugar into a paste. Stir in the tangerine
peel, soy sauces, wine sesame oil and chile pepper. Pour over the
spareribs and mix well. Transfer to a shallow, 9-inch, heat-proof
plate (a glass pie plate is perfect) and refrigerate for at least 30
minutes.

Let the plate of ribs come to room temperature. Place in the steamer,
cover and steam over boiling water (medium-high heat) for 45 minutes.
Check water level frequently and replenish with boiling water when
needed.

Serves 4 as part of a multi entree Chinese meal.
