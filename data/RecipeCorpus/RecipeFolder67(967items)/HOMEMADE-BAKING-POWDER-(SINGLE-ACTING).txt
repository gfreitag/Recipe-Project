Title: HOMEMADE BAKING POWDER (SINGLE ACTING)
Categories: Digest, Dec.
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Measure cream of tarter
1    Measure baking soda
Mix together and use immediately. If you want to mix ahead of time and
store no longer than one month, add
1    measure cornstarch

Note:  I use teaspoons for measure amount, but it really depends on
how much you need. The cornstarch will help keep the other
ingredients from absorbing moisture (this is what is used in
manufactured baking powder). If you have a recipe that calls for
double acting baking powder, just use twice the amount.

Oh, one more thing, to check and see if the baking powder in your
pantry is still active, stir 1 teaspoon into one-third cup hot water.
There should be immediate vigorous bubbling. If no bubbling or
bubbling is sporadic, the baking powder is past its prime.

Homemade baking powder starts to fizz and release carbon dioxide the
minute it is added to liquid, it is very important that the oven be
preheated and baking pans be ready before mixing batter. Mix quickly
and put in oven right away.
