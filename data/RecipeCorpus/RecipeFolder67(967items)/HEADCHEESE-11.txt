Title: HEADCHEESE 11
Categories: Meats
Yield: 6 Servings
3    Pork hocks
1 lg Onion
2 qt Water or to cover
2 ts Salt or to taste
1/2 ts Sage
Wash pork hocks and put in large pot, cover with water and add salt
and pepper and the onion whole. Boil slowly until hocks are well
cooked, remove from water and cool a bit then remove meat from bones.
Put meat in blender and puree or cut fine with two knives. Put meat
in a bowl and add about the same amount of water the hocks were
cooked in and add the sage and more salt and pepper if needed. Taste
for seasoning adjustment. Divide into small containers or leave in
bowl. Very Good. This recipe is Dot Howes', a farm lady who has been
making it and selling it at Boyce's Farmer's Market in Fredericton,
N.B. for over 30 years.
