Title: HOLIDAY BAKED OYSTERS
Categories: Seafood, Holiday
Yield: 6 Servings
INGREDIENTS:
4 c  Firm white bread (Italian or
-French or sourdough)
1/2 c  Butter
Salt and cayenne pepper
1 pt Raw oysters, well-drained
1 tb Lemon juice
1 sm Onion, grated
1/2 c  Whipping cream
paprika (TIP:) This dish can be made with oysters of *any* size. While
fresh ones ARE best,  thawed, frozen oysters *may* be used. If you
wish, prepare  the dish and refrigerate it for several hours before
baking. Or, on  the  other hand,  you can cut and brown the bread
cubes ahead of time. The rest can be finished in minutes, once the
bread is browned.

Remove the crusts from the bread.  Cut the bread into quarter-inch
cubes; in a large skillet, melt half the butter. Add 2 cups of bread
cubes and toss  over LOW HEAT until they're golden-brown. Sprinkle
the cubes lightly with salt and caynne, stirring constantly.

Brown the remaining cubes in the remaining butter. Sprinkle again
with the cayenne and the salt.

Cover  the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish with 1/3 of the bread
cubes; top the bread evenly with half the oysters, sprinkle with salt
and cayenne, half the lemon juice and half the onion. Cover with 1/3
of the bread cubes and sprinkle with salt,  cayenne, the rest of the
lemon juice and the onion.  Pour in the cream, and top with the last
third of the bread cubes. Sprinkle with paprika to make pretty.

Bake at 325 degrees for 25 to 35 minutes and serve *immediately*.
