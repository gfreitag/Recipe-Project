Title: HERBED TURKEY ROAST
Categories: Poultry, Casseroles
Yield: 10 Servings
5 lb Whole turkey breast, boned
1/4 c  Parsley, chopped
2 tb Fresh thyme, minced
Salt
Pepper
2 oz Fontina cheese, sliced
2 oz Prosciutto
4    Sprigs of parsley or thyme
2/3 c  Chicken broth
1/3 c  Dry white wine
2 tb Cornstarch
2 tb Cold water
Rinse turkey, pat dry, and place, skin down, on a board. Sprinkle
meat side with chopped parsley and thyme, season with salt and
pepper. Cover with cheese and prosciutto, overlapping slices.
Starting with a long edge, roll up turkey firmly, jelly roll style.
Overlap 3-4 sprigs down length of roll; tie roll securely with string
at 2" intervals. (At this point, you may cover and refridgerate until
next day.)

Place turkey, thyme side up, in slow cooker.  Pour in broth and wine.
cover and cook until meat in thickest part is very tender when
pierced (9-10 hours).

Carefully lift turkey to a warm platter and keep warm. Skim and
discard fat from cooking liquid; blend in cornstarch (blended with
water). Increase cooker to HIGH; cover and cook, stirring 2 or 3
times, until sauce is thickened.

Remove and discard strings and thyme sprigs from turkey; slice meat
1/4" thick.  Garnish with additional thyme sprigs, if desired. Serve
with sauce.
