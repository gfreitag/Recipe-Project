Title: HEARTY PORTUGUESE KALE SOUP
Categories: Meats, Soups, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 lb Smoked sausage
-- sliced 1/2" thick
1 qt Chicken broth
1 md Onion, thinly sliced
3 md Potatoes, sliced
1 lg Bunch (abt. 1 lb.) kale
-- shredded or
-- sliced very thinly
Freshly ground black pepper
Salt (opt'l.)
Heat oil in a skillet; saute the sausage just until the fat is
rendered, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and reserve.

Bring broth to a boil with the onions and potatoes; simmer 10 to 15
minutes until potatoes are very tender. Mash onions and potatoes in
the broth with a potato masher or slotted spoon. Add drained sausage
slices and the kale. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 3 to 5
minutes, until kale is tender. Taste for seasoning - depending on how
spicy your sausage is, add salt and pepper to taste.  Serve piping
hot.

Shepherd writes: "For a cold night, serve with a warm crusty bread
and good beer or red wine for a complete meal."
