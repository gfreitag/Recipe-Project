Title: HERBFARM ROSEMARY SHORTBREAD
Categories: Cookies, Desserts, Harned 1994, Herb/spice
Yield: 36 Cookies
1 1/2 c  Unsalted butter (3 sticks)
-- at room temperature
2/3 c  Sugar
2 tb Fresh rosemary or
2 ts Dried rosemary
2 1/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 c  White or brown rice flour
1/4 ts Salt
2 ts Sugar for topping (opt'l.)
Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

Cream butter in a large bowl until pale yellow and light. Add the
sugar; continue mixing until the mixture is fluffy.

If you are using fresh rosemary, mince it.  If you are using dried
rosemary, crush it in a mortar and pestle, or by using a rolling pin
on a flat surface, until it is fine but not a powder.

Add both flours, the salt and the rosemary to the butter mixture; mix
until thoroughly combined.  The dough will be somewhat soft.
Refrigerate it for 1 hour, if necessary, so that it is firm enough to
roll.

Roll the dough out to form a rectangle about 10 x 14" and 1/4" thick.
Cut cookies into 1 1/2 x 2" rectangles or any other shape you like.
Place them about 1/2" apart on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle
them with the sugar topping if desired; bake at 375 F. in the center
of the oven until they are gold at the edges, 12 to 15 minutes.

Remove the cookies from the oven and transfer them to wire racks to
cool. Pack in an airtight container. The cookies will keep, their
flavor improving, for at least a week.

Note:  The author says that these cookies are much better two days
after they are baked, and suggests planning accordingly.
