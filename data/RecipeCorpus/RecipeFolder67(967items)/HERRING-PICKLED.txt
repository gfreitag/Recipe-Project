Title: HERRING PICKLED
Categories: Fish/shellf, Pickle/reli
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Schmaltz herring
2    Onions
1 c  Vinegar
1/2 c  Water
3 tb Sugar (to taste)
1 c  Sour cream
1 tb Whole pickling spice
(optional)
Soak herring whole overnight. Remove skins and entrails. Filet
herring and cut into pieces; or cut into slices through bone. Place
herring in jar in layers alternating with sliced onions. Combine
vinegar, water, sugar and sour cream. Pour over herring. Store in
refrigerator for a day or two before serving.

If you like it sweeter, add more sugar; sour, add vinegar. If you
wish, omit sour cream in the pickling liquid. Instead, add it to the
drained, pickled herring when ready to serve. A tbs of whole pickling
spice added to the marinade adds zest.
