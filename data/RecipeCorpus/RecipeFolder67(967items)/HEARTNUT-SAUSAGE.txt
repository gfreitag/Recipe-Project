Categories: Sausage, Nuts, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Batch
1 c  White bread crumbs
1/4 c  Softened margarine
1 c  Cooked rice
1 1/2 c  Chopped heartnuts (Juglans
- sieboldiana cordiformis)
2    Eggs, beaten
1/4 ts Celery salt
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1/2 ts Dry, crumbled sage
1/4 ts Dried thyme
3 tb Parsley, fresh or dried
2 tb Finely grated onions
1/2 ts Black pepper
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl, tossing together to blend
thoroughly.  Form into round patties, not too tightly packed. Fry
quickly in hot oil on both sides so a light crust is formed. Reduce
heat and cook about eight minutes or until done, turning once. Serve
with a warm cheese sauce.
