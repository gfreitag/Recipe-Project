Ready-made puff pastry is the secret to preparing these appetizers
fast. They look fussy, but actually bake only minutes to prepare.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Roll pastry on lightly floured surface
to 13x13-inch square.  Cut into shapes with cookie cutters (simple
shaped cutters work best). Place on ungreased baking sheets.

Brush cut-outs lightly with oil.  Decorate with desired toppings.

Bake 6 to 8 minutes or until golden. Seve warm or at room temperature.
