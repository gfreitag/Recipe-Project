Title: HERSHEY'S FUDGE CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 1 Servings
1 3/4 c  Unbleached Flour, Unsifted
1 ts Baking Powder
1 ts Baking Soda
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Vegetable Shortening Or
Vegetable Oil
1 1/2 c  Sugar
2 lg Eggs
1 ts Vanilla Extract
2/3 c  Cocoa (Less if using Dutch
Process)
1/4 c  PLUS 2 to 3 Tbls Hot Water
1 c  Milk Mixed With 1 Tbls
Water (To Make Sour Milk)
This has been one of the most popular cakes Hershey has ever
introduced. I have made it since the 1950's so I would consider it a
classic. Grease the bottoms and sides of two 9 X 1 1/2-inch layer
cake pans and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, blending
well, and set aside.  Cream the shortening and sugar, with an
electric mixer set on high, and beat in the eggs and vanilla extract
and continue beating until light and fluffy.  Blend the cocoa into
the hot water to make a smooth paste. Gradually add the cocoa mixture
to the creamed mixture, stirring to blend well.  Add the flour
mixture alternately with the milk to the creamed mixture, beating
well after each addition. Pour the batter into the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the tops
spring back when lightly pressed. Cool on racks for 10 minutes and
remove from the pans to cool completely. Frost with
Chocolate-Buttercream Frosting (Next Recipe).
