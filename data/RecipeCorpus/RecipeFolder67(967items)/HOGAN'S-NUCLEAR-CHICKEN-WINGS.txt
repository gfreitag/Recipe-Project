Categories: Poultry, Appetizers
Yield: 2 Servings
24 ea Chicken Wings, Separated
2 tb Vegetable Oil

3 tb Habanero Sauce
3 tb Tabasco Sauce

1 tb White Vinegar
1/4 c  Brown Sugar

These chicken wings are quite easy to prepare. Adjust the amount of
Tabasco sauce and Habanero sauce to your own tastes. I recommend
though that you just cool them by dipping them in the bleu cheese
salad dressing rather than decreasing the hot sauces. þ Preheat oven
to 375øF. þ In a medium sized mixing bowl combine vegetable oil,
garlic powder,
Tabasco sauce, habanero sauce, vinegar and brown sugar. þ Separate
tips from wings. þ Place tips and wings on cookie sheet(s). þ Using a
pastry brush, coat the wings with the sauce mixture. þ Sprinkle
ground red pepper over wings and tips. þ Bake wings for 15 to 20
minutes or until browning has occurred. þ Arrange wings on leaf
lettuce and serve with your favorite beverage. þ Dip wings in bleu
cheese salad dressing for some cooling affect. NOTE: These wings can
also be cooked on the barbeque. Wings should be
grilled for the same amount of time over medium high heat coals.
