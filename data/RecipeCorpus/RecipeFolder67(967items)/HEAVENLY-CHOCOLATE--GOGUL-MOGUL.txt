Title: HEAVENLY CHOCOLATE--GOGUL MOGUL
Categories: Desert
Yield: 8 Servings
2    Eggs (separated)
1 c  Confectioners' sugar
1/3 ts Salt
2    Or 3 drops vanilla
1/3 ts Cream of tartar
Cocoa according to pkg
-instructions
Prepare cocoa according to package instructions.  Have eggs at room
temperature.  Add salt and cream of tartar to egg whites and beat
until mixture forms rounding peaks. Beat in 1/2 cup sugar, a
tablespoon at a time and continue beating until the sugar is
dissolved and the mixture forms glossy pointed peaks (takes about 10
minutes). Add the vanilla and continue beating 2 to 3 minutes longer.

Beat the egg yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, a tablespoon at a
time, until its heavy and thick enough to float on top of the cocoa.
(This will also require about 10 minutes of beating time.) Place the
yolk mixture on top of the cocoa and top with the egg white mixture.
You will need to use a spoon first before you can drink this. On a
cold wintry night it is suggest you might wish to add some cognac to
the cocoa.

I might also suggest dusting the top of the egg white with nutmeg or
cinnamon.  Elegant!
