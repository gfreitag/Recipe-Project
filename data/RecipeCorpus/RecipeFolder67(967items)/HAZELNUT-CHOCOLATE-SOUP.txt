Categories: Soup, Dessert
4 c  half-and-half
Yield: 4 Servings
6 oz semi-sweet chocolate -- or
bittersweet chocolate
:
1/2 c  sugar
4    egg yolks -- at room
temperature
:
1/3 c  creme de cacao

In a saucepan, combine half-and-half, chocolate, and sugar and place
over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the chocolate melts.

Beat the egg yolks in a small bowl, then whisk in about 1/2 cup of the
chocolate mixture. Whisk the egg mixture into the soup and simmer,
stir frequently, until the soup thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in the liqueurs.

To serve hot, ladle into warmed bowls, add a dollop of whipped cream,
sprinkle with the hazelnuts, and serve immediately. Alternatively,
pour a container, tightly cover, and refrigerate for up to 5 days.
Slowly reheat before garnishing and serving.

To serve cold, pour into a container, tightly cover, and refrigerate
until chilled, at least 2 hours or as long as 5 days. Remove from the
refrigerate about 20 minutes before serving. Ladle into chilled bowls
and garnish as for hot soup.

Serves 6 as a brunch soup course or dessert.
