Categories: Meats, Thai
Yield: 2 Servings
1/2 ea Small onion
1 ea Clove garlic,
1 x  Minced fine
1 ea Slice fresh ginger,
1 x  Minced fine
1/8 c  Lime juice (1/2 lime)
1/2 ts Pure chile powder
1/2 lb Chuck steak
1 ea Small carrot
5 ea Fresh green beans

Butterfly chuck steak to less than 1/2 inch thick. Pound very thin.
Grate, or very finely mince onion. Mix with garlic, ginger, juice and
chile powder. Place mixture in non-reactive pan or dish large enough
to hold meat in one layer.  Place meat in mixture and turn to coat.
Set aside to marinate 1 hour at room temperature, or overnight in
fridge.
French-cut the green beans, and cut carrot into thin strips. Broil
meat close to the flame, 2-3 minutes per side. Remove to a platter
and set aside for the juices to settle, 5 to 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, broil the beans, carrot and green onion until limp and
charred in spots, about 5 minutes. Remove and cut into 1 inch
sections.
Arrange lettuce on plates.  Top with meat and vegetables, and
sprinkle with mint. Serve with tortillas and peanut sauce.
