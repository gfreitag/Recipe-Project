NOTES:

*  A delicious appetizer or vegetable dish -- I learned this recipe
from my mother.  I think she originally found it in the _Troy (NY)
Times Record_. Yield:  Serves 12-20.

*  These can be made up ahead of time and frozen.  If frozen, increase
cooking time by 10-15 minutes.

*  Herb stuffing mix is a commercial preparation of bread crumbs and
herbs and seasonings that is packaged for stuffing a turkey or
chicken. You can make your own if you like.

*  This recipe makes about 80 appetizer-size balls, or about 40 larger
balls to use as a vegetable dish at a meal.
