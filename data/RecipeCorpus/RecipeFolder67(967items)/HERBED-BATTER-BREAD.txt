Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Skim milk powder
1 c  Lukewarm water
1 tb Honey
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Lukewarm water
4 ts Dry yeast
3 tb Chopped parsley
2 tb Chopped fresh basil or 1
-tsp. dried, crushed basil
1 tb Freshly-snipped chives
1 ts Dried, crushed oregano
1/2 ts Fresh chopped thyme or 1/4
-tsp. dried thyme leaves
1/2 ts Freshly snipped marjoram or
-1/4 tsp. dried
4 1/2 c  Rye flour
2 tb Oil
Combine skim milk powder and warm water in a small bowl, using a wire
whisk.  Add honey and salt.  In a larger mixing bowl, place the
lukewarm water and sprinkle the yeast over the top, until dissolved.
Add the milk mixture to the dissolved yeast.  Stir in the fresh and
dried herbs. Add two cups of rye flour. Beat for 2 minutes on medium
speed of electric mixer, scraping sides of bowl frequently; or beat
vigorously with a wooden spoon, about 200 strokes, until batter looks
satiny. Using a wooden spoon, blend in the additional two and 1/2
cups of rye flour.

Scrape batter from sides of bowl.  Cover with a clean towel and set
in a warm place (85) away from drafts, to rise until light and
doubled in size--about 45 to 50 minutes. (Do not allow to over rise).
Stir the batter down.  Turn into a well-oiled one and one-half quart
casserole or souffle dish (batter will be sticky. Smooth out top of
loaf by flouring hand and patting into shape.)  Again, allow to rise
in a warm place, covered for 20 minutes.  Preheat oven to 375 F.

Place in preheated oven and bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until bread
is golden brown.  Remove from oven and brush top of bread lightly
with oil. Cool for 10 minutes. Turn bread out onto wire rack to cool.
Yield: One round loaf
