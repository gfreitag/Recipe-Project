Title: HEARTSEASE TEA
Categories: Beverages, Seasonings
Yield: 1 Batch
1 c  Rose hips
1/2 c  Diced dried pitted cherries
1/4 c  Crumbled dried orange peel
2    Cinnamon sticks
-- broken into pieces
1/4 c  Dried unsprayed rose petals
1/4 c  Dried violas
-- (Johnny-jump-ups,
-- pansies, or violets)
The naturally tart taste of this tea may be amended by adding honey or
other sweetener (rose geranium sugar is especially nice).

Mix all the ingredients.  Store in a glass jar with a tight-fitting
lid. Use about a tablespoon per cup and steep for 15 minutes to
release the flavor of rose hips and cherries.
