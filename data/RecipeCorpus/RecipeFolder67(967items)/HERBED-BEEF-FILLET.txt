Title: HERBED BEEF FILLET
Categories: Meats, Main dish, Sauces
Yield: 10 Servings
1    Beef Fillet; About 5 Pounds
1/2 c  (1 Stick) Butter
1 tb Minced Fresh Tarragon; OR
1 ts Dried Tarragon; Crushed
1 tb Minced Fresh Chervil; OR
1 ts Dried Chervil; Crushed
1 tb Minced Shallots Or Scallions
2 tb Dry White Wine
2 tb White Wine Vinegar
Buy a prime fillet, if possible, and fold under and tie the tail to
form a roast of uniform thickness. Melt the butter in a small
saucepan. Stir in the tarragon, chervil, and shallots or scallions.
Cook over very low heat for a minute or two.  Slowly stir in the wine
and vinegar and heat slowly. Place the meat on a tray and brush with
the herbed butter. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour, brushing
with the sauce 2 or 3 times more. Remove the meat from the tray and
pour any sauce remaining on the tray into the saucepan with the
remaining sauce. Brown the fillet over the coals on all sides for
about 10 minutes, watching carefully to prevent any fire flareups.
Move the meat to the edge of the grill or cover the grill and adjust
the dampers to maintain slow steady heat. Grill 15 to 20 minutes
longer or until the fillet is done as desired. Heat the remaining
sauce at the edge of the grill and serve with the sliced fillet.
