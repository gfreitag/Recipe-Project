To toast hazelnuts:

Bake in a 300F. oven, shaking several times, until skins darken,
loosen and crack, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly, transfer to a
towel. Fold towel to encase, rub vigorously to loosen the skins.
Remove and discard as much of the skin as possible.

Transfer skins to blender or food processor. Pulse on/off until finely
chopped.

Crepes: Combine milk, Frangelico, vanilla and almond extracts and eggs
until blended. Add flour al at once and beat until smooth and all of
the flour has been absorbed. Beat in the hazelnuts, butter and sugar.
Cover and refrigerate at least two hours, but preferably overnight.

Return batter to room temperature.

Heat crepe pan until water spits across. Lightly oil and heat until
hot. Remove pan from heat, pour in 1/4 cup batter and swirl quickly
to coat bottom. Return pan to heat.

Cook until crepe is golden brown on bottom; turn and cook other side.
Transfer to plate, separating crepes with waxed paper. Repeat with
remaining batter, oiling pan as needed.

The crepes can be prepared to this point ahead of time. Rewarm by
removing waxed paper, wrapping in tin foil and baking in a preheated
350F. oven on a cookie sheet for about 15 minutes.

Quickly roll warm crepes around small scoops of ice cream. Serve with
one or both of the sauces.
