Title: HIGHLAND OATCAKES
Categories: Breads, Ethnic
Yield: 4 Servings
8 oz Medium oatmeal
1 ts Salt
1/2 oz Dripping or lard
3 tb Hot water (or more)
Sift salt and oatmeal in a roomy bowl.  Put on the gridle or a heavy
frying pan to heat.  Bring the water to the boil with the fat. Pour
into a well in the oatmeal. Work into a stiff dough and cut in half.
Roll out on a floured board to the size of a dinner plate and about
1/8-inch thick. Cut into quarters or farles.

Test the gridle's heat by holding your hand over it. Lay on one of the
quartered rounds.  When the farles are ready, the surface stops
steaming and begins to look dry and white. Turn them and do the other
side. Dry off the oatcakes and lightly brown the edges in a hot oven
or under the grill - they should curl up to the fire to prove that
you have made your own.
