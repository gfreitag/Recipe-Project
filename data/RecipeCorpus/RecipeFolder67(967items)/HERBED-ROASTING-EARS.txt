[Just as the earliest New England settlers depended on corn for
survival, pioneers in the Midwest regarded corn as a critical staple.
When sweet corn was in season, Shaker (and other, -my comment-)
community members ate "roastin' ears" three times daily.)

Blend butter with herbs; spread on corn.  Wrap each ear of corn in 2
to 3 leaves of romaine; place in shallow baking dish. Cover tightly
with foil. Bake at
450    degrees for 20 -25 minutes.
