Categories: Cakes, Chocolate
Yield: 12 Servings
1 1/2 c  Hazelnuts or almonds, ground
2 tb Cornstarch
1 1/2 c  Sugar, fine granulated
8    Egg whites
2 ts Lemon juice
A light, luscious hazelnut meringue cake with chocolate-coffee
filling is a dream dessert after a buffer. To make a taller cake pipe
three 8-inch circles and fill as directed. This looks spectacular but
is harder to cut. Preheat oven to 225F (110C). Line 2 baking sheets
with parchment paper or foil. Draw a 10-inch circle on each sheet.
Turn sheet over so pencil will not come off on meringue. Combine
hazelnut and cornstarch making sure there are no lumps. Place egg
whites in bowl of electric beater and whisk until soft peaks form.
Gradually sprinkle in sugar, beating until stiff peaks form and
mixture is glossy. Beat in lemon juice. Sprindle nut mixture over the
whites and quickly fold in. Either gently spread or pipe meringue
into the two circles. Place in oven and bake for 2 to 2 1/2 hours,
until meringue is dry but not coloured. Cool on baking sheet. Remove
from parchment paper and store at room temperature in an airtight tin
for up to three weeks. MOCHA FILLING: Stir together coffee and Kahlua
until coffee is dissolved. Beat whipping cream until it thickens and
holds its shape. Beat in icing sugar and sifted cocoa. Add coffee
mixture and beat until cream is stiff. Do not overbeat; cream should
be thick and smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use. To assemble,
spread half of cream on one layer. Top with second layer and
remainder of cream. Decorate with chocolate curls, chocolate coated
coffee beans or spread a doily on cream and sifted cocao over.
