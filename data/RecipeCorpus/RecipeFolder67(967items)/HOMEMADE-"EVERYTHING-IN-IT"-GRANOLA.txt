Preheat the oven to 250 degrees. Combine all, or as many of these
ingredients as you can put together, in a huge bowl. You will
probably have use your hands to turn the mixture over until it is
thoroughly combined. Divide between 2 jelly-roll pans and toast in
the preheated oven for 1 hour. Stir the ingredients well every 15
minutes, turning them over to be sure that nothing burns on the
bottom. Remove the pans from the oven and allow the mixture to stand
for about 1 hour until it has cooled completely. Pack into apothecary
jars, old-fashioned candy jars, or other airtight containers. It
keeps indefinitely---or at least 8 weeks, which is quite a long time.
