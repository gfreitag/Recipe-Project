dough in a large buttered bowl. Cover and allow to rise in a warm
place until doubled - about 1-1/4 hours.

When doubled, punch down and turn out onto lightly floured board. Roll
dough 1/2 inch thick and brush with melted butter. Roll up jelly-roll
fashion and slice 1/2 inch thick. Place slices in greased muffin tin
or side by side on baking pan. Cover and let rise again until doubled
~ about 45 minutes.

Bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes.
