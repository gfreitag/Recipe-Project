Title: HERBED SUMMER VEGETABLES
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Batch
1/4 c  Mixed fresh herbs*
-- loosely packed
8 oz Feta cheese
3 tb Olive oil
1 lb Yellow patty-pan squash
-- trimmed, cut vertically
-- in 1/4" thick slices
8 oz Green beans; trimmed
-- cut diagonally
-- in 1/2" pieces
1 lb Tomatoes*; cored
-- coarsely chopped
Salt and pepper; to taste
1/4 c  Fresh dill; loosely packed
*Oregano, basil and chives.

**Ripe tomatoes are essential to this dish, but beyond that, try any
vegetable available.  Loomis also suggests trying asparagus, fava
beans, baby turnips, baby bok choy, scallions or garlic shoots in
this recipe.

Mince mixed herbs.  Crumble the feta cheese in a small bowl, drizzle
it with 2 tb. of olive oil, and stir in the minced herbs until
thoroughly incorporated.  Set aside.

Heat remaining 1 tb. olive oil in a wok or large heavy skillet over
medium-high heat.  When oil is hot but not smoking, add the squash and
cook, stirring constantly, until it begins to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.
Add the beans; toss to mix.  Cook, stirring constantly, until they
begin to turn a vivid green, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook,
stirring constantly, until squash is translucent, beans are bright
green and crisp-tender, and tomatoes have softened, 4 to 5 minutes.
Season with a little salt and a generous amount of pepper. Remove
from heat.

Mince dill and add it to the vegetables, mixing well so that it is
evenly distributed.  Transfer vegetables to a warmed serving platter,
distribute the seasoned feta cheese on top, and serve immediately.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
