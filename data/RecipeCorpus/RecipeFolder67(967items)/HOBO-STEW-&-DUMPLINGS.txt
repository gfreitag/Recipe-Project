HOBO STEW: Brown meat in hot oil.  Add water, Worcestershire sauce,
garlic, onion and seasonings. Simmer for 2 hours, stirring
occasionally to keep from sticking. Add carrots. Continue cooking for
20 to30 minutes or until carrots are done. (Cubed potatoes may be
added at the same time as the carrots, or leftover green beans or
peas during the last 10 minutes of cooking).  Remove meat and
vegetables, thicken liquid for gravy and return meat and vegetables.
DUMPLINGS: Sift flour, salt and baking powder together.  Add milk and
vegetable oil to make soft dough. Drop by spoonfuls over Hobo Stew,
covering top. Cover tightly and steam without lifting lid for 12 to
15 minutes or until dumplings are fluffy. From: Syd's Cookbook.
