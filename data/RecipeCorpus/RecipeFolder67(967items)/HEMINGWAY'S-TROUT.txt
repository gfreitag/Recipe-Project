Title: HEMINGWAY'S TROUT
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
3    Green onions, chopped OR
1/4 c  Freeze-dried chives
1 tb Chopped parsley OR
Dried parsley flakes
2 tb Lemon juice
1/4 ts Pepper
6    Whole cleaned trout
(each about 8 oz.)
Seasoned salt
6    Strips bacon
1/2 c  Baking mix (biscuit mix)
2 tb Yellow cornmeal
Lemon wedges (optional)
Combine green onions, parsley, lemon juice, and pepper. Sprinkle
trout cavities with salt, then spread each with onion mixture.

In a wide frying pan over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp. Remove
bacon from pan and drain.  Leave 2 or 3 TBS. of the drippings in pan
and reserve remaining drippings.

Combine baking mix and cornmeal on a piece of wax paper. Coat trout
on both sides with mixture. Arrange half the trout in pan. Cook,
turning once, until fish is lightly browned and flakes readily when
prodded in thickest portion with a fork.  For a 1-inch thick fish
(measured in thickest portion), allow 10 minutes total - 5 minutes on
each side. (Allow same ratio of thickness to time - 1 inch: 10
minutes - for fish of all thicknesses.)

Cook remaining fish in reserved drippings.  Slip a bacon strip into
cavity of each fish.  Garnish with lemon wedges, if desired. Serves 6.
