Title: HILBEH
Categories: Yemani, Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
1 bn Fresh coriander leaves
1 ts Black peppercorns
1 ts Caraway seeds
4    Black cardamoms (or 8 green)
4    Dried chillies (or to taste)
1    Head of garlic
1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Fenugreek seeds
1 tb Tomato puree
1    Lemon
1 tb Sage
Olive oil
Grind the peppercorns, caraway, cardamom (whole if black, seeds only
if green) and chillies.  Peel and crush the garlic cloves and mix
with the ground spices, salt, sage, tomato puree and juice of the
lemon.

Grind the fenugreek and cover with cold water in a small bowl. Leave
for about 30 mins, it will absorb much of the water, swell and become
gelatinous. Drain. Mix in with the spices.

Chop the coriander and mix with the rest of the ingredients. Blend in
an electric mixer, adding oil as necessary to achieve a blendable
consistency.
