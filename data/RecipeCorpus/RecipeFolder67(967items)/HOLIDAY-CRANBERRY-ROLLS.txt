Soften the yeast in the warm water.  Combine the flours, sugar and
salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in the margarine until the mixture
resembles crumbs. Add the milk, eggs and softened yeast. Mix well.
Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight.

Meanwhile, make the Cranberry-Orange Filling by combining the
cranberries, orange, brown sugar (or fructose), and applesauce in a
food processor. Grind until coarse. Transfer to a saucepan and cook
over medium heat for 10 minutes.  Cool.

After chilling, roll the dough into an 18- by 12-inch rectangle on a
floured surface. Spread with the filling. Roll up jelly roll fashion.
Cut into 18 rolls with a sharp knife. Place in an oiled 13- by 9-inch
baking pan.  Let rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes, or until
doubled in bulk.  Bake in a 350-degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or
until golden brown.  Glaze with orange juice concentrate while still
warm.
