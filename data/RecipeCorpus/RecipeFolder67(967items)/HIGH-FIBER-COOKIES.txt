Note: These cookies, which provide 2 grams of dietary fiber each,
aren't terribly sweet. We like them this way, but if you prefer them
sweeter, you can add 1 tbsp Weight Watchers dry substitute when
adding the other sugars and this will not change the nutritive
values. Nutritive Value per cookie: CAL 121; CHO 15 gm; PRO 2 gm; FAT
