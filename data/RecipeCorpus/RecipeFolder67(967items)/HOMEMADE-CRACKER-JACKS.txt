1 c  Peanuts
1/2 c  Molasses

A candy thermometer is handy to have for this rcipe to test
:
the temperature of the syrup that binds the popcorn and nuts together.

Mix popcorn and peanuts together in a large bowl or pan.

Cook molasses and sugar together until the mixture reaches a
tempurature of 235 degrees on a candy thermometer. If you don't have
a thermometer, test the syrup by letting some drop from a spoon into
acup of cold water. The syrup is done when it forms a thead as it
drops into the water.

Pour hot syrup mixture over the popcorn nut mixture and stir to coat
evenly.  Cool and break into chunks with a wooden spoon. Stored in an
airtight container, mixture will keep well for 4 th\o 6 weeks.
