1 1/2 c  Flour
1 ts Baking powder
1/4 ts Nutmeg
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 ts Vanilla extract
1 pn Salt
1 c  Oil
2 1/2 ts Water, hot
1/2 ts Baking soda
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
8 oz Cream cheese
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Jam (strawberry,
-apricot or raspberry)
MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
1 c  Whipping cream
2 tb Sugar
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together egg yolks and about 1
cup of the sugar until the yolk color lightens. Stir in carrots,
nuts, flour, baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, salt and oil.
Mix together hot water and soda and stir into flour mixture.

Beat egg whites until foamy.  Gradually add remaining sugar. Beat
until stiff and glossy. Fold egg white mixture into flour mixture.

Turn mixture into a greased pan, 13 x 9-inch, lined with greased wax
paper and bake for 45 minutes or until done. Cool. Slice in half
horizontally, to form two layers.

Make the cream cheese filling:  soften the cream cheese and beat in
the sugar, mixing gradually, until the filling is smooth and fluffy.
A food processor works well for this.

Cover bottom layer with cream cheese filling, then cover cream cheese
layer with jam.  Place the top layer of the cake carefully on top of
the jam.

Make the frosting:  beat the whipping cream until slightly stiff,
then add the sugar and beat the mixture to stiff peaks. Frost the
entire cake with whipped cream.
