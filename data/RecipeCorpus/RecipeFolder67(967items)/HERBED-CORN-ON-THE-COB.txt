cook the corn in the microwave, after spreading the butter on in step

in plastic wrap. Cook (on paper towels in case any butter leaks out)
for 12 to 15 minutes on HIGH, rearranging the corn about half way
through the cooking. Let stand 5 minutes and serve. DO-AHEAD: The
herbed butter for the corn can be made well ahead of time and stored
in the refrigerator or freezer; In fact, you can double or triple the
quantities and keep it on hand, frozen, for anytime you have corn on
the cob.
