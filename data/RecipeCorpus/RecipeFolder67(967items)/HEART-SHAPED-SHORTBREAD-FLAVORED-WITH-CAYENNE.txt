Categories: Appetizers, Cookies
Yield: 10 Servings
Karen Mintzias
1/2 lb Butter, unsalted
-- at room temperature
8 tb Superfine sugar
3 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
Butter and sugar
-- to line molds
Preheat the oven to 350 F.

With a wooden spoon or in an electric mixer, cream together the
butter and sugar until very smooth.

Sift the flour into the butter mixture and, using your fingers, work
all ingredients into a crumbly but very fine mixture. At this point,
add the cayenne pepper, or your choice of other flavorings.

Butter the molds and dust the bottom and sides with sugar. Press the
shortbread dough into the molds.

Bake until golden brown.  The time varies from 10 minutes up,
depending on the size of the mold.  Do not overbake. Cool on racks
before unmolding.

VARIATIONS: To make the more traditional shortbread, you can
substitute a few drops of vanilla extract, 1/4 cup minced candied
citron or lemon peel, or 2 tablespoons ground blanched almonds for
the cayenne pepper.
