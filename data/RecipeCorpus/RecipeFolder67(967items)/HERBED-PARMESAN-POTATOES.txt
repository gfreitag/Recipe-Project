Title: HERBED PARMESAN POTATOES
Categories: Brenda, Cookbooks, Restaurant, Potato, Vegetable
6 TB butter -- melted
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb red potatoes
2 ts dried basil* -- (2 TO 3)
1/4 c  Parmesan cheese -- freshly
grated
:

Cut the potatoes lengthwise into 1/2 inch thick slices. Without
crowding the slices, place on a buttered baking sheet. Brush the tops
of the slices with melted butter and sprinkle with the basil. Top
with Parmesan cheese and a drizzling of melted butter. Bake in a
preheated 375 Fdegree oven for 45 minutes.

*We often use rosemary or another herb, depending on what accompanies
the potatoes.
