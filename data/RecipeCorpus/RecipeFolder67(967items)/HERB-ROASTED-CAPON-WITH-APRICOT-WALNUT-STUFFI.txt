To prepare Dried Apricot-Walnut Stuffing: Slice and cut bread into
1/2-inch cubes and place in shallow roasting pan. Bake about 20
minutes at 350 degrees until slightly dry, stirring twice. Toast
walnuts at same time in shallow pan for 10 minutes, stirring once.

Cook shallots in walnut oil and butter in medium saucepan until
tender but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add wine, apricots, thyme,
sage, salt and pepper. Cover and simmer about 5 minutes. Remove from
heat.

Combine bread cubes, walnuts, wine-shallot mixture, prosciutto,
parsley and egg in very large bowl. Add chicken broth until desired
moistness is attained.

To prepare capon: Just before roasting, stuff capon. Spoon stuffing
loosely into neck cavity, then pull neck skin back and fasten with
small skewer. Lightly spoon stuffing into body cavity. (Bake
remaining stuffing in buttered 1 1/2-quart casserole at 325 degrees
during last 40 to 45 minutes of capon's roasting time.) Tie
drumsticks securely to tail. Twist wing tips under the back.

Place bird breast side up on rack in shallow roasting pan. Combine
walnut oil with butter in small pan and melt over low heat. Stir in
sage, thyme, savory and salt, and cook until herbs wilt slightly.
Brush some mixture over capon. If using meat thermometer, insert it
into one of inside thigh muscles.

Cover capon loosely with foil. Roast at 325 degrees 3 to 3 1/2 hours.
After 2 hours, cut string between drumsticks so thighs cook evenly.
Uncover last 45 minutes, basting occasionally with remaining herb
butter. Continue roasting capon until meat ther- mometer registers
about 180 degrees.

Remove bird from oven and cover with foil. Let bird stand 10 to 15
minutes before carving.

From the Oregonian FOODday, 1/5/93.
