Title: HEMORRHAGING BRAIN
Categories: Beverages, Kooknet
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Shots strawberry schnapps
1/2    Shot Bailey's
1 ds Grenadine
Pour the schnapps into a lowball glass.  Then pour Bailey's right
into the middle and then the grenadine (it's just a dash of red color
to look like blood). If poured correctly the Bailey's clumps together
in the bottom of the glass looking like (you guessed it!) a brain
(sort of). The grenadine is the "hemorrhage."
