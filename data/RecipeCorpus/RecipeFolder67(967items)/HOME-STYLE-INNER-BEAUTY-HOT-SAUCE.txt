Title: HOME-STYLE INNER BEAUTY HOT SAUCE
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
12    Fresh habanero chiles --
Roughly chopped
1    Ripe mango -- peel, pit,
Mash
1 c  Cheap yellow prepared
Mustard
1/4 c  Brown sugar -- packed
1/4 c  White vinegar
1 tb Prepared curry powder
1 tb Ground cumin
1 tb Chili powder
Salt and freshly cracked
Black pepper -- to taste
This style of hot sauce, widely used in the West Indies, is basically
habanero peppers (also known as Scotch Bonnets), fruit, and yellow
mustard, with a few other ingredients thrown in. Use this recipe as a
guideline. Habaneros are at the top of the chile pepper heat scale,
so feel free to substitute other peppers of your choice.

Funnel the sauce into an old pint liquor bottle, then let your
imagination run free as to what whopper you can lay on your guests
regarding its origins. If you're having trouble, here's a start:

"One day in Jamaica I was in this dingy bar and met this old guy
who..." and you take it from there.

Mix all the ingredients together and stand back.  This will keep,
covered and refrigerated, until the year
2018. Be careful, though: If it spills, it will eat a hole in your
refrigerator. If you ever want to dispose of it, call the local toxic
waste specialists.

WARNING: Hottest sauce in North America. Use this to enhance dull and
boring food. Keep away from pets, open flames, unsupervised children,
and bad advice. This is not a toy. This is serious. Stand up
straight, sit right, and stop mumbling.

Be careful not to rub your nose, eyes, or mouth while working with
habaneros.  You may actually want to wear rubber gloves while
chopping and mixing -- these babies are powerful.
