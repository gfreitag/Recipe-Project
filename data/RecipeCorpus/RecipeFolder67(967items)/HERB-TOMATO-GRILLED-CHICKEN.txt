Title: HERB-TOMATO GRILLED CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Bar-b-q
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Chicken, cut-up
1 ds Salt
1 ds Black pepper
MMMMM-----------------------BASTING SAUCE----------------------------
2 tb Oil or melted butter
3/4 c  Tomato ketchup
2 tb Lemon juice
2    Cloves garlic, minced
2 ts Dried basil leaves
Cut off excess fat from chicken pieces.  Loosen skin away from the
meat (this helps the basting sauce to reach the meat underneath).
Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Mix together and blend well
the oil, tomato ketchup, lemon juice, the garlic and basil. Place
chicken pieces on rack. Brush both sides with basting sauce. Grill
chicken for 12 to 15 minutes on one side, brushing with basting sauce
from time to time. Turn chicken over. Brush again with sauce. Grill
chicken for another 12 to 15 minutes or until chicken is done and
juices run clear when pierced with a fork. Serve immediately with
crusty bread and a tossed green salad, tomatoes, and crispy baked
potato wedges.
