Title: HERB BUTTER
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 Batch
2 lb Unsalted butter
- room temperature
2 tb Garlic, chopped
2    Lemons, freshly squeezed
2 tb Parsley, chopped and rinsed
- in a cheesecloth
2 tb Fresh chives, thinly sliced
2 tb Shallots, minced
2 tb Fresh basil, julienned thin
2 tb Fresh thyme, chopped
1/2 ts Salt
In a medium bowl place all of the ingredients and blend them
together. You need to rinse the parsley in a cheesecloth and then
squeeze out the water, because otherwise it will turn the butter
green.
