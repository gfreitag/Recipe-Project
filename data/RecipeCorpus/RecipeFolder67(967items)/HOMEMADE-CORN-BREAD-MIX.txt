1 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Baking powder
2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Shortening that does NOT
Require refrigeration
Stir together flour, cornmeal, dry milk powder, sugar, baking powder,
and salt in an extra large mixing bowl. Cut in shortening with a
pastry blender till mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Store in a
covered airtight container or self-sealing plastic bag for up to 6
weeks at room temperature. (For longer storage, place in freezer
container and seal; store in freezer up to 6 months.  To use, allow
mix to come to room temperature.)

To use mix for corn bread or muffins, lightly spoon into a measuring
cup; level with a straight-edged spatula. Makes 16 cups of mix.

To bake corn bread or muffins:  Grease or spray an 8x8x2-inch baking
pan or 10 2 1/2-inch muffin cups with nonstick spray coating. Place 2
cups Corn Bread Mix in a large mixing bowl. If desired, add 3/4 tsp
dried basil or thyme, crushed; or dried chives, chili powder, or
poultry seasoning. Make a well in the center of the dry mixture.
Combine 1 beaten egg and 3/4 cup water in a small bowl;  add all at
once to mix. Stir just till batter is smooth (do not overbeat). Pour
batter into prepared pan or spoon into prepared muffin cups, filling
each 3/4 full. Bake in a 425 degree over for 20-25 minutes for corn
bread, and about 15 minutes for muffins or till golden brown and a
toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Makes 10 servings
or 10 muffins.

Suggested to give mix as gifts along with baking instructions and
perhaps a fancy muffin pan.
