Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
6 sl Day Old Bread Of Choice
2 tb Butter
Dried Thyme
Fresh Minced Garlic
Lemon Juice
Fresh Chopped Parsley
Trim the crusts from the number of slices of day old bread that you
will need for the meal.  Cut the bread into cubes, the size you want.
Melt butter in a skillet and cook the garlic until tender. Add the
dried thyme and lemon juice.  The amounts of each are to taste. Add
fresh chopped parsley for garnish.  Dip the bread cubes in the butter
mixture and place the cubes on a flat cookie sheet. Place in a
preheated 300Ã¸F oven and allow to dry out for 10 minutes on each
side, turning once. Store in an air tight container until ready to
use. For a variation try adding a little cayenne pepper for a spicy
version.  From: Melinda Lee; KNX Food News Hour, KNX 1070 Radio, Los
