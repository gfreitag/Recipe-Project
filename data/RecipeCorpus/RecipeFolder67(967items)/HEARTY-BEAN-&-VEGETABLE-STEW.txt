Sort and rinse beans, then soak overnight in water. Drain beans and
place in crockpot.  Add vegetable juice, wine, soy sauce, and apple
or pineapple juice. Cover with vegetable stock or water; the amount
added depends on whether you prefer a soup (more liquid) or a stew
(less). The juice adds just a tad of sweetness and the soy sauce adds
depth and the tang of salt. Cook at high for 2 hours.  Add
vegetables, herbs, and spices, and cook for 5-6 hours at low until
carrots and parsnips are tender. When tender, add rice or pasta and
cook for one additional hour. Notes: For beans use 3 or 4 kinds, such
as: black, red kidney, pinto, baby lima, lentil, and green and/or
yellow split peas.
