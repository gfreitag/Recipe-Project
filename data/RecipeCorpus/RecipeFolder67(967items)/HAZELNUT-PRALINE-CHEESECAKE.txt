1/4 c  Amaretti cookie crumbs
About 28 small cookies
1/2 c  Hazelnuts
1/2 c  Sugar -- plus
2 tb Sugar -- divided
1/4 c  Water
2 1/2 c  Cottage cheese, 1% fat
12 oz Light cream cheese
1/2 c  Brown sugar, packed

Temperature
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Coat the bottom of a 10-inch springform
pan with cooking spray; sprinkle with cookie crumbs and set aside.
Place hazelnuts on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Turn nuts
out onto a towel; roll up towel and rub off skins.  Place hazelnuts
in a blender container; cover and process until finely chopped.
Combine 1/2 cup sugar and water in a small saucepan; place over
medium heat. Caramelize by stirring often until sugar melts and is
golden, about 12 minutes. Stir in hazelnuts. Rapidly spread mixture
onto a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Cool completely.
Break into small pieces; place in a blender container.  Cover and
process until finely ground; set aside. Position knife blade in food
processor bowl; add cottage cheese and cream cheese, and process
until smooth. Add brown sugar, Frangelico and 4 egg whites; process
just until smooth.  Pour into a large bowl. Stir in hazelnut mixture,
reserving 1/4 cup. Beat remaining 2 egg whites and cream of tartar at
high speed until foamy.  Gradually add remaining 2 tablespoons sugar,
1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff peaks form. Gently stir
1/4 of egg whites into cheese mixture; gently fold in remaining egg
whites. Pour into prepared pan.  Bake for 35 minutes, or until almost
set. Remove from oven and cool for 15 minutes. Cover and chill for at
least 8 hours; top with reserved hazelnut mixture. (218 calories,
