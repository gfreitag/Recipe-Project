When fresh tomatoes aren't in season, here's a quick way to doctor up
canned tomato sauce. In a Non-Stick VISIONS 1-quart saucepan, heat
olive oil.  Add onion and garlic and saute over medium heat until
onion is pale golden. (DON'T BURN IT!) Add tomato sauce and a
tablespoon of the parsley and cook on medium-low heat about 15
minutes to blend the flavors. Taste. If too acidic, add a teaspoon of
sugar. Add freshly ground pepper to taste and salt, if needed. Finish
by stirring in another tablespoon of parsley and  your choice of
Basil, Oregano, or Marjoram. This sauce came from the cookbook
included with the new CORNING Ware VISIONS Non-Stick 1-quart Sauce
Pan.
