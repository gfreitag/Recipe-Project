Categories: Jewish, Cheese/eggs, Desserts, Holiday, Ethnic
Yield: 14 Servings
MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
1 c  Milk
2 tb Vegetable oil
1/2 ts Salt
3/4 c  All-purpose flour
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 c  Cottage cheese (16 oz)
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Unsalted butter; melted
1 ts Vanilla
3/4 ts Salt
3    Large eggs
Unsalted butter; melted
1    Egg; lightly beaten
To make batter, put the eggs, milk, oil, and salt in a blender
container. Blend well. Add the flour and blend until just combined,
scraping down the sides once.
Brush and 8-inch frying pan with melted butter.  Pour in 2 to 3
Tbsp. of batter, tilting the pan so the batter flows to coat the
bottom. Use just enough batter to make a thin pancake. Cook until the
edges begin to turn golden.  Shake the pan to loosen the pancake.
Quickly turn the pancake out onto a paper towel, browned side up.
Repeat with the remaining butter and batter, stacking the cooked
pancakes between sheets of paper towel. Combine all the ingredients
for the filling in a mixing bowl. Arrange a pancake, browned side up,
and place a  heaping spoonful of filling just above the center.  Fold
the sides toward the middle, overlapping the edges. Fold down the top
to seal in the filling, then roll the pancake to make a neat little
packet. Arrange the blintzes, seam side down, on a heated griddle or
in a large skillet brushed with butter. Cook until browned, turning
once. Makes 14 to 18 blintzes. From The Brooklyn Cookbook by
