3/4 c  Milk
1/2 ts Ground ginger

This spicy pumpkin pie can be made a day ahead and kept, lightly
covered, at room temperature until serving time.  To serve in the
Pleasant Hill (a Shaker Village in Kentucky featured in the article)
style, accompany with a bowl of whipped cream.  Make Flaky Pie Crust.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat milk in small heavy saucepan over
medium heat until small bubbles form around edges of pan; remove from
heat. Beat eggs lightly in large bowl until frothy.  Add scalded milk
in thin steady stream, stirring constantly; stir in remaining
ingredients except for cream.  Whisk until thoroughly blended.  Pour
filling into prepared crust; bake until center is firm and small
knife inserted in center of pie is withdrawn clean, about 45 minutes.
Cool completely on wire rack. At serving time, beat cream in chilled
small mixer bowl with chilled beaters until soft peaks form. Transfer
to serving bowl and serve with pie. TIP: *For fresh pumpkin puree,
split a medium pumpkin crosswise; remove and discard seeds and
fibers. Place pumpkin, cut side down, on lightly greased baking
sheet; bake in 325 degrees F oven until tender when pierced with
knife, about 1 hour. Scrape pulp away from skin; discard skin.  Place
pulp in blender or food processor fitted with metal blade; process in
batches, until smooth. Force puree through coarse sieve. Measure 1.25
cups puree for recipe; reserve remainder for other purpose.  Pumpkin
puree can be frozen, tightly covered, up to 6 months. If using canned
pumpkin, use solid-pack, unsweetened. FROM: "Shaker Thanksgiving",
