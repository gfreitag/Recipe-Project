To broil tomatoes:

Many Mexican recipes call for tomatoes to be asodos (roasted).
Traditionally they are put onto a hot comal and cooked until the skin
is wrinkled and brown and the flesh is soft right through -- this
takes about 20 to 25 minutes for an 8-ounce tomato. However, since
this method is very messy, it is best to line a shallow metal pan
with foil and put the tomatoes in it. Place them under a hot broiler
~- do not have the flame too high or the tomato will burn without
cooking through -- and turn them from time to time so that they cook
through evenly -- the skin will be blistered and charred. A medium
tomato will take about 20 minutes. Blend the tomato, skin, core, and
seeds to a fairly smooth sauce. The skin and core give both body and
flavor to the sauce. And never mind if the skin is charred: that adds
character, too. If the skin is very badly blackened and hard in
places, then remove a little of it. This method of cooking tomatoes
makes for a very rich-flavored sauce.

Heat the oil, add the blended tomatoes and salt, and cook over a
medium flame for about 8 minutes until it has thickened and is well
seasoned.
