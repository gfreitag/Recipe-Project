Title: SEVEN VEGETABLE COUSCOUS
Categories: Digest, Oct.
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Couscous
1 ts Turmeric
2 md Onions, chopped
1 c  Finely shredded cabbage
1 md Turnip, peeled and diced
1 md Yellow summer squash,
Chopped in 1/4" pieces
1 1/2 c  Cooked garbanzo beans
1 1/2 c  Diced ripe tomatoes
1 ts Freshly grated ginger root
1/2 ts Each: ground cumin,
Coriander, turmeric
x  Water as needed
Prepare couscous according to package, stirring in couscous when you
fluff it. Or try substituting brown rice. I was out of couscous last
week, so I used brown rice with turmeric and it was wonderful! Saute
onions until tender in a large saucepan or soup pot using your
favorite oil substitute. Add remaining ingredients except water.
Cover and reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 to
20 min. Add water as needed to produce a moist, but not soupy stew.
Serve over couscous or brown rice.

To make some of this easier, I used canned chickpeas. You could
probably use canned tomatoes as well.  One ingredient I wouldn't dare
leave out is the fresh ginger root !! I store my ginger root in the
freezer wrapped in plastic.  When I want to use some, I take out a
chunk, peel as much as I want to use and grate, it grates much easier
when frozen.
