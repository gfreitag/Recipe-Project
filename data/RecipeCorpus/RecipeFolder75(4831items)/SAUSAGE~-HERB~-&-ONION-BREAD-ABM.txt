Title: SAUSAGE~ HERB~ & ONION BREAD ABM
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Ounces
MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
6 oz Italian sausage
1 md Onions; minced
2 1/4 ts Yeast
3 c  Bread flour
3/8 c  Wheat bran
1 1/2 tb Sugar
1/2 tb Salt
1 1/2 tb Parmesan, grated
3/4 ts Thyme leaves
3/4 ts Rosemary leaves
3/4 ts Oregano leaves
3/4 ts Basil leaves
1 1/8 c  Water; warm
Remove casing from sausage and crumble meat into medium nonstick
skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring to break up sausage, until
it begins to render its juices, about 3 minutes. Add onion and cook
until sausage is no longer pink and onion softens, about 5 minutes.
Remove from heat and let cool.

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

Serve this moist, spicy bread with a crisp green salad or with
vegetable soup for a casual apres-ski party. The only other thing you
need is beer or a hearty red wine.
