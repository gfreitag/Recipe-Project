to slash duck from breast to lower belly. Don't cut through bone.

mushrooms, orange peel, bamboo shotts, anise, 1 tsp. salt,
sugar,pepper,& MSG. Distribute evenly. Place on platter,elevate in a
steamer. Cover, steam for 2-1/2 hrs. Make sure water is replenished
as it evaporates. Remove platter, allow duck to cool. Discard all
ingredients except bamboo shoots & mushrooms. Save all juices for
gravy. Carefully remove wings & legs. Gently separate flesh from
carcass w/hands.,starting from slash & keeping skin intact. Be sure
not to make any more holes in skin,& to keep bird in its natural
shape.(Carcass will make good soup.) Spread duck,meat side up, on a
deep platter. De-bone the legs, place w/wings. Spread mushrooms &
bamboo shoots on duck meat. Replace in steaming utensil & steam again
