Categories: New import
Yield: 4 Servings
2    (1 pound) smoked turkey
Wings, chopped into
Lg pieces
2 c  Water
1 lb Collard greens (see note)
1 lb Turnip greens
1 lb Dark curly kale
3 c  Beef broth
1 tb Cider vinegar
1 ts Granulated sugar
1/8 ts Crushed hot red pepper
Flakes, or to taste
In a 5 quart soup pan, bring turkey wings and water to a boil over
high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour.
In a large sink of lukewarm water, agitate collard and turnip greens
and kale to remove any hidden grit. Carefully lift greens out of the
water and transfer to a colander. In a sink of fresh water, repeat
procedure until greens are grit free. Discard thick stems; chop
greens coarsely. Increase heat under turkey wings to medium high; add
one third of greens to the pot. Cover and let the greens wilt, about
5 minutes; stir greens down. Repeat with 2 more batches until all the
greens fit into the pot. Stir in broth, vinegar, sugar and red pepper
flakes and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and partially
cover. Cool, stirring occasionally, until greens are very tender,
about l hour. Leave turkey wing chunks as they are, or remove turkey
meat from the bones and skin, chop meat coarsely and return to
greens. Using a slotted spoon, transfer greens and turkey to a
serving bowl. Use pot liquor as a dip for hot corn bread. Makes 6
servings.

Note: Use any combination of available fresh greens for the ones
listed.
