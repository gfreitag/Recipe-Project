Title: SIMPLE FRIED CHICKEN
Categories: Chicken, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Assorted chicken pieces
6 tb Butter
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Paprika
1 ts Accent (optional)
1/2 ts Garlic salt
Rinse and dry chicken pieces. Melt the butter in a large skillet.
Place the chicken pieces in the skillet and fry slowly until they are
evenly browned on both sides. Sprinkle the salt, pepper, paprika,
Accent and garlic salt over the chicken and cover the pan. Continue
to cook over low heat for 35 minutes. During this period, turn the
pieces of chicken frequently to assure even distribution of the
seasonings. If you like your fried chicken crisp, remove the cover 10
minutes before serving. Turn each piece at least once.
