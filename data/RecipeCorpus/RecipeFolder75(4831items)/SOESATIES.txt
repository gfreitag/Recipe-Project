Title: SOESATIES
Categories: Lamb, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Mutton fillet (leg)
2 tb Butter or drippings
2 lg Tablespoons chutney
3    Onions (chopped)
5    Or 6 lemon leaves
1 tb Sugar
1 c  Vinegar (or 1/2 milk)
1 tb Curry powder
Seasoning
Corn flour
Cut the meat into cubes of about 1 1/2 inches of fat and lean. Put
into a basin and season with salt and pepper. Lightly brown the onion
in the butter then add the curry powder, sugar, chutney and vinegar.
Simmer for 5 minutes then pour the sauce over the meat, adding the
lemon leaves. Leave in the sauce overnight, then arrange the meat on
skewers, alternating the lean and the fat.  Drain out of the sauce
and grill over a clear fire. Bring the sauce in which the meat was
marinated to the boil and thicken with a little corn flour that has
been mixed to a paste with cold water. Pour this over the soesaties
and serve very hot with rice and additional chutney if desired.
Soesaties may be fried, but in that case they should be cut into
somewhat larger pieces and should not be placed on skewers. (If there
is not sufficient fat on the mutton, extra should be used.)
