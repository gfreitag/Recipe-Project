Divide sausage into 6 equal portions and flatten into patties large
enough to encase the hard-cooked eggs. Place one egg in the center of
each patty and mold the meat around the egg. Lightly beat the raw egg
in a medium-side bowl. Roll each sausage-encased egg first in beaten

fry the egg for 4 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels and chill until
serving time. <source unknown> posted by DonW1948@aol.com Submitted
