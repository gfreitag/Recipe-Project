Title: SMOKER HONEY-GLAZED BREAST OF TURKEY
Categories: Turkey, Smoker
Yield: 8 Servings
1    Turkey breast, bone-in
1/2 c  Honey
1/4 c  Sherry, dry
1 tb Butter
1/2    Lemon; juiced
1/2 ts Salt
1 ds Liquid Smoke; (opt)
Rinse turkey breast and pat dry.  Heat honey, sherry and butter in a
saucepan.  Remove from heat, stir in lemon juice and salt (and the few
drops of Liquid Smoke). Pour honey mixture (we recommend you cool the
mixture thoroughly first) over turkey breast and let stand, covered,
in refrigerator for 3 to 5 hours (we think overnight is much better,
several days is okay, too, turning at least twice a day). Place
turkey breast on smoker grid and baste.  Baste once again when almost
done. See below for times:

Charcoal Smoker:  Use 7 pounds charcoal, 4 quarts hot water (we make a
portion of this white wine, and put in an onion, a few celery stalks,
a lemon cut in half, a few cloves of garlic and a couple bay leaves),
2 wood sticks (we use about 4 to 6 hickory blocks, soaked for at
least an hour in water), and smoke 3 to 4 hours. (Stop about 1/2 hour
early if you plan to reheat at a later time in the oven; we don't
usually do this, but rather pour hot gravy over the sliced turkey if
we want it warm.)

Electric Smoker:  Use 4 quarts hot water (see recommendations for
charcoal smoker for our suggestions), 2 wood sticks (ditto) and smoke
2-1/2 to
3-1/2    hours.
