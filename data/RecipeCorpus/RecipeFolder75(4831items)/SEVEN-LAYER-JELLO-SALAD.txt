Title: SEVEN LAYER JELLO SALAD
Categories: S, L, D
Yield: 6 -8  4 - 3 oz. Pkgs. Jello (green, orange, yellow and red) 2 envelopes Knox
unflavored gelatin 1 pint sour cream 2 C. milk 1 cup sugar Vanilla

Grease 9 x 13 x 2" dish with Pam or salad oil.

1.   Dissolve 1 pkg. green Jello with 1 cup hot water, add 1/2 cup
cold water. Pour into dish and put into refrigerator to set. 2. Bring
to boil 2 cups milk; add 1 cup sugar, mix until sugar is dissolved.
3. Dissolve the 2 envelopes of Knox gelatin in 1/2 cup cold water.
Add this to the milk and sugar. 4. Add 2 cups sour cream and 2 tsp.
vanilla to above mixture; blend with an electric mixer until just
blended. When mixture is fairly cool, put 1 1/2 cups on set green
layer. Put back into refrigerator to set. When it is sticky to touch,
it is ready for the next layer. 5. Same as #1, except use orange
Jello. When Jello is cool, add to the white layer and set into
refrigerator until firm. Next--white layer, lemon, white, then red.

It takes each layer about 30-45 minutes to set. Time can be shortened
by making Jello and setting it aside to cool so that it is ready to
put on top of white layer as soon as white layer is firm.
