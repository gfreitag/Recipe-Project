Title: SESAME CORN CHIPS
Categories: Crackers
Yield: 50 Servings
1 1/2 c  Corn flour
3/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Sesame seeds, toasted
1 tb Oil
1 1/2 ts Soy sauce or Tamari
1 c  Water
Salt for the tops (opt.)
"Set these Sesame Corn Chips next to a bowl of homemade guacamole for
a surefire hors d'oeurves success. A pitcher of spiced tomato juice
would provide a pleasing addition. 350~F. 18 to 25 minutes Preheat
the oven to 350~F.

Stir together the flours, salt, and toasted sesame seeds in a large
bowl or in the food processor. Add the oil and blend until the
mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the soy sauce and blend in enough
of the water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive
ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll as thin as possible, to about 1/16
inch. Sprinkle with salt if desired and roll over the top of the
dough with the rolling pin to press in the salt. With a sharp knife,
score the dough into 2-inch squares. Prick each square 2 or 3 times
with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 15 minutes. Turn over and continue baking another 32 to 20
minutes. Cool on a wire rack.

These crackers will crisp as they cool. If they are not crisp enough
after cooling, put them back in the oven for a few minutes longer and
allow them to cool again. Yield: 40-50.

VARIATION: Try other roasted seeds, such as poppy seeds.
