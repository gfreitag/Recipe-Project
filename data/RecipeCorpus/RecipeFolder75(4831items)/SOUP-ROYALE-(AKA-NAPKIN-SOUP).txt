tight bag. Place the bag into a soup kettle with the 10 cups of
Chicken and Beef broth. Bring to boil, cover, simmer for 2 hours.
Remove the bag from the broth. Let it cool to room temperature. Untie
the bag, remove the now-hardened mixture from the napkin, and cut

add the cubes, and continue to boil for 10 minutes. Serve piping hot.
