Title: SOFT-SHELL CRABS WITH LEMON & CAPERS
Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------YIELD: 4 SERVINGS--------------------------
2    Lemons
1 c  Flour
1 ts Pepper
1/4 c  Olive oil extra-virgin
8    Soft-shell crabs; cleaned
3 tb Butter, unsalted
5 md Shallots; chopped
1/2 c  Wine, white, dry
2 tb Capers; drained
Using a small sharp knife, peel 1 of the lemons, removing all of the
bitter white pith.  Working over a bowl, cut in between the membranes
to release the sections. Squeeze the juice from the remaining lemon
into the bowl of sections and set aside. Preheat the oven to 250F. On
a large plate, combine the flour with the pepper. In a large
nonreactive nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil
over moderately high heat. Pat the crabs dry with paper towels and
dredge them in the flour. Add 4 of the crabs to the skillet and cook,
turning once, until red and crisp, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer
them to a heatproof platter and place in the oven to keep warm.
Repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and 4 crabs. Add
the butter and shallots to the skillet and cook over moderately high
heat, stirring frequently, until the shallots have softened, 3 to 4
minutes. Increase the heat to high, add the wine and simmer until
reduced by half, about 2 minutes.  Add the reserved lemon sections
and juice and the capers and stir well. Place 2 crabs on each plate
and spoon the sauce on top. Food & Wine, June, 1991
