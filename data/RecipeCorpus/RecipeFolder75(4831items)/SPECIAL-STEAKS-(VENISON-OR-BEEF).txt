Title: SPECIAL STEAKS (VENISON OR BEEF)
Categories: Beef
Yield: 1 Servings
6    Boneless venison chops --
All fat cut off
1 c  White wine
1 cn Cream of mushroom soup,
Condensed
1 sm Onion -- sliced thinly
Spoon of vegetable oil
Brown the venison chops in the oil on the stove.  This is just to
give them color, not to cook them so don't cook too long. Put the
venison in a casserole along with the onion slices. Pour the white
wine on top. It should just barely cover the meat, so add more if you
need. Bake for one hour at 175C (350F). After one hour, mix in the
can of cream of mushroom soup.  Do not add any water. The soup will
probably not mix well, don't worry about it as it will "melt" while
cooking. Bake another hour at 175C (350F).  Very good with wild rice.
