MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
50 g  Butter
2    Eggs
pn Salt
15 g  Sugar
150 g  Yeast
70 g  Water
10 g  Yeast
MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
300 g  Water
150 g  Sugar
Flavoring
Whipped cream and sugar
-fruits (strawbarries,
-raspberry coulis, kiwi,
-mango)
Put yeast in a bit of warm water with a bit of sugar. Let eggs come
to room temperature.

On a clean surface, sift the flour and salt. Make a hole in the
center with your hand, put the eggs and butter inside. Mix the egg
and butter together and add a bit of water. Mix in the remaining
water and sugar, add the yeast, and mix everything together.

Take the dough and begin beating it. It should be very liquidy. Beat
the dough untill it becomes smooth and shiny and doesn't stick to
your finger when you prod it.

Put it in a angel-food cake mold and let rise untill it is about
doubled in size. Bake in oven at 375-390 untill it's done (toothpick
comes out clean).

Boil the sugar and water together, remove once it comes to boil. Add
the flavorings, suggested flavors are: Rum, anise (5 spice powder is
good), and citrus peel or fruit.

When cake has cooled, put the cake on a serving plate and pour the
syrup over it. Repeat untill as much syrup as possible has been
absorbed into the cake.

Pipe whipped cream on in a decorative manner and place fruits on it.
