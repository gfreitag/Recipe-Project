Title: SALSA PICANTE DE CHILE DE ARBOL
Categories: Chile-heads, Salsa, Mexico
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/4 oz Dried chiles de arbol --
(about 40 to 50
Mixed size)
1 1/2 tb Sesame seeds
2 tb Shelled pumpkin seeds
"pepitas"
1/4 ts Cumin seeds (or a generous
1/4 ts Ground)
4 lg Allspice berries (or about
1/8 ts Ground)
2    Cloves -- or a big pinch of
Ground cloves
1 tb Dried oregano
1 ts Salt
2 lg Cloves garlic -- peeled and
Chopped
3/4 c  Cider vinegar
Stem the chiles, then roll them between your thumb and fingers,
pressing gently to loosen the seeds inside. Break in half and shake
out as many seeds as possible, then place in a blender jar. Heat an
ungreased skillet over medium low.  Toast the sesames and
pumpkinseeds separately. Pulverize the cumin alspice and cloves in a
mortar, then add to the blender jar along with the oregano, salt
garlic and vinegar. Blend for several minutes til the mixture is
orange red and quite smooth. Stir in tequila and water to thin (about
a 1/2 or 3/4 cup total). I generally let it sit for another hour and
blend again, spoon into a jar and store in refrigerator. Makes 1 3/4
cups West Central Mexico
