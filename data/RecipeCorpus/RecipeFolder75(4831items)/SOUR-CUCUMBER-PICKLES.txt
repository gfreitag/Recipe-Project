Title: SOUR CUCUMBER PICKLES
Categories: Pickles
Yield: 4 Cups
4 c  Cucumbers (small)
4 ts Sugar
2 ts Canning/pickling salt
2 ts Mustard, dry
1/8 ts Alum
Cider vinegar
Water
Wash cucumbers in cool water and pack into a canning jar big enough
to hold them.  Add sugar, salt, dry mustard and alum. Fill jar about
2/3 full with vinegar.  Fill remaining portion of jar to cover
cucumbers with water. Put lid on jar.

Agitate lightly every day for about a week to mix spices in with
cucumbers. Then put in a cool dark place for about 3 months while the
cucumbers work.

NOTES:

*  The most lip smackin' pickles you ever tasted, this recipe came
from my wife's grandmother.

*  Don't be too impatient to try the pickles.  They taste terrible if
they haven't worked.  Also, you do not have to seal these jars. They
will keep for quite some time if stored in a cool/dark location.

: Difficulty:  easy
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 3 months waiting.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
