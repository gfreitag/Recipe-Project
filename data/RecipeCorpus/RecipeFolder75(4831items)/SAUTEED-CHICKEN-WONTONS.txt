Yield: 4 Servings
9    Scallions
5 oz Boneless chicken thighs
2 ts Tamari or other soy sauce +
-more for serving
Oriental sesame oil
-(optional)
Salt and pepper
1/2 lb Wonton skins
6 tb Peanut oil
1/2 ts Minced fresh ginger
1 tb Sesame seeds
Salt and pepper
CHICKEN-TAMARI FILLING:

For the filling, cut the scallions into thin slices. In a meat
grinder or food processor, grind the meat to a coarse texture, being
careful not to overprocess. Stir in 1/4 of the scallions, 2 teaspoons
tamari, the sesame oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Put about 1 tablespoon
of the filling in the center of a wonton skin. Brush the edges of the
skin with warm water, top with another skin, and press gently around
the filling to seal the edges.  Repeat until all the filling is used.
Slide wontons into boiling water, stirring gently, and cook for 2
minutes. Drain carefully and plunge into cold water to stop cooking.
Drain again. Toss with 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil.

Mince the ginger.  In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the
peanut oil over medium heat.  Add the sesame seeds; cook, stirring
frequently, until just golden, about 1 minute. Stir in the ginger.
Add the remaining scallions and cook until soft, about 2 minutes.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Recipe can be made up to this point several hours ahead.

Cooking and Serving:  Heat 2 more tablespoons of the peanut oil over
medium heat.  Brown the wontons in batches, adding the remaining
peanut oil between additions, or use 2 pans. Cook until both sides
are golden, about 4 minutes total.  Top wontons with the
scallion-sesame mixture. Serve additional tamari on the side for
dipping.
