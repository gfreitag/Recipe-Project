Title: SOURDOUGH SAMS
Categories: Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Active Sourdough Starter
1/2 c  Sugar
2 tb Shortening
2 c  Unbleached Flour
1 ts Baking Powder
1 ea Large Egg
1/2 ts Nutmeg
1/4 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Baking Soda
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Buttermilk or Sour Milk
Sift dry ingredients, stir into liquid, roll out and cut with regular
donut cutter.  Then heat some oil in a deep fryer to 390 degrees F
and fry. Makes about 17 Doughnuts with holes. Just before serving
dust with powdered or cinnamon sugar. NOTE: These doughnuts are
virtually greasless. And if you want you can make several batches at
a time and freeze. They keep well and to me taste after a while in
the freezer. Take out as many as needed and thaw and put sugar on or
eat plain.
