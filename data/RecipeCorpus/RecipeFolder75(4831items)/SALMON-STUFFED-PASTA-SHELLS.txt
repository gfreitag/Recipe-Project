salmon and seafood seasoning. Pour evaporated skim milk into lightly
oiled 9 x 12 x 2-inch baking dish.

Fill each pasta shell with a heaping tablespoon of filling. Arrange
shells in casserole; cover with aluminum foil. Bake at 350 degrees F
for 30 to 35 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.

While shells are baking, melt margarine in small saucepan over medium
heat; stir in flour, salt and pepper. Remove saucepan from heat;
gradually add skim milk, stirring until mixture is smooth. Return to
medium heat; bring to boiling, stirring constantly. Reduce heat,
simmer 1 minute. Remove from heat; stir in dill and lemon juice.

Remove casserole from oven; arrange shells on serving platter. Serve
with dill sauce.
