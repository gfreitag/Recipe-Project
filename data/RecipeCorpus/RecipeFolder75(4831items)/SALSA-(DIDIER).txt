Title: SALSA (DIDIER)
Categories: None
Yield: 1 Servings
28 oz Can tomatoes
1/2 c  Chopped onions
1/2 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 ts Lemon pepper
1/2 ts Dried oregano
1/2 ts Garlic powder
2 1/2 tb Lime juice
2    Diced jalepeno peppers
2    Minced garlic cloves
Mix all ingredients in a bowl and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. The
tomatoes can be regular, italian, pureed, fresh (4-5 of them) or
tomatillos.  I prefer a mixture of fresh and pureed. I also sometimes
add green/yellow/red peppers, green chiles or whatever else I find in
the fridge.  This recipe is a variation of one I found in the Chicago
Tribune. Enjoy Allan Didier
