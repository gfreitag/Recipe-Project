Title: SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN WITH SAUTE BANANAS
Categories: Poultry, Barry
Yield: 4 Servings
1    Jointed roasting chicken
2 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Powdered Cinnamon
4 1/2 tb Flour, seasoned with paprika
-and bay leaf
Vegetable oil for shallow
-frying
2    Not-quite-ripe bananas
5 fl Milk or single cream
Put three tablespoons of the seasoned flour on a plate and reserve the
rest.

Rub the chicken joints with the lemon juice and cinnamon and dip into
the three tablespoons of flour so each piece is well coated.

Put just one-quarter inch of oil into a large frying pan with a lid
and heat the oil until it is just on the point of smoking.

Put in the chicken pieces and brown on all sides, then turn the heat
down. Cover the pan and cook for 20 minutes, turning once. When the
chicken is thoroughly cooked, put it on to a serving dish and keep
warm.

Slice the bananas, dust them lightly with a little of the remaining
seasoned flour and saute quickly in the hot oil. Put them on the dish
with the chicken.

Make corn fritters (separate recipe), make the gravy.

Pour away the oil in the frying pan and add the last tablespoon of
seasoned flour to the pan.

Cook, stirring, until it is brown, then pour in the milk or cream and
stir again to make a smooth gravy.
