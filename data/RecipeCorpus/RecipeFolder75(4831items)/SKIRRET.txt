Title: SKIRRET
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
Skirret; sium sisarum
Skirret is one of the many hardy perenniel vegetables which are
typically grown as annuals. In Scotland it is known as crummock and
in Germany as Zuckewurzel. A member of the carrot and parsley family,
it is cultivated for the bunch of wrinkled, greyish roots that form
from the crown. The roots have a sweet, tender white flesh which,
when cooked like salsify or parsnips, is highly esteemed in oriental
countries.

To prepare skirret for table, simply scrub the roots and cut them into
suitable lengths for cooking. They can be boiled with a bit of salt
and served, like salsify or parsnips, with butter. The roots can be
stewed, braised, baked, batter-fried, or creamed. They are also
delicious when mashed with potatoes or served with a cheese sauce.
Skirret can be grated or chopped and add to salads, or dressed in a
vinegar marinade and served alone as salad. The flavor is described
as very sweet and unusual, making this vegetable a fine ingredient in
stews, curries and soups.
