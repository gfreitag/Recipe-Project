Cook the pasta until almost *al dente*; add the arugula, cook for a
few moments & then drain. Meanwhile, lightly saute the shallots or
garlic in the olive oil. Add the tomatoes. Cook over high heat until
the sauce thickens, then season with the salt & hot pepper flakes or
cayenne. Toss the pasta & arugula with the tomato sauce & serve
immediately. VARIATIONS: Add the arugula to the tomato sauce rather
than the pasta. Use wholewheat pasta instead of spaghetti & broccoli
tops instead of the arugula. This will need more red pepper flakes.
Finish with a sprinkling of fresh herbs such as basil or oregano.
