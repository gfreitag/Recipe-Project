Title: SPAGHETTI SOUBISE
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 2 Servings
2 lg Onions; finely chopped
2 tb Olive oil
75 g  Crme fraiche
-OR thick set yogurt
175 g  Spaghetti
25 g  Parmesan, grated
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
A simple sauce of sweated onions, sweet and soft, goes really well on
spaghetti. Lots of freshly ground black pepper, Parmesan, and some
crme fraiche or yogurt make it a memorable dish.

Cook the onions in the olive oil over a very gentle heat, covered,
for 30 minutes, stirring from time to time until they are soft,
transparent and sweet but not browned. Season with a little salt and
lots of freshly ground black pepper. Cool a little, then stir in the
crme fraiche.

Meanwhile cook the spaghetti 'al dente' and drain it. Pour the sauce
over the top and toss well together. Serve with the grated cheese.
