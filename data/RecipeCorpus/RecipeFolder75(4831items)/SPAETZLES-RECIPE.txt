Title: SPAETZLES RECIPE
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 1 Batch
2/3 c  Water
1 lg Egg slightly beaten
2 1/4 c  Sifted flour

In a bowl, mix the flour, egg, water and salt until well blended.  Let
stand 30 minutes

Spoon half of the batter on a wet board.  With a sharp knife dipped
in hot water, cut off small slices of the dough and drop them
directly into a large kettle of boiling salted water.

The noodles will rise to the surface when cooked.  Drain well in a
colander.

If made ahead, the noodles may be reheated at serving time in butter
in a heavy skillet over medium heat.
