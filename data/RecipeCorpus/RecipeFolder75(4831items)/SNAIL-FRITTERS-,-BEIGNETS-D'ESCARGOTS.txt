Title: SNAIL FRITTERS / BEIGNETS D'ESCARGOTS
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 8 Servings
Canned or cooked snails
Oil for frying
Parsley sprigs to garnish
2    Eggs, separated
1 1/2 c  Flour
2 tb Olive oil
Salt and pepper
1 tb Olive oil
Herbs
Preparation time 1 hour 35 minutes including marinating. Cooking time
8 minutes. Ingredients:
60    Burgundy snails
100 petits-gris snails (canned or freshly cooked)
2    eggs, separated
1 1/2    cups flour
2    Tbsp olive oil
1    Tbsp olive oil First make the batter. Mix the egg yolks
with the flour and olive oil.  Add a little warm water to give a
smooth, creamy consistency. Season and leave to stand. Just before
using, gently fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites. Drain the snails
and marinade for 1 hour in the olive oil and chopped herbs (parsley,
tarragon, chives, and chervil). Drop the snails into the batter by
the handful, then remove them one by one and drop into the hot frying
oil (2 at a time in the case of petits-gris); fry until golden brown,
then drain on paper towels. Serve garnished with fried parsley. White
wines: Cassis, Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence, Saint-Joseph. [From
"Larousse Traditional French Cooking."] Note: I can't figure out how
you can marinade 100 snails with only 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  -
