Title: SAUTEED BROOK TROUT WITH ORANGE
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Rainbow trout fillets
1/4 c  Milk
1/2 c  Flour; for dredging
-Salt
-Freshly ground pepper
1 tb Olive oil
1 cn Mandarin oranges; drained
2 sm Leeks
1/2 ts Thyme
1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
3 tb Vodka
1 tb Butter; softened
Soak the fish briefly in the milk in a flat pan such as a pie pan. In
another pie pan, season the flour with salt and pepper. Remove the
trout from the milk and dredge the fillets in the flour, shaking to
remove excess flour. Saut the trout in the olive oil on medium high
heat in a heavy skillet, 2-3 minutes per side until thoroughly
cooked. Remove and set aside; keep warm. Pour any excess fat from the
skillet. Clean and slice the white parts of the leeks into 1/4"
rings, including only a little of the green section. Place the orange
sections, the leeks, and the thyme in the skillet and toss briefly
just to warm through.  The leeks should not get brown.  Stir in the
lemon juice, vodka, and the soft butter. Reduce heat and blend well.
Place the sauted trout on warm plates and divide the sauce over the
fish portions.  Garnish with fresh basil or parsley. Note: The
original recipe called for 2 Tb. olive oil and 2 tb butter. I cut
both to 1 Tb and it was quite good with half the fat.
