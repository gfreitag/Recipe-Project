1.  To make Salsa:  In small bowl combine avocado, lime juice,
tomatoes,
onion, cilantro, yogurt and chili powder.

2.  To make sandwich:  Toast bread lightly and cover each slice with a
lettuce leaf.

3.  Top with a red pepper ring.

4.  Divide chicken over all.

5.  Cover with avocado salsa.

MENU SUGGESTION:  To complete 1 vegetable card: Accompany with each
serving, 3/4 cup crunchy raw vegetables such as broccoli and
cauliflower flowerettes, carrot and celery sticks.  To complete 1
dairy card: Accompany each serving with 7 ounces ice cold non-fat
milk.

By the way, the rest of the avocado WILL KEEP. Cutting into it isn't a
license to eat the whole thing. Leave the pit in and cover it with
plastic wrap and don't forget, 1/8 avocado = 1 fat card.
