Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
4 c  Unbleached flour
1 ts Salt
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1/4 c  Sugar
1/8 ts Cardamom
1/4 c  Butter
1    Egg, at room temperature
1 3/4 c  Buttermilk, at room
-temperature
1 1/2 c  Currants
Cut this crusty bread in wedges to serve.  Add two teaspoons grate
lemon peel to complement the flavor of the currants.

In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Cut in the butter
with a pastry blender or work it in with your finger. Mix the egg and
buttermilk together and then add this mixture to the dry ingredients.
Stir until well blended.  Add the currants and stir the mixture well.
Turn out on a floured surface and knead gently for 3 minutes or until
the dough is smooth. Divide the dough into two pieces, shaping each
into a round loaf.

Place each in a greased 8 inch cake or pie pan,pressing it down until
the dough fills the pan. Use a sharp knife to cut a 1/2 inch deep
cross on top of each loaf.  Bake in a preheated 375 F oven for about
40 minutes or until the bread sounds hollow when you thump it. Turn
out on a wire rack to cool. Do not cut for about 4 hours. Makes 2
loaves.
