Title: SOURDOUGH RYE STARTER *
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
-Judy Vocelka-NFXS18B
2 c  Rye flour
1 tb Yeast
1 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
Onion slice optional
In a glass or ceramic bowl, or jar that has been scalded, combine
flour and yeast, add water and blend well. Add onion slice, cover
with platic wrap and pierce plastic with fork to release gases. Place
in a warm, draft-free place, at an even 85F for 3 days.; stir several
times daily. Remove onion slice and refrigerate until ready to use.
Onion imparts a strong flavor and this starter can only be used with
compatible rye recipes; rye starter without onion can be used in any
rye sourdough recipe. To replenish, always use rye flour. If starter
does not seem bubbly after replenishing and standing 12 hrs, sprinkle
1 t yeast over and stir in well. Like whole wheat starter, you may
have to plan longer rising times for dough made with this one.
