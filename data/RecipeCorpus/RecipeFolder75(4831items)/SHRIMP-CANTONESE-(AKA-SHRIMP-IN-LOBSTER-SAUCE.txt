Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Shellfish, Loo
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Shrimp, shelled, tailed,
-deveined, rinsed, and
-towel dried
1    Egg white beaten with
1 ts Cornstarch
3 tb Vegetable oil
8 oz Ground pork
4 ts Salted black beans
2 tb Garlic, minced
1 ts Fresh ginger, minced fine
2    Scallions, minced
5 ts Soy sauce
2 tb Dry sherry or rice wine
1/4 ts Sugar
1/2 c  Chicken broth
1 tb Cornstarch dissolved in
2 tb Cold chicken broth
1    Egg beaten with
2 ts Sesame oil
Beat egg white with cornstarch. Add shrimp, mix well, and refrigerate
for at least 15 min or up to an hour. Stir-fry in 3 T oil just until
done. Remove to a warming oven with a slotted spoon.

In the same oil (if it's not too yucky) brown the pork. Add next 8
ingredients. Bring to a boil and add cornstarch-water. Return to the
boil and cook until thickened. Remove pan from heat and stir in the
egg; fuss with the mixture so the egg becomes thin filaments rather
than a big glob in the middle of the pan. Stir in the cooked shrimp
and toss with the sauce. Serve immediately.

You may substitute 1 1-1/2# steamed, cut-up lobster for the shrimp to
make Lobster Cantonese (or Lobster in lobster sauce). This will serve
2-3.
