Title: SOUTH TEXAS OYSTERS
Categories: Appetizers, Seafood, Jaw
Yield: 1 Servings
4    Dozen small oysters, drained
1    12 oz bottle of chili sauce
2 tb Bell peppers, chopped
2 tb Worcestershire sauce
12    Slices bacon, cooked and
Crumbled
3/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
Simmer oysters in a skillet until their edges begin to curl. The
oysters make enough of their own liquid to do this. Drain the oysters
and transfer to glass baking dish. Add chili sauce, bell pepper,
Worcestershire sauce, bacon and cheese. Place in oven 10 minutes
(didn't say what temp. - probably just long enough to melt the
cheese). Serve with toothpicks and toast points (I'm assuming you
DON'T eat the toothpicks ;)
