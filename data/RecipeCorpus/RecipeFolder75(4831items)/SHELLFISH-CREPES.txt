MMMMM--------------------------ASSEMBLY-------------------------------
12    Crepes 6 to 7in in diameter
1/4 c  Swiss cheese grated
2 tb Butter
Creamed shellfish filling
Wine and cheese sauce
To make the Filling: Heat butter to bubbling, stir in the shallots or
scallions, then the shellfish. Toss and stir for one minute. Season
with salt and pepper; add vermouth and boil rapidly until liquid has
almost evaporated. Set aside.

To make the Sauce:  Heat vermouth and boil rapidly until reduced to a
tablespoon. Remove from heat and stir in cornstarch mixture, cream and
seasonings. Put back on heat and simmer for about 2 minutes stirring
constatntly. Blend in the cheese and stir to blend about a minute
more.

To Assemble:  Blend about half the sauce with the shellfish filling.
Place a big spoonful on the lower third of each crepe and roll up
(you can tuck and roll like you would for blintzes) Arrange crepe
close together in a lightly buttered baking dish. Spoon the rest of
the sauce over the crepes and sprinkle with cheese. Dot with butter;
may be refrigerated until ready to bake. Fifteen to twenty minutes
before serving bake in upper third of a preheated 425F oven until
bubbling hot and cheese has browned lightly.

NOTES:  I have also added mushrooms to the filling but watch the water
content, you may have to pour off some of the liquid before adding
cheese sauce.

I also add a dash or two of nutmeg to the cream sauce and use
slightly more cheese than called for. You could also use Gruyere
cheese.

For individual servings bake them two to a serving in individual
gratin dishes. This dish does not reheat well, unless of course it is
just for you then there's no problem:)

This recipe is from my mom who based it on a recipe of Julia Child a
long time ago. Typos by Kim Reese.
