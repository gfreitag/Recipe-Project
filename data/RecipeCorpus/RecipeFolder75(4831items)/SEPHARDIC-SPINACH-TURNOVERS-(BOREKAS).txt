1    Recipe Sephardic spinach

1 lg Egg beaten with 1 tb water
Sesame seeds (opt)
Put the flour in a large bowl or on a pastry board and make a well
in the center.
Place the butter and oil in the well and cut in the fat until the
mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Stir in the vinegar and salt into the ice water. Sprinkle the water,
1 tablespoon at a time, over a section of the flour. Gently mix with
a fork to moisten.
Push the moistened section aside and continue adding enough water to
make a soft dough that just holds together.
Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead briefly with
the heel of your hand.  Form into a ball, flatten slightly, cover
with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes up to 1
week. THe dough can also be frozen for up to 3 months.   Let the
chilled dough stand at room temperature until workable, about 1 hour,
before rolling.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Form the dough into 1-inch dough.  On a lightly floured surface,
roll the balls into 3-inch rounds, about 1/8 inch thick.
Place a heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of each round,
Fold the dough in half over the filling to form a half moon and press
the rounded edge with the tines of a fork to seal. (Turnovers may be
frozen at this point.  Do not defrost before baking; instead,
increase the baking time by about 10 minutes) Place turnovers on a
baking sheet. Brush the tops with egg wash and if desired, sprinkle
with sesame seeds. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve
warm or at room temperature.
