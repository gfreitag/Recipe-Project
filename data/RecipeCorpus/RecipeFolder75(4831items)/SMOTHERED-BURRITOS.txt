SMOTHERED BURRITOS: Heat flour tortilla on grill about 10 seconds;
turn and heat another 10 seconds until hot. Add about 3/4 cup refied
beans; roll. Place on serving plate. Top with Chili Verde and
generous amounts of cheeses, using as desired. Buzz in microwave
about 3 minutes, until cheese is melted. FLOUR TORTILLAS: Mix flour,
baking soda, salt and shortening with hands until thoroughly
combined. Add enough warm water to make a manageable dough (easy to
roll). Pinch off pieces of dough about the size of a biscuit. Roll
into a circle about 1/8-inch thick. Put on heated 300-degree grill
for about 6 seconds; turn and cook another 8 seconds. Repeat with
remaining dough. Makes 24 flour tortillas. Tortillas may be frozen.
Stack between sheets of waxed paper. "When my children were growing
up, I always made the Flour Tortillas in the evening for the next
day. Sometimes I made dessert flour tortillas by decreasing the salt
to 1/2 teaspoon and adding 1/2 teaspoon sugar to the dough. I would
heat them on the grill, then immediately top with cinnamon and sugar
or honey." CHILI VERDE: Roast Anaheim peppers in 350-degree oven
about 15 minutes; turn and roast an additional 15 minutes.  Remove
from oven; cool. (The peppers may be frozen at this point.) To peel
roasted Anaheims, steam a few minutes; cool as needed, then peel and
dice. Add 2 cups water; set aside. In a large skillet, cook pork (or
beef) in melted shortening until browned and completely cooked. Add
flour, garlic salt and pepper, blending well. Add Anaheim pepper
mixture; bring to a boil.  Reduce temperature and simmer 10 minutes.
