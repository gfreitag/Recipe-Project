I have a great recipe for a Southern Peach Coffee Cake *** (NRXS76A)
It calls for 2 cups of sliced peaches. I am searching for a good
Southern Peach PIE or  Cobbler recipe because I have a lot of peaches
right now! Here is the recipe for the coffee cake: OK> In mixer bowl,
combine 1/2 cup of the flour, sugar, salt and yeast. Add softened
butter and water to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium speed.
Add egg, vanilla and another 1/2 cup of flour. Beat at high speed 2
minutes. By hand, stir in 3/4 cup flour to make a stiff batter.
Spread in greased 9" square pan. Combine remaining 1/4 cup flour,
brown sugar, butterscotch mix, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cut in 2 T.
butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over cake. Arrange peach slices on
top. Cover and let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled
in bulk, about 1 hour. Bake at 400 for 25 minutes. Cool in pan 10
minutes, remove and cool on wire rack. Drizzle top with glaze make
with powdered sugar, milk and 1/4 tsp vanilla. Makes one cake, but I
like to say it actually FEEDS one...ME!!!! FROM: JANET MEYER (NRXS76A)
