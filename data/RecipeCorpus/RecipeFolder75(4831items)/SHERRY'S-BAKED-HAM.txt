Recipe by: Sherry L Coutant <FTSLC@AURORA.ALASKA.EDU> * 1/2 can for a
1/2 ham

Open ham package. Remove all paper, plastic, etc. Score ham by
cutting diagonal slashes all over ham rind. This will produce diamond
shaped cuts. Take a toothpick and poke a hole in the center of each
diamond. Then insert a clove in each hole. Open pineapple can. Drain
juice into a small bowl and reserve.  Arrange pineapple slices on top
of ham and secure in place with toothpicks.  To make sauce, add
honey, brown sugar, and mustard to juice. Mix well. Put a tablespoon
of flour in the cooking bag and shake well. Insert a meat thermometer
in the ham. Put ham in cooking bag. Pour juice over ham.  Close bag
and make six small slits. Bake at 350 until meat thermometer reaches
140 degrees.
