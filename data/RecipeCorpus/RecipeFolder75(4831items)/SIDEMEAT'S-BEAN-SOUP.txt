Categories: Soups, Main dish, Beans
Yield: 8 Servings
1 lb Navy beans
1    Ham bone
1 cn Cut up tomatoes (15-16 oz)
1    Onion, chopped
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Bay leaf
Oregano to taste
Soak beans overnight in 8 cups water.  Remember to get the water
upstream from the heard.  Add a meaty ham bone, tomatoes, onion and
celery. Add some salt, pepper, bay leaf and oregano. This here's your
chance to be creative or else use up what's festering in the back of
the pantry. Simmer for 2-4 hours.  Dice the meat, put it back in the
soup, give the bone to your dog. Secret touch of greatness: put about
2 cups of soup in a blender and rile it up 'till its a cloudy liquid
and pour it back in the soup. Let it cook till its the way that suits
you. Ummm boy, now that's good eatin'.
