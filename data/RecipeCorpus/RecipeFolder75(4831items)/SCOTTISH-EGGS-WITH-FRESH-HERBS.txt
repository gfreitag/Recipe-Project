Title: SCOTTISH EGGS WITH FRESH HERBS
Categories: Appetizers, Breakfast, Meats, Eggs
plain flour 8 oz
Yield: 4 Servings  4 lg Eggs
Sausage meat 1 sm Egg, beaten 2 Spring onions, fine chopped
Toasted breadcrumbs 1 ts Finely chopped fresh thyme Salt
:
3 ts Chopped fresh chives Freshly milled black pepper 1 tb Finely
Oil for deep frying
chopped fresh parsley

Hard-boil the eggs by covering them in cold water, bringing it to the
boil, simmering gently for 9 minutes and cooling them under cold
running water. Next mix the sausage meat with the spring onions and
herbs and season well. Then shell the cooled eggs and coat each one
with some of the seasoned flour.  Divide the sausage meat into four
portions and pat each piece out on a floured surface to a shape
roughly 5x3 inches. Now place an egg in the center of each piece and
carefully gather up the sausage meat to cover the egg completely.
Seal one by one, first in beaten egg and then throughly and evenly in
the breadcrumbs. Now heat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a deep frying pan up
to a temperature of 350-375 F. Put the eggs into the oil and fry for
6-8 minutes, turning frequently until they have turned a nice broun
colour. Drain on crumpled greaseproof paper. When they're absolutely
cold, wrap in cling wrap and store.
