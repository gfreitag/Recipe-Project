Title: SAUCE FOR BARBEQUE CHICKEN
Categories: Barbecue, Sauces
Yield: 8 Servings

2 tb Worcestershire
1/4 ts Dry mustard
1 tb Vinegar
1/2 ts Salt
Although here in Eastern N.C. tomato based barbeque sauce is next to
heresy, I have used this recipe for barbeque chicken for many years.
It only takes 5 minutes to cook. Combine ingredients in saucepan.
Cook and stir occasionally over low heat for 5 minutes.
Place chicken pieces in large pan and bake in 350 degree oven for 30
minutes without sauce. Then pour sauce over chicken & cook an
additional 30 minutes, basting OFTEN. Note:watch and check every five
minutes to keep it from burning during the last 15 mins. Hope you can
use this. Judy/NC FROM: JUDY GARNETT (PJXG05A)
