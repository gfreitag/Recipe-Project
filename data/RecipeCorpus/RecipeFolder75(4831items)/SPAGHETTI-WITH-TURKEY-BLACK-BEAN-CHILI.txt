Categories: Pasta, Low-fat, Poultry
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Spaghetti or Linguine
- uncooked
2 tb Vegetable oil; divided
12 oz Ground turkey
1 sm Onion
- peeled and finely diced
1    Jalapeno

Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Crumble the
turkey into the skillet. Cook, stirring to break up the turkey, until
the liquid is evaporated from the skillet and the turkey begins to
brown, about 5 minutes. Add the onion, jalapeno, chili powder, cumin
and garlic and cook until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add
the beans, tomatoes, cilantro and water. Heat to boiling, reduce the
heat and simmer, covered, 15 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.
(The chili can be made up to one day in advance.)

Prepare pasta according to package directions. Drain the pasta and
return it to the pot. Add the chili and stir over medium heat until
the sauce is simmering and the pasta is coated with sauce. Divide
among bowls and serve immediately.
