Categories: Digest, July
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM----------------RON PICKARSKI'S _FRIENDLY_FO---------------------
1 3/8 oz (1 package) dried, sliced
Shiitake mushrooms (or 1 to
1 1/2 c  Reg.)
2 c  Water*
3 tb Tamari*
2 c  Flaked <angle-cut> seitan
1 c  Diced onions
1/2 c  Diced red bell peppers
2 tb Sesame oil (To saute. Use
Apropriate replacement)
2 tb Minced garlic
2 tb Chopped basil
1/2 c  Diced green bell peppers
1/4 c  Sherry
2 c  Water
3 tb Barley miso or other dark
Miso
2 tb Tomato paste <optional>
(tomato is never just
'optional' MC)
1 tb Tamari <optional>
1/4 c  Arrowroot, disolved in 1/4
c  Water.
If you are using the shiite mushrooms, place them in a bowl and cover
them with hot water. Soak until soft (about 30 minutes). Then place
the soaked mushrooms in a pot with 2 cups of water (use the soaking
liquid) and 3 tablespoons tamari. Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes,
and set aside.

Saute' the seitan, mushrooms, onions, and red bell peppers in the oil
(I guess that would be water here...MC) along with the garlic and
basil. When the vegetables are tender (half cooked), add the green
bell peppers, sherry, and 1.75 cups water.

Mix the miso and 1/4 cup water, along with the tomato paste and the
tablespoon of tamari, if you wish. Add to the saute'ed vegetables.
Add the dissolved arrowroot and continue to simmer, while sirring
constantly, until the sauce has thickened. Serve the seitan pepper
steak with noodles, rice, or mashed potatoes.
