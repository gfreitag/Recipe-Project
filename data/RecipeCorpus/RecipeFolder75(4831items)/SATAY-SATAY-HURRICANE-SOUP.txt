1 ts Dried red chili pepper
1 ts Sweet paprika
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
2    Slices fresh galanga

In a blender or food processor, combine garlic, shallot, onion, chili,
paprika and oil.  Process until smoothly combined and pureed. Place
in a small saucepan over low heat and cook for 15 to 20 minutes to
release the flavours, stirring occasionally so it does not burn. Set
the mixture aside and let it cool to room temperature. In a large
saucepan, combine 4 tablespoons of the garlic-onion mixture with
galanga, lemon grass, lime leaves, chicken stock, fish sauce and
sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the shrimp, crab claw,
mussels and fish to the stock. Let the soup return to a boil again
and simmer for a minute or two. Add lime juice, and garnish with
chopped green onion and coriander root.
