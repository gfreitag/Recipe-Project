Title: SHRIMP PASTE SAMBAL (SAMBAL TERASI)
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
Stephen Ceideburg
2 tb Ground chilli
1 sm Onion
1 ts Shrimp Paste, lightly
-grilled
Salt, to taste
1/2    Lemon, juice only
Pound finely the chilli, onion and shrimp paste with salt to taste.
Add lemon juice and blend well. Place in a bowl. This sambal is well
known throughout the archipelago. However I recommend it only for
addicts. If you want to make Indonesian newcomers feel at home, serve
it with vegetables, plain boiled rice and with a grill. Anchovy
fillets, about 2 pieces, may be substituted for shrimp paste if you
wish.
