Title: SALLY LUNN BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Servings
2 c  Milk
2 tb Butter
2 tb Sugar
2 ts Salt
1 pk Dry quick-rising yeast
3    Eggs
4 c  Flour
Makes 2 loaves

Scald the milk, or bring it almost to a simmer, and add the butter,
sugar, and salt.  Let cool until tepid or just warm. Dissolve the
yeast in 1/4 cup of tepid water. Using your electric mixer, if you
have a powerful one, beat the eggs and then add teh milk mixture, the
yeast water, and finally the flour. Beat until very smooth, about 5
minutes.

Leave the dough in the mixing bowl and allow it to rise for one half
hour. Beat it down with the mixer just for a moment and then allow it
to rise again.  Do this a total of 3 times and then put the dough in
2 large greased bread pans.  Allow to rise to double in bulk and then
bake in a preheated 375 F oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour.; The bread
should be light and have a nice crust.
