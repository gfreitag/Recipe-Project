Title: SETTLER'S PICKLE FOR HAMS~ CHEEKS~ & SHOULD
Categories: Information
Yield: 1 Servings  ================== Information file ==================

Fourteen pounds of good salt, half a pound of salpetre, two quarts of
molasses or four pounds of coarse brown sugar, with water enough to
dissolve the salt, and a pint of good beer or of vinegar, if you
command either.  Bring this liquor to a boil, and scum off all the
impurities that may rise to the surface. When cold, pour this over
your hams,which should be cold, but not frozen. The addition of
pepper, allspice, and cloves is made by some who like a high flavour
to the hams. The hams should remain in this pickle six or eight
weeks; being turned and basted every two or three days, and then hung
in the smoke house. The best woods for smoking are: sugar maple
chips, hickory, birch, corn cobs, white ash, and beech. Wehn removed
from the smoke house, sew each ham in any old linen or cotton cloth,
and if you give this covering a coating of whitewash, with a
whitewash brush, it well preserve it from the flies.
