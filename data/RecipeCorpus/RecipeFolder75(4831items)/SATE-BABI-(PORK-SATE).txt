An important difference between this and other kinds of sates is that
we do not usually eat pork with peanut sauce. We eat it by itself, or
with Sambal Kecap.

Cut the pork into small thin squares and marinate for 2 hours. Push
on to bamboo or metal skewers.  Put these on a rack or in a roasting
tin and cook in a preheated oven at 350F (gas mark 4) for 30 minutes,
turning them over several times.

Mix the fat (or butter) with the crushed garlic, soya sauce and lemon
juice. just before serving, brush the sate with this soya and lemon
mixture, and grill for 2 to 3 minutes. Serve immediately.

Most readers will know that the 'five spices' used in this recipe are
a Chinese ingredient, the mixture being composed of star anise,
fennel, cloves, cinnamon and pepper.

Makes 4 servings.
