Title: SMOKED SALMON & DILL WAFFLES
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 8 Servings
4 tb Unsalted butter
1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Double-acting baking powder
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2 c  Milk
2 lg Eggs
5 oz Nova Scotia-style smoked
-salmon
1 md Onion, peeled & finely diced
1/4 c  Snipped fresh dill
Softened cream cheese and finely chopped scallions or sour cream and
salmon caviar for topping.

Preheat your waffle iron. If you want to hold the finished waffles
until serving time, preheat your oven to 200'F.

Melt the butter; reserve. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour,
baking powder, salt and pepper. In another bowl, whisk together the
milk and eggs until well blended. Pour the liquid ingredients over
the dry ingredients and whisk gently to combine. Fold in the salmon,
onion, dill and melted butter.

Lightly butter or spray the grids of your iron, if needed. Brush or
spray the grids again only if subsequent waffles stick.

Spoon out 1/2 cup of batter (or the amount recommended by your waffle
maker's manufacturer) onto the hot iron. Spread the batter evenly
over the grids with a metal spatula or wodden spoon, stopping right
before the edge. Close the lid and bake until golden and crisp. Serve
immediately or keep the waffles, in a single layer, on a rack in the
preheated oven while you make the rest of the batch.

To serve: Add a scoop of cream cheese and a sprinkling of chopped
scallions or a generous spoonful of sour cream and some salmon caviar.
