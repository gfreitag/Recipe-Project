Title: SHOYU CHICKEN
Categories: Chicken, Hawaiian
Yield: 4 Servings
5 lb Chicken pieces
1 c  Low-sodium soy sauce
6 tb Brown sugar
1    Whole dried star anise
2 ts Fresh ginger root, crushed
1 tb Dry sherry
Chinese parsley (cilantro)
Green onions, chopped
(scallions) *
*  Both ingredients are optional.

In a large pan, place chicken with soy sauce, brown sugar, star anise,
ginger, sherry, and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer
over a low flame, stirring occasionally to make sure that the chicken
pieces are all evenly exposed to the seasoning sauce.

If you use the Chinese parsley, cook a few stalks with the chicken.
Otherwise, use the green onions (scallions) fresh as a garnish.

If you want, you can thicken the sauce with cornstarch by removing a
tablespoon of the cooking liquid to a small bowl and stirring in
about 1 teaspoon cornstarch, mixing well to dissolve. Add the mixture
to the cooking liquid after the chicken has been removed and stir
over medium heat until the sauce thickens. Pour over the chicken
before serving.

Makes 4 to 6 servings.
