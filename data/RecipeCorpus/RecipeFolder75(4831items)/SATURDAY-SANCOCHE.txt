Title: SATURDAY SANCOCHE
Categories: Beef, Pulses and
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Salt Beef
2 lb Mixed Produce -- * see note
1/2 lb Pumpkin
12    Ochroes
6    Green Bananas
2 lg Potatoes
1/2 lb Red Beans -- or split peas
1 sm Onion -- per person
2    Carrots
-Seasonings-----
Garlic
Scotch Bonnet

* yam, tannia, cassava, dasheen etc.

1. Put the salt beef to soak overnight. 2. Cut into small pieces and
cover with water (2 pints). 3. Bring to the boil and simmer gently
for 1
1/2    hours with beans or peas. 4. Add peeled and cut up
produce. 5. Add the onions (quartered), pumpkin (cut up), chopped
seasonings and ochroes. 6. Cook until vegetables are tender.

Tip #1:  You can add any type of meat to "beef" up this basically
meatless dish e.g. chicken, beef, pork etc. The only requirement is
that the pieces remain large otherwise they will disappear in the
soup. Tip #2: You can make some flour dumplings and plunk them in the
soup about 1/2 hour before you are ready. Tip #3: This soup gets very
thick very fast! A little water and butter will thin it out.
