Title: SAGO & VERMICELLI KHEER (PUDDING)
Categories: Desserts, Indian
Yield: 1 Servings
4 tb Unsalted Butter
1 c  Vermicelli -- * see note
1 c  Sago
6 1/4 c  Hot Milk
1/4 ts Cardamom Seeds -- crushed
Finely
2 tb Golden Raisins
1 c  Sugar -- (or to taste)
* the best are the ones you get in oriental shops) broken into 2 inch
pieces.

Cook sago in water first until they loose the white color and look
transparent. Set aside. Melt butter in a heavy saucepan. Fry
vermicelli until pieces turn golden brown. This happens rapidly so
watch out. Pour in the hot milk and bring to a simmer. Adjust heat to
keep milk simmering vigorously without letting it boil over. Add
cooked sago (with or without the water), raisins, cardamom.

Let cook for about 20 minutes with frequent stirring. Add sugar and
cook another 5 minutes. Serve hot or chilled in refrigerator. One can
replace the vermicelli with sago but this kind of has a bland taste.
