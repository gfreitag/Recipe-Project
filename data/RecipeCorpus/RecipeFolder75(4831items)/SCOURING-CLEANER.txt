Title: SCOURING CLEANER
Categories: Household, Better
Yield: 14 Oz
MMMMM---------------------CHEAPER AND BETTER--------------------------
1/2 c  Soap flakes OR SOFT SOAP
2 ts Borax
1 1/2 c  Hot water
2 ts Whiting, up to 5t
-(ground chalk, sold at
-hardware stores)
** A custom designed cleanser to take care of your most delicate
Fiberglass fixtures in the bathroom or spa. Rather than clean with
the kind of harsh, sandy abrasives found in powdery cleansers, this
softer version depends on chalk dust for its abrasive action, and you
can control the amount of abrasion by reducing the amount of whiting
you use. Start with 2t whiting. If appliances are old, white, scarred
and pitted use full amount 5t.

In lg plastic bowl, mix soap flakes and borax into water until
dissolved. Add whiting, checking the consistency and degree of
abrasiveness after each teaspoon. Pour into a squeeze top plastic
container, label, and keep out of the reach of children.

To Use: Squeeze some of the cleanser onto a sponge and then wipe down
your appliance. Rinse, dry. For heavily soiled areas, squeeze
directly onto the spot or stain and let it remain 30 mins. Scrub off,
rinse, and repeat if necessary. 14 oz. Typed by Sherilyn Schamber
