Allow the mixture to boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer the
peppers until very tender, about 30 to 35 minutes, adding more
liquid, a little at a time, if it evaporates.

4) Off the heat, stir in the vinegar and sugar and allow the mixture
to cool.

5) This can be served warm, at room temperature, or cold.

Serves 4 [as a side dish]

[Variation: Use roasted red peppers instead of fresh. You'll probably
find this requires less cooking time, and requires more sugar to take
the edge off the roasted red peppers and prevent them from dominating
the dish. - Curtis]
