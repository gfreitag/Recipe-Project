2/3 c  Sugar
2/3 c  Flaked coconut

2 tb All purpose flour
2 ts Vanilla

Preheat oven to 350 deg. Line baking sheet with foil. Line work
surface with waxed paper. Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over
low heat. Remove from heat. Add remaining ingredients except
chocolate and stir well. Drop batter by rounded teaspoonfuls onto
prepared sheet, spacing 4 inches apart (about 5 cookies per sheet).
Keep remaining batter warm over very low heat. Bake cookies 10
minutes. Slip foil off sheet. Let cookies cool until firm, about 10
minutes. Using thin spatula, transfer cookies to waxed paper. Repeat
with remaining cookie batter, stirring well before using.

Melt chocolates in double boiler over gently simmering water; stir
until smooth. Take 2 cookies of similar size. Spread bottom of 1
cookie with 1 teaspoon melted chocolate. Top chocolate with second
cookie, pressing gently to form "sandwich."  Repeat with remaining
cookies. Let cool. (Can be prepared 1 month ahead and frozen. Store
between layers of waxed paper. Bring to room temperature before
serving.)
