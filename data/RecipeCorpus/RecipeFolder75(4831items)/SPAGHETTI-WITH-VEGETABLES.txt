Title: SPAGHETTI WITH VEGETABLES
Categories: Digest, Oct.
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Box spaghetti
1 lg Bell pepper
1 lg Onion
4 sm Zucchinis
8 oz Fresh mushrooms
1    Jar Healthy Choice pasta
Sauce
x  Ff soy parmesan
Saute big chunks from a bell pepper, a large onion and 3-4 small
zuccinis along with 8 oz slices fresh mushrooms (Is 1/4 tsp
extra-vigin olive oil illegal on this board?). Add a jar (sometimes
two if I overdid the veggies) of Healthy Choice traditional spaghetti
sauce. Serve over thin spaghetti and top with FF paramesan. If you
feel deprived as you eat this then somethings wrong!
