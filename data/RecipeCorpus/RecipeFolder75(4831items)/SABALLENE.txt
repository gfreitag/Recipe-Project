Cut  bottom of orange just enough to let it stand on it's own. Remove
top of orange.  Hollow out orange leaving just a shell of peel. Mix
egg yolks and sugar, heat over double boiler, making sure heat never
gets to simmering.   Add  Marsala  and Grand Marnier. Return to heat
and whip, watching temperature. When consistency is stiffer,add
chilled water.

Whip some more. When firm, pour into orange shell, serve hot or cold.
