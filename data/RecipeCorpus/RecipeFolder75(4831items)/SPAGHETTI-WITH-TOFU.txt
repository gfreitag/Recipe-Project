Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
2 1/2 c  Tofu; crumbled
8 c  ;water; boiling
2 tb Olive oil
1 lg Onion; chopped
5    Garlic cloves; minced
1 ts Thyme
1 ts Basil
1/2 ts Oregano
1/4 ts Celery seed
1/8 ts Cloves, ground
2 c  Mushrooms; sliced
4 tb Tamari
8 oz Whole wheat spaghetti
1/4 c  Parsley; minced
1/2 c  Dry red wine
Drop the tofu into a large kettle of boiling water.
Bring the water back to a boil and cook for 1 minute.

Line a colander with a clean dishtowel and drain the tofu in the
colander. Rinse the tofu under cold water to cool it off for easier
handling. Bring the edges of the towel together, twist the towel, and
press the excess water out of the tofu. Continue pressing the tofu
until it has a firm ground-beef-like texture, then set it aside.

Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the onion, garlic, thyme, basil,
oregano, celery seed and cloves.
Saute over low heat until the onion is almost tender.
Add the mushrooms and cook until they are done.

Add the pressed tofu to the sauteed mixture. Stir in the tamari and
mix well. Set the skillet aside while you prepare the spaghetti.

Boil a large kettle of water and cook the spaghetti until it is
tender. Drain the cooked spaghetti and add it to the skillet with the
tofu mixture. Add the wine and the parsley; mix well.

Serve with a big green salad.
