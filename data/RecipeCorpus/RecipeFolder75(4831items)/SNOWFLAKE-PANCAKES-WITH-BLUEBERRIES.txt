Title: SNOWFLAKE PANCAKES WITH BLUEBERRIES
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 1 Servings
1    Cake yeast or
1/4 oz Package dry yeast
1/4 c  Water
1 qt Buttermilk
1 tb Baking soda
4 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
4 c  Flour
2 tb Baking powder
1/4 c  Cooking oil
6    Eggs -- well beaten
1 c  Blueberries
Preparation of these pancakes must begin the night before they are to
be served. Soften yeast in warm water. (if using a yeast cake, water
should be 80. Dry yeast has better results if the water is heated
from 105 to 115.) In a separate container mix together buttermilk,
baking soda, sugar and salt. Add to this the softened yeast. Sift
flour and baking powder together and add, with the oil, to the
buttermilk mixture. Mix well. Fold in the eggs. Place in refrigerator
overnight in a container large enough to allow the batter to double
in bulk.  In the morning add the blueberries to the dough and stir
down. Cook in a fry pan over medium heat and serve. This recipe will
keep in a refrigerator for a week or more. If black specks appear in
the batter, just stir them in. They are just the yeast mold and do no
harm.
