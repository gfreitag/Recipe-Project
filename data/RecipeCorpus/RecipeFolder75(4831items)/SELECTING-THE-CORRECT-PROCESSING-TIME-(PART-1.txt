Title: SELECTING THE CORRECT PROCESSING TIME (PART 1
Categories: Canning, Information
Yield: 1 Guide  When canning in boiling water, more processing time is needed for most
raw-packed foods and for quart jars than is needed for hot-packed
foods and pint jars.

To destroy microorganisms in acid foods processed in a boiling-water
canner, you must:

* Process jars for the correct number of minutes in boiling water. *
Cool the jars at room temperature.

The food may spoil if you fail to add process time for lower
boiling-water temperatures at altitudes above 1,000 feet, process for
fewer minutes than specified, or cool jars in cold water.

To destroy microorganisms in low-acid foods processed with a pressure
canner, you must:

* Process the jars using the correct time and pressure specified for
your altitude.

* Allow canner to cool at room temperature until it is completely
depressurized.

The food may spoil if you fail to select the proper process times for
specific altitudes, fail to exhaust canners properly, process at lower
pressure than specified, process for fewer minutes than specified, or
cool the canner with water.
