reduced by half, about 8 minutes.  Add the parsley, salt, pepper,
coriander and Tabasco; keep warm.

COUSCOUS AND FISH:  In a nonreactive medium saucepan, combine the
stock, citrus zests, chili paste and 1 T of the oil and bring to a
boil over high heat.  Stir in the couscous, cover and let stand off
the heat until liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.  Season with
salt and pepper and fluff with fork.

Light grill or preheat broiler.  Rub the sea bass with the remaining
1 t oil and season on both sides with salt and pepper. Grill or broil
for about 2 minutes, or until lightly golden and sizzling. Gently
turn the fish, drizzle on the lemon juice and broil for about 3
minutes longer, or until just cooked through.

Divide the couscous among 6 plates.  Arrange the sea bass on the
couscous, spoon the orange sauce over and garnish with extra parsley
sprigs.
