SAUTEED GARLIC, RED PEPPERS, CHICORIES, CHARD, AND SPINACH FOR WHITE
CHEDDAR POLENTA From Potager: Fresh Garden Cooking in the French
Style by Georgeanne Brennan Pour the water into a saucepan, salt it,
and bring it to a boil over high heat.  Add the polenta in a very
slow, steady stream, stirring as you pour. Reduce the heat and cook
for 40 to 45 minutes, stirring frequently. The polenta is done when
it pulls away slightly from the sides of the pan.
While the polenta is cooking, wash the greens carefully to remove
any bits of sand or grit.  With a sharp knife, cut the leaves
lengthwise into 2 or 3 strips.  Dry the greens thoroughly in a salad
spinner or gather them up in a clean cloth and roll them dry.
Cut the peppers in half lengthwise and remove the seeds and ribs.
Cut the halves lengthwise into thin slices.
Just before the polenta is ready, heat the olive oil in a large
skillet and add the garlic and sweet peppers. Saute for 2 or 3
minutes and then add the greens. Sprinkle with the salt, reduce the
heat, cover the pan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. The greens will
steam and reduce considerably in volume. Remove the cover and
continue cooking until the greens are limp but still retain their
color, a few minutes.
When the polenta is done, stir in the butter, cheese, salt, and
pepper. Remove the pan from the heat and spread the polenta onto a
warmed serving platter.  Top it with the mixture of sauteed greens
and peppers and serve at once.  Serves 4.
