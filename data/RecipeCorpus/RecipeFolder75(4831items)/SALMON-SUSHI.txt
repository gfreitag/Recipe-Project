Title: SALMON SUSHI
Categories: Japanese, Seafood
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/4    Parts vinegar
2    Parts salt
Filet out the he middle portion from back to front. Marinate for one
day in a mixture of salt and 5% vinegar until the surface of the fish
is "cooked" (like seviche). Freeze overnight and then slice thin and
serve. I didn't get the proportions of salt and vinegar but I am
assuming that it is very similar to what I use for pickling fish.
