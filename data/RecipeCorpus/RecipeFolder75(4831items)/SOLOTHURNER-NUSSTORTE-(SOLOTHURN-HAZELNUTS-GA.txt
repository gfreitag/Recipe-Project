Allow to cool. When cold, spread a thin layer of butter cream on one
circle, cover with the sponge (recipe below) and then spread a layer
of butter cream over the sponge. Place the second circle on top, mask
the sides with butter cream and coat these with the coarsely ground
hazelnuts (roasted). Dust the finished gateau with icing sugar.
SPONGE: Cream the butter and sugar. Add the egg yolks one at a time
and continue beating. Mix the flour, cornflour and hazelnuts
together. Fold the dry ingredients and the stiffly beaten egg whites
into the creamed mixture alternately. Pour into a greased sponge tin
(22 cm diameter) and bake for 20 minutes at 160-170 oC.
