Title: SICILIAN PIZZA DOUGH
Categories: Breadmaker, Pizza
Yield: 1 Servings
1 pk Dry yeast
3 c  All purpose flour
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Kosher salt
2 tb Non-fat dry milk powder
1 tb Butter; at room temperature
1 1/4 c  Warm water
Place all ingredients into breadmaker in the order listed. Allow
breadmaker to knead and let rise slightly before removing,
approximately 20 to 25 minutes.  Don't forget to remove the dough
before the bake cycle starts. NOTE: I use the DAK Autobakery on the
white bread setting to make this dough.  I then remove the dough and
place it on a lightly floured cutting board and cover with a clean
moist towel to rise an additional 30 minutes or so before forming to
the pizza tray.
