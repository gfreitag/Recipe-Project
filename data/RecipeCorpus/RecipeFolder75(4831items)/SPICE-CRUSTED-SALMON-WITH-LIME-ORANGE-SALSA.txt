Salsa:

With a sharp knife, remove skin and white pith from oranges and
discard. Working over a medium-sized bowl to catch the juice, cut the
orange segments from their surrounding membrane, letting the segments
fall into the bowl.  Add onions, lime juice, cilantro, chipotle
peppers and garlic. Stir to combine.  Season with salt and pepper.
(Salsa can be made ahead and stored, covered, in the refrigerator for
up to 8 hours.)

Salmon:

Heat a small skillet over medium heat.  Add coriander and cumin;
toast, stirring constantly, until aromatic, 2 to 3 minutes. Let cool
and transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle. Add peppercorns to
the mill and coarsely grind all the spices.  Stir in salt. Prepare
grill. Coat salmon with the spice mixture.  Grill on a lightly oiled
rack until the fish is opaque in the center, about 5 minutes per
side. Serve with salsa.
