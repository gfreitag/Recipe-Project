PREPARE THE FILLING: Melt butter in large heavy saucepan. Add Cabbage
and Bok Choy greens, currants, onion and scallions. Cook over
medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes or until greens begin to wilt. Add
dill, cilantro and Sea Salt, and cook for 1 minute over high heat,
stirring well to thoroughly incorporate herbs into vegetables. Set
aside. PREPARE THE MUSHROOMS: In a separate large skillet, melt
butter. Add mushrooms and saute briefly over high heat stiring
frequently until they begin to soften. Remove from heat, sprinkle
with lemon juice and add to vegetable mixture. Mix well. ASSEMBLE THE
STRUDEL: Preheat oven to 400 F. Strain mushroom-vegetable mixture in
colander, catching the liquid in a small bowl. (Reserve to add to
soups, gravies etc.) Lightly butter cookie sheet. Place one phyllo
sheet on damp towel, brush lightly with melted butter. Place second
phyllo sheet on top of first. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs
on left-hand side of phyllo. Fold right side over to encase bread
crumbs, making a rectangle. Brush top lightly with melted butter.
Spread 1/2 the vegetable mixture along the long edge, stopping 1"
short of the sides. Roll as you would a jelly roll. Place seam side
down on buttered baking sheet. Brush roll with melted butter. Repeat
for second roll. Bake until golden; about 30 minutes. Cut each into
3-4 sections
