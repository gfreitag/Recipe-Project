2 tb Onion; chopped

4 c  Beef broth;with rich flavor

1/4 c  Leek; white part only/sliced
1/2 c  Cabbage; shredded

*Chayote is also called Mirlaton or Huisquil, and is a type of
squash.
Make the meatballs: Mix all ingredients and shape into 3/4"
meatballs. Bring the broth to a low simmer and add the vegatables.
Add the meatballs and top them with the paste. Cover and simmer over
low heat for 30 minutes. Serve hot in bowls, with tortillas.  Note: I
like to make my own beef broth for all recipes, but particularly for
this one, as it needs a rather strong broth.  This recipe is from the
book False Tongues and Sunday Bread, by Copeland Marks. Barb Day
