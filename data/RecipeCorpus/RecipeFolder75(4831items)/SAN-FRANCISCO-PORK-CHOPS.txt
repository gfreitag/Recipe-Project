Categories: Lisa, Pork, Rice/pasta, Spicy, Yummy
Yield: 8 Servings
8    Thin boneless pork chops
2 tb Oil
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1 lb Angel hair pasta
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
4 ts Oil
1/2 c  Sherry
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1/4 c  Brown sugar
1/2 ts Crushed red pepper
4 ts Cornstarch
1/4 c  Water
Trim pork chops of fat. Heat oil in skillet. Brown chops on both
sides.

Remove chops, and add a little more oil if needed. Saute garlic for a
minute, being careful not to burn it.

Combine oil, sherry, soy sauce, brown sugar and red pepper. Return
chops to skillet. Pour sauce over them. Simmer over low heat until
chops are tender and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Add a little
water, 2 to 3 tb, if needed to keep sauce from cooking down too much.
Turn once.

Meanwhile, cook the angel hair pasta according to package directions.
Remove to a serving dish and keep warm.

Arrange chops over pasta. Add cornstarch dissolved in water to
remaining sauce in skillet. Cook until thickened. Pour over chops and
serve.

Menu Idea: Brown & Serve Rolls, wine, Spicy Applesauce Bread and
mulled apple cider for dessert.
