and ginger mixture.  Stir-fry 30 seconds. Add Szechuan mustard green;
stir- fry 2 minutes.

Soup:  In 2-quart saucepan, boil the water.  Add hot pork stir-fry;
simmer 3 minutes.  Five minutes before serving, bring broth to boil,
and add soaked noodles and minced coriander. Simmer 3 minutes or
until noodles are soft, but not pasty.  Pour into serving bowl,
garnish with coriander sprigs and sesame oil, and serve.
