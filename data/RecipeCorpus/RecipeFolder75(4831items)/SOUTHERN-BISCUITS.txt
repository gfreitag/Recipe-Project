Title: SOUTHERN BISCUITS
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 8 Servings
2 1/2 c  Sifted, self-rising flour
1/2 c  Lard or shortening
1 c  Buttermilk
From "A Treasury or Southern Baking" by Prudence Hilburn.
HarperCollins; 1993.

Preheat the oven to 475'F. Lightly grease a baking sheet.

Put the flour in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center. Add
the shortening (lard) and buttermilk. Start working the flour into
the milk and shortening, squeezing the mixture through the fingers
until a soft dough is formed. This will be a sticky dough. Lift the
dough from the bowl and start folding, gently kneading or pressing
with the fingertips, and turning the dough until it is no longer
sticky. Pat the dough to a thickness of about 1/2". Cut with a 2"
biscuit cutter. (Or instead, many Southern bakers prefer to pinch off
small portions of dough to make balls about 1 1/2" in diameter. Roll
balls in your palms, place on baking sheet, and press with knuckles
to flatten slightly.) Place on baking sheet. If you want outside to
be crispy, the biscuits should be placed about 1" apart. For a soft
biscuit, place with edges touching. Bake for about 8 minutes, until
lightly browned. Best served hot from the oven, with butter, if
desired.
