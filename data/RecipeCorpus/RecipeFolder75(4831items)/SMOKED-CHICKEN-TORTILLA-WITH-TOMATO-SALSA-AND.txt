Categories: Poultry, Salads
8    chicken thighs -- smoked,
sliced
Yield: 4 Servings
:
8    flour tortillas -- grilled
1 c  Tomato Salsa
1 c  Avocado Relish

Prepare a charcoal or wood fire in a domed grill and let it burn down
to embers. Lay chips of soaked aromatic wood over the ashes-you just
want to get the smoke going, not a very hot fire. (Food won't be
cooked, but it will be infused with a smoky flavor.) Arrange the
thighs on the grill rack. Open the top vent slightly and cover the
grill so that the smoke stays inside.

Place thighs on the grill and cook for 3 minutes per side Slice and
serve on individual plate or bowls with grilled tortillas, tomato
salsa and avocado relish.

Yield: 4 servings
