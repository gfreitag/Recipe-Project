Title: SEVEN STEP JERKY
Categories: Meats, Dehydrator
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Venison
1/2 c  Soy sauce
1/2 c  Worcestershire sauce
2 ts MSG
2 ts Seasoned salt
2/3 ts Garlic powder
2 ts Onion powder
2/3 ts Pepper
Slice three pounds of venison into strips about 1/8 inch thick to
ensure total saturation of the meat while it's marinating. Partial
freezing beforehand aids in slicing thin. Combine all ingredients in
a bowl. Stir this mixture well with a spoon to dissolve all of the
soluble ingredients. Now the marinaade is ready to be used. Place the
strips of meat in the marinade, be sure they're completely submerged.
Marinate overnight, turning if necessary.  Lay marinated meat strips
on oven rack. Cook for 6 to 8 (6 is better) at 150 degrees. They get
crisper the longer they bake. Store finished jerky in zip-lock bags
or other airtight containers to seal in freshness.  Jerky will keep
up to two years. A good book on making beef jerky and other
light-weight foods is:
