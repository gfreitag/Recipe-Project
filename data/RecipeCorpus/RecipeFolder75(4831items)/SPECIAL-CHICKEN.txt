1 1/2 lb Chicken wings, cut-up into

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
MMMMM-------------------------A MIXTURE------------------------------
2 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Sugar

A few gratings of fresh
-ginger
2 ts Hoisin sauce
1    Clove garlic, minced
1/4 ts Sesame oil
1 ts Salt
ds MSG (optional)
MMMMM-------------------------B MIXTURE------------------------------
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Cornstarch
1/2 c  Flour
Oil for deep frying
Lettuce leaves, shredded
Green onion, Chinese parsley and cashew nuts, all chopped, for
garnish This is one of the better deep-fried chicken recipes I've
found. It calls for chicken wings, but I used a whole chicken, cut up
Chinese style and just increased the marinade ingredients a tad.

Serve this with side dishes of hoisin sauce, spiced salt (toasted salt
mixed with black pepper about half and half), hot mustard and chili
oil along with a bowl of finely chopped scallions. Dip piece of
chicken into the dip of your choice, then into the scallions and
enjoy! Ice cold beer goes great with this dish. Oh yeah++steamed rice
too...

Be sure to use the dark, toasted sesame oil rather than the health
food store stuff.

1.  Soak cut-up chicken in marinade ingredients A for 1 hour. Mix
ingredients B into bowl with marinated chicken. Stir well. Will be
very sticky and stiff to mix.

2.  Heat 2 inches oil in wok to 375F.  Drop batter covered chicken
piece by piece carefully into hot oil. Do not fill wok too full of
chicken or it will take too long to brown. Should take only 5 minutes
to cook through. Result will be crispy golden brown chicken pieces.

3.  Drain on paper towels.  Place on platter lined with lettuce
shreds.

4.  Garnish if desired with chopped green onions, Chinese parsley and
cashew nuts.
