Title: SOFT CREAM
Categories: Sauces, Desserts

1/3 c  Icing Sugar
1 tb Vanilla Extract
2 tb Brandy

1/4 c  Sour Cream
Servings: 15

Chill beaters and a medium bowl until very cold. Place all
ingredients in bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed
until soft, loose peaks form, 3 - 4 minutes. The cream should have a
slightly runny, cloud-like consistency that softly drapes over the
bread pudding. Do not overbeat. Cover tightly and refrigerate until
served.
