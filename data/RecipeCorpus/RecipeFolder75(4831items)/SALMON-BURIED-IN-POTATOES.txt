Title: SALMON BURIED IN POTATOES
Categories: Fish, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
4    7-oz skinless salmon fillets
2 lb Russet potatoes
1 tb Lemon juice
6 lg Scallions
- thinly sliced into rounds
Kosher salt
White pepper
12 tb Butter
1/2 c  Shallots
1/2 c  Dry white wine
1/2 c  White wine vinegar
PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. Heavily butter 4 pieces of 9-by-12-inch aluminum
foil, then sprinkle with salt and white pepper. Shred the potatoes
and mix with lemon juice and scallions. Make a bed using half the
potatoes on each piece of aluminum foil. Place a salmon fillet on the
potato bed, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with remaining
potatoes. Press down on the potatoes, then enclose tightly in foil.
Place in oven for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine shallots, wine and
vinegar in a saucepan. Place over medium heat and cook until most of
the liquid is evaporated. Remove from the heat and beat in remaining
butter. Add salt and white pepper to taste and set briefly aside in a
warm place. When it's time to put dinner on the table, heat the
broiler. Unwrap the salmon, and place it close to the heat. Brown
well, about 2 minutes per side. Arrange the salmon on a platter and
serve the sauce separately.
