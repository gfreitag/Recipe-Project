Title: SEAFOOD STOCK
Categories: Cajun
Yield: 1 Servings
3 lb Rinsed shrimp heads & shells
4 qt Water
You may also use crawfish heads and/or shells, or rinsed fish
carcasses (heads and gills removed), or some combination.

In a large stockpot, combine the watere and the seafood. Bring to a
boil.
Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer 3 to 4 hours, or until the liquid
is reduced by half.  Remove from the heat and strain through a sieve.
Allow it to cool slightly, then refrigerate or freeze in batches
until needed.

note:  I generally throw in some coarsely chopped onion, bell pepper
and celery to add some additional flavor. But if you just want the
seafood taste, which is needed for some of the delicate sauces, just
use this basic recipe.
