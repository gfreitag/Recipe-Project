Title: SPELLS BERRY CRESCENT DINNER ROLLS
Categories: Breads, Pitzer
Yield: 32 Servings
2 pk Active Dry Yeast
3/4 c  Warm Water (110 to 115
-degrees F.)
1/2 c  Sugar
1 ts Salt
2 lg Eggs
1/2 c  Shortening (Part Butter)
4 c  Unbleached Flour
Butter Or Regular Margarine, Softened

In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Stir in
the sugar, salt, eggs, shortening and half of the flour into the
yeast mixture. Add the remaining flour blending until smooth. Scrape
the dough from the sides of the bowl and cover with a cloth dampened
in warm water. (The cloth should feel wet, but not be so wet that
water drips onto the dough.) Let rise in a warm place (85 degrees
F.), until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Divide the dough in half,
rolling each half into a 12-inch circle 1/4 inch thick.  Spread with
the soft butter and cut each circle into 16 wedges. Roll up each
wedge beginning at the largest end. Place, point side down, on a
greased baking sheet. Curve to form crescents. Cover and let rise
until double, 1 hour.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and bake for
12 to 15 minutes, or until they are a rich golden brown. Brush with
soft butter. Makes
32    crescent rolls.
