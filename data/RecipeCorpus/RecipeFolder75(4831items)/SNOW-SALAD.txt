1 pk Knox unflavored gelatin
1/4 c  Cold water
1 c  Boiling water
2/3 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla
2 c  Sour cream <16 ozs>
8 oz Cool whip--thawed
1 pk Danish dessert mix
~<junket>--raspberry ~flavored
2 1/2 c  Cold water ~frozen box or bag of ~raspberries, thawed,
juice ~reserved.
2 1/2 c  Cold water <part raspberry ~juice>
1/3 c  Sugar
2 tb Tapioca

Salad: Using wire whip, blend cold water with gelatin. Add boiling
water and mix well. Whip in sugar and vanilla and mix well. Whip in
sour cream and cool whip.  Pour into ring mold and refrigerate
overnight.

Several hours before you're ready to serve, make the topping.

Mom's topping: Stir junket into cold liquid in pan--we use part of the
raspberry juice to replace part of the water. Bring to boil, boil 1
minute. Cool completely, but do not refrigerate. Just before serving,
add raspberries, pour over unmolded salad, and serve extra sauce on
the side.

My Last-Minute Panicked Topping: stir sugar and tapioca into water and
bring to boil. Boil 1 minute. Cool completely but do not refrigerate.
Follow serving directions as above.

Lisa's notes: this salad has a raspberry sauce.  My mom's recipes
called for Danish Dessert <junket> raspberry flavored. My hubby and I
went to 10+ grocery stores and there was none to be found. Finally my
mom <who lives 4 hours away> called and read me the ingredient list
and I made up my own sauce based on that. My husband thought my
topping was even better than my mom's, so I'll stop hunting for the
junket mix. People never want to try this <it sounds like a strange
combination> but when we get them to, they really like it!
