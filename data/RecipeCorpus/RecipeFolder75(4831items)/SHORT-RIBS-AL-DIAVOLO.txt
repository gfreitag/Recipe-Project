4 lb Beef short ribs
1/4 c  Butter; melted
2    Cloves garlic; mashed
1 oz Salt pork; diced
12    Fresh parsley sprigs; leaves
-only, finely chopped
1/2 c  All-purpose flour; sifted
2    Eggs, beaten
1/2 c  Bread crumbs; sifted
1 ts Salt; optional
1/3 ts Ground black pepper
1/3 ts Red pepper; crushed
Olive oil
Juice of 1 fresh lemon
3 tb Prepared french mustard
Cut the short ribs into serving pieces and trim off all fat and
skim. Or have butcher do this for you.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Make a mixture of butter, garlic, salt
pork, and parsley; set aside.
Arrange the ribs in a broiler pan.  Cook in the oven for 15 minutes.
Turn the ribs and cook for 15 minutes longer. Lift out ribs and
discard fat.

Dust ribs with the flour, shaking off any excess.
Dip them into beaten eggs, then into bread crumbs.
Sprinkle with salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. Place the
ribs in a roasting pan and spoon olive oil over the ribs, turning
them so they are coated with oil. Then spoon the butter mixture over
the top. Bake for 40 minutes.  Combine lemon juice and mustard and
spoon this mixture over the ribs.
Cover the pan and cook for about 5 minutes more, or until meat is
tender. Arrange ribs on a warm platter and spoon drippings and gravy
over top. Nice with a bottle of Barolo with this.
