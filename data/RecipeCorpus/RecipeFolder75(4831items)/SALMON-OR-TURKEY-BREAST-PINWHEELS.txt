Title: SALMON OR TURKEY BREAST PINWHEELS
Categories: Sun-dried, Poultry, Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
12 lg Flour tortillas
8 oz Pkg cream cheese; soft
1/2 c  Butter or margarine; soft
1/4 ts Fresh lemon juice
1/4 ts Ground white pepper
Sprigs of fresh dill; or
Dill pickles; cut thin
-spears
1 lg Pk moist smoked salmon;
-thinly sliced
Mix together cream cheese, butter, pepper, and lemon juice. (I do
this in the food processor). Spread the tortillas, one at a time,
with this mixture. Lay the smoked salmon slices, slightly
overlapping, over the cream cheese mixture, leaving one edge of the
cream cheese uncovered (this acts as the "glue" to hold the tortilla
together when rolled.) Lay fresh dill sprigs or dill pickle spears
down one edge; starting with this edge, roll up tightly, "gluing"
tortilla together at the end with the uncovered edge of cream cheese.
Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and chill, at least one hour or up to 24
hours.  When ready to serve, unwrap and slice about 1/2" thick on a
slight diagonal. TURKEY BREAST PINWHEELS WITH SUNDRIED TOMATO SPREAD
Same as above, except substitute very thinly sliced turkey breast for
the salmon, omit lemon juice from cream cheese mixture and add 1/4
cup oil packed sundried tomatoes, finely chopped; use watercress in
place of dill. You may have tortillas left over, use the amount of
spread for each which gives a uniform covering with no tortilla
showing through, but also not to thick!! If you like capers, they are
wonderful added to the spread for the Salmon pinwheels. (wrv)
