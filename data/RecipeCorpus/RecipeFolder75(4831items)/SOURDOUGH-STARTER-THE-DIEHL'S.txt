Title: SOURDOUGH STARTER THE DIEHL'S
Categories: Sourdough
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Skim or lowfat milk
3 tb Yogurt;plain or lofat
Warm a 1 1/2 quart glass, ceramic, rigid plastic, or stainless steel
container by filling it with hot water and letting it stand for
several minutes; wipe dry.
Heat 1 cup skim or lo-fat milk to 90-100  on a thermometer. Remove
from heat and stir in 3 tablespooons plain unflavored, lo-fat yogurt.
Pour into warm container, cover tightly, and let stand in a warm
place (80 - 100 ).
After 18 to 24 hours, starter should be about the consistency of
yogurt (a curd forms and mixture does not flow readily when container
is slightly tilted). During this time, if some clear liquid rises to
top of milk, simply stir it back in. However, if liquid has turned
light pink, it idicates that the milk is beginning to break down;
discard and try again.
After a curd has formed, gradually stir 1 cup all purpose flour into
starter until smooth. Cover tightly and let stand in a warm place (80
~ 100 ) until mixture is full of bubbles and has a good sour smell;
this takes 2 to 5 days.
During this time if clear liquid forms, stir it back into starter.
/But if liquid turns pink, spoon out and discard all but 1/4 cup
starter; thin blend in a mixture of 1 cup each warm milk (90 - 100 )
and flour. Cover tightly and let stand in warm place until bubbly and
sour smelling; then it is ready to use.
To store, cover and refrigerate. Makes about 1 1/2 cups starter.
To maintain an ample supply, repelenish your starter every time you
use it. Do this by adding a mixture of 1/2 cup each warm milk (90 -
100 ) and flour. Cover and let stand in a warm place for several
hours or until next day; mixture should be full of bubbles again.
Store covered in refrigerator.
For consistent flavor, continue using the same type of milk you
originally used. Always let your starter come to room temperature
before using it; this takes 4 to 6 hours. If you plan to bake in the
morning, leave it out the night before.
If you bake regularly- about once a week - the starter should keep
lively and active. You can check your starter occasionally to see if
its active by spooning out about 1/4 cup of the starter and mixing it
with 1/2 cup each warm milk (90  - 100 ) and flour. Cover and let
stand in a warm spot. Check often; it should bubble again in 4 to 8
hours. You can combine this mixture with the original starter after
the test.
If  you dont bake often, its best to discard about half your
starter and replenish it with warm milk and flour about every 2
months to keep it active.
The feel of dough containing sourdough starter is slightly tacky
when lightly touched. =============== Reply 82 of Note 1
