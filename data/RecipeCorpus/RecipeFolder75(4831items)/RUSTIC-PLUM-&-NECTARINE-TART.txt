Ice water

PASTRY:  In large bowl, combine flour, sugar and salt; cut in butter
and lard until mixture resembles fine crumbs with a few large pieces.
In measuring cup, beat together egg yolk, lemon juice and enough ice
water to make 1/2 cup; briskly stir enough into flour mixture, 1 tbsp
at a time, to make dough hold together. Shape into disc; wrap and
chill for at least 20 minutes.  Let cold pastry stand for 15 minutes
at room temperature before rolling.  On lightly surgace, roll out
pastry iinto 14 inch circle, leaving edges rough.  Transfer to 12
inch pizza pan,letting pastry hang over edge.

In food processor, process 1/4 cup of the sugar, pecans and flour
until nuts are finely ground; spread over pastry on pan. Arrange
plums and nectarines over nuts; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup of
the sugar. Dot with butter. Fold pastry overhang over fruit, brush
with milk, and sprinkle a little more sugar over. Bake in 425 F oven
for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 F and bake for 35 minutes longer
or until pastry is golden and juices are bubbling, shielding pastry
with foil to prevent over-browning if necessary.  Let cool. Melt
jelly and brush over fruit. Makes 10-12 servings.
