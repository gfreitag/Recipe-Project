Title: SOURDOUGH STUFFED TROUT
Categories: Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
1 sm Loaf sourdough or crusty
Italian bread
2 tb Finely chopped parsley
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1/2 c  Thinly sliced green onions
(including some tops)
1 md Sized green pepper,
Finely chopped
3 tb Dry white wine
1/4 c  Melted butter or margarine
6    Whole cleaned trout (each
About 12 inches long)
Salt and pepper
Preheat oven to 400.  Cut enough bread into 1/2 inch cubes to make 2
cups (reserve remainder for other uses). Spread bread cubes in single
layer on baking sheet and bake, stirring occasionally, until cubes
are dry and crisp (about 10 minutes). Remove from oven and pour into
a bowl; combine with parsley, the 1/2 tsp. salt, pepper, green onion,
and green pepper. Drizzle wine and 2 TBS. of the butter over bread;
mix lightly.

Wipe fish with damp cloth, inside cavities and outside. Brush
cavities with some of the remaining butter; sprinkly lightly with
salt and pepper. Stuff cavities loosely with bread mixture, dividing
mixture evenly among fish; skewer edges together or sew with heavy
thread. Arrange fish side by side in a greased shallow baking pan
(use 2 pans, if necessary, to hold all fish at once).  Drizzle any
remaining butter evenly over tops of fish.

Bake fish, uncovered, until it flakes readily when prodded in
thickest portion with a fork.  For a 1 inch thick fish allow 10
minutes - 5 minutes on a side.
