This recipe is a lot of trouble and is recommended only for genuine
chili fanatics.
Brown meat in lard until gray.  Add onions and cook until clear.
Combine in a food processor or blender the cumin, garlic, chilies
pasillas, chiliie quebrados, t Tabasco, salt, jalapenos, and
tomatoes. Blend and set aside to steep. Remove stems, membranes, and
seeds from dried anchos, red chiles, and jalapenos peppers. Place
these last three peppers in a small saucepan and barely cover with
warm water. Bring to a boil over medium heat and then simmer about 15
minutes. Next place softened peppers in the processor or blender.
Save the water in which you boiled the peppers. You can use this
water to hotten up the chili later.
Now blend the peppers with the  tomato mixture until smooth and add
all this to the cooking meat and onions. Add sugar, beer, and
chocolate to chili.  Turn the fire down real low and simmer without
covering - at least 2 hours. Stir occasionally to keep it from
sticking. Keep quart of water nearby.  Add as needed to keep a soupy
consistency. Thirty minutes before you are ready to serve chili
combine masa with enough water to make a thin paste and, stirring
vigorously, add to the chili. This will bind the chili and thicken it
up. Stir chili frequently during the last half hour so that it
doesn't stick.  You can taste it at this point, and if it isn't hot
enough to suit you, pour in a little of the seasoned water in which
you cooked the chiles. This is liquid fire, so go easy. Pour a little
and taste.  Also adjust the salt during this half hour.
