MMMMM-----------------KLINGON SOUR POTATO SALAD----------------------
2 1/2 lb Potatoes
4    Green onions;chopped
1/4 c  Parsley; chopped
1/8 ts Dried basil
1 tb Margarine
3    Eggs

Scrub the potatoes and put them on to boil in a large saucepan with
enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and
simmer until they are tender, about 30 minutes or so.
While they are cooking, mix the salad dressing and set aside.
When the potatoes are tender, drain them and run cold water over them
until they can just be handled. Drain them and peel them. Dice them
into 1/2" pieces. Add the onions, parsley and salad dressing, along
with a pinch of basil. Mix gently and set aside.
In a frypan, melt the margarine; beat the eggs together wtih a fork
and pour them into the pan. Cook until one side is lightly browned
and the top has begun to set. Slide out onto a plate, flip back into
the pan and cook the second side. Slice the omelet into thin strips
and cut the strips into short lengths. Add the egg pieces to the
salad and mix again, gently.
Serve immediately, or keep warm in the oven (200f or less) until you
are ready to serve. If you wish to serve it cold, chill for several
hours in the refrigerator before serving.
