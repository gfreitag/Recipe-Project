Scenery, unique rock formations, hiking trails, a beach and plenty of
picnic tables attract Mary Ann Mynsberge of Mosinee, Wisconsin, and
her family to the Dells of the Eau Claire Park, 15 miles east of
Wausau, Wisconsin.  Oregano, chives and celery seed season her salad.

1.  Cook vermicelli according to package directions. Drain and rinse
with cold water.  Drain off the water.

2.  In a very large bowl, combine vermicelli, onion, green pepper,
parsley, celery seed, oregano, and chives.  Add Italian dressing.
Toss to coat.

3.  Add mayonnaise, shrimp, or fish (cut up any large pieces), lemon
juice, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Toss well to
coat.
Cover and chill for 2 to 24 hours.  If necessary, stir in a
little milk
till the pasta mixture is creamy.  Makes 6 main-dish servings.

Picnic Hint: Carry the well-chilled salad to the picnic site in a
cooler packed with ice.
