Title: SCALLION PANCAKES
Categories: Chinese, Breads, Loo
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Flour
1/3 c  Water, boiling hot
2 tb Scallion greens, minced
2 ts Lard or Crisco
1/2 ts Salt
4 tb Oil
Mix flour and water. Add a little more flour or a little cold water if
dough is not the right consistency. Knead until smooth. Let rest 15
min. Roll dough into a cylinder and divide into 6 pieces.

Flatten each piece into a 4" circle. Brush with softened fat and
sprinkle with salt and scallions. Roll each pancake into a long thin
spiral and flatten it. Fold this spiral into a square and flatten
again. Roll into a short fat spiral and flatten this to a 4" circle.

Heat 3 T oil and fry each piece until golden (flip once to cook both
sides). Add a teaspoon of oil or so between pancakes if the oil is too
depleted.

Adapted from Wei-Chuan, Chinese Snacks, to the way I do it; but I do
less flattening and rolling.
