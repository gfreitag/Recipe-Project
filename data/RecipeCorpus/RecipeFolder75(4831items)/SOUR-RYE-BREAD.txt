Title: SOUR RYE BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
9 ts Yeast (2 pkg.)
1 1/2 c  Water, warm
2 c  Rye flour,
- medium or stone ground
1 c  Beer, warm
6 c  Flour, all-purpose (approx)
1/4 c  Sugar
4 ts Caraway Seed (optional)
1 ts Salt
1    Egg
3 ts Vegetable oil
1    Egg white;
- beaten with 2 Tsp water
In large mixer bowl, dissolve half of yeast in warm water. Add rye
flour; stir until well mixed.  Cover bowl tightly w/plastic wrap. Let
stand (room temp) for 3 days. Then add remaining yeast & the beer;
mix well. Stir in 3 cups of the all purpose flour, sugar, half
Caraway seed, salt and
the egg, lightly beaten. Beat at moderate speed until smooth,
about 2 min. Add oil; beat at high speed for 2 min. Add enough flour
to make soft dough. Turn dough out onto a floured board. Knead in
remaining flour & knead about 5 min. Place in greased bowl, and let
rise until doubled. Punch down and form into 2 braided loaves. Brush
with egg white/water, sprinkle with Caraway seeds, and let rise
again.    Bake at 350, about 40 min.

You can vary this by using 3 different seeds on the outside of each
braid "rope".  Try poppy seed, sesame seed, and caraway, for a change.
