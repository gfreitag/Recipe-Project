4 oz Cream cheese
1 c  Milk

2 ts Lemon juice

1. In a medium saucepan combine cream cheese and milk. Heat, stirring,
until mixture is smooth.

2. Stir in smoked salmon, peas, onion, lemon juice, and dill. Cook to
heat through.

3. Remove pan from heat. Stir in cheese. Use immediately or cool to
room temperature and refrigerate or freeze (see Timesaver Tip).

4. To serve: Cook 1-1/4 to 1-1/3 pounds fresh or fresh-frozen spinach
fettucine, or 8 ounces dried, following package directions. Drain.
Toss sauce with pasta.

Makes 2 cups (4 main dish or 6 appetizer servings).

* Timesaver Tip: Sauce can be made up to 6 hours ahead, covered, and
refrigerated, or it can be frozen. To freeze, spoon into a freezer
container, cover, label, and freeze at 0 degrees F up to 1 month. To
serve, defrost sauce 15 to 20 minutes in microwave oven on Defrost
setting, stirring several times, or thaw in refrigerator 8 to 24
hours. Gently warm sauce in a saucepan or microwave oven on 50% power
until warmed through, 3 to 5 minutes, whisking frequently and
vigorously to bring sauce to a creamy consistency.
