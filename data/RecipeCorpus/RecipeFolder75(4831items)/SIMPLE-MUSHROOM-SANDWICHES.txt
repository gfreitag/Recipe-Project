Store)

slice mushrooms and onions, sprinkle w/ salt and pepper. Preheat
non-stick skillet until hot enough for onion to sizzle when touching
surface. Add mushrooms, onion, and red wine. Cook on high heat,
stirring frequently, until all liquid has evaporated. Meanwhile,
toast bread. Serve as thick sandwiches. If desired, spread bread with
stoneground mustard prior to making sandwiches (I usually don't, but
nice as a change)
