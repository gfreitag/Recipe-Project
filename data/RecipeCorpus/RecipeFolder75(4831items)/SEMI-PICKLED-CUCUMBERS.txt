Yield: 36 Pickles
Blackcurrant / cherry leaves
36 sm Cucumbers
24    Peppercorns
6    Cloves garlic

2 qt Water
3/4 c  Coarse salt; 6 oz
4 tb Vinegar; optional
"In Russia 'semi-pickled' cucumbers, made at the end of the summer,
kept in brine for three to four days, are particularly popular. In
addition to dill, which is the all important flavour, the container
~- usually an earthenware crock -- is often lined with oak,
blackcurrant or cherry leaves. In Israel vine leaves are used for
this purpose."

Line three 2-lb (1 kg) jars with a few washed and dried blackcurrant
or cherry leaves.

Wash cucumbers, dry, and pack into jars in layers, putting them in
vertically and fitting them in tightly. Sprinkle each layer with
peppercorns and slip a couple of garlic cloves, a bay leaf, and a red
chili between the layers. Insert a couple of good dill stalks in each
jar.

Bring water to the boil with salt, allow this brine solution to cool,
and pour over cucumbers. There should be enough bring to come to
about 1 inch above the cucumbers.

Cover with a well-fitting lid, if necessary put a weight on top. The
cucumbers must not be allowed to float up -- hence the weight. But
you must also make sure that the lid and weight, or whatever you use
for cover, does not press directly on the cucumbers, as this may
cause bruising.

Leave in a cool dry place until ready, which can be from one to three
weeks, dependent on climate. Should there be any evaporation of the
liquid, make up more brine and top up. Allow six tablespoons coarse
salt per quart of water for the brine solution.

If you like the taste of vinegar in your dill pickles, add two
tablespoons of vinegar to 1 quart of bring solution and bring to the
boil together. Then cool and use as described.
