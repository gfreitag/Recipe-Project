MAESTRO COLEMAN'S ATLANTA
PORK CHOPS -- See Below:
One head of red cabbage - cut as with coleslaw - Put in a heavy pot.
Add 1/2 cup of corn oil and cook for 15 minutes. Stir constantly to
avoid burning cabbage. Add 1/2 cup of white vinegar, 1 cup hot water,
1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, 6 cloves. Simmer on low
for 1/2 hour (covered pot).

MAESTRO COLEMAN'S ATLANTA PORK CHOPS Have Butcher cut pork chops
approximately 1 to  1 1/2 inchyes thick. Rub in soy, salt and pepper.
Brown on high heat with two tablespoons of oil. Brown each side one
time only until nicely browned. Then lower the heat. - For 4
porkchops add 3/4 cup of water.  Cover and simmer for 2 hours. Serve
some sour cream on the side.

This combination is especially good with mashed potatoes. In Atlanta
we have a great restaurant called "The Buckhead Diner" They are
gourmet plus and make their mashed potatoes with crushed celery
added. Wonderfully delicious.!
