Title: SHAHI GOBI
Categories: Vegetables, Punjabi
Yield: 1 Recipe
250 g  Cabbage
2 md Onions
6    Garlic cloves
2 tb Ghee or oil
1/2 ts Garam masala
1/2 ts Turmeric powder
1 ts Ground cumin seeds
1 tb Coriander powder
2 tb Yogurt
1 md Tomato; diced
1 1/2 tb Gram flour
1    Handful of sliced coriander
-- (leaves)
Salt; to taste
Chili powder; to taste
Grind onion and garlic to a paste.  Mix together gram flour, salt and
chili powder with enough water to make a thin batter. Cut cabbage
into long, thin slices. Dip cabbage slices in batter and deep fry
until light golden. Drain and set aside. Heat ghee or oil in skillet
and cook onion and garlic paste until golden. Add spices and cook
another minute, then add tomatoes and continue to cook until ghee or
oil begins to separate and rise to the top. Mash mixture with the
back of a wooden spoon, then add 2 cups of water. Bring mixture to a
boil, then reduce heat and add cabbage. Cook until cabbage is tender
and sauce is thick. Garnish with chopped coriander and serve. [I
guess you can add yogurt at the same time as the spices, although I
substituted a bit of lemon juice, and added a couple of cups of water
to this, and it was pretty good. The water seemed to be necessary, as
the sauce was VERY dry otherwise.  -K.M.]
