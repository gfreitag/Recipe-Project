Categories: Lamb, Meats
Yield: 2 Servings
3/4 lb Lamb steak, cut from leg
1/4 c  Red wine
3 tb Red-wine vinegar
1 ts Rosemary, dried
1 md Garlic clove, crushed

Remove fat from lamb.  If the piece is thick, cut it in half
lengthwise so that each piece is about 3/4 inch thick. Mix red wine,
vinegar, rosemary and garlic together in a small bowl. Poke several
holes at varying intervals in the lamb.  Place it and the sauce in a
zipper-lock bag to marinate for 20 minutes. Turn after 10 minutes.
Heat a medium-size non-stick pan.
Remove lamb from marinade and pat dry with a paper towel. Reserve
marinade.  Brown the meat in the hot pan, and saute 3 minutes per
side. Remove to a plate and cover with foil to deep warm.
Add reserve marinade to pan, making sure it comes to a boil. Scrape
up brown bits in bottom of pan and add mint jelly. Heat to serve with
sauce spooned over top.
