Recipe by: Tina Kanagaratnam With a mortar and pestle, or in a food
processor, pound together or puree t paste ingredients and set aside.

Heat the oil in a wok over medium  heat.  Saute the cinnamon,
cardamom, cloves, onion, garlic, and fennel until the onion is
translucent and aromatic, about 5 minutes. Add the curry powder and
continue sauteeing for an additional couple of minutes.

Add the chicken, tomato, and the paste ingredients, mixing well to
coat the chicken.  Continue stirring until the chicken is evenly
cooked and the toma has broken down. Add the cubed potato, and cover
and simmer until the pota is cooked and the gravy has thickened,
about 30 minutes.

Stir in the coconut milk, and heat for a few minutes before serving.

Note: Coconut milk will curdle if it is not stirred while coming to a
boil; stir the mixture constantly until it thickens, then serve. Do
not cover th pan when using coconut milk, as the condensation will
fall back into the pa and may cause curdling.
