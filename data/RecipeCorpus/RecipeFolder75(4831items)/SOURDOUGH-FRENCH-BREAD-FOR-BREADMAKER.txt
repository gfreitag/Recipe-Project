Title: SOURDOUGH FRENCH BREAD FOR BREADMAKER
Categories: Breads, Breadmaker
Yield: 16 Servings
1/2 tb Yeast
2 1/4 c  Flour, bread
1 c  Sourdough starter; room temp
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Water; tepid
Put all ingredients except the water into the machine. Set it for
french bread and start it. Slowly drizzle the water into the machine
while it is running. Stop adding water when the dough forms a rough
ball that cleans the sides of the pan. There should be no wet slime
under the paddle. Let it knead for a while. The dough should get
smooth and satiny. Touch the dough ball. It's okay if it barely
sticks to your finger and feels tacky, but you finger should come
away clean. This dough, not having any fat or oil is always just a
hair stickier than normal white bread. It should not feel too dry. If
it is dry, add a few drops of water. Close the lid and let it do its
thing. After the loaf shaping stage you may mist the dough lightly
with water to give it a crispier crust.

Rye variation: substitute 1/2 cup rye flour for 1/2 cup bread flour.
Add 1 tsp caraway seed.

Note: Feed the starter and let it stand at room temp at least 4 hours
before starting the bread (usually over night) Store starter in the
fridge when not in daily use. I feed it with 1/2 cup all purpose
flour and 1/2 cup water.

Tested in DAK R2D2.  Sylvia's comments: I wanted some sourdough
loaves to take to work for a party, and used this one. I shaped the
dough into 4 long ropes, which by the time they finished rising were
bigger than I wanted. :(  I baked them in a 350 oven for 20 minutes
with a pan of hot water on the bottom rack to get a good crisp crust,
then flipped them over and baked another 10 minutes to get the bottom
crisp too. Came out great!
