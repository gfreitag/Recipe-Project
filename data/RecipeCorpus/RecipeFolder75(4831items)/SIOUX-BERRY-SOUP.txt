Title: SIOUX BERRY SOUP
Categories: Soups, Native amer
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Chuck steak, boned/trimmed
3 tb Peanut oil
1 md White onion, peeled/sliced
2 c  Beef stock (up to 3 cups)
1 c  Blackberries
1 tb Honey
Salt to taste
Broil the chuck steak in the oven until brown on both sides. In the
old days this would have been done over the fire, so you might wish
to quickly barbeque the meat in order to increase the flavor. Set the
meat aside to cool.

In a Dutch oven heat the oil and brown the onions. Cut the meat into
bite-size pieces and add to the pot. Add the blackberries and enough
beef stock to barely cover the meat. Stir in the honey and simmer the
meat, covered, until it is very tender, about 1 hour. If the berries
are too tart add more honey to taste. Add salt and serve in bowls.

Smith recommends servings this with Bacon Corn Bread and Hominy Baked
with Cheese.
