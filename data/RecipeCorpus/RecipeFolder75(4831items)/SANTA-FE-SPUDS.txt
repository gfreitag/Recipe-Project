Title: SANTA FE SPUDS
Categories: Mexican, Potatoes, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lg Russet potatoes
Olive oil, butter-flavored
Nonstick cooking spray
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Dried thyme leaves
2 c  Frozen sweet corn, black
Bean, red pepper, green
Pepper, and celery blend
1    Green onion, finely chopped
1 c  Salsa
1/2 c  Sour cream
1/2 c  Shredded cheddar cheese
Scrub the potatoes thoroughly and pierce with a fork. Bake unpeeled
in a microwave oven on high for 10 minutes. Turn and cook on high for
10 minutes longer; or until the potatoes are soft to the touch. Allow
to cool slightly, or until you can handle them.

Heat a conventional oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly coat a shallow
baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Cut the potatoes in half
lengthwise. Use a spoon to scoop the pulp from the inside of the
potato halves, leaving a 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch shell of pulp inside
the skin. Reserve the pulp.

Spray the insides of the potato shells lightly with the cooking
spray. Bake shells in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly
browned around the edges and slightly crispy. (you can bake the
shells up to two days in advance, refrigerate them and fill before
serving.)

Combine the reserved potato pulp in a large mixing bowl with the salt,
thyme, frozen corn-black bean blend, green onion, salsa and sour
cream. Stir to blend ingredients. Mound the potato-vegetable mixture
in the prepared potato shells and top each shell with shredded
cheese. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and
the filling is hot.
