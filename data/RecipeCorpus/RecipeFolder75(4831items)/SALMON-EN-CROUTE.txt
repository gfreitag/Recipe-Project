Ask your fishmonger to fillet a 2 1/2 salmon and keep the bones and
trimming for the lemon cream sauce.

Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Put the white fish, breacrumbs,
lemon juice and rind, chives, parsley, egg and oil in a food
processor. Whizz until smooth, then season to taste. Roll out the
pastry to a long, oval shape 6 inches longer than the salmon and 2
1/2 times as wide. Place a fillet in the centre of the pastry, spread
over the white fish paste and sandwich with the other fillet. Cut
diagonal lines along each side of the puff pastry about 1/2 inch
apart, leaving 3 inches at each end uncut. Bring the sides together,
criss-cross the cut strips over each other and secure them with
beaten egg. Fold one end into a triangle to make the shape of a fish
head and cut a wedge from the other end to make the shape of a tail
Lift fish on to a greased baking tray. Brush pastry with beaten egg
and bake for 35-40 minutes. The fish is ready when a skewer inserted
between the plaits comes out clean.

Serve on its own or with "Cucumber Sauce (barry)" or "Lemon Cream
Sauce (barry)".
