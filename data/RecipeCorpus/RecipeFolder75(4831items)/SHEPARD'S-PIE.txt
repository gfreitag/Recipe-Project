Title: SHEPARD'S PIE
Categories: Digest, Feb95
Yield: 1 Servings
4    To 5 Potatoes
1    Onion, chopped.
2 c  Lentils
1/2 c  Or more tvp
2    Or more cups frozen veggies
{I use peas, corn, carrots,
Beans}
1 c  Nutritional yeast {I use
Enjivata yeast as well}
1 tb {or more} tamari sauce
1/8 c  Oil*
1/8    Water
2 c  Water
1/2 c  Flour
TO PREPARE: Top layer: Boil spuds & mash** {with soymilk, nutritional
yeast, parsley, minced garlic}. Set aside.

Bottom layer: Cook up 2 cups of lentils in vegetable stock and chopped
onion. When through add enough textured vegetable protein to absorb
the excess water. Set aside.

Prepare nutritional yeast gravy: Toast flour over medium heat, add
yeast, then oil and mix well. Add water. Bring to a boil and use
whisk to get rid of clumps. May want to add more yeast. Add tamari
and gravy flavoring. Cook a few minutes until thickened.

Add to lentil and tvp mixture reserving about 1/2 cup for the top.

In a baking dish {I spray with pam}, spoon in lentil-tvp-gravy
mixture, then put on frozen veggies, then spoon mashed potatoes over
everything. Drizzle with remaining gravy and bake for about a 1/2
hour or more in a 375 degree oven.
