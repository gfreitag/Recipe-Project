Title: SHRIMPLY DELICIOUS *** ELLIE
Categories: Appetizers, Seafood, Party
Yield: 5 Servings
1 lb Large shrimp; (26-30)
1 c  Chili sauce
15 ea Sl Bacon; cut in half
Shell and devein shrimp. Marinate raw shrimp in chili sauce for 1
hour, or over- night.  Wrap  each shrimp in 1/2 piece of bacon and
secure with a toothpick  (I soak the toothpicks in water so they
don't burn).
Preheat oven to  broil  and place shrimp 6-7 inches from heat and
cook for approximately 3-4 minutes or un- til bacon is browned. Turn
over and brown other side. Serve hot. Even though you have to cook
these at the last minute,  the assembly can be done the day before.
They ARE good. FROM: ELLIE COLLIN
