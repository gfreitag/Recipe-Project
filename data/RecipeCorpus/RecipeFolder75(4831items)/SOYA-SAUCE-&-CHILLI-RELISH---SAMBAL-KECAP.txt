Stephen Ceideburg
2 tb Dark soya sauce
1/2    A lemon or 1 lime, juice
-only
2    Cabe rawit, crushed, or:
1 ts Chilli powder
2    Shallots, sliced very thin
1    Clove of garlic, crushed
-(optional)
1 tb Boiled water
This is a very simple sambal, quick and easy to make. It is ideal for
adding just a little piquancy to such dishes as Mie Jawa, any sate
(especially if you don't like peanut butter sauce), and Nasi Goreng.

Mix all the ingredients well together just before serving.
