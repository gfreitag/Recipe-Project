for dough to leave sides of bowl. Turn dough onto well floured board
& knead in enough additional flour to make dough smooth & elastic

pieces. Roll each piece into a 6-" roll abt 3/4 " thick. Pinch the 2
ends together to form a doughnut shape. Boil 4 qts water & add 2 tb
sugar. Drop each bagel into boiling water 1 at a time. Boil only 4 at
a time. Cook until they rise to the top & then turn over & cook for 2
mins longer. [DG NOTE- don't cook longer than 3 mins or they get
tough.] Remove w/slotted spoon & place on greased cookie sheet. When
all have been boiled, put in preheated 375F oven & bake for 20-25
