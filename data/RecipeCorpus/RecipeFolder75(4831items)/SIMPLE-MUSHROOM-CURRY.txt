Categories: Main dish, Stir-fry
Yield: 2 Servings
3 tb Oil
1 ts Curry paste

The simple stir-frying of mushrooms and peas with curry paste and
yogurt makes an incredibly good dish, garnished with that typically
Indian herb, coriander. Serve with basmati rice and some poppadams
and it is a feast.

Heat the oil in a heavy pan and stir in the curry paste and the
onion. Fry gently until soft. Add the mushrooms, turn the heat up a
little and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the peas and mix well. Add
salt to taste and a little water. Gradually stir in the yogurt and
mix well. Simmer over a gentle heat until the sauce thickens and the
mushrooms and peas are well cooked. Stir in the chopped coriander and
it is ready to serve.
