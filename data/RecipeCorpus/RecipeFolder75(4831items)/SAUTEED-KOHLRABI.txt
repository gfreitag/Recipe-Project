2    Good sized kohlrabi; peeled
-- trimmed of leaves
1 ts Salt
1 md Onion; peeled and diced
4 tb Sweet butter

Grate the kohlrabi in a food processor or by hand. Sprinkle with salt
and allow to sit in a colander for

Melt butter in a saute pan.  Brown onions and stir in kohlrabi. Turn
heat to low, cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Uncover and turn up the

Ogden writes: "We enjoy kohlrabi sliced thin and eaten raw, however,
on the cooler nights this sauteed dish is a nice accompaniment to a
main dish."
