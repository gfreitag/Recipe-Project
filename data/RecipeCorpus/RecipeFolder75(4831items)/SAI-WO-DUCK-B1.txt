This dish will require a good deal of time to prepare but will turn
out well.

Rub soy sauce over duckling. Boil enough oil to cover the bird in
large deep-fry pan. Add duck, fry until entire bird is well-browned.
Remove, drain on absorbent toweling. Use sharp cleaver to slash duck
from breast to lower belly. Don't cut through bone. Place duck in
pan, stuff cavity with celery, onion, ginger root, black mushrooms,
orange peel, bamboo shoots, anise, 1 tsp. salt, sugar, pepper, & MSG.
Distribute evenly. Place on platter, elevate in a steamer. Cover,
steam for 2-1/2 hrs. Make sure water is replenished as it evaporates.
Remove platter, allow duck to cool. Discard all ingredients except
bamboo shoots & mushrooms. Save all juices for gravy. Carefully
remove wings & legs. Gently separate flesh from carcass with hands,
starting from slash & keeping skin intact.

Be sure not to make any more holes in skin, & to keep bird in its
natural shape.(Carcass will make good soup.) Spread duck, meat side
up, on a deep platter. De-bone the legs, place w/ wings. Spread
mushrooms & bamboo shoots on duck meat. Replace in steaming utensil &
steam again 20 minutes. Remove. Line large serving platter with
lettuce leaves. Turn platter with duck upside-down so that duck rests
on leaves, skin side up. Pour cooking juices into saucepan. There
should be 2 cups liquid. Bring to boil, on high heat. Add cornstarch,
1 tbs. soy sauce, 1/4 tsp. salt. Stir continuously until gravy
thickens. Pour gravy over whole duck. Garnish with Chinese parsley &
serve immediately.

Chopsticks are recommended.
