~------------- ~-- Rinse and dry ribs; then cut apart. Heat about 3
cups oil in a wok. When very hot, add ribs in small batches and fry
until brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove and drain.

Combine sugar, vinegar, salt and soy sauce. Remove oil from wok;
return wok to stove and turn heat to high. When hot, add vinegar
mixture. Cook, stirring, over high heat until syrupy. Add ribs; toss
in the mixture until well coated. Serve warm or at room temperature.
