Title: SOUTHWESTERN STYLE PINTO BEANS
Categories: Pulses and, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
2 lb Dry Pinto Beans -- soaked
Overnight
1 lg Ham Hocks
3    Jalepeno Peppers -- to
Taste
1 qt Tomatoes, Canned
5    Garlic Cloves -- to taste
2 md Onions -- finely chopped
1 tb Salt -- to taste
2 tb Chili Powder
1 ts Oregano
1 ts Summer Savory
2 tb Sugar
1    Stalk Celery
Soak the pinto beans in water overnight, or about 6-8 hours. Drain the
water and rinse the beans well.

Simmer the ham hock for about 2 hours in enough water to cover; about
2 quarts. (You could also use a pound of side pork or slab bacon cut
into 1 inch chunks.) Remove the meat from the hock and return it to
the cooking pot. Add the pre-soaked and rinsed beans to the pot,
along with the rest of the ingredients. Add enough water or tomato
juice to bring the level to about 4 1/2 quarts total volume. Cover
and simmer for about 4 hours, or longer if you have a slow cooker.
Watch the liquid level while cooking so the beans don't get too dry.

Adjust the hot peppers to suit your taste.
