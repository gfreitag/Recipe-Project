Title: SAGE SPIRAL SCONES
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 12 Cones
8 oz Self-Raising Flour
1 ts Baking Powder
Salt and Pepper
2 oz Butter
4 fl Milk
4 oz Sage derby cheese, grated
2 tb Freshly chopped parsley
Milk to glaze
Set oven to 220C/425F/Gas Mark 7. Lightly oil a baking sheet.

Sift the flour and baking powder into a mixing bowl and season.

Rub in the butter with your fingertips to form fine breadcrumbs. Stir
in the milk and mix to form a soft dough, adding a little extra
liquid if necessary.

Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a
12    inch square.

Sprinkle the grated cheese and parsley over the dough, brush the
edges with milk and roll up like a swiss roll, to enclose the cheese.
Slice into twelve and place, cut side down onto the baking sheet.

Brush the tops with milk and bake for 15 minutes, until golden.
