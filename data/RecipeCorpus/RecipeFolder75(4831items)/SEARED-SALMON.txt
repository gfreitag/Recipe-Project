Title: SEARED SALMON
Categories: Seafood, Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
4    Center-cut salmon fillets,
-skin on, about 8 oz each
1 tb Vegetable oil
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE MARINADE---------------------------
1/2 c  White-wine vinegar
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Brown sugar
3 tb Finely chopped garlic
1/2 ts Salt
As it sears over high heat, the salmon cooks skin-side down. The skin
will become dark and crisp because the sugar crystallizes, imparting
a great flavor.

1. Combine marinade ingredients in a small saucepan and simmer over
medium heat for 30 minutes. Cool.

2. Place the salmon in the marinade and let rest at room temperature
for 30 minutes.

3. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet for 30 seconds over medium
heat. Remove salmon from marinade and place in hot skillet, skin-side
down. Raise the heat to medium-high and cook for 2-3 minutes, lifting
salmon with a spatula to loosen it from the pan.

4. Reduce heat to medium; cover; cook 3-4 minutes, until fish is just
cooked through. Serve immediately.
