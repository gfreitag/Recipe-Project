Title: SALTED EGGS
Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 12 Eggs
1 1/2 c  Rock salt
4 c  Fresh water
12    Fresh eggs, preferably duck
-eggs
Bring water and rock salt to a boil; cool.  Place eggs in a crock or
glass jar.  Pour salt-water mixture over eggs to cover. Cover crock
and let stand in a cool place (not refrigerator) for three weeks.
Remove eggs from salt bath and store them in the refrigerator if not
ready to use immediately. Yolks should be a bright yellow-orange
color and quite firm. The white should be slightly cloudy and still
runny.  Eggs without a firm yolk should be discarded.  To hard cook,
cover with fresh cold water and simmer for 20 minutes.  Shell an
quarter.  Serve with hot rice or congee.

NOTE:  Salted duck eggs may be purchased in mud-pack form or in brine
in Oriental markets.  If in mud pack, scrape off mud, wash well and
proceed with recipe.
