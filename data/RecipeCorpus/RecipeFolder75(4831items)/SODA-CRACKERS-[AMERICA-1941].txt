From 1941, Soda Crackers Without Yeast. Because this is an old
recipe, it's hard to determine how many crackers it makes. The yield
will depend on how big you cut the squares. Preheat oven to 400
degrees F. Sift flour, soda and salt together and cut in the butter.
Add milk. The dough should be quite stiff.  Work it thoroughly for 10
minutes. Roll out on a floured board to about 1/4-inch in thickness
and cut in squares. Punch holes with fork. Place on greased pan and
bake until golden, about 8 to 10 minutes.

NOTE: To make sour milk, place 1 tablespoon vinegar in a cup, add
milk to three fourth cup.
