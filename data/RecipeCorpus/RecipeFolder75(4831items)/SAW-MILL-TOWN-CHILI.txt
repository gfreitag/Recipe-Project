Saute the meat in a large skillet until it is lightly browned all
over. Then add water and simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 or 2 hours.

Then mix chili powder, salt, cumin, garlic, cumin, oregano, cayenne
pepper, black pepper, sugar and paprika in a small bowl, and add to
skillet. Simmer for an additional 30 minutes.  Longer cooking will
cause spices to lose flavor.

Then in a small bowl, mix flour and cornmeal and whisk into chili to
avoid lumps.  Bring mixture back to simmer, stirring to avoid
sticking. Remove from heat.

This may be frozen before addition of flour and cornmeal. You may
have to add 1/4 cup of water for each 3 cups of chili to reheat.
Thaw, reheat on low and add flour and cornmeal mixture as directed
above.
