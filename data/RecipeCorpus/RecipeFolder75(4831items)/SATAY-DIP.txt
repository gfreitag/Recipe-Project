It seems that making "thick" coconut milk is a little involved (I
would guess you don't go out and buy it) and the following is a
condensed and paraphrased version of what she says: "When I refer to
"thick" coconut milk in a recipe, it is made from the first pressing
of the milk or water through the coconut meat..... To obtain 2 cups
of "thick" coconut milk, you'll need 2 cups of coconut (she prefers
to use dried, unsweetened [desiccated] coconut found in health food
shops or Oriental stores) and 3 cups of whole milk. Scald the milk in
a saucepan. Place the coconut in the milk.  Stir and remove from
heat. Let stand until cooled to room temperature, stirring
occasionally. Strain this mixture through a sieve using the back of a
spoon to express as much liquid as possible."
