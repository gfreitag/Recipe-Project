Title: SON OF US NAVY MINCED BEEF
Categories: Beef
Yield: 10 Servings
1 1/2 lb Ground Beef
2 md Onions, chopped
Salt & Pepper to taste
5 tb Flour, approximate
Cooking Oil, as needed
1 cn Whole Tomatoes, dice, 16oz
-undrained
5 1/2 oz Tomatoes Juice
2 c  Hot Water, approximate
Ground Nutmeg to taste
Sugar to taste
Crumble the ground beef into a skillet and brown with the onions. If
beef is very lean, add a tablespoon or two of cooking oil. Salt and
pepper to taste. Add flour a tablespoon at a time, stirring and
cooking each spoonful, before adding the next. The flour must be
cooked to preclude a starchy taste through out. Add enough flour to
absorb the most of the oil.

Stir in the tomatoes and the tomato juice, followed by the water.
Allow to simmer on low heat to thicken. Adjust consistency as
necessary. This recipe should be your basic meat sauce in a gravy of
medium thickness.

Add nutmeg, about 1/2 t, and perhaps sugar, 1/2 t, to adjust taste.
In the NAVY this is served over toast at breakfast. It's also great
on hot dogs!
