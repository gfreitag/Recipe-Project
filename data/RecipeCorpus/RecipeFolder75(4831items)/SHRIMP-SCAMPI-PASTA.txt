12 oz Thin spaghetti or angel hair
3 tb Olive oil

1/2 c  White wine
1/2 c  Bottled clam juice

Bring a large pot of water to a boil for cooking the pasts. Add
salt and pasta and cook for 6 to 8 minutes or until al dente. Drain
and return to the pot to keep warm.
While the pasta is cooking, heat the oil and butter in a large
skillet. Add garlic and shallots and saute' for 2 minutes over low
heat, stirring often. Raise heat to medium, add wine, clam juice and
pepper and simmer for 2 minutes.  Add shrimp, spreading them evenly
over the skillet, and simmer over med-low heat for about 3 min, until
cooked through. Stir in parsley. Taste and add salt if needed.  Pour
sauce over pasta in the pot. Toss gently, but thoroughly, then spoon
out onto serving plates. I serve this with pieces of Cuban or French
bread to dunk in the sauce. Enjoy,
