Title: SLO RISE PITA
Categories: Breads, Tested
Yield: 16 Pita
1 ts Active dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm Water
3 c  Whole Wheat Flour
1 tb Salt
2 tb Olive Oil
3 c  Unbleached All Purpose Flour
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water. One cup at a time,
:
stir in whole-wheat flour. Stir the dough 100 times in the same
direction. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 45 minutes.
Sprinkle salt over the dough and stir in oil. One cup at a
:
time, stir in white flour until the dough will take no more and
cannot be stirred. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work
surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer
the dough to a large, lightly oiled bowl, turn to coat and cover with
plastic wrap,. Let rise until doubled in volume approximately 3
hours. Gently punch down. (The dough can be stored, enclosed in a
plastic bag, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.)
Set a baking stone, unglazed quarry tiles or a lightly oiled
:
baking sheet on the bottom oven rack and pre-heat oven to 450 degrees
F.
Divide the dough into 16 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of
:
dough into a 7-to 8-inch circle that is 1/4 inch thick. Using your
hands or a semolina-dusted pizza peel, carefully transfer the
prepared dough to the heated baking surface. Bake for 2 to 3 minutes,
or until the breads have puffed. (Do not worry if all the breads do
not puff completely; they will still taste delicious.) When baked,
keep breads warm by stacking them and wrapping them in a clean
kitchen towel.
