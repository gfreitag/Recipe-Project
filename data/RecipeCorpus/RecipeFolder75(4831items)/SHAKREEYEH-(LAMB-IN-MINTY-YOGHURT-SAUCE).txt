"This particular lamb dish, cooked in a rich yoghurt sauce and served
with rice or burghol, is a Ramadan favorite. During the Muslim month
of daytime fasting, yoghurt is thought to "cool" a thirsty stomach
and is consumed in every possible delicious manner: in salads and
soups, as sauces for meat-filled pasta and meatballs, and as an
ever-present accompaniment to the main dish."

1. Lightly saute the lamb in 2 tablespoons olive oil, sprinkling with
salt and pepper. Add 2 cups water and salt and bring to a boil. Cover
and simmer for 2 hours, skimming the foam. The liquid with reduce
considerably.

2. For the sauce, saute the onion in the remaining 1 tablespoon olive
oil until soft and transparent. Add the garlic and cook for another
minute.

3. Add 1 cup water to the onion and immediately whisk in the
cornstarch, stirring until it is dissolved completely. Beat in the
yoghurt, whisking in one direction only. Slowly bring the yoghurt
sauce to a boil as you continue to stir. Remove from the heat.

4. Pour the meat, the cooking liquid that remains, and the optional
chickpeas into the yoghurt and gently return to a boil. Simmer for 2
or 3 minutes to blend flavors. Taste and adjust seasoning.

5. Serve over Vermicelli Rice or Vegetarian Wheat Pilaf, generously
garnishing with mint or cilantro.

Variation: Saute the mint and garlic in a bit of olive oil and
drizzle over the cooked dish.
