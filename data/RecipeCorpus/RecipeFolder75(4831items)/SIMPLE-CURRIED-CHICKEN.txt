Canned reduced-sodium chicken broth is convenient to keep on hand.
You can freeze leftover broth from opened cans in small plastic
storage containers in 1/3 or 1/2-cup portions.

Preparation time: 15 minutes. Cooking time: 20 minutes.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large, deep skillet with cover. Add onions,
carrots and garlic. Cook, stirring, over medium heat until vegetables
are golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in apple. Transfer vegetables to
side dish.

Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet. Add chicken and cook over
medium-high heat just until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes.
Sprinkle with curry, cumin, ginger, cayenne, salt and pepper. Stir to
blend well. Add reserved cooked vegetables, broth, grapes and
raisins. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring once or twice, just
until flavors are blended and chicken is cooked through, about 10
minutes.

Remove skillet from heat and gradually stir in yogurt. Do not place
yogurt over heat source or it will curdle. Spoon chicken mixture over
hot cooked rice and sprinkle with peanuts.

Makes 4 servings.
