Title: SODA BREAD (CALLERY)
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  White flour
1/2 c  Bran
1/2 c  Wheat germ
1 tb Brown sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
2 c  Buttermilk
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Mix dry ingredients. Make a well in the
middle and add buttermilk.  Stir just enough to moisten. Turn dough
onto floured board and gently work with hands for about a minute.
Shape into a round loaf and place in an 8" round cakepan. Cut an "X"
across the top of the dough with a knife. Reduce heat to 350 degrees
and bake 55 to 60 minutes. Bread will be done when it sounds hollow
when you rap on the bottom.
