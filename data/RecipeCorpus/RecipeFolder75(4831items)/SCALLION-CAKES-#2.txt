Categories: Chinese, Pancakes, Vegetarian
Yield: 10 Servings
Karen Mintzias
1 lb All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Sugar
2 ts Coarse-grain sea salt
-OR- kosher salt
5    Scallions; coarsely chopped
5 tb Vegetable oil (or more)
Place the flour in a mixing bowl.  Sprinkle evenly with the baking
powder and sugar.  Mix with a wooden spoon. Add the water gradually,
stirring and mixing with the wooden spoon. Knead the dough for 3-4
minutes. Cover it with a damp cloth and leave for half an hour, then
knead again for 2-3 minutes. Divide the dough into ten portions and
form into narrow strips 8-10 inches long.  Flatten the strips with a
rolling pin and ten bands of pancake thickness. Sprinkle each band
with salt and then with chopped scallions.  Roll the bands lengthwise
into long double-thickness spaghetti-shaped strips.  Hold one end of
the strip and turn the other end around in circles until the
concentric rings form themselves around the center into a spiral
pancake.  Flatten the pancake with the palm of the hand.  Repeat
until the dough has been made into ten spiral pancakes.

Heat the oil on the bottom of a large flat-bottomed frying pan. When
hot, lift the handle of the frying pan so that the surface of the pan
is evenly greased. Place the spiral pancakes on the surface of the
pan. Fry over low heat for 2-1/2 to 3 minutes and turn the pancakes
over. Repeat and fry gently until the pancakes are evenly browned on
both sides.
