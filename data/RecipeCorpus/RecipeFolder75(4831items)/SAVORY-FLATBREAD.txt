Categories: Snacks, Breads
Yield: 12 Servings
1 pk Dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water -- (105-115)
1 c  Skim milk -- warmed
(105-115)
2 tb Margarine -- melted
1 tb Honey
2 1/4 c  Flour, all-purpose
1 1/2 c  Flour, whole-grain wheat
3 tb Dried onions -- minced
1 ts Dried rosemary -- crushed
1/2 ts Salt
Vegetable cooking spray
Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes.
Add warm milk, margarine, and honey; stir well. Stir in 2 cups
all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, onion, rosemary, and salt to
form a stiff dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 7 minutes); add enough
remaining flour to prevent dough from sticking to hands. Place dough
in a bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and
let rise in a warm place (85-degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour, or
until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down, and divide into 4 equal
portions, shaping each portion into a ball (cover the remaining dough
while working to prevent it from drying out). Roll 1 ball into a 15 x
12-inch paper-thin rectangle on a baking sheet coated with cooking
spray. Score the dough by making 2 lengthwise cuts and 5 crosswise
cuts to form 18 crackers.  Prick entire surface liberally with a fork
(do not allow to rise). Bake at 300-degrees for 23 minutes or until
lightly browned. Remove from pan; let cool completely on a wire rack.
Separate into individual crackers.  Repeat

procedure with remaining dough.  Store in an airtight container.
