Title: SPECULATIUS COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 6 Servings
2 1/4 c  Unsifted flour
3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground cardamom
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
1/4 ts Ground clovees
1/4 ts Ground mace
1 pn Salt
3/4 c  (1-1/2 sticks) sweet butter
1 c  Confectioners' sugar
1    Egg
1 ts Grated lemon rind
Spicy holiday cookies made with a rolling pin or wooden molds.

NOTE: When unsifted flour is called for, fluff up the flour in the
sack or container with a fork before measuring.

Preheat oven to 350~

Combine flour, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, mace and salt onto
wax paper.

Beat butter with sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy; beat
in egg and lemon rind. Stir in flour mixture, blending well.

Roll out dough, one half at a time, on a lightly floured surface to a
1/4-inch thickness. Use a floured speculatius or springerle rolling
pin (see note #2 below) and roll over dough only once, pressing
designs into dough to an 1/8 inch thickness. Cut cookies apart on
dividing lines. Place cookies, 1 inch apart, on ungreased cookie
sheets. Repeat with remaining dough.

Bake in a 350~ oven for 15 minutes or until cookies are a light golden
brown.

Remove from cookie sheets to wire racks; cool completely.

NOTE 2:  Instead of speculatius rolling pin, you can use speculatius
wooden molds which make larger cookies so the yield will be less.
