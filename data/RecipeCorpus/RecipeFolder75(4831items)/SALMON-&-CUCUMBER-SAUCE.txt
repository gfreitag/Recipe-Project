Cut cucumbers into thin julienne strip after peeling. First cut the
cucumber in half length-wise and scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon.
Cut the halves into quarters and quarters into crosswise strips about
two inches long.  Cut these pieces into matchstick-size julienne.
Next, in a frying pan, heat 3 tablespoons of butter until bubbling.
Add cucumbers and toss over moderately high heat for 2-3 minutes.
Season to taste. Remove from pan, stack strips and cut crosswise into
fine dice. Toss with 1/4 teaspoon each of vinegar, salt and sugar.
Fold in 1 cup sour cream and a sprinkle of minced dill or watercress.

Place the salmon fillets over 2 quarts simmering water mixed with 1
tablespoon salt and 1/3 cup of wine vinegar. Steam for 9-10 minutes.
Remove salmon, cover and let cool for 20 minutes then chill. Discard
poaching broth.

Arrange fillets on a platter with watercress or crisp salad greens.
Spoon the cucumber sauce over them and serve with baked tomatoes,
oven-browned potatoes and a light rye bread.

Serves 4.
