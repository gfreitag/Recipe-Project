* The use of sliced parsnips is optional.

1. Tie parsley and dill springs with thread. Cut the chicken into
serving-sized pieces. Put the chicken and its giblets, discarding the
liver, into very large heavy pot. Add the carrots, onions, parsnips
(if using), pepper, chopped parsley or dill and the tied sprigs. Add
enough water to cover all ingredients. Bring to a boil, then reduce
heat and simmer for 45-60 minutes or until chicken is tender. Skim
off the fat and foam as it rises to surface. 2. When the chicken is
done, remove and discard the parsley and dill sprigs. Using a slotted
spoon, place the chicken and vegetables into a bowl and keep warm in
an oven that has been slightly heated then heat turned off. 3.
DUMPLINGS: Place the flour into a large bowl. In another bowl, blend
together the beaten egg, 1/3 cup chopped parsley, poultry or dried
sage, pepper and milk. Mix well and refrigerate batter until ready to
use. 4. Bring the broth to a boil and lower heat to keep at a slow
boil. Drop the batter by rounded teaspoons into the broth. COVER
tightly and simmer for 15 minutes. Do not remove lid during this
time. 5. Remove dumplings with slotted spoon and add them to the
chicken and vegetables. Spoon some of the broth over all and garnish
with chopped parsley if desired.

Serve immediately with the broth placed into cups for each serving.
