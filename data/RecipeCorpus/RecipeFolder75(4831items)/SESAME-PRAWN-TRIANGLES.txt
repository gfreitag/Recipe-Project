The bread slices should be dry. If they are not, then put them under
a low grill to become crisp without browning.Blanch the pork fat in
boiling water, then drain it thoroughly and chop the fat finely.
Roughly chop, then mash the prawns in a basin. Add the pork fat,
parsley and spring onions, then mix in the cornflour, seasoning,
sugar and sesame oil. Make sure that all the ingredients are
thoroughly combined. Spread the prawn mixture on to the bread in a
thick, even layer, moulding it with your fingers. Press the sesame
seeds on to the prawn mixture to make an even coating. Heat the oil
for deep frying to 190 c 375 F. Add the sesame-coated slices a few at
a time, and fry them until they are golden brown. Drain on absorbent
kitchen paper. Cut the slices into small neat triangles, then serve
them hot. Garnish with a few whole cooked prawns if you like.
