The flaky texture of filo dough combined with a creamy lemon curd
filling makes a great-tasting, low-fat dessert. Rather than using
butter, spray the sheets of filo dough with butter-flavored,
non-stick cooking spray to keep the fat content low. The lemon curd
contains almost no fat. Only a small amount of nonfat egg substitute
and one teaspoon of butter were added to the filling for flavor.

Combine granulated sugar, cornstarch and salt in medium saucepan.
Stir in boiling water until blended. Heat, stirring constantly, to
boiling. Heat and stir until thickened and clear, about 1 minute. Add
some hot cornstarch mixture to egg substitute, stirring until blended.

Return all ingredients to saucepan. Heat and stir over low heat until
slightly thickened, being careful not to curdle mixture. Stir in
butter until melted. Stir in lemon zest and juice. Let cool to room
temperature, then chill.

Place one sheet of filo on cutting board. Spray evenly with
butter-flavored cooking spray. Repeat layering with second and third
sheets of filo dough. Cut stacked sheets into eight strips
lengthwise. Cut strips in half crosswise to make 16. Arrange one
strip of file sheets into each of 16 mini-muffin cups to form nest
shape. Repeat with remaining three sheets filo dough.

Bake at 350'F. 5-7 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire rack
to cool.

Dust filo cups with powdered sugar. Fill with lemon curd. Makes 32.
