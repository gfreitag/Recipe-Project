Recipe by: "C. Baden" <hazel@NETCOM.COM>
Mix ground beef and water until soupy.  Mix in other ingredients.
Simmer, uncovered 3 hours.  Stir occasionally.

Note: Top with grated Cheddar, onions, chili beans or use as sauce
over noodles or spaghetti.

The Cincinatti Chili is, would you believe, an alternative to
spaghetti sauce.  It's mild and sweet (the cinnamon does that), and
won't burn anyone's mouth unless you serve it boiling
