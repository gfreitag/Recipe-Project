Title: SOUR CREAM PANCAKES
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/4 c  Flour, whole wheat
3/4 c  Flour, unbleached
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Baking powder
3/4 ts Baking soda
1 3/4 c  Sour cream
1 tb Honey
2 tb Butter; melted
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 3/4 c  Milk
1    Egg yolk
1    Egg white; beaten well
1 tb Butter
Maple syrup; heated
In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the dry ingredients. In a
separate bowl, mix the sour cream, honey, melted butter, and vanilla
extract. Add the milk and egg yolk. Mix again. Pour the dry
ingredients into the wet and stir well.  Add the beaten egg white and
stir.

Preheat a griddle or fry pan over medium-low heat. When the pan is
hot, add 1 teaspoon of the butter, and quickly spread it over the
surface. Pour 1/2 cup ladle of the pancake batter (for each pancake)
on the griddle/fry pan. Cook the pancakes until bubbles appear on
their surfaces. Flip the pancakes and cook for a 1 to 2 minute(s).
Repeat until all the batter is used, adding more butter as needed to
the pan. Serve with hot maple syrup on the side.
