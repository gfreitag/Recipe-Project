Brown bacon slices in a large heavy skillet over medium heat, then
drain on paper towels.  Sprinkle chicken livers with salt & pepper
and cook in bacon drippings until well browned, removing to a plate
as they are browned.

Add onions and mushrooms to skillet pan and cook, stirring, until
mushrooms are tender and lightly browned. Add garlic, basil, oregano
and savory, then blend in tomato paste, sherry and broth.

Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 10
minutes. When sauce thickens, return chicken livers and any liquid
that accumulated while they stood to sauce and cook just until livers
are heated thru, about 2 or 3 minutes. Adjust seasonings with salt &
pepper. Sprinkle with parsley and serve hot over rice, polenta or
pasta. (Editorial note: After trying all three, I very much prefer
rice with this dish.)

Serves 4.
