-ELAINE RADIS BGMB90B
40    Saltines
1 c  Butter; don't use margarine
1 c  LIGHT brown sugar; not dark
12 oz Chocolate chips
1 c  Nuts; chopped, YOUR choice
This recipe was given to me by a dear friend...who has impeccable
taste, in cooking and friends, <g>! Line up the saltines on a jelly
roll pan that has been LINED with FOIL that makes a bigger rim then
the pan. There should be 5 rows of 8.
Melt butter and add LIGHT brown sugar.  Stir often and bring to a
full rolling boil for EXACTLY 3 minutes.
Pour over the saltines and bake in a 400 oven for 5 minutes.
Sprinkle with chocolate chips and wait until they are almost melted;
spread over all the saltines.  Drop the nuts over top as evenly as
possible.
Refrigerate for two hours and then break up into pieces. Can be
stored in a tin.

Aunt Betty says that you don't have to worry about storing..they'll
NEVER last.  I am going to try these next week.
