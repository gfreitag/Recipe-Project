In Indonesian "kecap" is pronounced "ketchup".  Some folks say this
is the origin of our word for the red stuff.

The "cabi rawit" referred to below are the tiny bird peppers. You
could substitute any hot chili.

This is a very simple sambal, quick and easy to make. It is ideal for
adding just a little piquancy to such dishes as Mie Jawa, any sate
(especially if you don't like peanut butter sauce), and Nasi Goreng.

Mix all the ingredients well together just before serving.
