Title: SALMON SCAMPI WITH WINE
Categories: Main dish, Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Salmon fillets
2 tb Bacon drippings
6 tb Butter or margarine
1    Garlic clove
-- crushed and minced
1/2 ts Oregano leaves
1/2 ts Thyme leaves
1 ts Whole tarragon
2 tb Lemon juice
1/2 c  Dry Marsala wine
Trim fillets to 1-1/2" pieces-uniform thickness. In frying pan,
slowly cook 1-2 strips of bacon, or enough to yield 2 tablespoons
drippings. Remove bacon and use for another dish. Saute the salmon in
the bacon drippings over medium heat, turning gently. Remove to a
baking dish and keep warm. Deglaze pan with a little of the wine and
scrape the residue from the pan over the fish. Meanwhile, in a small
saucepan, melt the butter and add the garlic and spices. Cook,
stirring over medium low heat, for 2-3 minutes to extract the
flavors. Remove from heat and add the wine and lemon juice. Pour this
sauce over the fish. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 10 minutes. Serve
over rice, spooning pan juices over all. Garnish with lemon wedges
and finely chopped parsley.

Variation: Substitute dry white wine for the Marsala for a lighter,
less rich dish.
