non-stick pan, over medium-high heat, stir-fry turkey mixture in 1
teaspoon oil for 4 minutes or until turkey is no longer pink.  Remove
and set aside. Add remaining teaspoon of oil to skillet. Stir fry red
and green peppers for 2 minutes, until slightly softened. Add onions;
cook, stirring constantly, until vegetables are crisp-tender.  Return
