Wine vinegar mixed

Season meat with salt and pepper to taste. Place in large bowl. Bring
wine, vinegar and water to boil. Add garlic, onion, bay leaf,
peppercorns, sugar and cloves. Pour over beef. Cover and refrigerate
12 hours overnight. Remove meat and dry thoroughly.  Dredge meat with
flour. Heat bacon drippings in large, heavy kettle, add meat and
brown on all sides. Add half of marinade. Cover tightly and simmer
until tender (2-1/2 to 3 hours). Remove meat to platter and keep hot.
Thicken gravy with 2 tbs. each of flour and water mixed and stirred
into gravy over fairly high heat. Stir in sour cream.  Pour over
sliced meat. (I actually marinate this recipe for 3-4 days in the
refrigerator....the longer, the more sour!!!) Modified from Joy of
