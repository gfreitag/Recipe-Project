Small bowl

Santa Barbara shrimp, found in the Pacific Ocean, are most prized for
their taste and their size.  They are usually sold with head and tail
intact. However, Gulf shrimp make a good substitute.

1. Remove the heads of the shrimp and peel the shell, leaving the tail
intact.  Season lightly with salt and pepper and set aside.

2. Prepare the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, combine the tomatoes,
shallots, garlic, basil, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.
Stir in the vinegar, lime juice, and 1/2 cup olive oil, and mix well.

3. Heat a 10" skillet and pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive
oil. Over medium-high heat, cook the shrimp, in batches, if
necessary, about 1-1/2 minutes per side. Do not crowd the pan. Do not
overcook -- well-done shrimp will become dry.

Presentation: Spoon vinaigrette into the center of each of 4 plates.
Arrange 4 shrimp on the vinaigrette and garnish with basil sprigs.
Serve immediately.

To prepare ahead: Through step 2, but season the shrimp when ready to
serve.
