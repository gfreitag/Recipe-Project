TO CLEAN THE SHRIMP, remove the feathery legs and blot the shrimp dry
with paper towels. In a small bowl, combine the coarse salt,
peppercorns, and sugar and set aside. In another small bowl, combine
the garlic, ginger, scallions and the chopped chilies. Heat a wok or
deep skillet until it is hot and add the oil. When the oil is very
hot and smoking, add the shrimp and deep-fry for about 1 minute or
until they are pink. Remove them immediately with a slotted spoon and
drain well. Pour off all but 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil and reheat
the wok. Add the salt-peppercorns-sugar mixture and stir-fry for 10
seconds. Add the garlic-ginger-scallion-chiles mixture and stir-fry
for 10 seconds. Return the shrimp to the wok and stir-fry over high
heat for about 2 minutes until the spices have thoroughly coated the
outer shell of the shrimp. Transfer the shrimp to a serving platter
and serve at once.
