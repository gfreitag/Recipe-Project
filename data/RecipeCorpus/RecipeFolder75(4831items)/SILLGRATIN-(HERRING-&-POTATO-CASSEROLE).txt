Categories: Swedish, Seafood, Side dish, Casseroles
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lg Potatoes; peeled, cut into
-1/8" slices
1 lg Onion; thinly sliced
2 1/2 tb Butter
2    Matjes herring fillets; cut
-into 1/2" diagonal slices
Black pepper; fresh ground
1 tb Bread crumbs; fine
1/3 c  Cream; heavy or light
1 tb Butter; cut into tiny bits
Preheat oven to 400Ã¸F. Place potato slices in a bowl of cold water to
prevent them from discoloring. Heat 2 tb of butter in a small frying
pan and, when the foam subsides, add the sliced onions, cooking until
they are soft and transluscent but not brown. Set aside. Choose a 1
to 1 1/2 quart baking dish attractive enough to bring to the table
and using a pastry brush or paper towels, spread with the remaining
1/2 tablespoon of butter. Drain potatoes and pat dry. Arrange
alternate layers of potatoes, herring and onions in the baking dish,
ending with a layer of potatoes. Season each layer lightly with
pepper, sprinkle the top with breadcrumbs and dot with bits of
butter. Pour in the cream, bring to a boil on top of the stove and
then bake for 1 hour in center of oven until potatoes are tender when
pierced with the tip of a sharp knife or skewer. Serve directly from
baking dish.
