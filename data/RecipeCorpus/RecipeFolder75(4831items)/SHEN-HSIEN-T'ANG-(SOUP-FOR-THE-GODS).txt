Yield: 1 Servings
6 c  Boiling water
2 tb Soy sauce

-garlic shoots or
1    Scallion cut into 1/8-inch
-sections
1/2    Ounce finely chopped

1 ts Sesame oil
1 ts Salt
Ran across these three short recipes utilizing ginseng. Thought
someone into herbs and/or Chinese medicinal cooking might find them
interesting. Note the measurement for "a heaping tablespoon vegetable
oil" in the last recipe.  Ginseng must be pretty miraculous stuff if
you can heap tablespoons of oil...

Put seasonings in a bowl and pour the boiling water into it. This is
a good drinking soup that goes well with a heavy dinner.
