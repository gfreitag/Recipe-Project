Title: SNOW ICE
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 24 Servings
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Cream
2 ts Vanilla
Snow, newly fallen
Add sugar to cream, and flavor highly with vanilla or lemon; if lemon
juice is used, more sugar will be required. Stir in newly-fallen snow
until thick as ice-cream, and any kind of fruit juice may be used
instead of cream. In either case the snow must not be added until
just before serving.
