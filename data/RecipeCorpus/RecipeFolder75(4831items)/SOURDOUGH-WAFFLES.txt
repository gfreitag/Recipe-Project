This recipe can be used for either sweet or savory waffles. For a
delicious breakfast or dessert waffle, add either 1 cup fresh or
frozen blueberries or 1 cup peeled, diced peaches, slightly crushed.

You do have to prepare part of this recipe the night before for the
starter to work.

Mix sourdough starter, soy milk, and 1/2 cup of the whole wheat flour.
Cover and let stand at room temperature for 12-24 hours. When ready to
cook, add the remaining 1 cup whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking
powder, and salt. Heat waffle iron, pour in the appropriate amount of
batter for your specific model, and spread to the edges of the waffle
iron. Close and cook until gently browned.
