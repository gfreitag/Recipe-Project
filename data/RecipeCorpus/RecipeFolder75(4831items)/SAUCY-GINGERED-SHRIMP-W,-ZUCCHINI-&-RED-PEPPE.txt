is hot but not smoking, add shrimp and jalapenos; saute until the
shrimp are nicely browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a dish and set
aside.

Reduce heat to medium-high. Add the remaining 1/2 tb oil to the
skillet, then add shallots, ginger, and garlic; saute until the
mixture is soft but not brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in wine and lime
juice; boil until reduced to a glaze, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in stock
and mirin or sherry; boil until reduced to 2 tablespoonsm about 5
minutes. Add tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and simmer for 2
to 3 minutes.

In a small bowl, dissolve cornstarch in 1 tb water; whisk into
simmering mixture and cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens
slightly, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, add scallions,
cilantro, the reserved vegetable mixture and shrimp (with their
juices) to the skillet and just heat through. Season with salt and
pepper.
