Prepare the pasta first (allow about 15 minutes). Bring plenty of
water to a boil in a big pot.  Add a pinch of salt, a dash of oil and
the pasta. Cook al dente; drain; set aside.

Meanwhile, cut onion into 1/4-inch slices, quarter the slices and
separate the rings.  (Pieces should be about the size of a pasta
twist.) Gently drain and rinse the beans. Mince the tarragon. Prepare
accompaniments.

Prepare the sauce (about 15 minutes total) Heat 1 tablespoon of oil
and the garlic in a wok or skillet. Saute the onion over medium to
medium-high until onion is softer and sweeter; about 3 to 5 minutes.
Over medium heat, gently add the drained beans to the onion; season
with salt, pepper, tarragon (as much or as little as you like) and
heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the pasta.  Heat for 3 to 5 minutes.
Remove from heat. Add the bottled vinaigrette made with balsamic and
toss. Serve immediately.

July 3rd - served crumbled gorgonzola as pasta garnish (good) and
seedless red grapes. (Just a pinch of dried tarragon, jar recently
opened.) Canned beans are fragile. Work quickly and gently. Avoid
over-heating.
