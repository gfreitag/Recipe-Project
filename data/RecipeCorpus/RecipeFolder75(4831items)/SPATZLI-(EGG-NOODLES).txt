Title: SPATZLI (EGG NOODLES)
Categories: Swiss, Dumplings, Pasta
Yield: 4 Servings
3 c  Flour; Unbleached
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Nutmeg (optional)
4    Eggs; Large, Beaten
1/2 c  (or more) Water
1/4 c  Butter
Sift flour, salt and nutmeg together in a bowl.  Pour eggs and 1/4 cup
water into middle of flour mixture, beat with a wooden spoon. Add
enough water to make the dough slightly sticky, yet keeping it
elastic and stiff. Using a spaetzle machine or a colander with medium
holes, press the noodles into a large pot full of boiling salted
water. Cook noodles in the water about 5 minutes or until they rise
to the surface. Lift noodles out and drain on paper towels.  Brown
noodles in melted butter over low heat, and serve with a main dish.
Or, don't bother browning them, and serve in/with soup, or with stew.

(Another method for shaping the noodles is to spread the mixture on a
wooden board and cut off little pieces, dropping them in the boiling
water and fishing them out quickly when they're done.)

(Be prepared to write off your first few attempts at spaetzle, by the
way.
They are very labor-intensive, and a little miscalculation with the
time in the hot water can ruin them. One joke I heard about them
while in Switzerland:  Man in restaurant to chef --  "These spaetzli
are terrible!" Chef:  "How dare you!  I've been making them since
before you were born!" Man: "Yes, but did you have to leave them in
the water that long?!")
