1 lb Fresh green olives
2 c  Water

1    Lemon, halved, seeded, and

1. With flat side of meat mallet or rolling pin, crush each olive
just to crack the flesh. Place cracked olives in 1-quart jar. Add
enough cold water to cover olives and insert a small, sealed plastic
food-stor- age bag filled with 1/4 C water to keep the olives
immersed. Seal jar; refrigerate 3 weeks, changing water in jar every
day.

2. After 3 weeks, sample an olive-it should be only slightly bitter.
Continue to soak olives in water if still very bitter.

3. When olives are ready, in 1-quart saucepan, heat 2 C water to
boiling. Add salt and stir to dissolve. Set brine aside to cool to
room temperature.

4. Drain olives and rinse in cold water: Place cured olives in clean 1
~quart jar. Cover olives with cooled brine. Stir in vinegar, lemon
cubes, oregano, and garlic. Top with olive oil and seal jar. Refrig-
erate olives at least 1 month to develop flavor. Olives will keep for
2 more months refrigerated. Drain before serving.
