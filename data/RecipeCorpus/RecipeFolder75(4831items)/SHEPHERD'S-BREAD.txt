Title: SHEPHERD'S BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 2 Loaves
1 c  Milk
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Salt
4 tb Butter
2    Envelopes Dry Yeast
1 1/2 c  Water
8 c  Flour
Scald the milk in a saucepan. Cool slightly. Stir in the sugar, yeast
and butter. Cool. Add the yeast to the warm water in a second bowl.
Stir until the yeast is dissolved. Add the cooled milk. Stir. Stir in
half the flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough additional flour to
make a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a well floured board.
Knead until smooth and elastic (10 minutes or longer). Place in a
greased bowl. Turn to grease the top. Let rise until doubled in bulk.
Punch the dough down. Let rest for 10 minutes. Divide the dough into
loaves. Shape each into a ball. Set each ball on a greased baking
sheet. Let rise until doubled in bulk. Preheat the oven to 400
degrees. Bake until the loaves sound hollow when tapped on the bottom
(about 20 minutes).
