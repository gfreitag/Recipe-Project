NOTES: Here's a recipe, given to me from my sister in N.J.,years ago,
and it's very easy to make and tasty too. Since my six-year-old
daughter asked me to make this dish again, days ago, I made it for
this evenings dinner. She's crazy about taco's and corn chips so
that's why this dish is one of her favorites. :)
