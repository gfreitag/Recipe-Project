Title: SOYSAGE (BROWN)
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Servings
4 c  Soy pulp (from making
-soymilk) or cooked cracked
-soybeans
2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 c  Wheat germ
3/4 c  Oil
1 1/4 c  Soymilk (or other liquid)
1 c  Nutritional yeast flakes
1 1/2 ts Fennel seed
1 ts Black pepper
1/4 c  Soy sauce
3 ts Oregano
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cayenne
2 tb Brown sugar
2 tb Garlic powder
2 tb Wet mustard
2 ts Allspice
Mix ingredients together. Oil oven-proof bowl or empty tin can. Fill
it & cover with foil. Steam on rack for 1 1/2 hours, or pressure cook
in 5 cups water for 30 minutes. Let cool, then slice and fry.

Here, in Louisiana, we like things spicy, so I add a little more
cayenne and mustard and some finely chopped onion and garlic to boot.

Enjoy!
