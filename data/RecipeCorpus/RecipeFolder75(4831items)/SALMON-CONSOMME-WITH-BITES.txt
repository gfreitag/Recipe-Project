Title: SALMON CONSOMME WITH BITES
Categories: Soups, Fish
Yield: 2 Servings
213 g  Canned red Alaska salmon
100 g  Whole prawns
600 ml Vegetable stock
1 sm Onion
-- un-peeled and quartered
1    Bay leaf
2    Egg whites
8    Thin slices of carrot
-- blanched
-- and cut into flowers
2 tb Sherry, optional
Drain the juice from the can of salmon into a saucepan. Break the
fish into flakes putting the bones and skin into the saucepan with
the juice but setting the flakes to one side.

Peel the prawns. Put the heads and shells into the saucepan and set
the prawns to one side with the salmon flakes. Add the vegetable
stock, onion and bay leaf to the saucepan. Bring to the boil. Reduce
heat, cover and simmer for 45 minutes. Remove the consomm√© from the
heat and strain it into a jug through a sieve which has been lined
with damp muslin. Wash out the pan and return the consomme to the
saucepan, once again passing it through a sieve, lined with clean,
damp piece of muslin.

Whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Place the consomme
over moderate heat and bring to the boil. Whisking gently, add the
egg whites, a spoon at a time into the stock. When the mixture boils,
simmer gently for 10 minutes, without breaking the crust of egg white
which will form over the top.

Allow to stand for 5 minutes before straining it for a final time
through a sieve lined with dampened muslin. Re- heat the soup before
serving in bowls along with the flakes of salmon, shelled prawns,
carrot flowers and sherry, if used.
