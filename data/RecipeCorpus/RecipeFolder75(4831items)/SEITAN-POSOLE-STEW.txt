Categories: Vegetarian, Stews, Main dish
Yield: 1 Stew
1 c  Dried posole or canned
-hominy
4-8 cups of water
1 ts Sea salt
1 ea Bay leaf
3 ea Dried chipotle chiles
1 tb Chili powder (optional)
2 tb Corn or olive oil
1 tb Whole cumin seed
1 ea Onion, finely diced
5 cl Garlic, minced
1/2 c  Chopped jalapeno peppers
2 c  Cooked seitan, cubed
1 tb Mexican oregano
1 ts Sage
2 tb Fresh lime juice
To prepare posole: rince dried posole and soak overnight (or up to 24
hours).  Rince and place in heavy pot with enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil, then add sea salt, chipolte chiles and bay leaf.
Cook for 3-4 hours, until tender, adding water as necessary. You can
also pressure cook posole for one hour and simmer for an additional
hour. The goal is to have the posole kernels split open and tender in
a gently flavored broth.

To prepare stew: saute cumin, onions, garlic and jalapenos in oil
with a pinch of sea salt.  When cumin is fragent and onions are
translucent, add seitan cubes and continue to saute until seitan is
seared. Add oregano and sage and saute for one more minute. Add
mixture to posole and continue to cook for one hour. Taste and adjust
seasonings about ten minutes before finishing.  Add lime juice 5
minutes before finishing. Garnish with chopped tomatoes, avocado and
cilantro. Serve with warm tortillas.

Cook's note: when using canned posole or hominy, pre-soak the
chipotles and chop finely before adding with bay leaf and salt. Cook
for one hour before proceeding with the stew directions.
