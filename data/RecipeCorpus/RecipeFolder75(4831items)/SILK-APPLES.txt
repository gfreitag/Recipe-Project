Title: SILK APPLES
Categories: China, Desserts
Yield: 6 Servings
3    Apples
2    Egg whites
2 tb Flour
2 tb Cornstarch
Peanut oil for deep frying
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Honey
1/3 c  Water
1 tb Peanut oil
Quite an experience to eat - the apples is still warm and soft, the
top is crunchy and icy.  Great after a wok dinner.

Peel the apples, core and cut into wedges about 1/2 inch thick. Whip
egg whites until frothy.  Add flour and cornstarch and beat into a
smooth batter. Heat the oil to 375F. Dip each apple wedge into egg
white batter, place in hot oil and try, a few at a time, until crisp
and brown. Place in a single layer on a warm service platter. Bring
remaining ingredients to a boil in a saucepan and cook to a hard ball
stage syrup; 280 F on candy thermometer.  Pour over apple wedges and
serve at once, accompanied by a large crystal bowl of water
containing lots of ice cubes. Each person picks up an apple wedge
with a fork or small tongs and dips it into the ice water to
crystallize the sugar and harden the top, which forms silk-like
threads....hence the name. Serves 6.
