Categories: Appetizers, Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 lb Salmon fillets skinned
Flour, for dredging
1 tb Vegatable oil
1 tb Butter
Seasoning
Cooked buttered spinach to
Serve
**For the chive sauce**
250 ml Double cream
1 ts Dijon mustard
1 ts Prepared english mustard
1 ts Creamed horseradish
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 tb Snipped fresh chives
**For the crust**
2 tb Creamed horseradish
1    Egg yolk
3 1/2 oz Course fresh breadcrumbs
1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1. Make the sauce: Boil the cream in a pan for 2 minutes until
slightly thickened.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the dijon and
English mustards, horseradish and lemon juice; cover and set aside.

2. Prepare the salmon: if there are any bones remaining, remove them
with a pair of tweezers.  Cut the fish into 4 equal portions, season
each piece and dredge with the flour.

3. Prepare the crust: mix the horseradish and egg yolk on a plate.
Dip the top of each piece of salmon in the horseradish mixture (or
brush it on with a pastry brush), making sure that it is generously
coated. Mix together the breadcrumbs and parsley and dip the coated
side of the fish in the mixture. Using your hands, shape the crust by
gently but firmly manipulating the coating mixture.

4. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.  Heat the oil in a heavy-based
frying pan until very hot.  Add the salmon, crust side down, and the
butter and cook for about 3 minutes until the breadcrumbs are turning
nicely crisp. Turn over the salmon and place, crust side up, in an
ovenproof dish. Bake in the oven for 5 minutes, then remove and check
that the salmon is cooked.

5. Add the chives to the sauce.  Reheat briefly over a low heat, but
do not allow to boil as this will spoil the flavour.

6. Lay a bed of buttered spinach on each of four warmed plates and
top with salmon.  Surround the salmon and spinach with the sauce and
serve immediately.
