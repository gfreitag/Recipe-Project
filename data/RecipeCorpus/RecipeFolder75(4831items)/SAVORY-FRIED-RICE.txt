Title: SAVORY FRIED RICE
Categories: Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 c  Long grain rice
6    Whole cloves
3    Whole black peppers
1/4 ts Turmeric
1/2 ts Salt
2 1/2 c  Water
1/2 ts Ground cardamom
2    Leeks (small)
2 tb Margarine
1    Carrot (medium), shredded
1 c  Frozen peas, thawed
1/4 c  Cashews
1/4 c  Raisins
Place rice, cloves, black peppers, turmeric, salt, cardamom, and
water in a 2-qt. pan.  Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.
Reduce heat to low and simmer about 20 minutes until the rice is
tender and the liquid is absorbed.  Remove cloves and black peppers
(or be prepared to warn your guests to watch out for them while
eating). While rice is cooking, wash and trim leeks.  Cut crosswise
in 1/2" thick slices, using the tender parts of the green tops as
well as the white. Separate into rings. Melt margarine in a wide
frying pan.  Add leeks and shredded carrot and cook, stirring
occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add peas, cashews and raisins and cook
for 3 minutes. When rice is cooked, stir in leek mixture. Turn onto a
serving platter and garnish with slices of 3 hard-cooked egg and
parsley if desired. Per serving, including eggs (which I don't use):

Notes: I leave out the eggs and steam the leeks and carrots in the
microwave, thus cutting out most of the fat and all of the
cholesterol.
