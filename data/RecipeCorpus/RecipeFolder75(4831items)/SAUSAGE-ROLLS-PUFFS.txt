Title: SAUSAGE ROLLS PUFFS
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 90 Servings
1 lb Puff Pastry
1 lb Sausage meat - well-seasoned
Number of Servings:  90

Roll the puff pastry into a rectangle 15-1/2 x 9 inches and cut the
rectangle into three strips, each 3 inches wide.

Divide the sausage meat into thirds and roll each into a "snake" the
length of the pastry.  Place each roll of sausage along one edge of a
pastry strip.  Roll the pastry around the sausage and wet the edges
with ice water and press to seal tightly.  Chill the rolls for at
least an hour.

Preheat the oven to 400F.  Cut the sausge rolls into 1/2-inch slices
and put them on parchment-covered baking sheets. Bake until the
pastry is puffed and golden brown, about 12 minutes. Serve warm, or
reheat immediately before serving.

NOTE:  The sausage rolls can be sliced and frozen before they are
cooked. To bake, preheat the oven to 400 F and cook the frozen puffs
as above.
