Jewish inns used to specialize in pickled vegetables and preserves.
Many houswives in the SHTETL and ghettoes also made pickle and jams
to supplement the family income. Being frugal, they did not throw
away the pickling juice but used it to flavor and sour many dishes,
especially soups.

SALT DILL PICKLES

My mother, a superb pickler, maintains that the crunchiness and good
green color of pickled cucumbers are achieved by first pouring
boiling water over the cucumbers, blanching them for a few seconds
and then refreshing them immediately with cold water.

Wash and blanch the cucumbers. Refresh and arrange in a crock or a
large glass jar in layers, interspacing them with dill, garlic and
spices. Pour cold water, to cover, over the cucumbers in the crock.
Pour out the water into a measuring jug. Salt with 1 tb (30g/1oz)
salt for each 2 cups water (500ml/1pint). Dissolve the salt well in
the measured water and pour over the cucumbers. Place vine leaves on
top, then fit a heavy plate or wooden cover inside the crock and
place a weight on to hold the cucumbers submerged. Leave in a
warmplace to ferment. Skim as needed during the fermentation period.
When bubbles disappear, the pickles are ready use; this can take up
to 2 weeks or in a warm, sunny place it can take as little as 4-5
days. When fermentation stops, keep the pickles in a dark, cool place
or refrigerate.
