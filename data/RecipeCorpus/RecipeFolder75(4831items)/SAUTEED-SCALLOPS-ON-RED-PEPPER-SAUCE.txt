TO MAKE THE SAUCE: Place the garlic, pepper and 1 tablespoon of
yogurt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, and
puree until smooth. Scrape the mixture into a small bowl and stir in
the remaining yogurt, coriander and black pepper. Whisk in the olive
oil, then spoon the sauce onto plates, spreading it out with the back
of a spoon. FOR THE SCALLOPS: Spray a medium-sized skillet with the
non-stick coating. Add the olive oil, and heat until hot but not
smoking. Add the scallops and quickly saute them over high heat until
just cooked through, turning often, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the
vermouth and let it almost evaporate, then add the lemon juice,
cooking a few seconds longer so the scallops are glazed. Spoon them
onto the plates with the sauce. Sprinkle a few coriander leaves on
top and serve at once.
