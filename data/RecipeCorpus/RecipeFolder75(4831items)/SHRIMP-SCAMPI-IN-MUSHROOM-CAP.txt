1/2 lb Butter; softened
6 c  Garlic; peeled & chopped s
2 tb Parsley; freshly chopped
50    Shrimp;  tiny
Mix butter, garlic & parsley together. Season w/salt & pepper to
taste. Buy mushroom caps that are all about the size of a half
dollar. Wash, remove stems & set stems aside for another use. This
recipe will fill about 50 mushroom caps.

Put butter mixture into a pastry bag with a star tip. Buy 1 tiny
shrimp for each cap or cut a larger one in half. Peel & devein shrimp
and insert it (either the half or the whole shrimp) in the mushroom
cap. Pipe a small rosette of the butter into---> each mushroom cap.
If there is any butter left, just squeeze it onto the cookie sheet
you will be baking these on.

Bake in a preheated, 400 degree oven for 15-20 minutes or until the
shrimp is pink and butter is all melted. Serve these on a slice of
French or Italian bread (to soak up that butter!) BE SURE YOU MAKE
ENOUGH OF THESE--THEY ARE FABULOUS!

NOTE:  and they ARE delicious!
