Title: SCAMPI IN VERMOUTH
Categories: Seafood, Holidays
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Shrimp, shelled & deveined
1/3 c  Olive oil
2    Cloves garlic, minced
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/2 c  Dry vermouth
2 tb Chopped parsley
3 tb Freshly squeezed lemon juice
Saute shrimp in olive oil until they begin to color pink. Add garlic,
salt, pepper and vermouth.  Cook on high heat so the vermouth reduces
to half. This must be done quickly so shrimp do not dry out - total
cooking time should not exceed 4 minutes.

Sprinkle with parsley and lemon juice and serve. Yield: 6 servings
