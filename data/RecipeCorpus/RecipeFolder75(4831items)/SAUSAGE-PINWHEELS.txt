Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 Servings
2 c  All purpose flour
1 ts Salt
2/3 c  Milk
1 tb Baking powder
1/4 c  Shortening
1 lb Hot bulk sausage
Combine flour, baking powder and salt.  Cut into shortening until it
resembles coarse meal.  Add milk; stir and blend. Turn out on floured
surface and knead 3 or 4 times. Roll dough into a 18x12 inch
rectangle. Spread sausage (at room temperature) over dough, leaving
1/2 inch margin on all sides.  Roll dough lengthwise (jelly roll
fashion) and pinch seams and ends to seal.  Cover and refrigerate at
least 1 hour. Slice 1/4 inch thick and bake at 350 degrees for 20
minutes. Randy Rigg The Pinnacle Club BBS 812-963-9139
