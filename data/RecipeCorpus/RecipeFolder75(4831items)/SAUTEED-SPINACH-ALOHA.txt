Title: SAUTEED SPINACH ALOHA
Categories: Vegetable
Yield: 6 Servings
2 lb Fresh spinach -- washed and
Trimmed
3 tb Vegetable oil -- or less
1/4 c  Chopped macadamia nuts
2 ts Fresh ginger root -- grated
2    Cloves garlic -- minced
2 tb Soy sauce, low sodium
1 1/2 ts Rice wine vinegar -- to
Taste
Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Have ready a large bowl of ice
water. Blanch spinach for 1 minute in the boiling water, then quickly
remove it and plunge it into the bowl of ice water. This quick
process preserves the bright green of the spinach and keeps it from
overcooking. Drain the spinach well, then squeeze out as much
moisture as possible. Transfer the spinach to a cutting board and
coarsely chop it. Heat oil in a large skillet. Add the macadamia
nuts. Saute the nuts until they just begin to brown, about 1 minute.
Add the ginger and garlic. Saute about 30 seconds longer. Do not
allow the garlic to brown. Add the spinach and soy sauce, and saute
2-3 minutes longer, until the spinach is heated through. Remove from
heat, splash with rice vinegar, and serve immediately. Alternative:
Brown the nuts in a dry pan and remove. Heat 1 or 2 teaspoons of
canola oil and warm the ginger and garlic. Continue as directed in
the original version. [mcRecipe 19Au96 patH] Recipe By
