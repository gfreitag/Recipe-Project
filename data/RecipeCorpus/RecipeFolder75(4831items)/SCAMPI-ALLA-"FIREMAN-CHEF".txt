Title: SCAMPI ALLA "FIREMAN CHEF"
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 46 Servings
1 lb Large prawns (not 1 oz!)
8    Sprigs fresh parsley
1/3 c  Clarified butter
4 tb Minced garlic
6    Scallions thinly sliced
Juice of one lemon (approx.
2 tbs.)
1/4 c  Dry white wine
Salt and freshly ground
Pepper, to taste
Lemon slices for garnish
Shell and devein the prawns. Rinse and set aside. Reserve a few nice
sprigs of parsley for garnish and mince the rest. Heat the clarified
butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Lightly saute the
garlic for 1 to 2 minutes, being careful not to let it brown. Add the
prawns, scallions, lemon juice, and wine. Cook the mixture until the
prawns turn pink and firm, a minute or two on each side. Be careful
not to overcook. At the last minute, add the minced parsley and
season with salt and pepper. Serve the scampi on individual shells or
small gratin dishes, garnished with a slice or two of lemon and a
fresh parsley sprig. Oseland's Country Gourmet Gourmet foods, gift
