NOTES:

*  Aunt Georgie's chocolate cake -- Don't cry over sour milk; make a
chocolate cake out of it. This cake is from the "Farm Journal's Choice
Chocolate Recipes" cookbook, and was originally posted to net.cooks by
kathyd@azure.
It is moist and rich and does not need frosting Mint chocolate ice
cream and a slab of this cake makes an outrageous dessert.

*  To sour sweet milk, place about 1 T vinegar in a measuring cup and
add enough milk to make about 1 cup.
