Title: SHRIMP SAUCE MIXED VEGETABLES & SHREDDED CHIC
Categories: Chinese, Chicken
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Mung bean sprouts
8    Nami dried black mushrooms
1 lg Green bell pepper
1/2    Stewed chicken breast
8    Green onions
1 ts Fresh ginger root
2 tb Peanut oil
3/4 c  Rich chicken stock
1 tb Medium sherry
1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Shrimp sauce
1 ts Thick cornstarch paste
A delicious vegetable dish.

Preparation:  Wash and soak mushrooms in warm water for 45 minutes;
remove stems; slice caps in thin strips. Wash bell pepper; slice in
half lengthwise; slice in long, thin strips. Remove chicken meat from
bone; pick meat apart into shreds.  Wash green onions; cut off roots
and discard; shred green tops and whites. Peel and slice fresh ginger
root into thin matchsticks.  Rinse bean sprouts to remove any loose
pieces.

Place bean sprouts and sliced pepper in colander in a larger bowl.
Pour boiling water over vegetables to cover. Steep for 2 minutes.
Remove colander from hot water; flush vegetables with cold water.

Stir-frying:  Heat oil in wok until it just begins to smoke. Stir-fry
mushrooms for 30 seconds.  Add chicken and ginger sticks; stir-fry
another 30 seconds.  Push ingredients up side of wok. Add stock,
sherry and sugar; bring to boil; then add shrimp sauce and cornstarch
paste; stir liquids until fairly thick. Return vegetables, plus bean
sprouts and peppers. Stir-fry for another minute until everything is
hot. Add green onions. Serve.  Gravy will tend to thin as sprouts
give off liquid, so be sure it is thick to start.
