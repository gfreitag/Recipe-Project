Categories: Fish, Oriental, Sauces
Yield: 6 Servings
MMMMM----------------------BLACK BEAN SAUCE---------------------------
3 tb Salted fermented black beans
3    Garlic cloves; chopped
1 ts Minced peeled ginger
2 tb Soy sauce
2 tb Dry vermouth
1/2 ts Sugar
6    Green onions
6 sl Fresh peeled ginger
-(quarter-sized), shredded
6    Salmon steaks (1" thick)
- blotted dry
2 ts Salt
4 tb Peanut or corn oil
White pepper to taste
Handful of fresh coriander
-(leaves)
SOAK BLACK BEANS in lukewarm water for 5 minutes. Drain, rinse with
cold water; drain. Combine black beans with garlic, ginger, soy
sauce, dry vermouth and sugar; gently mash together. Cut 3 green
onions into 2-inch-long sections and cut 3 into 2-inch-long slivers.
Put green onion sections and half the shredded ginger on bottom of a
shallow heatproof plate (like a glass Pyrex pie plate). Sprinkle
salmon with salt. Place salmon steaks in a single layer on top of
green onions. You may need to use 2 plates with a 2-tier steamer
unit. Scatter remaining shredded ginger. Top each steak with 1/2
tablespoon of the black-bean mixture and half the green onion slivers
equally over the steaks.

Fill a wok or steamer with enough boiling water to come within 1 inch
of the bottom of bamboo steamer. When the water comes to a boil, put
the fish with its plate into the bamboo steamer. Cover. Steam over
medium-high heat for 10 minutes. When done, remove cover away from
your face and carefully lift out the plate. In a small pan heat the
peanut or corn oil until hot and almost smoking. Sprinkle salmon with
white pepper and scatter the remaining fresh green onion slivers on
top. Carefully pour the hot oil over the fish steaks. It should
sizzle. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with steamed
rice.
