Title: SALMON PATTIES
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 lb Salmon, canned
-(either pink or red)
1 pn Salt
1 sm Onion, diced
1/4 c  Bread crumbs,
-plain or spiced
2    Eggs
1 ts Lemon juice
Mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl.  Form into patties
about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick and 2 1/2 - 3 inches diameter. This
should make about 8 patties. Fry in oil or butter until brown and
crispy, or bake in a well-greased pan at 400 degrees until brown
(about 15 minutes).

NOTES:

*  Snack or Main Course -- This is a very nice finger food, great for
lunch on a hike. Or they can be served hot as a main course.

*  I usually make a double batch.

*  These are great either hot or cold.  If you take them out of the
freezer in the morning and put them in your backpack, they'll be just
right by lunchtime.

: Difficulty:  easy, especially if you like squishing stuff with your
hands.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
