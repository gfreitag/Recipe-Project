750 g  Tripe
1    Lemon (juice only)
Water
2 tb Butter
1 lg Onion; chopped
1/4 c  Chopped parsley
1/4 c  Tomato paste
1 c  Water
1/2 c  Dry white wine
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Chopped parsley to garnish
Serves: 4-5 Cooking time: 2 1/4 hours

Wash tripe well, drain and cut into small squares or fingers. Place
in a dish, add lemon juice, stir and leave for 1 hour. Place tripe in
pan, add water to cover and bring to the boil. Drain off water and
remove tripe to a plate.

Clean pan and add butter.  Melt over medium heat and add onion. Fry
gently until transparent.  Stir in parsley, fry 1 minute, then add
tomato paste, water, wine and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a
slow simmer.

Return tripe to pan, cover and simmer gently for 2 hours or until
tripe is tender.  To test for tenderness, take out a piece and pull.
If it breaks apart easily, tripe is cooked.

Place in a serving dish, garnish with parsley and serve hot with
pilaf and a tossed salad.
