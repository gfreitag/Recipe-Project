the tip of a knife.  Insert a red pepper deep into each opening, so

hours. The daikon's moisture will reconstitute the pepper and the
pepper will have spiced the daikon.  Grate the daikon, divide into 6
equal parts, and roll into a small ball. TO SERVE: Pour the pon-su
(equal parts soy-sauce and lemon juice) and add a ball to each dish.
