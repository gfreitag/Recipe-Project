Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 c  Unskinned tomatoes, diced
3/4 c  Finely chopped white onion
6    Serrano chilies, finely
-chopped
1/3 c  Chopped cilantro
1/2 ts Salt, or to taste

This particular salsa is meant to be eaten fresh as it does not
freeze well & looses its eye appeal by the second day.

(use just enough to moisten the tomatoes and yield the desired
texture)

Mix together all ingredients and set aside at room temperature for
about 30 minutes before using.
