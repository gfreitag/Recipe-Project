Categories: Dupree, Vegetable
1 TB olive oil
Yield: 4 Servings
2    fennel bulbs -- thinly
sliced
:
4    zucchini -- sliced
1 TB balsamic vinegar
1 TB chopped fresh oregano
Salt and pepper
:
1/4 c  toasted pine nuts

In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the
fennel and zucchini and cook, stirring constantly until the
vegetables are cooked through but still crisp-tender, about 7 to 8
minutes. Stir in the vinegar and oregano and season to taste with
salt and pepper. This can be made ahead and reheated at this point.
Add the pine nuts and cook over medium heat for 2 minutes longer.
Serve hot. Yield: 4 to 6 servings
