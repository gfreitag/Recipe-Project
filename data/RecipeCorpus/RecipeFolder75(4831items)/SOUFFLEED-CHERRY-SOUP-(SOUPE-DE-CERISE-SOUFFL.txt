By 'soup' Fredy Girardet means what many peoples would call a compote.

One day in advance, put 400 g (14 oz) stoned cherries into a frying
pan with the butter. Cook them gently until the juice runs. Add the
sugar and continue cooking until the sugar slightly caramelises. At
this point, pour in a generous dash of kirsch and flambe it. Take the
pan off the stove.

Put the cherries into a strainer to drain them, and keep the juice.

Just before serving, pre-heat the oven to 260 oC (500 oF).

Divide the cherries between four little souffle dishes 6 cm (2 3/8
in) in diameter and just cover them with their juice.

Prepare the souffle mixture. Put the egg yolk into a basin with 35 g
(1 1/4 oz) sugar. Beat it until it becomes pale and fluffy. Add half
a tablespoon of lemon juice.

In another basin, whisk the egg whites to firm peaks with the rest of
the sugar, then fold in a tablespoonof lemon juice. Fold the whites
delicately into the yolk mixture using a spatula.

Top up the moulds with the souffle mixture.

Bake the souffles at the bottom of the pre-heated oven for 5 minutes.

Serve IMMEDIATELY.
