Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 3 Servings
2    Italian sweet sausages
1/4 ts Fennel seeds
pn Red pepper flakes (optional)
1/4 c  Yellow onion, minced
1    Garlic clove, minced
Olive oil, as necessary
1/4 c  Parsley, chopped
1/4 c  Black olives, chopped
1/3 c  Bchamel sauce, thick
Salt & pepper
12    Mushrooms, large
Parmesan cheese
Remove sausage meat from casings and crumble into a small skillet.
Saut gently, stirring often, until meat is thoroughly done. Season
with fennel and, if desired, red pepper flakes. With a slotted spoon,
remove sausage to a bowl, leaving the rendered fat in the skillet.
Saut onion and garlic in the fat, adding a little olive oil if
necessary, until tender and golden, about 25 minutes. Stir in chopped
parsley and add to reserved sausage meat.
Stir (imported) olives and bchamel into the sausage mixture;
combine thoroughly. Taste the mixture and season with salt and pepper
if necessary.
Pull the stems off the mushrooms and save for another use. Wipe
mushroom caps with a damp cloth and season lightly with salt and
pepper. Fill each cap generously with the stuffing. Arrange caps in a
lightly oiled baking dish. Sprinkle the tops of the stuffing with
Parmesan cheese to taste.
Bake at 450øF. for about 15 minutes or until bubbling and well
browned. Let settle for 5 minutes before serving.
