Title: SOUR BEER RYE~ 1 1/2#
Categories: Breads, Abm
Yield: 1 Loaf
1 c  Beer, flat, room temp
1/4 c  Cider vinegar
1 1/4 c  Bread flour
1 c  Whole rye flour
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 c  Gluten flour
1 ts Dill weed, dried
1 1/2 ts Sea salt
2 ts Caraway seeds
2 tb Oil
1 tb Honey
4 ts Active dry yeast
Combine the beer and the vinegar in a small bowl
and set aside for ten minutes.  This was wonderful
when I used a dark bock beer, much more flavorful
then when I used a low cost generic beer.  But the
bread is good no matter which brand that you use.
I substituted regular salt for the Sea Salt, with
no ill effects.

Add ingredients in the order specified by your
breadmaker.  Let cool on rack for at least one
hour after it has baked.
