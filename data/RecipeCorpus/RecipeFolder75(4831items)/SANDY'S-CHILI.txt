Title: SANDY'S CHILI
Categories: Main dish, Chili
Yield: 1 Servings
1/3 c  Oil
3 md Onions, chopped
2    Stalks celery, chopped
4    Cloves garlic, minced
1    Bell pepper, chopped
1    Jalapeno pepper, minced
2 lb Tofu chunks
2 tb Each ground red chilis,
-cumin, oregano
1    Bay leaf
2 c  Water
2    28 oz. cans tomatos
6 oz Can tomato paste
2 cn Kidney beans
-salt to taste
Saute first five ingredients in oil until limp.  Add tofu and saute
until browned.  Mix the spices together in a bowl and sprinkle into
the pot. Mix thoroughly. Add water, tomatoes and tomato paste. Stir.
Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours, stirring
occasionally. If desired, at this point, add the kidney beans. Taste
and correct seasoning. The addition of 1 tsp to 1 tblsp of cayenne
pepper can make this gradually more spicy. As the recipe reads, itUs
fairly tame. NOTE: The ground chilis are NOT chili powder.  Most
chili powder is made up of a combination of chilis, oregano, cumin,
salt and garlic. If chili powder is all you can find, then you will
have to readjust the cumin and oregano amounts.
