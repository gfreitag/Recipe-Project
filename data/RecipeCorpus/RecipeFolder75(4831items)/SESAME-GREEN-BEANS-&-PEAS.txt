A delightful combination, with the crunch of browned sesame seeds and
the distinctive flavour of dark sesame oil.

Heat the butter with the oil in a pan. SautÂ‚ the peas and the beans
in the mixture over a moderately high heat, stirring, for 1 minute,
until they are coated. Add sugar and heat through gently for a
further 4-5 minutes, tossing occasionally. Remove the pan from the
heat, stir in the toasted sesame seeds, the sesame oil, and salt and
pepper to taste, and transfer the mixture to a heated serving-dish.
