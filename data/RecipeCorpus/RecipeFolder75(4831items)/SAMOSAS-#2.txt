MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1 md Potato, peeled and diced
1    Carrot, peeled and diced
2 tb Butter
1/2 c  Chopped onion
2    Cloves garlic, minced
1 ts Fresh grated ginger
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Coriander, ground
1/4 ts Cumin
1/4 ts Tumeric

3/4 c  Frozen green peas, thawed
2 tb Water
1 tb Lemon juice
To Make Dough:Sift flour and salt together into a mixing bowl. Add the
melted butter and yogurt and stir with a wooden spoon until the dough
resembles a coarse, crumbly meal. Add cold water by the TBSP-full
until the dough can be gathered into a ball.   Knead on a lightly
floured surface for 5-10 mins, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
Shape into a ball and sit in a loosely covered bowl while you prepare
the filling.

To Prepare Filling:  Cook potatoes and carrot in water until soft.
Drain well, and set aside.  Melt 2 TBS butter in a skillet, and the
onion, garlic, and ginger and saute until soft. Add salt, coriander,
cumin, tumeric,and cayenne, and cook, stirring, until mixture forms a
paste and continue cooking for 2 mins.  Add the drained vegs, and
cook over med high heat, stirring constantly, for 5 mins. Carefully
stir in thawed peas, add water and lemon juice, reduce heat to low,
cover and cook another 5 mins. Remove filling from heat, and cool.

To shape the samosas: Pinch off enough dough to make a ball 1 inch in
diameter.  On lightly floured surface, roll into a 31/2-4" circle.
Cut the circle in half, moisten one of the edges and fold in over on
itself and press to seal, making a cone shape.  Fill the cone with
vegetable mix. Press to seal.  OR...cut into squares, fill, and fold
into triangles.

Heat oil in deep fryer to 370 degrees and fry samosas, removing them
as soon as they are brown and crispy. Drain on paper towelling, and
keep warm in the oven until you have fried them all. *

Filled samosas can be refrigerated in an air-tight container up to 3
hours before frying, but not overnight.

Serve as an appetizer, with mango chutney as a side.

NB.*  I have used a Puff Pastry, or Phyllo dough, and baked them, and
they are just as wonderful.  Less calories too, and less fat.
