Set yogurt in a cheesecloth lined sieve and drain over a bowl in the
refrigerator; while you are cooking and making dinner. This will
thicken the yogurt into a cheese like curd.

Remove all skin and pith and cut orange supremes out of their skin
segments. Season and sweeten with honey and spices to taste.

At least minute fold thickened yogurt into oranges; save some
supremes for garnish and dust with chopped pistachios.
