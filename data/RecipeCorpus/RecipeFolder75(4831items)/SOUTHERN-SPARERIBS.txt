Recipe by: Sylvia Woods Preparation Time: 2:00 1) Season the ribs
with salt and pepper and place them in a 17 by 12 by 12inch
disposable aluminum foil roasting pan. Combine the remaining
ingredients in a bowl and stir until thoroughly blended.  Pour the
marinade over the ribs, making sure the marinade coats all sides of
them. Cover and refrigerate 3 hours to overnight.

the ribs into 2 to 3 rib sections before serving and, if you like,
skim some of the fat from the sauce before passing it around with the
ribs.
