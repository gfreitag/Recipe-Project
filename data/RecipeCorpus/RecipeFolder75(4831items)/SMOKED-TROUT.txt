Title: SMOKED TROUT
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 1 Servings
Trout
Lime, sliced
Lemon, sliced
Smoking wood
* Smoking woods can be as varied as Mesquite, Apple, Alder, Hickory,
or
any other flavor you like. Soak the wood in water at least
overnight. * You will need a covered grill, (Weber is the best.) * If
you use a grill rather than a smoker prepare the charcoal in two
piles on either side of the cooking area. * Light with a
non-petroleum lighter, (electric, parafine based
firestarters, or if you were a Scout, you can try the old two match
method.) After all that the cooking is rather simple. In the cavity
of each trout alternate slices of lemon and lime. Either oil the fish
or the grill with as much oil it will handle. It will make taking the
fish off eaiser. Place the fish in the middle of the charcoal fires.
Put the soaked wood on the charcoal, close the lid (and do not open
for at least 1 hr.), and wait. It will take at least 1 hr to cook and
possible more depending on the number and size of the fish. Check it
after the hour to see if it is flaky. If it is not done, serve some
more appetizers and wait another hour. A good rule of thumb is: 1lb
trout=1 hour, 2 or 2 lb trout=1 1/2 hour, 3 or 3 lb trout=2 hrs.,
etc. Use any leftover in a salad with a spicy dressing. You will be
amazed! Submitted By KEN HAYCOOK <KHAYCOOK@UNICOMP.NET> On THU, 22
