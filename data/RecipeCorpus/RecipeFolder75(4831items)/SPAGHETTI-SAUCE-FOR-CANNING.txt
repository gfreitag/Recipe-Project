Title: SPAGHETTI SAUCE FOR CANNING
Categories: Canning, Italian, Pasta
Yield: 25 Servings
8 qt Plum or paste tomatoes,
Coarse dice -- measure after
Dice
4 tb Oregano -- dry
2 tb Basil -- dry
2 tb Parsely -- dry
1 tb Paprika
1 tb Sugar
1    Head garlic, minced (about 3
To 4 tbsp) -- NOT 1 clove
3 md Onions -- coarse chop
2 md Bell pepper -- coarse chop
2 tb Oil -- olive or other
Dip tomatoes a few at a time in boiling water for 30 seconds, then
place in cool water.  The skins will slip right off.

Chop coarsely and put in enamelware or stainless pot big enough to
hold the 8 quarts of tomatoes and other ingredients. Add spices and
bring to a boil, simmering about 10 minutes. Substitute fresh
herbs/spices if you have them. Adjust for personal taste.

Mince the garlic and coarsely chop the onion and bell pepper; sautee
until just soft in the oil.

Add to the tomato mixture and simmer another 10 minutes or so. Do not
over cook; remember, there will be further cooking during the canning
proccess and when reheating at final use.

Prepare canning jars per manufacturers instructions. It is now
recommended that when canning tomato products additional acid be
added. My canner instructions call for 2 tbsp of bottled (not fresh)
lemon juice per quart of product. Put this in jar before the sauce. I
also add 1 tsp salt per quart. Proccess in pressure canner as
directed.

This recipe produces enough sauce for 7 quarts and enough left over
for one plate of pasta for the cook!
