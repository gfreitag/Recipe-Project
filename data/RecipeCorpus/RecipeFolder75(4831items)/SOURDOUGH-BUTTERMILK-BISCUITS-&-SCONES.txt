Title: SOURDOUGH BUTTERMILK BISCUITS & SCONES
Categories: Pasta
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Sourdough start
1 c  Buttermilk
3 c  1 flour, possible 4 cups
1    Egg
3 tb Oil
1 tb Sugar (ole uses 2 or 3 tb su
-gar)
1 ts Salt
2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Soda (1 1/2 or 2 tsp. if sta
-rt is real sour)
The night before, or three to four hours before you intend to
prepare these, combine sourdough start, buttermilk and 1 cup of the
flour in a large bowl. Cover and let stand at room temperature. When
ready to use, add egg and oil; stir well. Combine sugar, salt, baking
powder and soda; sprinkle over top of batter. Fold in then add as
much of the remaining flour to make a dough you can still stir (2 to
3 cups should do it).
To make Scones, dump batter out on a heavily floured board;
sprinkle flour over top and roll out. Cut out scones. Allow scones to
rise a few minutes then fry on both sides in hot oil until golden
brown.
For Biscuits, add enough flour to make moderately stiff, so you
can knead dough. Knead a few minutes then roll and cut out biscuits.
Drop both sides in oil or melted butter and place on cookie sheet.
Let rise for an hour then bake at 375 degrees for 25 minutes.
