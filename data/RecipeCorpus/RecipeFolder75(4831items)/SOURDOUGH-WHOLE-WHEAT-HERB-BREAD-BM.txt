Sylvia's comments: this came out great except that the dough looked
too dry, so I added a tiny bit more water and it overrose, with a
texture a little too coarse to suit me. Next time I'll just use the
amount of water called for.

If you don't want whole wheat, but prefer a white bread base,
substitute 3-1/2 cups bread or AP flour for the 2 Cups whole wheat
AND the 1-1/2 cups bread or AP flour measurements.
