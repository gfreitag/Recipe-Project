1/2 ts Satay sauce; -=OR=-
2 ts -chili bean sauce
1 ts Sugar
1 ts Dark soy sauce

PLACE THE STEAK IN THE FREEZER for about 20 minutes or until it is
firm to the touch. Cut it, against the grain, into thin slices. Place
the meat in a medium-sized bowl with all the marinade ingredients and
refrigerate for 20 minutes. Separate the Chinese broccoli leaves and
stalks, and cut the leaves into 2-inch pieces. Peel the stalks and
cut them into thin, diagonal slices. Wash well in several changes of
water. Blanch the broccoli for 2 minutes in a large pot of salted,
boiling water. Drain well and arrange on a serving platter. Set aside
in a warm spot. Heat a wok or large skillet until it is very hot and
add the oil. When the oil is very hot, add the meat and stir for 2
minutes. Drain the contents of the wok into a colander set inside a
stainless steel bowl, reserving some of the oil. Return 1 tablespoon
of the drained oil to the wok and reheat. Add the shrimp paste and 3
tablespoons of the chicken stock and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the
remaining stock and the rest of the sauce ingredients and cook for
another 30 seconds. When the sauce has thickened, return the meat to
the wok and stir to mix well. Serve with the warm broccoli.
