Saut^B the bacon in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat for 2
minutes. Add the onions, carrots, shallots, and leek and cook until
well browned, about 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and simmer
over low heat until the liquid has evaporated, about 10 to 15
minutes. Whisk in the flour and cook one minute more. Then add the
garlic, wine, bouquet garni and stock. Simmer over low heat for one
hour.  Stir in the cracked peppercorns and salt then simmer for 10
minutes more. strain through a sieve lined with a layer of
cheesecloth.  Return to the saucepan and add the brandy. Simmer 3
minutes over low heat and serve hot. This easy version of the classic
pepper sauce clearly illustrates why some old-time combinations just
cannot be improved upon.  Serve this with beef or game, especially
pheasant. This sauce will also keep for two days in the refrigerator.
Re-warm over low heat before serving.
