Any number of smoked fish can be used in this simple recipe. Instead
of a large serving bowl, you can also chill it in small individual
bowls or ramekins for an elegant first course, with thinly sliced
French or black bread.

Flake the tuna or mackerel and combine it with the cream cheese,
mayonnaise and lemon juice in a food processor. Process until smooth
and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer the mixture to a
serving bowl and fold in the red onion. Cover and chill the pate
until ready to serve.

MAKES 6 SERVINGS.
