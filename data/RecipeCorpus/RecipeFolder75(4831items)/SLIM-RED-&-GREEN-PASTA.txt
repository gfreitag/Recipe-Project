Place fresh bell peppers in a 10- by 15-inch pan. Broil about 3 inches

minutes. Let cool, then pull off skins, remove stems, and rinse off
seeds. (Drain and seed canned peppers.)

Finely chop peppers in a food processor or with a knife. Place in a
3- to 4-quart pan over medium-high heat with onions, garbanzos,
basil, tarragon, and capers; stir often until steaming, 5 to 7
minutes.

Meanwhile, fill a 5- to 6-quart pan 3/4 full of water; cover and
bring to a boil over high heat.  Add pasta and cook, uncovered, until
barely tender to bite, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain pasta and pour into a
wide, shallow bowl. Spoon pepper mixture onto pasta.  Mix to serve;
season to taste with salt and pepper.
