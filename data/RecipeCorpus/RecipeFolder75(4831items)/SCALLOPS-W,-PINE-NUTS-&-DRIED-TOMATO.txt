Categories: Seafood, Main dish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 tb Vegetable oil
1 1/2 lb Bay scallops (nickel-sized)
-=OR=- large sea scallops,
-(half-dollar sized),
- cut in half
4 tb Pine nuts
1 tb Finely minced shallots
1 ts Finely minced garlic
1/2 c  Dry white wine
2 tb Fresh lemon juice
1/2 c  Dried tomatoes
6 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Finely chopped parsley

Baked potatoes are perfect with these scallops, but don't serve them
with sour cream, which will interfere with the sauce. IF THE DRIED
TOMATOES are packed in oil, drain and pat them dry on a towel. Heat
the oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the oil is almost
smoking, toss in the scallops and cook for 30 seconds without
stirring. Stir with a wooden spoon and let cook another minute. Using
a slotted spoon, remove the scallops to a plate. They should be only
partially cooked. Discard the fat from the skillet. Return the
skillet to high heat, add the shallots, garlic, wine, lemon juice and
dried tomatoes. Boil, reducing wine by half. Meanwhile, the scallops
will have released a certain amount of liquid. Pour this into the pan
and reduce until thick. Return the scallops and add the pine nuts to
the pan, reduce the heat to low, whisk in the butter and add the
chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Pour onto a serving platter.
