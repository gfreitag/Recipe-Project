Title: SHAKE IT & BAKE IT COATING MIX
Categories: Mixes
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Flour
1 ts Pepper
1 ts Paprika
1/2 ts Powdered Thyme
2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Cracker crumbs
1/2 ts Basil or Oregano, crushed
1/2 ts Garlic powder
This mixture is sufficient to coat six pounds of chicken. In a large
jar, shake together the flour, salt, pepper, crumbs, paprika, basil,
thyme and garlic powder until evenly mixed. Place mixture in a
plastic bag. If using only 3 pounds of chicken, place half of the
mixture in a tightly sealed jar and reserved for later use. Moisten
the chicken pieces with milk or water. Place chicken pieces, one at a
time, in the bag and shake until evenly coated. Bake coated chicken
pieces in a greased shallow pan at 350'F. for 45 - 60 minutes. From
