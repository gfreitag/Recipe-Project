Peanut Butter and _____ Sandwiches

Peanut butter combines well with: honey sliced bananas grated carrots

germ cut up dates or any combination of the above

Tuna Fish and Mayonnaise combine with: pickle relish sliced cucumbers
sunflower seeds

Note: Mayonnaise in a sandwich does not hold up well without
refrigeration, and could cause poisoning. It turns rancid upon
prolonged exposure to heat. Avoid using it for summer camp lunches,
or if your child's lunch will be sitting on a radiator in school all
morning. Mayonnaise usually does not freeze well. If the amount you
are using in your sandwich is small, however, you should have no
trouble keeping sandwiches mixed with mayonnaise in the freezer. This
also holds true for egg salad that is well mashed.

Hint: Reduce the fat content of added mayonnaise by combining

Cream Cheese Combines well with: bacon bits crushed pineapple chpped
nuts luncheon meats peanut butter sliced egg sliced cucumber
marmalade or jam raisins, whole or ground

Hint: one enrichment technique is to mix a tablespoon of powdered
milk into an 8-oz bar of cream cheese.
