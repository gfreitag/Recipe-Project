Title: SEKIBAN (RED-COOKED FESTIVAL RICE)
Categories: Side dish, Rice, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  Adzuki beans
1 lb Japanese sweet rice
1 ts Black sesame seeds
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Soy sauce
A day before you plan to serve, place the beans in a colander or
sieve & wash them under cold running water. Then transfer them to a 2
qt pan, cover with 4 cups of cold water & bring to a boil over high
heat. Reduce the heat to its lowest point & simmer the beans
uncovered for 45 minutes, until they are tender but still intact.
Drain the beans through a large sieve or colander set over a large
mixing bowl.  Reserve the liquid & cover the beans with cold water in
another bowl. Cool to room temperature. Stirring with a large spoon,
wash the rice in a large colander under cold running water until the
draining water runs clear. Drain thoroughly & add the rice to the
reserved bean liquid. Soak for 8 hours or overnight, covered, in the
refrigerator. Drain the rice, discard the soaking liquid & combine
the rice and 1 c beans in a bowl. Steam the rice & beans in an
Oriental steamer, or put them in a colander & set the colander in a
large pot filled with 1 1/2" water. Bring the water to a boil over
high heat, cover the pan tightly, & steam for 40 minutes,
replenishing the water in the pot if it boils away. Meanwhile, heat a
small skillet over high heat until a drop of water flicked across its
surface evaporates instantly. Add the sesame seeds &, shaking the pan
gently, cook 2 to 3 minutes, until the seeds are lightly toasted.
Transfer the seeds to a small bowl and toss with 1 ts salt & 1/4 ts
soy sauce. Transfer the steamed rice & beans to a large serving bowl
or individual bowls.  Serve hot or at room temperature as a sweet
course with kuri fukume-ni. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds before
serving.
