1 lg Egg white
2 tb Olive oil
1/4 ts Salt
8    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18"
MMMMM--------------------SMOKED TROUT FILLING-------------------------
2 pk Cream cheese, low-fat (8 oz)
1/2 lb Trout fillets; smoked, skin

1/3 c  Scallions; chopped (2 scall
4 ts Horseradish; well drained
1 c  Cucumber; shredded
To make phyllo tartlet shells: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Lightly coat 2 mini-muffin pans with nonstick cooking spray. In a
small bowl, whisk together egg white, oil and salt.
Lay a sheet of phyllo on a work surface and with a pastry brush,
lightly coat it with the egg-white mixture. Lay a second sheet
smoothly on top, taking care to line up the edges before setting the
sheet down. (Once you set down the sheet, it cannot be moved.) Brush
with the egg-white mixture and repeat with 1 more sheet. Lay a fourth
sheet on top but do not brush it.
With a knife, cut the dough into 4 strips lenghtwise and 5 strips
crosswise, making 24 squares. Press squares into muffin cups and bake
for 8 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Transfer the
tartlets to a rack and let cool. Repeat the procedure with the
remaining 4 sheets of phyllo and egg-white mixture. (The baked
tartlet shells may be stored in a closed container at room
temperature for 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 months.)

To make smoked trout filling: In a food processor, combine cream
cheese and smoked trout; process until fairly smooth. Add scallions
and horseradish and pulse until just combined. (Alternatively, finely
mince the smoked trout with a knife and combine with the cream
cheese, scallion and horseradish in a small bowl.) (The smoked
filling may be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 2 days.) Shortly
before serving, spoon or pipe about 1 heaping tsp. of filling into
each tartlet shell and garnish with shredded cucumber.

tartlet shell." ~-From Eating Well, May/June 1993.
