Drain the tofu, arrabge it in a single layer on a baking sheet or tray
lined with paper towels.  Cover with another baking sheet & weight
with heavy objects. Let stand for 1 or 2 hours.

Combine all the marinade ingredients in a non-reactive bowl & blend
well.

Cut each slab of tofu into 4 rectangles & arrange them in a shallow
non-reactive container.  Pour marinade over the tofu &, cover &
refrigerate for 24 hours. Return to room temperature before grilling.

An hour before cooking, place sesame seeds in a small skillet over
medium heat & toast until fragrant, about
5    minutes.  Cool on a plate.

Prepare an open grill for moderate direct heat. Soak 8 bamboo skewers
for about 20 minutes.

Remove tofu, reserving the marinade.  Beginnig with the root end,
thread the onion pieces lengthwise on skewers alternating with the
tofu. Order the onion pieces to look like a whole onion.

When the grill is ready, lightly brush the rack with oil. Place tofu
on the rack & cook, turning to grill each side & brushing frequently
with the marinade until lightly browned on all sides.

Sprinkle the tofu with reserved sesame seeds & serve immediately.
