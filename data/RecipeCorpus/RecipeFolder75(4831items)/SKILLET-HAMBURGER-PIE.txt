beef, celery, and onion till meat is browned and vegetables
crisp-tender. (Electric skillet 350 degrees). Stir in Worcestershire,

cheese melts. Serves 6.

This recipe was taken from a REALLY old cookbook by Better Homes and
Gardens "Easy Skillet Meals".  I use a little more pepper (prefer
white pepper) and some garlic salt and a little minced garlic if I
have it on hand.  Enjoy!
