2. A good freezer.

3. A food processor or blender.

4. Holder-sticks.  Sometimes these can be purchased in little plastic
bags that hold a few dozen or you might look for candy-apple kits.

Ingredients: 1 Pkg. Knox or other unflavored gelatin. (You might try
flavored gelatins, perhaps pineapple) 1 Can Spam. Water as required.

Dissolve the gelatin as directed and then heat up in a microwave in a
Pyrex measuring cup with perhaps 1/3 cup of water.

Chop the Spam into cubes about 1" on a side and run the food blender,
adding the gelatin water until a good slurry is obtained. Pour/spoon
the slurry into the moulds and freeze for several hours.

To make a chocolate covered Spamsicle, use any of your favorite
tempering chocolates as you ordinarily would.
