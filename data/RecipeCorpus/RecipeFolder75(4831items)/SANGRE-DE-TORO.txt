Title: SANGRE DE TORO
Categories: Beverages
Yield: 1 Drink
1 1/2 oz Tequila
1 1/2 oz 80 proof vodka
6 oz V8 Picante vegetable juice
6    Shakes Tabasco jalapeno
Hot sauce
6    Shakes Tabasco habanero
Hot sauce
1 tb Fresh lime juice
1 pn Ground cumin
1 pn Fresh ground black pepper
Garnish with cilantro sprig
I don't usually call for specific brand names in my recipes but I'm
making an exception in this case. The V8 Picante vegetable juice
cocktail is better than any generic vegetable juice for this drink.

Just mix up the ingredients and pour them over ice. This is just a
variation on the good old bloody mary.
