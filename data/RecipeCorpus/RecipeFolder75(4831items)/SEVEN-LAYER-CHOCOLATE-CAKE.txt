Cake directions:

Beat egg yokes until thick and lemon colored.  Add confectioners'
sugar gradually, beating constantly. Sift flour and salt together and
fold into yolk mixture. Beat egg whites until stiff enough to hold a
peak and fold in lightly.

Line seven-layer cake pans with paper and grease the paper. Divide
batter evenly among pans and bake in moderate oven (350 degrees F.)
for 12 minutes.  Remove from pans at once.

Frosting (filling) directions:

For the frosting, heat chocolate and water in the top of double
boiler. Mix eggs and sugar thoroughly, combine with melted chocolate
and cook until thick, stirring constantly. Remove from heat; add
butter and beat until well blended.  Add vanilla and continue beating
until filling is stiff enough to spread. Cover each layer and top and
sides of cake with filling.

NOTE:  It may be necessary to place several toothpicks through the top
layers to hold them in place until filling sets.

Serve after 24 hours. Serves 14 to 16.
