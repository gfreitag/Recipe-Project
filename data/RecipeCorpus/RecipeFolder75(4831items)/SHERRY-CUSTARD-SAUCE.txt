Title: SHERRY CUSTARD SAUCE
Categories: New, Text, Import
3    egg yolks
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 c  sugar
1 1/4 c  half-and-half
2 TB dry sherry -- (or to taste)
dr lemon juice
:

In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until pale yellow.
In a small saucepan, heat the half-and-half to steaming but do not
boil. Slowly pour the hot cream into the yolk mixture, whisking
constantly to prevent the yolks from scrambling. Pour the mixture
back into the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly
until the sauce thickens slightly. Remove from the heat and strain
immediately into a metal bowl. Add the sherry. Place the bowl into a
larger bowl filled with ice water, or refrigerate. Stir occasionally
to speed the cooling. Store, covered, in the refrigerator up to 3
days.
