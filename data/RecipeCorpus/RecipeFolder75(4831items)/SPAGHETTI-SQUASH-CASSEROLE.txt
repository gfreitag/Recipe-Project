1.Prick the squash in 3 or 4 places with the tines of a fork. Place
it on a microwave-safe plate, cover loosely with microwave-safe
plastic wrap, and cook at full power (650-700 watts) for 9 minutes.
Turn the squash over, and cook another 9 minutes. Then let it stand,
still covered, for 5 minutes. 2. Using a sharp knife, cut a small X
in the bottom of each tomato. Arrange the tomatoes on a
microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Cook at full
power for 4 minutes. 3. Let the tomatoes stand for 1 minute. Then
peel, core and coarsely chop. Pour off the excess liquid. 4. Place 1
T of the olive oil on a small microwave-safe plate and cook at full
power for 2 minutes. Then stir in garlic and cook until it is crisp,
3-4 minutes. 5. Halve the squash and scrape out the seeds. Using a
fork, scoop out the pulp and transfer the spaghetti-like strands to a
2-1/2 quart microwave-safe casserole. Add the tomatoes, garlic and
oil, salt, pepper and remaining 2 T olive oil; toss well. Top with
the mozzarella, parmesan and scallions. 6. Cook at full power until
heated through, 4 minutes. Serve with additional parmesan on the side.
