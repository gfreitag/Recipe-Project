1/2 c  Vegetable oil
1 pk Froz. chopped spinach,thawed
1 ts Dill
1    Clove garlic

8 oz Feta cheese, crumbled

MMMMM------------------------PHYLLO DOUGH-----------------------------
1/2 lb Frozen Phyllo dough
1 c  Butter, melted
PREPARE DOUGH - Thaw according to pkg instructions (may be refrozen).
Cut Phyllo dough into 6"x9" strips; cover w/wax paper with a damp
towel over all.
If dough gets too wet or dry, it will be unworkable - but it's not
difficult once you get used to it. PREPARE FILLING - In oil, saute
spinach, dill garlic & tomato until tender. Add cheeses & pepper. Mix
thoroughly until ingredients are hot; cool slightly. ASSEMBLY - Brush
1 strip of Phyllo dough (it's VERY thin, don't worry if it tears a
little) with melted butter.  Place ts of filling at 1 end. Fold into
small triangles (as if folding a flag).  Continue folding triangle
over & over to end of Phyllo strip.  Brush top w/melted butter.
Repeat for each strip.*** Bake in preheated 350 oven for 15-20 min.
or until tops are lt. brown. ***May be frozen at this point - freeze
1 layer on cookie sheet, store in freezerproof bag--handy to have!!!
I have received many compliments with these! Denise/Syracuse, NY
