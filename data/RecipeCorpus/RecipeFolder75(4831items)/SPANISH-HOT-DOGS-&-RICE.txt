Contributed to the echo by: Marge Clark The recipe has no real
measurments...is a "what you have"... Spanish hot dogs & rice: Enough
rice for four people... put rice on to cook...while it's cooking
slice as many hot dogs as you have (lets say 1/2 pound or more) into
pennies, about 1/2 inch thick. dice 1 green pepper...I used to use
the frozen diced pepper and use a couple of handsful..maybe 3/4 cup?
Diced onion. ditto on the amount. combine all the above, heat, while
the rice is cooking...set the table and spray on some perfume.

This is obviously not a gourmet feast for company. But everyone ATE
it! and there is little that's faster or easier!
