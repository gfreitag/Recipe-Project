1    Spaghetti Squash (3 lb.)
2 c  Broccoli flowerets
1/2 lb Carrots - cut in 1" pieces
1    Zucchini Squash
1/2 c  Scallions - minced

Prepare UNCOOKED TOMATO SAUCE from recipe.  Bake the spaghetti squash
in a preheated, 350 degree oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until it
can be pierced easily with a fork, let it stand for 15 minutes, and
halve lengthwise.  Remove the seeds and scrape the flesh into a large
bowl with a fork. In a large saucepan of boiling salted water boil
the broccoli for 1 minute, transfer to a bowl of ice water with a
slotted spoon and let it cool.  Boil the carrots for 5 to 6 minutes,
transfer to ice water and cool. Boil zucchini for 3 minutes, transfer

halve it lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/4 inch slices. Cook
scallions in the oil over moderate heat in a large skillet, stirring,
until softened. Add the broccoli, carrots, zuchinni, salt and pepper
to taste and heat the mixture, tossing it, for 3 to 4 minutes or
until it is heated through. Add the mixture to the spaghetti squash
with the uncooked tomato sauce, toss and transfer to a serving dish.
Serve the dish warm or at room temperature.
