burn.

sterilized spatula, cover and incubate for 2-6 hours at

approximately 105 degrees. It is done if it separates easily and
cleanly from the jar sides when you tilt the jar gently. It can also
be made in a pressure cooker. Bring milk to a  boil for 30 seconds.
Put the lid and jiggler on the pot and set in a sink of cold water to
cool. Check in about 10-15    minutes. Shake the pot a few times to
evenly distribute the heat of the soymilk. Remove the lid. The
soymilk should be about 110 degrees. Stir in starter with a
sterilized spoon, replace the lid and jiggler and incubate. Put jars
presure cooker in a warm place such as a gas oven with a

pilot light, or a closed insulated picnic cooler box with a drop
