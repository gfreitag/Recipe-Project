and stir around until well coated. Cover and refrigerate 6 yours or
overnight, stirring occasionally.

Position barbecue rack about 5 inches above preheated coals. Thread
lamb cubes onto metal skewers, leaving a small space between cubes so
meat cooks evenly. Thread onion pieces, cherry tomatoes, and pepper
squares onto separate skewers; brush with some remaining marinade.

Arrange lamb skewers over center of coals and cook turning and
basting with marinade occasionally, 17-20 minutes. Halfway through
cooking time, add vegetable skewers to barbecue and cook, turning and
basting with marinade, 8-10 minutes.

Arrange skewers on long serving platter and surround with fresh
sprigs of rosemary.  Serve with rice, salads, or other accompaniments.
