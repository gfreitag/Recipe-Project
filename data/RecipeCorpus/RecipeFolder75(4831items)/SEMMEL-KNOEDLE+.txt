Categories: Carbs, Viennese, Jewish, Heirloom
Yield: 10 Knoedle
8 oz Dryish kaiser rolls
2 tb Margarine or fat of choice
2 ea Eggs (maybe 3)
1 c  Milk
1 sm Onion, chopped
2 tb Dried bread crumbs
1 1/2 c  Flour
Salt and papper to taste
2 tb Fresh herbs, parsley,
-chervil, marjoram,
-(optional, but a great
-improvement)
You will need a frying pan, a small and a large bowl, and a pot of
boiling water or soup to cook the knoedle in.

Dice the bread. Meanwhile mix the egg and the milk in a small bowl
and stir in the bread. Allow to stand for a half an hour or so.

Saute the onion in the fat and add the dry bread crumbs.

Turn the bread, milk, and egg mixture lightly. Add sauteed onion,
flour and seasonings mixing lightly.

Dip your hands in cold water and roll the mixture into about 8 or 10
balls of dough. Have a pot of water coming to a boil if there isn't a
pot of simmering soup waiting. Drop balls of dough into the boiling
salted water or the soup. Poach them for 10 to 15 minutes, until they
are light and firm and well risen.

For firmer dumplings, add more milk and egg

For fluffier dumplings, add more flour.

These go very well with soup or stew but our favorite is with
Hungarian Goulasch.
