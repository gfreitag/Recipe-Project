Title: SELMA'S BEST OATMEAL COOKIES
Categories: Cookies
Yield: 6 Servings
1 c  Shortening
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Brown sugar
1    Egg, beaten
1 1/2 c  Flour
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Cinnamon
1 1/2 c  Quick rolled oats
3/4 c  Finely crushed walnuts or
-pecans
1 ts Vanilla
Cream shortening, sugar and brown sugar together.  Add the egg. In a
separate bowl, sift together the flour, soda and cinnamon. Add it to
the shortening mixture. Then, add the oats, nuts and vanilla. Mix
well.

Chill for an hour.  Shape enough dough to make about the size of a
walnut and place on a greased cookie sheet. Butter the bottom of a
small glass, dip it in sugar and flatten out each dough ball. You
don't need to rebutter the glass bottom, just resugar it each time.
Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.
