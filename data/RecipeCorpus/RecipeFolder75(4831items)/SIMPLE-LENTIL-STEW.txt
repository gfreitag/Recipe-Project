Title: SIMPLE LENTIL STEW
Categories: Vegetables, August
Yield: 1 Servings
1/2 lb Lentils
1    Onion, chopped small
1    Carrot, cut into chunks
1    Potato, cut into chunks
2 tb Margarine
1 tb Flour
Water
Thyme
Salt
Black pepper
Heat up the margarine in a deep saucepan.  Fry the onion, carrot and
potato until soft.  Stir in the flour. Add the lentils and enough
water to generously cover the lentils. Cook the lentils until tender,
adding enough water as needed to keep the stew thick. (The lentils
will grow and absorb water.)  While it is cooking, add thyme, salt,
and pepper to taste. (Thyme should be the dominant spice.) Serve over
rice (I cook S. Indian fluffy rice for this.)
