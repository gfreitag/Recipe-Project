Categories: Chinese, Seafood
Yield: 2 Servings
2    Salmon steaks, 1 1/2" thick
8    Cloud ear black fungus
2 c  Soaked bean thread noodles
1    Sq. pressed beancurd
2    Sprigs Chinese parsley (or

Soak cloud ears and bean starch noodles separately in warm water for
30 minutes, or until soft.  Wash and dice pressed beancurd into 1/4"
cubes.

Heat peanut oil in medium hot wok; add ginger and garlic; remove when
oil becomes fragrant.  Take care not to burn garlic; if you do, start
over. Lightly saute one steak at a time in aromatic oil until surface
is firm.

In clay pot, combine chicken stock, cloud ears, sherry, salt and
pepper. Bring to boil; add bean thread noodles; return to boil. Now,
reduce liquid to gentle simmer; add salmon steaks carefully so they
remain whole; add diced bean curd.  Cover and simmer for 5-7 minutes,
until steaks are cooked.

Uncover, swirl in red vinegar and sesame oil.  Garnish with parsley.
