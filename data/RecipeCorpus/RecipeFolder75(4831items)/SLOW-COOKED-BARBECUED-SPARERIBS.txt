Title: SLOW COOKED BARBECUED SPARERIBS
Categories: Pork, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 4 Servings
3/4 c  Ketchup
1/2 c  Cider vinegar
2 tb Hot sauce
1 md Onion, grated
3    Garlic cloves, minced
1 tb Worcestershire sauce
1    Rack of pork ribs, about 4
-pounds
This is a pretty typical US
-BBQ treatment.
Combine the ketchup, vinegar, hot sauce, onion, garlic and
Worcestershire sauce in a mixing bowl and stir until blended. Pour
half of the sauce into a glass baking dish large enough to hold the
ribs in a single layer. Place the ribs meaty side down in the sauce.
Pour remaining sauce over; cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.

Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are thickly coated with ash. If
you are using a gas grill, preheat on low for 5 minutes with the lid
closed.

Place the ribs on a rack set at least 6 inches from the fire. Grill
slowly, for 15 minutes.  Turn and baste with sauce. Ribs should have
browned slightly. If they still look raw, stoke the fire. If they
have browned a great deal or scorched in spots, move ribs to a cooler
part of the fire. Cook for 15 minutes, baste, and turn again. Grill
for 30 to 45 minutes longer, turning and basting, every 5 minutes.
Watch the fire carefully, keeping flames away from the ribs.

To serve, slice the rack into individual ribs and pile on a heated
platter.

Serves 4.
