Title: SCALLOPED CORN 2
Categories: Corn, Vegetables
Yield: 1 Servings
2 cn Regular corn
2 cn Creamed corn
1 cn Evaporated milk (Carnation)
1    Egg
1 pk Saltine crackers (wrapped
-stack)
1/4 c  Chopped onions
In a large bowl, mix all the above together except the milk. After
mixing add enough milk to moisten well but not to be soupy. Add salt
and pepper to taste.

Place in baking bowl or dish (pyrex, etc.) and top with specks of
butter or margarine. Cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for 45
minutes. Uncover and continue baking for additional 20-30 minutes to
brown top.

If recipe is doubled and baked in a larger dish add another 15
minutes to baking time.

The secret is to keep the corn moist while in the oven.
