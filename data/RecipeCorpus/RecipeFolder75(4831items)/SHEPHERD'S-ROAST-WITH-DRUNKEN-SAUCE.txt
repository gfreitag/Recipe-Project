(Shepherd's Roast with Drunken Sauce]

In Hidalgo, halves of mutton are hung over a wood fire and slowly
turned until the meat is cooked and the outside is crisp and black.

Toward the end of the cooking process, the roast is basted with
lightly salted butter.  It's served with Salsa Borracha, below.

FOR THE ROAST:

Use a 5-pound leg of lamb and roast it on a spit over a charcoal fire
until done the way you like it (1 1/2 to 2 hours). Baste from time to
time with lightly salted butter in which a clove of garlic has been
crushed and a pinch of dry mustard added.

In an ungreased skillet, cook the dried chili pasillas for a few
minutes, turning occasionally to prevent burning. Skip this step if
chili powder is used. Remove stems and seeds and cover them with the
water, saving the skins.  In about 3/4 hour, put the chilies in a
blender with the remaining ingredients and 4 tablespoons of the water
in which the chili seeds were soaked.  Blend all until smooth. Strain
the remaining chile water and add to sauce.  Serve, either by pouring
a little over each portion of meat, or letting guests help
themselves. Add more chili powder or chilies for a hotter sauce.

Makes 6 servings.
