Italian Hot Sausage can be used but is not recommended. Only if
*
the Chorizo is not available. ** Tomato should be peeled, seeded and
chopped.

Crumble the sausage into an unheated 10-inch skillet. Slowly cook the
sausage for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain off the
excess fat.  In a medium bowl beat the eggs, milk, salt and pepper,
with a fork. Pour the egg mixture over the sausage in the skillet.
Cook with out stirring over low heat until the eggs start to set on
the bottom and sides of the skillet. Lift the cooked portion of the
eggs so that the uncooked can run under the cooked portion. Continue
to lift and fold for 2 to 3 minutes until the eggs just begin to
fully set. Stir in the tomato and continue to cook as above until the
eggs are cooked through but are still glossy and moist.  Serve hot.
