Prepare the polenta as usual, finishing with a generous sprinkle of
grated Parmesan while still hot. Let the polenta cool. Cut each slice
in half diagonally, forming triangles. Blanch the sweet Italian
sausages and slice thinly. Combine the sausage, bell pepper slices
and minced garlic with the Marinara sauce. Heat through. Spoon the
sauce over the polenta. Top with a very generous grating of
Provolone. Heat the dish under the broiler just until the cheese melts
