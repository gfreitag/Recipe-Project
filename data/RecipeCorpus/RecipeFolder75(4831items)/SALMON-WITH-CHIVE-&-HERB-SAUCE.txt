Title: SALMON WITH CHIVE & HERB SAUCE
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 Servings
1 c  Chicken broth
2 ts Tarragon, fresh; minced
2 ts Thyme, fresh; minced
4    Salmon steak; 1" thick, 6 oz
1    Garlic clove; minced or
-pressed
1 ts Cornstarch

In a 10-12 inch frying pan over high heat, bring broth, tarragon, and
thyme to a boil.  Lay salmon in pan and reduce heat to simmering;
cover pan. Cook until fish is opaque but still moist-looking in
thickest part (cut to test), about 10-15 minutes. LIft steaks onto a
platter; cover and keep warm.

Add garlic to pan; boil on high heat, uncovered, until liquid is
reduced to 1/2 cup, 3-4 minutes.  Mix the cornstarch with 2 Tbsp of
water and stir into pan; stir until boiling. Mix in chives and pour
sauce over the salmon. Season servings individually with salt, pepper
and juice from the lemon wedges.
