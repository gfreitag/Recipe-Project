1 c  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,

:
1 1/4 c  chicken broth -- or water
3 1/2 c  milk -- lukewarm
6 oz Monterey Jack cheese --
grated
:
1/2 ts salt -- or to taste
1/4 ts pepper -- or to taste

Over medium to medium-low heat, melt the butter and saute, the onion,
potatoes, green onions, and chiles until they are soft but not brown,
about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and saute, over medium to
medium-high heat for 3 minutes. Next, add the chicken broth or water
and bring the soup to a boil; then turn down the heat and simmer
covered, for 15 minutes.

Remove the cover and add the milk and cheese. Stir the soup
constantly and heat, without allowing to boil, until the cheese is
melted and incorporated with the soup. Overheating the soup will
cause it to curdle. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with
hot flour tortillas and butter. Serves 4. Typos by Brenda Adams
