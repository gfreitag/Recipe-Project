Title: SMOKED FISH

SEE DIRECTIONS:
Along the East coast where I live there's always an abundant supply of
fresh fish. In the Spring there's fresh mackerel, and the Bluefish in
the Fall, are my favorites for smoking.

This recipe will work with Mackerel, Bluefish, Salmon, and even Cod.

If you catch the fish yourself, cut through their throat to bleed them
while they're still alive. Put them head down in a bucket so they'll
pump out as much blood as possible. Wash and chill the whole fish
until you can fillet them.

Early in the morning of the day you're going to smoke wash 4 to 6
fillets and place them in a brine made from: 1 quart cold water
1/3    cup Kosher salt
1/4    cup sugar 1 teaspoon black, red or other peppers (spices)
to taste

Mix this together in a glass or enamel bowl add the fish and submerge
the fillets with a weight to hold them under the brine. Brine the
fillets in the refrigerator from 2 to 4 hours (longer makes the fish
saltier).

Remove the fillets and wipe dry with paper towels. Place them, skin
side down, on several thicknesses of dry paper towels and let them
air dry for several hours. The surface is dry enough when your finger
sticks to the flesh.

Hot smoke over a 250 degree wood fire for about 2 hours or until the
fillets are firm to the touch (like medium rare steak).

Peel off the skin and enjoy.
