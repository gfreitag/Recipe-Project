Categories: Soups, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
6 x  Slices bacon
4 tb Unsalted butter (1/2 stick)
6 c  Peeled, cut up pumpkin

The bacon should be diced and cooked crisp.  Reserve the fat. The
pumpkin should be cut in 1-inch pieces. Heat the bacon fat and butter
in a stock pot over medium-high heat. Add the pumpkin and saute for
15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour in the stock and simmer
covered until the pumpkin is very tender, about 30 minutes. Remove
from heat. Add the Marsala, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste.
Process the soup in batches in a blender until smooth.  Return to the
stock pot. Add the bacon. Simmer 10 minutes.  Serve immediately,
garnish with toasted pumpkin seeds.
