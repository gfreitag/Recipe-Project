Title: SAUTEED SALMON SCALLOPS WITH GREENS
Categories: Seafood, Appetizers
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Spinach, fresh
1 1/2 lb Salmon fillets; skinless
Salt
Pepper
3 tb Olive oil
1 lg Onion, yellow; finely chopt
2    Garlic clove; pressed
3 tb Lemon juice
3 tb Parsley, fresh; minced
Wash greens thoroughly and remove tough stems; cut leaves into thin
strips and set aside.  Rinse salmon and pat dry. Hold knife at an
angle and slice salmon into 4 or 8 equal pieces. Place each piece of
fish between 2 pieces of waxed paper, the cut sides against paper,
and pound gently with a mallet or rolling pin to create slices of
even thickness (about 1/8 inch thick). Season scallops of salmon with
salt and pepper if desired. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a
5- to 6-quart pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and stir until
tender but not brown, about 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and greens;
cook, stirring, until the greens are just tender, about 3 minutes.
Transfer greens to a bowl and keep warm. Heat about 1 teaspoon of the
remaining oil in the pan, or in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan, over
medium-high heat. Add scallops to pan in a single layer (you will
cook salmon in several batches) and cook until edges turn opaque, 20
to 30 seconds.  Turn scallops and cook other side about 15 seconds.
Lift cooked salmon from pan and keep warm. Repeat with remaining
scallops, adding additional oil if necessary to prevent sticking.
When scallops are cooked, add the lemon juice to the pan and scrape
the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen browned bits.
Stir in the parsley and set aside. To serve, divide greens among
warmed plates, top with 1 or 2 of the salmon scallops, pour the pan
sauce over each serving.
