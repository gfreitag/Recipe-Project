1/3 c  Lemon juice or white wine
1    Garlic clove; peeled

2 tb Fresh basil; chopped

"With the sauce prepared in advance, this colorful dish makes a quick
entree for two, good served over fluffy rice."

Marinate prepared shrimp several hours in lemon juice or white wine,
with half the garlic and half the basil.

Meanwhile, cut leeks lengthwise and wash well under running cold
water, then chop.

Heat 1 tb. butter and 1 tb. oil in large skillet until hot. Add leeks
and saute 5 minutes, or until soft. Add remaining garlic and the
tomatoes; cook over medium heat 6 to 8 minutes. Add remaining basil
and salt and pepper to taste.  Cook until thick.  Mixture can be
refrigerated at this point, overnight, if desired.

Several minutes before serving, reheat leek-tomato mixture over
medium-high heat in skillet.

In separate pan, heat remaining butter and oil until sizzling. Add
shrimp and cook on first side 40 seconds, or until they turn pink.
Turn and cook on remaining side 40 seconds more. Pour heated
leek-tomato mixture over top of shrimp and cook, stirring, 1 minute.

Serve at once over rice pilaf, if desired, garnished with whole basil
sprigs.

Yield:  Serves 2 as an entree, or 3 as an appetizer.
