Title: SALT BAKED CHICKEN
Categories: Chinese, Poultry
Yield: 4 Servings
3 lb Fryer
6 lb Rock salt
Parchment paper
1/4 c  Peanut oil
1 ts Salt
3 tb Dark soy sauce
1    Whole star anise
2 tb Sherry
1 tb Fresh ginger, minced
1 tb Garlic, minced
2    Green onions, chopped
Preparation:  Wash chicken & pat dry.  Swab cavity with sherry; stuff
with ginger, garlic & green onions; seal with clip or string. Rub
outside of chicken with dark soy sauce; allow to stand until soy
sauce is absorbed. Wrap chicken in 3 layers of parchment paper, tie
with string, coat outer layer with peanut oil.

Baking:  In wok or large pot, heat rock salt, stirring periodically,
until it begins to brown.  Place wrapped chicken in rock salt,
spooning some salt around sides & over top. Cook for about 10
minutes. Turn over chicken, cover with rock salt (but always have at
least 2" layer of salt under chicken) & cook for another 10 minutes.
This cooking time will give a moist, slightly underdone chicken.
Increase baking time to 15 minutes on each side, for well done.

Remove chicken from salt; strip off paper; allow to stand for 15
minutes to cool & congeal juices.  Cut in half, then into bite-size
pieces. Serve with soy dip.
