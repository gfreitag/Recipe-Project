Title: SCALLOPS ST.JACQUES~ A LA PROVENCAL
Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg 2
Yield: 4 Servings
6 tb Butter
1/4 c  Finely chopped yellow onion
2 tb Finely chopped green onion
2 ts Finely chopped garlic
1 c  Flour
Salt and pepper
1 1/2 lb Scallops, cut into 1/4-inch
-slices
2/3 c  Dry white wine
1/4 ts Thyme
1    Bay leaf
1/3 c  Grated Swiss cheese
"...For those who love a harmony of softly blended flavors with the
faint suggestion of seafood..."

Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a skill over medium heat. Add the
onions, green onions and garlic. Cook, stirring often, for about 5
minutes, or until the onions are tender but not browned. Using a
slotted spoon, remove the onions and garlic and set aside.

Put the flour, salt and pepper on a large piece of waxed paper, and
stir with a fork to mix well.

Dip the scallop slices into the flour mixture and coat well. Shake off
excess flour.

Melt 2 tablespoons of the remaining butter in the skillet and quickly
saute the scallops in it until they are lightly browned. Lower the
heat and add the wine, thyme, bay leaf and onion mixture. Cover and
simmer for 5 minutes.

Remove the scallops with a slotted spoon and spread them in a layer
in a shallow baking dish.  (I use a 10-inch pie plate, but you may
use 4 large scallop shells, if you prefer).

Briskly boil the scallop cooking liquid for about 1 minute to reduce
and thicken it.  Pour the sauce over the scallops. (This may be made
early in the day and covered and refrigerated until just before
serving.) About 3 minutes before serving, sprinkle the cheese over
the scallops, dot with remaining butter, and run under the broiler
just long enough to melt the cheese and lightly brown it. Serve hot.

Serves 4.
