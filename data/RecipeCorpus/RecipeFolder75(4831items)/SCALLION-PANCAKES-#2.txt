Title: SCALLION PANCAKES #2
Categories: Chinese, Pancakes
Yield: 6 Servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1 c  Boiling water
Peanut Oil
1/2 c  Chopped whole scallions
Place flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Gradually pour in boiling
water, stirring with a wooden spoon to mix. When cool enough to
handle, knead with your hands about 10 minutes until the dough is
elastic. Place dough in a bowl and cover with a damp dish towel for
30 minutes.

Roll the dough out to a rectangular shape approximately 1/4 x 10 x 15
inches.  Brush the top lightly with peanut oil. Sprinkle scallions
over the entire surface of the dough.  Starting from one end, roll up
the dough as you would a carpet.  Cut the roll into 6 thick slices.
Flatten each slice slightly with your hand. Roll out each piece,
turning it to keep it circular, until it is 1/4 inch thick and about
6 inches in diameter. Keep the finished pancakes covered with a damp
towel while you are working.

Heat skillet over high heat and pour in oil t 1/4 inch deep. When oil
is hot, turn heat to medium low.  Cook pancakes one at a time, about
30 seconds on each side, until they are golden in color. Cut into
wedges and serve warm.

Pancakes may be reheated in the oven before serving.
