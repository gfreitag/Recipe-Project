Title: SAFFRON BUNS
Categories: Bread
Yield: 16 Servings
1/4 c  Water -- hot
1/4 ts Saffron threads -- crushed
1/2 c  1% milk -- *NOTE
1/4 c  Sugar -- **NOTE
2 tb Margarine, imitation --
***NOTE
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 lg Egg
1 tb Yeast -- +2 teaspoon
3 c  All-Purpose Flour --
Unbleached
King Arthur -- to 3 1/4
Cups
TOPPING:
1 lg Egg white -- beaten lightly
1 ts Water
Pearl sugar
Combine the hot water and saffron, and let sit for 10 minutes to
soften the saffron. In a mixing bowl, beat together the saffron
water, milk, sugar, butter, salt, egg, yeast, 2 cups of the flour.
Add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead the
dough (for about 15 minutes by hand, 12 minutes in an electric mixer,
90 seconds in a food processor, or in your bread machine using the
dough cycle), then set it aside to rise till puffy (but not
necessarily doubled in bulk), about 2 hours. Punch the dough down,
and let it rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Divide the dough into 16
pieces, and shape each piece into a ball. Place the balls fairly
close together (but not touching) in a 12-inch deep -dish pizza pan
or 9 x 13-inch pan, cover them, and let rise for 1 1/2 hours, or
until they're puffy. Glaze the buns with the mixture of beaten egg
white and water, then sprinkle them heavily with pearl sugar. Bake
them in a preheated 375 degrees F oven for 20 minutes, or until
they're golden brown. ( watch them closely at the end; because of
their high sugar content, they tend to brown quickly.) Serve with
butter or Devon cream. Yield: 16 buns.
