Categories: Pork, Italian, Meats
Yield: 12 Servings
2 lb Fat-trimmed pork (or veal)
-shoulder, ground
1/2 c  Chianti wine

1 ts Fennel seeds
1/4 ts Each: black pepper and red

Note:  It's not necessary to stuff meat mixtures into sausage
casings. In fact, if you plan to barbecue, it's better to shape the
meat into flat hamburger-like sausage patties that fit in pita
pockets or on thin rounds of French or Italian Bread. To Make
Patties: Combine all ingredients and mix lightly. Shape into patties,
six per pound of meat. Raw patties may be frozen for later use;
Arrange them in a single layer on a cookie tin lined with aluminum
foil. Cover with foil, label and freeze. Patties may be barbecued or
broiled without defrosting. To Cook: Place patties 3 inches from heat
source and broil or barbecue for about two to three minutes per side
(three to four minutes each side if frozen); be sure meat is cooked
through.  Makes 12 patties, 130 calories each with pork; 100 calories
each with veal.
