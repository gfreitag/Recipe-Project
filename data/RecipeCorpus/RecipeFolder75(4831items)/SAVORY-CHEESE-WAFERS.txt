Beat the first five ingredients with an electric mixer until well
combined. Mix in the pecans. Divide the dough into thirds. Form each

slices. Arrange 1-1/2" apart on baking sheets. Bake until golden
brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer to paper towels and cool
completely. Store in an airtight container.
