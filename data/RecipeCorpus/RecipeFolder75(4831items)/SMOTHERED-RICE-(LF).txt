Title: SMOTHERED RICE (LF)
Categories: Basic, Healthwise, Persian, Rice
3 c  basmati rice -- long grain
Yield: 6 Servings
2 ts salt
5 1/2 c  water
2 TB olive oil

This is the simplest way of cooking Persian rice. 1. Pick over and
wash 3 cups of rice 5 times in warm water.

2. Place rice, salt, and water in a deep non-stick pot. Bring to a
boil over high heat, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes
over medium heat (do not cover the rice). Gently stir the rice with a
wooden spoon a few times while it boils.

3. When the rice has absorbed all the water, pour the oil over it and
stir through gently with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat.

4. Place a clean dish towel or 2 layers of paper towel over the pot
and cover firmly with the lid on to prevent steam from escaping. Cook
40 minutes over low bleat. Remove the potfrom heat and allow to cool
for 5 minutes on a damp surface without uncovering.

5. Gently taking one skimmer or spatula full of rice at a time,
without disturbing the bottom crust, place the rice on a serving
platter. Mound rice in shape of a cone.

6. Detach the crust from the bottom of the pot using a wooden spatula.
Place on a small platter and serve.
