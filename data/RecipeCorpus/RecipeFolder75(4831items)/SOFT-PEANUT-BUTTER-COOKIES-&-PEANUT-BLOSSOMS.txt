Title: SOFT PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES & PEANUT BLOSSOMS
Categories: Biscuits
Yield: 1 Servings
14 oz Can sweetened condensed milk
3/4 c  Peanut butter
2 c  Biscuit baking mix
1 ts Vanilla extract
Granulated sugar
Preheat oven to 375.  In large mixer bowl, beat sweetened condensed
milk and peanut butter until smooth. Add biscuit mix and vanilla; mix
well. Shape in to 1-inch balls. Roll in sugar. Place 2 inches apart
on ungreased baking sheet.  Flatten with fork. Bake 6 to 8 minutes or
until LIGHTLY browned (do not overbake). Cool. Store tightly covered
at room temperature. Makes about 5 dozen.

I make the variation they call Peanut Blossoms.

Shape as above; DO NOT FLATTEN.  Bake as above.  Press milk chocolate
candy kiss (unwrapped) in center of each ball IMMEDIATELY after
baking.

Be sure to have the kisses unwrapped by the time the cookies are done
baking. Press the kiss well in to the cookie so it stays better. The
cookie will spread out as you press, leaving cracks and gaps along
the outside edge.
