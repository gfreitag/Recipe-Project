I would add one restaurant to David's list. Unfortunately, in
replying to his original posting I couldn't remember its name, but my
wife did later. It's name is "Healthy David's," and it's located just
a few blocks from the Plaza in a building with a number of boutiques.
They have an extensive menu of natural juices and smoothies, and a
variety of vegan entrees, most of which, if I recall correctly, were
vlf or could be prepared that way. Unprepossessing surroundings, more
reminiscent of a fast food lunch joint than a fine restaurant, but
closer to this list's criteria than even the Natural Cafe.
