Title: SALSA GUASACACA (SPICY AVOCADO SAUCE)
Categories: Other sauce
Yield: 2 Servings
1 sm Ripe tomato
1 lg Ripe avocado
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/2 ts Red chili paste -- or very
Finely chopped, seeded
Fresh hot chili
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper -- freshly
Ground
2 tb Green pepper -- finely
Diced
1    Cold hard (boiled ?) cooked
Egg -- finely chopped
1 tb Fresh parsley -- finely
Chopped
1 ts Fresh coriander; (cilantro)
Finely chopped
Cut out the stem of the tomato, then slice the tomato in half
crosswise. Squeeze each half gently to extract the seeds and juices
discard them, and chop the tomato into 1/4 inch dice. Cut the avocado
in half. With the tip of a small knife, loosen the seed and lift it
out. Remove any brown tissuelike fibers clinging to the flesh. Strip
off the skin with your fingers, starting at the stem end (the dark
skinned variety does not peel easily; use as small, sharp knife to
pull the skin away, if necessary). Chop the avocado into small dice.
In a large mixing bowl combine the oil, vinegar, chili paste (or
fresh chili), salt and black pepper, and, with a large wooden spoon,
mix well. Add the diced tomato, avocado, green pepper, chopped egg,
parsley and coriander, and mix together gently but thoroughly. Taste
for seasoning. Guasacaca is traditionally served with grilled meats.
