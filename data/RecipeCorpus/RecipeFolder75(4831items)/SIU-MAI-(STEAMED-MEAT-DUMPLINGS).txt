1    Green onion stalk;chop fine
1 pk Wonton skins or
-1 recipe egg noodle dough*
*Recipe is included in this collection. PREPARATION: Mix all
ingredients except wonton skins. WRAPPING: Trim off 4 corners of
wonton skins to form circles.
Drop 1 tsp. mixture onto middle of the skin, gather up skin sides,
letting the dough pleat naturally. Flatten top and give the middle a
light squeeze while tapping the bottom on a flat surface so it will
stand upright.
STEAMING: Arrange dumplings in an 8 inch round cake pan. Set pan on
the steam rack in the wok. Fill bottom of wok with water. Cover.
Steam for 15-20 minutes.
Serve hot with a sesame oil and soy sauce dip. (1 part sesame oil to
2 parts light soy sauce.) DO AHEAD NOTES: Steam dumplings. Cool and
freeze. Reheat by steaming again for 12-15 minutes. COMMENTS: Insert
toothpicks for easy serving. If you use a bamboo or aluminum steamer,
place dumplings directly on the rack without the cake pan. Steam for
the same amount of time. Since steamed dumplings can be made ahead
and reheated in great quantities they make marvelous hors d'oeuvres
for large cocktail parties. The two-tier aluminum steamer works
particularly well. Source: "Dim Sum" by Rhoda Fong Yee. Formatted for
