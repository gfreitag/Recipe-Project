Note: The name in the family recipe book is "Seven Layer Salad."
Don't ask me why?  It really isn't seven layers, but it has become my
favorite. (BC)

Using a fairly deep baking dish (I use a 4" deep 9" X 9" pyrex pan),
place a bed of chopped lettuce on the bottom, then lay down a layer
of celery, then onion, then green peppersm then peas, then eggs. The
order is really not that important, and they will nor really
constitute a solid "layer."

Then and another layer of lettuce and repeat the procedure.

Mix mayonaise and sugar together and spread on top.

Sprinkle bacon and cheddar cheese on top of the whole thing.

Cover tightly and leave overnight in refrigerator, allowing mayonaise
to permeate the whole thing. From Bumgarner Family Recipes submitted
