In a large, wide Dutch oven or large, deep skillet, saute the butter,
chopped onion, celery, and carrot until they are soft but not
browned. Add the ground meats and prosciutto, turning the flame very
low. It is very important that the meat heat very gently, only enough
to color it on the outside. Not searing the meat allows it to absorb
the other flavors of the sauce, and will also make it more delicate
and creamy. Break up and stir the meat as you heat it. You should get
it to a uniform pink, not brown color. Add the salt, pepper and wine.
Simmer very gently for several minutes until the alcohol evaporates
and the liquid begins to be absorbed by the meat and vegetables. Stir
in milk and nutmeg. It is important to add the milk before adding the
tomatoes for it to be absorbed directly by the meat. Cook gently for
10 minutes. Add the tomatoes. When the sauce begins to simmer, turn
the flame down as low as you can. If your burner cannot be regulated
low enough, insert a "flame tamer." Simmer in this way, partially
covered, for about 4 hours, stirring it gently now and then. Check
for seasonings and add an additional pinch of nutmeg if necessary. If
the sauce is being used on fresh noodles (not lasagne), and you have
a mind to be extravagant, add the cream and the finely sliced truffle
when it is finished. Stir and pour over cooked fresh pasta.

Yield: Sauce for 1 pound of pasta
