1/2 lb Bacon
4    Eggs-beaten
1/2 c  White wine
3 tb Unsalted butter
Pepper to taste
12 oz Thin spaghetti
1/2 c  Grated Italian cheese
Cook bacon until lightly crisp. Drain and reserve 2 tbls drippings.
Coarsly chop bacon and leave on the side. Melt butter in bacon
drippings, add wine and pepper and simmer 5 min. Cook spaghetti
according to directions. Add bacon to butter-wine mixture. The next
step must be done quickly so the eggs will cook from the heat of the
pasta. Drain pasta, well. Toss pasta with bacon sauce and beaten
eggs. Mix with 1/2 the grated cheese and serve with extra cheese on
the side for topping. For those looking to keep the fats down a bit,
Eggbeaters can be substituted for the eggs.)
