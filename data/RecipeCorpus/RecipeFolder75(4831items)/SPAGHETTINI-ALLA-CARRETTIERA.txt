1 lb Fresh tomatoes, cut up
3 cl Garlic

3/4 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Vodka
10    Sprigs Italian parsley,
Coarsely chopped
1 lb Spaghettini
Combine the chile, tomatoes, garlic and olive oil. Simmer the sauce
for 30 minutes and run through a food mill to remove seeds and skins.

Add the cream and vodka and simmer until the sauce is reduced.
