Title: SMOKED FISH SALAD WITH DILL VINAIGRETTE
Categories: Salads, Appetizers, Seasonings
Yield: 6 Servings
6 oz Smoked fish
12 sl Baguette
1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
2 tb White wine vinegar
1    Shallot; finely diced
1/4 c  Chopped dill
1 1/2 ts Nonpareil capers
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 qt Mixed small lettuces
-- cleaned and dried
Pickled onions (optional)
This composed salad-appetizer can be made with any kind of smoked
fish. I like to include two types - salmon for its color and flavor
and any kind that I have smoked or that is fresh-smoked from the
market.

Slice the fish very thin.  Toast the baguette slices until they are
golden and crunchy and brush them lightly with olive oil while they
are warm.

Whisk the remaining olive oil into the vinegar in a small bowl. Add
the shallot, dill, capers, and season with salt and pepper.

Arrange the fish slices on the toasted baguette croutons. Top each
portion with about 1/2 teaspoon of the vinaigrette.

Toss the remaining vinaigrette with the lettuces and arrange the
leaves on a platter.  Arrange the croutons on the lettuce leaves and
serve immediately, accompanied by pickled onions if desired.
