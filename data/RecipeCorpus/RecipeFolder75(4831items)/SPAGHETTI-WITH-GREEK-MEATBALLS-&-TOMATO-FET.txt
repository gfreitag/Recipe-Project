are just firm to the touch, and transfer them with a slotted spoon to
a plate.

Make the sauce:

In the kettle cook the onion in the oil over moderately low heat,
stirring occasionally and scraping up the brown bits, until it is
softened. Add the tomatoes, chopping them with a spoon, and stir in
the wine, carrot, garlic, salt and pepper to taste. Bring the liquid
to a boil and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 15
minutes. Add the meatballs and any juices that have accumulated on
the plate and simmer the mixture for 5 minutes. Stir in the mint and
the Feta and keep the sauce hot over moderately low heat, stirring
occasionally.

In a kettle of boiling salted water cook the spaghetti for 8 to 10
minutes, or until it is al dente, and drain it well. Transfer the
spaghetti to a heated platter and spoon the sauce over it.
