Title: SOUR DOUGH STARTER #7
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 c  Milk
1 c  Flour
To Begin, place one cup milk in a glass jar or crock (nothing metal)
and allow to stand at room temperature for 24 hours.
Stir in 1 cup flour. (To speed the process, cover with cheese cloth
and place out doors for several hours to expose dough to the wild
yeast cells floating in the wind.)
Leave uncovered in a warm place (80 is ideal) for 2 to 5 days,
depending on how long it takes to bubble and sour. (May be kept near
pilot light on gas range.) If it starts to dry out, stir enough
moderately warm water to bring back to the original consistancy. ONce
it has a good sour aroma and is full of bubbles, it is ready to use.
As you use replace with equal parts milk and flour.
