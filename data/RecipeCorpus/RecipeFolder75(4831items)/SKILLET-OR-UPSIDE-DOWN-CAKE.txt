Title: SKILLET OR UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4    To 1/2 cup butter
Add, cook gently, and stir
-until dissolved:
1/2    To 1 cup packed brown sugar
Remove from the pan and add:
(1 cup pecan meats) *
-optional, I omitted this *
Place over the butter and
-sugar mixture:
Slices or halves of canned
-drained fruit: no. 2 1/2
-can
* I put half marachino
-cherries, curved side down,
-in the
Spaces *
Cover the fruit with the
-following batter.  Sift
-together:
1 c  Cake flour
1 ts Double-acting baking powder
Beat in a separate bowl:
4    Egg yolks
Add:
1 tb Melted butter * I used oil *
1 ts Vanilla
Sift in separate bowl:
1 c  Sugar
Whip until stiff, but not
-dry:
4    Egg whites
A Heavy 9 or 10 inch skillet * I used a 9 inch cake pan and melted the
butter in the oven *

Vary this recipe, which conventionally calls for canned pineapple, by
using canned or frozen raspberries, peaches, or apricots. The last
two require only 1/2 cup of sugar. Fresh fruit - peaches, cherries,
apples, etc. - may require more than 1 cup, depending on the acidity
of the fruit.

Preheat the oven to 350. Melt in a skillet: Fold in the sugar, 1
tablespoon at a time; then fold in the yolk mixture, and finally the
sifted flour, 1/4 cup at a time. Bake the cake about 30 minutes.
Immediately upon removal from the oven, reverse the cake on a serving
plate. Allow the cake to remain over the cake to let the brown sugar
mixture coat the cake. Remove the pan and serve upside down, after
sprinkling the fruit with: (Brandy or rum) * I didn't do this, but
yum yum yum! * The cake may be garnished with: (Whipped cream or a
dessert sauce) *Good Heavens, why? * For individual servings, try
this method:  Put butter, sugar and fruit in base of custard cups,
run batter given above on
