dish with 2 of the kiwi slices. KIWI CHARDONNAY SAUCE: Place the
kiwis in a blender and puree them. In a small saucepan place the
pureed kiwi, shallots, and Chardonnay. Heat the ingredients on high

constantly, add the butter cubes one at a time. Add the salt and stir
it in.  Remove the sauce from the heat and keep it warm until you are
ready to serve it.
