Categories: Chili, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
2 tb Whole cumin
2 md Onion, diced
3    Garlic cloves
Vegetable oil
3 1/2 lb Lean beef, cut in 1/2"cubes
2 tb Paprika
6 tb Chili powder
Water
Salt to taste
Cracker meal *OR*
Browned flour for tightener
In a skillet, slightly toast the whole cumin. To wake up the flavors
crush them with a rolling pin. Powdered cumin may be substituted, but
do not toast. Saute onion and garlic in a little oil until
transparent. In same skillet, add a little more oil and sear meat
until it has a greyish color. Put cumin, onion, garlic and meat in a
large vessel. Add paprika and chili powder, stirring to mix all
ingredients, as you add enough water to cover. Simmer for about 1 1/2
hours, adding salt to taste after the chili has cooked somewhat. Make
a paste of the crackermeal or browned flour by mixing with a little
water. About 10 minutes before chili is ready, stir in this
tightener, and cook until chili is thick.
