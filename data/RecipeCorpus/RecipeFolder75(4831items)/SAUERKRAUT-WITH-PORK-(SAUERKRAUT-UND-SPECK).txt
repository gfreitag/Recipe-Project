Title: SAUERKRAUT WITH PORK (SAUERKRAUT UND SPECK)
Categories: Penndutch, Pork
Yield: 1 Servings
3 lb Pork
1 x  Water
1 qt Sauerkraut
1 x  Salt & pepper
Wipe piece of pork with a damp cloth, place in large stewing pan and
cover with cold water. Set over flame to cook slowly for one hour.
Add the sauerkraut and more water if necessary and continue cooking
for another hour or until meat has become thoroughly tender. Season
with salt and pepper. Serve with mashed potatoes. My notes: This is
basically the same way my mom and I prepare sauerkraut and spareribs,
but we add a chopped onion.  My mom also used to add some chopped
apple to cut down on the "sourness".  This is a really simple and
delicious meal, if you like sauerkraut. One of my favorites! Source:
