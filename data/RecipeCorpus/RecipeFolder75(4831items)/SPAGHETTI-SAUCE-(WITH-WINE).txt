Title: SPAGHETTI SAUCE (WITH WINE)
Categories: Beef, Italian, Pasta
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Ground Beef
1    Onion -- chopped
2    To 3 Cloves Garlic -- minced
2    15-Oz Cans Tomato Sauce
2    6-Oz Cans Tomato Paste
1 tb Italian Seasoning -- or
More
1 ds Ground Oregano
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black Pepper
1    Or 2 Glugs White Wine
Brown the beef and onion in a huge skillet.  Add the garlic when the
beef is almost done.  Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste and all
the seasonings. Simmer over low heat while you cook the pasta. Like I
said, about 15 minutes before you're ready to serve, stir the wine
into the sauce.

I've never found it necessary to let spaghetti sauce cook for hours
and hours.  I don't have the time or the patience, and I like my
spaghetti sauce better than anything canned/jarred, or ordered in a
restaurant. It's got a richer taste, what with the amount of tomato
paste I use. Sometimes I use a can of stewed tomatoes in place of one
of the tomato sauces, but that's about the only variation I ever make.
