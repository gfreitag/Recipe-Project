Title: SALT CURED LEG OF LAMB (SPEKEMAT)
Categories: Lamb, Ethnic
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Salt
4 qt Water (less if the leg is
-smaller)
1 tb Sugar
8 lb Leg of lamb
You will need a large saucepan and a large crock. Dissolve the salt
in the water to make a brine.  Add the sugar. Put the leg of lamb in
a large crock and pour enough brine over it to cover it completely.
Put a weight on top to keep it underwater. Leave to take the salt in
a cool pantry (not below the freezing point, or the salting process
comes to a halt) for 2 weeks for a leg weighing 8 lbs (roughly 2 days
per pound of meat.)

Take the leg out after the allotted time and rinse thoroughly so that
you do not get too salty a rind. Hang it out to dry in a well-aired
cool pantry, wrapped in a loose bag of cheesecloth or muslin to
protect it from flies.  It will be dry, delicious, and ready to eat
in 2 to 3 months.

Serve, sliced very thin with a sharp knife, as part of an indoor
picnic meal, with sweet butter, fresh hard-boiled eggs, a sliver of
'geitost' (the Norwegian sweet brown cheese), and flat bread or
potato pancakes to wrap around each morsel.  A bowl of sour cream and
some fresh raspberries can follow as a replacement for Norwegian
cloudberries.

Yield:  3 to 5 lbs dried meat.  Allow 1/4 lb of dried meat per person.
Time:   Start 3 months before you need it; 20 minutes
