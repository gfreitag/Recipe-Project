Title: SALT-RISING BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 3 Servings
3 1/2 c  Thinly sliced new potatoes
5 ts Salt
3 tb Honey
2 tb Yellow cornmeal
4 c  Boiling water
1 ts Baking soda
8 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Milk
2 tb Olive oil
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Place potatoes, 3 teaspoons salt, honey and
cornmeal in a stainless steel bowl and cover with boiling water.
Cover with a cloth and let stand for about 15 hours. Maintain
temperature at about 90F. Drain and discard the potatoes. Reserve the
water. Place baking soda, remaining 2 teaspoons salt and 3 cups of
flour in a mixer, turn to slow speed and add the potato water. Beat
about 5 minutes. Scrape the "sponge" into a mixing bowl, cover with a
damp cloth, place in a warm part of the kitchen and let rise until
bubbles form, about 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, combine milk and olive
oil in a small saucepan, bring to a boil and immediately remove from
the heat. Let cool to lukewarm. Replace the sponge in the mixing
bowl, add the milk and slowly incorporate remaining 5 cups of flour.
Knead with a dough hook for 7 minutes. If dough seems too sticky, add
up to 3/4 cup additional flour. Divide dough in 3 and place in
greased loaf pans. Cover with a damp towel, place in a warm spot and
let rise until doubled in volume. Bake for about 1 hour. Makes 3
