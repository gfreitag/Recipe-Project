Title: SOUP ( STRETCH IT )
Categories: Soup, Soups/stews
Yield: 6 Servings
1 tb Oil
1    Diced onion
1 c  Tomato soup
3 c  Water
1 tb Beef soup mix
3/4 c  Pasta (rainbow)
This is a quick soup but I would add vegetables diced small before
the pasta. Saute the onion in the oil and then add the soup and water
and beef soup mix and pasta. cook few minutes to blend flavors.
