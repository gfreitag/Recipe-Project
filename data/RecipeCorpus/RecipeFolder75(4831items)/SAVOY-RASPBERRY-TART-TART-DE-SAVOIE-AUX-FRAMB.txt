Preheat oven to 375F. Line 9-inch square baking pan with 2-inch high
sides with foil.  Place dough in pan and press out to 1/4 inch
thickness over bottom and 1 inch up sides of pan. Freeze crust until
firm, about
20    minutes.

Line crust with foil.  Fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake
until sides are set, about 20 minutes. Remove beans and foil.
Continue baking until crust is golden, about 15 minutes. Spread jam
evenly over bottom of crust.  Bake until jam is set, about 2 minutes.
Cool crust.

Combine frambois and gelatin in small bowl; let stand until gelatin
softens, about 10 minutes.  Bring milk and vanilla bean to boil in
small saucepan.  Mix yolks, 3 tablespoons sugar and cornstarch in
medium bowl. Gradually add hot milk mixture, whisking until blended.
Return mixture to saucepan.  Whisk over medium ehat until thickened;
boil 1 minute, whisking constantly.  Remove from heat; add framboise
mixture and stir until gelatin dissolves.  Let pastry cream stand
until cool but not set, whisking occasionally, about 15 minutes.

Remove vanilla bean from pastry cream.  Beat whipping cream in medium
bowl until medium-firm peaks form. Fold cream into pastry cream in 2
additions. Spread pastry cream in prepared crust (layer will be
thin). Chill until cream is firmly set, about 2 hours. (Can be made 1
day ahead. Cover; keep chilled.)

Mound raspberries over cream.  Sprinkle lightly with powdered sugar.
