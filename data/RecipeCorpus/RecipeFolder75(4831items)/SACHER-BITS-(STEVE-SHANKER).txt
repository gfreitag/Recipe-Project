We've all heard of Sacher-torte, that wonderfully decadent candy
chocolate glazed torte with the apricot filling. Well, a while back
Deb started to make it but realized she didn't really have the time
on that day and did an experiment instead.  This is every bit as good
as the real thing and a hell of a lot simpler to do. We wanted to see
how raspberry was and it was just as good as the apricot, soooo, make
half and half, or better yet, just do a double batch.  Its sooo good
for the waistline. Make a few batches of this and I guarantee you'll
come away looking just like Santa...ho ho ho!

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Grease a 15x10x1" pan.

In a medium saucepan, melt butter and chocolate over low heat. Remove
from heat; stir in sugar.  Blend in eggs, one at a time. Add vanilla.
Stir in flour. Spread in pan. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, till done. Cool.
Spread preserves over top. Melt chips over low heat and drizzle over
top of pan. Chill to harden.

Cut into small 'brownie' sized pieces and serve.  Best if kept cool.
