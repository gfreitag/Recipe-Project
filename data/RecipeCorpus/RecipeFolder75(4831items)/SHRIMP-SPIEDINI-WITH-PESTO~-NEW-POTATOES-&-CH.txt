Add remaining oil in drizzle to form smooth yet very thick sauce and
set aside. In another processor, place ceci, mint, lemon juice, egg,
garlic and half cup of olive oil and blend until smooth, or 1 minute.
Slowly drizzle in remaining oil to create a creamy sauce.

plate. Cover shrimp with remaining pesto and drizzle with aioli.
