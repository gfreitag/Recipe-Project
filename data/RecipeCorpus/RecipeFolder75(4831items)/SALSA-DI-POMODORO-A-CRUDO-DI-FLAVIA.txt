Cut out the tough area around the core of each tomato and cut the
tomatoes into quarters lengthwise. Using your fingers, push out
excess seeds. Cut the tomatoes into rough dice or chop them coarsely.
Place the tomatoes in the bowl in which you will serve the pasta, or
in a sauce dish if using with fish. Add the basil, garlic, olive oil,
salt, and pepper. Insert a knife into the avocado at the top, where
the navel is. Cut into the avocado until you reach the seed, then
make a clean incision all the way around the length of the fruit.
Grasping onehalf in one hand and the other half in your other hand,
twist the halves in opposite directions to open the avocado. The seed
should fall right out. Peel and thinly slice each half crosswise;
then cut the slices further into small strips or dice. Add the
avocado to the bowl with the other ingredients. Toss to mix and allow
to stand at room temperature while the pasta or fish cooks. Makes
approximately 21/2 cups

Note: This recipe is sufficient for saucing 1 pound of pasta.

Ahead of time note: Make the sauce up to 2 hours in advance. Cover and
leave at room temperature until ready to serve.
