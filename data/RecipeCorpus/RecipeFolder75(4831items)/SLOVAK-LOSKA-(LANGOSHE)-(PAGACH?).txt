Title: SLOVAK LOSKA (LANGOSHE) (PAGACH?)
Categories: Ethnic, Breads
Yield: 4 Servings
3 c  Potatoes,mashed,cool,salted
1/2 c  Flour
Blend flour into mashed potatoes. Add more flour if needed, but not to
much. Dough should not be sticky or crumbly. Divide dough into four
portions and roll out each portiom on floured board to 1/8 inch
thickness in 8 inch circles. Pick surface with a fork to prevent
puffing. Bake in preheated oven at 400 degrees. Bake on bottom
surface of oven, (I use cookie sheets) for about 7 minutes on each
side. After the Loska is baked, brush each side with either plain or
browned butter. Stack on a plate and cut into wedges. Loska is good
with any meatless soup.
As a child, I remember my Grandmother calling this Pagach.
