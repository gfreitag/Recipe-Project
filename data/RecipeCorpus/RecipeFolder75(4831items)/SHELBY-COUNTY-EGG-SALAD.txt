"Egg salads have been a winner on Texas tables for well over a
century. This version, created by Jason Griffin of Center, won a cook
off at the 1986 East Texas Poultry Festival."

Combine all the ingredients together in a med. bowl, and mix
thoroughly. Refrigerate the salad, covered, at least 30 mins. Serve
the salad atop lettuce leaves or spread it on a sandwich. Leftovers
can be kept a couple of days.
