MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 tb Butter or oil
1 lb Frozen spinach; thawed
3    Green onions; sliced
3 tb Minced parsley
2 tb Chopped fresh dill
1/2 lb Feta cheese; crumbled
3    Eggs; lightly beaten
Salt & Pepper to taste
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
1 lb Commercial Filo pastry
1/2 lb Melted butter
In butter or oil, saute green onion until soft. Meanwhile, squeeze out
excess moisture from spinach and chop by hand or in food processor.
Combine green onion with spinach and remaining filling ingredients in
bowl. Mix well and set aside.

Lay out the Filo sheets, covering them with waxed paper and a damp
towel. Take out two sheets at a time and keep the rest covered. Brush
melted butter onto top sheet of each pair. Cut each double-sheet
crosswise into equal strips, about 2-1/2" wide. Place 1 teaspoon of
the filling 1" from the end (nearest you) of each strip. Fold the
strips back over the filling so the bottom edge meets the left edge,
forming a right angle. Continue folding back at right angles to make
a triangular shape. Place on baking sheets and keep covered until all
are ready to bake. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes or
until golden and crisp, turning once. NOTE- Spanakopitas may be
frozen before baking. When ready to bake, separate while still
frozen, spead on baking sheets, and bake as above, allowing an extra
10 minutes baking time.
