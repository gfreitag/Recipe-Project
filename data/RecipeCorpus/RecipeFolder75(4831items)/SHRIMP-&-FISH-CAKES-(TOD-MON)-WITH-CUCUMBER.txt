Recipe by: NURPPL@NURSE.EMORY.EDU * chopped in food processor to a
coarse paste ** Available in some Asian markets.

Combine all of the ingredients except for the cooking oil. Mix well
and form into 3-inch round patties, 1/4 inch thick. Setting the
thrmostat to 360 degrees, heat an electric skillet, placing about 1
inch of oil in the pan. Fry each patty, turning once, until golden
brown. Serve with cucumber condiment that follows.

NOTES: I have always found that the shrimp/fish mixture is too gooey
to work with unless I coat each blob with some plain flour as I start
to form it into a patty. I've also always made smaller patties (about
1.5 inches across and 1/2 inch thick) because this size was easier to
work with. Frying in a wok also works well.
