Title: SCALLOPS~ GRAPEFRUIT & FRIED RICE
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Cooked long grain rice
4 tb Soy sauce
3 tb Oil
1 sm Onion; finely diced
1    Ear of corn, kernels only
1 sm Red pepper; finely chopped
1/2 lb Snow peas; finely chopped
1 tb Dark sesame oil (optional)
1 1/2 lb Bay scallops
1/2 c  Grapefruit juice
2 tb Unsalted butter
COOK THE RICE IN THE normal way and chill in the refrigerator for at
least 6 hours. Toss the rice with the soy sauce and set aside. Heat 2
tablespoons oil in a large skillet or fry pan. Add the onions and
cook 1 minute. Add corn and peppers and cook, stirring, another 2
minutes. Add the snow peas and cook 30 seconds. Add rice and cook,
stirring, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Mix in the sesame
oil and arrange the rice in a ring on a serving platter. Keep warm in
a 250F oven while cooking the scallops. Heat remaining tablespoon oil
in a large non-reactive skillet over high heat until almost smoking.
Add the scallops and cook about 2 minutes without stirring. Using a
wooden spoon, stir to unstick any scallops that have adhered to the
bottom of the skillet. Add the grapefruit juice. Cook about 30
seconds, then remove the scallops, using a slotted spoon, and reserve
on a plate. Reduce heat to medium and boil the grapefruit juice until
reduced by half and it starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Replace
the scallops and any juices that have collected on the plate. Cook
another 30 seconds, remove from the heat and whisk in the butter.
Remove the rice from the oven, pour scallops and sauce into the
center of the rice ring and serve immediately.
