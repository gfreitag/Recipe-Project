This red fruit salad looks quite spectacular, and its flavours live
up to its looks. A lovely dessert for fine summer weather and for
eating 'al fresco'.

Heat the wine with the sugar until the sugar dissolves. Bring to the
boil and pour over the fruit in a bowl. Allow the fruit salad to
stand at room temperature for an hour or two, stirring from time to
time. Chill, and serve with crme fraiche.
