Title: SPANAKOPITA (CHANTILLES)
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 12 Servings
1/3 c  Olive oil or butter
1 sm Bunch scallions; chopped
3 lb Spinach; washed & drained
1 sm Bunch parsley; chopped
1 sm Bunch fresh dill; chopped
Salt & freshly ground pepper
1/2 lb Feta cheese, crumbled
4    Eggs; lightly beaten
12    Commercial filo sheets
6 tb Butter; melted
Bread crumbs, if necessary
Heat the 1/3 cup oil in a large pan and saute the scallions until
soft. Meanwhile, pan the spinach (cook it without adding water, then
drain it thoroughly)  or salt and rinse it (the latter method is used
extensively in Greece, but it not advisable).  Squeeze out excess
liquid. Add the spinach to scallions and stir in the parsley, dill,
and a very little salt and pepper.  Cook gently for 10 minutes, then
cool. (This much can be done in advance and stored in the
refrigerator). Using a wooden spoon, stir in the feta and eggs.

Butter a 9 x 12 x 3-inch baking pan and in it spread 6 filo sheets,
brushing each with melted butter.  Pour in the spinach filling, then
cover with the remaining filo sheets (buttering each as before). Tuck
the top filo over the bottom and flute the edges.  Score the top 3
filo sheets into square or diamond shapes.  Bake in a moderate oven
(350 F) for 40 minutes, or until crisp and a golden chestnut color.
Remove from oven and let stand for 15 minutes before cutting.  Serve
warm.

Note: Some of the favorite variations: Use some nutmeg, or substitute
mint for the dill; use grated cheese instead of feta (be discreet
with the salt if the cheese is salty); add a small handful of raw
long-grain white rice to the filling.  You will surely invent your
own flavor combinations which is why spanakopita is so great.
