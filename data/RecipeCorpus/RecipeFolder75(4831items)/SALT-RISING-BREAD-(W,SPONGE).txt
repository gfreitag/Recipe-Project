Categories: Breads
Yield: 60 Servings
2    Potatoes, med, peel & grate
3 tb Cornmeal
3 tb Sugar
3 c  Water
1 c  Milk
2 tb Crisco
2 ts Baking powder

All purpose flour (enough)
SPONGE: Put potatoes, cornmeal, sugar, salt and boiling water in 1/2
gal glass jar and stir. Set, uncovered, in warm spot overnight. Next
day, strain off foam, keep the liquid and discard the rest.

BREAD: Bring milk to a simmer and add Crisco, baking powder and soda.
Blend in sponge. Put in large bowl, add enough flour to make a stiff
batter which is still pliant enough to beat. Set in a warm place to
rise to double. Add a little more flour to make dough stiff enough to
shape into 3 loaves and let double.  Bake at
350    for about an hour.
