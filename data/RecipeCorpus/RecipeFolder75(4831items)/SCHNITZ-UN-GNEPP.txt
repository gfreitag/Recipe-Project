Apples and buttons, this best-known of all Pennsylvania Dutch dishes
is called. Truly a meal in itself, it contains proteins, starch and
carbohydrates in a giant slab of ham surrounded by raised dumplings
and stewed apples.

To prepare, add apples and their liquid to ham and boil for one hour.
If dried apples are used, they should be soaked overnight first. Add
brown sugar. Prepare dumplings by sifting together flour, baking
powder, salt and pepper. Stir in well-beaten egg, butter and enough
milk to make a stiff but moist batter. Drop batter by large spoonfuls
into main dish, cover tightly and steam for about 20 minutes. Frozen
oven-ready yeast biscuits may be substituted for the dumpling batter.
