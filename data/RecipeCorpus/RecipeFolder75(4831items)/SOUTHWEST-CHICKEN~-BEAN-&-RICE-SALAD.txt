I fix this (and double it) to take to pot luck lunches; today it is
on its way to a dog show. I like to have it once a month anyway. It
has great flavor and it is a complete meal. Great for a cool summer
dinner.

Bring 2 cups of water and 1 cup of chicken broth to boil in a heavy
medium sauce pan. Add rice. Season with salt and pepper; reduce heat
to low. Cover and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed,
about 20 minutes. Tranfer rice to large bowl and cool.

Preheat broiler. Place chicken on heavy broilerproof pan. Brush
chicken with 1/2 tbs of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper
sprinkle with 1 tsp. cumin. Broil chicken until cooked through, about
10 minutes. Cool and cut into 1 inch pieces.

Add chicken, black beans, corn, bell pepper, red onion and cilantro
to rice in boil.  Combine remaining 1/4 cup chicken broth, remaining
tablespoon olive oil, remaining teaspoon cumin, lime juice and garlic
in blender. Process until garlic is finely minced. Season to taste
with salt and pepper. Pour dressing over salad in bowl and toss well.

(Can be prepared up to four hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
