Title: SALMON/TROUT HOLLANDAISE
Categories: Fish and se, Sauces and
Yield: 6 Servings
1 1/2 lb Trout Fillets
Hollandaise Sauce-----
2 tb Water
6    Peppercorns -- slightly
Crushed
1 tb White Wine Vinegar
2    Egg Yolks
3/4 c  Butter
Salt -- to taste
1 tb Lemon Juice
Cut fillets into serving-size portions.  Steam over salted water for
9-10 minute or until fish flakes when tested with a fork. Remove from
heat. Carefully remove fish to heated platter and keep hot.

Make the sauce in a double boiler or an oven-proof bowl over a
saucepan of hot water.  If using the latter method make sure that the
bottom of the bowl is not touching the hot water or the sauce will
set on the bottom of the bowl before it is cooked.

Place the water, crushed peppercorns and white wine vinegar in a small
saucepan and reduce to about 1 tablespoon of liquid. Set aside.

Cut the butter into pieces and soften gently in a small saucepan.
Remove from heat.

Whisk the egg yolks, reduced liquid and a little of the butter in the
double boiler.  When the mixture becomes creamy and slightly thick,
pour in the butter in a thin stream, whisking briskly. Add lemon
juice and a little salt, and taste for seasoning.

Remove from the heat immediately when it is thick. Should the sauce
look as if it is curdling, add a few drops of cold water and whisk
briskly for a few more minutes. This sauce can be made in a blender
or food processor, but you may find that less butter will be
absorbed. The addition of 1 tablespoon of cold water with the lemon
juice will prevent it becoming too thick.

Pour the sauce over the fillets and serve.

Serves 6.
