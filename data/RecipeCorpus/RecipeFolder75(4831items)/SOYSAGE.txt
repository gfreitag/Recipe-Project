Soak the soybeans and one piece of kombu in about five times their

the beans and cook in about 4C water w/the other piece of kombu. Cook
until soft, about four hours, and drain.  Coarsely chop the beans and
kombu, then mix in all remaining ingredients until you get a medium
stiff mess. Pack the mix tightly into an oven safe glass or stainless
steel bowl and cover tightly w/foil, carefully sealing the edges.
Invert a shallow, heat resistant bowl on the bottom of a large stock
pot or dutch oven. Pour in enough water to cover the bowl, then place
the soysage over the bowl. Bring to a simmer, cover and steam about
an hour and a half, checking occaionally to add water if needed.  Let
cool and use.
