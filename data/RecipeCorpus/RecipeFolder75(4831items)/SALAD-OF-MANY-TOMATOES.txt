Categories:
Yield: 6 Servings
3/4 c  Plain lowfat yogurt
3 lb Ripe tomatoes
3 tb Sherry vinegar
1/2 ts Sugar
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black Pepper -- freshly
Ground
3 tb Olive oil
1 bn Chives -- minced
For the tomatoes, choose the greatest variety possible--different
sizes and shapes- (for example, red, yellow, striped, cherry,
beefsteak, plum, pear, etc.) Two hours ahead of time, place the
yogurt in a strainer lined with a coffee filter and set over a bowl.
Place in the refrigerator and let yogurt drain for two hours. At
serving time, cut large tomatoes into chunks or wedges; cut small
tomatoes in half or quarters. Place all tomatoes in large bowl. Place
vinegar in small bowl and whisk in sugar, salt, pepper and drained
yogurt. Drizzle in olive oil while whisking so as to form an
emulsion. Pour over tomatoes, add chives, and stir. Serve over pieces
of toasted country bread. Yield: 6 servings Copyright, 1996, TV FOOD
