Title: SEASONED FLAT BREAD
Categories: Breads
Yield: 1 Servings
1 1/2 c  Warm water
1 pk Active dry yeast
6 c  Flour
1 ts Olive oil
MMMMM-------------------------SEASONING------------------------------
2 ts Dried oregano
2 ts Dried basil
1/2 ts Dried savory
1/2 ts Dried rosemary
2 ts Dried lemon peel
In a large bowl combine the reast and the warm water. Let rest for 2
minutes.

Add 5 cups of the flour to the yeast mixture. Stir until well
combined. Add the remaining flour, a little at a time, stirring until
a dough forms. Do not add all the flour if it is not needed.

Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes or
until dough is no longer sticky and is smooth. Shape the dough into a
ball. Place 1/2 teaspoon of the olive oil in your hand. Roll the
dough around in your hand until it is coated with oil. Place dough in
a large bowl and cover with a towel. Let rise in a warm draft-free
place for 35 minutes until doubled in size.

In a small bowl combine the dried oregano, basil, savory, rosemary,
and lemon peel.

Punch the dough down and divide it in half. Flatten each half until it
resembles a plate sized round. Brush the tops of the loaves with the
remaining oil. Sprinkle the tops of the loves with the seasoning
mixture.

Place the loaves on baking sheets. Cover loaves with bowls and let
rise in a warm draft free place for 30 minutes until doubled in size.

Preheat oven to 400F.  Bake for 30 minutes or until tops are golden
brown. Remove from oven. Cool or serve warm.
