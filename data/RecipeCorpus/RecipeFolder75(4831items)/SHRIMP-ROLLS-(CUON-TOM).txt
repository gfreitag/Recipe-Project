rice papers and simply wrap the filling in lettuce leaves. The rolls
can be assembled ahead of time and served as an appetizer. Or the
wrappers can be placed on the table (with bowls of warm water for
softening) with a platter of fillings, so that guests can make a meal
of them. One half fresh pineapple, peeled, eyes removed, halved,
cored and thinly sliced, 2 tomatoes, thinly sliced, 1/2 cup fresh
cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped, 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves,
coarsely chopped Nuoc Cham dipping sauce, with carrot shreds
DIRECTIONS: Cook shrimp in salted, boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes,
or until pink and firm to the touch. Drain and cool. Peel and devein
shrimp, or serve them in their shells and let diners peel them at the
table. Blanch bean sprouts in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and
refresh with cold water.

To assemble: Moisten rice papers in warm water for 10 to 20 seconds,
or until softened. Place a lettuce leaf inside each piece of softened
rice paper. Fill with a few shrimp, a little pineapple, bean sprouts,
tomato, cilantro and/or mint. Roll up the bundles and serve with Nuoc
Cham.
