2 c  Flour
1/4 c  Water; more or less; hot
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------

1/4 ts Szechuan peppercorns;
- toasted and crushed
A very simple and filling Shanghai staple.

Put flour in a food processer. Gradually add water (your mileage may
vary) while mixing until the dough forms into a ball. Roll out on a
floured surface to about 1/16" thick. Use a glass to cut into 3"
circles. Set wrappers aside.

Mix filling ingredients.

To assemble, put a wrapper in the palm of your hand. Place about 1
tablespoon of the filling in the wrapper and fold in half. Keep 1/4"
of the wrapper free of stuffing for a good seal. Moisten edge with
water. Crimp the edges together using your first 2 fingers and thumb,
fluting the edges. Go around in one direction, flip over, then
reverse. The idea is to seal them good! Cool in the 'fridge for at
least an hour.

Steam for 20 minutes; let cool.

Deep fry until golden brown. Serve hot.

Variations/notes: * Place each dumpling on a small piece of cabbage or
lettuce to
prevent sticking to the steamer rack. * Try boned pork steaks, fat
removed, ground in a food processor. * Also try shrimp, chicken, or a
combo of all. * Hot peppers, or pepper sauce, may be added to the
filling. * The steam/cool/fry technique is the only way it matches
the real
thing! But these are also good just steamed.  I usually do them
mixed.

Sauces: Chopped garlic and light soy sauce
Coleman's Dry Mustard mixed with cold water or light soy sauce
Sesame oil, toasted sesame seeds, and dark soy sauce
Hot pepper sauce of your choice

Makes about 16 dumplings.

Personal Note: When in Shanghai, I visited a restaurant that served
only dumplings, on Nanjing Lu. They had =so= many variations of
fillings and sauces; it was incredible. When I asked how the wrappers
were made, I was told just mix flour and water, nothing else.
