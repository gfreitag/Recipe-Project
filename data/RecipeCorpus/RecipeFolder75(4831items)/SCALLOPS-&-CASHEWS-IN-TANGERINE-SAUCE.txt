This recipe can be adapted beautifully to be vegetarian! I love this
dish with cubed tofu instead of scallops, and if you can't find a
vegetarian oyster sauce, just substitute a bit of soy sauce or
experiment with your favorite Asian sauce.  -KM

ADVANCE PREPARATION:  Place the nuts and oil in a small saucepan over
medium-high heat.  Stir the nuts occasionally and when they turn very
light golden, drain immediately and pat dry on paper towels. Pour off
and reserve 2 tablespoons of the cooking oil for stir-frying.

Set aside in separate containers the green onions, garlic, and
scallops. In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients and mix well.

LAST-MINUTE COOKING:  Combine the cornstarch with an equal amount of
cold water.  Set aside.

Place a wok over highest heat.  Whent the wok is very hot, add the
reserved oil to the center.  Roll the oil around the sides of wok and
add the garlic.  When it just begins to turn white, in about 15
seconds, add the scallops.  Stir-fry until the scallops just lose
their raw outside color, about 1 minute.

Stir in the green onions and pour in the sauce.  When the sauce comes
to a low boil, stir in a little of the cornstarch mixture so that
sauce glazes the scallops. Stir in the cashews, then taset and adjust
the seasonings. Spoon onto a heated platter or individual plates.
Serve at once.
