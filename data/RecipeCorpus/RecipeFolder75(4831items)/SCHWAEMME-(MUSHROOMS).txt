In Swabia this refers only to king boletes with their yellow- green
underneath side, who do not discolor when cut into, and to the yellow,
firm-stemmed chanterelle.

a few drops lemon juice

Clean the mushrooms.  On larger king boletes, remove the greenish
underneath side of the cap.  Cut large mushrooms into 1/6-inch thick
slices.  In a wide saucepan, melt the butter, then add mushrooms and
water or broth.  The mushrooms will be tender shortly after the
liquid reaches a rolling boil.  Stir in the flour paste, and briefly
bring to a boil again. Remove from the heat. Stir in the cream and
chopped parsley, and season to taste.  Serve with potato dumplings or
bread dumplings.

Serves 4.
