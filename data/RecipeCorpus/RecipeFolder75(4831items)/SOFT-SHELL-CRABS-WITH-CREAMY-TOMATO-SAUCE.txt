Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 Servings
MMMMM---------------------YIELD: 4 SERVINGS--------------------------
6 tb Olive oil
6    Garlic clove; thinly sliced
6 lg Shallots; thinly sliced
1/2 ts Cumin seeds
1/4 ts Celery seeds
1/4 ts Crushed red pepper
1 ts Salt
1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 ts Sugar
35 oz Tomatoes, whole; packed in
-juice, drained & chopped
1 c  Creme fraiche
1 c  Flour
8    Soft-shell crabs; cleaned
In a large nonreactive skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil
over moderate heat for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and shallots and
cook, stirring frequently, until the shallots are translucent and the
garlic begins to brown, 5 to 6 minutes (don't let the garlic get too
brown or it will be bitter).  Stir in the cumin and celery seeds, red
pepper and 1/2 teaspoon each of the salt and black pepper. Cook for 1
minute longer. Stir in the sugar and tomatoes and bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat to moderately low and simmer the sauce for 15
minutes. Add the creme fraiche and simmer for 6 minutes longer. Cover
and keep warm. (The sauce can be made up to 1 day ahead. Cover and
refrigerate. Reheat before serving.) Preheat the oven to 250F.  On a
plate, toss the flour with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon each of salt
and black pepper. Pat the crabs dry with paper towels and dredge them
in the seasoned flour. In a large skillet, preferably nonstick, heat
2 tablespoons of the olive oil over moderately high heat. Add 4 of
the crabs and cook, turning once, until red and crisp, about 3
minutes per side. Transfer the crabs to a heatproof platter and place
in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons
olive oil and 4 crabs.  To serve, spoon the tomato sauce onto 4
warmed plates and arrange 2 crabs on the sauce on each plate. Recipe
