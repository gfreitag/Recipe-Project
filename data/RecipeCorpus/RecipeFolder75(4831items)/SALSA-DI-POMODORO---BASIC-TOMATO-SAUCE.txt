:30 Heat the oil in a large pot and saute the onion, garlic and
seasonings for 5 minutes. Pour the tomatoes into a bowl and mash them
up, removing any hard parts.  Add to the pot with the tomato paste,
red wine, and butter. Simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring
frequently. The sauce should be fairly thick when ready. When you
notice the golden oil floating on the top of the sauce it has
finished cooking.  Now check the seasonings and you're done. Very
easy! Makes 1 gallon/4 litres From Chef Pasqualie Carpino's Italian
