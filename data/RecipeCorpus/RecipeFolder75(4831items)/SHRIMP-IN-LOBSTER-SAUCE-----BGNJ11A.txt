Peel, devein and butterfly shrimp. To butterfly, with a sharp knife,
cut through the back about 3/4 of the way. Do not cut all the way
through, remove black vein. set aside. Heat wok till smoking, add
oil, put all shrimp in at once, stir fry, keeping them in motion
continuously so they cook evenly. When they begin to curl, remove and
set aside. Soak black beans, rinse and mash. Heat wok, add 2 tbs oil,
add beans and garlic, stir till aroma is strong, add meat in small
pieces, stir fry until cooked, about 4 minutes. Add broth, soy and
sugar, stirring until it comes to a boil. Thicken mixture with
cornstarch paste, a little at a time, do not let it get too thick,
should be like a cream sauce. Slowly stir in beaten eggs. Cook one
minute, then add shrimp. Mix well and serve. *note* Fermented black
beans have a flavor that is very unique. Do not substitute with any
other black bean mixture as it will change the taste quite a bit. If
you do, lotsa luck.... FBB are small, black, dry ! ! and very salty.
Oriental groceries, and sometimes supermarkets.. KEEP ON STIR FRYIN,
