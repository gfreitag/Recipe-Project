In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the oil with the garlic over
moderate heat. When the garlic sizzles, add the tomatoes, crushing
them with your hands, and stir in the fish stock, lemon juice, tomato
paste, sugar and bay leaf.

Simmer for 7 to 10 minutes, until thick but still fairly liquid. Then
stir in the scallops and the spinach and continue simmering until the
scallops are cooked through and the sauce is thick, 3 to 5 minutes
more. Serve over cooked pasta -- suggestions: spaghetti, linguine, or
fettuccine.
