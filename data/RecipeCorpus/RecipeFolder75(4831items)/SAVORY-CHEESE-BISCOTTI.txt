Title: SAVORY CHEESE BISCOTTI
Categories: Breads
Yield: 24 Servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Yellow cornmeal
1 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Dried basil
1/2 c  Nonfat sour cream
2 tb Margarine -- melted
3    Egg whites
1/2 c  Shredded smoked cheddar
Cheese -- (2 ounces)
Vegetable cooking spray
Combine first 6 ingredients in a large bowl. Combine sour cream and
next 2 ingredients in a small bowl; stir with a wire whisk until
blended. Stir in cheese; add to flour mixture,stirring until
well-blended (dough will be crumbly).

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead lightly
7 or 8 times. Shape dough into a 16-inch-long roll. Place roll on a
baking sheet coated with cooking spray, and flatten roll to 1-inch
thickness.

Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Remove roll from baking sheet to
a wire rack, and let cool 10 minutes. Cut roll diagonally into 24
(1/2-inch) slices, and place, cut sides down, on baking sheet. Reduce
oven temperature to 325 degrees, and bake 15 minutes. Turn slices
over, and bake an additional 15 minutes (biscotti will be slightly
soft in center but will harden as they cool). Remove from baking
sheet; let cool completely on wire rack. Yield: 2 dozen (serving
size: 1 biscotti).
