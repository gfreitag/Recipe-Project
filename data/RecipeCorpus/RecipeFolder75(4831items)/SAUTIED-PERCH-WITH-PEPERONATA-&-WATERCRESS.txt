pepper and set aside.

Season perch fillets with salt and pepper. In a 14-inch non-stick
sautJ pan, heat 4 remaining tablespoons olive oil until smoking.
Place seasoned fillets, skin side down, and gently shake pan so they
do not stick. Cook 6 to 7 minutes over medium high heat until skin is
crisp and fillets and cooked through. Flip fillets over, add
peperonata to pan and bring to boil. Remove fish immediately to
separate warm plates and divide warm pepper mixture over diagonally.
Drizzle with watercress pesto and serve immediately.
