I've just made it once, but we loved it and it will probably be a
family favorite. Heat butter in a large saucepan over low heat until
melted. Add garlic.
Stir in flour and salt.  Cook, stirring constantly until bubbly.
Remove from heat.  Stir in milk, broth and white wine. Return to
stove and heat until boiling, stirring constantly. Boil for one
minute. Stir in mozzarella, onions, basil and pepper.  Cook over low
heat until cheese is melted, stirring constantly. Spread about 1 1/2
cups of the sauce in an ungreased 9X13 pan.  Top with uncooked
lasagna noodles, overlapping as needed.  Spread cottage cheese over
the noodles. Spread with another 1 1/2 cups of sauce, and then with
another 5 noodles. Top with seafood and another round of sauce.  Add
last 5 noodles and top with all remaining sauce.  If desired top with
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 deg. for
35-40 minutes or until the noodles are tender. Let stand for 15
minutes before cutting. When I made this, I just used 1 cup each of
shrimp and faux crab meat, and skipped the scallops.
The "crab" was just fine.  I mashed the cottage cheese, since I
don't like the texture of curds.  Next time I'll use ricotta. Make
sure when you measure the last sauce that you leave at least 1 1/2
cups for the top, so you don't have crispy noodle tips exposed.
Also, we didn't want to overlap the noodles so much, so we just
broke them to make a complete layer.
Hope you like this as much as we did! FROM: HEIDI MCCULLOUGH
