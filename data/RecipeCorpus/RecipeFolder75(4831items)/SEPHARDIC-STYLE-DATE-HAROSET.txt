Title: SEPHARDIC-STYLE DATE HAROSET
Categories: Cyberealm, Kooknet, Jewish
Yield: 2 Cups
1 lb Pitted dates, chopped
1 1/2 c  Warm water
2    -4 Tbsp sweet read Pesach
.wine (optional)
1/2    - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2    - 1 cup finely chopped wal-
.nuts and/or almonds
If desired you can substitute dark raised for up to half the dates.
Put the dates and water into a medium sized saucepan and let them
soak for 1 hour. Then bring them to a boil over high heat. Lower the
heat, cover, and simmer for 30-60 minutes, or until they are very
soft and form a paste. During the cooking period, stir the dates
often, and mash then with a spoon to help break them down. To smooth
out the paste, press it through a sieve, colander, or food mill, or
puree it in a food processor. If the puree is too thin and does not
have a rich date taste, return it to the saucepan and simmer it down
to the desired consistency, keeping in mind that it will thicken
slightly more as it cools. Let the date paste cool to room
temperature. Stir in the desired amounts of wine and cinnamon. Stir
in the nuts and/or sprinkle them on top. Store the paste in the
refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to 2 weeks. For the best
flavor, let it come to room temperature before serving.
