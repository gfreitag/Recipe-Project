Title: SIMPLE FF CREAM CHEESE ICING (LACTO)
Categories: Digest, Nov.
Yield: 1 Servings
x  FF cream cheese
x  Maple syrup
Use a blender, and put in Maple syrup until the mixture is sweet
enough. Only disadvage: if you keep it in the fridge for a while,
some cracks appear in the icing. So, I suggest you cool the icing in
a bowl, then put it on just before serving the cake.
