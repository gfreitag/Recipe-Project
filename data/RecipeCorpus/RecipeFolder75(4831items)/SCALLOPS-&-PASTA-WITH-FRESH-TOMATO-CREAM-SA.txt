Plunge the tomatos into the water for 10 to 15 seconds or until the
skin just begins to show a tiny split or two. Remove and let cool for
a second or two and then peel the tomato under running water. Slice
into halves and gently squeeze the tomato to force out the seeds.
Chop the tomato quickly into a glass bowl until ready for use. (Glass
or glazed china is important because of the acid)
