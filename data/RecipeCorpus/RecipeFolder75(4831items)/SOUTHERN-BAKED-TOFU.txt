Title: SOUTHERN BAKED TOFU
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings
-===================
Ingredients:

garbanzo flour or brown rice flour corn flakes celery salt sage touch
of salt nutritional yeast (lots) margerine corn meal tofu Cup up as
much tofu as you think you'll eat into 1/4 inch thick slices. In a
medium bowl mix up all the dry ingredients.  In a small skillet, heat
up 1/2 1 stick margerine.  When completely melted, dip tofu into
margerine enough to moisten the surface.  Transfer tofu to dry
breading, and cover both sides. Transfer breaded tofu to a lightly
greased tray, casserole dish, or cookie sheet. Bake until
crunchy/warm.

It tastes delicious by itself, but a nutritional yeast gravy might
taste good on top. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40
