Title: SCOTTISH OAT SCONES
Categories: Breakfast
Yield: 1 Servings
2/3 c  Butter, melted*
1/3 c  Milk
1 ea Egg
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour*
1 1/4 c  Quick Quaker Oats, uncooked
1/4 c  Sugar
1 tb Baking powder
1 ts Cream of tartar
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Raisins or currants*
(My comment: Preheat oven to 425 F.  I suggest you plump the
raisins.) (I vary the items marked *)
Add butter, milk and egg to combined dry ingredients; mix just
until dry ingredients are moistened. Stir in raisins. Shape dough to
form ball*; pat out on lightly floured surace to form 8-inch circle*.
Cut into 8 to 12* wedges; bake on greased cookie sheet in preheated
hot oven (425 F.) 12 to 15 minutes or until light golden brown.
Serve warm at breakfast or brunch with butter, preserves or honey, as
desired.
Made as above, with BUTTER, these are absolutely wonderful! The
buttery aroma is to die for!  However, I seldom make them that way
because of the cholesterol and because my wife and I almost always
use whole wheat flour.
