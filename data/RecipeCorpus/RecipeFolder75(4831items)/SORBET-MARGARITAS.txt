Title: SORBET MARGARITAS
Categories: Beverages, Dkuhnen msn
Yield: 4 Servings
1/2 c  Tequila
1 tb Grand marnier or triple sec
1/2 c  Orange juice
1 pt Your favorite fruit sorbet
Lemon juice or lime juice
Combine tequila, liqueur, O.J. and sorbet in a food processor or
blender. Using high speed, mix until the mixture looks slushy. You
might have to use a spatula to clean the sides of the processor, to
ensure it mixes evenly. Add the lime or lemon juice, a little at a
time until it tastes just right! Serve in maragarita glasses, with
salted rims. Adapted by Deborah Kuhnen from "Sunset" magazine, July
