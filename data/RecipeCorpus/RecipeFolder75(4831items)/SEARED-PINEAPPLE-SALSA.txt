Title: SEARED PINEAPPLE SALSA
Categories: Sauces, Fruits, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 3 Cups
1    Pineapple, peeled & cored
1/4 c  Red bell pepper, diced
2 ts Chipotle chile puree
2 tb Orange juice
1 tb Lime juice
1 tb Cilantro, minced
2 ts Brown sugar
Cut pineapple into slices no more than 1/4" thick. Cut each slice in
half. Dry saute the pineapple slices in a skillet for 8 minutes or
so. You want it to be caremalized & golden brown, be careful not to
use too high a heat. When cooked, dice & transfer to a mixing bowl.

Stir in the remaining ingredients & taste to see if you need more lime
juice or chile puree.

This salsa rates a cool 4 out of 10.  As a variation, replace the
pineapple with peaches & cook using the same directions.
