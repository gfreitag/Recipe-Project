Title: SNAILS~ PORTUGUESE STYLE
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 4 Servings
2 lb Small snails
1 tb Olive oil
1 sm Bunch dry oregano
1    Laurel leaf
1    Garlic clove, minced
1 sm Onion, peeled, quartered
Sal & pepper

Try to obtain snails about 1/2" diameter. Starve them for 3 or 4 days
to get rid of any toxic herbs they may have ingested. Wash snails in
running water till all the slime is gone. Place them in a large pan
and cover with water (2" or 3" above snails). Add all the other
ingredients. Cover the pan tightly.  Heat the water over a very slow
fire so that snails have time to extend heads outside shells.

Let boil slowly  for the first hour. Skim and simmer for another
hour, Skim again and serve  warm in saucers, with a little of the
cooking liquid. Use toothpicks or pins to extract snails from shell.
Dip small pieces of bread in the cooking liquid. Refrigerates well -
use any leftovers within a week. Suggested wines: Portuguese Vinho
Verde, or a dry white wine.
