Categories: Fish, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Main dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 Servings
2 c  Large, homemade croutons
1 lb Large shrimp (abt. 24)
-- shelled and deveined
1 tb Flour
1/4 c  Olive oil
1/2 c  Unsalted butter
2    Garlic cloves
-- peeled and quartered
1/3 c  Dry white wine
2 md Tomatoes; peeled
-- seeded, coarsely chopped
1 tb Chopped fresh basil
1 tb Chopped fresh oregano
Salt and pepper; to taste
Cut thick slices (about 4) of French bread into quarters. Drizzle
with some olive oil.  Bake in a hot oven until golden brown, turning
several times. Can be made in advance and kept in a sealed container
for several days. These will be your croutons.

To cook tableside, choose a large chafing dish or skillet that sits
securely over a flame.

Prepare ingredients ahead of time and place in individual bowls.
Lightly sprinkle shrimp with flour. Heat oil and butter in skillet
until bubbling. Add quartered garlic cloves and cook, stirring, over
medium heat for several minutes, to infuse butter with garlic
essence. Remove garlic.

Add shrimp and cook briefly on one side - just until they turn pink.
With tongs, quickly turn and cook other side. Add white wine,
tomatoes, herbs, salt and pepper. Cook 2 minutes longer, stirring
frequently.

Place croutons in and around the shrimp.  Turn to let both sides of
croutons absorb some of the butter-garlic juices. Serve at once,
giving each person several shrimp and croutons, then spooning over
some of the tomatoes and sauce.
