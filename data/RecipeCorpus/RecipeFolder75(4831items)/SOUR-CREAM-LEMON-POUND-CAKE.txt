Categories: Cyberealm, Mom's best, Cakes, Low-fat
Yield: 24 Servings
2/3 c  Margarine, softened
2 2/3 c  Sugar
1 1/4 c  Egg substitute, thawed
1 1/2 c  Low-fat sour cream
1 ts Baking soda
4 1/2 c  Sifted flour
1/4 ts Salt
2 ts Vanilla
Vegetable cooking spray
1/2 c  Sifted powdered sugar
1 ts Grated lemon rind
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
Lemon slices (optional)
Lemon rind curls (optional)
1. Beat margarine at medium speed of an electric mixer until creamy;
gradually add 2 2/3 cups sugar, beating well. 2. Add egg substitute,
and beat well. 3. Combine sour cream and soda; stir well. Combine
flour and salt; add to margarine mixture alternately with sour cream
mixture, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Mix after each
addition. Stir in vanilla (writers' note.. at this point, I added a
tablespoon of fresh lemon juice also!). 4. Spoon batter into a 10
inch tube pan coated with cooking spray. Bake at 325F for 1 hour and
20 minutes, or until a wooden pick comes out clean. Cool in pan for
10 minutes. 5. Remove cake from pan. Combine powdered sugar, lemon
juice and lemon rind. Drizzle over cake. Let cake cool completely on
wire rack. If desired, garnish with lemon slices and lemon rind
curls. Yield: 24 servings (242 calories per slice). Note: I reduced
the fat content by using low-fat margarine, and it came out just
fine!!
