Title: SHORTCAKE BISCUIT CRUST
Categories: Cakes
Yield: 12 Servings
2 1/2 c  Cake flour, sifted
5 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
4 tb Shortening
2/3 c  Milk
Mix and sift together the flour, baking powder and salt, and cut in
the shortening; use the milk cautiously in mixing the dry ingredients
to a soft dough.  Spread the dough in two well-greased layer-cake
pans. Bake in a 400 F. oven about fifteen minutes. Spread the crusts
with creamed butter, and finish with sugared berries between and
above the crusts. Blackberries, raspberries, sliced fresh or canned
peaches and apricots make choice shortcakes.
