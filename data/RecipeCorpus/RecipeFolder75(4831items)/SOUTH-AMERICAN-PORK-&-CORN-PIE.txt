Categories: Meats, Vegetables, Casseroles
Yield: 4 Servings
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
1 md Yellow onion, chopped
1 c  Cubed cooked pork
1/3 c  Plus 1 Tbl all-purpose flour
1 tb Chili powder
1 c  Chicken broth
1 pk Frozen whole-kernel corn,

1/4 c  Raisins
1/4 c  Chopped black olives

1 c  Milk
2/3 c  Cornmeal
1    Egg, lightly beaten
2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a 9-inch ovenproof skillet or a 1
quart flameproof casserole, over medium heat. Add the onion and cook,
uncovered, for 5 minutes. Add the pork and cook until lightly
browned, about 2 minutes.  Blend in 1 tablespoon of the flour, the
chili powder, and the chicken broth.  Add the corn, raisins, olives,
and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Stir until the mixture thickens, about
4 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450F.  Stir the lemon juice into the
milk in a small bowl and let stand for a few minutes. Combine the
cornmeal with the remaining flour and salt in a mixing bowl.  In the
order listed, gradually stir in the milk mixture, egg, baking powder,
baking soda, and remaining oil. Reheat the pork mixture. Stir the
topping mixture and pour over the pork. Bake, uncovered, until the
topping is firm, about 20 minutes.

NOTE:   If you do not have an ovenproof skillet or flameproof
casserole, use a regular skillet to make the pork mixture and
transfer it to a casserole just before baking.
