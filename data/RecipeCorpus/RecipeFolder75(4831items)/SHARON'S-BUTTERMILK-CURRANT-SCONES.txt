Title: SHARON'S BUTTERMILK CURRANT SCONES
Categories: Desserts, Biscuits
Yield: 16 Scones
3 c  Flour
1 c  Buttermilk
1/3 c  Sugar, plus
2 tb Sugar
3/4 c  Currants
1 ts Grated orange rind,
-orange part, or zest, only
2 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
3/4 ts Salt
1 tb Heavy cream
3/4 c  Butter
1/4 ts Cinnamon
These scones have a fine, dense crumb with a little orange and
cinnamon - a delicious combination of texture and flavour.

Preheat the oven to 400F.

Use an ungreased baking sheet.

Combine the flour, 1/3 cup of the sugar, baking powder, baking soda,
and salt in a mixing bowl. Stir with a fork to mix well and aerate.
Cut the butter into the flour mixture, using a pastry blender or two
knives or working with your fingertips, until the mixture looks like
fresh crumbs. Add the buttermilk, currants, and orange rind. Mix only
until the dry ingredients are moistened.

Gather the dough into a ball and press so it holds together. Turn the
dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead lightly twelve times.
Divide the dough in two and pat each half into a circle 1/2 to 3/4
inch thick.

In a small bowl combine the cream, cinnamon, and remaining 2 tb sugar,
stirring to blend. Brush the dough with this glaze.

Cut each circle into eight scone shape pieces (circular, or wedge).
Place the scones slightly apart on the baking sheet. Bake for about
12-15 minutes, or until the tops are browned.

Serve hot.
