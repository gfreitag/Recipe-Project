~---------------- Heat oven to 350oF. Cut 2 pieces of parchment paper
or aluminum foil, each about 16" X 24"; then fold crosswise in half
so each piece measures 12" X 16". Cut half heart from each folded
piece to make a full heart when unfolded. Place potatoes in small
saucepan. Add cold water to cover and salt water. Heat to boiling,
then cook over medium heat 3 minutes. Drain thoroughly. Open paper
hearts and place potatoes in center of each heart next to fold.
Combine remaining ingredients in mixing bowl and spoon over potatoes.
Fold paper over and double fold edges to seal tightly. Place packets
on baking sheet and bake 30 minutes. Transfer packets to plates and
open.  From: Syd's Cookbook.
