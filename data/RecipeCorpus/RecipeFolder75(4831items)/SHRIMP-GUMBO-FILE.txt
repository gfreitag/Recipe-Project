Shell the shrimp, season highly and scald in boiling water. Heat lard
in a kettle and when hot, add the flour to make a brown roux. When
quite brown, without a semblance of burning, add chopped onion and
parsley. Fry these, and when brown, add chopped bay leaf; pour in hot
oyster liquor and hot water. Bring to a good boil and, five minutes
before serving, add shrimp and remove from the stove. Season with
salt and pepper to taste. Gumbo file may be added now to the shrimp
stew (2 Tbsp) or individually to each dish by individual taste.
