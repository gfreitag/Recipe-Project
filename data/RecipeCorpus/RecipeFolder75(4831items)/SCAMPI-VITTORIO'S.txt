Vittorio's restaurant in the Rice Village, owned by Victor Assandri,
was on of the first restaurants to expose Houston to the wonderful
regional dishes of Northern Italy in the late '60's and early '70's.
The secrets to success with this succulent shrimp dish are using
fresh ingredients, especially shrimp, parsley and lemon juice, and
not over cooking the shrimp.

DIRECTIONS: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
shrimp, garlic and parsley and saute until shrimp turn pink, about 2
minutes. Turn shrimp and season with salt and pepper. Stir in lemon
juice and wine and simmer about 2 minutes more. Don't over cook or
shrimp will be rubbery. Makes 4 servings.
