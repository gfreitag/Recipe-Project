Title: SAVORY STUFFED ACORN OR BUTTERNUT SQUASH
Categories: Main dish
Yield: 1 Servings  1 ea specified ingredients (follows)

Split and clean butternut or acorn squash. Cook face down on oiled
pan in 350 F oven for about 30 mins or until tender.

While doing that, assemble:

Enough cooked wild rice for the number of squash to be stuffed. Some
golden delicious apples, peeled and cubed. A mirepoix made from
chopped onions, chopped celery and chopped carrots, sauted in a
little sesame oil. (At least one medium onion, one rib of celery and
one small carrot per two persons; 1 tsp sesame oil and 1+ of canola
oil.) A handful of dark raisins A few chopped pecans or walnuts A
dash or two of ground cloves A splash of dry vermouth, sherry or
madeira Enough frozen orange juice concentrate to moisten the above
Some good toasted bread or muffin crumbs.

Prepare the mirepoix by cooking onions in oil, adding carrots, and
then adding celery. Chop the apples. If delayed, mix OJ concentrate
with apples to prevent discoloration. Mix all ingredients. Season to
taste. Stuff into squash, top with crumbs and return to 350 F oven
until thoroughly hot to cook out the alcohol.

Almost everything above is optional, but the magic is in the cloves,
vermouth and OJ. The taste is savory sweet and the texture is slightly
crunchy, both of which nicely complement the squash. Bon apptit!
