Title: SIMPLE VEGETABLE RAGOUT WITH PARSLEY
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 Servings
3 ea Morels, dried
1 1/2 tb Sunflower oil
1/2 lb Yellow onions, thinly sliced
2 ea Garlic cloves, chopped
1/2 lb Carrots, thickly sliced
1 1/4 c  Vegetable stock
1/2 lb New potatoes, sliced
Salt and pepper, to taste
1/2 lb Zucchini, sliced
1/2 lb Fresh button mushrooms
1/2 lb Shelled peas
1 c  Parsley, chopped
2 tb Mint, chopped
1 tb Soy sauce (opt'l.)
Soak the dried mushrooms in hot water until they are soft, about 20
to 30 minutes. In a large saucepan, frying pan or wok with a cover,
heat the oil and saute the onions over medium heat until they are
transparent but still maintain their shape, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add
the garlic, carrots, and about 1/2 c. stock.  Cover tightly and
continue to cook until the carrots are tender-crisp, about 10
minutes. Add potatoes and cook an additional 15 minutes.  If the
ingredients seem too dry, add more stock. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. Add zucchini, cover again, and cook for another 5
minutes. Add the fresh and dried mushrooms and the peas. Simmer for
another 5 minutes, until all the vegetables are lightly cooked. Stir
in the parsley and mint. If desired, add soy sauce just before
serving.
