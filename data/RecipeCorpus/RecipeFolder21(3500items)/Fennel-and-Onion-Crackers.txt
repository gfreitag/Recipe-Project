Title: Fennel and Onion Crackers
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 70 servings
2 c  All-purpose flour
2 tb Fennel seeds
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Black pepper
6 tb (1/4 cup plus 2 Tb)
Shortening
2 tb (1/4 stick) butter or

1 1/4 c  Minced onion (about one
Medium onion)
2 tb Water
"These crackers are flaky and tender, yet crisp. Packed with onions
and lots of licorice-like fennel flavor, they are almost addictive.
375~F. 15 to 20 minutes Preheat the oven to 375~F.

Roughly grind the fennel seeds in a food mill or blender or chop them
by hand with a knife. You may want to do a large batch so that you
have them on hand for the next time you bake this cracker. If you
want a stronger fennel flavor, grind a little extra for the tops of
the crackers.

In the food processor or in a large bowl, combine the flour, fennel,
salt, and pepper. Cut in the shortening and butter until the mixture
resembles coarse meal. Stir in the minced onion. Blend in enough of
the water to form a smooth dough that will hold together in a
cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out into a rectangle 1/8 to 1/4 inch
thick. If desired, sprinkle lightly and evenly with extra ground
fennel seeds and gently roll the rolling pin over the dough. With a
sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares and transfer to an ungreased
baking sheet. Prick each square 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges.
Cool on a rack. Yield: 65-70.
