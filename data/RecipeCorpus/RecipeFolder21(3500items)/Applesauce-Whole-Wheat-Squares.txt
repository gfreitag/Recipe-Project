Title: Applesauce-Whole Wheat Squares
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 55 servings
2 c  Whole wheat or whole wheat
Pastry flour
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Plus 1 Tablespoon oil
1 c  Apple sauce
"Their true applesauce taste makes these crackers a welcome
after-school snack. 350~F. 15 to 20 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.

Stir together the flour, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl or in the
food processor. Add the oil and blend until the mixture resembles
coarse meal. Add the apple sauce and mix well. Gather into a ball. If
dough is too wet, knead in a little flour.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/16 to 1/8 inch. With a sharp
knife, cut into 2-inch squares. Arrange on a baking sheet. Prick each
square 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 10 minutes. Turn and continue baking for another 5 to 10
minutes, or until crisp. Cool on a rack. Yield: 50-55.

VARIATION: If you want a sweeter cracker, sprinkle the tops with
turbinado sugar. Roll the rolling pin lightly over the tops before
cutting to press in the sugar.
