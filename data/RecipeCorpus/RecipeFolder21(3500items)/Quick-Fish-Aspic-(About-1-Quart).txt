Categories: Fish
Yield: 1 servings
3 c  Fish stock
1 c  Tomato juice
4    Envelopes unflavored
Gelatin
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
1 ts Sugar
2    Eggshells, crushed
2    Egg whites, lightly beaten
2 tb Cognac
In a saucepan combine the fish stock with the tomato juice, gelatin,
salt, pepper, sugar, egg shells and egg whites and heat slowly,
stirring constantly, until the mixture boils up in the pan.
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cognac.

set or becomes too firm it may be reheated, then brought to any
desired temperature.
