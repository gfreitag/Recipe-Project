Title: Chicken Breasts with Green Coriander (Cilantro)
Categories: Poultry, Main dish, British, Chicken
Yield: 2 servings
2    Boneless chicken breasts
1 bn Baby carrots
1 bn Coriander (cilantro)
2 tb Best quality olive oil
1 ts Lemon juice
Skin the chicken breasts and dust them with a little salt and pepper.
Lay each one on a square of baking parchment, flatten it lightly with
the palm of your hand and lay a sprig of coriander on top.  Fold the
sides of the paper over the meat, excluding as much air as possible,
and roll up to make a neat flat parcel.  Then overwrap carefully with
foil to make a waterproof package.  Trim and scrub the carrots.
Measure the olive oil into a small saucepan and add a seasoning of
salt and pepper.  Coarsely chop a tablespoon or two of coriander
leaves (a little less for beginners, a little more for addicts) and
reserve separately.  All these preparations can be done well ahead.

About 20 minutes before you plan to serve the dish, start cooking.
Steam the baby carrots.  Drop the chicken parcels, seam side up, into
a large pan of boiling water and cook for 13 to 18 minutes depending
on the size of the breasts.  Barely a bubble should disturb the
surface of the liquid while the chicken cooks.  Transfer the parcels,
still wrapped up, to a low oven for 5 minutes to let the meat set.

Blot the carrots dry and arrange them on a warmed serving dish.
Warm the olive oil.  Unwrap the chicken and add just 1 to 2
tablespoons of the juices to the pan of warming olive oil.  Quickly
carve the breasts into thin slices and arrange the meat beside the
carrots.  Add the lemon juice to the hot olive oil and immediately
pour the sizzling mixture over the chicken and carrots.  Scatter with
chopped coriander and serve straightway with hot crusty bread to mop
up the juices.
