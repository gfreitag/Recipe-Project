*Budwix is a mixture of millet, almonds and flax seed. You can use
plain yogurt or Quark cheese instead of cottage cheese. Other
seasonal fruits can be used instead of a banana. In a blender, grind
the grain-and-nut mixture until homogeneous but gritty. Add oil,
cottage cheese, lemon juice, honey and fruit to the mixture in the
blender. Blend until smooth and serve immediately.
