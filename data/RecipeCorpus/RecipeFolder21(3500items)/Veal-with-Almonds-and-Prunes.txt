hour, covered. Remove the foil and continue baking, basting
occasionally, until the veal is tender, about 1 more hour

Meanwhile, place the prunes in a saucepan and add the water,brown
sugar and 1/4 cup oil. Bring to a boil and simmer,covered 1/2 hour,
or until the prunes are tender. Keep warm. Before the meat is done,
heat the remaining 3/4 cup oil in a skillet and add the almonds.
Cook, stirring until they are golden brown. Drain on absorbent paper.

Slice the meat,put on a platter and keep hot. Drain the prunes,
arrange on a platter and scatter the almonds over them. Serve the
meat with the prunes and almonds as an accompaniment.

This is so easy that it is great for Passover and has gotten great
reviews prunes notwithstanding! Sandi in CT 03/01 01:00 P.M.
