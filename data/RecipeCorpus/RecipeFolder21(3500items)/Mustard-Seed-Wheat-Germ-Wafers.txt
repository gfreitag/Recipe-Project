Title: Mustard Seed-Wheat Germ Wafers
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 65 servings
1 c  Whole wheat flour
1 tb Whole mustard seeds
3/4 c  Toasted wheat germ
1/2 ts Salt
4 tb (1/2 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
1/2 c  Water
"This curious combination creates flavorful crackers with a unique
texture. As the basis of a light meal, they go well with cream cheese
and smoked fish. 350~F. 10 to 15 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.

In the food processor or in a large bowl, combine the flour, mustard
seeds, wheat germ, and salt. Cut in the butter until the mixture
resembles coarse meal. Mix in enough of the water to form a dough
that will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out into a rectangle 1/16 inch thick.
With a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or desired shapes.
Transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet. Prick each square 2 or 3
times, with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges.
Cool on a rack. Yield: 55-65.
