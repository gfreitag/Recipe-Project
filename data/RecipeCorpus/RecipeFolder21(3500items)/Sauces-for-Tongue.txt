3/4 pt Stock, pref. from tongue
1 lg Orange (juice only)
2 ts Lemon juice
1 tb Tarragon vinegar
3/4 oz Butter
2 tb Flour
Salt and pepper
4 tb Thick cream
MMMMM-----------------FOR PARSLEY & CAPER SAUCE----------------------

1 1/2 oz Capers

FOR SPICED KUMQUAT SAUCE: Slice and remove the pips from the
kumquats. Put them into a pan with the bay leaves, cloves, stock,
orange juice, lemon juice and tarragon vinegar. Bring very slowly to
the boil. Add a little salt and pepper, cover and set aside for 20
minutes to infuse. Strain, reserving the kumquats, liquid and spices
separately. Make a smooth sauce with the butter, flour and cooking
liquid. Return spices to the pan and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes.
Stir regularly to prevent sticking and to stop a skin from forming.
By the end of this time, the sauce should be the consistency of
cream; if necessary boil it hard for 2-3 minutes to reduce and
thicken it a little. Strain to extract the spices, stir in the cream,
then the kumquats. Reheat gently, adding a few pinches of ground
cloves, more lemon juice and other seasonings to taste.

FOR PARSLEY & CAPER SAUCE:  Crush the garlic clove with a little
salt. Then process it briefly with the chopped parsley, chives and
capers.  Add the lemon juice and zest, and the oil and whizz again
until the mixture is reduced to a thickened fragrant green puree.
Add a coarse grinding of black pepper and leave it for 1 hour or so
to allow the flavours to blend.
