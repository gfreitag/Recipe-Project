Title: Turkey or Chicken Tenders
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/4 lb Fresh turkey tenderloin
Or boneless chicken breast
1 1/4 c  Divided oat bran cereal
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Pepper
2 lg Egg whites
2 tb Lowfat evaporated milk
1 ts Paprika
1/2 c  Peanut oil
Cut turkey tenderloins or chicken breasts into 6 slices by cutting
across the turkey carefully with sharp knife. Pound tenders to 1/4
inch thickness. SLit around edges to keep from curling. Blend 1/2 cup
of the oat bran cereal with salt and pepper and coat tenders. Whip
egg whites lightly with milk. Blend remaining 3/4 cup oat bran with
paprika. Dip meat into egg whites, then into oat bran paprika
mixture. Place on baking rack and allow 5 minutes to dry. Heat peanut
oil in large frying pan until hot. Brown tenders 2-3 pieces at a time
for 3 minutes per side, or until crusty and brown. Drain well and
serve with a low-fat dip.
