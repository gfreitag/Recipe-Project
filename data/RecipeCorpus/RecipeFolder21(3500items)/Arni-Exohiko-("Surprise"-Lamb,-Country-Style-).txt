Title: Arni Exohiko ("Surprise" Lamb, Country Style )
Categories: Greek, Meat, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Olive oil
8    Loin lamb chops
18    Sheets commercial phyllo
6 tb Butter; hot and melted
2 c  Peas; cooked and drained
16    Potato balls; parboiled
16    Cherry tomatoes; peeled
1/2 lb Kasseri cheese; in 8 pieces
Salt & freshly ground pepper
3/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
1 pn Dried oregano
*Note: 3/4-inch slices leg of lamb may be used instead of lamb chops.

In a heavy skillet, heat the oil or butter and fry the lamb over high
heat, turning frequently.  Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes,
then remove from the heat.  Meanwhile, unroll the filo sheets and
cover with a damp towel.  In a small pan over low heat, have the
butter hot without letting it brown. Remove two sheets of filo, brush
with hot butter over the first, then cover with the second sheet and
brush it with butter.  In the center of the buttered filo place 1
lamb chop, 2 tablspoons peas, 2 potato balls, 2 cherry tomatoes, and
a slice of kasseri.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper, a heaping
tablespoon of parsley, and a pinch of oregano. Fold the filo around
the lamb and vegetables like a sealed parcel.  Place, seam side down,
on a buttered baking pan (approximately 11 x 15 x 3 inches) and set
aside while you repeat the procedure with the remaining ingredients
to make 8 "parcels".  Brush hot butter on the tops, then bake in a
moderate oven (350 F) for 45 to 50 minutes or until golden in color.
Remove from the oven and arrange on a warm platter or on individual
dishes. Serve warm, with a fresh-cooked or raw vegetable salad.

Note: The vegetables and herbs may be varied.  Substitute green beans
or lima beans for peas, use thyme or basil instead of oregano.  Arni
Exohiko is frequently prepared using buttered waxed paper, parchment
paper or aluminum foil rather than with filo.
