Title: Tofu Ribs
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM-----------------FORMATTED BY S. GRABOWSKI----------------------
1 lb Firm tofu
2 tb Cold pressed oil
8    Bamboo skewers
BBQ sauce as needed
1 c  Soy sauce (marinade)
Slice tofu 1/2" thin, marinade in soy sauce minimum 8 hours in fridge.
Pre-heat oven to 300F. Cut the marinated tofu slices lengthwise into 3
strips per slice. Brush the tofu slices on all sides with oil and lay
them, side by side, in a dish. The slices should not touch. Bake for
40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes.  Pass
bamboo skewers carefully through the width of each slice.  Five to
six slices will fit on one skewer without touching.  Cover with
barbecue sauce and pre-heat the broiler. Broil 6 inches from the heat
for about 5 minutes, turn over, and repeat. The tofu can become dark
but scorching will make it bitter.
