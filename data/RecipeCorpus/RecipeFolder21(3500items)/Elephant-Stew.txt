Title: Elephant Stew
Categories: Meat, Main dish, Cajun/creol
Yield: 1 servings
1    Elephant
2    Rabbits
Salt & pepper
Brown gravy
Cut elephant into bite sized pieces.  Cover with brown gravy.
Cook over low heat about 4 weeks.  This will serve 4,200 people.  If
more are expected, the 2 rabbits may be added, but do this only if
necessary, as most people do not like to find hare in their stew.
