1 ts Grated fresh ginger
1 1/2 tb Ground cumin seeds
1 1/2 tb Ground coriander seeds
1 1/2 ts Cinnamon

2 ea Firm, tart apples, cored &
-- cubed
1/2 ea Red bell pepper
1 c  Chopped dried apricots
1/2 c  Raisins

Fresh lemon juice
Saute the onions in the peanut oil for 10 minutes.  Stir in the
garlic, ginger & curry spices & continue to saute, stirring
constantly for 3 minutes.

Add the zucchini & water & stir well so that the spices won't stick
to the pot.  Cover & simmer for 10 minutes.  Mix in the green beans,
apple, peppers & dried apricots.  Simmer gently, covered for about 30
minutes. Stir occasionally & add a little more water if needed to
prevent sticking. When the fruit & vegetables are quite tender, stir
in the raisins, the conserve & the lemon juice.  Taste & adjust to
your liking if necessary. If you need it to be more spicy, add more
cayenne or garam masala.  If you want it sweeter, add more conserve.
Tarter, add more lemon juice.

Serve on a bed of rice, topped with nuts & banana.
