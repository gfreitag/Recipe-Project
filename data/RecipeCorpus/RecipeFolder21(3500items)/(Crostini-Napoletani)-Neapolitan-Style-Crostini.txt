Title: (Crostini Napoletani) Neapolitan-Style Crostini
Categories: Italian, Appetizer
Yield: 16 servings
16    Slices of Italian bread,
Cut 1/2-inch thick
1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
1/3 c  Black or green olivada* OR
1/3 c  (4 oz.) Calamata olives,
Pitted or finely chopped
1/2 lb Fresh mozzarella cheese,
Cut in 14 1/4-inch slices
1/2 lb Plum tomatoes, cut
Lengthwise into 16 1/4-inch
Slices
1/8 ts Salt
1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1.  Preheat the oven to 400F.  Brush one side of the bread slices
with some of the olive oil and arrange on a baking sheet oiled side
up. Bake until lightly browned and crusty, about 4 minutes. 2. Spread
the olivada or chopped olives on each toast, cover each with a slice
of mozzarella and top with a slice of tomato.  Brush the tomatoes
with the remaining oil and sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Bake
until the cheese is melted, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Serve at once.

* Olivada is a puree of black or green olives packed in oil that is
sold at specialty food stores.  You can substitute tapenade or make
your own. (Note from me:  We have a batch of pesto in the
refrigerator so I plan to use it instead of the olivada.)  I also
plan to use Creole or homegrown tomatoes.
