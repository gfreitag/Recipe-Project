Title: London Broil with Hunter's Sauce
Categories: Beef, Salsa/sauce, Meat
Yield: 4 servings
2 lb Flank steak
2 tb Peanut oil
Salt and pepper
3 tb Butter
Hunter's sauce for serving
3 tb Parsley, chopped
1. Preheat a broiler rack with the broiler set on high. 2. Rub the
flank steak on both sides with oil and salt and pepper. Use generous
amount of black pepper. 3. Place the meat on the broiler rack, and
let cook about 4-5 in. from the source of the heat. Broil about 3-5
min. and turn the meat. Broil on the other side 3-5 min. Cooking time
will depend on the desired degree of doneness. 4. Transfer the steak
to warmed serving platter and dot with butter. Let the steak stand in
a warm place about 5 min. to redistribute the internal juices of the
meat. 5. Juices will accumulate around the steak as it stands. Add
these to the hunter's sauce. Sprinkle the meat with chopped parsley
and carve it on the diagonal. Serve with the sauce.

For hunter's sauce, the quickest way is to take some mushrooms and
slice them thin. Then saute in a tbsp of butter. Once done add to a
can of brown gravy or a brown sauce and a few black peppercorns.
