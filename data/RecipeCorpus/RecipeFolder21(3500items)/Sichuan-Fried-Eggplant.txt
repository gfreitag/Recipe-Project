them.

For the batter mix the flour, water, and salt together in a small
bowl, then strain through a fine sieve.  Let rest for about 20
minutes.

For the sauce, heat a wok or large frying-pan until hot and add the 1
tablespoon of oil.  Put in the scallions, ginger, and chili bean
sauce and stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Then add the stock, rice wine,
vinegar, tomato paste, sugar, and soy sauce and continue to cook for
1 minute.  Thicken the sauce with the blended cornstarch and cook
another minute.  Set aside.

Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer or large wok until quite hot.  Dip
the slices of eggplant into the batter, let the excess batter drip
off, then deep-fry.  You may have to do this in several batches.
Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain well on paper
towel.

Arrange the eggplant slices on a serving platter, pour the sauce over
and serve.
