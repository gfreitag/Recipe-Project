Contributed to the echo by: Frank Damiano Pork Roast Stuffed With
Sausage And Spinach Lay pork roast out flat, fat side down, and
decide whether you can fill it like a jelly roll or whether you must
cut some of the meat from the center so that you have room for the
stuffing. <If you have to remove some meat dice and mix with sausage
meat.>

Wash,chop and quickly fry the spinach in olive oil. Drain. <If you use
frozen spinach, defrost, drain and squeeze it dry before frying.>

Salt and pepper the meat. Place the sausage, spinach, eggs, cheese and
onion in the center of the roast. Roll up the roast, and tie it like a
jelly-roll. Place it on a baking rack, and bake at 350-Degree for
about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until golden on the outside.
