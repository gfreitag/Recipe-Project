encorporating potato and flour with it. Mix with hands into a ball
and add more flour to until dough is not sticky. Place dough on the
side on a floured surface. Clean and flour surface well. Cut a piece
of dough off and roll into a long snake-like form. (about 1 inch
around. Cut into 1 inch pieces and pus aside onto floured surface
again to prevent sticking to board or to each other. When all pieces
are cut, make grooves by gently rollin the off the grating side of a
cheese grater at the same time making an indentation with the thumb,
They need not be perfect, just enough groove to hold some sauce. Have
a very large pot of salted water boiling. Place half of the gnocchi

slotted strainer and place in serving bowl with sauce of your choice.
