Contributed to the echo by: Michelle Bass Chef Joe Cahn of The New
Orleans School of Cooking and Louisiana General Store heard about
this echo and gave my sister some recipes for me to post. I thought
y'all might like this praline recipe, as I haven't seen one on here.
PRALINES 1. Combine all ingredients except vanilla and bring to a
boil. (Note: To roast pecans, bake them on a sheet pan at 350 degrees
for 20-25 minutes, until slightly browned and smell permeates.)

2. Cook to soft ball stage (238-240 degrees), stirring constantly.

3. Remove from heat, and add vanilla. Stir to cool until mixture
thickens, becomes creamy and cloudy, and pecans stay suspended in
mixture.

4. Spoon out on buttered wax paper, aluminum foil or parchment paper.

Makes 1-50 (!!) pralines, depending on size. When using wax paper, be
sure to buffer with newspaper, as hot wax will transfer onto whatever
is beneath it.

He also gave me a history of Pralines if anyone is interested.

P.S. The New Orleans School of Cooking is a great place for visitors
to go. Joe Cahn conducts a great cooking class (classics like bread
pudding, gumbo, jambalaya, etc) which includes a lot of his humor.
You then get to eat what he cooked. It's reasonably priced and I've
never heard from a disappointed "attendee".
