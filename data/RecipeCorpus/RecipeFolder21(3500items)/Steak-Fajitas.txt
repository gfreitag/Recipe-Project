Contributed to the echo by: Debra Heng STEAK FAJITAS Saute onion and
chilies until softened. Add green peppercorns and wine; reduce until
most of wine is evaporated to a syrup consistency. Add cream and
continue to simmer until sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon. Don't
let it get pasty, though; watch carefully. Lower heat, salt to taste.
Add more butter if necessary. Toss in cilantro or parsley. Add beef
and stir just to coat if freshly grilled; if leftover, heat just 'til
warm.

Spoon into tortillas. Add fresh chopped tomato or salsa, guacamole,
sour cream, shredded lettuce and cheddar. Fold up like a burrito and
enjoy!
