minuters or until onions become clear.  Add celery and garlic, saute
1 minute.  Add water, 1 cup at a time, stirring well until desired
consistency is reached.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Drop in bay
leaf.  Add remainder of water and bring to boil.  Reduce heat
immediately.  Cover and simmer for 20 min. or until gravy thickens.
Add crabs and simmer for 15 min. more.  Add crab fat and parsley and

cooked, and season gravy.  The desired taste appears and matures
during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Cook rice accorting to
directions.
