TREE ORNAMENTS: Cut plastic wrap into 6-inch squares.  Gather corners
and twist tightly.  Secure with pipe cleaner.  Cluster individual
balls into one large one, connecting each ball with the adjoining
pipe cleaner.  Tie "curling" ribbon around the cluster to form a loop
at the tops.  Tie two 10-inch strands of ribbon at the bottom and
curl.  Hang on the tree with the loop ends.

M&M CANDY WREATH: Make cluster balls the same way as the candy tree
ornament clusters, using plain or peanut M&M's.  Form a circle from a
wire coat hanger, the hook forms the hanging loop.  Attach cluster
balls to the hanger with pipe cleaners.  Tie a large bow at the top
of the wreatn.
