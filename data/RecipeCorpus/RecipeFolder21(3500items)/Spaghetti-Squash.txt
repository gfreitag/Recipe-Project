Title: Spaghetti Squash
Categories: Italian, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1    Spaghetti squash, 1 1/2
To 2 lbs.
1 c  Grated Cheddar cheese
1 c  Grated Mozzarella cheese
1 1/2 c  Grated zucchini or diced
Green pepper
2 c  Tomato sauce
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Garlic powder
1/2 ts Salt (or less)
Dash of pepper
1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
Cut squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out seeds. Place squash, cut side
down, in 2" simmering water; cover and cook 15 minutes. (Now call the
kids to watch!) Holding the hot squash in a potholder, run the tines
of a fork across its pulp-and like magic, there is your spagetti! Mix
the strands with the cheeses, zucchini or peppers, sauce, oregano,
garlic, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Scoop back into squash
shells, top with Parmesan, and bake at 350 for 20 minutes.
