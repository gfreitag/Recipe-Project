Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM-----------------------CHEESE FILLING----------------------------
1/2 lb Fresh mozzarella cheese,
1/2-inch dice
2 lb Ricotta cheese (or 2
15-ounce containers)
1/4 lb Prosciutto, 1/4-inch dice
2    Eggs
1/2 c  Freshly graterd Parmesan
Cheese
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
1/4 c  Minced fresh parsley
14    Manicotti shells
3 c  Tomato sauce (Meat or
Marinara)
1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
Cheese
TO MAKE THE FILLING:  combine all the filling ingredients and
mix very thoroughly.
Heat 4 to 6 quarts of salted water to the boil in a large pot;
add 2 tablespoons oil to help prevent pasta from sticking.  Add half
of the manicotti and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or until not quite al
dente. Stir occasionally with a long-handled fork.  Hold a strainer
over the pot and use a slotted spoon to remove 1 or 2 manicotti at a
time from the boiling water, placing them in the strainer.  Shake
manicotti free of water over the pot.  Spread a clean kitchen towel
on the kitchen counter. Place the manicotti side by side on the
towel, which will absorb all the remaining moisture.  (The shells
must be completely dry before stuffing.) Repeat until all shells are
cooked.  Cool.  Generously butter a baking dish, 13 x 10 inches.
Fill each shell with some of the stuffing, letting a little of the
stuffing come out on either end.  This is best done with a pastry
tube and a large nozzle; otherwisew use a regular teaspoon. Lay the
stuffed manicotti side by side in the buttered dish and surround them
with any manicotti shells you may not have sufficient stuffing for.
Pour half the tomato sauce over the shells and sprinkle with 1/2 cup
Parmesan cheese. Bake in a preheated moderate oven for 15 to 20
minutes. Heat remaining tomato sauce to serve separately.  Serve with
additional Parmesan Cheese.
