6    Egg whites-
Keep at room temperature
For at least 1 hour
6    Egg yolks
3/4 c  Sugar
1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa
2 ts Vanilla ***
Dash salt
MMMMM-----------------------------F----------------------------------
1 1/2 c  Heavy cream, chilled
1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar*****
1/4 c  Unsweetened cocoa
2 ts Instant coffee
1 ts Vanilla***
Grease the bottom of a 15 1/2x10 1/2x1" jelly-roll pan; line with
waxed paper, grease lightly.   Preheat oven to 375 In a large bowl of
an electric mixer beat egg whites at high speed until soft peaks form
when beaters are slowly raised. Add 1/4 cup sugar, 2 T at a time,
beating until stiff peaks form when beater is slowly raised. With
same beaters beat yolks at high speed, adding the remaining 1/2 cup
of sugar 2 T at a time, until mixture is very thick-about 4 minutes.
At low speed beat in cocoa, vanilla and salt just until >> smooth.
With wire whisk or rubber scraper using and under and over motion,
gently fold the cocoa mixture into the beaten egg whites, just until
they are blended(no egg white should show). Spread evenly in the pan,

Bake 15 minutes, just until the surface springs back when gently
pressed with fingertip. Sift confectioner's sugar in a 15x10"
rectangle, on a clean linen towel. Turn cake out onto sugar, lift off
pan, peel paper off of cake. Roll up cake jelly-roll fashion, towel
and all, starting at the short end.

Cool completely on rack, seam side down- at least 30 minutes. To make
the filling: Combine filling ingredients in medium bowl. Beat using
an electric mixer until thick and then refrigerate. Unroll cake,
spread with fillin to 1" from the edge, reroll/ Refrigerate 1 hour
before serving. To serve sprinkle with confectioner's sugar. You may
make this cake a week ahead, then freeze it wrapped in foil. Let
stand at room temperature for 1 hour before serving.

*** Pure vanilla has alcohol and therefore is not Kosher for Passover.
Either leave it out or find vanilla without the alcohol. *****
Confectioner's sugar has cornstarch and so is not Kosher for Passover,
someone posted a recipe for making confectioner's sugar by using
potato starch instead of cornstarch. I did not get the exact
directions, but I think if you backdate you will find it in one of
the dessert recipes.
