Pat fish dry w. paper towels. Mix salt, ginger & pepper. Coat both
sides of fish with mixture and rub 1 tsp. cornstarch on both sides of
fish. Cover & refrigerate 30 minutes.

Place black beans in bowl and cover with warm water. Stir about 2
minutes. Remove and drain. Discard water. Partially pulverize beans.
Chinese cooks use the back end of their cleaver handle.

Cut 3 of green onions on diagonal into 1 inch pieces, remaining one
into thin slices (strings).

Remove seeds and membranes from chilies. Cut chilies into very thin
slices.

Mix 1 Tbs cornstarch, water and sugar.

[If grilled fish is preferred, grill on charcoal about 4-5 minutes
each side or 10 minutes per inch of thickness, not too close to coals
~ otherwise fry in wok]

Heat wok until hot & add 2 Tbs oil, tilting to coat sides. Fry fish 2
minutes or until brown, turning once. Reduce heat to low, cover and
simmer 10 minutes turning after 3 minutes. Uncover & remove from wok.

Bring wok back up to very hot over high heat. Add 1 Tbs oil, tilt &
coat. Add black beans, chilies, garlic & green onion pieces & stir
fry all for 1 minute. Add broth/stock and heat to boiling. Stir in
cornstarch/sugar water mixture, stir cooking until thickened. Add
fish steaks turning to coat with sauce. Heat 2 minutes.

Line platter with spinach/lettuce leaves, place fish on bed and
