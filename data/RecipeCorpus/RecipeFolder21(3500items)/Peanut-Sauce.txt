Title: Peanut Sauce
Categories: Thai, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
Vegetable oil
-- for deep-frying
4 oz Whole shelled peanuts
1 sl Terasi*
2    Shallots; peeled and chopped
1    Garlic clove
-- peeled and chopped
Salt
1/2 ts Chilli powder
-OR- sambal ulek*
1/2 ts Brown sugar
14 fl Water
1 oz Creamed coconut* (optional)
1 tb Lemon juice
Method: ======= To make the sauce: Heat the oil in a wok or deep
frying pan (deep-fat fryer) and fry the peanuts for 5 to 6 minutes.
Drain thoroughly on kitchen paper towels. Allow to cool, then work to
a fine powder in an electric grinder, or with a pestle and mortar.

Put the terasi, shallots and garlic, if using, in a cobek or mortar.
Pound to a very smooth paste, then add a little salt.  Heat 1
tablespoon vegetable oil in a pan, add the paste and fry for 1
minute, stirring constantly.  Add the chili powder or sambal ulek,
sugar and water, bring to the boil, then add the ground peanuts.
Stir well, then simmer until thick, stirring occasionally.  Add the
creamed coconut (santen) if using, and stir until dissolved.  Keep
hot.

Note: ===== This really isn't as time-consuming as it sounds,
providing you use roasted peanuts (avoiding the deep-frying step),
and get your terasi, sambal ulek and coconut milk from the nearest
Asian market.  I must have had a lot of time on my hands the first
time I made this, as I decided to eschew the grinder and use a mortar
and pestle.

*terasi [Malaysia] Also known as balachan/blacan (Malaysia), kapi
(Thailand) and ngapi (Burma).  A kind of pungent shrimp paste, used
in very small quantities.  Depending on the recipe in which it is
used, it can be crushed with spices to make a paste which is then
sauteed in oil. Alternatively, it may be grilled (broiled) or fried
first, then added to other ingredients.

*sambal ulek [Indonesia]  Used as an accompaniment and in cooking.
Made by crushing fresh red chillis with a little salt: Remove the
seeds from the chillis, chop finely, then crush with salt using a
pestle and mortar. Three chillis will make about 1 tablespoon sambal
ulek. also available redy-prepared in small jars from Oriental stores
and some delicatessens.

*santen [Malaysia] see coconut milk.

Coconut milk [India/Malaysia/Thailand/Vietnam]  Known as narial ka
dooth in India, santen in Indonesia and Malaysia.  Best made from
fresh coconuts: Grate the flesh of 1 coconut into a bowl, pour on 600
ml/1 pint/2-1/2 cups boiling water, then leave to stand for about 30
minutes. Squeeze the flesh, then strain before using. This quantitiy
will make a thick coconut milk, add more or less water as required.
Desiccated (shredded) coconut can be used instead of fresh coconut:
Use 350g/12 oz./4 cups to 600 ml/1 pint/2-1/2 cups boiling water. Use
freshly made coconut milk within 24 hours. Canned coconut milk is
also available.
