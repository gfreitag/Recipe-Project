Title: Seitan a la Normandie
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
4 c  Sliced onions
2 tb Minced garlic
2 tb Sesame oil
-OR- other cooking oil
4    Pieces of seitan, 2 oz each
- fried and simmered
-(SEE NOTE IN DIRECTIONS)
6 tb Tamari
4 tb Apple juice concentrate
1 c  -Water
1/2 c  Ground, roasted pecan nuts
-(Optional; this dish is
- more delicate without it)
3 md Apples; peeled, cored,
- and thinly sliced
2 tb Mirin or calvados or sherry
NOTE: This recipe needs uncooked seitan.  Cut the seitan into four
thin pieces (1/8 to 1/4 inch thick), each about 2 ounces.  The
thinner the better.  Fry the seitan in a (little?) hot oil until
lightly browned and then simmer it in a little water for about 30
minutes before using.  If you don't simmer it first, you may need to
add more liquid to the recipe.

Saute the onions and garlic in the oil until the onions are soft and
translucent but not fully cooked.

Place the seitan in an ovenproof baking dish and cover it with tamari,
apple juice concentrate, and water.  Cover with the sauteed onion
mixture and sprinkle the ground pecans over it, if you wish.  Fan the
apples over the onions and pour the mirin on top.  Cover the dish
with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil, and bake at 300 degrees F
for 2 hours.  Serve hot.
