"This fine stir-fry will make fans out of people who are ho-hum about
cabbage. This recipe is from Madhur Jaffray's Cookbook, _Food for
Family and Friends_.
Remove coarse outer leaves from cabbage, quarter and core. Cut into
fine fine shred, either by hand or with food processor. Set aside.
Peel onions; cut in half lengthwise. Cut crosswise into thin half
rings; set aside.
In large wok or large wide pot over medium heat, heat oil. When
very hot, add the cumin and the fennel seeds. As soon as the seeds
turn a shade darker (just a few minutes) toss in the sesame seeds.
Stir for a second before adding onions. Stir fry 2 or 3 minutes or
'til browned on the edges. Cover tightly and turn heat to low. Cook
2-3 minutes or 'til cabbage wilts. Uncover and cook over high heat,
stir fry 5 minutes or 'til vegetables are very tender. SERVES: 6
