Title: Angelica Tartlets
Categories: Dessert, Pie/tart, British
Yield: 1 servings
2 oz Home-candied angelica
1    Shortcrust pastry *
1 1/2 oz Butter
1 1/2 tb Honey
1/2 c  Curd cheese
1    Egg yolk; mixed with:
1 ts Milk
1    Egg white
*Note: Shortcrust pastry made with 7-8 oz flour will be about right
for this recipe.

These tarts are irresistible when made with home-candied angelica, as
dull as ditchwater when store-bought is used.  Chop the angelica into
small pieces, cover with warm water to rinse off some of the sugar
and set aside for a few minutes.  While the angelica soaks, line 18 x
2 1/2 inch tartlet tins with the shortcrust pastry and start
preparing the filling.  Dice and barely melt the butter in a small
saucepan.  Away from the heat, beat in the honey, then the curd
cheese, then the egg yolk mixed with the milk. Stir in the well
drained angelica.  Whisk the egg white to snowy peaks and fold it in.
Spoon the mixture into the pastry-lined tartlet tins and bake at 400
F (200 C) gas mark 6 for 30 minutes until puffed up and golden. Serve
as soon as cooled from cooking.
