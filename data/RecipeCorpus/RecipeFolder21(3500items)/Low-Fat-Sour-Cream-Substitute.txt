Title: Low-Fat Sour Cream Substitute
Categories: Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
1 oz Container lowfat cottage
Cheese
2 tb Buttermilk
1 ts Lemon juice
Contributed to the echo by: Randall Chrisman This is something that a
friend of mine learned in her efforts to cut down on the amount of
fat in her diet. Seems she and her husband were quite fond of sour
cream (being the kind of people that would toss it onto the potato
and not stop until you couldn't see the potato!) This is a really
great substitute for the topping...such to the point that I'm not
fond of sour cream anymore. Optional:

Schilling Cheese Sauce Mix Hidden Valley Reduced Calorie Ranch

Mix the Hidden Valley Blue Cheese Dressing MIX. Dump the cottage
cheese, buttermilk and lemon juice into a food processor with metal
blade. Process until smooth (and I mean SMOOTH...can turn grainy
unless you give it time...when you think it's done, process it some
more.) When it's done, you have the option of blending in any of the
powdered dressing mixes (we use 3/4 package for flavor - more than
that and you've reduced your fat intake and TRIPLED your sodium
intake.) You need to pour the contents back into the cottage cheese
container and let it set for an hour or so.
