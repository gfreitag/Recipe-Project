Title: Roasted Peppers with Mozzarella and Caramelized Garlic
Categories: Italian, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
4 md Yellow and red bell peppers
2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
18    Garlic cloves, sliced
1/4 c  Plus 1-1/2 teaspoons
Balsamic vinegar
2    Sprigs of fresh thyme OR
1/4 ts Dried
6 oz Fresh mozzarella cheese,
Sliced as thin as possible
1/4 c  Coarsely chopped flat-leaf
Parsley or fresh basil
Freshly ground black pepper
1.  Roast the bell peppers directly over a gas flame or under the
broiler as close to the heat as possible, turning, until charred all
over, about 5 minutes.  Enclose the peppers in a paper bag and set
aside for 10 minutes to steam.  With a small knife, scrape off the
blackened skin; remove the cores, seeds and ribs.  Rinse under
running water. Slice the peppers lengthwise into 1-inch strips.  (The
recipe can be prepared to this point up to 3 days ahead; cover and
refrigerate.) 2. In a small nonreactive skillet, combine the olive
oil and garlic. Cover and cook over very low heat until the garlic is
very tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Uncover the pan, increase the heat to
moderate and cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in the vinegar
and thyme and cook for 1 minute. 3. To assemble, decoratively arrange
the pepper strips and mozzarella slices on 6 small plates.  Spoon the
caramelized garlic dressing over the peppers and cheese and sprinkle
the parsley and black pepper on top. Serve at room temperature.  (The
salad can be assembled up to 2 hours before serving.)
