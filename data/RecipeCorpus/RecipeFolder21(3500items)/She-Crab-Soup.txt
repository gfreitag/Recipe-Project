This is a very old and secretive South Carolina recipe that
originated in Charleston, SC., a city much like that of the history
of New Orleans. The recipe has never before been given out from the
original family of the restaurant first making this dish.  Over the
years, othe restaurants have come up with a good likeness of it, but
not the original.  Here is the original.
