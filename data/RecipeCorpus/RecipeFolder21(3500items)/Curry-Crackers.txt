Yield: 95 servings

1 1/2 tb Very finely minced onion
1 ts Pressed garlic (about 4
Medium cloves)
3/4 ts Very finely minced fresh
Ginger OR
1/4 ts Ground dried ginger
1 1/2 ts Ground dried cumin

2 c  All-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Water
"The flavors of traditional curry spices are accentuated and subtly
blended by sauteing them in butter before mixing with the other
ingredients. The result is an exotic cracker that makes superb buffet
fare. Turmeric lends a brilliant, beautiful yellow color. These fire
crackers are good with a mild, yogurt-based dip. 325~F. 20 to 25
minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.

Melt the butter over medium heat in a small frying pan. Add the onion,
garlic, and ginger (if using fresh ginger) and saute until the onion
is translucent. Add the cumin, corinder, turmeric, and cayenne (and,
if using it, the ground dried ginger) and stir well over medium heat
for about 1 minute.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, stir together the flour and
salt. Add the spice mixture and blend very well until the mixture
resembles coarse meal and is a bright yellow color. Slowly add the
water and blend until the dough will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or
pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/16 to 1/8 inch. With a sharp knife, cut
into 2-inch squares or other shapes. Prick each one 2 or 3 times with
the tines of a fork.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until crisp. Cool on a rack. Yield: 85-95.

VARIATIONS: If necessary, substitute 2 Tablespoons "curry powder,"
for the cumin, turmeric, coriander, and cayenne. Curry powder is
simply a commercial blend of various spices. For a spicier cracker,
increase the amount of cumin, corinader, and turmeric to 2 teaspoons
each. And for a more fiery cracker, increase the amount of cayenne.
