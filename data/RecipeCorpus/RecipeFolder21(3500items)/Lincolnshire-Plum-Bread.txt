Title: Lincolnshire Plum Bread
Categories: Bread, British
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Strong white bread flour
1/4 oz Easy-blend yeast
1 ts Ground cinnamon
1 ts Ground allspice
4 tb Sugar
1 pn Salt
2    Eggs; lightly beaten
1/4 lb Butter; melted
8 tb Milk; warm
1/2 lb Prunes; cut into
- sultana-size pieces
2 oz Currants
2 oz Sultanas
Using a food-mixer or processor or your hands, mix and knead all the
ingredients except the dried fruits to a smooth and elastic dough.
Cover and leave to rise until doubled in size - about 1 hour in a
warm room.

Knock back the risen dough and knead again briefly, gradually
working in the dried fruits until evenly distributed.  Divide the
dough in two, shape and put into two small (1 lb) greased and lined
loaf tins.  Cover and leave to prove (rise) until puffy and light.

Bake on a preheated baking sheet at 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5 for
40-50 minutes.  Take the loaves out of the tins and return them to
the oven for a further 10 minutes or so as necessary - the bread will
sound hollow when tapped on the base if it is properly cooked.  Makes
2 small loaves.
