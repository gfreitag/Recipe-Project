Title: Rack of Lamb with Bacon Vinaigrette
Categories: Meat
Yield: 6 servings
2    Trimmed lamb racks
- 8 ribs each
1/4 c  Olive oil
2/3 c  Red wine vinegar
1 ts Minced garlic
1 ts Ground coriander
1 ts Kosher salt
1 ts Ground black pepper
1/2 lb Bacon; cut in 3/4-in pieces
1/2 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
1 tb Dijon mustard
HAVE YOUR BUTCHER TRIM the racks, exposing the bone. Remove the outer
layer of fat and discard. Lay the racks in a glass dish and sprinkle
with 1 tablespoon oil, 1/4 cup vinegar, garlic, coriander, salt and
pepper. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour. Preheat
oven to 450F. Pat racks dry and place fat side up in a roasting pan.
Place in oven for 10 minutes, reduce heat to 350F and continue to
roast another 15 minutes for medium rare, 18 to 20 minutes for
medium. Meanwhile, place the bacon in a 10-inch skillet over medium
heat and cook 3 to 4 minutes. Set the skillet aside. Remove the lamb
from the oven and pour out the fat. Add chicken broth and stir to
dissolve and scrape up any brown bits that have stuck to the bottom
of the pan. Pour liquid into the skillet with the bacon. When it's
time to put dinner on the table, cut the racks into chops and arrange
them on a platter. Pour any juices from the lamb into the saucepan.
Place the skillet over high heat, bring to a boil and add the
mustard. Remove from the heat, beat in the rest of the oil and pour
the sauce over the lamb.
