Title: Beef Jerky a la Willie
Categories: Beef, Snack
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Lo salt soy sauce
1 1/4 ts Onion powder
1/3 c  Worcestershire Sauce
1 1/4 ts Garlic powder
2 1/3 ts Pepper
2 tb Brown sugar
1 lb Lean beef
Liquid mesquite smoke *
* use in place of smoker.

Mix all ingredients except beef to make marinade.  Cut thinly sliced
beef into 1/2 inch strips and marinate for 8 to 12 hours. Smoke using
mesquite chips for about three hours and then finish drying in oven.
If doing whole operation in oven use liquid smoke and hang strips of
beef on highest rack and put shallow pan underneath to catch
drippings. Turn oven on and set to lowest possible setting and leave
for 6 to 8 hours until thoroughly dried. A couple of hints that I
picked up from one of the cooking echos. Use toothpicks or wooden
skewers to hang meat by, and put a couple of layers of paper towels
in the pan to collect the drippings and save cleaning problems later
on.
