MMMMM--------------------------ROULADE-------------------------------
1/4 c  (1/2 stick) unsalted
Butter
1/3 c  Unsifted all purpose

1 1/3 c  Warmed milk
1/4 ts Pepper
6    Separated eggs
1 1/4 c  Grated parmesan cheese
1    Egg white
FILLING: Saute onion in oil in large skillet, stirring often, until
soft and golden, about 8 minutes. Add red pepper and cook 4 minutes
longer. Add spinach, lemon rind, salt, sugar and pepper. Transfer to
medium size bowl. Stir in ricotta cheese. Set aside. Preheat oven to
400 degrees. Grease bottom of 15.5 x 10.5 inch jelly roll pan. Line
bottom withw ax paper; grease and lightly flour paper, tapping out
any excess flour. Set aside. ROULADE: Melt butter in heavy saucepan
over low heat. Stir in flour. Cook, stirring, until mixture is smooth
and lightly colored. Gradually whisk in warm milk. Cook, stirring,
over medium heat until mixture is quite thick, 4-5 minutes. Stir in
pepper. Remove from heat. Beat egg yolks, one at a time, into milk
mixture. Stir in 3/4 cup of the parmesan cheese. Transfer mixture to
large bowl. Beat the egg whites in a large bowl until stiff peaks
form. Carefully fold into the milk mixture. Spoon into the prepared
pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Sprinkle evenly with the
remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake roulade in preheated hot oven for 15
minutes or until golden and cake tester inserted into center comes
out clean. Carefully invert onto kitchen towel or wax paper. Remove
the wax paper from the top of the roulade. Starting with a long side,
roll up the roulade and towel together. Place the roll, seam-side
down, on wire rack. Cool at room temperature 20 minutes. Unroll the
roulade and remove the towel. Spread spinach filling down the length
of the roulade, leaving a 2 inch border on one long side and a 1 inch
border on each short end roll. Roll up, jelly-roll fashion, from the
long side without a border. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and
refrigerate. Unwrap to serve chilled or at room temperature. Cut
crosswise into slices.
