Title: Thai Fresh Cucumber Salad (Taeng Kwa Brio Wan)
Categories: Salad, Vegetarian, Thai
Yield: 6 servings
3 md Cucumbers; sliced as thinly
-- as possible *
Salt
1/2 ts Dried hot pepper flakes
1 tb Sugar; dissolved in:
1/4 c  -Hot water
4 tb White vinegar
2 tb Minced red onion; -OR-
1 tb -Minced scallions   (Opt.)
*Note: The book says to peel the cucumbers only if they are waxed and
even then leave on a few strips.  I say to remove all the peel if
it's been waxed.  Yuck.

In a bowl, generously salt the sliced cucumbers.  Allow to sit for at
least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Combine the other ingredients.

Squeeze out as much of the cucumber juice as you can, by wringing a
handful at a time in a double layer of cheesecloth or a dish towel.
Twist until you can extract no more juice.

Combine the squeezed cucumbers and the sauce in a serving bowl and
refrigerate until ready to serve.
