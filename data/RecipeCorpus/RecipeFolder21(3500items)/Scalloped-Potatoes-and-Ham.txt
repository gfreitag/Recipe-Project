Slice potatoes and layer with onions and ham in a large casserole. (I
cook onions in butter or oil first.) Melt butter, add flour and cook
until smooth and bubbly. Remove from heat, stir in milk, and reheat
to boiling, whisking constantly. Cook 3 minutes. Add cheese one cup
at a time until it melts. Add remaining ingredients. Pour over ham
mixture and bake at 350 degrees for 45 to 60 minutes, until potatoes
are done and top is browned.

Makes 4 servings.
