Title: Vegetable Pullao
Categories: Vegetarian, Indian, Side dish
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Whole mung bean
-- picked over and washed
2 c  Long-grain rice
4 1/2 tb Vegetable oil
1 ts Whole black mustard seeds
1 md Onion
-- peeled and finely chopped
4 md Garlic cloves
-- peeled and finely minced
1 ts Peeled, minced ginger
1/3 lb String beans; trimmed
-- and cut into 1/4" pieces
2 ts Garam masala
1 1/2 ts Ground coriander
2 1/2 ts Salt
2 tb Finely minced parsley
-- preferably Chinese
Put mung beans in a bowl with 3 cups water.  Cover lightly and set
aside for 12 hours.  Drain beans and wrap in a very damp dish towel.
Put the wrapped bundle in a bowl.  Put this bowl in a dark place
(like an unused oven) for 24 hours.

Wash rice well and soak in 4 cups of water for half an hour.  Drain
well.

Preheat oven to 325 F.

Heat oil in a wide, heavy, 4- to 5-quart ovenproof pot over a
medium-high flame.  When hot, put in mustard seeds.  As soon as the
mustard seeds begin to pop (this takes just a few seconds), put in
the onion.  Stir and fry for about 5 minutes or until onion turns
brown at the edges.  Add the garlic and ginger.  Fry, stirring, for
about 1 minute.  Turn heat to medium-low and add the mung beans,
rice, string beans, mushrooms, garam masala, ground coriander, and
salt.  Stir and saute for about 10 minutes or until rice turns
translucent and vegetables are well coated with oil. Add 4 cups hot
water and the minced parsley.  Turn heat to a medium-high flame and
cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until most of the water is
absorbed. (There will be an inch or so of water at the bottom.)
Cover the pot first with aluminum foil, crimping and sealing the
edges, and then with its own lid.  Place in heated oven for half an
hour.  Fluff up with a fork and serve.
