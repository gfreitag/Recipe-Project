Title: Cottagers' Meatloaf
Categories: Meat, British
Yield: 8 servings
1 1/8 lb Lean belly pork *
3/4 lb Pig's liver
6 oz Lean green streaky bacon
6 oz Grated carrot
6 oz Fresh brown breadcrumbs
2 sm Onions
1 lg Green pepper
Fresh chopped parsley
1    Garlic clove; crushed w/salt
4 ts Lemon juice
1 ts Lemon zest
1/4 ts (generous) dried thyme
1/4 ts (generous) dried marjoram
*Note: Weight of pork is after trimming away bones, rind and excess
fat.

Mince the meats fairly finely, grate the carrot and chop the onion and
green pepper very finely.  Mix all the ingredients very thoroughly
with your hands and season well with salt and pepper.  Fry a small
nugget to check seasoning and adjust to taste.  Oil a 2 lb loaf tin,
line with greaseproof paper and oil again.  Pack the mixture into the
tin.  Press it down well, dome the top of the meat nicely and press 2
or 3 bay leaves on top.

Cover the tin with foil.  Stand it in a roasting pan and pour in
enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the loaf tin.
Bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for 1 hour.  Reduce temperature to
325 F (160 C) gas mark 3, remove foil lid and bake for a further 30
minutes.

Cool the cooked meatloaf for 30 minutes, then tilt the tin and pour
off the juices.  Set aside in a cold place overnight before serving
to allow flavours to blend and mature.
