Title: Gingered Tofu Peanut Spread
Categories: Sandwich, Salsa/sauce, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 lb Firm tofu; patted dry
1 tb Tamari (soy) sauce
2/3 c  Natural style peanut butter
1 tb Lemon juice
1/2 ts Minced fresh ginger
1    Garlic clove; minced
2 tb Water
A little fatty but great in a sandwich with cucumber slices!

Puree the tofu and tamari into a smooth thick paste. Transfer into a
bowl. With a fork, vigorously beat in all remaining ingredients. =-If
you are like me, just toss everything into the blender and forget the
fork part<G>=- Let stand 30 mins at room temperature before serving.
This will keep 3 to 5 days covered in the refrigerator.
