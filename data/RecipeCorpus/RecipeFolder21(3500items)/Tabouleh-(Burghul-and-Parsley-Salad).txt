Title: Tabouleh (Burghul and Parsley Salad)
Categories: Misc/food, Salad, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
3/4 c  Fine burghul
2 c  Cold water
2 c  Chopped parsley
1/2 c  Finely chopped spring onions
1/4 c  Finely chopped mint
1/4 c  Olive oil
2 tb Lemon juice
1 1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2    Firm ripe tomatoes
Crisp lettuce leaves
1/4 c  Lemon juice; mixed with:
1/2 ts Salt
Place burghul in a bowl and cover with the cold water.  Leave to soak
for 30 minutes.  Drain through a fine sieve, pressing with back of a
spoon to extract moisture.  Spread onto a cloth and leave to dry
further.

Meanwhile, prepare parsley.  Wash well, shake off excess moisture and
remove thick stalks.  Wrap in a tea towel and place in refrigerator to
crisp and dry.

Put burghul into a mixing bowl and add spring onions.  Squeeze
mixture with hand so that burghul absorbs onion flavour.

Chop parsley fairly coarsley, measure and add to burghul with mint.

Beat olive oil with lemon juice and stir in salt and pepper.  Add to
salad and toss well.

Peel and seed tomatoes and cut into dice.  Gently stir into salad.
Cover and chill for at least 1 hour before serving.

Serve in salad bowl lined with crisp lettuce leaves.  Lemon juice and
salt mixture is served in a jug so that it may be added according to
individual taste.

Serves 6-8
