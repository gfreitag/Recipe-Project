Title: Pan-Fried Brook Trout with Bacon
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 servings
8    Slices of lean bacon
4    3/4 lb. brook trout,
Cleaned
1 c  Milk
1 c  Crushed Triscuit cracker
Crumbs
In a large skillet cook the bacon over moderately low heat, turning
it, until it is just crisp and transfer it to paper towels to drain.
Dip the trout in the mlk and dredge them in the crumbs, packing the
crumbs well onto all sides to form a thick coating.  In the fat
remaining in the skillet saute the trout over moderate heat for 5 to
6 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and just flake
when tested, and serve them with the bacon, crumbled. The Best of
