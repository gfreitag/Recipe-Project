Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Paella
Yield: 4 servings
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 1/4 c  Long-grain brown rice
1 lg Onion; peeled and sliced
2 lg Garlic cloves; crushed
1 pn Saffron strands
3 c  Light Vegetable Stock
-(generous measure) OR water
1/2    Lemon; thinly pared rind,
- cut into thin shreds
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 lb Washed and trimmed leeks
- cut into 1-inch lengths
1/4 c  Frozen peas
1/4 c  Black olives, or more
MMMMM-------------------------TO GARNISH------------------------------
Parsley; chopped
Heat the oil in a large, deep pan.  Add the long-grain brown rice and
onion slices and stir until the rice is coated and begins to turn
opaque. Add the garlic, saffron, stock or wate, lemon rind and salt
and pepper. Mix well, then bring to a boil.  Mix again, to distribute
the saffron coloring.

Arrange the vegetables and olives attractively on top of the rice.
Bring to a boil.  Cover with a lid or foil and simmer for 45 minutes.

Sprinkle with parsley and serve straight from the pan.

May be served with blanched almonds, slivered Brazil nuts or whole
cashew nuts- separately, in a bowl - for people to help themselves to
if they like.

Variation: VEGETARIAN PAELLA WITH ARTICHOKES: Use 4 to 6 globe
artichokes instead of the leeks.  Very tender baby artichokes can
simply be quartered; otherwise cut the leaves and choke from the
artichokes, then halve or quarter the artichoke bottoms.  Garnish
with artichoke leaves.
