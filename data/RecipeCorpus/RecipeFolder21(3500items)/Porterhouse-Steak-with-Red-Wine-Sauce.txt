Title: Porterhouse Steak with Red Wine Sauce
Categories: Beef, Salsa/sauce, Meat
Yield: 4 servings
3 lb Porterhouse steak
About 2 1/2-in. thick
Salt and pepper
2 tb Vegetable oil
3 tb Butter
1 tb Shallots, chopped
1/2 c  Burgundy or cabernet
1/2 c  Brown sauce or
Canned brown beef gravy
1. Select a very heavy skillet for this. A heavy, traditional black
iron skillet is excellent. Sprinkle the steak on both sides with salt
and pepper. Use a fairly generous amount of black pepper. Pat with
the fingers to make the seasoning adhere. 2. Heat the oil in the
skillet and when quite hot, add the steak. The primary goal is to
sear the steak well on both sides over moderately high heat. Cook the
steak on the first side about 5-7 min. until it is quite dark without
burning. Turn the steak and cook about 10 min. on the other side,
until quite dark but not burnt. 3. Reduce the heat slightly and turn
the steak again. Cook about 10 min., then turn the steak again.
Continue cooking, turning as necessary. The total cooking time
recommended is about 45 min, from start to finish. 4. Remove the
steak from the skillet and cover loosely with foil. Let rest so that
the internal juices are redistributed. 5. Meanwhile, pour off the fat
from the skillet. Wipe lightly with paper towels. Add 1 tbsp of
butter to the skillet and stir to dissolve the browned particles that
cling to the bottom. Add the shallots and cook briefly. 6. Add the
wine and boil to reduce about 30 sec. Stir in the brown gravy and
reduce to 2/3. Remove from the heat and swirl in the remaining
butter. 7. To serve, spoon a little of the sauce onto each of 4 hot
plates. Slice the steak and place the slices on the sauce.
