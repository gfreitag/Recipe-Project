MARBLED STRAWBERRY MOUSSE Early in day or day ahead:

Prepare collar for 1-1/2 quart souffle dish: tear off 20-inch strip of
waxed paper; fold lengthwise to make a 20-inch by 6-inch strip. Wrap
strip around outside of dish so collar stand 2 inches above rim.

In food processor or blender, puree strawberries. Pour 1 cup puree
into a small bowl, remaining puree into a large bowl.

In 1 quart saucepan, mix gelatin, sugar and salt. Add water; cook
over low heat until gelatin is completely dissolved, stirring often.
Into puree in small bowl, stir 2 tablespoons of gelatin mixture. Into
puree in large bowl, stir lemon juice, vanilla, and remaining gelatin
mixture. Refrigerate mixtures, stirring often, until mixtures mound
when dropped from spoon (about 45 minutes).

In small bowl, with mixer at high speed, beat egg whites until stiff
peaks form. In large bowl, with mixer at medium speed, beat cream
until stiff peaks form. Using a spatula, gently fold egg whites and
cream into strawberry mixture in the large bowl.

Alternately spoon strawberry mixtures from large and small bowls into
prepared souffle dish. Cut through mixtures with knife to make marbled
design, then cover and refrigerate until mousse is set (about 3
hours). Carefully remove waxed paper collar before serving.

Makes 12 servings.

NOTE: I think this dessert tastes better when it is made a day ahead
so the flavors blend, but it doesn't look as nice (the egg whites and
whipped cream start to lose volume, so it starts to lose its shape
and height). If appearance is important to you, make it early the day
it is to be eaten.
