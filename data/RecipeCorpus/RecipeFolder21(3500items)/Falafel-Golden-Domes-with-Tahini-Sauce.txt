Remove the skins from the cooked chickpeas by rubbing them with a dish
towel.

Place the chickpeas in a food processor and purÂ‚e them.

Add the garlic, baking powder, coriander, cumin, parsley, onions,
scallions, and cilantro.  Blend the ingredients together so that a
smooth paste is formed.  Add some water if necessary.  Let the
mixture rest for 30 minutes.

Form the paste into patties that are 2" in diameter and 1/2" thick.

In a medium large saucepan place the vegetable oil and heat it on
medium high until it is hot.  Add the patties and deep-fry them for 2
to 3 minutes, or until they are golden brown.  Drain them on paper
towels.

In each of the pita breads place some of the falafel, tomatoes, lemon
juice, and Tahini Sauce.

For Tahini Sauce: In a small bowl place the tahini, water, and lemon
juice. Mix the ingredients together so that a smooth sauce is formed
(add more water if necessary).

Add the garlic, parsley, and black pepper.  Mix them in so that they
are well blended.
