FOR CREPES: Blend the egg replacer w/1/2C water until smooth.  Add
remaining ingredients and blend one minute at high speed.

Heat a crepe pan or non stick 8" skillet over low heat, brush the
bottom lightly w/oil (I use unrefined corn oil).  When pan is heated,
take it off the burner, let cool about three seconds and pour 3-4T
batter into it. Swirl the pan so the bottom is coated w/a thin layer
of batter.  Put the pan back on the burner and cook until lightly
browned.  Flip the crepe and cook until that side is lightly browned
as well.  Repeat w/remaining batter.  This makes about a dozen
crepes.  Note that you will inevitably screw up the first crepe or
two, but it will become fairly routine after that.  Don't worry about
it, I still do that after all these years.

FOR STUFFING: Saute the onion in a little dry white wine for a minute
or two, then add wild rice and stock, cover tightly, bring to a boil,
turn heat to low and cook about an hour, until all liquid is absorbed.

While the rice cooks, saute celery in oil until slightly tender, add
onions and all mushrooms, and saute until all vegs are medium tender.
Add cooked rice, tomato and seasoning and cook another ten minutes or
so. Fill crepes w/the mixture, roll them over it and heat in a
preheated oven at 350 for about ten minutes.

Serve w/Nutty Almond Sauce and garnish w/parsley and a twisted orange
slice.

FOR NUTTY ALMOND SAUCE: Toast almonds until golden, then pulverize.
(Don't overgrind or you'll get almond butter.)

Heat oil a few minutes in a heavy bottomed skillet, then stir in
flour and cook 2-3 minutes on low, until fragrant.  Stir in soy milk
and continue to stir until it begins to thicken, then stir in
seasonings. Cover and cook 10 more minutes, but stir often to prevent
scorching. Stir in almonds and cook another 4-5 minutes.

Serve w/a simple spinach salad w/mustard vinaigrette and French bread,
along w/a chilled white wine.
