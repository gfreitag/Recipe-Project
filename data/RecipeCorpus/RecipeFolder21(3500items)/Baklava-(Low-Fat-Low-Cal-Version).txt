This rich-tasting baklava contains half the amount of sugar and a
fraction of the fat you would normally use, thanks to reduced fats,
sugar, and nuts. The results will fool anyone.

1. Combine pistacho nuts, sugar, cinnamon and rose water in small
bowl. Using half of filo sheets (cover remaining with plastic wrap to
prevent from drying out), place 3 sheets in bottom of lightly greased
13x9" baking sheet. Brush with some of margarine. Sprinkle evenly
with nut mixture. Place remaining sheets over nut filling, brushing
after every third sheet and top sheet. 2. Cut baklava at 1-1/2"
intervals diagonally to form pattern of about 35 diamond shapes. Bake
at 400'F. 25 minutes or until golden. Place on wire rack to cool.
Drizzle Rose Water Syrup evenly over top and allow to soak several
hours. Stud each diamond-shape with whole clove.
