Title: Indian French Toast
Categories: Indian, Vegetarian
Yield: 2 servings
1/3 c  Besan (chick pea) flour
1/4 c  Mashed tofu
3/4 c  Water
3    -to
4 tb Margarine
2    -to
4    Hot green chilies
1/4 c  Cilantro
1 sl Ginger (1/2")
2 tb Chopped onion
1/2 ts Salt; to taste
4 sl Bread *
* (I like sourdough, and I recommend not using a really dark type.)

Put everything but the bread and margarine into the blender/food
processor/ other implement of destruction and blend until the herbs
are medium chooped. Pour the resulting batter into a wide shallow
dish. (She says it'll keep three days covered in the frig, if you
plan meals that far ahead.  I don't.)

Melt the margarine in a big skillet or frying pan.  Soak one slice of
bread at a time in the batter until pretty gloppy, then toss into the
skillet and fry until the bottom is medium brown, then flip and cook
about another minute.

Serve right off the stove.
