Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
1 tb Chinese rice wine
-or dry sherry
1 tb Light soy sauce
1 ts Cornstarch
1/2 lb Boneless pork butt
-or shoulder, shredded
1/2 c  Shredded lily stems
1/4 c  Tree ears; soaked,
- squeezed dry and shredded
4    Scallions; shredded
1/4 c  Shredded bamboo shoots
5 tb Peanut oil
4    Eggs; lightly beaten
3 tb Chicken broth
1/2 ts Sugar
1 tb Chinese rice wine
-or dry sherry
1 ts Light soy sauce
2 ts Sesame oil
Salt to taste
MARINATE THE SHREDDED PORK for 20 to 30 minutes. Prepare all the other
shredded ingredients--tree ears, lily stems, scallions and bamboo
shoots. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a wok over a moderate flame
and pour in the beaten eggs. As soon as the egg begins to cling to
the wok, scoop it and fold it over to scramble it. Work fast because
the egg solidifies quickly and it can overcook. As soon as it
solidifies, remove it from the wok and set it aside. Stir-fry the
pork over high heat in 1 tablespoon of the oil for 30 seconds, or
until it no longer looks raw. Remove it from the wok and set it
aside. In the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil, stir-fry the
vegetables, more to combine them and heat them through than to cook
them. Add the pork and mix it well with the seasonings. Finally, add
the eggs, breaking them up to form bite-size lumps. Combine the
ingredients well. Serve alone or with a platter of heated pancakes
and a small bowl of hoisin sauce. Serves 2 to 4 as a main course.
