Quickly roll out the pastry and cut out six 4-5" rounds. Place rounds
on a thick baking sheet and sprinkle with a little cold water. Place
baking sheet in freezer until ready to assemble and bake tarts. Slice
the tomatoes and lay them on paper towels for thirty minutes to drain
off excess moisture. This will prevent the tarts from being soggy.
One half hour before serving, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Take
the baking sheet from the freezer and spread a layer of Thick Tomato
Coulis over the pastry rounds leaving 1/2 inch rim around the edge.
Arrange the drained tomato slices over the coulis and scatter with
shredded basil. Sprinkle with salt and some freshly grated black
pepper then drizzle with oil. Immediately place in the oven and bake
for 20 minutes or until the pastry is puffed and golden. Serve at
once.
