Contributed to the echo by: Melvin Hatcher Re: Minced Barbeque A few
days ago someone requested for me to repost this minced barbeque
recipe. MINCED BARBEQUE Add enough water to cover meat. Soak for 8 to
10 hrs

1. Wash meat rinse, and soak. 2. After soaking, boil meat in the
mixture until done. Make sure fat
side is facing up. 3. As meat boil taste mixture for vinegar
flavor, add vinegar to taste. 4. Do not cook meat until mushy, must
be able to chop or cube meat easily. 5. Let meat cool in mixture,
remove chop and/or cube. 6. Place chopped meat in large pan or
skillet. 7. Taste meat to see if extra seasoning are required. 8. Add
about 1 tablespoon of ketchup,vinegar,sugar,pepper,and salt to
taste.

P.S. If you use the whole bottle of vinegar, it's ok.

Serve with cole slaw, or baked beans.
