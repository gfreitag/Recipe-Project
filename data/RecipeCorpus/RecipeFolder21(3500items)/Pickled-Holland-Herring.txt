Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
1    Keg holland herring
MMMMM----------------FOR EACH WIDE MOUTH JAR (QUA---------------------
2 c  Spanish onions coarsely cut
Divided
1/2 ts Mustard seed
1/2 ts Whole black peppercorns
1/4 ts Salt
1/2    Half bay leaf
White pepper
Drain brine from keg and clean herring cutting off tail and head if
necessary. Soak in refrigerator for at least 24 hours in about 3
gallons of water, soak longer and change water 5-6 times if herring
are packed in salty brine. This will vary because of varieties of
herring - salt, schmaltz, matjes and bismark - and they vary as to
saltiness and firmness. To bone herring, take a sharp, pointed knife
and slit along the backbone, starting with the head end on your left
hand side, grasped firmly by your left hand, and traveling the knife
across the spine, going about an inch down toward the bone until you
come to the tail end. Bend the tail sharply to break it, then reverse
the fish and move back along the spine, loosening flesh from bone
with index finger and thumb. Roll slivers of fillet around pieces of
dill pickle and fasten with a toothpick, you can make these large or
smaller, for appetizers. In each jar, place 1 cup onions, the mustard
seed, peppercorns, salt and bay leaf. Pack in rolmops, the remaining
1 cup onions, then fill empty spaces around herring with mixture of
1/2 water, 1/2 vinegar. Place lid on jar and shake from side to side
to get rid of air bubbles. Remove lid and add more water and vinegar
mixture to fill completelt. Cover again and refrigerate for 10 days.
Rolmops must be eaten within 4 weeks, or they get soft.
