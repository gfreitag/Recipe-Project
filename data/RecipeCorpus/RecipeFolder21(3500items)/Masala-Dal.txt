1 1/2 c  Yellow split peas
1/3 ts Turmeric
2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Ghee
1 ts Cumin seeds
1 1/2 c  Finely chopped onions
1/4 ts Red pepper
2 tb Chopped coriander leaves
Wash peas well.  Place in a bowl, cover with hot water & let sit for
an hour.  Drain.  Place in a large pot, add 4 1/2 cups water & throw
in the turmeric.  Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.  Reduce
heat to medium low, partially cover & simmer for 45 minutes.  Remove
from heat, beat with a wire whisk till the mixture is finely pureed.

cumin seeds & fry for 10 seconds.  Lower heat, add onions & fry for
20 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning.  Stir in red
pepper & immediately pour in to the puree.  Garnish with coriander.
