3 lb Honyeycomb tripe
4 tb Butter
4 tb Olive oil
1 lg Onion sliced
1/3 c  Fresh chopped parsley
8 oz Can tomato sauce
1 c  Water
Salt and pepper to taste
Parboil the tripe for about 1 hour. When cool enough to handle, cut
into strips about 1"by 3". Saute onion in butter and olive oil. When
they are golden add the rest of the ingredients andmix well. Simmer
for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until tender. If needed, add a bit more water
at the end to make just a bit of sauce to soak up with some good
crusty bread. Serve hot with grated cheese on the side. Don`t forget
the bread.
Variation: with a few minor adjustments, you can use this as a pasta
sauce. Cut the tripe a bit smaller and add about 4 more oz of tomato
sauce and 1/2 cup of dry wine, white or red. This will give you more
sauce for the spaghetti. Don`t forget to adjust the salt and pepper.
