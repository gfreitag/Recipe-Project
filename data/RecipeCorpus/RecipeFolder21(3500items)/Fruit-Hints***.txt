I'm not at all good with desserts. My favorite thing after a big meal
is fruit. I know, you`re going to say "how boring!"Just give me a
chance. I have some tricks in my apron pocket! I`ll give you just a
few ideas now.

GRAPES...why not run them under cold water, dust with regular sugar
and put them in the freezer for an hour? They won`t last long enough
on your table to defrost. Try mixing a bowl of different colored
grapes.

PEACHES....Take about 1 peach per person, especially in the
winter.(These Chili fruits look great, but their flavor is missing
something.) Slice them in wedges, sprinkle with cinnamon, add a tbls
of some liqueur, any flavor and cover and cook in the microwave for
5-7 min. Serve as you would applesauce with a pork roast. It`s great
with any roast. You can also make a mixture of fruits for this, pear,
nectarine,plums...use your immagination. STRAWBERRIES.....The season
is coming soon and I want you all prepared for this one. It`s the
best. I can`t tell you how much to make for how many people, because
no matter how much you make it will NEVER be enough. Wash strawberrys
well, THEN take off the top or any bruises. (you don`t want to wash
away any flavor) cut each one in half or thirds if you must. Place in
a large bowl that has a secure cover or a large jar. Add a few tbls
sugar and the juice of a fresh lemon or two. Fill your container 2/3
nearly covering berries.Place the cover on and shake gently. Place in
refrig for at least 6 hour turning and shaking every hour or so. You
need not serve anything else with this, just make sure to provide
juice glasses and a ladle when the berries are done. Then just sit
back and relax.
