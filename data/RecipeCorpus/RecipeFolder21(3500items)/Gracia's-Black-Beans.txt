Title: Gracia's Black Beans
Categories: Vegetarian, Low-cal/fat
Yield: 8 servings
3 c  Dry black beans
1 ts Crushed garlic
1 ts Salt
Hot red pepper (optional)
Freshly ground black pepper
Extra virgin olive oil
1 lg Yellow onion; minced
Rinse and sort the beans and bring to a boil in a large pot of
unsalted water. Simmer for about an hour, stirring occasionally and
adding water when needed. Cover and soak overnight.  The next day,
pour off the soaking water and add enough fresh water to cover the
beans.  Bring to a boil again and let simmer (stirring occasionally
and adding water if needed) until tender enough to eat. Strain,
saving some of the pepper and red pepper. In the bottom of a large
saucepan, heat enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan.  Add
the garlic mixture to the hot oil and stir once. Add the minced onion
and cook until the onion is slightly transparent. Add the beans and
some of the liquid and heat until hot enough to eat. Serve over rice.
