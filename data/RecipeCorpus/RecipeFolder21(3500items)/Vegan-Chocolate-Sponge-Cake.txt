Preheat the oven to 325 F.  Grease two 8- to 8-1/2-inch shallow cake
pans and line the base of each with a circle of greased wax paper.

Sift the flour, cocoa powder and baking powder into a bowl.  Add the
sugar, oil and water.  Mix well to a batter-like consistency.  Pour
the mixture into the prepared pans and bake for about 40 minutes,
until the cakes spring back to a light touch in the center.

Turn the cakes out onto a wire rack and strip off the wax paper.
Allow to cool completely.

Sandwich the cake together with half the fudge icing or chocolate
buttercream and coat the top with the rest.  Sprinkle on a little
grated chocolate and confectioners' sugar.

Variation: VEGAN LEMON CAKE: Use the additional amount of flour and
omit the cocoa powder.  Replace 2 tb. water with lemon juice and add
the grated lemon rind.  Sandwich the cakes together and coat the top
with lemon buttercream or fudge icing and decorate the cake with
yellow sugar decorations and leaves cut from angelica.
