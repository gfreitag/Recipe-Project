Title: Boned Oysters
Categories: Greek, Seafood
Yield: 1 servings
12    Oysters
1 c  Flour
1/2 c  Oil
Salt and pepper; to taste
Use only the large Asiatic oysters caught in the Indian Ocean, Black
Sea, or the Persian and Arabian gulfs.

Use the delicious white meat only.  Discard the round white bone
sometimes discovered inside the shell -- or give it to some Persian.
They seem to prefer these bones to gold; they call them "pearls".
