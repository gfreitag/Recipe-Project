Title: Stuffed Artichokes I
Categories: Main dish, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
4    Fresh, whole artichokes
3 1/2 c  Italian seasoned crumbs
4    Cloves garlic, minced
3/4 c  Italian cheese, grated
Olive oil
Sut off stems of artichokes and across 1" of top leaves.  Remove
prickly tip of other leaves by clipping off top.  Rinse thoroughly in
cold water, drain.  Press top, cut side down, firmly to force leaves
to open slightly. Pull leaves gently to open far enough to stuff.
Combine bread crumbs, garlic and grated cheese, mix thoroughly.  Set
artichoke, bottom down, and pour stuffing into cavities formed by
leaves.  Stuff as manyh leaves as possible.  Put abt. 1/2  of salted
water and 1/4 cup olive oil in pot, bring to gentle boil.  Place
chokes in pan, bottom down, and cover pot tightly.  Cook abt. 20
minutes.  The chokes will steam and stuffing will be moistened.
Remove cover and dribble olive oil onto stuffing until thoroughly
moistened.  Re-cover and continue to cook 20 min. longer or until
bottom leaves pull away easily.
