2. Add the peas, garlic, about 1 1/4 quarts of water, or to barely

boil and let simmer, uncovered, 30-40 minutes, until tender but not
mushy. Remove from heat. 3. Put the rice in a saucepan and add 1 1/2
cups water and salt to taste. Bring to the boil and let set 17

the center of a platter.  Spoon the hot pea mixture, including
liquid, over the rice.  Scatter the cheese over the peas. Place
tomato cubes around the rice.  Scatter the scallions over the
tomatoes. Serve immediately.
