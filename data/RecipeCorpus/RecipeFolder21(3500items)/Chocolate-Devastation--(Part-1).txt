1/4 ts Cream of tartar
1/8 ts Salt
MMMMM--------------------BITTERSWEET GANACHE-------------------------
2 c  Heavy cream
2 tb Unsalted butter
2 tb Sugar
8 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
Combine the raisins and whiskey in a plastic container with a tight
fitting lid. Allow to stand at room temperature for 6 hours or
overnight. Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler
over medium heat. Place 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, 1/2 cup heavy
cream, and 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate in the top half of the
double boiler. Tightly cover the top with ilm wrap. Heat for 10
minutes, then remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Transfer to
a stainless steel bowl and set aside until needed. Heat the remaining
1 1/2 c heavy cream and the half-and-half in a 2 1/2-qt. saucepan
over medium-high heat. Bring the cream to a boil. While the cream is
heating, place 8 egg yolks and 1/4 cup sugar in the bowl of an
electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat the eggs on high for 2 to 2
1/2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Continue to beat on
high until slightly thickened and lemon-colored, about 2 1/2 to 3
minutes. (At this point, the cream should be boiling. If not, adjust
the mixer speed to low and continue to mix until the cream boils. If
this is not done, the egg yolks will develop undesirable lumps.) Pour
the boiling cream into the beaten egg yolks and whisk to combine.
Return to the saucepan and heat over medium-high heat, stirring
constantly, until the cream reaches a temperature of 185~, 2-4
minutes. Then pour into the melted chocolate mixture, and stir to
combine. Cool the mixture in an ice-water bath to a temperature of
40-45~, about 15-20 minutes. Line 2, 8" cake pans with enough film
wrap to cover the insides of the pan. Set aside until needed. Fold
the whiskey-soaked raisins and any residual liquid into the cooled
chocolate custard mixture. Freeze in an ice cream freezer following
the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer the semi-frozen ice cream
to the 2 cake pans, evenly dividing the ice cream between the two
pans. Use a rubber spatula to spread the ice cream evenly to the
edges of the pans. Tightly cover the tops of the pans with film wrap,
then place in the freezer for at least 12 hours before assembling the
cake. See part 2 for rest of directions.
