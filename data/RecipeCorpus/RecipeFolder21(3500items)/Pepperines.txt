Title: Pepperines
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 85 servings
1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Coarsely ground pepper
1 ts Sugar
2 tb Oil
1/2 c  Water
2 tb Lemon juice
"If saltines don't excite you, try pepperines. They're good by
themselves, and they spice up soups, stews, and dips. 350~F. 15 to 20
minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.

Mix the flour, salt, pepper, and sugar in a large bowl or in the food
processor. Add the oil and blend until the mixture resembles coarse
meal.

Combine 1/4 cup of the water and the lemon juice in a small bowl.
Blend it into the flour mixture. Add enough of the remaining 1/4 cup
water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll each in a rectangular shape. The dough
should be as thin as possible, 1/16 inch at most.

Using a spatula, rolling pin, or your hands, pick up the rolled dough
and trasfer it onto an ungreased baking sheet. With a sharp knife,
score into 2-inch squares. Do not cut all the way through to the
baking sheet. Prick each cracker 2 or 3 times with a fork.

Bake 15 to 20 minutes, turning over after 10 minutes or when the edges
begin to brown. Cool on a rack. Break into individual crackers. Yield:
75-85.

VARIATIONS: If a hotter cracker is desired, add more pepper. For
red-hot cracker, sprinkle 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper on top
of the dough before making a final pass ith your rolling pin.
