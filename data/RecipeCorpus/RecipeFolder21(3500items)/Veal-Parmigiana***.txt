1 1/2 lb Veal Cutlets sliced thin and
-pounded (except for fish)
4    Beaten eggs, lightly salted
Dry bread crumbs (seasoned
-or plain)
Olive oil for frying
Grated cheese and slices of
-mozzarella (1 per cutlet)
*(can be used for chicken, turkey, or fish fillets) Dip each cutlet
into egg, breadcrumbs, and quickly into egg again. Put into hot, but
not smoking olive oil. (If oil is too hot cutlets will burn before
they cook; if oil is not hot enough, cutlets will soak up oil and
breading will not stick.) Cook each one about 3-4 min. on each side
until golden brown. Drain well on paper towels or brown bags. When
all cutlets are done, arrange in a shallow baking dish. Ladle sauce
on top of each one to mostly cover it, but don`t let it swim in
sauce. Generously sprinkle with grated cheese. Top with mozzarella
slices and bake in oven for about 20 min. until cheese melts. Serve
hot with pasta on the side.
