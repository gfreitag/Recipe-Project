Title: Malted Milk Crackers
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 45 servings
1 c  All-purpose flour
1 1/2 c  Instant malted milk
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 c  Water
"The malt in these dessert crackers will remind you of the
old-fashioned soda shop. Served alone or with a hot cup of coffee,
they are a delightful alternative to cookies. 325~F. 10 to 12 minutes
Preheat the oven to 325~F.

Mix the flours, malted milk, and salt together in a large bowl or in
the food processor. Add the vanilla extract and mix well. Cut in the
shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Slowly blend in
enough of the water to form a dough that will hold together in a
cohesive ball. The dough should be soft, but not sticky. For easier
rolling, wrap the dough in wax paper and chill 1/2 hour.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a well-floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out to between 1/16 and 1/8 inch thick.
With a sharp knife or cookie cutter, cut the dough into 2-inch
squares or circles.

Place the circles on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
sheet an prick each one in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until light brown, turning over once
during baking. Allow to cool on a rack. Yield: 40-45.

VARIATION: For a unique flavor, add 2 Tablespoons carob flour (St.
John's bread) to the dry ingredients. Lower the oven temperature to
300~F. to prevent scorching. Cooking time will be increased by a few
minutes.
