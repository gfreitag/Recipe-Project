Title: Granola Bars
Categories: Snack, Cake/cookie, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Light corn syrup
1/2 c  Melted margarine
2/3 c  Peanut butter
2 ts Vanilla extract
3 c  Quick oats *
1/2 c  Sunflower seeds
1/2 c  Coconut
1/3 c  Wheat germ
1/2 c  Raisins
1 c  Carob chips
Other nuts/dried fruits
-you want to add
*Note: (I substitute half quick oats and half crisped rice)

Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Grease the bottom of a 9x12 (9x13?)
baking dish (glass works best).  In a large bowl, combine the first 5
ingredients and stir well (it should be sort of a paste).  Stir in
remaining ingredients. You can add in whatever you want, so long as
the mixture is sticking together in several large clumps.  Press the
mixture into the baking pan ( you can use your fingers -- it's not
very sticky).  Bake at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes (until it turns golden
brown).  Cool completely and cut into bars. Voila!
