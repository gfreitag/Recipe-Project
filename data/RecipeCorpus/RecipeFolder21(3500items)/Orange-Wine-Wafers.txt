Title: Orange-Wine Wafers
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 50 servings
2 1/2 tb Orange zest (2 large
Oranges)
2 c  Pastry or all-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Baking powder
2 tb (1/4 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
1/2 c  White wine
"A perfectly simple cracker delicately flavored with orange zest and
wine, this is an ideal match for a glass of white wine. We prefer to
use Chardonnay, but any dry white wine that you may have already
opened will work well. 350~F. 15 to 20 minutes Preheat the oven to
350~F.

To prepare the zest, lightly grate the outer peel of the oranges
against the fine grate of a cheese grater. Use only the colored part
of the rind; the underlying white portion is bitter.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flour, orange
zest, salt, and baking powder. Cut in the butter until the mixture
resembles coarse meal. While stirring, add the wine in a slow stream
and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.

On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to a rectangle
approximately 1/4 inch thick and position so the long edge runs
horizontally in front of you. Fold the left third of the dough over
the center third. Likewise, fold the right third over the center. The
dough is now in 3 layers with the seam running vertically. Give the
dough a quarter turn so the seam now runs horizontally. Roll out the
dough again to a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Fold and turn the
dough again as in the first step. You are now ready for the final
rolling.

Roll the dough out somewhat thinner this time, about 1/8 inch thick.
With a sharp knife, cut in to 2-inch squares or shapes as desired and
place each one on an ungreased baking sheet.

Prick each cracker all the way through 2 or 3 times with the tines of
a fork. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove to a
rack to cool. Yield: 40-50.
