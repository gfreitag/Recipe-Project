3    New York strip steaks
3/4 c  Soy sauce
3/4 c  Sake
1/2 c  Mirin
2 c  Dashi

wines can be bought in most liquor stores. Dashi, a base for Japanese
soup stock,is available in most Oriental stores.) Bring to boil.Add
steak and return to boil.Cook 3 to 5 minutes.Be careful not to
overcook the meat;it should be rare on the inside. Remove steak,wrap
in foil and refrigerate overnight. Continue boiling,cooking until
liquid has reduced to a thick sauce. You can tell when it is
done,because the sauce makes large, slow bubbles when it is ready.Be
careful; otherwise the sauce will burn. Refrigerate overnight. To
serve: Cut all fat from steaks. Slice in very thin slices. Arrange on
a plate. Just before serving; pour 1 tsp. of reduced cooking sauce
over meat. You can also garnish with a little chopped green onion.
For an appetizer serving, allow 5 to 7 slices per person. Serves 6.
