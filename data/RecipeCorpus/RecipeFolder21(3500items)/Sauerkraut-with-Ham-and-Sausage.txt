under cold running water and drain in a colander. Press to extract
excess moisture. 2. Heat the bacon in a casserole or dutch oven and
cook until rendered of fat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until
the onion is wilted. 3. Add the sauerkraut. Tie the bay leaf, juniper

steak and sausage in or over the sauerkraut. Cover closely and cook 1
hr. 4. Discard the cheesecloth bag. Serve the sauerkraut and meats
