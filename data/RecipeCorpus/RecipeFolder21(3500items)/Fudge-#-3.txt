Title: Fudge # 3
Categories: Dessert
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Firmly Packed Light Brown
Sugar
2 c  White Sugar (Or You Can Use
All White Sugar)
1 c  Milk
1 1/2 tb Butter
2 oz Unsweetened Chocolate
Old Method:

Stir constantly all the time it is boiling.  Flavor with vanilla (1
Tsp). After you take it off the stove, stir until it is almost hard,
then pour into a buttered pan. (NOTE: This is a paraphrased recipe
from a very old cookbook)

Modern Method:

Butter the sides of a 3-quart saucepan, prewarm the candy
thermometer. Use the same ingredients as above but substitute 1 cup
Half and Half for the milk.  Dump in the pan. Stir constantly until
the sugar is dissolved and it comes to a boil.  Reduce the heat while
retaining the boil and continue cooking, stirring infrequently if at
all. When it reaches the soft ball stage, around 234 to 240 degrees
F. (112 to 115.5 degrees C.) remove from the heat and flavor with 1
tsp of vanilla. Do not shock immediately (NOTE: The shocking is done
by putting the pan in a large square pan full of ice or cold water).
However, when the fudge cools on top (hold your hand over the candy
to check) place the pan in cool water to equalize the heat between
the bottom and top of the pan. Stir gently, it will candy almost
immediately; pour into a buttered 8 X 8-inch pan. SERVES 4 OR 1
