Categories: Salad
Yield: 1 servings
6 lg Oranges (navel)
1 ts Honey
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1 lb Mixed fresh greens (half
Spinach and half romaine
Works best)
1/2 c  Thin sliced purple onion
1 c  Thin sliced radishes
1 c  Toasted walnut halves chop
Into smaller pieces if you
Wish
3 tb Quality olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
At least 1 1/2 hours before serving, peel and section the oranges.
With a serrated knife or citrus knife, remove the membrane lining
from each orange segment. Place oranges in a bowl and squeeze all
excess juice from the remaining lining over the oranges. Discard any
membrane and pick out seeds, if necessary. Drizzle honey and sprinkle
cinnamon over oranges, cover and let stand at room temperature for at
least 1 hour. Clean greens and pat dry. Break into bite size pieces
and toss well with onions, radishes and nuts in a large bowl. Drizzle
olive oil over salad and toss to distribute. Season to taste with
salt and freshly ground pepper. Just before serving, add the oranges
and all their liquid. Mix well.
