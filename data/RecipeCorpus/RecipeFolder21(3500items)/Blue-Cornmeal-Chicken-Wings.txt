Mix lime juice, oil and red pepper flakes in a large glass bowl. Cut
each chicken wing at joints to make 3 pieces; discard tip. Cut off
discard excess skin. Place wings in oil mixture; stir to coat. Cover
and refrigerate at least 3 hours, stirring occasionally; drain.

Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Heat margarine in rectanglar pan,
13x9x2", in oven until melted. Shake remaining ingredients in plastic
bag, or mix in bowl. Shake wings in cornmeal mixture to coat; place

be as hot as you want it by adding more.
