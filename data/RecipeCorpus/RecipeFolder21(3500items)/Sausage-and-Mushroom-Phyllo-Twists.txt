Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 lb Pork sausage meat crumbled
1 sm Onion, minced
1 cl Garlic, minced
1 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 lb Mushroom chopped fine
1/2 ts Ground cumin
Pinch of allspice
1/2 ts Dried crumbled mint
1/4 c  Minced fresh parsley
Leaves
2 oz Cream cheese softened
4    16 x 12 inch sheets phyllo
Stacked between 2 sheets of
Wax paper and covered with
Damp dish towel
1/4 c  Clarified butter
2 tb Fine fresh bread crumbs
In a large skillet cook the sausage meat over moderately high heat,
stirring and breaking up any larger pieces, until it is cooked
through and browned. Transfer meat to a fine sieve, and drain. In the
skillet, cook the onion and the garlic in the unsalted butter over
moderately low heat until the onion is softened. Add the mushrooms,
and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring until the liquid
the mushrooms give off evaporates. Add the cumin, allspice and the
mint and cook the mixture, stirring, for 2 minutes. Transfer the
mixture to a bowl, add the sausage meat, the parsley, cream cheese,
and salt and pepper to taste, and combine the mixture well. Working
quickly to keep the phyllo from drying out, put 1 sheet of phyllo on
a work surface, brush lightly with some of the clarified butter, and
sprinkle with 1 Tb of the bread crumbs. Lay another sheet of phyllo
on top of the first sheet and brush lightly with some of the
remaining clarified butter. Cut the sheets into thirds lengthwise and
into quarters crosswise to form 12 squares. Put a rounded ts of the
filling in each square, gather the corners of the phyllo over the
filling, and twist the phyllo gently to seal it. Continue to make
hors d'oeuvres in the same manner with the remaining phyllo, butter,
crumbs and filling. Bake the sausage and mushroom phyllo twists in
jelly-roll pans in a preheated oven at 400 degrees for 10-12
minutes,or until phyllo is golden brown.
