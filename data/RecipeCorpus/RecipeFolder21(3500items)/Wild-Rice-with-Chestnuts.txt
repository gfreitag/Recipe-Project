Title: Wild Rice with Chestnuts
Categories: Side dish, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Oil
5 md Shallots
- peeled and finely chopped
2    Celery ribs; finely chopped
1 c  Wild rice; rinsed
1/3 c  Dried, peeled chestnuts
1/4 c  Dried currants
2 ts Aniseed
1/4 ts Sea salt; or to taste
4 c  Water
1 ts Finely chopped orange zest
-OR- grated
PRESSURE COOKER: Heat the oil in the cooker.  Add the shallots and
celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened slightly, about
1 minute. Stir in the rice, chestnuts, currants, aniseed, salt, and
water.

Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure.
Lower the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 25
minutes. Allow the pressure to come down naturally or use a quick
release method. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any
excess steam to escape. If the rice or chestnuts are not quite
cooked, return to high pressure for a few minutes.

Drain (reserving the liquid for stock) and return to the pot.  Cover
and let steam over low heat for a few minutes to dry out.  Fluff up
as you stir in the orange peel.  Break up chestnuts into 2 to 3
pieces with a fork, if desired.

STANDARD STOVETOP: Soak the chestnuts overnight.  Drain and reserve
the water.  In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil.  Add the
shallots and celery and saute for 1 minute.  Add the chestnut soaking
liqiud plus enough water to equal 3 cups and bring to a boil.  Stir
in the rice, reserved chestnuts, currants, aniseed, and salt.  Return
to the boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer until most of the grains
have butterflied and almost all the liquid has been absorbed, about
50 minutes.  Let stand, covered, off heat for 10 minutes.  If there
is still liquid left in the bottom of the pot, lift out the rice with
a slotted spoon.
