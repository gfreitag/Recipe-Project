Title: Deviled Smelt
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 4 servings
12 oz Smelt, thawed if frozen
1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 ts Dry mustard
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Paprika
1    Finely grated lemon peel
Vegetable oil for frying
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
Lemon wedges
Lemon peel strips (opt)
Fresh dill sprig (opt)
Rinse smelt under cold running water. Pat dry on paper towels.

In a plastic bag, combine flour, salt, mustard, cayenne pepper,
paprika and lemon peel. Add smelt and shake well until fish are
evenly coated. Half fill a deep-fat fryer or saucepan with oil; heat
to 375'F. (190'C.) or until a 1/2" cube of day-old bread browns in 40
seconds.

Place 1/2 of smelt in a frying basket. Lower basket gradually into
hot oil and fry 1 minute, shaking basket frequently. Drain on paper
towels. Reheat oil to 375'F. (190'C.). Repeat with remaining smelt.
Place all of smelt into basket and fry 1-2 minutes more or until
lightly golden and crisp. Drain on paper towels. Turn into a warm
serving dish, sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve hot with lemon
wedges. Garnish with lemon peel strips and dill sprigs, if desired.
