Title: Spice Tea Wafers
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 65 servings
1/2 c  Plus 1 Tb warm, very strong
Brewed spice tea
2 tb Honey
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/8 ts Baking soda
4 tb (1/2 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
"These crispy, subtle crackers capture the flavor of your favorite
spice tea. 325~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.

Dissolve the honey in the warm tea.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, mix the flour and baking
soda together. Cut the butter into the flour mixture until it
resembles coarse meal. Slowly mix in about 1/2 cup of the tea-honey
mixture, just enough to form a dough that will hold together in a
cohesive ball. Reserve the remaining tea to glaze the tops of the
crackers.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch thick. With a sharp
knife, cut the dough into 2-inch shapes.

Place the crackers on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
sheet. Prick each one all the way through in 2 or 3 places with the
tines of a fork. Bake for 10 minutes, turn and brush the tops with
the remaining tea-honey liquid. Continue baking for another 10 to 15
minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 60-65.

VARIATION: Using a smoky tea such as Darjeeling also produces an
interesting cracker.
