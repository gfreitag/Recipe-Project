leadership hopefulls. Paul Martin's Rhubarb Meringue Pie

To make pastry, sift flour and salt and cut in shortening until
mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add water and work with a fork until
mixture holds together. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 10
minutes. Roll pastry and fit into a 9-inch pie plate. Prick with a
fork and bake at 400F for 10 minutes.

For filling, sift sugar and flour together and add rhubarb. Cook
slowly until mixture thickens, stirring constantly. Stir in egg yolk
and cook 1 minute longer. Remove from heat and add orange juice, rind
and butter. Cool and pour into baked pastry shell.

Meringue: beat egg whites until frothy. Add sugar by the tablespoon,
beating until stiff. Add vanilla. Spread meringue over the pie and
return to 350F oven for 10-12 minutes, or until lightly browned.
