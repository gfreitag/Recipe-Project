To clean octopus, pull of tentacles, remove intestines and ink sac.
Cut out eyes and beak.  Remove skin and rinse well.  Place head and
tentacles in a pan over low heat until it turns deep pink and is
tender (about 45 to 60 minutes).  Drain and when cool enough to
handle strip off suckers from tentacles if desired.  Cut head and
tentacles into bite-sized pieces and place in a bowl.  Add garlic,
olive oil, vinegar, salt if necessary and pepper to taste.  Mix well,
cover and leave to marinate in refrigerator for 12 hours before
using.  Stir occasionally.

To serve, lift out of marinade, pile onto a dish, garnish with lemon
wedges and parsley.  Supply cocktail picks for your guests'
convenience.
