Categories: Candy
Yield: 26 servings
-Robbie Shelton
2    Envelopes Unflavored
-Gelatin
2 tb -Cold Water
1/2 c  -Boiling Water
2 c  Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Vanilla
Flour
3/4 lb Chocolate for dipping
Regal Icing
Put gelatin in top of double boiler; add cold water.  When gelatin
softens, add boiling water and stil well.  Add sugar and salt.  Put
over boiling water and stir until sugar dissolves completely.

Pour into large bowl of electric mixer and beat at high speed until
misture is thick but not as stiff as beaten egg whites.  Add vanilla.

Meanwhile, spread flour 2" deep in a large pan.  Push an egg (in
shell) into the flour  at intervals, making hollow spaces in which to
mold the marshmallow mixture.

Drop marshmallow mixture into the flour molds.  Sprinkle flour
lightly over top and put in cold place until set.  Remove mixture
from one mold and you have a  half-egg.  Trim the flat side of
marshmallow half-egg to make it even.  You can dip it in melted
chocolate to cover and decorate with Regal Icing.

Or you can put two halves together to make an egg, as follows:  Dip
the rounded part of a half-egg in melted chocolate; set aside to
cool, flat (uncoated) side down.  Trim flat side of second half-egg
(to make it even), lift from mold and completely coat with chocolate.
Quickly press its flat side against the flat side of the cooled
half-egg and you have a whole egg. The chocolate will hold it
together.

When chocolate-coated eggs are cool, trim with Regal Icing put
through cake decorator tube.  Make ruffles around them to cover seam
where the two halves join and to provide decoration.  Write names of
children on their eggs with the icing, or decorate with tiny designs
pressed through fine tips of a cake decorator tube.  Frosting my be
left white or tinted in pastel colors.  Makes 13 eggs (or 26
half-eggs).
