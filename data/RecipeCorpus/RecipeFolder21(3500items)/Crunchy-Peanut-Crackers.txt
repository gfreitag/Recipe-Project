"Chopped whole peanuts and lots of peanut butter provide rich, nutty
flavor. Corn meal adds a little extra crunch. Kids will love Crunchy
Peanut Crackers spread with grape jelly alongside a glass of cold
milk for a healthy snack. 350~F. 15 to 20 minutes Preheat the oven to
350~F.

If you have a food processor, combine the flour, corn meal, peanuts,
salt and sugar and pulse until the peanuts are finely chopped, about
1 minute. Alternatively, chop the peanuts by hand and mix them
together with the flour, cornmeal, salt, and sugar in a large bowl.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk and peanut butter until
smooth. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and blend to form a
dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll each portion into a rectangle
approximately 3/16 to 1/4 inch thick. This dough is very crumbly. If
it cracks during rolling, simply press it back together with your
fingers.

With a sharp knife or cookie cutter, cut the dough into squares or
desired shapes about 2 inches across and place them on an ungreased
baking sheet. Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a
fork. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the crackers are a deep golden
brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 55-60.
