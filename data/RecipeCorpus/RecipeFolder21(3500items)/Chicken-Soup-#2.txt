Title: Chicken Soup #2
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings
2    Whole chickens cut up
2    Chopped medium onions
2 c  Sliced celery
4 c  Sliced carrots
2 qt Chopped tomatos
1 sm Head cabbage shredded
8    Potatoes peeled and chopped
4    Chicken bouillon cubes
1    Bay leaf
Salt and pepper to taste
1 ts Marjoram
2 ts Basil
1 ts Thyme
2 tb Chopped parsley
1 1/2 lb Spaghetti broken
Into pieces
Wash chicken pieces and place in large stockpot. Cover with water and
bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken falls off the
bones (approximately 2-3 hours). Remove chicken with slotted spoon
and let cool. When cool enough to handle, remove bones and skin and
cut all chicken up in small pieces, being careful not to leave any
bones. Add chicken to stock left in pan and refrigerate overnight.
When you remove pot from refrigerator, skim off the grease from the
top of the stock ( the chicken will be very moist from having
remained in the stock overnight). Return pot to heat and slowly bring
to boil. Add onions, celery, carrots, tomatos, cabbage and potatoes.
Add bouillon, bay leaf, salt and pepper, marjoram, basil, thyme and
parsley and simmer until vegetables are done to your liking. Then add
broken pieces of spaghetti and cook until tender. The soup will be
very thick, almost stew-like. It freezes well.
