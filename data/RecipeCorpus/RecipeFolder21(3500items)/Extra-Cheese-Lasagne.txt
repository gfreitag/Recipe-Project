Prepare the pasta dough according to recipe directions.Cut into strips

scraps and reroll the dough to make enough noodles.This recipe should
work out exactly if you roll your dough thin. Combine the
ricotta,garlic,spinach,egg and salt.Mix well by hand or in food
processor. To assemble the lasagne,pour a little bit of sauce in the
bottom of a 9 x 13" baking dish.Cover with a layer of noodles,then
layer of sauce.Sprinkle a layer of provolone,a layer of
mozzarella,then a layer of Parmesan.Cover with a layer of
noodles,then sauce,then the ricotta cheese mixture.Top with a layer
of noodles,sauce and the grated cheeses. Finish with a layer of
noodles,sauce and grated cheese. Cover the lasagne lightly(if you are
using aluminum foil,make a tent with the foil so it doesn't touch the
top of the lasagne). Bake for 1 hour @ 350 degrees.Remove the cover
and bake for an additional 30 minutes.Allow the lasagne to set 10
minutes before serving.This lasagne will be quite firm and can be
served in tidy- looking squares.Serves 6 generously.
