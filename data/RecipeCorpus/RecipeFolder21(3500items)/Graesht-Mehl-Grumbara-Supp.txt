Really Schmecks" GRAESHT MEHL GRUMBARA SUPP (Brown Flour Potato Soup)
~- a real Old Mennonite Soup.

Pell and cut the potatoes in slices. Boil them in salted water until
tender. Add the milk and let simmer. Meanwhile brown the flour in the
melted butter, stirring all the time at low heat; add it to the soup,
keep stirring till the mixture thickens. Sprinkle with parsley and
pepper and serve with buttered crumbs, or squares of fried bread, or
pretzels on top. You might boil some sliced onion with the potatoes,
if you like.
