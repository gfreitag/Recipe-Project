Mushrooms- find the biggest ones you can. Gently remove stems and
soak in warm water with juice of 1/2 lemon. Sausages- 1 per 6 lg
mushroom caps- remove the meat from the casing. Saute in a pan and
break up the meat as it browns. When slightly browned add the
mushroom stems (chopped) Saute until sausage is just about cooked.
Drain well in a strainer In a large bowl add bread crumbs, sausage
and mushroom mixture and any other spices you like. Add just enough
olive oil to make a sandy mixture. Fill mushroom caps and place on
baking pan. Bake 20 min at 375-400. Serve hot for hors d'oeuvres or a
veggie at dinner.
