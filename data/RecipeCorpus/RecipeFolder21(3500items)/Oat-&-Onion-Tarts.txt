Title: Oat & Onion Tarts
Categories: Main dish, British, Pie/tart
Yield: 24 servings
MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE PASTRY----------------------------
5 oz Oat flakes (rolled oats) *
2 1/2 oz Wholemeal flour
2 1/2 oz Plain white flour
2 1/2 oz Butter
2 1/2 oz Lard
2 1/2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
Paprika & cayenne pepper
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FILLING---------------------------
1 lb Onions
1/4 pt Soured cream
2 1/2 oz Butter
2 1/2 oz Cheddar cheese
1    Whole egg
1    Egg yolk
*Note: Medium oatmeal may be used instead of oat flakes if preferred.

Mix the oats, flours, cheese and a pinch each of salt, paprika and
cayenne. Cut then rub in the fat, bind with water and leave out to
rest.

Peel, quarter and slice the onions wafer thin.  Turn them in melted
butter, cover and leave to sweat over very gentle heat for 20 minutes
or so until meltingly tender, just stirring occasionally.

This pastry is rather difficult to handle so it is best to divide it
in half and roll out in two batches.  Keep the other half covered
meanwhile. Use the pastry to line little mincepie tins (or individual
4-inch fluted flan tins if you prefer).  Don't worry too much if the
pastry tears; patch it together by pressing it with your fingertips.
Blind bake on a pre-heated baking sheet at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6,
allowing 12 minutes with greaseproof paper and beans, then 12 minutes
without the lining.

When the onions are beautifully soft, remove the lid and cook over
increased heat for several minutes until they are a rich golden brown.
Season generously with salt and black pepper, add a dash of cayenne
and paprika and mix well.  Then tip the contents of the pan into a
sieve placed over a bowl to drain off the buttery juices and to cool
the onions slightly.  When the pastry cases are cooked, beat the eggs
with the soured cream, add onions and check seasoning.  Spoon the
mixture into the tarts, sprinkle the grated cheese on top and bake at
400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for 20-25 minutes until the filling is
deliciously puffed up and golden.
