Title: Frying Pan Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 36 servings
2    Eggs, unbeaten
1 c  Sugar*
1 1/2 c  Dates, chopped
Salt
Servings: 36

Cook over a low heat for 10 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from
stove and add 2 cups of Rice Krispies.

Roll in balls and dip in coconut.

*Would recommend from nil to 1/2 c sugar.  Dates, coconut and Rice
Krispies supply sufficient sweetener in my opinion.
