Title: Crisp Split Peas
Categories: Appetizer, Snack, Vegetable, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Yellow split peas
2 ts Baking soda
Vegetable oil
-- for deep-frying
1/2 ts Chili powder
1/2 ts Ground coriander
1 pn Ground cinnamon
1 pn Ground cloves
1 ts Salt
Rinse and sort the peas, then place in a large bowl and add enough
cold water to cover.  Stir in baking soda.  Let soak overnight.

Drain peas, rinse several times in cold water and drain thoroughly.
Let stand at least 30 minutes, then spread out on paper towels and
let dry thoroughly.  In a deep, heavy saucepan, heat about 2 inches
of oil to 350 F (180 C) or until a 1-inch bread cube turns golden
brown in about 65 seconds.  Add peas, a portion at a time, and cook
until golden.  (Be careful when cooking peas; even when completely
dry, they often cause oil to bubble to top of pan.)  Remove peas from
hot oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Turn cooked peas into a small bowl.  Sprinkle with chili powder,
coriander, cinnamon, cloves and salt; mix to coat peas with spice
mixture. Cool completely; store in an airtight container until ready
to serve.

Makes about 1-3/4 cups.
