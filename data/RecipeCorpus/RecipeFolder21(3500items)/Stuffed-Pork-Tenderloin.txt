Title: Stuffed Pork Tenderloin
Categories: Pork, Stuffing, Meat
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 lb Tenderloin, pork
2 tb Butter
1 c  Mushrooms, chopped
1 sm Italian sausage
2 tb Parsley, chopped fine
1/2 ts Thyme
1    Egg yolk, beaten
2    Bacon slices
1/4 c  Dry white wine
1. Preheat the oven to 375. 2. Lay the pork tenderloin on chopping
board and trim off almost all the fat. Score 2 vertical lines down
the lenght of it, taking care not to pierce through the meat. Place
the pork between to pieces of plastic wrap and pound the meat lightly
with a flat mallet so that it forms a shape somewhere between an oval
and a rectangle. 3. Melt 1 tbsp of butter in a saucepan and add the
mushrooms. Cook for 2-3 min. until soft. 4. Remove the sausage meat
from its casing and put it into a small mixing bowl. Add the
mushrooms, parsley and thyme and blend well. Stir in the egg to bind.
5. Spoon the sausage meat mixture down the center of the pork. Fold
over the 2 end flaps of the pork and then the sides to form a roll.
Place the slices of bacon on top. Tie the roll in 2 or 3 places with
string. 6. Place the roll on a sheet of foil and dot the remaining
butter on top. Wrap the foil around the pork roll and set on a baking
sheet. 7. Cook for 30 min. Remove the foil, baste the pork with the
cooking juices and cook for a further 10 min. 8. Remove and discard
the string and bacon. Cut the meat into slices crosswise. Pour the
cooking juices into a small saucepan, add the wine and bring to a
boil. Serve this sauce with the pork.
