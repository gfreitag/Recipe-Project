Chimichangas are deep-fried burritos.  the beef filling here can be
used in reg. burritos, empanadas, or tacos.

In heqvy saucepan, heat the oil.  Add the chili powder and garlic and
cook until the chili powder foams, abt. 2 min.   Add water to cover,
the cinnamon stick, oregano, allspice, salt, and pepper.  Simer until
the meat is very tender, abt. 2 hrs. Cover the pot for the 1st hr. of
cooking, then remove the cover and let the cooking liquid reduce.
The meat should be tender enough so that  you can easily shred it
with a fork.  Heat the oil in a deep pot to 350 F.  While the oil
heats, roll the chimichangas. First steam the tortillas over boiling
water for abt. 1 min. This soften the tortillas and makes them easy
to handle.  Fill each tortilla with abt. 3 tbs. of shredded meat.
Spoon abt. 1 tsp. of the salsa on the meat, and top with abt. 1 tb.
of sour cream.  Roll the tortilla as you would an eggroll and secure
with 2 toothpicks.  When oil is hot, fry the rolled tortillas, 1 at a
time, for abt 2 min. ea.  Drain and serve at once.  Pass extra salsa
and sour cream.  Recipe doubles, triples, etc. easily. ten
