4 lb Pork shoulder butt with

2    Pork neck bones
Salt and pepper to taste
1 md Onion
4 cn (15-oz each) white hominy
1 tb Chile rojo powder

Fill large soup pot or kettle (dutch oven) about half full with cold
water. Cur pork into 1-2 inch chunks and place in pot along with neck
bones, salt and pepper. Cut onion in half and add to pot. Bring to a
boil and cook at medium-low heat until the meat falls off the bones
(about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.) Remove bones. At this point, you may cool
down the meat and stock, then refrigerate overnight to congeal fat.
Trim away all possible fat and proceed. Add hominy and chile rojo and
bring soup to a final boil, then simmer about 20 minutes, skimming
off any foam. Serve in deep bowls, garnish, if desired, with onions,
radishes and cabbage. Pass the Tabasco or salsa.
