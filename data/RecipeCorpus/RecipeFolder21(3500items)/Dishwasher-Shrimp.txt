Title: Dishwasher Shrimp
Categories: Seafood
Yield: 5 servings
20    Jumbo shrimp
1    Onion (sliced)
2    Lemons (sliced)
1 tb Salt
1 tb Freshly ground pepper
1 tb Paprika
2 cl Garlic (chopped)
Make sure your dishwasher is clean. Prepare 4 double layers of heavy
duty aluminum large enough to wrap shrimp and spices airtight.
Arrange 2 slices of onion on each foil, then 5 shrimp. Distribute
salt, pepper, paprika, and chopped garlic evenly among the 4 shrimp
servings. Place 2 lemon slices on each serving and distribute juice
of second lemon evenly among the four servings. Wrap servings
tightly, folding edges as you would a package. Load packages on top
shelf of dishwasher. Run through rinse cycle. When cycle is finished,
you will have steamed shrimp and amazed guests.

This recipe is more than delicious. It is fun and it will amaze your
guests. You can adapt the recipe, using white fish filets and various
vegetables such as tomatos and zucchini. Caution: Make certain foil
packages are wrapped tightly and that your dishwasher is cleaned of
soap residue. (This paragraph is also from the cookbook).
