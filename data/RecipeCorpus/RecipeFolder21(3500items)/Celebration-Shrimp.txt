Contributed to the echo by: Janice Norman CELEBRATION SHRIMP In a
frying pan, combine the garlic and butter over medium heat until the
butter is melted. Place the shrimp and mushrooms in the pan and saute
until shrimp is done, turning the shrimp and mushrooms occasionally.

Put the hot fettucine noodles on each plate. Top with a serving of
shrimp and mushrooms, leaving the butter/garlic mixture in the pan.
Pour the lemon juice over the butter/garlic mixture and heat,
stirring for 1-2 minutes. Pour the butter/garlic mixture over the
fettucine.

Shake the grated cheese over each serving (we let everyone do his/her
own) and serve.
