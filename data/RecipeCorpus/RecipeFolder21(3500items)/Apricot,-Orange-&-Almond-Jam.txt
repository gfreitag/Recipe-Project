Title: Apricot, Orange & Almond Jam
Categories: Fruit, British
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Dried apricots
2 oz Split almonds
3    Oranges
2    Lemons
2 1/2 lb Sugar
2 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
Chop the apricots roughly.  Put them into a large bowl, sprinkling
the fine grated zest of the oranges and the cinnamon between layers.
Squeeze the juice of the oranges, measure and add enough water to
make 3 pints in all. Pour the liquids over the fruit and leave to
soak overnight in a cool place.

Slide the contents of the bowl into a preserving pan and simmer gently
until the fruit is beautifully tender.  Check the fruit occasionally
as it cooks and crush it down into the pan with a potato masher.  It
may need 1-1/4 hours to become really soft.

Warm the sugar.  Add it to the pan together with the juice of the
lemons and the almonds.  Cook gently until the sugar is melted, then
fast-boil until the saucer test shows that the preserve will set.
Pot, tie down and label the preserve in the usual way.  Makes enough
to fill 5 jars.
