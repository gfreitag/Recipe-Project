The day before you wish to serve the soup, fry the bacon until crisp
and remove. In bacon drippings, saute onion, celery with leaves and
potatoes for 10-15 minutes at medium heat. Add the minced clams, not
clam soup but clams, with their juice. Crumble the bacon and add.
Cover soup and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, for
several hours - up to five hours won't hurt. Cool down and place in
refrigerator at night. On the day of serving, skim grease off top.
Transfer soup to larger pot. Heat soup until bubbling and add the
seafood seasoning. Mix 2 cups of the half and half with the flour.
Add to the chowder and stir until it bubbles again. Mix in remaining
half and half and simmer, stirring constantly, until soup is desired
thickness. Serve hot with garlic bread and a green salad.
