Categories: Italian, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Vegetable oil
1 sm Onion, diced
28 oz Can tomatoes
6 oz Can tomato paste
2 ts Brown sugar
1 1/2 ts Oregano leaves
Salt and pepper to taste
12 oz Pkg. jumbo macaroni shells
20 oz Frozen creamed spinach in
Boiling bags
15 oz Container ricotta cheese
8 oz Shredded mozzarella cheese
In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat oil and cook onion until
tender, stirring often. Add tomatoes(chopped or squished with your
hands) with their liquid, tomato paste, brown sugar, oregano (oops I
just realised I forgot-1 clove garlic, minced), garlic, 1 1/2 t. salt
and 1/4 t. pepper (or to taste). Heat to boiling; then reduce heat to
low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, prepare macaroni
shells as label directs; pour into collander and cool slightly.
Prepare spinach as label directs, pour into bowl and cool (again)
slightly. Stir in ricotta and mozzarella (I also add 1/4 c.
parmagian), 1 t. salt and 1/4 t. pepper. Fill each cooked shell with
about 1 T.  cheese mixture.  Preheat oven to 350. Spoon sauce evenly
into 14"X10" (or 13"X9") roasting pan, arrange filled shells in
sauce. Cover roasting pan with foil and bake 30 minutes or until hot
and bubbly.
