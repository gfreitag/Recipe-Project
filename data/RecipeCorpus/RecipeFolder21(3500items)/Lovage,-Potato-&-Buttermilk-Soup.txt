Title: Lovage, Potato & Buttermilk Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, British
Yield: 6 servings
2 1/2 oz Finely chopped onion
10 oz Corsely grated raw potato
Fresh young lovage leaves
1 1/4 pt Chicken or vegetable stock
1/2 pt Buttermilk, more if desired
Put the onion into a heavy-based saucepan.  Add the stock and bring to
boiling point very slowly so the onion begins to soften a little.

Meanwhile coarsely chop a small handful (5 or so tablespoons) of
lovage. Add the potato and herbs to the pan and pour on 1/2 pint
buttermilk. Increase the heat very slightly and bring the mixture to
a bare simmer. Stir vigorously all the while as the potato starch
will thicken the soup, which may stick to the pan base.  Half-cover
the pan and reduce heat as low as possible once again.  Cook very
gently indeed, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are
perfectly tender.

Whizz the contents of the pan to a smooth puree.  Season with salt and
pepper and with extra lovage if you like.  Whizz again and thin to
taste with a little more stock or buttermilk.  Reheat gently or chill
thoroughly before serving, then garnish with a swirl of buttermilk
and a small flotilla of chopped fresh lovage.
