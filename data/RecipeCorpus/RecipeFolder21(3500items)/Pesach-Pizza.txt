I make a great Pesach Pizza. Beat eggs , farfel and a little salt
like you would do for matzo brei. Spread on the bottom of a pan. I
get a round aluminum pizza pan. Bake till set, about 25 min. Remove
from oven, Spoon tomato sauce over the crust and sprinke shredded
cheese and garlic powder on top. Return to oven till cheese melts. I
even cut it into triangles like the real thing. Did you by any chance
used to live in Clifton, NJ when you were a child. There was a Rabbi
Lerer who used to come to our shul and I think he had a son with your
name. I have found 3 people over prodigy who are related to people in
Passaic. It's a small world.
