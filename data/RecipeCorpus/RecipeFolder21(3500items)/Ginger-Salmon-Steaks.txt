ABOUT 30 MINUTES BEFORE SERVING:

Slice the ginger root and green onion into 2-inch long,
matchstick-thin, strips.  Arrange the arugula on a platter.  In a
10-inch skillet over medium-high heat in 1-inch of hot oil, cook the
ginger root and green onion until lightly browned.  With a slotted
spoon, remove the ginger root mixture to a small bowl and set aside.
In the remaining oil in the skillet, cook the salmon steaks, turning
once, until browned and the fish flakes easily when tested with a
fork, about 10 minutes.  Place the salmon steaks on top of the
arugula.  Discard any remaining oil in the skillet, then stir in the
sherry, sow sauce, and 2 Tb of water, blending well and heating
through.  Pour the sherry mixture over the salmon steaks and sprinkle
the ginger root mixture on top of the steaks.  While the salmon
steaks are cooking, in a 3-quart saucepan, heat 2 ts of salad oil and
cook the cherry tomatoes until just heated through.  Cut 1 heart
shape out of each slice of bread and toast the hearts.  (Save the
trimmings for bread crumbs to be used another day.)  Serve the Salmon
Steaks with the toasted hearts and cooked cherry tomatoes.
