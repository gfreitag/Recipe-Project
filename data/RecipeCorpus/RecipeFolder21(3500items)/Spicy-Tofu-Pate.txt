Title: Spicy Tofu Pate
Categories: Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Tofu (fresh)
1/4 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 c  Cornmeal
1/2 c  Wheat germ
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
2 tb Soy sauce
1 ts Molasses
1/2 ts Ground fennel
1    Garlic clove; -OR-
2 ts -Garlic powder
1/4 ts Savory
1/4 ts Powdered sage
1/2 ts Allspice
2 ts Oregano
2 ts Dijon mustard, more to taste
-(or any prepared mustard)
Mash tofu in a large bowl. Add remaining ingredients, mix well with
fork or by hand. Pack into small oiled casserole dish; cover with two
or three paper towels. Steam 25 to 35 minutes on a rack inside a
covered pot with water on stove or in a pan of water in the oven at
375 degrees. Top will brown slightly. Cool before removing from dish.
Steaming blends flavors. Stores up to two weeks in fridge. Makes 2.5
cups.

JTK's notes: I accidently used wheat bran instead of germ, and it
still worked (kind of dry, though). I made this in a 2-qt. porcelain
souffle dish, which it filled approx. 2/3. I didn't have savory so I
substituted fresh thyme. As usual, I added more garlic & hot sauce.
Mash tofu very well, or you will have lots of tofu lumps --- I think
I might try blending this in the food processor next time, to avoid
this problem. This was enough for maybe 4 days of lunches for me
(pate on 4-5 Wasa breads/rice cakes per day).
