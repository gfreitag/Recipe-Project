Categories: Italian, Pasta, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1 lg Bunch broccoli, trimmed
And cut into flowerettes
1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil
1/2 c  (1 stick) unsalted butter
6 lg Garlic cloves, sliced
Paper thin
2 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
1 lb Large shell macaroni,
Cooked
Cook broccoli to desired tenderness in lightly salted boiling water.
RESERVE 1 CUP of BROCCOLI COOKING WATER.  Drain remaining water from
broccoli and cut into bite-size chunks; set aside.

In a medium size saucepan; heat olive oil over medium, add garlic
slices and stir until lightly and evenly browned.  (At this point,
you can remove and dicard the garlic, but I always leave it in!) Add
the butter, stirring until melted.  Add red pepper flakes and simmer
3 minutes. Add the reserved broccoli water and simmer another minute.
Turn off heat and stir in broccoli.  Cover and set aside while
cooking pasta.

Place cooked pasta into large bowl.  Pour broccoli sauce over pasta.
Toss to coat and serve with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and black
pepper.  YUM.
