"Why not bake a batch of cracker treats for your dog? These biscuits
seem to satisfy the discriminating canine palate. If you are wise,
you'll make a double recipe. 325~F. 40 to 50 minutes Preheat the oven
to 325~F.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flour, oatmeal,
cornmeal, liver powder, brewer's yeast, bone meal, and powdered milk.

Stir in the eggs, oil, and water and mix thoroughly. The dough will
be very stiff and dry.

Remove the dough to a lightly floured surface or pastry cloth. Roll
or pat it into a rectangle 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Cut into
bone-shaped biscuits with a small knife, or use a bone-shaped cookie
cutter. Re--roll the leftover scraps of dough and cut into shapes
until all the dough is used.

Place on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet and bake
for 40 to 50 minutes until brown and dried through. Cool on a rack.
Yield: About 12 large bones or 24 small ones.
