Make a white sauce by melting the butter in a double boiler, stirring
in the flour and adding the milk gradually. Cook, stirring constantly
to the thickened sauce. Add pepper and check for salt. Adjust if
necessary. We like it served over toasted English Muffins. This will
make enough sauce for about 6-8 muffin halves, depending on how
generous you are with the sauce.
