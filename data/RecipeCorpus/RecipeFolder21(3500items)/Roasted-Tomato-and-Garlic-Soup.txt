Title: Roasted Tomato and Garlic Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 8 servings
1 T  Roasted Garlic (see recipe)
8    Medium tomatoes
2 t  Olive oil
3 T  Flour (all-purpose)
1    Large onion, chopped--about
1 1/2 cups
2    14 oz. cans clear veg. broth
1 c  Skim milk
1/2 t  Ground thyme
1/2 t  Sugar
1/2 t  Salt
1/4 t  White pepper
Heat the oven to broil.  Slice the tomatoes in half and squeeze out
the seeds and juice.  Place skin side up on a jellyroll pan.  Broil
for 10 minutes, or until skins blister and blacken.  Remove from oven
and allow to cool slightly.  Skins will slip off easily; discard.
Place the tomatoes in a food processor or blender and puree.

In a Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat.  Satue the onions
until soft, then sprinkle evenly with flour.  Stir with a whisk and
cook for 1 minute longer.  Stir in the tomato puree and vegetable
broth and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture comes to a
boil.  Add the roasted garlic, thyme, white pepper, salt and sugar.
Simmer for 10 to 20 minutes.
Turn off heat and stir in the reserved milk.  Makes 8 (1-cup)
servings. From the Orlando Sentinel.
