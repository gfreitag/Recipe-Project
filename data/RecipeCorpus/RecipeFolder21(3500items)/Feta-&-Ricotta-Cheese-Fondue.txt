COOKING Feta and Ricotta Cheese Fondue

Melt the butter in a heavy 8-inch skillet or a 1 quart saucepan over
low-heat. Add the feta and ricotta cheese, and pepper. Cook, stirring
constantly, and mashing the cheeses slightly, until they soften and
begin to bubble - about 5 minutes.

Stir in lemon juice, and garnish with the parsley if desired. Serve at
once; as the fondue cools, it loses flavor. VARIATIONS: Substitute
Fontina cheese for the Feta Cheese or you can substitute cottage
cheese for the ricotta. You can make both of these substitutions.
