Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Corn oil
1 sm Onion, finely chopped
1    Garlic clove, crushed
1/2 ts Hot chili powder
1 1/2 ts Curry Powder
1 1/4 c  Water
2/3 c  Crunchy peanut butter
1 ts Light brown sugar
2 ts Dark soy sauce
1 ts Lemon juice
Salt to taste
Fresh ground pepper to taste
1 lb Boneless sirloin steak
Lemon pieces (opt)
Fresh cilantro sprigs (opt)
To make peanut sauce, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a saucepan. Add
onion and garlic and fry gently until golden.

Stir in chili powder, Curry Powder, water, peanut butter and brown
sugar. Bring to a boil; simmer gently until thickened. Stir in soy
sauce and lemon juice, then salt and pepper. Turn mixture into a
serving dish.

Preheat broiler. Grease a broiler pan. Trim and cut meat in 1/2"
cubes. Thread (not too tightly) onto 8 bamboo skewers, leaving a
space at each end for holding. Cover ends with small pieces of foil
to prevent burning. Place skewers in greased broiler pan. Brush with
remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Cook under preheated broiler 10-15
minutes until golden and cooked through. Turn and brush frequently
with oil during cooking. Garnish with lemon pieces and cilantro
sprigs, if desired, and serve hot with peanut sauce.
