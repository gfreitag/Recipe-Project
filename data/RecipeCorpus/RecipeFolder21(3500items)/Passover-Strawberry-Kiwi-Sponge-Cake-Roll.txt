To make sponge cake roll: preheat oven to 350.F. Grease a 10x15"
jelly roll pan. Cover with greased wax paper. In a large bowl; beat
the egg whites with an elec. mixer at high speed until soft peaks
form. Gradually add 1/3 c. of granulated sugar, beating until stiff
peaks form. In a small bowl, beat egg yolks with an electric mixer at
high speed until thick and lemon-colored (about 5 minutes.) Gradually
add the remaining 1/3 cup of sugar, beating constantly. Stir in lemon
juice. Gently fold the egg-yolk mixture into the egg-white mixture.
Sift together potato starch, matzo cake meal and salt. Gently fold
the dry ingredients, half at a time, into the egg mixture until just
blended. Spread batter evenly in jelly-roll pan and bake 15 minutes
or until cake tests done (wooden toothpick inserted in center will
come out clean.) Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Turn
out of pan onto a clean,cotton kitchen towel that has been sprinkled
generously with 1/3 c. Confectioners sugar. Roll up the cake and
twirl together from the long end. Let cool completely. Refrigerate
(rolled up) while you prepare filling.

To make fruit filling: Place 1 c. non-dairy topping in a bowl
(reserve 1 c. for icing) and fold in sliced strawberries and kiwi.

To assemble: Unroll sponge cake and spread fruit-cream filling evenly
over cake. Roll cake very carefully and place on ungreased cookie
sheet, seam side down. Cover with clear wrap and refrigerate. Just
before serving, ice to and sides of filled cake with reserved
topping. Garnish with sliced kiwi, whole strawberries and mint leaves.
