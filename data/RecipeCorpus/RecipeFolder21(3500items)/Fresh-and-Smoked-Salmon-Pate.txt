Whish together heavy cream and sour cream in small bowl. Refrigerate.
Combine cold water, carrot, onion, bay leaf, lemon slices and chili
pepper in skillet large enough to hold the salmon fillets in one
layer. Bring to boiling; continue to boil 10 minutes. Lower to
simmer. Add salmon, skin side up. Simmer very gently over medium low
heat until salmon is just cooked, about 10 minutes. Do not overcook.
Remove salmon from poaching liquid; remove and discard skin. Cool
completely. Saute shallots in the 1 1/2 tablespoon butter in small
skillet over medium heat, stirring, until golden, about 5 minutes.
Transfer to bowl of food processor. Add salmon, smoked salmon and
cream mixture to food processor. Puree until smooth. With processor
running, add remaining 1/2 cup butter, bit by bit, until smooth. Add
lemon juice, salt and pepper. Fold in dill. Spoon mixture into 4 cup
souffle dish or decorative serving dish. Smooth top with rubber
spatula. Garnish with a few fresh dill sprigs, and a whole bay leaf
and small sweet red pepper strips, if you wish. Pour clarified butter
over top of pate to cover completely. Refrigerate 4 hours to set
pate. NOTE: To clarify butter, melt 6 tablespoon butter in saucepan
over medium heat. Remove from heat; skim off foam from top. With
small ladle, spoon clear liquid butter into a dish, leaving milky
solids behind. Discard milky solids. Use clear butter.
