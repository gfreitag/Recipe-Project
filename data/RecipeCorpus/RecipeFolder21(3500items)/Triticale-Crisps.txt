Title: Triticale Crisps
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 75 servings
1/2 c  Cracked wheat, soaked in
Warm water for 5 to 10
Minutes and drained well
1 1/2 c  Triticale flour
1/4 ts Salt
3 tb Oil

"This simple cracker provides a good way to taste the complex flavor
of triticale. The cracked wheat adds texture and crunch. Add a few of
these crackers and some sliced Swiss cheese to your family's lunch
pails. 350~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.

Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl or in the food processor.
Blend in the oil until mixture resembles coarse meal.

Add the cracked wheat and mix well. Slowly stir in enough of the
water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch. With a sharp knife or
a cookie cutter, cut the dough into desired 2-inch shapes.

Place on an ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 20 to
25 minutes, turning over after 10 minutes. Make sure these crackers
get medium brown to bring out their flavor. Cool on a rack. Yield:
60-75.

VARIATION: For a more delicate cracker, roll the dough thinner, to
1/16 inch, and reduce the baking time slightly.
