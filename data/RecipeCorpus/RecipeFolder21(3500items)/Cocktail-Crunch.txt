Title: Cocktail Crunch
Categories: British, Snack, Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
3 oz Rye flakes
3 oz Jumbo oat flakes
3 oz Barley flakes
3 oz Wheat flakes
3 oz Peanut kernals
-- not salted or dry-roast
2 oz Flaked almonds
2 oz Sunflower seeds
1 ts (heaped) coriander seeds
1 ts (heaped) cumin seeds
1 tb Garam marsala
1 ts Tumeric
3 tb Sesame oil
3 tb Peanut oil
1 tb Soy sauce
5 tb Water
Crush the coriander and cumin - lightly.  Mix them with the nuts and
seeds on two baking trays.  Set the oven to 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5
and put the baking trays into the oven while it heats up.  Meanwhile
measure the flaked grains and mix them together in a large bowl.  Put
into a cup the garam marsala, tumeric, a good grinding of black
pepper, a scrunch of sea salt, the soy, both sorts of oil and the
water.

When the oven has reached the required temperature, stir the nut and
seed mixture with the flaked grains.  Beat the spicy oil-and-water
mixture with a fork to emulsify it, pour it on to the dry ingredients
and stir for 2 minutes.  Spread the mixture out on to the baking
trays and bake for 40 minutes until golden.  Swap the positions of
the trays in the oven at least once during this time and stir the
mixture occasionally to encourage even cooking.  Let the mixture
become cold and crunchy before storing in an airtight jar.  It keeps
well for about a month.  Makes enough to fill one jar.
