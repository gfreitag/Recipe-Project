Title: Pasta Dough (Manual Pasta Machines Only)
Categories: Italian, Bread
Yield: 1 servings
2 1/3 c  All purpose flour
(for better pasta, use
1 1/3 c  AP flour and
1 c  Semolina flour)
2 lg Eggs
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 ts Salt
1/3 c  Water
Mix 2 cups flour and salt in bowl, reserve 1/3 cup for later. Make a
well in the center Mix eggs, olive oil and water and pour into well.
Stir flour into egg mixture until dough forms into a ball. Turn out
onto floured surface and kneed for about 10 minutes, adding extra
flour if too moist. Kneed until dough is smooth and elastic. Cover
with towel and rest for 30 minutes. Cut into 4 portions, keep pieces
covered until used.

Get out your machine and set dial on widest setting (1 on the Atlas).
Flatten dough ball and run through rollers several times until smooth
(you may add a bit of flour here too). Move rollers to next setting
and roll again once. Continue to roll until pasta is the proper
thickness (5 or 6 on the Atlas).  You may cut sheet in half if it's
too long. Continue with other pieces and then put the finished sheet
aside to dry for about 3 minutes.  Attach desired pasta cutters and
run the sheets through.

You can use right away or spread out the pasta to dry overnight and
then freeze extra.

To cook, drop into large pot of boiling water with a bit of salt and
oil. Cook until al dente, which should only take about 2 minutes for
fresh.

A tip - be sure the dough is fairly dry, otherwise it won't cut into
separate strands.

Another tip - You can substitute heavy cream for the 1/3 c water for a
richer pasta. Great for fettuchini alfredo.
