Title: Truites Au Bleu (Trout Cooked in Court Bouillon)
Categories: Fish
Yield: 4 servings
4    10-oz. trout
4 qt Water
1 c  White vinegar
1    Bay leaf
Salt to taste
10    Peppercorns
Lemon wedges
Melted butter or
Hollandaise Sauce
Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut off the fins from the back and
sides of the trout.  Leave the head and tail intact.
Using a long needle such as a trussing needle, run a string through
the eyes of the trout, then the tail.  Tie the head and tail
together. This is simply for appearance.  When trout are freshly
caught, they are killed and dressed and dropped into boiling water
immediately.  These trout will curve naturally through muscle and
nerve reaction.
Combine the water and vinegar in a fairly wide casserole.  There
should be enough liquid to cover the trout when they are added.  Add
the bay leaf, salt and peppercorns.  Bring to the boil and simmer for
10 minutes.
Drop the trout into simmering water.  Simmer for 5 minutes.  Drain
the trout and serve with lemon wedges and hot melted butter or
Hollandaise Sauce. The New New York Times Cookbook, by Craig
