Title: Baked Smoked Salmon & Feta Cheese En Croute
Categories: Fish, Main dish
Yield: 2 servings
3 oz Smoked salmon, diced
6 oz Cream cheese, softened
3 oz Feta cheese
1    Egg, slightly beaten
1 ts Capers
2 tb Finely choppedparsley
4    Scallions, topped, diced
1 tb (or more) poppyseeds
You'll also need 1 frozen pastry sheet, cut into a 3" X 8" rectangle
and some melted butter.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a medium
bowl, hand mix the salmon, cream cheese, Feta cheese, egg, capers,
parsle, and scallions.  Roll out the pastry sheet to double its size.
Liberally brush it with melted butter.  Spread the salmon mixture
over the sheet. Roll up, jelly-roll style, folding the ends in to
seal. Brush the top of the roll with melted butter and sprinkle with
poppy seeds. Make 1/2 inch deep diagonal slashes across the roll to
allow steam to escape. Bake the roll for 20 to 30 minutes or until
golden. Serve warm.
