Categories: Bread, Sourdough
Yield: 4 servings
3 c  Unbleached all-purpose
Flour, divided
1 ts Active dry yeast
2 c  Hot (120F to 130F) water
1 c  Lukewarm (100F) water
SOURDOUGH STARTER
Yield : Approximately 4 cups Difficulty: (one chocolate kiss, or easy)
Prepartion: 10 minutes Allow at least 4 days for the starter to
ferment before using. "Day 1: 1. In a medium bowl, stir together 2
cups of the flour and yeast.  Make a well in the middle of the
flour/yeast mixture and whisk in the hot water. Continue stirring
until the mixture is blended but not completely smooth. It is not
necessary to smooth out all the lumps; they will dissolve as the
mixture start to ferment. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and let
the mixture sit at room temperature. Over the next 24 hours the
mixture will rise, become very bubbly and then start to recede.

"Days 2 and 3: 2. Stir the mixture twice, once in the morning and
once in the evening to invigorate the yeast and to expel the alcohol.
Towards the end of the second day the mixture will start to thin and
the surface of the starter will be covered with lots of tiny air
bubbles. By the evening of the third day a thin layer of yellow-brown
liquid may form on the surface of the starter. It is simply the
alcohol given off by the yeast cells as they feed on the
carbohydrates in the flour and multiply. Refresh the starter by
stirring in the cup of lukewarm water (100F) and the remaining cup of
flour. Stir until blended, but do not worry about any small lumps.

"Day 4: 3. The starter is now ready to use, or it may be poured into a
sterilzed 2 quart glass or ceramic covered crock or casserole, or a
flass jar with a non-metal lid and refrigerated.
