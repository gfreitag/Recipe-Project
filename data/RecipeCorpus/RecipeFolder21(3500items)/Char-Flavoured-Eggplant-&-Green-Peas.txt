Title: Char Flavoured Eggplant & Green Peas
Categories: Main dish, Indian, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
1 md Eggplant, cut into 1" cubes
2 c  Fresh or frozen green peas
4 tb Ghee
1 tb Coarsely crushed coriander
1/2 tb Coarsely crushed cumin seeds
1 ts Turmeric
1 ts Salt
3 ea Whole hot chilies
1/8 ts Asafetida
3 ea Sprigs fresh coriander
2 c  Stock
Place eggplant into the bottom of a heavy pot.  Sprinkle in the fresh
peas, dot with ghee & add the remaining ingredients.  Bring the
liquid to a boil & cook for 4 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low,
partially cover & cook for about 30 minutes, shaking the pot from
time to time to prevent sticking. If the stock is evaporating too
quickly, add some more & reduce the heat. When almost all the stock
has evaporated, add the frozen peas (if you are using them instead of
fresh) reduce the heat further & fry until a crust has begun to form
on the bottom of the pot & the eggplant has begun to char.

Remove from the heat & let sit for 3 to 4 minutes.  Gently stir in the
crust & serve immediately.
