Categories: Asian
Yield: 4 servings
1/3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
4 ts Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
5 lg Eggs; beaten until frothy
1/2 lb Ground pork shoulder
6 md Scallions; trimmed
- sliced thin
- (include some green tops)
3 lg Garlic cloves
- peeled and minced
2 ts Oriental sesame oil
1/2 lb Tender young asparagus
-trimmed of coarse stem ends
- peeled and cut into
- moderately fine julienne
2 tb Vegetable oil
MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
1    1" cube ginger
- peeled and minced
1/3 c  Soy sauce
1 tb Cider vinegar
1 tb Mirin (sweet rice wine)
1 ts Hot sesame oil
SIFT THE FLOUR, SALT, PEPPER and 2 teaspoons of the sugar into a large
bowl. Make a well in the center and pour the eggs into it. Stir just
enough to combine the ingredients. In a medium skillet set over
moderate heat, stir-fry the pork, scallions, and two-thirds of the
garlic in the sesame oil for 8-to-10 minutes, until the pork is no
longer pink; do not brown the meat. Add the asparagus, toss for
1-or-2 minutes over moderate heat, then allow the mixture to cool to
room temperature. In a separate bowl, combine the remaining
ingredients, except the vegetable oil, to make a dipping sauce. When
the pork mixture is cool, stir it into the reserved batter. Heat the
vegetable oil in a large skillet over moderately high heat until
ripples show on the skillet bottom. Half fill a 1/4-cup measuring cup
with the batter and drop the batter into the hot oil, evening up the
ragged edges of the pancake. Add 3 more pancakes to the skillet,
smoothing the edges as before, and brown them for 1-to-1 1/2 minutes
per side. Drain them on paper towels, then keep them warm on an
uncovered platter in a 250F oven. Fry the rest of the pancakes,
adding more vegetable oil to the skillet if needed. Serve the
pancakes hot with the dipping sauce.
