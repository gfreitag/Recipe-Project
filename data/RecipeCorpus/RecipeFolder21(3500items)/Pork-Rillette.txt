Title: Pork Rillette
Categories: Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
1 lb Leftover chopped roast pork
1 ts Chopped parsley
1/4 ts Grated nutmeg
1/4 c  Chicken stock
1/3 c  Mined onion
1/4 ts Powdered mace
Salt and pepper
1/8 lb Butter softened optional
3 tb Melted butter
Put roast pork, parsley, nutmeg, stock, onion, mace, salt and pepper
in a heavy pot, cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes to heat through
and blend flavors. Pour contents of the pot into the bowl of your
food processor and process - using a pulsing action. Do not puree. If
the pork roast had a fair amount of fat, the butter may not be
necessary - use your own judgment. If butter seems needed because the
pork is very lean, stir in the softened butter at this point. Pour
into 3-4 small crocks. Refrigerate to cool. Melt butter and pour a
thin layer over the top of rillette in each crock. Refrigerate until
butter sets.
