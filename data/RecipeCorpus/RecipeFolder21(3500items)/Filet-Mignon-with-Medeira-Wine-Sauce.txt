over high heat for about 5 min. Cook longer if you want medium or
well done. 2. Turn the meat and continue cooking over high heat about
5 min. (or longer if meat is to be other then med-rare). Remove the
meat to a warm platter and keep warm. Pour off the fat from the
skillet. 3. Add the shallots and wine to the skillet and cook over

flour in a small mixing bowl. Stir into the simmering sauce and cook
briefly until thicken. 5. Swirl in the remaining tsp of butter.

a dab of parsley. Serve immediately.
