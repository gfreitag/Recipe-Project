Fresh bean sprouts are a must for this recipe from China's Hunan
province. The canned variety don't have the requisite crispness. Keep
a close eye on the toasting sesame seeds so they don't burn.

PREHEAT OVEN TO 300F. Toast the sesame seeds by spreading them over
the bottom of a pie tin. Roast for 12-to-16 minutes, stirring often,
until they are golden. The seeds can be toasted in advance and stored
in an airtight container. Place the bean sprouts in a large heatproof
bowl and set it aside. In a medium-size skillet set over moderately
low heat, stir-fry the garlic, scallions and ginger in the oil for 2
to 3 minutes, until they are limp. Add all the remaining ingredients,
increase the heat to moderate, then boil the mixture, uncovered, for
1 minute to slightly reduce the liquid. Pour the boiling dressing
over the bean sprouts, toss well, then cover the bowl and chill the
salad for several hours. Toss again before serving.
