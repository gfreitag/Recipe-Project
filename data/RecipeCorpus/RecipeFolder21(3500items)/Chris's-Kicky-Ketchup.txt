Chris's Kicky Ketchup Combine all ingredients in a blender. Pulse
until mixed thoroughly, but still leaving a few tiny chunks of solid
vegetables. Wash the label off the ketchup bottle, put your own label
on, and fill.

For the hot sauce, of course I used Melinda's. You could use Tabasco,
Louisiana Red Hot, or whatever you like. And, I used Wright's Hickory
Smoke flavoring.
