In a large pot, bring water to boil. Slice the eggplant in half and
scoop out the insides. Place the eggplant shells in the water and
cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Chop the eggplant insides and set
aside to saute.

In another saucepan, bring the quinoa and water to a boil, then
reduce the heat, cover, and cook until all the water is absorbed,
about 15 minutes.

In a large frying pan, add the water and heat over medium heat. Then
add the onion, garlic, peppers, and the eggplant insides, and saute,
adding a little more water as needed. Then add the tomato puree,
salt, pepper, walnuts, and chickpeas. Cover and simmer about 5
minutes, stirring occasionally.

Preheat oven to 350.

Turn off the heat for all three pans. Drain the eggplant shells from
the water. Add the cooked quinoa, wheat flour, and gluten flour to the
vegetable saute and stir well. Place the eggplant shells in a large
casserole dish with a cover. Fill the eggplant shells with the quinoa
mixture. Put the cover on the casserole dish, and place in the oven.
Bake at 350 for 1 hour. Serve with a steamed vegetable, such as
cauliflower, and a green salad, such as a spinach salad.
