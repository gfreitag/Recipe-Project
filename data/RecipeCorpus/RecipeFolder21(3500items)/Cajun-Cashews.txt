Title: Cajun Cashews
Categories: Cajun/creol, Appetizer
Yield: 2 servings
1 tb Unsalted Butter
2 ts White Vinegar Or
Red- Wine Vinegar
2 ts Tabasco Sauce
1 ts Cayenne Pepper
1/2 ts Garlic Salt
1/2 ts Salt
2 c  Unsalted Raw Cashews
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Line a jelly roll pan with a sheet of aluminum foil and set aside.

Place the butter, vinegar, tobasco sauce, cayenne pepper, garlic salt
and slat in a medium -size heavy saucepan over medium heat and stir
until the butter has melted and the seasonings are well incorporated.
Add the cashews and toss until they are well coated with the mixture.

Pour the nuts onto the prepared baking pan and spread so that they
are in a single layer.  Bake the nuts until dark golden brown, 10 to
15 minutes. Check the nuts after 10 minutes to make certain they are
not browning too quickly. When the nuts are done, remove them from
the oven and cool for 5 minutes.  Scrape the nuts and any dried
seasonings on the bottom of the pan into a mixing bowl, Toss well.

Serve the nuts warm or at room temperature. (Nuts may be made several
days in advance and stored in glass jars or other airtight
containers. Just the thing for football game days or other sports
days.)

As A Variation:  In addition to serving the cashews as an appetizer,
package them in decorative glass jars or tins and give them as
presents to good friends.
