Title: Creamy Whole-Wheat Crackers
Categories: Cracker
Yield: 50 servings
2 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1 1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Half-and-half or cream
Preheat the oven to 325~ F.

In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flour, sugar,
and salt. Slowly add the half-and-half or cream and blend to form a
dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll thin, at most 1/8 inch. The thinner
these crackers are, the better. Cut out individual 2-inch crackers
with a cookie cutter, juice can, or sharp knife and arrange on a
lightly greased or parchement-lined baking sheet.

With the tines of a fork, prick each cracker 2 or 3 times. Bake for
20 to 25 minutes, or until lightly browned, turning over once during
baking.

Cool the crackers on a rack until crisp. Yield: 45-50.

VARIATIONS: To vary the texture, substitute 1/2 cup rolled oats, rye,
barley, or wheat for an equal amount of flour.
