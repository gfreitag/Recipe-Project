Categories: Cracker

"A tasty and nutritious teething cracker, far superior to anything
you will find for sale at the supermarket. These make thoughtful
gifts for babies and their parents. For an alternative baby teething
cracker, try the Zwieback recipe on page 139. 325~F. 60 to 70 minutes
Preheat the oven to 325~F.

In the food processor or in a large bowl, stir together the flour,
corn meal, salt, and sugar. Add the egg and mix well. Blend in enough
of the milk to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive
ball.

On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll into a rectangle about 3/8
inch thick. With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 1-1/2- by 3-inch
rectangles. Place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
sheet. Prick each cracker 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 60 to 70 minutes, or until the crackers are thoroughly dry.
Cool on a rack. These crackers should be hard. If necessary, put them
back in the oven for a few extra minutes. Yield: 10-15.
