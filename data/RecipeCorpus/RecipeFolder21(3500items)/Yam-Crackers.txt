"A painless way to eat your vegetables, these crackers have a mellow
yam taste. Spread some sweet butter on a few and rest under a shade
tree, thinking of Thanksgivings past. 325~F. 25 to 30 minutes

Place the yam in a saucepan, cover with water, and boil until soft
(about 15 minutes). The tines of a fork should push easily into the
yam. Drain the yam. Puree the yam with 2 Tablespoons of water in the
blender or food processor, or puree it by hand with a fork or potato
masher. Measure out 1 cup of the puree for use in this recipe. Save
the rest for another use.

Preheat the oven to 325~F. In a large bowl or in the food processor,
combine the flour, salt, cinnamon, and sugar.

Cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal.
Add the pureed yam and blend well. Gather the dough into a ball. The
dough will be very soft. For easier rolling, wrap it in wax paper and
chill for 1/2 hour.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a well-floured
surface or pastry cloth, roll the dough out to about 1/8 inch thick.
With a sharp knife, cut the dough into graham cracker shapes, 2-inch
by 3-inch rectangles. Transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet.
Prick each one in 3 places with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 20 minutes. Turn the crackers and continue baking for
another 5 to 10 minutes, or until they are just golden brown. Remove
any crackers that brown before the others. Be careful not to overbake
these crackers. Cool them on a rack. Yield: 60-70.
