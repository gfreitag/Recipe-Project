Title: Tofu Provencal
Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 lb Firm tofu; patted dry
-- and cut into 1/2" cubes
3    Garlic cloves; minced
2 md Onions; chopped
35 oz Canned plum tomatoes w/juice
-- (chopped)
1 tb Tomato paste
2 c  Diced green beans
1/2 ts Dried basil
1/2 ts Dried oregano
1    Bay leaf
Pepper; to taste
Heat a bit of oil in large skillet.  Stir fry tofu until golden.
Remove from pan and drain.

Saute garlic and onions for about 5 mins.  Add tomatoes, their juice
and tomato paste, stir until blended.

Return tofu to pan, add remaining ingredients and toss thoroughly.
Cover and simmer 15 mins or until green beans are tender.  If sauce
is too thin boil uncovered to reduce.

We LOVE this quick simple dish; sometimes I will substitute Zukes, or
squash, or mushrooms for all or part of the tofu.   Enjoy.

A quick easy companion dish:

One box of NEAR EAST Bulghur Pilaf and some fresh mushrooms.

Slice mushrooms and add to sauce pan.  Pour on water needed for Pilaf
and bring to a boil add NE mix and simmer 15 minutes.  It is GREAT!
