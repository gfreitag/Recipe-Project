Title: Saltimbocca Alla Romana
Categories: Italian, Meat
Yield: 6 servings
2 lb Veal scaloppine, each
Piece 5 inches square
1 ts Dried sage
1/4 lb Thin slices prosciutto
3 tb Butter
Salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
1/2 c  Dry white wine
Sprinkle veal slices with sage.  Cover each slice with a slice
of prosciutto and trim this to the same size as the veal, reserving
the trimmings for sauces.  Pin the prosciutto slices to the veal
slices with toothpicks.  Heat the butter in a large frying pan.  Add
the meat in one layer and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn with a
pancake turner and cook until golden on both sides.  Season to taste.
Place the slices of meat, ham side up, on a heated serving platter
and remove the toothpicks. Keep the meat warm.  Add the wine to the
pan and scrape the browned bits from the bottom; bring quickly to the
boiling point.  Pour the sauce over the meat and serve immediately.
