*BEURRE MANIE: Process 8 Tbs of softened unsalted butter and 8 Tbs
all-purpose flour in a food processor until smooth. Divide the
mixture into 8 equal parts and, with floured hands, shape each into a
ball. Place the Beurre Manie in a tightly covered jar and refrigerate
for up to 1 week. Beurre Manie can also be frozen for 2 to 3 months.

1. Melt the butter in a heavy skillet over medium-low heat and whisk
constantly until a light hazelnut brown. Immediately add the cream and
simmer until reduced by one quarter. Whisk in bits of the beurre
manie and simmer until the sauce lightly coats a spoon. Add the
Gorgonzola and Parmesan, season with salt and white pepper, and
simmer until the cheeses have melted.

2. Add the gnocchi to the skillet and simmer gently until just heated
through. Serve at once with a grating of Parmesan.
