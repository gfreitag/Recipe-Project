Influenced by the Muslims from India, as evidenced by the use of
fragrant spices.

Break the chilies and shake out the seeds.  Soak the chilies in
boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes.

Heat the oil and fry the onions and garlic, over low heat, until they
are soft and starting to turn brown.  Add the shrimp paste and fry
for a minute longer, crushing it in the oil with the back of a spoon.
Remover from the heat and when cool, put it into the container of an
electric blender with the soaked and drained chillies, lemon grass
and galangal.  Blend to a smooth paste, adding a little water, if
necessary, to facilitate blending.

In a dry pan, toast the coriander seeds until brown, shaking the pan
or stirring frequently.  Turn out and allow to cool while toasting
the cummin and fennel seeds slightly.  Pound all the seeds, in a
mortar and pestle, to a fine powder.  If using ground coriander,
cummin and fennel, they may be combined and dry-roasted in a small
pan, using low heat and stirring constantly to ensure they do not
burn.  Roast until they are a rich brown colour and have a fine
aromatic smell.  Combine with the pureed ingredients and add the
ground cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg and cloves.  Bottle and store in
the refrigerator. Submitted By ROBERT MILES   On   08-17-95
