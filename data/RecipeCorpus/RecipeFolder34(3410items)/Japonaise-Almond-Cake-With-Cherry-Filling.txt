CAKE BASE: Preheat oven to 250 C. Grate the chocolate. Mix the flour,
grated chocolate, coconut and ground almonds in a small bowl. Whip
the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar and a
pinch of salt, and whip until stiff. Fold the dry ingredients into
the whipped whites. Draw two circles of 26 cm each on parchment
paper. Divide the mixture between both circles, and flatten with a
spatula. Bake for only 3 minutes. Cool and peel the cake base circles
from the parchment paper.

CHERRY FILLING: Heat the milk until lukewarm, and dissolve the
gelatine in it. Drain the can of cherries. Set a few cherries aside.
Using a mixer, whip the egg yolks with the sugar, lemon rind and
vanilla sugar. Add the dissolved gelatine. In a separate bowl, whip
the heavy cream. Fold the yolks into the whipped cream, then the
cherries and the liquer.

ASSEMBLY: Put one cake base in a 26 cm springform. Sprinkle lightly
with cherry liquer. Spread half the cherry filling. Put the second
cake base on the filling, sprinkle with liquer, and spread the
remaining filling on it. Refrigerate for several hours or overnight.

PRESENTATION: Melt some chocolate in a double broiler. Coat the saved
cherries with melted chocolate. Cool. Free the cake from the
springform. Ice with whipped cream. Cover the sides with chopped
pecans. Garnish with whipped cream flowers and the chocolate covered
cherries.
