Categories: Country coo, Breads
Yield: 4 servings
-flour
2 tb Olive oil
1 ts Salt
Egg Wash (recipe follows)
6    Slices bacon, chopped
3/4 c  Warm water (110'F to 115'F)
1 tb Sugar
1 pk Active dry yeast
2 1/2    To 3 C unsifted all-purpose
1. In skillet, fry bacon until crisp. Remove from beat; set aside to
cool slightly.

2. In large bowl, combine water and sugar; add yeast and stir to
dissolve. Let mixture stand until foamy-about 5 minutes.

3. Add 1 1/2 C flour, the oil, salt, reserved bacon and drippings to
yeast mixture. Beat vigorously with wooden spoon 2 to 3 minutes to
blend and develop dough. Stir in 1 C additional flour until combined.
Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead dough 2 minutes,
adding remaining flour, if necessary until dough is smooth and
elastic-about 10 minutes.

4. Wash, dry, and lightly oil mixing bowl. Place dough in oiled bowl,
turning to bring oiled side up. Cover with clean cloth; let dough
rise in warm place until double in size-about 1 flour.

5. Grease 2 baking sheets. Divide dough into quarters; roll one
quarter into 8 by 6-inch rectangle, making edges slightly thicker
than center. With sharp knife, starting 1 1/4 inches from edge, cut
three rows of lengthwise diagonal slits, about 1 inch long and 1 inch
apart. Transfer dough to prepared baking sheets; with fingers, widen
slits to create holes in dough. Repeat with remaining dough quarters.

6. Cover dough quarters with clean cloth and let rise in warm place 30
niinutes.

7. Heat oven to 400'F. Brush dough quarters with Egg Wash (recipe foi-
lows), widening holes if necessary. Bake 15 minutes or until lightly
browned and barely crisp. Cool breads to room temperature on wire
rack; serve, or store in airtight container, Egg Wash: In small bowl,
combine 1 large egg and 2 T water; beat until well blended.
