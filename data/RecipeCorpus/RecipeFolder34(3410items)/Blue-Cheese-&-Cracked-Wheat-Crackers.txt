Title: Blue Cheese & Cracked Wheat Crackers
Categories: Breads, Low cal/fat
Yield: 5 dozen
1/2 c  Low-fat buttermilk
1/4 c  (1 oz.) Crumbled blue cheese
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 tb All-purpose flour; divided
x  Vegetable cooking spray
1 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 c  Uncooked bulgur (cracked
-wheat)
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Baking soda
Combine the first 4 ingredients in a medium bowl; stir well.  Stir in
buttermilk, cheese, and oil to form a soft dough (dough will be
sticky). Divide dough into 4 equal portions, shaping each portion
into a ball. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon flour over balls; cover and let
rest 5 minutes.

Roll 1 ball into a 10 x 6-inch paper thin rectangle on a baking sheet
coated with cooking spray, dusting dough with 3/4 teaspoon flour to
keep from sticking to rolling pin.  Score dough by making 4
lengthwise cuts and 2 crosswise cuts to form 15 crackers.  Prick each
cracker diagonally 4 times with a fork.

Bake at 375 degrees F. for 11 minutes or until crisp.  Remove from
pan, and let cool completely on a wire rack.  Separate into
individual crackers. Repeat procedure with remaining dough and flour.
Store in an airtight container.  Yield:  5 dozen (serving size:  1
cracker).
