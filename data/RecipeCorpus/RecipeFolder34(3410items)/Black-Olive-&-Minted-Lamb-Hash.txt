"What follows is originally a Basque dish that obviously went through
several changes by the time I came upon it in Kern County, California,
where ripe black olives grow in profusion."

Cook potatoes in boiling water until just tender, about 20 minutes.
Rinse under cold running water; drain. Peel the potatoes and cut into
1/2 inch cubes. Set aside. Heat the butter with the oil in a large
heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion; cook 1 minute. Add
the garlic; cook until golden, about 4 minutes longer. Push the onion
to the edges and add the lamb to the centre of the skillet. Cook,
tossing gently, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add the
potatoes to the skillet and mix well. Stir in the olives, peppers,
mint and soy sauce. Cook over medium heat, stirring occiasionally ,
until the potatoes begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle the
mixture with the beef broth. Add salt and pepper to taste. Lightly
press the hash down and cook, without stirring, 10 minutes. Preheat
the broiler. Sprinkle the cheese over the hash mixture and place
under the broiler until the top is crisp. SERVES: 4-6
