Categories: Country coo, Vegetables, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
4    Plum tomatoes, seeded and
-chopped
1/3 c  Dried currants
1 tb Drained capers
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
3 tb Chopped fresh parsley leaves
1/2 ts Red-wine vinegar
2 md Eggplants (1 1/2 lb)
1 1/4 ts Salt
2 tb Pine nuts
3 tb Olive oil
1 c  Finely chopped onion
3    Cloves garlic, finely
-chopped
1. Cut eggplants lengthwise in half. With sharp knife make 6
lengthwise slits into flesh of each half, cutting deeply but not
piercing skin. Reserve 1/4 t salt. To extract bitterness, sprinkle
remaining salt over cut sides of eggplant halves, allowing salt to
fall into slits. Place eggplant halves, flesh side down, in colander.
Set aside at least 30 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, in large skillet, heat pine nuts until golden brown; set
aside. In same skillet, heat 2 T oil over medium heat. Add onion and
garlic; saute until onion is golden. Stir tomatoes, currants, capers,
pepper, and reserved 1/4 t salt into onion mixture. Cover and cook,
stirring frequently, until tomatoes soften-10 to 12 minutes. Add 2 T
parsley, the remaining 1 T oil, the reserved pine nuts, and the
vinegar to mixture; stir to blend.

3. Heat oven to 350'F. lightly oil baking sheet. Pat eggplant flesh
dry. (If necessary, trim a thin slice from skinside of halves so they
will stand up and not lean when stuffed with vegetable mixture.) Top
each eggplant half with one quarter of vegetable mixture. With spoon,
force some of mixture into lengthwise slits. Place stuffed halves on
prepared sheet; cover loosely with aluminum foil and bake 30 minutes.
Uncover and bake 10 minutes longer.

4. Sprinkle eggplant halves with remaining parsley.
