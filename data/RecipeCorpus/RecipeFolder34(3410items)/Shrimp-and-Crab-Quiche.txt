1) Preheat the oven to 400.F

2) To prepare the crust: on a lightly floured work surface roll out
the puff pastry large enough to fit a 9-in pie plate or quiche pan
with a 1-inch over-hang. Cut to fit and press gently into edges and
up sides of pan and crimp. Brush the bottom of pastry shell with the
mustard. Lightly cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready
to use.

3) To make the filling: In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the
butter and add the onion and leeks. Cover and cook 15 min. or until
tender, stirring occasionally. Gently stir in the crab meat, fish,
and shrimp just to coat. Reserve until ready to use.

4) In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, 1/2 & 1/2, cheese,
thyme, chives, nutmeg, parsley, salt, and pepper until well blended.

5) Ladle the seafood mixture into the patry shell and pour the egg
mixture on top.

6) Bake the quiche for 10 min. Then reduce temp to 350 F and bake for
35-40 min. more or until filling is set and the crust is light golden
brown. ( Note: the quiche filling will become firmer as it cools.)
Serve quiche at room temp.
