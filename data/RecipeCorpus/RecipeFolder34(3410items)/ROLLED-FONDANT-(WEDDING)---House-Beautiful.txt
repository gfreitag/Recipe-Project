Title: ROLLED FONDANT (WEDDING) - House Beautiful
Categories: House beaut, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 fondant
1/2 c  Cold water
2 tb Gelatin
Yellow food coloring
Red food coloring
4 lb Confectioners' sugar,
-plus extra for kneading
1 1/4 c  Light corn syrup
2 ts Orange extract
2 ts Vanilla extract
*The fondant can be made up to a week ahead, but must be applied to
the cake at least two days before the wedding.

In a large mixing bowl, sift the confecfioners' sugar. Make a well in
the center of the sugar, and add the corn syrup and extracts; do not
mix.

In a small saucepan add the water and sprinkle the gelatin over it.
Let stand 1 minute. Heat the gelatin and water over medium heat for
1/2 minute or until it is hot and the gelatin is fully dissolved.
Pour mixture into well. Quickly stir mixture with a heavy wooden
spoon from the center out to evenly disperse the gelatin.

When the mixture becomes too thick to stir, turn it out onto a work
surface dusted with confectioners' sugar. Knead the fondant until
smooth and doughlike. If the fondant is sticky (this tends to happen
in humid weather), knead in more confectioners' sugar.

Knead in food coloring until desired color is achieved. Add coloring
a few drops at a time, as a little goes a long way. Store fondant in
a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator up to one week. Bring
to room temperature, then knead well prior to use. If fondant is too
dry, add a few drops of water. If fondant is too sticky, add more
confectioners' sugar. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in an
airtight container for several hours before using.
