Categories: House beaut, Fruit, Pie/tart, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Sugar
3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
2 tb All-purpose flour
1 ts Unsalted butter
2 ts Confectioner's sugar
1    Recipe Flaky Butter Pastry
Flour for rolling
1 1/2 lb Apples, such as Macintosh
-or Winesap
2 tb Fresh lemonjuice
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a rough circle
about 14 to 15 inches in diameter. Transfer the dough to a baking
sheet and refrigerate while you prepare the apples.

Peel and core the apples. Slice them into 1/4-inch-thick slices. You
should have about 3 C of fruit. Place the apples in a bowl and toss
them with the lemon juice, 3 T of the sugar, and the cinnamon. In a
small bowl, combine the 2 T of flour with the remaining sugar. Remove
dough from the refrigerator and sprinkle the sugar-flour mixture over
the dough, leaving a 2-inch border uncovered. Arrange the apple
slices evenly over the flour-sugar mixture. Fold the 2-inch border of
dough over the apples in overlapping folds to form the sides of the
tart. Brush the folds of dough lightly with water and crimp with your
fingers to seal, Shave the butter on top of the apples.

Bake the tart in a preheated 400'F oven for 40 minutes, covering the
crust after 20 minutes with foil if it is browning too rapidly. The
tart should be golden brown and the apples tender with syrupy juice.
Let cool 10 minutes before sliding the tart onto a serving platter.
Just before serving, sift the confectioner's sugar evenly over the
crust. Makes one 9-to 10-inch tart. Serves 6 to 8.
