Shalom,

My name is Gabi Shahar, and I live in Israel.

During 1993 and 1994 I discovered the world of electronic recipes,
and also contributed some.  Most of all, I liked the Internet mailing
lists EAT-L (recipe exchange), FOODWINE (chat and fun), J-FOOD-L
(Japanese food), and CHILE-HEADS (chiles and hot stuff); the Fidonet
echoes COOKING, HOME COOKING, INTERNATIONAL COOKING, and GOURMET; the
Usenet newsgroups rec.food.recipes, rec.food.sourdough and
rec.food.veg.cooking; and the highly stuffed and staffed COOKS forum
in CompuServe.

All of this is behind me, discontinued from January 1995.

I learned a lot, really became an expert, during this period.  I made
a lot of friends, who helped me, visited me, and even sent me
interesting food samples.  I'll miss you all, and will come back in a
few years.

This file contains some of the recipes I typed over these years, and
I hope you enjoy them.

If you want to ask questions or just keep in touch, please send me
regular mail to the following address:

Gabi Shahar Amnon Vetamar 12 Hertzliya 46417 Israel

Thanks and bye,
Gabi.
