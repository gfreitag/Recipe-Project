1 c  Yogurt *
1 tb Garlic -- minced
1/2 ts Ground Cumin
1/2 ts Curry Powder
1/4 ts Cayenne

2    Boneless Chicken Breasts --
* Preferbly goat's milk yogurt, but you can use whole-milk or low-fat
plain yogurt.

1. In a nonreactive bowl, combine the yogurt with all the remaining
ingredients except the chicken. Stir to blend well, add the chicken
breasts, and marinate, covered and refrigerated, at least 3 hrs, or
overnight for richer flavor.

2. For the sauce, heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over
moderate heat. Saute the garlic, onion, and cucumbers until softened,
about 5 mins. Stir in the curry, cumin, and cayenne. Add the tomatoes
and simmer until juicy, about 10 mins.

3. Preheat a broiler grill, grill pan, or outdoor grill.

4. Remove the chicken from the marinade and set aside. Add 1/2 cup of
the marinade to the tomato sauce. Bring to a boil, lower the heat,
and simmer 1 min.

5. Puree the sauce in a blender or food processor. Strain through a
sieve into a nonreactive saucepan and season with 1/2 tsp salt. Keep
the sauce warm.

6. Cook the chicken breasts over a hot grill until cooked through but
still juicy, about 5 mins for each side. Alternatively, cook the
chicken breasts under a preheated broiler, 4 to 5 mins per side.

7. Transfer the chicken breasts to a platter and serve with the warm
sauce.
