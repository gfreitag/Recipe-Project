Unlike most other fruits, a melon can't be judged just by its
appearance. Here are four tips to help you choose a ripe melon:

* PRESS IT - the flesh at the stem end should yield only slightly.

* SMELL IT - the fragrance at the stem end should be pleasant without
being too strong.

* HOLD IT  - the heavier the melon, the juicier the flesh.

* SHAKE IT - nothing should rattle; if you sense seeds or juices
moving, the melon is overripe.

It's easier to judge the ripeness of a cut melon. Look for:

* Flesh that smells fragrant.

* Flesh that is moist.

* Flesh that has a rich uniform color. Streaks of green near the rind
mean that the melon isn't ripe enough; watery or translucent streaks
indicate that it is overripe.

* Seeds that are intact. If the seeds have fallen off and clump
together, the melon is probably too ripe.
