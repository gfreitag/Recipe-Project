-beans (cannellini), drained
1/4 c  Water
1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves
1/4 ts Ground white pepper
1. In small bowl, cover dried tomatoes with boiling water; set aside
30 minutes to soften. Place 1 T oil in a cup and remaining oil in food
processor fitted with chopping blade.

2. Meanwhile, prepare Tart Shells: Heat oven to 375'F. In medium-size
bowl, combine flour, salt, and coriander. With hands, rub chick-pea
puree into flour until mixture resembles fine crumbs. In small
saucepan, heat shortening and water until melted; slowly pour into
flour mixture, stiffing lightly with fork just until mixture clings
together. Gather mixture and form into a ball.

3. Divide ball into 6 pieces; shape each into a disk. On lightly
floured surface, roll each disk to a 5 1/2-inch round. Fit into
4-inch tart pans with removable bottoms. With fork, pierce bottoms
and sides of tarts several times. Place tarts on baking sheet for
easier handling. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.

4. Meanwhile, drain tomatoes and dis- card liquid. Toss 6 tomato
halves with 1 reserved T oil in cup and set aside. In food processor,
process remaining tomatoes with the 3 T oil until pureed. Transfer
puree to a bowl and set aside. Wash and dry food processor; set aside
for use in step 6 below.

5. Prepare White-Bean Filling: In medium-size skillet, heat olive oil
over medium heat. Add onion and saute until translucent. Add beans,
water, thyme, and pepper. Heat to boiling; cover and reduce heat to
low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid evaporates-about 10
minutes. Meanwhile, remove tarts, still on baking sheet, to wire
rack. Reduce oven temperature to 350-F.

6. In food processor fitted with chopping blade, puree bean mixture
until smooth.

7. To fill tarts, spoon about 2 t tomato puree evenly onto bottom of
each tart shell. Divide bean filling among tarts; spread evenly to
cover puree. Sprinkle 1 T oil-cured olives around edge of each tart
over filling, sprinkle 1 tablespoon Sicilian olives to till center of
each tart.

8. Bake tarts 7 to 10 minutes longer or until warm. Place one reserved
dried tomato in center of each tart. Top with fresh thyme sprigs, if
desired. Remove tarts from pans and serve immediately.
