Preheat the oven to 350.  Lightly grease an 11 x 7 baking pan with
butter or oil.  For the cake, sift the flour, baking soda, baking
powder, salt and cinnamon together into a small bowl.  Place the oats
in a medium size bowl. Cream the butter, sugar, and vanilla together
in a second medium size mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium
speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.  Stop the mixer twice
to scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula.  Add the eggs one at a time
to the butter mixture and mix on medium speed after each addition
until blended, 10 seconds.  Scrape the bowl each time.  Pour the
boiling water over the oatmeal and stir several times with a wooden
spoon.  Add the oatmeal  to the egg mixture and mix on medium speed
until blended, about 6 to 7 seconds.  Partially fold in the dry
ingredients by hand with the spatula, using several broad strokes.
Then mix on medium speed until all the ingredients are blended, about
10 seconds.  Scrape the bowl.   Pour the batter into the prepared
pan.  Bake the cake on the center oven rack until the top is golden
and springs back to the touch, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove the cake
from the oven and allow it to cool for 15 minutes. Meanwhile prepare
the topping.  Put all the ingredients in a medium-size mixing bowl
and stir vigorously with a whisk until they are blended.  Preheat the
broiler.  Spread the topping over the cake with a spatula, then place
the cake on a cookie sheet.  Place the cake on the center rack.  With
the oven or broiler door open, broil, rotating the pan several times,
until the topping bubbles to a deep golden color, 5 to 6 minutes.
