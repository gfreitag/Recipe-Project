2 md Red onions
1 tb Finely chopped fresh chives
1/3 c  Reduced-fat mayonnaise

1/3 c  Sour cream
1/4 c  Water
MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
1    Large egg, hard-cooked
-and finely chopped
1    Small yellow tomato,
-chopped (opt.)
8    Slices toasted French bread
1 pk (1-lb) thick-sliced bacon
6 c  Torn mixed greens (we used
-endive, watercress, and
-green-leaf lettuce)
1 1/2 lb Cherry tomatoes,
-preferably on stems
1. Prepare Dressing: In small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, sour
cream, water, vinegar, and salt; set aside. Cut red onions crosswise
in half. To make onion cups, cut and scoop out each onion half,
leaving bottom intact and about a 1/4-inch- thick shell. Finely chop
enough scooped-out onion to make 1/4 C. (Wrap and refrigerate
leftover onion for another use.) Add chopped onion to mayonnaise
mixture. Fill red-onion cup with dressing, garnish with chives, if
desired, and refrigerate while preparing Salad.

2. Prepare Salad: Heat large skillet over medium-high heat. Roll up
each slice of bacon, starting at either short end. Stand each bacon
roll on either end in hot skillet. Cook 3 to 4 minutes to brown;
drain fat from skillet, holding rolls in place with a saucepan lid.

3. With metal tongs, carefully turn over each bacon roll to stand on
other end; cook 5 minutes or until browned. Transfer bacon rolls to
paper towel to drain.

4. To arrange salad, place 1 1/2 C greens on each serving plate;
cluster some of cherry tomatoes beside greens. Top greens with bacon,
chopped egg, and, if desired, chopped yellow tomato. Place filled
red-onion cups and 2 slices toasted bread on each plate. Serve
immediately.
