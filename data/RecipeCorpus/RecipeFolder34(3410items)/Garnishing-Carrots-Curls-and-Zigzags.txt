1.  It is easiest to make the carrot curl when the vegetable is
allowed to reach room temperature.  To make the carrot curls, select
a fat, uniformly tapered carrot and wash in cold water.  Cut about
1/2 inch off the tip, or root end, of the vegetable.

2. Use a vegetable peeling knife (the swivel peelers work best.) and
peel a strip the full length of the carrot.  Creat a flat side on the
carrot to prevent it from rolling around whn making the strips needed
for the carrot curls.  Hold the carrot steady in one hand, place the
peeler flat against the top rounded side of the carrot and with an
even pressure and quick stroke, run the peeler down the full length
of the carrot, pushing the peeler away from you.

3. Continue with the peeler. Roll up the wide strips with your
fingers and secure the curled strips by placing a toothpick through
the rolled strip. Drop these rolled carrot curls into ice water and
refrigerate for several hours to set the curl. Remove the toothpick
prior to serving.
