Recipe by: Elizabeth Powell Preparation Time: 1:15 Shred spinach and
mix with scallions, parsley, dill, and salt.  Let stand 10 minutes.
Squeeze out moisture by the handful.  Heat olive oil in a large
skillet and saute onions until transparent, about 5 minutes.  Stir in
spinach and cheeses. Remove from heat and cool, stirring
occasionally, to room temperature. Beat eggs in with a wooden spoon.
Brush bottom and sides of a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking dish with melted
butter. Line the dish with a sheet of filo, pressing the edges of
pastry firmly into the corners, and against the sides of the dish.
Brush surface of filo with melted butter, spreading it all the way to
the outside edges and lay another sheet of filo on top. Repeat until
you have used 7 layers of filo in all.

Spread spinach mixture evenly over last layer of filo and smooth it
into the corners. Place another sheet of filo on top, coat with
butter and repeat with remaining layers of butter and filo as before.
Turn edges over to form a crust. Brush the top with the remaining
butter. Bake at 300 degrees for 1 hour or until the pastry is crisp
and delicately browned. Cut into squares and serve hot.
