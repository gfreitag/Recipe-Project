Categories: Appetizers, Herbs/spice, Companion
Yield: 1 wheel
1 c  Chopped watercress

"Although brie is not a fresh cheese, it, too, has a wonderful
affinity for any number of herbs.  A large wheel topped with a
variety of herbs and served with bread or crackers is a buffet in
itself.

DIRECTIONS: =========== Cut off the top rind of the brie. Lightly
mark the top of the cheese into four pie-shaped wedges with a knife,
then divide each wedge into three more wedges, again marking lightly.
Sprinkle half the walnuts onto one of the wedge-shaped areas and
press them gently into the surface.  Repeat the process with half of
each of the remaining ingredients, proceeding in order around the
wheel. Allow the brie to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes
before serving. The wheel can be loosely wrapped and refrigerated for
as long as four hours.
