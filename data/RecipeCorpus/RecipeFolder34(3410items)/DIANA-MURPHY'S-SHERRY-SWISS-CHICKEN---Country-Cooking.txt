1  With a very sharp knife, horizontally slice each chicken breast
into 2 very thin cutlets, then lightly pound each cutlet.

2. In large skillet, heat 1 T oil over medium-high heat. Lightly coat
the chicken with flour, shake off excess, and reserve 2 T  flour.
Place as many cutlets in the pan as will fit and sprinkle with
freshly ground pepper and paprika.

3. Cook chicken on each side until lightly browned-about 3 minutes per
side. Repeat with remaining cutlets, using more oil as needed. Remove
cooked chicken and place in a single layer in large baking dish. Pour
dry sherry into skillet, increase heat to high, and stir to loosen
browned-on bits. Allow sherry to reduce for 2 minutes.

4. Heat oven to 350F. Add chicken broth and thyme to skillet, and
allow to reduce for 3 to 4 minutes. Mix the 2 reserved T of flour
with water until smooth. Stirring constantly, drizzle the flour-water
mixture into the skillet until sauce is slightly thickened. Pour
sauce over cooked chicken in baking dish. Place cheese slices over
chicken and bake 25 to 30 minutes or until cheese is bubbling. Serve
immediately.
