In a large pan, saute onions and garlic in oil until tender. Remove
and set aside. Add chuck to pan, brown on all sides, then remove to
onion dish. Add sausage and brown, Return all to pan. Add ribs,
mainara sauce, water or wine, tomato paste and spices and bring to a
boil. Reduce heat, cover partially, simmer 3 hrs. or until chuck is
very tender, degreasing occasionally. Just before serving, stir in
basil. Divide pasta among 6 bowls and top with meat mixture then
cheese.

This is absolutely excellent. I made my spaghetti sauce in place of
marinara sauce. Next time, change the ribs and beef and substitute
round steak.  The wine makes it! Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.00
