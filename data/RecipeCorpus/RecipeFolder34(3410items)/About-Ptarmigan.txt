Title: About Ptarmigan
Categories: Information, Game, Poultry
Yield: 1 text file  Ptarmigan is a white feathered northern cousin to the partridge and
grouse. It is quite a bit smaller than them. They may be cooked as
for grouse, quail or Cornish Game Hen.

Locally the usual method of dressing them is to skin them not pluck
them and to reserve the breasts, drumsticks and giblets only. I
accumulate hearts, livers and gizzards separately in 3 bags in the
deep freeze until I have enough to make a meal of them. Most of the
recipes in my collection are for boneless breasts. The drumsticks are
usually marinaded in a Teriyaki sauce and then panfried or treated as
for chicken Hot Wings.

Alternatively the entire carcass with the breast removed together
with the heart and gizzard but not the liver can go to the stock pot.
