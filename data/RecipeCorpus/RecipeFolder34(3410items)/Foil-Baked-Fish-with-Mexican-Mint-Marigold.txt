Categories: Fish/seafoo, Herbs/spice, Main dish
Yield: 1 batch
Salt and pepper; to taste
1 c  Chopped Mexican mint
-- marigold leaves
1 lb Fresh fish fillets
Thin lemon slices
Butter; to taste
Put fish fillets on a piece of buttered aluminum foil or parchment.
Slash the fillets at 2" intervals and insert a thin slice of lemon
into each cut. Dot the fish with butter, salt and pepper, then
sprinkle with Mexican mint marigold leaves.  Double-fold the edges of
the foil to seal; fold parchment around the fish, letter style, then
turn the ends under.

Bake the packet no more than 20 minutes in a preheated 350 F. oven.
The fish is done when it flakes easily.  Avoid overcooking.
