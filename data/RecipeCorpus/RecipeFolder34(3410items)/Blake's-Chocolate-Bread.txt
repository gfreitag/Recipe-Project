Categories: Breads, Chocolate
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Margarine, Reduced-Calorie
3 tb Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
1 ts Chocolate-Flavored Extract
1/2 ts Almond-Flavored Extract
1/2 ts Imitation Butter Flavoring
3 c  Bread Flour
1 c  Skim Milk -- warmed
1    1/4 Oz Pack Dry Yeast
1/2 c  Sugar
1/4 ts Salt
2 oz Unsweetened Chocolate --

In a medium bowl, combine the milk, yeast, sugar and salt; stir well
and let stand for 5 mins. Add the remaining ingredients except the
flour, stirring well. Gradually stir in the flour, mixing well. With
floured hands, place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead
until it is smooth and slightly sticky to the touch. Place the dough
in a large bowl that has been sprayed with nonstick vegetable cooking
spray. Sray the top of the dough eith the cooking spray and cover
with a clean, dry towel; let stand in a warm place until doubled in
size. Remove the towel and, with your fist, punch the dough down,
then place it on a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into 4
equal pieces. Shape each piece into a loaf by pressing down and
rolling with the palm of your hand and your fingertips, tucking in
the sides while rolling. Spray four 2 x 6 x 3-inch loaf pans with
nonstick vegetable cooking spray. Put the dough in pans and cover
with a dry towel; allow the dough to rise until it doubles in size
again. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 F. Remove the towel and
bake the bread for 35 mins. Let the bread cool for 15 mins before
serving. Makes four 1/2 lb. loaves.
