(Cane River Cuisine is the name of the book.  It's a compilation of
recipes of different women from the town of Natchitoches, Louisiana.
I'm not sure if there are any more copies to be found, but I'll check
it out for you.)

Try this recipe with both chicken and squirrel: BTW, this recipe
works well with rabbit.
