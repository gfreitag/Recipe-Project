Title: PORCINI, POTATO AND BARLEY SOUP - House Beautiful
Categories: House beaut, Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
2 oz Coarsely chopped prosciutto
1/2 c  Barley
7 c  To 8 C beef broth, may be
-half canned, half water
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
Coarse salt as needed
Finely chopped fresh
-parsley, oregano, marjoram
-or mint for garnish
1/2 oz Dried porcini mushrooms
1 c  Hot water
3 tb Olive oil
2 c  Finely chopped onions
1 1/2 c  Finely chopped carrots
1 c  Finely chopped celery ribs
1    Medium-large potato, cut
-into 1/2-inch cubes,
-about 1 1/2 C
In a small bowl, soak mushrooms in water for at least 20 minutes, or
until ready to use.

In a 4- to 6-quart heavy-bottomed stockpot, heat oil over medium heat
and saute the onion, stirring occasionally until limp but not brown,
8 to 10 minutes. Add carrots and celery and saute, stirring
occasionally until the vegetables begin to brown, about 8 to 10
minutes.

Drain mushrooms, reserving liquid, and coarsely chop. Stir mushrooms
into the pot and saute 2 to 3 minutes.

Add potatoes, prosciutto, barley, 7 C broth and pepper. Pass the
reserved mushroom liquid through a coffee filter or fine strainer
lined with cheesecloth and add to the mixture. Raise the heat to
high, cover stockpot, and bring to a boil. Adjust heat to simmer,
partially cover and cook for 1 hour or until barley is very tender
and the soup is thick. Correct seasoning if necessary.

Allow soup to rest for a few hours or up to a few days before
serving. Soup will thicken as it stands.

Before serving, bring the soup back to a simmer. If it is too thick,
thin it with remaining broth or water.

Serve very hot in deep or flat bowls, sprinkled with a chopped herb if
desired-mint is surprisingly appropriate. Serves 6.
