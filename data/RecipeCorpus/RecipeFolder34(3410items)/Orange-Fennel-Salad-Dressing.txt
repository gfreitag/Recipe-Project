Title: Orange-Fennel Salad Dressing
Categories: Condiments
Yield: 1 1/4 cups
1 ts Arrowroot
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Lemon juice
2 ts Dijon mustard
Salt and pepper to taste
2 ts Basil, minced
1 ts Fennel seeds
2 1/2 c  Orange juice
1 lg Fennel bulb
-with feathery tops
-halved, cored
-slice lengthwise
8    Crushed saffron threads
1. In a nonreactive medium saucepan, toast the fennel seeds over
moderately high heat, shaking the pan, until fragrant, about 2
minutes. Add the orange juice, slice fennel and saffron and bring to
a boil. Lower the heat to moderate and simmer until the juice has
reduced to 1 cup, about 20 minutes. Strain the juice into a bowl,
pressing down on the cooked fennel; reserve the fennel.

2. Return the juice to the saucepan and bring to a simmer over
moderate heat. In a small bowl, mix the arrowroot with 2 tbs of
water, then whisk into the juice and cook just until thickened, about
30 seconds. Remove from heat, stir in the cooked fennel and let stand
at room temperature until cool. Strain the mixture into a medium bowl
and whisk in the olive oil, lemon juice and mustard. Season the
dressing with salt and freshly ground white pepper. (Can be
refrigerated, covered, for up to 3 days.) Stir in the basil just
before serving.
