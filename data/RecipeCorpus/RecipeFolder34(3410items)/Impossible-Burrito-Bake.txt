1 c  Bisquick
Salt & pepper to taste
1/3 c  Water
Mix Bisquick, water and refried beans together and put it in the
bottom of a greased pie plate. Brown and drain seasoned ground beef;
put on top of mixture in pie plate. Add salsa and then cheese. Bake,
uncovered, for 30 minutes at 350 or till golden brown. We have found
if you let it sit for about 15 min, it tends to cut more like a pie.
Serve with extra salsa, sour cream and mexican chips. Can be made the
night before and refrigerated; then put in the oven. (wrv)
