Title: Hokien Style Ginger Roast Chicken
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb White pepper -- cracked
1 tb Star anise -- ground
1 tb Red pepper flakes
2 tb Kosher salt
2 lb To 3 lb whole chicken
4 tb Ginger root -- minced
2 tb Sesame oil
1 tb Oil
4 tb Scallions -- minced
Preheat the oven to 425.  Lift the skin away from the meat at the
breastbone of one bird, right at the top of the cavity into which you
would put stuffing if you were doing that.  With a sharp knife, cut
the membrane that holds the skin to the flesh along the center of the
bird, then slide your fingers under the skin and probe around on top
of the breast down to the ribs, separating the skin from the meat.
Repeat this process with the second bird.  In a small bowl, combine
the ginger, oils and scallions and mix well.  Spread half of this
mixture evenly underneath the skin of each bird, trying not to poke
through the skin in the process. In a small bowl, combine the white
pepper, anise, red pepper flakes and salt and mix well. Rub this
mixture all over the outside of the chickens. Place the birds on a
rack in a roasting pan and roast in the oven for 40 to 50 minutes,
until done.
