Title: Lentil Roll-ups
Categories: Vegetables, Appetizers, Vegetarian, Pastry
Yield: 33 servings
1/4 ts Thyme; dry, crumbled
1/8 ts Black pepper
1 cl Garlic; minced
1 lb Pkg phyllo pastry
2 tb Canola oil
1 c  Cooked Laird lentils
2 tb Parmesan cheese; grated *
-[optional]
1 tb Onion; finely chopped
1/4 ts Oregano; dry, crumbled
* For vegans, the cheese could be omitted without too much lose of
flavor or 4 tbsp cheddar-flavored tofu substituted. [I have not seen
Parmesan flavored tofu in the marketplace... yet.]

Puree the cooked lentils. Add cheese, onion, and spices. Mix well.
Preheat oven to 325 F. Cut individual phyllo pastry sheets into 6"x8"
pieces and brush with oil. Spread 1 tsp filling along one end of
pastry sheet and roll over once. Turn in pastry edges and roll up
like a cigar. Repeat. Place filled pastries on a non-stick baking
sheet and bake at 325 for 15-20 min until golden brown.
