The Amount of Shellfish to Purchase

In determining the amount of shellfish to purchase use the same scale
as for fresh fish, which is approximately 1/3 pound of edible fish
per person. Specifically this translates as the following:

1/2 pound or 6 large shrimp Shrimp--raw,
1/3 pound Scallops--fresh 1/3 pound
1 large crab or 2 small Oysters &
Shrimp--raw (in shell)
shelled
Crabs--soft-shelled, live
clams-(in shell) 6 oysters or clams Oysters & clams--shucked 6
oysters or clams Lobster--fresh 1 pound or 1 small or 1/2 large
Lobster--tails 1 large tail or 8 ounces Lobster meat 1/3 pound
Mussels 12 mussels Prawns 6 large prawns

All amounts on the chart are the amounts per person. They are average
servings as an entree.  If your family or friends are hearty fish
eaters the figures should be adjusted. Should the fish be used as an
appetizer or served with a rich sauce, less is required.
