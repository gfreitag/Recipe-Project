Title: SZECHUAN CAMPHOR-WOOD AND TEA SMOKED DUCK
Categories: Chinese, Poultry
Yield: 6 servings
3 tb Sugar
1    Bundle camphor wood; or
4    To 5 tb camphor wood sawdust
Some smoldering charcoal
A wire rack
Inverted clean kerosene tin
-- or inverted metal du
4    Slices root ginger
1/2 tb Peppercorns
4    To 5 lb duck
1 tb Sea salt
2 tb Lard
Smoking:
4    To 5 tb dried tea
Shred & chop the ginger. Roast the peppercorns in a dry roasting pan
for 10 minutes in a moderate oven; crush and pound them lightly in a
mortar. Rub the duck inside and out with half the salt, ginger and
pepper. Leave to dry and season overnight. Mix the remaining
seasoning with the lard until well-blended. Rub the mixture on the
duck inside and out. Place the duck on a wire rack in a preheated
moderate oven at about 400 deg (put a drip-pan underneath) and roast
for 1 hour. SMOKING: Light the charcoal fire. When the charcoal is
glowing red, but not blazing, sprinkle half the tea, sugar and
camphor wood (twigs or sawdust) over the fire. Place the duck on a
wire rack and suspend it a couple of inches above the fire. Invert
the tin or bin over the duck and fire and let smoke for 10 minutes.
Turn the duck over for a further 10 minute smoking, sprinkling the
rest of the smoking mixture on the fire and poking and stirring it.
By now the duck should be sufficiently smoked. Brush it with 2 tb
sesame oil and put it in a moderate oven for a further 15 minutes of
roasting. Serve by chopping through the bones into 15-20 large
bite-size pieces or carve in the western manner. An excellent
accompaniment to wine at the start or a multi-course dinner party or
banquet. Adapted from a recipe from the Chengtu Dining Rooms,
Chengtu. From Chinese Regional Cooking by Kenneth Lo, Pantheon Books,
1979.
