Title: Grilled Sweet Red Onions
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
-ground
2 tb (To 3) Olive Oil, Extra
-Virgin
1 tb Parsley -- chopped
4 md Red Onions
1/4 c  Olive Oil
1/2 ts Kosher Salt
1/8 ts Black Pepper -- freshly
1. Preheat the oven to 400 F.

2. Peel the onions and cut them into slices 3/4 inch thick. On a
lightly oiled cookie sheet or roasting pan, neatly arrange the onion
slices in rows. Be sure to keep the rings of each slice intact and
don't crowd the slices. Evenly drizzle the remaining olive oil onto
each of the onion slices and season with the salt and pepper.

3. Roast in the oven for 35 to 40 mins, until the onions are softened
and very lightly browned. (The recipe can be done ahead up to this
point. Allow the onions to cool, then store them, tightly covered in
the refrigerator, until ready to use. They will keep up to 3 days.)

4. Just before serving, heat a grill or grill pan until very hot. Use
a spatula to place the onion slices on the grill, taking care that
the rings stay intact. Cook 3 to 5 mins a side to give the onions
attractive grill marks and a delicious smoky flavor. Arrange the
grilled onions on a platter, drizzle on the extra-virgin olive oil,
sprinkle with the chopped parsley, and serve. Serves 4 to 6.
