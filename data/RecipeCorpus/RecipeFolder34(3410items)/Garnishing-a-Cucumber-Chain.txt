1.  The cucumber chain garnish presents a most pleasing decoration,
not to mention a tasty one, when used to encircle a fish entre or
when run around the outside of an appetizer and relish tray.  Cut
both ends of a mdium sized cucumber to create flat surfaces.  The the
food decorator tool, run the strip cutter opening of the tool down
the length of the unpeeled cucumber.

2.  Use the twin curl cutter to hollow out the center of the
vegetable. Since the cucumber has a soft center, the twin curl cutter
will not produce solid curls, but this tool still does a neat job of
hollowing out the vegetable.

3. After you have hollowed the cucumber, cut it into 1/4 inch thick
slices. Spread the cucumber slices out and make a small cut from the
center of the slice to the outside.  Do this to every other cucumber
slice and link the slices together to form a chain.
