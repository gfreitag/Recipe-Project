Title: STIR-FRIED BITTER MELON
Categories: Vegetables, Indian
Yield: 6 servings
2 1/2 ts Panchphoran powder
-(Indian five-spice)
1/8 ts Cayenne
1 1/4 lb Bitter melon
2 tb Salt; plus 3/4 ts
3 md Onion
5 tb Oil
Trim the pointed ends of the melons and then halve them the long way.
Scoop out the seeds and discard.  Cut the outer shells crosswise, on
the bias, into 1/4" wide strips.  In a bowl, stir two tablespoons
salt into four cups of water.  Put in the melon strips and let them
soak two hours, then drain, rinse under running water, and pat dry.

Peel the onions, halve longwise, and slice into fine half-rings.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over a medium flame.  When hot, add
the panchphoran and stir for ten seconds, to infuse the oil.  Add the
onions; stir-fry for two minutes.  Add the melon strips, the
remaining salt, and the cayenne.  Stir-fry for 10 to 12 minutes, or
until the melon is tender.
