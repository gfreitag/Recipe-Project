Title: GINGERSNAP-PEACH CRISP - Country Living
Categories: Country liv, Desserts, Fruit, Microwave
Yield: 4 servings
8    Gingersnap cookies
2 tb Chopped walnuts
2 ts Vegetable od
2 lb Peaches or nectarines,
-peeled, pitted, and sliced
2 tb Firmly packed light-brown
-sugar
1. In 1-quart microwave-safe dish, combine peaches and brown sugar;
set aside. Place gingersnap cookies in clear plastic bag and seal.
With rolling pin, crush gingersnaps to make crumbs. (We do this by
hand and not in a food processor to ensure that we get crumbs and not
large chunks amid fine dust.) Add walnuts and oil to gingersnap
crumbs in bag, rubbing mixture to blend.

2. Sprinkle gingersnap mixture over peach mixture; cover and
microwave on high (100 percent) 3 minutes. Uncover and microwave on
high (100 percent) 2 minutes longer. (If microwave does not have
carousel, rotate dish after the first 3 minutes.) Cool crisp 20 to 25
minutes before serving.
