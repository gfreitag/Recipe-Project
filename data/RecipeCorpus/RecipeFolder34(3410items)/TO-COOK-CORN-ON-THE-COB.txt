Steamed corn: Take your largest pot, fill with water (no salt), and
bring to vig- orous boil: Remove layer of outer husk (leaving inner
layers of husk on) and drop ears, 4 to 8 at a time, in boiling water.
Leave for no more than 30 seconds. Drain ears well and place on a
platter.

Microwaved corn: Cook with husk on at the highest setting. Again,
you're steaming them in their  husk.  At 700 watts, cook one ear for
2 minutes and two ears for 5; at 400 watts, cook one ear for 3
minutes and two ears for 8. If cooking more than two ears, cooking
times are too long, so go with another method.
