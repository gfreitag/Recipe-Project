1. To make fresh tomato sauce, in large skillet, heat 2 T olive oil
over medium-low heat. Add whole garlic cloves and cook, turning
occasionally, until cloves are golden and soft about 10 minutes.
Remove garlic from oil and mash with a fork; set aside.

2. Add onion to skillet and saute until golden. Add tomatoes, salt,
and sugar; partially cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until
tomatoes soften and mixture becomes a chunky sauce. Remove from heat
and stir in reserved garlic.

3. Meanwhile, trim ends off zucchini. Slice lengthwise into
1/8-inch-thick slices. Discard outer skin-covered slices.

4. In large, shallow microwave-safe dish, toss zucchini slices with
pepper and garlic powder. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and
microwave on high (100 percent) 2 to 3 minutes or until flexible
enough for rolling. Uncover, drain, and toss zucchini with lemon
juice and remaining tablespoon olive oil. Or, steam zucchini slices 3
to 4 minutes or until flexible; drain zucchini and toss with pepper,
garlic powder, lemon juice, and olive oil.

5. Place zucchini slices flat on work surface; top with thin slices of
prosciutto and roll up to enclose proscuitto. To serve, spread tomato
sauce in deep serving plate; arrange rolls in tomato sauce. Garnish
with basil, if desired, and serve.

Note: If yellow zucchini is not available, substitute one evenly
shaped yellow summer squash.
