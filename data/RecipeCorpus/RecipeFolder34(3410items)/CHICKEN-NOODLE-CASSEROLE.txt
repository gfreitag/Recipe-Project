Title: CHICKEN NOODLE CASSEROLE
Categories: Poultry, Casseroles, Main dish, Pasta/rice
Yield: 1 servings
2 cn Cream of Chicken soup
2/3 c  Milk
3 c  Cubed cooked chicken
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Buttered bread crumbs
8 oz Wide egg noodles
1 1/2 c  Chopped celery
1/2 c  Chopped green pepper
1/4 c  Chopped onion
2 c  Shredded cheddar cheese
1/4 c  Butter
Prepare noodles according to package directions.  Drain.  In a large
skillet, cook celery, green pepper and onion in butter until tender.
Stir in soup, milk and cheese.  Cook and stir until cheese melts.
Combine egg noodles, cheese sauce, chicken and salt. Pour into a 3
quart casserole. Top with bread crumbs. Bake in a 350 degree oven for
30 to 40 minutes. Note: This is my favorite chicken noodle casserole.
You could probably even substitute drained solid white tuna for the
chicken, probably 2 or 3 12-oz. cans. - Debbie Carlson Serves: 6
