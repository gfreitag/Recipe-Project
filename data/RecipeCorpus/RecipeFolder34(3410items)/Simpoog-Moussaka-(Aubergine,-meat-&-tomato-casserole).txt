Note (IMH) The authentic meat to use in the recipe is lamb (mutton),
but ground beef may also be used if ground lamb is unavailable.
Remove stems and hulls from aubergines (eggplants), cut crosswise
into 1/2" slices Sprinkle generously both sides with salt, layer into
a sieve or colander, weight and leave to disgorge 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a heavy frying pan (skillet) heat 1/4 of the butter
over moderate heat. Add the onion and saute (sweat) until soft but
not browned, stirring frequently. Raise the heat and add the meat.
Cook until lightly browned, breaking up any lumps with back of the
spoon. Stir in the tomatoes, cinnamon (or herbs) and salt & pepper.
Cook 5 minutes, or a little longer, then set aside until aubergines
are done.
Dry the aubergine slices carefully with fresh paper towels. Saute
(fry) in the remaining butter until golden brown on both sides. (you
may have to use more oil or butter if this gets absorbed). Arrange
half the aubergine slices in the bottom of a buttered baking dish.
Spread the meat mixture over them and cover with the remaining
eggplant slices. Cover and bake in a preheated 375F oven 35 minutes.
Beat the eggs until frothy. Uncover the dish, pour the beaten egg
over (top now with optional cheese and paprika) and bake 15 minutes.
Serve with plain or tomato rice pilaff.
