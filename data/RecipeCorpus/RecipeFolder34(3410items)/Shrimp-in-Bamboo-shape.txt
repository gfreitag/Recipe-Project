Title: Shrimp in Bamboo shape
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 5 servings
1 c  Cornstarch
3    Eggs
Peanut oil for frying
24 lg Shrimp
1 1/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Sesame seed oil
1) Peel and devein the shrimp, but leave the last tail segment intact.
Rinse the shrimp and pat dry. Give each shrimp a slight gash
crosswise at the top.

2) Sprinkle the shrimp with 1 ts salt and sesame oil and rub it in.

3) Dip the shrimp, one at a time, into the cornstarch.

4) Put 1/2 c of the leftover cornstarch in a bowl and add the egg and
the remaining salt. Mix well with the fingers.

5) Heat the oil for deep frying in a wok until it is hot and almost

mixture, then slide them into the hot oil. Cook, turning the shrimp,
until golden brown all over, about 2 minutes. As the shrimp are
browned, remove and drain on paper towels.

6) Return all the shrimp to the hot oil and deep fry about 1 minute
longer. Drain and serve hot.
