For lamb: Combine first 5 ingredients in large nonaluminum baking
pan. Add lamb, turning to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 4
hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 325'F. Fill 8x8-inch baking pan with coarse salt. Set
fennel in salt. Roast until just tender, about 90 minutes. Cut into
quarters.

Increase oven temperature to 375'F. Heat 1/4 C oil in heavy ovenproof
skillet over medium heat. Add fennel quarters. Season with salt and
pepper and toss to coat with oil. Roast in oven until crisp, about 25
minutes.

Meanwhile, remove lamb from marinade. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat remaining 1/4 C oil in another heavy large skillet over medium
heat. Add lamb and brown well on all sides. Surround lamb with
potatoes, tossing in oil to coat. Transfer to oven and roast meat to
desired doneness, about 20 minutes for medium-rare.

For sauce: Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add
shallots and next 4 ingredients and cook until shallots are
translucent, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add stock and
simmer until sauce is reduced by half, stirring occasionally.

Remove lamb from skillet. Cut meat off bone, removing each loin in 1
piece. Cut each piece of meat into thin slices. Divide slices among
plates.

Toss dates with potatoes. Divide among plates. Set 1 fennel quarter
on each plate. Spoon sauce over lamb.

*Lamb Stock - makes 2 cups. Preheat oven to 400'F. Place bones in
heavy large roasting pan and roast until well browned, turning bones
occasionally, about 30 minutes. Pour off drippings from pan. Add 2 C
water to pan and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits.
Transfer contents of roasting pan to heavy large saucepan.

Add 4 C water and all remaining ingredients. Simmer until liquid is
reduced to 2 cups, about 1 1/2 hours. Strain stock through sieve,
pressing on solids. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover and
refrigerate.)
