Title: Individual Pizzas
Categories: Appetizers, Italian
Yield: 1 servings
2    Onions
Parmesan cheese
2 1/2 lb Ground chuck
Red peppers -- crushed
16    English muffins
Garlic
Butter
Salt & pepper
1.  Split, toast, and butter the muffins. Saute thinly diced onions
with the ground chuck, then add the seasonings. Spoon the mixture
onto the muffins. 2. Cover generously with Parmesan cheese and bake
at 350 degrees to the desired degree of doneness. 3. These can be
frozen and heated from their frozen state. I sometimes add mushrooms,
different cheeses, pepperoni, anchovies, bell peppers, sausage and
anything else I get my hands on, and make a few of each kind.
