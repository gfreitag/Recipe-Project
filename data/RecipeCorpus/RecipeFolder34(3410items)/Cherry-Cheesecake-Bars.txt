Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 12 servings
MMMMM----------------------------BASE---------------------------------
Temp
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1    Egg white -- for glazing
1 c  Flour
3 tb Powdered sugar
7 tb Unsalted butter -- at room
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
2    Egg yolks
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 ts Flour
1/2 c  Sour cherries -- drained
8 oz Cream cheese -- at room temp
1 c  Sour cream -- at room temp.
7 tb Sugar
Preheat the oven to 350.  Lightly grease an 8" baking pan.  For the
base, process the flour and powdered sugar in a food processor for
several seconds.  Add the butter and vanilla and process until the
dough comes together, 20 to 30 seconds.  Pat the dough gently over
the bottom of the prepared pan and about 1 1/2" up the sides.  Glaze
it with the egg white. Pour off the excess.  Bake the base on the
center oven rack until lightly golden, about 30 minutes.  Place the
base in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to cool completely.  Keep the
oven on.  Meanwhile prepare the topping:  Wrap the cherries in paper
towels to absorb any liquid.  Place the remaining topping ingredients
in a food processor and process until blended, about 15 seconds.
Pour the topping evenly over the base, then arrange the cherries
evenly on the topping.  Bake the bars on the center oven rack until
set, about 1 hour.  Allow them to cool completely, then refrigerate
overnight.  The next day cut the bars with a sharp knife that is
dipped in hot water and wiped dry before each cut.  Allow the bars to
warm to room temperature before serving.
