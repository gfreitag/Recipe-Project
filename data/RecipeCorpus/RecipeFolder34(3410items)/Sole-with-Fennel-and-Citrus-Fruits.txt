Title: Sole with Fennel and Citrus Fruits
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
-(1 1/2 lb total)
Salt and pepper to taste
8    Wooden toothpicks
2 tb Butter, softened
1 lg Shallot
-peeled and minced
1 lg Fennel bulb
4    Navel oranges
1    Lemon
-zested and juiced
1    Lime
-zested and juiced
8 sm Sole fillets
Preheat oven to 400F.

Remove and discard the fennel stalks from the bulb. Halve the bulb
and cut out the core. With the flat side against the cutting board
and along the natural grain of the bulb, slice the fennel into thin
strips. In a steamer tray, above 1 inch of boiling water, cook the
fennel until it begins to soften, 4-5 minutes. Remove from the
steamer and set aside.

Grate the zest from one of the oranges. Peel and segment all of the
oranges. Combine the orange, lemon and lime zests, set aside half for
sprinkling over the finished dish.

Lay each fillet of sole flat on the work surface and season lightly
with salt and pepper. Set one-eighth of the fennel and a sprinkle of
the citrus zest mixture across the tail end of each piece. Starting
at the tail end, roll the fillet around the fennel-zest mixture.
Secure with a toothpick. Repeat with remaining fillets.

Rub a 9x13-inch baking dish with the butter. Add the shallots, lemon
juice and lime juice. Arrange the stuffed sole fillets in the dish,
seam side down, scattering the orange segments over the fish. Bake,
uncovered, in the preheated oven until the fish is opaque throughout,
15-20 minutes.

Transfer 2 fillets to each dinner plate, spoon the cooking juices and
orange segments over each fillet and garnish with the reserved citrus
zest.
