Title: Praline Cookies
Categories: Cajun/creol, Desserts, Cake/cookie
Yield: 2 dozen
1    Egg white
1 ts Vanilla
2 c  Pecan halves
1 c  Brown sugar (light, dark or
A mixture)
1 tb All purpose flour
ds Salt
Preheat oven to 325.  Grease cookie sheets very thoroughly.

Break up any lumps in the sugar and mix in the flour and salt.  Beat
the egg white until stiff but not dry and fold in the sugar mixture.
Fold in the vanilla and pecans.  The dough should cling to the nuts.

Drop the dough by small teaspoons onto the cookie sheets, leaving
about two inches between each cookie.  Bake for about 20 minutes or
until lightly browned.

Remove from the cookie sheets immediately and  cool on racks.

Should a cookie stick to the baking sheet, return the sheet to the
oven for a few seconds to loosen the cookie.

Do NOT double recipe - make two separate recipes.
