omelet over filling to make a roll. Place omelet on flat plate and
cool to room temperalure. Repeat to make a second omelet with
remaining eggs and Ratatouille.

4. When omelets have cooled, cut each crosswise into 4 pieces. Arrange
omelet pieces on serving plate. Garnish with basil sprigs, if desired.
