Categories: Country liv, Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 8 halves
1/4 ts Ground white pepper
4    Large (about 2 lb) ripe
Tomatoes ('Northern
-Exposure')
1/2 c  Diced seeded cucumber
1/2 c  Long-grain white rice
3 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
1 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Dried basil (opt.)
1/2 ts Salt
1. In 2-quart saucepan, heat 2 inches water to boiling over high
heat. Add rice and return water to boiling. Reduce heat to
medium-high and cook rice uncovered, stirring occasionally, until
tender-about 15 minutes. Drain rice in strainer and rinse with cold
water. Drain rice well. Return to saucepan and add oil, lemon juice,
basil, if desired, the salt, and pepper; toss and set aside.

2. Meanwhile, cut each tomato crosswise in half. With fingertips,
scoop out and discard seeds, leaving pulp. With knife, carefully cut
out pulp, leaving tomato shells. Dice enough tomato pulp to measure 1
C. Add tomato pulp and cucumber to rice mixture; toss until well
mixed.

3. Fill tomato shells with rice mixture and arrange on serving plate.
Serve immediately or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until
ready to serve-no longer than 4 hours ahead because the rice will
harden.
