Title: Ant killer
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 servings
1    Confectionary sugar
1    Potato flour
This remedy is said to work good as an ant killer. Try to mix even
parts of those ingredients. A sieve could be of a good help maybe?
It must be served under completely dry conditiones, as the sugar
makes the ant eat this stuff and the potato flour dries out the ant.
Not harmful for people!
