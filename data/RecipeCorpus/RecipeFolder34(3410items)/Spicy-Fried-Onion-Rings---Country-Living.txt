Title: Spicy Fried Onion Rings - Country Living
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables, Country liv
Yield: 4 servings
-frying
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Ground red pepper
1/4 ts Ground cumin
1/4 ts Chili powder
2 lb Onions, cut into 1/4-inch
-slices & separated into
-rings
1/2 c  Unsifted all purpose flour
Vegetable oil for deep-fat
NOTE: Restaurants fry their onion rings in metal baskets so the
onions will assume that shape-either loaves or mounds.  If you have a
round frying basket, use that to fry the onions.  If not, just fry
them in batches and mound on the plate afterward.

In large plastic food storage bag, toss half of the onion rings and
half of the flour until well mixed.

Heat oven to 200F.  Line a baking sheet with paper towels.  In a
4-quart pan, heat 2 inches oil to 350F on a deep fat thermometer.  In
a cup, mix salt, red peppr, cumin and chili powder.

Drop floured onions rings, a handful at a time, in hot oil.  (Do  not
fry too much at a time because the oil wil bubble up.)  Fry, turning
them once, until crisp and lightly browned-about 2 minutes. Drain
onions on paper towels and transfer to paper-lined baking sheet.
Repeat to fry remaining floured onions. Sprinkle fried onions lightly
with half of salt mixture and place in oven to keep warm.

Toss remaining onions with remaining flour.  Fry onions as above and
sprinkle with remaining salt mixture.  After all onions are fried,
mound them highon a small serving plate.
