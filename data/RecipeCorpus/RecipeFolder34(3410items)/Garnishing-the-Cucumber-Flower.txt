The cucumber flour is not only a pleasing garnish but also one that is
easy to make.

1.  Select a well rounded cucumber and cut 2 inch pieces from each
end of the vegetables.  Cut the outside skin into scalloped shapes to
form the petals.

2. Scoop out the center pulp of each piece with either a melon baller
or a small spoon. Place the scallope pieces into ice water for 15
minutes to allow the petals to open.

3. When the cucumber flower is ready to serve, remove them from the
ice water and fill the centers with softened cream cheese, smoke
flavored cheese, ham spread, shredded carrots or cooked green peas.
These vegetable flowers can also be used to hold tartar sauce for
fish dinner, mayonnaise or mustard for sandwich plates.
