Categories: Breads, Sourdough
Yield: 48 servings
3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 pk Yeast
1 c  Warm milk
1/2 c  Melted butter
2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Honey, brown sugar, or
Molasses
2 c  Cracked wheat or steel cut
Oats
2 c  Boiling water
1/4 c  Honey, brown sugar, or
Molasses
1 1/2 c  Sourdough starter
2 c  All-purpose flour
3 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
Measure the steel cut oatmeal or cracked wheat into a large mixing
bowl. Add boiling water and 1/4 c honey, brown sugar, or molasses,
stirring until well blended.  Cool to lukewarm.  When the cereal
mixture is cooled, add the sourdough starter and 2 cups of white
flour, beating until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and a clean
towel. Let stand overnight in a warm, protected spot.

The next morning, combine the whole wheat and white flours.  Sprinkle
yeast over the warm milk, stirring with a fork until dissolved.  Stir
down the starter sponge with a rubber spatula.  Add the yeast
mixture, butter, salt, and choice of sugar, blending thoroughly.  Add
sufficient flour mixture to make a soft, workable dough.  Turn out on
a floured surface.  Knead 8-10 minutes, adding more flour as
necessary.  Place dough in a warm, greased bowl, turning to coat the
top.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and towel. Let double in bulk,
about 2 hours.

Punch down and knead lightly.  Cover and let rest 10 minutes.  Shape
in 4 loaves and place in greased loaf pans.  Cover with a towel and
let rise to tops of ans, 45 minutes to an hour.  Bake in a preheated
350 degree oven for 45 to 50 minutes. Cool on racks. Brush with
melted butter if desired.
