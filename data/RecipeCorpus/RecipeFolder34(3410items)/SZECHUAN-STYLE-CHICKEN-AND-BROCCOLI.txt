Title: SZECHUAN-STYLE CHICKEN AND BROCCOLI
Categories: Chinese, Meats, Poultry
Yield: 4 servings
1 tb Cornstarch
1 1/2 c  Broccoli flowerets
1/2 ts Sugar
1    Red pepper
3 tb Vegetable oil
1    Onion; thin wedges
2    Chicken breasts*
-- split; boned and skinned
1/3 c  Pace picante sauce
20    Milliliters garlic; minced
2 tb Soy sauce
1 tb Ginger; shredded
1 tb Water
(We use much less meat than this; either 1 whole chicken breast or
1/2 lb. ground turkey or ground chicken.) Cut chicken into 1-inch
cubes. Combine picante sauce, soy sauce, water, cornstarch and sugar
in small bowl; set aside. Heat 2 T. of the oil in wok or large
skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken and stir-fry 3 to 4
minutes or until cooked through. Remove with slotted spoon. Add
remaining oil onion, garlic and ginger to skillet; stir-fry 30
seconds. Add broccoli and peppers; stir-fry 3 minutes or until
vegetables are crisp-tender. Add chicken and picante sauce mixture;
stir-fry about 1 minute or until sauce thickens.

I don't cook the meat and vegetables separately. It takes a little
longer, but there are less dishes to wash and you only need 2 T. oil.
I cook the garlic and ginger for a few seconds before throwing the
meat in. I cook the meat for 20 or 30 seconds, and then throw in the
vegetables one at a one at a time, stirring 5 or 6 seconds between
each addition. I cook everything for 5 or 6 minutes, stirring, of
course. Then I pull everything up on the sides of the wok and pour
the sauce in the center, stirring the sauce until thickened. Then I
stir everything together for a minute or two. It's done. I use high
on my stove when cooking with my wok on a fire-ring. This is easy and
delicious and lower in sodium than many of the bottled sauces. This
recipe is from the Pace Picante Sauce 40th Anniversary Recipe
Collection.  Tish in Wichita FROM:
