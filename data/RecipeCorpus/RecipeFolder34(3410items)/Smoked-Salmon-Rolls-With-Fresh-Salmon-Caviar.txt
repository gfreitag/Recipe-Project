Title: Smoked Salmon Rolls With Fresh Salmon Caviar
Categories: Fish/seafoo, Appetizers, Canadian
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/4 c  Whipping cream
Salt to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
Salmon roe
Fresh dill
1 lb Cold smoked salmon
3 1/2    Sheets of leaf gelatin
1/3 c  Fish stock
2 tb Unsalted butter
1/4 ts Worcestershire sauce
Chill all equipment including bowl and blade of the food processor.
Slice half the salmon into 3" x 6" rectangles. Place each on a piece
of plastic wrap; refrigerate. Chop remaining salmon coarsely; set
aside.

Soften leaf gelatin in a bowl of cold water until pliable, about 5
minutes. Warm fish stock in a small saucepan. Drain and squeeze
excess moisture from leaf gelatin; add to the fish stock, stirring to
dissolve completely. Refrigerate until cool, but not set.

Puree salmon chunks and butter in food processor until smooth. Add
fish stock, Tabasco and Worcestershire sauces. Process until blended.
Transfer to a large stainless steel bowl. In a separate chilled bowl,
whip cream until it forms soft peaks. Fold into salmon mixture in
halves. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Spoon about 1" layer of salmon mousse into the centre of each salmon
rectangle. Roll the slice of salmon around the mousse with the help
of the plastic wrap, until each edge meets. Twist ends of wrap
tightly; chill rolls at least 1 1/2 hours before serving.

To serve, unwrap rolls and place on a chilled plate. Garnish with a
small spoonful of salmon roe and a sprig of dill.
