Title: Yogurt-On-A-Stick
Categories: Diabetic, Desserts, Kids
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick spray
4    Ice cream sticks; (optional)
12 oz Fruit-flavored, low-fat
-- yogurt, blended, or with
-- fruit on bottom
Carefully remove the yogurt from containers.  Lightly spray four
clean 8-oz cups (non-stick styrofoam paper cups are fine) with
nonstick spray. This will help the Yogurt-On-A-Stick pop out when
frozen.

Fill the containers about half full with equal amounts of yogurt.  If
you are using sticks, partially freeze yogurt until they hold the
sticks upright (about hour).  Place sticks in them, and finish the
freezing process.

OR, allow yogurt to freeze completely, without sticks, then squeeze
it up from the bottom to eat.

ONE SERVING:  One Yogurt-On-A-Stick 1/4 of the nutrients on the yogurt
container.
