-softened
1/2 ts Salt
1    1-lb carton dry cottage
-cheese
2 lg Egg yolks, wel1-beaten
3 tb Sugar
MMMMM---------------------------CREPES--------------------------------
-all wel1-beaten
Vegetable oil for frying
Sour cream or applesauce, or
-cinnamon and sugar (opt.)
1 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 1/2 c  Milk
2 lg Eggs plus 2 large egg whites
1  Prepare Filling: In large bowl, using potato masher or 2 forks,
mash cottage cheese, beaten egg yolks, sugar, butter, and salt
together until smooth. Set aside.

2. Prepare Crepes: In large bowl, using whisk, mix flour and salt;
beat in milk, whole eggs, and egg whites until smooth. Using a
10-inch skillet, for each crepe, heat a very small amount of oil in
pan until hot. Pour 1/3 C of crepe batter into pan; tip pan from side
to side until batter covers bottom of pan. Fry until crepe just
begins to brown on one side; flip crepe over with spatula and fry
until just browned on second side. Repeat to make 7 more crepes.
Stack crepes with sheets of waxed paper between each one and let cool.

3. Heat oven to 350'F. Place about a 1/4 C Filling in each crepe and
fold as an envelope-fold the bottom up, the sides in, and the top
down-to form a blintz. Then grease a pan or baking dish with a little
butter or margarine. Arrange blintzes in pan in single layer and
cover with sheet of aluminum foil or a sturdy lid.

4. Bake blintzes 30 minutes or until puffed and centers feel firm when
gently touched. Serve plain or, if desired, with sour cream or
applesauce, or cinnamon and sugar.

Note: Blintzes may be stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for
several days or in the freezer for up to a month before using.
