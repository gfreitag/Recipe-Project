Yield: 4 servings

The vibrant yellow blossoms of zucchini and other squash are
delicious when dipped in batter and fried.  The very large ones can
be stuffed.

Peel the stems of the squash blossoms.  Heat the oil in a large, heavy
frying pan over medium heat.  Add the garlic and saute, stirring,
until lightly brown.  Add squash blossoms, oregano, salt and pepper.
Cook slowly, stirring frequently, 5 to 8 minutes, or until the stems
are soft.

Serve immediately.
