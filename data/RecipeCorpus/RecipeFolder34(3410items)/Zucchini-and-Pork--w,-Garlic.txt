Categories: Newspaper, Vegetables, Meats, Casseroles
Yield: 8 servings
2 md Zucchini; cut into 1-inch
.  thick slices
1 c  Corn kernals
1 c  Monterey Jack cheese;
.  shredded
1 1/2 lb Pork tenderloin; thin slices
1 c  Garlic cloves; minced
Salt to taste
1 lg Onion; chopped
1 c  Tomato puree
1 tb Chili powder
Place the pork in a heavy, oval casserole and cook over high heat
until browned.  When almost brown, sprinkle with the garlic and salt.
Toss and add the onion and tomato puree.  Cover, reduce heat to low
and cook 1 hour; slow cooking will keep the garlic from overpowering
the dish.

Add the chili powder, zucchini and corn, cover and cook 20 minutes
more. Cover with shredded cheese, which will melt on top.  Serve hot.
