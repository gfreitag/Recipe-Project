their puree, breaking up the tomatoes with a spoon. Bring to a
simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring often, until the

cornmeal and 1/2 cup of water. Stir the cornmeal mixture and the pink

chili is thickened, about 10 minutes. (The chli can be made up to 3
days ahead. If desired, scrape off and discard the solidified fat
that rises to the surface. Reheat the chili gently on top of the
stove before serving.) Makes about 25 servings.
