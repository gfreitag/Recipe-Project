Title: Peanut Butter Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 12 servings
3    Eggs
1 c  Whole milk
3 ts Baking powder
2 1/3 c  Flour
1 c  Light brown sugar
1/2 c  Margarine
2 tb Margarine
1 c  Peanut butter
Cream sugar, margarine, and peanut butter.  Add eggs and beat.  Mix
flour and baking powder and add alternately with milk, ending with
milk.  Batter will be thick.

Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans and pour in batter.  Bake at 350
degrees for 30-35 minutes.

NOTES : Contributor frosted this with pink icing and served it for
valentines day.  I made a banana icing, which worked well, chocolate
would probably work also.

Substituted butter for margarine, and cake was a bit dry.  Try
shortening or shortening/butter combination next time.
