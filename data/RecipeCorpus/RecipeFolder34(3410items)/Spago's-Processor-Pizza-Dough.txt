Title: Spago's Processor Pizza Dough
Categories: Pizza
Yield: 2 servings
1 tb Honey
2 tb Olive oil
3/4 c  (to 1 cup) water
3 c  Flour -- all-purpose
1 pk Dry yeast
1 ts Salt
Place the flour and yeast in food processor.  Process briefly to mix.
Combine salt, honey, olive oil, and 3/4 cup of water in small bowl or
measuring cup.  Mix well. With motor running, slowly pour liquid
through feed tube of food processor. Process until dough forms a ball
on the blade, using additional water if necessary. Transfer dough to
a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Place in oiled bowl
and allow dough to rest, covered, for 30 minutes. Divide dough into 4
equal parts. Roll each piece into a smooth, tight ball. Place on flat
sheet or dish, covered with a damp towel, and refrigerate until
baking time. One hour before baking, remove dough from frig and bring
to room temperature. Lightly flour work surface.  Using the fleshy
part of your fingertips, flatten each dough ball into a circle,
approximately 6 inches in diameter, leaving outer edge thicker than
the center. Lift the dough from the work surface and gently stretch
the edges working clockwise to form an 8 inch circle. Place on a
pizza paddle or baking sheet.
