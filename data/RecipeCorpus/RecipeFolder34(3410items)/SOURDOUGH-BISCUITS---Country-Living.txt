Title: SOURDOUGH BISCUITS - Country Living
Categories: Country liv, Breads
Yield: 4 biscuits
1/2 ts Sugar
3/4 c  Sourdough starter (see Note)
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
2 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
2 ts Baking powder
3/4 ts Salt
1. Heat oven to 375'F. Grease small baking sheet.

2. In medium-size bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, and
sugar. Stir in starter and oil to form a soft dough.

3. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 2 to 3
times. Divide dough into 4 pieces. Pat each piece out on greased
baking sheet to a 4-inch round. If desired, cut biscuits with a 4
inch-round cutter to produce straight edges.

4. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.

Note: For this recipe, the sourdough starter should be the
consistency of pourable pancake batter. If you have starter that is
thicker, thin some of it with water until it is pourable.

To make sourdough starter from commercial yeast: In a pitcher or bowl,
combine 2 C unsifted all-purpose flour, 3 T sugar, 1 package active
dry yeast, and 1/2 t salt. Add 2 C warm water and beat with a wooden
spoon until fairly smooth. Cover loosely with waxed paper; set in
warm place for 24 hours. Stir mixture twice during this fermentation
stage. Store starter, loosely covered, in refrig- erator. To use,
stir and remove starter needed for recipe. Replenish by stirring in
equal amounts of water and flour; let stand at room temperature
several hours, then stir and return to refrigerator. Dried sourdough
cultures, which vary in flavor and leavening power, can be purchased
by phone from Sourdoughs International, Inc., (800) 888-9567; or by
mail from Pat's Sourdough, Box 944, Douglas, Wyo. 82633. Both sources
have sourdough cookbooks available for purchase.
