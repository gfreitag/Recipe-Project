2 tb Granulated instant coffee
3/4 c  Semisweet chocolate morsels.
2 c  Whipping cream
1/2 c  Powdered sugar
Preheat oven to 350.  Prepare crust as follows:

In small mixing bowl, cut shortening into flour until mixutre is
consistency of corn meal.  Add water and stir to combine;  form a
small ball of dough. In bowl of food processor fitted with metal
blade, combine dough, brown sugar, pecans, chocolate chips and
vanilla. Process to chop mixture coarsely.  Expect some large chunks
to be left. Press crust mixture into 9-in pie pan to cover bottom and
half of side. Bake 6-8 minutes or until just slightly brown.  Allow
shell to cool completely.

Prepare filling as follows:

In small saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate pieces in 1/4 cup
cream, stirring frequently, until mixture is smooth.  Set aside to
cool.  In large bowl of mixer, combine remaining whipping cream,
powdered sugar and coffee granules and beat until cream thickens and
forms peaks.  Fold chocolate mixture into whipped cream by hand.  Do
not over-mix because cream has a tendency to break up after chocolate
is added.  Pour filling into prepared pie crust, smoothing top.
Freeze filling at least 1 hour.

Prepare topping:

In large bowl of mixer, combine whipping cream, powdered sugar and
instant coffee granules.  Beat at high speed until stiff.  Mound over
filling, smoothing surface.  Sprinkle chocolate morsels over top and
freeze until solid.  Serve frozen.  Makes one 9-inch pie.
