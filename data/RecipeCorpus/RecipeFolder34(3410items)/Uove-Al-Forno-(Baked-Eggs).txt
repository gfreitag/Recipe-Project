Title: Uove Al Forno (Baked Eggs)
Categories: Cheese/eggs
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 lb Fresh Mozzarella -- thinly
-sliced
8 lg Eggs
1/8 ts Kosher Salt
Black Pepper -- freshly
Ground
3 tb Olive Oil
1 ts Garlic -- minced
1/8 ts Red Pepper Flakes -- dried
8 c  Mixed Greens, Cleaned * --
-cut in 1 - 2" pieces
1/4 c  Water
1/4 lb Coppa ** -- thinly sliced
* Choose your greens from mustard greens, Swiss chards, dandelion, and
spinach.

** If you can't find coppa, substitute soppressata or Genoa salami.

1. Preheat the oven to 450 F.

2. In a skillet large enough to hold all the greens, combine the
olive oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Cook over moderately high
heat for about 45 seconds to flavor the oil, but do not allow the
garlic to brown. Add the greens and the water and cook, stirring
constantly, until the greens have wilted, 3 to 4 mins.

3. Transfer the greens to a shallow, 10-inch ovenproof gratin dish or
casserole. Arrange the coppa atop the greens in a circle around the
outside of the gratin dish, leaving the center open for the eggs. Lay
the mozzarella slices on top of the coppa. Carefully crack the eggs
onto the greens in the center of the dish. Some of the eggs with salt
and pepper. Bake for 10 to 12 mins, or until the whites are set and
the yolks still slightly runny. Serve immediately in the gratin dish.
