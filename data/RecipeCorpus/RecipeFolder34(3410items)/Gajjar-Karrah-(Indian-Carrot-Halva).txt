Categories: Desserts, Indian, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
2 tb Honey
180 g  Sugar
60 g  Almonds
;blanched and slivered
Splash of rose water
;optional
Cream
700 g  Carrots
1/2 ts Saffron threads
1 tb Boiling water
2.3 liters milk
1    Cinnamon stick, 2 cm
3    Cardamom seeds, bruised
60 g  Raisins or sultanas
60 g  Butter
Grate 700 g carrots. Steep 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads in 1
tablespoon boiling water. Bring 2.3 L milk to the boil. Add the
carrots and a 2 cm stick of cinnamon and boil for a minute longer,
stirring. Turn down heat to a fast simmer - as fast as can be
maintained without the milk boiling over - and stir as often as
possible (the more the better), until the milk has reduced to less
than a quarter. (It helps to have a good book in the kitchen.) Add 3
cardamom seeds, bruised, the saffron liquid and 60 g raisins or
sultanas. Mix and keep stirring 'til the mixture is dry. Fish out the
cardamom seeds and the cinnamon if you can find them. Add 60 g butter
and stir in well. Add 2 tablespoons honey and 180 g sugar. Cook for
another 9 minutes or so until the mixture is translucent. Add 60 g
blanched slivered almonds and a splash of rose water (optional).
Serve hot or cold with pouring cream.
