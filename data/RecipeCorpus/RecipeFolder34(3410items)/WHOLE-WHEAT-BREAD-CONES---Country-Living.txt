Title: WHOLE-WHEAT BREAD CONES - Country Living
Categories: Country liv, Breads
Yield: 8 servings
1 1/2 c  To 2 C unsifted all-purpose
-flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 lg Egg
1 tb Water
1 c  Milk
1 pk Active dry yeast
3 tb Sugar
3 tb Butter, melted
1 c  Whole-wheat flour
1. In small saucepan, heat milk until bubbles form around side of
pan. Pour milk into large bowl; set aside to cool to 110' to 115'F,
then stir in yeast and 1 T sugar. Let mixture stand until foamy-5
minutes.

2. Add remaining 2 T sugar, the butter, wholewheat flour, 1 C
all-purpose flour, and salt to milk mixture. With wooden spoon, stir
mixture until a soft dough forms, adding more all-purpose flour, if
necessary, to make dough manageable.

3. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead dough, adding
more flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic-8 minutes.

4. Wash, dry, and lightly oil mixing bowl. Place dough in oiled bowl,
turning to bring oiled side up. Cover with clean cloth; let dough
rise in warm place, away from drafts, until double in size-about 1
hour.

5. With floured rolling pin, roll dough to an 18by 12-inch rectangle.
Cut dough into eight 11/2by 18-inch strips.

6. Grease 2 baking sheets and the outside of 8 metal cream roll cone
molds. Starting, at the pointed end of one mold, begin wrapping a
strip of dough around mold in a spiral fashion, overlapping each turn
1/4 inch. Pinch dough together at the pointed end to seal. Stop the
spiral 1/4 inch from top of mold to allow bread to expand. Place
dough-wrapped mold on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining strips of
dough, placing 4 molds on each baking sheet. Cover with clean cloth
and let rise 30 minutes.

7. Heat oven to 350'F. In small bowl, beat egg with water to make egg
wash. Carefully brush sides and tops of dough cones with egg wash.
Bake 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from baking
sheet; cool on wire rack 5 minutes. With clean cloth to protect
hands, gently pull metal mold from bread cones. Cool cones completely
on wire rack.

NOTE: These unique bread cones are baked on the same metal forms,
called pointed cream roll cones, that are used to shape puff pastry
cream rolls. They may be purchased in cookware shops or by mail from
Maid of Scandinavia Co., 3244 Raleigh Ave., Minneapolis, Minn. 55416,
or by calling (800) 328-6722.
