Title: SPICED CRABAPPLES
Categories: Fruit, Oldies
Yield: 1 batch
1    Old-time recipe
Select even sized crabapples, do not remove stems, remove the blossom
end. Prick 5 or 6 times with a needle so the skin will not break.

Boil 2 cups of sugar with 1 cup of water and 1 cup of vinegar, 2
teaspoons whole cloves and 2 teaspoons allspice berries and a 3 inch
piece of whole cinnamon bark for five minutes.  Tie spices in cheese
cloth bag. Then put in crabapples so they are covered with the syrup.
Do not crowd, boil slowly until apples are soft or can be pierced
with a broom straw. Lift out of the syrup with skimmer and put into
jars stem end up. Pour boiling hot syrup over apples in jar fill
full, seal air tight. These are nice with roast duck, goose, or roast
pork.  Double recipe as many times as you wish. This is my
great-grandmother's and my grandmother's recipe more than 100 years
old.
