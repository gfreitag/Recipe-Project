1 1/2 tb -2 T truffle juice
1 tb Lemon juice
3 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
5    Scallions

2 tb Chopped black truffles
In a skillet, blanch scallions in salted water for 2 minutes. Drain
and set aside.

Roll out a piece of parchment paper long enough to hold five slices of
venison spread out next to each other. Place scallions along-side each
other in a line along the top quarter of the venison slices. Sprinkle
with chopped truffle, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Roll
slices very tightly, so the circumference of the roll is the size of
a quarter. Repeat process using the same piece of parchment paper.
Discard paper.

Place rolls in a baking dish and bake in a preheated 425F oven for 12
to 14 minutes. Remove pan from oven and cut rous into 1-inch pieces
