Title: SPAGHETTI-SQUASH FRITTERS - Country Living
Categories: Appetizers, Side dish, Vegetables, Country liv
Yield: 20 fritters
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
2    Large eggs, lightly beaten
2 1/2 lb Spaghetti squash
Vegetable oil for frying
1/2 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1/2 c  Chopped fresh dill
1. Several hours before serving, bake the squash: Heat oven to 350F.
Cut spaghetti squash in half lengthwise. With spoon, scoop out and
discard fibrous center and seeds. Place squash halves, cut sides
down, on baking sheet; bake 25 to 30 minutes or until squash is
tender-crisp (it should seem slightly undercooked.) Set aside to
cool. With fork, "comb" the squash flesh so it pulls off in strands.
Measure 4 C spaghetti squash and refrigerate until well chilled.
Discard squash skins.

2. Just before serving, in 1-quart saucepan, heat 1 1/2 inches oil
until deep-fat thermometer registers 350'F. In large bowl, combine
the chilled squash, flour, dill, salt, and pepper. Stir in eggs until
well combined.

3. In batches, drop heaping tablespoonfuls of squash mixture into hot
oil; fry 2 minutes, turning fritters once to brown evenly. (Be sure
to maintain oil temperature around 350'F to guarantee crispness.)
Drain fritters on paper towels and keep warm in low oven while frying
remaining squash mixture. Serve immediately.
