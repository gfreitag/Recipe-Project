1. Heat oven to 400'F. Lightly grease an 8-inch springform pan. In
large bowl, combine 2 3/4 C  flour, the sugar, baking soda, cream of
tartar, and salt. With pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in butter
until coarse crumbs form. Fold in currants.

2. Add buttermilk and mix just until dry ingredients are moist- ened
and a stiff dough forms. Stir in additional flour only if nec- essary
to make dough manageable, being careful to not overmix. Press dough
into greased pan; with knife, score top into 4 equal wedges. Brush
top with melted butter, if desired.

3. Bake 20 minutes; reduce oven temperature to 350'F and bake 30 to 35
minutes longer or until top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted
in the center comes out clean. Cool in pan 5 minutes; remove from pan
and cool completely on wire rack before slicing. Soda bread is best
the day it is baked.
