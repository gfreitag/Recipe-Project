Salt
2 ts Lemon juice
2 lg (1 1/2 lb) Maine russet
-potatoes, scrubbed
1. Fill large bowl with ice water; stir in lemon juice. Cut unpeeled
potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick strips and immediately drop them into ice
water to crisp and prevent browning.

2. In large, heavy, deep skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 360'F.
Drain potato strips; pat completely dry. In batches, fry potatoes
until crisp and golden-about 3 to 5 minutes-being careful to maintain
oil temperature at 360'F.

3. With slotted spoon or long-handled wire strainer, transfer
potatoes to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle with 1/4 to 1/2 t  salt,
if desired, and serve immediately.
