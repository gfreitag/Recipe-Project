place of the catsup and soy sauce if you prefer, or make a mixture of
all three ingredients to equal about 9 tablespoons. Cut pork into
narrow 1-inch strips, 1/4th inch thick; set aside. (partially freeze
pork first for easier cutting).  Cut green onions, bell pepper,
broccoli and onion into 1 inch pieces; set aside. Combine garlic,
ginger, pepper flakes, hot water, sugar, catchup and soy sauce; set
aside. In wok or large skillet, heat peanut or vegetable oil over
