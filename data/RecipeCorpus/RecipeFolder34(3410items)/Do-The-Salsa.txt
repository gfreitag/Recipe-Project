============
Salsa is more than a natcho chip dip. It's a flavor-packed condiment
or sauce that's easy to make.

Salsas offer a low-fat, high vitamin alternative to gravies and creamy
sauces on entrees.

SALSA BASICS

~ Salsa ia a Mexican word for sauce. Salasa verde refers to slasa
based on fresh tomatillos (Mexican green tomatoes) and jalepeno
peppers. Salsa ranchero is made withr oasted tomatoes and smoked
chilies. Salsa fresca is an uncooked fresh relish.

~ The North American definition of slasa has been stretched to
include any type of sauce, relish or chunky condiment that usually
includes either tomatoes and/or fruit chunks, combined with lime
juice, chilies and cilantro.

~ Commercial salsa is one of the fastest growing condiments.

THE SALSA STARS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While tomatoes are perfect, don't stop there. Make your next fresh
salsa with mango, peach, cantaloupe, papaya, kiwi, green apples,
pineapple, cucumber, avacado, sweet corn, sweet peppers or tomatillo.
Many of these ingredients combine well.

THE SEASONINGS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Red onions, scallions, lime or lemon juice, lime or lemon zest,
vinegar, cilantro, parsley, jalapeno peppers, any type of fresh or
dried chili pepper, cumin, oregano, fresh basil, black pepper, salt,
etc.

CREATIVE DESTINATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Mexican cuisine finds salsa on all kinds of dishes, be it eggs,
tacos, enchiladas, fajitas, burritoes and more.

~ Fresh fruit salsas are delicious on grilled entrees, such as mango
salsa on swordfish, green apple salsa on pork chops or pineapple
salsa on chicken.

~ Make a fast dip for chips or fresh vegetables by combining one part
salsa with one part yogurt or light sour cream.

~ Toss salsa with pasta (hot or cold), mix it into burger patties,
spoon it over grilled cheese sandwiches or on macaroni and cheese.


~ Make a Mexican bruschetta with a dollop of salsa spreadon a warm
tortilla wedge.

~ Chicken and fish can be braised or baked in salsa, white wine and a
little olive oil.

~ Salsa makes a great marinade (make sure it contains a liitle oil)
for grilled fish, chicken or pork.

REMEMBER
~~~~~~~~
~ Most salsas improve in flavor if left to sit at least 30 minutes in
the fridge before serving.

~ Fresh, homemade salsa doesn't last as long commercial brands. Keep
it no more than a few days.
