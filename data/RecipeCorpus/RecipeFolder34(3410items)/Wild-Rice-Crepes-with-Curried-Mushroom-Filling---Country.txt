little mushroom-stuffed bundles.

1. Prepare Wild-Rice Crepes: In medium-size bowl, combine flour and
salt. With wire whisk, beat in eggs and milk until almost smooth.
Stir in wild rice.

2. Heat heavy 9-inch skillet over medium heat; brush bottom with some
of the oil. Spoon about 1/3 C batter into skillet; tip pan to coat
bottom. Cook crepe 2 minutes or until top is set and bottom is
lightly browned. Carefully turn crepe and cook other side. Remove
finished crepe to sheet of waxed paper. Repeat to make 5 more crepes,
placing sheets of waxed paper between each. When crepes are al1 made,
cover stack tightly with plastic wrap; refrigerate up to 2 days or
seal in plastic bag and freeze up to 2 weeks, until ready to use.

3. A day before serving, prepare Mushroom Filling: In large skillet,
melt butter. Add mushrooms and shallots; saute until lightly browned.
Stir in wine and curry; cook until wine evaporates. Add cream cheese,
cream, and mustard; cook until cheese melts and mixture thickens.
Place in small bowl; cover and refrigerate until well chilled.

4. With 2-1/4-inch-round cutter, cut out 24 rounds from Crepes. Place
about 2 t filling onto top half of each crepe round. Fold crepe on
each side over filling so top of round is open and bottom is cone
shaped. Tie a chive around bottom half of crepe cone; trim chive
ends. Sprinkle open ends of cones with chopped parsley; place on tray
or serving platter. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
