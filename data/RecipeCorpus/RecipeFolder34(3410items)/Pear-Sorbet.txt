Title: Pear Sorbet
Categories: Ice cream, French, Fruit
Yield: 6 cups
Juice of 1 lemon
Grated rind of 1 lemon
1/4 c  Heavy cream
3 lb Fresh pears
1/2 c  Sugar
2 c  Water
1 c  White wine
While in Paris, I visited Ile St. Louis, where the famous
Berthillon's ice creams are made. I tasted wonderful flavors,
although most of them were no better than some of the ice creams I
make at home, using my ice cream machine.  The pear (poire) sorbet,
however, stood out. I had never tasted anything like it before, and
it was very good.

After returning home, I searched through my recipe files, and found
something that could serve as a basis for that ice cream.  After a few
experiments, I came out with this excellent sorbet.

Put the sugar, water, wine, lemon juice and lemon rind in a pan.
Peel, core and halve pears, and add to pan. Bring to boil. Reduce
heat to low, cover partially, and cook another 20-30 minutes. Strain
cooked pears, reserving liquid. Strain the liquid through a fine
sieve, and add 3/4 cup strained liquid to the pears. Puree in blender
or food processor until very smooth. Strain back the puree through a
fine sieve into a bowl, and refrigerate several hours. When cool, add
1/4 cup heavy cream. Mix to blend.

Pour into an ice-cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's
directions.
