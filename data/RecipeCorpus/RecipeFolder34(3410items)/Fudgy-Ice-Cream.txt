Title: Fudgy Ice Cream
Categories: Desserts, Ice cream
Yield: 6 servings
4 c  Milk
14 oz Can condensed milk
4 oz Instant pudding mix
"This ice cream comes as close as you can get to the taste of a
store-bought Fudgsicle, especially if you use Jell-O Chocolate Fudge
Instant Pudding Mix.  If your ice cream maker won't hold the whole
batch, divide it in half and freeze in two portions, or mold the
excess as frozen suckers."

Mix well all ingredients.  Stir freeze.
