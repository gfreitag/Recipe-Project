8 c  Water
1 c  Dry white wine
2    Carrots, peeled and halved
Trim the stem and cut 1/4 inch off the top of each artichoke. Rub the
cut surfaces with lemon halves to prevent discoloration.

ingredients, bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium and simmer
partially covered for 30 to 40 minutes, or until leaves peel away
easily. Remove artichokes from broth and serve alongside corned beef
