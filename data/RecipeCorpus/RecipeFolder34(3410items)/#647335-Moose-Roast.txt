Strained
1 lb Salt pork (optional)
4 lb Rump moose roast

Roll the salt pork out thin.  Wrap roast with the pork. Refrigerate
overnight or 10-12 hours*.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. (150
degrees C.).  Remove and discard the pork. Rub thoroughly with dry
mustard. Season with salt and pepper.  Place in a roasting pan.
Surround with vegetables. Pour tomatoes over vegetables. Cover and
bake for 2 hours for medium doneness.  For well done, bake an
additional 35 to 45 minutes. *This adjusts the meat if it has a wild
gamey taste. This is dictated by the animals feeding ground and not
age. Submitted By BARRY WEINSTEIN   On   08-21-95
