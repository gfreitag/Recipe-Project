Recipe by: Simply Seafood To make the filling: In a large saucepan
over med-high heat, saute the bacon until crisp. Stir in the flour,
followed by the spinahc and half and half. Cook, stirring well, until
very thick. Stir in the Tabasco and salt to taste. Take from the
heat, fold in the Parmesan cheese and let cool thoroughly.
To make the topping: Place the cream cheese in a glass bowl and
microwave for 30 seconds, or soften at room temperature.  Stir in the
garlic, green onion and sherry until cremy.  (Filling and topping can
be prepared up to 2 days in advance; store tightly covered in the
refrigerator.
Preheat oven ot 325Â°.  Pull the stems off the mushrooms, leaving a
cavity in the cap.  Discard the stems or save for another use.
Season the mushroom caps with salt and pepper.  Divide the spinach
filling evenly among the mushroom.  Lightly press one oyster into
each spinach-filled mushroom.
Top each oyster with about 1 teaspoon of cream cheese topping,
spreading out a bi to partially cover the oyster.  Place the
mushrooms on a baking pan, lightly oiled or sprayed with pan spray.
Sprinkle each mushroom with a little minced red bell pepper, if
using.  Bake in the oven until the mushrooms are tender, the spinach
filling is hot and the oysters are just cooked, 8-12 minutes.  Right
after taking the mushrooms from the ove, squeeze the lemon juice over.
