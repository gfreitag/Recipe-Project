Title: SESAME SEED BISCOTTI - House Beautiful
Categories: House beaut, Holiday, Cake/cookie
Yield: 4 dozen
2 lg Eggs
2 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 ts Grated lemon zest
1 c  Sesame seeds
3 tb Milk
3 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Baking powder
1/4 ts Salt
1 1/2    Sticks unsalted butter,
-slightly softened
3/4 c  Sugar
In a medium mixing bowl sift together flour, baking powder and salt;
set aside.

In a large mixing bowl beat butter and sugar until fluffy. Add eggs,
vanilla and lemon zest and beat until smooth. Gradually stir in dry
ingredients.

Divide dough in halF Place the halves on a sheet of waxed paper and
shape into 12-inch-long logs. Roll logs back and forth in the waxed
paper to smooth, and slide them onto a baking sheet. Press down on
logs to flatten to about 2 1/2 inches across. Chill 40 minutes, or
until firm enough to slice.

In a large skillet over medium heat, spread out sesame seeds and
toast 5 to 7 minutes, or until pale brown. Remove from heat and stir
or shake for 30 seconds. Pour into a shallow bowl and let cool
slightly. Stir in milk and let stand, stirring occasionally.

Using a sharp knife, trim off and discard uneven ends of logs. Mark
each log, crosswise, into about 22 even fingers. Cut along all
markings, and roll each finger in moist sesame seeds to coat evenly.
Stand fingers upright on greased baking sheers, spacing about 1 1/4
inches apart. Carefully press down and flatten fingers slightly to
prevent them from failing down on their sides during baking.

Bake in the center of a preheated 350'F oven 17 to 18 minutes, or
until golden on top and brown at the edges. Remove from oven and
transfer cookies to wire racks to cool completely. Store in airtight
container up to 1 week or freeze 1 month. Makes about 4 dozen 2
1/4-inch biscotti fingers.
