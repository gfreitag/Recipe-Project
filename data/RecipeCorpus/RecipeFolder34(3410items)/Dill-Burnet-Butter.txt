Title: Dill-Burnet Butter
Categories: Dips/spread, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 batch
-- or more to taste
2    Or 3 generous sprigs fresh
-- dill
1/2 lb Unsalted butter
1 ts Dijon mustard
2    Salad burnet sprigs
Blend all ingredients thoroughly until the mixture is pale green.

Alley writes: "This refreshing butter, with its hint of cucumber, is
great served on grilled fish or fresh French bread with a salad.
Choose young, tender leaves of burnet, as the older ones are often
tough."
