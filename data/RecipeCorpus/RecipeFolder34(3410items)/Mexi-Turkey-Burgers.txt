Categories: Poultry
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cumin
1/2 ts Chili powder
1/4 ts Oregano

Recipe by: jojo@leland.Stanford.EDU (Joanne Spetz) Mix the above
together (get your hands dirty!).  Add: 1 egg 1/4 cup plain yogurt
Shape into 4 patties, each 4 inches across.  Dredge in flour. Sauce
in 1 T oil until browned and cooked through.  The burgers can fall
apart easily, so grilling them is not advisable.  They are very moist
and juicy when done! I serve these on onion buns with yogurt as a
topping.
