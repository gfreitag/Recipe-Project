The tricky part of skewering seafood for the grill is that the
seafood and vegetables tend to spin around on the skewer. This can
make it hard to turn the food and ensure even cooking. Here are a few
suggestions:

* Dense, meaty seafood - such as shrimp or tuna - holds up better on a
single skewer than more tender kinds - like halibut or scallops.

* Rather than threading the items in the center on one skewer, use two
skewers side-by-side to hold the food neatly in place.

* Metal skewers often have a flattened shape that holds the food a
little more securely, but as it cooks it may still loosen and spin.

* Some less expensive aluminum skewers have a "V" shape to them, which
works well to keep the food from turning on the skewer.
