Assorted fruits
In a blender, process the melon flesh to a smooth puree.

Put the gelatine and 1/2 cup Muskat wine in a small pan, and bring to
a boil, mixing well to ensure that the gelatine is completely
dissolved. Add the gelatine mixture to the pureed melon, and mix
well. Put over a bowl full of ice cubes and cool, mixing
occasionally, until the mixture starts to thicken.

Meanwhile, whip the egg whites, adding the sugar gradually, until
thick and shiny peaks form. Add about one third of it to the melon
mixture, and mix well. Add the rest of it, but this time fold it
carefully to blend.

Whip the heavy cream until thick, and gently fold it into the mixture
too. Transfer the mousse to a bowl, flatten with a spatula, and
refrigerate several hours, or overnight.

To make the sauce, put the sugar and water in a medium pan, bring to
a boil and cook on low heat until it thickens and turns golden brown.
Add 2 cups Muskat wine, cinnamon stick, vanilla pod, and a strip of
orange peel. Bring to a boil, remove from the heat and cool to room
temperature. Drain, and refrigerate several hours or overnight.

To serve, form small balls of mousse using two wet cups, and pour some
sauce over it. Garnish with fresh fruit slices.
