Title: White Bean Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
10 c  Chicken broth
1 ts Dried thyme
4    Allspice berries
2    Bay leaves
2    Carrots -- diced
3    Plum tomatoes -- diced
1/2 c  Sour cream -- for garnish
1 lb Dried cannellini beans
8 c  Cold water
2    Fennel bulbs -- rinsed
2 tb Olive oil
4 md Onions -- diced
4    Cloves garlic -- coarsely
Chopped
1    Smoked ham hocks
Rinse the beans and soak overnight in the cold water.  Drain, rinse
and set aside.  Remove the ferns from the fennel bulbs.  Coarsely
chop them and set aside.  Trim the bulbs and cut into 1/2" cubes.
Place the oil in a heavy soup pot.  Add the fennel bulbs, onions and
garlic; wilt the vegetables over low heat, stirring occasionally, for
15 minutes. Add the beans, ham hock, broth, thyme, allspice and bay
leaves. Bring the soup to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer,
partially covered, until the beans are tender; about 1 1/2 hours.
Remove the ham hock, allspice, and bay leaves. Let the ham hock stand
until cool enough to handle, then shed the meat from the bone.  Puree
2 cups of the soup in a food processor or blender until smooth.  Stir
the puree back into the soup along with the fennel ferns and meat
from the ham hock.  Reheat over low heat. Meanwhile, cook the diced
carrots in boiling water to cover until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
Drain and stir into the soup.  Serve the soup in large shallow bowls,
garnished with diced tomatoes and a dollop of sour cream.
