Categories: Country liv, Desserts, Puddings
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 c  Firmly packed light-brown
-sugar
2 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 ts Salt
2/3 c  Granulated sugar
1 cn (12-oz) evaporated milk
2    3-inch cinnamon sticks
1 c  Canned pumpkin
3    Large eggs
1. Heat oven to 350'F. Lightly oil a fluted 8- by 2-inch metal mold
or flan dish. In heavy, large skillet, melt granulated sugar over low
heat without stirring until golden brown. Do not stir sugar as it
melts; in- stead swirl the skillet from time to time to facilitate
even melting. Pour melted sugar, or caramel, into oiled mold, tilting
quickly to coat bottom; set aside.

2. In same skillet, heat undiluted milk and cinnamon sticks over
medium-low heat until bubbles appear around side of skillet, stirring
occasionally. Remove from heat and discard cinnamon sticks.

3. In medium-size bowl, with wire whisk, combine pumpkin, eggs, brown
sugar, vanilla, and salt until smooth. Beat in heated milk until well
mixed. Pour into mold. Place mold in a 13- by 9-inch baking pan and
add enough hot water to come halfway up the mold.

4. Bake flan 65 to 75 minutes or until a knife inserted into center
comes out clean. Remove from hot water and cool on wire rack to room
temperature. Refrigerate flan until ready to serve-at least 3 hours.

5. To serve, loosen flan around the edge with a small spatula and
place inverted rimmed plate on top. Holding plate and flan mold,
invert to unmold flan.
