Categories: House beaut, Pasta/rice, Main dish, Appetizers
Yield: 2 servings
-matchsticks
1 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
1 c  Freshly grated pecorino
-cheese
Freshly ground black pepper
-to taste
Sea salt
8 oz Dried Italian bucatini
2 oz Pancetta (or very lean top
-quality bacon blanched
-for 1 minute in boiling
-water & drained
-thoroughly), cut into
In a large pot, bring 3 quarts of water to a rolling boil. Add 1 1/2
T salt and the bucatini, stirring to prevent the pasta from sticking.
Cook until al dente. Drain the pasta, leaving a few drops of water
clinging to the bucatin1 so that the sauce will adhere.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet, combine the pancetta or bacon and oil
over moderate heat. Saute  until the pancctta or bacon is a rosy
color but not crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the drained pasta to the
skillet and, using two forks, toss quickly and thoroughly with the
pancetta. Add the cheese, sprinkle generously with black pepper, and
toss again. Cover and let rest over low heat for 1 minute to allow
the pasta to absorb the sauce. Serve immediately. Serves 2 as a main
course, 4 as a first course.
