Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black Pepper -- freshly
-ground
1/4 ts Tabasco Sauce
1 lb Dry Split Peas
6 oz Chicken Skin -- cut into 1"
-pieces
2    To 3 Garlic Cloves, Peeled,
-Crushed -- coarsely chopped
8 c  Water
2 ts Herbes De Provence
1. Place the chicken skin pieces in a skillet and saute over high
heat for 8 to 10 mins, until the fat is rendered and the skin is
crisp. Remove the cracklings and fat and discard all but 3 Tbs of the
fat.

2. Place the reserved fat and cracklings in a large saucepan, add the
onion, and saute for 5 mins. Then, add the garlic, mix well, and stir
in the water, herbes de Provence, salt, pepper, Tabasco and split
peas.

3. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat and boil gently for 1 hour.
Stir the soup well although it should be fairly thick, if you would
prefer it thinned a little, add some water.

4. To serve, divide the soup among six bowls, and offer extra Tabasco
sauce, if desired. Makes 6 servings. Note: If you want to reduce your
caloric intake even more, eliminate the cracklings and use chicken
fat or 3 Tbs of peanut oil to start the soup.
