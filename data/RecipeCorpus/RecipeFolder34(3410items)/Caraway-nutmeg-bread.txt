Title: Caraway-nutmeg bread
Categories: Breads, Israeli
Yield: 4 loaves
1 1/2 c  Milk, lukewarm
1 tb Salt
Melted butter for brushing
1 tb Flour for sprinkling
1 kg Flour ;2 lb + 3 oz
50 g  Granulated yeast
2 ts Caraway seeds
1 ts Ground nutmeg
1    Egg
Note: I make this bread using granulated yeast.  If using other types
of yeast, proof it in part of the milk and proceed as described. Use 2
packages of dried yeast for the given amount of flour.

In a large bowl, mix the milk, egg, caraway, nutmeg and yeast.
Gradually add the flour, by 1/2 cup measurements, beating well after
each addition. Toward the end you'll get a soft dough that should be
kneaded on the countertop.  Knead 10 minutes.

Let rise 1 1/2 hours.  Punch down, add the salt, and knead 5 minutes.
Let rise again, about 1 hour.  Punch down, form into 4 or 5 small
loaves, and let the loaves rise, covered for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 360 F (180 C).

Brush the loaves with melted butter, sprinkle with flour, and bake 30
to 40 minutes.

the directions significantly).
