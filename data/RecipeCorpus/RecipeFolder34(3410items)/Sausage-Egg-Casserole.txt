Title: Sausage Egg Casserole
Categories: Casseroles
Yield: 3 servings
2 c  Milk
1 ts Dry mustard
1 ts Salt
Dash of pepper
4 sl White bread
1 lb Bulk sausage
1 c  Grated sharp Cheddar cheese
6    Eggs
Tear up bread and place in a greased 9 x 13 inch baking dish.  Brown
and drain sausage.  Drain off fat.  Spoon sausage over bread.
Sprinkle with grated cheese.  Beat together eggs, milk, dry mustard,
salt and pepper. Pour over bread, sausage and cheese.  Bake in a
preheated oven at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes.  The cheese will
rise to the top during baking.  For a better taste I make this the
night before. Cover and refrigerate. Randy Rigg
