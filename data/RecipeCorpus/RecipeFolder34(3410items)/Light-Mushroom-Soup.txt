Yield: 4 servings
1 c  Heavy cream
1/2 ts Ground cumin
Dill seed
1 tb Dried boletus mushrooms,
-crumbled (Optional)
2 ts Coasrse (kosher) salt
2 ts Fresh lemon juice
Hot pepper sauce
1 1/2 tb Unsalted butter
1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms, quartered
1    Scallion, equal parts green

1 tb Cornstarch
2 c  Chicken broth
Melt the butter in a nuncovered 2 1/2-quart microwavable souffle pan
on High (100% power) for 1 1/4 minutes.  Meanwhile, finely chop the
mushrooms in a food processor.  Add the mushrooms to the melted
butter, along with the scallion and celery leaves.  Stir to coat,
then cook, uncovered, on High for 3 minutes or until the mushrooms
look limp.

Dissolve the cornstarch in the chicken broth.  Add the broth mixture,
along with the cream, cumin, a pinch of dill seed, and the dried
boletus (if using) to the mushrooms.  Cover tightly with polyvinyl
plastic wrap and microcook on High for 6 minutes.  Carefully pierce
the plastic wrap to release the steam.  Remove the plastic wrap.
Season the soup with salt, lemon juice and about 4 drops of hot
sauce.  Serve hot.

Low-Wattage Variation:  Melt the butter for 2 1/4 minutes.  Cook the
mushroom mixture for 5 minutes.  Add the liquid ingredients and cook
for 10 minutes.  Finish as above.

Makes 4 cups.
