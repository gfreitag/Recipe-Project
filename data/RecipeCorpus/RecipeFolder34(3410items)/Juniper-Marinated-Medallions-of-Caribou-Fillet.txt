Categories: Game, Meats
Yield: 4 servings
1    Sprig rosemary
Salt
Fresh ground black pepper
Flour for coating
Butter for frying
4 tb Cream
1 tb Black currant jam
10    Juniper berries
2 tb Oil
2 lb Fillet of caribou
1    Onion; chopped
1    Carrot; diced
2 c  Red wine
2    Cloves
1    Bay leaf
Fry the crushed juniper berries in the oil until they change colour
slightly. Cool. Marinate the caribou fillet in this oil and juniper
mixture overnight, in a cool place. Cut the caribou fillet into
steaks, or medallions, about 3/4 inch thick. Trim the edges then set
the medallions aside.

Fry the trimmings in a little oil until brown and crispy. Add the
chopped onion and carrot and fry gently until onion is golden brown.
Pour in the red wine, add the cloves and herbs and reduce gently til
half volume. Strain and set sauce aside.

Season the medallions with pepper, toss in flour and then fry in
butter until well browned but pink inside. Salt them and put on one
side to keep warm.

Pour some of the sauce into the frying pan and scrape to mix in the
meat juices. Add the cream, and stir to incorporate it into the
sauce; do not allow to boil. Finally, add the black currant jam.

Pour the sauce over and serve.
