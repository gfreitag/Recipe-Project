For the broth, place the chicken pieces and remaining broth
ingredients except the salt in a large heavy pot.  Add just enough
water to cover. Bring to a low boil, reduce the heat to medium-low,
and simmer, partially covered, skimming any foam, for 30 minutes.
Salt the broth to taste and continue to cook uncovered until the
chicken is cooked through, 20 minutes longer.  Remove the chicken
from the broth and let stand until cool enough to handle.  Discard
the skin and shred the meat from the bones.  Place the chicken in a
bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.  Strain the broth
and measure 6 cups for the chowder.  Refrigerate or freeze the
remaining broth for another use.  For the chowder, cook the bacon
over low heat about 5 minutes.  Add the onion and cook, stirring,
until wilted, about 10 minutes.  Do not brown.  Sprinkle in the flour
and cook, stirring constantly, another 5 minutes.  Add the reserved
broth and stir until blended with the flour.  Add the potatoes and
thyme.  Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium low heat until the
potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes.  Off the heat, stir in
the half-and-half, corn and shredded chicken.  Cook, stirring, over
low heat for 5 minutes.  Season generously with salt and pepper.
Before serving, reheat the soup over low heat.  Stir in the tomatoes,
avocado, lime juice, and parsley and serve immediately.
