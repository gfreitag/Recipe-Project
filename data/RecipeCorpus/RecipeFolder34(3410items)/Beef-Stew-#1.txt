Recipe by: gmccague@sol.UVic.CA (Gordon McCague)

Brown the beef with the onions in a large pot.  Once the meat is
brown add 3 cups of water and bay leaves.  Heat over medium heat
while you peel the potatoes and carrrots. Add potatoes and carrots to
the stew pot.  Cover with water.  Bring to a boil. Cook until
potatoes are tender. Mix up a flour and water mixture to thicken the
stew.  Add it right to the pot.  No need to remove the meat/veggies.
Stir well to make sure you don't get lumps. Add pepper/salt/whatever
you like for spices.  I sometimes add garlic when rowning the meat.
Oregano is a nice touch as well. Once the stew is thickened you can
serve it.  Sometimes I make dumplings with the stew.  I usually buy a
box of Bisquick as it has a recipe on it. Unfortunately I cannot
relay the recipe to you as I don't have any in the house at the
moment.  You would have to talk to my grandmother if you wanted to
make them from scratch.  Isn't that the way it always is.
