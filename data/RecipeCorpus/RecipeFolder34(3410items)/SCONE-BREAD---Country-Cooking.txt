Categories: Country coo, Breads
Yield: 1 loaf
1/4 c  (1/2 stick) butter
Optional ingredients (see
-Note)
1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
3 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
1 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
1. Heat oven to 375'F. Grease baking sheet. In large bowl, combine
flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. With pastry
blender or 2 knives, cut the butter in until mixture resembles coarse
crumbs. If desired, stir in optional ingredient.

2. Add buttermilk to dry ingredients and mix lightly with fork until
mixture clings together and forms a soft dough. Turn dough out onto
lightly floured surface and knead 8 or 10 times until dough is smooth.

3. Shape dough into ball. Place on greased baking sheet. Pat out to
make a 7-inch round. With sharp knife, make 1/2-inch-deep cuts,
scoring dough into quarters.

4. Bake dough 45 to 50 minutes or until loaf is well browned and
sounds hollow when tapped on top. Remove to wire rack and cool
completely before slicing. For easier slicing, wrap in a damp cloth
and refrigerate.

Note: For variety, add 1/2 C dark seedless raisins or shredded Cheddar
cbeese, or add 1 to 2 t caraway or poppy seeds to dough and sprinkle
some additional seeds on top.
