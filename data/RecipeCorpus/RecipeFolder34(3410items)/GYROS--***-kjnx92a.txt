Title: GYROS  *** kjnx92a
Categories: Meats, Greek, Main dish, Bbq/grill
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 ts Parsley
1 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper ; freshly ground
8 lg Pita
2 lb Beef or lamb; ground
4    Green onion; finely chopped
1 c  Garlic; minced
1 ts Oregano
1/4 ts Cumin
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
2    Scallions, including green
-tops, finely chopped
1 c  Yogurt
2 tb Mayonnaise
Juice of one lemon
Mix all ingredients except pita, mixing well and
kneading until mixture is stiff.  On skewer pack  meat mixture about
5" long and not more than 2" in diam.  Put as many "fingers" as
possible on a skewer leaving a 1" space in between.  Cook over hot
coals for 10 to 15 mintues,  turning frequently.. Take pita and slide
gyro onto center. Drizzle with sauce.  Fold over to eat

SAUCE:   Mix together ingredients until well blended.

I have another recipe that gives the following  for the meat
mixture:

lean ground lamb,
2 lb
2 slices homemade bread toasted and crumbled
1 tsp.   crushed allspice,
1 tsp.   crushed coriander seed
1 clove  pressed garlic
grated onion
1
1 tsp.   chopped fresh savory
salt and freshly ground pepper.
:

This latter recipe also suggests wrapping the "fingers" on the skewer
with sliced bacon.  If anyone tries this, let me know how it works
out.  I have this frequently in Greece and here in the U.S.,  but as
I have said, I view it as a "deli"  item.   Krinos Foods has a "gyros
kit" that is sold in the frozen food section of some supermarkets.
