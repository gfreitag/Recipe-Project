Title: Nutty Bran Crackers
Categories: Breads, Low cal/fat
Yield: 15 dozen
1/4 c  Vegetable oil
2 tb Ground walnuts
1/2 ts Salt
x  Vegetable cooking spray
1 c  Unprocessed wheat bran
1 tb Brown sugar
1 pk Dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water (105 to 115 deg)
4 c  All-purpose flour; divided
Place bran in a baking pan; spreading evenly.  Bake at 350 degrees F.
for 10 minutes, sitrring after 5 minutes.  Set aside.

Dissolve brown sugar and yeast in warm water in a large bowl; let
stand 5 minutes.  Add bran, 2 cups flour, oil, walnuts, and salt;
stir well. Stir in 1-1/2 cups flour to form a stiff dough.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead until smooth and
elastic (about 10 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1
tablespoon at a time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands.

Place the dough in a bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat
top. Cover; let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts,
until doubled in bulk.

Punch dough down, and divide into 10 equal portions, shaping each
into a ball (cover the remaining dough while working to prevent it
from drying out).

Roll 1 ball into a 10-1/2- x 9-inch paper-thin rectangle on a baking
sheet coated with cooking spray.  Score the dough by making 5
lengthwise cuts and 2 crosswise cuts to form 18 crackers.  Prick
entire surface liberally with a fork (do not allow to rise).

Bake at 350 degrees F. for 15 minutes or until browned and crisp.
Remove from pan; let cool completely on a wire rack.  Separate into
individual crackers.  Repeat procedure with remaining dough. Store in
an airtight container.  Yield:  15 dozen (serving size: 1 cracker).
