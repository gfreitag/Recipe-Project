Categories: Meats, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
-ground
1/2 c  Olive Oil, Extra-Virgin
1/4 c  Basil -- julienned
12    Rib Lamb Chops, 1 1/2" Thick
-trim of excess fat
3 tb Dijon Mustard
2 ts Garlic -- minced
2 tb Balsamic Vinegar
1/2 ts Kosher Salt
1/8 ts Black Pepper -- freshly
* Ask the butcher to leave the bones 3 to 4 inches long.

1. In a nonreactive bowl, combine the Dijon mustard, garlic, vinegar,
salt, and pepper with 2 tsp water. Slowly whisk in the olive oil to
form a creamy marinade. Stir in the cut basil.

2. Add the chops to the marinade and toss to coat evenly. Marinate the
chops for 1 to 3 hours, covered and refrigerated.

3. Preheat a grill, grill pan, or barbecue to very hot. Shake the
excess marinade from the chops and grill 4 to 5 mins a side for
medium-rare, or slightly longer for more well done. Transfer to a
warm platter and serve.

NOTE: This a "finger food", meant to be eaten hot-off-the-grill.
