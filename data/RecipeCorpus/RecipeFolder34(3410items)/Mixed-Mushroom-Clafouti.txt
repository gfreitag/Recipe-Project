Title: Mixed Mushroom Clafouti
Categories: Newspaper, Pie/tart, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
3    Egg whites
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Black pepper
3/4 c  Flour; all-purpose
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese; grated
2 tb Corn-oil margarine
2 md Onion; finely chopped
1 1/2 lb Mushrooms; thinly sliced
1/4 c  Sherry
1 1/3 c  Milk; nonfat
1    Egg
Preheat the oven to 350Ã¸F.  Melt the margarine in a large saucepan or
Dutch oven.  Add the onion and cook over medium-low heat until the
onion is translucent.  Add the mushrooms and cook, covered, stirring
occasionally, until soft.  Add the sherry and cook, uncovered, over
medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until most of the liquid has
been absorbed, about 15 minutes.

While the mushrooms are cooking, coat a 10-inch pie plate or quiche
dish with vegetable oil spray; set aside.  Combine the milk, egg, egg
whites, salt, pepper and flour in a blender and blend at high speed 1
minute.

Pour a thin layer of egg batter into the prepared dish and place it
in the center of the oven for 8 minutes.  Remove the dish from the
oven and place it on a baking sheet to catch any spillage.

Spoon the mushroom mixture evenly over the "crust" and sprinkle with
cheese evenly over the mushroom mixture.  Pour the remaining batter
evenly over the top.  Carefully place the baking sheet back in the
oven and bake about 1 hour, or until the clafouti is puffed up and
browned. Remove from the oven and allow to cool at least 15 minutes
before slicing. As it cools, the clafouti will lose some of its
puffiness and flatten out.
