In a small bowl, mix yeast and warm water; set aside. In a saucepan,
heat milk, butter, potato flakes, sugar and salt to 110/115 deg.
Cool. Stir in yeast and egg. Gradually add enough flour to form a
stiff dough. Turn out onto a floured surface. Knead until smooth and
elastic, about 6-8 minutes, adding additional flour if necessary.
Place dough in greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and
let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Meanwhile,
place all filling ingredients in the top of a double boiler; cook and
stir until thickened. Cool. Punch dough down; divide in half. On a
floured surface, roll each half into a l6-in. x 12-in. rectangle.
Spread half the cream mixture on the dough. Roll up jelly-roll style,
starting at the narrow end. Seal edges. Place on a greased cookie
sheet, seam side down. Shape into a ring and cut 1-in. slices almost
through the roll. Lay slices flat. Melt remaining butter and brush
ring. Sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds. Repeat with remaining
dough and filling. Cover rings and let rise in a warm place until
doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 deg. for 20-25 minutes or until
lightly browned. Cool on wire rack. (Rings freeze well.) Yield: 2
