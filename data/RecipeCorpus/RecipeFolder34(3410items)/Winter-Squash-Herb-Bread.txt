-OR-
1/2 tb -Dried dill weed
4    Garlic cloves; crushed
1 ts Salt
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Butter or margarine
2 tb Sugar
1 tb Baking yeast
1/4 c  -Warm water
3 c  Unbleached flour
2    Eggs; lightly beaten
1 c  Finely chopped fresh sage
Combine the milk, butter, and sugar in a small saucepan and heat,
stirring, until the butter is melted.  Remove from heat and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Add 2
cups of flour and the eggs, squash, sage, dill, garlic, and salt.
Mix slightly to combine ingredients.  When the milk mixture has
cooled to lukewarm, stir it in with the rest of the ingredients to
form a sticky ball.

Add the remaining flour 1/3 cup at a time, mixing to moisten each
addition, until the dough becomes smooth.  It will be wet and
slightly sticky. Cover your hands with a little flour, turn the dough
out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead briefly.

Form the dough into a ball and place in a lightly greased loaf pan.
It can also be divided into small balls to make dinner rolls (place
on a lightly greased cookie sheet or in a muffin tin).  Cover with
plastic wrap and let rise until the dough has more than doubled,
about 1 to 1-1/2 hours. While the dough is rising, preheat oven to
275 degrees F.

Place the risen dough in the oven and bake until the top is golden
brown and the sides are slightly brown, an hour or 70 minutes.  Check
the sides by pulling the bread out of the pan.  When done, cool bread
on a wire rack, then serve or wrap and refrigerate.
