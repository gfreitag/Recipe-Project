Title: *Savory Oven Pot Roast
Categories: Meats, Microwave
Yield: 8 servings
2 tb Tomato paste
1 tb Vinegar
1 tb Sugar
2 ts Celery salt
1 tb Chopped parsley
1 ea Bay leaf
3 lb Boneless roast
1 x  Flour mix*
1 tb Oil
4 ea Onions sliced
1 ea Garlic clove, crushed
2 c  Hot beef bouillon
*Blend flour with salt, pepper and nutmeg. (to taste) Dust roast with
flour mixture, brown in oil.  Put in roasting pan. Brown onions and
garlic in same pan, add to meat.  Add remaining ingredients, cover,
and bake at 350 degrees F, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

This does well in the Microwave pressure cooker which I usually use
as it is still too hot here in September to oven cook much.
