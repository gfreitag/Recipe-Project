crusts on stone and bake for 6 to 8 minutes. Remove crusts from oven

Prepare sauce: In a pan over medium heat, cook tomatoes until they are
reduced by half, about 30 to 45 minutes. Cool sauce slightly, purse

olive oil and onions together until onions are limp. Season with salt
and pepper and set aside.

Brush prebaked crust with remaining olive oil, top with tomato sauce,
cooked onion mixture, Gorgonzola, and bacon. Sprinkle each surface
with mint and pine nuts.
