straight down. Place on an extra large ungreased baking sheet. Reroll
dough as necessary.

Bake at 450F 8-10 minutes or till biscuits are lightly browned.

Meanwhile, cook sausage, green onion and garlic in a medium skillet
till no pink remains, stirring well to break up any large chunks.

tomato paste and water. Heat through. Cut each slice cheese into
quarters, halve each to make 48 triangles.

Spoon a scant 1 teaspoon of the sausage mixture on each biscuit. Top
with a cheese triangle. Return to oven for 1-2 minutes to melt
cheese. Serve hot. Makes 48

To make ahead: Place biscuits topped with sausage mixture on a baking
sheet; freeze about 30 minutes. Remove from pan and store in freezer
bags. To serve, place biscuits, sausage side up, on a baking sheet
and cover loosely with foil. Heat in a 350 degree oven 10-12 minutes
or till biscuits are heated through. Add cheese and bake until
