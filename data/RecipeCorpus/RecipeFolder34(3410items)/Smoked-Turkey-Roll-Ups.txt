Divide 1 package of cheese equally and spread over each tortilla.
Divide turkey slices equally and layer over cheese, overlapping
turkey slices slightly to cover tortilla.  Divide remaining package
of cheese equally and spread over the turkey slices.  At one edge of
each tortilla, place 2 quarters of green onion, roll up tortilla
rolls, seam side down, in self closing bag; refrigerate several
hours, overnight is best. To serve, cut each roll crosswise into 1/2
inch slices to form pinwheels. If desired, arrange pinwheels on
serving plate and garnish with cherry peppers in the center.  To keep
flour tortillas soft while preparing the turkey rolls, cover with a
slightly damp cloth. You can substiture a kosher dill pickle for the
green onion. Randy Rigg Submitted By RANDY RIGG   On   08-18-95
