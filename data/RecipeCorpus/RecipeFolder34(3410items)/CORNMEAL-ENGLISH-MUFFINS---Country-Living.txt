Title: CORNMEAL ENGLISH MUFFINS - Country Living
Categories: Country liv, Muffins, Breads
Yield: 20 muffins
3 1/2    To 4 C unsifted bread flour
2 ts Salt
1    Large egg
1 c  Yellow cornmeal
1 1/4 c  Milk
2 tb Butter
1/3 c  Warm water (105' to 115'F)
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/4 ts Sugar
1. In small saucepan, heat milk until bubbles appear around side of
pan-remove from heat and add butter. Set aside to allow butter to
melt and mixture to cool to warm (about 105' to 115'F).

2. In small bowl, combine water, yeast, and sugar; stir to dissolve
yeast. Let stand until foamy-about 5 minutes.

3. In large bowl, preferably of heavy-duty electric mixer, combine 2 C
flour and the salt; make a well in center of flour mixture. Add the
milk mixture, yeast mixture, and the egg. With wooden spoon or dough
hook of mixer, beat until smooth batter forms. Add 1 1/2C  flour and
the cornmeal to batter and beat until soft dough forms. Continue
beating until dough pulls away from side of bowl.

4. Turn dough out onto floured surface. Knead dough, adding as much of
remaining 1/2 C flour as necessary to prevent stickiness, until
smooth and elastic-about 6 minutes.

5. Wash, dry, and oil mixing bowl; place dough in oiled bowl, turning
to bring oiled side up. Cover with clean cloth and let dough rise in
warm place, away from drafts, until double in size-about 1 hour.

6. On floured surface, roll dough out to a rectangle about 1/4 inch
thick. With 3-inch-round cookie cutter, cut out dough to make
muffins. Reroll trimmings and cut out more muffins. Cover muffins
with clean cloth and let rest 20 minutes.

7. Lightly oil a heavy skillet and heat over medium heat. In batches,
place muffins in skillet and cook about 3 minutes or until bottoms
are browned and muffins puff up; turn over and cook other side 2 to 3
minutes or until muffins are cooked through and browned on other
side. Serve warm.
