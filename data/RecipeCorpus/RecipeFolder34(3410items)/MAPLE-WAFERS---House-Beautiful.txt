Title: MAPLE WAFERS - House Beautiful
Categories: House beaut, Holiday, Cake/cookie
Yield: 3 dozen
1/4 ts Baking soda
Pinch salt
1 lg Egg
1 1/4 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 c  Pure maple syrup
1    Stick plus 2 T unsalted
-butter
1 c  All-purpose flour
2 1/2 tb Sugar
In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring syrup to boil. Boil
3 1/2 minutes, or until syrup is reduced to about 1/2 cup. Add butter
and let mixture return to boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and
let cool.

In a medium bowl sift together flour, sugar, baking soda and salt; set
aside.

In another bowl beat together egg and vanilla; stir in maple mixture.
Add dry ingredients and stir until well blended (mixture will be
fluid). Drop batter by small rounded teaspoonfuls onto greased baking
sheets; space about 3 1/2 inches apart, or wafers may run together.

Bake in preheated 375'F oven 5 to 6 minutes, or until wafers are gold-
rimmed with 1/2 inch of light brown. Watch carefully to avoid burning.
Remove from oven and let stand 1 minute. Then, using a spatula,
quickly transfer wafers to wire racks before they become brittle. (If
they firm up before they can be removed, return them to the oven for
1 to 2 minutes to soften slightly.) Allow wafers to cool completely.
(Cool baking sheets completely before reusing; grease thoroughly
between batches.) Store in an airtight container up to 1 week or 1
month in the freezer. Makes about 3 dozen 3 1/2-inch cookies.
