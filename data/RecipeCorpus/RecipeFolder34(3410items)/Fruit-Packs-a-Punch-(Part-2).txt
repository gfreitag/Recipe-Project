10 EASY WAYS TO ADD FRUIT TO YOUR LIFE

Add fruit to leafy green salads.  For example:  sliced grapefruit,
kiwi, oranges, strawberries, pears, apples, peaches, avocado; diced
melon, mango; halved grapes; or pineapple chunks.  (See recipes,
Parts 3 and 4.)

Serve fresh or dried fruit for dessert instead of sweets or bakery
products.

In a blender or food processor, puree ripe fruits (peaches,
strawberries, mango, raspberries) and serve as a sauce over other
fruits, puddings, shortbreads or cakes.

Add chopped fruits (apricots, apples, grapes, dates, mangoes or
peaches, for example) to tuna and chicken salads.

Stir fruits (diced apples, pears, oranges, fresh or dried apricots,
raisins, prunes) into cooked rice and poultry stuffings.

Add grated apple or chopped dates to a peanut butter sandwich instead
of jelly or jam.

Stir fruit (berries, peaches, cantaloupe, mango) into low-fat yogurt
for a breakfast treat or dessert.  Or combine in a blender with ice
for a fruit smoothie.

Top pancakes or waffles with fruit (blueberries, sliced bananas,
strawberries), or add fruit to the batter.

Serve fruit slices (apples and pears) with yogurt or cheese-flavored
dips.

Cook rice or bulgur wheat in orange juice instead of water.

ABOUT FRUIT JUICES:  Normally, juices pack less nutrient power than
whole fruits.  And virtually all of a fruit's fiber is lost if you
use a juice extractor.  Better choice:  a powerful blender that
crushes and liquefies the entire fruit, including skin, seeds and
membranes. This way, juice offers more nutrition than does eating the
whole fruit.

Buy juices that are labeled "100 percent juice."

NOTE:  Fruit juice is more apt to quickly raise blood glucose and
insulin levels than is whole fruit.
