Recipe by: leroux@cs.ubc.ca (Stephen Leroux)

In your favourite soup cooking dish (preferably something with a nice
thick base), melt butter/heat oil or medium-high heat.  Add onion,
garlic, and cilantro and fry until soft.  Add tomatos.  Turn heat
down to just below medium.  Fry some more, for a minute or so, then
add 1.5 cups of water. Take 2 of the perogys and chop 'em up into
little bits.  Add all of the perogys to the soup, and a small dash of
tobasco.  Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Enjoy.
