1. In ovenproof 5-quart Dutch oven or casserole, heat 1 T oil over
medium-high heat; brown beef on all sides, in batches. With slotted
spoon, remove beef and set aside.

2. Add remaining 2 T oil to pan. Reduce heat to medium and add onions
and garlic; saute 5 minutes. Stir in carrots, tomatoes, sage, herbes
de Provence, cloves, orange peel, bay leaf, salt, and pepper.

3. Pour red wine over all; add browned beef and enough water to cover
and stir to blend. Heat mixture to a gentle simmer. Meanwhile, heat
oven to 250'F. When mixture begins to simmer, remove from heat,
cover, and bake 4 flours, stirring occasionally. (If a thicker stew
is desired, uncover and bake 30 minutes longer to evaporate some
liquid.) Serve, or cool, cover, and refrigerate. Provencale Beef Stew
will taste even better the next day.
