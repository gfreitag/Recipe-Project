Or
1/4 ts Ground ginger
2 1/2 ts Cornstarch
1/2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 c  Orange juice
1/4 c  Salad oil

With vegetable peeler, cut peel from orange into 1 1/2 inch-wide
pieces, being careful not to cut into white membrane. Cut pieces into
1 1/2 inch-long strips. On small cookie sheet, let peels dry slightly
in 200^F. oven 30 minutes.

Cut chicken into 1 1/2-inch pieces.  In medium bowl, mix well
chicken, soy sauce, sherry, green onions, red pepper and ginger. In
small bowl, mix well cornstarch, sugar, salt and orange juice. Cover
and refrigerate both.

About 15 minutes before serving:  In 10-inch skillet over medium
heat, in hot oil, with slotted spoon, stir-fry peels until crisp and
edges are slightly browned, about 2 minutes; drain on paper towels.

In remaining oil in skillet, over high heat, stir-fry chicken mixture
until chicken loses pink color and is tender, about 4 minutes. Stir
orange-juice mixture, then add to chicken and stir-fry until mixture
is slightly thickened and coats chicken.

Spoon onto warm platter; sprinkle with peels.  Makes 4 servings.
