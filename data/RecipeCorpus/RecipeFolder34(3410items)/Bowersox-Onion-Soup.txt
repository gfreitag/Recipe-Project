Do this VERY SLOWLY, over medium heat until deep, dark brown, with a
thickened, almost caramelized texture without being burned. This

high-sided, broiler-safe bowls. Ladle the soup over the bread until
it is covered and the soup is near the top of the ramkins or bowls.
Cover the ramkins or bowls with the mozzarella cheese, and place
under broiler until the cheese is melted and beginning to brown on
top. Serve with grated cheese. Makes 4 to 6 servings.
