Categories: Desserts, Country liv, Puddings, Vegetables
Yield: 8 servings
1 tb Vanilla extract
2 ts Ground ginger
2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Dark seedless raisins
Ginger Sauce (recipe
-follows)
1 lb Loaf unsliced bread
-(preferably challah or
-other sweet bread)
2 c  (1 pt) half-and-half
6    Large eggs
1 c  Cooked pumpkin puree or
-canned pumpkin
2/3 c  Sugar
1. Heat oven to 350'F. Butter a 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan. Trim and
discard all crusts from bread-cut remaining bread into 1 1/2-inch
cubes.

2. In large bowl, with wire whisk, beat together half-and-half, eggs,
pumpkin, sugar, van Ila, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. Add cubed
bread and raisins to egg mixture, stirring to cover all pieces. Let
stand until bread absorbs most of the liquid-about 5 minutes.

3. Transfer bread mixture to prepared pan. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or
until firm to touch. Meanwhile prepare Ginger Sauce.

4. To serve, unmold warm bread pudding onto cutting board; slice into
8 pieces. Ladle some Ginger Sauce onto each serving plate. Cut slices
in half diagonally, as pictured, and place on top of Ginger Sauce;
serve immediately.

Ginger Sauce: In small saucepan, combine 1 C half-and-half and 1 tea-
spoon chopped fresh gingerroot; heat to boiling. In medium-size bowl,
beat together 3 large egg yolks and 2 tablespoons sugar. Slowly beat
half-and-half mixture into yolk mixture. Pour all back into saucepan
and cook, stirring constantly, over lowheat until sauce thickens
slightly and coats a spoon. (Do not boil.) Chill to thicken. Just
before serving, strain to remove gingerroot pieces.
