stems, ribs, and seeds from jalapenos; finely chop jalapenos and add

cardamom, and black pepper. Set aside, covered, at room temperature
until ready to serve, no longer than 1 hour. Refrigerate sauce if
serving more than an hour later.

2. Prepare Meat Filling: In large skillet, saute ground beef over
medium heat until well browned, stirring occasionally. Drain off any
fat in pan. Add onion, cumin, cardamom, chili powder, and pepper.
Reduce heat, cook, stirring, 10 minutes or until onion is tender.

strips. In medium-size bowl, combine romaine, tomatoes, and two

cheese and serve with Hot Sauce.

Note: David suggests that spices be freshly ground with a mokajete and
tejolate (Mexican mortar and pestle) just before use.
