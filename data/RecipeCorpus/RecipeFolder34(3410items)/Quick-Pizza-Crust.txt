2/3 c  Warm water
1 1/2 ts Vegetable oil

2 c  Flour -- divided
1 pk Fast rising dry yeast
2 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
Combine 1 c flour, yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Stir in

knead dough, fold dough in half toward you and press dough away from
you with the heels of your hands. Give dough a quarter turn and
continue folding, pushing, and turning.
