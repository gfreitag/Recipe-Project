Categories: Breads, Vegetables, Country liv
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
2 c  Hot milk
1    Green onion, finely chopped
-(2 T)
2    Large eggs, separated
2 ts Sugar
3 tb Butter
3 tb Fresh bread crumbs
3    Ears fresh corn, scraped
-(1 1/2 C)
1/3 c  Yellow cornmeal
1/2 ts Salt
1. Butter bottom and sides of 1 1/2-quart ovenproof souffle or deep
casserole dish with 1 T butter; dust lightly with bread crumbs.

2. In 2-quart saucepan, combine corn, cornmeal, salt, and pepper;
stir in hot milk. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat, until
mixture comes to a boil and thickens.

3. In small skillet, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Add green
onion and saute until just softened-5 minutes. Add onion and butter
to the cornmeal mixture.

4. In medium-size bowl, beat egg yolks until light. Stir 2 T  hot
corn- meal mixture into yolks; stir yolk mixture into remaining
cornmeal mixture until well combined. (The spoon bread may be made
ahead to this point, covered, and refrigerated, and carefully
reheated to lukewarm before adding egg whites.)

5. Heat oven to 325'F. In medium-size bowl, combine egg whites and
sugar; beat until stiff but not dry. Stir large spoonful of egg
whites into cornmeal mixture to lighten it; then fold remaining
whites into mixture. Pour spoon-bread mixture into prepared dish;
place dish inside larger pan and add hot water to a depth of 1 inch
up side of dish. Bake 45 to 60 minutes, or until knife inserted in
center comes out clean. Serve spoon bread immediately.
