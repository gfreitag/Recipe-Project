Title: GAME SAUCE FOR PRAIRIE CHICKEN
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Game, Tex/mexican
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Ground sage
1/2 ts Lemon juice
1 c  Chicken broth
1 tb Butter
1 1/2 tb Flour
1/4 c  Light cream
1 tb Dry sherry or to taste
Drain the grease from the roasting pan used for Prairie Chicken. Add
the chicken broth to the pan and place over heat, scraping the sides
and bottom of the pan to loosen the drippings. Skim off any remaining
grease. Set the pan aside while making the roux.

In a saucepan melt the butter and stir in the flour until blended.
Pour in the chicken broth and drippings from the roasting pan, and
cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture is smooth. Add the cream
and cook until the sauce bubbles and thickens. Add the sherry,
seasonings, and lemon juice. Stir and serve in a warm gravy boat.

Yield:  About 1 cup.
