Title: Rosemary Rice with Walnuts
Categories: Side dish, Vegetarian, Herbs/spice, Companion
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Chopped celery
1    Garlic clove; minced
1/2 c  Small walnut pieces
2 1/2 tb Chopped fresh rosemary
1 tb Tamari or shoyu
1 c  Brown basmati rice
1 3/4 c  Water
1/4 ts Sea salt
1 tb Olive oil (may be doubled)
1 md Onion; chopped
Wash and drain the rice and place it in a heavy saucepan over medium
heat. Let the rice dry out somewhat and begin to toast lightly, then
add the water and salt.  Bring to the boil, boil for 1 minute, then
cover and cook over low heat without stirring for 40 minutes.  Let
the rice rest for 10 minutes before removing the lid.  Fluff the rice
with a rice paddle or fork.

While the rice is cooking, heat the oil in a skillet and add the
onion, celery, and garlic.  Saute for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the
walnuts and rosemary and saute about 5 minutes longer.  Add the
tamari or shoyu and mix well.  Combine the sauteed mixture with the
rice.

Serve immediately or reheat in a casserole.

Variation: Add 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms along with the walnuts.
