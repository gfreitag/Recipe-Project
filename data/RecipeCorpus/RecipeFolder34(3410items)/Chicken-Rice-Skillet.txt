1 1/4 c  Rice, quick, uncooked
1 tb Oil
1/4 c  Green onions, chopped
1    Garlic cloves, crushed
2    Chicken breasts, boneless
1 cn Cream of mushroom soup
Cut chicken into thin strips.  Heat oil in skillet. Add onions and
garlic and cook two minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add chicken.
Cook until browned on all sides.

Stir in soup, milk, mushrooms, and pepper.  Heat to boiling.  Add
rice; reduce heat to low.  Cover; simmer until done, stirring
occasionally. Garnish with additional chopped green onions.

Sylvia's comments:  This is a keeper.  Quick, easy, and VERY low-fat
if you trim the fat from the chicken, use Campbell's fat-free soup
and low-fat milk.  I threw in 1/2 lb frozen green beans, too, since I
like all-in-one meals.
