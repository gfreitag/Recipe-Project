Title: Boiled Dry Raw Peanuts In The Shell
Categories: Snacks
Yield: 11 servings
1 ga Water
3 tb Salt (to 1/4 cup)
24 oz Bag raw peanuts
-in the shell
-large Virginia type
While this isn't the famous boiled "green" peanut of peanut growing
areas, boiling dried raw peanuts in the shell results in a delicious,
slightly sweet, peanutty bean snack. Boiled, the high fat peanut is a
bit easier to digest. Boil up a batch, divide and freeze for ready to
shell snacks or as tasty additions to grain, green or bean salads.

Rinse peanuts, drain and place in a large saucepan, cover with wataer
and add salt to taste. Adjust heat to lowest setting, allowing water
to slowly reach a very gentle simmer, stir occasionally, and cook
until tender. this will take at least 4 hours, most likely 6.

Begin testing for tenderness (cool and shell one or two) after about 4
hours. You want the peanut kernel to have a soft tenderness typical of
canned chickpeas or kidney beans; nut crunchy, not mushy. When the
kernels reach that point remove the peanuts from heat and drain. If
the peanuts sit in the salty cooking water they will absorb more salt
as they cool. (If you'd like them to taste saltier, let them sit
inthe salt water longs. If not, drain as is; if too salty, rinse.)
Handle boiled peanuts like cooked beans, serve at once or refrigerate
for up to 5 days. Do not leave them sitting out.
