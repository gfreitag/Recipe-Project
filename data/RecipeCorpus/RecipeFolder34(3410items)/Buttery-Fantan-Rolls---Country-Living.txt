Categories: Breads, Country liv
Yield: 36 rolls
1/2 c  (1 stick) butter, softened
2    Large eggs
1 ts Salt
2 tb Milk
1 pk Active dry yeast
1 1/2 c  Warm water (110' to 115'F)
1/4 c  Sugar
5 c  To 5 1/2 C  unsifted
-all-purpose flour
1. In large bowl, sprinkle yeast over 1/2 C  warm water. Stir in
sugar and let mixture stand until foamy-about 5 minutes.

2. With wooden spoon, beat 4 1/2 C flour, the remaining 1 C  warm
water, 4 T  (1/2 stick) butter, 1 egg, and the salt into the yeast
mixture until smooth. Stir in enough additiona1 flour to make a
manageable dough.

3. Tom dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead dough, adding
more of the remaining flour if necessary, until dough is smooth and
elastic-about 8 to 10 minutes.

4. Wash, dry, and lightly oil mixing bowl. Place dough in oiled bowl,
turning to bring oiled side up. Cover with clean cloth; let dough
rise in warm place, away from drafts, until double in size-50 to 60
minutes.

5. Meanwhile, in small bowl, beat remaining egg and the milk to make
egg wash.

6. When dough has doubled, melt remaining 4 T  butter. Brush
thirty-six 1 1/2-inch muffin-pan C with 2 T  of the melted butter.

7. With floured rolling pin, roll out dough into a 15-inch square.
Brush top with remaining melted butter and then brush with some of
egg wash. Cut dough into twelve 1 1/4-inch strips. Cut each dough
strip in half crosswise. Stack 4 strips dough on top of one another
and cut into 1 1/4-inch-square pieces to make fantan rolls. Repeat
with remaining strips of dough.

8. Place rolls, with a cut edge up, in prepared muffin-pan C. Cover
with clean cloth; let rolls rise, away from drafts, until double in
size-35 to 45 minutes.

9. Heat oven to 350'F. Brush tops of rolls with remaining egg wash.
Bake rolls 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool fantan rolls
completely on wire rack; store in airtight container up to two days.

10. Fantan rolls can be frozen, tightly wrapped, for several weeks. To
reheat, defrost rolls; heat oven to 400'F. Sprinkle rolls with a
little water, wrap in aluminum foil, and heat in oven 5 to 10 minutes.
