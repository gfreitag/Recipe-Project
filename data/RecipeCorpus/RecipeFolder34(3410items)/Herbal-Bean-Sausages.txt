These plant-based sausages taste great, contain no added fat except
the vegetable oil they're fried in, and are easy to make.  These
ingredients yield fairly mild sausages; after you've tried them,
adjust the seasonings to please your palate.

DIRECTIONS: =========== Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl, mix
thoroughly, and shape into 1- to 2-inch sausages. Saute in a small
amount of vegetable oil until crisp, or place in a baking pan and
broil, turning when edges are slightly crisp. Serve with Mushroom-Red
Pepper Sauce (below).

MUSHROOM-RED PEPPER SAUCE:  Cook red pepper in vegetable broth for 5
to 7 minutes until tender.  Add mushrooms, onion, salt, celery seed,
oregano, and black pepper.  Cook 5 minutes longer or until onion is
transparent. Quickly whisk in enough flour to just thicken the sauce,
about 2 tablespoons at a time.  Immediately remove from burner.  Do
not overcook, or flour will cake.  If needed, add more vegetable
broth or water. Serve over sausages, whole grains, or vegetables.
