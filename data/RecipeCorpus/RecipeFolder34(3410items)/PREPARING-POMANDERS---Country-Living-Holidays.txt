1. Using bamboo skewer, toothpick, or ice pick, puncture skin of
orange and insert clove. Repeat in rows as close together as possible
to cover fruit completely with cloves. If desired, leave narrow

the fruit once it dries. Repeat the studding process on lemon and
kumquat.

Roll clove-studded fruit in orrisroot mixture; shake off excess. Wrap
