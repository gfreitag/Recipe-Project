calories per serving,19 gr fat) (note) The last time I made this, I
doubled the sauce amount. I cooked the vegetables and removed them to
a bowl; heated the meat in the wok and removed it to the bowl. I put
only 1/4 cup of water in the doubled sauce. Placed the sauce in the
wok and after it started to thicken, I added chicken broth until the
sauce was the right consistency. Then add the vegetables and meat.
Toss gently to coat with sauce.
