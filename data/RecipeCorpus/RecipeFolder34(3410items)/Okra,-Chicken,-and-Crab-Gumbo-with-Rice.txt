the dry roux and slowly blend in the water. Add the bay leaf, thyme,

the crab and the chicken, cover the pot, and continue simmering for
30 minutes.

TO SERVE: Spoon the gumbo into warm soup bowls and top with 1/2 cup
rice in the center of each. Serve immediately.

NOTE: Since the roux is made before you start the gumbo (always be
sure that it is), there are no tricks to getting this right. The
preparation is as simple as it sounds and as delicious as some far
more complicated preparations.

VARIATIONS: There are as many different preparations of gumbo as
there are cooks.  Make your own substitutions and calculate the
dietary differences by using the Dietary Analysis published by both
the Canadian and U.S. Governments.  Remember though, keep it light!
