This is a recipe of proportions.  Begin with one of the first fruits
of the season.  Put equal proportions of fruit and sugar, 1 cup of
each, into small crock or large jar.  Stir lightly.  Cover and let
stand until strawberries release some juice.

Pour rum over top until it reaches 1/2 to 3/4 inch above top of
fruit. Stir to dissolve sugar.  Place plate or bowl over top to keep
fruit submerged. Cover loosely and store in cool place for 4 weeks.

Add the next fruit in season.  Slice or cube as desired.  Add 1 cup
sugar to 1 cup fruit.  Add more rum to reache above fruit again.
Allow 1 week after adding last fruit before eating.

** NOTE **  Several fruits may be used at first following the same
proportions of fruit and sugar.  Cover fruit with rum.  You can
simply use a larger quantity of only 1 fruit if you desire.  Keeps
indefinitely as long as fruit is covered with rum.  Makes whatever
quantity you choose.
