Chicken has always been looked on as a low-fat meat and when it has
been skinned even more of the fat disappears. With the lemon and
artichokes this is a casserole for summer-time eating. The butter
beans thicken the sauce and add fibre.

Preparation: skin the chicken joints, peel and chop the onions, drain
the artichoke hearts.

Flash the chicken joints under a hot grill until sealed on both sides.
Soften the onion in the oil in a flameproof casserole and add the
chicken joints. Add the lemon rind and juice to the casserole with
the butter beans and the liquid from the can. Cover and simmer for
20-30 minutes turning occasionally. Add the artichokes and cook for
another 10 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
