Title: Sauted Thin Fish Fillets
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
-at 1 1/2-inch intervals
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tb Butter, oil or combo
1 1/2 lb Thin fish fillets
-4 ea 1/2-inch thick
-rinsed and dried with
-paper towels, skin scored
Note: fold the tail end under to fit all four fillets into one pan

Heat one large or two medium skillets over medium heat until a drop of
water beads up and evaporates, 2-3 minutes. Increase heat to
medium-high; add butter and/or oil to pan (or 1 tbs to each pan).
Season fish with salt and pepper to taste. When foaming subsides or
oil starts to shimmer, add fillets, skin side up, to the pan or pans.
Cook until golden brown, 2-3 minutes, occasionally shaking pan gently
to keep fillets from sticking. Turn fish with spatula. If fillet is
very thin, turn heat off immediately, allowing residual heat from pan
to finish cooking fish. If fish is a little thicker, continue to cook
over medium-high heat for 1 minute, then turn off heat and allow
residual heat to finish cooking. Serve immediately.
