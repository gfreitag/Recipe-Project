Title: Chili Pizza, Wes Pitts, V3.0
Categories: Pizza, Chili
Yield: 1 pizza
1    Small can chopped blk olives
Cheddar, grated 2/3 cups
2 c  (16 oz) chili
1 ea Your favorite pizza dough
2 ea Beer
1/2 lb Sausage
'shrooms
Pre-heat your oven to as hot as that sucker'll go.  Use a pizza stone
if'n you got one.

*  Use mild Cheddar.  Trust me. ** If'n you use canned chili, that's
OK, as long as it ain't got no BEANS. Home-made chili, a few days
old, is even better.  NO BEANS!! While the dough is rising, grate the
cheese, and saute the 'shrooms and sausage together. Drink the beer.
You got plenty of time. Roll the dough out so it kinda looks like a
pizza. You know, kinda round? Or, make it like a rectangle and call
it a bigfoot. Add the toppings in this order: chili,
sausage'n'shrooms, olives, cheese. Ten to 15 minutes in the oven
should do 'er. Plenty of time to drink the other beer.
