For the Crust : Mix the dry ingredients and then cut in the cold
butter, which you have sliced into butter-pat- sized pieces. Use a
pair of knives or a pastry blender or cool fingertips to combine the
fat and flour into crumbly bits. Try not to let the butter melt into
the flour, that's what makes pastry dough. A few fast buzzes on a
food processor does this job well. Now add the buttermilk gradually
to make a sticky dough. Mix until you can gather it into a ball with
floured hands. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for an hour. Now
roll the dough out into a rough circle or square or whatever on a
cookie sheet or pizza pan. If you'd rather you can pat and press it
into shape. It doesn't have to be thin, and will end up about as
thick as the pizza they used to serve in school.

For the Filling : Saute the Onions slowly in the butter just until
they melt into a golden transparency. Spread the onions over the
dough. Mix the sour cream and eggs and the seasoning, and pour over
the onions evenly. Bake for 10 minutes in an oven preheated to 450
degrees, and then turn the oven down to 350 degrees and bake for 40
to 45 minutes more. Serve warm or room temperature. Feeds 6 people.
