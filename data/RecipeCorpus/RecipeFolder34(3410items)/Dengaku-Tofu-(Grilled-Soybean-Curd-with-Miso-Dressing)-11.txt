Title: Dengaku Tofu (Grilled Soybean Curd with Miso Dressing) 11
Categories: Japanese, Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
Stripped from their stems
4 oz Shiro miso (white soybean
Paste) about 1/2 cup
Kona sansho (Japanese pepper
2    Cakes fresh tofu (soybean
Curd), cut into 8 pieces
Each 3/4 inch wide by 3
Inches long
1/4 lb Fresh spinach leaves
The appearance of skewered "tofu" decorated with white and/or green
"miso" may remind Americans of an ice-cream popsicle.  There, of
course, the resemblance ends, although "dengaku tofu" is treated as a
sweet course by the Japanese.  The greencolored "miso" is made, in
Japan with ground "sansho" leaves, which are not available in the
United States. spinach makes an admirable substitute, with packaged
"sansho" powder added for flavor.

PREPARE AHEAD: 1. Preheat the broiler to its highest point. Place the
pieces of tofu side by side in a flameproof baking dish just large
enough to hold them in one snug layer. Add enough cold water to come
halfway up the sides of the tofu, then slide the dish under the
broiler, as close to the heat as possible.  Sear the tofu for a few
seconds, then turn the pieces with a spatula and sear the other side.
The tofu will be speckled but not evenly browned.  Remove the pan
from the broiler and set aside.

2.  In a 1 1/2 to 2 quart saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.
Add the spinach leaves and boil uncovered for about 2 minutes.  Then
drain in a sieve and run cold water over the spinach to cool it
quickly and set its color.  Squeeze the spinach firmly to rid it of
all its moisture and chop it fine.
In a suribachi (serrated mixing bowl) or with a mortar and pestle,
pound or mash the spinach to a paste.  Then with the back of a large
spoon, rub it through a fine sieve into a mixing bowl.

3.  Stir half of the shiro miso and a few sprinkles of kona sansho
into the spinach, continuing to stir until the miso paste has turned
a delicate green.

4.  Place the remaining shiro miso in a small bowl and mix until
smooth.

TO COOK and SERVE:
Over moderate heat, bring the pan of seared tofu (with the water
still in the pan) almost to the boil.  Remove from the heat and spoon
the green miso dressing into a pastry bag equipped with a No. 47
ribbon tip. Squeeze the miso dressing along the top of 4 pieces of
tofu, covering the top of each piece. (Lacking a pastry bag, spread a
thin film of miso on each piece of tofu with a spatula, and run the
prongs of a fork down the miso to create serrated lines).  Cover the
remaining tofu with the plain miso.
Insert two 4 to 6 inch bamboo skewers or small lobster forks halfway
through the length of each piece of tofu.  Return the tofu to the
water in the baking dish and sear under the broiler for a few
seconds. Serve at room temperature, as the sweet course in a Japanese
meal.
