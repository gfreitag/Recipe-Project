1. Slice the zucchini and squash lengthwise into 1/8-inch strips on a
mandoline. (If you don't have a mandoline, the backside of a
spatula-shaped cheese slicer is just as effective.) Be sure the
zucchini slices are not stuck together.

2. Heat the olive oil over high heat in a large skillet. Just before
the olive oil begins to smoke, add the cut squash and stir. Continue
stirring for 3 to 4 mins, or until the squash strips are barely
wilted, Add the white wine, garlic, salt, and pepper. Toss in the
basil and tomatoes. Stir in the tomato sauce, heavy cream, and half
the Parmigiano. Bring to a boil. Serve immediately with the remaining
Parmigiano sprinkled on top.
