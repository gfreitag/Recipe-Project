Title: Tips for Perfectly Grilled Beef
Categories: Information, Meats
Yield: 1 servings
NO INGREDIENTS
For charcoal grilling, light the briquets about 30 minutes in advance.
Begin grilling when coals are covered with a light ash and are no
longer flaming.  Grill all beef cuts over medium to medium-low
termperature coals. Coals too hot can cause beef to overcook on the
outside before the interior reaches the desired doneness.

Beef is at its most flavorful when cooked just to the proper doneness
and not overcooked.  Determine doneness of steaks by making a small
slit near the bone and checking color; for boneless cuts, make a slit
near the center.

Medium Rare--Center is very pink, and slightly brown toward the
exterior.

Medium--Center is light pink; outer portion is brown.

Well Done--Uniform brown throughout.

Use long-handled tongs for turning steaks; spatulas for turning
burgers. Do not use a fork, which pierces the beef allowing flavorful
juices to escape.
