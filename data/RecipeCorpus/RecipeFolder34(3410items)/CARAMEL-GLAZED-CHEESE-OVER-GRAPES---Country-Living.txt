-sugar
Mint sprigs
Soft Yogurt Cheese (recipe
-follows)
1 lb Green or red seedless
-grapes, stems removed
1. The day before serving, prepare Soft Yogurt Cheese.

2. Preheat the broiler. Place grapes in an even layer in a 9-inch
metal pie pan or shallow baking pan. Spoon Soft Yogurt Cheese over
grapes to cover them.

3. Press brown sugar through a sieve or small strainer evenly onto the
cheese and broil 3 inches from the heat 3 to 5 minutes or until the
sugar melts and caramelizes. Do not let the sugar burn. Spoon warm
dessert into small bowls and garnish with mint sprigs. Serve
immediately.

Soft Yogurt Cheese: Line a small colander or very large strainer with
a triple thickness of cheesecloth and place over a medium-size bowl.
Spoon one 32-oz container vanilla nonfat yogurt into lined colander;
let drain at room temperature 1 hour. Discard room temperature whey
in bowl. Tie cheesecloth around yogurt and transfer to a smaller
strainer placed over a small bowl. Refrigerate until yogurt is
reduced to 2 C or half the amount-about 6 to 7 hours. For this
dessert, the yogurt cheese should be the consistency of sour cream
rather than that of cream cheese. if it is too stiff, like cream
cheese, stir in some of the whey that dripped into the small bowl.
