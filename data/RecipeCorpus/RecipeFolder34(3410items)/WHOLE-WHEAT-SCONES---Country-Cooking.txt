Categories: Country coo, Breads
Yield: 8 scones
3/4 c  (1 1/2 sticks) butter
1/2 c  Dark seedless raisins (opt)
1 1/2 c  Milk
2 tb Unprocessed wheat bran
2 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
2 c  Unsifted whole-wheat flour
2 tb Sugar
4 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
1. Heat oven to 425'F. Grease large baking sheet. In large bowl,
combine the flours, sugar, baking powder, and salt. With pastry
blender or 2 knives, cut the butter in until mixture resembles coarse
crumbs. Stir in raisins, if desired.

2. Add 1 1/3 C milk to dry ingredients and mix lightly with fork until
mixture clings together and forms a soft dough.

3. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead gently 5 or 6
times. Divide dough in half. With lightly floured rolling pin, roll
one half of dough into a 7-inch round. Cut into 4 wedges. Repeat with
remaining half of dough.

4. Place scones, 1 inch apart, on greased baking sheet. Pierce tops
with tines of fork. Brush tops with remaining milk and sprinkle with
bran.

5. Bake scones 15 to 18 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
