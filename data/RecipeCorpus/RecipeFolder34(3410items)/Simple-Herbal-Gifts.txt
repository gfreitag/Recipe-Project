Title: Simple Herbal Gifts: Good Bread Herbs
Categories: Herbs/spice, Companion
Yield: 1 batch
1 ts Dill seed
4 ts Caraway seed
2 ts Dried sage; crumbled
1 ts Dried rosemary
Include your favorite white or wheat bread recipe with this herb
blend. We've decorated our muslin bag with herbal rubber stamp art
for a festive touch.

This amount will flavor two average loaves.

[Karen's note: The picture in the article is really cute!  They've
got a loosely-woven unbleached muslin cloth bag, drawn closed with a
drawstring, and very faintly stamped with a two-tone herbal print
(looks like basil).]
