Title: STRAWBERRY CHEESE MOUSSE - Country Living
Categories: Country liv, Desserts, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
-cream
2 pt Baskets strawberries
4 lg Egg whites, at room temp.
2/3 c  Sugar
1/4 c  Strawberry jelly
1 pk Unflavored gelatin
1/4 c  Orange juice
1 ts Vanilla extract
1    16-oz carton nonfat cottage
-cheese
1/4 c  Light or reduced-fat sour
1. In small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over orange juice; let stand 5
minutes to soften. Heat gelatin mixture over low heat just until
gelatin dissolves. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla and set aside.

2. In food processor with chopping blade, process cottage cheese and
sour cream until smooth, scraping side of container frequently. With
processor motor running, pour gelatin mixture through the feed tube
into the cheese mixture. Process until smooth; set aside. Rinse 1
pint strawberries, pat dry, hull, and slice.

3. In large bowl, with electric mixer, beat egg whites until foamy.
Slowly add sugar while beating constantly; continue to beat until
stiff peaks form. Fold cheese mixture and then the sliced berries
into the beaten whites. Pour mixture into 1 1/2 quart bowl and
refrigerate until set-at least 6 hours or overnight.

4. About 30 minutes before serving, in a small saucepan, or
microwave-safe bowl, melt jelly. Remove from heat and cool
slightly-about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse, dry, and hull remaining
strawberries. Dip strawberries into the melted jelly and place,
hulled side down, on small plate. Refrigerate until jelly sets, about
15 minutes. Arrange the glazed strawberries on top of the mousse.
