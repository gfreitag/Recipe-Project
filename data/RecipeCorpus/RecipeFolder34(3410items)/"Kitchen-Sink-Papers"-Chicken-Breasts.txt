This is simple and quick and very good.  It's named after the book the
Chicago journalist Mike O'Grady wrote about being a househusband. Heat
butter in a large skillet.  Dredge chicken breasts in flour seasoned
with salt and pepper.  Put the chicken in the hot pan and quickly
saute, adding the minced rosemary and the wine.  Cook only about
1-1/2 minutes per side, turning once.  When the chicken has turned a
light golden, remove from pan and place on top of the bed of spinach.
Deglaze the pan with a tablespoon more of wine; pour over the top.
Cover the casserole with a lid or a foil cover and bake at 375 for
about twenty minutes, or until done. The rosemary does something
marvelous to the flavor of the spinach.
