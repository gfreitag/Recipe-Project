Categories: Country coo, Cake/cookie, Chocolate
Yield: 5 dozen
2 ts Vanilla
2 1/4 c  Unsifted all purpose flour
1    1-oz square unsweetened
-chocolate, melted & cooled
3/4 c  (1 1/2 sticks) butter or
-margarine, softened
1/2 c  Sugar
2 lg Eggs
1. In medium-size bowl, beat together butter, sugar, eggs, and
vanilla. Stir in flour until soft dough forms.

2. Remove half of dough to cookie press fitted with serrated plate.
Stir chocolate into remaining dough and set aside. Line several
baking sheets or trays with waxed paper. Press plain dough out onto
waxed paper in long strips until all dough is used. Refrigerate dough
strips 30 minutes, or freeze 10 to 15 minutes or until firm.

3. Repeat with chocolate dough. When strips of dough are firm, remove
one sheet at a time of each color dough from refrigerator.

4. Heat oven to 350'F. Working quickly, trim rough edges of the
strips. Cut strips lengthwise in half and crosswise into 3-inch
pieces. For each cookie, arrange 4 pieces dough, alternating plain
and chocolate, with long sides touching on ungreased baking sheets.
Repeat with remaining dough.

5. Bake cookies 7 to 9 minutes, or until edges just begin to brown.
Watch carefully near end of baking time. Cool cookies completely on
wire rack. Store in airtight container.

Note: For a quicker version, divide each color dough in half. Pat
eacb half into a 3-incb strip about 1/2 inch thick. Stack,
alternating the colors. Wrap and refrigerate several bours or
overnight. Make 1/4-incb thick slices and bake as directed above.
Tbese cookies will take a little longer to brown.
