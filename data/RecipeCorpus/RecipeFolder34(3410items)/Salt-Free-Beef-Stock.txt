Title: Salt-Free Beef Stock
Categories: Soup/stew, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
1    Parsnip, cleaned and split
-in half
1    Or 2 small turnips, cleaned
-and split in half
2    Bay leaves
Dried thyme
5    Or 6 fresh parsley sprigs
12    Black peppercorns
4 qt Water
1 1/2 lb Meaty veal bones
1 1/2 lb Veal ribs
1 lb Beef spare ribs
2 md Onions
1/2 c  Vinegar
1    Fat leek, cleaned and split
-in half
2    Carrots, cleaned and cut in
-half
Preheat the oven to 400F.  Place the meat bones in a roasting pan.
Rub the loose skins from the onions but do not peel them.  Cut the
onions in half and add them to the pan.  Roast the bones and onions
for about 45 minutes or until the meats are browned and starting to
crisp on the edges.

Transfer the roasted meats and onions to a 6-quart stock pot.  Add the
vinegar to the roasting pan and place it over high heat.  Quickly
stir up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Pour the vinegar
into the stock pot.

Add the leek, carrots, parsnip and turnip to the stockpot, along with
the bay leaves, a pinch of thyme, the parsley, peppercorns and water.
Place over medium heat and slowly bring to a boil.  As soon as the
mixture begins to boil, reduce the heat to the lowest setting.
Partially cover the pot and barely simmer the stock for 4 to 5 hours.
Add a little boiling water from time to time, if necessary.

When the stock is done, remove the bones and vegetables.  Strain the
stock through a fine-mesh sive or acolander and set aside to cool to
room temperature.  Place the cooled stock in the refrigerator in the
refrigetrator, uncovered, to allow the fat to rise and coagulate.
Use a slotted spoon to remove the fat.

The de-fatted stock can be frozen until needed.  Or it can be boiled
over high heat until reduced by half or more to a syrup-like
consistency. The concentrated stock can also be frozen.
