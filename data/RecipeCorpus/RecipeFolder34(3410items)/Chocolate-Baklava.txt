1. In a small skillet, melt butter over low heat. Let stand a few
mins. Skim off and discard white foam from top and do not use any
milky residue that sinks to bottom. The clear yellow liquid is
clarified butter.

2. Preheat oven to 350 F. In a medium bowl, combine pecans, cinnamon,
1/4 cup sugar, and chocolate chips; mix well. Open and stack filo
sheets on a damp towel. Cover with a damp towel to prevent drying
out. Brush a 12 x 18-in sheet cake pan with clarified butter. Layer
half of filo sheets (about 10 x 12) in pan, brushing each sheet with
butter. Spread half of nut mixture evenly over layered filo sheets.
Brush next filo sheet on both sides with butter; then place on top of
nuts. Add 5 or 6 more filo sheets, brushing each sheet with butter.
Top with remaining nut mixture. Butter next filo sheet on both sides
and place on top of nuts. Top with remaining filo sheets, brushing
each with butter.

3. Using a sharp knife, cut pastry into 50 diamond-shaped pieces. Do
not remove pastry from pan. Brush top with remaining clarified
butter. Bake 40 to 50 mins, or until golden.

4. About 30 mins before baklava is finished baking, in a small
saucepan, combine remaining 1/2 cup sugar and orange juice. Heat to
boiling over medium heat, stirring often. Reduce heat to medium-low
and simmer 10 mins. Stir in vanilla. Pour hot orange syrup over hot
pastry as soon as it is removed from oven. Let stand until cool, 4
hours or over night.

5. When baklava is cool, drizzle Thin Chocolate Glaze on top. Allow
glaze to set up before serving. Baklava may be kept, covered, 4 to 5
days at room temperature. Freeze for longer storage.
