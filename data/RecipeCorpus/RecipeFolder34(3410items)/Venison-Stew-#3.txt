Title: Venison Stew #3
Categories: Soup/stew, Game
Yield: 1 servings
2    Bay leaves
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Pepper
1/2 ts Paprika
1 ds Allspice
2 lb Stew meat
6    Carrots
6    Potatoes
2 tb Oil
1 ts Worcestershire sauce
1 md Onion
Recipe by: Mrs.Ora Moore of Dillsboro, Indiana

Brown the cubed meat in the oil, add two cups of water, then the rest
of the ingredients. Cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours.  Remove bay leaves,
add carrots and potatoes, cook another 30-45 minutes or until tender.
As a footnote, I've just browned the meat, then dumped everything in
the "crockpot" on low. It produces a stew that tastes as tho' it
already been reheated several times.  IMHO, that's the best stew.
