Title: Hamburger Hot Dish (Just Basic Idea)
Categories: Meats
Yield: 1 servings
1 x  Pepper
1 x  Tomato sauce
1 x  Cooked noodles
1 x  Ground beef
1 x  Garlic powder
1 x  Celery salt
1 x  Onion powder
Brown ground beef, add seasonings and tomato sauce, simmer 5 minutes.
Mix with cooked noodles, simmer 10 minutes to blend flavors.

To make this for two people, I would use 1/2 pound of lean ground
beef, drain the fat after browning.  I use about 1/2 of a package of
very thin noodles (or vermicelli) and a 16 oz can of no-salt tomato
sauce. I now use celery powder instead of celery salt. I often make
extra of this and use it for a lunch.  It re-heats well.
