Title: SOUTHERN PEACH BRANDY
Categories: Beverages, Fruit, Alcohol
Yield: 1 servings
Makes 3 quarts
Wash one dozen large, ripe freestone peaches well and cut them in
half. Discard the stones.  In a sterile 1 gallon crock with a lid,
combine 2 pounds sugar and a fifth of good gin.  Stir to dissolve.
Add the peaches and stir to cover.  Cover with the lid plus a clean
kitchen cloth to keep the dust off.

Set in a fairly cool dark place where it can ferment almost
undisturbed for a few months.  Several days later, check the brew and
add more liquor if necessary. Taste for sweetness.  You can add more
sugar at this time.

Keep the jar covered until lage November.  Anytime after that strain
the brew thru a fine wire mesh sieve or several layers of clean
cheesecloth. Put the fruit into a large wide-mouth jar with a lid,
add some of the brandy and use to serve with sweetened whipped cream,
pound cake or vanilla ice cream for dessert.  Bottle the liquor in
pretty decanters to have on hand for the holidays, for gifts and
parties.
