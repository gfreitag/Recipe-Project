Title: MYSTERY SYRUP - Country Cooking
Categories: Country coo, Syrups
Yield: 1 1/4 cup
2 c  Sugar
4 c  Cut-up fresh rhubarb
-(3/4-inch pieces)
Sally often uses 2 T of finely chopped sweet cicely to replace 1 C of
the sugar in making this syrup.

1. In medium-size bowl, combine rhubarb and sugar. Cover and let
stand at room temperature 4 hours, stirring occasionally, until most
of sugar dissolves. Refrigerate rhubarb overnight. Into a 2-quart
saucepan, strain syrup from rhubarb. (Set aside rhubarb and reserve
for another use. To cook, see Note.)

2. Stir any undissolved sugar that remains in bowl after straining
rhubarb) into the rhubarb syrup and heat to boiling. Boil 3 minutes
or until the syrup "sizzles and hisses" as you stir it.

Note: Place the set-aside rhubarb in microwave-safe bowl. Cover and
microwave on bigh (100 per-cent) for 4 minutes or until tender. Serve
cooked fruit warm or chilled and topped witb ice cream or yogurt.
Makes 1 1/3 C.
