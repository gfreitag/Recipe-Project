Title: Sauteed Broccoli Rabe With Garlic
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Kosher Salt
1/8 ts Black Pepper -- freshly
-ground
3/4 c  Water
4    Lemon Wedges
2 lb Broccoli Rabe, Wash, Discard
-Largest Stems
1/4 c  Olive Oil, Extra-Virgin --
-plus more/drizzling
2 ts Garlic -- finely minced
1/3 ts Red Pepper Flakes -- dried
1. Separate the leaves from the florets of the broccoli rabe. Chop the
leaves and their stems into 2- to 3-inch pieces.

2. In a 3-qt. saucepan or skillet large enough to hold all the
broccoli rabe, combine the olive oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes.
Cook over moderately high heat for about 45 seconds to flavor the
oil, but do not allow the garlic to brown. Add the broccoli rabe. The
pan will be overflowing, but the broccoli rabe will lose considerable
volume during cooking. Continuously toss with tongs or a kitchen fork
to avoid any browning of the greens. It will take 1 to 2 mins to wilt
the broccoli rabe.

3. Add the salt and peppeer, toss, and cook approximately 1 min
longer. Add the water and cook until tender, 3 to 5 mins. Any water
that does not evaporate will blend with the olive oil to create a
flavorful juice for the broccoli rabe, and should definitely be
served. Garnish with the lemon wedges and a light drizzle of olive
oil.
