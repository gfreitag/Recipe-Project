Title: DON CARMEN'S BATTER-FRIED FRENCH TOAST - Country Cooking
Categories: Country coo, Breakfast
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 tb Butter
Ground cinammon (opt.)
Maple syrup (opt.)
1    1 lb (about 8 inches long)
-rectangular loaf unsliced
-challah or egg bread
1 lg Ripe banana sliced
4 lg Eggs
1 1/2 c  Milk
1. With bread knife, trim short ends from challah. Cut bread
crosswise into four 1 1/2-inch-thick slices. With small sharp knife,
on one edge of each bread slice, make an incision horizontally to
center of bread to create a pocket. Stuff each pocket with one fourth
of the banana slices, being careful not to poke a hole through the
top or bottom of the bread.

3. In pie plate or shallow dish, beat 3 eggs and 1/2 C milk. In
medium-size bowl, beat remaining egg with wire whisk. Gradually beat
in remaining 1 C milk, the flour, sugar, and vanilla until smooth.

4. In large skillet, heat 1 T butter over medium heat. Dip stuffed
bread slices into egg-milk mixture, and then into flour mixture until
bread is saturated. Reduce heat to low and fry bread slices, turning
once to brown both sides-about 7 minutes on each side. If necessary,
cook French Toast in batches, using more butter as needed. Sprinkle
slices with cinnamon, if desired. Cut slices in half diagonally and
place 2 halves onto each serving plate. Serve immediately. Add maple
syrup, if desired,
