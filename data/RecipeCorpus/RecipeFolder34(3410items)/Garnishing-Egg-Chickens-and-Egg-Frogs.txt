Another delightful garnish to place in and around a deviled egg
platter is this chicken egg.  The chicken egg go over great at
children's parties.

1. To make the chicken egg, cut off 1/8 inch slices of carrot using
the garnishing knife.  Cut these round slices in half.

2.  Cut the egg to creat a flat bottom.  Use the small point of a
knife to make a slit near the end of the egg.  Insert the sliced
carrot piece for the tail.

3. Make another slit to place another piece of carrot for the comb.
Use small pieces of carrot for the beak and eyes.

The egg frogs will add excitement to children's parties and a
delightful touch to deviled or stuffed egg platter.

1. To make the egg frog, peel a hard cooked egg and cut a pie shaped
wedge from just below the center to form the mouth.

2. Cut the bottom of the egg to creat a flat surface. Next, take the
red pimento strip from a pitted stuffed olive to use for the tongue.
Cut 2 round slices from the olive to form the eyes.  Attach the eyes
egg yolk paste (egg yolk, salt, pepper, dry mustard, lemon juice and
mayonnaise)

3. Make a radish mushroom and turn upside down for the hat.  Attache
the hat with egg yolk paste.  Place the egg frogs on lettuce, endive
or parsley leaves.
