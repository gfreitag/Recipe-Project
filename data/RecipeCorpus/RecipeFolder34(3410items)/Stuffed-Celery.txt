Celery is always a pleasing garnish and it is another of the vegetable
garnishes which add an appetizing crunch to any meal.  Celery can be
used by itself or the stalks can be filled with any number of savory
mixtures such as cream cheese, smoke flavored cheese, deviled ham or
chopped liver. If a cheese mixture is used, it should be softened
with little milk to which you can add spices, chopped chives, onions
or parsley.

Any of the celery garnishes will add contrast and substance when used
as an appetizer or with salad and sandwich plates.  If you are going
to usse the celery hearts and would like to do something nice with
the outside stalks, then stuffing them is the answer.

1.  Wash and trim the leaves and bottom part of the stalks.

2.  Fill the trimmed stalks with any cheese spread which has been
softened with a little milk.  Add spices, chopped onions, chives or
parsley to the softened mixture and whip until smooth and fluffy.
Fill the inside of the stalks with this cheese mixture.

3.  Take the filled stalks and place them together, cheese to cheese,
then tie the stalks together with a little string and refrigerate.

4.  When ready to serve, remove the string, and cut the stalks
crosswise into bite sized slices.  Place these filled slices on a
relish tray or alongside a sandwich.
