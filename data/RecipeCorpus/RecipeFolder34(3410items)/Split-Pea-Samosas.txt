Oil
Cover the washed split peas with 2 cups water.  Add the turmeric & the
salt.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover & simmer.  Simmer until the
split peas just start to break up, about 35 to 45 minutes.  Do not
overcook.  Drain carefully.  Transfer to a mixing bowl & stir in the
cilantro.  Set aside.

DOUGH: Combine the flour, salt & oil.  Pour in enough water until the
flour congeals into a ball.  Knead vigorously for 10 minutes until
the dough is soft & pliable.  Wrap in a damp towel & let rest for at
least 30 minutes.

SPICES: Heat oil in a skillet, saute the onions until golden brown.
Add the asafetida & a few seconds later the rest of the spices in the
order listed. Saute, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Pour into
the prepared split pea mixture & let cool.

ASSEMBLY & COOKING: Divide the dough into 10 balls.  Roll each ball
out very thinly into a circle, but not so thinly that it will rip
when you pick it up.  Cut each resultant disk in half.  Set each half
aside, preferably covered with the damp towel to prevent drying.  Do
all the balls of dough in this way.

Take one halved disk, heap one tablespoon of split filling onto one
half of the disk.  Lightly dampen the edges of the dough with water &
seal into a triangular shape.  Repeat until all disks have been
fileld & sealed in this way.

Heat oil in a wok, enough to deep fry about 4 samosas at once.  When
the oil is hot, carefully drop 4 samosas into the wok.  Fry for 3 to
4 minutes & flip over.  The pastry should be a deep golden brown.
When cooked, remove with a slotted spoon & drain well.

Either serve immediately or let cool & freeze.  Reheat in an oven
preheated to 300F for 10 minutes or so.  Be careful as they will burn
very easily.
