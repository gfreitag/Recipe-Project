Title: COUNTRY WHITE BREAD - Country Living
Categories: Country liv, Breads
Yield: 2 loaves
4 c  To 5 C unsifted all-purpose
-flour
1 lg Egg
1 tb Water
1 ts Sesame seeds (opt.)
2 c  Milk
1 pk Active dry yeast
3 tb Sugar
1/4 c  (1/2 stick) butter
1 ts Salt
1. In small saucepan, heat milk until bubbles form around side of pan.
Remove 1/2 C milk to small bowl. Set aside to cool to 110' to 115'F,
then stir in yeast and 1 T sugar. Let mixture stand until foamy-5
minutes.

2. Meanwhile, add butter to remaining milk in saucepan; heat over low
heat, stirring, to melt butter. Pour milk and butter mixture into
large bowl; set aside to cool to 110' to 115'F.

3. Add remaining 2 T sugar, the salt, the yeast mixture, and 3 C
flour to milk mixture; with wooden spoon, stir to blend completely.
Stir in enough additional flour to make dough manageable.

4. Turn dough out onto floured surface. Knead dough, adding more
flour, if necessary, until smooth and elastic-8 to 10 minutes.

5. Wash, dry, and lightly oil mixing bowl. Place dough in oiled bowl,
turning to bring oiled side up. Cover with clean cloth; let dough
rise in warm place, away from drafts, until double in size-about 1
hour.

6. Grease two 8 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch loaf pans. Punch dough down. Turn
out onto floured surface and cut in half. Shape each half of dough
into a 9-inch loaf. Fit dough into greased pans and cover with a
clean cloth. Let rise until double in size-about 35 minutes.

7. Heat oven to 350'F. In small bowl, beat egg with water to make egg
wash. Brush loaves with egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds, if
desired. Bake loaves 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown and
breads sound hollow when tapped on top. Remove loaves from pans and
cool to room temperature on wire rack before cutting.
