A little of this warm, spicy blend goes a long way.  Coming from North
India, where meat is eaten more frequently than in the South, it is
the kind of masala that's popular as an accompaniment for almost any
meat dish, as a condiment or in the sauce.

Grind toasted ingredients with mace, peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon,
and bay leaf, and mix well with the other ground ingredients.
