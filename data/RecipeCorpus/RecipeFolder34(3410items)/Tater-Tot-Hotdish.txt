Brown ground beef and cook onions just until tender.  Drain excess
grease from ground beef.  Mix canned soup and frozen vegetables with
ground beef mixture.  Pour into a large baking dish and cover with
the frozen Tater Tots.  Bake approximately 25-30 minutes at 350

You can steam the vegetables prior to mixing with meat if you like.
That speeds up the cooking time.
