Title: Garden Rice Salad
Categories: Salads, Side dish, Pasta/rice, Vegetarian
Yield: 4 servings
MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
1/4 c  Green onions, chopped
1 tb Pine nuts
1 1/2 c  Brown rice, cooked
1 1/4 c  Tomatoes, chopped
3/4 c  Peas, lightly cooked
MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
1 pn Garlic powder
1/2 ts Oregano
1/2 ts Basil
2 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Olive oil
1/4 ts Black pepper
Toss together the sald ingredients in a medium bowl & set aside.

Mix together the salad dressing ingredients.  Pour over the salad,
continuing to stir as you pour.  Toss together & refrigerate until
ready to serve.

MARK'S NOTES:  I've found that a little more oil is needed, no more
than another 1 ts.  Lightly cooked corn is nice alternative to the
peas. In place of the garlic powder, use 1 minced garlic clove.
