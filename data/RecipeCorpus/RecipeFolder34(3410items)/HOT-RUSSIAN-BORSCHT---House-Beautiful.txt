In a large soup pot, place beef, onion, celery, carrot, parsnip, dill,
broth and water. Bring slowly to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, cov-
ered, for 1 1/2 hours, or until beef is very tender, skimming off any
foam that rises to the top. Remove short ribs, cool and set aside.

Strain the broth into a large bowl, cool slightly and skim off any
fat that rises to the top. Return defatted broth to a clean soup pot.
Shred meat from bones, discarding bones and any fat. Reserve.

Wash beets well and trim stems, leaving 1 inch of stem on beet. Wrap
beets individually in aluminum foil and bake in a preheated 350'F
oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until tender, depending on size. When
cool enough to handle, wear thin rubber gloves and slip skins off
beets and grate coarsely. Reserve.

Add sweet potatoes to broth, bring mixture to a boil over medium heat,
partially covered. Add cabbage and cook 5 minutes. Reduce heat to a
simmer, add reserved shredded meat, beets, lemon juice to taste and
caraway seeds. Season with salt and pepper and simmer 5 minutes.

Just before serving, stir in dill, parsley and garlic. Simmer borscht
1 minute and serve piping hot. Garnish individual servings with a
dollop of sour cream. Serves 8.
