minutes + marinating + 15-20 minutes baking.

A pretty dish with the pink lamb slices and the fresh green colour of
the puree. Keep the pink and green theme by serving it with green
noodles and a radichio and watercress salad.

Preparation: chop the rosemary, crush the garlic cloves, trim, wash
and slice the leeks.

Mix 5ml of the rosemary, the garlic and the lemon juice and brush
this over the lamb fillets. Leave to marinate for 2 hours. Preheat
the oven to Gas Mark 8/450F/230C. Put lamb and marinade on a shallow
baking tray and cover with foil loosely. Roast for no more than 15-20
minutes.

Cook the leeks in 15ml of chicken stock for 10 minutes. Drain them and
reserve the liquid. Puree the leeks in a blender or food processor
and pile onto a warm serving dish.

Drain any liquid from the lamb and put this in a small pan with the
leek stock and the remaining rosemary and chicken stock. Boil rapidly
until reduced by half.

Slice the lamb thinly and arrange around the puree. Pour the sauce
over the lamb slices.
