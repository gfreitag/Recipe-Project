Title: Quick Plant Pizza
Categories: Pizza, Vegetables
Yield: 6 servings
1 lb Plum tomatoes; seeded and
-chopped fine
2 tb Chopped fresh basil (or 1
-tablespoon dried basil)
2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
1 1/2 tb Chopped fresh oregano (or 1
-tablespoon dried oregano)
Pizza dough (see separate
-recipe "Pizza Dough
-'Crucial Crust'")
1 lg Eggplant; sliced into 1/4"
-rounds
6 ea Cloves garlic; minced
2 tb Olive oil
Note:  The softened eggplant in this recipe provides the chewy
texture you usually get from cheese, and the barely cooked tomatoes
really sparkle.

While preheating the oven to 500 degrees, press out the pizza dough.
Saute garlic, tomatoes, and herbs in one tablespoon of olive oil,
over low heat, for 5 minutes.  Spread most of the mixture over the
dough. Top with overlapping slices of eggplant.  Brush the remaining
olive oil and tomato mixture over the eggplant.  Bake for 25 to 30
minutes, or until the crust browns.
