Title: Canned Chicken, Rabbit or Ptarmigan
Categories: Can/preserv, Poultry, Game
Yield: 1 batch  Dress animals and cut up as for frying parts. Trim off all fatty
parts. Refrigerate fresh meat overnight. Set aside giblets for other
preparation; they discolor the meat when canned. Take the bony parts:
necks, backs and wing tips and prepare a broth with them. Strain the
broth and discard the bones. Add the meaty parts to the broth. Cook
until just done. Chill; remove congealed fat, de-bone and re-heat.
Pack the hot meat in jars and cover to within 1" of the top of the
jars with boiling broth, adding up to 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper
per quart. Process at 10 lb for 75 min [pints] to 90 min [quarts].
