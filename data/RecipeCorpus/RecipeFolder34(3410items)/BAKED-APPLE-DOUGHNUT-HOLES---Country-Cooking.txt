butter into the flour mixture until it resembles fine crumbs. Stir in
eggs and milk until soft dough forms. Fold in apples and nuts.

3. With floured hands, roll dough into 1-inch round balls to resembie
doughnut holes. Drop balls into muffin-pan cups. Bake 20 to 25
minutes or until golden brown.

heat. In medium-size plastic food-storage bag or paper bag, combine
remaining 3/4 C sugar, and the cinnamon. In batches of 3 or 4, drop
doughnut holes into melted butter to cover, immediately remove
doughnut holes with tongs or slotted spoon, and toss in bag to coat
