and cayenne pepper.  Cover and cook until peppers are very tender and
tomatoes are reduced to sauce consistency, stirring occasionally,
about 20 minutes. Uncover and cook until mixture is thick, about 14
minuters.  Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead.
Cover mixture and let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm before

Beat eggs in bowl until blended.  Melt butter in heavy large nonstick
skillet over low heat.  Add eggs and basil; stir constantly with
rubber spatula until soft curds form and eggs are barely set, about
12 minutes. Add pepper mixture and jambon de Baoyonne and stir just
to blend.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Mound piperade in center of platter.  Surrond with toast and serve.
