Categories: Poultry
Yield: 8 servings
1/2 ts Crushed red pepper
1/4 ts Ground ginger
8 lg Chicken breast halves
-skinned and boned
-pounded evenly
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 c  Cilantro, finely chopped
1/4 ts Cumin seeds
1/4 c  Plus 2 tb olive oil
1 tb Garlic, finely chopped
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
2 tb Red currant jelly
1 tb Lemon juice
1 ts Dijon mustard
1 ts Soy sauce
1. In a small dry skillet, toast the cumin seeds over moderate heat,
stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 2-3 minutes. Using a mortar and
pestle or a spice grinder, grind to a powder. Empty into a large bowl.

2. Heat 2 tbs of the olive oil in the skillet. Add the garlic and
cook over moderate heat, stirring, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add
to the cumin, then whisk in the vinegar, jelly, lemon juice, mustard,
soy sauce, crushed red pepper and ginger. Whisk in the remaining cup
olive oil. Add the chicken breast halves, turning to coat. Cover and
refrigerate for 1-2 hours.

3. Light a gas grill or preheat a cast-iron grill pan until hot.
Remove the chicken from the marinade and season on both sides with
salt and pepper. Cook the chicken, skinned side down, until nicely
seared with grill marks, rotating the pieces once or twice, about 4
minutes. Flip and cook the other side, rotating, until charred all
over and cooked through, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer to a
platter and sprinkle the cilantro on top. Serve warm or at room
temperature.
