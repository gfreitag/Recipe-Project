Title: Garnishing Celery Flutes
Categories: Information, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings
No Ingredients Found
1.  Clean pieces of celery and cut the stalks into 3 inch lengths.
Using the inner stlaks to make the flute will make it much more
tender and less stringy.  Hold the 3 inch stalk in one hand and with
the other hand, using a small knife, cut shot slices, keeping them as
close together and as straight as possible.

2. Make cuts from the outside end of the stalk toward the middle.  Cut
these slices about 1 inch deep cutting from the end to, but not
through, the middle.

3. When finished, turn the stalk around and do the other end in the
same way. Chill in ice water and refrigerate until the strips curl.
When ready to serve place these celery flutes on a relish tray along
with carrots curls, pickle fans or stuffed pickles, radish roses,
cucumber slices and black and spanish olives.
