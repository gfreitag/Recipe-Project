Title: Sharon's Yummy Pasta Dinner
Categories: Pasta/rice, Fish/seafoo, Meats
Yield: 6 servings
-shrimp (or more)
2 md Onions
Garlic
Parsley
Salt and pepper to taste
1    Bag pasta shells (about 1 lb
-depending on size of
-family)
1 lb Bacon, diced and cooked
-almost crisp (or more)
3 c  Fresh, or fresh frozen
Dice and cook bacon (stove top or microwave)  When almost crisp,
drain and lay on paper towel to remove as much grease as possible.
After bacon has been cooked, saute the onion until translucent.  Add
cooked bacon and onion to white sauce.  Add parsley and bring sauce
back up to heat. Cook pasta in large pot of water.  When cooked,
drain thoroughly and rinse with hot water.  Allow to drain a few
minutes and then shake off excess water. Melt a little bit of butter
in the pot that you cooked the pasta in, and then return the pasta to
the large pot. Remove from heat. By this time, the sauce should be
heated up.  Rinse and drain the fresh shrimp, shaking excess water
off it.  Add to white sauce mixture. Continue heating until steaming
but not boiling.  Pour sauce over pasta and heat over low heat until
mixture is thoroughly warmed through. (At this point, I use the
microwave to heat individual plates up as I always end up scorching
the bottom of the pot!)  Garnish with sprigs of parsley on the side,
or a shake of paprika on top.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Add the garlic and slowly bring to boil.  Continue cooking until good
