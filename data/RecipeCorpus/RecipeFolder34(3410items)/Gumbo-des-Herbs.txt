-or kielbassa
1 lb Smoked ham
1 lb Chaurice (hot)
1 lb Brisket stew meat
1 lb Brisket - bonless
5 tb Flour
1 ts Thyme leaves
1 ts Salt
1 ts Cayenne pepper
1 tb File powder
1 bn Mustard greens

Clean all vegetables, making sure to pick out bad leaves and rinse
away all grit.  In a large pot place all greens, onions and garlic.
Cover with water and boil for 30 minutes.  While this is boiling, cut
all meats and sausage into bite-size pieces and set aside.  Strain
vegetables after boiling and reserve liquid.  In a 12-quart stockpot
place brisket meats, ham, smoked sausage, and 2 cups reserved liquid
and steam for 15 minutes. While steaming, place chaurice in skillet
and steam until chaurice is rendered (all grease cooked out).  Drain
chaurice, keeping the grease in the skillet, and set aside.

All vegetables must be pureed. This can be done in a food processor
or by hand in a meat grinder.  Heat the skillet of chaurice grease
and stir in flour.  Cook roux for 5 minutes or until the flour is
cooked (does not have to brown).  Pour roux over meat mixture; stir
well. Add vegetables and 2 quarts of reserved liquid.  Let simmer for
20 minutes. Add chaurice, thyme, salt and cayenne pepper; stir well.
Simmer for 40 minutes. Add file powder; stir well and remove from
heat.

Serve over steamed rice.
