1    5-6 Lb Leg Of Lamb,
-Butterflied By Butcher
1/2 c  Golden Raisins
2 ts Lemon Zest -- grated
1/4 c  Mixed Chopped Frsh Herbs *
1 ts Kosher Salt
5/8 ts Black Pepper -- freshly
-ground
1 tb Garlic -- minced
* Choose your mix from the following by including at least 3 of them;
parsley, thyme, chives, mint, or oregano.

1. Place the raisins in a small saucepan with 1/3 cup water. Bring to
a boil and remove from the heat. Set aside to plump for 5 mins. Drain
the raisins and chop coarsely.

2. In a bowl, combine the raisins, lemon zest, herbs, 1/4 tsp salt,
1/2 tsp pepper, garlic, bread crumbs, balsamic vinegar, and 2 Tbs
olive oil. Stir with a wooden spoon to mix thoroughly.

3. Spread open the lamb and distribute the herb mixture evenly over
the inside surface. Close the lamb by rolling on end to meet the
other. Tie securely with kitchen string in several places. If any of
the herb mixture falls out while rolling the lamb, use your fingers
to stuff it back into any opening. Refrigerate for atleast 4 hours or
overnight.

4. Remove the lamb from the refrigerator and bring to room
temperature. Preheat the oven to 450 F.

5. Rub the lamb with 1 tsp olive oil and season with remaining salt
and pepper. Roast the lamb on a rack over a roasting pan. The lamb
should cook 12 to 15 mins per pound for rare to medium-rare. Or use a
meat thermometer to determine doneness: 125 F for very rare, 130 F
for medium rare, 140 F for medium, and 160 F for well done.

6. Remove the lamb from the oven and let rest for 20 mins. Remove the
strings and slice on a grooved platter to collect the natural juices.
Serves 6 to 8.
