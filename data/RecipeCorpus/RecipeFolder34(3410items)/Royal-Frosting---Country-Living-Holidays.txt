Title: Royal Frosting - Country Living Holidays
Categories: Country liv, Holiday, Cake/cookie
Yield: 2 cups
Paste or powdered food
-coloring (opt.)
1 lb Confectioners' sugar
3 lg Egg whites
1/2 ts Cream of tartar
1. In medium-size bodwl, with electric mixer, combine sugar, egg
whites, and cream of tartar just until well mixed. At high speed,
beat mixture until thick and fluffy.

2. Cover frosting tightly with a damp towel or plastic wrap while us-
ing. If desired, to color frosting, divide into small bowls and mix
in food coloring.

Note: This frosting is used not only to decorate or spread onto
cookies but also as an adhesive. Because of current health concerns
about salmonella in raw eggs, frosting on cookies that will be eaten
should be made from meringue powder instead of egg whites following
package instructions. For purely decorative cookies, we prefer this
egg-white frosting over the meringue-powder version because of its
stronger gluing property.
