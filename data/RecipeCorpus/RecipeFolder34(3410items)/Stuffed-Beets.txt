Hollow out beets, or use beets that have been used for making candy
cane garnishes.

Cook the hollowed out beets in lightly salted water until tender.
Cool and remove the skins.  Heat oven to 350F.  Mix the cheese, bread
crumbs, sour cream, pickle relish and seasonings.  Stuff the beets
with this mixture and place in a shallow greased baking dish.  Brush
with butter and bake uncovered in a 350 F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.
Melt the butter and mix with the white wine and baste occasionally to
keep moist.
