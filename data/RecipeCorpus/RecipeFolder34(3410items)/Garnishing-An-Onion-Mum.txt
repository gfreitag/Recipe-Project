**MY NOTES**  This has got to be the prettiest of all the garnishes I
have seen pictures of....

The onion mum looks like a lot of trouble to make, but it is one of
the easiest garnishes to do.  This garnish can be made in advance and
can also be tinted to produce soft pastel colors for use in floral
centerpieces.

Select a medium sized, well rounded white onion.  choose onions which
are uniformly tapered and avoid onions with a double growth inside.

Peel the outer skin of the vegetable.  Leave the root end intact but
cut off any roots.

1.  Use the smal sharp knife and starting at the top of the onion,
make a cut downward towards the root end.  Be careful not to go all
the ay to the root end but stop the cut about 1/2 inch from it.  Make
this cut deep into the center of the vegetable.  Make a second cut in
the same way and continue making these cuts until you have gone
completely around the onion.

2.  When you have completed cutting around the outside, place the
onion in a bolw of hot water.  This will start the petals spreading
and remove the onion acid smell.  Let soak for 5 minutes then replace
the hot water with ice water to allow the flower to bloom further.

3.  To color the onion mum, place food coloring in the ice water and
let soak until the desired tint is obtained.
