packing pickles Fill to top with cold tap water Seal jar and invert
jar several times to dissolve ingredients.

Let stand at room temperature for 24 hours and then refrigerate.
Ready to eat in two days (for half sour), let stand longer for
increased sourness.

(BTW: salt and vinegar may be varied to suit individual taste.)

A further addition from the master pickle maker.....

To make pickled green tomatoes....use the same recipe as above, but
add a 2 -3 inch piece of fresh celery stalk to the jar.  Let stand
for 5 weeks at room temperature, then refrigerate and enjoy...

Remember, do not use a bare metal top...the vinegar and salt will
rust it and give the pickles a bad taste...
