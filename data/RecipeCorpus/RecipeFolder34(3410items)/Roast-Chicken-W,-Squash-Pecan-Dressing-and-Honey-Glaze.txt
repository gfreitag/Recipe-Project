Title: Roast Chicken W/ Squash-Pecan Dressing and Honey Glaze
Categories: Poultry, Dress/stuff
Yield: 6 servings
1    Egg; beaten
1/4 c  Chopped Pecans
1/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Pepper
3 tb Apple Juice
2 tb Honey
1    Bacon strip
3 lb Chicken
1 tb Butter
1/2 c  Yellow squash; shredded
1/2 c  Zucchini; shredded
1/2 c  Onion; chopped
1/2 c  Celery; with leaves, chopped
1 1/4 c  Dry breadcrumbs
1    Clove garlic; minced
Reserve giblets and neck. Rinse chicken and pat dry. Set aside. In a
large skillet, melt butter. Add yellow squash, zucchini, onion,
celery, and garlic and saute until barely tender-crisp. Combine
vegetable mixture, breadcrumbs, egg, pecans, salt and pepper. Lightly
stuff the bird with dressing mixture, reserving any left overs. Truss
chicken and place it, breast side up, on a rack in a roasting pan.
Combine apple juice and honey. Brush chicken with half of apple
juice-honey mixture. Cover wing tips with foil to prevent
over-browning and drying out. Bake at 350 deg F for 1 1/2- 2 hours or
until drumsticks are easy to move and juices run clear, basting
occasionally with remaining apple-honey mixture.

Half an hour before the chicken is done, place the extra dressing in a
bread pan and lay the giblets and neck on it. Place the bacon strip
on the neck and place the pan in the oven beside the chicken. Remove
foil from the chicken wings at this point. Moisten the extra dressing
occasionally with a little of the pan juices from the chicken.
