1. Prepare Puffs: In 4-quart saucepan, heat water and butter to
boiling over high heat. Add flour, salt, and red pepper, stirring
vigorously until a thick batter forms. Reduce heat to low and cook,
stirring oc- casionally, 5 minutes. (Batter should pull away from
side of pan.)

2. Transfer batter to food processor fitted with chopping blade. Add
eggs and Cheddar cheese; process until well blended. Set aside 10
minutes to cool slightly.

3. Meanwhile, heat oven to 350'F; lightly grease 2 baking sheets. Drop
batter by the tablespoonful, 1/2 inch apart, on greased sheets. Bake
25 to 30 minutes or until puffed and golden brown. Cool puffs on
baking sheets on wire racks.

4. Meanwhile, prepare Vegetable-Cheese Filling: In large skillet,
melt 1 T butter over medium heat. Add onion and pine nuts; saute 5
minutes. Add spinach, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until
spinach is wilted-about 2 minutes. Transfer onion mixture to small
bowl and set aside.

5. In same skillet, melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Stir in
flour and cook 1 minute. Whisk in milk and water; cook, stirring
constantly, until mixture is very thick. Remove from heat and stir in
tomatoes, 1 C provolone cheese, the pepper, salt, and onion mixture.

6. Just before serving, heat oven to 350'F. Cut each puff in half
horizontally. Divide filling mixture among bottoms; replace tops of
puffs. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 C provolone cheese on top of puffs and
bake 12 minutes. Serve hot.
