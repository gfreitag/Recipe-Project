MMMMM---------------------CATSUP, OR KETCHUP--------------------------
Question: What is the difference between catsup and ketchup?

Answer: The name comes from either a pickled Chinese fish sauce,
spelled KETSIAP, or a Malay soy-based sauce spelled KETJAP. In 18th
century England, the word was KETCHUP, and it meant a salty condiment
made with elderberries, walnuts, mushrooms, oysters or anchovies.

In America, the term came to mean any pickled seasoning sauce made
with vinegar, spices and sugar. There are early recipes for highly
spiced fruit ketchups made to accompany meats.

Tomato ketchup -- the vinegary stuff that refuses to come out of the
bottle until your hamburger is good and cold--is an American
invention. The first commercial ketchup was produced by Heinz in
1876. Before that, homemakers were expected to make their own.

Ketchup is also sometimes written catsup, catchup or katsup. However
you spell it, the bottle should be stored in the refrigerator after
it is opened, and it will last indefinitely. A clean knife blade
stuck into the neck of a bottle and rotated a few times will help
things flow.
