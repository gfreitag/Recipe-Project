=====================> Notes and Credits <=====================

This dish is a legacy of the culinary mixing of the Caribbean. India's
curry spices up the goat meat that is an island staple. In the
States, goat meat can be found in butcher shops in Caribbean
neighborhoods or in Greek neighborhoods.
