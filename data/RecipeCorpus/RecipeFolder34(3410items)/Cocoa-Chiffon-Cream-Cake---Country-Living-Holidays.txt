MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------

1. Separate eggs one hour before preparing cake, if possible. Allow
whites to sit, covered, at room temperature for 1 hour. Put 4 yolks
in a cup; cover tightly and refrigerate until ready to continue
recipe. Refrigerate remaining yolks, covered, for use at another time.

2. When whites have come to room temperature, heat oven to 325'F. In a
medium bowl, gradually beat water into whites until smooth. Add 4
yolks and salad oil; beat until well combined.

3. Add cake flour, cocoa, 1 C sugar, baking soda, and salt. Beat just
until smooth; stir in vanilla.

4. Add cream of tartar to egg whites. Beat until fluffy. Continue
beating, gradually adding remaining 1/2 C sugar, until stiff peaks
form when the beater is raised.

5. Pour flour mixture over egg whites. Gently fold together just until
completely combined. Turn into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Bake
until cake springs back when gently touched-about 55 to 60 minutes.

6. Remove cake from oven and immediately invert pan. Let cool corn-
pletely, 1 to 1 1/2 hours, before removing from pan. In a large bowl,
combine cream, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and cocoa for filling.
Refrigerate.

7. To assemble, carefully loosen cake from pan; remove pan and invert
cake on serving plate. Cut a 1 inch slice, crosswise, from top of
cake. Remove and set aside.

8. Hollow out center of cake leaving 1-inch thick walls on all sides.
Beat cream mixture just until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to
overbeat.

9. Break half of the cake removed from the center into 1/2-inch
chunks. You need about 5 cups. Fold into cream. Spoon into hollow of
cake. Remaining cake scraps are good for snacking.

10. Invert reserved ring of cake so that the top is down; spread
exposed side with raspberry preserves. Place on cake with preserves
down. Cover tightly and refrigerate several hours or overnight. If
desired, frost before serving.

Frosting: In a medium bowl, beat together 1 1-lb box
confectioners'sugar, 1/4 C softened butter or margarine, 3 T
unsweetened cocoa, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 3 to 4 T milk until
smooth. Use to frost cake.
