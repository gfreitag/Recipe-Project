Soak the beans overnight in water to cover.  The next day, drain the
beans. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, add the
wild onions and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add the
garlic, saute 1 more minute, and add the drained beans, salt, pepper,
and 4 cups of the water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce
the heat and simmer, covered, 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to
avaoid burning the beans. Add 4 more cups water and cook, uncovered,
another 30 minutes, again stirring occasionally. Add the remaining 2
cups water and cook 20 minutes, until the beans are soft but still
firm. While the beans are cooking, prepare the tortilla chips.  Stack
the tortillas on a work surface. With a sharp knife, cut the round
tortillas into 3 interlocking triangles. Heat the oil over medium
hihg heat in a skillet until it is very hot but not smoking.
Carefully place each tortilla triangle in the oil; be careful of
splatters. Allow the tortillas to cook 30 seconds and, with a fork,
turn the tortillas over, then repeat the process with the remaining
tortillas. Remove the chips from the oil and dip a corner of each
chip into the blue cornmeal. Place on a paper towel to drain off
excess oil. Garnish the soup with the chips, purple chive blossoms,
and chopped chives. Serve hot with the sour cream on the side. From
