Title: Fried Cucumbers (AI)
Categories: Vegetables, Native amer, Iroquois
Yield: 6 servings
Salt and pepper to season
1 c  Flour
4 lg Cucumbers, washed and cut
-into 1/2 inch slices, cut
-lengthwise
Oil or vegetable shortening for frying

Spread cucumber slices, cut lengthwise, between paper towels to dry.
Let stand for about an hour, Remove towel and season with salt and
pepper. Dip or dust slices and coat both sides lightly. Fry quickly
in hot oil until slices are golden brown on each side. Drain on paper
toweling and serve at once. This is very similar to the Fried Green
Tomato slices and is very tasty. There are so many recipes that are
basically the same, but with the something extra added, gives a
delightful change, as in Baking Powder biscuits, one added
Huckleberries when in season. Sassafras Tea seems to have been a
spring tonic for years ago. Another is Elderberry and Apple jelly
using a cup of each and proceeding in the usual way you make jellies.
