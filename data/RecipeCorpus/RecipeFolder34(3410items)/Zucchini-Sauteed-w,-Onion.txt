.   cups)
1 cl Garlic; pureed
Black pepper to taste
1 lb Zucchini;
Salt to taste
2 tb Butter or olive oil
1 c  Onion; sliced  (up to 1 1/2
Slice off the stems, shave off the other end and scrub the zucchini
under cold running water with a soft vegetable brush.  Using the
large holes of a grater, grate the unpeeled zucchini into a colander.
Toss with 1/2 tsp salt and let stand while preparing the onion.

Heat the butter in a skillet; add the onion and saute, covered, until
tender and translucent but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the
garlic just before the onion is done.

Pack the zucchini into the colander and squeeze or press down hard,
letting the juices fall into a saucepan; reserve the juices.  When
the onions are tender, stir in the zucchini and saute over
medium-high heat, tossing and turning the zucchini several minutes,
until fairly tender. Pour the juices into the skillet and cook a few
minutes more. Season with salt and pepper and serve as a vegetable
side dish. **  Houston Chronicle - Food section - 9 August 1995  **
