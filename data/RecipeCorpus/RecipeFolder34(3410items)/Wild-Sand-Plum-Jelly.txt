"The wild sand plum is

-is excellent for
Pick over the plums and wash them in cold water.  Put plums in an open
kettle with just enough water to cover the second layer of fruit.
Cook over medium heat until the plums are soft and all skins are
split. Pour plums and liquid into a heavy cloth jelly bag or into a
substitute made of flour-sack dish towels.  Let drip overnight or
four about 5 to 6 hours. Do not squeeze the bag, then the juice will
be clear enough to make fine, ruby transparent jelly.  The bag may be
gently squeezed, but if it is, the jelly will be cloudy.  For best
results, do not cook more than 3 to 4 cups of the juice at one time.
Pour the juice into an open saucepan; bring to a rolling boil and
skim if necessary. Add sugar to juice and stir until the sugar is
dissolved. Continue cooking the juice rapidly but not at a rolling
boil. Skim frequently. Cook until a tablespoon of jelly held over the
kettle and slowly poured back into it will leave a thin covering on
the spoon and a heavy drop will cling to the side of the spoon.
Continue cooking until two large drops form separately and cling to
the spoon, then drop slowly back into kettle or cling securely to the
spoon++"  This is the trick part: Pour the hot jelly into sterilized
glasses and seal as for any Jelly. From: Mabel Stewart, Oklahoma
