Fresh mint sprigs
5    Fresh strawberries, halved
-(stems left attached)
Preheat oven from 500'F to 550'F for 30 minutes. Make lengthwise cuts
in strawberry halves, starting 1/4 inch from stem and cutting through
tips. Fan berries. Place bombe on cake pan bottom on heavy large
baking sheet. Bake bombe until meringue browns tightly, watching
carefully, about 4 minutes. Transfer bombe on cake pan bottom to
platter, using 2 large metal spatulas as aid. Arrange 6 fanned berry
halves atop bombe. Arrange remaining 4 berry halves at base of bombe,
spacing evenly. Garnish with mint. Serve immediately, cutting bombe
into slices with hot knife. (If too firm to cut, let stand 5 to 10
minutes.) Transfer to plates. Surround with warm sauce.
