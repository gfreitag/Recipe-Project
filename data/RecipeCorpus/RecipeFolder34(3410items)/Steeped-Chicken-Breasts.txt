Run the tomatoes through an electric juicer or puree them in a food
processor. Stir in 1 to 2 teaspoons of salt, then strain through
cheesecloth (this make take an hour). Stir with a spoon or a whisk,
but do not force the solids through the strainer. You should end up
with 3 to 5 cups of a clear, barely pink, juice. Cut the boneless
chicken breasts into quarters.  In a large skillet with a
tight-fitting cover, pour the strained tomato juice and enough water
to completely cover the chicken breast pieces when submerged. Add the
rosemary sprigs and the garlic cloves.  Bring to a rolling boil. Add
the chicken.  Cover the pan and simmer 3 minutes.  Then turn off the
heat.  Keep the pan tightly covered for 20 minutes more, and the
chicken will steep in the rosemary-garlic broth. After removing the
chicken from the pan, discard the rosemary and garlic, and save and
refrigerate the broth.  It is very good in risotto; or zapped by the
cupful in the microwave and drunk as-is.
