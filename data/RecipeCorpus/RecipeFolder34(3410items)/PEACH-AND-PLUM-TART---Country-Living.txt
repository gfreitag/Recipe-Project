flour, baking powder, and salt just until combined; press into a
ball. Wrap dough and refrigerate 20 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, prepare Almond Filling: In medium-size bowl, with
electric mixer on medium speed, beat almond paste, butter, sugar,
lemon juice, and lemon rind until smooth. Beat in egg and milk. Beat
in flour just until blended.

3. When dough has chilled, heat oven to 375'F. On lightly floured
waxed paper, roll out dough to 13-inch round. Invert dough round onto
12-inch pizza pan; remove waxed paper and press dough into bottom of
pan. Fold excess dough under so that it is even with rim of pan.

4. With fork, pierce bottom of crust in several places and bake 10
minutes. Spread Almond Filling over crust and randomly scatter peach
and plum slices on top. Bake 25 to 30 minutes longer or until crust
