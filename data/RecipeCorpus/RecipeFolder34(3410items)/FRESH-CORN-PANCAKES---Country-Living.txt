1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 lg Egg yolk
2 lg Egg whites

and egg yolk until blended. Stir in flour mixture just until batter
is combined-do not overmix.

3. In small bowl, with electric mixer on high speed, beat egg whites
until soft peaks form. Fold egg whites into pancake batter just until
blended.

4. Heat oven to 200'F. Lightly oil a griddle or large skillet and
heat over medium heat. Ladle about 1/4 C batter onto griddle,
spreading it gently to a 4-inch round. Cook about 2 minutes or until
bubbles form and begin to break on top. Turn pancake over and cook
until bottom is golden brown. Remove pancake and place on a baking
sheet and keep warm in oven. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve
pancakes with butter and warm maple syrup, if desired.
