Title: Scallops Richarde
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 4 servings
4 tb White wine
2 tb Parmesan cheese
1 c  Plain SOFT bread crumbs
3 tb Butter
1 lb Sea scallops
4    Cloves minced garlic
4 tb Butter
2 ts Italian seasoning
Prepare a shallow casserole or gratin dish by buttering (much
preferred) or spraying with butter-flavored spray.  Alternatively, 4
small casseroles or gratin dishes may be used for individual service.

Place scallops (please, don't use bay scallops) in prepared dish(es).
Large scallops may be halved horizontally.  Sprinkle evenly with
butter dots, Italian seasoning, minced garlic, white wine, and
Parmesan cheese.

In a medium skillet or saucepan, sautee the bread brumbs with the 3
TBS butter until light brown.  Sprinkle the crumbs over the scallops.

Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes, until the
breadcrumbs are golden brown and the scallops are hot and bubbly.

Serve immediately.
