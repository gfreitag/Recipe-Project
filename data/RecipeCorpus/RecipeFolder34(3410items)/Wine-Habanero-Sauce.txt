Title: Wine-Habanero Sauce
Categories: Hot/spicy, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 2 cups
1 tb Lemon juice
1/2    Apple, peeled
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Distilled white vinegar
1 tb Lemon juice
3/4 c  White wine
20    Habaneros
1 lg Chipotle in adobo sauce
-or 3 small ones
1    White onion, chopped
2    Garlic cloves, chopped
1 ts Ground cumin
Stem and seed the habaneros, leaving the inner membranes.  Combine the
habaneros with all the other ingredients except the lemon juice and
wine in a blender and process to a fine puree.  Transfer to a
nonreactive pan and cook over low-medium heat for ten minutes.  Add
lemon juice and wine, mix well and transfer to sterilized sauce
bottles.

Keep refrigerated, shake well before use.

I found that this sauce improves over time, apparently as the wine
turns into vinegar.
