Categories: Breads, Canadian
Yield: 2 dozen
1 ts Sugar
1 1/2 c  Water or skim milk
2/3 c  Vegetable oil
3 c  Flour
3 ts Baking powder
1 ts Salt
Mix the dry ingredients together in a bowl. Make a well and add the
liquids. Stir together just until a ball forms and lifts from the
bowl. Do not overmix. Drop by heaping tablespoonfuls onto an
ungreased cookie sheet and bake in a preheated 400 F oven for 10
