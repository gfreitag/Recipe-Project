Title: Sophia Loren's Pizza
Categories: Breads, Italian
Yield: 1 servings
Your favorite toppings --
And spices
1 pk Roll or pizza mix
1/2 c  Yellow corn meal
Olive or vegetable oil
Follow the directions on the box of any packaged roll or pizza mix.
When the dough has risen, knead into it as much yellow corn meal as
it will take. Grease your pizza pan, cookie sheet, or large pie pan
with olive or vegetable oil. Roll out the dough to 1/4~ thickness and
press into the pan. Pour more oil on the top and spread it over the
surface of the dough. Then add the goodies to your own taste:
Anchovies, Cheese, Sliced Ripe Olives, Tomato sauce, Pizza sauce,
sliced Sausages, Mushrooms & season with your favorite spices:
Marjoram, Rosemary, Thyme, or even Oregano. Bake 15-20 minutes in a
hot oven (425~). Cut into wedges and let your guests eat with their
fingers. The world and your tastes will give you your ideas, but I
think you will be happy with my one secret: Yellow corn meal in the
dough.
