3/4 c  Yoghurt
MMMMM------------------------CURRY PASTE-----------------------------
2    Crushed garlic cloves

This is a rich lamb curry of medium strength incorporating almonds and
fresh tomatoes.

It is tradtional to serve curries with either rice or bread. Rice is
good with this dish as it soaks up the rich sauce. Garnish with fresh
tomatoes and fresh coriander.

Keep an eye on the pan and top up the water if necessary. A good
fitting lid helps to prevent steam escaping - to give a better fit
cover the pan with foil before putting on the lid.

1. Make the paste. Dry roast the cumin and coriander seeds with the
coconut and almonds. Place in a blender with the garlic, ginger,
turmeric, chilli powder and 75ml of water (if cooking for 4) and work
to a smooth paste.

2. Heat the oil in a heavy-based saucepan and fry the meat until
brown. Stir in the onions and cook for 3 minutes then stir in the
spicy paste. Continue to cook, stirring until the liquid has
evaporated. Add the yoghut 1 tbls at a time. Cook until the mixture
is dry between each addition.

3. Mix the tomatoes into the pan with 300ml water. Season with salt
and pepper, cover and simmer gently for 1 1/2 hours or until the meat
is tender and the sauce is thick.
