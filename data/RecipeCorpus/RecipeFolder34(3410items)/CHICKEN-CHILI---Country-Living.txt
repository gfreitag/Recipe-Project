1. In 8-quart saucepot, heat chickens, their giblets, and water to
boiling over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover pot and simmer
chickens 40 to 45 minutes or until fork-tender, turning chickens sev-
eral times. Transfer chickens to a bowl to cool, discarding giblets.
Skim fat off broth and discard. Reserve 3 C  broth. (Cool and freeze
leftover broth for soup or other recipes.)

2. In 5-quart kettle, heat oil over me- dium-low heat. Add onions and
saute until soft-about 10 minutes. Stir in jalapenos and garlic;
saute 1 minute. Add flour, pepper, cumin, and salt; stir to combine
mixture well.

3. Stir reserved 3 C broth and green chilies into onion mixture and
heat to boiling, stirring constantly, until thickened. Remove mixture
from heat. Meanwhile, bone and skin chickens. Cut chicken meat into
1/4-inch chunks (about 6 C). Add chicken chunks and beans to
thickened onion mixture. Cool, cover, and refrigerate chili, then
reheat before the skating party. Or to serve chili immediately,
reheat to boiling and simmer 5 minutes, stiffing gently.

4. For each serving, spoon about 2/3 C chili into a Fried Tortilla
Bowl, if desired, and top with lettuce, cheese, and salsa. Or spoon
chili into bowls and serve with warm tortillas or chips.

Fried Tortilla Bowls: In 4-quart saucepan, heat about 1 1/2 quarts or
2 inches vegetable oil to 375'F on deep-fat thermometer. Drop a 7- to
8-inch flour tortilla into hot oil and immediately press center of
tortilla with a metal ladle to form a bowl. Fry tortilla until
golden- about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Drain tortilla bowl upside down on
paper towels. Repeat to fry as many as needed.
