Categories: Newspaper, Scot/irish, Fruit, Breads
Yield: 16 scones
2 ts Lemon zest; grated
1 c  Buttermilk
1 tb Canola oil
1 lg Egg; lightly beaten with
.  1 tbsp water
2 c  Flour; all-purpose
1/4 c  + 1 tbsp sugar; divided
1 ts Baking soda
1 ts Cream of tartar
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 c  Crystallized ginger; chopped
Preheat the oven to 350Ã¸F.  Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat it with
vegetable oil cooking spray.

Sift together the flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar
and salt into a mixing bowl.  Stir in the ginger and lemon zest.  In
a small bowl, combine the buttermilk and oil and add to the dry
ingredients, stirring just until blended.  (The dough will be
slightly sticky.)

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and pat to a
thickness of 1/2-inch.  Using a floured 4-inch round cutter, cut out
the dough.  Cut each circle in half to make half-moons.  Reroll the
remaining dough and cut scraps, handling the dough as little as
possible. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.

Brush the tops with the egg glaze.  Sprinkle with the remaining tbsp
sugar. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the tops are golden and
firm to the touch.  Serve warm.
