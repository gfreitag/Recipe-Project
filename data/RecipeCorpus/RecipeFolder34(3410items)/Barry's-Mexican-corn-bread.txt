Title: Barry's Mexican corn bread
Categories: Breads, Tex/mexican
Yield: 14 slices
2 ts Baking Powder
1/4 ts Baking Soda
1 lg Egg
3/4 c  Water
3 tb Sugar
3 tb Gluten
2 tb Oil
2 ts Yeast
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour  *
2 1/2 c  All purpose flour
1/4 c  Corn meal
1/4 c  Sour cream
2/3 c  Mexican style corn  ***
1/4 c  Juice--from can plus
- water
1/4 c  Pace Picante sauce **
*   It may be necessary to add between 1 and 4 Tbs. of Whole Wheat
flour depending upon the overall moisture content.  Make
determination at end of first kneading.

**  Substitutions can probably be made.  Pace is not as runny as some
brands, and, I like the taste.

*** Plain fresh or canned corn can be substituted, however, mild
Mexican style corn adds to the flavor and presentation.
