Recipe by: smithwe@uvmain.uvsc.edu

Cook chicken in water to cover with 1 bay leaf.  Bring to boil and
cook for 30 min. or until juices run clear. Cool and remove skins.
Or, you can cook chicken in frying pan until cooked through.  Cut
into bite size pieces. Cook noodles and drain. Add all ingredients
and mix well.  I use only about half the bottle of dressing and then
put the rest on the table if someone wants more. Serve warm or cold.
