Title: Savory Flatbread
Categories: Breads, Low cal/fat
Yield: 6 dozen
1 1/2 c  Whole-wheat flour
3 tb Instant minced onion
1 ts Dried rosemary; crushed
1/2 ts Salt
x  Vegetable cooking spray
1 pk Dry yeast
1/4 c  Warm water (105 to 115 deg)
1 c  Warm skim milk (105 to 115)
2 tb Margarine; melted
1 tb Honey
2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour; divided
Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes.
Add warm milk, margarine, and honey; stir well.  Stir in 2 cups
all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, onion, rosemary, and salt to
form a stiff dough.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead until
smooth and elastic (about 7 minutes); add enough of remaining
all-purpose flour to prevent the dough from sticking to hands.  Place
the dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat
top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from
drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

Punch dough down and divide into 4 equal portions, shaping each into
a ball (cover the remaining dough while working to prevent it from
drying out).

Roll 1 ball into a 15- x 12-inch paper-thin rectangle on a baking
sheet coated with cooking spray.  Score the dough by making 2
lengthwise cuts and 5 crosswise cuts to form 18 crakcers.  Prick
entire surface liberally with fork (do not allow to rise).

Bake at 300 degrees F. for 23 minutes or until lightly browned.
Remove from pan; let cool completely on a wire rack.  Separate into
individual rackers. Repeat procedure with remaining dough.  Stor in
an airtight container. Yield:  6 dozen (serving size: 1 cracker).
