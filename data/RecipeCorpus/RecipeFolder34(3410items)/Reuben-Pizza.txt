Or
Spread a pound or more of pizza dough on a pizza pan. Spread Thousand
Island or Russian dressing on top(as you would sauce). Rinse, and
drain 1/2 a package of sauerkraut, and spread on top of pizza. Cut up
corned beef(1/4 to 1/2 pound) into bite size pieces, and spread on
top of pizza. Cover with grated swiss cheese(about 1 1/2 cups), bake
for 20 minutes at 350 degreees. This is definitely the best pizza I
have ever had, and I have never liked sauerkraut!
