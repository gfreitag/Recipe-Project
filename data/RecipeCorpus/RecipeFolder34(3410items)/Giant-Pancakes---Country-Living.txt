To make first batter, in large bowl, combine the above ingredients.
See end of recipe for the rest of the batters.

Heat a nonstick 10 inch skillet over low heat; generously brush with
shortening to coat.  Spoon half of batter into skillet and with a
large pancake turner, spread batter evenly.  Cover skillet and cook
until bottom of pancake is light brown and top surface looks dry -
about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oven to 375F.  With vegetable
shortening, generously grease 11 inch rounds in the centers of 2
baking sheets.

With the pancake turner, loosen pancake; invert onto center of one
greased baking sheet.  Bake pancake 5 minutes or until bottom is
golden brown. Meanwhile, brush skillet with more shortening; add
remaining half of batter and repeat to make second pancake.

When granola pancakes are baked, remove from baking sheets to 2 wire
racks; then prepare Buckwheat Banana Batter into pancakes using same
method. When Buckwheat pancakes are baked, place one on top of each
granola pancake. Repeat to make Cornmeal Blueberry batter into
pancakes; place one on top of each buckwheat pancake.

To assemble Giant Pancake stack, on an ovenproof serving platter,
place one stack of pancakes on top of the other to make six layers.
Place in oven 5 mintues to heat until warm.  To serve, cut into 8
wedges and top with Apricot Cranberry Sauce (see separate recipe).
Serve with Irish bacon and sausage links, if desired.

Buckwheat-Banana Batter:  Prepare Whole Wheat Granola Batter,
substituting 3/4 cup buckwheat flour for the whole-wheat flour and 2
small bananas, sliced, for the granola.

Cornmeal-Blueberry Batter: Prepare Whole-Wheat Granola batter,
substituting 1 cup cornmeal for the whole-wheat flour and 3/4 cup
