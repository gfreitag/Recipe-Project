Title: Lutefish, Norwegian style.
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 1 servings
Salt
Finely ground pepper
Lutefish
Potatoes
Salt pork or bacon
You take the necessary amount of ready made lutefish and cook it
the way you are used to. If there have been used too strong lye under
the production, the lutefish is a bugger to cook. It simply vanishes
if you cook it too hard. You only let it simmer for a short period.
Watch it!
It helps if you use quite a lot of salt in the cooking water.
You can also cook it in the microwave oven.
You also cook the potatoes, the amount is up to you. 3-4 per person
(depends of size of potato).
Fry the sliced pork or bacon. (I prefer it medium done.)
Serve the lutefish together with the pork/bacon and potatoes.
Use fat from the frying on the lutefish and potato..
Add salt and pepper to taste..

Perhaps not the most healty meal, but mmmmmmm.
Lutefish also seems to have a positive effect on the digestion I
think. Submitted By JOSTEIN MORK   On   08-13-95
