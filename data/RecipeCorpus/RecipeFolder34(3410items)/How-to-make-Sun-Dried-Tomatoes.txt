If you've got loads of time. . .slice the tomatos in half, lay them
on a rack like a cake cooling rack, set your oven to 170 degrees, and
let them bake for about 5-6 hours. Check them every hour after that,
taking them out when they're still a bit soft but completely dry
outside. Some of them may take up to 10 hours to dry. These will have
to be reconstituted with boiling water before useor before storing in
olive oil. I just store mine as is in an airtight container in the
fridge. I've also found that I like sundried cherry tomatos better
than sundried romas. The sweetness is much more intense.
