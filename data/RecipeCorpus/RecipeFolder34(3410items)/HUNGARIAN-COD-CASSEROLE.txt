Categories: Fish/seafoo, Hungarian, Casseroles
Yield: 4 servings
4    Potatoes, boiling
3 tb Butter
2 lb Cod or scrod fillet;
-in two long pieces
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
2    Tomato, fresh; skinned,
-peeled & chopped
8 oz Sour cream
4 tb ;Water
2 tb Oil
2 md Onion, yellow; sliced
2    Bell peppers, green; cut
-into 1" cubes
2 tb Hungarian sweet paprika
Grease a 20cm x 25cm (8"x10") baking dish, arrange the fish fillets
down the center and salt and pepper them.  Boil potatoes, peel and
slice, and arrange them on each side of fish.  Sprinkle potatoes with
salt and pepper and dot with butter.

To make sauce: heat and saute onions until golden.  Add green pepper
and stir for one to two minutes; add paprika, stir briefly, and
simmer until vegetables are tender.  Blend in chopped tomatoes,
correct for season- ing, and spread sauce over fish.  Dilute soured
cream with 4 tablespoons water so it is pourable, and lightly salt
it.  Pour over potatoes on each side of fish.  Bake at 190 degrees C.
(400 F.) for 30 to 35 minutes or until top is brown and bubbly.

Note that this recipe works with the very thick and adulterated stuff
sold in the U.S. as sour cream.  If your local equivalent can be
poured, skip the water.

When my parents came to the U.S., my mother, Eve Szent-Gyorgyi, set
about cooking Hungarian food with a minimum of Hungarian ingredients.
Fortunately, as she lived on Cape Cod, good fish was available.
Here's a recipe that proved a favorite of of her dinner guests.
