Preheat the oven to 350.  Grease a 10" bundt pan with butter.  Sift
the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a small
bowl.  Beat the butter, sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon in a medium size
mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until blended,
about 2 minutes.  Stop the mixer once or twice to scrape the bowl
with a rubber spatula.  Add the egg yolks to the butter mixture and
beat on medium speed until blended, about 10 seconds.

Scrape the bowl once during the mixing and again at the end.  The
batter will not be smooth at this point.  Fold in one third of the
dry ingredients with a rubber spatula.  Then fold in half the
buttermilk, another third of the dry ingredients, the remaining
buttermilk and the remaining dry ingredients.  Beat the egg whites in
another medium size mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium high
speed until frothy, about 30 seconds. Gradually add the remaining 3
tbsp sugar and continue beating until the whites form soft peaks,
about 30 seconds more.  Stir one third of the whites into the batter
to loosen it, then fold in the rest of the whites with a rubber
spatula.  Fold in the chocolate chips, grated chocolate and poppy
seeds.  Scoop the batter into the pan and distribute it evenly. Bake
the cake on the center rack until it is golden, about 1 hour. Let the
cake cool completely in the pan.  Sift powdered sugar over the top
before serving.
