1. Several hours or day before serving, prepare Tomato Sauce: In

browned; remove garlic and discard. Add pork and brown on all sides.

stirring occa- sionally, 2 to 3 hours or until sauce has thickened
slightly. Remove pork from sauce and serve with manicott1 or use for
another purpose. Use sauce immediately or cool then refrigerate until
ready to use.

2. Several hours or day before serving, prepare crepes: In large
bowl, stir together eggs, flour, and water until well combined. Coat
bottom of a large skillet with non-stick vegetable cooking spray.
Heat skillet over medium heat. Spoon a scant 1/4 C  batter into
skillet; tip pan to make 6-inch-round crepe. Cook crepe until batter
is set (do not brown)-1 minute. Carefully turn crepe over and cook
other side. Place crepe on plate or board. Repeat with rest of batter
to make more crepe. Crepes can be filled immediately or covered and
refrigerated overnight.

Sauce into bottom of 9-inch-square baking dish and tilt to cover
bottom evenly.

5. Heat oven to 350'F. Spoon 2 tablespoons Cheese Filling into center

shredded mozzarella. Bake manicotti 25 to 30 minutes or until sauce
