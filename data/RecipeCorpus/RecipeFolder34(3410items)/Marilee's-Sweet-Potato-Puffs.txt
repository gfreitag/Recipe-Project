Title: Marilee's Sweet Potato Puffs
Categories: Vegetables, Potatoes
Yield: 6 servings
Corn Flakes -- crushed
Dark Brown Sugar
Dark Corn Syrup
2 cn (18 Oz) Sweet Potatoes,
-Whole And Cut
Flour
Marshmallows, (Large)
1. Preheat the oven to 350 F.

2. Put the sweet potatoes in a large bowl, and drain as much of the
residual liquid from them as possible. Gently mash all pieces
together.

3. Dust your hands with a little flour, and gently
knock off any excess. Take a palmful of sweet potato in one hand, and
place a marshmallow in the center of the mass. Place a second palmful
of sweet potato on top of the first, surrounding the marshmallow
totally. Gently form a "snowball" of sweet potato, then roll it in a
bowl of corn flake crumbs - just enough to get some stuck around the
puff.

4. Place the puffs in a baking dish. Sprinkle about 1 Tbs of brown
sugar on top of each puff, so that it covers the top in a thin layer.
Drizzle 1 to 2 Tbs of corn syrup over the brown sugar and top of each
puff, so that it runs down the sides a bit.

5. Bake for about 20 mins, or until the brown sugar has melted over
the top. Serve hot. Makes 4 to 6 servings.
