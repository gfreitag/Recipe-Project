===================> "Complete Book of Home Freezing" <===============

Do not attempt to freeze a large brick or wheel of cheese without
slicing or cutting it into portions, for cheese has a tendency to
crumble if it is cut while in the frozen state. Repackage cheeses in
sizes sufficient for a day's supply (if cottage cheese) or a week's
(Cheddar). Cheddar and other hard cheeses can be cut into half pound
wedges or sliced for sandwiches. Wrap wedges in plastic film and then
in heavy laminated freezer paper. Be sure to slip double or folded
thicknesses of cellophane between slices before wrapping and freezing
them. Cheddar and other hard cheeses will keep up to six months.

Defrosting should be done in its wrapper, in the refrigerator.

Cheeses that freeze well are Camembert, Port du Salut, Mozarella,
Liederkrantz and Parmesan.

Cheeses with a high fat content (such as Cheddar, Swiss and American
brick, etc.) are best kept at refrigerator temperatures (32 to 40
degrees F/ Zero to 4 C) If you have more than you can use, soon
though, cut it into 1/2 pound (or less) pieces, wrap each piece
tightly, label and freeze.

Plain cream cheese (fatty) mixed with cream for dips, etc. will freeze
satisfactorily.

If the curds of cottage cheese are not washed, it keeps quite well.
This means you can freeze homemade cottage cheese, but not the
commercial kind. But it too, may be combined with other ingredients
in a gelatin salad for freezing.
