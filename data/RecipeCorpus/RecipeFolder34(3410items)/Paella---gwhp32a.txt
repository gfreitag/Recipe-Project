Add clams, mussels, pork and sausages. Cook 10 minutes,or until
liquid is absorbed and rice is tender.Heat the peas and sprinkle them
all over the top. The choice of meats and seafood is yours.The dish
needs the chicken and some types of seafood. This dish originated in
Spain, and was eaten by people of poor means, since seafood and
chicken were inexpensive and readily available. I hope you enjoy this
recipe.  I have several other recipes for Paella, this one is a bit
complex, but well worth the effort!
