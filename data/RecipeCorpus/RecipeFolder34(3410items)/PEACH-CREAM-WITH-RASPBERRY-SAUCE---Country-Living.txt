3 lg Ripe peaches
2 ts Lemon juice
1/3 c  To 1/2 C sugar

and pit peaches. Slice 2 peaches into food processor or blender;
puree. Finely chop remaining peach and toss with lemon juice.

if peaches are tart.) Stir in peach puree; let stand 5 minutes to
soften gelatin. Heat to boiling over medium heat, stirring

chopped peaches and yogurt. Refrigerate, covered, until mixture
mounds slightly when dropped from a spoon-about 45 minutes.

cream with vanilla and almond extracts until soft peaks form; fold
into peach mixture. Pour into oiled mold; refrigerate until set@
hours or overnight.

4. Meanwhile, prepare Raspberry Sauce. To serve, unmold gelatin onto
serving platter; surround with fresh raspberries, if desired. Serve
with Raspberry Sauce.

Raspberry Sauce: In 1-quart saucepan, combine 1 t cornstarch and 1 T
sugar. In food processor with chopping blade, puree 1 10-oz package
frozen raspberries, thawed, and 2 T water until smooth. Strain
raspberries through a sieve into cornstarch mixture, pressing with

mixture to boiling, stirring constantly, until thickened. Cool,
