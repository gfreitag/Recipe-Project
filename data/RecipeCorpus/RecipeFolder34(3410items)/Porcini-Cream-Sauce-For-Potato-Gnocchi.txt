1    Recipe Quick Potato Gnocchi
1/2 oz Dried Porcini Mushrooms --

1 c  Chicken Bouillon
4 tb Unsalted Butter
3/4 c  Heavy Cream
1    Beurre Manie * -- optional
1/4 c  Parmesan Cheese & Additional
* BEURRE MANIE: Process 8 Tbs of softened unsalted butter and 8 Tbs
all-purpose flour in a food processor until smooth. Divide the
mixture into 8 equal parts and, with floured hands, shape each into a
ball. Place the Beurre Manie in a tightly covered jar and refrigerate
for up to 1 week. Beurre Manie can also be frozen for 2 to 3 months.

1. Combine the porcini and bouillon in a saucepan and simmer,
covered, for 20 mins, or until the mushrooms are tender. Drain well,
finely dice, and reserve. Pass the bouillon thru' a double layer of
cheesecloth and reserve.

2. Melt the butter in a heavy skillet over medium-low heat and whisk
constantly until a light hazelnut brown. Immediately add the cream and
reserved mushroom broth and simmer until reduced by one quarter.
Whisk in bits of the optional beurre manie and simmer until the sauce
lightly coats a spoon. Add the porcini and Parmesan and season with
salt and pepper.

3. Add the gnocchi to the skillet and simmer gently until just heated
through. Serve at once with a grating of Parmesan.
