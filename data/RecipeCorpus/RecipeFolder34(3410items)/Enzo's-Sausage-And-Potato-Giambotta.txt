Title: Enzo's Sausage And Potato Giambotta
Categories: Main dish, Meats, Potatoes, Sausage
Yield: 1 servings
-wedges
1/2 c  White wine
1/2 c  Chicken stock
Salt and pepper
Italian seasoning
2 lb Italian sausage -- cut in
-2 in pieces
4 lg Potatoes -- sliced thick
4 lg Bell peppers -- cut in
-wedges
5 md White onions -- cut in
Bake sausage in a pan at 500 degrees for 15 minutes.  Drain well, set
aside. (I simply pan-fried them, took less time.)

In a large ovenproof skillet, place enough olive oil to cover potato
slices. When oil is hot, add potatos and let cook until golden brown
on one side. Turn potatos over and add the peppers and onions. Cook
vegetables only partway so that they are still firm.

Drain oil from skillet, add sausage, wine, stock, salt, pepper and
Italian Seasoning to taste.  Toss lightly.

Place skillet in 400 degree oven for 20 minutes.  Serve at once.
