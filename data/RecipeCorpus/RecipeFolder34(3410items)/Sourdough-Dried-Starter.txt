Hi - Dried starter isn't WAY OUT!  I dry sourdough starter in a dish
over wax paper, 1/4 inch deep, for about 10 days till it gets
brittle, break it up, grind it in a blender, food processor, or
coffee grinder till a powder and store it.  About 1 tablespoon full
in 1/2 cup warm water and 1/2 cup flour all mixed together and sit in
a warm place (the oven with the light left on is 85 degrees) for a
day or two and IT'S ALIVE!. Should work with your amish starter also.
