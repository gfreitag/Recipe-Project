Categories: Country liv, Fruit, Desserts
Yield: 6 servings
1 pt Basket strawberries, hulled
Pesticide-free strawberry
-blossoms with leaves or
-fresh mint sprigs (opt.)
6 md (about 2 lb) ripe peaches
1 cn (12-oz) no-sugar-added
-frozen cranberry-raspberry
-juice concentrate, thawed
-(see Note)
1. In 3-quart saucepan, heat 2 inches water to boiling. Dip peaches,
half at a time, into boiling water then plunge into bowl of cold
water. Repeat with remaining peaches.

2. Peel peaches. In large bowl, combine peaches and thawed undiluted
juice concentrate. Stir in strawberries; cover and refrigerate 30
minutes to marinate the fruit.

3. Just before serving, transfer fruit and their syrup to compote
dish or individual rimmed serving dishes. Garnish with strawberry
blossoms and leaves, if desired. Serve with fruit knives and forks.

Note: Cranberry juice in its natural state would be almost as tart as
lemon juice. For this reason, it is made into a drink mixture
composed of cranberry juice, sweeteners, and sometimes other juices.
The no-sugar concentrate we chose for this recipe is sweetened with
asparatame, thus no sugar is added. If you wish to substitute regular
sweetened cranberry-juice cocktail concentrate, it will add 97
calories per serving.
