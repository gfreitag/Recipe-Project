Title: Mashed French Beans With Garlic And Mint
Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 ts Kosher Salt -- more to
-taste
4 tb Olive Oil, Extra-Virgin
2 tb Fresh Mint -- chopped
Black Pepper -- freshly
-ground
1 c  Flageolet Beans
1    Head Garlic
1    Celery Rib
1    Carrot, Scrub & Cut In Half
-Lengthwise
1 md Onion -- peeled and halved
1. Soak the beans, covered with cold water, overnight. Discard any
beans or loose skins that float to the surface.

2. Preheat the oven to 375 F.

3. Place the head of garlic in an ovenproof dish and roast in the oven
until completely tender, about 30 to 40 mins. Cool, slice off the top
1/4 inch from the pointed end and squeeze the softened garlic cloves
from their papery skins. They will now have the consistency of a
puree. Set aside.

4. Place the beans in a medium saucepan and cover generously with
water. Add the celery, carrot, and onion. Bring to a boil, reduce the
heat, cover, and simmer 1 hour. Add salt and continue cooking for an
additional 30 mins, or until tender.

5. Drain the beans, reserving the liquid and discarding the
vegetables. Puree the beans, adding 1/2 cup and perhaps a few Tbs
more of their cooking liquid. The beans will resemble mashed potatoes
but will not be completely smooth.

6. Heat a skillet with 3 Tbs of olive oil over a medium flame. Saute
the roast garlic puree for 1 min. Add the pureed beans and stir to
heat through and incorporate the garlic. Finish with the chopped
mint, salt, and freshly ground pepper. Drizzle the remaining olive
oil on top and serve.
