Title: Unbelievably Good Garlic Soup
Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetables
Yield: 2 servings
-cut into bits
2 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Ground Cumin
Salt And Pepper -- to taste
Chopped Fresh Parsley --
-as garnish
2 md Onions -- chopped
1    Head Garlic, Cloves
-Separated & Peeled
3 tb Olive Oil
1 c  Chicken Stock
1 c  Cream Or Half-And-Half
Day-Old French Bread --
1. In a large skillet, over a medium heat, saute the onions and
garlic in the olive oil until the onions are translucent, about 5
mins.

2. Transfer the sauteed mixture to a blender or food processor and
blend until smooth. Add the chicken stock and continue to blend; then
add the cream and blend well. If you have an adjustable-speed
processor, you might find the mixture staying smoother on a slower
blending speed, you don't want to froth the cream.

3. Add small bits of the French bread slowly, so the soup begins to
thicken up as the bread is incorporated into the liquid. The amount of
bread you add is going to determine the thickness of the soup. If you
want a thick, almost stewlike consistency, add more bread. If you
want a thinner soup, add less.

4. Once you have the texture you want, transfer the mixture to a
saucepan over medium heat. Add the paprika and cumin, and salt and
pepper to taste. Simmer for 5 to 8 mins. Sprinkle with parsley and
serve hot. Makes 2 servings.
