Title: Garnishing A Leek Flower
Categories: Information, Vegetables
Yield: 1 servings  1.  To make the leek flower, select leeks which are about 1 inch in
diameter at the base.  Cut the roots off and wash the leek.  Where the
roots and layers of the vegetable meet there is a thick base like
that on the bottom of a celery stalk.  Slice through this thick base
but do not cut it off completely.

2.  Use a small sharp knife and make a downward cut from the root end
of the vegetable.  Make this cut straight down, cutting through all
of the layers of the onion from the center of the onion.

3.  Continue cutting aruond the outside of the leek until you have
strips all around.

4.  Put a toothpick into the end of the leek and twirl the vegetable
to open the petals.  Chill the flower in ice water for 5 minutes to
open the petals further.  To color the flowers, put a few drops of
food coloring into the ice water.  This is the same type of flower as
made from the scallion but larger in size.
