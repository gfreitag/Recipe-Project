1 c  Vegetable oil

Soak the beans overnight in enough water to cover.  The following day,
drain the beans, rinse under cold running water, and place in a pot
with fresh water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then
reduce heat and simmer for several hours until the beans are soft.
Remove from heat and drain.  Mash the beans and mix with butter and
cornmeal. Set aside. Bring the 2 cups of water to a boil over high
heat.  Add the bean mixture, salt, pepper, chile powder and cumin.
Reduce the heat and simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to
prevent burning.  Pour into a greased 5-X-9 inch loaf pan, cool to
room temperature, and chill in the refrigerator overnight or until
firm.  Unmold from the loaf pan, cut into approximately 1/2 inch
slices, and set on a cookie sheet. Reheat in a 350 degree F. oven for
10 minutes, until warm. For the Brown Herb Sauce, bring the stock to
a boil in a large saucepan over moderate heat. Add the butter ands
tir until completely melted.  Add the tarragon, chives, dill and
basil, stir 1 minutes, and remove from the heat. Cut the tortillas
into feather shapes with scissors or a small paring knife. In a
skillet over moderate to high heat, heat the oil until it almost
reaches the smoking point. Using two forks, dip each tortilla feather
into the hot oil, remove and blot with a paper towel. Spoon some
Brown Herb Sauce onto each plate and place 2 slices of the Indian
Bean Terrine in the center. Garnish with a Blue Cornmeal Tortilla
Feather and a whole chive, and sprigs of fresh chervil.
