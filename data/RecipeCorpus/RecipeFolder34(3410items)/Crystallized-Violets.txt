Title: Crystallized Violets
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 1 batch
White superfine granulated

Fresh, perfect violet

1    Egg white
Gather violet flowers.  Rinse them carefully, pat dry and place on
paper towels.

Beat egg white until frothy but not stiff.  Dip each flower in egg
white and shake gently to remove excess.  Sprinkle with sugar all
over the flower, coating the back as well as the front.  Place on a
shallow tray lined with waxed paper.  Dry in the refrigerator for one
to two days. Store for as long as a month in airtight containers
layered with waxed paper and placed in a cool, dry location.

Use to garnish cakes, ice cream, fruit salads, pies, and so on.
