Roll dough on a floured surface to about 1/4- inch thick. Cut out 1
dozen sheep with a 4-inch cookie cutter or 1 dozen rabbits with a
5-inch cookie cutter. Shapes can also be traced, or drawn freehand
onto cardboard. Cut out cardboard pattern and use for cutting out
shapes on dough. Bake on parchment-lined cookie sheets in a preheated
375' oven for 10 to 15 minutes. Cool cookies on wire racks.

Divide icing into individual bowls, tint with desired colors and keep
covered when not in use.

Paint cookies: Icing should be the consistency of Elmer's glue. If
icing is too thick, add a small amount of egg white or water. Paint
cookie areas using small paint brushes just to the edge of the
cookie. Dry cookies overnight.

Outline cookies; Tint 1 C royal icing with black or other paste
coloring. Icing should be thick but flow easily from a pastry bag. If
icing is too thin, add a small amount of confectioners' sugar. Fit a
small pastry bag with a #2 decorative tip and pipe outline around
painted areas. Allow icing to dry fully overnight before storing.
