TO COOK and SERVE:
following the nabe procedure described in the "Sukiyaki" recipe,
place the cooking pot of your choice on the dining table.  Pour in
the 6 cups of cold water, add the square of kombu, and bring to a
boil.
Drop in the tofu and simmer gently for 2 to 3 minutes--if cooked too
rapidly or too long, the tofu will harden.
Scoop the tofu out of the broth with a slotted spatula or spoon and
place individual bowls.  Ladle a little of the broth into each bowl,
and serve with the dipping sauce and garnishes.
