Cumin as well.  It does add
-a distinctive flavor.
-After the
Beans are done, heat a deep
-iron skillet with lard.
-When
Smoking, add beans.  Mash
-with an old fashioned
-potato masher,
The ones that look like a
-German hand grenade.  If
-you do not
Have one, use a peanut
-butter jar with a metal
-lid.  Turn upside
Down and pretend it's an
-old fashioned masher.  It
-works
Marvelously well in a
-pinch.  Mash the beans
-until they begin to
Peel away from the skillet
-on their own and are
-smooth in
Really, I don't think most
-people make their own
-refried
Beans from scratch, but
-have you priced cans of
-them lately?
Whew!! We make them up in
-4-5 pound batches and
-freeze them.
Cook 4 or five pounds of
-pinto or red beans until
-very
Tender. Then add salt to
-taste and good ol' lard.
-I will put in
Maybe four or five heaping
-tablespoons full.  Let the
-batch
Simmer for a while until a
-taste test tells you that
-the flavors
Are blended.  Some people
-like to ad about a
-teaspoon of ground
texture.  Then they are done. Serve with a thin slice of mild cheddar
or colby on top of each serving.  The cheese will begin to melt and
string. Yum!  Ain't kosher, but it's good! We freeze the cooked beans
without mashing them and do that part when we make a new batch.
