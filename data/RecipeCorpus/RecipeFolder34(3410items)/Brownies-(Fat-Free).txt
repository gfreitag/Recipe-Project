Folks--your guess is as good as mine as to how, exactly, to make
these, as well as the number of servings (I took a stab at it).

Was downloading my packet yesterday, when I heard them talking about
this recipe on the TV and quickly ran for paper & pencil.  There were
no real clear directions given (or I missed them) so you're on your
own!

Cook the dates and water in a microwave for 5 minutes.  Stir. Pour
mixture into a "greased 13 x 9 pan" and bake for 15-20minutes at 375
degrees.

That's all I heard. I also don't know exactly how many servings, but
they clearly said each brownie was only 110 calories and 0.5g fat.
