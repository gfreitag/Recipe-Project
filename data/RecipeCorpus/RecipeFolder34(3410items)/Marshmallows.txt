Title: Marshmallows
Categories: Candies
Yield: 60 pieces
1/4 ts Salt
1 c  Cold water
1 ts Vanilla extract
1/4 c  Powdered sugar
3 tb Cornstarch
2 c  Granulated sugar
3    Envelopes unflavored gelatin
Butter a 9x13-inch baking pan.  Mix together powdered sugar and
cornstarch in a small bowl.  Coat buttered pan with 1/3 of the sugar
mixture, shaking to cover sides as well as the bottom of the pan.

In a saucepan, combine granulated sugar, gelatin and salt.  Stir in
the cold water and let stand for 5 minutes, until gelatin softens.
Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves.  Do
not boil. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.  Transfer
mixture to electric mixer bowl.  Add vanilla, then beat at high speed
until mixture is thickened and forms soft peaks (about 10 to 15
minutes).

Pour mixture into prepared pan, spreading evenly.  Dust top with half
of remaining powdered sugar mixture.  Cover loosely and let stand at
room temperature for 2-8 hours.  Remove from pan and cut into 1-inch
squares or other shapes.  (Dip knife or cutter in cold water to
prevent sticking.) Roll marshmallows in remaining powdered sugar
mixture. Store in an air-tight container at room temperature up to 2
months.
