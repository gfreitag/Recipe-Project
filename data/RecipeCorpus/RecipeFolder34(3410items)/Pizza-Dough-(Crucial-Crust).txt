Title: Pizza Dough (Crucial Crust)
Categories: Pizza
Yield: 1 12-15" pie
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Whole-wheat flour
3/4 c  Unbleached white flour
1/4 c  Lukewarm water
2 ts Active dry yeast
1/4 c  Whole-wheat flour
1/2 c  Lukewarm water
Combine the first three ingredients in a large mixing bowl.  Cover
with a cloth and let stand for 30 minutes.  Stirring continuously,
add the remaining ingredients, one at a time.

Lightly flour a flat surface and knead the dough for 10 to 15 minutes,
adding just enough additional flour to your hands and the surface to
keep the dough from sticking.

Form the dough into a ball and turn it in a lightly oiled bowl to coat
evenly.  Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and set aside while the
dough rises.  After 2 hours, punch the dough down and knead for
another 2 minutes.  Re-form into a ball, and allow to rise for
another 40 minutes in the covered bowl.

At this point, you can freeze the dough for up to 6 months--it will
need about 2 hours to defrost to a workable consistency--or you can
roll out the pie, pile on your toppings and bake the pizza.

To roll out, lightly flour a flat surface and, using a rolling pin or
just stretching and pushing with your fingers (the more traditional
method), press the dough out into a circle 12 to 15 minches in
diameter, forming a ridge around the edge.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees and then, with the topping of your
choice in place, bake for 20 to 30 minutes on a baking sheet or on a
preheated pizza stone.
