Title: Phyllo Honey Triangles
Categories: Israeli, Desserts
Yield: 12 triangles
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
4 oz Butter (100 g)
1 pk Phyllo pastry dough
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
9 oz Nuts (250 g)
3 tb Honey
12 oz Dried figs (350 g)
1 c  Cognac
MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
3 tb Water
1 c  Honey
3 tb Lemon juice
Soak the figs in cognac for 1/2 hour. Drain and chop. Chop the nuts,
and mix well with the figs and 3 tablespoons honey.

In a small pan, heat the butter until just melted. Don't boil.

Cut a 3" strip off the rolled phyllo dough. Cover the remainder with a
towel and roll out the cut strip.

Remove 2 pieces of the cut dough at a time and place on the cutting
board. Brush both pieces with melted butter, then place one piece on
top of the other. Place about a teaspoon of the fig-nut mixture in
the lower right hand corner of the phyllo.

Fold the phyllo into a small triangle, much like a flag is folded,
from corner to corner.

Place the triangles on a baking sheet, brush the top with melted
butter. Repeat the process until all the phyllo has been used.

Bake in a 420 F (220 C) oven until the triangles are just golden,
about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat the syrup ingredients until the syrup is thickened
and just boils, and remove the pan from the heat.

Remove the baking sheet from oven, cool slightly and then remove the
triangles from baking sheet.  Soak each triangle completely in the hot
syrup.

Serve warm or at room temperature (can be made one day ahead).
