A member of the same family as sharks, skate have no bones  their
skeleton is comprised of cartilage. The pectoral fins, the wing-like
sections that protrude on each side of the body, are the only edible
portion of skate. The wings are removed form the fish and iced
immediately after landing. The flesh should be pearly white and
translucent with hues of pale pink.

Like shark, skate carry a natural metabolic product called urea in
their flesh. If skate are not iced soon after landing, the harmless
urea will impart a strong odor of ammonia - a clear sign of poor
handling. If a slight ammonia smell exists, it can be removed by
soaking the skate in water mixed with lemon for 30 minutes.

Each wing consists of two separate meaty layers of flesh separated by
a layer of cartilage. Whole wings weigh from one-third to three
pounds and yield about 65% of their weight in meat. Skate is
available both frozen and fresh, most commonly in the form of whole,
skinless wings and sections of wings.

This mildly flavorful fish seems to gain its delicious shellfish-like
sweetness from its diet of clams, mussels and other mollusks. Because
the flesh has no bones there are no bones to pick out when preparing
or eating skate.

One 3 ounce serving has 35 calories, 1 gram of fat, 21 mg of protein
and 90 mg of sodium. Figures are not available for cholesterol and
omega-3 fatty acids.

The cartilage dividing skate wings helps hold the flesh together as it
cooks. Skate should be cooked with the flesh still attached to the
cartilage. After cooking, the delicate, easy-to-flake-flesh is readily
removed. Commonly poached and steamed, skate can also be pan-fried,
broiled and grilled with delicious results. The delicate flavor of
skate lends itself well to lively flavor from capers, lemon, toasted
nuts, ginger and fresh herbs.
