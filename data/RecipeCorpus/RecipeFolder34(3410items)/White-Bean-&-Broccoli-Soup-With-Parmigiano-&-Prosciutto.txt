1. Soak the beans in water overnight or for at least 6 hours.

2. Make an herb bundle: In a small piece of clean cheesecloth, place
the coriander seeds, peppercorns, thyme, parsley, and bay leaf. Close
the bundle by tying with a piece of kitchen twine.

3. Melt the butter over a medium flame in a 3-qt saucepan; add the
onions, celery, leeks, and garlic. Cook for 10 mins., until the
vegetables are softened but not browned. Add the herb bundle, beans,
and 8 cups of water.

4. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and gently simmer, covered, for 1
1/2 hours. Season with the salt and cook for an additional 30 mins,
or until the beans are tender.

5. Discard the herb bundle, add the prosciutto and the broccoli, and
simmer 3 to 5 mins, until cooked. Just before serving, stir in the
balsamic vinegar and season with freshly ground black pepper to your
taste. Pour the soup into warm bowls and garnish with the grated
Parigiano.
