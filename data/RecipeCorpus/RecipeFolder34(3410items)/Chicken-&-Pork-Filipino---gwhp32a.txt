Categories: Filipino, Poultry, Meats, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
1    Bay leaf
1 c  Coconut milk
Oil
Water
2 lb Pork; cubed
1 c  Vinegar
1 ts Peppercorns
2 c  Garlic
3 1/2 lb Fryer
Notes:  Chicken should be cut into 2" pieces.  I generally use
breasts and thighs instead of a whole chicken, because of the ease of
preparing. Garlic should be minced.  Method for coconut milk follows
recipe, but this product is availabe in some large markets or
specialty food stores. Preparation: Combine pork, vinegar, garlic,
pepper, and bay leaf. Add 1 cup water, cover and cook slowly for 1
hour.  Add chicken and cook for 30 minutes longer, adding more water
as needed. When pork and chicken are tender remove pieces from liquid
and fry in oil until brown. Return to liquid, add coconut milk and
salt to taste. Simmer for 5 minutes. Variations: add pineapple and
tomatoes or squid, or bamboo shoots, and shrimp. Coconut milk: 2 c.
shredded coconut 1 cup scalded milk Bring milk just to the verge of a
boil, do not allow to boil.  Pour over the coconut.
Squeeze through a cheesecloth.  Add more milk if desired.
