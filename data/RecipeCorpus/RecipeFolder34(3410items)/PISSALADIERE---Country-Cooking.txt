Yield: 6 servings
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
3/4 c  Very warm water (120'F
-to 130'F)
1 tb Olive oil
1 tb Honey
1 1/2    To 2 C  unsifted all-purpose
-flour
1 pk Rapid-rising dry yeast
1 ts Salt
MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
10    Oil-cured, ripe olives,
-pitted and coarsely chopped
1 ts Fresh thyme leaves
1/4 c  Olive oil
1 lg Onion, thinly sliced
5    Plum tomatoes, thinly sliced
1. Prepare Dough: In medium-size bowl, combine 1 C flour, the yeast,
and salt; stir in warm water, oil, and honey. Stir until well blended.

2. Beat mixture vigorously with electric mixer or by hand with wooden
spoon, 10 minutes. Stir in 1/2 C more flour; continue to beat until
blended. Dough should feel moist but not sticky.

3. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead dough, adding
remaining flour if necessary, until smooth and very elastic-about 8
minutes.

4. Wash, dry, and lightly oil mixing bowl. Place dough in oiled bowl,
turning to bring oiled side up. Cover with clean cloth; let dough
rise in warm place until double in size-about 35 to 40 minutes.

5. Meanwhile, prepare Topping: Heat 1 T oil in skillet; add onion and
cook over low heat 20 minutes or until golden and soft. Set aside.
Grease bottom and sides of a 13 by 9-inch baking pan with 2 T oil.
When dough has doubled, roll out to 14 by 10-inch rectangle. Line pan
with dough, allowing 1/2 inch of dough to come up sides. Let dough
rise 30 minutes.

6. Heat oven to 400'F. Top dough with tomato slices, arranged in rows,
leaving a 1/2-inch border of dough uncovered. Spread onions evenly
over tomatoes, drizzle remaining tablespoon olive oil over all, and
bake 15 to 20 minutes or until crust is browned. Top with olives and
thyme.
