Recipe by: The Canadian Living Cookbook

In large bag, mix together flour, 1tsp salt and pepper.  Shake
oxtails, a few at a time, until evenly coated. Set aside any leftover
flour mixture.

In large flameproof casserole or Dutch oven, melt shortening over
medium-high heat.  Brown oxtails completely, adding more shortening
if pan

looks dry.  Set aside as they brown.  Add onions to pan and cook until
softened.  Drain off any excess fat. Stir in boiling water, bouillon
cubes

and bay leaf; return oxtails to pan.  Cover and bake in 325 F (160 C)
oven

for 2-1/2 to 3 hours or until oxtails are tender.  (If oxtails are
fatty, prepare recipe to this point.  Cool and refrigerate overnight;
remove fat before continuing.) Add carrots, potatoes, rutabaga,
celery and remaining salt to stew. Cover and bake for about 45
minutes longer or until vegetables are tender and stew is heated
through.  If desired, thicken stew with 2 tbsp of reserved seasoned
flour blended with cold water.  Stir

into stew and heat to boiling, stirring constantly.
