1. Preheat the oven to 325 F,

2. Season the pork loin with half the salt and pepper. In a small
bowl, combine 1 Tbs of the rosemary and a quarter of the garlic
slices. Insert the misture into the notches between the bones.

3. In a Dutch oven or ovenproof skillet, heat the olive oil over
medium-high heat. Sear the pork loin on all sides until golden brown,
about 10 mins. Transfer to a plate.

4. Add the remaining garlic and rosemary to the pan and cook over a
medium flame until softened but not browned, about 1 min. Stir in the
onions and cook 3 to 4 mins. Pour in the white wine and reduce until
syrupy. Add the veal stock and remaining salt and pepper and bring to
a simmer.

5. Place the pork loin in the pan with bones facing up. Cover tightly
and cook for 1 hour.

6. Remove the cover and turn the roast over. Increase the oven
temperature to 500 F and cook an additional 25 to 30 mins, to brown
the pork.

7. Remove the roast from the pan and set asside, covered, in a warm
spot. Over high heat, reduce the pan juices by half. Transfer the
roast to a cutting board and, using the notches as a guide, carve
into 4 double chops. Serve with the sauce.
