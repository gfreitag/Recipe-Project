Categories: Poultry, Appetizers
Yield: 9 servings
1/2 c  Butter
1/4 c  Pinenuts
9    Walnut halves
Fresh cilantro
Cherry tomato halves,
Optional
Fresh basil, optional
1 tb Finely chopped shallots
1 cl Garlic, minced
1 tb Olive oil
1/2 c  Chopped cooked chicken
5 1/2 oz To 6 chevre or cream cheese,
Cut up
Cilantro pasta dough
(separate recipe)
Cook shallots and garlic in olive oil in a small saucepan until
shallots are tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in chicken and
cheese. Set mixture aside.

Roll half the cilantro pasta dough at a time on alightly floured
board into a 13" circle about 1/16" thick. Let stand 20 minutes. With
a 3" round cutter, cut 36 circles (reroll scraps if necessary to get
36 circles). Place about 1 tablespoon chicken mixture in the center
half of the circles. Lightly brush water around the edges. Top each
with a plain circle pressing edges together to seal. Let stand a few
minutes.

Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a large pot. Add ravioli slowly
enough to maintain the boil. Boil until al dente, about 8 minutes.
Drain immediately.

Meanwhile, cook butter, pine nuts and walnuts until butter is lightly
browned. For each serving, place 2 or 3 ravioli on a small plate.
Spoon the butter sauce over giving each serving a walnut half and
some pine nuts. Garnish with cilantro sprigs and if desired, cherry
tomato halves and fresh basil. Makes 6 or 9 servings.
