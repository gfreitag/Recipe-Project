cook 8 minutes or until reduced to 1/2 cup. Remove from heat; set
broth aside and keep warm.

Place 1 sprig thyme in the center of a 10" square of aluminum foil.
Place 1 fish on top of thyme. Sprinkle fish cavaties with remaining
salt and pepper. Stuff 1/2 cup rice mixture into cavaties of fish.
Wrap fish in foil, twisting the ends to seal.

Prepare grill and place the foil wrapped fish on grill rack; grill 10
minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Unwrap
fish; remove and discard skin. Set the fish aside and keep warm.

Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add remaining
leek and saute 2 minutes or until tender. Divide leek evenly among
four serving plates and top with fish. Drizzle 2 tablespoons broth
evenly over each fish and sprinkle with parsley. Garnish with
additional thyme sprigs if desired.
