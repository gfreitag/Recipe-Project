1 c  Light Cream Or Top Milk;
-Divided
1/2 ts Vanilla Extract
3/4 c  Granulated Sugar
1/8 ts Salt
1/2 c  White Corn Syrup

Divide the light cream or top milk into half cups.  Since this is an
old recipe, Half and Half is what they are talking about.

Combine the first 4 ingredients and 1/2 cup of half and half.  Cook
over low heat to 250 degrees F. on the candy thermometer, or until a
little of the mixture forms a hard ball in cold water.  Add the other
half cup of half and half and cook to 216 degrees F. or until a
little of the mixture forms a thread when dropped from a spoon.  Add
the vanilla. Serve over chocolate ice cream, cream puffs, or cottage
bread puddings.
