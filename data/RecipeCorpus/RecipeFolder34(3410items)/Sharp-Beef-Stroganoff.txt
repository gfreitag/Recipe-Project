Peel and chop the onions and put in 1/3rd of the oil in a large
non-stick pan and heat slowly until the onions are softened. Remove
them with a draining spoon and keep warm. Cut the meat into thin
strips and add to the pan with the remaining oil. Fry quickly until
sealed. Add the onions, beef stock, worcestershire sauce and the
nutmeg and season to taste. Simmer gently, covered, for 45 minutes.
Add the mushrooms and simmer for a further 15 minutes. Blend the
cornflour with a little water and add it to the pan. Boil until just
thickened, remove from the heat and stir in the yoghurt. Transfer to
a serving dish and sprinkle with paprika pepper. Submitted By KAZ
