Title: Potted Shrimp
Categories: Fish/seafoo
Yield: 8 servings
Pinch of nutmeg
Pinch ground mace
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
Salt & pepper
1 lb Fairly small shrimp, shells
On
1 c  Butter
2 ts Fresh lemon juice
1) Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Toss the shrimp and, 1
minute later, start tasting them; they'll cook very quickly. Drain
them immediately and peel when they are cool. Cut them into little
bite- size pieces.

2) Melt 1/2 c of the butter over medium heat; stir in the shrimp,
lemon juice, nutmeg, mace, cayenne, salt and pepper, and turn off the
heat. Divide the shrimp among small bowls or place in a nice crock.

3) Melt the remaining butter over very low heat. Skim the foam off
the top, then carefully pour the clarified butter over the shrimp,
leaving the butter solids in the pan. Refrigerate immediately.

4) Served chilled or slightly warmed as a spread ( Traditionally
served on brown bread. )
