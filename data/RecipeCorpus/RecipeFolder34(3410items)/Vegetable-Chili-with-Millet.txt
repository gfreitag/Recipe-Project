and set aside. Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. When
hot but not smoking, add onions, garlic, bell pepper, jalapeno.
Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until onions
turn translucent - about 9 minutes. Add reserved beans, 2 cups water,
tomatoes, tomato sauce, spices and oregano. Mix well and bring to
boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cook, partially covered, 1-1/2

cooking until millet and beans are cooked through but not mushy, the
flavors have mellowed and chili is rich and aromatic - at least 2

of pan. Salt to taste. To serve, lade the chili into warmed bowls,
and either top with yogurt, scallions and oranges or pass them
seperately.
