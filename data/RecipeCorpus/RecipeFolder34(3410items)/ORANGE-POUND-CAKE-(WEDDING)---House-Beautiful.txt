sizes: 12-inch, 8-inch, and 5-inch (all 3 inches deep) and set aside.

light and pale yellow, Beat in the eggs, orange zest and extracts.
Slowly add the flour, baking soda and salt, incorporating fully after
each addition. Mix in the concentrate and sour cream. Scrape the
sides of the bowl and mix to smooth out any lumps.

Divide mixture into prepared pans so that each is equally full. Bake
in a preheated 325' oven for 30 to 45 minutes or until cakes pull
away from the sides of the pans and cake tester comes out clean.
Check cakes after 30 minutes. (Do not let pans touch each other or
the sides of the oven. It is important not to overcrowd the oven.
Unbaked cake layers can sit at room temperature until oven space is
available.) Remove cakes from oven and allow them to cool in their
pans on a wire rack.

Baked cooled cakes can be wrapped in their pans and refrigerated up
to one week, or frozen.
