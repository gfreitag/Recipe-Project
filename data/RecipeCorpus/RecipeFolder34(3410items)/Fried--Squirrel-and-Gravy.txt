Categories: Game
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Crisco; for frying
Milk; for gravy
1    Squirrel; cut into 7 pieces
1 c  Flour; seasoned with
1/2 ts Each salt and pepper
Recipe by: Pansy Hitchcock as remembered by Bright Larkin Put seasoned
flour into small paper bag.  Put squirrel, one or two pieces at a
time into bag and shake to coat with flour.  Meanwhile melt crisco in
cast-iron skillet.  Put squirrel pieces into pan and brown on both
sides. Reduce heat, cover skillet, and cook for about 20 minutes, or
until done. Pour off about half the fat.  Stir in flour from the bag
until you have a very thin roux, or put about 2 Tbs. of the flour
into a jar with a tight-fitting lid and add milk, then put on the lid
and shake until the flour is dissolved and all the lumps have gone.
Make sure you scrape up all the brown bits from the bottom of the
pan. Add milk, stirring, and bring to a boil. If the gravy is too
thick, add more milk. If it is too thin add more flour and milk
mixture and reheat to a boil. Submitted By BOBBI ZEE   On   08-30-95
