Categories: Pasta/rice, Potatoes
Yield: 5 servings
Black Pepper -- freshly
-ground
pn Nutmeg, Freshly Grated --
-optional
1 lb All-Purpose Potatoes, Peeled
-cut into eighths
1 1/2    Extra-Large Egg Yolks
3/4 c  All-Purpose Flour
Salt
1. Drop the potatoes into boiling salted water and cook until very
tender. Drain and pass thru' a food mill or potato ricer into a large
bowl. While still warm, add the yolks and flour, season with salt and
pepper and the optional nutmeg, and mix well. Transfer to a lightly
floured surface and knead quickly into a smooth ball; the dough will
be slightly moist. Roll quickly with floured hands into
1/2-inch-thick logs, and cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Set aside.

2. Set a pan of ice water near the stove top. Drop the gnocchi a few
at a time into a large pot of boiling salted water and cook just
until they rise to the surface. Remove immediately with a slotted
spoon and plunge into the bowl of ice water. When completely cool,
drain well on kitchen towels, cover, and refrigerate until needed.

NOTE: This recipe came from Michael Romano of Union Square Cafe. They
are quick and easy to make and can be made ahead and  refrigerated or
even frozen and then thawed in the micro for hurry-up meals. A
further note from the author; You must cook the gnocchi immediately
after making the dough because the dough becomes much more soft and
moist upon standing and thus very difficult to handle. On the other
hand, once cooked, the gnocchi will keep covered in the refrigerator
for up to 1 week. To freeze, place the gnocchi on a baking sheet in
the freezer until completely frozen. Transfer to plastic bags and
store in the freezer for up to 1 month.
