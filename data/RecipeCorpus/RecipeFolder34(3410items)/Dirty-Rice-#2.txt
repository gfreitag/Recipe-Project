**   A Cajun spice made from dried sassafras leaves, sometimes mixed
with thyme.

In a dry skillet, brown the flour, stirring constantly, until light
brown in color.  In a separate skillet, saute the onion, celery and
bell pepper in 3 tablespoons of oil for 10 minutes, stirring
constantly. Add to the flour and mix well.

Brown the mushrooms in three teaspoons of oil.  Add the textured
vegetable protein and brown well with the mushrooms for 10 minutes.
Add the onion and flour mixture and saute for another 10 mintues.

Add the water and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring often.  The mixture
should be fairly thick and the textured vegetable protein should be
tender and chewy.  If it's not tender, add more water, 1/4 cup at a
time.

Add the remaining ingredients, mix well and serve.  Serves 6.
