Categories: Pizza, Aust/german
Yield: 4 servings

4 15/16 ml (level) ground nutmeg
125 ml Sour cream (1/2 cup plus
-1/2 Tbsp)
1    Egg

150 g  Butter (2/3 cup)
250 g  Flour (2 cups plus 3 1/2

50 g  Butter (3 1/2 Tbsp)
Topping:
Mix a regular yeast dough and shape it into small circles, 4 1/2 to 6
inches in diameter.  Then stretch these circles, from the center
towards the edges so that the center is slightly thinner and the edge
of the circle forms a slightly thicker rim. Finely chop the onion and
chives, mix with the egg and sour cream.

Stir in the nutmeg and salt.  Fill the center of the 'Waehe' with this
mixture.  Bake at moderate heat until yellow. Remove from oven, dot
with butter, and serve piping hot.
