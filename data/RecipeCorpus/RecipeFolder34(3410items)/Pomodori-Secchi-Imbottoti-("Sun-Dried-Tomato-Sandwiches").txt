Title: Pomodori Secchi Imbottoti ("Sun-Dried Tomato Sandwiches")
Categories: Appetizers, Italian, Tomatoes, Snacks, Vegetarian
Yield: 15 sandwiches
1/8 ts Red pepper flakes
1/4 ts Oregano
Salt & pepper
30 ea Sun-dried tomatoes
1 tb Olive oil
3 ts Garlic, finely minced
Ensure that the tomatoes are not overly salty.  Refresh them in warm
water to cover for about 10 minutes.  Soak them just long enough to
soften them, but be careful that they do not become soggy.  Drain &
pat dry.

Warm the olive oil in a small saute pan over very low heat.  Add the
garlic, red pepper flakes & oregano & warm for 5 to 8 minutes.  Be
careful not to let the garlic burn.  Season with salt & pepper to
taste.

Make the "sandwiches" by laying one tomato face down, drizzling a bit
of the herb-infused olive oil on it & covering with a second
sun-dried tomato. Serve at room temperature.
