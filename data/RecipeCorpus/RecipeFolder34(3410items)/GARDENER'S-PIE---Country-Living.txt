1. Peel and quarter potatoes. In 3-quart saucepan, cover potatoes with
water and heat to boiling over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and
cook potatoes until tender-about 20 minutes.

mushrooms, carrots, onion, green pepper, and garlic: saute until
lightly browned and carrots are just tender. Stir in basil, thyme,
1/2 t salt, and the black pepper. In small bowl or measuring cup,
combine water and flour until smooth. Stir into mixture in skillet
and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Quarter zucchini
lengthwise. Cut quarters crosswise into 1/2-inch chunks and fold into
vegetable mixture along with peas.

3. Heat oven to 425'F. Drain potatoes very well; return to saucepan.
With electric mixer, beat potatoes until well broken up. Gradually
beat in 1/3 C milk and remaining 1/2 t  salt until mixture is smooth,
adding remaining milk, if necessary. Fold in half of cheese.

4. Turn vegetable mixture into 3-quart casserole. Spoon potatoes over
vegetables to cover completely. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake
15 to 20 minutes or until potatoes are browned.
