Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Milk
4 lg Eggs
1/4 c  Plus 1 T sugar
2 ts Finely grated orange rind
1 ts Vanilla extract
3 tb Butter, softened
4    Individual brioches (about
-2 oz each) or 8 oz challah

1. Heat oven to 325'F. Lightly butter four 8-oz custard cups or
ramekins. Slice brioches crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices.
Lightly butter each slice with remaining softened butter.

2. Divide brioche slices among custard cups, arranging them randomly
upright and horizontal. Scatter 1/4 C blueberries between and around
brioche slices in each cup.

3. In medium-size bowl, beat together milk, eggs, 1/4 C sugar, orange
rind, and vanilla until well blended. Divide egg mixture evenly among
custard cups, pouring it over brioche slices and berries. (Tops of
brioche slices will not be covered by egg mixture.) Sprinkle
remaining T sugar over each pudding.

4. Place puddings in 13 by 9-inch baking pan; pour hot water into pan
to come halfway up sides of custard cups. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or
until the brioche slices are toasted and each pudding is set around
edges but slightly soft in center. Cool until warm before serving.
