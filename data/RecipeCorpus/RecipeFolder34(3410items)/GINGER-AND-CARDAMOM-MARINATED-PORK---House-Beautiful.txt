Title: GINGER AND CARDAMOM MARINATED PORK - House Beautiful
Categories: House beaut, Meats, Main dish, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 3 servings
2 tb Freshly squeezed lemon juice
2    Cloves garlic, minced
2 tb Minced fresh ginger
1/4 ts Ground cardamom
1/2 ts Salt
2 lb Country-style pork ribs
2 tb Honey
2 tb Peanut oil
Zest of 1 lemon, finely
-minced
Rinse ribs under cool water and pat dry. Place ribs in a single layer
on a large noncorrosive baking dish.

In a small saucepan over low heat, whisk together honey and peanut
oil, just until honey melts enough to blend well. This should take
less than 1 minute.

Remove from heat and whisk in remaining ingredients until combined.

Pour marinade over ribs. Turn ribs so that they are well coated.
Cover and allow to marinate for at least 4 hours at room temperature,
or overnight in the refrigerator, turning the ribs at least once,
halfway through marinating.

Remove ribs from marinade and transfer to a large baking dish. Bake
in a preheated 400'F oven about 35 minutes, or until ribs are cooked
through and well browned. Serve immediately.
