Categories: Country coo, Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 8 servings
2 ts Chopped fresh dill OR
1/4 ts Dried dill weed
1 ts Salt
1/2 ts Ground black pepper
2 tb Butter
2 tb Olive or vegetable oil
Lemon slices (opt.)
Fresh dill sprigs (opt.)
8    Bone-in chicken breast
-halves, skinned
1/2 c  Lemon juice
1 lg Egg
2/3 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
2/3 c  Packaged unseasoned bread
-crumbs
1 tb Grated lemon rind
1. In 13 by 9-inch nonmetal baking dish, arrange chicken, flesh side
down. Add lemon juice. Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1
flour to marinate chicken.

2. Remove chicken from marinade; pat dry with paper towels. Reserve
marinade. (The lemon juice will have made the chicken white and less
shiny, as well as having given it flavor.)

3. In pie plate, beat egg with 1/4 C of reserved lemon juice
marinade. In plastic food-storage bag, combine flour, bread crumbs,
lemon rind, dill, salt, and pepper.

4. Dip each chicken breast in egg mixture; then shake in crumb
mixture. In large heavy skillet, heat half of butter and oil. Add
chicken breasts and cook over medium heat until golden-about 8 to 10
minutes. Turn chicken; add remaining butter and oil. Cook until
chicken is cooked through-13 to 15 minutes longer.

5. Serve chicken garnished with lemon slices and fresh dill sprigs, if
desired.
