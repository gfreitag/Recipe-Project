Title: "Savory" Fruit Compote
Categories: Fruit, Herbs/spice, Desserts, Side dish, Companion
Yield: 6 servings
-- halved and sliced thin
6    Winter savory sprigs
1 tb Balsamic vinegar (or more)
-- (to taste)
12 oz Dried prunes
6 oz Dried apricots
1 c  Dried cranberries
1/2    Orange; unpeeled
This is a sweet/tart accompaniment to mild main dishes, or a
not-too-sweet dessert with slices of pound cake.

Simmer dried fruit and orange slices in water to cover for 30 minutes
or until soft.  Add savory sprigs and vinegar.  Remove from heat and
let cool to room temperature.  Serve immediately or refrigerate; if
the latter, let the compote come to room temperature before serving.
