its pink color, about 5 minutes. 2. Add tomato sauce, Italian
seasoning, and hot pepper. Bring to a simmer, remove from heat, and
stir in 1/2 cup mozzerella cheese. 3. In a medium bowl, combine

dough. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out to a 9-inch
circle. Place dough over filling in skillet and sprinkle remaining
1/2 cup mozzerella cheese on top. 4. Bake until crust is golden
brown, about 20 minutes. Cut into wedges and spoon out crust and
