Categories: Vegetables, Country liv
Yield: 6 servings
1/8 ts Ground black pepper
3 tb Butter or margarine
1/3 c  Pine nuts
1/4 lb Thinly sliced Swiss cheese,
-cut into strips
1 1/2 lb Ruby or rhubarb Swiss chard
-or a combination of chard
8    Large eggs
1 c  Half-and-half
1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
1/4 ts Salt
1. Rinse Swiss chard in water until thoroughly clean. Remove stems
from leaves; set stems aside. Place leaves in 8-quart saucepot; cover
and cook over medium heat with the water that clings to the leaves,
stirring several times, until leaves are wilted--about 5 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, thinly slice enough of reserved chard stems to measure
3 C. (Use any leftover stems in soup recipes.) When chard leaves are
tender; drain in colander. Cool and squeeze leaves by the handfuls to
remove as much moisture as possible. Coarsely chop chard leaves.

3. In large bowl, combine eggs, half-and-half, nutmeg, salt, and
pepper. In 9-inch skillet with ovenproof handle, heat 1 T butter over
medium heat. Add chard steins and saute just until tender. Stir
chopped chard leaves and sauteed sterns into egg mixture.

4. Heat oven to 350'F. In same skillet, melt 1 T butter over medium
heat. Add pine nuts and saute until golden; stir pine nuts into egg
mixture. Add remaining 1 T butter to skillet, swirling to grease side
of pan. Pour in half of the egg mixture; sprinkle with half the Swiss
cheese strips. Add remaining egg mixture; cover and cook frittata
over low heat 15 minutes or until bottom is set.

5. Bake frittata, uncovered, 8 to 10 minutes or until eggs are set.
Dot the top with remaining strips of Swiss cheese and bake a minute
longer. Remove frittata from oven; let stand 5 minutes. To serve, cut
frittata into wedges and serve from skillet.
