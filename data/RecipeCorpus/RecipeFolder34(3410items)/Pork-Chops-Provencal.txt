Categories: Meats, Vegetables, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1    Or 2 large Spanish onions,
-coarsely chopped
2    Or 3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
3 c  Homemade chicken stock,
-boiled down to 1/2 cup
Salt and pepper, to taste
2 tb Olive oil (OR as desired)
3 lb Pork chops
1 pk Fresh mushrooms (12 ounces),

1/2 c  Dry white wine
1 cn Tomatoes packed in puree (28
-ounces), broken up
Heat the oil in a 12- to 15-inch skillet over moderate heat and brown
the pork chops on both for about 15 minutes total.  If necessary,
brown the chops in 2 batches.  Set the pork chops aside.

Add the mushrooms to the skillet and saute them until lightly
browned. Add the wine and stir to loosen any browned bits from the
bottom of the skillet.  Transfer the mushroom mixture to a bowl and
combine with the tomatoes, onions, agrlic, parsley and reduced
chicken stock.

Return all of the pork chops to the skillet, making 2 layers. if
necessary. Pour the mushroom mixture over them.  Season very lightly
with salt and pepper.  Cover the skillet securely and cook over low
heat for about 2 hours, until the meat is almost but not quite
falling off the bones.

Transfer the pork chops to a serving platter and keep warm. Increase
the heat and boil the contents of the skillet hard, stirring
constantly, to a viscous, saucelike consistency.  Pour the mixture
over the pork chops and serve.

Makes 4 to 6 servings.
