Title: Viv's Spud Nuts
Categories: Breads, Desserts, Tasteofhome
Yield: 1 batch
MMMMM-----------------------SET FOR 10 MIN----------------------------
3    Eggs, room temp, beaten
1/2 c  Sugar
1 c  Mashed potatoes
1 ts Nutmeg
1 ts Salt
Flour
1 c  Water
1 ts Sugar
1    Package traditional yeast
Other ingredients:
1/2 c  Margarine
2 c  Milk
Let yeast set in warm water and sugar for 10 minutes.  (Should be
foamy if any good).  Melt margarine, add milk and heat to warm. Add
yeast. Add sugar, eggs, mashed potatoes, salt and nutmeg. Stir very
well. Slowly add flour enough to make a soft dough.  Kneed until
smooth and silky. (5-10 minutes).  Cover and let rise in warm place
until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.  Punch down and roll out about
1/2 inch thick. Cut with donut cutter.  By the time you cut all of
them the first cut ones should be risen sufficiently to cook.  Cook
in deep fat until golden brown. Turning halfway through cooking.  May
be dipped in glace or rolled in sugar. Usually I put 3 or 4 at a time
in paper bag with sugar and shake. Cinnamon may be added to sugar for
shaking if desired.
