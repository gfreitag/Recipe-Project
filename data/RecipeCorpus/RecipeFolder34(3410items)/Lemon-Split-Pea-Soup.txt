1. Combine the sour cream, cilantro or dill, and lemon zest in a
small bowl and set aside.

2. Melt the butter together with the oil in a 4-qt casserole over
med-low heat. Add the onions, jalapeno pepper, carrot, celery, and
optional parsley root and cook until soft, about 4 to 5 mins.

3. Add the cumin and cook for 1 min. Add the split peas and 8 cups of
the stock or bouillon, season with salt and white pepper, and simmer,
covered, for 45 mins, or until the peas are very soft.

4. Puree the soup in a food processor and return to the casserole. If
the soup seems too thick, add additional stock or bouillon. Add the
cream and just heat through. Correct the seasoning and serve in
individual shallow bowls, garnished with a dollop of the sour cream
mixture and the optional julienne of snow peas.

NOTE: For the adventurous, try substituting dill or tarragon for the
cilantro. Also, try substituting some of the different lentils that
are available for the split peas.
