Preheat the oven to 325 F. Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of
a double boiler over medium heat. Place 10 oz. plain chocolate, 8
fluid oz. double cream and 2 oz. unsweetened chocolate in the top
half of the double boiler. Tightly cover with cling film. Allow to
heat for 8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir till smooth. Set aside
until needed. Place eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract in the bowl of
an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on medium until
lemon-colored and slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Add the melted
chocolate mixture and beat on medium for 15 to 20 seconds more. Add
the cake flour, soda and chocolate chips and beat on low for 10
seconds. Increase to medium and beat for an additional 10 seconds.
Remove the bowl from the mixer. Use a rubber spatula and thoroughly
combine the batter. Evenly divide the mixture into 18 bake cups that
have already been positioned into muffing tins, filling the cups to
1/4 inch below the rim. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick
inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature. To
prepare the icing, heat 4 fluid oz. double cream in a 2-pint saucepan
over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. Place 6 oz. plain chocolate
in a stainless steel bowl. Pour the cream over the chocolate and
allow to stand for 5 minutes. Stir with a whisk until smooth. One at
a time, dip the top of each of Granny's cupcakes into the chocolate
icing. Sprinkle the grated white (or dark) chocolate over the icing
of the cupcakes and refrigerate for 30 minutes to se the icing. Allow
the cupcakes to come to room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before
serving. Makes 18 cupcakes.
