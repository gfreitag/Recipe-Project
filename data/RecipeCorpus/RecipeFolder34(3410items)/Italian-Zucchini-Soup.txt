Title: Italian Zucchini Soup
Categories: Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Black pepper
1 lg Egg -- beaten
1/2 c  Parmesan cheese -- grated
6    Basil leaves -- chopped
2 tb Olive oil
1    Onion -- diced
16 oz Plum tomatoes
1 lb Zucchini -- rinsed and
-sliced
1 lg Potato -- peeled & diced
Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onion and
saute until translucent, 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, crush the
against the side of the pan, and cook until the water evaporates and
the tomatoes are thickened, about 15 minutes.  Add the zucchini and
potatoes and enough water to cover the mixture by about 2".  Bring to
a boil.  Reduce the heat to a simmer, season with salt and pepper and
continue cooking until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
Add the beaten egg in a thin stream, stirring all the while with a
wooden spoon, and cook for about 2 minutes longer.  Turn off the heat
and stir in the cheese and then the basil.  Serve immediately with
crusty italian bread.
