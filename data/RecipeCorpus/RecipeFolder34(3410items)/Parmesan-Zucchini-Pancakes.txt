Title: Parmesan Zucchini Pancakes
Categories: Newspaper, Breads, Breakfast
Yield: 6 servings
1 tb Oregano; chopped
Salt & black pepper to taste
3 tb Olive oil
3 tb Parmesan cheese
3 md Zucchini; trimmed & grated
1/2 sm Red onion; minced
1 lg Egg; beaten
1/2 c  Flour; all-purpose
Toss the zucchini and onion together in a small bowl.  Beat in the
egg, flour, oregano, salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese.

Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Drop
mixture by tablespoonfuls into the skillet, pressing down with the
back of a spoon to flatten the pancakes.  Fry the cake, turning once,
until crisp and dark golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Vegetable pancakes are an excellent way to introduce new vegetables to
young eaters.  If you make them extra small, they can be an elegant
garnish for such delicate dishes as poached salmon or veal scaloppine.
