1/4 cup bacon drippings in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet and heat in a
450° F oven. Combine cornmeal, baking soda, and salt; mix well. Melt
the remaining 2 Tbs bacon drippings and combine with eggs and
buttermilk. Mix well and add to cornmeal mixture. Stir until smooth;
stir in cracklings. Pour into skillet and bake at 450° F. for 25
mins, or until golden brown. YIELD: 8 servings

NOTES : Cracklings are bits of skin and fat rendered from pork. In the
South they can be bought from Piggly Wiggly. Northerners can
substitute crumbled bacon, but the taste will be somewhat
different. Real connoisseurs of cracklin' cornbread insist it
be
crumbled into a large glass topped with Vidalia onion or not,
sprinkled with salt and pepper; and covered with fresh
buttermilk.
The less adventurous cover it with sweet milk.
