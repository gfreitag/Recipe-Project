1 x  Dash Sugar
1/3 c  Oil
1 ts Soda
1/2 c  Starter
2 c  Milk
2 c  Unbleached All-purpose Flour
2 ea Large Eggs
Mix starter, milk and flour in the evening and store in warm place
overnight.  In morning take out 1/2 c of starter for the next time.
Starter will store indefinitly in the refregerator as long as you
feed it as per sourdough instructions.  Mix all other ingredients and
cook on hot iron. NOTES: Oil may be either bacon drippings or cooking
oil. If there is left over batter (usually not unless a double batch
is made) cook all batter and freeze the left over waffles to use
later. Treat as toaster waffles. Submitted By LAWRENCE KELLIE   On
