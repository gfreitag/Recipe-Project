Title: Gf Starter for Sourdough
Categories: Bread, Sourdough
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Yeast granules
1 1/2 c  White rice flour
Pinch sugar
1 c  Lukewarm water
This recipe is intended for people who are allergic to gluten and
cannot make starter with wheat flour.

In a quart glass container or crock, add the sugar to the warm water.
Dissolve the yeast in the mixture. Add the flour, stirring well. Let
sit in a warm place until fermented and bubbly, 2 to 3 hours. When
bubbly and risen a little, cover and refrigerate. Starter is ready to
be used.

At each using, the cookbook author finds it works best if taken from
the fridge and allowed to warm about 1 hour before putting into the
dough mixture.

After each use, replenish the started by mixing in 1/2 cup lukewarm
water and 3/4 cup rice flour. Adapted from More from the Gluten-Free
