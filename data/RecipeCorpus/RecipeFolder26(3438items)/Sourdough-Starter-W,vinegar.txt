1 tb VINEGAR; VERY IMPORTANT<
1/4 c  Sugar
5 c  Unbleachd flour
-LYMAN EDDY (HKDS25A
4 c  Lukewarm water
1 pk Activated dry yeast
Pour the water into a crock or a wide mouth gallon jar. Pour in the
yeast and let it dissolve. Stir. Add vinegar, sugar and flour. Mix.
Cover w/cloth and set in a warm place to sour..(2 to 3 days). When
activity STOPS, the mixture flattens out. An amber colored liquor
comes to the top..And it SMELLS.. THAT'S IT! Mix it up. It will look
like whipping cream. Put it in a GLASS JAR with a screw type lid;
place in refrigerator. IT WILL KEEP FOR MONTHS. Growing better as it
continues to age at a very slow pace. I have no idea regarding
conversion for use in BM. IF YOU DO.. Let ME know..Ho-Kay? It is
super in pancakes; waffles; coffee cake; rolled bisquits; quick drop
bisquits; cinnamon rolls; cobbler; BREAD; cake; oatmeal cookies;
etc.. I wish you success and tasty eating.. DON'T BE AFRAID TO
EXPERIMENT! Good Sour Baking to You for Yours.. Lyman, at Sunny, Reno
