Start "corning" beef 7 days before serving.  In large pot, pour salt
and sugar into water, stirring to dissolve.  Add 2 bay leaves, 4
peppercorns, 1 clove garlic and pickling spice.  Place beef in brine.
Place weighted plate on beef to keep beef submerged. Cover pot and
refrigerate for 7 days. Turn beef at least once every day. Remove
beef from brine and wash well in clear water.  Place beef in deep
stock pot and cover with fresh water. Add remaining 2 bay leaves, 4
peppercorns and 1 clove garlic. Heat to boiling. Turn heat down
immediately and simmer slowly, covered, for at least 3 hours or until
tender.  Remove corned beef from pot and place on rack in shallow
roasting pan, fat side up.  Prepare basting sauce by combining
bourbon with brown sugar, mustard and apple juice. Pour basting sauce
over brisket. Roast at 400 F for 30 minutes, basting with pan juices
every 10 minutes. Slice thinly on diagonal and serve with remaining
sauce. Creme de Colorado Cookbook (1987) From the collection of Jim
