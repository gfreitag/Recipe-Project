Title: Another Lentil Loaf
Categories: Fatfree, Beans
Yield: 1 servings
1    Clove garlic, crushed
1 t  Dried thyme
2 t  Dried oregano
1 t  Dried tarragon
x  Salt and pepper to taste
3 T  Tomato paste or tomato
Sauce
2 c  Dry brown lentils, rinsed
1    Bay leaf
1 c  Uncooked fine bulgur wheat
1 c  Soft whole-wheat bread
Crumbs
1    Egg substitute, beaten
1 T  Ketchup
1 md Onion, chopped
Prep:  Cook lentils and bay leaf in pot with 6 cups water.  Bring to a
boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until lentils are soft and water
has been absorbed, about 45 min.

Combine bulgur and 2 cups water in  a med. saucepan.  Bring to a boil,
reduce heat, cover and simmer for about 15 min.

Preheat oven to 350F.  Transfer lentils to a large mixing bowl.  Add
bulgur, and remaining ingredients except tomato paste or sauce.  Mix
well with your hands until thoroughly combined.  Pat mixture into a
9" loaf pan. Bake for 40 min. until firm but not dry.  During last
minutes of baking, brush top with tomato paste or sauce.  Let cool
for 15 min.  Cut into slices and serve warm.

This goes wonderfully with mashed potatoes and your favorite
vegetable! The leftovers taste so good in a pita pocket, and if there
are mashed potatoes leftover, I stuff the pocket with both.   Mmmm!
Enjoy!
