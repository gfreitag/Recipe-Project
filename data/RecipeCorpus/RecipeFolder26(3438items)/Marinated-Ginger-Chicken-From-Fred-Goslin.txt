NOTE:  When making this recipe, it tastes much better if you find
sources for the exact ingredients such as the ginger root and
Imported soy Sauce. They usually can be found in the local asian
markets. Use domestic soy sauce and ground ginger as last option. Cut
chicken in to serving parts if not already in that form.

Place chicken in shallow baking dish.  In small bowl, combine
remaining ingredients; pour over chicken.  Cover, refrigerate 4 hours
or overnight, turning occasionally.  Grill or broil as desired,
basting frequently with marinade.  Refrigerate leftovers
