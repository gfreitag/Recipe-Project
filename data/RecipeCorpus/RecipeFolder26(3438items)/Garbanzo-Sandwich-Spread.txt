Do you like garbanzo beans? I take a can of garbonzo beans, smash
them up in a bowl with a little lemon juice, chopped onion, chopped
tomato, a little salsa, chopped cilantro, and a dash of cayenne
pepper and salt, and use it as a spread on bread. Warning: if you are
taking this to work, assemble it right before you eat it, otherwise
the bread gets soggy.
