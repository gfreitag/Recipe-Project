Title: Parmesan Pepper Wreath
Categories: Bread, Cheese/eggs, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 loaf
4 c  All-purpose flour
1    Egg
1 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
1    Egg white, lightly beaten
Additional black pepper, opt
1 1/4 c  Warm water (105 - 115 F)
2 pk Fleischmann's Active Dry
Yeast
2 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Medium grind black pepper
1 ts Salt
1.  Place 1/2 cup warm water in large warm bowl.  Sprinkle in yeast;
stir until dissolved.  Add remaining water, sugar, pepper, salt, and
1 cup flour; blend well.  Stir in whole egg, Parmesan cheese, and
enough remaining flour to make soft dough.  Knead on lightly floured
surface until smooth and elastic, about 4 to 6 minutes.  Place in
greased bowl, turning to grease top.  Cover; let rise in warm,
draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.

2.  Punch dough down.  Remove dough to lightly floured surface;
divide into 3 equal pieces.  Roll each piece to 28-inch rope; braid
ropes. Place on greased baking sheet.  Form braid into circle; pinch
ends together to seal. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place
until doubled in size, about 20 to 40 minutes.

3.  Brush loaf with egg white.  Sprinkle with additional pepper, if
desired.  Bake at 375 F for 25 to 30 minutes or until done.  Remove
from sheet; let cool on wire rack.
