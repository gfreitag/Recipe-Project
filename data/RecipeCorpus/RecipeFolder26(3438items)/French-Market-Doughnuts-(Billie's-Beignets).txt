Title: French Market Doughnuts (Billie's Beignets)
Categories: Dessert, Snack, Cajun/creol, Doughnut
Yield: 36 servings
1 pk Active dry yeast
1    Egg (extra large)
4 1/2 c  Flour
Oil for frying
Confectioners' sugar
3/4 c  Evaporated milk
-(undiluted from can)
1/2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Butter
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Warm water
Combine the evaporated milk, sugar, butter and salt in a saucepan.
Heat until the butter is melted, then cool to lukewarm.  Pour the
warm water into a large bowl and sprinkle in the yeast; stir until
completely dissolved.  Add the lukewarm milk mixture and the egg.
Beat in t cups of the flour.  Add enough of the remaining flour to
make a dough.

Turn the dough out onto a floured board.  Knead until smooth and
elastic, about 8 minutes.  Place the dough in a large greased bowl
and cover with a damp towel.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled
in size, about 2 hours. Punch the dough down on a floured board and
knead.  Roll out to a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick.  Cut into 2 1/2
inch squares, cover with a towel, and let rise for 1/2 hour or until
doubled.

Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 375F.  Fry the beignets a few at a
time until puffed and golden brown, about 3 minutes, turning once.
Drain. While still warm, sprinkle generously with confectioners'
sugar.

Makes about 3 dozen.
