towels. Arrange banana and pineapple on top of cream mixture, and
press in firmly. Spread whipped topping on pie; sprinkle with pecans
and cherries. Refrigerate 2 hours; store in refrigerator after
cutting. YIELD: 1 9-inch pie

NOTES : Crushed pineapple doesn't work well in this pie, because the
liquid in it makes the pie water. That is why the tidbits are
patted dry.
