MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
Heat oil in skillet. Using tongs, quickly dip each tortilla into hot
oil for a few seconds and place on a large cookie sheet. When all the
tortillas have been dipped in the hot oil, cover the bottom of a
13x9x2-inch baking dish with warm sauce. Fill one fried tortilla at a
time with I tbs sauce and I tbs cheese and green onions, mixed. Roll,
and arrange seam-side down on top of the sauce in the baking dish.
Crowd as many as you can in dish, but have one layer only. Spoon
sauce on top to cover, sprinkle with remaining cheese and onion
mixture, and bake in a 350 degree oven for 10 or 15 minutes.
Garnishes: Shred one head of lettuce and mix with 1/2 cup sliced
radishes. Season with 1/4 cup vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste.
Salsa de Chile Colorado 10-12 dry New Mexico red chiles pork lard
(optional) 4 cup cold water 4 cloves garlic 4 tbs vegetable oil 4 tbs
all-purpose flour salt chicken boullion 1 tsp vinegar 1 tsp sugar
Stem and seed chiles and pan fry in pork lard (this step optional).
Boil in a medium-sized saucepan in 1 quart hot water, stirring often.
Be sure to push the chiles deep into the water, as they tend to rise.
Cook, covered, over medium heat for 20 minutes. Allow to cool in
water they were cooked in. Drain chiles and puree in blender, 3-4 at
a time, each batch with 1 cup cold water and 1 clove garlic. Strain
into bowl. When all the chiles have been pureed and strained, heat
oil in a large skillet and brown the flour in the oil to a light
golden color for a mild-tasting roux. Add the strained red chile
mixture all at once and cook over low heat, stirring constantly,
until thick. Add salt and chicken bouillon granules and boil 2
minutes. Correct seasoning. Now add the vinegar and sugar and stir
well. Remove from heat. Freezes beautifully. One cup is enough for 6
enchiladas. This recipe makes a quart.
