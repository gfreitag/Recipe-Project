Title: Walnut Paste
Categories: Snack, Nuts/grains, Spread, Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
1 ts Ground cumin
2 cl Garlic, crushed
2 ts Balsamic vinegar
2 tb Virgin olive oil
1 lb Walnut pieces
2 tb Grated parmesan
1 ts Salt
1 ts Ground coriander
Heat the walnut pieces in the oven and grind them in a food processor
while still warm. Add the cheese, salt, spices, garlic, vinegar and
half the oil. Blend until smooth. Put into sterilized jars and pour a
thin layer of oil on top to seal. Label and attach serving ideas. Use
for sandwich fingers and inside individual brioches, fill celery
sticks, or spread on toast.

Note: No oven temperature was specified, I'd use 350...
