The cook who invented this recipe says, "I've startled a few guests
when I've told them we're having Pizza for breakfast.  But they're
delighted when I bring our this version.  It's an easy way to serve
eggs, sausage, hash brown potatoes, and rolls all at once.  And my
children like it too, even though they usually won't touch eggs for
breakfast." Source: Better Homes and Gardens _His_Turn_to_Cook_
