Title: French Canadian Suet Pastry
Categories: Pastry, French, Canadian
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Finely ground suet
1 3/4 c  Ice water (approx)
6 c  Sifted all purpose flour
2 t  Bakingpowder
2 t  Salt
Sift flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl.  Add suet and
mix well.  Stir in enough water with a fork to make a rather stiff
dough (Try not to add more than the 1-3/4 cups water - after you have
mixed it with the fork, try to gather it together with your hands.
If it is too dry, add more water a few drops at a time.)  Roll dough
a little less that 1/4 inch thick or as directed for your recipe.
This dough is quite easy to roll and handle when the amount of liquid
is right.  It is not like regular pastry and is chewey rather than
tender, but has a very special and delicious flavor especially
suitable for meat pies. Origin: Yvonne Snushall Shared by: Sharon
