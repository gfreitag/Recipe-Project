NOTES : The East Germans are devotees of dumplings, or knodel, which
they
make in seemingly endless variety. Some knodel are prepared
with a
yeast dough; others are made of flour or potatoes, and include
such ingredients as bread cubes, cheese, meats, fish, semolina
and
fruits. Knodel may be either savory or sweet and are served in
soups or stews, as accompaniments to meats, game, poultry or
fish
and as desserts. Following are typical kinds.
