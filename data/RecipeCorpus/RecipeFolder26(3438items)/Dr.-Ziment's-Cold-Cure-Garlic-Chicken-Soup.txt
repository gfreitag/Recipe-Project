THE UCLA EVIDENCE:  No wonder chicken soup is a fabled remedy for
colds: It contains druglike agents, similar to those in modern cold
remedies, says Irwin Ziment, M.D., pulmonary specialist and professor
at the UCLA School of Medicine.  For example, cysteine, an amino acid
released from chicken when cooking, chemically resembles the drug
acetylcysteine, prescribed for bronchitis and other respiratory
problems.  Pungent ingredients often added to chicken soup, such as
garlic, cayenne pepper and curry spices, all are ancient treatments
for respiratory diseases. They work the same way as expectorant drugs
and cough medicines, thinning mucus and making breathing easier.  The
more garlic and hot spices added to chicken soup, Zimert says, the
better the soup will be at clearing your lungs.  His bottom line:
"Chicken soup is probably the best therapy there is for a cold."
