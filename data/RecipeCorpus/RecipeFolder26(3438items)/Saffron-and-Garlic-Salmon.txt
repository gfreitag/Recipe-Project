Title: Saffron and Garlic Salmon
Categories: Fish, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
-or more to taste
Salt
1 1/2 lb Salmon fillets
-cut in 2" cubes
Cilantro sprigs to garnish
1/2 ts Saffron threads
1 tb Warm water
1 1/2 tb Butter or olive oil
Or a mixture of the two
1 tb Garlic; minced
Combine saffron threads and water in a small bowl and let sit for at
least 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 350Ã¸F.

Heat butter in a small skillet over medium-low heat. cook the garlic
until it turns medium brown. Drain off the butter into a large bowl,
keeping most of the garlic bits in the skillet. When the butter has
cooled to room temperature, add the saffron, its soaking liquid and
salt to taste. Toss the fish in this mixture until each piece is well
coated. Put the fish in a baking pan lined with aluminum foil. Bake
until the fish is just opaque through (cut into one piece to test),
12 to 15 minutes.

Drain accumulated juices from the baking pan into the skillet with the
garlic; set aside. Turn on the broiler and broil the fish a few
inches from the heat until the top is lightly browned, about 1
minute. Put the fish on a warm serving platter and cover to keep warm.

Reduce the sauce by placing the skillet containing the liquid and
garlic over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, stirring often.
When the liquid thickens slightly, pour it over the fish. Garnish
with cilantro sprigs and serve.

Note: substitute halibut, cod or snapper for the salmon.
