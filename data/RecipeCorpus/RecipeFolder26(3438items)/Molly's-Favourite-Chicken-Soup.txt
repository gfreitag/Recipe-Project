and remove the meat from the bones. Return the chicken meat, carrots,

Serve the soup in big bowls, over pastina, rice or spaghettini.

This soup's curative powers are released only when the vegetables are
mashed together in the bowl. Use a fork for mashing. Use a big spoon
for eating. Makes 3 quarts.
