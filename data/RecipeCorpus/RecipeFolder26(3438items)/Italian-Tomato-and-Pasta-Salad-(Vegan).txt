Chunks of tomatoes and lots of Italian spices make this a real
winner. It serves 8 as a side dish or 4 as a tasty main meal. In a
large bowl, combine all ingredients, mixing well. Add small amounts
of tomato liquid until pasta is evenly moistened. Chill several hours
to blend flavors. Mix well before serving. You can salt & pepper to
taste but the sodium in the nutritional analysis will not show that.
