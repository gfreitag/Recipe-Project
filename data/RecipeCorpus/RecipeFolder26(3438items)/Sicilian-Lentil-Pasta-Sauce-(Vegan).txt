Thick and rich with mushrooms, lentils and spices, this sauce is high
in protein and fiber as well as in flavor. If you like a thick pasta
sauce, this is it. In a large nonstick sauce pan over medium heat add
onions mushrooms and garlic adding a bit of water to prevent
sticking. Cook until tender, about 5 min. Add lentils and water.
Bring to a boil stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low and cover
and cook for 40 min. Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.
Cover and cook 20 min stirring occasionally. add more water if a
thinner sauce is desired. Serve over pasta or rice. Note: in the
original recipe it called for sauteing the onions & mushrooms in 2 t
of olive oil. You can do this but it will increase the cal & fat %
