From the _8-Week Cholesterol Cure Cookbook_ By Robert E. Kowalski.

In a food processor or blender, combine beans, onions, red pepper,
parsley, cayenne, Tabasco, thyme, garlic powder, and 1/4 cup of the
apple fiber. Process until smooth.

Place remaining apple fiber in a shallow bowl.  Dipping your hands in
the apple fiber, shape the bean puree into patties about 2 1/2 inches
in diameter and 3/4 inch thick.

Spray a skillet with Pam or Baker's Joy and heat.  Cook patties for 5
minutes on each side.

NOTES:  I find that my blender doesn't work very well on stuff like
this, maybe cuz it is cheap, and my food processor isn't out here, so
I just mashed it all with a potato masher.  It wasn't smooth, but I
liked the texture and it was yummy.  I put it on a whole wheat roll
with ff mayo, ketchup (sp?), lettuce, tomato, and onion.  It was
quite filling. Oh, and I made a much bigger patty than this serving
size, it was a little bigger than a typical hamburger bun. With this
size patty, I would say this recipe makes about 3 patties.
