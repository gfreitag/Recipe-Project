Recipe by: From The Farmers' Market - ISBN 0-06-055005-8 1. Preheat
oven to 375Â°F. Butter a 9 x 13-inch baking pan; set aside. 2. Sift
onto a sheet of wax paper the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and
salt, set aside. In an electric mixer, cream together the butter and
sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy. Add the eggs on at a
time, beating until well incorporated. Stir in the vanilla. Lower the
mixer speed and add the dry ingredients alternately with the sour
cream, beginning and ending with dry mixture. Do not overmix. Scrape
the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing it with a spatula. 3.
TOPPING: In a small bowl, cut together the brown sugar, flour, salt,
and butter until crumbly. Add the blueberries and lemon zest and toss
gently. Scatter the mixture over the batter. 4. Bake until the cake
pulls away from the sides of the pan and a toothpick inserted in the
center of cake emerges clean, about 30 mins. Cool on a wire rack,
then serve directly from the pan, cut into large rectangles.
