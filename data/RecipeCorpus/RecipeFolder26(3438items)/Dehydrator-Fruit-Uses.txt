Here are some ways you can use your fruit. FRUIT COMPOTE: Soak the
following dried fruit together, in amounts you wish, for several
hours or overnight....  choppped pprunes, pears, apricots, peaches,
raisins, and chopped dates.  Add water to cover and allow to soak.
You can add the dates and a sprinkling of sunflower seeds for the
last hour or so of soaking. This makes an especially satisfying
breakfast, or a delicious dessert.

FRUIT TIDBITS: Soak chopped, dried fruits, in water to cover:  Prunes,
peaches, apricots, raisins, dates... vary the amounts of each fruit
for different flavor combinations. OR: To about 2 cups of soaked
fruit, stir in about 1 cup of chopped nuts. Blend apricots or apple
chunks as for leather, and then add 1-1/2 cups of the puree to the
fruit/nut mixture. Spread to about 1/2 inch thick onto leather tray.
Dry until surface is dry and fruit feels firm.  Turn it over on the
tray, and continue to dry on regular rack until both sides are firm
and dry. Cut into squares and return to dehydrator to dry a bit more.
