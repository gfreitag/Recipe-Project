Stir chocolate and butter in small heavy saucepan over very low heat
until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes (chocolate may lose its
sheen and become stiff).  Stir in jam until blended and mixture is
smooth. Pour into pie plate.  Chill about 1 hour. Shape truffles:

1.  Start with chilled truffle mixture the texture of soft fudge. If
too cold and stiff to roll, leave at room temperature until it
reaches the proper consistency. If too soft, place in refrigerator to
firm up. 2. Place desired coating in pie plate or shallow bowl. 3.
Place one 16 x 18 inch length of waxed paper on work surface, another
on a cookie sheet. 4. Roll scant tablespoonful of mixture between
your palms to about 1 1/4 inches around.  Place on waxed paper
covered work surface. 5. Roll balls in coating and place on waxed
paper covered cookie sheet. Place sheet in refrigerator until
truffles are set; pack in one or two layers in a rigid, airtight
container and refrigerate.
