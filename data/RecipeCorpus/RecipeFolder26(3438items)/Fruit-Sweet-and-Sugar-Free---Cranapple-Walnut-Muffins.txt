Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly spray regular size or mini
muffin tins with lecithin. Toast the walnuts in the oven for 7-10
minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool. Then coarsely
chop them with a knife or with a pulsing action in a food processor.
Wash and sort the cranberries. Then coarsely chop them in a food
processor using the pulsing action. Whisk the wet ingredients
together in the order listed until well blended. Sift together the
dry ingredients into a large bowl. Make a well in the center and stir
in the wet mix. When half mixed, stir in the diced apples, coarsely
chopped cranberries and toasted walnuts. Do not over mix. The batter
should remain lumpy. Use a rounded #12 scoop (1/2 cup) to place the
batter into the regular-size muffin tins. Use a #24 scoop (2-3
tablespoons) for the mini muffins. Bake either size muffins on the
middle shelf in the preheated oven. Bake the regular sized muffins
for 25-30 minutes, and the mini muffins for 15-20 minutes. Turn the
muffin pans once to allow for even browing. Let the muffins cool in
the pan for 5 minutes before removing them to a wire rack to cool
completely. Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   10-01-94
