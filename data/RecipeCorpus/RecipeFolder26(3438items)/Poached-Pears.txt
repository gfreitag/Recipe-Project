Title: Poached Pears
Categories: Fatfree, Holiday, Dessert, Fruit
Yield: 8 servings
1 c  Cranapple juice
4    Pears, preferably Bosc
2 t  Fresh lemon juice
Halve, peel, and core the pears. Sprinkle freshly cut pears with lemon
juice to prevent browning. Place in microwave-safe dish and cover with
cranapple juice. Cover and cook on high 6 - 8 minutes or until pears
are fork tender. (Check the pears after 6 minutes; the fresher the
pears, the longer they'll take to cook.) Spoon juice over pears,
cover, and let stand 30 minutes or refrigerate overnight.

I love the texture and buttery flavor of poached pears. This microwave
poaching method is so simple that sometimes I buy a big bag of pears
and poach them all at once. They can then be refrigerated and covered
and eaten as snacks throughout the next week. Bosc and Bartlett pears
are the best varieties for poaching.

This is a nice holiday recipe because the cranberry juice turns the
pears a pale pink color. These pears are pretty garnished with some
fresh mint sprigs. This recipe is best made at least 30 minutes in
advance to give the pears time to cool.
