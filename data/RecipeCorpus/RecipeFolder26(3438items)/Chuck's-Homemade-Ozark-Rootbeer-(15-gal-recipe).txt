Title: Chuck's Homemade Ozark Rootbeer (15 gal recipe)
Categories: Beverage
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
1 c  Grade B Maple Syrup
2 oz Birch Beer Extract
1 lb Honey
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
1 ga Sugar (approx 8 lb)
10 oz Root Beer Extract
1 c  Blackstrap Molasses
Mix all ingredients in a keg, add water to fill keg, carbonate,
drink. Some comments regarding the recipe: I thought the molasses
taste was a bit harsh, I will try regular molasses next time and
perhaps use a little less as well. I will try substituting 2 oz of
sasparilla extract for 2 oz of the rootbeer extract. In any case, you
can mix the ingredients to your taste. This recipe produces a strong
tasting rootbeer with about half the sweetness of most commercial
rootbeers (warning: you will want to clean your draft lines after
dispensing this root beer, it leaves a flavor behind). It was
extremely popular with the underage college crowd because the
rootbeer was served just like draft beer. You can obtain the extracts
in 2 oz bottles at most homebrewing shops. In addition, you can buy
bulk extracts through restaurant suppliers, the one brand I know of is
'Universal'. While I artifically carbonated my rootbeer (for both
legal & practical reasons) you could ferment it to get carbonation.
There was an alcoholic rootbeer at the Great American Beer Festival,
I talked with the brewmaster who made it, and it is similar to my
recipe, but with the addition of a substantial amount of malt extract
to increase the fermentables.  His rootbeer was in the 6% alcohol by
weight range, and tasted very good on it's own, but didn't go well
with drinking lots of regular beer.
