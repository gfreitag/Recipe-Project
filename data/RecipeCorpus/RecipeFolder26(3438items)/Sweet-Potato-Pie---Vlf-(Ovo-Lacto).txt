Categories: Fatfree, Holiday, Sweetpotato, Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 t  Allspice
1/2 t  Vanilla
1/2 t  Salt
1 c  Evaporated skim milk or
Lowfat sweetened condensed
Milk
2 c  Cooked mashed sweet
Potatoes
5    Egg whites, slightly beaten
Or egg substitute
1 c  Brown sugar (granulated)
1 t  Cinnamon
1 t  Nutmeg
MMMMM----------------------PHYLLO PIE CRUST---------------------------
1    Box Phyllo dough
4 t  Sugar (optional)
MMMMM----------------------OPTIONAL TOPPING---------------------------
Cinnamon
1 c  Chopped roasted chestnuts
Preheat oven to 425.  Lightly spray 2 pie pans with nonstick cooking
spray.

FILLING: I used a pressure cooker to cook the sweet potatoes until
very soft  and not stringy.

Mash very well.  (I used a regular mixer)

Combine sugar, spices in a little bowl. Last add vanilla with the
spices and then mix into the potatoes.

Now , beat your egg whites and mix it in with the potato mixture.
Slowly mix in your evaporated skim milk and set aside.

CRUST * I took out the entire stack of phyllo sheets from the box.
Turned my pie pans over and cut the entire stack to the appx.
circumference of the pan so I had a stack of circular dough.

Quickly, (dough dries out very fast and sticks together) layer 1 or 2
sheets of phyllo on each of the pans, spray very LIGHTLY with
non-stick cooking spray and sprinkle with sugar and repeat until
crust is the thickness you desire. (For 2 pies I used all the phyllo
dough in the box) I moistened my fingers to seal the edge of the
crust and crimp as with a "normal" crust.

Cover edges of crust loosely with foil.

Pour filling into the phyllo crust.   Sprinkle chopped chestnuts and
cinnamon on top if desired.

Bake for 15 minutes at 425. Reduce temperature to 350 and bake for
about 30 minutes more.

Enjoy, all my SAD relatives loved it! (Before they would eat it the
asked me "is this a REAL sweet potato pie, you know what we mean" to
which I answered "but of course!")
