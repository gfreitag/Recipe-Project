dough. Turn out onto floured board and knead 5-7 min, adding
additional flour only as needed to prevent sticking. Form into smooth

portions, form into loaves and place in 2 #2 loaf pans. Cover with
towel and let rise in warm place 1-1/2 hr or until almost double in
size. Bake at 375 for 35-40 mins or until bread tests done. Turn out
