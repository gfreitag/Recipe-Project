Title: Substitute Bisquick #2
Categories: Mixes, Bread
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ea Tb Salt
1 c  Shortening
5 c  Flour
1/4 c  Baking powder
Sift dry ingredients together in large bowl.  With two knives, a
pastry blender, or your food processor, cut shortening in in
spoonsful until mixture is texture of course cornmeal.  If you are
using a food processor, start and stop often during processing and
watch it closely. Keep mix stored in labeled, tightly closed
container. It will keep on a pantry shelf 1-6 months in dry weather.
In very hot, humid weather, it's a good idea to keep mix in
refrigerator. Sylvia's comments: I mixed this up in my Osterizer
stand mixer instead of hand-cutting or using a food processor. I did
have to manually turn it against the way it wanted to go a few times,
but that was it. I used a very low speed. I have used this substitute
in a biscuit recipe, and it worked fine. Source: _Cheaper and Better_
