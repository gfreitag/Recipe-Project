Title: Sunset Sourdough Starter
Categories: Bread, Sourdough
Yield: 1 batch
1 c  Flour
1 c  Nonfat or lowfat milk
2 tb Lowfat regular plain yogurt
Heat 1 cup nonfat or lowfat milk to 90-100 F (nonfat milk gives the
most tang, whole milk the least). Remove from heat and stir in 2 T
freshly opened lowfat or regular plain yogurt (lowfat gives the
tangiest flavor).

Pour mixture into a warmed (rinse with hot water for several minutes)
1 1/2 qt container, cover tightly, and let stand in a warm place at
80-100 F. (Above 110 F, the bacteria may be killed; below 70 F, the
bacteria don't grow well.)

After 18-24 hrs, starter should be about the consistency of yogurt.
If some clear liquid rises to the top, simply stir it back in.
However, if liquid is light pink in color, milk is beginning to break
down; discard and begin again.

After a curd has formed, gradually stir one cup flour into starter
until smoothly blended.  Cover tightly and let stand in a warm place
(80-100 F is ideal) until mixture is full of bubbles and has a good
sour smell; this takes 2-5 days.

During this time, if clear liquid forms, stir it back into the
starter. But if liquid turns pink, spoon out and discard all but 1/4
cup of starter, then blend in a mixture of 1 cup of lukewarm milk
(90-100 F) and 1 cup flour.  Cover tightly and let stand again in a
warm place until bubble and sour smelling.  Use.  Or, cover and store
in refrigerator.

To maintain your supply, each time you use 1 cup of starter,
replenish it with 1 cup lukewarm (90-100 F) milk and 1 cup flour.
Cover and let stand in a warm place until mixture is bubbly again,
several hours or until next day.  Then cover and refrigerate until
the next use. Before using starter, always let it warm to room
temperature; this takes 4-6 hrs. If you want to bake in the morning,
leave the starter out the night before.

If unused, it's best to discard about half the starter and replenish
it with milk and flour about every 2 =============== Reply 2 of Note 1
