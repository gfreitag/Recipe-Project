Title: Peanut Butter Bread Abm
Categories: Breadmaker, Nuts/grains, Bread
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Peanut butter
1 1/4 c  Water; hot
1/2 tb Yeast
3 c  Flour, bread
1/4 c  Sugar, brown
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

The crust will get well-done, so it's recommended to turn down the
darkness control to halfway between the light and middle settings.

Sylvia's comments: came out nearly perfect the first time, with strong
peanut butter smell.  I'm sending it to Irene's school for treats.
