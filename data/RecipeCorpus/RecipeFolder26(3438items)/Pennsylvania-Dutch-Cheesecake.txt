1/4 c  Buttermilk
1 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
Pinch salt
4    Egg whites
3    Egg yolks
1 1/2 c  Lowfat cottage cheese
Beat salt and egg whites with electric mixer until stiff peaks form.
Set aside. Put all the remaining ingredients in a blender and blend
until smooth and creamy. Pour the cheese mixture into the egg whites.
Gently, but thoroughly, fold together. Spoon the mixture into a 9"
nonstick square or round cake pan. Bake in a preheated 350 oven for
40-50 minutes, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Chill thoroughly. The cake sinks in the center as it cools, making a
depressing for fruit. Fill with berries or sliced unsweetened peaches
to serve. Per serving: Calories--69.1 Carbohydrate--2.0 grams
