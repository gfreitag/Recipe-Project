1    Yard Cheesecloth; rinsed &
THE INITIAL STARTER MIXTURE: 6 days: Stir the flour and water
together in the container, mixing well; but do not worry about a few
lumps, they will disintegrate later. Lay the grapes on a double layer
of washed cheesecloth and tie opposite corners together to form a
bag. Lightly crush the grapes with a rolling pin, then swish the bag
through the flour/water mixture and submerge.  Cover tightly with a
lid or a plastic wrap and a rubber band. Leave at room temperature
for 6 days, stirring it up once a day.
The bag of grapes will gradually appear inflated, and liquid will
begin to separate from the flour base. The mixture will begin to
taste and smell slightly fruity, and the color will be strange. That
is how it should be. By the sixth day, the bag of grapes will have
deflated, the color will be yellow and the taste pleasantly sour; the
fermentation is complete. The starter is living but weak and it needs
to be fed.

FEEDING THE STARTER; 3 days: Lift out the bag of grapes and squeeze
their juiced back into the starter, then discard the grapes. Stir up
the starter thoroughly, transfer it into a clean container. (Although
you can use it after just one feeding, the starter will be stronger
and healthier with the full treatment.) Three days before you plan to
use it, stir 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of water into the container,
blending well. Let stand uncovered at room temperature until it
bubbles up; 3 or 4 hours; then cover and refrigerate.  Repeat the
feeding the second day, and again on the third. Your starter is ready
to use.
