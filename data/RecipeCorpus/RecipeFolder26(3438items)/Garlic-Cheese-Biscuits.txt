Recipe by: Fannie Flagg's Original Whistle Stop Cafe Cookbook Preheat
oven to 425Â° F. Combine baking mix and 1/4 tsp of garlic powder; mix

moistened. Roll or pat dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/2-inch

baking sheet. Combine melted butter and the remaining 1/8 tsp garlic

need
to split and butter them.
