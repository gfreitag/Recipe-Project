Title: Brasileiras (Brazilian Coconut Cookies)
Categories: So. america, Nuts/grains, Dessert, Cake/cookie
Yield: 40 cookies
2 c  Coconut; freshly grated or
;2 cups packaged flaked
;coconut
1/2 ts Vanilla extract
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Water
4    Egg yolks; lightly beaten
1/4 c  Flour
In a heavy 2 to 3 quart saucepan, combine  the sugar and water and
cook over moderate heat, stirring only until the sugar dissolves. Cook
undisturbed until the syrup reaches a temperature of 230 degrees on a
candy thermometer, or a small amount dropped into ice water
immediately hardens into a thread.  In a small bowl, quickly mix the
egg yolks and flour together until they are well blended, then add 2
tablespoons of hot syrup, stirring constantly.  Slowly pour the
mixture into the syrup in the saucepan, stirring constantly.  Add the
coconut and simmer over low heat, stirring, until the mixture becomes
very thick and stiff. Do not allow the mixture to come to a boil at
any point.
Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and let the
mixture cool to room temperature.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
Shape the cookie mixture, a tablespoon at a time, into small balls by
rolling it quickly between your palms.  Arrange the balls 1 inch
apart on a buttered cookie sheet and bake in the center of the oven
for 15 minutes, or until the cookies are a delicate golden brown.
Cool and serve.
