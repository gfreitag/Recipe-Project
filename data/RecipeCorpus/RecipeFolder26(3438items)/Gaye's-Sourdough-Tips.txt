You will find that your sourdough breads will have more "tang" and
will rise higher in the BM if you follow this procedure: * Remove a
cup )or more) of your starter from the fridge and bring to room temp.
* Feed with 1 cup flour and 1 cup (or slightly less) water * Let the
starter do its thing. It will become bubbly and foamy. Watch for its
'peak'. This usually occurs 8 to 10 hours after feeding. It is best
to keep the starter warm (75 to 85 degrees). If it cold out, leave it
in the oven with the light turned on! * Make your bread during the
peak...while the starter is VERY active. * Dump the unused starter
back into the mother pot. Following this method, you can even make
sourdough in the b/m without yeast. Really! *Variation: Separate your
starter into two batches. Create a "beer" starter with one batch. You
will feed this pot with flat beer and flour instead of water and
flour. A very unique and delicious taste! * To create your own
sourdough recipe: Substitute 7/8 cup start for 1 cup liquid Reduce
flour by 1/4 to 1/2 cup
