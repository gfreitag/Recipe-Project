package dry yeast 1 tsp sugar 2/3 cup warm water 1 cup butter, at room
temperature 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 tsp salt 2 tbsp grated lemon peel 1/4
cup nonfat dry milk 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 cups unbleached flour 1 cup ground
poppy seeds 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup raisins 1/2 cup milk GLAZE: 1 egg
beaten with 1 tsp water In a small cup, dissolve the yeast and sugar
in the water. Let stand for a few minutes. Meanwhile, combine the
butter, sugar, salt, 1 tbsp lemon peel, and milk in a large mixing
bowl. Then add 2-1/2 cups of flour alternately with the yeast
mixture.  Blend the dough well.  Turn the dough out onto a floured
board.  Knead for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and not
sticky.  Add more flour as necessary.  Put the dough into a greased
bowl, turning so the top is greased.  Let rise in a warm, draft-free
place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.  While the dough is
rising, prepare the filling.  Combine the poppy seeds, sugar,
raisins, milk, and the rest of the lemon peel in the top half of a
double boiler. Cook it over hot water until the mixture is of
spreading consistency. Stir constantly.  It should thicken in about
10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.  Punch the
dough down, divide in half, and roll each piece into a long rectangle
about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the filling on top of each piece, then
roll up.  Pinch the seams together so the filling can't come out.
Place the rolls on a large greased baking sheet and brush with the
glaze.  Cover the rolls with wax paper laid across water glasses so
the paper doesn't touch the dough. Let rise again for 30 minutes.
Apply a second coat of glaze. Bake the loaves in a preheated 325F
oven for about an hour.  If the top browns too rapidly, cover loosely
with aluminum foil.  Cool on a wire rack.
