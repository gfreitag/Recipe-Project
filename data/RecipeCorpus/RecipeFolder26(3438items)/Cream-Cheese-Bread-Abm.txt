Categories: Breadmaker, Cheese/eggs, Bread
Yield: 16 servings
4 oz Cheese, cream
1 lg Eggs
1/2 c  Water
1/2 tb Yeast
2 c  Flour, bread
1 tb Sugar
1/2 tb Salt
Cube cream cheese for easier blending.  Bring all ingredients to room
temperature and pour into bakery, in order. Set "baking control" at 10
o'clock.  Select "white bread" and push Start.

Tested in DAK R2D2.  Sylvia's comments: finally got this one to turn
out! I suspect it's more of a novelty bread than something I'll make
frequently, as it was okay but not thrilling.
