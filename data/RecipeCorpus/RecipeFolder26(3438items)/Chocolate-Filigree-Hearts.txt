Title: Chocolate Filigree Hearts
Categories: Chocolate, Dessert, Candy
Yield: 12 servings
1 ts Shortening
1 oz Semi-Sweet Chocolate*
*Ingredient List should read: 1 oz. (1 square) semi-sweet chocolate.
Draw 1 pattern of a heart design on white paper. Cut twelve 3 x 3"
squares of waxed paper. Set aside. In small saucepan over low heat,
melt chocolate with shortening, stirring constantly. Cool slightly.
Pour chocolate mixture into small squeeze bottle or pastry bag with
small writing tip. Place pattern piece on cookie sheet. Lay waxed
paper square over pattern. Pipe chocolate over outline. (Chocolate
lines should be about 1/2" wide.) Carefully slip out pattern piece.
Repeat, making 12 filigree hearts. Refrigerate 30 minutes or until
ready to use. Carefully peel off waxed paper; place on dessert.
Nutritional Info: 1 Heart: 15 calories, Carbohydrates, 2 g; Fat, 1 g;
Potassium, 8 mg. Note: I wish I could draw in this program, but
can't, so let me try to verbally describe the hearts--the hooked part
of the heart should look like a scroll. Do not fill in the hearts.
They should be just a 1/2" wide outline.
