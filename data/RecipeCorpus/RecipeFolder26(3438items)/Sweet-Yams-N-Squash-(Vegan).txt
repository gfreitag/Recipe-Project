Title: Sweet Yams N Squash (Vegan)
Categories: Fatfree, Sweetpotato, Vegetable, Appetizer
Yield: 6 servings
1    Dollop of honey or molasses
x  Sweet spices to taste-
Cinnamon, ginger, cardamom,
Etc
1    Squash
4    Sweet potatoes
1/4 c  Orange juice
1    Dollop of maple syrup
Heat oven to 350F.  Lightly spray a big-enough Pyrex pan with Pam.

Trim ends of squash, cut in half lengthwise, clean out seeds, and lay
flat sides down in pan.  Peel sweet potatoes (hey, it's up to you!)
and lay in pan.  Bake in oven until both are done.  (Check after 30
minutes, then keep checking at reasonable intervals.) "Done" = as
soft as you like them.

Remove the cooked veggies from the oven, cut them into bite-sized
slices and chunks, and arrange them in a serving dish.

Separately, combine the liquids and sweet spices.  Pour over the warm
veggies.  (There could be lots of variations on the liquids and
spices to achieve different kinds of flavors.  This was the combo
that I used.)

Either serve immediately, or refrigerate (covered).  Can be reheated
in a regular or microwave oven.

This yielded one medium-sized casserole full.  Probably "serves 6" as
part of a normal meal rather than a big office lunch.
