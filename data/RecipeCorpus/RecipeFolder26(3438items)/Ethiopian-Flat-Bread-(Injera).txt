Title: Ethiopian Flat Bread (Injera)
Categories: Fatfree, Bread, African
Yield: 15 servings
1 T  Active dry yeast (one
Package) (15 ml)
3 c  Self-rising flour (750 ml)
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour (125 ml)
1/2 c  Cornmeal or masa harina (125    3 1/2 c  Warm water (875 ml)
Ml)
Mix and let set in large bowl, covered, an hour or longer, until
batter rises and becomes stretchy. It can sit as long as 3-6 hours.
When ready, stir batter if liquid has settled on bottom. Then whip in
blender, 2 cups of batter at a time, thinning it with 1/2 - 3/4 cup
water. Batter will be quite thin. Cook in non-stick frypan WITHOUT
OIL (is that a great instruction or what?) over medium or medium-high
heat. Use 1/2 cup batter per injera for a 12-inch pan or 1/3 cup
batter for a 10-inch pan. Pour batter in heated pan and quickly swirl
pan to spread batter as thin as possible. Batter should be no thicker
than 1/8-inch. Do not turn over. Injera does not easily stick or
burn. It is cooked through when bubbles appear all over the top. Lay
each injera on a clean towel for a minute or two, then stack in
covered dish to keep warm. Finished injera will be thicker than a
crepe, but thinner than a pancake.

To serve, overlap a few injera on a platter and place stews on top (I
think most kinds of spicy bean or veggie stews/curries would be great
with this.
For Ethiopian food, the spicier the better). Or lay one injera on
each dinner plate, and ladle stew servings on top. Give each person
three or more injera, rolled up or folded in quarters, to use for
scooping up the stews.

I calculated that if you make 15 12-inch injeras, each would be about
120 calories, 3% CFF.  Not bad.  For a more authentic injera, add 1/2
cup teff flour (teff is a kind of millet) and reduce the whole wheat
flour to 1/4 cup.
