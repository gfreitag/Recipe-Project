Flatten pork chops with a meat mallet or rolling pin between two
sheets of waxed paper. Season both sides of each chop with pepper.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat.  Add pork and
saute until brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.
Transfer to plate.

Add shallots to same skillet.  Cook 30 seconds.  Mix in mustard and
chicken broth and simmer until reduced by 1/4, about 5 minutes.  Stir
in maple syru and vinegar.  Simmer until liquids are reduced to sauce
consistency, about minutes longer.  Return pork and accumulated
juices to skillet.  Cook until just heated through, about 1 minute.
Serve pork and spoon sauce over top.

NOTES : 1 Tbsp red wine vinegar may be used for balsamic vinegar
