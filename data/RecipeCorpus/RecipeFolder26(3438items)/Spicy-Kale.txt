* NOTE:  Kale is best stored unwashed in a plastic bag in the
refrigerator. In a large skillet or saucepan, saute the onion in the
oil over low heat until translucent, about 10 minutes.  While the
onion cooks, thoroughly rinse the kale.  Remove and discard the large
stem ends and coarsely chop the leaves. Add the moist kale leaves to
the onions and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until the leaves
are wilted but still bright green, about 5 minutes. Stir in the
vinegar and red pepper flakes. Add salt and pepper to taste.  Serve
immediately or at room temperature. Makes 4 servings. Per 4-ounce

Omit the vinegar and add up to 1/2 cup of prepared sauerkraut. Add
about 2 cups of cooked field peas or lima beans. Top with chopped
black olives and chopped hard-cooked eggs. [Moosewood Restaurant
