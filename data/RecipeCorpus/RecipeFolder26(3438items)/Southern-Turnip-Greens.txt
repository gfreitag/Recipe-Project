Title: Southern Turnip Greens
Categories: Side dish, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
1 ts Salt
1 ts Sugar
2 lb Turnip greens; fresh
2 oz Salt pork; diced
Recipe by: Fannie Flagg's Original Whistle Stop Cafe Cookbook Break
off large turnip green stems below the leaf and discard yellow or
wilted leaves. Wash well by plunging greens up and down in sink or
large bowl filled with water. Rinse sink or bowl to remove sand
before refilling; repeat procedure several times. Drain in colander;
cut greens in half. Combine 2 qts water, salt pork, salt and sugar in
a large heavy saucepan; bring to a boil. Add greens; cover, reduce
heat, and simmer 1 to 2 hours or until as tender as you like. Serve
in bowls with some of the "pot likker" and some cornbread crumbled in
each bowl. Or drain and place in a serving bowl. YIELD: 4 servings

NOTE: If turnip greens have roots attached, peel and cut them into
1-inch cubes. Add to greens during last 45 mins of cooking time,
making sure they are covered with cooking liquid.

COLLARDS: Prepare collard greens as directed for turnip greens,
except cut out center veins of greens before cooking, as they are
older greens and not as tender as turnip greens.

NOTES : The cooking juice from the greens is called "pot liquor" and
is
served as a soup. Dip cornbread into it. It is one of the best
things you will ever taste.
