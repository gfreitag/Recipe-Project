Title: Meat and Melon Bites
Categories: Snack, Fruit, Meat, Appetizer
Yield: 60 servings
-ham or turkey
Lettuce leaves
1 lg Honeydew melon
1 lg Cantaloupe
3 oz Package very thinly sliced
Cut melons in half and remove seeds.  Use a melon baller to scoop out
pulp. Cut ham or turkey into 1-inch wide strips.

Wrap 1 strip of ham around each melon ball, then fasten with a
toothpick.

Line 1 melon shell with lettuce leaves, then fill with wrapped melon
balls. Makes about 60.

A fancy melon shell makes a great serving bowl.  To make one, first,
cut a thin slice off the bottom of a melon so it sits flat.  Then,
insert a knife at a 45-degree angle into the melon slightly above the
middle and cut around the melon in a sawtooth manner.
