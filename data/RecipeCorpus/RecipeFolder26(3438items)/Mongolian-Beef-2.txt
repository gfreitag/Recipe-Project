Preparation:  Cut tops of green onions into 2" long pieces. Combine
sauce ingredients in small bowl & stir thoroughly.  Cut steak across
the grain into thin slices, about 1/2" deep by 2" long.  In bowl big
enough to hold meat, combine egg whites, salt & water chestnut flour.
Beat with chopstick until frothy.  Add steak, & use fingers to coat
each slice.

Deep-frying:  In wok, heat oil to moderately hot. When ready, piece of
coated meat will rise to surface immediately. Fry meat in small
batches; drop in 1 slice at a time to avoid sticking. Cook until
lightly brown, about 1 minute.  Drain on Chinese strainer or paper
bag.

Stir-frying:  Remove all but 2 T of oil from wok. With wok at medium
heat, quickly stir-fry green onions & ginger for about 20 seconds.
Add sauce; bring to boil on high heat while stirring. Add beef all at
once, & toss with sauce until beef is hot & coated. Push beef out of
sauce, dribble in cornstarch paste to lightly thicken. Recombine.
Serve immediately. Submitted By KATHERINE WALDEN   On   09-29-94
