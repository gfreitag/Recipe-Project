Title: Tomato-Garbanzo Quick Lunch
Categories: Fatfree, Beans, Tomato
Yield: 1 servings
x  Vegetables of choice
x  Spices
x  Garlic
x  Garbanzo beans
x  Stewed tomatoes
x  Rice
Mix cooked or canned garbanzo beans with stewed tomatoes.  I like to
use enough tomato to create a soupy mixture.  put this over rice and
nuke it at lunch time.  if you want to get a bit fancier, add some
spices and garlic and maybe fresh veggies (onions, tomatoes, pepper,
cayenne, oregano,...) to the garbanzo/tomato mixture and heat it all
for a while.  I love this recipe, and it's about as easy as they come.
