Flour
Oil, bacon drippings,
When I want to make a t'ick roux I use 3 parts flour to 1 part oil.
To make a t'in roux use 2 parts flour to 1 part oil.

Put oil into a heavy pot.  A black iron skillet or Magnalite pot works
well.  Pour in the plain flour and stir to mix well.  Cook on medium
or low heat and stir as the roux begins to change color.  You can see
that I usually cook my roux until it gets to be a very dark brown.
My roux sometimes takes more than an hour to cook.  Some peoples get
unpatient wid'that, but I use that time to think about many things.
When I cook a roux I relax myself, and you should also, too.  Be
careful not to let your roux burn.  You got to stir a roux damn near
all the time while it cook itself.  Me, I got a special spoon that I
use only to stir my roux. It has worn itself plum flat to the shape
of the skillet.

After my roux is cooked all the way plum' it gets a shine on it.  Now
add chopped onions, celery, and bell pepper.  Be careful not to add
too much celery and bell pepper; they are taste killers.  When the
onions are clear add chopped parsley, green onions, and garlic. After
these cook a little bit I pour in some cold water and stir. The roux
will separate, then come back together.  Now you can add the other
things to make a gumbo, sauce piquant, or gravy.

Some people make roux in a microwave oven.  They say it's much faster
than this method.  Well it is, but why cook if you can't have your
enjoys. This recipe that I'm jus tole you has worked for me for more
than 60 years and it's worked for many other peoples in South
Louisiana. Also, too, it taste more better.
