milk until lukewarm, add yeast, and let stand several mins to
dissolve. Stir in salt and sugar. Put butter in a large mixing bowl,
add 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk, beating very hard. Continue adding 1
whole egg and 1 egg yolk, followed each time by hard beating. When
all the eggs have been used, mix in yeast and then flour, beating
hard. Cover with a tea towel and place in a warm spot until double in
size. Pinch off pieces of dough and shape into smooth balls the size
of a large walnut. Place 2 inches apart on a buttered baking sheet,
cover, and let rise in a warm place for 30 mins. Press a hollow in
the center of each with your thumb and fill the cavity with
marmalade, jam, or prune filling. Bake in a preheated 350Â°F oven for
20 mins. Remove from oven and, when cool, sprinkle tops generously
with confectioners' sugar. TO MAKE PRUNE FILLING: Cook prunes
according to package directions. When tender, drain, discard pits,
and chop coarsely. Stir in sugar, softened butter, cinnamon, and
vanilla. Taste and add sugar if necessary.
