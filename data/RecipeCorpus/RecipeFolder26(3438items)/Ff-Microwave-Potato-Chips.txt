Spray a dinner plate with Pam. Place potato slices on plate in a
single row. Microwave on HIGH for 4 minutes. Turn slices over and
continue to microwave on high another 3 to 5 minutes. Potatoes are
done when they are lightly browned - if they aren't browned, they
won't get crisp. This may take longer depending on your microwave's
wattage but you will be safe with the initial 4 minutes of cooking.
You need to watch them carefully after that. Now comes the hard part
<g>. Remove from plate and toss in a bowl with salt or seasoning of
your choice and let cool! It is important to let them cool so they
can crisp up. This recipe makes a small amount but I think these are
tastier than the commercial fatfree chips. I haven't had such good
luck doing this with sweet potatoes unfortunately.
