Title: Denver Grainlette
Categories: Vegetarian, Fatfree
Yield: 2 servings
2/3 c  Sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 c  Water
1    Clove fresh garlic, minced
-or crushed.
1 1/2 c  Grain & lentil mix*
2/3 c  Chopped fresh tomato
1/2 c  Chopped green bell pepper
1    Sliced green onion
Put the water in a skillet.  Toss in everything above except the
grains. Cook down until the water's almost gone.  (If you like the
peppers less cooked add them after a couple of minutes.) Toss in the
grain mix, stir, maybe add a grind or two of fresh pepper, serve.
Serves two or one really hungry person.

* The grain mix:  I steam 1/2 cup wild and brown basmati rice, 1/4 cup
barley, 1/4 cup lentils and about 1/4 cup millet together, then use
it in all sorts of recipes like this one.

To make it even more like a Denver omelette, you could add no-fat
cheese, but that makes such a mess of the skillet that I didn't
bother!

I liked this.  HAving leftovers for lunch just as soon as I get off
line!
