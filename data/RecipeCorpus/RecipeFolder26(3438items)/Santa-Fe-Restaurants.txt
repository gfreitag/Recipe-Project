1.  Pranzios - "delicious Italian" 2. Zia Diner - "good salads" 3.
Cafe Pasquales - "good for b,l,d - wide range of choices" 4. The
Natural Cafe (mentioned twice) - "don't emphasize FF but very
accomodating" 5. The Coyote Cantina - "cheaper than the restaurant,
the food is good" 6. The Shed 7. The Santa Cafe 8. The Galisteo News
~ "great coffee and atmosphere" 9.  Cafe Escalera - "run by Deborah
Madison who wrote the Greens cookbooks"

With the exception of the Natural Cafe, vlf is dificult in Santa Fe,
but lf is not too bad.  I was also amazed at the creativity of the
local chefs - very unusual, but delicious, combinations.  Escalera
was a disappointment: the stuffed polenta was stuffed with three
cheeses. Two other restaurants not included in the original posts,
but which were excellent:

ALSO: Pauls - a local concierge described it as "one of Santa Fe's
best kept secrets" - until it appears in Conde-Nast, which it
probably will soon; and,

Inn of the Anasazi

Thanks again for everyone's help.
