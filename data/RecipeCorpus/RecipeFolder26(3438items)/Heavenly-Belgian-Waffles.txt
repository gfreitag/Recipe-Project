Categories: Breakfast, Fruit, Waffles, Nuts/grains
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Cooking oil or melted
Shortening
2    Egg whites
Ice cream
1 3/4 c  All purpose flour
1 tb Baking powder
2 tb Malted-milk powder
2    Egg yolks
1 3/4 c  Milk
MMMMM---------------------FRUIT PECAN SAUCE--------------------------
2/3 c  Packed brown sugar
1/3 c  Butter or margarine
2 tb Rum or orange juice
1/2 c  Broken, toasted pecans
4 sm Ripe bananas
Lemon juice
1 pt Fresh strawberries -OR-
Thawed, frozen, unsweetened
Strawberries
In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and
malted-milk powder. In a medium mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks. Beat
in the milk and cooking oil or shortening. Add to the flour mixture
all at once, stirring till blended but still slightly lumpy. In a
small mixer bowl, beat egg whites till stiff peaks form. Gently fold
into the egg-flour mixture, leaving a few fluffs of egg white. Do not
over mix. Bake waffles in Belgian waffle-maker or regular
waffle-maker according to manufacturer's directions. (To keep waffles
hot for serving, place in a single layer on a wire rack on a baking
sheet in a warm oven.)

Prepare Fruit-Pecan Sauce. Serve waffles topped with ice cream and
warm Fruit-Pecan Sauce.

Fruit-Pecan Sauce: Peel bananas, cut in half lengthwise, then cut
crosswise into thirds. Brush with lemon juice. Halve the
strawberries. In a large skillet, heat brown sugar and butter or
margarine over medium heat till the mixture melts, stirring
occasionally. Add the bananas and strawberries; cook, uncovered, till
bananas are heated through, turning once. Stir in rum or orange
juice, then the pecans.

Note: For a quick variation, sprinkle each waffle with 1 Tbsp chopped
nuts; crumbled, crisp-cooked bacon; or chopped granola before closing
iron.
