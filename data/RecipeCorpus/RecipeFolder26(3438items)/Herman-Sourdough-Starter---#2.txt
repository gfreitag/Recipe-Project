Title: Herman Sourdough Starter   #2
Categories: Bread, Sourdough
Yield: 6 servings
1 pk Dry yeast, dissolved in 1/4
-cup warm water
2 c  Milk
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 c  Sugar
1.  In a large glass or ceramic bowl, combine 1 cup of the milk, 1
cup of the flour, the sugar and the dissolved yeast.  Using a non-
metal spoon, beat until smooth and creamy. Stir in the remaining 1
cup milk and 1 cup flour.  Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set
in a moderately warm spot (about 70F.)  Let stand for 24 hours, at
which point the batter should smell pleasantly sour. 2. Transfer to a
tightly covered glass or plastic container and place in the
refrigerator. Stir with a nonmetal spoon once a day for 5 days. 3. To
use the starter, measure out what you need and let it come to room
temperature. Replenish it with equal parts of flour and milk, plus
half a part of sugar. (For example, if you remove 1 cup of starter,
stir in 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup milk, and 1/4 cup sugar.) The starter
may be stored in the refrigerator indefinitely, but flavor develops
best when batter is used and replenished often.
