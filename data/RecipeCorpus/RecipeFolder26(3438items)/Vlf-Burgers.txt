Title: Vlf Burgers
Categories: Fatfree, Rice, Vegetable, Burgers
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 t  Dry basil
1/2 t  Dry thyme
1/2 t  Black pepper (coarse grind)
1/4 c  Tamari
1 1/2 c  Short grain brown rice
(measure uncooked)
1/2 c  Onion (finely diced)
2/3 c  Carrot (minced or grated)
Cook the rice so that it comes out a bit dry (if it is very sticky
and damp let it dry some by spreading it on a tray for a while.)
After the rice cools, add all other ingredients, mix well, and sort
of knead the mixture a bit until it feels a bit sticky. Form into
patties about 4 inches round and about 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick (don't
make them to thin). Place on a nonstick baking sheet, and put into a
preheated 450 degree oven. Let cook for about 25 minutes, flip and
cook for another 10 to 15 minutes. If the mixture was too wet the
burgers will kind of flow and get thin. When you are making the
patties you will probably think that this can't be done. My family
loves these with onion tomato and coarse mustard. Thanks to a kind
person at the local Wellspring Grocery and Deli who was kind enough
to share a recipe with their customers.
