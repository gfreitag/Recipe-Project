Brewer, Cooking Echo, 11/93 [Note: We did this one for a Christmas
party one time and used a crockpot to keep it at the right
temperature. Worked just fine - but it's best then to put the spices
in a cheesecloth bag (or some such) as they must be removed, else the
whole thing eventually turns bitter. K.B.]
