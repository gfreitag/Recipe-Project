Title: Baked Snapper with Potatoes
Categories: Seafood, Fish, Potato
Yield: 4 servings
3 ts Paprika
2 tb Chopped Parsley
3 ea Medium Potatoes
1/2 ts Black Pepper
1 c  Water
3 oz Olive Oil
2 ea 2lb or 1 4lb Snapper
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ea Lemon cut into 6 or 8 wedges
2 ea Small black olives
1/2 c  Breadcrumbs
2 ea Garlic Cloves crushed
Remove fins and gut, scale, and clean Snapper (or don't remove fins).
Peel potatoes and cut into 1/4 inch thick round slices.

Use a baking dish large enough to hold fish(es), and cover the bottom
of the dish with the potatoe slices.

Wash and dry the fish(es) on kitchen towels.  Sprinkle 1 teaspoon
salt over fish and make 3 or 4 parallel, crosswise cuts across each
fish, about 1/2 inch deep.  Insert a lemon wedge in each cut, skin
side up. Insert an olive in the upward facing eye socket of each fish
(optional). Mix together the breadcrumbs, garlic, paprika, and
parsley. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of salt and the pepper over the
potatoes. Pour the water over the potatoes. Place the fish on top of
the potatoes, then brush them all over with the oil. Sprinkle over
the breadcrumb mixture.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Put the baking dish into the oven
and bake for 30 minutes, or until the fish flesh flakes easily.
Remove from oven and serve at once.

Outstanding whole fish recipe.  The potatoes are boiled in the fish
broth, and the bottom of the fish is poached/boiled, and the top is
baked.
