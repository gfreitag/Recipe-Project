Title: Hannah's Hoe Cakes (Hard Hearted)
Categories: Cake/cookie, Side dish
Yield: 1 amount
Salted cornmeal
Milk, or water
Pour enough very hot (not boiling) milk or water on some salted
cornmeal. Just enough to make it soupy, but not runny.  Then, let it
sit for an hour or longer.  You can then put 2 or 3 teaspoons of this
on a hot greased griddle or black iron frying pan.  Pat it down
smooth to make a cake about 1/2 inch thick.  Lightly brown one side,
then the other, and serve piping hot with beans, greens, or whatever
you got.

You can also cook these on the blade of a hoe on an open fire. That's
how they got their name.
