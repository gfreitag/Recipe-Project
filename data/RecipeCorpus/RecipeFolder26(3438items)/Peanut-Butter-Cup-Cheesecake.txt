Title: Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake
Categories: Cheese/eggs, Nuts/grains, Cake/cookie
Yield: 12 servings
1/3 c  Milk
4    Eggs
1 pk 9 oz. chocolate water cookie
4 tb Butter; melted
4 pk 8 oz. packages cream cheese;    1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
6 pk 1.8 oz. peanut butter cups
(2 per pkg.),chopped
1 c  Heavy cream, whipped
Softened
3 tb Flour
1 c  Sugar
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. In a food processor, grind cookies
into fine crumbs. Add melted butter and process until well mixed.
Press crumb mixture into bottom and two-thirds up sides of a 9-inch
springform pan. 2. In a large bowl, beat together cream cheese and
sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until light, fluffy, and
smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at at time, beating well
after each addition. Beat in flour, milk, and vanilla. Beat until
well blended and smooth, about 4 minutes. 3. Sprinkle 4 packages of
chopped peanut butter cups evenly over bottom of chocolate crust.
Carefully pour cheesecake mixture over all; spread evenly. 4. Bake 15
minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees and bake 40 to 50
minutes longer, or until edges are set and cake jiggles only slightly
in center. 5. Let cheesecake cool to room temperature, then
refrigerate until well chilled, 6 hours or overnight. Run a knife
around edge of pan to loosen cake and remove springform side of pan.
Shortly before serving, garnish with whipped cream and sprinkle
remaining 2 packages chopped peanut butter cups on top. Note:
Cheesecake are difficult to ruin. And if the top of your cake does by
chance look like the Grand Canyon, simply cover it with whipped cream
and garnish with one of the ingredients (and in this case, chopped-up
candy bars), or nuts, that are used in the cake. From: Dottie Cross
