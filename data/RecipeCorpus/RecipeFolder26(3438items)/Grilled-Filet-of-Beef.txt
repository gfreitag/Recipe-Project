Title: Grilled Filet of Beef
Categories: Main dish, Beef, Bbq/grill
Yield: 20 servings
1 lb Butter
2 ea Garlic cloves, sliced
1 ea Filet of Beef, whole
10 lb Kosher or Sea Salt
Dampened paper for wrapping
In a large pan, dampen salt by pouring very small quantites of water
on hands and mixing. (This will dampen but not dissolve the salt).
Cut small pockets in filet and place a slice of garlic in each. Take
filet and completly encase in salt to about 3/4 of an inch. Wrap the
salt encased meat in damp paper. This will keep salt intact when
placed on grill. The salt will harden into a solid covering in which
the filet will cook, retaining all it's natural juices and flavor and
*will not* take on a salty taste. Allow to cook on an hot, open grill
for 20-25 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a deep pan. When
meat is done (20-25 minutes should make it about med-rare) break off
salt covering. A hammer or meat mallet may be necessary. Place filet
on board and slice. Dip slices in hot butter and serve. Allow 1/4 to
1/2 pound per serving. Note: Using a complete filet takes care of a
fairly large group. Plan to cook it out of doors on a grill and
accompany it with corn on the cob baked in foil and a big bowl of
salad greens.
