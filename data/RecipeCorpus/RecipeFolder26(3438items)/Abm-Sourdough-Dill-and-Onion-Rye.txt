I just realized that I never added any sugar or dry milk. It doesn't
seem to miss them.  Next time I'll add more dill and onion. The jars
were almost empty when my baking fit struck me, so I went with what I
had.

I baked it on the regular bake cycle.  It rose almost to the top of
the pan and is a lovely golden color. Tastes pretty good, too.

*Starter:  2c all purpose flour, 2 c warm water, 1 pk yeast. Combined
and left in oven all night with the light on. It doesn't have a name
yet. Would "Bubbles" be too optimistic?
