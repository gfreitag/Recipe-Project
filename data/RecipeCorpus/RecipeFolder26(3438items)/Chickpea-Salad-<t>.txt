Title: Chickpea Salad <t>
Categories: Fatfree, Salad, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 t  Finely ground black pepper
2 T  Minced Chinese (or other)
Parsley [I used cilantro]
1    Fresh hot green chili (or
Green pepper), minced [I
Used 2 jalapenos]
1/4 t  Cayenne pepper
2    20 oz cans chickpeas or 4
1/2 c home-cooked chickpeas
6    Scallions, trimmed and
Finely sliced
2 T  Lemon juice [juice of
One lemon]
3/4    To 1 tsp salt
Pour contents of chickpea cans or home-cooked chickpeas into a
saucepan. Bring to a boil. Drain, discarding liquid. [You can skip
this step if you've just cooked your chickpeas].

Now that summer's heat is keeping our range-top and oven use to a
minimum, I thought you might enjoy this salad from Madhur Jaffrey's
_World of the East Vegetarian Cooking_. It sounds spicier than it
really is.

In a serving bowl, combine chickpeas with the other ingredients. Mix
well and set aside, unrefrigerated, for 1 hour. Mix again. Serve cold
or at room temperature.
