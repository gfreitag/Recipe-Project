Categories: Tomato, Cajun/creol, Casserole, Vegetable
Yield: 12 servings
1 1/2 t  Salt
1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
1 t  Basil
2 ea Medium yellow onions -
-chopped
1 t  Chopped fresh mint
-(optional)
3 to 4 slices toasted
-white bread*
4 T  Cooking oil
3 ea Green onions - chopped
1 ea Green bell pepper - chopped
2 ea Stalks celery - chopped
3 ea Cloves garlic - minced
1 lb Ground chuck - OR 1 lb.
-shrimp, peeled & deveined
6 ea Medium Creole tomatoes -
-peeled, seeded & chopped
Heat oil in a large Dutch oven.  Saute yellow onions, green pepper,
celery and garlic until they are transparent.  Add the ground chuck
and cook until browned.  If you are using shrimp, do not add now or
they will overcook. Add shrimp when dish is just about finished
cooking. Add chopped tomatoes and seasonings; cook over medium low
fire for 1 hour. Add green onions for the last 5 minutes.  If you
have some fresh mint in the garden, throw a few minced leaves in.
Some people like fresh dill. Make this your very own dish.

Makes approximately 4 quarts [my guess is 12 servings or more].

* If you want to use this for a stuffing for tomatoes, sweet green
peppers or eggplant, add crumbled toast to absorb the juice.
