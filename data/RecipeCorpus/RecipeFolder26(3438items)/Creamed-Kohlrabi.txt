NOTES : A favorite vegetable in East Germany, as well as in Poland and
Hungary, is kohlrabi, or the "cabbage turnip," which is
prepared
similarly in the various cuisines. Its thick skin should be cut
off completely before cooking, The vegetable is an excellent
accompaniment to roast pork. If the leaves are tender, they may
also be cooked.
