Title: Barley Mushroom Casserole  (Vegan)
Categories: Vegetable, Casserole, Fatfree
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 c  Water
Salt and pepper; to taste
5 1/4 oz Barley; 3/4 cup
1 c  Chopped onions
2 c  Sliced mushrooms
2 pk Instant broth/season
Add your favorite spice to this casserole, if you wish. Try 1/2
teaspoon of either curry powder, basil, oregano, dill or thyme or
enjoy it as it is with the delicious subtle flavor of mushrooms. In a
medium saucepan over medium heat cook onions & mushrooms till tender
about 10 min adding small amounts of water if necessary to prevent
drying. Add broth mix, water and salt & pepper and bring to a boil.
Stir in barley, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 50min until
barley is tender and liquid is absorbed. Stir occassionally while
cooking and add more water if necessary. Note: I eliminated the 2T+2t
of reduced calorie margarine to reduce the 5g per serving of fat in
the original recipe.
