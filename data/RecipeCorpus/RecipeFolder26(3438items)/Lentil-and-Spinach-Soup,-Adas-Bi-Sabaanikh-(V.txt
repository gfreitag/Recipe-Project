Categories: Soup/stew, Fatfree, Beans, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
2 bn Spinach; cleaned & chopped
1/2 c  Fresh parsley
1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
1/8 ts Crushed red hot pepper flake
1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 c  Dried lentils
8 c  Water
1 lg Onion; chopped
3    Garlic cloves; crushed

This is a Middle Eastern soup, typical of the simple foods served in
the desert regions. Serve with pita bread and a grain or vegetable
dish for a simple meal. This soup is also food served cold, stuffed
into a pita bread. Place the lentils and water in a large pot. Bring
to a boil, cover, and cook for 30 minutes over medium low heat. Add
the onion , tomato paste and garlic and cook an additional 30
minutes. Add the spinach, parsley, and peppers. Mix well and cook for
another 10 minutes. Add the lemon juice just before serving. Mix in
well and serve at once. I added a bit of fresh ground nutmeg & salt
to taste. Note: I have found that balsamic vinegar in place of lemon
juice is wonderful with lentils and imparts a slightly sweet taste...
