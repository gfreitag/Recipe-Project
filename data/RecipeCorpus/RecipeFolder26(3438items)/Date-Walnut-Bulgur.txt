Title: Date Walnut Bulgur
Categories: Nuts/grains, Breakfast, Fruit
Yield: 2 to 4
1 T  Date sugar or 2 chopped
-dates
1/3 c  Instant dry milk (optional)
1 t  Butter or oil (optional)
1/4 c  Walnuts
1 c  Bulgur with a pinch of salt
2 c  Water
Preheat the pot and lightly toast the walnuts (avoid burning). Add the
bulgur and stir to absorb the oil. Add the water and salt and cook 3
to 5 minutes, until the water is absorbed and the bulgur is tender.
Stir in the dates. Serve with milk, if desired.

For longer trips or to avoid carrying liquid oil, the walnuts contain
enough oil to toast a little. The milk can be mixed in dry or mixed
to make one cup of liquid milk; this balances some of the amino acids
in the grain and nuts, but may be omitted.

This is a hearty, stick-to-your ribs breakfast I use for winter
camping or when I am really going to be active.
