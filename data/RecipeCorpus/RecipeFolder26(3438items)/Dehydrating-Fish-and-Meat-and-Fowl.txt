The following 'recipes'
-(methods really) are
-pretty classic; you'll find
That drying meat and fish
MMMMM----------------SALMON, HALIBUT, SOLE, COD,---------------------
Clean and filet.  Be sure to remove all fat skin.  Dip the cubed fish
into soy sauce and dry on a cooky sheet until sufficiently dry to
transfer to trays.  Dry it quickly, if it will be sotred for a long
time, dry very hard.  If for more or less immediate use, stop the
drying at any point desired.  This method gives a delicious, almost
smoky flavor. SMELT, OR OTHER SMALL FISH: Clean, but no need to
remove bones. Slit down the middle and lay out flat. Dip into soy
sauce, or use the 'sprinkle' method; occasionally add soy sauceduring
drying. (This method is a joy for tasters, because it requres a lot
of tasting to get the flavorjust right.) When thoroughly dry, the
bonescan readily be chewed with the fish.  Freshly dried smelt are a
real treat.  Be sure to dry them very hard, however, for long term
storage. We recommend cool, dark storage in tightly closed jars for
all dried fish or meat. After drying fish, the dehydrator trays
should be thoroughly washed to remove any fishy okor. Setting your
dehydroator outside in a protected areasuch as a carport makes fish
drying more pleasant, though really fresh fish are never a problem.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%% BEEF JERKY %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Easy, fast, good results.  Start with very
lean meat.  REmove all visible fat and slice into thin strips. (Fland
steak is the cut usually used for drying; slice it with the grain for
chewiness, or against the grain for a more tender jerky.)  Sprinkle
meat strips with a little quality salt, if desired.  The meat strips
dry quickly, taste delicious, with no further ado; but if desired may
be dipped into or sprinkled with soy sauce for a different, more
'smoky' flavor.  Dry very hard for long term storage; store in
tightly lidded jars in a cool, dark place. Try adding bits of jerky
to a green salad. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%% FOWL %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Remove any fatty skin or fattissue.  Slice or cut
up as desired (keeping pieces quite thing, for fast drying)  Pieces
may be lightly dustedwith poultry seasoning before drying, if
desired, or with vegetable salt. Dry quickly.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%% MINCEMEAT LEATHER %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% For that homemade mincemeat you've
been saving.  Puree the minemeat in your blender and spread evenly
over leather trays to dry.  Dry the same as for basic apple leather,
about 1/4 inch thick.  Mincemeat leather, unexpected and delicious.
