-always a big hit.

Pour beans into a large casserole dish.  Add the fried bacon, chopped
onion, brown sugar, molasses, maple syrup, & catsup. Mix well and
bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours or until most
of the liquid is cooked off but not dry. Note: This recipe doubles
easily. Get one of the huge cans of baked beans from Price Club and
double the remaining ingredients. Note: We tried this for July 4th
and they are good. Very rich! From:  Fran Siebengartner (DKWJ78A),
