Title: GingerBread Scones
Categories: Bread, Herbs/spice
Yield: 8 servings
1/4 c  Butter
1 ea Egg yolk, beaten
1/3 c  Molasses
1/4 c  Milk
1 ea Egg white, slightly beaten
Coarse sugar, optional
Whipped cream, optional
2 c  All-purpose flour
3 T  Brown sugar
2 t  Baking powder
1 t  Ground ginger
1/2 t  Baking soda
1/2 t  Salt
1/2 t  Ground cinnamon
In a large mixing bowl combine the flour, brown sugar, baking powder,
ground ginger, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.  Using a pastry
blender, cut in the butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Make a well in the center. In a small mixing bowl stir together the
egg yolk, molasses, and milk; add all at once to center of the flour
mixture.  With a fork, stir until combined (mixture may seem dry).
Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Quickly knead dough for
10 to 12 strokes or until nearly smooth. Pat or lightly roll dough
into a 7 inch circle. Cut into 8 wedges. Arrange wedges on an
ungreased baking sheet about 1 inch apart. Brush with egg white and
sprinkle with sugar if desired. Bake in a 400 oven for 12 to 15
minutes or until light brown.  Cool scones on a wire rack for 20
minutes. Serve warm with Whipped Cream, if desired. Source: Better
