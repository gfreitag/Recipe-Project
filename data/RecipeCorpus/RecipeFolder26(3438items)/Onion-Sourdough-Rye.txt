The day before you wish to make this bread, place the onions in a
small bowl with the starter.  Cover the bowl and leave at room
temperature for 12 hours.  Fit the kneading blade firmly on the shaft
in the bread pan. Carefully measure the dry ingredients and transfer
to the pan. Add the onions and starter, water, yogurt, oil and yeast.
Place the bread pan inside the machine and close the lid. Program the
breadmaker for the whole wheat mode.  The unit will begin its
operation. At the end of the baking cycle, remove the bread promptly
from the machine, taking care, as the oven surfaces will be very hot.
Invert the bread pan onto a wire rack and shake several times to
dislodge the bread. Allow to cool completely on the rack before
slicing or wrapping for store. Source: The Bread Machine Gourmet by
