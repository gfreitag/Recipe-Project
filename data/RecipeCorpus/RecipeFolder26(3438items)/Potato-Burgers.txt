Title: Potato Burgers
Categories: Vegetarian, Fatfree, Potato
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
1/4 c  Water
1/2    To 1 raw onion grated
4 lg Potatoes grated
Mix all ingredients in a bowl.  Using a non-stick pan on medium heat,
or a griddle at 325 degrees, ladle the mixture on pan and mash down
until flat about burger thickness. Cook for 8-10 minutes. Turn over
and cook 5-8 minutes.

Hints: Use a food processor to grate the potato and onion. The onion
may get gooy but that's o.k. Ore Ida has hash browns that are already
grated, and I've been meaning to try that as a time saver but haven't
done it yet. If any one has done this please post your success. If
you want to double this recipe, use separate bowls or it is too hard
to mix, I've already tried. These freeze well. I usually think of one
potato as a serving. For two people the above recipe could be dinner
and lunch. Top with all your favorite low fat condiments. It
surprised us at how much these taste like Real hamburgers with all
the toppings.
