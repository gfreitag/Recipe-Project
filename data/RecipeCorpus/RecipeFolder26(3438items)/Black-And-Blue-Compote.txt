blueberries, blackberries, and 1 cup of cold water in a heavy

Uncover and add the brown and white sugars, corn syrup, and salt.
Return the mixture to a boil. Meanwhile, in a cup or small bowl, stir
together the cornstarch and 2 Tbs cold water until smooth. Add this
mixture to the saucepan, stirring. 3. Simmer until the compote has
lightly thickened and the berries are tender, about 5 mins longer.
Remove from heat. When compote has cooled slightly, add lemon juice
to taste. Serve warm or cold.

NOTES : A berry-studded sauce for waffles, pancakes, ice cream, or
custards. It's also delicious stirred into yogurt.
