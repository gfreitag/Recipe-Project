1/2 t  Salt
1/2 t  Fresh ground cardamom, or
-finely crushed
1 ea Orange, grated peel of (opt)
5 c  Unsifted flour (about)
1 ea Egg yolk
1 T  Milk
1/2 c  Butter
1 pk Yeast (active dry or
-compressed)
3 T  Lukewarm water
2 ea Eggs, beaten
1 c  Milk, scalded and cooled
1/2 c  Sugar
Melt butter and set aside to cool. Blend yeast with water. In a large
mixing bowl combine beaten eggs, milk, sugar, salt, cardamom, grated
orange peel, yeast mixture, and butter. Stir in enough flour to make
a fairly stiff dough. Turn onto a floured board and knead until dough
is smooth. Shape into a ball and place in a greased bowl; cover. Put
in a warm place and let rise until nearly double in bulk, about 2
hours. Punch down and divide in 2 equal portions (or 3 portions for
smaller loaves), then divide each portion into thirds. Roll each
third between hands to form strands 18 to 24 inches long (make all
the same length), rolling from center. Place 3 strands on a board,
crossing in the center, and braid out to each end. Form braid in a
ring and pinch ends together. Place on a greased baking sheet. Repeat
process to make the second braid. Cover lightly with waxed paper and
let rise in a warm place until nearly double, from 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
Paint each braid with a mixture of egg yolk beaten with the 1 tbsp
milk. Bake at 350-F for about 45 minutes or until a medium brown. Let
cool on wire racks (or serve warm). Decorate, if desired. Wrap
airtight; to freeze braids, seal in foil. Slice to serve. For an
additional authentic touch of tradition, sprinkle braids with chopped
almonds before baking.
