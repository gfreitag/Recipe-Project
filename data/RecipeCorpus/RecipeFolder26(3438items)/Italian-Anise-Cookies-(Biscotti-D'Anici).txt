DESCRIPTION:  Crunchy, almond biscotti perfect for dunking in coffee,
tea or your favorite dessert wine. Can be dipped in chocolate, too!

Preheat oven to 325. Beat together butter, sugar, salt, lemon and
orange zest and anise seed until light. Add eggs one at a time,
blending after each addition. Stir in flour, baking powder and soda,
and nuts. Divide dough into thires. With buttered fingers, shape each
portion into a log, about 12 inches long and 1 1/2 inches in
diameter. Place logs on well-greased baking sheets (two logs on one
sheet, third log on a second sheet). Using palms, flatten loaves to
about 1-inch thickness. Bake 25 minutes, rotating sheets midway
through baking. Remove loaves from oven, reduce heat to 275. Using a
thin bladed knife, cut loaves at a 45-degree angle into 3/4-inch
slices. Lay slices, cut-side down, 1 1/2 inches apart on baking
sheets. Bake an additional 40 minutes, or until very dry. Cool
cookies on rack. Store airtight 10 days. CHOCOLATE-DIPPED BISCOTTI.
Melt 6 oz of semisweet chocolate. Line 2 large baking sheets with
waxed paper. Dip 3/4 inch of both ends of cooled cookies in melted
chocolate, lay on papered sheets to dry. From "The Joy of Cookies,"
