Title: Asparagus and Mushrooms with Black Bean Sauce
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Mushroom, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 1 servings
1 1/2 T  Rice vinegar
1 T  Tamari (or soy sauce)
1 t  Potato starch (or
Cornstarch)
1 t  Brown sugar
1 T  Sake or other rice wine
1 lb Asparagus, stiff ends
Peeled
1/4 lb Brown button mushrooms (or
Mixed mushrooms)
2    Garlic cloves
1 T  Fermented black soybeans
Cut asparagus on the diagonal into 1-2 inch pieces. Blanch for 5
minutes in boiling water.  Drain and set aside.

Wash and slice mushrooms. Set aside.

Mince the garlic. Rinse the black beans well.  Mix garlic and beans
together. Set aside.

Mix together the rice vinegar, tamari, starch, sugar, and sake. Set
aside.

Fill a glass with water and set handy next to the stove. Put a
skillet over high heat.  When the pan is hot, dump the garlic mixture
into the pan. Stir fry for one minute, adding water as the mixture
begins to stick -- add just a little at time.  Add the asparagus and
stir fry for 10 minutes (or until asparagus is just shy of being
crisp-done), again adding water just as needed.  Add mushrooms and
stir fry for 2-5 more minutes. Add the vinegar mixture (giving it a
last stir to make sure starch is well mixed), stir until evenly
coated and sauce thickens. Serve immediately.

Comments:

Fermented black soybeans are available in Asian markets. Usually
labled "salted black beans".  I find them in the preserved food
section in plastic bags.
