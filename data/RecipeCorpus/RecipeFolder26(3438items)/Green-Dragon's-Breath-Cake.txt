Take 13x9 sheet cake and place on foi-lined cardboard base.

Tape 2  81/2x 11 sheets of tracing paper to make 17x11 sheet.

Trace a dragon pattern and cut out. Place pattern on cake and cut out
with a knife.

Frost cake with green icing. Use red icing to make an eye,nostril and
a scale pattern to resemble a dragon.

Take the 5 inch high coat box and cut away and remove one whole long,
narrow side so you can reach into the empty box and from that side
with ease.  Place the frosted cake on top of the box.

With a sharp shewer poke a hole through the cardboard base and coat
box. Ream the hole out so that the plastic straw will fit snugly. Now
insert all the way into the coat box so it cannot be seen on the
surface of the cake.

Now poke a hole in the center of the plastic deli container lid just
so the plastic straw will fit snugly.  Reach into the box with the
lid and fit the lid onto the straw so that about 1 inch of the straw
sticks into the otherside of the lid.  Now you are ready to produce
the special effect.

When you are ready to present the Breathing Dragon place 3 or 4
walnut size chunks of dry ice into the empty deli container and half
fill with hot tap water. (WEAR GLOVES WHEN HANDLING DRY ICE)

Vapor will begin to pour out so quickly place the smoking container
inside the box and fit the lid/straw tightly over the container.  The
vapor will be under pressure and will shoot up through the straw and
the dragon's nostrils.
