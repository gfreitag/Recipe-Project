Sprinkle or crumble yeast into a small dish. Add water, very warm for
dry yeast and lukewarm for compressed yeast. After a minute or two,
stir to dissolve. Cream butter in a large bowl. Add egg yolks, sugar,
salt and lemon rind, beating after each addition. Stir in yeast; mix
again. Add 2 cups of flour. Then alternately add remaining flour and
cream; mix well to make a soft dough. Form into a ball and put in a
greased bowl. Turn over. Put in a warm place, covered with a towel,
to rise until doubled in bulk. Turn out on a floured board; roll to a
thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut into 2-inch rounds. Arrange on ungreased
cookie sheets; let rise, covered, in a warm place until doubled in
bulk. Make depression in the center of each round; put in an adequate
amount of jam. Bake in a preheated moderate oven (375Â°F.) about 12
mins, or until cooked. Sprinkle with confectioners' suger. Makes
about 4 dozen.

NOTES : This very well known yeast-raised bun may be filled with
apples,
apricots, plums, peaches, nuts, a cottage cheese mixture, poppy
seeds or jam. Native to Bohemia, kolacky are beloved throughout
Czechoslovakia.
