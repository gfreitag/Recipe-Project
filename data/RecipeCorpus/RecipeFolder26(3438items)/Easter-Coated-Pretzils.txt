Title: Easter Coated Pretzils
Categories: Holiday, Candy, Chocolate
Yield: 1 servings
1 pk Small prestzils
2 lb White or colored coating
-or chocolate
I like to use up the left over colors from making Easter candy and
coat pretzil for the very little ones. They love the different
colored pretzils, And especially the chocolate ones,<G> so do the
grown ups. Again just melt your coatings,chocolate or white, or color
the white. Melt in small bowls in pan of water, just warm never hot.
Dip the pretzils in and lift with a fork, shaking off excest coating.
and lay on wax paper cooky sheet, that will fit  in your freezer. You
really don't have to use the freezer. they will set up setting out,
but look bvetter and set up faster in Frig or freezer. Good Luck and
Enjoy from Joni in S.Jersey. Jenilee and Scott loove to coat animal
crackers when they were little, I still do .yummmm.
