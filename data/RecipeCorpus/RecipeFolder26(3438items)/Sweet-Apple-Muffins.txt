Recipe by: From The Farmers' Market - ISBN 0-06-055005-8 1. Preheat
oven to 400Â°F. Generously butter a muffin tin and set aside. 2.
Resift the flour into a large mixing bowl with the sugar, baking
powder, baking soda, and salt. Make a well in the center. 3. In a
smaller mixing bowl, beat together the egg, egg yolk, buttermilk, and
vegetable oil until well blended. Stir in the grated apples; pour the
mixture into the well in the dry ingredients. 4. With a large wooden
spoon, combine the ingredients just until thoroughly moistened (the
mixture will still be lumpy; do not overmix). Spoon the batter into
the muffins tins; they should be quite full. 5. TOPPING: Stir
together the sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle this over the batter. 6.
Bake until the muffins have risen and are golden brown, about 25
mins. Turn out onto a wire rack and serve warm with sweet butter and
apple cider jelly.
