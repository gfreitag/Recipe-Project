Categories: Pancakes, Breakfast, Nuts/grains
Yield: 4 servings
2 T  Oil
2 T  Molasses
Add when mixing:
2 1/2 c  Water
1/2 c  Pecan halves
Pack for Topping when done:
1/2    Stick (1/8 lb.)butter
-(optional)
1/2    Pint Maple syrup
To pack, mix in a
-ziplock bag:
2 c  Buckwheat flour
2/3 c  Wheat flour
2/3 c  Instant dry milk
1/2 t  Salt
2 t  Baking powder
3 T  Dried egg (optional)
In an small, tight
-container:
This is a camping recipe. Assume moderate heat on a campfire or
packstove.

When ready to cook, mix all ingredients except the butter and syrup
and let set a couple minutes. If stiff, add a little more water. If
you heat the pan well first, no oil is necessary; however you will
need a good, flat metal spatula. If I have time, I plop 3 or 4 pecan
halves on each cake instead of mixing them in. Serve hot with butter
and syrup. Can be saved for later in the day; great with jam!

I use a metal camp plate and a plier-like pot-grabber as a griddle,
which is just right for my one burner stove. Baking the pancakes is
somewhat time consuming, but well worth it on a leisurely or cold
morning.
