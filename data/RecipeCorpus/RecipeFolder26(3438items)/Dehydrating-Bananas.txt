So sweet and versatile.  Stalk the markets for bargains of ripe and
'overripe' bananas.  When natural ripening has transformed hard to
digest starch into sweet natural sugar.  Banana garbains often occur
in winter so keep your dryer busy when local fruit is not available.
DRY when the bananas are beautifully spotted with brown. There are
several methods: 1 - Slice directly onto tray, no overlapping, and
let dry completely

before removing.  They may appear to stick, but when dry are easily
removed.  This method gives excellent color to the finished product.
2 - Dry peeled, whole bananas for a day.  Then stack several atonce
formass slicing.  This method seems to give chewier consistency to
banana bits. 3 - Banana sticks, are made by quartering a half banana,
the long way. These pieces dry the faste of all and do not stick when
laid on tray withcut side up. BANANA LEATHER: Absolutely no need to
ever waste another banana. Blend you very ripe banana in blender with
no added liquid.  A wedge of lemon with peel will give a special
flavor.  Pour onto leather trays and dry. VARIATIONS:  Throw in a
handful of walnuts at the very end of the blending process so that
will stay chunky as leather dries. Or, combine with any tart fruit -
apples, apricots, etc... Play around by adding different spices or
flavorings... vanilla, coriander. BANANA FREEZE CREME: Soak 4 oz
dried bananas in enough water to make 1-1/2 cups of bananas and
liquid. Blend soaked bananas and add 1/4 cup oil, 1 tsp vanilla and
1/4 cup honey. Blend thoroughly.  Add 1 cup walnuts and blend
briefly, leaving nuts chunky.  Serve as is, or soft freeze for a most
surprising, delicious, creamy, marshmallowy dessert. Origin: Dry It -
