Categories: Dessert, Fatfree
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 t  Finely minced fresh ginger
3 T  Cornstarch mixed with 3 T
-water
1    20-oz  can crushed pineapple

-used more)
Mix all ingredients in a saucepan.  Cook over moderate heat, stirring
constantly, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens.  Cool slightly

To gild the lily:

If you do make this into a pie, garnishing with sliced bananas glazed
with heated, strained apricot preserves makes it even more festive.

The cookbook I got this from is anything but vlf, but here goes (I
highly recommend it if, like me, you find making elaborate desserts
for non-vlf friends a relaxing and enjoyable thing to do every now
and then): Marlene Sororsky, _The Dessert Lovers Cookbook_, Harper
and Row, 1985.)
