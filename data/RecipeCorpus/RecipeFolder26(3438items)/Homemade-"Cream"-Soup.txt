Title: Homemade "Cream" Soup
Categories: Fatfree, Soup/stew
Yield: 1 servings
2 T  Dried onion flakes
1 t  Basil leaves
1 t  Thyme leaves
1/2 t  Pepper
2 c  Powdered nonfat milk
3/4 c  Cornstarch
1/4 c  (or less) instant chicken(or
Vegetable if you prefer)
Boullion
To use in place of canned cream soups in casseroles or as a base for
your own soups. Much lower in fat and salt than the canned versions.
The trick is to have it made up ready to use!

Combine all ingredients, mixing well.  Store in an airtight container
until ready to use.

To sustitute for one can of condensed soup: Combine 1/3 cup of dry
mix with 1 1/4 cups of cold water in saucepan. Cook and stir until
thickened. Add to casserole as you would the canned product. Makes
equivalent of 9 cans of soup.

I think you could probably vary the spices to suit your own taste or
the type of casserole you were making.

Makes 9 servings with less than 1 gram fat per serving.

Variations:

Mushroom Soup:  Add 1/2 C finely chopped mushrooms Celery Soup: Add
1/2 C minced celery Potato Soup: Add 1 C diced potatoes, cooked
Chicken Soup: Add 1/2 C diced chicken, cooked Vegetable Soup: Add 3/4
C mixed vegetables, cooked Broccoli Soup: Add 1 C chopped broccoli,
cooked Asparagus Soup: Add 1 C chopped asparagus, cooked

The variations are endless, limited only to your imagination.
