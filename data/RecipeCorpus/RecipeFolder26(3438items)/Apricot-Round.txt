Title: Apricot Round
Categories: Dessert, Fruit
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 c  Marg. or butter, diced
2/3 c  Milk
Milk for glazing
Margarine or butter, for
Greasing
1/2 c  Chopped dried apricots
2 c  All-purpose flour
1 tb Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cinnamon
1/2 c  Light brown sugar
Preheat the oven to 425.  Grease a cookie sheet. Sift the flour,
baking powder, salt and cinnamon into a bowl.  Stir in the sugar. Add
the margarine and cut it in until the mixture resembles fine bread
crumbs. Stir in the apricots.  Make a well in center. Add most of the
milk and mix it in with a round-bladed knife, adding the remaining
milk if necessary to give a soft, but not sticky dough. Gather the
dough together with your fingers, turn out onto a lightly floured
surface and knead about 10 times, until smooth. Shape into a ball,
then gently press out to a circle, about 1/2 inch thick. Place the
dough on the cookie sheet and brush the top with milk.  Using the
point of a floured knife, mark into 6 equal wedges. Bake in oven for
20-25 minutes, until well risen and browned. Cool then pull the
wedges apart and serve warm. Submitted By FLORENCE THOMPSON   On
