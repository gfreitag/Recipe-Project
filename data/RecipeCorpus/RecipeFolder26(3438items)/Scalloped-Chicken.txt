Categories: Chicken, Beans, Cheese/eggs, Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
2 c  Rice; cooked
8 oz Beans, green
1 c  Chicken, cooked
1    Eggs, hard-boiled
8 oz Cheese, cheddar
1/8 c  Butter
2 tb Cornstarch
1/4 c  Water
2 c  Stock, chicken
1 c  Bread crumbs
Melt butter in saucepan; dissolve cornstarch in water.  Add stock to
pan and bring to boil.  Stir in dissolved cornstarch and cook until
thickened, stirring frequently.  Peel and slice hard-boiled egg.

Spray casserole with nonstick cooking spray.  Layer 1/2 bread crumbs,
then 1/2 rice, then 1/2 green beans, then 1/2 chicken, then 1/2 egg,
then 1/2 cheese.  Repeat except for last layer of cheese.  Pour sauce
carefully over casserole ingredients, then top with remaining cheese.
May be refrigerated at this point up to 24 hours.

Preheat oven to 350; bake for 1 hour.  Or microwave on HIGH for 10
minutes.

Sylvia's comments: I was low on bread crumbs but had plenty of matzoh
meal, so used that.  I also didn't feel like messing with hardboiling
an egg, so I left it out.  And I made it last night to feed us
tonight, which is NOT in the original directions.  Nor is the nuking,
but I don't have time to bake something an hour when we get home from
work/school and I have two hungry kids wanting dinner RIGHT THEN!  I
think I should have mixed the bread crumbs into the sauce and topped
the first layer with 1/2 the sauce before repeating the layers; it
was quite difficult to get the sauce down into the casserole.  This
was NOT a hit with the kids. Peter said it was okay.
