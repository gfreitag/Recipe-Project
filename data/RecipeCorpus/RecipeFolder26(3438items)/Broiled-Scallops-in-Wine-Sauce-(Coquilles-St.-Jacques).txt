1    Bay leaf
1/2    Mild onion, chopped
1    Egg yolk
1/2 c  Heavy cream
1 t  Lemon juice
Salt/cayenne pepper to taste
1/2 c  Bread crumbs
1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese

1 lb Scallops
4 T  Butter
1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms
3 T  All purpose flour
1 c  Dry white wine
2/3 c  Water
2    Parsley sprigs

Heat one tablespoon butter in a heavy skillet and saute mushrooms.
Remove mushrooms and set aside. Add remaining 3 tablespoons butter
and 3 table- spoons flour and cook together over medium heat 2-3
minutes, stirring constantly.
Combine wine, water, parsley, peppercorns, thyme, bay leaf, onion,
and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil 10 minutes, strain
and return liquid to the pan; add scallops, cover and simmer 3
minutes. Remove scallops, cut into small pieces and set aside. Reduce
liquid to one cup; add butter-flour mixture and stir constantly with
a wire whisk until the mixture thickens and becomes smooth. Stir egg
yolk into cream, add a little hot sauce, stir into yolk mixture then
stir back into sauce and turn off heat. Stir in lemon juice, cayenne,
mushrooms and scallops. Divide into lightly greased scallop shells or
individual serving casserole dishes. Combine bread crumbs and cheese,
sprinkle over tops and dot with butter. Place on a broiler rack 4"
below heat source and broil 2-4 minutes or until the top is nicely
browned. Submitted By ART BARRON   On   12-30-94
