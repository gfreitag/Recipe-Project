Title: Biscuit Baking Mix
Categories: Bread, Mixes
Yield: 10 servings
1 tb Salt
2 c  Shortening
10 c  Flour
1/3 c  Baking Powder
This mix is used as the basis for several of the recipes in this
book. It keeps well in the pantry so it makes it easy to make
shortcake, bisuits or top off a casserole.

Sift dry ingredients together in a large bowl.  With two knives or a
pastry blender, add the shortening in spoonfuls and cut it in until
the mixture is the texture of coarse cornmeal.  If you are using a
food processor, start and stop it often during processing and watch
carefully.

Keep mix stored in a labeled, tightly closed container.  it will keep
onteh pantry shelf for 1 to 6 months in dry weather.  In hot or humid
weather, it's a good idea tp keep the mix in the fridge
