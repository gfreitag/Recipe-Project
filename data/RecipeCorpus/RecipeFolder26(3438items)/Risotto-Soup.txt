Title: Risotto Soup
Categories: Fatfree, Soup/stew, Rice, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
5 oz Frozen peas
5 oz Frozen green beans
15 oz Can of tomatoes, chopped
15 oz Can of corn
1 t  Cilantro
1 t  Fines herbes
Salt and pepper
4 c  Vegetable stock
1    Onion, chopped
4    Cloves garlic, chopped
1 1/4 c  Arborio rice
2    Carrots, chopped
2    Celery sticks, chopped
5 oz Frozen spinach, chopped
Saute the onion and garlic in a couple of tablespoons of vegetable
stock until the onion is translucent. Add the rice and brown for 3 -
5 minutes.

Add the carrots, celery, spinach, peas, and green beans. (Frozen stuff
still frozen.)  Cook on medium high heat, stirring occasionally, until
everything has defrosted and the rice has absorbed the liquid from the
vegetables.

Add 1 cup of the remaining vegetable stock and cook, stirring
occasionally, until the rice absorbs the stock. Repeat a cup at a
time with the rest of the stock.

Add the corn, tomatoes, and spices.  Cook until the liquid is mostly
absorbed.
