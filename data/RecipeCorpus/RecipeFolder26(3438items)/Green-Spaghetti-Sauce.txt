Title: Green Spaghetti Sauce
Categories: Fatfree, Pasta, Salsa/sauce, Vegetable
Yield: 2 servings
1    Clove garlic,
Crushed/minced
1/2 c  Plain soy milk/skim milk
x  Salt
1    16 oz bag frozen or fresh
Spinach
(or a combination
Frozen/fresh)
If using fresh spinach, wash and de-stem the leaves. Steam/microwave
the spinach until cooked.  Place it in a blender with the garlic and
milk. Whir until you have a nice sauce consistency. Start with less
milk if you like a thicker sauce, add more, as needed. It depends on
how much spinach "juice" you use.  Taste the sauce, and add salt, as
desired.

Serve on top of spaghetti or other pasta

Makes 2-3 servings, with pasta

NOTES: This makes a bright green sauce...kinda weird to look at but
very good tasting.  It's a real pretty presentation if you serve it
over spaghetti, half green, half tomato sauce.

It's especially good with Parmesan, if you are lacto-veg. Use fat
free, of course, or a tiny bit of "the good stuff".

DO NOT use vanilla flavored soy milk. I tried it. Yuk.
