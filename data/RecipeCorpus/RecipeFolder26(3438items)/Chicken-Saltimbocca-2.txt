1 T  Butter
2 T  Olive oil
1 md Shallot, minced
1/2 c  Dry white wine (about)
1/2 c  Chicken broth (about)
A pinch or two of dry sage
Pepper to taste
4 ea Chicken breast halves,
-lightly pounded to about
-1/4" thick
4 ea Fresh sage leaves
4 ea Thin slices prosciutto
4 ea Thin slices provolone cheese
All-purpose flour
Pepper (to taste)
Place 1 sage leaf on each piece of chicken, then a slice of
prosciutto and a slice of provolone. Fold chicken in half and secure
with toothpicks. (If the cheese sticks out of the bundles, I break it
off and place in the center before putting in the toothpicks). Coat
chicken breast halves with flour mixed with pepper (to taste),
shaking off excess flour. Heat butter and oil in skillet over medium
heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned on one side, then turn over
and lightly brown on the other side. Remove chicken to a plate. (It
doesn't need to be fully cooked at this point). Add shallot to the
pan and saute until translucent, but not browned. Raise heat to
medium-high and add wine and dry sage. Stir to loosen any browned
bits in the pan. Reduce by about half. Add chicken broth and chicken
bundles. Reduce heat to medium and cook until chicken is done. (Test
by piercing with a sharp knife- juices should be clear). Remove
chicken to a serving platter. If necessary, continue to reduce sauce-
there should be about 1/4 cup. Add pepper to taste, pour sauce over
chicken and serve. I usually serve this with linguine with a 4-cheese
sauce, or linguine with garlic, pine nuts and olive oil. FROM SALLIE
