Title: Stir-Frying Tips
Categories: Information, Chinese, Stir fry, Asian
Yield: 1 info  Stir-frying is a high speed Chinese cooking technique, excellent for
cooking seafood. The wok is the Asian cooking utensil of choice; it's
curved sloping sides and narrow bottom facilitate the stir-frying
process. Small pieces of fish and shellfish cook efficiently within 2
to 3 minutes. Little oil is required because of the wok's concave
shape. Among seafoods suggested for stir-frying are shrimp, squid cut
in rings, cubes of firm-textured fish and pieces of crab.

* It is crucial that all ingredients be prepared, measured and
arranged in containers on a tray before the cooking begins. There is
no time for preparation once the stir-fry process has begun.

* Be sure your wok is well seasoned. You will need less oil for
cooking and foods will not stick to the pan.

* Heat the wok before adding the oil, then roll the pan around so
that the oil coats the entire bottom. The wok and oil should be very
hot before the seafood is added.

* Stir rapidly and constantly with a Chinese stir-fry shovel to make
sure foods cook evenly. The shovel is specially designed to scoop and
toss foods with maximum efficiency and speed.

* Never stir-fry more than 1 pound of seafood at a time; cooking less
in 2 or 3 batches is better.
