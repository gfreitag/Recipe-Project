Categories: Middle east, Turkish, Appetizer, Meatballs
Yield: 16 meatballs
1/2 ts Black pepper; freshly ground
1 c  Olive oil; or vegetable oil
2    Egg; lightly beaten
1 lb Lamb, lean, ground; or beef
1/2 c  Onion; finely chopped
1/4 c  Long grain rice, raw
1 tb Salt
Combine the meat, onion, rice, salt and pepper in a deep bowl. with
a large spoon or your hands, mix the ingredients together and knead
vigorously until they are well blended.  A tablespoon at a time roll
the mixture into balls about 1 inch in diameter and shape them into
egglike ovals.  In a heavy 12 inch skillet, bring 2 cups of water to
a boil over high heat.  Add the meatballs and return the water to the
boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes,
adding boiling water if necessary to keep the balls covered. With a
slotted spoon, transfer the meatballs to a plate.
Pour the water from the skillet, add the oil in its place, and heat
over moderate heat until a light haze forms above it.  With tongs,
dip the balls in the eggs and drop them into the hot oil.  Fry the
meatballs over high heat for 5 to 8 minutes until they brown on all
sides. Drain on paper towels and serve.
