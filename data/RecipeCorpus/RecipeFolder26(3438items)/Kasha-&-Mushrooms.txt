Title: Kasha & Mushrooms
Categories: Fatfree, Nuts/grains, Mushroom
Yield: 2 servings
x  Garlic granules
x  Herbs
1 c  Kasha
1    Egg substitute
2 c  Water
2    Vegetable bouillon cube
1 cn Mushrooms and pieces
x  Onion flakes
Boil 2 cups of water in a small saucepan.  When it boils, add 1 veggie
bouillon cube (can't recall the brand, it comes 2 cubes in an adorable
little box for usually 99 cents a box at my HFS).  Add contents of one
small can of mushroom "stems and pieces" including the liquid. Add
some herbs to taste -- I threw in onion flakes, garlic granules, and
can't remember which green dried herbs.  Cover the pan so it doesn't
reduce too much -- you need 2 cups liquid to 1 cup kasha. (I didn't
add salt because the veggie cube has enough.)

While the broth is coming to a boil, put 1 cup of kasha (I like the
whole grains and also medium-cracked grains) in a larger saucepan
over medium heat.  Add 1 egg substitute (I use EnerG).  Stir well
over heat until the grains get dry again (the same as you probably
used to do with a real egg). Take the kasha pot off heat and hold it
away from yourself, and pour in the simmering flavored broth (it can
really spatter if you leave it over heat while adding the hot broth
to the hot kasha.) Stir once, put over low heat, and let it simmer
for about 15 minutes.

This makes a LOT, for those of you not familiar with kasha.  We had
this with a baked butternut (I think) squash and small green salads
for 3 adults and couldn't finish it, which was great as it provided
me with kasha leftovers to reheat for next day's (still delicious)
lunch, from just 1 cup of raw kasha.
