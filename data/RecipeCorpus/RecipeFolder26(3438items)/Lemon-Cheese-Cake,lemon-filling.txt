with milk. Beat batter for half minute.  Turn batter into two well
greased, lightly floured 9 inch round cake pans.  Bake in preheated
375 oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the

Directions for Lemon Cheese Filling:

Combine sugar, salt and cornstarch in top part of a one quart double
boiler.  Add egg yolks and mix well.  Stir in lemon juice.  Cover and
cook over simmering water for 20 minutes, or until mixture has
thickened, stirring frequently to prevent lumping.  Remove from heat
and stir in butter, vanilla and lemon rind.  Chill over ice water
until firm enough to spread.  Makes 1 1/4 cups or enough to spread
over the tops of two 9 inch cake layers.
