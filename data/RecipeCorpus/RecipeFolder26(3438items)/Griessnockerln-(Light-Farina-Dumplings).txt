Stir 1/2 cup farina and 1/2 teaspoon salt into 1/4 cup butter that
has been creamed with 2 eggs.  Set the mixture aside for 15 minutes.
Make a trial finger-shaped dumpling and lower it carefully into
simmering beef bouillon. If it falls apart, add 1 tablespoon farina
to the mixture; if it seems too solid, add 1 tablespoon milk.  The
dumplings should swell and rise to the surface.  Shape the rest of
the mixture into finger-shaped dumplings with slightly pointed ends.
Lower them into the simmering soup with a slotted spoon and simmer
them until they rise to the surface. From; GOURMET'S OLD VIENNA
