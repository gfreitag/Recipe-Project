Categories: Bread, Side dish, Sourdough
Yield: 1 servings
2 tb Baking powder
1 1/2 ts Salt
6    Toast slices; cut in cubes
2 c  Sourdough batter; proofed
1 c  Milk
3 lg Eggs
6 c  Flour, all-purpose
Recipe by: Randy Pollak In a very large mixing bowl combine flour,
baking powder, salt and toast cubes; mix well. In a medium bowl beat
eggs slightly; add sourdough batter and milk. Stir until well
combined. Pour batter mixture into flour mixture and mix dough until
smooth. Divide dough into four equal pieces and shape each piece into
small rectangular loaves. Set on wax paper, cover with plastic wrap
and then a dish towel. Allow dough to rest for at least 1 hour.
Prepare a large Dutch oven by placing a vegetable steamer inside and
add water until it comes to just below the steamer. Cover and bring
to boil. Reduce heat but it must be high enough to create steam.
Place 1 or 2 (depending on size as loaves will better than double in
size) loaves unto steamer and for about 20 minutes or until a
toothpick inserted into center of loaf comes out clean. Four loaves
is enough for about 12-16 servings. Note: Dumplings may also be
boiled, in which case you must cut each loaf in half; however
steaming produces larger and lighter dumplings. If you wish you may
refrigerate dumplings until cold carefully slice and wrap in plastic
wrap then foil and freeze.
