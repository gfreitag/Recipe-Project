Title: Ab Fab Artichoke Dip/Sandwich Filling (Ovo Lacto)
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Dip, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
1 lg Package of mushrooms,
Sliced
1/2 c  Or so f/f parmesan cheese
2    Spoonsfuls of f/f mayo and
F/f sour cream.
1 ds Worcestershireshshchestshire
(you know what I mean)
1 pk Frozen artichoke hearts
x  Italian herbs
x  Balsamic vinegar
x  1 t olive oil
1    Onion, chopped fine
3    Garlic cloves Peeled and
Squinched up into little
Pieces
Marinate artichoke hearts with italian herbs and some balsamic
vinegar. I myself add a teaspoon or so of olive oil (someone will be
coming to measure me now, I'm sure).

Stir artichoke hearts and rest of ingredients together. DON'T put in
so much white stuff that it is too moist because the mushrooms will
release moisture and then it will get gross.

Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes in a French White Corning Ware
casserole. If you put it in anything else it will explode.

This is great as a dip, or in a pita sandwich.  I hope you like it,
and I promise not to post too often until I actually learn to measure
and write :-)
