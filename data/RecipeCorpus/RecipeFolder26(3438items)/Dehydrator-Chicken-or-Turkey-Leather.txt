Title: Dehydrator Chicken or Turkey Leather
Categories: Can/preserv, Chicken, Turkey
Yield: 3 servings
No Ingredients Found
Carefully remove bones from leftover cookedchicken or turkey.  Avoid
using very fatty pieces, which make the leather too greasy.  Put the
bits andpieces of meat into blender, with enough liquid (chicken
stock, broth, and/or water) to blend.   Be sure to add any leftover
dressing. Season to your liking, but keep in mind it will get
stronger as it dries. Dry the same as you would for basic leather.
Cut into squares or tear off strips to eat.
