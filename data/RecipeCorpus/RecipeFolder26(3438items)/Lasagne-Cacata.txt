~--------------------------------------------------- It's a Sicilian
tradition to eat packaged pasta in a meat sauce on New Years Day.
This is a variation as I remember and have adapted it. The sauce is
almost brown which explains the name.
~----------------------------------------------------

* Use any one pound of meat (pork, veal, or *very lean* beef).

Saute the meat in the lard until cooked but not too browned.  Remove
from pot.  Add onion and saute over very low heat until golden, not
brown. Add tomato paste and wine, stirring well.  Add sauce, water
and bay leaf. Add meat and simmer for 1 hour or until meat is very
tender. Remove bay leaf and add salt and pepper to taste.

Cook pasta according to directions.  Put the fresh ricotta in a
large, deep serving dish.  Add a little hot pasta water to make a
sauce-like texture.

When pasta is done, drain and add to serving dish and mix with
ricotta.

Serve in individual bowls.  Top each bowl of pasta with a healthy
amount of the red sauce  and a lot of the grated cheese, and serve
with extra sauce and cheese so everyone can add more if they want
