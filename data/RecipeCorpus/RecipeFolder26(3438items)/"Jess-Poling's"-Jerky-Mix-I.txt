Choose any lean meat (I have used rump, London broil, clod). Clean
and cut out any fat, sinews, etc. that you can see.

Run through a meat grinder to grind into small pieces. Combine with
lean hamburger meat (22 to 30% lean if you can find it.) Add all
ingredients and mix very thoroughly.

If you have a jerky press, use that, if not, you may roll out on any
flat surface and cut into strips and lay on racks of dehydrator.

I use the 145 degree heat and dehydrate for 4 hours, then test. If not
dried to your liking, dry for another 1 to 2 hours and test again.

This recipe was made for approximately $2.50 a pound not including
spices. Where we shop, jerky sells for up to $1.99 for 1 to 1 1/2 oz.
of jerky.

Makes approximately 6 lb. of jerky
