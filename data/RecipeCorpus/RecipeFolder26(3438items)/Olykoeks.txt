milk, then cool to luke warm. Sprinkle yeast over lukewarm water to
dissolve. Sift together sugar, flour, salt, and cinnamon or nutmeg.
Combine milk and yeast in a large bowl. Stir in flour with your hands
(the dough will be very heavy), then stir in beaten eggs. Cover and
let rise in a warm place until double in size. Punch down the dough,
then work in the butter with your hands until the dough is smooth and
well blended. Roll about 1/2-inch thick on a lightly floured board
and cut with a doughnut cutter. Place doughnuts on a tray lined with
wax paper, cover again, and let rise in a warm place until light and
puffy. Drop several at a time into deep fat preheated to 375Â°F. Fry
until nicely browned on both sides. Lift from fat, drain on paper
towels, and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar, granulated sugar or a
mixture of granulated sugar and a little cinnamon. Makes about 40.
