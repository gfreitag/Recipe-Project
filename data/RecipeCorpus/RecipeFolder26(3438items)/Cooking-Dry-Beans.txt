Title: Cooking Dry Beans

This comes from Adele Davis' Let's Cook It Right:

Soaking legumes is unnecessary if the dry legume is quickly washed and
dropped into boiling water so slowly that boiling does not stop. As in
popping corn, the starch grains burst and break the outside covering
of the legume. After the covering and starch grains have burst, water
is absorbed rapidly and the cooking time is shortened. When all the
beans, lentils, or split peas have been put into the water, the heat
should be lowered immediately to prevent the protein from becoming
tough. A simmering temperature should then be maintained until the
beans are tender.

It works for me; I've found cooking times to be *significantly*
reduced.
