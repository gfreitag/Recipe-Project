bite-sized chunks over the pan (so that no juice is wasted).Coarsely
chop the other vegetables and herbs, and add to the pan. Bringto a
boil, lower the heat, cover, and simmer for about 1/2 hour. Uncover,
taste for salt, adjust the seasonings if necessary, and simmer for
another 15 minutes or so, or until the liquid has reduced and the
tomatoes have practically disintegrated. Put the whole mixture
through a sieve or food mill, or use it as it is if you wish. If the
sauce seems runny after being seived, return it to the heat and
simmer until further
