Categories: Casserole, Fish, Vegetable, Tomato
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
1/2 t  Dried thyme leaves
Salt to taste
1 sm Zucchini, scrubbed, sliced
1 c  Shredded monterey Jack
-cheese
1 md Tomato, chopped
2 cn Chunky style tuna (6-1/2 oz
-each)
6 oz Uncooked egg noodles (3
-cups)
1/2 c  Chopped celery
1/3 c  Sliced green onion
1/2 c  Dairy sour cream
2 t  Mustard
Drain and flake the tuna.  Cook the noodles.  Drain and rinse with hot
water.  Combine noodles with the tuna, celery and green onions.
Blend in the sour cream, mustard, mayonnaise, thyme and salt.  Spoon
half the noodle mixture into casserole dish.  Arrange sliced zucchini
slices over top. Spoon in remaining noodle mixture.  Arrange zucchini
over top. Cover with cheese.  Bake at 350F for 30 minute or until hot
and bubbly. Sprinkle with chopped tomato.

** MY NOTES **  I sprinkled the tomatoes on top of the top layer of
zucchini before sprinkling the cheese over top.  This also takes
longer than half an hour at 350F.  I tried it at 365F for 45 minutes,
and the zucchini was still not cooked...  maybe try thinner slices of
zucchini next time, or a hotter oven for a longer time....
