Title: Persimmon Jam
Categories: Can/preserv, Fruit
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Lemon juice
Shredded peel of one
-lemon
4    Ripe persimmons
2 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Grated pineapple
1.  Cut a cross in pointed ends of persimmons, peel off and discard
skin and stem.

2.  Combine persimmon pulp with sugar, cook over low heat 15 minutes,
stirring constantly until thickened and clear.  Do not boil.

3.  Stir in pineapple, lemon juice and rind.  Pour into warm
sterilized jars.  Seal when cool.  (I'd seal the little suckers while
the jam is still good and hot, ensures a better seal and much better
than using wax ,yuk. Submitted By ALAN BURGSTAHLER   On   01-10-95
