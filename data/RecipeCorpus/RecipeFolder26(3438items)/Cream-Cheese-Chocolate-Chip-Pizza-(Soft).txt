Title: Cream Cheese Chocolate Chip Pizza (Soft)
Categories: Cake/cookie, Dessert, Chocolate, Cheese/eggs, Pizza
Yield: 2 12" pizzas
2 1/4 c  All purpose flour
1 ts Baking soda
1/4 ts Salt
12 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
1 c  Chopped walnuts (0Optional)
1 c  Butter-margarine; softened
3/4 c  Sugar
3/4 c  Brown sugar
8 oz Cream cheese; softened
1 ts Vanilla
2    Eggs
Preheat oven to 375. Lightly grease two 12 inch pizza pans.  Cream
butter, sugars, cream cheese and vanilla in large bowl.  Add eggs,
beat until

light.
Combine flour, baking soda and salt in small bowl.  Add to creamed
mixture; blend well.  Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts (if used)
Divide dough in half, spread each half evenly into prepared pans.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT SPREAD ALL THE WAY TO EDGES, THIS DOUGH DOES SPREAD
Leave about a half inch space between edge of dough and rim of pizza
pan.

Bake 20 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool completely in
pans on wire racks.

To serve: cut into slim wedges.

Personal note:  When these were brown and ready to take out of the
oven they had a soft consistency - much like that of a soft batch
cookie. I wanted a firmer cookie.  Put them both back in the oven,
and turned the off.  Let sit for 1 hour hoping they then became more
like a chocolate chip cookie.  They never crisped up, but remained
soft. Still tasted good. == Courtesy of Dale & Gail Shipp, Columbia
