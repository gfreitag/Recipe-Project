Yield: 7 dozen

1/2 ts Ground allspice
2 c  Raisins

Most of the pueblos in New Mexico are relatively close to one
another. As I traveled throughout these pueblos I began to notice how
similar some of the recipes were that were being shared with me. I
then learned that many of the women bring prepared foods over to
other pueblos as an act of graciousness during Feast Days or other
celebrations. As a result, each pueblo has developed its own version
of certain recipes.

I learned this particular recipe from the women of the Tesuque Pueblo
just north of Santa Fe.  The recipe yields seven dozen cookies, and
if you choose, you can cut the recipe in half.  But I advise you to
bake the full amount.  The cookies are delicious and not too sweet
and will disappear faster than you could imagine. *****

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease a large cookie sheet.

In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and shortening.  Add the
pumpkin, eggs, and vanilla and beat until smooth.

In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and
allspice.

Slowly add the dry ingredients to the pumpkin mixture, small amounts
at a time, until completely mi8xed together.  Stir in the raisins and
walnuts.

Drop tablespoonfuls of the dough roughly 2 inches apart on the cookie
sheet.  Bake 12 to 15 minutes, until golden brown.
