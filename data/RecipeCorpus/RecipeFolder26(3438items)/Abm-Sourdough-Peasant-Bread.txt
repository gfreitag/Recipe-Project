This is for the medium sized loaf which, depending on how active my
starter is at the moment, will rise to the top of my Hitachi B101.

If I want an extra sour loaf, I will use the starter two or three days
after feeding. This produces a shorter loaf with a heavier texture.

For a light and fluffy loaf, I feed the starter first, then let it
sit on the counter for 8 to 10 hours before using. I make sure it is
very foamy when I put it in the B/M.

the cycle, but I was wrong and ended up with some outside the crust.
Nonetheless, this baked up nice and golden with a great sourdough
taste. It needs to really cool before you can lice it, because it's
so airy. The crust is like tempura. A lovely bread. I know it's just
white bread, but it has a great taste.  BTW, I didn't use a newly fed
starter. Had to be 4 days.  Starter being what it is, it may never
turn out this way again.
