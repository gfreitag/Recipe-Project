Title: Eggplant Dal Sauce
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Indian, Fatfree
Yield: 4 servings
1 t  Cumin
1    Cinnamon stick
1    Dried red chili
-cayenne pepper to taste
-salt to taste
1 md Eggplant
2/3 c  Red lentils
2 c  Water
2 t  Black mustard seeds
1 t  Coriander
Roast the eggplant in a 400-degree oven for an hour (stab it first
with a fork).  A half hour or twenty minutes before you anticipate
the eggplant will be done, pop the mustard seeds in a medium sized
saucepan, then add lentils, water and spices.  Bring to a boil and
gently simmer until the eggplant is finished cooking, then remove
eggplant from oven, slit open, scoop out innards, chop them coarsely
and add to lentils.  Cook another 5-10 minutes to blend all the
flavors.  This would probably make a respectable soup if it were
thinned out with more water and broth, but I served it over...

> Kirsten, your recipe for eggplant dal sounds delicious, but would
you explain > how to "pop" mustard seeds? Also, you call for black
mustard seed ~ how is > that different in flavor from regular mustard
seed? Do you find them at your > HFS, or do normal grocery stores
carry them? > I pop the seeds by putting them in a heavy wok with a
lid.  I spray a little bit of Pam first.  The brown or black mustard
seeds can usually be gotten at a HFS or an Indian grocery store.
These are the only kinds of seeds I have ever tasted so I can't
comment on whether the flavor is different but they add substantially
to the flavor of an Indian type dish.
