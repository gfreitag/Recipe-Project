1/2 c  White vinegar
1/2 c  To 1 cup ketsup

Mix all the ingredients in a pot and bring to a simmering boil. Add
the ribs coating and turning often until the sauce is reduced and
slightly thickened. Now you can either place all the ribs in micro
dish and pour on the sauce and micro for 10 to 20 minutes or until
glazed and tender. Or you can place on grill with low heat and keep
brushing on the sauce and grill until all is glazed and tender.
Watch it so they do not burn. You can adjust the sweetness, by adding
more honey or molasses. It is your choice. Enjoy! Cheryl MM Format
