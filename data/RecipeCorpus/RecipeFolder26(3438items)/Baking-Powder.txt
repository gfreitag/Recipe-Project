Perhaps you recall from your high-school or college chemistry class
experiments that carbon dioxide bubbles are generated whenever water
is poured over a dry acid and alkali mixture.  That's exactly what
happens when you use baking powder, because this cooking ingredient
is essentially a blend of acid (calcium acid phosphate, sodium
aluminum sulfate, or cream of tartar, to name three) and alkali
(sodium bicarbonate, popularly known as baking soda).  Add water to
this mixture and a chemical reaction results, producing carbon
dioxide.  The gas generated creates minuscule air pockets, or enters
into existing ones, within the dough or batter. When placed in a hot
oven or on a hot griddle, the dough or batter rises, primarily for
two reasons.  First, the heat helps release additional carbon dioxide
from the baking powder. Second, the heat expands the trapped carbon
dioxide gas and air and creates steam. The resulting pressure swells
the countless air pockets, which in turn expands the food being baked.

Test:  You can easily determine whether you need a fresh supply by
conducting this simple chemical experiment.  Pour one quarter cup of
hot tap water over one-half tsp. of baking powder.  The fresher the
baking powder, the more actively this mixture will bubble.  If the
reaction is weak or does not occur, your baking powder will not
properly raise whatever you are baking. Make Your Own: For 1 tsp.=
1/2 tsp. of cream of tartar, 1/4 tsp. of baking soda and++if you plan
to store your supply++1/4 tsp. of cornstarch.  The Cornstarch absorbs
moisture.  Work quickly with homemade, because the carbon dioxide is
released more quickly and at a lower temperature than commercial.
