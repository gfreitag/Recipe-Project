MEXICAN STEAK
Ingredints are meat,
I take the meat, chuck roast sliced 1/2 inch thick, round steak, or
what ever.  I sprinkle lemon pepper and meat tenderizer over the meat
and pound it into the meat.  I brown the meat in an electric skillet
and remove it. Then I slice tomatoes, and onions and layer them in
the skillet. Tomatoes, Onions and Meat.  On top I layer over sliced
canned chilles. (I use Orega brand.)  This is not the origiginal but
something I have played around with.  This is an idea that calles for
experimentation, rabbit, moose, veal etc. The choice of peppers to go
on top can range from Anaheim to Habanero, canned and otherwise.  The
only caveat is that the tomatoes need to go on the bottom, and it
needs to be coverd becaus the moisture in the tomatoes helps make the
meat tender.  Howard arten, are you listening? Bill
