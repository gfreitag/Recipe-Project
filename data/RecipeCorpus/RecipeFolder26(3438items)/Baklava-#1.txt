Title: Baklava #1
Categories: Nuts/grains, Dessert, Pastry
Yield: 1 servings
- not ground
1 lb Almonds; chopped fine
- not ground
1 ts Nutmeg
1 c  Salted butter
1 c  Honey
1/2 c  Sweet butter; melted
1    Box phyllo dough
1 lb Walnuts; chopped fine
Heat regular (salted) butter with honey until mixture bubbles. Set
aside about 1/8 of it. In a bowl, combine buts and nutmeg. Pour
remaining 7/8 of honey syrup over nut mixture to moisten.

Lay phyllo dough on cutting board lengthwise. Brush one layer at a
time with melted sweet butter (unsalted) until you have 3 layers.
Line up a 1/4-inch wide wide strip of nut mix along edge of dough
about 1/4 inch thick. Pick up that edge and roll dough into a
cylinder with nut mix in the center. Cut each cylinder into 8 pieces
and place in 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Repeat until all nut mix and
phyllo dough are used.

Bake at 350 degrees until golden brown, about 10-20 minutes. Warm
leftover syrup and spoon on top. Let cool before serving.

If you cannot locate phyllo dough, use pie crust recipe, roll dough
very thin, and use only one layer of dough instead of three.
