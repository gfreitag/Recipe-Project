If you don't have the traditional paella pan, a shallow, heavy, large
skillet can be used.  Wash chicken and dry with paper towel.  Saute
in hot olive oil for a few minutes and remove to a pot with 4 cups of
water. Boil chicken for 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, in the same skillet,
fry the onions and bell peppers.  Add tomato.  Meanwhile rinse the
seafood. Add the seafood to the skillet with onions, bell pepper and
tomato. Cut pimentos into strips and add half to skillet along with
the peas. Mash garlic, parsley and salt together with the back of a
wooden spoon and add to pan. Add the saffron, then the chicken, rice
and sausage. Cover with 4 cups boiling chicken broth.  Stir gently to
distribute ingredients evenly. Bring to a boil for five minutes; then
reduce heat to medium and continue cooking until rice is tender and
dry and grains are separated, about 20 to 30 minutes. Do no stir
during cooking. When done adjust seasoning and add red pepper if you
wish. Garnish with remaining pimento strips and lemon wedges.  Serve
from pan. Serves six.
