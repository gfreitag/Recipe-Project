Categories: Fatfree, Beans, Pasta
Yield: 1 servings
2 t  Basil
1/2 t  Salt
1/2 t  Pepper
1/2 c  Corn
2 T  Tomato Puree/Paste
12    Sheets Spinach lasagna
1/4 c  Water
2 T  Flour
3/4 c  Soya milk
1    Clove Garlic
1/4 t  Salt
1/4 t  Pepper
3 T  Yeast flakes
1/4 t  Turmeric
1 lg Onion, sliced finely
3    Cloves Garlic, minced
1    Red chili, deseeded
2    Stalks Celery, chopped
*very* finely (because my
Wife hates it)
1/2 c  Water
1 lb Broccoli
1 sm Courgette/Zucchini
1/2 lb Mushroom
1 pt Vegetable Stock (Vecon and
Water)
1 c  Red lentils
1 cn Tomatoes
2 t  Oregano
Steam onions, garlic, chilli and celery in the half cup of water. Add
stalks of the broccoli, the courgette and the mushrooms and simmer for
about five minutes. Add the stock, the canned tomatoes, the herbs,
salt and pepper, the lentils and the broccoli flowerets. Simmer till
the lentils are tender. Add the corn and the tomato puree. The
resulting mixture should be fairly sloppy still because it has to go
into the oven for 20 minutes.

In another pan stir the flour into the cold 1/4 cup of water till a
paste is made. Put on the heat and slowly add the soya milk making
sure to avoid lumps. Add the crushed clove of garlic, some salt and
pepper, the yeast flakes and the turmeric. You should end up with a
pourable cheeze sauce.

Layer the mixture with the lasagna sheets (I used no-boil spinach
lasagna) finishing with a layer of lasagna sheets. Cover with the
cheeze sauce and stick in the oven at about 170 deg. C (330 deg. F)
for 20 minutes. Eat with a salad.
