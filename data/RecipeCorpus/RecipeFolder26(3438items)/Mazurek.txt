Cream butter in a bowl. Add melted chocolate and sugar; mix well.
Stir in eggs, one at a time; mix well. Stir in vanilla, salt and
milk. Gradually add flour; mix well. Spread evenly in a greased
shallow pan, 15 x 10 x 1 inch; bake in a preheated moderate oven
(350Â°F.) about 20 mins, or until cooked. Cut into pieces, each 2 x 2
inches, and decorated each piece with white frosting and chopped
nuts. Makes about 25.

NOTES : In the Polish cuisine there are several recipes for a type of
cake
that, because it is thin and chewy, is more like a cookie. One
kind is made with ground nuts and another includes flour. The
toppings or fillings might be nuts, cherries, apples, raisins,
dates or candied fruits. This is one good example.
