Categories: Fatfree, Beans, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
Packed type), drained
1 cn Tomato paste (the small
Kind)
1    To 2 Tablespoons soy sauce
x  Cumin, Thyme, Cayenne pepper
(to taste, I used about
1 t  Each.
1    Green or red pepper, seeded
And chopped
1    Onion (I used red) chopped
1    To 4 Garlic Cloves minced
1    Jalapeno pepper (optional)
2 cn Black beans, drained
1 cn Corn kernals (the vacuum
Saute vegetables in balsamic vinegar with the spices until soft and
onion is clear.  Add rest of the ingredients, stir up and cook till
warm. (I used a 12 in. nonstick skillet and it was full to the top!)
Should be thick, not liquid.

Spoon into ff flour tortillas , roll up, and bake for 10-15 minutes.

I had some steamed kale left over and rolled it up with the filling
interesting addition, I liked it!  I also added some ff soyakass
jalepeno "cheese"

Warning!  This makes a lot!  I ate 2 each evening for 5 days, and
still had filling left over to freeze.  It freezes well.  Also, when
cold, I just microwaved for 2-3 minutes (with a damp paper towel to
keep the tortillas from getting tough), and that worked fine, too.  I
did not use a jalepeno in my version, just personal taste.
Obviously, I liked them a lot to eat so many days in a row, but they
were easy to fix! Hope you all like 'em. Yum!--
