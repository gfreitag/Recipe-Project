Sprinkle or crumble yeast into a large bowl. Add water. Use slightly
warmer water for dry yeast. After a min. or two, stir to dissolve.
Heat 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup milk in a saucepan. Remove from
stove and leave until butter melts. Add sugar, salt and eggs; add to
yeast. Mix well. Gradually stir in enough flour to make a stiff
dough; beat well. Knead on a floured board until smooth and elastic.
Form into a ball and put in a greased bowl. Turn over once. Cover
with a cloth and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk, about
1 1/2 hours. Punch down and turn out on a floured board. Cut off
small pieces and shape with floured hands into balls about 2 inches
in diameter. Arrange on a large plate and cover. Let rise until
double in bulk. Melt remaining 1/2 cup of butter in a large skillet
or heavy casserole. Add remaining 1/2 cup of milk; heat. Arrange
dumplings, one next to another, in the skillet. Cook over low heat,
covered, until all liquid has evaporated and butter crackles, about
30 mins. The dumplings should have a crisp golden crust. Serve with
stewed fruit or a sweet sauce. Makes about 12.
