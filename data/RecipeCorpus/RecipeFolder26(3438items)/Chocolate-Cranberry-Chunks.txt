9-inch square pan with foil so that all sides are covered. Press foil
until smooth. Set aside. 2. Place the cranberries and the sugar in a
heavy saucepan and stir gently over medium-high heat for 6 mins.
Remove from heat. 3. Place the cream in a heavy saucepan and bring
almost to a boil over medium heat. Place the saucepan in a large
skillet of simmering water and add the chopped chocolate. Stir over
simmering water until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove from
heat and stir in the cranberries, nuts, and raisins. 4. Pour the
chocolate mixture into the foil-lined pan and cool completely on a
wire rack. Chill briefly, until firm but not hard. Inverting the pan
over a sheet of wax paper, use the foil to remove the block of
chocolate from the pan. Gently lift off the foil. Cut the mixture
into 1 1/2-inch squares; if you like, place the candies in small
paper candy cups. Serve at cool room temperature.

NOTES : Remember the Chunky---as in "What a chunk-a-chocolate"? Here,
the
rich chocolate chunks are filled with raisins, nuts, and
cranberries, which burst with tart flavor as you bite in.
Cranberries and chocolate are a surprisingly successful flavor
combination.
