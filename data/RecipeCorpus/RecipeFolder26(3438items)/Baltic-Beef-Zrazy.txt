Have butcher cut meat into long thin slics and pound with a meat
cleaver to make as thin as possible. (Some markets sell meat already
cut for roulades). Trim to make pieces uniform size. Season with salt
and pepper. Saute onion with bacon until onion is tender. Pout off
all fat except for 2 Tbs. Add mushrooms and saute for 4 mins. Remove
from stove. Soak bread in bouillon to cover and squeeze dry. Add with
egg to onion-mushroom mixture. Mix in egg and season with salt and
pepper. Place a spoonful of bread stuffing on each slice of beefand
roll up. Tuck in meat edges to completely enclose stuffing; fasten
with toothpicks or tie with thread. Dust roulades with flour and
brown in fat. Add bouillon to cover and cook slowly, covered, about
50 mins, or until tender. Remove roulades to a warm plate and keep
warm. Scrape drippings and stir in sour cream. Leave on stove long
enough to heat through. Pour sour cream sauce over roulades and
sprinkle with the dill or parsley. Serves 4 to 6.

NOTES:  Stuffed roulades of beef, prepared in several variations, are
popular meat dishes in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
