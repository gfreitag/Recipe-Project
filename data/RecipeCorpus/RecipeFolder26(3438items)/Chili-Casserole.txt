Title: Chili Casserole
Categories: Fatfree, Chili, Cheese/eggs, Casserole
Yield: 1 servings
9 oz Ff, grated cheese
6 oz Bag ff, baked corn chips
2    16oz cans S&W Chili Makin's
(or any other premade, ff,
Veg chili)
Simply layer the chili, then chips, then cheese. (Usually good for two
layers :)  Heat in oven at 350 or 375 until cheese is melted and
chili is warm. Serve with additional corn chips if desired.

(Since so many ppl seem to be confirmed SAD and/or m**t eaters, I
often add one box/package prepared Heartline Meatless Meats to the
chili before layering. It has fooled everyone to date with no
complaints :)
