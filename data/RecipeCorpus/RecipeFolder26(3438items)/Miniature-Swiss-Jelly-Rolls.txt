Title: Miniature Swiss Jelly Rolls
Categories: Cake/cookie, Fruit, Dessert
Yield: 16 slices
Confectioners' Sugar
2/3 c  Blackberry Jam
Fresh Blackberries
Pesticide-Free Rose Petals
1 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1/2 ts Baking Powder
4    Eggs
1/2 c  Superfine Sugar
1 tb Water
Preheat oven to 425øF. Line bottom of a 15x10x1" jelly-roll pan with
parchment paper. Butter parchment. Sift flour and baking powder into a
small bowl. Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs and sugar at high speed until thick
and creamy, about 5 minutes. Gradually sprinkle flour mixture over
egg mixture, then fold in gently. Be sure there are no dry pockets of
flour. Fold in water.

Pour batter into pan. Spread evenly, smoothing top. Bake at 425øF for
10 minutes until center springs back when lightly touched. While cake
is baking, sprinkle a 20" long sheet of parchment paper with sifted
confectioners' sugar.

Remove cake from oven and immediately run knife around edge of cake to
loosen, then invert hot cake on sugared paper. Peel off baking
parchment from bottom of cake. Trim off crusty edges with a sharp
knife. Cut both cake and parchment in half crosswise. Gently roll up
each hot cake in parchment starting from narrow end. Wrap in clean,
warm, damp cloth. Cool on rack.

Before serving, gently unroll cakes. Spread each cake with half the
jam, leaving a 1" border on all sides. Roll up starting at narrow
end. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Cut each cake in 8-10
slices. Garnish with berries and rose petals.
