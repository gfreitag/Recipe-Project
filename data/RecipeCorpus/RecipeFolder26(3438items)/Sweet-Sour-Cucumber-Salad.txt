Title: Sweet-Sour Cucumber Salad
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Salad
Yield: 1 servings
1/3 c  White vinegar
3    Cucumbers
1/3 c  Salt
You take the cukes, peel them and then thinly slice them on a grater
or a Mouli.  Layer these in a colander and sprinkle salt on each
layer. Let these sit at least 1/2 hour so they wilt. Thoroughly wash
off the salt. Meanwhile, mix white vinegar in about equal proportions
with sugar. Toss the cucumbers with this and chill.  You may need to
adjust the ratio to your personal taste.

For a salad of 3 cucumbers, I'd maybe use 1/4- 1/3 c. each of vinegar
and sugar.

You could add dill seed to this, but I prefer it plain.
