BEEF STOCK: In a heay 6- to 8-qt pot, bring the lb. of beef, beef
bones and 4 qts of water to a boil over high heat, skimming off any
foam and scum as they rise to the surface. Add the onion, carrot,
tied greens and salt, partially cover and reduce the heat to low.
Simmer 1 to 1 1/2 hrs, or until the meat is tender but not falling
apart. Remove meat with a slotted spoon, cut it into small dice and
set dice aside. Continue to simmer, partially covered for about 4 hrs
longer. Then strain through a fine sieve set over a large bowl,
discarding the bones and greens, With a large spoon, skim off and
discard as much of the fat as you can.

SOUP: Melt the butter in a 3- to 4-qt pot set over high heat. Add the
onions, reduce the heat to moderate, and cook 8 to 10 mins, or until
they are soft but not brown. Stir in the shredded cabbage & the
celery and parsley roots, cover the pot, and simmer over low heat for
15 mins. Pour in the meat stock and add the reserved diced beef.
Simmer over moderate heat (partially covered) for 20 mins, then add
diced potatoes. Cook another 20 mins and stir in the chopped
tomatoes. Cook 10 mins longer, then add the salt and a few grindings
of pepper. Taste for seasoning. Serve hot.
