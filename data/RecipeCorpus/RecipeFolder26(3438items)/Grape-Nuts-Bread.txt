raisins at the beep or appropriate time for your machine. CYCLE:
white, sweet; timer SETTING: light to medium

NOTES : If your machine has difficulty baking properly with the large
amount of raisins, cut them in half. Some people reported that
Grape Nuts scratched their pans. The testers did not have any
problems, so be warned. Remember that these pans are designed
for
nuts and other hard foods. Add the Grape Nuts in the order
given
or for DAK/Welbilt owners, put the flour in and then the Grape
Nuts. Adjust water or flour if necessary.
