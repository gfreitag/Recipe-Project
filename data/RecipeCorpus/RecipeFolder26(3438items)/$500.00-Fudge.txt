18 oz Chocolate chips
3 tb Vanilla
Dash salt
4 1/2 c  Sugar
1 lg Can evaporated milk
1 c  Butter
Cook sugar and canned milk to rolling boil for 6 minutes; Stirring
constantly. Use large stainless steel pot; remove from heat. Add
butter, chocolate chips, vanilla, and dash of salt

Stit until mixed. Pour into buttered pan.  Let stand 6 hours before
cutting.  Will keep a long time in cookie tin or a sealed container
in a cool place.

* The original recipe calls for 1/2 lb butter, but I find that the
butter "pools" on top of the finished fudge. I only use 12 T of
butter and my fudge turns out fine!
