Title: The Seafood Pantry
Categories: Information, Seafood
Yield: 1 info  A world of flavor possibilities is as close as your kitchen pantry.
Here are some things you'll want to keep on hand.

From the Fridge:
green onion: milder than yellow onions; good in stir-fries or
sprinkled over fish for garnish (wrap a bunch of green onions
in lightly dampened paper towels and put them in an open
:
:
:
plastic bag
they will stay crisp for up to a week)
fresh ginger: a little goes a long way; use in stir-fries or
marinades (ground ginger is not a suitable substitute)
olives: standard black, Greek, green, whichever you prefer
capers: add to a vinaigrette sauce or marinade; great with
:
:
:
:
:
fish
plain nonfat yogurt: can make a quick, low-fat sauce with
:
chopped
herbs, lemon juice, salt and pepper
Parmesan cheese: use in breadcrumb coatings or, of course,
:
:
tossed
with seafood pasta
frozen vegetables: peas, corn, spinach, carrots; a quick thaw
:
:
and
they're ready to use in stir-fries, pasta, soups
:

Some Basics:
lemons and limes: freshly squeezed juice and grated zest do
:
wonders
for seafood
herbs: parsley, thyme, basil, oregano, rosemary, chives,
:
:
cilantro,
dill, tarragon; use fresh when available (if you have a sunny
windowsill, balcony or patio spot, think about getting an
:
:
herb kit
to start your own herb garden)
garlic: few recipes would not benefit from this ubiquitous
seasoning
yellow onion: great all-purpose ingredient; stronger flavor
:
:
:
:
when
quickly cooked, becomes sweeter with long cooking
shallots: onion cousin; more pronounced, less sweet than
:
:
yellow
onions
broth: canned vegetable, chicken or fish bouillon cubes
:
:
(preferably
Knorr); multi-purpose for soups, sauces, etc.
canned whole tomatoes (low-salt if possible): very acceptable
replacement for vine-ripened tomatoes
rice: long-grain white and brown are all-purpose; short-grain
Arborio for risotto; aromatic basmati or jasmin delicious with
seafood
dried pastas: choose a variety of shapes ÄÄ penne, angel hair,
fusilli, spaghetti, bowtie, shells, etc.; different flavors,
:
:
:
:
:
:
:
:
too
help add variety
fine yellow cornmeal: to coat fish for frying
white flour: for dredging fish
dried hot pepper flakes: to add a quick sprinkle of fire for
:
:
:
:
those
who love it
curry powder: highly aromatic and exquisite with seafood
:
:

From the Bottle:
olive oil: for sauting, in marinades and sauces; save fruity
extra-virgin for flavoring rather than cooking
corn or peanut oil: all-purpose, but best for high-temperature
stir-frying and deep frying
canola, safflower or other vegetable oils: for
:
:
:
:
:
general-purpose uses
vinegars: have a few favorites on hand ÄÄ red wine, herbed
:
white
wine, balsamic, fruit, rice wine, etc.; make a quick
:
vinaigrette
sauce for cooked fish
red pepper sauce: Tabasco is the long-time favorite but many
:
:
brands
are available
dry white wine: adds a splash of moisture and flavor to
:
:
sauts and
soups
soy sauce: consider low-sodium "lite" varieties; also "light"
:
:
which
has milder flavor and lighter color
sesame oil: use as flavoring, especially in stir-fries; not
:
:
for
cooking
Worcestershire sauce: consider white Worcestershire, made
especially for seafood, but traditional dark good with
:
:
:
flavorful
fish (salmon, tuna, swordfish)
:

Off-the-Shelf:
teriyaki sauce: now widely available in many brands
general seafood marinades: many now available, but all are not
created equal; try a few to find your own favorite; a good
Italian-style salad dressing works well too, or a simple
:
:
:
:
homemade
vinaigrette with herbs
jerk sauce or seasoning: either liquid-based or dry "jerk" has
pungent flavors of allspice, peppers, cinnamon, garlic; ideal
:
:
:
on
full-flavored fish
:

Upscale Flavors:
dried mushrooms (shiitake, porcini, morels): plumped in
:
water; a
flavorful addition to stir-fry or saut
sun-dried tomatoes: plumped in water and diced for sauce,
:
:
marinade
or simple seasoning
marinated artichoke hearts: chop and toss with cooked shrimp
:
:
in
pasta ÄÄ magnificent
