Title: Ethiopian Curried Butter
Categories: Condiment, African, Curries, Spread
Yield: 2 cups
2 ts Cumin seeds
1 tb Basil; minced
1 ts Cardamon seeds
1 tb Fresh oregano
1/2 ts Turmeric
1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
2    Cloves
1    3" piece ginger
-peeled and grated
1/2    Onion; minced
1    Garlic clove
-peeled and minced
2 lb Butter
1    2" piece cinnamon
1 tb Fenugreek seeds
Combine ginger, onion, and garlic, and pound to a coarse paste with a
mortar and pestle. Set aside.

Melt the butter over low heat, stirring constantly, taking care that
it does not darken. Skim off the foam as it rises and continue
cooking until all the foam is gone.

Add the paste and all remaining ingredients to the butter and simmer,
uncovered, at the lowest possible heat, stirring occasionally, for 30
minutes.

Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Pour off the transparent top
layer and reserve it, leaving behind as much of the milk solids and
spices as possible. Strain the transparent layer through several
layers of cheesecloth. The butter will usually be an oil at room
temperature and will solidify in the refrigerator, where it can be
kept, covered, for 3 or 4 months.
