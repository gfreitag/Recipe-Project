Original Poster's Note: Here's one I"ve been tinkering with for
several months now. I'm eating a warm slice right now and it's GREAT!
:)  The ripe bananas eliminate the need for any sugar or oil. This
makes a very tasty loaf that is excellent toasted in the morning or
eaten straight out of the bread machine late at night. Hey, I think
this may even qualify as healthy stuff.
