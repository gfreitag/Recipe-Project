Title: Dugun Corbasi (Wedding Soup)
Categories: Middle east, Turkish, Soup/stew, Veal
Yield: 8 servings
Black pepper; freshly ground
3    Egg yolk
2 tb Lemon juice, fresh
2 tb Butter; melted
1/4 ts Paprika
1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
2 tb Mint, fresh; finely cut or
;1 tablespoon of dried mint
6 tb Butter; cut into 1/4 inch
;bits and clarified
1 lb Veal, lean, boneless; or
;lamb, preferably from the
;leg, cut into 1/4 inch dice
1/4 c  Flour
5 c  Water
1 sm Onion; peeled
1 ts Salt
In a heavy 3 to 4 quart casserole, heat the butter over moderate
heat until a drop of water flicked into it sputters instantly.  Add
the meat and brown it, tossing the pieces about with a spoon and
regulating the heat so that they color deeply and evenly with out
burning. Stir in the flour, and cook until the flour colors lightly.
Pour in the water and, still stirring, bring to a boil over high
heat. Add the onion, salt and a few grindings of pepper, reduce the
heat to low, and simmer partially covered for 30 minutes, or until
the veal is tender. Discard the onion.
In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks with a whisk or rotary beater
until they thicken slightly.  Add the lemon juice, then beat in about
1/4 cup of the simmering soup.  Pour the mixture into the casserole,
stirring constantly, and simmer until the soup thickens enough to
coat the spoon heavily.  Do not let it come to a boil.  Remove the
soup from the heat, cover tightly and let it stand at room
temperature for 4 or 5 minutes.
Just before serving, combine the melted butter, paprika and
cinnamon and stir them into the soup.  Taste for seasoning.  Ladle
the soup into a heated tureen or individual soup bowls and garnish
with mint.
