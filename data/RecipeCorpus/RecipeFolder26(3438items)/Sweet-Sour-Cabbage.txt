Remove any wilted outer leaves from cabbage. Cut out core and shred
leaves. Put leaves in a bowl or colander and prinkle with salt. Leave
for 1 hour. Squeeze out all liquid. Put cabbage in a saucepan and add
remaining ingredients. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Lower
heat and cook slowly, covered, for 30 mins, or until tender. Serves 4
to 6. NOTE: The dish may be thickened with flour, if desired.

NOTES : Green, red and Savoy cabbage are used extensively in the
Polish
cuisine, and the cooks have devised innovative methods for
cooking
them. This is a characteristic preparation.
