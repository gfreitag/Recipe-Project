Title: Lentil And Leek Risotto [t]
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Beans, Rice
Yield: 2 servings
x  Salt and pepper to taste
1 T  Approx. chopped fresh basil
Or a pinch dried basil
1 c  Cooked lentils
1/4 c  Freshly chopped parsley
1/4 c  Finely grated carrots
4    Chopped leeks (green and
White parts, well washed)
4    Cloves garlic, minced
1    Red pepper, finely chopped
3 c  Vegetable broth or water
1 1/4 c  Brown rice
In a 4 quart deep pot with cover, saute leeks, garlic and red pepper
in a small amount of the broth.  When soft, add the rest of the broth
or water, and stir in rice along with seasonings. Reduce heat and
simmer covered for about 40 minutes or until rice is done. Uncover,
stir in cooked lentils and reheat until lentils are hot. Garnish with
parsley and grated carrot before serving.

*I deleted 1T of olive oil for sauteing, so the nutritional
information of 368 total calories and 6g of fat is off by whatever 1T
olive oil accounts for.
I also changed 1 clove garlic to 4, and 2 leeks to 4. It was too
mild for me in it's original incarnation. I also liked it better with
basmati brown rice, though the dish then became a pseudorisotto in
texture.

Delicious and easy if you keep cooked lentils around!
