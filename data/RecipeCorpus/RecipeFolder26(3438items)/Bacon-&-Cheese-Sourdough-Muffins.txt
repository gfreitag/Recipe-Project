1/2 c  Sourdough starter
2/3 c  Milk

4 sl Bacon

aside. Preheat oven to 400~F.  In a large bowl, sitr together flour,
baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar.  Stir in cheese; set
aside. In a medium bowl, beat egg.  Stir in sourdough starter, milk
and oil or drippings. Add to flour mixture.  Stir with fork until dry
ingredients are just moistened. Fold in crumbled bacon.  Fill
prepared muffin cups 2/3 to 3/4 full with batter. Bake in preheated
oven 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from muffin cups.
Serve hot.

Great for breakfast with a glass of orange juice!  These turned out
absolutely WONDERFUL.  I would suggest greasing the muffin tins very
well. The cheese tends to make them stick a little!
