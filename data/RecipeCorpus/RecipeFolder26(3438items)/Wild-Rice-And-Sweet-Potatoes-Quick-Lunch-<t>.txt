Title: Wild Rice And Sweet Potatoes Quick Lunch <t>
Categories: Fatfree, Rice, Sweetpotato
Yield: 1 servings
1    To 2 T fresh chopped
Parsley
x  Salt to taste. (I put quite
A bit for this dish.)
1 c  Cooked Wild Rice
1 c  Cooked Basmati Rice
1    To 2 uncooked sweet
Potatoes, cut into 1/2 inch
Pieces
Fill into plastic lunch box. Mix for cooking. Nuke for 10 minutes on
high.

Note: This can also be made using a pre-cooked sweet potato. Then the
nuke time is reduced to 3 minutes for reheating.

Variation: I think this would be good with a couple of table spoons of
orange juice for extra flavoring added before cooking.
