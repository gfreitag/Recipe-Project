Categories: Appetizer, Asian, Pork
Yield: 1 servings
2 pn Five-spice powder *
1 pk Wonton wrappers *
1 ea Egg, beaten
3 c  Vegetable oil (OR canola
-oil)
1/2 lb Lean ground pork
1 ea Onion, chopped

Brown the ground pork in a skillet and drain the oil.  Mix the meat
with the chopped onion, oyster sauce, sesame oil, sugar, white pepper
and five-spice powder.  Mix well.

Separate the wonton wrappers. Moisten the edge of a wrapper with
beaten egg. Place a teaspoon of the filling mixture in the center of
the wrapper and fold the wrapper in half to form a triangle.  Make
sure the air bubbles have been pressed out and the edges are sealed.
Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling mixture.

Deep fry in vegetable oil at high temperature until golden brown,
being careful not to overcook or they will turn into blackened
chunks. Serve as appetizers with a sweet and sour sauce of your
choice.

Makes about 20.
