*
1    Egg
1/2 c  Dried cherries OR:
- golden raisins
*
Icing Recipe -
1 1/2 c  Confectioners' (10X) Sugar
2 tb To 3 T Milk
*
1 pk Active dry yeast
1/3 c  Sugar
2/3 c  Warm (105ø-115ø) water
1 c  Toasted, skinned hazelnuts*
3 c  Bread flour OR:
-  all-purpose flour
1 ts Salt
1/4 c  Unsalted butter, at room
1.  Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in lukewarm water.  Let stand
until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes.

2.  Place half of hazelnuts in food processor.  Whirl until chopped;
remove and reserve.  Place remaining nuts in food processor along
with the remaining sugar.  Whirl until finely ground.  Add flour,
salt, and butter to processor.  With machine running, add the egg and
the yeast mixture. Whirl until mixture forms a ball; whirl 30 seconds
more to knead.

3.  Transfer dough to a large greased bowl; turn to coat.  Cover with
a damp cloth.  Let rise in a warm place, away from drafts, until
doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

4.  Punch down dough. On a lightly floured surface, knead in
remaining nuts and the cherries or raisins.

5.  Divide the dough in half.  Roll each half into a 24-inch-long
rope. Twist the ropes together.  On a greased baking sheet, form the
braided loaf into a candy-cane shape.  Cover with a damp cloth.  Let
rise in a warm place, away from drafts, until doubled in bulk, about
1 hour.

6.  Preheat oven to 350ø.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until golden
brown and hollow sounding when tapped.  Cool on a wire rack.

7.  To prepare icing; stir together 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1 to 2
tablespoons milk until blended and a good icing consistency.  Divide
icing in half. Tint half with red food coloring.  Drizzle or pipe red
and white icing in candy-cane stripes over bread.

* NOTE:  To toast hazelnuts, spread nuts out on baking sheet.  Bake in
preheated 350ø oven for 8 to 10 minutes.  Rub nuts with a clean
kitchen towel to remove the skins.
