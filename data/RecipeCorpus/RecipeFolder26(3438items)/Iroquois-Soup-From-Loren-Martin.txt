The Iroquois were blessed with clear, cool lakes and sparkling
streams, and both served up an abundance of fish.  Fish soup, or
u'nega'gei, as the Iroquois called it, was a favorite.  One early
recipe is described, "Fish of any kind is boiled in a pot with a
quantity of water. It is then removed and coarse corn siftings
stirred in to make a soup of suitable consistency."  When wild onions
and greens were available, they were usually tossed into the soup
pot, adding both color and flavor.
