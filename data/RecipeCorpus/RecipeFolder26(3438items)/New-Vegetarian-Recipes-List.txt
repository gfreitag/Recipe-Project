Title: New Vegetarian Recipes List
Categories: Fatfree
Yield: 1 servings
None
I was requested to post information about a new unmoderated list
"solely for the posting of vegetarian recipes, wines and cooking
hints." I know we do a lot of that here, but this one is not merely
"fatfree"-focused. To subscribe to the list, email to:
emailurl@flevel.demon.co.uk

In the message:  subscibe veg <you@your.domain>
end

After you receive acknowledgment of your enrolment on the list, you
may post messages at: veg@flevel.demon.co.uk

Questions may be directed to: veglist@flevel.demon.co.uk or:
david@flevel.demon.co.uk

He will be trying it for a month, and if the volume warrants, he will
continue the list.
