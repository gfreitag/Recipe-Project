Title: Black-Eye Peas And Rice (T)
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Rice
Yield: 3 servings
1    15 oz can Black Eye Peas,
Drained
2 c  Cooked white rice
x  Salt, pepper, garlic powder
For seasoning
1    Onion
x  Water/broth for saute
1    15 oz can peeled tomatoes,
Drained
Or equivalent amount of
Fresh tomatoes (~1.5 cups)
Chop the onion and saute it in a good size frying pan with the broth.
If you are using fresh tomatoes, add them and cook until they are
soft. Stir in the remaining ingredients and heat through.

Makes about 3-4 servings, as a main course casserole

NOTES: Don't drain the tomatoes and black-eyes completely. You need a
little "juice" to make it a nice mushy (comforting) casserole.

I really liked it with a generous amount of pepper.

This recipe was from a TV program here in Raleigh NC called "Southern
Sportsman".  I just took out the oil and bacon. I thought it was
pretty funny to find a healthy recipe (with modifications) off a TV
show that talks about hunting and shooting and fishing (and
eating..frying...the "catch"...yuk). Guess this recipe is for the
days when the rabbits, deer, ducks, and trout are smarter!!
