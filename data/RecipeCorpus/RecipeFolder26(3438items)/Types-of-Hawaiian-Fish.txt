number 1 or sashimi grade and is prized for its flavor and
texture. Opah (moonfish)
This "good luck fish" was never sold by old-time Hawaiian
fishermen, they always gave it away. Opah have four colors of
flesh; orange behind the head and along the backbone, pink along
the belly, red in the cheeks and a bright ruby red inside the
breastplate. Tombo (albacore tuna)
Popular for broiling, tombo is the lightest and mildest of the
tunas. Care must be taken not to overcook this lean fish.
