Title: Broccoli Calzone
Categories: Italian, Pizza, Pie/tart, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
-tsp dried minced garlic
1    Egg, beaten with 1 tblsp
-water
1    16 oz jar spaghetti sauce (I
-use more than that)
-parmesan cheese
1 lb Bread or pizza dough
10 oz Pkg frozen chopped broccoli
-(thawed and well drained)
1 c  (8 oz) ricotta cheese
1 c  (4 oz) mozzarella cheese
-(shredded)
1    Clove garlic (minced) or 1/8
If you use frozen dough, let it thaw and rise according to package

directions.If store bought, let it come to room temperature.

Combine broccoli, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and garlic.

Punch down dough and turn out onto lightly floured surface.  Divide
into 4 equal pieces.  One at a time, roll out each piece into an 8"
circle, leaving a 1" border.  Fold dough over to cover filling,
forming a semi-circle.  Press and crimp the edges with fork tines to
seal. Brush with egg mixture.  Place on greased baking sheet and bake
at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until brown & puffed.

Transfer to rack and let cool 10 minutes.  Top with hot spaghetti
sauce and sprinkle with parmesan cheese.

Hint: DON'T prepare this ahead of time and refrigerate until it's
time to cook.  The dough won't rise properly. Trust me, I did it
tonight.

I added some sausage (fried and drained) tonight.  It gave it a nice
flavor. From: April Bowman-Fox Date: 15 Apr 94
