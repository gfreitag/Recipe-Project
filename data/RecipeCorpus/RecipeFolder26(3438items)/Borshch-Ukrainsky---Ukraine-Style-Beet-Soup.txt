Drop the tomatoes into boiling water for 15 seconds. Run them under
cold water and peel them. Cut out the stem, then slice them in half
crosswise. Squeeze the halves gently to remove the juices and seeds
then chop them coarsely and set aside. In a 10- to 12-inch skillet or
casserole, melt the butter over moderate heat, Add the onions and
garlic and, stirring frequently, cook 6 to 8 mins, or until they are
soft and lightly colored. Stir in the beets, celery root, parsley
root, parsnip, half the tomatoes, the sugar, vinegar, salt and 1 1/2
cups of the stock. Bring to a boil over high heat, then partially
cover the pot and lower the heat. Simmer for 40 mins. Meahwhile, pour
the remaining stock into a 6- 8-qt casserole and add the potatoes and
cabbage. Bring to a boil, then simmer partially covered for 20 mins,
or until the potatoes are tender but not falling apart. When the
vegetable mixture has cooked its allotted time, add it to the
casserole with the remaining tomatoes and the meat. Simmer partially
covered for 10 to 15 mins, until the borshch is heated. Taste for
seasoning. Pour into a tureen, sprinkle with parsley and serve
accompanied by sour cream.
