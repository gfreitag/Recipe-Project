Recipe by: From The Farmers' Market - ISBN 0-06-055005-8 1. Bring a
large pot of water to a boil. On a lightly floured surface, roll out
the pastry in a large rectanglar shape about 1/8-inch thick. Fit it
into a buttered 9 x 13-inch rectangular baking pan, covering the
bottom and sides of the pan with the pastry, with a slight overhang.
Fold in the overhanging edges and flute the border. Place the pan in
the freezer or refrigerator while you prepare the filling. 2. Preheat
oven to 375Â°F. Blanch the nectarines for about 15 seconds. With a
slotted skimmer or spoon, transfer them to a colander and refresh
under cold running water. Slip off the skins with a paring knife.
Slice the nectarines about 1/2 inch thick, letting them fall into a
mixing bowl and discard the stones ( you should have about 6 cups
sliced peeled nectarines). Toss the nectarines with the blueberries
and lemon juice. 3. In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, tapioca,
cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Toss this mixture with the fruit; aet
aside. 4. TOPPING: In a food processor or large mixing bowl, cut
together the flour, brown sugar, salt, and butter until very coarsely
crumbled. Stir in the chopped almonds. 5. ASSEMBLY: Scatter half the
bread crumbs over the pastry-lined baking dish; the crumbs will
absorb excess fruit juices. Pour the fruit mixture over evenly.
Sprinkle the fruit with the remaining bread crumbs; then scatter the
topping mixture on top. 6. Bake until golden brown and bubbly, about
50 mins. Cool briefly on a wire rack, then serve warm, passing a
pitcher of cream, if you like.

NOTES : This cobbler is unusual in that it has a bottom crust, and is
topped with a crumbly nut streusel instead of biscuit dough.
The
bread crumbs keep the buttery crust crisp. It can be made with
a
combination of any fresh fruits.
To make half a recipe, serving 6 to 8, halve all the
ingredients,
and bake it in an 8-inch square pan.
