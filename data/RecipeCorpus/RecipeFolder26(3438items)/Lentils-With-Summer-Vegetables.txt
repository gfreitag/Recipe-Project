Title: Lentils With Summer Vegetables
Categories: Fatfree, Beans, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
1    1 1/2 tsp summer savory
x  Black pepper
x  Dried garlic  [I'm out of
Fresh :-( ]
1    Bay leaf
5 c  Water (or use part broth if
You want)
2 c  Lentils (any color), rinsed
And drained
1 md Onion, chopped
2 md Carrots, chopped
2    Stalks celery, chopped
1 md Zucchini, quartered and
Sliced
Put everything in a large pot, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and
simmer about 30-40 minutes.  Remove bay leaf.  Serve over brown rice
(or maybe potatoes). Makes 4 reasonably sized servings.

The vegetables used were the ones I happened to have on hand.  Vary
to suit yourself.  Leeks are great in this.  If I want this to be
more soup-like, I add more water and a can of tomatoes, pureed.  I've
also put potatoes in the pot with the rest of the veggies.  The
possibilities are endless...
