Title: Marinade Ideas
Categories: Information, Marinade
Yield: 1 servings  Try using Allegro Marinade. It's available in most grocery stores,
comes in two or three different "flavors" and is easy! I usually just
put the meat that I wish to marinate in a ziploc bag with enough
Allegro to cover it (the meat), close it up, and stick it in the
fridge for an hour or two. I like to do this in the morning before I
go to work, 'cause the meat is perfectly marinated & tenderized when
I get home. Putting the meat in a bag with the marinade is also good
for camping - just put it in the cooler! Also, I'll add chunky-cut
vegetables to this mixture for added zing on shish-kebabs. Allegro
has worked on just about everything I've tried it on - venison, lamb,
beef, and even the occasional chicken.
