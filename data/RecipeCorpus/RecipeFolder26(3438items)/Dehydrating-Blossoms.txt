Blossoms from the gardenwich land in our salads have included cabbage,
parsley, celery and radish flowers.  Violets and wild pansies make
delicious and beautiful salad fare.  Loveliest fresh, of course, but
the dried blooms add their subtle nutrients to winter time salads,
too. Origin: Dry It - You'll Like It!  circa 1973. Shared by: Sharon
