oven to 450Â°F. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to a
large round about 13 inches in diameter and 1/8 inch thick. Trim off
excess dough, forming a neat circle (Chill excess and reserve for
another use). Transfer the dough to a 12-inch pizza pan or a heavy
baking sheet. Gently fold the edges of the dough over onto the
surface of the circle to form a neat border. 2. Arrange the apple
slices over the dough in concentric circles, overlapping them
slightly. In a small cup or bowl, toss together the sugar, cinnamon,
and nutmeg; sprinkle this mixture over the apples. 3. STREUSEL: In a
mixing bowl or food processor, combine the flour, brown sugar, and
butter until crumbled to the size of large peas. Scatter the streusel
mixture over the apples. 4. Bake the pizza until the apples are
lightly golden and the pastry is crisp, 20 to 25 mins. Scatter the
grated cheese over the apples and bake until the cheese just begins
to melt, about 1 min longer. Serve hot, cut into wedges.
