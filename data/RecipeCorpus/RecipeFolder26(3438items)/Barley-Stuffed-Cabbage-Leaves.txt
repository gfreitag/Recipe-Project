Cook barley in water to cover for 1 hour or until tender, or
according to package directions. Pull of and discard any wilted or
coarse outer cabbage leaves. Cut out core to a depth of about 3
inches. Parboil cabbage in a large kettle of salted boiling water for
about 15 mins, or until leaves are soft enough to be pliable.
Carefully cut out the tough part of the rib from each leaf. Saute
onion in shortening until soft. Add mushrooms and lemon juice; saute
3 mins. Season with paprika, salt and pepper. Add cooked barley and
parsley and mix well. Spoon 1 or more large spoonfuls of stuffing
onto each leaf, the exact amount depending on the leaf's size. Roll
up and fold in edges to securely enclose stuffing. Secure with
toothpicks or tie with string. Place in a kettle. Cover with bouillon
and cook slowly, covered, about 1 1/2 hours, or until leaves are
tender. Remove stuffed leaves and keep warm. Stir flour into
drippings and cook, stirring, until smooth. Add sour cream and dill
and heat through. Pour sauce over stuffed leaves. Serves 8 to 10.

NOTES : Polish stuffed cabbage leaves or "birds," called golabki, can
be
filled with flavorful combinations made with barley or rice and
mushrooms, or meat and rice. Very often golabki are served
with a
mushroom or sour cream sauce. This is an interesting variation
that can also be prepared with pickled cabbage leaves, if
desired.
