Title: Tofu "Ranch" Dip
Categories: Fatfree, Dip, Appetizer
Yield: 1 servings
To make it creamier
1 pk Hidden Valley Salad
Dressing
2 pk Mori-nu silken Tofu
1/4 c  Apple cider vinegar
x  A little water if necessary
I have served this at parties, and no one seemed to be aware that it
wasn't REAL Ranch dip ; )

Tastes just like I remember.  Vegans beware, I think that I remember
that there was some kind of milk by-product like whey or something in
it, but if you avoid dairy for allergies, it doesn't seem to bother
mine YMMV.
