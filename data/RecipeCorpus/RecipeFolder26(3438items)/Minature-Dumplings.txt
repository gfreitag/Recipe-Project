Combine ingredients, adding enough water to form a stiff dough. Beat
several times. On a wet chopping board, smooth out 1/2 of dough until
very thin. Cut off small pieces of dough with a wet knife. Drop into
a kettle of salted boiling water; cook until noodles rise to the top,
about 5 mins. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain. Proceed with
remaining portion of dough. Serve at once or saute in melted butter
before serving. Serves 4 to 6.

NOTES : One of the most popular German forms of pasta is the tiny
Spatzle,
which means literally "tiny sparrows". It is considered both a
dumpling and a noodle. Although native to Swabia in West
Germany,
Spatzle are also favorites in the eastern regions. Spatzle are
served in soups and as accompaniments to meats, poultry, game
or
stews. This basic recipe may be flavored with minced cooked
ham,
spinach or cheese, if desired.
