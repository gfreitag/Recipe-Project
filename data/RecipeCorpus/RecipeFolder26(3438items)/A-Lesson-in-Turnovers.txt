Fruit turnovers are simple yet wonderful pastries that capture the
great flavors of so many late harvest fruits such as apples and
pears. Turnovers are fuller in flavor than their first cousins, pies,
because the samller size of the pastry allows hotter internal cooking
temperatures. This better caramelizes flavors from the fruit. Use the
best fruit available.

Cut firmer fruits into smaller, thinner pieces that will com;letey
cook through in the shorter turnover cooking time.  Tender, moist
fruit may be cut in larger pieces to preven them turning to mush.
Use berries whole. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%% CHOOSE YOUR
CRUST %%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PIE CRUST DOUGH: is the
standard and works well as a turnover.  The scrap raw pie crust dough
left over in the making of the pie is a perfect candidate. SWEET OR
ENRICHED PIE CRUST: such as sour cream crust, buttermilk crust, nut
flour crust and even flavored crusts will add another dimension of
taste. PHYLLO DOUGH: is a natural for a super thin layered and flaky
pastry. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%% FILLING %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Roll the pastry out and cut into 6 inch
squares.  Combine fruits with sugar, spices and, if necessary, cookie
crumbs to firm up the filling. Position a couple of spoonfuls of the
mixture in the center of the square. Brush the edges of the pastry
with an egg and cream mixture, fold over to make a triangle, and
seal. Cut a tiny vent into the top with a simple snip of the pastry
scissors. Brush the top with the egg and cream mixture. You may
sprinkle the top with coarse sugar for eye and palate appeal. If
you've done all the steps right, just sit back and let the turnovers
brown. When they're done, transfer them to a cake rack to cool at
least to room temperature. Bake the turnovers half of the cooking
time of the bottom rack of the oven to insure a crisp lower crust and
maximum heat penetration to the filling. Move the turnovers to the
top rack to brown the top crust and ensure even cooking. Lots of
fruit flavors are complimentary to each other, so mix tree fruit and
berries for some especially great combinations. Jimmy Schmidt is the
