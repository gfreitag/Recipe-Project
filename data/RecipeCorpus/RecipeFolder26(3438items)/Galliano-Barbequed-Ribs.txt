Categories: Main dish, Bbq/grill, Pork
Yield: 3 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
3 ea To 4 lbs. pork back ribs
MMMMM---------------------GALLIANO BBQ SAUCE--------------------------
1 ea Clove garlick, chopped fine
1 c  Hickory-flavored BBQ sauce
2 T  Light corn syrup
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
1 sm Onion, chopped fine
1/4 c  Galliano
1 T  Lemon juice
Cut the ribs into 3-bone sections.  Put them into a pot of boiling
*salted* water and boil for about 20 minutes. Mix all the sauce
ingredients together in a medium-sized bowl. Preheat an ove to 350
degrees. Remove the ribs from the water and place them on a baking
sheet, meat side up and baste with the barbecue sauce  Bake for about
25 minutes.  Turn the ribs and bake again. Bake for another 25
minutes.  Turn the ribs again, baste and bake for 5 minutes. Or,  if
you have an outdoor barbecue-er,  you can use that instead of an oven
- it's actually tastier that way.
