Recipe by: Fannie Flagg's Original Whistle Stop Cafe Cookbook Place
chicken in a heavy 2 1/2-qt saucepan. Add 6 cups water, and stir in
salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer 45
mins to 1 hr, or until very tender. Remove chicken from broth; let
cool. Remove chicken from bones and dice. Add milk and margarine to
broth; bring to a simmer. Cut shortening into flour using a pastry
blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 1/2 cup water and
stir with a fork just until dough leaves side of bowl. For rolled
dumplings, roll out dough to 1/8-inch thickness on a lightly floured
surface; cut into 4- x 1/2-inch strips or 2-inch squares. For drop
dumplings, pat dough to 1/2-inch thickness on a lightly floured
surface; pinch off dough in 1 1/2-inch pieces. Gradually drop
dumplings, one at a time, into boiling broth mixture. Cover, reduce
heat, and boil gently for 15 mins, or until dumplings are cooked.
Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Stir in chicken and heat
through.

NOTES : These dumplings are light and fluffy. If you want your sauce
to be
thicker, like gravy, stir 2 Tbs flour into 1/4 cup milk until
smooth, then stir into the simmering broth and stir until
thickened.
