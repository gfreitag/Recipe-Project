Title: Joni's Coconut Eggs
Categories: Candy, Holiday, Chocolate
Yield: 24 servings
1/2 c  Butter;soft
1/8 ts Salt
2 lb Dark chocolate;melted
2 lb 10x sugar
14 oz Coconut,flaked
1 ts Vanilla
Mix all the ingred's until soft, if sticky add more sugar. Make into
logs, or small footballs. I like them small, but you can make them
any size you want. Even make into large egg shape, for decorating.
Place on wax paper on cookie sheet. and chill. In mean time melt
chocolate coating, and dip the eggs in the chololate and put in the
freezer for a few minutes, makes them shiny. I also use white
chocolate and color it pink and green, real light colors for easter.
Then you can make some of mixture in small balls and coat like a
BonBon. Yummmy. I use the Dark Chocolate for the coconut eggs, as
they are on the sweet side. Enjoy Joni in S.Jersey Ruth from PA
