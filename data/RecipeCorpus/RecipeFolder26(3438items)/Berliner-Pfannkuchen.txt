Sprinkle or crumble yeast into a large bowl. Add 1/4 cup of lukewarm
milk. Use very warm milk for active dry yeast and lukwarm for
compressed yeast. After a minute or two, stir to dissolve. Add melted
butter, sugar, eggs (one at a time, beating after each addition),
lemon rind and salt. Gradually add enough flour to make a soft dough;
beat well after each addition. Form into a ball and put in a greased
bowl. Turn over so top of dough is greased. Place in a warm place and
let rise, covered, until doubled in bulk. Turn out on a floured board
and knead well. Roll out to a 1/4-inch thickness; cut into rounds
with a 3-inch cookie cutter or glass. Place a small amount of plum or
apricot preserves in center of half the rounds. Moisten edges with
egg white or water; top with other rounds of dough. Press firmly
together to completely enclose preserves. Arrange on a large cookie
sheet; put in a warm place, covered, until large and light. Drop into
a kettle of hot deep fat (370Â° on a frying thermometer) and cook
until golden brown on both sides, only a few mins. Revoce with a
slotted spoon and drain. Serve warm, sprinkled with confectioners'
sugar. Makes about 30.
