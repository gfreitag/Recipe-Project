In shallow dish, mix marinade ingredients.  Add chicken, turning to
coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight. In large skillet, melt 3 Tbsp
butter and saute peppers for 2 minutes. Remove peppers; reserve. Stir
in wine and chicken broth. Increase heat to high and boil until sauce
is reduced to 2 tablespoons, about 5 minutes.  Add cream and cook
until sauce is reduced by half, about 4 minutes.  In another skillet,
saute mushrooms in 2 Tbsp butter over medium-high heat until slightly
browned. Add peppers, cream sauce and salt. Drain chicken, discarding
marinade. Broil chicken 4 inches from heat, turning once, cooking
until tender and juices run clear. (Chicken may also be grilled.)
Discard skin and cut chicken into 1/2-inch strips. Stir Parmesan and
1/4 cup basil into heated pepper sauce. On heated platter, arrange
chicken attractively on top of warm fettucine and pour sauce over top
to cover.  Serve immediately. Creme de Colorado Cookbook (1987) From
