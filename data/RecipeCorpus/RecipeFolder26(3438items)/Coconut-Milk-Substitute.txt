Title: Coconut Milk Substitute
Categories: Curries, Nuts/grains, Beverage
Yield: 1 cup
-OR evaporated skim milk
1/2 ts Coconut extract
1 c  Milk (whole or low-fat)
-OR yogurt
Combine the ingredients in a bowl and stir.

Note: combining coconut extract with whole milk reduces the level of
fat to 8 grams; when combined with low-fat milk, that figure is
reduced to 5 grams. Since the consistency of coconut-flavored milk is
thinner than that of canned coconut milk, you may need to add more of
the substitute than is called for in the recipe and cook it longer to
achieve good results. Yogurt combined with coconut extract will be
thicker and the fat content will be even lower, about 3 grams.
Evaporated skim milk will also give a thicker consistency.
