Put flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of
mixture and add eggs. Stir in enough water to make a stiff dough.
Knead on a floured board. Shape into a ball and let stand 1 hr. Roll
out very thin on floured board. Cut into small rounds, about 4 inches
in diameter. Place 1 spoonful of the fruit filling on the lower half
of each circle. Brush edges with egg white, slightly beaten. Flood
pastry over to form a half-circle, and press edges together. Drop, a
few at a time, into a large kettle of boiling water and cook briskly
for 15 to 20 mins., or until dumplings come to the surface. Remove
with a slotted spoon and drain. Serve warm. Serve with warm cherry
juice and thick cream, if desired. Makes about 16.

FRUIT FILLING:

Put cherries and sugar in a small saucepan and simmer for 5 mins.
Cool.

NOTES:  Ukrainian dumplings called varenky, which are prepared and
