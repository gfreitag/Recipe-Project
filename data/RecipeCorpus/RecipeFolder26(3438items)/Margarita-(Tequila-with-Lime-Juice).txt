Title: Margarita (Tequila with Lime Juice)
Categories: Tex/mexican, Beverage, Alcohol, Fruit
Yield: 1 cocktail
1/2 oz Triple Sec
4    Ice cubes
1 4oz. tumbler or cocktail
Glass, chilled
1    Lime slice
Coarse (Kosher) salt
1/2 oz Lime juice; fresh
1 1/2 oz Tequila
Rub the inside rim of the chilled tumbler or cocktail glass with the
slice of lime. Pour salt into a saucer or cup and dip in the glass so
that a thin layer of salt adheres to the moistened rim.
Combine the lime juice, tequila, Triple Sec and ice cubes in a
mixing glass and place a bar shaker on top.  Grasping the glass and
shaker firmly together with both hands, shake them vigorously 9 or 10
times. Remove the shaker, place a strainer on top of the mixing
glass, and pour the Margarita into the salt-rimmed tumbler or
cocktail glass.
