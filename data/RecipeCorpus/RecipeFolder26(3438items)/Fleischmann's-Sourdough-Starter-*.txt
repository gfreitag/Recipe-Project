Categories: Bread, Breadmaker, Sourdough
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM----------------------PATTI - VDRJ67A---------------------------
2 1/4 ts Bread machine yeast -=OR=-
1 pk Active dry or rapid yeast
2 c  Water; lukewarm (105-115~)
3 1/2 c  All purpose flour
In large 2 quart container, combine flour and yeast. Gradually add
water and beat until smooth. Cover loosely; let stand in warm place
until bubbly and sour smelling, about 2-4 days. Trasfer to 2 quart or
larger plastic container with tight fitting lid. Refrigerate until
ready to use.

TO KEEP STARTER ALIVE: Once a week, stir in 1 tbls flour and 1 tbls
lukewarm water. Beat until smooth. Cover loosely and let stand until
bubbly, 12-24 hours. Cover tightly; refrigerate until ready to use.

TO REPLENISH STARTER: For each 3/4 cup (1-1/4 cup) used, add 2/3 cup
(1 cup) flour and 2/3 cup (1 cup) lukewarm water. Beat until smooth.
Cover loosely and let stand until bubbly, 12-24 hours. Use or cover
tightly and refrigerate until ready to use.

SOURDOUGH TIPS: The sourdough starter should be the consistency of
thin pancake batter; if needed, add enough water to get desired
consistency before using. To assure accuracy, measure the starter
while it is still chilled, then let it come to room temperature
before using. It expands when warm.
