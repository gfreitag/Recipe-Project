Grain wafers can be varied surprisingly with different techniques.
The great texture difference between a cornapple crisp and a
cornapple chew is achieved by the grinding the sweet corn for one,
and soaking and blending the same dried corn for the other.  Both are
great. CUTTING CRISPY CRUNCHY WAFERS:  Can be difficult.  We
generally just break them into pieces, but if you like squares, cut
them while dry enough to hold their shape, but not so crisp they'll
crumble.  Use a cutting board and a sharp knife. Then return the
squares to the dryer until crisp as desired.

STORE: you crackers, wafers, etc in airtight containers as with
anything you want to keep crisp. RECRISPING: If any of your beautiful
crispies, granola, wafers, chips, whatever, should be left out or
improperly stored and lose their crunch, simply return them to your
dryer until the old snap comes back. Obviously, this will work with
anything that needs crisping, whether your own or a commercial
variety. Origin: Dry It - You'll Like It! circa 1973. Shared by:
