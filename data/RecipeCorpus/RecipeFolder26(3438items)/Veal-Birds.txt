stir well.  Spoon 1 heaping tablespoon of the mixture onto each piece
of veal. Beginning at the narrow end, roll up jelly-roll fashion and
secure with wooden picks.  Dredge the veal rolls in the flour,
turning to coat evenly, and shake off the excess. Coat a large
nonstick skillet with cooking spray and melt the margarine in it over
medium heat. Add the veal rolls and cook, turning frequently, until
lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set
aside.  Wipe the drippings from the skillet with paper towels.  Add
the lemon juice, broth and 1/4 cup of wine to the skillet and bring
to a boil.  Return the veal rolls to the skillet and top with the
mushrooms.  Cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes or
until the veal is tender.  Remove the veal rolls from the skillet;
remove and discard the wooden picks.  Cover and keep warm. Add the
quartered artichoke hearts to the skillet.  Combine the cornstarch
and water; stir well, and add to the skillet.  Bring to a boil and
cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute or until the sauce is
thickened and bubbly. Pour the sauce over the veal rolls, garnish
with thin lemon slices, and serve. Makes 8 servings (2 veal rolls and
