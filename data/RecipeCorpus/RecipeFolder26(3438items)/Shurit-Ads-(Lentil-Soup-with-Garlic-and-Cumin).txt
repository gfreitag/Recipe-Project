Title: Shurit Ads (Lentil Soup with Garlic and Cumin)
Categories: Middle east, Egypt, Soup/stew, Beans
Yield: 6 servings
4 tb Butter
1 tb Onion; finely chopped
2 ts Ground cumin
1 ts Salt
Black pepper; freshly ground
Lemon; cut into wedges
2 c  Ads majroosh; (dried, hulled
;split, red lentils), or
;other dried lentils
2 qt Chicken stock; fresh or can
1 md Onion; peeled and quartered
1 md Tomato; quartered
2 ts Garlic; coarsely chopped
Wash the lentils in a large sieve or colander set under cold running
water, until the draining water runs clear.
In a heavy 4 to 5 quart saucepan, bring the stock to a boil over
high heat.  Add the lentils, onion, tomato and garlic, reduce the
heat to low, and simmer partially covered for 45 minutes, or until
the lentils are tender.
Meanwhile, in a small skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over
moderate heat.  When the foam begins to subside, add the chopped
onions and, stirring frequently, cook for 10 minutes, or until they
are soft and deeply browned.  Set aside off the heat.
Puree the soup through a food mill or pour the entire contents of
the saucepan into a sieve set over a deep bowl and force the
ingredients through with the back of a large spoon, pressing down
hard on the vegetables before discarding the pulp.  Return the soup
to the saucepan and, stirring constantly, cook over low heat for 3 or
4 minutes to heat through.  Stir in the cumin, salt and pepper, and
taste for seasoning. Just before serving, stir in the remaining 3
tablespoons of butter.
To serve, ladle the soup into a heated tureen, sprinkle lightly
with the reserved browned onions and serve the lemon wedges
separately.
