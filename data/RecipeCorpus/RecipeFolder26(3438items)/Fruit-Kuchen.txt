NOTES : In German Kuchen means cake. This kind of Kuchen is generally
made
with a slightly sweetened batter covered with various toppings,
which may be simply cinnamon and sugar, ground nuts and honey,
or
such fruits as apples, peaches, berries or plums. It is an
excellent cake to serve with coffee.
