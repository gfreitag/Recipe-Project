Title: Milookhiyya (Egyptian Green Herb Soup)
Categories: Middle east, Egypt, Soup/stew
Yield: 6 servings
1 ts Salt
Black pepper; freshly ground
2 ts Garlic; finely chopped
2 ts Ground coriander
2 tb Butter
1 qt Chicken stock; fresh or can
1 c  Dried milookhiyya; spinach
;like egyptian herb, picked
;clean and finely crumbled
1 tb Tomato paste
In a heavy 3 to 4 quart saucepan, bring stock to a boil over high
heat. Stir in the milookhiyya, tomato paste, salt and a few grindings
of the pepper and reduce the heat to low.  Stirring occasionally,
simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the milookhiyya has dissolved
and the soup is thick and smooth.
With a mortar and pestle or the back of a spoon, mash the garlic and
coriander to a smooth paste.  In a small skillet, melt the butter over
moderate heat.  When the foam has almost subsided, add the garlic and
coriander and, stirring constantly, cook for a minute or two until the
garlic is lightly browned.  Add the entire contents of the skillet to
the soup and, stirring constantly, simmer for 2 or 3 minutes more.
Taste for seasoning and serve at once from a heated tureen.  In
Egypt, milookhiyya is often accompanied by hot cooked rice and sliced
boiled chicken or game birds, presented separately on individual
plates.
