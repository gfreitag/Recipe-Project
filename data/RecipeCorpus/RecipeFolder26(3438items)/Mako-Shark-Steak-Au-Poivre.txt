Title: Mako Shark Steak Au Poivre
Categories: Seafood, Masterchefs, Fish, Main dish
Yield: 6 servings
1/3 c  Cognac, plus more as needed
2 c  Whipping cream
2 tb Veal glaze * OR
1/3 c  Veal stock *
4 lb Mako shark, cut into slices
-- about 4 ounces each,
-- skins removed
1/2 c  Butter, clarified
3 tb Shallots, finely chopped
Pat shark slices dry.  Salt lightly.  Arrange crushed pepper on
plate or sheet of waxed paper; dredge each slice of fish in pepper,
shaking off excess to leave light coating.

Heat clarified butter (*) in heavy, large skillet until hot.
Working in batches if necessary, saute fish slices until crusty and
lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to warm serving
plates, and keep warm.

Pour off all but about 1 tablespoon butter from skillet.  Add
shallot and toss briefly; carefully add 1/3 cup Cognac.  Add cream,
veal glaze (*) and any juices from fish.  Boil until reduced to
consistency that will lightly coat the back of a spoon.  Adjust
seasoning with salt and pepper and a few drops of Cognac.  Strain
over fish and serve.
