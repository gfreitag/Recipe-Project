In a big bowlcombine 2 cups whole wheat flour, sunflower seeds, salt
and baking soda. put your water, buttermilk, molasses and butter in a
saucepan and put over low heat until warm (butter need not melt) add
yeast. gradually add to dry ingredients. Beat at medium speed of
mixer for about two minutes, scraping sides of bowl often. Add eggs
and 1 cup of the unbleached flour. Beat at high speed for roughly two
minutes.

Stir in the remaining whole wheat flour and enough unbleached flour
to make a soft dough. Put onto a lightly floured surface. Knead on it
for about ten minutes then put it in an oiled or greased bowl,
turning the greasy side up. Put a cover on it and let it rise for
anout 45 minutes. Divide the dough in half shape it and put in two
greased 8x4 loaf pans. Let it rise for another 30 minutes or so or
until the dough rises to the tops of the bread pans. Brush the top
with evaporated milk then sprinkle with the sesame seeds which are
optional. Bake at 375 degrees "F for 30 to 35 minutes. Then turn it
out on a wire rack to cool. This makes really tasty bread, but if you
don't like the seeds you can leave out the sunflower and sesame
seeds, and it is still good. If you try it let me know how you like
it.
