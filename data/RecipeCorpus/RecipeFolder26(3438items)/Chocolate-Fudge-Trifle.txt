3 tb Creme de cacao
1/2 c  Chocolate fudge sauce
1/2 c  Diced roasted almonds
4 oz Instant chocolate fudge
-pudding and pie filling
1 c  Milk
2 c  Heavy cream, whipped
6 tb Seedless red raspberry jam
1. In a medium bowl, combine pudding mix with milk. Whisk until well

of whipped cream until well blended and no white streaks remain; set
aside. 2. To assemble trifle, heat raspberry jam in microwave or over
low heat until melted when stirred. In a 2 or 2-1/2-quart glass
serving bowl, arrange 4 or 5 slices of pound cake to cover bottom of
dish and curve up sides of bowl slightly. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon creme
de cacao over cake. Drizzle 1/4 cup chocolate sauce and then 2
tablespoons jam on top. Using back of a spoon, spread jam around
evenly. Add half of reserved pudding mixture and spread evenly. 3.
Top with 3 or 4 cake slices to cover in a single layer. Repeat as
above using 1 tablespoon creme de cacao, remaining 1/4 cup chocolate
sauce, 2 tablespoons jam and remaining pudding mixture. 4. Top with 3
or 4 more cake slices. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon creme de cacao
over cake and spread remaining 2 tablespoons raspberry jam on top.
Cover trifle with remaining whipped cream, spreading evenly. Sprinkle
almonds on top. 5. Cover trifle and refrigerate until well chilled, 5
to 6 hours or overnight. Use a large spoon to scoop out and serve.
