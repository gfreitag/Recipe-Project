This was dinner last night.   It's adapted from the recipe for samosa
filling in Madhur Jaffrey's World of the East Vegetarian Cooking (not
a vlf cookbook, but many of the recipes are adaptable and the info on
exotic spices and ingredients is very helpful).  I wrapped this stuff
in whole wheat tortillas to make a sort of multicultural
burrito--pita bread might also work well.

Give a large skillet a squirt of Pam, and briefly saute the onions.
Add the ginger, cayenne, cilantro and water.  Cover, lower heat and
simmer gently.  Add more water as the pan dries out and continue to
simmer until you have what MFK Fisher calls "an odiferous mulch"
(about five minutes, stirring occasionally).  Add the other
ingredients and turn everything gently with a spatula to mix as it
continues to cook.  Add more water if stuff is sticking.  After
another 3-4 minutes it will be ready to eat. This served two with
leftovers, but there were a few other things for dinner as well.

The original recipe called for a cup of defrosted frozen peas to be
added with the ginger and cilantro, but I didn't have any.  Other
vegetables might work as well--lightly steamed carrots, for example,.
or mushrooms.
