In his comments on this recipe, Mr. Guste Jr. states, "Little of
anything was ever discarded in the Creole kitchen that could not
somehow be used again.  Stale bread is a primary example of this.
From bread crumbs to croutons to bread pudding and lost bread, there
was a use for the stale French bread that was so often available.
Since French bread is baked daily and becomes stale in a matter of
hours there developed a preponderance of dishes dealing with the use
of stale bread. Lost bread is the root of these dishes. In this
typical offering we see the transformation of a possibly useless
product, the stale bread, into a delicious sweet dish, not unlike
French toats. Thrift was essential in the Creole kitchen, with pain
perdu as perfect example. This dish is most often served for
breakfast. ================INGREDIENTS=========================== 3
each eggs 1/4 cup sugar 1 Tbsp vanilla extract 1 Tbsp cinnamon 1/2
Tbsp nutmeg 1 cup milk 2 sticks  butter 1 loaf stale French bread
powdered sugar Louisiana cane syrup
================DIRECTIONS============================ Beat the eggs
together with the sugar until the sugar is dissolved. Blend in the
vanilla extract, cinnamon and nutment. Whisk in the milk. Cut the
French bread crosswise into 1-1/4 inch slices. Melt the butter in a
skillet. When butter is hot, begin cooking the bread by first dipping
the slices into the egg and milk mixture and then lay the slices into
the hot butter. Brown the bread on both sides and remove to a serving
platter. dust the pain perdu with powdered sugar and dribble a little
syrup over each slice. Serve 3 or 4 slices per person. Serves 6.
VARIATIONS: Your favorite syrup or maybe those homemade preserves on
the shelf in your refrigerator would go well here with your pain
perdu. You can make this with any bread that is not too highly
flavored with herbs or garlic or onions. NOTE: I think the Louisiana
cane syrup is important here.  Steen's syrup, manufactured in
Abbeville, Louisiana, will always be my favorite. (Notes from FHT -
I'm unable to get this delicious cane syrup up here on the frozen
Canadian prairies, so I'm forced to substitute Maple Syrup. It works
well.)
