You may want to do first knead and then reset and start again for
extra kneading. I made some changes to this recipe. I used regular
salt. I used oil instead of butter.  I used better for bread flour. I
used 2 tsp. gluten. I used 1/8 tsp. lecithin. I did not use dough
enhancer. Submitted By PAT REYNOLDS   On   01-05-95
