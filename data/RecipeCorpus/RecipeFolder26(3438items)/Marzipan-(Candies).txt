Nothing expresses the German love of edible art more succintly than
marzipan candies, which are shaped into piglets, cats, poodles,
flowers, fruit and all sorts of other objects. They are delicious to
eat, too. Carefully dry the shelled almonds, then grind to a powder
in an electic blender, if you have one. Blend almonds, the sugar, the
egg white and just enough rosewater or orangewater (available from
pharmacies) to make a pliable stiff dough. Knead with fingers, then
place on board dusted with confectioners' sugar and form into desired
shapes, to resemble miniature apples, peaches, strawberries or, if
you have an artist's touch, little pigs or birds. Tint with food
coloring. Balls of marzipan may be rubbed in chocolate dots or
colored sugar. If dough becomes too stiff, work in a little lemon
juice, rosewater or orangewater, adding drop by drop. When candies
are shaped, dry thoroughly in a cool, airy place for 24 hours, then
wrap separately or place in a container (such as a little straw
basket for fruit) and cover completely with Saran or other plastic
wrap. Makes 2 pounds of candy. From: The Art of German Cooking, by
