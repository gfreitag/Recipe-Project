Categories: Beans, Vegetarian, Low-cal/fat, Soup/stew
Yield: 4 servings
Pepper, ground fresh
5 oz Spinah leaves; cleaned
4 tb Non fat yogurt
8 x  Orange segments
1 tb Cilantro; chopped
2/3 c  Black beans
3 tb Onions; chopped
2 tb Celery; chopped
1 ts Garlic; chopped fine
1 ts Fresh ginger; grated
1 tb Orange zest
Sort, wash, and drain the black beans. In a heavy sauce pot combine
the beans, onions, celery, garlic, ginger, orange zest, and pepper to
taste. Add 6 cups of water and bring to a boil, stirring
occasionally. Lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hr. or until
the beans are fully cooked(will vary with age and type of black
beans.) Meanwhile, carefully wash the spinach leaves to remove all
sand and grit. Place the washed leaves in a heated teflon suate pan.
Stir until they are wilted but still bright green, 2-3 mins. Add
pepper and cool. Mince the cooked spinach and set it aside. Spoon one
third of the black beans into a blender or food processor. Puree
until completely smooth and transfer back to the soup. Stir the
spinach into the soup, return to a simmer, and serve immediately.
Ladle the soup into shallow rimmed soup plates. Spoon nonfat yogurt
into the centre of each, garnish with 2 orange segments, and sprinkle
with fresh cilantro.
