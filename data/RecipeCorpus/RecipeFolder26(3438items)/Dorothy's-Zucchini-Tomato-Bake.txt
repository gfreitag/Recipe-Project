Title: Dorothy's Zucchini-Tomato Bake
Categories: Vegetable, Cheese/eggs, Tomato
Yield: 4 servings
5 ea Sprigs fresh parsley, minced
2 ts Chicken bullion
1 c  Hot water
1 pk Mushroom gravy mix
16 ea Cheese slices
1 ea Large zucchini, thick sliced
1 ea Med onion, thin sliced
2 ea Large tomatoes, sliced
5 ea Cloves garlic, minced
2 ea Heads fresh dill, minced
Combine bullion, gravy mix and hot water. Stir until dissolved.  Add
garlic, dill and parsley.  Layer 1/2 of vegetables, 1/2 of cheese.
Repeat for second layer.  Pour gravy mix over.  Bake at 350 degrees
for 1 hour.

Note: Created one season when I ran out of ideas for an
over-productive crop of both tomatoes and zucchini! Have also made
this with fresh sliced mushrooms added to the vegetables, and a brown
gravy mix .  Great served with rice.  The liquid from the vegetables
does make this somewhat "soupy".
