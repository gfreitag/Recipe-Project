Title: Peanut Butter & Jelly Bread Abm
Categories: Breadmaker, Nuts/grains, Bread, Fruit
Yield: 24 servings
2 tb Jelly
1/2 c  Peanut butter
1 1/4 c  Water; very warm
1/2 tb Yeast
3 c  Flour, bread
2 tb Sugar
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
push Start.

The crust will get well-done, so it's recommended to turn down the
darkness control to halfway between the light and middle settings.

Sylvia's notes: This came out fine.  Great for the kids.
