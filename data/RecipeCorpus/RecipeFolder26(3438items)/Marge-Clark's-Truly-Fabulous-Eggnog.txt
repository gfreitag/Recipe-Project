Title: Marge Clark's Truly Fabulous Eggnog
Categories: Holiday, Beverage, Alcohol, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 2 servings
-mixing.  Add
Sugar, mix until disolved.
-sprinkle with nutmeg.
Beat eggwhites until
-fluffy, fold into eggnog.
-Cover and let
"age" for 24 hours.
These proportions yield
-approx 3 1/2 quarts,
-filling my big pyrex
Mixing bowl EXACTLY to the
-rim.  ++> 14 cup or 28
-punchcup
Servings. It;s really
-imperative that you let it
-rest overnite
To "smooth out" the
-flavour.  If refrigerator
-space is at a
Premium, you can keep the
-eggwhites covered,
-unbeaten, in a
Separate container and just
-let the
-egg/cream/sugar/liquor mix
"mellow", beating and
-adding the eggwhites
-before serving.
I used 2 punchbowls, one
-big one held a double
-batch, the smaller
One held 1 1/2 batches.  I
-used 1/2 gallon milk
-cartons to store
It in the fridge until
-party day....  and kept
-the punchbowl
Supply chilled with a giant
-block of "natural" vanilla
-ice cream.
Marge Clark's Christmas
-Eggnog
For over 20 years, this has
-been the center point of a
Christmas party we
-gave...since I no longer
-do the party,
My eldest son has started
-doing it.
Don't be frightened off by
-the quantity of liquor ...
-it is
So very rich and smooth
-that I've never known
-anyone to
Get drunk on it...just
-real, real mellow.
This recipe is TRULY
-fabulous.  Sometimes I
-hear from folks who
We knew 20 years ago...they
-ask if I still do the
-eggnog party,
And tell me they still use
-the recipe.
1/2 ea Dozen eggs, separated
2/3 c  Cognac
2/3 c  Bourbon
1/3 c  Peach brandy
2/3 c  Rum
7 c  Half 'n Half
1 1/8 c  Sugar  (1 c + 2 Tbsp)
Nutmeg to taste....(lots!)
Beat the egg yolks until
-very light.  Pour in the
-liquor, one
Type at a time and beat
-well.  (Add the rum LAST
-to avoid
"curdling" the eggs).  Add
-cream slowly, while
