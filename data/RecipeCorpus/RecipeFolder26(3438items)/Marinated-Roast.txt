Categories: Main dish, Meat, Beef, Pork, Game
Yield: 8 servings
1 t  Thyme
1/2 c  Vinegar or wine
2 ea Cloves garlic
300 ml Sour cream
3 ea Tb Flour
5 lb Roast (beef, pork,
- game)
2 ea Parsnips
2 ea Carrots
Optional)
1 ea Big onion
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
15 ea Whole black pepper
2 ea Tb Sugar
1 ea Tb Vinegar or wine
Salt and pepper to taste
3 ea Stalks celery
5 ea Bayleaves
5 ea Juniper berries (
Water
1 ea Tb Salt
Cut up the veggies for the marinade and mix together.  Put the roast
into a big pot, and add vinegar or wine, spices and water so that the
meat is covered. Let sit in a cool place for 3-4 days turning the
meat over twice daily.(Place the berries and whole pepper into a bag
for easy removal.) COOKING INSTRUCTIONS: Bring the whole mixture to a
boil and boil for 15 min (watch the boilovers as it foams). Remove
the meat and boil the "marinade" for another 1.5 hrs till there is
only about 4 cups of fluids left. In the meantime finish the meat in
the oven or microwave till the internal temperature reaches 170 F
pork, game (160 F beef). Let stand for 15 min. after temp. is
reached. After the "marinade" is reduced remove bayleaves, whole
pepper and juniper from the liquid.  In a blender blend 2 cups of
boiled vegetables in 4 cups of liquid.  DO NOT use more than 8 pcs of
sliced carrots ( I slice them  into obout .25 inch thick circles) or
the gravy will be too bitter.  Put the blended liquid into a pot, add
the sour cream with approx. 3 tablespoons of flour mixed in it,
little bit of vinegar to taste and slowly bring to a boil. Add the
roast which is cut up into .25 inch thick slices and simmer for
approx. 10 min. Salt and season to taste. Serve with knedle or
noodles, cranberries on a side. Enjoy. Cooking time: 3 hrs.
