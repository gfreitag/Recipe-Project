Title: Red Lobster Cheese Rolls No. 2
Categories: Bread, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
44 oz Cold water
1/2 c  Butter or margarine
1 t  Garlic salt or powder
1 t  Italian seasonings
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
1 lb Cheddar cheese,grated
1 T  Parsley flakes
5 lb Bisquick
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
with garlic powder, parsley flakes and italian seasoning. (Amounts
will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
Serve hot. The Red Lobster manager's recipe is for a large quantity,
so you'll have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch
you desire. Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick,
1/2 cup cold water, and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will yield about
12 biscuits. You may also substitute soda water or gingerale for the
water, if desired.
