Title: Mexican Lasagna <t>
Categories: Fatfree, Pasta, Tex/mexican
Yield: 1 servings
1 c  Fatfree or 1% fat cottage
Cheese
1 c  Shredded fatfree (or low fat
If desired) cheddar cheese
1/2    Box lasagna noodles
1 cn (1 lb) fatfree vegetarian
Refried beans
1 c  Chunky salsa (any degree of
Eat you prefer)
Cook noodles according to package directions.  Rinse and drain.

In a small saucepan, mix beans and salsa and heat over a medium flame
until runny (helps to spread the mixture).  Place a small amount of
the bean mixture in the bottom of a square 8 or 9 inch baking dish.
Layer four or five lasagna noodles over the dish (cut off extra
length of noodle and save for the next noodle layer).  Spread 1/2 of
the bean/salsa mix on top of noodles then top with 1/2 the cottage
cheese and some of the cheddar. Top with more noodles then the
remaining bean/salsa mix and cottage cheese. top with more cheddar
and remaining noodles.  Top with a little more cheddar. Bake in
microwave at medium-high for 10 minutes (uncovered) or in oven for 30
minutes at 350 degrees (or until hot and bubbly).

This was really good and alot easier than it sounds.  Giving a recipe
for how you layer lasagna is really a pain!
