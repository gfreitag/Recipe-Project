Title: Pumpkin Butter 2
Categories: Can/preserv, Fruit, Pumpkin, Spread
Yield: 7 servings
1 1/2 t  Ground Cinnamon
1/4 t  Ground Allspice
1/2 t  Salt
1 c  Orange Juice
7 lb Pumpkin; raw*
Hot Water
3 1/2 c  Sugar
1 1/2 c  Honey
* Wash pumpkin.  Cut into several pieces that will fit in a 6-quart
pot. Scrape out and discard seeds.  In a 6-quart pot, cover pumpkin
pieces with hot water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce
heat to low. Cover; simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain,
discarding liquid. Use a large spoon to scrape pulp from peel;
discard peel. Press pulp through a food mill or puree in a blender or
food processor. Measure puree. A dry pumpkin variety will yield about
5 cups puree. A more moist pumpkin will yield 6 to 8 cups puree.
Return puree to pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Stirring
frequently, boil until thickened, 10 to 20 minutes. Wash seven 1/2
pint jars in hot soapy water; rinse. Keep hot until needed. Prepare
lids as manufacturer directs. When puree will mound slightly on a
spoon, measure again. USE NO MORE THAN 4 CUPS puree. Stir in
remaining ingredients. Simmer uncovered until thick enough to spread.
Test thickness of pumpkin butter with plate test, below. Ladle hot
pumpkin butter into 1 hot jar at a time, leaving 1/4-inch headspace.
Wipe rim of jar with a damp, clean cloth. Attach lid.  Place in
canner. Fill and close remaining jars. Process in a boiling water
bath.
