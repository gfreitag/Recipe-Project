To be kept on hand for delicious quick energy (pour boiling water
over and let steep a minute). Also makes a great seasoning for other
dishes. SUGGESTED INGREDIENTS:  Cabbage, carrots, celery (any part),
garlic,

geen beans, horseradish, mushrooms, mustard greens, onion, parsley,
peas and pods, peppers, spinach, tomato, watercress, and anything
welse you think of. Powder your ingredients and combine as you
please. If the right flavor combination eludes you, or you haven't
enough ingrtedients, use any good powdered vegetable broth for a base
and add you own 'extras.' Broth may be thickened if desired with a
spoonful of ground flaxseed. WE've also used groundmillet, chia, or
other seeds, with pleasing results. Add dried, powdered herb for even
greater nutrition.  We use any of a variety - comfrey,nettle,
chickweed, malva, plantain, lamb's quarters - any of the edible
weeds. Origin: Dry It - You'll Like It! circa 1973. Shared by: Sharon
