Food processor method: Put the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking
soda, cinnamon and salt into a food processor. Process briefly to
mix. Add the buttermilk, or yogurt and water, egg and oil. Turn the
machine on-off (pulse) 3 or 4 times to make a smooth batter.

By hand method: Put the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda,
cinnamon and salt into a large bowl. Stir to mix well.

Measure the buttermilk in a 2-cup glass measure. Add the egg and oil
to the measuring cup. Beat with a fork or wire whisk to blend. Add to
the flour mixture and stir to form a smooth batter.

For pancakes: Heat the griddle or skillet over moderately high heat
until it feels hot when you hold your hand directly above it. Lightly
grease the griddle. For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup batter onto the
griddle. Cook 3-5 minutes, until bubbles appear on the surface and
the undersides are golden brown. Adjust the heat if the pancakes are
browning too fast. Turn the pancakes over and cook 1-2 minutes longer
to brown the second side.

For waffles: heat the waffle iron; grease it lightly. Pour in the
appropriate amount of batter and spread to the edges. Close and cook
until the iron will open easily.

Keep finished waffles or pancakes warm in a 200'F. oven - pancakes on
a plate and loosely covered to keep moist; waffles directly on the
oven rack, uncovered, to stay crisp. Makes 8 4" pancakes. Serves 4.
