Title: New Orleans Style Navy (Pea) Beans & Rice
Categories: Main dish, Beans, Sausage, Rice
Yield: 6 servings
1    Onion, chopped fine
1/2    Green pepper
1/2 ts Cajun seasoning
OR
1/2 ts Liquid crab boil
1 lb Dried navy beans
(soak overnight)
1/2 lb Smoked or Cajun sausage
2 cl Garlic, chopped fine
2    Bay leaves
1 ds Parsley
Combine ingredients enough water to cover (about 1 inch above beans).
cook until tender, add water from time to time to make a thick, rich
gravy. Serve over cooked rice.

Note: you could use pickle meat or ham (cubed) instead of cajun or
smoked sausage.

Note: I soak the beans in water with 2 ts of baking soda at least 4
hours.
