Categories: Main dish, Fatfree, Vegetable, Bbq/grill
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 T  Minced gingerroot
1/2 t  Oil
2    Red bell peppers, seeded
-and cut into 1 inch
-squares
12    Button mushrooms
12 sm White boiling onions,
-peeled (bottled onions
-work fine)
1 1/2    Lbs firm tofu, cut into 1
" slabs*
1/4 c  Hosin sauce
1/4 c  Chinese rice wine or sake
2 1/2 tb Soy sauce
1 1/2 T  Sugar
1 1/2 T  Catsup
1 T  Minced garlic (three
-cloves)
* Note: FIrst press the tofu. To do this, cut the tofu into 1 1/2 "
slabs and lay each on a paper towel. Top with another paper towel and
lay a heavy plate on top of each slab. Leave them this way for 15
min. This firms up the tofu so it doesn/t fall apart on the kabobs.
When ready to use the tofu, remove the plate and towels and cut the
tofu up into 1 inch cubes.

In a medium sized bowl, whisk together hosin, wine or sake, soy sauce,
sugar, catsup, garlic, ginger, and oil until combined. Add tofu and
toss gently to coat. Let stand covered at room temperature for 1 hour.

Remove the tofu with a slotted spoon. Add peppers, mushrooms, and
onions to the marinade. Toss to coat.  Drain off the remaining
marinade.

Thread tofu (carefully) and vegetables onto 12 skewers. Place skewers
on the grill (or on a single layer on a broiler pan if you do them in
the oven). Brush with marinade and grill10 minutes. Turn skewers over
and brush with remaining marinade. Griil 10 - 15 minutes longer or
until vegetables are tender. Serves 4 (3 skewers each.)
