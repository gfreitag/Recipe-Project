Title: Making Greek Balsamic Vinegar
Categories: Fatfree, Condiment
Yield: 1 servings
1 x  Greek Oregano
1 x  Vinegar
Well, it's simple and unmeasured.  I decide how much vinegar I want to
steep, and choose a wide-mouthed jar of that size.  I fill this jar
with roughly equal amounts of fresh Greek oregano (a very strong, hot
variety...beware as some fresh oregano is insipid), mint (for this, I
like the yerba buena variety ...a coarse, strong spearmint), and
winter savory (stonger flavored than summer savory). I generally try
to bruise the leaves a bit.  I pour the vinegar over the herbs, put a
layer of waxed paper and a couple of layers of plastic wrap over the
mouth of the bottle (to help retard the inevitable corrosion of the
metal cap) and then screw on the jar lid.  I place the jar either on
a sunny windowsill or on the deck for a few weeks, and then strain
the vinegar through a coffee filter and return it to the original
vinegar bottle (which usually has a more corrosion-resistant lid).  I
don't like to leave any herbs in the vinegar, and don't like to add
any for decoration, either, because they tend to add a funky taste
that I don't care for if they sit long enough.
