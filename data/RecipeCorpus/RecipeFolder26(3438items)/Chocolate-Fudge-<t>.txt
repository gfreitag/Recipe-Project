Title: Chocolate Fudge <t>
Categories: Fatfree, Candy
Yield: 1 servings
Milk
1 t  Vanilla extract (or pecan
Extract ..)
5 c  Miniature marshmallows
1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
2 T  All natural butter-flavored
Sprinkles
1/2 c  Plus 2 T  evaporated skimmed
Place all ingredients (except marshmallows) into a large heavy pan

Prepare a plate/pan by spraying with butter flavored vegetable spray.
(I used a small cookie sheet) Measure the marshmallows and set aside.

Place the pan on the burner set to the hottest setting. Mix and stir
continously

When mixture comes to a full rolling boil, set the timer to 5 minutes
and continue stirring.  After 5 minutes remove the pan from the stove
and continue stirring until mixture no longer boils.

Add marshmallows and stir until marshmallows are melted and mixture is
smooth.  Pour mixture into prepared pan.

The mixture is very stringy but after it sits for a few hours (fudging
process) it gets the fudge consistency.
