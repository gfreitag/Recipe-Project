Title: Seasoning a Wok
Categories: Information, Stir fry
Yield: 1 info  Traditional carbon steel woks are the best conductors of heat. Foods
won't stick to a well-seasoned wok and you can use less oil for
stir-frying.

To season the wok, wash with warm water and a mild dishwashing soap.
Dry well. Coat the inside with vegetable oil and heat over
medium-high heat for about 5 minutes. The wok will begin to darken.
Let cool, wash and dry again. Heat over a hot burner until completely
dry to prevent the wok from rusting. After each use, wash with hot,
soapy water. never clean with harsh abrasives. Dry well over a hot
burner. if you like, wipe the wok very lightly with oil to seal, but
keep in mind that excess oil in the bottom of the wok will become
gummy.
