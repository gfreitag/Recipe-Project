Title: Beaten Biscuits
Categories: Bread
Yield: 42 servings
3/4 ts Salt
1/2 c  Lard or vegetable shortening
7 tb Ice water
2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
3/4 ts Sugar
1/2 ts Baking powder
Recipe by: Fannie Flagg's Original Whistle Stop Cafe Cookbook Insert
steel blade in food processor bowl. Add flour, sugar, baking powder,
and salt, and pulse until well blended. Add lard; process until
mixture resembles coarse meal. With processor running, add 7 Tbs
water in a steady stream through food chute until dough forms a ball,
adding more water if necessary. Process an additional 2 mins. Preheat
oven to 400Â°F. Roll dough on a floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness.
Cut into 1 1/2-inch rounds. Place biscuits on ungreased cookie sheet
and prick top of each biscuit 3 times with a fork. Bake for 20 mins,
or until lightly browned. YIELD: about 3 1/2 dozen

NOTES : Unless you, like the cooks in bygone days, have a 2-foot
thick,
sturdy butcher block table to pound these on, the time to beat
them, and the inclination to do so, you will most likely
appreciate this modern method.
