slowly 3 hours or until meat almost falls apart.  Tear into small
pieces with fork. Add remaining ingredients except spaghetti and
cheese.  Cover tightly and simmer 2 hours longer, stirring
occasionally.  Remove cover and continue cooking until sauce thickens
to desired consistency. Cook spaghetti following directions on
package, allowing 1 pound for 4 servings. Ladle sauce over spaghetti.
Top with cheese. Makes about 3-1/2 quarts sauce, enough for 4 pounds

freeze extra sauce in half-pint, pint or quart freezer jars and use
as needed. Source: Fred Towner
