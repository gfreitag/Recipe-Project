Title: Basic Lard Sugar Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
1 t  Vanilla
1 t  Baking powder
2 c  Flour
3/4 c  Lard
3/4 c  Packed brown sugar
1 ea Egg
Beat the lard, sugar and egg together until creamy and well blended.
Stir in the vanilla, and add the baking powder and flour until a
dough is formed.  (At this point, you could stir in some nuts and
chocolate chips to make this into toll house dough) Form dough into
balls about 1 inch in diameter, and place on a cookie sheet. (Leave
plenty of room between the cookies, as they will spread considerably
when baking). Flatten the balls slightly with your fingers to make a
round cookie. (For sugar cookies, sprinkle the top with a bit of
sugar.) Bake in a preheated 350 oven until the edges are nicely
brown. Remove and let cool. Makes about 18 cookies Shared by: Kathy
