MMMMM------------------------BASIC DOUGH-----------------------------
2 c  Flour
8 oz Pkg cream cheese
1/2 lb Softened butter
blend butter & cheese.  beat in flour.  chill overnight.  Freezes
well. Variations: Cherry Cookies: 1 12-16 oz jar Cherry Preserves.
(I've found that either Polaner or Kroger's brand seems to work much
better than Smuckers)  Drain preserves thru a strainer, trying to
drain off as much of the jelly as possible, leaving cherry pieces.
1/4 C sugar, mixed with 2 T ground pecans or walnuts 1 egg white,
diluted with 1 tsp water. 1/2 batch cream cheese pastry. roll pastry
quite thin on floured baking sheet. cut in rounds with a 2" biscuit
cutter. (save scraps, form into ball, chill & reroll)  put a dab of
drained cherry preserves on each round. Fold into crescent, seal
edges TIGHT, brush top with eggwhite mixture, and dip tops in
sugar/nut mixture. place close together on ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake at 325 degrees until just starting to brown, (15 mins?)they burn
easily. Remove immediately, cool on racks and pack airtight. These
freeze beautifully, but only last a few days at room temperature.
Nutjammers: 12 oz jar apricot preserves 2 C chopped nuts 2 tsp sugar.
Blend together well, set aside. 1/2 recipe pastry. Roll pastry into
rectangular sheet. cut into 3" squares. put dab of filling in each
square, fold into turnovers. Bake at 350 for 15 or so minutes.
follow storage instructions above.
