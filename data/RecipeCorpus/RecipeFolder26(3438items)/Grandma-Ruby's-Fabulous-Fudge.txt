Date help: Famous recipes for divinity, penoche, fudge, aplets and
all the holiday favorites are collected together on our Christmas
Nuts and Candies bulletin.  To obtain this four-page leaflet, send 3
cents and a self-addressed envelope to Nancy Morris, Oregonian
Hostess House, The Oregonian, 1320 S. W. Broadway, Portland 1, Or.

So, when were 3 cent stamps used?  And does anyone know the relevance
of "Portland 1"?  No zip code was given, either. Part of a Green
Trading Stamps ad is here, and bits of what seems to be a society
section...this is really interesting!! At least to me....I hope I'm
not the only one??
