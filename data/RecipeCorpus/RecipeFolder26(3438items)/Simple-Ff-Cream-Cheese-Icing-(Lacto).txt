Title: Simple Ff Cream Cheese Icing (Lacto)
Categories: Fatfree, Cheese/eggs, Cake/cookie
Yield: 1 servings
x  Maple syrup
x  FF cream cheese
Use a blender, and put in Maple syrup until the mixture is sweet
enough. Only disadvage: if you keep it in the fridge for a while,
some cracks appear in the icing. So, I suggest you cool the icing in
a bowl, then put it on just before serving the cake.
