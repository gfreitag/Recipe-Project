Red Wine Sauce: In large saucepan, brown shallots, mushrooms, and
ground lamb in butter. Stir in red wine, chicken stock, and veal
stock. Boil until reduced by half. Add juniper berries, bay leaf,
thyme, garlic, and vinegar. Boil 10 minutes. Strain sauce, discarding
solids. Return sauce to saucepan. Stir in lemon juice and salt and
pepper to taste. Cover, keep warm.

Nut Stuffing: While sauce is reducing, in food processor, pulse
pistachio nuts with on/off turns until chopped. Add chestnut puree,
ground lamb, and brandy. Process briefly until blended.

Lamb Loin in Puff Pastry: Let puff pastry stand at room temperature
according to package directions. Mound 1/4 of stuffing on each lamb
loin. Using hands, mold stuffing around lamb until loin is completely
enclosed with stuffing mixture. Preheat oven to 400Ã¸. Gently unfold 1
sheet of pastry on lightly floured surface. Press pastry together at
the two fold seams to seal. Cut pastry in half. Repeat with remaining
sheet of pastry. Roll each pastry to 10x8" rectangle. Arrange a
wrapped lamb loin crosswise in center of each sheet of pastry.

Overlap long sides of pastry over meat and fold over together to seal.
