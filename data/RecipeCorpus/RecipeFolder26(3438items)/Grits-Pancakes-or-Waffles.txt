PANCAKES OR PANCAKES:::::: Beat the grits with the egg yolk until
smooth; then stir in the buttermilk and butter.  Or place all these
ingredients in a food processor and run until smooth. Sift the flour,
sugar, baking powder, soda and salt together. Stir the flour mixture
into the batter. (This recipe may be prepared in advance up to this
point. Cover and refrigerate until ready to cook.)  Beat the egg
whites to soft peaks and gently fold them into the batter.  FOR
PANCAKES: heat a griddle over medium-high heat.  Lightly butter, if
necessary. Drop the batter by the tablespoonful into the griddle and
cook until bubbles begin to break the surface, about 2 minutes.  Turn
and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes more.  Repeat with the
remaining batter. FOR WAFFLES: preheat a waffle iron. If it is not
nonstick, butter lightly. For each waffle, cook unitl the waffle is
crisp and golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with the remaining batter.
BASIC BOILED GRITS: Pour the grits into the large bowl and cover with
cold water. Skim of the chaff as it floats to surface. Sitr the grits
about and skim again again until all the chaff has been removed.
Drain the grits in a sieve.  Bring 4 cups water to a boil in
medium-sized saucepan. Add the salt and slowly stir in the grits.
Cook at a simmer, stirring frequently, until the grits are
done--about 40 minutes. Remove the grits from the heat and stir in
the butter. Source: Good Old Grits Cookbook by Bill Neal and David
