Title: Pumpkin Cream
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetarian, Pumpkin, Can/preserv
Yield: 4 servings
2    To 3 TB water
1 tb Sugar  (I've used Sucanat &
White sugar successfully)
1 t  Vanilla
3/4 c  Rice milk
1/2 c  Solid pack pumpkin
3/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Tapioca flour (not pearls)
MMMMM---------------------------OPTION--------------------------------
(3-4" long)
1    Stick licorice root, split
Pour rice milk into a two-cup measuring cup.  Add pumpkin until liquid
level is up to 1 1/4 cups.  Add water until level is at two cups.
Stir, pour into pot, add licorice root, if using.  Cover. Bring to
rolling boil.

While liquid is coming to a boil, mix tapioca, sweetner and 2-3 TB
water and stir well until smooth.

Once liquid is boiling, turn of flame/remove from heat. Fish out
licorice root, if using.  Stir with a wooden spoon for around a
minute to let the mixture cool off a bit.  Stir in vanilla.
Alternatively, stir vanilla into tapioca mixture.

Continue stirring and slowly pour tapioca mixture into hot liquid. The
liquid will gel almost immediately.  Stop stirring once the mixture is
smooth.  Cover an let it all cool off for twenty minutes or so.

Pour into 1/2 cup bowls and cover with plastic, or pour into small
jars and screw on lids (more ecological, not as pretty).
Refridgerate and serve cold.

You can eat this warm right away but I don't know if it reheats well.

NOTES: If the mixture did not gel try adding some more tapioca
immediately. I have found, though, that once the gel breaks up you
can't fix it.

Try different variations - use different "filling" or more or less
sweetner, more vanilla, other flavorings, vary the milk/water ratio
etc. In some cases you may need to add more thickener in order to get
it all to gel.
