Place each fillet on one half of foil.  Season with salt and pepper
to taste. Mix orange juice with horseradish; spoon over fillets.
Sprinkle evenly with tomato and onion.  Surround each fillet with
sweet pepper strips and carrots.  Bring edges of foil together to

oven for 10 to 15 minutes (depending on thickness of fillets) or
until fish is opaque and flakes easily when tested with fork. Garnish
