Categories: Bread, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 2 loaves
3 tb Sugar
1 tb Salt
6 oz Sharp Cheddar Cheese;
-shredded
1    Egg
1 c  Milk
1 c  Water
2 tb Butter
2 pk Active Dry Yeast
5 1/3 c  Flour
Combine milk, 1/2 cup of the water, and the butter in a small
saucepan and heat until butter melts. Set aside to cool.

Sprinkle the yeast over remaining water in a small bowl.Set aside to
proof and soften. Place 1 3/4 cups of the flour, the sugar and salt
in a large bowl.

Using an electric mixer, gradually add the liquids to the dry
ingredients and beat 2 minutes at medium speed, scraping the sides of
the bowl occasionally. Add cheese, egg and 3/4 cup flour, or enough
to make a thick batter.

Beat on high speed for 2 minutes, again scraping bowl occasionally.
Gradually stir in just enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff
batter so it leaves the sides of the bowl. Cover with a damp cloth
and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Adjust rack in the lower third of oven; preheat ot 375oF. Using a
wooden spoon, stir the raised batter down until it is almost its
original volume. Beat for 1 minute.

Spoon batter into 2 deep, well-greased, round, 1 quart casseroles.
Bake 40-50 minutes, or until golden. Cool 5 minutes, then remove from
casseroles and cool, rounded sides up, on wire racks.
