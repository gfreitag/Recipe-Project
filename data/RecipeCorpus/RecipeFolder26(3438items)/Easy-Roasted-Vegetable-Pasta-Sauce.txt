Title: Easy Roasted Vegetable Pasta Sauce
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Pasta, Salsa/sauce
Yield: 8 servings
2    Jars ff spaghetti sauce or
Omemade equivelent
2 T  Fresh basil, minced
x  Pasta: Use penne,rigatoni or
Some other substantial
Pasta
2    Red bell peppers, sliced in
1/2 inch wide strips
3    Big onions, or 4 small
Onions
1/2    Garlic bulb
1 lb Mushrooms, cleaned and
Sliced
Preheat oven to 400. You will need 2 non-stick standard size baking
sheets. Cut the bell peppers into strips and place on a non-stick
baking sheet, skin side down. Cut the onions into thick (1/2") slices
and place on baking sheet. Peel the skin off the garlic cloves and
set the cloves on top of the onion slices (one clove per onion
slice). Bake at 400 for 30-40 minutes. The vegetables should be soft
and have just a few brown spots.

While the vegetables roast, slice the mushrooms and saute them in 1 T
water in the bottom of a big saucepan. When they are cooked, add the
2 jars of spaghetti sauce and the basil.  Warm the whole sauce
through and allow to simmer until the roasted vegetables are done.
Dump the roasted vegetables into the sauce and stir to separate the
onion rings.

Serve over penne pasta (which was cooking while you made the sauce
since you think ahead, of course). Ridiculously simple, but it tastes
good.
