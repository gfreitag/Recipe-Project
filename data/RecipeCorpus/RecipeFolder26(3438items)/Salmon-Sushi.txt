Filet out the he middle portion from back to front. Marinate for one
day in a mixture of salt and 5% vinegar until the surface of the fish
is "cooked" (like seviche). Freeze overnight and then slice thin and
serve. I didn't get the proportions of salt and vinegar but I am
assuming that it is very similar to what I use for pickling fish,
about 3 parts fish to 2.2 parts vinegar and .2 parts salt. It was
yummy.
