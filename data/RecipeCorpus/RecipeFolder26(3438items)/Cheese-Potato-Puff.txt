"I enjoy entertaining and always look for recipes that can be made
ahead of time.  I got this comforting potato recipe from my
mother-in-law. It's wonderful because I can

prepare it the night before.  It contains basic ingredients that
everyone loves like milk and cheddar cheese." - Beverly Templeton 12
