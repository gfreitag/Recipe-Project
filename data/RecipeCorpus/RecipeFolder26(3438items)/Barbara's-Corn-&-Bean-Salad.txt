Title: Barbara's Corn & Bean Salad
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Beans, Salad
Yield: 1 servings
Onions, chopped
Balsamic Vinegar
Lemon Juice
Frozen corn
Canned Kidney beans
Chopped cilantro
My favorite is frozen corn added to a can of kidney beans, chopped
cilantro, chopped onions, balsamic vinegar and some lemon juice. You
can use your imagination after this point. For example, add some
white beans and/or frozen green peas which have been just cooked
slightly, about one minute.
