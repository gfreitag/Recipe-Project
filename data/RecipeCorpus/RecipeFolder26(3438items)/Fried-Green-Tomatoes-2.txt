Categories: Side dish, Tomato
Yield: 6 servings
1/2 ts Salt

1    Egg; beaten
1 c  Buttermilk
1 c  Self-rising flour
1/3 c  Cornmeal
Recipe by: Fannie Flagg's Original Whistle Stop Cafe Cookbook Mix egg
and buttermilk in a shallow dish. Mix flour, cornmeal, and salt in a
shallow dish. Working in batches, dip tomato slices into egg mixture,
allowing excess to drip back into dish. Coat with flour mixture. Fry
in hot bacon drippings (375Â°F) in a large heavy skillet until
browned, turning once with tongs. Transfer to a colander to drain.
YIELD: 6 servings

NOTES : Don't crowd the skillet when frying green tomatoes. Keep them
in a
single layer, with plenty of space in between slices. If too
many
are put in the pan, the oil temperature will be lowered and the
food will absorb the grease rather than be seared by it,
resulting
in soggy tomatoes.
