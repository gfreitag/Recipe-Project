Title: Veg. Time's Vlf Vegan Pastry Crust
Categories: Fatfree, Pastry, Pie/tart
Yield: 1 servings
t  Instant yeast
1/4 c  Whole wheat flour (not
Pastry flour)
1/2 t  Salt
2 T  Frozen apple juice
1 c  Unbleached flour
1/2 c  Warm soymilk
3 T  Leftover mashed potatoes or
3 T  Instant mashed potato flakes
Mixed wi
With 2 1/2 Tbs. hot water
1 T  Maple syrup or honey
1 t  Regular dry yeast or 1/2
Pastry for "free form pies" (you wrap the big piece of pastry up over
the top)

Mix together soymilk, potatoes, syrup or honey, and yeast in a medium
bowl or a food processor bowl. Let stand 5 minutes. Add salt and
flours. If using a food processor, process 30 seconds. Otherwise, mix
and knead mixture on a lightly floured surface 5 minutes.

(It says here to place in oiled bowl and oil top lightly, but I think
we can figure out alternatives.) Cover and let rise until doubled,
about an hour. Dough can also be allowed to rise in the 'fridge 2-24
hours.
