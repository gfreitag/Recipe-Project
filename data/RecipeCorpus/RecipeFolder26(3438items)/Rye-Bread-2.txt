NOTES : The allspice really adds a unique, flavorful to this
recipe.This
recipe is for a very low rising, dense bread with tremendous
flavor. If you judge successful bread based on how high it
rises
in your pan, don't even try this. If you judge successful bread
based on flavor and texture, you MUST try this. There is a lot
of
flour in this recipe, so watch the kneading and scrape the
sides
of the pan if necessary.
