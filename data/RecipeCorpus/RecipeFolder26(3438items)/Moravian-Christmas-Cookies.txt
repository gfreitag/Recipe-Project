together the brown sugar, baking soda, salt, and all the spices. Heat
molasses just to the boiling point but do not boil. Stir in the
shortening until absolutely smooth. Cool slightly, then beat in the
sugar-spice mixture. Now knead in the flour with your hands until the
dough holds together. Shape into a big ball and chill in refrigerator
until firm. This dough will keep for weeks so you can bake as many
cookies as you want at a time. Break off pieces of the dough and roll
paper-thin on a lightly floured board. Cut into circles, place on
greased cookie sheet, and bake 6 to 8 mins in a preheated 375Â°F oven.
Makes about 10 dozen.
