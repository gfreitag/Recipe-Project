Dough: Butter 2 9x5x3" loaf pans. Butter a 4 quart bowl. In a small
bowl, combine warm water and pinch sugar. Sprinkle yeast over water
mixture. Let stand until yeast dissolves and bubbles. While yeast is
dissolving, in a large miging bowl combine 3 tb sugar, butter and
salt. Pour in warm milk. Stir until butter almost melts.

Stir in 3 cups flour and dissolved yeast. Beat on high speed for 3
minutes. Stir raisins into batter. Stir in ehough of remaining flour
with a wooden spoon until dough forms a ball. Turn dough out onto a
well-floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 8-10
minutes, adding enough of remaining flour to keep dough from
sticking. Place dough in buttered bowl, turning once to butter
surface. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double, about 1 1/4
to 1 1/2 hours. Punch dough down. Turn out on a floured board. Divide
dough in half. Cover and let rest 10 minutes.

Filling: While dough rests, in a small bowl combine 1/2 cup sugar and
cinnamon. Mix well and set aside.

Assembly: Roll half dough to a 12x8" rectangle. Sprinkle with hlaf of
cinnamon filling. Press filling into dough as much as possible. Roll
up tightly, jelly-roll fashion, starting at the short side. Pinch
dough together at seam. Pinch ends to seal and fold under loaf.
Arrange seam-side down in loaf pan. Repeat with remaining dough.

Cover and let rise in a warm place until double, about 45 minutes to
an hour. Preheat oven to 375øF. Bake at 375øF for 40-45 minutes,
tenting loosely with foil during the last 15 minutes of baking time,
if necessary to prevent overbrowning. Remove loaves from oven. Remove
from pans. Coll loaves on racks.
