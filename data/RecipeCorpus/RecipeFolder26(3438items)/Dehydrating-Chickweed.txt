We mention chickweed specifically to include a recipe for CHICKWEED
OINTMENT, a home remedy we wouldn't be without.  It seems to work on
itches of all kinds - insect bites, rashes, surface inflammations on
any part of the body. (Read up about chickweed's properties and uses
in a herbal directory)  Gather chickweed with it is most lush and
green. Although easily pulled, it is best cut with scissors or
clippers, to avoid the dirt that comes up with the roots.  Dry
thoroughly and powder. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%

In a small bowl, mix 1/4 cup dried powdered chickweed with 1/2 cup
home rendered lard (the commercial kind contains additives)  Let
stand in dehydrator until lard is very green, having drawn as much as
possible from the chickweed.  Strain and mix in 1 tbsp melted
beeswax.  The 'green' lard will have to be heated a bit more to mix
easily, but DO NOT OVERHEAT. The beeswax helps solidify the ointment,
which otherwise would melt at skin temperature and be very messy.  It
also has healing properties of it's own. Pour the ointment into small
containers and refrigerate what is not in immediate use. Origin: Dry
It - You'll Like It! circa 1973. Shared by: Sharon Stevens, Jan/95.
