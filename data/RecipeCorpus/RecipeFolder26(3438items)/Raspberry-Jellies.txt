Title: Raspberry Jellies
Categories: Candy, Fruit
Yield: 1 serving
-coloring if necessary
2 T  Cold water
10 dr Lemon juice
1/2 pt Strained fresh raspberry
-juice
1 lb Loaf sugar
1 oz Powdered gelatin
Prepare raspberry juice by crushing the fruit, warming it in a bowl
over hot water until the juice flows freely and then straining
through muslin. Soak the gelatin in the cold water. Dissolve the
sugar in the juice and boil up to 240 F or the soft ball stage. Add
the lemon juice and gelatin. Re-heat to 240 F and pour into a tin
previously rinsed in cold water. If the color is pale add a few drops
of cochineal before the end, but fresh fruit should give a brilliant
color. When set, loosen the sides with a hot knife and stand the pan
on a cloth wrung out of boiling water. Turn the jelly out on to a
board. Cut into cubes and roll in very fine confectioner's sugar.
Stand the sweets in a warm place overnight so that the sugar crystals
adheres. Blackcurrant Jujubes 1/2 pint pure strained blackcurrant
syrup 1 oz granulated sugar 1 tablespoon pure glycerine 6 tablespoon
glucose 1 oz powdered gelatin Soften the gelatin in a little water.
Dissolve the sugar and glucose in the juice - very slowly, over
gentle heat.  Add glycerine and bring to boiling point. Remove from
heat, add gelatin and stir until dissolved. Re-heat but do not boil.
Rinse a 6" sandwich tin with cold water; pour the jelly mixture in.
Proceed as in second paragraph of directions for Raspberry Jellies.
This is a very good sweet for irritated throats. Fruit Jellies All
juicy fruits in season make delicious sweets.  Proceed as for
Raspberry Jellies, using coloring when necessary to enhance the
natural tint. Redcurrants, gooseberries - both green and red -
blackberries, hips and pineapples are just a few to be tried. Fresh
pineapple must be well cooked if used with gelatin, as it contains a
natural digestant which dissolves gelatin. Two methods of
Crystalizing follow in the next message. CRYSTALIZING CANDIED FRUIT
(This is the chapter that the author said to use for crystalizing the
jellies. I assume where it says fruit you would substitute jellies.)
A sparkling finish is much sought after in this class of sugar work,
so here are two recipes-one very simple, the other correct and of
lasting quality. Con't next message * QMPro 1.0 90-8356 * New Jersey,
