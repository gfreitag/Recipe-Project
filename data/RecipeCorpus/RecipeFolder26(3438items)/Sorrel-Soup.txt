well-washed and dried sorrel leaves very fine. Cook onion in heated
butter until limp, but do not brown. Stir in sorrel and cook over a
low heat until wilted --- takes about 5 mins. Blend cream and egg
yolks together. Heat chicken broth to a boil, then stir a little into
yolk mixture, beating hard. Pour back into broth and heat. Beat
constantly and do not allow it to boil. Add sorrel mixture and salt
and pepper to taste. Serve hot or refrigerate and serve icy cold. If
you like a smoother mixture, blend in an electric blender. Serves 4
to 6.
