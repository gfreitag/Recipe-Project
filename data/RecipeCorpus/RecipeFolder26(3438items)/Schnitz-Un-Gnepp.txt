Apples and buttons, this best-known of all Pennsylvania Dutch dishes
is called. Truly a meal in itself, it contains proteins, starch and
carbohydrates in a giant slab of ham surrounded by raised dumplings
and stewed apples. To prepare, add apples and their liquid to ham and
boil for one hour. If dried apples are used, they should be soaked
overnight first. Add brown sugar. Prepare dumplings by sifting
together flour, baking powder, salt and pepper. Stir in well-beaten
egg, butter and enough milk to make a stiff but moist batter. Drop
batter by large spoonfuls into main dish, cover tightly and steam for
about 20 minutes. Frozen oven-ready yeast biscuits may be substituted
for the dumpling batter.
