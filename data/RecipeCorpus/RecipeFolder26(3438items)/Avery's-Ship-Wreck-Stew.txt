In a large skillet saute green pepper; onion; celery and garlic.
Saute until celery is tender then add ground beef and brown.

In a huge kettle add the tomatoes, beans, potatoes, corn, chili
powder, salt and pepper and bring to a boil.  Be sure to use the
juice from the canned vegetables and rinse the corn out or it will
need extra water.

When it starts to boil add the meat mixture and bring back to a boil.
Lower to a simmer about 35 to 45 minutes.  Add the asparagus and
juice into the kettle and heat to a simmer and enjoy.

Might want to add more chili pepper according to your taste.

P.S. Do not boil after you add the asparagus.

Note: I used 1 tablespoon of chili powder and 1 teaspoon of salt and
pepper The stew was very good but considerably under spiced.  Next
time try doubling the spices.
