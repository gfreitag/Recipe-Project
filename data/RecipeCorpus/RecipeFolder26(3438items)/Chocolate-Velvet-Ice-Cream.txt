"Also reminiscent of frozen mousse is this decadently rich chocolate
ice cream.  The addition of grated chocolate provides extra bursts of
flavor, but you may omit it if you prefer smoother, unbroken texture.
For a triple chocolate treat, leave in the extra chocolate and splash
each serving with creme de cacao."

cream. Chill and stir freeze.  Grate and stir in semi-sweet
chocolate. Makes: 1 quart Posted by: Debbie Carlson - Cooking Echo
