1 c  Sugar
4 T  Melted butter
1/2 t  Cinnamon
2 c  Raisins
2 c  Coarsely chopped candied
-cherries
1 c  Finely chopped nuts
3/4 c  Chopped citron
Whole blanched almonds
Beaten egg
Butter
2 pk Yeast (active dry or
-compressed)
1 t  Sugar
Water
8 c  Flour (about)
1 T  Salt
2 T  Butter or other shortening
1 c  Finely sieved, freshly
-cooked potato
2 c  Scalded milk, cooled to
-lukewarm
2 ea Eggs, slightly beaten
Sprinkle or crumble yeast into measuring cup with the 1 tsp sugar. Add
lukewarm water to make 1/2 cup; stir to dissolve. Sift flour, measure
4 cups, and sift again with salt into a large mixing bowl. Add
shortening and potato. Stir in milk. Add yeast mixture and mix
thoroughly. Cover and allow to rise in a warm place about 2 1/2 hours
or until almost doubled. Beat risen dough slightly. Add eggs, the 1
cup sugar, 4 Tbsp melted butter, and the 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Sift the
remaining flour and gradually add enough (about 4 cups), stirring, to
make a soft dough. Turn out on a lightly floured board, and knead
until smooth. Place in greased bowl, cover, and allow to rise in a
warm place until double, about 1 hour. Punch down; divide into 4
parts. On lightly floured board, roll out each part into a rectangle
about 9 by 12 inches. Spread each with an equal amount of the 6 tbsp
butter, and sprinkle with an equal amount of the 1/2 cup sugar mixed
with the 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Mix together raisins, candied cherries,
chopped nuts, and citron. Divide evenly among the 4 portions of
dough; spread over the surface of each, leaving about a one inch
margin on all sides. Roll as you would a jelly, starting from a 9
inch side (press firmly but gently as you roll to avoid air spaces).
Fold ends under to seal. Place each loaf in a buttered loaf pan (5 by
9 inch) with a few almonds scattered on the bottom. Dip additional
almonds in beaten egg and press on top of each loaf to make a
pattern. Cover loaves, and allow to rise in a warm place until almost
double in bulk, about 1 hour. Bake at 350-F for 45 minutes or until
brown. Turn out onto wire rack, then turn upright; brush generously
with butter and let cool. Wrap airtight; to freeze loaves, seal in
foil. Slice to serve.
