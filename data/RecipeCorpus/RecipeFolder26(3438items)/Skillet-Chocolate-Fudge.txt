4 tb Butter
1 1/2 ts Vanilla*
1/4 ts =1/8 teaspoon salt
3 c  Sugar; minus 1 Tablespoon
1 c  Half-and-half
1/4 c  Light corn syrup
5 1/2 oz Unsweetened baking chocolate    1 1/4 c  Pecans; coarsely chopped
-cut into chunks
In a large, heavy bottomed frying pan, mix sugar and half-and-half.
Bring to boil over low heat, then add corn syrup and stir gently a
few times. Insert candy thermometer and cook, without stirring, until
it registers between 236 and 238 degrees. (On humid or rainy days, or
if your kitchen is humid, cook to the higher temperature.) Do not
remove thermometer. Remove frying pan from heat and allow to cool;
sprinkle chocolate pieces over hot syrup and add chunk of butter, but
DO NOT STIR. Do not move or agitate syrup in any way. Allow chocolate
and butter to melt. When syrup has cooled to 110 degrees on candy
thermometer, remove thermometer. Spoon and scrape contents of pan
into bowl of electric mixer. Add vanilla and salt and turn mixer on
to low speed.  Beat until candy begins to harden. Immediately scrape
and spoon candy out of mixing bowl onto flat surface;it will still be
warm.  With both hands, knead candy hard for a moment, then knead in
pecans. Line an 8x8-inch square pan with plastic wrap. Press fudge
firmly into pan, flattening it on top, and pressing it into corners.
Cover tightly and let sit for about 6 to 8 hours or overnight. Remove
fudge from square pan with aid of plastic wrap. With a sharp knife,
cut fudge into 8 lengthwise rows.  Then make 6 more rows at right
angles to first cuts. *Note: if peppermint fudge is desired, omit
vanilla and substitute 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract or to taste.
