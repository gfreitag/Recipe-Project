"I was bored making the
-usual London broil, so I
-got a little
Creative and sparked up the
-flavor with crushed red
Pepper, garlic and
-Worcestershire sauce." -
With a meat fork, poke holes in both sides of meat.  Make a paste with
garlic, seasoned salt and red pepper; rub over both sides of meat.
Place steak in a gallon-size plastic bag. Add Worcestershire sauce
and close bag. Refrigerate at least 4 hours, turning once. Remove
meat; discard marinade. Broil or grill over hot coals until meat
reaches desired doneness, 4-5 minutes per side.  To serve, slice
thinly across the grain. Serves: 2 From: "Taste of Home" Magazine,
