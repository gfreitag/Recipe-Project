The Greeks wrap coins in foil and knead them into this bread.  They
believe anyone who finds a coin will have good luck in the coming
year. 2 tbsp dry yeast 1/4 cup warm water 1/2 tsp each.. cinnamon,
anise seeds, orange peel 1 bay leaf 1 ounce ouzo (optional) 1/2 cup
water 1/2 cup hot milk 1/4 pound butter 7 cups unbleached flour,
unsifted 1 cup sugar 1/2 tsp salt 3 eggs 12 walnut halves Dissolve
yeast in warm water and set aside. Put spices, orange peel, bay leaf,
and ouzo in a pot with the 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil. Set
aside to steep and cool. Heat milk and remove from heat. Add the
butter and allow the milk to cool slightly. Put the flour, sugar, and
salt in a large bowl.  Mix in eggs, yeast, milk mixture, and flavored
water (remove only the bay leaf)  Stir the mixture until all the
flour has been absorbed.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
board and knead until smooth, about 20 minutes.  Place in a buttered
bowl, and flip the dough so the top is greased as well.  Cover with a
towel dampened with hot water. Set in a warm, draft free place to
rise until doubled in bulk, about 4-6 hours.  Punch down the dough
and knead for about 5 minutes. Shape into one large round loaf and
decorate the top with walnut halves. Set aside to rise once more,
about 2 hours (uncovered). Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 1 hour.
