Title: Quick Burger Mix

A variation on the burger mixes... I mixed the Felafel mix acc. to
directions (add water, wait 15 mins) and then made them into patties
and browned a couple of minutes on each side on nonstick pans. My
mother & I thought it was delicious :-) altho maybe not very
original. As lowfat as chickpeas are (I forget exactly but it says on
the box), fairly cheap if you buy in bulk or on sale.
