Remove the fruit from the membranes by cutting the whole grapefruit in
half, then using a sharp knife to loosen the sections - faster than it
sounds. Squeeze the juice into a small bowl with the fruit.

Grate in a small clove of garlic, add 2 T. olive oil, the vinegar and
raspberries. Add a few grindings from a peppermil.

Wash, trim and drain the individual Romaine leaves. Tear into 2 in.
pieces and put in a large serving bowl.

When ready to serve, pour the dressing over the lettuce and toss.
This is a juicy salad, so a little care is appropriate.
