Cut any fat from pork chops. Season with salt and pepper. Roll chops
in bread crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper. Fry chops in hot
butter, margarine or oil until brown on both sides. Add 1/2 cup of
water and cook over low heat, covered, 45 to 60 mins., or until
tender. Meanwhile, combine cherries, sugar, cinnamon, lemon rind and
honey and bring to a boil. Lower heat and cook 5 mins. Add a little
water to thin, if desired. Stir in Madeira and remove from stove.
Serve over cooked chops. Serves 6.

interesting variations.  One of their great holiday treets is
roast suckling pig stuffed with kasha.  Other typical pork

substituted for the cherries, if desired.
