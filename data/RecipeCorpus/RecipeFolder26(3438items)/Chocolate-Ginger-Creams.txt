-recipe
1 1/2 ts Syrup from a jar of stem
-ginger
Knead the fondant until pliable, gradually working in the ginger
syrup. Roll out to 1/2" thick on a board lightly dusted with icing
sugar. Cut out shapes, using the same cutter each time. Leave to dry
on parchment. When the centers are thoroughly dry, break the
chocolate into a bowl and melt it over a pan of hot water. Add a
little fat if necessary to achieve a dipping consistency. Using a
dipping ring, dip the ginger creams one at a time in the chocolate to
give them a generous coating. Place on parchment. Before the
chocolate dries, place a tiny sliver of crystallized ginger in the
center of each one. Leave to dry.
