Combine honey and sugar in a bowl; mix well. Add eggs; beat well. Sift
flour, soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger into mixture; stir well. Add
enough flour to make a stiff dough. Shape into a ball and refrigerate
for 2 hours. Roll out on a floured board to a 1/4 inch thickness and
cut with a round cookie cutter about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Brush
top of each cookie with egg white and press a almond into the center.
Arrange on greased cookie sheets and bake in a preheated moderate
oven (375Â°F.) for 12 to 15 mins. Makes about 4 dozen.

NOTES : One of Poland's finest products is its honey, which over the
years
has been used in making a large number of good dishes such as
these flavorful cookies.
