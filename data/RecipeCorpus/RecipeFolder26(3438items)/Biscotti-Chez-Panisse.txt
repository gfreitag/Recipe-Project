butter with the sugar in a large bowl. Beat in the eggs and mix well.
Add the vanilla and Cognac. In another bowl, stir together the flour,
baking powder, and salt. Add to the butter mixture with the chopped
nuts. Stir just until combined. On a lightly floured surface, roll
the dough into cylinders about 1 1/2 inches wide and 12 inches long.

25 minutes, until lightly browned on top. Remove from the oven and
let cool for about 5 minutes. Carefully remove the cylinders to a
cutting board. Slice the cookies about 1/2 inch wide on the diagonal.
Return them to the baking sheet, the cut surfaces down. Bake for 5-10
minutes, until the tops are lightly browned. Let cool and store in an
airtight container. NOTE: It is also delicious to add about 2
teaspoons of anise seed to the doughIngredients:
