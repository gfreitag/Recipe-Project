Title: Chocolate Orange Creams
Categories: Candy, Fruit, Chocolate
Yield: 12 ounces
1/4 oz Vegetable fat
Candied orange peel, to
-decorate
8 oz Basic fondant-see recipe
3 dr Oil of Orange
Orange food coloring
7 oz Milk chocolate
Knead the fondant until pliable, gradually working in the oil of
orange and a very little coloring, just to tint it a pale orange.
Roll out the fondant to about 1/2" thick on a board lightly dusted
with icing sugar. Cut out shapes, using the same cutter each time.
Leave the fondants to dry on parchment. When the centers are
thoroughly dry, break the chocolate into a bowl and melt it over a
pan of hot water. Add a little vegetable fat if necessary to achieve
a dipping consistency. Using a dipping ring, dip the orange creams
one at a time in the chocolate to give them a generous coating. Place
on parchment. Before the chocolate dries, place a small piece of
candied orange peel in the center of each one. Leave to dry.
