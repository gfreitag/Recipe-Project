Title: Chicken Stock 2
Categories: Native amer, Chicken, Vegetable
Yield: 5 quarts
2 md Yellow onions, quartered
1    Bunch fresh parsley
3    Bay leaves
1    Bunch fresh thyme
8 qt Water
2 lg Chicken carcasses
4    Celery stalks, coarsely
-chopped
4 lg Carrots, coarsely chopped
2 lg Leeks, coarsely chopped
Combine all the ingredients in a large stockpot and bring to a boil
over medium heat.  Reduce heat to low and simmer about 1 hour,
skimming off the fat as it rises to the surface.  Continue simmering
over low hat until the stock has been reduced by one third and the
flavor has intensified.

Remove from the heat and carefully strain the stock through a sieve
lined with a cheesecloth.  Discard the contents of the sieve.  Pour
the stock into a container and let cool.  Then place the stock in the
refrigerator for 3 hours.  Remove the solidified fat from the top.
The stock will keep 5 days in a covered container.

Although Chicken Stock tastes better fresh, it can also be frozen in
ice cube trays; store the cubes in plastic bags in the freezer up to
2 months. Larger quantities of stock can be poured directly into
plastic bags and stored in the freezer.
