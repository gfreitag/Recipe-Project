Drain and rinse the beans.  Place them in the cooker with the water,
oil, leeks, carrots, celery, bay leaves and tarragon.  Lock the lid
in place. Over high heat, bring  to high pressure.  Lower the heat
just enough to maintain high pressure, and cook for 8 minutes.  Allow
the pressure to come down naturally, (by turning off heat & allow to
sit until pressure in naturally released) or use a quick-release
method. (Running pressure cooker under cold water to release the
pressure). If the beans are not quite tender, either return to high
pressure for another minute or two or replace lid (but do not lock)
the lid and simmer until the beans are done. Remove the bay leaves
and add salt. (to taste) If the soup is too thin, with slotted spoon,
transfer about 1 cup of the beans to a food processor or blender, and
puree. Stir the puree back into the soup. Source: The San Diego
