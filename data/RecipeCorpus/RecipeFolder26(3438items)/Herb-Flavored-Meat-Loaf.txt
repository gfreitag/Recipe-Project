Title: Herb Flavored Meat Loaf
Categories: Game, Meatloaf, Herbs/spice
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Soft bread crumbs
8 t  Rosemary
2 c  Skim milk
1/4 t  Basil
2 T  Parsley, chopped fine
1/2 t  Paprika
1 lb Ground venison or moosemeat
1/4 t  Pepper
1 ea Clove garlic, chopped fine
1 ea Egg slightly beaten
1 t  Salt
2 T  Grated onion
1/4 t  Oregano
Soak bread crumbs in milk. Combine all ingredients and mix
thoroughly. Make into a loaf in a loaf pan. Bake for one hour in
moderate oven 350?. Serve hot or cold. When cold it can be thinly
sliced for cold buffet. Makes four generous servings. I like this for
its flavoring. Meat loaf sometimes can be dry and tasteless. Also
this seasoning helps should the wild meat have a strong flavor.
