Title: Karnabeet Makly (Deep-Fried Cauliflower)
Categories: Middle east, Arab states, Appetizer, Vegetable
Yield: 6 servings
;frying
Taratoor Sauce
1 lg Cauliflower; (2 to 2 1/2 lbs
1 ts Salt
Oil or shortening; for deep
Cut away the thick stem at the base of the cauliflower and remove
the green leaves.  Break the florets off the center core and cut the
core into 1 inch cubes.  Wash the florets and cubes under cold
running water.
In a 3 to 4 quart enameled or stainless steel saucepan, bring 1
quart of water and the salt to a boil over high heat.  Drop in the
cauliflower and cook briskly, uncovered, for 10 minutes, or until the
pieces are tender but still somewhat resistant to the point of a
small, sharp knife. Drain in a sieve or colander.
In a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet with a deep frying thermometer or
in an electric skillet, heat 1 or 2 inches of the oil or shortening
until it reaches a temperature of 375 degrees.  Pat the cauliflower
completely dry with paper towels, and a dozen or so pieces at a time,
fry them in the hot oil for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown
on all sides. As they brown, remove them with a slotted spoon and
drain them on paper towels. They may be served hot or at room
temperature.
In either case, mound the cauliflower on a platter and spread the
taratoor  over it.
