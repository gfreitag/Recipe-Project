~------------------------------------------------------------------

Deep fry the wing pieces( in small batches) in hot oil at 385 deg for
10 minutes, or follow package directions. Drain on paper towels;
sprinkle with black pepper while draining.  While chicken is frying,
melt margarine in large skillet; mix in hot sauce, garlic salt,  and
cayenne. As Chicken is drained, toss into the sauce skillet and mix
in. When all chicken is in the sauce, dash in paprika, mix again and
allow to stand for a while. Heat the Buffalo Wing Sauce and cover the
chicken with it just before serving. Serve with celery sticks and
Blue Cheese Dip. Submitted By NICK LA ROCCA   On   12-19-94
