8 T  Butter (=1 stick)
1/4 c  Cold water
1 3/4 c  All purpose flour
1/4 t  Salt
Place the flour, salt, and butter in the bowl of a food processor.
Process until the dough resembles meal.  (A pastry cutter may be used
instead of the food processor.)  Add water and process until the
dough forms a ball on the blade.  Roll the dough out 1/4-inch thick
and cut into 2-inch rounds. Line miniature tart pans with the dough
Gruyere cheese,
rounds. Filling: 4 oz smoked salmon 5 oz
shredded finely 4 each eggs, beaten 1 1/2 cups milk 1/2 cup whipping
cream 1/4 tsp salt 1/4 tsp pepper Blot the smoked salmon slices with
a paper towel to remove excess moisture and then cut the slices into
1-inch slivers. Divide the slivered salmon among the tart shells and
springle the cheese over each. Mix the eggs, milk, and cream with the
salt and pepper and pour into each tart shell. Bake the tarts (place
individual tart pans on a baking sheet) in a preheated 400 degrees F
oven for about 15 minutes.  Keep checking during baking since the
tarts are small and take much less time than would a larger tart.
Serves 6 to 8. (Makes 16 two-inch tarts.) From: SERVE WITH CHAMPAGNE
