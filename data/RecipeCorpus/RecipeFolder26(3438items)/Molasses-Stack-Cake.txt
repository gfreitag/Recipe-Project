Title: Molasses Stack Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Apples, Herbs/spice
Yield: 10 servings
1 t  Ground cloves
1 t  Ginger
1 t  Nutmeg
3/4 c  Buttermilk
2 t  Baking soda
3/4 c  Brown sugar
3/4 c  Shortening
3/4 c  Molasses
3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
1 t  Cinnamon
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
2 c  Sugar
2 lb Dried apples
Cream together sugar and shortening.  Add eggs and beat well.  Stir in
molasses.  Sift flour spices.  Mix buttermilk with baking soda (begin
with 3/4 cup buttermilk.  You may not need to use all of this amount
in the mixing process to get the dough to the right consistency). Add
flour mixture and buttermilk mixture alternately to creamed mixture
until the batter is of a cookie dough consistency. Pat a thin layer
of batter into a greased, warm skillet (about the thickness of a
pizza crust). Bake in a 375 degree oven fo 10 to 15 minutes or until
done. Repeat for other layers. Meanwhile add just enough water to the
dried apples to cook them so they won't scorch. Sweeten with sugar
and set mixture aside. While still warm, make cake by stacking the
layers with cooked apple filling. (As you each layer, add the filling
and keep stacking the layers. Make sure to save enough filling for
the top of the cake).
