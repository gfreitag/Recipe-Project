Title: Tvp Hash (Janet)
Categories: Main dish, Fatfree
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 c  Water
1/4 c  Rice
2    3 teaspoons vegetable stock
1 T  Parsley
-cumin*
-chilli*
-tabasco
-pepper
2 lg Onions, coarsely chopped.
1 sm Green pepper, coarsely
-chopped
-garlic, minced {lots}
-kidney beans
1/2 c  Tvp
1/2 c  Frozen corn kernels
1 cn Tomatoes, coarsely chopped
Water saute the onions,pepper & garlic. Add the cumin and chilli and
continuing cooking. Combine the rest of the ingredients and simmer
for 20 minutes. {Sometimes (since the amounts are approximate) the
mixture comes out soupy..in cases like this I add 1/4 cup bulger
wheat and let simmer a few more minutes...this usually absorbs the
rest of the liquid}

*I don't usually measure such spices as they're my favorite and I can
never add too much it seems.
