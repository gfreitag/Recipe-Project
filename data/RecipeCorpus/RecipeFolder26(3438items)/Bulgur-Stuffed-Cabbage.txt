Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
2    15-oz cans tomato sauce
4 c  Water
2 c  Dry bulgur
1    8-oz can tomato sauce
1/2 c  Water
1 sm Head green cabbage
1 c  Finely chopped parsley
2    Onions, chopped
4    Celery stalks, chopped
1/4 t  Italian seasoning
1/2 t  Minced garlic
Remove core from cabbage, place cabbage head in steamer and steam
until all leaves are soft and separate easily.  Saute parsley,
onions, celery, seasoning, and garlic in oil substitute until onions
are soft.  Add 2 15-oz. cans of tomato sauce, 4 cups water and
bulgur. Cook about 1/2 hr. over medium heat, stirring occasionally,
until bulgur is tender. Remove from heat. To stuff cabbage leaves,
place a spoonful of mixture in center of each leaf. Starting at one
side, roll leaf up and fold ends under. Place in a deep baking pan.
Mix the 8 oz can of tomato sauce with 1/2 cup water and pour over
stuffed cabbage leaves so they remain moist during baking. Bake at
375 for about 30 min. until cabbage is hot.
