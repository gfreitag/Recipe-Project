Title: Pita De Zeboya (Onion Pie)
Categories: Main dish, Pie/tart, Vegetable
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Bread crumbs
2 lg Eggs, beaten
7    Sheets
-oil for painting fillo
-fillo dough
3 tb Corn oil
1 lb Onion, peeled and coarsely
-chopped
1/4 ts Pepper
1/4 lb Feta cheese, mashed up
Fillo sheet are delicate and must be handled with care so that they
do not crumble.  Dribbling a few drops of oil here and there on the
sheets encourages crispness.

1.  In 3 tablespoon of corn oil, saute the onions and pepper in a
covered pan over low heat for about 20 minutes so the onions will
cook down. Stir the mixture now and then.  Cool for 15 minutes.

2.  Mix in the cheese, bread crumbs, and all but 1 tablespoon of the
beaten eggs.  Set aside.

3.  Oil a heatproof glass or metal baking dish.  Take 3 fillo sheets,
one at a time, oiling and fitting one after the other on the bottom
of the baking dish, and bringing each sheet up around the inside of
the dish as though it were a pie crust.  Pour the onion/cheese
mixture into the dish. Cover with the remaining 4 sheets of fillo,
oiling each with a pastry brush as before.  Oil the last sheet up to
and around the edges. Paint the entire top with the reserved
tablespoon of egg.

Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for about 40 minutes, or until
the top is crisp and brown.  At this stage it is possible to lift up
one corner of the pie with a metal spatula to see if the fillo bottom
has browned.

Serve warm, cut into slices or squares.  Serves 6.
