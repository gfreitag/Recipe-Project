Form dough into a disc shape. Wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate at
least 30 minutes.

Stewed Chicken: In a 4 quart saucepan combine chicken, celery leaves,

cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat. Cover and simmer
for 45 minutes to one hour until chicken is very tender. Remove
chicken with tongs and cool. Strain broth and refrigerate. When
chicken is cool enough to handle, discard skin and remove meat from
bones. Cut meat in pieces. Wrap and refrigerate.

Cream Sauce: Skim fat from top of cold broth. Measure 1/4 cup into
medium saucepan, or melt butter. Add onion and  saute until
transparent, 3-5 minutes. Stir in 1/3 cup flour, 1/2 ts salt and 1/4
ts pepper. Mix well.
