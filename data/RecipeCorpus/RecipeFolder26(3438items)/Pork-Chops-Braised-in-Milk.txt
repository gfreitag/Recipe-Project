Title: Pork Chops Braised in Milk
Categories: Pork, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 t  Salt
1/4 ea To 1/2 tsp  ground pepper
1 1/2 c  Low-fat milk, divided
1 t  Margarine
4 ea 6-ounce boneless pork loin
-chops (about 1/2 inch
-thick)
2 T  All purpose flour
Trim the fat from the chops.  Combine the flour, salt and pepper in a
large zip-top plastic bag.  Add the chops, seal the bag, and shake to
coat the chops with the flour mixture.  Remove the chops from the bag
and reserve the remaining flour mixture to a small bowl.  Gradually
add 1/2 cup of the milk to the flour mixture, stirring with a wire
whisk until blended.

Melt the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the
chops and cook for 3 minutes on each side or until browned.  Add the
milk-flour mixture.  Cover and reduce the heat to low; cook, stirring
occasionally, for 30 minutes.  Turn the chops over.  Add the
remaining cup of milk. Cover and cook for 30 minutes, stirring
occasionally.

Uncover the skillet and cook the chops for an additional 15 minutes or
until the liquid is reduced to 1/4 cup, making a very thick sauce.
Spoon the sauce over the chops and serve.
