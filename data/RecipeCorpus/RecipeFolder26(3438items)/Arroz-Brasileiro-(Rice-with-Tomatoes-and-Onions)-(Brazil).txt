In a heavy 3- to 4-qt sauce pan, heat the oil over moderate heat for
30 seconds, tipping the pan to coat the bottom evenly. Add the onion
and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes or until it is soft and
transparent but not brown.  Pour in the rice and stir for 2 to 3

rice brown. Add the stock, water, tomatoes and salt, and return to a
boil, still stirring. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to its lowest
point. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed all the
liquid.  If the rice must wait, drape the pan loosely with a towel
and keep it warm in a preheated 250 degree oven. Serves 8 - 10. From:
