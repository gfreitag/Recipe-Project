Recipe by: KKPD13B    Linda Caldwell As many of you know, I'm excited
about using Donna German's new book WORLDWIDE SOURDOUGHS FROM YOUR
BREAD MACHINE. the information in this book is of interest to "by
hand" bakers, too. Here's an example! "If the culture has not been
used in a month or so, it may require 1 or 2 feedings prior to using
to bring it back >>> up to its fast rising capacity. The more often
the culture is used, the faster it is, and the better it will rise.
1.Remove the culture from the refrigerator 2.Divide the culture in
half, placing each half in its own 1 quart wide mouth jar or plastic
container 3. Add 1/2 C warm (95f to 100f) water and 1/2 C white bread
flour to each of the cultures. 4. Place lid on jars but do not fasten
tightly. 5. Place jars in proofing box at 85f. Leave jars in proofing
box until foamy bubbles appear. This may take a few >>> hours or
from one to several days depending on how long the culture was
dormant. I'll put information on making a "proofing box" under its
own later. My starter's out on the kitchen counter and has just been
fed. Since it wasn't used for almost a month while I was away it may
take a while to get it ready to use. If it foams up soon, I'll make a
loaf today without the commercial yeast. It DOES take a while but is
