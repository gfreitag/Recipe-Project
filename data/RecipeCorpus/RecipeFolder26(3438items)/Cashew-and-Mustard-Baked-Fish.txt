Title: Cashew and Mustard-Baked Fish
Categories: Fish, Nuts/grains, Main dish
Yield: 4 servings
1 1/2 tb Canola or mustard oil
1 tb Water
1 1/2 lb Fish fillets or steaks *
-cut into 2" strips
Salt (opt)
4 c  Basmati rice, cooked
2 ts Black mustard seeds
1 tb Raw cashews; unsalted
-about 1 oz
1 tb Sweetened coconut
-shredded or flaked
1/4 ts Turmeric
* salmon, tuna, swordfish, shrimp

Put the mustard seeds, cashews and coconut in a blender or food
processor and grind to a coarse powder. Transfer the powder to a
large bowl with the turmeric, oil and water and mix well. Toss the
fish in this mixture, making sure each piece is well coated. Cover
and marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to
350Ã¸F.

Put the fish and marinade in a lightly oiled baking dish and cover
tightly with a piece of aluminum foil. Bake until the fish is just
opaque through (cut to test), 15 to 25 minutes. Turn on the broiler
and discard the foil from the dish. Broil the fish a few inches from
the heat just until the top is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Taste
sauce for seasoning, adding salt if necessary. Spoon the fish and
sauce over basmati rice and serve.
