MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
1/2 lb Corned beef, thinly sliced
1/2 lb Swiss cheese, thinly sliced
1/2 c  Thousand Island dressing
1 ea 16-oz can sauerkraut,

IN medium saucepan, combine corn meal and beer.  Heat to boiling and
simmer for 2 minutes.  Stir in butter and salt.  Cool to 105-115 F.
Stir in yeast, sugar and honey and let stand for 5 minutes. Pour
mixture into large mixing bowl and add 2 cups of bread flour,
stirring until well blended. Add rye flour and caraway seeds and mix
thoroughly. Place dough on a lightly floured board and work in enough
of remaining 1/4 cup bread flour to reduce stickiness and make dough
workable.  Place dough in oiled bowl and turn to coat all sides.  Let
rise until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down and let rest for 10
minutes.  Divide dough in half, covering one piece. On a floured
surface, roll other piece into rectangle not longer than baking
sheet.  Trim dough so that rectangle is a true shape. Lightly score
dough into thirds lengthwise. Spread 1/2 dressing over the center
third, leaving 1 inch at top and bottom of section uncovered. Cover
dressing with 1/2 sauerkraut, 1/2 corned beef and 1/2 cheese.  Fold 1
inch at top and bottom over filling and pinch to seal.  On each side
of filling, make cuts at 1-inch intervals.  Cuts begin 1/2 inch from
filling and go to outer edges. Beginning on right, pull top strip
across middle and seal end on other side of filling.  Pull top left
strip across middle and seal; alternate in braiding fashion until all
strips are secured. Repeat with other ball of dough.  Cover and let
rest for 30 minutes.  Place on greased baking sheet and bake at 350 F
for 30 minutes.  Slice to serve. Creme de Colorado Cookbook (1987)
