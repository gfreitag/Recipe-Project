Have oxtails cut into pieces at the joints by the butcher. Trim off
excess fat from them and wash or wipe them. Melt the butter in a
large stewpan and brown the oxtails lightly. Remove them from the
pan, and reserve. Add the ham and the cut up vegetables to the same
pan and sweat them well with the herbs and pepper corns. Return the
oxtails to the pan and add the water & stock, and the halved or
quartered onions, stuck with their cloves.

Bring to the boil, and simmer very gently for at least 4 hours, until
the meat is really falling off the bones (Up to 8 hours or overnight
is quite acceptable). Remove the pieces of oxtail carefully, making
sure that not too much of the meat is lost. Separate the meat from
the fat and bones, discarding the two latter. Cut the meat into
chunks as best you can and reserve. Strain the soup base, and allow
to cool overnight.

Next day, remove the supernatant fat, which will have solidified, and
add the oxtail meat. Shortly before serving, mix the port and flour
to a smooth cream, and pour in some of the soup, to dilute. Add this
mixture to the soup, and bring, stirring, to the boil. Correct
seasoning, simmer for around 5 mins form the flour to lose its raw
taste, and serve. Submitted By IAN HOARE   On   12-24-94
