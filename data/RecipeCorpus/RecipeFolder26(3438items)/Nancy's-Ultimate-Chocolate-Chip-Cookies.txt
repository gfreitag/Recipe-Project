Title: Nancy's Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie, Chocolate, Homemade
Yield: 1 servings
1 t  Salt
3/4 t  Baking soda
1 c  Chocolate chips (or more)
1 c  Nuts, Optional
3/4 c  Golden flavour crisco
1 1/4 c  Sugar (lightly packed brown)
1 ea Egg
2 T  Milk
1 3/4 c  Flour
Preheat oven to 365F. (my oven likes this temp) Cream crisco and brown
sugar together until light and fluffy.  Add egg and milk, beating
thoroughly until blended.  Combine dry ingredients and add to creamed
mixture.  Add chocolate chips and nuts. (I foil my cookie sheets as
they are old and dark colored.) Spray with pam and bake for 11
minutes. Cookies may still appear a little soft when taking them out.
Let them sit for a minute or two before taking them off the pan.
Origin: Nancy Cunningham adapted this recipe for my oven, 1992.
