Title: Dehydrating Mushrooms

The first step is to try to pick your mushrooms 'clean' - cut them
off at ground level and brush off loose dirt and leaves.  No need to
wash them if you spread them on tray and allow them to dry about a
day (until surface is no longer sticky), you can easily brush off any
remaining dirt. Trim if necessary.  Replace trays and allow the clean
mushrooms to dry thoroughly.

Don't let the initial drying take too long, or the dirt will befirmly
embedded as the mushrooms shrivel. If your mushrooms have come from
the grocery store, you'll probably want to wash them before
dehydrating. Allow them to drain on a towel before putting into
dryer. Origin: Dry It - You'll Like It!  circa 1973. Shared by:
