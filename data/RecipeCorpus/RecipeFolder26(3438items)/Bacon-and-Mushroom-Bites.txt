Ts dried thyme
1/2 ts Chopped fresh sage, or 1/4
Ts. dried
1/3 c  Chopped walnuts
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tb Vegetable oil
8    Large slices of bacon
2 c  Finely chopped mushrooms

Preheat the oven to 375.  Melt margarine in skillet, add the onion
and cook gently for about 5 minutes until soft and lightly colored.
Add the mushrooms to the skillet and cook for a further 2 minutes,
then remove from heat. Stir the bread crumbs into the skillet with
half the parsley, the thyme, sage, walnuts and seasoning to taste.
Stretch out the bacon slices on a board and flatten them with the
back of a knife. Divide the mushroom mixture into 8 portions.  Place
a portion on each bacon slice and roll up like a jelly roll.  Secure
the end of each roll with a toothpick. Arrange the bacon rolls in a
single layer in a heatproof dish, spoon the oil over evenly, and bake
in the oven for 20-25 minutes. Remove the toothpicks and arrange the
rolls on a warmed serving dish. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley
and serve at once.
