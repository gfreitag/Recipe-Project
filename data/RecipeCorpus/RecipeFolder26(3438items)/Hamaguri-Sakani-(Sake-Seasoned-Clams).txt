Have the clams shucked by your fish man and ask him to save the
shells. Discard the shallower halves and scrub the deeper halves of
the shell thoroughly.  Drop them into boiling water, boil for 2 to 3
minutes, then drain.  Rinse each shell under cold running water and
pat dry. Over high heat bring the sake to a boil in a 1 quart
saucepan. Sprinkle with MSG, then drop in the clams, stir gently, and
cover. Cook over moderately high heat for 3 to 4 minutes, remove the
clams with tongs or chopsticks, and place one in each of the reserved
shells.  Garnish each clam with a half slice of lemon, and serve at
room temperature.
