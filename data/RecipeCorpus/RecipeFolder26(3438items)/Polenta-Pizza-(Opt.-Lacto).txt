Title: Polenta Pizza (Opt. Lacto)
Categories: Fatfree, Vegetable, Pizza, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
x  Ff mozarella (opt)
x  Polenta
x  Vegetables of choice
Have one of those boxes of polenta at home (the tube stuff doesn't
really work for this.  If you want to make it more from scratch, feel
free!). Make it. While it sits on the stove top, chop up veggies.
Red, green, and yellow peppers are 'fun' (wheeeeee), while mushrooms
and onions tend to be 'on hand'.  When the polenta is ready, pour
into a pyrex pan (round, square, heck even non-Pyrex is fine so long
as it is flat). Cover with spagetti sauce and veggies.  Bake. Eat. My
less ff female friend (less ffff???) puts low fat skim mozarella on
it, I don't. Enjoy!
