Cut gashes in meat. With a larding needle, insert strips of bacon into
gashes. Tie meat with string and place in a crock or kettle. Add next
8 ingredients; cover with equal parts of red wine vinegar and water.
Leave to marinate for 24 hours. Turn over 1 or 2 times during
marinating. Spoon vegetables, seasonings and liquid into a shallow
baking dish; place meat on top of them. Roast, uncovered, in a
preheated moderate oven (325Â°F.) , allowing 35 to 40 mins per pound,
to desired degree of doneness. When finished cooking, remove from
oven. Take meat from the pan. Keep warm. Strain drippings and liquid.
Put strained liquid into a saucepan; stir in flour. Cook slowly,
stirring with a whisk or fork, until thickened. Add sour cream; leave
on stove long enough to heat. Slice meat and serve covered with
sauce. Serves 8.

NOTES : This meat dish, commonly called Svickova, has an appealing
sweet-sour flavor.
