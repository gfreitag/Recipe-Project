Title: Deep Fry Batter
Categories: Dip, Crab/shrimp, Chicken
Yield: 1 servings
1/4 c  Vinegar
1 1/2 c  Flour
(1-3/4 for shrimp)
1 c  Water
1/2 t  Salt
1 t  Baking powder
1/2 t  Baking soda
Mix together and wait until batter starts to bubble.  Beat hard until
it settles.  Dip desired item and deep fry immediately. I use this
batter to make my boneless pork.  Dip and deep fry.  Keep warm in
oven, and then serve sweet and sour sauce over.  These stay nice and
crisp/crunchy. Have also used this for deep fried shrimp, and for
chicken pieces. Origin: Sharon Stevens Shared by: Sharon Stevens,
