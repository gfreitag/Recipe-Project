Title: Cream of Tomato Soup 2
Categories: British, Soup/stew, Vegetable, Tomato
Yield: 4 servings
1 l  Stock
Salt, pepper
300 ml Cream
Chopped chives or basil
1 kg Ripe tomatoes
100 g  Chopped onions
125 g  Chopped young carrots
Bouquet garni
Simmer the vegetables and bouquet with 3/4 of the stock until they are
tender. Remove the bouquet garni and purÂ‚e the soup in the blender or
sieve until it is very smooth. Taste, add seasoning and remaining
stock. If it is to be served cold, stir in the cream and chill. If it
is to be served hot, bring the cream to the boil in a clean pan and
add the soup gradually. In both cases serve sprinkled with chives or
better, chopped basil. If you like a spicy flavour, add nutmeg to the
soup as it cooks and sprinkle a little on top when it is served.

Modifications for sterilising

Do not season. Blend the soup, then sieve. Pour into 1l strilising
jars, and seal and sterilise in the usual way. When reheating, season
then bring 200ml cream to the boil and pour in the boiling soup
gradually. You may have to reblend to cure possible curdling.
