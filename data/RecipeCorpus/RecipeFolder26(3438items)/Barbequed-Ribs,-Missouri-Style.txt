Combine salt, sugar, cumin, pepper, chili powder and paprika to make
barbecue rub. Rub ribs thoroughly with mixture. Place ribs on baking
sheets and cook in 180-degree oven 3 hours. Do not turn; slow cooking
infuses spices. Remove from oven. (Ribs may be covered and
refrigerated up to 2 days before grilling.) Use very low charcoal
fire with rack set as high as possible. Grill ribs 5 minutes to 30
minutes per side, depending on heat and temperature of ribs. Ribs
should have light outer crust and be heated throughout. (Longer
cooking produces better ribs.) If you prefer juicy ribs, coat with
Basting Sauce just before removing from grill. Otherwise serve dry
with sauce on side. Remove ribs from grill, cut in between bones and
serve. Makes 5 servings. Note: Recipe is easily halved or doubled.
Keep 2:1 proportion of sauce to rub. Basting Sauce 1 3/4 cups white
vinegar 2 tbs hot pepper sauce 2 tbs sugar 1 tbs salt 1 tbs ground
black pepper Combine vinegar, hot pepper sauce, sugar, salt and
pepper in bowl. Makes 2 cups.
