Title: Asparagus & Red Pepper Soup
Categories: Vegetarian, Fatfree
Yield: 4 servings
-diced(1/3-1/2 cup total)
1 cn Evap skim milk
-x pepper to taste
2 lb Asparagus, trimmed, cut into
1    " pieces
2 c  Veggie broth
1    Roasted red pepper
1. Place asparagus and broth into 4 qt pan and simmer for 15 min.,
until tender.

2. Puree asparagus/broth in blender. Take out some pieces for a
chunkier consistency if you wish.

3. Put puree back in pan and add red pepper, any reserved asparagus,
black pepper, and can of milk.

4. Heat until thickened to your liking.

NOTE: You can add some thickener(flour,cornstarch) to hasten the
process. I started the pepper roasting at about the same time as the
the asparagus, and it worked out fine to add to soup.

Serve with a salad and hearty bread!
