Categories: Main dish, African, Beef, Vegetable
Yield: 4 servings
3 tb Fresh lemon juice
1 c  Well-washed chopped
-spinach
1    Fresh hot chile pepper, such
-as jalapeno, seeded and
-chopped
1 ts Curry powder
1 ts Ground coriander seed
Leaves (about 5 ounces)
2 tb Unsalted buter, softened
1/2 c  Freshly grated coconut
(optional)
2 tb Vegetable oil
2 lb Beef chuck, cut into
1/4 c  Water
4    Medium green plantains,
-or 8 1 1/2 inch pieces
-small green (unripe)
-bananas, peeled and
-cut into 1/2-inch
-thick slices
1/2 ts Salt
1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
1    Small onion, coarsley
Chopped
In a 5-quart Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat.
Sprinkle the beef with the salt and pepper. In batches, add the beef
and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 8 to 10
minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the browned beef to a plate
and set it aside.

Add the onion and chile pepper to the Dutch oven. Reduce the heat to
medium and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened, about 3
minutes. Add the curry powder and coriander, and stir for 1 minute.
Return the beef to the Dutch oven, and stir in the water. Reduce the
heat to low and cook, covered, until the meat is tender and the
liquid has almost com- pletely evaporated, about 1 hour. (If the stew
looks as if it's drying out, add a little more water.)

Preheat the oven to 350. Lightly butter a 9-inch square baking dish.

In a large bowl, combine the plantains and spinach, and mash
together with a fork until fairly smooth. Stir in the beef stew.
Spread the mixture evenly in the prepared baking dish, and dot the
top with the butter.

Bake until the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle with
the grated coconut if desired, and serve immediately.
