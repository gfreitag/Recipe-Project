during cooking. While chicken is cooking, combine plums, garlic,
corriander or parsley and red pepper in a sauce pan; season with salt

arrange chicken on a platter and garnish with tomatoes and cucumbers.
Serve sauce separately to be pour over chicken. Serves 4.


NOTES:  In southern Russia, a favprote method of preparing poultry is
to
serve either spitted or broiled chicken with a sauce made with
green gooseberries, pounded walnuts, sour cream or fruits.
:
:
One
of the most typical sauces is tkemali, which is made with a
:
base
of wild or sour plums that grow only in the Georgian republic.
It is not possible to duplicate the recipe outside of the
:
:
region,
but a good substitute can be attempted.  This is an excellent
entree for an outdoor meal.
