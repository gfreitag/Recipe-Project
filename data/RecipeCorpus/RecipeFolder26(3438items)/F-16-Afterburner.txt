Title: F-16 Afterburner
Categories: Salsa/sauce, Chilies
Yield: 2 cups
2 c  Coarsly chopped yellow onion
14 md Garlic cloves
2 t  Fresh lemon juice
11 t  Amber or light rum
2 c  Distilled white vinegar
1/2 ts Dried oregano
1/2    Dried ancho chile
2    Fresh red Dutch, Thai,
-or Jalapeno chilies
16    Fresh Scotch bonnet or
-Habanero chilies,
-preferably orange or
-golden yellow
Submerge the ancho in hot water and soak until soft, about 20
minutes. Chop ancho finely and reserve. Roast and peel the Dutch
chile; stem, seed and chop finely.

Stem and seed the Scotch bonnets, leaving the inner membranes (and, if
desired, a few seeds). Combine Scotch bonnets with onion and garlic
in a food processor and process until very finely chopped. Combine
lemon juice, rum and vinegar in a non-reactive pan and bring to a
boil.

Pour liquid into processor, add the oregano and Dutch chile, and
process lightly. Add the ancho teaspoon by teaspoon, processing
briefly in between, pulsing only enough to obtain a smooth,
yellow-orange sauce, highlighted by red flecks. Keeps refrigerated up
to six weeks.

NOTES: Ancho peppers are very mild. I had no luck finding red jalapeno
peppers here in the American outback and red Thai peppers tend to
be much hotter than needed... so I used green jalapenos and got
green flecks instead of red. A little of this goes a long way.
