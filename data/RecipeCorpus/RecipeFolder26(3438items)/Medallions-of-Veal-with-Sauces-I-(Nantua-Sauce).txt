** Mirepoix is a mixture of diced onions, carrots, celery and leeks.

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan over medium heat.  When the oil
is very hot, add the live crayfish and saute for 1 minute.

Add the garlic bulb (halved), mirepoix, peppercorns, bay leaf and
button mushrooms.  Cook for another minute.

Add the cognac and flame the pan.  Pour the contents into a
saucepan and mash them up with a spoon.

To the sauce pan with the crayfish, add the chopped tomato,
parsley, tarragon and tomato puree.

Deglaze the saute pan with 4 cups of fish stock (enough so that it
will cover ingredients in the saucepan) and pour the contents of the
deglazed pan into the saucepan with the crayfish and vegetables.

Roughly mash the contents of the saucepan again.  Cook (boiling)
for 20 minutes.  Strain the contents of the saucepan with the
crayfish through a chinois into another saute pan.

Reduce the liquid by two thirds.  Add the cream, salt, pepper, and
cayenne pepper.  Reduce another 5 - 10 minutes to one-half.  Strain
and reserve.
