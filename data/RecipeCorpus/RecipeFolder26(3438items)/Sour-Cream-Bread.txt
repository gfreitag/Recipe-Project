1 c  Sour cream
2 1/2 c  Unbleached AP flour (I
-used Bread flour)
Scoop the sour cream into your ABM baking pan and add the flour,
brown sugar, and salt. Position the yeast according to the directions
given for your machine, unless you have a machine with its own
dispenser for leavening, in which case the yeast should be measured
into the dispenser the very last thing.

A quick bake cycle gives the best results with this recipe.

*Excellent results with my Sanyo.
