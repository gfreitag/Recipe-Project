Yield: 1 servings
(to taste)

x  (no salt necessary with the
Other seasoning)
x  Salsa or picante sauce
x  Chopped chives
1/2 sm Bag white long-cooking rice
(pinch saffron for rice -
Optional)
1 cn Progresso or Goya black
Beans
x  Cajun seasoning - Tony
Chachere's cajun seasoning
Cook the rice (adding saffron if desired).  Being Southern, I usually
cooking it about 30 minutes to get it good and sticky!

In another pot, cook the black beans, adding Tony Chachere's, pepper
and garlic to taste.

Serve in large bowls - rice, topped with black beans, topped with a
"nest" of salsa and chives.

This is my favorite quick and easy recipe, bar none.
