Title: Yaki Tori
Categories: Chicken, Japanese
Yield: 1 servings
2 T  Shoyu (soy Sauce)
1 1/2 T  Sugar
2 T  Water
Recipe taken from Japanese
-Country Cookbook by Russ
-Rudzinski
2 ea Chicken breasts
Cut breasts into cubes and marinate in the remaining ingredients for
1/2 hour or more.  Skewer on bamboo skewers and broil in broiler or
charcoal brazier for 7-8 minutes, turning once or twice.  Serve with
rice or as an hors d'oeuvre. Variations: Add a crushed garlic clove
or 1/2 teaspoon minced ginger to the marinade. In actuality you can
use any chicken pieces, in Japan I've had it with just chicken skin
and fat, (much better with the breast pieces).  You can also use
gizzard or chicken livers. Hope this helps you out!! From: Nola Wilson
