Combine eggs, milk, sugar, salt and flour in a bowl; mix until smooth.
Heat a lightly greased 7- or 8-inch skillet. Add 3 Tbs of batter all
at once; quickly tilt pan to spread evenly. Cook over medium heat
until underside is golden. Turn over with a spatula and cook on the
other side. Turn out on a warm plate and keep warm in a preheated
slow oven (250Â°F.). Continue to cook other pancakes. Spread each with
a thin layer of jam, and roll or fold over. Serve at once with
chocolate sauce and rum, heated together. Sprinkle with chopped nuts,
if desired. Serves 10 to 12.

NOTES : Mouth-watering Hungarian desserts are the palacsinta, thin
pancakes that are eaten either folded or rolled around fruit
fillings. Or, fillings can be made with ground nuts, chocolate
or
sweetened cottage cheese.
