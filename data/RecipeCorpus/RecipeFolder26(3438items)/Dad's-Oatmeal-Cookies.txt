Title: Dad's Oatmeal Cookies
Categories: Cake/cookie, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
2 c  Margarine
4 ea Eggs
4 c  Flour
1 t  Baking soda
2 c  Oatmeal
2 c  White sugar
2 c  Brown sugar
4 t  Vanilla
2 t  Baking powder
2 c  Coconut
Cream together the sugars and the margarine.  Add eggs, and beat
again. Add the dry ingredients, and the coconut.  Spoon onto an
ungreased cookie sheet and bake in a 300F oven for 10-15 minutes or
until done. These are pretty darn close to the DAD'S cookies you get
in the store. If you like a soft cookie, bake less, and if a crisp
cookie is desired, bake a bit longer. Origin:  Connie McHone, friend
