Title: Half Hour (Gicky) Pudding
Categories: Pudding
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 c  Raisins
SAUCE
2 1/2 c  Boiling water
1 c  Brown sugar
1 T  Butter or margarine
BATTER
1 c  Flour
3/4 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Milk
2 t  Baking powder
pn Of salt
Mix batter and put in 8x8 greased pan.  Boil sauce ingredients and
then pour over the batter.  Bake for 30 minutes at 350F.  The sauce
goes to the bottom and the batter floats.  Looks "gicky" so that's
what the kids called it.  Mix the whole thing in the pan that you
bake it in and save yourself some dishes.  Walnuts can be added if
desired. Origin: Mother in Law, Marg Salstrom Shared by: Sharon
