Title: Charlotte's Deviled Eggs
Categories: Side dish, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 recipe  You hard-boil your eggs, cut 'em in half, longwise, and then take the
yellow and toss it out.  Throw in some Hellman's mayonnaise, pickle
juice, lemon juice, and celery salt (that's the secret).   Mash all
this up well and then stuff it back into the whites; if you want to
be fancy, put a dash of red or black caviar on top.

(I order eggs in diners now and tell 'em to throw out one of the
yolks.
