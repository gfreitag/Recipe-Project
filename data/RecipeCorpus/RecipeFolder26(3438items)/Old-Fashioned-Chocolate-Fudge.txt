Categories: Candy, Chocolate
Yield: 1 servings
3 tb Light corn syrup
1/4 ts Salt
3 tb Butter or margarine
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
-Nancy Speicher DPXX20A
1 1/2 c  Milk
4 oz Unsweetened chocolate (sqs)
4 c  Sugar
1. Combine milk and chocolate in medium-size heavy saucepan; cook
over low heat until chocolate is melted. Add sugar, corn syrup and
salt and cook, stirring constantly, to boiling.
2. Cook, without stirring to 234F on a candy thermometer. (A
teaspoonful of syrup will form a soft ball when dropped into cold
water.) Remove from heat at once. Add vanilla and butter or
margarine, but do not stir in.
3. Cool mixture in pan to 110F, or until lukewarm; beat with wooden
spoon until mixture thickens and begins to lose its gloss. (This will
take about 15 minutes.) 4. Spread in a buttered 8x8x2" pan. Let stand
until set and cool; cut into squares.
