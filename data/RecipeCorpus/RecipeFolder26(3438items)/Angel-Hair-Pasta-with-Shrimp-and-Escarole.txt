Shell and devein the shrimp.  Slice each shrimp in half,

not add salt to the cooking water. Meanwhile, heat the chicken broth,
spicy hot vegetable juice, sliced dried tomatoes and 1 1/2 cups of
water in a 3-quart saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil. Add the
shrimp and bring back to a boil. Cook for 1 minute or until the
shrimp turn opaque throughout.  Add the escarole to the shrimp
mixture and cook just until the escarole wilts. Drain the angel-hair

mixture to the pasta and toss well.  Spoon the pasta into a large
bowl.  Sprinkle with the chopped tomato.  Serve immediately. Makes 6
