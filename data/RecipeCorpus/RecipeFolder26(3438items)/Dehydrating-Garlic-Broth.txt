A fantastic warmer upper, any time of year. To a fresh, hot cupful of
vegetable broth, add one clove of garlic, crushed, a dash of soy
sauce, and cayenne or capsicum to taste.  Add a little fresh tomato
juice or tomato chunks.  If you're really hungry, make it in a soup
bowl. Remember the ground flaxseed to thicken, and add a big handful
of sprouts. A real meal. Origin: Dry It - You'll Like It!  circa
