Title: Tomato Ginger Upside-Down Cake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Tomato, Herbs/spice
Yield: 6 servings
1 1/2 c  Brown sugar
1/2 c  Molasses
2 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
2 ts Baking powder
1 tb Ground ginger
1/2 ts Ground cloves
1 c  Buttermilk
1    Stick butter, melted
1 tb Grated fresh ginger
6 tb Light brown sugar
3    Ripe tomatoes, skinned,
Seeded & sliced 1/4 inch
Thick
1    Stick butter
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Combine the melted butter with the ginger and
sugar and spread evenly on the bottom of a 10 x 14 inch baking pan.
Cover with tomato slices.  Meanwhile, in a mixer, cream the butter
with the brown sugar and molasses.  In another bowl, sift together
the flour, baking powder and spices.  Add flour mixture, alternately
with the buttermilk to the creamed butter and sugar.  Pour batter
over tomatoes in baking pan. Bake for approximately 40 minutes, or
until a toothpick comes out clean when testing the center of the
cake. Remove from the oven, loosen outer edges with a knife and
invert onto a platter larger than the baking pan. Let stand at least
5 minutes before trying to remove the pan. Serve warm with whipped
cream or vanilla ice cream.
