directions. Meanwhile heat the oven to 350 degree F.  Grease an
8-inch square baking dish.  In a large bowl combine the eggs, milk,
cream, sugar, grated peels, vanilla, and salt beating until well
blended. Stir the raisins into the rice and spoon the rice mixture
into the prepared baking dish. Pour the egg mixture over the rice and
sprinkle with the cinnamon. Place the baking dish in the oven in a
larger baking pan filled with enough hot water to come halfway up the
sides of the baking dish. Bake for 45 minutes until pudding is almost
set, stirring once after 10 minutes and again 15 minutes later.
Remove the baking dish from the larger pan and cool on a wire rack,
cooling until cold.  Refrigerate, covered, at least 3 hours or
overnight until the pudding is firm.  Serve with whipped cream, if
desired.
