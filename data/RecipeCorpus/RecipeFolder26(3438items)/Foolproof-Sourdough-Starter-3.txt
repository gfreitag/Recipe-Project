Title: Foolproof Sourdough Starter 3
Categories: Bread, Sourdough
Yield: 1 servings
2 1/2 c  White flour, preferably
-unbleached
1 tb Active dry yeast
2 1/2 c  Warm water
Let yeast dissolve in 1/2 cup warm water in a pottery or glass bowl,
then stir in flour and 2 cups warm water; mix well.  Pour into
plastic, glass, or crockery container, cover, and let stand 3-5 days
in a warm place - near but not directly over the stove pilot light is
a good choice.

When the mixture is ready to use, it may be stabilized by being kept
in the refrigerator.  When the liquid rises to the top, mix gently
with a fork to blend before using.

Feed the starter every 5 days by mixing in 1/2 cup flour and 1/3 cup
warm water.

Each time the starter is used, reserve at least 1 cup, replacing the
amount you have taken out with equal amounts of flour and water.
