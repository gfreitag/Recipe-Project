Title: Scandinavian Cardamom Bread
Categories: Breadmaker, Bread
Yield: 2 servings
-finely ground
Dash salt
1 1/4 ts Active dry yeast
--GLAZE:
1    Egg
1 tb Cold water
Pearl sugar for garnish
-Bread Machine Bakery B
1/2 c  Light cream
1    Egg
1/4 c  Unsalted butter
2 1/2 c  Unbleached ALL-PURPOSE
-FLOUR (not bread flour)
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Hulled cardamom seeds,
*note: Granulated sugar can be substituted for the pearl sugar but
they are not the same. Pearl sugar crystals are fairly large, as
their name implies, and they don't dissolve into a glaze as regular
sugar does, but rather remain brillantly white and sparkling on top
of a loaf.

INSTRUCTIONS: Pour the cream into your ABM pan and break the egg
into it. Add the butter, cutting it into chunks first if it is hard,
so it will blend more uniformly into the dough.

Measure in the flour,sugar,cardamom,salt, and following the
instructions given for leavening for your particular machine, the
yeast.

Use the short cycle, and a light loaf setting, if available on your
machine, for best results in baking this bread.

As soon as the loaf is done, pull the pan from the machine and
immediately close the lid to retain heat. Remove the loaf from its
pan.

Beat together the egg and water and paiant the top of the loaf
liberally with this mixture, using a pastry brush. Sprinkle
generously with pearl sugar and gently fit the bread back into its
baking container.Pop the pan back into the ABM for another two
minutes or so. The residual heat of the machine will bak the glaze
on, causing most of the pearl sugar to adhere.

FROM THE RECIPE COLLECTION OF SUZY.Q This bread is delicious!! I used
All-purpose flour as directed. I need about 1/4 C. more flour than the
recipe called for...but it was a rainy day!!

I made another loaf the next day just to use in a Bread Pudding!!
BTW I added golden raisins to both loaves. Mmmmmm!!
