CRUST: In an electric mixer of a mixing bowl, combine the butter,
sugar, egg, and vanilla. Stir in the flour and salt just until
combined; do not overmix. Press the dough into a buttered 10 1/2 x 15
1/2-inch jelly roll pan. Prick the dough gently with a fork and
refrigerate while you prepare the filling. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.
2. FILLING: Toss the apple slices with the lemon juice in a mixing
bowl. In a small bowl, combine the sugar, flour, lemon zest, and
cinnamon. Add to the apples and toss to combine; set aside. 3.
STREUSEL TOPPING: In a mixing bowl or food processor, combine the
flour, sugar, cinnamon, and butter until crumbled to the size of
large peas. 4. Place the apple mixture evenly over the dough. Scatter
the topping over the apples. Bake until lightly golden and the apples
are tender, 25 to 30 mins. Cool on a wire rack; then trim the edges
and cut into 2 x 3-inch bars.
