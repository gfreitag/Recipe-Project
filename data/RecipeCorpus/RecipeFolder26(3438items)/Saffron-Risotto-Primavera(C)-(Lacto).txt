A traditional Italian way to cook rice which results in a creamy side
dish. Best served hot, as this dish doesn't wait. Cook mushrooms,
zucchini, and red pepper until tender crisp in large skillet over
medium-high heat. Remove vegetables; set aside. Cook onions in same
skillet until soft. Add rice and saffron; stir 2 to 3 minutes. Add
wine and stir until absorbed. Stir in broth. Cook, uncovered,
stirring frequently, until broth is absorbed.  Continue stirring and
add 2 cups water, allowing the first cup to be absorbed before adding
the second. Cook until rice is tender and mixture has a creamy
consistency. It will take approximately 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in
cheese, parsley, white pepper, and reserved vegetables. Serve
immediately. Nutrition (per serving): 135 calories Total Fat 1 g (9%
