30    Whole shelled hazelnuts
1 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
-siftef for dusting
1 1/2 lb Unsweetened chocolate
2    Egg yolks
1 c  Confectioner's sugar
1/2 c  Heavy or whipping cream
4 tb Unsalted butter
Preheat oven to 375 F
Place 10 oz of the chocolate in a heavy saucepan, and melt over low
heat. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.
Combine the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the confectioner's sugar in a
large bowl, and cream until well blended.
Combine the cream, butter, and remaining 1/2 c sugar in a
medium-sized saucpan and bring to a boil, stirring until the butter
and sugar are thoroughly melted.
Slowly pour the hot sugar mixutre over the egg yolk mixutre,
whisking constantly. Mix thoroughly and set aside to cool slightly,
then stir in the melted chocolate and the Scotch; beat for one minute.
Place the mixutre in the refrigerator and chill until firm, 30-45
minutes.
Meanwhile, place the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast them in
the oven for 15 minutes. Remove them from the oven and rub handfuls
of nuts in a kitchen towel to remove their skins. Set them aside.
Roll a spoonful of the chilled chocolate around each hazelnut to
rorm a truffle about 1 inch in diameter. Set themn on a baking sheet
lined with waxed paper, and chill thoroughly in the refrigerator 2-3
hours.
Mlet the remaining 14 oz chocolate in a heavy saucepan over low heat.
Remove the pan from the heat.
Sprinkle a shallow dish generously with cocoa. Dip each truffle in
the melted chocolate, covering it completely, then lift it out with a
fork and roll it in the cocoa. Arrange the truffles on a baking sheet
again, and chill before serving.
