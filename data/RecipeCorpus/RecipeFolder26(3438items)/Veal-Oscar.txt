Bernaise sauce
Fresh tarragon sprigs
(optional)
1/4 t  Salt
1/4 t  Ground pepper

Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the veal.  Place the veal and the
flour in a large zip-top plastic bag.  Seal the bag and shake to coat
the veal with flour.

Melt 1 tablespoon of the margarine in a large nonstick skillet over
medium heat. Add half of the veal and cook for 1 minute on each side,
until browned.  Remove the veal from the skillet, set it aside and
keep it warm. Repeat with the remaining margarine and veal.  Wipe the
drippings from the skillet with paper towels.

Coat the skillet with vegetable cooking spray and place over medium
heat. Add the crabmeat and saute for 1 minute or until warm.  Squeeze
the juice from the lemon halves over the crabmeat and stir well.
Remove from the heat and set aside.

Place 3 slices of veal and one quarter of the steamed asparagus on
each of 4 serving plates. Spoon the crabmeat evenly over the veal and
top each serving with 3 tablespoons of Bernaise Sauce 2.  If desired,
garnish with fresh tarragon sprigs.

Makes 4 servings.
