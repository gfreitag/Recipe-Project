Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. With a pastry brush, butter the bottom and
sides of an 8 x 3 inch springform cake pan with a Tbs of butter. With
a whisk or a rotary or electric beater, beat the egg yolks for about
1 min, then slowly pour in the sugar. Continue beating until the
mixture falls back on itself in a ribbon when the beater is lifted
out of the bowl. Beat in the grated lemon rind and lemon juice, and
with a rubber spatula, fold in the hazel nuts. In an another bowl,
and with a clean beater, beat the egg whites until they form firm,
unwavering peaks on the beater when it is lifted out of the bowl.
Gently but thoroughly fold the whites into the egg-yolk mixture until
no streaks of white show. Pour the batter into the buttered pan and
spread evenly to the sides with the spatula. Bake in the center of
the oven for about 40 mins, or until it has puffed and has begun to
come slightly away from the sides of the pan. Turn off heat and let
cake rest in the oven for 15 mins. Remove the sides of the pan and
turn cake out on a cake rack. Cool to room temperature.

TOPPING:

To make the topping, beat the cream with a whisk or a rotary or
electric beater until it forms soft peaks. Then gradually beat in the
rum and sugar and continue to beat until stiff. With a spatula,
spread over the top of the cake and serve at once.
