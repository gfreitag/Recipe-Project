Title: Wine Jelly Sans Gelatin
Categories: Fatfree, Dessert, Alcohol
Yield: 1 servings
1    3 ounce pouch liquid
Pectin
1 3/4 c  Wine
3 c  Sugar (Vegans, try
Succanat )
Prepare 4 half-pint canning jars or jelly glasses. (Wash, and leave
in hot water.  Wash lids if necessary, and place in boiling water.
Leave in hot water until ready.)

Mix wind and sugar in top of a double boiler.  Place over boiling
water; stir

until sugar is completely dissolved (circa 5 minutes). Remove from
heat, but leave mix over hot water.  Stir in pactin all at once. If
foam forms, skim off with a metal spoon.

Leave the jelly to set one minutes, skim off the foam. Pour jelly
quickly into hot jars, filling to 1/8" of the top. Carefully wipe off
rim of jar. Put lid on each jar as it is filled, screwing ring
tightly.

[At this point, Sunset says to let cool.  I'd process in a water bath
for 5 minutes.  In a bath (a stockpot or huge saucepan), set up a
small rack and fill with enough water to cover the filled jars, with
about an inch of water.  Hint:  if you boil your jars to sterilize
them, use the water bath for both purposes. Hint2: Pressure cookers
make good water baths for small runs. ]

[Still on water bath:  Put jars into boiling water, and start timer
when water gets batck to boiling. Hold for 5 minutes, then pull out.]

(if you stay with the Sunset approach, invert the jars to finish
sterilizing the lids.  You'll avoid any mold.)

Place jars on a towel *away from drafts* and let cool. Should keep
almost forever until opened.

[Note:  Jelly recipes leave little room for variation. Do not double,
and don't play with the proportions of sugar/wine. Lastly, find the
right pectin.  It matters. I have several pints of cranapple syrup
that were supposed to be jelly to remind me of these facts...
