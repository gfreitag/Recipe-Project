NOTES : Poland's national dish, a very old one, is called bigos. It is
prepared with a large number of ingredients and is a marvelous
party dish. Originally the stew was made with cabbage, onions,
mushrooms and a variety of other vegetables, as well as with
apples, prunes and an abundance of game and meats. The hearty
:
:
:
:
dish
supposedly evolved because it was a good way to use the ample
supplies of game left over from lengthy banquets. Bigos
:
:
became the
staple food for hunters, particularly because it could be
:
reheated
and tastes even better that way. Served at many important
:
Polish
festivities, bigos is made today in several versions, but its
basic characteristic is the same - a rich combination of
:
:
hearty
foods. Some of the stews are made in great quantity and take
:
days
to prepare. This is a simple but good variation.
