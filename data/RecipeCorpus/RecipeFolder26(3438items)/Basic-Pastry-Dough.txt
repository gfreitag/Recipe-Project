Recipe by: From The Farmers' Market - ISBN 0-06-055005-8 1. By Hand:
Sift the flour, salt, and sugar into a large mixing bowl. Cut the
butter and shortening into small pieces, letting them fall into the
dry ingredients. Using your fingertips, a pastry blender, or two
knives, cut the mixture together until it is crumbly; do not over
mix. 2. Sprinkle the cold water over the flour mixture, tossing with
a fork. Add just enough water so that the dough coheres in a ball; do
not make the pastry too wet. Gently flatten the pastry ball into a
patty shape. Dust with flour; wrap in plastic wrap, and chill at
least 1 hour before rolling out. 3. With a Food Processor: Place the
flour, salt, and sugar in the processor bowl and mix with several
on/off pulses. Add the butter and shortening, in large pieces, to the
bowl. Pulse on and off until the mixture is crumbly; do not
overprocess. Add the water gradually, pulsing the machine, until the
dough begins to clump together, but doesn't yet form a ball; add a
little more water if needed to hold the dough together. (Check the
texture after a few pulses so you avoid adding too much water.)
Transfer the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap and press gently into a
ball. Flatten the dough to a disk shape, flour lightly, wrap, and
chill at least 1 hour.

NOTES : This pastry freezes well; make several batches and freeze in
small
portions.
