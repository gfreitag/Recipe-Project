From northern Mexico (Monterrey/Nuevo Leon)

Sun-dried meat is typical of Monterrey and of the entire state of
Nuevo Leon, having originated in the town of Sienega.  Once dried,
the meat is rolled and sold as is.

For the beef:

vegetable oil
1 cup
2 1/2 cups white onion, finely chopped
2 1/2 cups dried beef, finely shredded
2 1/2 cups tomato, finely chopped
each chiles serranos OR piquines
OR cambrayes, finely chopped

16    each eggs, beaten
3/4   tsp  salt

For the garnish:

lb   pinto beans, cooked, refried
with chopped onion, and
thickened (recipe separately

Frijoles Maneados)
cup  fresh cheese, such as feta
OR dried ricotta, crumbled

12    each sprigs cilantro

Heat 3/4 cup oil in a saucepan.  Add onion, and saute until lightly
browned.  Add beef, tomato, and chiles.  Continue cooking over low
heat until sauce thickens.  (The sauce can be made ahead to this
point.)

Add 1/4 cup oil.  Reheat sauce, and return to boil.  Add eggs and
salt. Cook over high heat, occasionally stirring with a fork, until
the eggs are spongy - do not allow them to dry. To serve, spoon a
layer of hot beans onto the center of a platter.  Ring the beans with
the shredded beef and egg mixture.

Sprinkle with cheese.  Decorate with cilantro.  Serve with freshly
made tortillas and coffee. Makes 8 servings.
