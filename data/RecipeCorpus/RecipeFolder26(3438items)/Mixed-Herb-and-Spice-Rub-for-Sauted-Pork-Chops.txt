Categories: Herbs/spice, Mixes, Pork
Yield: 1 servings
1    Whole clove OR
1    Allspice berry
2    Juniper berries (opt)
3/4 ts Salt
1/4 ts Dried leaf thyme
1/4 ts Dried rosemary
1/4 ts Black or white peppercorns

Grind spice to a fine powder in a coffee or spice grinder. Mix in the

Before cooking, scrape off marinade and dry chops again. Do not add
salt or pepper.

pork chops.
