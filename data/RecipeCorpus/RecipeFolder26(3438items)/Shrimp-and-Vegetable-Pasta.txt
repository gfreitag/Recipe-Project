* The recipe originally called for a full cup of olive oil.
** Available at Asian markets and some specialty food shops.

1. At least 2 hours ahead, bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Carefully drop in the shrimp and cook just until tender, about 1
minute. Drain, rinse under cold running water and drain again.  Set
aside in a large serving bowl.

2. Add the bell peppers, tomaotes, dill, tarragon, shallots, red
pepper flakes, black pepper, salt, lemon juice, olive oil and chile
oil to the bowl of shrimp. Cover and refrigerate.

3. When ready to serve, bring a large saucepan of water to a boil.
Drop in the broccoli and cook for 1 minute. Drain, rinse under cold
running water and drain again. Toss the broccoli and the peas with
the shrimp and vegetable mixture; set aside.

4. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add 1 tablespoon of
additional olive oil and the linguine.  Cook, at a rolling boil,
until just tender. Drain the linguine and immediately toss with the
shrimp and vegetables. Serve at once. Makes 6 servings.

NOTE: "This festive pasta sauce combines blanching and marinating for
the flavors to emerge ++ but it's a very simple sauce. Don't be
embarrassed when the raves roll in.  Just accept them graciously and
save your secret."
