1/2 tb Butter
Black pepper
50 g  Chopped green onions
200 ml Port wine
By rights, this dish requires lengthy preparation of a stock made
with the bones and trimmings of venison. However, this is impossible
for most of us who buy venison as a boneless fillet.

A good beef stock is a satisfactory substitute and if you use a
canned beef bouillon (Campbells makes one) and prepare the chestnuts
in advance, the meal can be prepared very rapidly.

Melt half a tablespoon of butter in a heavy saucepan, add a good
grinding of black pepper and gently cook 50 g chopped green (spring)
onions. Add 200 mL port and reduce. Add 300 mL stock and 24 peeled
chestnuts and simmer for about 20 minutes or until the sauce becomes
syrupy. Set aside and keep warm.

Heat a heat a heavy-based frying pan, add a tablespoon of butter.
When it is very hot, cook 8 medallions of venison, each about 1 cm
thick.

Sear them for a maximum of 1 minute on each side, to ensure they are
still rare.

Meanwhile, butter a baking tray and slice onto it 4 figs. Place under
a grill to heat through.

Divide the sauce and chestnuts between four heated plates and add to
each plate 2 medallions of venison and a fan of fig slices. Serve
immediately.
