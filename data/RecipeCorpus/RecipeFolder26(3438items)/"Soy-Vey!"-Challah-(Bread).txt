large loaf This recipe won first place in a special competition at
the Ohio State Fair this year: Cooking with Ohio's Soy Foods,
sponsored by the Ohio Soybean Council. It also received an "award of
Excellence" rosette.

You can also use this recipe in a bread machine, either by going
through the whole cycle, or by using the dough setting and shaping
the dough into a large braid, which is what I usually do.. If you're
not wild about soy, you can change the soy milk to water, and the soy
oil to another kind of oil.
