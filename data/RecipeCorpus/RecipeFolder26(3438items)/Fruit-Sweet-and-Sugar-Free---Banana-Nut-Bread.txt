Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Banana Nut Bread
Categories: Bread, Fruit, Nuts/grains, Diabetic
Yield: 2 loaves
1/4 c  Walnuts
MMMMM----------------------DRY INGREDIENTS---------------------------
1 t  Cinnamon
1/4 t  Salt
2 c  Unbleached white flour
2 t  Baking soda
1/2 t  Baking powder
MMMMM----------------------WET INGREDIENTS---------------------------
3/4 c  Mashed bananas
(2 medium size)
3    Eggs
1/2 c  Oil
3/4 c  Fruit sweetener
2 1/4 t  Vanilla extract
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray two bread pans with
lecithin spray. Toast the walnuts in the oven for 7-10 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool. Then coarsely chop
them with a knife or with a pulsing action in a food processor. Put
them aside. Sift the dry ingredients together. Use an electric mixer
on medium speed to whisk the oil and the sweetener together until
thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well
after each addition. Reduce the speed and stir in the vanilla and the
mashed bananas. On low speed, slowly add the sifted dry ingredients
and the toasted walnuts. Mix just until blended, being careful not to
overmix. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pans. Bake the loaves
on the middle shelf of the preheated oven for 45-60 minutes until a
toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool
the loaves slightly before removing them from the pans and cooling
them on a wire rack. When cool, wrap the breads in plastic wrap and
let them sit overnight at rom temperature before slicing (if you can
wait). Submitted By JANE KNOX   On   10-01-94
