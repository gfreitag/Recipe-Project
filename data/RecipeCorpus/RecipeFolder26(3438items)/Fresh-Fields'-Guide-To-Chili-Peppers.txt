Habanero -  HHHOTTT!!!  Would you believe 50 times hotter than a
jalapeno?

Scotch Bonnet -  Almost as hot as a habanero, this pepper is used in
Caribbean cooking.  It has a tropical, fruity flavor.

Jalapeno -  Our most popular pepper.  Look for jalapenos that are deep
green.

Anaheim -  These long, green chilies are relatively mild (for a chili
pepper, that is).  They are the variety most often used in packaged
and prepared foods.

Dried Peppers:

Dried Ancho Chilies -  These are the sweetest of the chilies and are
ideal for sauces and moles.

Dried Habanero Chilies -  These are just as hot dried as fresh!

Dried Chipotle Chilies - Also called Ahumado, these are smoked dried
jalapeno chilies that are excellent in seasoning soup and salsa.

Dried Japones Chilies -  These are small, very hot peppers grown in
China and Japan.  Use them in your favorite stir fry.

Dried Pastilla Chilies -  These mild to medium hot chilies have a rich
flavor that is excellent when ground and used in sauces.
