Title: Classic Sourdough Bread
Categories: Bread, Sourdough
Yield: 1 servings
1 tb Salt
1 tb Sugar
1 ts Baking soda
-Cornmeal to sprinkle on
-pans
1 c  Sourdough starter
1 1/3 c  Warm water
5    To 6 c all-purpose flour or
-a combination of
-all-purpose and whole
-wheat flours
THE SPONGE:

Pour 1 c of starter into a large ceramic mixing bowl.
Feed and then refrigerate the remainder. Add to the starter in the
mixing bowl, the warm water and about 3 c of flour. Beat vigorously
with a spoon or wire whisk. Cover this sponge with plastic wrap and
put it aside to work. This time period can be very flexible, but
allow at least 2 hours and as many as 24. The longer it has, the more
yeast there will be for the second rise and the more pronounced the
sour flavor of the bread will be.

THE DOUGH:

After sponge has bubbled and expanded, remove plastic wrap. Blend
salt, sugar and baking soda into 2 c of flour. Mix this into sponge
with large spoon. When dough begins to hold together, turn it out
onto floured board and knead it for 3 or 4 minutes. Add flour as
needed to make a fairly stiff dough.Give the dough a rest and clean
the bowl. Continue kneading for another 3 or 4 minutes. Place the
dough back in the bowl turning it to grease the top. Cover and let
rise for 2 to 4 hours.If you want, you can skip the second rise in
the bowl and proceed directly to the next step.

SHAPING AND BAKING THE LOAVES:

Knock down the dough and shape it into 2 long loaves.
Place them on a cornmeal sprinkled cookie sheet, cover and let them
rise for another 2 hours or so.Toward the end of the rising period,
preheat your oven to 450F and begin heating a kettle of water on your
stove.
Just before you put them in the oven, slash the tops of your loaves
diagonally with a knife 1/4" deep every two inches and brush with cold
water.Place a baking pan on the oven bottom and put in 3 or 4 cups of
boiling water. Put the loaves on the rack over the steaming water,
close the oven and bake for about 25 minutes.
