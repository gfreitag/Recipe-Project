More(Y/n/=)? bakery, in order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock.
Select "white bread" and push Start.

If Caesar made bread instead of salad dressing, this would be it.
Sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes or tuna salad, or serve it with a
green salad. For an hors d'oeuvre, toast slices and top with steak
tartare or a sliver of rare roast beef. The crusty ends can be cut
into croutons, toasted in a frying pan, and tossed in a salad.
