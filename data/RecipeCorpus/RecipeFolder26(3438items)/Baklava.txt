Arrange 1/3 of the pastry sheets, each sheet brushed with melted
butter, in a baking dish that is a suitable size for pastry sheets.
Combine nuts, 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle 1/2 mixture over
phyllo sheets. Place anothe third of the pastry sheets, each sheet
brushed with melted butter, over the nut mixture. Repeat with another
layer of nut mixture and the remaining 1/3 of the pastry sheets. With
a sharp knife, cut into diamond-shaped pieces. Bake in a preheated
moderate oven (350Â°F.) for 1 hour, or until cooked. Remove from oven
and cool a little. Meanwhile, combine remaining 1 1/2 cups of sugar,
water and lemon juice in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Lower heat;
simmer until mixture thickens. Pour, while still warm, over the
baklava; leave at room temperature until ready to serve. Makes about
20 pieces.

NOTES : This internationally known dessert is well-liked in
Yugoslavia,
where the recipes vary from one household to another. Although
the
paperthin pastry can be made at home, the process is very
difficult; usually, the pastry is purchased. In America it can
be
bought at specialty food stores or Greek and Middle Eastern
groceries.
