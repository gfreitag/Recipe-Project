Title: David's Mushroom Barley Soup
Categories: Fatfree, Soup/stew, Mushroom, Nuts/grains
Yield: 1 servings
1/2 t  Salt
1/4 t  Fresh ground black pepper
1 t  Dill weed
1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
2 c  Vegetable broth
8 c  Water
2    Carrots, diced
2    Onions, chopped
2    Stalks celery, chopped
4    Cloves garlic (or more!),
Chopped or crushed
1 1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms (sliced or
Whole)
1/2 c  Soy sauce or tamari
1 3/4 c  Barley
In a large pot combine chopped onion, celery, garlic and mushrooms.
Saute for about 4 minutes in just enough vegetable stock to keep them
from sticking. Add the barley, soy sauce, seasonings, the rest of the
vegetable broth and water. Bring to a boil, and then simmer for 2 to
3 hours. 45 minutes before it's done, add the chopped carrots. If it
gets too thick, add additional water. Try to keep people from opening
the lid :)
