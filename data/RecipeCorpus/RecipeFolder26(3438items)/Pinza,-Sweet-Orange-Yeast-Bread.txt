MMMMM----------------AN EGG WASH MADE BY BEATING---------------------
1 t  Cold water
1 lg Egg yolk with
In a small bowl sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup lukewarm water, stir
in 3/4 cup of the flour and 1 tablespoon of the sugar, and let the
mixture stand, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 30
minutes, or until the sponge is double in bulk. In a bowl whisk
together 2 cups of the remaining flour and 1/3 cup of the remaining
sugar and in another bowl whisk together half the butter, half the
milk, heated to lukewarm, the whole eggs, 3 of the yolks, the salt,
and the zest . Transfer the sponge to the bowl of an electric mixer
fitted with either the dough hook or the paddle attachment and beat
in the flour mixture alternately with the butter mixture, beginning
and ending with the flour mixture and beating the dough after each
addition until it is combined well. Beat the mixture for 1 minute
more, or until it forms a sticky dough, scrape down the dough from
the side of the bowl, and let it rise, covered, in a warm place for 1
1/2 hours, or until it is double in bulk. (Alternatively, let the
dough rise, covered and chilled, overnight.) In a bowl whisk together
2 cups of the remaining flour and the remaining sugar and in another
bowl whisk together the remaining butter, the remaining milk, heated
to lukewarm, and the remaining 2 yolks. With the electric mixer
fitted with either the dough hook or the paddle attachment beat the
flour mixture into the risen dough alternately with the butter
mixture, beating until the dough is combined well. Let the dough
rise, covered, for 1 1/2 hours, or until it is double in bulk.
(Alternatively, let the dough rise, covered and chilled, overnight.)
Divide the dough into 3 or 4 pieces and in the bowl of a food
processor process the dough with enough of the remaining 1 1/4 cups
flour to form a soft, slightly sticky dough. Process the dough for 1
minute more, transfer it to a lightly floured surface, and knead it,
adding more of the flour as necessary if the dough becomes too sticky
to handle, for 5 to 7 minutes, or until it is very smooth and
elastic. Divide the dough in half, form each half into a ball, and on
a buttered baking sheet let the loaves rise, covered, for 1 hour, or
until they are double in bulk. Brush each loaf with some of the egg
wash and with a sharp knife make 3 curved 1/2-inch-deep slashes in
the top of each loaf, starting each cut from the center of the loaf
and forming a Y pattern. Bake the loaves in the middle of a preheated
350 F. oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until they are golden and sound
hollow when tapped. (If the loaves begin to brown too early, put
sheets of foil over them, dull sides down, about halfway through the
baking time.) Let the loaves cool on a rack and serve them at room
temperature.
