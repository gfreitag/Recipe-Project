Title: Chile-Garlic Scallops
Categories: Clam/oyster
Yield: 4 servings
-cored, seeded and minced
-or to taste
1/4 ts Turmeric
3 tb Water
1/4 c  Cilantro; minced
Salt
2 tb Butter or
-1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil
1 lb To 1 1/2 lb scallops
-large pieces halved
1/2 tb Garlic; minced
-or to taste
1/2 ts Jalape¤o pepper
Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
scallops and cook until they begin to brown in places, 1 to 2
minutes. Remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving any
liquid in the skillet. The scallops should not be crowded in the
skillet or they will not brown; if necessary, brown them in two
batches.

Lower the heat to medium, add the garlic and cook until golden. Stir
in the jalape¤o and turmeric. Add the water and bring to a boil. Add
the scallops, reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the scallops
are just opaque through (cut one to test), 3 to 5 minutes.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer the scallops to a warmed serving
platter or bowl and cover to keep warm. Bring the cooking liquid to a
boil and cook until it thickens slightly, 2 to 4 minutes, stirring
often. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro and salt to taste. Pour
sauce over scallops and serve.
