Title: Almost Perfect Cheesecake
Categories: Cake/cookie, Cheese/eggs
Yield: 1 servings
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
1 ea Stick butter
1 ea Box vanilla wafers
MMMMM-------------------------DIRECTIONS------------------------------
Crush  wafers in food processor or blender until finely ground. Melt
butter and mix with wafers for crust.  Press into a 10 inch
springform pan with your fingers, take care to make the crust as thin
as possible with special attention to the corners where the crust
tends to be a bit thick. Filling: Ingredients: 3 large pkg. cream
3 grade A
cheese 3/4 cup sugar juice of one large lemon
large eggs Directions: Blend thoroughly the cream cheese, sugar and
lemon juice.  Mix until smooth . Add eggs and blend well.  Pour
mixture into crust and bake for 30 to 45 minutes at 350 degrees.
When done the cake will be set (not solid), slightly golden, and
perhaps split on top.  It is better slightly over and not under done.
Remove from the oven and cool on a rack. It will firm up more on
cooling. This is an important step...cool for about 45 minutes.
Topping: Ingredients: 3 cups sour cream 3/4 cup sugar 2 tsp vanilla
Directions: Mix sour cream, 3/4 cup sugar and vanilla.  Pour on top
of cooled cake. Return to 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  Cool to
room temperature. Refrigerate and cool thoroughly (overnight is fine)
but at least 5-6 hours). Freezes well.  You may serve now if you do
not care for a glaze or for a killer bodiller glaze.... Glaze:
Ingredients: 1 can (1 lb) sour pitted cherries (packed in water) 1/2
cup sugar 1 tbs cornstarch 1 tbs lemon juice 2 drops red food
coloring Directions: Drain cherries, reserving 1/2 cup liquid. Put
aside cherries.  In a saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch. Add cherry
liquid, stir until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil
1 minute..until thick and clear. Remove from heat, let cool slightly.
Add lemon juice, cherries, food coloring. Cool until still warm but
pourable. Pour on top on chilled cheese cake. Refrigerate for an hour
or so.....While the cake may be prepared a day before, do not glaze
until the day that you plan to serve. I have also used commercially
prepared pie fillings  as a glaze with good results.
