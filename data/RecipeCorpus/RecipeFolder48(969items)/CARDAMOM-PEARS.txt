Title: CARDAMOM PEARS
Categories: Desserts, Medieval, Fruit
Yield: 4 Servings
2    Pears,halved,peeled, & cored
1 1/4 c  Water
1/4 c  Red wine
1/4 c  Sugar
5    Whole cardamom pods
3    Whole cloves
MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
2 c  Fresh rasberries or
-strawberries
1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
1/4 ts Mace
Fresh rose petals,if desired
-(not commercial roses; they
-are sprayed with pesticides
**Sprinkle prepared pears with lemon juice to prevent discoloration.**

Combine water, wine, sugar, cardamom (pop seed sout of the pods), and
cloves in a sauce pan.  Bring to a boil, then add pear ahlves and
simmer about 10 minutes.  Turn once or twice, then remove form heat
and cool; make sauce.

To Make Sauce: Combine berries, cinnnamon and mace; mash these very
well (or use food proccessor). Press through sieve to strain out
seeds. Spoon out some onto a dessert plate, enough to cover most, but
not all, of the bottom.  Drain the pears from their cooking liquid
(which you may reserve, strain and add to fruit juice and put over
ice for a cool drink) and place them cut side down in the puddle of
the berry sauce. Sprinkle with rose petals for effect.

(Kim's Note: I've served it with a fresh mint leaf garnish, tiny bits
of black-caps as garnish, and many other garnishes as well...but the
rose petals, if you can get them [remember, no pesticides!], is
georgeous!)
