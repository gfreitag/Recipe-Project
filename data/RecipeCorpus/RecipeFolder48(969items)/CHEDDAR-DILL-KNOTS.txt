Generously grease cookie sheets.  In large bowl, combine flour

With greased or floured hands, shape dough into a ball. Knead dough 5
minutes until smooth, sprinkling with additional flour if necessary
to reduce stickiness. Cover dough with large bowl; let rest 5

roll each piece into 8" rope; tie into loose knot. Place 2 to 3"
apart on greased cookie sheets. Cover loosely with greased plastic
wrap and cloth towel.  Let rise in warm place for 25 minutes or until
almost doubled in size.  Heat oven to 375 degrees. Uncover dough. In
small bowl, beat all topping ingredients; lightly brush over rolls.
Bake for 13 to 18 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve warm or cool.
