Title: CARMELIZED OREGON HAZELNUTS
Categories: Candy, Nuts
Yield: 10 Hazelnuts
10    Oregon hazelnuts
Toast hazelnuts and rub off skins or leave skins on.

Skewer each nut on a wooden or metal skewer. In a small saucepan over
medium heat, dissolve 1/2 cup sugar in 1/2 cup water. Cover and bring
to a boil, cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Uncover, but do not stir. Wash
sugar crystals from the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush.
Continue to cook without stirring until syrup is a medium dark amber
color. Remove from heat and quickly dip each skewered nut in the
syrup. Prop skewer so the nuts can drip and harden. Snip off any
caramel tails that may have formed. Store in airtight container. Can
be used as a garnish for cakes and desserts.
