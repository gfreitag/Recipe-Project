Categories: Pies
Yield: 8 Servings
2 c  Cooked carrots, mashed
1 c  Sugar

Unbaked deep 9" pie shell
Pumpkins don't grow well in most parts of Alaska, but carrots do!

Mix all ingredients together until very well blended. Pour into an
unbaked deep dish or 2 smaller pie shells. Bake at 425 F for 40 to 50
minutes or until a knife inserted one inch from the edge comes out
clean. Center will look soft but filling will set as it cools.
