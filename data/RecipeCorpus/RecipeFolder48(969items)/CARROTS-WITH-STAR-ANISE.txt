I make this with organic carrots, their natural sweetness is
unequalled by the other kind! Peel and trim the carrots and cut them
across into slices about quarter of an inch thick. Put them in a
solid pan, wide enough to hold them in two or three layers. Add the
aniseed, which you can leave in the star shaped shell, the sugar,
salt and butter and enough water just to cover everything. Cook them
over a fierce heat, turning a couple of times, until the water boils
away and the carrots just start to sizzle. At that moment the carrots
will be done. It takes about 12 minutes, depending on the thickness
and size of the pan. The carrots absorb the exotic flavour of the
star anise and the butter and sugar coats them with a glaze.
