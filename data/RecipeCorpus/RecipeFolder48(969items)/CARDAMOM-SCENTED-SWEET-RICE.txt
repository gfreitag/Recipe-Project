Categories: Desserts
Yield: 8 Servings
3 c  Low-fat milk or rice milk
1 c  Water
1 ts Minced ginger
25    Cardamom pods
3    4-inch cinnamon sticks
1 c  Basmati or jasmine rice
1/4 c  Honey
1/3 c  Pitted dates, chopped
1 ts Vanilla
8    Sprigs mint (optional)
Combine 1 cup milk, water, ginger, cardamom and cinnamon sticks in a
medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then add rice and honey and stir
well. Bring mixture to a boil once more, then reduce heat to low and
simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed (about 20
minutes).

Stir in remaining milk, dates, honey and vanilla.  Let cook for 10
minutes, stirring frequently.  When pudding has thickened slightly,
transfer to serving dishes and chill. To serve, garnish with fresh
mint.
