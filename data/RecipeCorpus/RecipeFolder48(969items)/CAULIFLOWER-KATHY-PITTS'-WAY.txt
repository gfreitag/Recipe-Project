Title: CAULIFLOWER KATHY PITTS' WAY
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 1 Recipe
1    Head cauliflower
4 oz Butter
1/2 c  Dry bread crumbs
1    Lemon, juice only
Remove the leaves from the cauliflower and remove most of the core
(leaving enough core to keep the cauliflower in one piece.) Steam
till just tender.

Meanwhile, melt about half a stick of butter in a small frying pan.
Toss in the bread crumbs, and cook till the crumbs are brown,
stirring all the while. Add the juice of a lemon.

Place the steamed cauliflower in a serving bowl and pour the
lemon/butter /crumb mixture over it. Serve.
