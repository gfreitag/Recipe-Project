This is an absolutely no-fuss way to prepare artichokes, yet produces
a delicious result.  The original Italian recipe on which this is
based uses three times the amount of oil specified below, but the
lower-fat version works fine.

Have ready a basin of acidulated water.  Take 4 large artichokes or 8
small ones and prepare them as described above, cutting them into
quarters and dropping them into the basin as they are done. Pack the
artichoke quarters in a single layer into a open pan. Pour over them
enough boiling water to barely cover the artichokes, add 2
tablespoons of olive oil and some roughly crushed peppercorns.  Boil
hard until the water has evaporated, then add the juice of a lemon
and stir.

Put the artichokes into a serving dish and scatter with chopped
parsley. They can be served hot or cold.
