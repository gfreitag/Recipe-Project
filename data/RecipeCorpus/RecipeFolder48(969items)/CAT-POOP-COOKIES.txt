"puffy pastel things"; *
-find at Chinese restaurants
*NOTE: "puffy pastel things are to look like the cat ate styrofoam
packing pellets-i haven't tried this TO MAKE: icrowave the honey till
it bubbles(about 1 minute). add the butter,(i've been told using lard
makes for a more realistic texture and softer cookie) and the
molasses, if any. add the egg, mix well, then mix in all the other
stuff. add mix-ins of your choice to some or all of the batter. Chill
1 hour in the freezer or several hours in the fridge. roll dough logs
of random length and the diameter of cat poops. roll logs in grape-
nuts and bake at 350 degrees till done(maybe 10 to 15 minutes but
with my flaky oven you never know). Serve in a disposable cat litter
box on a bed of grapenuts, with a cat litter scoop. i hear you get
lovely effects by decorating the box and scoop with melted chocolate
or pudding.  i imagine brown sugar might work as a substitute for the
new clumping litters, but i havent tried it. this recipe worked
especially well at the halloween party where the table was already
decorated with plastic flies.
