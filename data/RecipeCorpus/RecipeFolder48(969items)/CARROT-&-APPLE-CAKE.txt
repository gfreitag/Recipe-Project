Soul food from the deep south of the US, this is the carrot cake
you've been waiting for - moist, luscious and just about foolproof to
make.

Grate (in a food processor for speed) 1 cup of apples and 1 cup of
carrots. Tip into a mixing bowl and add 2 cups plain flour, 2 cups
sugar, 3 eggs, 1 cup chopped pecan nuts, 1 cup oil, 2 teaspoons
vanilla essence, 2 teaspoons baking soda. 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1
teaspoon salt. Mix very thoroughly with beaters for up to 5 minutes.
Pour the mixture into a greased cake tin and bake at 180 C for 45
minutes or until the cake comes away from the sides of the pan and a
skew inserted in the middle comes out clean.
