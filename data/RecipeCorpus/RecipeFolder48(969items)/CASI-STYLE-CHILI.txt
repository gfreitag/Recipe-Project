Title: CASI-STYLE CHILI
Categories: Stews, Beef, Texan
Yield: 6 Servings
4    Jalape#o chiles
-stems & deveined, halved
4 tb Chili powder
1 tb Paprika
2 lb Beef chuck
1 md Onion, chopped
2 tb Kidney suet; chopped
-substitute vegetable oil
8 oz Tomato sauce
12 oz Beer
2 c  Beef stock
3 ts Cumin, ground
2 ts Garlic powder
1 ts Pepper, black
1/4 c  Masa harina (finely ground
-maize flour)
Cut beef into 1-1/2" cubes.  Brown the meat and onions in oil or fat.

Add the tomato sauce, beer, beef stock, chiles, cumin, garlic, black
pepper, and 2 tablespoons of the Chili Powder. Simmer the chili over
a low head for 2 hours until the meat is tender.

To thicken, make a thin paste of the masa and water. Quickly stir
this into the chili -- if done too slowly it will lump.

Add the remaining Chili Powder and Paprika.  Simmer for an additional
15 minutes.  Remove the Jalapenos and serve.

[CASI (Chili Appreciation Society International) chili-cookoff
winners tend to use blended chili powder and also Jalape#o chiles,
which are usually removed before serving. The beef is cubed, and
masa, which is flour made from ground dried maize available in Latin
markets, is used to thicken the chili.]
