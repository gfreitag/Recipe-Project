Categories: Appetizer, Grains
Yield: 6 Servings
24    Garlic cloves (unpeeled)
1 tb Olive oil
4 tb Unsalted butter
-OR- olive/vegetable oil
1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
1/2 c  Dry white wine
5 c  Vegetable stock
1/2 c  Chopped fresh chives

Preheat oven to 350 F.

In a medium saucepan, heat 3 or 4 cups of water until boiling. Add
garlic and let cook 30 seconds.  Drain off water. Bring a fresh batch
of water to a boil and blanch garlic a second time. Drain. Transfer
garlic to a shallow baking pan and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil.
Toss to coat cloves evenly with oil.  Bake until lightly browned,
about 25 minutes. Cool. Peel and chop garlic; set aside.

In a medium saucepan, saute onion in butter (or oil) about 5 minutes
on medium-low heat.  Add rice.  Cook and stir 1 minutes, then add
white wine. Simmer until liquid is almost completely absorbed. Add
vegetable stock and continue to simmer, stirring often, about 30
minutes, until rice is tender. Stir in garlic and chives and season
with salt and pepper to taste.
