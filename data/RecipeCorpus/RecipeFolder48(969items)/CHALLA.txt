Categories: Breads, Jewish
Yield: 2 Servings
2 1/2 c  Water, tepid (about 110 f)
3 ts Salt
3 tb Sugar
3    Quick-rising dry yeast,
- envelopes
3    Eggs, beaten - at room temp
1/2 c  Vegetable oil
3 lb Unbleached white flour
Cornmeal, for baking
MMMMM--------------------------EGG WASH-------------------------------
2    Egg yolks
1 tb Water
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
1 tb Sesame seeds
Place the water, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a heavy-duty
electric mixer (KitchenAid K5A2 model works best). Stir to dissolve
the sugar. Add the yeast and stir to dissolve. Stir in the beaten
eggs and the oil. Beat in 5 cups of the weighed-out flour to make a
batter. Beat for 5 minutes or until the batter begins to pull away
from the sides of the bowl. Knead in the remaining flour by machine
until smooth. Place the dough on a clean countertop and cover it with
a large metal bowl. Allow the dough to rise until double in bulk.
Punch the dough down and allow it to rise again. Punch the dough
down again and divide it in half. Cut each half into thirds. Roll 3
of the pieces into ropes about 16 inches long with your hands. Join 1
end of each rope and press together with the heel of your hand.
Alternately, braid the 3 ropse together and press the other 3 ends
together with the heel of your hand..
Sprinkle a large baking sheet with a little of the cornmeal.
Place the braided dough on the sheet pan and allow it to double in
bulk again. Repeat the process with the remaining dough. Allow the
dough to rise until double in bulk.
Beat the 2 egg yolks and 1 tablespoon of water together for the
egg wash. Lightly brush both risen braided doughs. Sprinkle with
sesame seeds.
Bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 50 to 60 minutes, until loaves
are deep golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottoms
with your finger. Remove to a cooling rack. Source: Whole Family
