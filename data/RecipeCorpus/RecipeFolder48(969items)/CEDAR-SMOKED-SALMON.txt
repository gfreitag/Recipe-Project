Title: CEDAR-SMOKED SALMON
Categories: Main dish, Fish
Yield: 6 Servings
3 lb Center-cut salmon, cut
--almost all the way through
--into 6 steaks
1    Lemon, thinly sliced
Salt & pepper
Sprigs of fresh dill
6 tb Butter, melted
Cedar pieces (see below)*
*Untreated cedar pieces are sold by the bundle at most lumberyards
and some hardware stores. Soak untreated cedar pieces (1 piece about
6' x 12", 6 pieces about 3" x 6") in a pan of water overnight or
place in a large pot of water and bring to a boil over med-high heat.
Drain.

Preheat oven to 450 F.  Place large cedar board on a foil-lined cookie
sheet.  Season salmon with salt and pepper, then lay it on the cedar
and slip smaller cedar pieces, a few lemon slices, and a few dill
sprigs (reserve some lemon and dill for garnish) between each steak.
Brush all over with butter.

Roast until salmon is pink, 20-25 minutes.  Remove salmon from oven.
Take smaller pieces of cedar out from between steaks and scatter over
salmon, then wrap tightly with foil and set aside to finish "cooking"
~ and to set smoky flavor - for 15 mintues.  (For a more well-done
fish, return wrapped salmon to oven and roast for 5 minutes.) Unwrap,
and, when salmon is cool enough to handle, finish slicing the fish.
Serve steaks garnished with reserved lemon slices and fresh dill, if
desired.
