NOTES:

*  A Mexican meat and bean dish, similar to chili -- I got this
recipe from "A Primer on Bean Cookery" by the California Dry Bean
Advisory Board. While not a true chili, chalupa is a Mexican-American
favorite for a hearty lunch or supper. It may be made ahead and
reheated, and it freezes well.

*  Chili powder is a mixture of spices, consisting mainly of ground
dried chili peppers.  This recipe may be served with corn chips and
condiments (including chopped tomato, chopped avocado, chopped onion,
shredded lettuce, grated cheddar cheese and hot sauce).

: Difficulty:  Easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 5-6 hours cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
