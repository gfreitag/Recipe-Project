Because caribou has so little fat, you'll need to add some pork for a
juicy burger.

Mix all the ingredients handling as little as possible. Heat grill or
broiler. Brush burgers with vegetable oil and grill about 4 minutes;
turn and cook to desired doneness. Serve on rolls with your choice of
condiments.
