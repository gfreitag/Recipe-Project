The color of carrots symbolizes prosperity.

In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine carrots and l/2 cup
water. Bring to a simmer over low heat; cover and cook slowly until
soft, about 30 minutes. With a potato masher, mash the carrots and
any remaining liquid. Stir in sugar, orange juice and lemon juice.
Return to a simmer over low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until
a thick paste forms, 50 to 60 minutes. Stir in ginger and cinnamon.
Let stand until cool enough to handle.

Sprinkle a small cutting board and rolling pin with water. Turn carrot
mixture onto the board and roll into a l/2" thick rectangle. Sprinkle
generously with sugar. Let stand, covered with cheesecloth or a
towel, for one day, until the top feels dry. Cut into 1" wide strips.
Turn and sprinkle the other side of the strips generously with sugar.
Let stand, covered with cheesecloth or a towel, for another day. Turn
the strips daily, until the candy is dry, up to 4 days. After the
strips feel crisp, cut into 1" diameter squares. Sprinkle again with
sugar. (Store in an airtight container for up to 1 month.)

Yield: About 30 candies.
