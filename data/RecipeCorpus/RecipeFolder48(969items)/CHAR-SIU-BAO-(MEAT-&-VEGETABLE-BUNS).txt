8 c  Water
2 ea Tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
3 ea Tb Oil
8 ts Dry yeast
4 c  Warm water (more or less,
- according to quality of
- flour)
Mix all A ingredients thoroughly in a bowl to form filling for buns.
Mix dry yeast with water and add to flour. Add other B ingredients
and knead into a soft dough. After dough is well kneaded, place in
floured bowl and cover.  Allow dough to rise for 1 hour in a warm
place. When dough has risen, knead it again on a flour-sprinkled
board and roll it into a long sausage. Cut sausage into 1-inch
lengths, flatten these pieces, and roll each out to the size of a
saucer to form wrapping. Put 1 tablespoon of filling in center of
each wrapping, flute edges of wrapping, bring egdes together to form
a sack, and seal by giving a slight twist and pinching with thumb and
forefinger. Place buns in steamer rack on a wet cloth and steam for
15 to 20 minutes. Note: Leftover buns may be served after reheating,
either by steaming or frying. The filling (A) may also be fried to
produce an altogether different and delightful flavor. Source; Mrs.
