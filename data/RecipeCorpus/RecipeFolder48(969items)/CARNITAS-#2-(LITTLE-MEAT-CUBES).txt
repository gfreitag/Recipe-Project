Title: CARNITAS #2 (LITTLE MEAT CUBES)
Categories: Pork
Yield: 1 Servings
1/4 c  Lard or vegetable oil
1 cl Garlic; minced
2 lb Lean boneless pork butt; cut
-into 1" cubes
Salt to taste
Paprika
1/2 c  Fresh orange juice
Heat the oil or lard in a large, heavy dutch oven until almost
smoking. Add minced garlic.  Spread the pork over the bottom and
season with salt and paprika to taste. Reduce heat to medium and
saute until meat is golden on all sides -- 15 to 20 mins.  Do not
crowd pan. (You may have to saute meat in two batches).

When meat has been sauteed, remove with a slotted spoon, and pour
off fat. Return meat to Dutch oven and add orange juice. Stir
frequently over high heat until boiling. Reduce heat and simmer,
uncovered, until liquid is thickened, and orange juice has formed a
glaze on the pork -- about 10 to
12    mins.

Cover and bake in a preheated 300~ oven until meat is very tender,
about 30 mins.  Serve with salsa and tortillas.
