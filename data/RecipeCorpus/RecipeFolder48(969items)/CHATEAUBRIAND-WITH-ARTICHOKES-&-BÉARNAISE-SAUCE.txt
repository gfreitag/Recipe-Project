Categories: Beef, French
Yield: 8 Servings
8 lg Artichokes
2    Beef tenderloin roast;
-2 lb each
1 ts Salt
Pepper, cracked black;
-to taste
Béarnaise sauce
Prepare the artichokes; cut off the stem and cut off two-thirds of the
tops, leaving at least one-inch bottoms. Cook the bottoms; then cool
them slightly, and with a spoon scoop out and discard the fuzzy
"chokes". Return the artichokes to the cooking liquid and keep them
warm.

Prepare coals of grill:  place coals on each side so that the meat is
not directly over medium hot coals. Rub pepper over the beef loins,
then sprinkle with salt. Grill until a meat thermometer registers 145
F. (medium rare).

To serve, with a slotted spoon, remove the artichoke bottoms from the
cooking liquid, and drain them on paper towels.  Spoon some béarnaise
sauce into the center of the artichokes. Slice the meat thickly;
arrange the meat on the center of a warm platter and surround with
the stuffed artichokes.
