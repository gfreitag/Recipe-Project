Fill a very large pot with water.  Add about 1 t of salt for each
quart of water in the pot.  Add the lasagna noodles. Make sure that
you cook enough noodles to cover a 13x9 baking pan 6 layers deep.
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F.

Grease the inside of the baking pan with a light vegetable oil. Now
make three filling layers.  For each, put down 1/3 of the noodles, in
two layers. Then spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture on the noodles.
Then sprinkle with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese. Finally, top with
1/3 of the sauce.  Bake uncovered for 40-45 minutes or until bubbly
hot. Let sit for 5-10 minutes before serving.
