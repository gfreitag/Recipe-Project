This creole pork sausage is a local favorite dating well back into the
nineteenth century.  Its firm texture and hearty, spicy flavor make
it an excellent accompaniment to red or white beans and rice or
grilled as a breakfast sausage. ~

Prepare sausage casings by soaking them in cold water for an hour,
then running cold water through them. Cut off a 3 yard length. Repack
the rest and refrigerate for later use.

Cut the pork and fat into small pieces with a sharp knife. Mix
together and run once through the coarse blade of the meat grinder,
placing a large bowl in front of the grinder to catch the meat. Add
seasonings and mix vigorously with a wooden spoon or large stiff wire
whisk until stuffing is fluffy and very smooth.

Cut casing into 16 inch lengths and stuff.

To cook, place in a large heavy skillet or saute pan with about 1/4
inch cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, cover the pan, then
reduce heat to low and cook for about 15 minutes. Uncover, raise heat
to medium and cook until sausage is well browned on all sides, about
10 minutes longer, turning frequently with tongs. Drain on paper
towels. Allow one chaurice per person. [-=PAM=-]
