Categories: Cakes, Friends
Yield: 1 Cake
6 lg Eggs, separated
3 c  Sugar
1 c  Butter
3 c  Flour, plain
1/2 ts Baking soda
Sour cream (small carton)
1 ts Vanilla extract
2 c  Pecans, chopped
Grease tube pan; preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Set two sticks of
butter aside to soften.  Separate eggs; beat whites till stiff and
set aside.

Cut butter into sugar.  Add egg yolks and beat a little.

Measure flour; use a small amount to mix with nuts until they are
well-floured.  Mix soda into flour. Stir flour into butter/sugar/egg
mixture.  Add sour cream and vanilla. Can do all this with an electric
mixer, but now use a spoon to fold in egg whites.

Fold in nuts and bake approximately 1 1/2 hours until done.
