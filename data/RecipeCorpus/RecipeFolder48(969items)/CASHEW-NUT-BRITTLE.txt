Title: CASHEW NUT BRITTLE
Categories: Desserts, Candies, Holiday
Yield: 1 Servings
-Dottie Cross TMPJ72B
2 c  Granulated sugar
1 c  Light corn syrup
1 c  (2 sticks) unsalted butter
1/2 c  Water
3 c  Unsalted raw cashew nuts;
-coarsely chopped
2 ts Baking soda
1 ts Vanilla extract
Butter 2 baking sheets and set aside. Butter the sides of a 3-quart
saucepan, and add the sugar, corn syrup, butter, and water. Stir over
low heat until the butter has melted. Increase the heat and bring the
mixture to a boil. Continue cooking over moderate heat, without
stirring, for about 20 minutes, until the temperature reaches 275
degrees F. (soft-crack stage) on a candy thermometer. Add the cashew
nuts and continue cooking for about 5 minutes, until the candy
thermometer registers 295 degrees F. (hard crack stage.) You may stir
occasionally, if necessary. Remove from the heat and immediately sift
the baking soda evenly over the surface. (Be careful---the syrup will
foam up.) Add the vanilla and stir to distribute the soda and vanilla
throughout the mixture. Pour at once onto the prepared baking sheets.
Tilt the sheets to spread the brittle about 1/2-inch thick. Allow to
cool until firm. Break the brittle into pieces and store in an
airtight container. Variation: Peanuts or other nuts can be added
instead of the cashews, or you can use a combination of several nuts.
Always choose the raw unsalted nuts that are available in health-food
and speciality stores. The nuts will cook and "toast" when added to
the hot syrup. Makes abouy 2 pounds.
