Clean calamari and cut tubes crosswise into 1/2" rings. Dry calamari
on paper towels and reserve. In a medium frying pan, heat 1 Tbs. oil
over medium-high heat. Add the calamari and saute until the rings

Add chile pepper and heat until it turns dark. Remove chile with a
slotted spoon and discard. Add the onions to the hot chile oil and
cook, stirring, until onions are wilted, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat
to medium, partially cover pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until
onions are caramelized (golden brown), 30-40 minutes. (Add more oil
if onions are dry or stick to the pan). Season with salt/pepper. Add
calamari and stir until heated throughout. Serve with slices of hot
or toasted French bread.
