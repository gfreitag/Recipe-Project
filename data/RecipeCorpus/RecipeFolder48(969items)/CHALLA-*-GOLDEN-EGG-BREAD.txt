2    Eggs

Combine all ingredients in the pan in the order listed and select
white bread; push start When we make this into Challa, we remove from
the breadmaker after the manual mode stops, (first rise); and then
braid* and rise again; then put an egg wash over the challa.

BAKE in a 350 degree oven until a light toasty brown. We usually
sprinkle on some type of seeds (sesame or poppy) after the egg wash.

* Braiding in the flat manner. The middle one goes under and over;
never across.
