1 tb Russian vodka
2 tb Club soda or seltzer

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the matzoh meal and eggs. Add the salt
and vodka, club soda, chicken broth, and oil and mix well. Cover and
put in the freezer for 20 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, bring a deep pot of water to a boil. Reduce the heat to
a simmer. Slowly lower 2-tablespoon-size scoops of the matzoh mixture
into the water, one at a time, until all is used up. It's ok to crowd
the matzoh balls. Cover the pot and cook for 40 minutes. Drain the
matzoh balls in a colander.

serve, figuring 2-3 matzoh balls per eater.

Makes: 18 large matzoh balls, serves 6-9.
