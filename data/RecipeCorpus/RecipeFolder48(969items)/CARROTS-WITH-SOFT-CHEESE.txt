Title: CARROTS WITH SOFT CHEESE
Categories: Vegetables
Yield: 2 Servings
450 g  Carrots
1    Bouquet garni
100 g  Low-fat fromage blanc
1 sm Orange; juiced
Black pepper
Grated nutmeg
1 sm Bunch of fresh chives
Serves 2-3

The really fresh flavours and soft textures of this unusual carrot
dish make a lovely meal. Serve it on a bed of noodles, with a
side-salad and some fresh bread to mop up the juices.

Peel, wash and cut carrots into strips. Cook in boiling water with the
bouquet garni for 3-4 minutes until tender but still crisp. Remove the
bouquet garni. Cool while you prepare the sauce.

Season the fromage blanc with the orange juice, pepper, grated nutmeg
and chopped chives. Spoon the cold sauce over the warm carrots and
serve.
