Title: CATHE'S BAKED BEANS
Categories: Legumes, Cathe
Yield: 1 Batch
1/2 lb Bacon
3 md Onions, chopped
2 c  Brown sugar
1/4 c  Yellow mustard (prepared)
1/4 c  Maple syrup
Campbell's pork/beans
-(2 28-oz cans)
Fry all but 3 strips of bacon until crispy.  (Can do this in two
batches in an 8-cup pyrex cup in the microwave. Try high setting for
4 minutes, stir bacon, and cook another 2 to 4 minutes or until
done.) Remove to paper-towel covered plate and reserve. Crumble when
cooled.

Pour out all but 1/2" of bacon grease in the bottom of the cup. Stir
in the chopped onion and saute until clear (but not brown), stirring
every now and then. (Probably do this on high in batches of 2
minutes.) When onion is done, stir in the brown sugar and cook on
high another minute or two, until the mixture is bubbly hot. Add
mustard and maple syrup and stir to blend well.

Combine beans, crumbled bacon, and sauce mixture in a large (9x14x2
inch) baking dish.  Top with strips of raw bacon. Bake uncovered at
350 degrees F. for an hour or so, or until the bacon is done and the
dish is bubbly and the liquid has cooked down some. Do not cook until
dry. Serve hot or cold.
