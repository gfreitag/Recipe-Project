Title: CAULIFLOWER AL-SHAMI
Categories: Vegetables, Lebanese, Vegan
Yield: 2 Servings
1/2 lg Cauliflower
4 tb Olive oil
2    Garlic cloves; sliced
1 sm Bunch of coriander, chopped
A superb way of cooking cauliflower, given to me by a Lebanese chef.
The florets are stir-fried with olive oil, garlic and lots of fresh
coriander, and the result is irresistible.

Cut the cauliflower into tiny florets. Heat the olive oil gently and
sautÂ‚ the sliced garlic in it until soft, about 2-3 minutes. Turn the
heat up and stir-fry the cauliflower florets for a further 2-3
minutes, tossing so that they are well coated with the oil. Turn the
heat down, partially cover with a lid, and cook until soft, about 4
minutes. Stir in the chopped coriander, toss for 1 minute more, and
serve.
