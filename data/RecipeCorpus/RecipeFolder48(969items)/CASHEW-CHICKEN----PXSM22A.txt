add the bamboo shoots and the green pepper to the wok (or fry pan if
you don't have a wok). Cook for a minute or two. Sprinkle a little of
the rice wine vinegar over the chicken/veggie mixture and cook
another minute. Add nuts and cook another minute. Pour sauce over the
contents of wok and cook until heated through. Serve over hot cooked
