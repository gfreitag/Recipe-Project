1    Pound cake, loaf;
-9"x5"
2 c  Ricotta cheese
4 oz Chocolate, semi-sweet
1 oz Orange liqueur
1 1/2 c  Raspberry jam

Chill pound cake for 1 hour.  Trim edges and uneven pieces so cake is
level on all sides and top.  Slice cake horizontally into 1/2" slices
and place on serving platter.

Force cheese through a sieve into a bowl and beat until smooth. Chop
chocolate into fine bits in a blender. Mix chocolate bits with
liqueur and jam.

Spread a portion of cheese on the bottom layer; then spread that with
a portion of jam mixture.  Repeat until all layers are used, leaving
top plain.  Press down gently. Use a spatula to even all sides. Cover
with plastic wrap and refrigerate 24 hours.

Before serving, frost with chocolate frosting or whipped cream and
garnish with almonds.
