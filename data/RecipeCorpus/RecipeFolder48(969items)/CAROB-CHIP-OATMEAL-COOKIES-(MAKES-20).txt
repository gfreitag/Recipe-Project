Title: CAROB CHIP OATMEAL COOKIES (MAKES 20)
Categories: Cookies, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Stick margerine
3/4 c  Sucanat (or regular brown
-sugar)
1    "egg" (egg replacer)
1 1/2 ts Vanilla
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Whole wheat flour
3/4 ts Baking powder
1 1/2 c  Rolled oats
3/4 c  Dairy free carob chips
3/4 c  Chopped walnuts
1/4 c  Rice milk or soy milk (just
-enough to make the dough
-stick together; try not to
-use too much)
Preheat oven to 375.  In a bowl, mix up the margerine, sugar, egg
replacer, vanilla, salt, flour, and rolled oats. When well mixed, add
the milk, chips and walnuts and mix again. On a well-greased cookie
sheet, place small patties of cookie dough.  You will have to mold
them and press them down. They do not spread well, so don't make them
overly thick. Cook the first batch for 12 minutes, and the second one
for 10.
