Categories: Candies, Holiday, Spanish
Yield: 1 Pound
MMMMM------------------------NORMA WRENN-----------------------------
1 1/3 c  Honey
2    Egg whites; stiffly beaten
1/2 lb Almonds; blanched; peeled
-kept warm
3 1/2 oz Hazelnuts; roasted; peeled
Kept warm (about 3/4 cup)
Edible rice paper
Put the honey in a heavy saucepan and place over medium heat. Stir it
with a wooden spoon and when the honey begins to boil, remove the pan
from the heat. Continue stirring until the honey thins to the
consistency of pancake syrup.  Stir in the egg whites and return the
mixture to the heat; continue cooking until it reaches a toffee-like
consistency (hard-ball stage). Stir in the nuts and mix well.

Spread the mixture in a jelly-roll pan lined with edible rice paper.
Cover with a second sheet of rice paper and weight the top. Let it
cool, then cut the nougat into 1-inch squares.

When making nougat, the nuts should be warm.  Cover freshly peeled
nuts with foil to retain the warmth they gained in blanching or
roasting; wrap previously peeled nuts in foil and warm them in a
200-degree F. oven for 15 minutes.
