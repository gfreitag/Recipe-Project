Title: CEYLON TEA BUTTER SAUCE
Categories: Sauces
Yield: 1 Servings
1 md Shallot; chopped (1 1/2 tb)
2/3 c  Ceylon Tea-Infused Vinegar
-(see recipe)
1/4 ts Salt; (scant)
1/8 ts Ground white pepper
3 tb Heavy cream
14 tb Unsalted butter; in pieces
Combine the shallot, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a nonaluminum
saucepan and reduce over medium-high heat until almost dry. Add the
cream and reduce by one third. Then, whisking constantly, whisk in
the pieces of butter a few at a time, adding more as the butter is

heat. Use immediately or keep warm for up to 2 hours in a thermos.

Serve with Sole Steamed on a Bed of Ceylon Tea.
