Title: CERELIAC GRATIN
Categories: None
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Celeriac, scrubbed & clean
1    Lemon
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1 tb Vegetable oil
2    Scallions trimmed & chopped
2 tb Flour
1/2 c  Milk
1/2 c  Grated Gruyere cheese
1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
1/4 ts Salt
1/8 ts Pepper
2 tb Grated Parmesan
1 ts Paprika
Squeeze the juice of the lemon in a large bowl of cold water. Peel the
cereliac and cut it into 1/4-inch-thick slices. To keep them from
discoloring, drop the slices into the water as you work.

Drain the slices put them into a saucepan add the stock. Bring to
boil and simmer over medium heat until the cereliac is tender, 10 to
12 minutes. Keep the liquid.

Preheat the broiler.

To prepare the sauce, first heat the oil in a small saucepan over
medium heat, add the scallions and cook them until they are soft. (2
~ 3 minutes) Whisk the flour, cook one minute. Whisk the milk. Spoon
the liquid from the boiled cereliac and add it to the saucepan. Cook
the mixture whisking constantly until it thickens, about one minute.
Stir in the Gruyere, nutmeg, salt and pepper.

Place carefully the slices of cereliac in a gratin dish. Pour the
sauce over them. Scatter the Parmesan over and sprinkle with paprika.
Broil the dish until the top turns golden - about 2 minutes.

Enjoy!
