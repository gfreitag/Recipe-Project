_____________________ smoothing secrets prevent lumps by stirring
flour into melted butter with a wire whisk, gradually add the half
and half white stirring constantly. cook four mixture over medium
heat; high heat can cause it to curdle _____________________
eggsclusive secrets carefully separate cold eggs stirring a small
amount of hot mixture into beaten egg yolks warms them. This step --
called tempering -- prevents the egg yolks from lumping (coagulating)
_______________________ puffing secrets even the smallest amount of
fat, including that in a ddrop of yolk, keeps the egg white from
beating properly. Because wooden and plastic bowls tend to absorb fat
avoid using them when beating egg whites stiff but not dry mean egg
whites no longer slip when the bowl is titled. To fold in a beated
egg white, use a down-across-up-and-over motion with a rubber spatual
to cut through the carrot mixture. Fold just until there aren't any
remaining streaks.  don't stir -- it forces out the air in the beaten
white. ___________________ dish size is important; if the container
is too small, the mixture may run over, if the container is too large
the mixture won't rise to the rim and have it tradition appearance.
Use a straight-sided casserole if you don't have a traditional
souffle dish. _______________________ BAKING SECRETS Place souffle
into a preheated oven immediately after mixing. Don't peek, opening
the oven door will cause a souffle to collapse. the top will be
slightly firm to the touch.
