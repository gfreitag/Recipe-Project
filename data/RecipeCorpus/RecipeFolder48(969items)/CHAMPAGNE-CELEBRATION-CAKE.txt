Grease and lightly flour one 9" round pan and one 13x9x2 pan; set

beat 2 minutes. (Batter may appear slightly curdled.) Spread 2-3/4
cups batter in 9" pan and remaining batter in 13x9x2 pan. Bake at
350~F 30-35 minutes for round cake and 40-45 minutes for rectangular
cake or until cake tests done. Cool cakes in pans on racks 10
minutes. Remove from pans and cool completely. Using cardboard circle
patterns of 4 and 6 inches, cut one 4-inch and one 6-inch cake layer
from the 13x9x2 cake. If desired, drizzle 3 tablespoons of champagne
over the top of each round cake layer. Place the 9-inch cake layer on
a serving plate; frost sides and top. Lining up the backs of the
layers, place the 6-inch cake on top of the 9-inch cake; frost sides
and top. Repeat with remainging 4-inch cake. If desired, tint any
remaining frosting; decorate with tinted frosting and flowers. Serves
