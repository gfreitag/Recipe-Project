Categories: Diabetic, Desserts, Quickbreads, Breadmaker
Yield: 12 Servings
Nonstick vegetable spray
1 c  Flour
2 tb Wheat germ, toasted
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1 ts Baking soda
1/2 ts Salt
2 ts Brown sugar substitute
1 ts Cinnamon
1/8 ts Cloves
1/8 ts Nutmeg
1 1/3 c  Carrots, shredded
1/2 c  Raisins, soaked in hot water
2    Eggs
2 tb Vegetable oil
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Spray muffin tins.  (My suggestion: spray
paper muffin cups - low fat muffins tend to stick.)

Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl.  Stir in carrots and drained
raisins.

Beat eggs with oil.  Stir into flour mixture.  Divide batter evenly
among 12 tins.  Bake for 30-35 minutes or until toothpick inserted in
center of muffin comes out clean.
