Categories: Korean, Condiment
Yield: 16 Servings
4 lb Chinese cabbage (the long-

1/4 lb Chinese turnip
2 cn Flat anchovies
4    Cloves Garlic (or 5)
3    Scallions
1/4 c  Salt
4 tb Hot pepper flakes
2 tb Cayenne pepper
1.  Remove the large outside leaves of the cabbage. Cut them in half
lengthwise, then cut across the grain into 2-inch lengths. Cut all the
inside leaves into 2-inch lengths at the same time. Place the cabbage
in a very large pot.

2.  Quarter the turnip, then slice across the grain holding the 4
quarters together for more speed and convenience in slicing.

3.  Pour the oil from the anchovies over the cabbage and turnip.
Slice the anchovies across the grain. Crush the garlic. Cut the
scallions into 2-inch lengths, then slice thin lengthwise. Add these
ingredients to the pot. Season with salt, pepper flakes and cayenne
pepper, and mix thoroughly. Cover the pot and let the mixture stand
at room temperature for 2 days. Casual kimchi will keep at least 10
days. Refrigerate in a jar.
