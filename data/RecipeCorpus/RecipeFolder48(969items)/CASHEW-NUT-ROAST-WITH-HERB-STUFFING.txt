Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Vegetarian
Yield: 1 Roast
2 oz Butter (or margarine -K.M.)
1 lg Onion; sliced
8 oz Unroasted cashew nuts
4 oz White bread; crusts removed
2 lg Garlic cloves
7 fl Water or light veg. stock
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Grated nutmeg
1 tb Lemon juice
MMMMM----------------------FOR THE STUFFING---------------------------
4 oz White breadcrumbs
2 oz Butter (or margarine)
1 sm Onion; grated
1/2 ts Thyme
1/2 ts Marjoram
1 oz Parsley; chopped
MMMMM-------------------------TO GARNISH------------------------------
Parsley sprigs
Lemon slices
Set the oven to 200C/400F/Gas Mark 6 and line a 450 g/1lb loaf tin
with a long strip of nonstick paper; use some of the butter to grease
the tin and paper well. Melt most of the remaining butter in a medium
sized saucepan, add the onion and fry for about 10 minutes until
tender but not browned. Remove from the heat.

Grind the cashew nuts in a food processor with the bread and garlic,
and add to the onion, together with the water or stock, salt, pepper,
grated nutmeg and lemon juice to taste.

Mix all the stuffing ingredients together.

Put half the cashew nut mixture into the prepared tin, top with the
stuffing, then spoon the rest of the nut mixture on top. Dot with the
remaining butter.  Stand the tin in another tin to catch any butter
which may ooze out, and bake for about 30 minutes, or until firm and
lightly browned.  (Cover the roast with foil if it gets too brown
before then.)

Cool for a minute or two in the tin, then slip a knife around the
sides, turn out the nut roast and strip off the paper. Decorate with
sprigs of parsley and small slices of lemon, and surround with roast
potatoes, if you're serving them.
