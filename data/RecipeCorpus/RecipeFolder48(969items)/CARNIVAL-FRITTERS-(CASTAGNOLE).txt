Title: CARNIVAL FRITTERS (CASTAGNOLE)
Categories: Breads, Desserts, Ethnic
Yield: 18 Servings
1 c  Hot Water
8 tb Unsalted Butter
1 tb Sugar
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  All-Purpose Flour, Sifted
4    Eggs
1 ts Freshly Grated Orange Rind
1 ts Freshly Grated Lemon Rind
4 c  Peanut Oil
Confectioners Sugar
Combine the water, butter, sugar, and salt in a small sauce pan and
bring to a boil. When butter is melted, add flour. Stir vigorously
with a whisk until the mixture leaves the sides of the pan, a matter
of seconds. Remove from heat and cool slightly.

Add the eggs, one at a time, beating vigorously with a spoon after
each addition. Add the grated orange and lemon rinds. Mix thoroughly
until smooth.

In a deep skillet, heat the peanut oil to 300Â° F (the temperature is
important because if the oil is too hot, the fritters will cook too
fast on the outside and not puff up.)

Drop the batter by the tablespoonful into the hot oil, no more than 4
or 5 at a time. When the fritters are browned and puffed, remove them
with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with
confectioners sugar.
