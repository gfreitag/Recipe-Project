-More?
1 ts Salt
2 c  Grated zucchini
2 ts Vanilla
3 ts Cinnamon
1/4 ts Baking powder
3 c  Flour
1 c  Nuts (optional; I left them
-out)
Mix wet ingredients, then add dry ingredients. Pour into 2 loaf pans.
Bake for one hour at 350 F.

This recipe doubles very easily. I could have made 4 loaves, but I
only had 3 loaf pans. I made 3 loaves, and some zucchini muffins.
