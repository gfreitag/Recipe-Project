a frying pan on the stove over medium heat.  Keep the pan hot. 5.
Cook the bacon slices in the pan. 6. Grill the burger for 3 to 4
minutes per side, or until done. Salt each side. 7. Spread 1
tablespoon of the barbecue sauce on the faces of each bun, top and

Next stack the burger, then the cheese and the 2 bacon slices,
crossed over each other. 9. Top off the sandwich with the top bun.
