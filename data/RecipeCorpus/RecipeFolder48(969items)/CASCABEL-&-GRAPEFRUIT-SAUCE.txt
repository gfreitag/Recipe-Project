Title: CASCABEL & GRAPEFRUIT SAUCE
Categories: Mexican, Marinades, Fruits
Yield: 6 Servings
24    Dried Cascabel Pepper
-See Note
3 c  Water
6    Cloves Garlic
4 c  Fresh Grapefruit juice
1 c  Fresh Orange juice
3 ts Allspice (Jamaican)
1 ts Salt
: NOTE: Cascabel Peppers, this pepper is small (1 1/2 inch or so),
round and dark brown. This is the "little rattles" pepper that comes
from the Veracruz area. This pepper is not elongated, not black, not
from South America, and not real hot. Cascabel is also known as the
chili bola. : METHOD: Remove stem and seed from chiles. With a comal
or black iron skillet, or in an oven at 250 degrees, dry roast chiles
for 3 to 4 minutes. Shake once or twice and do not allow to blacken.
Add to the water in a covered pan and simmer very low for 20 minutes
to rehydrate. Allow to cool. SEE HINT. Taste the chile water, and if
not bitter, add about 1/2 cup and the chiles to a blender (use plain
water if bitter). Puree together with the garlic and strain. Add the
fruit juices, allspice, and salt and mix together. : HINT: If a very
smooth sauce is required, pass the rehydrated, coarsely chopped,
chiles through a food mill, then proceed as above.
