2 c  Pureed cooked carrots

2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1 c  Vegetable shortening
Ice water
FILLING AND ASSEMBLY: Heat oven to 450 degrees.  Mix all ingredients
together at medium speed of electric mixer, blending thoroughly. Pour
into pie shell and bake at 450 degrees for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to
325 degrees and continue cooking for 45 minutes, or until pie is set.
Let cool about 10 minutes before serving. PIECRUST: Mix flour and
salt together in a bowl. Cut vegetable shortening into flour until
mixture resembles course meal. Sprinkle with ice water, 1 tablespoon
at a time, mixing quickly with a fork after each spoonful. Add only
enough water so dough holds together and can be formed into a ball.
Divide dough into 2 equal portions and form each into a smooth ball,
handling as little as possible. Roll one portion out onto lightly
floured surface.  Place rolled dough in a 9-inch pie plate; trim and
flute edges.
