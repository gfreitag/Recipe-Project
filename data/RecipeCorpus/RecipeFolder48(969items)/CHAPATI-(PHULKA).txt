White + 2/3 wh.
1/2 c  Water

aside for 30 minutes. 6. Knead and divide dough into 4 to 6 parts 7.
Roll each ball into a tortilla like flat, about 1/8" thick. 8. heat
an ungreased skillet. 9. Put phulka on it and let cook for about 1
minute. 10. Turn and cook the second side for 2/3 minute till small
bubbles form. 11. Turn again and cook the first side pressed lightly
with a towel. It should puff. Serve warm (maybe slightly buttered).

Note: As the rolled out chappatis will dry out if they are left stand
while cooking other,  it is advantageous to roll them out
individually before cooking them.

At step 9, the top should just start to look dry and small bubbles to
form.
