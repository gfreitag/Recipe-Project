Title: CAROL'S FAVORITE VEGETARIAN CHILI
Categories: Chili, Stews, Damyankee, Vegetarian
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lg Onion; chopped
3    Garlic clove; crushed &
-pressed
2 tb Oil
1    Celery rib; diced
1 1/2 ts Chili powder
1 ts Cumin
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
1 c  Tomato; chopped
2 tb Tomato paste
4 c  Beans, kidney, black, pinto
-and/or garbanzo; cooked
1/2 lb Tofu; crumbled (opt)
1 1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Oregano
Saute onion and garlic in oil until onion is soft. Add celery and
spices. Saute another 2-3 minutes. Add tomato and paste. Mash 2 cups
of the beans and add beans and tofu to the pot along with the salt
and oregano. Simmer 30 minutes.

To cook raw beans:

Soak beans in water overnight, OR boil for 2 minutes and let sit,
covered, for 1 hour.  Bring to a boil in same water and simmer about
1 hour or until tender. (beans approximately double in volume, i.e.,
two cups raw = 4 cups cooked)

Notes:  I like cooking my own beans rather than buying canned beans.
I use as many different beans as I have at home. Usually at
least 3 of the 4 mentioned, and one of the 3 must be black
beans because they are my absolute favorite.
Add or subtract cayenne pepper for hotness level.
A bit more cumin may be good too, I have yet to determine
