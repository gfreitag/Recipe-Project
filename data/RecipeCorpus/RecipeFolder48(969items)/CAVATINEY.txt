Boil a half bag of medium noodles. Brown one pound hamburger and one
pound sausage. Drain noodles and in a bowl mix hamburger, sausage and
mix in one jar pizza sauce and half a jar spagetti sauce. Grease a
baking dish with butter; (only a thin coat). Spoon in meat mixture.
Top with peperonni, mozzeralla cheese, and sharp sheddar cheese. On
top of that sparkle lightly with garlic powder. Put in oven on 350
degree's and bake until cheese melts. It taste like a pizza lasagne.
