cups stock, bay leaf, thyme, white pepper and coriander. Bring to
boil. Reduce heat, cover partially and simmer until vegetables are
very soft, about 25 minutes. Discard bay leaf and thyme sprigs.  Add
spinach to soup and cook until just wilted, stirring occasionally,
about 2 minutes.

Place soup in batches in processor.  Return soup to pot. Add cream and

Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to simmer before continuing.)

Ladle soup into bowls.  Sprinkle with croutons and serve.

"The Irish excel with root vegetables, and every home garden seems to
boast lush rows of celeriac, parsnips, turnips, leeks, rutabagas, and
potatoes. This savory bisque is a subtle and suave use of the humble
and often ignored celery root. Along with glasses of sherry, it makes
a great beginning to an elegant celebration of St. Patrick. Spinach
leaves add pretty green color to the bisque."
