1 tb Olive oil
1 kg Boneless pork, cubed
2 lg Onions, chopped
2    Cloves garlic, minced

100 ml Boiling water

Many years ago, restaurant dining meant fruit with every- thing. Now
fruit is desperately passe. But it's a mistake to throw out the
authentic with the spurious. This surprising but satisfying
combination of ingredients originates in South America.

In a large saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and brown on all
sides 1 kg cubed boneless pork. Add 2 large onions, chopped, and 2
cloves of garlic, minced, and brown them. Add 3 large tomatoes,
diced, 100 mL boiling water and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and
cook very slowly for about 1 1/2 hour. Meanwhile simmer 1 1/2 cups
brown lentils in 4 cups water for 45 minutes; do not drain.

Add the undrained lentils to the pork mixture, combine well, cover
and cook over a low heat for a further 30 minutes, until both the
pork and the lentils are tender.

Taste for seasoning. Add 4 large firm bananas cut into 2 cm pieces
and 3 tablespoons or more of chopped, fresh coriander. Cook 10
minutes longer. Serve with a little more coriander scat- tered on
top. (You can use the coriander stems as well as the leaves, provided
they are well washed. Finely chopped they add interesting crunch.)
