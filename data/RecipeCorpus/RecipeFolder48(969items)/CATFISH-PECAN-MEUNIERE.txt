Title: CATFISH PECAN MEUNIERE
Categories: Cooking liv, Fish
1 c  flour
Yield: 4 Servings
4 ts Rustic Rub
2    eggs -- beaten
1/2 c  milk
4    catfish or trout fillets --
(6 to 6 1/2 oz
each)
:
:
1/2 c  vegetable oil
1    stick (1/4 pound) butter
1 c  pecan pieces
4 TB chopped parsley
2 TB minced garlic
2 TB fresh lemon juice
1/4 c  Worcestershire sauce
1/4 c  heavy cream
1 ts salt
1/4 ts cayenne

Combine the flour with 2 teaspoons of the rub in a shallow bowl. In
another shallow bowl, blend the eggs and milk together. Season the
fish with the remaining 2 teaspoons rub. Heat the oil in a large
nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge the fillets in the
flour, coating evenly. Dip the fillets in the egg mixture. Dredge
again in the flour. When the oil is hot, but not smoking, lay the
fillets in the skillet. Pan-fry for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or
until golden. Transfer to a warm platter. Discard any oil remaining
in the skillet and wipe clean with paper towels. Return the skillet
to the stove. Over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the
butter. When the butter foams, add the pecans and stir constantly for
about 1 1/2 minutes, or until lightly toasted. Add the parsley,
garlic, lemon juice, Worcestershire, and cream. Stir with a whisk for
about 15 seconds and remove from the heat. Add the salt, cayenne, and
remaining 6 tablespoons butter, broken into small chips, and stir
until the butter melts completely. Spoon the sauce over the fillets
and serve.
