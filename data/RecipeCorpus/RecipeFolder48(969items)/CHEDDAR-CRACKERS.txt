++++++++++++++ ++++ Stir the dry ingredients into a bowl and then cut
in the butter to resemble cornmeal. Blend in the cheddar cheese with
a fork until well blended. Mix in the remaining ingredients and shape
into 1 1/2 to 2-inch rolls. Chill for 30 to 40 minutes in the
refrigerator and then slice each roll into slices about 1/4-inch
thick.  Bake on an ungreased cookie sheet at 400 degrees F for about
10 minutes. Remove from cookie sheet and let cool. Store the cooled
crackers in airtight containers in a cool place. They will keep for
several weeks this way and if you freeze them, they will last
indefinitely.
