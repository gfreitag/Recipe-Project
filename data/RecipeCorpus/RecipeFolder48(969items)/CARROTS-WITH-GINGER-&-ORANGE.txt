Title: CARROTS WITH GINGER & ORANGE
Categories: Salads, Vegetables
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb (scant) maincrop carrots
3 sm Oranges
Fresh ginger root
1 sm Garlic clove
1 oz Walnut kernals
1 sm Bunch of mint
1 ts Honey
1 ts Lemon juice
Olive oil
First make the dressing.  Finely grate the zest of 1 orange into a
bowl. Add its juice, the honey and lemon juice and 1 tablespoon olive
oil. Peel 1/2 inch or so of ginger and chop it as finely as possible;
then crush the small garlic clove.  Add both these ingredients to the
bowl with a little salt and pepper. Mix well then push 2 sprigs of
mint into the liquid.

Scrub and scrape the carrots, or peel them if you insist, then grate
them coarsely and add to the dressing. Peel the remaining 2 oranges
and cut into segments; be ruthless about cutting away all traces of
pith and the membrane that divides one segment from the next. Remove
pips (seeds) with the tip of a knife and add the oranges to the salad
bowl. Mix all the ingredients together gently, then cover the salad
and set it aside for 2 hours or a little longer to allow flavours to
blend and develop.

Close to serving time, remove and discard the tired sprigs of mint,
stir in the walnuts and scatter with fresh torn mint leaves.
