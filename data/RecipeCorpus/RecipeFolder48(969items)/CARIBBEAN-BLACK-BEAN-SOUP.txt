Categories: Soup, Vegetarian
Yield: 8 Servings    8 oz black beans, washed and soaked overnight
7 c  low-sodium chicken stock, or water (7-8 cups)
1/2 c  flat beer
3/4 c  dark rum
4    cloves garlic, minced
2 md onions, diced
2 tb butter or margarine
1 c  celery, finely chopped
1    green bell pepper, seeded and diced
1    red bell pepper, seeded and diced
1    to 2 chili peppers, seeded and minced
2 lg carrots, peeled and diced
1/2 c  canned crushed tomatoes
1 1/2    Tbs. ground cumin
1 ts red hot sauce
1/2 tb chile powder
1/2 ts freshly ground black pepper
1/2 ts salt
1/4 ts cayenne pepper
1 tb fresh cilantro, minced Drain the black beans and combine
in a heavy saucepan with the stock, beer, rum, garlic and half of the
onions. Bring to simmer. Cook for 1 to 1 1/2 hours over low heat,
stirring occasionally. If the stock evaporates too quickly, reduce
the heat, add up to 2 cups of hot water and continue simmering. Melt
the butter in a saucepan and add the remaining onions, plus the
celery, peppers and carrots.  Saute over medium heat until the
vegetables are soft but not mushy, 5 to 7 minutes.  Set aside. When
the beans are soft, puree half of the mixture in a food processor
fitted with a steel blade. Return the puree to the saucepan and add
the sauteed vegetables, crushed tomatoes and seasonings. Bring to a
simmer and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a
little hot water or rum if it is too thick, or continue to simmer if
it is too thin. Serve at once with a dollop of yogurt or sour cream.
Freezes well.
