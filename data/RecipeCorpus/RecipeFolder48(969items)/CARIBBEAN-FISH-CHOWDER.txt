Many recipes come out of the Caribbean that people either like or
hate on first taste.  This particular recipe is for a chowder that is
excellent.

Heat the oil in a large soup pot.  Saute' the onion and garlic until
the onions are transluscent.  Add all of the other ingredients except
the shrimp, clams and the fish. Simmer for 1 hour or until the
veggetables are tender.  Add the seafood and cook for 7 to 10 minutes
at a low boil.

NOTE:  I have added on occassion 1/4 cup rice to this recipe and it
is good that way too.

Serves 8 to 10.
