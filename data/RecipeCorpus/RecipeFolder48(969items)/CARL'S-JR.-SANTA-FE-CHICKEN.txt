Categories: Chicken, Main dishes, Sandwiches, Meats
Yield: 1 Servings
2    Whole chicken breasts --
Skinned -- boned,halved
1 c  Teriyaki marinade (Lawry's
Is best)
1/4 c  Mayonnaise
1/4 ts Paprika
1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
1/4 ts Curry powder
1 pn Salt
4    Whole-wheat hamburger buns
4    Lettuce leaves
1 cn Mild green chili peppers
(4-ounce) -- well drained
4 sl American cheese
1.   Marinate the chicken in the teriayki marinade in a shallow bowl
for 30 minutes. 2.   Preheat a clean barbecue to medium grilling
heat. 3. Prepare the sauce in a small bowlby mixing the mayonnaise
with the paprika, cayenne pepper, curry powder, and salt. 4. Grill
the chicken for 5 to 8 minutes per side, or until done. 5. Brown the
faces of each bun in a hot frying pan. 6. Spread a tablespoon of
sauce on the faces of each bun, top and bottom. 7. On each bottom bun
place a lettuce leaf, then a green chili pepper.
You want the pepper to spread over most of the lettuce. To do this,
slice the pepper down the middle oand spread it open so that it
covers more territory. When sliced open like this, some peppers are
big enough for 2 sandwiches. Some are much smaller and enough for
only one sandwich. 8. Place one chicken breast half on each fo the
sandwiches, on top of the chili pepper. 9. Place a slice of American
cheese on the chicken. 10. Top it all off with the top bun. Makes 4
sandwiches.
