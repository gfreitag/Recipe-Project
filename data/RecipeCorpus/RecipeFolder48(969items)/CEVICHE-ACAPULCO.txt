O'Brien's, 3011 N. St. Mary's, San Antonio, Tx NOTE: Ceviche, or
Seviche, comes originally from Polynesia and has undergone changes
that make it a Mexican dish. Mexicans perfer to use fat fish as
mackerel or pompano for ceviche. Limes are preferred, although lemons
may be used, since both contain the citric acid that "cooks" the
fish. (According to Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz, The Complete Book of
Mexican Cooking) Posted by Clarence Fontish.
