Title: CASSEROLE OF SALT COD & POTATOES
Categories: Fish, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
1 lb Dried salt cod
6 c  Boiling water
1 tb Unsalted butter
3 tb Olive oil
1 lg Spanish onion
- peeled and sliced thin
2 lb Calif. long white potatoes
-or new potatoes,
-boiled until tender, then
-peeled and sliced thin
1/3 c  Minced parsley
1/4 c  Freshly ground black pepper
MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
1 lg Egg, hard-cooked, shelled
-and cut in thin wedges
12 md Oil-cured black olives
- (unpitted)
SOAK THE COD in the refrigerator 24 hours in several changes of cold
water. Drain, rinse, and drain well again. Place the cod in a large
heavy saucepan, pour in the boiling water, set over moderate heat,
cover and simmer 10-to-12 minutes--just until the cod flakes at the
touch of a fork. Drain and rinse well, then flake the cod, removing
any bits of skin or bone. Preheat the oven to 350F. In a large heavy
skillet set over moderate heat, warm the butter and 1 tablespoon of
the oil 1 minute. Add the onion, separating the slices into rings,
and stir-fry 8-to-10 minutes until limp and golden; do not brown.
Remove the onion from the skillet and set aside. Add the remaining
oil to the skillet, dump in the potatoes and stir-fry about 5 minutes
until golden. Layer half the potatoes in a well-buttered 2-quart
casserole or au gratin pan and sprinkle with a little of the minced
parsley and pepper. Add 1/3 of the onion, 1/2 of the cod and another
scattering of the parsley and pepper. Repeat the layering, ending
with onion rings on top. Sprinkle with the remaining pepper and all
but 1 tablespoon of the parsley. Bake the casserole, uncovered, for
35-to-40 minutes or until touched with brown. Garnish with wedges of
hard-cooked egg and the olives, placed artfully on top of the
casserole, plus a final light scattering of minced parsley.
