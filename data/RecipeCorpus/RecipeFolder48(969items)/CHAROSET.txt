NOTES:

*  Traditional Seder accompaniment -- This paste-like, sweet spread
is a prescribed part of the traditional Seder. Its mortar-like
consistency is intended to remind Jews of the bricks and mortar our
ancestors labored with as slaves in Egypt. Quite incidentally, it is
delicious and tastes wonderful spread on matzah. This is the
traditional charoset from the Ashkenazic (Eastern European) Jewish
tradition; very different, but equally delicious, charoset recipes,
using such ingredients as dates, raisins and sesame, can be found in
the various Sephardic communities (e.g., Yemenite, Persian, Turkish,
Moroccan, etc.).

*  This recipe yields about enough for the Seder table. If you like
this as much as we do, you will want to make more.

*  Some people prefer a chunkier, less smoothly-blended charoset.

*  If you live in an area where Kosher for Passover ground nuts (not
groundnuts) are available, they save a lot of chopping time and lead
to a smoother consistency. If you're lucky enough to have a Kosher
for Passover food processor, you will also save a lot of arm
exercise. And remember, kids love to chop!

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes to several hours, depending on how much
hand-chopping you have to do.
: Precision:  no need to measure.
