Title: CHAMPAGNE CHICKEN
Categories: Poultry, Main dish
Yield: 6 Servings
3 ea Chicken breast/boned/skinned
2 tb Olive oil
2 tb Butter
1/4 c  Champagne; dry
1/2 c  Heavy cream
3 tb Tarragon; fresh (1 t dry)
1 x  Salt & freshly ground pepper
1 x  ----optional ingredients----
6 ea Prosciutto slices/paper thin
3 ea Shallots; finely chopped
1 tb Butter or margarine
*** See instructions at end if using the optional ingredients. Cut
chicken into 1/4" wide slices. Melt the butter and olive oil in a
large heavy skillet. Saute the chicken for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the
chicken and keep warm. Deglaze the pan with the champagne. Add the
cream to the pan. Add the tarragon and reduce the sauce for two
minutes. Put the chicken back into the pan and bring just to a
simmer. Remove to serving platter. Serve hot with fresh vegetables or
over rice or pasta. (I serve this over fettucini, or with a side dish
of Fettucini Alfredo). *** Cut chicken breasts in half only. Place
each half between sheets of waxed paper and pound with a meat
tenderizer until about 1/8" thick. Saute shallots in butter until
tender. Divide shallots equally between the breast halves, spreading
evenly over each. Place one slice of prosciutto on each breast half,
fold in half, and secure with toothpicks. Saute about 4 to 5 minutes
on each side in the butter and olive oil listed in the original
ingredients. Chicken is done when it springs back when lightly
pressed with finger. Follow the balance of the instructions listed
above for the sauce. Source: The original recipe came from "The
Martha Culbertson Cook Booklet" published by Culbertson Winery. The
"additional ingredients" modification is my own.
