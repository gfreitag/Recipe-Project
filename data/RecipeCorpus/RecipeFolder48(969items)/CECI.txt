Recipe by: The Bean Cookbook, by Judith Choate Soak, rinse, and cook
chick peas.  Do not allow beans to get too soft. When tender but
still firm, remove from heat and drain well. Pat dry.

Preheat oven to 375F.  Melt butter in medium-sized saucepan over low
heat. Add vegetable oil and garlic and allow to sit for 5 minutes,
keeping warm.

Pour butter into large baking tray with sides.  Spread dried chick
peas on tray.  Bake 15 minutes, turning frequently, or until chick
peas are golden.

While chick peas are baking, combine spices and herbs. When chick
peas are done, remove from oven and sprinkle with herbs and spices
and toss to coat. Serve warm.

The cookbook also suggests that other combinations of herbs and spices
would work, for example, a combination of chili powder, cumin, and
cayenne.
