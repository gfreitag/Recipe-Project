Title: CARRAGEEN PUDDING WITH RHUBARB & ROSEHIP JELL
Categories: Desserts
Yield: 4 Servings
1 1/2 pt Milk
1    Strip lemon peel
1/2 oz Prepared dried carrageen *
1 tb Sugar
1    Egg
2    Sticks rhubarb **
4 tb Rosehip or redcurrant jelly
*Note: Carrageen is a purple-brown or green fronded seaweed common on
Scottish beaches on the mid-tide line. It can be used to set and
delicately flavour a jelly or thicken a soup. If you gather your own
fresh, you will need about 2 oz to set a pint of milk. Dried
carrageen is available in health-food stores, or Chinese supermarkets
in processed form, as agar-agar. **Rhubarb sticks should be sliced
and lightly poached with additional sugar.

Bring the milk to the boil with the lemon rind.  Stir in the
carrageen and cook for a couple of minutes until the milk thickens
enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Add sugar.

Allow the mixture to cool until it is at blood temperature (100 F, 40
C). Whisk the egg till frothy and then whisk in the warm milk until
smooth. Pour the mixture through a sieve into a cold-wetted
ring-mould. Then put it in the fridge to set - it will only take
about 1/2 hour.

Run hot water over the outside of the mould and turn out the jelly.
Fill the middle of the ring with a ladleful of rhubarb compote and
surround with a little scarlet sauce of rosehip or redcurrant jelly
melted in a little hot water.
