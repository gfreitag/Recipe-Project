consistency, put it in a bowl and add shrimp or crab, fish sauce,
salt, pepper, garlic, onions and chives. Drain and dry the tree ears
and add them.  Add the bean thread noodles and blend thoroughly
kneading with the hands.

Brush the rice paper on each side with the beer and set aside.

Cover with a cloth as you work.  They take a minute or two to soften.

Put a heaping spoonful of the filling across the bottom third of the
rice skin.  Tuck away from you twice. Fold the sides over, then
continue to roll. Seal with beaten egg and cornstarch. Fry in oil
heated to about 350F until golden.  Serve with lettuce leaves,
garnishes and dip sauce.

This is from the "Art of Asian Cooking" by Bruce Cost. I was
fortunate to have taken classes from him in Berkeley.
