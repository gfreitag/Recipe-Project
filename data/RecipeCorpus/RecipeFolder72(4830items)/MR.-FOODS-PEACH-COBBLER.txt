Title: MR. FOODS PEACH COBBLER
Categories: Desserts, Pies
Yield: 9 Servings
3/4 c  All-purpose flour, divided
1/2 c  Light brown sugar, divided
3 tb Light brown sugar, divided
1 ts Ground cinnamon
48 oz Sliced peaches, drained
Nonstick baking spray
=======================================================
============== ==== == Preheat the oven to 350 F. In a large bowl,
combine 1/4 cup of flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and the cinnamon; mix
well. Stir in the peaches until evenly coated. Place in an 8 inch
square glass baking dish that has been coated with nonstick baking
spray. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 cup flour and 3
tablespoons brown sugar; sprinkle over the peach mixture. Coat the
top with nonstick baking spray and bake for 25 to
30    minutes, or until the top is lightly browned. Spoon into
individual serving dishes. Note: Why not serve this with scoops of
vanilla ice cream? And for a little extra excitement, how about
topping each serving with a bit of raspberry preserves or some
raspberry sherbet for a great peach melba flavor.
