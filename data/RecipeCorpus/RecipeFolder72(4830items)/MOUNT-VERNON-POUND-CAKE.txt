Cream the butter and flour together very thoroughly and beat the
yolks of the eggs to a thick, almost white, froth with one pound of
granulated sugar. Add one teaspoonful of vanilla and a grating of
mace. Gradually add the creamed butter and flour to the sugar and egg
mixture and whip well, then fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the
eggs, pour into a well-greased and floured tube-pan, scatter a little
grated lemon or orange rind over the top and bake in a moderate (350
F.) oven about one and a quarter hours.
