Title: MICROWAVE PARMESAN HERB MUFFINS
Categories: Breads, Microwave
Yield: 12 Servings
2 c  Flour
1 tb Sugar
1 1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Baking soda
2 tb Buttermilk, powdered
1/2 ts Sage leaves
1/4 c  Cheese, Parmesan, grated
1 1/4 c  Water; hot
1/4 c  Butter
1    Eggs
Preheat oven to 400.  Line 12 muffin cups with paper baking cups. In
large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, sage,
buttermilk powder, and cheese. Blend well. Add hot water, butter, and
egg; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened. Fill prepared
muffin cups 2/3 full. Bake 15-20 minutes, until toothpick inserted
into center comes out clean. Serve hot.

MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS: Prepare muffin batter as directed above. Using
6 cup microwave-safe muffin pan, line each with 2 paper baking cups
to absorb moisture during baking. Fill cups 1/2 full. Sprinkle top of
each muffin with cornflake crumbs.  Microwave 6 muffins on HIGH for 2
1/2 to 3 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out
clean, rotating pan 1/2 turn halfway through baking.  Remove muffins
from pan and immediatedly discard outer baking cups. Cool 1 minute on
wire rack before serving. Repeat with remaining batter.

Sylvia's comments: I don't have a microwave-safe muffin pan, so just
baked them in the oven.  The tops had the tipped-hat look I sometimes
get in breadmachine bread, and Peter commented that the muffins
tasted just like my bread.  It's not a bad recipe, but it's not good
enough that I want to keep it.
