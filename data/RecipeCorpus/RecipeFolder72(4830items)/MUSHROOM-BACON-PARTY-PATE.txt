Title: MUSHROOM-BACON PARTY PATE
Categories: Appetizers
Yield: 1 Loaf
2 lb Mushrooms (fresh),
-chopped very fine
1/2 lb Bacon (or more,
-to taste)
2/3 c  Onion, chopped
-very fine
2/3 c  Celery, chopped
-very fine
4    Eggs
8 oz Cream cheese at
-room temperature
1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
-very fine
2 c  Dry bread crumbs
1 ts Salt
1 ts Rosemary, dried
1 ts Oregano, dried
1/4 ts Black pepper, ground
Fry the bacon and crumble it as fine as possible. Reserve some of the
grease.

Chop the mushrooms, onion, celery and parsley as fine as possible. A
food processor works best, but you can do it by hand if need be.
Saute the onion and celery in the bacon grease until soft, then
remove from the grease and drain.

Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese slightly, and then beat in the eggs.
Add all other ingredients to the eggs/cheese mixture. Mix thoroughly.

Grease a large loaf pan or two small, line with foil, and then grease
the foil.  Pat the mixture into the loaf pan and cover loosely with
foil. Bake for 1 1/2 hours at 400 degrees F.

Let cool completely before serving.  This pate is actually best when
refrigerated before serving.  Serve with crackers, or with bread cut
into shapes with cookie cutters. To make this a more elegant buffet
dish, garnish the top with a thin layer of aspic.

NOTES:

*  This is heavenly stuff for a buffet, and for those people who love
to munch, but hate liver pate.  We found it in a magazine some years
ago. The magazine has long since been forgotten, but this I know by
heart! Yield: 1 large loaf.

*  American bacon is called smoked back bacon in many other places.

: Difficulty:  easy if you have a food processor.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours baking and cooling.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.
