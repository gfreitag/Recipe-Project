Title: NASI GORENG #1
Categories: Grains/rice, Phillipines
Yield: 1 Servings
Cooked rice for 4
1 ea LEEK, cut in rings
150 g  Bean sprouts washed,
-cleaned how you like them
1 ea Egg
300 g  Fillet of pork or chicken,
-cubed small (or a leftover
Of meat, cooked, cut in
-small cubes)
1 ea Chili pepper, chopped (or 1
-teaspoon sambal ulek)
Oil
1 ea Big or 2 small onions,
-chopped fine
Soy sauce (i prefer the
-sweet type)
(fresh) ginger
1/2 ts Trassi (if available)
Heat oil in wok or big pan. Add trassi, powder it first between your
fingers. Fry onion, garlic and ginger for 2-3 minutes until onion is
translucent and the kitchen smells great. Fry the meat if it is raw;
if not wait a few lines :) Add leek and chili pepper, fry 2-3 more
minutes. Add egg, stir well and IMMEDIATELY add rice. The egg should
set after the rice is stirred in so everything gets a bit sticky. Add
the cooked meat, if you're using that. Fry for 5-8 minutes, stirring
really well. Add a little more oil if necessary. Add the beansprouts,
heat these for maximum 1 minute or they will get soft
:-( Add soy sauce to taste. This is a very basic dish. You should eat
something else with it, like sate (broiled meat w. peanutbutter
sauce), or a vegetable dish (stirfried). Atjar Tjampoer (sweet/sour
pickled vegetables) cannot be missed, as well as a fried or poached
egg on top of the nasi (one egg per eater). Serve with prawn
crackers, preferably home baked (if you can buy them raw anywhere?).
