1. Working with one fourth of the dough at a time, roll it out to
1/8 inch thick. Use it to line 3-inch tarts. Line dough in a tart pan
with aluminium foil and fill with uncooked rice, beans or pastry
weights. Bake at 375øF. for 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool
tart shells and remove weights and foil. Slip shells carefully from
pans and cool completely.
2. Combine Montrachet, butter, cream and eggs in the bowl of a food
processor fitted with a steel blade, and process until completely
smooth. Shut off motor. Season filling to taste; chvre can be quite
salty and peppery and may not need additonal seasoning. Stir in the
scallions or chopped green onions.
3. Arrange the cooled shells on a baking sheet and spoon in the
filling. Slide the sheet onto the center rack of a preheated 375øF.
oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tarts are puffed and
brown. Serve immediately. Approx. 24 two-inch tarts.
