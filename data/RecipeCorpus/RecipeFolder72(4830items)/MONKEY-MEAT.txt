Title: MONKEY MEAT
Categories: Main
Yield: 1 Servings
SEE DIRECTIONS:
The pork is sliced, and then marinated in 7-up. That's right, 7-up.
She says that if you want, you can add a little garlic and/or onion
to the marinade.  The pork is then skewered and grilled, basting with
soy sauce while cooking.  The MSG is an ingredient that I'd add, but
may not be for everyone.

It sounds bizarre, but the 7-up would give a citrusy taste like the
lemon juice you mentioned.

I gotta try this one.
