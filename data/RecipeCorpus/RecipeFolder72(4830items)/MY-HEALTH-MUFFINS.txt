1 c  Rye flour
1 c  Soya flour

1/2 ts Salt
2    Eggs
1 1/2 c  Brown sugar

buttermilk Preheat oven to 325.  Add soda to milk and let foam. Put
ingredients in mixer and beat 3 minutes after each, in order now
given. Eggs, sugar, salt, oil, milk.  Add dry ingredients, fruit and

know if this is really necessary.
