Categories: Salads, Mom

2 cn Green beans, cut
1 cn Wax beans, cut
1 cn Red kidney beans
1 cn Garbanzos
5 sm Onions (or 2-3 big ones)
1 c  Sugar
1/2 c  Wine vinegar

Drain juice from all cut beans and save.  Drain kidney beans and
garbanzos; rinse (do not retain juice).  Mix kidney beans and
garbanzos. Peel onions, slice, and separate rings.

To layer:  1/4 of the onions; 1/3 of the green beans; 1/3 of the wax
beans; 1/3 of the kidney/garbanzos. Repeat. Shake from side to side
to settle.

Marinade:  Of the retained juice, you should have a little more than
2 cups (if not, add water).  Add sugar and vinegars. (Can use all
wine vinegar instead of 1/2 wine and 1/2 cider vinegar.) Rub spices
in hand to break up; stir into juice.  "Taste to make sure both
sourer and sweeter than you want the end product."

Pour marinade over beans.  If uncovered, make additional liquid (1/2
water to 1/4 sugar and 1/4 vinegar). Set for 2 days.

Can also add cucumbers, avocado, sweet bell pepper and/or pimento.
