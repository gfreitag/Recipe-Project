Here I adapted an 18th century English spice cake recipe which also
makes nice cupcakes.

Powder saffron, work into butter.  Cream butter and sugar, add eggs,
one at a time.  Add vanilla and caraway. Sift together dry
ingredients. Add dry ingredients to batter alternately with milk. Mix
in zest. Pour into greased, floured sheet cake or cupcake pan.
Preheat oven and bake at 350F (175C) for about 1 1/4 hrs. Check after
1 hour. Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then on rack.  Serve with dollop
of Currant Hard Sauce.

CURRANT HARD SAUCE:

Powder saffron, work into chilled cream cheese.  Cream together
butter and cheese.  Beat until light and fluffy. Mix in remaining
ingredients and chill. Serve at room temperature.
