Title: OLD & FRESH EGGS
Categories: Chinese, Appetizers
Yield: 1 Batch
2    Preserved eggs

1 tb Chicken stock
1/8    Level teaspoon salt
Oil or fat
2 ts Soy sauce
2 ts Sesame oil
1/2    Level teaspoon MSG
This is another treatment of Thousand Year Eggs.  It's a bit more
complex than just eating them with a dip, but is still simple and
elegant. I'd consider the use of MSG as optional, but authentic. The
preservation of eggs by alkaline ash turns the white to brown and the
yolk to green. This colour change is actually very beautiful. Gently
crack the shells of the preserved eggs and remove the egg white
(brown) carefully, reserving it. Mash the yolks and combine them with
the fresh eggs, chicken stock and salt.  Grease a bowl and pour in
the egg mixture. Steam it for about 20 minutes.  When cool, loosen
the egg from the bowl, slice it in half and cut each half into thins
slices. Chop the egg white (brown) very finely, and arrange the
slices around it. Mix the soy sauce, sesame oil and MSG together, and
carefully spoon this sauce over the slices only. The sauce will
gradually seep into the egg.
