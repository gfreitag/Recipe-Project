To make honey walnuts:  Butter a small cookie sheet. Melt butter and
honey in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add walnuts. Cook,
stirring often for 5 minutes until walnuts start to carmelize. Spread
nut mixture on cookie sheets to cool.

To make minted pears:  Bring water to boiling in a large saucepan.
Remove from heat.  Add teabags and 1/2 c honey, stirring to dissolve
honey. Cover and steep for 5 minute. Peel pears, leaving stems
intact. Rub each with lemon juice to prevent discoloring.

Remove tea bags from tea.  Bring tea to a simmer.  Add pears. Cover
and simmer for 10-20 minutes until tender. Time depends on the
ripeness and size of the pears.

To serve:  Pears may be served hot or cold in poaching syrup. Spoon 3
pears into each of 4 serving dishes (or one apiece if using larger
pears) Sprinkle with honey walnuts.
