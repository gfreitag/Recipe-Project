Title: MARK'S SALMON SPREAD
Categories: Chile-heads, Fish, Spreads
Yield: 1 Servings
8 oz Cream cheese
1    Stalk celery -- minced
1/2 c  Crushed walnuts
1/2 c  Minced green onion
1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
1/2 ts Ground coriander
1    Cucumber -- skinned and
Sliced
Thinly
1 pk Wheatsworth crackers
Juice of one lemon (no lame
Bottled
Stuff!)
Fresh ground black pepper
24    Three inch by one inch
sl Smoked
Salmon
1 bn Fresh dill
Mix cheese, celery, walnuts, green onion, lemon juice, cayenne and
coriander until thoroughly combined. Obviously the heat can be
adjusted to taste, but you don't want to overpower the other flavors,
especially the salmon.  I figure if half your guests complain it's
too hot, and half say it could have been hotter, it's about right.

Place from  to 1 tsp. of the cheese mixture on the end of one of the
salmon strips, sprinkle with black pepper, and roll up jellyroll
style. These steps can be done a couple hours ahead of time, just
cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.

To serve, arrange crackers on serving tray.  Top each one with a
cucumber slice   Place a salmon roll on top of the cucumber slice and
garnish with a sprig of dill. Serves 5 to 10 people depending on how
