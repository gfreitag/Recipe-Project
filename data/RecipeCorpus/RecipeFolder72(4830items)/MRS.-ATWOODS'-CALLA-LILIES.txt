BATTER: Beat eggs until foamy; gradually beat in sugar until well
blended. In separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Add
flour mixture to egg mixture; mix thoroughly. Batter will be runny.
Drop batter, 2 tsp at a time, about 2 inches apart, onto greased
baking sheet. Bake only 6 cookies at a time. Bake in 400F oven for 5
to 8 minutes or until golden and top springs back when lightly
touched. Using metal spatula, remove cookies, one at a time, from
baking sheet. Pinch and hold bottom half of each circle together,
turning sides inward, to form calla lily shape. Let cool on wire
rack. (Cookies can be made ahead to this point, and stored in
airtight containers.) Filling: Whip cream; stir in sugar and vanilla.
Spoon a 'tongue' or thin line of grape jelly down centre of each
lily, running into pinch end. Pipe or spoon whipped cream into
pinched centre. Serve immediately.
