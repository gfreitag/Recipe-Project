Title: OATMEAL CINNAMON SCONES
Categories: Breads
Yield: 6 Servings
1/4 c  Oatmeal
1 ts Salt
1 3/4 c  Flour
6 tb Butter, cut into 1/2-inch
-cubes
1/4 c  Sugar
1 ts Cinnamon
1/2 c  Buttermilk OR:
1/2 c  Cream OR:
1/2 c  Milk
1/4 c  Brown sugar, packed
1 lg Egg, beaten
1 1/2 ts Baking powder (dbl acting)
2 ts Vanilla extract
1 ts Baking soda
1/8 ts Grated orange zest
Position rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees.
Into a large bowl, sift the flour, sugars, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt. Add oatmeal & mix together. Distribute the butter
cubes over the flour mixture. Using your fingertips, quickly rub the
butter cutes into the flour mixture, until the mixture resembles
coarse meal.

In a medium bowl, stir together the buttermilk, egg, vanilla, & zest.

Add the liquid mixture to the flour mixture. With a large rubber
spatula, using as few strokes as possible, stir gently until the
dough is moistened and begins to cling together. Handling the dough
as little as possible, stir until all the ingredients are completely
combined.

Using a 1/3-c. measuring cup, drop the dough onto an ungreased baking
sheet, leaving at least 1-inch between the scones. Bake 16 to 18
minutes, until the scones are golden brown. Cool the scones on the
baking sheet set on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Using a mental
spatula, transfer the scones to the wire rack and cool completely.
Serve warm or store completely cooled scones in an airtight container
at room temperature.
