*Asian stores sell dried galangal, laos or kha in pieces or ground
into a powder. You can substitute one teaspoon grated fresh
gingerroot for galangal powder.

In a large saucepan, mix coconut milk and galangal.
Bring to a boil over medium heat.

Add lime leaves, salt, soy sauce and rice syrup.
Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes.

Add mushrooms, green beans, black pepper and red pepper flakes.
Simmer, uncovered, until beans are tender-crisp, about 5 to 10
minutes.

Spoon hot mixture over rice. Garnish with fresh mint and lime
wedges, and serve.
