Yield: 12 Servings
-Dorothy Cross TMPJ72B
-Cake:
1 lb (4 sticks) unsalted butter,
-cut into pieces
1 lb Semisweet chocolate
1 c  Strong coffee
2 c  Sugar
8    Large eggs; room temperature
-Frosting:
1 c  Heavy cream
1/4 c  Powdered sugar
1/4 ts Vanilla
-Chocolate Flakes
CAKE: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Completely line the bottom and
sides of a 10-inch cake pan with foil, allowing some of the foil to
extend beyond the top of the pan. Smooth out the foil as much as
possible. Generously coat with some of the butter. Melt the chocolate
with the remaining butter, coffee, and sugar over low heat. Simmer
over low heat until the sugar dissolves. Beat the eggs until thick,
about 5 minutes. Stir into the chocolate mixture. Pour into the
prepared pan. Bake for approximately 50 minutes, or until the center
is just set. Cool completely in the pan. Cover and refrigerate in the
pan until firm, at least 8 hours or overnight. FROSTING: A few hours
prior to serving, whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla. Invert
cake onto a serving platter. Carefully remove the foil. Frost the
cake with the whipped cream. Garnish with the Chocolate Flakes. To
make Chocolate Flakes, melt semisweet chocolate and spread on a
marble slab or large flat plate. Let the chocolate harden. Scrape
against it with a knife and it will flake into thin pieces. Source:
