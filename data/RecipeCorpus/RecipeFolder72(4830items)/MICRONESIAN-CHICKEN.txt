Squeeze the juice of the lemons over the chicken and let stand while
preparing the rest of the marinade.

In a large bowl, combine the beer, soy sauce, chopped onion and
chopped garlic.  Drain the lemon juice from above into this mixture.

Put the chicken in the marinade, cover and refrigerate for 3 hours
minimum. It's better to marinate overnight. Make sure chicken is
covered by marinade.

chicken is turned, re- dip the pieces in the marinade.
