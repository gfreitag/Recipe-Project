Title: MEXICAN STYLE CHORIZO
Categories: Meat
Yield: 8 Servings
2 lb Boneless pork butt or
-shoulder
1    Clove Garlic
2 tb Chile powder
1 tb Paprika
2 ts Mexican oregano; well
-crumbled
1 ts Coarse salt (i use margarita
-salt)
3/4 ts Ground cumin
1/2 ts Ground cayenne chile
1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
Enough pork fat if necessary
-to make a 2-to-1 meat to
-fat ratio
Cut the meat (and fat, if necessary) into chunks. Spread out on a pie
pan or cookie sheet and place in the freezer to chill (not long
enough to freeze, just long enough to become firm). Grind the meat
and fat together twice, using a coarse blade. Remove the skin from
the garlic clove, finely dice it, spinkle it with coarse salt, and
crush it with the back of a dinner fork. Add garlic and spices to the
wine vinegar and knead it well into the meat/fat mixture. Cover and
refrigerate at least a couple of hours or overnight. The sausage can
be stuffed into prepared casings or formed into patties or
appropriate size bulk portions and refrigerated for up to 3 days
before use after which any remaining should be frozen.

Pork sausage (and chorizo in particular) don't stand up too well to
lengthy freezing and should be used up within 2 or 3 months.

BTW - Even though fennel seed is more typical in Italian sausage
(usually whole), I add some CRUSHED fennel seed to my chorizo...
