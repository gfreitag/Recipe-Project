Vidalia Onions are the sweetest summer onion you can find! Enhance
their natural mild and sweet flavor with the above marinating recipe.
Slice the onions 1/4 inch thick, separating rings. Ingredients are
more estimated than measured, add or subtract to your own individual
taste. Mix all ingredients in a container you can cover and shake,
keep in the refrigerator. Marinade at least 24 hours before serving.
You can continue to add more onions to mixture as necessary for up to
four additions. After that, drain, make new marinade and transfer
onions. If some have not been rotated through, throw out the very
soft slices.
