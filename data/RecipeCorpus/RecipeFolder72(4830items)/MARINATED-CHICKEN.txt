chicken. Combine oil, vinegar, onion powder, garlic powder, pepper,
marjoram, rosemary, and salt. Place chicken in mixture and marinate
in the refrigerator overnight. Turn chicken a couple of times while
marinating.

Cook on the grill or in the oven (I use 350 degrees about 1 hour)
dipping chicken once or twice in the marinade as it cooks.

It's even better the next day after it's cooled in the refrigerator.
