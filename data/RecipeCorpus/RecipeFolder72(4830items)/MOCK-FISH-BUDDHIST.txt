1/2 ts Sugar
1/3 c  Water
Sprinkle potatoes with flour and deep-fry until golden.
Drain and set aside. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the oil,
reheat an add onion. Stir-fry 10 seconds and add snow peas and wood
ears. Stir-fry another 10 seconds and add salt, sugar and water.
Bring to rapid boil, stirring constantly, and cook until peas are

Wood ears are a type of mushroom or shelf fungus. When soaked it
has a crunchy, gelatinous texture with little taste. If you can't
find them, I imagine that you could use the dried mushrooms although
they wouldn't give exactly the same effect. A closer substitute would
be dried jellyfish, but if you're some- where that sells dried
jellyfish, I'm sure that they have wood ears as well...
