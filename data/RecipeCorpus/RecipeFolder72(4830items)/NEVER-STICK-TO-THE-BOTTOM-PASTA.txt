Title: NEVER STICK TO THE BOTTOM PASTA
Categories: Info
Yield: 1 Recipe
1    Pasta
When its time to cook your pasta and you have trouble with it
sticking to the bottom, just follow these instructions:

Bring your water to a boil as you usually do. Add your Pasta (any
kind). Bring to another rolling boil. Remove from heat. Put lid on.
Let sit the same length of time as you would let cook. NO PEEKING

Works every time and you don't have to watch it other than making
sure it doesn't overflow if you put the lid on too soon after it
begins to boil.
