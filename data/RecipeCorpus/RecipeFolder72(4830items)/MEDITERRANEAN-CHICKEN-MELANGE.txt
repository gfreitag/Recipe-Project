Place the chicken in a single layer, skin-side down, in a large
baking dish.  Spoon the sauce over the chicken; cover with foil and
bake in 350 F oven for 30 minutes.

Turn the chicken; spoon sauce over chicken and bake, uncovered,
about 30 minutes more, or until chicken is fork tender.

Remove the chicken from the oven; arrange the artichoke hearts
around the chicken.  Sprinkle cheese over all. Cover loosely with
foil and allow to stand for 5 minutes before serving.

When ready to serve, use warm serving plates and mound your
pasta onto the plates first.  Place the chicken onto the pasta, and
pour some of the pan juices over the chicken and pasta.

Garnish with basil and black olives.
