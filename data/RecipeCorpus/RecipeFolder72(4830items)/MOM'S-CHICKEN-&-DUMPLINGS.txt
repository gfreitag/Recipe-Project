Title: MOM'S CHICKEN & DUMPLINGS
Categories: Poultry, Mom
Yield: 6 Servings
1    Chicken
1 ts Garlic salt
5 c  Flour
3 lg Eggs
1/2 ts Baking powder
1/2 ts Salt
1 ts Pepper
Cook hen in pressure cooker with lots of salt and MSG, plus 1 teaspoon
garlic salt.  (If you don't use MSG, just omit it instead of
lecturing me, okay?)  Cover chicken with water and close. Place 15-lb
weight on top and cook over medium-high heat.  When the weight starts
"popping" 2 to 3 times a minute, cook 15 minutes. Cool the chicken
and de-bone.

Mix flour, salt, 1/2 teaspoon MSG and a little less than 1/2 teaspoon
baking powder.  Blend eggs with 1 1/4 Cup *cool* chicken stock from
pot (1/3 of it should be fat). Stir into flour a little at a time. On
flour-covered board, knead dough and roll it out till thinner than a
nickel.  Cut dumplings (about 2 inches wide by 10 inches, or however
long possible). Stack well-floured dumplings onto plate.

In large pot, bring the rest of the stock to a boil over medium-high
heat. Add the chunks of chicken alternately with the dumplings;
quickly pushing them below the surface of the liquid as you add them.
DON'T FOLD THE DUMPLINGS!

Keep mixture boiling at all times.  Lower heat; cover and cook for
12-15 minutes.  Don't lift the lid for the first 10 minutes.

Add 1 teaspoon pepper to broth --> might need to add additional stock
during the cooking process.
