=======================================================
============== ==== == Preheat the oven to 375. In a medium-sized
bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, the
Parmesan cheese, eggs, parsley and salt until well blended. Pour half
of the spaghetti sauce over the bottom of a 9 X 13 baking dish. Spoon
the cheese mixture over the lasagna noodles, distributing evenly, and
roll up tightly. Place the rill-ups seam side down on the spaghetti
sauce in the bottom of the baking dish; top with the remaining sauce.
Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese and bake for 35 to 40
minutes, or until heated through. NOTE: For lighter roll-ups, use
reduced-fat ricotta cheese, part-skim mozzarella cheese, and even a
reduced-fat spaghetti sauce.
