Title: MULLED ROSEMARY WINE & BLACK TEA
Categories: Beverages, Seasonings
Yield: 2 Quarts
1    Bottle claret; OR...
- other full-bodied red wine
1 qt Black tea
-- pref. Assam or Darjeeling
1/4 c  Mild honey
1/3 c  Sugar; or to taste
2    Oranges
-- sliced thin and seeded
2    Cinnamon sticks (3-inch)
6    Whole cloves
3    Rosemary sprigs
The aroma of this beverage is inviting and the punch can be kept warm
over very low heat for a few hours, which makes the house smell
wonderful. If you have leftovers, remove the oranges and rosemary,
let the punch cool to room temperature, then refrigerate. Reheated
gently with fresh oranges and rosemary, the punch will be a bit
stronger, but still quite enjoyable.

DIRECTIONS: =========== Pour the wine and tea into a noncorrodible
saucepan.  Add the honey, sugar, oranges, spices, and rosemary. Heat
over low heat until barely steaming. Stir until the honey is
dissolved.

Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and let stand for at least 30
minutes. When ready to serve, reheat until just steaming and serve
hot.
