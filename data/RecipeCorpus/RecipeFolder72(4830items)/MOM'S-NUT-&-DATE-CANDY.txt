Title: MOM'S NUT & DATE CANDY
Categories: Candies, Mom
Yield: 1 Batch
1 c  Nuts, finely chopped
-(walnuts, pecans, etc.)
1 c  Dates, finely chopped
2 c  Sugar, granulated
1/2 c  Water (up to 3/4 cup)
1 tb Karo
Boil a syrup of the sugar, water and Karo; stop as or before it
reaches the soft ball stage.  Let cool. Beat in the dates until they
"disintegrate," then the nuts.

Wet a dish towel in cold water.  Spoon the candy along the middle of
the towel in piles.  Fold towel over; roll it, pressing firmly
constantly. Leave to cool and harden. Slice approximately 1/4-inch
pieces. Might want to roll slices in coconut, chopped nuts, etc. (Mom
never did, tho'.)
