grilling.)

Use very low charcoal fire with rack set as high as possible. Grill
ribs 5 to 30 min. per side depending on heat and temperature of ribs.
Ribs should have light outer crust and be heated throughout. (longer
cooking produces better ribs) If you prefer juicy ribs, coat with
basting sauce just before removing from grill. Otherwise serve dry
with sauce on the side. Remove from grill cut into serving size and
serve. Basting sauce : mix all ingredients in a bowl. Recipe is
easily halved or doubled. keep 2:1 proportion of sauce to rud.
