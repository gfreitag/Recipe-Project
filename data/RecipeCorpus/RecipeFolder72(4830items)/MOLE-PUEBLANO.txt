Title: MOLE PUEBLANO
Categories: Sauces, Poultry
4    chiles mulatos
Yield: 1 Pt
4    chiles anchos
4    chiles guajillos
4    chiles pasillas
2    cups whole tomatoes
1    large onion
4    garlic cloves
1/2    cup almonds
1    plaintain banana
1/2    cup peanuts
1    piece toasted bread
2    corn tortillas
1    tablet abuelita chocolate 1/8 cup sesame seeds Oil for
frying

De-vein chiles and remove seeds. Peel onion and cut in quarters. Cut
plaintain banana in 1/4 inch pieces. Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a pan
and fry all ingredients in batches, starting with the chiles and
ending with the nuts, tomatoes and chocolate. As you fry all the
ingredients, set them aside. Puree them in a blender, thinning them
with chicken broth. Consistency should be fairly thick, but just thin
enough to blend to a smooth sauce. Cook over low flame for two hours,
or until Mole turns a dark reddish brown colour. Serve over chicken
or turkey, accompanied by Mexican rice and corn tortillas.
