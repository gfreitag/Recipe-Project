Title: NUER SAWAN (HEAVENLY BEEF)
Categories: Thai, Beef
Yield: 1 Servings
1 lb Lean Beef
2 ts Ground Coriander Seeds
1/2 ts Ground Cumin - Coarse
1 tb Good Quality Fish Sauce
1/2 c  Sugar
Oil for Frying
Wash beef, and trim of all fat and gristle.  Use a very sharp knife,
slice the beef into fairly large, very thin, sheets. Place the pieces
of beef into a bowl and add fish sauce. Mix, and lightly knead by
hand till well mixed and the beef had "soften".  Add sugar, and
continue to knead till the sugar is dissolved and well mixed in. To
taste, take a small piece, and fry till done, and taste.  Adjust
tastes, if required, by adding more sugar or fish sauce to the
uncooked beef.

Add coarsely ground coriander seeds and cumin.  Mix together well.
Remove the beef pieces, spread out in a single layer on a wire rack
and dry in the sun. When top side is dry, turn the beef pieces over
to dry the other side. Caution....do NOT over-dry, or the end result
will be dry and hard.

When properly dried, the beef may be stored in airtight container -
refrigeration is recommended.  To serve, add a little oil to a hot
pan, and add the beef pieces when the oil is hot. Use medium to low
heat, and fry till the beef pieces are cooked and crispy. Remove from
pan, and drain of excess oil.  Blot off remaining oil with paper
towels, and serve when cool.
