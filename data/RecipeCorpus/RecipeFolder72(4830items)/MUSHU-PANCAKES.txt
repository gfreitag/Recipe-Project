2 c  All-purpose unbleached flour
3/4    Boiling water
Recipe by: Wok Wiz Place the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the
boiling water a little at a time. Add enugh water to make a lumpy
dough. When dough holds together, turn it out to a floured board,
knead until smooth, app. five minutes. With your hands, roll into a
log about 1 1/2 inches thick.  Cut the dough into 1 1/2 inch-chunks.
Roll each chunk into a ball betweenyour palms, and flatten into a
patty (can also use side of a cleaver to do this.)  Brush on side of
a patty with a small amount of sesame (Asian type only) oil, and
align the oiled side with another patty, press together.  Roll the
two pancakes together with a rolling pin into a 5-6" diameter. Heat a
dry skillet or crepe pan, with no oil. When the skillet is hot, put

botto turn the pancakes over. When both sides are lightly specked,
remove from heat. Continue this process for all pancakes. When
pancakes are cool enou to handle, carefully separate by peeling them
apart. Place into a steamer until pancakes are ready to be served
