Because of its Thanksgiving associations, pumpkin has become the
pre-eminent squash for pie-making. Many 19th century connoisseurs,
however, insisted that other winter squashes had a more refined
flavor. This recipe (Mabel Gray's from "Yankee Magazine's Great New
England Recipes," 1983) would also work with acorn and other squashes.

Heat milk and squash together in double boiler. In bowl, mix sugar,
flour, salt, ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon. Then add eggs. Beat well
with rotary beater. Add mixture to milk and squash in double boiler.
Stir together well. Do not boil.

Pour warm filling into pie shell. Bake at 400'F. 10 minutes, then
reduce heat to 350'F. and bake until pie sets, about 15-20 minutes.
Makes 6-8 servings.
