Title: MICROWAVE BERRY JAM
Categories: Jelly/jam, Fruits, Microwave, Kooknet
Yield: 2 Half pints
2 pt Berries; Raspberries,
-Blackberries or
-Boysenberries
3 c  Sugar
Place berries in an 8 cup measuring bowl or larger microwave-safe
bowl and crush lightly. Stir in the sugar and let stand 5 minutes.
Cover the container with plastic wrap and turn back a corner of the
plastic so steam can escape. Microwave on HIGH (100%) 4-5 minutes, or
until the mixture has come to a boil. Continue to microwave on MEDIUM
(50%) for 8 minutes.

(Caution, this can boil over easily. If your microwave oven has no
glass dish on the bottom, place the bowl on a plate to catch any
juices.) Remove plastic wrap and cook on MEDIUM (50%) for 8 minutes
more.

To test the jam, dip a spoon in the mixture. Run your finger through
the mixture on the back of the spoon. If it leaves a distinct trail
without closing in on itself, the jam is done. To double check, spoon
a bit on a small saucer and place it in the freezer for 1 minute. It
should have a jam-like consistency. If the jam needs more cooking,
microwave on MEDIUM (50%) for a few more minutes. Store in the
refrigerator.
