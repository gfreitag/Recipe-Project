1 Combine hot water and 2 teaspoons coffee granules in a medium bowl;
stir well. Add brownie mix, teaspoon vanilla, and egg whites; stir
until well blended. Pour mixture into a 9-inch pieplate coated with
cooking spray. Bake at 325 degrees for 22 minutes. Let crust cool
completely.

2 Combine milk, 2 tablespoons Kahlua, 1 teaspoon coffee granules,
remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla, and pudding mix in a bowl; beat at
medium speed of a mixer 1 minute. Gently fold in 1-1/2 cups whipped
topping. Spread pudding mixture evenly over brownie crust.

3 Combine remaining 1 tablespoon Kahlua and remaining 1 teaspoon
coffee granules in a bowl; stir well. Gently fold in remaining 1-1/2
cups whipped topping. Spread whipped topping mixture evenly over
pudding mixture. Garnish with chocolate curls, if desired. Serve
immediately, or store loosely covered in refrigerator. Yield: 8
servings (serving size: 1 wedge).

4 Nonalcoholic Mocha Version: When making the pudding mixture,
substitute 2 tablespoons 1% low-fat milk for the Kahlua. In the
topping, omit the Kahlua, and dissolve the coffee granules in 1
tablespoon water.

5 Note: Store remaining brownie mix in a zip-top heavy-duty plastic
bag in refrigerator; reserved brownie mix can be used for another pie
or to make a small pan of brownies. To make brownies, combine
reserved brownie mix (about 2 cups), 1/4 cup water, and 1 lightly
beaten egg white in a bowl. Stir just until combined. Spread into an
8-inch square pan coated with vegetable cooking spray. Bake at 350
degrees for 23 to 25 minutes.
