DISSOLVE THE YEAST IN THE WATER. Beat the butter until creamy, then
beat in the sugar, salt, honey, egg and egg yolks. Beat in half of
the flour, then the milk, then the remaining flour. Set aside in a
warm place to rise until doubled. Deflate the dough, then divide into
24 pieces. Shape the pieces into 2-inch squares and set on an
18x24-inch baking sheet which has been lined with buttered parchment
or foil. Brush with milk and sprinkle crumbs over the tops and sides
of the buns. Cover and let rise until doubled. Bake at 400F for 20
minutes. MIX THE ALMOND PASTE and egg white until smooth. Add the
remaining ingredients in order and mix until smooth. Chill, then
break into coarse crumbs. This recipe was adapted from "Modern Pastry
