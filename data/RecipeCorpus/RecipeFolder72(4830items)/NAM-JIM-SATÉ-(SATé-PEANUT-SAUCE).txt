Categories: Sauces, Indonesian
Yield: 1 Batch
14 oz Coconut milk
1/2 c  Chicken stock
1/2 c  Peanuts, uncooked
1 tb Garlic, crushed
1 tb Red curry paste
1 tb Nam prik pao; ([roasted]
-chili paste in oil)
1 tb Palm sugar
1 tb Fish sauce
1 tb Lime juice
In a wok or large heavy skillet, dry roast the peanuts until they
start to turn toasty brown.  Bite one to check that it is cooked
through (careful - they're hot).

Discard any brown peanut "skins" and put the peanuts in a
liquidiser/blender or food processor.

Separate the coconut milk, add a cup of thick coconut cream to the
blender, and process until smooth.  Add the garlic, curry paste, nam
prik pao, sugar, fish sauce, and lime juice and process until mixed
thoroughly.

Combine the remaining coconut milk with the chicken stock, and then
slowly add this to the running blender until a suitable consistency
is achieved.
